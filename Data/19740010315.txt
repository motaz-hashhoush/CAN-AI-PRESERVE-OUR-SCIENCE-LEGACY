Thus, the setting for the conduct of the Apollo\n17 landing was a unique place in which to carry out\nmany investigations\nand to return lunar materials that\ncould aid in answering many fundamental\nquestions.\nFrom the standpoint both of geologic features and\n\nthis final volume\nmarks the end of the Apollo\nPreliminary\nScience\nReports.\nFrom every aspect,\nApollo 17 was indeed a fitting capstone to the Apollo\nmissions.\nIts awesome\nand magnificent\nmidnight\nlaunch, its flawless operation,\nits 72-hr lunar stay\ntime, its deployment\nof scientific instrumentation,\nits\nreturn of the richest collection\nof lunar materials\nfrom any lunar site, its orbital science coverage, and\nits glorious splashdown\nin the Pacific Ocean surely\nmarked Apollo 17 as the mission most impressively\nexemplifying\nthe Apollo Program.\nThe Taurus-Littrow\nlanding site for Apollo 17 was\npicked as a location\nwhere rocks both older and\nyounger than those previously returned\nfrom other\nApollo\nmissions and from the Luna 16 and 20\nmissions might be found. For this mission, it was\nhoped that the discovery of younger basaltic rocks,\ndiffering\nin crystallization\nage from the 3.2 to 3.7\nbillion\nyears of previously\nreturned\nmare basalts,\nwould lead to an improved\nunderstanding\nboth of\nvolcanism and of the thermal history of the Moon.\nSimilarly, it was hoped that the discovery of rocks\nformed earlier than 3.7 to 4.0 billion years ago would\nlead to further understanding\nboth of the early lunar\ncrust and of material\npresent at the time of the\nformation of the Moon.\nThe identification\nand selection\nresulted from Astronaut\nWorden\'s\n\nMachiavelli\n\nof samples returned,\nthe Taurus-Littrow\nregion represents the most diverse landing site of the Apollo\nmissions. Returned samples include a variety of mare\nbasalts resembling those of the Apollo 11, 12, and 15\nmissions and Luna 16; a variety of breccias (including\nKREEP-like,\nanorthositic,\nand soil types) similar to\nthose of the Apollo 14, 15, and 16 missions and Luna\n20; two coarse-grained\nigneous rocks of a type not\nfound on previous missions; dark mantle soils that\nappear to be erosional\nproducts\nof basalts; light\nmantle\nsoils that\nappear\nto be dominantly\nthe\nerosional products\nof highlands; a variety of exotic\nglasses; and, most characteristic\nof this mission,\nboulder samples that provide the best alternative\nto\ninaccessible outcrops of the lunar surface.\nAt Shorty Crater, orange and black glasses that\nwere hopefully\nyoung volcanic material were observed and sampled. However, the old age of the glass\n\nof the landing site\nApollo 15 orbital\n\nand the astronaut\nobservations\nand photographs\nsuggest that this impact crater apparently\nexcavated\nlayers of very old pyroclastic\nmaterial. Throughout\n\nobservations\n(he noticed\ndark patterns that looked\nlike cinder cones in the Littrow region of the Moon)\nand from detailed analysis of the Apollo 15 imagery.\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\nAPOLLO\n17PRELIMINARY\nSCIENCE\nREPORT\n\nthislandingite,10to20percent each\ns\nof\n\nsoil sample\nconsists of these "exotic" glasses, apparently\nbrought\nfrom subsurface layers and distributed by the gardening effect. The Apollo\n17 mission\nprovided\nthe\nscientific world with the best lunar sample return in\nboth potential quantity of information\nand variety of\nsample types. Except for the sampling of one possible\noutcrop on Apollo 15, the Apollo 17 boulder samples\nshould allow the best possibility of placing returned\nlunar materials in their proper structural\nand stratigraphic\ncontext.\nOne example\nof how sampling\ntechniques have become more sophisticated\nsince the\nApollo 11 mission was the collection of samples from\na large boulder at station 6. One part of the boulder\nwas vesicular and green gray; the other part was\npractically\nnonvesicular and blue gray. Samples were\ntaken from both parts of this boulder, as well as from\nvarious locations\nup to and through\nthe contact.\nFurther analysis suggests that the blue-gray material\nreacted to become more vesicular near the contact;\nthis material also occurs as fragments\nwithin the\ngreen-gray\nmaterial\non the vesicular\nside of the\ncontact. Sampling of this type provides insight into\nthe evolution of the older crustal materials.\nKnowledge of the Moon was also enhanced by the\ncorrelation\nof the traverse experiments,\nwhich provided better understanding\nof the site\'s subsurface\nrelationships,\nobtained\nfrom the interpretation\nof\nseismic, electrical properties,\nand gravitational\ndata.\nSeismic traverseexperiments\nindicate that basaltic\nflows extend to a depth of approximately\n1.2 km.\nThe traverse\nlimits to the\nthe observed\na model for\nmassifs. This\n\ngravimeter\nexperiment\nhas provided\ndensity of the underlying\nmaterial, and\ngravity anomaly allows development\nof\nmass variations in the valley and in the\nmodel may be of significance in inter-\n\npreting the major mascons of the Moon. The electrical properties experiment\nhas confirmed the gravity\nand seismic data by establishing\nthat the basaltic\nthickness is between l and 1.5 kin. These data also\nshow that the regolith is relatively thick, perhaps 20\nto 40 m, with some variation\nin thickness.\nThe\ndielectric., constant and loss tangent measurements\nare\nin good agreement with previously determined values\nobtained from lunar samples and ground observations.\n,The heat flow measurements\nat the Apollo 17 site\nhave been shown to be roughly the same as those at\nthe Apollo 15 site, indicating\nthat, at least on the\nnear side of the Moon, a reasonable value of heat flow\nmay be 2 X 10 -6 tO 3 \xc3\x97 10 -6 W/cm2/sec.\n\nSeveral other surface and orbital experiments\nwere\nconducted\non the Apollo 17 mission, which include\nthe lunar atmospheric\ncomposition,\nthe lunar ejecta\nand meteorites,\nthe lunar tidal gravimeter, the ultraviolet spectrometer,\nthe infrared scanning radiometer,\nand the lunar sounder. At the time of this writing,\nthere are insufficient\ndata to give an overview from\nthese findings, which, in the future, are expected\nto\ngive additional information\nabout Taurus-Littrow\nand\nthat region of the Moon covered by the command\nand service module groundtrack.\nThe sections that follow present the preliminary\nresults obtained in the analysis of the Apollo 17 data\nto date. As will be seen, the Apollo 17 data fill some\ngaps in knowledge about the near-side surface of the\nMoon but, at the same time, raise many other\nquestions. However, one cannot conclude a report on\nthe Apollo 17 mission without again emphasizing that\nit was a fitting finale to the Apollo Program from the\nstandpoint\nboth of operations\nand of science. It is\nalso important\nto review what has been learned in the\nbrief 3.5 yr from the first lunar landing of Apollo 11\non July 20, 1969, to the final splashdown\nof Apollo\n17 on December 17, 1972.\nBefore the Apollo Program, astronomical\nobservations provided an early picture of the details of the\nlunar surface. In those days, intelligent\nspeculation\nabout the origin and history of the Moon was greatly\ninhibited\nbecause the scientific data required about\nthe chemistry and about the internal condition of the\nplanet could not be furnished\neven by the most\npowerful\ntelescopes.\nSome of the most important\nscientific\nobservations\nconcerning\nthe nature of the\nMoon and existing prior to the manned\nare summarized below.\n\nlunar landings\n\nThe discovery of the physiographic\nfeatures of the\nMoon dates back to Galileo, who observed that the\nside of the Moon facing the Earth consisted\nof\nmountainous\nregions that he designated\nterra and\nsmoother\nregions that he designated mare, similar to\nterrestrial\ncontinents\nand oceans. He also observed a\nmarked\nregions\n\ndifference\nin reflectivity\nbetween these two\nof the Moon: the mare was much darker than\n\nthe terra. Further astronomic a1 studies added much\ndetail to Galileo\'s discovery,\nincluding rather fine\nfeatures such as the rilles. However, before Apollo,\nthe cause of these fundamental\nphysiographic\ndifferences was not well understood.\nLater, some scientists\nhypothesized\nthat the relatively smooth mare basins\nwere very extensive\n\nlava flows. Others\n\ntheorized\n\nthat\n\nINTRODUCTION\ntheywere\n\nextensive dust deposits, in fact, dust bowls.\nStill other scientists seriously suggested that the maria\nwere filled by a type of sedimentary\nrock that was\ndeposited at a very early stage in lunar history when\nthe Moon had an atmosphere.\nBefore\nman landed on the lunar surface, two\nexplanations\nfor the origin of the circular depressions\nor craters, the most common physiographic\nfeature\non the lunar surface, were continuously\ndebated: (1)\nthat the features of the craters, similar to calderas on\nEarth, were of volcanic origin, and (2) that the craters\nwere produced\nby projectiles\nimpacting\nthe lunar\nsurface, in the same way that meteorites occasionally\nexcavate craters on Earth. Now it is fully realized that\nthe surface of the Moon could be sculpted both by\nimpacts\nand by volcanic craters, but primarily\nby\nimpacts.\nDialogue on the activity of the Moon and on the\nrole of volcanism on the lunar surface developed into\nthree schools of thought on the thermal history of\nthe Moon. One school held that the Moon had been\nrelatively inactive and had undergone\nsome chemical\ndifferentiation\nonly very early in lunar history.\nAnother school propounded\nthat the history of the\nMoon was similar to the Earth\'s long and continuous\nrecord of volcanism and chemical differentiation,\nand\nthat lunar volcanoes were active in the recent past.\nOthers thought the Moon had undergone no volcanic\nactivity at all.\nThe chemical nature of the lunar surface, up to the\ntime of Surveyor V, was totally unknown.\nHowever,\nthere had been a number of suggestions. For example,\nit was suggested\nat one time that carbonaceous\nchondrites\nwere typical of the dark mare regions;\nothers suggested that meteorites\nknown as eucrites\nwere representative\nof the lunar surface; still others\nsuggested that silica-rich glass found in mysterious\nobjects called tektites\nmust represent\nparts of the\nlunar surface. One could not even be sure that these\nhypotheses were mutually exclusive.\nThe pre-Apollo data obtained by unmanned\nsatellites discovered\n(1) the mascons, which suggested a\nremarkedly\nrigid or strong lunar interior; (2) either a\nvery weak lunar magnetic field or no field whatever;\nand (3) a physiographic\ndifference between the lunar\nfar side and the near side, in that the dark mare\nregions were essentially\nabsent from the far side of\nthe Moon.\nAs we now look back on the six Apollo landings,\nwe are infinitely richer in facts concerning the Moon.\n\nxv\n\nSome of these facts and observations\nhave already\nbeen tentatively\nassembled in models that are leading\nto a much fuller understanding\nof lunar history.\nAlthough it is extremely\ndifficult to account for the\nremaining facts with a consistent explanation,\nmajor\nareas of understanding\ncan be briefly outlined.\nA rather definite and reliable time scale for the\nsequence of events of lunar history has been developed. It has been established with some confidence\nthat the filling of the mare basins largely took place\nbetween 3.2 and 3.8 billion years ago. This has been\ndemonstrated\nfrom\nanalysis\nof the mare basalts\nobtained from the Apollo 11, 12, 15, and 17 missions\nand Luna 16. Because these mare fillings represent a\nmajor physiographic\nfeature on the lunar surface, it\nhas been inferred that the time of formation of more\nthan 90 percent of the cratering on the Moon was 4\nbillion years ago or earlier. In comparison,\nthe ocean\nbasins of the Earth are younger than 300 million\nyears. (Terrestrial\nrocks older than 3 billion years are\nalmost\nunknown.)\nThe analysis\nof the highland\nmaterial collected\non the Apollo 14, 15, 16, and 17\nmissions and Luna 20 has shown the widespread\noccurrence of breccias with an apparent age of 3.8 to\n4.1 billion\nyears.\nThere is strong\ncircumstantial\nevidence that rocks dating back to 4.5 to 4.6 billion\nyears ago must exist within the Moon, although very\nfew of the Apollo rocks have crystallization\ndates\nlying between\n4.0 and 4.6 billion years. It now\nappears that heat from the intense bombardment\nof\nthe lunar surface by projectiles, ranging in size from\nmicroscopic\nto tens of kilometers\nin diameter,\nwas\neffective\nin resetting\nmost of the clocks used to\ndetermine the absolute age of the rocks.\nThe relative importance\nof volcanic and impactproduced\nfeatures on the lunar surface appears to be\nwell established\nwith the conclusion\nof the Apollo\nmissions.\nThere\nseems to be almost\nunanimous\nagreement\nthat the dark mare regions are underlain\nby extensive\nlava flows, shown\nboth by rocks\nreturned\nby the Apollo 11, 12, 15, and 17 missions\nand Luna 16 and by the high-resolution\nphotographs\nthat give convincing pictures of features comparable\nto terrestrial\nlava flows. Almost all craters appear to\nbe caused by impacting\nprojectiles,\nthus leaving the\nquestion\nof volcanic\nrocks in the terra regions\nunanswered.\nWith the conclusion of Apollo 17, it has\nbeen suggested that volcanic activity in the highland\nregion subsequent\nto approximately\n3 billion years\nago may be highly restricted or virtually nonexistent.\n\nxvi\n\nAPOLLO\n17PRELIMINARY\nSCIENCE\nREPORT\n\nApollo experiments\ninvestigating\nwhetherthe\nMoon "alive" r"dead"ndicate\nis\no\ni\nthat,compared\nto\nEarth,theMoon seismically However,\nis\nquiet.\nthere\naremanyverysmallquakes,\npossiblyriggeredy\nt\nb\ntides,at approximately krn belowthe lunar\n_800\nsurface. elow1000kin, the Moonis partially\nB\nmolten. quiet oon consistent\nA\nM is\nwiththeconclusionthat volcanism\nandothertypesof tectonic\nactivityhave\nbeenrareor absentromthe lunar\nf\nsurface the last 2 to 3 billion years. unar\nfor\nL\nseismology\nreveals\nthattheMoonhasa crustmore\nthan60kmthick. oth the precise origin of this crust\nB\nand the compositions\ncausing the discontinuity\nin\nseismic velocity are still subjects of debate. From the\nApollo Program, we can conclude that the Moon, at\none time, was very much alive and now is very quiet.\nThe overall magnetic field of the Moon has been\nfound to be negligible, as was thought\nbefore the\nApollo missions. However, the magnetometers\nplaced\non the lunar surface reveal surprisingly strong local\nfields, variable both in direction\nand in intensity.\nPaleomagnetic\nstudies have also determined\nthat mare\nlava flows crystallized\nin a magnetic field that was\nmuch stronger than that of the present Moon. These\ndiscoveries raise the possibility\nthat, during its early\nhistory, the Moon either was exposed to a relatively\nstrong interplanetary\nmagnetic field or had a magnetic field of its own that has since disappeared.\nThe interior structure\nof the Moon and its thermal\ncharacteristics\nhave been investigated\nthrough a careful study of the fluctuations\nof the magnetic field\ninduced by the solar wind, which reveals a relatively\nlow lunar electrical conductivity.\nThe conductivity\nof\nmost silicates is, to the first order, a function both of\ntemperature\nand of chemical\ncomposition\n(such as\nthe abundance\nof ferrous\nand ferric iron). With\npreliminary\nmeasurements\nfrom the Apollo 12, 15,\nand 16 missions and with fluctuation\nmeasurements\nof the magnetic field, lunar conductivity\ncan be\nderived. In conjunction\nwith various chemical models\nof the Moon, this conductivity\ncan be used to place\nconstraints\non the deep lunar interior temperatures,\nwhich are highly model dependent.\nThe thermal history of the Moon was investigated\non the Apollo 15 and 17 missions through measurements of the heat escaping from the Moon. These\nmeasurements\nindicate that the energy flux escaping\nfrom the Moon is approximately\nhalf that of the\nEarth.\nThis\nis surprisingly\nhigh, considering\nthe\nrelative size of the two planets. If these measurements\n\nprove to be characteristic\nof the Moon, perhaps the\nexplanation\nis that the Moon is richer than the Earth\nin the radioactive elements uranium and thorium and\nthat these elements are strongly concentrated\nin the\n_upper parts of the Moon:\nTwo current\ntheories\nof lunar evolution\nhave\nresulted from the consideration\nof information\nconcerning (1) the concentration\nand location of radioactive materials, (2) the inferred volcanic history of\nthe Moon, and (3) the inferred\nupper limits of\ninternal temperature.\nThe first hypothesis is that the\nplanet was chemically layered during its formation.\nThe low initial temperature\nof the lunar interior\n(below 500 km) gradually increased, perhaps reaching\nthe melting point during the last billion years, while\nthe initial hot temperature\nof the lunar exterior\ngradually decreased. Volcanism is entirely accounted\nfor by early melting in the outer 400 km of the\nMoon. The alternate\nmodel of thermal\nevolution\nassumes that the Moon, chemically\nhomogeneous\nduring its formation,\nunderwent\nextensive chemical\ndifferentiation\nthat resulted in surface concentrations\nof radioactivity\nvery shortly after its formation.\nIn\nother words, much of the Moon was molten at its\norigin. Of course, both of these theories will undergo\ndiscussion and revision in the coming years.\nThe most extensive and diverse data obtained on\nthe lunar surface are concerned\nwith the chemistry\nand mineralogy\nof the surface materials. The study of\nsamples from the six Apollo sites and the two Luna\nsites reveals a number\nof chemical\ncharacteristics.\nAlthough it is very early to generalize\nfrom these\nrelatively few samples of the whole lunar surface, two\norbital experiments\nprovide excellent\ndata regarding\nthe regional distribution\nof various rock types: the\nX-ray fluorescence\nexperiment\nand the gamma ray\nexperiment.\nThe X-ray fluorescence\nexperiment\ndefined\nthe\nprime difference between the chemistry of the mare\nand highland regions. The mare regions have aluminum concentrations\n2 to 3 times lower than those of\nthe terra or highland regions and magnesium concentrations 1.5 to 2 times greater than those of the terra\nregions. These differences in chemical concentrations\nthroughout\nthe equatorial\nregion of the Moon are\nconsistent with the chemical analysis of the returned\nsamples. When orbital data and lunar sample data are\ncombined,\nthey provide an excellent\nexplanation\nof\nthe morphological\nand albedo differences.\nFor example, all mare basalts\nhave been found\nto be\n\nINTRODUCTION\nunusually\nrichin ironand\nsometimes\nrichintitanium.\nThehighironconcentrations\nin themare,\nasopposed\nto thelowconcentrations\nin thehighlands,abasic\nis\nexplanation thealbedo\nof\ndifferences,\nbecause\nboth\nglass ndmineral\na\nsubstances ironand\nrichin\ntitanium\nareusually ery\nv dark.\nTheorbitalgammaayexperiment\nr\nresults how\ns\nthat the regionnorth and southof the crater\nCopernicus\nisremarkably radioactive\nrichin\nelements.\nA band\ngoingfromnorthof the FraMauro\nsiteto\nwestof the Apollo 15 site contains soil 20 times\nricher\nterra\nrock\n\nin uranium\n\nand thorium\n\nthan\n\neither\n\nmare\n\nor\n\nin other parts of the Moon.

The\ndifferences\nbetween lunar rocks and terrestrial rocks\nare so marked that the\ndifferent from the Earth.\n\nMoon\n\nmust\n\nbe chemically\n\nThe Moon appears to be much richer in elements\nthat form refractory\ncompounds\nat temperatures\nof\napproximately\n1600 to 1800 K. Many scientists are\nnow coming to the conclusion\nthat the chemistry of\nthe lunar surface reveals that some separation of solid\nmaterial and gas in the lunar dust cloud took place at\ntemperatures\nin excess\nof 1600\nK. The strong\ndepletion\nof elements\nthat are volatile\nat high\ntemperatures\nin the outer portion of the Moon is\nconsistent\nwith the enrichment\nof refractory\nelements.\nNone of the three\nthe Moon-separation\ncircumsolar\norbit,\n\ntheories\n\nregarding\n\nthe origin of\n\nfrom the Earth, capture from a\nor formation\nfrom a dust cloud\n\nsurrounding\nthe Earth-can\nbe absolutely eliminated\nby the present data. However, the chemical differences between the Earth and the Moon, the depletion\nof volatile elements, and the enrichment\nof refractory\nelements in lunar samples make it unlikely that the\nMoon was tom out of the Earth.\nIn summary,\nthe age of the Moon is well determined, and the Moon has a crust (the chemical\ncomposition\nof which is fairly well understood),\na\nmantle,\nand a partially\nmolten deep interior.\nThe\nunderstanding\nof the mascons is well underway. Facts\nsubstantiating\nthe early theories of the atmosphere\nhave been obtained. Basic questions that were asked 5\nyr ago, such as whether the Moon is hot or cold, alive\nor dead, or has craters formed by volcanism\nor\nimpact,\nare no longer\nasked. Apollo\ndata have\nchanged the types of questions\nasked. Post-Apollo\nquestions are more detailed, more specific, and more\n\nxvii\n\nsophisticated.\nYet, despite the great strides taken in\nknowledge about the Moon, its origin and formation\nare still unknown.\nA storehouse\n\nof resources\n\nhas been returned\n\nfrom\n\nthe Moon: almost 385 kg of lunar materials (obtained\nfrom six different landing sites on the near side of the\nMoon), 37 drive tubes, and 20 drill stems. To date,\nonly 10 percent\nof this lunar material has been\nexamined\nin detail. Approximately\n33 000 lunar\nphotographs\nand 20 000 reels of tapes of geophysical\ndata have been collected.\nThus, in 4 yr of lunar\nexploration,\nour knowledge\nof lunar characteristics\nhas been substantially increased, and vast resources of\nscientific data have been collected that will lead to a\ndecade of data analysis.\nIn the past decade, there have been two revolutions in planetary\nscience studies. There has been a\nrevolution\nin the new global tectonics describing the\nmotions of continents\nand the generation\nand destruction of the sea floor. In its investigations\nof the\norigin, history,\nand formation\nof the Moon, the\nApollo Program has led to a revolution in providing\nthe first deep understanding\nof a planet other than\nthe Earth through\nthe development\nof new techniques of exploration,\ninvestigation,\nand analysis and\nthrough the integration\nof the scientific knowledge\ngained in interdisciplinary\nfields. The Apollo Program\nhas provided\nEarth scientists with 4 yr of anxiety,\nexcitement,\nand fulfillment. Apollo lessons may force\na reconsideration\nof many of the techniques\nand\nmodels that are currently\nused in understanding\nthe\nearly history of the Earth. As we look to future\ngenerations,\nhopefully,\nwe have developed a scientific\nprogram\nthat carried out worthy\nand substantial\npreliminary\nfoundation\n\ninvestigations\nand that laid a very firm\nfor future scientific inquiry. In decades to\n\ncome, the analysis of Apollo data may indeed lead to\na polar orbital flight around the Moon or to a lunar\nbase where men may explore the entire surface of the\nMoon. By studying the Moon, we can better understand processes of planetary accretion, evolution, and\ncomposition\nso that lunar studies have implications\nthat extend beyond the Moon. Hopefully, our generation has performed a job that history will recognize as\na commendable\nscientific endeavor, a contribution\nof\nvaluable information-useful,\nmeaningful, and inspirational.\nAnthony J. Calio\nNASA L yndon B. Johnson\n\nSpace Center\n\nI. Apollo 1 Site Selection\n7\nN. W.Hinnersa\nT\n\n>\n\nConsideration of an Apollo 17 landing site began\nin earnest during debate over the Apollo 16 site,\nprimarily because the Apollo Site Selection Board\n(ASSB) desired to consider Apollo 1\xe2\x80\x996and 17, the last\nlunar missions, as a complementary pair. Therefore,\nin order to put the Apollo .17 site selection in\ncontext, it is necessary to discuss highlights of the\nApollo 16 site selection as well. (For more details\nabout the Apollo 16 site selection, see ref. 1-1.) Some\nof the content of this report is abstracted or\nparaphrased from the minutes of the ASSB meetings\n(written by the author) or from other unpublished\ndocuments (also written by the author) used as\nbackground material for or documentation of several\nmeetings of an Ad Hoc Site Evaluation Committee.\nAll that material is available on request.\n\n.\n\nDesci&pH and Alphonsus emerged as the prime\nhighland contenders for the Apollo 16 site. It was\nassumed that one of these two candidates would be\nchosen for the Apollo 16 site and that the Apollo 17\nsite would be chosen ffom another candidate list. The\nApollo 17 candidate sites under consideration at that\ntime are discussed, in priority order, in the following\nparagraphs.\n\nTycho and Davy Crater Chain\nNo relative priority *as established for Tycho and\nthe Davy Crater chain. The objectives of a Tycho\nmission emphasized the southth highlands samples\nand impact phenomena.\nA mission to the Davy Crater chain had the same\ngeneral objectives as an Alphonsus mission, namely\nthe sampling of highlands, upland basin fill (Cayley\nFormation), and rocks of \xe2\x80\x9cdeep-seated\xe2\x80\x9d origin. The\nsite differs, however, in that (1) the Cayley is not\nmodified by rilles and other volcanic features peculiar\nto Alphonsus, (2) the putative deep-seated material\nwould be sampled at a crater chain instead of at a\ndark-halo crater, and (3) the highlands region (presumably pre-Imbrian) was not considered as apt to be\nmantled by the Cayley \xe2\x80\x9cvolcanic\xe2\x80\x9d material as that at\nAlphonsus. (At that time, there was no knowledge of\nthe brecciated nature of the Cayley Formation as\nsampled at Descartes.) It was noted that adequate\nphotographs of Davy did not exist and would have to\nbe obtained on an Apollo 16 mission to Descartes.\n\nP ~ E - A P O L L O SITE\n16\nSELECTION STATUS\nAt the time of the Apollo 16 site evaluation, soon\nafter the Apollo 14 flight, there was a clear consensus\namong the lunar science community that both the\nApollo 16 and 17 missions should be targeted to\nhighlands sites. The Apollo 15 mission had not been\nflown, but the mare region adjacent to Rima Hadley\nand Montes >Apenninus had been selected as the\nApollo 1 5 site. Only minor support existed for\nanother mare mission, and it was mainly limited to\nthe Marius Hills. That candidate site, however, became largely acadeinic when a revised launch schedule\nresulted in the Marius Hills being operationally\ninaccessible, or only marginally accessible, for either\nthe Apollo 16 or 17 time frame.\nAfter imposition of the operational constraints,\nmainly accessibility and available photographic coverage, and after consideration of the scientific return,\n\nSouthwest of Mare Crisium and\nthe \xe2\x80\x9dCentral Highlands\xe2\x80\x9c\n\naNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, D.C.\n\nNo relative priority was established for a site\nsouthwest of Mare Crisium and the \xe2\x80\x9ccentral highlands.\xe2\x80\x9d The Apollo 15 mission was scheduled to\noverfly an extensive highlands region southwest of\nj\xe2\x80\x98\n\n1-1\n\n1-2\n\nAPOLLO\n\nMare\n\nCrisium.\n\nIt\n\nwas\n\nbelieved\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nthat\n\nresults\n\nfrom\n\nApollo 15 X-ray and gamma ray spectrometers\nwould\nenable\ndetermination\nof whether\ngross chemical\ndifferences\nexist between\nthe Crisium and HadleyApenninus\nregions.\nAn affirmative\nanswer would\nincrease the priority of the Crisium areas.\nThe central\nhighlands\nbetween\nDescartes\nand\nAlphonsus were considered because they are expected\nto contain pre-Imbrian\nmaterials. As was true for\nDavy, a prerequisite\nto selection was acquisition\nof\ngood photographs\nof the region on the Apollo 16\nmission. It was recognized that a potential\nproblem\nexisted\nin using Apollo\n16 photographs\nof either\nDavy or the central\nhighlands\nfor an Apollo\n17\nmission, but it was believed that the increased interval\nbetween flights, changed from 6 to 9 months, would\nmake the turnaround possible.\n\nGassendi\n\nt\n\nA flight to Gassendi was viewed as a central-peaks\nmission with Copernicus-type\nobjectives of sampling\nhigl_ands materials (of impact-rebound\norigin) and of\ninvestigating\nimpact\nphenomena.\nA mission\nto\nGassendi had the additional\nobjective of investigation\nof the crater floor, which exhibits features interpreted to result from isostatic rebound; also, the site\nis distant from Mare Imbrium.\n\nCopernicus\nThe\n\nCopernicus\n\nCentral\n\ncentral-peaks\n\nPeaks\nsite,\n\npreviously\n\nof\n\nhigh pri\'ity , was greatly reduced in priority for the\nApollo |\' mission (as it had been for the Apollo 16\nmission) because Copernicus\nray material had probably been sampled on the Apollo 12 mission and\nbecause there were already three sites (Apollo 12, 14,\nand 15) in the circum-Imbrium\nregion of the Moon.\nA far-side site-most\nnotably in Tsiolkovsky-was\nalso briefly considered. Although it was shown to be\npossible, at first look, to support the mission by using\na communications\nrelay satellite beyond the Moon, it\nwas believed that the time schedule for the mission\npreparation\nwas too short and that the probability of\na successful mission was less than that for a conventional near-side site.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nfor the Apollo 17 mission. At the meeting, the ASSB\nrecognized\nboth Descartes and Alphonsus\nas good\nsites. Descartes was selected as the Apollo 16 site,\nmainly for two reasons. First, more was known about\nthe operational\naspects of a Descartes mission because, in contrast\nto the only recently\nconsidered\nAlphonsus,\nDescartes had been a high-priority\ncandidate site since before the Apollo 12 mission. Second,\nthe Descartes prime objectives (sampling the Cayley\nand Descartes\nFormations)\nwere independent\nof\nApollo\n14 and 15 results whereas an Alphonsus\nmission had a common objective with the Apollo 15\nmission of "old highlands" sampling.\nAt the\nsame meeting,\nthe ASSB designated\nAlphonsus as the prime candidate site for the Apollo\n17 mission. (Alternatively,\nDescartes would have been\ndesignated had it not been selected as the Apollo 16\nsite.) Alphonsus\nwas designated\npartly because the\nscientific\narguments\nthat had made Alphonsus\na\nprime candidate\nfor the Apollo 16 site had convinced\nthe ASSB of the validity of the Alphonsus objectives.\nMore to the point, however, Alphonsus was known to\nbe operationally\nacceptable\nwhereas all other Apollo\n17 candidate\nsites had actual or potential\nproblems.\nFirst, Tycho was deleted from further consideration\nbecause of concern about the rough terrain surrounding the landing ellipse. Second, the central highlands\nand the Davy Crater chain were questionable\nbecause\nof the necessity\nto rely on Apollo 16 photographs\n(i.e., insufficient\ntime to create operational\nmaps,\nmodels, etc.). Third, Gassendi,\nalthough\nnot fully\nanalyzed, appeared to be dominated by rough terrain.\nFourth, the Copernicus\ncentral peaks appeared to be\nlosing scientific interest. Finally, one could not count\non Apollo 15 successfully\nphotographing\na suitable\nsite in the region southwest of Mare Crisium; that is, a\nsite that was operationally\nacceptable\nand at least of\nequal scientific interest as Alphonsus. This, then, was\nthe situation until after the flight of Apollo 15, on\nwhich were obtained both excellent photographs\nof\nthe highlands between Mare Crisium and Mare Serenitatis and good X-ray and gamma ray data for\nextensive\nregions along the groundtrack.\nThe next\ntask was to determine if suitable sites could be found\nin this region.\n\nPOST-APOLLO\nAPOLLO\nOn\nApollo\n\nJune\n\n16 SITE\n\nSELECTION\n\n3, 1971,\n\nthe\n\nto select\n\n15 ACTIVITIES\n\nMEETING\n\nASSB met\n\n16 site and to designate\n\na prime candidate\n\nthe\nsite\n\nThe preliminary Apollo 15 gamma ray and X-ray\nspectrometer\nresults\nindicated\nthat the highlands\nregion southwest of Mare Crisium is generally low in\n\nAPOLLO\n17SITE\nSELECTION\nradioactivity\nand has a high aluminum-to-silicon\nratio,\nboth thought\nto indicate an anorthositic\nhighlands\ncrust different\nfrom that of the Montes Apenninus\nregion.

The highland site southwest of Crisium is in the\nhighland terrain unit accessible to a Russian unmanned sample return spacecraft. (Luna 20 subsequently\nlanded\nin that region.) Additionally,\nthe site is\nrelatively homogeneous\nand thus would not make\nefficient use of the Apollo sampling system.\n2.

The putative "young" materials are generally\ndark and often associated\nwith\ncone-type structures\nor dark-halo craters thought to\nbe indicative\nof explosive volcanism. The explosive\nnature itself was judged significant for two reasons.\n1.

On the one hand, there was a desire to\nmaximize the amount\nof new photography,\nwhich\nmeant\nfavoring sites the orbital\ngroundtracks\nof\nwhich least duplicated those of Apollo 15 and 16. On\nthe other hand, it was argued that some of the new\norbital experiments\non Apollo 17 (infrared\nradiometer and lunar sounder)\nwould benefit most by\ngroundtracks\ncovering both the largest variety of\nfeatures\nand the largest area (high-latitude\nsites).\nThere was thought to be additional merit in flying the\ninfrared\nradiometer\nand the lunar sounder\nover\n\nTraverse\n\nmainly from the absence\n\nexperiments\nof previous missions (e.g.,\npassive seismometer,\nmagnetometer,\nand laser ranging\nretroreflector).\n\nform.\n\nOrbital\n\nresulted\n\nin the Apollo\n\n17\n\nsimilaro Hadley-Apenninus.\nt\nYoung volcanics are not in evidence at Gassendi,\nand a strong argument could not be made regarding\nthe relative value of the dark-halo craters at Alphonsus to the dark mantling blanket at Taurus-Littrow.\nBoth regions were hypothesized\nto contain possible\nxenoliths\nor lavas (or both)\nfrom deep interior\nregions.\nThe orbital science coverage arguments were not\ncompelling.\nIt was recognized that a Gassendi mission\nwould result in the least duplication\nof Apollo 15 and\n16 photography\nand would have the positive attribute\nof flying over the Orientale\nBasin in sunlight. However, more weight was given to the argument that the\ninfrared\nradiometer\nand the lunar sounder could\nbenefit\n\nmore\n\nby\n\nthe\n\nTaurus-Littrow\n\ngroundtracks\n\nbecause of the greater variety of overflown\nThe Ad Hoc Site Evaluation Committee\nthat\n\nthe\n\nTaurus-Littrow\n\ntargets.\nconcluded\n\nsite was the best candidate,\n\nAPOLLO\n17SITE\nSELECTION\nfollowed by Gassendi, with Alphonsus a weak third.\nThe overall result was based primarily\non the fact\nthat, in terms of sample acquisition,\nTaurus-Littrow\nwas a two-objective\nsite (highlands, young volcanics)\nwhereas Gassendi was a single-objective\nsite (centralpeak highlands).\nThe better\norbital\nphotography\ncoverage\nfor a Gassendi mission was not deemed\nequivalent\nto obtaining\na second prime sampling\nobjective.\nAlphonsus,\nalso a dual-objective\nsite, did\nnot measure up to Taurus-Littrow\nprimarily because\nof the uncertainty\nconcerning Cayley mantling of the\nAlphonsus crater wall and the superior orbital science\nfor Taurus-Littrow\ngroundtracks.\nThe ranking developed by the Ad Hoc Site Evaluation Committee,\nand\npresented\nto the ASSB, was consistent\nwith that\nobtained by summarizing\nthe 32 responses to the Site\nEvaluation Document.\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 SITE\n\nSELECTION\n\nThe ASSB met on February\nApollo 17 site. The scientific\n\nMEETING\n\n11, 1972, to select the\narguments and recom-\n\nmendations\ndiscussed in the previous subsection were\npresented,\nfollowed by a presentation\nof the operational considerations,\nof which only selected highlights are discussed in this report.\nOf the three candidate\nsites analyzed in detail,\nGassendi presented the most problems. Although the\nterrain along the landing approach\nwas acceptable,\nthe landing area itself presented\nproblems.\nOutside\nthe nominal 30 landing ellipse, which was acceptably\nsmooth,\nthe terrain is heavily cratered,\nrolling, or\ncontains rilles. If the lunar module were to land down\nrange of the nominal ellipse, it was likely that, even if\nthe landing were successful, the crewmen would not\nbe able to traverse\npeaks), particularly\n\nto the prime objective (the central\nif there were a failure of the lunar\n\nroving vehicle (LRV). These problems were deemed\nsufficient that the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space\nCenter (JSC) considered\nApollo 17 site.\n\nGassendi\n\nunacceptable\n\nas an\n\nAt Alphonsus,\nboth the approach terrain and the\nlanding area were judged "highly acceptable,"\nwhich\nwas the status when Alphonsus was being considered\nfor the Apollo 16 site. It was also determined\nthat in\nthe contingency\nsituation of a walking mission (LRV\nfailure), the crewmen could reach both the crater wall\nand the dark-halo crater material.\n\n1-5\n\nAlthough early analysis of the Taurus-Littrow\nsite,\nperformed just after the screening of the Apollo 15\nphotographs,\nhad indicated that no serious problems\nwere associated with the site, detailed plotting of the\nlanding ellipse in the valley showed that with a 90 \xc2\xb0\nazimuth for the approach path and with a constraint\nto avoid the sudden rise in topography\ncaused by the\nscarp, the fit of the ellipse in the valley became very\ntight. Because of the increased precision\navailable\nfrom the Apollo 15 metric camera, however, it was\nshown that even without command module landmark\ntracking, the ellipse could be placed such that no\nlanding problem\nwould be caused by topography.\n(The westernmost\npart of the ellipse did include a\nsmall portion of the landslide, but it was well within\nthe capability of the crew to redesignate\nout of that\narea should they be heading toward it.) In addition,\nas in the case of Alphonsus,\nit was determined\nthat\nthe prime objective at Taurus-Littrow\nwas achievable\non a walking mission (LRV failure), even if the\nlanding were made outside the nominal ellipse.\nThe ASSB accepted\nthe JSC evaluation\nthat\nGassendi was operationally\nunacceptable\nand then\nfocused on Alphonsus\nand Taurus-Littrow.\nIt was\nfirst noted that, although\nboth Alphonsus\nand Taurus-Littrow were operationally\nacceptable,\nAlphonsus\npresented fewer risks. The risks were not related to\nsafety but to mission success. The differences\nin\nprobability\nof success were not quantifiable;\nthat is,\nshades of gray rather than blacks and whites were\ninvolved. Because there were no strong operational\ndiscriminators,\nthe discussion returned\nto the scientific attributes\nof the sites. A recapitulation\nthat the scientific evaluation clearly favored\n\nshowed\nTaurus-\n\nLittrow over Alphonsus;\nthe decisive factors were the\ncertainty of acquiring highlands material at TaurusLittrow\n(remembering\nthe possible\nmantling\nby\nCayley materials of the highlands at Alphonsus),\nthe\nsuperior orbital coverage, and the better use of LRV\ncapabilities.\nThe ASSB unanimously\naccepted\nthat\nevaluation\nand recommended\nto the Associate Administrator\nfor Manned SpaceFlight\nLittrow be the Apollo 17 landing site.\n\nthat\n\nTaurus-\n\nREFERENCE\n1-1.

Approximately 15 min\nlater, the CSM docked with the LM. After CSM/LM\nextraction from the SIVB, the SIVB was targeted for\nlunar impact, which occurred on December 10 at\n20:32:43 G.m.t. The impact location was approximately 84 n. mi. northwest of the planned target\npoint, and the event was recorded by the passive\n\nseismic experiments deployed on the Apollo 12, 14,\n15, and 16 missions.\nOnly one of the four planned midcourse corrections was required during translunar coast. A midcourse correction WCC) made at 17:03:00 G.m.t. on\nDecember 8 was a 1.6-sec service propulsion system\nburn resulting in a 10.5-ft/sec velocity change.

The second demonstration\nwas begun 2 hr 20 min\nlater. The SIM bay door was jettisoned at 15:05:40\nG.m.t. on December 10.\nLunar orbit insertion,\n\nexecuted\n\nat 19:47:23\n\nG.m.t.\n\non December 1O, placed the spacecraft into a lunar\norbit of 170.0 by 52.6 n. mi. Approximately\n4 hr 20\nmin later, the orbit was reduced to 59 by 15 n. mi.\nThe spacecraft remained\nin this low orbit for more\nthan 18 hr, during which time the CSM/LM undocking and separation were performed. The CSM circularization maneuver, which was performed at 18:50:29\nG.m.t. on December 11, placed the CSM into a 70.3by 54.3-n. mi. orbit.\nAt 14:35:00\nG.m.t. on December\n11, the CDR\nand the LMP entered the LM to prepare for descent\nto the lunar surface. The LM was powered up and all\nsystems\nwere nominal.\nA maneuver\nat 18:55:42\nG.m.t. on December\n11 placed the LM in an orbit\nwith a perilune altitude of 6.2 n. mi. Approximately\n47 min later, the powered descent to the surface\nbegan.\n\nLUNAR\n\nSURFACE\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nFollowing a nominal descent sequence, the spacecraft landed at 19:54:57\nG.m.t. on December 11 in a\nvalley at Taurus-Littrow,\nless than 200 m from the\npreferred\nlanding point. The best estimate\nof the\nlunar surface landing position is latitude\n20c10 \' N\nand longitude 30046 \' E (ref. 2-1). The Apollo 17\nlanding site in relation to those of all previous lunar\nlanding missions is shown in figure 2-2.\nThe first lunar surface EVA began at 23:54:49\nG.m.t. on December 11, with the CDR egressing at\n00:01:00\nG.m.t. on December\n12. Television coverage began after installation\nof the ground-commanded\ntelevision camera and the high-gain antenna on the\nLRV. The first television pictures were received at\n01:10:49\nG.m.t. Before\nleaving the LM for the\nALSEP\nsite, the crew deployed\nthe cosmic ray\nexperiment.\nThe site selected for the ALSEP was\napproximately\n185 m west-northwest\nof the LM.\nDeployment\nof the heat flow experiment\nwas nominal, with both probes inserted to a depth of 2.54 m.\nThe LEAM experiment\nand the LSG were also\ndeployed nominally. Preliminary operations\nwith the\ngravimeter did not indicate the beam-nulling problem\nthat was later encountered.\nThe ALSEP group was\n\ncompleted\nwith deployment\nof the LACE and the\nLSP experiment\n(except for explosive charges). Total\nALSEP deployment,\nwith relative locations\nof the\nexperiments,\nis shown in figure 2-3. The deep core\nsample was taken concurrently\nwith ALSEP deployment. Although difficulty was experienced\nin extraction, all three\ncore sections\nwere obtained.\nThe\nneutron flux probe was then deployed to full depth\nin the deep core hole. Both the receiver and transmitter\nof the SEP experiment\nwere deployed\nas\nplanned, with initial instrument\noperation scheduled\nduring EVA-2.\nDuring ALSEP deployment,\nextra time was required to level the central station and the antenna\ngimbal. The resulting time-line deficit was compensated for by relocating the first traverse station to an\narea near the rim of Steno Crater. At station 1A, the\ncrew collected\ngeological samples, including a rake\nsample, and took a traverse gravimeter\nreading. A\ntotal of six gravity measurements\nand one gravimeter\nbias measurement\nwere taken during\nEVA-1. At\nstation I A, the crew also deployed a 1-1b explosive\npackage for the LSP instrument.\nDuring their return\nto the LM, the crew deployed\na \xc2\xbd-1b explosive\npackage. The first ALSEP data were recorded\nat\n02:54:00\nG.m.t. on December\n12. The first EVA,\nwhich was 7 hr 12 min long, was completed\nat\n07:06:42 G.m.t. on December 12.\n\n/\'"\n,\'" .\n\ngeophone\n\'\nmodule\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 [{rill \'\'_\nGeophone casings\n2\n-.,.and\n\n.,,_\n_ Geophone\nGeophone\n3\nGeophone\n1\nRIG\n\nLACE\n\nFIGURE 2-3.-Deployment of the Apollo 17 ALSEP, showing the relative locations of the central station, radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), and the five\nexperiments.\n\nMISSIONESCRIPTION\nD\nThesecond\nEVAwas\nbegunt23:28:06 .m.t.\na\nG\non\nDecember The second major sampling stop of the\n12.\nmission was made early in EVA-2 at Nansen Crater,\nwhere the crew sampled primarily the rock debris at\nthe base of the South Massif. After leaving Nansen\nCrater, the crew made an unscheduled\nstop (station\n2A) to check the gravity gradient between the South\nMassif and the valley. The major geological objective\nof the third sampling site near Lara Crater was the\nscarp that runs north-south\nbetween the massif units.\nActivities at this stop included an exploratory\ntrench\nand a core sample, which was stored in the core\nsample vacuum container.\nTraverse station 4 was at\nShorty Crater, a 110-m dark-halo crater. Sampling at\nthis location was focused on deposits and rocks at the\ncrater rim. A trench dug in the crater rim exposed the\nmuch-discussed\norange soil. A double core sample was\nalso obtained\nat station 4. Blocks of subfloor basalt\nwere found\nat Camelot\nCrater\n(station\n5), and\nsampling included a search for dark mantle material.\nDuring the traverse on EVA-2, the SEP experiment\nwas operated\nand the crew deployed\n1/8-, 6-, and\n1/4-1b explosive\ncharges. Seven traverse gravimeter\nmeasurements\nwere taken: one each at stations 2, 3,\n4, and 5; one between\nstations 2 and 3; and two at\nthe LM site. Finally, eight LRV sampling stops were\nmade at points intermediate\nto the major stops to\nincrease the areal density of geological sampling sites.\nDuring the second EVA, it was discovered\nthat the\nsensor beam of the LSG could not be nulled, even\nthough the LMP reverified that the instrument\nwas\nlevel and the gimbal was free. The second EVA was 7\nhr 37 min long and ended at 07:05:02\nG.m.t. on\nDecember 13.\nThe third EVA began at 22:25:48\nG.m.t. on\nDecember\n13. The cosmic ray detector was recovered\nearly in the EVA to avoid exposure to an excess of\nlow-energy solar protons. The first two traverse stops\n(stations 6 and 7) of EVA-3 were made at the base of\nthe North Massif. Geological activities in these areas\nemphasized\nboulders and boulder tracks and included\nthe dark mantle material and the massif/valley\ninterface. A rake sample and a single core sample were\nobtained\nat station 6, and several rock chips were\ncollected from a 3-m boulder at station 7. At station\n8 (Sculptured\nHills), samples included\nthe dark\nmantle plains material. The crew obtained a trench\nsample and a rake sample at this location as part of\nthe sampling plan to look for differences between the\nSculptured\nHills and the Massifs. Sampling at station\n\n9 (Van Serg Crater)\n\n2-5\nwas concentrated\n\non the crest of\n\nthe crater rim and the ejecta blanket southeastward\nof the rim, at both\nof which were found soft,\ndark-matrix\nbreccias.\nA\ndouble core were obtained\nwas deleted\n\nto obtain\n\nfinal trench\nsample and\nat this station. Station 10\n\nadditional\n\ncloseout\n\ntime for\n\ncompletion\nof ALSEP photography\nand for further\nattempts to resolve the gravimeter problem.\nDuring EVA-3, four LRV sampling stops were\nmade and traverse gravimeter\nmeasurements\nwere\ntaken at stations 6, 8, and 9 and at the LM. The\nremaining two explosive packages for the LSP experiment were also deployed.\nLate in EVA-3, the LMP\nmade a last, unsuccessful\nattempt to null the sensor\nbeam of the LSG. One of the final science activities in\nthe EVA was retrieval of the neutron flux probe from\nthe deep drill core hole. The third EVA ended at\n05:40:56 G.m.t. on December 14.\nThe LM ascent\nstage lifted off the Moon at\n22:54:37 G.m.t. on December 14. Lift-off and ascent\nwere recorded\n\nby the ground-commanded\n\ntelevision\n\nassembly on the LRV. After a vernier adjustment\nmaneuver, the ascent stage was inserted into a 48.5by 9.4-n. mi. orbit. The LM terminal phase initiation\nburn was made at 23:48:58\nG.m.t. on December 14.\nThis 3.2-sec maneuver raised the ascent stage orbit to\n64.7 by 48.5 n. mi.

On revolution 49, the\ncamera was operated from the retracted position,\nthus losing stellar camera coverage on this sequence.\nThe laser altimeter operated well throughout the\nmission, obtaining 3769 ranging measurements. A\n30-min altimeter sequence scheduled for revolution\n62 was deleted to allow a special attitude sequence\nfor the far U V spectrometer. During the final sleep\n\nperiod in lunar orbit, the altimeter was operated to\nobtain 10 hr of continuous data, in addition to the\nplanned coverage.\nPhotographc and visual observations from the CM\nwere made as scheduled, with the exception of the\nsecond of two solar corona sequences, which was\nomitted because of time-line and attitude constraints.\nThe zodiacal light was photographed three different\ntimes: once each in red light, blue light, and\n\n2-10\nplane-polarized\n\nAPOLLO\nwhite light.

Still other questions must await further\nexploration.\nThe basic objective of the Apollo 17 mission was\nto sample basin-rim highland material and adjacent\nmare material and investigate\nthe geological evolutionary relationship\nbetween these two major units.\nIn addition to achieving this general geological objective, it has also been possible to measure directly the\nthermal\nneutron\nflux in the regolith,\nto explore\ngeophysically\nthe subsurface\nstructure\nof the valley\nfloor, to determine\nthe constituents\nof the lunar\n\nlight mantle,\nthe dark mantle,\nSculptured Hills, and the massifs.\nThe light mantle\n2A, and\nsampling\n\nFIELD\n\n3 and\nstops.\n\nunit\n\nthe\n\nwas sampled\n\nsubfloor,\nat stations\n\nthe\n2,\n\nat two lunar roving vehicle (LRV)\nPreliminary\nindications\nfrom these\n\nsamples are that the light mantle is primarily finegrained debris that includes cataclasites and breccias\nsimilar to those attributed\nto the South Massif and\ndifferent from the regolith elsewhere on the valley\nfloor. These observations\nare in agreement with the\nhypothesis that the light mantle unit resulted from a\nslide down the northern face of the South Massif that\noccurred approximately\n10 8 yr ago as indicated by\ncrater counts. The slide perhaps was caused by the\nimpact of some secondary ejecta at the top of the\nSouth Massif.\nThe dark mantle unit remains one of the enigmas\nof the Apollo 17 mission. Photogeological\nobservations of the subdued appearance\nof the larger craters\nand the general paucity of craters on the valley floor\nhad led to the expectation\nof a "mantling"\nunit\nwhich covered the valley floor sometime after most\nof the regolith formation\nhad taken place and which\nwas perhaps Copernican\nin age. Because of dark areas\nin depressions\nin the surrounding\nhighlands,\nthe\nmantling unit was expected\nto have also covered at\nleast part of the highlands. No such unit has so far\nbeen detected\nin situ. Instead, everywhere\non the\nValley floor except in the area of the light mantle, the\nsoil appears to be regolith largely derived from the\nunderlying\nsubfloor\nbasalt unit. A possible dark\nmantle component\nin the regolith is the dark glass\nsphere unit of unknown origin but possibly related to\nthe orange glass of station 4. The age of the dark\nglass, however, is 3.7 \xc3\x97 10 9 yr, and it is apparently\nwell mixed into the regolith, which seems to rule it\nout as the mantling unit.\nThe subfloor unit was well sampled at a number of\nstations (the Apollo lunar surface experiments\npackage (ALSEP) site and stations 1A, 4, 5, and 9?) and\n\natmosphere\nand observe their variations during the\nlunar day and night, and to explore even more of the\nlunar surface remotely from orbit.\nThese initial results and others will someday be\ncombined into a coherent picture of the evolution of\nthe Moon that will reflect more light on both the\nabstract and specific problems of the evolution and\ncurrent\nconditions\nof the Earth and other planets.\nThat will be the true legacy of the Apollo Programnot just the sometimes\napparently\nfragmented\npreliminary results seen here.\n\nLUNAR\n\nResults\n\nGEOLOGY\n\nPremission\nphotogeology\nof the Taurus-Littrow\nvalley and its environs led to the expectation\nof\nsampling five different major stratigraphic\nunits: the\n\naNASA Lyndon B.

At four other stations either at or very\nnear the massifs (stations\n2, 2A, 6, and 8), the\nBouguer anomaly increases rapidly to between -20\nand -25 mgal.

Both Apollo 17 probes were successfully inserted to their full depth of 2.36 m.\nPreliminary\nresults indicate that the heat flow at\nthe Apollo 17 site is 2.8 \xc3\x97 10-6 W/cm 2 for the first\nprobe and 2.5 X 10-6 W/cm\n2\nfor the second probe.\n\nSUMMARY\nOFSCIENTIFIC\nRESULTS\nThesealues\nv\ncanbecompared\nwitharevised for\nvalue\nthe Apollo 15 site of 3.1\xc3\x97 10-6\nThe\nW/cm\n\nuncertainty\n\nfor all three\n\n2.\n\nvalues is +- 20 percent.\n\nThe\n\nheat flow gradient for probe 1 is uniform in agreement with a similar observation made at the Apollo\n15 site. For probe\n2, however,\nthe gradient\nis\ndefinitely not uniform and the difference is believed\nto be due to insertion of the probe very near a buried\nboulder.\nCorrections\nfor topography\nhave not yet been\napplied to the heat flow values. Although the size of\nthese corrections\nis not clear at this time, it would\nappear that they will result in a reduction\nof the\npresent values by a factor of 15 to 25 percent for the\nApollo 17 measurements\nand an uncertainty\nof-+ 10\npercent for the Apollo 15 measurements.\nThe possible resulting difference between the heat flow values\nmeasured at the two different sites may be explainable in terms of higher thorium abundances,\nobserved\nby the Apollo 15 gamma ray instrument,\nin southeastern Mare Imbrium as compared with southeastern\nMare Serenitatis.\nIn any case, values of the heat flow\nbetween\n2.4 X 10 -6\nand 3.0X 10 -6 W/cm 2 are\nconfirmed\nas characteristic\nof more than one site of\nthe Moon. If applied generally to the entire Moon,\nthose values argue for relatively large quantities of\nradioisotopes\nin the outer layers of the Moon.\n\nLUNAR\n\nNEUTRON\n\nPROBE\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nTime-integrated\nfluxes of thermal neutrons (_ 1\neV) as a function\nof depth in the regolith were\nmeasured\nusing the lunar neutron\nprobe.

Therefore,\nthe problem\nconcerning\nthe fact that integrated\nneutron\ndosages\nfor soil samples indicate\nmore rapid and/or deeper\nregolith turnover than geological evidence indicates is\nnot resolved. Hence, neither the mixing depth nor the\ntime scale of the regolith model, both of which are\nneeded to fully interpret the gadolinium\nratios, has\nbeen defined.\n\nPASSIVE\n\n3-5\n\nSEISMIC\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nA passive seismometer\nstation was not included in\nthe Apollo 17 ALSEP. The impacts of the Apollo 17\nLM and SIVB were observed by the four stations\nalready in place at distances as great as 1750 km.\nThese impacts and the occurrence\nof other natural\nevents since the Apollo 16 mission (especially\nan\nimpact on the far side near Mare Moscoviense)\nhave\nhelped to further\ndefine the lunar seismic model\nbelow the "crust" as being characterized\nby a thick,\nseismically\ninactive,\nrelatively\nhomogeneous\nlithosphere that encloses an asthenospheric\nzone of partial\nmelting. Moonquake\nactivity appears to be concentrated at the boundary between these two zones at a\ndepth of approximately\n1000 km. Evidence has also\nbeen found for the existence of two belts of seismic\nactivity as plotted\nby epicenter\nlocations.\nSeismic\nobservations to date cannot be used to either confirm\nor deny\ncore.\n\nthe\n\npossible\n\nCOSMIC\n\nexistence\n\nRAY\n\nof a small iron-rich\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nA new set of cosmic ray detectors was carried to\nthe surface of the Moon on the Apollo 17. mission.\nTwo sets of detectors\n(including mica, quartz, glass,\nplastic, and foil) were exposed, one set facing the Sun\nand one set in the shade facing away from the Sun.\nDuring the time that the detectors\nwere exposed, no\nsignificant\nsolar activity\noccurred.\nAlthough\nthe\nabsolute\nflux levels for the 0.02- to 1-MeV/amu\nenergy range were considerably\nlower than those for\nthe Apollo 16 mission, the shape of the spectrum is\nsimilar to that for the flare that occurred during the\nApollo 16 mission and indicates that proportionate\nnumbers of energetic particles are emitted by the Sun\neven during quiet periods. Heavy-element\nenrichment\nnoted during flares is also present during the quiet\nperiods.\nTracks were also noted in the detectors\nfacing away from the Sun.

Depth of subsurface exploration,\nin terms of\nfeatures defined by changes in the dielectric constant,\ndecreased with increasing frequency.\nThe Apollo lunar sounder was designed for three\nprimary modes of operation:\nsounding, profiling, and\nimaging. The sounding mode pertains to the detection\nand mapping of subsurface\nfeatures such as a probable 100-m-deep interface detected in western Mare\nSerenitatis.\nThe profiling and imaging modes, which\nare similar to conventional\nsurface return radars, can\nprovide quantitative\nmetric and topographic\ndata as\nwell as albedo measurements.\nPreliminary\nresults obtained\nby processing\nsmall selected portions\nof the data indicate\nuseful data were obtained.\n\nULTRAVIOLET\n\nsome\nthat\n\nSPECTROMETER\n\nThe ultraviolet spectrometer\nflown in the SIM bay\nof the Apollo 17 spacecraft\nwas a single-channel\nscanner\nhaving a 12 \xc2\xb0 by 20 \xc2\xb0 field of view and\ncovering a spectral range of 1180 to 1680 A (118 to\n168 nm). The entire spectral range was repetitively\nscanned every 12 sec. The primary objective of the\ninstrument\nwas to measure\nthe lunar atnrosphere\nusing resonance line scattering. No lunar atmospheric\nconstituents\nwere detected except for a short-lived (2\nto 4 hr) "cloud" just after the descent of the LM.\nAmong new lower limits that were established is one\nof _< 10 atolns/cm 3 for atomic\n\nhydrogen\n\nat the lunar\n\nsurface. This low value (at least 10 times lower than\npredicted\nfor a transient lunar atmosphere\nresulting\nfrom the solar wind) implies that during diffusion at\nthe lunar surface, hydrogen\nmolecules\nare formed.\nThe upper limits for hydrogen molecules\ncurrent\nobservations\nare not inconsistent\nidea.

This mapping\nwas accomplished\nby sweeping the 1\xc2\xb0 instantaneous\nfield of view in contiguous strips perpendicular\nto the\norbital groundtrack.\nThe spectral bandpass extended\nfrom 1.2 to 70/am.\nIn addition\nto a number of individual\nthermal\nanomalies,\npreliminary\nexamination\nof the data\nshows, among other things, a great concentration\nof\nnighttime\nthermal hot spots in the Oceanus Procellarum region, particularly\nin contrast to the relative\nsmoothness\nof nighttime scans of highland areas. The\nnighttime thermal picture of the far side of the Moon\nis relatively featureless compared to that of the near\nside.\nS-BAND\n\nTRANSPONDER\n\nThe general similarities\nof the Apollo 15 and 17\ngroundtracks\nallowed good comparisons\nto be made\nbetween\ngravity data obtained\non the two separate\nmissions. Agreement in many areas (e.g., over Mare\nCrisium) was good. The model for the Serenitatis\nmascon, however, was shown to be inadequate;\nthe\nApollo 17 observations\nwere 1.6 times larger than\nthose predicted for the Apollo 17 groundtrack\nby the\nApollo 15 model. Because the new Apollo 17 data\nincrease the areal coverage of Mare Serenitatis,\nit is\nobvious that an improved\nmodel can be expected.\nVery good areal coverage\nwas also obtained\nof\nGrimaldi\nCrater,\nand there is evidence\nthat this\nmascon has the largest mass distribution\nyet observed\nfor any mascon (approximately\n1000 kg/cm2).\nAn estimate\nderived from these observations\nfor\nthe value of lunar gravity at the landing site (162 722\nregal) compares very well with that obtained by the\nlunar traverse gravimeter (162 695 regal).\n\nSUMMARY\nOFSCIENTIFIC\nRESULTS\nBIOSTACK\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nThe Apollo 17 biostack experiment\n(biostack II)\nwas of very similar configuration\nto the Apollo 16\nbiostack experiment\n(biostack I). The total radiation\ndose received by biostack II was approximately\n15\npercent higher than that received by biostack I. The\nprimary difference between the two experiments was\nthe different set of species flown on the two missions.\n(Three of the four species flown on Apollo 16 were\nflown again on Apollo 17 as well as three other\nspecies.) Initial results, using organisms\nnot hit by\ncosmic rays, show that, as on the Apollo 16 mission,\nviability is apparently\nnot affected by other factors\nrelated to space flight. The Apollo 16 results showed\nmarkedly\ndifferent\nsensitivity\nto radiation\nbetween\ndifferent\nstrains of the same species. These aspects\nwill be further investigated\nas work is continued\non\nbiostacks I and II.\n\nBIOCORE\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nFive pocket mice were flown in a self-contained\nunit in the Apollo 17 command module to study the\neffects of cosmic rays on living tissues, especially the\nbrain.\nFour of the five mice survived\nthe trip.\nProcessing of the bodies of all five Apollo mice and of\na number of control mice is underway. Sectioning of\nthe brains has been delayed pending full analysis of\nthe cosmic ray tracks in the subscalp monitors.\nAn\naverage of 16 tracks/monitor\nwas found for the\nmonitors on the mice that survived the trip. Portions\nof the scalp of one Apollo mouse have been examined\nand found to contain\nsome lesions, but a direct\nrelationship\nbetween these lesions and cosmic ray hits\nwill have to await further analysis and comparison\nbetween locations in the scalp and in the monitors.\n\n3-7\n\nOther organs are also being examined,\nare yet available.\nVISUAL\n\nLIGHT\n\nbut no results\n\nPHENOMENON\n\nObservations\nof the light flash phenomenon\ncontinued during the Apollo 17 mission. As on Apollo\n16, the Apollo light flash moving emulsion detector\nwas worn by one crewman\nfor a 1-hr observing\nsession during translunar\ncoast. No results are yet\navailable on the time history\nof tracks in these\nemulsions. When available, these data should define\nthe particles responsible for the light flashes.\nSome statistical data are available now on observations made during the last four Apollo missions. In\nparticular, two items stand out. First, a relatively long\nperiod of time is required before the perception\nof\nthe first event compared to the time between events\nthereafter. This fact would indicate that dark adaptation is involved and that the events occur in the eye.\nSecond, the length of time before the observation of\nthe first event was longer during transearth coast than\nduring translunar\ncoast; also, the rate of observed\nevents, after the first one, was lower during transearth\ncoast than during translunar\ncoast. The cause of the\ngreatly reduced ability to see the light flashes during\ntransearth coast as opposed to translunar coast is not\nclear.\nORBITAL\nMore than\n\na score\n\nGEOLOGY\nof individual\n\nsurface and spatial features\nfar based on the Apollo 17\nand panoramic\nand metric\nscope of these investigations\nthe structure\nof individual\n\ninvestigations\n\nof\n\nhave been performed\nso\ncrew orbital observations\ncamera photographs.\nThe\nranges from studies of\ncraters to studies of the\n\nsequences of mare stratigraphy\nand mare ridges\nstudies of the solar corona and zodiacal light.\n\nto\n\n4. Photographic\n\nSummary\n\nM. C. McEwen a and Uel S. Clanton a\n\nThe photographic\nobjectives\nof the Apollo\n17\nmission were to provide precisely oriented mapping\ncamera photographs\nand high-resolution\npanoramic\ncamera photographs\nof the lunar surface, to support a\nwide variety\nof scientific\nand operational\nexperiments, and to document\noperational tasks on the\n\nintended\nprimarily\nfor well-lighted\ntargets but was\nused with a high degree of success for target strips\nthat extended\nalmost to the terminator.\nEarthshine\n\nlunar surface and in flight.\nLunar surface photographs\n\nseeing possible "flashes."\nCrew-option\nphotographs\ninclude the "flash" areas, lunar surface color bound-\n\nare primarily\n\nphotographs,\nvirtually for the first time on an Apollo\nmission, have provided usable imagery, including that\nof lunar surface areas where the crewmen reported\n\nof three\n\naries, areas with orange-colored\nstrata, flows, and\nother features of geologic interest.\nThe lunar surface groundtrack\nenvelope\nof the\nApollo 17 spacecraft is illustrated in section 2 of this\nreport (fig. 2-6). The orbital inclination\nwas approximately 20 \xc2\xb0 throughout\nthe first 47 lunar revolutions\nand was increased to slightly more than 23 \xc2\xb0 during\nrevolution\n48. The terminator\nadvanced 75 \xc2\xb0 across\n\ntypes: (1)operational\nphotographs,\nto document\nthe\ncondition,\nperformance,\norientation,\nor setting of\nequipment\nand\nthe effectiveness\nof procedures;\n(2) scientific documentation\nphotographs,\nto record\nsamples in their undisturbed\ncondition as well as their\nlocation, orientation, and detailed setting or to record\nfeatures\nor materials\nthat were not collected;\nand\n(3) panoramic\nviews,\nlocation\nof traverse\n\nto provide for the accurate\nstations\nand to provide the\n\nthe lunar surface while the Apollo 17 spacecraft was\nin orbit. A portion of the lunar far side that had not\nbeen illuminated\nduring the other J-series missions\n(Apollo 15 and 16) was in sunlight during the early\nrevolutions\nof the Apollo 17 spacecraft.\nThe panoramic and mapping\ncameras were used to photograph a part of this area centered along a line from\napproximately\nlatitude\n23 \xc2\xb0 S, longitude\n152 \xc2\xb0 W, to\nlatitude 17 \xc2\xb0 S, longitude\n180 \xc2\xb0 W. Electric Hasselblad\n(EL) 70-ram photographs\nof the same area complement the scientific instrument module (SIM) camera\n\ncapability\nto reconstruct\nthe geologic setting of the\nlanding site.\nOrbital\nphotographic\ntasks, other than mapping\ncamera and panoramic\ncamera operation, were for\nboth\noperational\nand scientific\npurposes.\nOrbital\nscience\nphotography\nplanned\nbefore\nthe mission\nincluded\n(1) areas of geologic\ninterest;\n(2) nearterminator\nareas, where details of relief are enhanced;\n(3) areas not covered by photography\nfrom other\nmissions; (4) areas in earthshine;\nand (5) low-lightlevel astronomical\nphenomena,\nsuch as the solar\ncorona\nand zodiacal\nlight. In addition,\nfilm was\nallotted for crew-option\nphotographs\nto be taken on\nthe basis of real-time observations.\nIn tables 4-I to 4-III, the Apollo 17 cameras and\nfilm types are listed, and a general description of the\ntasks for which each was used is provided.

The remainder are transearth\ncoast (TEC) views of the lunar\nsurface. The panoramic\ncamera image is 11.4 by\n114.8 cm and, at the 110-kin altitude approximated\nin the near-circular\norbit after revolution\n12, covers a\n\naNASA Lyndon B.

Approximately 1 hr after\nthe translunar injection (TLI) maneuver during the\ntranslunar coast (TLC) phase of the mission, the\ntransposition, docking, and extraction (TD&E)\nmaneuvers were executed.

These maneuvers were documented from the CM with both the\nHasselblad EL camera and the 16-mm data acquisition camera (DAC). The DAC was bracket mounted,\nand the views of the LM, SIVB, and Earth in this\nsequence are mirror images.\nDuring TLC, the crew provided extensive descriptions of the Earth surface and of cloud patterns, and\nthe view was repeatedly recorded with the DAC and\nthe Hasselblad camera. Approximately 4.5 hr before\nlunar orbit insertion, the door that provided protective cover to the instruments in the SIM bay was\njettisoned; its departure was photographed with the\nDAC. The hyperbolic trajectory of the SIM bay door\neventually carried it beyond the lunar sphere of\ninfluence. Figures 4-6 to 4-9 are TLC photographs.\n\nLUNAR ORBIT PHOTOGRAPHY\nPRECEDING LM TOUCHDOWN\nDuring the first revolution of the spacecraft about\nthe Moon, the lunar surface was in sunlight from\napproximately 151" W t o 29" E longitude. As the\nspacecraft crossed the lunar sunrise terminator, the\nHasselblad EL camera was used to photograph the\nTaurus-Littrow landing site (lat. 20.2" N , long. 30.8"\nE) at a very low Sun illumination angle.\nWhen the spacecraft passed into sunlight again,\nnear longitude 152" W, the panoramic and mapping\ncameras were switched on to photograph a lunar\nfar-side area where high-quality photographic coverage had not been available previously. To complement the SIM camera photographs, the Hasselblad EL\ncamera was used to document the area north of the\ngroundtrack from the vicinity of the crater Galois\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n4-6\n\n-\n\nDirection of lunar rotation\nApproximate rate 0.5 deglhr\n\n60W\n\n30W\n\n0\n\n-\n\n30 E\n\n60 E\n\nFIGURE 4-2.-Apollo 17 panoramic camera coverage.

The mapping camera was left in\noperation until the spacecraft passed above the\nnear-side terminator, near longitude 28" E. The\npanoramic camera, constrained to not more than 30\nmin continuous operation, was turned off near\nlongitude 144" E; it was operated again from longitude 122" to 95" E. The SIM cameras were not\noperated again until after the LM was on the lunar\nsurface.\nAlthough no additional orbital science photography was scheduled until after the LM landing on\nrevolution 13, a number of crew-option photographs\nwere exposed during the first several revolutions (figs.\n4-10 and 4-1 1). Areas of special interest on the near\nside and the far side were photographed using the\nHasselblad camera with color film or, in the case of\nnear-terminator areas, with high-speed blackand-white film. Separation of the CSM and the LM on\nrevolution 12 was documented with the Hasselblad\ncamera and the DAC from each spacecraft. The CSM\nDAC photographed a mirror image.\n\nFIGURE 4-1 1.-Earthrise. Shortly after the beginning of\nrevohtion 3, the gibbous Earth rising over the eastern\nlimb of the Moon was photographed from the CM. Part of\nthe LM ascent stage is visible in the right foreground.

Figure 4-17\nillustrates the intense activity of the three periods of\nextravehicular activity (EVA) at the site as it\nappeared from an LM window shortly before lift-off.\nReal-time observations of lunar surface activities were\nprovided scientists and engineers on Earth by the\ntelevision (TV) camera mounted on the lunar roving\nvehicle (LRV).\nThe lunar surface documentary photographs taken\nin the vicinity of the LM included the checkout drive\nof the LRV (fig. 4-18) and the traditional salute to\nthe flag (fig. 4-19) taken during EVA-1. Before\n\nEVA-2, the LMP was photographed with the equipment required for the EVA (fig. 4-20). The CDR also\ndocumented their repair of the LRV fender that was\nbroken during EVA-1 (fig. 4-21). A photograph of\nthe Earth above the LM (fig. 4-22) was taken shortly\nbefore EVA-2 closeout.\nThe deployment of the lunar surface experiment\nequipment was documented with 70-mm Hasselblad\nphotographs. Figures 4-23 to 4-27 show the Apollo\nlunar surface experiments package (ALSEP) site and\nseveral individual pieces of scientific equipment.\nSample documentation includes photographs of\nboulders from which samples were collected (figs.\n4-28 and 4-29) and photographs that illustrate the use\nof sampling tools (figs. 4-30 and 4-31).

On revolution 52,\nthe CSM maneuvered to an attitude that would\npermit inspection of the SIM bay from the LM, and\nboth spacecraft were photographed with the Hasselblad cameras (figs. 4-54 and 4-55). Much of the area\nsouth of the groundtrack from the eastern margin of\nMare Crisium to the crater Copernicus was also\ndocumented with an LM Hasselblad (fig. 4-56). The\nCM TV provided Earth a view of the LM during\ndocking maneuvers.\n\nLUNAR ORBIT PHOTOGRAPHY AFTER\nRENDEZVOUS AND DOCKING\nAfter docking on revolution 52 and transfer of the\ncrew and equipment to the CSM from the LM, the\nLM ascent stage was jettisoned on revolution 54. The\nreceding LM was photographed with CM DAC and\nthe Hasselblad camera.\nThe mapping camera was operated from terminator to terminator on revolution 62. From the\nfar-side terminator to near longitude 90" E, the CSM\nwas pitched up, and the tilt of the resultant forwardlooking oblique photographs varies somewhat with\nlongitude. Normal vertical orientation of the SIM\ncameras was attained near longitude 90" E and was\nmaintained throughout the remainder of the pass. On\nrevolution 65, the CSM was in a 40" north-looking\n\n4-25\n\noblique attitude when the mapping camera was\nswitched on near longitude 107" E. With the camera\nin operation, the CSM began a maneuver to the 40"\nsouth-looking oblique attitude near longitude 65" E\nand continued in that attitude to the terminator. The\nlast two periods of mapping camera operation in\nlunar orbit were terminator-to-terminator passes on\nrevolutions 66 and 74.\nThe panoramic camera was operated on revolution\n62 from near longitude 132" E to approximately 95"\nE, during which period the CSM was in a pitched-up\nattitude. As the CSM passed over the landing site on\nrevolution 62, 11 frames were exposed with the\ncamera in the monoscopic mode.\nAn area from Montes Apenninus across southern\nMare Imbrium to the terminator was photographed\nwith the Hasselblad camera and color film on\nrevolution 65.\nScheduled near-terminator photography was\naccomplished on revolution 62 near the craters\nGagarin and Lambert, on revolution 66 near the\ncrater T. Mayer, and on revolution 74 west of the\ncrater Brayley.\n\nTRANSEARTH COAST AND EARTH\nENTRY PHOTOGRAPHY\nAs the CSM receded rapidly from the Moon\nfollowing the transearth injection (TEI) maneuver,\n\n150-km-diameter crater Hirayama (centered at lat. 6" S, long. 93" E) extends across the middle one-third of the bottom of the\nphotograph. The bright rays in the extreme left corner are from a crater near latitude 15.5" S, loneitude 87.5" E. The crater\nDreyer (lat. 10" N , long. 96" E) is just outside the extreme riaht corner (panoramic camera frame AS17-2871).\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n4-26\n\nFIGURE 4-50.-Mare Orientale in earthshine.

Heada and Douglas Lloydb\n\nThe purposes of this paper are to illustrate and\ndescribe two types of special photograph (near terminator and earthshine) taken during the Apollo 17\nmission and to point out potential areas of its\nusefulness to encourage full utilization of the Apollo\n17 photographs in scientific investigations. Where\nappropriate, some description and preliminary interpretation are given to demonstrate the potential of\nvarious photographs.\nLunar surface photographs taken in the vicinity of\nthe sunshine terminator provide important information that is often unavailable on photographs taken at\nhigher Sun-elevation angles (such as Lunar Orbiter\nand most Apollo orbital photographs). Features that\nare particularly enhanced include those of low relief\n(such as mare flow fronts), craters of different\nmorphology (rimless depressions, secondaries, etc.),\nareas of contrasting crater densities, and small-scale\nstructures occurring on other low-relief features (such\nas mare ridges). Technical details of Apollo near-terminator photography are given in references 4-1 to\n4-4. During Apollo 17, two magazines of very-highspeed black-and-white (VHBW) film (2485) were\nexposed using the Electric Hasselblad (EL) camera on\n70-mm film format.\nPhotographs were also obtained under earthshine\nconditions in areas near the crater Copernicus, in\nwestern Oceanus Procellarum, and around the Orientale basin. Technical details of these photographs are\ndescribed in reference 4-2. During the Apollo 17\nmission, VHBW 35-mm film was exposed with a\nNikon camera.\n\nNEAR-TERM1 NATOR PHOTOGRAPHY\nApollo 17 Landing Site\nA near-terminator photograph of the Taurus-Littrow highlands and the Apollo 17 landing site\n(designated by the arrow) is shown in figure 4-62.\nThe ejecta blanket of the crater Vitruvius (in the\nlower left, approximately 30 km in diameter) is\nembayed by smooth mare material, thus indicating a\npremare age for the crater. The differences between\nterrain types are enhanced in this IowSun photograph. The flat, sparsely cratered mare regions around\n\nFIGURE 4-62.-Taurus-Littrow region; arrow indicates\nApollo 17 landing site.

The 10- to 20-km-diameter, smooth-sided massive mountain blocks (massifs) around the landing site also stand in marked\ncontrast to the finer-textured, domical, somewhat\nlineated Sculptured Hills, which make up the majority of the highlands in figure 4-62.\n\n4-3 5\n\nnarrows and sharpens to the left, and finally emerges\nas a zigzag scarp-like ridge. The much broader mare\narch to the north shows a somewhat similar trend\nwith the mare ridge being even more distinct as it\ncrosses from one side of the arch to the arch axis.\nSeveral apparently flooded craters (arrows) also can\nbe seen.\n\nPotential Volcanic Source Areas\n\nFlow Lobes and Flow Fronts\nA series of overlapping flows and flow fronts is\nlocated in Mare Imbrium, north of the crater Euler\n(fig. 4-63). These trend to the north and contain a\nwide variety of leveed flow channels (lower left). The\ndetailed sequence and history of these particular\nflows have been studied by Schaber (ref. 4-5).\nAlthough some of the major flow fronts have been\nvisible on higher Sun photographs, the detailed\nstructure and stratigraphy could not have been\nworked out without the lowsun photographs.\n\nSeveral features of possible volcanic origin (fig.\n4-65) are located in a group in southwestern Mare\nImbrium. The area is characterized by a series of low\nhummocky hills; a large, central, irregular rimless\ndepression; a series of crater chains; numerous meandering scarps; a long arcuate rille at the southeastern\nboundary; and a series of cone-like structures with\ncentral craters leading in a chain away from the\nnorthern end of the complex (base of fig. 4-65). The\nassemblage of volcanic structures located in this area\nsuggests that it may have been a center of mare\nvolcanic activity.\n\nMare Ridges\nA series of structures associated with mare ridges,\nwhich are typical of many mare structures, is shown\nin figure 4-64. Two broad mare arches (ref. 4-6) are\nvisible. The lower, narrower arch is broad at the right,\n\nFIGURE 4-64.-Mare arches and ridges (AS17-155-23767)\n\nMare Albedo and Structure Boundaries\nLow-Sun photographs enhance the contrast between major mare units, such as the central fill of\n\nFIGURE 4-65.-Possible center of mare volcanic activity in\nsouthwestern Mare Imbrium.

The dark annulus, a low albedo unit, partially\nlines the inner edge of Mare Serenitatis and has been\nmapped as Eratosthenian in age, while the higher\nalbedo central mare fill has been mapped as Imbrian\nin age (ref. 4-7). However, the dark annulus in\nsouthern Serenitatis (lower half of fig. 4-66) is laced\nwith linear rilles that terminate at or are embayed by\nthe central mare unit. Also, secondary craters from\nthe crater Plinius (just off the photograph at the\nlower right) occur up to the boundary with the\ncentral mare but not on the other side. These\nrelationships strongly suggest that the dark annulus\npredates the central mare of Serenitatis, at least in\nthis area.\n\nto the left. These mare domes may represent the\nlunar equivalent of shield volcanoes and may be\nsources for some of the mare lavas.\nA second type of domical mare structure is visible\nin southwestern Mare Imbrium near the crater Diophantus (figs. 4-68(a) and (b)). This structure (seen\n\nDomical Structures in Maria\nTwo general types of domical structures occurring\nin the maria are enhanced by low-Sun photographs.\nLow, broad circular domes with or without central\npit craters form one type; examples from northern\nMare Tranquillitatis are visible in figure 4-67(a)\n(arrows). A second example is visible west of the\ncrater Copernicus near T.

Effects of the Lee-Lincoln Scarp formation are\napparently superposed on North Massif talus; the age\nrelation to the dark mantle material is uncertain.\n10. The light mantle deposition was a probable\navalanche deposit of massif materials transported over\nthe dark mantle onto the valley floor.\n11. The Shorty-age and Van Serg-age cratering\nevents are indicated by small and relatively sharp\ncraters superposed on the younger surfaces of the\ndark and light mantles.\n12. For regolith and talus formation, it is assumed\nthat impact-generated regolith formed on all exposed\nsurfaces as a continuing process throughout lunar\nhistory. Talus has similarly accumulated at the base\nof all steep slopes.\nThe actual lunar surface traverses (fig. 6-2 of sec.\n6) were very close to those planned for the Apollo 17\nmission. It was intended to investigate the old,\npremare materials at the bases of both the South and\nNorth Massifs (station 2 and stations 6 and 7,\nrespectively) and possibly at the base of the Sculp-\n\ntured Hills (station 8). Wherever possible, large blocks\nwere t o be studied in preference t o other features.\nMaterials present beneath the valley floor and the\nnature of the major craters of the valley were to be\nstudied specifically in the walls and on the rims of\nseveral large craters; that is, Emory Crater at station 1\n(later moved to a location between the craters Steno\nand Powell), Camelot Crater at station 5 , and\nSherlock Crater at station 10 (later eliminated). These\nlarge-crater localities and the surface near the landing\npoint were also intended to be prime areas for\ninvestigating the dark floor materials. A concentrated\nlook at the light mantle that extends northeastward\nfrom the South Massif was planned for stations 2 , 3 ,\nand 4. Little work on this problem was possible at\nstation 4; however, a new station on the light mantle\n(station 2A) was added during the mission. Finally, a\nstudy of more recent cratering events, possibly\nvolcanic in origin, was set for station 4 at Shorty\nCrater and for station 9 at Van Serg Crater.\nThe premission objectives also included extensive\nplans for sampling lunar soil on the various geologic\nunits. This sampling included collection of samples\nfrom the lunar roving vehicle, core-tube samples,\n\nA GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE TAURUS-LITTROW VALLEY\n\n5-3\n\nFIGURE 5-3.-Apollo 17 panoramic camera photograph o f the Taurus-Littrow valley with the\ninformal names of various topographic features indicated.

The synthesis of the data contained in\ntranscripts and videotapes is relatively straightforward\nand constitutes the foundation of t h s report. The\nsynthesis of the data contained in the mind is more\ndifficult. Unlike normal field work on Earth, the\npressures of time and total efficiency on the Moon\nprevent the conscious mental recording of visual\nimages. Many images are recorded, to be sure, but\nsome are not subject to direct recall. Not only may an\n\n5-4\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nexternal stimulus, such as a photograph or a question,\nbe required to release these data, but there is a\ncontinued problem, which worsens as time passes, of\nseparating purely objective observational data from\nmore subjective feelings acquired since the mission. In\nrecognition of this problem, the transcripts and tapes\nhave been used extensively for verification of observations. Possible interpretive explanations and alternatives are included in the last section of this paper.\nThe observational environment in the TaurusLittrow valley is superb. Unfiltered sunlight is an\nexcellent light for visual investigation. When this light\nis combined with generally clean rock surfaces, there\nis little difficulty in distinguishing mineralogical and\ntextural differences. Albedo and textural differences\nin soil and rock surfaces also are readily apparent. For\nthe most part, the sampling of rocks and soils was\nbased on visually detectable differences or similarities. These characteristics were recognizable despite\nan overall brownish patina on most rock surfaces.\nUnfortunately, photographs cannot yet record much\nof the more subtle information available to the\nhuman eye.\n\nNOM ENCLATU R E\nIn this report, consistency with our field (transcript) terminology has been maintained except in a\nfew instances.

The\nmassifs represent the major structural boundaries of\nthe valley. Their faces contain intermittent exposures\nof thick sections of premare crustal rocks. Numerous\nfields, or \xe2\x80\x9csource-crops,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 of boulders are present on\nthe upper one-half to two-thirds of the slopes of both\nmassifs. Boulder tracks indicate that blocks have\nrolled into the valley from these sources. Several of\nthese blocks were the prime field objectives of our\ntraverses in the Taurus-Littrow valley.\nThe sourcecrops for the boulders on the slopes of\nthe North Massif are linear but discontinuous. They\nare roughly horizontal in apparent orientation, and\neach is a few hundred meters in length. The large\nboulder investigated at station 6 (fig. 5-4) has a\nwell-defined track above it and appears to have\noriginated from the lowermost sourcecrop band\napproximately one-third of the way up the slope.\nBased on what had been seen on previous lunar\nmissions, the geologic complexity of the boulders at\nstations 6 and 7 was unexpected. Here, for the first\ntime, it was possible to observe and sample across a\nmajor lithologic and structural contact. This contact\nwas exposed sharply in boulders large enough that\noutcrop investigative techniques could be applied. As\nalways, however, time was relentless and many\n\n6-111.\n\nF IE L D 0BSE R VAT IONS\nThe general historical or stratigraphic sequence of\nmajor geologic units in the Taurus-Littrow region was\nwell understood before our investigations on the\nsurface. What remained to be done was the correlation of the detailed field stratigraphic sequences with\nthis general regional sequence. The field observations\nare discussed in detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nFIGURE 5-4.-Vicw looking south from station 6 on the\nNorth Massif and including the large boulders of bluegray breccia (left) and tan-gray breccia (right) sampled\nat this locality (AS17-140-21496).\n\nA GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE TAURUS-LITTROW VALLEY\n\nquestions were only partially answered. Still, much\nwas learned.\nThree major categories of stratigraphic materials\nwere studied and sampled in the boulders at stations\n6 and 7. A younger, finely crystalline, strikingly\nvesicular, tan-gray , matrix-rich breccia (fig. 5-5) is\napparently in intrusive contact with an older, very\nfinely crystalline, blue-gray, fragment-rich breccia\n(fig. 5-6). There are inclusions of blue-gray breccia in\nthe tan-gray breccia at the contact in the station 6\nboulder. A blue-gray matrix-rich breccia is the material in direct contact with the tan-gray breccia in both\nthe contacts investigated. This blue-gray matrix-rich\nbreccia forms a contact zone approximately 1 m\nwide, apparently produced from the blue-gray jkzgment-rich breccia in the boulder at station 6. The\nlarge vesicles in the tan-gray breccia are ellipsoidal in\ncross section and are generally alined parallel to the\ncontact with the blue-gray breccia. There were some\nsmall vesicles in the blue-gray breccia near this\ncontact in the boulder at station 6.\nIn addition to the common small blue-gray fragments that dominate the blue-gray fragment-rich\nbreccia, there are distinctive clasts of light-gray\nbreccias. Within the contact zone at station 7, one of\nthese clasts is veined by blue-gray matrix-richbreccia\n\n.,\n\n\'\n\n5-5\n\n(fig. 5 7 . The clasts also appear deformed and\n-)\npartially mixed with blue-gray material in the station\n6 boulders. The distinctive clasts are apparently the\noldest stratigraphic materials sampled at the TaurusLittrow site.\nScattered, distinctive, light-colored clasts also are\npresent\' in the tan-gray breccia; however, the stratigraphic relations of these clasts to either the blue-gray\nbreccia or its included clasts were not apparent.\nA marked brown patina is well developed on all\nweathered rock surfaces in the Taurus-Littrow valley.\nThe patina is most prominent on the surfaces of the\nmassif breccias, including the fractured surfaces of\nthe blocks with well-preserved boulder tracks above\nthem at station 6.\nThe light-gray walls of craters on the slopes of the\nNorth Massif and light-gray material we uncovered\nwith our boots suggest that this type of fine debris,\nmixed with boulders, forms the bulk of the talus at\nthe base of the massif. Fillets of this material are\nlargely absent around boulders except on some uphill\nsides. Overlying the light-gray fine-grained talus is a\nmedium-gray surface material that is generally a few\ncentimeters thick. Unlike the filleted boulders of the\n\n.\n\nFIGURE 5-5. -Vesicular, tan-gray, matrix-rich breccia at\nstation 6.

The boulder is approximately 2 m wide\nand contains a sharp contact between vesicular tan-gray\nbreccia on the left and blue-gray breccia on the right. A\ntabular distinctive clast is present on the extreme right,\nand a weathering patina is indicated by light areas where\nsamples were taken (AS17-146-22336).\n\n5-6\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nFIGURE 5-7.-Vein of blue-gray matrix-rich breccia cutting a\ndistinctive clast of anorthositic matrix-rich breccia in the\nboulder at station 7.

The width of the angled end of the tongs is 6 cm\n(AS1 7-146-22327).\n\nvalley floor, the sides of boulders commonly overhang this surface material.\n\nThe South Massif\nThe rocks of the South Massif (fig. 5-8) constituted the prime geological objective on the mission to\nthe Taurus-Littrow valley, although the long traverse\nto the South Massif clearly taxed the operational\nlimits of our surface exploration capabilities. An\nhour-long trip to the edge of Nansen Crater at the\nbase of the massif, for approximately 60 min of\nexploration time there, meant that the remainder of\nthis excursion would be extremely limited in time\navailable for exploration. The boulders that were our\nspecific objectives held the promise of an unparalleled\nview into the history of the lunar crust. Although\novershadowed by more spectacular later discoveries,\nwe were not t o be disappointed by \xe2\x80\x9cold station 2.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe most obvious sources for the boulders near\nstation 2 are on the upper one-fourth of the South\nMassif slope. Visual inspection from a distance indicated that linear source-crops on this part of the massif and subtle linear color variations of blue-gray lying\nover tan-gray have an apparent dip of 10\xe2\x80\x9d to 15\xe2\x80\x9d to-\n\nFIGURE 5-8.-Southwest-looking view of the 2300-m-high\nSouth Massif as seen from station 6 at the base of the\nNorth Massif.

North Massif talus\ndebris is i the foreground (AS17-140-21491).\nn\n\nward the west. Offsets of the color changes, downward to the east, suggest that normal faults dipping\nsteeply eastward cut the massif structure.\nThe boulders investigated at station 2 (fig. 5-9)\nincluded crystalline, tan-gray matrix-rich breccia and\nblue-gray matrix-rich breccia, but no contact relations\nwere observed. The tan-gray breccia is less vesicular\nand more heterogeneous in texture than its North\nMassif counterpart. The sampled blue-gray breccia is\nsimilar to that found in the contact zones of the\nNorth Massif boulders. From a distance, boulders of\nboth these rock types have a tan-gray hue very similar\nto that of the materials below the blue-gray tones in\nthe high portions of the South Massif.\nThe distinctive clasts of contrasting shades and\nhues in the tan-gray and blue-gray breccias of the\nSouth Massif generally appear similar to those in the\nNorth Massif breccias. However, one crystalline clast\nin the boulder of blue-gray matrix-rich breccia has\nproved to be composed largely of olivine (sec. 7). The\npreliminary examination of rocks from both the\nSouth and North Massifs also suggests that various\ncrystalline mafic rocks and some ultramafic rocks\nmake up a significant portion of the distinctive clast\npopulation.\nThe third boulder examined at station 2 was a\nstrongly foliated and layered fragment-rich breccia\n\nA GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE TAURUS-LITTROW VALLEY\n\nFIGURE 5-9. -View looking southwest and encompassing the\nboulders investigated a t station 2. The boulders lie along\nthe base of the South Massif talus slope. The surface of\nthe light mantle is in the foreground. The lunar roving\nvehicle is 183 cm wide (AS17-138-21072).\n\n(fig. 5-10) that is much less coherent than either the\ntan-gray or blue-gray breccia types. This foliated and\nlayered breccia contains large clasts of both dark- and\nlightcolored older breccias in a generally lightcolored matrix. There are also small clasts with\ndistinctive dark coronas around them. From a distance, this boulder has a blue-gray hue very similar to\nthat of the blue-gray materials observed near the top\nof the western portion of the South Massif.\nAlong the boundary between the South Massif and\nthe valley floor, there is a trough. This trough is much\nbroader and more continuous than had been apparent\nbefore the mission. The trough is a few hundred\nmeters wide at station 2, is flat floored, and seems\nto include the crater Nansen as an integral, although\nmuch deeper, topographic unit.\nThe observed properties of the talus material at\nthe base of the South Massif are very similar to those\nobserved at the North Massif. In Nansen Crater, it is\nalso clear that at least some of the South Massif talus\nforms a younger toe of debris over the valley floor,\nparticularly over the light mantle deposits present in\nNansen (fig. 5-1 1).\n\n5-7\n\nFIGURE 5-10.-Foliated and layered breccia investigated a t\nstation 2. Four samples were obtained across the layering,\nwhich trends from the upper left to the lower right in the\nphotograph. The visible portion of the gnomon rod is\napproximately 45 cm long (AS17-137-20903).\n\nFIGURE 5-ll.-View from near station 2, looking northwest\ninto the crater Nansen and along the contact between the\nSouth Massif talus and the light mantle. Note the lobe of\ntalus debris lying on the light mantle in Nansen. The\nboulders are on the order of 3 to 5 m in diameter\n(AS17-13&21058).\n\n5-8\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nThe Sculptured Hills\nThe interlocking domes of the Sculptured Hills\nform the northeastern wall of the Taurus-Littrow\nvalley. The origin of this unusual physiographic unit\nremains unknown, although some relation to the\nprocesses associated with the Serenitatis impact event\nis indicated by morphologically similar units near\nother large lunar basins (ref. 5-2).\nOur investigation at station 8 on the lower slopes\nof the Sculptured Hills gave no definitive evidence\nabout the nature of bedrock units. Concentrations of\nboulders were observed only near the tops of the\nhills, and no boulder tracks were apparent above the\nfew blocks visible on the lower slopes (fig. 5-12). The\nsurface texture of the slope material on the Sculptured Hills is of much finer scale and is more wrinkled\nin appearance than that of comparably lighted slopes\non the massifs.\nOf the six blocks examined in the vicinity of\nstation 8, five were composed of crystalline basalt\nsimilar to that in the Camelot-Steno area. The sixth\nblock was a black, glasscoated, coarsely crystalline\nrock made up of approximately equal parts of a\nyellowish mafic mineral and white to bluish-gray\nplagioclase and maskelynite. This apparently exotic\n\nFIGURE 5-12.-View from station 8 looking northeast up\nthe slope of the Sculptured Hills Note the small number\nof boulders relative to the talus deposits around the\nmassifs.

Other exotic\nwhite fragments in small secondary craters appeared\nto be anorthositic matrix-rich breccias (fig. 5-13.\n)\nThe soil on the slope material at station 8 has a\nuniform grain size and is medium to dark gray in\ncolor in a trench dug to a depth of 30 cm (fig. 5-14).\nIn this regard, the slope materials of the Sculptured\nHills resemble the soils on the dark floor material in\nthe valley rather than those on the massifs or on the\nlight mantle.\n\nThe Valley Floor\nThe dark floor of the Taurus-Littrow valley is\nunderlain by a body of basalt between the bounding\nmassifs. Since formation, this material has been\nsubjected to a variety of cratering, depositional,\nstructural, and possibly volcanic processes. In addition to the investigation of block fields in the valley,\nour goals included the study of the Camelot- and\nSteno-age cratering events, the depositional characteristics of the dark floor material, the structural\nhistory of the valley floor, and any volcanic features\nwe might encounter.\n\nFIGURE 5-13.-Secondary crater approximately 1 m in\ndiameter in the wall of a larger crater near station 8. The\ncentral portion of the secondary crater contains several\nfragments of white, anorthositic, matrix-rich breccia that\nappears to have been part of the crater-forming projectile\n(AS17-146-22399).\n\nA GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE TAURUS-LITTROW VALLEY\n\nThe block fields concentrated near and in the large\ncraters in the Camelot-Steno area allowed a rather\ncomprehensive investigation of the basalts. The\nblocks are largely massive, tan to pinkish-gray,\ncoarse-grained, ilmenite basalts generally having a\ncoarsely vesicular texture. Isolated examples of eggsized vesicles were observed near the crater Bronte.\nLocally, there is a strong foliation formed by the\noccurrence of parallel parting planes or fractures (fig.\n5-15). The blocks on the rim of Camelot Crater at\nstation 5 showed parallel layers defined by differences in vesicle concentrations.\nOnly two fragments of aphanitic basalt were\nobserved despite a search for this variety at each\nsampling site. Both fragments were finely porphyritic,\nand the one from the crater Shorty was very coarsely\nvesicular. Other fine-grained to aphanitic basalt fragments are present in the suites of small fragments\ncollected in rake and soil samples (sec. 7).\nIn some blocks, finely textured blue-gray basalt\nforms isolated irregular lenses within the tan-gray\ncoarse-grained basalt (fig. 5-16). Material of a similar\nblue-gray color was seen from a distance in the\nwestern wall of the crater Cochise, where it forms a\nunit several tens of meters thick over a tan-gray unit\n(fig. 5-17). The contact has an apparent dip of\n\nFIGURE 5-14.-The trench wall in soil at station 8 on the\nslope of the Sculptured Hills. Note the lack of apparent\nstructure within the soil.

Note the mediumgay unit\nlying over the light-gray unit in the western wall of the\ncrater. The apparent dip of the contact between the two\nunits is to the north. The units are tentatively interpreted\nto be varieties of basalt based on visual similarities to\nother basalts investigated in detail (AS17-146-22411).\n\napproximately 20" to the north. The units in Cochise\nCrater could be the two varieties of subfloor basalt.\nIn general, however, the tan-gray coarsely vesicular\nvariety of subfloor basalt is dominant (at least 95\npercent) in the basaltic block fields along our\ntraverses.\nA general absence of obvious shock effects was\nnoted in the blocks of basalt studied in the field.\nOther than the pervasively fractured basalt block at\nShorty Crater and possibly the very-fine-grained\nmylonitic zones along isolated fractures in other\nblocks, the basalts seemed to have been only slightly\nmetamorphosed by the formation of large craters in\nthe valley. Despite the paucity of shock effects, the\nmorphology of the large craters is consistent with\ntheir being impact craters of at least two general age\ngroups that have been subsequently modified by the\ndeposition of the dark floor material.\nThe floor of the valley is largely covered with this\ndark material. Below the dark floor surface, there are\nprobably interlayered ejecta blankets from the various large craters. Boulders in these ejecta blankets\nproject above the surface in the lunar module and\nSteno Crater areas.\n\nThe regolith on dark floor material consists of\nloose, fine, senate debris with few fragments larger\nthan approximately 1 cm (fig. 5-18). The regolith is a\nsparkling dark gray at the surface with even darker\ngray material just below the surface, at least in the\noptically lightened area near the lunar module (fig.\n5-19).\nLocally, the fragment populations on the dark\nfloor material are quite variable. In the general\nvicinity of the Steno-class craters that form the\ncluster of craters south of the landing point, the\nfragment frequency is higher b) a factor of 4 or 5\nthan it is near the Camelot-class craters or in areas\nalong the traverse west of Camelot Crater and near\nthe crater Shakespeare. Although coherent soil\nbreccias were sought in this general area, none were\nrecognized; however, a few examples were collected\n(sec. 7) inadvertently as a consequence of attempts to\nsample fine-grained basaltic materials.\nThe dark floor material has many field characteristics that suggest it is a mantling deposit, as do its\ncharacteristics as seen from orbit and in orbital\nphotographs (ref. 5-4 and part B of sec. 29). The field\ncharacteristics are as follows.\n1. The block fields associated with large craters\n\nFIGURE 5-18.-View from the lunar module (LM) landing\nsite looking north across dark floor material toward the\nNorth Massif. The surface in the foreground is typical of\nthe dark floor material relative to the abundance of\ncraters and basalt fragments. The small crater just right of\ncenter in the photograph is approximately 3 m in\ndiameter (AS17-136-20693).\n\nA GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE TAURUS-LITTROW VALLEY\n\nFIGURE 5-19.-View from LM window looking west toward Family Mountain. The ALSEP site is at the center\nof the photograph. Note that the local area around the\nLM has a higher albedo than that of more distant areas of\nthe valley or of the disturbed dark floor material nearby.\nThe mechanical effect of the descent engine effluents\nappears to have caused a change in the albedo of the\nimmediate surface near the landing point (AS17140-21355).\n\nare largely confined to the inner walls of the craters\n(fig. 5-20). The rims of these craters are generally\ncovered by dark floor material for distances of 20 to\n30 m down the crater wall from the rim. Locally, the\nblock fields of the crater walls extend up to, but\nrarely over, the rim crest (fig. 5-21). In these few\nplaces, the edge of the block field terminates sharply\nagainst the dark floor material outside the crater. No\ndifferences were observed between dark floor material on or away from crater rims.\n2. Dark floor material locally extends over crater\nwalls in long downward-pointing fans that apparently\nbury the wall block fields. The crater floors are\nuniversally covered by the same material.\n3. Dark floor material constitutes the interblock\nmaterial in all block fields (fig. 5-22). If the large\nblocks of the block fields are assumed to be generally\nequidimensional in shape, then they are approximately half buried in the dark floor material that\nsurrounds each individual block. However, no dark\nfloor material distinctly mantles the top of any block.\n4. All observed craters in dark floor material that\nare between approximately 5 and 80 m in diameter\nhave dark floor material on their ejecta blankets,\nrims, walls, and floors. However, there is no indication of extensive filling of such craters. Van Serg was\nthe only observed crater that had a clearly defined\nblocky rim. Fresh craters less than 5 m in diameter\n\n5-1 1\n\nFIGURE 5-20.-View from station 5 looking north across the\ncrater Camelot and toward the North Massif.

Fillets tend to be low on\nboulders on the valley floor, although isolated exceptions to this rule were observed, particularly near the\nApollo lunar surface experiments package (ALSEP)\ndeployment site.\nThe visually apparent saturation crater size on the\ndark floor material is probably approximately 0.5 m,\nwhich suggests a 10-cmdeep gardened zone. Mechanical penetrability decreased markedly below approximately 10 to I 5 cm, and hand penetration with a\ncore tube was impossible below approximately 25 cm\nunder the lunar module.\n\nThe Light Mantle Area\nThe plume- or ray-shaped light-albedo area that\nextends northward from the South Massif is known as\nthe light mantle. Photogeologic interpretation suggested that this was a relatively young mantling\nmaterial derived from the South Massif talus (ref.\n5-3). The geometry of its contact and the dark\nmaterial excavated by some of the larger craters on it\nstrongly suggest that the light mantle deposition\noccurred after most of the dark floor material had\nbeen deposited. Whether this light mantle material\nwas a ray of ejecta or mobilized South Massif talus or\n\nFIGURE 5-23.-Regolithic debris partly filling cracks and\ndepressions on a large basalt block at station 5.

The gray scale on the gnomon is 30 cm long\n(AS 17-145-22155).\n\nboth and speculation on the possible mechanisms of\ndeposition were questions posed in our premission\nplanning.\nThe surface of the light mantle is composed of\nloose, medium-gray, finely seriate debris with an\napparently large deficiency of fragments in size ranges\ngreater than approximately 1 cm (fig. 5-24). Very few\nrock fragments or boulders larger than a few centimeters were observed; this characteristic contrasts\nsharply with the talus debris on the South Massif. The\nlight mantle surface was very similar in general visual\ncharacter, however, to the fine debris surface on the\nSouth Massif talus slope. Fragments of breccia similar\nto those at station 2 were found slightly concentrated\non the rim of and inside the 30-m-diameter Ballet\nCrater in the light mantle at station 3 (fig. 5-25). In\ngeneral, fragment concentrations were present on the\nrims and in the walls of craters having diameters\ngreater than approximately 5 m.\nA dilated and inverted section of the light mantle\nmay be present in the fine-grained debris just outside\nthe rim of Ballet Crater. A trench in this rim (fig.\n5-26) showed the debris to be layered from the\nsurface downward as follows.\n1.

Observations of crater characteristics infer that\nconcentrations of rock fragments occur at depths of\napproximately 1 m below the surface of the light\nmantle.\nLight-gray material is present 5 t o 10 cm below\nthe medium-gray surface material at all localities\ninvestigated in the light mantle area. Light-gray\nmaterial is also present in the walls of all craters in\nthis area having diameters greater than approximately\n1 m. This soil profile is very similar to that developed\non the massif talus slopes.\nThe contacts between the light mantle and both\n\ni\n\n5-14\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nthe dark floor material of the valley and the dark\nmaterial around Shorty Crater are gradational in\nalbedo over a distance of approximately 1 0 m. A\ndistinct difference in albedo of the two types of\nsurfaces is visible when viewed at zero-phase angle.\nAlso, there is an obvious change in the wall color of\ncraters larger than 1 m in diameter. No topographic\nexpression at these contacts was detected.\nThe light mantle surfaces above, on, or below the\nLee-Lincoln Scarp show no discernible differences in\ncrater population, fragment population, or surface\ntexture.\nCraters smaller than approximately 5 m in diameter were found to have a consistent morphology\nwhether in light mantle, dark floor material, or massif\ntalus (fig. 5-27). In summary, the freshest of these\ncraters have the following characteristics.\n1. The crater ejecta, rim, wall, and floor are\ncovered with fragments of weakly coherent soil\nbreccia as large as 10 to 15 cm in average diameter.\nThe albedo of these soil breccias is much higher in the\nlight mantle than on the dark floor material.\n2. The soil breccia fragments inside the crater\n\ntend to be oriented with their long axes radial to the\ncenter of the crater.\n3. There is a central pit in an otherwise relatively\nflat floor. The diameter of the pit is approximately\none-fourth to one-fifth the rim diameter of the crater.\nThe pit is generally shallow, in most cases less than\none-tenth the depth of the crater. However, this\ndepth does vary; in one instance, the pit was nearly\none-half the depth of the crater and roughly cylindrical in shape.\n4. The central pit is glass lined with the glass\nforming a coating and partially cementing the soil\nbreccia fragments.\n5. The relative geometry of the pit with respect to\nthe crater appears to be constant and independent of\ncrater size or of geologic unit.\n6. Overall, the albedo of the crater and its ejecta is\nslightly higher than that of its surroundings.\n\nAs the crater ages, the order of the disappearance of\nprimary features is, first, the albedo contrast, then\nthe glass in the central pit, then the soil breccias, and,\nfinally, the central pit itself.\nShorty Crater\n\nFIGURE 5-27.-View from between the LM and ALSEP sites\nlooking east toward the LM. A portion of a fresh,\n3-m-diameter crater is in the foreground. The glassy\ncentral pit of this crater is the slightly more reflective area\nin the center of the crater. Note the abundance of small\nfragments of soil breccia in and around the crater\n( A i l 7-145-22185).\n\nOne of the premission alternatives around which\nour exploration was planned was the possibility that\nthe 110-m-diameter crater Shorty was a volcanic vent.\nAlthough its general morphological appearance is that\nof a dark-rayed impact crater that had penetrated the\nlight mantle, Shorty Crater held out the possibility of\nyoung volcanism. Other than Shorty, possible sources\nfor the potential pyroclastic deposits of the dark\nfloor material were difficult to delineate. The observations and sampling at Shorty Crater did not reveal\ndirectly what we had expected; however, the results\nof the investigation may yield equally important\ninformation from unexpected directions.\nAU the now classic difficulties in conducting\ngeological operations on the surface of the Moon\nfaced us at Shorty Crater. To begin with, we had\nmade earlier decisions to spend extra time at previous\nlocalities without knowing what awaited us. Our\noxygen supply limited the time we could spend at\nShorty Crater to a clearly nonnegotiable 35 min. The\nnormal \xe2\x80\x9chousekeeping\xe2\x80\x9d duties of dusting and reading\nthe mavimeter demanded their usual but neceSSarv\n\xe2\x80\x9d\ndue. Then, in addition to the usual complexities of\n\xe2\x80\x99\nlunar impact geology, an unexpected discovery\nappeared.\n\nA GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE TAURUS-LITTROW VALLEY\n\nShorty Crater has features consistent with an\nimpact origin, although no one feature is conclusive\nin itself. Subfloor basalt appears to dominate the few\nblocks at the rim (fig. 5-28). One of these blocks is\npervasively fractured and may be shocked. The crater\nwall is locally blocky and has several radial and\ntransverse changes in texture and albedo. There is no\ncontinuous bench in the crater wall; however, several\nwell-defined lobes of coarse and fine debris, similar to\nthose in the walls, extend out onto the floor and may\nbe the relics of such a bench (fig. 5-29). The blocky\nmaterials on the flat floor appeared to be highly\nfractured but otherwise uniform in texture. Parallel\nfracture organization is strong in some blocks.\nThe unexpected discovery at Shorty Crater was\nthe presence of at least three deposits of very-finegrained orange soil (fig. 5-30). There were also\nnumerous indications of fine-grained black soil,\nwhich, together with the orange soil, was subsequently determined to be composed almost entirely\nof glass beads or devitrified glass beads of uniform\ncomposition (sec. 7). Two of the orange soil deposits\nare near the rim crest of the crater, whereas the other\ndeposit is exposed on the western wall. In appearance, the deposits have many of the characteristics of\nfumarolic alteration halos; with this hope, we conducted our observation and sampling activities.\nOne deposit of orange soil was trenched across its\ntrend along the crater rim. At this location, it was\n\nFIGURE 5-28.-The southern rim of Shorty Crater looking\nwest. The sampled orange soil deposit is a t the left center\nof the photograph near the large boulder.

The gnomon rod is 46 cm long\n(AS1 7-1 37-20990).\n\n5-1 6\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nsampled in detail and the following relationships were\nobserved.\n1. The deposit is approximately 1 by 4 m in size\nat the surface and is elongate parallel to the rim crest.\n2. The deposit has no topographic relief relative\nto other rim surfaces. (This is also true for the other\nrim deposit.)\n3. Dark-gray surface material forms an approximately 0.5-cm-thick surface layer over both the\ndeposit and the surrounding light-gray materials.\nThere is an orange tint to this surface material\ndirectly over the deposit.\n4. The contact of the deposit with light-gray\ndebris on either side is irregular in detail but\nessentially vertical to a depth of at least 20 cm.\n5. From the vertical contacts inward, the deposit\ngrades from a yellowish orange over a distance of\napproximately 10 or 15 cm to a reddish orange.\n6. The reddish-orange inner portion of the deposit\nis moderately coherent and is crossed by at least two\napparent joint sets.\n7. During the postmission unpacking of a sample\nfrom the reddish-orange zone, a clod was observed\nthat was sharply and concentrically zoned inward\nfrom orange brown-gray to bluish gray.\n8. Examinations of the outer surface of the core\ntube drawn from the deposit showed that the orange\nglass changes sharply to a black material at a depth of\napproximately 25 cm. The black material extends to\na depth of at least 70 cm.\nOne can conceive of many samples and observations left uncollected at this remarkable locality.\nHowever, few of our experiences in the Apollo\nProgram better illustrate the inherent quality of\nscientific investigation that is possible from the\nintegrated effort of so many in so short a time.\n\nVan Serg Crater\nPremission photogeologic studies suggested that\nthe relatively fresh appearing 90-m-diameter crater\nVan Serg would provide an impact-generated sample\nof the section of units lying above the basalts of the\nvalley. Located just south of the craters Cochise and\nShakespeare, Van Serg Crater might also penetrate\nand sample ejecta from these much older craters. As\nat Shorty Crater, the unexpected again was encountered.\nAll features of Van Serg Crater were consistent\nwith an impact origin (fig. 5-31). However, unex-\n\nFIGURE 5-31.-View of the northwestern wall of Van Serg\nCrater. The diameter of the crater is approximately 90 m.\nThe dark fans on the inner wall terminate at the top of a\nnearly continuous bench. The upper portion of the\ngnomon rod is approximately 30.5 cm long (AS17-14622429).\n\npected, dark, matrix-rich, regolithic breccias were\nfound to be the dominant rock type on the blocky\nrim and the equally blocky ejecta blanket. Such\nbreccias had not been observed elsewhere in the\nvalley.\nA few of the Van Serg breccias are intensely\nfractured and very friable, and others are mixed or\ncovered with black glass. No basalt was observed,\nalthough one fragment was obtained as a glass-coated\ngrab sample. A dark surface cover a few centimeters\nthick exists over light-gray debris in some of the\ninterblock areas and may cover all the ejecta blanket\nand rim. The dark cover may be the disintegration\nproduct of the dark breccias or, alternatively, it may\nbe a separate mantle. Most blocks are partially\nembedded in this material.\nThe crater wall is very blocky and is interrupted\nby a nearly continuous bench approximately halfway\ndown into the crater. Rocks below the bench are\nslightly darker in color than those above. Dark fans of\ndark-gray debris locally cross over the rim and down\nthe upper wall but generally terminate at the bench.\nThe crater floor is also very blocky with some intense\n\nA GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE TAURUS-LITTROW VALLEY\n\nshattering of blocks, although, in contrast to Shorty\nCrater, the blocks are much larger. Some of the floor\nblocks are coarse, blue-gray, fragment-rich breccias\nwith light-colored clasts as large as 1 m in diameter.\nThe general nature of the floor breccias of Van\nSerg Crater and the visual observation of a thick,\nnorthward-dipping, blue-gray unit above the subfloor\nbasalt in the northern wall of Cochise Crater opens\nthe possibility of a major new breccia unit in this\nportion of the valley. The possible origins and\nstructural implications of such a unit are not yet\nclear.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\nA number of special features were examined and\nsampled during our general investigation of the\nTaurus-Littrow valley. These features are only peripherally related t o the general stratigraphy of the area\nand are discussed separately in the following paragraph.\n\nRock Fragment Weathering\nIn all instances except for Van Serg Crater and the\nsmall pit-bottomed craters, the rock fragments\naround and in craters on the dark floor surface are\nthe very coherent subfloor basalts. The fragments\nassociated with craters in the light mantle are the\nsimilarly coherent tan-gray and blue-gray breccias. In\ncontrast, the Van Serg-type dark matrix-rich breccias\nand the soil breccias in the pit-bottomed craters\nappear to have limited durability in the valley\nenvironment.\nThe gross shape of coherent rock fragments is\nangular. Edges and corners are rounded except where\nrecent impact fracturing has occurred. The gross\nshape of pervasively fractured and friable rock fragments also tends to be angular, but, in these cases, the\nedges and corners are also angular. The only generally\nrounded rock fragments observed were the unfractured dark matrix-rich breccias at Van Serg Crater.\nThe weathered surfaces of all subfloor basalts,\nexcept for the aphanitic group, are lighter colored\nthan are the fresh surfaces. The lighter color appears\nto be due to the surficial shattering of feldspar in\nmicrocraters. This observation is generally true but to\na lesser degree for the very finely crystalline breccias\nof the massifs. Glass linings in microcraters are more\ncommon on these breccia surfaces than they are on\nthe basalt surfaces.\nThe coarse-grained subfloor basalts also have a\n\n5-1 7\n\ncoarse mottled texture that shows a roughly horizontal lineation on near-vertical surfaces. The elongate\nlight-colored areas that cause the mottling are approximately 1 by 2 cm in size. The origin of this mottling\nand its lineation was not apparent in the field but\nmay be related to the impact geometry of secondary\nparticles.\n\nBoulder Tracks\nAmong the most striking and potentially most\nuseful features of the massifs are the boulder tracks\nleading from sourcecrops high on the slopes to large\nboulders near their bases (fig. 5-32). It appears that\nonce a boulder is jarred loose and begins to roll, only\na decrease in slope or the disintegration of the\nboulder will stop it.\nThe tracks are made up of chains of small\ndepressions. These chains are generally straight; however, gradual curves were noted in some instances.\nNot all tracks are exactly perpendicular to the\ncontours, and, in some cases, the tracks curve\nnoticeably.\nMost boulders stopped rolling at least a few tens of\nmeters before reaching the base of the massif slope.\nHowever, two large boulders in the crater Nansen\nmoved across the base of the slope and up the other\nside of the crater for several tens of meters.\n\nFIGURE 5-32.-A 500-mm-lens photograph of boulders and\nboulder tracks on the slopes of the North Massif. The\nlargest boulders are on the order of 5 m in diameter\n(AS1 7-144-21991).\n\n5-1 8\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nThe Lee-Lincoln Scarp\nLittle new information was obtained on the\nLee-Lincoln Scarp (fig. 5-33) through our surface\nobservations. There is no surface expression of the\nscarp other than the topography, which was well\nknown before the mission. The east-west trending\nlobes that characterize the scarp on the valley floor\nwere particularly impressive. No indication of rocky\nbedrock was seen on any portion of the scarp,\nalthough large blocks are present on the northwestern\nwall of Lam Crater.\nThe most striking new observation was the change\nin surface texture across the Jefferson portion of the\nscarp on the North Massif. The lineations apparent on\nthe North Massif are not present on the surface south\nand southwest of the scarp. Also, fewer craters are\napparent on the southern and southwestern side. This\nless-textured surface appears to be continuous across\nthe break in slope at the base of the North Massif.\n\nSoil Sampling\nThe soils of the Moon are the prime historical\nrecord of the lunar surface environment and of the\nsolar and cosmic environment of near-Earth space.\nThe presence of the massifs, of boulder overhangs, of\nthe Lee-Lincoln Scarp, and of a number of different\nstratigraphic surfaces made possible the collection of\na wide variety of soil samples in the valley of\nTaurus-Littrow. In addition, at most documentedsample localities, a standardized 0.5-to l-cm-thick\nskim sample of the local surface was obtained,\nfollowed by a sample of the underlying soil to a\ndepth of approximately 5 cm. Also, most rock\nsamples were bagged with a small amount of soil.\nA new sampling device for sampling from the lunar\nroving vehicle permitted a substantial increase in\nstatistical control of soil variations between stations.\nThis device also made possible a broader sampling of\nthe lunar module area in the course of other\nactivities.\nSoil samples for volatile migration studies, such as\nin east-west split boulder (or boulder-massif) situations, and from permanently shadowed overhangs\nwere obtained at both the North and South Massif\nstudy sites. Samples in the center of and outside a\nboulder track were taken on the North Massif. Also,\nsamples from underneath boulders were obtained at\nthe South Massif and Sculptured Hills sites.\n\nc\n\nFIGURE 5-33.-View from near Hole-in-the-Wall looking\nnorth along the Lee-Lincoln Scarp and showing the\nJefferson Scarp along the side of the North Massif.\nStation 3 is in the left foreground on the slope of the\nscarp. The scarp rises approximately 80 m above the\nsurface of the valley, here covered by the light mantle\n(AS17-138-21118).\n\nThe possibility of increased volatile activity along\nthe Lee-Lincoln Scarp was used to establish the site\nfor a vacuum-sealed core-tube sample taken at a\ndepth of 35 to 70 cm in soil on the scarp at station 3.\nCore-tube samples also were obtained in the soils of\nall major geologic units and in the orangelblack glass\ndeposit at Shorty Crater.\nIn addition to the vertical soil profiles sampled by\nthe core tubes, trench profiles were sampled in the\nrim of Ballet Crater, in the slope material at the base\nof the Sculptured Hills, and in the ejecta blanket of\nVan Serg Crater.\nFinally, to aid in examining the recent magnetic\nfield of the valley, two agglutinated glass and soil\nbreccia samples were obtained, one from the pit in a\nfresh crater west of the lunar module and the other\nfrom a glassy mass on the rim of Van Serg Crater.\nThese glasses appeared to have been undisturbed since\nthey cooled in situ.\n\nThe Regolith\nIt appears that regolith development on the massif\ntalus materials and on the light mantle is indicated by\n\nA GEOLOGICAL\n\nINVESTIGATION\n\nthe average depth of medium-gray\nsoil above the\nfighter gray material. The depth of this regolith is on\nthe order of 5 to 10 cm.\nThe regolith on the dark floor material is more\ndifficult to define visually. In the vicinity of the lunar\nmodule,\nthe loose or very weakly coherent\ndebris\nappears to be approximately\n15 to 20 cm deep. This\ndepth is roughly consistent\nwith what appeared to be\nan approximately\n0.5- to 1-m-diameter\nsaturation\ncrater size for the surface, which suggests that the age\nof the dark floor surface is only two or three times\nthat of the light mantle surface or of the present talus\nsurfaces.\nBoth the dark floor material and the light mantle\nhave intercrater\nsurfaces covered by the "raindrop"\npattern of small craters. This pattern appears better\ndef\'med and finer in scale on the light mantle than on\nthe dark floor surface. No systematic linear structures\nwere visible on either the light mantle surface or the\ndark floor surface. Such structure\nwas apparent on\nthe steep slopes of the massifs and the Sculptured\nHills; however,\nthese\nslopes are better\nanalyzed\nphotographically\nthan visually.\nSTRATIGRAPHIC\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIt is yet very premature\nto come to any final\nconclusion\non major portions\nof the stratigraphic\nsequence in the valley of Taurus-Littrow\nor on the\nnature of the processes by which this sequence came\ninto being. The laboratory\ninvestigations\nhave yet to\nbe completed\nor to be integrated\nfully with the field\nobservations.\nHowever, it is possible to summarize the\nprobable\nstratigraphic\nsequences\nindicated\nby the\nfield data and to list many of the interpretive\nalternatives for the petrogenesis\nof the major rocks and\nsoils of the valley.\n\nOF THE TAURUS-LITTROW\n\nThe oldest to youngest stratigraphic\nunits that are\npresent as bedrock in the North and South Massifs are\nas follows.\n(Interpretive\nstatements\nare listed in\nparentheses.)\n1. Light-gray breccia and crystalline rock as distinctive clasts in the blue-gray breccias. (These clasts\nmay possibly be closely related to the differentiates\nof an early melted hmar crust.)\n2. Crystalline,\nblue-gray,\nfragment-rich\nbreccias\nand their metamorphic\nequivalents.\n(These breccias\nare possibly\nquenched\nand brecciated\nimpact melts\n\n5-19\n\nproduced\nduring the formation\nof the large lunar\nbasins or even older events.)\n3. Crystalline,\ntan-gray,\nmatrix-rich\nbreccia and\nany metamorphic\neffects associated with its intrusion\ninto the blue-gray breccias. (These intrusions may be\npartially molten impact breccias, possibly of Serenitatis age, or polygenetic\ntuff-breccia\neruptives\nof\nundetermined\norigin.)\n4. Foliated and layered breccia of low metamorphic grade that is rich in a variety of breccia clasts\nand that appears to correlate with units near the crest\nof the South Massif. (These rocks may be representative of the youngest large-basin ejecta blankets in the\nregion, possibly equivalent in mode of origin or even\nin age to the Fra Mauro Formation.)\nAlthough certainly\ncomplex internally,\nthe dominant fabric of the North Massif apparently\nis that of\nroughly\nhorizontal\nstructural\nunits that may be\ndepositional\nor intrusive layers. In the South Massif,\nthese units appear to be tilted westward or southwestward. High-angle normal faulting and tan-gray breccia\nintrusions\napparently\nbreak the continuity\nof the\nstructural\nfabrics in both massifs. The tilting and\nfaulting of massif units may relate to their uplift\nduring the Serenitatis\nimpact event or subsequent\nmajor basin events (or both).\nA general similarity\nis evident in the visual and\nlithologic characteristics\nof the tan-gray and blue-gray\nbreccias studied at the North and South Massifs. This\nsimilarity suggests that a general lithologic correlation\ncan be made across the valley. The differences in rock\ncharacteristics\nmay be explained by different ages of\nformation\nthrough similar processes or by different\ndepths of burial (approximately\n1.5 km in the North\nMassif and approximately\n0.5 km in the South\nMassif).\nThe\n\nThe Massifs\n\nVALLEY\n\nValley\n\nFloor\n\nThe most complex\nstratigraphic\nand structural\nproblems in the Taurus-Littrow\nvalley are those of\nthe valley floor and the materials\nbeneath it. This\ncomplexity\nis introduced\nby two factors. First, there\nis the very great absolute\nage, approximately\n3.7\nbillion years, of the orange/black\nglass deposit at\nShorty\nCrater\n(ref. 5-5) and its relatively young\nexposure\nage, approximately\n8 million years (ref.\n5-6). Presumably,\nthese ages apply to similar glasses in\nthe dark floor materials.\nSecond, there is the discovery of a thick (greater than 15 m) breccia unit of\nregolithic character at Van Serg Crater.\n\n5-20\n\nAPOLLO PRELIMINARY\n17\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nThe purity, the geometric\nconstraints,\nand the\npetrographic\ncharacteristics\n(sec. 7) of the orange/\nblack glass deposit at Shorty Crater and the relative\nages of the deposit require the following to hold true\n\nenvironment\nmay account\nfor their rarity around\nother, possibly\nolder craters such as Shorty. The\nexistence of orange and black glasses and of subfloor\nbasalt fra_nents\nin these breccias (sec. 7) strongly\n\nfor its glasses.\n1. The glasses were deposited at the lunar surface\nover a major unit of subfloor basalt or on an early\nregolith unit derived from the sub floor basalt.\n\nsuggests that they are the product\nof the general\nlong-term regolith development\nin the valley.\nTaking into account\nthese considerations\nand the\n\n2. The glasses were then almost\nprotected\nfrom regolithic\nmixing\nat\npossibly by an ejecta blanket or by a\nflow, for a period of approximately\n3.7\n3. The glasses were then ejected onto\ninto the rim of Shorty Crater less than 8\n\nimmediately\nthe surface,\nthin basaltic\nbillion years.\nor intruded\nmillion years\n\nago, producing a very restrictive geometric situation.\nGlasses similar to the orange/black\nglasses have\nbeen reported mixed with basaltic debris in the dark\nfloor materials (sec. 7). The apparently\nrecent mantling over the valley craters by dark floor materials\nand the apparently\nthin regolith developed on these\nmaterials impose other general constraints\non their\nstratigraphy\nand origin. The indications\nare very\nstrong\nthat since the formation\nof a widespread\nmantling deposit of orange/black\nglass approximately\n3.7 billion years ago, some other process has acted\nmore or less continuously\nto recycle this glass and\nproduce the presently observed young mantling relationships.\nIn view of the presence of certain low-temperature\nvolatile components\nin the orange/black\nglasses (sec.\n7), it is possible that impact events in the general size\nrange of Shorty Crater will trigger the release of such\ngas as a fluidizing medium for local remobilization\nand extrusion. The known field characteristics\nof the\norange/black\n\nglass\n\ndeposits\n\nand\n\nof\n\nthe\n\ndark\n\nfloor\n\nmaterial are reconcilable with a process of this nature\nacting in and around impact craters of 25 to 100 m in\ndiameter.\nAlso, a similar process has been observed\nto occur at the 500-ton Dial Pack event (ref. 5-7) in\nCanada as a result of the explosive pressurization\nof\nwater-saturated\nsand in a layer well below the floor of\nthe crater produced by the explosion.\nThe other complicating\nfactor in the interpretation\nof the valley floor is the great thickness of coherent\nregolithic breccias at Van Serg Crater relative to other\nportions of the valley. This thickness may be related\nto the position of Van Serg Crater on superposed\nejecta\nblankets\nfrom\nCochise\nand\nShakespeare\nCraters. Also, the apparently\nrapid degradation\nof the\nVan Serg-type\nmatrix-rich\nbreccias in the valley\n\nfield evidence\ndescribed\npreviously,\nthe following\ngeneral subsurface sequence, from the surface downward, seems probable for the valley.\n1. An average of 15 to 20 cm of new, very weakly\ncoherent\nregolith on the present dark valley floor\nsurface\n2. An average of 1 to 2 m of mixed basaltic debris\nand orange/black\nglass having generally\nmantling\nrelationships\nto most large craters and boulders\n3.

A relatively thick layer\n(_15 m) of unconsolidated\nmaterial\noverlies the\nsubfloor basalt; this debris consists largely of finely\ncomminuted\nmaterial typical of the lunar regolith.\nThe surface material over much of the Taurus-\n\nThe Apollo 17 lunar module (LM) landed on the\nflat floor of a deep narrow valley that embays the\nmountainous\nhighlands\nat the eastern rim of the\nSerenitatis basin. Serenitatis, the site of a pronounced\nmascon, is one of the major multi-ringed\nbasins on\nthe near side of the Moon. The Taurus-Littrow\nvalley,\nwhich is radial to the Serenitatis basin, is interpreted\nas a deep graben formed by structural adjustment\nof\nlunar crustal material to the Serenitatis impact.\nDuring their stay on the lunar surface, the Apollo\n17 crew traversed a total of _30 km, collected nearly\n120 kg of rocks and soft, and took more than 2200\nphotographs.\nTheir traverses, sampling, direct observations, and photographs\nspan the full width of the\nTaurus-Littrow\nvalley.\nThe highlands\nsurrounding\nthe valley can be\ndivided on the basis of morphology\ninto (1) high\nsmooth massifs; (2) smaller, closely spaced domical\nhills referred\nto as the Sculptured\nHills; and (3)\nmaterials of low hills adjacent to the massifs and the\nSculptured\nHills. Boulders that had rolled down the\nslopes of the massifs north and south of the valley\nprovided\nsamples of that area. These boulders\nare\ncomposed\nof complex\nbreccias that are generally\nsimilar to those returned from the Apollo 15 and 16\nmissions.\n\nLittrow region has a very low albedo and was believed\nto be a thin young mantle, possibly pyroclastic,\nthat\ncovered the valley floor and parts of the adjacent\nhighlands. No clear evidence of the existence of such\na mantle as a discrete\nlayered\nunit has yet been\nfound, but it may be mixed in with the more typical\ndebris of the lunar regolith. An unusual bright deposit\nextends across the valley floor from the foot of the\nSouth Massif. This deposit\nto those of the massif\navalanche generated on the\nSouth Massif materials\n\nconsists of breccias similar\nand is interpreted\nas an\nmassif slopes.\nwere collected from three\n\nbreccia boulders that were probably\nderived from a\nblocky area near the top of the massif where a\nblue-gray unit overlying tan-gray material is exposed.\nBoulder 1, sampled at station 2, is a foliated and\nlayered breccia, the only one of its type seen by the\ncrew. The four samples collected from boulder 1 are\nbreccias composed\nof dark-gray\nfine-grained\nlithic\nclasts in a light-gray friable matrix.\nBoulder\n2, sampled\nat the South Massif, is a\nfractured\nrock from which five samples of vuggy,\nannealed,\ngreenish-gray\nbreccia\nwere collected.\nA\nbreccia clast and its host were sampled from boulder\n3 at the South Massif. The clast is light-greenish-gray\nbreccia with abundant mineral clasts and sparse lithic\nclasts. The matrix of the clast consists largely of\nangular fragments\nof a mafic silicate embedded in a\nvery-fine-grained\ngroundmass.\nThe host material is a\nblue-gray breccia with scattered vesicles.\n\nMaterials of the valley fill were sampled at many\nstations.

The\nstation 6 boulder, which broke into five pieces, is at\nthe lower end of a boulder\ntrack\nthe apparent\nbeginning of which is in an area of light boulders\napproximately\none-third\nof the way up the massif.\nPhotographs\nusing the 500-mm lens demonstrate\nthat\ndark boulders are abundant higher on the mountain,\nand light boulders\noccur again in the upper part.\nThus, there may be a layer or lenses of darker rock\nhigh on the mountain\nwith lighter rocks both above\nand below. The source of the station 7 boulder on the\nNorth Massif is unknown,\nbut the boulder contains\nrock types like those of the station 6 boulders.\nFour of the five large pieces of the station 6\nboulder were sampled. The boulder consists of two\nmajor breccia types,\ngreenish-gray\nand blue-gray.\nThey are in contact in a 0.5-re-wide zone that appears\nto be an area of mixing between the two rock types.\nThe greenish-gray breccia is tough and annealed, with\nsparse\nlithic and mineral\nclasts set in a vuggy\nfine-grained matrix.\nSamples of blue-gray\nbreccia from the station 6\nboulder contain a high proportion\n(40 to 60 percent)\nof blue-gray breccia fragments\nin a vuggy greenishgray matrix. The matrix is a tough, finely crystalline\nmaterial.\nLarge friable inclusions ranging from 1 cm\nto 1 m across are in sharp irregular contact with the\nblue-gray\nbreccia.\nSamples\nof one of these are\nvery-light-gray cataclasites.\nThe station\n6 boulder\nis intricately\nsheared.\nComparison\nwith the oriented\nreturned\nsamples\nshows that movement along some of the shear planes\nhas deformed the clasts. Major events recorded in the\nstation 6 boulder are the formation\nof the light\ncataclasite, its incorporation\nin the blue-gray breccia,\nand subsequent\nenclosure of the blue-gray breccia in\nthe greenish-gray breccia.\nThe station 7 boulder is similar to the station 6\nboulder\n\nin that\n\nthe two\n\nmajor\n\nrock types,\n\ngreenish-\n\ngray breccia and blue-gray\nbreccia, are present. A\nlarge white clast (1.5 by 0.5 m), similar to those in\nthe station\n6 boulder,\nis penetrated\nby narrow\nblue-gray breccia dikes. The blue-gray breccia is in\nsharp irregular contact with the younger greenish-gray\nbreccia.\nLike the station 6 boulder,\nthe station 7\nboulder is intricately fractured.\nAt least two fracture\nsets are confined\nto the large white cataclasite\ninclusion\n\nand the blue-gray\n\nbreccia.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nSmaller chips collected at stations 6 and 7 include\nthe major rock types of the two large boulders, as\nwell as a few other breccia types, one coarse-grained\ngabbroic\nrock, and one light-colored\nfine-grained\nhornfels.\nA few basalt fragments\nthat are probable\nejecta from the valley floor were also collected.\nThe South Massif boulders\nmost probably came\nfrom the highest part of the massif (boulder 1, station\n2, from the blue-gray unit; boulder 2, station 2, from\nthe underlying tan-gray unit), and the station 6 and 7\nboulders probably came from within the lower third\nof the North Massif. Hence, two different\nstratigraphic intervals may have been sampled. Conversely,\nthe lithologies of the South Massif boulders closely\nresemble those of the North Massif boulders in many\nrespects.\nThe similarity\nseen in early examination\nsuggests the possibility\nthat only one stratigraphic\nunit is represented.\nWhichever the case, the massifs\nare composed of intensely shocked breccias reasonably interpreted\nbasins.\n\nas ejecta\n\nfrom\n\nancient\n\nlarge impact\n\nOn the accessible\npart of the Sculptured\nHills,\nhand-sized\nsamples are essentially\nabsent,\nand no\nboulders that clearly represent Sculptured\nHills bedrock were found. Small fragments of basalt, probably\nejected from the valley floor, and regolith breccia\ndominate the samples, which consist mainly of chips\ncollected\nwith soils or by raking. Samples of friable\nfeldspathic breccia from the wall of a 15-m crater and\nof a glass-covered\ngabbroic\nboulder that is almost\ncertainly\nexotic were also collected.\nThe greater\ndissection, lower slopes, lack of large boulders,\nand\nlimited sample suite suggest that the Sculptured Hills\nmay be underlain by less coherent breccias than the\nmassifs.\nSubsequent\nto the formation\nof the TaurusLittrow graben by the Serenitatis impact, the valley\nfloor was inundated\nand leveled by basaltic\nlava\nflows. Geophysical\nevidence (secs. 10 and 13)suggests that the prism of basalt filling the valley is more\nthan a kilometer\nthick. The uppermost\n130 m was\nsampled in the ejecta of craters on the valley floor.\nIn general, the subfloor basalt blocks seen at the\nlanding site were not visibly shocked or even intensely\nfractured.\nIn some rocks, planar partings\nparallel bands expressed as differing concentrations\nof\nvesicles. Almost all returned smnples of basalt can be\ndivided into five classes: (1) vesicular, porphyritic,\ncoarse-grained\nbasalts;\n(2) vesicular\ncoarse-grained\nbasalts; (3) vesicular fine-grained\nbasalts; (4) dense\n\nPRELIMINARY\nGEOLOGIC\nINVESTIGATION\naphanitic basalts; and (5) vesicular aphanitic basalts.\nBefore final accumulation\nof the Serenitatis mare\nfill, broad arching east of the Serenitatis basin tilted\nthe subfloor lavas to the east, forming the present 1\xc2\xb0\neastward tilt of the valley floor. The subfloor basalt is\noverlain by fra_nental\ndebris _15 m thick. For the\nmost part, this is impact-generated\nregolith similar to\nthat developed\non mare basalts elsewhere\non the\nMoon. The central cluster ejecta, the light mantle,\nand the ejecta of Shorty and Van Serg Craters are\ndiscrete deposits recognized within the regolith.\nThe lower part of the regolith is thought to be\nrepresented\nin the abundant\ndark friable breccias in\nthe ejecta of the 90-m-diameter\nVan Serg Crater. The\nbreccias contain scattered, light-colored lithic clasts as\nwell as abundant\ndark glass, mineral\nand lithic\nfragments derived from basalts, and variable percentages of orange glass spheres and fragments.\nThey are\ninterpreted\nto be regolith\nbreccias indurated\nand\nexcavated from the deeper, older part of the regolith\nby the Van Serg impact. Basalt bedrock is not known\nto have been excavated by Van Serg.\nThe central\ncluster ejecta is derived from the\ncluster of craters south and east of the LM. It is\ndistinguished\nby the abundance\nof blocks in the unit,\nand the unit is too young for the blocks to have been\nreduced much in size by later impacts. All sampled\nblocks in the central cluster ejecta are subfloor basalt.\nThe young pyroclastic\ndark mantle\nanticipated\nbefore the mission was not recognized in the traverse\narea as a discrete surface layer. Strong photogeologic\nevidence for the existence\nof such a mantle on the\nvalley floor and in parts of the highlands still exists.\nAlbedo measurements\nshow that abnormal\nsurface\ndarkening,\nconsistent\nwith the concept of the introduction of exotic dark material-the\n"dark mantle"increases to the east and south in the Taurus-Littrow\narea. If the dark mantle is younger than the central\ncluster ejecta, it must be so thin in the landing site\nthat it is thoroughly\nintermixed\nwith the younger\npart of the regolith. Such mixed dark mantle may be\nrepresented\nby the dark glass spheres that abound in\nthe soils of the valley floor. An alternative hypothesis\nis that the dark mantle may have accumulated\nshortly\nafter the extrusion of the subfloor basalt. In this case,\nthe deposit would be intimately\nmixed with subsequently formed regolith.\nThe light mantle is an unusual\ndeposit of highalbedo\nmaterial\nwith finger-like\nprojections\nthat\nextend\n6 km across dark plains from the South\n\nOF THE LANDING\n\nSITE\n\n6-3\n\nMassif. Rock fragments\ncollected\nfrom the light\nmantle are similar in lithology to the breccias of the\nSouth Massif. This similarity supports the hypothesis\nthat the light mantle is an avalanche deposit formed\nfrom loose materials on the face of the South Massif.\nA cluster of secondary\ncraters on the top of the\nSouth Massif may record\nthe impact\nevent that\ninitiated the avalanche.\nSize-frequency\ndistribution\nand morphologies\nof craters on the light mantle\nsuggest that its age is comparable\nto that of Tycho\nCrater, on the order of 100 million years.\nShorty is a 110-m-diameter\nimpact crater penetrating the light mantle. Unusual orange soil was identified in two places on the rim of Shorty Crater and in\nthe ejecta from a small crater on the inner wall. A\ntrench on the crater rim exposed an 80-cm-wide zone\nof orange soil, now known\nto consist largely of\norange glass spheres. A double\ndrive tube sample\nshowed that the orange soil overlies black fine-grained\nmaterial (now known\nto consist of tiny, opaque,\nblack spheres) at a depth of _ 25 cm. The old age for\nthe orange glass material implies solidification\nshortly\nafter the period of subfloor\nbasalt volcanism.\nThe\nblack and orange glass material, whatever its origin,\nmust have been present in the Shorty target area; it\nwas excavated or mobilized by the Shorty impact.\nFine-grained\nsoil, darker than the underlying\nunconsolidated\ndebris, was recognized at the surface at\nShorty Crater,\nat Van Serg Crater,\non the light\nmantle, and on the massif talus. The soil is thin (e.g.,\n0.5 cm at Shorty, _ 7 cm on the flank of Van Serg)\nand probably represents the regolith that has formed\non these young ejecta or talus surfaces. Relatively\nyoung structural\ndeformation\nin the landing area is\nrecorded by the Lee-Lincoln Scarp and by small fresh\ngrabens that trend northwest\nacross the light mantle.\nThe sharp knickpoint\nat the base of the massifs may\nindicate that some fairly recent uplift of the massifs\nhas kept the talus slopes active.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nPremission\n\nGeologic\n\nStudies\n\nThe Taurus-Littrow\nregion lies on the southeastern\nrim of the Serenitatis\nbasin (fig. 6-1) in an area of\nmountains,\nlow hills, and plains.

The walls of the valley rise 2000 m above the\nfloor. The valley is interpreted as a deep graben\nformed at the time of the Serenitatis impact.\nThe highlands surrounding the valley can be\ndivided on the basis of morphology into (1) high\nsmooth massifs, ( 2 ) smaller, closely spaced domical\nhills referred to as the Sculptured Hills, and (3) low\nhills adjacent to the massifs and the Sculptured Hills\n(refs. 6-1 and 6-2). The highlands were interpreted in\npremission studies as deposits of ejecta derived from\nsurrounding basins with major uplift occurring in the\nSerenitatis event. A possible volcanic origin was also\nconsidered but thought to be less likely (ref. 6-1).\nThe reason for the morphologic difference between\nthe massifs and the Sculptured Hills was not clear;\n\npossibly, the difference reflects different responses to\nthe Serenitatis event and t o later tectonic forces. The\nlow hills unit was considered to be downfaulted and\npartly buried blocks of massif or Sculptured Hills\nmaterial.\nThe nearly level valley floor was apparently\nformed by deep filling of the graben by fluid\nplains-forming material (subfloor unit). The material\nat the surface of much of the Taurus-Littrow region\nhas a very low albedo and was believed to be a thin\nmantle, possibly pyroclastic, that covered the valley\nfloor and parts of the adjacent highlands. Overlap\nrelations with the typical mare material of Mare\nSerenitatis and an apparent deficiency of small craters\nindicated that the dark mantle might be very young\nin the lunar geologic time scale (refs. 6-1 and 6-3).\n\nPRELIMINARY\nGEOLOGIC\n\nINVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough\nquantitatively\na minor deposit, its significance lay in its apparent\nyoung age and presumed\nvolcanic origin. No volcanic rocks younger than 3.1\nbillion years had been returned before the Apollo 17\nmission.\nSimilar\ndark mantling\ndeposits occur in\nrelatively small tracts on the southwestern\nrim of the\nSerenitatis\nbasin, at the outer edge of several other\ncircular maria (ref. 6-4), and in other isolated patches\non the lunar near side.\nA contrasting\nunit of bright mantling\nmaterial\noccurs in a limited area of the valley. This unusual\ndeposit extends from the southern wall of the valley\nnortheastward\nin finger-like\nextensions\nacross the\ndark valley floor. The material was interpreted\nas an\navalanche from the steep slope of the South Massif\n(ref. 6-3).\n\nGeologic\n\nObjectives\n\nand General\n\nResults\n\nThe geologic objectives of the Apollo 17 mission\nmay be divided into orbital and lunar surface data\ncollection.\nThe orbital\nobjectives\nin the TaurusLittrow area were to add to the knowledge of the\nregional geology of the site through\ndirect visual\nobservation and photographs\nand to assist in locating\nthe LM on the surface. Additional\naid in traverse\nlocation\nby panoramic\ncamera photographs\nof the\nlunar roving vehicle (LRV) tracks and crew-disturbed\nareas was anticipated.\nThe principal objectives of the\nground crew were to deploy the Apollo lunar surface\nexperiments\npackage (ALSEP) and the surface electrical properties\n(SEP) experiment;\nto record gravity\ndata on the traverse gravimeter; to describe the kinds\nand proportions\nof rocks in the various map units and\nto collect samples of them; to observe, describe, and\ncollect samples of regolith and dark mantle that were\nthought\nto cover most of these units; to look for\noutcrop and, if found, to describe, photograph,\nand\nsample\nit; to describe structures,\nincluding\nlineaments, layers, and faults, in various units; and to\nobserve and describe, where possible, the attitudes of\nand contacts between the major geologic units.\nIn detail, ground objectives were planned around\ngroups\nof stations\nwith the potential\nof yielding\nvaried\ngeologic information\n(fig. 6-2). The prime\nsampling areas of the massif and Sculptured\nHills\nunits were located in the station 2, 6 and 7, and 8\nareas, as well as between\nstations 2 and 4, on the\nassumption\nthat the light mantle unit was composed\nof materials\nderived from the South Massif. This\n\nOF THE LANDING\n\nSITE\n\n6-5\n\nbroad station coverage was designed to yield maximum information\nabout\nthe lateral continuity\nof\nmassif lithologies.\nThe principal sampling areas for\nvalley materials were planned at stations\n1, 4, 5, 9,\nand 10B. This coverage was designed to allow detailed\nstratigraphic\nstudies of both the dark mantle and the\nsubfloor unit. Craters that were to be visited on the\nvalley floor potentially\noffered samples of subfloor\nmaterial from depths as great as 150 m. Regolith was,\nof course, expected throughout\nthe traversed regions,\nbut an unusually\nsmall thickness\nwas anticipated\nbecause of the low crater density on the dark and\nlight mantle units.\nBoulders that had rolled down the slopes of the\nmassifs north\nand south\nof the valley provided\nsamples of that area. These boulders are composed of\ncomplex breccias; their general similarity to breccias\nreturned\nfrom the Apollo\n15 and 16 missions\nindicates\nthat they are very ancient materials\nas\nanticipated.\nTheir relation to the circular basins on\nthe lunar near side is discussed subsequently.\nCrew\nobservations\nand photographic\nevidence suggest that\nthe materials of the massifs are layered and that at\nleast two separate layers were sampled.\nMaterials\nof the valley fill were sampled\nat\nnumerous\nstations around the LM and en route to\nand from the massifs. Ejecta around many craters on\nthe valley floor consists of basalt, confirming\nthat\nvolcanic materials underlie the Taurus-Littrow\nvalley\nfloor.\nA relatively\ndeep layer\nmaterial\noverlies\nthe subfloor\n\nof unconsolidated\nbasalt;\nthis debris\n\nconsists of finely comminuted\nmaterial typical of the\nlunar regolith. It may also contain the dark mantle\nmapped in premission studies.

A fairly well-developed set of\ncleavage planes (sb in fig. 6-8) that are roughly at\nright angles to the bedding planes is visible across the\nmiddle of the boulder, and a similar set with the same\norientation occurs in sample 72255. These are probably shear planes. The eroded nature of the boulder\nand the well-developed fillet on its uphill side suggest\nthat it has been in its present position for a\nconsiderable period of time.\nFour samples (72215, 72235, 72255, and 72275)\n\nwere taken from boulder 1 (fig. 6-8). All samples are\nbreccias with light-gray friable matrices (called tan\nbreccia by the crew) containing dark-gray fine-grained\nlithic clasts.

Sample locations are designated on boulder\nfragments.\n\nThese boulder concentrations\nare probably\nderived\nfrom near-surface\nbedrock.\nAt lower elevations, the\nbedrock in the massif is covered by a thick regolith\nand talus cover. At higher elevations,\nthe massif is\ncovered by a much thinner layer of fine material that\nallows the underlying\nbedrock to be easily excavated\nby the more abundant smaller cratering events. This is\nsuggested by the change in slope from 25 \xc2\xb0 in the\nupper two-thirds\n(upper\n1000 m) of the massif to\n21.5 \xc2\xb0 in the lower one-third of the massif (_ 500 m\nabove the base). One boulder track visible in figure\n6-16 extends nearly 1000 m up the slope. At the\nlower end of this track is a large boulder\nthat is\ndarker than most of the other boulders on the lower\none-third\nof the massif (fig. 6-17) and that is also\ndarker than the station 6 boulders. A concentration\nof dark boulders occurs near its apparent source, and\nsimilar concentrations\nare scattered at approximately\nthe same level elsewhere on the mountain face. Thus,\n\nlight\n\nzone\n\nwas sampled\n\nat the station\n\n6\n\nThe station 6 boulder broke into five pieces that\nare alined downslope.\nThe largest is _ 8 m across. The\noriginal boulder can be pieced back together, generally with only a small amount of rotation of any of\n*.he blocks. Several large fragments\nthat may have\nbroken from the boulder as it rolled downhill can be\nseen in and around the boulder track (fig. 6-18).\nBoulders\n4 and 5 can be reassembled\nby minor\nrotation until similar appearing faces fit together (fig.\n6-19). When this is done, vesicle foliation\nis in a\nsimilar orientation\nin each boulder, and nonvesicular\ninclusions in both pieces also fit across the break.\nBoulders 1 and 2 also fit without substantial manipulation. It appears that boulder 1 can be raised and\nplaced against boulder 2 (fig. 6-20). Boulders 2 and 3\nare fitted together\nin much the same manner (fig.\n6-21). The relationship\nof the structural split between\nboulders 1, 2, and 3 and boulders 4 and 5 is not as\nobvious, and the fit is still tentative.\nFigure 6-21\nshows a nearly planar surface (A) on boulder 2, which\ndips approximately\nthe same as the north face of\nboulder 4, as shown in figure 6-19. When boulder 4 is\nplaced on this surface, the foliation, which appears to\nbe planar concentrations\nof vesicles in boulder 2, is\nparallel with the foliation in boulders 4 and 5. Also, a\nseries of widely spaced joints in boulder 4 is then\nalined with similar joints in boulder\n2. A second,\nless-likely possibility\nis to place the north face of\nboulder 4 on planar\nsurface\n(B) on boulder\n2,\nadjacent to the one just described (fig. 6-13). However, structures seen in both boulders do not aline as\nwell, and the shape of the fractured face of boulder\ndoes not conform well with that of boulder 4.\n\n2\n\nFour of the five numbered boulder fragments were\nsampled. Two major breccia types can be distinguished: greenish-gray\nand blue-gray\nbreccias. The\nthird, fourth, and fifth boulders\nand part of the\nsecond are greenish-gray\nbreccias, described by the\ncrew as anorthositic\ngabbros. In boulder 2, there is an\nirregular contact between\nthe greenish-gray\nbreccia\nand a blue-gray breccia. This zone, _. 50 cm across,\nappears to be an area of mixing between the two rock\ntypes. Boulder 1 is also blue-gray breccia.\nTwo samples were collected from the greenish-gray\nbreccia.

These rocks are tough annealed\nbreccias with sparse lithic and mineral clasts set in a\nvuggy fine-grained matrix. The vugs, which range in\nsize from 0.1 mm to 9 cm, are flattened and locally\ndined. Around the larger cavities, the sugary intergrowth of minerals that forms the matrices of these\nrocks gradually coarsens over a distance of = 1 cm.\nAt cavity walls, individual minerals of the matrix\nbecome distinguishable, and the rock has a poikiloblastic texture.

The dense area is sharply bounded by\nvuggy breccia on two sides and grades into it on a\nthird side. This area may be an inclusion that was\nincorporated in the greenish-gray breccia, which\nvesiculated along the margins, or a locally nonvesiculated interior of the boulder. The former is preferred\nbecause of the sharpness of the contact on two sides.\nA set of planar structures occurs within the dense\nmaterial parallel to the fracture face between boulders 4 and 5. It is not clear what these structures are,\nbut they do not appear to be compositional layers.\nThey do not continue into the vuggy part of the\nboulder, which further suggests that the nonvesicular\nrock is an inclusion rather than a central nonvesiculated core of the boulder.\nTwo samples from the blue-gray part of boulder 1\n\nFIGURE 6-17.-View of the North Massif showing principal\nelevation data on prominent boulder tracks.

Arrows indicate probable matchpoints between\nboulders (AS 17-140-21497).\n\n(fig. 6-23) (samples 76275 and 76295) are composed\nlargely of blue-gray breccia clasts in vuggy greenishgray matrices. The proportion of clasts in these two\nsamples is high (40 to 60 percent), and the matrix is\nsomewhat browner and darker than the typical vuggy\ngreenish-gray rocks. Vugs, which are = 2 to 5 mm\nacross, are in most cases lined by rich-brown pyroxene and plagioclase with or without ilmenite plates.\nThe matrices of these samples are tough, finely\ncrystalline material composed principally of angular\nmineral debris (plagioclase, yellow-green mineral,\nbrown pyroxene) and small lithic fragments of bluegray breccia. The clasts are dominantly fine crystal-\n\nline blue-gray breccias that contain sparse finely\nrecrystallized light-gray clasts.\nIn the blue-gray breccia of boulder 1, there are\nlight-gray friable inclusions ranging in size from 1 t o 2\ncm to 1 m across that are in sharp irregular contact\nwith the blue-gray breccia. Eight small samples\n(76235 to 76239 and 76305 to 76307) are chips that\nrepresent one of these inclusions (fig. 6-24). These\nsamples are very light-gray cataclasites composed of\nangular mineral debris that includes yellow-green and\npale-grass-green mafic silicates and plagioclase.\nTwo other types of inclusions in the blue-gray\nbreccia were not sampled.

A second type, which is rare, is\nmedium gray and vesicular with sharp irregular\nboundaries (fig. 6-23, upper left).\nOne sample (76255, collected from boulder 1 ) is a\nbreccia that contains clasts of blue-gray set in a\nfriable light-gray to brownish-gray matrix. The sample\n\nis prominently foliated, with alternating layers of\nabundant or sparse blue-gray breccia clasts. The\nblue-gray breccia clasts contain sparse, sugary, white\nhornfels clasts and moderately abundant mafic silicate fragments. The largest blue-gray clast in the rock\nhas a string of vuggy patches 3 to 12 mm across of\nplagioclase and rich-brown pyroxene along one edge.\nSample 76315, collected from boulder 2 near the\ncontact, appears to be transitional between blue-gray\nbreccia and the type represented by sample 76255.\nThe rock is mainly blue-gray breccia with a few white\nclasts; a large (3 by 8 cm) white clast at one end of\nthe specimen is veined by blue-gray material. Both\ncomponents were subsequently weakly brecciated so\nthat pieces of blue-gray rock are now encased in a\nwhite matrix.\nIn boulder 1, several throughgoing planes (Sa\nthrough Sg) can be recognized in stereoscopic study\nof the photographs (figs. 6-23 and 6-25). The\nlettering sequence does not imply a sequence of\ndevelopment in the rocks. When comparing these\nplanes with the oriented returned samples, it can be\nseen that they represent shear planes along some of\nwhich movement has occurred. Two types are evident. Along the Sa plane, shearing has deformed the\nclasts to create discontinuous compositional banding.\nThe zoning in sample 76255 is parallel to the Sa\nshears. This type shear is closely spaced (a few\ncentimenters or less), but it is not a plane that had\nany substantial control over the shape of the boulder\nbecause the fracture surfaces are discontinuous and\nthe rock is coherent across these surfaces. Planes S,\nand sf are also this type. Planes sc and s d are typical\nof the second type; they appear to be somewhat more\nwidely spaced planes that form fracture faces on the\nsurface of the boulder. Sample 76295 parted along s d\nwhen sampled. Planes Se and S, are also this type.\nMost of the shears appear to penetrate the boulder.\nPlanes Sa and s b , for example, can be seen in two\nplaces on the boulder over a meter apart.\nThroughout the boulder, movement along the\nshears does not appear to have been uniform. In the\narea where sample 76255 was collected, one of the\nlarge light-gray clasts has been intensively sheared.\nThe large clast from which samples 76235 to 76239\nand 76305 to 76307 were collected has not been\nsubstantially deformed. The direction of shearing is\nthe same in two areas, but the amount of movement\nis different. Two fracture sets (A and B in fig. 6-23),\nwhich have not been identified in the samples, are\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATION OF THE LANDING SITE\n\n6-23\n\nFIGURE 6-23.-Locations of samples removed from boulder 1 at station 6.

Sample 76315,\ncollected near the contact in boulder 2, shows some\nevidence of shearing. In figure 6-26, the face shown\non boulder 2 is parallel with the Sc structures of\nboulder 1. Figure 6-27 shows this face, together with\nwhat is probably an expression of the s d planes. The\nother structures are probably in this boulder also;\nbut, because of the lower resolution and the direction\nfrom which this photograph was taken, they are not\nvisible. It does not appear that the Sc planes\npenetrate boulder 2 completely. They appear to die\n\nout as the contact between the two breccia types is\napproached. Assuming that the boulders have been\nreassembled correctly, it is not evident that these\nshears are present in the greenish-gray breccia. Some\nplanar structures can be seen on boulders 4 and 5, but\nthey neither coincide with nor look the same as the\nshear planes seen in boulders .1 and 2. They are\ngenerally spaced several centimeters apart and appear\nto be fractures rather than the shear planes. No\nevidence of shearing is seen in samples 76015 and\n76215 collected from these boulders.\nOne of the first events represented in the station 6\nboulder was the formation of the light-gray to white\ncataclasite. This breccia was enclosed by the blue-gray\n\n6-24\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMTNARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nFIGURE 6-24.-Large light-pay clast in blue-gray breccia of boulder 1 at station 6 .

The blue-gray\nbreccia was heated enough to allow minor vesiculation. The blue-gray breccia was then incorporated by\nthe greenish-gray breccia, which must have been\nheated enough to allow intensive vesiculation. The\n\nvesicles define a foliation parallel to the contact with\nthe blue-gray breccia. The shearing seen in the\nblue-gray breccia portion of the boulder, which\ncaused the banding seen in sample 76255, apparently\noccurred before and/or during its incorporation into\nthe greenish-gray breccia, because no extension of\nthese shears is evident in the greenish-gray breccia.\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATION OF THE LANDING SITE\n\n6-25\n\nFIGURE 6-25.-View of boulder 1 at station 6 after removal of samples; shows shear sets, Sa through\nS,.

Note\nthe large fracture face of blue-gray breccia with light-gray clasts (AS17-140-21456).\n\nThe blue-gray breccia may, however, be more susceptible to shearing than the greenish-gray breccia.\nIt is not clear whether the vesicular patch seen ir\nboulder 1 is of the same generation as the greenishgray breccia because its relation to the contact cannot\nbe seen in three dimensions. The color and vesicularity of it suggest that it is the same; however, it is\n\nnot known if the vesicular patch was injected into the\nblue-gray zone during this time.\n\nStation 7 Boulder\nSampling in the station 7 area consisted of\ncollecting four samples from a 3-m boulder (fig. 6-28)\n\n6-26\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n-\n\nt\n\nFIGURE 6-26.-Similar shear surfaces 6,) boulders 1 and\non\n2 at station 6 (AS17-141-21633).\n\n..\nI\n\nmate sCal& m\n\n\'\n\n-\n\n+\n\nFIGURE 6-28.-Boulder sampled at station 7.

The boulder is similar to the station 6\nboulder in that the two major rock types, greenishgray breccia and blue-gray breccia, are present. A 1.5by 0.5-m white clast, similar to those seen at station\n6, is penetrated by blue-gray breccia dikes that are 2\nto 3 cm across.\nOne sample (77135) was collected from the\ngreenish-gray breccia (fig. 6-29). Sample 77135,\nwhich most likely represents the youngest matrix of\nthe boulder, is a vuggy greenish-gray breccia. The\ncavities in this rock range from = 0.1 to 10 mm in\ndiameter and range from irregular vugs to nearly\nspherical, smooth-walled vesicles. The contact between the blue-gray breccia and the greenish-gray\nbreccia is a sharp irregular boundary. Sample 771 15\nmay contain the contact between vuggy greenish-gray\nbreccia and blue-gray breccia. However, the greenish-\n\nI\n\nL\n\nFIGURE 6-29.-Dashed line indicates point of contact\nbetween greenish-gray breccia and blue-gray breccia on\nstation 7 boulder (AS17-146-22338).\n\ngray part of the sample differs from sample 77135 in\nthat it contains a very high proportion of honeybrown and yellow-green mineral debris and scattered,\nlarge, distinctive clasts of a dark-gray mineral. The\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATION OF THE LANDING SITE\ngreenish-gray material appears to invade the blue-gray\nbreccia, but clast-matrix relationships in the rock are\nnot clearly evident.\nThe 1.5- by 0.5-m white inclusion is cut by several\nsmall dikes of blue-gray breccia. Samples 77075 to\n77077 and 77215 represent the white clast and the\nblue-gray dike that cuts through the clast (fig. 6-30).\nSample 77215 is a friable white cataclasite composed\nof approximately equal proportions of pale-yellow\nmafic silicate and plagioclase. The cataclasite is cut by\n\n77075 to 77077\n\n6-27\n\nan irregular network of dark-gray fine-grained veins.\nThe vein-cataclasite complex was weakly brecciated\nto isolate small pieces of the vein in the white matrix.\nAt least two well-developed fracture sets visible in\nthe boulder seem to be confined to the blue-gray\nbreccia and the white clast within it. A strongly\ndeveloped set of fractures is essentially parallel with\nthe bottom of the rock. A second less-well-developed\nset, which appears to be a conjugate set, dips = 45"\nto the east. The fracture sets are spaced a few\ncentimeters apart in the blue-gray breccia (fig. 6-3 1)\nand become very closely spaced (1 cm or less) in the\nwhite clast (fig. 6-32), indicating its comparative\nbrittleness. These fracture sets are not seen in the\ngreenish-gray breccia, which suggests that the fracturing occurred in the blue-gray breccia before its\nincorporation in the greenish-gray breccia. Foliation\nof the vesicles in the greenish-gray breccia is parallel\nto the contact with the blue-gray breccia. The\nfracturing occurred after incorporation of the white\nclast, because the dikelets of blue-gray seen in it do\nnot parallel the fracture sets but are cut by them. As\nin the station 6 boulder, the youngest event is\nrepresented by the greenish-gray breccia and the\noldest by the large white clast in the blue-gray\nbreccia.\nAlthough there is no visible boulder track, there is\nlittle doubt that the station 7 boulder was derived\nfrom the North Massif because of its similarity in\ncomposition and structure to other materials collected from the massif. Because it is considerably\nsmaller than the station 6 boulder, it probably\nbounded downslope (as did those of comparable size\non the South Massif (fig. 6-6)) rather than rolled. It\nappears that the boulder has been in its present\nposition for only a short while because only a small\nfillet is developed on the upslope side.\n\nOther Samples Collected at Stations 6 and 7\n\ni\n\nI\nI\n\n0\n\nI\n\nI\n\n.5\n1.0\nApproximate scale, rn\n\n,\n\nI\n\n1.5\n\nIb)\nFIGURE 6-30.-Station 7 boulder showing dikes of blue-gray\nbreccia in light-gray clast within blue-gray breccia.

The\ncataclasites are chalky white rocks, but 77017 is laced\nby dark glass veins and one side is covered by a\nthick coating of dark glass with many inclusions of\ncataclasite. The greenish-gray breccias include two\nlarge rocks (76055 and 77035) with irregularly\ndistributed small slit-like cavities that are locally\nalined. A smaller sample grouped with the greenishgray breccias (77517) and two small pieces (77525\nand 77526) that may have been broken from it have\nabundant medium light-gray to light-blue-gray aphanitic clasts in a vug-free, annealed, light-gray matrix.\nSample 76035 is an unusual blue-gray breccia that\ncontains a shattered clast of light-gray hornfels.\n\n6-29\n\nBlue-gray matrix completely envelops pieces of the\nbroken clast around its periphery, but the interior of\nthe clast is incompletely penetrated by blue-gray\nmatrix so that the fragments form a porous aggregate.\nThe blue-gray matrix appears to be holocrystalline\nand fine grained and has a small proportion of\nsmooth-walled vesicles and irregular vugs. Other clasts\nin the blue-gray matrix include a distinctive fragment\nthat consists of 2-mm euhedral plagioclase crystals,\ninterstitial light-brown pyroxene, annealed plagioclase-rich fragments, and mineral debris.\nSeveral basalts were collected in the rake and grab\nsamples at these two stations: four vesicular, porphyritic, coarse-grained basalts (76037, 76538, 77535,\nand 77536); two vesicular fine-grained basalts (76136\nand 77516); and two dense aphanitic basalts (76537\nand 76539). The presence of the basalts indicates\nthere is some mixing of subfloor materials in the talus\nof the massif material. This area is also down range\nfrom the central crater cluster that dominates the\nlanding area and that probably threw debris onto the\nslopes of the North Massif and adjacent Sculptured\nHills.\n\nScu I ptu red HiI Is\nThe single location on the Sculptured Hills from\nwhich samples were collected (station 8) lies x 20 m\nabove the valley floor on a southwest-facing slope just\nsoutheast of Wessex Cleft and 4 km northeast of the\nlanding point. The station is within the zone mapped\nas dark mantle (refs. 6-1 and 6-5). This unit locally\nmantles the lower slopes and linear valleys of the\nSculptured Hills (fig. 6-34) and is likely to have been\nmixed with the underlying regolith. The terrain is\nundulating on a general slope of 10\xe2\x80\x9d to 30\xc2\xb0, being\nsteepest above the station 8 area (figs. 6-35 and 6-36).\nFrom a distance on earlier traverses, the crew\ndescribed these hills as being pockmarked (by small\ncraters), darker gray, more hummocky and lineated,\nand as having lower slopes than the massifs.

Most of the fragments are small clods and\ncreate a downslope pattern of small lineaments\nindicating youthful mass wasting on currently active\nslopes (appendix B, fig. 6-121). However, the three\nboulders investigated on this slope showed no evidence of having moved downslope, and the only\nother large rocks on the hill are described as farther\nupslope. These latter blocks are the fragments visible\nwithin the patches of dark mantle in figure 6-36.\nThe few fragments seen on the local surface are\nsubrounded to subangular; some are partly buried,\nbut the two sampled boulders and most of the soil\nclods are perched on the surface. The lack of blocks\naround fresh craters as large as 50 m in diameter (fig.\n6-36) indicates that bedrock is more than 10 m below\nthe surface slope material. The soil in this area, at\nleast to the 20- to 25-cm depth of the trench samples,\nconsists of fine-grained cohesive clods and particles.\nThe soil has a moderately dark appearance characteristic of the mantle throughout the valley floor.\nNo large craters are present in the immediate area;\nthose as large as several meters in diameter are\ncommon, however, and have a continuum of morphologies from fresh-appearing, topographically sharp\n\nfeatures to highly subdued depressions. The craters\nhave neither prominently raised nor blocky rims,\nalthough one secondary crater lower on the slope (fig.\n6-37) forms a cloddy rim similar to that sampled\nfrom the LRV on the rim of S W Crater (LRV-11,\nfig. 6-34).\nThe sample suite collected at the foot of the\nSculptured Hills is represented mainly by basalts that\nare most likely ejecta deposited on the Sculptured\nHills slopes by valley floor craters and subsequently\nconcentrated by mass wasting toward the base of the\nhills. The samples are all from the subtle dark-gray\napron interpreted on premission maps as dark mantle\n(fig. 6-34).\nOne large basalt fragment (sample 78 135, fig.\n6-38) was taken from near a half-meter-wide boulder,\nprobably also basalt, that was too hard to be sampled\ndirectly. Other basalt fragments were collected in the\nrake and soil samples. The basalts are not obviously\nshocked or glass veined, and the crew indicated the\nbasalts resembled others sampled at different localities on the valley floor.\nPerhaps the more important samples for interpreting the lithologic nature of the Sculptured Hills\nare represented by the smaller rocks and soils.\nUnfortunately, their relationship to the underlying\nhills is not known. The friable feldspathic breccia\n(sample 78155) collected from the wall of a 15-m\ncrater is a particularly good candidate for Sculptured\nHills material. Its friability and color are compatible\nwith the more rounded topography of the Sculptured\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATION OF THE LANDING SITE\n\n0\n\n.5\n\n6-3 1\n\n1\n\nApproximate scale, km\nExplanation\n\n- -- Approximate boundary of dark rubble patch\n---*\nPossible boulder track\n0 Location of large blockls)\nArea of break in slope\n\nFIGURE 6-36.-Telephotogaphic mosaic of Sculptured Hills slope above station 8 as viewed from\nstation 2A.

(78526), one nonvesicular metaclastic rock (78527), and one white feldspathic breccia (785 17).\nThe gabbroic rocks (samples 78235 to 78238,\n78255, and 78256) are from the top and bottom of\nanother half-meter-size boulder. The rock is coarse\ngrained, composed of\n50 percent each of plagioclase and pyroxene, intensely shocked, and heavily\nglass coated and glass veined (figs. 6-39 and 6 4 0 ) . No\nfillet existed on the boulder in its original position.\nThese properties and its strongly fluted, glassy surface\nsuggest that it originated from outside the sample\narea and was emplaced relatively recently at station 8.\n\nThe lack of blocky craters or related boulder tracks\nupslope argues against a local source.\nThe well-documented trench samples (78420 to\n78480) have not been described yet, but they should\ntypify the soils of the lower slopes of the Sculptured\nHills. They are probably a mixture of valley floor\ndebris and Sculptured Hills soils. The soil sample\ncollected from a dark cloddy crater on the rim of\nSWP Crater (78120) at LRV-11 was just at the base\nof the slope and may represent either deeper material\nfrom SWP Crater or mass-wasted material from\nupslope (fig. 6-34). Perhaps the original composition\nof the hills can best be determined by subtracting\nfrom these soils the average composition of the\ntypical valley floor.\n\nRelationships Between the Massifs and the\nScu Iptu red HiIls\nThe upper slopes of the North, South, and East\nMassifs are alike in morphology and outcrop occurrence.

The Sculptured Hills, in\nthis region at least, are notably different in their\ngreater dissection, lower slopes, and lack of large\nboulders. These features in combination with the\nlimited sample suite suggest that the Sculptured Hills\nare underlain by less coherent breccias than the\nmassifs. They do seem to have more slope debris\ndeposited at their base and a greater possibility of\ncontamination from the thinly mantling dark material\nabove and below the sample area. If the Sculptured\nHills reflect a different structural history than the\nmassifs, no evidence was developed during the mission to demonstrate it.\nOutcrops on the North Massif occur on the upper\ntwo-thirds (1000 m) of the slope. On the South\nMassif, only the upper one-third (700 m) of the slope\nhas exposed blocks. Sampled boulders are thought to\nrepresent the uppermost part of the South Massif and\nthe lower one-third of the North Massif. Hence, two\ndistinct stratigraphic levels may have been sampled.\nHowever, rocks collected from the North and\nSouth Massifs closely resemble each other in many\nrespects.\n1. Vuggy greenish-gray breccias from both massifs\nare similar except that cavities in rock samples from\nstation 2 are smaller than those from station 6 .\n\n2. Greenish-gray breccias that lack cavities occur\non both massifs.\n3. Blue-gray breccias are identical, at least insofar\nas can be determined with the binocular microscope.\nIn both places, these rocks have small proportions of\nwhite clasts and have fine-grained to aphanitic\nmatrices.\n4. Light-gray breccias from both massifs are also\nsimilar; although, as a class, these rocks are variable.\nThe characteristics of friable matrices, dominance of\ndark- over light-colored clasts, and local Occurrences\nof foliation are shared by samples from both massifs.\nSubordinate features of the breccias are also similar in\nthe samples from the North and South Massifs: (1)\nbrown pyroxene-lined vugs occur in rocks from both\nareas, although they are much better developed in the\nNorth Massif samples; (2) rare blue-gray breccias with\nvesicles were returned from stations 2 and 6; and (3)\nrare breccias with abundant honey-brown mineral and\ndistinctive dark-gray mineral clasts were found at\nstations 3 and 7.\nSignificant differences include the virtual lack of\nlarge light-colored clasts and prominent vesicles from\nthe boulders studied at the South Massif. Both these\nfeatures are found in the North Massif boulder\nsamples; in addition, the station 7 boulder has dikes\nof blue-gray material injecting a large clast.

Fluted surface is glass coated and glass veined (AS1 7-146-22370) (inset\nphotographs, S-73-17817, 17962, and 17814, respectively).\n\nbreccias include: (1) vuggy metaclastic clasts occur\nonly in station 2 breccias; (2) light-gray breccia at\nstation 2 occurs as a large boulder, whereas light-gray\nbreccias from the North Massif are known only as\nsubordinate inclusions in station 6 boulders; and (3)\nmany friable cataclasites were returned from the\nNorth Massif.\nThe similarity of the rock types between the\nNorth and South Massifs suggests that the samples\nmay represent only one stratigraphic unit. The\ngreenish-gray breccia, light-gray breccia, and blue-gray\nbreccia, seen as discrete boulders at station 2, are all\n\ncomponents of the same boulder at station 6. This\nevidence indicates that they may come from a single\nunit in the South Massif. There apparently is an\nunsampled type of dark rock that occurs high on the\nNorth Massif. It may represent a layer or lenses in the\nupper part of the massif. The foliated and layered\nbreccia (station 2, boulder 1) is different and probably represents the capping blue-gray unit of the\nSouth Massif that was recognized in the field by the\ncrew. Boulder 2 at station 2 appeared to the crew to\nresemble the tan-gray unit that underlies the bluegray unit of the South Massif.\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATION OF THE LANDING SITE\n\nSubfloor Basalts\nField Occurrence\n\nI\n\nSubfloor basalts occur in the dark portions of the\nvalley floor both as scattered blocks and fragments\nand as concentrations of blocks on the walls and rims\nof the larger craters. The areas in which the basalts\nwere most thoroughly sampled were on the rims of\nShorty and Camelot Craters, in the LM/ALSEP/SEP\narea, and at station 1.\nSeveral varieties of basalt were described on the\nlunar surface. The predominant types were coarsegrained, vesicular, relatively light-colored basalts composed of clinopyroxene, ilmenite, and 30 to 40\npercent plagioclase. Vesicles as large as x 1 cm in\ndiameter typically comprised 10 to 15 percent of\nthese rocks. In some rocks, planar partings paralleled\nbands expressed as differing concentrations of vesicles. Finer-grained and less vesicular varieties of basalt\nwere recognized locally.\nShorty Crater.-Subfloor basalts were sampled on\nthe rim crest of Shorty Crater in the vicinity of a 5-m\nboulder (fig. 641). Debris that may have been shed\nfrom the boulder lies on the nearby surface, and\nblocks are abundant on this part of the inner crater\nwall. All the rocks examined were basalts that are\n\nFIGURE 6 4 1.-Northwest-looking photograph showing intensely fractured basalt boulder on rim of Shorty Crater\nand locations of samples 74255 and 74275 (AS17-13720990).\n\n6-3 5\n\ncommonly intensely fractured; some show irregular\nknobby surfaces that resemble the surfaces of terrestrial flow breccias.\nShorty Crater is 110 m in diameter and is most\nprobably a young impact crater. Its blocky floor is\nx 10 to 15 m below the general surface level near the\ncrater, and its walls are largely composed of relatively\nfine fragmental material. The impacting projectile\nshould have encountered hard rock at a depth of no\nless than 10 to 15 m, and ejecta was therefore\nexcavated from depths no greater than ~ 2 m\n0\n(approximately one-fifth crater diameter). It is possible that basalt fragments on the crater rim may be\nejecta derived from within the upper 5 to 10 m of\nbedrock of the subfloor basalt unit at the Shorty site.\nAn alternative interpretation is that coherent bedrock\nwas not excavated by Shorty and that the basalt\nfragments on its rim are blocks ejected from preShorty regolith.\nCamelot Crater.-Subfloor basalts were collected\nfrom the rim of the large (650 m) crater Camelot.\nThe blocks, which are partly buried by soil, are\nexposed near and along the low, rounded rim crest of\nthe crater and extend downward into the crater walls\n(fig. 6-42) where, as in other craters, blocks are\nabundant. Outward from the rim crest, the block\npopulation decreases rapidly within a few meters.\nWithin the block field, individual rocks, varying\nfrom cobble to boulder size, are subrounded to\n\nFIGURE 642.-North-looking photograph of part of station\n5 area showing tabular basalt boulders on southwest rim\nand inner wall of Camelot Crater.

The rocks tend to\nbe tabular in shape (fig. 642) and no doubt preferentially broke along the well-developed set of partings\n(fig. 643). The partings parallel bands formed by\nvariations in vesicle concentration. Descriptions by\nthe crew indicated that the rocks were predominantly\ncoarse-grained, subophitic, pyroxene-bearing basalts\nwith shiny ilmenite platelets in the vugs and vesicles.\nThe rocks appear to be notably uniform except for\ngray zones that may represent finer-grained or nonvesicular areas.\nThe large basalt blocks on the Camelot rim\nundoubtedly represent ejecta from the crater. Impact\ntheory suggests that the stratigraphically lowest target\nmaterials will most probably be located in the ejecta\nnearest the crater rim and that the maximum depth\nfrom which material is likely to be excavated is\napproximately one-fifth crater diameter-130 m deep\nin the case of Camelot. However, the crater is old,\nand the rim has been eroded. The rocks sampled may\nnot, therefore, represent the uppermost part of the\noriginal ejecta, and 130 m should be regarded as the\nmaximum possible depth of their origin.\nLMIALSEPISEP area.-Large boulders of subfloor\nbasalt were observed and sampled in the LM/ALSEP/\n\nFIGURE 643.-Northwest-looking photograph of vesicles\nand prominent parallel partings in basalt boulder on\nsouthwest rim o f Camelot Crater.

The crew described the rocks as uniform,\ncoarse, vesicular, porphyritic, clinopyroxene-bearing\nbasalts with r~ 30 to 40 percent plagioclase and with\nilmenite platelets in the vugs and vesicles. Vesicles\ncommonly make up 10 to 15 percent of rock\nsurfaces. A foliated effect is created by partings that\nparallel bands of differing vesicle concentration. The\nrocks are commonly fractured. A single set of parallel\nfractures is visible in one boulder (fig. 6-44), whereas\nso-called \xe2\x80\x9cGeophone Rock\xe2\x80\x9d is intricately fractured\n(fig. 6-45).\nBlocks in the LM/ALSEP/SEP area belong to a\npopulation of boulders that project through the dark\nfloor material throughout the area east of Camelot\nCrater. Scarcity of such boulders west of Camelot\nsuggests that the boulders near the LM are probably\nnot Camelot ejecta but rather ejecta from the craters\neast of the LM in the central cluster.\nStation ].-Station 1 is located on the northwestern flank of Steno Crater = 150 m from the\nSteno rim crest. Subfloor basalt was collected as small\nfragments from the soil and as chips from two\nvesicular 0.5-m boulders on the rim of a 10-m crater\n(fig. 646). As at Camelot Crater, the large boulders\nare bounded in part by tabular faces and contain\nparallel parting planes. A distinct planar boundary\nbetween coarsely vesicular basalt and finely vesicular\nbasalt is oblique to a set of parallel fractures in one of\nthe boulders.\n\nFIGURE 644.-South-looking photograph showing parallel\nfractures in 0.5-m-high boulder south of deep drill site.\nGeophone Rock is at upper left (AS17-134-20505).\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATION OF THE LANDING SITE\n\n6-3 7\n\nFIGURE 645.-Southwest-lookng photograph of Geophone Rock, an intricately-fractured, vesicular, 3-m-high basalt boulder (AS17-147-22535).\n\nThe 1O-m crater presumably reexcavated basalt\nblocks from within the upper 2 m of the ejecta\nblanket of Steno Crater.

Olivine is present in trace amounts in\nsome of these rocks; where present, it commonly\noccurs as partially reacted cores in the pyroxene\nphenocrysts. The ilmenite content, while high for\nmare basalts as a whole, is relatively low compared to\nother Apollo 17 basalts and averages between 15 and\n20 percent. The plagioclase content averages 25 to 35\npercent. Some layering occurs in larger hand samples:\nin one case, grain-size variations are noted; in others,\nfeldspar and ilmenite laths are alternately foliated and\nrandomly oriented. Vugs are more conimon than\nvesicles, although both may be present in the same\nrock. Cavity content is variable but averages 10 to 15\npercent; vugs are alined in planes, are clearly elongate,\nand are layered by abundance. Sample 70035 is a\ntypical example of this class of basalts.\nVesicular coarse-grained basalts are very similar to\nthose of the above class except that they lack the\npyroxene-ilmenite phenocrysts, and their average\ngrain size tends to be somewhat finer (x 1.0 mm).\nThis class of basalts is typified by sample 75055.\n\nVesicular fine-grained basalts are characterized by\na high proportion of vugs and vesicles with ilmeniterich linings and by a groundmass grain size ranging\nfrom 0.3 to 0.6 mm. Olivine is commonly present in\nrocks of this class as microphenocrysts in amounts of\n1 to 2 percent. These rocks are characterized by vug\nand vesicle abundances of more than 30 percent;\nsome are frothy. Sample 71055 is a typical example\nof this class of basalts.\nDense aphanitic basalts are characterized by their\nvery low abundance of cavities and their extremely\nfine grain size. Olivine microphenocrysts are widely\nrepresented but not abundant. The average grain size\nof these rocks is = 0.1 to 0.2 mm. Sample 70215 is\ntypical of this class of basalts.\nVesicular aphanitic basalts are characterized by\nabundant and exceptionally large cavities and very\nfine grain size. Small amounts of olivine are present in\nsome samples. Vugs are commonly as large as a\ncentimeter and reach 3 to 4 cm. Sample 74235\ntypifies this group.\nIt is possible that the two coarse-grained basalt\ntypes are gradationally related by decrease of porphyritic pyroxene-ilmenite aggregates, but our best judgment at present is that they represent separate flow\nunits. It seems more likely that the vesicular finegrained basalts are gradationally related to the vesicular aphanitic basalts through decrease in grain size and\nincrease in vesicle size. The dense aphanitic basalts\nseem clearly to be fragments of a separate flow unit.\nA few samples cannot at present be fitted into\nthese five categories. Samples 71549, 71557, and\n71568 are coarse-grained basalts, but we cannot at\npresent say whether or not they are porphyritic.\nSample 71597 contains 20 to 25 percent olivinemore than any other basalt in the Apollo 17\ncollection.\n\nStratigraphy\nA classification of basalts by type and Lunar\nReceiving Laboratory (LRL) number is summarized\nin table 6-IV. Station numbers are implicit in LRL\nnumbers. (LRV samples are given the station number\nto which the LRV was proceeding when the sample\nwas taken.) As evidenced by table 64V, the five\nbasalt types have a fairly wide distribution over the\ntraverse area. It is also apparent that the distribution\nis asymmetric in detail: for example, only one\ncoarse-grained basalt was collected at station 4 , and\nno fine-grained types were collected at station 5.\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nGEOLOGIC\n\nTABLE\nVesicular_\nporphyritic,\ncoarse-grained\nbasalts\n\nSpecimen\n\nVesicular\ncoarse-grained\nbasalts\nb70185\nd71049\nd71067\nd71086\nd71503\n\nb70017\nc70035\nc70135 to 70139\nc70145 to 70149\nc70155 to 70157\nd70165(?)\nb70275\nb70315\nd71045to\nd71069\nd71085\nd71088\nd71095\nd71509\nd,e71536\nd,e71559\n\n6-IV.-Hand\n\nINVESTIGATION\n\nClassification\n\nc71035\nc71055\nd71087\n\nand 71068\n\nVesicular\naphanitic\nbasalts\nd71075\nd,e71525\n\nb70215\nb70255\nd71048\nd71065 and 71066\nd71089\nd71096 and 71097\nd71505 and 71506\nd,e71529\n\n71.557, 71568, and 71597 not classified at this time.

The maximum depth from\nwhich the basalt boulders on its rim were excavated is\n= 130 m. Vesicular coarse-grained basalt, represented\nby Camelot rim ejecta, may be the deepest subfloor\nmaterial sampled on the mission, and the contact\nbetween vesicular coarse-grained material and the\n\nnext shallower unit may be at some depth < 130 m.\nAt station 1, which lies approximately one-fourth\ncrater diameter out on the flank of Steno Crater, the\nlarger blocks and most of the loose rocks larger than\n5 cm in diameter are of vesicular fine-grained basalt.\nThe station is within the mappable continuous ejecta\n\nPRELIMINARY\nof Steno. If these\nfrom intermediate\n\nGEOLOGIC\n\nINVESTIGATION\n\nare original Steno ejecta, material\ndepths (< 120 m) could be ex-\n\npected in that part of the ejecta blanket.\nIn the LM/ALSEP/SEP\narea, the large blocks\n\nare\n\nvesicular,\nporphyritic,\ncoarse-grained\nbasalts. They\nbelong to the population\nof large blocks that characterized the central cluster ejecta (see section entitled\n"Regolith\nand Mantle Units of the Valley Floor").\nThose in the LM area are difficult to relate to the\ncontinuous\nejecta of any single crater and may, in\nfact, represent\nrays or ballistic ejecta from one or\nmore central cluster craters. If so, they could have\nbeen derived from any depth within the sequence\npenetrated\nby the central cluster craters. The largest\ncraters are _ 600 m in diameter; hence, maximum\nsampling depth is _ 120 m (one-fifth\ncrater diameter). If this rock type intergrades\nwith the vesicular\ncoarse-grained\nbasalt sampled at Camelot, it probably\ncomes from a slightly higher stratigraphic\nlevel.\nExcept for the intensely fractured\n5-m boulder at\nShorty, which is vesicular, porphyritic,\ncoarse-grained\nbasalt, all fragments\ncollected\nthere are of dense\naphanitic\nor vesicular aphanitic basalt. If the interpretation\nthat the coarse basalts are related is correct,\nthe large 5-m boulder may have been reexcavated by\nShorty Crater from the ejecta of some older large\ncrater. The absence of this basalt among the other\nfragments that were collected at Shorty also suggests\nthat it does not represent the upper part of the local\nbedrock,\nwhereas\nthe exclusive\nconcentration\nof\naphanitic basalt fragments\nsuggests that these may indeed represent shallow bedrock.\nSampled\nsubfloor\nbasalts\nwere most probably\nderived from depths between _ 20 and 130 m. The\nstratigraphically\nlowest basalt unit is interpreted\nto be\nthe vesicular coarse-grained\nbasalt sampled\nat the\nCamelot rim. This unit may grade upward into the\ncoarse-grained\nporphyritic\ntype sampled in the LM/\nALSEP/SEP\narea. The next stratigraphic\nunit, proceeding upward,\nis the vesicular fine-grained basalt\nrepresented\nin the Steno ejecta, and the aphanitic\nbasalts of the Shorty ejecta may be the shallowest\nrecognizable\nstratigraphic\n\ntypes. It should be stressed\nsuccession is speculative.\n\nthat\n\nthis\n\nOrigin\nThe landing site valley is interpreted\nto be a deep\ngraben formed at the time of the Serenitatis impact\nevent. Geophysical\ndata collected during the mission\n\nOF THE LANDING\n\nSITE\n\n6-41\n\nsuggest that the graben floor is overlain by 1 km or\nmore of high-density\nmaterial (secs. 10 and 13). The\nsampled part of the subfloor basalt is interpreted\nto\nrepresent the upper part of the high-density\ngrabenf\'tlling material, which may consist entirely of basalt.\nRadiometric age determinations\n(ref. 6-6) suggest that\nfilling of the valley by lava flows may have been\ncompleted\nby approximately\n3.8 billion years ago.\nBefore the final accumulation\nof the Serenitatis mare\nfill, broad arching east of the Serenitatis basin tilted\nthe sub floor lavas to the east as shown in the present\n1 \xc2\xb0 eastward tilt of the valley floor.\n\nHighlands\n\nRegolith\n\nand Surficial\n\nDeposits\n\nThe formation\nof a regolith of impact-generated\ndebris has been a continuous process in the highlands\nof the Taurus-Littrow\narea as elsewhere on the Moon.\nThe amount\nof regolith formed on any surface is\nporportional\nto the length of time that the surface\nhas been exposed\nto bombardment\nby impacting\nbodies, whereas the thickness of regolith now present\nis also a function\nof the rate of removal of the\nloosened debris. Theoretically,\ndebris on flat surfaces because\n\nthere is no net loss of\nthe debris ejected from\n\na point of impact is balanced by the influx of debris\nfrom nearby and distant impacts. On slopes, there is a\nnet loss of regolith as impacts at lower levels\nthrow balancing\namounts\nof debris to the\nlevels. Such a net loss of debris, sufficient to\nbedrock, occurs at the lip of Rima Hadley, the\n\nfail to\nhigher\nexpose\nApollo\n\n15 landing site (ref. 6-7).\nThe rolling tops of the massifs and the Sculptured\nHills are considered\nvery old surfaces with thick\naccumulations\nof regolith.\nOn the generally\nflat\nsurface above the Sculptured\nHills, in particular, very\nthick regolith is implied by the close spacing of the\nmany large craters. The regolith there is probably\nseveral tens of meters thick.\nThe upper slopes of the massifs are nearly free of\nregolith as shown by exposures\nof bouldery\nzones\nthat may represent near-surface bedrock. Such zones\noccur on the upper one-third of the South Massif,\nhigh on the East Massif, and on the upper two-thirds\nof the North Massif. These zones seem to have been\nthe sources of most of the large boulders now resting\nlower on the slopes as indicated\nby boulder tracks.\nThe slope of the Sculptured\nHills just above station 8\nis either mostly\ncovered with thick regolith or is\n\n6-42\ncomposed\n\nAPOLLO\n17\nof material\n\nso friable\n\nthat\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nboulders\n\nor\n\nbedrock ledges are rapidly disintegrated\nby impact.\nIn addition to the net downslope\nmovement\nof\nejecta, loose material tends to roll, slide, or bounce\ndown\nsteep slopes in response\nto gravity.\nSuch\nmovements may be initiated by jarring due to impacts\nor seismic events or by oversteepening\nof slopes by\ncratering\nor faulting.\nDeposits\nformed\nby these\nprocesses are distinguished herein as surficial deposits.\nVolumetrically,\nthe most important\nsurficial deposit is talus, a poorly sorted deposit composed\nof\ndebris that has arrived essentially piece by piece at its\nplace of deposition\non tile lower slopes. The boulders\nresting near the bases of slopes and at the ends of\ntrails leading down the slopes are clearly visible parts\nof the talus. Impact fragments thrown onto the lower\nslopes also comprise part of the talus. At the bases of\nlarge slopes, the talus forms a continuous\napron.\nSeparate talus streaks rather than aprons are clearly\nvisible on the inner slopes of some of the large fresh\ncraters in the region.\nOther surficial deposits,\ndenoted herein as mass\nmovement deposits, occur as masses of debris that lie\nbeyond the bases of the slopes. These deposits result\nwhen masses of loose debris, mostly regolith, move\ndownslope\nas tumbling\nor sliding units driven by\ngravity and gather sufficient\nmomentum\nto move\nbeyond the steep slopes. These materials\nare commonly set in motion by some jarring event or when\nthey become unstable on oversteepened\nslopes.\nSurficial deposits are undoubtedly\npresent on the\nlower parts and at the bases of all the large steep\nslopes of the highlands. Gentle intermediate\nslopes\nnear the base may reflect\nthe occurrence\nof a\nhigh-lava mark of subfloor basalt. The slopes are more\nprobably\ntalus deposits that may have been partly\nredistributed\nvalleyward by impacts. At stations 2, 6,\nand LRV-10, located on the gentle slopes immediately above the valley floor, fillets occur preferentially on the upslope\nsides of boulders,\nwhich\nindicates\nAlong\n\nthat debris is currently moving downstope.\nmuch of the base of the South Massif, the\n\ntalus intersects the valley floor at a sharp angle, which\nsuggests that downslope\nmovements\nhave been renewed\nso recently,\nperhaps as a consequence\nof\nrecent massif uplift, that impact processes have not\nhad time to round the knickpoint.\nPart of this talus\ndeposit\nhas filled approximately\nthree-fourths\nof\nNansen\nCrater.\nThe Nansen\nimpact\nundoubtedly\ncaused oversteepening\nat the base of the talus slope.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nProbably the oversteepened,\nalready fragmented rock\ndebris started moving immediately\nto fill enough of\nthe crater to reestablish equilibrium\nat the angle of\nrepose.\nExcept for a few boulders with enough energy to\nclimb slightly up the opposing slope of the north wall\nof Nansen, the debris merely slid into the crater but\ndid not cross it. The present appearance of the massif\nslope into Nansen is that of an active talus apron that\nis slowly continuing to fill the crater.\nThe best documented\nmass movement\ndeposit is\nthe light mantle at the base of the South Massif,\nwhich is presumed\nto be a mass of debris that\nobtained\nenough kinetic energy to spread out across\nthe valley floor for a distance of _ 6 km. In several\nplaces, there is evidence for mass movement deposits\nolder than the talus aprons. Subdued lobes extend\nfrom the highland slopes onto the valley floor along\nthe base of tile North Massif and along the base of the\nSouth Massif between Nansen Crater and Bear Mountain. It is possible that some of these lobes are mass\nmovement deposits overlying the subfloor basalt.\nMass movements\nand formation\nof talus deposits\nshould date back to the earliest uplift of the massifs.\nIf the bounding faults were, as we suppose, steeper\nthan the angle of repose for loose fragments,\nthere\nmust have been a large transfer of material down the\nnewly formed slopes until the angle of repose was\nreached.\nThus, mass movement\ndeposits and thick\ntalus aprons buried by subfloor basalt are inferred to\noverlie the still older rocks that formed the initial\nfloor and walls of the Taurus-Littrow\n\nRegolith\n\nand Mantle\n\nUnits\n\nvalley.\n\nof the Valley\n\nFloor\n\nThe subfloor\nbasalt is overlain\nby fragmental\ndebris that is as much as 15 m thick where it is cut by\nShorty and Van Serg Craters.

In addition, major crater\nejecta blankets around the central crater cluster and\nShorty and Van Serg Craters are mapped and described as separate portions of the surficial debris\nlayer. Inferred stratigraphic relationships among these\nunits are shown in figure 6 4 8 .\n\nPetrography of Regolith Breccias\nA total of 14 samples of breccia (70018, 70019,\n70175, 71515, 72135, 79035,791 15,79135,79175,\n79195, 79225, 79226, 79227, and 79228) was\ncollected from the valley floor at stations 1, 9,\nLMIALSEPISEP, and LRV-1. Most of the samples are\nprobably soil breccias ejected from the older regolith.\nSome, however, such as 70019, are soil breccias\nformed by impacts in the younger regolith. These\nbreccias are all dark to very dark gray, are friable to\nmoderately coherent with numerous penetrative fractures, and typically have low clast populations.\nSamples 791 15 and 79135 are layered, with\nalternating layers on the order of several centimeters\nthick that are distinguished by differing clast abundances. Similar layering is also visible in lunar surface\nphotographs of breccia boulders at Van Serg Crater\n(fig. 6-49). Surfaces of penetrative fractures are\ncommonly weakly slickensided, as was typical of\nregolith breccias returned from earlier Apollo missions. Slickensides are especially well developed in\nsample 79 135. Clasts larger than 1 mm make up from\n1 to = 15 percent of the breccias; most clasts are\nsmaller than 1 cm, although the crew reported clasts\nas large as 0.5 m in breccias of this type at Van Serg\n\n6-43\n\nCrater. Samples 70019 and 79175 are breccias composed of friable dark clods loosely cemented by dark\nglass; these also closely resemble rocks returned by\nearlier Apollo missions.\nRegolith breccias were also found at two areas\nmarginal to the valley floor. Five small breccia\nfragments (78508 and 78515 to 78518) were found\nin a soil sample from station 8. Samples taken from\nSWP Crater (e.g., 78120), did not survive in pieces\nlarger than 1 cm but appear to be similar to the other\nregolith breccias.\n\nOlder Regolith\nThe ejecta of the 90-m-diameter Van Serg Crater\nincludes a large proportion of soft, dark, matrix-rich\nbreccias (figs. 6-49 and 6-50) the petrography of\nwhich is described in the preceding section. On the\ncrater rim, the breccias contain scattered light-gray\nlithic clasts that are as large as ~2 cm in diameter.\nLight clasts as large as 0.5 m in diameter were seen in\nthe dark-matrix fragment-rich breccia on the crater\nfloor.\nThe Van Serg breccias can be interpreted as\nregolith materials indurated by the impact that\nformed Van Serg Crater. So far as we know, subfloor\nbasalt was not excavated by the impact, although\ntraverse gravity data (sec. 13) imply its presence in\nthe subsurface.

The\ndeepest part, represented by the Van Serg rim and\nfloor rocks, is presumed older than the central cluster\nejecta and hence represents older regolith material.\n\nCentral Cluster Ejecta\nThe regolith is subdivided locally by recognizing as\nunique a portion that is considered to be the complex\nejecta blanket of a cluster of large craters that lie\nmostly to the south and east of the LM (fig. 6-51).\nThis unit, distinguished by an abundance of blocks\nvisible at the surface, is termed the central cluster\nejecta. Younger deposits are apparently too thin to\nbury the blocks in the unit, and the unit is too young\nfor the blocks to have been reduced much in size by\nlater impacts. The general distribution of blocks\nconsidered as central cluster ejecta is shown in figure\n6-51. It is assumed that beyond a crater diameter\nfrom the nearest crater of the cluster, the fine-grained\nejecta will be present in significant amounts only\ndiscontinuously. The unit probably does not extend\nas far as the LRV station at Tortilla Flat but may\ncoat station 5.\nThe shape of the central cluster ejecta unit must\n\nbe that of a very complex lens as it is composed of\nthe ejecta, rim, and continuous blanket deposits of\neach of the craters within the cluster. At station 1, a\n2-m-deep crater does not appear to have penetrated\nthe total thickness of the unit, which is expectable\nbecause station 1 is only approximately one-fourth\ncrater diameter out from the rim of Steno, a member\nof the cluster. At the deep core site, = 40 m north of\nthe ALSEP central station, the central cluster ejecta is\nassumed to be thin because the site is more than a\ncrater diameter away from any large member of the\ncluster. The deep core probably penetrated the entire\nunit; the change of soil appearance, seen in corestem\njoints, at a depth of = 1 m probably indicates the\nbase of the central cluster ejecta.\nAll blocks from the central cluster ejecta that were\nsampled are considered to be subfloor basalts. Smaller\nsampled fragments are more difficult to relate to a\nsource, but the preponderance of surface rock fragments from the LM/ALSEP/SEP and station 1 sites\nmust have come from the subfloor basalt either\ndirectly or after reexcavation. Soil samples in the area\nmust be considered as originating from the overlying\nyounger regolith unit. The ejecta of the central\ncluster unit is inferred from crater depths and\nestimated regolith thickness t o contain roughly three\ntimes as much subfloor basalt as older regolith. The\nolder regolith contains a large percentage of fine\nbasalt fragments, so the expected amount of basalt in\nthe central cluster ejecta, or later reexcavated deposits, is at least 80 percent. A net effect of the\ncentral cluster ejecta was to create an immature\nregolith surface layer overlying what must have been,\nin general, a very mature regolith. The immaturity is\nmost easily seen in the common occurrence of blocks\nand rock fragments. It is also reflected in the\nlithologic composition by the high percentage of\nfragments newly derived from the subfloor basalt and\na little admixture of exotic components such as ejecta\nfrom impacts in the highlands.\nSamples collected from the central cluster ejecta,\neither directly from boulders protruding through the\nyounger regolith or from reexcavated parts of the\nunit adjacent to some recent crater, would be\nexpected to consist mostly of subfloor basalts that\noriginally came from the uppermost 120 m of that\nunit.\n\nYounger Regolith\nPremission mapping of the Taurus-Littrow valley\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATION OF THE LANDING SITE\n\n6-45\n\nFIGURE 6-51 .-Map showing the craters of the central cluster, related boulders, and the outline of the\ncentral cluster ejecta.\n\nshowed the valley floor to be covered with a dark\nmantle unit considered younger than the subfloor\nbasalts and older than the light mantle. With the\nrecognition of the central cluster ejecta unit, the\ndefinition of the dark mantle must be modified. The\nsurface layer of material that overlies the central\ncluster ejecta where it is present is herein considered\nas a unit, composed of both regolith and whatever\ndark mantle may be present, and is termed the\nyounger regolith. The surface of this unit was\ntraversed, so all shallow soil samples should be part of\nit. The light mantle is considered as a local unit that is\nequivalent to some central part of the younger\nregolith. Regolith younger than the central cluster\nejecta is certainly present at the landing site, but a\n\nunique component that can be called dark mantle has\nnot been identified. The reasons for having postulated\na dark mantle unit during premission mapping remain\nvalid and will be briefly stated. The findings of the\nApollo 17 crew will then be summarized.\nAn area of very low albedo is present along the\nsoutheastern edge of the Serenitatis basin as shown\non full-Moon photographs (fig. 6-52). The boundaries\nof this area have been mapped somewhat differently\nby various mappers and the interpretations of the\nvery low albedo have differed, but the presence of an\nanomalous area has been recognized by previous\nworkers (refs. 6-1 and 6-2 and part B of sec. 29).\nPhotographs taken during the Apollo 15 mission\nindicated that dark areas existed along the edge of\n\n6-46\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n;-Littrow\n\nalley\n\ntle\n\ni\nF:IGURE 6-52.-Earth-hased telescopic view of southeastern part ot\' Mare Serenitatis showing light\ncentral mare, dark annular ring, and dark mantle (US.Navy photograph 5819).\n\nMare Serenitatis, in tlie valleys to the southeast, and\nas spots and discontinuous coatings in the highlands.\nThis distribution scemed t o require an interpretation\nof a thin mantling unit that conformed to underlying\ntopography. Several experiments seemed to confirm\nthe presence of a dark mantle unit, especially the\nspectral results that indicated a compositional difference from other mare volcanic types (ref. 6-8).\nBecause it is widespread, the dark mantle was\n\ninterpreted as most likely to be a volcanic pyroclastic\ndeposit with many source vents located both in the\nhighlands and in the valleys. The thickness was\nconsidered to range from as much as 20 m to as little\nas a few centimeters within the traverse area planned\nfor tlie Apollo 17 crew. The reasons for the existence\nof a dark mantling unit are discusscd in detail in part\nB of section 29.\nThe photographs taken from orbit during tlie\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nGEOLOGIC\n\nINVESTIGATION\n\nOF THE LANDING\n\nSITE\n\n6-47\n\nApollo\n17 mission\npermit\na reevaluation\nof the\nvery-low-albedo\narea seen on the full-Moon photographs.\nThe low Sun angles of the Apollo\n17\nphotographs\npermit\nindividual\nmare units to be\nseparated.\nA comparison\nof the Apollo 17 photographs with the full-Moon photograph\nshows that, in\nthe Mons Argaeus area, the dark mantle edge cuts\nacross mare unit contacts and is thus independent\nof\nthe mare units. In the Mons Argaeus area, the dark\nmantle\napparently\noverlies the high-albedo,\nmain\nmare unit of Mare Serenitatis.\nAs shown in figure\n6-52, the very low albedo of the dark mantle unit\n\nthe cone considered\nas a cinder cone (ref. 6-9). On\nthe Apollo 17 photographs\ntaken at a low Sun angle,\nthe area has many sharply defined small craters, but\nlarger features are definitely more rounded in appearance than they are in adjacent\nareas. The best\nexplanation\nseems to be that the area is a unit of\n\nextends\nfrom the Mons Argaeus area eastward to\ninclude the landing site. Hills west of the landing site,\nin addition to having a very low albedo, have a more\nrounded\nand subdued\nappearance\nthan\nadjacent\nbrighter hills as though covered by a thin mantle.\nIn summary,\nthe weight of evidence favors the\nformation\nof a dark mantle\nsometime\nafter the\n\nconsidered to be evidence for dark mantle, and their\nnearness to the traverse area suggests that at least a\nfew centimeters\nof dark mantle might exist in the\ntraverse area. Such a thin unit with the degree of\ncratering seen in the smooth areas would be gardened\nby impacts to a depth greater than its thickness; that\nis, it would not exist as a pure layer but would be\n\ndeposition\nof the subfloor\nbasalt in the TaurusLittrow region. Evidence that the mantle is substantially younger than the subfloor is present in one area\nto the west of the landing site. The dark material\napparently\nhas been mixed with underlying\nmaterial\ninto a regolith unit.\nThe thickness of dark mantle that was suggested in\npremission studies ranged from several centimeters\nto\n20 m. The 20-m thickness was based on the hypothesis that Shorty Crater had ejected only dark mantle\nfrom beneath light mantle. Most of the thickness at\nShorty between\nthe light mantle and subfloor basalt\nis now considered older regolith, and no distinct dark\nmantle layer was seen. If only several centimeters\nof\ndark mantle were present, it could be mixed with the\nregolith portion of the valley fill unit. Although no\nunique dark mantle component\nhas been identified at\nthe Apollo 17 site, the evidence for such a component at the edge of Mare Serenitatis seems inescapable. The low albedo may be caused by the presence\nof many tiny opaque black spheres found in the soils\n\nmixed with underlying\n\n(sec. 7).\nNew photographs\nfrom orbit reinforce\nother evidence for the existence of a mantling component\nin\nthe Family Mountain\nregion just a few kilometers\nwest of the traverse\nroute.\nThe evidence is the\npresence\ndifferent.\ngraphs, a\nof focus\nMountain\n\nof surface\nareas that appear\ndistinctly\nOn Lunar Orbiter V and Apollo 15 phototriangular area, which appeared slightly out\nor fuzzy, had been noticed between Family\nand the South Massif.

The light\nmantle was interpreted\nfrom premission photographs\nas a probable\nlandslide\nor avalanche\nfrom the steep\nnorthern\nslope of the South Massif (refs. 6-1 and\n6-10). The samples collected at stations 2, 2A, and 3\non the light mantle are similar to those that comprise\nthe South Massif, which supports this hypothesis (sec.\n7). A cluster of apparent\nsecondary\ncraters that is\nvisible on top of the South Massif in the low-Sunangle panoramic camera photographs\nfrom Apollo 17\nmay record the impacts that initiated the avalanche.\nThirteen rock samples were collected from stations\non the light mantle. Three of these samples (73155,\n73217,\nand 73235)\nare blue-gray\nbreccias with\nlight-gray clasts and appear to be very similar to those\ncollected at station 2. Sample 73217 is unusual in\nthat it has a blue-gray portion of the breccia with a\nveneer on one edge that is composed of blue-gray and\nwhite sugary clasts in a friable light-gray matrix. The\nmain body of this rock may be a clast from light-gray\nbreccia. Two samples (73215 and 73255) are lightgray breccias composed\nof gray clasts in a light-gray\nfriable matrix and appear to be very similar to those\nsampled from boulder\n1 at station 2. Sample 73215\nhas a crude foliation resulting from alternating bands\n\n6-48\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nof gray and white material. Three samples (73216,\n73218, and 73275) are greenish-gray breccias and\nappear to be similar to those collected from boulder 2\nat station 2. Five samples collected at LRV-6 (741 15\nto 741 19) are very friable, medium light-gray regolith\nbreccias that contain a few white clasts.\nThe materials of the light mantle have an albedo of\n= 20 percent at the surface, which is slightly lower\nthan the 25 percent of the massif slopes (see section\nentitled \xe2\x80\x9cAlbedo Measurements\xe2\x80\x9d). This albedo difference is probably due to the formation of a regolith\nand consequent darkening of the surface of the light\nmantle; continued downslope movement of materials\nof the South Massif brings newly exposed materials to\nthe surface of the massif, hence the darkening process\nis not so effective on the steep slopes. At a distance,\nthe crew recognized that the bright aspect of the light\nmantle is primarily manifested by numerous small\ncraters the walls and rims of which are brighter than\nany in the dark plains. These craters probably expose\nfresh material.\nThe light mantle consists mainly of unconsolidated\nfines. Comments by the crew and photographs taken\nat stations 2A and 3 and while driving indicate that\nrocks > 25 cm across are sparse on the surface of the\nunit. Smaller rocks are fairly common but not\nabundant. A single large (3 to 4 m) boulder was\nencountered on the traverse. The scarcity of rocks\nsuggests that the avalanche mainly consisted of\nregolith from the surface of the massif and did not\ninvolve the sliding of underlying bedrock.\nThe light mantle feathers out at its margins away\nfrom the South Massif. Near the extremities of the\nmantle, Shorty Crater and a smaller nearby crater\nappear to penetrate through the slide into underlying\nvalley regolith. Craters of this size nearer the South\nMassif do not penetrate to darker underlying material.\nA greater thickness near the base of the massif is\nalso suggested by the occurrence of numerous low\nridges that become less distinct farther from the\nmassif (fig. 6-53). The ridges are dined in the\napparent direction of movement of the avalanche\naway from the massif and are spaced 25 to 100 m\napart. In some orbital photographs, lineaments appear\nto form V\xe2\x80\x99s that open away from the massif. Similar\nlineament patterns are visible in areas of similar relief\njust northwest of the light mantle. This similarity\nsuggests that the V lineaments are not necessarily\nassociated with the emplacement of the avalanche.\n\n,\n1\n2\n\n0\n\nkm\n\nFIGURE 6-5 3.-Panoramic camera photograph showing details of the light mantle and Lee-Lincoln Scarp (Apollo 17\npanoramic camera frame AS17-2309).\n\nThe lineaments may be enhanced or created by the\nlighting condition, an effect that is not fully understood (refs. 6-11 and 6-12). On the other hand, the\nlineament patterns resemble interference patterns\nseen in the lee of obstacles in a moving fluid.\nDescriptions by the crew at station 2A indicate\nthat the upper portion of the light mantle is\ncomposed of 5 to 15 cm of medium-gray material\nunderlain by light-gray material. The medium-gray\nmaterial may be regolith, darkened by the formation\nof impact glass, that has been formed from small\ncontributions of dark soil from impacts occurring on\nthe dark portions of the valley floor.\nThe trench (fig. 6-54) at station 3 was dug into the\nrim of a 10-m crater. The bottom of the trench\nexposed a marbled zone of light- and medium-gray\nmaterials. The texture of the marbled material is\nsimilar to the textures and ejecta from terrestrial\nimpacts such as Meteor Crater (fig. 6-55), and this\nmaterial may be ejecta from the 10-m crater in which\nundiluted light mantle was mixed with precrater\nregolith. Overlying the marbled material is a 3cmthick layer of light material, which may represent\nunmixed light mantle ejected from well below the\nprecrater regolith. Where the trench was dug, on the\nrim of the 10-m crater, the upper part of the\nstratigraphic sequence had probably been eroded by\nimpact of small meteorites (refs. 6-7 and 6-13).

Crater counts show that\nthe saturation crater size is 2 to 4 m. The saturation\ncrater size at Tycho is 2.8 m (ref. 6-14).\nAnother way to estimate age uses the crater\ndegradation model of Soderblom and Lebofsky (ref.\n6-13). The diameter of the largest unshadowed crater\n(Dx) on Apollo 17 panoramic camera frame 2308\n(Sun angle SA = 16.3") is 30 ? 10 m. By using this\ncalculation, the age expressed as the diameter of a\ncrater ( D L ) which would be eroded to 1" slopes was\ncalculated as 13 5 m. This age compares with that\nof Tycho Crater, where D, = < 20 m (ref. 6-13). A\nminimum age for the light mantle is the exposure age\n(20 to 30 million years) for the orange soil deposited\non the rim of Shorty Crater (ref. 6-15).\nThe light mantle is larger than most other lunar\navalanches and, unlike many, has no conspicuous\nsource ledge on the slope above. New evidence\nsuggests that the avalanche was triggered by secondary impacts from a distant crater. This evidence is\nbased on the recognition on Apollo 17 low-Sun-angle\norbital photographs of a cluster of 100-ni craters on\nthe top of the South Massif and a similar cluster on\nthe plains adjacent to the northwest side of the light\nmantle. The elongation of the cluster craters suggests\nthat they are secondaries from a distant crater to the\nsouthwest, possibly of Tycho. If impacts from the\nsame cluster of secondaries impacted the northwestern slope of the South Massif, they could have\ninitiated the avalanche. Elsewhere on the Moon are\n\n0Light-gray mantle\nFIGURE 6-56.-Interpretation of stratigraphy as seen in\ntrenches on the light mantle at stations 2A and 3.\n\nother avalanches that clearly were similarly initiated\nby the impact of crater ejecta on slopes facing away\nfrom the primary crater (ref. 6-10).\n\nShorty Crater\nShorty is a fresh 110-m crater located near the\nnorth edge of the light mantle. It resembles other\ncraters that have been interpreted as young impact\ncraters. The floor is hummocky, with a low central\nmound and with marginal hummocks that resemble\nslumps forming discontinuous benches along the\nlower parts of the crater wall. The rim is distinctly\nraised and is sharp in orbital views. The dark ejecta\nblanket is easily distinguished from the high-albedo\nsurface of the surrounding light mantle, which it\noverlies. However, the low albedo of the ejecta is\nsimilar to that of the dark younger regolith elsewhere\non the plains surface.\nSamples were collected in a low place on the rim\ncrest of Shorty Crater just south of a 5-m boulder of\nfractured basalt (fig. 6-57). Debris that may have\nbeen shed from the boulder lies on the nearby\nsurface, and blocks are abundant on this part of the\ninner crater wall. All the rocks examined are basalt.\nMost are intensely fractured and some show irregular\nknobby surfaces that resemble the surfaces of terrestrial flow breccias. Rocks r a n g from angular to\nsubrounded; some are partially buried; some are\nfilleted, including the upslope sides of a few of the\nlarger boulders on the inner crater wall.\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATION OF THE LANDING SITE\n\n..\'\n\n.\n\n6-51\n\n.\n\nFIGURE 6-57.-Northwest-looking view of southwest rim of\nShorty Crater showing sampling area and areas of orange\nsoil as indicated by dashed lines. Large sampled boulder\non rim is 5 m wide (AS17-137-21009 and 21011).\n\nThe floor material, exposed in the central mound\n(fig. 6-58), is blocky and extremely jagged. It may\ndiffer in lithology from the basalts of the rim. The\nhummocks or benches that encircle the floor as well\nas portions of the walls are also blocky. However, the\nwall, the rim, and the outer flank of Shorty Crater\nconsist largely of dark material that is much finer\ngrained than the floor. On the crater rim, fragments\nas large as = 15 cm in diameter typically cover < 3\npercent of the surface. Scattered coarser fragments,\nranging up to at least 5 m in diameter, are present.\nThe crater rim and flanks are pitted by scattered,\nsmall (to several meters) craters the rims of which\nrange from sharp to subdued. Typically, their ejecta\nare no blocker, except for clods, than the adjacent\nsurfaces.\nAlthough a volcanic origin has been considered for\nShorty Crater, no compelling data to support the\nvolcanic hypothesis have been recognized. The type\nof pure accumulation of basaltic spatter or cinders\nthat forms steep-sided terrestrial volcanic cones has\nnot been recognized; nor does the steeply raised sharp\nrim of Shorty resemble the low rounded rims of\nterrestrial maar craters. Most probably, Shorty is an\nimpact crater. Its blocky floor may represent either\nimpact-indurated soil breccia or the top of the\nsubfloor basalt, which is buried by 10 to 15 m of\npoorly consolidated regolith, including light mantle\n(fig. 6-59). The predominantly fine-grained wall, rim,\nand flank materials are probably ejecta derived largely\nfrom materials above the subfloor, and the basalt\nblocks may be ejecta derived from the subfloor.\nRegardless of its origin, the crater is clearly younger\nthan the light mantle.\n\nFIGURE 6-58.-North view across 110-m-diameter Shorty\nCrater.

If so, the orange and black glassy\nmaterials may represent clods of ejecta excavated by\nthe Shorty impact. However, the symmetrical\ncolor\nzonation of the orange soil, internal color zoning of\nat least one clod, and apparent\nparallelism\nof the\nsteep boundaries\nof the zone with both the internal\ncolor banding\nand the axis of the rim crest are\nimprobable\nfeatures for a clod of ejecta unless the\nclod has undergone\nalteration\nsubsequent\nto its\nemplacement,\na process heretofore\nunknown on the\nMoon.

Evidence for its being younger than\nShorty is equivocal.\nIts rim seems to be slightly\nsharper\nthan the rim of Shorty in orbital photographs,\nand small craters\nmay be slightly more\nabundant on the Shorty rim.\nThere is no evidence that the Van Serg impact\nexcavated subfloor basalt. The fragment-rich\nbreccias\nand dark matrix-rich\nbreccias of its floor, rim, and\nouter flank may be regolith breccias indurated in the\nVan Serg impact. If this reasoning is correct, then at\nleast 15 m of regolith is inferred\nto overlie the\nsubfloor basalt in the Van Serg area. However, these\nbreccias may be of a volcanic type not previously\nrecognized and may be associated\nwith the orange\nand black glass formations.\nNear coincidence of the albedos of the blocky Van\nSerg ejecta blanket and the nearby smooth regolith\nsurface is puzzling. Possible explanations\nare that the\nelusive dark mantle material is represented\nin the\nejected older regolith as well as at the present regolith\nsurface or that the dark surface material recognized\non the crater rim and flank has masked any distinction between the Van Serg ejecta and the nearby undisturbed regolith surface.\n\nand Sculptured\n\nHills\n\nEach massif block probably is a structural entity\nuplifted during the Serenitatis event. Rejuvenation\nof\nthese older structural\nelements may have occurred\nduring the Imbrian event as suggested by the elongation of the Taurus-Littrow\nvalley, which is radial to\nboth Imbrium and Serenitatis.\nSegmentation\nof the\nmassifs may be an inheritance\nfrom the even earlier\nTranquillitatis\nevent.\nThe massifs adjacent\nto the landing site appear\nsimilar in slope, albedo, and degree of cratering. They\ncontrast with the closely spaced domical hills of the\nSculptured\nHills, which also form fault block mountains. No unequivocal\nSculptured\nHills material has\nbeen recognized\namong\nthe samples; hence,\nthe\nreason for the differing appearances\nof the massifs\nand the Sculptured\nHills is not clearly understood.\nThe massifs may consist of distinctly different materials with more friable material\noccurring\nin the\nSculptured\nHills. For example,\nthe massifs may\nconsist largely of pre-Serenitatis\nejecta uplifted in the\nSerenitatis\nevent, whereas the Sculptured\nHills may\nconsist mainly of Serenitatis\nejecta. Alternatively,\neach might consist mainly of a different\nfacies of\nSerenitatis\nejecta, with more thorough\nrecrystallization increasing the coherence of the massif materials.\nOn the other hand, the initial materials of the two\nunits may be similar, but subsequent\ndeformational\nhistory may have caused their different aspects.

A few\nprominent smaller west-facing scarps are present, best\nseen from Lara Crater northward where the shadowed\nhighlighting is enhanced by the whiteness of the light\nmantle\n(fig. 6-53). Individual\nsegments\ndisappear\nalong strike as another picks up the displacement;\nin\nplaces, it appears\nalmost braided.\nThe trends\nof\nindividual segments of the scarp appear to alternate\nbetween north and northwest\nas if controlled\nby an\nunderlying prismatic fracture system. This same set of\ntrends is identifiable\nin segments of the scarp along\nthe western base of the North Massif. Here, however,\nthe scarp is single and always faces east-toward\nthe\nmassif-in\nthe form of a reverse or thrust fault. Forty\nkilometers to the north, the scarp passes out onto the\ndark plains surface where it cuts Rima Littrow I (fig.\n6-1).\nThe overall length, trend, asymmetry,\nand morphologic character\nof the scarp resemble that of the\nlarger wrinkle ridges of the adjacent Serenitatis\nmare\n(part A of sec. 29). This similarity suggests a common\norigin-possibly\nfolding and thrusting of a thin plate\n(d&ollement\nsheet) eastward. The relative youth of\nthis deformation\nis indicated by the transection\nof\nfresh Copernican\ncraters by wrinkle\nridges in the\nmare, by the fresh, possibly rejuvenated scarplets that\nmay be younger than the light h_antle, and by the\ngood preservation\nof the scarp in the unconsolidated\nmaterials\nof the North Massif face. An alternative\npossibility is that the Lee-Lincoln Scarp is the surface\ntrace of a complex high-angle fault that changes strike\nwhere it follows the old North Massif boundary fault\nimmediately north of the valley.\n\n6-56\n\nAPOLLO\n17PRELIMINARY\nSCIENCE\nREPORT\nALBEDO\n\nMEASUREMENTS\n\nLunar surface and orbital photographs\nwere used\nto map albedo in the Taurus-Littrow\narea. Down-Sun\n60-mm photographs\nat each traverse station in combination with high-resolution\n500-mm photographs\nof\nthe mountain slopes provided the control for photometric measurements\nmade from orbital photographs.\nRelative film densities\nof Apollo 15 panoramic\ncamera frames 9557 and 9559 were measured\non a\nJoyce-Loebl\nmicrodensitometer.\nThe scanning aperture was 50/2m square, equivalent to an integrated 9\nm 2 of lunar surface. Film densities, after calibration\nto normal albedo as determined\nin down-Sun\nlunar\nsurface photographs\nin areas of fine-grained regolith\nand after adjustment\nto remove\nthe effects\nof\ntopographic\nslopes, are proportional\nto albedos of\nlunar surface materials. Topographic\ncorrections were\nderived from the NASA preliminary topographic map\nof part of the Littrow region of the Moon.\nThe resulting map (fig. 6-63) was smoothed\nto\nremove\nscanning noise and high-frequency\nalbedo\nvariations. Important\nqualifications\nare that the usual\nlunar photometric\nfunction\nwas applied\nfor the\nApollo 17 areas and that the albedo adjustments\nfor\ntopography\nare approximate\nbecause of inaccuracies\nof slope orientations.\nComparisons\nof albedo values\nare most reliable between\nareas with similarly oriented slopes.\nThe albedo map (fig. 6-63) can be compared with\nan orbital photograph\nof the area at a similar scale\n(fig. 6-64). The east-west trending valley floor is the\nmost continuous physiographic\nunit. Except for the\nlight mantle, in which albedo ranges from 14 to 23\npercent,\nthe albedo of the valley floor is low. It\nranges from 14 percent\npercent over the eastern\n\nin the\nportion.\n\nwestern part to 9\nThe albedo of the\n\nfloor generally increases gradually\nalong a 300- to 600-m-wide\nouter\ndepicted\nby unit 6) adjacent\nto\nsurrounding\nmountains.\nThis zone\nrepresent mixing of lighter highlands\nmuch darker floor regolith and is\nrower than the I- to 2-km width of\n\n(3 to 4 percent)\nzone (generally\nthe base of the\nis considered\nto\nregolith with the\nremarkably\nnara similar zone at\n\nthe Apollo 15 site (ref. 6-16). The lighter valley floor\narea between the South Massif and Family Mountain\nmay represent a more extensive mixing zone, perhaps\nrelated to the proximity\nof uplands material at the\nsurface or to its presence at very shallow depths in\nthe subsurface. Even so, the mixing zone at the foot\n\nof the South Massif (depicted by unit 5) seems to be\nas narrow as along the northern\nside of the valley\nfloor.\nThe massifs and hills surrounding\nthe valley\ngenerally have albedos ranging from 15 to 34 percent,\nas is normal for lunar highlands. However, local small\ndepressions contain dark material with albedo as low\nas 10 percent. The iightest regolith material occurs on\nthe steepest\nslopes and on top of some rounded\ndomes. The slopes of the South Massif are lightest\nfrom one-fourth\nto three-fourths\nof the way down\nthe slope front and darker near the top and bottom\nof the slopes. The small undulating plains area on top\nof the South Massif (unit 5) is as dark as the valley\nfloor between the massif and Family Mountain (14\npercent)\nwith tongues\nof the material draping over\nthe edge of the upper massif slopes and extending\ndown the steeper slopes. The North Massif has lighter\nregolith on the tops of rounded domes and down the\nupper two-thirds\nof the slopes. Small closed depressions on top of the massif that are too small to be\nshown in figure 6-63 show slight darkening\nin the\nwestern part and increasing\ndarkening\ntoward the\neastern part. The Sculptured\nHills show a general\ndarkening toward the east with the regolith in similar\nsmall depressions\nranging in albedo from 17 to 14\npercent. The large upland basin to the northeast has\nextensive regolith with 12-percent\nalbedo.

The absence of any apparent\nballistic shadowing by the mountains\nindicates that\nthe material was transported\nalong high-angle trajectories. The only lunar material known to have such\nlow albedo is dark to black glass or glassy material. A\npyroclastic-like\nmantle of dark glassy material fits the\nobserved geological relationships\nand albedo data.\n\nof 0.66, which is average\nIn the vicinity of MOCR\nthe valley, albedos of the\ncrater wall are 9 and 18\n\npercent, respectively, giving a ratio of 0.50, which is\nthe greatest degree of mare regolith darkening\never\nmeasured\non the Moon. It is probable\nthat some\ndarker material (black glass?) has been deposited over\nand mixed with an original bedrock-derived\nregolith.\nThe surface in this area, which coincides with the\ndarkest albedo unit (fig. 6-63, unit 8), also appears\nsomewhat smooth and subdued,\nin contrast to the\nlanding area.\nThe North and South Massifs show average albedos\nof _ 26 percent\nfor fine-grained\nregolith\nand 34\npercent\nfor rocks, producing\na ratio of 0.76 for\nregolith darkening,\nslightly less darkening\nthan at\nHadley Delta (Apollo 15 site). The Sculptured\nHills\nand the East Massif show local maximum albedos that\nare similar to the maximums for the North and South\nMassifs. This similarity suggests that bedrock\nwith\nsimilar albedo occurs in all four mountain\nmasses.\nThe average albedo of the Sculptured\nHills and the\nEast Massif is _ 18 percent, which gives an average\nregolith darkening ratio of 0.53. This is considerably\ndarker than the 0.74 on Hadley Delta and the 0.76 on\nthe North and South Massifs.\nCareful study of the Sculptured\nHills and the East\nMassif revealed 11 small closed depressions with areas\nof smooth floors. The normal albedo of the regolith\non the depression floors should show the maximum\ndarkening effects because mass-wasting processes tend\nto expose fresher brighter material on slopes. The\nalbedos of the depression floors decrease eastward in\nthe northern\npart of the Sculptured\nHills, ranging\nfrom 17 to 12 percent.\nThe albedos of depression\nfloors in the East Massif decrease southward beyond\nthe mapped area from 14 to 10 percent. The regolith\ndarkening ratio decreases from 0.50 to 0.29, which is\nmuch lower than any other measured\narea on the\nMoon.\n\nA darkening\n\nratio\n\nof 0.50\n\nor less strongly\n\naddition\n\nof material\n\ndarker\n\nthan\n\nlocal rego-\n\nlith, but a ratio of 0.29 is strong evidence for the\naddition of dark material from another source.\nThe increased darkening, to the south and east, of\nregolith\ndeveloped\non different\ngeologic materials\n(i.e., the eastern valley floor, the Sculptured\nHills,\nand the East Massif) is best interpreted\nas the effect\nof addition of material darker than 9-percent normal\nalbedo from sources to the east or southeast\nof the\n\nGEOLOGIC\nBefore\n\nthe\n\nSerenitatis\n\nHISTORY\nbasin\n\nwas\n\nformed,\n\nolder\n\nmajor basin impacts should have covered the TaurusLittrow area with sheets of ejecta derived from still\nolder ejecta deposits\nand ultimately\nfrom igneous\nlunar crustal material.\nBecause of their proximity,\nTranquillitatis\nand Fecunditatis\nshould have contributed large amounts of ejecta that may be exposed in\nthe massifs. The older major basin impacts should\nalso have developed\nradial and concentric\nfracture\nzones comparable\nto those around\nthe younger,\nbetter preserved basins. Some of these fractures were\npresumably reactivated in the Serenitatis event.\nThe major physiographic\nunits (e.g., the Massifs,\nthe Sculptured\nHills, and the Taurus-Littrow\nvalley)\nof this region were produced\nby the impact that\nformed\nthe Serenitatis\nbasin. Major radial faults\nbound the Taurus-Littrow\nvalley and Mons Argaeus;\nmajor concentric\nfaults bound the South Massif and\nthe East Massif.\nDeposits of Serenitatis ejecta must have been thick\nand

Isotopic dating of mare basalts\n(refs. 7-1 and 7-2) indicates\nthat mare volcanism\ncovered a timespan of 600 million years, beginning\napproximately\n3.7 billion years ago. Similar studies of\nbreccias (refs. 7-3 and 7-4) indicate an intense period\nof crystallization\nand an inferred formation\nof less\nthan 200 million years, beginning approximately\n4.0\nbillion years ago. Some anorthositic\nbreccias from the\n2- to 4-ram fragments\nof Apollo\n16 soils have\n\nresembled\nyoung\ncinder\ncones southeast\nof the\nSerenitatis\nbasin in the Taurus-Littrow\nregion (ref.\n7-6). Steep-walled\nvalleys with over 2000 m of relief\nwere also evident in this area. The possibility\nof\nrelatively\nyoung\nvolcanic\nactivity\nand mountains\nconsisting of a sequence\nof old, large-scale ejecta\nblankets\nmade this an attractive\nsite for further\n\nsomewhat older crystallization\nages of approximately\n4.1 to 4.2 billion\nyears (ref. 7:5) and may be\nremnants of earlier periods of formation. The breccias\nhave undergone\nmany generations\nof crushing, partial\nmelting, and recrystallization,\nwhich has changed the\ninitial textures of rocks from the early lunar crust.\nThese data raise important\nquestions concerning\nboth lunar and solar-system history. Do the measured\nbasalt ages represent\na restricted\nperiod of lunar\nvolcanism, or is there evidence of younger or older\nvolcanism in the unsampled\nareas? Answers to such\n\nexploration.\nAnalysis of high-resolution\nphotographs\nobtained\nduring the Apollo 15 mission showed that a 6- to\n10-km-wide valley between the second and third rings\nof the Serenitatis\nbasin allowed\naccess to two\nsteep-sided mountains and a dark-mantled\nvalley floor\nthat might produce\nevidence\nof young volcanism\n(refs. 7-7 and 7-8). Detailed mapping provided five\nmajor photogeologic\nunits for sampling: dark mantling material,\na valley-f\'dling\nrock unit below the\nmantle, a light-gray mantle apparently\ndeposited by a\nslide or avalanche that spread across part of the valley\nfloor, a group of domical, closely spaced hills ranging\nfrom 1 to 5 km in diameter (Sculptured\nHills), and\ntwo steep mountains\n(North and South Massifs)with\nslopes showing\nseveral boulder\ntracks that\nwere\ntraceable from possible outcrops to the base of the\n\nquestions\nare crucial\nto understanding\nthe lunar\nthermal history and the origin of lunar magmas. Do\nthe ages of breccia formation\nrepresent a restricted\nperiod of the major impacts that shaped the lunar\nsurface, or have only the breccias associated with the\nlast few major impacts been sampled?\nAnswers to\nthese questions are of profound importance\nto studies\nof the particle flux and the accretionary\nhistory of\nthe early solar system. Are the breccias too highly\nmodified\nto identify\ninitial textures\nof the early\n\nslopes where some of the boulders lay within sampling range. These boulder tracks originated at various\nelevations on the massifs and may represent\nrock\ntypes from several different units in what might be a\nsequence\nof ejecta\nblankets\nfrom several major\nimpacts.\n\naThe team composition is listed in "Acknowledgments"\nat the end of this section.\n7-1\n\n7-2\n\nAPOLLO\n17PRELIMINARY\nSCIENCE\nREPORT\n\nThelunar\nmodule\n(LM)landed\nwithin200mof\nthe targeted\nlanding ointOat.20\xc2\xb009\'55N, long.\np\n\'\'\n30045\'57 \'\' E), and three\n\ntraverses\n\nwere\n\ncompleted\n\n2.

Many are crystalline breccias with\npetrographic\ncharacteristics\nthat indicate varying degrees of recrystallization\nor partial melting. Others are\nfriable and dark gray like the many regolith breccias\nof previous missions.

There also may be fine fibrous\nor plumose intergrowths\nof plagioclase and clinopyroxene. Traces of cristobalite,\ntridymite,\na needleshaped phase, and very fine (perhaps partly glassy)\nmaterial occur interstitially\nto the larger grains. The\nvitrophyres\n(now largely divitrified)\ncontain skeletal\ncrystals of olivine (fig. 7-3) that, in some instances,\ndisplay overgrowths\nof clinopyroxene,\nskeletal ilmenite and armalcolite,\nand a few patches of plumose\nintergrowths\nof plagioclase\nand pyroxene.\nFor a\ngiven sampling area, the entire range of textures\nmay be present.\nOpaque minerals in the subfloor basalts are present\nin abundances\nof as much as approximately\n25\npercent\nCoy volume);\nmost rocks average approximately 20 percent.\nIlmenite,\narmalcolite,\nchromespinel, ulvospinel, rutile, metallic iron-nickel (Fe-Ni),\nand troilite have been identified optically; all of these\nminerals occur in most of the rocks.

Vitrophyric and\nfine-grained basalts are rich in prisms and lozengeshaped grains of armalcolite rimmed by a selvage of\nilmenite. Trace amounts of chrome-spinel and chromium-ulvospinel occur in almost all basalts; ulvospinel commonly shows evidence of subsolidus reduction to ilmenite and metallic Fe. Metallic Fe occurs as\nblebs in troilite and as discrete grains that are similar\nto the Fe seen in other mare basalts.\nThe similarity of basalt composition and textural\nvariation throughout the Apollo 17 landing site\nsuggests a similar source for all of these rocks.

The\ndegree of both vesicularity and development of\npoikilitic texture varies significantly from sample to\nsample, and, in some cases, the vesicles or vugs are\nseveral centimeters across. Mineral clasts of olivine\nand plagioclase and a few lithic clasts comprise a\nsmall percentage (5 t o 20 percent) of each rock. One\nof these breccias (sample 76055) contains two distinct textures: a poikilitic and almost nonvesicular set\nof fragments in a nonpoikilitic and vesicular matrix in\nwhich the vesicles are planar and well foliated,\ncurving around the more dense fragments as in a flow\nstructure.\nThe matrix of the green-gray breccias generally\nconsists of at least 50 percent poikilitic orthopyroxene (some may be pigeonite) with numerous small\nlaths of plagioclase both inside and outside the\noikocrysts (fig. 7-7). Small olivine grains occur in the\noikocrysts, but they are generally concentrated along\nwith opaque minerals outside the oikocrysts. A few\nrounded to angular larger clasts, scattered throughout\nthe rock, consist primarily of plagioclase and olivine.\nThe oikocrysts range from well developed (as much as\n2 mm long and enclosing 70 percent of the matrix) to\npoorly developed (as much as 0.1 mm long and\nenclosing 5 percent of the matrix). Lithic clasts are\nquite rare and are chiefly feathery to equigranular,\nfine grained, and plagioclase-rich.\nGreen-gray breccia occurs as a major rock type\ncollected from boulders and smaller rocks sampled at\nstations 2, 6, and 7 and as smaller fragments in the\nlight mantle at station 3; it must be considered as a\n\n-0\n\ncm\n\n3\n\nFIGURE 76-Green-gray breccia (sample 76015).

These rocks are similar in texture, mineralogy, and chemistry to the poikilitic rocks collected\nat the Apollo 16 site (ref. 7-10). The green-gray\nbreccias are also chemically similar to the brown-glass\nmatrix breccias collected at the Apennine Front (ref.\n7-1 1).\n\nBlue-Gray Breccias\nThe blue-gray breccias form the most complex\ngroup of rocks. This group consists predominantly of\na very coherent, slightly vesicular, blue-gray matrix\ncontaining angular to subrounded white clasts (fig.\n7-8). There are some cases where the blue-gray\nbreccias seem to exist as fragments in a tan matrix, or\nthere may be a banded relationship between blue-gray\nand tan matrix breccias (fig. 7-9). These rocks have\nno poikilitic matrix but may contain poikilitic clasts\nas well as mineral clasts of plagioclase, pyroxene, and\nsubordinate olivine. Many of these mineral grains\nhave been shocked. A few mineral clasts have\nfine-grained rinds that may have been partially glassy\nat some stage of development. The matrix also\ncontains traces of glass (sample 73235) or divitrified\nglass and displays some thin bands and oriented clasts\n\nPRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF LUNAR SAMPLES\n\n7-9\n\n3\n\n0\n\ncrn\n\nFIGURE 7-8.-0ne of the more vesicular varieties of blue-\n\n.s\n\n-0\n\nmm\n(a)\n\n0\n(b)\n\ngray breccia (sample 72435).

There\nis some variability in the coherence of the light-gray\nbreccias, apparently as a result of the degree of\nannealing of an originally glassy matrix, some of\nwhich remains as glass. On a macroscopic scale, these\nbreccias are nonvesicular t o very slightly vesicular. A\nlarge proportion of clasts in these breccias have white,\nfeldspar-rich cores rimmed by a dark-gray glass-rich\nmaterial. In the less coherent breccias, clasts stand\nout in relief on eroded surfaces. On both macroscopic\nand microscopic scales, there occur white veins,\nlayers, and lenses that, in some cases, appear to\nintrude the light-gray matrix (fig. 7-1 1).\nThe light-gray matrix consists of numerous small\nfragments of lithic debris, plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene, and opaque minerals set in a brown, glassy to\nvery fine devitrified mesostasis. The white veins and\nlenses contain no brown interstitial material but\nconsist of a few lithic fragments of the gray matrix\nbreccias and mineral debris that is largely feldspathic.\nMineral fragments are mostly plagioclase but also\ninclude olivine, pyroxene, and spinel. Lithic fragments are primarily breccias but also include anorthositic types, basalts, and poikilitic rocks. Some clasts\nshow accretionary structures consisting of brown,\nglassy matrix mantles surrounding lithic cores (fig.\n7-1 2). Breccia clasts within breccia clasts indicate a\ncomplex history for the formation of the light-gray\nbreccias.\nThis rock type is found as a boulder at station 2\nand among the smaller fragments in the light mantle\nat station 3 ; therefore, it appears to be associated\nwith the South Massif.\n\nBrecciated Gabbroic Rocks\nSeveral samples consist of brecciated or crushed\nanorthositic to gabbroic rocks.

The lighter areas that appear\nto be veins are essentially crushed crystalline material\n(AS 17-73- 1666 1).\n\nallowing possible reconstruction of original textures.\nFor example, a coarse norite (sample 78235) shows a\ngood cumulate texture on a macroscopic scale (fig.\n7-13), but it has undergone some crushing on a\nmicroscopic scale (fig. 7-14). Conversely, a gabbro\n(sample 78 155) has been highly crushed and may be\nmixed as well (fig. 7-15). One rock (sample 76535) is\na coarse-grained norite and shows no signs of having\nbeen sheared (fig. 7-16); although there are no thin\nsections of this rock, it may well have maintained its\noriginal texture. In another example (sample 7701 7),\nthe degree of crushing appears to vary from a margin\ninjected with glass veins to a less disturbed inner\nregion of cumulate plagioclase and olivine in clinopyroxene oikocrysts (fig. 7-17). Two crushed and\nrecrystallized anorthositic rocks were sampled from\nlarge clasts in the blue-gray breccia portions of the\nboulders at stations 6 and 7 and may present some\nclues to the source region of this breccia. Some of the\nless crushed and mixed samples of these originally\ncoarse-grained rocks may present the best opportunities from all of the Apollo missions for reconstructing\nthe textures and mineral compositions of rocks from\nthe early lunar crust.\n\nMiscellaneous Rocks\nThe miscellaneous rocks include a dunite sample\nfrom a large clast in one of the boulders at station 2\n\nFIGURE 7-1 2.-Thin sections of light-gray breccias.

The compositional\ndifferences observed between sample 75055 and the\nother two samples\nare too large to have been\nproduced by near-surface\ncrystal fractionation,\nindicating that at least two basalt\ntypes have been\nsampled at the Apollo\n\n17 site.\n\nMassif\nBasalts\n\nRocks\n\nBasalts exhibiting\nwide textural\nvariation\nhave\nbeen extensively sampled in the vicinity of Steno and\n\n7-17\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\nSouth\n\nRocks\nand North\n\nMassifs\n\nhave\n\nfrom\n\nbeen sampled at stations 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8. Analyses of\nrepresentative\nsamples are given in table 7-V. In\ncontrast to the wide textural and petrographic\nvariations observed in these rocks, two distinct, chemically\ndefined rock types can be recognized:\nnoritic breccias, corresponding\nto the petrographically\ndefined\nsuites of green-gray, blue-gray, and light-gray breccias;\nand anorthositic\ngabbros, corresponding\nto the petrographically defined suite of brecciated gabbroic rocks.\nThe latter group was found as clasts in the noritic\nbreccias and as isolated samples at stations 6, 7, and\n8. Figures 7-21 and 7-22 show that both rock types\n\nIn detail,\nthese basalts\nhave high TiO2 and\ncorrespondingly\nlow silica (SiO2) concentrations\nand\nare broadly\ncomparable\nwith basalts from Mare\n\nplot close to the plagioclase-control\ntrend that is\ntypical of highland rocks, particularly\nthose from the\nApollo 16 site.\nThe Apollo 17 noritic breccias are characterized\n\nCamelot Craters (stations\n1 and 5), the LM and\nApollo lunar surface experiments\npackage (ALSEP)\nsite, and also from Shorty Crater (station 4). Analyses\nof three of these samples are given in table 7-V. The\nbasalts are characterized\nby high FeO contents and by\ncorrespondingly\nhigh FeO/MgO (magnesia) ratios (fig.\n7-19); hence, they are similar to other mare basalts\nsampled at the Apollo 11, 12, and 15 and the Luna\n16 landing sites. These characteristics\nand low soda\n(Na20)\nconcentrations\nall terrestrial basalts.\n\nTranquillitatis\n(figs.\n(S) content of these\nthe Apollo 12 and\nwith the Apollo 11\n\ndistinguish\n\nmare basalts\n\n7-20, 7-21, and 7-22). The sulfur\nrocks, about twice that found in\n15 basalts, also compares closely\nbasalts. The Ni content (approxi-\n\nmately\n2 ppm),\nexceptionally\nlow even for lunar\nrocks, is much lower than in previously sampled mare\nbasalts.\nOne sample (75055) is slightly quartz normative\nand compares closely in both major and trace element\nchemistry with typical low potassium (K) Apollo 11\nbasalts.\nThe other two analyzed\nbasalts (samples\n70035 and 70215) differ from sample 75055 in that\nthey are olivine normative\nand higher in TiO2 (fig.\n7-20) and MgO than low-K Apollo 11 basalts, and are\ncorrespondingly\nlower in SiO2, AI2 03, CaO, and the\ntrace elements rubidium (Rb), zirconium (Zr), yttrium (Y), and strontium\n(Sr). Although\nchemically\ncomparable,\nthese two basalts differ\nin texture.\nSample\n70215\nis very free grained\n(probably\na\ndevitrified\nvitrophyre),\nwhereas sample 70035 is a\ncoarse-grained\n(1 to 2 mm) vesicular basalt. The\naphyric\ntexture\nof sample\n70215\nindicates\nthat\nhigh-titanium\nmagmas have been erupted\nonto the\n\nby approximately\n50 percent normative\nplagioclase\nand are broadly comparable\nin bulk chemistry with\nKREEP-like rocks sampled on previous missions (e.g.,\nsamples\n15265,\n62235,\nand 60315).\nThe noritic\nbreccias have slightly higher A1203 concentrations\nand MgO/FeO ratios than typical Apollo 14 breccias\n(fig. 7-21); in this respect, they are more closely\ncomparable\nwith the Apollo 16 KREEP-like\nrocks\n(figs. 7-21 and 7-22). Although closely comparable in\nmajor element\nchemistry,\nthe noritic\nbreccias are\nlower in Na2 O, potash (K2 O), and phosphorus\npentoxide (P20s)\nthan the Apollo 14 breccias, but they\nresemble the broadly defined composition\nof low-to\nmoderate-K Fra Mauro basalt composition\nproposed\nby Reid et al. (ref. 7-15) on the basis of glass\ncompositions\nin the Apollo 15 so\'ils. Elements that\nare abundant\nin KREEP, such as Rb, Y, Zr, and\nniobium (Nb), are also lower in these rocks than in\nthe Apollo 14 breccias. Figure 7-23 shows that, in\ncomparison\nwith their abundances\nin Apollo\n14\nbreccias, these elements\nare depleted in rocks with\nthe major element composition\nof KREEP from the\nApollo 17, 16, and 15 sites.

In\naddition to compositional\ndistinctions,\nselenographic\ndistinctions\ncan be made among these three groups.\n"Dark Mantle"\nMateriaL-Soil\nsamples taken at\nstations\n1 and 5 are considered\nto be the best\n\nsoils from the valley floor, and they are intermediate\nin major element chemistry between the basalts and\nthe light mantle soils (figs. 7-19, 7-21, and 7-22).\nHowever, these soils are depleted in K, Zr, and Y with\nrespect\nto a simple\nmixture\nof these two end\ncomponents.\nThis fact is illustrated\nin the case of Zr\nin figure 7-24. Thus, in these soils, anorthositic\ngabbro is more abundant\nrelative to noritic breccias\nthan it is in the light mantle soils, suggesting that\nanorthositic\ngabbro may be more abundant\nin the\n\ncandidates\nfor "dark mantle" material, particularly\nsample 75061,\na soil sampled from the top of a\nboulder. The samples are of uniform chemistry and\nare compositionally\nvery close to the subfloor basalts\n(figs. 7-19, 7-21, 7,22, and 7-24), which, together\nwith orange-glass fragments, constitute approximately\n80 percent of these soils. The remainder is accounted\nfor by aluminous material from the adjacent massifs.\nSoils from station 4 and the LM-ALSEP site are\nslightly more aluminous\nand less mafic than the\nstation 1 and 5 soils, containing\nslightly more of the\nmassif component.\nThe Ni content\nof these soils is fairly constant,\naveraging approximately\n120 ppm in the station 1\nand 5 soils, but it increases with the increasing\naluminous component\nin the other soils. Because the\nbasalts, which account for the bulk of these soils, are\nvery low in Ni (table 7-V), most of the Ni in the soil\nis probably\nof meteoritic\nderivation,\ncorresponding\nroughly with a 1-percent chondrite component.\nLight Mantle Material.-Light\nmantle, derived from\nthe South Massif, has been sampled at stations 2, 2A,\nand 3. These soils are the most aluminous sampled at\nthis landing site, and, apart from a small (5 percent)\nbasaltic component,\nthey are intermediate\nin both\nmajor and trace element\nchemistry\nbetween\nthe\nnoritic breccias and anorthositic\ngabbros (figs. 7-19,\n7-2.1, 7-22, and 7-24). If the light mantle is representati_)e of the South Massif, it implies that the massif is\ncomposed\npredominantly\nof noritic\nbreccias and\nanorthositic\ngabbros\nin roughly\nequal proportions.\nThe average Ni content of these soils is approximately\n220 ppm. If one allows for the high Ni in the source\nrocks (approximately\n100 to 120 ppm), which may\nalso be of meteoritic origin (during an earlier phase of\nlunar history),\nthen the meteoritic\ncomponent\ninferred for these soils is approximately\n1 percent, similar\nto that previously inferred for "dark mantle" soils.\nNorth Massif and Sculptured\nHills Material.-Soils\n\nNorth Massif or the Sculptured\nis in the South Massif.\n\nOrange\n\nHills (or both)\n\nthan it\n\nSoil\n\nThe orange soil (sample 74220) sampled at Shorty\nCrater is composed\nalmost entirely\nof glass and\ndevitrified\nglass spherules.\nIt differs markedly\nin\ncomposition\nfrom all other soils, including adjacent\nsoils from station 4 (table 7-VI), and is broadly\ncomparable\nwith the basalts, having high FeO and\nTiO2 concentrations.\nIn contrast to these rocks, the\norange soil contains 14.4 percent MgO and could be\nderived from the basalt composition\nby the addition\nof approximately\n24 percent olivine (Fo66). However,\nboth the Sr and Rb abundances\n(table 7-VI) are too\nhigh in the orange soil with respect to the basalts,\nthus precluding a direct relationship\nbetween the two.\nThe Zn content of 292 ppm is exceptionally\nhigh for\nlunar materials (table 7-VI); the only other material\napproaching\nthis composition\nis the Apollo 15 green\nglass (60 to 100 ppm) (ref. 7-18). The high volatile\nelement content of the orange soil (in addition to Zn\nand abundant chlorine (C1), found semiquantitatively\nduring preliminary\nexamination\nand confirmed by G.\nW. Reed (personal communication))\nimplies a source\ndifferent\nfrom that of the basalts, irrespective\nof\nwhether the glass in the soil is of volcanic or impact\norigin. Furthermore,\nthe high Zn content cannot be\nattributed\nto any reasonable\nlevel of meteoritic\ncontamination\nduring impact.\nBecause Zn concentrations\n\nin both the basaltic\n\nand\n\nmassif rocks are low, approximately\n2 to 5 ppm, the\nhigher concentrations\nobserved\nin the soils (table\n7-VI) must reflect the orange-glass (or its devitrified\nderivatives) content of these soils. On this basis, the\norange-glass content is highest in the other soils from\n\n7-22\n\nAPOLLO\n\nTABLE\n\n17\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\n7-VI.-X-Ray\n\nSCIENCE\n\nFluorescence\n\nREPORT\n\nAnalyses\n\nof\n\nApollo\n\n1 7 Soils\n\na\nSample\n\nor element\n\n74220,3\n(b)\n\nComponent\n\n75061,4\n\n71041,3\n\n71501,3\n\n]\n\n75081,3\n\n71061,3\n\n70161,3\n\n74240,3\n\nAbundance,\n38.57\n\n39.74\n\n8.81\n\n10.31\n\n9.57\n\n9.52\n\n9.41\n\n9.32\n\n8.99\n\n8.61\n\nA1203\nFeO\n\n6.32\n\n10.42\n\n10.80\n\n11.13\n\n11.31\n\n10.70\n\n11.60\n\n12.54\n\n22.04\n\n18.19\n\n17.73\n\n17.41\n\n17.20\n\n17.85\n\n17.01\n\n15.84\n\nMnO\n\n.30\n\n39.82\n\n40.27\n\n40.09\n\n40.78\n\n39.32\n\nTiO 2\n\nSiO 2\n\n40.34\n\n.24\n\n.24\n\n.24\n\n.25\n\n.25\n\n14.44\n\n9.53\n\n9.72\n\n9.51\n\n9.59\n\n9.92\n\n9.79\n\n9.15\n\n7.68\n\nMgO\nCaO\n\n.25\n\n.23\n\n10.72\n\n10.72\n\n10.85\n\n10.97\n\n10.59\n\n10.98\n\n11.36\n\nNa 20\n\n.36\n\n.33\n\n.35\n\n.32\n\n.33\n\n.36\n\n.32\n\n.38\n\nK_O\n\n.09\n\n.08\n\n.08\n\n.07\n\n.08\n\n.08\n\n.08\n\n.12\n\nP2Os\nS\n\n.04\n\n.06\n\n.07\n\n.06\n\n.07\n\n.07\n\n.08\n\n.09\n\n.07\n.75\n\n.13\n.48\n\n.13\n.47\n\n.12\n.46\n\n.12\n.46\n\n.13\n.49\n\n.12\n\n.14\n\n.46\n\n.41\n\nCr_ 03\nTotal\n\n99.47\n\nQuartz\nOrthoclase\nAlbite\n\n99.82\n\n99.62\n\n99.52\n\n100.06\n\n99.84\n\n100.00\n\n99.66\n\nm\n\n.53\n\n2.96\n\n26.72\n21.37\n\n20.13\n\n22.84\n\n24.32\n\n5.31\n\n6.22\n\n5.01\n\n16.73\n\nIlmenite\n\n2.79\n\n15.36\n18.43\n\nDiopside\nHypersthene\nOlivine\n\n.47\n\n3.05\n\nAnorthite\n\n.47\n\n19.58\n\n18.18\n\n18.08\n\n.09\n\nApatite\nTotal\n\n27.66\n\n20.25\n23.63\n\n.15\n\n99.21\n\n.47\n\n.47\n\n.47\n\n2.79\n\n28.73\n\n20.54\n22.83\n\n.13\n\n98.65\n\n.41\n2.71\n\n3.05\n\n2.71\n\n29.14\n20.33\n\n27.35\n\n29.98\n\n24.05\n\n20.29\n23.76\n\n19.64\n23.38\n\n4.67\n17.87\n\n6.46\n17.70\n\n5.99\n17.07\n\n.13\n\n99.01\n\n.15\n\n98.95\n\n.71\n3.22\n\n.15\n\n99.47\n\n32.16\n19.33\n23.09\n4.06\n16.35\n\n.17\n\n99.23\n\n.20\n\n99.41\n\n99.12\n\nAbundance,\n205\n\n8r\n\n166\n\nRb\n\n165\n\n1.2\n\nY\n\n49\n\nZr\n\n1.6\n\n182\n\n157\n\n83\n237\n21\n\n19\n\nNi\n\n83\n\n115\n\nZn\n\n292\n\n25\n\nbOrange\n\nperformed\nsoil (Apollo\n\nShorty\n\nCrater,\n\nlowest\n\nin\n\nmately\n\n5\n\nmately\n6\n\nlight\n\npercent.\n\nfrom\n14\n\ncontain\n\nfloor.\n\nK.

From X-radiographs,\nthe estimated\nlength of returned\nsample was 294.5\ncm (9.66 ft) out of a potential\nreturn of 322.5 cm\n(10.6 ft). Because drilling became difficult\nand was\nstopped with 30 -+ 2 cm of the drill stem still above\nthe lunar surface, a void of similar length at the top\nof the core was expected.\nActual\nempty\nspace\noccupied approximately\n27 cm, but it was distributed\nunevenly. There was a 15-cm void at the top of\n70009, a 2-cm void at the top of 70008, and an\nestimated\n10-cm void in the top half of 70007 (the\ntop 2 cm of 70007 were empty, and the next 16 cm\nwere approximately\nhalf full of loose material,\nsloping\nfrom empty\nto completely\nfull). Hence,\nrecovery of actual material sampled is close to 100\npercent. Stratal separation\ntook place at the top of\n70007; apparently,\nthe soil of the upper two sections\nmoved as a plug, possibly aided by air of pressurization entering through the connection between 70007\nand 70008.\nIn gross aspect, the deep drill core contains three\nmajor\nstratigraphic\nintervals:\nan upper,\nmassive,\ncoarse-grained\ninterval\ndominated\nby basaltic and\ncrystalline rock fragments; a middle, very-free-grained\ninterval dominated\nby anorthositic\nfragments; and a\nlower distinctly stratified\nof breccias and crystalline\n\ninterval containing a variety\nfragments (fig. 7-27).\n\nThe upper\ninterval,\nwhich includes\nunits\n52\nthrough 64, is 107 cm thick (from the lunar surface),\ncharacteristically\nmassive and coarse grained,\nand\nmore poorly stratified than the rest of the drill string.\nPrincipal layering occurs near the top and bottom of\nthis interval. The uppermost\n17.5 cm contain\nfive\nlayers (units 60 through\n64), including\na basal,\nfine-grained, thin bed that is overlain by 14.5 cm of\nfining-upward\nsequence.\nConversely,\nunit 59, the\nmajor massive bed, is 61.5 cm thick and occupies the\nlower 7.5 cm of 70009, all of 70008, and the upper\n16 cm of 70007. This massive unit is packed with\npoorly sorted rock fragments; in 70008, which has\nbeen dissected,\nthese fragments\nshow an upward\nsuccession\nfrom soil breccias,\nthrough\nmassive to\nflaky,\nblack,\ndevitrified\nglass, to fresh-appearing\nvesicular basalts and gabbroic anorthosites.\nVery little\nglass was found in this part of the core. Units 52\nthrough\n58 are fairly distinct and extend the coarsegrained interval to a depth of 107 cm. Basaltic and\ncrystalline rocks are dominant at the top of 70006.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nThe fine-grained middle interval, which is 56 cm\nthick, includes units 36 through 51 and contains a\nfew widely\nscattered\ncoarse rock fragments.\nThe\nsample removed\nfrom the top of 70005 contains\nsmall, anorthositic\nrock fragments and a few breccias;\nX-ray characteristics\nindicate\nsimilar texture\nand\ncomposition\nthroughout\nthe interval.\nThe 131.5-cm-thick\nbasal interval, which is heterogeneous and well stratified, includes units 1 through\n35. Although there are some units over 10 cm thick\nand others less than 0.5 cm thick, most range from 2\nto 5 cm. Similarly, although\nsorting ranges from very\npoor to good and grain size ranges from medium\ncoarse to very fine, most soils of this interval are well\nsorted and fine grained. Samples removed from the\ntop of sections 70004, 70003, and 70002, and from\nthe dissected bit, 70001, tend to be fine grained and\nmoderately\nwell sorted, with a small percentage\nof\ncoarse fraction dominated\nby soil and glassy matrix\nbreccias. Although vesicular basalts and gabbros are\npresent, they are subordinate\nto glasses and breccias.\nField and stratigraphic\ndata suggest the following\ntentative\nsubfloor regolith stratigraphy\nand history.\nThe lower interval, with its many thin layers, relatively fine grain size, good sorting, and abundance of\nbreccia and glass, was deposited\neither slowly by\naccretion over a long period of time or rapidly with\nextensive reworking\nover a long period of time. The\nmiddle interval, which is fine grained, relatively well\nsorted, and rich in powdery anorthosite,\ncould signify\neither the culmination\nof the working\nand slow\naccretion\nof beds of the lower interval or the distal\nend of a landslide from one of the massifs.\nThe upper interval appears to be associated with\nevents that produced\nnearby craters. The lower strata\n(fig. 7-28) may be ejecta from subdued older craters,\nsuch as Poppy and San Luis Rey. In 70008,\nthe\nreverse stratigraphic\nsequence of soil breccia through\nglassy breccia to crystalline rocks, the abundance\nof\nfresh-appearing\nplagioclase,\nand the scarcity of breccia and spatter glass are taken as evidence to indicate\nthat the main unit accumulated\nby rapid deposition,\nprobably from the Camelot cratering event. The thin,\nfine-grained\nbed above unit 59 may represent\nan\neroded and pulverized horizon.\nThe uppermost,\nfining-upward,\nthin-bedded\nsequence (units 61 through\n64) is tentatively\ninterpreted\nto be base surge ejecta\nfrom nearby Rudolph Crater, which does not contain\ncoarse, blocky, subfloor ejecta. This sequence was not\nfound\nin drive tube 70012,\nwhere a hard layer\nprobably\n\nrepresents\n\nthe packed\n\nfragmental\n\nunit.\n\nPRELIMINARY\nDepth,\ncm\n\nEXAMINATION\n\nOF\n\nLUNAR\n\nSAMPLES\n\n7-29\n\nUnit\n._...\n\n9 Matrix:\n\ndF._,\n\n\',\n\nUNIT 9\nDepth: TDS, 286.5 to 289 cm; lunar\nThin interval with scattered mottles.\n\n_ar\'\n\xe2\x80\xa2 .i.\n\xe2\x80\xa2..=,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n..\n\n95 percent;\n\nCoarse fraction:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.\n\nmoderately\n\ntransparent,\n\nsurface,\n\nindistinctly\n\n5 percent; semiopaque, indistinct\n\n259.5 to 262 cm\ngranular,\n\noutline,\n\nThickness:\n\n2.5 cm\n\nwith a trace of pinpoint opaques.\n\n2- to 5-mm crenulate\n\n8\nthe interval.\n_ UNIT 8\nDepth:TDS, 289 to 290 cm; lunar surface,262 to 263 cm\nI Thin bed with small, sortedrock fragments.\n\nmottles scattered randomly\n\nthroughout\n\nThickness:I cm\n\n-- Matrix:80 percent;high transparencyw th pinpointopaques, as in unit7.\n6\n_-t,I\n\n-\n\nCoarse fraction: 0 percent;semiopaque with moderatelydistinct\n2\noutline,I to 3 mm in diameter,wellsorted,chip-shaped\nfragments with relatively\nstraight\nmargins and angular corners.

Although\nlunar surface photographs indicate massive boulders on or near the rim of\nVan Serg Crater, the largest surficial fragments in the\ncore area range from 20 to 2 cm (ref. 7-27), are\npoorly sorted, angular, and unfllleted,\nand cover less\nthan 3 percent\nof the surface.\nA 12-cm trench\napproximately\n1 m southwest of the coring site has\nmedium-gray soil in the upper 7 cm but has light-gray\nto whitish soil in the lower part. The upper portion\nmight\nrepresent\n"dark\nmantle"\nover the ejecta\nblanket from Van Serg Crater. However, this color\nchange is not reflected\nin the X-radiograph\nof the\ndrive tube, possibly because the core is permeated by\nfractures,\nwhich are undoubtedly\na result of rocks\nbeing jammed\n(fig. 7-33).\n\ninto the coring device\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAND\n\nduring sampling\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe unit that partly Idled and leveled the TaurusLittrow valley is mare basalt similar to that returned\nfrom Mare Tranquillitatis.\nEarly studies of the ages of\nboth the basalts and the orange glass (ref. 7-5)\nindicate that they are similar but slightly older than\nthe Mare Tranquillitatis\nsamples. Whether these samples represent\none or several flows is not clear\n(chemical data suggest at least two); but it is evident\nthat widespread\nvolcanism\ninvolving very-titaniumrich melts occurred over much of the eastern limb of\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nEXAMINATION\n\nOF LUNAR\n\nSAMPLES\n\n7-41\n\nUnit\n\nDepth,\ncm\n\nI,,....\n\n40\n\n-\n\nUNITS 2 and 3 Depth:36 to 50 cm Thickness:\n7.5 and6.5 cm\nMassivefine-grained gradedbedswith moreopaqueabove.\nThese twoseparate, but similar, units are described\ntogether.

A statistical study\nof footprint and LRV track depths has been used as a\nbasis for quantitative analysis of near-surface soil\nporosity. Premission orbital photographs and surface\nphotographs have indicated a number of boulder\ntracks on the steep slopes of the North Massif and\nSouth Massif. These tracks have been analyzed by\nusing the method of Hovland and Mitchell (ref. 8-6).\nAdditional quantitative estimates have been based on\nLRV track depths and other specific observations as\nnoted later in this section.\n\nRESULTS AND INTERPRETATIONS\nGeneral Soil Characteristics at the\nTaurus-Littrow Site\nSoil cover is present at all points visited in the\nTaurus-Littrow landing area. The surface is a similar\ncolor (gray and gray-brown) to that at the other\nApollo sites, although lighter soil layers were encountered at shallow depths in some areas and orangecolored soil was exposed in a limited zone on the rim\nof Shorty Crater (station 4). Surface textures range\nfrom smooth areas almost free of rock fragments\nthrough patterned ground to areas heavily concentrated with larger rocks and fragments. Variability in\nsoil properties is evident locally. Qualitative indications of this variability on a meter scale are provided\nin figures 8-1 to 8-3.\nSoil behavior during landing, walking, driving, and\nsampling was comparable to that observed during\nprevious missions. Dust was readily kicked up under\nfoot and by the LRV, tended to adhere to any\nsurface with which it came in contact, and inhibited\nnormal operations on several occasions.\nAs readily apparent from the study of lunar\nsurface photographs and from crew commentary,\ndisturbed areas on the lunar surface appear darker\nthan undisturbed areas, as has been the case at the\nprevious landing sites. Subsequent crew observations\nof the landing sites from lunar orbit indicated that\nthe disturbed areas were lighter than the undisturbed\nareas. This difference in appearance could indicate\nthat the apparent changes in surface color caused by\ndisturbance result from texture-related changes in\nalbedo that influence the appearance when viewed\n\nFIGURE 8-l.-Variable soil conditions in the vicinity of the\nsurface electrical properties (SEP) experiment as evidenced by variable depths of LRV tracks and footprints\n(AS 17-141-215 17).\ni\n\nFIGURE 8-2.-Variable soil conditions in the light mantle at\nstation 3 as evidenced by color differences (AS17-13821148).\n\nfrom different positions and at different Sun angles\nrather than from real color changes as a result of the\nexposure of new material. Alternatively, the different\nappearance might result from differences in scale\nbetween viewing from the surface and from orbit.\n\nSOIL MECHANICS\n\n8-3\nA Apollo 17 time before touchdown. sec\n\nApollo 15 time before touchdown, set\nApollo 14 time before touchdown, sec\n\n0\n0\n\n,,First\n.\xe2\x80\x98\n\nA\n\n- o- , + -p- I\n\n- -\n\n\\\n\n-10 -Ground elevatio\\\n(Apollo 17)I\n\nFIGURE 8-3.-Variable soil conditions inside Shorty Crater\n(station 4) as evidenced by different surface textures and\nslopes (AS17-137-21001).\n\nSoil Observations During Lunar Module\nDescent and Landing\nBoth the postmission descent trajectory data and\nthe crew comments indicate that the Apollo 17\ndescent was fairly rapid with vertical velocities of\napproximately 1 to 1.5 m/sec at altitudes of 60 to 70\nm above the lunar surface, slowing to somewhat less\nthan 1 m/sec at an altitude of approximately 15 to 20\nm. The descent was accompanied by a fairly constant\nforward velocity of approximately 0.7 m/sec in the\nfinal 20 m of descent. Thus, the lunar module (LM)\ncame in on an oblique trajectory similar to that of\nApollo 14 (fig. 8-4). Previous analyses and mission\nresults have shown that this kind of trajectory causes\nleast disturbance of the lunar surface material during\nlanding. In contrast, vertical descents, such as that of\nthe Apollo 15 LM, generate substantial amounts of\nerosion. Blowing dust was first observed at a height of\napproximately 20 m above the lunar surface but\ncaused no visibility difficulties during the final\ndescent; in fact, the surface remained clearly visible\nall the way to contact.\nThe descent engine was shut down approximately\n1 sec after contact was indicated, and the LM\ndropped to the lunar surface while maintaining some\nforward velocity. The crew noted that the rear (-Z)\n\ndust (Apollo 15)\n\n1\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98.Ground elevation\n(Apollo 15)\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nfootpad probably hit the lunar surface first and that\nthe primary shock absorber may have stroked\nslightly. Photographs (e.g., AS17-134-20388) show\nsome crumpling of the Mylar insulation on the lower\nportion of the leg, indicating a possible stroking of 1\nor 2 cm. This crumpling did not happen on any of the\nprevious missions. From the photographs, no crushing\nof or damage to the footpad can be observed.\nAs in the other landings, the descent engine\nexhaust swept the lunar surface in the vicinity of the\nlanding site. Compared to adjacent areas, there were\nrelatively fewer small rock fragments and soil clumps\nbeneath the LM, although rocks 10 cm in diameter\nand larger remained. The crew observed that there\nwere clear indications of the interaction of the\ndescent propulsion system exhaust gas with the lunar\nsurface to a distance of approximately 50 m from the\nLM .\nFrom the crew\xe2\x80\x99s comments during sampling, the\nlack of blowing dust during the final stages of the\ndescent does not appear to be caused by soil\nproperties different from those experienced in prior\nlandings. As noted in the subsequent sections, the\ngrain-size distribution, cohesion, and density of the\nsoil around the LM are similar to those previously\nestablished for lunar soil. This similarity tends to\nconfirm previous conclusions that the amount of\nblowing dust during a landing is directly related to\nthe descent trajectory and descent rate.\n\n8-4\n\nAPOLLO\nGrain-Size\n\nDistribution\n\nSoil\nAt\n\nthe\n\nhad\n\ntime\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nand\n\nSamplenumbers\n\nComposition\n\nthis\n\ndetermined\n\n17

Below the depth corresponding to any\ngiven combination of friction angle and cohesion, a\nplastic zone should develop, and there should be soil\nyielding that would lead to closure of the hole by\ninward squeezing of the soil.\nIf no yielding of the soil developed to a depth\ncorresponding to the length of the neutron flux probe\n(and little could have occurred because the probe\ndiameter is only slightly less than the hole diameter),\nthen the required strength parameters are as indicated\nby the vertical line in figure 8-10 at a depth of 2.1 m.\nEven for high friction angles (> SO"), a soil cohesion\nexceeding 1.O kN/m2 is required. Strength parameters\nof this magnitude are likely only for conditions of\nhigh relative density and would be consistent with the\nhard drilling discussed previously. High strength is not\nrequired for the full depth of the hole. Stability can\nbe maintained for conditions of strength increasing\nwith depth to satisfy figure 8-10 at any depth.\n\n2.5r\n\nFriction angle = 30\xc2\xb0\n\nDepth of borehole, m\n\nFIGURE 8-10.-Depth to bottom of the clastic zone in an\nopen borehole as a function of soil strength parameters.\n\nAlthough the open holes remaining after extraction of the drill stem suggest quite lugh strengths for\ndepths of approximately 2 m at both the Apollo 16\nand 17 sites, strengths of this magnitude are not\ncommonly encountered at shallow depths as indicated by the values determined by penetrometer\ntesting at the Apollo 16 site (ref. 8-1).\n\nBoulder Tracks\nMore than 300 tracks made by boulders rolling,\nbouncing, and skidding down lunar slopes were\nidentified by Grolier et al. (ref. 8-9) in the Lunar\nOrbiter photographs. The Apollo 17 mission provided\nthe first opportunity for a close study of these\ninteresting features because many tracks can be seen\non the Taurus-Littrow hills. Unfortunately, prints of\nthe 500-mm lunar surface photographs, which permit\nthe most detailed study of the tracks, were not\navailable to the soil mechanics team during the\npreparation of this report. Hence, the analyses, based\nmainly on 60-mm and premission orbital photographs, are tentative, and the results are subject to\nsubsequent refinement. In a qualitative sense, boulder\ntracks serve as exploratory trenches and can provide\ninformation about regolith thickness and history, and\nthe relative sharpness of track features provides some\nindication of soil movement after track formation.\nQuantitative analysis of boulder tracks, from\nwhich information can be derived relating to soil\nstrength and density, is possible. Studies of this type\nhave been reported by Filice (ref. 8-10), Eggleston et\nal. (ref. 8-1 l), Moore (ref. 8-12), Moore et al. (ref.\n8-1 3), and Hovland and Mitchell (ref. 8-6) for boulder\ntracks found in Lunar Orbiter photographs. The\nmethod in reference 8-6 is used here.

Many of the tracks appear as chains of\nsmall craters or skid marks, thus suggesting either a\n\nbouncing of the boulder downslope or an end-overend movement of a nonspherical boulder. The mechanisms that set the boulders in motion are not known;\nhowever, several possibilities are apparent. Material\n\nSOIL MECHANICS\n\n8-1 1\n\n------ Boulder tracks\nFIGURE 8-14.-Boulder tracks on the South Massif as seen from the LRV between the SEP site and\nstation 2 (track identifications are the same as for fig. 8-12) (AS17-135-20666).\n\nbuildup on the uphill side of a boulder or erosion on\nthe downhill side of a boulder could lead to instability. Cyclic thermal expansion and contraction\ncould lead t o a slow, continuous, downslope movement. Some tracks could have been caused by blocks\nthrown out of impact craters; seismic events could\nhave triggered other movements; and impact-induced\nground motions could have initiated some events.\nIn the following analysis, only those tracks were\nselected that appeared to have resulted from continuous rolling over a significant distance. For those cases\nwhere more than one boulder was located that could\nhave formed a given track, the most probable boulder\n\nwas chosen, and the track is identified by a number in\ntable 8-111. In those cases where there seemed little\nquestion about the causative boulder, the track is\nidentified by a letter. Track depths were estimated\nbased on the assumption that the associated boulder\nis spherical.\nSlope angles were deduced from a premission\ncontour map of the landing site. Soil friction angles\nwere deduced by the method described in reference\n8-6. In this method, the bearing pressure of the\nboulder during rolling is estimated based on boulder\nsize, track width, and an assumed rock density of 3.2\ng/cm3. The pressure is taken as the bearing capacity\n\n~\n\n8-12\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n------- Boulder tracks\nFIGURE 8-15.-Boulder tracks on the North Massif as seen from the LM (track identifications are the\nsame as for fig. 8-12) (AS17-147-22502).\n\nand is used with a bearing capacity equation adapted\nto the case of a rolling sphere. The resulting relationships between soil friction angle, slope angle, and\ntrack-width-to-boulder-diameter ratio are shown in\nfigure 8-16. A soil density of 1.6 g/cm3 and a\ncohesion of 1 kN/mZ were assumed. This value of\ncohesion is near the upper end of the range of\ncohesion values determined for the lunar soil thus far\n(refs. 8-1 and 8-4). The effect of an overestimation in\ncohesion by as much as a factor of 10 will lead to an\nunderestimation of friction angle of only 1" t o 2",\nhowever. An estimate of the variations in friction\nangle that are likely to result from errors in a\nmeasurement of track depth and width and in\nboulder size has been made (ref. 8-6). The analysis\nindicated that friction could differ by as much as f 2"\nbecause of measurement errors.\nThe frequency distribution of the soil friction\nangles derived from the boulder track data is shown\nin figure 8-17 and is generally compatible with the\nsoil gradations, densities, and porosities found at\nother locations on the Moon. Although the range is\nsimilar to that determined by other means (refs. 8-1\nand 8-4), the most frequent values are somewhat less\nthan would be expected because tracks of the size\nanalyzed must involve considerably greater soil\ndepths than for the other determinations. This\ndifference may reflect limitations in the analysis.\n\nThus, the variability indicated by figure 8-17 is\nconsidered more reliable than the absolute values of\nfriction angle.\n\nSurface Soil Porosity Deduced from\nFootprint Analysis\nPreviously developed methods (refs. 8-3 and 8-4)\nhave been used to extend the statistical analysis of\nlunar soil porosity as deduced from footprint depths\nto include the Apollo 17 site. The curve correlating\nfootprint depth with average porosity and relative\ndensity of the upper few centimeters of the lunar\nsurface, based on results of model test and theoretical\nanalyses (ref. 8-14), is shown in figure 8-18.\nA total of 144 different footprints from the\nApollo 17 photographs were analyzed, and the results\nare summarized in table 8-IV. A histogram showing\nall data for Apollo 17 is presented in figure 8-19. Also\nsummarized in table 8-1V are results for previous\nApollo missions. For the Apollo 17 site, only three\nfootprints on crater rims were analyzed. This sample\nsize is too small to characterize crater rims statistically; thus, the values shown in table 8-IV are\nessentially applicable only to intercrater areas.\nThe data in table 8-IV show that neither the\nintercrater average porosity (43.4 percent) nor the\nstandard deviation (2.4) differ significantly from the\n\nSOIL\n\nTABLE\n\nReference\n\n8-III.-Apollo\n\nno.\n\nFig. 8-12\n\nSculptured\nHills\n\nkm\n\n13\n\n17\n\n0.76\n\n3.0\n\n40\n\n10\n15\n6\n12\n16\n11\n10\n\n1.00\n.53\n.83\n\n5.0\n1.1\n1.3\n\n30\n49\n35\n\n1.00\n.62\n.82\n\n6.0\n1.7\n2.4\n\n30\n46\n37\n\n.80\n\n2.0\n\n37\n\n25\n25\n\n1.3\n1.4\n\n26?\n26?\n10\n11\nlO\n8\n11\n14\n12\n16\n1.5\n3.0?\n1.8\n5.0\n3.0?\n4.5\n6.0\n\n0.77\n.69\n.77\n.73\n.73\n1.00\n1.00\n.80\n\n2.4\n2.2\n2.2\n1.8\n2.4\n7.0\n6.0\n4.0\n\n39\n43\n39\n41\n42\n30\n30\n39\n\n3.0\n2.1\n\n1.00\n.86\n\n1.5\n0.5\n\n27\n\n3.0\n\n1.00\n\n1.5\n\n-\n\n8\n18?\n\n1.00\n-\n\n4.0\n-\n\n29\n-\n\n4.5\n8\n10\n9\n6\n8\n12\n\n.80\n.75\n.80\n.78\n1.00\n.88\n.71\n\n0.9\n1.4\n2.0\n1.7\n3.0\n2.1\n1.7\n\n35\n39\n38\n38\n28\n33\n41\n\n0.9\n\n27\n27\n27\n25\n25\n25\n\n.9\n2.5\n.5\n.4\n.6\n1.4\n\nc\n16\n17\n\n25\n25\n25\n\n.8\n_ .1\n_ .2\n\n25\n25\n25\n25\n25\n25\n\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\nd\ne\nf\n\nFig. 8-15\n\n27\n\n26\n26\n26\n24\n24\n24\n24\n26\n\n_ .5\n_ .5\n_ 1.8\n_ .1\n_ .7\n_ .9\n_ .4\n-_ .4\n\n7\n8\n10\n3.6\n6\n8\n7\n6\n\ng\nh\n\n24\n23\n\n_ 1.0\n_ 2.0\n\n7\n8.5\n\n.05\n.3\n.1\n.3\n.3\n.2\n\n*For tracks identified by a letter, a definite causative boulder\nmost probable causative boulder could be located.\nvalues\n\naverage\n\nstatistical\n\nfor\n\nwith\n\nApollo\n\nsites\n\nweighted\narithmetic\nwithout\n\nboth\n\nfor\nthe\n\n(44.0\n\nvalues\nvalues\n\nis\nApollo\n\npercent\n\nwere\nto the\n\npercent\nobtained\n\nof\n\nsites.\n\nslightly\n\nweighted\n\n(43.5\n\naverage\nregard\n\nApollo\n\npercent)\n\nparameters\n\nclosely\n\nweighted\n\nprevious\n\n(45.0\n\ndeg\n\n10\n8\n5\n12\n10\n9\n8\n\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n\n16\n\nangle,\n\nm\n\n1.3\n.6\n.6\n.5\n.9\n.7\n1.3\n1.7\n\n9\n\nFig. 8-14\n\naverage\n\nFriction\n\ndepth,\n\n23\n26\n26\n26\n26\n26\n26\n26\n\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\nNorth Massif\n\nD\n\n7?\n8?\n\nFig. 8-13\n\nMassif\n\nTrack\n\nw\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\na\nb\n\nFig. 8-12\n\nSouth\n\nTracks\nBoulder\ndiameter,\nD, m\n\nlength,\n\ndeg\n\nEast Massif\n\n1 7 Boulder\n\nTrack\n\nangle,\n\ne"\n\n8-13\n\nTrack\nwidth,\nw, m\n\nSlope\n\nTrack\n\nLocation\n\nMECHANICS\n\nthe\nnumber\n\n17\n\nalso\n\naverage\nand\n\nand\n\n2.55).\n\nby computing\naverages\n\nApollo\n\nfor\n\nof observations\n\nThe\n\ncompare\n\nvalues\n\n2.75)\nand\n\nThe\nhigher.\n\nfor all\n\n13\n16\n13\n11\n15\n14\n12\n20\n\n3.0\n\n2.0?\n\ncould be located;\n\none\n\nsite.\n\n(44.0\n16\n\nfor tracks identified\n\nConversely,\n\npercent)\nwhere\n\nan\n\nobservations\n\nthe\n\nis weighted\n\nweighted\nheavily\n\nunusually\n\nlarge\n\nwas\n\npossible.\n\npercent\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nun-\n\nvalues\n\nun-\n\nnumber\n\nbetter\nestimate\nfor a randomly\nthe lunar surface.\n\na simple\neach\n\nsite\nat any\n\nNo\nfound\n\ndistinguishable\nbetween\n\nthe\n\n2.55)\n\nthe\n\nonly the\n\nporosity\nof Apollo\n\nof\n\nfootprint\n\nunweighted\n\n17\n\nprobably\n\nrepresent\n\nselected\n\ndifference\nApollo\n\naverage\nin favor\n\nThus,\n\nThe\n\n(43.5\n\nby a number,\n\nlocation\n\nin\ntraverse\n\nporosity\nstations\n\na\non\n\nwas\nand\n\n8-14\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\n6O\n60\n\n\\\n\n50\n\n50\n\n40\n\n40\nio m\n\n30\n\ng 30\ng\n\n20\n\nm\n\n20\n\nW\n\n_\n\n10\n\n10\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n.2\n\n.4\n\n.6\n\n.8\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1.0\n\n.2\n\nI\n.4\n\nw/D\n\nI\n.6\n\nI\n\n.8\n\nI\n\n1.0\n\nw/D\n\n(a) Slope angle =\n\n0\xc2\xb0.\n\n(c) Slope angle = 20 \xc2\xb0.\n\n60-\n\n60\n\n50\n\n_\n\n50\n\n40\n\n40\n\n,,10 m\n\nD\n\ng 30\ng\n\n_,lo\n\nm\n"\'5 m\n\nu,.\n\nw- Ira,"\n\no=_3o\n._,\nL,L\n\n20\n\n20\nW\n\n1o\n\n10\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\n.2\n\n.4\n\n.6\n\n.8\n\n.J\n\n1.0\n\nI\n\n0\'\n\n.2\n\nl\n.4\n\nI\n.6\n\nw/D\n\nw/D\n\n(\'b) Slope angle = 10 \xc2\xb0.\n\n(d) Slope angle = 30 \xc2\xb0.\n\nFIGURE 8-16.-The\nrelationship\nbetween friction angle _ and track width to boulder diameter ratio\nw/D for lunar soil, where soil density Ps is 1.6 g/cm _;

All\nprevious lunar soil porosity estimates based on footprint depths were made on this basis, including the\nvalues in table 8-1V.\nRecent tests on three l-g samples of lunar soil (ref.\n8-2) have indicated\nthat values of maximum\nand\nmininmm porosities\nof lunar soil may differ significantly from those for lunar soil simulant from one\nApollo site to another,\nand perhaps locally within a\nsite.

It has been found\nthat it may be necessary to adjust the porosity values\nin table 8-IV upward by 7 percentage points or more.\nThe magnitude\nof the standard\ndeviation\nis affected only slightly by the adjustment.\nAny necessary\nadjustments\nto the porosity values in table 8-IV are\nexpected to have no influence on the accompanying\nvalues of relative\ndensity,\nbecause simulants\nand\nactual lunar soils are expected\nto behave similarly\nunder load when they exist at the same relative\ndensity.\nSuch adjustment\ncould\nbe expected\nto\ninfluence porosity estimates derived from analysis of\nLRV tracks as well.\n\nSoil Properties\nSoil/LRV\nInformation\nthe lunar surface\n\nDeduced\n\nfrom\n\nInteraction\n\non the interaction\ncan be extracted\n\ntions, photographic\ncoverage\nand real-time read-outs\nfrom\n\nof the\n\nLRV with\n\nfrom crew descrip-\n\nof the EVA activities,\nthe LRV ampere-hour\n\nintegrators and navigation system components.\nAs on the Apollo\n15 and 16 missions to the\nHadley-Apennine\nand the Descartes regions of the\nMoon, respectively,\nthe LRV developed\nexcellent\nflotation, and the interaction\nbetween the wheels and\nthe soil did not extend to any appreciable\ndepth\nbelow the lunar surface. The depth of wheel tracks\nwas, on the average, approximately\n1.25 cm and\nvaried from an imperceptible\namount to 5 cm, with\nthe high wheel sinkage developed at the rims of small\nfresh craters (fig. 8-20). In most cases, a sharp imprint\nof the chevron tread was clearly discernible, indicating that the surficial soil possessed some cohesion and\nthat the amount of wheel slip was minimal.\nOn the basis of crew debriefings,\nit appears that\nthe LRV was operated on slopes ranging from 0 \xc2\xb0 to\n20 \xc2\xb0 . The steepest slope angles were encountered\nat\nNorth Massif near station 8. The impression of the\ncrew was that, in negotiating that slope, the LRV was\napproaching\nthe limiting slope-climbing\ncapabilities.\nFrom wheel/soil\ninteraction\ntests performed\nwith\nprototype\nLRV wheels on crushed basalt lunar soil\n\n8-17\n\nSOIL MECHANICS\n\nthe vehicle wheel and the lunar soil surface was less\nthan 0.36.\nOn the basis of LRV track depth, shape, and\ntexture, there are no discernible variations in the\naverage consistency of the surficial soil throughout\nthe Taurus-Littrow region traversed during the Apollo\n17 mission. Similar observations were made at previous landing sites.\nThe LRV tracks and the tracks developed by the\nunmanned vehicle Lunokhod 1 at the Mare Imbrium\nlanding site of the Soviet spacecraft Luna 17 (ref.\n8-17) were analyzed by Costes (ref. 8-5). The analysis\nfollowed the general procedure for the modular\nequipment transporter tracks (Apollo 14) outlined in\nreference 8-18 but was modified t o account for the\nwheel characteristics and mode of operation of the\npowered LRV and Lunokhod vehicles.\nThe results of this analysis, shown in table 8-V,\nindicate that at least for the Apollo 14 through 17\nand Luna 17 landing sites, the surficial lunar soil\nappears to have similar mechanical properties regardless of initial origin, geologic history, gross chemical\ncomposition, or local environmental conditions.\nThese findings, which agree with the results of the\nfootprint analyses, are also corroborated by calculations on the LRV energy consumption at the Apollo\n15, 16, and 17 sites (fig. 8-21). These calculations\nwere made on the basis of one soil model that, for the\nApollo 15 mission, yielded the least root-mean-square\ndeviation from the measured energy consumption for\nall three EVA periods (ref. 8-19). The comparative\nanalysis for the Apollo 15 data had used 34 different\nsoil models, including soil mechanics data obtained at\nstation 8 of the Hadley-Apennine region from inplace penetrometer measurements, trenching, and\n\nFIGURE 8-20.-Typical LRV tracks on the lunar surface at\nthe Apollo 17 site.

As in previous missions, parking the vehicle on\nsteep slopes posed some problems because of its\ntendency to slide downslope.

(ref. 8-22) have assessed the relative\n\nimportance\nof vibrations\ninduced by meteoroid\nimpact as a mechanism for mass movement of lunar soil\ndownslope.\nThe seismic energy generated by impacts\nof various-size\nmeteoroids\nwas estimated,\nand the\nassociated\nincremental\nmovement\nwas computed\nfor\neach impact. Movements were summed over the range\nin meteoroid\nsizes producing\nsignificant\nmovement,\nboth with respect to distance from point of impact\nand with respect to time, using meteor flux rates\nderived by Gault (ref. 8-23) with an adjustment based\non more recent estimates of the age of the Moon.\nThe results indicated\nthat the flattest\nslope on\nwhich significant\ncumulative\ndownslope\nsoil movement of approximately\n1 m is likely to have occurred\nbecause of impact-produced\nground accelerations\nis\napproximately\n25 \xc2\xb0 . The flattest\nslope on which\ncumulative\ndownslope\nmovement\nof several hundred\nto a few thousand meters is likely to have occurred is\napproximately\n\n48 \xc2\xb0 . Because\n\nof the\n\ngreat\n\nlength\n\nof\n\nSOIL MECHANICS\n\nmost of the highland lunar slopes, it is estimated that\ndownslope movements of a few thousand meters\nwould be required to cause flattening of the slopes by\nas much as 1" or 2\'. Thus, it appears that only on\nvery steep lunar slopes could there have been significant downslope soil movements caused by shaking\nfrom meteoroid impacts alone, and that large-scale\nslope degradation must have developed primarily by\nother mechanisms. However, this conclusion does not\nmean that soil movement, once triggered by meteoroid impact, could not continue as a result of changes\nin strength properties of the soil mass or fluidization.\n\nOrigin of the Light Mantle\nIt has been hypothesized (ref. 8-24) that the light\nmantle that extends outward over the plains area\nnorth of the base of the South Massif (fig. 8-22)\noriginated as an avalanche from the slopes of the\n\n8-19\n\nSouth Massif. A study of stereographic photographs\nobtained from orbit during the Apollo 17 mission\nusing the panoramic camera gives some indication of\na scarp on the South Massif that could define the\nboundary of a slide mass. Furthermore, according to\nthe LSPET, the light mantle material on the plains\nappears to be compositionally similar to that from\nthe South Massif. Thus, reasonable evidence exists\nthat a slide or avalanche did occur. If a slide did\noccur, then an important question to be resolved is\nthe mechanism by which the material spread out onto\nthe valley floor and came to rest with a nearly level\nsurface.\nAs the slope of the South Massif is only approximately 25" to 30\xc2\xb0, meteoroid impact is unlikely to\nhave been able to do much more than just initiate\nmovement. Incremental movements accumulating\nfrom impacts alone could not account for the\nmagnitude of movements indicated. However, once a\n\nFIGURE 8-22.-0rbital view of the Apollo 17 landing area. The light mantle to the north of the South\nMassif may have been an avalanche produced by the mechanisms proposed in text. A possible slide\nscarp can be seen located as indicated on high-resolution panoramic camera photographs (Apollo\n17 panoramic camera frame AS17-2314).\n\n8-20\n\nAPOLLO\n17PRELIMINARY\nSCIENCE\nREPORT\n\nslidewastriggered, the soil strength\nif\nwereto\ndecrease\nsignificantly if themassecame\nor\nb\nfluidized\nbecause thegenerationliberation of significant\nof\nor\nquantities\n\nmovement\n\nmight be\n\nthose of the soils at the previous\nApollo sites.\nAlthough\nno crew tasks or lunar surface measurements were done specifically\nfor the purpose\nof\nobtaining quantitative\nsoil mechanics data, a number\n\nmovements\n\nreferred\n\nof preliminary\nanalyses and interpretations\nhave been\nmade using EVA transcripts\nand kinescopes,\nphoto-\n\nin soil strength was assumed\nThe nature\nof lunar soil\n\ngraphs, data on soil/LRV\ninteractions,\ndebriefings,\nand limited examination\nof returned lunar samples.\n\nof gas, then continued\n\npossible.\nIn the analysis\nto previously,\nonce failure\n\nof downslope\n\nno change\noccurred.\n\nparticles, particularly\nthe agglutinates\nand breccias, is\nsuch that particle breakdown\nduring shear is likely.\nThe results of strength and compression tests on lunar\nsoil samples by Carrier et al. (ref. 8-25) suggest that\nparticle breakdown\ndoes indeed occur. Mitchell and\nHouston (ref. 8-26) found that decreasing the particle\nsize of a basalt lunar soil simulant\nresulted\nin a\nsignificant decrease in the angle of internal friction. It\nis not likely, however,\nthat particle comminution\ncould lead to a decrease in friction angle to a value\nless than 25 \xc2\xb0 , which would be required to result in\nany slope flattening\non the South Massif. A loss in\nstrength caused by a friction-angle decrease sufficient\nto allow spreading of the material over the level plains\ndoes not seem possible.\nThe plausibility\nof fluidization\nas a mechanism\nhinges on the generation or liberation of sufficient gas\nduring the initial stages of movement\nto provide a\nsufficient uplift pressure on the overlying\nsoil to\nreduce or eliminate frictional resistance to downslope\nmovement.\nGas of solar wind origin was liberated in\nthe compression\nand strength\ntests described\nin\nreference 8-24; however, the amount was too small\nby orders of magnitude\nto cause fluidization.\nConversely, other investigators\nhave generated gas by a\ncombination\nof grinding and heating.\nClanton et al. (ref. 8-27) and Bogard et al. (ref.\n8-28) have confirmed that agglutinates are enriched in\nsolar wind and thus could serve as a source of gas\nwhen broken down. The Apollo 17 soil composition\nanalyses indicate that the samples from the massifs\ncontain\ngreater proportions\nof breccias,\napproximately the same proportion\nof agglutinates,\nand less\nbasalt than does the dark mantle material on the\nplains. Thus, a fluidization\nmechanism\nmay be tenable to account\nfor the origin of the light mantle,\nwhereas fluidization\nwould be very unlikely if the\nmassifs were composed only of ground-up basalt.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe physical and mechanical properties\nat the Apollo 17 landing site are generally\n\nof the soil\nsimilar to\n\nThe\n\nfollowing\n\nspecific\n\nconclusions\n\nhave\n\nbeen\n\nde-\n\nveloped.\n1. Soil cover is present at all points visited in the\nTaurus-Littrow\nlanding\narea. Surface textures\nand\ncolors are similar to those at the other Apollo sites.\n2. There is considerable\nlocal (meter scale) variability in soil properties.\n3. Particle-size\ndistributions\nof samples from different traverse stations are generally similar to each\nother and to those observed at previous landing sites,\neven though soil compositions\nare highly variable\namong the stations in terms of proportions\nof basalt,\nbreccia, mineral fragments, glass, and agglutinates.\n4. The drive-tube\nsamples indicate some increase\nin density with depth but more uniformity\nwith\ndepth\nthan the Apollo 15 and 16 samples. Soil\ndensity in the double drive tube taken on the rim of\nShorty Crater (station\n4) is higher than heretofore\nobserved for any lunar sample. The presence of high\nspecific gravity particles, such as ilmenite, is a more\nprobable cause than is very low porosity.\n5. Absolute densities at the Apollo 17 drill site are\ngenerally higher than those measured at the Apollo\n15 and 16 drill sites, and the distribution\nof densities\nwith depth suggests a different depositional\nhistory\nfrom that at the previous two sites.\n6. Stability analysis of the open drill-stem hole,\ninto which the neutron\nflux probe was placed and\nremoved without\nsoil resistance, indicates that there\nwas little or no squeezing or caving of the soil during\na 49-hr period and that soil strength at a depth of 2 m\nmust have been considerably\ngreater than the average\nstrength near the surface.\n7. Tracks caused by the rolling and bouncing of\nboulders are common on the slopes of the massifs and\nthe Sculptured\nHills. A frequency distribution\nof soil\nfriction\nangles was deduced\nfrom rolling boulder\ntrack data that is consistent with the soil gradations,\ndensities, and porosities found at other locations on\nthe Moon, although\nthe absolute values of friction\nangle were computed\nto be somewhat lower than was\nanticipated.\n8.

The major contribution\nto the surface heat\nflow comes from heat generated by the disintegration\nof long-lived\nradioisotopes\nof uranium\n(2asu and\n2aaU), potassium\n(4\xc2\xb0K), and thorium (2a2Th).

Because\nof the very low\nthermal conductivity\nof the lunar soil, this heat is\ndissipated very slowly. Even after 45 days, some of\nthe thermometers\nindicated continued\ncooling.\nIn general, the rate of equilibration\nof each probe\nsensor to the surrounding\nlunar medium depends on\nseveral different\nparameters,\nincluding thermal and\ngeometrical\nproperties\nof the probe[borestem\nsystem,\nthermal properties\nof the adjacent lunar medium, the\nthermal\ncontact\nbetween\nthe borestem\nand the\nadjacent zone of disrupted\nlunar material, and the\ntotal heat energy excess of the system upon completion of drilling. For long times (t > 20 hr) after the\nprobes are inserted, however, the probe sensor temperatures\nabove equilibrium\ndepend essentially\non\ntwo quantities, the total initial energy excess per unit\nlength of the system AE and the thermal conductivity\nof the adjacent\n\nregolith\n%(t)\n\nkm.\n\n- T\n\n= AE/h_%t\n\n(9-2)\n\nwhere Tp(t) is a probe sensor temperature\nat time t\nsince emplacement\nand T is the equilibrium\nsensor\ntemperature.\nThe form of equation\n(9-2) has been verified by\nfinite difference\nmodels and by analytical solution\nappropriate\nto simplified distribution\nof _ between\nthe probe and borestem.\nThe analytical\nsolution,\nwhich takes the form of equation\n(9-2) for long\ntimes, is described in detail in the appendix of section\n11 of reference 9-1 I.\nEstimates of the regolith conductivity\nk m can be\nmade from the long-time cooldown data using equation (9-2) once a value for &E is assumed. Because of\nthe uncertainties\nof the contribution\nof the drilling\nprocess to the total excess heat energy, two different\nassumptions\nhave been made in regard to the z&E\nterm. First, it was assumed that drill-heating effects\nare negligible and that all excess heat energy initially\nresides in the probe and borestem.\nThe probe and\nborestem\nwere assumed\nto be at the same initial\ntemperature\nTo after drilling, as measured\nby the\nprobe sensors. For this assumption,\nthe initial energy\nexcess can then be expressed simply as\n\nt_ =(Sp+\n\nSb)(T\n\no - T,_)\n\n(9-3)\n\n9-5\n\nwhere Sp and S b are the heat capacities\nper unit\nlength of the probe and borestem, respectively.\nThe\nresultant problem\nhas an analytical solution\nthat is\nused to determine\nregolith\nconductivity\nestimates\nfrom the cooldown\ndata. These assumptions\nconstitute the minimum initial energy case.\nFor a maximum\ninitial energy estimate,\nit was\nassumed that a 2.2-mm thickness of disrupted\nlunar\nmaterial had received enough heat during the drilling\nprocess to attain an initial temperature\nequal to that\nof the probe and borestem. The 2.2-mm contact zone\nthickness was chosen to correlate with the difference\nin drill bit radius and borestem\nradius. The subsequent cooldown\nproblem was then solved, assuming\nradial heat dissipation,\nby using a finite difference\nmodel.

The noon temperature increases approximately\n6 K from aphelion to\nperihelion. The mean temperature\n(i.e., surface temperature averaged\nover a lunation)\nvaries approximately 3 K throughout\na year. Although the amplitude of the annual cycle is one-hundredth\nof the\ndiurnal variation, the decay constant _i is x/_ times\nsmaller; consequently,\nannual variations\npenetrate\ndeeper and induce significant heat flows to depths of\na few meters and must be considered in the interpretation of the experimental\nresults. The attenuation\nof\namplitude and the increase in phase lag for the annual\nwave are shown in figure 9-3 as a function of depth.\nAnnual wave effects shown in figure 9-3 are based on\nthe conductivity\nprofile at Rima Hadley.\nAs shown in figure 9-3, temperature\nfluctuations\nattributable\nto the diurnal cycle become virtually\nundetectable\nat depths > 100 cm and would have had\nlittle effect on heat flow below this depth before the\nprobe and borestem\nwere emplaced.\nOnce the borestem is emplanted in the regolith, the higher conductivity of the borestem and the radiative transfer inside\nthe borestem will enhance the downward propagation\nof thermal waves. However, thermometers\nat 130 cm\nbelow the surface do not detect any temperature\nvariation\n\nduring a lunation\n\ncycle.\n\nCorrections\nfor the Shunting\nEffects\nof the Borestem and Probe\nThe axial conductance\nof the epoxy borestem\nis\nconsiderably\nhigher than that of a vertical column of\nlunar soil of equal cross section. This fact, combined\nwith the finite length of the borestem, results in some\nshunting of the steady-state\nheat flow through the\nborestem to the surface. Certain short sections of the\nborestem, such as the bit and joints, are made of\ntitanium or steel, and sizable disturbances\noccur near\nthese parts. A second related effect results from the\nfact that the probes are radiatively coupled to the\nborestem walls and have a small axial conductance.\nConsequently,\nthe probe bridges register\nslightly\nsmaller temperature\ndifferences than those registered\nat points on the borestem next to sensors.\n\nSCIENCE\nThese\n\nREPORT\n\neffects\n\ncan\n\nbe\n\nestimated\n\nby\n\nsimplified\n\nanalytical\nmodels and by laboratory\nexperiments;\nboth methods were used in the earlier analysis of the\nApollo\n15 results.\nHowever,\nfor the Apollo\n17\nanalysis and the refined Apollo 15 results presented\nin this report, a numerical\nmodel of the probe in a\nmedium in which heat is flowing parallel to the probe\naxis has been used. The numerical\nmodel is more\ndetailed and allows examination\nof certain combined\neffects that\nmodels.\n\nare difficult\n\nto estimate\n\nwith\n\nanalytical\n\nThe numerical\nmodel\ncomputations\nshow that\nthe borestem and probe disturbances\nto the steadystate heat flow are small. In the extreme case, the\ntemperature\ndifference\nacross a probe section is 7\npercent lower than the temperature\ndifference across\nthe same vertical\ndistance\ninterval\nfar from the\nborestem.\nThe numerical\nmodel has been used to\napply corrections\n\nto all probe observations.\n\nR ESU LTS\nApollo\n\n17 Subsurface\n\nTemperatures\n\nThe HFE was turned on while probe 2 was being\ninserted into the borestem,\nand temperatures\nwere\nrecorded only minutes after drilling was completed.\nThese temperatures\nranged from 295 to 301 K. The\nearly cooling histories of probe 1 indicate similar\ninitial temperatures.\nAfter emplacement,\nthe probes\ncool toward the undisturbed\nregolith temperatures.\nThe temperature\nhistories of all sensors deeper than\n65 cm for the first 45 days are shown in figure 9-4.\nAfter 45 days, some sensors are continuing\nto cool;\nhowever, the expected future temperature\ndecrease is\nprobably less than the error of absolute temperature\nmeasurement.\nThe equilibrium\ntemperature\ndifferences\nabsolute\ntemperatures\nof each sensor are\ntable 9-II.

In the inset, the temperature rise for times > 1000 min is shown on an expanded scale\nplotted against the logarithm of time. The observed data are compared with two bracketing\ntheoretical curves. The reduced conductivity is 2.64 W/cm-K.\nA rough\ncorrelation\nexists between\nthe drill\npenetration\nrate during borestem\ndrilling and the\nmeasured\nconductivity.\nThe more resistant\nlayers\nwhere the drill penetrated\nslowly correspond\nto\ndepths where higher conductivity\nis observed.\nThe\nmore\nresistant\nlayers likely correspond\nto more\ncompacted\nregolith materials or possibly to a higher\nconcentration\nof centimeter-size\nrock fragments.\nEither of these phenomena\ncan increase the bulk\nconductivity.\nThe relatively high conductivity\nmeasured at 130 cm on probe 1 lies within a zone from\n80 to 130 cm where penetration\nwas slow. Directly\nbelow this layer, drilling rates were relatively high and\nthe conductivity\nvalues are correspondingly\nlower.\nThese correlations\nare used to interpolate\nvalues\nbetween discrete\nmeasures.\nIn figure 9-5, the solid\nline that passes through the heater-activated\nconductivity values represents\na layered model of conductivity in the regolith based partly on penetration\nrates\nand partly on cooldown\nestimates. At probe 2, some\nof the drilling operation\nwas not visually monitored\nso that correlations\nwith conductivity\ncannot\nbe\nmade during the unmonitored\nperiod, which includes\n\napproximately\nhalf the depth range where probe 2 is\nemplaced.\nOne interesting\nfeature\nof these conductivity\nresults is a rather\nlarge difference\nbetween\nthe\nconductivity\nprot_fles at probe 1 and probe 2. It is\npossible that layers, as defined by conductivity,\nhave\nsome dip relative to the surface. For example, the\nhigh conductivity\nlayer at 100 cm at probe 1 could\ncorrespond\nto the high conductivity\nlayer between\n170 and 230 cm at probe 2.\nThe contact\nconductance\n//2 arises from low\nconductivity\nmaterial\noutside the borestem.\n\nlying in a disturbed\nzone just\nWe estimate this zone to be 2.2\n\nmm thick.

At probe 1, the most\nrepresentative\nvalue of heat flow (2.8 X 10 -6\nW/cm 2) is thought\nto be that determined\nby the\nprobe data over the interval 130 to 233 cm. At probe\n2, the measurement\nis possibly disturbed, as will be\ndiscussed in the next section, and the most representative value (2.5 X 10 -6 W/cm 2) is that calculated\nusing data between 67 and 234 cm. The heat flow\ncalculated over the interval 91 to 138 cm is believed\nto be the\nments.\nAt the\n\nbest\n\nvalue\n\nApollo\n\nfrom\n\n17 probe\n\nthe Apollo\n\n15 measure-\n\n1 site, the heat\n\nflow is\n\nquite uniform\nover the entire depth\nrange. The\nvariation\nfalls well within the estimated\nerror of\nmeasurement.\nProbe 2 results show a uniform heat\nflow along the length of the probe, but heat flow\nbetween 67 and 131 cm is 70 percent greater. The\nlarge change in gradient is partly compensated\nfor by\nan increase in conductivity\nwith depth. The overall\nheat flow of 2.5 \xc3\x97 10 -6 W/cm 2 is in fair agreement\nwith the probe 1 value of 2.8 \xc3\x97 10 -6 W/cm 2 .\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOF HEAT\n\nThe Probe\n\nFLOW\n\nRESULTS\n\n2 Measurements\n\nThe change in heat flow at probe 2 by a factor\nslightly less than 2 over the depth range of 67 to 234\ncm is most reasonably explained by refraction of heat\nflow in the vicinity of a large buried boulder.\nA\nrelatively large number of rocks are strewn over the\nALSEP area. Lunar basalts have conductivities\nof\napproximately\n\n1.2 X 10 -2 to 1.8 \xc3\x97 10 -z W/cm-K at\n\n250 K (ref. 9-15). These values are 60 to 90 times the\nconductivity\nof the fine-grained\nregolith\nmaterial.\nThus, large blocks of solid rock in the subsurface can\nresult in significant shunting of heat flow.\nTo illustrate the shunting effect, the distortion\nof\nheat flow lines and isotherms around and through a\nsquare of material having 60 times the conductivity\nof a surrounding\ninfinite medium is shown in figure\n9-7. The model is two-dimensional\nand symmetric at\nthe left margin of the figure. One significant feature\nof the model is that very little effect is evidenced at\ndistances greater than one-half of the width of the\nrock. Thus, heat flow measurements\nwould have to be\nmade quite close to a rock (less than one-fourth\nof\nthe width) to detect a disturbance\nas large as that at\nprobe 2. However, probe 2 must be more than 5 cm\n\nFIGURE 9-7.-The effect of a square of material on vertical\nheat flow (shaded area) which has a conductivity 60 times\nthat of the surrounding material, shown by the distortion\nof isotherms and flow lines. These results are based on a\nf\'mite difference model computation.\n\nfrom a rock in order for the rock not to have a\ndetectable effect on the heater-activated\nconductivity\nexperiments.\nIf probe\n2 were located\nrelative\nto a large\nsubsurface boulder in a zone defined by the dashed\nrectangle in figure 9-7, a temperature\nprofile similar\nto that observed would result. Other features such as\n\n9-16\n\nAPOLLO\n17\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nSCIENCE\n\nthe slightly higher absolute temperatures\nmeasured by\nprobe 2 relative to probe 1 at all depths would also be\nexplained.\nIt should be noted that to explain the\nrather sudden change in gradient shown in figure 9-5,\na rather sharp-cornered\nrock is required.\nIf the vertical gradient were calculated using the\ntemperature\ndifference\nbetween\npoints a and b in\nfigure 9-7, the result would not be much different\nthan the vertical gradient far from the rock. This\nresult is obtained because the measurement\ninterval is\n\ncould\n\nlarge enough to span the zone of dilation\'of\nisotherms\nadjacent to the rock and the compensating\nzone of\ncompression\nof isotherms above it. If the same is true\n\nexcess heat flow decreases very rapidly with distance\nfrom the crater rim. At one crater radius from the rim\n\nfor probe 2, then the gradient determined\nby using\ntemperature\npoints at 67 and 234 cm should be close\nto the regional value. The fact that the average\ngradient at probe 2 is in close agreement with results\nof probe 1, which is thought\nto be free of such\ndisturbances,\nsupports this possibility. The results of\nprobe 1 should be regarded as the more representative\nvalue of heat flow at Taurus-Littrow.\n\nThe\n\non\n\nEffects\n\nDetailed assessment\nthe Taurus-Littrow\n\nof Topography\nof the effects\nmeasurement\n\nof topography\nhas not been\n\ncompleted\nto date. However,\nsome idea of the\nmagnitude\nof expected\ndisturbances\ncan be made\nbased on simplified\nterrain models. There are two\nimportant effects of topography\non the Moon. First,\nsurface relief causes a distortion\nof subsurface\nisotherms to conform to the surface temperature\ndistribution.\nConsequently,\na lowering of regional heat\nflow is generally found over convex-up features and\nan augmentation\nof heat flow is found over concaveup features. Second, lunar topography\nhas a significant effect on the surface temperature\ndistribution\nbecause the mean surface temperature\ndepends on a\nradiative balance of solar flux, radiation to space, and\nreradiation\nfrom the surrounding\nlunar surface. In\ngeneral, depressions such as craters will have slightly\nelevated mean temperatures\nbecause of the decreased\nview of the crater floor to space and reradiation from\nother parts of the crater (ref. 9-16). However, a\nnorth-facing\nslope such as that of the South Massif\nwould have a lower mean temperature\nbecause of the\nrelatively\nlarge angle of incidence\nof solar rays\nthroughout the lunar day.\nCraters of all sizes greater than 1 m in diameter\nthat are within a distance of one crater diameter\n\nhave\n\nREPORT\na measurable\n\neffect\n\non the\n\nheat\n\nflow\n\nmeasurement.\nFor example, the small craters near\nprobes 1 and 2 must be considered\nas well as the\n600-m crater Camelot approximately\n600 m to the\neast of the ALSEP site. Most of these craters have an\naspect ratio (diameter\nto 1. The dominant\n\nover depth) of approximately\n6\neffect of such craters is to\n\nincrease\nheat flow in areas just outside the rim\nbecause of the slightly higher mean surface temperature inside. Finite difference models show that the\n\nof a crater having a floor that is 3 K warmer than the\nsurrounding\nfiat surface,\nheat flow is increased\napproximately\n0.1 W/cm 2. Because the heat flow\nprobes are one or more radii away from the rims of\nall craters of interest,\nthe combined\neffect of all\ncraters would be small. An estimate of 0.3 W/cm 2 or\n10 percent\nwould be conservative.\nThe important\nresult is that a negative correction must be applied to\nthe observed\nvalues in order\nto compensate\nfor\nnearby craters.\nThe valley floor at Taurus-Littrow,\naside from\ncraters, is relatively smooth, and only the mountain\nranges north\nand south of the site would have\nsignificant\neffects. The effect of the massifs can be\nestimated using a method developed by Lachenbruch\n(ref. 9-17). The valley at Taurus-Littrow\nis modeled\nas a flat-floored\ntrough in an otherwise flat surface.\nThe walls of the trough have uniform slopes equal to\nthe average slopes of the north and south massifs\nmeasured\npublished\n\nfrom topographic\nmaps. Lachenbruch\nhas\ntables from which an estimate can be made\n\nof the effect on heat flow of such sloping surfaces\nintersecting\nhorizontal\nplanes. Based on this model,\nthe topographic\neffect of the massifs will cause a\n20-percent\nincrease in heat flow at the ALSEP site.\nThis estimate is maximal because it assumes that the\ntrend\n\nof the ridges extends\n\ninfinitely\n\nat the maximum\n\nelevation. The effect of the South Massif, in particular, is overestimated\nbecause the ridge does not\nextend very far to the southeast of the ALSEP site.\nLast, the valley at Taurus-Littrow\nwould have a\nslightly greater mean temperature\n(approximately\n1\nto 2 K) than the surrounding\nregions because the\nvalley behaves radiatively like a crater. The flow of\nheat from the warmer valley floor to the surface\noutside the bounding massifs would tend to decrease\nthe heat flow in the valley. This effect, which has not\nbeen\n\nquantitatively\n\nestimated\n\nat this time, may\n\nbe\n\nHEAT\nFLOW\nEXPERIMENT\nsignificant\nandwouldtend to\n\ncounterbalance\nthe\npositive effects already described.\nIn summary, the preliminary\nanalysis of the effect\nof topography\non the Apollo 17 measurement\nindicates that a negative correction estimated at 15 to 25\npercent should be applied to this observation.\nHowever, we believe that a more detailed and careful\nanalysis should be made before it can be assumed that\neffects of topography\nresult in a significant difference\nbetween the heat flow measurements\nat the TaurusLittrow\n\nand Rima Hadley sites.\n\nPossible\n\nCorrelation\n\nwith\n\nSurface\n\nRadioactivity\nAs previously described, a correction\neffects of topography\nof approximately\n\nfor the gross\n-20 percent\n\nmight be applicable to observed heat flow at TaurusLittrow, which would result in a value approximately\n25 percent less than that measured at Rima Hadley.\nBecause the difference\ndepends on the topographic\ncorrection,\nits significance\nmay be questionable.\nHowever, taken at face value, there is a correlation\nbetween the heat flow at the two sites and the surface\nradioactivity,\nas measured\nby the Apollo 15 gamma\nray spectrometer\n(ref. 9-18). Relatively high thorium\nabundances\nwere observed over the southeast corner\nof Mare Imbrium,\nand appreciably\nsmaller abundances were observed over the southeast\ncorner of\nMare Serenitatis.\nThe gamma ray spectrometer\nis\nsensitive only to the gamma-ray-emitting\nisotopes of\nuranium,\nthorium,\nor potassium\nin the most superficial layer. This tentative\ncorrelation\nwith the heat\nflow measurement,\nwhich\ndetects\nthe integrated\neffects\nmately\n\nof radiogenic\nheating to depths of approxi300 km, indicates that the surficial variations\n\nmay extend to depth.

The lunar regolith\nbecomes increasingly\ntransparent\nat wavelengths\nbeyond\nthe infrared.\nThus,\nobservations\nat longer\nwavelengths yield temperature\ninformation\nat increasing depths into the lunar regolith. For wavelengths\ngreater than\napproximately\n5 cm, the effective\nemitting layer is far enough below the lunar surface\nthat no variation in apparent brightness temperature\nover a lunation can be detected. However, an increase\nin brightness temperature\nwith increasing wavelength\nhas been observed. A plot of these measurements\nis\ngiven in reference 9-9. Between 5 and 20 cm, a nearly\nlinear increase of brightness temperature\nTb(_) with\nwavelength\n_. yields an average spectral gradient of\n_Tb/Ok = 0.8 K/cm.\nTo interpret\nthe spectral\ntemperature\ngradient in terms of a heat flow, estimates must be made of the electrical properties\nand\nof the thermal\nconductivity\nk of the effective\nemitting layer for the 5- to 20-cm waves. In particular, the characteristic\npenetration\ndepth I_e(),) of an\nelectromagnetic\nwave must be known as a function of\nwavelength.\nTikhonova and Troitskii (ref. 9-9) used simplified\nmodels of thermal and electrical property profiles to\nexplain the microwave\ndata over the 5- to 50-cm\nspectral range. The resultant inferred heat flow values\nof 2.9 X 10 -6\nto 4.0 X 10 -6\nW/cm are in\nremarkable\naccord with the in situ Apollo measurements, considering\nthe approximations\nand assumptions necessary\nto the remote\ndetermination.\nIn\nparticular, the electrical and thermal parameters were\nestimated\nfrom\nobservations\napplicable\nonly to\ndepths characterized\nby diurnal temperature\nvariations. The assumption\nthat near-surface\nparameter\nvalues apply to meter depths could lead to significant\nerrors in the interpretation\nof the observed spectral\ngradient. Electrical property determinations\nbased on\nremote radar measurements\nand on measurements\nmade on returned\nlunar samples must be used to\ninterpret the measured spectral gradient in terms of a\nthermal gradient. If the electrical and thermal properties of the regolith are considered\nto be homogeneous for depths greater than approximately\n70 cm and\nextend at least 5 to 10 m, the thermal temperature\ngradient can be expressed\ngradient by\n\nin terms\n\n_\'-\'_= (1 - R)z e\nwhere R\n\nis the\n\nappropriate\n\ncentimeter\n\nof the spectral\n\n(9-11)\nwave reflec-\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n9-18\n\ntion coefficient for the lunar-surface/space interface.\nFor the very low electrical conductivities found in\nthe lunar regolith, the electromagnetic penetration\ndepth !?,(A) may be written for the centimeter wave\nspectral region as\nIle(A)\n\n= A/(~IT&\n\ntan A )\n\n(9-12)\n\nwhere E is the dielectric constant and tan A is the loss\ntangent at centimeter wavelengths.\nThe average temperature gradient of 0.01 7 K/m\nmeasured in situ at the Apollo 15 and 17 sites would\nproduce the observed spectral gradient if d c t a n A\n0.003, assuming R = 0.05. The feasibility of such a\nvalue for fi tan A is supported by direct surface\nobservations in the 0.4- to 3-cm wavelength range\n(ref. 9-19). Direct measurements of returned Apollo\nsamples over a wide range of frequencies indicate a\ndielectric constant for the regolith material in the\nrange 2.2 to 3.2 that is nearly frequency independent.\n\nHowever, loss tangent measurements yield values in\nthe range 0.0004 to 0.01 and are frequency dependent (refs. 9-20 and 9-22). Additional electrical\nproperty measurements and refined analysis of the\nexisting data on regolith samples must be made\nbefore the thermal gradient measured in situ can be\nsupported on a moonwide basis by the spectral\ngradient observations.\n\nT h e Representativeness of t h e\nTwo Heat F l o w Measurements\nThe regional geological settings of Rima Hadley\nand Taurus-Littrow are quite similar. Both are located\non lava-flooded embayments at the edge of mascon\nbasins. If the heat flow is influenced by structural or\ncompositional anomalies unique to this type of\nregion, the anomalies would affect both measurements. To that extent, they would not be representative of global flux from the Moon. However, the\n\nFIG. 9-8.-Photograph of probe 2 borestcm protruding from the lunar surface.

The thermocouple is in the black portion of cable approximately 10 cm from the top of the stem (AS17-134-20492).\n\nHEAT\nFLOW\nEXPERIMENT\npossible compatibility\nof the results with the microwave emission spectral gradient between 5- and 20-cm\nwavelengths lends support to the possibility that local\nanomalies at the two sites are not large.\nDespite\nthe reservations\nin the previous\nparagraphs, the existing data concerning\nheat flow from\nthe lunar interior indicate that a significant area of\nthe Moon is characterized\nby a flux of between 2.5\nand 3.0/_W/cm 2 . Numerous thermal history calculations have shown that the contribution\nof initial heat\n(e.g.,\n\nthat\n\ngained\n\nduring\n\naccretion)\n\nto the\n\ngeochemical\ndata are convincing that most of these\nisotopes are concentrated\nin the outer layers of the\nMoon. In addition,\nthe abundances\nindicated by the\nheat flow values would require the heat sources to be\nlocated near the surface to prevent melting in the\nouter several hundred kilometers.\nThe\n\nradiogenic\n\nheat\n\nproduction\n\nrock can be expressed\nof uranium,\nbecause\n\nother important\nlong-lived,\n(4\xc2\xb0K and 232Th) to uranium\n\nper cubic\nin terms\nthe ratios\n\nshown in figure 9-8. These thermocouples,\nin radiative balance with the lunar surface, with the solar\nflux, and with space, thus provide a measurement\nof\nthe surface brightness\ntemperature\nthroughout\nthe\nlunation.\nThe flux balance equation\ngoverning the\nthermocouple\ntemperature\nis\n2_a dlE oT _ = 2_a dIF\n_ a . oT 4\nc\nc c\nc\nc-m m c_r m\n\npresent\n\nsurface flux is relatively small (refs. 9-11 and 9-23)\neven if the Moon were molten throughout\ninitially.\nSome scientists\nhave suggested that, at the present\ntime, the Moon is thermally at steady state (e.g., ref.\n9-24). In either case, it follows that a predominant\npart of the surface flux (2.0 to 3.0/aW/cm 2) must\nresult from radioactive\nisotopes in the Moon. The\n\nmeter of\nabundance\n\n9-19\n\ncentiof the\nof the\n\nheat-generating\nisotopes\nare well established and\n\nquite uniform in the lunar samples. The heat production per unit volume at the present time in W/cm 3 is\napproximately\n0.71 times the uranium abundance\nin\nparts per million (e.g., refs. 9-23 and 9-25). If most\nof the uranium is concentrated\nwithin 300 km of the\nsurface so that it contributed\nto the present flux,\nthen the total lunar uranium abundance\nrequired to\ncontribute\n2.0 to 3.0 pW/cm 2 to the heat flow is\napproximately\n0.05 to 0.075 ppm. These abundances\nare much greater than chondrites\nand significantly\nhigher than estimates\nof the Earth abundance\nof\napproximately\n0.03 ppm (ref. 9-4).\n\nSURFACE\nTEMPERATURES\nDEDUCED\nFROM THERMOCOUPLE\nM EASU R EM ENTS\nAt each of the two heat flow holes, one of the\nthermocouples\nis embedded\nin a section of the cable\nthat is approximately\n15 cm from the top of the\nborestem\nand suspended above the lunar surface as\n\n+ 2acdiSacs _\n+ 2_a\n\nc\n\n_ p2\n\ndlSAa F\ncos X sin\ncs c-m\n(9-13)\n\nwhere Tc\nTm\nac\ndl\nec\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nthermocouple\ntemperature\nlunar surface brightness temperature\nradius of thermocouple\ncable\nelemental length of cable\ninfrared emissivity of cable\n\nacir = infrared\n\nabsorptivity\n\nof cable\n\nacs = absorptivity\nof cable to solar flux\nFc. m = view factor of cable to the lunar surface,\nincluding the surrounding mountains\np = cosine of the angle between the Sun line\nand the cable axis, a function\nof cable\norientation\nand lunar phase angle\nX = selenographic\n_b= lunar phase\nsunrise\n\nlatitude\nat Taurus-Littrow\nangle measured\nfrom local\n\nem = infrared\nemissivity\nof the lunar\n(2 1.0)\nS = the mean solar constant of 0.1352\nA = lunar albedo of 0.08\no = the Stefan-Boltzmann\nconstant\nThe first term on the right side of equation\n\nsurface\nW/cm 2\n\n(9-13)\n\nrepresents flux into the cable element from the lunar\nsurface; the second term represents direct flux from\nthe Sun; the third term represents\nsolar energy\nreflected diffusely from the lunar surface and impinging on the cable.\nThe radiative\n\nproperties\n\nof the cable ec, Otcir, and\n\nCtcs were determined\nby laboratory\nmeasurement\nbefore the Apollo 17 mission.

The density profile for the Apollo 17\nsite was determined\nfrom preliminary examination\nof\nreturned\ncore tube samples (D. Carrier,\npersonal\ncommunication,\n1973). In both the Apollo 15 and 17\nmodels, the heat capacity as a function of temperature was taken from Robie et al. data (ref. 9-29) on\nreturned Apollo 11 samples. In both models, a low\nconductivity\nlayer approximately\n2 cm thick is\nrequired to fit the steep drop in surface temperature\nimmediately after sunset. The Apollo 15 model then\nrequires\na steep, but not discontinuous,\nrise in\nconductivity\nwith depth down to 5 cm to produce\nthe increased\nflattening\nof the cooldown\ncurve\nthrough\nthe lunar night. The Apollo\n17 model,\nhowever, requires a very sharp rise in conductivity\nat\na depth of approximately\n2 cm to produce the abrupt\nflattening of the cooldown curve at a phase angle of\napproximately\n190 \xc2\xb0 . The subsequent\nincrease\nin\nconductivity\nwith depth is slight enough so that the\nApollo 17 model may be considered\nessentially\na\ntwo-layer model. The large jump in conductivity\nat 2\ncm is also supported\nby the preliminary\ndensity\nprofile, which indicates a fairly high density quite\nclose to the surface. The Apollo 15 density profile,\nhowever, supports\nthe possibility that a substantial\nconductivity\ngradient exists over the upper 30 cm of\nthe regolith.\nThe most critical surface temperature\ndata\nrequired\nfor the purpose\nof determining\nthermal\nregolith profiles are those obtained during the 10 to 30\nhr immediately after sunset. Surface temperature\ndata\nduring this period have been the most difficult to\nobtain from remote infrared brightness\nscans. The\nlevel and steepness of the cooldown data immediately\nafter sunset are controlled\nalmost entirely by the\nthermal properties\nof the upper 2 cm. If the very\nearly nighttime data are not sufficiently\naccurate to\nconstrain the thermal properties of the upper 2 to 3\ncm of the dust layer within +-30 percent,\nthen\nsubsequent\nattempts\nto determine\ndeeper conductivity values unambiguously\nfrom the flattened\npart\nof the cooldown\ncurve will not be possible. For\nexample, the broken-line\ncurve of figure 9-10 fits the\nnighttime data after 192 \xc2\xb0 phase angle well within the\nerror bands of the data. However, discrepancies\nin the\nearly postsunset\nfit produced\nby different conductivities within the upper 2 cm lead to discrepancies as\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nmuch as a factor\nfor depths\n\nof 2 in conductivity\n\ndeterminations\n\nbelow 2 cm (curve 17a, fig. 9-10 inset).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDuring the Apollo missions, two heat flow measurements\nwere successfully\nmade on the lunar\nsurface. Both measurement\nsites are in similar regional settings in the northeast quadrant of the Moon.\nThe Taurus-Littrow\nand Rima Hadley sites are located in embayments\nin the mountainous\nrims of the\nImbrium\nand Serenitatis\nmascon basins that have\nbeen flooded by mare-type basalts.\nSurface brightness\ntemperatures\nwere calculated\nfrom the temperature\nof thermocouples\nsuspended\nseveral centimeters\nabove the lunar surface. The mean\nsurface temperature\nat\nlunation\ncycle is 207\n\nRima Hadley throughout\na\nK. The mean temperature\n\nincreases with depth very rapidly in the upper few\ncentimeters\nand is approximately\n252 K at a depth of\n90 cm. The main reason for this increase of 45 K is\nthe predominant\nrole of radiative heat transfer in the\nloosely packed upper layer. During the lunar night,\nthe surface temperature\nat Rima Hadley falls to 93 K.\nFrom the cooldown\nhistory after sunset, we have\ndeduced\nthat the upper 2 cm of the regolith\nis\ncharacterized\nby a conductivity\nof 1.5 X 10 -s\nW/cm-K. Below this depth, the conductivity\nincreases\nrapidly and probably in a continuous\nmanner until it\nreaches values of approximately\n1.5 X 10 -4 W/cm-K\nat depths where the probes are emplaced.\nAt Taurus-Littrow,\nthe mean surface temperature\nis 216 K and, as in the case of Rima Hadley, increases\na few tens of degrees in the upper 2 cm so that, at a\ndepth of 67 cm, a mean temperature\nof 254 K is\nmeasured.\nThe minimum\ntemperature\njust before\nlunar dawn is 103 K, 10 K higher than that at Rima\nHadley. This higher temperature\nis primarily attributable to the existence of a relatively high conductivity\nlayer at a depth 2 cm below the surface. From the\npoint of view of thermal properties,\nthe regolith at\nTaurus-Littrow\ncan be described\nas two layers: an\nupper 2-cm, loosely packed layer of very low conductivity (1.5 X 10 -s W/cm-K) in which heat transfer by\nradiation\npredominates\nand a lower layer with much\nhigher conductivity\n(> 1.2 X 10 -4 W/cm-K)and\nhigher density (1.8 to 2.0 g/cm3).\nSubsurface temperature\nand conductivity\nmeasurements at depths below 90 cm, where the large diurnal\nvariations are negligibly small, indicate a steady-state\n\nHEAT\nheat\n\nflow\n\n10 -6\n\nthrough\n\nthe surface\n\nW/cm 2 and\n\nW/cm 2\nThese\n\nwith\n\nan\n\nfluxes\n\ngradients\nand\n10 -4\n\nestimated\ndeduced\n\nbetween\n\nconductivity\n\naverage\n\nW/cm-K.\n\nincreases\n\nwith\n\ndepth\n\nin the\n\nlayering,\n\nwith\n\nhigh\n\nlower\n\n9-VI).\n\n10 -4\n\nW/cm-K\n\nin\n\n17\n\nconductivity.\n\nlarge\n\nsite.\n\nin some\nAt\n\ndecrease\n\nattributable\n\nin\nto\n\na large\n\nextent\n\nby\n\nindicate\n\nlocal\n\nthat\n\nbe applicable\nthe\n\nis required.\nheat\nflow\n\napproximately\nEarth\n\n(6.3\n\n10 -6\n\nrepresentative\nwhole,\n\nof\n\nthen\n\nrequires\ninterior\n\na heat\n\nassumes\n\nsteady\n\nstate\n\n238U, and\n\n232Th\n\nEarth\n\nfrom\n\nrefined\nsites\n\nflow\n\ntwo\n\nof\n\nis\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nvalues\n\nare\n\nthe\n\nMoon\n\nas\n\nthat\n\nof the\n\nEarth\n\nto\n\ninterior\n\nMoon,\n\nrelative\n\nshow\n\nthat\n\nto\n\nthe\n\na\n\nso that,\n\nin the Moon,\nheating.\n\nconcentrated\n\nin\n\nto avoid\n\nouter\n\nthe\n\nin situ\n\nin determining\nlunar\n\nheat\n\nflow\n\nsamples\n\nrelative\nof\n\n200\n\nat shallow\n\nthe\n\nto\nEarth\n\ncontributor\nmust\n\nbe\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nkm\n\ndepth.\n\nmeasurements\n\ntemperatures\n\nthermal\n\na\n\nin the\n\nisotopes\n\nto\n\nEarth-based\n\nin\n\nLunar\nthat\n\nthese\n100\n\n23SU,\n\nimply\n\nuranium\n\npotassium\n\nmelting\n\nof\n\n4\xc2\xb0K,\n\nof heat\n\nis the main\n\nAt present,\nthe\n\nnear\n\nis nearly\n\nresults\n\nEarth.\n\nof\n\nuranium\n\nbrightness\n\nimportant\n\nof\n\nin the\n\nextensive\n\nregolith\n\nbe\n\nflow\n\nto one-fourth\n\nReinterpretation\n\non\n\nof\nsource\n\nheat\n\nthat\n\nis one-third\n\nmicrowave\n\nprincipal\n\nabundance\n\nare\n\nloss\n\nproduction.\n\nenrichment\n\nuranium\n\nto internal\n\nheat\n\nthe\n\nthreefold\n\nMoon\n\nheat\n\nradioisotopes\n\nthe\n\nare\n\nbodies\n\nsurface\n\nlong-lived\n\nand\n\ntwofold\n\ndata\n\nheat\n\nplanetary\n\ntotal\n\nto the present\nthe\n\nMoon\n\ntwo\n\nof one-half\n\nboth\n\nso that\n\nBecause\n\nthe\n\nflow\n\nflow\n\nthe\n\nIf these\n\nand electrical\n\nusing\n\nthe\n\nproperties\n\nof\nnew\nwill\n\nthe representativeness\nmeasurements.\n\nof heat\n\nbe valuable\nflow\n\nover\n\ndisin\nthe\n\nsurface.\n\nIndustries, Inc.; and the Rosemount\nThe lunar surface drill was developed\n\nEngineering Company.\nby the Martin Marietta\n\nCorporation.\nThe authors\nthank Kenneth\nPeters\nof the\nLamont-Doherty\nGeological Observatory\nfor help in much of\nthe numerical analysis.

Watkins, b\nand Pradeep Talwani a\n\nThe successful installation\nof a geophysical station\nat the Taurus-Littrow\nlanding site of the Apollo 17\nmission marked the culmination\nof an exciting period\nof manned lunar exploration\nand vastly improved\ncurrent knowledge of the lunar interior.\nBefore the\nApollo 17 mission, there was a gap in our knowledge\nconcerning\nthe upper\n10 km of the lunar crust\nbecause of the large hiatus in pertinent\ntraveltime\ndata between the coverage provided by the previous\nactive seismic experiments\non Apollo 14 and 16 and\nthat of the earlier lunar module\n(LM) and SIVB\nimpacts. In particular,\nit was not possible to resolve\nwhether\nthe seismic velocity increased smoothly\nor\nstepwise in the upper 5 km of the Moon.\nThe purpose\nof the Apollo\n17 lunar seismic\nprofiling\nexperiment\n(LSPE)\nwas to record the\nvibrations of the lunar surface as\nsive charges, by the thrust of the\nand by the crash of the LM ascent\nthese seismic data were planned\ninternal characteristics\nof several kilometers.\n\nExperiment\n\ninduced by exploLM ascent engine,\nstage. Analyses of\nto determine\nthe\n\nof the lunar crust to a depth\nThe traveltimes\nof seismic\n\nwaves are inverted to determine the seismic velocity\nstructure with depth and to provide the direct means\nof probing the lunar interior. A secondary objective\nof the LSPE was to monitor lunar seismic activity\nduring periodic listening intervals.\n\nsurface\n\n8.7 km\n\nsouthwest\n\nof the\n\nlanding\n\nsite. The\n\ncharacteristic\nreverberation\nfrom this impact spread\noutward and was first detected\nat the Apollo 17\nstation approximately\n6 sec after impact. The seismic\nsignals received from this impact provided a valuable\ntraveltime\ndatum for determining\nthe variation of\nseismic velocity\nwith depth in approximately\nthe\nupper 5 km of the Moon.\nThe most significant\ndiscovery resulting from the\nanalysis of the data recorded by the LSPE is that the\nseismic velocity\nincreases\nin a marked\nstepwise\nmanner beneath the Apollo 17 landing site (fig. 10-1).\nA surface layer with a seismic velocity of 250 m/sec\nand a thickness\nof 248 m overlies a layer with a\nseismic velocity of 1200 m/sec and a thickness of 927\nm, with a sharp increase\nto approximately\n4000\nm/sec at the base of the lower layer. The seismic\nvelocities for the upper layers are compatible\nwith\nthose for basaltic\nlava flows, indicating\na total\nthickness of approximately\n1200 m for the infilling\nmare basalts at Taurus-Littrow.\nMajor episodes of\ndeposition or evolution\nare implied by the observed\nabrupt changes in seismic velocity.\n\nINSTRUMENT\nDESCRIPTION\nPERFORMANCE\n\nStrong seismic signals were recorded\nfrom the\ndetonation\nof eight explosive charges that were armed\nand placed on the lunar surface by the crewmen at\nvarious points along the traverses. Recording of these\nseismic signals generated traveltime data to a distance\nof 2.7 km.\n\nAND\n\nThe LSPE consists of a geophone\narray, eight\nexplosive packages, and electronics within the Apollo\nlunar surface experiments\npackage (ALSEP) central\nstation.\nFour identical\ngeophones\nare used in a\ntriangular array; the geophones are miniature seismometers of the moving coil-magnet type.

In addition,\nmonitoring of the seismic signals generated by the LM\nascent engine at lunar lift-off provided useful data.\n\n_. _ - - d\xe2\x80\x9d-*&\n1: -* - .d\nA\n-\n\nFIGURE 10-8.-Photogaph of EP-8 on the lunar surface 296\nm west of the LM (AS17-145-22184).\n\nLunar Module Ascent\nThe LSPE was commanded on at 22:24:00 G.m.t.\non December 14, 1972, to record the impulse\nproduced by the thrust of the LM ascent engine. The\neffective zero time for the seismic impulse from the\nLM ascentengine ignition was determined from\nNASA postflight analyses, which gave engine buildup\npressure data at 5-msec intervals for the LM lift-off.\nThe assigned ignition time of 22:54:38.424 G.m.t.\n\ncorresponds to the time when the LM ascent engine\nachieved 20 percent of its maximum propulsion\npressure. Clear seismic signals were recorded by the\nLSPE geophone array at distances of 148, 244, 190,\nand 187 m (fig. 10-9).

For a surface impact, the theory predicts\n(ref. 10-1) that the signal rise time (the time from\nsignal onset to its maximum value) is given by R 2/_\nwhere R is the range.\nThe Apollo 17 LM impact seismic signal rise time\nof 56 sec leads to a diffusivity\nof 1.35 km2/sec,\nwhich is significantly\nlarger than the value of 0.033\nkm2/sec inferred at the Apollo 16 site (ref. 10-2)\nfrom analysis of the seismic signals generated by the\nLRV at distances\nof approximately\n4 kin. The\nimplication is that the Apollo 17 landing area is more\nhomogeneous,\nfor the dimensions\nof the seismic\nwaves considered\n(approximately\n25 m), than either\nthe Apollo 15 or 16 landing areas. Such a difference\nin near-surface\nproperties\nof these landing sites may\nbe attributable\nto differing ages of the different areas\nand to the effects of differing amounts of comminution and gardening by meteoroid impacts.\n\nExplosive Packages\nAll eight of the explosive packages placed on the\nlunar surface were successfully\ndetonated.\nThe seismic data recorded for EP-5, which was detonated at\nstation 9, are shown in figure 10-12.

The measurements\non\nunconsolidated\nsands and rock powders also have\ndemonstrated\nthat no unique relation exists between\nseismic velocity and porosity in granular material. An\nexamination\nof these experimental\ndata led to the\ninference that compositional\nor textural changes must\nbe important\nin the upper 5 km of the Moon (ref.\n10-5).\nThe LSPE results have shown that, at least beneath\nthe Taurus-Littrow\nsite, the seismic velocity increases\nin a stepwise manner in the upper several kilometers.\nIt is of interest\nto examine\nthe in situ velocity\ninformation\nwith reference\nto the surface geological\ninvestigations\nat the Apollo 17 site, the laboratory\nvelocity measurements\nfrom returned lunar samples,\nand the seismic velocity measurements\non terrestrial\nlunar analogs.\nPremission\n\nanalyses\n\nindicated\n\nthat\n\nmuch\n\nof the\n\nApollo 17 landing site area is covered by a dark\nmantling material, possibly volcanic ash (ref. 10-1 I).\nCrew observations\nof the lunar surface revealed that\nthere was no readily discernible boundary\nbetween\nthe overlying\nthin regolith\nand the dark mantling\nmaterial. The thickness of the dark mantling material\nwas estimated to be between 5 and 10 m (ref. 10-3).\nAs pointed out earlier, whether\nthe dark mantling\nmaterial/subfloor\ninterface represents a sharp seismic\ndiscontinuity\nor is gradational\ncannot be determined\nbecause the shortest explosive-charge-to-receiver\ndistance was approximately\n100 m.\nThe dominant rock type observed underlying\nthe\ndark mantling material is a medium-grained\nvesicular\nbasalt believed to be primarily mare-type basalt. Crew\nobservations\nof the crater walls revealed textural\nvariations that suggest the involvement\nof individual\nflow units. Seismic observations\nhave indicated 248 m\nof 250-m/sec\nmaterial.\n\nmaterial\n\noverlying\n\n927 m of 1200-m/sec\n\nThe abrupt change in seismic velocity from 250 to\n1200 m/sec and, by inference,\nin other physical\nproperties\nsuggests a major change in the nature of\nthe evolution or deposition of the Apollo 17 subfloor\nbasalts. However, a similar range of seismic velocities\nhas been observed with refraction surveys on terrestrial lava flows. Some insight can be gained by\nconsidering specific lava flows that have been exam-\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\n10-11\n\nined in some detail as possible lunar analogs: the\nSouthern Coulee, the SP flow, and the Kana-a flow\n(refs. 10-12 and 10-13).\nThe Southern Coulee is a recent lava flow near the\nMono Craters in eastern California. Seismic velocities\nrange from 160 m/sec at the surface to 2000 m/sec at\ndepth.\nThe higher velocities\nare found\nin more\ncompetent, denser lava that undedies higher porosity,\nlower density surface material.\nThe SP flow is a\nblocky basalt flow located in the northern part of the\nSan Francisco volcanic field near Flagstaff, Arizona.\nVesicularity ranges from 5 to 50 percent, and in situ\nseismic velocities range from 700 to 1100 m/sec. The\nKana-a flow, also located near Flagstaff, is an olivine\nbasalt flow intermingled\nwith ash; seismic velocities\nrange from 700 to 1200 m/sec.\nObserved\nvelocities\non terrestrial\nlava flows\nbracket the velocities measured at the Apollo 17 site\nand therefore support\nthe presence of lava flows in\nthe Taurus-Littrow\nvalley. Whether\nthe 250-m/sec\nvelocity is representative\nof a separate flow or is\nmerely the manifestation\nof shattered\nnear-surface\nbasalts mixed with pyroclastic\nmaterials cannot be\nresolved from the seismic data. Nevertheless, a surface\nlayer of fractured,\nloose, blocky material merging\ninto more welded flows is a common occurrence\non\nEarth. Photographs\nof the walls of Hadley RiUe (ref.\n10-14) also attest\nto the blocky\nnature\nof the\nnear-surface mare basalts. Because of the similarity in\nstructure and the analogous seismic velocities on the\nEarth and the Moon, the sum of the 248 m of\n250-m/sec material and 927 m of 1200-m/sec\nmaterial, 1175 m, is designated\nas representing\nthe full\nthickness of the subfloor basalts at the Apollo 17 site.\nThe material underlying\nthe basalts with a seismic\nvelocity of _ km/sec is difficult to classify by rock\ntype. Based on the geological evidence, it seems likely\nthat the highland massif material\nthat rings the\nnarrow, grabenlike\nvalley at the Apollo\n17 site\nunderlies the basalt flow or flows. Several rock types\nwere recognized in the North and South Massifs, but\nthe dominant rock type is apparently a coherent\nbreccia believed to be similar to the breccias sampled\nat the Apennine Front (Apollo 15) and at Descartes\n(Apollo 16).\nLaboratory velocity\nmeasurements have been reported for two Apollo 15 breccias, 15418 and 15015\n(ref. 10-15). Sample 15418 is described as a dark-gray\nbreccia of chemical composition\nsimilar to that of\nanorthite-rich gabbro. Sample 15015 is a more friable\n\n10-12\n\nAPOLLO\n\nbreccia\n\nof unknown\n\nkm/sec\nin\n\nthe\n\ncomposition.\n\nis close\n\nto the\n\nlaboratory\n\nfigure\n\nfor\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nThe in situ value\n\nseismic\n\nsample\n\nvelocities\n15015\n\nof\n\nmeasured\n\nand\n\nshown\n\nin\n\n10-16.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBefore the Apollo 17 mission, the question of how\nthe P-wave velocity increased from 100 to 300 m/sec\nnear the surface (refs. 10-16 to 10-19) to -_6 km/sec\nat\n\na depth\n\nplained.\ngap\n\n15\n\nthe\n\n(Apollo\n\nseismic\nseismic\n\nseismic\n\nvelocity\n\nvelocity\nlayer,\n\nof\nthe\n\nm]sec.\n\nthose\n\nincreases\n2.5\n\nof 250\n\n1200\n\na sharp\n\nof 250\n\nand\n\nfor basaltic\nof\n\nat\n\nstepwise\nwith\n\na\n\nwith\n\na\n\n1200-m/sec\n\nsharply\n1200\n\nto 4000\n\nm/sec\n\nlava flows,\n1200\n\nagree\n\nindicating\nm for\n\nthe\n\nWhen\n\nTaurus-Littrow.\n\nthe\n\nApollo\n17 results are combined\nwith\ndata for direct\nand surface-reflected\n\nearlier traveltime\nseismic\narrivals\n\nfrom\n\n10-2),\n\npossible\n\nLM\nto\n\nand\n\nSIVB\n\nconstruct\n\nlunar\n\ncrust\n\nbelieved\n\nbasin.\n\nSuch\n\nwork\n\nimpacts\n\n(ref.\n\na velocity\nto\n\nis now\n\nbe\n\nmodel\n\nit will\n\nfor the\n\nrepresentative\n\nfor\n\nbe\n\nupper\na mare\n\nunderway.\n\n10-1.

The oldest of these stations, Apollo 12, has\nnow operated\nfor more than 3 yr, and the entire\nnetwork has been in operation\nfor I yr as of April\n1973. Four seismometers\nare included\nat each station: three low-frequency\ncomponents\nforming a\ntriaxial set (one sensitive to vertical motion and two\nsensitive to horizontal\nmotion)\nwith sensitivity\nto\nground motion\nsharply peaked at 0.45 Hz, and a\nfourth seismometer\nsensitive to vertical motion with\npeak sensitivity at 8 Hz (high-frequency\nThese instruments\ncan detect vibrations\n\ncomponent).\nof the lunar\n\nsurface as small as 0.05 nm at maximum sensitivity.\nOf the 16 separate seismometers,\nall but two are\npresently\noperating\nproperly.\nThe high-frequency\ncomponent\nat the Apollo 12 station has failed to\noperate\nsince initial\nactivation,\nand one of the\nlow-frequency\nseismometers\nat the Apollo 14 station\n(vertical component)\nbecame unstable after 1 yr of\noperation.\nMoonquakes\nhave been detected\nby the lowfrequency\nseismometers\nof each station at average\nrates of between 600 and 3000 per year, depending on\nthe station;\nall the moonquakes\nare quite small by\nterrestrial\nstandards\n(Richter\nmagnitude\n2 or less).\nThousands\nof even smaller moonquakes\nare detected\n\nby\n\nthe high-frequency\n\nseismometers.\n\nMeteoroid\n\npacts are detected by the low-frequency\nat average rates of between\n70 and\n\nim-\n\nseismometers\n150 per year.\n\nAlthough less numerous than moonquakes,\nmeteoroid\nimpacts generate the largest signals detected.\nSeveral criteria have been useful in distinguishing\nmoonquake\nsignals from meteoroid\nimpact signals.\nThe most useful are the character of shear waves and\nthe time interval from the beginning of a signal to its\nmaximum\namplitude\n(the signal rise time). Moonquake signals have impulsive shear wave arrivals and\nshort rise times relative to those of impact signals. In\naddition,\nmany of the moonquake\nsignals can be\ngrouped into sets of matching events; signals of each\nset have nearly identical\nwaveforms.\nSignals from\nmeteoroid\nimpacts\ncannot\nbe matched\nwith one\nanother.\nAnalysis of the seismic signals from the manmade\nimpacts and from natural sources has led to a model\nfor the Moon that is quite different from that of the\nEarth. Refinements\nin the present lunar model can be\nexpected as data accumulate\nfrom natural events.

Scattering in this zone\naccounts for the prolongation\nof lunar seismic signals\nand for the complexity\nof the recorded\nground\nmotion relative to typical terrestrial signals (refs. 11-I\nand 11-2).

Space Flight Network Apollo tracking data. Locations based on these\nsurface and may differ by several kilometers from coordinates\nreferenced to surface\n\ndata reduced\n\nthe accuracy\n\nof the estimate.\n\nThe listed coordinates\n\nfor this impact\n\nare estimated\n\nPASSIVE\n\nSEISMIC\n\nvelocity of compressional\nwaves in the lower half of\nthe crust is between\n6.3 and 7.0 km/sec, a velocity\nrange appropriate\nfor the aluminous\nbasalts and\ngabbroic anorthosites\nthat predominate\nin the lunar\nhighlands sampled thus far. Thus, the most plausible\nhypothesis is that a widespread crust, formed early in\nthe history of the Moon, outcrops\nin the present\nlunar highlands. The thickness of the crust is likely to\nvary greatly. There is some evidence for a discontinuity within the crust at a depth of 25 km that may\ndefine\nthe base of the mare basalts in Oceanus\nProcellarum (ref. 11-3).\nBelow the crust, a relatively\n\nhomogeneous\n\nzone\n\nextending\nto a depth of approximately\n1000 km is\nsuggested by the nearly constant velocity of seismic\nwaves. The average velocity of compressional\nwaves in\nthe homogeneous\nzone is approximately\n8 km/sec. A\nslight decrease in velocity with depth probably occurs\nin the lower half of this zone. Very low attenuation\nof both compressional\nand shear waves in this zone\nprecludes\nthe presence\nof any appreciable\nmelting.\nPoisson\'s ratio is approximately\n0.25 at the top of the\nmantle.\nA striking contrast has been found between signals\nthat originate on the near side of the Moon and those\nfrom far-side sources. Direct shear waves, normally\nprominent\nin signals from near-side moonquakes\nand\nweakly defined in near-side meteoroid impact signals,\ncannot be found in the seismograms\nrecorded\nat\nseveral of the seismic stations from far-side events.\nFor example,\nas shown in figure 11-1, shear waves\nfrom a large meteoroid\nthat struck the far side near\nthe crater Moscoviense arrive at the Apollo 15 station\nat the expected\ntime, but they are missing at the\nApollo 14 and 16 stations when expected. Much later\nphases arrive at these stations at times predicted\nfor\nsurface-reflected\nshear waves (SS) that travel through\nthe upper mantle of the Moon. Similarly, shear waves\nfrom far-side moonquakes\nthat can be identified\nat\nthe Apollo\n15 and 16 stations are missing at the\nApollo 14 station (fig. 11-2).\nAlthough available data are not sufficient to derive\na detailed\nseismic\nvelocity\nmodel\nfor the deep\ninterior,\nthese observations\ncan be explained\nby\nintroducing\na "core" with a radius between 600 and\n800 km in which shear waves either do not propagate\nor are highly\nattenuated\n(dissipation\nfactor Q of\napproximately\n100 or less) (ref. 11-7). The compressional wave velocity within this zone may be slightly\nlower\nthan that\nin the mantle.\nThe maximum\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\n11-3\n\nallowable velocity decrease for compressional\nwaves is\napproximately\n0.3 km/sec.\nThe term "core"\nas\napplied in this discussion\nis not meant to imply a\nmajor compositional\nor structural discontinuity\nas it\ndoes for the Earth. In the lunar case, it is simply a\ncentral zone in which the characteristics\nof seismic\nwave transmission differ from those in the surrounding material.\nHowever,\nthe presence\nof a small\n"inner" core in the terrestrial sense is not precluded\nby present data.\nSeismic wave attenuation\nis strongly temperature\ndependent,\nshowing rapid increase with increasing\ntemperatures\nand increasing sharply with the onset of\nmelting (ref. 11-8). Thus, temperatures\napproaching\nthe solidus (melting point) in the lunar interior may\naccount\nfor the lack of shear wave transmission\nindicated by the seismic data. Assuming an interior of\nmafic silicate composition,\nthis state would require\ntemperatures\nof between 1700 and 1900 K at a depth\nof approximately\n1000 km. This model is in substantial agreement\nwith several thermal models recently proposed\nby Toksoz et al. (ref. 11-9). Partial\nmelting of silicate material is considered\nto be a\npossible cause of the low Q, low-velocity zone of the\nupper mantle of the Earth (refs. 11-8 and 11-10). A\ncompletely\nmolten core of the size indicated,\nhowever, is not likely because a decrease of the compressional wave velocity\nexceeding\nthe value of 0.3\nkm/sec obtained by the preliminary analysis would be\nexpected.\nOther\npossibilities,\nsuch\nas increased\nvolatiles in the deep interior of the Moon, cannot be\neliminated at present.\nThe possibility\nof a high-density,\nmolten metallic\ncore similar to that of the Earth is eliminated by both\nmoment-of-inertia\nand seismic-wave-velocity\nconsiderations. The radius of approximately\n700 km is too\nlarge for such a core.\nBy analogy with the Earth, the lithosphere-the\nrelatively rigid outer shell of the Moon-can\nbe\nconsidered to be approximately\n1000 km thick. The\ncore of the Moon is equivalent to the asthenosphere\n(low-velocity zone) of the Earth.\n\nMOONQUAKES\n\nAND\n\nThermal\n\nLUNAR\n\nTECTONISM\n\nMoonquakes\n\nThousands\nof small seismic signals have been\ndetected by the high-frequency\nseismometers\nat the\nApollo 14, 15, and 16 stations.

Einstein\'s theory describes\ngravitation\nas propagating\nwith the speed of light.\nGravitational\nwaves carry energy, momentum,\nand\ninformation\nconcerning\nchanges in the configuration\nof their source. In these respects,\nsuch waves are\nsimilar to electromagnetic\nwaves; however, electro-\n\nvibrations\n\nmagnetic\nwaves only interact\nwith electric charges\nand electric currents.\nGravitational\nwaves are predicted to interact with all forms of energy.\nThe visible light, radio, and X-ray emissions,\ntogether with the cosmic rays, are the sources of all\nour present information\nabout the universe. Gravitational radiation is a totally new channel that would\nbe capable of giving information\nabout the structure\nand evolution of the universe.\n\nsymmetry. Thus, the "breathing"\nmode of the Moon,\nin which all points of the lunar surface move outward\n\nBASIC\n\ntogether,\nand half a cycle later, all points move\ninward together,\nis not expected\nto be driven by\ngravitational radiation. However, the "football"\nmode\nis expected to be excited by gravitational\nradiation.\nIn the "football"\nmode, all points on the lunar equator move outward at the same time that points on\nthe lunar poles are moving inward. Half a cycle later,\nall points on the equator are moving inward while\nthe polar regions are moving outward.\nVery little is known about possible sources of\ngravitational radiation. An object may emit considerable gravitational\nradiation\nand have very little\nemission of light and vice versa. At present, the search\nfor this radiation\nmust be made by developing the\nbest possible instruments\nand operating them at the\nlimits of sensitivity.\nApproximate\nestimates\nsuggest\nthat present procedures have a fair chance of observing real effects by using the Moon because of the\nrelative quiet of the lunar environment.\nThe Earth is also an instrumented\nantenna, but it\n\nTHEORY\n\nwith the gravitational\n\nThese forces are somewhat\n\nexcited.

By\ndelaying one recording relative to the other one, the\nrate of chance coincidences may be measured. A\nsignificant excess of zero-delayed as compared to\ntime-delayed (chance) coincidences can establish the\nexistence of correlations.\nExperiments have been conducted in the kilohertz\nregion using aluminum cylinder masses of several\nthousand kilograms that are isolated from terrestrial\neffects. The existence of such coincidences has been\nestablished using antennas at the University of Maryland and at the Argonne National Laboratory near\nChicago, Illinois. The high frequency (seismic output)\nof the LSG wl be compared with the records of the\nil\naluminum cylinder experiments in an effort to find\nnumbers of coincident amplitude increases over and\nabove the chance rate.\nThe LSG was also designed to measure the tidal\neffects on the Moon and to serve as a one-axis\nseismometer. The lunar orbit is slightly elliptical, and\nthe Moon undergoes librations. For these reasons, the\ngravitational fields of the Earth and Sun sensed by a\ngiven part of the lunar surface will vary with time.\nThis variation results in time-dependent tidal forces\non the Moon. The figure of the Moon will be\ndistorted in consequence of the tidal forces, and the\namount of this distortion gives information about the\ninternal composition of the Moon.\n\nEQUIPMENT\nThe LSG (fig. 12-1)was emplaced on the Moon by\nthe Apollo 17 crew, This instrument is a sensitive\nbalance with a mass, spring, and lever system and\nwith electronics for observation of accelerations in\nthe frequency range from 0 t o 16 Hz. The LSG has a\nnominal sensitivity of approximately one part in\nof lunar gravity.\nA schematic diagram of the spring-mass suspension\nsystem is shown in figure 12-2. In the instrument, the\nmajor fraction of the force supporting the sensor\nmass (beam) against the local gravitational field is\nprovided by the zero-length spring. A zero-length\nspring is one in which the restoring force is directly\nproportional to the spring length; such a spring is very\nuseful in obtaining a long-period sensor (ref. 12-9).\nSmall changes in force tend to displace the beam up\nor down. This imbalance is adjusted to the null\nposition by repositioning the spring pivot points by\n\nFIGURE 12-1 .-Lunar surface gravimeter.\nFixed\npivots\nI\n\n,.-.\n\n,\n\'\n\nMicrometer\n\n.\n\nZero-length\nspring\n\n.-\'\n\nCenter of gravity\nof be?m\n/\' CcLuUy\n\nFixed\npivot\n\nMovable\nbeam\n\nFIGURE 12-2.-Schematic\nsensor.\n\ndiagram of the lunar gravity\n\nuse of micrometer screws.

Both these goals were successfully\nachieved by the experiment.\nA gravity tie has been\nobtained between the Taurus-Littrow\nlanding site and\n\nof these\n\nBASIC\nFree-Air\n\ng,.--7\nThe free-air gradient\n\nThe\n\nbasic\n\ntheory\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\ncenter\n\nof the\n\nk,v\n\nagm = -21ciVl\n\n(13-1)\n\nz \'3\n\n-2gin\n\n=\n\n(13-2)\n\n2+\n\nduring each period\nand the free-air correction\nis 2gm/r, which yields a\nvalue of 0.19 mgal/m.\nThe elevation in meters is\nmeasured\nfrom an arbitrary\nelevation\ndatum (fig.\n13-1). The free-air correction\nis added to the relative\ngravity values to obtain the free-air anomalies.\nThe next step in the interpretation\nof the free-air\nanomalies\ninvolves\nthe Bouguer\ncorrection.\nThe\n\nAnomalies\ninterpretation\n\nof the\n\nBouguer correction allows for the gravity effect (i.e.,\nthe vertical component\nof the gravitational\nattraction) of the material above the elevation\ndatum\n\ntraverse gravity measurements\ncan be described with\nthe help of the sketch in figure 13-1. As a simplifying\napproximation,\ntwo-dimensionality\nis assumed; the\nsketch is a hypothetical\ngeological cross section. The\ngravity measurements\nare made at the lunar module\n(LM) landing site and at certain stations (stations 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, etc.). The gravity value at the LM site is\nsubtracted\nfrom the values at the other stations, and,\nfor this report, only the relative\nwill be considered.\n\nthe\n\nthen is\n\nal a\n\nTHEORY\n\nand Bouguer\n\nfrom\n\nMoon.

In the sketch in figure\n13-1, densities of p_ for the material comprising\nthe\nmassifs and P2 for the material of the valley floor\nhave been assumed. The fact that the actual situation\ncan be much more complicated must be considered\nthe interpretation\nof the Bouguer anomalies.\nIn gravity interpretation,\nthe Bouguer correction\n\nin\n\npoints as at the station where the correction is being\napplied. The second, the terrain correction,\nallows for\nthe departure of the actual terrain from a plane at the\nheight of the station. For the Taurus-Littrow\nlanding\nsite, the terrain corrections\nare large, and no particular advantage is gained by computing\nthe flat-plate\nBouguer corrections\nand the terrain corrections separately. By computing\nthe gravity effect of all the\nmaterial above the elevation\ndatum with a single\ncomputation,\nthe combined\nBouguer\ncorrection\nis\napplied, and, by adding it to the free-air anomaly, the\nBouguer anomaly is obtained. In these calculations of\nthe Bouguer corrections,\na flat Moon rather than a\nspherical\nMoon is used. The relative\nerror at the\nstations\n\nis negligible\n\nfor the present\n\nREPORT\n\nTwo-Dimensional\n\nAs a first approximation,\ntwo-dimensionality\nis\nassumed. The gravity effect of a body is obtained by\napproximating\nits cross section by an irregular polygon. The gravity effect of a body with a polygonal\ncross section has been given by Talwani et al.

Therefore,\nthe Bouguer\nin terms of, and provide\ndensity contrasts\nof rocks\n\nlying below the elevation datum.\nIn the simplified\nmodel shown in figure 13-1, for instance, the density\ncontrast Pl - P2 between the material comprising the\nmassifs and the material lying below the valley floor\ngives rise to the Bouguer anomalies at the stations.\nThe actual structural situations as well as the density\nvariations are probably much more complicated\nthan\nthose shown in the sketch. The interpretation\napproach will be to work with simple models consistent\nwith available geological information\nand to see how\nthese models explain\nthe gravity data. The final\nstructural solution will be constrained\nby the gravity\nresults, by considerations\nof geological plausibility,\nand by the results from the other geological and\ngeophysical data.\n\nCalculations\n\nFor more careful analysis of the gravity data, it is\nessential both to compute the Bouguer anomalies and\nto interpret\nthem without\nthe assumption\nof twodimensionality.\nThe basic formula used in this calculation is the gravity effect of a vertical prism, which is\ngiven by Jung (ref. 13-2). For distant areas, prisms of\nlarge area can be chosen and an average elevation\nassumed for them. For closer areas, prisms of smaller\narea must be chosen. By actual trial and error, prisms\nof optimum\narea are chosen at various distances from\nthe landing site for use in the calculations.\nSuch a\ndetermination\nhas been made. The three-dimensional\ncalculations\nare not complete at the present time, and\nonly the results of two-dimensional\ncalculations\nwill\nbe discussed\n\nin this report.\nEQUIPMENT\n\nThe final step is the interpretation\nof the Bouguer\nanomalies. The Bouguer anomalies have allowed for\nthe elevation differences\nbetween the different sta-\n\nanomalies are interpreted\ninformation\nabout,\nthe\n\nCalculations\n\nis\n\nusually applied in two steps. The first, the flat-plate\nBouguer, assumes that the elevation is the same at all\n\ndifferent\ntions.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nSensor\nThe gravity sensor used in the TGE is a Bosch\nArma D4E vibrating string accelerometer\n(VSA). The\naccelerometer\nis schematically\nshown in figure 13-2.\nEach of the two strings, when energized, generates\ncontinuous\nvibrations\nwith its own frequency,\nthe\nvalue of which depends on the value of g. The\ndifference\nbetween\nthe two frequencies\ncan be\nobtained.\nThe difference frequency\nbetween the two\nstrings Afn when the sensor\nposition can be written as\nAfn = k 0 + klg\n\n+ k292\n\nis in its normal\n\n+ k393\n\n+ ..o\n\nvertical\n\n(13-3)\n\nTerms of order higher than 3 can be neglected.\nNominal\nvalues for ko, kl, et cetera, for the flight\nvibrating\nstring accelerometers\nare ko = 7 Hz, kl =\n129 Hz/g, k2 = -0.00034\nHz/g 2 , and k3 = 0.003\nHz/g 3.

However, experience with sensors of this type had shown that ko is\nsubject to drift as well as tares (sudden dc shifts).\nAny shift of k0 would degrade the Earth-Moon\ngravity tie.

For\n\nBecause the lunar value of g is approximately\n163 000 mgal and a measurement\nto the precision of\n0.1 regal is desired, the difference frequency\nof the\nVSA must be measured to an accuracy of approximately 1 X 10 -6. Because the nominal values of the\ndifference\nfrequencies\nin the normal and inverted\npositions are approximately\n28 and 14 Hz, respectively, a simple counting of the cycles obviously will\ntake an impossibly\nlong time. Instead,\na gate is\ngenerated that is inversely proportional\nto the difference frequency. For the normal case, the gate consists\nof 1536 cycles of the difference\nfrequency\nAf n\n(approximately\n55 sec at this frequency);\nfor the\ninverted case, the gate consists of 384 cycles of the\ndifference frequency\nAf i (approximately\n27 sec).

For a small 0, the error is 0.5g02. The TGE is\ndesigned to keep 0 less than 00o03 \' Of arc and,\nconsequently,\nthe error caused by leveling less than\n0.06 mgal.\nTo provide the leveling, the sensor is mounted on a\ngimbaled frame. Two vertical pendulums mounted on\nthe gimbal frame sense departures\nfrom the vertical\nthrough comparator\ncircuits. These comparator\ncircuits provide information\nto stepping motors that\ndrive the gimbals until the pendulums are level. The\nleveling is accomplished\nin two modes.\nWhen a\npendulum is more than 00032 \' of arc from level, the\ncorresponding\nstepper motor slews faster; at less than\n00\xc2\xb032 \', the motor slews at a slower rate to avoid\novershoot. When the pendulums are within 00o03 \' of\narc of being level, the slew commands are disabled.\nWhen the instrument\nhas to be inverted in the bias\nmode, a set of bias pendulums\nis used that gives\nsignals unless the gimbal frame is similarly leveled in\nan inverted position.\nThe TGE can be leveled only if it is initially placed\nin a position less than 15 \xc2\xb0 from level. In the normal\nmode, time for leveling is between 0 and 20 sec; in\nthe bias mode, the time is between 90 and 130 sec.\n\nTemperature\n\nControl\n\nand Monitoring\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nthe precision heaters.

The displayed digit marks the\ndeviations of the precision oven temperature\nfrom a\npreset value.

The eighth\n\n13-5\n\nand ninth digits of the display are thermal monitors,\nas explained\nin the section entitled\n"Temperature\nControl and Monitoring."\nThe display stays on for 20 sec. The display can,\nhowever, be turned on at any subsequent\ntime by\ndepressing the "READ" pushbutton,\nand it stays on\nfor 20 sec.\nA measurement\nwith the sensor in the inverted\nposition\nis made by depressing the "BIAS"\npushbutton. The bias pendulums are used for leveling, and\nthe indicator light flashes on and off until the sensor\nis leveled in an inverted position.\nThe counting and\ndisplay then proceed as for the normal measurement.\nTo conserve power, a toggle switch is provided to\nselect the "STANDBY"\nor "ON" mode of operation.\nIn the "STANDBY"\nmode, power is supplied only to\nthe oven temperature\ncontrols\nand to the VSA\noscillator-amplifiers.\nCycling the switch from "ON"\nto "STANDBY"\nto "ON" will erase any stored data.\nDepressing\nthe "READ"\npushbutton\nafter such a\nswitching provides valid readings only for the eighth\ndigit, which is the temperature\nmonitor for the outer\noven and for the battery.\n\nR ES U LTS\nNumber\n\nof Readings\n\nOf the 26 readings obtained (table 13-I), three\n(readings 1, 10, and 18) were obtained to learn the\nthermal\nstate of the instrument\nbefore the EVA\nperiods. No gravity values were obtained with these\nreadings.\nReading 8 at the LM site showed that the TGE had\nbeen moved during the measurement\nas indicated by\nthe phase lock loop alarm, which gives zeros in the\nfirst three digits of the display in such instances. This\nreading, therefore,\nwas valueless, and another reading\nwas obtained at the same site.\nAt the LM site, nine readings were made. Six of\nthese were readings in the normal TGE position\n(upright) on the lunar surface (readings 3, 9, 11, 17,\n19, and 25); one reading was made at the start of\neach EVA and one at the end of each EVA. Two\nreadings (4 and 26) were made in the inverted\nposition to determine the value of the bias term ko at\nthe beginning\nand end of the measurements.\nOne\nreading (2) was made on the LRV to compare "on\nLRV" and "off LRV" measurements.\nBesides\n\nthe\n\nreadings\n\nat\n\nthe\n\nLM\n\nsite,\n\n11 other\n\n13-6\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nO\n\no\n\n6\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\no\n\n0\n\nE\n_MM\n\n_MMM\n\n_oo\n\nM\n\nM\n\nooooo\n\nO0\n\nO0_O0\n\no\n\n000\n\nI\n\nIII\n\nX\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIIIIIII\n\nllllll\n\nII\n\nllllll\n\n>\n\n>\n\n2\n\n_4\n\n0000000\n\n0\n\nIIII\n\nII\n\n._\n\nr_\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n"\n\n0\n\nI\n\nu_\nr_\n.<\n[-\n\nx\n\nN\no_\n\n....\n\n_\n_.,\n\n0\n\n_o\nN\n\nN\n\n......\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_.._..\n\n6\n\n._ ._ ._ ._ N ._\'_ ._\n\n.\'_\n\n._._oooog\n\n_\nMmm_mm\n\'"\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTRAVERSE\ndiscrete\n\nmeasurements\n\nwere\n\nGRAVIMETER\n\nmade at different\n\nsites\n\n(readings 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, and 23).\nTwo extra measurements\n(readings 22 and 24) were\nmade at stations 8 and 9 on the lunar surface to\ncompare\nsites.\n\non-LRV\n\nand off-LRV\n\nmeasurements\n\nat these\n\nIn the preliminary\nevaluation of gravity in table\n13-I, the constants\nk2 and k3 of equation (13-3) are\nignored and a value of kl = 0.0001318\nHz/mgal is\nassumed.

Therefore, it was\ndecided to adopt a zero drift rate unless the off-LRV\nvalues at the LM site showed\na consistent\ndrift\npattern. The off-LRV values at the LM site are given\nin table 13-II. Relative to the first reading, the gravity\nvalues range from 2.1 to -3.2\nmgal. The only\npositive\nvalue, 2.1 mgal, was reading 25. Before\nreading 25, during the traverse from station 9 to the\nLM site, the pallet on which the traverse gravimeter\nwas mounted swung open, and, as noted later in the\nTABLE 13-II.-Off-LR\nV\nAg Values at LM Site\nRelative to First Value\nObtained\n[rms deviation\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nreport, the resultant\nbanging of the pallet may have\ncaused instrument\nproblems resulting in an erroneous\nreading 25.

As shown in table 13-1II, the lunar\n\nsurface readings are, in all three cases, lower than the\nLRV values (the free-air difference is negligible) by\namounts ranging from 4.6 to 6.9 mgal. There is no\nexplanation\nfor this difference; however, on the basis\nof three readings, an empirical correction\nof -6.0\nmgal has been made to all on-LRV measurements\n(table 13-I). Some support for this correction comes\nalso from postmission\ntests with the engineering and\nspare flight models.

L. S]ogren, at I\xc2\xa2. R. Wollenhaupt,\n\nThe purpose of this experiment\nwas to measure\nthe variations in the lunar gravitational\nfield near the\ntrajectory\nof orbiting space vehicles (i.e., the command\nand service module\n(CSM) and the small\nparticles\nand fields subsatellites\nejected\nfrom the\nApollo 15 and 16 spacecraft).\nNew information\nhas\nbeen obtained\nfrom all Apollo orbiting spacecraft;\nhowever, this report shall be limited to the results\nfrom the Apollo 17 CSM and the Apollo 16 subsatellite.\nThe data acquisition\ntechnique\nand data\nreduction\nmethods have been presented\nin previous\nreports (refs. 14-1 and 14-2) and will not be discussed\nin this report. The data acquired are precise speed\nmeasurements\nof the orbiting spacecraft from which\naccelerations\nor gravity profiles may be inferred.\nFeature\nresolution\nis controlled\nby the spacecraft\naltitude and is almost a direct relationship\n(i.e., data\ntaken from a 50-km altitude\nwill resolve approximately a 50-km feature). Therefore, revolutions\n3 to\n12, when the CSM was in the low-altitude\norbits,\nprovided the clearest information.\nThe characteristics\nof the Apollo 17 CSM and the\nApollo\n15 CSM orbits were very similar. Consequently,\nsome of the larger lunar features were\ntraversed by both vehicles, permitting a broadening\nof\nthe detailed investigation\nof the Serenitatis, Imbrium,\nand Crisium mascons. At present, one gravity profile\nhas been reduced. The surface track of that profile\nand an Apollo 15 track are shown in figure 14-1. The\ncorresponding\ngravity profile is shown in figure 14-2.\nThese are line-of-sight accelerations\n(i.e., accelerations\nprojected\nalong the Earth-Moon\nline) and have no\ncorrections\napplied for altitude or viewing geometry.\nThe pronounced\nfeatures are again Mare Serenitatis\nand Mare Crisium; however, additional\nfeatures are\nidentifiable.\n\nExperiment\nb and R. N. Wimberly a\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nRESULTS\n\nA large negative\ngravity region 1 between\nthe\nSerenitatis and Crisium mascons is located very near\nthe Apollo 17 landing site (long. 30 \xc2\xb0 E, fig. 14-2).\nUsing this anomaly with a 43-percent increase attributable to least-squares\nfiltering (ref. 14-3) and with\nthe best estimate\nof the landing site lunar radius\n(1734.5 kin), an absolute gravity estimate of 162 722\nmgal is obtained.\nThis estimate compares favorably\nwith the traverse gravimeter result of 162 694 mgal\n(see. 13) and instills additional\nconfidence\nin the\nremote-sensing\nresults. The difference\nof 28 mgal\ncould be accounted\nfor by the altitude difference,\nbecause our result was obtained at spacecraft altitude\n(15 km) rather than at the surface, or by small local\nanomalies of this order as measured by the traverse\ngravimeter (see. 13).\nFarther west on the figure 14-2 profde, the Mare\nVaporum region (long. 3 \xc2\xb0 E) is a negative anomaly. A\nstronger negative anomaly at longitude 4.5 \xc2\xb0 W is over\npart of Montes Apenninus\nand between\ntwo ridge\nformations. At longitude 10 \xc2\xb0 W, the edge of the Sinus\nAestuum mascon was sampled. The small negative\nanomaly at longitude 20 \xc2\xb0 W is produced by the crater\nCopernicus.\nThe other\nanomalies\nacross Oceanus\nProcellarum\ndo not seem to correlate well with any\nvisible surface features; however,\nthey do correlate\nperfectly with previous work (refs. 14-4 and 14-5).\nThe 50-mgal high at longitude 66 \xc2\xb0 W is produced by\nGrimaldi (peak displaced because of geometric\neffect). When data from all 10 revolutions (3 to 12) are\nreduced, there will be 10 east-west Grimaldi profiles\nevenly spaced from the northern\nto the southern\nedge.\nSome of the most obvious\n\npoints\n\nconcerning\n\nthe\n\nt A negative gravity region, often referred to as a negative\nanomaly, is def\'med as a region having a mass deficiency with\nrespect to a homogeneous spherical body. A corresponding\ndefinition applies to a positive gravity region (or positive\nanomaly), sometimes called a gravity high.\n\naJet Propulsion Laboratory.\nbNASA Lyndon B.

A theoretical\ngravity profile for Apollo 17 revolution 5 was\ngenerated using the best model of Serenitatis developed from Lunar Orbiter V and Apollo 15 data.\nThe comparison of the actual and theoretical curves is\nshown in figure 14-3. There is approximately a\n40-percent error from the actual observations, showing that new information can be extracted from these\ndata. The same comparison is shown in figure 14-4\nfor the Crisium mascon, but the differences are\nrelatively small.\nThe Grimaldi anomaly was analyzed using a\nsurface disk model in which the mass, the radius of\nthe disk, and the longitude of the disk center were\nestimated simultaneously. Doppler data were generated with this model and reduced in precisely the\nSame manner as the actual observations.

(Contour units are in milligals.)\n\niterations using a least-squares criterion on the acceleratior profde yielded a mass of 1.03 X 10\'\' g\nand a radius of 70 km at -68" longitude. (Latitude\nwas held at -5.50".) The mass distribution from this\nresult yields 1000 kg/cm*, which is 25 percent higher\nthan that determined for the other mascons. These\nvery preliminary results may change when all profiles\nare analyzed together.\nThe Apollo 16 subsatellite at an orbital inclination\nof 9.5" provided new high-resolution observations\nover a region from latitude 9.5" N to 4" S and from\nlongitude 70" E to 70" W. The altitude was approximately 20 km at latitude 6" N, 40 km at latitude 3"\nN, and 60 km at latitude 4" S . The data were\nacquired during 68 revolutions, which provided\nhighly redundant coverage. The acceleration profiles\nfrom these revolutions have been contoured and\nsuperimposed on lunar charts. Only the central\n\nsection from longitude 30" W to 30" E is shown in\nfigure 14-5 because that section contains most of the\nnew features. A more detailed presentation is given in\nreference 14-5. The outstanding features are as\nfollows.\n1. The negative anomaly centered in Copernicus,\nwhich is another example of an unfilled crater having\na negative anomaly\n2.

Theoretical\nwork has been limited\nto the\nelectric and magnetic fields that result from dipole\nantennas\non plane, horizontal,\nlayered media.

References\n15-16 and 15-17 are\nespecially useful for layered media. Earlier application was to ground-wave\npropagation\nalong the\nsurface of the Earth, generally where the loss tangent\nof the Earth is large. The mathematical\nsolutions are\ninvolved; they were solved initially by Sommerfeld\nin\n1909 (ref. 15-2) with later (1926) correction\nof the\nfamous _\nsign error (ref. 15-18). A complete\nhistory, with proof of the existence of Sommerfeld\'s\ncontroversial\nsurface wave, is given by Bafios (ref.\n15-3). The resulting field equations (for electric field\nE and magnetic field H) depend on the nature of the\nsource. In theory, there are four source dipoles: the\nhorizontal\nelectric dipole (HED) and vertical electric\ndipole (wires), the horizontal\nmagnetic dipole, and\nthe vertical\nmagnetic\ndipole Cv\'MD). In the SEP\nexperiment,\na tuned series of wire antenna radiators\n(thus extensions\nof the elemental HED) is used, and\nthe cylindrical coordinate\nvalues of magnetic\nfield\nlip, He_, and H z are measured.\nThe major difference in typical ground-wave propagation from that on the Moon (or in earthbound\nglaciers and deserts) is in the low values of er and p\nfor the latter. For the case of a semi-infinite\nMoon\nbelow semi-infinite\n\n-\xc2\xa5,a-y^b\n\n= _-\' rad/m\n\nspace,\n\nthe solution\n\nis that for the\n\n=J\n\nF(X)e\n\n\'\n\nz H_(Xr)X\n\nclX (15-9)\n\nwhere the function\nF(},) is devoid of exponential\nbehavior, H i is the zero-order Hankel function of the\nfirst kind, and 7i = (X2 - k_) \'A may be called a\ncomplex propagation\nfactor (i = 1 denoting the lunar\nsoil and i = 2 the space above). The variable X used in\nequations (15-9) and (15-10) is a complex separation\n(or eigen) variable of integration\nand should not be\nconfused with the wavelength.\nIn a cylindrical coordinate\nsystem with the source\ndipole\nat a height\nh above the origin of the\ncoordinates\n(/9, \xc2\xa2, z), two essential integrals U(a,b,r)\nand V(a,b,r) are required to determine\nthe vector\npotential\nII from which the fields E and H are\nderived. The relationship\nof E and H is derived from\nMaxwell\'s\nequations\nand continuity\nrelations at the\nspace-dielectric\nplane boundary (z = 0). The U and V\nintegrals differ in the value of F(_) used; thus, for the\nV integral\nk2\xc2\xa5\n- k2-t\n1 2\n2 1\n\nr( x) =\n\n(I 5-10)\n\nwhere\n\nk\n2=\nkO\n\n2\n1\n\nN 2\n\n+\n\n1\n\n(15-11)\nk1\nk.\nN =_=--!=_\nk2\n80\nIn equation\n(15-11),\nthe refractive\nindex N (eq.\n(15-4)) is the reciprocal\nof n used by Bafios (ref.\n15-3) and others.\nFor evaluating a component\nof the magnetic field\n(e.g., Hz) in the SEP experiment,\nthe U integral is\nrequired (actually the partial derivative of U). Here,\na = 0, b = h + z, and the exponential\ninvolving a in\nequation\n(15-9)\nis unity;\nthus, U is written\nas\nU(O,b,r). If h = 0, then U becomes U(O,z,r).\nThe integral solution\ninvolves, generally,\nsaddle-\n\nSURFACE\nELECTRICAL\nPROPERTIES\nEXPERIMENT\npointor double-saddle-point\napproximation\nmethods\n(ref. 15-3). owever, h = z = 0, the solution for\nH\nif\nU(O,O,r) is exact,\n\nas found\n\nby Van der Pol. Thus, the\n\nexpressions for H z waves broadside\nwire (HED) are exact as are those\n\nto the horizontal\nfor the tangential\n\ncomponent\nof electric field E_ (V/vlD) (first noted by\nWait (ref. 15-16)). If h or z (or both) are nonzero\nvalues, approximate\nmethods\nmust be used; these\n\ninterfere. An example is shown in figure 15-2 for H z\nlateral waves broadside to an HED for several values\nof erl and Pl = 0.03. The lateral\nwave is that\ncomponent\nof energy traveling in the dielectric but\nrefracting across the boundary\nto reach the receiver\nat height h = z.\nFor typical terrestrial\nsoils, the loss tangent p of\nthe ground is so high that the lateral wave is relatively\ntoo small to be observed. However, in glaciers, polar\nregions, and deserts, such interference\npatterns\nas\nthose shown in figure 15-3 may be observed.\n\nStratification\n\nTwo Layers.-Wave\npropagation\ngions has been treated\ngenerally\n\nin stratified\nreby Brekhovskikh\n\n(ref. 15-17) and Wait (ref. 15-16); the properties\nof\nantennas\nin such regions have been discussed by\nGalejs (ref. 15-15).

The numerical integration\nmethod (refs. 15-8\nand 15-19) provides quite exact solutions but requires\nmuch computer\ntime; however, the method provides\na check on other techniques\nand can be extended\nreadily to large numbers\nof layers. In the GOA\nmethod, the problem is treated in terms or rays (thus,\ndistances must be large compared with various wavelengths); therefore,\nsolutions\nthat are readily interpretable against a background\nof physical optics are\nprovided.\nUnfortunately,\nthe GOA is invalid for\n"\'thin" layers, the case for both glaciers and the Moon\nfor at least some of the SEP experiment\nfrequencies.\nThe formulation\nand solutions for certain parameters\nare given in references\n15-6 and 15-8.

The lack of agreement between\nthe GOA and\nthe numerical integration\nat distances less than 7_ is\ncaused by the approximations\nin the GOA and\nindicates clearly that the proper solution\nmust be\nchosen for a particular\nexperimental\nsituation.\nThe\nnormal mode solution, valid for thin layers such as\nappear to be present at the Apollo 17 site, was\nformulated by Tsang, Kong, and Simmons (ref. 15-8).\nWe are rather sure that our various formulations\nof\nthe solution\nare correct.\nThese formulations\nhave\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n15-6\n\nFree space sr\n\n=\n\n1\n\n___--Numerical integration\n\nI\n\n4\n\n5\n\nI\n\n6\n\n7\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n8\n9\n10\n11\nDistance, wavelengths\n\nI\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nFIGURE 15J.-Cornparison of the geometrical optics approximation (dashed curve) with the Tsang exact solution\n(solid curve), obtained by numerical integration, for a\nsingle-layer case (ref. 15-8).

Lunar\n\nand\n\nEjecta\n\nMeteorites\n\nO. E. Berg, at F. F. Richardson,\n\nFor the past 20 yr, astronomical\ninterest in the\ncosmic dust particle has been partially dominated by\na concern for the mechanical devastation imparted by\nmeteoroid impacts or the so-called meteoroid hazard.\nToday,\nthe meteoroid\nhazard has been accurately\nevaluated\nand found to be essentially\nnonexistent\n(ref. 16-1). Now we are witnessing\nan interesting\nperiod of transition\nfor cosmic dust studies from\nsimply determining\nthe number and size of particles\nimpinging on a certain area in a certain time to an\nastronomical\ninterest in the nature and the source of\nthe material. The cosmic dust particle is emerging as a\nmuch more interesting\nobject than its larger cousin,\nthe meteoroid,\nwhich is often seen blazing a path\nacross the atmosphere\nof the Earth. Both are affected\nby gravity, solar wind erosion, and planetary\natmospheres, but, because of its small size and consequently its high surface-to-mass\nratio, the micrometeoroid\nis also significantly\naffected by solar radiation pressure, magnetic fields, electric fields, and probably the\nshadow or umbra of the Earth. The extraterrestrial\n\nExperiment\n\na and H. Burton a\n\nbecome molten and behave similarly to liquid masses.\nSecondary\nparticles\n(or lunar ejecta)\nare ejected\nradially and at high velocities from the impact site.\nThe volume\nof lunar ejecta material\nrelative\nto\nprimary particle volume and the range of velocities\nfor lunar ejecta are currently\nconjecture\nbased on\nlaboratory\nstudies using hypervelocity\nprojectiles.\nLunar ejecta mass is probably\ncomparable,\nin most\ncases, to the mass of the impacting\nmeteoroid.\nLaboratory\nstudies have shown that ejecta velocities\nmay exceed the primary particle velocity, but, in\ngeneral, it is assumed that a relatively small percentage of the ejecta particles have velocities in excess of\nthe lunar escape velocity of 2.4 km/sec;\nthus, the\nbulk of material returns to the lunar surface (ref.\n16-3). The LEAM experiment\nintercepts\nejecta particles and records information\nuseful in establishing the\nhistory of the Moon.\nThe manner in which interstellar particles or grains\ninvade our solar system is depicted in figure 16-2. Our\n\nmicroparticles\nencountered\nby the lunar ejecta and\nmeteorites\n(LEAM) experiment\nmay be divided into\nthree distinct\nand interesting\nclasses: lunar ejecta,\ninterstellar grains, and cometary debris.\n<2.4 sec\nkml\nOBJECTIVES\n>2.4\nkmlsec\nThe lunar ejecta particle depicted in figure 16-1 is\nthe offspring of a meteoroid encounter with the lunar\nsurface. The Moon, like the Earth, is continually\nbombarded\nby meteoroids\ntraveling at hypervelocities\n(speeds in excess of the speed of sound in a material\n(ref. 16-2)). The lunar surface, unprotected\nby an\natmosphere,\nreceives the impact at full velocity from\n2.4 to 72 km/sec. Because of the high velocity, the\nprojectile\n\naNASA\n1"Principal\n\nand\n\nGoddard\n\nthe\n\nimmediate\n\nSpace\n\nFlight\n\narea\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nimpact\n<2.4 kmlsec\n\nCenter.\n\nFIGURE 16-1.-Lunar\n\nInvestigator.\n\n16-1\n\nejecta.\n\n16-2\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nEarth\n0-_.\n\nat 1AU\nkm/sec\n\nx_>40\n\nI\n/\n//\n\nOrbitof the\n\n20-kmlsec\n\n]solar apexvelocity\nrelativeo\nt\nnearbytars\ns\n\nFIGURE 16-2.-Interstellax grains. Interstellar grains <40\nkm/sec axe trapped by the solar system; those >40 km/sec\npass on through.\nSun and its planets are moving through the Milky\nWay Galaxy at approximately\n20 km/sec relative to\nnearby stars. In so doing, our solar system passes\nthrough "clouds" of interstellar dust (ref. 16-4)with\nrelative encounter velocities approaching and possibly\nexceeding\n100 km/sec.\nAlthough\nthe particles are\nextremely\nsmall (probably\n10 -Is g), their detection\nprobability\nby the LEAM experiment\nis high because\nthe experiment responds to the cube of the particle\nvelocity; thus, it is extremely\nsensitive to high-speed\nparticles. Two forerunners\nof the LEAM experiment,\nin the heliocentric\nsatellites Pioneer 8 and 9, have\ndetected two (and possibly more) interstellar\ngrains\nthat are believed to be the first impact registrations of\nthis type of particle (ref. 16-5). Because the LEAM\nexperiment\nmeasures\nparticle\nspeed,\nradiant\n(or\nsource) direction,\nand particle\nkinetic energy, the\nencounters\nby interstellar\ngrains may be readily\ndistinguished\nfrom encounters\nby other types of\ncosmic dust.\nCometary debris is considered\ncomponent of cosmic dust within\nis generally accepted that comets\nsnowballs" with nuclei diameters\n\nthe most abundant\nour solar system. It\nare gigantic "dirty\non the order of 10\n\nkm and are principally composed of frozen mixtures\nof gases and liquids (ref. 16-6). Embedded\nin this\n"snowball"\nare solids ranging in diameters\nfrom\ntenths of micrometers\nto large boulders. As the comet\napproaches\nits perihelion, as shown in figure 16-3, it\nundergoes partial disintegration\nbecause of the effects\nof radiation pressure and spews out a tail of gases,\nvapors, and solid particulates.\nFor larger comets, the\ntail is often visible to the eye as diffuse illumination\npointing away from the Sun. Large particulate\nmatter\nmay\n\nseparate\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\nparent\n\nA\n\ncomet\n\nand\n\nattain\n\na\n\nD\nFIGURE 16-3.-Cometary\n\ndebris.\n\nheliocentric\norbit similar to its parent;\nthe large\nparticulates\nwill remain in this orbit until they are\nperturbed\nby other planets or bodies or collide with\nthe Moon, the Earth, or other planets. These large\nparticulates\nare the blazing meteoroids\nmentioned\npreviously.\nAfter separation\nfrom the parent comet,\nthe smaller particulates,\nmicrometeoroids,\nbehave\nmuch less predictably\nbecause they are affected by\ntwo forces: the force of gravity, which is a function\nof the particle mass and therefore\nthe cube of the\nparticle\nradius\n(4/31rr a) and the force\nof solar\nradiation pressure, which is a function of the crosssectional area of the particle and therefore the square\nof the radius 0rr 2). If the force of radiation pressure\nexceeds\nthe force of gravity\nat the moment\nof\nseparation\nfrom the parent comet, the particle will\nassume a hyperbolic\nin figure 16-3, and\nsystem. If the force\nradiation pressure at\n\ntrajectory, as shown for A and B\nthe particle will leave our solar\nof gravity exceeds the force of\nthe moment of separation\nfrom\n\nthe parent comet, the particle will spiral in toward\nthe Sun very slowly under the Poynting-Robertson\neffect. Here again, as postulated,\na second separation\nof particles occurs (ref. 16-7). Because of their heat\ncapacity, the larger dust particles continue\ninto the\nSun and are absorbed,\nas shown by C. As the smaller\ndust particles approach to within a few solar radii of\nthe Sun, they partially evaporate, and, because the\nrelative mass or gravity (r 3) reduction is faster than\nthe relative cross-sectional\narea (r 2) reduction,\nthe\nforce of radiation pressure soon exceeds the force of\ngravity for the particle, and it is ejected quasi-radially\nfrom the Sun, as depicted by D.\nEssentially\nall the particles\nintercepted\nby the\nPioneer 8 and 9 instruments\nwere outgoing particles,\n\nLUNAR EJECTA AND METEORITES EXPERIMENT\n\nsuggesting ejected cometary fragments rather than\nparticles in elliptical orbits (ref. 16-8). Accordingly,\nthe LEAM experiment is shielded by the Moon from\nprimary particle impacts during lunar night. However,\nthe formation and presence of lunar ejecta from large\nmeteoroid impacts are quite independent of lunar\nday/night conditions-a set of conditions that helps\nto distinguish between impacts by primary particle\nevents and impacts by lunar ejecta. During each lunar\ncycle, each of three sensor systems incorporated into\nthe LEAM experiment is alternately exposed to and\nshielded from impacts by these particles.\nThe position of the LEAM experiment on the\nlunar surface and the associated alternated exposure\nand shielding feature of the sensor systems offer an\nopportunity for the experiment to verify Earth\nfocusing effects (fig. 164). Microparticles that are\nejected, one way or another, into our solar system\nwill tend to be ejected radially away from the Sun.\nFor simplicity, microparticles are shown as having\nparallel trajectories in figure 1 6 4 . As they are blown\npast the Earth, they are perturbed toward the Earth\nand tend to focus into a concentration extending\noutward from the shaded side of the Earth. Thus, as\nshown in figure 1 6 4 , the LEAM experiment will,\nonce per lunar cycle, be ideally exposed to this\npostulated concentration and/or perturbation effects.\n\nTHE LEAM INSTRUMENT\nThe major objectives of placing a cosmic dust\nexperiment on the Moon can readily be met by the\nLEAM instrument (fig. 16-5). This instrument measures the particle speed, particle direction, total particle energy (kinetic), and particle momentum for\nparticles having parameters as shown. The LEAM\n\nc\n\nSunlight\n4\n\nc\n\nFIGURE 164.-Earth focusing effect.\n\n16-3\n\nFIGURE 16-5.-The LEAM experiment, which responds to\nimpacts of microparticles having a mass as low as\ng,\na diameter as small as 2 X lop5 cm, and a speed as high\nas 75 km/sec.\n\nexperiment consists of three sensor systems: the east\nsensor, the west sensor, and the up sensor. Only the\nup and west sensors are visible in figure 16-5.\nThe basic sensor for each array is shown schematically in figure 16-6. The basic sensor consists of a\nfront (A) fdm-grid sensor array and a rear (B)\nfdm-grid sensor array spaced 5 cm apart (film plane\nto fdm plane) and an acoustical impact plate upon\nwhich the rear film is mounted. The performance of\nthe sensors depends upon two basic measurable\nphenomena that occur when a hypervelocity particle\nimpacts upon a surface: the formation of a plasma\nand a transfer of momentum.\nIn conjunction with the following explanation of\nthe operation of the LEAM experiment, refer to\nfigure 16-6 and consider three probable types of\ncosmic dust particles: a high-energy hypervelocity\nparticle (>1 .O erg); a low-energy hypervelocity particle (<1 .O erg); and a relatively large high-velocity particle (>lo-\'\' 8). The third type includes the majority\nof lunar ejecta particles. As a high-energy hypervelocity particle enters the front film sensor, it yields\nsome of its kinetic energy toward the generation of\nionized plasma at the front film. Electrons from the\nplasma are collected on the positively biased grid\n(t24 V), producing a negative-going pulse that is\n\n16-4\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nCosmic ust\nd\nparticle\n\n\\\nFr\xc2\xb0nt\n\n(A)\n\nfilm-\n\nI_\n\n9ridsensor\nT\narray 5 cm\n\n-7V\n\n+24V-3.5V\n\nREPORT\n\nsensor systems that comprise the east and up sensor\narrays.

A pulse-height\nanalysis is performed\non\nthe positive output signal as a measure of the kinetic\nenergy of the particle.\nAs a relatively large high-velocity\nparticle enters\nthe LEAM experiment,\nit may pass through the front\nand rear film sensor arrays without\ngenerating\na\ndetectable ionized plasma but still impart a measurable impulse to the acoustical sensor. In this event, a\npeak-pulse-height\nanalysis is performed on the acoustical sensor output pulse.\nAn electronic clock registers the time of flight of\nthe particle as the time lapse between positive pulses\n(front film and rear film output signals), which is\nused to derive\nthe speed of the particle.\nThe\ntime-of-flight\nsensor represents\none of 256 similar\n\nconsequently,\nthis array has no capability to measure\nparticle speed. Figure 16-7, an exploded schematic of\nthe overall\nLEAM experiment,\nshows that\nfour\nvertical film strips are crossed by four horizontal grid\nstrips to affect 16 front and 16 rear film sensor\narrays,\ncreating\n256 possible\ncombinations.\nEach\ngrid strip and each film strip connects to a separate\noutput\namplifier.\nThe output\nsignals from these\namplifiers are used to determine the segment in which\nan impact occurred.\nThus, knowing what front film\nsegment was penetrated\nand what rear film segment\nwas affected\nby an impact,\nthe direction\nof the\nincoming particle can be determined\nwith respect to\nthe sensor axis and, eventually, to the Sun.\n\nSENSOR\n\nCONTROLS\n\nAn ideal sensor control is one that is exposed to\nthe same environment\nas the active or main sensor.\nEnvironment\nencompasses\nelectrical\nand magnetic\nradiation, thermal radiation, thermal gradients, and so\nforth. Controls\ninstalled somewhere\nin the experiment and sheltered\nfrom the total environment\nare\nineffective. The controls used in this experiment\nare\ndesigned to perform,\nas much as possible, under the\nsame conditions as the main sensor. An upper portion\nof the rear film array and a lower portion of the front\nfilm array of the east sensor system are used as\ncontrols\nfor the plasma sensors. An epoxy resin\ncoating covers the control grids and films, isolating\nthem from the products of ionization\ncaused by impacts on their area (e.g., electrons and ions generated\nby hypervelocity\nimpacts on the epoxy cannot be\ncollected\non the grids or films). However, the resin\ncoat does not constitute\na shield from electrical or\nmagnetic radiation.\n(Thermal noise is not an important factor\nin ionization\nsensors.) A microphone\ncontrol is unique in that it is a "live microphone"\nattached\nto a separate impact plate having one-third\nthe effective\narea of the main microphone\nplate.\nThus,\nthe control\nis truly exposed\nto the same\nenvironment\nas the main microphone\nsensor, including impacts by cosmic dust; an approximate\nratio of\n1:3 would\nbe expected\nbetween\nimpacts\non the\ncontrol and impacts on the main microphone\nsensor.\n\nLUNAR\nEJECTANDMETEORITES\nA\nEXPERIMENT\nA-filmareblifiers\n\n?\nI\n\nA-fi Im bias(-3.5 V)\n\n<3-\n\nK\n\n<]-\n\n/\n\n<3-\n\nA-gridbias(+24V)\nOutergrid\nbias(-7 V)\n\n(a)\n\nB-filmamplifiers\n\n----\'VV\'\n\nII. !\nI1\n\nB-filmbias(-3.5 V)\n\n<3-"\n\n[\n\n<3-\n\nI\n[\n1\n\nB-grid\namplifiers\n\n(10\n\n-13\n\ng\n\nto\n<\n\nhigh-density\nmass\n\n,(10\n\n-9\n\ng)\n\nhard\nand\n\nspheres\nof iron\nto velocities corre-\n\nsponding to the low end of the meteoroid\nvelocity\nspectrum\n(1 to 25 km/sec).\nAccordingly,\nwhen\nconsidering the sensitivities of the sensors as derived\nfrom these calibrations,\nthe possible latent discrepancies must be considered that may become manifest in\nsubsequent measurements\nin space when the sensors\nare exposed to projectiles of diverse density, structure, composition,\nand higher velocities.

An automatic\nheater in the LEAM experiment\nturns on at 0 \xc2\xb0 F (255 K) and off at 9 \xc2\xb0 (261 K). The\nheater is designed to remain on continuously\nduring\nlunar night and to keep the LEAM experiment\ntemperatures\nabove -24 \xc2\xb0 F (242 K).

This large daytime\nincrease suggests that most of the lunar gases are\nreadily adsorbed\non the cold nighttime\nsurface.\nHodges and Johnson (ref. 17-5) have shown that gases\nthat are not likely to be adsorbed\nat night, such as\nneon and nitrogen, should be distributed\nin concentration as a function of temperature\n(T -5/2) and thus\nhave nighttime maximums.\nContaminant\ngases originating from the lunar module (LM) or from other\nALSEP experiments,\nor being adsorbed on surfaces in\nthe site area could be influencing\nthe daytime cold\n\nspectrometer,\ncalled the lunar atmospheric\ncomposition experiment\n(LACE), was carried to the Moon as\npart of the Apollo lunar surface experiments package\n(ALSEP) to study the composition\nof and variation in\nthe lunar atmosphere.\nThe instrument\nwas successfully deployed in the Taurus-Littrow\nvalley with its\nentrance aperture oriented upward to intercept\nand\nmeasure\nthe downward\nflux of gases at the lunar\nsurface (fig. 17-1).\nInitial activation of the LACE instrument\noccurred\non December\n27, 1972, approximately\n50 hr after\nsunset, and operation continued\nthroughout\nthe first\nlunar night. Sunrise brought a high background\ngas\nlevel and necessitated\ndiscontinuing\noperation during\nlunar daytime except for a brief check near noon.\nNear sunset, operation\nwas resumed and continued\nthroughout\nthe night. This sequence was repeated for\nthe second and third lunations.\n\ncathode\ngage readings,\nalthough\nsuch outgassing\nwould have to exhibit very stable long-term\nrates\nbecause of the repeatability\nof the data from day to\nday. If the daytime maximum is a natural feature of\nthe atmosphere,\nthen it is probably\na result of\ncondensable\ngases, some of which may be of volcanic\norigin, while the nighttime\nlevel represents the noncondensable gases.

Of these sources, the only one amenable\nto prediction\nof the composition\nof the lunar\natmosphere\nis the solar wind. Thermal escape is the\nmost rapid loss mechanism for light gases (hydrogen\nand helium).\nFor heavier gases, photoionization\nfollowed by acceleration\nby the solar wind electric field\naccounts for most of the loss.

The\nentrance aperture covered by a nylon dust screen is at the\nlower right corner of the instrument. The mass analyzer is\nmounted behind the front cover with the electronics in a\nbox to the rear. The white dust cover on top protects the\nmirrored surface during mission activities and LSPE\nexplosive package detonations. The instrument package\nmeasures 34 by 32 by 17 cm and weighs 9.1 kg. The cable\nconnecting the spectrometer to the central station is at\nthe bottom of the photograph (AS17-134-20498).\n\nas electron emitters. In the normal mode of operation, the fmed mode, the electron bombardment\nenergy is fxed at 70 eV with the electron emission\ncurrent regulated at 250 PA. This produces a sensitivity to nitrogen of 5 X\nA/torr, sufficient to\nmeasure concentrations of gas species in the 1 X\n10-15-torr range. An alternate mode, the cyclic\nmode, provides four different electron energies (70,\n27, 20, and 18 ev) that are cycled by successive\nsweeps of the mass spectrum. Identification of gases\nin a complex mass spectrum is greatly aided when the\nspectra are taken at several different electron ionization energies because the cracking patterns of complex molecules are strongly dependent on the bombardment electron energy. Also, at low energy, many\ngas species are eliminated from the spectrum, thus\ngreatly simplifying the task of identifying parent\nmolecules.\nTwo small heaters, consisting of ceramic blocks\n\nwith embedded resistors, are mounted in the ion\nsource, enabling its temperature to be raised to 520 K\nfor in situ outgassing. The gas entrance is pointed\nupward and has a dust trap around the source region\nthat precludes the possibility of dust falling into the\nsource itself.\nVoltage scan of the mass spectrum is accomplished\nby a high-voltage stepping power supply. The ionaccelerating voltage (sweep voltage) is varied in a\nstepwise manner through 1330 steps from 320 to\n1420 V with a dwell time of 0.6 sec/step. Each step is\nsynchronized to a main frame of the telemetry\nformat. Ten steps of background counts (zero sweep\nvoltage) and 10 steps of an internal calibration\nfrequency are inserted between sweeps, making a\ntotal of 1350 stepslspectrum. The sweep time is 13.5\nmin.\nIn a alternate mode, the sweep voltage may be\nn\ncommanded to lock on to any of the 1350 steps,\nenabling the instrument to monitor continuously any\ngiven mass number peak in the spectrum with a time\nresolution of 0.6 sec/sample. A one-step advance\ncommand is also available. The lock mode permits\nhigh time resolution monitoring of mass peaks that\nmay be suspected to be of volcanic origin.\nThe sweep step number, being a function of the\nion-accelerating voltage, is directly related to ion mass\nnumber. Each sweep step number, in turn, is uniquely\nrelated t o a main frame telemetry word. Therefore,\nword position in the telemetry format serves as the\nidentifier of atomic mass number in the spectrum.\nIons accelerated from the source region by the\nsweep voltage are collimated into a beam and directed\nthrough a magnetic field of 0.43 T. Three allowed\ntrajectories (of radii 1.21,4.20, and 6.35 cm) through\nthe magnetic field region define the locations of three\ncollector slits. Figure 17-2 is a schematic drawing of\nthe analyzer showing the major parts and the three\nion beam trajectories. Thus, three mass ranges are\nscanned simultaneously, namely 1 to 4 , 1 2 to 48, and\n27.4 to 110 amu, termed low-, mid-, and high-mass\nranges, respectively. The advantage of a triplechannel\nanalyzer is that a wide mass range may be scanned by\na relatively narrow voltage excursion. Also, the midand high-mass ranges are so related that mass 28 and\n64 peaks are detected simultaneously. Therefore, in\nthe lock mode, carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur\ndioxide (SOz), which may be candidates for volcanic\ngases, can be monitored simultaneously.\nResolution of the analyzer is set at approximately\n\nLUNAR\nATMOSPHERIC\nCOMPOSITION\nEXPERIMENT\nElectron\nmultipliers ..\n/ \',,\n/\'\n\n--..\n",,\n"\n\n/\n,,\'\n\nI nletplenum\n.....\nBreakseal...

All the data presented\nin this section\nhave been obtained\nfrom quick-look\ncharts such as\nfigure 17-3 and are considered\npreliminary\nat this\ntime.\nEach of the major peaks in the spectrum in figure\n17-3 will be discussed in turn and will be given a\ntentative identification,\nwhich is essential in trying to\ndetermine\nits origin (native or artifact).\nAlthough\nmany of the mass peaks observed undoubtedly\narise\nfrom outgassing of the instrument\nor other materials\nat the landing site, three gases have been identified\nthat are believed native to the Moon-helium,\nneon,\nand argon.\nPeaks at mass 1, 2, and 4 are identifiable\nin the\nlow-mass channel. Mass 1, atomic hydrogen, is almost\ncertainly due to dissociation\nof artifact hydrocarbon\nmolecules and other hydrogen compounds,\nincluding\nmolecular\nhydrogen,\nin the ion source.\nMass 2,\nmolecular\nhydrogen,\nresults largely from outgassing\nof the ion source, as it is steadily decreasing with\ntime. Eventually, a stable hydrogen peak may appear\nthat will then probably\nbe truly lunar hydrogen.\nDuring the third lunation,\nthe minimum\nhydrogen\nconcentration\nobserved was 1 X l0 s molecules/cm 3 ,\nwhich is approximately\na factor of 5 greater than the\ntheoretical\nvalue of Hodges et al. (ref. 17-8). In the\ndaytime, when the mass 2 peak is somewhat larger, a\nmass 3 peak appears that is 0.03 percent\nof the\nhydrogen peak (close to the isotopic ratio for HD of\nterrestrial\norigin), which supports the hypothesis\nof\nthe hydrogen source as artifact. The helium at mass 4\nis certainly\nnative and will be discussed\nin more\ndetail.\nThe ramp commencing\nnear the mass 2 peak is\nprobably\ndue to an electronic\ncoupling of spurious\ncounts into the detector.\nThe amplitude\nof the ramp\nis somewhat\ntemperature\nsensitive\nand its onset\nposition is variable. Although it appears to be large on\na logarithmic\nscale, the amplitude\nof the ramp has a\nmaximum\nvalue of 300 counts/main\nframe, which is\nnot seriously detrimental\nto reduction of the data; it\nrequires,\nfor example,\na correction\nof 10 to 20\npercent or less for most peaks except in the 12-to\n18-amu range where it is somewhat larger.\nIdentifiable\npeaks in the mid-mass range, beginning\nat the right with mass 15 and 16, may be methane\nwith some contribution\nat mass 16 from atomic\noxygen. Mass 17 and 18 are primarily due to water\nvapor and are relatively\nsmall, implying\nthat the\ninstrument\nis surprisingly\nwell degassed\nof water\n\nLUNAR\nATMOSPHERIC\nCOMPOSITION\nEXPERIMENT\nvapor. ven\nE in\n\nthe daytime,\nthe mass 18 peak\nlarge relative to other peaks.

Native argon-40 (4\xc2\xb0Ar) has been identified\nat other times and its diurnal\nbehavior\nwill be\ndiscussed later. Mass 44 is CO2, thought to originate\nprimarily\nfrom outgassing\nof the instrument.\nThe\n\nMass 19 being a dominant\npeak is a puzzle. The\nH30 + ion is precluded\nbecause of the small H20\n\nremaining\nprincipally\n\npeak. Fluorine\nis the only other possibility.\nThis\nimplies that much of the mass 20 peak may be\nhydrogen fluoride (HF) instead of neon. The mass 20\npeak is smaller than the mass 19 peak by a factor of 3\nat night and larger by the same factor in the daytime.\n\nThe high-mass range spectrum duplicates the mid\nrange below mass 44. Additional peaks of significant\namplitude\nare the group near mass 61 and peaks at\nmass 78 and 85 that, as yet, are unidentified.\nThe\nlatter two are continuing\nto decrease in amplitude\nwith time and are not considered\nsignificant.\nThe\nunresolved\nset of peaks from 91 to 93.5 amu is\n\nThe origin of the fluorine is unknown,\nbut possibilities are the outgassing of solvents used in cleaning the\ninstrument\nbefore\nflight, the outgassing\nof other\nwarm areas of the site (e.g., instruments,\nthe central\nstation, or the radioisotope\nthermoelectric\ngenerator),\nor the natural\ndegassing of the lunar materials. To\nstudy the neon question further, the temperature\nof\nthe ion source was reduced from 270 K several times\nduring the lunar night by turning off the fdament for\nperiods of approximately\n30 min. Reactivation\nof the\nfilament just before scanning the mass 20 to 22 range\nrevealed stable, net mass 20 and 22 peaks with an\namplitude ratio of approximately\n13, in close agreement with the solar wind isotopic\nratio of neon\ndetermined\nby Geiss et al. (ref. 17-9). The mass 44\npeak was not large enough at the time to contribute\nsignificantly to the mass 22 peak as a doubly ionized\nspecies. A neon concentration\nof 7 X 104 molecules/\ncm a results, which is a factor of 20 less than that\n\nmid-mass peaks are mainly hydrocarbons\nfrom outgassing of the ion source.\n\nprobably doubly charged species in the mass 182 to\n187 range that are the isotopes\nof tungsten\nand\nrhenium, originating\nfrom vaporization\nof the filament. The group near mass 61 may be triply charged\ntungsten and rhenium. At this measured vaporization\nrate (concentration\nof 1 \xc3\x97 103 molecules/cma),\nthe\nuseful filament\nlifetime is estimated at 10 yr. The\nremaining\npeaks are again thought\nto be artifact\nhydrocarbons.\nFigure 17-4 is a reduced spectrum\nderived from\nraw data by subtracting\nfrom each peak amplitude\nthe counts in the adjacent valleys due to background\nnoise and scattered\nions. Small-angle\nscattering\nof\nions from neutrals\nin the mass spectrometer\nis a\nstrong function\nof pressure but does occur to some\n\npredicted by Johnson et al. (ref. 17-2).\nThe mass 28 peak is probably nitrogen or possibly\nCO, and mass 32 corresponds\nto oxygen. These will\nbe discussed subsequently.\nPeaks at mass 35, 36, 37,\nand 38 fall into the same category as mass 19 and 20,\nmost likely being chlorine\nand hydrogen\nchloride\n\n103 _\n\n102e-\n\n(HC1). The mass 35 to 37 ratio corresponds\nto the\nterrestrial\nchlorine isotopic\nratio. As with fluorine,\nthe origin of the chlorine is undetermined\nbut is\nlikely the same as that of fluorine. The ion source\ntemperature\nreduction\ntest was conducted\nfor the\nmass 36 and 40 range also. The mass 36 and 38 peaks\ndecreased to essentially zero; the mass 40 peak also\nwas essentially\nzero, indicating\na late night upper\nlimit for any of the argon isotopes less than 200\nmolecules/cm a. These tests indicate that the formation of HF and HC1 is strongly temperature\ndependent and may arise from a reaction with hydrogen in\nthe ion source Hz + F2 = 2HF or H2 + C12 = 2HC1.\n\nE\n\n101_\nt...l,\n\n10o\n\n50 60 70\nAtomicmassnumber\n\n80\n\nI\n100\n\nFIGURE 17-4.-Reduced spectrum taken 100 hr before\nsunrise of the third lunar night after deployment\n(16:30:00 G.m.t., Mar. 5, 1973).

However, the corrections\nfrom\nscattering\nare typically\nless than 5 percent\nand\nfrequently less than 1 percent. The accuracy of peak\namplitudes at this stage of data analysis is estimated\nto be +30 percent with some of the very small peaks\nhaving an uncertainty\nof a factor of 2. Most of the\nerror comes from using the quick-look-type\ncharts as\nthe data source. The data are shown as counts/main\nframe as a function\nof atomic mass number. Differences between\nthe mid- and high-mass overlapping\nranges are removed\nby averaging.\nCounting\nrates\n(sec -l) can be obtained\nby multiplying\neach peak\namplitude by 1.65. The example given in figure 17-4\nis data from the third lunar night, a few calendar days\nlater than the spectrum of figure 17-3. At this time,\nthe ion source temperature\nhad been reduced from its\nnormal operating level of 270 K to near 200 K by\nturning the ion source off for approximately\n30 rain\nbefore the measurement.\nThe minimum\nnighttime\ntotal gas concentration\nobserved\nto date is 4.6 \xc3\x97 l0 s molecules/cm 3, of\nwhich nearly 20 percent is hydrogen and 25 percent\nis mass 19, both of which are believed to be artifact.\nIn addition, neon and helium, both believed to be\nnative, exist at the 15-percent\nlevel. The total gas\nconcentration\nat noon of the second lunation\nis\n4 \xc3\x97 l0 s molecules/cm a , of which 25 percent\nis\nhydrogen and 7 percent is mass 36 (HCI), with the\nremaining peaks all lower in abundance.\nWater vapor\nis 5 percent of the total. All the large peaks are\nbelieved\nto be dominated\nby outgassing\nof the\ninstrument,\nthe LM, the landing site, and so forth, in\nthe heat of the day.\nDiurnal variation\nof helium-4 (4He) is shown in\nfigure 17-5, starting\nwith first activation\nof the\ninstrument\non December 27 at a solar zenith angle of\n-155 \xc2\xb0. Time progresses to the right through the lunar\nnight and into the day. The first lunation continues\nto sunset (-90\xc2\xb0).\nThe complete\nsecond lunation is\nalso shown ending at sunset (Feb. 22, 1973). The\ndashed curve indicates regions where the instrument\nwas not operating. No significance is attached\nto the\nlack of tracking\nof the two curves because the\ndifferences\nare within the errors associated\nwith\nreading quick-look\ndata. Helium concentration,\nplotted along the ordinate,\nis shown\nto vary from\napproximately\n2 \xc3\x97 103 molectdes/cm 3 at lunar noon\nto 4 X 104 molecules/cm 3 near midnight.

Concentration is\nplotted as a function of solar zenith angle with nighttime\nin the center of the figure. The distribution is typical for a\nnoncondensable gas.\nthe very low level of the daytime helium (only three\ndata counts\nafter a correction\nfor residual helium\nwithin the instrument\nis made based on preflight\nmeasurements\nof the helium and hydrogen ratio of\nlaboratory\nspectra), the night-to-day\nratio of helium\ncan only be roughly estimated\nto be in the range of\n15 to 30. This distribution\nis generally what would be\nexpected\nof a noncondensable\ngas; that is, one that\ndoes not freeze out at the lunar nighttime temperature of 85 to 90 K (ref. 17-5).\nThe present measurement\nagrees with the daytime\nhelium concentration\nof 3 X 10 a molecules/cm 3 predicted by Johnson et at. (ref. 17-2). Hodges et al. (ref.\n17-8) have done a Monte Carlo calculation\nof the\ndistribution\nof solar wind helium around the Moon\nand found an equatorial\nnight-to-day\nconcentration\nratio of 24, which should be slightly greater than at\nthe 20 \xc2\xb0 latitude\nof the instrument\nlocation.\nThis\ndistribution\nleads to a theoretical\nnighttime concentration of 4.1 X 104 molecules/cm 3 and a daytime\nvalue of 1.7 X 103 molecules/cm 3 for the same solar\nwind flux used by Johnson et al.

Concentric with and surrounding the\ncentral rod is an open, cylindrical frame structure (rib\ncage) around which sheets of the plastic detector are\nwrapped. The 235U\ntargets are mounted in discrete\npositions over windows in the rib cage (fig. 184). A\ncontinuous, black-anodized tube (not shown in fig.\n18-1) is used as a casing to enclose and protect the\ntarget-detector systems.\nThe probe is activated and deactivated by a 180\'\nrotation of the central rod with respect to the rib\ncage (fig. 18-1). In the activated configuration, the\nuranium-mica and the boron-plastic target-detector\npairs are brought into alinement. In the deactivated\nconfiguration, the uranium and boron targets are\nadjacent and the mica and plastic detectors likewise.\nIn the latter configuration, particles emitted from the\ntarget surfaces cannot enter the respective detectors;\nthus, the probe is deactivated. The activation and\ndeactivation mechanism was necessary to prevent the\naccumulation of background events from neutrons\nproduced by cosmic ray interactions in the spacecraft\nand by the plutonium-238 power source for the\nApollo lunar surface experiments package (ALSEP),\nthe radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG),\nwhich is a strong neutron source ( ~ X lo\'\n7\nneutrons/sec).\nFigure 18-5 is a schematic, cutaway view of the\nLNPE showing the manner in which the various\ndetectors were deployed along the length of the\nprobe. For reference, the theoretically predicted\ndepth (in units of grams per square centimeter)\nprofile of the neutron capture rate is plotted. To\npermit accurate definition of the flux profile, the\nlength of the probe was chosen to be 2 m, a depth\nwhich is well below the theoretically predicted peak\nof the profile (= 150 g/cm*). The boron-plastic\ndetection system was essentially continuous along the\nfull length of the probe. As shown in figure 18-5, 16\nuranium targets and mica detectors were mounted at\neight discrete locations along the probe. The\nb\n\nFIGURE 18-3.-A photograph of two rectangular mica\ndetectors mounted on flats in the central rod. The mica\ndetectors are 1.8 cm long.

Visible are one of the open\nwindows and a window covered with a 235U\nmetal target\nthat has, in turn, been completely covered with aluminum\nfoil to prevent the registration of alpha particles in the\nplastic detectors when they are wrapped onto the rib\ncage. The windows are 1.2 cm long.\n4\n\nuranium-mica target-detector pairs were mounted\nwith uniform separations in the lower half of the\nprobe but were closely spaced and concentrated\ntoward the top in the upper half of the probe. This\narrangement was chosen for two reasons. First, the\ntemperature of the probe was expected to be highest\nnear the surface, and the investigators were concerned\nabout thermal annealing of the tracks in the plastic\ndetectors. Fission tracks in mica are not annealed\neven at peak lunar surface temperatures; thus, if data\nwere lost in the plastic at the top of the probe, the\nmica data would still provide the near-surface record.\nSecond, from theoretical predictions, the lowest track\ndensities were expected near the surface, and results\nfrom the Apollo 16 cosmic ray experiment (ref.\n18-18) suggested that these densities might be quite\n\nN\n\n5\n\n7 lo3\n\nLNPE handle\n\nTheoretical profile\n\n"\nm\n\nL\nL\n\nL\n\n1\n\nb\n-\n\n0\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n300\n\n400\n\nI\n\n100\n\n200\nDepth, glcm\'\n\n235U-mica detection system\n\n*\n0\n\n238U fiducial system\nKBr capsules\n\nt Cadmium-wrapped sections\nm\nFIGURE 18-5.-A schematic view of the lunar neutron probe\nshowing how the various targets and detectors are\ndistributed with depth and including the theoretically\npredicted track density versus depth curve. The \'OB\ntargets and plastic detectors (not shown) are essentially\ncontinuous along the entire length of the probe.\n\nLUNAR NEUTRON PROBE EXPERIMENT\nlow. At such densities, mica detectors give more\nreliable results than plastic detectors.\nAlso displayed in figure 18-5 are the locations of\nthe two cadmium absorbers near the bottom and\nmiddle of the probe. A 0.46-mm-thick cadmium sheet\nwas wrapped around the rib cage over the plastic\ndetector at each site (fig. 18-6). The evacuated KBr\ncapsules were inserted at the top, middle, and bottom\nof the probe, as shown. In addition, three point\nsources of uranium-238 (%) were mounted near\n\'U\nthe bottom, middle, and top of the probe in flats\nmilled on the side of the central rod on which the \'OB\ntargets were mounted (fig. 18-2). The reason for\nincluding the point sources was twofold. The alpha\nparticles emitted by these point (1 to 2 mm) sources\nregistered in the plastic detectors only while the\nprobe was activated and thus provided fiducial marks\nfrom which the proper activation of the probe can be\nverified. Also, from the track densities and the\nappearance (length, width, etc.) of the 238U alphaparticle tracks, it will be possible to determine\nwhether the tracks in the plastic detectors have been\nthermally annealed during and after the activation\nand the lunar surface exposure.\nIn wrapping the plastic sheets on the rib cage, an\noverlapping second layer was placed over the window\nareas, primarily to secure the plastic to the rib cage\nbetter. Because the second layer is never exposed to\nany of the targets, however, four small portions of\nplastic in this outer layer were preirradiated with a\nknown dose of 238U alpha particles to provide an\nadditional check on thermal annealing in the plastic.\nFurther, the areas of the plastic detectors in t h s\nsecond layer that are not preirradiated provide a\ncontinuous record of background events resulting\nfrom cosmic rays and tracks produced by nuclear\ninteractions (recoils) of the RTG fast neutrons with\nthe plastic. Based on analyses of small pieces of the\nTriafol TN plastic carried on the Apollo 15 spacecraft, the background from cosmic ray alpha particles\nand heavy ions was expected to be negligible. The\nApollo 16 cosmic ray experiment results had suggested that the plastic would register tracks from\nfast-neutron interactions (ref. 18-18). Separate experiments using both\ncalifornium-252 and\nFIGURE 18-6.-A portion of one of the fully assembled rib\ncages. Two plastic detectors and one of the cadmiumwrapped areas are shown. The cadmium cylinder is 7.5 cm\nlong.\n\n18-5\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n18-6\n\nplutonium-beryllium (Pu-Be) neutron sources have\nshown that fast @lev) neutrons produce tracks with\nan efficiency of = 2 X\nFor this efficiency, an\nRTG fast-neutron background track density of = 150\ntracks/cm2 is expected in the plastic during the flight\nto the lunar surface. This value is not large compared\nto predicted \' B alpha-particle track densities\nO\n(> 1000 tracks/cm2).\nTo provide an actual measurement of the maximum temperature exposure of the LNPE, temperature indicators were fastened to flats in the central\nrod at four positions along the probe (fig. 18-3). Each\ntemperature indicator contained four separate\ntemperature-sensitive compounds that irreversibly\nturn black at 140\xc2\xb0, 160\xc2\xb0, 180\', and 200" F (333,\n344,355, and 366 K), respectively.\nThe completely assembled flight unit is shown in\nfigure 18-7. For convenient stowage on the spacecraft, the LNF\'E was fabricated in two 1-m-long\nsections that could be activated separately. The upper\nsection (on the right in fig. 18-7) was activated by\ndepressing a bar on the large handle at the upper end\nand rotating the handle 180\'. The lower section was\nactivated by removing the dust cap at its upper end\nand using it as a tool to rotate the central rod. The\ncenter rod was spring loaded to snap into one of two\nstable configurations differing by a 180\' rotation.\nAfter activation, the two sections could be coupled\nfor deployment by simply screwing the two sections\ntogether.\n\nTargets and Detectors\nThe boron targets were prepared with a process\nespecially developed for this experiment. The \'OB is\nvacuum deposited as metallic boron by the thermal\ncracking of diborane onto 0.05-mm-thick tantalum\nhalf cylinders. The deposition temperature was approximately 1073 K. The \'OB targets were made\n"infinitely thick"; that is, they were deposited to an\naverage thickness of 1.4 0.2 mg/cm2, which is\ngreater than the range of the 1.6-MeV alpha particles\nemitted with neutron capture on \'OB.

Alpha-particle\ncounts were determined\nfor\neach target to verify the relative quality and uniformity of the targets used.\nExperimentation\nwith Triafol TN has shown that\nthis plastic is somewhat\nnonuniform\nin its track\nregistration\nproperties.\nExposure\nto monoenergetic\naccelerated\nalpha particles indicates an energy registration\ninterval\nfrom _0.25\nto 2.5 MeV, which\nprobably\napplies to most samples. However, some\nbatches of plastic show considerably\nreduced sensitivity, which is critically dependent\non whether the\nirradiations\nare performed\nin air or in vacuum. One\nbatch in particular will not register alpha particles in\nvacuum\nbut does in air. These phenomena\npresumably reflect the critical role played by oxygen in\ntrack formation\nin plastic. This oxygen influence has\nbeen studied previously by Monnin (ref. 18-19) and\nby Crawford et al. (ref. 18-20). Because of the lack of\nuniformity,\nthe registration\nproperties\nof representative samples of the plastic used for the flight unit\nwere determined\nby using vacuum neutron irradiations of the plastic samples exposed to a l\xc2\xb0B target.\nThe registration\nof the plastic was uniform to better\nthan -+ 10 percent over an area of _ 0.3 m 2 . Comparison of air and vacuum registration\nshows a small\nvacuum effect, with the vacuum registration\nefficiency being less by approximately\n12-+ 3 percent.\nBefore incorporation\ninto the probe, the plastic\nand mica detectors\nwere preannealed\nto remove any\npossible background\ntracks. Preannealing\nof the mica\nwas particularly\nimportant\nbecause muscovite,\nlike\nmost natural micas, has a nonnegligible\ndensity of\nfossil fission tracks from the spontaneous\nfission\ndecay of trace uranium\nimpurities.\nThe mica was\nannealed at 903 K for 3.5 hr; the plastic, at 389 K for\n9 days. In addition\nto being preannealed,\nthe mica\nwas pre-etched\n4 hr in 48 percent hydrofluoric\nacid\n(HF) at room temperature\nand then silver coated\n(_ 30 nm thick). Because normal etching time for\n\n18-7\n\nfission tracks in muscovite mica usually is 20 min to 1\nhr, any small, shallow pits left after the preannealing\nappear\nas huge, shallow\ntroughs\nand cannot\nbe\nconfused\nwith\nthe\nsmaller\ndiameter\nlunarneutron-induced\nfission tracks. The silver coating was\napplied to monitor any possible flaking of the prime\ndetecting surface of the mica. The coating does not\naffect the registration properties of the mica.\nThe techniques\nused for preparing\nthe detectors\nfor data analysis are standard. The mica detectors are\nfirst desilvered in a 35-percent solution of HNO3 and\nthen etched in 48 percent HF for 25 min or 1 hr.\nData reported in this section are from samples etched\n25 min and scanned in an optical microscope\nat\n630 \xc3\x97 magnification.\nSamples etched 1 hr have larger\ntracks and are scanned at a lower (500 \xc3\x97) magnification. When a sample was etched for 25 rain and\ncounted, then etched further to 1 hr and recounted,\nthe results agreed within one standard deviation. The\nplastic detectors\nare etched in a bath consisting of\nfive parts 12 percent sodium hypochlorite\nand seven\nparts 6.25N sodium hydroxide\nat 313 K. The alphaparticle tracks in Triafol TN range only to approximately 4/am in length and, consequently,\nare scanned\nat a magnification\nof 1000\xc3\x97.\n\nThe\n\nLNPE\n\nDeployment\n\nThe deployment\nof the LNPE was nominal. The\nLNPE was retrieved from the modularized\nequipment\nstowage assembly (MESA) where it was stowed and\nwas loaded\non the lunar roving vehicle at the\nbeginning of EVA-1. To prevent overheating,\nthe two\nsections were kept in a thermal bag during the EVA\nactivities before actual deployment.\nFollowing\nthe\nALSEP deployment,\nthe deep drill corestem sample\nwas acquired at a site approximately\n40 m north (ref.\n18-21) of the ALSEP central station and the RTG\npower source. After the recovery of the deep core,\nthe two LNPE\nsections\nwere removed\nfrom the\nthermal bags, activated, coupled, and emplaced in the\ndeep drill corestem\nhole. The insertion\nwas made\nafter first passing the probe through the hole in the\ntreadle used for recovering the deep core. The treadle\nwas used because, in retrieving the deep core, the top\nof the hole had been widened; thus, the possibility\nexisted that the probe would drop too far into the\nhole to be retrieved. Full emplacement\nof the LNPE\nwas achieved manually. The deployment\nsite was in a\nshallow depression\nand behind a meter-sized\nrock,\n\n18-8\n\nAPOLLO\n17PRELIMINARY\nSCIENCE\nREPORT\n\nwhich\nshould provided\nhave\nadditional\nshielding\nfrom\ntheRTG\nneutrons.\nToprevent\noverheating,\nthetopof\ntheprobe\nprotrudingbove\na\nthesurface\nwascovered\nwiththethermal during\nbag\nexposure.\nTheLNPE\nwas\nrecovered,\ndecoupled,\ndeactivated,\nandreturned\nto\nthelunarmodule theveryendof EVA-3, fter\nat\na\naccruing ofexposure.\n49hr\nThe\nLNPEhas\nbeen\nreturned theinvestigators\nto\nand been\nhas\ndisassembled.\nThetargets detectors\nand\nareinexcellent\ncondition;\nnoflaking observed\nwas\nin\nthemica\ndetectors ontheboron\nor\ntargets.\nFurthermore, he temperature\nt\nindicatorshowed\ns\nthatthe\nprobeemperature\nt\ndidnotreach 33K.\n3\n\n1400\n1200\n\xc2\xa2J\n\n-_ lOOO\n\n/\n\nP\n20O\n\nI\nI00\n\nO\n\n18-8.-Comparison\nthe mica detectors\n\nprof\'de\n\nDepth\n\nProfile\n\nof the 235U Fission\n\nRate\n\nTo date, only the mica detectors\nhave been\nexamined. The processing of the plastic detectors has\nbeen delayed in order to explore a suggestion I for\nprocessing the plastic that may produce better developed tracks, which would be easier to recognize\nand count.\nFigure 18-8 is a plot of the experimental\ndata\n(shown as points in the figure) from nine of the 16\nmica detectors;\nat least one mica from each of the\neight distinct\npairs located\nalong the probe was\nsampled.

No adjustment\nof the\ndepth scale has been made. Because the neutron\nenergy spectrum\nbelow approximately\n1 eV is expected to be independent\nof depth except for the\nfirst few centimeters,\nthe theoretical\nprofile defines\nthe depth dependence\nof the neutron capture rate for\nall elements that capture\nneutrons\nin this energy\nregion.\nThe depth\nprofile assumes a uniform\nchemical\ncomposition\ncorresponding\nto Apollo\n11 sample\n10084; however, from the work of Lingenfelter\net al.\n\nMichel Monnin, private communication, 1973.\n2 D.

Only the latter depends\non the chemistry,\nbeing governed\nby the most\nabundant\nelements,\nsilicon and oxygen, the abundances of which do not vary appreciably\nfrom site to\nsite on the Moon. If the chemical composition\nin the\ndeep drill corestem sample is not homogeneous\nand if\nthe concentrations\nof either the major-element\nneutron absorbers (primarily\ntitanium\nand iron) or the\ntrace-element\nabsorbers (for instance, the rare-earth\nelements) vary significantly,\nthe variations will have\nto be considered in the final comparison between the\ntheoretical\nand experimental\nprof\'des.

The quantity of R/2 is the average\ndepth from which fission fragments produced in the\nuranium will register in a mica detector placed on the\nsurface of the uranium (2rr geometry).\nIn the actual\nexperimental\nconfiguration,\nbecause of the necessity\nfor the on-off mechanism,\nthe targets and detectors\nwere not in contact; G is the factor that accounts for\nthe decrease in detector\nefficiency\ncaused by the\nrequired separation. A correction for self-absorption\nf\nmust be applied because the target materials in the\nneutron\nprobe are strong neutron absorbers;\nconsequently,\nthe neutron\nflux and hence the measured\ntrack densities\nin the presence\nof the probe are\nsomewhat\ndepressed compared to their values in the\nabsence of the probe materials. As defined in equation (18-1), f is a dimensionless\nconstant and must\nhave a value t> 1. The values for f, R, and G are\nobtained\nfrom laboratory\ncalibration\nexperiments.\nEquation (18-1) is also applicable to the boron-plastic\nsystem if the factor R/2 is replaced by R/4. This\n\n(18-1) may be slightly less than measured\nradiochemically. Based on natural-uranium/mica\ndetectors\nirradiated\nin 27r geometry\nin a well-thermalized\nneutron flux, monitored\nby goldfoil activation,\nan\neffective range of 8.4 X 10 -a g/cm 2 is obtained for\nthe standard etching and scanning conditions.\nThe\nfollowing two methods have been used to determine\nG.\n1. The neutron\nprobe was assembled with some\nmica samples mounted\nin direct contact\nwith the\nstandard configuration\non the center rod fiats. After\nneutron irradiation,\nG was calculated from the ratio\nof the fission track densities in the mica samples on\nthe center rod to the mica samples irradiated in 2rr\ngeometry.\n2. The probe was assembled\nwith pieces of the\nplastic detector mounted on the center rod fiats and\nalso in contact with the uranium targets. The value\nfor G was calculated\nfrom the ratio of the uranium\nalpha-particle\ntrack densities in the center rod plastics to those in contact\nwith uranium,\nas in (1).\nGood agreement\nwas found between\nthe G values\nobtained (0.60 -+ 0.02) by using these two methods.\nTo eliminate self-absorption\neffects, natural uranium\nwas used for all determinations\nof R and G values.\nAt present,\nabsolute\nfission\n\nthe principal\nuncertainty\nin the\nrate lies in the value of fi The\n\ndetermination\nof f is more complicated\nthan the\ndetermination\nof the other factors in equation (18-1)\nbecause the value of f varies with neutron energy.\nHowever, it is possible to estimate f using only the\ngeneral features of the lunar neutron energy distribution without\ndepending\non the accuracy\nof the\ntheoretical\nenergy spectrum.\nThe calibration\nproce-\n\n18-10\n\nAPOLLO PRELIMINARY\n17\n\ndures used to date have been designed to determine f\nusing neutron\nenergy spectra\nthat are harder and\nsofter than the lunar spectrum and thus bracket the\nlunar self-absorption\nfactor.\nLunar material is a good absorber of low-energy\nneutrons; thus, the neutron energy spectrum in the\nregion below 1 eV will be significantly\nshifted to\nhigher energies compared to the Maxwell-Boltzmann\ndistribution\nthat would be expected if the low-energy\nneutrons were able to come into thermal equilibrium.\nThis shift is shown, for example, by the measured\nratio of samarium\nto gadolinium neutron capture in\nlunar samples, which is much higher than the ratio\nexpected for a thermalized\nneutron energy distribution (ref. 18-2).\nBecause\nneutron\nself-absorption\nis greatest\nat\nthose energies at which the fission cross sections are\nlarge and because the 23sU fission cross section ts\nhighest at low neutron\nenergies, the self-absorption\nfactor obtained\nin an irradiation\nwith a thermal\nspectrum will be an upper limit for the value of f that\nis appropriate for the lunar data.\nA calibration\nirradiation\nwas performed\nin a\nwell-thermalized\nneutron flux, and f was determined\nby comparing\ntrack densities\nfrom the actual 23sU\ntargets with those\nfrom much more dilute 23SU\ntargets, consisting\nof either natural uranium\n(0.72\npercent 23sU) or depleted\nuranium (0.409 percent\n23sU), in which the self-absorption\nwas negligible.\nThe 235U targets were mounted\nat one end of the\nprobe in the actual experimental\nconfiguration,\nincluding I\xc2\xb0B targets on the center rod. At the other\nend of the probe, isolated from any l\xc2\xb0B targets, the\nnatural- and depleted-uranium\ntargets were similarly\nmounted. The measured value off thus includes the\neffect of the l\xc2\xb0B targets on the 23sU fission rate as\nwell as the effect of the 23su foils themselves.\nA\nself-absorption\nfactor of 1.37 + 0.04 was obtained.\nThus, the value for fhas been bracketed:f_<\n1.4 and\nf_> 1 (by definition).\nConsequently,\nf= 1.2 -+ 0.2 has\nbeen adopted as the self-absorption\nfactor appropriate for the lunar 23sU fission rate. Additional\ncalibration using a harder flux will yield a somewhat\nmore precise value for f by providing an experimental\nlower limit.\nUsing the values of R, G, and fgiven previously,\n23sU fission rate of 3.5 -+ 0.6 fissions/g(23SU)-sec\n\na\nis\n\nobtained at a depth of 150 g/cm 2, which approximately corresponds\nto the peak of the neutron flux\nprofile.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nFor comparison,\nthe theoretical\ncan be calculated by\n\nn = Sfo\n\nNoe(E)_(E)Og\n\n23sU capture\n\nrate\n\n(18-2)\n\nwhere N is the number of 23Su atoms per gram, OF is\nthe fission cross section for 23su, E is neutron energy,\n_E) is the energy distribution\nof the neutron flux as\ncalculated by Lingenfelter\net al. (ref. 18-15), and S is\nthe ratio of the cosmic ray neutron production\nrate\nfor the 2 days when the neutron probe was deployed\non the lunar surface to the average rate over the 1 l-yr\nsolar cycle.\nAlthough\nS can be estimated\nfrom\nterrestrial\natmospheric\nneutron\nmonitor\ndata, this\nestimation\nhas not yet been made. For the present,\nS= 1 should be a reasonable\nestimate\nbecause the\nApollo\nbetween\n\n17 landing\noccurred\nat a time roughly\nsolar maximum\nand minimum and because\n\nneutron\nmonitor\ncounting\nrates do not show longterm time variations\nlarger than approximately\n20\npercent.

This value is a\n\nreasonable\napproximation\nto the Apollo 17 conditions,\nbut the actual\nApollo\n17 chemistry\nand\ntemperature\nwill be used in the final comparison.\nThe\ntheoretical\nvalue obtained\nfor 150 g/cm 2 is 3.2\nfissions/g(23sU)-sec;\nthus, within the present experimental uncertainties,\nagreement is obtained between\nthe experimental\nand theoretical\ncapture rates. However, it should be emphasized\nthat this agreement\nmay be somewhat fortuitous.\nIn particular,\nno reliable estimate of the error in the assumption\nofS = 1\nis available currently.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough\nthe analysis is still at a preliminary\nstage, it appears that good agreement exists between\nthe experimental\nresults and the theoretical\ncalculations of Lingenfelter\net al. (ref. 18-15). If the\nsubsequent\nrefinement\nof the experimental\ndata and\nof the theoretical\npredictions\nconfirms\nthis agreement, the conclusions\ndrawn previously\nfrom lunar\nsample data and the theoretical\ncalculations\ncan be\naccepted with some confidence.\nThe following discussion is based on this assumption.\nSome justification\nis required for the assumption\nthat agreement\nbetween the theoretical\nand experi-\n\nLUNAR\nNEUTRON\nPROBEXPERIMENT\nE\n\n18-11\n\nmental\ncapture\nrates for 23sU (or I\xc2\xb0B)implies\nagreement for other elements.

This\n\nsurface has remained uncratered\nfor a relatively long\nperiod (_ 500 \xc3\x97 106 yr). The LNPE data show that\nthe difference\nbetween\nthe observed and the theoretical peak depths cannot be ascribed to the uncertainties in the theoretical\nflux profile but, instead,\nmust reflect a recent (_< 50 X 106 yr) deposition\nof\n50 g/cm 2 of material at this site. The deposition\nmay have resulted from a single event or from a large\nnumber of events.\n\nargument\nis illustrated\nin figure 18-9, in which the\nfraction of neutron captures that occur at different\nneutron\nenergies for these nuclei is shown. These\ncurves were calculated\nusing the neutron\nenergy\nspectrum\nof Lingenfelter\net al. (ref. 18-15). The\ncurves for lS7Gd, l\xc2\xb0B, and 2aSu are qualitatively\nsimilar and peak at much lower energies than the\ncurve for la\xc2\xb0Ba or 79Br, although\n23su has a distinct\ncontribution\n(_ 20 percent) from neutron capture at\nenergies higher than 10 eV. In all cases, a neutron\nenergy\nspectrum\nmust\nbe assumed\nin order\nto\ncalculate the relative capture rates of 2aSu or I\xc2\xb0B to\nother nuclei. Figure 18-9 shows that the uncertainties\nin the neutron energy spectrum are less important for\n*STGd than for 13\xc2\xb0Ba or 79Br. The _gBr capture rate\nwill be measured\ndirectly\nfrom the KBr capsules\ncontained in the LNPE.\n\nEven after allowing\ntainties that currently\n\nstrong constraints\non the interpretation\nof the measured neutron\nfluences\nin lunar soil samples. As\ndiscussed extensively in previous papers (refs. 18-1,\n18-3, and 18-13),\nthe observed\nfluences\nin soil\nsamples from all Apollo missions are much lower than\nexpected for material that has resided in the upper\nfew meters of the lunar surface for times corresponding to the age of the site. One interpretation\nis that\nthe low fluences reflect deep mixing of the lunar\nregolith on a 1 X 109-yr time scale by which the\n\nThe gadolinium\nand samarium isotopic variations\nmeasured in the Apollo 15 deep core sample showed\na distinct\npeak at _ 200 g/cm 2, which is approxi-\n\nA130Ba\n\nA\'\n-3\n\n-2\n\nobserved fluences for surface soil samples are diluted.\nHowever, the required mixing depths calculated from\nthis model using the theoretical\nlSTGd capture rate\nare high; for example, approximately\n15 m for Apollo\n11, a depth which is roughly 3 times greater than\nregolith depths\nestimated\nfrom photogeology\n(ref.\n18-24). The LNPE data indicate that this factor-of-3\ndifference cannot be ascribed to inaccuracies\nin the\n\n79Br\n\ntheoretical\ncapture rates used previously.\nThus, if a\nregolith depth of 5 m is accepted as correct for the\nApollo\n11 site, it must be concluded\nthat the\npreviously\nmentioned\nuniform mixing model is not\nvalid and that the lunar regolith has not been well\nmixed to a depth\nof 5 m over a time scale of\napproximately\n1 \xc3\x97 10 9 yr.

A solar flare\nthat occurred during the Apollo 16 mission made it\npossible to obtain unique and important\ninformation\nconcerning\nsolar flares, particularly\nat low energies\n(refs. 19-1 to 19-5). However, the great abundance of\nsolar flare particles created a background\nthat made it\nimpossible to realize many of the original objectives\nof the experiment.\nIn mid-1972, a group of investigators proposed the\nLSCRE particle detector described in this report for\nthe Apollo 17 mission. Because of the short time\navailable before the mission, the proposed experiment\nwas designed to have minimal weight and to require\nminimal astronaut time on the lunar surface. In part\nA of this section,\na general description\nof the\nexperiment and its deployment\non the lunar surface is\ngiven. A status report on the scientific results being\nobtained with the mica detectors is also presented.

M. Walker, a E. Zinner, a and M. Maurette b\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nOF THE\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nIn the Apollo 17 lunar surface cosmic ray experiment (LSCRE),\none set of particle\ndetectors\nwas\nmounted\ninside a shallow,\nrectangular\naluminum\nbox; a separate set was mounted inside a sliding cover\n(fig. 19-1). The box was deployed in sunlight and the\nsliding cover in shade. The detectors mounted in each\npart are listed in table 19-I; the detector numbers are\nkeyed to figure 19-1(c). Both the Sun half and the\nshade half had temperature\nlabels on the sides\nopposite those on which the detectors were mounted.\nIn each half, the mica detectors (numbers 1 and 13\nin fig. 19-1(c)) consisted of a single slab of cleaved\nmuscovite that had been previously annealed for 100\nhr at 853 K in an argon atmosphere\nto remove fossil\ntracks. The mica detector\nalso had 18 spots, each\n0.24 cm in diameter,\nof evaporated\nsilver deposited\non the external surface to aid in distinguishing\nsolar\nwind particles from more energetic, penetrating\nparticles. One-third of these spots had a metal thickness of\n_55 nm; the remaining two-thirds\nwere equally divided between thicknesses\nof _100 and -_150 nm.\nThe mica plates were held in position with two metal\nstraps and were also lightly tacked down with spots\nof Dow Corning 6-1104 silicone glue.\nTwo mica detectors\n(number\n6 in fig. 19-1(c))\nwere also mounted\nin rectangular\nrecesses milled in\nthe edge of the Sun half. The purpose\nof these\nauxiliary mica detectors was to determine the precise\norientation\nof the Sun during exposure\nfrom the\nshadowing of solar wind tracks by the edges of the\nrecess. Because the mica was intended\nprimarily to\ndetect solar wind particles, careful microphotographs\nof all mica pieces were taken using oblique lighting,\nboth before and after the mission, to assess the degree\nof dust covering.\nThe 5-pm-thick\nplatinum\nand aluminum\nfoils\n\naWashingtonUniversity, St. Louis, Missouri.\nbLaboratoire Ren6 Bernas, Orsay, France.\n\n(numbers 2, 3, and 12 in fig. 19-1(c)) were glued to\n1.5-mm-thick\naluminum\nwith 3M 467 adhesive film.\nThe plates were in turn glued into the box and cover.\nIn addition, two platinum foils 5 by 0.8 and 9.5 by\n0.8 cm were glued into recesses on the sides of the\nbox (numbers 7 and 8 in fig. 19-1(c)). The different\norientations\nof foils as well as the use of different\nmetals (platinum\nand aluminum)\nwere to provide\nredundant\ninformation\non the direction\nof the light\nsolar wind and also to look for a flux of low-energy\nions at large angles to the solar wind direction.\nThe glass detectors (numbers 4, 5, 9, and 10 in fig.\n19-1(c)) are described in more detail in part B of this\nsection.\nFor a description\nof the Lexan detector\n(number 11 in fig. 19-1(c)), see part C.\nThe LSCRE was transported\nto the Moon in the\nclosed position, in which both sets of detectors were\ninside the box. In this position,\nthe end rings, one\nattached\nto the box and one attached to the cover,\nwere on opposite sides of the box. The cover was held\nin place by spring loading and also by a Velcro strap,\nattached\nat one end to the end ring on the box,\nlooped around the entire assembly. To avoid contamination, the LSCRE was transported\nto the Moon in a\nplastic bag inside the lunar module (LM) cabin. The\ntotal weight of the assembled package was 163 g, and\nthe overall dimensions were 22.5 by 6.3 by 1.1 cm.\n\nDEPLOYMENT\nAND RECOVERY\nON THE LUNAR\nSURFACE\nThe LSCRE was deployed by first pulling the slide\ncover off while in the shade of the LM and hanging\nthe cover in place on a hook attached to the side of\nthe LM. The cover remained in the shade, with the\ndetectors\npointed\ntoward space, for 45.5 hr. After\ndeployment\nof the cover, the box portion\nof the\nLSCRE was carried into sunlight and hung on the\nstrut of the LM using the Velcro strap attached to the\nend ring. Deployment\nwas nominal and was completed\nearly in the first period of extravehicular\n\nCOSMIC RAY EXPERIMENT\n\n19-3\n\nTABLE 19-I.-Detectors in the LSCRE\nNumber\n\nDetector\n\nMica\n\nHeavy solar wind and\nlowenergy cosmic ray\nAluminum foil Light solar wind\nPlatinum foil Light solar wind\nFused quartz Low-energy cosmic rays\n(Suprasil2)\nLead phosphate Low-energy cosmic rays\nglass (Lal)\nMica\nHeavy solar wind\n(Sun direction)\nPlatinum foil Light solar wind\nPlatinum foil Light solar wind\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n9\n\nComponent measured\n\nLead phosphati\nglass (Lal)\n10 Phosphate glass\n(GE-1457)\n11 I Lexan\n12 Platinum foil\n~\n\nI\n\nExposed\narea,\ncml\n\n12.2\n5.1\n11.2\n5.4\n1.85\n1.2\n3.8\n8.O\n\nLow-energy cosmic rays\n\n1.76\n\nLow-energy cosmic rays\n\n1.62\n\n1\n\n13\n\nSun half\n\nShade half\n\nO Q\n,\n.\' \'.\n\nb\n\n@- :\nI -:\n\n(Cl\n\nFIGURE 19-l.-The LSCRE.

The exact orientation of the Sun half with\nrespect to the Sun has not yet been precisely\ndetermined. However, the lack of shadowing in the\nphotograph (fig. 19-3), taken at the time the experiment was terminated, shows that the Sun-half detector must have been close to being perpendicular to\nthe Sun line as stated by the LMP at the time of\ninitial deployment. The Sun elevation angle changed\nfrom 13" to 34" during the time the experiment was\ndeployed; the corresponding total change in azimuth\nangle was IO".\nBecause of the possibility of a substantial enhancement in the flux of interplanetary particles, the\nexperiment was terminated at the beginning of\nEVA-3 instead of at the end, as originally planned.\nThe experiment was terminated by the LMP, who\nfirst removed the Sun-half detector and then walked\ninto the shade and mated it with the shade-half\ndetector. The latter was thus never exposed to the\nSun. The LSCRE was then placed in a plastic bag for\ntransport back to Earth. The total exposure time was\n45.5 hr.\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n194\nSun azimuth angle\nat deployment ------\n\n-- Sun azimuth angle\nat termination\nLSCRE (Sun half)\n\nMcdu I arized equipment j\nstowage assembly (MESA)-\'\n\nLSCRE (shade half)\n\nFIGURE 19-2.-Schematic top view of the LM showing\nlocations of the Sun half and the shade half of\ndeployed LSCRE as well as the azimuthal Sun angle at\ntime of deployment and at the time of termination of\nexperiment.\n\nthe\nthe\nthe\nthe\n\nExamination of the detector package after its\nreception in ,the investigators\' laboratory showed that\nthe detector surfaces were in an essentially pristine\ncondition. Less than 5 percent dust cover was\nobserved on the mica and the metallic foils, and it is\nclear that the detectors had not been touched by the\nastronaut in the deployment and termination sequences. The temperature labels indicated that temperatures of the Sun-half detectors had reached 393\nK but stayed below 403 K; the shade-half detectors\nwere always cooler than 316 K. The temperature of\nthe Sun-half detector was somewhat higher than\nanticipated but well below the design limit of 423 K.\n\nSOLAR ACTIVITY I MMEDl ATE LY\nBEFORE AND DURING\nTHE APOLLO 17 MISSION\nDuring the period December 1 1 to 13, 1972, there\nwere two major active regions on the Sun. Region\n496, which reached an apparent optical maximum on\nDecember 12, produced only a few subflares. Region\n500, which emerged on December 10 and 1 1, also\nproduced only minor subflares during the period\nDecember 11 to 13. At 14:55 G.m.t. on December\n13, an eruptive prominence was observed on the\neastern limb. Figure 194 is an optical photograph\nshowing the active solar regions.\n\nFIGURE 19-3.-The Sun half as deployed on the Moon. This\nphotograph is one of a pair of stereoscopic pictures taken\nby the lunar module pilot (LMP) from a distance of 2.13\nm (7 ft) immediately before termination of the experiment (AS17-140-21381 and 21382). Another pair of\nstereoscopic photographs was taken of the shaded portion\n(AS17-140-21383 and 21384).\n\nThe following satellite proton monitor channels\nshowed no significant increase above background\nduring the entire Apollo 17 mission.\nSatellite\n\nChannel energy mnge, MeV\n\naIMPC\nIMP-H\nIMP-I\nPioneer 9\nVela\n\n> 10, > 30, > 60\n> 8, > 25, > 95\n> 10, > 30, > 60\n> 13.9, > 40\n0.88 t o 3.2, 3.2 to 5,1.7 to 12\n\naIMP = Interplanetary Monitoring Platform.\n\nIn contrast, monitors on board the first Applied\nTechnology Satellite (ATS-1) and the lower energy\nchannels on Vela showed significant increases\nthroughout most of December 13, 1972. In particular, the ATS-1 3- to 21-MeV channel showed a slow\nincrease starting at 08:52 G.m.t. on December 13 and\na more pronounced increase at 15:OO G.m.t. on\nDecember 13. During the quiescent period before\n08:52 G.m.t. on December 13, the counting rate was\n0.38 proton/ cm2/sec. During the period from 08:52\nto 15:OO G.m.t. on December 13, the average rate\n\nCOSMIC RAY EXPERIMENT\n\n19-5\n\nN\n\nS\n\nFIGURE 194.-The Sun as observed in hydrogen alpha: The\nphotograph was taken at 09:35 G.m.t., December 13,\n1972, through the optical telescope on Canary Island, one\nof the Solar Particle Alert Network sites.\n\nincreased to 2.0 protons/cm2 /sec. From 15:OO G.m.t.\non December 13 to the time the experiment was\nterminated (22:53 G.m.t.), the average counting rate\nwas 5.3 protons/cm2 /sec. No significant increase\nabove background was observed in the 21- to 70-MeV\nchannel.\nPossibly more significant for this experiment are\nthe results from the low-energy proton channels on\nthe Vela satellite. Starting at approximately 04:OO\nG.m.t. on December 13, the 0.20- to 0.47-MeV\nchannel showed an increase to a new level of =45\nprotons/cm2-sec-sr-MeV from the previous background of ~7 protons/cm2 -sec-sr-MeV. A similar\nincrease from 1.3 to 6 . 5 protons/cm*-sec-sr-MeV\nwas observed in the 0.47- to 0.88-MeV channel. These\nhigher levels were maintained for the rest of the time\nthe experiment was exposed on the Moon and\ncontributed to the decision to terminate it earlier\nthan planned.\nIn the period immediately before the mission, one\nenergetic solar event occurred early on November 28;\nthereafter, solar activity was very low. The November\n28 event was a class MI event from active region 483.\nNo proton enhancement was observed near the Earth,\nbut the Pioneer 6 and 7 spacecraft observed enhanced\n0.6- to 13-MeV proton fluxes on November 29.\n\nFIGURE 19-5.-Surface of mica showing pits of 1-keV/\nnucleon xenon ions. After the surface was bombarded\nwith the ions, the mica was etched for 2 hr in 40 percent\nHF at 303 K. The photograph was taken on Kodak\nhigh-contrast copy film through a Leitz microscope using\nthe Smith interference contrast method in reflected light.\n\nIn summary, the period immediately before and\nduring the mission was one of relatively low, but not\ncompletely negligible, solar activity.\n\nOBSERVATION OF HEAVY SOLAR\nWIND PARTICLES\nWhen mica is irradiated with heavy ions having\nenergies of =l keV/nucleon, subsequent etching\nproduces shallow etch pits (fig. 19-5). Although the\nphysical reasons are not well understood, it is found\nempirically that the diameters of the etch pits depend\non the charge of the bombarding particles. For\nexample, after 2 hr of etching at 303 K in a\n40-percent solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF)-the\nstandard etch treatment for all results reported\nherein-we find that manganese ions produce very\nsmall pits (<1 pm), whereas heavier ions produce\n\n19-6\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nlarger pits as follows: krypton, %2.1 pm; xenon,\n=3.0 pm; and lead, -4.9 pm.\nThis dependence of etch-pit size on the charge of\nthe bombarding particles is the basis for the attempt\nto determine directly the abundance of extremely\nheavy ions in the solar wind. Although the average pit\nsize is a monotonically increasing function of charge,\nany given ion results in a range of pit sizes that is\nquite large. For this reason, the experiment does not\npermit a precise determination of the charge of individual ions; rather, it gives a statistical sampling of\nbroad groups of ions.\nWe have found empirically that the average pit size\nis not strongly dependent on the orientation of the\nbeam with respect to the mica. At shallow incident\nangles to the surface, however, the distribution of pit\nsizes becomes somewhat narrower. The range of the\nangles of incidence of the solar wind is such that no\neffect on the registration properties of heavy ions is\nexpected.\nBecause the registration of very-low-energy ions is\nnot well understood either theoretically or experimentally, the possibility exists that subtle differences\nin the physical state of different mica samples may\naffect the track registration properties. For this\nreason, a complete set of recalibration experiments\nhas been undertaken on the micas that were actually\nsent to the Moon. These calibrations are not yet\ncomplete; for this reason, the results reported here\nare mostly qualitative.\nThe results are also preliminary because only the\ncrudest and quickest method of observation has been\nused. In practice, three methods can be used:\ninterference contrast optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron\nmicroscopy. After a 2-hr etch, producing wide pits (as\nmuch as 6 pm in diameter), the pits are easily\nobserved by interference contrast optical microscopy.\nIn this technique, the surface is first silvered and then\nobserved either in a Zeiss microscope using the\nNomarski interference system or in a Leitz microscope using the Smith interference system. In our\nexperience, the two systems seem to be roughly\nequivalent, with the former giving somewhat higher\nresolution and the latter somewhat better contrast.\nThese differences, however, may have resulted from\nimperfect alinement of either or both of the systems.\nThe optical microscope is capable of giving relatively quick results, but the large pit sizes involved\nhave two consequences. When the density of tracks is\n\nlarge (as is the case here), the pits overlap and the\noccasional large pits tend to be obscured. In principle,\nobservation of surface replicas of briefly etched\nsample4 using a transmission electron microscope\nshould give more detailed measurements than those\nreported herein. Scanning electron inicroscopy of\nlightly etched surfaces is possible in principle, but we\nhave not been able to get enough contrast in the\nimages to make this technique practicable.\nIn figures 19-6 to 19-9, it is $own that heavy solar\nwind ions are registering in the mica as expected.\nFigure 19-6 shows a sample of mica exposed on the\nSun half that has been etched for 2 hr in a 40-percent\nHF bath at 303 K. The photograph was obtained\nusing the Smith interference system. The surface is\nclearly covered with a background of small, shallow\npits, present in such abundance as to be unresolvable.\nThe estimated concentration of solar wind ion atoms\nwas 1.2 X lo9 atoms/cm2; laboratory irradiations\nwith 1 X lo9 atoms/cm2 manganese ions of 1\nkeV/nucleon produce a similar background at the\nsame etch time. A region of the Sunexposed mica\n\n10 prn\n\nFIGURE 19-6.-Mica surface of LSCRE exposed to sunlight\nduring 45.5 hr on the Moon. Etching and microphotography conditions were the same as those for figure 19-5.\n\nCOSMIC RAY EXPERIMENT\n\nthat was covered with a 0.5-mm-thick stainless steel\nstrap is shown in figure 19-7. Clearly, the bulk of the\nparticles causing the shallow background have been\nstopped by the strap. In figure 19-8, a region of the\nSun-half mica that was covered with -150 nm of\nsilver is shown. Again, a striking difference is observed in the background of very shallow pits. Finally, in figure 19-9, an etched sample of the shaded\nmica is shown. The extensive background of shallow\npits is again missing.\nAlthough the extensive shallow pit background is\nmissing in those areas of mica not exposed directly to\nthe Sun, all areas of both the shade-half and Sun-half\nmicas contain a considerable density of deep pits\ncorresponding to higher energy particles. Figure\n19-10 is a scanning electron microscope photograph\nof one such deep pit. Because of the relatively\nquiescent behavior of the Sun during the Apollo 17\nmission, these higher energy particles were not\nexpected. They are discussed separately in the section\nentitled \xe2\x80\x9cEnergetic Solar Particles.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe photographs (figs. 19-5 to 19-9) illustrate\n\n1\n10 urn\n\nFIGURE 19-7.-Mica surface from the sunlit portion of the\nLSCRE.

In addition to the bright\n(deep) pits, the covered and shaded portions of the\nmica contain a low background of shallow, broad\npits. These pits were probably produced by highenergy ions similar to those producing the bright pits,\nbut of lower mass. Particles such as 100-keV/nucleon\noxygen are capable of producing pits (ref. 19-6)\ncaused by occasional, damage-producing, close nuclear encounters with the near-surface atoms of the\nmica detectors. These pits thus constitute a background that must be subtracted to obtain information\nabout extremely heavy solar wind ions.\nClose examination of figures 19-7 t o 19-9 further\nshows that the mica that was covered with 150 nm of\nsilver has a higher background of very small, shallow\npits than either the mica that was exposed in the\nshade or the Sun-half mica that was covered with the\nmetal strap. Contrary to expectations, some solar\n\n1\n\n10 prn\n\nFIGURE 19-8.-Mica surface from the sunlit portion that was\ncovered with 150 nm of silver during exposure.

Additional measurements on the\nmica regions covered with 50 to 100 nm of silver\nshould clarify this point.\nFor this preliminary analysis, the periodic table\nabove charge 2 = 30 has been divided into three\nbroad groupings of elements. The first, consisting of\ncharges from 30 to 40 (group I), is much more\nabundant than the others, which include 2 = 40 to 2\n= 60 (group 11) and the group of charges from 60 to\n92 (group 111). (Most of group 111 is made up of\nelements of 2 = 78 and Z = 82.) The expected pit\ndensities in various size ranges from these three\ngroups are summarized in table 19-11. The contribution of the group I elements to the expected\ndensity of pits may be overestimated by as much as a\nfactor of 3 because an efficiency of pit registration of\nunity in this range has been assumed; in reality, the\nefficiency may be as low as 0.3. The registration\nefficiency of the group I1 elements is at least 50\n\nFIGURE 19-10.-0ne of the deep pits produced by energetic\nheavy particles as seen on the Sun-half mica. The\nphotograph was taken in a scanning electron microscope.\nSimilar tracks from energetic particles are seen in the mica\nn\nexposed i shade (fig. 19-9).\n\npercent; of the group 111 elements, it is essentially\n100 percent.\nAlso shown in table 19-11 are the experimental\nresults obtained to date for pits >2 pm in diameter.\nThe results are not in good agreement with the\ncalculated values. In particular, the experimental\nvalues for large pits are much lower than expected.\nTo fit the predicted values, eight pits > 4 p m in\ndiameter and four pits >5 pm in diameter should\nhave been seen in the area scanned; none, in fact,\nwere observed.\nTaken at face value, this deficiency would imply a\ndepletion of both group I1 and group 111 elements in\nthe solar wind. In view of existing measurements of\nxenon abundances in both lunar samples and meteorites, a depletion of group I1 elements seems most\nunlikely. A more likely explanation is that the larger\nshallow pits have been obscured by the large background of small, iron-group pits developed by the\nlong etching times used in this first-scan look. More\ndetailed measurements using shorter etching times are\nin progress. If the apparent depletion is still found in\nZhese experiments, then the effects of other factors,\n\nCOSMIC\nRAYEXPERIMENT\nTABLE\n\n19-II.-P/t\n\nDensity\n\nTrack\nPit\n\nDistribution\n\ndensity,\n\ntracks\n\ntcm\n\n2\n\nMze,\nCalculated\n\n_rn\n\ncontribution\n\na of group-Total\n\nb1\n1to2\n2to 3\n3to4\n4to 5\n5 to6\n6to7\n\n2.1\n2.25\n5.6\n5.8\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\no\n0\n\ncH\n\nlOs\nlO s\nlO 4\nlO 3\n\n9 X 10 s\n0.15 X l0 s\n1.2 X 104\n5.9 X l0 s\n1.6 X l0 s\n0\n\nabased on solar abundances.\nbAtomic numbers 30 to 40.\nprincipally\nthe potential\nfading of tracks by solar\nultraviolet irradiation, will have to be pursued before\nany final conclusions can be reached.\n\nENERGETIC\n\n19-9\n\nSOLAR\n\nPARTICLES\n\nAs previously\nnoted,\nboth the shade-half\nand\nSun-half mica detectors\nhad numerous\nbright pits\ncorresponding\nto longer tracks. Scanning by normal\ntransmission\noptical microscopy,\nwhere the shallow\npits are not observable, gave consistent track densities\nof 6.4 -+ 0.6 X 103 tracks/cm 2 for a shade-half sample\nand 5.8 + 0.6 X 10 a tracks/cm _ for a Sun-half\nsample. The high-energy\nparticles therefore are distributed isotropically\nin space and appear to have no\nrelationship\nto the solar wind. From comparison with\nscanning electron\nmicroscope\ndata, it is estimated\nthat the track densities obtained by optical microscopy correspond to pits _,0.5/am in depth.\nAlthough much higher in energy than the solar\nwind, the particles being detected have rather modest\nenergies in comparison with many solar flare particles\nor galactic cosmic rays. Only four tracks corresponding to iron ions of >_1 MeV/nucleon\nwere found in a\nscan of a 0.5-cm 2 area.\nThe distribution\nof track densities\ncompared\nto\nenergy, assuming registration\nof iron ions only, is\nshown in figure 19-11. Two curves are shown: in one,\nthe measured\ntrack length\nhas been taken as a\nmeasure of the total range of the iron ions; in the\nother, it is assumed that iron ions do not register in\nthe last 1.7/am of their range.

The long etching times (chosen for\nexamination\nof shallow\npits) made it difficult\nto\nmeasure lengths below _.5/am with precision, and the\nlower energy points are probably somewhat\nunderestimated.\nAdditional\nmeasurements\nare in progress\nusing a transmission\nelectron microscope\non replicas\nfrom the mica. Until these measurements\nhave been\nmade and final calibration\ndata on the range deficit\nare obtained,\nthe curves in figure 19-11 should be\nconsidered as lower limits on the fluxes of particles in\nthis energy range.\nThe assumption\nthat only iron ions are responsible\nfor the tracks is not strictly correct because ions as\nlight as neon can produce tracks toward the end of\ntheir range. As previously\nnoted, even low-energy\noxygen ions can give observable,\nshallow pits.

As outlined in the\nsection entitled "Solar Activity Immediately\nBefore\nand During the Apollo 17 Mission," although the Sun\nwas generally quiescent, some activity was observed.\nParticle counting rates also rose considerably\nabove\nbackground\nat low energies early on the morning of\nDecember\n13, 1972. Possibly, the particles observed\n\nassociated\n\nwith this rather\n\nmodest\n\nsolar\n\nactivity. They could also represent particles stored in\nthe interplanetary\nregions from earlier solar emissions. Here again, however,\nthe solar activity was\nrather modest immediately\nbefore the mission. The\npossibility that the Sun emits a more or less continuous flux of such low-energy particles, independent\nof\nany visible solar activity, cannot be ruled out. Testing\nthis point will require additional\nmeasurements\nof\nextremely\nlow energy particles outside the magnetosphere.\nLunar sample investigators\nhave normally\nattributed fossil track observations\nof low-energy particles\nto the influence\nof solar flares. The present result\nconfirms\nthis interpretation.\nThe quiet-time\nfluxes\nmeasured\nin this experiment,\nalthough\nhigher than\nexpected, are simply too low to account for the lunar\nobservations.\nIn this connection,\nit should be noted\nthat the rather modest\nflare observed\nduring the\nApollo 16 mission contributed\n200 times as many\ntrack-producing\nparticles as were observed\nin this\nexperiment.\n\nLIMITS\n\nON THE RADON\nAT THE APOLLO\n\nATMOSPHERE\n17 SITE\n\nRecoiling\natoms from alpha-particle\ndecay processes have kinetic energies similar to those in the\nsolar wind. It was, in fact, the observation\nof fossil\nalpha-particle\nrecoil tracks in terrestrial\nmicas (ref.\n19-8) that originally led to the suggestion that mica\ncould be used as a heavy solar wind monitor. Two\nimportant\nsources of alpha-particle\nrecoil tracks are\nradon-222 (222Rn) atoms in the lunar atmosphere\nand\ncorresponding\npolonium-210\n(2_\xc2\xb0Po)\natoms\nthat\nshould be deposited on the surface from prior 222Rn\ndecay.\nAssuming that recoils of polonium atoms from the\nsurface\nregister\nwith unity efficiency,\nthe total\nnumber\nof alpha.particle\nrecoil tracks per square\ncentimeter\nper second should be approximately\nthe\nsame as the number of alpha particles per square\ncentimeter\nper second from 222Rn decay measured in\na detector the surface of which is normal to the lunar\nsurface. In a preliminary\nscan of the shaded mica,\nonly one pit >5/am in diameter was\nof 2.8 \xc3\x97 10 -4 cm 2.

The initial\nresults indicate a depletion\nof very-heavy solar wind\nions.

Characteristically, the fluxes of these galactic particles have been\nobserved to decrease with decreasing energy in the\nrange from a few hundred MeVIamu to the lowest\nenergies previously measured (a MeV/amu for\n40\nheavy nuclei) (ref. 19-2). In contrast, solar flare\nparticles are found, generally, to decrease in abundance with increasing energy (ref. 19-11) and, specifically, for heavy nuclei in the same energy range as\nthat considered in this part (refs. 19-2 to 19-5).

In support\nof this idea, a plot of the\nnumber of flares as a function of their areas shows an\nincreasingly\ngreater\nnumber\nof small flares (ref.\n19-18).\nAs an example of the abundance\nof small flares,\nduring the period December\n10 to 13, 1972 (the\nactual Apollo 17 experiment\noccurred in the period\nDecember 11 to 13), the following were observed: 11\nsunspot groups; 52 flares of subflare category (on an\nS, 1, 2, 3, 4 level of classification\nof the Sun area\ninvolved, with faint (F), normal (N), and brilliant (B)\nassociated with each level); one flare of importance\n1F; and three radio bursts (ref. 19-17).\nBecause the GE-1457 glass detector\nwas exposed\nfacing away from the Sun, the inferred solar origin of\nthe particles implies that, farther out in the solar\nsystem than the Earth-Moon\ndistance,\nmagnetic irregularities\nexist that effectively enable the detector\nto record heavy ions even though it faces away from\nthe Sun. It is important\nto note that the two lead\nphosphate (Lal) glass detectors showed a difference in\ntrack densities, namely a larger track density in the\nSun-exposed\nportion by a factor of 2. This difference\nmakes clear the solar origin for the particles.\nIt is also of interest\nto consider\nthe relative\nabundance\nof heavy elements\nduring the period of\nthis experiment.\nFrom the satellite proton flux and\nthe heavy-element\nflux observed by the investigators,\n\nPART\nTHE\n\nNATURE\nWITH\n\n19-15\n\na value of the ratio of protons\nto heavy\n_10 000 at 0.3 MeV/amu and a limit of<\n\nnuclei of\n10 000 at\n\n1 MeV/amu can be derived. By comparison,\nvalues of\n1200 and 12 000, respectively,\nwere observed during\nthe April 17, 1972, flare (ref. 19-4). In short, the\nheavy-element\nenrichment\nrelative\nto protons\nobserved in a flare is seen here also.\n\nSUMMARY\nGlass track detectors were exposed to cosmic rays\non the Moon from December\n11 to 13, 1972, during\na period of relatively quiet Sun activity as inferred\nfrom satellite\nproton\ncounters.\nFrom 80 to 400\nkeV/amu,\nthe differential\nflux of heavy cosmic ray\nnuclei decreases roughly as E--2; this result together\nwith the greater flux from the solar than the antisolar\ndirection\n\nidentify\n\nthese nuclei as solar in origin.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank R.

A major source of\ninterference\nin the gamma ray spectral measurements\nmay be attributable\nto the proton-induced\nactivity in\nthe scintillation\ndetectors. The sources of this activity\nduring space flight are the primary and secondary\ncosmic rays and, in addition, the trapped-proton\nflux\nwhen in near-Earth\norbit. A number of individuals\n\nused in this experiment\n(ref. 20-6). The Apollo 17\nassembly did not include\nthe photomultiplier,\nthe\nproton\nanticoincidence\nmantle,\nand the thermal\nshield. The detector was a 7- by 7-cm right-cylindrical\ncrystal. A glass plate was optically\nsealed to the\ncrystal.

Before splashdown,\nthe control (unactivated)\ncrystal was optically sealed\nto a photomultiplier\ntube and the background\nwas\ndetermined in the steel shield. The same photomultiplier tube was used to count the flight and control\ncrystal assemblies. After 30 hr of counting\non board\nthe recovery ship, the detector was flown back to the\nORNL where measurements\nwere continued.\nThis\n\ninduced activity were conducted\nfor a 30-hr period.\nThe crystal was then returned\nto the Oak Ridge\nNational\nLaboratory\n(ORNL),\nwhere the measurements were continued in a low-level counting facility.\n\no\n\noxide was used as the optical\ncrystal assembly.\nThis type of\nhermetic\nsealing of the crystal\na simple procedure\nfor optically\nassembly to a photomultiplier\nThe crystal and reflector\nwere\n\nenclosed in a steel jacket.

Both halves\ncan be operated\nso as to require the occurrence\nof\ncoincident\nevents in both halves before an event is\nanalyzed and recorded (coincidence\nspectra), or both\nhalves can be operated\nwithout\nthe coincidence\nrequirement\nso that events can be analyzed\nand\nrecorded independently\n(singles spectra).\nPRELIMI\n\nNARY\n\nRESULTS\n\nTo date, it has been possible to obtain qualitative\nidentification\nof the following\nnuclear\nspecies:\nsodium-24 (24Na), _ 15 hr;iodine-123\n(123I), _ 13.2\nhr; iodine-124 (124I), _4.8\ndays; iodine-125\n(12si),\n60.1 days; iodine-126 (126I), _ 13 days; xenon-127\n(127Xe), _36.4\ndays; sodium-22\n(22Na), _2.6\nyr;\nand iodine-128\n(12si),\n_25\nmin. After\nsuitable\ncalibrations,\nquantitative\nconcentrations\nof these\nradionuclides\nwill be obtained.\nThe present results\nindicate\nthat the induced\nactivity\nobserved\nafter\nrecovery can be attributed\nmainly to species with half\nlives of approximately\n12 hr and longer. Decay\nproducts with shorter half lives do not make a large\ncontribution\nto the postrecovery\nintegral count rate.\nThis is not to imply that there are no short half-life\ncomponents.\nIn fact, an apparent\nline at approximately 0.44 MeV may be characteristic\nof _ I. There\nare a few more regions with relatively short half lives\n(on the order of tens of minutes) that have not yet\nbeen identified.\nThe pulse-height\nspectrum\nobtained\nduring the\nfirst 1.5 hr of counting after recovery is shown in\nfigure 20-1. The spectrum\nhas been corrected\nfor\nbackground\nby subtracting\nthe measurements\nobtained with the control crystal. Peak energies for the\nnuclides presently\nidentified\nare indicated in figure\n20-1. The peak positions for 123I, _24I, 126I, and naI\nare displaced by _ 27 keV due to X-ray emission and\nabsorption after electron capture.\nMeasurements\nof the flight and control crystals\nperformed at the low-level counting laboratory at the\nORNL before flight indicated that the potassium (K)\nand thorium (Th) content of the flight crystal was\nslightly higher than that for the conUol crystal. Thus,\nsome indication of these elements would be expected\n\nSCIENCE\nafter\n\nREPORT\n\nbackground\n\nsubtraction.\n\nThis indication\n\ncan be\n\nseen in the potassium-40\n(4\xc2\xb0K) and Th identification\nin figure 20-1. The energy identifications\nfor 124I,\n126I,\nand 24Na indicated\nin figure 20-1 have been\nverified\nby measurements\nmade with the Ge(Li)\ndetector\nand in the low-level counting system. Both\nenergy and half-life information\nhas been used to\ndetermine\nthe presence of these nuclear species. The\n1231 and 12aI species were identified\nby use of the\nspectra obtained\non board the recovery\nship from\nboth energy and half-life determinations.\nThe 22Na\nspecies has been tentatively\nidentified on the basis of\na preliminary\nanalysis of the data obtained\nby the\ncoincidence\nmeasurements\nin the low-level counting\nfacility. The presence of nTXe has been determined\nby the identification\nof energy lines at 0.172, 0.203,\nand 0.375 MeV using the Ge(Li) detector.\nThe work\nwill be continued\nto obtain quantitative\nresults and\npossibly to identify more nuclear species that have\nnot been obvious from these early analyses.\nFigure 20-2 is a pulse-height spectrum obtained by\nusing the activated crystal mounted on a photomultiplier and counted in a lead shield at the ORNL. The\ncounting\ntook place 1.5 months\nafter splashdown,\nand the counting\ntime was 60 000 sec. The background count is also shown. The gain of the spectrometer was adjusted to observe the very-low-energy\nportion of the gamma ray pulse-height spectrum. The\ncharacteristic\ndecay spectrum of the 12s I species can\nbe easily seen.\nDISCUSSION\nThe cosmic-ray-induced\ncrystal activation\nis of\nconsiderable\nconsequence\nin the analysis\nof the\nApollo 15 and 16 gamma ray spectra obtained during\ntransearth\ncoast. In determining\nthe magnitude\nand\ndifferential\nenergy spectrum of the so-called diffuse\ngamma ray spectrum\nin the 0.3 to 30-MeV region,\none of the major sources of interference\ncan be\nattributed\nto the crystal activation.\nThus, to make\nproper background\ncorrections,\nboth the magnitude\nand the spectral\ndistribution\nof the cosmic-rayinduced activity had to be determined.\nSome theoretical and experimental\nwork had been done to\npredict the magnitude\nof this effect (refs. 20-4 and\n20-5), but the work on the Apollo 15 diffuse gamma\nray measurements\n(ref. 20-2) indicated\nthat these\npredictions\nwere too high. To better determine\nthe\nextent of this effect, the Apollo 17 experiment\nwas\nperformed.\n\nGAMMA\n100\n\nRAY\n\nSPECTROMETER\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\n20-3\n\nQ.......159MeV. 1231\n0\n4\n._0.44 MeV, 1281\n0:389 MeV, 12 I //"._--0.51\nMeV (many sources)\n\nO0\n\no\n\n/"_.://_ 0.603 MeV. 1261\n....\n/"\'"\'"\';\n...... 0.666 MeV, 1241\n0.723 MeV, 1231\n\n10\n\n/1.27\n\nMeV,22 Na(possibly)\n\n,,\'" ,1.36 MeV, 24Na (possibly)\n\n,--2.62 MeV (possibly),thorium line\npossibly excessin activatedcrystal\n\n.--0.754 MeV. 126) ,,,,_,,,\'_ 1.46 MeV. 4\xc2\xb0K. possible\n/\n\n/\n\ni tS\n\nexcesspotassium (K)\ni n activated crystal\n.... 1.69 MeV,\n\n.15 MeV.24Na\n\n124j\n!\n\nI\ni\n\n\'\n\nl\n\n#\n\nl\n0\n\n.1\n\nCalculatedspallationcontinuum\n(ref. 20-5)\nApollol? data\n\n08\n\nSpallationcontinuum estimated\nfromApollo15 results\n\noo\no\n\nI\n.4\n\n.01\n\nI\n.6\n\nI\n.8\n\nI\nt.O\n\nI\n1.2\n\nI\n1.4\n\nI\n1.6\n\nI\nI\nI\n1.8\n2.0\n2.2\nEnergy.

Cour-Palais a\n\nThe purposes of the Apollo window meteoroid\nexperiment\nwere to use the Apollo command module\n(CM) heat shield window\nsurfaces to obtain additional information\nabout the flux of meteoroids with\n\ndensity\n\nmasses of 10 -7 g and less, to examine the residue and\nthe morphology\nof the craters produced\nby these\nmeteoroids\nto obtain information\nregarding the dynamic and physical properties\nof the meteoroids,\nand\nto discover possible correlations\nwith the lunar-rockcrater studies.\n\nfor meteoroid impacts; thus far, 10 impacts have been\nobserved. The flux represented\nby the number of\nimpacts and the area-time of exposure by the Apollo\nwindows is compatible\nwith the flux estimates obtained\nfrom\nthe\nresults\nof penetration\nsensors\nmounted on the Pegasus 1, 2, and 3 satellites, by the\nExplorer 16 and 23 satellites, and by the Surveyor III\nshroud.\n\nIn addition\nto information\nregarding meteoroid\nflux, this experiment\ncould yield information\non the\nmass density and, possibly,\non the composition\nof\nmeteoroids.\nTo determine\nthe mass density would\nrequire the assumption\nthat the velocity distribution\nas determined\nfrom optical and radar observations\nof\nmuch larger meteoroids\nis applicable\nto the smaller\nmeteoroids.\n\nfrom\n\nobservations\n\nof\n\nTHEORY\n\nMeteoroids\nare solid particles\nmoving in interplanetary space that originate from both cometary\nand asteroidal sources. They are classified as sporadics\nwhen the orbits are random and as streams when\nmany have nearly identical orbits. A meteor is the\nlight phenomenon\nassociated with the interaction of a\nmeteoroid\nwith the atmosphere\nof the Earth. The\nportion that survives interaction with the atmosphere\nand is found\non the surface of the Earth is a\nmeteorite.\nIt is generally accepted\nthat most meteorites are of asteroidal origin (ref. 21-1) and that the\ntypical\nmeteoroid\noriginates\nfrom\na cometary\nnucleus, is frangible,\nand does not reach the surface\nof the Earth. Thus, very little is known about the\ncomposition\nand the mass density of meteoroids,\nwhereas meteorites have been collected and examined\n\nWhen the effects of entry heating, subsequent\nimmersion in salt water, and all the other contamifor, the composition\nof\nthe crater or in the\n\nshock-fused\nglass will be determined\nby the use of a\nscanning electron\nmicroscope\n(SEM) nondispersive\nX-ray detector.\nThe significance\nof the use of this\ndetector\nis that compositions\nand mass densities\nobtained\nin space can be compared\nwith those\nobtained\nfrom the lunar rock samples without\nthe\nlong-term\nexposure\nto the environmental\neffects of\nspace.

Controversy\nexists as to\nwhether the typical meteoroid\nis a low-density (1.0\ng]cm 3 or less) dust or ice ball or a stony object that\nfroths during atmospheric\nentry and breaks off in\nchunks. If it is the latter, the mass density could be\n2.5 to 3.0 g/cm 3. The typical meteoroid\nhas been\ndescribed\n(ref. 21-3) as a conglomerate\nof dust\nparticles bound together by frozen gases or "ices";\nanother author (ref. 21-4) postulates that meLeoroids\nare "dust balls."

All chips,\nscratches, and other features that could be confused\nwith meteoroid-impact\ncraters\nwere noted\non a\nsurface map. As a result of the stringent\nquality\ncontrol and optical requirements,\nthe windows have\nbeen generally free of such defects, and this mapping\npractice has been discontinued.\nThe windows were\nreceived\nwith a fairly thick\ncoating\nof surface\ncontamination\nthat was removed before the optical\nscan by washing with water and isopropyl alcohol.\nThe windows were next scanned at 20\xc3\x97 magnification by two different\nobservers,\nand suspected\nimpact craters were marked on a map. From experience with hypervelocity\nimpacts in fused silica, it was\npossible to separate\nthe meteoroid\nimpacts\nfrom\nother surface effects.\nEvery suspected meteoroid\ncrater was subjected to\nthe following procedure.\n1.

The window section was prepared\nfor residue\nanalysis with the SEM nondispersive\nX-ray detector\nby applying a thin carbon coating.\n5. Residue analysis was performed,\nand all constituents were recorded.\n6. The same window section was cleaned, and a\nthin gold coating was applied for normal, tilt, and\n\nThe Apollo 17 windows were received with the\nouter surfaces contaminated\nwith the hard deposit\nthat has been present on all the Apollo windows\nexamined.\nThe results\nof a chemical\nanalysis of\nsamples taken from the Apollo 9 windows and the\npossible sources\nof the contaminants\nhave been\npreviously discussed (ref. 21-13) and are assumed to\nbe typical of all the other spacecraft.\nA preliminary\nscan of the Apollo 17 hatch and\nside window outer surfaces at 2\xc3\x97, sufficient to detect\na crater 80 to 100 /am in diameter,\nrevealed no\nmeteoroid impacts. The crater reportedly\nseen by the\ncrew during the mission on hatch window number 3\nwas actually a 450-/am-diameter\nbubble in the glass\njust beneath the surface. As a result of the scan, an\neven larger bubble\n(approximately\n750 /am) was\nobserved\nin window\nnumber\n1. The Apollo\n17\nwindows examined\nhad numerous\nbubbles ranging\nfrom the large ones previously mentioned to those 50\n/am in diameter\nbut typically\n100 to 200 /am in\ndiameter.\nApproximately\n3.5 m2 of Apollo heat shield\nwindows have been optically scanned, and 10 meteoroid impacts have been identified, with spall diameters\nranging from 25 to 445 /am (ref. 21-13).

This is due to the previously\nmentioned ejection of the pit lips during spallation and a\nresulting larger pit diameter as may be observed in\nfigure 21-3(a). It is also apparent\nthat spallation\nbegins earlier for the silicon projectiles than for the\niron projectiles, except in one case. This exception is\nfor a very small iron projectile\nwith a resulting\nlow-impact\nenergy. The aluminum\nprojectile\n(p =\n2.78 g]cm a) shown in table 21-1I and in figure\n21-3(b) is from reference 21-15; it is included because\nthe tests with the lanthanum\nhexaboride\nprojectiles\n(p = 2.6 g/cm a) were not very conclusive and a point\nfor a projectile\nwith a similar mass density was\nneeded.\n\nDi =diameterofthe inner spall zone\n(b)\n\nAs the Apollo craters observed had remelted pits\nand well-defined outer spall zones, the equation used\nto obtain the impacting meteoroid mass was\n0.5\n\n0.31\n\nDO = 2.8d m \xc3\x97 om\n\n\xc3\x97 Em\n\n(21-1)\n\nOo\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nDi\n\n"1\n\nDO"diameter of the outer spall zone\n(c)\nFIGURE 21-2.-Cratering regimes.

Melting\nof the glass began at an initial impact pressure of\napproximately\n0.2 Mbar, and lips were well formed\nby 0.25 Mbar for all the test projectiles used. In some\nof the tests, a second spallation zone was observed\napproximately\nconcentric\nwith and at a shallower\nslope than the inner zone. Also present were intermediate regimes, such as pits with radial and concentric cracks and inner spalls with radial cracks\nextending beyond their peripheries.\nThe data from table 21-II are shown in figure\n21-3(a) and 21-3(b), in which parametric\nfunctions\ninvolving the diameters of the pit and inner and outer\nspalls and the projectile density are plotted against\nthe proiectile energy. All three crater regimes can be\nrepresented\nwithin limits by the expression\nshown\non each graph. If the two graphs are viewed together,\nit is apparent\nin nearly\nevery case that the pit\nrelationship\ndoes not hold when the spaUation rela-\n\nwhere D O is the crater outer\nspaU diameter\nin\ncentimeters;\nPm is the meteoroid\nmass density, 2\ng/cma; E m is the meteoroid\nenergy in ergs; and drn is\nthe meteoroid\ndiameter\nin centimeters.\nAn average\nmeteoroid\nvelocity\nof 20 km/sec\nis assumed\nto\ncomplete the determination\nof meteoroid masses.\nThe Apollo 14 core examinations\nwere able to\nresolve down to 0.2-/am-diameter\npits if there were\nany. Because\nthe impact\ntests showed\nthat pits\napproximately\n2/am in diameter\nand smaller in the\nApollo window\nmaterial\ndid not have concentric\nspalls, it may be assumed that the pit equation from\nfigure 21-3(a) is appropriate\nto determine the limiting\nmeteoroid mass for the core. Thus\n-0.18\n\nDp = 1.8p m\n\n0.33\n\n\xc3\x97 Em\n\n(21-2)\n\nwhere Dp is the pit diameter\nin micrometers.\nThe\n5-#m pits observed\nin the cores were related to\nmeteoroid mass by the equation\n0.31\n\n0.5\n\nDi = 1.22d m \xc3\x97 om\n\nx Em\n\n(21-3)\n\nwhere\nD i is the crater inner spall diameter\nin\ncentimeters,\nbecause they represent an intermediate\ncratering regime.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results\nare shown\n\nof the mass and flux\n\nin figure 21-4 compared\n\ndeterminations\n\nwith the meteor-\n\nAPOLLO\nWINDOWETEOROID\nM\nEXPERIMENT\noid flux model\n\nof reference\n\n21-14 and the Pioneer 8\n\nand 9 satellite data for the front film grid and time of\nflight detectors\n(ref. 21-16). In addition to the results\nof the optical scan given\nincludes\nthe data\nfrom\n\nin table 21-1, figure 21-4\nthe SEM scans of the\n\n1.7-cm-diameter\ncore taken from the Apollo\n14\nwindow. Thus, the flux relative to the five craters of\n5/am in diameter and larger is shown at a mass value\nof 10 -n\'42 g. In addition, the point at 10 -12 g is the\n95-percent\nupper-limit flux for the mass equivalent of\nthe detection\nthreshold\nat which no craters were\nobserved.\nThis latest mass calibration\nof the craters found\non the Apollo windows,\nbased\nshown, differs from that reported\nby no more than a factor\nfor which the detectable\n\non the equations\nin reference 21-13\n\nof 3, except for Apollo 15\ncrater threshold\nwas also\n\ndecreased. The previous masses were based on average\nspall-to-meteoroid-diameter\nratios of 10, 15, and 25\nfor spall ranges of < 50/am, 50 to 100/am, and > 100\n/zm, respectively.\nFurther\nanalysis of the test data\ncould result in changes; however,\nthe mass levels\nshown are considered to be reasonably accurate.\nAlthough\nstatistically\npoor, the Apollo window\ndata substantiate\nthe curve of reference 21-14, which\nrepresents\nthe mean near-Earth\nflux, except\nfor\nApollo 7 and 13. The Apollo 7 spacecraft\nwas in\nEarth orbit and its windows\nobtained\nthe most\nimpacts (five); therefore,\nthe result is more valid than\nthe others. The Apollo 13 crater was the largest ever\nobtained on a window in the shortest exposure of any\nof the spacecraft. The Pioneer 8 and 9 results show an\nincrease of 25 times the flux level predicted by the\nreferenced\nmodel at 10 -12 g, and the Apollo 14\n\n2-/am-diameter\n\nupper\n\nlimit\n\nat the\n\nment, represent a better estimate of the small particle\nenvironment than that shown in reference 21-14. This\nfact would be consistent with the higher fluxes shown\nin reference 21-17 for the lunar-rock-crater\ndistributions and with the revised estimate of the Explorer\nXXIII and Pegasus detectors\nshown in figure 6 of\nreference 21-18 in comparison\nwith the same NASA\ndesign curve of reference 21-14.

The rate of transmitter\nfiring\nis sufficiently high to make the profiling essentially\ncontinuous. In addition to acquiring the global profile\nfor selenodesy studies, detailed profiles were acquired\nthat may be used to address local selenomorphologi-\n\ngeological\nstructure,\n(2) surface profding to determine lunar topographic\nvariations,\n(3) surface imaging, and (4) measuring galactic electromagnetic\nradiation in the lunar environment.\nThe ALSE was a\nthree-frequency,\noperated\nfrom\nmission.\n\nwide-band,\nlunar orbit\n\nis the dielectric constant\nof the typical dielectric-\n\ncoherent\nradar system\nduring the Apollo\n17\n\nThe concept of radar sounding is quite analogous\nto active seismic profiling; that is, a continuous series\nof short\npulses\nof (electromagnetic)\nenergy are\npropagated\ntoward the Moon and are reflected from\nthe lunar\nsurface\nand from subsurface\ngeologic\ninterfaces.\nThe energy reflected\nfrom the Moon is\ncontinuously\nrecorded\nas the command\nand service\nmodule\n(CSM) moves in lunar orbit, and thus a\nprofile of surface and subsurface structure\nis assem-\n\ncal problems.\nIn the active sounding\nmode,\nthe quality\nof\nimagery is dependent,\nfor a given frequency,\non the\ndiffuse backscattering\nproperties of the lunar surface.\nOne record of the surface backscattered\nenergy is\ncompiled from each transmitted\npulse reflected from\nthe Moon. A sequence of records then comprises a\ntwo-dimensional\ndata array necessary to create an\nimage. The image is typically bounded on one side by\nthe spacecraft-nadir\ntopographic\nprofile,\nand the\ncombination\nof profile and image is very useful for\nsurface geologic interpretation.\nThe ALSE system was operated in three frequency\nranges: 5 MHz (HF-1), 15 MHz (H-2), and 150 MHz\n(VHF). The HF-1 system is capable of the deepest\n\nbled. The capability\nto map the lunar interior is\ndependent\non a low-electrical-loss\nsubsurface;\nthat\nis, the attenuation\nof the signal must not preclude a\nsignificant depth of exploration.\nPremission estimates\nof path loss, based on measurements\nfrom returned\nlunar samples, indicated a maximum depth of exploration\nof approximately\n1 km.

A dispersed\npulse is used for two basic reasons: (I) the recording\nmedium (film) has a relatively low dynamic range and\nthe dispersion of energy is necessary to preserve the\nrather large dynamic range inherent in the data and\nrequired in the experiment;\nand (2) pulse compression increases the effective peak power of the pulse\nand hence the dynamic range of the data by the\n\ntime-bandwidth\nfactor,\nthus negating\na need for\nlarge-peak-power\ntransmitters.\nFigure 22-3 shows an idealized version of a linear\nFM sweep pulse (fig. 22-3(a)) and the same pulse\nupon compression\n(fig. 22-3(b)).\nOne reason for\nchoosing the linear FM sweep pulse is that during\noptical processing of the data, only simple optics are\nrequired for the compression\nstep. One disadvantage\nof the dispersed energy scheme is the generation of\nside lobes upon compression\nas shown in figure\n22-3(b). The side lobes tend to mask weak subsurface\nevents. In practice, the frequency\nspectrum of the\nchirp signal is weighted to produce a decrease in the\nside lobes, at the expense of resolution.\nAdditionally,\nany phase errors in the ALSE system tend to raise\nside-lobe levels. However, it is possible to compensate\nfor systematic\nphase errors during digital processing\nand, hence, to preserve the low side lobes of the\nwaveform.\nDoppler\nTo this\nsingle pulse\nthe picture,\n\npoint,\n\nthe\n\nHistory\n\ndiscussion\n\nhas centered\n\non a\n\nof electromagnetic\nenergy.

As the spacecraft\ntraverses a target, the Doppler history of the target is\nrecorded in the azimuth direction. Thus, the concept\nof the two-dimensional\nfrequency\nspectrum\nof a\ntarget is realized (fig. 22-4).

A section of unweighted\nHF-2 image film from western\nMare Serenitatis is\nshown in figure 22-11. The broad line is the main\nlobe of the specular surface return. Faint lines parallel\nto and above the surface main lobe are negative time\nside lobes of the surface pulse. The positive time\nregion is dominated\nby scattering\nfrom random\nreflectors; this is termed "clutter"\nor "clutter noise."\nAlso, a faint event, occasionally\nbroken up, may be\nseen approximately\nparallel to the. surface. The event\nseems to be too broad to be a side lobe (side-lobe\nwidth one-half of main-lobe width); that is, it appears\nto be a real feature associated with the lunar surface\nor subsurface.\napproximately\n\nIf it is a surface feature,\nlinear and trending parallel\n\nit must be\nto the CSM\n\ngroundtrack.\nThe most likely explanation\nfor the\nevent is a subsurface interface at a depth of approximately\n\n100 m.\n\n22-1 2\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nDigital Data\nForty seconds of HF-1 signal film data were\ndigitized to test the large dynamic range capabilities\nof digital data reduction as well as to search for\nsubsurface events. The digitized data are from a\nregion at the eastern edge of Mare Serenitatis,\nextending westward for approximately 60 km and\ndefined by the groundtrack of revolution 16 (fig.\n22-12). There were 1200 traces or range records\ndigitized, each representing a ground spacing of 50 m.\nEach digitized record contains 2048 words, yielding a\ntotal data set in excess of 2 million words. The data\nwere low-pass filtered in the azimuth or Doppler\ndirection; the capability for more sophisticated azimuth processing was constrained by large computer\nstorage requirements as discussed in the preceding\nsection. Each record was Fourier transformed, and its\namplitude and phase (complex) spectrum was stored\non magnetic tape. The complex spectra showed a\nlarge, apparently random variability from record to\nrecord. The spectra were coherently added or\n\xe2\x80\x9cstacked.\xe2\x80\x9d After stacking approximately 1000\nrecords, the addition of further records failed t o\nchange the characteristics of the stack; that is, the\nprocess had converged and remained constant for\n\nfurther stacking. This stacked spectrum was taken as\nthe ALSE system transfer function for setting UP a\ndeconvolution filter. The spectrum of the stacked\nrecords was filtered and inverse Fourier transformed\nto yield the compressed time-domain system response\nshown in figure 22-13. This response agrees very well\nwith premission measurements and indicates that no\nsurface or subsurface events persisted in the 1200record stack. Persistence of a lunar subsurface event\nor of surface clutter would require a nearly constant\nphase contribution (relative to the phase of the\nspecular surface return) from trace to trace over the\n1200 records. The maximum distance for which the\nspectra of an event will constructively add is called\nthe \xe2\x80\x9ccoherence length\xe2\x80\x9d for the event.\nThe randomness of the spectra is primarily attributable to the random clutter noise from the surface\n(and perhaps subsurface). The compressed pulse from\na single weighted, deconvolved spectrum is shown in\nfigure 22-14. The return signal is completely dominated by clutter noise, an indication that detectable\nsubsurface events must have a long coherence length\ncompared to the coherence length of the clutter. A\n15-km stack is shown in figure 22-15, in which four\nevents in addition to the surface return may be\nidentified. Except perhaps for the third event, com-\n\nFIGURE 22-ll.-Candidate subsurface feature at a depth of approximately 100 m, as seen in HF-2\nimagery.

It\nis possible that a time-varying systematic phase error\ncould cause a similar response, but, to date, results\nobtained primarily from prelaunch testing have indicated that this is probably not the case. This\npossibility will be further investigated by comparing\nresults from multiple orbits over similar lunar regions.\nThe general approach was to take nonoverlapping\nsets of records and to process 5-, lo-, and 15-km\nstacks. Events were plotted in cross sections, and\nthose events that appeared to be alined for at least\nthree separate stacks were connected by straight lines\n(fig. 22-16). In addition, single events are shown for\nthe 15-km stacks.\nIt is important t o note that the coherence length\n\n22-1 3\n\nof a geologic structure may be much less than the\nactual physical length of the structure. It may be\npossible to map out the structure by a series of short\nstacks, but the structure may be noncoherent for a\nlength equivalent to the physical length. An example\nof this is the second event shown on the right side of\nthe cross sections in figure 22-16. The event persists\nin five 5-kmstacks and three IO-km stacks, indicating\na geologic length of 25 to 30 km. The event appears\nonly in the most easterly 15-km stack and is\nnoncoherent for the 15-km stack t o the west. The\nmost likely cause of the noncoherence is the (apparent or real) dip of the feature. The stacking process,\nas described previously, is only coherent for events\napproximately paranel to h e actual lunar surface.\n(The topographic profie has been mapped into the\nhorizontal line indicating zero apparent depth in fig.\n\nFIGURE 22-12.-Groundtrack for digital data reduction test area shown on Apollo 17 metric camera\nframe AS17-0598.

The profile\nappears at the top of the image, and the two\nside-looking surface images stretch below the profile\nand are superposed\non each other. The side-looking\nimagery to the right and left of the spacecraft\ngroundtrack\nfor HF imaging have equal intensity. For\nVHF imaging, the 20 \xc2\xb0 off-vertical\npositioning of the\nantenna beam greatly reduced the superposition,\nor\nleft-fight ambiguity\nproblem.\nHowever, stereoscopic\nviewing of overlapping\nimages from adjacent revolutions permits separation\nof the two images. (See the\ndiscussion under "Stereoscopic\nALSE Imagery.")\nThe side-looking\nHF imagery (figs. 22-18(a) and\n22-18(b)) is dominated\nby the discontinuous\nscattering of near-specular reflections from surface elements.\nThere is little\ncontinuous\nimaging in the scene\nbecause, in preliminary\nprocessing, only a small part\nof the Doppler history of a feature, centered around\nzero Doppler shift, was retained.\nThus, the nearspecular returns from slopes with contours oblique to\nthe spacecraft groundtrack,\nseen only with positive or\nnegative Doppler shifts while approaching\nor departing from oblique\nslopes, are faltered out during\nconversion from signal film to image film. Only very\nweak signal returns near zero Doppler are passed to\nthe image film for the oblique slopes.\nThe VHF imagery (fig. 22-18(c)) has much more\npictorial content than the longer wavelength imagery.\nThis detail results primarily\nfrom the finer ground\nresolution\nof the 2-m-wavelength\nradar and the\ngreater abundance\nof small-scale features discernible\nat the 2-m wavelength.\nThe slopes of these features\nwith contours\nparallel to the spacecraft groundtrack\ndensely populate\nthe radar image with near-zero\nDoppler, near-specular,\nsmall images.

The\nprofile is superimposed on the sinusoid resulting from\nthe elliptical orbit. As a point of reference, the crater\nAitken, approximately 80 km wide under the orbital\ntrack and approximately 5 to 6 km deep from rim to\nfloor, appears at the extreme left of figure 22-18(b).\nThe spacecraft track may be followed, right to left\nand top to bottom, progressing from far-side highlands across Mare Crisium and Mare Serenitatis (all in\nfig. 22-18(a)) on to Mare Imbrium, Oceanus Procellarum, and far-side highlands (all in fig. 22- 18(b)).\nThe local profiling-imaging capability of the ALSE\nis illustrated in figure 22-18(c), a north-looking VHF\nimage recorded during revolution 73.\nimportant aspect of the ALSE imagery is that\n\nit provides a source of improved positional information across a substantial area of the eastern lunar far\nside. Unlike all Apollo orbital camera imagery, ALSE\nimagery does not depend on solar illumination. As a\nresult, the ALSE side-looking surface imagery is the\nonly Apollo imagery obtained between longitudes\n68\xe2\x80\x99 and 152\xe2\x80\x9d W (other than very limited, 1-km-resolution earthshine photography, ref. 22-1). For determination of lunar positions in terms of a coordinate\nmeasured along the length of the orbit, this ALSE\nimagery is free from the troublesome mosaicking and\nrectification problems that beset the determination of\nlunar positions in this region from the melange of\nvariously scaled and tilted Lunar Orbiter images\ncovering the area.\nOne other significant aspect of the side-looking\nsurface imagery is that, in some places, where slope\neffects are negligible or predictable, local differences\nin relative radar albedo can be read directly from the\nside-looking imagery.\n\n-\n\nAPOLLO\nLUNAR\nSOUNDER\nEXPERIMENT\nStereoscopic\n\nALSE\n\nImagery\n\nA major aid to the use of the geometrically\ncomplex ALSE imagery derives from the observation\nformat in which much of the data was obtained. Of\nthe approximately\nsix revolutions\nof data that were\ncollected,\na little more than two revolutions\neach\nwere gathered\nduring adjoining revolutions\nby using\nthe HF systems (20-m- and 60-m-wavelength\nimagery)\non the one hand and by using the VHF system\n(2-m-wavelength\nimagery) on the other. Essentially all\nthe 60-m-wavelength\nimagery from adjacent revolutions and much of the 2-m-wavelength\nimagery from\nadjoining revolutions\ncan be viewed stereoscopically\nwith the result that the side-looking\nimages from the\ntwo sides of the pair of adjoining\norbital\ntracks\nbecome segregated in space in the stereoscopic\nimage.\nOtherwise,\nthe two side-looking\nimages to the north\nand south of the track in a single composite\nradar\nimage are superposed\non each other in some monoscopic image space. The effect of stereoscopic\nviewing\n\n22-17\n\nis as though a radar range of a strip of the lunar\nsurface were wrapped around a hyperbolic cylindrical\nsurface tangent\nto the radar profile (fig. 22-19).\nStereoscopically,\nthe lunar relief is seen superposed\non the general cylindrical\nform of the image. The\nformat of the radar data permits close correlation\nof\nthe side-looking\nradar\nimagery\nwith\nthe orbital\ncamera imagery.\nThus, very exact location\nof the\nradar profile among and within lunar features,\nas\nrecognized in the camera imagery, is possible.\nStereoscopic\n\nHF Imagery\n\nA sample of stereoscopic\nHF imagery was studied\nand measured\nto evaluate\nthe feasibility\nand the\nachievable precision of measuring the relative positions of individual features in the stereoscopic\nimages.\nThe locations numbered\nin figure 22-20 were identified in the three-dimensional\nimage formed by viewing stereoscopically\nthe radar images obtained\non\nrevolution\n16-17 and revolution\n17-18.

Ultimately, measurements rectified to conventional lunar coordinates will\nbe sought. The coordinates of the points in the\nstereoscopic model were measured by using a computerized analytical stereoplotter and are plotted in\nfigure 22-21. An interim arbitrary orthogonal coordinate system was used (fig. 22-19(a)). The system was\noriented with the Y-axis approximately along the\nprofile (plus-Y eastward) and the X-axis in the plane\nof the monoscopic images (plus-X upward in the\nprofie). The Z-axis was oriented perpendicular to the\n\nplane of the monoscopic images in the direction of\nstereoscopic depth (plus-Z northward). The coordinates were read in millimeters at the scale of the\noriginal 70-mm image film. In a set of 51 measured\npoints, readings of the coordinates in the plane of the\nfilm were repeatable to within 5 or 10 pm and depth\nmeasurements of the stereoscopic image perpendicular to the plane of the film were repeatable to within\napproximately 50 pm in a range that varies from\nmore than 3.5 mm near longitude 170" W to more\nthan 9.5 mm near longitude 130" E. The range is\nattributable in part to the variation in the spacing of\nthe spacecraft groundtracks.

The relatively fiat part of the\nprof\'de is deeply notched by two large depressions.\nOne is the 75-km-diameter\ncrater Marconi, which was\nprot\'ded off center toward the southern rim.

The\ncrater is very old; approximately\n50 percent of its\ninterior\nis overlapped\nby superposed\ncraters larger\nthan 20 km in diameter.\nThe crater was in an\noverexposed\npart of Lunar Orbiter I frame M-136 and\nis difficult to recognize there but is decipherable\nin\nenhanced copies.

The image covers a large region extending from southeastern Mare\nSerenitatis eastward across the mountains forming the southeastern border of the Serenitatis basin.\nThe Apollo 17 landing site is near the center of the figure. The brightness change located\napproximately one-fourth of the distance from the profile to the opposite edge of the image is\nintroduced by the sensitivity time control. The dark vertical band, approximately 30 km wide,\nthrough Mons Argaeus is due to the automatic gain control. The imagery north of the groundtracks\nis systematically brighter than that south of the groundtracks because of the nature of the radar\nantenna pattern. Thus, most of the scenery lies north of the groundtracks. Hence, in order to\norient the profiles right side up, north is downward in the side-looking imagery, and, in order to\nplace the features in the northward side-looking imagery in a distribution like that on a map, these\nimages are printed with east on the left.\n\n58 km in diameter. The central peak of De Vries\nCrater is close enough to the spacecraft groundtrack, like the southern walls of Aitken Crater and its\nwestern neighbor, to reflect a fairly strong signal. The\nreturn from the more distant southern wall of De\nVries Crater is barely discernible, and the still more\ndistant northern walls of Aitken Crater and its\nneighbor are not detected. Further data reduction\nwill be performed to minimize this systematic variation in image brightness. The near-circular image at\nlongitude 134\' E actually consists of the images of\nthe central peak and part of the southern wall of the\n58-km-diameter crater, the northern rim of which is\nessentially at the profile. This example illustrates that\na geometric rectification of the imagery to eliminate\nthe cross-track scale variation will substantially aid\ninterpretation of the side-looking surface imagery.\n\nThe utility of the ALSE data for studying the\ntectonics of lunar basins may be seen in samples of\nVHF imagery in figures 22-18(c) and 22-27. In figure\n22-18(c), the crater Dawes and the flat floor of Mare\nTranquillitatis are on the left. An arched and fractured (rilles) boundary separates Mare Serenitatis and\nMare Tranquillitatis, the outer basin of the former\nlying approximately 900 m lower than the latter. The\nwrinkle ridge (right) separates the outer and inner\nbasins; the inner basin is 200 m lower. Phillips et al.\n(ref. 22-5) showed that the wrinkle ridge bounds the\nSerenitatis mascon. The same wrinkle ridge system\nmay also be seen in figure 22-27. Here, in western\nMare Serenitatis, the \'inner basin is also downdropped\napproximately 200 m. The profde in figure 22-27\nsuggests that the ridge represented a zone of elastic\nbending followed by mechanical failure.\n\n22-22\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nFIGURE 22-2L-ALSE 2-m-wavelength image o f the area round the Apollo 1 7 landing site obtained\nduring revolution 25.

The crater Littrow BD is 4 km in diameter.\n\nThe ALSE data shown here support the idea that\nthe Serenitatis basin structure is consistent with a\nmodel of progressive tectonic failure as a consequence\n\nof a superisostaticload placed by the mascon. Such sagging at the lunar surface, with local faulting, could also\nbe caused by a withdrawal of mare magmas from depth.\n\n22-23\n\nAPOLLO LUNAR SOUNDER EXPERIMENT\nO r\n\n-2 -4 -6 -8 -10 E\nE -12 \'E -14 m\nN -16 -18 -20 u\n)\n\n-22 -24 -26 I\n-60\n\n107,\n106\n\n;;> ;\nQ,,*q\n\n----?,Mare\n\nplain, mostly\n\n0-\'; covered by dark\n,\n,\n\nmantle material\n\n108\n\nJ\n\nI\n\n-50\n\nI\n\n-40\n\n-\n\n-.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\nX-axis, mm\n\nFIGURE 22-26. -Profie through the stereoscopic image in\nfigure 22-24.

The profie runs through the numbered\npoints in figure 22-25.\n\nDifferences in Radar Albedo\nTwo types of variations in radar albedo have been\nnoted in the 2-m-wavelength imagery. One is a bright\nhorizontal band around a crater wall, and the other\nconsists of highly reflective halos around certain small\ncraters. Recognition of the quantitative albedo differences depends on the removal of variations in scene\nbrightness due to topographic effects. In the follow\ning examples, topographic effects are assumed to be\nof second order.\nThe 2-m-wavelength imagery of the 6-km-diameter\ncrater Eratosthenes B in southern Mare Imbrium\nshows a bright horizontal ring from approximately\none-fourth to one-half of the distance from the rim\ncrest to the floor (figs. 22-28 and 22-29). It can be\nseen in the stereoscopic image that the crater shape is\nthat of a truncated cone. Thus, the bright ring is not\ndue to a difference in slope. It is probably due t o\nlayering in the materials intersected by the crater, t o\nthe character of erosional debris covering part or all\nof the wall, or to a combination of these.\nTwo examples of small craters with surrounding\nradar-bright halos, Bessel G and Bessel F, 1.2 and 0.7\nkm in diameter, respectively, lie in southwestern Mare\nSerenitatis (fig. 22-27). The similarity of the images\nin both revolutions 25 and 26 is noteworthy. The\nbright halos extend from the crater rim crest outward\n\n0\n\nkm\n\n50\n\nFIGURE 22-27.-Stereoscopic 2-m-wavelength ALSE radar\nimage in southwestern Mare Serenitatis obtained on\nrevolutions 25 and 26. The image shows two kilometersize craters with radar-bright halos, Bessel G and Bessel F.\nA mare ridge trends from the lower right corner of the\nfigure up across the surface profile image and thence\neastward along the southern limb of the stereoscopic\nimage. Where the ridge crosses the profie, it may be seen\nto mark a substantial step in the mare surface with the\nperipheral part of the mare standing higher.\n\napproximately one crater diameter (fig. 22-30). The\ndark interior of the image of a crater slightly smaller\nthan Bessel G interrupts the bright halo of Bessel G\non the eastern side. Bessel G and Bessel F are very\nyoung craters with well-preserved rim and ray deposits. (See, for example, Apollo 17 metric camera\nframe AS17-1512 and Apollo 16 panoramic camera\nframes AS16-9910, 9912, 9915, and 9917.) The\nbright, blocky rim deposits form a continuous\nblanket from the rim crest outward for approximately one crater diameter. Bright filamentous rays\nextend at least seven crater diameters beyond the\ncontinuous rim deposits of Bessel G and 12 crater\ndiameters in the case of Bessel F. The radar brightness\nof the rim deposit is probably a result of rock\nfragments in the continuous rim deposit. In fact, it\nappears that it may be possible to correlate individual\nbright reflections in the radar image with the larger\nfragments in the field of blocks surrounding the\ncrater.

Donahue c\n\nAn ultraviolet\nspectrometer\n(UVS) on board the\nApollo 17 orbiting spacecraft was used in an attempt\nto measure\nultraviolet\nemissions\nfrom the lunar\n\ndetail elsewhere (ref. 23-1). In summary, it is of the\nEbert type, which has been broadly used for space\nresearch, but employed\nnew optical and electronic\ntechniques\nthat provided about an order of magnitude improvement\nin sensitivity. These improvements\nincluded exit slit mirrors that provided a 2.5 increase\nin the signal to the detector pulse-counting\nelectronics (which permitted\ndetection\nof single photoelectrons) and a precision wavelength\nscan system that\npermitted\nthe summation\nof a large number\nof\nspectra without loss of spectral resolution.\nThe spectrometer\nis shown in figure 23-1. The\ntriangular\nstand\non which\nthe instrument\nwas\nmounted (fig. 23-1(a)) was attached to a spacecraft\nbulkhead\nthat was perpendicular\nto the spacecraft\nlongitudinal\naxis. The large baffle over the entrance\nslit excluded\nstray light and was designed\nwith\nmultiple angles in several sections to provide a very\nlarge capability\nfor rejection\nof unwanted radiation.\nThere were no external optical components.\nAs seen in figure 23-1(b),\nlight rays passing\nthrough the spectrometer\nentrance slit are rendered\nparallel by an area on one side of the spherical Ebert\nmirror, which directs the rays to the grating. Diffracted rays from the grating go to the area on the\n\natmosphere.\nThe only emissions observed in the lunar\natmosphere\nwere from a transient atmosphere\nintroduced by the lunar module descent engine; 4 hr after\nthe lunar module landed, these emissions were no\nlonger detectable\nby the spectrometer.\nThe absence\nof atomic hydrogen (H) expected to be present from\nthe solar wind source leads to the conclusion\nthat\nsolar wind protons are neutralized\nand converted to\nmolecular hydrogen (H2) at the lunar surface.\nDuring crossings of the solar-illuminated\nsurface,\nthe spectrometer\nmeasured\nsignificant\nvariations\nin\nsurface\nalbedo.\nThese variations\nare ascribed\nto\nvariations in the refractive index of the lunar surface\nmaterial.\nThe spectrometer\nmade a number\nof nonlunar\nobservations\nin lunar orbit and during transearth\ncoast (TEC), including a search for the ultraviolet\nzodiacal\nlight, solar atmosphere\nemissions,\nEarth\nemissions (including those from the geomagnetic tail),\nstellar emissions,\nand galactic emissions. Although\nsignificant data were obtained from all these observations, analysis of the data requires precise spacecraft\nattitude\ninformation\nin galactic\ncoordinates;\nthis\ninformation\nhas not yet been received. During TEC,\nthe fluorescence\nspectrum of H2 was observed during\na purge of the Apollo 17 fuel cells.\n\nINSTRUMENT\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nother side of the Ebert mirror that focuses the rays\nthrough the entrance slit to the face of a solar-blind\nphotomultiplier\ntube, which transforms\neach photoelectron produced\nby a photon into several million\nelectrons.

More\nrecently, mass spectrometer\nmeasurements\nfrom lunar\norbit (ref. 23-4) and from the lunar surface (ref. 23-5)\nhave resulted in detection of neon, argon, and helium.\nLunar outgassing,\nthe only possible source\nof a\nsubstantial\natmosphere,\noccurs at a rate several orders\nof magnitude\nless than the corresponding\nrate on\nEarth (ref. 23-6). Apart from a\xc2\xb0Ar and radiogenic\nhelium (ref. 23-7), the lunar atmosphere\nmay consist\nonly of neutralized\nsolar wind ions. Thus, the lunar\natmosphere\nwould\nbe expected\nto be composed\nprimarily of neon, argon, hydrogen, and helium, the\nsubsolar surface concentrations\nof which would lie in\nthe range 2 X l0 a to 7 X 103 atoms/cm a (ref. 23-7).\nThe Apollo 17 UVS was mounted in the scientific\ninstrument\nmodule (SIM) with the optic axis pointed\n23 \xc2\xb0 forward and 18 \xc2\xb0 right of the SIM center line\n(when looking toward the spacecraft nose). The SIM\ncenter line nominally\npointed through the center of\nthe Moon when the spacecraft\nwas constrained\nto\nlocal horizontal\nattitude.\nAtmospheric\nobservations\nwere made in various spacecraft attitudes as shown in\nfigure 23-2. The principal mode of operation was the\n\n23-3\nSun\n\nl\n\n9\nFIGURE 23-2.-Schematic\nrepresentation of the modes of\nobservation of the lunar atmosphere. Mode A, the\nprincipal orbital mode, consists of observation through\nthe illuminated atmosphere above the terminator against\nthe dark side of the Moon. In mode B, a contingency\norbital mode, the spectrometer is pointed at a fixed point\nin space, and the line of sight extends through a tangential\nslice of illuminated atmosphere. Mode C was used\nimmediately after transearth injection. The Apollo 17\nUVS has a field of view of 12\xc2\xb0 by 12\xc2\xb0 and looks forward\n23\xc2\xb0 relative to the normal to the spacecraft longitudinal\naxis.\n\nobservation\nthrough\nthe illuminated\natmosphere\nabove the terminator\nagainst the dark side of the\nMoon (mode A in fig. 23-2). This was done automatically once per revolution\nif the spacecraft\nwas\nmaintained in the local horizontal\nattitude (twice if\nthe spacecraft\naxis reversal was performed\nbetween\nterminator\ncrossings).\nA total of 1200 of these\nterminator spectra was obtained.\nTo allow for the possibility that the atmospheric\nemissions might be too weak for detection\nin the\nprincipal mode, two special modes were provided to\nenhance the sensitivity. These modes resulted in most\nof the upper limits quoted herein. In the first mode,\nthe spectrometer\nwas pointed\nat a fLxed point in\nspace and, as the spacecraft\nmoved in its orbit, the\nline of sight extended\nthrough a tangential slice of\nilluminated\natmosphere\n(mode B in fig. 23-2).

It is reasonable to expect an efficient\ntrapping of kilovolt protons on the lunar surface (ref.\n23-18), followed by an upward diffusion of hydrogen\natoms. This upward diffusion would promote recombination either within or at the surface of the soil\ngrains. The molecular\nhydrogen\nwould\nthen be\nreleased by the surface at thermal energy. A theoretical model of Hodges (ref. 23-19) predicts H2 concentrations\nof 3.6 X 103 atoms/cm a at the subsolar\npoint and 2.3 X 104 atoms/cm 3 at the antisolar\npoint.\nAs shown\n\nin table\n\n23-I, the fluorescence\n\nin the H2\n\nLyman\nbands from expected\ndensity would have\nescaped\ndetection\nin the UVS experiment.\nThe\nexpected nighttime density, however, may ultimately\nbe detected by the Apollo 17 neutral mass spectrometer surface experiment\n(ref. 23-20).\nIn conclusion,\nthe Apollo 17 UVS experiment\nhas\nrevealed that atomic\nhydrogen\nis almost totally\nabsent in the lunar atmosphere.\nTo explain this\nobservation, we believe that nearly 100-percent conversion of solar wind protons to molecular hydrogen\nprobably\noccurs at the lunar surface. The expected\nH2 density would have so far escaped detection. We\nwould also expect that H2 will predominate\nover H\nfor the case of Mercury if its atmosphere\nis thin\nenough to allow direct solar wind impact on the\nsurface. A related problem on which this result may\nbear is the formation\nof interstellar\nH2 on dust\nparticles\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\n23-7\n\nmission,\na rocket\nexperiment\nconducted\nby the\nUniversity of Colorado from the White Sands Missile\nRange measured\nthe absolute\nthe Sun in the ultraviolet\n\nspectral brightness\nof\nwhile the UVS was\n\nmeasuring the sunlit spectrum of the Moon. Thus, we\nwere able to make an absolute measurement\nof the\nspectral albedo of the lunar surface.\nBefore the mission, laboratory\nmeasurements\nhad\nbeen made of the spectral albedo\nof lunar dust\nsamples obtained\non the Apollo\n11, 12, and 14\nmissions. The laboratory\nmeasurements\nshowed that\nall three lunar samples had an ultraviolet\nalbedo of\napproximately\n2.2 \xc2\xb1 0.2 percent at all wavelengths in\nthe range of 121.6 to 165.7 nm (ref. 23-23). Because\nalmost all minerals are opaque in the spectral region\nto which the UVS is sensitive, body color plays a\nsmall role in the spectral properties\nof minerals, and\nrefractive index effects probably\ndominate.\nAlternatively, metallic\nsputtering\nproduced\nby solar wind\nimpact (ref. 23-24) may coat the surface and create\nthe observed grayness in the lunar samples. However,\nthe laboratory-measured\nalbedo is not inconsistent\nwith the assumption\nthat the refractive index, and\ntherefore\nthe mineralogical\ncharacter\nof the lunar\nmaterial, is the factor that controls the far ultraviolet\nalbedo.\nFigure 23-6 shows a spectrum obtained from the\nlunar surface near the subsolar\npoint.\nThe very\nsubstantial signals shown, combined with the rocket\nmeasurements\ndescribed previously,\npermit an accurate measurement\nof the lunar albedo in the spectral\nrange 118 to 168 nm. This in situ albedo measurement agrees very well with\nobserved in the laboratory.\n\nthe\n\n2.2-percent\n\nvalue\n\n4000 103\nx\n\n150\n\n(refs. 23-21 and 23-22).\n\nLUNAR\n\nALBEDO\n\nMEASUREMENTS\n\nDuring the orbital mission, approximately\n50 hr of\ndata were obtained with the UVS observing the sunlit\nside of the Moon and approximately\n50 hr of data\nwere obtained\non the dark side.

J. Low at and W. W. Mendell b\n\nThe infrared scanning radiometer\n(ISR) is a thermal imaging device capable of mapping lunar surface\nthermal\nemission\nfrom lunar orbit. The principal\nexperimental\nobjective of the ISR is the measurement\nof lunar nighttime\ntemperatures\nand cooling rates for\nthat portion of the Moon overflown by the orbiting\ncommand\nand service module. Such data are related\n\napproximately\n20 km at the center of the disk, the\nMoon possessed hundreds\nof features that remained\nwarm relative to their environs during the eclipse.\nStudies of these "thermal\nanomalies"\nindicated\nsurface rock exposures\nassociated\nwith fresh impact\nfeatures as an explanation.\nMore recent correlations\nof the eclipse data with Earth-based\nradar measurements (ref. 24-4) show that a one-to-one\ncorrespondence does not exist between boulder fields and\ninfrared anomalies.\n\nto the physical\nparameters\n(density\nand thermal\nconductivity)\nof the local surface layer.\nThe thermal emission at the surface of the Moon\nserves to balance the solar radiation absorbed at the\nsurface\nand the heat flow into or out of the\nsubsurface.\nHeat conduction\nthrough the surface is\ngenerally small because the lunar soil is an excellent\nthermal insulator.\nTherefore,\nthe daytime temperature regime is dominated\nby such factors as albedo,\nSun angle, and local slope. Conversely, the nighttime\nemission represents\nthe reradiation\nof heat stored\n\ntemperature\ndistributions\nare influenced\nby structure\nto a depth\nof a few tens of centimeters.\nMany\nobservers (refs. 24-5 to 24-9) have attempted to map\nthe nighttime Moon from Earth to take advantage of\nthe improved\nsubsurface\nresolution.\nHowever,\nthe\nobservational\ndifficulties\n(ref. 24-8) associated with\nthe low level of thermal\nemission and with the\n\nduring the lunar day and is largely dependent\non the\nphysical properties of the surface layer.\nA simple, one-dimensional\nmodel of the soil layer\n(ref. 24-1) can be used to demonstrate\nthe general\nbehavior of surface temperature.\nIn such a model,\nfamilies of temperature\ncurves (faired curves in fig.\n24-1) can be generated in terms of a single thermal\nparameter\n1"=(koc) -_,\nwhere\nk is the thermal\nconductivity,\nO is\nspecific heat. This\ntive transfer in the\nto characterize\nthe\nEarth-based\ntemperature\nsec _.\n\nIn contrast\nto the eclipse cooling, which lasts for\nonly a few hours, the lunar nighttime\ncooling regime\nlasts for 14 days. The nighttime\nthermal gradients\nextend deeper into the subsurface,\nand the surface\n\nterrestrial\natmosphere\nhave precluded\nsubstantial\nsuccess. The ISR provides a solution to the observational problem with an absolute radiometric\nmeasurement of lunar nighttime temperatures\nthat represents\nan order-of-magnitude\nimprovement\nin spatial and\nradiometric resolution over Earth-based work.\n\nthe bulk density,\nand c is the\nsimplified model disregards radiasurface layer, but it is still useful\nthermal response in terms of 1\'.\n\nINSTRUMENT\n\nmeasurements\nof the lunar midnight\n(ref. 24-2) place 1\' _ 850 cal-I\ncm 2 K\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe ISR is a thermal imaging line scanner (ref.\n24-10).

The difference in the\nthermal signatures of the two scarps demonstrates\nthe\ndominance of local slope (i.e., local Sun angle) in the\ndaytime thermal regime.\nIn figure 24-4, three lunar nighttime\nscans are\nshown.\nThe scan in figure 24-4(a)\ncomes from\nOceanus Procellarum.\nThe center of the scan is\ndominated\n\nby the crater Kepler A.

Of special interest were the heavy (high atomic\nnumber)\nhigh-energy\nparticles\nwith high loss of\nenergy on their path through\nmaterial (HZE particles). For this purpose, layers of several biologic\nspecies were stacked\nalternately\nwith various track\ndetectors.\nThe results will be very useful in estimating\npotential radiation hazards to astronauts during longduration space missions. This work complements\nthe\nresults of the Apollo 16 biostack experiment\n(biostack I), in which a variety of radiobiologic\nend\npoints have been found to differ in sensitivity to the\npenetration\nof HZE particles. Artemia salina eggs, for\ninstance,\nhit by an HZE particle\nshowed a high\nreduction in larval emergence and hatching as well as\nthe induction of several developmental\nanomalies.\nPreliminary\nanalyses of the biostack II radiation\ndetectors indicate a cosmic "background"\nradiation of\n\nf\n\n750 X 10 -s\nJ/kg.

Generally, the viability of the\nflown biologic objects did not appear to be affected\nby any additional\nrandom space flight factors. From\nthese observations,\na scientifically\nprofitable\nevaluation of the biostack II experiment\nis anticipated.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nTHEORY\n\nDuring space missions outside the Earth magnetosphere, a spacecraft\nencounters\nthe full spectrum of\ngalactic cosmic radiation.\nOutside the geomagnetic\nfield, there is no cut-off effect. Therefore, the energy\nspectrum of cosmic ray nuclei includes particles of\nlow energies. These heavy nuclei (HZE particles) of\nextremely high values of linear energy transfer (LET)\nin the Bragg peak may reach astronauts\ndespite\nshielding by the spacecraft wall (ref. 25-1). Particles\nthat penetrate\nthe spacecraft\nmay pass through or\nstop in biologic\nmatter.\nTherefore,\nthe radiation\nhazards to man during long-duration\nspace missions,\nespecially the HZE component\nof cosmic radiation\nwhich man does not encounter\non Earth, must be\n\naUniversity of Frankfurt.\nbMax Planck Institut fur Biophysik, Frankfurt.\nCUniversity of Marburg.\ndUniversity of Toulouse.\neUniversity of Strasbourg.\nfUniversity of Kiel.\ngUniversity of San Francisco.\nhAtomic Energy Commission, Republic of France.\nIGesellschaft far Strahlen und Umweltforschung, Frankfurl.\nJUniversity of Wttrzburg.\nkU.S. Representative for biostack, University of Frankfurt.\n5"Principal Investigator.\n\nprecisely estimated.\nThus, all biologic experiments\nin\nspace should consider the possible influence of HZE\nparticles in any observed biologic effects.\nThe biostack\nexperiment\nprovided\na unique\nmethod to determine\nthe biologic efficiency of HZE\nparticles during\nspace flight. The last two lunar\nmissions provided\nthe last opportunity\nfor several\nyears to study this phenomenon\noutside the Earth\n25-1\n\n25-2\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nmagnetosphere. The biostack I1 experiment on board\nthe Apollo 17 spacecraft complemented biostack I on\nboard Apollo 16 (ref. 25-2).\nThe biologic objects in biostack I1 were selected\nbecause of well-established scientific baseline information and technical points of view. These biologic\nobjects were (1) spores of the bacterium Bacillus\nsubtilis, (2) cysts of the protozoon Colpoda cuculus,\n(3) seeds of the crucifer Arubidopsis thaliana, (4) eggs\nof the shrimp Artemia salina, ( 5 ) eggs of the beetle\nRbolium confusum, and (6) eggs of the grasshopper\nCarausius morosus. The biologic attributes studied in\nthe six biologic species included inhibition of germination, inhibition of cell growth, inhibition of organ\ndevelopment, developmental anomalies in various\nstages of growth, and mutation induction.\nThe biologic area hit by an HZE particle was\ndetermined from adjacent physical track detectors\nincluding nuclear emulsions (Ilford K2 and K )\nS,\ncellulose nitrate (CN) sheets, polycarbonate (Lexan)\nsheets, and silver chloride (AgC1) crystals. Thus, the\nbiostack I1 experiment was well established to\nidentify an individual HZE particle and to correlate\npossible biologic effects in its path or trajectory. The\nresults will help to provide information on the\nmechanism of the biologic interaction of HZE particles, currently not available on Earth. Such information is necessary to predict possible radiation hazards\nto man in space.\nIn addition, the evaluation of the track detectors\nw l yield the spectra of charge and energy as well as\ni\nl\nthe energy loss of the particles studied. Establishing\nthe modification of these spectra attributable to\nabsorption by the biostack material will yield practical information for establishing radiation protection\nrequirements for manned space flights.\n\nArtemia salina eggs (refs. 25-4 and 25-6); damage to\nhair follicles of the black mice (refs. 25-7 and 25-8);\nand brain injuries in mice (ref. 25-9) and monkeys\n(ref. 25-10). The light flashes observed by the\nastronauts during the Apollo lunar missions stimulated systematic studies of this phenomenon on Earth\n(ref. 25-11) and in space (ref. 25-12). The results\nsuggested that the light flashes might be caused by\nionization of HZE particles in the tissue of the retina;\nhowever, there has been no confirmation of any\nhazards associated with this phenomenon.\nThe terms \xe2\x80\x9cdose\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crelative biologic efficiency\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be used to describe the biologic effects\nof the HZE particles encountered in space. More\nappropriately, the terms \xe2\x80\x9cion kill\xe2\x80\x9d (ref. 25-13) and\n\xe2\x80\x9cmicrobeamyy(ref. 25-14) are used to describe their\nradiobiologic characteristics. This choice of terms\nindicates that a single traversal by a heavy nucleus,\nwith a sufficiently high LET, produces an energy\ndissipation in the biologic microstructure comparable\nto a beam of very narrow cross section. The LET\ndistribution can properly be expressed in terms of\nintegral track length; this gives a more complete\n\nINTERACTION OF HZE PARTICLES\nWITH BIOLOGIC MATTER\nIt has been established that HZE particles have\nhigh biologic efficiency. This statement is based on\nseveral balloon- and satellite-borne radiobiologic\nstudies, because Earth-based equipment is currently\nincapable of producing accelerated heavy particles\nwith exact properties of HZE particles. Many effects\nattributable to HZE particles were observed. These\neffects included mutation induction in Escherichia\ncoli cells (ref. 25-3), in barley seeds (ref. 254), and in\ncorn seeds (ref. 25-5);developmental disturbances in\n\nFIGURE 25-1 .-Biostack software composed of biologic\nlayers and sheets of radiation detectors.\n\nBIOSTACK EXPERIMENT\n\npicture of the energy dissipation pattern in tissue (ref.\n25-1).\nThe understanding of these radiobiologic problems\nwould be improved by space experiments investigating the critical LET values of HZE particles for\ndifferent types of biologic damage. The biostack.\nexperiment met this requirement. Biostack I included\na wide spectrum of biologic objects with established\nradiobiologic end points to which the degree of their\nresponse to HZE particles could be related (ref. 25-2).\nSome of the biologic processes studied were not\ninfluenced remarkably by a penetrating cosmic ion.\nConversely, other biologic processes were almost\ntotally disturbed or inhibited by the passage of a\nsingle ion; for example, the emergence and hatching\nof Artemia salina eggs and subsequent malformations\nin larvae. Correlation of these effects with the charge\nand energy loss of the effective HZE particle resulted\nin determination of the critical LET thresholds for\nseveral radiobiologic processes. Thus, the biostack I\nand biostack I1 experiments were well suited t o help\nunderstanding of the complex phenomenon of biologic response to HZE particle penetration and\ninteraction.\n\nAPOLLO 17 FLIGHT U N I T\nThe biostack I1 experiment had the same design\nconcept as biostack I (ref. 25-2). A hermetically\nsealed, cylindrical aluminum container, 10 cm long\nand 12.5 cm in diameter, enclosed a stack of 257\nsheets (fig. 25-1). Selected biologic objects in the\nresting state in monolayers (fig. 25-2) were sandwiched between several different visual particle detectors. This arrangement made it possible to trace\nthe path of an HZE particle through the stack and to\ndetermine the trajectory of the heavy ion in the\nbiologic layer (fig. 25-3). Individual evaluation of the\nbiologic objects hit by an HZE particle, in parallel\nwith characterization of the respective hitting HZE\nparticle, permits estimation of the biologic efficiency\nof the HZE particle along its path into or through the\nbiologic object.\nThe biostack I1 storage area in the Apollo 17\ncommand module was the same as that used for\nbiostack I on the Apollo 16 spacecraft. This area was\nchosen so that shielding to cosmic radiation would be\nminimal.\nAfter their return to Frankfurt, an external inspection of the three biostack I1 units (flight unit,\n\n25-3\n\nFIGURE 25-2.-A biologic layer of the biostack I1 flight unit\nconsisting of Artemia salina eggs embedded i a foil of\nn\npolyvinyl alcohol.\n\nbackup unit, and Earth control unit) revealed no\ndamage. The biostack I1 flight unit (serial number\n(S/N 7)) and the backup unit (S/N S), used as an\nEarth control at the NASA John F. Kennedy Space\nCenter and the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space\nCenter, were disassembled immediately after their\narrival in Frankfurt. No alteration of or damage to\nthe biologic objects and detectors could be noticed.\nDisassembly was accomplished without complication.\nDuring disassembly, the pattern of the biologic\nobjects of each layer positioned directly over a K2\nnuclear emulsion was transferred to the upper side of\nthe corresponding emulsion by optical illumination\n(fig. 25-4), as established for biostack I (ref. 25-2).\nFurther, a coordinate grid was placed on the bottom\nof each sheet of a nuclear emulsion by optical\nillumination. Following disassembly, the biologic and\nphysical components of the biostack I1 flight unit and\nthe Earth control unit were distributed to collaborating research laboratories for processing and evaluation.\n\nPRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS\nTotal Dose of Cosmic Ionizing Radiation\nThe total dose of cosmic ionizing radiation (background radiation) was measured by lithium fluoride\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n25-4\n\nEtch hole in CN\n\nEtch hole in CN\n\nEtch cone i n CN carrying a layer\nof Bacillus subtilis spores\n(The biological layer was protected during etching.)\n\n-Layer of Bacillus subtilis spores\n-Layer of Bacillus subtilis spores\n\nEtch cone i n CN carrying a layer\nof Bacillus subtilis spores\n*(\n\n.-\n\n-\n\na.\n.!\n\n_\nI\n\n;\n\n_\n\nI\n\nFIGURE 25-4-A K 2 nuclear emulsion of the biostack I1\nflight unit showing the shadow of an egg of Curuusius\nmorosus and the track of an HZE particle that has hit the\negg.\n\nParticle Detection\n\n- 1..\n\n*\n\nStopping end of the track\n\nA 0\n\nFIGURE 25-3.-Track of an HZE particle penetrating a\nBucillus s u b t i h subunit of the biostack I flight unit (total\nm.\nlength 1900 p )\n\n(LiF) thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD).

The fluence of\nthe fast particles of low charge (2 = 1 or 2 = 2) is\ncorrelated with the number of nuclear stars produced\nby collisions of these particles with nuclei of the\nemulsion. The mean density, obtained from evaluation of five K2 plates, was 12 700 stars/cm3. The\nfluence of the medium and heavy ions (Z>6),\ncounted in 40 cm2 of K2 plates positioned in the\nmiddle of the stack, was 40 particles/cm2.

The total\nfluence of all heavy ions in the middle of the stack\nwas 140 particles/cmZ. The photometric measurements of the charge of the cosmic ions are in\nprogress.\nAll plastic sheets that have been etched are\n250-pm-thick Daicel-71 CN. They show wellestablished tracks (figs. 25-5 to 25-7), which can be\n\nanalyzed readily. All plastic sheets carrying biologic\nlayers were etched by applying the special method\n(ref. 25-2) in which the biologic side of the sheets was\nsealed against sodium hydroxide while the other\nplastic side was etched to develop the tracks formed\nby the penetrating HZE particles. Optical scanning\nwith a Leitz stereomicroscope (2.5-power objective\nand 25-power eyepiece) of CN sheets positioned at\nthe top and bottom of the stack showed the\nabsorption of particles by the stack material (table\n25-11), which was in agreement with the K2 emulsion\nrecordings.\nNormally, AgCl detectors require irradiation with\nyellow light for stabilization of the.tracks of passing\nparticles. Because this illumination was not possible\nin biostack 11, detectors with reduced fading were\nused. In these AgCl crystals, the integral blackness of\ntracks decreased to values of approximately 25 and\n15 percent, respectively, but the geometric track\nwidth remained almost constant. The geometric track\nwidth allows for a rough estimate of the charge of the\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n25-6\n\nparticles. Tracks of particles with charge Z < 4 are\nrecorded only if not relativistic. The surviving tracks\nwere divided into five groups (table 25-111). An\nexample of a track from each group is shown in figure\n25-8. The density of surviving nuclear stars was found\nto be 4500 f 650 stars/cm3 of AgC1.\n\nBIOLOGIC FLIGHT OBJECTS\nViability studies of the flight controls were performed first. These controls are the biostack I1\nbiologic objects not hit by a heavy particle. Germination and outgrowth of Bacillus subtilis flight and\nEarth controls were studied in special incubation\nchambers on nutrient broth agar at 310 K (ref.\n25-15 ) . NO significant differences were observed in\ngermination and outgrowth (table 25-IV) or cell\nelongation rate (fig. 25-9) of the flight and Earth\ncontrols.

Good agreement was\nobserved on germination and outgrowth of Bacillus\nsubtih spores in both biostack experiments. However, after 130 min of incubation of biostack I1\nsample spores, cellular elongation began to decline\nbecause of a rather high density of spores. This decline differs from the biostack results, where growth\nwas followed up to the first and second cellular division (ref. 25-2). In the layers of biostack 11, the spore\nwas approximately 3 times higher than that of\nbiostack I to increase the chance of spore hits\n\nTABLE 25-V.-Comparison of the First Data\non Cosmic Radiation Obtained in Biostack\nI and II Flight Units\n\n-1\n\nI\n\nFlight\nunit\n\n1\nI\n\nI\n\nBiostack I\nBiostack I1\n\nBackground dose,\n\n2.34 X lo6\n2.41\n\nFlux, particleslcm\xe2\x80\x99 hr.\nrecorded inCN directed\ntoward-\n\nemulsion\n\n0.08\n.13\n\nI\n\nby HZE particles.

Studies on the biologic effects attributable\nto HZE particles and the analysis of such biologically\neffective particles will follow. These studies w l be\ni\nl\nbased on the scientific results obtained from the\nevaluation of biostack I, which is still in progress.\nSpores of Bacillus subtilis strain 168 in biostack I\nwere found to be rather resistant to hits of HZE\nparticles. Therefore, biostack I1 contained a second\nstrain, pol- (HA 101 (59) F, ref. 25-16), which is very\nsensitive to radiation, for comparison with the more\nradiation resistant strain 168.\nStudies on strains of the same species of Artemia\nsalina that differ in their radiation sensitivity have\nbeen performed on eggs from biostack I. The results\nwere very informative. In the radiation sensitive strain\n(Hayward), only 10 percent of the hit eggs were able\nto pass the first stage of development; that is, the\nemergence from the egg. In contrast, the radiation\nresistant strain (Utah) showed an emergence frequency of 61 percent. After successful emergence,\nhowever, continued development stopped even in\nmost hit objects of the radiation resistant strain,\nindicating a hatching decrease to 15 percent (table\n25-VI). From these observations, it follows that the\nHZE-particle-induced damage in the encysted blastula\nof the eggs may influence gastrula formation and even\nthe hatching process of the nauplius or larva of\nArtemia salina. Many nauplii that had succeeded in\nhatching from hit eggs did not survive the stage of\nfirst casting of the skin, which is accompanied by a\nhigh mitosis rate. Complex malformations observed in\nthe nauplii from hit eggs are shortened extremities or\nabnormalities of the thorax and the abdomen (fig.\n25-12). The biostack I1 studies may confirm these\nobservations and extend them by systematic histologic investigations.\nThree biostack units were available as Earth\ncontrols. Unit S/N 8 is already disassembled and\nserves as an untreated Earth control.

Other tissues were also taken into consideration,\nparticularly\nthe skin, because the skin of\nballoon-borne\nblack mice and black rabbits has been\nreported\nto have been severely damaged\nduring\nexposure to cosmic ray particles (refs. 26-1 and 26-2).\nThe idea of the pocket mouse experiment\noriginated\nfrom reports by astronauts that they had periodically\nseen light flashes during Apollo missions (ref. 26-3).\nSuch flashes are thought to represent an excitatory\neffect caused by cosmic ray particles as they traverse\nthe retina (refs. 26-4 and 26-5). The questions arose\nwhether,\nin addition\nto excitation,\nthe retinal cells\nsuffered damage and whether other cells, particularly\nthose in the brain,\nmay be damaged by cosmic\nradiation.\nLesions have been found in the brains of guinea\npigs and monkeys flown at high altitudes in balloons\n(refs. 26-6 and 26-7). However, the lack of adequate\nmonitoring\nby cosmic ray particle detectors\nprecluded judgment\nas to the significance of the lesions.\nIn the Apollo 17 experiment,\ngreat care was therefore\ntaken to provide optimum monitoring\nfor the brains\n\naAbraham\n\nof the pocket mice and, to some extent,\nand other head structures by implanting\ndetectors\n\nfor the eyes\ncosmic ray\n\nunder the scalp.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nOF EXPERIMENT\nPocket\n\nMouse\n\nThe pocket\nmouse (Perognathus\nlongimembris)\n(fig. 26-1) was selected as the biological specimen for\nthis experiment.\nThis heteromyid\nrodent from the\nadd regions of the southwestern\nUnited States and\nnorthern\nMexico does not require drinking water,\nsubsists\non seeds and plant\nmaterial,\nand is a\nfacultative\nhomeotherm\nwith an ability to drop its\nmetabolic\nrate dramatically\nwhile\nat rest or in\nresponse to environmental\nstress (ambient\ntemperature, lack of food, confinement)\n(refs. 26-8 to 26-10).\nIn addition,\nthe wastes are concentrated\n(less than\n1 \xc3\x97 10 --4 kg/day each of urine and feces) and food\ncan be provided\nnatural hoarders.\n\nad libitum because the mice are\nThe pocket mouse also was chosen\n\nfor the experiment\nfor the following reasons.\n1.

The layers\nwere of identical shape and surface area\n(xO.55 cm2/layer). The edges of the monitors were\nheat sealed and, in the finished state, were approximately 580 pm (xO.5 mm) thick. The monitors were\ncoated with paralene to make them impermeable to\nthe fixatives in which the heads of the animals were\nto be kept for a time. The monitor was attached to a\nbase (or platform) made of a silicone rubber material\n(382-RTV). This base was produced in a mold of the\nskull, so that its undersurface fitted the skull contour.\nWhen the ensemble was placed on the skull, the\nmonitor covered the entire brain, from the olfactory\nbulbs anteriorly to the cerebellum posteriorly (fig.\n26-2).\nBefore implantation of the monitor assembly, the\ntop of the head was depilated. Within about a week\nafter surgery, new hair growth was evident; within a\nmonth, the hair was fully restored (fig. 26-3).\nRemoval of monitors at autopsy at varying intervals\nafter implantation disclosed considerable fibrous tissue growth along the margins of monitors in about\n\nFIGURE 26-3.-Appearance of the heads of pocket mice\nafter monitor implantation.

If cosmic ray damage were incurred,\nit\nwould be detected most easily while the damage was\nfresh (i.e., before the lesions could heal). Hence,\nautopsy\nof the animals was performed\nshortly after\nthe animals were received at the Lyndon B. Johnson\nTropical Medical Center on American Samoa 7 hr\nafter splashdown.\nIf, on microscopic\nexamination,\na lesion were\nfound in the brain, it would be necessary to know\nwhether its position coincided with the trajectory\nof\na cosmic ray particle.\nTherefore,\nthe plan called for\nthe insertion of needles through the brains of control\nmice along the cosmic ray trajectories\nfound in the\nsubscalp monitors\nof the Apollo mice. Then if the\nposition\nof a lesion in the brain of an Apollo mouse\ncoincided with a hole left by a needle in the brain of\na control mouse, the conclusion would be warranted,\nif other conditions were met (such as destruction\nof a\nrow of nerve cells or a tissue lesion with a welldefined\nboundary),\nthat the lesion was actually\ncaused by a cosmic ray particle.\nThe plan also called for serially sectioning\neach\nApollo mouse head and all five or six control mouse\nheads in a plane parallel with the trajectory\nof the\nmost "promising"\nparticle observed in the subscalp\nmonitor. This plan was based on the expectation\nthat,\nbecause\nthe trajectory\nof cosmic ray particles\nis\nessentially\nlinear, any track of tissue damage might\nalso be linear.\n\nExperiment\n\nPackage and Preparation\nfor Flight\n\nA major element in the preparation\nfor flight was\nthe development\nof a package that would house the\nmice and provide dependable life support for the 13\ndays of the mission. In compliance\nwith the constraints imposed by the Apollo spacecraft, the experiment package was a closed, self-sustaining system and\nrequired\nno inflight\nhandling,\ndata recording,\nor\nelectrical\npower. Potassium\nsuperoxide\n(KO2) was\nchosen as the carbon dioxide (CO2)absorber\nand the\nsource of oxygen. Sixty tests in canisters with KO2,\nwith six mice used in each test, were performed\nbefore the configuration\nwas regarded as acceptable\nfor flight.\n\n26-3\n\nAn extremely\nvital parameter\ninfluencing\nthe\ndesign of the experiment\nwas the ambient temperature to which the package would be exposed during\nthe flight. Package temperature\naffects independently\nboth the metabolic rate of the mice and the chemical\nreaction rate of KO2. In addition, temperature\nhas a\nbasic effect on the overall well-being of the mice. The\nanticipated\nambient temperature\nwas not established\nuntil approximately\n3 months before launch. This\nnecessitated\nsome redesign of the package to accommodate an increase in temperature\nas much as 8.8 K\nover that used earlier. The changes in the anticipated\ntemperature\nproFde also resulted in the decision to fly\nfive mice, instead of the originally planned six, to\nensure sufficient oxygen supply to satisfy the metabolic requirements\nof the mice at the higher temperature. During the KO2 tests in the elevated temperature environment,\nthe oxygen pressure within the\npackage rose to more than 8.3 \xc3\x97 104 N/m 2 absolute\n(12 psia). Extensive control studies were undertaken\nto ascertain whether\noxygen itself under increased\npressure was injurious to the brain and retina and, if\nso, whether the damage would obscure lesions produced by cosmic particles.\nBased on data obtained from a study of approximately 90 control pocket mice, a permissible upper\nlimit of 8.3 \xc3\x97 104 N/m 2 absolute (12 psia) oxygen\npressure and an ambient temperature\nnot exceeding\n305.37\nK (90 \xc2\xb0 F) were established.\nAlthough\nthe\nexperiment\nwas designed basically as a closed system,\npressure relief valves that vented into the spacecraft\nwere installed\nto prevent\nthe pressure\ninside the\ncanister from exceeding this upper limit.\nThe experiment\npackage was stowed in the A-6\nlocker of the command module (CM). The only other\ninterface with the spacecraft\nwas the dissipation\nof\nthe small amount of heat generated by the package\n(from 2 to 3.2 W (7 to 11 Btu/hr)) by conduction\nto\nthe stowage locker walls.\nThe experiment\nflight package, partially disassembled, is shown in figure 26-4. A 0.1778-m-diameter,\n0.29-m-long,\nhermetically\nsealed aluminum\ncanister\ncontained\nsix 0.0286-m-diameter\nperforated\naluminum tubes and one 0.625-m-diameter\nperforated\nstainless steel tube. The six aluminum tubes, five of\nwhich housed the five mice and their food, were\ncircumferentially\narranged around the centrally\nlocated stainless steel tube (fig. 26-4). The stainless\nsteel tube contained\n0.530\nkg (1.17 lb) of KO2,\nwhich provided a habitable atmosphere\nfor the mice.\n\n26-4\n\nFIGURE 264-Flight\nassembled.\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\npackage (BIOCORE) partly dis-\n\nA layer of Teflon felt (0.0625 in.) thick and a fine\nmesh stainless steel screen were wrapped around the\nstainless steel tube to serve as a particle (dust) barrier\nbetween the KO2 and the mice. Two manually\ncontrolled valves for flushing the package and two\npressure relief valves were located in the removable\nend plate of the canister. The pressure relief valves\nwere set to maintain the package at 3.8 X lo4 to\n5.2 X lo4 N/m2 (5.5 to 7.5 psi) above the ambient\npressure. Between the relief valves and the atmosphere within the package was a filter of Teflon felt\n0.0016 m (0.0625 in.) thick and a fiber-glass highefficiency particulate air filter capable of filtering\n0.3-pm particles. A shield was installed over the valves\nto protect them and to support the package in the\nCM locker. The overall package length was 0.35 m\n(13.75 in.), and the total weight was 6.1 kg (13.5 lb).\nTwo maximum-minimum temperature recorders (developed for the microbial ecology evaluation device\n(MEED) flown on Apollo 16 and 17) were located in\nthe end cap of two tubes containing mice.\nPreparation of the hardware for flight was initiated\nat the NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC)\non December 2, 1972, at 20:50 G.m.t. Five mice,\npreviously selected from a colony of 30 mice brought\nto KSC from the NASA Ames Research Center\n(ARC), were installed in five of the six mouse tubes,\neach with 30 g of a special seed mixture (hulled\nmillet, oat groats, whole rye, and shelled sunflower\nseeds). The sixth mouse tube was left empty. After\nassembly, the package was flushed for 25 min with\noxygen. Pressure in the package then was reduced to\napproximately 3.6 X lo4 N/m2 absolute (5.2 psia),\nand a small amount of helium was added for leak\nchecking. After the leak check, the total package\npressure was further reduced and maintained at\n2.3 X lo4 to 3.1 X lo4 N/m2 absolute (3.3 to 4.5\np i a ) for 36 hr by adding oxygen on demand.\nSupplying the mice with oxygen from an external\n\nsource during this initial period was necessary until\nthe KO2 reaction with C 0 2 and water vapor was\nadequate to generate oxygen at the rate required to\nsatisfy the metabolic requirements of the mice. After\nremoval of the external oxygen supply, the total and\npartial oxygen pressures were monitored until the\npackage was prepared for installation in the spacecraft at 19:OO G.m.t. on December 5, 1972. During\nthis period, the total pressure varied from a low of\n2.2 X lo4 N/m2 absolute (3.2 psia) to a high of\n3.4 X lo4 N/m2 absolute (4.9 psia), when monitoring\nwas discontinued.\nBefore the package was released for installation in\nthe spacecraft, the outside surface was cleaned with\nFreon PCF. The package was installed in the A-6\nlocker before the locker was placed in the CM. Two\nBeta webbing (Fluorel (RL3603) coated) straps\nretained the package in the locker. Micro-Syl cushion\nmaterial was cemented to the locker walls as required\nto support the package, with one end of the canister\npressed against a locker end wall and the heat-sink\n\xe2\x80\x9cfeet\xe2\x80\x9d on the cylindrical portion against a side wall.\nThermal-conducting grease was applied to these contacting surfaces to ensure a good thermal path from\nthe package to the locker walls. A radiation monitor\nwas taped to the inside surface of the bottom of the\nA-6 locker to provide a measure of the local radiation\nfield near the BIOCORE. The monitor was obtained\nfrom the backup units of the crew personal dosimeters.\nTwo identical BIOCORE packages were prepared;\nthe one with the most favorable startup characteristics (serial number (S/N) 03) was selected for the\nflight. The other (the backup package, S/N 0 ) on\n5,\nreturn t o ARC, was subjected to all the stresses\nanticipated for the Apollo flight. The total pressure\nwithin the backup control canister rose to a maximum of 8.3 X lo4 N/m2 absolute (12 psia) during\nthe test (fig. 26-5).\n\nRECOVERY OF PACKAGE A N D\nAN IM A L PROCESSI N G\nThe experiment package was removed from the\nCM at 23:30 G.m.t. on December 19, 1972. The total\npressure in the package was 7 X lo4 N/m2 absolute\n(10.1 psia) at that time. After removal from the CM,\nthe total pressure in the package was increased to\n1OX lo4 N/m2 absolute (15 psia) and the package\nwas flushed with a 50:50 mixture of oxygen and\n\nBIOCORE\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nMouse\nMouse weight, g\nnumber Start\nEnd Change\n\nCage\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n3486\n3550\n3551\n3329\n3554\n\n11.0\n10.8\n10.2\n9.8\n9.7\n\nAverage...\n\n11.0\n9.2\n8.9\n8.2\n8.3\n\n10.30\n\nFoodweight, g\nStart\n30.0\n30.0\n30.0\n30.0\n30.0\n30.0\n\n0\n-1.6\n-1.3\n-1.6\n-1.4\n\n9.12\n\n26-5\n\n-1.18\n\nEnd\n9.7\n7.9\n17.1\n17.6\n2.0\n10.98\n\nChange\n-20.3\n-22.1\n-12.3\n-12.4\n-28.0\n-19.(R\nSimulated\n\nTransport\nfrom KSC to ARC,\n\n10414 r-\n\n9.6\n\nextravehicular\nactivity\n\nVibration and\n\n",,, acceleration\n\n12r\n\n8.3\n6.9\n\n,. 10 utomatic pressure\n"_\nl\nregulator\n5.5 - =. 8 /\nE\n_\n6 /\n_4.1\n\nic_\n_\n\n%\n\n2.7\n\n_"\n\n_*C_,/_\n_\n4_ _r_\'_\nLJ-\'_\n=_\n_Q L._u\n\n1.4\n\n_\n_-ooo"\nr\n\n2i\n24\n\n0\n\ni\n48\n\ni\n72\n\n0 Totalpressure\nD Partialpressure of oxygen\n\nI\n96\n\nJ\n120\n\nI\n144\n\nI\n168\n\na\n192\n\nI\n216\n\nJ\n240\n\nI\n264\n\nI\n288\n\n_)o\n\n,,3-hr\n\n,,\'oxy_jen0 ,,\'\n, I,,\n_\n\nhelium\nflush\n\n//[7\n.\n.i ..\nAcceleration\nand shock\n\nt\n312\n\nI\n336\n\ni\n360\n\ni\n384\n\nI\n408\n\ni\n432\n\nElapsed\ntime,\nhr\nFIGURE 26-5.-Record\nof tests on backup canister.

A\ntube is attached to the outlet (upper) valve of the\npackage, and another tube is attached to the inlet (lower)\nvalve. On the recovery ship, the following procedure was\nfollowed. Total pressure within the package was fust\nascertained by the reading on the pressure gage (the large,\ncylindrical object in the upper left comer of the box). A\nneedle valve (upper left, barely visible near the attendant\xe2\x80\x99s\nleft thumb) was slowly opened to vent the pressure inside\nthe canister to ambient pressure in the event the canister\npressure was greater than ambient. The tube from the\nflow regulator (conical instrument to lower left near the\nattendant\xe2\x80\x99s right thumb) was then attached to the inlet\nvalve of the package. The valves of the six oxygen-helium\nbottles and the inlet valve were then opened, and the flow\nregulator was slowly opened and set at the desired level.\nThe gas then flowed through a manifold (U-shaped tube,\nof which the ends near the canister are visible) into the\npackage to begin the flushing; the gas in the package\nescaped through the needle valve.\n\nTABLE 26-1.-Mouse and Food Weights\nI\n\nI\n\nMOUE\n\nnumber\n\nMouse weight, g\nPreflight\n\nI\n\nPostflight\n\nA-3305\n\nFood weight, g\nPreflight\n\n30.0\n30.0\n30.0\n\nI\n\nPostflight\n\n7.6\n16.2\n6.3\n17.4\n20.1\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Dead when package was opened.\n\nwas removed, and photographs were taken of the\nposition of the monitor in relation to the skull and\nthe box. The box was then secured on the revolving\nstage of an assembly attached to a stereotaxic\ninstrument (fig, 26-8). By means of a laser beam, the\ndegree of tilt of the monitor off the horizontal was\nestablished by micrometers built into the assembly.\nFrom scales on the micrometers, a record of monitor\n\nw\n\nFIGURE 26-7.-Aluminum box used in securing each mouse\nhead.

The upper jaw is held in place by a rod\nsituated just behind the upper teeth and by a stiff wire\npushed across the snout.\n\ntilt was obtained. The edges of the monitor were\ncoated with a radio-opaque silver paint, and X-rays\nwere taken of each mouse head and box in three\nplanes. After the position and tilt of the monitor on\neach Apollo mouse head were thus recorded, the\nmonitors were removed for analysis. After removal\nfrom the box, the heads of the animals were\ndecalcified, then returned to the box and dehydrated\nand infiltrated with paraffin. The boxes were then\nfilled with paraffin and stored, awaiting the time that\nthe heads could be serially sectioned. For each Apollo\nmouse head, two control mouse heads were processed\nin the same way and stored for use as histological\ncontrols for the Apollo mice.\nAs indicated previously, it was necessary to introduce needles through the heads of control animals in\nthe trajectories at which cosmic ray particles had\npenetrated the subscalp monitors. To test this procedure, two \xe2\x80\x9cdummy\xe2\x80\x9d monitors were prepared and\ntemporarily placed on the skull. These monitors\nconsisted of stiff, thick paper on which the exit\n\nBIOCORE EXPERIMENT\n\nFIGURE 26-8-Mouse head in aluminum box mounted on\nrevolving stage. Turning of the micrometers will tilt the\nstage to the desired degree. A laser beam splitter is located\nat the end of the arm enclosure of the stereotaxic\ninstrument. After removal of the beam splitter, an arm\nwith a needle at its end is inserted through the holder for\n\xe2\x80\x9ctracking\xe2\x80\x9d a head.\n\n26-7\n\nand the tympanic bullae were the most dependable\nskull landmarks. Superimposition of transparencies\nrevealed that every skull previously X-rayed had\ndifferent dimensions. Hence, the position of the\nmonitor assembly on the skull had first to be\ncorrected in accordance with the distance between\nthe ridges and the bullae.\nUsing a stereotaxic instrument, four needles were\nthen run through the head in each of four control\nmice, two heads having dummy monitors and the\nother two heads having none. In the latter procedure,\nonly the measurements taken from the X-rays were\nused to plot the needle trajectories. The same\npredetermined trajectories were used for all four\nheads. The needles were left in the heads for 24 hr,\nand, as the needles were withdrawn, gouaches of\ndiffering color were placed on the skull at the needle\nentrance and exit points for identification. The heads\nwill be processed and sectioned horizontally to\nestablish reproducibility of the tracking. Two other\nheads have been \xe2\x80\x9ctracked\xe2\x80\x9d with six and eight needles,\nrespectively, to ascertain whether that many trajectories can be identified in brain sections. When the\nprocedure is fully established and the subscalp monitors from the five Apollo mice have been completely\nanalyzed, tracking of the control mouse heads will be\nperformed.\n\nSubscalp Monitor Data\npoints of four cosmic ray particles were arbitrarily\nindicated. To determine the relative position of the\nmonitors and the skull landmark differences, 20.32by 25.40-cm (8 by 10 in.) X-ray transparencies of the\nmouse heads and boxes were made (in the same\nplanes as previously mentioned). The position of the\nApollo mouse head with relation to its box had\nalready been established. In addition, it was necessary\nto establish (1) the position of the control mouse\nhead with relation to its box, (2) the relationship of\nthe Apollo mouse head to the control mouse head,\nand (3) the position of the dummy monitor in\nrelation to the control mouse box. All the measurements were accurate to 2.54 X 10dm.\nThe dummy monitor, ringed by radio-opaque\npaint, was then attached to the platform, and the\nplatform was adhered to the skull. The dummy\nmonitor was alined on the control head to within less\nthan 100 pm of the position of the corresponding\nApollo mouse monitor. Examination of the X-ray\ntransparencies indicated that the sphenoidal ridges\n\nThe monitors from all five Apollo mice have been\nexamined. For each of the monitors, the first step\nwas to remove the heat-sealed edges with a punch.\nThe paralene coating was peeled off the outer Lexan\nsurfaces, except for two monitors (from mice A-3305\nand A-3356) in which portions of the paralene\nadhered to the Lexan and could not be removed. The\ntop (farthest from the mouse head) CN layer from\nmouse A-3352 was chemically etched at 313.16 K in\n1 X lO-\xe2\x80\x99 m3 (10 ml) of 6.25N sodium hydroxide\n(NaOH) in successive stages to determine the optimum etch time for the remaining CN layers. Plastic\ntrack detectors etch preferentially along the cosmic\nray trajectories, producing cones the size of which\ndepends primarily on the particle linear. energy\ntransfer (LET), charge, and etch time. Consequently,\nan optimum etch time is one sufficiently long to\ndevelop visible cones for all high-LET particles, but\nnot so long that many tracks etch completely through\nthe CN or the Lexan layer. (Pragmatically, any\nparticle that can register in CN or Lexan is defined as\n\n26-8\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nhigh LET.) Such an etch time permits optimum\ndifferentiation of the particle tracks. A satisfactory\netch time for the CN layers was 10 hr. The top CN\nlayer from the remaining four monitors was etched\nsubsequently, and all top CN layers were scanned\nunder a light microscope. An average of 16 high-LET\ncosmic ray tracks per monitor was found in all but\nmouse A-3352. In this monitor, from the mouse that\ndied in flight, only six high-LET tracks were present.\nTracks observed in the monitors of mice A-3305 and\nA-3326 are shown in figure 26-9.\nThe surfaces of the Lexan layers were ultraviolet\n(W) irradiated: the outside surfaces for 16 hr, then\nthe inside surfaces for 32 hr, and again the outside\nsurfaces for 16 hr. This process sensitizes the plastic\nand increases the preferential etch along high-LET\nparticle trajectories. For preliminary analysis, the top\nLexan layers from mice A-3305 and A-3352 were\nchemically etched at 343.46 K in 1 X 10-\xe2\x80\x99 m3 (10\nml) of 6.25N NaOH plus 5 percent Benax, in\n\nsuccessive stages, as long as 24 hr. The preliminary\nresults indicate that some of the tracks that were\netched through in the top CN layer stopped in the\ntop Lexan layer. Successive etching of each Lexan\nlayer will be performed individually. Because of the\nvery limited size and very limited number of layers in\neach monitor, a slow, deliberate pace in processing is\nnecessary. Al layers of each monitor will be prol\ncessed and scanned. and track parameter data will be\ntaken. Then the LET, the charge group, the approximate stopping point, and the trajectory of each\ncosmic ray particle that has registered in a monitor\nwill be computed.\n\nSca I p\nThe scalps overlying the cosmic ray monitors in\nthe four living mice were obtained for study at the\ntime the subscalp monitors were removed. The\nposition of the monitors was clearly visible as an\nindentation on the undersurface of the scalps.

The top\nsurface of each monitor is at the top of each photograph. Because the tracks extended through the\nCN layer at a small angle (Le., more or less vertically) and thus were difficult to photograph in their\nentirety, the microscope stage on which they were located was tilted before photography.\nMagnification, X200; scale, 1 cm = 32.5 pm.

The hair was\ntrimmed to a length of several millimeters. The scalps\nwere processed by a standard method and serially\nsectioned at 8 p m in the coronal plane, and the\nsections were stained by hematoxylin and eosin.\nApproximately 40 percent of the first scalp (A-3400)\nhas been examined.

(a) Shown in the\ncentral part of the photograph is a hair within a hair\nfollicle. The scalp surface lies at the top of the photograph. In the bottom of the hair follicle, the hair shaft is\nswollen to approximately twice its normal diameter, is\nglobular, and has a fragmented appearance (arrow). The\nfollicular epithelium to the right of the hair shaft is\ndestroyed, as evidenced by extreme pyknosis of its nuclei.\nA few polymorphonuclear leukocytes lie in the dermis to\nthe right of the damaged part of the hair follicle. (b) The\nepidermis (at the top of the photograph) is \xe2\x80\x9cdimpled\xe2\x80\x9d\n(thinned) in the region in which several epithelial cells are\ndegenerated or dysplastic (arrow). A polymorphonuclear\nleukocyte lies in the immediately subjacent dermis. (c)\nThe top of the scalp is at the top of the photograph.\nSome epidermal cells are damaged or have disappeared\n(arrow). Twenty-one polymorphonuclear leukocytes are\nrecognizable in this photograph. At the bottom of the\nphotograph is a vein. To the left, the vein is normal. In\nthe portion of the vein in the leukocytic \xe2\x80\x9ccorridor,\xe2\x80\x9d some\nendothelial cells are swollen and polymorphonuclear\nleukocytes are adjacent to them. A small subepidermal\nvesicle is also visible (beneath the arrow).\n\n26-10\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nSCIENCE REPORT\n\n48/am in that dimension. The hair shaft is fragmented\nin the area of the lesion. The lesion is notably\n\nfour cells wide and through the entire depth of the\nepidermis. There are some small subepidermal\nvesicles\n\ndiscrete; the epithelial cells of the hair follicle above\nand below are well preserved. This feature would\nsuggest a very focal and intense injury, with a mild\ninflammatory\ncell response that signifies an antemortem reaction lasting several days.\nThe second lesion, principally\nin the epidermis\n(fig. 26-10(b)),\nextends through\nthe depth of this\nepithelial layer (in this species of mouse, the epidermis is three to four cells thick) and has a cross width\nof approximately\n80/am. Thus, in the lateral dimension of the lesion, approximately\neight epithelial cells\nshow degenerative change and the contiguous epithelial cells appear\ndysplastic.\nSeveral polymorphonuclear leukocytes are present in the adjacent under-\n\nthat presumably\ncontain edema fluid. Polymorphonuclear\nleukocytes\nare scattered\nsparsely\nin the\nunderlying dermis, but only through its outer half.\n\nlying dermis. There is no recognizable\nlesion in the\nhair follicle. The character of the tissue reaction dates\nthis lesion as antemortem.\nThe dysplastic\nepithelial\ncell reaction suggests a duration\nof at least several\ndays.\nThe epithelial component\nof the third lesion is\ncomparable to that of lesion 2. However, in addition,\nthe third lesion is characterized\nby a broad column of\npolymorphonuclear\nleukocytes extending through the\ndermis to the interface between the dermis and the\nmonitor (fig. 26-10(c)). The epidermal cells, through\nthe width of the epidermis and for a breadth of five\nto six cells, are necrotic or pyknotic, with cytoplasm\nthat stains intensely eosinophilic. Polymorphonuclear\nleukocytes (as many as 30 in a section) are columnated through the dermis in a corridor approximately\n100 /am across. A collection\nof these inflammatory\ncells is present near the lower plane of the dermis. A\nlarge, thin-walled vein borders this collection.\nWithin\nthe re#on of the corridor, the endothelial cells of this\nvein appear swollen and have hyperchromatic\nnuclei.\nThere are no visible extravasations of red blood cells.\nThe presence\nof a small subepidermal\nvesicle in\nseveral sections is interpreted\nas evidence of edema\nand supports the possibility\nthat the fragmented\npattern\nof the collagen in the underlying\ndermis is\nalso attributable,\nat least to some degree, to edema. A\nneighboring\nhair follicle\nshows\nno recognizable\nchange.\nThe fourth lesion has the same histological\nfeatures as the second and third lesions. Generally, the\nfourth lesion is intermediate\nin severity between these\ntwo. The epidermal changes are again characterized\nby necrosis of epithelial cells in a segment three to\n\nRetina\nThe left eyes of two Apollo mice (A-3400 and\nA-3356)\nwere removed\nat autopsy\nand fixed by\nimmersion\nin glutaraldehyde.\nExamination\nthus far\nhas revealed no significant alterations\nin the retina.\nThe remaining\neyes were left in situ and will be\navailable\nfor examination\nwhen the entire head is\nserially sectioned.\nViscera\nLung Tissue.-Lung\ntissue was obtained from the\nfour surviving Apollo mice, from four control mice\nthat had been perfused with FAM in Samoa, from the\nfive backup mice from KSC, and from several mice\nthat had been subjected\nto high oxygen pressure\n(8.3 X 104 N/m 2 absolute (12 psia)) over a period of\n7 days.\nImmediately\nfollowing perfusion of the mice on\nSamoa, the tissue was placed in 6 percent glutaraldehyde. On return to ARC, the specimens were postfixed 1 hr in 1 percent buffered osmium, dehydrated\nin acetone,\nand embedded\nin low-viscosity\nplastic.\nThin sections were cut for examination\nunder the\nelectron\nmicroscope.\nThe FAM perfusion\nhad destroyed all ultrastructural\ndetail except the outer cell\nmembranes\nand the nuclear membrane.\nThe finding\nof cytoplasmic\nrarefaction,\nblebbing,\nor blistering\nwould be highly suspect under these conditions.\nBecause interpretation\nof sections\nby electron\nmicroscopy\nwas impractical,\nthe plastic embedded\nblocks were sectioned at 1 /am for light microscopy.\nA special\nsilver method\ndeveloped\nin the ARC\nlaboratory\nfor plastic-embedded\nspecimens was used\n(ref. 26-12). In sections thus prepared,\na minimal\namount of perivascular\nedema was noted as well as\nsome blistering and blebbing of the alveolar epithelial\ncells and the capillary\nendothelial\ncells. The latter\ntype of change, especially, indicates excess fluid and\nis known to be widespread in oxygen-poisoned\nlungs.\nPreliminary\ninvestigation\nhas not revealed any major\ndamage\nto the alveolar walls or any significant\namount\nof alveolar exudate.\nSome changes in the\nbronchiolar\n\nepithelium\n\nhave been\n\nnoted,\n\nbut these\n\nBIOCORE EXPERIMENT\nwere not specific, and somewhat similar changes\nappeared on occasion in control pocket mice.\nThe five backup mice (from the SIN 05 canister)\nwere perfused with FAM, stored in 10 percent neutral\nFormalin, and subsequently processed in paraffin for\nlight microscopy. Moreover, a few small pieces of\nlung tissue were embedded in plastic so that sections\ncould be cut at 1 pm in thickness and stained with\nsilver for comparison. From what has been observed\nin these pocket mice and in the Apollo mice, there\nseems to be some indication of an increased fluid load\nin both series. Because all these animals (i.e., in both\ncanisters) were living in an almost pure oxygen\natmosphere, these indications of fluid buildup were\nnot surprising. However, no major damage or any\nindication that these animals were suffering from\n\xe2\x80\x9coxygen poisoning\xe2\x80\x9d were seen. In fact, the mice\nin oxygen test runs seemed rather resistant to\noxygen effects. Electron microscopy of the lungs\nafter 7 days of exposure to oxygen at a pressure of\n8.3 X IO4 N/m2 absolute (12 psia) in a test run\nrevealed remarkably little damage. There was some\nblebbing of the capillary endothelial cells and some\nfluid and debris in a few alveoli. Tissue for this study\nwas clipped from ligated, nonperfused lungs and fixed\nby immersion in glutaraldehyde, then postfixed in\nosmium. Satisfactory ultrastructural detail was therefore possible. Light microscopy of these lungs is yet\nto be performed. More intensive study is planned to\nclarify some of the questionable areas. Some of the\nchanges are minimal and some are found in both\nexperimental and control animals. In these instances,\nquantitation is necessary to determine whether the\nchanges are significant.\nLiver.-The livers were examined without knowledge of which came from the Apollo mice and which\ncame from the nine control mice perfused on Samoa.\nThe livers of numerous oxygenexposed and normal\ncontrol mice also were studied. Serial sectioning of\nthe livers was performed, and the sections were\nstained with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) hematoxylin\nand orange G. In one liver (which turned out to be\nthat of Apollo mouse A-3305), an examination was\nmade of 400 serial sections ( 5 pm thick) on 60 slides\nalternately stained by PAS and the Giemsa method.\nThe liver of one Apollo mouse (A-3356) was regarded\nas normal and thus was classed as from a \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d\nmouse.\nIn some livers (mouse numbers not specified),\nmitotic figures were seen in scattered endothelial cells\n\n26-1 1\n\nor reticuloendothelial cells; they were seen in all\nsections of these livers in the absence of any other\nchange. Mitotic figures were also found in and around\nlarge areas of focal necrosis and repair. Certain other\nchanges were found in the livers of animals, some of\nwhich were classed as \xe2\x80\x9ccontrols.\xe2\x80\x9d A field is shown in\nfigure 26-1 1. The enlargement of the hepatic nuclei\n(nuclear \xe2\x80\x9cballooningyy)and of the entire hepatic cell\nis considered a nonspecific degenerative change found\nin normal aged mice and, in an exaggerated form\n(accelerated aging perhaps), in animals exposed to\nphoton radiation. Hepatic nuclear and cellular enlargement accompanied by mitosis, such as shown in\nfigure 26-1 1, has previously been observed (by the\ninvestigators) only in animals exposed to large doses\nof gamma radiation. The presence of red blood cells\nwithin liver cells appears to be a new finding. It is\npostulated that the intracellular hemorrhage may be\ntraumatic in origin and may be due to fluctuations in\nintra-abdominal pressure occurring in association with\nfluctuations in ambient pressure in test canisters. Of\nspecial interest were the alterations classed as \xe2\x80\x9cfocal\nhepatic necrosis and repair.\xe2\x80\x9d These alterations were\nfound only in four (of a total of 40) mice: in three\nApollo mice (A-3326, A-3400, and A-3305) and in\none control mouse autopsied on Samoa (A-3494).\n\nFIGURE 26-1 1.-Photomicrograph of liver from control\nmouse A-3282.

C. Lushbaugh and G .\nHumason, Oak Ridge.)\n\n26-1 2\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nIn half the liver of Apollo mouse A-3305, 16\nlesions were identified. (The other half of the liver\nwent to another investigator.) The lesions were round\nor slightly oval. Fields are shown in figure 26-12. In\nevolution, the initial stage of the pathological process\nis regarded as a coagulative necrosis. The necrotic\ncells are chemotactic for polymorphonuclear leukocytes and become heavily infiltrated by them. The\nlargest lesion in this necrotic state (approximately\n600 pm in the greatest dimension) is shown in figure\n26-12(a). In this instance, the lesion seems to\nsurround a thrombosed vein. The central area of the\nlesion is partly liquefied and is hemorrhagic and\ninfiltrated by inflammatory cells. The dead cells are\nfinally completely lysed away. A central amorphous\nacidophilic mass of unknown nature surrounded by\nhistiocytes, fibroblasts, and other cells is shown in\nfigure 26-1 2@). However, unlike most inflammatory\ngranulomas, there is no circumferential fibrotic mass.\n\nMitotic figures are present in unidentifiable small\nconnective tissue cells, but collagen is not produced\n(fig. 26-12(c)).\nOther Tissues.-Many other tissues of the mice are\nbeing investigated; however, not enough observations\nhave been made to warrant reports at this time.\n\nFindings in Nonsurviving Mouse\nMicroscopic examination of the Apollo mouse that\ndied (A-3352) revealed that the organs and viscera\nhad undergone advanced autolysis. In the lungs, there\nappeared to be an abnormally large number of\ndesquamated, hypertrophied alveolar macrophages,\nsuggesting the possibility of antemortem pulmonary\ninflammation (pneumonitis). The cause of the inflammation was not evident, nor could the cause of death\nbe established. From the amount of food consumed\n(9.9 g), it is estimated that death occurred 9 to 12\n\nFIGURE 26-12.-Photomicrographs from liver of Apollo\nmouse A - 3 3 0 5 (from C. C. Lushbaugh and G.

Bailey b\n\nThe Apollo 17 mission was the fourth mission\nduring which an investigation of the so-called light\nflash phenomenon\nwas conducted.\nDuring the Apollo\n14 and 15 missions,\n1-hr observing sessions were\ndesignated\nfor the crewmen\nto darken\nthe cabin\n(blindfolds\nused on Apollo 15) and to look for the\nphenomena.\nTheir observations\nwere reported in real\ntime. The Apollo light flash moving emulsion detector (ALFMED) flown on Apollo 16 provided the first\n\nevent) rate of one event per observer every 3.1 min,\nthis 17-min "dead time" indicates that the crewman\nhad to be very well dark adapted\nto observe the\nphenomenon.\nAll the crewmen have reported\nrelative ease in\ndistinguishing\nthe eye in which the events occurred\n(table 27-1). The most common\nevent type (63\npercent) is the point or starlike flash that has also\nbeen described as a "nova." Next (25 percent) is the\n"streak."\nIn almost all cases, the streaks have a sense\nof motion or direction; that is, a streak might appear\nto be "moving"\nfrom right to left rather\nthan\nappearing as a motionless\nhorizontal\nline. However,\nthe motion\nis almost\n"instantaneous"\nand may\noriginate from shape cues (ref. 27-2). The streaks,\nwhich have been described as "sharp and distinct" by\nsome observers and "fuzzy and diffuse" by others,\nare virtually always straight. Some of the streaks have\nbeen described as having a gap in the middle. The\nt\'mal distinct event type (6 percent) was described as\na "cloud."\nThese events were seen as a "dull flash,"\n\nopportunity\nto record the passage of cosmic rays\nthrough the crewman\'s head and eyes and to correlate\nthem with his observations\n(ref. 27-1).\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 PROTOCOL\n\nThe two 60-min observing\nsessions during the\nApollo 17 mission were scheduled\nexactly as the\nsessions had been for Apollo 16. The first session was\nconducted\nduring translunar\ncoast (TLC) and the\nsecond during transearth\ncoast (TEC). During the\nTLC session, the command module pilot (CMP) wore\nthe ALFMED\nand the commander\n(CDR) wore a\nblindfold.\nThe lunar module pilot (LMP) transcribed\nthe comments\nof the other crewmen. During the TEC\nsession,\nall three\ncrewmen\nwore\nblindfolds.\nAll\ncomments from both sessions were recorded.\n\nANALYSIS\nAND\n\nOF\n\nEVENT\n\nwere always in the periphery of the visual field, and\nhad no distinguishable\nshape. They have been compared to the flash seen when lightning\ndischarges\ninside a cloud. The remaining 6 percent of the events\nwere composites of the other events, such as two stars\nsimultaneously\nor a star and a cloud simultaneously.\nThe LMP on the Apollo\n14 mission\nadded the\nfollowing comments.\n"My experience is that even the\nso-called\nstar, the supernova,\nis not as clear a\nphenomenon\nor clear a picture as I had in mind that\nthey would appear. There still seemed to be at least\ntwo flashes, maybe a bright flash, followed an instant\nlater by a more subdued flash, or perhaps a halo-like\neffect-there\ndoes not seem to be a set pattern in each\ncase. Sometimes it\'s a very clear single flash; at times\nit seems followed by a halo. Sometimes\nit seems\nfollowed by an adjacent\nflash." The mean times\nbetween events per observer for those events occurring after the first event was seen (i.e., after the\n\nRATES\n\nDESCRIPTIONS\n\nEvent descriptions\nfrom all the light flash observing sessions are listed in table 27-1.

The fact that dark adaptation is necessary indicates that the phenomenon is strongly\nconnected with the retina rather than with a direct\nstimulation in the optic nerve or in any other part of\nthe central nervous system. Therefore, the list of\n\npossibilities is narrowed to those capable of stimulating the retina when the observer\'s eyes are closed (ref.\n27-3). Because the crewmen are exposed to cosmic\nrays and because ionizing radiation has been demonstrated to be capable of producing the same type of\neffect, the most probable explanation of the phenomenon is that it is caused by cosmic rays penetrating the eyes and retinas of the observers. Several\nmechanisms by which the charged particles stimulate\nthe retina have been suggested. Among these mechanisms are direct ionization, Cerenkov radiation, and\nfluorescence (refs. 27-3 and 27-4).\nAnother interesting characteristic of the phe-\n\n27-4\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nnomenon (table 27-11) is that the mean time between\nevents and the dark adaptation times are uniformly\nlonger for the TEC sessions than for the TLC sessions.\nGenerally, fewer events are seen and a longer dark\nadaptation period is required during the TEC sessions\nthan during the TLC sessions. Because the effect\ngreatly exceeds any probable statistical errors, it is\nquite certain that a real effect has been observed.\nThere are, as yet, no physical arguments that can\nexplain this \xe2\x80\x9ctransearth coast depression.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact,\nmost arguments tend to indicate a greater rate during\nTEC because the lunar module is no longer blocking a\nlarge part of the sky and the tank levels of the\nconsumables are lower, thus providing less shielding.\nThe only theory remaining is that the ability of the\ncrewmen to dark adapt and the time required to do\nso has been impaired by some parameters of the\nmission (e.g., prolonged exposure to zero gravity,\ndiet, fatigue, etc.). This theory is challenged by the\ncrewmen, who claim general alertness and no other\nevidence of any loss of visual acuity. However, all the\ncrewmen have indicated the subjective impression\nthat the light flashes seemed less frequent and more\nsubdued during the TEC sessions. Two extreme\nexamples occurred. The more extreme example of the\nTEC depression occurred on Apollo 17 when none of\nthe three crewmen were able to see even a single\nevent during the 60-min TEC session, when two\ncrewmen had seen a total of 27 events during the\nTLC session. (The LMP did not participate in the\nApollo 17 TLC session.) The only other inability to\nobserve the phenomenon occurred on the Apollo 16\nmission when the CMP reported he was unable to\nobserve even a single event at any time during the\nentire mission. The Apollo 16 CMP was the only\nApollo crewmember who was briefed to look for the\nphenomenon but failed to see it. However, he has said\nthat he does have relatively poor night vision, which\nmay have a bearing on his inability to see the\nphenomena. Some of these questions may be\nanswered more definitively when the final analysis of\nthe ALFMED data is complete.\n\nA LF M E D DESC R I PTION\nThe ALFMED is an electromechanical device that\nis worn on the head somewhat like a helmet and\nsupports cosmic-radiation-sensitiveemulsions around\nthe head of the test subject (figs. 27-1 to 274). A\ndirect physical record is provided of cosmic ray\n\nFIGURE 27-l.-Exterior view of ALFMED device.\n\nFIGURE 27-2.-Interior view of ALFMED device.\n\nparticles that pass through the emulsion plates and, in\nturn, through the head of the subject. The ALFMED\ncontains two sets of glass plates coated on both sides\nwith special nuclear emulsion and supported in a\nprotective framework. One set of nuclear emulsion\nplates is fured in position within the headset and\nsurrounds the front and sides of the head. A second\nsimilar set of plates is located exterior and parallel to\nthe inner fixed plates and may be translated at a\nconstant rate (10 pmlsec) with respect to the fwed\nplates. This configuration provides a time resolution\nfor events to within 1 sec. The total translation time\n\nVISUAL LIGHT FLASH PHENOMENON\n\n27-5\n\nFIGURE 274.-View of ALFMED device emulsion plates.\n\nlr\n\n*\n\nFIGURE 27-3.-The ALFMED\xe2\x80\x98device as worn by crewmen.\n\navailable is 60 min, after which the moving plates\nmay be returned to the original or \xe2\x80\x9cfiducial\xe2\x80\x9d position.\n\nALFMED DATA ANALYSIS PROCEDURE\nThe analysis of the ALFMED plates proceeds\nthrough the following steps.\n1. Location scan-The moving plate is placed on\na special microscope stage containing the fixed plate\nand is then oriented in the fiducial position (i.e., the\nrelative orientation and translation of the plates\nduring stowage) (fig. 27-4). The plates are then\nscanned for tracks that do not line up properly in\nthat plate position (i.e., tracks that occurred while\nthe plates were moving).\n2. Translation scan-For all the candidate events\nlocated in the first step, a scan along the line of translation is made to locate the counterpart track. A measurement of the translation distance for each event is\nalso made. This measurement yields the time of occurrence of the event.\n3. Charge and energy measurement-The indi-\n\nvidual tracks are subjected to a detailed analysis to\ndetermine the charge and energy of the particle (refs.\n27-5 and 27-6).\n4. Trajectory measurement-The direction of the\ntrack is measured, and the subsequent trajectory\nthrough the head is predicted.\n5. Correlation with observations-The list of\nevents is compared with the observations reported by\nthe crewmen in an attempt to determine if cosmic\nrays do in fact cause the phenomenon; if there is an\napparent charge, energy, or linear energy transfer\n(LET) threshold; or if some particular event types\ncorrelate with certain particle types (e.g., streaks\ncaused by tracks tangent to the retina, etc.).\nScanning of both the Apollo 16 and 17 ALFMED\nplates has proceeded slowly and no preliminary data\nare yet available.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe ALFMED data should provide verification\nthat cosmic rays are indeed the source of the\nphenomena and also information about apparent\nthresholds (in cosmic ray parameters). However, all\nthe data that will be available from the Apollo light\nflash investigation can only yield likely clues as to the\nreason for the TEC light flash depression.\n\n27-6\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nREFERENCES\n\n27-1.

And it is, although cratered, when\nyou see it at the terminator, it is smoother than the mare;\nthat is, it does not seem to have the swell, the sea swell\ncharacteristics or ridges or any other features other than the\ncraters superimposed on it. (LMP, rev 5)\nAn observation that I think is significant is that most of\nthe 3@km craters on the far side of the Moon seem to be\nfairly fresh. By fresh, I mean you do not have any real\ndefinite ray pattern to them, but streaked, 45\' slope on the\ncrater walls. On the bottom of the crater is a flat floor, or\nsometimes there is a domical type (domed up) floor. And the\ndomical floor does not resemble anything like what slumped\ndown the sides. (CMP, rev 27)\n\nFew additional comments were made during the\nfight concerning the light plains materials. However,\napart from the aforementioned characteristics, little\ncould be added that would resolve the problem of\ntheir origin:\nPasteur and Hilbert make a pair of big craters that we\nspent some time studying. . . Both appear to be very old,\nmuch older than Tsiolkovsky and they have a plain*formhg\nffl, very flat looking at this distance, and very light colored.\nIt is an event on the Moon of which we have relatively little\nunderstanding at this time, but possibly the Apollo 16\nresults, when they are fully known, through the analysis of\nthe samples and other data, may shed some light on that\nevent.

This\nZond 8 metric photograph of Aitken Crater (150 km in diameter) represents the same view of the\ncrater as that seen by the Apollo 1 7 crew.\n\nGEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS FROM LUNAR ORBIT\n\n28-5\n\nAITKEN\nAitken Crater, 150 km in diameter, is one of the\nfew craters that display a dark mare-like floor.\nObservations were made to better understand the\ncrater and its surroundings, the dark floor material,\nand the many interesting small-scale features in the\nfloor (fig. 28-4).\nThe rim crest of Aitken Crater is very sharp and its\nsecondary crater chains are distinct. However, it was\nnot possible from the available photographs to\nestablish without doubt whether or not the rm\ni\ndeposits are brighter than the surrounding highlands.\nWhen the Ch4F\xe2\x80\x99 was queried about this particular\naspect, he replied:\nThe rim deposits are a little bit brighter than the\nsurrounding area. Where you would put it [place the crater in\nthe lunar stratigraphic time scale] is probably early\nEratosthenian. It is definitely not Copernican because I\ncannot see, a t least at that low Sun, I cannot see any rays\naround it. But probably Eratosthenian-or somewhere in that\narea-because of the fresh slumping; it is not subdued at all.\nThe walls of the crater themselves are not subdued. They are\nfairly fresh, but not as fresh as to be Copernican. And it\nseems to me like it was brighter at the higher Sun angles\naround there [on earlier revs], which indicates that there\nwould still be some remnants of a bright rim around it.\nOn the side of crater Aitken, there are no visible rays that\nI can see at this low Sun angle. There is definitely a mare\nfloor in there. It is a dark, low-albedo-type flat floor with\nswirls in it; no definite [topographic] expression to the\nswirls. One thing that is quite apparent is a flow scarp in the\nnortheast corner, coming out of a little cloverleaf-like area. I\nam going to have to look the next pass over it to see if the\nsouth domical structure that is in there is breached. And I\ncannot tell whether the material is flowing t o the east out of\nthat domical structure or if it is flowing into the domical\nstructure. (CMP, rev 27)\n\nWhen the CMP was queried at that time whether\nor not he was able to distinguish high lava marks on\nthe lower part of the crater wall, he replied:\nThe lava mark is what I would call a lava scarp in the\nnortheast corner. There are some lava marks along the central\npeak. They are not nearly as apparent as the one up in the\nnortheast corner. In the northeast corner is definitely a f o\nlw\nfront, a lava flow front, that [laps up against] the older\ninterior wall of the crater. (CMP, rev 27)\n\nSome of the craters in the floor of Aitken,\ninformally named on Apollo 17 the \xe2\x80\x9ccloverleaf\ncluster ,\xe2\x80\x9d display domical structures of unknown\norigin (fig. 28-5). An attempt was made to determine\nwhether information could be gathered relative to the\n\nFIGURE 28-5.-Cluster of small craters (4 to 8 km in\ndiameter) in the floor of Aitken Crater.

Maybe a little bit lighter, a\nlittle bit lighter than the surrounding material. Of course, it is\ndefinitely lighter than the floor. The floor itself, is\n[somewhat] tan.

In other words, the floor, to me,\nis kind of a standard flat mare floor. And I have to compare\nthe texture of the domical hills to what I would imagine is\nsome of the dacite flows that I have seen out in California,\nthe heavy viscous-type flows.. . Well, I am pretty sure they\nhave got to be volcanic in origin. (CMP, 28)\nrev\n\nTSI 0 LKOVSKY\nThe 200-km crater Tsiolkovsky was studied\nthoroughly on the Apollo 15 mission, and the results\nof these observations are available in references 28- 1\nand 28-4. On Apollo 17, further study was made of\nthe crater and its many interesting features, especially\nthe flow-like units on the northeast part of the crater\nrim (fig. 28-6 and 28-7).\nThe visual of Tsiolkovsky is hopefully pretty much\nrecorded on the recorder. In summary, I concentrated\nprimarily on the flow up in the northeast corner. To me, that\nparticular piece in the crater on picture Tsiolkovsky, 4 of 5\n[fig. 28-7(a)]. The piece that is down in the crater is on the\nright-hand side of the page, [must have been] in somewhat of\na molten state. It looks like it is a landslide that has slid down\nthe wall of the crater and was detached from the molten\nmaterial, the rough-looking material that\'s on the rim of the\ncrater Tsiolkovsky. (CMP, rev 64)\n\nA similar flow unit occurs on the southern rim of\nthe crater Tsiolkovsky. This unit apparently originated at a graben bounded by two parallel faults on\nthe rim and flowed into the crater Waterman (ref.\n28-1). The two units were thought t o be similar in\nnature:\nThe flow that goes down into Waterman. . . I did not get\na chance to look at until I got to the west of i t . . . But the\nmaterial that is in the floor of the crater Waterman is the\nsame type of material as that in the little flow on the\nnortheast corner. (CMP, rev 64)\n\nThe lineated unit on the northwest rim of\nTsiolkovsky Crater was interpreted as a landslide on\nApollo 15. One of the problems was the fact that\nthere appeared to be a larger crater population on\nthat unit than on the older floor materials of Fermi\nCrater (ref. 28-1). More information was required to\nfully understand this and the detailed characteristics\nof these small craters:\nIn the first observation of the mass of material that goes\nout into the crater Fermi, it looks like there is a whole bunch\nof craters in there that are essentially rimless. However, on\nclose examination with the binoculars, I could not see any\nthat did not have at least a slight indication of a rim. The\nrims were essentially very subdued. They extended out to\nabout a half a crater diameter; and these are the craters in the\n\nFIGURE 28-6.-Tsiolkovsky Crater (200 km in diameter) and its surroundings (Lunar Orbiter 111 frame\n121-M).\n\nGEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS FROM LUNAR ORBIT\n\nTSIOLKOVSKY (4 OF 5)\n\n(a)\n\nExomine the flow unit on the northeast rim of Tsiolkovsky:\n1. look for a source (fractures or vents).\n2.

The central peak was also\ndescribed in much the same way as on Apollo 15,\nincluding the sightings of large block fields atop and\nnear the base of the peaks. Marks on the central peak\nindicating a \xe2\x80\x9chigh lava mark\xe2\x80\x9d were also sighted in two\nplaces:\nThere seems to be high lava marks around the western and\nnorthern sides of the central peak. For some reason, it is not\nevident or visible on the south side of the central peak. Also,\nthere seems to be high lava marks on the raised portion of the\nfloor on the contact between the dark material on the floor\nand the lighter, rough-looking unit on the northern side of\nthe crater.

The name\nArabia was recommended for the basin to the\nCommittee on Nomenclature of the International\nAstronomical Union (IAU). After discussions concerning the newly adopted rules of the IAU, the name\nAl-Khwarizmi was substituted (ref. 28-9).

We are right over a concentration of these now in the northern part of Marginis, where the\nrule is that the light areas are associated\nwith either\nsymmetrically\naround a much darker area than the normal\nmare, or on one side, and in this case, generally the south\nside. That rule is very clear. And that also seems to hold in\nthe far side where there was a slightly darker region between\nareas of light-colored swirls. (LMP, rev 2)\nHouston,\nthere seem to be two general kinds of ray\npatterns: those associated with a lot of secondaries and those\nthat have no visible secondaries.\nAnd that is independent,\nyet, from the irregular\nlight-colored\nareas we have been\ncalling swirls. There is a lot more of that light-colored\nswirl-like irregular material, or discoloration,\nor whatever you\nwant to call it, in the far-side highlands, particularly\nas we\napproach Marginis, than I have previously gathered from the\navailable photography.\n(LMP, rev 3)\nLet me reiterate something that I have been watching this\nrevolution;\nthat is this relationship\nof the light-colored\nor\nlight-gray swirl patterns on the surface to associated patterns\nor parallel patterns\nthat are darker than the average of the\nsurrounding area. And this is true both in Mare Marginis and\nin most cases on the far side. Although\nthese are very\nirregular patterns,\nthere is roughly a concentric\nzoning of\ndark to light within an intermediate\nalbedo surface. There are\nvariations\non that theme; sometimes\nyou do not get the\nsymmetry\nquite as good, but it is common enough that I\nthink it is worth noting. (LMP, rev 5)\n\nLater during the mission, the CMP made additional observations of this extensive swirl field. The\nalternating bands of dark and light were obvious\ndespite the variation in Sun elevation angle. When he\nwas queried about the swirls west of the crater Abul\nWafa (fig. 28-8), he stated:\n\n2)\n\nYes, I really saw them that time. And where the swirls\nreally show up is about a crater diameter from Firsov, crater\ndiameter to the east. And I talked about it on the tape. But,\nbasically, they are kind of concentric swirls in that area, with\nlight and dark [bands].\nAnd the contrast between the light\nand dark is something\ntremendous.\nThe dark is not a mare\ndark, but a tan that comes real close to it. (CMP, rev 29)\nYou could really see the swirls in Marginis; [I am] trying\nto compare them with the same type of swirls back there in\nArabia...\nBut in the case of Marginis, there is a crater\n[Goddard]\njust in the northwest\nquarter...\nThat is what is\ncausing all the swirls going across Marginis...\nThere is a dark\ngray, and the swirls seem to be around the dark-gray areas.\nThe swirls are a light tan.

The CMP was asked to\nstudy these relationships within the basin and report\non the color tone of the mare materials:\nI am looking at the eastern edge of Crisium now. As you\ncome across there, it looks a little bit darker; I keep seeing\nbrowns all the time up here instead of gray tones. Maybe that\nis just the way I interpret them. They have kind of a\nbrownish tint to them, and it is a darker brown than south of\nthe ridge system there.

(CMP, rev 2 8 )\n\n.\n\nPicard Crater\nPicard Crater, 30 km in diameter, is located in\nwestern Mare Crisium and displays a somewhat dark\nrim (fig. 28-13). Although the crater appears to be\nyounger than the surrounding mare material, there\nare no rays and crater chains associated with its\nrelatively smooth ejecta blanket. Detailed study of its\ncharacteristics from orbit was planned to aid in\ndeciphering its origin. The similar, but smaller, Peirce\nCrater to the north was also studied for the same\nreason. The most obvious first question was related to\nthe color of their rim deposits relative to the\nsurrounding mare:\nAll those dark and light albedo changes around Picard and\nPeirce are not obvious at this particular angle yet. There is\nsome hint of them.. .We are just about over the top of\nPicard; and the rim materials, which go out about a third of a\ncrater diameter, as near as I can tell, are distinctly darker but\nnot by much. They are more gray than the gray tan, or\ntannish gray of the rest of the mare. (LMP, rev 1)\nComing up a t Picard now. Looking at it, a little bit from a\ndistance, there is a darker albedo that goes about one-half a\ncrater diameter. And then, on top of that darker albedo, it\n\nFIGURE 28-13.-Picard\n(AS 17-15C-23038).\n\nCrater in western Mare Crisium\n\nonly goes out maybe a fourth of a crater diameter, there is a\nlighter-type material that seems to be covering it up. The\nlighter-type material though only goes in a generally westerly,\nfrom the south around to the west side and then from the\nnortheast around to the northwest side, and it leaves the dark\nmaterial draping down on the east side of Picard.\nYou can pretty well carry a light layer in the top portion\nof the wall all the way around to that part where the light\npart stops. And then you come to a dark layer again. And\nthen, as you continue around from the west to go to the\nnorth side, it is a little bit in shadow on the east side, so I\ncannot tell for sure whether that light layer is in there or not.\nBut starting on the south side, going around to the west\nagain, you can see a layer of dark material, although there\ndoes not seem to be a change in the slope or the inner wall of\nthe crater.\nJust below the dark layer, there is a change in slope a little\nbit. It maintains that slope all the way down to the crater\nfloor, where you get into the slump blocks. And then in the\ncenter of the crater, it looks like a mare-like fill with, I am\nabout to lose sight of it again, something comparable to a\ncentral peak in it. (CMP, rev 24)\n\nWhen queried as to whether or not the Crisium\nmare ridge system corresponds to the color boundary,\nand if not, does the ridge cross any color boundaries,\nthe CMP stated:\nThis ridge system is running east and west down here. The\ncolor boundary is not nearly as apparent in Crisium as it is in\nSerenitatis, except that right under me right now, there is a\n\nGEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS FROM LUNAR ORBIT\n\n28-15\n\nsubdued crater with a southern part of a ridge. The ridge runs\neast-west, and it looks like we have got a flow coming out of\nit . . .The zero-phase point is following me right along here in\nCrisium, so I get a different color straight out from the\nwindow than I do out from the edge of it. So I think that is\ngoing to influence my thinking.\nYou can see some of the rays from the crater Proclus have\nspread out all the way across here. And they completely\ncover up the ridge system, so I cannot see any color\ndistinction on the western edge of Crisium. (CMP, rev 27)\n\nSmall, dark-halo craters in Mare Crisium.\n-The\nmare surface northwest of Yerkes Crater includes\nseveral dark-halo craters (fig. 28-14). Some of these\ndisplay smooth rim deposits and are believed to be\nvolcanic in origin (ref. 28-13), and others have\nhummocky ejecta blankets and are probably produced by impact. The following observations were\nmade from orbit during the Apollo 17 mission.\n\nOn the following revolution, the color tones\naround and within Picard Crater were again and more\nfully described:\n\nWest of Yerkes, there is a real small crater I am looking at\nwith the binoculars. And the reason it stands out is because it\nis a fresh crater and yet there is a dark halo all the way\naround it. And it is also dark down on the inside of it. I still\n\nSure hope that color difference shows up in Picard. . .\nThere is black material now you get on up here, the darker\ntannish-gray material covers essentially from the east all the\nway around to the south. It goes outside the rim as well as\ninside the rim. It drapes over the rim. That cannot be a\nshadow effect. (CMP, rev 28)\n\nAdditional details of the crater and its surroundings were also obtained on later revolutions:\nYou know you could, even as the zero phase went right\nacross Picard, you could still see the darkness on the east\nfrom 9 o\xe2\x80\x99clock around to 6 o\xe2\x80\x99clock, if north is zero. And if\nnorth is zero as you look at the crater, then over about 1\no\xe2\x80\x99clock there is some kind of a fault zone in the side of the\nr m and that is another spot where the dark material drapes\ni,\ndown into the rim and also outside of the rim. And then you\nhave that same type of impression at about 11 o\xe2\x80\x99clock. You\nhave got a black streak going down inside the r m and then it\ni,\nwidens out going toward a little crater outside of the r m\ni.\n(CMP, rev 36)\nIn the eastern wall of Picard-I am looking at it with the\nbinoculars now-you can definitely see the fust part of it up\nthere has some vertical escarpments along the edge. And the\nvertical escarpments are in irregular layers, just like you\nwould suspect if you eroded out a bunch of lava layers. In\nother words, they are discontinuous, but they are kind of\nintermingled along, and they go about a third of the way\ndown from the top of the rim, down to where the talus starts\nsliding into the crater. (CMP, rev 40)\n\nAt a Sun angle of 5 \xe2\x80\x99 to 55\xe2\x80\x99 (rev 5 ) the crater\n0\n0,\nPicard still displays a dark halo. The dark halo\nappears slightly smaller, extending perhaps to one\ncrater diameter, and is less distinct. (Paraphrased\nfrom CMP, rev 50)\n\nWestern Crisium\n\nIn the western part of the Crisium basin, observations were made of (1) the dark-halo craters in the\nmare fill and (2) the rim materials as displayed in\nmassif units and in the ejecta blanket, including\nProclus Crater and its bright rays.\n\nFIGURE 28-14.-Dark-halo craters in western Mare Crisium.\nThe ejecta blanket of the circled crater was described as\nhaving an orange-tinted color (AS17-150-23044).\n\n28-16\n\nAPOLLO\n17PRELIMINARY\nSCIENCE\nREPORT\n\ndonot ave\nh afeeling\nforthe\nrelative ofthings. try\nsize\nI will\ntogethat onthe pass. rev\nt one\nnext (CMP, 24)\nAll theseark-halo by Yerkes! one\nd\ncraters\nThe thatis\nfarthest thesouth likeanimpact-type In\nto\nlooks\ncrater.\nother ords, have definite blanket\nw\nyou a\nejecta\naround\nit.\nThe thatshard\none i\ntolook\natisinthe\nmiddle field,\nofthe\nbutI think isprobably second down the\nit\nthe\none from top.\nIt has\nrounded and\nridges, arounded The\nrim. ejecta\npattern\northe halo\ndark isabout the\ntwice crater\ndiameter. it is\nAnd\neither highly\na\neroded\nimpact-type or it is a\ncrater,\nvolcanic-type And,o me, doesotlook\nstructure. t\nit\nn\nlikea\nhighly impact (CMP, 40)\neroded one. rev\nThe raysand ejectablanketsurrounding\nthe\nbright-rayed\ncraterin the area(fig. 28-14)were\ndescribed\nas\norange color. he\nin\nT crater as\nw compared\ntoothers theTaurus-Littrow\nin\nlandingite in the\ns and\nSulpicius_ area\nGallus (asdiscussedthefollowing\nin\nparagraphs).\nIn the north, east, and west quadrants of that little crater,\nthere is very clearly an orange pattern, an orange color to the\nejecta.

And I have not seen any\naround Crisium yet.\nA crater, a fresh crater in the mare or a fresh crater in the\nrim area will have boulders, do not misunderstand\nme. But the\nfront faces, the ring front faces, do not have boulders that I\ncan see. And I think boulders are pretty obvious when they\nare there.

(CMP, rev 38)\n\nThe same color differences were amplified and\nmore fully described at higher Sun angles (25"\nhigher):\nThis is not a good viewing attitude at all, but we get a few\nisolated views that may be worth commenting on. The\ncontrast, to my eye anyway, between the three color units\naround the landing site is a medium bluish gray to gray for\nthe dark mantle; a light blue gray for the annulus around\nSerenitatis; and then, a tan gray for Mare Serenitatis proper.\nThe light-blue-gray annulus is also the locus of most of the\ncircumferential grabens, that Serenitatis is noted for, in that\narea. And that is nothing new! But, in one place, there is a\nvery subdued, flooded crater which seems to control a\ncircular projection of the light blue gray out over the tan-gray\nmare. Most of the major wrinkle ridge system of Serenitatis,\nof course, is outside the annulus of blue gray, except locally,\nand one of those places was to the west of the TaurusLittrow site. Although that wrinkle ridge system does, in the\nsouthern portions of Serenitatis, cross the contact between\nthe light blue gray and the tan gray.\nThe impression I have had by looking at all the mare\nwrinkle ridge systems is that they are a late feature. They, at\nleast at low Sun, and sometimes even at high Sun, they have\nvery sharply defined ridges with steep slopes on either side\nthat, in general, give me the impression that they are\nconstructional, possibly associated with some thrusting movement. (LMP, rev 62)\n\nSouthern Mare Serenitatis. -An interesting observation was made of apparent layering in Dawes Crater\n(fig. 28-17) that is related to the units in southern\nMare Serenitatis and their color boundaries:\nThe crater Dawes has, starting from the top going down\nthe rim, a light-tan layer; it is a concentric layer all the way\naround. And then you come into a lighter one, almost like on\nthe hills all around the landing site. The first layer goes down\nmaybe about a third of the depth; and then the white\n\nFIGURE 28-17.-Layering in Dawes Crater on the southeastern corner of Mare Serenitatis as seen from lunar orbit\n(AS17-150-23066).\nconcentric layer, in the western wall, goes down to not quite\nhalf of the distance from the top of the rim down to the\nbottom. The lower portion, a little better than a half, is kind\nof a tannish gray. It is all streaked. And the bottom of the\ncrater itself is filled with, oddly enough, the same color of\nmaterial as that lying around the edges of the crater. It has\nsome radial rings, which give an indication of a subsidence of\nsome kind, or of sliding downhill. That is really the f i s t\ncrater where I have been able to see any sort of layering in\nthe walls. Now the f i s t layer on the north side and also on\nthe south side, in the dark-brownish layer of the thing, you\ncan see parts that are jagged. In other words, there is a slight\nchange in slope. That looks like it is a very steep slope, which\nwould indicate that it is a fairly compacted type of material\nin the f i s t layer. And then the slope changes in the white\nlayer on down a little bit more. And the white layer seems to\nsort of maintain the same slope as the dark-gray layer. (CMP,\nrev 39)\n\nAt higher Sun angles and to another observer, the\nsequence of layers in the walls of Dawes Crater\nsuggested overturning of strata:\nIn Dawes, I think you can see the overturned [units]. The\nrim materials are made up of the brownish-gray material, and\nthe walls underneath these are the bluish gray, which is the\nage relationship suggested by topography; that would be the\nlower unit is forming the rim, with inverted stratigraphy.\n(LMP, rev 62)\n\nLayering was also noted in segments of the Rimae\nMenelaus that appear to have raised rims when\nobserved at low Sun elevation angles:\nThose rilles to the north of [Menelaus] , there is a bunch\nof them crisscrossing. One is right on the edge of the\nSerenitatis basin. But they have got slightly raised rims\naround the edges. You can see some layering down inside the\nrille itself, in the one that runs in the east-west direction.\n(CMP, rev 15)\n\nGEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS FROM LUNAR ORBIT\n\n28-2 1\n\nThe color boundaries in southern Mare Serenitatis,\nparticularly north of Menelaus Crater (fig. 28-18),\nreceived much discussion throughout the mission.\nThe following observations were made of this area:\nWhen I take a look at it from this angle, the ejecta from\nPlinius covers up the rilles and the annulus around Serenitatis. . . Now, we are getting into a relatively low Sun. And\nSerenitatis is a lot lighter colored than the light tan, to me.\nAt this low Sun, you look out into Tranquillitatis, across\nF\'linius, and that turns out to be the same kind of gray tan, it\nis darker.. . There is a definite color difference between\nthem [Tranquillitatis and Serenitatis]. And it almost looks as\nif the color from Tranquillitatis extends on over, or kind of\ndrapes over the edge, and covers up part of Serenitatis.\nWe are at the same Sun angle, and there is no doubt about\nit from Tacquet on up to Menelaus, there is a group of small\nrilles and those rilles have ejected material, around and over\nthe rilles; not impact-type ejecta. It has got to be a volcanic\nejecta of some kind. It is a darker brown than the tan of\nSerenitatis. (CMP, rev 28)\nGoing to come across the Tacquet area again, and there is\na bright crater, a recent crater, in that dark annulus in the\nsouthern part of Serenitatis. It shows up again as that kind of\na bluegray brightness, as opposed to the tannish brightness\nof the bright craters in Serenitatis. There is still no apparent\ncolor tone or differentiation in the wrinkle ridge in this part\nof it. The only differentiation is that it looks like south of\nTacquet you get the same color tone on over into Tranquillitatis as you get between Tacquet and Menelaus. (CMP, rev\n35)\nLooking at Menelaus, you can see where the dark edge of\nSerenitatis goes through the crater. And, the north wall is\nquite distinctly grayer, let us say bluish gray, than the south\nwall, which is very light gray in the talus. My guess is that it is\na very nearly vertical contact at that point. (LMP, rev 66)\n\nSulpicius Gallus Area\nThe dark mantling materials on the western rim of\nthe Serenitatis basin are more varied and perhaps\nmore complex than on the southeastern rim. Materials of the dark mare annulus in southern Serenitatis\nappear to be overlain by younger mare materials that\nalso postdate the dark mantling units of the.Sulpicius\nGallus area on the western rim of Serenitatis. These\nrough and textured materials are to be contrasted\nwith the patches of dark units between Montes\nHaemus and Montes Apenninus to the west (fig.\n28-19). The objective of this observation was to\ncompare these units to the Serenitatis mare materials,\nwith emphasis on the color tones. (This task was\nadded to planned observations in real time.)\nWhen we are coming around the dark annulus, follow it\naround, by Menelaus and Tacquet, it seems to change colors a\nlittle bit when we get up to the Sulpicius Gallus. I guess the\n\nFIGURE 28-18.-Contact between two mare units in southem Mare Serenitatis. The older and darker unit near the\nr m of Menelaus Crater (lower edge) displays rougher\ni\ntopography; the younger and lighter unit contains a broad\nwrinkle ridge (AS17-150-23069).\nonly thing you can say is that the southern part there, in the\nTacquet region, has a more of a bluish tint. And, then to me,\nthis has more of a brownish tint to it when you get to the\nSulpicius Gallus region.\nI am just passing Menelaus . . . and Sulpicius Gallus is just\nnow coming up. I think the Sun angle has a lot to do with\nthat, because this whole Sulpicius Gallus region looks kind of\nbrownish to me. I will have to check that when the Sun gets a\nlittle bit higher. (CMP, rev 24)\nI am just passing over Sulpicius Gallus, now. And just\nbeyond Sulpicius Gallus, you got a gentle slope of the massif\ncoming down and then it changes slope a little bit. And that\nmight be what we have at one time or another called the high\nwater mark, but I believe that is just a talus change in the\nslope. But as soon as you cross that area, we have a dark-tan\nmaterial that essentially covers the highland. It is a hummocky material. There are a few rilles just north of Sulpicius\nGallus; those rilles, again, have the dark-tan material on them.\n(CMP, rev 36)\n\n28-22\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nFIGURE 28-19.-0blique view looking westward from the dark mantling deposits on the western rim\nof Mare Serenitatis. Rimae Sulpicius Gallus are in the lower right corner; DCaldera (circled) is near\nthe upper left edge of the photograph (AS17-153-23572).\n\nAs will be discussed later, the CMP noted an\norange zone on the northeast rim of Shorty Crater.\nEjecta blankets of several craters of comparable size\nand larger also displayed an orange color. Referring to\nthese craters later in the mission, the LMP added:\nRon says that he already commented on those, and they\nlook very obvious to me . . . [The color] is a light orange, in\ncontrast to the brown gray of the dark mantle in the vicinity\nof Sulpicius Gallus. There is a good one right down there.\nNow, that one looks like a constructional cone that is\norangish. And that is right out on a raised projection of the\nbrown-gray dark mantle out onto the light-blue-gray annulus\nmaterial. (LMP, 62)\nrev\n\nIn addition to the constructional-appearing,\norange-tinted craters and the many orange-colored\nblankets around small impact craters in the Sulpicius\nGallus region, an elongate depression with orangerelated colors was also discovered (fig. 28-20).\n\nThere is a large gouge just south of the Sulpicius Gallus\nrille. The gouge is a rimless depression, and streaming down\nfrom the upper portion of that depression are not only our\nold friend the orange gray, but some would be a red brown\ngray, very clear coloration . . . There is another crater we will\nhave to look a t . . . There is a whole bunch of them down\nthere.. . Yes, we are seeing an orange Moon now. In this\nwhole dark mantle in here around Sulpicius Gallus there are\nscattered craters with a variety of orange to red-brown hues.\nAnd they all, except for that large rimless depression, which\nlooked as if it was exposing some layers which were\nstreaming those colors, all the other craters seem to be small\nimpacts that apparently are penetrating just far enough into\nthe dark mantle material to tap this zone of orange to\nred-brown material. (LMP,rev 64)\nThat rimless, V-shaped depression [fig. 28-2Ocb)l that had\nthe streaked talus on it has a mottled rim area that has the\norangish-tan or orangish-gray color as the spot. And it looked\nas if the more red-gray, red-brown-gray, if you will, material\nwas lower in the section within the walls of the depression.\nThis is a very steepwalled depression, by the way. It has talus\n\nGEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS FROM LUNAR ORBIT\n\n28-23\n\nwith a definite contact between it and the dark material\naround it, and it had that orange-brown hue to it, without\nany question a t al (CDR, rev 64)\nl.\n\nLANDING SITE AREA\nThe Taurus-Littrow landing site on the southeastern rim of Mare Serenitatis was studied from orbit\nfor (1) regional characteristics that may reflect on the\nsampling area and (2) details of local structures that\nmay help decipher the setting of explored sites.\n\nGeneral Setting\nObservations ftom orbit began very early during\nthe mission and continued throughout the orbital\nperiod. One of the more interesting problems was to\nsee whether or not it is possible to define a source\npoint for the landslide or white mantle on South\nMassif (figs. 28-21 and 28-22). The slide itself and the\nscarp that goes through it were obvious even at very\nlow Sun elevation angles:\n\nFIGURE 28-20.-Apollo 17 photographs of Sulpicius Callus\nformation where orange-tinted material was observed\nduring lunar orbit. (a) Two 0.5-km-diameter craters. The\nupper crater is an impact in the dark plain and exhibits\norange-tinted ejecta (AS17-148-22771).

For general setting, see figure\n28-19.\nstreaming down the sides of it, and the coloration streams in\nthis same direction. It looks as if there may be layers or\nroughly horizontal zones that have the coloration that we are\nseeing, which are forming the talus slopes down below them.\n(LMP, rev 6 5 )\n\nThese observations of the orange materials were\nalso confirmed by the third crewmember:\nJust so you are fully aware, we are not sort of just leaning\nand getting colorblind up here, I tell you, the last one Jack\nwas talking about [the small impact crater, fig. 28-20(a)] was\nnot even subtle. Its entire ray pattern was this color material,\n\nWith respect to the landing site, when I first had it in\nview, there was a clear lightening in the area of the light\nmantle. It was not sharply defined; but around the crater\nh a and Nansen and to the west of the scarp, there was very\nclearly, slightly brighter reflectivity. (LMP, rev 2)\nI can now see down in through the shadow. I can see Bear\nMountain. I cannot really make out the slide yet. Most of the\nNorth Massif is still in shadow due to the Sculptured\nHills.. . But, I did see some sort of albedo change that went\nacross the canyon about in the vicinity of the scarp. (CDR,\nrev 2)\nYou could really see a difference between South Massif\nand the mantle material through there. The mantle is not\nnearly as dark as it looks on the pictures, though. But South\nMassif, especially, looked whitish in color. I guess it is\nbecause the Sun was shining on i t . . . You can see the slide\nand definitely see the scarp going across through there. (CMP,\nrev 3)\nI got the landing site. We are right over the top of it, and\nthe scarp is fantastically detailed a t this [Sun angle] . . . The\nlight unit is very obviously mantling the area. The scarp is\nvery detailed, and, so far, [I] could not see any structure in\nthe massifs at all. . . From this altitude and with that low\nSun, there is no question of the sharpness of the topographic\nfeatures in the landing area. The scarp, and even some of the\napparent backflow features, that is, apparent flows to the\nwest in the light mantle area, were extremely sharp, even\nthose fronts going west were sharp. It looked even more like\na mare ridge than it ever did before. (LMP, rev 5 )\nThe scarp definitely cuts up through the North Massif. I\ncannot see a continuation into the South Massif at all. And it\nalmost looks like a flow coming from the direction of Family\nMountain, lapping up on the side of the North Massif. That is\n\n28-24\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nFIGURE 28-21.-0blique view looking westward from the Taurus-Littrow landing site. Arrow,\nshowing the direction of fight, indicates the landing point (AS17-148-22770).\nthe way it looks as you go on by it. I could not see anything\nthat would lead you to believe that the slide area, so to\nspeak, would come on across anything that would be the\nsource of that slide area. (CMP, rev 15)\n\nAs discussed in earlier sections of this report,\nblue-gray rocks were sampled at several localities in\nthe landing site. The same color tone was described\nfrom lunar orbit in the vicinity of larger craters in the\nsubfloor materials as well as on the slide.\nYou still get that same bluish tint from the area in the\nlanding site. At station number 2, on the landslide, it is going\nto be a pretty good little depression there. (CMP, rev 24)\nAreas in the landing site where we now know there are\nextensive blocks of the subfloor material, particularly in the\nwalls of the larger craters, I have the impression that those\nblock fields, from this altitude, give a light bluish-gray\nappearance. (LMP, rev 66)\nJust north of the bright-rayed craters in the Littrow area,\nthere are five craters, probably in the range of 500 to\n1000 m; and all five have the sequence of colors in the walls,\nfrom rim down, of a brown gray, blue gray, and then brown\ngray. They are all identical in that and quite clear. And that\nblue gray is comparable to the blue gray that is visible in the\ncraters such as Sherlock in the landing area. (LMP, rev 72)\n\nThe differences in albedo, color tone, and texture\nbetween the massif units and the Sculptured Hills\nwere obvious from orbital altitude both at low and\nhigh Sun elevation angles:\nI can see the landing site now quite well. The slide area\ndefinitely shows up. The South Massif seems to have the Sun\nshining right on the walls. I am looking for any type of\nlayering, or anything like that, and cannot see anything. The\nbig difference between the massif structures and the Sculp\ntured Hills is that the massifs look like they have a steeper\nslope. And they do not seem to have that type of covering\nover them, like the Sculptured Hills do. (CMP, rev 15)\nThe albedo differences are very definite: one is the dark\nmantle on the floor; one is the South and North Massifs; and\nthe other is the Sculptured Hills. And the Sculptured Hills\nhave a light-gray albedo between the Massifs and the dark\nmantle. This line is very evident and there is a definite break\nin slope that you can see between the South Massif and the\nwhite mantle out on the valley floor. (CDR, rev 62)\nTo me, the Sculptured Hills incorporate the albedo both\nof the North Massif, or South Massif, and the mantle area and\ncombine them to give you a generally in-between gray\nalbedo, but the sculpturing is produced by the darker albedo\nthat looks like the mantle, and the lighter albedo that looks\nlike the massifs. (CMP, rev 62)\n\nGEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS FROM L U N A R ORBIT\n\n28-25\n\nof the crater. It is tangent to the north edge or perpendicular\nto the scarp. (CMP, rev 41)\nOn Shorty, I still have that light-orangish-tan material. It\nis essentially perpendicular to the line of the slide area there\nin the northern semicircle of the rim. (CMP, rev 62)\nMy impression of Shorty from the other day, and also\nfrom seeing these craters that seem to have orange around\nthem, they look very much like impact craters from orbit. At\nany rate, if that is an alteration phenomenon, it is being\nlocalized around the structure created by the impact. But in\nthis latter case, it looks as if the impact itself penetrated into\na zone of that color. (LMP, rev 64)\nThe craters we are seeing around Sulpicius are very clearly\norange gray and the whole, or at least most of the crater, is\nthat way. We looked at Shorty today, and Ron said that even\nthe little bit of orange that he saw the other day is not\nvisible, and I agree with that. The amount of orange we saw\non the surface certainly would not be comparable to what we\nare seeing around Sulpicius Gallus. . . And on a couple of\nquick scans, on previous revs, of the area, the dark mantle,\nnear Littrow, I did not notice any obvious orange-gray\ncraters. (LMP, rev 65)\nI still get a feeling that there is just a tinge of the orange\nor tannish orange around Shorty, looking at it with the\nbinoculars. (CMP, rev 74)\n\nD-CALD E R A\nFIGURE 28-22.-Taurus-Littrow landing site. Note that the\nscarp displays mare ridge characteristics between the\nNorth Massif (top) and the South Massif (lower half); it\nalso appears as a flow that laps up against the North\nMassif (AS 17-150-23006).\n\nSHORTY CRATER\nMuch excitement was generated during the mission by the finding of orange soil on the rim of\nShorty Crater (fig. 28-22). The CMP was asked, after\nthe discovery, to determine whether the orange soil\ncould be observed from orbit. An orange-tinted zone\nwas described particularly on the north rim of\nShorty. This finding also led to further concentration\non craters of a similar size in western Mare Crisium, in\nthe Littrow B area, and in the Sulpicius Callus area.\nThe orange-tinted zone was obvious at intermediate Sun elevation angles (on rev 40) but harder\nto discern at high illumination (on rev 65):\nI have got Shorty in the picture. It is a sharper crater than\nany of them . . . Did they find that orange stuff on the north\nside of i t ? . . . I would say they just barely got into the\n[orange] stuff, then, because the north rim has more of a tint\nof a different color to i t . . . Would you believe an orangish\ntan through these binoculars? (CMP, rev 40)\nThrough these glasses, Shorty still looks light tannish\norange. And it does not come all the way down to the center\n\nThe low hills between the Montes Haemus to the\neast and Montes Apenninus to the west are interspersed with patches of superposed dark material (fig.\n28-19). In one of these patches is a D-shaped\ndepression (fig. 28-23) that was previously interpreted as a volcanic caldera (ref. 28-16). The structure is unique, with no equivalent formations on the\nMoon. It was studied from orbit to further characterize its nature:\n\nFIGURE 28-23.-The Dshaped depression in the dark\nmantling material west of the Montes Haemus exhibits a\nlight-blue-gray tint.

(LMP, rev 73)\n\nEULER AREA\nNear the end of the mission, very little time was\navailable for observing some of the interesting features in the Euler area. Many structures believed to be\nvolcanic occur to the south of Euler Crater (fig.\n28-25), including what seems to be a main source of\nsome of the Imbrium lava flows (ref. 28-17). There\nappears to be a color boundary within the walls of\nEuler itself as observed from orbit:\nThe lower part of Euler is blue gray, and the upper is a\n\nvery light gray, from the talus slope up to the rim.

(CMP, rev 14)\n\nLineaments\nMuch discussion about small-scale lineaments on\nlunar slopes followed the description and photographs of the ones observed on Mons Hadley during\nthe Apollo 15 mission. During Apollo 16, similar\nfeatures were described in many regions of the Moon,\non slopes as well as on flat surfaces (ref. 28-5). During\nApollo 17, lineaments were observed and photographed during the surface stay time; some were also\ndescribed from lunar orbit:\nIn a place where the Sun is just grazing the slope, it is a\nsteep slope on the north rim of Crisium, I can see the\nhorizontal lineaments that were such a controversy on\n[Apollo] I5 . . . There are some very steep slopes that just\nhave grazing Sun on them now, and with the binoculars, you\ncan see that horizontal lineation pattern.\nAlso, on that lineation question, not only where the Sun\ngrazes a slope do you see the horizontal lineations, but they\n\nGEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS FROM LUNAR ORBIT\nare at the southern end of the shadowed area on a slope. You\nget a couple other lineations showing up at least in a couple\nof places I saw. One would be parallel to the slope, that is\ncross-contour, and the other was at an angle to that direction,\nsay of about 30\xc2\xb0. (LMP, rev 3)\n\nCraters\nObservations were made of various types of lunar\ncraters. The first unplanned observation was that of\nKopff Crater at latitude 17\xe2\x80\x9d S and longitude 90\xe2\x80\x99 W in\nMare Orientale:\nDelta-rim crater-just as has been, I think, discussed in the\nliterature-has no obvious ejecta blanket around it, compared\nto other larger craters within the basin. We are directly over\nthat crater right now. It is fiied with mare, very smooth\nmare. Matter of fact, within that fii, I can see no craters.\nGetting very close to the Earth terminator, but you see good\ntexture in the ejecta blanket of the large crater in the north\npart of the inner basin of Orientale. The radial ridge and\nvalley patterns are very clear; the concentric coarse hummocks near the rim are apparent; and you can even see the\npatterns of secondaries. (LMP, rev 1)\n\nNumerous craters on the far side display flat,\nsomewhat dark floors; these floors are commonly\ndomed in smaller craters. In larger and fresher craters\n(e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bright One\xe2\x80\x9d in ref. 28-18), there are\nscarps and fronts indicative of fluid flow. During\nApollo 17, the first impression of these features from\norbit was that these floors were volcanic; however,\nthe original melts were later (and after repeated\nobservation) attributed to shock melting by impact.\nFresh, rayless craters on the far side, probably\nEratosthenian in age, all appear to have a mare-type\nor volcanic-type floor, suggesting the possibility that\na liquid mantle existed during the Eratosthenian era\nand was penetrated by these craters. (Paraphrased\nfrom CMP, rev 48)\nI guess the feeling I was getting is that most of the\n[Eratosthenian] age craters all have some sort of a mound, a\ndomical structure, down in the bottom of the crater. Even\nthe smaller ones, some of the 30- to 50-km-size class. And the\nflat floors look volcanic. Some of the bigger ones, of course,\nare volcanic, the lava flows on the floor of these big craters.\n(CMP, rev 48)\nWhile we are waiting for the site to come up again here,\nwhich seems to interest us every time we go over it, I think\nwe sort of came to a general consensus on the problem of the\nsmaller cone-shaped craters on the far side that have the little\npool-like concentrations of material in the bottom. If you\nlook at the freshest of those craters, there seems to be\ncontinuity between the streaks of very dark material that\ncover the walls and the rim of the fresh coneshaped craters.\nAs the crater gets older, that distinction becomes less\n\n28-3 1\n\nobvious; however, the pool remains, and all you lose is the\ndark streaks on the rim and on the walls of the crater. I think\nwe sort of suspect that the pool in the bottom of the fresh\ncraters is just the concentrated impact melt that some of\nwhich stayed there during the impact and others drained\nback after the impact from the walls. And then, with time,\nthat pool may be subdued some. The structures in it, the\nswirls and little domes in that pool, are subdued possibly not\nonly by the impact but by debris, slides, and avalanches off\nthe walls of the crater. (LMP, rev 64)\n\nFeatures of the large crater Archimedes (100-km\ndiameter) were described in the context of lunar\nstratigraphy as seen within the Imbrium basin:\nArchimedes is one of those craters that, in the early days\nof the lunar mapping program, helped establish some of the\nfundamental age relationships between the various units that\nwere visible in the Earth-based photographs. In this particular\ncase, it related to the sequence of events that created\nImbrium and then flooded it with mare. And Archimedes is\ncompletely circular and it is filled with mare. And it, in itself,\nis superimposed on one of the main benches of the Imbrium\nbasin. Now, to have mare f i i g of approximately the same\nlevel in the vicinity of a large mare region is one of the things\nthat has suggested to many people that rather than single\nsources for mare lavas, you have a multitude of sources in a\nvery fractured lunar crust. The ultimate source at depth,\nthough, is still certainly a subject of controversy. (LMP, rev\n62)\n\nUnique features of the elongate Messier Crater,\nwhich is believed to be the result of an oblique\nimpact (fig. 28-27), were described from orbit by the\nCDR:\nIt has got a very sharply raised lip, and it has got some\nvery dark and rough rim deposits. It has also a very obvious\n\nFIGURE 28-27.-Part of Apollo 15 panoramic camera frame\nAS15-127 showing the elongate Messier Crater in Mare\nFecunditatis.\n\n28-32\n\nAPOLLO PRELIMINARY\n17\n\nfurrow, looks like it is elongated, generally to the east and\nwest. I cannot tell, but because of the shape of it and because\nof those dark rim deposits, I am sure there must be a vent\nthere somewhere, but it is too dark down in there. I cannot\nreally see for sure whether there is one or not. But, if there is,\nI imagine it is pretty big. And I imagine the elongation was\nproduced\nduring the thrust of the initial dynamics,\nthe\nformation by the impact.

Map units are\ndefined in figure 29-2; heavy lines indicate grabens\n\nto Sinus Aestuum were interpreted as a dark facies of\nthe Imbrium ejecta by Shoemaker and Hackman (ref.\n29-16). This interpretation was later rejected (refs.\n29-1 and 29-15) because the dark material (1)\nappeared to subdue the underlying topography, (2)\nappeared partly to overlap the mare surface, and (3)\nappeared to be thin or absent locally on hills with\nbright summits. Furthermore, it was believed that the\ndark material was in some way related to the rilles\n(ref. 29-15), because its association with rilles is\ncommon (cf. Sulpicius Gallus, Littrow, Bode, Conon,\nSchroter, and Hadley rilles). Because the rilles clearly\n\npostdated the Imbrium ejecta, it appeared likely that\nthe dark material was also younger than the Imbrium\nbasin. The dark unit at the Sulpicius Callus rilles was\nnamed the Sulpicius Callus Formation and was\ninterpreted as a pyroclastic blanket (ref. 29-1). The\nupper age of the unit was uncertain because, although\nit appeared to overlap some mare, the unit appeared\nto be covered by other mare. The formation was\naccordingly given a broad age range (Imbrian to\nEratosthenian).\nLunar Orbiter photographs showed that another\ndark unit in the Littrow rilles region also covers the\n\nSTRATIGRAPHIC STUDIES\n\nuplands and has similarly ambiguous relations with\nthe adjacent mare (figs. 29-6 and 29-7). This unit is\nnow commonly termed dark mantle. Here, as at the\nSulpicius Gallus rilles, subjacent high-albedo material\nis exposed only on hilltops and steep slopes where\ncreep of the near-surface materials apparently has\nremoved the dark mantle. Around and to the north of\nLittrow B Crater is a plains unit that is more heavily\ncratered and presumably older than the mare; it also\nis covered with the dark mantle. The relations with\nthe main mare to the west, however, are unclear on\nthe Lunar Orbiter photographs. In a preliminary\nunpublished map of this area made using the Lunar\nOrbiter photographs, one of the authors (Carr) gave a\nvery broad age range for the dark mantle (Copernican\nto Imbrian) because in places it appeared to cover the\nmare and in other places, as at the mare embayment\nwest of Littrow BA Crater (fig. 294), it appeared to\nbe covered by the mare. In the premission map of the\nApollo 17 landing site (ref. 29-17), the unit was\nassigned a young age (Copernican), but the explanation on the map cautioned that the relations were\nambiguous and that the unit might be time transgressive.\n\n29-7\n\nBased on Apollo 17 photographs, the mare material of southern Mare Serenitatis has been divided into\nseveral units, and the relative ages shown by superposition have been reevaluated. A brief description of\nthe different unit follows, and the evidence on which\nages have been assigned is presented.\n\nSTRATlG RAPHY\nStratigraphic Framework\nIn our revised stra.tigraphy, basalts of Mare\nSerenitatis fall into three broad age groups (fig. 29-3).\nThe oldest group (A) includes three dark units that\npredate the inward tilting and graben faulting of the\nmargin of Mare Serenitatis. (See section entitled\n\xe2\x80\x9cStructure.\xe2\x80\x9d) These oldest units are the dark basalt of\nthe Piinius area along the southern margin of the\nmare, the dark material of the Littrow area to the\neast, and the Sulpicius Gallus Formation in the west\n(fig. 29-2). The next youngest group (B) is dark lavas\nthat embay the broad grabens but are somewhat\nfaulted and tilted inward. Included in group B are a\npatch of basalt near Dawes, the dark basalt that forms\nmost of the eastern sector of the dark ring, and the\nmediumdark basalt of southwestern Mare Serenitatis.\nThe youngest group (C) is the light basalt that forms\nthe central bulk of Mare Serenitatis. Albedo and color\ndata on the various units are summarized in table\n29-1. Other remote-sensing methods provide additional data on the units, as described by Thompson et\nal. (part A of sec. 33).\n\nBasalt of Plinius Area\n\nFIGURE 29-6.-High-Sun view of Littrow area taken on\nApollo 15. Localities are discussed in text (Apollo 15\nmetric camera frame AS15-1115).\n\nOld dark lava along the southern margin of Mare\nSerenitatis near F\xe2\x80\x99linius appears continuous with the\nlavas of Mare Tranquillitatis to the south. This unit is\ncut by numerous broad rilles (grabens) concentric to\nMare Serenitatis. Apollo 17 photographs (fig. 2 9 4 )\nshow that the unit forms a bench sloping inward\ntoward Mare Serenitatis and that younger light-toned,\nflat-lying lava to the north laps against this slope and\ntruncates the grabens. To the west, the old faulted\nlava can be traced along the Menelaus rilles (fig.\n294), where the unit was designated the dark\nmember of the Tacquet Formation (ref. 29-1). Here\nthe unit is in a west-trending anticline embayed on\nboth sides by the lighter less-faulted basalt of\nsouthwestern Mare Serenitatis (originally designated\n\n29-8\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n1 1 1\n1 1\n\n40\n\n0\nkm\n\nFIGURE 29-7.-Low-Sun stereoscopic view of same area shown in figure 29-6 (Apollo 17 metric\ncamera frames AS174447 and 0449).\n\nas the light member of the Tacquet Formation (ref.\n29-1)). Perhaps the clearest example of superposition\nby younger units is at Menelaus t, where younger lava\nsurrounds an inlier of the old faulted basalt and\ncovers a broad rille that bisects the inlier. Like most\nof Mare Tranquillitatis, including the Apollo 11\nlanding site, the Plinius basalt is relatively blue in\ncolor, indicative of high titanium and iron (refs. 29-5\nto 29-7 and part A of sec. 33). Its probable\ncontinuity with Apollo 11 basalt (ref. 29-18) suggests\nthe Plinius basalt is Imbrian in age.\n\nDark Material of Littrow Area\nDark material of the Littrow area, including the\nApollo 17 landing site, is here concluded to be old\nalso. This very dark material includes both mare flows\nand a dark mantle, possibly of ash or cinders, that\ncovers some adjacent hills. Most previous studies\ninterpreted the dark mantle as younger than Mare\nSerenitatis (refs. 29-17 and 29-19 to 29-22), so the\nevidence for an old age for the unit will be examined\nhere in some detail.\n\nThe premare age is based on physical superposition\nrelations of younger mare against an irregular topographic surface of this dark material at numerous\nplaces. The western boundary of the dark material as\nseen at a high Sun angle (fig. 29-6) can be compared\nwith topography viewed stereoscopically in figure\n29-7. From points A to C in these photographs, the\ndark material is on hills and is terminated abruptly at\nthe base of the hills by lighter mare rocks to the west\n(eastern ring basalt and basalt of Mare Serenitatis).\nFrom points C to D, stereoscopic viewing shows an\ninflection where light, relatively flat-lying mare material laps eastward against a gently west-sloping\nsurface of the dark material of Littrow rilles. At point\nD, a southwest-trending rille is terminated abruptly\nby lighter mare at the albedo contact, then emerges\nagain at point E. A short section of this rille exposed\nin the light mare between points D and E is subdued\nand may be slightly buried (ref. 29-17). At inflections\nat points G , H, and I, younger mare again laps\neastward against sloping dark material, and, at point\nI, the mare truncates another rille in the dark\nmaterial. Only at point F does the albedo boundary\n\nSTRATIGRAPHIC\nSTUDIES\n\n29-9\n\nof thedarkmaterial\nfailto coincide ithanobvious plains here are not covered by dark mantle.

This unit is referred to here as eastern ring\nbasalt because it forms much of the eastern part of\nthe dark ring of Mare Serenitatis.\nIt appears to be\nredder than the dark basalt near Dawes or the basalt\nof the Plinius area, according\nto Soderblom\'s\ndata\n(ref. 29-5), and includes at least three subunits as\nsuggested by albedo and color (table 29-1).

An age older than the basalt of central\nMare Serenitatis is suggested by (1) the presence of a\nfew grabens and cracks and (2) the annular arrangement that is analogous to that of tilted old basalts\nalong the southern border of Mare Serenitatis.\nSuperposition relations are not clear cut, however.

A smaller concentric anticline in old basalts\nalong the Menelaus rilles (fig. 294) has been mentioned previously.\nThe sagging was mostly, but not entirely, completed when the basalts of intermediate age were\nemplaced. Thus, the Dawes basalt appears to have run\ndown the inclined surface toward Mare Serenitatis\nbut was, in turn, faulted by continued extension.\nSome of the resulting new grabens northeast and\nnorth of Dawes (fig. 29-7) merge with chains of\ncircular and elongate craters. These craters may be\nvents or may have formed by collapse into deep\nnarrow fissures. The deep tongue-depressor trough\n(fig. 29-7) suggests lava withdrawal from beneath a\nsolidified lava crust but appears even deeper than the\nthickness of the Dawes basalt, which it cuts. The\nDawes basalt and adjacent older rocks are cut also by\nnarrow fissures radial to Mare Serenitatis. The radially\nfissured area is in a local saddle in the sagged rim of\nMare Serenitatis. Cone-shaped vents (fig. 29-7) suggest the Dawes basalt was erupted from these radial\nfissures.\nNarrow cracks and grabens concentric with Mare\nSerenitatis formed in the eastern ring basalt and\nperhaps the basalt of southwestern Mare Serenitatis.\nThese may also have been associated with the\ncontinued sagging of the mare.

However, small\ncracks and grabens apparently continued to form\nlocally in the basalts for a considerable time because\nthe cracks are very fresh and sharp (fig. 29-9) and\nprobably are younger than much of the regolith.\nSome tiny grabens cut the Apollo 17 bright mantle\nunit of upper Copernican age (sec. 6).\nMare ridges (or \xe2\x80\x9cwrinkle ridges\xe2\x80\x9d) in Mare Serenitatis postdate the mare flooding.

Other ridges may be squeeze-ups as\nsuggested by Hodges (part B of sec. 31).\nAn inner system of ridges forms a nearly complete\ncircle mainly within the basalt of Mare Serenitatis,\nand a few radial ridges extend outward into older\nbasalts like spokes from this circle (ref. 29-26). Where\nthese radial ridges cross into older.basalt in the Plinius\nrilles (fig. 294), they become more subdued.

Similar zones of extension faults\nrim natural and manmade sag structures on Earth and\nare accompanied by inward compression\nzones (refs.\n29-27 to 29-30). Before lunar spacecraft\nmissions,\nBaldwin (ref. 29-31) suggested that the mare ridges of\nMare Serenitatis\nrepresent\nthe corresponding\ncompressional structures.\nAdding to the appeal of this\npossibility is a striking similarity of the mare ridges to\nsinuous thrusts in the compressional zone of a sagged\nHawaiian lava lake that was described by Swanson\nand Peterson\n(ref. 29-30). The stratigraphic\nand\nstructural\nsequence described in the present report,\nhowever,\nargues that the mare ridges are much\nyounger than the graben rilles. Most ridges postdate\nsolidification\nof the youngest basalt, which appears\nnot to be appreciably sagged.\nIn its early history, Mare Serenitatis subsided as it\nfilled with lava. This may have been the result of\npartial isostatic compensation\ndue to the weight of\nthe lava (ref. 29-31). Compensation\nwas not complete, for Mare Serenitatis\nhas a marked\npositive\nfree-air gravity anomaly\n(ref. 29-32). Possibly the\nconcentric\nrim anticlines\nreflect material that was\n\ndisplaced\noutward isostatically.\nThe Hawaiian\nvolcanoes, which similarly are not completely\ncompensated (e.g., ref. 29-33), cause a crustal sag by their\nweight\nthat is also surrounded\nby an anticline\nresulting from subsurface outward displacement\n(ref.\n29-34).\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAND\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe major features of the stratigraphic\nand structural sequence\ncan be summarized\nin a schematic\ncross section across Mare Serenitatis (fig. 29-10). The\ndark oldest basalts include flows coextensive\nwith\nMare Tranquillitatis\nand also flows and pyroclastic\ndeposits (dark mantles) that erupted from the edge of\nthe Serenitatis\nbasin. The basin sagged, possibly\nisostatically,\nas basalts\nof intermediate\nage were\nemplaced. Sagging had nearly ceased by the time the\nyoungest\nflows were deposited.\nCompressive\nmovements including thrusting followed, and small extensional fissures formed in late Copernican\ntime.\nThe revised stratigraphic\nsequence that we have\nelaborated has implications\nfor lunar stratigraphy\nthat\ntranscend\nthe boundaries\nof Mare Serenitatis.\nDark\nmantle deposits\nand the darkest maria have commonly been assumed\nin geologic mapping\nto be\nrelatively youthful\n(e.g., ref. 29-35).

In places, the material\noverlies pre-Imbrian massifs; Imbrian mare; Imbrian\ngrabens; Imbrian, Eratosthenian, and early- and\nmiddle-Copernican craters; and fresh-looking scarps\n\n1\n\nI\n\n0\n\n30\n\nkm\n\nFIGURE 29-12.-Dark material mantles plains, mare, and highland material.

In\nthe lowlands, darker areas seem to be associated with\na higher degree of smoothing of buried craters,\nsuggesting that the mantle darkens with increasing\nthickness. Thickness probably varies from less than a\nmeter to no more than a few tens of meters, as\ninferred from the size of craters covered but not\n\n29-17\n\ntotally obscured by the dark mantle and from the size\nand color of ejecta of superposed craters; craters\npenetrating the mantle have bright or light-colored\nejecta aprons. Observations of the Apollo 17 crew\nindicate that in the landing area the dark mantle may\nmeasure only a few centimeters, but returned regolith\nsamples so far have not substantiated a distinct dark\nsurface layer. The presence of abundant dark glass\nspheres (sec. 7) is the only evidence so far that is\npossibly indicative of an unusual deposit in the\ntraverse region.\n\n29-18\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nSPECIAL R E LATIONSH IPS\nThe dark mantle seems especially thick and dark at\nthe rim of the Serenitatis basin, where it covers old\ngrabens and fresh-looking scarps and extends continuously from mare onto highlands material (fig.\n29-14). The western contact between dark mantle\nand mare material in one place (fig. 29-15) coincides\nwith the contact between mare and an old crater that\nhas the appearance of being excavated from plains\nmaterial, covered by dark mantling material, and\nflooded by mare. This sequence would suggest that\nthe dark mantle is older than mare material in this\narea. However, careful inspection of the contact\nshows that several small patches of dark material\nextend out over the mare material, suggesting that the\ndark mantle may be younger than the mare. This age\nrelationship, however, is not demonstrated conclusively because the dark patches could be reworked\nmaterial that has been mass wasted from adjacent\nslopes.\n\nFIGURE 29-1L-Contact between old crater rim and mare;\nr m apparently w a s covered by dark mantling material and\ni\nlater flooded by mare. Note possible mantling on mare\nmaterial below old crater rim in area A and lobate scarps\nthat could be flow lobes i area B (Apollo 1 7 panoramic\nn\ncamera frame AS17-2313).\n\nFarther south, the dark mantle extends out over\nmare terrain. The dark mantle is here underlain by\nolder dark mare, and the boundary of the mantle\nseems to coincide with the boundary between older\nand younger mare (fig. 29-16). This relationship\nsuggests that the dark mantle in this area is intermediate in age between the two mare materials.\nHowever, farther southwest, it seems to extend out\nover the young mare (figs. 29-12 and 29-17).\nOn the floor of the graben-like valley of the\nlanding area, the dark mantle is lighter in color than\nat the margin of the Serenitatis basin. The lighter\ncolor indicates either that the mantle may be older\nand lightened by mixing with highland material or\nthat the mantle is thinner (fig. 29-18). In turn, the\ndark mantle is partially overlain by a bright mantle\nextending northward across the floor of the landing\nsite valley.\nSoutheast of the landing site, a crater cluster of\nprobably middle-Copernican age is covered by dark\nmantle, the thinness of which is indicated by protruding blocks, exposures of valley subfloor material in\ncrater walls, and bright ejecta of very small craters\n(fig. 29-13). The thinning may have been caused by\nmass wasting of the elevated crater rims or may\nindicate an originally thinner cover in this area.\nFarther east, toward the center of the valley, a darker\ntone and smoother topography suggest blanketing by\nthicker deposits (fig. 29-12).\nIn the highlands, there are two distinct types of\ndark mantling material:\n1. Moderately dark material that has diffuse margins and generally is concentrated in depressions, in\nvalleys, and locally at the base of massifs (fig. 29-18).\nThis moderately dark material also occurs in gullies\ntrending directly downhill and on subhorizontal\nbenches and ledges that interrupt slopes (fig. 29-19).\n2. Very darkcolored patches, lobes, and streaks\non steep slopes, in places associated with craters;\nthese are conspicuous on top of the North Massif\nnorthwest of the landing site (fig. 29-20). This\nmaterial generally has a velvety surface appearance;\nhowever, in places it shows very sharp small pits,\ncraters, and scarplets. Its fresh appearance and its\nposition on steep slopes suggest that it is young\nmaterial.\nTwo exposures in the highlands north of the\nLittrow valley show that locally the moderately dark\nmantle is underlain by very dark mantle. One\nexposure is in the walls of a young crater that\n\nSTRATIGRAPHIC STUDIES\n\nFIGURE 29-16.-Dashed line shows contact between young mare devoid of dark mantle and old mare\ncovered by dark mantle.

A\nthin, very dark bed crops out in the upper wall of this\ncrater and sheds lobes of debris into the crater.\nHigher up in the wall, a thin but distinct bed of\nsimilar appearance is present in what probably is the\noverturned flap of crater ejecta. The other exposure is\non the precipitous slopes of the highland margin\nfacing the Serenitatis basin (fig. 29-14). Here, the\nmoderately dark mantle is underlain by a thin and\nvery dark bed that produces several dark lobes on the\nslope. These relationships suggest that the moderately\ndark mantle in the highlands locally is a mixture of\nmass-wasted, bright highland material and older\nunderlying dark mantling material.\nThe absence of thick dark mantling material on\nmost of the highland slopes can be explained by\nactive mass-wasting processes, which would remove\nunconsolidated material rapidly from steep slopes.\nHowever, a very thin dark layer may remain on steep\nslopes but be difficult to recognize. Alternatively, if\nthe dark mantle was emplaced by flow (as opposed to\nsome process of fallout), it may never have covered\nall the highlands.\n\nCRATERS\nkm\n\nu\n2\n\n0\nkm\n\nFIGURE 29-17.-Dark mantling produces varying effects on\nthree types of terrain (ApoUo 17 panoramic camera frame\nAS17-2320).

Most of these small\ndark-halo craters have shapes typical of impact craters\nof similar size (fig. 29-22(a)), and many are located\nwhere dark mantling material may have been excavated and ejected from beneath the surface. Therefore, many of these small dark-halo craters may be of\nimpact origin. However, some small dark-halo craters\nin the Taurus-Littrow area have characteristics unlike\nsmall bright-halo impact craters elsewhere. Some, for\nexample, are located on bright, steep slopes (fig.\n29-22(b)) apparently without dark material in the\nsubsurface. Yet dark material seems to have emanated\nfrom the craters and t o have slumped back into them.\nThere are also maar-like craters with dark halos, low\ndegraded rims, steep walls, and flat or rocky floors\n(fig. 29-22(c)), and very subdued craters with dark\nrays (fig. 29-22(d)). Other craters with bright floors\nand broad very dark rims (fig. 29-22(e)) are also unlike impact craters elsewhere. Many dark patches and\nsome dark streaks on crater rims (figs. 29-22(f) and\n(g)) have no obvious source but typically are associated with very small (< 10 m diameter) sharp pits.\n\nSTRATIGRAPHIC STUDIES\n\nFIGURE 29-18.-Apollo 17 landing site area.

Further\nstudy of orbital photographs and surface investigations of the Apollo 17 mission suggest the following\npossibilities.\n1. The dark mantle is a thick, very dark regolith\non old mare material. From this hypothesis, it follows\nthat the dark mantle in the highlands is a regolith\ndeveloped on lavas extruded in the highlands. The\ndark mantle burying low hills is a regolith on lavas\nthat flooded these hills. Very dark patches on steep\nslopes are either from fresh outcrops or from patches\nof lava that developed regolith. Dark halos around\ncraters would be composed of reworked regolith, and\ndark cover on young craters would be fallback\nregolith ejecta or deposits from adjacent young\nimpact craters. Dark, streaked, young craters in the\nhighlands would have penetrated into buried flows,\nsills, or dikes, and dark regolith would have developed\non the ejecta. Multiple thin sheets of lava with\nwell-developed regolith in the highlands may create\nthe impression of \xe2\x80\x9cdraping\xe2\x80\x9d over the topography.\nThe hypothesis does not explain why thick dark\nmantle deposits are maintained on steep slopes that\nare known t o mass waste rapidly. Neither does it\nexplain why the dark mantle is present on young\n\nFIGURE 29-20.-Area on top of North Massif northwest of\nApollo 17 landing site.

The tentative evidence that the dark\nmantle locally extends out over the young mare\nfurther weakens the argument. If the dark mantle is a\nregolith on young lavas, its substantial thickness in\nplaces defies easy explanation. Furthermore, to account for the unusually dark color of the mantle, the\nregolith must have developed under distinctly different conditions than elsewhere on the Moon, or else\nthe composition of the original lava was unique to\nthis region.\n2 . The mantle is composed of dark ejecta material. Objections to this hypothesis are that no crater\nof suitable age is present within a reasonable distance,\n\nand the patches of dark mantling material do not\nhave the configuration of typical rays. Impact into a\nlava lake is an alternative hypothesis that accounts for\nthe lack of a visible source crater. The apparent\nyoung age of the dark material in places, however,\nweakens this interpretation.\n3. The dark mantle is a pyroclastic deposit or\nash-flow tuff. It may be very thin and locally may be\nmixed into thick regolith developed on old mare.\nDark-halo craters could be vents or impact craters\nthat have reworked pyroclastic deposits. The patchy\nnature of the dark mantle suggests multiple sources.\nThis hypothesis fits most observations. A preSerenitatis mare age is suggested in some places, but\nevidence elsewhere suggests a locally younger age.\n\n29-24\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n4. The dark mantle has a different origin in\n\ndifferent places: a regolith with or without a pyroclastic component; a pyroclastic deposit or ash-flow\ntuff; or reworked material from dikes or sills. The\nargument that the dark mantle may have different\norigins is strengthened by its apparently different ages\nbut weakened by its uniform color and surface\ntexture as viewed on orbital photographs.\nNeither the origin nor the age of the dark mantling\nmaterial in the Taurus-Littrow region is yet established, and no firm hypothesis can be advanced until\nthorough studies are made of the new evidence from\ncrew observations, orbital photographs, and returned\nsamples.\n\nFIGURE 29-22.-Dark-halo craters in Taurus-Littrow region.

The Apollo 17 photographs\nprovide excellent\nmonoscopic\n(fig. 29-26)\nas well as stereoscopic\nviewing because of the favorably low Sun illuminations (15 \xc2\xb0 to 49\xc2\xb0). These new photographic\ndata\nallow the geology of the basin, the mare, and other\nnearby terrains to be reevaluated.\nThis reexamination,\ntogether\nwith data from\ncontinuing\nMoon-wide\nphotogeologic\nstudies and analyses of returned rocks\nfrom Apollo landing sites, has produced\na simple\nevolutionary\npicture\nof the region, expressed\nby\nfewer map\nunits and explained\nby fewer basic\nprocesses\nthan previously\nthought\nnecessary\n(refs.\n29-35 and 29-45 to 29-48).\n\nCRISIUM\n\nBASIN\n\nThe earliest discernible event was the large impact\nthat created the Crisium basin and its concentric\n\nmorphology\nor\nelongation of the\nTo determine\nbasins, the tings\n\nspacing and an apparent\neast-west\nbasin.\nthe degree of similarity with other\nwere reexamined and the generalized\n\npositions of their crests plotted on the stereoscopic\nApollo\n17 photographs.\nThree\nrugged\ntings are\ndelineated in the circummare\nterra (fig. 29-27), and\nanother ring is believed to lie within the mare. The\noutermost\nring, 970 km in diameter,\nis incomplete\nand topographically\nlow.\nIt bounds\nthe basinconcentric\nmare northwest\nof the crater Macrobius\nand is expressed as a raised arc near the eastern map\nboundary. The next ring inside is 680 km in diameter\nand consists of medium-sized\npeaks. Northwest\nof\nMare Crisium, in and near a depressed\narea partly\nflooded\nby mare, this ring is divided into several\nblocks and fractured\nalong a northwest\ntrend. The\nmost conspicuous\nring, 500 km in diameter, bounds\nMare Crisium proper\nand consists mainly of high\nbroad massifs. The innermost\nring (not delineated\nin\nfig. 29-27) consists of a few small but steep terra\npeaks in the mare north of Yerkes Crater and in the\ninner part of the eastern embayment.\nThe mare in\nwhich these peaks occur forms a shelf around the\ntopographically\nlower,\nisland-free\ncentral\nMare\nCrisium. The boundary\nbetween\nshelf and central\nmare, particularly\nabrupt in the northwest,\ncoincides\n\nraised rings and intervening\ntroughs.

In the less deeply flooded Orientale basin,\nthe relatively small peaks of the inner Rook ring rise\nabove a scarp-bounded\nshelf, which, if flooded, would\nresemble the shelf in Crisium. This inner Crisium ring\nand the 500-km Crisium ring apparently\nare closer\ntogether,\nhowever, than are the two Rook rings and\ndo not obey the 1.4 spacing ratio. The exact value of\nthis anomalous\nCrisium spacing is uncertain because\nof burial of the inner ring by mare.\nThe appearance\nof asymmetry\nof the basin is due\nmainly to an east-west elongation\nof the mare and\nonly partly to a minor ellipticity of the basin rings.\nThe presence of numerous\nsmall but steep peaks in\nthe large eastern embayment\nsuggests that most of\nthe asymmetry\nis due to foundering\nof the 500-km\nring. The margins of the embayment\ntrend northwest,\neast-west,\nand concentrically\nwith the basin. The\nnorthwest\ntrend is probably of internal origin and not\nrelated to the basin because it pervades much of the\nregion, notably in the rounded terra hills. It coincides\nwith a Crisium radial direction only in the depressed\narea northwest\nof the basin (ref. 29-54, pp. 180-181)\nand with the Crisium concentric directions only along\nthe eastern\nembayment.\nThe northwest\nand east\nsubsidences\ntherefore\noccurred\nwhere endogenous\nand basin structures coincided.\n\nPOSTBASIN\n\nMATER\n\nIALS\n\nAfter the subsidence\nand before mare flooding,\nduring a continued\nintense period of impact cratering\n\nSTUDIES\n\n29-33\n\non the entire Moon, light-colored\nplains materials\nwere deposited in depressions in the basin structure.\nEarlier systematic mappers in the region (refs. 29-35,\n29-45, 29-47, and 29-48) called on volcanism,\nto\nvarying degrees, to explain the plains, rounded terra\nhills, and certain\ncraters. Impact\nejecta or masswasted debris (or both) now seem more probable\ncomponents\nof the plains, in light of petrologic data\nfrom the Apollo landing sites and contact relations\napparent\non stereoscopic\nphotographs\n(refs. 29-49,\n29-50, and 29-55). The origin of some craters (Ici and\nIc, fig. 29-27) is still in doubt, but the origin of\ndark-halo\ncraters (unmapped,\nref. 29-56) and the\nrounded hills seems to be adequately\naccounted\nfor\nby nonvolcanic means (refs. 29-17, 29-21,29-46,\nand\n29-49).\nAfter formation of the plains and most of the large\ncraters in the region, the presumably\nbasaltic mare\nmaterials were emplaced in the central Crisium basin\nand in numerous\nperipheral depressions bounded by\nstructures approximately\nradial and concentric to the\nbasin. Mare Crisium consists mainly of planar flows\nand partly of forms with positive relief. The innermost of the peripheral\nmare patches is at a higher\nlevel than Mare Crisium, and each of the succeeding\npatches is slightly higher than its inner neighbor. An\nexception is the mare patch at the eastern boundary\nof the mapped area, which is on the outer flanks of\nthe Crisium basin. A single mapped patch may have\ntwo or three levels, the highest level outward. The\nlevels of the circumferential\nmare patches thus imply\na stepped basin structure.\nIn places between\ntwo\nlevels, the lava seems to have flowed over a buried\nterra scarp\nlines).\n\n(shown\n\nby arrows\n\nsuperposed\n\non dotted\n\nIn the long postmare\nhistory of the region, the\nonly deposits that seem to have formed are sheets of\ni\'me-textured\nimpact ejecta and fields of secondary\nimpact craters. These deposits appear to be extensive\non high-resolution\nphotographs\ntaken at low Sun\nangle but are minor volumetrically.\nTheir preservation\nattests to a sluggishness of the later degradational\nprocesses that contrasts\nwith the intense activity in\nthe much shorter period between formation\nof the\nCrisium basin\nand its filling by mare material.\nMaterials of the Crisium basin and of the craters\nformed before mare flooding 0ater pre-Imbrian time\nand Imbrian\nperiod)\nare texturally\ndistinguishable\nonly on low slopes around the largest craters and are\ndoubtless mixed chaotically\nin a surflcial fragmental\nlayer.\n\n29-34\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nSUMMARY\nThe\n\nCrisium\n\nbasin,\ning\n\nby\n\nplains\n\nand\n\nand\n\nis a typical,\n\nbasaltic\n\nby\n\nwasting,\ncesses\n\nbasin\n\nmodified\n\nwere\n\nof lunar\n\nmuch\n\nhistory\n\nmare\n\nin the\n\nof\n\nintensive\nduring\n\nNo\n\nimpact\n\nbasin\n\nimpact\ninfill-\n\norigin,\n\nmass\n\nModification\nduring\n\nthe\n\nevidence\n\nlunar\n\nsubsidence,\n\nvolcanism.\n\nthan\n\nCrisium\n\nlarge\n\nimpacts,\n\nmantles\n\nmore\n\nformation.\n\nexists\n\nsmaller\n\nthe\n\npro-\n\nfirst\n\nthird\n\ntwo-thirds\n\nfollowing\n\nfor\n\nvolcanism\n\nterra\n\nregion.\n\nREFERENCES\n2%1.

It is similar in\nform to Bear Crater (fig. 30-2), a small volcanic vent\nformed in Holocene basalt flows of the Snake River\n\nprimary surface features (channels,\ncollapse depressions) are well preserved. The general structure\nand\neruptive history for Bear Crater have been deduced\n\nPlains, Idaho. In this report, the two features are\ncompared\nand it is concluded\nthat Aratus CA may\nhave a geologic structure\nand history similar to that\nof Bear Crater.\n\nBear Crater is approximately\n780 m long, 254 m\nwide, and 80 m deep and appears to have formed\nthree merged eruptive centers. Spatter\nramparts of\nagglutinate occur as knobs at the southern end of the\ncrater, and to a less pronounced\ndegree at the\nnorthern end. The floor of Bear Crater is covered\n\nBEAR\n\nfrom photogeology\nand ground reconnaissance\nfor\ncomparisons with Aratus CA and similar lunar surface\nfeatures.\n\nCRATER\n\nwith talus, alluvium, and eolian deposits of unknown\nthickness.

Composite\nmeasured\nsections\nindicate that the shield was built of layers of basalt\nfrom multiple eruptions.\nThe dip of the layers near\nthe vent (fig. 30-4) averages\napproximately\n15 \xc2\xb0 ,\nsomewhat greater than the present slope on the flank\nof the shield.

Small (1- to 2-m wide) tubes\nexist in the pahoehoe basalt of the upper rim at the\nnorthern end of Bear Crater but were not found\nelsewhere. The tubes trend generally downdip; some\napparently connect with \xe2\x80\x9cNorth Hole,\xe2\x80\x9d a 66-mdiameter, flat-floored collapse depression (fig. 304).\nSurface features on the shield (figs. 30-3 and 304)\ninclude lava channels, collapsed lava tubes, collapse\ndepressions, and primary flow structures (e.g., pahoehoe ropes). Bear Channel I (fig. 304) is a prominent\nstructure originating on the eastern side of the crater.\nAlthough it is initially rather wide (222 m) and deep\n(49 m), it tapers to a narrow (approximately 21 m),\nshallow (approximately 2.5 m) structure. The channel\nmeanders 2.8 km to the south, where it is buried by\nyounger pahoehoe flows erupted from rifts of Craters\nof the Moon. The degree of channel meandering\nincreases in its lower portion, where the general\ngradient is less (fig. 30-5(a)). It is unlikely that most\nof the channel was a lava tube with a freestanding\n\nroof. Overflow from the channel has created broad,\nslightly raised levees along some parts of the channel,\nas indicated in the topographic profiles (figs. 30-5(d)\nand 30-5(e)). Flow directions obtained from pahoehoe festoons along the channel rim show that surface\ndrainage back into the open channel occurred during\nthe final stages of flow.\nBear Channels I1 and I11 may represent a single\nflow structure originating at the northern part of the\nvent. The structure apparently was intersected and\npartly eroded by the younger Bear Channel I. Bear\nChannels I1 and 111, unlike Channel I, are collapsed\nlava tubesnava channels. (In active flows, parts of a\nlava river may remain open as a channel, whereas\nother parts of the river may become roofed to form\ntubes (refs. 30-1 and 30-2).)\nThe northern end of the Bear Crater complex\ndeveloped during initial eruptions. Lavas were fluid\nenough to permit the formation of lava tubes, which\ncarried lava away from the vent to build the early\nshield structure. Bear Channels I and I1 were the\ndominant conduits carrying lava to the southeastern\n\nVOLCANIC STUDIES\n\n30-3\n\nof the crater rim. Withdrawal of lava down the vent\nproduced a crater floor lower than the level of the\nlast formed channel. Gradation subsequently has\nsmoothed and rounded parts of the shield, the crater,\nand the channels.\n\nARATUS CA CRATER\n\nRecent\nh\n\nL\n\nE\n\nE lQpbll\n\nz\n\nr\n\nw \'\n3\n\n0\n\nw\n\nBasalt, mostly pahoehoe; from Craters of the\nMoon\nBasalt, pahoehoe; possibly from flows associated\nwith the Idaho riff\n\n2 IQpb,l \'Basalt,\n.-\n\npahoehoe, erupted from unnamed vent\n\nFIGURE 3@3.-Photogeologic sketch map of Bear Butte\nShield volcano, showing the relationship of Bear Crater to\nthe shield and the surrounding lava flows.\n\npart of the shield. The eruptive center shifted south\nand eventually formed the main part of Bear Crater.\nLack of lava tubes associated with this phase indicates\nthat viscosities of the lava increased slightly, although\nnot to such a degree that aa lavas were erupted. The\nsouthern end of the shield continued to build by\naccretion of lavas carried through Bear Channel I and\nas sheet flows that spilled over the rims of the crater\nand channel. Crustal foundering of these sheet flows\nresulted in the formation of at least one collapse\ndepression. Bear Channel I widened during and after\nactive lava flow through slumping and subsidence of\nits rims. In the final eruptive stage, fountaining\nproduced spatter ramparts of agglutinate along parts\n\nAratus CA is associated with a set of mare ridges\napproximately 90 km east of the contact between\nMare Serenitatis and the highlands. Some mare ridges\nare interpreted as extrusive, intrusive, or combination\nextrusive-intrusive features (ref. 30-3). Parts of the\ncrater show different stages of degradation, and,\nalthough all of the floor and most of the crater walls\nare covered with talus, outcrops are exposed discontinuously in at least three horizons in the southern\ncrater rim, indicating that Aratus CA was the site of\nmultiple eruptions. Initial eruptions are interpreted as\nhaving formed the older, fusiform part of the crater,\nat which time the northeast-trending trench was\nformed. The trench is 3.9 km long and averages 640\nm in width. The trench may be interpreted as a flow\nchannel, in which the northern end is roofed as a lava\ntube (as yet uncollapsed), or the trench may be a\nstructurally controlled collapse depression. The latter\ninterpretation tentatively is favored in this report. In\neither case, the trench has widened as a result of\nsubsidence along its rims, especially near the juncture\nwith the main crater. Other parts of Aratus CA\ndisplay fractures that are subparallel to the crater\nrims, and the fractures probably represent incipient\nsubsidence.\nSpillover of lava from the crater rims during an\nearly or intermediate eruptive phase resulted in a lava\nflow channel (or lava tube, now collapsed) on the\nsouthern rim of the crater. The channel is small,\naveraging approxin~ately\n240 m in width, and trends\nalmost due south for a distance of approximately 11\nkm from the main crater. By comparison, a length of\n11 km is common in terrestrial lava flow channels and\nlava tube systems.\nThe subcircular crater in the west-central part of\nAratus CA is superimposed on other parts of the\nstructure and apparently was formed during the last\neruptive stages. The rims and slopes of the feature are\nsoftened, and there are fewer large talus blocks than\nin the other parts of Aratus CA. This crater may\nrepresent a pyroclastic eruptive phase, but evidence\nto support this hypothesis is tenuous.

Scotp\n\nSmall volcanic cones with summit craters or\nbreached walls occur in several areas on the Moon.\nMost of these features have basal diameters of\napproximately 1 to 2 km and probably are not more\nthan a few hundred meters in height. None have been\nso clearly photographed, however, as those shown in\nApollo 17 metric and panoramic camera coverage of\nthe southeastern margin of the Serenitatis basin. Two\ncones (A and B in fig. 30-6) approximately 10 km\napart project above mare material of Eratosthenian to\nImbrian age (sec. 29, part A). Between the cones,\nsmall mounds (Cy D, and E in fig. 30-6) appear to be\nalined along the buried extension of a rille (F in fig.\n30-6, mostly outside photograph) and are probably\nvolcanic extrusions or domes. In both scale and\nmorphology, these and other lunar cones are remarkably similar to terrestrial cinder cones (figs. 30-7 and\n30-8), and their interpreted volcanic origin is not\ndependent on controversial criteria such as dark\nhalos, smooth rims, or their association with materials\nassumed to be volcanically derived. Summit craters\nmay be coincidental and the result of impacts on the\ncrests of hills, but their occurrence with cones having\nbreached surfaces or along structural lineaments (or\nboth) strongly favors a volcanic or volcano-tectonic\norigin. Like their terrestrial counterparts, these cones\nprobably are composite structures made up of interlayered pyroclastic material and lava flows.\nFigure 30-7 is a radar image of a part of the San\nFrancisco volcanic field in northern Arizona. Fine\ndetails in topography are enhanced by this imagery,\nwhich shows the partial burial of a lunar-like rille by a\nlava flow (A in fig. 30-7), an association more\ncommon on the Moon than on Earth. This basalt flow\nand rille should be compared with those in part D of\nsection 31, figures 3 1 4 3 and 3144. The flow was\nextruded from the base of a young cinder cone (B in\nfig. 30-7), and several older flows are faintly visible in\n\naU.S. Geological Survey.\n\nthe area, one from a breached crater (C in fig. 30-7)\nin the eastern part of the photograph.\nFigure 30-8 shows cinder cones and basalt flows in\nthe Lunar Crater volcanic field, Nevada. These cones\nalso are alined along structural breaks (A, B, and C in\nfig. 30-8) and are associated with small, scattered\nmounds (D and E in fig. 30-8) similar to those of\nfigure 30-6; there are some slight differences, however. No obvious flows issue from the lunar cones,\nand they appear to be more subdued than some of the\nterrestrial forms and have no sharp breaks between\n\nu\n2\n\n0\n\nkm\nFIGURE 3@6.-Lunar volcanic features i Mare Serenitan\ntis.

It is possible\nthat the Serenitatis lavas were more fluid and that\nflow-front scarps did not form. The cinder cones of\nfigure 30-8 are approximately 10 000 yr old or less,\nwhereas the ages of those in figure 30-6 are probably\non the order of several billion years. That they are\nsomewhat more degraded is understandable even\nthough the erosion of these particular lunar features\nmay be mainly attributable to the relatively slow\nprocess of mass wasting and meteoroid bombardment.\nMany analogs exist between lunar and terrestrial\nfeatures but generally at grossly different scales. The\ncinder cones and associated features illustrated in this\npaper are similar in size; thus, morphologic comparisons are more readily made. Such factors as the lunar\ngravity, probably lower volatile content of the\nmagma, and lack of an atmosphere on the Moon must\n\n0\n\n1\n\nkm\n\nFIGURE 3@8.-Terrestrial cinder cones in Nevada.

McGetchin and Head (ref. 30-5) concluded that the net effect of these variations is a\nmuch wider distribution of ejecta around a volcanic\nsource on the Moon than on Earth. The terrestriallike cinder cones in southeastern Mare Serenitatis\nthus show that for the formation of the cones and\nmounds, the dynamic pressure or volatility (or both)\nof these eruptions must have been lower than for\ncomparable terrestrial features.\n\nVOLCANIC STUDIES\n\n30-9\n\nPART C\nSOME VOLCANIC AND STRUCTURAL FEATURES\nOF MARE SERENITATIS\n\nW.B. Bryana and Mary-Linda A d a m 8\n\nRelationships between volcanic and structural features along the southern edge of Mare Serenitatis can\nbe examined in detail because of the favorable\nlow-angle lighting in the Apollo 17 photography.\nMetric camera photographs enlarged 2X were observed at 1X or 6X magnification. Relief was estimated from parallax differences, assuming a nominal\nspacecraft elevation of 110 km and a mean photographic scale of 0.7 km/mm.\nThis section includes a summary of observations of\n(1) contact relations between the dark border material and the central mare fill, (2) a late-stage lava flow\nwith associated cinder cones, and (3) certain structural features related to the development of the mare\nbasin and its associated volcanic landforms. The\nsection is concluded with a chronologic summary of\nvolcanic and structural events that we believe are\ncritical to understanding the development of Mare\nSerenitatis.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9chigh lava mark\xe2\x80\x9d on the inner wall of the crater. No\nevidence of fracturing or buckling of mare material is\napparent along the albedo boundary, as would be\nexpected if it were a structurally produced hinge line.\nThe dark fill in and near the Apollo 17 landing site\nis topographically lower than the dark border fill on\nthe southern side of Mare Serenitatis. We have been\nunable to identify faults of sufficient magnitude to\naccount for this elevation difference. The dark mantle\non highland material in this area is not as conspicuous\nin these low-Sun-angle photographs as it is in the\n\nDARK MARGIN AND CENTRAL\nMARE F I L L\nIn figure 30-9, the contact relation between the\nlight central fill and the marginal dark border fill is\nclearly shown. In addition to the obvious albedo\ndifference, a contrast in surface texture is evident.\nImpact cratering and ridges on the light central fill\nappear crisp, whereas many craters, ridges, and rilles\nin the dark border appear softer and more subdued.\nThe boundary between the light and dark fill corresponds to a distinct break in slope and has the general\ncharacter of a shoreline. The relatively flat, smooth\nsurface of the light-colored material enters small\nembayments in the inclined, undulating surface of the\ndark border material. A crater, approximately 10 km\nin diameter (lower center, fig. 30-9), is partly\ninundated by the light central fill, which has left a\n\naWoods Hole OceanographicInstitution.\n\n20\n\n0\n\nkm\n\nFIGURE 3@9.-Southern margin of central light fill in Mare\nSerenitatis. Note sharp to degraded tensional faults in\ndark border material, concentric and radial wrinkle ridges\nin light mare material, and subdued extension of radial\nwrinkle ridges into dark border material (Apollo 17\nmetric camera frame AS17-0451).\n\n30-10\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nApollo 15 photographs, which were made at a higher\nSun angle.\n\nLAVA AND EXTRUSIVE VENTS\nEAST OF DAWES CENTER\nOn the southeastern side of Mare Serenitatis (fig.\n30-lo), graben fractures in the dark border are buried\nbeneath lighter colored mare material, evidently a\nlate-stage flow, which appears to have originated\noutside the mare and flowed down the duping dark\nborder surface, following a shallow depression in this\nsurface. This flow appears on the lower left side of\nfigure 30-10. Howard et al. (part A of sec. 29) have\ncalled it the Dawes basalt. Two rille-like features on\nits surface converge on a line of four vents 1 to 2 km\nin diameter.\nTwo of these vents (B in fig. 30-10) are cones\ndistinct in their morphology from the many small\nimpact craters of similar diameter adjacent to them\non the Dawes basalt surface. The northern cone is\nbreached on its downslope side, as would be expected\nof a cone serving as a vent for lava flow. A very faint,\nrille-like channel can be traced for approximately 10\nkm downslope from this cone. Both this cone and the\nlarger southern cone are distinct, raised mounds with\nrounded rims and crater floors that are above the\ngeneral surface of the surrounding basalt. Internal and\nexternal slopes are approximately equal. These features are typical of terrestrial volcanic cinder cones,\nin which the cone is a positive addition of material\ncomposed of ejected debris around a relatively small\ncentral vent. In contrast, the nearby small impact\ncraters are steep-walled, conical pits with sharp rims\nand outer walls sloping much more gently than the\ninner walls; they are predominantly negative relief\nfeatures representing excavation and dispersion of\nsurface material. Applying these criteria, we feel\nconfident that these two cones are extrusive volcanic\nfeatures. The larger southern cone, approximately 1.5\nkm wide at its base and approximately 300 m high, is\nalmost identical in size and shape to Sunset Crater in\nArizona (ref. 30-6). The northern cone is slightly\nsmaller, measuring approximately 1 km across its base\nand approximately 200 m high. A smaller cone\napproximately 5 km to the northwest may be a small\nsatellite to this larger cone. Two irregular, pitted\nmounds between the northern and southern cinder\ncones may also be vents but do not show well-defined\nconical morphology.\n\n20\n\n0\n\nkm\n\nFIGURE 30-10.-Southeastern margin of Mare Serenitatis,\nshowing margin of lava flow mantling dark borders (A),\npossible breached cinder cones (B), and collapsed and\npartly buried lava tube (C) (Apollo 17 metric camera\nframe AS17-0447).\n\nThe Dawes basalt can be distinguished from the\nadjacent dark mantle by its smoother surface, in\nwhich it resembles the central fill of Mare Serenitatis.\nThe surface of the flow is slightly convex, with a\nsubtle break in slope coinciding with the change from\nthe smoother Dawes basalt surface to the more\nhummocky surface of the dark mantle. Albedo\ndifferences are slight, but the Dawes basalt appears to\nbe slightly lighter in color. The boundaries of the\nDawes basalt shown by Howard et al. (part A of sec.\n\nVOLCANIC\nSTUDIES\n\n30-11\n\n29, fig. 29-5) are in reasonable\nagreement with the\nboundary\nindicated\nas "A" in figure 30-10. Dawes\nimpact debris tends to obscure contact relations along\nthe western\nside of the Dawes basalt, and contact\nrelations\nbetween\nthe Dawes and the light central\n\nfollow preexisting zones of weakness in the rock. This\nprinciple may explain both the large-scale and finescale patterns of fracturing, as well as the difference\nin response of the light and dark t_dl. Broad welts\nprobably develop above preexisting zones of deforma-\n\nSerenitatis fill are also extremely\nsubtle.\nThe Dawes basalt is cut by several sharp rifts or\nlines of small pit craters that follow the general trend\nof the buried graben fractures. A larger, elongated pit\non the left side of the lava flow is partly Idled by\nponded\nlava. It is alined with a small depression\nupslope and with irregular, rough features downslope\nthat resemble partly collapsed domes or vent structures (C in fig. 30-10). These features may represent a\n\ntion in older buried mare fill, because less energy is\nexpended in this way than in deforming previously\nundisturbed\ncrust, especially if the same stress pattern\ncontinues to operate. For the same reason, the more\nintense crumpling\nproduced\nby continued\ndeformation is mainly localized along the crests of the broad\nwelts. In detail, the intense crumpling developed by\ndisplacement\naround\ncrustal\nblocks\nbounded\nby\nfractures or joints spaced at 1 to 4 km. The existence\nof these coherent blocks suggests that wrinkle ridge\ndeformation\ntook place before impact events had\nbrecciated\nthe surface and created a deep regolith.\nThe absence of sharp, angular\nridges in the dark\n\nlarge, partly collapsed\nlava tube that\nsource of some of the central mare t111.\nSTRUCTURAL\nGraben-like\nborder material\n\ncould\n\nbe\n\na\n\nFEATURES\n\ndues are conspicuous\nin the dark\n(fig. 30-9). One of the sharpest and\n\nfreshest of these grabens can be traced across the\nsouthern wall and floor of the large, partly drowned\nimpact crater on the light-dark "shoreline,"\nand thus\nis younger than the crater. In contrast, the blurred\nand degraded appearance\nof other grabens suggests\nthat they are older features. These grabens crosscut\nhighland material but are truncated\nor buried by the\nlight central fill of Mare Serenitatis,\nas discussed in\npart A of section 29.\nWrinkle ridges are prominent\nin the light central\nflU of Mare Serenitatis\n(fig. 30-9). These have been\ndiscussed by Bryan (ref. 30-7) and by Howard and\nMuehlberger\n(part C of sec. 31), who attribute them\nto compressional\ndeformation.\nThere is a distinct\nchange in the character of wrinkle ridge deformation\nbetween the light fill and dark border material where\nthe radial ridges cross the light-dark boundary. Within\nthe light fill, the ridges are broad, convex swells,\ncommonly\ntopped\nby intensely\ncrumpled,\nsharp\nridges. Some sharp ridges also appear to develop\nindependently\nof preexisting\nswells. However, the\nsharp crumbling\nterminates\nabruptly\nat the albedo\nboundary,\nand the ridges continue\ninto the dark\nborder\ncentral\ntoothed\nrotation\nto 4 km\n\nas low, undulating\nswells. Within the light\nFill, many of the sharp ridges have a sawor zigzag pattern resulting from tilting and\nof distinct blocky crustal units measuring 1\non a side.\n\nLaboratory\nexperiments\non fracturing\nof basalt\n(ref. 30-8) have shown that induced fractures tend to\n\nborder material\nmay indicate that it consists of a\nrelatively deep friable or highly brecciated\nregolith,\nwhich would tend to dissipate deforming stresses over\nmany small-scale intergranular\nfractures.\n\nVOLCANIC\n\nAND STRUCTURAL\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nThe sharp and relatively straight light-dark boundary relationship\nalong the southern\nedge of Mare\nSerenitatis\nis difficult to explain if the dark material\nis assumed to be a younger deposit that covers the\nlighter fill. If the dark material consisted\nof young\nlava flows, these should produce\na much more\nirregular, scalloped boundary,\nwhich is not observed.\nIf the dark material were a young ash deposit, the\nboundary should be much less distinct. The shoreline\nrelation,\nin which light material embays the dark\nmaterial, indicates that it onlaps a preexisting sloping\nsurface\non the dark border\nmaterial.\nThe most\nreasonable\ninterpretation\nis that the central, lightcolored material is a younger mare fill that accumulated in a depression\nformed by isostatic subsidence\nof the older, dark \xc2\xa3dl. Although many workers have\nstated that\nthe dark margin is relatively\nyoung,\nHoward et al. (part A of see. 29) have reviewed the\nassumptions\nleading to this interpretation\nand also\nconclude that the dark margin represents the earliest\nfilling of Mare Serenitatis. They note the similarity in\ncolor and albedo of the dark surfaces at the Apollo\n11 and 17 landing sites and along the southern margin\nof Mare Serenitatis;\nthis similarity in appearance\nalso\n\n30-12\n\nAPOLLO\n17PRELIMINARY\nSCIENCE\nREPORT\n\nsuggests\nsimilarcompositionnd ageof surface\na\nmaterial all of these locations.\nat\nThe distinctly\n\nlower elevation\n\nof the dark border\n\nmaterial at the Apollo 17 landing site compared to\nthat of the southern side of Mare Serenitatis suggests\nthat the dark material did not well up within the\nmare basin and overflow into adjacent valleys and\ninto Mare Tranquillitatis. It seems more likely that\nthe dark material originated in the highland valleys\nand flowed into the mare, much like the more recent\nDawes basalt. These many independent flows would\nthen have established\ntheir own local base levels\nwhere\n\nthey\n\nare ponded\n\nor deflected\n\nby intervening\n\nhighland barriers.\nDuring and following\nthis initial basin filling,\ncollapse of the central part of the mare caused local\nmarginal tension, producing a series of arcuate graben\nfaults. Low swells and crenulations radial to the mare\ncenter may have also formed at this time.\nevents created a deep regolith on the dark\nmaterial. Filling of the mare basin continued,\nsource and mechanism remain obscure. The\n\nImpact\nborder\nbut the\nDawes\n\nbasalt may represent a late-stage contribution to this\nfill. This light fill onlapped the sloping dark border,\ndrowning preexisting grabens and impact craters. A\n"high lava mark" present locally suggests the occurrence of some drainback from the margins, implying\nvents within the mare, thermal shrinkage, or an early\nsubsidence event shortly after ponding of the lava.\nContinued\ncollapse of the central part of Mare\nSerenitatis caused compressional\ndeformation of the\ncrust, first forming low linear swells and welts, then\nmore intense crumpling of the crust along crests of\nthe welts. Some of this deformation extended\ninto\nthe dark margin,\nzones of weakness\nresponse\n\npossibly localized by preexisting\nin the old fill. Differences in the\n\nof the light and dark material to deforma-\n\ntional stresses indicate that the dark margin is much\nmore incoherent\nthan the light t"111, hich tends to\nw\nfracture around distinct blocky units. This difference\nsuggests that the light fill was relatively fresh, brittle\nrock at the time of deformation,\nwhereas the dark\nborder\nmay have been much more brecciated\nby\nimpact events over an extended period.\nLate-stage gas eruptions in the Taurus-Littrow\narea\nmay have redistributed\nbrecciated dark mantle as ash,\nas suggested\nby EI-Baz (ref. 30-9).\nSome such\nmechanism\nseems necessary to explain the distribution of dark mantle over highland areas, but we have\nnot identified\ncinder cones like those on the Dawes\nbasalt. Possibly, much of this material was distributed\nby impact events. Although we do not exclude the\npossibility of volcanic activity associated with wrinkle\nridges, the morphology\nof the ridges in the southern\npart of Mare Serenitatis\nis indicative\nof warped,\ncrumpled,\nand broken surface crust rather than of\nfreshly extruded volcanic material.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Apollo 17 metric camera photographs\nprovide\ndefinitive evidence for a sequence of volcanic and\nstructural\nevents associated with the development\nof\nMare Serenitatis.\nThese events are relevant to the\ninterpretation\nof other orbital science experiments\nand to samples of dark border material collected at\nApollo landing sites. Cinder cones associated with\nvolcanic vents on the Dawes basalt are similar in size\nand shape to typical terrestrial cinder cones. Detailed\nmorphology\nof deformational\nfeatures produced by\nboth tensional and compressional\nstresses suggests\ndistinct differences\nin physical properties of the\ncentral light fill and dark border material.\n\nVOLCANIC\n\nSTUDIES\n\nPART\n"D-CALDERA":\n\nNEW\n\n30-13\n\nD\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS\n\nOF A UNIQUE\n\nFEATURE\n\nFarouk El-Baz a\n\nA unique D-shaped structure at latitude 18040 \' N,\nlongitude 05\xc2\xb020 \' Ewas discovered during the Apollo\n15 mission\nwithin\none of several smooth,\ndark\npatches in the hilly region between Montes Haemus\nand Montes Apenninus. Its unusual shape and interior\nmorphology\nhave generated\nmuch interest\namong\nselenologists\n(refs. 30-10 and 30-11). Orbital photographs and visual observations\n(see. 28)were planned\nfor the Apollo\n17 mission to acquire additional\ninformation\npertaining\nto the setting and detailed\ncharacteristics\nof this structure.\nPhotographs\nof the\narea were obtained by using the metric and Hasselblad cameras (with both color and high-speed blackand-white\nfdm); no panoramic\ncamera photography\nof the region was planned because the area had been\nadequately\ncovered with the same camera during the\nApollo 15 mission. The purpose of this report is to\ngive a brief description\nof the Apollo 17 photographs\nof the D-shaped structure and its surroundings.\nThe patches\nof dark material\nbetween\nMontes\nHaemus and Montes Apenninus are separated by hilly\nand rugged units that are segmented\nby fractures\nradial to Mare Imbrium.\nTwo of these fractures\n\nThe D-shaped structure\nis a depression, 2 km wide\nand 3 km long. The feature is approximately\n300 m\ndeep and displays a raised rim that is 1.5 km wide.\nThe floor is occupied by two different morphological\nunits:\n1. A fiat unit that\n\nis subdivided\n\ninto two albedo\n\nunits, gray and white; the latter forms an annulus\naround the gray unit (ref. 30-11). Apollo 17 visual\nobservations\n(see. 28) and color photographs\nindicate\nthat the whole floor has a bluish tone.\n2. Approximately\nbous structures\nof\n\n50 disconnected,\nsmooth, bulvarious sizes; these structures\n\nproduce a blister-like appearance.\nThere is a 1-km-diameter\n\ncrater\n\nwest\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nD-shaped structure\nthat, before the Apollo 17 mission, was believed to have a dark halo. The Apollo 17\nlow-Sun photographs\nindicate that the darkening is\nprobably due to slope effects; the crater is near the\nborder of an 18-km-wide\ndome that encircles the\nD-shaped\n\nstructure\n\n(fig. 30-12(b))\n\nand that appears\n\nto\n\nhave fewer craters on it than on the surrounding mare\n(fig. 30-12(c)).\nIt is proposed\nthat the D-shaped\nstructure\nis a collapse\ncaldera atop an extrusive\n\nbound the area of the D-shaped structure. The Apollo\n17 low-Sun photographs\nof the area indicate that a\nhorst, at least 150 km long and 30 km wide (fig.\n30-11), has been uplifted relative to the surroundings.\nThe fault on the western side of the horst continues\n\nvolcanic\ninformal\n\nsouthward\ninto eastern Mare Vaporum, as suggested\nby a prominent mare ridge system (fig. 30-11).\nThe dark patches filling the valleys between the\nfoothills\nof the mountains\nhave been previously\nmapped as Imbrian mare material (ref. 30-12). Flow\nstructures\nand collapse\ndepressions\nevident in the\nApollo 17 low-Sun photographs\nfurther suggest that\nthey may be basalt flows (fig. 30-12(a)).\nThus, the\n\n1.

Schabet a\n\nOrbital photographs\ntaken at low-Sun illumination\nduring both the Apollo 15 (ref. 30-14) and Apollo 17\nmissions have provided excellent\ndata on the lava\nflows in southwestern\nMare Imbrium. These photographs have been used recently to present a detailed\nphotogeologic\nevaluation of these flows and their role\nin mare volcanism of Eratosthenian\nage in the basin\n(ref. 30-15). Eruption of these flood basalts apparently took place in at least three major episodes with\nsuggested dates of 3.0 + 0.4 billion years (phase I),\n2.7 -+0.3 billion years (phase II), and 2.5 -+0.3 billion\nyears (phase III) using the mare age-dating method\ndescribed by Soderblom\nand Lebofsky (ref. 30-16)\nand recent\ndata by Soderblom\nand Boyce (ref.\n30-17). 1\n\naU.S. Geological Survey.\n1The method involves visual examination of an orbital\nphotograph to determine the maximum diameter D s of\ncraters the internal slopes of which have been reduced to\nslopes less than the Sun elevation angle S s. Using the\nSoderblom (tel 30-18) model of small crater impact erosion,\nmeasurements of Ds are converted to an equivalent diameter\nDL of a crater eroded to an interior slope of 1\xc2\xb0 under the\nsame flux that has eroded a crater of diameter Ds to a slope\nof Ss. Values of DL are considered synonymous with relative\nage, which is directly proportional to the total number of\ncraters that have accumulated on the surface. The DL values\nmeasured for the three phases of Eratosthenian basalts in\nMare Imbrium are 235 \xc2\xb1 20, 175 \xc2\xb1 5, and 160 \xc2\xb1 5 m, respectively. The DL value for the youngest flows is in agreement\nwith that of Boyce and Dial (part C of see. 29).\n\nThe lavas of the Eratosthenian\neruptive phases\nflowed directly toward the center of the Imbrium\nbasin with the earliest (phase I) materials pooling, in\nwhat must have been the lowest portion,\nnear the\nbreached southeastern\nrim of the Sinus Iridum Crater\n(fig. 30-14). Present topography\nof the basin shows\nthat this region is still the lowest point (ref. 30-20).\nThe average surface slopes from the volcanic source\nregion southwest\nof Euler Crater to the basin center\nare estimated to be between 1 :100 and 1 : 1000. Lavas\nassigned to the three eruptive phases extended\nfor\n1200, 600, and 400 km, respectively,\nindicating\na\nmarked decrease in lava volume available for extrusion between 3.0 and 2.5 billion years. Flow thicknesses and areal extent indicate that a minimum of\n4.0 \xc3\x97 104 km a of mare material covering an area\n2.0 \xc3\x97 l0 s km 2 was probably\ndeposited\nin\nImbrium basin during this 0.5-billion-year\ninterval.\nThe youngest lavas (phase III) have been traced\na possible\nsource\nfissure at latitude\n22050 \'\nlongitude\n31020 \' W (fig. 30-15,\nlower left).\n\nof\nthe\nto\nN,\nA\n\nvery.low-albedo,\nlinear cinder cone complex on the\nsoutheastern\nend of the island Euler/_ trends northeast-southwest\nand may be structurally\nrelated to the\ninferred eruptive vent (fig. 30-16).

The locus of this volcanic province may\nhave been determined by the intersection of major\nring faults (fig. 30-14) concentric to the Imbrium\nbasin and to the poorly defined basin centered about\nthe crater Copernicus (ref. 30-19). Latham et al. (ref.\n30-21) have recently identified nine currently active\nlunar seismic areas with focuses at 600- to 1000-km\ndepths. The epicenter of one of these regions coincides with the proposed fissure vent described here.\n\nThis location is probably not fortuitous; at the time\nof Eratosthenian volcanism in the Imbrium basin.\nbasin ring fractures perhaps acted as conduits for the\nmagmas generated at depth. Partial melting may still\nbe taking place on a small scale at depths of 1000 km.\nStresses resulting from this process may accumulate\nin the basin ring fractures and may be released by\ncyclic tidal forces, which Latham et al. (ref. 30-21)\nsuggest as a triggering mechanism of internal lunar\nseismicity.\nSeven of the nine active lunar seismic regions\nsuggested by Latham and his colleagues are associated\nwith basin rings or regions of intersection of two or\nmore basins. This association appears t o fit a relationship between concentric basin structures and major\ndark mantlelmare plateau volcanic provinces (ref.\n30-22).\nPhotogrammetric measurements of the phase I11\nflow scarps indicate common average heights of 30 to\n35 m with a range over a variety of flows from 10 to\n63 m (fig. 30-15). Detailed study of the relationships\nbetween flow lobes and associated mare ridges indicates that not all ridges completely postdate the\neruptive events. Several of the ridges existed on the\npreflow surface, although with less complexity and\nlower topographic profile. The presence of leveed\nflow channels at mare ridge crests and ponding of lava\nagainst preflow mare ridge slopes are direct evidence\nof this relationship (fig. 30-20). The leveed channels\nwere probably created by rapid, constricted flow\nduring overflow of a lava lake ponded behind the\n\n30-20\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n3\n\n0\n\n10\nkrn\n\n20\n\nFIGURE 30-17.-South-looking oblique photograph showing the suggested regional volcanic source\narea for all Eratosthenian-age mare lavas in the Imbrium basin.

The largest ridge northeast of Mons L Hire\na\nbest illustrates the evidence for pre-phase II ridge\ntopography with the dike-like, sinuous features on\nthe ridge crest probably formed in the post-phase I11\nperiod (figs. 30-20, 30-21(a), and 30-21(b)). Growth\nof this particular ridge may have begun in Imbrian\ntime. Present photogeologic evidence indicates that\nthe flows surmounted slopes of at least 0.5\'. Postflow\nnormal faulting with displacements of at least 145 m\nis present in the ridge system approximately 60 km\nnorth of Euler fl (fig. 30-15).\nSubdued, 1- to 2-km-wide and 40- to 50-m-deep,\nleveed channels are present lengthwise along the\ncenter of the most extensive phase I11 flows (fig.\n30-15). This type of lava channel is common in\nterrestrial basalt flows, but the lunar channels are\nseveral orders of magnitude larger. The braided law\nchannels in a complex series just north of the\nsuggested phase I11 source vent are on the order of\n400 to 800 m wide and 40 to 70 m deep (fig. 30-22).\nLunar application of the equations of Shaw and\nSwanson (ref. 30-23) and Dane3 (ref. 30-24) has\nshown that, even on nearly horizontal slopes, the\n\nFIGURE 30-19.-Nikon 35-mm photograph showing arcuate\nvolcanic cinder cone complex with associated lava flows\n(AS17-155-23738).

In addition, the high rates\nof lava extrusion appear to be the primary cause of\nextreme flow lengths; the reduced viscosity of lunar\nbasalts (ref. 30-4) probably plays a secondary role.\nThe orbital photographic documentation of southern Mare Imbrium begun by the Apollo 15 crewmen\nand completed by the Apollo 17 crewmen has\nenabled photogeologists to understand more clearly\nat least those volcanic processes that resulted in\nlate-stage mare flooding. The distinct lava flows in the\nImbrium basin were recognized as perhaps the best\npreserved result of such processes (ref. 30-25); until\nthe Apollo missions, however, photographic resolution and quantitative topographic data were insufficient for a thorough evaluation.\n\nREFERENCES\n30-1.

These relationships indicate that ridge\nvolcanism or deformation followed rille formation.\nMare ridges exhibit a variety of temporal relationships with mare surface flows, rilles, and fractures.\nNear the Herigonius rille complex, the two larger\nnorthwest-southeast trending ridges that have sinuous\nrille vents located along their summits appear to have\ndeflected or otherwise influenced the development of\n\nthe sinuous rilles and, by inference, the flows in\nwhich they formed (fig. 31-3). The rilles closely\nfollow the prominent ridge in area A (fig. 31-3), and\nthey also show deformation along the ridge flank near\nthe rille junction. The rille that issues near area B (fig.\n31-1) and crosses the most prominent ridge without\nconspicuous deformation suggests that flow may have\npersisted across a low section of the initial ridge while\nridge formation continued, eventually producing a\ncomplex vent that fed rilles extending both north and\nsouth. Deformation of the ridge appears to have\nclosed off a portion of the vent system in area C (fig.\n\n31-4\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n-\n\n0\n\n15\n\nkm\n\nFIGURE 31-3.-Herigonius rille complex: (A) rille trend influenced by preexisting ridge; (B) areas\nwhere ridge growth has deformed rilles; and (C) rille sections showing deformation or filling across\nridge (Apollo 16 metric camera frame AS16-2837).\n\n31-1) with a resulting shift of activity to the\nnortheast edge of the ridge at area B. Alternatively,\nlava could have poured out along the entire straight\nsection of the rille at area E. A minor obstruction\n(intrusion?) in the rille where it crosses the large ridge\ncan be seen in area E (fig. 31-1). Northwest of this\n\ncomplex vent (fig. 31-1, B), portions of the rilles that\ncross smaller ridge segments near area B (fig. 31-3)\nclearly show ridge deformation postdating the development of the rilles.\nThe long prominent rille near the crater Brayley\nexhibits a \xe2\x80\x9cbraided\xe2\x80\x9d or bifurcating character near\n\nMARE RIDGES AND RELATED STUDIES\nseveral ridge-crossing segments (fig. 3 1-2). These\nmultiple channels could possibly have formed when\nridge tectonism or volcanism caused subtle surface\ndeformation, or they might be the result of multiple\nfeeder vents near the ridge systems (fig. 31-2).\nAlong the mare ridge system in Mare Serenitatis\nnear the crater Littrow, there is evidence of local\nflows from several parts of the ridge partly filling\nadjacent craters of various sizes (fig. 314). The same\nrelationship between ridges and adjacent craters is\nevident along the ridge system in eastern Mare\nCognitum in the general vicinity of the crater\nBonpland D. These ridgelcrater relationships in both\ncases imply a significant interval for cratering of the\nadjacent surfaces before renewed (secondary) volcanism along the ridges. This conclusion is based on\nthe assumption that the main portion of the ridge\n\n3 1-5\n\ndeveloped contemporaneously with the surface flows\nin these areas; however, the entire ridge might, in\nfact, be considerably younger than the surrounding\nflows.\nAll these relationships demonstrate that mare\nridges have complex origins in time. Some retain\ntopographic expression during two or more episodes\nof adjacent mare flooding and serve to channel or\ndirect flows. Others are submerged temporarily by\nyounger flows and later deform the surface by\nextrusive, intrusive, and tectonic activity. Still other\nridges might have developed their present topographic\nexpression entirely during one limited episode of\nmare flooding. The evidence suggests most strongly\nthat repetitive deformation and volcanism along\nprernare basement fractures have formed the mare\nridges.\nAlthough mare ridge development can occur before, during, and after the extrusion of the adjacent\nmare surface flows, the latest surficial activity observable along many ridges appears to have accompanied\nor followed local mare flow extrusion and rille\ndevelopment.\nThe interrelated nature of sinuous mare rilles,\nridges, and flows is clearly illustrated northwest of\nthe crater Euler (fig. 31-5) where both well-defined\nsurface flows and associated rilles have been deformed by ridge development before all the features\nwere in turn offset by prominent northeast-southwest\ntrending faults or flexures. (Similar relationships are\nshown in fig. 3 1-1 1 .) All these relationships are best\ndemonstrated on stereographic photographs.\n\nAGES OF MARE FAULTS AND\nFRACTURE SYSTEMS\n\n15\n\n0\n\nkm\n\nFIGURE 314.-Mare ridges west of crater Littrow in Mare\nSerenitatis.

A portion of the northern rim slumped or\nslid into the interior, forming an irregular deposit of\ndebris at the base of the inner wall. The western rim\nhas been partly destroyed and subsequently breached\nby mare material that partly fills the crater floor. The\nlevel of the mare surface to the west is higher than\nthe floor of Krieger, which suggests that mare\nmaterial has flooded the crater through a low point in\nthe western rim, with the source of the mare material\nbeing extzrior to the crater. However, the rille that\nextends from the gap in the western rim out onto the\nmare surface is widest at the gap and narrows\nprogressively away from the gap into the mare. In\nmany terrestrial lava channels, the width decreases\naway from the source. Similar relationships can be\nobserved in several sinuous rilles along the southern\nportion of figure 31-9. Therefore, it is also possible\nthat the source of mare flow material on the floor of\nthe crater lies within Krieger and that the difference\nin elevation between the crater floor and mare\nsurfaces is the result of postvolcanic subsidence of the\ncrater floor.\nThe overall result of these processes is the rapid\ndestruction of the crater ejecta rim, especially its\ncircular form.\n\nHerigonius v Crater\nThe northwestern half of Herigonius v (fig. 3 1-10)\nis bounded by a rim that varies in both width and\nheight and that grades into an isolated highland area.\nThe northeastern tip of this rim segment has been cut\nby a short high-angle fault. The eastern side of this\nfaulted tip has moved relatively upward with respect\nto the western side. The entire northwestern half of\nthe crater rim appears to be of impact origin. The\nsoutheastern half of the crater rim is low and narrow\nand barely protrudes above the surface of the mare\nmaterial that both fills and surrounds the crater. The\neastern side of this low, narrow rim segment has been\npartly destroyed by a cluster of secondary impact\ncraters.\nIt seems improbable that impact, mass-wasting,\nand tectonic processes would have reduced only the\nsoutheastern portion of the rim to such a uniform\nconfiguration. A more likely possibility is that, after\nthis portion of the original ejecta rm was partially\ni\ndestroyed by the aforementioned processes and then\ninundated by mare lavas, subsequent fissure volcanism-along a nearly circular fracture produced by the\ninitial impact-formed the present low, narrow rim.\nThis lower segment of the rim resembles the nearly\nlinear low ridge that lies approximately one crater\ndiameter to the west. T h s ridge is also narrow and\nappears to fill a portion of a fracture. An intrusive\norigin for this ridge seems likely. The smoothly\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n31-10\n\nu\n15\n\n0\n\nkm\n\nFIGURE 31-lO.-Crater Herigonius u northeast of Herigonius\nrille complex: (A) fault (Apollo 16 metric camera frame\nAS 16-2834).\n\ncurved form of the southeastern rim segment of\nHerigonius v in contrast to the more irregular\nnorthwestern portion can easily be accounted for if\nthey are volcanic and impact features, respectively.\nEjecta rims are prominent topographic features and as\nsuch are subject to erosion by mass wasting and\nyounger impacts. However, impact fractures would be\naffected only by much larger impacts and not at all\nby most minor surface processes, and subsequent\nvolcanism along the impact fractures could reconstruct a secondary volcanic rim almost circular in\nshape.\nThe low topographic expression of the southeastern portion of the crater rim and the absence of\nobvious flow features suggest that the main sources of\nmagma lay outside the crater. Isostatic uplift of the\ncrater floor may in part account for the difference in\nelevation between it and the mare surface immediately to the southeast.\n\nLambert R Crater\nThe ring complex of Lambert R (fig. 31-11)\nexhibits many of the characteristics also seen in other\n\nlunar ring structures, particularly the circular form.\nEvidence of volcanic activity exists in the form of\nsinuous rilles (northwestern portion) and flow features, including flow fronts (southern portion). A\nsmall, narrow, arcuate ridge segment similar in morphology to that previously described in figure 13-10\nis located just outside the southeastern portion of\nLambert R (fig. 31-11, C). It exhibits a concentric\nrelationship with the ring complex. Tectonism as well\nas volcanism along the structure may be partly\nresponsible for differences in elevation between the\ninterior and the surrounding mare. Some flexuring is\napparent on the eastern side.\nThe existence of the sinuous rille that crosses the\nnorthwestern rim in area A of figure 31-11 suggests\nthat the last major episode of volcanism may have\ninundated that portion of the ring. Later, smallerscale eruptions could have reestablished the ring. The\npresence of material filling the portion of the rille\nthat crosses the ring supports this interpretation.\nOnly along the southwestern side is there any\nsuggestion of a possible relict ejecta rim. The hills\nwith high albedo in that region resemble terra\nmaterial and are similar to those around the Flamsteed P ring described in references 31-8 and 31-9.\nThey appear to be more densely cratered than the\nadjacent mare; the abundant clusters of secondary\ncraters make this comparison somewhat uncertain,\nhowever. Carr (ref. 31-10) mapped these hills as rim\nejecta.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe filing of the lunar maria and the contemporaneous development of distinctive surface features\nhave involved volcanism and tectonism along premare\nbasement fractures to form mare ridges and fault\nsystems as well as primary surface features such as\nsinuous rilles (collapsed lava tubes) and volcanic\nflows. In general, mare ridges appear to have undergone continued deformation or growth by tectonic\nand volcanic processes (extrusive and intrusive) after\nthe surrounding mare surface flows were extruded.\nHowever, in some cases, portions of mare ridges were\nobviously present as topographic prominences when\nthe surrounding flows were extruded.\nThe modification of impact craters by other\nimpacts, mass wasting, tectonism, and volcanism has,\nin certain cases, been followed by reestablishment of\ncircular ridge systems above flooded premare craters\nof impact origin.\n\nMARE RIDGES AND RELATED STUDIES\n\n31-11\n\n15\n\n0\nkm\n\nFIGURE 31-1 1.-Crater Lambert R in Mare Imbrium: (A) sinuous rille showing alteration along crater\nedge; (B) arcuate rille deformed by ridge; and (C) intrusive(?) ridge element (Apollo 17 metric\ncamera frame AS17-2286).\n\nAll these features developed over an extended\nperiod and show complex interrelations in time and\nspace.

Similarities to structures documented in Hawaiian lava lakes suggest that some mare\nridges may have formed as \xe2\x80\x9csqueeze-ups\xe2\x80\x9d and autointrusives in tension fractures over buried topography\nin the crusts of lunar lava lakes; less obvious are those\nthat may have formed at the junctures of moving\nplates of crustal lava. As with most lunar/terrestrial\nanalogies, however, the discrepancy in scale is enormous.\n\nothers are strongly asymmetric; in many cases,\napparent fault scarps bound one side (fig. 31-13).\nProminent ridges occur in patterns approximately\nconcentric to the circular mare basins, as exemplified\nin Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium (part D of sec. 29),\nand Humorum; the ridges are assumed to mark\npositions of the basin inner rings (ref. 31-17). The\ninfluence of submare topography on the localization\nof ridges is demonstrated by those ridges over buried\ncrater rims, as in figures 31-14(a) and 31-15; the\nridges are distinct, raised structures and not merely\nmantled rims. A larger example occurs at Sinus\nIridum where a prominent ridge overlies the buried\npart of the post-Imbrium Iridum crater. Many ridges,\nhowever, show no obvious relation to buried topography or to known structural control and commonly\nform complex, braided networks.

Structures forming on a\ncirculating lava lake in Mauna Ulu were documented\nby Duffield (ref. 31-18). Active circulation of the\nmelt prevented formation of a stable crust, and the\nthin (< 2 cm, ref. 31-18) chilled surface was continuously broken, rafted, and eventually resorbed in the\nmolten lava. Crustal plates migrated away from zones\nof magmatic upwelling and overrode one another at\nzones of crustal convergence, with concomitant formation of ridges in upper plates and \xe2\x80\x9csqueeze-outs\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nof lava at the junctures (figs. 31-16 and 31-17). The\nmorphologies of these ephemeral features resemble in\n\nFIGURE 31-17.-Mauna Ulu lava lake, Hawaii.

If lava lakes existed in some parts of the\nmaria and if circulation of lava continued after the\nlakes crusted over, ridges might have formed where\ncrustal fragments were rafted against or over one\nanother. The preservation of such structures analogous to the ephemeral ridges at Mauna Ulu (figs.\n31-16 and 31-17) seems problematic, but if circulation were sluggish enough and the crust thick enough,\nthe process might be applicable to the formation of\n\nMARE RIDGES AND RELATED STUDIES\n\n31-15\n\nFIGURE 31-19.-Alae lava lake, Hawaii.

Originally a\n165-m-deep pit crater, Alae was filled to overflowing\nby lava from the Mauna Ulu eruptions of 1969-71;\npartial drainage occurred by way of a lava tube,\ncausing the chilled crust on the lake to subside.\nExtension structures-such as concentric cracks,\ngraben, and normal faults-formed over the preexisting crater rim and over an older, more deeply buried\ninner rim as well (fig. 31-18). The central subsidence\nbowl became a zone of compression, but, instead of\nsimply buckling, the crust broke into thrust plates\n(fig. 31-19), and prominent ridges formed lobate and\nboxwork patterns at the margins of the overriding\nplates (ref. 31-19, figs. 31-19 and 31-20).\nThe geographical relationship of tensional and\ncompressional zones at Alae contrasts with the\nproposal that buried topography localized compressional structures on the Moon as mare lavas subsided\n(ref. 3 1-13). Furthermore, the compressional ridges at\nAlae did not form the en echelon patterns typical of\nmany lunar ridges, whereas the extensional fractures\nand faults over the buried crater rims did develop en\n\nFIGURE 31-20.-Alae lava lake, Hawaii.

In lunar lava lakes, crustal\nsubsidence may have caused intrusion and extrusion\nof underlying molten lava into and onto the solidi-\n\n31-16\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nfied, sagging crust through tensional fracture systems;\nresulting landforms might be analogous to terrestrial\nlaccoliths and squeeze-ups (refs. 3 1-7 and 31-20).\nAccording to Duffield and Nakamura (ref. 3 1-21),\nen echelon faults and fractures may be caused by\ndilation in a direction oblique to the trend of the\nfault zone and approximately normal to lines of\nrupture. Unlike such fractures related to transcurrent\nfaulting, those caused by tension are characterized by\nthe contemporaneous development of right-lateral\n(dextral) and left-lateral (sinistral) patterns\xe2\x80\x99 (fig.\n31-21). Such an extensional en echelon pattern is\nexemplified by the Koae fault system at Kilauea (ref.\n31-21). If, on the Moon, such fractures localized\nextrusions, then tension rather than transcurrent\nfaulting at depth (ref. 31-16) might explain ridges\nwhere both sinistral and dextral patterns occur along\nthe same structural trend (fig. 3 1-22).\nPossible evidence for an autointrusive or squeezeup origin may be the circular ridges over buried crater\nrims (figs. 31-14 and 31-15), which are similar in\nshape to larger linear ridges; these are not readily\nexplained by either transcurrent faulting or lateral\ncompression. Commonly, as at Lambert R (figs.\n31-14(a) and 31-14(b)), such ridges are narrow and\ndiscontinuous, suggesting extrusive squeeze-ups along\nen echelon cracks. Very small flooded craters seem to\nshow a gradational sequence from rimmed depressions, which appear only as mantled topography (fig.\n3 1-23), to those where marginal fracturing occurs at\nthe rim (fig. 31-24), and others in which ridges have\nformed at the rim (fig. 31-15). This apparent sequence, as well as the high degree of circularity and\ncommon preservation of rim remnants (fig. 31-14(a)),\nseems to preclude formation of many circular ridges\nas deeply rooted volcanic \xe2\x80\x9cring dikes.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA squeeze-up model might also explain the broad\narches topped by wrinkle ridges. If the crust above\nlaccolithic autointrusives were broken by axial tension cracks, squeeze-ups along these cracks might\nform the narrow crenulate, braided, and en echelon\nridges. That extrusion does occur is exemplified\nwhere ridge material overlaps small craters (ref. 3 1-8),\nas shown in figure 31-25.

Craters on mare ridges (as in\nOceanus Procellarum, northwest of Gruithuisen\nCrater) suggest explosive activity accompanying ridge\ndevelopment (ref. 31-27).\nAccording to Williams (ref. 31-28), the propelling\nforce of domical protrusions on Earth seems to be\nvolatile pressure, accounting for the periodic explosions that accompany extrusion of terrestrial domes\nand spines. As crystallization in a magma chamber\nproceeds, gas pressure increases rapidly, and extrusion\nof viscous domes and plugs commonly marks the\nclose of volcanic activity. Hollow spines and irregular\nprotrusions also occur on basalt flows, presumably as\na result of volatile pressure (ref. 31-29).

The inconsistent\nen echelon patterns of ridges\n(with both dextral and sinistral arrays along the same\nstructural\ntrend) can be attributed\nto extrusion along\ntension fractures\nrather than to large-scale transcurrent faulting.\n2. Circular ridges over buried crater rims can be\nexplained in this context without requiring a postmare period of lava extrusion along crater fractures;\nthe latter mechanism\nseems particularly\nunlikely at\nsmall craters, such as the one in figure 31-15.\n3. The highly contorted,\nbraided, and discontinuous patterns of many ridges seem more likely related\nto shallow structures\nthan to major tectonic control.\n4. The combination\nof broad arches and superposed narrow crenulate ridges seems better explained\nas a result of autointrusion\nand extrusion-with\ncontemporaneous\nnormal faulting in some cases-than\nby compressional\nbuckling\nor thrust faulting,\nalthough both of the latter processes may also occur.\n5. Some of the textures of the Apollo 11 ilmenite\nbasalts were interpreted\nby James and Jackson (ref.\n31-31) as indicative of lava lake conditions, including\nhornfels textures, caused by metamorphism\nof crustal\nfragments depressed into molten lava. Although they\nproposed only local ponding in flooded craters, the\nhypothesis\nsuggested herein may be compatible\nwith\ntheir interpretations.\nThat a lava lake hypothesis\ndoes not explain all\nmare ridges is convincingly\ndemonstrated\nby the\nfollowing examples.\n1. Some ridges are continuous\nacross lavas of\ndifferent\nages, as at the margin of Mare Serenitatis\n(part A of sec. 29).\n2. Several ridges extend into terra, as near the\nApollo 17 landing site (ref. 31-32) and near Fra\nMauro (ref. 31-33).\nAdditional problems include the manner in which\nmare flooding\n\noccurred.\n\nThe prominent\n\nflow scarps in\n\nSTUDIES\n\n31-21\n\nMare Imbrium and the layering in the walls of Rima\nHadley (ref. 31-34) suggest that mare accumulation\nmay have been by superposition\nof many relatively\nthin flows-rather\nthan by massive flooding. However,\nthe Irnbrium flows exhibit the only prominent\nflow\nfronts yet found on the Moon, suggesting that they\nmay be anomalous-a\nlate-stage extrusion\nof a relatively small volume of lava (ref. 31-23), probably\nsomewhat more viscous than that initially predominant in the maria. The apparent\nlayering at Rima\nHadley might have occurred within a single flow unit,\nor alternatively,\nearly flood lavas may have remained\nmolten at depth, despite superposition\nof thin flows\nat the surface.\nThe superposition\nof ridge material\non a few\nadjacent impact craters indicates a hiatus between\ncrust formation\nand ridge extrusion.\nHowever, such\ncraters are consistently\nsmall-on\nthe order of a\nkilometer-and\nthus require a solid crust of only a\nfew hundred meters for their formation.\nTotal thickness of the maria may be as great as several kilometers\n(refs. 31-35 and 31-36) so that the time of complete\ncrystallization\nof successive ponded lavas may have\nbeen very long. Numerous\nsmall flooded craters (on\nthe order of a few kilometers)\nsuggest a depth of\nsurfieial lava of only a few hundred meters; alternatively, these craters could perhaps have formed by\nimpact in a lake crust of appropriate\nthickness for\nflooding without destruction.\nIn conclusion,\nthe suggestion\nthat some mare\nridges formed as squeeze-ups\nand autointrusions\nin\ntension fractures over buried topography\nin the crusts\nof lava lakes merits addition to the list of genetic\nhypotheses\npertaining\nto these most prominent\nand\nperplexing structures of the lunar maria.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSpecial thanks are accorded to Donald A.

They include both mare ridges and\nsimilar-looking one-sided scarps. Evidence will be\npresented here to suggest that these ridges and scarps\nmay be anticlines and thrust faults that resulted from\nsliding on a dkcollement surface. Alternative interpretations are presented by Scott (part D) and\nHodges (part B).\nThe largest of these fresh mare ridges is referred to\nhere as \xe2\x80\x9cLittrow ridge.\xe2\x80\x9d It extends 130 km south\nfrom Le Monnier Crater to near Littrow B Crater.\nFigure 31-33 shows that the north end of Littrow\nridge banks up against the highlands as a sinuous\nscarp resembling a flow front. We suggest that this is a\nconsequence of thrusting the edge of a flat plate of\nrelatively hard basalt against a homogeneous mountain, as indicated in figure 31-34(a). In the mountain,\nthe fault cuts up to the surface through regolith\nrather than continuing as a horizontal plane into the\nmountain block. Littrow ridge is not likely to be a\nflow front, because at its south end it crosses two\nstratigraphic units (fig. 31-35). Evidence is presented\nelsewhere (part A of sec. 29) that the eastern ring\nbasalt, on the left side of figure 31-35, overlaps the\ndark Littrow material on the right. The Littrow ridge\nhas numerous bright blocky areas in the younger\nbasalt, but, southeast of the geologic contact, the\nridge-scarp assumes the very dark, unblocky character\nof the older material. The ridge thus appears to be a\nfault-bounded flexure that deforms both units. The\nground to the left of the ridge appears to be\noverriding eastward along a thrust with small displacement.\nAnother branch of Littrow ridge lies a few\nkilometers to the west of the area in figure 31-35.

In\nthe Apollo 17 valley, the scarp offsets the basalt\nsurface down 80 m to the east and so must be a fault.\nLocally, there are \xe2\x80\x9cbackflow\xe2\x80\x9d features or scarps that\nface the opposite way from the main scarp. These\nmay be antithetic thrusts caused by buckling, as\nsuggested in figure 31-34(d). Probably as a result of\nsimilar antithetic thrusts, parts of the Littrow ridge\nhave both symmetric and asymmetric scarps (fig.\n3 1-37), and the direction of asymmetry changes along\nstrike. This deformation is possibly analogous to\nobduction and subduction in terrestrial plate tec-\n\nFIGURE 31-37.-Symmetrical portion of Littrow ridge, with\nfissures along the crest (15 km northwest of area shown in\nfig. 31-35). Area shown is 5 km across. The fissures are\nbelieved to be a consequence of stretching over the\nanticline, as in pressure ridges of terrestrial lavas.\n\ntonics, where one plate rides over in some areas and\nthe other plate rides over in other areas. This\nrelationship suggests a mobile substratum or ddcollement.\nThe supposed upper thrust plates described here\nare generally buckled into anticlinal ridges. Similar\nbuckle folds occupy the upper plates of some\nuneroded thrust faults that reach the ground surface\non Earth (refs. 31-19 and 31-37; figs. 31-18 and\n31-19). Rarely, the lunar anticlines are fissured along\ntheir crests by stretching (fig. 3 1-37).\nLittrow ridge appears to be much younger than\nthe lavas that it deforms. This conclusion is based on\nthe observation that craters of presumed impact\norigin are deformed by the ridge (figs. 31-33 and\n31-36), and the same relationship applies at Lara\n\nMARE RIDGES AND RELATED\nCrater on the Lee-Lincoln\nScarp (sec. 6 of this\nreport).\nThe deformed\ncraters in figures 31-33 and\n31-36 are 1300 and 650 m across, respectively.\nThe\ncratering\nflux in mare-age\ntime (refs. 31-38 and\n31-39) would require several tens of millions of years\nfor random impacts to make these craters in an area\nthe size of Littrow ridge. A similar ridge deforms the\neven larger (3 kin) crater Littrow BB.

Scott a\n\nApollo\n17 premission\ngeologic studies of the\nTaurus-Littrow\nregion of the Moon revealed numerous small structures,\nin both mare and terra, having\nsomewhat\nsimilar morphologies\nand variously resembling fault scarps, flow fronts, and mare ridges. Many\nof these features are too small to be identified\non\nLunar Orbiter IV photographs,\nwhich provided the\nmost comprehensive,\nhigh-resolution\ncoverage of this\narea before the later Apollo missions. The panoramicand metric-camera\nphotographs\nof Apollo 17 were\ntaken at lower Sun angles than those of Apollo 15,\nwhich were used for the geologic mapping\n(refs.\n31-40 and 31-41), and thus more clearly reveal fine\ndetails of texture and relief. In the illustrations\nof this\npart, several of these small structures are compared. It\nis concluded\nthat they probably\ndeveloped\nas lava\nextrusions\nfrom fractures and fissures; they cannot be\neasily explained by faulting.\nFigure 31-38 shows the prominent\nridge and scarp\n(generally referred to as the Lee-Lincoln Scarp) that\nextends across the Littrow valley between the North\nand South Massifs. This is the largest example of a\ncomposite\nstructure\nthat is morphologically\nvariable\nalong its length and may reflect various modes of\norigin from place to place. It was traversed by the\nApollo 17 crew near its southern extremity\n(outside\nthe photograph)\nwhere the scarp is less continuous\nand several breaks\noccur in the wall. Along the\n\nau.s. Geological Survey.\n\nsouthern and central parts of the structure\n(areas A\nand B), mare-type\nridges and overlapping\nlobes\nsuggest emplacement\nas lava flows from the west. To\nthe north, where it crosses the steep face of North\nMassif (area C), it has the form of a ledge-like scarp or\nterrace, believed by some geologists to be indicative\nof normal- or high-angle reverse faulting (ref. 31-41\nand part C of this section). The material forming the\nledge, however, appears smoother and more youthful\nthan that of the massif (ref. 31-42) and may consist\nof lava extruded\nalong a fissure. In many respects,\nthis structure resembles the mare ridge/highland\nledge\n(which is not readily interpreted\nas a faulted structure) along the southwestern\nrim of the crater Le\nMonnier shown in Apollo 15 panoramic camera frame\nAS15-9303 (fig. 31-33).\nThe northern\nen echelon\n\nextension\n\nof the\n\nLee-\n\nLincoln Scarp is shown in figure 31-39 with probable\nflow fronts visible in places (areas A and B) but\nhaving a sinuous to somewhat\ncuspate appearance\n(area C) more like the structures in the hilly material\nof figure 31-40, located about 50 km to the south. In\nfigure 31-40, two opposing scarplets (areas A and B)\nresemble slabs of rock separated\nalong sheet-joints\nparallel or subparaUel\nto the surface.\nThese are\nformed on Earth by a complex of processes including\npressure release and strong diumal thermal variations.\nThere are no obvious remnants\nof the intervening\nportions\nof the slab, however,\nand one of the\nstructures appears to be intergradational\n(at area C)\nwith a mare ridge.\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n3 1-26\n\n-\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\nkm\n\nFIGURE 31-38.-Composite structure (Lee-Lincoln Scarp)\nextending across the valley floor and North Massif near\nApollo 17 landing site: (A) and (B) mare-type ridges and\nlobate, overlapping flow fronts; (C) ledge along North\nMassif (Apollo 17 panoramic camera frame AS17-2314).\n\nFigures 31-41 and 31-42 show two ledges along\nthe face of a massif just north of the crater Vitruvius.\nIn places, they have the appearance of \xe2\x80\x9cstrand lines\xe2\x80\x9d\n(refs. 3 1-43 and 3 1-44) that are common around mare\nembayments in this area (Apollo 17 panoramic\ncamera frame AS17-2297) and presumably mark the\nhighest occurrence of basalt fill.

The large\nrille (A), Rima Littrow 111, is nearly buried by\noverlapping apparent lava flows (areas B and C) that\nbecome younger and more ridge-like (D) to the south.\nRelationships are not simple, however, as the direction of flow seems to be upslope toward the\nnortheast. This may be due to subsequent downwarping of the Serenitatis basin to the west, but the\nposition of the flow with respect to the highland\nbarrier (E) in the northwest part of the photograph is\ndifficult to reconcile in this case.

In the pre-Apollo era, hypotheses for the genesis\nof lunar craters usually were constructed\nwithout any\nnumerical\ndescriptive\ndata. Such speculations\nwill\nhave little credibility\nunless supported\nby accurate,\nquantitative\ndata, especially\nthose generated\nfrom\nApollo orbital photographs.\nThis paper presents a\ngeneral study of the surface geometry of 25 far-side\ncraters and a more\ndetailed\nstudy of rim-crest\nevenness for 15 near-side and far-side craters.

The 29 craters profded and measured\nin that study range in diameter from 16 to 100 km\nand vary in relative age. From a brief analysis of\nsurface geometry,\nMironova concluded\nthat the farside craters were similar in shape to near-side craters\nand were volcanic. Both interpretations\nare examined\nwith reference to new data on far-side craters as well\nas to prior results in near-side crater morphometry.\nAccording to previous work (ref. 32-2), most lunar\nnear-side craters are geometrically\nsimilar to terrestrial meteorite-impact\ncraters and do not resemble\nvolcanic craters except for some maars and tuff rings.\nThe morphometric\ncriteria that reveal this distinction\nbest are three ratios of crater dimensions\n(fig. 32-1):\nrim height/diameter,\nrim height/crater\ndepth,\nand\nouter-rim\nwidth/diameter.\nAlthough,\nstatistically,\nrim-crest circularity\nalso is a good genetic discriminant, it can break down when applied to anomalous\nindividual craters, which include highly circular maars\nand calderas as well as polygonal\nand asymmetric\nimpact craters. Additional criteria, for making shape\ncomparisons\namong\nlunar craters\nalone, are the\ndepth/diameter\nratio and the slope of crater rims.\nThe dimensions\nof 25 different\nfar-side craters\nwere\ncrest\n\nobtained\noutlines\n\nfrom topographic\nprofiles and rimreduced\nphotogrammetrically\nfrom\n\nApollo 15 metric camera photographs\n(table 32-I and\nfig. 32-2). Two profiles, intersecting\nat 90 \xc2\xb0 at the\ncrater center, were made across the 15 largest craters\nfrom stereographic\nmodels leveled primarily on the\nfiat inner floors. Thus, the smaller craters that are\nsituated along these profiles probably are leveled with\nthe same degree of accuracy. The sample craters vary\nin appearance from fresh to subdued; despite efforts\nto represent correctly\nall degrees of relative age, the\nresulting sample is weighted toward fresher craters.\nThe six dimensions\nrecorded\nfor each crater (fig.\n32-1) are averaged values of rim diameter, width of\nthe inner- and outer-rim flanks, diameter of the inner\nfiat floor, depth, and height of the rim crest above\nthe exterior datum. Other values in table 32-I were\ncalculated\nfrom\nthese data. A simple\nrim-crest circularity was also computed.\n\nindex\n\nof\n\nApollo depth/diameter\nresults from far-side craters\nfit near-side depth/diameter\nrelations, obtained from\n\nRim \' Outer- l_Inner- .Floor\nl .\n....\n,j rim _ rtm _dameter\nnetgm ,-width-_,_wth_t\nd "i - .W\n"._L .....\n,\n__\n,.uepm\n_---,\n-i- ;-.-_ ....\nl\n0\n\ni\n\nt\n\nI\n\nE\n.\n............\n-\n\nJ\n20\n\nkm\nFIGURE 32-1.-Six crater dimensions.

Directions\nare approximate only.\n\n800 craters (ref. 32-2), more accurately\nthan do the\nZond 3 data, which generally\nrepresent\ncraters as\nbeing excessively\nshallow (fig. 32-3). Despite the\nscarcity of fresh craters in the 10- to 20-km-diameter\nrange spanning the inflection\nin the depth/diameter\nplot, the Apollo results agree well with the near-side\nmeasurements.\nThere is some suggestion\nthat the\nApollo data show craters as slightly deeper than do\nolder shadow-length\nmeasurements.\nAdditional\nphotogrammetric\ndata\n(near-side\nmeasurements,\nnot\nshown here) support both findings for far-side craters.\nUsing the depth/diameter\nproportion,\nMironova\n(ref. 32-3) deduced\na volcanic\ngenesis for both\nnear-side and far-side craters from the same type of\nanalog argument\nby which Baldwin (ref. 32-5) inferred the impact origin of near-side craters. Although\nthe depth/diameter\nrelation\nhas become the most\noften used morphometric\ncriterion of crater genesis,\nthe generous\noverlap\namong depth/diameter\nfields\ndescribing\nall types of lunar and terrestrial\ncraters\ndemonstrates\nthat it is also the least reliable of all\navailable geometric discriminants\n(ref. 32-2). Accordingly, neither set of far-side depth/diameter\ndata can\nsupport any specific genetic hypothesis.\nCrater depth\nmeasurements\nare better applied to the analysis of\nrelative age (ref. 32-5). 1\nBoth Apollo and Zond 3 rim height measurements\nare consistent with an impact origin for large far-side\ncraters\npoints,\n\n(fig. 32-4). Despite errors and the paucity of\nboth sets of results are at least roughly similar\n\nPike, R.

The difference in circularity for craters\nabove and below the 17-km-diameter\nlocation of the\ninflection\nin the depth/diameter\ncurve, only 0.02, is\nnot significant.\nThese values are more consistent with\nan impact genesis of the 25 sample craters than with a\nvolcanic origin, which typically\nresults in a much\nlower degree of planimetric\nradial symmetry\n(ref.\n32-9).\nThe relative steepness of crater rims, a dimension\nwhich can be measured\nreliably from the Apollo\nphotographs,\nvaries fairly systematically\nwith crater\ndiameter\nand relative age. The angles of inner- and\nouter-rim\nslope used here are highly generalized\nvalues. Respectively,\nthey are average slope between\nthe rim crest and the juncture of the inner-rim slope\nand the fiat floor, and average slope between the rim\ncrest and the break in slope at the base of the\nouter-rim flank. The average rim slopes differ substantially from the maximum\nrim slopes, which were\ncalculated\nover much shorter distances and used in\nthe analysis of Zond 3 imagery; a direct comparison is\nnot meaningful.\nThe slope values used here are\npreferable\nbecause they are more representative\nand\nless subject to chance errors in raw data.\nA graph of inner-rim slope angle as a function of\ncrater diameter reveals a new size-dependent\nmorphometric\ndiscontinuity\nat the 10- tc 20-km-diameter\nrange (fig. 32-5). The break in the distribution,\nwhich\nis duplicated\nin a comparable\ngraph for 14 near-side\ncraters (not shown), probably\nis real.

The inflection\nalmost certainly\nresults from\nthe appearance of a well-defined, fiat interior floor in\nyoung craters approximately\n10 to 20 km in diameter\n(table 32-1). The increasing\nsteepness within craters\njust above the critical\ndifferences\nin interior\nfloorless and flat-floored\n\nsize threshold\narises from\nprorde\ngeometry\nbetween\ncraters. In a floorless crater,\n\nthe interior rim slope is measured between the center\nof the crater bottom\nand the rim crest; the slope\nlength includes a considerable\nproportion\nof gentle\nterrain near the lowest part of the crater. In a crater\nwith a flat floor, inner-rim\nslope is measured only\nbetween the rim crest and the edge of the floor; the\ngentler terrain between the floor edge and the crater\ncenter is omitted,\nand the resulting\nslope value is\nhigher. Formation of fiat floors within lunar craters is\na difficult\nproblem\nwith no unique solution.\nThe\nfloor phenomenon\nappears to be both size and age\nrelated, as is the appearance\nof terraced\nrims and\ncentral peaks. The various hypotheses\noffered to\nexplain the 10- to 20-km-diameter\ndiscontinuity\nhave\nbeen discussed at length elsewhere (refs. 32-10 and\n32-11).\nAside from the discontinuity\nat 10 to 20 km\ndiameter and in view of the vagaries of lunar surface\nevents affecting\nrim shape, the negative\nrelation\nbetween\nrim slope and crater size is remarkably\nsystematic.\nThis relation,\ntogether with other geometric relations discussed in this subsection,\nsuggests\n\n32-6\n\nAPOLLO\n17PRELIMINARY\nSCIENCE\n\nthat lunar craters inherently\nshapes. Such regularity of\ngenesis by a single major\nuncommonly\nbroad size\n\nhave highly predictable\nform is consistent\nwith\nprocess operating\nover an\nrange. Whereas impact is\n\nsuch a process, volcanic eruption produces landforms\nthat vary much more in shape than do the far-side\ncraters described here and the near-side craters with\nwhich they compare so closely.\nDetailed morphometric\nexamination\nof 25 lunar\nfar-side craters from exceptionally\nhigh-quality\ndata\nsuggests that (1) differences\nbetween near-side and\nfar-side craters are negligible and that (2) the far-side\ncraters more probably formed by the impact of large\ncosmic bodies rather than by volcanism.\nMironova\n(ref. 32-3) also reached the first conclusion\nbut, as\nrevealed by the results presented\nhere, not for the\nsame\nreasons.\nEvidently,\nthe\nphotoclinometric\nmethod, the only way to obtain quantitative\ndata\nfrom the Zond 3 imagery, did not yield morphometric information\nas accurate as that of even the\nolder\nnora\'s\n\nshadow-length\ncrater\nconclusion that lunar\n\nmeasurements.\nfar-side craters\n\nfrom volcanic eruptions\nis not supported\nstudy.\nRather,\nthe results\nobtained\nfrom\nmetric cameras, and indeed most of the\nmeasurements,\nare more consistent\nwith an\ngenesis for the lunar far-side and near-side\n\nRIM-CREST\n\nMiroformed\nby this\nApollo\nZond 3\nimpact\n\ncraters.\n\nEVENNESS\n\nHigh-quality\ntopographic\ndata from Apollo 15 to\n17 photographs make it possible to examine quantitatively a hitherto\nunstudied\naspect of lunar crater\nshape: configuration\nof the rim-crest profile. Millman\n(ref. 32-12) made a detailed numerical analysis of the\nrim of the New Quebec Crater, a terrestrial meteorite\ncrater, but all prior evaluations\nof crater rim-crest\nshape on the Moon have been qualitative.\nAlthough\ndata are not yet available for a thorough investigation\nof rim-crest shape with respect to every aspect, such\nas relative crater age or location\n(mare versus terra,\nfar side versus near side), two variations\ncan be\ntreated\nin this initial study: (1) that of tim-crest\nheight with azimuth of rim-crest\nsegments and (2)\nthat of rim-crest relief with crater size.\nThe first problem arose from certain pre-Apollo\nlunar contour maps that portray many craters with a\nsystematic\nsymmetry\nin the altitude\nof their rim\ncrests. On both the 1:5 000000\nU.S. Army Map\nService Topographic\nLunar Map and the various\n1:1 000000\nU.S. Air Force\nLunar Aeronautical\n\nREPORT\n\nCharts, the rim crests of larger craters generally are\nmuch higher along the eastern and western parts of\nthe walls than along the northern\nand southern rim\nsegments.\nSuch a systematic\nrim height relation,\nwhich is not evident upon photointerpretation\nor\nvisual observation\nof the lunar surface, would have\nstructural\nsurement\n\nimplications\nand would complicate\nmeaof crater average depths and rim heights.\n\nThe second\nproblem\nstems from the common\ntelescopic observation\nthat rim crests of lunar craters\nbelow a certain\ndiameter\nappear\nrelatively\neven,\nwhereas rim crests of larger craters are significantly\nless even. The critical diameter has been suggested as\n16 km (ref. 32-13) and as 50 to 60 km (ref. 32-14).\nThis observation,\nwhich corresponds\nto previously\ndiscussed\nsize-dependent\ndifferences\namong lunar\ncraters, may to some extent have arisen because of\nthe reduced detail visible in small craters at the limit\nof Earth-based telescopic resolution.\nTo examine both variations,\ncircular\n\ntopographic\n\npro\xc2\xa3des of crater rim crests were obtained\nfrom\nphotogrammetry\nof Apollo 15 and 17 metric camera\nphotographs.\nThe 15 sample craters selected for this\nstudy range in diameter\nfrom 2.5 to 190 km and\ninclude\nfar-side and near-side craters,\nupland and\npostmare\ncraters, and both old and young craters.\nBetween 20 and 36 elevations (average, 28)located\nalong the crater rim crests were determined\nin each\nstereographic\nmodel. After the north direction\n(0 \xc2\xb0)\nhad been ascertained\nfor all craters, the location of\neach sample elevation on the rim crest was read to the\nnearest 10 \xc2\xb0 azimuth. Seven quantities were calculated\nfor each crater from the resulting elevations (table\n32-11): (1) total relief (maximum difference in elevation) along the rim crest, (2) the ratio of tim-crest\nrelief to crater diameter,\n(3) mean elevation of the\nrim crest (arbitrary datum), and (4) to (7) deviation\nfrom mean elevation of the heights of the northern,\nsouthern,\neastern, and western walls, expressed as a\nplus or minus percentage of total rim-crest relief. The\ndeviations were averaged from the three (occasionally\nfewer) elevations\nclosest to the four cardinal directions.\nThe solution to the first problem appears unambiguous; no systematic\nrelation exists among the sample\nrim-crest data. When averaged for all 15 craters in\ntable 32-II, the four deviations from mean rim-crest\nelevation are -0.02 (north), 0.08 (east), 0.00 (south),\nand -0.07 (west), respectively.\nThe tendency toward\nslightly higher eastern walls and lower western walls\nmay reflect difficulties\nin obtaining\nprecise photo-\n\nCRATER\n\nTABLE\n\nCrater name\nor

PRELIMINARY\n\nSCIENCE\n\nPART\nAITKEN\n\nCRATER\n\nREPORT\n\nB\n\nAND\n\nITS ENVIRONS\n\nFarouk El-Baz a\n\nThe crater Aitken is among the most significant\nfeatures photographed\nduring the Apollo 17 mission.\nThis was the first Apollo mission to fly over Aitken,\nlocated at latitude 17 \xc2\xb0 S, longitude 173 \xc2\xb0 E, in as yet\nundivided highlands. The crater is approximately\n150\nkm in diameter and, based on shadow measurements,\napproximately 5 km deep.\nAitken is one of few fresh-looking and therefore\nrelatively young craters on the lunar far side; its rim\ndeposits are clearly superposed\non older, unnamed\nfeatures. The crater is characterized by (1) a slightly\nhigh albedo, continuous\nejecta blanket that extends\noutward to approximately\none crater diameter; (2)\nflow patterns and dunes extending\nbeyond\nthe\ncontinuous\nejecta\nblanket to approximately\ntwo\ncrater diameters; (3) sharp secondary-crater\nchains\nthat also extend outward to two crater diameters; (4)\nirregularly terraced\ncrater walls\nsurfaces; (5) dark mare-like f\'dl\nored swirls; and (6) a cluster\ndiameter with interior domical\nlava marks" on their walls.\nBefore the Apollo\n\nhaving very few flat\nwith some light-colof craters 6 km in\nstructures and "high\n\n17 mission,\n\nAitken Crater was\n\nphotographed\nby the Lunar Orbiter II and Zond 8\nspacecraft.\nHowever, the Apollo 17 coverage added\nnumerous details, as summarized\nin the following\ndescription of\nits features.\n\nthe general setting\n\nCRATER\n\nof the crater and\n\nSURROUNDINGS\n\nAitken Crater is in a rugged and densely pitted\narea of the lunar far-side highlands.\nAs shown in\nfigure 32-6, the continuous\nejecta blanket\nthat\nextends\n100 to 150 km from the rim crest is\nsomewhat\nbrighter\nzone, thick debris\n\nthan the surroundings.\nIn this\nmantles and subdues preexisting\n\ntopography.\n\naNational Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution.\n\nChains\n\nand\n\nclusters\n\nof\n\ncraters\n\nthat\n\nare\n\nmost\n\nprobably\nsecondary\nto Aitken Crater are best portrayed in the low-Sun-angle\nphotography\nof Zond 8;\none crater chain measures approximately\n300 km in\nlength (fig. 32-7). Numerous craters in the vicinity of\nAitken are filled with light plains materials. Some of\nthese craters are younger than Aitken, indicating that\nthe plains materials are not Aitken ejecta but may be\nlocally derived. Intercrater\nlight plains in the same\nregion, however,\nare more densely pitted and are\noverlain by craters secondary\nto Aitken and by fine\nejecta. These observations\nsuggest multiple sources\nfor the light plains units in the lunar highlands.\nFlow scarps probably related to the deposition of\nthe ejecta blanket of Aitken Crater occur beyond the\ncontinuous\nrim deposits. These small-scale structures\nare best studied in high-resolution\nApollo 17 panoramic camera photographs.\nTwo examples\nin the\nregion north-northeast\nof the crater are shown in\nfigure 32-8.\nScarps in both areas display lobate fronts and\nappear to cross the terrain with complete disregard of\npreexisting topography.\nThe scarps are reminiscent of\nthe flow scarps in the area of the crater Mandel\'shtam\n(ref. 32-15). Similar but not identical scarps were also\nobserved around King Crater (refs. 32-16 and 32-17),\nwhere they show definite relationships\nto the preexisting terrain-accelerating\ndownslope\nand decelerating upslope (ref. 32-16). No such relationship\nis\nclear in the case of the flow scarps near Aitken\nCrater.\nCRATER\n\nINTERIOR\n\nAlthough\ngenerally\ncircular,\nthe rim crest of\nAitken Crater is crenulate\nand marked by a few\nstraight segments. There is an affinity toward northeast-southwest\nand northwest-southeast\nlinear trends.\nThe wall of Aitken Crater is irregular. There is one\nsteep scarp in the northeastern\npart and only one\ndiscontinuous\nterrace that extends to approximately\none-fifth of the crater depth, and the rest of the wall\nis made up of domical and irregular blocks (fig. 32-9).\n\nCRATER STUDIES\n\n32-9\n\nFIGURE 32-6.-Part of Lunar Orbiter I1 frame 33-M centered on the crater Aitken Oat. 17" S, long.\n173" E). Relative high albedo rim deposits of Aitken extend outward to one crater diameter.\nIcarus Crater with its large central peak is in the upper right corner; west of it is Daedalus Crater.\nNorthwest of Aitken is the pair of old subdued craters, Heaviside (right) and Keeler (left). Due\nsouth of Aitken Crater is the crater Van de Graaff, on the northeastern rim of Mare Ingenii.\n\nBy comparison with other large craters (e.g., Copernicus), only very few flat areas (the so-called "pools")\nare observed on the wall terraces.\nThe jumbled appearance of the crater wall may be\nascribed to post-Aitken events, particularly those\nevents that formed the 30-km-diameter crater on the\nnorthern wall and the 12-km-diameter crater on the\nnorthern rim of Aitken Crater (fig. 32-9). These\nprobable impact craters may have caused massive\nslumping and downslope movement along the wall of\nAitken. The effects of this slumping are obvious in\n(1) widening of the crater in places and the crenula-\n\ntions along the eastern and western parts of the wall;\n(2) the presence of a large and relatively flat unit that\nis interpreted as a landslide next to the steep scarp on\nthe northeastern part of the wall; (3) the apparent\nlack of flat pools and sharp terraces, in spite of the\nrelative freshness of other features of the crater; and\n(4) complete destruction of the northern part of the\nwall by the superposition of the unnamed 30-kmdiameter crater.\nThe floor of Aitken Crater displays several unique\nfeatures. It is filled with dark mare-like material,\nwhich, in the southwestern quadrant, is marked by\n\n32-10\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nFIGURE 32-7.-Zond 8 photograph of Aitken Crater (150\nkm in diameter) and its surroundings. A major chain of\nsecondary craters extends toward the north. Smaller\nchains are in the north-northwest sector. Secondarycrater\nclusters randomly surround the crater. Light plains\nmaterial fills the floors of smaller surrounding craters in\ncontrast to the darker mare-like fill in the floor of Aitken.\nNote the sharpness of the crater rim crest. Area of figure\n32-8(a) is indicated by \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9d; area of figure 32-8(b) is\nindicated by \xe2\x80\x9c2\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nlight-colored swirls (fig. 32-10). These swirls are at\nthe northern edge of the Ingenii belt of light-colored\nmarkings (ref. 32-18).\nThe central peak of the crater consists of two\nsegments. The larger and topographically higher\nsegment to the east trends generally north-south, and\nthe smaller and topographically lower portion is\nrepresented by a row of discontinuous hills (fig.\n32-9). This arrangement of the central peak complex\nsuggests an incipient ring. Smaller probable impact\ncraters such as Tycho and Aristarchus display a\nclustered central feature; larger craters such as Schrodinger display a complete ring structure. Aitken\nCrater appears to display characteristics that lie\nbetween these two types.\nNumerous flow scarps are clearly visible in the\ndark mare floor, particularly in the eastern and\n\nFIGURE 32-8.-Flow scarps and other flow structures northnortheast of the crater Aitken as seen in Apollo 17\npanoramic camera photographs.

These craters range in size\nfrom 4 to 7 km. The interiors of three in one cluster\nare occupied by equal-size, perfectly domical structures (fig. 32-12). The domical structures are very\nunusual in appearance and somewhat resemble those\nreported in the Mons Rumker area (ref. 32-19). The\nthree craters in the eastern part of the floor, as well as\nan isolated one in the southwestern floor of Aitken,\nare breached; the breaches lead t o flow scarps in the\nfloor fill, suggesting that the craters are related to the\nfill. They may have been the source of the mare\n\nCRATER STUDIES\n\n32-1 1\n\nmaterial, or at least part of it. The domical structures\nin their interiors may represent the last stages of\nvolcanic eruption. These structures were described by\nthe Apollo 17 command module pilot as resembling\nthe dacite domes in northern California and Oregon\n(sec. 28).

The freshness and lesser degradation of the rm\ni\ncrest may have been caused by post-Aitken events.\nThe dark floor fil, its flow scarps, and smaller\ncraters with domical structures are probably volcanic\nin origin. The variety of landforms suggests episodic\neruptions represented by the dark basalt-like floor\nmaterial and finally the more viscous domical materials in the smaller craters.\nThis combination of impact and volcanic structures makes Aitken Crater particularly attractive for\nfuture study and analysis. In addition to the fact that\nit is one of very few craters on the lunar far side with\na dark mare floor, the crater is young enough for its\nfeatures to be well preserved. Extensive photographic\ncoverage of Aitken Crater by the Apollo 17 crewmen\nwill permit detailed investigation of its many interesting features.\n\nCRATER\n\nSTUDIES\n\nPART\nVOLCANIC\n\nFEATURES\n\nC\n\nOF FAR-SIDE\n\nW.

In many respects, it resembles\nthe well-known\ncrater Tsiolkovsky,\nwhich is at the\nsame latitude\nbut approximately\n40 \xc2\xb0 to the west.\nHowever, the outer walls and surrounding\nslopes of\nAitken\nCrater\ndo not show the extensive\nejecta\nblanket or the prominent\nlandslide deposits so evident at Tsiolkovsky Crater.\nPost-impact\nvolcanism\nat Aitken\nCrater is suggested by several features\n(fig. 32-14), the most\nobvious being the mare-type\nfilling that floors the\ncrater and virtually makes an island of the central\npeak. Light-colored\nswirls on the surface of this riffling\nresemble those in Mare Marginis: they do not appear\nto have any appreciable\nrelief. The swirls may\nrepresent\nfumarolic\nalteration\nof the lava, or dust\ndeposits from postfill landslides on the crater walls.\nThe dark floor filling also shows several elongated pits\nand irregular rille-like features that also are characteristic of mare fill and that may represent\nvents or\ncollapsed lava tubes.\nAitken Crater shows several unusual features that\nmay represent\nvolcanic events extending beyond the\nperiod of mare-type\ncrater flooding. Among these are\nthe circular, maar-like depressions that appear in the\nsouthern and northwestern\nparts of the crater. These\nmight represent\nvolcanic\ncraters\nflooded\nby lava\nfollowing a period of explosive eruptions; or, alternatively, they may be impact craters produced in thin\ncrust of the ponded mare-type fill before this rifflwas\n\nawoods Hole Oceanographic Institution.\n\n32-13\n\nCRATER\n\nAITKEN\n\nAdams a\n\ncompletely\ncrystallized.\nOn the eastern side of the\nmain crater floor, several more circular craters enclose\npeculiar clusters of dome-like features\nextrusions of more viscous lava.\nA small crater approximately\nAitken Crater also shows what\n\nthat\n\nmight\n\nbe\n\n100 km west of\nmay be a riffling of\n\nrelatively viscous lava (fig. 32-15). It is difficult\nto\ninterpret this crater Idling as slump from walls of a\ncrater produced by impact because the walls are only\na little higher in elevation than the surface of the\nriffling and because the central riffling does not slope\nfrom the walls toward\nthe center of the crater.\nRather, the central riffling has an almost horizontal\n(although\nrough) surface, and its contact with the\ncrater walls closely follows a low, moat-like depression. The alinement of two large pits or craters ("B"\nin fig. 32-15) along the peripheral depression suggests\nthat they originated\ninternally;\nthey may be explosion craters. The conspicuous\nfractures on the upper\nsurface of the dome may have been produced\nby\nendogenous growth. By analogy with terrestrial volcanic domes, cooling might be expected to produce\nthe hexagonal\nshrinkage cracks typical of columnar\njointing. However, this fracturing probably would be\nmuch smaller in scale than that observed\nin this\ncrater.\nThe volcanic fillings in Aitken Crater and in the\nsmaller crater to the west are relatively youthful in\nappearance\ncompared to the generally old highlandtype topography\nsurrounding\nthem. Our initial impression, which should be checked by more detailed\nwork, is that the volcanic activity is considerably\nyounger than the impact events that produced\nthe\nhost craters and is probably contemporary\nwith mare\nvolcanism on the lunar near side.\n\n32-1 4\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\ni\n\n20\n\n0\n\nkm\n\nFIGURE 32-14.-The crater Aitken, showing elongated pits and rille-like features in mare-type filling\n(A), maar-like depressions (B), and depressions with clusters of possible lava domes (C) (Apollo 17\nmetric camera frame AS17-0481).\n\nCRATER STUDIES\n\n32-15\n\n20\n\n0\nkm\n\nFIGURE 32-15.-Possible volcanic extrusion in small crater\nwest of Aitken Crater.

Oberbecka and Robert H. Momsona\n\nThe lunar herringbone pattern was first noted on\nLunar Orbiter and Apollo 8 photographs of Copernicus secondary craters as a series of lineations\nforming V-shaped patterns that, when combined, give\nthe appearance of a herringbone pattern (ref. 32-22).\nLater, a study of this pattern showed conclusively\nthat its components are V-shaped ridges that typically\nare associated with secondary craters (ref. 32-23).\nFigure 32-16 shows the location of four secondarycrater chains, each of which is shown in greater detail\nin figure 32-17.\nArrows superimposed on each photograph (fig.\n32-17) point toward Copernicus Crater. Figure\n32-17(a) includes part of the crater chain originally\nused in reference 32-22 to illustrate the herringbone\n\naNASA Ames Research Center.\n\npattern. The overall appearance is that of intersecting\nlineations projecting from either side of the craterchain axis of symmetry t o form nested V\xe2\x80\x99s. At least\ntwo well-developed series of V-shaped ridges are\nvisible on this crater chain. Figures 32-17(b) and\n32-17(c) show two crater pairs with subdued ridges,\nwhereas figure 32-17(d) shows groups of secondary\ncraters exhibiting well-defined V-shaped ridges. Each\nV-shaped ridge opens in a direction away from\nCopernicus Crater, and each gives the appearance of\nthe head of an arrow pointing in the general direction\nof Copernicus, especially when the crater-chain axis\nof symmetry is along a line radial to Copernicus.\nRecently, a subdued herringbone pattern near the\ncrater Theophilus was observed on Apollo 16 photographs, and its components were simulated experimentally by simultaneous impact of two projectiles\nnear one another on a sand target (ref. 32-24).

Also presented are\n\n32-1 8\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nobservations of isolated crater chains having herringbone patterns, but not obviously associated with any\nprimary craters.

The three craters are seen to be part of the\nprominent chain of craters of figure 32-18 that\ncontinues in a northwest direction across the lunar\nsurface area shown in figure 32-19. The three craters\nare shown once again in much greater detail in an\nApollo 17 panoramic camera photograph (fig. 32-20).\nThe V-shaped ridges associated with these three\ncraters are even more well defined than those\nassociated with the secondaries south of this area.\nThe well-developed ridges emanate from points between the craters.\nTwo other insets of figure 32-19 are magnified\nviews of a crater doublet and a crater chain. The\ncrater doublet of inset (b) also probably is made up\nof secondary craters of Copernicus because of its\nproximity t o the major secondarycrater string pointing to Copernicus. The V-shaped ridges radiate from\npoints between the craters and in front of them. The\n\ncrater chain shown in inset (a) has a very-well-developed V-shaped ridge radiating from a point between\nthe largest crater and the other smaller craters, and\nthere are also several other more subdued V\xe2\x80\x99s. All\npoint to the west, however. These craters may be\nsecondaries of Euler, because they point in its general\ndirection; but they are most probably derived from a\nlarger crater to the west, because they are very much\nlarger than other secondary craters seen in the Euler\nejecta blanket. A possible candidate source crater for\nthis crater chain is Aristarchus because the axis of\nsymmetry of the crater chain is on a line radial to\nAristarchus; in addition, secondaries near Aristarchus\nhave well-developed V-shaped ridges. For example,\nfigure 32-21 is an Apollo 17 metric camera photograph of a very long southeast-striking chain of\nsecondary craters in the area southeast of Aristarchus.\nThe chain can be traced to a point near Aristarchus\nand is on a radial line from Aristarchus. The inset at\nthe bottom of figure 32-21 is a magnification of a\nsmall part of this chain. Most herringbone pattern\ncomponents in this section of the chain are found to\nbe associated with singular, nearly circular craters.\nHowever, there are at least two examples of V-shaped\nridges radiating from points between adjacent secondary craters. In all cases, the V\xe2\x80\x99s point toward\nAristarchus Crater.\n\nSIMULATION OF HERRINGBONE\nPATTERN COMPONENTS\n\nFIGURE 32-20.-Portion of Apollo 17 panoramic camera\nframe AS17-3094 showing chain of three secondary craters (inset (c), fig. 32-19).\n\nThe preceding association of the herringbone\npattern with lunar secondary craters is characteristic\nof the pattern. This association suggests that the\norigin of the herringbone pattern is related to the\norigin of the secondary craters and that the exact\nmechanism of formation of the herringbone pattern\nmay be revealed by a study of the formation of\nsecondary craters. The most common hypothesis for\nformation of secondary craters is production by\nimpact of material ejected from a primary crater. If\nthese craters were produced in this way, it is\nreasonable to assume that adjacent craters would have\nbeen formed at the same time or nearly the same\ntime. Herringbone pattern components might then be\nformed as a result of simultaneous formation of\ncraters near one another. Preliminary results of\nsimultaneous impact were presented in reference\n32-24. More definitive results now are available and\nare presented along with the description of the\n\nCRATER STUDIES\n\n32-21\n\nFIGURE 32-21.-Area southeast of Aristarchus Crater showing a crater chain and detail (inset)\n(Apollo 17 metric camera frame AS17-2930).\n\nmechanism involved in the production of the herringbone pattern.\nMost lunar secondary craters with an associated\nherringbone pattern that can be related to a large\nprimary crater occur within annular areas around the\ncrater from 100 to 400 km wide. Thus, to simulate\nthe typical pair of adjacent lunar secondary craters,\n\nthe conditions of ejection velocity and angle required\nto project fragments to distances in the previously\nmentioned range are determined, and two projectiles\nare launched simultaneously at these conditions into\na sand target. The resulting crater pairs then are\ncompared to lunar craters.\nThe following equation was used to calculate the\n\n32-22\n\nAPOLLO\n17\n\nangular range\nsurface.\n\nn\n\n--\n\n2\n\nr/ of fragments\n\nejected\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nREPORT\n\nfrom the lunar\n3"0\n1\n\narctanr\n\nV2sin\n\ne\n\ncos\n\nO]\n\n(32-I)\n\n]\nwhere\n\nSCIENCE\n\n0 is the\n\nejection\n\nangle measured\n\n2"sr/R?n _, km\n\nI\n\nRange V\nof\n\n/_-,m\n2.0_... 300\n\nfrom\n\nnormal to the surface, gm is the lunar acceleration\ngravity, R m is the radius of the Moon, and V is\nejection velocity.\nThis equation\nwas obtained\nmodifying equation\n(1) given in reference 32-25\naccount for the fact that 0 is measured\nfrom\nsurface normal instead of the horizontal.\nWhen\n\nthe\nof\nthe\nby\nto\nthe\nthe\n\nangular range r/ is converted\nto kilometers\non the\nlunar surface and set equal to constant values ranging\nfrom 100 to 400 km and V is solved as a function of\n0, the curves of figure 32-22 result.\nAny pair of V,O values within the boundaries\nof\nthe 100- and 400-km\nV,O curves delimits possible\nconditions\nfor the formation\nof secondary\ncraters\nfound at distances in this range.

Selected frames (fig. 32-24)\nshow that the ejecta plumes of the two craters begin\nto interact\nat 5 msec after impact of the projectiles.\nAt 10 msec after impact, some modification\nof the\nejecta plumes has occurred, as shown by a bifurcation\nof the leading edge of the up-range ejecta plume. The\nshort up-range arm of this bifurcating\nejecta plume\nrepresents material that has collided with that ejected\nfrom the down-range\ncrater. Material missing the\nejecta plume of the down-range crater is represented\nat 10 msec by the longer ann of\'the bifurcated\nejecta\nplume. As crater growth continues\nfrom 20 to 100\nmsec, the collision zone grows in length. At 40 msec\nafter impact, the nearly vertical collision zone is the\nprominent\nfeature of the combined\nejecta plumes.\nFor purposes of illustrating\nthe mechanism\nfor the\nridge formation,\none may imagine the ejecta plumes\nas being frustums of inverted right-circular cones, the\n\nCRATER STUDIES\n\nLl\nil\nll\n50\n\n0\ncm\n\n(CI\n\nFIGURE 32-23.-Photographs of experimental crater doublets resulting from simultaneous impact at various angles.\nProjectiles impacted from the direction at bottom of\nphotographs (experiment numbers i parentheses).

If one were to\nassume that the collision was inelastic, then the\ncollision zone would be approximated as a conic\nsection. In this case, intersection of the two conical\nejecta plumes results in a section approximated by a\nhyperbola. Net horizontal components of velocity of\nall collision products along this hyperbola are directed down range because of the higher horizontal\ncomponents of velocity for material ejected from the\nup-range crater toward the down-range crater. Therefore, the collision hyperbola moves down range and\ngradually deposits as a V-shaped ridge on the target\nsurface with the V pointing toward the direction\n\n32-23\n\nfrom which the impacting fragments arrived. This\nhypothesized mode of formation has been confirmed\nby detailed calculations of a more rigorously developed model, even where the collision is assumed not\nto be perfectly inelastic and where equations of\nmotion of particles before collision are related to\nequations of motion of collision products through\nconservation of momentum equations. The results\nshow a concentration of ejected particles in a zone\nperpendicular to the crater pair. Based on these modeling observations, it is concluded tentatively that\nlunar herringbone components result from collision\nof material ejected from the adjacent craters.\nAlthough most lunar herringbone patterns occur in\nassociation with long secondarycrater chains, laboratory simulations of the herringbone pattern components presented thus far were accomplished by\nimpacting only two projectiles to form only two\nadjacent craters. Two projectiles were used to provide\ngood control of the experimental conditions. However, one additional experiment was performed\nwhereby three projectiles impacted simultaneously\nto form a chain of three craters. Figure 32-25(a)\nshows this crater chain and two well-developed ridges\nradiating from between adjacent craters, and it is\napparent that formation of an additional crater does\nnot impair formation of the ridges. The chain of three\nsecondary craters from Copernicus (figs. 32-19 (inset\n(c)) and 32-20) also is included (fig. 32-25(b)) for\ncomparison with the experimental craters.\nIn all of the experimental results thus far presented, the axis of symmetry of each crater pair was\nparallel with the flight line of the projectiles, and the\nprojectiles impacted with sufficient separation on the\ntarget surface to produce nearby tangential craters.\nThese conditions model the typical secondary craters,\nfor which the axis of symmetry of adjacent circular\ncraters is on a radial line from the center of the\nprimary crater. Although most secondary craters of\nCopernicus and Aristarchus illustrated in the preceding figures were of this type, there are also many\nexamples of lunar crater chains for which the axis of\nsymmetry is at an angle to the radial line from the\nprimary crater. Figure 32-26 shows some examples of\nthese Copernicus secondary craters and their laboratory analogs. Each photograph is oriented such that\nthe direction of the flight line of the projectiles or the\nradial line from the primary crater is from bottom to\ntop. The axis of symmetry of the Copernicus secondaries shown in set A is coincident with the radial line\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n32-24\n\nc e 60"\n,\n\nI\n\n=\n\nV\n\nt\n\n=\n\n=\n\nT\n\n=\n\n0.82 kmlsec\n0.3 msec\n\nI\n\n0\n\nI\n\nt = 5 msec\n\nt\n\nt\n\n=\n\n20 msec\n\nt = 30 msec\n\nt\n\n=\n\n60 msec\n\nt\n\n=\n\n80 msec\n\nI\n\nI\n\n50\n\ncm\n\n0.1 msec\n\nt\n\nI\n\nI\n\nt\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n10 msec\n\n40 msec\n\n100 msec\n\nFIGURE 32-24.-Selected frames from high-speed motion picture record showing interaction of ejecta\nplumes; t is time after impact.\n\nfrom Copernicus and is the typical case (ref. 32-23).\nWhen this occurs, the V-shaped ridge is positioned\nsymmetrically about the crater-pair axis of symmetry.\nExperimental craters of set A that simulate this case\nhave a similarly positioned axis of symmetry for the\nV-shaped ridge. However, when the axes of symmetry\nof the lunar and laboratory crater chains are at an\nangle a to the radial line from the primary crater or\nto the flight line, respectively, the ridge axis of\nsymmetry is rotated with respect to the crater-pair\naxis of symmetry. For each crater pair shown in set\nC, the crater-pair axis of symmetry is rotated counterclockwise, but the ridge axis of symmetry is rotated\nclockwise with respect to the crater-pair axis. Set D\nshows the opposite case, in which the crater-pair axis\nof symmetry is rotated clockwise but the ridge axis of\nsymmetry is rotated counterclockwise with respect to\nthe crater-pair axis.\n\nOther changes in laboratory craters, due to\nchanges in azimuth of the crater pairs, also resemble\nthe effects observed for lunar craters. Note that for\nthe lunar and laboratory craters shown in sets C and\nD of figure 32-26, the arm of the V-shaped ridge\ndown range or farthest from the primary crater is\nlonger and wider than that up range or closest to the\nprimary crater.\nOne other detailed comparison can be made\nbetween laboratory and lunar craters. Some examples\nof apparently single-particle, circuIar secondary craters derived from Aristarchus, with V-shaped ridges,\nhave been illustrated in figure 32-21. At first, it\nseemed difficult to account for such features by the\nproposed mechanism of collision of particles ejected\nfrom separate impact points. However, when two\nprojectiles were impacted very near one another, a\nnearly circular crater resulted with a V-shaped ridge\n\nCRATER STUDIES\n\n32-25\n\nV = 0.82 kmlsec\nSID = 0.26\n\n-\n\ne 82.50,\n(b)\n\n=\n\nU\n\n5\n\n0\n\nkm\n\n0"\nSet A\n\nu\n0\n5\nkrn\n\nFIGURE 32-25.-Comparison of three simultaneously produced laboratory craters with lunar crater triplet.

The arrows indicate the inferred\ndirection to the primary crater (part of Lunar Earthside Chart LMP-1).\n\nfied photographs of these crater groups are shown as\ninsets on the metric camera photograph of figure\n-~\n32-28. The apparent source craters of only two crater\nchains can be found. Aristarchus and Kepler appear\nto be the source craters for the crater chains shown in\ninsets (f) and (c), respectively. However, the sources\nof the other crater chains are not obvious. The chains\nin insets (a) and (b) are apparently due to a source to\nthe west of the area, and the doublets in insets (d)\nand (e) are apparently due to a source to the south. It\nis probable that the sources of some isolated crater\n\nchains may never be located and that they can be\nidentified as secondary-impact craters only through\nthe presence of a herringbone pattern or ridges\nradiating from the crater chain. However, it is of\nconsiderable interest that this area of the lunar\nsurface (fig. 32-28) contains secondary-impact crater\ngroups derived from at least four different primary\ncraters. Therefore, this serves as direct evidence for\nlong-range transport of foreign constituents to one\ncommon lunar surface area.\nOne unexpected result of these observations is the\n\nCRATER STUDIES\n\n32-27\n\nFIGURE 32-28.-Area northwest of Aristarchus Crater (Apollo 15 metric camera frame AS 15-2490).\nInsets (Apollo 15 panoramic camera frames) correspond to locations designated in figure 32-27.\n\nsuggestion, based on the presence of such ridges, that\nthe Davy Crater chain may be a secondary-impact\ncrater chain. Figure 32-29 includes portions of Apollo\n16 metric and panoramic photographs of the Davy\nCrater chain that were exposed under several different lighting conditions. The arrow superimposed on\n\neach photograph points to a part of the crater chain\nthat has well-developed ridges radiating from the\npoint of crater overlap. These ridges are especially\nevident on the panoramic camera frame AS16-4668.\nAlthough ridges might also result from simultaneous pyroclastic eruptions, a preliminary search for\n\n32-28\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\nridges associated with such eruptions in Hawaii has\nnot revealed them.\' In addition, it seems unlikely\nthat many adjacent eruptions would occur at exactly\nthe same time, whereas simultaneous impact formation of adjacent secondary craters should be expected. If the Davy Crater chain is due to secondary\nimpact, it would be of interest to locate the primary\ncrater. In principle, it may be possible to determine\nthe direction and angle of impact of the secondary\nfragments from study of crater-chain ridge structure.\nIt may not be possible, however, to determine the\nimpact velocity; therefore, it may be difficult to\ncompute the range to the primary crater.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nIn summary, these preliminary results indicate that\nthe lunar herringbone pattern is a common characteristic of secondary-impact cratering. The pattern results from collision of material ejected from separated\nimpact points. Moreover, these results suggest that\nmany lunar secondary craters were produced by\nfragments impacting the lunar surface at high angles\nfrom the surface normal. Finally, many isolated\ncrater chains, such as the Davy Crater chain, that\npreviously were thought to be volcanic forms may in\nfact have been produced by secondary impacts.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFIGURE 32-29.-Davy Crater chain at various Sun elevation\nangles.

Analysis of\nthe echo yielded an estimate of surface roughness in\nterms of rms slopes.\nThe trace of the points of the Apollo 15 bistaticradar experiment crosses Mare Serenitatis from the\nregion of Mons Argaeus t o a point approximately 8\nkm north of Bessel Crater and then to longitude 10\'\nE and latitude 23.6" N. Roughness (rms slope)\nestimates are representative of areas 5 to 10 km in\nradius for each specular point; the results are shown\nin table 33-11. The rms slopes are large where the\nsurfaces visually appear rough and are small where\nthey appear smooth. Type 11, 111, and IV surfaces\ndiffer in surface roughness. Type I1 has larger rms\nslopes than type I11 (ref. 33-17). Type N has the\nlowest rms slope, except in the vicinity of the crater\nBessel where an increase in roughness can be attributed to ejecta from Bessel and crater clusters. Type I\ncannot be distinguished from type IV by the bistatic\nradar; type V was not sampled.\n\nPhotography\nApollo orbital photographs show a noticeable\ndifference in the crater populations of the type I and\nIV surfaces. Figure 33-2, an enlarged metric camera\nphotograph, shows the contact of these two surfaces.\nThe type I surface has more kilometer-size craters and\nis older (part C of sec. 29) than the type IVsurface.\nA detailed study of the Apollo 17 metric photographs\nacross this contact showed significantly fewer craters\nwith diameters of 60 m and less in the older type I\nmaterial, suggesting a deep regolith and possible\nmantle. Presumably, these smaller craters were\nformed entirely in a fine-grained material and did not\nexhume bedrock. Thus, these craters were probably\ndestroyed by erosion faster than similar-size craters\nthat penetrated into bedrock of the younger type IV\nmaterial. Assuming a crater depth-to-diameter ratio of\n1 to 5, the depth of this fine-grained material in the\ntype I material is 12 m or more.\nApollo photographs also indicate more surface\n\nFIGURE 33-2.-A small region from Apollo 17 metric\nphotograph AS174451 located at 23" E, 18" N, showing\na belt 50 km i length along the contact between the type\nn\nI material (the darker material to the south) and the\nyounger type IV material.\n\nrocks on the type IV surface than on the type I\nsurface. Panoramic photographs across the type I to\ntype IV boundary were enlarged, and rocks 2 m and\nlarger were counted for five areas of 25 km2. Rock\npopulations were 12 to 16 rockslkm\' for the type IV\nmaterial and 0.2 to 2.5 rocks/km2 for the type I\nmaterial. This large contrast in rock population would\nbe expected to give different eclipse temperatures;\nthese different temperatures were not observed.\nRefined estimates of surface rock abundances may be\ngiven by the infrared scanning radiometer (sec. 24)\nthat was flown on Apollo 17.\n\nX-Ray Fluorescence Observations\nThe X-ray fluorescence experiment flown on the\nApollo 15 mission indicated a chemical composition\ndifference between the type I and type IV surfaces.\nAluminum-to-silicon intensity ratios for Mare Serenitatis and Mare Tranquillitatis prepared by Adler et al.\n(ref. 33-18) are listed in table 33-111. For Mare\nSerenitatis, five of seven observed ratios range from\n0.55 to 0.62; for Mare Tranquillitatis, 11 of the 12\npoints range from 0.67 to 0.89. The measurement\npoints for Mare Tranquillitatis are in lunar areas\nobserved to have the same blue color, low radar\nbackscatter, thermal enhancement, and dark albedo\nthat characterize the type I surface. Five measurement points for Mare Serenitatis are in the central\narea, the type IV surface, and two points share the\ntype I1 and IV units. Thus, the type I surface has a\n\nAPOLLO\n17PRELIMINARY\nSCIENCE\nREPORT\n\n33-8\n\nTABLE\n33-III.-Aluminum-to-Silicon\nIntensity\n\nrelation to Ti content is inferred, as shown in table\n33-I.

The remote sensing responses\nof the bluest\nsurface, type I, are identical to those of the Apollo 11\nsite in Mare TranquiUitatis,\nwhere rocks are high in\ntitanium (Ti) and iron (Fe). Thus, the responses that\ncharacterize\ntype I may result, in part, from high Ti\nand Fe contents. Darker and bluer maria are expected\nto have high Ti and Fe contents relative to lighter and\nredder maria, according to Pieters et al. (ref. 33-19).\nTypes I and IV have the extreme colors, from which a\n\ndant on the younger type IV (red) surfaces than on\nbluer surfaces, this condition will explain the higher\nradar return from the type IV surfaces. The conclusion that rocks are more abundant\non type IV\nsurfaces is tentative,\nhowever,\nbecause the eclipse\ntemperatures\n(which depend upon surface rocks) are\nnearly\nconstant\nacross Mare Serenitatis.\n(A slight\nthermal\nenhancement\nin eastern\nMare Serenitatis\nseems to be correlated with wrinkle ridges and will be\nthe subject of a future study.) The small changes in\nbistatic-radar\nrms slopes indicate that slopes can be\nruled out as major factors in altering radar backscatter for the areas considered here (part B).\nThe thicker\nregolith\nof the type I material,\ndeduced in our detailed investigation\nof the type I to\ntype IV contact shown in figure 33-2, could also\naccount for the reduced radar echoes as compared to\nechoes from type IV material. One might expect high\nbackscatter\nfrom a thin regolith,\nin which the\nbedrock interface\nand numerous blocks are near the\nsurface. The opposite result, however, is suggested by\nthe generally lower radar echo from mare areas than\nfrom highland areas, where the regolith is generally\nthicker.

For example, the Diophantus\narea departs positively\nabove 1250 m -2 and negatively below 312 m -2 (fig. 33-3(c)). Both the Ranger\nVII and Surveyor VII areas depart negatively from\nlinearity\nat high and low values (figs. 33-3(b) and\n33-3(c)). Thus, one should consider the possibility\nthat two or more populations\nof echo strength are\npresent in the distributions.\nCumulative\nfrequencies\nof echo strength plotted\non log-log paper reveal the character of the distribution for large values of echo strength (fig. 33-4). In\nmany cases, distributions\nof the largest echo strengths\nare nearly linear on log-log plots. The upland part of\nthe Apollo 17 area is a good example (fig. 33-4(c)).\nNotable\nexceptions\ninclude\nthe Surveyor\nI (fig.\n33-4(b))\nand Surveyor\nVII (fig. 33-4(c)) sites. Features responsible\nfor the frequency\ndistributions\nof\nlarge values of echo strength\nare discussed in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n\nAREAL\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nOF ECHOES\n\nStronger\nechoes (> 1250 m -2)\ncan often be\ncorrelated\nwith Earth-facing\nslopes larger than the\nresolution cell of the radar (_ 2.0 km). Comparison\nof approximately\n1:1 000 000 scale maps of depolarized\nradar echoes with photographs\nand lunar\ncharts show that large values of echo strength are\nusually associated\nwith craters in mare areas and\nmountains,\ncraters,\nand massifs in upland terrain.\nSome features, especially fresh craters, smaller than a\nresolution\ncell (_ 2.0 km) also gave large echoes.\nEcho strengths\nlarger than 625 m -2 are associated\nwith the crater Moltke and its flanks, Moltke B, and\nSabine E in the Apollo 11 (and Surveyor V, Ranger\nVIII) area. Values larger than 1250 m -2 are associated with the east or Earth-facing\nwall of Moltke.\nDepolarized echo maps of the Diophantus-Delisle\narea\nclearly show that slopes of crater walls facing the\nEarth (northwestern\nwalls) have the largest echo\nstrengths;\nthose facing away have smaller echoes.\nEchoes from the northwestern\nwall of Diophantus\nexceed 10 000 m -2, whereas the opposite wall has\nvalues less than 2500 m -2. At sites near uplands,\nsuch as Apollo 15, echo strengths larger than 1250\nm-2 are associated\nwith Earth-facing\nslopes in the\nMontes Apenninus,\nwhile slopes facing the opposite\ndirections\nhave values of 625 m -2 and less. Thus,\nlarge-scale topography\naffects the magnitude\nof echo\nstrength.\n\nSTUDIES\n\n33-13\n\nComparison\nof the photographs\nand depolarized\necho maps also indicates that these features produce\nthe positive departures\nfrom linearity seen in figure\n33-3. For Flamsteed,\na small sample within\nthe\nSurveyor I sample, all values in excess of 1250 m-2\nare due to the west walls of Flamsteed,\nFlamsteed E,\nand a small crater 35 km north of Flamsteed\nE.\nSome, but not all, echoes above 625 m -2 are also\nassociated\nwith these craters. Similar correlations\noccur at other sites, so we conclude that the positive\ndepartures\nfrom llnearity in the frequency\ndistribution are caused by steep Earth-facing\nslopes.\nTopographic\nfeatures smaller than the resolution\ncell of the radar also affect echo strengths.\nThis can\nbe illustrated\nby South Ray Crater at the Apollo 16\nlanding site. Echo strengths near South Ray, which is\napproximately\n680 m across, are large. Values of echo\nstrength overlying South Ray are approximately\n2060\nm-2; those approximately\n2 km away from it are\n1550 to 2690 m -2. (The values used here are 10\ntimes larger than those used in reference 33-24, which\nwere purposely\ndivided\nby 10 as a matter\nof\nconvenience.)\nBecause the resolution\ncells are near 2\nkin, roughness due to the crater, ejected blocks, and\nthe hummocky\nflanks may contribute\nto the echo\nstrength. Echo strengths between 990 and 1570 m -2\nare associated with North Ray, a 1-km crater at the\nApollo 16 site. For North Ray, it is likely that some\nof the echoes arise from the slopes of crater walls and\nwest flanks of the craters that face the Earth, and\nsome of the echoes arise from buried\nfragments.\nSimilar results are found in the Diophantus\narea\nwhere craters smaller than 500 m with bright halos\nproduce relatively large echoes. Thus, it seems likely\nthat Earth-facing\nslopes at all scale lengths down to\n0.5 cm substantially\naffect the radar echoes.\n\nDETAILED\nAT THE\n\nCORRELATION\nOF ECHOES\nAPOLLO\n17 LANDING\nSITE\n\nCorrelations\nof depolarized\nradar echoes for the\nApollo 17 landing\nsite were made at scales near\n1:1000000\nand 1:250000.\nCorrelations\nat the\nsmaller scale (fig. 33-5) yield the results described in\nthe previous section. Large craters have strong echoes,\nespecially on their Earth-facing (northeastern)walls.\nExamples include Vitrivius E, Littrow B, and the\ncrater complex\nnorth of Littrow B. Earth-facing\nslopes in the highland\nregion\nhave large echo\nstrengths, whereas those facing away are substantially\n\n33-14\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\n1.0\n\n.1\n\nc\n\n,_o\n/\n.01\n\n.001\n\nO Apollo14 (median, 65)\nr_ Ranger rg(median, 991\n\n1=\n\n_ Surveyor I (median, 380)\nO Apollo1.5(median, 360)\n17 Ranger_\n(median, 200)\n\nr_\n\n.0001\nI0\n\n100\n\n(b)\n\n.O01\n\no\n\n1 000\n\n10000\n\nEcho strength, m -z\n\nApollo 11 (median, 380)\n\nQ Apollo 12 (median, 410)\nA\n\nApollo 16 (median, 420)\n\n<> Apollo17 mare(median, 440)\n.0001\n100\n\n|\n1 000\n\nI\n10 0Q0\n\nEcho strength, m-2\n\n(a)\n\nFIGURE\n33-4.-Cumulative\nfrequency\ndistributions\nof depolarized radar echo strengths plotted on log-log graphs.\n(See table 33-IV.)

The low values\nof echo strength just south of Littrow B (fig. 33-5)\ncontrast with the higher ones to the west, but no\nsimilar contrast in surface roughness is evident.\nAdditionally, echoes from some low hills in the\nsouthwestern corner of the area of figure 33-6 are not\nparticularly large. Here, small-scale roughness or\nblocks smaller than photographic resolution may be\nresponsible for the differences in echo strength for\nthe surfaces.\nDetails of the Apollo 17 landing site further\nillustrate the influence of surface topography on\n\nFIGURE 33-5.-Correlation of echoes to topography in the\nTaurus-Littrow area.

The Apollo 17 lunar module (LM) landed on a mare regolith in a valley\nsurrounded by hills rising some 2450 m above the\nvalley floor. North of the LM (fig. 33-6), the North\nMassif rises some 2000 m above the valley floor and\nslopes are as large as 25\'. Here, and for similarly\noriented Earth-facing steep slopes, values of echo\nstrengths exceed 4000 m-\' and are as large as 9670\nm-\' (fig. 33-6(a)). In contrast, the steep slopes\n25\') of the South Massif to the southwest of the\nLM face away from the Earth, and depolarized echo\nstrengths range between 3 14 and 900 m-\' . In this\ncase, it is difficult t o attribute the differences in the\nechoes t o anything but slopes because the crewmen\nreported that rock outcrops were present high on\nboth slopes and, in both cases, boulders from the\noutcrops were present on and at the bases of the\nslopes.\n\nAPOLLO 17 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n33-1 6\n\nExplanation\nLight mantle\nDark mantle\nKnobby hills\n\n0\n\n"\nU\n\n0\n\n4\n\nkm\n\n(a)\nFIGURE 33-6.-Correlation of echoes to topography of the\nApollo 17 landing site.

(b) Photographic mosaic of Apollo 17 landing site (Apollo 17 panoramic camera frames AS17-2309,2311, 2312, and 2314).\n\nThe regolith of the valley floor near the LM had\necho strengths from 564 to 1103 m-?, which are\nsomewhat larger than the median values for mare\nareas (table 33-IV). Echo strengths decrease from the\nLM area toward the southwest where there are few\nlarge craters. Some of the lower echo values (505 to\n589 m-\') were from the eastern part of the light\nmantle. The difference correlates well with the\nobservations of the LM pilot who reported that 3 to 5\npercent of the surface was covered by 1-cm and\nlarger-size fragments near the LM area and 1 percent\nof the surface was covered by I-cm and larger-size\nfragments near and on the light mantle. The panoramic camera photographs also show (fig. 33-6(b))\nthat there are more large steep-walled craters near the\nLM than on the eastern edge of the light mantle. The\nlowest echo strengths are found where large craters\nare absent, rare, or subdued by mantling; as near the\nsoutheastern edge of the light mantle, just south of\nFamily Mountain, northwest of Family Mountain,\nand area A (fig. 33-6(a)).\n\nkm\n\nIn contrast to some premission inferences, the\nlarge depolarized echoes near the light mantle do not\ncorrelate with the light mantle. There are two lines\nof evidence for this: (1) the large echoes are displaced\nwestward of the light mantle and include mare\nsurfaces west of it, and (2) the large echoes span the\nvalley from the base of the South Massif to the base\nof the North Massif whereas the light mantle does not\n(fig. 33-6(a)). The orbital photographs suggest that\nthe large echo values are caused by a concentration of\ncraters up to several hundred meters across that form\na band along the western part of the light mantle and\nadjacent mare and extend beyond the mantle to the\nbase of the North Massif.\nComparison between echoes at the Apollo 16\nlanding site and Apollo 17 landing site supports the\npostulate that factors other than small fragments and\nblocks produce differences in depolarized radar\nechoes. For the Apollo 16 landing site, the echo was\n530 m-\'\nor approximately one-half the value of\n1103 m-\' at the Apollo 17 landing site. Although\nprecise data are not at hand, it is our impression that\nthe number of blocks and fragments in the immediate\nvicinity of the Apollo 17 landing site was no larger\nthan the number in the immediate vicinity of the\nApollo 16 landing site.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTopography appears to be an important factor in\ncontrolling the amplitude of depolarized echoes. This\nis particularly evident at the Apollo 17 landing site\n\nREMOTE\nSENSING PHOTOGRAMMETRIC\nAND\nwhere echoes from the Earth-facing\nslopes of the\nNorth Massif are substantially\nlarger than those from\nopposing\nslopes on the South Massif; also, in the\nregion of the light mantle, the relatively large values\nof echo strength correlate\nwith craters up to several\nhundred meters across-rather\nthan with the mantle\nitself.\nThe cumulative\nfrequency\ndistributions\nof the\ndepolarized\nechoes are, in some respects,\nsimilar to\nslope-frequency\ndistributions\nobtained\nfor mare and\n\nPART\nCOMPARISON\n\nSTUDIES\n\nupland\nsurfaces.

Perhaps\na suitable test to assess the role of topography\non\ndepolarized\nradar echoes will be to compare\nthe\nechoes with the rms slopes obtained by the bistaticradar experiment\non the Apollo 14, 15, and 16\nmissions.\n\nC\n\nBETWEEN\nPHOTOGRAMMETRIC\nAND\nSLOPE-FREQUENCY\nDISTRIBUTIONS\n\nBISTATIC-RADAR\n\nH.

Stereomodels\nwere leveled and scaled from\nancillary data derived from orbital support data)\nTo\ncalculate slopes, three elevation measurements\nwere\naveraged for points separated by a horizontal\nfLxed\ninterval. This fixed horizontal interval will be referred\nto as slope length AL in the following discussion.\nApproximately\n500 to 600 slopes were determined\nfor each slope-frequency\ndistribution.\nSlope-frequency distributions\nwith 25-m slope length are\ncorrected\nfor reading\nerrors\nas outlined\nin the\nappendix.\nSlope-frequency\ndistributions\nfor larger\nslope lengths do not require this correction.\nTwo\nstatistical descriptors\nare used, mean absolute slope\nand algebraic standard deviation. Mean absolute slope\nis the average of the absolute\nslope angle values.\nAlgebraic standard deviation\nis estimated\nfrom the\ncumulative absolute slope-frequency\ndistribution\nand\ntaken as the slope corresponding\nto a cumulative\nfraction of 0.32 (_ 31.74 percent) for slope lengths\nof 25 m.

For mare\nsurfaces, the absolute\nslope-frequency\ndistributions\n(cumulative\nand incremental)\nare neither exponential\nnor Gaussian. However, a large part of the distributions approach an exponential\nform (fig. 33-7). The\n\n_q\n\nlogarithm\nof cumulative\nfrequencies\nabsolute\nslopes tends to be linear\n\nplotted against\nfor the first 90\n\npercent or more of the sample. This approximation\nholds for distributions\nwith slope lengths AL of 25 to\n500 m. Cumulative\nfrequency\ndistributions\nfor the\nCayley Plains at the Apollo 16 landing site (ref.\n33-25) are similar to maria distributions\nand show a\ntendency\nfor linearity (fig. 33-8). Inspection\nof the\nincremental\nform of the distribution\nfor 25.1-m slope\nlength (fig. 33-8(a)) shows the steps between 4 \xc2\xb0 and\n10 \xc2\xb0 are parallel to the cumulative curve, while a small\nmode occurs at 13.5 \xc2\xb0. The frequency\nof slope angles\nbetween\n0 \xc2\xb0 and 1\xc2\xb0 is larger than expected\non the\nbasis of the adjacent steps but consistent with overall\ntrends. For the incremental\nform of the Apollo 16\ndistribution\nat 201-m slope length (fig. 33-8(b)), the\nsteps decrease uniformly from 0 \xc2\xb0 to 6 \xc2\xb0 and the tail of\nthe cumulative\ncurve above 7 \xc2\xb0 is the result of large\ncraters at the site.\n\nIIII\n\nKnobby\nand cratered\nupland\nterrain\nslope-frequency distributions\ndepart markedly from those of\nthe maria and Cayley Plains.

Simultaneous 13- and ll6-cm\ndata are given for the Apollo\n15 experiment\nonly.

As mentioned\npreviously,\n\nLunar slope-frequency\ndistributions\nmay be inferred directly\nfrom the bistatic-radar\ndata. The\nmethod is based upon a geometric\noptics model of\nthe scattering and a previously\ndeveloped inversion\ntechnique (refs. 33-27 to 33-29). Earlier comparisons\nof lunar rms slopes obtained\nusing photographic\ntechniques with those obtained\nfrom the radar have\ngiven good results (ref. 33-30).\nFor a particular\nlocation,\nthe data are averaged\nalong the bistatic-radar\ntrack on the lunar surface. In\nall cases, this track trends along a nearly east-west\ndirection for a distance of up to 2 \xc2\xb0 lunar longitude.\nIn latitude,\nthe extent\nof the averaging\narea is\ndetermined\nby lunar surface roughness.\nFor the\npresent\ndata, this extent\nvaries between\napproximately 0.5 \xc2\xb0 and 1.0 \xc2\xb0. The data are uncorrected\nfor\nthe spacecraft antenna pattern. In general, as a result\nof this effect, one may anticipate a slight suppression\nof the slope distribution\nfor slopes greater than\napproximately\n15 \xc2\xb0. To facilitate comparisons,\nall data\n\nThe Ptolemaeus\nfloor apparently\nhas fewer slopes\ngreater than approximately\n8 \xc2\xb0.\nFigure 33-12 gives distributions\ninferred from 13and 116-cm data for a region near Vitruvius. The two\ndistributions\nare quite distinct; this region appears\nmuch smoother\non the set of scales associated with\n\nthese data apply to a smoothed version of the lunar\nsurface from which surface frequency\ncomponents\nwith periods shorter than approximately\n0.5 m have\nbeen removed.\nThe apparent\nslight modality in the\ndata may not be real. These data are quite similar to\ndistributions\nobtained from the floor of Ptolemaeus.\n\nthe 116-cm wavelength\nthan on the set of scales\nassociated\nwith the 13-cm wavelength.\nIn our data\nthus far, this is an anomalous\nhighland result. It has\nbeen a general observation that 13- and 116-cm slopes\nin highland areas show much less marked wavelength\ndependence\n(refs. 33-17 and 33-29).\nFigure\n33-13 gives bistatic-radar\nresults\nfor a\nregion in central Mare Serenitatis.\nBoth distributions\nclosely resemble Gaussians for low values of slope\nlength but depart from the normal distribution\nfor\nvalues of slope greater than approximately\n1\xc2\xbd to 2\nstandard deviations. The elevated tails of this distribution with respect to the Gaussian are a general feature\nof maria distributions\nobserved thus far.\n\nREMOTE\nSENSING\nANDPHOTOGRAMMETRIC\nSTUDIES\nSlope\n\n33-23\n\nLength\n\nNo single surface scale may be assigned to the\nradar data, nor is there a quantitatively\nwell-known\nrelationship\nbetween\nsurface slope and radar wavelength. Slope data inferred from bistatic-radar\nobservations correspond\nslopes With lengths\n\nto a weighted average over all\ngreater than some minimum value.\n\nThis weighting is also thought to vary weakly with\nslope. For the data here, the minimum slope lengths\nthat will affect the data are estimated to be approximately 0.2 and 2.0 m for the 13- and 116-cm data,\nrespectively.\nThe scale length of slopes of maximum\nimportance in the weighting is estimated to be greater\nthan 10 to 100 wavelengths.\nFor both wavelengths,\nslopes longer than about 500 m are unimportant.\nWithin a slope distribution,\nhigher slopes are expected\nto correspond to slightly shorter scales.\nPrevious comparisons\nof bistatic-radar\ndata with\nslopes obtained\nfrom photogrammetry\nand photoclinometry (ref. 33-30) indicate that the bistatic-radar\ndata correspond\napproximately\n230\nupon observations\nthe lunar Explorer\n\nto a surface sampling\nscale of\nwavelengths.\nThis result is based\nat 220-cm wavelength\nmade with\n35 spacecraft.\nIf this result scales\n\nwith wavelength,\nthen the corresponding\nvalues of\nsurface sample length for the 13- and 116-cm data are\n30 and 270 m, respectively.\nThese values must be\ninterpreted\nas an approximate\nmean for the bistaticradar slope length weighting function.\nA striking feature of the bistatic-radar\ndata is the\nsimilarity of the 13- and 116-cm results for slope\ndistributions\nand rms slopes in the lunar highlands.\nThis result can be understood\nin terms of surfaces\n\n0\n\nI\n10\n\n5\n\nSlope angle,\n\nI\n15\n\nI\n20\n\nthat contain no significant roughness component\non\nscales less than a few times the longer wavelength.\nIn\nmaria, a strong wavelength\ndependency\nis observed.\nThus, the radar results are generally consistent with\nthe photogrammetric\nresults in which only a weak\ndependence\non slope length is observed in highlands\nareas, but for which much stronger dependencies\nexist in maria areas (cf. fig. 33-10).\n\nfleg\n\nMagnitude\n\nFIGURE\nderived\n\n33-11.-Incremental\nfrom\n\nas predominantly\n\nE).\n\n13-era\n\nslope-frequency\nbistatic-radar\n\nCayley\n\nFormation\n\ndata\n\ndistribution\n\nin a region\n\nmapped\n\nOat. 8.1 \xc2\xb0 S, long\n\n10 \xc2\xb0\n\nThe magnitude\nof lunar rms algebraic\nslopes\ninferred from bistatic radar is also a strong function\nof lunar terrain type and slope lengths.

We have examined the\neffect of Sun elevation angle on repeatability,\nusing\nApollo 15 photographs\n0Vu, unpublished\ndata), and\nextended the results to slope-related effects.\n\nOF RESULTS\n\nthis preliminary\nevaluation, repeatability\nmeasurement\ncan be related to contrast\n\nof\nin\n\nthe immediate\nscene of the stereoscopic\nimage. The\ncontrast is, in part, dependent\non Sun elevation angle,\nand high-contrast\nlow-Sun\nphotographs\nallow the\nobserver to perceive a well-defmed\nsurface. At high\nSun elevation angles, low contrast results in loss of\ndetail and the surface may be poorly defined. The\nresults comparing\nrepeatability\nand slope angle are\nnot as dear, but a correlation\nof slope angle and\nstandard error was found for the metric camera data\nin the Taurus-Littrow\narea. This correlation\ncould\narise from contrast\ndifferences\nresulting\nfrom the\nangle between the Sun and local slopes partly tilted\ntoward the Sun. Alternatively,\nthe correlation\ncould\nbe related to albedo because the area traversed also\nincludes units with a wide range of albedos-higher\nalbedos occurring\nin the rougher terrain and lower\nalbedos occurring in the smoother terrain. Thus, we\ncannot distinguish\nbetween\nthe effect of slope and\naU.S. Geological Survey.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nS. C. l_u, a Francis J. Schafer, a Gary M.

Additionally,\nthe lengths and slopes for one\nof the traverses on metric photography\noccur at an\nangle near 90 \xc2\xb0 to the Sun direction. Nevertheless, the\nresults from the low Sun elevation angles (16.5 \xc2\xb0 and\n30.5 \xc2\xb0) suggest a correlation of some kind that may be\nrelated to slope tilted away from or toward the Sun,\nor related to albedo, both albedo and slope, or some\nother factor unknown at this time.\n\nEVALUATION\nELEVATION\n\nOF SUN\nANGLE\n\nElevation\nmeasurements\nfrom Apollo 15 metric\ncamera stereomodels of 11 different sites, each having\ndifferent\nSun elevation angles that vary in approximately 10 \xc2\xb0 intervals from 1\xc2\xb0 to 80 \xc2\xb0, reveal a clear\nrelation between repeatability\nof elevation measurements and Sun elevation angle.

We have\nobtained data correlating standard errors of measurement and local slope angle.\nIn this study, three elevations were measured on\nsecond-generation metric camera master-positive\ntransparencies at points separated by fixed horizontal\nintervals of approximately 500 m along traverses\n\n33-37\n\nshown in figure 33-21. Standard errors of measurement were then correlated with 570 or more values of\nabsolute slope (tables 33-VI11 and 33-IX). The results\nof these correlations are shown in figure 33-22. A\ngood correlation between standard error and slope\nangle is found for the case (fig. 33-22(a)) where the\narea Sun elevation angle is 16.5"; but where Sun\nelevation angles are 30.5" and 50.5", little or no\ncorrelation is found between standard error and slope\nangle.\nA similar study conducted with panoramic photographs for two areas confined to the area of the\nApollo 17 landing site, where albedo is more or less\nuniform, suggests a variation of standard error with\nslope angle. The methods used here are the same as\nthose used for the metric camera data, and approximately 620 points were measured three times each\n(tables 33-VI11 and 33-IX). Spacing between the futed\nintervals was approximately 25 m along traverses\nshown in figure 33-19. Here, a positive correlation\nbetween standard errors of elevation measurements\nand slope is found (fig. 3-23) and standard errors for\nsmall slopes tend to be smaller than those for large\nslopes.\nIn the panoramic photographs, the dependence\nbetween standard error and slope could arise solely\nfrom low-contrast areas where local bright slopes are\ngenerally inclined toward the Sun and local high-contrast areas where slopes are inclined away from the\nSun. Because the traverses were confined to the dark\nfloor of the Taurus-Littrow valley, we postulate that\nslopes measured perpendicular to the Sun direction\nhave components generally tilted toward the Sun.\n\n33-38\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\n_o\n\n_\n\n"_\n\n"_\n\n"_\n\n\'_\n\n"_\n\nII\n\ne_\n\n\xc2\xb0_\n\nI\n\ni\nC\nI\n\n_\n\n_\n\nw-I\n,.d\n\nII\n\n2_\n\nIi\n_\n\n_\n\nII\n\nO\n\n15 -\n\n15 0\n\n0\n\n14\n\n14-\n\no\n\n13-\n\n13\n\no\n\no\n\nE\n\nE\n0\n0\n\ne-\n\no\n\n12-\n\no\n\n12\n\nE\n\n0\n\n_= 11 -\n\nE 11\n\ntO\n\no\n\nc\no\n\n\xc2\xae 10 -\n\n0\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\n0\n\n0\n\no\n\no\nO\n\n0\n\no\n_\n\n0\n\no\n\n0\n\no\n\n9\n\n"_ 9_o\no\n\no\n\nc\n\n0\n\no\n\n0\n0\n\no\no\n\no\n\n8\noo\n\n0\n\n8-\n\no\no\n\n0\n\no\n\no\n\no\no\n\no\n7-\n\n7\n\n0\n\nI\nI0\n\n60\n\nI\n20\n\nI\n30\n\nSlope angle, deg\n\n(a)\n\nI\n10\n\n6\n0\n\nI\n20\n\nI\n30\n\nSlope angle, de9\n\n(b)\n\n14FIGURE\n\no\no\n13-\n\n0\n\no\n\n12 -\n\n33-22.-Standard\n\nerrors for elevation\n\nmeasurements\n\nand absolute\nslope angle.

Wollenhaupt,\n\n17 LASER\n\n(mapping)\ncamera or independently.\nIn the camera\nmode, the laser altimeter\nranges at the time of each\nexposure,\nwhich varies between 20 and 28 sec (i.e.,\n30 to 43 km along the lunar surface).\nIn the\nindependent\nmode, the laser altimeter ranges every 20\nsee.\n\nThese altitude data and the spacecraft attitudes\nthat are derived from simultaneous\nstellar photography are used to constrain\nthe photogrammetric\nreduction\nof the lunar surface photographs\nwhen\ncartographic\nproducts are generated. In addition, the\naltimeter\nmeasurements\nalone provide\nbroad-scale\ntopographic\nrelief around the entire circumference\nof\nthe Moon (i.e., they provide direct information\non\nthe figure of the Moon).\n\nALTIMETER\nc G. Schubert,\n\nINSTRUMENT\n\nThe laser altimeter weighs approximately\n22.5 kg\n(50 lb) and consists of a ruby laser, transmitting\nand\nreceiving optics and telescopes,\nand a range counter.\nWhen a signal is received from the control circuit (ref.\n33-33), the pulse-forming network discharges through\nflashlamps,\nproducing\na light pulse that primes the\nruby rod such that light amplification\noccurs. A\nQ-switch is used to transfer\nthe light pulse to the\noutput resonant reflector.\nThe Q-switch is a rapidly\nrotating\nmirror that moves into angular alinement\nwith the output\nresonant reflector\nat the point of\nmaximum\ngain in the ruby rod. This alinement\ncreates a very high feedback situation, which sweeps\nout the energy stored in the ruby rod in the form of a\nlaser pulse of approximately\n15 nsec duration\n(ref.\n33-33). The output of the laser at this point has a\ndiameter of 0.635 cm (0.25 in.) and a beam width of\n\naNASA\n\nLyndon\n\nb Jet Propulsion\nCUniversity\n\nB. Johnson\n\nSpace\n\nCenter.\n\nc and W. M. Kaula c\n\n4.8 mrad. A 16-power telescope then transforms\nthe\nbeam to a 10.16-cm\n(4 in.) diameter with a beam\nwidth of 0.3 mrad. This range corresponds\nto 30 m\non the lunar surface for a spacecraft altitude of 100\nkm. A portion\nof the output\nis applied\nto a\nphotodiode\nto generate a start pulse, which is sent to\nthe range counter through a delay line. The delay line\nis calibrated to compensate\nfor the delay through the\nreceiver photomultiplier\nand the video amplifier. The\nrange counter counts increments of 6.67 nsec (providing a 1-m resolution)\nsupplied by a 149.8962-MHz\ncrystal oscillator. The return pulse, which is reflected\nfrom the lunar surface, is applied to the photomultiplier tube through the receiver telescope. The electrical output of the photomultiplier,\namplified by the\nvideo amplifier, stops the range counter.\nFinally, the\ncount is converted to range and telemetered.\n\nMISSION\nTHE\n\n33-41\n\nE\n\na W. L. S]ogren, b R. E. Lingenfelter,\n\nThe laser altimeter\nmeasures precise altitudes of\nthe command service module (CSM) above the lunar\nsurface and can function\neither with the metric\n\nSTUDIES\n\nOPERATORS\n\nSeveral changes were made to the Apollo 17 laser\naltimeter\nin an attempt\nto avoid the degraded\nperformance\nexperienced\nduring the Apollo 15 and\n16 missions.\nThe major\nmodifications\nwere (1)\nchanged to an oil-impregnated\ntype bearing in the\nQ-switch rotor to eliminate\ncontamination\nof the\noptical surfaces and (2) changed envelopes on flashlamps to a high-quality\nquartz (Suprasil) to maintain\na higher flashlamp\nlight output\nlevel. The laser\naltimeter\noperated\nexcellently\nthroughout\nthe mission, so well that it was turned on for six consecutive\nrevolutions\ntoward\nthe end of the mission. Laser\nfirings totaling 4026 were made on lunar revolutions\n1 and 2, 13 and 14, 15, 23 and 24, 27 to 29, 38 and\n39, 49, 62 and 63, 65 and 66, 67 to 72, and 73 and\n74. There will be 11 to 12 almost complete sets of\ndata containing\nmeasurements\naround\nthe entire\ncircumference\nof the Moon in the orbital plane.\n\nANALYTICAL\n\nTECHNIQUES\n\nLaboratory.\n\nof California\n\nat Los\n\nAngeles.\n\nAn accurate\n\nestimate of spacecraft\n\nposition\n\nwith\n\n33-42\n\nAPOLLO\n\n17 PRELIMINARY\n\nrespect to the Moon is required\nto interpret\nthe\naltimeter\nmeasurements\nfor the purpose of selenodetic figure investigation.\nThis estimate was made by\nreducing the Earth-based Doppler radio tracking data\nof the orbiting CSM. These are essentially line-of-sight\nvelocity measurements\ntaken every 10 sec by at least\ntwo tracking stations of the Space Tracking and Data\nAcquisition Network. The Doppler data are processed\nusing a weighted least-squares technique to determine\na unique orbit for the CSM. A theoretical\nmodel of\nthe Earth-Moon\nsystem is included in the computations. The accuracy of the determined\norbit limits the\naccuracy of the laser altimeter results. The dominant\nerror source in the orbit determination\nand trajectory\nprediction process is the mathematical\nmodel used to\ndescribe the lunar gravitational\neffects. No known\nmathematical\nmodel\naccurately\ndescribes\nthe observed gravitational\neffects, at least in a global sense.\n(The far side has never been measured.) The absolute\nradial position uncertainty\nis approximately\n400 m.\nHowever, the relative radial position uncertainty\nof\nsuccessive altimetry\npoints along an orbital track is\nless than 10 m. Furthermore,\nthe relative position uncertainty between two nearly parallel tracks will be\nappreciably less than 400 m, since the two orbits will\nbe affected similarly by the principal error source, the\ninadequacy of the gravitational model.\nAfter the spacecraft\norbit has been determined,\nthe laser altimeter measurements\nare subtracted\nfrom\nthe corresponding\nselenocentric\nradius vectors of the\nCSM orbit to obtain\ncomplete\nlunar topographic\nprofdes. Because the CSM orbit is a dynamic solution\nabout the center of gravity (c.g.) of the Moon, the\nprofile is referenced\nto the c.g. rather than the center\nof the optical figure. (The c.g. is also the more\nimportant\ncenter, of course, in analyzing the structural significance of the topographic\nelevations. There\nare also corrections\nthat can be applied to the laser\nmeasurements\nto correct for timing and laser pointing\nto adjust the slant range measurements\nto altitudes\nabove the local vertical. The data required\nto make\nthese corrections\nare usually not available\nuntil\nseveral months\nafter the mission.\nHowever,\nthese\ncorrections\nshould\nlowing results.\n\nnot\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nsignificantly\n\nchange\n\nthe fol-\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe topographic profde resulting from the analysis\nof altimetry measured on revolutions\n27 to 29 of the\n\nSCIENCE\n\nREPORT\n\nApollo 17 spacecraft\nis given in figure 33-24. For\nmost of the larger near-side features, the altitudes are\nremarkably close to those measured by the Apollo 15\nexperiment,\nthe groundtrack\nof which is usually\nwithin approximately\n200 km of that of the Apollo\n17 experiment\nand intersects it over Mare Serenitatis.\nThe elevations\nof Mare Serenitatis\nand the two\nadjacent maria, Imbrium\nand Crisium, are virtually\nthe same in both the Apollo 15 and 17 data. The\nMontes\nApenninus\nand Montes\nTaurus\nare also\napproximately\nthe same in the two orbits. However,\nfarther west there is some difference (due to diverging\ngroundtracks);\nthe Montes Carpatus show up in the\nApollo 17 data, and Oceanus Procellarum\nis perhaps\n0.5 km lower under Apollo 17 than under Apollo 15.\nTwo pronounced\nfeatures unique to the Apollo 17\ndata are the deep craters Reiner and Neper, with\ndepths\nof 5 and 6 km, respectively,\nbelow the\n1738-km\nsphere.\nFor a crater as small as Reiner\n(25-km diameter), this depth is quite remarkable.\nOn the far side, the appearance\nof the Apollo 17\nprofile is also similar to the Apollo 15 profile but,\nbecause the terrain\nis so much rougher,\nonly a\nqualitative\ncomparison\ncan be made. The Apollo 17\ndata also show a depression near 180 \xc2\xb0 longitude, but\nnot quite as broad or as deep as shown by Apollo 15\ndata; the greatest depth is not quite 4 km below the\n1738-km sphere.\nFrom the limited data available at this time, it\nappears that Apollo 17 altimetry gives approximately\nthe same mean radius of 1737.3 km, and an offset of\ncenter-of-figure\nfrom center-of-mass\nalong the EarthMoon line slightly larger than 2 km.\nThe Apollo 17 groundtrack\nintersects the Apollo\n16 groundtrack\nat a greater angle near longitudes\n100 \xc2\xb0 E and 80 \xc2\xb0 W, both in terrae terrain. Nonetheless, the two profdes\nin these regions.\n\nappear\n\nto agree within 0.50 km\n\nREFERENCES\n33-1.

Dunkelman,\n\nThe Apollo 17 mission provided the fourth and\nfinal opportunity\nto photograph\nastronomical\nphenomena from the double umbra, the darkest region of\nthe universe yet reached by man. In this region, no\nsunlight\nor earthshine\nilluminated\nthe spacecraft\nduring a portion of each lunar orbit. Moreover, the\ndark lunar disk provides such excellent occultation\nof\nthe Sun that regions of the solar corona and the\nclose-in zodiacal light have only become accessible for\nnatural study from lunar-orbiting\nApollo spacecraft.\nIn this situation,\ncrewmen\nusing high-quality,\nbut\n\nb and R. E. Evans c\n\nthe ecliptic plane. Before this mission, no data in\ncolor or polarized light had ever been obtained in the\necliptic plane from approximately\n3 \xc2\xb0 to 18 \xc2\xb0 from the\nSun.\nThis zodiacal\nlight photography\ncontinues\nthe\nwork begun on Apollo 14 and continued\nthrough\nsubsequent\nlunar missions. The Apollo 15 mission\nprovided excellent photographs\nin unpolarized\nwhite\nlight (ref. 34-1). On the Apollo 16 mission, there was\nan unsuccessful\nattempt\nto obtain\nplane-polarized\nwhite-light measurements\nof zodiacal light (ref. 34-2).\n\nunsophisticated,\nhand-operated\ncamera systems have\nbeen able to obtain data quickly\nthat cannot be\ngathered\nfrom the ground\nor from Earth-orbiting\nsatellites by any techniques yet devised. The zodiacal\nlight extending\neastward from the Sun was recorded\nin three separate series of photographs.\nEach of these\npresunrise series includes overlapping frames covering\nelongation\nangles from 80 \xc2\xb0 to 0.5 \xc2\xb0 eastward along\n\nTHEORY\nSunlight scattered from the countless small particles of interplanetary\ndust in heliocentric\norbits gives\nrise to the zodiacal light.

It may also produce some evidence on the types\nof constituent\nmaterials\nfrom which these particles\nare composed (ref. 34-4).\n\nEQUIPMENT\nThe\n55-mm\n\nNikon\nlens\n\n35-mm\nset\n\nat f/1.2\n\ncamera\nand\n\nwas\n\nused\n\nthe polaroid\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nor color\n\nfilters just ahead of the objective lens. Emulsion was\nKodak type 2485, high-speed,\nblack-and-white\nrecording\nfilm. The camera was bracket\nmounted\nbehind\nthe right rendezvous\nwindow\nand pointed\nalmost parallel to the plus-X axis of the spacecraft\nwhen color filters were used; it was pointed 30 \xc2\xb0 away\nfrom the plus-X axis towards the minus-Z axis when\nthe larger polaroid\nfilter was used to gain the\nnecessary extra window clearance. When the color\nfilters were used, a light-tight window shade with an\nopening for the camera lens was used to exclude from\nthe camera optics the stray cabin light that might\notherwise\nbe reflected\nfrom the window.\nDuring\npolaroid photography,\ncabin lighting was reduced to a\nminimum. Because fdter orientation\nhad to be manually changed by the 90 \xc2\xb0 rotation between\nthe window shade could not be used.\n\nframes,\n\nPreflight calibration\nexposures\nwere added to the\nflight film. These calibrations\nwere performed\nby\nusing an illuminated\nstep-wedge\nfrom\nthe High\nAltitude Observatory\nto provide brightness values in\nterms of the surface brightness of the Sun (ref. 34-5).\nThe preflight\ncalibration\nexposure\nunderwent\nthe\nsame radiation, temperature,\npressure, and humidity\nconditions\nas the data frames. Every shutter speed\nplanned for use in the data frames was used in the\ncalibration frames so that emulsion reciprocity\ncharacteristics could be completely taken into account.\n\nwas in the double\n\numbra\n\non revolution\n\n49. Each set\n\nwas composed of two photographs\nthrough a polaroid\nfdter that was rotated 90 \xc2\xb0 in orientation\nbetween the\ntwo photographs.\nThe maximum change in polarized\nbrightness\noccurs between two perpendicular\nplanes:\nthe first plane contains the Sun, the spacecraft,\nand\nwhatever point in the zodiacal light is being observed;\nthe second plane is perpendicular\nto the first plane\nalong the line of sight. Ground-based\npolarization\nmeasurements\nhave been made over a number of\nyears of the outer zodiacal light, but airglow and\natmospheric\neffects made data reduction\ndifficult\n(ref. 34-6).\nFor the zodiacal light tasks, the optical axis of the\ncamera was initially pointed\nin the direction\nof the\nmotion of the spacecraft\nwith respect to the Moon.\nThe optical axis was maintained\nin this attitude\nby\npitching\nthe spacecraft\nat lunar-orbital\nrate. This\nallowed the 36 \xc2\xb0 by 24 \xc2\xb0 field of view to be aimed\nclose to the ecliptic plane, with one corner of the\nframe viewing that portion of the lunar limb cutting\nacross the ecliptic. Stellar images on the data frames\nprovide excellent\npostflight\nreferences\non pointing\naccuracies;\nthey also indicate image motion on the\nlonger exposures\ncaused by the pitching rate of the\nspacecraft and other small attitude corrections.\nA series of zodiacal light photographs\nin red-fdtered light was obtained\non revolution\n23. The\nbandpass was approximately\n620 to 700 nm. Exposure times of 90-see duration were used initially for\npositions farthest from the Sun. These exposure times\nwere correspondingly\ndecreased as the brightness of\nthe zodiacal light increased; the final exposure duration was one-thirtieth of a second within 0.5 \xc2\xb0 of the\nSun. The red series of exposures provided 10 frames\nof data; all were conducted at the times and exposure\ndurations specified in the checklists except that the\nthird exposure, scheduled for a 60-sec duration, was\nunderexposed\nbecause of an early shutter\nclosure.\nHowever, the overlap between frames was such that\nthis region was recorded by exposures both before\nand after the lost data frame. A second identical\nseries of photographs was made on revolution\n28 in\nblue-fdtered light with an approximate bandpass of\n420 to 510 nm. The blue series of 11 exposures was\n\nASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY\n\n34-3\n\nFIGURE 34-1.-The zodiacal light photographed on December 12, 1972, ushg a Nikon 35-mm camera\nwith the 55-mm lens set at f/1.2, color filters, and Kodak type 2485 film.

As expected, the calibration data showed\n\nthe film to be more sensitive to blue light than to red\nlight. However, the inner zodiacal light within\napproximately 1\' of the Sun showed a stronger red\n5\ncomponent in and close to the ecliptic plane.

Evans b\n\nThe outer\natmosphere\nof the Sun (the solar\ncorona) extends\nfrom near the visible solar limbs\nthroughout\nthe interplanetary\nmedium.\nThus, the\nEarth is actually embedded in the coronal flow (solar\nwind) that moves outward\nfrom the solar surface.\nThis flow of material from the Sun has been observed\nin situ in the vicinity of the Earth orbit by interplanetary satellite probes during the past decade. However,\nthe nature of the solar wind flow near the Sun where\nthe outflowing gas is accelerated is poorly understood\nand has yet to be observed.\nThe structure\nof the\ncorona near the Sun, where the material\ncan be\ncontained\nby the coronal\nmagnetic\nfield, is also\ncomplex and poorly understood.\nThe evolution\nof\ncoronal\nstructures\nis particularly\nobscure.\nOther\nfundamental\nquestions include the origin and growth\nof major coronal structures and their relationship\nto\nsolar activity.\nBecause the brightness\nof the solar corona is less\nthan one one-hundredth\nmillion of that of the direct\nsolar disk, observations\nof the corona can only be\nmade when the solar disk is blocked,\nHowever,\nbecause of the large dynamic range of the radiance of\nthe solar corona (_ 104), the sensors of such instru-\n\naHigh Altitude Observatory.\nbNASA Lyndon B.

Atmospheric\nscattering of sunlight prohibits\nobservations\nof the outer corona (greater than 1 solar\nradius above the solar limb) with coronagraphs\nfrom\nEarth\nobservatories\nand, because\nof sensor constralnts, Earth-orbiting\ninstruments\nare generally designed to observe the inner corona (less than 10 solar\nradii above the solar limb).\nThe geometry\nof the lunar orbit of the Apollo\ncommand\nand service module\n(CSM) provided\na\nunique\nopportunity\nfor observations\nof the outer\nsolar corona by occulting the CSM from both sunlight\nand earthshine\n(sunlight\nreflected\nfrom the Earth).\nSolar coronal\nobservations\nfrom\nthe Apollo\n15\nmission provided photographs\nof streamers extending\nto 40 solar radii from the solar limb, and the Apollo\n16 observations\nprovided\nexcellent\ndata on the\nradiance of the corona as a function of distance from\nSun center. Because the solar corona is constantly\nchanging as a function of solar activity, the Apollo 17\nobservations\nwere designed to corroborate\nthe Apollo\n16 data on radiance as a function of distance and to\nprovide data on any new coronal streamers present\nduring the Apollo 17 mission.\nSolar corona photography\nwas scheduled on revolution 25 to observe the eastern half of the corona\nand on revolution 61 to observe the western half. The\nsequence\n\nscheduled\n\non revolution\n\n61 was not accom-\n\nASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nplished. The revolution-25 sequence consisted of\nseven photographs with exposures of 10, 4, 1, 1/2,\n1/8, 1/30, and 1/60 sec, starting 75 sec before sunrise\nand ending 10 sec before sunrise. The sequence was\nmade using the Hasselblad electric camera with\n80-mm lens set at f/2.8 and with high-speed, blackand-white, Kodak type 2485 recording emulsion. The\nspectral region photographed with the spacecraftwindow/2485-film combination is approximately 425\nto 700 nm. This spectral region was not chosen to\nprovide spectral information on the solar corona but\nrather to utilize the maximum bandwidth and shorten\nthe exposures as far as possible.\n\nRESULTS\nTwo coronal streamers are evident in the photograph taken 10 sec before sunrise. Although these\nstreamers seem to appear in the photograph taken 30\nsec before sunrise, photographic techniques and\nmicrodensitometry will be required to determine\ntheir full extent. One streamer lies almost along the\necliptic plane; the other is south of the ecliptic plane\nand apparently corresponds to a feature that has been\n\nFIGURE 34-2.-The solar corona photographed approximately 75 sec before sunrise on December 12, 1972\n(AS 17-154-23647).\n\n34-5\n\nobserved by both the Orbiting Solar Observatory 7\n(OSO-7) and the Mauna Loa Observatory for two\nsolar rotations (mid-October to mid-December) before the Apollo 17 observations. The OSO-7 and the\nMauna Loa Observatory observations are being analyzed to determine the evolutional characteristics of\nthe streamer, and the Apollo 17 data could provide\ninformation on the full extent of the streamer from\nSun center at the time of the Apollo 17 observations.\nIn addition, the crew made real-time sketches that\nshow the same two streamers; both the sketches and\ndebriefing comments of the crew indicate clearly\nidentifiable streamers extending to Jupiter, which is\n24.4" (= 100 solar radii) from Sun center. This\nidentification is a tribute to the wide dynamic range\nor adaptability of the human eye.\nMicrodensitometer tracing of the lo-, 4-, 1-,1/2and 1/8-sec exposures has been accomplished, and\npreliminary analysis shows good correlation between\nthe Apollo 16 and the Apollo 17 data on radiance as\na function of distance from Sun center. Radiance\ninformation from the Apollo 17 data will extend to\napproximately 25\' from Sun center. In addition,\nattempts to enhance the contrast between the coronal\nstreamers and the background are in progress to\nextend the available data on the streamers that were\nobserved for several months. Digital techniques of\npicture averaging and enhancement, currently under\ndevelopment as part of the High Altitude Observatory\nApoUo Telescope Mount Program for the Skylab\nmissions, will be applied to these photographs. All\ndata reduction thus far has been accomplished on the\nHigh Altitude Observatory Boller and Chivens model\n14213 microdensitometer.
