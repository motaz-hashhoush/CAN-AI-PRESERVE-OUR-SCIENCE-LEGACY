SPACESIM is being developed to greatly improve existing spaceports and to aid in designing, building, and operating future spaceports, given that there is a worldwide trend in spaceport operations from very expensive, research- oriented launches to more frequent commercial launches. From an operational perspective, future spaceports are expected to resemble current airports and seaports, for which it is necessary to resolve issues of safety, security, efficient movement of machinery and people, cost effectiveness, timeliness, and maximizing effectiveness in utilization of resources. Simulations can be performed, for example, to (1) simultaneously analyze launches of reusable and expendable rockets and identify bottlenecks arising from competition for limited resources or (2) perform what-if scenario analyses to identify optimal scenarios prior to making large capital investments. SPACESIM includes an object-oriented discrete-event-simulation engine. (Discrete- event simulation has been used to assess processes at modern seaports.) The simulation engine is built upon the Java programming language for maximum portability. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used for storage of data to enable industry-standard interchange of data with other software. A graphical user interface facilitates creation of scenarios and analysis of data.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100010985, "id": "106871d3ab324682ac4e4f6f361b8621", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, September 2007", "publicationDate": "2007-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20100010894, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, September 2007", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100010985.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100010985/downloads/20100010985.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100010985/downloads/20100010985.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100010985/downloads/20100010985.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
