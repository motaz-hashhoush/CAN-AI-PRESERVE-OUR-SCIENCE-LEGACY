Our launch support included preparations and rehearsals for the support during the mission, preparation for the SMOV and ERO program, and work to have the science team's data pipeline (APSIS) and data archive (SDA) ready by launch. A core of the team that was at the GSFC during the EVA that installed ACS monitored the turn-on and aliveness tests of ACS. One hour after installation of ACS in the HST George Hartig was showing those of us at Goddard the telemetry which demonstrated that the HRC and WFC CCDs were cooling to their preset temperatures. The TECs had survived launch! After launch, the team had several immediate and demanding tasks. We had to process the ERO observations through our pipeline and understand the limitations of the ground based-based calibrations, and simultaneously prepare the EROs for public release. The ERO images and the SMOV calibrations demonstrated that ACS met or exceeded its specifications for image quality and sensitivity. It is the most sensitive instrument that Hubble has had. The ERO images themselves made the front page of all of the major newspapers in the US. During the months after launch we have worked on the SMOV observations, and are analyzing the data from our science program.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030005706, "id": "f7ae492f7f9d4a20a3cd01bad64b1ab0", "publicationDate": "2002-11-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030005706.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030005706/downloads/20030005706.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030005706/downloads/20030005706.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030005706/downloads/20030005706.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
