The initial decision to undertake the program and the three agreements signed to begin its implementation are examined, and the division of responsibilities and financial contributions is discussed insofar as it affected the management structure. Consideration is given to the major facilities, the 50-mission operational cycle, communications, the currently scheduled activities (through 1985), the prospective later uses, and the ten dedicated discipline laboratories. The importance of continuous mutual support during the planning and development phases is stressed. The program so far is considered a success, in terms of the goals set by the participants and in terms of the resolution of the problems inherent in international technological endeavors.", "title": "Spacelab - Ten years of international cooperation", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T01:04:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840028938, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bignier, M."}, "organization": {"name": "ESA", "location": "Paris, France"}}, "id": "3b6552d0b47a43c8bfec588230725370"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19840028938, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Harrington, J.
