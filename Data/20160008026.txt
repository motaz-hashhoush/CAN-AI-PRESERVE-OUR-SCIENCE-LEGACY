The program offers\nincentive prizes to generate revolutionary solutions to\nproblems of interest to NASA and the nation. The program seeks innovations from diverse and nontraditional\nsources. Competitors are not supported by government\nfunding and awards are only made to successful teams\nwhen the challenges are met.\n\nThe core of Centennial Challenges: opportunity,\ninnovation, and communication.\n\nIn keeping with the spirit of the Wright Brothers and\nother American innovators, the Centennial Challenge\nprizes are offered to independent inventors including\nsmall businesses, student groups, and individuals. These\nindependent inventors are sought to generate innovative\nsolutions for technical problems of interest to NASA\nand the nation and to provide them with the opportunity\nto stimulate or create new business ventures.\nThe West Virginia University Mountaineers took home a Level\xc2\xa01\nprize for $5,000 at the 2014 Sample Return Robot Challenge.\nThey and one other team have also earned the right to attempt\nLevel 2 at the 2015 event, with a potential prize purse of\n$1.5 million.\n\n74\n\nfor the remaining prize money in 2015. The challenge\nwill be competed again in June 2015.\n\nThe Cube Quest Challenge offers up to a $5 million prize purse\nfor communication with a CubeSat near or beyond the Moon.\n\nAnticipated Benefits\nCentennial Challenges advance technologies that are\ncurrently technology barriers for NASA to achieve its\nfuture goals. Challenges conducted address current topics on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s technology roadmap that are also beneficial to other technology sectors here on Earth.\nCompeting teams have a unique opportunity to leverage their ideas whether they win prize money or not.\nThrough the visibility of the challenges, all participants\ngain the opportunity to be seen by and network with\nother industries who may be searching for similar solutions, as well as to interact with each other, media outlets, and with the public at outreach events.\n\nAlso, the new Cube Quest Challenge <www.nasa.gov/\ncubequest> opened for registration in November. Cube\nQuest offers a total of $5 million to teams that meet\nthe challenge objectives of designing, building, and\ndelivering flight-qualified, small satellites capable of\nadvanced operations near and beyond the Moon.\nCube Quest teams will have the opportunity to compete for a secondary payload spot on the first integrated\nmission of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Orion spacecraft, and the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s\nSpace Launch System (SLS) rocket.\n\nMuch of the technology developed through these competitions has been adopted by the agency, academia,\nand/or the commercial sector and infused into their\nrespective industries for use and continued advancement. It is the hope and goal of the program that solutions discovered via challenges will continue to grow\nand benefit others in areas outside of each challenge.\n\nThe competition includes three stages: Ground Tournaments, Deep Space Derby, and Lunar Derby. All teams\nmay compete in any one of the four Ground Tournaments. Teams that rate high on mission safety and probability of success will receive incremental awards. The\nGround Tournaments will be held every 4 to 6 months,\nleading to an opportunity to earn a spot on the first integrated flight of Orion and SLS.\n\nNotable Accomplishments\t\n\nReferences\t\n\nIn 2014, the program completed the third running of the\nSample Return Robot Challenge, an autonomous rover\ncompetition held at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in\nWorcester, MA. Seventeen teams competed in the twolevel challenge for a $1.5 million prize purse. The West\nVirginia University Mountaineers completed Level 1,\nwinning $5,000 and the opportunity to attempt Level 2\n\nVisit <www.nasa.gov/winit> for more information on\nthe program, upcoming and past challenges.\n\n75\n\nCCP\n\nPotential Applications\n\nAlso this year, two new challenges were announced\nand opened for registration. The Mars Ascent Vehicle\n(MAV) Challenge <www.nasa.gov/mavprize> is helping to advance the technology to return samples from\na planetary surface. The challenge focuses on getting the samples from the surface to orbit for collection and return to Earth. The MAV Challenge requires\nhighly reliable and autonomous sample insertion into\nthe rocket, launch from the surface, and deployment of\nthe sample container. Innovative technology from this\ncompetition may be considered in future planning for\na planetary exploration mission. Centennial Challenges\nis partnering with the NASA Student Launch to conduct this challenge in parallel with the Student Launch\ncompetition.\n\n'
