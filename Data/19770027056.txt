Excluded from the scope of this survey are\n\ninertial confinement schemes based on irradiatiig fuel pellets with\n\nlasers or relativistic particle beams; pinches; minor variations of\n\nthe tokamak concept itself; and devices which cannot feasibly be used\n\nas a fusion reactor; including those which have conductors entirely\n\nsurrounded by plasma.\n\nUSES AND DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF FUSION REACTORS\n\nThe programs to develop fusion reactors in major industrialized\n\ncountries all assume that such reactors will be used only by the elec\xc2\xad\ntric utilities,\ncations.\n\nHowever, fusion reactors could have many other appli\xc2\xad\n\nSome potential applications of fusion reactors are listed\n\n\nin Table I, along with the primary requirements for each.\n\nA major\n\n\napplication is large stationary power plants, which includes power\n\ngeneration for electric utilities; steam generation and space heating;\n\n\n4\n\nnuclear steel making, that is, the use of fusion rather than chemical\n\nenergy to produce steel; chemical processing; water purification; and\n\nconversion of fertile to fissile material, that is, the breeding of\n\nfuel to be used in conventional nuclear power plants.\n\nFusion power plants\n\n\nfor such applications should have oier-all costs that are comptetitive wlth othe3\n\nprimary fuelS. They must be reliable, and they must, have minimal environ\xc2\xad\nmental intrusion.\n\nTABLE I\n\nAPPLICATIONS OF FUSION POWER PLANTS\n\n\nRE2UIREMENTS\n\n\nAPPLICATION \t\n1. \t\nElectric Utilities\nSteam Generation and Space Heating\nNuclear Steelmaking\nChemical Processing\nWater Purification\n\nConversion of Fertile to Fissile\n\nMaterial\n\n2, Space Power and Propulsion\n\nA.\nB.\nC.\n\nCompetitive Capital Cost\n\nReliability\n\nMinimum Environmental\n\nIntrusion\n\n\n3. \t\nMilitary\n\nA.

Steady-State Operation\n\nB. High Beta\n\nC. Self-Sustaining Fusion Reaction\n\nD. Advanced Fuel Cycles Possible\n\n\nE.\nF.\nG.\nH.\nI.\n\nDirect Conversion to Electrical Power\n\nSmall Size and Power Output\n\nNo Neutrons or Activation of Structure\n\nEnvironmentally Safe\n\nHigh Capital and Resource Productivity\n\n\nIn the first place, a fusion reactor-should operate in the steady\n\nstate.\n\nPower interruptions associated with cyclic operation are awkward\n\n\nfor the utilities if the interruptions are comparable with, the thermal\n\ntime constant of the plant.\n\nMany of the pulsed or inertially confined\n\n\nconcepts suffer a disadvantage because it is more difficult to. extract\n\nenergy with high efficiency when it is released in a pulsed.manner.\n\nPulsed fusion reactors also suffer the disadvantage that they must be\n\ndesigned to bear the maximum thermal and mechanical stresses, rather\n\nthan designing to the average values appropriate to a steady-state\n\nreactor.\n\nIt is generally believed that the magnet c.ost for a fusion reactor\n\nwill be minimized if the reactor operates at a high value of beta,\n\nthe ratio of plasma to magnetic energy density.\n\nHigh values of beta\n\n\nimply smaller reactor sizes, lower capital investment in the magnetic\n\nfield, containment structure, and blanket, and less synchrotron radia\xc2\xad\ntion for a favorable energy balance.\n\nIt is desirable that a fusion reactor be capable of a completely\n\nor nearly self-sustaining fusion reaction in which the energy released\n\nin charged particles is used to heat the incoming fuel in the plasma\n\n\n7\n\nitself, rather than heating the fuel with large or expensive external\n\nequipment prior to injection0\n\nA fusion reactor should be capable of operating with advanced fuel\n\ncycles (fuel cycles other than the DT reaction) since such fuel cycles\n\nrelease more of their energy in the form of charged particles,\n\nSome advanced\n\n\nfuel cycles (the proton-boron-il, for example) are capable of operating\n\nwithout producing energetic neutrons. The DD reaction has cross-sec=\n\ntions second highest only to the DT reaction and uses a plentiful fuel\n\nwhich is available without breeding.\n\nAdvanced fuel cycle reactors which release their energy in the form\n\nof charged particles should be capable of operating in such a way\n\nthat the energetic charged particles, which would otherwise diffuse to\n\nthe walls of the containment vessel, can be scavenged and converted to\n\nelectrical power by one of several direct conversion schemes.\n\nFor military or space applications, it would be desirable if\'a\n\nselfsustaining fusion reactor were of small enough size and power\n\noutput that it could operate as a mobile power source.\n\nAny fusion reactor must be environmentally safe, and one means of\n\nminimizing possible radiation hazards is to use one of the advanced\n\nfuel cycles which either do not generate neutrons or minimize the neutron\n\ngeneration and/or activation of the reactor structure.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE TOKAMAK CONCEPT\n\nFairly detailed design studies of the tokamak concept, such as those\n\nsummarized by Davis and Kulcinski (ref. 3) have indicated a capital\n\n\n8\n\ncost and a cost of electricity at least equal to that of fission and\n\nbreeder reactors.\n\nSuch findings have led some representatives of the\n\n\nelectrical power industry to question the viability of the tokamak\n\nconcept as an energy source for the electrical utilities, regardless\n\nof its value in demonstrating fusion feasibility (refs. 6 and 7).\n\nIt is therefore of interest to examine the limitations of tokamaks to\n\nprovide a basis for comparison with other concepts.\n\nWhen measured against the criteria discussed in Table II, the present\n\ntokamak fusion reactor conceptual designs (refso 4, 6, and 7) are seen\n\nto have limitations in several areas0\n\nThese are listed in Table 1II.\n\n\nTABLE III\n\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE PRESENT TOKAMAK CONCEPTUAL DESIGNS\n\nA0\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\n\nMust Operate in Cyclic Manner\n\nLow Beta Required for Stability\n\nAdvanced Fuel Cycles Appear Infeasible\n\nFusion Reactions May Not be Self-Sustaining\n\nCapital and Resource Productivity No Better Than Fission Reactors\n\nMassive, Stationary Power Plant\n\nThe tokamak concept cannot operate in the steady state, because\n\n\nthe plasma currents in the toroidal direction serve a double function;\n\nthey not only create and heat the plasma by ohmic heating, but these\n\ncurrents also generate the poloidal magnetic field which is required\n\nto confine the plasma.\n\nWhen this plasma current decays below a certain\n\n\nthreshold, confinement is lost and the plasma must be restarted in a\n\ncyclic manner.\n\nVarious design studies estimate that a tokamak fusion\n\n\n9\n\nreactor might burn for a few minutes to one hour, and that oie tr a\nfew minutes might be required to purge the confinement :volume and re-"\nstart the \'plasma (ref. 3).\n\nIf the down time required for purging and\n\nrestart is comparable to the steam-plant time constant, cyclic power\nproduction could be very undesirable for utility applications.,.\nAt present, it appears that stability considerations will limit\n\ntokamak fusion reactors to a low value of beta, on the order of 5%.\n\nBecause of these low values of beta, it appears difficult to operate\n\ntokamak reactors with advanced fuel cycles.\n\nThese require higher\n\n\nkinetic temperatures, and a low value of beta would require much larger\n\nvolumes or stronger magnetic fields to generate the same total power\n\noutput0\n\nIf the ion and electron temperatures of the plasma are equal, the\n\n\nmagnetic field required to confine plasmas using advanced fuels at low\n\nbeta would imply amounts of synchrotron radiation sufficient to quench\n\nthe reaction. The limitation to low beta may restrict tokamak reactors to\n\nthe DT reaction.\n\nThe current state of understanding is probably not\n\n\nsufficiently advanced to state whether or not a tokamak DT reactor would\n\nbe self-sustaining as a result of the slowing down of alpha particles in\n\nthe plasma; if significant amounts of external heating of the fuel were\n\nnecessary, as by energetic neutral injection, this would represent a\n\nsubstantial burden of capital equipment necessary to recycle the power\n0\n\nSURVBY OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO PLASMA CONFINEMENT\n\nThe devices discussed below each appear to improve upon one or\n\nmore of the limitations of the present tokamak fusion reactor designs.\n\n\n10\n\n\nSome of them, in their current versions, also have drawbacks as bad\n\nor worse than the tokamak concept.\n\nBecause these concepts are in an\n\n\nearly stage of investigation, all of their limitations and advantages\n\nare not well defined.\n\nAn attempt has none the less been made to summarize\n\n\nthe advantages and limitations of each concept in Table IV at the end\n\nof the report.\n\nTOKAMAK-LIKE DEVICES\n\nTormac\n\nThe Tormac confinement concept has been developed by M. A. Levine\n\nand his colleagues (refs. 8-11).\n\nThe current-carrying conductors\n\n\nof the Tormac concept are shown in figure 3. A current flows through\n\nthe plasma in the toroidal direction.\n\nThe arrangement of the magnetic\n\n\nfield differs from that of the tokamak in that the plasma is confined\n\nin a toroidal cusp configuration with two annular cusps or vertices\n\nfacing outward away from the major axis of the torus0\n\nThe principal\n\n\nmbtivation for this geometry is to achieve a higher degree of macroscopic\n\nplasma stability than is possible in the tokamak by using the cusp\n\ngeometry, in which the magnetic field lines tend to restrain gross\n\nmotions of the plasma.\n\nIn principle, the Tormac should be capable\n\n\nof confining plasmas at values of beta approaching unity, rather than\n\nthe low values which are necessary for stability in the tokamak.\n\nThere is some recent experimental evidence that plasma is stably\n\nconfined in the Tormac, and at higher values of beta than would be pos\xc2\xad\nsible in an equivalent tokamak.\n\nA photograph of the Tormac plasma\n\n\nis shown in figure 4. In this particular version of the Tormac, the\n\nmagnetic field is generated by thin wires connected to capacitor banks\n\n\nso that the entire plasma volume is visible.\n\nThe plasma in this ex\xc2\xad\n\nperimeiit contains strong toroidal currents\'which help to confine\'the\n\nplasma.\n\nIf these cannot be eliminated, the Tormac is basically a\'cyclic\n\n\nplasma containment concept.\n\nTopolotron\n\nThe Topolotron concept has been developed by R. W. Bass, J. H.\n\nGardner, et al. (refs 12=14) at Brigham Young University in Provo,\n\n0\nUtah.\n\nThe basic Topolotron configuration is shown in figure S, and\n\n\narose from highly abstract considerations relating to the topological\n\nproperties of toroidal magnetic field configurations.\' The Topolotron\n\nexhibits a prop6rty known as topological stability, which may also\n\nimply improved stability and confinement of a\'high beta t6roida1 plasia.\n\nA comparison of the current-carrying conductors of the\'Tormac and the\n\nTopolotron in figures 3 and 5 shows \'that they are basically an inside\xc2\xad\nout version of each other, with the two annular cusp-like vertices\n\npointing radially inward in the Topolotron and outward in the Tormaco\n\nIn the Topolotron, the currents flowing in the plasma hav4 a poloidal\n\ncomponent, like the theta pinch\n\nwhile\'they flow only in the toroidal\n\n\ndiiection in the Tormac,\n\nThe Topolotron has a further interesting property illustraied in\n\nfigure 6. The magnetic field lines on the plasma surface are indicated\n\nby the arrows in this figure, and they tend to reach limit cycles at\n\nthea two cusp-like points on the-inner circumference of the plasma\n\nvolume,\n\nWhether this limit cycle behavior also implies an undesirable\xc2\xad\n\n12\n\npiling up of particles at the two cusp points remains to be seen.\n\nA\n\n\nprojection of the poloidal component of the magnetic field is shown in\n\nfigure 7. On figure & is shown a photograph of the Topolotron apparatus\n\nin a partially assembled state.\n\nIf the Topolotron concepts could be\n\n\nscaled up to a fusion reactor, its advantages and disadvantages would\n\nbe similar to those of the Tormac.\n\nTHE EXTRAP CONCEPT\n\nThe Extrap concept has been proposed by Bo Lehnert of the Royal\n\nInstitute of Technology in Stockholm (refs. 15 and 16), and is illus\xc2\xad\ntrated by the diagram in figure 9. This axisymmetric toroidal device\n\nhas similarities to the Tormac and Topolotron.\n\nThe poloidal magnetic\n\n\nfield required for confinement is provided by four coils that encircle\n\nthe major axis of the torus, all the currents of which flow in the\n\nsame toroidal direction0\n\nThese four coils are external to the plasma,\n\n\nand in an operating reactor could be shielded from it. It is also nec\xc2\xad\nessary to have a toroidal current flowing in the plasma, much like the\n\ntokamak concept, in order to provide stability and confinement\n0\n\nThe\n\n\ncombination of the currents in the four external coils and the oppositely\n\ndirected toroidal current in the plasma itself confine the plasma within\n\nthe magnetic field lines shown in figure 9, A small version of this\n\ndevice has been tested (refs. 15 and 16) with encouraging results.\n\nAlthough this is basically a pulsed concept because of the induced cur\xc2\xad\nrents flowing within the plasmas, it has several advantages over the\n\ntokamak, including a simpler magnetic field geometry which could allow\n\neasier remote disassembly.\n\n\n13\n\n\nSTELLARATOR-LIKE DEVICES\n\nThe Classical Stellarator\n\nThe Stellarator concept was originated in the U.S. at Princeton\n\nin 1952 (ref. 17), but has fallen into relative neglect in the United\n\nStates since 1969.\n\nIn order to appreciate the merits of the stellarator\n\n\nconcept, it is helpful to understand why a simple toroidal magnetic\n\nfield is not adequate to confine a plasma.\n\nIn figurd 10 is shown a\n\n\nsimple torus with magnetic field windings around the toroida\n\nvolume.\n\n\nBecause of the effect of toroidal curvature, the current-carrying con\xc2\xad\nductors are more closely bunched on the inside circumference of the\n\nwindings\'than they are on the outside.\n\nThis leads to a stronger magnetic\n\n\nfield along the\'inside radius of the-plasma than along the outside.\n\nThe resultihg gradient of magnetic field along the major radius of\n\nthe torus causes particles of opposite sign to dtift to the top-or\n\nbottom of the torus.\n\nThis charge separation leads to electric fields\n\n\nwhich cause the toroidal plasma tol drift to the walls.\n\nIn order to\n\n\novercome this bunching of the magnetic field lines along the inside\n\ncircumference, one can twist the torus into a figure eight pattern\n\nlike that shown in figure 11.\n\nThis will assure that all of the magnetic\n\n\nfield lines have approximately equal length, and the effects of the\n\nparticle drifts will cancel as the particles traverse a complete cir\xc2\xad\ncuit of the torus.\n\nThis figure eight geometry is awkward to implement\n\n\nin an actual experiments so the same effect is achieved by a\'combina\xc2\xad\ntion of current-carrying windings illustrated on figure 12.\n\nThe tightly\n\n\nwound helix represents coils which produce the toroidal magnetic field.\n\n\n14\n\nInside the toroidal field coils are loosely wound helical windings.\n\nThe currents in adjacent pairs of the helical windings flow in oppo\xc2\xad\nsite directionS and the net effect is a magnetic field in which the\n\nfield lines rotate about the minor axis of the confinement volume by\n\nan amount proportional to the radius. The rotation of the magnetic field\n\nlines about the minor axis of the confinement volume is called rotational\n\ntransform, and the differing amounts of rotational transform as one\n\nmoves along the radius is referred to as magnetic shear.\n\nA plot of the magnetic field strength contoursand a particle\n\ndrift surface are shown in figure 13 for the Proto-Cleo device at the\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin (ref. 18).\n\nOn figure 14 is shown an experimental\n\n\ndetermination of the drift surfaces of such a stellaratoro\n\nTo obtain\n\n\nthis picture, a small electron gun was placed at various radii in a\n\nstellarator geometry, and multiple exposures of the electron impacts\n\non a fluorescent screen were made as the electron gun was moved along\n\nequal increments in radius.\n\nFigure 15 is a photograph of one of the early stellarators, which\n\nis about 1 meter by 2 meters long in a racetrack configuration.\n\nStel\xc2\xad\n\nlarator research in the U.S. has been summarized by Young (ref. 19).\n\nOutside the U.S., there currently are active stellarator research\n\nprograms in Russia, West Germany (ref. 20), England (refs. 21 and 22),\n\nFrance, and Japan.\n\nFigure 16 is a photograph of the West German\n\n\nWedelstein VII stellarator, which i symmetric without the straight\n\nsections used in the early Princeton experiments.\n\nThe only stellarator\n\n\nexperiment currently active in the United States is the Proto-Cleo\n\n\nis\nexperiment at the University of Wisconsin which is shown in figure\n\n17 (ref 18).\n\n0\nThe stellarator geometry has the important advantage over the\n\ntokamak that all the currents which confine the plasma are external\n\nto it. For this reason, the stellarator can be operated in the steady\n\nstate and does not have to be operated in a cyclic manner to re-esta\xc2\xad\nblish the-_toroidal currents.\n\nIn addition, the stellarator may be\n\n\ncapable of operating at somewhat higher values of beta than the tokamak.\n\n\nTorsatron\n\nThe torsatron is a close relative of the stellarator geometry,\nin which rotational transform and shear of the magnetic field lines\nare achieved with a much simpler conductor geometry. The torsatron\nconcept is under investigation in England (ref. 23), in Russia (ref.\n24), and in the United States (ref. 25).\n\nA simple k = I torsatron\n\nwith a single helical winding (ref. 24) is shown in figure 18o\n\nThe\n\n\xc2\xa3 = 3 torsatron conductor geometry is illustrated in figure 19 which\nis a photograph of the torsatron windings in use at the Culham Labora\xc2\xad\ntory (ref0\n\n23).\n\nThere are three conductors wound around the toroidal\n\nvolume, each of which carries current in the same direction.\n\nThese\n\nhelical windings serve the same function as the combination of toroidal\nand helical windings in a stellarator, with the poloidal component of\nthe current generating the toroidal magnetic field, and the toroidal\ncomponent of the current generating the poloidal magnetic field.\n\nThis\n\n16\n\n\nparticular geometry has a sector periodicity of 30 degrees.\n\nThe drift\n\n\nsurfaces in 5 degree increments along one of these sectors are shown\n\nin figure 20.\n\nThe windings shown in figure 19 are contained in a large\n\n\nvacuum tank, a sketch of which is shown in figure 21.\n\nA photograph\n\n\nof the torsatron plasma taken through one of the top viewports of this\n\nvacuum tank is shown in figure 22.\n\nAn examination of figures 18, 19, and 22 makes obvious the basic\n\nsimplicity of the torsatron magnetic field windings,--which is very sig\xc2\xad\niificant from an engineering point of view.\n\nThe torsatron has a further\n\n\ninteresting property which, as it happens, is not exemplified by these\n\nparticular experiments.\n\nIn figure 19 one can see the mechanical sup\xc2\xad\n\nports which bear the forces between the current-carrying conductors.\n\nWith the torsatron geometry it is possible in principle to design the\n\n4elical copductprs in such a way that they are a force-free configura\xc2\xad\ntion, that is, no net mechanical forces will act between the individual\n\nconductors.\n\nThe only forces would act along the conductors and such\n\n\nforces can be dealt with by making the conductors sufficiently strong\n\nin tension or compression.\n\nThis represents a potential saving in struc\xc2\xad\n\ntural7 material, and also can be made into a fail-safe design in which\n\none does not have to design for unbalanced magnetic forces.\n\nThe only\n\n\nforces which act on the conductors are gravitational forces, tensional\n\nforces along the axis of the conductor, and forces which arise from a\n\nfinite plasma beta relative to the force-free vacuum field configura\xc2\xad\ntion.\n\n\n17\n\n\nThe "Twisted-Coil" Ste\'llarator\n\nA serious objection to the classical stel-rarator is that it has\n\na complicated set of windings, with helical donductors wound inside the\n\nbores of the toroidal field coils.\nto assemble.\n\nSuch a configuration is difficult\n\n\nIt is even more difficult to disassemble in a fusion\n\n\nreactor context where remote handling methods will be required.\n\nThe\n\n\nTorsatron produces stellarator-like drift surfaces with helical con\xc2\xad\nductors-wound around the major circumference ,-fthe confinement volume.\n\nAn alternative is the "twisted-coil" stellarator of Rehker and Wobig\n\n(ref. 26)., the essence of which is shown in figures 23 and ,24 for the\nP, 2 stellarator and in figures 25 and 26 for-the \xc2\xa3 = 3 stellarator.\n=\nThe resulting drift surfaces are equivalent in-their confinement\nand stability properties to-those-produced by the classical stellarator\n\nor the torsatron.\n\nThe coil assembly has the important engineering ad\xc2\xad\n\nvantage that the individual coils can be removed as modules from the\n\ntoroidal array without having to disconnect a helical winding (as in\n\na classical stellarator), or-having to disconnect a helical coil which\n\nentirely encircles the major axis of the torus- (as in the torsatron).\n\nThe individual coils are shown in plan, side, and erevation views in\n\nfigures 23 and 25.\n\nIn the toroidal array, the individual coils are\n\n\nrotated in angle with respect to each other as one moves around the\n\nmajor qircumference of the torus , to produce the rotational transform\n\ncharacteristic of\n\nthe basic stellarator concept.\n\nthe coils is illustrated in figures 24 and 26.\n\nThis rotation of\n\n\nThe twisted-coil\n\n\nstellarator concept has not yet been implemented in any working device,\n\n\nThe conductor configuration of the classical stellarator represents\n\nsignificant engineering complexity. The tokamak fusion reactors described\n\nin refs. 3 and 4 have coil systems which are at least as compl4ted as the\n\nclassical stellaratoro\n\nPerhaps it would be in order to reassess the\n\n\nrelative merits of the stellarator~and tokamak, particularly the simple\n\nand modular "twisted-coil" stellarator.\n\n\nMIRROR MACHINES\n\nThe classical mirror machine has been a part of fusion research\n\n4nce its inception (see ref. 17), and consists of two regions of strong\n\nmagnetic field separated by a region of weaker field, as shown-in figure\n\n27.\n\nThe mirror field is generated by two coils, sometimes with a straight\n\n\nregion of weaker uniform magnetic field between the two mirrors,\n\nIn\n\n\nthe mirror machine illustrated in figure 27A, the currents in the two\n\ncoils are flowing in the same direction about the axis of symmetry.\n\nA variation of the mirror machine is the cusp, illustrated in figure\n\n27B, and consists of two coils with oppositely flowing currents0\n\nBoth of these confinement devices rely on the fact that when par\xc2\xad\nticles move from a region of weak field to a region of strong magnetic\n\nfield, a large fraction of the particles will be reflected from the\n\nregions of strong field if their velocity parallel to the axis is not\n\ntoo large relative to the perpendicular velocity. As long as charged\n\nparticles remain in the confinement region in velocity space, they\n\n\n19\n\nwill reflect back and forth between mirrors indefinitely, unless col=\n\nlisions cause diffusion in velocity space and knock them into the\n\n"escape cone" which results in their loss out the ends of the mirrors\n\n0\nIn the cusp geometry, the particles must be reflected not only from\n\nmagnetic mirrors at either end, but also from the line cusp which en\xc2\xad\ncircles the axis halfway between the two mirror coils0\n\nThe cusp geometry\n\n\ntherefore has an additional route of esbape for confined particles0\n\nThis additional loss must be balanced against the improved magnetohy\xc2\xad\ndrodynamic stability of the cusp configuration, which arises because a\n\nparticle sees a magnetic field increasing in all directions from the\n\ncenter of the confinement volume.\n\nThe classical mirror machines have significantly lower confinement\n\ntimes than toroidal devices.\n\nWhen confined particles undergo scattering\n\n\ncollisions, they will be knocked into the escape cone and lost more\n\nrapidly than would be the case if they suffered classical diffusion\n\nacross field lines to the walls0\n\nToroidal devices are not subject\n\n\nto mirror scattering losses because their field lines close on them\xc2\xad\nselves.\n\nAs long as toroidal devices were subject to Bohm diffusion\n\n\n(see fig. 1), the confinement times of mirror machines were competi\xc2\xad\ntive with those of toroidal devices.\n\nIn recent years, however, there\n\n\nhas been a large and growing gap in the confinement times achieved\n\nwhich favors toroidal devices0\n\nIt is now the consensus that the simple\n\n\nmirror machine cannot yield an economically feasible, net power pro\xc2\xad\nducing fusion reactor0\n\nTherefore, it various modifications, discussed\n\n\nbelow, have been introduced to improve the confinement of the simple\n\nmirror machine.\n\n\n20\nAstron and Reversed Field Devices\n\nThe astron concept was first proposed in the mid-19SO\'s (refs. 17\n\nand 27) and consists of a geometry similar to that shown in figure\n\n28.\n\nA long, solenoidal magnetic field is set up in the steady state.\n\n\nRelativistic electrons or ions are injected into this magnetic field\n\nand their energies are adjested so their gyrodiameters are comparable\n\nto the diameter of the intended plasma confinement region.\n\nThe rela\xc2\xad\n\ntivistic particles are caused to build up until the diamagnetic field\n\ngenerated by their motion exceeds that of the applied magnetic field0\n\nAt this point, the magnetic field reverses inside the layer of parti\xc2\xad\ncles, and closed magnetic field lines will encircle them0\n\nThis layer\n\n\nis referred to as an e-layer or p-layer, depending on whether relati\xc2\xad\nvistic electrons or protons are used0\n\nThe original Astron experiment\n\n\nwas terminated in 1973 without having achieved more than about 15%\n\nof magnetic field reversal (ref. 27).\n\nSubsequent experiments by Fleischmann and others at Cornell Univ\xc2\xad\nv6rsity (refs. 28 and 29) have injected relativistic electron into\n\na pulsed mirror magnetic field and achieved a field reversal in this\n\ngeometry. The essence of their approach is indicated on figure 29,\n\nand a photograph of their experiment is shown in figure 30.\n\nThis same\n\n\ngroup has also proposed to use energetic protons to create field reversal\n\n(refs. 29 and 30), and a schematic reactor concept based on ion rings\n\nis illustrated in figure 31.\n\n\n21\n\n\nNone of the reverse-field experiments operated so far have been\n\nsteady state, but in principle they could be made so.\n\nThe principal\n\n\ndrawbacks of this approach are that cyclotron radiation from relativistic\n\nelectrons severely limits the plasma energy density which can be con\xc2\xad\nfined by an e-layer device, and this has motivated proposalsfor using\n\nproton rings in the reverse-field configuration\n\nAdditionally, one\n\n\nmust assure the stability of the e-layer or p-layer in addition to\n\nthe confined plasma. The external equipment required to generate the\n\ne-layer or p-layer is very expensive and/or must be operated in a pulsed\n\nmanner.\n\nThe 2XII B Experiment\n\nThe 2XIIB Experiment is a principal back-up approach in the ERDA\n\nfusion program Crefso 31 and 32.).\n\nThe sequence of events in this ex\xc2\xad\n\nperiment consists of injection of plasma from Marshall type plasma guns\n\ninto a high vacuum region of relatively low magnetic field. The plasma is\n\ncompressed in a minimum-B magnetic mirror machine (refs. 31 and 32).\n\nAfter being compressed to moderately high densities, the average ion\n\nenergy is further increased by injection of several hundred equivalent\n\namperes of energetic neutral particles with energies above 10 kV.\n\nThe density is further increased by injection of neutral gas Or a\n\nweak background plasma into the confinement volume.\n\nThis device (ref. 31) has achieved confinement times of up to\n\n2 milliseconds, which is the maximum to be expected in view of particle\n\nscattering into the escape cone of this plasma. Earlier instability\n\n\n22\n\nproblems which plagued this approach (ref. 31) have been overcome.\n\nThe results attained to date with this approach have been considered\n\nsufficiently encouraging that-it may be scaled up to a much larger\n\ndevice (ref. 33) called the Tandem Mirror Reactor, in which ad\xc2\xad\nditional confinement may be achieved by trapping the plasma in an elec\xc2\xad\ntrostatic potential well.\n\nThe only other major experiments resembling\n\n\nthe general approach adopted for the 2XIIB experiments are the PR-7\n\nmachines (see ref. 34) in Russia.\n\nLaser Heated Solenoid\n\nThe laser heated solenoid is primarily a concept for heating\n\nplasma and has bee-i discussed in a review article by Kristiansen and\n\nHagler Cref. p5).\n\nThis concept consists of a very long linear pinch\n\n\nin which a sub-fusionable plasma is created by shock heating and compres\xc2\xad\nsion typical of pinch devices0\n\nIf a non-monotone radial density pro\xc2\xad\n\nfile can be produced, such that the plasma is hollow with an annular\n\nshell of higher density, it is possible to irradiate the plasma with\n\na laser along its axis in such a way that the laser radiation is refracted\n\nwithin the plasma\n0\n\nThe plasma behaves as a light pipe until the radia\xc2\xad\n\ntion is absorbed and the plasma is heated to fusion temperatures.\n\nStudies\n\n\nof this concept have shown that the length of solenoid required is on\n\n\n23\n\n\nthe order of hundreds of meters or several kilometers.\n\nThis concept\n\n\nis burdened with all the difficulties of pinch reactors (ref. 36)9\n\nincluding high capital costs, the necessity of using magnetic fields\n\nabove 10 Tesla, and the problem of storing energy for the pulsed coils\n\nof the pinch.\n\n\nThe LITE Experiment\n\nAnother concept for producing a fusion-like plasma in a mirror\n\nmachine is the LITE epxeriment (Laser Ignited Target Experiment)\n\n(ref. 37).\n\nThe magnetic field is a "baseball" minimum-B mirror geometry,\n\n\nsimilar to but smaller than the original baseball experiment at Liver\xc2\xad\nmore, the field winding of which is shown in figure 32.\n\nIn the LITE\n\n\nexperiment, it is proposed to fill a minimum-B geometry with plasmas\n\nof fusion interest by heating a small pellet of solid fuel, suspended\n\nin the center, with a laser beam,\n\nThis approach provides an alternative\n\n\nway in which plasmas of fusion interest can be heated by lasers, but its\n\nfeasibility for eventual net power producing fusion reactors is problem\xc2\xad\natical, because of the rapid particle losses associated with the minimum-\n\nB geometry, and the relatively poor efficiency of lasers as a plasma\n\nheating method0\n\nThe KAKTUS-SURMAC Concept\n\nIn the KAKTUS-SURMAC concept, magnetic dipoles are arranged around\n\nthe periphery of the intended containment volume, resulting in a cusp\xc2\xad\nlike containment geometry in which the bulk of the plasma is contained\n\nin regions of nearly zero magnetic field.\n\nThe plasma perceives a magnetic\n\n\n24\n\n\nfield which increased rapidly in strength as particles approach the\n\nwalls where magnetic dipoles are located.\n\nThe major loss in this geometry\n\n\nis along the cusps of the magnetic fields.\n\nThe concept of using multiple magnetic dipoles to confine a plasma\nin a nearly zero field region was put forward by M. Sadowski, who de\xc2\xad\nveloped the "KAKTUS" concept in the mid-1960\'s (ref. 38 and 39).\n\nThe\n\nKAKTUS device is shown in figure 33, and consists of 32 pulsed dipole\ncoils, driven by a capacitor bank, arranged over the surface of a sphere.\nThis general approach was later adopted by Leung and his associates\nat UCLA in the SURMAC concept (refs. 40 and 41).\n\nIn the SURMAC, the\n\nmultipolar magnetic fields are generated by wires or permanent magnets\narranged over the surface of the vacuum vessel in which the plasma is\nconfined., A diagram of one of the SURMAC devices with conductors wrapped\naround the containment volume is shown in figure 34.\n\nThe SURMAC concept\n\nhas been proposed as a possible fusion reactor (ief. 4\'2), based on\nscaling laws theoretically derived from a consideration of the cusp\nlosses.\n\nThe multipolar cusp configuration for a linear version of such\n\na reactor is illustrated in figure 35..\nThe KAKTUS-SURMAC concept offers the interestingpossibility of\n\nconfining a plasma in a region of low or zero magnetic field.\n\nThis\n\n\nwould avoid cyclotron radiation losses, and also minimize the capital\n\n0\ninvestment required to \'produce the confining magnetic field.\n\nAt the\n\n\npresent time, however, it is not clear that-a dense energetic Plasma\n\nof fusion interest can be\'confined in such a geometry without unacceptable\n\nlosses along the cusps 6f the magnetic\'fields.\n\n\n25\n\n\nBUMPY TORI\n\nThe Classical Bumpy Torus\n\nThe classical bumpy torus is illustrated on figure 36 and consists\n\nof a number of coils equally spaced in a toroidal array.\nof the torus consists of a magnetic mirror.\n\nEach sector\n\n\nThe particles which are\n\n\nconfined by this geometry are of two kinds: those which reflect back\n\nand forth between the magnetic mirrors in an individual sector, and\n\nthose which circulate around the major circumference of the toroidal\n\nplasma.\n\nThe magnetic field gradients along the toroidal direction\n\n\nresult in particle drift surfaces which close on themselves for both\n\ntrapped and passing particles.\n\nThis geometry represents an evolution\n\n\nof the simple mirror machine, in whic\n\nseveral magnetic mirrors are\n\n\nplaced end to end in a toroidal array to confine particles that would\n\notherwise be lost through the mirrors.\n\nThe classical bumpy torus was proposed by Gibson, Jordan, and\n\nLauer (ref. 43), who later performed an extensive series of investi\xc2\xad\ngations of single particle motion relevant to this geometry (ref. 44).\n\nSomewhat later Geller (refs. 45 and 46) operated a pulsed plasma source\n\nin a bumpy torus geometry and reported near classical confinement of the\n\nafter-glow plasma.\n\nFanchenko, et al. (ref. 47) have investigated tur\xc2\xad\n\nbulent heating in a bumpy torus plasma.\n\nThe classical bumpy torus offers a simple coil configuration,\n\nin which failed coils can be replaced relatively easily, and without\n\nhaving to be concerned about poloidal windings threading the inner\n\nbores of the toroidal field coils.\n\nThe relatively wide spacing of the\n\n\ncoils allows good access to the plasma volume for pumping, divertors,\n\nor injection and heating devices.\n\n\n26\n\nHot Electron Bumpy Torus\n\nDandl and co-workers (refs. 48 and 49) have carried out experimental\n\ninvestigations on electron cyclotron resonance heating in the Oak Ridge\n\nELMO Bumpy Torus device.\n\nThe ELMO creates a stable magnetic well in\n\n\neach sector of the torus with high beta, hot electrons which are gen\xc2\xad\nerated by absorption of RF power; the ion population i heate#y binary\n\ncollisions with the more energetic electrons,\n\nRelativistic electrons,\n\n\nwhich are generated by RF heating, are trapped near the midplane of\n\neach sector of the ELMO Bumpy Torus and produce beta values exceeding\n\n.5 in steady-state operation (refs. 48 and 49).\n\nThis provides encouraging\n\nexperimental evidence that stable, high-beta plasmas can be confined\nin the bumpy torus configuration, at least when circulating relativistic\nelectron currents are present.\n\nFigure 37 shows a cutaway diagram 6\n\n5te 2L !O Bumpy Torus Experiment, which consists of a total of 24\ncoils in a toroidal array.\n\nFigure 38 shows the vacuum magnetic field\n\nwithout the relativistic electron rings, and figure 39 shows the\n\nrerturbed magnetic field when the relativistic electron rings are\n\npresent. The direction of the magnetic field on the axis of the\n\nELMQ device is not reversed, but it sufficiently perturbed to over\xc2\xad\ncome flute and other magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that would other\xc2\xad\nwise be expected in the simple bumpy torus configuration.\n\nThe geometry\n\n\n27\n\n\nof the magnetic field windings is modular, implying an engineering ad\xc2\xad\nvantage.\n\nAn additional advantage is the demonstrated ability of the\n\n\nELMO Bumpy Torus to stably confine a high beta plasma in the steady\n\nstate.\n\nToroidal MinimumB Configurations\n\nThe stable magnetic well generated in the ELMO Bumpy Torus and\n\nillustrated on figure 39 has the disadvantage that the relativistic\n\nhot elections which generate the magnetic well must be produced by\n\nrelatively inefficient RF heating. Such hot electrons also account\n\nfor most of the plasma energy density, without contributing to fusion\n\nreactions0\n\nAn attractive way of confinia a high beta toroidal plasma\n\n\nwithout relativistic electron rings is to use a toroidally linked system\n\nof minimum-B magnetic mirrors.\n\nSuch a system of minimum-B mirrors can\n\n\nprovide magnetohydrodynamic stability with conductors located outside\n\nthe plasma volume0\n\nThis approach was examined by Cordey and Watson\n\n\n(r6fo 50) and later by Ohasa and Ikuta (ref. 51).\n\nThe approach described\n\n\nin ref. 51 is illustrated in figure 40, which shows a single coil of\n\nthe toroidally linked system,\n\nThe view shown is from the top of the\n\n\ncoil, with the dotted lines representing the portion of the-coil below,\nits equatorial plane\n0\n\nFigure 41 shows how 13 of these coils would be\n\narranged in a toroidal array.\n\nNote that the coils are rotated with\n\n28\n\n\nrespect to each other as one moves around the torus, thus giving ro\xc2\xad\ntational transform to the configuration.\n\nFigure 42 shows a magnetic\n\n\nfield plot of iso-intensity contours in the equatorial plane of the\n\ntorus, and figure 43 shows iso-intensity contours in various vertical\n\nplanes.\n\nThe toroidal minimum-B configurations described in refs. 50\n\n\nand 51 are theoretical studies.\n\nIt does not appear that this confine\xc2\xad\n\nment geometry has been jeduced to practice.\n\nThese toroidally linked minimum-B coils preserve the modular nature\n\nof the classical bumpy torus, but at a cost in increased difficulty\n\nof winding the individual coils.\n\nHowever, they do appear to offer the\n\n\npossibility of confining toroidal plasmas in the steady-state without\n\nthe penalties associated with generating relativistic hot electrons.\n\nELECTROSTATICALLY ASSISTED CONFINEMENT\n\nSince the beginning of controlled fusion research, pure magnetic\n\ncontainment, in which a plasma is confined solely by strong magnetic\n\nfields, has been the dominant approach.\n\nExternally applied electric\n\n\nfields have not thus far played a significant role in toroidal plasma\n\nconfinement.\n\nThe difficulties of principle in the way of using elec\xc2\xad\n\ntric fields for confinementwere summarized in an early paper by Post\n\n(ref. 52), who discussed the implications of Earnshaw\'s theorem. This\n\ntheorem states that a static distribution of charge, acted on only by\n\nelectric forces, cannot rest in stable equilibrium in an electric field.,\n\nIt follows from this that it is not possible to confine a plasma of\n\nfusion interest with electric fields alone.\n\nEarnshaw\'s theorem is some\xc2\xad\n\ntimes misunderstood as comp-letely ruling out the utility of externally\n\n\n29\n\n\napplied electric fields in the confinement of fusion plasmas.\n\nIt does not prohibit a distribution of charges fvom existing\n\nin dynamic equilibrium in the manner of the electrostatic containment\n\nexperiments to be described below, and it does not imply that electric\n\nfields cannot be used to enhance the confinement properties of magnetic\n\ncontainment configurations.\n\nPure Electrostatic Containment\n\nSeveral experiments have been conducted to explore the electro\xc2\xad\nstatic containment of charges of a single polarity in dynamic equili\xc2\xad\nbrium (refs. 53 to 57).\n\nThe general approach is illustrated by the\n\n\nschematic drawing in figure 44.\n\nA typical electrostatic containment\n\n\nexperiment consists of two or more spherical grids with electron or\n\nion sources located on the-outermost grid.\n\nThe inner spherical grid is\n\n\nbiased to high voltage to provide acceleration of the charged particles\n\nand to create an electrostatic potential well.. The particles are ac\xc2\xad\ncelerated along a radial direction. Upon reaching the interior of the\n\ngrids, the particles coast along a diameter of the sphere and are de\xc2\xad\ncelerated when they pass into the electric field at the opposite end\n\nof the diameter.\n\nThe radial oscillation of the charged particles will\n\n\nbe repeated until they finally intersect the grid wires and are lost.\n\nHigh localized densities near the center of such spherical geometries\n\nhave been reported (ref, 54).\n\nIt does not appear that pure electrostatic containment can com\xc2\xad\npete with other containment concepts because of electrical breakdown\n\nproblems, and also because the particles intersect the grid wires and\n\n\n30\n\n\nare lost on a relatively short time scale.\n\nIt does offer the advan\xc2\xad\n\ntage of steady-state operation, and the absence of expensive magnetic\n\nfield coils.\n\nElectrostatically Stuffed Cusps\n\nThe use of a combination of electric and magnetic fields to con\xc2\xad\nfine a plasma is implied by some early work on magnetically contained\n\narcs done at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ref. 17) and was ex\xc2\xad\nplicitly discussed in an early paper by George in 1961 (ref. 58).\n\nSeveral investigators (refs. 59-61) have applied strong electric fields\n\nto a plasma in a cusp magnetic geometry to enhance plasma confinement.\n\nIn these experiments, electrodes are placed at the throats of the mag\xc2\xad\nnetic mirrors and at the circular line cusp in the midplane.\n\nThe place\xc2\xad\n\nment of electrodes in a typical cusp experiment is illustrated in figure\n\n45, and the resulting electrostatic potential well in figure 46.\n\nElect\xc2\xad\n\nric fields are used to reflect ions and/or electrons which would other\xc2\xad\nwise be lost along the magnetic field lines.\n\nThe electrostatically\n\n\nplugged cusp geometry has been suggested as a possible approach to a\n\nfusion reactor (ref0 62).\n\nThe electrostatically stuffed cusp geometries offer the advan\xc2\xad\ntage of a magnetohydrodynamically stable magnetic configuration, in\n\nwhich the plasma sees a magnetic field which increases in all direc\xc2\xad\ntions from the center of the confinement volume.\n\nThe application of\n\n\nelectric fields has reduced losses, and increased the plasma density\n\n\n31\n\nby a factor of 10 in the KEMP II experiment (ref. 60).\n\nThis approach\n\n\nis capable of being operated in the steady state, the decreased mag=\n\nnetic field at the center of this geometry may reduce cyclotron emis\xc2\xad\nsion from the plasma and thus make advanced fuel cycles possible, and\n\nthe smaller total volume may make possible power plants with a relatively\n\nsmall total output.\n\nElectrostatically Stuffed Mirrors\n\nExternally applied electric fields have also been used to enhance\n\nthe heating and confinement of a magnetic mirror geometry (refs. 63 to 66).\n\nThese experiments do not make any provisions to suppress a possible MHD\n\ninstability of the magnetic mirror geometry. -Instead, they attempt to use\n\na series of electrodes at, or just outside the magnetic mirror throats to\n\nreflect ions and/or electrons, which would otherwise be lost along the\n\nfield lines.\n\nThis concept eliminates the line cusps at the midplane\n\n\nalong with possible losses along it.\n\nMoir et al. (ref. 63) attempted to improve only the confinement of\n\na mirror machine by an arrangement of electrodes in the mirror throats similar\n\nto that illustrated in figure 45 for the cusp geometry. The "Burnout" series\n\nof experiments at Oak Ridge used radial electric fields acting on a mirror\n\nplasma (ref 64), but their primary function was to heat the plasma rather\n\n0\nthan improve confinement.\n\nThe Burnout experiments were followed up at the\n\n\nNASA Lewis Research Center in the HIP-SUMMA series of experiments (refs.\n\n65,66).\n\nA photograph of the superconducting SUMMA magnet facility is\n\n\nshown on figure 47, and a photograph of a characteristic electrode assembly\n\nis shown in figure 48.\n\nSteady=state plasmas have been created in the SUMMA\n\n\nfacility with densities up to 101 3/cm 3 , and, under lower density operating\n\nconditions, ion kinetic temperatures up to several kilovolts have been\n\nobserved.\n\n\n31A\n\nPossible drawbacks of this approach include MHD instabilities and con\xc2\xad\nfinement of the plasma in a region of higher magnetic field than would\n\nbe the case in a cusp geometry. This latter consideration may rule out\n\nadvanced fuel cycles or operating regimes that require little or no\n\ncyclotron emission from the plasma.\n\nElectrostatically Assisted Toroidal Confinement\n\nExternally imposed electric fields have not been used to influence\n\ntoroidal confinement until recently0\n\nA theoretical paper by Kovrizhnkyh\n\n\n(ref. 67) examined the effects of an ambipolar electric field on radial\n\ntransport in tokamaks, stellarators, and bumpy tori.\nlater extended by the same author (ref, 68).\n\nThis work was\n\n\nA paper by Stix (ref. 69)\n\n\nexamined the confinement implications of ambipolar electric fields in\n\ntoroidal geometries0\n\nThe only experiment in which electric fields are deliberately applied\n\nto a toroidal plasma appears to be the Bumpy Torus experiment at the\n\nNASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio (refs. 70-72).\n\nThe\n\n\napproach taken in this experiment is characterized by three factors:\n\n1) The magnetic field and the plasma heating mechanism are operated in\n\nthe steady state, 2) Strong magnetic and electric fields are applied\n\nto the plasma, and 3) The ion kinetic temperatures are typically more\n\nthan a factor of 10 higher than the electron temperatures in this plasma.\n\nAn isometric cutaway drawing of the NASA Lewis Bumpy Torus is shown\n\nin figure 49.\n\nThe 12 superconducting magnets are shown,\n\ncan generate up to 30 kilogauss at its throat.\n\nEach magnet\n\n\nThe entire torus of\n\n\nplasma is raised to high potentials by electrode rings which surround\n\nthe plasma at the midplanes between the magnetic field coils.\n\nFigure 50\n\n\nshows a schematic drawing of the Bumpy Torus plasma and its associated\n\n\n32\n\nradial electric fieldsa\n\nThe vertical element at the center is a mid\xc2\xad\n\nplane electrode ring, which is typically operated at tens of kilovolts.\n\nThe high potentials result in strong radial electric fields between the\n\nplasma and the grounded magnet dewars.\n\nThe strong crossed electric\n\n\nand magnetic fields in the plasma volume cause drifts of ions and electrons\n\nwhich heat the ions to kinetic temperatures of kilovolts.\n\nOne interesting consequence of the application of strong external\n\nelectric fields is that the radial transport of charged particles is\n\ngreatly affected by the direction in which the radial electric field\n\npoints.\n\nSome data are shown in figure 51 for a paired comparison test\n\n\nin which the magnetic field, neutral background pressure, electrode\n\nvoltage, and electrode geometry were the same, only the plasma was\n\nbiased in the one case to positive polarities, and in the other case\n\nto negative polarities.\n\nThe plasma density and containment time is\n\n\nabout a factor of 20 higher with the negative polarities, when the\n\nelectric field pointed radially inward, than when the polarity was\n\npositive, and the electric field pointed outward from the plasma.\n\nIn the former situation, ions were "pushed into" the plasma by the\n\nelectric field, and outward in the latter0\n\nThese data illustrate quite\n\n\nclearly that the direction of the electric field has a major effect\n\non plasma containment, but it remains to sho\n\nwhether values equaling\n\n\nor exceeding classical diffusion are feasible.\n\nThe electric field serves a double function; it not only heats\n\nthe ions by E/B drift, but it also can have a very beneficial effect\n\non the plasma containment.\n\nThe basic bumpy torus magnetic field is\n\n\nmodular and allows good access to the plasma volume.\n\nOne of the po\xc2\xad\n\ntential engineering drawbacks is the presence of the midplane electrode\n\nrings, shown in figure 50, which are required to bias the torus of\n\n\n33\n\nplasma to high potentials.\n\nWhether or not such water-cooled electrode\n\n\nrings can be maintained in the vicinity of a fusion plasma remains to\n\nbe seen.\n\n\n34\n\n\nMISCELLANEOUS APPROACHES\n\nThe Migma Concept\n\nThe migma concept for coftrolled fusion represents a combination\n\nof three ideas: the cdlliding beam storage ring concept from high energy\n\nnuclear physics, the organized motions found in magnetrons and triode\n\nvacuum tubes, and the energetic neutral injection concept from mirror\n\nmachine research.\n\nThis concept has been conceived and promoted by B.C.\n\n\nMaglich and his co-workers (refs. 7 3-7 ). The essence of this concept\n\n5\nis illustrated on figurc 52.\n\nEnergetic neutrals are injected into a\n\n\nmagnetic field and ionized in such a way that they gyrate in circles\n\nshown in figure 52A.\n\n\'thesegyrating particles can be made to precess\n\n\nabout the magnetic axis as is illusjttd in figur, 52B.\n\nOnce a large\n\n\nnumber of particles are accumulated and gyrating around the magnetic\n\naxis, the situation illustrated in figures 52C\n\ntnd D will result.\n\n\nMany of the particle orbits which intersect the axis will result in\n\nhead-on collisions between individual charged particles and these can\n\nproduce a large number of fusion reactions in a small volume near the\n\nmagnetic axis, as illustrated in figure 51D.\n\nMeV particle energies\n\n\nare required in order to make the fusion cross section large compared\n\nto the elastic scattering cross section.\npossible\n\nMore complicated orbits are\n\nin which particles can be made\n\n\nto gyrate and drift in such a way that the intersection of their orbits\n\noccurs in several locations in the plasma volume. Figure 53\n\nshows a photograph of the migma experiment, in which the superconducting\n\nmagnets which produce the uniform field of this device are shown.\n\n\nIf the migma concept works as is intended, fusion reactions will\n\noccur in a relatively small volume where the colliding orbits are con\xc2\xad\ncentrated, and the total power output will be relatively small.\n\nIt\n\n\nremains to be shown that a plasma of sufficiently high density can\n\nbuild up without disrupting the particle orbits and preventing the\n\nformation of regions of intersecting orbits.\n\nIt also remains to be\n\n\nshown that the migma plasma can build up to densities higher than those\n\nachieved in neutral injection experiments, which were limited by plasma\n\ninstabilities.\n\nIt is clear that the migma concept will require a large\n\n\namount of circulating power to provide the energetic charged particles\n\nwith more than an MeV of energy, and this may not,be possible with high\n\nefficiency.\n\n\nThe Wall-Confined Plasma\n\nIt has been suggested that a reacting fusion plasma be confined\n\nby gasdynamic boundary layers alone, or by such boundary layers in\n\nconjunction with magnetic fields.\n\nThis suggestion appears to have\n\n\nbeen first made by Tsien in 1956 (ref. 76), who developed an analogy\n\nbetween a fusion reactor and a chemical rocket engine, and concluded\n\nthat it may be possible to confine a fusion reaction with gasdynamic\n\nboundary layers.\n\nA similar concept was put forward by Alfven and Smars\n\n\n(ref. 77), who proposed to shield a steady-state magnetically-confined\n\nplasma by a layer of neutral gas near the wall, making use of the lower\n\nthermal conductivity of the neutral gas relative to that of the ionized,\n\ncentral core.\n\nGross (ref. 78) has proposed a pulsed concept, in which\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\n36\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\na plasma is heated to densities and temperatures of thermonuclear interest\n\nin a shock-tube, and then confined by a suddenly imposed magnetic bar\xc2\xad\nrier which retards the dissipation of this gas\nconcept is shown in figure 54.\n\nThe essence of this\n\n\nThe shock wave propagates from left\n\n\nto right, reflecting off the end of the shock tube qn the right.\nthe passage of the shock wave,\n\nAfter\n\n\nthe heated gas at the right hand side\n\nof the shock tube is confined by a "magnetic dam" which is generated\nby a pulsed coil with a fast rise time.\n\nPhe magnetic and plasma energy\n\ndensitiqs associated with this concept are illustvated on figure 55\nIt\n\nis unclear whether any of these concepts could be capable of pro\xc2\xad\n\nducing a plasma of fusion interest for a signhficant length of time.\n\nSUIMARY\nAn attempt has been made in \'lable IV to 5ummarize the advantages\nand disadvantages of the alternative confinement concepts covered in\nthis survey.\n\nIt\n\nis\n\ntoo early to state which,\n\nif\n\nany, of the advanced\n\nconcepts described in this table will be feasible or will find their\nway into the mainstream of fusion research.\n\nMany of these concepts\n\nhave one or more attributes which make them a potential improvement over\nthe tokamak concept, in terms of environmental acceptability or of cap\xc2\xad\nital and resource productivity.\n\nFurther research on these concepts\n\n\nmay reveal difficulties not listed in this table or might overcome some\n\nof the disadvantages listec\n\nOne should guard against any tendency to\n\n\nconsider all approaches listed on Table IV as equally feasible or equally\n\nplausible alternatives to the tokamak.\n\nMost have little or no data base,\n\n\nin contrast to the very great depth of the experimental and theoretical\n\neffort on the tokamak concept.\n\nTo give a crude indication of this factor,\n\n\n37\n\nthree additional rows have been added at the bottom of Table IV.\n\nThe first\n\n\n.row on the bottom of Table III indicates the concepts which have been re\xc2\xad\nduced to practice in the form of operating experimental apparatus.\n\nThe second\n\n\nrow indicates the approaches for which the scaling laws of the Lawson\n\nparameters are reasonably well known, and the last row lists those approaches\n\nfor which density, ion temperature, and containment time have been measured0\n\nTable V lists the plasma parameters of some of the experimental\n\ndevices based upon the concepts listed in Table IV.\n\nInsufficient data\n\n\nare available from the literature to list entries for many of the de\xc2\xad\nvices known to be operational.\n\nFigure 56 is the Lawson diagram for the\n\n\nalternative approaches listed in Table V. In most cases shown on Table IV\n\nand Figure 56, simultaneous-values of n, t-, and Ti were not available,\n\nand it was not clear whether the particle or energy containment time was\n\nbeing quoted.\n\nComparison of this with figure 2, the Lawson diagram for\n\n\ntokanak experiments, shows that many of the alternative approaches have\n\nto advance pore than two orders of magnitude in the parameter nT before\n\nthey can be considered competitive with the larger and much better funded\n\ntokamak experiments.\n\n\nTABLE V\nPLASMA PARAMETERS OF ALTERNATIVE DEVICES\n\nDEVICE AND TYPE\nKEMP II Electrostat ically\nPlugged Cusp\nforso Torsatron\n\nTe,eV\n\nTi,eV\n\nnemax\n\nTC, msec\n\nno Tc\n\n\n11\n4x10\n\n1000\n200 \n\n\n1013 \t\n\n-\n\n0.5\n\n20\n\n0 3\n\n3N10 9\n\nColumbia High Energy\nShock \'lube\n\nTormac\n2XIIB Pulsed Mirror\n\n100\n\n1000 \t\n\n10 eV\n\n350\n\n\n250\n\nLewis Bumpy Torus\n\n10 eV\n\nELMO Bumpy Torus\n\n1016\n\n2x10 1 5\n\n0.1\n\n2x-1011\n\n13,000\n\n3.5x1O13\n\n2 0\n\n7\\1010\n\n200-400\n\n6.2xi01 2\n\n2.5\n\n1.6xi0 1 0\n\n130\n\n2.0x10 12\n\n20\n\n4x101 0\n\n2x1O 1 2\n\n1.5\n\n3\\10\n\n100\n\nProto-Cleo\nStollarator\n\n10 eV\n\nSirius Stellarator\n\n1000\n\nUragan Stellarator\n\n300\n\n400 \t\n\n70\n\n400 \n\n\nC - Stellarator\n\n\xc2\xad\n\n10 eV\n-\n\n1013\n\nORIGINAL PAGE I$\n\nOp POOR QUAI=r\n\n\n9\n1.0\n\n1010\n\n1\n2x10\n 2\n\n0 6\n\n1 2\\109\n\n2x1013\n\n1.0\n\n2>1010\n\n\n39\n\nIf it were possible to generate fusion-electric power with 1/10\n\nthe amount of capital or resources of competitive approaches, there\n\nwould obviously be an even greater motivation to develop fusion power\n\nplants than now exists,\n\nSuch a situation may be possible for fusion\n\n\npower plants using advanced fuel cycles, and the possiblity has already\n\nbeen shown to exist in the area of space propulsion (ref 3), where fusion\n\npropulsion can make possible missions which otherwise could not be\n\naccomplished at all.\n\nDesign studies of eleatrical generating plants based on the DT\n\nTokamak reactor have been encouraging in that they have shown that\n\nsuch a power plant may be feasible, but they have been somewhat dis\xc2\xad\ncouraging in that they have indicated such power plants will not have\n\na capital cost lower than existing alternative power plants (refs. 4,\n\n6, and 7),\n\nUntil the present time, the focus of fusion research has\n\n\nbeen on whether fusion reactors are feasible at all.\n\nIn the future,\n\n\nanswering the question of feasiblity will not be sufficient.\n\nThose\n\n\nof us in the fusion community must be able to show, in addition, that its\n\ncapital and resource productivity, as well as its environmental accepta\xc2\xad\nbility, are at least as good as alternative energysources.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe author would like to thank H.
