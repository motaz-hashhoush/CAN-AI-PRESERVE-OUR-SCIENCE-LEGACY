The scientific payload was selected to perform studies in upper atmospheric physics and infrared astronomy with principal investigators from France, the Netherlands, England, and several groups from the United States. Communication links between the 'Spacelab' and a ground based mission operations center were limited consistent with Spacelab plans. The mission was successful and provided extensive data relevant to Spacelab objectives on overall management of a complex international payload; experiment preparation, testing, and integration; training for proxy operation in space; data handling; multiexperimenter use of common experimenter facilities (telescopes); multiexperiment operation by experiment operators; selection criteria for Spacelab experiment operators; and schedule requirements to prepare for such a Spacelab mission.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760006048, "id": "5f6ba4be69ef4c53a469fd10d0b3d150", "publicationDate": "1975-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760006048.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760006048/downloads/19760006048.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760006048/downloads/19760006048.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760006048/downloads/19760006048.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
