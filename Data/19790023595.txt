A prototype web-dendritic growth machine, on\nhand at the beginning of the contract, was assembled and activated. A program for investigating the role of the various machine design parameters on\nthe growth of web-dendritic ribbon was carried out during the duration of\nthe cant; ,act. The development of the machine proceeded to the point where\nribbons could be reproducibly grown up to lengths of l meter, with widths\nincreasing linearly from a minimum, at the initiating seed button, up to\n1 cm. at the point of termination of growth.\nConsiderable thermal data was collected and evaluations were made of actual\nseeding and growth for variations in a large number of parameters affecting\nheat loss. From this we found for achieving suitable growth that the\nmechanical system should be very rigid and stable, and`-nie tolerances and\nspecifications of the quartz crucibles must be far tighterthan\' rzrl-\xc2\xb0---^r"\'\ne\nquartz tolerances. The widening rates of the ribbons were found to be a\nfunction of the temperature gradient rather than the temperature differences\nalone. A twin spacing in the seed of 3p - 2p was found to be unfavorable\nfor growth; whereas spacing of .9p - 2p and 8p - 2 p were favorable. It was\nfound, however, that the spacing of 8p - 2p sets an upper limit of 4 cm/min\non the maximum achievable rate.\nExtensive thermal modeling studies were carried out to investigate the\neffect of furnace design parameters on the temperature distributions in\nmelt and the growth of the dendritic-web ribbon. From this study it was\nfound that the pull rate of the ribbon is strongly dependent on the temperature of the top thermal shield, the spacing between this shield and the melt,\nand the thickness of the growing web.\n\niii\n\ny^\n\n4\n\nFINAL REPOkT - TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nNo.\n\n\t\n\nPage\n\t\n\nCOVER PAGE\n\ni\n\t\n\nii\n\nTECHNICAL CONTENT STATEMENT - NEW TECHNOLOGY STATEMENT\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\t\n\niii\n\nABSTRACT\n\t\n\niv\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLIST OF FIGURES\nLIST OF TABLES\n\n\t\n\nvi\n\n\t\n\nx\n\nABBREVIATIONS USED\n\n\t\n\nxi i\n\n\t\nI.

Thermal Modeling of Web growth\nThe primary objectives of this part of the project were:\n(1) To develop a mathematical model of the web-dendritic growth to\npredict the furnace design parameters which effect the growth\nof the web.\n(2) To develop a mathematical model to predict the temperature\ndistribution in the melt, crucible, susceptor and thermal\nshield. The model will be used to determine the effect of\nslot geometry and susceptor geometry on the temperature distribution in the melt.\n\n2\n\nApproach\nObjective (1) was met by the development of a one-dimensional heat transfer\nmodel of the web and meniscus. The rate of heat transport of the latent\nheat of crystallization from the liquid- solid -interface of the web determines\nthe rate of growth. Neat is transported in the web and meniscus by conduction\nand convection; heat is exchanged at the surfaces with the environment by\nradiation and convection.\nMeniscus geometry was calculated and the effect of joining angle on the\nmeniscus height and shape were determined.\nRadiation heat transfer between the thermal shield and web was included\nin the model. The angle factor between the thermal shield and web was\ndetermined.\nTo meet objective (2) a finite difference heat transfer model was developed\nfor the melt, susceptor, crucible, and thermal shield. Convection was\nneglected in the melt -thus heat is transferred in the melt by conduction.\nNeat transfer in the quartz crucible is by radiation and convection. Radiation accounts for the most of the heat transfer at the surfaces. Neat\ntransfer between the melt surface and the thermal shield is primarily due to\nradiation.\nBecause of the rectangular slot geometry, heat transfer in non-axiosymmetric\nthus a three dimensional heat transfer model was required.\nAnalysis of the effect of the radiation ports in the susceptor requires the\nuse of a three-dimensional heat transfer model.\n\n2. INTRODUCTION\nAt the time of initiation of this project, fall 1975, the "millstone-around-the neck" of the solar cell industry was the high cost of production of solar\ncells. This kept the fairly well developed space technology from being given\nserious application to meet terrestiral energy needs of the world. With the\nrecent awareness by the general public of the inevitably limited supply of\ncheap fossil fuels, it became apparent that an investigation should be made\ninto the feasibility of making commercially competitive solar cells.\nA considerable portion of the cost of producing the conventional silicon\nsolar cells is tied up in the production of the single crystal silicon in sheet\nform for use in fabricating the cells. The standard process for producing the\nsheet silicon for solar cells used for spare applications was to slice wafers\nfrom ingots grown by the Czochralski process and then laboriously prepare the\nsliced wafers by polishing and etching until they had the required surface\nperfection to be suitable for use. An alternate process for producing silicon\nin sheet form had been invented at the Westinghouse Corporation in 1965 which\nappeared to show some promise in reducing the cost of producing the silicon\nsheet. This process was called the Web-dendritic process and it produced\nflat crystalline ribbons approximately 2 cros. wide and up to several meters\nin length, having acceptably perfect flat polished surfaces as grown. It\nwas felt that the elimination of the process steps necessary for preparing\nthe surfaces of solar cell wafers from the Czochralski grown crystals, would\n\n3\nresult in a considerable reduction in the cost of solar cells. Relatively\nlittle was known, outside of Westinghouse, of the web process and in fact\nit had been abandoned by Westinghouse also. No growth facilities existed\nin operating condition in 1975.\nIt was in response to the obvious need that the University of South Carolina\nprepared the work reported hereinto the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which\nhad been given the prime contract to develop silicon solar cells for terrestrial applications.\nIt was proposed that a growth facility already existing on the campus be\nactivated and used to investigate the feasibility of producing sheet silicon\nby the web-dendritic process of adequate quality for solar cell purposes at\na cost which would make solar cells commercially competitive energy sources.\nThe program was broken up into two distinct yet mutually supporting areas of\nresearch, namely: the growth of web-dendritic ribbon and the computer modeling\nof the growth system and process for the development of improved, less costly\ngrowth facilities having improved throughout. The following pages constitute\nthe report on the results of this investigation which ran from October 1975 to\nSeptember 1977.\n\n11\n\n4\n\nr\n\n3. THEORETICAL THERMAL ANALYSIS\n3.1. Thermal Modeling of Ribbon\n\nSolidification\n\n3.1.1 Introduction\nThis investigation focuses on the heat transport in the web and meniscus\nduring the growth of silicon ribbon (see Figure 1). Previous experimental\nthe web-dendritic ribbon\nstudies indicate that the maximum pull rate\ngrowth is limited by the web rather than the edge dendrites. Single silicon\ndendrites have been grown at rates of approixmately 20 cm/min while silicon\nweb-dendritic ribbon growth rates are normally less than 5 cm/min. There\ndoes not appear to be any reason that the two edge dendrites cannot grow as\nrapidly as s;:-igle dendrites. Thus, it is concluded that the web-dendritic\nribbon growth is limited by the solidification rate of the web. The rate\nof heat transport of the latent heat. of crystallization from the liquidsolid interface of the web determines the rate at which the ribbon grows.\nHeat is transported in the web and meniscus by conduction and convection;\nheat is exchanged at the surfaces with the environment by radiation and\nconvection.\n\nof\n\nAn analytical model of the web growth is developed and numerical results are\npresented for the growth of silicon ribbon. The furnace design as well as\nmeniscus and web geometry are shown to determine the maximum attainable pull\nrate. parameters that are of most importance are the web thickness, meniscus\njoining angle, thermal shield temperature, and the spacing between the thermal\nshield and melt surface.\n\nk\t\n\n1\nV\n\nPULL\nf \'\n\n01\n\nDENDRITIC SEED\n,--- BUTTON\n\nEDGE DENDRITES\nWEB\n\nTHICKNESS\n\nMENISCUS\n\nLIQUID SILICON\nFigure 1. Sketch of web-dendritic ribbon growth geometry.\n\nb\n3.1.2. Meat Transport in the Meniscus and Web\nThe transport of heat in the region of the liquid-solid interface determines the rate at which latent heat of crystallization is removed from\nthe liquid-solid interface. Figure 2 shows the cross--section of the\nmeniscus, web, and thermal shield of a web dendritic ribbon growth furnace.\nThe web is withdrawn through a slot in the molybdenum thermal shield cover,\ning Oe melt. The melt is contained in a fused quartz crucible which is\nfitted into a molybdenum susceptor. meat is supplied to the furnace by\ninduction heating the molybdenum susceptor by an r.f. field.\nThe purpose of the thermal shield is to reduce heat losses from the upper\nmelt surface so that temperature gradients within the melt can be minimized.\nBecause of radiation from the thermal shield, the shield assists in obtaining the correct temperature gradient in the web.\nThe temperature gradient along the Iength (or z-direction ) shown in Figure 2\nis of primary importance. Since web width greater than approximately 5 cm\nare of commercial importance, temperature variation across the width will be\nsmall compared to that in the z-direction. Temperature variations across\nthe thickness is also small since the web thickness is usually in the range\nof 0.1 to 0.2 mm. At the base of the meniscus, the thickness increases\nsignificantly but since temperature gradients are small \'in that region, the\ntwo-dimensional heat conduction is insignificant. Consequently, one-dimensional\nsteady-state heat transport can be assumed in the web and meniscus. Because\nthe web and meniscus melt are moving in the z-direction, both convective and\nconduction transport mechanisms are present. The material is opaque, therefore,\nradiation in the solid and liquid can be neglected. Convective and radiation\nheat exchange with the surrounding environment occurs at the surfaces of the\nweb.\n\nHarrill [2] derived the governing differential equation for the temperature\nvariation in web and meniscus. The differential equation for the meniscus\ndiffers slightly from that of the web because the variation of meniscus\nthickness is a function of z. The temperature variation in the web is given\nby,\n\n2\n\n\tV\ndT\t _\t\npsC\n^ ^ ks p dz\nd T\t\n\nd\n\n2h\n\nksts (T-T a\n\n2 W) -- --\tks a H _ 0\n^--^\n\nThe symbols used in Equation (1) are as follows:\nT\np\nCp\nh\nV\n\n- Temperature\n- density\n-- specific heat\n- surface convective heat transfer coefficient\n- ribbon pull rate\n\nk - thermal conductivity coefficient\n\nt - thickness\nW - emissive power of surface\nH - total irradiation of surface\na - radiation absorption coefficient\n\n(1)\n\n\t\n\nr..\n7\n\n9i\n\nV\n\nis\nWEB\nTHERMAL SHIELD\n\nLIQUiD-SOLID INTERFACE\n\ns\n\t\n\nMENISCUS\n\ntM\n\n1\n\t\n\nFigure 2. \t\n\nMELT\n\nCross-section of furnace showing melt, meniscus, web\nand thermal shield.\n\n0\t\n\n8\t\n\nSubscripts:\n\na - atmosphere\n\ns - sol -id\nThe first term of equation (1) accounts for heat conduction in the web.\nConstant thermal conductivity is assumed since calculations performed to\ndetermine the effect of thermal conductivity variation with temperature,\nhave indicated that the assumption of a constant conductivity introduced\nan error of less than 5 percent [2].\nThe second and third terms of equation (1) are the convective transport\nof the web which results from web motion and the convective exchange with\nthe surrounding environment (argon) respectively. The last term is the\nradiation exchange at the surface of the web. The surface emission, W,\ngiven by\n\nW = caT\n\n4\n\n\t\n(2)\n\nwhere c and a are the emissivity of the surface and Stefan-Boltzmann constant, respectively. The radiation absorbed from the surroundings is the\ntotal irradiation H multiplied by the absorptance a. The surfaces are\nassumed gray; therefore, a and c are equal.\nThe governing differential equation for the temperature in the meniscus\nis [31,\n\n2\nd T\t\n\n_L dt\t\n\ndz 2\t\n\nt\n\n\t\n\n^ts y\tdT\t\n^s C\nk\n\ndz\t\n\nt \t\nm m\n\n2h (T--Ta)\n\ndz - kmtm\n\n- 2 W-aH = 0\nkmtm\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the subscript, m, refers to the melt. Note that equation (1) and\n(3) are identical except for the second term. The first term in the\nparenthesis is the additional conduction term for a variable meniscus\nthickness, t . The velocity of the melt in the meniscus is also a function\nof z and has been factored into the second term in the parenthesis by using\nthe mass conservation principle.\n\nm\n\nLatent heat of crystallization is released at the liquid-solid interface.\nAssuming that the temperature is continuous across the liquid-solid interface, the latent heat is conducted into the meniscus and web.

In this case, there are three temperatures that are\nmaintained; first the temperature at the base of the meniscus is equal to\nthe crucible melt temperature. Since the growing tips of the dendrites are\nsubmerged, the melt entering the base of the meniscus is supercooled.\nA second boundary condition is at the liquid--solid interface. Because the\nweb solidifies in a mechanism similar to Czochralski growth, the temperature\nof the liquid-solid interface is at the silicon melting temperature. The\nthird boundary condition is above the thermal shield where the temperature\nof the web approaches equilibrium with the surrounding furnace atmosphere\nat a large distance from the thermal shield. The temperature gradient in\nthe z--direction becomes negligible and the first and second terms of\nequation (1) can be neglected yielding,\nh (T--Ta ) + W -\n\naH\n\n= 0\t\n\n(5)\n\nEquation (5) then i s used to determine the equilibrium temperature on the\nweb at a distance above the thermal shield.\nBecause equations (1) and (3) are second order, only two of the boundary\nconditions are normally needed to obtain a unique solution. However, the\ndifferential equations contain unknown parameters V, t , and t whose values\nmust be choosen specifically to satisfy the third boundary co4ition. For\na given meniscus and web geometry, the boundary conditions can be satisfied\nfor only a particular V. Thus, one boundary condition determines unknown\nparmeters contained in the differential equation.\n3.1.3. Heat Transfer at the Web and Meniscus Surface\nThe convective heat transfer coefficient h on the surface of the meniscus\nand web results from the cooling effect of the surrounding argon. The flow\nrate of the argon is small; so that the flow of the argon on the surfaces is\nprimarily due to either bouyancy or natural convection. Thus h was determined\nassuming natural convection from a vertical surface [2] and is 3.45 W/m.oC.\nThe magnitude of the convective heat transfer from the surface is found to be\nmuch less than radiation and could be neglected without significant error.\nThe net radiation heat transfer at the surface is the difference between\nemission W and absorption H. Because W is described by equation (2), at\nthis point we need only discuss H. In the region below the thermal shield,\nthe meniscus and web are irradiated by the horizontal melt surface and the\nbottom surface of the thermal shield as seen in Figure 2. The radiation\nreceived from each surface is determined by the radiation leaving the\nsurface and the angle factor. Below the thermal shield Harrill [2] showed that\n\n1! = l + 6 1 - 1,l\t\n2(\' +\t\n\nf l4(2\t\n_ ^ 2\t\n\n!\t\n\nT24 (e - l )\t\n1\n\n(6)\n\nwhere surface (1) and (2) are the thermal shield and horizontal melt surfaces,\nrespectively.\n\n^i\n\n10\n\nThe web surface extending above the thermal shield is irradiated primarily\nfrom the upper surface of the thermal shield since the temperature of the\nsurrounding surfaces is relatively low. The magnitude of H is thus greatly\nreduced at the thermal shield because there is no contribution from the\nmelt surface. In addition H reduces with distance above the thermal shield\ndue to the reduction in angle factor between the thermal shield surface\nand the web surface. An expression for H is derived in Appendix I and is\ngiven by\n4\nE 1 Ti\t\n-\t\nZR + tan -1 (R\t\nH =\n(7)\n\nx\n\n+R\n\nwhere x is the distance from the thermal shield surface to an element of\narea on the web and R is the radius of the thermal shield. It is seen\nthat x = z -(s-h o ). The subscript (1) in equation (7) refers to the thermal\n\nshield.\n\n3.1.4. Meniscus Geometry\nThe thickness of the meniscus tm and meniscus height needed in equation (3)\nare determined by the meniscus geometry. Because the width of the web is\nlarge relative to the height, the meniscus is two-dimensional. Batchelor\n[31 presents the solution to the Euler--Laplace equation for the meniscus\non an infinite flat plate which is also applicable to the present problem.\nThe meniscus is attached to a solid web as shown in Figure 3.\t\nThe joining\nangle is the angle between the meniscus surface and the vertical axis at the\njuncture of the meniscus with the solid web. In Figure 3, the web thickness is shown uniform so that the web surface is vertical. If web thickness\nis increasing or decreasing, the web surface is no longer vertical. Negative values of a are to the left of the vertical axis and positive values\nare to the right. Neglecting dynamic effects, meniscus height h o [3] is\ngiven by\nho = K\t\n\n2 1-sin\xc2\xa9\t\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nK = f / p m 9\t\n\n(9)\n\nand y is the surface tension, p is density and g acceleration of gravity.\nIn equation (8) it is seen thatmmeniscus height decreases while a increases.\nThe meniscus is given by\n\n2K\n-cosh -1\ny /K = cosh-1\nz\t\n\nK\n2\n\no\t\n\n+\n\n(4 -\n\nh2\n/ 1 2 -\n\nK\t\n\nZ )\n1/2\t\n(4 --\n\n(10)\n\nK\n\nwhere y and z^ are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the meniscus\nsurface with the origin located as shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 4 shows silicon menisci joining angles of -10 0 , 0 0 , 10\xc2\xb0 that were\ndetermined using equations (8) through (10). Silicon properties used in\nthe calculations are contained in Table 1 and the acceleration of gravity\nis 980 cm/sec .

As 6 increases, the meniscus thickness increases and h o is decreased.\n3.1.5. numerical Results for the Growth of Silicon Ribbon\nNumerical results for the heat transfer model were obtained for the growth\nof silicon ribbon. Thermophysical properties of silicon used in the\nanalysis are contained in Table 1. Integration of the differential equations was carried out using the IBM CSMP3 (Continuous System Modeling\nProgram III) [4] on an IBM 370 computer. A variable-step Runge-Kutta integration routine was used which varied the step size to maintain accuracy\nof the numerical integrations. Provision for including functional relations\nsuch as tm and H are built into the CSMP3 program and greatly simplify\nproblem input. The thermal shield radius R in equation (7) was assumed\nequal to 5.0 cm and its temperature is assumed uniform. An emissivity of\n0.37 was assumed for both the top and bottom surfaces of the thermal\nshield [5].\nFigures 5 and 6 show the temperatures calculated in the meniscus and web\nrespectively for web thicknesses of 0.10 mm and 0.20 mm web thickness. A\nthermal shield temperature T 1 of 1300% was chooses and the spacing between\nthe thermal shield and melt surface is 1.0 cm. These are representative\nvalues for current furnace experiments. The effect of these variables on\nthe growth characteristics is discussed later.\nExperimental measurements performed by Surek and Chalmers [6] indicates\nthat the web of uniform thickness is obtained for e - I1\xc2\xb0. At larger values\nthe web increases in thickness while at smaller values the thickness decreases.\nIn Figure 5 and 6 a joining angle of 1I 0 is assumed. As mentioned earlier\nthe liquid--solid interface is at the melting temperature which is approximately 1412\xc2\xb0C for silicon. It was assumed that the melt is supercooled 5\xc2\xb0C,\nthus the temperature of the meniscus is 1407\xc2\xb0C. In Figure 5 the base of\nthe meniscus is at the crucible melt temperature of 1407\xc2\xb0C and the liquidsolid interface is at 1412\xc2\xb0C. It is seen that the minimum temperature is\nreached when the meniscus temperature is slightly lower than that at the\nbase as a result of heat losses from the meniscus surface. Heat is conducted from both the crucible melt and the liquid-solid interface and radiated\nby the meniscus surface.\nFigure 6 shows the web temperature as a function of distance from the\nliquid-solid interface. The sharp decrease in temperature results from the\nlower thermal conductivity of the web in comparison to the melt in the\nmeniscus (Table I). Because the thermal shield is approximately 0.3 cm\nabove the liquid-solid interface a slight increase in the slope of the curves\nis observed at that position. This increase is the result of the decrease\nin H at the thermal shield as shown in Figure 7. The large decrease in H\nshown in Figure 6 at 1.0 cm from the melt surface is the position of the\nthermal shield.\n\nn\t\n\n,\n15\n\n1415\nLIQUID-SOLID\nINTERFACE\n\t\noc ,\nw\nd\n\n1410\nw\nF-\n\nU\ntI?\nZ\nW\n\n140\n\n0.0\t\n\n0.6\t\n0.4\t\n0.2-\t\nDISTANCE ABOVE MELT SURFACE,CM\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 5.

Irradiation H of meniscus and web surface. Thermal\nshield is 1.0 cm from melt and has a temperature of\n1300\xc2\xb0C.\n\n3...1\n\n18\n\nThe effect of a on the calculated pull rate is shown, Figure 8, for web\n\nthicknesses of 0.10 mm, 0.15 mm, and 0.20 mm. It is seen that the pull\nrate is greater for the thinner web and the pull rate is also higher for\nsmaller 0. The higher pull rate is due to the greater meniscus height\nwhich results in a larger surface area for radiating heat. When 0 becomes\nnegative, necking occurs in the meniscus and causes a decrease in the thermal\nconductance of latent heat from the liquid--solid interface. In Figure 8\nit is seen that the maximum pull rate occurs at approximately e = -5\xc2\xb0 and\nsmaller values of 0 have a lower pull rate. Values of S and T 1 are 1.0 cm\nand 1300\xc2\xb0C, respectively.\nAssuming a uniform web thickness is obtained at e ^ 11\xc2\xb0, Figure 8 predicts\npull rates of approximately 3.6, 4.0, and 4.5 cm/min for web thicknesses of\n0.20, 0.15, and 0.10 mm web thicknesses respectively. It appears that the\ngrowth is stable because equilibrium conditions are restored after perter-bating the pull rate. If the pull rate is suddenly increased after equilibrium\nconditions have been established, e will decrease along the constant web\nthickness curve to the increased velocity. It is seen in Figure 7 that\n0 is now smaller than for uniform Li eb thickness; the web thickness grows\nthinner and at the same time a increases. When 0 reaches ll\xc2\xb0, equilibrium\nconditions are restored at faster pull rate and thinner web thickness.\nExtreme changes in pull rate, however, can lead to growth failure. A large\nincrease in pull rate will cause separation of the web from the melt. For\nexample, Figure 8, if the web is initially being pulled at a uniform web\nthickness of 0.15 mm and pull rate is increased from the pull rate of 4.0\nto a value greater than approximately 4.3 cm/min, separation occurs since\ne cannot be decreased sufficiently to obtain a higher pull rate at the\n0.15 mm thickness. Large decreases in the pull rate may lead to melt wetting\nof the side of the web, causing additional dendrites, or "thirds", to initiate\nin the web region. This would render the web useless from an economic standpoint.\nThe results presented in Figure 8 are for a thermal shield temperature of\n1300\xc2\xb0C and a spacing between the thermal shield and melt surface of 1.0 cm.\nThe thermal shield temperature can be varied in the furnace by raising or\nlowering the induction coils. Although the optimum thermal shield temperature has not been established, the effect of its temperature on the pull\nrate was determined and results are shown in Figure 9 . As expected, the\npull rate decreases as the thermal shield temperature increases. Increasing\nthe thermal shield temperature from 1300% to 1350\xc2\xb0C results in a decrease\nin the pull rate of approximately 10 percent. Since the thermal shield\ntemperature has a significant effect on pull rate, it is important to design\nthe furnace for operation at the minimum possible thermal shield temperatures.\nIn Figure 10 it is seen that the pull rate is highest for the smallest\nspacing between the thermal shield and the melt surface. Since H is greater\nfor the web and the meniscus surface under the thermal shield, minimizing\nthis space reduces the total irradiation. If the web and meniscus surface\nreceive less radiation from the surroundings, net heat loss to the surroundings is increased. Consequently the latent heat is more rapidly lost\nfrom the interface so that pull rate can be increased.\n\nI\n\n20\n\n^-\n\n^ A n \xe2\x96\xbaA\n\nf\t\n\n1,-% l ILA\n\n.L-^ I C \xe2\x96\xba A l\n\n15\n\nc^\nw\n0\nLS 10\nz\ni\n\n^j\t\nr\n\nz\n\n5\n\na\n\n0\n\n-5"\n"\n3.5\n\n4.0\t\n\n4.5\n\nPULL RA T E, CM/M I N\n\nFigure 8.

By continuously replinishing the silicon in the crucible to maintain a constant level, the pull rate can be maintained constant.\n3.1.6. Discussion\nAn analytical model of the web-dendritic ribbon growth was developed and\nnumerical results were obtained using the model for silicon. The furnace\ndesign at the University of South Carolina was used in the study. Detailed\ncomparisons of the analytical results with experimental data were not performed since experimental data of sufficient detail to make these comparisons\nwas not available. however, general agreement has been obtained with experimental results. For example, pull rates are generally in the range from\n3-5 cm/min as is expected from the analytical predictions.\nThe furnace parameters that have the greatest effect on the pull rate have\nbeen identified. To improve pull rates appreciably will require modification of furnace design to increase the heat losses from the web and\nmeniscus surface in the region of the liquid-solid interface.\nThe physical properties used in the numerical calculation are contained in Tables 1 and 2. Measurements contained in the literature\ndiffer widely and therefore some judgement must be exercised in\nchoosing the properties. This is particularly true of the emissivity\nof solid silicon where values as high as 0.6 have been measured. Increased\nr.missivity values of the web will result in higher pull rates. Thus the\ncurves. presented in Figure 8 - I0 will be shifted to the right. However,\na higher molybdenum emissivity than that listed in Table 2 will result in\na lower pull rate due to the increased radiation transport to the meniscus\nand web. A parametric study would be needed to determine the effect of\nthese parameters on predicted results. However, the maximum effect is not\nexpected to exceed approximately 10/.\n\n3.2 Furnace Temperature Analysis\n3.2.1. Introduction\nThe furnace temperature distribution was investigated using LION-4 [1] which\nis a finite difference thermal program. The program is capable of solving\nthree--dimensional conduction steady and non-steady heat transfer problems\nwith convection and radiation boundary conditions. The effect of furnace\ndesign parameters such as susceptor geometry, slot geometry and radiation\nports on the steady state temperature was investigated.\nTemperature distributions were calculated for the two susceptor designs\nused in the experimental growth and studies, Figures 11 and 12. Calculations were performed for the tapered susceptor with and without the\nradiation ports in order to determine the effect of-the ports on the melt\ntemperature distribution.\n\ns\n23\n\nTable 2.

Straight sided (SS)\'susceptor.\n\n26\n\nBecause heat radiated by the melt escapes through the slot, the temperature\nof the melt in the region of the slot is effected by the slot geometry.\nRibbon growth occurs in the region of the melt slot, therefore, geometry\naffects the growth characteristics.\n3.2.2 Heat Transport in the Furnace\nHeat is supplied to the furnace by induction heating from an r.f. generator\nhaving a frequency of 290 KHz. The shin depth in molybdenum at this\nfrequency is approximately 0.6 mm. The heat generation is primarily in\nIn the\nthe surface of the susceptor adjacent to the induction coils.\t\nstraight side susceptor design the heat generation is approximately uniform\nin the annular surface facing the coils. With the tapered susceptor the\nintensity of the field at the lip is considerably higher than that in the\nconical surface; thus the major portion of the heat is generated in the\n\nthin surface of the lip.\nAlthough only a small fraction of the total generation occurs in the thermal\nshield, this heat generation has an appreciable effect on its temperature.\nBecause the thermal shield is 1.5 mm thick the generation in the upper\nsurface is a significant fraction of the total generation in the thermal\n\nshield.\nFigure 13 shows the induction field geometry which was obtained using a conducting paper analog. It is seen that the field lines curve over the thermal\nshield which results in generation in the shield. The heating in the thermal\nshield is reduced by luwering the induction coils.\nHeat transfer from the susceptor atmosphere is by convection and radiation.\nConvective heat transfer to the argon was shown to be negligible compared\nto radiation. Heat transfer between the silicon melt and the thermal shield\nis primarily by radiation. The radiation transport is approximated by assuming that the an element of area on the surface of the melt exchanges\nradiation with only an element of area on the thermal shield located vertically above the element. Heat radiation exchange to surrounding surfaces is\nsmall because of the small spacing between the thermal shield and melt surface.\nThe net radiation heat flux between an area dAlon the melt surface and an\narea dA 2 on the thermal shield was calculated using the relation\n4\n\n4\n\n6(Ti _ T2\nq1\t\n\n_2\t\n\n1 -^\n\nE l\tE2\n\nC\t\n\n^\n\n27\n\n1NDUT\ncoil\n\nSUSGEE\n\nFigure 13, Induction field geometry in furnace. Most of\nheat generation is in the annular surface\nof suscepto r adjacent to induction coils.\n\n28\n\nwhere q -2 is the net heat flux from the melt to the t erma shield, a is\nthe Ste an-Boltzmann constant, and a is the emissivity of the surfaces. Subscripts (1) and (2) refer to the melt surface and thermal shield respectively.\nBecause the surface temperature of the melt and thermal shield temperature,\nT j and T9 respectively, are functions of the locations of dA l and dA 2 , ql-2\nwill depend on the location of the elements of area.\nThermal properties used in the calculations are listed in Table 2. Heat\ntransfer in the melt is assumed by conduction: bouyancy and surface tension\ndriven convection is assumed negligible. Further study is needed to determine the accuracy of this assumption particularly \' in furnace designs where\nthe temperature differences are large.\nHeat transfer through the quartz crucible is by conduction and\'radiation.\nAt the operating temperature of the furnace the quartz is transparent to\napproximately 80% of the radiation energy emitted by the susceptor and melt.\nHeat transfer through the quartz is primarily by heat conduction: radiation\naccounts for approximately 20% of the heat transfer.\n\n3.2.3. Two-Dimensional Temperature Distribution\nFigure 14 shows a section of the furnace with the nodal distribution used\nto calculate the temperature distribution in the straight sided susceptor.\nThe left boundary of the figure is the central axis of the furnace. A\nsimilar nodal geometry was used for the tapered susceptor. The depth of\nthe nodes was increased with radial distance from the center of the furnace\nto account for the circular geometry. The furnace is supported by a\ncylindrical alumina cylinder and has a single molybdenum thermal shield\ninside the cylinder.\nBecause this model is two-dimensional, the temperature distribution in the\nmElt has been approximated. A three--dimensional heat transfer model was\ndeveloped for studying the effect of the slot geometry and is discussed in\nthe section which follows.\nFigure 15 shows the isotherms in the furnace with a straight sided susceptor design. The melt temperature is approximately 45\xc2\xb0C lower at the\ncenter than that of the edge, the melt temperature increases with depth.\nThe outside surface temperature of the crucible is approximately uniform\nbecause the r.f. heating is uniform along the outer surface of the susceptor. The higher temperature near the top of the susceptor results from\nthe radiation shielding afforded by the thermal shield.\nThe thermal shield temperature is approximately 200\xc2\xb0C lower at the center\nthan that at the edge. This decrease is the re,ult of radiation losses\nto the environment from the upper surface and the high concentration of\ninduction heating in thr ndge of Lrie shield.\n\n\'I=\n\nI\n\nN)\nto\n\nFigure 14\xe2\x80\xa2 Modal geometry for two--dimensional heat transfer\nmodel.\n\nI\n30\n\na\t\n\no\t\n\nd\t\n\no\n\nrq\n\nTEMPS \xc2\xb0C\n\n3,2 CM\n\n1467\t\n\ni\n\nl46^\n\n1$S7\n\n14SZ\n\ns\n\n1\n\nFigure 15, Isotherms determined for straight side susceptor.\n\n31\n\nFigure 16 shows the isotherms in the furnace with the tapered susceptor\ndesign. The lip temperature reaches a temperature of approximately 1650\xc2\xb0C\nbecause of the high heat generation in this region. As a consequence of\nthe high concentrations of heat generation near the top of the susceptor,\nthe melt surface temperature is higher at the top than at the bottom. By\ncomparing Figures 15 and 16 it is seen that the radial temperature gradient\nis considerably greater than that for the straight sided susceptor design.\nThe high radial temperature for the tapered susceptor may be the reason that\nthe web widths that were obtained with it were small. It seems likely that\ngreater widths are attained with the straight side susceptor than with\nthe tapered design.\nA technique that has been considered as a possible means of improving the\ntemperature distribution is that of placing radiation ports in the bottom\nas shown in Figure 17. A three-dimensional model was developed to investigate the effect of the radiation ports. Figure 18 shows the effect radiation ports on the isotherms for a section taken along the center of the\nradiation ports. The solid lines are the isotherms with the radiation\nports, thus it is seen that the thermal model predicts that the radiation\nports effect only the melt temperature in the region of the radiation port.\nRather than reducing temperature in the melt as was originally anticipated\nthe model predicts that the melt temperature is increased slightly. The\nreason for the increase in temperature results from the fact that the\nbottom of the susceptor is at a lower temperature than the melt and therefore heat is conducted from the melt to the susceptor. Conduction serves a\nmore effective heat sink than radiation, thus the model predicts a decrease\nin the heat losses at the ports rather than increasing heat losses.\nExperimental data seems to contradict the analytical results which cannot\nbe explained at the present time. Some improvement in ribbon growth has\nbeen experienced when the ports are used, thus apparently the thermal effect\nis greater than indicated by the thermal model. Further study of this anomaly\nis needed.\n3.2.4. Effect of Slot Geometry on the Melt Temperature\nA three-dimensional heat transfer model was developed for the region of the\nmelt in the vicinity of the slot in the thermal shield. Figure 19 is a top\nand side view of the nodal geometry. Because of thermal symmetry, the\ntemperatures were determined for only the one-quarter of the melt region effected by the slot as shown in Figure 19. Because the three-dimensional\neffects only occur in the melt, only the melt was included in the model.\nThe boundary conditions were obtained from the two dimensional calculations.\nThis approach reduced considerably the computer time that would be required\nhad the entire furnace been modeled three-dimensionally. It does not appear\nthat the accuracy was significantly decreased.\nFigure 20 shows the isotherms on the surface of the melt for rectangular slot\n6.48 cm long by 0.9.55 cm wide using the straight side susceptor. As would\nbe expected the isotherms are elongated in the direction of the slot. Reductions of the temperature is highly desirable in order to encourage widening of the ribbon.\n\nTHERMAL.

Further reduction of the temperature gradient is obtained which is\naccompanied by a decrease in the temperature gradient in the direction perpendicular to the slot. The increased temperature uniformity is more desirable since it reduces the likelihood of the ribbon encountering a high\ntemperature melt. Thus the dog-bone slot provides a more favorable temperature condition than that of the rectangular slot.\n\n3.2.5 Effect of Silicon and Molybdenum Emissivities on Temperature\n- Distributions\t\n\nt\t\n\nAs mentioned earlier the emissivity coefficients of silicon contained in the\nliterature have considerable scatter. Thus, the emissivity values in Table\n1 and 2 could have considerable error. Although the effect has not been\ninvestigated, generally increased emissivities cause increased temperature\ngradients and vice versa. The radial melt temperature gradients shown in\nFigures 15, 16 and 18, for example would increase if higher emissivities\nwere used.\n\n38\n\nISOTHERMS AT MELT SURFACE\n0 CG\n\n0 Cj\t\nN\n\nli4{5\xc2\xb0C\n1\n\nSLOT\nF\n\n14 1290\n1409or\'\n1407087\n\n1.91 CM\n\n0.955 CM\n+\t\n\n3.24 CM\n\nFigure 21.

Experimental Observations\n4.1 Set up Web Furnace\nThis Task Element was approximately 90% complete at the start of the contract. The laboratory had been completed and the -Furnace and generator\nput in place, wired, and plumbed in; also it had been ascertained that\nboth the generator and furnace were workable. Gas controls for the protection of the system and for the leveling and shock vibration mounting\nsystem, temperature sensing and controls for generator/furnace and pulling needed to be completed before an actual test run could be made. These\nwere accomplished in the allotted time.\nThe four posts which acted as the legs of the furnace table were equipped\nwith a servo-level Vibration Isolation System made by the Barry Controls\nDivision of Barry Wright Corp. Nitrogen gas was used to activate the\nsystem. Initially the system was used mainly for leveling but also in the\nanticipation that it would keep out unwanted vibrations. later in the contract period, after several months of pulling experience, it was found that\nthe system appeared to be more of a hindrance than a help. Whenever the\ntable top was touched, vibrations were set up in the melt. A guard rail was\nattached to the floor on the side where the person who operates the tape and\nweb controls stood. This helped as far as touching the table top was concerned. It became evident that touching the controls on the furnace, or\nany part of the furnace, caused the melt to vibrate. To ascertain whether\nany vibrations in the room actually could cause vibrations in the melt if\nthe isolation system were not used, the acoustic vibrations in the laboratory were measured with the result that all vibrations detected in the room\nover a period of several days, were found to be below the cutoff frequency\nof the isolation system. Thus, for our laboratory, all we were getting from\nour Isolation System was leveling. We then stopped using the isolation system\nand leveled the table with the leveling screws on the table legs. Before\nusing an isolation system, it is suggested that a frequency study be made in\nthe room where the web puller is located, and not be used unless necessary.\nVibrations contribute to premature pull-out during web growth.\nA manifold to hold four argon tanks was constructed to allow one, two, three,\nor four tanks to be used through a single pressure regulator valve. Two\ntanks were used at a time with the other two kept in reserve. The pressure\nregulator valve was adjusted to give 120 psi. The gas to the furnace passed\nthrough a flow regulator; this was adjusted to 50 cfh during the time the\nfurnace was being brought up to temperature. When the silicon had melted,\nthe flow was reduced to 35 cfh. The two tanks would last 6 to 8 hours\nbefore it was necessary to switch tanks. After two mishaps and several\n"close calls", a low pressure warning buzzer was installed on the manifold\nto sound off when the pressure reached 100 psi - this gave ample time to\nswitch tanks.\n\n-i\n.1\n\n40\n\nThe purity of the argon is of prime concern. Standard tank argon was found\nto contain too much oxygen causing considerable SiO formation. Higher\npurity argon was obtained in tanks for a slightly higher price. These tanks\nwere carefully cared for by the Liquidair Corp. and filled first from the\nfirst half of storage tanks of liquid argon. This proved very satisfactory\ngiving minimal SiO generation. Two bottles of ultrapure argon (each costing 5 times that of the "higher purity" argon) were tried. No improvement\nover the "higher purity" argon was found; thus the very expensive ultrapure\nargon was not used. After 4 to 6 hours of operation SiO would usually build\nup on the edges of the heat shield opening to an extent that it interfered\nwith web pulling. SiO touching the web as it emerged from the heat shield\nwas one cause of the web going poly and/or third dendrite formation. For\nthe first year of the contract, when the SiO built up too much, it would be\nknocked down into the melt, and the melt temperature raised until it disappeared. Since this operation was time consuming, it was desired to have a\ntechnique to remove the oxide that did not necessitate knocking into the melt.\nA "vacuum cleaner" was devised that worked perfectly. It consisted of a\nlong quartz tube, 1/8" in diameter, (actually a piece of tubing used to make\nthe protective tubes for the thermocouple) attached to an aspirator by a\nlong piece of plastic tubing. This worked so well that it became our usual\npractice to remove the SiO long before it became a problem.\nThe biggest problem that was encountered in this task was the r.f. generator.\nActually it posed a problem periodically for practically all of the contract\ncausing us to lose approximately 5 months of the first year through actual\ndown time or having to repeat work done to be sere that the generator had\nnot interfered with the results obtained just before the generator quit.\nWhen we had obtained the generator, it came with an extra unattached condenser. When the generator was set up, according to the instruction manual,\nit ran at approximately 400 kHz. The generator was controlled by an Ircon\nOptical Pyrometer sited on the susceptor. The output fed into a digital\nreadout and into an Ircon Modline 3 mode proportional temperature controller.\nAn interfacing circuit was designed and constructed to match the output of\nthe Ircon control circuit to the magamp of the r.f. generator. The r.f.\ngenerator appeared at first to be operating satisfactorily; however, these\ntests were not run at full power. Attempts to heat a susceptor to 1500\xc2\xb0C\nfailed. At elevated temperatures, there was a lot of arcing which either\nkicked out the generator around 1000 to 1200\xc2\xb0C or caused us to reduce power\nto avoid a generator shutdown. Furthermore the voltage fluctuated at higher\npower. The generator was carefully checked over after several telephone\nconsultations with the Lindberg engineers. Finally a repairman, with knowledge in this series of generators, was called in. He said that the generator was functioning properly but the magamp control was unstable. The\nmagamp control was removed from the circuit, and an H. P. 6299A DC power\nsupply was purchased to drive the generator. A new electronic interface\ncircuit, Figure 22,was designed to match the output of the Ircon controller\nto the input of the D.C. power supply. After a few days, however, arcing again\noccurred so that it was not possible to raise the power high enough to melt\nsilicon. The problem was finally solved by adding another tank capacitor in\nparallel with the existing one, and melting of silicon was finally achieved.\n\nr\n\nCONTROLLER 70 C EN ERATOR INTERFACE Cl RCU IT\n\n2N15o5E\n\nI\n\nIT\n\nFigure 22. Controller to Generator.\n\n42\n\nThe generator and furnace were cooled with city water; however, several\ntimes the water pressure dropped during a melt causing the generator to\nshut down. A closed loop distilled water system cooled by a heat exchanger\nutilizing the building\'s closed loop chilled water line was designed, built\nand installed. !Unfortunately 6 months elapsed before the system was finally\ncompleted and installed. Just before it could be installed, the city water\ntemperature rose causing a catastrophic generator failure. This caused\nproblems, periodically, that were not definitely pinpointed until the contract was almost completed.\nThe r.f. work coil that came with the furnace had 11 turns of copper tubing\nwith a rectangular cross--section of 3/8" x 1/4". The coil was 5" tall and\nhad a diameter of 6". The coil was rigidly mounted on a platform that could\nbe raised and lowered. It soon became evident that x-y horizontal movements\nwere necessary to center the thermal symmetry each day. Two other coils were\nused in the final four months as will be taken up in Section 4.2. It became\nevident that the original coil was too long; the same number of turns were\nrequired in a shorter space to concentrate the heat more. The new coil was\nalso 6" in diameter but was made out of 1/4" copper tubing and was 3 3/4"\ntall. The spacing was maintained by four strips of silastic run up the\nsides and forced into the spacing between the coils. The final coil was\nmade of 1/4" copper tubing with a closer spacing to the turns and a larger\ndiameter to give more leeway in adjusting the center of thermal symmetry.\nThe coil height was 3 1/4" and the diameter 6 1/2".\nThe quartz envelope of the furnace consisted of GE quartz tubing 135 mm O.U.\nTo allow more x-y motion of the coil, the envelope was replaced with quartz\ntubing 130 mm OD.\nSeveral different types, shapes, and sizes of susceptors were examined to\ndetermine the best combination. Each susceptor was initially placed in\nthe vertical center of the work coil and the taps on the tank coil were\nvaried to find an optimum, if indeed there was one. These susceptors were:\n1.\n\n2.\n\nCarbon, 2.375" in diameter and 2.27" tall with straight sides. With\nthis susceptor the plate voltage was higher (10.7 Kv) and the plate\ncurrent was lower 0.88 amps); however, a maximum temperature of onl,,\n1470\xc2\xb0C was obtained. Since the generator was being pushed to its\nmaximum to get this temperature, and only a small silicon charge Lotild\nbe used, this susceptor was discarded.\n\n3.\n\n1.^\n\ncarbon, 3.25" in diameter and 3.625" tall with straight sides. Although\nthe voltage was low (7.5 Kv), the plate current limit (2 amps) was exceeded before the susceptor reached 1200%.\n\nMolybdenum, 4" diameter and 1 1/4" deep with a lip and tapered sides\nas shown in Figure 11. This susceptor with a straight slotted heat\nshield gave the first complete melt without straining the generator\n(approx. 8.5 Kv plate voltage and 1.6 amp plate current).\n\n43\n\n4. Molybdenum, 2.625" in diameter and 2.15" tall. With maximum plate\ncurrent (11.Kv), the susceptor never rose above 1100\xc2\xb0C. This susceptor was toe small for our setup.\nThe temperature of the melt was monitored by sighting on the bottom of the\nsusceptor with the Ircon optical pyrometer. Ideally it would be desireable to monitor the temperature at the growing interface; however, no\nsuitable technique for this has been devised. Temperatures were taken on\nthe bottom of the susceptor. These readings were lower than the actual\ntemperature at the surface of the melt. On the tapered susceptor with the\nlip, the optical pyrometer was later sighted on the under part of the lip\nwith the idea that the response would be quicker since most of the coupling\nwar. taking place on the lip. Using the button formation as a criterion,\nit was found that there was little or no difference between the response\ntime at the two sites. It was also found that the temperatures on the lip\napproached that of the maximum of our digital readout. For these reasons,\nall sighting was done on the bottom of the susceptors. The response time\nwas measured with thermocouples much later and confirmed these findings.\nAdditionally, results of thermal modeling showed that there should be no\ndifference in the response time for using either location for the control\ntemperature monitor.\n\nThe drawing of the crucible used throughout this work is shown in Figure 23.\nThe volume of the crucible is 85 cc. Thus the maximum charge of silicon\nthat the crucible can hold is 198 gms. This value can only be achieved\nby shaping a solid piece of silicon to fit the crucible. The initial silicon charges used to carry out the studies in this task were approximately\n100 grams. After these studies indicate, that the work on the furnace and\ngenerator, required of this task,was completed, a charge of 160 gms of\nsilicon was melted as a final check on the furnace and generator. This is\nthe maximum charge that can be put in with a slice of silicon (75 cm in\ndiameter) without shaping the slice to the contour of the crucible. Much\nof the studies reported in section 3.2 were made with charges between 90\nand 125 gms. The size of the charge was based on the calculations given in\nAppendix B.\nDuring the entire course of the contract a number of heat shields of different designs were used. Descriptions of them will be given in the appropriate places throughout this section. The heat shield used for the initial\nthermal probing of the melt in this task is shown in Figure 24. This shield\nhad too large an opening. The second shield used had a smaller opening as\nshown in Figure 25.\nThe heat shield is held above the susceptor by 4 tantalum pins as shown in\nFigure 26. The susceptor sat on a Molybdenum pedestal, also shown in the\nfigure. The plate at the base of the pedestal, in Figure 26, is\na diffuser plate made of molybdenum, a drawing of which is given in Figure 27.\nThe main purpose of the diffuser plate was to hold an inner quartz cylinder.\nSince the 4" susceptor was found to couple the best, the inner cylinder was\nnot used and thus the diffuser plate was abandoned.\n\nr\n\n1\n\n44\n\nv wrSI DE OlArACTER\n3,17%5\n\n<<\t\n\n4 "RADiuS SanOtA\n\nFigure 23..

The seed was attached to the free end of the\ntape. Initially the seed on the tape was held by a stainless steel wire.\nLater chucks were designed and used as w i ll be described in Section 4.2.3.2. The\ntake-up reel was driven by a Servo-Tec variable speed motor through a Metron\n600 to 1 reduction gear and an 8" drive wheel. The pull rate was measured\nfor various settings over the range of the variac. The curve is qiven in\nFigure C-1 of Appendix C along with curves for modifications made during the\ncontract. These modifications will be taken cep in Section 4.2.\nProof that the furnace and generator were operational and ready for pulling\ndendritic web was obtained when 102 gms of Si were melted and 4 1/2 inches\nof small diameter Czochralaski ingot were grown. This run also showed, as\ndid all runs after that, that the center of thermal symmetry was close to\nthe geometric center of the crucible.\nThe furnace operation procedures used initially are given in\n4.2\t\n4.2.1 \'\t\n\nTable D-1\n\nof Appendix D.\n\nPull Nominal Web based on 1965\nDendrites\n\nOnce the web furnace had been proven operational, it was necessary to have\nthe correct susceptor-heat shield setup and their placement in the r. f.\nfield to give favorable vertical and horizontal temperature gradients for\ndendritic growth. Also the operators had to gain experience in seeding\nand growth of dendrites and webs. Although actual values of the temperature\ngradients must be measured with a thermocouple, one can find relative information on the thermal gradients at the surface by probing the melt with\na seed and observing the shape, rate of growth, and symmetry of the buttons\nand wings formed. Information on the vertical gradients can be obtained\nby observing the growth behavior of dendrites being pulled at or near the\ngeometric center. Probing the melt with a dendrite seed was used here to\nattain conditions for web growth. later, especially starting in July of\n1976, thermcouple data was taken for a "fine adjust", (i.e., more critical\ncomparisions between set-ups).\nThe taper sided susceptor (TS, Figure 11) with the wide straight slot heat\nshield (WSS, Figure 24) had been used to prove the system operational as\nreported in Section 4.1 and thus was used at the start of obtaining conditions\nfor dendritic growth. We did not vary the design of the susceptor but stayed\nwith the TS susceptor. The initial runs with the wide straight sided heat\nshield gave rounded buttons that pulled free of the melt suggesting that\nthe surface temperature was too cold. Thus a heat shield with a narrow\nstraight sided slot (NSS, Figure 25)was made and used. This shield did\novercome the "cool" surface temperature of the wide slotted one; however,\nit was difficult to get dendrites, and when they were grown it was not\npossible to sustain growth. The longest dendrite grown with this shield\nwas 10 cm.: During this period, the main concentration on shaping the thermal\nconditions was on the vertical temperature gradient (i.e. surface of dielt to\nbottom of melt). The vertical temperature gradient study was done by raising\n\nso\n\nand lowering the r.f. coil. The coil position, CP, was varied from 5.45 cm\nto 10.45 cm (these values are the distance between the top of the coil and\nthe top of the susceptor). This means: that since the coil that we-were\nusing was 13.2 cm high (see Section 4.1), and the susceptor is 3.18 cm high,\nthe coil extended 7.75 and 2.75 cm respectively below the bottom of the\nsusceptor. When the CP was around 10.45 cm, the bottom of the susceptor\n"saw" more of the outside; thus the temperature gradient (TG) was largest.\nThis position was found to be not good because (a) if the surface temperature\nwas correct for dendrites to grow, the vertical gradient was too high, and\nthe dendrites would tend to freeze to the bottom, and (b) if the surface\ntemperature was adjusted to give a reasonable TG, ice formed on the surface\nwhen the temperature was dropped to give the AT necessary for growth. On\nthe other hand if the CP was in the vicinity of 5.45 cm, the TG was too low\nas a result of the bottom of the susceptor being more in the center of the\ncoil. This was not good either because (a) if the temperature was adjusted\n(i.e. lowered) to give a reasonable AT, the surface would be too cold resulting in ice formation, and (0) if the temperature was not adjusted buttons\nformed would pull out with no dendritic growth.\t\nThe optimum CP for this\nsusceptor/heat shield appeared to be in the neighborhood of 8.45 cm.\nThe difficulty in obtaining dendritic growth with this setup caused us to\nmeasure the temperatures. At this stage we felt that measurement of the\ntemperature of the surface of the melt, the heat shield, and the bottom of\nthe susceptor by optical pyrometry would give us the information we desired.\nAs can be seen in Figure 28and in Table 3, the position in the area of a CP\nof 6 to 9 cm appears to be about right. Comparison of temperature readings\nacross the narrow and wide straight slotted heat shields suggested that we\nwere wrong in our initial assessment of the wide slotted heal; shield. If\nwe had varied the CP over the wider range before going to the narrow slot,\nwe possibly would have gotten good dendrites earlier. This information\nlead us to go back to the wide shield where we were able to sustain dendritic growth for 50 cm at a CP of 8.45 cm.\nFrom this time on until the end of the dendritic portion of this task, we\nkept the susceptor/heat shield set up the same and at the same CP and concentrated on seeding techniques and pulling dendrites. This was necessary\n(a) to check out our pulling and guidance system in actual pulling, (b) to\nbuild up a good supply of seed material, and (c) to train our operators in\nseeding and growth.\t\nThe "transient seeding" technique was used. The procedure for this technique consists of:\nI. Find growth temperature. The growth temperature is taken as the\ntemperature at which a button begins to gro \xe2\x96\xba..\n2.\n\nRaise the melt temperature 15 to 20 0 above the growth temperature.\nDip seed into the melt to melt off end.\n\n3.\n\nReset temperature controller for the "growth temperature".\n\n4.\n\nAs temperature of melt drops, the seed is dipped into the\nmelt at 5 to 7 0 above the "growth temperature" to the seed.\n\na\n\n\t\n\nl\n\nM,\n\nSUSCEPTOR\n\n1320\n\n1310\n\n1300\n\nr\n\n5.95\t\n\n6.9.5\n\n\t\n\n7.95\n\n1290\n\nU\n1280\nUj\n\na\n\n1270\nLU\n\n1260\n\n1250\n\n1240\n\n1230\nFigure 2.8. }feat shield and susceptor temperatures in coil height.\nTemperature readings were taken on the bottom heat shield\nat a distance of 1/3 the shield diameter from the center.\n\ni\n\nI\n52\n\nTable 3.

This\ntechnique was used while we were tracking down the causes of the temperature variations and then while we were constructing an interface.\nThe technique was successful for seeding, but in itself lacked reproduciability. Also it was very difficult to sustain growth of web.\n5.\n\nAs melt temperature drops further, button growth begins.\nWhen wings form on button, pulling is started at 80 - 100%\non the speed controller (this corresponds to 6 to 7 cm per\nmin.).\n\n6.\n\nAs soon as the button starts to rise, decrease pull speed to\nthat for web growth unless it is desired to pull only dendrites - in which case do not change the pull rate.\n\nDuring these runs, a number of thit-Igs that had to be changed before we could\nhope to achieve web growth became evident. (1) It was found that buttons\ncould get caught on the guide fingers which had only fine control and no\nway to swing them out of the way quickly as the buttons were pulled up.\nThe control rods holding the fingers were modified to give a fast swing in\naddition to the fine control. (2) Several buttons caught on the chimney.\nThis was eliminated by splitting the chimney about i2 inches from the end\nand belling it out. This had the further advantage in that the chimney\ncould then act as another guide if necessary. (3) Another problem was\ncontrol of the temperature. We had been operating the furnace by manual\ncontrol using the Ircon controller only for reading the temperature of the\nsusceptor.. This mode of operating was too slow and did not allow precise\ntemperature control. Thus an electronic interface was designed that would\nenable the automatic controls of the Ircon controller to be used. On the\nfirst run using the interface we grew 50 cros. of very narrow web. On our\nnext run we were able to "sustain" growth and pulled a piece of web 45 cros.\nlong, and a dendrite 1.2 meters long.\nWe also found in this stage the importance of having the end of the seed,\nthat goes into the melt, very narrow.\n4.2.2 Webs\nThe webs mentioned above were not only very narrow but also they had not\nformed from the initial button but from a button formed on one of the\ndendrites that grew from the initial button. The second phase of this\ntask then was to perfect the conditions favorable for growth of webs with\nthe 1965 specifications. This called for a more careful and detailed look\nat not only the vertical TG but also the horizontal TG. To this end, in\naddition to the position of the coil relative to the melt (i.e., designated\nas CP .), the shape of the susceptor and the shape of the opening in the heat\nshield were studied. Also two ways of affecting vertical heat loss were\nexamined - (a) thermal insulation between the susceptor and the pedestal,\nand (b) after heaters on the heat shield. Each change generally meant\nvarying the CP to optimize it for the new setup; this usually took a week.\nInitially the setup that was used was the one with which we had gotten the\nweb, mentioned in 4.2.1, namely the tapered sided susceptor (TS, f= igure 11)\nand the heat shield with the wide straight slot (WSS, Figure 24). Since we\n\n54\n\nhad looked strongly at the vertical TG in Section 4.2.1 and since the web\ngrown at the end of that stage was very narrow, it was decided to investigate the horizontal TG by changing the slot opening in the heat shield to\nlower the horizontal TG and induce the edge dendrites to spread , apart. The\nfirst change involved putting holes at the ends of a narrow straight slot\nto form a "dog-bone" (SDB, Figure 29). As expected, the horizontal TG was\nflattened out; however, no improvement was seen in web widening. Comparison\nof the straight sided slot to the Dog-bone slot from thermal calculations\nbear out our finding as can be seen in Section 3.2.3. It appeared that\nthe straight part of the slot was too long, at least for the present webs.\nIn an attempt to correct this, a taper was put in the dog-bone (TDB, Figure\n30). This did not seem to help. We were still having difficulties with the\nvertical TG. All indications were that, although we were in a favorable CP,\nthe gradient was still too large.\nLooking then at the susceptor, it was apparent that most of the r.f. coupling\nwas taking place at the lip of the tapered susceptor and that most of the\nheat at the bottom came from conduction. Thus a large vertical AT may be\nexpected and attempts to rectify this by CP would be tricky. We then tried\na straight sided susceptor (SS, Figure 12) with the thought that r.f. coupling\nwould take place evenly up and down the sides resulting in more heat generation at the bottom and thus a lower vertical TG. These thoughts were borne\nout in heat transfer studies (Section 3.2). It was quite evident that the\nvertical TG had been drastically lowered, in that the coil had to be raised\n1 to 2 cm to get growth. The next attempt to lower the vertical TG was to\nretard the heat loss from the susceptor to the pedestal by use of Al 0\nspacers between the susceptor and the pedestal. Optical pyrometer dM was\ntaken on this setup, Figure 31, which showed that to be the case. Since the\nAl 2 03 spacer is not a complete thermal insulator, two thicknesses were tried;\nhowever, one spacer broke before this setup could be evaluated. Another\nmethod to lower the vertical TG was to use afterheaters, Figure 32, on the\nheat shield. The idea here was to retard the loss of heat from the opening\nin the heat shield and to keep the web hotter after it had left the heat\nshield, and thus reduce the heat loss by conduction up the web. Thermal\nmodeling of the ribbon will be found in Section 3.1. It was found that these\nafterheaters were too long and too tall. Their height made it impossible to\nview the button growth in the most crucial stage. Furthermore Si0 built up\non them badly, interfering w;th growth, and was loose and had a tendancy to\ndrop into the melt.\nIn all of the changes made in this stage (i.e. from 2 Feb. to 28 April 1976),\nsome webs were grown. These were invariably multidendrite webs, or webs\nthat grew from buttons formed on one of the grown dendrites. Finally toward\nthe end we were getting good buttons with 2 dendrites, but the web fell out\nbefore it could solidify. The attack on this problem will be taken up next\nin Section 4.2.3. \t\nWe were also losing webs and dendrites through jerking\nand vibrations. Some of this was caused by accidental jarring by the\noperator when adjusting the pull tape or control figures and part was\nmechanical and thermal. We noticed that the center of thermal symmetry\n\na\t\n\n55\n\n4,00v\n\nf\n\nV\n^\t\n\nt\n\n2.225"\n\n4\n\ns,il3 rr\n\n\t\n\n1101e5\nfn et 1AAL 5 F 44e\xe2\x80\xa20,335 x\'\n\nFigure 29.

In the case of the\ntaper sided susceptor, part of the problem was found to be that a piece\nof the molybdenum lip had chipped out around one hole for the tantalum pins\nthat held the heat shields. A new susceptor was made. Thermal symmetry,\nhowever, was also to the left on the TS susceptor. It became obvious that\nan x-y movement for the coil was vital. One was built and used. We had also\nnoticed that the coil was not fixed rigidly enough in the mount and would\noccasionally twist - especially when we raised and lowered the coil drastically.\nThus when the x-y motion was installed, the coil mount was altered to hold\nthe coil rigidly in place.\nAnother thermal problem was control of the temperature; we were getting\nfluctuations. Part of the problem was that our temperature meter could not\nbe read with enough accuracy. Replacing it with a digital readout solved the\nproblem. At the same time we replaced it, we reset the controls on the Ircon\ncontroller more precisely. Early in this stage, we had trouble with the melt\npulling to the front of the crucible so badly that we could see the bottom\nof the crucible at the back. Tilting the table with the vibration isolation\nlegs appeared to be of some help; however, sandblasting the inside of the\ncrucible eliminated the problem. Thus sandblasting was incorporated into\nour loading routine.\nThe drive wheel for the take-up reel that we had used up to the start of this\nstage had been 8" in diameter. This gave pull rates from 3 to 14 cm/min\nwell within the pull rates for dendrites but above the range for webs. We\nhad used this, however, since this was the desired range for webs for our\ngoal. It became evident, however, that we would have to work first with\nslower pull-rates. Thus a 4" drive wheel was made and installed. This\ngave us a pull rate range from 2 to 6 cm/min, see Figure C--1 in Appendix\nC which covered the to p of the web and bottom of the dendrite ranges.\nDuring this stage, primitive dendrites were grown to obtain seeds with other\ntwin spacings. This will be taken up in the following section.\n4.2.3 Web Fallout\n\nAlthough the studies reported in Section 4.2.2 \t\nled to web, the web was\nnarrow and invariably grew from a button that had grown on one of \xc2\xb0she two\ngrowing uendrites rather than starting directly from the button that grew on\nthe seed. The silicon that had been pulled up with the initial button dropped\nfree, for the most part, before it could solidify into a web. This led us to\nbelieve that the space between the surface of the melt and the bottom of the\nheat shield, or the heat shield itself, was too hot. Thus, in addition to\ncontinuing the studies to improve the vertical and horizontal temperature\ngradients, our attention was turned to the heat shield and the space above\nthe melt.\n\n60\n\n4.2.3.1 Thermal Aspects\n4.2.3.1.1. Parameters Affecting Temperatures Above Melt\nFigure 33 shows the various parameters investigated during the course of these\nstudies to control the temperature between the surface of the melt and the\nheat shield. The effect of e, the emissivity of the underside of the top heat shield, +-\',s reported in Section 4.2.2. Some effect\nhad been expected\t\nsee for c..ample equation 1 in Section 3.2.2; however,\nthe effect was much greater than we had anticipated.\t\nThe effect of the\nother parameters are given below:\n1. Crucibles: The shape, height, wall thickness, and variation in\nthe wall thickness of the crucible are all very important. The second batch\nof crucibles that we ordered were too tall, so much so that when placed in\nthe susceptor they touched the heat shield. Thos situation appeared to keep\nthe region above the melt too hot in that wa had to change the CP by 3 cm\nto correct for it, and then had difficulty in controlling growth. It was\nnecessary to shorten the crucibles by 1/8" to get normal results. We have\nreported the shift in the center of thermal symmetry from time-to-time. This\nwas shown to occur whenever we had a crucible that did not fit snugly and\nevenly in the cavity of the susceptor, F in Figure 23, (this was by no means\nthe only cause of shifts in thermal symmetry - others have been mentioned\nalready or will be mentioned later in this report). \t\nWe also found that if\nthe wall thickness of our crucibles exceeded 50 mils we were not able to\nmelt the silicon. Finally, we found a direct correlation to wall thickness\nvariation, t , and the center of thermal symmetry. Thus it is exceedingly\nimportant to v have very tight specifications on the crucibles; far more\nexacting than for other melt growth techniques and more exacting than was\nconsidered for web growth in the 1960\'s.\n2. Open space between heat shield and susceptor: As mentioned above,\nthe tall crucible blocked the loss of heat from this opening. To get the\nsurface of the melt at a lower temperature for growth, it was necessary to\nlower the susceptor in the coil because we were working below the center of\nthe coil at that timc.. Toward the end of the work for this section, we found\nit necessary to work with the susceptor above the center of the coil as will\nbe d,_scribed in the paragraph on C.F. (coil position). When we first moved\nto the top of the coil, we experienced icing from the periphery of the melt.\nIn an effort to overcome this, the four tantalum pins that held the heat\nshield above the susceptor were replaced with a solid annular molybdenum\nring in an effort to retard \'neat loss from the opening. The result was the\nsame as in the case of the opening being closed by a tall crucible. Heat\nwas indeed held in; however, since we were working toward the top of the\ncoil, it was necessary to raise the susceptor in the coil to obtain a lower\nsurface temperature. This in turn caused icing. Thus it seems quite obvious\nthat for the system shown in Figure 33, there must be an open space between\nthe heat shield and the susceptor.\n\n61\n\n\xc2\xb0T\n\nOPENING\nPSG\n\nCP\n\nEr\n0\n0\n0\nFigure 33, Parameters involved with temperature of the\nspace between the surface of the melt and\nthe bottom of the heat shield.\n\n62\n\n3. Coil Position (CP): we have already discussed, and will continue\nto discuss, the effects of changes in CP in our studies since it is the\neasiest and most direct way of changing the temperature of the surface of\nthe melt. During the first eight months of pulling, the susceptor was\nvaried in the bottom half of the coil. Initially we had the susceptor in the\ncenter of the coil and found that the vertical temperature gradient (TG) was\nuniform (see Section 4.2.4.) \t\nWhen the coil was aised, it was possible\nto change the vertical TG and the surface temperature enough for growth. On\nthe other hand, lowering the coil, even to the maximum (this still left the\ntop of the susceptor several centimeters from the top of the coil), did not\nappear to help. Thus we worked in the bottom half of the coil.\nIt was not until we added two inches to the pedestal that we could get be\ntop of the susceptor up high enough in the coil to show that working near\nthe top of the coil gave us much better control over the melt surface temperature and the vertical TG than working in the lower half of the coil. The\neffect of the coil position on the temperature of the heat shield, and the\ntemperature of the space between the heat shield and the surface of the melt\n(as evidenced by the temperature difference between the surface of the melt\nand the top of the heat shield above it) was seen from the optical pyrometer\ndata. For example Table 4 shows the top heat shield to be approximately 2000\ncooler at the edges and approximately 100\xc2\xb0 cooler in the center when the\nsusceptor is raised 2 cm from a CP (i.e., distance between top of the\nsusceptor to the top of the coil) of 7.05 cm. Raising the susceptor also\ngave a less drastic gradient from the edge of the heat shield to the center;\nCP 5.05 cm gradient was 90 0 , CP 7.05 cm was 230 0 . The temperature difference\nbetween the surface of the melt and the top of the heat shield can be illustrated by Figure 34 where the heat shield to melt TG was 106 0 at a CP of\n3.55 cm. Raising the susceptor in the coil one cm, increased the TG to 139\xc2\xb0;\nand raising 1/4 cm more, increased the TG to 1610.\n4. Height of heat shield above melt, S: It was felt that if the level\nof the melt was high^enough, it would be possible to pull the button through\nthe heat shield where the molten silicon could solidify into web before it\nfell under its own weight. To test this, 164 gms of silicon were used. Also\nthe heat shield was placed directly on the susceptor. This put S at approximately .4 to .5 cm rather than 1.4 cm that we generally had used. This\nappeared not to help; in fact the buttons were poor. In view of the discussion in 3. above, it now appears that our negative results were the result\nof not having an open space between the susceptor and the heatshield.\nIn Section 3.1.5, it was reported that the thermal modeling studies predict\na relationship between the pull rate and S; as S increases the pull rate\ndecreases. Our studies did not confirm this, but our studies were only\npreliminary, and it is felt that more experimental work in this area should\nbe done. In one of our studies to see the effect of S on the temperature\nabove the melt, a heat shield (NSS, Figure 25) that had bowed in the center\nwas used witha 100 gin melt. For this size melt, S was approximately 1.4 cm;\nhowever, with the shield concave upward S in the center region was approximately 1.8 cm and with the shield concave downward, S was approximately 1.0\n\nI\n\n63\n\nTable 4.

Thermal profiles in melt for various coil positions.\n\n65\n\ncm. Although we can say nothing from our pulling data about the effect of S\non the pull rate, it is quite obvious that there was an effect on the temperature. For S = 1.0 cm, the vertical TG was too great, necessitating Iowering\nthe coil from .2 to .4 cm below that necessary for S = 1.8 cm. Since we were\nworking in the region below the center of the coil, lowering the coil results\nin a decrease in the vertical TG.\n5. Ar flow: In the thermal modeling, Section 3.2.2, it was reported\nthat the contribution of convective heat flow to the Argon was so much less\nthan radiation losses that it could be neglected. Thus it is not surprising\nthat varying the Ar flow rate from 25 to 50 cph gave no effect on surface\ntemperature. It did, however, have an effect on the oxide build-up. The\n50 cfh is definitely recommended for purging the system during melting.\nFlow rates between 25 to 35 cfh, however, are recommended after the charge\nfor the day has melted.\n\n6. Seed: Although the desire to remove heat from the button to\nencourage the molten silicon drawn up between the dendrites to solidify\nwould suggest having seeds with large cross-sections, this is definitely\nnot what is wanted during seeding. The larger the cross-section of the\nseed, the more heat is conducted up it from the melt. Thus a large seed\ngives a greater radial AT than desired, resulting in a larger button, if not an\nirregular button, which in turn gives erratic growth. The cross-section\nof the seed should be as small as possible; not only does this help control\nthe AT but also keeps the button small, and aspect ratio large which has\nbeen found necessary for good yields of web.\n7. Meat Shields: The finish of the heat shield in regards to a has\nalready been taken up. The role of the width (W) of the opening on the\nheat shield to the temperature of the surface of the melt and the temperature above the surface of the melt was alluded to in Section 4.2.1. It\nwas pointed out there that heat was retained when a narrow straight slot\n(NSS) was substituted for a wide one (WSS). The width of the opening in\nthe heat shield, however, is intimately associated with the length and\nshape. Since the opening (width, length, and shape) in the heat shield is\nused primarily to shape the surface isotherms, the width effect will be taken\nup in another part of this section. Three other factors that could influence\nthe temperature of the heat shield, and thus the temperature between the heat\nshield and the surface of the melt, were investigated; these were:\na. Diameter (d) of the heat shield: All heat shields had been cut to\nthe same diameter as the susceptor - namely 4". It v as quite evident, f rom\nthe color shading of the shields, that the periphery of the shield was\ncoupling with the r.f. This was borne out by optical pyrometer data. It\nwas found that, for U e same type of shield opening, the 4" diameter shield\nhad a higher TG between shield and melt than did the 3.885" diameter shield\n(the temperature of the melt surface in each case was approximately the same).\n\n\t\n\nI\n66\n\nM\t\n\nb. Thickness (t) of the heat shield: The first shields that we used at\nthe beginning of the contract, see Section 4.2.1, were 40 mils thick. It\nwas found, however, that after a few days the shields began to bow and after\na week or two were too bowed for use. Thus all shields after that were made\nfrom 60 mil thick sheet - these held their shape on prolonged usage. Since only the\nperiphery of the shield receives heat through coupling with the r.f., the\ncenter of the shield receives its heat from conduction through the sheet and\nfrom radiation from the melt. In our studies to reduce the temperature in\nthe interior of the shield, we looked again at thinner shields as a way to\nreduce coupling at the perifery and conduction across the shield. Shields\nmade from 40, and even 20, mil thick sheet did not, however, show any noticeable change, over the 60 mil shields, in our seeding and growth; although\nthere did appear to be a slight decrease in temperature by visual observation. We did, however, run into the bowing problem with the 40 and 20 mil\nthick shields. It was particularly bad with the 20 mil thick shields which\nlasted only a run or two. Looking, however, at thicker shields, we found\nthat using a 60 mil thick shield, the TG from the periphery to the opening\nof the heat shield was approximately 190 1 , while a 1/4 " thick shield with a\n60 mil shield above it, see Table 4 , the TG was only 90 1 . Thus the thicker\nundershield lessens the temperature drop to the opening. It should be\npointed out that the temperature drop across a 45 mil shield was predicted to be 270\xc2\xb0 from the thermal modeling studies (Section 3.1). This\nis far greater than any drop found experimentally for any configuration.\nc. Number of top heat shields: The effect of two top heat shields on\nthe temperature above the melt was investigated. To test this heat\nshield LDBeW (Figure 35) was used in the regular position, a heat shield\nwith a larger opening LDBeWM2 (Figure 36) was positioned 1/8" above it.\nThis arrangement gave no improvement. Then two heat shields - both LDBeW were used, but again we found no improvement. Later two heat shields with\nthe LDBeW opening were used - the one nearest the melt was 1/4" thick and\nthe one above it 60 mils. Puns were also made using only one or the other\nof these shields. The thermal data one should compare for the effect of\nthese shields on the shield temperature and the temperature of the space\nbetween the top heat shield and the surface of the melt, are just that\ntemperature difference. The data is given here in Table D-2 of Appendix D. The\nheat shield to melt TG is measured with an optical pyrometer and thus one can expect,\nand finds, variations in the data; however, there is enough difference to be\nable to compare the effects of the shields. Examining this data at the same\nCP, one can see that the TG for the 1/4" thick shield alone is less than that\nfor the 60 mil thick shield alone as would be expected from our discussion\non the thickness of the heat shields where we compared the temperature across\nthe heat shields from the perifery to the center. Thus the thicker 1/4"\nshield is hotter at the center giving the expected low TG. This more uniform temperature across the 1/4" shield, then lessens the temperature drop\nat the center of the 60 mil shield when they are used together and gives an\nintermediate TG as can be seen in Table D-2, the 1/4" shield and the two\n\n67\n\nr\n\n11\n\nf.\n\n4.0\n\nu\n\n$/9 "\'n-\n\n7/23\t\n\n.375\ni\naf6R\n\n\\ 3.7CL5 \'iP.\n\n-vs "\n\n.\'Od IN MOLVeDENCIM\n\nFigure. 35.

At the end of this phase of the investigation we had settled\non one top shield, 60 mils thick, and studied the changes caused by different\nopenings.\n\n4.2.3.1.2 Shape of Thermal Gradients\nThe shape of the thermal gradients - both horizontal and vertical - are\nvital to the successful growth of web while the horizontal gradients are far\nmore important in the widening process. Figure 37a, shows the desired\ntemperature isotherm across a melt for a growing web. This gradient, if\npresent initially would only be of use if one could seed directly from a\nweb of the desired width - something that has not been possible to do, as yet\nat least routinely. The correct growth isotherm results from the proper\nbalance between an initial isotherm such as Figure 37b, and the heat given\noff from the solidification of the button and the growing web as shown in\nisotherms, c through e. Isotherm e, is the practical realization of the\ndesired isotherm. As can be seen in Figure 37b, the desired starting isotherm has a AT of from 3 to 7\xc2\xb0. The growing button puts heat into the\ncenter of the isotherm and on pulling we get the situation in Figure 37c.\nThe large cool regions to either side of the growing web encourage the edge\ndendrites to spread apart as shown in Figure 37d. Then when the planned\nwidth is reached, Figure 37e, the desired isotherm, Figure 37a, is very\nclosely approximated, and growth continues with no further increase in\nwidth.\nFigure 38 illustrates what can happen if the temperature gradient is too\nsteep. We stress the steepness of the gradient rather than the AT, for\na AT that is good for one heat shield opening may not be good for a different one. This is illustrated in Figure 38a by the dashed isotherm\nA ---A; for this isotherm the AT is the same as that used in Figure 37 but\nwith a heat shield opening of 1/2 the length. As can be seen, the gradient\nis as steep as the one we have illustrated. For too steep a gradient,\nseeding takes place too rapidly and one obtains a primitive growth mass\n(see Section 4.2.1) or an irregularly shaped button. A steep gradient\ncan result in seeding; however, the buttons form very quickly making the\ngrowth difficult to control. Furthermore the edge dendrites tend to grow\ntoo deeply into the melt. These two combine to make it difficult and in\nsome cases impossible, to maintain the "pockets" B in Figure `38b, that\ninduce widening. Thus the edge dendrites will not grow apart giving a\nconstant width, or if the edge dendrites are deep enough into the melt,\nthey will grow inward seeking the cooler center below the surface resulting\nin web narrowing as illustrated in Figure 38c. Although this type of gradient\nwas present when the AT was too large for a given heat shield opening, it\nwas quite often encountered unintentionally using the transient seeding\nThe correct isotherms in the melt\ntechnique described in Section 4.2.2. \t\n\n70\n\nmp.\t\n-3\n\nDesired (a)\n\nnip.\n-7\xc2\xb0\n\nInitial - before (b)\ndipping seed.\n\n4\nseed button\nDip seed and grow\nbutton - comr.ence\npulling\t\n(c)\n\nDuring widening (d)\n\nFinal width pulling (e)\n\nFigure 37.

The changes made during this phase of\nthe investigation to obtain the desired isotherms are given below. For the\nmost part, the effect of changes were assessed from the way in which the\nbuttons and webs grew; however, numerous times throughout this part of the\ninvestigation thermal data was taken to understand better the isotherms in\nthe melt.\n4.2.3.1.3 Temperature Measurement Techniques\nAll of the temperature data reported in Section 4.2.2 was taken with an\noptical pyrometer (Pyrometer Inst. Co. Model 95) that had been checked\nagainst a Leeds and Northrup optical pyrometer (Model 8621). This type of\ninstrument is not as accurate as thermocouples for the following reasons:\n(a) necessity of sighting through the quartz furance wall whose optical\ntransmission continually changes during a run (fortunately the change is\nusually not enough to cause a problem, especially over a short period,\ni.e., one or two hours), (b) difficulty in sighting on the exact spot\nagain, (c) possible variation in emissivity of the surface being sighted,\nand (d) accuracy in matching the color of the filament to the surface. It\ndoes, however, have the advantage that temperatures can be taken during\npulling. For this reason it was used to yet temperatures on the surface\nof the melt, heat shield and susceptor each time a change in the susceptor/heat\nshield setup was made. Temperature data within the melt, however, is necessary\nto study the effect of a change within the melt or to get readings across the\nsurface of the melt in fine detail. Such data can only be obtained by using\nThermocouples. Thermocouples were made up from Pt - Pt 10% Rh run through\nsingle bore quartz tubing .06 in diameter. This was placed inside a quartz\nprotective tube .125" in diameter and sealed at one end. The emf was measured\nusing a digital microvolt meter. The first thermocouple had a straight end\nand was used with an LDBwWM2 heat shield on an S5 susceptor which rested on\na Mo pedestal with no bottom heat shields. The melt charge was 50 gms.\nThe thermocouple data is given in Table D-3 in Appendix.D. Here it can be seen\nthat the TG from the "surface" of the melt (Just below the surface) to the\nbottom is 45 0 . This in itself is not too unreasonable for such an open heat\nshield; however, the data showzd a problem in that (a) the highest temperature reading, on the bottom, is 100\xc2\xb0 below the melting point of silicon and\n(b) the readings in 7 surface positions indicate an essentially isothermal\nsurface 150 0 below the melting point of silicon \t\nThese results indicated that\n\n73\n\nwe were not getting true results because too much heat was being conducted up\nthe quartz tubing. To see if this was caused by the straight thermocouple\nor by the small melt charge, the measurements were repeated with twice the\nsilicon - i.e., a 100 gm charge. The data is given in Table 0-4 of Appendix\nD. Here one can see more realistic temperatures at the bottom of the melt.\nThe temperatures across the bottom are more uniform than predicted in the\nThermal Modeling Section. Tile TG across the melt approximately .5 cm below\nthe surface is not only relatively large but also approximately 100 0 below\nThis indicates that the straight thermocouple\nthe melting point of silicon. \t\nis conducting too much heat from the regions within .5 centimeters of the\nsurface. In an effort to get realistic readings, the ends of the thermocouple\nTC, were bent to make approximately 1/4" of the TC parallel to the surface.\nTable D-5 of Appendix D gives the data obtained using this new TC. Here one\ncan see that the readings are consistent with the melting point of silicon.\nThus all measurements thereafter, were made using bent TC\'s.\n4.2.3.1.4 Vertical Tem perature Gradients\n_.\t\n\nThe vertical TG can be shaped by manipulating the heat loss from the top and\n-___the bottom of the susceptor. The factors that influence the heat losses are\nshown in Figure 39. The fact that the argon atmosphere has a negligible\neffect on -the. heat loss compared to radiation was shown in Section 3.2.2 and\nit was reported in the discussion on the temperature above the melt that this\nwas found to be correct experimentally. The factors involved in heat loss\nfrom the top are: the dimensions of the seed (i.e., thickness acid width),\nthe radiation loss from the grown web, and the heat shield - number, diameter,\nthickness and opening. The coil, number of turns, height, diameter, and of\ncourse CP (position of the susceptor in the coil) affect the heat input and\nas such the heat loss from not only the top but also the bottom. The factors\nthat affect heat loss from the bottom are the susceptor, shape and size;\npedestal, type of material, and spacers, and bottom heat shields, number,\ntype, and thickness. These are taken up individually below.\n4.2.3.1.4.1 The K.F. Coil: During this phase of our investigation, two coils\nwere used. These coils contained 11 turns. Full details on the makeup of\nThe taller coil\nthese coils is given in Section 4.1 - "Set Up Web Furnace" \t\n(13.2 cm high) was used initially and throughout most of this phase. Problems\nof coupling with the top and bottom heat shield along with the high power\nrat;ng necessary to melt the silicon, and the desire to give us more control\nover the vertical TG, led us to make a new coil with smaller diameter copper\ntubing and closer spacing between turns to give a shorter coil - 9.53 cm.\nAn attempt was made to use a coil with a lesser number of turns; however,\nthis turned out to be impractical.\n\nCOIL\n\nI\t\n\nSEED\n\nQ\nTOP HEAT SHIELD\n\nQ\nEl\nEl\nEl\n\n= SUSCEPTOR\nBOTTOM SHIELD\n\nSI\n\nPEDESTAL\n\nFigure 39. Heat losses involved in vertical temperature gradients.\n\n75\nThe effect of the position of the coil (CP), the distance between the top\nof the coil and the top of the susceptor, on the temperature of the heat\nshield was discussed in some detail in the part on the temperature of the\nspace between the heat shield and the surface of the melt. Its effect on\nthe temperature gradient into the melt was only briefly discussed in Section\n4.2.2.\t\nIn this phase of the investigation, thermocouples were made up\nand data taken within the melt at several heights and several locations\nacross the slot in the heat shields. Comparing the temperature reading at\nthe top, middle, and bottom of the melt it can be seen that the gradients\ncan be changed as desired by changing the CP. For example in Figure 40\nwith the CP of 4.05 cm,, the top of the melt and the middle were at approximately the same temperature and 3 0 hotter than the bottom of the melt.\nWith a CP of 3.70 cm, the top was 131 cooler than the middle and bottom\nwhich were at approximately the same temperature. Changing the CP to\n3.55 cm left the top cool - it was 5 0 cooler than the bottom of the melt;\nhowever, the middle was now hotter than both the top and the bottom. There\nwere numerous examples, involving changing between cool top, medium center,\nhot bottom; cool top, hot center, medium bottom; medium top, cool center,\nhot bottom; etc., by moving the CP. There are also examples where a change\nin CP did not result in a change in the sequence - see Figure 41 where the\nsequence did not change on changing the CP by 0.3 cm, but the temperature\nbetween top and bottom was changed.\n4.2.3.1.4.2 Susce tor: The diameter and the type of material used in the\nsusceptor were lscussed in Section 4.1. The effect of the shape of the\nsusceptor was taken up in Section 4.2.2 where it was shown that a straight\nsided susceptor (Figure 12) drastically reduced the vertical TG over that\nof the taper sided susceptor (Figure 11). This fact coupled with the thought\nthat the straight sided susceptor should give the widest material (Thermal\nModeling studies, Sec. 3.2.3) caused us to use the straight sided susceptor\nthroughout this stage of the investigation. This fact was reconfirmed by\nthermal data coupled with web pulling during this stage of tte investigation.\nIt was necessary to lower the tapered sided susceptor into the coil almost\n3 cm below that for the straight sided susceptor. In an effort to reduce\nfurther the heat loss through the bottom, a new susceptor was made that was\n2.5" high, rather than 1.25". This gave a thickness below the crucible of\n1.50" of mo rather than our usual .25". That it did not decrease the heat\nloss out the bottom was evidenced by the fact that it was necessary to lower\nthe susceptor until the bottom was almost below the bottom turn of the coil.\nFurther the large mass of the susceptor caused the controller to overand undershoot its set point by 5 to 7 0 , causing difficulty in getting\ndendrites to grow on the buttons, and causing "drop-out" of the web from\nthese buttons that did get dendrites. Throughout the course of this phase of\nthe investigation, a number of top heat shields were used with these suceptors. Tl^e various susce p tor/heat shield combinations are Qiven in Table 5.\n4.2.3.1.4.3 Pedestal: The susceptor was supported on a molybdenum pedestal as reported in Section 4.1. Quite a bit of heat was. conducted down the pedestal.\nIn an effort to reduce the conduction loss down t;ie pedestal, one Al 2 0 3 wafer\n.025" hick was placed between the pedestal and the susceptor and later two\nspacers. These results were inconclusive. They were again tried in conjunction with bottom hea y shields. The thermal results will be incorporated\n\nwith the discuss > ,l^ L. Li bottom heat shields. Tile final effort on the\npedestal was to do away with molybdenum and replace it with an Al 2 03 pedestal\n\n_\nar- Tor os\t\n\n-\n\n0\n\n76\t\n\n-\n\ndif-\n\nca\n3.55 cm"\n\nCP\n\nI\n\nCi:\n-\n\nCP \xe2\x80\x9eT,70 3.70 cm\n\n\'\nCP\n\n- l7/.oO LF,\nl30T rcry\n^\t\n\nicr\n\nf, 05 4.05 cm\n\n!dd5 "G\n\nMeot\n\n/.I\n\'MU\n\nY395T,\n\n/3wt\nTMITIM\nRELATt IJE TO\n\nSLOT\nSET UP : 6\'x4\'\' T, ^P^klc^^ 1, !^lG^ Y\n\nt Z5"x 4"\n\ns4zMte.

Dates signify first time the arrangement was used.\n4.\n\nResults of these arrangements are given in the text.\n\n79\n(see Figire C-2 in Appendix C). The Al 0 pedestal was not used without\nbottom heat shields during this phase o 2 he investigation, thus nothing\nf\ncan be said of its action alone, at present. It is quite evident, however,\nthat the Al 0 pedestal did even out the bottom temperature gradients. It\nwas found n9cssary to ground the susceptor when the Al 0 pedestal was used\nto eliminate thermionic emission. A 20 mil tungsten w3r3 hooked around one\nof the pins and the base was found to be a sufficient ground.\n4.2.3.1.4.4 Bottom Heat Shields: \t\nThe first attempt to control heat loss from\nthe bottom of the susceptor by heat shields employed the diffuser plate (Figure\n27) placed on the Mo pedestal one inch below the susceptor. The r.f., however,\ncoupled so strongly to the 1/4" thick molybdenum plate that it was impossible\nto melt the Si charge. A bottom shield was designed (Figure 42) and made from\n40 mil molybdenum. This was placed 1/16" below the susceptor on the molybdenum\npedestal. It did, indeed, cause a reduction in heat loss resulting in a more\nuniform temperature across the bottom of the melt. Two molybdenum shields\nwere then used but this arrangement made little difference compared to one\nheat shield in the temperature gradient across the bottom of the melt. It\ndid, however, allow the use of lower power from the generator. Three heat\nshields were used to gain information For the Thermal Analysis Section that\nindicated it would be better. Three shields, however, gave no improvement.\nAn attempt was made to reduce the r.f. coupling to the bottom shield by\nmaking it 3/8" in diameter. This did have an effect but did not appear to\nbe beneficial.\nThe Al 0 3 pedestal (Figure C-2) was used in place of the molybdenum pedestal\nshown ?n Figure 26 first with 4 molybdenum bottom heat shields. Later two\nbottom Mo shields were used and finally only one bottom shield was used. It\nwas found that 4 heat shields gave a temperature difference from the top to\nthe bottom of the susceptor of 44\xc2\xb0, Table 4, while 2 heat shields, Table 5,\nat the same CP, gave a temperature difference of 74\xc2\xb0. The difference between\n4,2 and 1 heat shields gave little practical difference; thus one shield was\nsettled upon for ease of set-up. In an effort to see the effect of the\ncoupling of the r.f. to the heat shield, shields were made from Al 2 O3 . As in\nthe case of the molybdenum shields, a second heat shield does give a greater\nreduction in the heat loss from the bottom. One could, however, see little\ndifference between the Al 2 0 3 shields which cannot couple, and the Mo shields\nthat can couple.\n4.2.3.1.4.5 Seed: The role of heat conduction up the seed and its effect on\nthe vertical TG have already been discussed in conjunction with the temperature between the top shield and the melt earlier in this section.\n4.2.3.1.5 Horizontal Temperature Gradients\n4.2.3.1.5.1 Top Heat Shields: Earlier in this section the effects of the\ndiameter, thickness, and number of the heat shields on the temperature of the\nheat shields, the TG between the top of the heat shield and the melt, and the\ngradients across the melt were discussed. It was pointed out that the size\nand shape of the opening in the heat shield was used mainly to shape the\nsurface isotherms in th^ melt and would be taken up in this part of the\nsection. In Section 4.2.2 we discussed the firs;: investigations an shaping\nthe isotherms - that of cutting "large" holes at the ends of the narrow\nstraight slot to form, a\t\ng--bone and of tapering the slot opening to form\na tapered dog-bone (M).

Toward the latter part of this phase of the\ninvestigation, thermal modeling studies were applied to thermal gradients\non the surface of the melt for four different shapes of openings simulating\nSection 3.2.4), the dog-bone (Figure 21,\nthe straight slat (Figure 20, \t\nSection 3.2.4), the dumbell (Figure 43) and the Bow Tie (Figure 44) which\nThe temperatures at the same distance\nwill be taken up in Section 4.2.4.\t\nin inches from the center of the slot towards the end of the slot were\ntaken from these figures and listed in Table 7 for easy comparison. As\ncan be seen the values of the temperature at any given distance from the\ncenter are essentially the same for all four, as pointed out in the discussion of Figures20 and 21 in Section 3.2.4. By comparing the figures,\nhowever, one can see that there are differences in the temperature gradients.\nActual values of the temperature across the slots are given in Table D-2 in Appendix D for one and two heat shields with the LDBeW (Figure 35) opening in Table\n8 for several other shields. Examining these tables and the figures with\nthe thermal data, it can be seen that the measured values do not show great\ndifferences and are, for the most part, quite similar to those found in the\nThermal Modeling studies. This is further made evident by Figure 45. The\npoints are the actual experimental data and the solid lines are curves with the\nlowest point fixed on the experimental point at the center. Two things can\nbe seen on a careful study of the experimental data: (1) a difference however slight -- can be seen between some shields, and (2) the difference in\ntemperatures along the slot depend on the position of the susceptor in the\nr.f. coil (i.e., CP).\nIn shaping the isotherms, the temperature gradient along the centerline of\nthe slot (i.e., left to right, L--R) is not, however, the only gradient to\nbe considered; the front to back (F-B) is very important to control button\nshape and thickness of the web. The figures giving the isotherms for the\nfour simulated heat shields calculated from Thermal Modeling( Figures 20,21,\n1 3, and 44) indicated that the temperature difference between the centerline\n4\nof the heat shield slot and that under the heat shield to the Front and\nback was approximately 5 0 in all four cases. Table 9 compares experimental\ndata taken on three different shields. Here one can see that for all but\nthe heat shield with the widest (i.e. width of a slot is the front-to-back\ndistance) the temperatures just under the heat shield are 4\xc2\xb0 to 8\xc2\xb0 hotter\nthan in the slot; the wider shield has a value of 15 0 to 20\xc2\xb0. One can also\nsee that these gradients are becoming less step in the melt, as one would\nexpect.\nAs was mentioned above, one can see on careful examination and comparison\nof the temperature gradient that there does appear to be differences at\nleast between several of the heat shields. One should also notice that\nalthough the thermocouple data taken here was recorded from a digital\nmicrovoltmeter, the apparent fluctuations in the temperature could be as\nhigh as 50 to 100 microvolts. At these temperatures, a voltage of 12\nmicrovolts is equal to 1\xc2\xb0. For this reason, one cannot rely on temperature\nuata alone to chose an optimum setup: the growth of buttons and dendrites\nis far more sensitive to temperatures and temperature gradients than are\nthermocouple readings.

For example (a) if the temperature at\nthe surface is too hot the buttons will be rounded rather than faceted,\n(b) if the temperature is too cool the button will be irregular and in\nsome cases have twin lamellae being initiated and wings growing at odd\nangles, (c) if the temperature is close to being correct but is still\non the hot side, the button may be well faceted; however, on pulling it\nwill pull free and be smooth on the bottom rather than pulling into\ndendrites and (d) if the temperature is close to being correct but is on\nthe cool side, the button may be well faceted, but on pulling one obtains\nthree or more dendrites. Examples of these are found in Table 10 which\ngives the aspect ratios (i.e., width to length) of the buttons for various\nMere\nheat shields (Table 5) used in this section and at different CP\'s. \t\none can see that the most desirable aspect ratios are from 1/2 to 1/5.\nAspect ratios less than this (i.e., 1/1, 2/3/ etc.) and greater than this\n(i.e., 1/7, 1/8, etc.) usually do not give good results. One can see that\nthe long narrow slots favor good aspect ratios.\n4.2.3.1.5.2 Seeds:\t\nThe effect of the size of the seed-on the temperature\nof the melt was taken up earlier. The seed also plays a vital roll in the\naspect ratios of the buttons and in the seeding itself which is vitally\nconnected to the discussion just completed. The seeds should be thin;\nif they are too thick the width of the button will be thicker than desired\nand the button will then be too large. The number, spacing and continuity\nof the twin planes across the button are very important. The necessity\nof having three closely spaced twin planes is well known in the literature\nand was evident several times during the course of the work. Tile necessity\nof having the twin configuration continuous across the cross-section of\nthe seed is also well known; failure to do so can result in the button\nforming no wings (NW) or wings on one side only (11)) possibly some of\nthe buttons reported in Table 10 could be the result of this. The effect\nof the spacing of the three twin planes on the growth of silicon dendrites\n(and thus web) had never been investigated as it was for Germanium. For\nGe it was found that twin spacings above 10n and below .5V were not\nfavorable and that optimum spacing between two of the three twins was 1.7u\nwith the third twin being .5u away from either of these two.\n4.2.3.2 Mechanical and Growth Aspects\nThis phase of the investigation was directed toward the thermal aspects in\nan effort to retain the web for a sufficient time between the two edge\ndendrites until it could solidify, and to encourage widening. We had noted\nproblems of premature pull-out not only of web but also of dendrites and\npicking up "third" dendrites (i.e., one or more extra dendrites either within\nthe web or to the outside of the edge dendrites). Although much of this was\n\n90\n\nTable 10.

Perhaps one of the biggest\nnon-thermal problems was the generator itself. During this phase of the\ninvestigation (approximately 8 1/2 months), the generator was down a total\nof approximately 2 1/2 months for various reasons - including over one month\nfor a cooling water system that had been ordered b months prior to the breakdown. The generator problems, however, have been taken up earlier (Section\n4.1) and will not be repeated here. It should be pointed out, however,\nthat the 2 1/2 month down time was not the only time lost as a result of\ngenerator breakdown. On a number of occasions the generator "acted up" for\na day or two before breaking down, putting the studies made during those\ntimes in question; it was thus necessary to rerun such data to see if the\nresults had been influenced by the generator problem or by the changes we\nhad made. Other problems found and corrected were:\n(1)\n\nInadvertant jarring of the furnace by the operator: This was\ngreatly decreased by rearranging the positions of the controls\nand by the addition of a guard rail rigidly attached to the\nfloor to support the operator when it was necessary for him\nto reach above the furnace.\n\n(2)\n\nSlipping of the drive wheel against the take-up reel: ThE\nrubber strip on the drive wheel loosened up. Attempts to\nstop the slipping by using epoxy to hold the rubber band\non the wheel resulted only in a temporary solution. It\nwas necessary to fabricate a new 4" drive wheel that\nemployed standard sized O-rings to provide the friction.\n\n(3)\n\nX-Y motion of the coil: The necessity of being able to\nmove the coil in a horizontal x-y motion so that the center\nof thermal symmetry could be made to coincide with the\ngeometric center has already been discussed. During this\nphase, it was found, however, that sometimes it was not\npossible to adjust the coil enough because of arcing when\nthe coil was moved too close to the quartz furaace wall.\nPart of this was due to contamination that builds up on\nthe walls in the neighborhood of the coils over an extended period of time. This effect could be greatly reduced by cleaning the inside of the furnace walls with\nHF-HNO3 solution or eliminated by using a new tube. Occasionally it was found that this was not sufficient. It\nwas necessary to use a smaller diameter tube for the\nfurnace envelope. We had been using a tube 135 mm in\ndiameter but found that a tube 130 mm in diameter could\nbe used. This change helped greatly in positioning the\ncenter of ther--tal symmetry.\n\n92\n\n(4)\n\nPositioning of susceptor: In line with the preceding, it was\nalso found necessary to be sure that the susceptor and shields\nwere always replaced on the pedestal in the same sense. Care\nwas always taken to be sure that the susceptor was correctly\nseated on the pedestal.\n\n(5)\n\nSeed holders: The seed holder that had been used in the last\nbegan to give us troubles in that the seedF\nphase Sec. 4.2.2)\t\nwould quite often fall out. Also it was difficult to align the\nseed properly such that it would be perpendicular to the melt.\nThe seed holder shown in Figure 46 was designed and installed.\nIt solved the problems that we were having at the time.\n\n(6)\n\nA two inch drive wheel was made and used near the end because\nwe felt that we should drop our pull rate below the 2 cm/min\nlimit of the 4" drive wheel during the period while the molten\nsheet was solidifying into web. The pull rate curves for the\n2" drive wheel are given in C-1 of Appendix C.\n\nThe above mentioned thermal and mechanical changes made during this phase\nhelped greatly in obtaining our goal for that phase - namely getting two\ndendrite web to grow from buttons that were grown on the seeds. Three\nchanges in procedure, however, should be mainly credited with the attainment\nof our goal.\n1.\n\n2.\n\nChanges in temperature and pull rate: We found that abrupt\nchanges of 1 0 or more in the temperature during pulling invariably led to the web falling free at the start or to the\nweb and edge dendrites pulling free at any time after the\nweb had solidified. This was especially true when we were\nusing the transient seeding technique. In a like manner\nabrupt increases in the pull rate led to the formation of\n"third" dendrites in the web portion or to the outside of\neither edge dendrite. The latter effect was enhanced if\nthe web was growing in an asymmetric temperature gradient.\nSeeding technique: We had been using the "Transient Seeding"\ntechnique as described in Section 4.2.1. This technique\nhad given us problems in overshooting the temperature as we\nhave already mentioned. The interface allows us to control the\ntemperature automatically so that the "Stationary Seeding" technique could be used. The procedure for the technique consists\n\nof:\n(a) Find melting point of melt. This is accomplished by\ndipping a seed into the melt and adjusting the temperature\nuntil the seed neither melts nor grows. A seed etched to\na point gives a more accurate melting point. Mote: Be sure\nthat the seed is clean. Once the m.p. has been found, it\nis best to check it by etching the seed and lowering it into\nthe melt again.\n\n93\n\nU E ED I1 U L L El?\n\n,05\n,07\n\n77.\n\n.Is5\n\nI 1 -1\t\n\n1\n\n\t-\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2ID\t\n\n`750\n\n- z3^p _\t\n\n--\n\n35Mrc..S7MMS cMEL\nLip \'E\n/if`\n\nTIM W( //IYL\n\nTAWPs SEED\n\nFigure 46.

Actually we used 5 - 101).\n\n(c)\n\nAs the melt temperature drops to the new value, a\nbutton begins to grow. When wings just first appear\npulling is commenced at 70% of speed controller (this\ncorresponds to 5 cm/min). As the button reaches the\nsurface of the melt, the speed controller is reduced\nalmost to zero and the temperature is raised to give a\n\nAT of from 2 -50.\nI:\n(d)\n\nAfter the web has solidified the pull rate is slowly\nincreased to the desired velocity for web growth\n(2 -5 cm/min.).\nTemperature and pull speeds are adjusted during the\npull as needed. Note: Changes should be small at\nany one time.\n\nWhen we first used the stationary seeding technique, the\n3. Pull rate:\t\npull rate after the button cleared the surface of the melt had\nbeen reduced to 10% rather than the "almost zero" given in (c)\nabove. This proved to be too fast, and it was not until we went\nto this "almost zero" rate until the web solidified did we get\nreproducable web from the ini*ial seed.\n4.2.4 Sustaining Web Growth\nThe goal for that phase of the work reported in Section 4.2.3 was to be\nable to grow good two dendrite web from the button grown initially on the\nseed and do so reproducibly. This goal was reached; however, we found a\nproblem in sustaining growth. Invariably the two dendrite web would pull\nfree from the melt or develop "thirds". The goals for the final phase of\nthe contract, then, was to study the problem of pull outs and thirds as\nwell as to study widening rates to get information on width and pull rates\nof web. To keep the number of parameters that we vary to a minimum, we set\nupon a standard furnace configuration so that all parameters except those\nthat pertain to the goals of this phase of the investigation were kept\nconstant.\nThe most promising furnace configuration was chosen from temperature profile\ndata and from observations of button formation, dendrite and web growth.\nThis configuration consisted of (a) the tapered molybdenum susceptor (TS.\nFigure 56) set on the alumina pedestal (Figure C-2 of Appendix CJ (b) since we -Found\nthat two top shields gave us no improvement, in fact if anything they hurt\nus, we standardized on one top shield made from 60 mil molybdenum, (c) no\nbottom shields, since they appeared not to be of any help with the TS\nsusceptor, (d) the 130 mm diameter quartz envelope, and (e) the r.f. coil\n15.24 cm in diameter that was made from 1/4" copper tubing (the coil\nheight = 9.53 cm). Although our studies indicated little effect of the\nsize of the silicon charge nn button formation and ribbon growth, a 150\ngram charge was :adopted at, the standard for this phase of the work.\n4.2.4.1 Mechanical Aspects\nPremature pull-out of the ribbon from the melt appears to become increasingly\n\n95\nmore of a problem as the width of the ribbons are increased. Several modifications were incorporated into the puller that helped considerably in\npreventing premature pull-out of the web. during these experiments it was\nfound that there was insufficient fine temperature control to enable the\noperator to reproducibly set melt temperatures from run to run, and during\nthe same run, with sufficient accuracy to carry out the experiments. A\nfine tuning, 10 turn, potentiometer was installed on the controller which\ngave the operator sufficient reproducible control enabling him to make\nmuch finer adjustments to the melt temperature during the run. An additional change which was of considerable help was the incorporation of\nan 8 inch drive wheel with a new quieter motor and a new gear box on the\nribbon take-up reel. This gave greater control on the pull rates over\nthe range of pull speeds found most appropriate for pulling the ribbons,\ni.e., 1-5 cros/min. The pull speeds attainable with the 3 inch drive wheel,\nwith a new motor and the 8 inch wheel with new motor and gear box are shown\nin Figure C\xe2\x80\xa2i of Appendix C. Some difficulty was encountered due to\nmechanical vibration introduced when the seed holder and take-up ribbons\nwere wound up onto the take-up reel. This was improved by fabrication\nof a slimmer seed holder and the addition of mechanical guides to feed the\nsteel tape onto the take-up reel. Other changes made were:\n\n1.\n\nAligned old motor and gear box.\n\n2.\n\nPut on new motor and controller and aligned carefully with\nold gear box.\n\n3.\n\nPut on new gear box with new motor.\n\n4.\n\nMade new aligning jig on chimney. This allows lateral movement\nof the tape to control lateral position in the slot rather than\nshifting reel which can cause jerking.\n\n5.\n\nMoved spindle so that 3\' takeup reel was firmly on spindle.\nTuned up 3\' reel.(It was warped slightly).\n\n6.\n\nPut stop on reel support to keep tape from wandering to right\nand rubbing against wheel which causes jerking. This guide\nis necessary when tape gets out of chimney.\n\n7.\n\nBeveled top and bottor. edges of seed holder to reduce sudden\nmovement when seed holder goes over fingers and also into\nchimney.\n\n8.\n\nMade a new thin seed holder.\n\n9.\n\nTried a new type tape - last 12" made up of 4" pieces held\ntogether by small ring - it didn\'t work.\n\n96\n\n10.\n\nWorked to smooth action of fingers.\n\n11.\n\nReduced gas flow to 35 cfh.\n\n12.\n\nTook reading on\n\nfrequency of vibrations\n\nin room and furnace.\n\n4.2.4.2 Thermal Aspects and Web Widening_\nWe mentioned at the start of this section that we standardized on a furnace\nconfiguration so that we could devote our time to shaping the isotherm in\nthe melt to set up conditions favorable to web widening. This required then\nmainly working with the top heat shield. In the last phase, Section 4.2.3,\nwe reported that more than one top heat shield actually hurt us in our\nwidening rates; thus our standardization on one heat shield. Very early\nin this phase we found that we did not need to have a bottom heat shield,\nespecially with the tapered susceptor; thus we stopped using one.\nThe last heat shield variation we had used in the previous phase was the\nLDBeXW. This had given too much cooling at the center. We decided to work\nfirst with a variation of this shield that was not as wide - namely, the LDBeW which had not been tried with the tapered susceptor (TS). The various shield\nand susceptor setups used in this phase are given in Table 11. Before using\nthe LDBeW with the TS, however, we used it with the straight sided susceptor (SS).\nThe results that we got with the LDBeW/SS setup were the same as before. The\nLDBeW/TS setup gave us our best results. The aspect ratios of the buttons\nwere better, i.e., more of the 1/2, 1/3 and higher as can be seen in Table 12.\nWe were, however, not getting the improvements in widening rates that we\ndesired. We then went to a short straight sided dog-bone (SSDB), Figure\nC-3 in Appendix C. This gave us good aspect ratios (see Table 12), our\nlongest web up to that time, and the widening rates seemed to be better;\nhowever, the length of the slot (see Figure C-3) limited the final width of\nthe web. Besides shaping the openings of the heat shield, the use of ports\nin the bottom of the susceptor affects the isotherms in the melt and may be\nused to encourage widening. In the first attempt 1/4" holes were cut in the\nsusceptor as shown in Figure 17. This susceptor was designated TSP. So that\nwe were seeing the effect of the ports only, a medium length straight slot\n(MSS, Figure C-4) was used. Growth in this setup was similar to growth in a\nsusceptor with no ports - indicating that the openings were too small. The\nports were opened to 3/8" diameter. The growth showed that the ports were\ngiving an effect. Later a susceptor was made with oval ports (3/8" x 1/2")\nTSPO, Figure 17). This size ports gave too much cooling and was abandoned.\nBefore studying the effects of shaped slotted heat shields, after heaters\n(AH, Figure 47) were used with MSS. These after heaters were not as tall nor\nas wide as the ones reported in Section 4.2.2. The effect of the after heaters\nwas questionable, and since they still gave bad Si0 build-up, they were set\naside.\nSinre we were not getting the desired widening effects with straight slotted\nshie;,is, we designed an opening that would give a gradual increase in\nwidth to each end; it was designated the "bowtie" (BT, Figure C-5). This\n\n97\n\nTable 11.

The\nchanges in widths and lengths of the opening in "dog bone" and "bow tie"\ntype openings are given in Table 11. By studying the aspect ratios\n(Table 12) and widening rates (Table D-6) in Appendix D. one can see that the\nafter heaters did not help in the widening rates. We do beiieve.that they will\nbe helpf=ul in the perfection of wide web - more work-should be done on this.\nLooking at the widening rate data, it can be seen that there is some correlation between the thickness of the web and the widening rate. As a rule\nthe thicker the web, the higher the widening rate. It seems quite obvious\nthat there must be a "trade-off" on the widening rate. Where that "tradeoff" is, our data does not allow us to say. We feel that rather than a\nlarge widening rate, (which is conducive to thirds), one should have a\nsmall sustained rate. In reality, seeding should be done using webs themselves as seeds. This was tried several times in this phase of the work.\nThe results were encouraging enough to warrant further studies.\n\n4.3 Growth of Primitive Dendrites\nDuring this phase of the investigation, primitive dendrites were grown to\ngive us a supply of various twin spacings, by dipping a seed into a supercooled melt. The seed may be any piece of silicon, single crystal, polycrystal,\nor a piece of dendrite. The idea is to have the melt so supercooled that\nrapid growth takes place on the seed in the form of growth mass. The growth\nbeing so rapid that growth mistakes are made in the form of many twin planes silicon has a strong tendancy for twinning. Many of these twins will be\nparallel, and some of these will be close enough together to allow the growth\nof primitive dendrites upon rapidly pulling the growth mass from the melt.\nThese primitive dendrites varying from an inch to several inches are then\nbroken off, and their twin spacings catalogued.\n\nOur first attempts to pull primitive dendrites involved the use of the wide\nstraight slotted heat shield (Figure 24). For this shield, all primitive\ngrowth masses were too large to get through the opening. A heat shield with\na large circular opening was made, Figure 48. With it we were able to pull\nlarge-growth masses. The growth masses contained approximately ten primitive\ndendrites. The data on the twin spacings measured from the various growth\nmasses are given in Table 13.\nFrom these, we chose two primitive dendrites, one whose two lamellae were\nalmost of equal width (311, 20 and one in which one lamella is much larger\nthan the other (8p, 2p). From these primitives, dendrites were grown for\nuse as seed materials. The effect of the twin plane spacing on buttons (ease\nof formation and growth), wings (ease of formation and growth), and webs\n(growth) were assessed. These studies showed that there was very little\ndifference in the as ect ratios of the buttons that were formed from seeds\nwith twin spacings (ar 8-2p; (b) 0.9-2 4 ; and (c) 3-2p. Originally it was\nthought that the more favorable twin spacing would have the bigger aspect\nratio (i.e. bigger refer, to the denominator). It was found, however, that\nthe 3-2u seeds caused a great deal of difficulty in seeding and as such are\nnot favorable. As far as ease of seeding is concerned the 8-2p and 0.9-2u\nseeds appeared to be similar, with the 8-2p seeds showing a slight "edge" on\nease of seeding. During the latter part of the next phase (Section 4.2.4)\nseeds with the 8-2p twin spacing were used in an attempt to encourage\n\n.\t\n\ns\n101\n\nD.\n\nFigure 48.

Letters refer to lamellae as shown in Table 33.\n\n103\n\nwidening of the web. It was Found, however, that when dendrites and web\nhaving the 8-2n twin spacings were pulled at speeds greater than 4 cm/min\nbranching occurred. Dendrites and web having the 0.9-2u spacing, on the\nother hand, could be pulled at rates exceeding 10 cm/min without branching.\nIt thus appears that the optimum spacing would be .9 to 211 for one lamella and\nbetween 3 and 8n for the second lamella. This would put the optimum possibly\nthe same as for Ge, although there is no reason to believe that they should\nbe the same.\n\n4.4 Sunnier Extension\nThe goals set for the next phase were:(1) to study the mechanical stability\nof web growth, and (2) to investigate the thermal conditions in the melt by\ncareful and extensive thermocouple probing.\n4.4.1 Mechanical and Thermal Stability: During all previous phases of this\nwork problems in the mechanical stability of our system were investigated\nas they arose and appropriate changes made. These have all been reported\nin the other sections of this report. Toward the end of the last phase, a\ncomplilation of the causes for termination of two-.dendrite web was made to\nguide our work in this phase. This is given in Table 14. As a result of this\nthe following aspects of the furnace were studied and changes made:\n\n1.\n\nThe mechanical vibrations present on the floor^Df the laboratory\nwere measured and compared with the vibration spectra on the\ngrowth table. Very low level, low frequency (=8 hz) was found\npresent throughout the room, i.e., on the floor and growth\ntable. The air-table vibration isolator on the growth table\nhad little or no effect on this low frequency vibration.\nThe vibration spectra observed on the table did not change\nduring actual pulling of dendritic-web ribbon. These\nresults indicate that the ripples frequently seen on molten\nsilicon surface do not originate from mechanical vibrations\nintroduced during the pulling.\n\n2.\n\nA new set of high and low control fingers for adjusting the\nribbon position in the crucible were fabricated and installed.\n\n3.\n\nReduced mechanical play in all finger controls on top furaace\nplate.\n\n4.\n\nDesigned and fabricated a new tape system.\n\nb\t\n\n104-\n\nTable 14.

(A protruding screw\nhead had caused breakage of a ribbon in the past as it was\nbeing wound onto the reel.)\n\n9.\n\nA support was fabricated and installed to keep the r.f. coil\nrigid and level.\n\n10.\n\nAn Uproved friction brake to keep a uniform tension on the\ncloth tape storage reel was designed and fabricated.\n\n11.\n\nA new base was designed and installed for the pedestal so that\nthe entire pedestal column and susceptor could be re-centered\neach time a new charge is introduced to the crucible. This\ninsured the placement of the charge in the thermal center of\nsymmetry for each run.\n\nlevel\n\nThe following items were performed in preparation to making improvements\nin the thermal stability of the growth facility:\n1.\n\nFabricated a new 6 1/2" diameter r.f. coil to allow greater\nlatitude in controlling the center of thermal symmetry in the\nmelt.\n\n2.\n\nThe pedestal support was re- machined\nsymmetry.\n\n3.\n\nPolished the ends of the alumina pedestal so that they were\nflat and parallel to permit better geometric symmetry.\n\n4.\n\nA gauge was designed and fabricated to check\nof the furnace components.\n\nto\n\ngive better geometric\n\nthe\n\ngeometric symmetry\n\n106\n\nThe following general changes were made in the system to improve reliability:\nI. A low Ar pressure warning buzzer was installed.\n2.\n\nImproved the electrical isolation of the generator filament transformers to reduce risk of generator breakdown.\n\n3.\n\nA new heat exchanger plate was installed on the generator cooling\nwater system to reduce the cooling water temperatures.\n\n4.4.2 Thermocouple Studies\nand 4.2.4 were taken\nThe thermocouple data reported in Sections 4 .2 .3\t\nby measuring directly the emf of the Pt - Pt 10% Rh thermocouple (TC) with\na digital microvoltmeter. With this set up, we encountered fluctuations\nof from 10 to 50 microvolts - and occasionally even higher. This of course\nlimited our accuracy since 12 microvolts equalled 1 degree. This accuracy\nwas, however, acceptable for those studies. In the present studies, we\nwanted to be able to measure accurately temperature differences of 1/2\xc2\xb0 or\nless. To get this accuracy it was necessary to eliminate or greatly reduce\nthe fluctuation and to use a voltage to buck-out all but a small amount of\nthe emf generated by the thermocouple. For temperature differences between\ntwo points of the melt, we could of course buck one TC against another. For\nindividual measurements, however, it was necessary to use an exceedingly\nstable DC voltage that could be varied. It was felt that the required stability of the voltage source could not be readily obtained from commercial\nD. C. power supplies. Thus a power supply was made from a 1 1/2 volt Hobby\nbattery with a large resistor and a 10 turn potentiometer in series as shown\nin Figure C-6. This proved to be exceedingly stable.\nThe original idea was to make five readings simultaneously at the center and\nat four spots symmetrically placed toward the edges of the melt. A special\nwater cooled top plate for the furnace was fabricated which contained appropriate openings for the thermocouple probes. A 4 channel Sanborn recorder was obtained for this purpose. This proved highly impractical,\nhowever, as a full scale of 12 to 36 microvolts was required to get the\ndesired accuracy. This meant that temperature differences of over 3 0 required either a scale change or a change in the bucking voltage. Either one\nadded too great an uncertainty in the readings. Next a Honeywell Electronik\n19 TC recorder along with a 5 position thermocouple switch was purchased from\nthe Omega Corporation in an effort to make the five readings sequentially\nand record them on one recorder. A box was constructed to hold the bucking\nvoltage source, connectors for the 5 thermocouples, and connectors for external monitoring. This, however, proved unmanageable in that each thermocouple required a different bucking voltage to keep it on the chart. We\nfound that the most accurate way was to use a single thermocouple,connected\ndirectly to the bucking power supply and the recorder, and move it to the\ndesired position in the melt. The Honeywell recorder was used exclusively\nafter the Sanborn continued to breakdown.\n\n107\n\nConsiderable difficulty had been experienced in what we thought was pick-up\nof the r.f. noise. Shields made from molybdenum tubing appeared to help.\nFrequency measurements of the noise showed, however, that it could not be\nr.f. We went to direct connection to reduce noise in our signal. At first\nwe were getting quite a bit of noise and "temperature" fluctuations. In an\neffort to reduce this, every conceivable thing that could remotely contribute\nto noise and "temperature" fluctuations was varied while the thermocouple\nwas at a set temperature. The items varied were:\n(a)\n\nArgon flow. Changing the flow between 25 and 50 cfh had no\neffect on either the noise or the temperature.\n\n(b)\n\nAir currents. The door was opened and closed, the hood exhaust\nfan, furnace exhaust fan, and air conditioner were turned off\nand on. None of these had any effect on the noise. The only\none of these to affect the temperature was opening and closing\nthe door. Opening the door caused an increase of approximately 1\xc2\xb0C.\n\n(c)\n\nR. F. pickup. The r.f. was turned off momentarily. Although\ntemperature dropped, the noise on the chart line did not\nchange.\n\n(d)\n\nConnections. All connections were examined and wires "wiggled".\nThose causing noise were tightened or remade until this case\nwas eliminated. It is still necessary to check these periodically.\nThe junction box was found to be a particularly bad source of contact noise. Since we had found that one thermocouple was best,\nwe eliminated the junction box and directly connected the thermocouple to the recorder. Omega type NMP miniature thermocouple\nconnectors were used. An Omega electronic ice point thermocouple\nconnector was tried but had no effect in eliminating noise,\n\nThe interface circuit that\n{e) Automatic temperature controller. \t\nconverts the signal from the automatic temperature controller\nto match the input required for the D.C. power supply, which\ncontrols the generator, was re-wired to reduce the fluctuation\nin its output. To see if the automatic controller and/or the\ninterface circuit might be causing the noise or "temperature"\nfluctuations, the following were done:\nM The furnace was manually controlled from the automatic\ncontrol panel (this operation went through the interface\ncircuit).\n(ii) The furnace was manually operated from the D.C. power\nsupply (i.e., the automatic control and the interface\ncircuit were disconnected). Analysis of the results\nshow,^d thi 4 neither the interface nor the automatic\ncor\' c6:9; were contributing to the noise or fluctuations.\n\nt^\t\n\n108\n\n(f)\n\nPosition of thermocouple in furnace. Temperatures were monitored\nat various positions and depths in the melt, and also in cavities\nin the susceptor. It was found that when the thermocouple was near\nthe surface (within 4 mm) or near the edges the noise increased.\nIt was also noiser when the thermocouples were placed in holes in\nthe lip of the susceptor.\n\n(g)\n\nShielding. In June before the preceding was done, it was felt\nthat shielding the thermocouple and all wires to the recorder\nwould be necessary. Molybdenum tubing was used to shield the\nthermocouple, all connectors were shielded as were the wires. When\nthese were first used, they appeared to help. After we had eliminated all possible source of noise, we found that shielding was not\nnecessary.\n\n(h)\n\nMotion of melt. We looked at the motion of the melt as a source\nof noise. The frequency of normal movement, however, did not\ncorrespond to the frequency of the noise. Also on days when there\nwas essentially no movement to the melt., there was little change in\nthe noise. There was one day when the motion of the melt became\nquite violent toward the end of the day. At that time, the noise\nhad increased to 1 - 1.4\xc2\xb0C.\n\nThese studies resulted in a recording with noise below .5\xc2\xb0C usuaally it\nwas around . 25\xc2\xb0C. With the coil at our pulling height (i.e., 2.5 mm above\nthe top of the heat shield) and the temperature at 1450 \xc2\xb0 C, according to the\noptical pyrometer, the temperature varied only + .6\xc2\xb0C, over a 15 minute\nperiod.\nStudies were then started on the probing. The tapered sided susceptor\n(TS) was used in conjunction with the dog - bone (LSDBN), Figure C-7, heat\nshield. The coil was moved horizontally, and the temperature was measured\nacross the slot. For measurements involving moving the coil in the x-y\nplane, the thermocouple or thermocouples are held stationary in the desired\nposition (positions) until all readings are taken for that particular position.\nThen if necessary the TC and / or the CP are changed to another position. This\nis continued until all desired positions have been measured. It was not\npossible to adjust the center of thermal symmetry. The left side was always\ncolder even though the coil - s almost against the glass on that side. It\nwas noticed that the lip of the left side had a chip in it. The next day\nthe susceptor was rotated 180 0 so that the chip was on the right side. It\nwas again not possible to adjust the center of thermal symmetry, only this\ntime the right side remained colder. A new tapered susceptor ( TS) was made.\nWhen this was used, it was possible to balance the thermal symmetry - see\nTable 15. A straight sided susceptor (SS) was also run with the dog-bone\nheal, shield, as shown \' n Table 16.

This data may be compared for the same\nheat shields on the TSP susceptor given in Table 19. For measurements\ninvolving moving the coil in the z direction, i.e., coil position (CP)\nchanges to observe temperature changes or time constants, the thermocouples\nare left at one place and readings taken until all of the planned CP\nchanges have been made. Then the thermocouples are moved to other spots\nin sequence and CP changes carried out. Extensive time constant data was\ntaken for vertical shifts in the coil for the three heat shields NSS, LSDBN,\nand NBT. The data is given in Table 20 for the TS susceptor and in Table 21\nfor the TSP susceptor. Comparing this data, one can see that the time constants for the furnace under automatic control is from 1 min to 1 min 30 sec.,\nand under manual control from 2 min to 4 min.\nAt the start of the last phase, Section 3.2.1.4, a 10 turn potentiometer\nwas installed in series with our controller. Twenty-six turns on the pot\ngave us a 1\xc2\xb0 change in temperature. With this set-up, we were able to "call\nfor" temperature changes of a fraction of a degree. There is no question that\nthis helped us immeasurably; what we did not know with any certainty was (a)\nhow faithful was the setting, i.e., when we called for a 1/4\xc2\xb0 change, did\nwe actually get 1/4\xc2\xb0? and (b) how reproducible was the setting, i.e., if we\nincreased the temperature 10 0 (260 turns) using only the pot and then decreased it back to the original setting, would it come back to the exact\ntemperature? With our TC set-up, we studied this by placing a TC in the\ncenter of the melt. The measurements were made at 15 0 above the melting\npoint - a necessary precaution to insure that growth does not take place\non the quartz protective tubing. Temperatures were varied 1/4, 1/2, 3/4,\n1,2, and 7 1 as if we were pulling web. The output of the TC was put onto\nthe strip chart recorder, and whenever a change was made, a time notation\nwas marked on the chart. The final resulting temperature and the time it\ntook to reach that temperature were read off of the strip chart. The data\nis given in Table 22. One can see that the temperature that we actually\nobtained and that which we "called for" are within 1/4 1 for changes up to\n2 0 and better than 1/2\xc2\xb0 for a change of 7 0 . The response times run around\n1.3 minutes as we had measured earlier. Numerous other data showed that by\nusing only the 10 turn pot - to make a change we could always come back to\nthe same temperature within 1/4 0 . Several times long term stability of the\ntemperature was investigated by leaving everything set on automatic control\nand continuously monitoring the TC output on the strip chart recorder. Table\n2.3 reports a 15 min run in which the temperature variation was + .6 0 with a\ntotal of .5 0 noise in the TC. Other runs showed a stability within + .6\xc2\xb0\nfor up to 2 hours. This data, in Table 22, was taken for the NSS/TS \xe2\x80\x94arrangement. Other pertinent data in noise, long runs, also manual control are\ngiven in Table 23. For example it can be seen that it takes 15 - 30 sec.\nbefore the TC responds to a 2-3 0 temp. change.\n\nS\t\n\nf\n\n113\n\nTable 18.\t\n\nHeat shield\n\nTHE TEMPERATURE CHANGE BY VERTICAL SHIFT OF COIL\nFOR TAPER SIDED SUSCEPTOR\n\nTop of Coil above\ntop of heat shield (mm).\n\nRelative Temperatures\n(\xc2\xb0C)\nCenter\n\nN S S 2 - - - - -- -- -\t -\t\n\n4.5\n3.5\n2.5\n1.5\n.5\nL S D B N - - ^ - -\t - ^\t -\t -\t - ^\t 3.5\n2.5\n1.5\n.5\nNBT .- - - - - - - -\t 4.5\n3.5\n2.5\n1.5\n.5\n\nEnd\n\n11.84\nI0.56\n9.28\n8.32\n7.36\n6.24\n4.00\n8.32\n8.80\n14.64\n12.96\nI0.56\n9.44\n8.80\n\n5.6\n4.16\n2.56\n2.24\n1.76\n12.48\n8.48\n14.4\n14.08\n8.32\n7.04\n5.28\n4.00\n1.60\n\nAT\n\n6.24\n6.4\n6.72\n6.08\n5.6\n6.24\n4.48\n6.08\n5.28\n6.32\n5.92\n5.28\n5.44\n7.2\n\n!Votes: 1.

We went up to 92.6v, this gave\n1479 0 a change of 18 0 . (15.2 0 on T.C.) to change 2 min. 40 sec. We\ndropped to 90.8v - 1464\xc2\xb0 (down 15\xc2\xb0) (15.2\xc2\xb0 on TC)in 3 min. 20 sec. The\ncoil was .44 cm above the top of the heat shield.\n\n1I9\n\nTemperature changes across the slot as a result of changes in the vertical\nposition of the coil such as those given in Tables 18 and 19 are plotted in\nthe Figures 50 through 56 for the various heat shield/susceptor combination\ngiven in Table 24. These can be compared with earlier data - see Figure\n34, Figure 40, and Figure 4I. Some of the data is plotted in a different\nway in Figures 57 and 58 namely as temperature versus depth below the surface of the melt at the center, and at one extremity of the heat shield\nopening. As one can see, the vertical gradients are of the type making\nit the coolest at the surface, intermediate at half, and hottest at the\nbottom - rather than one of the inverse or inversion type discussed in\nSection 4.2.3. A careful comparison of the curves in these figures shows\nthat for each heat shield the ports in the susceptor, TSP, havea slight\ncooling effect in the melt causing the T to be a few tenths of a degree\nbelow that for the susceptor with no ports, TS - see Table 24. The cooling\neffect of the ports is seen more strikingly in the curves themselves (compare\nFigures 50, 51, 53, and 54, and 55 and 56). The flattening out of the curves\nat the outer edggs. for the TSP is quite evident.\nBesides the difference in the curves caused by the different susceptors or\na given heat shield, one can also see a difference between the heat shields.\nReferring again to Table 24, it is seen that the long straight, narrow dogbone (LSDBN) heat shield gives the smallest temperature gradient across the\nslot (with the TS and TSP susceptors) while the NSS heat shield gives the\nlargest j radient. It should also be noticed that the straight sided susceptor (SS) gave a much higher temperature gradient across the LSDBN heat shield\nthan was found for either the TS or TSP susceptor. This larger gradient definitely suggests that the SS susceptor is not as favorable as the tapered\nones, contrary to the suggestion in the thermal modeling section 3.2.3 that\nthe SS susceptor should give wider web. We have at present no answer to this\napparent conflict.\n\nDetailed probing of the melt was carried out for the three heat shields on\nthe TSP susceptor. In addition the LSDBN shield was used with the SS\nsusceptor. We also included data we had taken previously for the LDBeW/SS\ncombination. The data was taken by rigidly holding the TC at one level with\na rubber "0" ring (11/64" thick). The TC was moved horizontally to each\nstation until all data at one level was taken, then another spacer was put\non and the process repeated until the entire melt had been probed. The data\nwas then plotted on a drawing of a crucible. The data for LDBeW/SS is found\nin Appendix C in Figure C-10; LSDBN/SS, Figure C-11; LSDBN/TSP, Figure C-12;\nNBT/TSP, Figure C-12; NSS/TSP, Figure C-14; and a more detailed probing of\nNSS/TSP in Figure C-15. In reality very little can be said of Figure C-10.\nThis was data taken earlier by reading the output of a TC on a digital voltmeter; it was included here to show the difference between the two techniques.\n\n\t\n\n120\n\na\n\n1,\n\n43\'\n\n/. 825" -..-"-\n\nIT\t\n.176"\n\n\tFigure\n\n\t\n\n49.\n\nNarrow bow-tie (NBT) heat\nshield.\n\n121 --.\n\n-2.35\t\n\n-1.09\t\n\n"0\t\n\n1.09\t\nX position in slot\n\n,.\t\n\nFigure 50\xe2\x80\xa2 Temperature across slot for straight slot.

The 1.SDDN heat shield was used in conjunction with the SS susceptor to compare it with the TSP data and to\nsee what the detailed TC probing could show. Figure C--11 shows that the\nisotherms in the bottom half of the melt are almost flat - a situation\nthat we reported to be the case earlier from other studies. At the time\nthat we standardized on the TS tusceptor for the final phase (see\nSection 4.2.4), we made the choice on our.studies that \'indicated we did\nnot want isothermal conditions on the bottom of the melt.\n\n5. Web Characterization\n5.1 Development of sampling strategy, prototype technique.\nWhile the key to crystal growth studies is characterization of the material,\nthe key to material characterization is careful sampling. Because of the\nuniformity of the material from the web growth process, one is not trying\nto get a scheme for truly random sampling with a large enough number of\nsamples to have statistical significance. Instead what is desired is to\ntake enough samples along the strip to catch any deviation or anamolous\nchanges in the structural and electrical properties of the material,\nbut not so many samples that material, time, and money are wasted.\nA strategy based on past experience with webs and solar cells, and in\nkeeping with the requirements of this contract was worked out in the first\nquarter. The growth button (or, in the case of direct seedling from a web,\nthe region of seeding) are separated from the seed and the rest of the\nlength of web, by careful scribing and fracturing perpendicular to the\ngrowth direction. A twelve inch length followed by two one inch lengths\nwere separated by fracturing. This was repeated down the entire length\nof the pull. Each piece was carefully identified as to its position from\nthe seed. The twelve inch pieces were stored. One of each of the one inch\npieces along with the seed sample were used for the structural characterization, and the other one inch piece for electrical characterization and\ntest solar cell fabrication. In case of pull:; less than two feet, the\nlonger lengths were reduced from twelve inches accordingly.\nThe graduate students had all been trained in the characterization techniques\nin their course work, and some of them had done these measurements on previous\ncontracts.\n\n132\n\nDuring the first quarter, no web was grown. The time was spent in designing\nand building special equipment necessary-for holding and preparing web samples\nfor measurements involving optical microscopy and transmission electron\nmicroscopy.\nMeasurement of twin spacings, thickness, density of dislocations running\ndown the web paralled to the two main faces, and spacing of twin lamellae\nbetween the main faces necessitate viewing the sample "end on" under an\noptical microscope. This requires very exacting alignment. Often it is\ndesired to tilt the sample approximately 20 0 to examine one of the {1111\nplanes on the fracture cross-section. The sample holder -itself shown\nin Appendix C, Figure C-16, was fabricated from a 1/4 inch diameter steel\nrod with one end machined flat and a wire spring attached so that the\nsample is held firmly against the flat. The rod is placed in a V cut in\na small block of steel that is affixed on one side of a steel plate cut to\nthe size of a microscope slide. A knob allows rotation of the sample.\nTransmission electron microscopy required samples one-eighth (1/8) inch in\ndiameter to fit on the standard electron microscope sample grids. The\nsamples must then be thinned to less than 2000 . A tool was designed and\nmade for the ultrasonic cutter to cut 1/8 inch diameter samples.\nThinning of such small samples for TEM requires jet etching. Jet etchers\nfor Si and Ge require special materials that can withstand HNO 3 and HF\nand also not introduce contamination. A jet etching apparatus was designed\nand constructed somewhat along the lines of several already reported in the\nliterature. The first design proved to be too critical in adjustment and\ngave very uneven etching. A second one was built.\nWith the new instrument and practice an operator can repeatedly produce\nsuccessfully etched samples. The active nature of the etchant is a constant\nworry, but immediate clean-up of the etcher after use minimizes part wear.\nParts that wear are the tip and the bottom cap of the nozzle which are made\nof quartz.\nThe following is a description of the etcher; a detailed etching operation\nprocedure is given in Appendix.D, Table D-7.\nAs depicted in Figure C-17 the nozzle body is made of teflon instead.of\nquartz. Since the CP4 etchant does not react with teflon, the problem of\nerosion is eliminated. The tip is made of a piece of quartz capillary\nwith an inside diameter of 1 nun. It is sealed to a holder which screws\ninto the nozzle body. The holder is also made of teflon. The etchant does\nerode the tip and the bottom cap. If care is taken in thoroughly cleaning\nthe nozzle after each etching operation, the tip and the bottom cap can last\nfor many operations.\n\n133\n\nExamination of the twin spacing using optical microscopy on fractured surfaces showed the twin spacing to be very narrow. Measurements were made but\nthe resolution of the optical microscope is about .S.Um; thus for one of the\nlamellae the narrower spacing could only be estimated. The SEM was used on\nthe fractured surfaces because of its higher resolution and great depth of\nfield. A special holder had to be made for these samples. The SEM method\nis slower than OM, but is essential for narrow spacings. Attem is were made\nto measure the twin spacing by REM {replica electron microscopy using a\ndirect carbon replica. The technique, however, provided no saving of time\nand was not as versatile.\nThe studies using the SEM showed for approximately a dozen different dendrites and webs that were grown in the first 6 weeks, that instead of three\ntwin planes we had 5. The spacing of the lamellae between the twin planes\nis 0.5, 0.2, 0.2 and 3 microns on the average as seen in Table 25. Two\nsamples did not show the 3 micron lamella; this, however, was presumably\ndue to poor fracturing. Two samples from a piece of web that was grown at\nWestinghouse prior to 1967 were examined by this technique. The results\nwere the same which is not too surprising since a piece of this material\nwas used as the initial seed.\nTable 13 shows the results of twin spacings measured on p rimitive dendrites\ngrown during this contract to evaluate the roll of the twin spacing in web\ngrowth; while Table 26 gives the twin spaicng os some of our seeds used in\nthe later phases.\nIn addition to the structural work, the electrical resistivities, from fourprobe measurements, were recorded on a number of the early dendritic-web\nsamples. This data along with the other physical characteristics of typical\nsamples produced during this contract are shown in Appendix D, Table D-8.\n\n6.

General agreement was found, however, as for\nexample. satisfactory pull rates for web growth was determined to be,\nboth theoretically and experimentally, in the range of 3-5 cm/min.

Susce ptor Geometry and Radial Temperature Gradients in the Melt.\nThe analytical treatment discussed in Section 3.2.3 indicates that between\nthe two types of susceptor used, straight sided (SS) and tapered (TS),\nthe tapered susceptor should give the greater radial temperature gradient.\nExperimental data (See Figures 52 and 53) taken with the two types of\nsusceptors and using a long straight narrow dog-bone (LSDBN) slotted top\nheat shield failed to support this however; and,in fact,the data gives\nthe opposite result. The discrepancy here is most probably due to the\ninadequacy of the analytical technique for handling the actual real thermal\nproblem. The thermal analysis was limited to two dimensions and was in-capable of including the effects of a slot in the top heat shield. It is\napparent from this that completely misleading results can occur from an\noversimplified analytical model.\nThe same type of discrepancy is seen to arise when one compares the effects\nof radiation ports on the temperature distribution within the melt. The\ntheoretical analysis, based on a model which does not include, adequately,\nthe effects of the slot in the top heat shield, gives results directly\nopposite to those obtained from experimental measurements. Compare Figures\n18 with Figures 53 and 54.\nFor the analytical treatments which included the slot geometry, agreement\nwith the experimental data was quite reasonable, see Figure 45 and Tables\n7 and 8.\n\n7. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nA. Web Growth\nFor web, or any sheet process, to be cost competitive with Czochralaski, it was\npointed out that the process must have the following capabilities (a) pull\nrate in excess of 5 cm/min, (b) yield wide sheets (at least 5 cm wide), (c) pull\nseveral sheets simultaneously from the same crucible, and (d) continuous growth\n(i.e., replenish the Si). It was shown that (a) appears to be obtainable\nalthough no value can be set as to how fast. No new definitive information\nwas obtained on (b); however, from the information obtained on thermal gradients\nand the length of opening in the top shield, it appears that 5 cm width is\npossible. There may, however, be a real problem in attaining both the width\nand pull rate goals together. More work must be done on the interaction between\nthe pull rate and the width.\n\n138\n\nIt was found in this investigation that the requirements on the mechanical\nand thermal stability were much stricter than had previously been thought.\nGreat care must be taken in the mechanical design and operation of a furnace\nfor pilot plants or production. All internal and external sources of vibration or jarring must be eliminated. Furthermore, the r.f. coil must be rigidly\nmounted not only to cut out vibration for the sake of mechanical stability but\nalso to help eliminate small temperature fluctuations which can cause premature pull-out. Exceedingly tight tolerance on the crucible\n\nspecifications\n\nmust be used - far tighter than usually given for quartz. These plus the\ndata on the isotherms make it very doubtful if multiple webs can be pulled\nfrom the same pot, (c).\nThe thermal probing data showed that it was possible to shape isotherms in\nthe melt to a variety of shapes. Thus it is possible to shape the isotherms\nin a manner that would allow continuous feeding to keep the melt level constant,\nGreat care must be exercised in the construction of the feed\nrequired by\nmechanism, however, to be sure that it can not become a source of vibration.\n\nM.\n\nThe studies on other twin spacings, showed that the 2P - 3u spacing was\ndifficult to seed, although once formed the dendrites and web gave no problem\nin continued growth. The 2n - 8P spacing seeded and grew well but had an\nupper limit of 4 cm/min on the pull rate; while the .9u - 2u spacing showed\nno upper limit (i.e., up to at ;east 10 cm/min). More work will be needed\nbefore one can say what the true optimum spacing is.\nWidening rates were found to be a function of 07(1/2 slot length) rather\nthan AT alone. High widening rates were found to be detrimental to good\ncrystal perfection. Thus it is recommended that widening rates be kept\nmoderate.\nSeveral thermal and mechanical changes made during this work helped\ngreatly in obtaining our goal of getting two dendrite webs to grow\nfrom buttons that were grown on the seeds. Three of these changes in\nprocedure should be mainly credited with the attainment of our goal.\n1. Changes in temperature and pull rate: We found that abrupt\nchanges of 1 0 or more in the temperature during pulling invariably led to the web falling free at the start or to the\nweb and edge dendrites pulling free at any time after the\nweb had solidified. This was especially true when we were\nusing the transient seeding technique. In a like manner\nabrupt increases in the pull rate led to the formation of\n"third" dendrites in the web portion or to the outside of\neither edge dendrite. The latter effect was enhanced if\nthe web was growing in an asymmetric temperature gradient.\n\n__\n\na\t\n\na\n\n139\n\n2. Seeding technique: We had been using the "Transient Seeding"Y\ntechnique as described in Section 4.2.1. This technique\nhad given us problems in overshooting the temperature as we\nhave already mentioned. The interface allows us to control\nthe temperature automatically so that the "Stationary Seed`^,g"\ntechnique could be used. The procedure for the technique\nconsists of:\n\n(a) Find melting point of melt. This is accomplished by dipping\na seed into the melt and adjusting the temperature until the seed\nneither melts nor grows. A seed etched to a point gives a more\naccurate melting point. Note: Be sure that the seed is clean.\nOnce the m.p. has been found, it is best to check it by etching\nthe seed and lowering it into the melt again.\n(b) Set desired AT on the temperature controller (can be anywhere\nfrom 2-25\xc2\xb0. Actually we used 5 - 100).\n(c) As the melt temperature drops to the new value, a button\nbegins to grow. When wings just first appear pulling is commenced at 70 q of speed controller (this corresponds to 5 cm/min).\nAs the button reaches the surface of the melt, the speed controller is reduced almost to zero and the temperature is raised\nto give a AT of from 2 -5\xc2\xb0.\n\n(d) After the web has solidified the pull rate is slowly increased\nto the desired velocity for web growth (2 -5 cm/min.).\nTemperature and pull speeds are adjusted during the pull as\nneeded. Note: Changes should be small at any one time.\n3. Pull rate: When we first used the stationary seeding technique, the\npull rate after the button cleared the surface of the melt had\nbeen reduced to 10% rather than the "almost zero" given in (c)\nabove. This proved to be too fast, and it was not until we went\nto this "almost zero" rate until the web solidified did we get\nreproducable web from the initial seed.\n\nThe 10-turn potentiomet ,p r to give fine control on setting temperatures was\nvital in our case. Any equipment set up by others must have similar capabilities. Furthermore sudden changes in temperature or pall rate must be\navoided. Temperature changes during growth should not exceed l\xc2\xb0 in 1 1/2\nmin; pull speed changes should not exceed .5 cm/min in a similar time, Also\nthe pulling set-up must have a clutch that gives instant start and stop.\n\n144\n\nIt is strongly recommended that a thermocouple with a suitable recorder and\nbucking voltage be used to determine (and correct for) the center of thermal\nsymmetry at the start of each melt. It was found that the symmetry of the\nbutton technique does not give the very fine positioning required for long\npulls.\nOf numerous heat shield/susceptor combinations that we Investigated, the\nbest resulted from using the long straight dog--bone slot with the narrow\nopening and the ported, tapered susceptor. More work should be done with\nthis especially with the inclusion of after heaters.\n\nB. Thermal Modeling\n(1) Furnace design parameters predicted to have a major role in\ndetermining the web pull rate are (1) thermal shield temperature,\n(2) spacing between the thermal shield and melt surface, and\n(3) thickness of the growing web. A decrease in the thermal\nshield temperature or a decrease in the spacing between the\nthermal shield and melt surface result in an increase in the\npull rate. In addition, the pull rate is predicted to increase\nas the thickness of the web decreases.\nThese studies indicate that growth is stable over a wide range of conditions.\nFor example, after a small increase in pull rate, equilibrium conditions\nwill again be reached with a thinner web. If the silicon is not replinished\nduring growth it will be necessary to decrease the growth rate as the level\nis decreased because of the increase in the spacing between the thermal\nshield and the melt surface.\nPredicted growth rates are approximately equal to experimental values. However,\ndetailed comparison between analytical and experimental results were not\nmade because experimental data is limited.\n(2) Temperature distributions calculated in the melt indicate that\nthe slot geometry has a significant effect on the temperature\ndistribution in the melt. A more uniform temperature is predicted for the dog-bone slot which is advantageous for webdendritic growth.\nTemperature distributions were obtained for two susceptor designs: a\ncylindrical shaped design and a tapered design with a lip at the top edge.\nResults show that the temperature gradients are smaller with the cylindrical\nshaped susceptor than with the tapered design. The temperature is predicted\nto decrease with depth with the tapered susceptor which should enhance\ngrowth of the dendrites.\n\n^r\n\n141\n\nThe effect of the radiation ports on the temperature distribution yielded\nunexpected results. The model predicted that the radiation ports have an\nextremely small effect on the temperature distribution. In addition, it\nVas predicted that the temperature of the melt in the region of the ports\nincreases rather than decreases as had been anticipated. Temperature\nmeasurements taken in the melt apparently contradict the analytical results\nhowever. The analytical model is subject to inaccurcies which may have\nresulted in the discrepancy.\nRecommendation\n\nFurther analytical and experimental work is recommended to unJarstand the\nheat and mass transport in the region of the liquid-solid interface. Methods\nof increasing the heat loss from the interface should be investigated. The\nuse of externally cooled radiation shields to reduce the radiation received\nby the web and meniscus from the thermal shield and melt surface is one\nconceivable means of obtaining increased pull rate.\n\nI\n\ni\t\n\n\t\n\n142\t\n\n8.\n1.\n\nJ\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFaust, Jr, J.W. and H.

The\nthermal shield is a circular molybdenum disk and is maintained near tte\nsilicon melt temperature by radiation exchanged with the melt and susceptor\nand by induction heating. Thermal radiation is emitted front the top surface\nof the thermal shield to the surroundings. Some of this radiation strikes\nthe web surface where a portion is absorbed. Tile irradiation of the web\nby the thermal shield is the only significant source of radiation because\nother surrounding surfaces are at relatively low temperature. Thus, the\nirradiation, H, of the websurface area above the thermal shield is due\nto radiation exchange with the thermal shield.\nEach side of the web receives radiation from a semi-circular section of the\nthermal shield. The thermal shield and web surfaces are assumed gray and\ndiffuse and radiation received from the surrounding surfaces is neglected.\nOnly the radiation emitted by the thermal shield and reaching web surface\nis included; thus, radiation which reaches the web surface by reflection\nbetween the two surfaces is neglected.\nThe irradiation H of the web surface is the thermal radiation emitted by\nthe thermal shield which strikes the web. It is apparent from an examination\nof Figure 1-1 that the irradiation of the web surface is higher near the\nthermal shield than at distances above the thermal shield.\nFigure I-2 shows an element of area dA ? on the web surface which receives\nradiation from an element dA l on the thermal shield.\t\nFront\n\t the\nradiation heat transfer rate front\n\t and dA2 is given by\ndg dA l - dA2 = W1dAIdFdAl - dA 2\t(1)\nwhere W 1 is the emissive power of dA l and dFdAdA\t\nis the fraction of\n2\nthe radiation emission front\n\t which strikes dA 2 or the angle factor.\nThe area dA 2 is located on the centerline of the web at a distance X above\nthe thermal shield surface. The irradiation of the web surface is slightly\nhigher along the centerline of the web than at its edges. The irradiation\n\n1. Gebhart, B., Heat Transfer, McGraw-Hill, N.

Thl thermal shield is normally approximately\nuniform in temperature and therefore W l is approximately constant. Integrating Equation (3) over A l we obtain,\n\nH -- W1\n\nI\n\ndFdA -dA \t(4)\n2\n. 1\n\nl\nThe right hand side of Equation (4) isthe fraction of radiation emitted\n-A1 and can be written Ell,\nby dA2 that strikes Al and is denoted by F\ndA\n2\ncos ^1 cos ^2\ndAl (5)\ndFdA2-dAl --\t\nr2\t\nd dA2-A1 -\t\nA l\t\n\nAl\n\nwhere the variables contained in Equation (5) are shown in Figure I-2.\nthe angles ^ and ^2 are the angles between the normal to the areas dA\nand dA2 and the line joining the two areas and r is the distance between\nthe areas.\nEquation (5) can be integrated by substituting the polar coordinates\n(p, e) in the plane of A l as shown in Figure I--2. The radius is the\ndistance from the center of the thermal shield to dA and a is the angle\nmeasured from the plane of the ribbon. Area dA l in erms of\'these\ncoordinates becomes\ndAl = pdodp\t\n\n1.\t\n\nIbid\n\n(6)\n\n\t\n\n147\n\nThe following additional relations can be obtained,\n(7)\n\nr 2 =p 2 ^.

It would seem that the value of F \t\nshould be 0.5\nat X = 0 which is the value obtained from Equation dA 2 `A l (11). Thus, it is\nseen that Equation (11) yields correct values at these two points.\n\n148\na\n\nAppendix B.

(Use toluene as\nsolvent.)\nPosition the sample above the nozzle tip. The distance between\nthe sample and the tip should be approximately 3 mm.\nPlace the top on the etcher. Assure that the sample can be observed from the viewing mirror.\nAdjust the bottom of the etchant reservoir to a level approximately\n5 cm above the nozzle tip.\nMix CP4 etchant. (To etch a 10 mil silicon sample, use 27 cc. HF +\n123 c.c. HNO3).\nTurn on rinse jet water.\nTurn on the etcher light.\nTurn off the room light.\nPour etchant into the reservoir.\nWhen a dim red light is observed in the viewing mirro, reposition\nthe sample holder so that the sample is directly above the rinse\njet.\nTurn on the room light.\nDecant the residual etchant from the reservoor into a plastic\nbeaker.\nDisconnect the tubing from the reservoir to release the remaining\netchant into the beaker.\nStop the rinse jet water.\nRemove the sample holder and rinse it in water.\nDisconnect tubing from the rinse jet.\nRemove tubing from the drain reservoir.\nRinse the etcher with tap water.\nUnscrew the nozzle tip holder from the nozzle body and rinse both\nparts thoroughly with water.\nRemove the sample from the holder. (Dissolve wax in toluene.)\nRinse the sample in acetone.\n\nr1\n\n9\t\n\ni\n\n176\n\nTable D-8.
