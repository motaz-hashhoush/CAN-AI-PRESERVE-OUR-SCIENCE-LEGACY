An enzyme that oxidizes IAA to a nongrowth-promoting species has been partially purified, and determined to be stimulated by a lipoidal factor. Data suggest that the upward transport of IAA in the stele and outward movement from the stele into the mesophyll cortex is metabolically mediated, and possibly affected by the gravitational stimulus. It is postulated that hormone assymmetries can arise by 'potential-gating' of the transport channels between the various plant tissues.", "title": "An attempt to localize and identify the gravity sensing mechanism of plants", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T19:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860045679, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bandurski, R.
