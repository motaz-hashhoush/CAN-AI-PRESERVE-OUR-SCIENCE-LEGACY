b'Software\nMIRO Computational\nModel\nA computational model calculates the\nexcitation of water rotational levels and\nemission-line spectra in a cometary\ncoma with applications for the Microwave Instrument for Rosetta Orbiter\n(MIRO). MIRO is a millimeter-submillimeter spectrometer that will be used to\nstudy the nature of cometary nuclei, the\nphysical processes of outgassing, and the\nformation of the head region of a comet\n(coma). The computational model is a\nmeans to interpret the data measured by\nMIRO.\nThe model is based on the accelerated\nMonte Carlo method, which performs a\nrandom angular, spatial, and frequency\nsampling of the radiation field to calculate the local average intensity of the\nfield. With the model, the water rotational level populations in the cometary\ncoma and the line profiles for the emission from the water molecules as a function of cometary parameters (such as\noutgassing rate, gas temperature, and\ngas and electron density) and observation parameters (such as distance to the\ncomet and beam width) are calculated.\nThis work was done by Paul A.

The foundation\nplatform for GRAPE provides a number\nof communication and data-management mechanisms, which help planners\ncommunicate scheduling issues, including document management, security\nschemes, calendars, wikis, blogs, lists,\nissue tracking, discussion forums, workflow management, alerts/notifications,\nand configuration management.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nAdditionally, a set of \xe2\x80\x9cweb parts\xe2\x80\x9d has\nbeen developed for DSN resource-allocation-specific analysis, including tools\nfor managing ground asset and mission\ninformation; finding configuration\ncodes; displaying, querying, and comparing schedules; analyzing mission coverage; checking for schedule conflicts;\ncreating and submitting schedule\nchange requests; and viewing and validating mission view periods. The\nmethodology of web parts allows individual users to compose their own Web\npages by picking the web parts they want\nto use on a Web page, rather than developers designing Web pages for users.\nThis allows developers to focus more on\nfunctionality and less on appearance\nand integration, while users are empowered to compose Web pages for their immediate analysis and collaboration\nneeds rather than waiting for another\nlong development cycle for some new\ncapability. GRAPE web parts, which connect to existing DSN middle-tier Web\nservices for many computation and data\naccess activities, support Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and component-style development.\nThis work was done by Yeou-Fang Wang,\nMitchell Schrock, John R.

MIRO will study\nthe evolution of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko\xe2\x80\x99s coma system. The\ninstrument will measure surface temperature, gas-production rates and relative abundances, and velocity and excitation temperatures of each species\nalong with their spatial temporal variability. This software will use these measurements to improve the understanding\nof coma dynamics.\nThe modeling tool solves the equation of motion of a dust particle, the en-\n\nergy balance equation of the dust particle, the continuity equation for the dust\nand gas flow, and the dust and gas mixture energy equation. By solving these\nequations numerically, the software calculates the temperature and velocity of\ngas and dust as a function of time for a\ngiven initial gas and dust production\nrate, and a dust characteristic parameter that measures the ability of a dust\nparticle to adjust its velocity to the local\ngas velocity.\nThe software is written in a modular\nmanner, thereby allowing the addition\nof more dynamics equations as needed.\nAll of the numerical algorithms are\nadded in-house and no third-party libraries are used.\nThis work was done by Paul A. Von Allmen\nand Seungwon Lee of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The term \xe2\x80\x9cgoal\xe2\x80\x9d\nrefers to a science or engineering request to execute a possibly complex\ncommand sequence, such as image targets or ground-station downlinks.\nDeveloped as an extension to the Virtual Machine Language (VML) execution system, the software enables onboard and remote goal triggering\nthrough the use of an embedded, dynamic goal set that can oversubscribe\nresources. From the set of conflicting\ngoals, a subset must be chosen that maximizes a given quality metric, which in\nthis case is strict priority selection. A\ngoal can never be preempted by a lower\npriority goal, and high-level goals can be\nadded, removed, or updated at any\ntime, and the \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d goals will be selected for execution.\nThe software addresses the issue of\nre-planning that must be performed in\na short time frame by the embedded\nsystem where computational resources\nare constrained. In particular, the algorithm addresses problems with welldefined goal requests without temporal flexibility that oversubscribes\n\n15\n\n'
