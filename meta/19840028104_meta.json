In such cases as that of multipass aerobraking, in which the vehicle is transferred from its approach velocity to a highly elliptic orbit about the planet by means of a rocket burn, followed by the circularization of the orbit through many high altitude atmospheric passes, the technology appears to be ready for application. In most other areas of aeroassisted orbit transfer, further work is required to reduce design risks to acceptable levels.", "title": "Aeroassisted orbit transfer window opens on missions", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T01:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840028104, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Walberg, G.
