Tectonic3 in the Taiwan Strait behind the collision zone.\nTaiwan is known to be the product of collision between the\nPhilippine plate and the Asian plate. This collision is strong\nenough that its effect is felt in the Taiwan Strait and most\nprobably across the Strait in Southeast China.\nIn the Strait young normal faulting striking nearly perpendicular\nto the trend of the Island is found.\nIn Southeast China, young basins bounded by NW striking normal\nfaults started their existence in late Pliocene when Taiwan began\nto rise out of the ocean.\n**** A partially completed manuscript is attached *****\n\nIII. Tectonics of Altyn Tagh Fault in n3rthwest China. Altyn\nTagh is a major fault bounding the northern edge of the Tibetan\nPlateau. The main branch has a length of about 1500 km. The\neastern end of the fault is evidently left-lateral from stream\noffsets (Allen, 1981; Molnar and Tapponier, ).\nBy correlating with the 1:4,000,000 geology map of China, we are\nable to identify the stratigraphic units correspond to most of\nthe major features on the 1:750:000 LANDSAT false color images\nmade with funds from this grant. By correlating a geological\nunit that appears on both sides of the fault, we estimate that\nthe maximum displacement is on the order of 300 km.\nThere are a number of faults around the main branch. In ge-pral\nthe formation of rhomboidal basins and the presence of push-ups\nat bends around the bends of the main branch along the part east\nof 82 east longitude are consistent with a left-lateral motion.\nHowever, near 80 east longitude the motion becomes dominantly\ncompressional as shown by the presence of high ranges. Further\nto the west, the motion becomes right lateral.\nj\t\n\nIt is interesting that in the western part of the Tarim basin,\ndirectly north of the area where Altyn Tagh fault becomes\n\ncompressional, there is a major thrust in the Basin that is on\ntop of a bulge under the basin. There some Late Paleozoic rocks,\nprobably part of the basement of the Basin, is actually exposed.\nThis structure in the middle of the Basin results evidently from\nthe collision of Indian and the Asian plates.\n**^* Xerox copies c; the LANDSAT images and their *****\n*****\ninterpretations are attached\t\n****\t\n\n1\n\n\t\n\n^f\n\na1\nI\n\nThe Tanlu Fault of Eastern China\n\n\t\n\nBy\nFrancis T. Wu\nDepartment of Geological Sciences\nState University of New York\nBinghamton, New York 13901\n\nZhang Yuming, Fang Zhongjing and Zhang Shiliang\nInstitute of Geology\nState Seismological Bureau\nBeijing, China\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic, there had been a\nnotable change in the tectonics of Eastern China, most probably\ndue to the impingement of India on Asian Continent and the\nsubouction activities on the western side of the Pacific plate.\nThe present Tanlu fault, cutting across much of China, was\npossibly the locus of tectonic activities since later PreCambrian.\nBut the fault-controlled features are much clearer in the\nPost-Cretaceous rocks. With the occurrence of ma,or earthquakes\nalong this fault, the clear Quarternar ,, geomorphic development,\t\nr\n\nand the continuous occurrence of microearthquakes here, this is\nevidently a mojor structure in Eastern China.\n\t\n\nIl\n1\n\nThe fault was not "discovered" until the late 1950\'s (Ministry of\nGeology, 1957; Xu, 1957). In the 1970\'s it became the center of\nattention in the study of the tectonics of Eastern China (Fang, \t\ni\n\nt^\n\nb\xe2\x80\xa2 \'.\t\ni\n\n1979; Fang et al., 1979; Huang, 1977; Xu, 1980). But there are\nstill many unsolved problems concerning the fault. The exact\n\nbe nature of its past activities, its extension to the north and the\nsouth and the total amount of displacement are all problems under\ncontinuous research.\n\nThis report provides an outline of the knowledge concerning this\nfault.\n\nLocation and Genera Geology\n\nThe geology of North China is markedly different from that of\nSouth China in several ways. It has long been for example that\nNorth China (Fig. 1) has a rather continuous sedimentary series\nprior to mid-Ordovician. Essentially no Devonian and Silurian\nrocks can be found there. The Sinian (PreCambrian) strata are\ncommonly very extensive ar.d thick limestone beds. And after\nmid-Ordovician scattere.l continental strata were formed. In\ncontrast, the equivalent Sinian beds are mainly silty sandstones\nin South China. And Cambrian and Ordovian strata in South China\nwere somewhat intermittent and from Silurian onward the\nnear-shore deposits were laid down; only after Triassic did the\nmarine sedimentation stop and replaced by sporadic continental\nsedimentation.\n\nThe section of the fault that has been studied in detail extends\nfrom the Bohai Gulf in Shantung Province to the eastern end of\nthe Dabie Mountains in Anhui Province (Fig. 1) for a length of\n1300km. Tl, e northern half of this section lies within North\nChina, but the South China block wraps around the southern end of\n\nJ\n\nthe fault. The fault evidently continues northward; it\neastern boundary of the broad Northeastern China Plain i\nLiaoniag, Jiling and Heilungjiang (Fig. 1). Northward, there is\na major fault that seems to link up with the Tanlu fault from\nAmur to the Okhotsk Sea according to available Russian reports().\nIts southern extension is much more problematical, a number of\ntectonic interpretations (e.g.,Tectonic Map of China, 1980)\ndepicts the fault as continuing across the Changjiang (Yantze\nRiver), through the South China block to end up in Gulf of\nTonkin; however, this interpretation is nct accepted by all.\nThus the probable total length of the fault from Anhui Province\nto Okhotsk Sea is on the order of 2500 km.\n\nMaximum Left-lateral Displacement Alo- \xe2\x96\xbag Tanli Fault\n\nBecause of the fact that the area has been uplifted above the sea\nlevel since late Paleozoic and the continental sedimentary cover\neither stripped from time to time or never had existed, it is\ndifficult to piece together a complete story as is the case with\nthe San Andreas fault. Such reconstruction has been attempted by\nXu (1979 for example) ; but the correlation of strata across the\nfault is never certain and therefore the conclusion that the\nleft-lateral movement of 700 km might have taken place during the\nMesoLoic has been subjected to much discussion (Fang et al.,1979;\nWu et al., 1981 among others).\n\nThat Tanlu is an old boundary is clearly shown by the fact that\nthe rocks on two sides of the fault in North China are not\ncorrelatable even allowing major horizontal movementR. Thus the\n\nDabie metamaorphics near the southern end of the fault is butting\nagainst rocks of the "South China Platform", and the Archaen\nrocks of western Shandong are compositionally different from the\nmetamurphics in eastern Shandong. The post Mesozoic sedimentary \t\n\nI\n\nbasin in eastern Shandong have not counterpa,Ls in western\nShandong. But whether we could define this generalized boundary\nto have always been the Tanlu fault is questionable. As shown by \t\nMcElhinny et al. (1982) that during Permian the North China block\nand the South China block may+ be totally apart and both were near\nthe equator.\n\nThe existence of the Tanlu fault in North China since Mesozoic is\ncertain. It is marked by the presence of two clear narrow\nvalleys in which very characteristic Late Jurrassic and early\nCretaceous strata were found. These arr: conglomeratic sandstones\nand coarse sandstones. The presence of these rift valleys\nimplies tensile stresses normal to the fault.\n\nThe left \xe2\x80\x94 lateral movement has taken place is supported by\nseveral geological observations. The Dabie metamorphic complex\nfor example is very very characteristic in the region. It is\nmainly found along the trend of the Dabie Mountains. However,\nit is found strewn along the Tanlu fault in Central A.-ihui\nProvince. The farthest distance wheLe the Dabie Mountain complex\nis found is about 200 km from the Dabie site. Actually,\n\nNeotectonics and Seismicity\n\nNeotectonic feature along portions of the Tanlu fault is very\n\n!\n\nin\n\nclear. Figures x-x show typical outcrop along the ShandongJiangsu section of the fault. This is also the location\nsuposedly of the 1686 M-8 earthquake.\n\nFig. shows typical outcrops of the fault in Shandong Province\nnear the _own of Juxian. Left-lateral stream offsets amount to\n20 m can be seen\n\no1 the ground and in the airphotos. Some\n\nthrusting is also evident in some outcrops (Fig. ).\n\nThe maximum right-lateral displacement that can be conjectured is\nabout 25 km from tre offset of one of the old Yellow River\nchannels that crossed the fault in Jiangsu Province near the town\nof Shuqian (Fig. ).\n\nThe effect of the ria`.c-lateral displacement is also clearly\ndisplayed by the post-Cenozoic deep graben east of the Dabie\nMountain, along the Yantze River.\n\nConclusion\n\n-- A major fault zone that extends from Dabie Mountains in Anhui\nProvince in ee.stern China to the Bohai Gulf and then onto Amur\nRiver Valley in Siberia and disappears in the Okhotsk Sea.\n\n-- The recent motion is definitely right-lateral from field\nevidence of stream offsets and focal mechanisms of small\nearthquakes along the fault.

Wu, State University of New York at Binghamton, N.Y.,\nUSA\nC. C. Biq, Centeal Geological Survey, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC\nIntroduction\nTaiwan is situated in the Western Pacific in between the Ryukyus\nand Lhe Philippines. As it has been pointed out by many authors\nthat Taiwan, unlike its island nei.ghborsin the Ryukyus and the\nPhilippines, is in a collision regime (see for example, Biq,1971;\nChai, 1972; Wu, 1978;Bowin et al., 1978; Lin and Tsai, 1982). It\nis a rather young collision; the high (3000-4000m) range q formed\nfrom Paleogene and Neogene sediments along the axis of the\nisland, recent seismicity, and the rapid modern day uplifting of\nthe marine terraces all &test to the vigor of this young\ncollision process. Even with sach a young geological phenomenon,\nhowever, there are still disagreements among the geologists and\nthe geophysicists as to the location of the suture line, the\nconfiguration of the plate boundaries and the detailed\ninterpretation of the tectonic environment before the collision.\nMuch new geological and seismological data have come into\nexistence in the last ten years and further refinement in the\ntectonic picture of Taiwan based on these data is useful in our\nunderstanding of mountain-building processes in general.\n\nI\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\ni\t\n\nMuch of the plains and the foothills areas have been mapped on\n1:25,000 scale cnd drilling as well as geophysical profiling have\nbeen done through petroleum exploration works. However, the\nMountainous areas, oue to the inaccessibility and the lack of\neasily identifiable horizons, have not yet been studied in great\ndetail; the main features are known but the boundaries of units\nare subjected to change as more work is done there. The gerLogy\nof the eastern part of the Taiwan Strait has been studied\nt"ioroghly by the Petroleum Company on Taiwan, but only one\nreport has been published (Sun, 1982).\n\n\'\t\n\nIt is not uncommon to apply the classic geosyncline theory to the\nstudy of tectonics of Taiwan (see discussions in Ho, 1982) and\nthis interpretation is sometimes pitted against the plate\ntectonic interpretation. Actually, being a very young tectonic\n\nVI\n\nbelt, Taiwan is an ideal place to study some of the details of\nmountain building processes; the sedimentary record is relatively\ncomplete and the forces that caused the mountains to rise are\np robably still at work.\nThis paper is directed at the (1) interpretation of parts of the\nsedimentary record in terms of our knowledge of the recent\npassive margin and the deformation in the forearc area, (2) a\nfurther look at the seismicity through stereoscopic diagrams and\n(3) interpretation of structures in the Taiwan strait and across\nthe strait on the mainland side as a consequence of collision of\nthe Ph!\'.ippine Plate with the Eurasian Plate in Taiwan.\nGeological Environment\nReviews of the geology of Taiwan can be found in Ho(1982),\nBig(1984) and others. Since most of the papers on the geology\nthere are not widely available outside of Taiwan, we shall\nsummarize here the pertinent geological data germaine to our\ndiscussions.\nGeographically, Taiwan can be divi,\'ed into four distinctive\nsub-areas along nearly north-south lines. A narrow Longitudinal\nValley divides the main part of the island from the Coastal\nRanges on the east. These are wages of about 1000 m in \t\nelevation and ringed on the east side, facing the Pacific, with\nraised marine terraces. To the west of Valley, the land slopes\nrapidly upward iato the Central Mountains. Within a distance of\nabout 30 km, the main ridge, much of it above 3000m, is reached,\nand the highest peak on the ridge has an elevation approaching\n4000m. The Central Mountains grade into the Foothills to the\nwest and then to the flood plain. The Taiwan Strait between the\nisland and the Chinese Mainland is fairly shallow at an average\ndepth of 20 meters; the depth increases rather rapidly south of\nthe Pescadores, a group of basaltic islands.\nThe oldest rocks in Taiwan are exposed on the eastern side of the\nCentral Mountains. These include shists, gneisses, metamorphosed\nlimestone and amphibolites. The parent rocks of these\nmetamorphic rocks are limestones, clastic sediments and igneous\nrocks. Greenschist, serpentinite and amphibolite bodies in the\neastern part of this belt have been recently studied by Ernst et\nal.(1981) and Liou(1981) among others. The ages of these\nmetamorphic rocks is certainly pre-Tertiary, but the their ages\nhave not yet been accurately determined. Based on available\n\ni\n\ndata, the oldest rocks have an age of 86 m.y.(Yen.\t\n). But a\nfew deformed amonites found in these rocks place them in Permian.\nOf course it should be pointed out here that at Permian time, the\narea in q uestion could have beer in an y ntirely differert place\nand it has since drifted (McElhinny, 1981) for \' Stances up to\n3000 ka to reach the present location. These rocks most probably\nform the basement of tht northern part of the main Island.\nOverlain the metamorphic basement are the thick slightly\nmetamorphosed marine argillacco\xe2\x80\xa2a sediments that form the high\nridges o\xc2\xb0 the Central MouAtains and their western flank. The\nmetamorphic grades of rocks in this belt increases generally from\nwest to east. They are Eocene to Miocene in age. It is common\npractice to discuss the geology of the Island in term of a\neast-wear profile. But there are significant north-south\ndifferences, and these argillaceous rocks demonstrate this well.\nIn the north, this Tertiary indtirated to metamorphosed argillite\nbelt consists of actually two belts, the western belt includes\nsandstone members and carbonaceous layers and interbedded\nbasaltic flows, tuffaceous sediments and so on. But thj eastern\nbelt contains limestone or marly intecbeds and -:nri:ular\nconglomerate beds, althosgh these are of limited occurrecice. In\nthe south, unly the the argillaceous strata are found; they are\njudged to be of similar nature as the eastern belt in northern\nTaiwan. The boundary between the north and south sub-provinces\nit marked on the map, but due to the lack of work in that area,\nthe exact location is frc from certain. It is interesting to\nobserve that the boundaries of the eastern argillite belt in\nnorthern Taiwan fullows the faults well, but the internal\nboundaries of the w-stern belt inters(ct the western limit of the\nbelt. These rocks do not appear in southern Taiwan, but the\nbasement rocks under the Coastal Plain are perhaps the extensior\nof these units (Chiu, 1975). In the south, the Eoceno slate also\nis found to the east of the Pre-Tertiary metamorphic rocks west\nof the Longitudinal Valley.\nThe mechanically incompetent rocks in the eastern slate belt is\nseverely faulted and folded with extensive development of slaty\ncleavage. The fold axes trend in the north-northeast direction.\nThe rocks in the western belt however are markedly lees deformed.\nThat these two sedimentologically and structurally different rock\nunits are juxtaposed means that the eastern belt was probably\nplaced there after significant horizontal displacement and that\nthe boundary is probably a fault, the Lishan fault, alt1i-ugh the\n).\nexistence of this fault is not undisputed(Chen,\t\n\n0\n\nM\n\nTo the west of the Central Mountains, a suite of Middle Miocene\nto early Pliocene shallow marine to shelf-elastics form the bulk\nof the foothills. Alternating sandstone and shaly layers\ndominate. In general the sediments contains more fine muddy\nmatrix as one goes south and the strata are much thicker. Lenses\nof tuffaceous rocks, resulting from submarine pyroclastic\neruptions of basalt, are present. The total thickness of the\nsedimentary rock reach 8000m to the east and decreases to less\nthan 1000m in the west. In northern Taiwan, there are several\ncoal-bearing layers; these are absent in the south, and the rocks\ncontain a high proportion of mud. There is a drastic increase in\nthe thickness of late Miocene to Pliocene strata south of 23.5\nlatitude (Ho, 1981), marking probably the position of the\ncontnental margin before the collision.\nThe eastern edge of the Coastal Plain is festooned by a chain of\nterraces formed from sandstones/shale and conglomerates. These\nPleistocene to Holocene deposits represent tectonic molasse.\nDetailed studies of sedimentary structures reveal that while the\nsediments deposited prior to late Pliocene were supplied from\nsources to the west, those after that period were supplied by\nsources to the east(Chou, 1973).\nThe rocks in the Coastal Ranges on the eastern side of the island\nare quite distinctive from those on the rest of the island. The\noldest rocks that crop out Miocene volcanics, mainly andesitic\nflows and pyroclastics. One magmatic suite seems to be an old\neruptive center to the two islands, Lutao and Lanhsu off-shore to\nthe southeast (Figure ). Indeed, this center appears to line up\nwith the two islands along an undersea ridge (figure ),\nindicating perhaps that at one time they were all active and had\nthe same role in the tectonic regime. A layer of agglomerates,\ntuff, and tuffaceous sediments underlies much of the Coastal\nRange, in the north and the south; the age of these rocks range\nfrom early Miocene to Miocene/Pliocene as determined from\nnanofossils and planktons contained in the limestone lenses\noccuring near the top of the formation.\nGeology of the Taiwan Strait is not yet well-known. The\npetroleum exploration in the eastern half of the Strait has\nproduced detailed seismic and drilling data. However, so far\nonly very generalized cross sections have been published (Sun,\n1^ \'). According to Sun, widespread unconformity exists between\nEocene and Oligocene and between Pliocene and Pleistocene strata.\n\nThroughout Tertiary, several basins can be identified with local\nridges separating the basins from each other. Growth faults have\nalso been found to accompany the deposition. Major faults are\nsub-parallel to the zxis of the present Taiwan while the recent\nnormal faults are often nearly east-west in orientation. The\nNNE-SSW block faults resemble those that are found on other\ncontinental shelves (see for example, Poag, 1982). Little has\nbeen said about the more recent (Pliocene-Pleistocene)\nenvironm, nt in the Strait, although apparently the structural\ntrends differ from those in the earlier basins and the intensity\nof tectonic movement decreases toward the west.\nThe foregoing discussion can be surmarised in two schematic\ncross-sections, one for the north acid one for south Taiwan are\ntogether with a reconstruction of might have\nshown in figs re\t\nbeen before the mountain building. The Tertiary sediments in the\nCentral Mountains and the foothills were deposited in basins on\nwi,at was at the time a passive continental margin, a 200 or so\n, the shelf in early\nkilometers wide shelf. As shown in figure\t\nTertiary probably went through the present day midpoint of the\nIsland. In other words, the northern half of the Island was on\nthe shelf, and the southern half of Taiwan was then the\ncontinental slope and part of the abyssal plain. The rocks in\nthe eastern slate belt, phyllites and slates with limy\ncomponents, may actually be mainly slope and apron sediments that\nwere subsequently tectonically emplaced onto the shelf next to\nthe shelf-deposited western belt(see further discussion later).\t\n\n4-\n\nGeologic Structures of the Island\nOff-shore Geologic Strizztures in the Taiwan Strait\nWe have mentioned the older structures in the last section. The\nmulti-channel data must contain rich information concerning the\nneotectonics in the Strait. However, the data is not available\nfor study. Lee (1973) however, has reported on the\nsingle-channel reflection profiles in the eastern half of the\nTaiwan Strait. Two nearly parallel reflection lines were run.\nIt is evident that some of the on-shore faults are extenued into\nthe strait. But it is also clear that there are two basins, the\nTaichung basin and the Hsinchu Basin that are bounded by a number\nof normal faults that cut through the youngest sediments and are\nprobably still active. The faults on the northern and southern\nedges of the Penghu platform are particularly clear. As we shall\nsee that the Strait has infrequent, but very large earthquakes,\n\nP\n\nand some of these faults are probably related to the seismicity.\nSeismicity\nThe area under consideration is seismically very active.\nKatsumata and Sykes(1969), Wu(1970,1978) among others studied\nteleseismic data compiled by USCGS, NOAA, USGS and ISC and\ninterpreted the data in terms of modern-day plate tectonics in\nthe area. Recent maps published by Tsai and others(e.g., Tsai et\nal., 1982; Lin and Tsai, 1982) use data from the Taiwan\ntelemetered network; although the main picture emerges from the\nregional network remains the same, the data provides more details\nin the immediate vicinity of Taiwan, especially in clarifying the\nrelation of the Benioff zone under the andesitic volcanoes in the\nextreme north of the island and the thickness of the seismically\nactive layer.\nThe spatial distribution of hypocenters( data from the USGS PDE\ntape and the ISS Bulletins) can be seen in a series of\n). Clearly, no Benioff\nstereoscopic perspective plots(figure\t\nzone exists in the section of Taiwan between the northern and the\nsouthern ends of the Longitudinal Valley. On the other hand, the\ndipping seismic zone continues from the Ryukyus to the region\nnortheast of the island. It is shown clearly in Lin and Tsai\n(1982) that this zone extends under the northern tip of the\nTaiwan island under the group of young andesitic volcanoes.\nthe historical seismicity of the Taiwan and the\nIn figure\t\ncontinent across the Strait is plotted. It is interesting to\nnote that several major earthquakes occurred in or off-shore of\nFujian area. All along the eastern shore of China has been\npopulated throughout the recorded history, thus the lack of large\nhistorical events elsewhere is not due to a lack of recorded\nOnly magnitude six or smaller events\nhistory of those areas.\t\nhave been reported elsewhere along the coast (Geophysical\nInstitute).\nFocal Mechanism solutions and Interpretation\nA compilation of the available focal mechanism solutions is shown\nin Table 1.\nPlate Configuration in the Taiwan Area\nFigure\t\n\ndepicts the plate configuration in the vicinity of\n\nTaiwan as implied by geology, seismicity and focal mechanisms\npresented in the last sections. The main features are: (1) a\ncollision boundary exists along the coastal range, the Philippine\nSea plate exerts stress perpendicular to the boundary as well as\nslips along this boundary in a left lateral sense, (2) the\nPhilippine sea plate\nFaulting Behind the Collision Front\nWe have discussed so far several types of recent faulting west of\nthe Longitudinal Valley. These represent faulting activities\nbehind the collision boundary. The thrust faulting in the\nfoothills is easy to understand as they are consistent with the\ndirection of the tectonic stress that cause the uplifting and\neast-west deformation on the isla d. The repeated strike-slip\nfaulting (e.g. associated with the 1935 Hsinchu and the 1906 and\nthe 1946 Chiayi earthquakes) along nearly east-west trending\nfaults, and the nearly east-west trending normal faults in the\nStrait are features that demand explanation.\nRecent Faulting and Basin Formation in SE Fujian\nNo marine geology or seismic data in the western half of the\nTaiwan Strait is now available. However, there are some recent\nland data in Fujian Province across the Strait that indicates\nsome young structural .-activities are taking place that may be a\nshows the\nresult of the intense collision in Taiwan.

The Fouzhou graben is one of\nthe largest basins in Fujian; according to drilling data, the\nsubsie..ence started in MiO- to Late-Pleistocene and has now\nreached 100 meters or so, i.e. subsiding at an average rate of\n0.3-0.7 mm/yr(Zhang, 1982). The 1604 earthquake, with an\nestimated magnitude 8 occurred in the Strait near Fouzhou.\nThe Santou basin further to the southwest is also controlled\nmainly by the rorthwes\' oriented faults; the basin contains\nvertebrate fossils of Late Mid-Pleistocene, stone-age tools etc.\nIt is clear that during Quarternary, this area has undergone\nseveral episodes of rapid subsidence; the earthquake of 1918\n(4-7.5) was apparently related to a NW oriented fault (Zhang,\n1982).\nUntil marine seismic data in the Taiwan Strait becomes available,\n\n(41\n\nthe continuity of tectonic fabrics from Taiwan to Fujian cannot\nbe ascertained. However, the occurrence of large earthquakes in\nthe Strait, the presence of east-rest to northwest oriented\nfaults on both sides of the strait, and the presence of numerous\nnormal faults in the eastern half of the Strait (Lee, 1974) all\npoint to the possibility that these structures are genetically\nrelated. These faults, at high angles, with the colission\nboundary, have been observed at several places. Molnar and\nTapponier (197 ) have particularly point out the pres,-nce of\nsuch a structure behind the Himalayas in southern Tibe:.\nDiscussion\nThe recency of the orogeny that is found on Taiwan affords us a\nchance to examine some of the details of tectonic processes that\nhad taken place. With the general agreement that collision is\nresponsible for the conversion of a continental margin into an\nimpressive mountain range does not preclude disagreement\nregarding the collision boundary nor does it imply that the major\ngeological observations have been adequately understood in terms\nof plate tectonics. We shall attempt here to offer explanations\n\nfor some of them.\nThe argillite belts in the Central Mountains have been\ninterpreted as the result of marine transgression into the\n"Taiwan Geosyncline". But the juxtapositioning of two very\ndiverse sedimentary units, the eastern belt that contains limy\nand marly layers and the western belt that contains carbonaceous\nsandstones, implies that major tectonic action had brought them\ntogether.\nThe Philippine Sea was most probably an expanding basin in early\nTertiary (e.g. Lee and Hilde, 1982; ), although the exact\nlocation of the ridge and mode of spreading is not yet totally\nclear. Thus the continental shelf of southeastern Asia ar that\ntime could resemble the Atlantic margin during late Cre^aceous\nand the present-day Atlantic margin can be viewed ad a model of\nthe pre-collision depositional basin in Taiwan area (figure \t\n).\nFrom Eocene to early Pliocene, the edge of the shelf probably\nsubsided continuously and the sediments lapped farther and\nfarther onto the adjacent floor (figure ). As the island arc\napproached the shelf, the depositional basin deepened. But the\nsediments on the ocean floor were compressed and pushed toward\n). Since part of the sediments are on the\nthe shelf (figure\t\noceanic crust and we know that the continental crust has now been\n\nis\n\ni\n\nthrusted up into mountains, with the island arc next to it, the\nsediments must have been telescoped onto the continental crust.\nAnd the eastern argillite belt could actually be these shelf edge\nto abysal sediments (figure\t\n). In fact, the "Cretaceous or\nearly Eocene" corals found in the conglomerate bed intercalated\n\xe2\x80\x94i the lower part of the slate sequence in northeastern Taiwan\n(Ho, 1982) could very well be steep reef corals on the edge of\nthe shelf that were plucked off by flow loaded with sediments.\nJudging from (1) the positions of the Miocene volcanic complex in\nthe Coastal Range and the offshore Miocene andesitic islands as\nwell as the undersea ridge that connects these points, and (2)\nthe existence of a dipping seismic zone under these islands, the\ncollision of the island arc with the continental shelf started\nin the northern portion of the Longitudinal Valley and the\ncollission in the southern half of the Coastal Range has not yet\ncome into full force. Thus we expect that Lutao and Lanhsu to\nconverge onto the eastern coast of Taiwan in the future.\nBecause of the oblique orientation of the continental shelf with\nrespect to the approaching island arc, there is a distinctive\ndifference between northern and southern Taiwan. In terms of the\nmetamorphosed paleogene sedimentary rocks, in the northern part\nof the island we find shelf facies rocks, alternating sandstone\nand shale strata with carbonaceous layers, in the southern part\nwe find deeper water facies, fine grained shale with marly\nnodules. Also, the Eocene slates appear only on the western side\nof the Paleozoic/Mesozoic metamorphic rocks in the northern half,\na long strip can be found on the eastern side of the metamorphics\nin the south. In other words, projecting into the future, one\ncould expect the further convergence of the rest of the island\narc, now marked by the positions of Lutao and Larhsu, and the\nsouthern portion of Taiwan.\n\nConclusions\nTaiwan came into being because of a former island arc (the\ncurrent Coastal Range)\nUnder Luzon a similar "reversed Benioff zone" exists, but Luzon\ndoes not have intense shortening \xe2\x80\x94 because there is nothing to\ncollide with.\nThe collision forces are so intense nea: Taiwan that it is\n\ntransmitted to areas west of Taiwan. In the Taiwan Strait, there\nare normal faulting perpendicular to the axis of Taiwan due ..o\ntensile stress behind Taiwan perpendicular to the direction of\ncollision. Across the Taiwan Strait on the Fujian Province side\nthere are a number of nearly northwest oriented basins that\nevidently started to subside at the time Taiwan rose out of the\nwater to become an island.\nAt present, the island of Taiwan represents a cross-section as\nfollows:\nEast of the Longitudinal Valley \xe2\x80\x94 Island arc and melange\ncomplex.\nWest of the Valley -- trench sediments thrusted over the edge of\nthe old continental shelf (the Eocene argillites) and the\nmiogeosynclinal sediments on the former shelf.\n\nReferences\n\nr\n\nF;\nFAULTING IN SOUTHERN XINJIANG PROVINCE, CHINA\n-- a Study based on LANDSAT ime, , es ---\n\nThe original figures are color false LANDSAT images.

There is no\nevidence that the Altyn Tagh fault extends further to the\nnortheast, beyond 98 degrees or so.
