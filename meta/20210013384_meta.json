The primary goal of this agreement is to acquire and make available Spire datasets to the research community with the aim of enhancing the science objectives through the Earth Science Division (ESD), though there are noted applications to the NASA Heliophysics Division as well.  This talk will present the data access details and holdings of Spire data by the CSDA Program, including those from radio occultation and reflectometry.  It will also present selected scientific results and applications of these data from both the pilot evaluation and the sustained purchase stages to highlight their use within the ESD research portfolio.", "isLessonsLearned": true, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210013384, "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "7e71cb6ceccc50be99ab7e636788fa59", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "University Corporation for Atmospheric Research", "location": "Boulder, Colorado, United States"}}, "meetingId": "8d5d9af5a0564d918c26bac9e93e06d8", "id": "21bbcf05254a44839738732f1c879069"}], "name": "8th International Radio Occultation Working Group Meeting - IROWG-8", "location": "virtual", "id": "8d5d9af5a0564d918c26bac9e93e06d8", "startDate": "2021-04-07T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation", "name": "mccarty-irowg_csda.pptx", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210013384/downloads/mccarty-irowg_csda.pptx", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210013384/downloads/mccarty-irowg_csda.pptx.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210013384/downloads/mccarty-irowg_csda.pptx.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
