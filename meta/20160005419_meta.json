Intelligent Automation, Inc., has developed a security-enhanced autonomous network management (SEANM) approach for space networks through cross-layer negotiation and network monitoring, analysis, and adaptation. The underlying technology is bundle-based delay/disruption-tolerant networking (DTN). The SEANM scheme allows a system to adaptively reconfigure its network elements based on awareness of network conditions, policies, and mission requirements. Although SEANM is generically applicable to any radio network, for validation purposes it has been prototyped and evaluated on two specific networks: a commercial off-the-shelf hardware test-bed using Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 Wi-Fi devices and a military hardware test-bed using AN/PRC-154 Rifleman Radio platforms. Testing has demonstrated that SEANM provides autonomous network management resulting in reliable communications in delay/disruptive-prone environments.", "title": "Security-Enhanced Autonomous Network Management", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2016-04-27T10:00:49.0630000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20160005419, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Zeng, Hui"}, "organization": {"name": "Intelligent Automation, Inc.", "location": "Rockville, MD, United States"}}, "id": "0d08e55d6fbe49c0a7409763f8eba745"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20160005419, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160005419, "id": "48921b721c8e489ba1ca124904375792", "publicationName": "An Overview of SBIR Phase 2 Communications Technology and Development", "publicationDate": "2015-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20160001356, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "An Overview of SBIR Phase 2 Communications Technology and Development", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160005419.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160005419/downloads/20160005419.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160005419/downloads/20160005419.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160005419/downloads/20160005419.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
