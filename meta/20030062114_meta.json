Many long-range goals for the nation were discussed and selected, among them were space related goals of interest to NASA. During much of the Agency's history, NASA advanced studies have focused consistently on the challenges of science-driven space exploration and operations. However, workshop findings indicate little interest in these goals unless they can also solve national and global issues. Many technologies and space development studies indicate great potential to enable new, important commercial markets in space that could address the many global challenges facing America in this century. But communication of these ideas are lacking. In conclusion, it appears that the commercial development of space could have broad implications on many impending problems, including energy resources, environmental impact, and climate changes. The challenge will be to develop a consistent coordinated effort among the many industries and Agencies that should be involved in opening this new frontier for these new commercial markets.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030062114, "endDate": "2002-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "5fb74ee36a0849749cde6f924edee134", "id": "faa23f8377ff45ec8587eaa735fb7e08"}], "name": "The World Space Congress", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "5fb74ee36a0849749cde6f924edee134", "startDate": "2002-10-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}, {"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030062114, "endDate": "2002-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "c7dab81f304e4323a483e11b4e07e39d", "id": "9e72ffac1205437aa0a5d35ad4575cce"}], "name": "53rd International Astronautical Congress", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "c7dab81f304e4323a483e11b4e07e39d", "startDate": "2002-10-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030062114, "id": "6b2300f19fda440d86d4570c54d0ec41", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030062114.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030062114/downloads/20030062114.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030062114/downloads/20030062114.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030062114/downloads/20030062114.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
