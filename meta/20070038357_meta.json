We refer to virtual characters as the name for a type of interactive object that have become familiar in computer games and within virtual reality applications. We refer to these as avatars: three-dimensional graphical objects that are in more-or-less human form which can interact with humans. Sometimes such avatars will be representations of real-humans who are interacting together within a shared networked virtual environment, other times the representations will be of entirely computer generated characters. Unlike other authors, who reserve the term agent for entirely computer generated characters and avatars for virtual embodiments of real people; the same term here is used for both. This is because avatars and agents are on a continuum. The question is where does their behaviour originate? At the extremes the behaviour is either completely computer generated or comes only from tracking of a real person. However, not every aspect of a real person can be tracked every eyebrow move, every blink, every breath rather real tracking data would be supplemented by inferred behaviours which are programmed based on the available information as to what the real human is doing and her/his underlying emotional and psychological state. Hence there is always some programmed behaviour it is only a matter of how much. In any case the same underlying problem remains how can the human character be portrayed in such a manner that its actions are believable and have an impact on the real people with whom it interacts? This paper has three main parts. In the first part we will review some evidence that suggests that humans react with appropriate affect in their interactions with virtual human characters, or with other humans who are represented as avatars. This is so in spite of the fact that the representational fidelity is relatively low. Our evidence will be from the realm of psychotherapy, where virtual social situations are created that do test whether people react appropriately within these situations. We will also consider some experiments on face-to-face virtual communications between people in the same shared virtual environments. The second part will try to give some clues about why this might happen, taking into account modern theories of perception from neuroscience. The third part will include some speculations about the future developments of the relationship between people and virtual people. We will suggest that a more likely scenario than the world becoming populated by physically embodied virtual people (robots, androids) is that in the relatively near future we will interact more and more in our everyday lives with virtual people- bank managers, shop assistants, instructors, and so on. What is happening in the movies with computer graphic generated individuals and entire crowds may move into the space of everyday life.", "title": "Interactions with Virtual People: Do Avatars Dream of Digital Sheep?", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T00:26:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20070038357, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Slater, Mel"}, "organization": {"name": "University Coll.", "location": "London, United Kingdom"}}, "id": "d2ec5c5ffa1546dc882a8d7ef79a68d5"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20070038357, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sanchez-Vives, Maria V."}, "organization": {"name": "Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Alicante", "location": "Alicante, Spain"}}, "id": "36505b5ad19b4e7eb6cd308c14456447"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070038357, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070038357, "id": "d48ac4d6487b403f909c9c96685f628c", "publicationName": "Intelligent Motion and Interaction Within Virtual Environments", "publicationDate": "2007-06-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20070038349, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Intelligent Motion and Interaction Within Virtual Environments", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070038357.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070038357/downloads/20070038357.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070038357/downloads/20070038357.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070038357/downloads/20070038357.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
