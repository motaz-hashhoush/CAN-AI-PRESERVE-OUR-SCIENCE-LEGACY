NASA's historically develops technology and capability in areas that are not commercially profitable but can enable future commercial opportunities. By leveraging the experiences and lessons learned from the past, we can improve our opportunities for success in the future. We have made great strides in these areas, but there is significant room for improvement. This paper intends to highlight many of the thoughts and considerations, which are necessary when developing a public/private partnership for \"Human Spaceflight\". Although this paper is being developed with an emphasis on \"Human Spaceflight\", many of the thoughts may have applicability to un-crewed missions. This paper does not attempt to define specific lines between government and private entities, since those lines vary based on many factors such as allocation of roles, responsibilities and accountabilities between participants and risk tolerance for both safety of flight and mission success.", "title": "Balancing Public & Private Partnerships for Future Human Spaceflight", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2019-05-09T09:53:23.7370000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20190014047, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kennedy, John J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "df6d0dcd4ba245bfa6ad5672358110b1"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "PROFESSIONAL_REVIEW", "id": 20190014047, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190014047, "id": "41e5f4e579a44d07abaaadf6f9f4c24d", "publicationDate": "2018-12-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190014047.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190014047/downloads/20190014047.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190014047/downloads/20190014047.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190014047/downloads/20190014047.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
