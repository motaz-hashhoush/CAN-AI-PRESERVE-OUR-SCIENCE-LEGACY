Testing was conducted in the Canadian High Arctic, where hilly terrain provided the worst-case testing. SFU and Canadian governmental agencies made significant technical contributions. The only technical data related to radio testing was exchanged with SFU. Test protocols are standard radio tests performed by communication technicians worldwide. The Joint Fields Operations objectives included the following: (1) to provide Internet communications services for field science work and mobile exploration systems; (2) to evaluate the range and throughput of three different medium-range radio link technologies for providing coverage of the crater area; and (3) to demonstrate collaborative software such as NetMeeting with multi-point video for exchange of scientific information between remote node and base-base camp and science centers as part of communications testing.", "title": "Intelligent Mobile Technologies", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20010085338, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Alena, Rick"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "a0ec7e6193454f1b9e409fc0b6c9a514"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20010085338, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gilbaugh, Bruce"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "703ddc5166f144a5af234414f8c97bb5"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20010085338, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Glass, Brian"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "94e7b1583b174d14b1b1e230975c1edb"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 20010085338, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Swanson, Keith"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "511bfe9000e347e4b8f8470838bb0c45"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20010085338, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010085338, "id": "ce03ed4c28174dccb22c520cfa9d42dd", "publicationDate": "2000-01-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20010085338.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20010085338/downloads/20010085338.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20010085338/downloads/20010085338.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20010085338/downloads/20010085338.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
