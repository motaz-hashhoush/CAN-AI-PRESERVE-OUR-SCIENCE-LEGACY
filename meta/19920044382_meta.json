The history of space exploration is briefly reviewed with references to the Mariner II, Apollo, and Discoverer programs. Attention is given to the issues related to return trips to the moon, sprint vs repetitive missions to Mars, and the implications of propulsion needs. The concept of terraforming other bodies within the solar system so that they can support human activity is identified as the next major phase of exploration. The following phase is considered to be the use of robotic or manned missions that extend beyond the solar system. Reference is given to a proposed Thousand Astronomical Units mission as a precursor to exploratory expansion into the universe, and current robotic mission activities are mentioned.", "title": "Universe exploration vision", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T14:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920044382, "meta": {"author": {"name": "O'Handley, D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "a46f3b02efc7453fa248416fa6343763"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920044382, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Swan, P."}, "organization": {"name": "Motorola, Inc.", "location": "McLean, VA, United States"}}, "id": "424e7e5e0c93426bab8020e09bbd9906"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920044382, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sadeh, W."}, "organization": {"name": "Colorado State University", "location": "Fort Collins, United States"}}, "id": "053e979b6a82447293fe010df2aaa3da"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920044382, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920044382, "id": "90daf3d16f19496299fcdcebe5a324b5", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
