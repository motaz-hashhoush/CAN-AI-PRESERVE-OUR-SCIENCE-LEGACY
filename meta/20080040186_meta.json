The strategic analysis methodology integrates the assessment of the major contributors to strategic objective satisfaction performance, affordability, and risk and captures the linkages and feedbacks between all three components. Strategic analysis supports strategic decision making by senior management through comparable analysis of alternative strategies, provision of a consistent set of high level value metrics, and the enabling of cost-benefit analysis. The tools developed to implement the strategic analysis methodology are not element design and sizing tools. Rather, these models evaluate strategic performance using predefined elements, imported into a library from expert-driven design/sizing tools or expert analysis. Specific components of the strategic analysis tool set include scenario definition, requirements generation, mission manifesting, scenario lifecycle costing, crew time analysis, objective satisfaction benefit, risk analysis, and probabilistic evaluation. Results from all components of strategic analysis are evaluated a set of pre-defined figures of merit (FOMs). These FOMs capture the high-level strategic characteristics of all scenarios and facilitate direct comparison of options. The strategic analysis methodology that is described in this paper has previously been applied to the Space Shuttle and International Space Station Programs and is now being used to support the development of the baseline Constellation Program lunar architecture. This paper will present an overview of the strategic analysis methodology and will present sample results from the application of the strategic analysis methodology to the Constellation Program lunar architecture.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20080040186, "endDate": "2008-09-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "03f1f22132a443abb0703b7a2d461209", "id": "326808c7d7bb4014b35f4881fb2759f6"}], "name": "AIAA Space 2008 Conference and Exposition", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "03f1f22132a443abb0703b7a2d461209", "startDate": "2008-09-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080040186, "id": "2ba3a01a1e6549d7bb8228b9c9f52170", "publicationDate": "2008-09-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080040186.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080040186/downloads/20080040186.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080040186/downloads/20080040186.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080040186/downloads/20080040186.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
