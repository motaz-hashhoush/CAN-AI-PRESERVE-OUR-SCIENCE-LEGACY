In addition, several candidate transportation node configurations are presented to accommodate the assembly and verification of the Mars Mission vehicles. This study includes an identification of a life science research program that would need to be completed, on-orbit, prior to mission departure and an assessment of the necessary orbital technology development and demonstration program needed to accomplish the mission. Also included is an analysis of the configuration mass properties and a preliminary analysis of the Space Station control system sizing that would be required to control the station. Results of the study indicate the Phase 2 Space Station can support a manned mission to Mars with the addition of a supporting infrastructure that includes a propellant depot, assembly hangar, and a heavy lift launch vehicle to support the large launch requirements.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880014327, "id": "5e1362315394429f89fac914b6e88a3c", "publicationDate": "1988-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880014327.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880014327/downloads/19880014327.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880014327/downloads/19880014327.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880014327/downloads/19880014327.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
