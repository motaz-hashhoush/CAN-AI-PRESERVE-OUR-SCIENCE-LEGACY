The possibilities of travelling several ways, including a great circle route, a more or less straightline route and following wind circulation patterns was investigated. It is found that the longest route actually uses the least fuel, some 14% less than the great circle route. It is suggested that improving the observation system has an enormous potential and probably could easily pay for itself in a year. The profiler instrumentation is developed. Some broad characteristics of the instrumentation and of the program are shown. The instrumentation can function in clear air as well as cloudy air.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 19830025565, "endDate": "1982-10-28T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "313b4dfc00e65d3cafca0b044568743b", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Federal Aviation Administration", "location": "Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "894a3498c9db42d49976d1ad6bc7f7b7", "id": "c1ef86ba359c45a589dfba995fcc71d3"}, {"organizationId": "d566efa72e145ef4a1520a6b239e414c", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration", "location": "Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "894a3498c9db42d49976d1ad6bc7f7b7", "id": "419d074c97f84e7c86e5ec29417279a9"}, {"organizationId": "ff293352e05b51ca965411fc94f5e325", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, United States"}}, "meetingId": "894a3498c9db42d49976d1ad6bc7f7b7", "id": "3ba4f94693b24da6bf6c48592e7b9724"}], "name": "6th Annual Workshop on Meteorological and Environmental Inputs to Aviation Systems", "location": "Tullahoma, TN", "id": "894a3498c9db42d49976d1ad6bc7f7b7", "startDate": "1982-10-26T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"volume": "NASA-CP-2274", "submissionId": 19830025565, "publisher": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "id": "22bb4072e39b432b88bed7b687c99369", "publicationName": "Proceedings:  Sixth Annual Workshop on Meteorological and Environmental Inputs to Aviation Systems", "publicationDate": "1982-10-26T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "issuePublicationDate": "1983-04-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00", "url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19830025556"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19830025556, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Proceedings:  Sixth Annual Workshop on Meteorological and Environmental Inputs to Aviation Systems", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PUBLICATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19830025565.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19830025565/downloads/19830025565.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19830025565/downloads/19830025565.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19830025565/downloads/19830025565.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
