Using conventional absorption spectroscopy, detection limits were quoted of 1,000,000 OH molecules per cu cm using a 30-minute averaging time on the ground, and a 3-hour averaging time in the air for present apparatus in use. With the addition of FM spectroscopy at 1 GHz, a double-beam machine should permit detectable absorption of and an OH limit of 100,000 per cu cm in a 30-minute averaging time. In the low pressure system on which experiments are ongoing nonexponential time behavior was observed after the decay had progressed to about 0.3 of its original level; this was attributed to ion emission in the photomultiplier. A flame source with OH present at high concentration levels was used as a calibration. It was estimated that within the sampling chamber, 400,000 OH could be measured. With a factor-of-2 loss at the sampling orifice, this means detectability of 5 to 8 x 100,000 cu cm at the present time. This could be reduced by a factor of 2 in one hour averaging time; improvements in laser bandwidth and energy should provide another factor of 2 in sensitivity.", "title": "OH detection by Ford Motor Company", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T08:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870006101, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wang, Charles C."}, "organization": {"name": "Ford Motor Co.", "location": "Dearborn, MI, United States"}}, "id": "3321d0c4a6bb415dbe81bd3e48bdddea"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870006101, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870006101, "id": "63a40f1be378423996f4931f250f55e7", "publicationName": "NASA.
