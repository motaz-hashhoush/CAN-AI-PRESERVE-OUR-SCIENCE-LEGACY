Historical observations have revealed many features of cyclic variations of the solar activity; but these data are dramatically insufficient to draw a physical picture of global magnetic field evolution. New observational data, currently available from space missions and ground-based observatories, provide us with detailed information about solar dynamics and magnetism. However, because of the relatively short duration of data series and the great variety of data types and quality, it is challenging to assimilate these data in theoretical models and make reliable forecasts. The recent unexpectedly weak solar activity cycles, as well as observations of rotational and magnetic topology transitions in solar-type stars, suggest that the Sun and its magnetic dynamo are currently in a very interesting evolutionary stage. This could relate to the difficulty in getting a model of the Sun to produce solar-like \u2013 rather than anti-solar-like \u2013 differential rotation, to reproduce the rotation profile obtained from helioseismology, and to predict solar activity cycles.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Canada", "submissionId": 20190025405, "endDate": "2017-07-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Science Foundation", "location": "Alexandria, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "9f1a032327bf46beb7a1e26ebafc381f", "id": "e87aed01ca174e96a84327bb3d8bf583"}], "name": "SHINE Conference 2017", "location": "Saint-Sauveur", "id": "9f1a032327bf46beb7a1e26ebafc381f", "startDate": "2017-07-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190025405, "id": "aeeac12959b64bfda79c19a6eb3b788f", "publicationDate": "2017-07-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190025405.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190025405/downloads/20190025405.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190025405/downloads/20190025405.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190025405/downloads/20190025405.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
