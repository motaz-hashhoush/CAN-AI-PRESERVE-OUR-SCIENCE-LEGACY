The cause and a cure of this divergence are discussed here. The divergence is demonstrated to occur for arbitrary perfectly conducting scatterers and its universal characterstics are determined, by means of a general divergence criterion that is derived. A variational cure for the divergence is prescribed, and it is tested successfully on a standard scattering model.", "title": "Variational divergence in wave scattering theory with Kirchhoffean trial functions", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T04:41:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870040886, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bird, J.
