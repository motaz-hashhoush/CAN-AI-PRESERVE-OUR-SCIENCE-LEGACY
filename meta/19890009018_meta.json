The concept of a Space Station is not a new one, but a redefined one. Many investigations on the kinds of experiments and work assignments the Space Station will need to accommodate have been completed, but NASA specialists are constantly talking with potential users of the Station to learn more about the work they, the users, want to do in space. Present configurations are examined along with possible new ones.", "title": "The space station", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T23:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890009018, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Munoz, Abraham"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "6c4d539f9bb94912aba7062a874780a0"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890009018, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890009018, "id": "54fb1ffd0e3d47f89c76bb94711b748e", "publicationName": "NASA Ames Summer High School Apprenticeship Research Program: 1986 Research Papers", "publicationDate": "1988-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890009018.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890009018/downloads/19890009018.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890009018/downloads/19890009018.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890009018/downloads/19890009018.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
