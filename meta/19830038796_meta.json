Physical interpretations that have been proposed to explain this event are evaluated. The energy loss spectrum accumulated during the event and compared with background spectra accumulated before and after is included. The model for the transient proposed by Lingenfelter et al. (1978), which requires an episodic accretion of gas onto a neutron star from its companion star in a two-star system, is discussed. In surveying the field of gamma-ray 'line' astronomy, it is noted that to date all of the confirmed line features have been shown to be varying with a wide variety of time scales ranging from seconds to hours and, possibly, to months.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19830038796, "endDate": "1981-08-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "U.
