b"NASA Gulf of Mexico Initiative Hypoxia Research\nThe Applied Science & Technology Project Office at Stennis Space Center (SSC) manages NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Gulf of Mexico Initiative (GOMI). Addressing shortterm crises and long-term issues, GOMI participants seek to understand the environment using remote sensing, in-situ observations, laboratory\nanalyses, field observations and computational models. New capabilities are transferred to end-users to help them make informed decisions. Some\nGOMI activities of interest to the hypoxia research community are highlighted below.\n\nProject Title: Monitoring the Mississippi River Plume from the Opening of the Bonnet\nCarr\xc3\xa9 Spillway\n\nProject Title: Enhancing NASA's COAST Online Application\nfor Agricultural Best Management Practices\nDecision Support\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Bill Graham, NASA Stennis Space Center\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Katherine Milla, Florida A&M University\n\nThe lower Suwannee River basin in central Florida has been\nsubjected to increased use of pesticides and fertilizers, runoff\nfrom dairy and poultry farms, and contaminants from pulp\nmills and phosphate mines. The Florida Department of\nAgriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) Office of\nAgricultural Water Policy implements agricultural best\nmanagement practices (BMPs) which can reduce inputs of\nagricultural nutrients to surface waters that empty into the Gulf\nof Mexico. Because adoption of BMPs is voluntary, it is crucial\nthat FDACS personnel have tools that can effectively\ncommunicate the benefits of nutrient management and can\nassist in selecting the BMPs for specific sites. This project\nintegrated NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Coastal On-line Assessment and Synthesis\nTool (COAST) and a sophisticated\nhydrological model\nprovided by Soil Water Engineering Technology, Inc. The\nresulting 3D virtual globe presents information in a way\nfamiliar to land owners, enables FDACS personnel to capture\nsite data and initiate simulations that identify BMPs for that\nsite. The results of this proposal can be adapted for different\ngeographic regions that contribute nutrient inputs to the Gulf\nof Mexico to help reduce the overall nutrient inputs to the Gulf.\n\nIn the spring of 2011, there was tremendous flooding along the Mississippi River. To\nsave Baton Rouge and New Orleans, the US Army Corps of Engineers opened the\nMorganza and Bonnet Carr\xc3\xa9 spillways in May 2011, allowing floodwaters to flow into\nLake Pontchartrain and the Atchafalaya River basin. Supporting the United States\nGeological Survey National Wetland Research Center flood response, NASA scientists\nat Stennis Space Center used data from the MODIS, ASTER, ALI and Landsat\ninstruments flying on four satellites to generate flood maps. The maps were used to\nstudy the extent of the flooding and to monitor the influx of nutrient-rich fresh water into\nthe coastal lakes, the Mississippi Sound and the Louisiana shelf.\nIn this image, sediment in the floodwater is yellow. Daily updates from some sensors\nenabled NASA and USGS scientists to monitor flooding on a regional scale and quickly\ndetect local features such as the flow of fresh water from Lake Pontchartrain into Lake\nBorgne.\n\nProject Title: Enhancing Estuarine Water Quality Management Through\nIntegrating Earth Science Research Results: A Targeted\nProject for Tampa Bay, Florida.\n\nProject Title: DEMAND - DSS Environment for Modeling of\nAtmospheric Nutrient Deposition\n\nPrime Investigator: Chuanmin Hu, University of South Florida\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Udaysankar Nair, University of Alabama,\nHuntsville\n\nAtmospheric nutrient deposition plays a role in the formation of\nhypoxic zones in the Gulf of Mexico. MODIS data coupled with\noutput from the chemical/aerosol transport model (CMAQ/AERORAMS) are used to estimate wet and dry deposition of nutrients (N,\nS, Fe and P) over land, inland water bodies, estuaries and the Gulf\nof Mexico region. Output from the model is used to partition\nobserved aerosol column loading into different categories and\ndeposition potentials are computed. DEMAND supports decision\nmaking processes related to water quality and nutrient inputs into\naquatic ecosystems in coastal and inlands areas in the state of\nAlabama. Results are hosted on the Virtual Alabama (VA) system.\nVA is a Google Earth based system developed by the Alabama\nDepartment of Homeland Security with the express purpose of\nsharing of information between different government agencies\nwithin the state of Alabama. End users include the Alabama\nDepartment of Environmental Management and the Mobile Bay\nNational Estuary Program.\n\nPresently, monitoring of estuarine water quality in the Gulf of Mexico is largely\nbased on in-situ surveys. These costly and labor intensive efforts may be\ninadequate to fully characterize short-term status and long-term trends, and\nthus could lead to biased statistics and decisions. Tampa Bay estuary has been\nmonitored for several decades using boat surveys, which provided a unique\ndataset to test our remote sensing approaches to water quality monitoring and\nmanagement. The first objective was to improve an existing water quality\ndecision matrix (WQDM) through use of the latest high spatiotemporal satellite\n(MODIS and others) observations of Tampa Bay, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s largest open-water\nestuary. The second objective was to expand such remote sensing capacity to\nother estuaries and to work with the Gulf of Mexico Alliance\xe2\x80\x99s Water Quality and\nNutrient Reduction Priority Information Teams, as well as other research\ngroups, to establish a concerted and consistent plan for Gulf of Mexico\nestuaries. The series of images to the right show annual mean chlorophyll-a\nconcentrations derived from MODIS. The decreasing trend from 2003-2004 to\n2006-2008 is primarily driven by climate variability (precipitation).\n\nProject Title: On the recurrent Ulva prolifera blooms in the Yellow\nSea and East China Sea\n\nProject Title: Improved Hypoxia Modeling for Nutrient Control\nDecisions in the Gulf of Mexico\n\nPrime Investigator: Chuanmin Hu, University of South Florida\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Shahid Habib, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\nThe Gulf of Mexico Modeling Framework is a suite of coupled models\nlinking the deposition and transport of sediment and nutrients to\nsubsequent bio-geo chemical processes and the resulting effect on\nconcentrations of dissolved oxygen in coastal waters of Louisiana and\nTexas. This project utilizes NASA data products from multiple sensors to\nattempt to improve the estimation of wet and dry deposition of nitrogen.\n\nCapabilities developed by GOMI researchers in the Gulf of Mexico are\nalso applicable in other parts of the world.\nApproximate location and distribution of U. prolifera identified from\nMODIS imagery between April 2000 and May 2009. The background\nMODIS RGB image on 5 April 2003 shows the extensive sediment\nplume from the Subei Shallow Bank to the East China Sea (ECS).\nNearly all U. prolifera algae slicks in the ECS were found in the\ndownstream portion of this plume, which occurs every year between fall\nand spring following cross\xe2\x80\x90shelf currents between the Subei Bank and\nthe ECS [Yuan et al., 2008].
