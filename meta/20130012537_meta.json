Little has been done by the launch vehicle/spacecraft manufacturers to abandon MIL-STD-461C which was released in 1986 because most of the electronics equipment being used aboard current launch vehicles is approved by similarity and heritage to MIL-STD-46 1 C and its predecessors. Twenty years later these electronic equipment items are still not tested to today's MIL-STD-461E requirements because there is a risk that the items will fail to meet the requirements and thus the cost will increase if it becomes necessary to redesign the equipment. That cost is insignificant compared with the cost of losing an entire mission! In the 20 years that have elapsed since MIL-STD-461C was released, the EMC environment has undergone major changes. High speed digital devices have been created that have fundamental clock and bus frequencies that span the entire LV/SC frequency range from the Flight Termination Systems through C and S-Band telemetry. Personnel involved in ground operations routinely carry and use hand held transceivers and cellular telephones close by sensitive electronics equipment. There are now many more orbiting receivers and emitters, plus range assets have increased dramatically since 2001. It's way past time to bring requirements up-to-date!", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130012537, "endDate": "2006-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "ba0551d9df81434cba01f0afa78bfbdf", "id": "fc694d16151248a5abcce1a5bc4f79ba"}], "name": "2006 IEEE EMC Symposium", "location": "Portland, OR", "id": "ba0551d9df81434cba01f0afa78bfbdf", "startDate": "2006-08-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130012537, "id": "3f3dd41078c745ada7cca2028afec949", "publicationDate": "2006-08-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130012537.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130012537/downloads/20130012537.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130012537/downloads/20130012537.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130012537/downloads/20130012537.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
