Figure 1\ndepicts schematically the electrical interface. The instruments\nshall provide independent, totally redundant electrical\ninterfaces except in the cases of the Main Power Line (See\n3.1.1.1.1), the Pulsed Load Power Line (see 3.1.1.1.2), the\nsurvival heater power line and the survival temperature telemetry\nsensors. The requirement for and implementation of circuit or\nfunctional redundancy internal to the instruments is dependant on\nthe instrument unique scheme for achieving specified reliability\nand life. Detailed interface requirements are described herein.\n3.1.1 Power\nThe spacecraft shall supply instruments +28 Volt Direct Current\npower on three switched circuits. Two of the circuits shall\nprovide regulated, conditioned power. These are the Main Power\nCircuit and the Pulse Load Power Circuit. The third circuit, the\nSurvival Heater Power Circuit, shall provide unregulated nominal\n+28 Volt DC power for use by the ingtrument survival heaters.\nThe spacecraft shall provide overcurrent sensing and protection\non these power circuits. The instrument shall not provide fuzes\non any power circuit. The instrument shall not be damaged by the\nsimultaneous or by any sequential application or removal of power\nfrom the power circuits. The instrument shall operate within its\nspecified performance limits when powered as specified herein.\nInstrument time-domain power consumption profiles addressing peak\nand average power in all modes shall be determined for each power\ncircuit, and the values shall be documented in the instrument\nunique interface control document. Spacecraft power circuit\ncharacteristics and instrument load characteristics shall comply\nwith the limits specified herein.\n3.1.1.1 Regulated Power Characteristics\nThe Spacecraft shall supply to the instruments regulated nominal\n+28 Volt Direct Current power on the Main Power circuit and the\nPulsed Load Power circuit.\nMain and pulsed load power are applied to the instrument at turnon and when the instrument is in an operational mode. Main and\npulsed load power are not supplied during launch or orbital\ninsertion operations.\nThe main power circuit provides we-11 regulated power with minimum\nload-induced transients and ripple and is intended to be the\nprinciple source of steady state power for the instrument. This\nsupply has limited tolerance for instrument load dynamics as\nspecified in paragraph 3.1.1.3.1 below.\n3\n\nGSFC-S-480-53, Rev B\n10 August 1993\nThe pulse load power circuit supplies well regulated power with\ngreater tolerance for load-induced ripple and transients. It is\nintended to power instrument loads such as stepper motors,\noperational heaters, and other circuits whic.:h by their nature\ncannot meet the *fipple and transient limits that are imposed on\nloads which are powered by the main power circuit.\nMain and pulsed load power, once applied, may normally be removed\nfrom the instrument at any time after the instrument has been\nconfigured to a SAFE condition. The instrument shall, however,\nnot be damaged by the removal of both or either the main or\npulsed load power while the instrument is in any operating state.\nThe spacecraft provides redundant main and pulsed load power\nsources. Instruments having redundant circuits powered by the\nmain power circuits shall prOride redundant main power\nconnections. Instruments that do not have redundant circuits\npowered by the main power circuits may elect to have a single\nmain power connection, in which case the spacecraft shall provide\nthe necessary redundant source switching, utilizing a single main\npower line. The instrument main power circuit terminal\nconfiguration shall be described in the instrument unique\ninterface control document.\nInstruments having redundant circuits powered by the Pulse Load\npower circuits shall provide redundant pulse load power circuit\nconnections. Instruments that do not have redundant circuits\npowered by the pulse load power circuits may elect to have a\nsingle pulse load power connection, in which case the spacecraft\nshall provide the necessary redundant source switching, utilizing\na single pulsed load power line. The instrument pulse load power\ncircuit terminal configuration shall be described in the\ninstrument unique interface control document.\nA. Normal operating Limits - The instrument shall meet all\nperformance requirements when supplied operating power within the\nnormal operating limits specified in this document. The normal\noperating limits applicable to the main and pulsed load Power\ncircuits are defined herein.\n1. Source Regulation - The voltage, exclusive of ripple and\ntransients, on the main and pulsed load power circuits shall be,\nwhen applied, +28 \xc2\xb1 0.56 Volts with respect to the circuit\'s\npower return as measured at the spacecraft po Teer source.\n2. Source Voltage Ripple - Steady state voltage ripple including\nrepetitive spikes, superimposed on the line voltage, as measured\nat the spacecraft power source under specified instrument loads,\nshall not exceed 200 -iilivolts peak to peak inclusive of all\nfrequency components below 100 kHz.\n3. Source Transient Performance (Operational). The instrument\nshall be exposed to source transients from multiple sources.\nSource transients may be additive but shall not cause the source\nvoltage to drop below +16 volts nor exceed +38 volts.\n4\n\nGSFC-S-480-53, Rev B\n10 August 1993\na. Low frequency load induced transients - Voltage\ntransients may occur, at the main power source,\nsimultaneously with the application or removal of power, or\nthe initiation of mode changes within a load. Voltage\ntransients may occur at the pulsed load power source due to\nthe operation of stepped or pulsed loads (eg. scanner\nmotors, operational heaters, etc.). The load changes may be\ninduced by the instrument, other instruments or spacecraft\nsubsystems.\nThe spacecraft shall provide main and pulsed load power\nsources which shall respond to step changes in their\nrespective load currents in accordance with the following.\nThe induced transient voltage, measured at the power source,\nas superimposed on the steady state voltage, shall comply\nwith the following limits:\ni. waveform - The induced transient voltage waveform\nshall be a damped sinusoid having a Q at the resonant\nfrequency of no greater than 3.\nii. Sensitivity - The absolute value of the peak\ninduced transient in Volts shall be no greater than\n0.133 times the value of the step current value in\nAmperes.\niii.

Except where noted the units shall meet all\nspecified performance criteria during these tests, and the units\nshall be operated and configured during these tests in a manner\nsimulating actual operating conditions expected during the\nvarious flight stages. In this appendix the letter 00 G 11 is used\nto designate an acceleration equivalent to one Earth gravity (ie\napproximately 9.81 m/sect).\n10.1.1 Low Level Sine Survey.\nA low level sine survey (= 0.25 G peak) shall be conducted on the\ninstrument to identify the primary resonant frequencies, and to\ndemonstrate that the structural resonance requirements have been\nmet. The instrument shall be in the launch configuration for\nthis test.\n10.1.2 Static Loads Test (Acceleration).\nA static load test shall be performgd where applicable load\nspecified in Figure 10.1 is applied along the direction of the\nvelocity, anti-sun and nadir axes. The test item shall be in the\nlaunch configuration and shall be mounted in the shaker as it\nwould be in the spacecraft. The test method may be either static\nload, acceleration or sine burst. The sine burst is recommended\nas the most practicable. The frequency used to perform the sine\nburst test is a function of both the dynamic characteristics of\nthe test item and the limitation of the shaker facility. Because\nthe test is intended to impart a static load to the test item,\nthe test frequency should be less than one-third the test item\nresonant frequency to avoid dynamic amplification during the\ntest. Should it not be possible to perform the test using sine\nburst one of the other alternatives shall be used.\nFigure 10.2 shows a typical sine burst waveform envelope. The\nwaveform is sinusoidal with a ramp up to maximum level, several\ncycles at maximum level, and then a ramp down to zero. A typical\nfrequency is 20 Hertz, and the number of cycles at the maximum\nlevel is usually 6 to 10. The specification of a sine burst test\nshall contain the following information:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Test Level ( as determined from Figure 10.1 )\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Test Frequency ( less than one-third the fundamental\nresonant frequency of the test item ).\no Test Duration ( 6 to 10 cycles at maximum level\n10.1.3 Vibration Test.\n\n90-2\n\nGSFC-S-480-53, Rev B\n10 August 1993\n10.1.3.1 Random Vibration.\nThe Instrument shall be subjected to the following qualification\nlevel vibration test in each of three orthogonal reference axes.\nDuring these tests each instrument shall be in the planned launch\nconfiguration.
