The Japanese National Railways has developed the light weight 4 K on-board refrigerators since 1977 as part of the MAGLEV train program. Superconducting and cryogenic fundamental technology was examined which included high performance cryocooler, magnetic refrigerator and superfluid refrigeration. Space cryogenics such as the cooling systems of IR-detectors was studied. Cryocooler for special applications such as cryopump, NMR-CT and JJ devices was investigated. Compact heat exchangers, high performance regenerators and reliable compressors are investigated as a critical component technology.", "title": "Recent cryocooler progress in Japan", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T22:06:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860001902, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Matsubara, Y."}, "organization": {"name": "Nihon Univ.", "location": "Tokyo, Japan"}}, "id": "5a1025c8465146d991854b655661ab3b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19860001902, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860001902, "id": "1277d5a3e8424073b9c0338db8a98666", "publicationName": "NBS  Proc. of the 3rd Cryocooler Conf.", "publicationDate": "1985-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19860001900, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Proceedings of the Third Cryocooler Conference", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19860001902.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19860001902/downloads/19860001902.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19860001902/downloads/19860001902.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19860001902/downloads/19860001902.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
