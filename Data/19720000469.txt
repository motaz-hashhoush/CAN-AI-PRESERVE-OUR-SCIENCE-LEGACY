Figure 1 shows a standard\nball detent release mechanism. As pressure is applied to\nthe piston in the actuator housing, the actuator shaft\nmoves to the right allowing the locking ball to fall inward\n\nin the detent of the shaft. This allows the locking ring to\nslide off the outside diameter of the actuator housing\nthereby releasing the assembly to be deployed. However,\nif one or any of the locking balls hang up in their respective\nhole for one reason or another, the assembly could not be\ndeployed.\n\n(continued overleaf)\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States \t\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States \t\n\n- Government assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nFigure 2 shows the same mechanism with two changes.\nThe locking ring is segmented (like dogs on a quick disconnect coupling), and a segmented lock ring retainer has\nbeen added. Normal operation would be as described in\nFigure 1. However, if one or any of the locking balls\nshould hang up in their respective holes, the assembly\ncould still be deployed in the following method. The\n\nmotion of the actuator shaft picks up the segmented lock\nring retainer (which is spring loaded in place) and moves\nit to the right uncovering the segmented lock ring. The\nonly restraint on the segmented lock ring now is a light\nwire at the outside diameter of the segments. This allows\nthe segments to expand outward and go over the outside\ndiameter of the locking balls.\n\nAssembly To Be\r\nDeployed\n\nRing Retainer\n\nLock Ring\t\n\nFigure 2\n\nNote:\nNo further information is available.
