The last decade has seen the rise of space tourism, and the founding of ambitious private space mining companies, showing the beginnings of a new exploration era, that is based on a more generalized and regular access to space and which is not limited to the Earth's vicinity. However, the cost of launching sufficient mass into orbit to sustain these inspiring challenges is prohibitive, and the necessary infrastructures to support these missions is still lacking. To provide easy and affordable access into orbital and deep space destinations, there is the need to create a network of spaceports via specific waypoint locations coupled with the use of natural resources, or In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), to provide a more economical solution. As part of the International Space University Space Studies Program 2012, the international and intercultural team of Operations and Service Infrastructure for Space (OASIS) proposes an interdisciplinary answer to the problem of economical space access and transportation. This paper presents a summary of a detailed report [1] of the different phases of a project for developing a network of spaceports throughout the Solar System in a timeframe of 50 years. The requirements, functions, critical technologies and mission architecture of this network of spaceports are outlined in a roadmap of the important steps and phases. The economic and financial aspects are emphasized in order to allow a sustainable development of the network in a public-private partnership via the formation of an International Spaceport Authority (ISPA). The approach includes engineering, scientific, financial, legal, policy, and societal aspects. Team OASIS intends to provide guidelines to make the development of space transportation via a spaceports logistics network feasible, and believes that this pioneering effort will revolutionize space exploration, science and commerce, ultimately contributing to permanently expand humanity into space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Italy", "submissionId": 20120015766, "endDate": "2012-10-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Astronautics Congress 2012", "location": "Naples", "id": "a82e27c7e1a440e79693603401297099", "startDate": "2012-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120015766, "id": "6f5b0ba44ec8448f95271e459c3f2501", "publicationDate": "2012-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120015766.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120015766/downloads/20120015766.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120015766/downloads/20120015766.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120015766/downloads/20120015766.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
