That FRR is now planned for May 10-11. It will be used by NASA and contractor managers to reaffirm the readiness of all program elements to support the new target to return the U.S. space program to manned launch operations. It will also enable them to better raise any final issues that could slip the target again, if necessary, to complete more work and documentation.", "title": "Time Critical", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T05:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050166896, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Covault, Craig"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Kennedy Space Center", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "16545d6b2d354f57937462798ae87c6c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050166896, "publications": [{"volume": "162", "submissionId": 20050166896, "issue": "17", "issn": "0005-2175", "id": "5327ab5b3b2f4ebb8a16f1aef5fd7c63", "publicationName": "Aviation Week and Space Technology", "publicationDate": "2005-04-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
