LiNb0 3 ACOUSTO-OPTIC FILTER.\n\nRecent investigations suggest the possibility , of a\nnarrow band optical filter that is electronically tunable over a large wavelength region. This conceptual\nitem should be of interest to the optical industry.\nBasically, the filter would utilize collinear acoustooptic diffraction in an optically anisotropic media.\nThe band of optical frequencies through which the\nfilter will pass may be changed by changing the\ndriving acoustic frequency. It is shown that a LiNb03\nacousto-optic filter with a pass band approximately\n1.3 cm wide which is tunable from 4000 A to 7000A\nshould be possible by changing the acoustic frequency\nfrom 428 MHz to 990 MHz. For this case, the angular\naperture will be about 1.50, and it should be possible\nto attain 100% (theoretical) transmission at the filter\n\ncenter frequency at an expenditure of about 14 mw of\nacoustic power per mm 2 of filter aperture.\nThe proposed acousto-optic filter consists of an\ninput polarizer, a crystal with an appropriate transducer, and an output polarizer. There exist a number\nof different crystal orientations, involving either\nlongitudinal or shear waves which allow collinear\ndiffraction of light into the orthogonal polarization.\nOne possible configuration for the filter using LiNb03\nis shown in the figure. In this case the acoustic wave\nis brought in as a longitudinal wave which is then\nconverted to a shear wave upon reflection at the input\nface of the crystal. The acoustic shear wave and the\ninput optical beam then propagate collinearly down\nthe y-axis of the crystal, along which the acousto(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

Interaction between the\nacoustic and optical waves takes place as a result\nof the photoelastic effect.\n\nNotes:\n1. Existing filters of the Lyot type are available with\nsuch narrow bandwidths and wave length tuning\ncapabilities.\n2. Probably the most severe limitation of the proposed filter is the difficulty of obtaining large\napertures. Since 14 mw pf propagating acoustic\npower is required per mm2 of crystal aperture, a\n1 cm square aperture would require an acoustic\npower of 1.4 watts. Broadband r-f to acoustic\ntransducers can now be constructed with about\n10 dB conversion loss, thus requiring an r-f\npower of 14 watts. Also, at frequencies in the 400\nto 1000 MHz range, the construction of transducers\nhaving one cm 2 of area is somewhat ahead of the\npresent state of the art.\n3. Two other materials which may be used for this\ntype of filter are sapphire and quartz. The birefringence of both of these materials is about 1/10\nthat of LiNb03. As a result the necessary acoustic\nfrequencies would be centered about 70 MHz instead of 700 MHz as in the LiNb0 3 filter. Both the\ntuning rate and also the bandwidth of these filters\n(for the same crystal length) would be about ten\n\nBrief 69-10466\t\n\ntimes as large as that of the LiNb0 3 filter. The\nangular aperture would be about three times as\nlarge as that of a LiNb0 3 filter of the same length.\nAs a result of the low refractive indices of these\ncrystals, about ten to twenty times as much acoustic\npower would probably be required to obtain the\ntheoretical 100% peak transmission. However, this\nmight be off-set by using longer crystals.\n4. This development is in a conceptual stage only;\nat the time of this publication no model or prototype exists.
