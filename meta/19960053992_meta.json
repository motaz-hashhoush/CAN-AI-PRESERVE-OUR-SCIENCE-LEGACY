Significant progress has been made in understanding the technical challenges of fully reusable launch systems and the accompanying management and operational approaches for achieving a low-cost program. This paper reviews the current status of the Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Program including the DC-XA, X-33 and X-34 flight systems and associated technology programs. It addresses the specific technologies being tested that address the technical and operability challenges of reusable launch systems including reusable cryogenic propellant tanks, composite structures, thermal protection systems, improved propulsion, and subsystem operability enhancements. The recently concluded DC-XA test program demonstrated some of these technologies in ground and flight tests. Contracts were awarded recently for both the X-33 and X-34 flight demonstrator systems. The Orbital Sciences Corporation X-34 flight test vehicle will demonstrate an air-launched reusable vehicle capable of flight to speeds of Mach 8. The Lockheed-Martin X-33 flight test vehicle will expand the test envelope for critical technologies to flight speeds of Mach 15. A propulsion program to test the X-33 linear aerospike rocket engine using a NASA SR-71 high speed aircraft as a test bed is also discussed. The paper also describes the management and operational approaches that address the challenge of new cost-effective, reusable launch vehicle systems.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "China", "submissionId": 19960053992, "endDate": "1996-10-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Astronautical Congress", "location": "Beijing", "id": "e50242d07db94a688b5f06ca7b880cda", "startDate": "1996-10-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960053992, "id": "b5e7c85117ad434280f94c529333d712", "publicationDate": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960053992.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960053992/downloads/19960053992.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960053992/downloads/19960053992.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960053992/downloads/19960053992.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
