A smooth transition from cruise operations through the prime science mission and extended science (Equinox) mission culminating in the currently executing Solstice mission has folded in necessary procedural alterations due to improved understanding of the spacecraft, instruments, uplink and planning systems as well as additional science objectives. These have come with the maturation of the mission along with management of workforce reductions. One important set of operational changes has been initiated due to scientific findings highlighting \"missed\" science opportunities. This is the case for the Titan Meteorology Campaigns and Saturn Storm Watch Campaigns. These observations involve long term monitoring of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn while the spacecraft and science teams are focused on other high priority targets of opportunity (like Enceladus). Our objective in this paper is to emphasize how a non-invasive strategy to get additional remarkable science was conceived and implemented in a mission with an already well defined operational plan. To illustrate this we will detail Titan Meteorology Campaign and Saturn Storm Watch Campaign integration and implementation strategies as well as the scientific goals and achievements of both.", "title": "Adding \"Missed\" Science to Cassini's Ops Plan", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2016-07-01T08:07:05.5830000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20160008212, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Roy, Mou"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "d953dcd175f2465dba4d1ad9b7331de7"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20160008212, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Burton, Marcia E."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "35c41380666647a7b456d8871e22273e"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20160008212, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Edgington, Scott"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "2b6e70f7ee5f4348a4501411e1065d96"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 20160008212, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pitesky, Jo E."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "d68dee6fea59488682e2ad5a0068986e"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 20160008212, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Steadman, Kimberly B."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "a51416d28b794580a39a0ceab7eb1c0d"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 20160008212, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ray, Trina L."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "a45549ffea0f48d7936d44147f90662b"}, {"sequence": 6, "submissionId": 20160008212, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Evans, Mike"}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell Univ.", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "e0776a2b9f8f416faf8e4537b5fbd139"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160008212, "endDate": "2014-05-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "44f7820884354e1cb93f14043896d696", "id": "23ccd6dfc7b0490789ca7a9b848226e8"}], "name": "International Conference on Space Operations", "location": "Pasadena, CA", "id": "44f7820884354e1cb93f14043896d696", "startDate": "2014-05-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 20160008212, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "hdl:2014/45568", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160008212, "id": "53cdcfd190794737a84772761040b8ad", "publicationDate": "2014-05-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
