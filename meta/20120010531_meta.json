Recent technological advances provide the foundation for a significant evolution of instrumentation; however, the funding support is currently too small to fully utilize these advances. We propose that an increase in funding for instrumentation development occur in the near-term so that these foundational technologies can be applied. These instruments would directly address the significant knowledge gaps for humans to Mars orbit, humans to the Martian surface, and humans to Phobos/ Deimos. They would also address the topics covered by the Decadal Survey and the Mars scientific goals, objectives, investigations and priorities as stated by the MEPAG. We argue that an increase of science instrumentation funding would be of great benefit to the Mars program as well as the potential for human exploration of the Mars system. If the total non-Earth-related planetary science instrumentation budget were increased 100% it would not add an appreciable amount to the overall NASA budget and would provide the real potential for future breakthroughs. If such an approach were implemented in the near-term, NASA would benefit greatly in terms of science knowledge of the Mars, Phobos/Deimos system, exploration risk mitigation, technology development, and public interest.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120010531, "endDate": "2012-06-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "meetingId": "636220a90bd84ed689cd87ea01c6affd", "id": "2f849361ea3f41498f2a927a07672298"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "636220a90bd84ed689cd87ea01c6affd", "id": "bf87148526e145d1b1df18ea7f2091b4"}], "name": "Concept and Approaches for Mars Exploration Workshop", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "636220a90bd84ed689cd87ea01c6affd", "startDate": "2012-06-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120010531, "id": "c674dd0a20b1439c9d57ee8c9a4f459f", "publicationDate": "2012-06-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120010531.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120010531/downloads/20120010531.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120010531/downloads/20120010531.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120010531/downloads/20120010531.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
