Since\nthe Earth\'s current human population is stressing the environment and the resources off-Earth are\nrelatively unlimited, by as soon as 2040 more than one thousand people could be living in Earthorbiting artificial-gravity habitats. Eventually, the majority of humanity may live in artificialgravity habitats throughout this solar system as well as others, but little is known about the longterm (multi-generational) effects of artificial-gravity habitats on people, animals, and plants.\nIn order to extend life permanently beyond Earth, it would be useful to create an orbiting space\nfacility that generates 1g as well as other gravity levels to rigorously address the numerous\nchallenges of such an endeavor. Before doing so, developing a ground-based artificial-gravity\nfacility is a reasonable next step. Just as the International Space Station is a microgravity\nresearch facility, at a small fraction of the cost and risk a ground-based artificial-gravity facility\ncan begin to address a wide-variety of the artificial-gravity life-science questions and\nengineering challenges requiring long-term research to enable people, animals, and plants to live\noff-Earth indefinitely.\nNASA has been interested in developing such a facility since at least 1969 (Larson, 1969) and\nscientists, such as Dr. Wernher von Braun were working on the concept decades earlier. In 1952\nwhile von Braun was the Technical Director of the U.S. Army Ordnance Guided Missiles\nDevelopment Group, he publicized the conceptual design of an orbiting space station that would\nrotate to produce "synthetic" gravity. The design he envisioned in that article was a 250\' diameter\nwheel, constructed in Low-Earth orbit (LEO) out of modules, and is shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Wernher von Braun Space Station Design\n(Bonestell) in (von Braun, 1952)\n\nIn this article, von Braun describes this space station producing 1g by rotating with a rotational\nperiod of 12.3 seconds (4.9 RPM) and producing 1/3g by rotating with a rotational period of 22\nseconds (2.7 RPM) (von Braun, 1952).\n1\n\nAt the request of the NASA Administrator to make recommendations for astronaut health for\nlong-duration missions, the National Academies Institute of Medicine committee recommended\nfor NASA to focus on giving, \xe2\x80\x9cincreased priority to understanding, mitigating, and\ncommunicating to the public the health risks of long-duration missions beyond Earth orbit\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9cusing more extensively analog environments that already exist and that have yet to be\ndeveloped;\xe2\x80\x9d (Committee on Creating a Vision for Space Medicine During Travel Beyond Earth\nOrbit, Board on Health Sciences Policy, 2001). More recently, the International Academy of\nAstronautics Study Group on artificial gravity recommended that, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most efficient means of\ndeveloping an effective flight artificial gravity countermeasure is by appropriate and timely use\nof ground facilities\xe2\x80\x9d (International Academy of Astronautics, 2009). The report by The National\nAcademies National Research Council (NRC) Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board of their\nreview of the NASA Space Technology Roadmap states, \xe2\x80\x9cThe panel identified Artificial Gravity\nEvaluation/Implementation as a game-changing capability that would greatly mitigate many\nadverse health effects that would otherwise occur during long-duration habitation in transit (or\nEarth orbit).\xe2\x80\x9d (NASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities: Restoring NASA\'s\nTechnological Edge and Paving the Way for a New Era in Space, 2012, p. 195).\nThe ground-based artificial-gravity facility design concept described herein is the extensible,\nmodular, Extended-Stay HyperGravity Facility (ESHGF). The ESHGF produces an adjustable,\nhypergravity-level (gravity exceeding 1g) environment in a 150m radius rotating facility for\npeople to work and live in along with animals and plants for long-term periods. The design is\nextensible so that it can be incrementally implemented so that small-scale operations can be\nrealized within a relatively short schedule and low budget. The ESHGF capabilities and\ncapacities can be incrementally increased as demand and budgets permit.\n\n1.2\n\nBenefits\n\nThe ESHGF is expected to yield several benefits:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nValidate artificial-gravity facilities on Earth as a precursor for their development off-Earth.\nThe greater the rotation rate and shorter the centrifuge radius required for humans to be safe\nand comfortable with over long-periods, the smaller the mass and cost for an artificial-gravity\nspace facility. The report, \xe2\x80\x9cSafe Passage: Astronaut Care for Exploration Missions\xe2\x80\x9d\n(Committee on Creating a Vision for Space Medicine During Travel Beyond Earth Orbit,\nBoard on Health Sciences Policy, 2001) extensively documents many areas in which\nknowledge is insufficient regarding the health of astronauts on long-duration missions. Even\nless is known regarding the effects of various and changing gravity levels on the health of\nhumans living off-Earth indefinitely including child development.\nAn ESHGF can be used as an analogue for future artificial-gravity facilities located on-orbit,\non the surface or in tunnels in the Moon, Mars, Phobos, Deimos, and asteroids, as well as to\nresearch what life might be like under such conditions. The resulting science would be\nbeneficial in designing future spacecraft and space facilities requiring artificial gravity.\nDoing so can enable the permanent residence of humans off Earth in rotating facilities such\nthat the environment of these settlements are engineered to be Earth-like by providing\nartificial gravity.\n2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCharacterize the effects and risks of long-term and periodic exposure to various hypergravity\nlevels on humans, animals, and plants in a closed, engineered environment. With renewed\ninterest in human missions to Mars (NASA, 2015), any credible attempt will need to provide\nsome type of gravity augmentation due to the extended duration of such missions. To date,\nonly a few people have lived off-Earth for more than a year and the extended time in a\nmicrogravity environment caused significant detrimental effects, e.g., muscle loss,\ncardiovascular deconditioning, and a reduction in bone density. Little is known of the longterm (multi-year and multi-generational) effects for humans, plants, and animals living in a\ngravity environment of other than 1g. An overview of the effects of microgravity on humans\nand artificial gravity research is presented in Artificial Gravity (Cl\xc3\xa9ment & Bukley, 2007).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCharacterize the long-term effects of living in rotating environments with radii significantly\ngreater than 10m. Human centrifuges have been tested with radii <10m for short periods, but\nthe short-radius rotational effect is too uncomfortable for humans at more than a few RPM\neven for short periods, e.g., motion sickness, and the cockpits were too small for longduration tests. The "Coriolis effect" is experienced when moving within a rotating reference\nframe, such as a vehicle or centrifuge, and is associated with vestibular disturbances resulting\nin motion sickness and disorientation. The physiological effects of Coriolis accelerations\nwith respect to artificial gravity systems are of particular research interest (Matsnev, 1996).\nNegative Coriolis effects are mitigated by constraining head movement and body translation\nin a centrifuge, but it is undesirable to constrain either for humans in a long-term artificialgravity facility.\nIn addition to the Coriolis effect, the gravity gradient of a centrifuge can be a significant\nissue. A person standing in a centrifuge with a 8m diameter and subject to centripetal\nacceleration that generates 1g at the feet will only experience approximately 0.5g at the head\n(excluding Earth gravity). Since the brain contains the vestibular system used to sense gravity\nand accelerations, such a sharp gravity gradient is disorienting when the person moves,\namong other things. This gradient decreases as the centrifuge diameter increases and is\nnegligible in a centrifuge with a diameter of 300m that this design concept describes.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProvide flight crew training and physical therapy to mitigate the effects of prolonged\nexposure to microgravity environments. Living in a microgravity is known to cause a variety\nof adverse effects. By living in a hypergravity environment before and/or after prolonged\nexposure to a microgravity environment, the negative effects may be mitigated and the\nrehabilitation may be accelerated for space flight crew (Davis-Street & Paloski, 2007),\n(Yang, Baker, Graf, Larson, & Caiozzo, 2007).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProvide physical therapy to improve human and animal health and capabilities. Long-term\nliving in a hypergravity environment can increase muscle strength and bone density as well\nas strengthen organs and improve resistance to loss of consciousness under high-g\nconditions. Preliminary studies of the effects of prolonged hypergravity on rats, up to 4.7g\nfor up to 1 year, resulted in no deleterious effects and discovering significant physiological\nchanges to the rats, such as significant increases in organ and bone mass with little change in\noverall weight compared to the control rats (Oyama & Platt, 1965). Additional research is\nrequired to determine the long-term effects of hypergravity on larger mammals as well as the\n3\n\nlonger-term, multi-generational consequences of hypergravity. Once validated for prolonged\nuse by humans, this facility could be used for individuals benefiting from extraordinary\nstrength, e.g., athletes, and select military personnel. It also could be used for physical\ntherapy for patients unable to exercise, e.g., subject to extended bed rest, and for elderly\nindividuals to mitigate muscle loss and bone loss (e.g., osteoporosis). There is also evidence\nthat hypergravity may have therapeutic applications involving cellular development (Genchi,\net al., 2015).\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProvide health, recreational, and educational facilities for short-term visitors to engage the\npublic in NASA\'s effort to extend life beyond Earth. Among other things, this would allow\nthe public to interact with NASA researchers and their subjects in a stimulating environment.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nValidate the human use of a wide-variety of systems that were engineered and tested for use\non Earth at 1g, e.g., shower, toilet, blender, washing machine, refrigerator, since their\nperformance can vary significantly at different gravity levels. Enabling the development of\n1g space facilities significantly reduces or entirely eliminates the cost and risk of\nreengineering the wide variety of objects and systems needed by space settlements.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProvide a mobile facility capable of housing a scalable number of people, from none to\nthousands.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProvide a wide variety of habitats for plants and animals ranging from desert to oceanic.\n\nAdditional less tangible benefits can be expected from building a realistic space-settlement\nanalogue and permitting the general public to tour it, such as the inspiration that is derived from\nleading the way for the permanent migration of life beyond Earth that includes thousands of\npeople within the lifetimes of most of us.\n\n1.3\n\nBackground\n\nThe ESHGF is essentially the merger of two technologies: centrifuges and trains, in which an\nextremely long-arm centrifuge is created using vehicles similar to tilting trains.\n1.3.1 Centrifuges\nHuman centrifuges have been used to generate hypergravity for centuries. Erasmus Darwin\nrecounted experiments in which the human subject was placed on a rotating corn-mill stone,\nwhich was accelerated to an RPM that mechanically induce \xe2\x80\x9csleep\xe2\x80\x9d (Darwin, 1809). Centrifuges\nwere used in psychiatric wards to treat patients in the early 1800s (Harsch, 2006).\nCurrently, an 18m radius centrifuge operates at the Yuri Gagarin Research & Test Cosmonaut\nTraining Center that is capable of generating up to 8g, has three interchangeable cabins mounted\nat the end of the arm, and is used for space crew training (Gararin Cosmonaut Training Center,\n2015). As shown in Figure 2, a 29\xe2\x80\x99 radius 20g centrifuge (human-rated for 12.5g) operates at the\nNASA Ames Research Center and has exposed human subjects to hypergravity for durations up\nto 22-hours (NASA ARC, 2015). Both centrifuges have relatively small cabin sizes and the\noccupants generally are intended to remain stationary within the cabins during operation.\n\n4\n\nFigure 2: NASA Ames Research Center 20g Centrifuge (NASA ARC, 2015)\n\nOrbiting Centrifuges\nIn 1895, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a pioneer of astronautics, wrote "Dreams of Earth and Sky," in\nwhich he imagined generating artificial gravity in space by means of trains running in circles\n(Tsiolkovsky K. , 1895/1979), (Andrews, 2009). Later in "Investigation of World Spaces by\nReactive Vehicles (1911-1912)," he noted that the further a human subject is from the axis of a\ncentrifuge the better. Tsiolkovsky also experimented with centrifuges on animals and proposed\nthat a train on a tilted, circular track could be used to generate artificial gravity over extended\nperiods for research (Tsiolkovsky K. E., 1911-1912/2004, pp. 118-121). However, there is no\nrecord that such a train was ever designed or built.\nStarting in the 1950s, humans were tested in a centrifuge with a 50\xe2\x80\x99 arm, capable of generating\nclose to 50g\xe2\x80\x99s, at the Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, PA. In 1958, this facility was\nused to test X-15 pilots and later was used for astronaut testing for the NASA Mercury, Gemini,\nand Apollo space programs (Hoey, 2010, pp. 398-400). In 1959, the Army Ballistic Missile\nAgency proposed a human \xe2\x80\x9cSpace Flight Simulator\xe2\x80\x9d that consisted of a 500\xe2\x80\x99-radius\nsuperelevated circular track, a 4-person 24\xe2\x80\x99 jet-powered sled, a transition track, and a 3622\xe2\x80\x99\nvertical track that the sled would ascend and launch into a sub-orbital trajectory after reaching a\nsufficient velocity by traveling on the circular track (Gerathewohl, 1961).\nIn the 1975 NASA study, "Space Settlements: A Design Study,\xe2\x80\x9d an orbiting space settlement\ncapable of supporting a population of ten thousand is described in detail. The orbiting space\nsettlement envisioned in this study is shown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: Orbital Space Settlement (NASA, 1977)\n\nIn this design, the 1790m diameter space station wheel rotates at 1 RPM inside a non-rotating\nring shield to produce 1g at the wheel rim bottom floor (Space Settlements: A Design Study,\n\n5\n\n1977). The wheel rim modules can be viewed as train cars running on a circular track in which\nthe track is the ring shield.\nThomas W. Hall\xe2\x80\x99s doctoral dissertation, "The Architecture of Artificial-Gravity Environments\nfor Long-Duration Space Habitation," describes several design considerations with regard to\ndesigning facilities for long-term occupation that rely on spin-induced centripetal acceleration to\ngenerate artificial gravity (Hall, 1994).\nA long-duration, large-radius \xe2\x80\x9cHuman Hypergravity Habitat\xe2\x80\x9d was proposed (van Loon J. J.,\n2009), (van Loon & Wuyts, 2009), (van Loon J. J., 2012). The concept is essentially a train on a\ncircular track designed to generate a specific, long-duration hypergravity level for humans. The\nESA Large Radius Human Centrifuge Topical Team recommended a track diameter of 150m\nwith a maximum design load of 2g\'s. Initial tests for long-term hypergravity exposure should be\nin the range of 1.4 - 1.5g\'s and then incrementally increased (van Loon & Wuyts, 2009).\n1.3.2 Trains\nAn ESHGF can be implemented using readily available wheeled-train technologies. Trains have\nbeen used for over two centuries for reliable transport and are operational around the world.\nThey remain a dominant, low-cost means of transportation.\nRichard Trevithick is credited with building the first steam-powered train. It was based on a\nportable steam engine patented by Trevithick and Andrew Vivian in 1802 (Dickinson & Titley,\n1934, pp. 269-278), and ran 9 miles at nearly 5 miles per hour carrying 10 tons of iron, 5\nwagons, and 70 men in South Wales on 2/21/1804; heralding a new age of transportation\n(Dickinson & Titley, 1934, pp. 63-71) (Amgueddfa Cymru \xe2\x80\x94 National Museum Wales, 2008).\nTilting Trains\nTrains with tilting cabins to compensate for track cant as well as centripetal acceleration on\ncurves began development in the mid-1930s (Van Dorn & Beemer, 1940), (Life Magazine,\n1940). These first tilting cabins were mounted on their rail car chassis with pivot points above\ntheir cabin centers of gravity and passively pivoted due to gravity and inertia. During the same\nperiod, actively-controlled train cabins were designed to tilt hydraulically (Schoepf & Ritchie,\n1937), (Schoepf & Ritchie, 1937a). Although actively controlled tilting train cabins were not put\ninto operation until decades later, cabin tilting technology is now considered mature. As of 2007,\nover 5,000 tilting-cabin train cars have been produced worldwide by several suppliers (Persson,\n2007), (Khedkar, Kasav, Jadhav, Katkade, & Gunjal, 2015).\nRoller Coasters\nAlthough tilting trains can compensate for some centripetal acceleration and track cant, a\ndifferent technology was developed for trains designed to operate with high levels of centripetal\nacceleration and steep track banks, which has been primarily used for roller coasters. The first\nmodern roller coaster using tubular steel rails was developed by Karl Bacon and Edgar Morgan\nat Arrow Development for Walt Disney Productions. Their patent for this invention states the\npurpose was to, "carry passengers at high speeds with absolute safety over a path that includes\nvery sharp and highly banked curves, such as are found in a bobsled course." (Bacon & Morgan,\n1965). This technology was first instantiated in the Matterhorn Bobsled roller coaster at\nDisneyland, which began operating in 1959. Karl Bacon also patented the first "corkscrew" roller\n6\n\ncoaster using tubular steel rails, which began operating at the Knott\'s Berry Farm amusement\npark in 1975, (Bacon, 1975), (Reynolds, 1999). Variations of their looping tubular steel rail\nroller coasters continue to be used worldwide with the fastest commercial roller coaster in 2015\nbeing the Formula Rosso at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, which reaches\n240km/h (149 mph) on a 2.07km track (Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, 2015).\nLocomotion\nCurrently, nearly all trains use rotating electric motors in the cars or in the tracks to provide the\ntorque required to rotate the wheels to move the trains. The electric motors in the cars are called\nelectric traction motors and usually get their power from either diesel generators also located in\nthe cars or from electric lines that run along the track or overhead. On some trains, only cars\ndedicated for locomotion (locomotives) have electric traction motors. An example of an electric\nlocomotive currently being used is the Amtrak Cities Sprinter ACS-64. ACS-64s were adapted\nfor service in the United States for speeds up to 201 km/h (125 mph) and are being used on the\nAmtrak North East Corridor between Boston and Washington D.C. (Siemens AG, 2015).\nHowever, on some trains each car has one or more electric traction motors to distribute the force\nrequired to move the trains providing redundancy and scalability. For some trains, such as many\nroller coasters, electric motors are attached on or nearby the track and used to propel the train, at\nleast to a just beyond a high point after which gravity provides the required acceleration.\nLinear motors are becoming more popular for use on trains. Unlike traditional electric motors in\nwhich that rotor rotates inside a stator to produce a torque used to turn wheels to produce a linear\nforce, a linear motor in effect flattens the rotor and stator and directly produces a linear force\nwithout any moving parts. Linear motor are particularly attractive for magnetically levitated\ntrains in which part of the motor is attached to the bottom and/or sides of the train and the other\nhalf is attached to the track (Hellinger & Mnich, Nov. 2009).\nMagnetic Levitation\nIdeally, an ESHGF would use superconductor magnetic levitation, which would provide a\nsmooth, quiet, low friction, low-maintenance, and low energy-cost motion. The first patent for a\nlinear induction motor for driving trains was granted to Alfred Zehden in 1905 (Zehden, 1905)\nfollowed by a patent granted to Emile Bachelet for a magnetic levitation transportation apparatus\n(Bachelet, 1912). In 1969, a patent for a Maglev train that uses superconducting magnets was\ngranted to James Powell and Gordon Danby (Powell & Danby, Patent #: US003470828, 1969).\nSubsequently, with an operational speed of 430 km/h (267 mph) (without superconducting\nmagnets), 464- seat Maglev trains in Shanghai began operations in 2003 (Antlauf, Bernardeau, &\nCoates, 2004), (The Shanghai Maglev Train, 2015). The Central Japan Railway is developing a\nsuperconducting maglev train (Central Japan Railway, 2014). On April 21, 2015 on the\nYamanashi Maglev Line, an 18.4km test track, the L0 Series A07 superconducting maglev train\nran at 603 km/h (375 mph) (Guinness World Records, 2015). Although the high-speeds of\nsuperconducting maglev trains are not required by an ESHGF, the other benefits mentioned\nabove are significant.\nAnother magnetic levitation alternative for consideration is based on the Inductrack developed at\nthe Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Unlike the above technologies, which use\nelectromagnets for levitation, the Inductrack, patented by Richard Post (Post, 1998), uses\nHalbach arrays of permanent magnets for levitation (Post & Ryutov, 2000). This research was\n7\n\nsponsored in part by NASA to demonstrate the feasibility of using the Inductrack to accelerate a\nlaunch vehicle model at 10g to Mach 0.4.\nTaking the next technological step in high-speed magnetic levitation, the "StarTram" concept has\nbeen proposed as a low-cost means to put cargo in orbit using superconducting magnetic\nlevitation and linear motors (Powell J. R., Maise, Paniagua, & Rather, 2001), (Powell, Maise, &\nPellegrino, 2013). For off-Earth space settlements requiring thousands of modules, the\ndevelopment of this type of infrastructure is worth further consideration. Once demonstrated on\nEarth, it could also be used on the Moon, which requires 1/6th the escape velocity and doesn\'t\nhave an atmosphere that would significantly decelerate a launched payload, with or without\npassengers. This approach will be of extraordinary value in any significant effort to launch\npeople and cargo from the Moon. Since no propellant is required, propellant won\'t have to be\nbrought all the way from the Earth and safely landed on the Moon (or mined and processed from\nits polar craters).\n\n2.0\n\nDESIGN CONCEPT\n\nLeveraging the above centrifuge and train technologies, the following design concept describes a\nmodular ESHGF that can be initially implemented to support a few people, but can be\nincrementally extended as needed to reach a full-scale space settlement. This section begins with\na brief system overview followed by a description of each subsystem. Hypergravity implications\nare discussed in section 2.6, including its effect on system sizing. This is followed by a\ndescription of ESHGF stability considerations, modularity, system capacity, and extensibility.\n\n2.1\n\nSystem Overview\n\nThe ESHGF system consists of the HyperGravity Vehicle, Vehicle Track, Transfer Vehicle\n(optional), and Depot subsystems as shown in Figure 4, which interact as depicted in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 4: ESHGV System Top View depicted in a 3-car HGV configuration\n\n8\n\nFigure 5: System Overview\n\nEach of these subsystem are discussed further in the following subsections.\n\n2.2\n\nHyperGravity Vehicle Subsystem Overview\n\nThe HyperGravity Vehicle (HGV) subsystem is an electric train consisting of a sequence of\nconnected cars running on a track. The top view of this subsystem is shown in Figure 4 and its\nelements and their interactions are depicted in Figure 6. People will be able to move between\ncars as they can onboard a typical train.\n\nFigure 6: HGV Subsystem Overview\n\n9\n\nThe general design is for all HGV Cars (HGVC)s to be the same size, but custom-size cars can\nbe accommodated.\nThe interior of each car is expected to be customized to meet the needs of its occupants and\nmanager. Car types are expected to include at a minimum living quarters and workspace. Other\ncar types may include dining facilities, farms, aquariums, pools, arboretums, botanic gardens,\nfactories, gyms, sports center, markets, meeting rooms, etc.\nThe three major elements of each HGVC: Cabin, Chassis, and Cabin Tilt Mechanism, are\ndepicted in Figure 7 and Figure 8.\n\nFigure 7: HGVC Front View (same as Rear View)\n\nFigure 8: HGVC Side View (the same for both sides)\n\n10\n\nAn HGVC with a 24 x 4 x 4m cabin on a 300m diameter 30\xc2\xb0 superelevated (banked) track with\nan additional Cabin Pivot Angle of 30\xc2\xb0 is shown in perspective in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9: Single Cabin HGVC Perspective View\n\nAs per the third highlighted row in Table 1: Hypergravity Level Examples, to be discussed in\nsection 2.6.1, the depicted is operating on the track at 3.2 RPM and generating 1.97g. At a lower\nRPM, the Cabin Pivot Angle would be less with a corresponding lower hypergravity level.\nHGCV stability design considerations to compensate for such a steeply superelevated track and\nHGVCs with high pivot angles are also discussed.\n2.2.1 HGVC Chassis Subsystem Overview\nThe chassis is similar to a flatbed train car. It basically consists of a frame resting on two train\nwheel trucks, powered by electric traction motors, which run on a tubular rail track (see Figure\n13). Variations of the chassis include those without motors requiring another car to provide\nlocomotion. Ideally, the chassis would be magnetically levitated (maglev) to operate efficiently\nat high speeds as well as to reduce maintenance, friction, noise, and vibration, but it is not\nnecessary and the additional costs and development delays may not be justified.\n2.2.2 HGVC Cabin Subsystem Overview\nThe nominal Cabin sizes are 4m wide, 4m high, and either 12m or 24m long. These sizes were\nselected due to their similarity to train car sizes and their feasibility as analogues for off-Earth\nuse. A space-rated version of this cabin could be accommodated as a payload on a heavy-lift\nlaunch vehicle for use on orbit, in the Moon, in Mars, in the Mars\' moons. and in asteroids. By\ntaking into account space-rated cabin requirements into consideration, the ESHGF can be used as\nan analogue for such modular artificial-gravity space facilities and validating their requirements.\n\n11\n\nFigure 10: HGVC 6-room Cabin Floor Plan Example (Top View)\n\nEach cabin has a hall connected to the adjacent Car cabin(s) for people and cargo to travel the\nlength of the HGV as shown in Figure 10. This figure depicts a 6-room floor plan. However, the\nfloor plans are flexible because internal cabin walls are not load bearing and may be moved.\n2.2.3 HGVC Tilt Mechanism Subsystem Overview\nA special feature of each HGVC is its capability to control the tilt of its cabin so that it is\nrelatively level with respect to its hypergravity vector. The HGCV tilt mechanism subsystem\nenables this capability by actively controlling the tilt of the cabin with respect to the chassis\ndepending on the velocity of the HGVC. Views of the HGVC Cabin Tilt Mechanism Subsystem\nare shown in Figure 11and the subsystem elements are their interactions are depicted in Figure\n12.\n\nFigure 11: HGVC Tilt Mechanism Subsystem Top View\n(attached between chassis and cabin on each HGVC;\nblue arrows show rotations when pivoting to the right)\n\n12\n\nFigure 12: HGVC Cabin Tilt Mechanism Subsystem Side View\n\nAs shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12, as well as integrated in the HGVC in Figure 7 and Figure\n8, the HGVC Cabin Tilt Mechanism attaches the HGVC Cabin and Chassis by means of two\npivot structures and four scissor jacks. The scissor jacks are used to change the tilt of the cabin\nwith respect to the chassis. A triple transaxle is used to transfer the input torque from the electric\ntilt servo motor to the four threaded rods of the scissor jacks. The triple transaxle outputs torques\nsuch that as the left jacks are raised, the right jacks are simultaneously lowered as shown in\nFigure 11. The electric tilt motor and its servo controller precisely control tilting the cabin to the\ncommanded angle. The commanded angle is a function of the HGV velocity and the track\n(chassis) superelevation angle defined by Equation 3 discussed in 2.6.1\nThe design can accommodate additional jacks if needed and other types of cabin tilt mechanisms\ncan be used instead, e.g., hydraulic jacks, but scissor jacks have the advantage of a highly\ncontrolled relationship between the jack height and tilt degree as well as lower maintenance\nrequirements. A design alternative for the HGV velocity input to the servo controller is an\ninclinometer-signal input that the servo controller zeros by tilting the cabin.\n2.2.4 HGVC Chassis Truck Subsystem Overview\nThe cabin(s) and its tilt mechanism rest on the chassis, which is used to move the car on the track\ndiscussed in section 2.3. The chassis consists of a frame attached to two electric-traction motor\ntrucks. Each truck rides on the track and can passively rotate with respect to the chassis in order\nto stay centered on tracks. Although truck wheels may also passively rotate in response to\nanother car pushing or pulling the chassis, in this design each truck is powered by electric motors\nto increase the locomotive traction and provide redundancy. The trucks are shown in the HGVC\nchassis bottom view in Figure 13.\n\nFigure 13: HGVC Chassis Bottom View\n\n13\n\nThe two truck center-points on the chassis are the only two points on the chassis lengthwise\ncenterline that are exactly the track radius distance (measured from the track circle center to the\nupper track gauge centerline \xe2\x80\x93 see Figure 30). The equal front and rear truck offsets (WOF =\nWOR) are also depicted in the figure. These metrics are significant with respect to hypergravity\nvariations to be discussed in section 2.6.\n2.2.5 HGVC Stability Design Considerations\nThe primary HGVC stability issue that must be addressed is atypical for trains and is due to the\nhigh side loads, and in some cases negative loads, on the HGVC wheels and tracks which could\nlead to an HGVC derailing and tipping over if not engineered properly. These loads are due to\nthe steep track superelevation angle (30\xc2\xb0), the tight turn radius (150m), the high speeds (112\nmph), the pivoting cabins (+-30\xc2\xb0), the shifting cargo and passengers, and the high cabin surface\narea subject to winds. In this design, the risk of derailment is mitigated by the HGVC chassis\nwheel truck horizontal and vertical side wheels that ride on three sides of the tubular-track side\nrails as shown in Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9.\n2.2.6 Inter-HGVC Connectivity\nInitial HGV testing can be accomplished with a single HGVC. This design concept supports a\nmultiple, connected HGVs that operate on the same track. These connections may be\naccomplished by extending the HGVC chassis and using train chassis couplers and the same way\nthat most train cars are connected, but other methods may perform better. Standard train chassis\ncouplers do not take advantage of the fact that the HGV runs on a superelevated, level track with\na constant radius. Depending on the precision of the track, the HGVCs may be connected by a\nvariety of other methods that provide additional strength, rigidity, and vibration damping. The\ndetails of how the HGVCs are connected require further study and are beyond the scope of this\ndocument.\nIn addition to the chassis connector, HGVs with multiple HGVCs also require flexible vestibules\nthat provide a passageway between cabins on connected HGVCs similar to those between\npassenger train cars, but in this case the vestibules tilt with the cabins so the vestibule floor also\nis effectively level regardless of the HGV velocity. These vestibules are dependent on the\nHGVCs coupling design and further details are also beyond the scope of this document.\n\n2.3\n\nVehicle Track Subsystem Overview\n\nThe Vehicle Track subsystem is the pathway for the HGV and Transfer Vehicle and provides\nelectricity to both subsystems. Both tracks are superelevated and circular as depicted in Figure\n14. Side views of the superelevated track are shown in Figure 16 and Figure 18. As depicted in\nboth figures, a shell may be used to cover the track, HGV, and Transfer Vehicle to protect them\nfrom the weather and provide security.\nEach track has four tubular rails to carry the load and provide stability for the vehicle cars and an\nadditional rail to power the cars as is typical for the 3rd rail for electric trains. The key track\nrequirements are that the track be circular (track radius is constant), level (perpendicular to the\ngravity vector), and have a constant superelevation angle with respect to the gravity vector. The\n14\n\ntrack foundation is implemented with a reinforced steel and concrete ring to minimize track\ndeformation over time.\nAn optional augmentation to the track design concept presented is for the tracks to support\nmaglev cars to minimize their energy use, noise, vibration, and wear. At low speeds and in\nemergency cases the vehicle wheels would contact the tracks, but during nominal operations the\nvehicles do not contact the tracks other than for power. Once the HGV reaches a significant\noperating speed, the passengers will not easily detect that the cars are moving. However, they\nwill be able to detect their bodyweights and cabin content weights have increased.\nFigure 14 illustrates the ESHGV completely filled with HGVCs and the Transfer Vehicle (not to\nscale). However, the ESGV can easily be incrementally completed and operated in a minimal\nconfiguration of a single HGVC without the Transfer Vehicle.\n\nFigure 14: ESHGV System depicted in a HGV complete ring configuration\n(figure not to scale)\n\nThe HGVCs must be spaced with sufficient margin between cabins to prevent contact between\ncabins when tilted. This spacing is discussed further in appendix C.\n\n2.4\n\nTransfer Vehicle Subsystem Overview\n\nThe top view of a Transfer Vehicle aligned with a multi-car HGV is shown in Figure 14.\nThe purpose of the Transfer Vehicle is to transfer people and cargo between the Depot and the\nHGV while the HGV is running so that the HGV can indefinitely maintain a constant velocity\nand minimize disruptive hypergravity-level changes. In addition, using a Transfer Vehicle\nreduces the energy required to operate the ESHGF since the entire HGV, which can be several\ntimes the mass of the Transfer Vehicle, does not have to stop and restart every time someone or\nsomething needs to go on or come off it. The Transfer Vehicle subsystem is similar in design to a\nsingle-car HGV, as shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8, but may be shorter depending on the transfer\n15\n\ncapacity required. Also, the Transfer Vehicle may be augmented with a cabin elevator as shown\nin Figure 16.\nThe Transfer Vehicle cabin is equipped with a Retractable Vestibule for ingress and egress with\nthe HGV and two chassis Retractable Arm Locks for the Transfer Vehicle and HGV to maintain\na constant relative position while docked to each other. At least one HGVC is equipped with two\nRetractable Arm Locks and a docking port for the Transfer Vehicle Retractable Vestibule as\ndepicted in Figure 15 and Figure 16.\n\nFigure 15: Transfer Vehicle temporarily connected to HGVC Top View\n\nIn this design concept, the Transfer Vehicle and its track either can be designed for docking with\nthe HGV at its entire range of velocities and corresponding cabin pivot angles or for only\ndocking at a specific HGV velocity and cabin pivot angle. In order for the Transfer Vehicle to\ndock with the HGV at a range of velocities the Transfer Vehicle is required to elevate as well as\ntilt its cabin for docking. This is accomplished with a cabin elevator that raises and lowers the\nTransfer Vehicle cabin and its tilt mechanism as shown in Figure 16 and Figure 17.\n\nFigure 16: Transfer Vehicle Docking with HGVCs Rear Views\nin Max g Orientation (left) and Stopped Orientation (right)\n\n16\n\nFigure 17: Transfer Vehicle Side Views\nCabin Elevator Raised (left) and Lowered (right)\n\nHowever, the Transfer Vehicle is not required to elevate its cabin if it is designed only to dock\nwhen the HGV is at a specific operating speed and cabin angle as shown in Figure 18.\n\nFigure 18: Transfer Vehicle temporarily connected to HGVC Rear View\n\nA design alternative to the Transfer Vehicle Retractable Vestibule is for the entire Transfer\nVehicle Cabin to translate horizontally and vertically to directly dock with an HGV Cabin. An\nalternative to the entire Transfer Vehicle subsystem is the Hub & Spoke subsystem discussed in\nsection 2.8.3.\n\n2.5\n\nDepot / Control Center Subsystem Overview\n\nThe Depot / Control Center (DCC) subsystem (see Figure 14) controls the HGV and Transfer\nVehicle and is similar in design and function to train stations and airport terminals. The DCC\nfacilitates the ingress and egress of people, animals, plants, equipment, supplies, utilities,\n17\n\nworkproducts, waste, and data between the ESHGF and outside the system. The DCC also acts\nas a service station for the HGV and Transfer Vehicle.\n\n2.6\n\nHGV HyperGravity\n\n2.6.1 HGV HyperGravity Level\nThe hypergravity level of the HGV is the vector sum of the ambient gravity vector at the HGV\nlocation and the perpendicular centripetal-acceleration vector created by the HGV travelling in a\ncircle. The hypergravity level at a point in an HGVC cabin is a function of the track radius and\nHGVC velocity at that point and is defined by Equation 1. The HGVC Cabin coordinate frame is\ndefined with its origin at the center of the bottom of the cabin; the +x-axis runs lengthwise\ntoward the cabin front; the +y-axis runs widthwise directly opposed to the track center; and the\n+z-axis runs up toward the cabin ceiling.\nThe HGVC cabin coordinate frame changes with respect to its HGVC coordinate frame by the\ncabin pivot angle P, which changes the radii and velocities of the points in the cabin respectively\naccording to Equation 1. The cabin point velocities vary within the cabin per Equation 2, but the\noverall HGVC velocity, \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x90 , is controlled by the HGVC wheel truck.\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xaa\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa3\xe0\xaf\xa2\xe0\xaf\xa6 (\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x92 ,\xdc\xb2 ,\xdd\x96 ,\xdd\x95 ,\xdd\x94\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x90 , \xdd\x83\xe0\xaf\x94 ) =\n\n\xe0\xb6\xa8g \xe0\xac\xb6\n\xe0\xaf\x94\n\nv\xe0\xad\xae\xe0\xad\xad\xe0\xad\xb1 (x, y, z, P, v\xe0\xad\x9b )\xe0\xac\xb6\n+\xe1\x89\x86\n\xe1\x89\x87\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa3\xe0\xaf\xa2\xe0\xaf\xa6 (\xe2\x80\xab)\xdc\xb2 ,\xdd\x96 ,\xdd\x95 ,\xdd\x94\xe2\x80\xac\n9.807\n\n\xe0\xac\xb6\n\n\t\t\n\nEquation 1: Hypergravity Level\n\nv\xe0\xad\xae\xe0\xad\xad\xe0\xad\xb1 (x, y, z, P, v\xe0\xad\x9b ) =\n\nv\xe0\xad\xb5 \xe2\x88\x99 \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa3\xe0\xaf\xa2\xe0\xaf\xa6 (\xe2\x80\xab)\xdc\xb2 ,\xdd\x96 ,\xdd\x95 ,\xdd\x94\xe2\x80\xac\n\t\t\n\xe2\x80\xab\xe0\xaf\x8d\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\n\nEquation 2 : HGVC Cabin Point Velocity\n\nwhere:\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xaa\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa3\xe0\xaf\xa2\xe0\xaf\xa6 (\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x92 ,\xdc\xb2 ,\xdd\x96 ,\xdd\x95 ,\xdd\x94\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x90 ) = HGV hypergravity level in Earth gravity g\'s at the HGVC cabin\ncoordinates (x, y, z) at cabin pivot angle P at HGVC wheel truck velocity vW (Earth g)\nrT = Track Circle Radius measured from center of upper track gauge (m)\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa3\xe0\xaf\xa2\xe0\xaf\xa6 (\xe2\x80\xab = )\xdc\xb2 ,\xdd\x96 ,\xdd\x95 ,\xdd\x94\xe2\x80\xacCabin point radius at cabin coordinates (x, y, z) at cabin pivot angle P from\nHGV track circle center (m)\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa3\xe0\xaf\xa2\xe0\xaf\xa6 (\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x92 ,\xdc\xb2 ,\xdd\x96 ,\xdd\x95 ,\xdd\x94\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x90 ) = HGVC velocity at cabin coordinates (x, y, z) at P and at \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x90 (m/s)\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x90 = HGVC wheel truck velocity = HGV velocity (m/s)\nP = Cabin Pivot Axle Angle (degrees)\nga = Ambient gravity at the ESHGF location.

Hence, track\nradius rT is a rough approximation of the actual radius of an HGVC cabin point, \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa3\xe0\xaf\xa2\xe0\xaf\xa6 (\xe2\x80\xab;)\xdc\xb2 ,\xdd\x96 ,\xdd\x95 ,\xdd\x94\xe2\x80\xac\nand consequently the HGVC wheel truck velocity \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x90 is a rough approximation of the HGVC\ncabin point velocity, \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa3\xe0\xaf\xa2\xe0\xaf\xa6 (\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x92 ,\xdc\xb2 ,\xdd\x96 ,\xdd\x95 ,\xdd\x94\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x90 ). These approximations do not hold for cases in which\nthe track radius rT is small relative to the cabin width y and height z, such as for an extreme case\nin which tilting the cabin places the track circle center underneath cabin points (the velocity is 0\nfor cabin points directly over the track circle center regardless of the HGVC RPM). A precise\ndefinition of \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa3\xe0\xaf\xa2\xe0\xaf\xa6 (\xe2\x80\xab )\xdc\xb2 ,\xdd\x96 ,\xdd\x95 ,\xdd\x94\xe2\x80\xacis in Appendix B.\n\nEquation 1 is derived from the equation defining centripetal acceleration (a=v2/r), and the\nequation for adding two perpendicular vectors (Pythagorean Theorem). Note that the\nhypergravity (minus the ambient gravity) is inversely proportional to the track diameter, but is\ndirectly proportional to the square of the HGV velocity. For example, halving the track diameter\ndoubles the gravity increase due to centripetal acceleration; but doubling the HGV velocity\nquadruples the gravity due to centripetal acceleration.

For a\ngiven hypergravity level, the required HGV velocity can be reduced by decreasing the track\ndiameter, but this also increases the HGV RPM. Large track diameters increase costs and high\nHGV velocities increase risks, but high RPMs increase the likelihood and intensity of motion\nsickness and possible long-term side effects. The long-term effects of rotation on humans is not\nwell understood (excluding one revolution per day), but rates above 2-3 RPMs are known to\ncause motion sickness in a high percentage of the population when not trained or treated\naccordingly. The capability to study these long-term effects is one of the benefits of the ESHGF.\nAdditional examples are given at various HGV velocities with four different track diameters\n(100m, 250m, 300m, and 500m), at four different locations (Earth, Mars, Moon, and on-orbit)\nfor considering the ESHGF as an analogue for off-Earth artificial-gravity facilities. The on-orbit\nexample rows are provided since such an ESHGF would be similar to an orbiting space station in\na wheel configuration with spokes and connected rim modules instead of tracks and HGV cars.\nThe on-orbit examples are also similar to ESHGFs on an asteroid or Mars moon. Note that once\nthe ambient gravity of the ESHGF is reduced to the gravity level of the Moon (1.622 m/s2), the\nambient gravity has little effect on the hypergravity level (H) when the centripetal acceleration is\nseveral times higher than the ambient gravity (as shown in Table 1).\nThe optimal track diameter of 300m for this design concept is shown by the highlighted rows in\nTable 1. A design with a hypergravity level of up to 2g\xe2\x80\x99s is required to provide the capability to\ngenerate a wide range of hypergravity levels humans can live at for long periods. Smaller track\ndiameters require an RPM levels that are too high for a 2g hypergravity level. For larger\ndiameters for a 2g hypergravity level, the HGV velocities are too high as well as being more\ncostly. An HGV configured as the third highlighted row is shown in perspective in Figure 9. For\nthis example, the track is 300m diameter with a 30\xc2\xb0 superelevation and a Cabin Pivot Angle of\nan additional 30\xc2\xb0. This HGV has a hypergravity of 1.97g when running 50m/s (112mph), which\nis 3.2 RPMs. The 300m diameter is also a reasonable size for an orbiting space settlement, which\nwould generate 1g at 2.4RPMs.\nAn ESHGV can be designed with multiple concentric tracks of different diameters to support\nsimultaneously generating multiple levels of hypergravity. Multi-track ESHGF designs are\ndiscussed in 2.8.\n2.6.2 HGV Hypergravity Control\nThe hypergravity is controlled by controlling the HGV velocity per Equation 1. Consequently,\nthe hypergravity can be kept constant by maintaining a constant HGV velocity\nIn addition to controlling the hypergravity level of the HGV, the HGV controls the cabin tilt\nangle per Equation 3 so that regardless of the HGV velocity, the down direction (hypergravity\nvector) is always perpendicular to the center of the cabin floor as shown in Figure 19. The Cabin\nAngle specified in Table 1 is measured with the vertex at the center of the HGV pivot such that\nat a Cabin Angle of 0 degrees, the cabin floor is parallel with the chassis bed and track\n\n20\n\nsuperelevation. The sum of the Cabin Angle and the Track angle is the angle of the cabin floor to\nthe track circle plane, which is perpendicular to the ambient gravity vector, i.e., level.\nFor example, consider the first example in Table 1. The HGV is stopped on a track with a 30\xc2\xb0\nsuperelevation. The Cabin Angle is -30\xc2\xb0 in order to maintain the down direction perpendicular to\nthe cabin floor. This case is illustrated in Figure 19 left.\n\nFigure 19: HGV Car in Stopped Orientation (left) and Max g Orientation (right)\n\nAs the HGV velocity increases, the Cabin Angle increase until it reaches its maximum value of\n30\xc2\xb0 as depicted in Figure 19 right.\nWith a sufficiently slow HGV acceleration rate and Cabin Angle change rate, neither change will\nbe noticed by the occupants. For example, a glass of water resting on a table would appear to\nremain unchanged as the HGV accelerates and then maintains its operational velocity. The only\ndifference with regard to the glass of water is that it would become heavier.\nIn order to maintain a constant down direction at any velocity, the tilt command input is\nmaintained at the calculated cabin tilt angle, which is a function of the HGV velocity and is\ndefined by Equation 3.\n\xe0\xac\xb6\nv\xe0\xad\xb5\n180\n\xdc\xb2 = tan\xe0\xac\xbf\xe0\xac\xb5 \xe1\x89\x86\n\xe1\x89\x87 \t\t \xe2\x88\x99\n\t \xe0\xb5\x86 \xdc\xb6\xe0\xae\xbb\nr\xe0\xad\x98 \xe2\x88\x99 g \xe0\xad\x9f\n\xdf\xa8\n\nEquation 3: HGV Cabin Tilt Angle\n\nwhere:\nP = HGV Cabin Pivot Axle Angle (degrees)\nTB = Track Superelevation (Bank) Angle (degrees)\nga = Ambient gravity at the ESHGF location.\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x90 = HGVC wheel truck velocity = HGV velocity (m/s)\n\n21\n\n\xe2\x80\xab = \xe0\xaf\x8d\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xacTrack Circle Radius (m)\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x95\xe0\xaf\x9c\xe0\xaf\x94\xe0\xaf\xa6 = Track Circle Radius bias (m)\n\nThe Track Circle Radius bias is a HGVC tunable parameter, nominally between 0 and 2, that is\nused to fine-tune the cabin pivot angle since the hypergravity level does vary slightly throughout\nthe cabin as described in the next section.\n2.6.3 HGVC Cabin Gravity Map\nIdeally, the hypergravity level would be equal and constant for all points in a HGVC cabin for\nthe gravity to behave more like the way people are accustomed to on Earth and for consistency in\nexperiments. However, there will be minor gravity variations at different points in the cabin that\nare different distances from the center of the HGV track circle and consequently have different\ncentripetal accelerations and corresponding hypergravity levels. The advantage of using a large\nradius track is that these variances are minimal. In an extreme case where the track circle is so\nsmall that the track radius is zero for points in a HGVC cabin, the centripetal acceleration for an\nobject centered at such a point would also be zero. An example of an HGVC Cabin hypergravity\nfloor map illustrating these microgravity variation is shown in Figure 20.\n\nFigure 20: HGVC 24 x 4m Floor Hypergravity Map Example\n\nPertinent parameters for this example are the HGVC cabin coordinates (x, y), the Cabin Pivot\nAngle = 30\xc2\xb0, the track radius = 150m, the HGV velocity=40m/s, track superelevation angle =\n30\xc2\xb0, Cabin Pivot Center height=1m, Cabin floor height from pivot axle center=0.5m, Cabin\nlength=24m, Cabin width=4m, front & rear wheel truck offset=3m, and ambient\ngravity=9.807m/s2 (Earth); the relevance of these parameter are discussed below.\nThis hypergravity map changes with different HGV configurations and velocities, but in most\ncases the basic characteristics are similar. The hypergravity varies with the (x, y, z) position of\nan object in the HGV cabin. The lowest-hypergravity point on the cabin floor is at the middle of\nthe cabin where the floor meets the inner wall, i.e., position (0, -2). The hypergravity at this\nposition for this example is 1.466g\'s, so a 1kg mass at this position would weigh 1.466kg.\nHowever, the hypergravity at both outer corners, positions (-12, 2) & (12, 2), is 1.479g\'s, so a\n1kg mass at both of those locations would weigh 1.479kg, 13 grams more, an increase of ~1%.\nIn most cases, a variation of 1% would not be noticeable, but it is a design consideration. This\nvariation increases considerably on smaller diameter tracks. Although the floor is flat, water\n22\n\nwould tend to flow and balls would tend to roll away from the inside center to the outside corners\nof the cabins, with an asymmetric bias toward the rear outside corner since any object moving\naway from the track circle center will gain momentum in the process. This effect is less within\neach cabin room since they are smaller.\nThe length, width, and height of the HGVC Cabin all effect these variations. A person moving\ndirectly across a cabin from its outside wall to its inside wall also moves further toward the\ncenter of the track circle and reduces the person\'s rotation radius. By increasing the sum of the\ntrack superelevation angle and cabin pitch angle to 90\xc2\xb0 such that the cabin floor is perpendicular\nto the track plane, a change in width position will no longer cause a change in hypergravity.\nHowever, such a configuration is only appropriate in a microgravity environment such as an\norbiting space settlement. Reducing the width of the HGVC Cabin will also reduce this variance,\nbut this also can be accomplished by creating narrower rooms within the HGVCs as needed.\nSince the cabins are straight instead of arced with the same radius as the track, moving toward\nthe length center of a cabin also moves further toward the center of the track and reduces the spin\nradius (each cabin is a chord of the track circle \xe2\x80\x93 see Figure 13 & Figure 31). This variance can\nbe mitigated by arcing the floor and shortening the HGVC cabin length or cabin room lengths.\nThe hypergravity level changes as an object is raised in the Cabin, i.e., an object on a table in the\ncabin will weigh less than the same object on the floor directly below it (with respect to the\nCabin coordinate frame). Since the Cabin is tilted toward the track circle center, increasing the\nheight of an object decreases its track circle radius and its corresponding centripetal acceleration.\n\n2.7\n\nESHGF Modularity\n\nA key feature of the ESHGF is its modularity. Each module, comparable to intermodal shipping\ncontainers, can be transported by rail, truck, ship, and aircraft as shipping containers currently\nare transported. The size of these modules are also feasible for heavy lift launch vehicles. If\nnecessary, the ESHGF Cars and/or Modular Cabins can be separated, transported, and reattached\nat their destination. When being transported, in some cases the self-leveling tilt mechanism can\nbe activated to mitigate lateral acceleration during transport as needed to protect the contents and\nto enable the continued operation of the Cabins during transport. Also, ESHGF Cabins and Cars\ncan be added as needed to increase system capacity, as well as be removed for maintenance, to\nbe upgraded, or replaced with modules tailored for different purposes.\n\n2.8\n\nESHGF System Capacity and Extensibility\n\nSignificant artificial-gravity research can be accomplished with a single HGVC, but with the\ngoal to ultimately create a scalable space habitat to support a permanent space community in\nexcess of 1000 people, the ESHGF can be incrementally expanded to support such populationsizes as well as habitats for a wide variety of plants and animals.\nThe modular characteristic of the ESHGF design enables the system capacity to be incrementally\nincreased as needed. The design presented focuses on a 300m diameter track, but as discussed\npreviously, other track sizes may be implemented. Capacity can be increased in a number of\nways. In this section, the following methods to increase capacity are presented: increasing the\n\n23\n\nnumber of Cabins per HGVC, increasing the number of HGVCs per track, and increasing the\nnumber of concentric tracks.\n2.8.1 HGV Population Density\nThe population density of the HGV can vary significantly based on the operations concept. An\nHGV could be operated unmanned as the lower bound of population density. An upper bound for\nconsideration is provided by the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 46 - Shipping which\npermits up to one person per each 0.9m2 of deck area (U.S. Federal Government, 2011).\nHowever, a cruise ship may provide a more reasonable estimate for long-term population\ndensity. A population density analysis of a small sample of Royal Caribbean cruise ships is\nshown in Table 2. More on these cruise ships at: (Royal Carribean International, 2015).\n\nShip Name\nAdventure of the Seas\nMariner of the Seas\nNavigator of the Seas\nFreedom of the Seas\n\nMax.\nPassengers\n& Crew\n5,020\n5,020\n5,364\n5,740\n\nTotal\nDeck Area\n(m2)\n137,000\n145,000\n137,000\n165,000\n\nDeck Area\nper Person\n(m2)\n27\n29\n26\n29\n\nReference\n(Kable Intelligence Limited, 2015)\n(Cybercruises.com, 2003)\n(Trauthwein, 2003)\n(MarineLink.com, 2005)\n\nTable 2: Cruise Ship Population Density Examples\n\nBased on an average cruise ship population density of 28m2 per person, a corresponding HGV\npopulation at the same density is 3.43 people per single cabin car. In the following section,\nmulti-cabin cars are presented that increase the population up to 48 people per car, at the same\ndensity depending on the number of cabins added.\n2.8.2 Multi-Cabin HGVCs\nMultiple cabins can be attached to a single HGVC to increase the HGV capacity and to generally\nreduce the path distance between two points in different cabins compared to cabins configured\nlinearly on single-cabin HGVCs.\nThe simplest multi-cabin HGVC has a second cabin on top of the first as illustrated in Figure 21.\nThis configuration doubles the HGVC deck area to 192m2 (2,067 sq. ft.) without increasing the\nchassis size.\nThis figure also illustrates the ESHGF can be implemented in circular tunnel, similar to a\nsubway, instead of using a track shell. This is a more realistic analogue for an artificial-gravity\nfacility on Mars, a moon, or an asteroid, which would benefit from the shielding and thermal\ninsulation being underground provides. If Tunnel Boring Machines (Maidl, Schmid, Ritz, &\nHerrenknecht, 2008) (Zhao, 2012) are used for mining in these locations, the tunnels they leave\nbehind can be used for artificial-gravity settlements.\n\n24\n\nFigure 21: 2-Story HGVC docking with a Transfer Vehicle on a Tunnel Track\n\nOnce HGVCs with one or two cabins have been validated, HGVCs with many more cabins can\nbe deployed by increasing the HGVC chassis width and track gauge as needed to accommodate\nthe loads of the cabins and their contents. Additional rails can be added if needed as well.\nMultiple views of a 26 cabin, chassis HGVC configuration are shown in and Figure 22 and\nFigure 23. In Figure 22, side-by-side perspective views of this 26-Cabin HGVC on a 300m\ndiameter 30\xc2\xb0 superelevated track are shown. The left view illustrates the HGVC stopped for\nloading with a Cabin Pivot Angle of -30\xc2\xb0. The right view illustrates the same HGVC with a\nCabin Pivot Angle of 30\xc2\xb0 required for 2g of hypergravity.\n\nFigure 22: 26-Cabin HGVC on Track Perspective View\nStopped (left) and at 2g orientation (right)\n\n25\n\nThis 26-Cabin HGVC is sized to be suitable as an analogue of one of the 36 10\xc2\xb0 arc rim\nsegments required for a fully-implemented 300m dia. wheel-shaped space settlement, such as\nthose depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 3. This is also a 2-story configuration in which the two\ncenter cabins, mounted directly above the HGVC chassis, are 24 x 4 x 4m in size. The remaining\n24 cabins are half the length (12 x 4 x 4m). Openings and stairways between these cabins can be\nadded as needed. The floor space for this configuration for each HGVC is 1344m2 (14,467\nsq. ft.).\n\nPerspective View\n\nTop View\n\nFront View\n\nSide View\nFigure 23: 26-Cabin HGVC Views\n\nThe tracks and the HGV chasses can be designed to support the loads as needed. In most cases,\nthe 4-rail track described in this design concept should be sufficient. The HGVC design specifies\n10 wheels per wheel truck and 2 wheel trucks per chassis (Figure 13). To provide context, cargo\ntrains are currently operational that support 40,000kg per 2-wheel axle (Kirk, 2008).\n\n26\n\n2.8.3 ESHGF Hub-and-Spoke Subsystem Architecture\nAn alternative to the Transfer Vehicle is a rotating Hub-and-Spoke subsystem in which the Hub\nis located at the center of the concentric tracks and rotates at the same velocity as the HGV. This\narchitecture is a closer analogue to that of an orbiting space settlement. Figure 24 depicts a single\nHGV consisting of 36 HGVCs, each with 26 cabins as defined in section 2.8.2. To accommodate\nthese HGVCs, a 315m diameter track is required (see Appendix C). With each HGVC vertically\noriented such that the top faces the track center, as would be the case for an on-orbit\nimplementation, the spacing between the HGVCs would be reduced, reducing the overall\ndiameter to 300m.\n\nFigure 24: Single Ring 26-Cabin 36-HGVC ESHGF Top View\n\nThe total cabin deck area of this configuration is 48,384m2 (520,801ft2), excluding the Spoke\narea and not accounting for deck area lost to accommodate Spoke connections. This deck area\nsupports a population of 1,728 at cruise ship density. Note that this configuration can be\nimplemented incrementally, one cabin or one HGVC at a time.\nAs depicted in Figure 24, each Spoke projects from the Hub and attaches to HGVCs. Figure 24\nshows the Spokes connecting to the end of the cabins to simplify the illustration, but designs that\nentail the removal of some HGVC cabins and connecting each Spoke directly to an HGVC\nchassis at its midpoint or between two adjacent HGVCs at their vestibule passageway are viable\n\n27\n\nalternatives. Several methods to attach the Spokes to the HGVCs are feasible and require further\nanalysis. The Spoke/HGVC connection design is beyond the scope of this document.\nWithin each Spoke are passageways to transfer people, animals, plants, and supplies between the\nHub and HGVC as does the Transfer Vehicle. Each 4m-wide Spoke provides ample room for a\npair of tilting elevators (or escalators), a cargo cart passageway, and a service passageway as\nwell as conduits for wires, fibers, and pipes to transfer power, data, and fluids respectively. The\nSpokes may be supported by trollies running on concentric tracks underneath them and by\nsuspension cables from the Hub peak as needed.\nThe Hub-and-Spoke subsystem can also support multiple HGVs in concentric rings as shown in\nFigure 25. An ESHGF with multiple rings has the advantages of increasing capacity as well as\nproviding an increased variance in hypergravity and rotation radii to better characterize their\ndifferent effects. Also, an orbiting space settlement may require multiple gravity levels to\nsupport crew and visitors preparing for or recovering from low-gravity environment missions.\nFigure 25 depicts three concentric HGVs consisting of a total of 72 HGVCs, each with 26 cabins.\nThe outer HGV is identical to the 36 car HGV shown in Figure 24. By adding two concentric\nHGVs, one with 24 HGVCs and the other with 12 HGVCs, the capacity is doubled. The total\ncabin deck area of this configuration is 96,768m2 (1,041,601ft2). This supports a population of\n3,456 at cruise ship density.\nSimilar to a rotating restaurant on a tower, the central Hub either can be designed to entirely\nrotate on a small concentric track of trolleys or be designed as a cylinder rotating around a\nstationary vertical axle. At rotation rates of 2-3RPM transitioning between the rotating and\nstationary portions of the Hub would be similar to getting on and off an escalator. The Hub can\nbe connected to the MCC by a tunnel under the ESHGF and/or a bridge.\nThe Hub-and-Spoke subsystem has the advantage of allowing a continuous flow of people,\nanimals, plants and supplies on and off the ESHGF as needed. Also, it provides a closer analogue\nto an off-Earth artificial-gravity facility in which the Hub would be at the ambient gravity of the\nESHGF location, e.g., microgravity on orbit, and Mars gravity on Mars.\n\n28\n\nTop View with all HGVCs at a horizontal orientation (1g)\n\nSide View of the 6 HGVCs on opposing Spokes at 3.1 RPM operation orientations\nFigure 25: Triple Ring 26-Cabin 72-HGVC ESHGF\n\n29\n\n2.8.4 ESHGF Hub-and-Spoke Shell\nUnlike the torus shell or tunnel that can be used to protect an HGV that uses a Transfer Vehicle,\nas shown in Figure 16, a different shell design is required for the optional but recommended shell\nfor a Hub-and-Spoke ESHGF. This shell design uses flexible stadium roofing material. However,\nunlike stadiums which do not use a center support, The ESHGF uses a stationary 45m tower at\nthe center ESHGF hub, essentially acting as the axle that the hub ring rotates around, to support\nthe roof. Suspension cables attach from the center tower peak to a circular outer wall that\nsurrounds the ESHGF on the other end. The combination of the center tower, the suspension\ncables, and the 350m dia. x 10m high outer wall support the that ESHGF roofing material as\ndepicted in Figure 26. This exterior is suitable for housing the Triple Ring 26-Cabin 72-HGVC\nESHGV shown in Figure 25.\n\nFigure 26: ESHGF Exterior for a Hub-and-Spoke HGV with a 315m dia. Track\n\nThe interior of the ESHGV can also be slightly pressurized to provide additional support.\n2.8.5 ESHGF Hub-and-Spoke Subsystem Incremental Implementation\nThe ESHGF Hub-and-Spoke Subsystem can be incrementally implemented in a variety of\nconfigurations. Incremental implementation of an ESHGF on Earth can also be used to reflect\nhow an on-orbit artificial-gravity facility may be incrementally implemented to help mitigate its\ndevelopment risks. The following figures illustrate how different configurations of 26-Cabin\nHGVCs can be extended. Similarly, the number of cabins for each HGVs can be incrementally\nincreased starting with single-cabin HGVCs.\n\n30\n\nFigure 27: ESHGF Incremental Implementation with 26-Cabin HGVCs in \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99 Configuration Top View\nImplementations: 2-HGVC (top), 10-HGVC (bottom)\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x9d configuration shown in Figure 27, also referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cdumbbell\xe2\x80\x9d configuration, is a\n2-Spoke configuration that is a relatively low-cost and is a reasonable configuration when lowcapacity is suitable. This configuration has a disadvantage when implemented on-orbit that the\nlengthwise axis is not stabilized when it rotates about the Hub (Sanyal, Shen, McClamroch, &\nBloch, 2005). However, this can be passively mitigated by adding HGVCs at the outer end of\neach Spoke as shown in the bottom of Figure 27.\n\n31\n\nFigure 28: ESHGF Incremental Implementation with 26-Cabin HGVCs in \xe2\x80\x98Y\xe2\x80\x99 Configuration Top View\nImplementations: 3-HGVC (top), 15-HGVC (bottom)\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x98Y\xe2\x80\x99 configuration shown in Figure 28 is a 3-Spoke configuration that has the benefit of\nbeing spin-stabilized in all three axes when rotated. Also, on-orbit two \xe2\x80\x98Y\xe2\x80\x99 configurations can be\ncombined into a single 6-Spoke configuration as shown in Figure 25 or attached at their hubs and\ncounter-rotated to keep the net angular momentum of the combined facility near zero regardless\nof the rotation rate. This has the benefit of not requiring propellant to despin if necessary.\n\n32\n\nFigure 29: ESHGF Incremental Implementation with 26-Cabin HGVCs in \xe2\x80\x98X\xe2\x80\x99 Configuration Top View\nImplementations: 4-HGVC (top), 12-HGVC (middle), 34-HGVC (bottom)\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x98X\xe2\x80\x99 configuration shown in Figure 29 is a 4-Spoke configuration that has the benefit of\nbeing spin-stabilized in all three axes when rotated as is the \xe2\x80\x98Y\xe2\x80\x99 configuration. It also supports a\nhigh-density of HGVCs when increased capacity is desired. An \xe2\x80\x98X\xe2\x80\x99 configuration can be created\nby combining two \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99 configurations when needed. A 6-Spoke configuration can be created by\ncombining a 4-Spoke \xe2\x80\x98X\xe2\x80\x99 configuration with a 2-Spoke \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99 configuration.\n33\n\n3.0\n\nCONCEPT OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe ESHGF can be operated in a number of ways (use concepts) as well as operated in different\nconfigurations at different development stages. This section concludes with day-in-the-life\nexamples.\n\n3.1\n\nOperation Mode Concepts\n\nThe operation mode concepts are summarized in Table 3, each of which is discussed in this\nsection.

The HGV may also be tested in this mode on a commercial track.\nIn the ESHGF, the HGV can be used to characterize the short-term effects of the HGV on\nobjects, animals, and plants prior to a HGV being used by humans.\n\n34\n\n3.1.2 Unoccupied long-term operation mode\nThe HGV, or a subset of its HGVCs, can be used to characterize the long-term effects of\nhypergravity and low-RPM high-radius rotation on objects, manufacturing processes, animals,\nand plants without requiring the presence of humans, e.g., perform science regarding the multigenerational effects of hypergravity on plants, fish, birds, mammals, etc....\n3.1.3 Occupied short-term operation mode\nOnce the HGV has been tested without humans and certified as safe for human occupancy for\nshort-terms, the HGV can be used to evaluate short-term hypergravity effects on humans.\nThe HGV can also be used for demonstrating the system capabilities for short-term visitors.\nHigh-density population HGVCs may be dedicated for this purpose.\nWhen the entire HGV is operated in this mode, the Transfer Vehicle is not required since the\nentire HGV can stop at the DCC for loading and unloading.\n3.1.4 Continuous operation with short tours of duty mode\nA primary purpose of this mode is to study the hypergravity/rotation effect on people such that\nthe tours of duty can be safely extended to indefinite durations.\nAssuming that by performing short-term tests on people it is determined that there is a\ntherapeutic benefit for people to undergo hypergravity for short periods, the HGV could be used\nin this mode to perform such treatments, e.g., strength building, osteoporosis mitigation, and\nextended microgravity rehabilitation.\nThis mode also can be used for HGVCs being used for the unoccupied, long-term operation\ndescribed in 3.1.2, but tasks requiring humans for short-terms are needed, e.g., perform animal\nexaminations and maintenance that can be performed during operation.\nAnother purpose for this mode is to study the periodic effects of hypergravity on humans. For\nexample, an experiment may characterize any differences in the effects of hypergravity between\ntwo groups of people; one group who for 180 days alternates between being onboard the HGV\nfor 7 days then off for 7 days compared with the other group which alternates between being\nonboard for 12 hours then off for 12 hours each day for the same 180-day period.\n3.1.5 Continuous operation with long tours of duty mode\nA primary purpose of this mode, supporting long tours of duty, is to characterize the long-term\nhypergravity/rotation effects on people, animals, and plants to determine if they can live\nindefinitely in long-radii rotating artificial-gravity facilities as well as to determine if there are\nlong-term benefits to living in a hypergravity environment. If such benefits do exist, then these\nfacilities can be used for therapy.\nAlso, an HGV in this mode can be used as an analogue to study and experience what life might\nbe like in long-radii rotating artificial-gravity settlements orbiting Earth, on the Moon, on EarthMars cycler orbits (McConaghy, Longuski, & Byrnes, 2002), and on Mars and its moons.\n35\n\n3.2\n\nESHGF Configurations\n\nThe extensible, modular design of the ESHGF supports it being operated in a wide variety of\nconfigurations in which its capabilities can be incrementally implemented over time. The\nfollowing configurations are listed in the proposed order of development.\n3.2.1 Single-Car Single-Cabin HGV Initial Checkout on Commercial Track\nThe simplest configuration is a single HGVC with a single cabin that runs on a commercial\ntrack. The basic concepts and systems of the HGVC can be tested prior to building the ESHGV\ntrack.\n3.2.2 Single-Car Single-Cabin HGV on ESHGV Track\nThe next configuration is to run the single-cabin HGVC on the superelevated circular ESHGV\ntrack.\n3.2.3 Multi-Car Single-Cabin HGV\nThis configuration includes all HGVs with multiple single-cabin HGVCs. In the maximum\nimplementation of this configuration, the HGVCs fill the entire circular track and are connected\nsuch that the first HGVC in the front of the HGV is connected to its rear HGVC forming a ring\nof HGVCs.\n3.2.4 Multi-Car Single-Cabin HGV with Transfer Vehicle\nAs the capacity of the HGV increases, implementing a Transfer Vehicle and track in the ESHGF\nmay be warranted. As discussed in section 2.3, a Transfer Vehicle can be used to efficiently\ntransfer people and cargo on and off the HGV without stopping the HGV. Doing so is less\ndisruptive for HGV operations and less costly by reducing the energy and maintenance costs\nwith stopping and starting the entire HGV.\n3.2.5 Single-Car Multi-Cabin HGV\nAnother configuration option to increase capacity is to add modular cabins to a HGVC. A 26cabin HGVC is discussed and depicted in figures in section 2.8.2. However, a wide variety of\nmulti-cabin HGVC configurations are feasible and can be implemented so that they can be\nreconfigured and/or upgraded on demand.\nMulti-cabin HGVC configurations facilitate larger habitable spaces, shorter point-to-point\ndistances compared to multiple single cabin HGVCs with the same volume, and provide more\nvariation in rotation radii and hypergravity due to cabin points being further from the track gauge\ncenter.\nA multi-cabin HGVC can also be configured to more closely replicate a potential rim section of\nan orbiting settlement when being used as a space settlement analogue.\n\n36\n\n3.2.6 Multi-Car Multi-Cabin HGV\nJust as multiple single-cabin HGVCs can be configured as discussed in section 3.2.3, capacity\ncan be increased with multiple multi-cabin HGVCs. It also facilitates both HGVC specialization\nand the simultaneous operation of different multi-cabin HGVC configurations for comparison.\n3.2.7 Multi-Car Multi-Cabin HGV with Transfer Vehicle\nThe purpose and configuration of a Multi-Cabin HGVC are similar to those of a single-cabin\nHGVC and Transfer Vehicle as discussed in section 3.2.4 except that the capacity of each HGVC\nis increased. An example of a 2-Cabin HGVC with a Transfer Vehicle is shown in Figure 21.\n3.2.8 Multi-Car Multi-Cabin HGV with Hub & Spokes\nAssuming that the benefits of an ESHGV are confirmed using a single-car HGV, a multi-car\nmulti-cabin HGV with a central Hub & Spokes configuration, as described in section 2.8.2, is\nrecommended to increase HGV capacity and its flexibility to continuously transfer people on and\noff the HGV, as well as to obtain a closer analogue to an orbiting space settlement,. This\nconfiguration can be incrementally implemented by operating the ESHGV in some of the\nconfigurations described above first.\n\n3.3\n\nESHGV Use Case Examples\n\nThis section describes the operation of an ESHGV with two use case examples.\n3.3.1 Short-Term Occupied Mode with Single-Cabin Single-Car HGV\nThe HGV is sitting on a 30\xc2\xb0 superelevated track parked next to the DCC. The single HGVC\ncabin is pivoted at a -30\xc2\xb0 so that the cabin floor is level. A retractable bridge (similar to an\nairport jetway) is extended from the DCC to the HGV. The cargo is loaded followed by the\nloading of the crew and passengers who proceed to their assigned rooms. Once loaded, the HGV\ndoor is sealed and the DCC bridge is retracted.\nA brief announcement over the intercom informs the passengers that the HGV is embarking and\nthat they will reach the operating hypergravity level of 1.5g\xe2\x80\x99s in 10 minutes. Unlike an airplane,\nat all times the people are free to continue to move about the HGV. The HGV slowly accelerates\nat a rate that is barely perceptible to the passengers and the HGVC cabin pivot angle also slowly\nincreases and is not perceptible. The passengers eating in the cafe continue dining without taking\nnotice. The beverage glasses resting on the tables give no indication that the entire cabin is tilting\nas the HGV accelerates. After 10 minutes, the HGV cabin hypergravity is 1.5g\xe2\x80\x99s and the cabin\npivot angle is now 30\xc2\xb0. Combined with the 30\xc2\xb0 track back angle, the cabin floor angle is 60\xc2\xb0 with\nrespect to the ground, but it seems level to all onboard. Just after the HGV reaches its operation\nspeed, a passenger in the cafe notes that his glass does feel heavier since it now weighs 50%\nmore as well as his arm. Another passenger notes that she feels like she is wearing armor when\nshe stands up as the passengers begin to adjust to the hypergravity they are experiencing.\nAfter a full day of operation, another announcement over the intercom informs the passengers\nthat the HGV will be stopping in 10 minutes and to prepare to disembark. The HGV slowly\nbegins to decelerate at an imperceptible rate, e.g., 0.07m/s2. Simultaneously, the Cabin also\nbegins to pivot back to -30\xc2\xb0 also at an imperceptible rate of 0.1\xc2\xb0 per second such that the Cabin\n37\n\nstops pivoting at the same moment the HGV stops at the DCC. The DCC bridge is extended to\nthe HGV and the passengers and their cargo then disembark as the HGV is prepared for its next\ntour. As the passengers leave they feel like they are practically floating as their bodies begin to\nreadjust to the lower gravity of Earth.\n3.3.2 Multi-Cabin Multi-Car Nominal HGV Operations with a Transfer Vehicle\nThe HGV is configured and operates like a small cruise ship with office and manufacturing areas\nto continuously support 200 crew and passengers who live and work there continuously for\nmonths along with a stream of daily visitors. In addition, the HGV is configured with life science\nareas devoted to raising and studying generations of plants and animals subject to hypergravity\nand rotation. Medical areas are also devoted to ensuring the safety of all onboard as well as\nstudying the hypergravity and rotation effects on the people. All the HGVCs are two Cabins high\nproviding two decks. There are several large openings between these two decks to provide a\nmore spacious atmosphere as well as support having rooms with balconies on the second deck\nand space for trees to grow from the first deck into the second deck Cabins.\nThe Transfer Vehicle is scheduled for over 10 trips per day to load and unload people and cargo\non the HGV while the HGV speed remains constant. For each trip, the Transfer Vehicle stops at\nthe DCC; people and cargo unload followed by the loading of people and cargo on their way to\nthe HGV. A water tank located in the Transfer Vehicle chassis is also loaded and a sewage tank\nis unloaded as needed. The Transfer Vehicle disembarks and within 10 minutes it reaches the\noperational velocity of the HGV and prepares to dock by matching the pivot angle of its cabin to\nthe pivot angle of the HGVC it is docking with. As the Transfer Vehicle extends its forward\nretractable arm lock and slowly approaches the target HGVC from the rear, the HGVC extends\nits forward retractable arm lock to lock with the forward retractable arm lock of the approaching\nTransfer Vehicle. Once the two front arms make contact and lock, the rear retractable arm locks\non both vehicles are extended and locked. These locks are designed to secure both cabins to each\nother while docking, but for safety reasons either vehicle can unilaterally disengage these locks\nin an emergency. Once both pairs of retractable arm locks are locked, a retractable vestibule is\nextended from the Transfer Vehicle to the HGVC Cabin and the transfer of people and cargo\nbetween the two vehicles begins. In addition, underneath this vestibule pipes are connected and\nthe transfer of water and sewage commences. This docked configuration of a Transfer Vehicle\nwith a single-cabin HGVC is illustrated in Figure 15, Figure 18, and Figure 14.\nAfter 10 minutes, the vehicles prepare to undock. The fluid transfer pipes are disconnected and\nthe retractable vestibule is retracted followed by the unlocking and retraction of the two pairs of\nretractable arm locks. Once undocked, the Transfer Vehicle decelerates over the next 5 minutes\nand stops at the DCC where it repeats this process.\n\n38\n\n4.0\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe design concept for an extensible, modular, Extended-Stay HyperGravity Facility (ESHGF)\nwas presented. The primary purpose of the ESHGF is to produce a flexible suite of precursor\nfacilities suitable for researching the feasibility of extending the permanent presence of life\nbeyond Earth in artificial-gravity settlements. but an ESHGF will provide a variety of other\nbenefits as well. The ESHGF produces an adjustable hypergravity in a 300m diameter rotating\nenvironment for people to work and live in along with animals and plants for long-term periods.\nTwo key features of this environment is that the interior of the rotating facility is effectively both\nmotionless and level with respect to its occupants and cargo while the hypergravity is generated.\nThe design consists of modules that can be assembled and disassembled as needed to be\ntransported, to change system capacity, to change module purposes, and to upgrade/maintain\nmodules while keeping the overall system operational. The modules are sized for transport,\nincluding transport by heavy-lift launch vehicles for operation off-Earth.\nFor this design concept, an incremental implementation approach is recommended starting with a\nsingle-car hypergravity vehicle with a 24 x 4 x 4m cabin on a 300m diameter 30\xc2\xb0 superelevated\ntrack as depicted in in Figure 9 capable of a hypergravity range of 1-2g. Additional cars can be\nadded along with adding additional cabins to each car to approach a high-fidelity groundanalogue of a hub-and-spoke space settlement as shown in Figure 24 and Figure 25.\nIn conclusion, in order to enable long-term human missions off-Earth, the National Academies\nInstitute of Medicine committee recommended for NASA to focus on giving, \xe2\x80\x9cincreased priority\nto understanding, mitigating, and communicating to the public the health risks of long-duration\nmissions beyond Earth orbit\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cusing more extensively analog environments that already\nexist and that have yet to be developed;\xe2\x80\x9d (Committee on Creating a Vision for Space Medicine\nDuring Travel Beyond Earth Orbit, Board on Health Sciences Policy, 2001). Implementing\nartificial-gravity settlements and understanding their effects on life appear to be crucial for\npermanently extending life beyond Earth. The International Academy of Astronautics Study\nGroup on artificial gravity recommended that, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most efficient means of developing an\neffective flight artificial gravity countermeasure is by appropriate and timely use of ground\nfacilities\xe2\x80\x9d (International Academy of Astronautics, 2009). An NRC report on the NASA Space\nTechnology Roadmaps states, \xe2\x80\x9cThe panel identified Artificial Gravity Evaluation/\nImplementation as a game-changing capability that would greatly mitigate many adverse health\neffects that would otherwise occur during long-duration habitation in transit (or Earth orbit).\xe2\x80\x9d\n(NASA Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities: Restoring NASA\'s Technological Edge and\nPaving the Way for a New Era in Space, 2012, p. 195). An ESHGV implemented on Earth is a\nrational next step for extending the permanent presence of life beyond Earth.\n\n39\n\nREFERENCES\nAmgueddfa Cymru \xe2\x80\x94 National Museum Wales.

This distance, e.g., radius for a given cabin floor\npoint (x, y, CFT) coordinate at Cabin Pivot angle P, is defined by Equation 4 (the HGVC Cabin\ncoordinate frame is defined in section 2.6.1 and depicted in Figure 20).\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa3\xe0\xaf\xa2\xe0\xaf\xa6 (\xe2\x80\xab = )\xdc\xb2 ,\xdd\x96 ,\xdd\x95 ,\xdd\x94\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xb6\xa5\xe2\x80\xab \xdd\x94\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xac\xb6 + (\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e + \xe0\xaf\x8d\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xae\xbb + \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xae\xbc\xe0\xaf\x88 + \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x89 (\xe2\x80\xab))\xdc\xb2 ,\xdd\x96 ,\xdd\x95\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xac\xb6 \t\n\nEquation 4: Cabin Point Radius at cabin coordinates (x, y, z) at Pivot Angle P (m)\n\nSuperelevating the track by angle TB has the effect of shifting the cabin pivot-axle centerline\ntoward the track center by \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xae\xbb per Equation 5.\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xae\xbb = \xe0\xb5\x86\tsin(\xdc\xb6\xe0\xae\xbb \t \xe2\x88\x99 \t\xdf\xa8/180) \xe2\x88\x99\t\xdc\xb2\xe0\xaf\x9b\n\nEquation 5: Track Superelevation (Bank) Angle Radius Offset (m)\n\n45\n\nSimilarly, pivoting the Cabin by angle P, in addition to the track superelevation angle \xdc\xb6\xe0\xae\xbb , also\nhas the effect of shifting cabin point radii.

In the case\nwhen the sum of the track superelevation angle and the cabin pivot angle is 90\xc2\xb0, i.e., when the\ncabin floor is perpendicular to the track circle plane, the pivot angle radius offset is equal to the\n46\n\ncabin floor height from the pivot axle, see Figure 30. For a \xe2\x80\x9csecond-story cabin,\xe2\x80\x9d this height is\nincreased by the height of the first-story cabin. The hypergravity in the second story cabin\ndecreases accordingly.\nThe chassis centerline center offset is due to the chassis and cabin being straight lengthwise and\nnot being arced at same radius as the track. Consequently, the chassis lengthwise centerline\nforms a chord intersecting the track circle as illustrated in Figure 13, where the each truck centerpoint is the track radius from the track circle center. The chassis centerline offset is essentially\nthe chord height measured midway between the chassis truck centers.\n\n47\n\nAPPENDIX C: HGVC TRACK CAPACITY\nThe maximum number of HGVCs that can fit on a circular track is a function of the track radius,\nthe maximum track-circle incursion distance, the HGVC length at this distance, and the\nminimum cabin spacing margin, \xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa5\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa6\xe0\xaf\xa0 , between HGVCs (to avoid collisions between the top inner\nrear corner of a cabin on an HGVC and the top inner front corner of a cabin on the immediately\nfollowing HGVC as shown in Figure 14) when pivoting the cabins. The problem is essentially to\nmaximize n for an n-gon:\n\nFigure 31: Maximum Dodecagon in a Circle\n\nFigure 31 depicts a Dodecagon (12-sided n-gon) with its vertices on a circle. The length of each\nside c, with both vertices on the circle, can be calculated using the law of cosines, c2 = a2 + b2 2ab cos(C).

For the multi-cabin HGVC shown in Figure 23 with each Cabin\n4m high, 4m wide, and the side Cabins 12m long, \xe2\x80\xab\xe0\xaf\x8d\xdc\xa5\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x81 = 2\xc2\xb74=8m, and \xe2\x80\xab\xe0\xaf\x8d\xdc\xa5\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x90 = 4 + 2\xc2\xb712=28m. For\na 300m diameter track with a superelevation angle, TB=30\xc2\xb0, a Pivot Axle height of \xdc\xb2\xe0\xaf\x9b =3.4m, and\na Cabin Pivot Offset \xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa5\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x89\xe0\xaf\x88 = 1.5m, the Pivot Angle that maximizes the Cabin incursion into the\n\n49\n\ntrack circle is PImx = 4.16\xc2\xb0 per Equation 10 and the maximum radius corner incursion offset is \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x82\n= 18.3m per Equation 11, but for a 4x4x24m single-cabin HGVC, PImx = 36\xc2\xb0 and the incursion\noffset \xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x82 \t= 5.2m. Consequently per Equation 9, with a minimum Cabin length margin \xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa5\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x85\xe0\xaf\xa0 =\n0.25m, the maximum number of multi-cabin HGVCs that will fit on the track is nmx = 34, with a\nCabin spacing minimum of \xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa5\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa6\xe0\xaf\xa0 = 29cm per Equation 12. Similarly the maximum number of the\nsingle-cabin HGVCs on a 300m dia. track is nmx = 37 with a Cabin spacing minimum of \xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa5\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa6\xe0\xaf\xa0 =\n56cm.\nIn the above example, only 34 of the specified multi-cabin HGVCs will fit on a 300m dia. track.\nIf the system is designed such that \xdc\xb2\xe0\xaf\x82\xe0\xaf\xa0\xe0\xaf\xab + \t \xdc\xb6\xe0\xae\xbb = 90\xc2\xb0, that is the HGVCs Cabins are always\nperpendicular to the rotation plane as would be the case on-orbit and on low-gravity bodies like\nthe Moon, 36 HGVCs would fit in a 300m diameter circle. On Earth, 36 of the same size HGVCs\nrequire a 315m track diameter, i.e., \xe2\x80\xab5.751 = \xe0\xaf\x8d\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xacm, per Equation 9, due to the maximum cabin\nincursion offset of 18.36m per Equation 11.
