The mirror (56) is\ninclined to reflect an image of a welding operation to\nthe mirror (60), which in turn is inclined to reflect the\nimage through an opening (72) in the enclosure (12) to\na third mirror (98). This mirror (98) is mounted in an\nadjoining region (100) between support members (84,\n86) which are coupled perpendicularly to each other,\nwith one member (86) coupled to the enclosure (12) by\na rotatable coupling (92). The coupling (92) allows the\nenclosure (12) and the welder (16) to be rotated about\nan axis (71) and locked in a selected position by set\nscrews (88).\nA mirror (98) reflects the welding image to a receiving\nlens (36) which is coupled via a rotatable coupling (96)\nto a vertical support member (34). The coupling (96)\nallows the enclosure (12) and the welder (16) to be\nrotated about an axis (81) and locked into a selected\nposition by a set screw (94).\nA receiving lens (36) is coupled via a fiber optic bundle\n(38) to an optical filter unit (40) where selected wavelengths of light are filtered from the welding image. The\nfilter unit (40) is in turn coupled to an enlarger (44)\nwhich enlarges the welding image and passes it to a\nThe camera (46)is connected to an eleccamera (46).\ntronic eclipser (48) which selectively darkens the\nbrightest portions of the welding image. Next, the\nimage is recorded by a video tape recorder (50) and\ndisplayed by a monitor (52).\n10 Claims, 5 Drawing Figures\n\nU S Patent\n..\n\noct 6,1987\n\nSheet 1 of 3\n\na\n\nV J\nW V\n\n4,698,484\n\nU S Patent\n..\n\noct 6,1987\n\nSheet 2 of 3\n\n4,698,484\n\nt\n\nM\n\nU S Patent\n..\n\noct 6,1987\n\nSheet 3 of 3\n\n4,698,484\n\n1\n\n4.698.484\nI\n\n,\n\n2\n\ntioned in the housing and extends through the open end\nWELDING MONITORING SYSTEM\nof the housing, the opening of the first mirror, and the\nsecond opening of the enclosure.

Cup 20 is\nsimilarly theaded onto threaded tubular portion 62 opposite opening 54 in enclosure 12. An axis 61 extends as\nshown in FIG. 3 longitudinally through housing 18, 5\nopening 54,opening 58 in mirror 56, portion 62 of enclosure 12, and opening 68 in gas cup 20. Electrode 64\nis positioned along axis 61, passing through cup 20,\nopening 58 in electrode mirror 56, and conventionally\nmounted in torch 16 with tip 66 of electrode 64 in a 10\nnormal welding relationship with opening 68 of cup 20.\nElectrode mirror 56 is held in place by mirror mount 70,\nwhich inclines mirror 56 45\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to axis 61 in\norder to reflect the image of a welding operation obtained through opening 68 in cup 20 to second mirror 15\n60.Mirror 60 is inclined 45\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to electrode\nmirror 56 (FIG. 4) and is positioned to redirect the\nreflected welding image through opening 72 of enclosure 12. Opening 72 is concentric about an axis 71,\nwhich is to one side of and perpendicular to axis 61. 20\nFitted over opening 72 of enclosure 12 is a transparent\nwindow 74, which is clamped in place by flange 76 and\nscrews 78. Flange 76 is constructed having a tubular\ncoupling member 80 in which a groove 82 is cut. Cou25\npling member 80 is part of a rotatable coupling 92, as\nwill be further described.\nA tubular outer vertical support member 84 is constructed at one end having a short horizontal support\nmember 86 which has an inside diameter slightly larger 30\nthan the outside diameter of coupling member 80, allowing horizontal support 86 to be rotatably fitted over\ncoupling member 80. Coupling member 80 and horizontal support 86 are concentric about axis 71 and allow\nrotation of enclosure 12 and welder 16 about axis 71. Set 35\nscrews 88 in threaded regions 90 of horizontal support\n86 are aligned with groove 82 in coupling member 80.\nCoupling member 80 and horizontal support 86, when\nassembled, form a rotatable coupling 92 which may be\nfixed in position by tightening set screws 88 into groove 40\n82.\nOuter vertical support 84 is similarly constructed\nhaving an inside diameter slightly larger than the outside diameter of a fixed interior vertical support 34,with\na single set screw 94 which clamps onto inner fixed 45\n4\nsupport 3 .Inner and outer vertical supports 34 and 84\nare concentrically positioned about an axis 81, which\nextends longitudinally through vertical supports 34 and\n84. Supports 34 and 84 form a rotatable coupling 96\nsimilar to coupling 92, which allows rotation of enclo- 50\nsure 12 and welder 16 about axis 81. As supports 34 and\n84 are constructed of elongated tubes having differing\ndiameters as described, they may be additionally telescoped vertically to enable adjustment in height, with\nset screw 94 locking exterior support 84 at any point 55\nvertically along fixed support tube 34.\nA third mirror 98 is adjustably mounted in an adjoining region 100 between outer vertical support member\n84 and horizontal support member 86. As shown in\nFIG. 5, mirror 98 is positioned 45\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to axes 60\n71 and 81 and is adjustably mounted by three identical\nscrews 102, which are threaded into threaded openings\n104 in mirror 98. These screws 102 are recessed as\nshown in FIG. 5 and held in place in region 100 by\nscrew retainer plates 106. Openings 108 in plates 106 65\nallow access to screws 102 for adjustably positioning\nmirror 98. Mirror 98 is inclined to reflect a welding\nimage from mirror 60 longitudinally within fixed verti-\n\n4\n\ncal support 34 to a receiving lens 36 coupled to fixed\nsupport 34.\nIn operation, welder 16 is initially adjusted to a\nproper welding orientation by loosening set screws 88\nand 94 and adjusting vertical tube 84 and enclosure 12\nuntil the desired orientation of welder 16 is achieved.\nSet screws 88 and 94 are then tightened, which locks\nwelder 16 in a welder position with respect to workpiece 14. FIG. 1 shows welder 16 welding on workpiece 14, with a section of filler wire 112 supplying filler\nmetal. An image of the welding operation taken coaxially with electrode 64 through gas cup 20 is reflected by\nelectrode mirror 56 to intermediate mirror 60, which in\nturn reflects the image along axis 71 through window 74\nand flanged tubular support 80. Window 74 serves to\nconfine the shield gas within enclosure 12 and ensures\nthat the gas passes through opening 68 in gas shield cup\n20 without leakage. After passing through window 74,\nthe welding image is reflected by adjustable mirror 98\nalong axis 81 through fixed vertical support 34 to receiving lens 36. Lens 36 focuses the image on one end\n(not shown) of fiber optic bundle 38. Bundle 38 in turn\npasses the image to a filter unit 40,which contains an\narray of optical filters from which one or more filters is\nselected and placed in the image\xe2\x80\x99s path to filter light in\nthe infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths from the image. Light in these wavelengths would otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cwash\nout\xe2\x80\x9d details from the image when displayed. The image\n4\nis then passed to an enlarger 4 , which enlarges the\nimage 16 times its normal size. Thus, if a &inch weld is\nbeing observed, it would be enlarged to about 4 inches,\nwhich provides more detail of the weld than would\notherwise be viewable. Enlarger 44 focuses the enlarged welding image on camera 46,which in turn converts the image to a video signal and passes it to electronic eclipser 48. Eclipser 48, when used, electronically \xe2\x80\x9cclips\xe2\x80\x9d any part of the video signal that exceeds an\nadjustable threshold level, which in effect darkens the\nbrightest parts of the image. This prevents the viewer\nfrom being distracted by the brightest parts of the image\nand reduces viewer eyestrain under certain welding\nconditions. At timees it becomes necessary to see the\narea around the welding arc, in which case eclipser 48 is\nnot used. In either case, eclipser 48 then transmits the\nimage to a video tape player 50 where the image is\nrecorded. Video tape recorder 50 also passes the image\nto a monitor 52 where it is displayed for viewing as the\nwelding operation proceeds.\nFrom the foregoing, it is apparent that the applicants\nhave provided a welding monitoring system which\nallows welder 16 to be readily positioned while leaving\nlens 36 and fiber optic bundle 38 undisturbed. This is\ndone by utilizing a rotatable coupling 92 which allows\nwelder 16 and enclosure 12 to be rotated in a vertical\nplane about axis 71 and a second, telescoping, rotatable\ncoupling 96 which allows welder 16 to be adjusted in\nheight as well as allowing rotation in a horizontal plane\nabout axis 81.\nWe claim:\n1.
