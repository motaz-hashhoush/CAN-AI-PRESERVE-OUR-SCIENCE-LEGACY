It is a materials balance model which calculates daily increments of photosynthate production and respiratory losses in the crop canopy. The partitioning of the resulting dry matter to the active growing tissues in the plant each day, transpiration and the uptake of nitrogen from the soil profile are simulated. It incorporates the RHIZOS model which simulates, in two dimensions, the movement of water, roots, and soluble nutrients through the soil profile. It records the time of initiation of each of the plant organs. These phenological events are calculated from temperature functions with delays resulting from physiological stress. Stress is defined mathematically as an imbalance in the metabolite supply; demand ratio. Physiological stress is also the basis for the calculation of rates of tiller and floret abortion. Thus, tillering and head differentiation are modeled as the resulants of the two processes, morphogenesis and abortion, which may be occurring simulaneously.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820024913, "id": "1ba2753348e64bd4878e684e9ec028d8", "publicationDate": "1981-08-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19820024913.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19820024913/downloads/19820024913.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19820024913/downloads/19820024913.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19820024913/downloads/19820024913.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
