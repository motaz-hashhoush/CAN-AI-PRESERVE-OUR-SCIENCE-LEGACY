The advantages of titanium over other metals are shown to apply to future subsonic aircraft as well as for supersonic designs. The cost problem of titanium is addressed and shown to be markedly reduced by the emerging technologies of superplastic forming/diffusion bonding sandwich, hot isostatic pressing of titanium powders, and isothermal forgings if demonstration programs should validate preliminary findings. The impact of a U.S. AST program on the United States titanium supply and demand picture is postulated.", "title": "Effects of an AST program on US titanium story", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T07:10:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810009489, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fitzsimmons, R.
