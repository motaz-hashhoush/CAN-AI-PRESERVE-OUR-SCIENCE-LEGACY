Because SNAP-19 was not the primary power supply and the Nimbus\nB experiments were relatively insensitive to its presence, several\npotential interface problems of future applications were not encountered. Nevertheless, the experience should aid future endeavo r s of this type.\nThe NASA specification requirements are reviewed and the\nproblems attendant to their implementation are explored. In this\nprogram, aerospace nuclear safety considerations were found to\nimpose the greatest restrictions both on design and integration.\nThe importance of complete user specifications and nuclear safety\nevaluations early in the program is emphasized.\n\nV\n\nSNAP-19/MMBUS B INTEGRATION EXPERIENCE\n\nINTRODUCTION\nOn May 18, 1968 the SNAP-19 Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)\nsystem was launched aboard NASA\'s Nimbus B spacecraft. This event marked\nthe culmination of almost five years of intensive effort by NASA, AEC, and their\nrespective contractors. Unfortunately, a malfunction of the launch vehicle\'s Thorad\nstage resulted in its destruction by the Range Safety Officer approximately two\nminutes after liftoff. The system impacted in the coastal waters off Vandenberg\nA i r Force Base and thus the ultimate mission goals were not immediately\nrealized. Nevertheless, the SNAP-1 9/Nimbus \xe2\x82\xac3 Program represented a series\nof very significant first-time events, includingthe following:\nSNAP-19 was to be the first isotope power system to be flown on a\nNASA spacecraft.\nThe SNAP-19/Nimbus B Program represented the first real attempt\nto develop an integrated isotope space power system with compatibility\nof all interfaces.\nThis was the first RTG application where the use specified a complete\nset of requirements and had an opportunity to play an active role which\ninfluenced the system development and program conduct.\n\na1 RTG system to implement an\n\nSNAP-19 was to be the first\'\nphilosophy. It\nany system flown to date.\n\nad the largest isotope inventory of\n\nThe integration of an RTG with an un\nf t presents unique, and\noften difficult design situations. These\no some extent, by a\nlack of experience and a retrofit approach. A l l\ncations to date have\nsting systems. The presbeen as substitutes, or auxiliary power\nent application is no exception. Althoug\ns had a significant\neffect on the final product, the fact is t\noriginally designed to be used together. Thus, some performance\nunavoidable in the retrofit process. 0\nencountered under this program were not as difficult as th\nexpected on potential NASA missions,\nthe RTG will be the sole power source, the missio\nlonger, and the spacecraft will contain\nmore sensitive to the presence of the RTGs than was the case with Nimbus B.\n1\n\nNotwithstanding the aborted launch and the fact that problems were encountered\non the SNAP-19/Nimbus B Program, a good deal of valuable experience was\ngained on how to prevent and/or solve such problems on future applications. This\npaper examines some of the more significant user requirements and integration\nproblems in light of their effects on the program. It will be seen that an RTG\npower system cannot be treated in the same manner as other spacecraft systems,\nthat nuclear safety requirements have an over-riding influence on both system\ndesign and integration, and that the numerous RTG-spacecraft interface constraints\nmust be considered in the earliest phases of mission planning.\n\nSNAP-19 OBJECTIVES\nFigure 1 shows the SNAP-19/Nimbus B system. SNAP-19 served the dual\nrole of experiment and auxiliary power supply. The mission objectives, with\nrespect to SNAP-19 use, were as follows:\n\nFigure l-SNAP-l9/Nimbus\n\n2\n\nB\n\nArrangement\n\n(1) To demonstrate experimentally the feasibility of integrating an RTG\n\nsystem with a complex NASA unmanned observatory type spacecraft.\n(2) To assess the performance and operational compatibility of RTG power\nsupplies in long-life operational environments,\n(3) To obtain maximum power availability from SNAP-19 and utilize this\n\npower to supplement the prime solar power system.\n\nThe feasibility of generating power from RTGs had been demonstrated\npreviously but the complex interfaces had not been encountered prior to this\napplication. From a power requirement viewpoint, the basic Nimbus B objectives\nwere attainable without SNAP-19. The major advantage of the auxiliary power\nsupply was that it could provide an additional margin for success by permitting\nthe storage batteries to operate at a lower depth of discharge during satellite\nnight, allowing more experiments to operate simultaneously for longer periods,\nand helping to provide in excess of minimum spacecraft power in the event of a\npartial solar power system failure such as occurred in the first Nimbus mission.\nFigure 2 shows the estimated Nimbus B regulated bus power versus time in\norbit. The solar power degradation is based upon the actual experience of Nimbus 2. The RTG contribution is assumed to be about 52 watts at launch and 40\nwatts at the end of one year. The significant point illustrated by this figure is\nthat with solar power alone, some programming of experiments would be necessary beyond three months. If the RTG performed as anticipated, it would negate\nthis requirement, provide significant experiment programming flexibility, and\nperhaps even prolong the mission lifetime.\n\nNIMBUS B SYSTEM AND MJSSION1\nThe Nimbus Program is oriented toward the development of long range\nnumerical weather prediction and earth resources studies. The program is also\nproviding advanced sensor development capability of a unique kind for the ultimate\nuse of meteorologists , atmospheric physicists, the operational meteorological\nsatellites, and for the discovery, development, and conservation of world resources. Nimbus B was the third in the series of spacecraft under this program.\nIts specific objective was to apply satellite techniques to derive quantitative\nmeasurements of atmospheric structure relevant to numerical forecasting techniques. This was to be achieved by:\n\n3\n\nSOLAR 8 RTG\nFULL, SPACECRAFT REQUIREMENT\n\nMINIMUM SPACECRAFT REQUIREM\xe2\x80\x99ENT\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\nTI ME (MONTHS)\n\nFigure 2-Nimbus\n\nB\n\nPower\n\nVs.

The\nbasic structure consists of three major elements: a hexagon-shaped attitude\ncontrol housing, a toroidal sensory ring, and the solar paddle subsystem. Each\nelement is mechanicdly and thermally independent, with the exception of structural interfaces. Magnesium is the primary structural material and the entire\nsystem weighs about 1250 pounds.\n\nZ\n0\n0\n\n5\n\nThe attitude control housing contains the hardware required for spacecraft\n3-axis earth orientation and provides a mounting platform for the sun sensors,\nhorizon scanners, command antenna, and solar paddle driveshaft.\nThe sensory ring is attached to the control housing by a truss structure. It\nis a hollow circular torus section composed of 18 rectangular compartments or\nbays. The spacecraft experiments are mounted in these bays, o r from crossbeam structures on the ring.\nThe spacecraft derives continuous regulated power at -24.5 volts dc from a\nsolar conversion power supply connected in parallel with the SNAP-19 power\nsupply system. The two rectangular solar-oriented paddles provide solar-toelectrical power conversion. In addition, eight nickel-cadmium storage batteries,\nrecharged by the solar array during satellite day, provide power for the experiments and spacecraft subsystems during satellite night.\nTemperature control of the sensory ring and control housing is achieved by\na passive/active combination of insulation and mechanical techniques. A thermostated active system of controlled louvers, plus multiple layers of aluminized\nmylar insulation, provide control to the individual bays to maintain a mean subsystem ring temperature of 77*10\xc2\xb0F. Proper solar paddle temperatures are\nmaintained through a passive arrangement of reflection filters and high emittance\nsurfaces.\nNimbus B was to be launched from the Western Test Range (WTR) into a\ncircular near-polar orbit of 600 nautical mile altitude. The launch vehicle was\na Thorad-Agena D. The spacecraft was to orbit the earth about 13 times each\nday and its design lifetime was one year.\n\nSNAP-19 SYSTEM2\nThe SNAP-19 power supply system was developed by the AEC. Figure 4\nshows its configuration for the Nimbus B application. The flight design evolved\nthrough several iterations, most of which involved the heat source and generator\ninternals. Externally, the generators themselves bear a strong resemblance to\ntheir predecessor, SNAP-SA.\n,\\\xe2\x80\x99\n\nBasically, the system consists of two generators mounted in tandem at an\nangle of 16O outboard from the vertical, a power conditioning unit (PCU) and a ,\ntelemetry signal conditioning unit (TSCU). Each generator was fueled with about\n570 thermal watts of plutonium-238 dioxide microspheres contained in a single\nfuel capsule and delivered about 28 electrical watts at 2.6 volts dc to the PCU\n\n6\n\nLIFTING STUD (4 PLACES)\n\nUPPER GENERATOR\n\nLOWER GENERATOR\nVIER AT IONSPACECRAFT\nSENSORY RING\n\nUPPORT BASE\nTANDOFF\n\'OWER CONDITIONER\n\nTELEMETRY\nCONDl T I ON E R\nFigure 4-SNAP-19 Arrangement\n\n7\n\nat the time of launch. The power conditioner correspondingly supplied about\n50 watts (e) at -24.5 volts dc to the spacecraft regulated bus. The TSCU receives\nanalog signals from diagnostic sensors in the generators and PCU\'s, conditions\nthese signals, and supplies them to the spacecraft analog-to-digital converter.\nThe TSCU also furnishes digital signals that indicate whether the system is on\no r off the regulated bus. Both the PCU and TSCU are housed in standard Nimbus\nmodules and located in the sensory ring bay immediately below the generators.\nThe generators are mounted bn a support structure which consists of a\nsupport base and a standoff. The standoff is a triangular aluminum alloy structural\nadapter that attaches the generator subsystem to the sensory ring. Bolted atop\nthe standoff is the stainless steel support base to which a stainless steel, spoked,\nvibration-isolating spring assembly is bolted. The generator subsystem is bolted\nto this spring assembly.\nThe bracket containing the two electrical receptacles is used to connect the\ngenerators to a dummy load or to place them on short circuit. It was removed\nprior to flight. The three permanent electrical connectors on the standoff connect\nall wiring between the generators and the spacecraft. This wiring includes generator power leads as well as leads to the TSCU.\nThe pertinent characteristics of the SNAP-19 system are summarized in\nTable 1.\nThe electrical arrangement of the system is shown in Figure 5. Each of the\ngenerators is in series with a corresponding dc-to-dc converter in the PCU while\nthe generator-converter combinations are electrically in parallel with each other.\nThus, a gross failure of either generator or converter would still permit the\nsystem to operate at half power. The TSCU provides 28 signals to the spacecraft\ntelemetry system. Twenty-six of these are analog signals related to system\nperformance while two are digital and indicate whether the converters are on\no r off the spacecraft regulated bus. The latter condition is effected by relays,\nin series with the P C U outputs, which are controlled by ground commands through\nthe spacecraft. A total of four commands is available to place either, o r both,\nof the converters on the regulated bus or on a fixed auxiliary load.\n\nUSER REQUIREMENTS\nA s soon as the planned use of SNAP-19 on Nimbus B became official, NASA\nrecognized the immediate need for a detailed set of user requirements. These\ntook the form of a technical interface specification, a program s p e ~ i f i c a t i o n , ~\nand a program schedule, and represented the first time that an RTG user had\npresented such requirements to the supplier.\n8\n\nh\nQ\nW\n\na,\n\nd\n.\n4\n\n3%\nrnk\n\n3 2\no a\na m\n\na\n0\n\nc-\n\nm\nm\nI1\nY\n\n0\n0\nL\n\nC\n.L(\n\nLI\n\nE\ns3\n?\n-\n\nm\nm\n\nI\n\ni\n1\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nn\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\na\n,\n\nE\n:\n\nk\n\n.rl\n\n0\n\n0\n\nc\n,\n\ncd\n4\n5\n\ncn\n\na\n\nc\n,\n\nEd\n\nH\n\na,\n\nx\n\nbn\n\nE\n:\nm\n5\n\n.4\n\n2\n\nLJ\n\nu\n\nPI\ne\n\ne\n\n,--\n\n9\n\n28\nCHANNELS\n\nFigure 5-SNAP-19 System Electrical Schematic\n\nThe technical interface document was effectively a product or functional\ntype of specification which spelled out interface and performance requirements\nand provided a basis for system acceptance. The program specification covered\nitems t o be delivered, services to be provided, and studies and tests to be performed by the supplier in order to satisfy the Nimbus B program requirements.\nFinally, the schedule established delivery dates which would assure compatibility\nwith the Nimbus B milestones.\nRealistically, NASA could not overlook the fact that detailed designs, and\neven some hardware, were already in existence both for SNAP-19 and Nimbus B.\nThus, some degree of retrofit was inevitable. With the underlying flexibility of\nbeing able to remove SNAP-19 from the program at any reasonable time prior to\nlaunch with only a small effect on mission success, the NASA requirements had\nthe following objectives :\n(1) SNAP-19 was to be completely compatible with the Nimbus B spacecraft\n\nand mission goals.\n(2) SNAP-19 was to be suitably isolated from other spacecraft systems such\n\nthat any credible failure mode would not endanger mission success.\n(3)\n\nModifications to existing hardware designs would be minimized.\n\n(4) Fully qualified SNAP-19 hardware would be available in a timely manner\nto support the spacecraft development and test program.\n10\n\nA lack of prior experience in such endeavors, together with interagency\nnegotiations, prompted several modifications to the specifications before final\nagreement was reached by all cognizant parties. The approved requirements\nprovided a uniform set of ground rules to which everyone could work.\nThe major areas of specification requirements and their ramifications are\ngiven in Table 2. It must be emphasized that the effects of each interface area\nare, in some cases, peculiar to SNAP-19, Nimbus B, and the philosophy of this\napplication. Interface requirements which posed little problem to this mission\ncould well be over-riding on,subsequent missions. The converse is also true.\nTable 3 lists the major hardware items which were required to support this\nprogram. It is probably typical of the requirements for similar applications.\nTable 2\nSNAP-19/Nimbus B Interface Considerations\nInterface Area\n\nConsideration\n\nEffect On Hardware\nand Program\n\nLaunch approval; safety i s u s e r\nresponsibility\n\nMajor\n\nPhysic al/Me c hani c a1\n\nSatisfy established envelopes; survive\nlaunch environment\n\nSignificant\n\nThermal\n\nMaintain spacecraft thermal balance\n\nMinor\n\nElectrical\n\nSpacecraft power system compatibility\n\nMinor\n\nNuclear Radiation\n\nPersonnel access; degradation of spacecraft components\n\nMinor\n\nMagnetic Field\n\nAffects attitude control system\n\nSignificant\n\nDiagnostic Instrument ation Support SNAP- 19 experiment\n\nSignificant\n\nDevelopment and\nVerification Testing\n\nMajor\n\nSPECIFIC\n\nINTEGRATION\n\nVerify performance and compatibility\n\nPROBLEMS\n\nIn retrospect, it appears that some of the interface problems might have\nbeen avoided had they been more thoroughly investigated before the designs were\nfixed. However, one of the anticipated benefits of this program was to gain\nexperience in integrating RTGs with a NASA spacecraft. Nimbus B, being relatively insensitive to the presence of the RTGs and not being totally dependent\non their power, provided an excellent test bed. It is of interest to examine some\nspecific problems encountered in the various interface areas and review the\napproaches to their solution.\n\n1\n1\n\nTable 3\nSNAP-19 Hardware for Support of Nimbus B Program\nSNAP-19 Systems\nMechanical Model\nNo. 2\n\nEngineering Model\n\nNo. 3\n\nEndurance Test\n\nNo. 4\n\nFueled Prototype\n\nNo. 5\n\nElectrical Prototype\n\nNo. 6\n\nFueled Flight Backup\n(Dispersal Mode)\n\nNo. 7\n\nFueled Flight Prime (Dispersal\nMode)\n\nNo. 6A\n\nFueled Prototype (Intact Mode)\n\nNo. 8\n\nFueled Flight (Intact Mode)actual flight hardware\nMajor Ground Support Equipment\nGround Support Test Console (GSTC)\n\nHeat Source Shipping Container\nGenerator Subsystem Shipping Container\nMobile Carriage with Power Supply\nPortable Monitor Package\nNuclear Safety\nIt is shortsighted to consider nuclear safety merely as an interface. Rather,\nit forms the basic criteria for the system design and mission and, indeed, controls many of the other interfaces. More costs, program delays, and performance\npenalties can be attributed to nuclear safety than to any other single factor. The\nsignificance of this can be seen with respect to several major SNAP-19 heat\nsource design changes, all of which can be attributed to nuclear safety.\nThe original SNAP-19 heat source consisted of multiple capsules of a relatively low melting point plutonium fuel in a segmented heat accumulator block.\n\n12\n\nBoth the capsules and the fuel were designed for high altitude burnup to a fine\nhad been applied to\n\ncapsule in a modified segme\n\nstudies revealed uncertainties w i\n\nect to microsp\n\nphilosophy change rather late in the program, This final concept evolved into the\nactual flight hardware during 1967 and consisted of a helium vented heat source\nencased within a permanent reentry heat shield. It is known as the SNAP-19\nIntact Reentry Heat Source (IRHS) and is differentiated from earlier SNAP-19\nheat sources in that it prevent6 fuel release prior to post-reentry impact.\nNuclear safety considerations also necessitated provision for the potential\ninclusion of an RTG ejection mechanism early in the program while high altitude\nheat source and fuel burnup were required. It was felt that ejecting the system\nby command in the event of an ascent abort or prior to orbital reentry would\nesirable thermal shielding effects of the spacecraft and assure\n,\nnup. While the need for the eject mechanism disappeared in\n1966, its effects on integration and performance were permanent. The complex\nand weighty support base was needed to mount the system cantilevered at a 16O\nangle from the vertical as is seen in Figure 4. This, in turn, caused mechanical\ninterference between the generator fins, the shroud, and the spacecraft control\nhousing. The interference was eliminated by removing portions of the fins. This\nwas accompanied by a reduction in the generator\'s thermal inventory in order to\nmaintain design temperatures. The ultimate consequence was a reduction in\npower output.\nLaunch vehicle destruct criteria re carefully evaluated, with the aim of\nprecluding conditions which led to the abort of a SNAP-SA launched aboard a\nThor Ablestar from the WTR in 1964. Although a non-nominal Thor trajectory\nwas evident during that launch, there were no applicable criteria f\nion. The second stage was allowed to burn to propellant d\n1\n\n13\n\nwhich resulted in a ballistic reentry. In order to provide an answer to questions\nwhich arose because of this anomalous flight, NASA performed a study to determine the feasibility of defining an envelope of Thorad performance parameters,\nusing standard range data displays, outside of which a nominal Agena could not\nachieve an orbit with perigee greater than 90 nautical miles. This would hopefully\nprovide a set of "no orbit" conditions which would constitute a potential criterion\nfor the WTR Range Safety Officer to terminate the mission prior to Thorad\nseparation and loss of all vehicle destruct capability. Impact would be in deep\nocean, thus precluding any hazard. The study concluded that the approach was\nnot feasible. During the flight period in which destruct capability exists, there\nis no way of uniquely establishing with certainty whether the payload will achieve\norbit. Further, this approach would lessen the probability of Nimbus B mission\nsuccess, while still not attaining the original goal.\nTermination of the Nimbus B flight had no direct connection with the \'\'no orbit"\ncriterion investigation. The trajectory exceeded the previously defined range\nsafety impact limit line within the first two minutes of flight and the course of\naction was virtually automatic, The mission would have been terminated in exactly\nthe same time and manner even if SNAP-19 had not been aboard.\nThe series of interagency procedures known as ?*launch\napproval" forms the\nmotivation for all nuclear safety efforts and interfaces. Thus, every safety related study and test performed under the development and integration program\nhad as its objective the demonstration of mission safety to an extent sufficient to\nobtain launch approval. The Nimbus B/SNAP-19 safety program was more extensive than those of earlier SNAP programs. This was, in large part, due to potential interactions between the spacecraft and RTG systems. However, because the\nsafety investigation was so thorough, it was possible to predict confidently that\nno hazard existed as a result of the abort.\nTable 4 summarizes the major safety test areas under the SNAP-19/Nimbus\nB Program.\n\nPhysical/Mechanical\nSeveral interface problems of a physical/mechanical type arose and most\ncan be attributed, directly o r indirectly, to the ejection requirement. Several\npossible SNAP-19 mounting locations were investigated including atop and below\nthe control housing and sensory ring periphery. Considerations of experiment\ninterference, reliability, physical envelope maintenance, minimum spacecraft\nstructural perturbations, and the potential ejection requirement led to the selected\nmounting configuration. This callled for the RTGs to be mounted in tandem above\n\n14\n\nTable 4\nSummary of SNAP-19/Nimbus B Safety Test Program\nPurpose\n\nTest\nA.

The immediate effects on the spacecraft required a rearrangement of\nexperiment modules to achieve a mass balance in the sensory ring. Increased\nloads on the sensory ring structure were accomodated by strengthening the outboard and radial shear webs, installing inboard shear webs, and strengthening\nthe upper and lower inboard rings. It was also necessary to provide bolt holes\nfor the SNAP-19 standoff structure.\nTwo cases of serious physical interference between the RTG fins and spacecraft o r launch vehicle were discovered during the integration program. The\nfirst of these involved the two outboard fins on the upper generator which were\nfound to extend beyond the shraud exclusion envelope. defined by the specification,\nunder both static and dynamic conditions. This problem was noted analytically\nand verified when one of the early SNAP-19 systems was mounted on a spacecraft\nmodel. It was remedied by shaving the corners of these two fins to remove the\ninterference.\nThe second case of fin interference involved the two inboard fins on each\ngenerator. Since the reentry attitude of Nimbus B is arbitrary, a large number\nof reentry orientations is possible. Analysis revealed that these fins would impact the control housing, o r its supporting struts, as a consequence of ejection in\nnearly every credible reentry mode. Removal of two inches from the length of\neach of the four inboard fins was necessary to solve the problem, at least in\nthose instances wherein the spacecraft was not tumbling at the time of ejection.\nThe final fin configuration is shown in Figure 6 . The combined radiator\narea removed from the inboard and outboard fins caused increased internal\ntemperatures which were undesirable. It was necessary to reduce the input\npower per RTG from 625 watts to 570 watts to restore the design temperature\nconditions This reduced the system\'s electri\nwatts. Although the potential ejection require\non the SNAP-19 system were pr\nA significant mechanical type problem was noted in connection with vibration\ntesting of the fueled prototype SNAP-19 when the heat accumulator block and\nthermal insulation were damaged. Post-test examination revealed that the damage\nwas caused by movement of the fuel capsule in the upper generator during vibraugh this effect had not been seen in flight acceptance level testing\n(prototype levels are more severe than flight acceptance levels), the fuel capsule\nload plate was redesigned and the insulation preload increased to preclude future\nproblems of this nature.\n-\n\n16\n\nc\n\nFigure 6-SNAP-19 Final Fin Configuration\n\n17\n\nThermal interface problems required investigation because of the imposition\nof a fairly large thermal source (about 1100 watts) into a system which had been\ndesigned previously for a high degree of thermal control. The NASA specification\nwas concerned with conduction from the RTGs to the sensory ring through the\nsupport structure, from the PCU and TSCU modules to the sensory ring, radiation\nfrom the RTGs to spacecraft subsystems, and transportation and launch pad\ncooling requirements.\nThe specification permitted a maximum flow of 12 watts from the RTGs\nto the sensory ring. This required careful design of the support structure to\nminimize thermal paths. Measurements showed the actual value to be about 13\nwatts, which was greater than specified but still acceptable. The allowable total\nconduction from the P C U and TSCU modules into the sensoryring was 14 watts.\nOnce again, tests showed that this requirement was satisfied. However, in order\nt o accommodate even these allowable thermal loads, it was necessary to remove\nthe thermal insulation from beneath bays 1 and 18. Thermal radiation levels\nfrom the RTGs to sensitive spacecraft subsystems were found to present no undue\nperturbations to their performance.\nNimbus philosophy normally requires complete assembly and test of the\nflight spacecraft and adapter, transport to WTR, mating to the launch vehicle,\nand launch without altering the spacecraft configuration. An exception was necessary in the case of SNAP-19, as analysis indicated the posibility of seriously\ndamaging the solar ,paddles if the transport aircraft air conditioning system\nfailed on route\'to WTR. It was not possible to provide redundant air conditioning.\nPrimarily for this reason, it was decided to transport the SNAP-19 separately\nfrom Nimbus B.\nTests were necessary to determine whether additional launch pad air conditioning capability would be required to accomodate the SNAP-19 thermal source\nduring prelaunch enshrouded conditions. The standard pad equipment was capable\nof providingabout 45 lb/min of 60\xc2\xb0F air to the launch vehicle shroud. The tests\nwere parametric in air flow rate and temperature and utilized an electrically\nheated SNAP-19 system, an electrical systems model spacecraft, and an actual\nshroud. The existing cooling capabilities were found to be adequate. Additionally,\nin the event of an air conditioning failure, both Nimbus B and SNAP-19 heatup\nrates are sufficiently slow to permit the activation of backup equipment.\n\n18\n\nNuclear Radiation\nBecause of the relatively low radiation dose rates associated with the original\nfuel form, little consideration was given to the nuclear radiation interface during\nthe early program phases. However, the change to the oxide form with its multifold increase in neutron emission rate caused this interface to take on added\nsignificance. There are two discrete aspects of this problem; biological hazards\nassociated with personnel exposure and radiation effects on sensitive spacecraft\ncomponents which could affect mission goals. The biological hazard aspect was\nsolved by providing a shielded shipping container for the RTG subsystem which\nsatisfied all AEC and Department of Transportation (DOT) shipping regulations. ,\nThis large, heavy cask complicated handling to some extent but posed no insurmountable problems. SNAP-19 launch site handling and installation had to be\nvery carefully planned to minimize personnel exposures but all operations were\ncarried out with exceeding the allowable 3 rem/calendar quarter dose for radi\'\nation workers. Figure 7 shows the actual radiation isodose curves surrounding\nthe spacecraft mounted SNAP-19 and the corresponding permissible whole body\nexposure times.\nPotential radiation effects on spacecraft components were of a more serious\nnature since it is unlikely that any shielding weight o r volume could have been\ntolerated at that point in the program when the fuel form was changed. A study\nwas performed6 t o assess the effects of the combined space and RTG radiation\non sensitive spacecraft components. These included diodes , transistors , resistors,\ncapacitors, and solar cells as well as certain spacecraft grease and seal materials. Special emphasis was given to metal oxide semiconductor field effect\ntransistor (MOSFE T) devices. The natural and artifical radiation belts existing\nin the planned Nimbus B orbit consist of protons and electrons with energies of\nup to 30 and 6 MeV, respectively. It was found, on a radiation damage basis, that\nthe contribution of SNAP-19 was quite small compared to that of the orbital environment. Furthermore, the results indicated that no significant degradation of\nany component o r interference with any experiment would occur during the one\nyear mission plus six months of prelaunch exposure. This conclusion has been\nverified by Nimbus 2, which has far exceeded its design life in a similar orbital\nenvironment.\nAlthough nuclear radiation interfaces presented no severe integration problems\non this program, it is worth noting that this is likely to be one of the most restrictive interfaces in future NASA applications , particularly long duration deep\nspace probes. RTG powered spacecraft containing sensitive radiation detectors\nare being considered for deep space missions of 5 to 10 years duration. Aside\nfrom the obvious long term degradation effects on electronics, the allowable total\nincident RTG particle flux at the detectors is likely to be limited to a maximum\n\n19\n\n8 9 h r 34\n\nmrem\nhr\n\n-\n\nNOTE.

This is several orders of magnitude less than unshielded RTG Background.\nThus, very sophisticated tradeoff studies between distance and shield weight will\nbe required.\n\nDiagnostic Instrumentation\nThe original SNAP-19 system contained minimal diagnostic sensors. Since\none of the major functions of SNAP-19 on Nimbus B was as an experiment, the\nNASA specification required additional instrumentation for purposes of assessing orbital performance as well as development and qualification ground test\nperformance. The type and number of sensors were effectively similar in both\nthe ground test and flight units and are shown in Table 5.\nTable 5\nSNAP-19 Telemetry\nMeasurement\n\nNumber\n\nRTG hot junction temperature\n\n3 per RTG\n\nRTG fin root temperature\n\n3 per RTG\n\nRTG internal gas pressure\n\n1 per RTG\n\nRTG output voltage\n\n1 per RTG\n\nP C U input voltage\n\n1 per P C U\n\nP C U input current\n\n1 per P C U\n\nP C U output voltage\n\n1 per P C U\n\nP C U output current\n\n1 per P C U\n\nP C U temperature\n\n1 per P C U\n\nPCU on o r off regulated bus\n\n1 per PCU\n\nThe immediate effect of the instrumentation requirement was the addition\nof two major hardware compo\no the SNAP-19 program; the TSCU and the\ned previously. It is a flight hardware comGSTC. The TSCU has been di\nponent whose primary purpose is to condition the signals from the various sensors in the RTGs and P C U s to a range of 0 to -6.4 volts, which is the range\npatible with the spacecraft analog-to-digital converter in the PC M telemetry\nsystem. The TSCU power requirement, which is slightly under two watts, is\nfurnished by the spacecraft regulated bus.\n\n21\n\nThe GSTC, shown in Figure 8, was used for ground testing only and thus\ndid not present any integration problems, as such. It is important to note, however, that it represents a complex and costly piece of equipment which was required by NASA to support the integration program. Its basic functions were:\n(1) To provide a common set of equipment for complete functional testing\nof all SNAP-19 hardware, individually or as a system.\n( 2 ) To simulate the RTGs, TSCU, o r PCU for system checkout,\n(3) To calibrate the TSCU.\n\n(4) To supply power for electrically heated RTGs.\n\nFigure 8-SNAP-19 Ground Support T e s t Control\n\n22\n\n(5) To continuously monitor and print 40 channels of test data and visually\ndisplay any 8 of these on Brush charts.\n\nElectrical\n*-\n\nThis was one of the most inportant functional interfaces inasmuch as SNAP-19\nis an electrical power supply and full compatibility with the spacecraft electrical\nsystems was mandatory. Additionally, because of the philosophy of SNAP-19 use\non Nimbus Bythe electrical interface had to be such that any failure or nonnominal performance of SNAP-19 would have no adverse effect on the spacecraft\nsystems.\nThe NASA specification required that the SNAP-19 be isolated from the\nbus by means of diodes and fuses. Isolation diodes were furnished in the P C U\nwhile fuses were provided by the spacecraft. It was also found necessary to provide a protective circuit in the P C U which insured against a PCU open circuit\ncondition. The resulting high voltages, above 30 volts dc, could damage the P C U\nand possibly the spacecraft. The protective circuit detects a converter open\ncircuit condition and automatically places a simulated short circuit on the RTG\noutput. When the converter load returns, the protective circuit becomes inoperative\nand normal system operation is resumed.\nDuring the course of the program, an electrical incompatibility problem\ninvolving excessive RFI noise from the TSCU arose. The NASA specification\nallowance for RFI noise from the total SNAP-19 system, reflected as noise on\nthe spacecraft regulated bus, was 50 millivolts peak-to-peak with no specffic\nfrequency restriction. During spacecraft integration testing, the integration contractor detected a 400 cycle, 1volt peak-to-peak ripple spike from the TSCU.\nThis condition was intolerable because it exceeded the threshold for destruction\nof P C M telemetry gates on the same lines as the TSCU and interfered with\nSNAP-19 telemetry data. The problem was not easily solved. Several modifications involving additional filters, component replacement, and rewiring of boards\nwere necessary before the noise was reduced to an acceptable level.\nMametic\n\nMagnetic measurements on a fueled SNAP-19 dispersal design system were\nmade at GSFC in November 1967. The initial perm was 2725 dyne-cm/oersted,\nat 12 feet. After exposure to a 15gauss on-off dcpulse, it rose to 3131 dyne-cm/\noersted, which corresponds to a torque of about 600 dyne-cm in a 600 nautical\nmile orbit. An early version of the NASA specification limited this torque to 50\ndyne-cm because of spacecraft control gas usage but this limitation was later\n23\n\nremoved. It was found that this system could be depermed to 415 dyne-cm/oersted\nby a 50 gauss ac hysterisis field for several minutes.\n\nIn April 1968, the SNAP-19 flight model was magnetically measured at GSFC.\nThis as-received moments were 4600 and 3890 dyne-cm/oersted with the RTGs\nshorted and on dummy load, respectively. Again, deperming was possible, this\n.\ntime to 870 dyne-cm/oersted.\nThe postulated reason for the unexpectedly high as-received magnetization\nis the high fields associated with the vibration facility used to qualify the hardware. This postulation is borne out by measurements made at the General Elect r i c Company after the return trip from GSFC using portable magnetometer apparatus and deperm coils. The perm state had not change measurably. A magnetic survey was performed again at the launch site and although provisions were\navailable to deperm the system, this was not necessary since no change had\noccurred during transport and handling.\nNo problem was anticipated assuming that the system would not be significantly remagnetized as a result of actual launch vibrations. Calculations showed\nthat even under worst case conditions, the control gas would be adequate for a\ntwo year mission.\nThis experience confirmed that RTGs can be highly magnetic devices but\nthat steps can be taken to lessen the problem.\nWhile the magnetic interface problem on Nimbus B affected only control gas\nusage, there are planned missions where the effects of magnetic field on experiment feasibility will be far more critical. Future space probes, for which RTGs\nare likely to represent the only practical power source, will attempt to measure\nplanetary and interstellar magnetic fields. Such probes cannot tolerate magnetic\nfields in excess of lom6 gauss emanating from the spacecraft due to residual\nmagnetism o r circulatingcurrents. This can be compared with the measured\ngauss at 12 feet from the SNAP-19 system. It is apparent then that magnetic\ncharacteristics will be an important consideration in both the design and integration of future spacecraft.\n\nSvstem Verification Testing\nThe NASA specification required extensive performance and environmental\ntesting to verify that the SNAP-19 system would function as desired under the\nanticipated mission environments and that the interface compatibility requirements were satisfied. The basic test sequence is illustrated in Figure 9, which\n\n24\n\n*\n\nPAR A METR I C\n\nVACUUM TEST\n\nI\n\nLEGEND\nG GENERATOR\nPC POWER CONDITIONER\nTM TELEMETRY CONDITIONER\nGS GENERATOR SUBSYSTEM\nPS POWER SUPPLY\n\nFigure\n\n1\nI\n\nACCEPTANCE\nTE,!jT\n\nINTEGRATED\nNIMBUS B /\nSNAP-I9 TEST\n\n9-SNAP-1 9 Testing Program Sequence\n\n25\n\nI\n\ndoes not include any of the component development or safety testing. The environmental tests consisted of humidity, vibration, acceleration, and thermal/\nvacuum for prototype systems with only vibration and thermal/vacuum tests\nrequired for the flight system. In conformance with NASA philosophy, the prototype vibration levels were about 50 percent more severe than flight levels.\nSuch testing is time consuming and must be carefully planned to avoid\nschedule delays. Under the Nimbus B/SNAP-19 Program, schedule delays precluded complete testing of some of the early models prior to delivery. Thus the\ndiscovery of several problems , which these tests were designed to detect, was\ndelayed until later in the program when the consequences were more costly. A\nsignificant amount of re-testing was also necessitated by the several design\nchanges which occurred during the development program.\nThe use of SNAP-19 on Nimbus B necessitated a deviation from standard\nNASA testing philosophy. Normally, final acceptance testing of the flight spacecraft is performed with all the flight subsystems. Once testing is complete the\nconfiguration is not disturbed. Because of the handling difficulties with fueled\ngenerators and the potential hazards associated with environmental testing,\nhowever small, a decision was made to use the electrically heated SNAP-19\nprototype for final flight spacecraft acceptance testing. In addition, it was found\nmore expedient to transport the fueled SNAP-19 separately from the spacecraft\nand mate the two at the launch site on R-2 day, just prior to shroud installation.\nNeither of these operations caused any real problems but they do emphasize\nthe fact that RTGs cannot always be treated the same as other spacecraft subsystems and that the user might have to deviate occasionally from standard procedures to accomodate the unique characteristics of nuclear power supplies.\n\nC ONC LUSIONS\n\nThe Nimbus B/SNAP-19 integration experience was, in many ways, unique\nto this mission and to the philosophy of the SNAP-19 application. All of the\nlems which arose were resolved satisfactorily within the program constraints,\nalthough perhaps not always in an optimum manner, Nevertheless, one of the\nprogram objectives was to gain integration experience.\nis experience will\nation with respect\ne for future program planning and imple\nprovide,\nto those\nrations which are significant in minimizing and resolving problems.\nThe goals of the Nimbus B mission were deemed sufficiently important to\nwarrant a second Nimbus B program which is presently underway. Launch of\n\n26\n\n?\n\nthis spacecraft, designated Nimbus B2, is scheduled for the spring of 1969. The\ndegree of success of the SNAP-19/Nimbus B integration program is reflected in\nthe fact that Nimbus B2 will incorporate a SNAP-19 power supply in the same\ncapacity as did the prior program.\nSeveral conclusions can be drawn from this review of SNAP-19 integration\nexperience.\nRadioisotope power systems can be physically and functionally integrated\nwith complex spacecraft although some performance tradeoffs might\nbe unavoidable.\nWith respect to SNAP-19 on Nimbus B, most of the significant integration\nproblems were nuclear safety and mechanically oriented. On future\nNASA missions, nuclear radiation, magnetics, and weight minimization\nare likely to be major considerations. Assuming that future RTG systems\nare designed for intact reentry, nuclear safety is likely to have a significantly smaller influence on integration.\nThe user must specify interface and functional requirements at the\nearliest possible point in the program. To minimize retrofit problems,\nboth the RTG and spacecraft must be designed as an integral system\nbased on these requirements.\nThe nuclear safety interface should be thoroughly defined and safety\ndesign criteria specified firmly during the preliminary design phases\nas opposed to late in the program.\nDesign defects and interface incompatibilities should be detected by\ntesting as soon as hardware is available, Delays in testing can be costly.\nIsotope space power system users will require a thorough knowledge\nand understanding of the technology and unique characteristics of RTGs\nin order to assure a successful integration program.\n\n27\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\n\'lNASA-GSFC Nimbus B Mission Operations Plan 2-68," X-513-68-113,\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, April 1968.\n\n2.\n\n"SNAP- 19 Radioisotope Power Supply Technical Manual," MND-360 7-80,\nMartin Marietta Corporation, Baltimore, Maryland, October 31, 1967.\n\n3.\n\n"GSFC Technical Interface Specification for the Nimbus B/SNAP-19 System,"\nS-450-N1-2, NASA-GSFC ; Greenbelt, Maryland, Original Issue December\n1964, Revised March 1965, December 1965, July 1966.\n\n4.\n\n"GSFC Program Specification for the Nimbus B/SNAP-19 System," S-450-N11, NASA-GSFC ; Greenbelt, Maryland, Original Issue December 1964, Revised\nMarch 1965, December 1965, July 1966.\n\n5.\n\n"Radiation Protection Training Manual for the SNAP-lS/Nimbus B at\nVandenburg A i r Force Base," X-450-68-38, NASA-GSFC, Greenbelt, Maryland, January 1968.\n\n6.\n\n"Preliminary Assessment of the Effects of Nuclear Radiation on the Nimbus\nB Spacecraft," HIT-190, Hittman Associates, Inc., Columbia, Maryland,\nMarch 1965 and Addendum I, April 1967.\n\n28\n\n'
