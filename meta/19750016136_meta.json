Explorer 33 and 35 field and plasma data were analyzed on large-scale (hourly) and small-scale (3 min.) during the time interval coincident with initial phase of the geomagnetic storms. The solar-ecliptic Bz component turns southward at the end of the initial phase, thus triggering the main phase decrease in Dst geomagnetic field. When the Bz is already negative, its value becomes further negative. The By component also shows large fluctuations along with Bz. When there are no clear changes in the Bz component, the By shows abrupt changes at the main phase onet. On the small-scale behavior of the magnetic field and electric field (E=-VxB) studied in details for the three events, it is found that the field fluctuations in By, Bz and Ey and Ez are present in the initial phase. These fluctuations become larger just before the main phase of the storm begins. In the largescale behavior field remains quiet because the small scale variations are averaged out.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750016136, "id": "fbf1ba630dbb455da2c956e7b092e1e6", "publicationDate": "1975-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19750016136.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19750016136/downloads/19750016136.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19750016136/downloads/19750016136.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19750016136/downloads/19750016136.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
