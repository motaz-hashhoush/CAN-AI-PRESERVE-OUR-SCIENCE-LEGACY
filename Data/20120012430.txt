b'What influences climate and glacier change in the southwestern\nChina?\n1,2Teppei J, Yasunari\nI\n\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA\n\n2\n\nGoddard Earth Sciences and Technology and Research, Universities Space Research\nAssociation, Columbia, MD 21044, USA\nThe subject of climate change in the areas of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the\n\nHimalayas has taken on increasing importance because of available water resources\nfrom their mountain glaciers (Immerzeel et al., 2010). Many of these glaciers over the\nregion have been retreating, while some are advancing and stable (Yao et al., 2004,\nScherler et al., 2011). Other studies report that some glaciers in the Himalayas show\nacceleration on their shrinkage (e.g., Fujita and Nuimura, 2011). However, the causes of\nthe glacier meltings are still difficult to grasp because of the complexity of climatic\nchange and its influence on glacier issues. However, it is vital that we pursue further\nstudy to enable the future prediction on glacier changes.\nThe paper entitled "Climate and Glacier Change in Southwestern China during the\nPast Several Decades" by Li et al. (2011) provided carefully analyzed, quality\ncontrolled, long-term data on atmospheric temperature and precipitation during a period\nfrom 1961-2008. The data were obtained from 111 Chinese stations. The researchers\ndid systematic analyses of temperature and precipitation over the whole southwestern\nChinese domain. They discussed those changes in terms of other meteorological\ncomponents such as atmospheric circulation patterns, radiation, and altitude difference,\nand then showed how these factors could contribute to climate and glacier changes in\nthe region.\nAir temperature and precipitation are strongly associated with glacier mass balance\nbecause of heat balance and the addition of mass when it snows. Temperature warming\ntrends over many places in the southwestern China were unequivocally dominant in all\nseasons and at higher altitude. This indicates that the heat contribution to the glaciers\nhas been increasing. On the other hand, precipitation has a wider variability in time and\nspace. It is more difficult to clearly understand precipitation\'s effect on the climate and\nglacier melting characteristics in the whole southwestern China as a collective view.\n\nHowever, the precipitation patterns are probably modulated by climate feedbacks\nthrough many factors in southwestern China. Precipitation seasonality may also affect\nclimatic sensitivity of glacier mass balance (Fujita, 2008).\nIn addition to the authors\' main focus above, other factors, also probably directly\nand indirectly, influence the climate and glacier mass balance changes. Those factors\nare: (1) debris-covered effect which heats (if it is thin) or insulates (if it is thick) the ice\nbelow the debris and it probably causes no uniform response on glacier meltings\n(Scherier et aI., 2011); (2) interaction between glacial lakes and exposed ice parts on\nglaciers (e.g., Sakai et al., 2009, Fujita et al., 2009); (3) atmospheric heating effect over\nthe foothills of the Himalayas due to the Atmospheric Brown Cloud (ABC), including\nabsorbing aerosols such as black carbon, dust, and organic matters (Ramanathan et al.,\n2007), the so called Elevated Heat Pump (EHP) effect suggested by Lau et al. (2006,\n20 10); (4) snow darkening effect over non debris-covered parts of glaciers as the\nabsorbing aerosol depositions reduce snow albedo and accelerate snow meltings by\nabsorbing more solar energy at the snow surface (Warren and Wiscombe, 1980, Flarmer\n\net al., 2007, 2009, Yasunari et aI., 2010, Qian et al., 2011); (5) another kind of snow\ndarkening effect over non debris-covered glacier due to the growth of biological\nactivities with dark-colored materials on glacier also reducing snow albedos (Takeuchi\net aI., 2001); (6) Other factors on snow albedo reductions such as snow grain size,\nspecific surface area, and depth changes, melt-water effect on snow, and changes in\nsolar illumination conditions (e.g., Wiscombe and Warren, 1980, Flarmer et al., 2006,\nYasunari et al., 2011, Aoki et aI., 1999, 2011); and finally, (7) feedbacks via\ninteractions between the snow surface and atmosphere including all the factors above.\nWhat I\'d like to emphasize is that the atmospheric warming trend indicated by Li\net al. (2011) is robust and very likely associated with the dominant characteristics of\nglacier shrinkage across southwestern China, as discussed by the authors. However, the\nshrinkage rate of sub-regional scale variability is probably due to the modulations of\nprecipitation, as well as other factors identified above. Further, the atmospheric\nwarming is not limited to only southwestern China, but is also probable in the\nsurrounding Tibetan and Himalayan regions (Gautarn et al., 2010).\nComprehensive studies, including international projects discussing all the\ncontributors above by a) field observations, b) global or regional modeling, and c)\nsatellite data analyses, are essential to assess the future climate change and glacier\nretreat inlaround TP and the Himalayas. The authors\' findings showed robust\ninformation on atmospheric warming trends and some wider variety on precipitation\nduring 1961-2008 in the southwestern China. In addition, they indicated some possible\n\nconnection between these findings and atmospheric circulation, altitudinal difference,\nand meteorological conditions. Future studies should promote a deeper discussion and\nunderstanding of the relationships.\nHereafter, we must make a committed effort to study climate and glacier issues\nin/around TP and the Himalayas involving the existing warming trend. This trend\nfluctuates, year-by-year. The fluctuation of the warming and precipitation changes may\ndirectly contribute to climate change and glacier retreats. But the seven factors noted\nabove likely modulate the climate change and glacier melting patterns in southwestern\nChina on the warming trend in intra- and inter-annual timescales. The temperature and\nprecipitation data in this study offers a terrific asset for future studies on climate and\nglacier issues inlaround this region.\nAcknowledgement\n\nI wish to thank Jan Angevine, at NASA/GSFC, for proofreading.\nReferences\n\nAoki Te, Aoki Ta, Fukabori M and Uchiyama A 1999 Numerical simulation of the\natmospheric effects on snow albedo with a multiple scattering radiative transfer\nmodel for the atmosphere-snow systemJ Meteorolo.
