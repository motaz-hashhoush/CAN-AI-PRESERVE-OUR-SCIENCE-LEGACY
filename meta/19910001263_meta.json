The Space Station and its complement of space vehicles, developed by NASA, will add new dimensions to an already extensive space program in the United States. The Space Station offers extraordinary benefits for a comparatively modest investment (currently estimated at one-ninth the cost of the Apollo Program). The station will provide a permanent multipurpose facility in orbit necessary for the expansion of space science and technology. It will enable significant advancements in life sciences research, satellite communications, astronomy, and materials processing. Eventually, the station will function in support of the commercialization and industrialization of space. Also, as a prerequisite to manned interplanetary exploration, the long-duration space flights typical of Space Station missions will provide the essential life sciences research to allow progressively longer human staytime in space.", "title": "Space station", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:41:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910001263, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stewart, Donald F."}, "organization": {"name": "Krug International", "location": "Houston, TX., United States"}}, "id": "c9841a09c7a649049b6827eaa7ed14ac"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910001263, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hayes, Judith"}, "organization": {"name": "Krug International", "location": "Houston, TX., United States"}}, "id": "621678510915474db995ecac1c3454d8"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910001263, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910001263, "id": "f508303717f3472492d126aade26ce28", "publicationName": "Workshop on Exercise Prescription for Long-Duration Space Flight", "publicationDate": "1989-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19910001261, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Workshop on Exercise Prescription for Long-Duration Space Flight", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910001263.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910001263/downloads/19910001263.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910001263/downloads/19910001263.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910001263/downloads/19910001263.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
