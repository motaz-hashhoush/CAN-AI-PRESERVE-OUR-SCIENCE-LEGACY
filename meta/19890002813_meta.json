Research conducted over the past several years on 3-D spatial instruments has shown that perspective displays, even when viewed from the correct viewpoint, are subject to systematic viewer biases. These biases interfere with correct spatial judgements of the presented pictorial information. It is also found that deliberate, appropriate geometric distortion of the perspective projection of an image can improve user performance. These two findings raise intriguing questions concerning the design of head-mounted spatial instruments. The design of such instruments may not only require the introduction of compensatory distortions to remove the neutrally occurring biases but also may significantly benefit from the introduction of artificial distortions which enhance performance. These image manipulations, however, can cause a loss of visual-vestibular coordination and induce motion sickness. Additionally, adaptation to these manipulations is apt to be impaired by computational delays in the image display. Consequently, the design of head-mounted spatial instruments will require an understanding of the tolerable limits of visual-vestibular discord.", "title": "Head-mounted spatial instruments: Synthetic reality or impossible dream", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T19:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890002813, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ellis, Stephen R."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "09619e82691c4b709e6053eff686cf98"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19890002813, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Grunwald, Arthur"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "b6ecae91749746598e5bed9dd97cd39c"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19890002813, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Velger, Mordekhai"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "3c54566e60cb411ea82bd004c627452c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890002813, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890002813, "id": "01d37b1ff2df4c3ca3fbd2119689998d", "publicationName": "AGARD, Motion Cues in Flight Simulation and Simulator Induced Sickness", "publicationDate": "1988-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
