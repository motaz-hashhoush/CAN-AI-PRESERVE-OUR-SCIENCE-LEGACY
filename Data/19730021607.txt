It is\nbelieved that its implementation will materially assist in decreasing fatalities,\ninjuries and property losses due to transportation-related accidents and in\nincreasing the cost/effectiveness of search forces.\nThe most significant factor in effecting a successful SAR effort is reducing the\ndelay in notifying the rescuing agencies. The average delay experienced has\nbeen from 5. 6 to 7. 5 hours. Even in the best of climatic conditions, such a\nhiatus in relief operations carries critical penalties for safety. By shortening\nthis time, fewer lives would be lost due to exposure, drowning or untreated\ninjuries. It has been estimated that such a system could conservatively save\n425 lives in the United States each year. Extrapolating the figures to worldwide coverage would mean a commensurately higher total.\nThe need for GRAN cuts across the boundaries of all transportation modes. On\nthe one hand, spectacular incidents occur with sporadic frequency. The SS\nTEXACO OKLAHOMA sank on March 27, 1971, with 38 crewmen perishing in\nthe aftermath and potential rescue agencies completely unaware of the event\nuntil four days later. In the ensuing 11 days of fruitless searching, 72,000\nsquare miles of ocean were examined by 6 Coast Guard vessels, 20 aircraft of\nthe Coast Guard, Air Force and Marine Corps, and 7 tankers of the Texaco\nfleet. On the other hand, in individual incidents, lives are lost on almost a\ndaily basis throughout the nation.\nA typical year will find the Coast Guard responding to some 34,000 separate\nSAR incidents requiring assistance to vessels, with about 1600 fatalities.\nAlthough GRAN will not eliminate these deaths, it can serve to diminish the\nnumber.\nLight Civil aircraft form a category of transportation with definite hazards\nand a great potential for a GRAN solution. The Air Force Aerospace Rescue\nand Recovery Service annually searches for some 100 light aircraft and locates\nnearly 90% of them. However, 57 aircraft which crashed in the Continental\nUnited States during the period 1961-1967 have never been found. Over-water\nflights, of course, are more unpredictable and a higher incidence of distress\nlocation difficulty is evident.\nThe economic impact of GRAN is expected to benefit SAR forces and the distressed units. For the distress units, the gain cannot be easily quantified.\nIt is known that the Coast Guard annually saves some two billion dollars in\n\n1\n\nproperty damage by timely and effective action in SAR incidents. If this amount\nwere increased by a conservative 10%, enough would be gained in a single year\nto pay for the GRAN space segment and a sizeable number of Search and Rescue\ncommunicators (SARCOM) for mobile users.\nNor is this the total cost impact. Real and significant operating savings will\naccrue to SAR forces in reduced search costs. A SAR simulation model which\nclosely parallels the GRAN concept has postulated that the search could be done\nfor 2% of the direct costs and with only 4% of the required time as compared to\na visual search. It may be of interest to note that the visual search costs would\npurchase approximately 10,000 SARCOMs at a unit cost of $200 each for the\nhypothetical SAR mission.\nIn recognition of the need for GRAN concepts, many organizations have firmly\nsupported its development. The Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative\nOrganization (IMCO), which is the specialized agency of the United Nations\ndealing with maritime subjects, has cited an operational requirement for the\n"use of low-power emergency radio beacons to enable survivors to alert rescue\ncoordination centers" using satellites. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is actively examining their needs for space services but have not\nyet identified this requirement. However, the general concept of SARCOM\n(nonsatellite) is strongly supported by aviation interests. The Federal Aviation\nAdministration (FAA) will require most general aircraft (some 130,000 in the\nUnited States) to carry crash locator beacons after 1973.\nThe Air Force through its Survival Avionic\'s Life Support System program has\nestablished in conjunction with the Navy and Army, a triservice study to determine the optimum search and rescue system. The requirements of their study\ndetailed in Specification F33657-71-R-0538 call for a SAR avionics package\nconsisting of two units: a Distress Incident Locator (DIL) and a Survivor\nLocator Group (SLG). The DIL shall provide at a central location aircraft\nidentification and aircraft location. The SLG will provide precise location in\nthe range of from 2 to 10 miles to 25 ft. The triservice study, performed by\ntwo independent contractors, recommends a GRAN type system using Advanced\nOPLE techniques. The studies have assumed that GRAN type experimentation\nwill have been completed by 1975 in order to incorporate those results into a\nsystem for military users.\nThe commitment of the Coast Guard and Navy are well-known and backed up by\ntheir participation in this experiment. In the collective view of SAR agencies,\nGRAN offers the chance to bring modern technology to bear on the age-old\nproblem of safety of life at sea, in the air or on the ground.\n\n2\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe NASA OPLE concept evolved from a desire to establish global location and\nto collect data from remote platforms on a real-time basis for scientific\ninvestigation of natural phenomena in meteorology, oceanography, etc. NASA\nsuccessfully demonstrated the concept in 1968 using the ATS-1 and -3 satellites\nto perform experiments with balloons, buoys and land deployed platforms. This\naccomplishment was also significant in that it opened new horizons in research\nand applications which could be achieved through improvement of the ATS/OPLE\nsystem. Accordingly, an Advanced OPLE system study was initiated under the\nNASA/Goddard Supporting Research and Technology Program.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, the Naval Air Test Center (NAVAIRTESTCEN) recognized the potential of the OPLE concept for application to worldwide rescue of\nsurvivors. The important advantages of the system are its real-time features\nand utilization of a minimum number of satellites. In 1970 NAVAIRTESTCEN\ncarried out tests using borrowed NASA/OPLE equipment and facilities which\nwere modified for UHF operation. These tests established the feasibility of\nusing the OPLE concept to design a GRAN which reduces the time between a\nmishap and rescue attempt from hours or days to minutes. The tests are well\ndocumented and resulted in the following specific recommendations:\na.\n\nContinue to develop the GRAN concept with appropriate speed and\nresources.\n\nb.\n\nDevelop and test techniques for resolution of Omega lane ambiguity\nproblem.\n\nc.\n\nRefine the Exalted Acquisition/Reference (A/R) technique (low power\ntone acquisition) to obtain the most economic power budget consistent\nwith desired reliability.\n\nd.\n\nConduct experiments to demonstrate methods for instantaneous\nskywave corrections for improvement of localization accuracy.\n\ne.\n\nDevelop a small hand held emergency transceiver "SARCOM" for test\nand evaluation.\n\nThese goals are synonymous with those established under the Goddard Space\nFlight Center (GSFC) Advanced OPLE Program.\nThus, the development of the GRAN system could be efficiently pursued by\nintegrating respective efforts of NASA and NAVAIRTESTCEN under a joint\n\n3\n\nflight program. The GRAN concept would be advanced to the point where final\nspecifications of a semioperational system could be formulated.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has statutory responsibility of developing, establishing,\nmaintaining and operating rescue facilities for the promotion of safety on and\nover the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\nUnder this mandate, it became interested in the NASA and NAVAIRTESTCEN\nwork, endorsed the goals, and sought to bring the GRAN concept to an operational stage. Accordingly, the Coast Guard was instrumental in obtaining a\nfrequency allocation for the system at the 1971 World Administrative Radio\nConference for Space Telecommunications (WARC-ST) and will cooperate with\nGSFC and NAVAIRTESTCEN in the GRAN experiment and with other SAR agencies in pursuing the operational aspects of a future system.\nThe development of an Advanced OPLE concept will also offer a capability for\nother user applications. It is anticipated that interest will be solicited among\ndata collection users for additional experiments. The U. S. Naval Oceanographic Office has a requirement for real-time buoy tracking experiments to\nimprove ocean current forecasting techniques. Interest has also been\nexpressed by scientists in meteorology and ecology for real-time data gathering\nsystems.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION\n\nThe principal objective of the GRAN experiment is to solve the acute problem\nfacing the various SAR agencies in reducing the time lost between a mishap and\nrescue efforts from hours or days to just minutes. The lifesaving goal will be\nadvanced by demonstrating Advanced OPLE techniques which meet SAR requirements in terms of reliability, accuracy and ultimate user cost. In so doing,\nthe time consuming and costly Search phase will be practically eliminated from\nfuture Search and Rescue missions.\nA secondary objective is to gain much needed practical experience in the efficient management and operation of a worldwide SAR system under real-time\nconditions. It is anticipated that much will be learned regarding real world\nconsiderations in the disposition of men and equipment for such emergencies.\nThe experiment will consist of system technical evaluations and simulated SAR\nmissions. The technical evaluations will consist of test sequences wherein\nplatforms, situated at known sites, will be operated under "worst case" conditions for total system assessment. Simulated Search and Rescue missions will\nserve to demonstrate system features. Ten platforms are required to obtain\nsufficient statistics of simultaneous transmissions from the test regions\n\n4\n\nselected. For example, if the satellite were located at 105 0 W Longitude, the\ntypical sites might be the following:\n1)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n5)\n6)\n7)\n8)\n\nFairbanks, Alaska\nMidway Island\nSamoa\nThule Air Base, Greenland\nAntarctic Peninsula\nEquatorial jungle\nU. S. inland lakes\nU. S. desert\n\nNear each of the above sites sufficient manpower and facilities exist to provide\nneeded support, and most sites are serviced by the Military Airlift Command.\nGeographically, the regions encompass the satellite coverage area in both\nhemispheres, thus providing a wide range of atmospheric and terrain conditions.\nDetails of the experiment are described below.\nA.\n\nTECHNICAL EVALUATION\n1.\n\nDeploy platforms throughout the field of view of the satellite. Selection of sites will be based upon the following:\na.\n\nb.\n2.\n\nCombinations of "worst" and "best case" conditions for VLF and\nUHF frequency characteristics.\nOmega lane geometry and relative distance from transmitters.\n\nFrom each selected site the following tests and evaluations are to be\nperformed:\na.\n\nAbility of system to meet an acceptable success rate in terms of\nalerting and location accuracy and false alarm rate. A successful test consists of receiving a transmission and computing\nposition, within minutes, to the Omega system accuracy.\n\nb.\n\nPerformance under various UHF Signal-to-Noise (S/N) ratios.\n\nc.\n\nPerformance at reduced power levels to ascertain success ratios\nfor each level.\n\nd.\n\nVerification of techniques for resolution of lane ambiguity through\nuse of additional tones, multiple lines of position (recursive\nfiltering), composite line of position correction for diurnal\n5\n\nvariations, time of arrival of the pulse, signal-to-signal measurement, and differential Omega.\ne.\n\nB.\n\nAbility of system to receive and process four simultaneous alarm\ntransmissions.\n\nSAR EVALUATION\n\nA field operation involving two mobile units will be carried out. Mobile units\nwill travel to positions unknown to the central facility; each will initiate an\nalarm transmission. The message will be received, processed and communicated to rescue stations for simulated rescue missions. The intercept, or\ntime to locate the survivor within the mishap area, will be logged along with\nother pertinent data relative to the rescue (weather conditions, etc.). These\ntests will include a mission covering up to 1500 miles (as in a mid-Atlantic\nmishap), and a remote area mishap in the region of the Rocky Mountains. The\ntests will be carried out with rescue aircraft or ships equipped with standard\nnavigation equipment to insure accurate intercept courses. There will also be\ntests conducted using other navigation aids for comparison. A summary of the\ncritical SAR statistics to be measured throughout these tests is as follows:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nAlert/processing time\nCommunicating and dispatching SAR vehicles\nIntercept time (actually spotting the distressed party)\nOverall SAR mission time\n\nA comparison will be made with existing statistical data from the United States\nCoast Guard (USCG), the Air Force Rescue and Recovery (ARRS), and the\nNaval Safety Center (NAVSAFCEN).\nC.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nData from all phases of the experiment will be analyzed and areas of future\nstudy will be identified by the team of investigators. Of particular significance\nis the data on ambiguity resolution, which will result in recommendations to\nthe Omega Steering Committee for changes, if any, to the present Omega format. Other areas in which conclusions and recommendations will be made\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\n1.\n\nThe effect of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) on system performance.\n\n2.\n\nA channelization scheme among the user population which meets\nrequirements for an operational system in the 406-406.1 MHz band.\n6\n\n3.\n\nThe need for multiple, narrow beam spacecraft antennas to permit\nincreased user population and/or reduced power levels in the SARCOM.\n\n4.\n\nThe identification of a suitable frequency band for the link between\nground station and satellite.\n\n5.\n\nPreliminary plan for prototype GRAN system, including satellites\nand ground stations configuration.\n\nIV.\n\nSYSTEM DESCRIPTION\n\nA.\n\nBASIC SYSTEM CONCEPT\n\nThe GRAN concept, based upon an Advanced OPLE principle, is shown in\nFigure 1. The sequence proceeds as follows: 1) distress call is initiated by\na survivor and consists of the retransmission of Omega tones and a unique\nidentifying code (social security number), 2) signals are frequency translated\nthrough the satellite from UHF to SHF, and (3) the received signals are\nprocessed in real-time using improved skywave correction and lane ambiguity\nresolution techniques. The output results in geographical coordinates, time\nof day and unique ID. This information is then relayed to the closest rescue\nagent.\nB.\n\nSATELLITE\n\nThe GRAN experiment, as described, will require a geosynchronous satellite\nequipped with an earth coverage antenna having a gain of at least 8 dB for any\npoint on the covered portion of the earth. Alarm signals from the SARCOMs\nare received by the UHF antenna, frequency translated to an intermediate\nfrequency and passed through a band pass filter having (ideally) a width of\n100 KHz at the 3 dB point. The signals are then amplified in a linear amplifier\nwith Automatic Gain Control (AGC), up-converted to SHF and frequency multiplexed (if necessary) with other wideband satellite sensor data. Because the\nSARCOM signals are narrow band (3.0 KHz) and only require a modest carrier\nto noise ratio (40 dB/Hz), the SARCOM signals, when multiplexed, may be as\nmuch as 20 dB below the wideband data without suffering appreciable degradation. Since the GRAN-unique satellite equipment is small, lightweight, and\nconsumes little power, GRAN can readily share the satellite with other experiments or missions.\nDuring eclipse the GRAN link could be supported with low power in the downlink\neven though a wideband link may have to shut down. The GRAN system power\nbudget link calculations will assume that GRAN receives only a -20 dB share of\n\n7\n\nSATELLITE\n\nDATA\nRELAY\n\nS-BAND\n\nUHF\n\n00\n\nGROUND\nSTATION\n\nWORLD\n\nWIDE\nOMEGA\n\nFSARCOM*\n\nALARM\nTRANSMISSION\n\nIDENTIFICATION\nAND LOCATION\nCOMPUTATION\n\n*SEARCH AND RESCUE\nCOMMUNICATION PLATFORM\n\nFigure 1.\n\nGRAN System Concept\n\navailable satellite downlink power in normal operation but that this same power\nlevel is available during eclipse. The link calculations are discussed below.\nOperational Satellite System\nThe circle of illumination on the earth by an equatorial synchronous satellite\nhas a radius of about 81 degrees of longitude at the equator. This circle is\ncentered on the equator, and extends to within about 9 degrees of each pole.\nWith two synchronous satellites in equatorial orbits spaced on opposite sides\nof the earth, the total coverage would include all but a 17 degree wide segment\ncircling the earth, as illustrated in Figure 2a. With three synchronous satellites in equatorial orbits equally spaced around the earth, complete coverage is\npro-.ided from about 73 degrees north latitude to 73 degrees south latitude.\nThis coverage would extend to the arctic and antarctic circles (located at\napproximately \xc2\xb166 degrees latitude) with a minimum platform-to-satellite\nelevation angle of about 7 degrees. The two spherical triangular areas,\nlocated at the poles, which are not covered are illustrated by Figure 2b. By\nusing one synchronous satellite with an inclined plane, along with two synchronous satellites in the equatorial plane, coverage of each pole could be\nobtained for one continuous period of time each day. The length of this time\nperiod depends on the angle of inclination of the orbital plane to the equatorial\nplane. A plot of the pole visibility time in hours is given in Figure 3 for\nantenna elevation angles of 0, 5 and 10 degrees.\nNORTH POLE\nSATELLITE\n\nSATELLITE\n\nPOLE\nSATELLITE\n\nEQUATOR\n\nSATELLITE\n\n730\n\n0\n6\n\n.7o0\n\nLATITUDE\n\nSOUTH POLE\n\nSATELLITE\n\nFigure 2a.

The inclined plane allows the satellite to look over the\npoles and view the entire area not seen by the other two satellites. Each polar\narea would be entirely covered for a minimum of 4 hours per day. It seems\nthat virtually any realistic operational requirement could be met by three\nphased synchronous satellites, each with properly selected inclination angles.\nAt synchronous altitude, the angle subtended by the earth is 16.4 degrees. This\nwould allow use of an antenna with approximately 20.1 dB gain which would\n10\n\nassuming zero pointing error, provide a minimum of 17.1 dB of gain over the\nentire illuminated area of the earth. An antenna pointing error of 25% (4. 1\ndegrees) would necessitate using an antenna with a gain of 16 dB, which would\nprovide a minimum gain of 13. 7 dB over the illuminated area of the earth.\nThus, the maximum allowable antenna gain is determined by the antenna pointing error, and since 4 degrees of error is well within the capability of present\nmechanical and electrical stabilization systems, a nominal 14 dB gain antenna\nis feasible for an operational system.\nC. PLATFORM\nThe SAR communication platform (SARCOM) proposed for this experiment consists of a modification of the ATS/OPLE design to provide conversion to UHF\nand reduction in size, weight and power. The unit will not require an interrogation receiver since transmissions will be initiated at the SARCOM. A major\nobjective is to provide a unit which can be hand held and provide approximately\n30 minutes of operations, although not necessarily continuous broadcast.\nUnder the Advanced OPLE Program at GSFC, the feasibility of reducing the\npresent platform volume and weight has been established through engineering\nstudies. SARCOM package requirements call for the following:\nVolume\nWeight\nOutput Power\nOperation\nData\n\n50 in.\n2 lbs.\n5 W max.\n3 minute broadcasts repeated at intervals, or one-time\noperation for 30 minutes\nSocial Security Number (36 bits) or other unique identifier\n\nThese specifications will require use of miniaturization techniques. An effort\nhas been initiated under the GSFC SRT program to demonstrate this feasibility.\nPlatforms produced for the GRAN experiment will be based upon the designs\ndeveloped under the GSFC program, and will be representative of user end item\nSARCOM.\nIn operation, platform transmission sequences consist of the following modes:\nMode 1.\nMode 2.\nMode 3.\n\nAcquisition Mode\nData Mode\nOmega Mode\n\nDuring the acquisition mode (Mode 1), the platform transmits an A/R tone at\nfull power output. At the Control Center a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) receiver\nacquires the full power A/R tone.\n11\n\nDuring the data mode (Mode 2), digitized data phase modulates the A/R tone\nsideusing \xc2\xb1600PSK. The platform power output is therefore split between the\nband signal power resulting from the PSK modulation, and the A/R tone, on a\n3:1 basis. At the Control Center, the PLL receiver assumes a narrow-band\ntracking mode (10 Hz) and continues tracking the received, reduced power,\nA/R tone. The output of the PLL receiver is routed to a PSK demodulator and\nthe digitized identifier data extracted.\nDuring the Omega mode (Mode 3), the three Omega tones, filtered VLF noise\naround each of the Omega tones, and the A/R tones share the output power.\nThe spectrum is shown in Figure 4. The basic Omega tone-to-VLF Noise\nPower Ratio is chosen as 0 dB in a 1 Hz bandwidth. By centering the tones in\n100 Hz filters, the platform output power is shared in accordance with Table 1.\nTable 1\nOutput Power Sharing\nShare of\nOutput Power\n\nSignal\n\n%\nA/R Tone\n10.2 KHz tone and associated VLF Noise Power\n11.33 KHz tone and associated VLF Noise Power\n13.6 KHz tone and associated VLF Noise Power\n\ndB\n\n10\n30\n30\n30\n100\n\n-10.0\n-5.22\n-5.22\n-5.22\n\nThroughout this transmission, the PLL receiver continues to track the received\nA/R tone, although the latter has now been even further reduced in power. The\noutput of the PLL receiver is routed to matched 1 Hz filters, the output of\nwhich is integrated for 18 one-second samples, which results in an overall\nimprovement in Omega tone-to-VLF Noise Ratio by a factor of 36. Since final\nposition data is obtained by taking the difference between the transmission of\ntwo Omega tones of the same frequency but from two different Omega stations,\nthe resulting improvement factor is 18.\nA functional block diagram of the platform is shown in Figure 5. The basic\nelements consist of a VLF antenna and receiver, Omega tone filters, two local\noscillators, and a UHF transmitter and antenna. The spectrum of the Omega\nsignal is folded, as shown in Figure 4, to reduce separation between extremes\nof the baseband. This is achieved by dividing the local oscillator frequency and\nmultiplying the received VLF signals in the common "band folding" technique.\nThis technique allows frequency division multiple access while maintaining band\n12\n\nintegrity. Local oscillator F-2 is common to all platforms and is a multiple of\nthe Omega tones. It is used to synthesize all mixing frequencies as well as the\nA/R tone. The second oscillator F-1 determines the platform channel assignment.\nIn operation, transmissions are initiated by the survivor; the present sequence\nthen proceeds as follows:\nTime Interval\n\nEvent\n\n11. 3\n2. 0\n2. 0\n2.0\n180. 0\n\nTransmit A/R tone (5.0 W) (Mode 1)\nTransmit ID (Mode 2)\nResume A/R\nReduce A/R power (0.5 W)\nTransmit Omega (Mode 3)\nTotal Time\n\nsec.\nsec.\nsec.\nsec.\nsec.\n\n197.3 sec.\n\nThe 15 second approximation for A/R tone transmission time is based upon\nreceived C/KT at the ground station to achieve 99% probability of phase lock.\nThe actual time will be determined during the experiment study phase where\nvarious options and tradeoffs will be made.

At the present time, it is expected that enlargement\nof the computer capacity will satisfy the majority of requirements.\n1.\n\nOCC Functions\n\nThe OCC performed six basic functions in the OPLE system; all but one will\nbe used in the GRAN Experiment. First, it generated and transmitted platform\ninterrogations to the satellite. This function will not be used with the GRAN\nExperiment. Second, it received, demodulated, and stored sensor data transmitted from the platforms to the OCC via the satellite. The GRAN SARCOM\nwill send identification data instead of sensor data, but formatting will be similar. As its third function, the OCC received, demodulated, and processed the\nplatform OMEGA data into the format required by the off-line computer for\nsubsequent platform position determination. The GRAN Experiment proposes\nto process OMEGA data on-line using an enlarged computer capacity. Fourth,\nthe OCC controlled the entire OPLE system operation, provided the required\ntiming functions, and synchronized the OPLE system to the OMEGA Navigation\nSystem. The fifth function of the OCC was to simulate up to 40 OPLE platforms\n(useful but not essential to the GRAN experiment). Sixth, the OCC continuously\nmonitored the status of the Omega Navigational System.\n2.\n\nOCC VLF Data Processing Technique\n\nBy far the most critical function performed by the OCC is the processing of\nplatform Omega data. This function can be separated into three basic tasks:\n(1) demodulation of the platform Omega tones, (2) measurement of the phases\nof these tones, and (3) compensation for frequency errors in the platform\nOmega data. A functional block diagram of the OCC Omega data processor is\nshown in Figure 6. As indicated, phase-locked demodulators accept the IF\noutput of the receiver, phase-lock to the selected A/R tones, and demodulate\nthe platform Omega tones. The outputs of each phase-locked demodulator are\nthree low-frequency tones (426 Hz, 707 Hz, and 941 Hz) which represent the\n10.2-kHz, 11.33-kHz, and 13.6-kHz platform Omega tones, respectively. Each\nplatform Omega tone is then conditioned and applied to two identical synchronous\n\n15\n\nRF ELECTRONICS SUBSYSTEM\n\nVLF RECEIVER SUBSYSTEM\n\nCONTROL ELECTRONICS\nSUBSYSTEM\n\nRECEIVER\nIF OUTPUT\n\nREFERENCE\n\nOTHER\nANALOG\n\nFREQUENCY\n\nINPUTS\n\n426 Hz 0o\n\nPHASE-LOCKED\nDEMODULATOR\n(1 OF 4)\n\n426 Hz\n\nLIMITER\nAND\nFILTER\n\nSYNCHRONOUS\nDETECTOR\n(1 OF 24)\n\n(1OF 12)\n\n707 Hz\n\nTO941-Hz\n\nREFERENCE\nFREQUENCY\n\nPROCESSOR\n\n941Hz\n\nANALOG\nINTEGRATOR\n(1 OF 24)\n\nSIN\n\nANALOG\nMULTIPLEXER\n\n426 Hz 90P\n\nTO 707-Hz\nPROCESSOR\n\nCOS\n\nSYNCHRONOUS\n\n4\n\nANALOG\n\nDFECTOR\n(1 OF 24)\n\nINTEGRATOR\n(1 OF 24)\n\nCONARTER\n\nTO REMAINING\n3 PHASE-LOCKED\nDEMODULATORS\nDIGITAL\nCOMPUTER\n\nCOMPUTER\nSUBSYSTEM\n\nFigure 6.\n\nFunctional Block Diagram of OCC Omega Data Processor\n\ndetectors which are driven by reference frequencies equal to the specified tone\ninput frequency. The only difference in the synchronous detectors is that the\nreference frequencies for the two detectors are 90 degrees out of phase. As\nshown in Figure 6, the outputs of the synchronous detectors are applied to\nanalog integrators which have time constants of approximately one second and\noutput noise bandwidths of approximately 1 Hz. The outputs of the analog\nintegrators represent the sines and cosines of the Omega input tones (relative\nto the reference tones). These sine and cosine outputs are applied through\nanalog multiplexer switches to an analog-to-digital converter where the analog\nsignals are converted to digital representations of the platform Omega tone\nphases. The encoded platform Omega phase data is then stored in the OCC\ndigital computer memory for further processing.\nA significant feature of the OCC Omega processor is that the Omega tone phase\nmeasurements are made open-loop. That is, phase-lock loops are not required\nfor the phase measurements. The advantages offered by this open-loop phase\nmeasurement technique are:\n*\n\nZero acquisition time is required because of the absence of the\nphase-lock loops.\n\n*\n\nResidual phase errors can be eliminated without continuous tracking\nof the Omega tones.\n\n*\n\nAn arbitrarily low noise bandwidth can be achieved by further integration in the digital computer.\n\n*\n\nFrequency errors on the Omega tones can be accommodated.\n\nThe digital computer processing of the encoded Omega phase data involves three\nbasic tasks. First, the computer must measure and compensate for any frequency errors (doppler shift frequencies) on the Omega tones. Second, it must\naverage the tone phase values over approximately a three-minute time period\nto obtain useful signal-to-noise ratios. Third, the OCC Omega data processor\nmust compensate for the small differences in transmission times of each tone\nfrom the various Omega transmitters. The OCC computer processing of the\nOmega data is described in more detail in "Design Study Report for Omega\nPosition Location Equipment Control Center," Report No. 3-815800-3, Texas\nInstruments Incorporated, 14 October 1966.\nE.\n\nOMEGA SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Omega Navigational System was developed at the Naval Electronics Laboratory with assistance from several other organizations including the Harvard\n17\n\nCruft Laboratory and the Naval Research Laboratory. Evolution of the Omega\nsystem followed an extensive investigation of very-low-frequency (VLF) propagation characteristics throughout the last decade. One result of these investigations has been to show that the 10 kHz region of the VLF spectrum has a very\nlow attenuation rate and exhibits exceptional phase stability. These characteristics permit worldwide propagation of radio waves and allow phase measurements with an rms variation of less than five microseconds. Within this\nfrequency range the radiated energy is propagated as a guided wave in the space\nbetween the earth and the reflecting ionosphere with an attenuation rate of\nnearly that due to inverse spreading loss. Near tl.: transmitter interference\nbetween the ground wave and the single-mode guided wave transmission cause\nphase shifts of considerable magnitude. Beyond a few hundred miles the singlemode propagation dominates and the signal can be used for position measurements up to a distance of at least 5000 miles from the transmitter. Frequencies\nbetween 10 and 14 kHz were chosen for use with Omega because of the high\nexcitation of the first mode and the low interference effects at sunrise and sunset of the higher mode.\nThe optimization of the Omega frequencies with respect to the above characteristics of the transmission medium has been verified by experimental results.\nThe experimental phase of the Omega program is essentially completed and an\noverall operational design of considerable flexibility has been established and\nis being implemented. The Omega Project Office, under the Chief of Navy\nMaterial, has been established to direct the construction of the entire Omega\nnetwork. Three pre-operational stations have been constructed and are providing coverage over the northwestern quadrant of the earth. The complete\nOmega network could be operational by 1976 with the construction of eight\noperational stations.\nThe operational Omega System will consist of eight VLF transmitting stations\neach radiating 10 kilowatts of power, with an average separation between stations of about 5000 nautical miles. Each station will transmit, in time sequence,\nthree frequencies, 10.2 kHz, 11.33 kHz, and 13.6 kHz that are harmonically\nrelated to a precise frequency standard. In addition, each station may be\nassigned a unique transmission frequency that will permit station identification.\nFigure 7 presents the Omega signal frequency and timing format. The letters\nA through H identify the transmitting stations. Blank timing intervals would be\nused for station identification transmissions.\nIt is expected that all eight transmissions will be receivable at nearly every\npoint on earth and that at least five of the eight will produce usable signals with\nonly a short monopole receiving antenna. The Omega receiver measures the\nrelative phase of the signals from at least two pairs of stations, i.e., three\ntransmitters. Two lines of position (isophase contours) are generated by the\n18\n\nphase difference between each of the two transmitter pairs and the position of\nthe receiver is established by the intersection of the two isophase hyperbolic\ncontours. The very long base lines between stations results in position lines\nthat diverge only slightly and that cross each other at nearly right angles. This\ngeometric excellence, along with the high degree of phase stability and low\nattenuation rates of VLF radio signals, results in a reliable system with good\nabsolute accuracy that varies little with geographical position.\nThe uncertainty in an Omega line of position can be summarized as one standard\ndeviation of about three-tenths of a mile over a daytime propagation path and\nabout twice that at night. By the time the Omega network becomes operational,\nit is expected that the rms fix error, for all causes combined, will be about\none mile in the daytime and two miles at night. In recent tests performed by\nthe Naval Research Laboratory, the rendezvous or station keeping accuracies\nattained were around 200 yards. Thus, a fixed station can provide very accurate relative position measurements (and velocity measurements through\ncontinual tracking) of platforms over a large area.\n\nSTATION\nA\n\nB\n\n1O21 13.6 111.33\n\nE0.\n\n131.363\n136\n13.6\n\n13.6\n\n11.33\n\n10.2\n\n13.6\n\n1133\n\n10.2\n\n13.6\n\n11.33\n\n10.2\n\nD\n\n11.33\n\n10.2\n\n10.2\n\nC\n\n13.6\n\nE\nF\nG\n\n11.33\n\nH\n\n13.6\n\nI\n\n11.33\n\n0.94\n0.2\n\n1.0\n\n11 0.2\n\nII\n0.2\n\n1.\n\n0.2\n\ni\n\n1.2-4\n0.2\n10 SEC\n\n1\n0.2\n\n-0.94 1-1.24\n0.2\n\nk1.0\n\n0.2\n\n*SIGNAL FREQUENCIES IN kHz\nFigure 7.\n\nOmega Transmitted Signal Time and Frequency Format\n\n19\n\nHyperbolic Navigation Technique\nAt any locus on the earth\'s surface there will be a fixed phase angle difference\nbetween the signals received from a pair of stations transmitting on a common\nfrequency. This line of constant phase difference (isophase line) is represented\nby a hyperbola. An Omega receiver measures the relative phase of signals\nfrom at least two pairs of stations, i.e., three transmitters. Two lines of\nposition (LOPs), isophase contours, are generated by the phase differences\nbetween each of two transmitter pairs. The position of the receiver is established by the intersection of these constant phase difference contours.\nReceiver motion causes the phase angle difference to change. Therefore, when\nthe receiver moves a distance equal to one-half wavelength of an Omega frequency, the phase difference reading changes by one cycle (360 electrical\ndegrees). The LOPs separated by one cycle define a lane the difference\nmeasurements of which are repetitive from lane to lane leading to ambiguities\nin position determination that must be resolved.\nBecause the three Omega transmitted frequencies are derived from a common\nfrequency standard, their phase relationships are very stable. Thus, the phase\ndifferences between the transmitted signals can be used to define lanes of\nincreased width. For example, the 1.13-kHz phase obtained by taking the difference between the 11.33-kHz and 10. 2-kHz phases can be used to define a lane\nwidth of 72 nautical miles on the baseline between two stations.\nInitially the Omega System was to have lower frequency tones modulating the\nthree transmitted tones. Use of these modulating tones would allow lane widths\nof up to 8000 miles to be obtained. However, this aspect of the Omega System\nwill not be implemented. Other methods that are used to resolve lane ambiguities are lane counting from an initial lane of known location and occasional dead\nreckoning position determination using other navigational techniques.\nIn the operational Omega System the use of long baselines and the worldwide\ndistribution of stations will ensure that lane widths that exhibit little spreading\nwill be available at any location on the earth\'s surface. Off the baseline\nbetween a pair of stations, the hyperbolic LOPs begin to diverge from each\nother, leading to increasing lane widths. It can be shown that the lane width at\nany receiver position is proportional to the cosecant of one-half the angle\nbetween the two stations, as measured from the position. The calculation of\nthe angle is performed using spherical trigonometry where all the distances\nare measured in arcs of great circles. Thus, as the receiver moves farther\noff the baseline, a given error in determination of phase difference corresponds\nto an increasing error in determining position location.\n\n20\n\nSkywave Correction Factor\nOmega receivers use the skywave component of the propagated VLF energy in\nmeasuiing the phase difference between transmissions from two stations. The\nskywave phase velocity is a function of many parameters, and its magnitude\nbetween the transmitter and any location varies with the time of day, and the\nday of the year. To accommodate these variations in phase velocity, a skywave\ncorrection scheme is employed.\nCharts are published with LOPs corresponding to a theoretical skywave phase\nvelocity. Tables are published containing skywave correction factors that are\na function of transmitter location, receiver location, hour, and day, and are\nto be added to or subtracted from Omega chart LOPs. These correction factors\nare determined from the magnitude by which the theoretical phase velocity differs from the true phase velocity. They are calculated with equations based on\nphase measurements taken over a period of years at various locations.\nAt present, skywave correction factors are published for 10.2 kHz and 3.4 kHz.\nThe uncertainty in the skywave correction factor is one of the major sources of\nerror in the Omega System. Unpredictable perturbations in the VLF propagation velocities are another source of error.\nDifferential Omega\nThe differential Omega technique is used to overcome the uncertainty introduced\ninto Omega position determination by the skywave correction factor. In this\ntechnique a monitor station is located at a fixed position where the coordinates\nare accurately known. The skywave correction factor for the location can be\nfound from the published tables. At any instant the monitor station can determine the error between the phase differences of the received Omega signals\nand the values obtained from the correction table and charts. This instantaneous\nerror can be broadcast to Omega users in the area who use it to correct their\nposition determinations. The resultant position determination error of the\nuser will be a function of the distance from the user to the monitor. If the distance becomes large, the skywave correction is inaccurate.\nF.\n\nOMEGA LANE AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION\n\nThe position-location ambiguity in the Omega system, as now implemented\nresults in a lane width of 72 NM which is clearly inadequate for GRAN. The\nsimplest technical solution is that of adding low frequency modulation of\n226-2/3 Hz, 45-1/3 Hz and 11-1/3 Hz to generate land width of 360 NM, 1800\nNM and 7200 NM, respectively, to the existing three tones of 10.2 KHz,\n11-1/3 KHz and 13.6 KHz. The above tones have already been suggested as\n21\n\nlow frequency modulation on the already existing three tones. Unfortunately,\nthis solution is not feasible because of two reasons. First, the addition of low\nfrequency modulation is prohibitively expensive as the cost will be about $10\nmillion per station. Secondly, these tones would interfere with presently existing Omega receivers both in the United States and abroad.\nTo overcome this difficulty, it is proposed that the additional tones be derived\nin the same manner as the already existing tones (without modulation). This is\nfeasible because the antenna bandwidth requirements will not change significantly\nand the cost of implementing this change is less than 100K per station. There\nare, however, difficulties with this system, i.e., fitting tones with certain\nconstraints in restricted\' bands to guard against interference with existing\nOmega receivers.\nThis leads to the solution proposed below. It is proposed that the lane ambiguity\nbe resolved for 360 NM and 1800 NM by adding of two tones and that the remaining ambiguity (over 1800 NM) be resolved by measurements of the relative\nsignal strength from different stations. These techniques will now be described.\n1.\n\nSignal-to-Signal Ratio Comparison\n\nThis method is based on the fact that the amplitude of VLF signals decreases in\nstrength approximately inversely with distance. Preliminary computations\nindicate a location accuracy of \xc2\xb1300 NM at the baseline between Omega stations\nand \xc2\xb1750 NM at the furthest location from the baseline, which is certainly within\nthe 1800 NM accuracy required. An understanding of this technique may be\nderived from the following example.\nConsider a platform located at P some distance off the baseline of Omega\nstations A and B which might be some 5000 NM apart as shown in Figure 8.\nLOP\nP1\n\nA\n\nB\nAB = 5000NM\nAP = 1000NM\nPP\'= 300NM\nFigure 8.\n\nAP\' = 1290NM\nBP\' = 3900NM\nBP = 4190NM\n\nComparative Signal Paths\n\n22\n\nIn particular, consider the case where the platform, at position P is 1000 NM\nfrom A and 4190 NM from B. Let the platform be relocated by 300 NM to position P\' in a direction perpendicular to the LOP so that position P\' is approximately 1290 NM from A and 3900 NM from B. Referring to Figure 9 the signal\nfrom A then decreases by about 9 dB and the signal from B increases by about\n7 dB.\nInspection of the 10 kHz curve in Figure 9 indicates that the change in signal\nstrength per 300 NM (550 KM) is generally larger than 7 dB, an easily measureable quantity.\nThe two SNR\'s from A and B are first measured. Since the noise level is constant during the measurement the difference of the two signal-to-noise ratios in\ndB can be calculated and a Hyperbolic Line of Position obtained.\n2.\n\nAdditional Tones\n\nThe two additional tones can be implemented in two ways: either by transmitting\ntwo tones in the 10.2-11-1/3 kHz band or by utilizing two of the proposed timing\nand synchronization tones in the 11.5-13.6 kHz band with certain modifications.\nThe two proposed tones are 10.880 kHz and 10.774 kHz producing lane widths of\n360 and 1800 nautical miles, respectively. These tones can be easily generated\nin the frequency synthesizer of the Omega station by frequency division techniques. Furthermore, the differences of these tones from others result in\n226-2/3 and 45-1/3 Hz, respectively, which are proper submultiples of the\nalready existing difference tones. (This implies that the new lanes contain an\ninteger number of smaller lanes.) These tones lie in the allowable 230 Hz band\n(10,700 Hz - 10,933-1/3 Hz) thus satisfying the non-interference requirement.\nPreliminary discussions with the Omega Office indicate that the Omega Office\nis very receptive to our problem and they will make an effort to satisfy our\nrequirements within their financial means and authority.\n3.\n\nMultiple Lines of Position (MLOP)\n\nThis technique would employ the well known iterative estimation process called\nKalman Filtering and would utilize the redundant lines of position generated by\nsignals from four or more OMEGA stations. It may be seen in Figure 10 that\nthree LOP\'s intersect perfectly only at the true location. At present only four\nOMEGA stations are interim operation; by 1975 eight will be in operation,\nproviding global coverage. Some preliminary results have already been obtained which indicate that the MLOP technique is feasible.\n\n23\n\njUV/m\n120\n\n106\n\n105\n\n100 -\n\n10\n\n80500 kHz (600m)\n300 kHz (1000m)\n200 kHz (1500m)\n\n60-\n\n150kHz\n60 kHz\n30 kHz\n15 kHz\n10 kHz\n7.5\n5\n3\n2\n1.5\n1\n\n40\n\n20-\n\nMHz\nMHz\nMHz\nMHz\nMHz\nMHz\n\n40m).\n(60m)\n(100m)\n(150m)\n(200m)\n(300m)\n\n103\n\n(2000m)\n(5000m)\n(10000m)\n2\n( 0000m)\n(30000m)\n-\n\n\'\n\n102\n\n\'\n\n- 10\n\n700 kHz (429m\n\n1\n\n-20 -101\n1\n\n100\n\n10\n\nFigure 9.\n\nGround-wave Propagation Curves\n\nSea, a = 4 mho/m, e = 80; A: Inverse distance curve\n\n1000\n\n10000 km\n\nLOP 3\n\nLOP 1\n\nFigure 10.\n\nGeometry of Redundant Grid Points\n\n4.\n\nTime of Arrival\n\nThis technique uses the whole waveform transmitted by the OMEGA stations.\nThe effect is that the ambiguity frequency is 10 seconds, the repetition period\nof the OMEGA transmission. The signals from the two (2) OMEGA stations\ncould, in concept, be cross correlated to obtain the difference in time of\narrival; however, the required level of quantization is not practically achievable in view of the magnitude of the ambient noise. To overcome this problem\nthe configuration of Figure 11 is used. A calibration platform is located in the\nvicinity of OMEGA station A. The signal from station A is transmitted to the\nsatellite through two paths, the calibration platform and the platform P. The\ncross correlation of these two signals is maximized to obtain the difference in\ntime of arrival T1 .\nT 1 = tpl + ts - tcl - t 1\n\nWhere the above parameters are shown in Figure 11, tcl and t1 are known\nand 7, is measured by the correlation technique.\nSimilarly for the signal from OMEGA station B the difference in time of arrival\nof the signal throughout the platform P and the calibration platform P is\n= tp2 + t s - tc2 - t 1\n\n2\n\nwhere tc2 and t 2 are known and 72 is measured by auto correlation techniques;\nsubtracting T2 from \'T\n^( -\n\n2\n\n=\n\ntpl - tp2\n\n+\n\ntc2 - tcl\n\nor\n\ntpl - tp 2 =\n\n72 +\n\ntcl -tc2\n\nthe right hand of the equation is either measurable or known.\nDividing by the propagation velocity we obtain\nxpl - xp2 =\n\nConstant\n\nwhere xl, x 2 , are the distances of the platform from A and B.\nThe above equation indicates a hyperbolic line of position with no ambiguity.\nObviously this technique requires less than eight calibration platforms.\n26\n\nts\nGROUND\nSTATION\nCALIBRATION\nPLATFORM\ntC1\n\nC2\n\nOMEGA\nSTATION A\nOMEGA\nSTATION B\ntP2\n\nPLATFORM\n\nFigure 11.\n\nSignal Paths\n\nV.\n\nSATELLITE/GRAN COMPATIBILITY\n\nThe ground rules to be followed in the design of the GRAN system will stress\ncompatibility. with the synchronous satellite facilities to the greatest extent\npossible. The major areas of concern are the following:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nBandwidth utilization\nReturn link i-f interface and stability\nTransponder scheduling\nCarrier frequency,.\n\nTransponder scheduling will require allocation of the satellite for periods of\napproximately 30 minutes. This should allow time for transmission, computation and retransmission of locational coordinates, and provide a reasonable\nmargin. As the experiment progresses, this period will be reduced to the\nminimum. possible. The selection of center frequency within the transponder\nbandwidth must be determined by NASA personnel. At the 1971 WARC meeting\nin Geneva the band from 406.0 to 406.1 MHz was dedicated to worldwide satellite\nSAR. In the next major phase of the GRAN experiment efforts will be made to\ndevelop equipment at the SAR frequency on a NASA application satellite.\n\nVI.\n\nLINK CALCULATIONS\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the system consists of a central ground facility, the geosynchronous satellite and remote platforms. The platforms will be deployed\nover the coverage area of the satellite encompassing depression angles from 5\nto 90 degrees. Communication from the platform is at UHF, at the frequency\nof 406.0 to 406.1 MHz. Communication to the ground station is at SHF. The\nsystem design will provide for up to 25 simultaneously transmitting platforms.\nA.\n\nSARCOM TO SATELLITE TO GROUND\n\nThe calculations for the SARCOM-to-satellite portion of the reporting link are\nshown in Table 2. It is seen that the carrier-to-noise density ratio at the input\nto the transponder is 35.7 dB/Hz and 31.0 dB/Hz for the high and low depression\nangle platform, respectively.\nThe carrier-to-noise density ratio calculated for the satellite-to-ground station\nportion of the reporting link is expected to be at least 50 dB/Hz. Since this is\nover 14 dB greater than the highest carrier-to-noise density ratio for the UHF\nuplink of 35.7 dB/Hz, the degradation is at most 0.1 dB. It will, therefore, be\nassumed that the resulting carrier-to-noise density ratio on the ground is at\nleast 31. 0 dB/Hz for up to four reporting platforms.\n28\n\nB.\n\nA/R TONE ACQUISITION AND TRACKING\n\nThe calculation of margin attainable at the ground station for the 50 to 450 and\n450 to 900 depression angle platforms are shown in Table 3. The margins\napply to the A/R tone only during acquisition and tracking. The C/KT received\nat the satellite can be assumed at the ground in accordance with the preceding\nparagraph. Allowing an 8 dB S/N margin for 99% probability of lock, the\nacquisition bandwidth becomes prime factor insofar as the margins are concerned. Since a 5 to 6 dB margin is desired, the receiver PLL bandwidth is in\nthe order of 50 Hz. Threshold extension teclmhniques will be investigated for\npossible reduction in acquisition time.\nC.\n\nSARCOM DIGITIZED DATA\n\nIn a similar manner to that described in Section VI calculation of the margins\nattainable during demodulation of the received platform digitized sensor data\nwere accomplished and are shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 2\nLink Calculation (Reporting Link)\nSARCOM to Satellite*\nFrequency: 406.0 MHz\nHigh Dep.

It is assumed that the VLF\nnoise density is constant across the VLF receiver band. It is further assumed\nthat all but 10% of the platform output power is contained in the three tone bands\nare\n(each 100 Hz wide). The Omega tones and associated VLF noise power\nHz. Using the values in the report,\ntherefore contained in a total bandwidth of 300\n"OPLE System Power Budget," and calculating, the degradation of approximately\n1 dB results. This may be recovered by either increasing platform transmitter\noutput power or increasing the number of Omega samples taken. Neither option\nadversely affects the objectives of the GRAN experiment if implemented. However, it is doubtful that such action will be required.\n\n30\n\nVII.\nA.\n\nPROGRAM PLAN AND SCHEDULE\nMANAGEMENT\n\nThe period of activity for the experiment is logically divided into two phases.\nThe first is the study and development and testing of hardware and software\nequipment. The second is the field operational testing, followed by analysis\nand reporting of findings. The first phase has been primarily the responsibility\nof GSFC with the NAVAIRTESTCEN and USCG providing support in the generation of SAR specifications concerning hardware size, weight and configuration\nand processing requirements. Technical support will also be rendered by\nNAVAIRTESTCEN and USCG through attendance at design reviews.\nThe second phase will be primarily the responsibility of USCG and NAVAIRTESTCEN and will consist of providing necessary plans, personnel, equipment\nand facilities for carrying out testing around the globe. The analysis and\nreporting of results will be a cooperative effort between the respective agencies.\nUpon completion of the experiment, it will be the responsibility of the USCG to\npursue the operational aspects of a future system through cooperation with\nvarious SAR agencies.\nB.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\nCoordination between NASA, other government agencies or special groups as\nneeded to obtain authorization for use of a synchronous satellite will be the\nresponsibility of NASA Headquarters. The detailed responsibilities of the\nGRAN experiment could be as follows:\nGSFC:\n1)\n\nThe study, design, test and operation phases of the GRAN experiment.\n\n2)\n\nTechnological aspects of the experiment including interface between\nGRAN and the synchronous satellite and processing and documentation\nof data.\n\n3)\n\nDelivery of prototype platform units to NAVAIRTESTCEN in accordance with mutually agreed upon specifications.\n\n4)\n\nAssisting other investigators in administration and coordination of\nexperiment.\n\n5)\n\nParticipating in and coordination of publications relating to the\nexperiment.\n\n31\n\nNAVAIRTESTCEN:\n1)\n\nProviding support in the development of the system design.\n\n2)\n\nGeneration of detailed operational plan for, and conduct of, field tests.\n\n3)\n\nAnalysis and interpretation of data.\n\n4)\n\nParticipating in and coordination of publications relating to the\nexperiment.\n\nThe U.

The work is\ndivided into four major categories. These are:\n1)\n2)\n3)\n4)\n\nStudy and design\nHardware development\nOperational testing\nData analysis\n\nThe work to be accomplished under the major categories is as follows:\nStudy and Design\nThe study and design work will consist of the following subtasks:\n\n32\n\nQUARTER\n\n1\n\n2\n\nSystem Study/Algorithms\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n9\n\nSystem Specification\nSARCOM Development\n\n12\n\nPrototype\n(DELIVERY OF 4 PER MONTH)\n\nProcurement (10 units)\nProduction (4/mo)\nPROCUREMENT\n\nACTION\n\nMODIFICATION\n\n12 MOS.\n\nGround Station Modification\n\n12 MOS.\n\n6\n\nIntegration/Test\nPersonnel Training\nLaunch (optimum time)\nOperations\n\n12\n15\n\nData Analysis\n\n6\n\nFinal Report Prep.\nComplete Final Report\n\nA\n\n,\n\nMilestone\nActivity Period\n\nFigure 12.\n\nMilestones-and Schedule\n\n19\n\n20\n\n1.\n\nSystem Engineering\na.\nb.\n\nIdentification and specification of major system interfaces.\n\nc.\n\nEnd-to-end system performance specifications.\n\nd.\n2.\n\nAnalytic calculations necessary to identify the detail system parameters.\n\nSubsystem performance specifications.\n\nProcessing Algorithms\na.\nb.\n\nLane ambiguity resolution study and processing requirements.\n\nc.\n3.\n\nHardware/software tradeoffs.\n\nSystem software simulation.\n\nSupporting Studies\na.\n\nImproved platform VLF receivers.\n\nb.\n\nDifferential Omega.\n\nc.\n\nSkywave correction improvement.\n\nThe total effort will require 12 months for completion; however, specifications\nand interfaces needed to begin ground station design and final platform design\nwill be sufficiently detailed within the first six months. The final months of the\nstudy and design will coincide with ground station and platform development\ncontracts described below.\nHardware\na.\n\nPlatform Prototype-A contract was let in August 1971 with the General\nInstrument Corporation of Hicksville, L.I., N.Y., for development of a\nprototype Advanced OPLE platform. The effort was completed in June 1973\nunder the NASA Advanced OPLE SRT program. The design is a representative\nGRAN SARCOM package, and is configured in accordance with SAR specifications detailed in this proposal. Emphasis is placed on reproducibility\nas well as small size and weight.\n\nb.\n\nGround Station-Upon approval of the experiment, procurement action will\nbe initiated for Ground Station modifications and improvements. The effort\nwill mainly consist of implementing the processing algorithms developed\nunder the study program. A significant level of interface between the\nrespective contractors\' efforts is therefore required. The new ground\n34\n\nstation design will feature random access capability, real-time data\nprocessing, and advanced input signal acquisition and extraction techniques.\nA significant level of system testing will be carried out prior to shipment\nof equipment. However, final testing and operator training will be completed at the installation site.\n\nc.\n\nPlatform Production-A procurement action will be initiated for the platforms. Bids will be solicited on a competitive basis.\n\nOperational Testing\nSystem testing will begin at ground station contractor\'s site using the prototype\nplatform and modified station equipment before launch. Final testing must be\n. conducted at the station installation site. Five to six months of checkout is\nplanned, as shown in Figure 12, prior to commencement of experimental\noperations. A satellite simulator will be designed into the ground station.\nData Analysis\nAnalysis of engineering and system performance data will form an integral part\nof the experiment throughout all operational phases. Daily log sheets, computer printout, and magnetic tape will be used to store data. Support from\ncontractors will be used in system evaluation. NASA, NAVAIRTESTCEN and\nthe USCG share equal responsibility in the analysis and reporting; a final\nexperiment report will be coauthored.\nFigure 12 describes the tasks to be completed at each of the selected test sites.\nThese efforts will begin following system testing, and will require 12 months\nto complete. A minimum of 500 independent transmission sequences are\nrequired for sufficient statistical data at each site. This corresponds to 5\nhours of satellite operating time; five working days are allocated for collection\nof this data. Following the engineering test sequences, two weeks are allocated\nfor practice SAR missions. The exact nature and duration of the SAR missions\nwill be defined and reviewed with the cooperation of SAR agencies prior to\noperations.\n\nNASA-GSFC\n\n35\n\n'
