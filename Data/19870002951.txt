The value of\ncomprehensive planning was proven by the successes of the resultant\nreorganized staff and research activities. In each year since its inception\nthe planning activity has been oriented to the Center\xe2\x80\x99s needs and\nadapted to the current internal and external environment.\nDuring the strategic planning activity in 1983 the groundwork was laid for\nthe Center\xe2\x80\x99s entry into NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Station Program, the Advanced\nTurboprop Program, the Altitude Wind Tunnel Project, and the Advanced\nCommunications Technology Satellite Project. Many of the objectives in\nthe 1983 plan were established to prepare the Center for the emergence\nof these new research opportunities.\nThe objectives for this year\xe2\x80\x99s strategic planning activity were to reexamine the Center\xe2\x80\x99s research\nprograms and discipline organizations in the light of these new research and development opportunities.\nEmphasis was given to formulating key research disciplines as basic building blocks in support of the\nCenter\xe2\x80\x99s major research projects. A new organization was formed to provide optimum support to the\nCenter\xe2\x80\x99s total effort. This brochure presents the results of this planning activity.\nIt is perhaps of even greater importance to our effectiveness that we increase our efforts to foster and\ninstitutionalize the participative management style at the Center. Clearly, for the Center to succeed, all\nmanagers must embrace and practice these concepts of people involvement and consensus decision\nmaking as a way of increasing organizational effectiveness and productivity.\nWe will continue to support this effort through education for all managers by using the LEP-MEP-SEP\nintegrated developmental strategy. This will be supplemented by developing new programs aimed at\nmiddle managers to ensure their understanding and commitment to this process. We will also continue\nour efforts to involve nonsupervisory employees by expanding the number of active quality circles at the\nCenter and by developing new or expanded educational programs. These programs will be designed to\nincrease awareness, understanding, and commitment to participative management practices on the part\nof all employees.\nThe focus of this effort will be to create a management environment based on openness and\ninvolvement.\n\nI consider the strategic planning process a necessary, evolutionary, and useful function that will be\ncontinued at Lewis. Through this process we clearly define the Center\xe2\x80\x99s missions, determine the\nresources required to carry them out, and ensure efficient use of those resources. By involving the\nCenter\xe2\x80\x99s entire staff through the participative management process, this strategic plan becomes a\nreality. Together, we are taking action to chart the Center\xe2\x80\x99s course.\nAndrew J. Stofan\nDirector\n\nOur Mission\nThe NASA Lewis Research Center defines and develops advanced technology for high-priority national\nneeds. The activities of the Center are directed toward new propulsion, power, and communications\ntechnologies for application to aeronautics and space, to help ensure U.S. leadership in these areas.\n\n2\n\nStrategic Planning Objectives\nDuring this year\xe2\x80\x99s planning activity special emphasis was given to two overall objectives:\n0\n\n0\n\nTo structure the Center\xe2\x80\x99s organization to efficiently and competently perform our missions, taking\ninto account recent decisions on major programs and initiatives from the previous year\xe2\x80\x99s strategic\nplan\nTo update the Center\xe2\x80\x99s strategic plan on the basis of the new organization and missions\n\nPIanning Process\nThe strategic planning process consisted of the\nfollowing steps:\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nReorganizing the Center to meet several new\nthrusts and realignments resulting from prior\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 planning, and to meet the needldesire\nto restructure the aeronautics program\nEstablishing goals and objectives consistent\nwith those of NASA and the Headquarters\nprogram offices\nEstablishing a work breakdown structure\nDeveloping planning options based on the\ncurrent environment\nFormulating a strategic plan that integrates\nthe selected planning options\nImplementing the plan, including allocating\npersonnel and other resources\n\nThe following sections describe the Lewis goals and objectives, the overall work breakdown structure,\nand the individual directorate plans, including their goals and objectives, missions, work breakdown\nstructures, and significant actions and accomplishments. The last section summarizes key plans and\naccomplishments of a Centerwide nature.\n\nGoals and Objectives\nThe goals and objectives for Lewis were derived from the NASA and Headquarters program office goals\nand objectives. In like manner, goals and objectives from the Agency and the Center were used by the\nvarious directorates and their subordinate organizations in formulating their own goals and objectives.\nThese are described in the individual directorate plans that follow. Similarly, these goals and objectives\nwere cascaded down to the working levels to involve the individual employee in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s overall plans. All\nyears are fiscal years.\n\n3\n\nORIGINAL PAGE 1\ns\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nLewis Goals and Objectives\nThe Lewis Environment\nGoals\n\nTo provide a creative environment and the best of facilities,\nsupport services, and management support for our work force so\nthat it can perform with excellence the Center\xe2\x80\x99s research,\ndevelopment, mission, and operational responsibilities.

The\nfollowing directorate plans were generated by\nthe members of the new directorate\norgan izat ion s.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n?\nAERONAUTICS\nDIRECTORATE\n\nAEROSPACE\nTECHNOLOGY\nDIRECTORATE\n\nOWLGENAL PAGE I\nS\nOF POOR QUALrrV\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nSPACE FLIGHT\nSYSTEMS\nDIRECTORATE\n\nSPACE STATION\nSYSTEMS\nDIRECTORATE\n\nENGINEERING AND\nTECHNICAL SERVICES\nDIRECTORATE\n\nADMINISTRATION AND\nCOMPUTER SERVICES\nDIRECTORATE\n\nOFFICE\n\nCOMPTROLLER\nP\n\nI\n[\n\nlNSTR"MlNTLTl0N AND\nCONTROL TECHNOLOO"\nOFFICE\nH\n\nc\n\nw.np.r\n\nmm\n\n1\n\nI\n\n(i\n\nI\nPLUM BROOK\nMANAGEMENT\nOFFICE\nR 1 MDCh\n\n1003\n\nI\n\nI .\n\nI ,\n\nThe Lewis Research Center organization\n\n8\n\nAnderron\n\nWork Breakdown Structure\nThe work breakdown structure (WBS), a hierarchical arrangement of planning elements, provides the\ngeneral framework for the strategic planning activity. At the uppermost tier of the hierarchy the WBS was\ndivided along current directorate organizational lines. Each directorate then prepared a WBS, which for\nthe research directorates followed program lines and for the support directorates followed organizational\nlines. These WBS\xe2\x80\x99s followed a format consistent with the present resources-accounting system to\nfacilitate tabulation of personnel and funding. In the individual directorate strategic plans that follow, at\nleast the first two tiers of the WBS are described.\n\nOffice of Research and Technology Assessment\nMission\nThe Office of Research and Technology Assessment will strengthen basic research at Lewis and ensure\nthat our aeronautics and space programs receive the maximum benefit from basic research activities\nhere, at universities, and within industrial organizations. The Office will assist in evaluating, and\nselecting directions for, future focused research and technology programs. The Office is organized into\nthree groups that are responsible for monitoring in-house research, for coordinating university programs,\nand for evaluating Lewis and industry efforts in aeronautics and space. The development of visionary\nprograms with high payoff is the ultimate goal.\n\nResearch and\nTechnology\nAssessment\n\nScientist\n\nUniversity\nAffairs\n\nTechnology\nAssessment\n\nOffice of Research and Technology Assessment\nwork breakdown structure\n\n9\n\nStrategic Objectives and Actions Planned\nOffice of the Chief Scientist\n\nThe Office of the Chief Scientist has been performing certain critical duties very effectively for some\nyears and plans to continue these efforts in 1985. These duties include managing and coordinating the\nbasic research carried out under the Fund for Independent Research, as well as that supported by the\nDirector\xe2\x80\x99s Discretionary Fund. Both have been quite successful in supporting selected new research\nprojects, with the Director\xe2\x80\x99s fund particularly aimed at the development of innovative ideas. Efforts\nselected by the Lewis Research Advisory Board will be supported until the idea has been proven and\nsupport becomes available from regular sources. Overall responsibility for the senior management\nresearch reviews also resides in this Office. To help evaluate in-house Lewis discipline efforts, peer\nreviews are planned and managed by the Chief Scientist. These reviews will result in the same rigorous\nstandards that are currently applied to university and contract programs. The first peer review, of\ncombustion fundamentals in September 1984, appears to have been quite successful. Structural\ndynamics will be reviewed in March 1985 and electrochemistry fundamentals later in the year. Results\nfrom these peer reviews will be factored into next year\xe2\x80\x99s strategic planning activity.\nAttached to this Office is a group of outstanding individual researchers whose efforts at present are\ntotally analytical. Plans are being formulated for the creation of a coordinated network of outstanding\nexperimental researchers who will perform some critical experimental work. Experimental work often\nleads into new areas and may also provide critical data to help the analyst in explaining an existing\nproblem. The members of these groups will be available for consultation with other Lewis organizations\nand will lend their expertise to the technology assessment process as required.\n\n10\n\nOffice of University Affairs\n\nThe Office of University Affairs is new. Its plans include consolidating and centralizing the coordination\nof Lewis-university interactions. University relations will be managed from this Office in such a way as to\nimprove bi-directional communications between the various university segments and Lewis management,\nresearch, and project staff. Any manner in which university administrations, departments, faculties, and\nstudents can help Lewis in its programs will be investigated and supported, as appropriate. The most\nimportant action the Office will undertake is the establishment and nurturing of contacts between\nuniversity faculty researchers and Lewis researchers. Additionally, specific measures will be taken to\ncultivate the graduate student population working on research grants both to enhance the recruitment\npool and to develop an improved network among these young researchers. A university programs\nmanagement information system will be developed for use Centerwide and to structure liaison activities\nwith procurement, recruitment, and training. In all relations with the university community, consideration\nwill be given to enhancing their sense of partnership, which, in turn, will promote a strong community of\nadvocacy for the continuation and growth of Lewis programs.\nOffice of Technology Assessment\n\nThe Office of Technology Assessment is newly created, but for some time many have felt its need in\nLewis management\xe2\x80\x99s technical and policy decision making. The Office will coordinate inputs from Lewis\ntechnical staff (including our own \xe2\x80\x9cfellows\xe2\x80\x9d), university experts and industrial researchers, and any\norganization whose information would affect assessment of the subject area. Outside experts will be\nbrought to Lewis when required. A procedure i s being formulated for selecting the areas to be assessed,\nand several assessments are planned for 1985. This Office will also assist in identifying discipline\nexperts at Lewis and will channel visitors and inquiries on technical matters to the appropriate Lewis\nexpert. It will sponsor research and technology briefings and special presentations to inform the staff of\nLewis accomplishments. An enlarged response to various aerospace industrial research and\ndevelopment programs will be implemented in 1985 in cooperation with NASA Headquarters Office of\nAeronautics and Space Technology and the Department of Defense.\n\n11\n\nAeropropulsion\nprcgrarn\n\nF\nl\nSupporting\n\nplanning\n\nI\n\nCritical\ndisciplines\n\nFocused\npropulsion\n\nfacilities\n\nAeronautics Directorate work breakdown structure\n\nAeronautics Directorate\nMission\n\nThe Aeronautics Directorate, as restructured and redirected, consolidates and strengthens the key\ndisciplinary \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding blocks\xe2\x80\x9d for future advances in aeropropulsion; provides a focus for discipline,\ncomponent, and system research; strengthens the roles and responsibilities for major facilities and\nexperiments; and emphasizes both program planning and mission analysis as catalysts for generating\nideas and identifying directions.\nThe mission of the Aeronautics Directorate is to establish aeropropulsion technology that contributes\nsignificantly to the continuing preeminence of the U.S. civil and military aircraft industry. The Directorate\nis responsible (1) for significantly advancing research in internal computational fluid mechanics and\ninstrumentation and controls; (2) for achieving major propulsion technology advances in\ninterdisciplinary-, propulsion-, and vehicle-focused programs; (3) for enhancing the capabilities of\nexisting aeropropulsion experimental facilities and developing new facilities; and (4) for identifying and\nevaluating innovative propulsion concepts. The Directorate also supports other Lewis directorates, other\ncenters, and other agencies in applying aeropropulsion-related technology and ensuring effective and\ntimely transfer of this technology to appropriate elements of U.S. industry.\nStrategic Objectives and Actions Planned\nDirectorate Level\n\nThe Aeronautics Directorate, before establishing its strategic objectives for the next 5 years, established\nguidelines for strategic planning. These guidelines assume a constant level of civil service staffing,\nmoderate funding growth in institutional support, significant (at least 50 percent) funding growth in the\ntotal aeronautics budget, which includes the significant out-year funding increases required by the\nAdvanced Turboprop Project and the Altitude Wind Tunnel, and major involvement of both staff and\nfacilities in all future programs.\nThe Directorate program, shown in the work breakdown structure, emphasizes the development of\ninterdisciplinary-, propulsion-, and vehicle-focused research and technology and, to that end, requires\nadvanced planning, the support of certain critical disciplines, and aeropropulsion facilities.\n\n12\n\nAdvanced Planning\n\nThe Advanced Planning and Analysis Office will assess the\nperformance potentials of advanced and unconventional\npropulsion and aircraft systems. It will also identify and analyze\nnew propulsion concepts and their integration, which could\nenable new vehicle systems. The Office will be key to developing\nthe new ideas, concepts, and systems that will set the direction\nfor aeropropulsion programs. It i s planned, for example, t o\nevaluate the turbine bypass engine in a variety of aircraft\napplications and to assess the benefits and technology needs of\nnon-heat-propulsion systems such as microwave-beam-powered\nengines.\nTwelve-lobe mixer nozzle\n\nCritical Disciplines\n\nThe Instrumentation and Controls Technology Office combines\nand focuses key elements of ongoing programs and expands into\nrelated new areas. The Office will continue to develop and apply\nadvanced instrumentation. With the restructuring of the aeropropulsion program the Office\xe2\x80\x99s efforts are\nbeing expanded into instrument applications, high-temperature electronics research and development,\nadvanced control sensor technology, and the development of advanced control strategies. The focus of\nthe controls effort is to develop the technologies for \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d engines of the future. Examples of planned\nactions are the demonstration of fiber optic sensors for use in propulsion control systems and the\ndevelopment of minimally intrusive sensors for measuring temperature, strain, and heat flux on\npropulsion system components.\nThe Internal Fluid Mechanics Division consolidates all activities at Lewis related to internal\ncomputational fluid mechanics. The division develops computational methods, performs modeling, and\ndevelops and verifies codes. Key research in computational methods includes numerics, mesh\nconstruction, and algorithm development. The modeling area will be supported by fundamental research\nin fluid mechanics, combustion, kinetics, and heat transfer. The Division plans, for example, to establish\narchival benchmark data for modeling fundamental fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and combustion\nspecific to aeropropulsion. It will use these benchmark data to verify three-dimensional internal flow\ncodes over the range of aeropropulsion components and systems.\nAeropropulsion Facilities\n\nThe Altitude Wind Tunnel (AWT) Project Office is responsible\nfor program advocacy and an extensive in-house modeling\nprogram as well as the design and construction of this\nfacility. Modeling involves both physical models and\nsimulations.\nAWT is essential for the development of future\naeropropulsion systems and will provide a unique capability\nfor NASA and the nation. Specifically, the AWT will enable\nboth propulsion-airframe integration studies and adverseweather research (e.g., icing and heavy rain) that are not now\npossible because of facility limitations of size, speed, and\naltitude capabiI ity.\nAltitude Wind Tunne/\n\n13\n\n,\n\nThe typical role of research facility operations has been\nexpanded in the new organizational structure. The\nAeropropulsion Facilities and Experiments Division will\nmanage not only the major Lewis aeropropulsion facilities\nbut also the experiments conducted in these facilities.\nFacility managers will be responsible for assembling a team\nto accomplish all aspects of a test program.\nPropulsion-Focused Technology\n\nIncluded in propulsion-focused technology are small engines\nand high-thrust-to-weight engines. Small engines include the\nDepartment of Energy-funded automotive gas turbine, which\nis the Directorate\xe2\x80\x99s second highest priority, as well as rotary\nengines and small aircraft gas turbine engines. A new\n\nGulfstream G11 testmg propfan\n\nVehicle-Focused Propulsion Technology\n\nIncluded in vehicle-focused propulsion technology are subsonic transports, advanced rotorcraft,\nsupersonic aircraft, and hypersonic aircraft. In the subsonic transport category is the Advanced\nTurboprop Project, which has the highest priority in the Directorate. This project involves major in-house\nand contractual efforts to establish technology readiness for the next generation of fuel-efficient engines\nfor transport use in the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s. Current efforts in advanced rotorcraft are in convertible engine\ntechnology, integrated controls, and advanced transmissions.\nFor 1987 and beyond, the Directorate has identified three possible initiatives in vehicle-focused\ntechnology: convertible engines, supersonic short-takeoff-and-vertical-landing aircraft (STOVL), and\nhypersonic propulsion. The convertible engine initiative would include efforts in the X-wing, the folding\ntilt rotor, and subsonic verticallshort takeoff and landing. The supersonic STOVL initiative, also known as\npowered lift, would be a joint program with the Ames Research Center and would include cooperation\nwith the United Kingdom on vectored thrust and with Canada on an augmentorlejector. The hypersonic\npropulsion initiative would be a joint program with the Langley Research Center.\nInterdisciplinary-Focused Propulsion Technology\n\nI\n\nHigh-speed rotorcraft\n\nI\n\nI nterd i sc i pl i nary-focused propu I ion tech no1ogy i ncl udes i ci ng\ns\ntechnology, special projects, and hot-section durability. Icing\ntechnology, in addition to the icing research program, includes\nsubstantial support for the AWT modeling effort. Hot-section\ndurability, an effort in which the Aerospace Technology\nDirectorate has the lead, supplies a high percentage of the net\nresearch and development funding for key disciplinary\ntechnologies of materials, structures, instrumentation and\nsensors, and internal computational fluid mechanics. Because\nfunding for the current hot-section technology program, HOST,\nwill expire in 1988, a new initiative will be advocated for future\nyears as a means of continuing funding for these key disciplinary\ntechnologies.\n\n14\n\nAerospace Technology Directorate\nlechnolcgy\nprqram\n\nMission\n\n7\nThe Aerospace Technology Directorate\xe2\x80\x99s mission is\n(1) to provide the technology for aeropropulsion and\nexperiments\nspace needs in space power, space propulsion,\naerospace materials, and aerospace structures, (2) to\ndefine, develop, and conduct in-space experiments in\nbasic science, materials, fluids, and space propulsion\nand power technology development, and (3) to manage\nsynergistic terrestrial energy projects for the\nAerospace Technology Directorate work breakdown\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) and the Agency for\nstructure\nInternational Development (AID) in order to fulfill\ncurrent commitments. In fulfilling its mission the\nDirectorate must work closely wish the other program directorates not only as a developer of technology,\nbut also by providing critical support to their programs as required.\n\nStrategic Objectives and Actions Planned\nDirectorate Level\n\nThis update of the Lewis strategic plan reaffirms and builds upon previous objectives in the major\ncategories shown in the work breakdown structure. The recent reorganization, which consolidates space\npower and propulsion technology, space experiments, and the broadly applicable disciplines of materials\nand structures in this Directorate, grew from the successes achieved to date by the Center in meeting its\nstrategic objectives and from a recognition that in technology a high degree of synergism exists across\nthe major fields of interest to Lewis. The overall Directorate objectives are (1) to maintain and further\ndevelop Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 research and technology lead as a center of excellence in space power, space\npropulsion, and aeropropulsion materials and structures and to become a center of excellence for\nmicrogravity science; (2) to expand Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 role in science and technology experiments in space; (3) to\nsuccessfully fulfill all commitments to other directorates; and (4) to continue meeting energy program\ncommitments to DOE and AID.\nDirectorate funding is expected to increase over the next few years. However, to achieve its objectives,\nthe Directorate will have to maintain strong program advocacy, increase its market share of research and\ndevelopment funds, and broaden its constituency beyond the Office of Aeronautics and Space\nTechnology (OAST) to the Office of Space Science and Applications, the Office of Space Flight, and the\nDepartment of Defense. The development of joint programs between OAST and others will be vigorously\npursued as appropriate. Personnel working on Directorate programs include NASA civil service\nemployees, Army employees, support service contractors, and university consortium staff. The\nDirectorate civil service level will remain essentially constant. Increasing staffing needs for growing\nareas (e.g., space station propulsion and space experiments) will be satisfied through internal\nrebalancing, more support service contractors, and university consortium augmentation.\n\n15\n\nA eropropulsion\n\nA Directorate goal is to maintain and develop a center of\nexcellence in materials, structures, and life prediction so as\nto meet future technology needs and to support systems\nprojects in collaboration with the Aeronautics Directorate. In\nthe restructuring of the aeronautics program, it was\nrecognized that these disciplines are as critical to aircraft\nengines as they are to space propulsion and power systems.\nA strong program will continue in advanced materials and\nprocesses, structural mechanics and dynamics analysis, and\nlife prediction. Augmenting the base research and\ntechnology efforts are interdisciplinary programs in turbine\nHigh-temperature fatigue and structures laboratory\nengine hot-section technology (HOST) and ceramics for\nadvanced turbine engines. Currently being given midcourse\ncorrections, HOST will form the basis for Lewis achieving a\npremier posture in computational structural mechanics,\nreaching into the problems of small engines with steeper\nthermal gradients and ceramic components. Structural\nceramics are of major importance to the competitiveness of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 aircraft industry. Raising\nceramics funding to the levels needed to achieve technology readiness will be strongly advocated.\nAnother important initiative is composite materials for engines. The Directorate will continue to provide\nstrong support to the Advanced Turboprop and Altitude Wind Tunnel Projects and to other priority\naeronautics programs like Small Engine Technology.\n\nI\n\nSpace Power\n\nA Directorate goal is to maintain Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 role as lead center and center of excellence for space power\nresearch and technology: in photovoltaics, electrochemistry, thermal and power management, power\ndistribution, and nuclearlsolar dynamic power systems, including supporting materials, structures, and\nlife prediction disciplines and studies. Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 role will continue to grow because power is now\nrecognized as a major technology issue for the space station and its evolution, for geostationary Earthorbiting spacecraft, and for military systems. The importance of the nuclear dynamic option is growing\nand Lewis is expecting to play an important role. Initiatives being advocated include advanced solar\ndynamic systems, free-piston Stirling research and technology, \xe2\x80\x9csatellite 2000\xe2\x80\x9d bus technology, and\nelectrodynamic tether. Growth is expected in power and electronic materials research.\nSpace Propulsion\n\nA Directorate goal is to maintain Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 role as lead center\nand center of excellence for space propulsion research and\ntechnology for Earth-to-orbit, orbit-to-orbit, and auxiliary\npropulsion systems, including supporting materials,\nstructures, and life prediction disciplines and studies. It is\nanticipated that Lewis will continue to lead in orbit-transfervehicle (OTV) engine technology. A research engine initiative\nis just beginning.\n\nReactor Stirling engine space power system\n\n16\n\n1\n\nORIGINPI!.

The arc jet is receiving more\nattention, and work continues on inert-gas ion\nthrusters and storable systems. To support\nthese continuing and expanding activities, an\naltitude capability has been added to the Rocket\nEngine Test Facility and modifications are being\nmade to tank 5 in the Electric Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The\nplanned space station will provide even greater opportunities. The Aerospace Technology Directorate is\nthe focal point for Lewis to take advantage of these new opportunities. There are two Directorate goals.\nThe first is to successfully advocate Lewis becoming a center of excellence for microgravity science\n(materials, combustion, and fluid physics) by 1986 in support of NASA\'s applications, commercialization,\nand space station programs. This would include maintaining and evolving a microgravity materials\nscience laboratory. The second goal is to implement and expand Lewis\' role in science and technology\nexperiments in space in support of NASA\'s applications, technology, and space station programs. Eight\nexperiments are currently funded, with six more on the threshold. In this area growth is limited only by\nimagination. For full vitality new ways of doing business will have to be developed. A modification to the\nLewis Zero-Gravity Facility, the space experiments laboratory, is being actively advocated for the 1987\nconstruct ion-of-faciI ities budget.\nEnergy\n\nThere are two Directorate goals. The first is to\ncontinue to meet all existing program\ncommitments to DOE and AID by more use of\nsuppor? service contractor personnel in the\nphotovoltaic, phosphoric acid fuel cell, wind, and\nStirling engine projects and to provide support to\nthe Automotive Gas Turbine Project. The second\ngoal is to begin or expand selected aeronautics\nand space technology programs from those energy\nprojects that are synergistic to Lewis\' interests\n(e.g., Stirling engine and ceramics).\n\nMicrogravity materials science laboratory\n\n17\n\nSpace Flight Systems Directorate\nMission\n\nThe Space Flight Systems Directorate is responsible for\nthe development and operational activities associated\nwith the Center\xe2\x80\x99s spaceflight program assignments. The\nDirectorate is conducting research and development in\ntwo major program areas: space transportation and\nspace communications. The Directorate also provides\nreliability and quality assurance for these programs as\nwell as for other major system development programs\nat the Center.\n\nI\n\n-\n\n-\n\nI\nAtlas-Centaur\n\nI\n\n- Basic research\n\n-\n\nAtlas-H\n\nI\nI\n\n- Applied technology\n\n-\n\nShuttle-Centaur\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nr02-7\n\nI Lewis\nI\nI programs I\n\n- Advanced\n\n-\n\nCommunications\nTechnology\nSatellite\nSystems analysis\nTechnology\n\nSpace Flight Systems Directorate work breakdown\nstructure\n\nStrategic Objectives and Actions Planned\nSpace Transportation Program\n\nSince 1962, Lewis has been responsible for the development of the Centaur upper stage and has\nmanaged 100 launches, including 60 Atlas-Centaurs. Since 1981, the Space Flight Systems Directorate\nhas also provided certain acquisition and technical consultation and management support to the Air\nForce for five Atlas-H boosters. The Directorate will continue its efforts to provide completely reliable\nlaunch vehicles through the duration of these programs. With the advent of the space shuttle and plans\nto commercialize the Atlas-Centaur, the final Lewis-managed launch of Atlas-Centaur (AC-68) is\nscheduled for 1987. It is anticipated that Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 commitment to the Air Force to procure and manage\nAtlas-H launch vehicles will end in 1986. Over the next 2 years the Lewis team will ensure the orderly\nshutdown of production of Atlas-Centaur and Atlas-H launch vehicles and the disposal of Government\nequipment (tooling, manufacturing equipment, machines, etc).\nA major new space transportation program, the development of\nCentaur as an upper stage for the space shuttle, was begun in\n1982. During 1983, the base program established at the end of\n1982 was expanded to include additional missions. In October\n1983, a $253 million contract was awarded to General Dynamics\nCorporation for the design, development, and production of two\nCentaur vehicles, modified for use with the shuttle, to support the\nNASA Galileo (Jupiter) and International Solar Polar missions in\n1986.\n\nLaunch of AC-35-24\n\n18\n\nIn the near term the Directorate\xe2\x80\x99s strategic plan calls for\nsuccessfully accomplishing the base program plus future\naugmentations, as appropriate.\nFor the long term the Directorate staff and capabilities will be\nmaintained as required. Upon completion of the initial Centaur-inshuttle development activities in 1986, it is envisioned that there\nwill be a gradual transition from development activities to\nmission integration and operations.\n\nArtlst\xe2\x80\x99s concept of shuttle-Centaur\n\nSpace Communications Program\n\nIn 1979, Lewis was designated the lead center for research and development in space communications.\nSince then, Lewis has continued to build a broad-based, integrated communications program of studies,\nbasic research, applied high-risk technology (base program), and flight experimentation where required\n(flight programs).\nThe base program of the Space Communications Division is\ndeveloping technology usable in multiple-frequency bands to\nsupport a wide range of future communications systems for NASA,\nother Government agencies, and U.S. industry. In 1984, significant\nprogress was made in all of these areas. As a result the integrated\nbase program is sure to be strengthened. A contract was signed on\nAugust 10, 1984, with RCA Astro Electronics, Inc., for the\ndevelopment of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite\n(ACTS) system, embodying advanced multiple-beam antennas,\nonboard switching and processing, and other advanced\ntechnologies. A separate ACTS Project Office was established\nwithin the Directorate to manage the ACTS system development and\noperations.\nStrategic objectives of the pirectorate are to promote a stable and\nviable NASA advanced communications program and to stengthen\nLewis\xe2\x80\x99 role as the lead center in space communications research\nand development.\n\nAdvanced Communications Technology\nSatellite\n\n19\n\nThe following specific actions were planned for the next 2 years:\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nTo assist Headquarters in expanding and detailing the longterm NASA program plan\nTo continue to advocate for the resources necessary to enable\nprogram growth in selected areas and overall program stability\nand effectiveness\nTo continue to raise the quality of the staff and improve the\nskill mix through selective hiring\nTo continue ACTS design, development, and fabrication\nTo define appropriate advanced flight programs as follow-ons\nto ACTS\n\nI\n\ninterim antenna test laboratory\n\nFor the long term it is planned\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nTo continue program advocacy and development in advanced communications elements and systems\nTo maintain a broad-based, integrated communications program\nTo continue development to the launch of ACTS (1989) and to begin ACTS experiments (through 1991)\n\nPotential augmentations to the base program may include\n0\n0\n0\n\nUndertaking selective basic research applicable to a second-generation (or expanded) space station\nDeveloping a center of excellence in solid-state microelectronics and microwave systems\nSecuring additional near-term resources to accelerate the pace of applied technology\nReliability and Quality Assurance\n\nDuring 1984, the Reliability and Quality Assurance Office\n(R&QAO) concentrated on supporting the larger, more complex\nprograms at Lewis such as launch vehicles, ACTS, and space\nstation. All personnel assignments within R&QAO have been\nmade to support these programs. Their support has been very\ndemanding on the staff, especially in the areas of electronic\nparts, mate rials, e I ec t ron ic pac kag i ng , and contract orlve ndor\nsurveys. The staff has grown by 20 percent and the new\npersonnel have been trained and are making positive\ncontributions in support of these programs. The key objectives\nwill be to continue to upgrade the staff, both in number and\ncapability, in order to better support the Center\xe2\x80\x99s large, complex\nspace programs.\n\nReliability testing of so/id-state devices\n\n20\n\nORiGfNAL PAGE E\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nSpace station\nprqram\n\nSpace Station Systems Directorate\nProgram,\nmanagement\n\nMission\n\nThe mission of the Space Station Systems Directorate is\nto manage and coordinate all of the work performed at\nLewis in support of the Space Station Program. This\nincludes the work performed as lead center for power for\nthe initial-operating-capability(IOC) space station, which\ninvolves defining and developing the power system. It also\nincludes supporting roles in auxiliary propulsion and other\ndisciplines and in the use and evolution of the space\nstation.\n\npropulrlan\nM?Chaniwland thermal\n\nSpace Station Systems Directorate work breakdown\nstructure\n\nStrategic Objectives and Actions Planned\n\nThe Space Stations Systems Directorate was organized when Lewis was assigned as lead center for the\npower system for the IOC space station and as supporting center for auxiliary propulsion and other\ntechnology efforts. The Directorate will meet all program and technical requirements associated with\nthese roles in order to ensure our continued major responsibility for space station power, to maintain our\nleadership in space power, and to enhance our role in propulsion.\nIt is anticipated that the permanent full-time complement of the Directorate, currently 94, will be 135 by\nthe end of 1985.\nDefinition Phase\nPower\n\nThe Directorate will manage two major contracts for tradeoff studies, systems engineering, and\npreliminary design of the power system for the IOC space station and platforms. The contractors will\nalso establish the interfaces between the power system and\nother space station systems managed by other NASA\ncenters (JSC, MSFC, and GSFC). They will also perform the\nwork necessary to integrate the power system with the\nspace station. Finally they will focus on other factors such\nas performance, reliability, maintainability, and cost, which\nis of great importance. Systems engineering and integration\n(SE&I) work will be performed by Lewis to augment and\nguide the contracted effort.\nThe objective is to define the most capable power system\nfor the IOC space station and platforms within cost and\nother constraints. A successful definition phase is needed to\nensure Lewis\' continuing role in space station power.\n\nPower system test\n\n21\n\nPropulsion\n\nThe Directorate will support Marshall Space Flight Center in its lead role in propulsion for the IOC space\nstation. This support will include in-house SE&I effort. Sufficient Lewis participation in the definition\nphase will be sought to bring about a better recognition and acceptance of Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 capabilities and\nexpertise in propulsion and fluid management for space station applications.\nThe strategic objectives of this support are to ensure that Lewis technologies are adequately assessed\nfor their potential benefits to the Space Station Program and to help focus the advanced development\nprogram supported by the Space Station Program Office and the OAST Focused-Technology Program.\nEvolution and Growth\n\nThe Directorate will perform studies to define growth paths for power and propulsion systems for the\nspace station, including the orbital transfer vehicle (OTV), and to assess the merits of advanced\ntechnology options. This effort will ensure that growth implications are factored into IOC designs.\nThe strategic objectives of this effort are to maintain Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 role as lead center in power for the space\nstation and as a center of excellence in space power as well as to develop Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 roles in power and\npropulsion technology and hardware for the evolutionary space station.\nAdvanced Development\nPower\n\nThe Directorate manages a NASA-wide program in\nadvanced power system development. The objective is to\nbring to technical readiness power system technology\noptions for the IOC space station. This program includes\nwork performed by other NASA centers (MSFC, JSC, and\nJPL), work related to prototype hardware, and the power\nsystem work under the OAST Focused-Technology\nProgram. The technologies covered under advanced\ndevelopment include solar arrays, regenerative fuel cells,\nsolar dynamic systems, power management and\ndistribution, and those mechanical and thermal\ntechnologies that support the power system. Results will\nbe incorporated in the contractors\xe2\x80\x99 definition phase. An\nimportant additional effort is to define new facilities or\naugmentation of present facilities that may be needed to\ndemonstrate technical readiness and to support the\ndesign and development phase.\n\n22\n\nOAST-1 wing\n\n'
