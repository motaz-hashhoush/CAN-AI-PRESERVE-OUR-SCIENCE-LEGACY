b'SPACE BASED OTV SERVICING*\n\nJ. Greg McAllister and Larry Redd\nMartin Marietta Aerospace\n\nSpace based servicing of an Orbit Transfer Vehicle (OTV) has been outlined\nin sufficient detail to arrive at OTV and support system servicing requirements.\nNeeded space station facilities and their functional requirements have been\nidentified. The impact of logistics and space servicable design on the OTV design\nis detailed.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe President\'s proposed Space Station (SS) will provide an excellent base\nfrom which to operate a reusable space based Orbit Transfer Vehicle (OTV).\nUsing the SS as a launch and refueling platform will allow the decoupling of the\nSpace Transportation System (sTS) earth to low earth orbit (LEO) and the OTV LEO to\ngeosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) legs of payload delivery to GEO. The shuttle will\nno longer be forced to launch in a window dictated by the payload delivery, but\nrather on a periodic basis which would allow optimization of ground resources for\nroutine flow. The burden of meeting the launch window then falls upon the SS/OTV\nsystem. This implies the need for a highly dependable OTV and OTV support system\nif the launch windows are to be reliably met.\nThe OTV support system will in part consist of SS facilities capable of\ndoing routine maintenance and certain contingency repair procedures. It will need\nan efficient logistics function, as well, to provide needed spares and consumables\nin a cost effective, timely manner. Implied by this is a highly developed health\nmonitoring system for the OTV and its subsystems. This system must be capable of\ndiagnosing items in need of attention early enough so that the necessary\npreventative action can be scheduled and lengthy downtimes avoided. All this is\nmade very challenging by the fact that the SS will be able to provide only very\nlimited manned support due to the restricted number of men available, the extreme\ndifficulty of working in the space environment, and the demands of other SS\nactivities.\nGROUND RULES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nSince none of the hardware actually exists, it is necessary to make a few\nassumptions and establish sensible ground rules to allow the task to proceed.\nThese are shown in Table 1 and will be briefly discussed below. Since the\nobjective of the present study is to identify engine impacts with regard to\nservicing, detailed design of the SS support facilities, etc., won\'t be attempted.\nAlso, assumptions which ease the task of determining representative OTV design and\nsubsequent engine impacts will be made fully realizing that they may not be real.\n\n* This work was performed under Contract No. 127985 with Pratt and Whitney\nAircraft, West Palm Beach, Florida\n\nPrecediag pagr Yank\n\nFor instance, all refueling operations are assumed to be performed on the SS\ninstead of at a remote propellant farm. Operationally, the only impact is to the\ntimeline. The operations to be performed remain similar. The major assumptions\nshow up in Table 1 while many of the smaller assumptions will be noted in the text,\nas appropriate\n\n.\n\nThe present study ground rules are: the use of the space station as the OTV\nbase, STS shuttle as the launch vehicle, manrating of the OTV, L 0 2 / ~ ~ 2\npropellants, and the use of an aerobrake with a low lift to drag ratio. From a\nservicing standpoint, L02/LH2 propellants, manrating, and the aerobrake present\nthe greatest drivers. While the aerobrake itself may not need much servicing, a\nfixed aerobrake restricts OTV maneuvering about the SS, drives hangar design, and\ncomplicates engine servicing. Manrating implies a high degree of\nreliability/redundancy which in turn impacts the integrity of servicing\noperat ions. L O ~ / L H ~\npropellants have a major impact on the propellant storage\nand transfer systems and to a lesser extent impacts the engine servicing\nrequirements. Principally, the latter will be concerned only with engine changeout\nimplications and the required health monitoring system and its requirements.\nAs mentioned above, all space based OTV servicing is assumed to be at the SS\nand means to maneuver the OTV about the SS are provided. Specifically,\nthe hangar and refueling depot are assumed attached and controlled from a permanent\nOTV control station at the SS. The OTV control station will control all OTV\nrelated operations: data-handling, refueling, line of sight (LOS) proximity\noperations, maintenance scheduling and procedures (except extra-vehicular activity\n(EVA)), and SS inventory control. The OTV is assumed to be under ground control\nfor the LEO-GEO-LEO phase of the delivery missions. Both the baseline Rev 6\nmission model and the SS Mission Model (ref. 1 Vol. 3) indicate an OTV launch\nfrequency of one every two weeks to one month. Therefore, a two week turnaround\nwill be used as the groundrule.\nOTV MISSION FLOW\nGiven the above assumptions and ground rules, the general OTV servicing flow\ncan be sketched as shown in Table 2. From this list of operations, those pertinant\nto engine and OTV servicing are further broken out so that an operational and\nfunctional analysis can be performed which will reveal the SS facilities needs and\nthe engine servicing impacts. These will be used as a baseline against which\nalternate servicing concepts will be explored/evaluated.\nAlso, contingency operations such as unscheduled maintenance will be discussed\nrelative to the impact on the baseline functional flow.\n\nA "top down" approach was first used to divide up the nominal two week\nturnaround so that the maximum available time to do tasks could be delineated.\nNext, specific individual tasks were considered "bottom up1\' in that actual times\nand equipment needed to perform comparable tasks on the ground were determined. In\nthis fashion, areas of further research were identified. For the purposes of this\nstudy, the shorter of the two times were used to assemble the timelines shown.\nIncluded with the operational analysis are columns indicating facilities needs, and\nintra-vehicular activity (IVA), EVA and delta time.\n\nTables 3 and 4 indicate tasks, facilities, and time data for the baseline\nOTV turnaround. Table 2 presents a top level OTV servicing flow while T a b l e s 3 and\n4 break out OTV servicing and engine servicing in further detail, respectiveby,\nComplete mission turnaround is shown to take approximately 10 days. This is driven\nprimarily by the LEO-GEO-LEO time and the OTV post mission processing.\nThe following discussion will cover the OTV mission flow. The \'\\genericaQ i3TV\nmission is anticipated to begin early with the mission planning activities and\nother operations by the payload program. The SS begins its preparations 2 co 3\ndays before the payload is delivered by the STS. The payload is delivered a\nnominal one week early principally at the convenience of the shuttle and i s stored\non-board the SS awaiting pre-mission processing. Facilities for handling the\npayload are presumed available. Their exact manifestation is immaterial, b i ~ t\nshould include means of mechanically restraining the payload, providing dorlnant:\npower, data handling, and thermal protection.\n\nA day before the mission the payload is moved into the servicing hangar for\nfinal check-out operations. No EVA is anticipated, but could be used if t h e\npayload had non-standard interfaces or required some minor contingency repair,\nFor normal operations all pre-mission payload check-out operations shall be handled\nremotely. The four hours of check-out time are primarily to allow for P/L\noperations which may be more economically performed on the SS than on the %round,\nFor example, payloads could be launched without fluids to relieve designing for\nlaunch loads.\nFollowing successful payload check-out, the OTV will be moved to the\nservicing hangar for mating with the payload. A final health check will be made o f\nthe OTV and the mission parameters will be loaded into the OTV main computer, The\nOTV to payload interface (I/F) is assumed to be primarily mechanical with a minimal\nelectrical I/F provided. The electrical I/F would be standardized as well. as she\nmechanical I/F. If non-standard I/F\'S were used, the timeline would need to he\nmodified to allow for OTV I/F modification, No fluid I/F% are anticipated, Two\nP/L interfaces are implied here: one for the OTV and one for the STS. Once m a t e d\nand the I/F% verified, the OTV and payload will be moved to the OTV refueling area,\nRefueling is performed as the last major operation in the pre-liiunch flow to\navoid bringing a fully loaded OTV into the hangar and to minimize boil--off, This\nimplies a refueling area capable of accommodating the OTV, aerobrake, sind p a y l o a d ,\nThe OTV is docked and refueled on the aft end. A fixed aerobrake will complicate\nthe refueling area design. Presumably, a door will be provided in the aerobrake to\nallow the fluid umbilicals access to the OTV fluid interfaces. The refuehiqg\noperation itself is the subject of much debate and is simplified here i n t o a t a ? k\nchilldown operation followed by the bulk fluid transfer. Simultaneous fluid\ntransfer is assumed. Non-hypergolic fluids and "no leak" quick-disconreects (QD")\nshould allow this. Also, reaction control system (RCS) propellants and pressurants\nare resupplied in parallel with the main propellants. Pressurant needs should be\nminimized as much as possible due to the inordinate costs of resuppling pressurancs,\nFollowing resupply, a final OTV checkout can be performed (gimbal a r t u a t c r s ,\npressure checks, etc). The OTV and payload are then disconnected from the\nrefueling area and deployed from the SS. The timeline shown assumes that the SS\nremote manipulator system (RMS) releases the OTV and payload combination w i t h a\nsmall delta-V relative to the SS. The OTV uses a "smalla\'RCS burn to give\n\n~ P d l t i o r ~ adelta-V (about 3 fps) allowing swifter OTV and SS separation, At a safe\nP\n:estaae. from the SS the OTV control is passed to the ground and the delivery\naission begins, An orbital maneuvering vehicle ( O W ) could be used to accomplish\n- ~c same t h ~ n g .\n\nSpace Station control resumes following the return of the OTV to a safe area\nHere, OTV safing is performed. This may be comprised of\nventing the OTV propellant residuals. However, this timeline assumes that the cost\ns f propellarsts is of sufficient importance to warrant recovery. Safing would then\no-stai~~\nprir~arily,deactivation of the main engines (and the RCS if an OMV is used\ntc recover the OTV), The OTV is returned to the SS following safing either by the\nC 7 V XGS or an OMV.\nThe OTV is berthed at the refueling area.\ni * _ c k i n tOS OF; the SS,\n\nI f ssfing were to entail venting of propellants, this may have a major\n,,,pats. on the OTV, Non propulsive vents must be provided with the appropriate\n,-,\ntv.Tx~ing a n a controls. Venting through the engines would be possible but could\n;-pose\nbndesirable characteristics on the engine. Additionally, the resulting\n_s-,sr\nwould need to be accounted for. An OMV would not be able to do this as the\n3\n% wocl!.d lrkely be mated to the aft end of the OTV (so its thrust can act through\nrl-e CTV-p/L center of mass).\nl\n\nPost mission processing is essentially the reverse of the pre-mission flow,\nare removed after docking at the refueling area, Liquid\np f o 9 e i i a ~ ~ t s returned to the SS cryogen tanks and gaseous propellants are\nare\n,,4~;-.xcd f9-z use by the SS.

In addition, the ground\n1--3:e2sirag of mission data will perform an optimization of servicing tasks and\ne : u r n a t r l table detailing the exact operations to be performed, An\niie\n~ - , c - ~ ~ r i a a t i , ~ only possible now because both routine, (every missionb and\nis n\n.. ~ ~ t ? : : g e n c y\noperations will be interwoven to effect the optimization. This\n?>~roxr-azLion\nappears in Table 2 made up of the scheduled maintenance tasks from\n"dS~?s\n\nand 4 .\n\nWhile the OTV is still berthed at the refueling area, a propulsion system\ncheck will be performed. This check will be in support of ground analysis of\nflight data to determine items in need of maintenance and to execute tests design2d\nto isolate any anomalies detected in the flight data, The objective of this\ncheckout is to drive out any failures which can be remedied in the BTV maintenance\nto follow. Also, tests which require pressurants will need to be perforra~ed hereIf the OTV was equipped with removable tanks, the tank operations would be\nperformed in this area. However, removable tanks are not currently envisianod,\nAll maintenance operations will be performed in the servicing hangar after\nthe schedule has been returned. The first operation will be an overall. LITd visual\ninspection. This could be done EVA, but will likely be done with a closed circuit\nTV (CCTV) and monitor. In this case, sufficient mobility must be given to the CCTV\nto allow it to reach all areas of the OTV. Most likely, only specific areas will\nroutinely be inspected such as the engine nozzles, aerobrake, and OTV e c e e r i o r CCTV movement could then proceed in a pre- programmed manner and the crew woubd\nonly override to inspect questionable areas.\nIt is anticipated that the servicing hangar will provide for checko~e\numbilicals more extensive than those provided at the refueling area so thar.\nspecific tests can be run on the avionics. All umbilical actuation will be\nautomated to avoid EVA costs. EVA is anticipated only for non-routine 1nod1~3e\nchange out operations, non-routine inspection, and other infrequently performed\noperations where it won\'t be cost effective to automate. In any case, after\ncheckout umbilicals are attached the avionics will be checked via checkout s o f t ~ a r e\nand equipment carried for this purpose. Any anomalies will be noted and f a c t o r e d\ninto the maintenance schedule relayed from the ground. Any EVA operations would be\nperformed following schedule finalization. EVA module changeout would be performed\non all items so identified in the preceding checks. This assumes that the propier\nmodules are already on board the SS and the modules were designed for EVA\nreplacement. Both of these assumptions will be discussed more completely later,\nNo modules have yet been identified which will require changeout after e v e r y\nmission. If this were the case, this would likely be accomplished roboftically\nusing only one IVA crew man; once again, to avoid EVA costs. A candidate l i s t of\nEVA replaceable modules is shown in Table 5. This table includes esthmatcti timas\nand anticipated interfaces. Since RCS modules may involve fluid disconnects, t w s\noperations are shown to illustrate the differences. The fluid QD\'s lengthen t h e\ntime due to the additional effort required to assure the crew\'s safety\n(installation of spill containment shrouds and check out following installat~on),\nTwo major contingency operations identified are engine removal (waic:h c o u i d\nalso be routine) and aerobrake repair. Aerobrake repair is included at this point\nas a possibility. It is too early to say exactly what aerobrake repair implies or\nwhat type of failure it may suffer. Holes could be repaired either by parching or\npanel replacement. Aerobrake removal to ease servicing would be desirable but\nisn\'t a contingency operation. This would be included in overall processtng f i o t ~\nnear the end of pre-mission processing and the beginning of post mission processing,\nENGINE SERVICING\nSeveral levels of engine maintenance are identified as detailed an Cable\nTwo types of scheduled maintenance are shown, operations performed after si7ery\nflight and those performed every 10 missions.

The EVA crewmen are expected to replace an engine in four\nSS hangar, This short time is a goal which makes efficient DTV\npossibility. Two concepts for the engine-BTV interface are shcwn in\n2 , Concepts of this nature will be required. It will be necessary\nthe OTV-engine interface as much as possible to enable both the engine\nf and provide the necessary functional integrity to the interface o r c e\nreplacement has been effected. For this reason, it is desirable :o\nssurant activated components as this eliminates a gaseous QD from ;he\nenterface, If the propellant tanks are left with a blank@$ pressure, a\naE aa:ves will be needed on the vehicle side. The main engine valves should\n1\nl a i n v r t h "Ie engine so they can be serviced after the engine has been removed\n\n(possibly on the SS, likely on the ground).\nThe simplest interface design has all\nQD\'s aligned along a plane which separates the engine and the vehicle. This design\ntype would lend itself to remote engine removal, which is a desirable feature.\nThis approach would likely incur a weight penalty relative to an approach which\nminimizes weight at the expense requiring EVA assistance. Cost modelling o f OTV\nservicing scenarios is expected to aid in recommending which approach t o \' use.\nSPACE STATION FACILITIES\nThe functional and operational analysis just presented have identified five\nbasic space station facilities which will be needed to support a space based OTV,\nThe facilities are shown in Table 7. While the facilities are treated as separa.te\nitems dedicated entirely to the OTV, in the actual space station they will be m o r e\ngeneral purpose facilities designed to support the OTV, OMV and other spacecraft\ndesigned for SS servicing. At this point, the facilities are separated more for\nfunctional reasons than for hardware reasons. The actual SS facilities will\nprobably recombine the functions into units logically arranged as part of the SS\ndesign effort. Therefore, the following facilities discussions emphasize the\nneeded functions divided functionally. Possible overlaps are included in the\nindividual discussions.\nThe servicing hangar will house all the necessary items used fo~rservicing\nthe OTV and other spacecraft. It should be a general purpose facility with some\ndedicated items specifically for servicing the OTV and the SS OMV as these two\nspacecraft will comprise the majority of the servicing requirements. fh means of\nmechanically holding the various spacecraft will be needed. A variety of\numbilicals will also be needed, mostly electrical. It may be desirable to provide\na pressurant umbilical as well. Propellants and other hazardous fluids will be\nhandled at another facility. Power for lighting and power tools should be supplied\nas well as means of securing the astronaut, his tools, and any other loose items\nnecessary. One current hangar concept (Figures 3 and 4) involves a translation\nmechanism for the crewmen and a rotary carriage for the spacecraft. This would\nallow the possibility of a quasi-EMU (extra-vehiclular maneuvering unit) in which\nthe EMU (or spacesuit) shares the SS atmosphere through an umbilical carried with\nthe translation mechanism. In this hangar, total portability would not be\nnecessary since a combination of translation and spacecraft rotation will allow\naccess to all portions of the spacecraft.\nAs with the servicing hangar, many functions of the SS computer system have\nalready been mentioned. Therefore, they will only be summarized here. Only a\nsmall portion of the SS computers\'responsibilities will be represented by the OTV\nactivities. The SS computer will function primarily as a link between the OTV\ncomputer, ground facilities, and the SS crewmen. OTV data stored during the\nmission will be down linked to the ground through the SS computer with a portion\nbeing retained for the SS crewmen to act upon (SS safety related items, for\ninstance). After ground processing, an estimate of the OTV maintenance schedule\nwill be returned to the SS. The SS computer will then factor in maintenance tasks\ndiscovered during post mission processing of the OTV and prepare a final\nmaintenance schedule. The SS computer will also handle loading of the OTV c c s m p ~ l t e r\nwith mission specific data prior to the OTV mission.
