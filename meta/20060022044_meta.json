These materials do not behave like the typical construction materials, and therefore, require new methods for construction. Work done at NASA s Langley Research Center in the realm of active solder joining has led to a new, self-bonding solder that enables high conductivity, as well as the metallic joining of carbon and ceramic materials to a wide range of metals. The original work involved evaluating high- and low-temperature joining technologies for joining carbon composite structures for use in thermal management and reusable launch vehicles. The initial plan for this innovation was to lower the weight of battery packs in satellites. It was a success. NASA scientists found use for this technology in fabricating a thermal management package for battery compartments in the Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites, but it is also being used by the Agency for space radiator panels. Because it is light, simple to use, and economical, NASA will likely find other uses for this solder, just as outside of the Space Agency, this unique bond is finding many practical applications.", "title": "Advanced Joining Technology: Simple, Strong, and Secure", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T17:09:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20060022044, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060022044, "id": "e1965605f50b41789ae13a57b67ea914", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2005", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20060022044.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20060022044/downloads/20060022044.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20060022044/downloads/20060022044.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20060022044/downloads/20060022044.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
