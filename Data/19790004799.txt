Management responsibility\n\nfor this program is within the Low-Cost Silicon Solar Array Project,\n\nin behalf of the US Department of Energy (DOE/ET) Solar Photovoltaic\n\nProgram. The study was commissioned by the LSSA Project Analysis\n\nand Integration Manager, Dr. William T. Callaghan, with Task Force\n\nmonitoring responsibility under the direction of Dr. James W. Doane\n\nand Dr. Jeffrey L. Smith.\n\nThe program described in this final report is an element of\n\nthe JPL analysis of the industrialization process for the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture. As a part of this program, information concerning\n\nthe investment process within US industry was collected. Emphasis\n\nwas placed upon characterizing the critical elements in major\n\nhigh-risk investment decisions by industry. The relationship\n\nbetween these critical elements was interpreted as to how they\n\ninfluence the investment decision outcome.\n\nThe results of this analysis found wide differences between\n\ncompanies in the manner in which evaluation criteria are applied.\n\nEven within similar industrial sectors, totally different behavior\n\npatterns were observed. Motivation was determined to be the\n\ngreatest single force to induce a company to invest in a high-risk\n\nventure. The higher the motivation, both financial and personal,\n\nthe greater the risk a company is prepared to accept in a new\n\ninvestment. The effect of government actions upon these motivations\n\nand the degree of risk acceptance by industry is discussed on a\n\nqualitative as well as a quantitative basis.\n\nThe relative impact of alternative government programs and\n\npolicies upon industry motivations, with its resulting impact upon\n\nphotovoltaic industrialization, is assessed. This assessment is\n\nbased upon field interviews with a cross-section of industry\n\ndecision-makers to solicit their attitudes toward alternative\n\ngovernment programs and policies. The government alternatives have\n\nbeen ranked on the basis of their ease of implementation and their\n\nprobable impact. A commentary is included on the recommended\n\nsequence in which these government policies should be applied to\n\nmaximize the industrialization of the photovoltaic venture.\n\n\nD\n\nCmstc Concepts.

The driving force\n\nfor this study was the perceived need on the part of the government\n\nto accelerate the industrialization of the photovoltaic venture. To\n\nbetter accomplish this, a detailed understanding is needed of the\n\ndecision process used by industrial concerns to select investment\n\nventures.\n\nIt was found that a high degree of judgment, intuitive\n\ninsight, courage, and conviction pervade the decision process in\n\nhigh-risk investments such as the photovoltaic venture. The invest\xc2\xad\nment decision process is further complicated in that it is continu\xc2\xad\nally changing as a result of variations in the national economy,\n\nindustry fluctuations, performance of present investments, management\n\nstyle and ph.ilosophy, competition, technology advancements, and\n\ngovernment actions or inactions. Such an environment does\n\nnot easily lend itself to mathematical modeling or quantitative\n\nanalysis techniques. It is not possible to characterize, catalog,\n\nor classify companies into predictable entities. All companies are\n\nmanaged by personnel subject to many demanding issues and possibly\n\nconflicting requirements. In arriving at an investment decision,\n\nall of these demands must be addressed and prioritized.\n\nThe general conclusions reached within this report are based\n\nupon a sampling of many companies. These companies varied signifi\xc2\xad\ncantly in their relationship to the photovoltaic venture and thus\n\nrepresented a wide spectrum of perspectives. The stated conclusions\n\nare as specific as possible, but caution should be taken if attempt\xc2\xad\ning to apply them to a specific company. They should be applied in\n\nA general sense with the expectation that a variety of companies,\n\nperhaps some not previously considered as likely candidates, will be\n\nattracted to the photovoltaic venture.\n\n\nCGnostk Concepts Inc\n\n1.2\n\nC 0 N C L U S I 0 N S\n\n\nI NFLU ENCE\nOF\nBAR\'R I ER S AND\n\nGOVERNMENT\nRISK\n\n\nACTIONS\n\nON\n\n\nMATRIX OF BARRIERS AND INCENTIVES\n\nA matrix of the perceived barriers to investments and possible\n\ngovernment incentives or actions is shown in Table 1.1.

This is to be distinguished\n\nfrom an investor who has already made the commitment to the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture. Only in a few instances will this distinction make\n\nany significant difference.\n\nThe government incentives have been divided into two major\n\nareas: programs and policies. The distinction is that programs are\n\nassociated with fundings that are identifiable and represent direct\n\nsupport of the photovoltaic industry. Policies represent an\n\nindirect support of the photovoltaic venture. It may not be possible\n\nto identify specifically those dollars involved with supporting\n\npolicies. Tax credits, for instance, may be difficult to identify\n\ndirectly with the photovoltaic venture, but they do represent\n\ngovernment funding, in that at least in some future date, there will\n\nbe a reduction in collected tax revenues.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION ON GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES AND ACTIONS\n\nBased upon the influences that various government incentives\n\nhave upon the overall spectrum of investment barriers and perceived\n\nrisks, the ranking or classifying of government incentives into\n\nrecommended and not recommended use is shown in Table 1.2. In addi\xc2\xad\ntion, two incentive options havebeen listed as having possible use\n\nunder special conditions. The recommended government incentives are:\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nSubsidize research and development activities\n\nEstablish supplier tax preferences\n\nMarket studies\n\nField experiments and demonstrations\n\nEstablish end-user financial assistance\n\n\nThe two possible government incentives that could be imple\xc2\xad\nmented under certain conditions are production demonstrations and\n\nloan guarantees.\n\nThose government incentives that are not recommended for\n\nimplementation in the photovoltaic venture are:\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nSubsidize prices\n\nMarket guarantees\n\nGFE\n\nManagement fee\n\n\nSGcostlc Cocepts, Inc\n\n3\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nTABLE 1.2 \t\nRECOMMENDATIONS ON GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES\n\nGovernment Action \t\n\nCommentary\n\n\nRecommended\n\nSubsidize R&D \t\n\nMost effective cost reduction program\n\n\nSupplier tax preference \t\n\nReduce low financial reward barrier\n\n\nMarket studies \t\n\nDirect at basic driving forces of\n\nmarkets, expand to detailed international\n\nscope, cover institutional issues\n\n\nField experiments/demonstrations \t\n\nRedirect emphases to experimental\n\naspects, direct at future markets on\n\ntimely basis\n\n\nEnd-user financial assistance \t\n\nStimulate market demand, begin with large\n\nincentive but decrease as prices decline\n\n\nPossible\n\nProduction demonstrations \t\n\nDirected at only common materials or\n\nitems for all suppliers; tends to exclude\n\noutsiders, biases market in favor of\n\ninsiders\n\n\nLoan guarantees \t\n\nAppears to have no real influence; may\n\nassist new company formation or special\n\ntemporary company conditions; best\n\napplied to users if needed to stimulate\n\nmarket\n\n\nNot Recommenoed\n\nSubsidize prices \t\n\nOverrules incentive to reduce costs,\n\nprolongs inefficiencies, slows technology\n\nadvancement.\n\n\nMarket guarantee \t\n\nKeeps prices up; inefficient use of tax\n\ndollars, similar influence to price\n\nsubsidies\n\n\nGFE \t\n\nBiases market, does not stimulate market\n\nor advance R&D, freezes production\n\ntechnology, reduces implementation\n\n\nManagement fee \t\n\nSame as GFE\n\n\nIn general, recommended government incentives accomplish the\n\nfollowing objectives:\n\na Provide the most effective means to accomplishing step\n\n\t\nfunctions in the reduction of operating and manufacturing\n\ncosts in the production of photovoltaic products\n\n(subsidize R&D)\n\na Provide a basis for reducing the investment required on the\n\n\t\npart of a company with minimal interference with internal\n\naffairs (supplier tax preferences)\n\n\n4\n\nF\n\nGnostc Concepts Inc\n\na\n\nProvide\nmarkets\nand the\nmarkets\n\ninformation concerning the characteristics of the\nto be served and demonstrate to both the supplier\n\nuser that photovoltaics can be effective in given\n\n(market studies, field experiments/demonstrations)\n\n\n* Provide incentives for the end-user in a financial aspect\n\nthat causes the increase in market demand without control\xc2\xad\nling or dominating the normal market relationships and\n\ndriving forces (end-user financial assistance)\n\nFor those incentives that are listed as not recommended for\n\nthe photovoltaic venture, the primary reasons for not using them are:\n\n* They tend to override the natural market forces and their\n\nnormal relationship to each other\n\nI They tend to significantly interfere with internal affairs\n\n\t\nand the controlling of a company\'s own destiny\n\n* They have a tendency of freezing or retarding the\n\ndevelopment pace of manufacturing and basic technology\n\nThere are those government incentives that under special\n\nconditions could offer momentary or localized positive influences\n\nupon the industrialization process. Before application of these\n\nincentives, however, significant study should be applied to their\n\nneeds and their effect upon the overall long-range objectives of the\n\nindustrialization process. If they can be implemented without\n\ninterfering or distorting developments within a company or overruling\n\nnormal market conditions, then they could very possibly be applied\n\nin specific areas.\n\nAPPLICATION SEQUENCE OF INCENTIVES IMPORTANT\nIn the area of\n\nthe recommended government incentives, it is important to note that\n\nthe sequence in which incentives are applied can accelerate or hinder\n\nthe industrialization process. For instance, it is important that\n\ntechnology be developed first, upon which field experiments and later\n\ndemonstrations can be based. It would be unwise to label a field\n\nexperiment as a demonstration when the technology had not been fully\n\nresolved. A failure in this case would act as a retardant force upon\n\nthe market area to which it was exposed, and possibly discourage\n\ncompanies from entering the photovoltaic venture.\n\nIt would also be wiser to provide the supplier with tax\n\npreferences early in the development stage rather than to the\n\nend-user. An overstimulation of the market conditions could cause\n\nprices to remain at a higher than otherwise expected level.\n\n\nGnCosEk Concepts Inc\n\nThe implementation of an end-user tax preference too early\n\nmay be insufficient to account for the difference in selling price\n\nand the price needed to induce the end-user to purchase a\n\nphotovoltaic-powered product. Thus the tax preference would have\n\nlittle relevance to the mass public. Only the very wealthy would be\n\nable to take advantage of the tax preference. Thus it could be\n\nconcluded by the general public that government was once again\n\nfavoring those who have great financial resources and discriminating\n\nagainst the lesser wealthy individuals within the population.\n\nEnd-user tax preferences must be in relationship to the\n\ndifference between selling price and the price the end-user would\n\nnormally pay for some other source of energy. If that delta differ\xc2\xad\nence is extremely large, this would be an extremely inefficient use\n\nof tax funds. Those funds could better be directed at subsidizing\n\nthe research and development activity and providing a basis for\n\nreducing costs on the supplier side.\n\nA well-coordinated program is thus needed before government\n\nincentives are to be applied. Timing is important in the overall\n\neffect of the government incentives. The fundamental basis for the\n\nphotovoltaic venture is the technology. Second is the supply of\n\ncost-effective products, and third the stimulation and development\n\nof the market to consume the output from production facilities.\n\n\nLEADING\n\nINDICATORS\n\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTS\n\nMEASURABLE LEADING INDICATORS GIVE INSIGHTS\nThe intent is\n\nto identify those le-ading indicators that would give constructive\n\nfeedback on a timely basis to indicate if applied incentives have\n\nactually accelerated or in any fashion influenced the industrializa\xc2\xad\ntion process. It would be desirable to know what the immediate\n\neffect of an incentive is on the development of the markets and the\n\ninvestments being made by companies in the photovoltaic venture. By\n\nhaving such timely leading indicators, it would then be possible to\n\nwithdraw or at least modify incentives that are either not effective\n\nor creating negative influences upon the industrialization process.\n\nDIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW EXACT COMPANY POSITIONS\n\nThe decision on the part of a prospective company to enter the\n\nphotovoltaic venture or to significantly expand its participation in\n\nthe venture will in general be kept secret until the last moment.\n\nIn fact, additional investments by companies that are already in the\n\nphotovoltaic venture may not even be noticeable outside the company\n\nfor many months after the investment has been made. It will, of\n\n\n6\n\nF\n\nCnostk Concepts. Inc\n\ncourse, be obvious at the time of the announcement of a product that\n\na new company has decided to enter the photovoltaic venture.\n\nHowever, the decision to make the investment would have occurred\n\nmany months in advance of the product announcement.\n\nThe conclusion is that it will be very difficult if possible\n\nat all to know the exact position of any company, either presently\n\nin or contemplating entrance into the photovoltaic venture. Leading\n\nindicators in their true sense will be virtually impossible to iden\xc2\xad\ntify. They will be only relative in their nature and may not be\n\nleading at all. Identifiable indicators will consequently have a\n\nsignificant degree of delay built into them simply because of the\n\nsecretive environment that will tend to surround a potential invest\xc2\xad\nment decision. This is a natural occurrence within the highly\n\ncompetitive industrial environment prevalent within the US. It\n\nshould not be looked upon negatively or with great disappointment,\n\nbut instead viewed with the perspective that companies have a\n\nlegitimate need to protect their proprietary and confidential\n\nposition until it is determined in the best interest of the company\n\nto announce their decisions and intended actions.\n\n\nSELECTED INDICATORS\n\nIdentifiable leading indicators that are discussed in the\n\nreport include:\n\nI\ne\na\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\ne\n\nTax report data\n\nTechnology automation trends\n\nAttendance at public meetings\n\nUse of government data for company planning\n\n"Champion" feedback\n\nIndustry organization data\n\nProduct standardization trends\n\nGovernment position\n\nFinancial analysis baseline\n\n\nOf the above indicators, the first five offer some significant input\n\nas to the developments and commitment on the part of companies to\n\nthe photovoltaic industrialization process. The last four, while\n\noffering some insights, offer no timely feedback and thus have\n\nreduced value.\n\nTAX REPORT DATA REQUIRES CHANGE IN TAX FORM\nOnce an\n\nincentive has been established, a method by which to obtain informa\xc2\xad\ntion concerning company investments would be through the use of the\n\nincome tax reporting forms filed annually. If advantage of an\n\nincentive is to be taken by a company, then it could be required that\n\na reporting of all investments in some detail must be reported\n\nthrough the income tax form. This would require a change in the\n\npresent tax form but nothing substantial.\n\n\nF= Gnostic Concepts Inc\n\n7\n\nCertain tax credits or fast write-off of equipment expendi\xc2\xad\ntures and other R&D costs could act as an incentive to a supplier.\n\nThe requirement could be added that if the stimulus is to be applied\n\nagainst the earnings of the company, then the company must report\n\ncertain pertinent information within their tax form. Such informa\xc2\xad\ntion could include estimated number of man-hours devoted to\n\nphotovoltaics, a listing of specific equipment designated for the\n\nphotovoltaic venture, capital costs involved, or any other\n\ninformation that was deemed applicable to indicating the commitment\n\nof a company to the photovoltaic venture.\n\nThe end-user tax form could also be changed to request\n\ninformation concerning price and volume of photovoltaic products\n\npurchased during the year. This assumes that an incentive has been\n\nestablished that would induce an end-user to purchase photovoltaic\n\nproducts. Thus to take advantage of the incentive through tax\n\ncredits or direct rebates, for example, it would require reporting\n\nall of the pertinent information on the income tax form for either a\n\nprivate individual or a company that may be using the photovoltaic\n\nproduct.\n\nTECHNOLOGY AUTOMATION TRENDS\nA significant indicator of the\n\ncommitment to the photovoltaic venture is the degree to which tech\xc2\xad\nnologies are automated. Automation implies that a company envisions\n\nconditions to have stabilized for at least a certain period. It also\n\nindicates that the company has decided which avenues it will pursue\n\nin the production of photovoltaic products.\n\nKnowledge of the automation may not be readily available,\n\nespecially prior to the actual implementation of some of the automa\xc2\xad\ntion equipment. It is unlikely that the intent to automate will be\n\nwidely disseminated. The use of the previously mentioned tax report\n\nform would indicate the extent to which automation equipment is being\n\nimplemented within the photovoltaic industry. Other sources of\n\ninformation concerning automation would have to be from within the\n\ncompanies. It may be difficult or impossible to establish such\n\nsources of information.\n\nATTENDANCE AT PUBLIC MEETINGS\nAssociated with the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture are many public meetings in which attendees register\n\ntheir name, position, and company in which they work. This informa\xc2\xad\ntion could become valuable leading indicator material if properly\n\nanalyzed. The type of information that could be obtained from the\n\nattendees list at public meetings in the photovoltaic venture would\n\ninclude:\n\na\n*\n*\n*\n@\n\n8\n\nName of the companies sending representatives\n\nFrequency of their attendance\n\nType of meeting to which companies send representatives\n\nNumber of representatives sent\n\nLevel or job position within a company that each of the\n\nattendess represents\n\n\nCostic Concepts Inc.\nn\n\nThis information is already within the public domain and would\n\nrequire no new forms or data collection mechanisms. While this type\n\nof indicator would not provide information concerning the quantita\xc2\xad\ntive degree to which a company has committed to the photovoltaic\n\nventure, it would supply information concerning who the potential\n\nnew companies could be in the near term.\n\nUSE OF GOVERNMENT DATA FOR COMPANY PLANNING\nThe government\n\nprovides a tremendous amount oT information concerning the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture, and in particular concerning potential markets and\n\nthe requirements therein. The identification of photovoltaic markets\n\nand their basic driving forces is key to any investment attempts a\n\ncompany may develop. The key indicator would be, does industry use\n\nthe published government data for preparing their strategic plans\n\nand marketing approaches? To verify the use of such government\n\nmarketing material would require a surveying of at least selected\n\ncompanies, both within and outside of the photovoltaic venture.\n\n"CHAMPION" FEEDBACK\nOne of the principal elements that must\n\nbe present in the investment environment is the "champion" of the\n\nproposed investment. This individual will probably be the most\n\ninformed as to where the proposed investment stands within the\n\ncompany\'s investment environment. The identification and continual\n\ncommunication with the "champions" at each prospective company could\n\nbecome a type of leading indicator. Through the communication links\n\nassociated with these "champions," it would be possible to obtain\n\nfeedback information that could be used to modify existing government\n\nincentives or those incentives that are under consideration. A\n\n"testing" of the government incentives under consideration could be\n\nobtained through the reaction of the "champions" at each of the\n\nidentified companies.\n\n\nCONCLUDING STATEMENT ON LEADING INDICATORS\n\nDecisions in industry for high-risk ventures are based on\n\njudgment, courage, and insight in the final analysis, none of which\n\nare truly measurable in quantitative values. As a consequence,\n\nvirtually no analytical perspective can be attached to leading indi\xc2\xad\ncators. Most cannot truly classify &s leading indicators because of\n\nthe lack of timely insfghts. The quantitative measurement of these\n\nindicators is also difficult to support. Without a reliable and\n\nmeasurable set of leading indicators, the only approach that can be\n\ntaken in applying government incentives is to direct such incentives\n\ntoward the fundamentals of the investment environment rather than\n\nthe special conditions that may exist at selected companies. Through\n\napplying fundamentally sound incentives directed at basic barriers\n\nand risks a far greater attraction of the best-qualified companies\n\nfor the industrialization process will occur.\n\n\nOnostk Concepts Inc\n\n9\n\n1.3\n\nS UM M A R Y\nENVIRONMENT\n\n\nDIMENSIONS\n\n0 F\n\nIN VE ST M E NT\n\nD E C I S I 0 N\n\n\nUNCERTAINTY\n\n\nOF\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThere are many elements involved in describing a given\n\ncompany\'s business position or business status. Such elements would\n\ninclude gross revenues on an annual basis, share of market, number\n\nof employees, number of facilities, square footage of facilities,\n\nprofit margins, and many other such items. While these elements do\n\ndescribe in great detail the present status of a company, they add\n\nlittle if any insight into what is involved in arriving at an\n\ninvestment decision concerning a significant shift in their business\n\nposition. Neither do those items place any perspective upon the risk\n\nassociated with that shift.\n\nThere are,\n\nTHREE APPLICABLE ASPECTS TO BUSINESS POSITION\nelements that describe a company\'s business\n\nhowever, identifiable\nposition in such a fashion that the significance of a shift can be\n\nevaluated. Such a description would relate to the characteristics\n\nand elements to be considered in connection with a venture invest\xc2\xad\nment. One such description that involves the principal aspects of a\n\ncompany\'s business position and has relevance to an investment in a\n\nnew venture is portrayed in Figure 1.1.\n\nThe origin of the three-dimensional figure represents the\n\npresent-day business position of a company in regard to:\n\n* Major markets served\n\n* Product available\n\n* Technology base\n\nAny new business investment involves decisions concerning\n\nchanges in these three major aspects of the company\'s present status.\n\nThe degree of change in each element will vary, depending on the\n\nnature and size of the proposed investment. In general, any company\n\nentering the photovoltaic industry will be changing its business\n\nposition, since in most cases no previous activity would have existed\n\nin the photovoltaic area. Consequently, this requires involvement\n\nin new markets using new products built with new technologies that\n\nwere probably not employed by the company prior to entering the\n\nphotovoltaic industry.\n\n\n10\n\nF\n\nCnostc Concepts Inc\n\nFIGURE 1.1\n\nCHANGE IN BUSINESS POSITION\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nTechnology\n\nBase\n\n\nNew Business\n.....\n...............

This will involve investments in product\n\ndevelopment, the establishment of new technologies, and in many\n\ncases include moving into new markets.\n\nA change in a company\'s business\n\nRISK ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGE\nposition includes the decision to invest, the actual capitalization\n\nof that investment, and an evaluation of risks. For any type of\n\nchange in company position, there are always risks. These are the\n\nelements of the investment that cannot necessarily be quantitatively\n\nor analytically described. Judgment, courage, and determination on\n\nthe part of the investing company are often required\n\nto arrive at a decision.\n\n\n2\n\nCnostc Concepts Inc-\n\n1\n\nMAJOR MARKETS SERVED\n\nNot all major markets can be penetrated by photovoltaic\n\nproducts. Certain ones will, however,-hold a much greater potential\n\nfor penetration. To relate the concept of markets served to the\n\nphotovoltaic venture, a selected set of markets in which photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaics will have reasonable penetration potentials is shown in\n\nTable 1.3, along with typical applications therein.\n\nTABLE 1.3\n\nPOTENTIAL PHOTOVOLTAIC MARKETS \t\nAND REPRESENTATIVE APPLICATION AREAS\n\nRepresentative Application Areas\n\n\nPotential Markets\n\nSmall water pumping\n\nIrrigation water ouioing\nDistributive\n\nAgriculture \t\n\nDeep well\n\nCathodic Drotection\n\nGas and Dil dell needs\n\nPipelines\n\nTransmission\n\n\n3istributive\n\nBridges\n\nCommunications\n\nRemote repeaters\n\nDiesel replacement\n\nTEG replacement\n\nPrimary battery replacement\n\nNew sites\n\nNavigational aias\n\nTelemetry\n\n\nConsumer Electronics \t\n\ndatches\n\nCalculators\n\nRecreational vehicles\n\nBattery chargers\n\nBackpacking\n\n\nElectric Power \t\n\nGovernment/Military \t\n\nPortable field communications\n\nWater purification\n\nRemote installation power\n\nTest facilities\n\nDemonstration projects\n\n\nHousing & Construction\n\nConsumer facilities\n\nSingle-family\n\nVacation homes\n\nCommercial facilities\n\nInstitutional facilities\n\nIndustrial complexes\n\n\nRural Electrification \t\n\nLighting\n\nWater pumping\n\nVillage industries\n\nMedical supply storage\n\n\nOther \t\n\n12\n\nCentral power generation\n\nSubstations\n\nDistributed power generation\n\n\nElectric vehicle\n\nRoad signs\n\nStreet lights\n\n\n2q Gnosrk Concepts Inc\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nFor the present and future suppliers of photovoltaics, these\n\nmarkets will in general be new and untested. Entering such markets\n\nwill have associated with them tremendous risks in attempting\n\nto identify applications, customers, and methods of penetration.\n\nAdditionally. there will be channels of distribution, methods of\n\ndoing business, service requirements, payment schedules, and many\n\nother items that could conceivably be uniquely different from past\n\npractices for these photovoltaic supplier companies. Supplying to\n\nthese new markets will not necessarily be an extension of older\n\npractices from other market areas with which the companies are\n\nfamiliar.\n\n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n\nProducts are those physical items which a company ships to a\n\nuser through various distribution channels and in return receives\n\nsome financial payment or reward. The customer which receives these\n\nproducts may or may not be the ultimate end-user. The products may\n\nbe combined with other components or other products to form a more\n\ncomplex or a higher value added end-product that is then distributed\n\nto end-users.\n\nThe typical product supplied by photovoltaic companies will\n\nbe flat-plate photovoltaic panels which are then combined with other\n\ncomponents or products, such as batteries, structural material, power\n\nconditioning equipment, and electrical interconnection material, to\n\nprovide a photovoltaic power supply. This in itself is a product,\n\nbut even this product will ultimtely be combined with some other\n\npiece of equipment, such as a microwave relay tower or a water pump,\n\nto provide a functional product for some end-user.\n\nBASIC ELEMENTS OF PRODUCTS\nelements:\n\n\nProducts have three basic\n\n\n* Design\n\n* Packaging\n\na Manufacturing processes and techniques\n\nA change in any of these three elements could constitute product\n\ndevelopment. Minor changes in any of these three aspects may simply\n\nbe considered a correctional action on the part of the supplier to\n\novercome some minor defect. However, significant changes in any of\n\nthese three aspects would imply product development.\n\nPRODUCTS THE EASIEST TO EVALUATE\nGenerally speaking,\n\nproducts are the easiest of the three major aspects of a company\'s\n\nbusiness to define quantitatively and to analyze accurately.\n\nProducts can be described through specifications, material content,\n\nand performance characteristics. Variations in these specifications\n\n\nSCnostic Concepts Inc\n\n13\n\ncan be directly related to financial investments and the required\n\nresources that must be brought together to formulate the change.\n\nPerformance characteristics of products are generally the most\n\ndifficult to guarantee early in the investment decision process.\n\nHowever, a significant amount of accumulated experience is usually\n\navailable within the design and manufacturing staff to be able to\n\neffectively reduce the risks associated with meeting ultimate\n\nperformance requirements.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY BASE\n\nThe technology base of a given company, in broad terms, is\n\nthe collection of all of the subtechnologies, processes, and manu\xc2\xad\nfacturing techniques required to produce the company\'s products. In\n\ngeneral, there are selected elements within this collection that give\n\nthe technology base its predominant characteristics.\n\nThe semiconductor industry can be used to typify technology\n\ndefinitions and to distinguish between processes, manufacturing\n\ntechniques, and subtechnologies. A limited sample of the technology\n\nbases, subtechnologies, processes, and manufacturing techniques used\n\nin the semiconductor industry are shown in Figure 1.2. This example\n\nis from the manufacturing area for the circuit devices or chips, as\n\nthis area has the most relevance to the photovoltaic venture.\n\nTECHNOLOGY BASE COMPOSED OF SUBTECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES, AND\n\nMANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES\nThe technology base is composed of\n\na group of subtechnool--Tes which have both major and minor elements.\n\nEach of the subtechnologies, in turn, is composed of a series of\n\nmajor and minor processes. The manufacturing techniques are those\n\nphysical items that must be performed in accordance with the process\n\nspecifications. The example used here is the bipolar technology base\n\nfor the semiconductor industry. If, however, a different technology\n\nbase were selected, then a different composition of subtechnologies,\n\nprocesses, and manufacturing techniques would have to be implemented.\n\nMany elements described in the bipolar process may be entirely suit\xc2\xad\nable for use within this different technology base. However, the\n\nspecific collection required for the bipolar technology base could\n\nnot satisfy the requirements of the base technology for SOS (silicon\xc2\xad\non-sapphire), or any other base technology.\n\nFREQUENT CHANGE ONLY AT LOW END OF TECHNOLOGY HIERARCHY\n\nWithin the hierarchy ot the technology base, which includes the\n\nsubtechnologies, processes, and manufacturing techniques, it is noted\n\nthat the further down in the hierarchy one proceeds, the more flexi\xc2\xad\nbility and likelihood of evolutionary changes exist. For instance,\n\nmanufacturing techniques will constantly be changed and implemented\n\nas new ideas are generated. However, it is very unlikely that a\n\n\n14\n\nP7 Cno5tc Concepts Inc\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nFIGURE 1.2\n\nDISTINCTION BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY BASE, SUBTECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES,\nAND MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES\nTF >\n\n[....\n\n\nSOS\n\n-\n\nI\n\nMOS\n\n-\n\nII\n\nIon\nTelnblge\n\nBiolr\n\n-\n\nDiffusion\n\nEpitial\n\nflorhisgrpny\n\nC rowth\n\n[mrplanstan\n\nSihc\n\nI\n\nWafer\n\nNadCtion\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\ni\n\nCodTutor\n\nBose\n\nEmitter\n\nIsolation\n\nWet\n\nPlasma\n\nNegative\n\nPoiivem\n\nDifusion\n\nEtching\n\nEtchng\n\nResist\n\nResist\n\nDiffuson\n\nF\n\nDiffuo.\n\nDUffuson\n\nI\n\ni\n\niffsion\n\niI\n\niI\n\nDiffion\n\nElectricl\n\nCntact\n\nPnaomsy\n\nFnojectin\n\nTinses\n\nTesting\n\nPrinting\n\nPrnting\n\nMas king\n\nCieot/Inspectian\n\nI\n\nIIII\n\nEm\n\nGomaee\nWafer\nTem~e ?re\n\n"Manufacturi\nng\nTehnuquen$\n\nF\nL\n\nI\n\nPlow\n\natl\n\nInsertion\n\nMasks\n\nAutoreaui]c\n\nTemperatrne\nRamping\n\nExlposure\nTi\n\n~sin\n1s\nMasks\n\nNotcsnn\nPrinting\nlor\nMonks\n\nBddng\n\nCcles\n\ncompany will ever change from one base technology to another unless\n\nsurvival is at stake. Additional base technologies could be added\n\non occasion to broaden company capabilities. This would also allow\n\nfor a transition or evolutionary changeover from one technology base\n\nto another if so desired, but the time period would be very long.\n\nNo sudden shift will occur.\n\nWhile manufacturing techniques may continually be in a state\n\nof flux, there is a certain solidarity and stability associated with\n\nthe processes. Process changes occur more slowly than do changes in\n\nthe manufacturing techniques.\n\nSubtechnology changes are even more rare than process changes.\n\nOnly long-range evolutionary changes will be noted in subtechnology\n\nchanges.\n\nThus as one moves down through the hierarchy of the technology\n\nbase, one finds increasing opportunities for evolutionary changes\n\noccurring; but at the same time, there is a decreasing level of\n\ninvestment required with these changes. Conversely, going up through\n\nthe hierarchy of the technology base, one finds an increasing reluc\xc2\xad\ntance to change and larger capital investments required for such\n\nchanges.\n\n\n2Gnostk Concepts. Inc\n\n15\n\n\nWILLINGNESS TO AUTOMATE BASED ON PERCEIVED STABILITY\n\nThe willingness to automate a new technology concept is dependent\n\nupon the perceived stability or maturity of the new technology within\n\na given time frame. For instance, if the technology appears to be\n\nsafe and secure for the next five years, automation may take place.\n\nHowever, if it is perceived that an even newer technology may replace\n\nthe present new technology within two years, then automation will.\n\nnot take place unless influenced by government policies. Such a\n\npolicy could be rapid depreciation, such that the investment could\n\nbe recouped within the two-year period.\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP OF DIMENSIONS OF UNCERTAINTY\n\nThe relationship between the three major aspects of a\n\ncompany\'s business position and the hierarchy of the photovoltaic\n\nventure is shown in Figure 1.3. At the base of the hierarchy are\n\nphotovoltaic technology aspects involved in assembly of photovoltaic\n\npanels or concentrator units, along with technologies of solar cell\n\ndevices and materials involved.\n\nThe photovoltaic product aspects began with the assembly of\n\nphotovoltaic panels into photovoltaic arrays. The arrays are then\n\ncoupled together with other components, including batteries, power\n\nconditioning, physical structures, and electrical interconnections,\n\nto form a solar power supply.\n\nThe solar power supply is then integrated into the design of\n\na functional unit. Such functional units would include water pumps,\n\nmicrowave repeater sites, battery chargers, or special products such\n\nthat the end result is a functioning unit that performs a useful\n\nservice.\n\nThese photovoltaic products can then be applied to various\n\napplications within many market segments. A given product may be\n\napplied to several applications within one market segment, or may be\n\nused in applications throughout several major markets. In general,\n\na photovoltaic product will have been designed for a specific appli\xc2\xad\ncation within a given market, but through only slight modifications\n\nmay find suitable application within other major markets.\n\n\n16\n\n= Gnostic Concepts Inc\n\nFIGURE 1.3\nHIERARCHY OF MARKETS, APPLICATIONS, PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nMajor Photovoltoic Markets Served\n\nPhotovoltaic\n\no\n\nMarket\nAspects\n\nV\n\n0e\n\no\n\n*\n\nel\n\nPow0eS\n3\n\n6\n\nt\nVarious Photovoltaic Powered\nFunctional Units\nWater\nPump\n\nMicrowave\nRepeater\n\nBattery General Purpose Special Packaged\nCharger Power Supply\nPhotovoltaic Cells\n\nPhotovoltaict\nAspects\n\nPhotovoltaic Power Supply\n\nBattery\n\nPower\nConditioning\n\nPhotovoltaic\nArray\n\nt\n\nStructure\n\nPhotovoltaic\n\nPanel Assembly\n\nTechnology\nAspects\n\nInterconnect\n\nSolar Cell Structure\n\nMaterials\n\n\nS Gnostic Concepts. Inc\n\n17\n\nCHANGE\n\nIN\n\nBUSINESS\n\nPOSITION\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe investment in a new venture not only includes the brihging\n\ntogether of the various company resources, but also a selection of\n\nthe route a company will follow in arriving at the new business\n\nposition. There are an infinite number of routes available. They\n\ncan be categorized through a description of the order or sequence in\n\nwhich the three major aspects of the new business position will be\n\npursued. By grouping the routes in such a fashion, certain predomi\xc2\xad\nnant characteristics can be noted. Each group of routes will have\n\nits own advantages and disadvantages and methods of handling risk.\n\nThe particular route that a company may follow can be heavily influ\xc2\xad\nenced by government activities, competition, previously established\n\ncompany resources, and changing market conditions.\n\nThe basie routes by which a company can move to a new business\n\nposition include:\n\n* Direct route\n\n* Series development route\n\na Combined development route\n\nThere is no reason to believe that a company must remain upon\n\none of these particular routes once they have begun to move into an\n\ninvestment area. It may be that through the obtaining of additional\n\ndata and information, an entirely different route will be selected\n\nmidway through the venture to complete the final stages of the\n\ninvestment. Thus combinations of the above-mentioned routes could\n\nadd tremendous variations to the available options, depending on a\n\ncompany\'s particular situation.\n\n\nDIRECT ROUTE\n\nThe direct route involves the investment of resources into\n\nthe development of all three aspects of the company\'s business\n\nposition simultaneously. It implies that a company has concluded\n\nthey have tremendous resources available and sufficient information\n\nin all three aspects to successfully accomplish the required tasks.\n\nHIGH-RISK APPROACH\nThis is the highest-risk route, espe\xc2\xad\ncially if only company resources are being used. This requires\n\ninvestments to be made in technology, product, and market development\n\nsimultaneously. Thus all of the risk associated with each of these\n\naspects are compounded and require a tremendous coordination effort\n\nwithin the company to keep the total investment to a minimum.\n\n\n18\n\nM Cnosttc Concepts Inc\n\nPursuit of this route often increases the overall investment\n\nbecause of the lack of timely feedback from market inquiries to\n\ninfluence product development. In addition, commitments within the\n\nmarketplace may be made that cannot be supported as a result of a\n\nslower product or technology development than originally assumed.\n\nACQUISITIONS REDUCE RISK\nPursuit of the direct route usually\n\nis associated with an acquisition or a series of acquisitions.\n\nThrough the acquisition, many things can be accomplished simultane\xc2\xad\nously. The acquisition of a company already in the newly desired\n\nmarkets provides a foundation of customer contacts, knowledge\n\nconcerning the customer\'s needs, and pricing information, including\n\nprice elasticity data. Depending on the nature of the acquisition,\n\na product or manufacturing technology base can also be acquired.\n\n\nSERIES DEVELOPMENT ROUTE\n\nIn contrast to the direct route is the series development\n\nroute, in which a new business position is obtained through a series\n\nof developments. Typically such a sequence would be the development\n\nof a technology base, then products, then the development of new\n\nmarkets. While other combinations of these three aspects could be\n\ndevised, this is the most frequent approach if only company funds\n\nand internal development activities are to be used.\n\nTECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE DEVELOPED FIRST\nThe development of a\n\ntechnology after product development or market development simply\n\nrestricts the rewards to be gained. If the technology development\n\nis required, then it should occur before product and market develop\xc2\xad\nment efforts if maximum return on the investment is to be obtained.\n\nThe technology is the foundation of the three-dimensional change of\n\na company\'s business position.\n\nREDUCES RISK OVER DIRECT ROUTE AND ADDS FLEXIBILITY\n\nThe series development route reduces the risk considerably over the\n\ndirect route. The drain on the company\'s resources at any given\n\nmoment is also less severe. Additionally, it allows for significant\n\npositive feedback to influence the development route being pursued.\n\nThe disadvantage of this route, however, is that it requires a\n\ntremendously long developmental time.\n\nAnother advantage of this approach is that the sequence can\n\nbe stopped at any moment and other options pursued. It offers\n\nsignificant flexibility, especially in areas where a company is not\n\nextremely confident of the market details.\n\n\nM Gnostc Concepts, Inc\n\n19\n\nCOMBINED DEVELOPMENT ROUTE\n\nThere also exists an infinite number of combinations of the\n\ndirect and the series development routes that can in general be\n\nsegregated into two categories:\n\na Parallel series development route\n\na Series parallel development route\n\nThere can even be combinations of the above two types of routes, as\n\nthe approaches to a new business position are as varied as there are\n\ncompanies desiring to reach new business positions.\n\nTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT INVOLVED IN EARLY PART OF SEQUENCE\n\nThe most common approach used in the parallel series route is that\n\nof first developing the technology base and the appropriate products\n\nsimultaneously and then introducing them into new markets. For the\n\nseries parallel development route, the most common approach is to\n\nfirst develop a technology base, then pursue the development of\n\nproducts and new markets in a simultaneous fashion. This is typical\n\nof large corporations that have significant technology research and\n\ndevelopment facilities.\n\nGOVERNMENT ACTIONS CAN INFLUENCE RATE OF DEVELOPMENT\n\nRisks can be reduced in these approaches through a series of small\n\nacquisitions and/or government fundings. The parallel pursuit of\n\ntwo aspects of a desired new position can be handled by most\n\ncompanies. However, the development of all three aspects at once is\n\nvery seldom pursued. Through government actions, if the risks or\n\ninvestment can be reduced in one or two of the three aspects, then a\n\ncompany may be able to accelerate its arrival at the new business\n\nposition. Combining government actions and a series of small\n\nacquisitions can accelerate the arrival even faster.\n\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\nOF\n\nCOMPANI ES\n\n\nNEED TO CLASSIFY\n\nThe approaches to developing a new business position are\n\nvaried in nature, size, and the route pursued. To arrive at some\n\ncommon denominators such as perceived barriers to investments, basic\n\nelements of the investment process, and items influencing the final\n\ninvestment decision, there is a need to classify companies in a\n\nmeaningful order.\n\n\n20\n\nGnostic Concepts, Inc\n\nOne of the most common methods of classifying companies is to\n\nsegregate them by their industry type. Examples of this would be\n\npetroleum-based, chemical-based, material, industrial, and semi\xc2\xad\nconductor companies. Within each of these industry-type classifica\xc2\xad\ntions, the companies can be subgrouped still further by their annual\n\ndollar volume of business and assets. Other schemes of classifying\n\nthese industrial types would include segregating them by markets\n\nserved or by the type of structure that the company represents; i.e.,\n\na narrow-based company serving relatively few markets, or structured\n\nin the form of a conglomerate in which there are many divisions and\n\nsubsidiaries serving many market areas. Still other classification\n\nschemes could be based upon their technology or their type of\n\nproducts.\n\nIn all of these cases, very little insight is obtained as to\n\nwhat the investment processes are: namely, how a final decision is\n\nmade concerning an investment, how risk is handled, or what the\n\nperceived barriers may be to an investment, especially in a high\xc2\xad\nrisk area such as the photovoltaics venture. Thus there is a need\n\nfor a classification scheme that brings to the forefront the\n\nmotivations why a company would invest in a high-risk operation.\n\n\nCLASSIFICATION BY MOTIVATION AND PHOTOVOLTAIC RELATIONSHIP\n\nFOUR COMPANY GROUPINGS IN RELATION TO PHOTOVOLTAIC VENTURE\n\nIn addition to motivation as a means of classifying companies, an\n\nadditional perspective is based upon their relationship to the\n\nphotovoltaic venture; i.e., their relationship to the technologies\n\ninvolved, the products, and the markets to be served. Combining\n\nthese two schemes gives greater insights into how a company may view\n\nthe ramifications in the photovoltaic venture.\n\nThe concept of classifying companies as to their relationship\n\nto the photovoltaic venture and their motivation for making the\n\ninvestment is shown in Table 1.4. The photovoltaic industry can be\n\nlooked upon as one that supplies electrical generating equipment.\n\nThus the first classification of companies that would be identified\n\nwould be those that are:\n\na Suppliers of energy-generating equipment\n\ne Suppliers of materials that would allow for the generation\n\nof electrical energy\n\n* Related peripheral equipment companies\n\nThese companies will be influenced by a significant photovoltaic\n\nindustry development program. Their markets will especially be\n\ninfluenced in a direct fashion.\n\n\n2\n\nGnstk Concept Inc.\n\n21\n\nTABLE 1.4\n\nCOMPANY GROUPINGS BY INVESTMENT MOTIVATION\n\nInvestment Motivation\n\nCompany Groups\n\nMajor\n\nMinor\n\nEnergy Market Companies\nConsumable producers\nEnergy-generating\nequipment manufacturers\n\nProtect market position\nthrough diversification\nin energy business\n\nEnhance image\nShort/intermediate\xc2\xad\nterm ROI\n\nLong-term ROI\nRelated equipment\nmanufacturers\nLarge Energy Users\n\nFunctional systems\nsupolier\n\nProtect/develop supply\nsource\n\n\nROT\n\n\nMajor business spin-off\n\nDiversification\n\n\nHigh growth, near-longterm ROI\n\n\nimage\n\n\nRelated Technology\n\nCompanies\n\nSemiconductor-based\ncompanies\n\nMaterials-oriented\nfirms\n\n\nIndustry technology leader\n\nUnrelated Companies\n\nConglomerates\n\nHigh growth, good ROI\n\nImage\n\n\nDiversification\n\nLong-range position\n\n\nEnhance other markets\n\n\nAnother category of companies are those firms that are\n\ninvolved in the consumption of the electric energy that is generated.\n\nIn particular, reference is being made here to large energy users\n\nwho may require a capzive source of electrical energy.\n\nThese two categories of companies thus cover the market and\n\nthe product aspect of a photovoltaic business position.\n\nA third category of companies that would be involved or\n\ninterested in photovoltaic industry developments would be those that\n\nhave a compatible or related technology base. This would not only\n\ninclude a technology in the solar cell device area, but also tech\xc2\xad\nnologies in the generation and production of the basic raw materials\n\nthat may be consumed in or part of photovoltaic products. This type\n\nof company covers the third aspect of the photovoltaic business\n\nposition, namely the technology base.\n\n\n22\n\nF\n\nGnostic Concepts. Inc\n\nA fourth type of company classification also exists. This\n\nwould be the company that has no relationship at the present time to\n\nthe photovoltaic industry or the energy-producing industry. There\n\nexist such companies that will be motivated to enter this particular\n\npotential high-growth industry as a result of an internal\n\ndiversification objective.\n\nMAJOR AND-MINOR MOTIVATIONS\nThe motivation for any of these\n\ntypes of companies to invest in the photovoltaic venture can be\n\nbroken into major and minor groupings. An investment in the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic industry will always be driven by one or more major motiva\xc2\xad\ntions. At the same time, there may be several minor motivations that\n\nwould also encourage a company to make the investment. However,\n\nthese by themselves would not be of sufficient magnitude to cause a\n\ncompany to make the necessary investments. These minor motivations\n\nserve to round out the total package for justifying the entrance into\n\na high-risk photovoltaic venture.\n\nIn summary, the major\n\nSUMMARY OF MAJOR AND MINOR MOTIVATIONS\nmotivations for a company to invest in a photovoltaic venture would\n\ninclude:\n\na\na\n*\n*\na\na\n*\n\nProtect market position through diversification\nLong-term return on investment\nMajor business spin-off\n\nHigh-growth opportunity\n\nTechnology extension\n\nEnhance other markets\n\nProtect or provide assured sources of products\n\n\nThe minor motivations would include:\n\n* Enhance company image\n\n* Intermediate return on investment\n\n* Long-range position\n\nAny actions that the federal government may take in its photovoltaic\n\nprogram should thus be directed at causing an increase in the\n\nmotivations for a company to make an investment. In addition,\n\ngovernment actions should be so designed as to not eliminate any of\n\nthe potential companies that may have any motivation for entering\n\nthe photovoltaic industry.\n\n\nM Cost Concepts Inc\n\n23\n\nSPECTRUM\nOF\nDECISION\nRELATED\nINFLUENCES\n\n\nMETHODS\n\nAND\n\n\nSOURCES OF INVESTMENT PROPOSALS\n\nBefore a company can arrive at a decision to invest in photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaics or any other venture, there must be a proposal set forth\n\nthat suggests that an investment be made. Some source and mechanism\n\nfor bringing this proposed investment to the attention of the\n\ncorporate decision makers must exist within the company.\n\nFOUR BASIC INVESTMENT PROPOSAL SOURCES\nThere are four basic\n\nsources that can generate an investment proposal and carry it forward\n\nto the attention of the appropriate individuals.\n\nThe major sources for investment proposals include:\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nThe business unit\n\nA corporate executive\n\nThe corporate research and development group\n\nVenture analysis group\n\n\nWithin a given company, any one or a combination of these investment\n\nproposal avenues may exist. In addition, there may be specialized\n\nmethods by which investment proposals are also generated within those\n\ncompanies.\n\nMECHANISTIC ASPECTS ONLY COMMONALITY BETWEEN COMPANIES\n\nIt should be noted that any of these approaches within a oiven\n\ncompany will differ from its counterpart in some other company, even\n\nwithin the same industrial classification of companies or any other\n\nclassification that may be applied. In effect, each company tailors\n\nthe basic investment proposal procedures and builds into them those\n\nitems that the company wishes to accentuate.\n\nBUSINESS UNIT UP PROCESS\nThe most common approach to devel\xc2\xad\nopment of a new business venture is from the grass roots level,\n\nespecially in a major organization. The idea germinates within a\n\ndivision at a relatively low level and builds slowly, ultimately\n\nbecoming a line item in the division\'s overall business plan. It\n\ndoes not become visible to the corporate executive level until it\n\nnas reached a size that requires an investment above a predetermined\n\nlevel, depending upon how the product and the potential liability to\n\nthe organization has been defined.\n\nBy this time, the investment has received the adamant support\n\nof at least one or more "champions." Such a "champion" will carry\n\nthe bulk of the effort in seeing that all of the necessary require\xc2\xad\nments for a corporate review are met. In most cases, this individual\n\nis one who is known and creditable to the executive staff of the\n\ncompany.\n\n\n24\n\n9 Crtk Coaptp\n\nix\n\nThe new proposed venture also generally will fit within a\n\nparticular market interest of the supporting division and will have\n\nat least a long-term potential for excellent return on investment.\n\nIn addition, the proposed idea will generally fit the accustomed\n\nmanner of marketing and distribution of the other divisional\n\nproducts. There are exceptions to this, where the company has strong\n\ndiversification tendencies and divisions are given wide latitudes.\n\nThis is not, however, the general case.\n\nCORPORATE EXECUTIVE DOWN PROCESS\nOccasionally the corporate\n\nexecutive leve will strategize that the company should move into\n\nanother investment area. The suggestion for an investment may come\n\nfrom a single individual within the corporate staff or from a group\n\nof individuals who feel such investments should at least be\n\ninvestigated.\n\nOften the decision process in this case is not based upon\n\nnearly the large amount of quantitative data that would ordinarily\n\nbe used should a division submit a new investment consideration to\n\nthe executive staff. Upon receipt of a suggested investment area,\n\nthe appropriate division will generate an implementation plan and\n\nresubmit it to the executive staff for approval. In many cases,\n\napproval of the basic concept has probably already been implied and\n\nit now becomes a matter of approving the tactical details. In\n\neffect, the "champion" is a decision maker at a corporate level and\n\nby his nature will not require as sophisticated a justification as\n\nhe might otherwise require on an investment in which he is not as\n\nfamiliar or emotionally involved.\n\n. The investment proposal process within the supporting division\n\nis essentially the same as described in the business unit up process,\n\nexcept that less detail is usually needed and a quicker decision can\n\nbe arrived at due to the prior interest on the part of the corporate\n\nstaff. If, however, the corporate staff member who suggested the\n\ninvestment proposal originally is not a dominant member of the\n\ncorporate decision group, the proposal may require the same depth of\n\nanalysis as would otherwise be required.\n\nCORPORATE R&D GROUP PROCESS\nAnother source of investment\n\nproposals is the corporate research and development (R&D) group. A\n\nmajor function of many corporate R&D groups is to stay abreast of\n\nthe technologies affecting their company\'s basic business, including\n\ndeveloping technologies that may represent reasonably allied future\n\ndiversification programs. In most cases, the R&D group in following\n\nand developing technologies attempts to transfer the technology to\n\nan operating divisional group at the earliest possible time. This\n\nis done because the divisions truly have greater resources for\n\nimplementing the new technologies, particularly in the business and\n\nmarketing area. Even in the cases where the technology is not\n\ndirectly related to a division\'s products, the R&D group will attempt\n\n\nF= Gmsmc Cc-ept In\n\n25\n\nto place the technology in the most appropriate division. Once the\n\ntechnology base has been successfully transferred to a division, the\n\ninvestment proposal process follows the business unit up procedures.\n\nVENTURE ANALYSIS GROUP PROCESS\nWithin many companies there\n\nexists a specialized group known as the venture analysis group. The\n\nobjective of this group is to investigate programs that might lean\n\nto the continued investment of company resources into high-growth\n\nopportunities. This group will pursue and analyze proposed concepts\n\nfor investments from many sources. They would include sources within\n\nthe group, from the R&D organizations, from the various business\n\nunits, the corporate staff, and from sources outside the company\n\nalso.\n\nWhere such organizations exist, all proposed invesments,\n\nregardless of source, will be funneled through this venture analysis\n\ngroup. This group will be especially equipped to supply all of the\n\nneeded information for the executive staff at the time a decision\n\nmust be made. The actual work in the preparation of the reports may\n\nul.timately have to be supplied by the supporting division or the R&D\n\ngroup, but it will be under the direction of this venture analysis\n\ngroup and special assistance will be made available.\n\nThe processes and procedures carried out by the venture\n\nanalysis group do not differ in substance from those required of a\n\nbusiness unit up proposal process. The advantage of a company\n\nhaving a venture analysis group is that more opportunities can be\n\ninvestigated, coordinated, and ranked.\n\n\nEXISTENCE OF FINAL AUTHORITY\n\nOnce all of the necessary requirements of the investment\n\nproposal process are met, there still needs to be a final decision\n\nmade by the corporate staff before an investment can be finalized.\n\nThe involvement of the corporate executives responsible for the final\n\ninvestment decision adds a new element into the investment picture.\n\nThe existence of this final authority is for the purpose of support\xc2\xad\ning or changing the nature of the investment or denying investments\n\nin high-risk ventures.\n\nThe size of the final\n\nSIZE OF FINAL AUTHORITY GROUP VARIES\nautnority group can vary from one to many members. The size is\n\ngenerally unrelated to the size of the corporation. The exception\n\nto this case would be for the newly formed or very small corpora\xc2\xad\ntions, where typically a one-member final authority will dominate\n\nsuch companies. However, for the medium-sized to large corporation,\n\nthere appears to be little relationship to company resources, size,\n\nor any other physical and financial parameters.\n\n\n26\n\n= Cnostc Concepts Inc\n\nThere are several large corporations that are run by single\xc2\xad\nmember final authorities. Likewise, there are large corporations\n\nthat are directed by a multimember final authority group. The size\n\nof the group is more related to an evolutionary development process\n\nthan any other identifiable characteristic. If the original founding\n\ngroup or at least a group of individuals that were extremely dominant\n\nduring the early development of a corporation is still present, then\n\nthe final authority group is composed of a small group of individ\xc2\xad\nuals. If, however, over the years there has been a change in top\n\ncorporate executives and a growth in the corporation, the tendency\n\nfor the formation of a larger final authority group is more evident.\n\nDOMINANT MEMBERS IN ALL GROUP SIZES\nIn those cases where\n\nthe multimember group that forms the final authority has grown in\n\nexcess of seven to eight people, there is the informal evolution of\n\nan inner subgroup. This subgroup tends to dominate the thinking and\n\nactivities of the larger group. These are the more influential\n\nmembers of the corporate staff who have developed a strong political\n\nbase within the corporate structure.\n\nFor those groups that range from the threeto seven-member\n\nsize, there is always a single dominant personality within the group.\n\nThe remaining members play a supportive role to this dominant figure.\n\n\nMAJOR COMPONENTS IN THE FINAL DECISION PROCESS\n\nThe final decision process is a critical element in the\n\noverall investment environment. The interaction of the final\n\ndecision authority and the supporting "champion" of the proposed\n\ninvestment, along with the influences of the statistical and\n\nanalytical parameters are portrayed in Figure 1.4.\n\nThe final authority group makes no decisions unless requested.\n\nThere must be some outside influence forcing the group to make a\n\ndecision concerning an investment. Even in the case where an\n\ninvestment suggestion or strategy is put forth by a member of the\n\nfinal decision-making group, it must be sent downstream within the\n\ncorporation and resubmitted through normal channels with all of the\n\nsupporting information.\n\nMAIN ELEMENTS INTERACTING DURING FINAL DECISION PROCESS\n\nT1here are tnree main elements that come to play during the final\n\ndecision process that will influence the decision of the group..\n\nThese influences include:\n\n\nGcr tc Concets.

Such a "champion" must exist regardless of\n\nthe company size or structure and must usually be in\n\naddition to. any "champion" that may exist within the\n\nultimate decision-making group. The strength and stature\n\nof an active "champion" of the proposed investment is\n\ncritical and will have a significant influence upon the\n\nfinal decision.\n\n* The results of quantitative analysis. These analyses are\n\nbased primarily upon financial parameters, such as the\n\nreturn on investment, return on assets, discounted cash\n\nflow analysis, present value of investments, payback\n\nperiod, and many other sensitivity analyses as may be\n\ndetermined by the ultimate decision-makers.\n\n*The relative knowledge and opinion on qualitative issues by\n\nbath the "champion" and the final authority group.\n\nQualitative issues include such items as technology risk\n\nevaluations, market size projections, government influences,\n\ncompetition and share of market potential, proper timing to\n\nenter the market, and compatibility with corporate\n\nobjectivyes.\n\n\n28 \n\n\n2\n\nGnostkc Concepts Inc\n\nINTERACTION OF COMPONENTS\nIt is the quantitative analysis\n\nthat provides the foundation for the initial discussions concerning\n\nthe proposed investment. The qualitative issues can, however, become\n\nthe dominant factor in the final decision process. It is the role\n\nof the "champion" to act as a catalyst and to be prepared on all of\n\nthe qualitative and the analytical issues. He is the salesman of\n\nthe proposed investment and in general must convince the final\n\ndecision-makers of the validity, need, and ultimate reward to be\n\ngained from the proposed investment.\n\nIn general, the final decision-making group will be reluctant\n\nto make any investment and will be interested in only the best\n\ninvestment that can be made out of all of the potential opportuni\xc2\xad\nties. Especially for the mediumto larger-sized corporations, there\n\nare always significant numbers of investment opportunities being\n\npresented for consideration and each investment opportunity will be\n\nsupported by some operating division and "champion." Thus each\n\ninvestment opportunity is in effect not only trying to meet minimum\n\ncompany standards, but is competing with all of the other investment\n\nopportunities that are being proposed.\n\n\nPERCEIVED\nINVESTMENT\nBARRIERS\nGOVERNMENT\nINCENTIVES\n\n\nAND\n\n\nPERCEIVED INVESTMENT BARRIERS\n\nThe insights to the motivations to invest, the elements of\n\nthe investment proposal process and final decision environment, and\n\ncompany characteristics lead to the identification of investment\n\nbarriers. There are no two companies in the US industrial complex\n\nthat are uniquely alike. They each have their own special charac\xc2\xad\nteristics, history, tradition, and personality. Thus what may appear\n\nto be a barrier to one company may not be considered a serious\n\nbarrier to another company. Generalizations can, however, be made\n\nalong with some observations concerning the perception and types of\n\nbarriers that are encountered.\n\nIt is important to realize that barriers to the entrance into\n\na given investment opportunity are subject to judgment. Barriers\n\nare perceived and subject to interpretation. Predicting how one\n\nspecific company will react to a given policy designed to reduce the\n\nheight of an investment barrier is extremely difficult if not\n\ncompletely impossible.\n\n\nSGnostc Concepts Inc.\n\n29\n\nBarriers can take the form of either\n\nTWO TYPES OF BARRIERS\nabsolute barriers that completely keep a company from making an\n\ninvestment, or they can be secondary barriers that influence the\n\nmanner in which they make the investment. These secondary barriers\n\nmay also be of sufficient size to restrict the company from making\n\nany investment whatsoever in the photovoltaic venture.\n\nThe absolute barriers can be thought of as being more defini\xc2\xad\ntive in their results in that they either allow an investment\n\nconsideration to proceed forward, or it rejects it entirely. The\n\nsecondary barriers tend to be more a matter of degree and center\n\naround the form of the investment.\n\nThere are basically two\n\nABSOLUTE AND SECONDARY BARRIERS\nabsolute barriers, one being low financial reward, the second being\n\nmarkets, products, or customers are not compatible with present\n\ncompany objectives. While there are several government programs that\n\ncould be developed to reduce the low perceived financial reward\n\nbarrier, there are few if any that can be developed for the perceived\n\nbarrier of incompatibility with the photovoltaic venture.\n\nThe secondary barriers include such items as:\n\n*\n..\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nHigh risk--technology\n\nHigh risk--market\n\nAttitude toward government presence\n\nCompetitive environment\n\nInstitutional issues\n\nBalance of systems cost\n\n\nExcept for the govermnent presence issue, virtually all of these\n\nperceived barriers can be positively influenced through various\n\ngovernment actions.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL GOVERNMENT ACTIONS\n\nThere are many incentives that the government can use to\n\ninduce industry into investment areas. Each of these incentives can\n\nalso have a large number of variations such that their design can\n\nmeet the special needs of each participating company. Extreme care\n\nmust be taken, however, in their design in that they can easily bias\n\nthe direction in which the market develops and selectively enhance\n\nand discourage specific companies.\n\nIn any\n\nDIRECT GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES AT FUNDAMENTAL BARRIERS\nventure, it is easy to identify those companies tnat would appear to\n\nbe the most logical to participate in that venture, and it is also\n\neasy to design policies and programs around those companies. Through\n\nsuch policy designs, these companies become heavily involved in the\n\n\n30\n\nGnostc Concepts, Inc\n\nventure. It appears as though the policies were properly designed\n\nand attracted the proper companies. However, if the incentives had\n\nbeen designed to reduce barriers to investments, then it may have\n\nbeen found that a broader spectrum of better-qualified companies\n\ncould have become involved in the venture.\n\nIt is thus critical and important that the government incen\xc2\xad\ntives be developed with care. In relationship to the photovoltaic\n\nventure, the most obvious companies to be involved would be the\n\nsemiconductor-based companies. The technology for the photovoltaic\n\nventure is based upon the same technology and manufacturing tech\xc2\xad\nniques that have made the semiconductor venture so successful in this\n\ncountry. The semiconductor industry has associated with it, however,\n\nmany deficits that will have to be overcome in some fashion to meet\n\nall of the requirements of the future photovoltaic industry.\n\nThere are other industry-type companies that have far greater\n\nassets available to be devoted to the photovoltaic venture than do\n\nthe semiconductor companies. Even within those companies, there are\n\nsome serious deficits which must be overcome. In order for the\n\ngovernment not to bias the market toward the semiconductor industry\n\nor retard or eliminate some valuable resources in other companies,\n\nthe government incentives must be carefully designed and directed at\n\nfundamental barriers to investments across the entire US industrial\n\ncomplex.\n\nCOMPROMISING OF RESTRICTIONS REQUIRED\nPreparing incentives\n\nnot to bias the market and at the same time meet other boundary\n\nconditions, such as fostering small business or not overpowering\n\nnormal market driving forces and competitive influences, will be\n\nvirtually impossible. A compromise of all of these aspects is the\n\nbest that can be accomplished.\n\nNEGATIVE ACTIONS SHOULD BE AVOIDED\nThere are also negative\n\ngovernment actions that can bias the market away from certain types\n\nof companies and toward others. This could discourage investments\n\nfrom some of the better-equipped companies. Such a negative action\n\nwould be that of imposing restrictions on the participation of\n\npetrochemical-based firms within the photovoltaic venture, or not\n\nrecognizing other nonsemiconuctor-based companies would be seriously\n\ninterested in the photovoltaic venture. Such companies would be\n\nthose associated with thin-film technologies, equipment manufac\xc2\xad\nturers, controls companies, glass and lead producers, and other\n\nindustrial firms.\n\nOther negative actions that must be guarded against are the\n\nimplementation of legislation that dictates performance versus cost\n\ncriteria. This is an area that should be left to the ingenuity and\n\nresponsibility of private industry. Legislation must be implemented,\n\nhowever, to protect the public, but it should not dictate product\n\ndesign or performance criteria. It should, however, determine\n\n\n23Cnosti\n\nConcepts Inc\n\n31\n\nstandards of how performance can be measured and should include\n\ncertain minimum aspects, such as building code requirements and\n\nsafety aspects. Once government pursuit of performance versus cost\n\ncriteria is evident, then industrial concerns will begin to lose\n\ninterest in the venture, as they will feel they have lost control of\n\ntheir own destiny.\n\nLONG-TERM GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT NEEDED\nSince the\n\nphotovoltaic venture is a long-range venture, then it would be\n\ndetrimental to the acceleration of the industrialization process for\n\nthe government to pursue programs and policies based on only one-year\n\ncommitments. Multiple-year commitments must be established in all\n\nincentives. Government commitments on a one-year basis do not allow\n\nfor the gaining of confidence on the part of industrial companies\n\nthat the government will be supportive of the photovoltaic venture\n\nin the following years. There must be longer-term commitments on\n\nthe part of the government if long-term commitments are expected from\n\nindustry, especially if the government\'s objective is to cause\n\ninvestments to occur sooner than they would normally. Thus, an\n\nexcellent incentive based on too short a time span will be far less\n\neffective.\n\nAVAILABLE INCENTIVES\nToIllowing:\n\n*\n*\na\n*\n*\n*\ne\n@\na\n*\no\n\nThe available incentives include the\n\n\nSubsidize photovoltaic research and development\n\nSubsidize prices\n\nGuarantee market\n\nExperimental and demonstration projects\n\nMarket studies\n\nGovernment-furnished equipment\n\nManagement fee\n\nProduction demonstration\n\nEnd-user financial assistance\n\nSupplier tax preference\nLoan guarantees to photovoltaic investors\n\n\nMIXED REACTIONS WILL OCCUR TO ANY GOVERNMENT INCENTIVE\n\nAn incentive designed at reducing investment barriers will be\n\nreceived differently by different companies, even within a similar\n\nindustrial grouping. Each company has its own particular require\xc2\xad\nments and viewpoints of the height of the barriers to the investment.\n\nTwo companies within the same industrial grouping with the same\n\nbarriers will react differently to the same incentive because the\n\nbarriers to investment will be perceived differently.\n\nThe difference in perspective ,of each of the investment\n\nbarriers will vary due to differences in management style, philosophy\n\nof management, the available resources, their relationship to the\n\ngovernment, previous investments, and investments that are competing\n\nfor the resources of the company.\n\n\n32\n\n2\n\nCnostc Conceps Inc\n\nTo meet the wide variability that exists within the American\n\nindustrial complex, a group of incentives will have to be developed.\n\nNo one or two incentives will accomplish the goals of the indus\xc2\xad\ntrialization project. Not only will several parallel incentives have\n\nto be implemented, but there will also have to be a sequential\n\napplication of incentives to account for the ever-changing conditions\n\nthat will face prospective and present investors.\n\n\nGnotic Concepts, Inc\n\n33\n\n2.Study Objectives\n2.1\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nOF\n\nPURPOSE\n\n\nThe industrialization of the photovoltaic venture refers to\n\nthe commitment of resources on the part of industrial concerns in\n\nconnection with implementing low-cost, high-production manufacturing\n\ntechniques, procedures, and technologies to produce photovoltaic\n\nproducts. There are a number of options available to the government\n\nin the pursuit of industrialization.\n\nIn addition, there is a perceived need on the part of the\n\ngovernment to accelerate this industrialization process. The reason\n\nfor this study is to develop a detailed understanding of the\n\ndecision process by which industrial concerns evaluate investment\n\nventures in photovoltaics manufacturing.\n\nThe intended use of such a detailed understanding of the\n\ninvestment process would be to provide a framework by which the\n\nvarious government alternatives could be evaluated as to their\n\nlikely influence upon stimulating or accelerating the industriali\xc2\xad\nzation process. The ultimate objective is, then, to provide a rank\n\nordering of the various available government options and tne\n\nreasoning as to their perceived influence.\n\n\nk""EtWCoPlnBLANK \n\nN3\n\n\n0cnosrlc Concepts Inc\n\n35\n\n2.2\n\nTA SK\n\n0 B J E C T I V E S\n\n\nParticular attention was paid to the influence on the invest\xc2\xad\nment decision of perceived financial reward, technical risks, and\n\nmarket risks associated with the photovoltaic venture. In addition,\n\nthere had to be considerations made for the manner in which these\xc2\xad\nperceived rewards and risks could be affected by rapid technological\n\nadvances, successful or unsuccessful demonstrations of production or\n\napplication technologies, and alternative government policies for\n\nindustry stimulation.\n\nThe pursuit of the objectives of this study was divided into\n\nfour basic task functions. A description of those tasks is as\n\nfollows:\n\n@ Task 1--Industry Description and Potential Entrance Analysis\n\nConduct an extensive industry interview program focused on\n\ncompanies which are presently participating in the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaics market or which, because of their technology and\n\npast interest, could enter the market in the future.\n\nParticular attention was to be devoted to major semi\xc2\xad\nconductor companies which have not yet committed resources\n\nto photovoltaics, as well as the US energy industry. All\n\nnecessary precautions were to be taken to prevent dis\xc2\xad\nclosure of information proprietary to individual companies.\n\n* Task 2--Investment Decision Analysis\n\nIntegrate and condense into a usable, representative set\n\nthe definable investment decision processes determined to\n\nexist in the companies interviewed in Task 1. Develop\n\ntypical company groupings that represent the spectrum of\n\npresent and potential photovoltaic suppliers. Identify\n\nfrom these groupings barriers to photovoltaic investments\n\nperceived to exist by potential entrants. Identify any\n\nadditional barriers restricting expansion of present-day\n\nproducers. Interpret the representative set of decision\n\nprocesses and perceived barriers as they influence invest\xc2\xad\nment decisions.\n\n* Task 3--Industrialization Policy Design\n\nSelect criteria for the evaluation of alternative govern\xc2\xad\nment policies for stimulating the photovoltaics industry.\n\nApply these criteria to a JPL-furnished list of government\n\npolicies and programs. Prepare a preliminary rank ordering\n\nof these programs. Perform any resurveying necessary of\n\nselected companies to obtain their attitudes toward the\n\n\n36\n\nE Gnostic Concepts Inc\n\nprograms and policies as a calibration of the evaluation.\n\ncriteria. Incorporate results of the resurvey into a final\n\nrank ordering to be recommended to JPL.\n\n* Task 4--Industrialization Measurement Criteria\n\nDevelop from the understanding of investment decision\n\nproceses gained in previous tasks the conceptual framework\n\nnecessary to monitor the commitment of industry resources\n\nto photovoltaic manufacturing. Define a set of leading\n\nindicators and recommend corresponding procedures to permit\n\nmeasurement in real time for the performances of this\n\nmonitoring function.\n\n\nGnosck Concepts.

None of these descriptions\n\nrelate to the decision process or the characterization of how risk\n\nis evaluated and dealt with in a venture decision.\n\nTo understand the process by which companies arrive at an\n\ninvestment decision, a description of a company\'s business position\n\nis needed that relates to the characteristics and elements of a\n\nventure investment. One such description is portrayed in Figure 3.1.\n\nThe origin of the three-dimensional figure represents the present-day\n\nbusiness position of a company in regard to:\n\na Major markets served\n\n* Product available\n\na Technology base\n\nAny new business investment involves decisions concerning\n\nchanges in these three major aspects of the company\'s present status.\n\nThe degree of change in each element will vary, depending on the\n\nnature and size of the proposed investment. In effect, the invest\xc2\xad\nment would cause a change in the company\'s business position or\n\nstatus. Conversely, a change in business position will require an\n\ninvestment in at least one of these three major company business\n\naspects.\n\n\nf ORC\nEDING FACE\n\nCnotkc Concepts Inc\n\nN.O\n\n:4Ajt\xc2\xad\n39INK\n\n39\n\nFIGURE 3.1\nCHANGE IN BUSINESS POSITION\n\nTechnology\nBose\n\n....O...,\xe2\x80\xa2......,.............\n\n,\n\nI\n\nPostniton\n....................\n\n..\n\nPreont\n\nBwinez\n\n"\n\nNew Busines\nDesired\n\n\n,\nA aor\n\nPositl n\nServed\n\nI\n\n... .\n\nW...................\xe2\x80\xa2...\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nDeveloorrent\n\n\nIn general, any\n\nALL COMPANIES FACE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE\ncompany entering the photovoltaic industry will be changing its\n\nbusiness position, since in most cases no previous activity would\n\nhave existed in the photovoltaic area. Consequently, this calls for\n\ninvolvement in new markets using new products built with new tech\xc2\xad\nnologies that were probably not employed by the company prior to\n\nentering the photovoltaic industry.\n\nFor companies in the photovoltaic industry, the expected\n\nchanges in the photovoltaic industry will cause a change in their\n\npresent business position. This will involve investments in product\n\ndevelopment, the establishment of new technologies, and in many cases\n\ninclude moving into new matkets not presently served.\n\nIn the sections that follow, descriptions will be given of\n\nthe impact and the significance of investments required in various\n\ncombinations of these three basic elements of a business position.\n\nDistinction will be made between an enlargement of the present\n\nbusiness position through larger market share of present markets and\n\nmoving a company via investment to a new position involving change\n\nin the three major business aspects.\n\n\n40\n\n2\n\nCno tic Concep\n\nInc\n\n0\n\nRISKS INVOLVED\n\nA change in a company\'s business position includes the\n\ndecision to invest, the actual capitalization of that investment,\n\nand an evaluation of risks. For any type of change in company\n\nposition, there are always risks. These are the elements of the\n\ninvestment that cannot necessarily be quantitatively or analytically\n\ndescribed. Judgment, courage, and determination on the part of the\n\ninvesting company are often required to arrive at a decision.\n\nRISKS INCREASE IN PROPORTION TO CHANGES REQUIRED\n\nRisks increase rapidly as the change in company position involves\n\nincreasing components of each of the major business aspects. Changes\n\nin a business position that involve only one of the three aspects\n\nhave lower risk as compared to changes in two or three major aspects\n\nof the business position. In each of the sections that follow, a\n\nseparate discussion will be included on the implications of the risks\n\nassociated with the proposed investment. Various methods of handling\n\nand evaluating risks will also be discussed.\n\nRISKS INVOLVE LOST OPPORTUNITY AND OUTSIDE INFLUENCES\n\nRisks not only involve the potential loss of the investment that is\n\nbeing proposed, but often include an evaluation of lost opportunities\n\nin other areas. There is no guarantee that a lost alternative would\n\nhave been any more successful than the venture implemented. Thus\n\njudgment, perspective, and experience are elements that come to play\n\nin the investment decision in evaluating risks. In general, the more\n\nthere is to be gained from a successful investment, the more there\n\nis to be lost if failure occurs.\n\nThe evaluation of risks also includes consideration of factors\n\ninfluencing the outcome of the investment that may not be under\n\ndirect control of the company. Government regulations may be a\n\nsignificant influence upon the development of a market, and yet often\n\nno accurate forecast can be made of future government regulations.\n\nSuch risk factors must be evaluated on a sensitivity basis, in which\n\nseveral scenarios are developed on outside influences and the\n\nresultant impacts upon potential success of the investment. Even\n\nwith these sensitivity analyses, risk is often in the final decision\n\nevaluated strictly on a judgmental basis by the company senior staff.\n\n\nSGnotic Concepts\n\nInc.\n\n41\n\n3.2\n\nI M P AC T O F\nDECISIONS\n\nEACH\n\nD I M E N SI 0 N\n\nO N\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe following sections describe investments in a one- or\n\ntwo-dimensional movement to a new company position and their\n\nimplications. Many investments move a company along only one of the\n\nthree major axes describing a company\'s business position. Two\xc2\xad\ndimensional movements are also common but are usually associated\n\nwith higher-risk investments.\n\nThe objective of these descriptions is to isolate individual\n\ndimensions and to emphasize critical points concerning investments\n\nalong those single avenues. This will set the background for dealing\n\nwith investments in all three dimensions at one time, which typically\n\ncharacterizes present-day investments in the photovoltaic industry.\n\nFrom these discussions will evolve the dominant characteristics of\n\npresent-day investment philosophies and an explanation of how risk\n\nis dealt with in the investment decision process. Appropriate\n\ndefinitions and examples will be inserted to relate to present-day\n\npractices. Their intent is to illustrate the concepts being\n\npresented.\n\n\nMAJOR\n\nMARKETS\n\nSER VED\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nFor the purposes of this report, major markets have been\n\ndefined in broad terms, as exemplified in Table 3.1. This cate\xc2\xad\ngorization includes not only markets served by electronic firms,\n\nsemiconductor firms, chemical firms, and equipment suppliers, but\n\nalso markets that potential photovoltaic suppliers will service in\n\nthe near future or in the far term.\n\nNot all of these markets can be served by every type of\n\nelectronic, industrial, or photovoltaic firm. Each supplier of\n\nproducts or services has in general selected major markets found to\n\noffer the greatest opportunities. This is by no means a stagnant\n\nsituation. Each company is constantly seeking new market areas in\n\nwhich they may participate that involve as low a risk and investment\n\nas possible. The more dynamic companies will, however, be seeking\n\nout opportunities in more of the major markets than the lesser\n\ndynamic companies. In addition, they will be pursuing a more\n\naggressive expansion of their influence within presently-served\n\nmarkets.\n\n\n42\n\nF= c5ttc Concets, inc\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n\nTABLE 3.1\nREPRESENTATIVE MAJOR MARKETS AND APPLICATION AREAS\n\nELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT\n\nELECTRICAL/INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT\nBUSINESS/RETAIL\n\nHOUSING &CONSTRUCTION\n\nCONSTRUCTION\nPRIVATE\nOILTCE MOIPMIM\nBUILDINS\nRESIDENTIAL\nS\nWORD\nPROCSING\nUNITS\nNEW\nFAMILY\nTYPEWRITER\n&\nADDITIONS ALTERATIONS\nMACHINT\nCALC/ADD\nNo-jOJ5EPIN\nDESKTOP\nNONRES.

Many examples of applications within a given\n\nmarket are listed in Table 3.1. For each application there may be\n\nmany different customers, all within a given major market. Extension\n\nof products and services to new customers can occur within a given\n\nmajor market segment. Expansion of services and products to new\n\ncustomers is not considered to be an investment into new market\n\nareas.\n\nThe same product or service may be applied to a new applica\xc2\xad\ntion and to a new customer as well as to a new market. An investment\n\nin the one-dimensional direction of new markets served would not\n\ninclude any investment to be made in new products or new technolo\xc2\xad\ngies. Thus in the context of this report, a new market served auto\xc2\xad\nmatically requires new customers and possibly new applications but\n\ndoes not necessarily imply that new products or new technologies are\n\nrequired.\n\nMARKET RELATIONSHIP TO PHOTOVOLTAICS\nNot all of the markets\n\nidentified in Table 3.1 can be served by photovoltaic products. To\n\nrelate the concept of markets to the photovoltaic investment venture,\n\nselected markets in which photovoltaics have reasonable penetration\n\npotentials are shown in Table 3.2, along with typical applications\n\ntherein. For instance, the communications industry, especially\n\nremote repeater sites for communication channels, represents an\n\nexcellent opportunity for photovoltaic products. The cathodic\n\nprotection market also holds potential for photovoltaic products in\n\nwell-head and pipeline applications.\n\nRELATIONSHIP OF BUSINESS ASPECTS TO PHOTOVOLTAICS\n\nThe relationship between business position and major markets is\n\ndemonstrated in Figure 3.2. Here the hierarchy of markets and\n\napplications, products, and technology are shown in their perspective\n\nas they relate to photovoltaics.\n\nAt the base of the hierarchy are photovoltaic technology\n\naspects involved in assembly of photovoltaic panels or concentrator\n\nunits, along with technologies of solar cell devices and materials\n\ninvolved. In general, this is the highest technology portion of the\n\nhierarchy.\n\nThe photovoltaic product aspects begin with the assembly of\n\nphotovoltaic panels into photovoltaic arrays. Arrays are then\n\ncoupled together with other components, including batteries, power\n\nconditioning, physical structures, and electrical interconnections,\n\nto form a solar power supply.\n\n\n44\n\nGnostk Concepts.

Such functional units would include water pumps,\n\nmicrowave repeater sites, battery chargers, or special products such\n\nthat the end result is a functioning unit that performs a useful\n\nservice.\n\nThese photovoltaic products can then be applied to various\n\napplications within many market segments. A given product may be\n\napplied to several applications within one market segment or may be\n\nused in applications throughout several major markets. In general,\n\na photovoltaic product will have been designed for a specific appli\xc2\xad\ncation within a given market, but through only slight modifications\n\nmay find suitable application within other major market segments.\n\n\n46\n\nF\n\nGnostic Concepts. Inc\n\nINCREASED SHARE OF PRESENT MARKETS SERVED USING ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS\n\nAND TECHNOLOGY BASE\n\nResources are often devoted to the concept of increasing a\n\ncompany\'s share of presently served markets. In the sense of this\n\nreport, this is not truly a movement along any of the three major\n\naxes, but a redefinition of the origin of the business position. It\n\ncould, however, under a selected set of conditions, be construed as\n\na minor movement along the major markets served axis, as shown in\n\nFigure 3.3.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.3\nINCREASED SHARE OF MARKET\n\nTechnology\n\nBase\n\nPresent\nBusiness\nPosition-..\n\nNew Business\nPosition Desired\n\nMajor\nMarkets\nServed\n\nProduct\nDeveloornent\n\nREPRESENTS LOW RISK\nThe risk involved in making this move\xc2\xad\nment is relatively low. Only minor investments need to be made,\n\npossibly an increase in the marketing staff or a slight increase in\n\nproduction if increased penetration is obtained. It does not include\n\na risk in product development or in the development of a new tech\xc2\xad\nnology, or even the risk of learning to do business in different\n\nmarket areas.\n\n\n2\n\nGnostic Concepts, Inc.\n\n47\n\nIMPLEMENTATION METHODS\nIncaeasing market share could involve\n\n-nothing more than a lowering of product prices. The risk involved\n\nrelates to the market price elasticity characteristics. If a reduc\xc2\xad\ntion in price does not provide a significantly increased share of\n\nmarket, then the risk involved with price reductions was misjudged,\n\nresulting in lost profits. If the price elasticity estimates were\n\ncorrect, potentially large gains could be made through a simple\n\nprice reduction.\n\nAnother example of implementing such a movement is special\n\nselection or categorizing of end products, such that higher prices\n\ncould be exacted for the higher-quality portion of the product\n\ndistribution. This, of course, assumes that the marketplace is\n\nwilling to pay a higher price for a perceived increase in quality of\n\nproduct. This could lead to a larger share of at least the higher\n\nprofit margin portion of the marketplace.\n\nA third approach to increasing market share may be to increase\n\nthe service aspect associated with supplying markets. Involvement\n\nof applications engineers with end-users, for example, could very\n\nwell increase market penetration within those given applications.\n\nThe product supplier performs some function for the end-user that\n\nwould otherwise absorb end-user resources. In return, the end-user\n\nwould purchase additional products from or pay higher prices to the\n\nsupplier.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIncreasing market share in the context of this\n\nreport is considered a conservative approach to business enlargement\n\nor a repositioning of a company\'s business posture. It involves\n\nlittle risk and virtually no investment in most cases. It is not\n\ntypically characteristic of a new business venture, nor does it\n\nusually require a venture analysis.\n\n\nNEW MARKETS SERVED USING ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY BASE\n\nBy comparison to the previous example, this is a much more\n\naggressive change in a company\'s business position, but is still a\n\none-dimensional movement, as shown in Figure 3.4. By definition,\n\nthis change involves enlarging a marketing staff and the development\n\nof new customers in entirely new market segments. Methods of doing\n\nbusiness may be entirely different than from presently served\n\nmarkets. A company entering a new market segment often cannot cause\n\na change in the way business is done. Therefore, they must learn\n\nthe proper procedures, channels of distribution, and conform to them\n\nin order to be successful.\n\n\n48\n\n2\n\nGnosti Concepts Inc\n\nFIGURE 3.4\n\nNEW MARKETS SERVED USING ESTABLISHED\n\nPRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nTechnology\n\nBase\n\n\nPresent\nBusiness\n\nPosition ------\n\n:0\nNew Business\nPosition Desired\n\nMajor\n\nMarkets\nServed\n\nProduct\nDevelopment\n\nPENETRATION LIMITED BY PRODUCTS\nCompanies are constantly\n\nseeking new markets for their products.

It involves\n\ntaking the present-day products and the technologies on which they\n\nare based and moving them into new market areas, new applications,\nand new customers. Penetration into these new markets can be limited\ndue to products not being optimally designed for the applications\nand the requirements of these new market areas.\n\nAn example is two-way communication equipment for the merchant\n\nmarine marketplace. A decision may be made within a company to\n\nsupply product to the aviation industry. Limited penetration will\n\noccur because the products for the merchant marine marketplace may\n\nnot be packaged appropriately to fit the physical restrictions of an\n\naircraft. This assumes only minor adjustments are needed for proper\n\nfrequency ranges and other electronic requirements. Consequently,\n\npenetration will be limited because of the product.\n\n\nC Gnostic Concepts, Inc\n\n49\n\nMICROPROCESSOR TYPIFIES CONCEPT\nThere are, however, many\n\nsuccessful business ventures that involve the penetration of new\n\nmarkets with present-day products. An example of this is micro\xc2\xad\nprocessdr circuits developed by the semiconductor industry for use\n\nin the computer market segment. It has been found that these\n\nproducts can be moved into the consumer electronics market with\n\nlittle change. Applications in consumer electronics include\n\ncalculators, video games, microwave oven controls, etc.\n\nSignificant growth for microprocessors has occurred within\n\nthe consumer electronics industry. Semiconductor companies have\n\nincreased customer base, revenues, and shown substantial growth\n\nthrough the application of a standard product to a new market\n\nsegment.\n\n\nNEW MARKETS SERVED WITH NEW PRODUCTS USING ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGIES\n\nTo enhance the potential for penetrating new markets, it is\n\noften required that new products be developed for the specific\n\nrequirements of these markets. This is an extremely common occurrence\n\nwithin the semiconductor industry and requires in essence no new\n\ntechnologies, only a redesign of products around new application\n\nspecifications. This approach is driven by participation first in\n\nnew markets with established products, followed by the generation of\n\nnew products designed for that market, as depicted in Figure 3.5.\n\nRISKS INCREASE WITH INTRODUCTION OF SECOND BUSINESS ASPECT\n\nThe risks involved in this approach are obviously much higher than\n\nsimply the introduction of a standard product into a new marketplace.\n\nHere an investment must be made into a new product as well as\n\nlearning how to do business in new marketplaces.\n\nIn many cases, the knowledge of application requirements in a\n\nnew market may be lacking within a company. Consequently, the risks\n\nare increased that the product design for this application may be\n\nlacking some unique characteristic. In the development of a custom\n\nproduct for these conditions, there is also a risk that large-scale\n\nproduction orders that allow for the recouping of investment costs\n\nwill not materialize.\n\nSUCCESS ALLOWS SIGNIFICANT GROWTH\nHowever, if success is\n\naccomplished through this new product design for new markets, then\n\nsignificant growth in a company\'s business posture can result. In\n\naddition, the new products may bring insight into design character\xc2\xad\nistics for older products that would provide enhanced performance\n\nfor the same price or even a reduced price, thus allowing increased\n\nmarket share in the older markets.\n\n\n50\n\n2\n\nCnostic Concepts, Inc.\n\nFIGURE 3.5\nNEW MARKETS SERVED WITH NEW PRODUCTS\nUSING ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGIES\nTechnology\n\nBase\n\nPresent\nBusiness\nPosition-~\n\nMajor\nMarkets\nServed\n\nNew Business\n\nPosition Desired\n\n\nProduct\n\nDevelopment\n\n\nRISKS IN PROPORTION TO POTENTIAL\nThe desire to penetrate\n\nnew markets is the driving force behind the development of new\n\nproducts. If effective market penetration could be accomplished with\n\nestablished products, there would be no need to risk the development\n\nof new products. Judgment factors in estimating the potential of\n\nnew markets, determining requirements for the development of\n\nproducts, and assessing whether or not large production orders can\n\nbe obtained are involved in the risk evaluations that must be made\n\nin such a venture analysis. The market evaluation includes judgments\n\non the price elasticity of markets, their ultimate sizes, and who\n\nthe competition is. What do they offer that is unique or desirable\n\nto the end-user? Can new product concepts be brought to fruition in\n\nsufficient time to offset any development that the established\n\nsuppliers in these new markets may be contemplating? What influence\n\nwill an end-user\'s loyalty to present suppliers have upon the poten\xc2\xad\ntial for penetration by a new supplier? Thus with the higher\n\npotential associated with high growth rates through this approach,\n\nthere are also higher risks involved.\n\n\n2Cnosrkc Concepts. Inc\n\n51\n\nMARKET RISKS DOMINATE OVER PRODUCT RISKS\n\nGenerally, the\n\n\nrisks associated with the development of the new products is not as\n\nhigh as those associated with evaluating the potentials and the\n\ncharacteristics of the new markets. A company generally knows its\n\ninternal capabilities very well and has confidence in its design and\n\ndevelopment groups, as well as knowing the capabilities of its\n\nproduction staff to gear up for a new product. There are many\n\naspects, as previously pointed out, in the evaluation of the market\n\ncharacteristics that cannot be determined from industry statistics.\n\nThe risks associated with the product development can, however, be\n\nmore analytically examined. Those risks associated with the new\n\nmarkets to be served are generally in the qualitative area and must\n\nrely upon judgments and insufficient quantitative data.\n\n\nNEW MARKETS SERVED WITH ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES\n\nAnother possible method of penetrating new markets is to use\n\nestablished products and technologies followed by the introduction\n\nof new technologies. By definition, there is no change in product\n\ncharacteristics in this case. Arrival at this new business position\n\nis depicted in Figure 3.6.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6\n\n\nNEW MARKETS SERVED WITH ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS\nUSING NEW TECHNOLOGIES\nTechnology\n\n\nBase\n\n\nNew Business\nPosition Desred\n\nPresent\nBusiness\nPosition\n\n-0-\n\n7\n\nMajor\nMarkets\nServed\n\nProduct\nDevelooment\n\n\n52\n\n2Gnostc Concepts Inc\n\nCONCEPT NOT A PRACTICAL ONE\nThis is an unusual case\n\nhowever. The concept of changing a basic technology without any\n\nchange in product characteristics offers no significant advantage to\n\neither the supplier or the user.\n\nNew markets will be serviced by what appears to the end-user\n\nto be the same product that was available prior to the development\n\nof the new technology. The manufacturer must invest in new tech\xc2\xad\nnology, yet if it does not produce any significant new character\xc2\xad\nistics in the product, he has accomplished very little for the high\n\ninvestment risk in developing the new technology. Since there is no\n\nchange in the product characteristics, the new markets to be served\n\nwill see no advantage or may not even redognize that a new technology\n\nis involved. It will certainly pay no premium for the fact that it\n\nis a new technology and, in fact, may want to pay a lower price, as\n\nthere will be a lack of field data and reliability information\n\nconcerning this product using a new technology. It may be more\n\ndifficult to increase penetration or remain viable in the new markets\n\nwith products using the new technology than it would using estab\xc2\xad\nlished old technology products that have behind them reliability data\n\nand a number of field examples to demonstrate the product\'s\n\ncharacteristics.\n\nIn summary, the concept of a new business position involving\n\nnew markets, followed by new technologies, but resulting in no\n\nrecognizable product changes may not be\'a practical one. In fact,\n\nno examples of companies making such decisions is readily available\n\nor commonly known. Thus, while this new business position may exist\n\nin theory or within the context of the concepts presented here, in\n\nreality it appears to have no solid foundation to support that it\n\nactually exists.\n\nAPPROACH RESULTS IN USELESS TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT\n\nThis change in business position could be typified by the hypotheti\xc2\xad\ncal case in which a semiconductor company is servicing a given set\n\nof new markets using bipolar technology. To increase penetration of\n\nnew markets, the company invests in the development of an MOS tech\xc2\xad\nnology that is then applied to their products. The semiconductor\n\ncompany will have made the investment in developing the new MOS\n\ntechnology, which requires tremendous resources and new manufacturing\n\ntechniques, but yet will offer no change in product characteristics\n\nto increase penetration of the new markets. It appears to be almost\n\na useless investment in technology development, as it will offer\n\nlittle if any advantage to the end-user. The only possible gain is\n\nthat as a result of the new technology, production costs can be\n\nsubstantially reduced. This would allow price reductions and\n\npossibly some associated increase in market penetration.\n\n\n2Gnstk Concep\n\nInc\n\n53\n\nBesides being an almost useless investment in technology,\n\nthere is little chance that the implementation of a new technology\n\nto old products can be accomplished without noticeable changes in\n\nproduct characteristics. Thus, arriving at this conceived new\n\nbusiness position would be almost impossible, even if it were so\n\ndesired.\n\n\nPRODUCT\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nProducts are those physical items which a company ships to a\n\nuser through various distribution channels and in return receives\n\nsome financial payment or reward. The customer which receives these\n\nproducts may or may not be the ultimate end-user. The products may\n\nbe combined with other components or other products to form a more\n\ncomplex or a higher value added end-product that is then distributed\n\nto end-users.\n\nThe number of intermediate handlers of the products can vary\n\nfrom zero to three or four independent operations. Generally, as\n\nthese products move through the various channels of distribution,\n\nthe handlers of these products either provide services or additional\n\nproducts that are combined with the original product to enhance the\n\nultimate function or benefit that is provided to the end-user.\n\nPHOTOVOLTAIC AND SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS AS EXAMPLES\n\nA typical product supplied by photovoltaic companies will be flat:\n\nplate photovoltaic panels which are then combined with other\n\ncomponents or products, such as batteries, structural material, power\n\nconditioning equipment, and electrical interconnection material, to\n\nprovide a photovoltaic power supply. This in itself is a product,\n\nbut even this product will ultimately be combined with some other\n\npiece of equipment, such as a microwave relay tower or a water pump,\n\nto provide a functional product for some end-user.\n\nIn the case of the semiconductor industry, typical products\n\nwould include the microprocessor, the random-access memory circuit,\n\na read-only memory circuit, logic gates, operational amplifiers, and\n\ndiscrete semiconductor components. In addition to these basic\n\nproducts, the semiconductor industry also offers higher-level\n\nproducts which result from the combining of various semiconductor\n\ndevices with other passive components, such as resistors and capaci\xc2\xad\ntors, on printed circuit boards. These products are basically func\xc2\xad\ntional products that fit into subsystems. Some semiconductor\n\ncompanies have integrated their operation such that these functional\n\nproduct boards are combined to form subsystems and subsystems are\n\ncombined to produce end-products such as minicomputers or full-scale\n\ncomputers.\n\n\n54\n\nCno~tlc Concepts, Inc\n\nBASIC ELEMENTS OF PRODUCTS\nelements:\n\n\nProducts have three basic\n\n\n* Design\n\n* Packaging\n\n* Manufacturing processes and techniques\n\nIn the semiconductor industry, the design element relates primarily\n\nto the circuit design and the physical layout of the semiconductor\n\nchip. The packaging element relates to the material and configura\xc2\xad\ntion of the external package within which the semiconductor chip has\n\nbeen mounted and interconnected through appropriate lead mechanisms.\n\nProvisions must also be made for outside electrical contact to the\n\nproduct. The manufacturing processes and techniques associated with\n\nsemiconductor products deal with variations within the manufacturing\n\noperation for chips, packaging, and the final testing of the product.\n\nWithin each of the manufacturing operations, there are a\n\nseries of subtechnologies, processes, and manufacturing techniques\n\nthat make up the overall technology base. Examples of subtechnolo\xc2\xad\ngies are gold or aluminum wire bonding in the assembly operation and\n\nthe use of negative or positive photoresist in device manufacture.\n\nFurther discussion of the concept of technology will follow.\n\nFor the moment, it will be assumed that a series of subtechnologies,\n\nprocesses, and manufacturing techniques combine to form the basic\n\noverall technology that is used in manufacturing products. The\n\nsignificant point is that changes and evolutions in the subtechnolo\xc2\xad\ngies, processes, and manufacturing techniques do not necessarily\n\nconstitute a major change in the basic technology used by a company.\n\nPRODUCTS EASIEST BUSINESS ASPECT TO QUANTITATIVELY DESCRIBE\n\nGenerally speaking, products are the easiest of the three major\n\naspects of a company\'s business to define quantitatively and to\n\nanalyze accurately. Products can be described through specifica\xc2\xad\ntions, material content, and performance characteristics. Variations\n\nin these specifications can be directly related to financial invest\xc2\xad\nments and the required resources that must be brought together to\n\nformulate the change. Performance characteristics of products are\n\ngenerally the most difficult to guarantee early in the investment\n\ndecision process. However, a significant amount of accumulated\n\nexperience is usually available within the design and manufacturing\n\nstaff to be able to effectively reduce the risk associated with\n\nmeeting ultimate performance requirements.\n\n\nCnosti Concepts Inc\n\n55\n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR PRESENT MARKETS USING ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGY\n\nBASE\n\nA common and continually evolving process within an industry\n\nis the development of new products for present markets using the\n\nestablished technology base within the company. This concept is\n\nshown in Figure 3.7. The intent is increased market share, to remain\n\ncompetitive, or to enhance the performance characteristics of the\n\nproduct line being supplied.\n\nFIGURE 3.7\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR PRESENT MARKETS\nUSING ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGY BASE\nTechnology\n\nBase\n\nPresent\nBusiness\nPosition\n\nMajor\nM\n\narketsC~\n\nServed\nNew Business\nosi ion Desired\n\nProduct\nDeve loornent\n\nDESIGN ELEMENT CHANGE MOST COMMON OCCURRENCE\nTypically, this\noevelopmenT taKes tne Torm oT a variacion on the design element as\nthe principal area of change. This is very typical of the semi\xc2\xad\nconductor industry. A read-only memory (ROM) is developed for a\n\ngiven series of applications. Through the variation of one or two\n\ndesign elements, a ROM can be designed for new applications within\n\npresently served markets or even new markets. It requires no change\n\nin the technology or the packaging concept but does enhance the\n\nvariation in the types of applications to which it can be applied.\n\n\n56\n\nGnosttc Concepts Inc\n\nPACKAGING AND MANUFACTURING CHANGE CAN PRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS\n\nA change in a semiconductor product\'s packaging concept would also\n\nconstitute product development. Through a reorientation of the\n\npackage leads, new applications could be serviced. The introduction\n\nof new packaging materials may substantially reduce product cost and\n\nallow a greater penetration of present markets. Repackaging may also\n\nallow the physical use of these products in areas not traditionally\n\nserved. Repackaging may increase cost, but at the same time increase\n\nreliability. This would allow it to be used in high-reliability\n\napplications, such as military or harsh environment applications.\n\nChanges in semiconductor manufacturing techniques and\n\nprocesses would generally be associated with attempting to increase\n\nthe throughput yield or reduce the overall cost of the product to\n\nehnance its penetration in present markets. Changes might include,\n\nfor instance, automation of a manual step to reduce cost, or it may\n\ninvolve minor changes in assembly and a side result of enhanced\n\nperformance. An example of this is a change in the temperature\n\nprofile of the ceiling furnace used in the final processing of a\n\nsemiconductor device. The end result might be higher yields plus a\n\nmore hermetically sealed product, thus increasing its reliability\n\nand desirability in many applications.\n\nPRODUCT CHANGES CAN CAUSE CHANGES AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES\n\nChanges in products also may result in the removing of labor from\n\nthe end-customer\'s facilities. As a result, the customer may be\n\nwilling to pay a somewhat higher price, as it reduces his cost for\n\nlabor. Sorting product through automatic testing procedures at the\n\nsupplier\'s facilities could result in the elimination of an expensive\n\nincoming manual inspection procedure at the user\'s facilities.\n\nRISKS ARE RELATIVELY LOW AND CAN BE PUT IN FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE\n\nThe risk associated with the development o--f\n\nproducts where no\n\nsignificant technology changes are associated is relatively low. As\n\npreviously mentioned, it can generally be analyzed in great detail.\n\nThe risk arises in properly evaluating the gains in the marketplace\n\nif such product development is implemented. The change in physical\n\nfacilities and the number of design engineers needed to accomplish\n\nthe product change, along with the scheduling of the new product and\n\nits introduction, is reasonably defined within a given manufacturer\'s\n\nfacility. His accumulated experience in introducing new products is\n\nrather large in most cases, and his ability to quantitatively analyze\n\nthe cost of such a venture is usually rather accurate. In summary,\n\nthe technical risks associated with product developments can easily\n\nbe put into financial perspective for the venture decision process.\n\n\n2\n\nCnostk concepts. Inc\n\n57\n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW MARKETS USING ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGY BASE\n\nThe concept of developing new products to penetrate new\n\nmarkets is very similar to the previous discussion of first entering\n\nnew markets and then developing new products to \'enhance penetration.\n\nIn that discussion, it was assumed that penetration was limited due\n\nto the limitations on the product. In this case, it is assumed that\n\nnew products must be developed first to even approach the new\n\nmarkets. The movement of a company into a new business position by\n\nthis route is shown in Figure 3.8.\n\nFIGURE 3.8\n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW MARKETS\n\nUSING ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGY BASE\n\nTechnology\n\nBase\n\n\nPresent\nBusiness\n\nPosition\n\n..\n\nMajor\ncm e\' s\n\n-.\n\nServed\nNew Business\nPosition Desired\n\nProduct\nDeveloornent\n\nMARKET REQUIREMENTS.DRIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nThis adds a\n\nsomewhat different perspective to the approach. The implication here\n\nis that the market has been so characterized as to indicate that\n\ncompetition is extremely fierce. To penetrate the market, a best\n\neffort must be set forth, which would require designing products\n\nspecifically dedicated to special requirements.\n\n\n58\n\nGnostk Concepts [nc\n\nIt would imply also that the dedication or loyalty of the\n\nend-users to the suppliers would be great and that it requires a\n\nsignificant increase in product performance characteristics or\n\nsignificant cost reductions in products to make a penetration of the\n\ngiven market segment. Entering these markets with established\n\nproducts would be looked upon as a feeble attempt and would demon\xc2\xad\nstrate a lack of understanding of the market characteristics by the\n\nsupplier. A long-range implication of that approach is that even if\n\na new product is ultimately developed, the supplier may have ruined\n\nhis reputation within that market by first attempting to sell an\n\ninadequate product.\n\nBOTH DESIGN AND PACKAGING CHANGE LIKELY TO OCCUR\nIn almost\n\nall cases, a variation in both the design and packaging elements will\n\nbe required to develop products for new markets. Again, these\n\nchanges in the product are not beyond the scope of quantitative\n\nanalysis. Thus the risks associated with such product developments\n\nare relatively low. Risks are encountered, again in the evaluation\n\nof the market characteristics, such as the price elasticity of demand\n\nand specific performance requirements.\n\nAUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY REQUIREMENTS TYPIFY CONCEPT\n\nThis approach to a new business position is typified by the circuits\n\nbeing developed for the automotive industry. Here the semiconductor\n\nindustry is using the same basic technologies that characterize their\n\npresent-day product lines. However, due to the special requirements\n\nof the harsh automotive environment, new packaging techniques must\n\nbe developed, along with variations in design to take into account\n\nthe special performance characteristics that the auomotive industry\n\nis seeking.\n\nOften this involves a custom circuit or a custom design.\n\nSupplying this product to the General Motors specification would in\n\nno way guarantee that it would meet a Chrysler specification.\n\nStandard products were not offered to the automotive industry because\n\nit was realized early that automotive requirements were unique in\n\nmany fashions. Design teams from the various semiconductor suppliers\n\nthus met with the design and specification personnel of the auto\xc2\xad\nmotive industry to develop custom products. These have evolved into\n\nlarge production contracts in several cases. Where standard products\n\nare being supplied to the automotive industry, it is generally asso\xc2\xad\nciated with other custom products specially designed to complement\n\nstandard products.\n\nAssociated with product development directed at the automotive\n\nindustry is the risk that no long-term contract would develop, as\n\nseveral suppliers were attempting to meet the same set of specifica\xc2\xad\nti-ons. In most cases, no product supplied met the entire specifica\xc2\xad\ntion, and consequently compromises had to be made in both the product\n\nperformance characteristics and the automotive specification. Thus\n\n\n9GnostTcConcepts, Inc\n\n59\n\nit was a race between competing companies to arrive at an acceptable\n\ncompromise position under the most attractive conditions for both\n\nthe supplier and the automotive manufacturer. Here the risks were\n\nsomewhat higher than in the previous cases mentioned because there\n\nwas less guarantee that the return on the design investment would\n\never be recouped.\n\n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR PRESENT MARKETS USING NEW TECHNOLOGY\n\nIntroducing a new technology into newly developed products\n\nfor an established market, as shown in Figure 3.9, does not offer a\n\nsignificant advantage to the supplier unless the new technology\n\nresults in significant performance improvement for the same price or\n\na substantial reduction in cost for the same performance character\xc2\xad\nistics. However, the combination of new technologies and new\n\nproducts could offer a significant opportunity for an increase in\n\nshare of market.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.9\n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR PRESENT MARKETS\n\nUSING NEW TECHNOLOGY BASE\n\nTechnology\nBase\n\nNew\nBusiness\n\nPosition\nDesired\n\nPresent\nMajor\n\'Aormets\nServed\n\nBusiness\n\nPosition\n\nProduct\n\nDeveloomnent\n\n\n60\n\n2\n\nGnostc Concepts, Inc\n\nThere are very few examples of products being developed first\n\nfor present markets, and then a new technology being introduced into\n\nthose products. (The reverse of that situation in which new tech\xc2\xad\nnologies are developed and then new products evolve out of the new\n\ntechnology base is quite common and will be discussed under the\n\nTechnology section.) Where there is a technology development element\n\ninvolved in arriving at a new business position, it is more often a\n\nsimultaneous development of technology and products rather than the\n\nserial development of first products and then new technologies.\n\nIn the case of the semiconductor industry, there was a\n\nsignifcant nmarket in the late 1950s for discrete semiconductor\n\nproducts. Around 1960, the planar process was developed. While this\n\ndid add some additional new products to the discrete area, its\n\ngreatest benefit resulted in the development of a whole new series\n\nof products called integrated circuits.\n\nWithin the photovoltaic industry, many new products will\n\nevolve to service established markets. However, when a significant\n\nnew technology base is introduced (for example, the production of\n\nthin silicon sheets), it will undoubtedly result in a new series of\n\nproducts. It will not be incorporated into just standard products\n\nwith very little product change. Product characteristics will\n\nchange, physical layout of the product will change, material content\n\nwill change, and probably performance characteristics will change.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nBASE\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nThe technology base of a given company, in broad terms, is\n\nthe collection of all of the subtechnologies, processes, and manu\xc2\xad\nfacturing techniques required to produce the company\'s products. In\n\ngeneral, there are selected elements within this collection that give\n\nthe technology base its predominant characteristics.\n\nThe semiconductor industry can be used to typify technology\n\ndefinitions and to distinguish between processes, manufacturing\n\ntechniques, and subtechnologies.\n\nA semiconductor production facility encompasses three basic\n\nareas:\n\na The manufacture of the circuit devices or chips\n\n* The assembly of those devices into packages\n\n* The electrical and environmental testing of products\n\n\n= Gnost Coepts. tnc\n\n61\n\nWithin each area, there is a series of subtechnologies that define\n\nand characterize the company\'s technology base. It is the inclusion\n\nof certain subtechnologies and the exclusion of others that determine\n\nthe technology base characteristics. Within each series there will\n\nbe certain subtechnologies that have the greater influence in deter\xc2\xad\nmining the overall technology base characteristics. Generally, the\n\ndominant subtechnologies within an area can be changed without\n\nrequiring substantial change in the dominant subtechnologies of the\n\nother two areas. A limited sample of the technology bases, subtech\xc2\xad\nnologies, processes, and manufacturing techniques used in the semi\xc2\xad\nconductor industry is shown in Figure 3.10. These examples are from\n\nthe manufacturing area for circuit devices or chips, as this area\n\nhas the most relevance to the photovoltaic venture.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.10\nDISTINCTION BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY BASE, SUBTECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES,\nAND MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES\n\nTehnloOS\n\nSOS\n\n.....\n\n-\n\nII\nDiffinso\n\nB.o\nB1"..\nDiffumon\n\nColle\nDifh.io\n\nuDi\n\nII\n\ncle.n/lnscechon\n\nFuoc\nT.peou\n\nMFuct~n\nTehniq~e.\n\nL\n\nnos\nDiFusion\n\nI\n\nI\n\nWet\nEtching\n\nPl.,s\nEtching\n\nNg.ti.\nResht\n\n.\n\nEleFtrccl\nTting\n\nTU.~\n\nGs\n\nWd.r\n\nFlow\n\nI.\n\nRts\n\nSiic\xc2\xa2n Wtfer\n\nI\n\nEmitter\nDiffsio\n\noct tffI\n,Im\n\nFhosolithogsosy\n\nEa~ol\n\nI\n\nThIog,\n\n-\n\nI\n\ni\n\nton\n\nL\n\nMOS\n\n-\n\nCG\n\nPtgtnfi\n\nEmulv.o\nM.6\n\nr;.\n\nty\n\n,Prnt\nFng\n\nH\nM.6\n\nPositive\nResist\n\np o,.ct\nt ckig\n\nn\n\nM.Htn\n\nH n;\nM~c\n\nRemovl\ntl.\nT p~ m\nRmonsn\n\nEsooiAush\xc2\xa2\n:\nus\n\nTIr\n.e\n\nBaking\nCycles\n\nTECHNOLOGY BASE COMPOSED OF MANY SUBTECHNOLOGIES\n\nsome common tecnnoiogy oases in tne semiconaucTor industry include\n\nbipolar, MOS (metal-oxide-silicon), and SOS (silicon-on-sapphire).\n\nWithin each of these major technologies, there are a series of\n\nsubtechnologies involved. One subtechnology is associated with\n\ndiffusion or junction formation within the bipolar technology. Other\n\nbipolar subtechnologies are photomasking, epitaxial growth, and\n\ngrowth and manufacturing of the basic silicon wafers used.\n\n\n62\n\nF= Cnostic Concepts Inc\n\nSUBTECHNOLOGIES HAVE MAJOR AND MINOR COMPONENTS\nEach of\n\nthese major subtechnologies is characterized by a series of lesser\n\nsubtechnologies. In the case of diffusion, it includes those\n\ndiffusions associated with collector, base, emitter, isolation, and\n\na series of other minor subtechnologies. In the case of the photo\xc2\xad\nlithography subtechnology, decisions must be made as to whether to\n\nuse wet or plasma etching or a combination of both, and whether or\n\nnot to use positive or negative photoresist. It is the collection\n\nof these minor subtechnologies that characterize the subtechnologies.\n\nMAJOR AND MINOR PROCESSES MAKE UP SUBTECHNOLOGY BASE\n\nEach of these minor subtechnologies has associated with it a collec\xc2\xad\ntion of processes, both major and minor in nature. For example, the\n\nbase diffusion in the bipolar technology base is composed of predif\xc2\xad\nfusion clean and inspection processes, diffusion times, electrical\n\ntesting, and several other processes. Each major process is charac\xc2\xad\nterized by a series of minor processes. For instance, the times\n\nrequired for base diffusion are a function of furnace temperature\n\nprofile, gas flow rates, wafer insertion and removal processes, along\n\nwith other requirements.\n\nMANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES DESCRIBE PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES\n\nTo carry out these processes, there must be implemented a number of\n\nphysical activities which are defined as manufacturing techniques.\n\nFor instance, the wafer insertion and removal processes may be manual\n\nin nature, or they may be automatic with the use of certain\n\nequipment.\n\nDIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY BASE HAS DIFFERENT COMPOSITION OF ELEMENTS\n\nIf, instead of bipolar, the MOS base technology were selected, a\n\ndifferent composition of subtechnologies, processes, and manufactur\xc2\xad\ning techniques would have to implemented. Still another set of such\n\nitems would have to be implemented if the SOS technology were to be\n\nthe base technology for a given company. Many elements described in\n\nthe bipolar process may be entirely suitable for use within these\n\nnew technology bases. However, the specific collection required for\n\nthe bipolar technology base could not satisfy the requirements of\n\nthe base technology in MOS or any other base.\n\nMULTIPLE TECHNOLOGY BASES LESS COMMON\nMost semiconductor\n\ncompanies have selected some major technology base upon which they\n\nhave founded all their product lines. The larger semiconductor\n\ncompanies, such as Texas Instruments, Fairchild, and National, have\n\nimplemented more than one. However, each of these large companies\n\nbegan with only one technology base. Through expansion of their\n\nresources, they have implemented parallel departments that are\n\ndedicated to the use of some of the other technology bases.\n\n\nSGnostk Concepts. Inc\n\n63\n\nEven within these larger companies, there is still a dominant\n\ntechnology base that exemplifies the majority of their products, even\n\nthrough there may be a collection of several technology bases. In\n\naddition, there are always separate manufacturing facilities associ\xc2\xad\nated with each technology base in these larger semiconductor. firms,\n\nheavily implying that it is not likely that a mixture of two tech\xc2\xad\nnology bases can be satisfactorily operated within the same manufac\xc2\xad\nturing facility. Thus if a semiconductor company is heavily based\n\nupon bipolar technology, it is unlikely that an MOS technology base\n\ncould be implemented within the same physical facilities as houses\n\nthe bipolar process.\n\nDESCENT OF HIERARCHY ALLOWS INCREASED CHANGE BUT LOWER INVESTMENT\n\nWithin the hierarchy of the technology base, which includes the\n\nsubtechnologies, processes, and manufacturing techniques, it is noted\n\nthat the further down in the hierarchy one proceeds, the more\n\nflexibility and likelihood of evolutionary changes will occur. For\n\ninstance, manufacturing techniques will constantly be changed and\n\nimplemented as new ideas are generated. However, it is very unlikely\n\nthat a company will ever change from a bipolar technology to an MOS\n\ntechnology or conversely.\n\nThere have been several attempts within the semiconductor\n\nindustry to make a major technology base change which have, in\n\ngeneral, met with failure. Only a few companies have been able to\n\nimplement parallel programs, such as bipolar and MOS technologies.\n\nFew other- companies have been successful or have the capital\n\nresources to even contemplate such a development.\n\nWhile manufacturing techniques may continually be in a state\n\nof flux, there is a certain solidarity and stability associated with\n\nthe processes. For instance, prediffusion clean and inspection may\n\nhave some technique changes associated with it, but it is unlikely\n\nthat removal of the prediffusion clean and inspection step will\n\noccur, or that the implementation of a prediffusion clean and\n\ninspection operation will be needed if it has not been needed in the\n\npast. In other words, process changes occur much more slowly than\n\ndo changes in the manufacturing techniques.\n\nSubtechnology changes are even more rare than process changes.\n\nFor instance, once a company has decided that diffusion technologies\n\nwill be used to formulate the P-N junctions, it is unlikely that ion\n\nimplantation will be implemented. Only after a thorough investiga\xc2\xad\ntion of ion implantation has been done and a proposed product taking\n\nadvantage of ion implantation has been conceived is a company likely\n\nto implement this new subtechnology. In no case will all of the\n\ndiffusion technologies be eliminated and replaced by ion implanta\xc2\xad\ntion. However, what may occur is the establishment of ion implanta\xc2\xad\ntion capability and then a slow evolution of its use within new\n\nproduct designs until each of the diffusion processes has been\n\nreplaced by ion implantation. Thus long-range evolutionary changes\n\nwill characterize subtechnology changes.\n\n\n64\n\nF\n\nGnostic Concepts Inc.\n\nThe same can be said concerning the use of positive resist if\n\nhistorically the company has been using negative resist subtechnolo\xc2\xad\ngies. The implementation of positive resist carries with it a change\n\nin the masking processes, it changes the entire mask layout proce\xc2\xad\ndure, and it is usually associated with a change in the type of mask\n\nused. All of these implied changes require significant capital\n\ninvestments and are thus slow in being implemented. In addition,\n\nthey must have specific rewards available to justify their\n\nimplementation.\n\nThus as one moves down through the hierarchy of the technology\n\nbase, one finds increasing opportunities for evolutionary changes\n\noccurring; but at the same time there is a decreasing investment\n\nrequired associated with these changes. Conversely, going up through\n\nthe hierarchy of the technology base, one finds an increasing reluc\xc2\xad\ntance to change and larger capital investments required for changes.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE\n\nTo date, there have been many manufacturing techniques that\n\nhave been obsoleted, and in some cases there have been processes that\n\nhave been obsoleted. By this it is meant they are no longer in\n\ncommon use. They have been replaced by less expensive or more\n\nefficient processes and manufacturing techniques.\n\nThe subtechnologies, however, have generally not been obso\xc2\xad\nleted, but they are changing in their relative dominance. As an\n\nexample, diffusion subtechnologies are being replaced by ion\n\nimplantation subtechnologies in selected companies.\n\nRELATIVE POSITION OF TECHNOLOGIES IS CHANGING\nTo date, no\n\ntechnology base in the semiconductor industry has completely obso\xc2\xad\nleted other technology bases. In the case of the MOS technology, it\n\nhas been gaining over the bipolar technology base in the number of\n\nnew circuits being introduced and the dollar volume associated with\n\nsales in the semiconductor industry. It does not mean that it is\n\nreplacing the bipolar process. It simply means that the marketplace\n\nfor the products built with the MOS technology base has a more rapid\n\ngrowth. To a large extent, this is based upon the fact that MOS\n\ntechnologies offer higher densities in product functions than does\n\nthe bipolar technology base. Consequently, cost can be reduced using\n\nthe MOS technologies. However, the bipolar technologies offer\n\nsignificant advantages in many cases associated with the speed at\n\nwhich digital and analog functions can be-performed. Thus it depends\n\nupon requirements of the marketplace as to whether speed or low cost\n\nthrough circuit density is the more dominant issue.\n\n\ncnostic Concepts. Inc\n,\n\n65\n\n\nThe SOS technology has been making slow but steady progress\n\nover the last five years. The potential of SOS is in the area that\n\nit offers extremely higher-speed devices than the bipolar processes\n\noffer. However, the expense associated with the growth of the\n\nsapphire substrate and the inability to develop successful subtech\xc2\xad\nnologies for the growth of the silicon epitaxial layers has\n\nrestricted the use of the SOS technology.\n\nOBSOLESCENCE IS A MATTER OF DEGREE\nThus technology obsoles\xc2\xad\ncence is a relative matter, or a matter of degree. In certain market\n\nareas, the bipolar process has become obsolete and has been replaced\n\nby the MOS technology. In other product areas, the bipolar\n\ntechnology is associated with continually growing markets,\n\n\nOBSERVATIONS CONCERNING NEW TECHNOLOGIES\n\nBefore entering a detailed discussion of investments in new\n\ntechnologies, some comments can be made concerning introduction and\n\nimplementation of such technologies.\n\nA new technology\n\nNEW TECHNOLOGY DRIVES PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nwill virtually always drive the development of a series of new\n\nproducts. A new technology is seldom developed strictly for cost\n\nreduction. A process, however, may be changed or implemented to\n\nreduce manufacturing costs.\nSubtechnologies are introduced to allow\n\nimprovements in product characteristics and reduce costs. With the\n\nintroduction of new technologies or subtechnologies, there is set in\n\nmotion a product development program to take avantage of the capa\xc2\xad\nbilities of these new technologies. It may be in parallel or after\n\nthe fact, but it will inevitably occur.\n\nNEW TECHNOLOGIES ASSESSED THROUGH NEW PRODUCTS\n\nNew technologies are usually developed in parallel with a new product\n\nthat will test the characteristics and limits of that new technology\n\nor new subtechnology. The development of a new technology or\n\nsubtechnology often adds greater capabilities to the manufacturing\n\noperation and opens new horizons in the area of product performance\n\nor product characteristics.\n\nIt is often impossible to know the exact characteristics of a\n\nnew subtechnology or technology without applying it to a product.\n\nThe reason for this is that changes in the subtechnologies often\n\ninteract with other subtechnologies, resulting in entirely unexpected\n\ncharacteristics. Thus to know the full effect of the subtechnology\n\nchanges, a product must be designed and used during the development\n\nphase to verify all of the interrelationships between the various\n\nsubtechnologies\n\n\n66\n\nF= Gnsd Concept. Inc\nt\n\nIn the case of a new technology base, very little actual data\n\nor information may be available within a given company concerning\n\nits complete capabilities. Only through the application of the new\n\ntechnology to a product or series of products can this be\n\naccomplished.\n\nNEW TECHNOLOGIES APPLIED FIRST IN PRESENT MARKETS\n\nNew technologies are often applied first through products sold in\n\nestablished markets for testing before introducing the technology\n\nand the products into new markets. Through introducing the new\n\ntechnology into known markets, previous history and reaction of that\n\nmarketplace to the standard products acts as a gauge by which the\n\nnew technology and its influence can be measured. In addition, if\n\nthere is a negative aspect to the new technology, as may be noted\n\nthrough reduced performance characteristics or reliability problems,\n\nthe reputation of the supplier within a given market is not totally\n\nruined because he has an established background and a back-up\n\nproduct. However, if the new technology is applied through products\n\nto new markets and failures occur, then very long-lasting ill effects\n\ncould exist within those new markets. This could restrict the pene\xc2\xad\ntration of the supplier at a later date, when he has resolved the\n\nreliability problems. Thus present markets are often used to test\n\nthe characteristics of the new technology.\n\nPERCEIVED STABILITY CONTROLS AUTOMATION.OF NEW TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe willingness to automate a new tecnnology concept is dependent\n\nupon the perceived stability or maturity of the new technology within\n\na given timeframe. For instance, if the technology appears to be\n\nsafe and secure for the next five years, automation may take place.\n\nHowever, if it is perceived that an even newer technology may replace\n\nthe present new technology within two years, then automation will\n\nnot take place unless influenced by government policies. Such a\n\npolicy would be rapid depreciation, such that the investment could\n\nbe recouped within the two-year period. In that case, it may be\n\nwell worth the implementation of automation for that new technology.\n\nThe perception of the stability and maturity of the new tech\xc2\xad\nnology can be influenced not only by government policies, but also\n\nby competition and market growth characteristics. If extremely rapid\n\nmarket growth is envisioned by a given company, then the investment\n\nin automation may occur, the reasoning being that the volume of\n\nproduction will be such that the investment can be recouped. This\n\nmay not be the viewpoint of all suppliers. Strong technology compe\xc2\xad\ntition may cause a company to be reluctant to automate. Conversely,\n\nweak technology competition may lure companies into early automation.\n\n\nF=costdc\nconcepts\n\nInc\n\n67\n\nThe perception of market conditions, future government\n\nactions, and competition can heavily influence trends in automation.\n\nThe timing of the automation can also be affected by availability of\n\nappropriate equipment. If long design and lead times are required\n\nfor equipment ,deliveries, then the willingness to commit to automa\xc2\xad\ntion will be weakened if the perceived stability time frame is short.\n\n\nNEW TECHNOLOGY APPLIED TO ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND MARKETS\n\nThe movement of a company to a new business position along\n\nthe technology base axis is demonstrated in Figure 3.11. The objec\xc2\xad\ntive of such a move is to increase or enhance product performance\n\nand/or implement cost reduction processes. In effect, a company may\n\npursue this route to remain competitive within present markets, but\n\nit will not necessarily guarantee a rapid growth situation within\n\nthose markets. The growth rate of the company will depend more upon\n\nthe characteristics of the markets being served rather than the\n\ntechnology base. The new technology base, however, could allow a\n\ncompany a rapid market share increase, but only for a restricted\n\ntime, as it is most likely that the technology base change that was\n\nimplemented will also be implemented by other competitors.\n\nA distinction must be made between implementation of a new\n\ntechnology base or a subtechnology and implementation of process\n\nchanges and manufacturing techniques, as demonstrated in Figure 3.10.\n\nThe implementation of process changes does not represent a movement\n\nalong the technology base axis. In addition, the degree to which\n\nsubtechnologies are implemented may or may not represent a signifi\xc2\xad\ncant change in the technology base. If only one new subtechnology\n\nis implemented, it is not likely to represent a significant change\n\nin the technology base. However, if a series of new technologies\n\nare introduced, then this could represent a change or evolution in\n\nthe company\'s technology base, as used in the context of this report.\n\nThe risks associated with\n\nRISKS ARE IN PROPORTION TO CHANGE\nthe movement along the technology base varies with the degree of the\n\ntechnology change. In the case of a semiconductor company, change\n\nfrom a bipolar technology base to an MOS technology base involves\n\nextremely high risk. In addition, if the same products are to be\n\nsupplied and the same markets are to be served, there is very little\n\nreason to believe that this technology change will be financially\n\nsuccessful. There are no known cases where a semiconductor company\n\nhas changed basic technologies and survived financially. There are\n\ncases, however, where additional technology bases have been added.\n\n\n68\n\n2\n\nGnottic Concepts Inc.\n\nFIGURE 3.11\nNEW rECHNOLOGY APPLIED TO ESTABLISHED\nPRODUCTS AND MARKETS\n\nTechnology\n\nBase\n\n\nNew Business\nPosition Desired\n\nPresent\nBusiness\n\nMajor\n\nPosition --------\n\nM.cdcets\n\nServed\n\nProduct\n\nDevelopment\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY CHANGE BY ITSELF UNLIKELY\nThere is little\n\nevidence to support the idea that a company would implement a new\n\ntechnology base to just gain market share. Market share gains may\n\nresult from a new technology base, but will not be the driving force.\n\nDue to the extremely high risks associated with new technology bases,\n\nthere must be some additional element behind such an implementation.\n\nRemaining competitive may be the primary driving force for this type\n\nof a movement, or a desire for a long-range change in a company\'s\n\nbusiness position. Thus the implementation of new technology bases\n\nwill be coupled with the development of new products and/or the\n\npenetration of new markets.\n\n\nM\n\nCnostic Concepts Inc\n\n69\n\nNEW TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT APPLIED TO ESTABLISHED MARKETS\n\nThe simultaneous development of technology and products, as\n\ndemonstrated in Figure 3.12, is a common occurrence. The development\n\nof the technology base does not imply the obsolescence or the\n\nreplacement of older technology bases. It implies the addition of\n\nnew technology bases or a series of subtechnologies to the company\'s\n\noverall capabilities. Within the semiconductor industry, this is\n\nthe most common method of developing a new technology base or imple\xc2\xad\nmenting subtechnologies, namely to couple it with the development of\n\na new product. These products will, in general, be directed at\n\npresently served markets but may also have outside application.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12\nNEW TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nAPPLIED TO ESTABLISHED MARKETS\nTechnology\n\nBase\n\n\nNew\nBusiness\n\nPosition\nDesired\n\nPresent\nBusiness\n\nMajor\n\nPosition -------\n\nMarer\ned\nSev\n\n7\n\nProduct\nDevelopment\n\n70\n\nCnostic Concepts Inc\n\nSHARE OF MARKET GAINS ENHANCED\nThis technique of technology\n\nand product development offers significant opportunity for an\n\nincrease in share within presently-served markets. The reason is\n\nthat product performance, and often product cost reductions, can be\n\nimplemented. Consequently, share of market increase can be\n\naccomplished.\n\nTECHNOLOGY CHANGE MORE RISKY THAN PRODUCT CHANGE\nThe risks\n\ninvolved are primarily associated with the development cost of the\n\nnew technology capabilities. As previously discussed, the costs of\n\nnew product development are relatively low and can be treated\n\nanalytically. The development of a new technology, on the other\n\nhand, can be a never-ending process. The characteristics of the new\n\ntechnology also may not be those originally envisioned.\n\nThe establishment of a new technology may require techno\xc2\xad\nlogical breakthroughs that will consume millions of dollars as well\n\nas many man-years of effort. .In addition to the direct costs and\n\ntime involved, there is always the possibility that a competitor will\n\nbe successful at an earlier date with an even better technology that\n\nwould reduce the effectiveness of the one being pursued. These risks\n\ncan only be offset by the future potential of the combination of the\n\ntechnology and new products associated with enhancing the development\n\nof new applications in the established markets presently being\n\nserved.\n\nThe type of movement referred to in this section is exempli\xc2\xad\nfied by the semiconductor industry in the development of a new MOS\n\ntechnology referred to as the HMOS, or high-performance MOS, tech\xc2\xad\nnology base. The technology base is the MOS technology, but associ\xc2\xad\nated with it are several significant new subtechnologies. The\n\ncoupling of these new subtechnologies with the remaining older MOS\n\nsubtechnologies produces a base technology with uniquely different\n\ncharacteristics, capabilities, and potential. To take advantage of\n\nthe new subtechnologies, new products are also being planned for\n\ndevelopment that will hopefully open up new types of applications\n\nwithin presently served markets. It is through this means that the\n\nrecouping of the investment costs must occur.\n\n\nNEW TECHNOLOGY APPLIED TO PRESENT PRODUCTS DIRECTED FOR NEW MARKET\n\nThis new business position\nsection on major markets served.\ntechnology base is implemented to\nmarkets, as shown in Figure 3.13.\nbe implemented within the present\nthe development of the technology\n\nE\n\nwas previously discussed in the\n\nThe concept here is that a new\n\nallow the penetration of new\n\nThe new technology, however, must\n\nproduct definitions.

The new markets being served will envision\n\nthe product in the same light as they envisioned the products prior\n\nto the implementation of the new technology, as the product\n\ncharacteristics will not be significantly changed.\n\nHIGH RISKS WITH NO ADVANTAGES\nThis combination of technology\n\ndevelopment and penetration of new markets combines the two highest\xc2\xad\nrisk aspects of the concept used to describe a change in a company\'s\n\nbusiness position, namely market development and technology develop-.\n\nment. Technology changes generally offer higher risk than product\n\nchanges from a reliability viewpoint.\n\nThe combination of new technology changes and new markets\n\ncould ruin the image of the supplier in the new markets, as previ\xc2\xad\nously discussed, with long-lasting effect, even after the problems\n\nare resolved. As a result, movement to this new business position\n\ngenerally offers no significant advantage to the supplier or the\n\nuser.\n\n\n72\n\n2Cnostk Concepts Inc\n\n3.3\n\nSIMULTANEOUS IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTY\n\nDIMENSIONS\nON\nDECISIONS\n\n\n0 V E R V I E W\n\nPrevious discussions have centered around the sequential\n\ndevelopment of no more than two major aspects of a company\'s business\n\nposition. There are, however, investment opportunities in which all\n\nthree major aspects must ultimately be pursued. The pursuit may be\n\nstrictly in a serial fashion or may involve a combination of\n\nsimultaneous developments.\n\nRISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT COMPLETE BARRIER TO INVESTMENTS\n\nMovement in a three-dimensional environment will compound the risks\n\ninvolved, complicate the decisions, and cause the investment to\n\nincrease many times. It can also spread the company\'s resources to\n\nthe danger level in attempting to accomplish too much in a short\n\ntime. Since ventures requiring simultaneous movements in more than\n\none business aspect do occur, then it can be concluded that\n\nuncertainties associated with such investments are not complete\n\nbarriers to high-risk ventures.\n\nMANY ROUTES AVAILABLE TO NEW BUSINESS POSITION\nThere are\n\nseveral routes by which a company may arrive at its new desired\n\nbusiness position. Each has its own characteristics, including\n\nadvantages and disadvantages and methods of handling risk. The\n\nparticular route that a company may follow can be heavily influenced\n\nby government activities, competition, previously established company\n\nresources, and changing market conditions.\n\nThe routes by which a company can move to a new business\n\npositioh include:\n\n* The direct route\n\ns The series development route\n\n* The combined development route\n\nThere is no reason to believe that a company must remain upon\n\none of these particular routes once they have begun to move into an\n\ninvestment area. It may be that through the obtaining of additional\n\ndata and information an entirely different route will be selected\n\nmidway through the venture to complete the final stages of the\n\ninvestment.\n\n\nSGnostc Concepts, Inc\n\n73\n\nMETHODS\nRISKS\n\nOF\n\nHANDLING\n\nTHREE-DIMENSIONAL\n\n\nDIRECT ROUTE\n\nTo move\nillustrated in\naspects of the\nimplies that a\nand sufficient\naccomplish the\n\ninto a new business position by the direct route is\n\nFigure 3.14.

This requires\n\ninvestments to be made in technology, product, and market development\n\nsimultaneously. Thus all of the risks associated with each of these\n\naspects are compounded and require a tremendous coordinated effort\n\nwithin the company to keep the total investment to a minimum.\n\nPursuit of this route often increases the overall investment because\n\nof the lack of timely feedback from market inquiries to influence\n\n,product development. In addition, commitments within the marketplace\n\nmay be made that cannot be supported as a result of a slower product\n\nor technology development than originally assumed.\n\nACQUISITIONS CAN REDUCE INVOLVED RISKS\nPursuit of the direct\n\nroute is usually associated with an acquisition or a series of\n\nacquisitions. Through the acquisition, many things can be accom\xc2\xad\nplished simultaneously. The acquisition of a company already in the\n\nnewly desired markets provides a foundation of customer contacts,\n\nknowledge concerning the customers\' needs, and pricing information,\n\nincluding price elasticity data. Depending on the nature of the\n\nacquisition, a product and manufacturing technology base can also be\n\nacquired.\n\nThe products may need modifications, and there may need to be\n\nadditional money spent on automation or updating of the technology\n\nbase, but the foundations of such technology requirements and product\n\nknowledge are usually readily available within the acquisition. This\n\nreduces the risks associated with the total investment. Given a\n\nsolid foundation, often only a slight additional investment in\n\nselected areas of the acquisition can result in tremendous returns.\n\n\nSERIES DEVELOPMENT ROUTE\n\nIn contrast to the direct route is the series development\n\nroute, in which a new business position is obtained through a series\n\nof developments. Typically such a sequence would be the development\n\nof a technology base, then products, then the development of new\n\nmarkets, as typified in Figure 3.15a. This is the most frequent\n\napproach if only company funds and internal development activities\n\nare to be used.\n\nThere are several alternative series routes that can be\n\npursued, as shown in Figures 3.15b, 3.16, and 3.17. The pursuit of\n\nthe route described in Figure 3.15b, in which first a technology\n\nbase, then new markets, and finally new products are pursued, is not\n\na common approach. The series development of first a technology base\n\nand then new markets was discussed in previous sections and was\n\ndetermined to be an inappropriate or inadequate and virtually\n\nnonexisting route.\n\n\nF= Gnostic Concepts Inc\n\n75\n\nFIGURE 3.15\nSERIES ROUTE - TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN\n8 - Followed by M,-eit\n\nA - Followed by Product Denlopn~ent\n\n-...............\n\n... -... \n\n\n.lopnient\n\nTchnolJoy\nBee\n\nTechnoloJy\nB.a\n\nP:ta\n\nP.M.io\n\nMocr\n\nBusines\n\ne\n\n.......\n\nPrdctPouct\nDenlccnt\n\nstaime\n\nMajor\n\n................. ......\n\nII,/\n\nDenlosent\n\nFIGURE 3.16\n\nSERIES ROUTE - PRODUCT DRIVEN\n\nB Followed by Technolog\n\nA - Followed by oet Development\n\nDevelopist\n\nTe.,.lgy\nBooe\n\nTecn1ooy\n\nNew&JnezNw&ne\n\nstDart.\n\n\n76t\n\nPseitonn\n\no\n\nServedl\n\nSwireosSered\n\nPsoduc\n\n76\n\nPsoosst\n\nnostic Concepts Inc\nG\n\nORGINAL PAGE\nPOOR QUALI y\n\nFIGURE 3.17\nSERIES ROUTE - MARKET DRIVEN\nA -\n\nollw\n\nby Fduct\n\nvlo\n\nnt\n\nB - FoIl.d y\n\nOF\nst D.\n\nI\n\nnnt\n\n.................\n\n\n.\n....... ...... .............. ...\n\nTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AFTER PRODUCT AND/OR MARKET DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe series development routes demonstrated\n\nRESTRICTS REWARDS\nin Figures 3.16 and 3.17, while they do exist within the context of\n\nthe concepts presented in this report, do not typically occur in\n\nindustry. The development of a technology after product or market\n\ndevelopment restricts the rewards to be gained. If a technology\n\ndevelopment is required, then it should occur before product and\n\nmarket development efforts to maximize the return. The technology\n\ndevelopment is the foundation of the change in a company\'s business\n\nposition.\n\nTIME\n\nSERIES ROUTE REDUCES RISK BUT LENGTHENS REQUIRED then products,\n\nThe series development of first technology, and\nfollowed by markets reduces the risk significantly over the direct\n\nroute. The drain on the company\'s resources at any given moment is\n\nalso less severe. Additionally, it allows for significant positive\n\nfeedback to influence the development route being pursued. The\n\ndisadvantage of this route, however, is that it requires a tremen\xc2\xad\npursuing each major aspect in a\n\ndously long developmental time.\n.serial fashion, new marts maytimes for product announcement and\n\npenetration of the opportune be bypassed.

The series parallel development route is based\n\nupon the development of only one business aspect prior to the simul\xc2\xad\ntaneous development of the other two aspects. The two most common\n\napproaches to the series parallel route are demonstrated in Figures\n\n3.20a and 3.20b.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.20\nSERIES PARALLEL ROUTE\nA- Technol y Div n\n\n3- Morwe Driven\n\nle flCIogy\n\nTecnnology\n\n........................\n\n,.......................\n\n\nN, tJ~\n\n..\n.\n\n.u..re.\n\nPedijio.\n\noc~\n\n? st\n\n. .\n\n.\n\n..\n\n:~N.\nC..nred\n\n... . ..\n........\n\nMae.d\n\n\n..........................\n\n;/.\n............................. i\n\n,c velontnt\n\nDev.IoomenI\n\nLARGE CORPORATIONS PURSUE DIFFERENT ROUTE FROM SMALL COMPANIES\n\nIt is not uncommon in large corporations to nave a separate tech\xc2\xad\nnology R&D facility. From the investigations in the research and\n\ndevelopment areas, many new technologies are developed virtually\n\nindependent of any intended product or future markets. Then, through\n\noperating business units within a corporation, this new technology\n\nis applied to opportunities in new markets requiring new products.\n\nThis approach is shown graphically in Figure 3.20a.\n\n\n80\n\nF= Gnostc Concepts Inc\n\nThis usually typifies the larger companies within an indus\xc2\xad\ntrial area. The smaller companies usually pursue the parallel series\n\nroute of developing products and technology simultaneously and then\n\napproach new markets with the resulting products. The large corpo\xc2\xad\nrations will also, but in addition they have the financial resources\n\navailable to allow them to pursue first the independent development\n\nof various technologies and then the parallel development of both\n\nnew product and markets.\n\nTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT MOST LIKELY INDEPENDENT OR ASSOCIATED WITH\n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nMany companies introduce their basic\n\nproouct lines into new markets. Penetration of those new markets,\n\nhowever, may be found to be restricted due to the limitations of\n\neither the technology or the product. Consequently, the firms will\n\nbegin the pursuit of a parallel activity in which products and tech\xc2\xad\nnologies are developed simultaneously to enhance the penetration.\n\nThis is typified by the approach shown in Figure 3.20b.\n\nThere is a third alternative in the series parallel route, as\n\nshown in Figure 3.21, in which products are developed for presently\n\nserved markets using established technologies. Then through a\n\nparallel effort, new markets and technologies are developed. The\n\ndrawback to this particular approach is that it does contain the\n\nelement of a simultaneous development of technology and markets\n\nwhich, in the previous sections discussing technology base, has been\n\ndownplayed as a viable option. There is no true advantage to either\n\nthe supplier or the end-user in seeking a new market and technology\n\nbase development simultaneously. Thus when a technology development\n\nis occurring, it is more likely to be either on an independent basis\n\nor associated with the simultaneous development of products, not the\n\nsimultaneous development of new markets.\n\nRISKS CAN BE REDUCED BY ACQUISITION AND/OR GOVERNMENT ACTIONS\n\nRisk can be reduced in the combined development routes through a\n\nseries of small acquisitions and/or government fundings. The\n\nparallel pursuit of two of the major business aspects can be handled\n\nby most companies. However, the simultaneous development of all\n\nthree major aspects is very seldom pursued.\n\nThrough government actions, if the risk can be reduced in one\n\nof the three major aspects, then a company may accelerate its arrival\n\nat the new business position. Combining government actions and a\n\nseries of small acquisitions can accelerate the arrival at the new\n\nposition even faster. The use of the acquisition route assumes,\n\nhowever, that there are established companies already in existence\n\nand that some form of the products needed already exists.\n\n\n2\n\nGnosticConceptsl\'\nI\n\n81\n\nFIGURE 3.21\nSERIES PARALLEL ROUTE - PRODUCT DRIVEN\n\nTechnology\n\nBase\n\nNew Btsiness\nPosition\n\n...............................\n\n.\n\nPresent\nBusiness\nPosition\n\nDesired\n\nMajor\nMarkets\nServea\n\nProduct\nDeveloprnent\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF PHOTOVOLTAIC VENTURES\n\nThere will be many and varied approaches to the photovoltaic\n\nventure, depending upon company resources, their assets, and their\n\nrelationships with both the government and their competitors. Which\n\nof the discussed routes will become the dominant is not clear at\n\nthis point.\n\nHistorically,\n\nTECHNOLOGY FORMED BASIS FOR VENTURE\ncompanies that have some\n\nphotovoltaic ventures have evolved from\ntechnological foundation related to the solar cell device itself.\n\nThe development and ultimate application of these technologies to\n\nviable commercial products has either been pursued internally or\n\nsold/licensed to other companies which have proceeded with the\n\ndevelopment of the commercial products.\n\n\n82\n\n2\n\nCno5tk Concepts, Inc\n\nIn all cases, activities have been on a relatively low scale\n\nbasis. The newly formed companies have usually been underfinanced\n\nand typically small, having relatively little production capacity.\n\nThose companies that have continued to pursue the development of the\n\nphotovoltaic ventures internally have not made it a major portion of\n\ntheir overall business. These investments are continually growing,\n\nhowever, and are intended ultimately to represent a s.ignificant part\n\nof the company\'s business activities.\n\nINDEPENDENT COMPANIES GENERALLY ACQUIRED BY LARGE CORPORATIONS\n\nFor the newly formed small photovoltaic companies, they have\n\nvirtually all been acquired by large corporations. The two basic\n\nreasons for this are:\n\n* The newly formed companies find they are underfinanced and\n\ncannot afford the developmental costs of technology,\n\nproducts, and new markets.\n\n* The larger corporations envision the photovoltaic venture\n\nas a long-term, high-growth opportunity and are motivated\n\nto invest in such future potentials. They realize they do\n\nnot have internally the technological or product base with\n\nwhich to gain a foothold in the new markets. To accelerate\n\ntheir development in this particular marketplace, they\n\nchoose the acquisition route over the internal development\n\nroute.\n\nBASIC CONFLICT BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY OBJECTIVES\n\nThere is a basic conflict between the goals and objectives of the\n\nfederal government in the photovoltaic venture and those of private\n\nenterprise. The federal government is in the pursuit of resolving a\n\npotential energy crisis problem. Private industry, however, is\n\ninterested in the photovoltaic venture only from a financial view\xc2\xad\npoint. They are responsible to their stockholders and must return a\n\nreasonable profit on any investment. The motivation to resolve a\n\nnational energy crisis is not yet a formidable part of any\n\ncorporation\'s plans or objectives.\n\nThe federal goals and objectives do not necessarily consider\n\nprofit making as a significant element. It is implied on the part\n\nof the federal government that profits will be forthcoming, but it\n\nhas not been used as a guiding force in developing the photovoltaic\n\nventure, certainly not in the same perspective as industry views it.\n\nIt is unlikely that private industry will change their basic\n\ngoals and objectives to make them compatible with those of the fed\xc2\xad\neral government. Consequently, the responsibility for making the\n\nfederal government\'s goals and objectives compatible with those of\n\nprivate industry lies squarely with the federal government. Through\n\ntheir actions, policies, and programs, they must account for all of\n\nthe restrictions that private industry is bound by and find a con\xc2\xad\nstructive means by which the national goals and objectives can also\n\nbe accomplished.\n\n\nF= Gnostic Concepts Inc\n\n83\n\n3.4\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\nOF\n\nCOMPAN I ES\n\n\nOPTIONS\n\n\nNEED TO CLASSIFY\n\nThe approaches to developing a new business position are\n\nvaried in nature, size, and the route pursued. To arrive at some\n\ncommon denominators such as perceived barriers to investments, basic\n\nelements of the investment process, and items influencing the final\n\ninvestment decision, there is a need to classify companies in a\n\nmeaningful order.\n\nOne of the most common methods of classifying companies is to\n\nsegregate them by their industry type. Examples of this would be\n\npetroleum-based, chemical-based, material, industrial, and semi\xc2\xad\nconductor companies. Within each of these industry-type classifi\xc2\xad\ncations, the companies can be subgrouped still further by their\n\nannual dollar volume of business and assets. Other schemes of\n\nclassifying these industrial types would include segregating them by\n\nthe markets served, or by the type of structure that the company\n\nrepresents; i.e., a narrow-based company serving relatively few\n\nmarkets, or structured in the form of a conglomerate in which there\n\nare many companies serving many market areas. Still other classifi\xc2\xad\ncation schemes could be based upon their technology base, or their\n\ntype of products.\n\nIn all of these cases, very little insight is obtained as to\n\nwhat the investment processes are; namely, how a final decision is\n\nmade concerning an investment; how risk is handled; or what the\n\nperceived barriers may be to an investment, especially in a high\xc2\xad\nrisk area such as the photovoltaics venture. Thus there is a need\n\nfor a classification scheme that brings to the forefront the motiva\xc2\xad\ntions why a company would invest in a high-risk operation.\n\n\nCLASSIFICATION METHOD\n\nIn addition to motivation as being a method of classifying\n\ncompanies, a second perspective is based upon the company\'s rela\xc2\xad\ntionship to the photovoltaic venture; i.e., its relationship to the\n\ntechnologies involved, the products and the markets to be served.\n\nCombining this scheme with that of motivations will give greater\n\ninsights into how a company may view the ramifications of such an\n\ninvestment.\n\n\n84\n\nD Cnostc Cocepts. Inc\n\nFOUR COMPANY GROUPINGS IN RELATION TO PHOTOVOLTAIC VENTURE-\n\nThe concept of classifying companies as to their relationship to the\n\nphotovoltaic venture and their motivation for making the investment\n\nis shown in Table 3.3. The photovoltaic industry can be looked upon\n\nas one that supplies electrical generating equipment. Thus the first\n\nclassification of companies that would be identified are:\n\ne Suppliers of energy-generating equipment\n\n\t\na Suppliers of materials that would allow for the generatipn\n\n\t\nof electrical energy\n\na Related peripheral equipment companies\n\n\t\nThese companies will be influenced by a significant photovoltaic\n\nindustry development program. Their markets will especially be\n\ninfluenced in a direct fashion.\n\nTABLE 3.3\n\nCOMPANY GROUPINGS BY INVESTMENT MOTIVATION\n\nInvestment Motivation\n\nCompany Groups\n\nMajor\n\nMinor\n\nEnergy \'arket Companies\nConsumanle producers\nEnergy-generating\nequipment manufacturers\n\nProtect market position\nthrough diversification\nin energy business\n\nEnhance image\nShort/intermediate\xc2\xad\nterm ROI\n\nLong-term ROI\nRelated equipment\nmanufacturers\nLarge Energy Users\n\nFunctional systems\nsupplier \t\n\nProtect/develop supply\nsource\n\n\nROI\n\n\nMajor business spin-off\n\nDiversification\n\n\nHigh growth, near-longterm ROI\n\n\nImage\n\n\nRelated Technology\n\nCompanies\n\nSemiconductor-based\ncompanies\n\nMaterials-oriented\nfirms\n\n\nIndustry technology leader\n\nUnrelated Companies\n\nConglomerates\n\nHigh growth, good ROI\n\nImage\n\n\nDiversification\n\nLong-range position\n\n\nEnhance other markets\n\n\n2\n\nGnostc Concepts Inc\n\n85\n\nAnother category of companies that relate to the energy aspect\n\nare those firms that are involved in the consumption of the electric\n\nenergy that is generated. In particular, reference is being made\n\nhere to large energy users who may require a captive source of\n\nelectrical energy.\n\nThese two categories of companies thus cover the market and\n\nthe product aspect of a photovoltaic business position.\n\nA third category of companies that would be involved or\n\ninterested in photovoltaic industry developments would be those that\n\nhave a compatible or related technology base. This would not only\n\ninclude a technology in the solar cell device area, but also tech\xc2\xad\nnologies in the generation\'and produttion of the basic raw materials\n\nthat may be consumed in or part of photovoltaic products. This type\n\nof company covers the third aspect of the photovoltaic business\n\nposition, namely the technology base.\n\nA fourth type of company classification also exists. This\n\nwould be the company that has no relationship at the present time to\n\nthe photovoltaic industry or the energy-producing industry. There\n\nexist such companies that will be motivated to enter this particular\n\npotential high-growth industry as a result of an internal\n\ndiversification objective.\n\nThe motivation for any of these\n\nMAJOR-AND MINOR MOTIVATIONS\ntypes of companies to invest in the photovoltaic venture can be\n\nbroken into major and minor groupings. An investment in the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic industry will always be driven by one or more major motiva\xc2\xad\ntions. At the same time, there may be several minor motivations that\n\nwould also encourage a company to make the investment. However,\n\nthese by themselves would not be of sufficient magnitude to cause a\n\ncompany to make the necessary investments. These minor motivations\n\nserve to round out the total package for justifying the entrance into\n\na high-risk photovoltaic venture.\n\n\nAND\nCOMPANIES\nOF\nTYPES\nINVEST\n\nTO\nMOTI VATION\n\nTHEIR\n\n\nENERGY EQUIPMENT AND PRODUCTION COMPANIES\n\nThis group of companies includes those that produce energy\n\nconsumables, such as gas, fuel oil, coal, and/or uranium. It also\n\nincludes that group of companies that produce energy-generating\n\nequipment, such as hydro, steam, or gas turbo electric generators.\n\nOther related equipment manufacturers would include companies\n\nsupplying such items as power regulators, coal extraction equipment,\n\nand oil-drilling equipment.\n\n\n86\n\nEl Cnostc Concepts Inc\n\nMAJOR MOTIVATIONS\nThe major investment motivation of this\n\ngroup of companies is one of protecting their long-range market\n\nposition through diversification in the energy business. The major\n\npetroleum-based companies, as an example, recognize that oil supplies\n\nwill ultimately decrease. Unless they have positioned themselves in\n\nthe business of supplying alternate energy sources, their future\n\nbusiness will also decrease. This would include diversification into\n\nsuch items as geothermal equipment, coal and uranium production, and\n\nphotovoltaics. The same statement is equally true for major electric\n\ngenerating equipment companies such as Westinghouse and General\n\nElectric, both of which have already diversified from steam turbine\n\ninto gas and nuclear power systems and have photovoltaic programs in\n\nexistence.\n\nA second major investment motivation for these companies would\n\nbe long-term return on investments. If there were no prospect for\n\nacceptable long-term return through diversification in the energy\n\nbusiness itself, then they would have to look outside of the energy\n\nbusiness for future investments. However, at the present time there\n\nappears to be no end to the increasing demand for energy. Conse\xc2\xad\nquently, prospects for excellent returns in the energy field are\n\npossible.\n\nMINOR MOTIVATIONS\nA minor investment motivation would be\n\nthe potential to enhance the company\'s image in the public\'s eye by\n\nshowing interest in photovoltaics. This may, however, be impossible\n\nto accomplish. It is possible that the public would be opposed to\n\nlarge energy companies diversifying into other energy areas. Still\n\nanother minor investment motivation could be the development of\n\nshort- or intermediate-term return on investments. This would be\n\npossible, depending upon the rate of market development and the\n\nspecific government policies and actions that are implemented.\n\n\nDIRECT ENERGY PRODUCERS AND LARGE ENERGY USERS\n\nIt is possible that direct energy producers or large func\xc2\xad\ntional system suppliers that require independent power sources might\n\ninvest in photovoltaic production facilities with the major invest\xc2\xad\nment motivation being to protect, ensure, or develop a source of\n\nsupply of photovoltaic arrays. This implies to some extent that the\n\nnormal supplier sources are not expected to develop rapidly enough\n\nto meet the market demand.\n\nThe photovoltaic products in these cases would be very\n\nspecialized in nature for such intended uses as cathodic protection\n\nof pipelines, power for remote microwave transmitters, or production\n\nof power at central or substation locations within electrical utility\n\ndistricts. Another example might be the major water pump manufac\xc2\xad\nturers wanting to ensure a supply of photovoltaic power sources at\n\n\n2\n\nnostic concepts Inc\n\n87\n\nthe lowest possible prices for the irrigation industry. A second\n\nand probably minor investment motivation for this company group would\n\nbe the obtaining of a reasonable return on investment for their\n\nefforts at photovoltaic production.\n\n\nRELATED-TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES\n\nThe related-technology companies not only include those\n\ncompanies with a technology base capable of producing solar cell\n\ndevices, but also those companies that are producers or suppliers of\n\nraw material involved in the production of photovoltaic products.\n\nExamples of the companies in the related technology grouping would\n\ninclude the semiconductor companies, and manufacturers .of plastics,\n\nfilms, silicon, polysilicon, glass, and aluminum.\n\nMAJOR MOTIVATIONS\nFor this group of companies, the major\n\ninvestment motivation would be to form a new business venture through\n\na spin-off of their technology base or material production expertise.\n\nAs a general rule, these companies would be looking for high-growth\n\nmarkets in their new investment. Excellent near- and long-term\n\nreturn on investment would also be a major requirement.\n\nIt should be noted that the near-term return on investment\n\nwill be just as important to these companies as the long-term return\n\non investment. This is a clear distinction of this company grouping\n\nas compared to the energy-producer and equipment company categories.\n\nA third major investment motivation would be the desire to\n\nuse their expertise in technology or material manufacturing\n\ncapabilities to become an industry technological leader.\n\nMINOR MOTIVATIONS\nMinor investment motivations would include\n\nthe desire for\'-Tversification of their overall product and customer\n\nbase. In addition, the image of a company moving into advanced\n\ntechnological energy supply areas would be of some value. In\n\ngeneral, the public would not view these companies in a negative\n\nfashion as they may view petroleum-based companies entering the\n\nphotovoltaic industry.\n\n\nUNRELATED COMPANIES\n\nThe unrelated companies that might possibly invest in a\n\nphotovoltaic venture are those companies with no current relationship\n\nto photovoltaics by virtue of their technology base, material exper\xc2\xad\ntise, or involvement in the energy markets. Should such companies\n\ndecide to invest in photovoltaics, their major motivation would be\n\nbased upon the perception that the photovoltaic industry offered high\n\ngrowth potentials with extremely good potential for excellent-,\n\nnear-, and long-term return on investments.\n\n\n88\n\nMCoSdc ConcePtb\n\nInc\n\nSecondly, they would also consider it as a significant diver\xc2\xad\nsification within their company. To some extent, this motivation\n\nfactor would imply that these companies tend to be conglomerates\n\nwhich are already accustomed to the diversification process.\n\nIn certain instances for the unrelated company groupings, a\n\nmajor investment motivation may also be to enhance its other markets\n\nthat it presently serves. An example here would be a battery company\n\ndiversifying into photovoltaics because they believe it would enhance\n\ntheir battery markets.\n\nWith respect to minor investment motivation, all of these\n\nunrelated companies would consider image in the new photovoltaic\n\nenergy area to be of interest. A second minor motivation would be\n\nthat many of these companies would perceive their venture in photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaics as giving them the possibility of an excellent long-range\n\nposition in a new high-growth industry.\n\n\nGnostic Concepts. Inc.\n\n89\n\n3.5\n\nDEC ISION\nSPECTRUM OF\nINFLUENCES\n\nRELATED\n\nINVESTMENT\n\nPROPOSAL\n\nMETHODS\n\nAND\n\n\nPROCESSES\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nBefore a company can arrive at a decision to invest in photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaics or any other venture, there must be a proposal set forth\n\nthat suggests that an investment be made. Some source and mechanism\n\nfor bringing this proposed investment to the attention of the\n\ncorporate decision makers must exist within the company.\n\nare four basic\n\nThere \n\nFOUR BASIC INVESTMENT PROPOSAL SOURCES\nsources that can generate an investment proposal and carry it forward\n\nto the attention of the appropriate individuals.\n\nThe major sources for investment proposals include:\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nThe business unit\n\nA corporate executive\n\nThe corporate research and development group\n\nVenture analysis group\n\n\nWithin a given company, any one or a combination of these investment\n\nproposal avenues may exist. In addition, there may be specialized\n\nmethods by which investment proposals are also generated within\n\nthose companies.\n\nMECHANISTIC ASPECTS ONLY COMMONALITY BETWEEN COMPANIES\n\nIt should be noted that any of these approaches within a given\n\ncompany will differ from its counterpart in some other company, even\n\nwithin the same industrial classification of companies or any other\n\nclassification that may be applied. In effect, each company tailors\n\nthe basic investment proposal procedures and builds into them those\n\nitems they wish to accentuate.\n\nMost of the investment proposal processes in the companies\n\nsurveyed were, however, very similar to one another from a mechan\xc2\xad\nistic point of view; i.e., most all of them were based on a business\n\nplan for the development of a given project. Discounted cash flow\n\nanalyses, return on investment, payback periods, and other financial\n\nparameters were typically used to place all business plans on a\n\ncomparable basis. In addition, some companies carried this analyti\xc2\xad\ncal analysis a step further by analyzing the sensitivity of financial\n\nreturns to market inputs and investment requirements. Still other\n\ncompanies went one further step in sophistication to consider poten\xc2\xad\ntial investments with respect to expected market share, relative\n\nmarket share, capital intensity, and other factors.\n\n\n90 \n\n\nFECnosdc concepts, Inc\n\nThere are no particularly distinguishing characteristics\n\nregarding investment processes from a mechanistic standpoint from\n\ncompany to company. The differences rise primarily in the area of\n\ndetails in the aspects of primary emphasis.\n\n\nBUSINESS UNIT UP PROCESS\n\nThe most common approach to development of a new business\n\nventure is from the grass roots level, especially in a major organi\xc2\xad\nzation. The idea germinates within a division at a relatively low\n\nlevel and builds slowly, ultimately becoming a line item in the\n\ndivision\'s overall business plan. It does not become visible to the\n\ncorporate executive level until it has reached a size that requires\n\nan investment above a predetermined level, depending upon how the\n\nproduct and the potential liability to the organization has been\n\ndefined.\n\nBy this time, the investment has received the adamant support\n\nof at least one or more "champions." Such a "champion" will carry\n\nthe bulk of the effort in seeing that all of the necessary require\xc2\xad\nments for a corporate review are met. In most cases, this individual\n\nis one who is known and creditable to the executive staff of the\n\ncompany.\n\nThe new proposed venture also generally will fit within a\n\nparticular market interest of the supporting division and will have\n\nat least a long-term potential for excellent return on investment.\n\nIn addition, the proposed idea will generally fit the accustomed\n\nmanner of marketing and distribution of the other divisional\n\nproducts. There are exceptions to this where the company has strong\n\ndiversification tendencies and divisions are given wide latitudes.\n\nThis is not,-.however, the general case.\n\nThe requirements for bringing the investment proposal to the\n\nattention of the corporate staff is well known by both the division\n\nleaders and the "champion." These requirements would include the\n\npreparation of a business plan, the analytical analysis of several\n\nkey financial parameters that are of high interest to the corporate\n\nstaff, a discussion or preparation of papers covering the long-range\n\nand short-term potentials of the investment. Additional detailed\n\nreports may be necessary to support or justify the potential venture.\n\nIt may be that a separate division is required because of the\n\npeculiar characteristics of the proposed investment.\n\nIn most cases, the corporate staff will not request additional\n\ninformation beyond that-supplied. If sufficient information is not\n\nsupplied by the supporting organization, then the executive staff\n\nmay come to a negative decision concerning the investment. It must\n\nbe emphasized that the impetus for supplying all of the needed\n\ninformation is on the shoulders of the operating division and\n\n"champion."\n\n\nGnostk Concept Inc\n\n91\n\n6-0\n\n\nCORPORATE EXECUTIVE DOWN PROCESS\n\n\nOccasionally the corporate executive level will strategize\n\nthat the company should move into another investment area. The\n\nsuggestion for an investment may come from a single individual within\n\nthe corporate staff or from a group of individuals who feel such\n\ninvestments should at least be investigated.\n\nOften the decision process in this case is not based upon\n\nnearly the large amount of quantitative data that would ordinarily\n\nbe used should a division submit a new investment consideration to\n\nthe executive staff. Upon receipt of a suggested investment area,\n\nthe appropriate division will generate an implementation plan and\n\nresubmit it to the executive staff for approval. In many of these\n\ncases, approval of the basic concept has probably already been\n\nimplied and it now becomes a matter of approving the tactical\n\ndetails. In effect, the "champion" is a decision maker at a corpo\xc2\xad\nrate level and by his nature will not require as sophisticated a\n\njustification as he might otherwise require on an investment in which\n\nhe is not as familiar or emotionally involved.\n\nThe investment proposal process within the supporting division\n\nis essentially the same as described in the business unit up process,\n\nexcept that less detail is usually needed and a quicker decision can\n\nbe arrived at due to the prior interest on the part of the corporate\n\nstaff. If, however, the corporate staff member who suggested the\n\ninvestment proposal originally is not a dominant member of the\n\ncorporate decision group, the proposal may require the same depth of\n\nanalysis as would otherwise be required.\n\n\nCORPORATE R&D GROUP PROCESS\n\nAnother source of investment proposals is the corporate\n\nresearch and development (R&D) group. A major function of many\n\ncorporate R&D groups is to stay abreast of the technologies affecting\n\ntheir company\'s basic business, including developing technologies\n\nthat may represent reasonably allied future diversification programs.\n\nIn most cases, the R&D group in following and developing technologies\n\nattempts to transfer the technology to an operating divisional group\n\nat the earliest possible time. This is done because the divisions\n\ntruly have greater resources for implementing the new technologies,\n\nparticularly in the business and marketing area. Even in the cases\n\nwhere the technology is not directly related to a division\'s\n\nproducts, the R&D group will attempt to place the technology in the\n\nmost appropriate division. Once the technology base has been suc\xc2\xad\ncessfully transferred to a division, the investment proposal process\n\nfollows the business unit up procedures.\n\n\n92\n\nF2 Gnostk Concepts Inc\n\nShould placing the technology within a divisional group fail,\n\nthe other alternative may be to promote the commercial development\n\nof the technology at the executive level. This approach is seldom\n\nused because it quite often fails. A divisional "champion" is\n\nneeded, and if the R&D group has not made a convincing case for\n\nprofitable new business development at the divisional level, it is\n\nunlikely that they will be able to develop a sympathetic audience at\n\nthe corporate executive level.\n\n\nVENTURE ANALYSIS GROUP PROCESS\n\nWithin many companies there exists a specialized group known\n\nas the venture analysis group. The objective of this group is to\n\ninvestigate programs that might lead to the continued investment of\n\ncompany resources into high-growth opportunities. This group will\n\npursue and analyze proposed concepts for investments from many\n\nsources. They would include sources within the group, from the R&D\n\norganizations, from the various business units, the corporate staff,\n\nand from sources outside the company also.\n\nWhere such organizations exist, all proposed invesments,\n\nregardless of source, will be funneled through this venture analysis\n\ngroup. This group will be especially equipped to supply all of the\n\nneeded information for the executive staff at the time a decision\n\nmust be made. The actual work in the preparation of the reports may\n\nultimately have to be supplied by the supporting division or the R&D\n\ngroup, but it will be under the direction of this venture analysis\n\ngroup and special assistance will be made available.\n\nThe processes and procedures carried out by the venture\n\nanalysis group do not differ ih substance from those required of a\n\nbusiness unit up proposal process. The advantage of a company having\n\na-venture analysis group is that more opportunities can be\n\ninvestigated, coordinated, and ranked.\n\nOften within a given fiscal year, several hundred investment\n\nopportunities may be made available. It would be one of the prime\n\nfunctions of a venture analysis group to rank these opportunities in\n\nsuch a fashion that the corporate staff will have to make decisions\n\non relatively few opportunities, namely those that will have the\n\n\'greatest benefit to the long- and short-term objectives of the\n\ncompany.\n\nThe existence of a venture analysis group is usually associ\xc2\xad\nated with companies that have large revenue bases that generate\n\nsi\'gnificant profits and positive cash flow conditions. In addition,\n\nthose companies that are heavily involved in long-range strategic\n\nplanning also tend to have a venture analysis group available within\n\n\n2\n\nGnost Concepts. 1c.\n\n93\n\nthe corporation. To maintain excellent profits, high cash flow, and\n\nassure long-term strategic planning is developed, companies have\n\nfound it necessary to establish such venture analysis groups that\n\nare dedicated to those specific purposes.\n\n\nELEMENTS OF THE INVESTMENT PROPOSAL PROCESSES\n\nThere are several elements that can be identified as being\n\ncommon to all of these investment proposal processes. These would\n\ninclude:\n\ns A need to develop a "champion" within a given company. It\n\n\t\nis the "champion\'s" responsibility to gather all of the\n\nrequired documents, justifications, and ensure that the\n\nnecessary statistical data is made available. The more\n\nreputable the "champion" is, the more likely the investment\n\nwill be looked upon in a favorable fashion at the time of\n\nfinal decision.\n\nI A need for statistical data on various aspects of the\n\n\t\ninvestment. In this area, the statistical data applies to\n\nthe nonfinancial issues, namely the aspects involved with\n\nmarket growth potential, price elasticity within the market,\n\nproduct descriptions, resources available within the\n\ncompany, and resources that must be acquired if the\n\ninvestment is to proceed forward.\n\n# A need to perform certain minimum analyses of financial\n\n\t\nparameters. These also will vary from company to company,\n\nbut in general the calculations concerning total investment\n\nrequirement, a discounted cash flow analysis, a return on\n\nassets or return on investment, are usually the minimum\n\nitems that are required.\n\n* A need to find a compatible operating division within the\n\ncompany to support the proposed investment. This is\n\nespecially true during the early stages of the venture\n\ndevelopment. Very few companies will form a new division\n\nearly in the investment cycle.\n\n* A need to identify the priorities and the major motivations\n\n\t\nthat will enhance a company\'s likelihood to make the\n\nproposed investment. The proposed investment must enhance\n\nthese motivations and be compatible with company objectives.\n\n\n94\n\n2\n\nCnoc Concepts Ic.\n\nFINAL\nOF\nELEMENTS\nENVIRONMENT\n\n\nDECISION\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nOnce all of the necessary requirements of the investment\n\nproposal process are met, there still needs to\'be a final decision\n\nmade by the corporate staff before an investment in a high-risk\n\nventure can be finalized. The involvement of the corporate execu\xc2\xad\ntives responsible for the final investment decision adds a new\n\nelement into the investment picture. In many cases, these individu\xc2\xad\nals will not be as knowledgeable of the proposed investment as the\n\n"champion" or supporting division. The "champion" and the supporting\n\ndivision thus have the responsibility to sell the corporate decision\xc2\xad\nmakers on the ideas and concepts of the proposed investment.\n\nThe final decision process is a critical element in the\n\noverall investment environment. The interaction of the final\n\ndecision authority and the supporting "champion" of the proposed\n\ninvestment, along with the influence of all of the statistical and\n\nanalytical parameters come to play in the final decision environment.\n\nThrough a review of the interaction of these elements, insights into\n\nthe relative importance of all of these elements can be obtained.\n\n\nFINAL AUTHORITY\n\nThere exist within each company a final authority that can\n\ndetermine if an investment will be made or if the nature of the\n\ninvestment will be changed. The existence of this final authority\n\nis for the purpose of supporting or denying investments in high-risk\n\nventures.\n\nThis final authority will vary in size\n\nGROUP SIZE VARIES\nfrom one to several persons. There will exist within this final\n\nauthority group a dominant individual who will have significant\n\ninfluence upon the ultimate thinking of the entire group. Each\n\nmember of the group, however, will have a role to play in the final\n\ninvestment decision. Their role may vary from simply being a passive\n\nobserver with occasional questioning for clarification of issues to\n\nbeing a "devil\'s advocate." These persons will not only interact\n\nwith the "champion," but also with each member of the final authority\n\ngroup. Their group purpose will be to bring out all issues and to\n\nresolve them in as appropriate a manner as possible prior to making\n\na final decision.\n\n\nF\n\nCnostk Concepts, Inc\n\n95\n\nIn the case of a one-person final\n\nONE-PERSON AUTHORITY\ndecision group, this individual is usually a high-ranking official\n\nof the company. Typically, small companies are dominated by a single\n\nultimate decision-maker, but even large corporations can also be\n\ndominated by such an individual. This ultimate decision-maker in\n\neffect is a dictator within the investment environment. This\n\nindividual usually had a significant influence upon the original\n\nestablishment of the company and has had a dominant role in the\n\ndevelopment of the company since its origination.\n\nThere also exist larger ultimate decision\xc2\xad\nTRIARCHY APPROACH\nmaking groups. For instance, there exists a triarchy or three-member\n\nultimate decision group. However, within this triarchy there is\n\nalways one dominant member. While the two remaining members have\n\nsignificant influence upon the ultimate decision, their role is still\n\nsupplemental to the dominant figure within the group. The dominant\n\nindividual within the group may be the president of the company and\n\nthe other two members key individuals within his organization, such\n\nas the Vice President of Operations and the Vice President of\n\nFinance.\n\nStill larger\n\nMULTIMEMBER GROUP DOMINATED BY SMALL SUBGROUP\nmultimember groups may make up the ultimat-e-ecision-makers. Again,\n\nthere will always be a dominant member within this group. These\n\nlarger multimember groups will vary in size from five to ten members.\n\nAs the size of the multimember group increases, there is always a\n\ntendency for a select group of individuals within the total group to\n\nevolve as the dominant members of that group; and within that\n\nsubgroup there will be a dominant individual.\n\nThe size of the multimember group can increase to as many as\n\n20 to 25 members in certain organizations. However, within such\n\nlarge groups there will be a subgroup of three to five members that\n\nwill dominate.\n\nFor the smaller groups in the range of three to seven members,\n\nthe dominant individual can and often does make the ultimate\n\ndecision. The lesser dominant members of these groups may or may\n\nnot express their viewpoints of the investment until they have sought\n\nout the viewpoint of the single dominant individual in the group.\n\nHow that group operates depends upon tradition and the political\n\nstatus they hold within the company. The dominant individual within\n\nthe group may seek out the viewpoint of each individual member,\n\nHowever, he has the power to completely overrule the thinking of the\n\nmajority.\n\nThe survey of\n\nGROUP SIZE NOT RELATED TO COMPANY SIZE\ncompanies indicated that the size of the final decision-making group\n\nis not related in any fashion to the size of the company nor to the\n\ncompany assets. The size of the final decision group seems to\n\n\n96\n\nGnostlc Concepts Inc\n\ndepend upon an evolutionary process. As long as the original\n\nfounders are in a controlling position of a company, the size of the\n\nfinal decision group tends to be small. As the original founders\n\nare replaced within the organization, there is a tendency for the\n\ndecision group to become larger and larger. The development of the\n\nsubgroup within a large multimember group is usually made up of the\n\nmore dominant members of the corporate staff who have achieved\n\nabove-average political stature within the corporate structure.\n\n\nCOMPONENTS INFLUENCING FINAL AUTHORITY\n\nThe final authority group makes no decisions unless requested.\n\nThere must be some outside influence forcing the group to make a\n\ndecision concerning an investment. Even in the case where an\n\ninvestment suggestion or strategy is put forth by a member of the\n\nfinal decision-making group, it must be sent downstream within the\n\ncorporation and resubmitted through normal channels with all of the\n\nsupporting information.\n\nThere are three main elements that come to play during the\n\nfinal decision process that will influence the decision of the group.\n\nThese influences include:\n\n* The "champion." Such a "champion" must exist regardless of\n\nthe company size or structure and must usually be in\n\naddition to any "champion" that may exist within the\n\nultimate decision-making group. The strength and stature\n\nof an active "champion" of the proposed investment is\n\ncritical and will have a significant influence upon the\n\nfinal decision.\n\n* The results of quantitative analysis. These analyses are\n\nbased primarily upon financial parameters, such as the\n\nreturn on investment, return on assets, discounted cash\n\nflow, present value of investments, payback period, and\n\nmany other sensitivity analyses as may be determined by the\n\nultimate decision-makers.\n\n* The relative knowledge and opinion on qualitative issues by\n\nboth the "champion" and the final authority group. Quali\xc2\xad\ntative issues include such items as technology risk evalu\xc2\xad\nations, market size projections, government influences,\n\ncompetition and share of market potential, proper timing to\n\nenter the market, and compatibility with corporate\n\nobjectives.\n\nThese influences, along with the spectrum of group size of the\n\nultimate decision-makers, are portrayed in Figure 3.22.\n\n\nF Gnostk Concepts, nc\n\n97\n\nFIGURE 3.22\nSPECTRUM OF ULTIMATE DECISION-MAKERS AND INFLUENCES AT PLAY\n\nS0000000\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2~\n\nI\n\n.rg.\n\nCotmttn or\n\nComiltees\nwulti\'ple\n\nC banw of\n(Act\n\nAnalyss\n\nROA\n\na Screen,\n\nFuncti)\n\nmltt\nCvyR\noV\n\nPF\n\n.ol tkat size rlk\ny p jections\n,\ntTeonol\n\nl.\xe2\x80\xa2 t\n\nSCor\n\nI\n\ntoftti/shore of\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2~~ /se tO enter\nV\ns\n\nstff Members\n\nROLE OF "CHAMPION"\n\nIN DECISION MAKING\n\nNo proposed idea will attract investment money unless there\n\nis a strong, well-respected individual or "champion" within the\n\norganization to push for investment consideration. This is true\n\nregardless of company size and complexity.\n\nThe role of the "champion" is to be the spokesman for the\n\ninvestment concept. It is the "champion\'s" function to gather\n\ntogether all of the necessary information and to see that it is\n\npresented in its most favorable light to influence a positive\n\ndecision in the investment environment. While the "champion" may\n\nnot do all of the actual work, it is still that person\'s responsi\xc2\xad\nbility to see.that the necessary elements are brought together in\n\nthe proper form to influence the decision.\n\n\n8\n98\n\nGmCnstk Concepts Inc.\n\nt\n\nr\nts\n\nte\n\nt,<te\nt\n\n"CHAMPION" IMAGE IS IMPORTANT\nThe "champion\'s" personal\n\nrelationship with the final authority may be the overlying influence\n\nin the entire decision process. A "champion" with a weak background\n\nor a tendency to be overoptimistic will cause the group to discount\n\nmuch of the quantitative information. Conversely, if a "champion"\n\nhas an excellent reputation and political stature within the company,\n\nquite often the quantitative information may be regarded in a more\n\nfavorable light than would otherwise.\n\nThe influence of the "champion" will also have a significant\n\neffect upon how the qualitative issues are viewed. Qualitative\n\nissues are always associated with judgments and opinions. A strong\n\n"champion" can positively influence the position of each decision\xc2\xad\nmaker in regard to marginal qualitative issues. Conversely, a weak\n\n"champion" may not be able to counter some of the more significant\n\nqualitative issues and will therefore be dominated by the final\n\ndecision group.\n\n\nROLE OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IN DECISION-MAKING\n\nThe quantitative analysis covers the analytical aspects of\n\nthe venture description. It covers all of the items that can be\n\nquantitatively described and presented in standard format. This\n\nusually is centered around the financial-aspects of the investment.\n\nIt will be part of the overall business plan, which shows how the\n\nnew venture is to be implemented and its various phases of\n\ndevelopment.\n\nFrom company to company, the details will vary, but it may\n\nalso include a proposed description of the facilities, such as size\n\nand location, and the staffing requirements on an annual basis. As\n\na minimum, it will cover the required invesment on an annual basis,\n\nexpected revenues, discounted cash flow analysis, standardized return\n\non investment or return on assets analysis, and some sensitivity\n\nanalysis relating to various market penetration scenarios.\n\nANALYSIS REQUIREMENT DEPENDS ON INVESTMENT AND GROUP SIZE\n\nThe degree of quantitative analysis usually increases as the size of\n\nthe requested investment increases, since the risk also increases\n\nsignificantly. The larger the investment requested, the more\n\nanalysis is devoted toward sensitivity analysis to determine what\n\nthe truly key elements are that will affect the end result of the\n\ninvestment.\n\nTo a certain extent, the quantity of analytical analysis\n\nrequired will also increase as the number of members in the final\n\ndecision group increases. This is based on the fact that as the size\n\nof the group increases, there is a tendency for various members to\n\nspecialize in certain areas. As a result, they will ask pertinent\n\n\nF= GnostcConcepts Inc\n\n99\n\nquestions in their area of expertise that may not be asked if the\n\ngroup were of a smaller size. Consequently, the supporting division\n\na\n\nand "champion" of the proposed idea must be prepared to answer \n\nlarge variety of questions and to support them with as much\n\nanalytical analysis as possible.\n\nA very important note-to\n\nANALYSIS USED TO RANK ALTERNATIVES\nmade is that the quantitative analysis i generally used as a\n\nbe\nscreening procedure rather than a decision procedure. A proposed\n\nventure analysis will not be eliminated from consideration because\n\nof the results of the analytical analysis. Many proposed investments\n\ndo not meet the minimum requirements of a company for making an\n\ninvestment. However, due to the strong capabilities of the\n\n"champion" or certain overriding nonanalytical issues, an investment\n\nproposal will still be brought to the attention of the corporate\n\ndecision staff for consideration.\n\nThe real purpose of the quantitative analysis is to be able\n\nto rank the various investment opportunities that are made available\n\nto a company throughout the year. Through the use of certain\n\nstandard analytical procedures, all investments can be put on a\n\ncommon footing so that a one-to-one comparison of each of the\n\nproposed investments can be made.\n\nThe results of the quantitative\n\nANALYSIS CAN BE OVERRULED\nanalysis can be overruled or ignored, whether favorable or not.\n\nThere may be many overriding issues that will cause a company to make\n\nan investment when the financial analysis is not totally in compli\xc2\xad\nance with that normally required for an investment. For instance,\n\nif a company can make an investment in a given opportunity and\n\nthrough that investment can attract dollars, possibly government\n\ndollars, into development areas in other locations of their company,\n\nthen they may consider making the investment, even though the\n\nanalytical analysis indicates that it is not the best possible use\n\nof those particular investment dollars.\n\nConversely, a company may decide not to make an investment,\n\neven though the analytical analysis indicates that it would be a\n\nreasonable investment. For example, it may be that the investment\n\nwould be in an area in which there would be significant interaction\n\nwith government agencies and by nature this may have been tradition\xc2\xad\nally an area which the company has avoided. Consequently, even\n\nthouph it may be a good investment from an analytical analysis view\xc2\xad\npoint, it will not be pursued because of the company\'s management\n\nphilosophy.\n\nIn summary, the quantitative analysis provides a foundation\n\nupon which companies can compare available and competing opportuni\xc2\xad\nties for investment. It does not necessarily eliminate a potential\n\ninvestment from consideration, but it will provide insight as to what\n\nadditional information and reasoning must be required to justify a\n\npositive final decision.\n\n\n100\n\nF\n\nnostikConcepts. Inc\n\nHANDLING OF QUALITATIVE ISSUES\n\nThe qualitative issues are those that cannot necessarily be\n\npresented analytically and placed in a quantitative format. These\n\nare typically the nonfinancial issues that must be recognized and\n\nconsidered on the basis of their potential impact. Often these\n\nissues represent the high-risk aspects of an investment.\n\nQualitative issues would include discussions on such items as\n\nthe role of the government in the development of the industry. Is\n\nthat role known, and what influence will it have upon the investment\n\nif a change in that expected role occurs? Other items would include\n\nthe best timing for market entry; which major markets are best\n\nserved; compatibility with corporate resources and objectives;\n\nstrengths and weaknesses of competition; effective channels of\n\ndistribution; relative size of domestic versus foreign marketplace;\n\nand many other issues. These issues are often a matter of judgment,\n\nopinion, or "gut" feel. Even if they are quantitatively presented,\n\nmore often than not there is significant room for disagreement among\n\nvarious "experts" within the company.\n\nCOMPANY IMAGE IS QUALITATIVE ISSUE\nQualitative issues also\n\ncover the area of company image. Is it an advantage or a disadvan\xc2\xad\ntage for the company to be in this particular investment area. Even\n\nif it appears to be a financially solid area in which to invest, it\n\nmay be that governmental pressure or public opinion would be against\n\na company moving into a certain area of investment. On the other\n\nhand, a company may be able to justify an investment in a marginal\n\narea because they will gain significant advantage through public\n\nrelation avenues, and it may enhance their ability to sell other\n\nproducts that they already produce or attract additional government\n\ncontracts that they might not otherwise obtain.\n\nQUALITATIVE ISSUE CAN DOMINATE\nThe discussions around the\n\nqualitative issues can often dominante the entire final investment\n\ndecision process. This is especially true if the quantitative\n\nanalysis is marginal in comparison to the desired minimum require\xc2\xad\nments of the corporation. It is in these cases that the interaction\n\nof the "champion" and the members of the ultimate decision-making\n\ngroup is very important. The relative knowledge of these final\n\ndecision-makers and that of the "champion" on these qualitative\n\nissues may have the most dominant effect upon the investment\n\ndecision.\n\n\n= Gnostic Concepts.

There will be certain common denomi\xc2\xad\nnators permeating all of the successful photovoltaic-oriented\n\ncompanies of the future. There will, however, be wide variations\n\naround each of these common denominators from company to company.\n\nThrough the discussion of these common characteristics of the\n\nfuture viable photovoltaic-oriented companies, a background will be\n\npresented by which present-day companies, both in and out of the\n\nphotovoltaic venture, can be analyzed. Through this method, conclu\xc2\xad\nsions can be drawn concerning those present-day companies that would\n\nhave a more optimum chance of being successful and enhance the\n\npossibilities for the overall national goals concerning the indus\xc2\xad\ntrialization of the photovoltaic venture. Identification of other\n\nless optimum companies could result in having their potential\n\nenhanced through certain government actions, thus increasing the\n\nbase of the number of companies capable of participating in the\n\nindustrialization process.\n\nNot only is this intended to assist in expanding the number\n\nof potential companies in the industrialization process, but it is\n\nalso intended to give insight into what government actions should\n\nnot be taken that might eliminate certain present-day companies from\n\nthe industrialization process. By understanding the characteristics\n\nof the future viable photovoltaic companies, the government actions\n\ncan be better designed and can avoid undesirable biasing of the\n\nfuture complexion of the photovoltaic industry.\n\n\nSTAYING POWER\n\nThe staying power of a company refers to its financial ability\n\nto support a long-range development program in the photovoltaic\n\nventure. Most present-day financial analyses of the photovoltaic\n\nventure indicate that short-term profits are not likely to occur,\n\nand in fact only marginal profits during the intermediate time are\n\n\n102\n\nFCnosti Concepts Inc\n\npossible. The long-term potential, however, of the photovoltaic\n\nventure is extremely optimistic. Thus to survive during the early\n\nand intermediate stages of the photovoltaic venture, a company must\n\nhave the financial resources available to sustain its operation and\n\nsupport the research and development activities required.\n\nINDUSTRY TREND DEVELOPING\nA significant and notable trend\n\nis already taking place within the photovoltaic venture. Small\n\ncompanies are formed based on technological capabilities and venture\n\ncapital. Ultimately, these companies find that they can no longer\n\nfinance the venture and begin seeking additional infusion of capital.\n\nIf this is not done, the company ultimately loses market share and\n\nbecomes a low-growth company. The source of the capital infusion\n\nhas come primarily from large, multi-billion-dollar corporations\n\nwhich see the opportunities within photovoltaics but do not have\n\ninternally the technological or production expertise to pursue the\n\nventure. Thus these large corporations have sought out these small\n\ntechnologically based companies which need capital financing.\n\nThere is no reason to think that this trend will not continue\n\nover the next five years. Few if any small companies will survive\n\nin the photovoltaic venture. Those that do survive will be based\n\nstrictly on having found some unique niche in which they are capable\n\nof supplying specialized products to special markets with special\n\nneeds but will in no way be able to supply the large quantity of\n\nproducts at the prices required for the bulk energy requirements of\n\nthis nation.\n\nSIMILAR DEVELOPMENT IN SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY\nThis route is\n\ncommmon even within the semiconductor industry of today. During the\n\n1960s, many semiconductor companies were formed with venture capital.\n\nHowever, in the 1970s many of these companies went out of business\n\nor were absorbed by larger corporations, principally the large\n\ncomputer companies and, more recently, large system companies from\n\nEurope. For those companies that have not been absorbed by larger\n\ncorporations, they have remained in business by aligning themselves\n\nwith large customers and in effect have formed a "marriage" rela\xc2\xad\ntionship. The smaller semiconductor companies surviving today supply\n\nspecial products to system companies or have a significant share of\n\ntheir business being devoted to custom products that are not high\n\nenough in volume to interest the larger semiconductor companies.\n\nThe remaining large semiconductor companies have found that\n\nsurvival can only be through a vertical integration move in which\n\nthey have evolved into producing subsystems and system products which\n\nconsume large quantitites of their captively built semiconductor\n\nproducts, However, only the most profitable of the semiconductor\n\ncompanies have been able to finance this vertical integration\n\nmovement.\n\n\nGostktconcepts. Inc\n\n103\n\nFINANCIAL BACKING KEY TO SURVIVAL\nThus one of the key\n\nelements of a future viable photovoltaic company will be its ability\n\nto obtain significant financial backing. In effect, the multi\xc2\xad\nbillion-dollar corporations of today will be the ultimate viable\n\nphotovoltaic-oriented companies of the future. It will be these\n\ncompanies that will set industry trends and directions, with the\n\nsmaller photovoltaic companies surviving based on finding special\n\nniches in which they can participate.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY BASE\n\nA key element of a viable photovoltaic-oriented company is\n\nits technology base. It must include the capabilities to continually\n\ninvestigate many avenues for technological breakthroughs on a long\xc2\xad\nterm basis. This applies not only to the solar cell device itself,\n\nbut also to the packaging technologies associated with photovoltaic\n\nproducts.\n\nTECHNOLOGY MUST BE IN-HOUSE\nThis technology base must be\n\nwithin the confines of the company. The long-term viable photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic companies cannot rely upon having the technology made avail\xc2\xad\nable to them through the public domain, even though government\n\nactivities will attempt to provide that technology through such\n\navenues. There must be in-house capability to develop independently\n\nthe technology base required for long-term survival. It will be\n\ncomplemented by the information and the transfer of technology that\n\nis developed through government activities and research contracts in\n\nthe public domain.\n\nTECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT PROVIDES SHORT-LIVED ADVANTAGE\n\nThe photovoltaic industry will be a high-technology-oriented\n\nindustry. Traditionally throughout the culture of the United States,\n\nhigh-technology industries have always had associated with them a\n\nconstant state of flux concerning personnel moving from company to\n\ncompany. The photovoltaic industry is expected to be characterized\n\nby this phenomenon also. The semiconductor industry, which is\n\nconsidered to be one of the high-technology industries in the US, is\n\nalso characterized by this constant state of engineering and\n\ntechnical personnel changing companies.\n\nThe conclusion is that the proprietary nature of a given\n\ntechnology can only remain within the confines of a company for\n\nprobably no more than one year. Through this constant change in\n\npersonnel, the concepts and basic ideas of the technology will be\n\nspread throughout the industry. Thus a proprietary position can be\n\nmaintained only for a limited time within a given company.\n\n\n104\n\nCrosdc Concepts Inc\n\nThis is a principal reason why a company must have long-range\n\ntechnology development programs occurring at all times because once\n\na technology advantage is obtained, it will only be an advantage for\n\na limited time. Patent rights have not been a successful method by\n\nwhich a semiconductor company has been able to maintain a proprietary\n\nposition. It is not expected to provide any significant protection\n\nwithin the photovolaic industry, either. This is especially true\n\nconsidering the federal government will be applying pressure through\n\nits-policies, actions, and government contracts to have the tech\xc2\xad\nnology base spread among as many companies as possible to enhance\n\nphotovoltaic industrialization.\n\nTECHNOLOGY CAN BE ACQUIRED\nThere does not have to exist a\n\ntechnology base within a given company for it to decide to invest in\n\nthe photovoltaic venture. Because of present-day government actions,\n\nspin-off companies being formed and the constant transfer of\n\npersonnel within high-technology industries, a company desiring to\n\nenter the photovoltaic industry can do so without having an estab\xc2\xad\nlished technology base. It can be acquired through various means,\n\nincluding the acquisition route.\n\nTECHNOLOGY ALONE DOES NOT GUARANTEE SURVIVABILITY\n\nWhile technology can be the link that draws a company into the\n\nphotovoltaic venture, it will not in itself guarantee long-term\n\nsurvivability. If the technology is not pursued aggressively and\n\ntechnological breakthroughs accomplished, the company will find\n\nitself not remaining competitive in future years. Thus companies\n\nentering the photovoltaic venture based strictly upon their present\n\ntechnological expertise may find long-term survivability is still\n\neluding them. Even then it must be coupled with other viable\n\ncharacteristics within the company. Technology alone will only\n\nprovide a temporary benefit.\n\n\nMARKET EXPERTISE\n\nNEED TO UNDERSTAND MARKET CHARACTERISTICS\nAnother important\n\nelement to long-term survivability in the photovoltaic industry will\n\nbe the ability to understand the market anatomy and the requirements\n\nof each major market served. The photovoltaic venture will no doubt\n\ndraw companies into market areas that they have not traditionally\n\nserviced. Each new market area has its own unique characteristics,\n\ntraditional methods of doing business, traditional channels of\n\ndistribution, and required servicing aspects.\n\nIf a company entering a new market sector attempts to estab\xc2\xad\nlish new methods of doing business, they will compound their pene\xc2\xad\ntration problems and increase their marketing cost. Only after\n\nthoroughly understanding how busines is done in a given market area\n\nshould a company attempt to innovate or change those business\n\npractices.\n\n\n2\n\nGnostIc Concepts Inc\n\n105\n\nOne aspect of\n\nPROPER IDENTIFICATION OF CUSTOMERS IMPORTANT\nmarketing expertise is to realize who the real customers are. For\n\nexample, the actual end-user of a component or a piece of equipment\n\nmay purchase it through a distributor. The distributer becomes the\n\ncustomer, not the ultimate end-user. Understanding these channels\n\nof distribution will enhance a company\'s ability to penetrate the\n\nmarket. By violating channels of distribution, a company tends to\n\ncause ill wjll and mistrust not only with the end-user, but with\n\nthose intermedite companies that can introduce them to the\n\nhigh-growth sectors of the new markets.\n\nIn the photovoltaic venture, often the panel suppliers will\n\ndeal with intermediate companies, namely the large functional systems\n\ncompanies, rather than the end-user. It is the identification of\n\nthese large functional system companies and how they do business that\n\nwill be critical to the long-term survivability of a photovoltaic\xc2\xad\noriented company.\n\nVERTICAL INTEGRATION WILL INFLUENCE BUSINESS STRUCTURE\n\nThere are also vertical integration questions thamust be resolved.\n\nIf a photovoltaic panel supplier decides to vertically integrate and\n\nsupply the functional systems that incorporate photovoltaic products,\n\nthen that company must be prepared to implement an entirely new\n\nmarketing approach compared to the selling of just the photovoltaic\n\npanels. The functional systems are sold in an entirely different\n\nfashion than components. If the company is not prepared for this\n\ndifference in the marketing area, then significant delays and high\n\nexpenses may occur before success is obtained.\n\nAt the same time, companies must recognize that the large\n\nsystem suppliers may vertically integrate in a downward fashion,\n\ntaking away from the panel supplier certain added value aspects of\n\ntheir present business. For instance, a panel supplier quite often\n\ntoday supplies not only the photovoltaic panels to a systems company,\n\nbut also specifies the batteries and in some cases even structural\n\nand interconnect material and may completely assemble and install a\n\nphotovoltaic power supply at a given system\'s site.\n\nHowever, as the systems companies become acquainted with how\n\nto design photovoltaic power sources, they will absorb the function\n\nof not only the designing of thepower source, but the acquiring of\n\nthe other components, such as batteries, interconnect material,\n\nstructural material, and will install the power source themselves.\n\nThis will remove certain functions from the panel supplier and the\n\nadded value that the panel supplier was obtaining from supplying\n\nthose components and services.\n\nThe panel supplier must thus be prepared for this inevitable\n\noccurrence. Being able to recognize which market segments are likely\n\nto pursue this downward vertical integration and those that will not\n\npursue it will be a key element in preparing marketing strategies.\n\n\n106\n\nJ Gncbtic Concepts Inc\n\nMUST FORMULATE MARKET STRATEGIES\nFormulating strong\n\nareas of pricing, product definition, product\n\nstrategies in the\ndiversification, and markets to be served will also be a critical\n\nelement in the long-term survivability and profitability of a\n\nphotovoltaic-oriented company. Only if the markets served are\n\nthoroughly understood can such effective strategies be implemented\n\nand maximize the potential profits that. can be realized.\n\nAnother element in marketing strategies will be product guar\xc2\xad\nantees. There must be an understanding of what minimum guarantees\n\nthe market will require and what will the competition supply. In\n\naddition, will foreign suppliers provide greater guarantees than have\n\ntraditionally been required in that marketplace? How is the guaran\xc2\xad\ntee to be supported will also be a critical issue. Will a repair\n\nfunction be provided? Will service personnel call upon the instal\xc2\xad\nlation sites? Will an exchange of product be the manner in which\n\nthe guarantee is backed?\n\nRamifications of the product guarantee policy will influence\n\nwhere inventories are warehoused around the world. Will the panel\n\nsupplier maintain the inventory, or will the systems companies main\xc2\xad\ntain it? Is the systems company to supply all needed services, or\n\nwill the panel supplier have to be responsible for those functions?\n\nThese and many other questions will have to be resolved before a\n\ns\'uccessful venture can be implemented. The best approach in one\n\nmarket area may not comply with the requirements of another market\n\narea.\n\nINTERNATIONAL ISSUES MUST BE DECIDED\nSince the photovoltaic\n\nindustry will be a worldwide industry and a majority of the total\nmarket will be in non-US locations, a company entering the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic industry must decide what international capabilities they\nneed. They must decide whether or not they will attempt to supply\nboth the US domestic market and the international markets.\n\nThe implications of supplying a worldwide market are far\n\ngreater than simply supplying the domestic market. If activities\n\nare restricted to the domestic market, the potential growth of the\n\nenterprise may be seriously restricted and will require a heavy\n\ninvolvement with the US government. A company must decide that this\n\nis acceptable to them. Supplying the international market, however,\n\nincreases the number of competitors, as well as the distribution and\n\nmarketing costs.\n\n\nPOLITICAL SAVVY\n\nThe successful photovoltaic-oriented companies will learn to\n\nwork with a diverse combination of noneconomic elements, such as\n\nbuilding codes, local utilities, government agenicies, insurance\n\n\nGnostic Concepts Inc\n\n107\n\nfirms, and a host of other issues. These items do not necessarily\n\nfall under a company\'s ability to do excellent marketing promotions.\n\nThey fall primarily under the area of how to coordinate a large,\n\ndiverse number of activities and meet a variety of possibly\n\nconflicting requirements. To a certain degree, this requires an\n\nexcellent capability in the public relations area.\n\nGOVERNMENT RELATIONS MUST BE DEVELOPED\nIn the US, the\n\nfederal government will have a significant hand in the development\n\nof the photovoltaic industry. In developing countries, the local\n\ngovernments will have the significant influece on what major\n\nphotovoltaic-powered projects are installed. Throughout the entire\n\nphotovoltaic market there will thus be a continual interaction with\n\ngovernment activities and agencies. There will be no way a\n\nphotovoltaic-oriented company can avoid the interaction with\n\ngovernment policies, restrictions, and requirements.\n\nA successful company will thus have to develop political savvy\n\nin how to deal with these various government contingencies. They\n\nmust recognize that there are political overtones to this industry,\n\nand there will be no way to avoid them. The successful companies\n\nwill have devoted a certain portion of their resources to under\xc2\xad\nstanding and developing relationships with key government agencies\n\nand personnel to maximize their penetration of various market areas.\n\nAs an example, many projects will have a government agency\n\nsupplying the financial backing for the project. The company winning\n\nthe contract will have had to have experience and knowledge in how\n\nto write and present proposals. Historically, the large system\n\ncompanies that have dealt with government agencies in many areas for\n\nyears have been far more successful in understanding the proper\n\nfashion in which to write and present proposals for government\n\ncontracts than most other companies.\n\nEXISTING GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS COULD BE USABLE ASSET\n\nIt can be concluded that those companies that have experience in\n\ndealing with government agencies and supplying government products\n\nwould have the expertise in the political area to be successful in a\n\nphotovoltaic venture. While this experience in itself would not be\n\nsufficient to guarantee long-term survivability, it would represent\n\na valuable asset within the company\'s resources.\n\nIt is not impossible to develop this expertise if it does not\n\npresently exist within the company structure. However, years of\n\nexperience in this area cannot be accumulated overnight or learned\n\nfrom textbook theories or through casual acquaintances with key\n\ngovernment agencies and personnel. It will be a painstaking and\n\nlong-term project for a company to gain political savvy to enhance\n\ntheir position in the photovoltaic venture if it does not already\n\nexist within the company.\n\n\n108\n\ncnstkconcepmt\n\nInc\n\nCHARACTER ISTICS\nOF\nCOMPAN I ES\n\nMOTIVATED\nTO\nINVEST\n\nSEMICONDUCTOR-BASED FIRMS\n\nTECHNOLOGY STRONGEST ASSET\nThe first and most dominant\n\ncharacteristic of the semiconductor-based firms is their tremendous\n\nhigh technology base. This is probably their strongest asset in\n\nrelationship to the photovoltaic venture. These companies have the\n\nlargest accumulated amount of experience in dealing with the basic\n\nsolar cell device materials of any industry or set of companies in\n\nthe US. It is that base of knowledge that has allowed the techno\xc2\xad\nlogical development of present-day terrestrial solar cell products.\n\nBased within most semiconductor companies are both near- and\n\nlong-term research and development programs in the area of device\n\nphysics and material characterization. These companies are well\n\naccustomed to rapid technological advancement.\n\nThe technology base that exists within the semiconductor\n\nindustry is most applicable to only the solar cell devices themselves\n\nand not necessarily applicable to the packaging technologies that\n\nmust be developed in the photovoltaic industry. The semiconductor\n\nindustry is well experienced in the packaging of discrete semi\xc2\xad\nconductor and integrated circuit components. They are not accus\xc2\xad\ntomed, however, to the packaging of large area products or the\n\nhandling of large sheets of glass, plastic, and sheet metal. While\n\nthey are very experienced in sealing techniques to produce hermeti\xc2\xad\ncally sealed or water-resistant products, there is doubt that this\n\nexpertise is directly applicable to the sealing and packaging of\n\nphotovoltaic products.\n\nSTAYING POWER WEAKEST ASSET\nWhile technology is probably\n\nthe semiconductor companies\' strongest asset, it is their financial\n\nstaying power that is probably their weakest asset. By far the\n\nmajority of semiconductor companies are under the half-billion\xc2\xad\ndollar level in annual revenues, and only one company is in the\n\nbillion-dollar range for their semiconductor operations.\n\nTheir financial success has historically been very cyclical\n\nand has been tied directly to the swings in the national economy.\n\nThey are characterized as rapid expansion companies during good\n\neconomic times and have resorted to rapid declines in emp oyment\n\nlevels during low or declining economic conditions. Few if any of\n\nthe companies have acquired sufficient resources and financial power\n\nto maintain production and employment levels, and technical manpower\n\nduring poor or declining economic periods.\n\n\nD\n\nGnostc Concepts. Inc\n\n109\n\nBecause of this lack of financial staying power, the demands\n\nwithin the semiconductor industry require that profits must be\n\ngenerated in the near-term period. If a new venture is to be\n\ncontempated within the semiconductor industry, it must show excellent\n\nnear-term financial return. For instance, within no more than two\n\nyears itmust be a profitable operation, or it will not be considered\n\nat all. Coupled with this is the requirement that the payback period\n\non subsequent investments within those operations must also be less\n\nthan two years, and hopefully less than 1-1/2 years.\n\nBASE BUSINESS FIRST PRIORITY\nIn general, semiconductor\n\ncompanies do not have the staying power to weather both the cyclic\n\nnature of their basic semiconductor business and finance the neces\xc2\xad\nsary capital investments required for a long-term photovoltaic\n\nventure. The semiconductor companies recognize this, and conse\xc2\xad\nquently there have not been any significant number of semiconductor\n\ncompanies entertaining serious thoughts of entering the photovoltaic\n\nventure. The short-term payback and profit potentials simply are\n\nnot attractive enough to even consider such an investment if the\n\nbasic business is to be maintained.\n\nWhat few semiconductor companies have entered the photovolaic\n\nindustry or are considering entering it have done so because of other\n\nmotivations. One of these motivations is that government funding is\n\navailable in the area of material technology development, an area\n\nthat is directly applicable to activities already established within\n\ntheir research and development activities. By having federal funding\n\ndevelop the material technology, the overall investment required by\n\nthe semiconductor companies is thus significantly reduced.\n\nIn addition, the investment in the photovoltaic venture to\n\ndate has not necessarily required the installation of additional\n\nproduction capacity in certain key areas, such as facilities, wafer\n\nproduction, wafer processing, and cell development. Once significant\n\nquantities of capital infusion are required from the company funds\n\ngenerated internally and additional production capacity is required\n\nto sustain the growth of the photovoltaic venture, the semiconductor\n\ncompanies presently in the photovoltaic industry will have to\n\nseriously reconsider what their future strategy and commitments are\n\nto the photovoltaic industry. In no way will they allow the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture to seriously jeopardize their profit position,\n\nespecially if there is a downturn in the nation\'s economic environ\xc2\xad\nment that may cause a retrenching or constriction of the base\n\nsemiconductor business.\n\nMARKETING EXPERTISE LIMITED TO COMPONENT EXPERIENCE\n\nIn addition to the moneys being made available in the material\n\ninvestigation areas, the limited number of semiconductor companies\n\nthat are seriously considering the pursuit of the photovoltaic\n\nventure also have vested interests in functional systems operations\n\n\n110\n\nECntComeptmtnr\n\neither as part of their semiconductor operation or as a separate\n\ndivision of their parent corporation. These functional systems\n\nbusinesses are viewed as a readily available market for any photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic products that may be produced. This affords these semi\xc2\xad\nconductor companies a reduction in the potential investment in\n\nmarketing capabilities that might otherwise have to be developed\n\nfrom scratch.\n\nThe majority of the semiconductor companies\' experience in\n\nthe marketing area, however, has been associated with the marketing\n\nof components and not that of functional systems. Most semiconductor\n\nfirms do not have applicable systems divisions within the same\n\ncorporation that can possibly bridge this area of needed experience.\n\nConsequently, if a semiconductor company does consider the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture, it will most likely consider it from the viewpoint\n\nof supplying a component to a functional systems house. The\n\ncomponent would be either the photovoltaic device cell or a photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic panel. Because of their lack of marketing expertise in the\n\nsystems marketplace, few if any will be interested in the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture. The opportunities for vertical integration into\n\nthe systems business are too restrictive in this particular case\n\ncompared to the opportunities for vertical integration in the\n\nsemiconductor industry.\n\nVERTICAL INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS NOT COMPATIBLE\n\nVertical integration tendencies in the semiconductor industry is\n\nbased on the fact that the products such as minicomputers and\n\ncomputers contain a high degree of semiconductor products, both\n\ndollar-wise and in technology content. That is, a significant\n\ncontribution to the overall system characteristics are provided by\n\nthe semiconductor components. The additional technologies and\n\ncapabilities that must be added in the vertical integration move\n\ninto a completed instrument or a subsystem or a minicomputer is not\n\nas extensive as compared to the semiconductor technology base.\n\nHowever, in the case of a photovoltaic-oriented company\n\ndevoting its efforts toward vertical integration, the case is\n\nentirely different. The photovoltaics represent a relatively small\n\ncontribution to the overall technology base and dollar content of\n\nthe complete functional system.\n\nThus to approach vertical integration from a base of photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic panel manufacturing requires the addition of many manufac\xc2\xad\nturing capabilities, technology inputs, marketing expertise, and\n\nsignificant financial investments. The tendency for vertical\n\nintegration is thus not as great within the photovoltaic-oriented\n\ncompany, as in the case of the semiconductor company. Consequently,\n\nsemiconductor-based companies will tend to stick with those areas in\n\nwhich vertical integration can be easily accomplished and in which\n\nthe semiconductor components contribute a significant portion to the\n\noverall system function. Photovoltaics does not appear to offer that\n\nadvantage to a semiconductor company.\n\n\nF\n\nGnostc Concepts Inc\n\n111\n\nHistorically the\n\nPLANNING HORIZON RELATIVELY SHORT\nsemiconductor companies have not extended plans, objectives, or\n\ngoals beyond a five-year horizon. With very few exceptions, firm,\n\nlong-range strategies are not a commonplace occurrence in the semi\xc2\xad\nconductor industry. Thus with planning not extending beyond the\n\nfive-year horizon, commitment of funds to investments that may\n\nrequire greater than five years to recoup would be intolerable in-a\n\nsemiconductor-based company. The photovoltaic venture today does\n\nnot offer any reliable short-term profits or return on investment\n\nthat is at all compatible with the semiconductor industry planning\n\ncycles and general financial requirements.\n\nMarketing programs, strategies, and deployment of resources\n\nare not geared or oriented toward such long-range planning. The\n\nprincipal reason is that the cyclic nature of the nation\'s economy\n\ntremendously affects the operational nature of the semiconductor\n\nindustry. They simply cannot afford to commit their resources to\n\nsuch long-range firm commitments as is required within the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic industry without seriously jeopardizing their base business\n\nposture. There are exceptions to all of these cases within the\n\nsemiconductor industry and there is a tendency for such companies to\n\nbegin looking beyond the five-year horizon; however, these are very\n\nlimited exceptions and can be scuttled, dropped or changed if any\n\nserious economic conditions develop.\n\nThere has been a tendency for\n\nNEW MARKETS CAUSE PROBLEMS\nthe semiconductor companies to fail to understand new markets. Often\n\nnew markets are approached with the same philosophy, product supply\n\nchannels, and methods of operation as have traditionally worked in\n\nsupplying components to the computer-oriented marketplace.\n\nAn example of the semiconductor industry failing to understand\n\nthe characteristics of the market is exemplified by their approach\n\nto the consumer electronics business, especially the watch industry.\n\nVirtually all of the American semiconductor companies have experi\xc2\xad\nenced a failure at the digital watch market due to a lack of under\xc2\xad\nstanding of methods of distribution, financing, and consumer desires.\n\nThe semiconductor companies will have tremendous marketing\n\nproblems in entering markets served by the photovoltaic venture\n\nunless they are willing to adapt to the traditional methods of doing\n\nbusiness within those marketplaces. Each marketplace will have its\n\nown special characteristics. The marketing expertise of semi\xc2\xad\nconductor companies is not broadly based enough in most cases at the\n\npresent time to comprehend and encompass all of the many and varied\n\nmarketing conditions that will have to be met by photovoltaic\xc2\xad\noriented companies. Those that learn to adapt to this condition will\n\nhave significantly increased potential for long-term survivability,\n\nbut it will be a stress on most semiconductor companies\' financial\n\nand marketing resources.\n\n\n112\n\nF\n\nGnosti Concepts Inc\n\nINTERNATIONAL ASPECTS NOT A SEVERE LIMITATION\n\nThe photovoltaic venture wil require companies to operate in the\n\ninternational domain. The bulk of the sales at the panel level will\n\nbe to the functional systems firms throughout the world. These firms\n\nare gen~rally located in the industrialized nations of the world,\n\nwhile the final installation of the photovoltaic products will in\n\nmost cases be in developing countries.\n\nThe sale of the product through the first channels of\n\ndistribution will be in the industrialized countries. Here the\n\nsemiconductor companies have compatible distribution and marketing\n\nmethods. They are accustomed to doing business in virtually all of\n\nthe industrialized nations and are well aware of the existence of\n\nthe functional systems firms, their locations, and some information\n\non the types of products they buy. For this reason, the semi\xc2\xad\nconductor industry would have an advantage over other types of\n\ncompanies that are not accustomed to doing international business.\n\nThe US semiconductor firms also have manufacturing plants in\n\nEurope, the Orient, and South America. This could become a great\n\nasset if manufacturing of photovoltaic products is required within\n\ncertain countries to attract the business that is available there.\n\nNew small photovoltaic companies being formed would not be able to\n\ndistribute their product as cost-effectively in these industrialized\n\nnations as would the semiconductor-based companies that already have\n\nmanufacturing, distribution, and marketing connections within such\n\ncountries.\n\nGOVERNMENT RELATIONS NOT OPTIMUM\nThe semiconductor industry\n\nhas historically viewed the federal government as a restrictive force\n\nupon their industry rather than an ally. The nature of the semi\xc2\xad\nconductor business requires great flexibility to react to both\n\ncompetition and market conditions. In effect, the semiconductor\n\ncompanies tend to feel they cannot control their own destiny if they\n\nare within a market where the government has the dominant influence.\n\nDuring the early years of development of the semiconductor\n\nindustry, the federal government played a key role in that they were\n\na major purchaser of semiconductor products. However, the commercial\n\nventures became far more attractive for the semiconductor companies,\n\nand they have consequently concentrated on these particular markets\n\nduring the last fifteen years.\n\nThey still continue to do business with the government\n\nagencies, but such business is not a dominant portion of their\n\noverall business position. Virtually all sales to government\n\nagencies require a tremendous amount of paperwork, traceability,\n\nadditional steps deemed unnecessary by the semiconductor industry,\n\nand in general a lack of flexibility in moving inventory and\n\nresources.\n\n\n2Cnstc Concpts Inc\n\n113\n\nThe semiconductor industry has not learned to deal with the\n\ngovernment agencies in a fashion that causes them to be viewed as an\n\nally or as a positive aspect in their overall business. The govern\xc2\xad\nment\'s presence in the photovoltaic venture will be significant if\n\nnot totally dominant for at least the next five to ten years. In\n\ngeneral, this would act as a restrictive force in encouraging\n\nsemiconductor companies to enter the photovoltaic venture.\n\nSUMMARY OF ASSETS AND DEFICITS\nIn summary, those assets that\n\nthe semiconductor industry has that would benefit or aid them in the\n\nphotovoltaic venture would include:\n\n* High technology base\n\ne Capability to market internationally to systems companies\n\n* International manufacturing experience\n\nThese assets, however, are offset by certain negative tendencies,\n\nwhich include:\n\n* Limited financial staying power\n\n* Lack of a firm and positive relationship with government\n\nagencies\n\n* Lack of marketing experience in a large number of markets\n\n* Inadequate long-range planning practices\n\nTo induce semiconductor companies into the photovoltaic\n\nventure, the objectives of the government actions and policies should\n\nbe to reduce the financial requirement of the photovoltaic venture,\n\ndevelop a working relationship with the semiconductor industry, leave\n\nthe industry capable of determining their own destiny, and to inform\n\nthem of marketing practices, distribution channels, and other\n\npertinent information concerning new markets that will be required\n\nin the photovoltaic venture.\n\n\nPETROCHEMICAL FIRMS\n\nThe petrochemical firms are the large US oil companies; those\n\nresponsible for supplying the nation with the various forms of oil,\n\nfuel oil, gasoline, and the many biproducts of the oil industry.\n\nGREATEST ASSET IS STAYING POWER\nIn relationship to the\n\nphotovoltaic venture, one of the greatest assets that these companies\n\noffer is their tremendous staying power. Their financial resources\n\nare among the largest and most broadly based of any grouping of\n\nindustrial firms within the United States.\n\n\n1\n\n114\n\nCnost cConceptslnc.\n\nBecause of their tremendous staying power, they are prepared\n\nto meet the requirements of firm long-range, plans and strategies.\n\nBy long-range plans it is meant planning in excess of a ten-year\n\nhorizon and as far out as a twentyto twenty-five-year horizon. This\n\nstyle or type of long-range planning is standard operating procedure\n\nwithin this industry.\n\nIf the long-range potential is sufficient, then the short\xc2\xad\nterm prospects will not restrict such companies from making the\n\nnecessary investments and devotion of resources that may be required\n\nwithin the photovoltaic venture. This does not mean that there will\n\nbe a total disregard for the short-term operational procedures, but\n\nit will not act as a restrictive element as in the case of the\n\nsemiconductor industry.\n\nMARKETING EXPERTISE BROADLY BASED\nThe marketing expertise\n\nrequired in dealing with a spectrum of widely varying market\n\nconditions is well developed within the oil companies. They are\n\naccustomed to international marketing, manufacturing, and\n\ndistribution.\n\nThey not only have distribution channels within the\n\nindustrialized countries but also have similar capabilities within\n\nthe developing countries, or at least access to such potential\n\nchannels. The movement of raw material and products from one loca\xc2\xad\ntion to another throughout the entire international scene is an\n\neveryday occurrence for these companies. The development of special\n\nproducts and special packaging is also common within these companies\n\nfor a wide variety of market conditions. The concept of handling a\n\nlarge number of different types of products as well as the distribu\xc2\xad\ntion of such products will be a valuable asset to these companies\n\nwithin the photovoltaic venture.\n\nThe diversification of this industry is extremely broad based,\n\nranging from mining to farming operations, controls, electronics,\n\noffice equipment, biologically based operations, and a host of many\n\nother areas of endeavor. While no one oil company is this widely\n\ndiversified, each is still significantly more diverse in its\n\noperation than compared to semiconductor-oriented companies.\n\nGOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS MIXED\nThe oil companies over many\n\ndecades have learned to develop political savvy, both domestically\n\nand internationally. While it has been extensive in nature, it is\n\nnot altogether totally positive. Especially domestically, there is\n\nstill a lack of trust on their part that the US federal government\n\nwill continue to be supportive of their actions. Their relationship\n\ncould be described as one of appeasement and compromise rather than\n\nan- aggressive partnership with the government.\n\nIt is because of this fear concerning a lack of continued\n\nsupport or an increasing restrictive nature that the significant\n\ndiversification programs have been implemented within these\n\n\n2\n\nGnostic Concepts, Inc\n\n115\n\ncompanies. The oil firms recognize that in the future the oil\n\nindustry will become far more controlled and restricted by government\n\nregulations. Consequently, to protect their stockholders and\n\ninvestment and to assure a continued high-growth future perspective,\n\nthe diversification in other industries was begun. Industries are\n\nselected that represented both high growth and a lack of government\n\ninvolvement. This should not be interpreted as meaning they will\'\n\navoid an industry in which the government is heavily involved, but\n\nit will have to offer significant long-term, high-growth potential\n\nto attract them.\n\nTECHNOLOGY BASE WEAKEST ASSET\nWhile staying power, marketing\n\nexpertise, and the ability to handle government relationships are\n\nstrong assets of the oil companies, without doubt their weakest asset\n\nin relationship to the photovoltaic venture is their technology base.\n\nThis is almost the complete opposite of the semiconductor picture.\n\nThe development of the technology base within the oil\n\ncompanies, however, is on an aggressive corrective path. As previ\xc2\xad\nously mentioned, technology can be brought into a company\'s resources\n\nthrough either internal development or the acquisition route. Both\n\nof these avenues are being pursued by the oil companies. Since the\n\nsolar cell device technology is the most widely known and publicized\n\nand through being diversified into the electronics industry, it has\n\nbeen a relatively easy job for any oil company to obtain the required\n\ntechnology expertise.\n\nIn the packaging of these solar cells, the oil companies\n\nappear, however, to have no tremendous advantage or disadvantage\n\ncompared to the semiconductor industry. Due to their large diversi\xc2\xad\nfication program, they do hold the potential of resolving packaging\n\nproblems more readily than most other firms would.\n\nVERTICAL INTEGRATION BEING CONSIDERED\nThe vertical\n\nintegration issues for the oil companies are very similar to those\n\npreviously discussed for the semiconductor companies, except that\n\nthe oil companies do have the financial resources to accomplish any\n\nvertical integration program that they may deem critical to the\n\nsuccess of their photovoltic program. At present, those oil\n\ncompanies participating in the photovoltaic venture have been\n\nsatisfied with manufacturing photovoltaic panels and supplying the\n\nother required components to produce a photovoltaic-powered power\n\nsupply for various applications.\n\nEach one is, however, seriously looking at what the prospects\n\nand the requirements are for a vertical integration step into the\n\nfunctional systems area. Some are better prepared for this vertical\n\nintegration step because of other diversification programs that have\n\npreceded the investment in the photovoltaic venture. None, however,\n\nare completely aligned with a readily available division or subsidi\xc2\xad\nary that would allow a direct vertical integration movement at the\n\n\n116\n\nqCnosdc Concepts Inc.\n\npresent time. The continuation of their diversification program,\n\nhowever, could bring about the acquisition of a functional systems\n\ncompany that may have direct requirements for photovoltaic power\n\nsupplies.\n\nTECHNOLOGY BASE EXISTS IN OTHER COMPONENT AREAS\nMany oil\n\ncompanies have technology development activities occurring in areas\n\nsuch as batteries that could be applied directly to the photovoltaic\n\nventure. To date, the bulk of the battery technology activities\n\nhave been directed toward the electric vehicle, load-leveling func\xc2\xad\ntions, and consumer products. However, such efforts could be\n\nredirected toward the photovoltaic venture if and when a significant\n\ntechnological breakthrough is envisioned.\n\nAnother major component of future photovoltaic systems will\n\nbe the power conditioning electronics involved in such systems as\n\nresidential, electric utilities, commercial, and institutional\n\nfacilities. Most of the efforts in power conditioning to date within\n\nthe oil companies have been devoted primarily to the simpler systems\n\nthat may apply directly to present-day applications in the communi\xc2\xad\ncations, cathodic protection, and water pumping areas. Additional\n\nefforts and resources are being devoted to power conditioning, but\n\nnot to the degree and intensity of the battery and solar cell device\n\ndevelopments. The prospects and the capabilities, however, do exist\n\nfor elaborate technology efforts in this area within the oil\n\ncompanies.\n\nOIL COMPANIES POSSIBLY BEST EQUIPPED FOR PHOTOVOLTAIC VENTURE\n\nThe US oil companies bring many valuable assets to the photovoltaic\n\nventure. Excellent expertise in virtually all areas of tne previ\xc2\xad\nously described viable photovoltaic companies are met by the oil\n\ncompanies, with the exception of the technology base. The develop\xc2\xad\nment of the technology base, however, is rapidly being acquired,\n\nespecially in the area of the semiconductor-oriented portion of the\n\nphotovoltaic products.\n\nIt would thus appear to be in the best interest of the\n\nnational goals to continue to encourage these oil companies to\n\nproceed at a rapid pace in the development of a complete photovoltaic\n\nventure. It is not, however, necessarily in the interest of small\n\nbusiness to encourage these large corporations, but the ultimate\n\nphotovoltaic venture is not and cannot be considered a small business\n\naffair. Small businesses should be encouraged to develop, but with\n\nthe idea that they will ultimately either be bought out by large\n\nmulti-billion-dollar corporations or they will satisfy the relatively\n\nsmall but profitable special requirements within special market\n\nareas. Such small businesses cannot effectively, efficiently, or\n\neconomically supply the vast quantities of photovoltaic products\n\nthat will be required to resolve any national energy requirements or\n\neven a portion thereof. Of the available industry types, the\n\noil-producing companies bring the greatest number of assets in a\n\n\nEl Gstc Concepts Inc\n\n117\n\nwell-developed form to the forefront of the photovoltaic venture.\n\nIt would require fewer government actions and policies to complete\n\nthe entire resources required by these companies to industrialize\n\nthe photovoltaic venture.\n\nPHOTOVOLTAIC VENTURE NOT ATTRACTIVE TO ALL OIL COMPANIES\n\nNot all oil companies will find the photovoltaic venture attractive,\n\nregardless of what government actions are taken. A principal reason\n\nwill be that the product requirements are too diverse from the\n\noverall corporate objectives of their diversification programs.\n\nAnother reason for not pursuing the photovoltaic venture will\n\nbe the fear that the presence of the federal government in such a\n\ndominant role will cause this industry to become just as regulated\n\nand restrictive as are the perceived prospects for the oil industry.\n\nConsequently, they will be seeking areas of investments that will be\n\noutside of the energy-oriented business, such as electronics,\n\nmedicine, consumer products, and business equipment.\n\n\nMATERIAL-ORIENTED FIRMS\n\nReference here is being made to those material suppliers\n\nprincipally in the silicon business. Additional materials companies\n\nthat could show interest in the photovoltaic venture are those\n\nsuppliers of other basic materials that may be used in the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic products. Such companies would include suppliers of\n\naluminum, glass, gallium, cadmium, plastics, and various materials\n\nfor encapsulation.\n\nTECHNOLOGY BASE VARIED BUT GENERALLY DEFICIENT\n\nThe technology base for these companies is associated with their\n\nability to characterize, produce, and distribute basic materials that\n\nwill be used in the photovoltaic venture. Their technology base may\n\nnot necessarily be in the solar cell device area. This is especially\n\ntrue when considering their ability at the production aspects of\n\nsolar cell devices as compared to the semiconductor companies.\n\nThe packaging aspects of the photovoltaic venture are even\n\nfurther removed from their basic area of expertise in technology and\n\nmanufacturing. There are those material firms, however, that are\n\nvery diverse and include material capabilities in other areas that\n\nthey could draw upon to develop the necessary packaging capabilities.\n\nThis is similar to the oil companies through their diversification\n\nprograms.\n\nBecause of the high technology content devoted to solar cell\n\ndevice manufacturing capability, the present-day photovoltaic\n\nproducts have not attracted the materials companies to the forefront.\n\nThis area of endeavor appears to be incompatible with presently\n\ndeveloped technology skills and expertise.\n\n\n118\n\nF=Cnosdc Concepts, Inc\n\nFUTURE HOLDS MORE FAVORABLE PROSPECTS\nFuture photovoltaic\n\nproducts, however, may offer a more attractive picture to these\n\ncompanies, especially once the technology has been reasonably\n\nstabilized and the products demand the capability of large-area\n\nproduction and handling of basic materials. This is especially true\n\nof the glass, aluminum, plastic, and other nonsemiconductor-oriented\n\nmaterial companies.\n\nThe acquisition of the cell technology could very well be\n\naccomplished through the joint venture, acquisition, or internal\n\ndevelopment routes. The joint venture route has been and will\n\ncontinue to be the route in which the glass, plastic, aluminum, and\n\nnonsemiconductor companies acquire the necessary expertise in the\n\nphotovoltaic venture. The silicon and semiconductor-oriented\n\nmaterial firms will choose the internal development or acquisition\n\nroute as their means of acquiring the necessary technology. Emphasis\n\nwill probably be upon the internal development route.\n\nMARKETING EXPERTISE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PHOTOVOLTAIC VENTURE\n\nThe marketing capabilities of these material-oriented companies\n\nvaries dependi,ng upon which material dominates the company. The\n\nsilicon and other semiconductor material firms have developed\n\nmarketing expertise devoted to the steel, aluminum, and semiconductor\n\nindustries, with the semiconductor industry being the smaller market\n\nserviced. The nonsemiconductor-oriented materials companies have\n\ndeveloped a larger customer base and a larger number of markets\n\nserved than have the semiconductor materials companies.\n\nThe materials firms have devoted their marketing expertise to\n\nmeeting the needs of basic industries rather than the systems\n\ncompanies. Thus the photovoltaic venture would require the develop\xc2\xad\nment of marketing expertise to customers and market segments that\n\nthese firms are not traditionally accustomed to servicing. Their\n\nability to meet the requirements of these new markets is relatively\n\nuntested. In addition, they have not been known for their dynamic\n\nand aggressive pursuite of new markets. This is not to say that they\n\ncannot accomplish this function. Many of the material companies are\n\nowned by larger multi-billion-dollar parent companies that have\n\ntremendous resources through diversification programs that could\n\nbring a base of accumulated experience to bear upon their ability to\n\nmarket to new areas.\n\nMAIN RESTRICTION IS PRODUCTS TOO DIVERSE\nThe most likely\n\nrestriction of tnese companies in tter pursuit of the photovoltaic\n\nventure will be an incompatibility of the photovoltaic products and\n\nthe markets to be served with overall corporate objectives. Most\n\nare not systems-oriented, nor are accustomed to adding additional\n\ncomponents to their products to enhance their sales.\n\n\nM Gnosttc Concepts Inc.\n\n119\n\nINTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE OFFERS LITTLE BENEFIT \n\nMany of the\n\nmaterials firms are international in scope as far as sales and\n\ndistribution capabilities are concerned. Few, however, have inter\xc2\xad\nnational manufacturing capabilities or a tendency to develop them.\n\nWhere international manufacturing capability has been developed, it\n\nhas been more closely aligned with the nonsemiconductor material\n\ncompanies. Where international manufacturing has been established,\n\nit has been for the purpose of supporting basic industries within\n\nthose countries rather than serving new markets or functional\n\nsystems-oriented companies.\n\nLONG-TERM PROSPECT ALONG LINES OF SUPPLIER TO PHOTOVOLTAIC FIRMS\n\nTo date, most materials firms have been satisfied with simply\n\nsupplying materials to the photovoltaic industry rather than making\n\ncompleted photovoltaic products. This does not mean that they have\n\nnot considered the photovoltaic venture. Several have made signifi\xc2\xad\ncant investments internally in the photovoltaic venture, pursued\n\njoint ventures, or have been heavily involved in government\n\ndevelopmental contracts.\n\nThe long-term attraction to the materials companies is that\n\nultimately a significant business could possibly be developed in\n\nsupplying basic raw materials to the photovoltaic industry. None\n\nenvision the photovoltaic materials business as a stand-alone\n\nbusiness. It must be viewed as an additional market to be serviced,\n\nas \nits future potential does not justify the investment in new\n\nfacilities and equipment, especially in the short-to intermediate\xc2\xad\nterm future. Long-term prospects may ultimately alter this position.\n\nPOLITICAL SAVVY COULD BE DEVELOPED\nSince the major business\n\nactivities of material companies is primarily serving basic\n\nindustries of industrialized countries, the need for the development\n\nof political savvy has not necessarily been a major part of their\n\nprevious business activities. It has not necessarily been needed,\n\nbut at the same time it does not appear to be beyond their\n\ncapabilities of developing.\n\nBecause they are aligned with supplying basic industries of\n\nindustrialized countries, they are generally looked upon in a favor\xc2\xad\nable light by the national governments of the various countries in\n\nwhich they do business and in general are not viewed in a negative\n\nfashion by the public. The pursuit of the political savvy required\n\nwithin the photovoltaic venture would be upon the basis of developing\n\nit on a partnership basis with the government agencies and the\n\nvarious governmental bodies, since no fear of the government\n\ndominates their thinking, as in the case of the oil companies.\n\n\n120\n\nECnoskConcep\n\nInc\n\nSTAYING POWER AVAILABLE\nIn most cases, the financial staying\n\npower is available within the materials companies. It is not always\n\nobvious, but it must be remembered that these material companies are\n\ngenerally part of a multi-billion-dollar corporation. The key to\n\nthe use of those financial resources, however, is in the perceived\n\ncompatibility of the photovoltaic venture with the normal corporate\n\nobjectives.\n\nIt has been and will continue to be very difficult to lure\n\nthese conservative materials-oriented companies into market areas\n\nthat are very divergent from their basic business. Those material\n\nfirms that are part of corporations with diversification objectives\n\nwill be the most optimum companies and the most likely to pursue the\n\nphotovoltaic venture.\n\nMATERIAL FIRMS TO PLAY SUPPORTIVE ROLE ONLY\nToo many of\n\nthe critical assets are lacking in developed form to expect the\n\nmaterials companies to play more than just a supportive role in the\n\nphotovoltaic venture, especially with present-day product forms. In\n\nthe long term, when the product form changes and it is more oriented\n\nto the production of large-area sheets of basic materials, there may\n\nbe more compatibility with the mass-production capabilities of these\n\nmaterials companies.\n\nFor the short term, however, there seems to be only a limited\n\nnumber of materials firms that are willing to risk the investment.\n\nIt will be difficult to development government actions and programs\n\nor policies that can overcome the basic conservative viewpoint of\n\nmaterials firms. The constant encouragement of these firms through\n\nthe awarding of governmental developmental projects and contracts\n\nmay be the most productive method of luring these companies into the\n\nphotovoltaic venture.\n\n\nFUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS FIRMS\n\nFrequent reference has been made in previous sections to the\n\nfunctional systems companies as the predominant customer base for\n\nphotovoltaic-oriented products. It is not beyond consideration that\n\nthe functional systems companies may wish to vertically integrate in\n\na downward fashion to incorporate the photovoltaic manufacturing\n\nfunction. The key to this prospect is the level of requirements for\n\nphotovoltaic products within that company.\n\nPROSPECTS VARIED WITH RESPECT TO ENTRANCE\nThe types of\n\ncompanies in this category would include the suppliers of microwave\n\ncbmmunication, cathodic protection, water pumping, controls, energy\n\nstorage, and electric utility equipment. The prospects of these\n\nfunctional systems companies entering the photovoltaic venture is\n\n\nS Cost cConcept\n\nInc\n\n121\n\nextremely varied. Certainly, the bulk of these companies will\n\nultimately find uses for photovoltaics within the products that they\n\nsupply. As a result, there will be a minimum effort toward vertical\n\nintegration in the majority of these companies, especially in the\n\ndownward direction of at least developing the capability to design\n\nphotovoltaic-oriented power sources, and directly obtain the balance\n\nof system components. This function is presently performed by the\n\nphotovoltaic product suppliers.\n\nCAPABILITIES UNCLEAR IN STAYING POWER\nIt is difficult to\n\nidentify any general trends in the area of financial staying power\n\nof these companies. Within each of the general systems categories\n\npreviously mentioned, there is a multitude of various-sized\n\ncompanies. Some are independent companies, while others are owned\n\nby larger corporations. The functional systems aspect of their\n\nbusiness may not be the dominant portion of the company\'s central\n\nbusiness position. There is, however, within each of those basic\n\ncategories those companies that do have the financial resources\n\nto accomplish the photovoltaic venture.\n\nTECHNOLOGY BASE WEAK, JOINT VENTURE OR ACQUISITION NEEDED\n\nThe technology base as it relates to the photovoltaic technology\n\nwithin these companies is usually limited or nonexistent, as their\n\nfunction has not been the development of power sources but rather\n\nthe use of them. If a company within one of the system categories\n\ndoes decide to vertically integrate in a downward fashion, they will\n\naccomplish it through the acquisition route, a joint venture, or some\n\nlong-term contract with a photovoltaic product supplier.\n\nIt is unlikely that these companies will attempt to develop\n\nthe photovoltaic venture internal to their own organization. If\n\ntheir captive needs are sufficiently large, the easiest, quickest,\n\nand most efficient route for them would be to join forces with an\n\nexisting photovoltaic supplier through some means.\n\nThe majority of their internal development work has and will\n\ncontinue to be devoted toward developments of systems rather than\n\nthe individual components within that system. There are certainly\n\nexceptions to this general statement, as would be exemplified by the\n\nelectric utility equipment supply firms.\n\nMARKETING EXPERTISE STRONGEST ASSET\nIn relationship to the\n\nmarketing aspects of the photovoltaic venture, these companies are\n\nalready well established in this area, either through captive needs\n\nfor photovoltaics or in their long-term relationship with the major\n\nend-users of systems. These firms have close ties with the ultimate\n\nbulk energy markets of the future, which include areas such as:\n\n* Communications\n\n* Agriculture\n\n\n122\n\nGnostc Concepts Inc.\n\ne The electric utility industry\n\n* The powering of commercial, institutional, and industrial\n\nfacilities\n\n* The support of infrastructure developments in the lesser\xc2\xad\ndeveloped countries\n\nThus the addition of the photovoltaic aspect to their business would\n\nnot require a heavy investment in the marketing area, especially if\n\ncaptive needs or the serviced market requirements are significant.\n\nThe ability of these companies to distribute hardware and\n\nservices throughout the world is already well established. The\n\naddition of supplying and distributing photovoltaic hardware and the\n\nservicing of that hardware would not be a serious restriction.\n\nGOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO HAVE LIMITED INFLUENCE \n\ndifficult for government actions or programs to\ncompanies to invest in the photovoltaic venture\nof industrialization. The photovoltaic content\nis relatively small and would require a sizable\nto the possible benefits.\n\n\nIt will be\n\ninduce these\n\nat the early stage\n\nof their end products\n\ninvestment compared\n\n\nGOVERNMENT ROLE IN ENCOURAGING INVESTMENT\n\nPARTNERSHIP NEEDED BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY \n\nIt has\n\nbeen implied by the above discussions that there does not appear to\n\nbe any particular industry grouping today that meets all of the\n\nrequirements for the viable long-term photovoltaic-oriented company.\n\nEach company or industry type has assets and deficits. Survivability\n\nin the photovoltaic venture will depend upon several parameters and\n\nnot just one or two selected ones. No company can expect long-term\n\npotentials to be accomplished if they do not bring to bear the\n\nnecessary resources in all of the mentioned areas.\n\nThe photovoltaic venture is not a simple one, and yet it is\n\nnot beyond the resources of American industry. It should also be\n\nrecognized that it is not beyond the resources of foreign countries\n\nand their industries. In most cases, foreign governments have formed\n\npartnerships with their industries in many areas of endeavor, and it\n\nis not beyond expectation that the photovoltaic industry will be\n\nsupported on a partnership basis by these foreign governments. Thus\n\nthere is the added pressure that the US government and its agencies\n\nshould endeavor to establish a positive nonrestrictive working\n\nrelationship to accelerate the industrialization of the photovoltaic\n\nventure.\n\n\n9Gnostic Concepts. Inc.\n\n123\n\nOBJECTIVE SHOULD BE TO FOSTER POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe methods by which the industrialization will take place within\n\nvarious companies is through internal development, acquisitions,\n\njoint ventures, long-term contracts, and other innovative "marriages"\n\nbetween companies. The objective of the government actions and\n\npolicies should be to foster an environment in which these routes of\n\nendeavor can be more easily pursued and encourage the joining\n\ntogether of assets of various companies to meet the overall\n\nrequirements of the photovoltaic venture.\n\nThe independent development of the necessary assets by each\n\ncompany will prolong the industrialization period. If, however, an\n\nenvironment is so created by government policy that the assets from\n\neach of several companies can be brought together within the confines\n\nof a series of photovoltaic-oriented companies, then the time frame\n\nrequired for the industrialization period will be significantly\n\nreduced. A likely result of this will be the rapid development of\n\nonly a small number of highly efficient but extremely large\n\nphotovoltaic-oriented companies.\n\nDuring the foreseeable future, the trend is for the emergence\n\nof a number of independent photovoltaic companies, most of which will\n\nnot have the financial staying power referred to in earlier sections.\n\nTheir development will be needed to act as seed companies that can\n\nlater be acquired by those firms having both the marketing and\n\nfinancial expertise required for the long-term survivability.\n\nThrough this route, the industrialization program and the desired\n\nproduction of photovoltaic products to meet the national energy\n\nrequirements are compatible with the requirements of industry to meet\n\nfinancial reward requirements on the part of the stockholders. It\n\nalso allows for small businesses to develop even though they will\n\nultimately be absorbed.\n\nThe ultimate timing of meeting those requirements, however,\n\nmay not be compatible with national photovoltaic goals and objec\xc2\xad\ntives. It can certainly be stated that government policies and\n\nactions could very easily delay the ultimate industrialization of\n\nthe photovoltaic program. Careful consideration of all programs and\n\npolicies will have to be pursued such that the detrimental effects\n\ndo not override the intended positive influence.\n\n\n124\n\n2Cnostc Concepts Inc\n\n3.7\n\nP ER CE IV E D\n\nIN V E ST M E N T\n\nB A R R I E R S\n\n\nOVERV IEW\n\nThe insights to the motivations to invest, the elements of\n\nthe investment proposal process and the final decision environment,\n\nand company characteristics lead to the identification of investment\n\nbarriers. There are no two companies in the US industrial complex\n\nthat are uniquely alike. They each have their own special charac\xc2\xad\nteristics, history, tradition, and personality. Thus what may appear\n\nto be a barrier to one company may not be considered a serious\n\nbarrier to another company. Generalizations can, however, be made\n\nalong with some observations concerning the perception and types of\n\nbarriers that are encountered.\n\nPERCEPTION OF BARRIERS CAN CHANGE\nIt is important to realize\n\nthat barriers to the entrance into a given investment opportunity\n\nare subject to judgment. Barriers are perceived and subject to\n\ninterpretation. Predicting how one specific company will react to a\n\ngiven policy designed to reduce the height of an investment barrier\n\nis extremely difficult if not completely impossible.\n\nThe judgment aspect associated with a perceived barrier can\n\nchange strictly with a change in personnel at the critical positions\n\nwithin a corporation, even though the financial, market, and physical\n\ncharacteristics of the opportunity did not change at all. Thus what\n\ncould appear to be an excellent investment opportunity as fostered\n\nby a government action or policy may at a later date result in an\n\nalmost opposite interpretation.\n\nA high-technology-oriented company directed by a one-man final\n\nauthority having a technical background may view the photovoltaic\n\nventure as an excellent opportunity. However, change that final\n\nauthority to a financially-oriented individual, and that same corpo\xc2\xad\nration may have an entirely different interpretation of that same\n\nphotovoltaic investment opportunity.\n\nTWO TYPES OF BARRIERS\nIt is difficult for a company to\n\nreverse its decision once an investment has already been made,\n\nespecially if it is an extremely larqe investment. It can occur,\n\nhowever, and it will usually follow the route of selling a division\n\nor a given investment program to some other corporation, especially\n\nif it has reached the point at which the investment can be identified\n\nand segregated from other corporate activities.\n\n\n= Gnostc Concepts, Inc.\n\n125\n\nTo avoid the reversal of a major decision and possible\n\nsignificant financial losses, companies will often spend large sums\n\nof time and money to ensure the proper decision is being made. The\n\ndegree and specific nature of the investment is not generally the\n\nprincipal concern. The issue will center around whether the proposed\n\ninvestment area is something the corporation wishes to pursue.\n\nCompanies that are not completely sure of their ultimate\n\nparticipation in a given investment area may pursue it in the series\n\nroute or series parallel route, as described in the early sections\n\nof this chapter. In this fashion, they can hold down their invest\xc2\xad\nment until they have resolved other barriers that may be restricting\n\nthem from a more aggressive pursuit of the investment opportunity.\n\nThus barriers can take the form of either absolute barriers\n\nthat completely keep a company from making an investment, or they\n\ncan be secondary barriers that influence the manner in which they\n\nmake the investment. These secondary barriers may also be of suffi\xc2\xad\ncient size to restrict the company from making any investment what\xc2\xad\nsoever in the photovoltaic venture. The absolute barriers can be\n\nthought of as being more definitive in their results in that they\n\neither allow an investment consideration to proceed forward, or it\n\nrejects it entirely. The secondary barriers tend to be more a matter\n\nof degree and center around the form of the investment.\n\n\nABSOLUTE\n\nBARRIERS\n\n\nLOW FINANCIAL REWARD\n\nA low financial reward can be perceived as a result of two\n\nbasic items. First, the return in the proposed venture area may be\n\nsmaller than other opportunities that are made available at the same\n\ntime to a given corporation. The second factor is that if present\n\ninvestments are yielding considerably higher returns than the\n\nproposed venture, then the venture may be delayed or rejected in\n\nhopes that better opportunities will occur in some other area. The\n\nmix of present investments can thus set the minimum standards for\n\nany future investments.\n\nIn virtually every corporation of any substantial size, there\n\nare always several investment opportunities provided throughout the\n\nfiscal year. The photovoltaic venture, for example, will always be\n\nin competition for the attraction of investment dollars and\n\nresources, no matter when it is considered. In the larger corpora\xc2\xad\ntions, it may find competition from several hundred opportunities,\n\nwhile in the smaller corporations the number of competing opportuni\xc2\xad\nties will be somewhat limited, perhaps less than a dozen. Thus there\n\nis ample opportunity to compare the photovoltaic investment against\n\nmany other opportunities.\n\n\n126\n\nQ\n\nGnosdc Concepts. Inc\n\nDistinction should be made between financial risks and a\n\nperceived low financial reward as a barrier to investment. A finan\xc2\xad\ncial reward is based upon those quantitative parameters that can be\n\ncalculated and evaluated on a sensitivity basis. A given financial\n\nreward for an investment may be accepted, but that does not guarantee\n\nthat the calculated reward will be obtained. Even a perceived high\n\nfinancial reward has financial risks associated with it in that many\n\nfactors may develop in the future that could jeopardize the attain\xc2\xad\nment of that reward. Regardless of the value of the reward\n\nperceived, there are always associated risks.\n\nAny government policies or actions that are developed will\n\nneed to reduce the investment base on which the financial reward is\n\nconsidered or increase early revenues for the same investment level.\n\nThis would, in effect, cause the financial reward to appear larger.\n\nAny actions that may influence the early acceleration of market\n\ndevelopment would have the effect of increasing early revenues for\n\nthe same investment and also act as a reduction to the low financial\n\nreward barrier. A reduction in risk through government actions will\n\nalso enhance investments that might otherwise be limited or delayed.\n\n\nMARKETS OR PRODUCTS NOT COMPATIBLE\n\nThe second absolute barrier is that markets or products are\n\nnot compatible with corporate objectives. In effect, it states that\n\nthe relationships of the photovoltaic products, markets, or customers\n\nare too diverse from the present and future desired business\n\ncomplexion to deserve any significant consideration at the present\n\ntime. This does not mean that there will not be any monies at all\n\ndevoted to the photovoltaic venture. It simply means that the degree\n\nor level of investment will have to remain as a budgetary item within\n\nsome business unit or research and development activity.\n\nIt still leaves open the possibility for the attraction of\n\ncontinued government projects or contracts, especially in the tech\xc2\xad\nnology or materials development area. What it specifically means is\n\nthat no separate organization, manpower, resources, or financial\n\nsupport will be devoted to the photovoltaic venture other than to\n\nkeep the company abreast of the developments within the industry.\n\nThis would be very typical of many of the materials and semiconductor\n\ncompanies in viewing the photovoltaic investment venture.\n\nStill other companies may consider the photovoltaic venture\n\nso diverse that not even minor budgetary monies should be spent on\n\nthe subject area. This could very easily be the viewpoint of most\n\ncompanies outside the materials and semiconductor industries. It\n\nwill be extremely difficult for any govdrnment action or policy to\n\nbe developed that will overcome this absolute barrier.\n\n\nF=Gnostc Concepts. Inc.\n\n127\n\nSECONDARY\n\nBARR I ERS\n\n\nHIGH-RISK--TECHNOLOGY\n\nOne of the most common barriers to a company making an\n\ninvestment in the photovoltaic venture is the possibility of havihg\n\na present-day technology obsoleted in a relatively short time frame.\n\nThis is especially true if significant dollars are required for\n\nautomation to reduce product cost. A significant technological\n\nbreakthrough in either packaging or solar cell device concepts could\n\nobsolete the automated equipment.\n\nEven if automation is not involved, there are other signifi\xc2\xad\ncant financial investments to be made in equipment if high production\n\nquantities are to be delivered. To support a high-volume production\n\nline in the near term or early portion of the intermediate market,\n\nlarge quantities of equipment must be put in place. The threat of a\n\ntechnological breakthrough requiring entirely different equipment\n\ncould foster a fear in the minds of the responsible individuals of a\n\ncorporation to delay making the investment in the photovoltaic\n\nventure.\n\nThe long-term perspective for photovoltaics is that technology\n\nbreakthroughs must occur if significant strides in cost reduction\n\nare to be obtained. With this in mind, many corporations will be\n\nreluctant to make the necessary financial investments in this oppor\xc2\xad\ntunity. There will be a tendency to wait until the technology is\n\ndeveloped. Only those companies with sufficient financial staying\n\npower will be able to justify the investments in the near- or\n\nintermediate-term time frame. In most cases, a company investing in\n\nthe photovoltaic venture will do so with the long-term perspective\n\nthat technological breakthroughs will occur and that equipnent\n\nimplemented during the early phase of the photovoltaic venture will\n\nultimately be obsoleted.\n\nThe design of government actions must be in such a manner as\n\nnot to bias the industry toward certain companies, nor to eliminate\n\nthe pursuit of future viable technologies. Any action on the part\n\nof the government to advance the technology will heighten the risk\n\nof technology obsolescence. If, however, technology advances are\n\nnot supported by government actions, then step functions in cost\n\nreductions may not occur soon enough to meet national goals.\n\n\n128\n\nGnosti Concept Inc\n\nHIGH-RISK--MARKETS\n\nThe principal concern associated with this barrier is the\n\ntimely development of sufficiently large markets to support the\n\nphotovoltaic venture and to provide adequate return on the invest\xc2\xad\nment, at least over a long period of time. The proper and accurate\n\nidentification of markets is key in the evaluation of the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture. Special characteristics of markets must also be\n\ntaken into consideration. The rate at which the technology and new\n\nproducts can be transferred to the market, the methods of doing\n\nbusiness, and several qualitative issues may heavily influence the\n\nperception of the risks.\n\nMany markets for photovoltaic applications have been identi\xc2\xad\nfied. However, what is often missing is the identification of the\n\nbasic driving forces that guide the development and growth of the\n\nmarket. These are needed to assist the prospective company in\n\nunderstanding how a sufficient penetration of photovoltaics is\n\npossible. The improper or inadequate identification of markets by\n\nthe government may discourage prospective companies from entering\n\nthe photovoltaic venture. A series of insufficient market forecasts\n\ncould cast serious doubt upon the entire photovoltaic venture, even\n\nthough excellent markets may exist in the long run.\n\nAnother limiting aspect in prospective photovoltaic market\n\ndevelopments is the presence of other competing technologies that\n\nmay limit or completely restrict the penetration of photovoltaic\n\nproducts. The market analysis must include a thorough analysis of\n\nthe economics and the qualitative issues associated with these other\n\ntechnologies that are presently servicing that market or would come\n\nto bear under different market conditions. The company investing in\n\nthe photovoltaic venture must be knowledgeable and aware of all of\n\nthe contingencies such that they can make the necessary plans,\n\nstrategies, and product definitions to effectively compete against\n\nthese technologies.\n\nThere is also the fear that a market may disappear. This is\n\nespecially true in relationship to government markets or markets that\n\nare heavily influenced by government regulations. There are fears,\n\ndoubts, and uncertainties associated with what the long-term position\n\nof the US government will be concerning photovoltaic markets and\n\ntheir development. What role the government will play in the devel\xc2\xad\nopment is not always clear. A lack of a clear long-term government\n\npolicy may seriously restrict the investment process.\n\nTo combat market risk, government actions should be directed\n\nat stimulating market growth at the user level. In addition, the\n\nactions should attempt to properly identify information aDout a given\n\nfuture market so that a prospective company can base their investment\n\ndecision on as much quantitative information as is possible. The\n\ndevelopment of solid long-term commercial markets can be more\n\n\nF\n\nGnstc Concepts, Inc\n\n129\n\neffective than the development of short-term artificial government\n\nmarkets. The market risks associated with proper market identifica\xc2\xad\ntion can only be reduced by market studies, field interviews, and\n\nfirsthand knowledge concerning the market.\n\n\nATTITUDE TOWARD GOVERNMENT PRESENCE\n\nThe presence of the government in the development of markets,\n\nthe support of technology, the dissemination of information, and the\n\nother areas of the industrialization process can be viewed by\n\nprospective investors in both a positive and negative fashion. There\n\nare firms that refuse to participate in any markets that are heavily\n\ninfluenced, controlled, or regulated by government agencies. Their\n\nbasic fear is they will lose control of their own destiny. It is\n\nthe fear of losing their flexibility to react to competition and\n\nchanging market conditions that will restrict their investment in\n\nthe photovoltaic venture.\n\nAdditionally, there is the fear of losing proprietary infor\xc2\xad\nmation. The acceptance of a government contract very often is asso\xc2\xad\nciated with the relinquishing of control of any information, data,\n\nor equipment that may be developed. To some companies, this is not\n\nworth the momentary profits that could be made from the project and\n\nthe significance of the good will associated with making such\n\ntechnological breakthroughs is not considered sufficiently important.\n\nThe perspective that a company places upon the loss of\n\nproprietary rights depends upon whether they feel technology or\n\nmarketing expertise will best maintain a leadership role for them in\n\nthe photovoltaic venture. If technology is considered the foundation\n\nfor their leadership position, then they will be reluctant to enter\n\ninto dealings with the government that may ultimately result in a\n\nloss of their proprietary technology information. Conversely, if a\n\ncompany feels that it is the product design and marketing of that\n\nproduct that is going to be ultimately important, then the loss of\n\nproprietary technology information may not be considered a\n\nrestriction.\n\nThe long-term position of the government within the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture can have a significant influece upon a company. The\n\nfear is that a company will invest in the photovoltaic venture based\n\nupon certain government regulations, purchases, and environmental\n\ncontrol conditions and then suddenly find that the government has\n\neither substantially changed its position, or has entirely withdrawn\n\nfrom support of the photovoltaic industry. This could bring finan\xc2\xad\ncial disaster to the investing company. It is felt in many cases\n\nthat it is too early in the industrialization process to know the\n\ntrue long-term position of the government in this area. Conse\xc2\xad\nquently, investments are being withheld until confidence can be\n\ngained in what the government position will ultimately become.\n\n\n130\n\nEl Gnostic Concepts. Inc.\n\nIndustry prefers to work with known entities. The selection\n\nof even an inadequate or bad policy position in photovoltaics can be\n\ndealt with by industry. An unknown government position, however,\n\ncannot be dealt with on a constructive basis. Thus a poor government\n\nposition can be worse than an unknown government position in the\n\nviewpoint of industry. It is important, then, for the government\n\nposition and regulations to be solidified asearly as possible.\n\nThe presence of the government in the photovoltaic venture\n\ncan act as an extremely positive influence upon investments. This\n\nis especially true for companies that have over the years had a good\n\nrealtionship with the government. Companies that have dealt in a\n\npositive fashion in several areas with the government will be more\n\nlikely to invest in an area of potential high government involvement.\n\nConversely, negative past experience with the government can act as\n\na restrictive force in inducing potential investors into the\n\nphotovoltaic venture.\n\n\nCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe evaluation of a competitor\'s strengths and weaknesses can\n\nalso influence the investment decision. If the competition is viewed\n\nto have a strong technological base or market position, then a\n\npotential investing company must find some method by which they can\n\ncounteract these forces if the investment is to move forward.\n\nHowever, if the competition is viewed to be weak in most areas, then\n\na potential company may decide to move rapidly into the photovoltaic\n\nventure.\n\nAt this point, there are several formidable competitors, but\n\nno one has a complete lock upon the market. The market is still in\n\nan unstable condition with the leadership role shifting each year\n\nfrom one company to another. The share of market for each company\n\nis also changing. As long as an unstable market condition exists,\n\nthere will always be opportunities for new companies in the\n\nphotovoltaic venture.\n\nThe investment for a new company in photovoltaics will take\n\nseveral different forms, depending on where their competitors\'\n\nstrengths lie. There will be a tendency not to invade a competitor\'s\n\nmajor area of strength. Consequently, new companies being formed\n\nwill base their investment upon selected market areas in which to\n\nbecome dominant participators. Future investors will have fewer\n\ndegrees of freedom in selecting those markets to be serviced, as they\n\nwill have to account for those companies that are already in the\n\nphotovoltaic venture.\n\n\nE\n\nGrostc Concepts Inc\n\n131\n\nNew companies entering will have to consider what their unique\n\nstrength is over their competitors, especially if direct head-to-head\n\ncompetition in a given marketplace is contemplated. Even if future\n\ncompanies enter the photovoltaic venture in areas in which there is\n\nlittle or no competition, they will still have to consider what\n\nresources they must bring together to remain a dominant or effective\n\ncompetitor in those selected market areas. They cannot expect to\n\ncontinue to exist in a given market area without attracting\n\nother competitors, especially if the growth opportunities are\n\nsignificant.\n\nIn general terms, it will be difficult to implement any\n\ngovernment action that will not disturb the competitive environment\n\nin most marketplaces in some fashion. Policies and actions should\n\ntherefore be developed to indicate market conditions and requirements\n\nfor effective penetration, but they must be careful not to divulge\n\ncompetitor strengths, weaknesses, capabilities, client relationships,\n\nand other proprietary company information. Most government actions\n\nwill have a tendency to reduce the competitive gap between the\n\nstronger and weaker companies.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONAL ISSUES\n\nThere are many noneconomic issues that could restrict the\n\ndevelopment of certain market segments. Examples of such issues\n\nwould be:\n\ns\ne\n*\ns\nI\na\n*\n@\n\nPlanning cycles within given market areas\n\nGovernment regulations\n\nTransfer of technology\n\nTradition\n\nLocal government restrictions\n\nEnvironmental restrictions\n\nBuilding codes\n\nInsurance coverage\n\n\nAs discussed in the investment proposal processes and the Final\n\ndecision environment, these can often emerge as the dominant issues\n\nin the decision to invest in the photovoltaic venture. Quantitative\n\ndata showing marginal return on investment can be overriden by the\n\nuncertainties associated with these institutional issues.\n\nLow-cost, efficient, properly deployed photovoltaic products\n\nmay still not penetrate a given market area if the concepts of this\n\nnew technology cannot be envisioned or accepted by the dominant\n\npotential users in the market. Tradition in given marketplaces could\n\nplay an extremely restrictive role in the development and penetration\n\nof photovoltaics. In those areas, it will require more than\n\ncost-effectiveness to penetrate the market.\n\n\n132\n\nECnostiConcepts, Inc\n\nOther markets may still be restricted in their acceptance of\n\nphotovoltaics due to the extremely long planning cycles required\n\nbefore a new innovation can be implemented. The electric utility\n\nindustry is an excellent example in the domestic market. Certain\n\nplanning cycles, procedures, approvals, and governmental requirements\n\nmust be met before any innovative idea or concept can be implemented.\n\nIf there were a sudden availability of low-cost photovoltaic\n\nproducts, it would still require a five- to ten-year development\n\nperiod before significant penetration of the electric utility\n\nindustry were possible.\n\nRural electrification in developing countries is also charac\xc2\xad\nterized by long planning cycles. Rural electrification will result\n\nonly after it has become recognized as being needed for political\n\nreasons. It will then be incorporated in the long-range development\n\nplan. The penetration of photovoltaics in these applications will\n\nrequire several years of planning and preparation before actual sale\n\nof any significant quantities can be accomplished, even if price and\n\navailability are greatly enhanced over near-term prospects.\n\nThe objective of any government policies and actions to reduce\n\nthis barrier would be to disseminate all of the necessary information\n\nconcerning the institutional or noneconomic issues involved in each\n\nof the given future markets. To obtain such information may not be\n\npossible through strictly market studies. It may require the\n\ninstallation of an experimental photovoltaic power system. Once\n\nthese issues are known and understood, American industry can develop\n\ncompatible programs.\n\n\nBALANCE OF SYSTEM COSTS\n\nA barrier to the investment in the photovoltaic venture is\n\nthe fear that some other system component may ultimately restrict\n\nthe high-growth opportunities. A prime example of this would be the\n\nenergy storage system, primarily in the area of the storage battery.\n\nOther potential areas of high-cost components are in power condi\xc2\xad\ntioning, structural material, installation costs, and interconnect\n\nmaterial. These elements do not present as optimistic a future for\n\ncost reductions as does the photovoltaic module itself. Conse\xc2\xad\nquently, penetration of photovoltaic-powered equipment may find\n\nrestrictions due to these other elements.\n\nThe development of government actions and plans should thus\n\nincorporate aggressive cost reduction programs in the balance of the\n\ncost of the system components. At some point, a significant reduc\xc2\xad\nti-on in the cost of the photovoltaic content of the system may not\n\nresult in any significant reduction in the overall systems cost. It\n\nwill be the photovoltaic system that must compete against other\n\nsystems in the marketplace, not just the photovoltaic portion of the\n\nsystem.\n\n\nE\n\nGnostic Concepts. Inc\n\n133\n\nThere must be a coordination of efforts between these other\n\ncomponent cost reduction programs and those of the photovoltaic\n\nprogram such that the most optimum system cost is developed. There\n\nare, for example, present government programs devoted to the\n\ndevelopment of low-cost batteries. However, they are not being\n\ncoordinated with the photovoltaic program; in fact, the objective is\n\nto develop batteries for load-leveling and electric vehicle\n\nindustries rather than the photovoltaic industry. While there may\n\nbe side benefits to the photovoltaic program, there is no guarantee\n\nthat the technological breakthroughs and products being developed\n\nunder this other government program will be directly applicable to\n\nphotovoltaic applications. The same would apply to power condition\xc2\xad\ning and other component areas that will be supported in the future\n\nby government development programs.\n\n\n134\n\n2Gnosdc Concepts Inc\n\n4.Effect of Governmernment Actions\n\n4.1\n\n0 B J E C T I V E S\n\n\nNEED\nTO\nDEFINE\nGOVERNMENT\n\n\nPROPER\n\nROLE\n\nOF\n\n\nThe national photovoltaic program has as part of its central\n\ntheme the rapid development of not only markets but also the imple\xc2\xad\nmentation of low-cost photovoltaic manufacturing processes. Under\n\nnormal market conditions, it is not uncommon for a newly formed\n\nindustry to require from 15 to 25 years for full and mature develop\xc2\xad\nment. This is true even in the high technology areas where there is\n\na high degree of innovativeness and entrepreneurial activities\n\noccurring.\n\nSEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY SLOW TO DEVELOP\nThe semiconductor\n\nindustry began to serve commercial markets in the mid-1950s. The\n\nintegrated circuit development work in the late 1950s and early 1960s\n\ndid not result in a full blossoming of a large number of companies\n\nuntil the mid- to late 1960s. In addition, the major portion of all\n\nsemiconductor products even by 1970 were consumed by only two major\n\nmarket areas: military applications and the computer industry.\n\nThe economic downturn of the early 1970s caused many semi\xc2\xad\nconductor companies tremendous financial strain. Several companies\n\nceased operations. Others had to relinquish significant portions of\n\ntheir holdings, and others were completely absorbed by larger corpo\xc2\xad\nrations. Only during the 1970s has the base for the semiconductor\n\nindustry been expanding into many different market areas, including\n\nconsumer electronics, industrial controls, office equipment, instru\xc2\xad\nmentation, communications, automotive products, and a host of other\n\nbasic markets. Itthus took from the mid-1950s to the early to\n\nmid-1970s to have semiconductor products consumed in a wide variety\n\nof markets.\n\n\n2Gnosac Concepts Inc\n\n135\n\nOBJECTIVE IS TO ACCELERATE INDUSTRIALIZATION\nA principal\n\nobjective of the national photovoltaic program is the rapid acceler\xc2\xad\nation of the industrialization process for the photovoltaic venture.\n\nIt is hoped that through positive government actions, programs, and\n\npolicies the 15- to 25-year development period can be reduced\n\nsignificantly. It is thus important that the proper role of the\n\ngovernment be identified at the earliest stage of development of the\n\n\',photovoltaic venture.\n\n\n136\n\nFGnoscConceps. Inc\n\n4.2 \t INFLUENCE OF\nGOVERNMENT\nINVOLVE-\n\nMENT\nON\nNORMAL\nMARKET\nCONDITIONS\n\n\nUNDERLY ING\nSELECTION\n\n\nCRITERIA\n\nFOR\n\nACTION\n\n\nThe stated government policy is that any selected actions are\n\nto supplement rather than overpower or bypass the basic market forces\n\nin the free enterprise system. Normal market environment conditions\n\nare to prevail as much as possible during the industrialization of\n\nthe photovoltaic venture. The objective is then to enhance these\n\nnormal conditions and foster a more rapid development of the natural\n\nevolution of the photovoltaic venture.\n\nCONDITIONS CONSTANTLY CHANGING\nWith this boundary condition,\n\nthe question arises as to what are the best areas for the government\n\ninvolvement that will least disturb normal market conditions but yet\n\naccelerate the industrialization process. There will be an ever\xc2\xad\nevolving number of opportunities for government actions. Flexibility\n\nand timely offering of incentive packages will be critical. The\n\ngovernment actions must change as the market conditions and the\n\ntechnology developments change. What is needed in the early stages\n\nof the industrialization process may have no effect or may even be\n\ndetrimental in the intermediate to latter stages. They must lead\n\nthese changing conditions, however, if they are to continually assist\n\nin accelerating the industrialization process. This requires the\n\ngovernment policy and program developers to be aware of and in touch\n\nwith various companies, their needs, their involvement with photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaics, and in general provide an atmosphere of trust and\n\npartnership.\n\nCRITERIA BASED ON DESIRE FOR EFFICIENT USE OF DOLLARS AND INDUSTRIAL\n\nEXPERIENCE\nReasons for applying this underlying criteria of\n\nnot wanting to overpower normal market forces include:\n\n* A more efficient use of the taxpayers\' dollars. In effect,\n\nthis is a cost-sharing approach. The government could\n\nfinance the entire operation, establishing government-owned\n\nand -operated facilities and supplying the product at a\n\nsufficiently low price as to cause a high demand for the\n\nproduct. However, the cost to the taxpayer would be\n\ntremendous. Through the involvement of the US industrial\n\ncomplex, many of the expenses that will be required to\n\ndevelop the photovoltaic venture will be supplied by\n\nindustry.\n\n\nF\n\nCnostc concepts Inc\n\n137\n\ne Through the involvement of the American industrial complex,\n\n\nthe creativity and ingenuity of the American free enterprise\n\nsystem will be brought to bear upon the development of the\n\nphotovoltaic venture. This aspect of the American culture\n\nmay not have an opportunity to operate in an efficient\n\nmanner if the entire cost of the project was completely or\n\ntotally controlled by the government agencies.\n\nIt is hoped that through this approach to the industrializa\xc2\xad\ntion function that the benefits of financial and technical resources,\n\nalong with proven and experienced business practices, can best\n\ndevelop the photovoltaic venture.\n\n\nSPECTRUM\nOF\nPO TENTIAL\nINVOLVEMENT\n\n\nAREAS\n\nOF\n\n\nWithin the photovoltaic industry hierarchy, there are a\n\ntremendous number of opportunities for government involvement. The\n\nspectrum of potential areas ranges from the research and development\n\nsubsidies through government-furnished equipment and into market\n\nstimulation and generation, with many intermediate options. The\n\nmajor areas of the photovoltaic industry hierarchy are shown in\n\nFigure 4.1. In addition are shown the principal areas in which\n\ngovernment policies and programs can be applied to stimulate the\n\nindustrialization process.\n\nThe areas in which policies can best be applied would be:\n\n* Market stimulation\n\n@ Product development\n\n* Technology advancement\n\nAreas that are best stimulated through various government programs\n\nand financing methods would be:\n\n* System and market analysis\n\na Production facilities\n\na Research and development\n\nBoth policies and programs can act as a stimulation or incentive to\n\nthe development of each layer of the photovoltaic industry hierarchy.\n\nWhether a policy or a financial program is applied to a given area\n\ndepends on the results that are desired.\n\nTo be the most effective, it will require a coordinated effort\n\nbetween the establishment of proper policies and the implementation\n\nof programs. For instance, it may be that in certain applications\n\nwithin major markets, an experimental system must be established\n\nthrough some financial program to determine the major characteristics\n\n\n138\n\nr ;Gnostic Concepts.

The establishment of policies will not\n\nnecessarily require the expenditure of monies directly but it will\n\nin many cases result in a cost to the government in the form of\n\nreduced revenues collected through the tax system. These lost\n\nrevenues can be considered expenditures on the part of the govern\xc2\xad\nment, but they may be difficult or impossible to identify and asso\xc2\xad\nciate specifically with the photovoltaic industrialization program.\n\n\nSGnostic Concepts, Inc\n\n0\n\n139\n\nWhile there are many opportunities within the photovoltaic\n\nindustry hierarchy for government involvement, it is not necessarily\n\nbeneficial to have a government program or policy established for\n\nevery opportunity. Some areas may best be accomplished through the\n\nnormal procedures and methods of doing business that are already\n\nestablished within the US industrial complex. It must be remembered\n\nthat the objective of the government role is to stimulate and enhance\n\nthe industrialization process, not to dominate or overwhelm industry\n\ncapabilities. There are certain areas that may best be left to the\n\ningenuity and creativity of American industrialists.\n\n\n140\n\nE Cnostk Concepts. Inc\n\n4.3\n\nGOVERNMENT\nINCENTIVES\nINVESTMENT\n\n\nCOMMENTARY ON\nINCENTI VES\n\n\nREACTION\n\nTO\n\nTO\n\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\n\nThere are many incentives that the government can use to\n\ninduce industry into investment areas. Each of these incentives can\n\nalso have a large number of variations such that their design can\n\nmeet the special needs of each participating company. Extreme care\n\nmust be taken, however, in their design in that they can easily bias\n\nthe direction in which the market develops and selectively enhance\n\nand discourage specific companies.\n\nDIRECT GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES AT FUNDAMENTAL BARRIERS\nIn any\n\nventure, it is easy to identify those companies-that would appear to\n\nbe the most logical to participate in that venture, and it is also\n\neasy to design policies and programs around those companies. Through\n\nsuch policy designs, these companies become heavily involved in the\n\nventure. It appears as though the policies were properly designed\n\nand attracted the proper companies. However, if the incentive\n\npackage had been designed to reduce barriers to investments, then it\n\nmay have been found that a broader spectrum of companies could have\n\nbecome involved in the venture.\n\nIt is thus critical and important that the government incen\xc2\xad\ntives be developed. In relationship to the photovoltaic venture,\n\nthe most obvious companies to be involved would be the semiconductor\xc2\xad\nbased companies. The technology for the photovoltaic venture is\n\nbased upon the same technology and manufacturing techniques that have\n\nmade the semiconductor venture so successful in this country. But\n\nas discussed in earlier sections, the semiconductor industry has\n\nassociated with it many deficits that will have to be overcome \n\nin\n\nsome fashion to meet all of the requirements of the future\n\nphotovoltaic industry.\n\nThere are other industry-type companies that have far greater\n\nassets available to be devoted to the photovoltaic venture than do\n\nthe semiconductor companies. Even within those companies, there \n\nare\n\nsome serious deficits which must be overcome. In order for the\n\ngovernment not to bias the market toward the semiconductor industry\n\nor retard or eliminate some valuable resources in other companies,\n\nthe government incentive packages must be carefully designed and\n\ndirected at fundamental barriers to investments across the entire US\n\nindustrial complex. They should not be directed at the removal of\n\nspecific barriers associated with specific companies.\n\n\nE3Cnosttc Concepts. Inc\n\n141\n\nCOMPROMISING OF RESTRICTIONS REQUIRED\nPreparing incentives\n\nnot to bias the market and at the same time meet other boundary\n\nconditions, such as fostering small business or not overpowering\n\nnormal market driving forces and competitive influences, will be\n\nvirtually impossible. A compromise of all of these aspects is the\n\nbest that can be accomplished.\n\nMIXED REACTIONS WILL OCCUR TO ANY GOVERNMENT INCENTIVE\n\nAn incentive designed at reducing investment barriers will be\n\nreceived differently by different companies, even within a similar\n\nindustrial grouping. Each company has its own particular require\xc2\xad\nments and viewpoints of the height of the barriers to the investment.\n\nTwo companies within the same industrial grouping with the same\n\nbarriers will react differently to the same incentive package because\n\nthe barriers to investment will be perceived differently. The\n\ndifference in perspective of each of the investment barriers will\n\nvary due to differences in management style and philosophy, the\n\navailable resources, their relationship to the government, previous\n\ninvestments, and investments that are competing for the resources of\n\nthe company.\n\nBecause of the rate of return on present investments and\n\navailability of cash and credit, the cost of money will vary from\n\none company to another. A high capital-intensive investment such as\n\nphotovoltaics could be seriously influenced by the cost of money.\n\nThis alone may make the photovoltaic venture appear attractive to\n\none company and not attractive to another, even within the same\n\nindustrial grouping.\n\nTo meet the wide variability that exists within the American\n\nindustrial complex, a group of incentives will have to be developed.\n\nNo one or two incentive packages will accomplish the goals of the\n\nindustrialization project. Not only will several parallel incentives\n\nhave to be implemented, but there will also have to be a sequential\n\napplication of incentives to account for the ever-changing conditions\n\nthat will face prospective and present investors.\n\nNEGATIVE ACTIONS SHOULD BE AVOIDED\nThere are also negative\n\ngovernment actions that can bias the market away from certain types\n\nof companies and toward others. This could discourage investments\n\nfrom some of the better-equipped companies. Such a negative action\n\nwould be that of imposing restrictions on the participation of\n\npetrochemical-based firms within the photovoltaic venture, or not\n\nrecognizing other nonsemiconductor-based companies would be seriously\n\ninterested in the photovoltaic venture. Such companies would be\n\nthose associated with thin-film technologies, equipment manufac\xc2\xad\nturers, controls companies, glass and lead producers, and a host of\n\nother industrial firms.\n\n\n142\n\nF\n\nGnostic Concept%Inc\n\nOther negative actions that must be guarded against are the\n\nimplementation of legislation that dictates performance versus cost\n\ncriteria. This is an area that should be left to the ingenuity and\n\nresponsibility of private industry. Legislation must be implemented,\n\nhowever, to protect the public, but it should pot dictate product\n\ndesign or performance criteria. It should, however, deternine\n\nstandards of how performance can be measured and should include\n\ncertain minimum aspects, such as building code requirements and\n\nsafety aspects. Once the pursuit of performance versus cost criteria\n\nis evident, then industrial concerns will begin to lose interest in\n\nthe venture, as they will feel they have lost control of their own\n\ndestiny.\n\nLONG-TERM GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT NEEDED\nSince the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture is a long-range venture, then it would be detrimental\n\nto the acceleration of the industrialization process for the govern\xc2\xad\nment to pursue programs and policies based on only one-year commit\xc2\xad\nments. Multiple-year commitments must be established in all\n\nincentive packages. Government commitments on a one-year basis do\n\nnot allow for the gaining of confidence on the part of industrial\n\ncompanies that the government will be supportive of the photovoltaic\n\nventure in the following years. There must be longer-term commit\xc2\xad\nments on the part of the government if long-term commitments are\n\nexpected from industry, especially if the government\'s objective is\n\nto cause investments to occur sooner than they would normally. Thus,\n\nan excellent incentive package based on too short a time span will\n\nbe far less effective.\n\n\nAVAILABLE\n\nINCENTIVES\n\n\nSUBSIDIZE PHOTOVOLTAIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe subsidizing of research and development activities would\n\ncover a significant portion of expenses of industrial firms associ\xc2\xad\nated with the labor, material, and equipment involved in the devel\xc2\xad\nopment of various phases of the photovoltaic technology. These\n\ninvestigations and development areas would include:\n\ne Solar cell material development such as silicon, gallium\n\narsenide, cadmium sulfide, and other basic materials\n\n* Encapsulation material investigations. This would include\n\nsubstrates, superstrates, fillers, sealants, and other\n\nneeded packaging materials.\n\n\n7 Gnostc Concepts. Inc\n\n143\n\n* Solar cell device technology. This would include tech\xc2\xad\nnologies and manufacturing techniques associated with the\n\nproduction of the actual solar cell device such as\n\ndiffusion, metallization, interconnect, ion implant,\n\nlow-cost silicon sheets, and a wide variety of device\n\nstructure investigations.\n\n* Module assembly. This area would include the automation\n\ntechnologies and investigations of low-cost assembly tech\xc2\xad\nniques required to bring the encapsulation material and\n\nsolar cell devices to a completed functional module.\n\nThe concept of subsidizing photovoltaic research and develop\xc2\xad\nment activities could also be expanded to include the activities\n\nassociated with the functional systems. An additional expansion of\n\nthe concept could also include the remaining components within a\n\nphotovoltaic power supply, such as batteries, construction, and\n\ninterconnect materials. For the purposes of this report, these\n\nextensions of the concept have not been considered. Subsidizing\n\nphotovoltaic research and development has been limited to those items\n\nassociated with the photovoltaic module itself.\n\n\nSUBSIDIZE PRICES\n\nIncentives designed to subsidize prices would be in the form\n\nof payments to photovoltaic suppliers from federal funds to account\n\nfor the difference between the supplier\'s selling price and the price\n\nthat the market is willing to pay. The prevailing market price would\n\nprobably be established as that which exists for presently estab\xc2\xad\nlished energy sources. The supplier\'s price would have to be based\n\nupon industry average selling prices or some arbitrarily selected\n\nprice by the federal government. Another form would be a fixed\n\namount of money per peak .watt shipped paid to the supplier from\n\ngovernment funds. The dollars per peak watt would be on a declining\n\nbasis in association with either accumulated volume or time, regard\xc2\xad\nless of what markets were being served. Subsidized prices would be\n\napplied early in the photovoltaic venture.\n\n\nGUARANTEE MARKET\n\nA guaranteed market incentive would be based on the government\n\ncontinuing to purchase increasing volumes of photovoltaic products\n\neach year but at declining prices. This would continue until it was\n\ndetermined that manufacturing costs were sufficiently low to supply\n\nproducts in the commercial marketplace at competitive prices.\n\nDepending upon the volume required, the government-purchased products\n\nwould first be directed at governnment applications and secondly to\n\ncommercial applications.\n\n\n144\n\n2Gnostic Concepts Inc\n\nEXPERIMENTAL AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS\n\nThe experimental and demonstration projects would be directed\n\nat noncommercially served future photovoltaic markets. The intent\n\nwould be the establishment of a working field experimental model of\n\na photovoltaic-powered functional system. These experiments may not\n\nnecessarily be economically feasible within that market, but they\n\nwould be designed to highlight system problems and institutional\n\nissues. Field demonstration projects would be directed at demon\xc2\xad\nstrating technical and economic viability. There would obviously be\n\nmany experimental projects within a given market before demonstration\n\nprojects were implemented. The emphasis would be upon the system\n\nfirst and the economics second.\n\n\nMARKET STUDIES\n\nMarket studies would be directed at the proper identification\n\nof markets and their characterization. This would include not only\n\nthe applications but the economics involved in the competing energy\n\nsources, the basic driving forces behind that particular application,\n\ninstitutional problems associated with penetration, and product\n\nrequirements.\n\n\nGOVERNMENT-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT\n\nThe government-furnished equipment (GFE) approach is well\n\nestablished within the military and aerospace industries. It could\n\ninclude in its simplest form the grant of funds to a company for an\n\nexperimental piece of equipment. The construction of a building, a\n\ncomplete production facility, and equipment would represent the more\n\nelaborate form of GFE. These facilities and equipment would be under\n\nthe direction of specific companies for manning and operation. The\n\ncompanies would use these resources strictly for the photovoltaic\n\nventure. However, the companies would pay all expenses involved for\n\nlabor, consumables, management, and alterations.\n\n\nMANAGEMENT FEE\n\nA management fee is an addition to the GFE approach. Here\n\nthe expense associated with the operation of a facility, usually the\n\noverhead portion, is paid to a company through a management fee.\n\nManagement fees are seldom if ever used independent of a GFE\n\nfacility. For the purposes of this report, it will be assumed that\n\na management fee is associated with a GFE project.\n\n\nS Cnstk Cont\'pts In\n\n145\n\nPRODUCTION DEMONSTRATION\n\nA production demonstration program provides a small-scale or\n\npilot production facility, implemented with government funding to\n\ndemonstrate not only the technology involved, but the financial\n\nviability of the project. The pilot line itself may not be\n\ncompletely economical, but it will produce the necessary data and\n\ninformation to demonstrate the economic viability at certain minimum\n\nor integral steps. These production facilities are assumed to be\n\nunder the management of some industrial concern. In effect, they\n\nare privately operated rather than government-operated.\n\n\nEND-USER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\n\nIncentives directed at the end-user to assist in justifying\n\nor rationalizing the purchase of photovoltaic products could include\n\ndirect cash rebates on a per-watt basis of installed capacity or may\n\noccur in the form of tax credits. Tax credits assume some tax\n\nliability. For certain companies, this would be a significant\n\nincentive. For the residential homeowner, a tax credit could be a\n\nsignificant influence, as would a direct rebate on a per-watt basis.\n\nThis incentive would be applied only in areas where the difference\n\nin selling price and that which the market is willing to pay is\n\nrelatively small (no more than a factor of 2). This would imply\n\napplication late in the development of the venture.\n\n\nSUPPLIER TAX PREFERENCE\n\nA supplier tax preference incentive assumes the supplier will\n\nhave some tax liability to which he can apply a tax credit. For a\n\nnewly formed photovoltaic company, it may be several years before\n\nsuch tax credits could be used to their advantage. However, large\n\ncorporations with multiple areas of investments in which profits are\n\nbeing realized could use a tax incentive immediately upon the\n\ninvestment in photovoltaics. An additional supplier tax preference\n\ncould be based upon a more rapid acceleration of depreciation for\n\ninvestments made in the photovoltaic area. This would give greater\n\nincentives to newly formed companies as well as the larger,\n\nbroader-based corporations.\n\n\nLOAN GUARANTEES TO PHOTOVOLTAIC INVESTORS\n\nA loan guarantee package would provide assurances to financial\n\nresources that repayment of monies invested in photovoltaics would\n\nbe guaranteed by the government. Their benefits would be directed\n\ntoward those companies that would have difficulty obtaining funds if\n\n\n146\n\nE\n\nCnost7c Concepts Inc\n\nit were so decided to enter the photovoltaic industry. If financial\n\nfunds are available to a prospective company, then loan guarantees\n\nwould have little relevance.\n\nLoan guarantees could be directed at end-users to finance the\n\ninstallation of photovoltaic products. Again, if availability of\n\nfunds were sufficient, then loan guarantees would have no relevance.\n\nIf, however, obtaining funds would be a significant limitation, then\n\nloan guarantees may possibly have some significant influence in the\n\nend-user area.\n\n\nGnostic Concepts Inc\n\n147\n\n4.4 \t E F F E C T O F\nPERCEIVED\n\nMATRIX\n\nOF\n\nGO V E R NM E NT\nBARR I ERS\n\n\nBARRIERS\n\nAND\n\nA\'C T I 0 N\n\nO N\n\n\nINCENTIVES\n\n\nThe perceived barriers to the photovoltaic investment were\n\ndiscussed in Section 3.7. A brief listing of the available\n\nincentives were listed in Section 4.3. A matrix of these perceived\n\nbarriers and the available government incentives is shown in Table\n\n4.1.\n\nIn each cell of the matrix is an indication of the expected\n\neffect of a given government incentive on a perceived barrier. The\n\ndegree of the effect is depicted with the following notation:\n\nI+ \n\nI\n0\nD\nD*\n\nSignificantly increases barrier\n\nIncreases barrier\n\nNo effect\n\nDecreases barrier\n\nSignificantly decreases\n\nLimited duration or under certain specific assumptions\n\nThe notations within the table are from the perspective of a\n\npotential investor in photovoltaics. This is to be distinguished\n\nfrom an investor who has already made the commitment to the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture. Only in a few instances will this distinction make\n\nany significant difference. The descriptions of the various cells\n\nthat \t ollow will denote if this difference is significant.\n\nf\nThe government incentives have been divided into two major\n\nareas: programs and policies. The distinction is that programs are\n\nassociated with fundings that are identifiable and represent direct\n\nsupport of the photovoltaic industry. Policies represent an indirect\n\nsupport of the photovoltaic venture, and it may not be possible to\n\nidentify specifically those dollars involved with supporting the\n\npolicies. Tax credits, for instance, may be difficult to identify\n\ndirectly with the photovoltaic venture, but they do represent\n\ngovernment funding, in that at some future date there will be a\n\nreduction in collected tax revenues.\n\n\n148 \t\n\nE\n\nCnostic Concets nc\n\nTABLE 4.1\n\nIMPACT OF VARIOUS CURRENT GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ON MAJOR PERCEIVED AREAS OF RISK\n\n\nArea of Current\nGovernment Programs\nRepresentative\nGovernment\nProgram\n\nRapid Technological\nAdvamcement\n\nTeChnical/Field\nDemonst rations\nand Experiments\n\nMarket\nCharacterization\nStudies\n\nDirectPurchase\nof Photovoltaic\nProducts\n\nProduction\nDemonstrations\n\nJPL-LSA Project\nTasks I-IV\n\nNASA IS, Sandla,\nL\nMIT, and MERADCOM\nfielddemonstrations\n\nSUNand IT\nmarket studies\n\nJPL.

The point being that if a company\n\nis too diverse from the photovoltaic venture and has no interest in\n\ndiversification into photovoltaics, then there is very little the\n\ngovernment can do.\n\nThere are options available to the government to force a\n\ncompany into the photovoltaic venture. This would, however, be in\n\nviolation of the underlying criteria that the industrialization\n\nprocess disturb as little as possible the normal influences at work\n\nin the marketplace.\n\n\nS2Gnost cConcepts Inc\n\n149\n\n\nEven companies with a significant tie to the photovoltaic\n\nindustry through their technology base may still not decide to\n\ninvest. If the products and markets are considered too diverse from\n\ntheir basic areas of endeavor, it would be difficult to induce even\n\nthose companies into the photovoltaic venture.\n\n\nLOW FINANCIAL REWARD\n\nThe greatest effects on the perceived barrier of low financial\n\nreward come from the subsidizing of photovoltaic research and devel\xc2\xad\nopment efforts and supplier tax preferences. The low financial\n\nreward perceived in the photovoltaic venture can only be overcome by\n\neither reducing the investment on which the rewards are based, or\n\nincreasing the expected revenues.\n\nExpenditures for equipment and other investments in research\n\nand development areas represent a significant portion of the invest\xc2\xad\nment base upon which the reward is measured. Through R&D subsidies\n\nand supplier tax preferences such as accelerated depreciation of\n\nphotovoltaic equipment, the barrier of low perceived financial reward\n\ncan be substantially reduced.. There are other areas and methods also\n\nby which this barrier can be reduced. They include the government\xc2\xad\nfurnished equipment or the management fee incentives. These would\n\nreduce the base upon which rewards are measured.\n\nProduction demonstrations offer the possibility of a reduction\n\nin the perceived low financial reward barrier, in that they may\n\ndemonstrate a production method that has lower costs or investments\n\nthan were originally used in calculating the expected rewards.\n\nConsidering the long development time associated with production\n\ndemonstrations, it is unlikely that a proposed venture would be\n\ninfluenced significantly in the near term by such an incentive.\n\nCompanies considering an investment venture would be well aware of\n\nthe timing of such production demonstrations and would use the latest\n\navailable information in their financial calculations. They would\n\ntherefore not be surprised by any findings from such production\n\ndemonstrations. It could, however, delay a potential company from\n\ninvesting in a photovoltaic venture if they were waiting for the\n\nresults of a production demonstration before investing.\n\nThere are two other areas that may cause a reduction in the\n\nlow financial reward barrier. They would be the field experiments\n\nand demonstration projects, and end-user financial assistance. Here\n\nthe reasoning is that these two areas of incentives could cause an\n\nearlier development of a given market compared to what was expected.\n\nSince future revenues are usually considered on a discounted basis,\n\nthen an earlier arrival of such revenues would have an increased\n\nvalue in the financial calculations.\n\n\n150\n\nM Gnostic Concepts, Inc\n\nIt has been assumed that the subsidizing of prices or the\n\nguaranteeing of markets would be at fair market levels. Under such\n\nassumptions, these two incentives would have little effect upon the\n\ncalculated rewards in a photovoltaic venture. If prices were\n\nguaranteed significantly above their fair market level, or that\n\nsufficiently large markets were being guaranteed, then a possible\n\nsignificant influence could be expected on the perceived rewards.\n\nHowever, such conditions would significantly violate the underlying\n\ncriteria that normal market conditions are to prevail as much as\n\npossible.\n\nLoan guarantees to investing firms were found to have little\n\ninfluencing effect upon the perceived financial rewards. Apparently\n\ncompanies considering the photovoltaic venture have financial\n\nresources available to them, either from internal investments or\n\nfrom credit relationships with financial institutions. Availability\n\nof funds only becomes a problem with small business. However, even\n\nfor a small business venture, a loan guarantee only provides the\n\nfunds; it does not substantially change any of the investments\n\nrequired or the revenues expected. Thus it will have little if any\n\neffect upon the perceived financial rewards available within the\n\nphotovoltaic venture. Having unlimited financial resources available\n\nwill not in most cases induce a company to enter what is perceived\n\nto be a low financial reward venture.\n\n\nMARKET RISKS\n\nThe perceived barriers associated with market risks are\n\ninfluenced the most by market studies and field experiments and\n\ndemonstration projects. The proper identification of markets is best\n\naccomplished through properly designed market studies. None of the\n\nother incentives offer as significant an opportunity for reducing\n\nmarket risks associated with proper market identification as does a\n\nproperly constructed market study. In fact, other incentives provide\n\nno information whatsoever about potential markets. Field experiments\n\nand demonstrations can add insights into market characterizations.\n\nIt will be somewhat limited, however.\n\nIn the area of penetrating identified markets, the most\n\neffective incentive is the end-user financial assistance, which comes\n\nin the form of either tax credits or direct rebates on a per-watt\n\ninstalled basis. Limited insights can possibly be gained from market\n\nstudies and field demonstration projects in how to penetrate markets.\n\nA supplier tax preference can have some influence on penetra\xc2\xad\ntion in that it allows a cost reduction in the product to occur which\n\n-inturn should result in a corresponding increase in penetration\n\nwithin a given market. This assumes, however, that the threshold of\n\n\nE3Gnostc Concepts, Inc.\n\n151\n\neconomic viability has already been reached. If it is significantly\n\nbelow the price of the product, then even a supplier tax preference\n\nmay not allow a sufficient reduction in cost to provide a reduced\n\nprice in the products to enhance further penetration.\n\nThere is a case for subsidizing prices in that it will also\n\nallow the supplier to reduce the price of his product, hopefully\n\nbelow the economic viability threshold. The size of the subsidy,\n\nhowever, may become so large that it would not allow for an efficient\n\nuse of tax dollars. It would only be effective where a marginal\n\ndifference between supplier prices and economic viability exists.\n\nThe subsidizing of photovoltaic research and development could\n\ncause a significant increase in penetration to occur. This is based\n\non the assumption that an advancement in research and development\n\nwould allow a significant cost reduction in the product, thus\n\nallowing a corresponding penetration increase.\n\nIn summary, the market risks are reduced primarily through\n\nmarket studies and end-user financial assistance. Other selected\n\nincentives will have a positive influence, but to a lesser degree.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY RISKS\n\nThere is a tremendous variation in the effect of government\n\nincentives on the barriers associated with technology risk. A given\n\nincentive may have both positive and negative effects within the\n\ntechnological risk spectrum. The principal concern in the techno\xc2\xad\nlogical area to an investing company is the obsolescence of their\n\nproposed investment before they are able to obtain a reasonable\n\nfinancial reward.\n\nThe subsidizing of photovoltaic research and development\n\nactivities represents a significant negative influence on this\n\nobsolescence barrier. Through subsidizing research and development\n\nactivities that produce rapid technological advancements, the risks\n\nare increased that some new technology will be devised that will\n\nobsolete present-day established technological bases. An investment\n\nin present-day technology could very easily be obsoleted long before\n\na financial reward could be obtained. Any advancements thus brought\n\nthrough R&D subsidies may actually act as an increase to the barriers\n\nto inducing other companies to invest or at least act as a delaying\n\nfactor in considering the photovoltaic venture.\n\nThere are other incentives, however, that can produce a\n\nreduction in the barrier associated with obsolescence. These would\n\ninclude the subsidizing of prices and the guaranteeing of at least\n\n\n152\n\nEl Gnostk Concepts nc\n\n\nminimum market levels. Through these programs, the investment could\n\nbe recouped. Such programs tend, however, to cause costs and prices\n\nto remain at higher levels than would otherwise be expected. If the\n\nmarket is.\nguaranteed, then there is little incentive to reduce costs\n\nand become more competitive. The same is true if prices are to be\n\nsubsidized.\n\nAn incentive that tends to delay the obsolescence of an\n\ninvestment is the GFE approach. The effective investment is\n\nsignificantly reduced through the GFE approach, therefore requiring\n\nless time to recoup the investment. The GFE and management fee\n\nroute, however, is only effective for a limited time, especially if\n\nthrough research and development activities a new low-cost process\n\nor manufacturing procedure is developed.\n\nThe other disadvantage of the GFE and management incentive is\n\nthat it tends to freeze technology and discourages further develop\xc2\xad\nment. Through the installation of significant-sized GFE facilities,\n\nthe manufacturing techniques and the dominant technologies are\n\nfrozen, thus allowing only minimal reductions in prices through the\n\naccumulated volume concept.\n\nProduction demonstrations offer a possibility of decreasing\n\nthe obsolescence barrier in that they demonstrate that certain tech\xc2\xad\nnologies can effectively and at some price level produce photovoltaic\n\nproducts or components.\n\nThe risks associated with unknown systems requirements can\n\nonly be effectively reduced through field experiments and demonstra\xc2\xad\ntion projects. This method offers significant possibilities for\n\nidentifying many systems-related problems that would not otherwise\n\nbe detectable in a laboratory or through a paper study of the system.\n\nThere is the possibility that the concept of a subsidized\n\nphotovoltaic research and development program could be expanded to\n\ninclude laboratory evaluations of systems. This might offer some\n\npossibility of decreasing risks associated wih systems requirements.\n\nNone of the other listed government incentive packages offer little\n\nif any possibility of reducing the risks associated with this\n\nbarrier.\n\n\nATTITUDE TOWARD GOVERNMENT PRESENCE\n\nThe presence of the government in a given area of development\n\nor market can be looked upon in various fashions by a company. It\n\nis interesting to note that one division of a company may view the\n\ngovernment presence as an asset, while another division may view\n\ngovernment presence as a deficit. There are companies that have\n\nconsidered the photovoltaic venture and dismissed it as a viable\n\n\nG bttc Conct\'pt Inc\n\n153\n\nventure in some of their commercial-based divisions, and yet have\n\nfound it to be a venture worth consideration within their government\n\nelectronics or aerospace divisions. Viability refers to either an\n\ninvestment in the photovoltaic venture on a commercial basis or the\n\ncontinued development of research and development activities with\n\nthe future potential of developing a commercial product.\n\nIn general, the establishment of government programs is viewed\n\nto have a negative effect in that they tend to increase the barrier\n\nto investments. Policies, on the other hand, are not viewed in a\n\nnegative fashion. In fact, policies tend to reduce the barriers.\n\nGovernment presence is considered to be a barrier in that it\n\ncauses a company to lose control of its own destiny or causes the\n\ndissemination of what might otherwise be proprietary technological\n\ninformation. The government programs tend to affect internal affairs\n\nof the company. Policies, by contrast, tend to affect market devel\xc2\xad\nopment aspects which are external to the company\'s immediate affairs\n\nand controllability.\n\nThe most damaging government incentives to the barrier of\n\ngovernment presence is government-furnished equipment, management\n\nfees, and production demonstrations. For those companies that do\n\nnot wish to have government interference with development activities,\n\nthese three areas hit the hardest at destroying their incentive to\n\ninvest in a given venture. They, in effect, put weaker competitors\n\non an equal footing with what would otherwise be a strong competitor.\n\nA similar influence is resultant from government subsidizing\n\nphotovoltaic research and development projects. Again, this is\n\nviewed as an invasion of a company\'s potential proprietary techno\xc2\xad\nlogical position or domain. Quite often companies will refuse to\n\nparticipate in government-subsidized R&D programs because of the\n\nrequirement for the general dissemination of all pertinent informa\xc2\xad\ntion that is derived. In addition, it may even result in the dis\xc2\xad\nsemination of proprietary information in other areas that may have\n\nbeen used as a basis upon which the new R&D information was derived.\n\nSubsidizing prices and guaranteeing minimum market levels are\n\nalso considered to have a negative influence upon this investment\n\nbarrier. These incentives tend to distort or overrule normal market\n\nconditions. To take advantage of such incentives often has associ\xc2\xad\nated with it many government restrictions and regulations, including\n\nsignificant paper work to justify prices and levels of involvement.\n\nThus these incentives, while affecting the market which would\n\nnormally be considered an external involvement as discussed in\n\nconnection with policies, have serious ramifications internal to the\n\ncompany. These ramifications are interpreted as risk areas, even\n\nthough there may be some prospective revenues associated with them.\n\n\n154\n\nE\n\nCmticCunfptl\n\nThe most effective government incentives to overcome the\n\nbarrier of attitude toward government presence is in the area of\n\npolicies, primarily that of implementing end-user financial\n\nassistance and providing supplier tax preferences. End-user finan\xc2\xad\ncial assistance tends to significantly influence an increase in\n\nmarket demand. Supplier tax preferences allow a reduction in the\n\ncost of producing the products and translates into an increased\n\nability to penetrate markets. This ability to penetrate markets may\n\nnot actually occur, but the prospect of being able to write off\n\nequipment early or reduce the tax liability of the company tends to\n\nact as a reduction on the perceived barrier.\n\n\nCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT\n\n\nThe barrier of competitive environment is reduced by almost\n\nall government incentives. The primary reason is that most govern\xc2\xad\nment incentives tend to put all competitors on an equal basis. Thus\n\na company considering entering a high-risk and high-capital-intensive\n\ninvestment such as the photovoltaic venture would want as many\n\nadvantages given to them through government programs and policies as\n\npossible to enhance their position at the time of entrance.\n\nIt is interesting to note, however, that once a company has\n\nbecome significantly entrenched within the venture, their viewpoint\n\nof many of these incentives begins to change to that held by\n\ncompanies who consider government presence to be a barrier. In other\n\nwords, once they have established themselves, they prefer government\n\nincentives not to be implemented for the encouragement of further\n\ncompetitors entering the marketplace. Government incentives tend to\n\nfavor the weaker companies and restrict the stronger competitors.\n\nThe competitive environment barrier acts as a screen that\n\ndiscourages weak or nonqualified companies from entering a venture.\n\nIf the competitive barrier is reduced significantly, then there will\n\nbe a tendency for a larger number of companies to invest. In\n\ngeneral, they will be the smaller companies with fewer resources. A\n\nfostering of a large number of small competitors simply dilutes the\n\navailable government resources and in no way adds to an accumulation\n\nof industry experience. However, applying those same resources to a\n\nlimited number of investors better ensures that each investor has a\n\nmuch larger base of accumulated knowledge, experience, and expertise\n\nin advancing the venture.\n\nThis could be carried to extremes in which all resources were\n\ninvested in only one company, such that all experience would then be\n\nshared. However, it would destroy the competitive aspect of the free\n\nenterprise system and in effect become a totally government-dominated\n\n\nF Gnostic Concepts. Inc\n\n155\n\nor at least -regulated industry.- A constant watch must be made upon\n\nhow the industrialization process is proceeding to ensure that a\n\nreasonable compromise between competitive environment and the\n\nability to accumulate large quantities of information, technology,\n\nexperience, and expertise occurs.\n\n\nINSTITUTIONAL ISSUES\n\nThe institutional issues that can act as a barrier to invest\xc2\xad\nments can only be effectively reduced through either field experi\xc2\xad\nments and demonstrations or properly designed market studies, with\n\nthe field experiments and demonstrations having by far the greater\n\neffect in resolving problems. The market studies hold the potential\n\nof identifying the institutional issues but in no way could offer\n\nhard and tried solutions. None of the other available incentives\n\nhave an effect upon this barrier.\n\n\nBALANCE OF SYSTEM COSTS\n\nThe barrier associated with the balance of systems costs will\n\nbe a difficult one to overcome through government incentives. Field\n\nexperiments and demonstration projects can only identify what these\n\nother system costs will be and what their effective levels are likely\n\nto be. Without some systematic research and development effort\n\ndirected at the specific components that are causing the system costs\n\nto decrease at a much slower rate than desirable, there is little\n\nthat can be done through government incentives.\n\nThe use of end-user financial assistance policies may be one\n\nmethod of reducing the overall cost of the system. If.\nthe policy is\n\ndirected at financial assistance on what the end-user paid for only\n\nthe photovoltaic panel, then it would have little effect upon the\n\nbalance of systems cost. If, however, the financial assistance was\n\nbased upon what was paid for the functional system, then the finan\xc2\xad\ncial assistance could be applied to reduce whatever component costs\n\nare causing the overall systems costs to be out of line.\n\nSupplier tax preference would not have a significant influence\n\nupon reducing the balance of systems cost barriers. However, if it\n\ncould be applied to the suppliers of the other high-cost components\n\nwithin the system, then an effective reduction of this barrier could\n\nbe obtained. However, the ramifications are significant in this\n\ncase. For instance, would the tax preference be applied only to\n\ncomponents sold into photovoltaic applications, or would it be given\n\nin a general fashion regardless of how the components were distrib\xc2\xad\nuted throughout the marketplace? To make supplier tax preference an\n\neffective tool for reducing this barrier, careful study and\n\nconsideration must first be applied.\n\n\n156\n\nGostdc Concepts Inc\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVES AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS\n\nOf all of the government incentives, the field experimentation\n\nand demonstration programs offer the broadest effect across the\n\nperceived barriers. It has significant influence in reducing the\n\nrisks associated with systems requirements and the resolving of\n\ninstitutional issues. It has a noticeabl\'e effect upon reducing risks\n\nassociated with proper market identification and characterization,\n\ngathering of basic knowledge in the use and reliablity of photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaics, a reduction in the competitive environment barrier, and\n\noffers possibilities of identifying and characterizing the balance\n\nof systems costs under actual usage conditions.\n\nIt also offers some possibility for reducing the perceived\n\nlow financial rewards and assisting to some extent in enhancing\n\npenetration possibilities within certain markets. None of the other\n\ngovernment incentives offer as broad a range of effectiveness.\n\nThere are a number of other incentives that offer a limited\n\nrange of effectiveness. These include:\n\n@\na\ne\n*\n*\n\nMarket studies\n\nSupplier tax preferences\n\nEnd-user financial assistance\n\nSubsidizing photovoltaic research and development activities\n\nProduction demonstrations\n\n\nThe remaining incentives listed in Table 4.1 have relatively\n\nlittle, if any, positive influence upon reducing barriers. This\n\nwould include subsidizing prices, government-funded equipment,\n\nmanagement fee, and market guarantees. Loan guarantees seem to have\n\nno influence, either positive or negative, in reducing investment\n\nbarriers.\n\n\nSGnstc Concept.\n\nInc\n\n157\n\n4.5\n\nR\'E C 0 M M E N D A T I 0 N S\n\n\nRANK ING\n\nOF\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nINCENTIVES\n\n\nIn Section 4.4 was a listing of the government incentives\n\nbased on their breadth of positive influence. In effect, it was\n\nbased only upon the number of areas in which a given incentive would\n\nhave a positive effect. That arrangement was not influenced by the\n\ndegree of effectiveness upon a given barrier or any emphasis placed\n\nupon their effect on major barriers that are more common among a\n\nlarger number of potential investors in the photovoltaic venture.\n\nTo add some analytical perspective to this listing, a weighting of\n\ninfluences must be established for the various perceived barriers\n\nand the effectiveness that a given incentive has upon that barrier.\n\nAn incentive that has a significant positive influence upon\n\nreducing a major or predominant perceived barrier would have greater\n\nvalue than when applied against a less dominant perceived barrier.\n\nConversely, an incentive that tends to significantly increase a\n\ndominant or common barrier should have a significantly lower value\n\nassociated with it.\n\nWEIGHTING OF BARRIERS\nA weighting system is shown in Table\n\n4.2, in which low financial reward, high risk associated with\n\nmarkets, the high risks associated with technological obsolescence,\n\nand the institutional issues are considered to be the dominant\n\nperceived barriers to the photovoltaic investment and have a higher\n\nweighting. The second-order effects are those risks associated with\n\nsystems requirements and the balance of systems costs. The other\n\nperceived barriers are known to exist but do not appear to be the\n\ndominant restrictors in an expansion of the photovoltaic venture.\n\nThis evaluation of the perceived barriers was based on\n\nextensive field interviews with companies both in and outside of the\n\nphotovoltaic industry. Those companies outside the photovoltaic\n\nindustry were further subdivided into those considering and those\n\nthat have already rejected the photovoltaic venture as a viable\n\ninvestment area.\n\nFor the more dominant and commonly perceived barriers that\n\nrestrict the photovoltaic venture from attracting more companies, a\n\nweighting factor of three times the normal emphasis has been applied.\n\nFor the secondary barriers, a weighting factor of two times the\n\nnormal emphasis has been assigned, and the remaining barriers were\n\nassigned a unit value of emphasis.

Here a no-effect incentive received a\n\nzero weighting. A positive unit value was assigned to any incentive\n\neffect that decreases the investment barrier, and a two-unit value\n\nwas assigned to any incentive that has a significant decrease on a\n\nperceived barrier. Conversely, a negative unit value was assigned\n\nto any incentive that tended to increase the perceived barriers, and\n\na negative two units of value were assigned to those incentives that\n\ncaused significant increases in barriers.\n\nFor those cases in which an incentive tends to decrease or\n\nincrease a barrier only under special conditions, a half unit of\n\ncounter value was assigned to those cases. For instance, any\n\nincentive producing a decrease in the barrier would normally receive\n\na one-unit value. However, because it is only under special condi\xc2\xad\ntions or under limited duration, the positive one unit of value was\n\nreduced by the 0.5 counter value, resulting in only a 0.5 value\n\nassigned to that incentive in relation to that given investment\n\n\nCnostic Concepts, Inc\n\n159\n\nbarrier,. When applied toward those areas in which incentives tended\n\nto increase the barrier, the 0.5 counter value was used to reduce\n\nthe effective increase in that perceived barrier.\n\nAgain, this is an arbitrary scale subject to judgment and\n\ninterpretation. It does, however, add some analytical basis upon\n\nwhich a given interaction between an incentive and a perceived\n\nbarrier can be evaluated.\n\nAPPLICATION OF WEIGHTING FACTORS\nThe weighting scale is\n\napplied to the results of Table 4.1 in the following fashion. The\n\ndesignated effect was replaced by the weighted value shown in the\n\nlower portion of Table 4.2. It was then multiplied by the weighting\n\nfactor associated with that perceived barrier, as shown in the upper\n\nportion of Table 4.2.

Those incentives that were deemed to have a\n\nsignificant portion of their value associated with absolute barriers\n\n\'are marked by an asterisk in the last column.\n\n\nGnostic Concepts, Inc\n\n161\n\nIt is interesting to note that when the numerical weighting\n\nfactors were applied to the effect of the incentives that no\n\nsignificant shifting of the ranking occurred when compared to the\n\nranking of those incentives based strictly on the breadth of their\n\npositive influence. In other words, those incentives with the\n\nbroadest area of effectiveness generally received the higher\n\nnumerical value associated with their-effectiveness when all barriers\n\nwere taken into consideration. A more significant shifting of the\n\nrankings occurred when the absolute barriers are removed from the\n\nranking process.\n\nSUBSIDIZING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT NOT EFFECTIVE IN INDUCING\n\nINVESTMENT\nParticular note should be made of the ranking of\n\nthe subsidizing of photovoltaic research and development projects.\n\nIts ranking, when considering all barrier types, was number five.\n\nHowever, if only secondary barriers are considered, this incentive\n\ndrops to the number ten ranking position.\n\nThe implication is that except for the fact that such an\n\nincentive reduces the required investment, it has little effect upon\n\ninducing companies to enter the photovoltaic venture. In fact, the\n\nfield interviews indicated that the investment in the photovoltaic\n\nventure on a commercial basis by all but one company was made\n\nindependently of considering that the government would in some\n\nfashion subsidize at least a portion of a prospective company\'s\n\nresearch and development activities. In other words, a company\'s\n\ndecision to enter the photovoltaic venture was based on other\n\nconsiderations and not the fact that the government is subsidizing\n\nresearch and development.\n\nThis does not mean that a company once in the photovoltaic\n\nventure will totally ignore the money being made available through\n\ngovernment funding of research and development activities, but it\n\ndoes not play a significant role in inducing companies to enter the\n\nphotovoltaic venture on a commercial basis. Those incentives that\n\ntend to develop the markets have the greatest effect upon reducing\n\nbarriers and inducing companies to enter the marketplace. This would\n\ninclude items such as field experiments and demonstrations, market\n\nstudies, and end-user financial assistance.\n\nSTIMULATING MARKET BETTER THAN CONTROLLING MARKET\n\n[hose items that had the effect ot controlling the market or\n\nredirecting it, such as subsidizing prices and market guarantees,\n\ntended to have a low ranking. This indicates that companies prefer\n\nto have the market conditions left to the natural forces rather than\n\ncontrolled. Controlling a market generally disinterests prospective\n\ninvestors because they, in most cases, are unable to use their prin\xc2\xad\ncipal strengths and assets to a maximum potential. If, however,\n\ngovernment incentives tend to stimulate the natural development of\n\nthe market, then this provides even greater opportunities for\n\nprospective investors to take advantage of their particular company\n\nstrengths and maximize the return on the investment.\n\n\n162\n\nF= Cntsc Convcpt. Inc\n\nLOW RANKING FOR GFE AND MANAGEMENT FEE\nThe major influence\n\nthat the GFE and management fee incentives offer is in the area of\n\nthe absolute barriers. This is because they have a significant\n\ninfluence upon the base on which an investment is evaluated and the\n\nreturns or revenues are measured. The ranking, however, of these\n\nincentives is still extremely low regardless of which method of\n\nmeasuring or weighting is used.\n\nThe major reason for their overall low ranking stems from the\n\nfact that industry views these two particular incentives as having a\n\nsignificant influence upon the company\'s internal affairs and have\n\nassociated with them various restrictions or hinderances that are\n\nnot deemed worthwhile. Few companies find these incentives very\n\ndesirable when involved with a highly competitive commercial market\n\nin which technology is rapidly changing. This does not mean that\n\nGFE and management fee routes have no place at all in the American\n\nindustrial complex. It just means it does not have applicable use\n\nin the case of photovoltaics.\n\nPRODUCTION DEMONSTRATIONS BIAS CONDITIONS\nProduction\n\ndemonstrations have relatively little influence upon inducing\n\ncompanies to enter the photovoltaic venture. Most companies are\n\npursuing their own unique production routes independent of the\n\ninvolvement of the federal government in such activities or areas.\n\nEach company is building a production facility based on their own\n\nbeliefs of what is best, most efficient, and economical for them.\n\nProduction demonstrations can be thought of as the development\n\naspect of research and development activities.\n\nThe real benefit of production demonstrations seems to be in\n\nthe early attraction of those companies that were interested in doing\n\nthe work in that particular area in the first place. They probably\n\nhad reasons for not pursuing it internally, but because of the funds\n\navailable through production demonstration projects, these companies\n\nwere able to justify an earlier pursuit of the project.\n\nIn addition, these companies probably expected no proprietary\n\nposition to evolve out of these projects. Their hope is that by\n\nparticipating in the early developmental stages of these production\n\ndemonstration projects, they will be in a prime position to be\n\nknowledgeable and experienced with these new procedures, techniques,\n\nand technologies that are brought to light in production demonstra\xc2\xad\ntions. The benefit is then derived from actually having done the\n\nproject rather than from knowing what the results of the project are.\n\nThey are then positioned to that advantage of their experience when\n\nthe market does develop.\n\nFor this reason. production demonstrations tend to bias that\n\nportion of the market and supply area toward the insiders or the ones\n\nthat participated in the demonstration projects and does not seem to\n\noffer significant advantages to those outside of the project. The\n\n\nSGnostic Concepts, Inc\n\n163\n\nfact that a production demonstration project was implemented does\n\nhave the influence of probably accelerating the time frame in which\n\nthe prospective company was originally planning to make the necessary\n\ninvestments in the technology and pilot facilities associated with\n\nthe project. From this perspective, it could be said that production\n\ndemonstrations accelerate the development of the supply aspect and\n\ncauses companies to commit to the venture prior to their otherwise\n\nplanned time frame.\n\nLOAN GUARANTEES HAVE NO EFFECT\nLoan guarantees appear to\n\nrank at the bottom regardless of what scheme is used. This is not\n\nbecause they have significant negative influences upon reducing\n\nbarriers or risk factors, but they seem to have no positive\n\ninfluence, especially in connection with a prospective investing\n\ncompany. The possible use of loan guarantees may better be applied\n\nat the end-user level if for some reason an end-user is limited in\n\npurchasing photovoltaic-powered products because of availability of\n\nmoney. By establishing loan guarantees, possibly an end-user could\n\nbe stimulated into purchasing photovoltaic products.\n\nThe agricultural field may be a prime area that would most\n\nbenefit from loan guarantees. Most farm equipment and facilities\n\nare installed with borrowed money. Assuming that cost-effective\n\nphotovoltaic products could be brought to the agricultural market,\n\nthen a loan guarantee might assure that the agricultural industry\n\ncould and would implement the photovoltaic products.\n\nIn most other market areas, however, availability of funds is\n\nnot the expected limitation in the use of photovoltaics. It will\n\nalso tend to lose its significance in the agricultural field as the\n\nindividual farmer in the US is replaced by large corporate farming\n\nactivities. These corporate farming groups will tend to have greater\n\nfinancial assets available to them and will have a less need for loan\n\nguarantees.\n\n\nRECOMMENDED GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES\n\nBased upon the influences that various government incentives\n\nhave upon the overall spectrum of investment barriers and perceived\n\nrisks, the ranking or classifying of government incentives into\n\nrecommended and not recommended use is shown in Table 4.5. In addi\xc2\xad\ntion, two incentive options have been listed as having possible use\n\nunder special conditions. The recommended government incentives are:\n\n*\n*\n*\na\n*\n\n164\n\nSubsidize research and development activities\n\nEstablish supplier tax preferences\n\nMarket studies\n\nField experiments and demonstrations\n\nEstablish end-user tax preferences\n\nE Gnostc Concepts, Inc\n\nTABLE 4.5\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS ON GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES\n\nGovernment Action \t\n\nCommentary\n\n\nRecommended\n\nSubsidize R&D \t\n\nMost effective cost reduction program\n\n\nSupplier tax preference \t\n\nReduce low financial reward barrier\n\n\nMarket studies \t\n\nDirect at basic driving forces of\n\nmarkets, expand to detailed international\n\nscope, cover institutional issues\n\n\nField experiments/demonstrations \t\n\nRedirect emphases to eiperimental\n\naspects, direct at future markets on\n\ntimely basis\n\n\nEnd-user financial assistance \t\n\nStimulate market demand, begin with large\n\nincentive but decrease as prices decline\n\n\nPossible\n\nProduction demonstrations \t\n\nDirected at only common materials or\n\nitems for all suppliers; tends to exclude\n\noutsiders, biases market in favor of\n\ninsiders\n\n\nLoan guarantees \t\n\nAppears to have no real influence; may\n\nassist new company formation or special\n\ntemporary company conditions; best\n\napplied to users if needed to stimulate\n\nmarket\n\n\nNot Recommended\n\nSubsidize prices \t\n\nOverrules incentive to reduce costs,\n\nprolongs inefficiencies, slows technology\n\nadvancement.\n\n\nMarket guarantee \t\n\nKeeps prices up; inefficient use of tax\n\ndollars, similar influence to price\n\nsubsidies\n\n\nGFE \t\n\nBiases market, does not stimulate market\n\nor advance R&D, freezes production\n\ntechnology, reduces implementation\n\n\nManagement fee \t\n\nSame as GFE\n\n\nThe two possible government incentives that could be imple\xc2\xad\nmented under certain conditions are production demonstrations and\n\nloan guarantees.

Before application of these\n\nincentives, however, significant study should be applied to their\n\nneeds and their effect upon the overall long-range objectives of the\n\nindustrialization process. If they can be implemented without\n\ninterfering or distorting developments within a company or overruling\n\nnormal market conditions, then they could very possibly be applied\n\ninto specific areas.\n\nAPPLICATION SEQUENCE OF INCENTIVES IMPORTANT\nIn the area of\n\nthe recommended government incentives, it is important to note that\n\nthe sequence in which incentives are applied can accelerate or hinder\n\nthe industrialization process. For instance, it is important that\n\ntechnology be developed first, upon which field experiments and later\n\ndemonstrations can be based. It would be unwise to label a field\n\n\n166\n\n72j Gnostic Concepts, Inc\n\nexperiment as a demonstration when the technology had not been fully\n\nresolved. A failure in this case would act as a retardant force\n\nupon the market area to which it was exposed, and possibly discourage\n\ncompanies from entering the photovoltaic venture.\n\nIt would also be wiser to provide the supplier with tax\n\npreferences early in the development stage rather than to the\n\nend-user. An overstimulation of the market conditions could cause\n\nprices to remain at a higher than otherwise expected level.\n\nThe implementation of an end-user tax preference too early\n\nmay be insufficient to account for the difference in selling price\n\nand the price needed to induce the end-user to purchase a\n\nphotovoltaic-powered product. Thus the tax preference would have\n\nlittle relevance to the mass public. Only the very wealthy would be\n\nable to take advantage of the tax preference. Thus it could be\n\nconcluded by the general public that government was once again\n\nfavoring those who have great financial resources and discriminating\n\nagainst the lesser wealthy individuals within the population.\n\nEnd-user tax preferences must be in relationship to the\n\ndifference between selling price and the price the end-user would\n\nnormally pay for some other source of energy. If that delta\n\ndifference is extremely large, this would be an extremely inefficient\n\nuse of tax funds. Those funds could better be directed at subsidiz\xc2\xad\ning the research and development activity and providing a basis for\n\nreducing costs on the supplier side.\n\nA well-coordinated program is thus needed before government\n\nincentives are to be applied. Timing is important in the overall\n\neffect of the government incentives. The fundamental basis for the\n\nphotovoltaic venture is the technology. Second is the supply of\n\ncost-effective products, and third the stimulation and development\n\nof the market to consume the output from production facilities.\n\n\nMSstc Concept\n\nInc\n\n167\n\n5.Leading Indicators\n\n\n5.1\n\n0 B J E C T I V E S\n\n\nThe principal intent is to identify those leading indicators\n\nthat give constructive and timely feedback concerning the influence\n\nof government incentives on the industrialization process. It would\n\nbe desirable to know, for example, the immediate effect of an\n\nincentive on market development and investments in the photovoltaic\n\nventure. By monitoring such indicators, it would then be possible\n\nto withdraw or at least modify incentives that are either not\n\neffective or creating negative influences.\n\nSeveral indicators could be selected that would provide\n\ninformation concerning the progress of the industrialization process.\n\nHowever, due to the timing of these indicators, they can hardly be\n\nconsidered as leading indicators. Such an indicator would be, for\n\ninstance, the number of firms participating in the photovoltaic\n\nventure. This is an after-the-fact indicator. It does indicate how\n\neffective government incentives have been, but does not offer the\n\ntimely feedback aspect that is desired.\n\nThe decision of a company to enter the photovoltaic venture\n\nor to significantly expand its present level of participation will\n\nin general be kept secret until the last moment. In fact, additional\n\ninvestments by companies that are already in the photovoltaic venture\n\nmay not be noticeable outside the company for many months after\n\nhaving been made. It will, of course, be obvious at the time of the\n\nannouncement of a product that a new company has decided to enter\n\nthe photovoltaic venture. However, the decision to make the invest\xc2\xad\nment would have occurred many months in advance of the product\n\nannouncement.\n\nThe conclusion is that it will be very difficult if possible\n\nat all to know the exact position of any company, either presently\n\nin or contemplating entrance into the photovoltaic venture. Leading\n\nindicators in their true sense may then be virtually impossible to\n\nidentify.\n\n\nEMGEDING PAGE BLANK NO"\n\nSGnostic Concepts, Inc\n\n169\n\n\nLeading indicators will be only relative in their nature and\n\nin the true sense of the word may not be leading at all. Identifi\xc2\xad\nable indicators will undoubtedly have a significant degree of delay\n\nbuilt into them because of the secretive environment that will\n\nsurround a potential investment decision. This is a natural occur\xc2\xad\nrence within the highly competitive industrial environment prevalent\n\nwithin the US. It should not be looked upon negatively or with\n\ngreat disappointment, but instead viewed with the perspective that\n\ncompanies have a legitimate need to protect their proprietary and\n\nconfidential position until it is determined in the best interest of\n\nthe company to announce their decisions and intended actions.\n\n\n170\n\nF2 Gnostic Concepts Inc\n\n5.2 \t I N D I C A T 0 R S A S S 0 C I A T E D W I T H\n\nQUANTITATIVE\nELEMENTS\nOF THE\n\nINVESTMENT\nE N VI RON MEN T\n\n\nFINANC IAL\n\nANALYSIS\n\nELEMENTS\n\n\nEach company, when considering the photovoltaic venture, will\n\nhave calculated a certain ROI and other critical financial measure\xc2\xad\nments. These financial measurements will have entirely different\n\nvalues at each company even though they were based on the same\n\navailable information concerning market conditions. This is due to\n\nthe variations in company resources such as the cost of money and\n\nexpected revenues. A leading indicator showing the direction in\n\nwhich a company is moving would be associated with the change in\n\nthese financial measurements. If the measurements were becoming more\n\noptimistic, then it could be concluded that the government incentives\n\nwere enhancing the prospects for that company to invest in the\n\nphotovoltaic venture.\n\nIf a set of baseline conditions could be established for a\n\ngiven company or a group of companies, then any change in the base\xc2\xad\nline conditions could act as a leading indicator. These baseline\n\nconditions associated with the financial measurements of the venture\n\nmay have to be specialized for various company groupings. Several\n\nsets of baseline conditions would therefore have to be established,\n\nwith each set describing a particular grouping of companies as they\n\ngenerally perceive the financial measurements.\n\nThe development of this baseline set of conditions implies\n\nthe establishment of a listing of companies considering the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture and a set of company profiles containing knowledge\n\nof what these firms require for the final investment decision to be\n\nfavorable. Obtaining such information, however, could be extremely\n\ndifficult and would require a high degree of trust that such\n\ninformation would not become public.\n\nSome companies would not mind sharing this information,\n\nespecially if the financial measurements indicate that the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture is not a worthwhile opportunity. It is those\n\ncompanies that are close to making a positive decision that would\n\nnot wish to reveal their perception of the venture. Often companies\n\nare willing to share general type information as to their require\xc2\xad\nments for entering a new venture. Those requirements, however, are\n\n9enerally ideal and are often modified when applied against an actual\n\ninvestment opportunity.\n\n\nF= Gnostc Concepts, Inc\n\n171\n\nEven though it appears it would be virtually impossible to\n\nhave a continual dialogue occur with a large cross-section of\n\nAmerican companies concerning detailed i6formation about their\n\nposition on the photovoltaic venture, this should not prevent the\n\nestablishment of theoretical baseline conditions. Associated with\n\nthis theoretical set of baseline conditions could also be a sensi\xc2\xad\ntivity analysis that would indicate what the effect of a given\n\nincentive could possibly produce. If the proper inputs to these\n\ntheoretical baseline conditions were within reason, then there could\n\nbe some confidence level associated with the sensitivity analysis\n\nperformed. The sensitivity analysis could be coupled with a sampling\n\nof potential photovoltaic investors to verify or modify the\n\nconclusions generated from the analysis.\n\nThe basis for such a program is conceivably contained within\n\nthe JPL-SAMICS program. What is needed is industry inputs to estab\xc2\xad\nlish the proper baseline conditions. Through periodic sampling,\n\nthese conditions could be updated and compared to prior results.\n\n\n"C H A M P I 0 N"\n\nE L E M E N T\n\n\nOne of the principal elements that must be present in the\n\ninvestment environment is the "champion" of the proposed investment.\n\nThe "champion" will be the principal figure involved in pressing for\n\na positive final decision.

The "champion" will,\n\nhowever, be in a position to know what information is available, what\n\nis still lacking, and the status of the resources available to\n\nfulfill the investment criteria.\n\nThe identification and continual communication with the\n\n"champions" at each prospective company could become a type of lead\xc2\xad\ning indicator. Through the communication links associated with these\n\n"champions," it would be possible to obtain feedback information that\n\ncould be used to modify existing government incentives or those\n\nincentives that are under consideration. A "testing" of the govern\xc2\xad\nment incentives under consideration could be obtained through the\n\nreaction of the "champions"\' at each of the identified companies.\n\nThis type of leading indicator would not require the govern\xc2\xad\nment to be informed as to the proprietary position a company holds\n\non a photovoltaic venture consideration, but it could gain insight\n\nas to the possible reaction of a given company to a proposed\n\nincentive. While this leading indicator would not be quantitative\n\nin its output, it could provide significant qualitative inputs.\n\n\n172\n\nF\n\nCnosrk Concepts. Inc\n\nPRODUCT\n\nSTANDARDIZATION\n\n\nStandardization of products is a measure of maturity within\n\nan industry. Standardization occurs when an industry has confidence\n\nin a market area and believes that certain product types will\n\ncontinue for some reasonable time period.\n\nThe appearance of product standards would thus act as an\n\nindicator that the photovoltaic industry is maturing and has confi\xc2\xad\ndence in the future. This is, however, an after-the-fact indicator\n\nand offers no real timely feedback. If the industry establishes\n\nstandards under pressure from the government, then even product\n\nstandardization may not be a legitimate indicator. For it to indi\xc2\xad\ncate maturity and confidence, it must evolve from within the industry\n\nrather than from government enforcement.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nAUTOMATION\n\n\nA significant indicator of the commitment to the photovoltaic\n\nventure is the degree to which technologies are automated. Automa\xc2\xad\ntion implies that a company envisions conditions to have stabilized\n\nfor at least a certain period. It.also indicates that the company\n\nhas decided which avenues it will pursue in the production of\n\nphotovoltaic products.\n\nSuch an indicator would apply only to those companies already\n\nin the photovoltaic venture. Knowledge of the automation may not be\n\nreadily available, especially prior to its actual implementation.\n\nThe general announcement of the intent to automate or that automation\n\nhas occurred within a company will be only at the time when the\n\ncompany feels it is advantageous in the marketplace for it to be\n\nknown. It is unlikely that the intent to automate will be widely\n\ndisseminated. Once the investment has been made in automation,\n\nhowever, it may be widely announced to establish a commitment to the\n\nproduct in the eyes of the end-users.\n\nAt best, this leading indicator might also be considered an\n\nafter-the-fact indicator, since automation will be one of the last\n\ninvestments made by a company in the photovoltaic venture. Automa\xc2\xad\ntion only occurs when stabilized conditions exist. Such stabilized\n\nconditions generally do not exist in the early stages of a company\'s\n\ninvestment in a new venture.\n\n\nGnostk Concep\n\nInc\n\n173\n\nTAX\n\nREPORTS\n\n\nEND-USER INFORMATION\nThe overall objective of the indus\xc2\xad\ntrialization process is to stimulate lower prices and higher volumes\n\nof production and consumption. To arrive at an indication of market\n\nprices and the volumes involved, the use of the income tax reporting\n\nforms could be employed. If, for instance, an end-user stimulation\n\nwere developed that provided tax credits, rebates, or some appropri\xc2\xad\nate incentive, then it would be possible at the time the annual\n\nincome tax forms are filed to request certain information of\n\nend-users.\n\nThere could be a modification to the income tax reporting\n\nforms that require the end-user, whether it be an individual or a\n\ncompany, to report the total dollars spent on the photovoltaic\n\nsystems purchased during the year, the peak watt rating of the\n\nsystem, and any other pertinent information that was desired to\n\nindicate the volume and prices prevailing during the past year. From\n\nthis data a reasonable picture could be formulated as to what was\n\noccurring, at least on an annual basis, within the marketplace. It\n\ncould be determined if volumes were truly increasing and if prices\n\nwere actually decreasing in any proportionate rate to volume.\n\nSUPPLIER INFORMATION\nTo arrive at some indication of the\n\ninvestments on the part of the photovoltaic suppliers, it is also\n\npossible to use the income tax reporting form for companies. Certain\n\ntax credits or fast write-off of equipment expenditures and other\n\nR&D costs can act as a stimulus to a supplier. The requirement could\n\nbe added that if the stimulus is to be applied against the earnings\n\nof the company, then the company must report certain pertinent\n\ninformation within their tax form. Such information could include\n\nestimated number of man-hours devoted to photovoltaics, a listing of\n\nspecific equipment designated for the photovoltaic venture, capital\n\ncosts, or any other information that was deemed applicable to\n\nindicating the commitment of a company to the photovoltaic venture.\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY REQUIRED\nThe potential negative aspect of\n\nthese reporting channels is that the supplier may view this as \na\n\npotential invasion of his proprietary position within the venture\n\nand would not want such information to be made public. There must\n\ntherefore be associated with the collection of this information\n\nthrough the tax forms an environment of confidentiality.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service could accumulate the information\n\ncontained on the tax forms and provide a summation of the data, such\n\nthat the photovoltaic industry and the marketplace as a whole could\n\nbe characterized. It could thus be determined, for instance, if\n\ninvestments on the part of companies not presently in the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic marketplace are occurring. Itwould also indicate the\n\n\n174\n\nElGnstic Concepts, Inc\n\ncontinued commitment of additional funds on the part of companies\n\nalready within the photovoltaic venture. The overall results, while\n\nmade public, would not jeopardize any individual company\'s position.\n\nOFFERS CHECK ON OTHER DATA SOURCES\nThe information obtained\n\nconcerning the suppliers could legitimately be considered a leading\n\nindicator, even though the data is compiled on an annual basis. The\n\ndata collected from the end-user reports would certainly be a check\n\nand balance on data reported by either government market surveys or\n\nsuppliers as to the actual size of the marketplace. Over a period\n\nof time, the data collected from the suppliers could be correlated\n\nto the volume of product consumed in the marketplace and average\n\nprices. A one-to-one correlation may not exist as inventories can\n\nbe built at various points between the supplier and the end-user;\n\nbut even inventory information could possibly be part of the data\n\ncollection mechanism.\n\n\nATTENDEES\n\nAT\n\nPUBLIC\n\nMEETI NGS\n\n\nThe photovoltaic industry and the involvement with the\n\ngovernment has one characteristic that may add insights into\n\nprospective companies. Associated with the-photovoltaic venture is\n\nmany public meetings in which attendees register their name,\n\nposition, and company for which they work. This information could\n\nbecome valuable leading indicator material if properly analyzed.\n\nThe type of information that could be obtained from the attendee\n\nlists would include:\n\n*\nI\n*\n*\ne\n\nThe name of the companies sending representatives\n\nThe frequency of their attendance\n\nThe type of meetings to which companies send representatives\n\nThe number of representatives sent\n\nThe level or job position within a company that each of the\n\nattendees represents.\n\n\nThis information is already within the public domain and would\n\nrequire no new forms or data collection mechanisms. It would,\n\nhowever, require a systematic reduction of the data from all public\n\ngovernment meetings.\n\nWith the significant influence that the US government will\n\nplay in the industrialization process of the photovoltaic industry,\n\nit is unlikely that a company will consider entering the photovoltaic\n\nventure without sending a representative to at least certain key\n\nmeetings to gain information concerning the prospective investment.\n\nRepresentation at such a meeting, however, cannot be construed as a\n\nserious indicator that a company is considering the photovoltaic\n\nventure. It may very well be a private curiosity that brought the\n\nattendee to the meeting.\n\n\nF Gnostic Concepts. Inc.\n\n175\n\n5.3\n\nINDICATORS ASSOCIATED\nWITH\nQUALITATIVE\nELEMENTS\nOF\nTHE\nINVESTMENT\nENVIRONMENT\n\nGO V E R NM E N T\n\nP 0 S I T I O.N\n\n\nIt is important within the prospective photovoltaic companies\n\nthat the position of the government be well known. The clarification\n\nof the long-term position of the government is critical to the\n\ninvestment environment. Government involvement, or the lack of it,\n\nis not as important as knowing what the specific involvement will\n\nbe. An unknown government position can be more detrimental than the\n\nwrong government position. Industry prefers to work with known\n\nelements, even if they are not optimum or desirable.\n\nAn indicator of the usefulness of an incentive will be: "Does\n\nit clarify the long-term position of the government?" If it indeed\n\ndoes add clarification to the long-term intentions-of the government\n\nin the photovoltaic venture, then it can be expected to have more\n\npositive impact than it might otherwise. It would be advantageous\n\nupon the establishment of a new government incentive to obtain\n\nindustry\'s reaction as to their interpretation on whether it aids in\n\nclarifying the government\'s long-term position. If a sampling of\n\ncompanies indicated that it did indeed better clarify the long-term\n\nposition of the government, then it could be considered a positive\n\nincentive in that respect. If it offered no additional clarifica\xc2\xad\ntion, then its impact could be considered less than optimal. The\n\nleading indicator could thus be the reaction of industry. This is\n\nnot as quantitative an indicaor as is desired, but it does add\n\ninsight and feedback as to industry\'s view and confidence in the\n\ngovernment\'s position.\n\n\nMARKET\n\nIDENTIFICATION\n\n\nA key indicator of the role of government market studies would\n\nbe whether the results of such studies,were being used to formulate\n\ncompany business plans. The identification of photovoltaic markets\n\nand their basic driving forces is critical to any investment plans.\n\nMarket identification studies on the part of the government should\n\nbe challenged as to whether they are adding perspective to the\n\nidentified markets that did not previously exist.\n\nThere may be may identified markets in the photovoltaic\n\nventute. Another indicator as to the commitment of industry would\n\nbe how many of these identified markets are being served on a\n\n\n176\n\n:\n\nGnosticconcepts\n\nInc\n\ncommercial basis. If a market is served on a commercial basis, this\n\nindicates that industry has been able to develop products and manu\xc2\xad\nfacturing procedures that are technically and economically viable.\n\nThere will, however, be identified markets in which the\n\nproduct may technically be compatible but may not offer the economic\n\nviability required for penetration. A key indicator as to the\n\neffectivity of the market research studies would be, "Does the report\n\nor study resolve problems associated with these nonserved markets?\n\nDo they in any fashion offer insights into penetrations of these\n\nnonserved markets?" If there are no identifiable government actions\n\ndirected at resolving issues within the nonserved markets and appli\xc2\xad\ncations, then this would indicate a lacking in the government\n\nprograms and policies.\n\nProbably the best indicator as to the effectiveness of\n\ngovernment market identification and development studies is whether\n\nor not industry actually uses the data provided by such services.\n\nIt is easy for government reports to be biased to accent a given\n\nperspective. In the case of photovoltaics, it is possible that\n\ngovernment market studies have been overly optimistic or, where they\n\nhave been aggressive, have failed to supply the needed supportive\n\ninformation that could justify penetration of markets on a timely\n\nbasis. It would certainly be expected that early market studies\n\nwould be more optimistic to encourage the investment in the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic venture. If, however, the results of such studies are not\n\nactually being used to formulate industry plans and strategies, then\n\nthis would indicate the effectiveness of the program is far below\n\nits potential. To verify the use of government market identification\n\nmaterial would require a surveying of at least selected companies,\n\nboth within and out of the photovoltaic venture.\n\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nDATA\n\n\nAn indicator as to the progress on reducing prices and\n\nincreasing production volume could be extracted from an industry\xc2\xad\nsupported program involved in the collection of such data. Many\n\nindustries form industry associations. The purpose is to collect\n\nindustrywide type information as to prices, volumes, major trends,\n\nand to forecast future market sizes. The establishment of an\n\nindustry-supported organization could provide leading indicator data\n\nthat would show the rate at which prices were declining with accumu\xc2\xad\nlated volume and if any step function in prices occurred once new\n\ntechnologies were implemented within the industry. It would also\n\nptovide a background to measure the effectiveness of a newly imple\xc2\xad\nmented government incentive. This would provide an additional check\n\non the data provided through the market studies and reported data\n\nthrough the IRS tax forms if such were adopted.\n\n\n2\n\nGnostic Concepts, Inc.\n\n177\n\n5.4\n\nCONCLUDING\nSTATEMENTS\nINDICATORS\n\n\nON\n\nLEAD ING\n\n\nHigh-potential but low-risk market ventures soon evaporate..\n\nSince it is easy to make the decision to enter such a market, it\n\nconsequently attracts many investors early. The potential markets\n\nare absorbed by competing companies and the high potential is soon\n\ndissipated. High-potential and high-risk market ventures by their\n\nnature do not make decisions easy. Consequently, the attraction of\n\na large number of companies into these types of ventures is slow in\n\noccurrence. Even with the most aggressive incentive plans, it will\n\nstill be difficult to attract a large number of companies into such\n\ninvestment conditions. They must arrive at their own independent\n\ndecision through normal channels before the company\'s resources can\n\nbe justified for investment in such ventures.\n\nDecisions in industry for high-risk ventures are based on\n\njudgment, courage, and insight in the final analysis, none of which\n\nare truly measurable in quantitative values. As a consequence,\n\nvirtually no analytical perspective can be attached to the leading\n\nindicators that have been described above. Most cannot truly\n\nclassify as leading indicators because of the lack of their timely\n\ninsights. The quantitative measurement of these indicators is even\n\nmore difficult to support. Without a reliable and measurable set of\n\nleading indicators, the only approach that can be taken in applying\n\ngovernment incentives is to direct them toward the fundamentals of\n\nthe investment environment rather than the special conditions that\n\nmay exist at selected companies. Through applying fundamentally\n\nsound incentives directed at basic barriers, a far greater attraction\n\nof the best companies for the industrialization process will occur.\n\n\n178\n\n2\n\nCnostc Concepts, Inc\n\n6.Methodology\n6.1\n\nI N T R 0 D U C T I 0 N\n\n\nThis study was driven by the perceived need to know what\n\ninfluence government actions would have on the industrialization of\n\nthe photovoltaic industry. Identification of such information could\n\nbe used in formulating government actions to enhance and/or acceler\xc2\xad\nate the industrialization process. Without the understanding of the\n\ninvestment environment within the US industrial complex, it would be\n\neasy for government actions to be based on erroneous assumptions and\n\nbiased viewpoints. Through the establishment of the fundamental\n\ncharacteristics and elements that dominate an investment decision,\n\nthe proposed government actions can be tailored to provide assets\n\nand resources to account for the deficit areas within companies and\n\nat the same time not restrict or hinder the use of available\n\nstrengths and assets already well established.\n\nThe foundation and base position that allowed Gnostic Concepts\n\nto launch such an investigation was based upon:\n\n* Prior work in the field of photovoltaic market analysis\n\n* Longstanding interaction with the semiconductor industry\n\n* Relationships with executives, management, and other\n\npersonnel in major US corporations\n\nMany of the major efforts at Gnostic Concepts have been directed at\n\nunderstanding and developing strategic planning for corporations.\n\nAn extensive background in the collection of data permeates all the\n\nmajor activities at the company.\n\nThe company has concentrated on those areas where rapidly\n\nchanging technical or economic environments create needs for in-depth\n\nanalysis.

To add further insights into all aspects of the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic investment environment, firms having decided not to enter\n\nthe photovoltaic market were also interviewed. Additional companies\n\nconsidering entry into the photovoltaic field, as well as firms\n\nhaving never considered the photovoltaic venture as an option, were\n\nalso surveyed. This provided information concerning both the\n\npositive and negative acceptance of the photovoltaic venture, and\n\ninsights into companies that were marginal in their decision at the\n\npresent time. By marginal is meant that neither an acceptance nor a\n\nrejection of the photovoltaic venture had been firmly concluded.\n\nThe field survey work included a cross-section of various\n\nindustries, such as the petrochemical industry, electronic firms,\n\nequipment firms, materials companies, and conglomerates. The intent\n\nwas to determine the common denominators within each industry group\xc2\xad\ning as well as the diversity that may exist within each grouping.\n\nThe interviews covered a broad spectrum of various aspects of\n\neach company, including technical and production personnel. The\n\nmajor portion of the interviews, however, was directed at corporate\n\nexecutives involved in the decision-making process for investments.\n\nVenture analysis groups and selected staff members whose principal\n\nfunction was to investigate specific areas within new ventures were\n\nalso included. To obtain the required information, confidentiality\n\nhad to be guaranteed. Consequently, few company names are referenced\n\nwithin this report.

These\n\nrelated studies added great insight and a foundation upon which to\n\nbase further extensive interviews specifically designed for this\n\n\nF80\n\ncGnostc Concepts Inc\n\nstudy. These related studies also gave insights into the development\n\ntrends within many high-technology-based industries and markets.\n\nBecause of this background, the development trends within the photo\xc2\xad\nvoltaic industry could better be focused and viewed from a broad\n\nnumber of perspectives. A significant and broadly based comparison\n\nbackground was thus available, to which the major elements of the\n\nphotovoltaic industrialization process could be compared.\n\nA research of the publicly available written material was also\n\nperformed. This included annual reports, government-published data,\n\ntechnical journals, pertinent industry journals, news releases, and\n\npublic speeches given by company executives.\n\nDue to the many market studies performed in the electronic\n\nindustry, Gnostic Concepts has available an extensive set of inter\xc2\xad\nviews with company executives and a spectrum of many other corporate\n\npersonnel. Through these previous interviews, the necessary rela\xc2\xad\ntionships had already been established in many cases that allowed\n\nthe rapid and efficient execution of the needed interview programs\n\nfor this specific study. These new interviews, along with the\n\nprevious interview material, formed a significant portion of the\n\nbasis for the results and conclusions of this study.\n\n\nINTERACTION\n\nWITH\n\nJPL\n\nPERSONNEL\n\n\nBefore any extensive field work was begun, there were planning\n\nsessions with JPL personnel. The objective of these planning\n\nsessions was to establish very specific criteria for the content of\n\nthe report. A detailed outline of procedures was established that\n\nindicated companies to be interviewed, the spectrum of data to be\n\ncollected, the expected content, delivery date of all pertinent\n\ndocuments to JPL, and a thorough review of the intent of the study.\n\nTo pace the program and to provide interim milestone check\xc2\xad\npoints on the progress of the report, certain interim review meetings\n\nand interim reports were issued. Prior to these meetings and\n\nreports, there was interaction of JPL and Gnostic Concepts personnel\n\nto review the status, content, and quality of the material to be\n\npresented.\n\nOnce the fundamental information was gathered on the invest\xc2\xad\nment environment, activities within the project were then directed\n\nat the effect of available government actions upon the various iden\xc2\xad\ntified elements of the investment environment. The results of the\n\nliterature search, the field interview program, the available data\n\nfrom related studies and previous interviews, and the interfacing\n\nwith JPL personnel have all culminated in the issuing of this report.\n\n\nSGnostc Concepts, Inc.\n\n181\n\n7.
