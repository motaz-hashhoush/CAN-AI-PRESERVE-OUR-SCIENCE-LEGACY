INTRODUCTION\nThis paperdescribes of the hardwarendsoftware\nall\na\ninteractions operations\nand\nfortheSpaceechnology\nT\n5 (ST5) single-board\nflightcomputer. his computer, together\nT\nwith the software that runs on it, does much more than just\ncommand and data handling (C&DH),\nbut it is called the\nC&DH subsystem.\nIn order to put the C&DH design in\nperspective,\nthe paper starts with an overview of the ST-5\nmission and a review of the spacecraft technologies\nthat will\nbe flight validated by ST-5.\nFollowing\nthat, there is an\nintroduction to the spacecraft itself, with a discussion of the\nspacecraft\'s\nmechanical\ndesign and two-slot "card cage"\nthat houses the C&DH electronics\ncircuit card (or board)\nand the power system electronics circuit card (or board). A\nsummary of the key C&DH requirements\nleads into a more\nin-depth\npresentation\nof all the C&DH interfaces\nand\nfunctions, including how the electronics hardware and flight\nsoftware operations\nare partitioned\nin order to meet the\noverall requirements\nfor ST-5.\nThe details of the C&DH\nboard design are given in terms of the processor, memory,\ngate arrays, power conditioning,\nphysical dimensions\nand\nlayout.\nA description\nof the development,\nintegration and\ntest flow precedes\nthe paper\'s\nconclusion,\nand a list of\nacronyms appears at the end for easy cross-reference.\n\n2.\n\nST-5\n\nMISSION\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe Space Technology 5 mission is a part of NASA\'s New\nMillennium\nProgram (NMP).\nThe ST-5 project is an inhouse development\nmanaged\nat the Goddard Space Flight\nCenter in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nA primary goal of ST-5 is\nto provide\na proof-of-concept\ndemonstration\nfor future\nnano-satellite\nconstellation\nmissions.\nThe project will\naccomplish\nthis by developing\nand flying a satellite\nconstellation\ncomprised\nof three small, low-power,\nfullservice spacecraft,\neach with a total mass of about 25\nkilograms\n(kg). During the three-month\nmission, each of\nthe spacecraft will demonstrate\nseveral NMP nano-sat and\nconstellation-enabling\ntechnologies.\nMajor goals include\nshowing that multiple spacecraft can operate together as a\nsingle constellation\n(and not just a group of individual units)\nand showing that a very small spacecraft\nis capable of\nresearch-quality\nscience measurements.\nEach 25-kilogram\nspin-stabilized\nspacecraft\nhas a total\npower budget of approximately\n22 watts, which is provided\nby high-efficiency,\ntriple-junction\nsolar cell arrays and a\nlithium-ion\nbattery.\nThe three ST-5 spacecraft\nwill be\nlaunched\nas "secondary"\npayloads\ninto a highly elliptical\ngeo-synchronous\ntransfer orbit, with a period of about 10.5\nhours, a perigee distance of about 220 kilometers\nand an\napogee distance of about 38000 kilometers.\nAll three will\nshare the same orbit plane, and the separation\ndistance\nbetween spacecraft near apogee is expected to be between\n100 and 1000 kilometers.\nThe spacecraft spin rate will be\nabout 20 revolutions per minute (RPM).\n\n3.\n\nNEW\n\nMILLENNIUM\n\nPROGRAM\n\nTECHNOLOGIES\n\nThe purpose of NASA\'s\nNew Millennium\nProgram\nis to\ndevelop\nand flight validate\nthe critical\n"breakthrough"\ntechnologies\nthat are needed to enable the space science and\nEarth science\nmissions\nof the future.\nFor ST-5, the\nConstellation\nCommunication\nand Navigation\nTransceiver\n(CCNT) will enable intra-constellation,\nS-band cross-link\ncommunication\nof data and "science events" between the\nthree spacecraft.\nThe CCNT will also have a Global\nPositioning\nSystem receiver to allow orbit determination\nand inter-spacecraft\nranging measurements.\nThe CCNT will\nfulfill a part of the constellation\nobjective of the mission.\nAnother constellation\nenabling NMP technology\nis a set of\nautonomous\nground-based\nconstellation\nmanagement\nsoftware tools.\nThe other key technologies\nto be demonstrated\nby ST-5 are\nfocused\non the small, low-mass\nand low-power\ntheme.\nThese technologies\ninclude\na miniature\nand low-power\nX-band transponder\nfor uplink and downlink,\na cold gas\nmicro-thruster\n(CGMT)\npropulsion\nsystem, two variable\nemittance\ncontrollers\n(VEC) for the thermal\nsubsystem,\n"flex" harness interconnects\nfor the solar panels, and a new\ntype of I/2 volt CMOS ultra low-power,\nradiation-tolerant\n(CULPRIT)\nlogic.\nThe 1/2 volt CULPRIT\ntechnology,\nwhich is latchup immune\nand hardened\nfor up to 100\nkilorads\nof total ionization\ndose, will be verified\nas an\nintegral part of the C&DH subsystem.\n4.\n\nST-5\n\nSPACECRAFt\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nEach of the three spacecraft for the ST-5 mission will be\nidentical.\nEach spacecraft (S/C) is roughly a flat cylinder\nshape, approximately\n20 inches (51 centimeters)\nin diameter\nand 11 inches (28 centimeters)\ntall. The S/C mass budget is\naround 25 kg and the power budget is about 22 watts. The\nST-5 spacecraft\ndesign is composed\nof many subsystems,\nincluding\na science instrument\nand the small, low-power,\nlow-mass and constellation-enabling\nNMP technologies.\nCore spacecraft subsystems include a high efficiency power\nsystem,\na magnetically\nclean\nstructural\nand electrical\nsystem, a miniature\ndigital sun sensor (DSS), a compact\nlow-power flight computer with embedded flight software, a\nlightweight\nsmall volume mechanical\nstructure and an allpassive thermal control system\nThe science\ninstrument\nis a small,\nlow-power,\nhighresolution\nmagnetometer\n(MAG)\nthat will make in-situ\nmeasurements\nof the Earth\'s magnetic field throughout the\norbit.\nA deployable\nMAG\nboom\nwill position\nthe\nmagnetometer\'s\nsensor head about 1 meter away from the\ncenter of the S/C. ST-5 will perform science measurements\nfrom all three spacecraft in a way that validates the concept\nof operating\na constellation\nof spacecraft\nas a single\ninstrument\nplatform.\nThe spacecraft\nis capable of storing\n\noneorbit\'sworthof magnetometer Eachspacecraft antenna (not visible in Figure 1) is mounted to the outside of\ndata.\nprocesses\nitsmagnetometer inreal-time,\ndata\nandiscapable the top deck.\nof bothalerting\nother pacecraft\ns\ntothepresence science\nof\nevents,\nandreceiving tocollect\nalerts\nmagnetometer\nscience The CCNT, propulsion system gas tank, thruster control\nelectronics\n(TCE), two externally\naccessible\ndirect access\ndata\natahigh\nrate. The MAG data will also be used as part\nof a ground-based\nattitude determination\nalgorithm.\nThe\nhigh sensitivity\nof the MAG has been a significant design\ndriver, because magnetic materials\nand electrical\ncurrent\nflow topologies\ncan easily generate magnetic fields at the\nnano-Tesla\nlevel. This is especially\ntrue for a very small\nS/C where the magnetometer\'s\nsensor head cannot be placed\nat the end of a boom that is many meters long.\n4.1\n\nMechanical\n\nDesign\n\nThe basic shape of the ST-5 spacecraft is a right octagonal\nprism, or 8-sided flat "cylinder."\nThe spacecraft spin axis is\nthe axis of symmetry or axis of rotation of that "cylinder."\nThe top and bottom "decks" are octagons, and eight small\nsolar panels cover the outsides of the eight side walls of the\n"cylinder."\nA rectangular\n"brick\nshaped"\ncard cage\nenclosure mounts in between the two decks and joins the\ntwo decks together. The longest dimension of the card cage\nis slightly less than the diameter of the S/C.\nFigures\nI and 2 show the physical\nlayout for an ST-5\nvehicle. The battery, magnetometer\nelectronics,\ntransponder\nelectronics\nand radio frequency (RF) components,\nand one\nof the VEC boxes are mounted to the top deck as shown in\nFigure 1. This view is looking "up" toward components\non\nthe inside of the top deck, and "up" toward the empty\nrectangular\narea where the 2-slot card cage enclosure would\nattach to the top deck. The spacecraft X and Y coordinate\naxes are also shown in Figure 1. The transponder\'s\nX-band\n\ntest connectors,\n\nand\n\nanother\n\none\n\nof the\n\nVEC\n\nboxes\n\nmounted to the bottom deck as shown in Figure 2. This\nview is looking "down" toward components\non the inside of\nthe bottom deck, and "down" into the empty rectangular\nopening of the card cage enclosure box that is attached to\nthe bottom deck.\nIn Figure 2, the view (with respect to\nFigure 1) has been flipped about a horizontal\nline, so the X\naxis still points to the right, but now the Y axis points up. In\nFigure 2 the two card cage slots are parallel to the X axis,\nwith the planes of both circuit cards being normal to the\nspacecraft Y axis.\nIn Figure 2, the Power System Electronics\n(PSE) board will\nslide into the card cage slot nearest to the upper part of the\nfigure, and the C&DH board will go into the slot nearest to\nthe lower part of Figure 2. Since the card cage enclosure\nalmost bisects the usable inside volume of the spacecraft,\nthe CCNT, TCE and tank are referred to as being on the\n"PSE side" of the spacecraft.\nIn a similar fashion, the MAG\nelectronics\nand both of the VEC boxes are referred to as\nbeing on the "C&DH side" of the spacecraft.\nSide views of\nfive of the eight solar panels can be seen around the\nuppermost five sides of the octagons in Figures 1 and 2.\nThe CCNT\'s\ndeployable S-band antenna boom (not visible\nin Figure 2) is mounted to the outside of the bottom deck.\nNot shown in either figure is the deployable\nboom for the\nmagnetometer\'s\nsensor head.\nBoth booms are stowed or\n"folded" during launch and ascent, and then deployed after\nthe S/C is spun up to about 20 RPM as it separates from the\nlaunch vehicle.\n\nBottom Deck -Layo\n\ni\nFigure\n\n1: Bottom-Up\n\nView of Top Deck\n\nare\n\nFigure 2: Top-Down\n\nView of Bottom Deck\n\n4.2\n\nCard Cage with Backplane\n\nThe central card cage enclosure (roughly 46 x 24 x 11 cm)\nwill house two surface-mount\ncircuit board assemblies\nin\ntwo slots, one slot for the multi-function\nflight computer\n(called the C&DH board), and the other slot for the power\nsystem electronics\n(PSE) board.\nThis enclosure serves as\nthe major spacecraft\nstructural element connecting\nthe top\nand bottom decks, and also has a backplane for inter-board\ncommunications\nand external I/O expansion.\nThe card cage\nalso serves as the main heat conduction\npath from the\nC&DH and PSE boards out to the SIC structure.\nAll electrical\ninterfaces\nbetween\nthe PSE and C&DH,\nincluding those for: +5V power distribution\nfrom PSE to\nC&DH, digital signals to and from the PSE, and analog\nsignals from the PSE, will go through matching pairs of\nconnectors\non the backplane.\nFor both the C&DH board\nand the PSE board,\nsome\nof the power\nand signal\ninput/output\n(I/O) goes directly from connectors\non those\nboards. For S/C components\nand subsystems\non the C&DH\nside of the S/C, the power distribution\nis from the PSE\nboard, across the backplane,\nand "through"\nthe C&DH\nboard to the destination\nsubsystem.\nFor S/C components\nand subsystems\non the PSE side of the S/C, much (but not\nall) of the signal distribution\nis from the C&DH board,\nacross the backplane, and out to the destination\nsubsystem\nthrough a backplane\nI/O connector.\nThe reason for these\nrouting topologies\nwas to minimize\nthe magnetic\nfields\ngenerated\nby\nflowing\ncurrents;\nand\na system-level\nrequirement\nwas developed\nto have all power and signal\nwires to any given subsystem leave the card cage enclosure\nthrough a single connector.\nThere\nare two jumper-selectable\nsignals\n(bits) on the\nbackplane\nthat will be used to determine\nthe CCSDS\nspacecraft\nidentification\nfor each of the three members of\nthe ST-5 constellation.\nThese two signals (bits) will be\ndirectly readable by the X-band\ntransponder\nand by the\nC&DH flight software.\n4,3\n\nPower\n\nSystem Electronics\n\n(PSE)\n\nThe main functions of the power subsystem are to collect\nenergy from the eight solar array panels, store any excess\nsolar energy in the 9 ampere-hour\nlithium-ion battery, draw\nstored energy from that battery during periods of peak\npower demand (or during up to one hour of eclipse), and\nprovide switched power outputs (with on/off control) to a\nnumber of different S/C subsystems.\nThe PSE maintains an\nun-regulated\n+7.2 \xc2\xb1 1.2V power bus and a regulated +5V\npower bus. The PSE has switchable +5V regulated outputs\nfor the sun sensor, VEC #1, VEC #2 and the thruster control\nelectronics.\nIt also has switchable\n+7.2V un-regulated\noutputs for the magnetometer\nand MAG boom deployment\nactuator, the propulsion\nsystem\'s\ntank pressure sensor, the\nCCNT and its S-band antenna deployment\nactuator, and the\ntransponder\'s\nX-band downlink high power amplifier.\nAll\nof the switched power outputs have over-current\nprotection,\n\nwhere the trip level can be adjusted for each load.\nThe\n+7.2V power to the transponder\'s\nX-band uplink receiver is\nnot switchable\n(always left on).\nThe +5V power to the\nC&DH card is always left on, but can be cycled on-off-on\nby a ground-to-transponder\n"special command"\nif necessary.\nThe PSE has it own one-milliampere\ncurrent source for\npower\nsystem\nthermistors,\nand has a set of analog\nmultiplexers\nfor collecting power system signals that will be\ndigitized\non the C&DH board.\nThe PSE card switched\npower services and the collection of power system telemetry\nare controlled\nby C&DH processor read/write\ntransactions\nover the backplane\'s\nlocal 16-bit parallel data bus.\nEnergy balance will be maintained on a per orbit basis, and\nthe battery will be fully charged prior to eclipse entries. The\npower system\'s\nenergy balance and battery charge state\nalgorithms\nwill run on the C&DH processor.\nPeriods of\npeak power demand\nare expected\nto be during X-band\ndownlink passes and when the CCNT is being validated.\nNote that the ST-5 spacecraft is NOT powered on during\nlaunch and ascent, and that a key function of the PSE is to\nsense physical\nseparation\nfrom the launch vehicle\nand\nautonomously\nturn on the S/C.\nThe PSE provides\nan\nexternally\naccessible\ntest connector\nfor supplying\nground\npower, charging\nthe battery, and directly measuring\nthe\npower system\'s health and status signals.\n\n5.\nFigure\ncenter\n\nC&DH\n\nBOARD\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n3 is a block diagram\nof the ST-5 architecture,\n\nSUMMARY\n\nshowing the C&DH at the\nwith interfaces to all other\n\nsubsystems.\nThe C&DH provides the micro-processor\nand\nmemory required to do the command and control, telemetry,\ndata collection,\ndata storage, and on-board processing\nfor\nalmost the entire spacecraft.\nThe C&DH interfaces to the\npower system electronics,\nmagnetometer,\ndigital sun sensor,\nvariable\nemittance\ncontrollers,\nCCNT,\ncold gas microthruster, tank pressure transducer,\nX-band transponder\nand\nvarious thermistors\nas described in Section 6.\nThe C&DH command uplink and telemetry downlink paths\nare CCSDS compliant. They support a 1 kilobit per second\n(kbps) uplink command rate and a downlink telemetry rate\nthat is selectable\nto be either 1 kbps or 100 kbps. Uplink\ncodeblock\nerror\ndetection\nand\nde-randomization\nare\nperformed\non ground-to-spacecraft\ncommand\nframes.\nOn\nthe downlink path, cyclic redundancy\ncheck (CRC), ReedSolomon\nencoding,\npseudo-randomization\nand V, rate\nconvolutional\nencoding is performed on all telemetry frames\nas they are sent to the transponder for communication\nto the\nground.\nThe C&DH\'s\non-board solid state recorder (SSR) memory\nhas error detection and correction (EDAC) and has a usable\ncapacity\nof 15 megabytes.\nThe plan is to downlink the\ncontents of the SSR during a 20-30 minute ground station\npass at 100 kbps.

There will be an externally\naccessible\nC&DH direct access test connector\nfor memory\nloading,\nhard-line (baseband) serial uplink and downlink, etc.\n\n6.\n\n6.1\n\nC&DH\n\nINTERFACES\n\nPower System Electronics\n\nAND FUNCTIONS\n\n(PSE) Interface\n\nThe PSE provides\nregulated\n+5V power to the C&DH\nthrough a backplane connector.\nThis power is normally on\nwhenever the spacecraft is powered, except that the C&DH\npower can be momentarily\ncycled on-off-on by a hardware\nspecial\ncommand\nsignal\nthat\ngoes directly\nfrom the\ntransponder\nto the PSE.\nAll flight software\n(FSW)\ncontrol\nand monitoring\nof\nswitched power services are done by digital data transfers\nbetween the PSE and the C&DH over a 16-bit parallel bus\non the backplane.\nThe FSW will write to and read from a\nswitched service register on the PSE card in order to turn\npower services on and off, where there is one bit in that\nregister\nfor control of each switched\nservice.\nDue to\nmagnetics\nrequirements,\nthe PSE switched power services\nthat go to subsystems on the "C&DH side" of the spacecraft\nactually flow over the backplane\nand "through" the C&DH\nboard. This applies to the +5V power to VEC1 and VEC2,\nand the +7.2V power to the MAG boom actuator and the\nMAG electronics.\nThe PSE provides dedicated analog signals to C&DH that\nare used to measure bus voltage, bus/load current, battery\nvoltage and battery current. The PSE also has a multiplexed\nanalog output signal to C&DH that is used to monitor solar\narray voltage, solar array current, battery half-voltages,\nPSE\n+5V supply voltage, battery cell temperatures,\nsolar array\ntemperatures,\nand PSE board temperature.\nFor this\nmultiplexed\nanalog signal, the C&DH drives the multiplexer\nchannel select signals to the PSE over the backplane.\nFor\nmore details on analog telemetry collection, see Section 6.9.\n6.2\n\nMagnetometer\n\n(MAG)\n\nInterface\n\nThe magnetometer\nsenses magnetic\nfield strength\nand\npolarity along three nominally\northogonal\naxes. The sign\nand magnitude\nof the field for each of the three axes is\ndigitized to 17 bits.\nThe range of field values that can be\nsensed,\nalong with the resolution\nof the field strength\nvalues, is controlled by a MAG range select signal (bit) that\ngoes from C&DH to MAG. When the range is set for low\nresolution,\nthe MAG can sense fields from approximately\none nano-Tesla (1 nT) up to about + 64000 nT. When set\nfor high resolution,\nthe MAG can sense fields from\napproximately\n0.1 nT up to about\n+ 1000 nT. FSW can\nchange the MAG range select bit in response\nto a field\nstrength change or a science event warning as required.\nThe MAG transmits\nits data on a synchronous\nserial\ninterface\nto the C&DH, with a total of 52 bits for each\nsample of the magnetic vector field. There are 17 bits for\neach\nof the\nthree\naxes,\nand\n1 bit for the MAG\n\nrange/sensitivity\nsetting.\nThe 52-bit MAG "vectors" are\ngenerated at a regular 16 Hz rate (every 62.5 milliseconds)\nbased on an oscillator inside the MAG electronics.\nC&DH\nhardware will do the serial-to-parallel\nconversion\nand timetagging required for FSW to read and process the data from\nMAG.\nThe "time-tag"\nfor each 52-bit MAG vector will\nconsist of a seconds count and a sub-seconds count, accurate\nto 0.25 milliseconds.\nEach time-tagged\nMAG vector will\nrequire 16 bytes of memory.\nThe C&DH\'s\nSRAM buffering\nconcept\nwill accumulate\nsixteen\ntime-tagged\nMAG vectors at a time, and then\ninterrupt FSW at a 1 Hz rate.\nTwo MAG data receive\nbuffers in SRAM will be written into and read out by flight\nsoftware (FSW) in a "ping-pong"\narrangement.\nWhen FSW\nreads out the 256 bytes of time-tagged\nMAG vector data\nevery second, it will then process that data for a science\nevent (SE) and store it on the solid state recorder.\nFlow\ncontrol is implemented\nat the receiving end, where FSW can\nenable or disable the flow of MAG vector data into the\nSRAM buffers.\nThe C&DH can collect and digitize analog telemetry for\nMAG total current, MAG electronics temperature and MAG\nsensor head temperature as described in Section 6.9.\n\n6.3\n\nDigital Sun Sensor\n\n(DSS) Interface\n\nAs the ST-5 spacecraft\nrotates at approximately\n20 RPM,\nthe Sun will pass through the field-of-view\nof the digital sun\nsensor (DSS) every 3 seconds.\nWhen this occurs, the DSS\nwill generate a pulse that will cause the C&DH hardware to\nsample the sub-seconds\ncount, and latch the eleven (11) bits\nof sun elevation\nangle data from the DSS.\nThe C&DH\nhardware will then interrupt the flight software to signal that\na new time-tagged\nmeasurement\nof elevation\nangle is\navailable.\nAll of the time-tag and elevation data will be held\nin registers\nuntil the next DSS pulse, so FSW will be\nrequired to service the DSS elevation\ndata interrupt (by\nreading that data) within about 3 seconds.\nThe C&DH can\ncollect and digitize analog telemetry\nfor DSS electronics\ntemperature as described in Section 6.9.\n\n6.4\n\nVariable Emittance\nInterfaces\n\nController\n\n(VEC1 and VEC2)\n\nFor each of the two VECs, FSW will be able to set or clear\ntwo control bits to the VEC and read a status bit from the\nVEC.\nOne control bit will set VEC mode to automatic or\nmanual.\nIn automatic\nmode, the VEC will adjust its\nemittance\nas necessary\nto regulate temperature\naround a\nfixed set-point.\nIn manual mode, the second control bit will\nset the VEC to a low emittance state or a high emittance\nstate. The status bit will confirm that VEC power is on, that\nthe VEC\'s self-test passed, and that the VEC\'s multiplexed\nanalog telemetry output signal is valid.\n\nRegardlesswhether\nof\neither ECis onor off, theC&DH\nV\nwill be ableto collect nddigitizeanalog\na\ntelemetry\nfrom\ntwothermistors each\nfor\nVECasdescribed Section.9.\nin\n6\nIn addition these\nto\nfour thermistors, VEChasan\neach\nactive\nanalog\noutputhatis internally time-multiplexed to\nt\nmake sixteen different\nanalog measurements\nfrom inside\nthat VEC.\nThere is an analog channel select clock signal\nfrom C&DH (one for VEC1 and another for VEC2) that will\nselect which of the sixteen internal analog signals will\nappear at the VEC\'s multiplexed\nanalog output. The C&DH\nhardware\nwill\nsupport\nan\n"automatic"\nprocess\nto\nsequentially\nselect each of the sixteen analog channels and\ndigitize that channel\'s\nsignal.\nFSW will only have to\ninitiate this automatic process, and when hardware has done\nall sixteen analog-to-digital\nconversions,\nand stored all\nsixteen bytes of digitized data in the SRAM, it will interrupt\nFSW to signal that the VEC analog data is ready to read\nfrom SRAM.\n\n6.5\n\nConstellation\nCommunication\nTransceiver (CCNT) Interface\n\nThe\n\nmain\n\nflow\n\nof information\n\n& Navigation\n\nbetween\n\nthe C&DH\n\nand\n\nCCNT will be in the form of N-byte message packets over a\nfull-duplex,\n38.4 kbaud asynchronous\nserial data link. All\nmessage bytes will be sent in a 10-bit "frame," with one\nstart bit and one stop bit. The bytes in each message will be\nformatted according to the JPL-developed\nBlackJack\nData\nLink Protocol.\nThe transmission\nof BlackJack\n(B J) message packets from\nC&DH to CCNT will be controlled by FSW pre-loading any\none of eight CCNT transmit buffers (in the SRAM) that\ndefines the size of the transmit message and the bytes to be\nsent.\nAfter pre-loading\na transmit buffer, FSW will only\nhave to write to a transmit start address to command\nthe\nhardware to initiate and complete the message transmission.\nThe FSW will then be able to do other tasks like GN&C\ncomputations,\noutgoing\nBJ\n\nMAG\nbytes\n\ndata\nare\n\nprocessing,\nserialized\n\netc.,\nand\n\nwhile\nthe\ntransmitted\n\nautomatically\nunder FPGA control.\nWhen each BJ message\ntransmission\nprocess completes,\nthe C&DH hardware will\nset a CCNT transmit done interrupt bit.\nThe types, sizes and rates for BlackJack\nmessage packets\nfrom CCNT to C&DH will vary as required for different\nmodes of CCNT operation.\nA series of CCNT receive\nbuffers (in the SRAM) will be used to regulate the flow of\nBJ message\ndata from the CCNT, and thereby\ngreatly\nreduce the frequency\nof interrupts\nrequired\nfor FSW to\nreceive and store the CCNT messages. The CCNT receive\nbuffers will each hold 256 bytes.\nEach time that one of\nthese buffers fills, the C&DH hardware will notify FSW and\nthe next receive buffer will start filling.\nThere will be\nthirty-two\n(32) receive buffers\nin the SRAM, and these\nbuffers will be arranged\nin a "circular\nqueue" structure\nwhere the buffers always fill in the order 0, 1, 2...29, 30, 31,\n0, 1, etc. In a sense, this 32 x 256 allocation of SRAM will\n\nbe set up like an 8-kilobyte\nFIFO.\nThe C&DH hardware\nwill maintain\nreadable\ncounters\nto keep track of which\nreceive buffer is actively being filled, how many unread\nreceive buffers still need to be read out, and which receive\nbuffer holds the oldest unread data. Having multiple CCNT\nreceive buffers (which can be read out individually\nor in\ngroups and at any time) will provide a very flexible design\nwith low FSW overhead.\nThe only constraint\nis that the\nflight software must keep up with the average rate of data\nflow from the CCNT.\nVery large BJ messages to or from\nCCNT will be able to "span" multiple transmit or receive\nbuffers (if necessary).\nFlow control will be implemented\nat\nthe receiving end for packet transfers in both directions.\nWhen the local C&DH processor "detects"\na science event\nthrough real-time analysis of MAG vector data, it will send\na science event warning (SEW) to the local CCNT as a BJ\nserial message packet (see above).\nThe local CCNT will\nthen pass this science\nevent warning\non to the other\nmembers\nof the constellation\nover the S-band cross-link.\nWhen the local CCNT receives a science event warning\nmessage over the S-band cross-link from a remote CCNT in\none of the other spacecraft\nin the constellation,\nthe local\nCCNT will generate a pulse on a discrete signal line to the\nlocal C&DH. When the C&DH hardware detects this pulse,\nit will latch the seconds count, latch the sub-seconds\ncount,\nand interrupt FSW to signal that a SEW has been received.\nThe incoming science event warning was implemented\nas a\ndiscrete signal because the FSW does NOT interpret (but\nonly stores) BlackJack messages from the CCNT.\nThe C&DH can sense the CCNT total current and S-band\npower amplifier temperature as described in Section 6.9.\n\n6.6\n\nPropulsion\nInterfaces\n\nSystem\n\n(Tank, Pressure\n\nSensor,\n\nThruster)\n\nThe ST-5 spacecraft\nwill have a single-thruster\n"cold gas"\npropulsion\nsystem in order to initially\norient and then\nmaintain the S/C spin axis with respect to the sun line and\nthe ecliptic plane.\nThe interfaces to the propulsion system\nwill provide\nfor on-off control and validation of the New\nMillennium\ntechnology\ncold gas micro-thruster\n(CGMT),\nand for collection\nof analog telemetry from the gas tank,\nthruster and thruster control electronics.\nThe times of thruster on-off control pulses can be phased\nwith respect to the rotation of the spacecraft (via the 0.33 Hz\nsun sensor output pulses) or with respect to a 2 Hz clock\nthat is derived from the spacecraft\'s\nmission elapsed timer.\nFor either of these two thruster pulse "phasing modes," the\nFSW will write to a thruster pulse delay register and a\nthruster pulse width/duration\nregister.\nBoth programmable\nregisters are set up as down-counters.\nThe 2 Hz phasing\nmode will be used for spacecraft\nA-V maneuvers,\nand the\nDSS phasing mode will be used for initial sun acquisition\nand sun-precession\nmaneuvers.\n\nThepulse\ndelay\nregister\nresolution 1 millisecond,\nis\nandit\nsets\ntheamount timebetween\nof\ntheDSS\npulse (or2\nedge\nHzclock\npulse\nedge) thethruster open\nand\nvalve pulse. he\nT\nmaximum\npulse\ndelayis 8192milliseconds theDSS\nfor\npulse\nphasing\nmode, nd499milliseconds the2 Hz\na\nfor\npulse hasing\np\nmode.\n\nwill go from the transponder\nto the PSE in order to cycle the\nC&DH\npower\non-off-on\nand reset\nthe Mongoose\n5\nprocessor.\nThe transponder\nsupports analog signals to and\nfrom the C&DH that are used to measure HPA temperature\nand crystal oscillator temperature,\nand sense the automatic\ngain control setting, carrier loop stress, and RF power level.\nPlease see Section 6.9.\n\nThepulse\nduration\nregisteresolution 50 milliseconds,\nr\nis\nand setsheamount\nit\nt\noftimethatthethruster\nisactuallyn 6.8\no\nand\nfiring.Thisis thesamesthetime\na\nbetween thruster\nthe\nvalve\nopen\npulse\nandthethruster\nvalve\nclose\npulse.The\nThe\npulse duration can be integer multiples of 50 milliseconds\nover the range from 50 to 450 milliseconds,\nwith a special\nfeature for leaving the thruster "on continuously"\nfor the\nlarger integer multiples such as 500, 550, 600, etc.\nThe C&DH can measure tank temperature,\ntank pressure\nand\ntank\npressure-temperature\ncalibration,\nCGMT\ntemperature and TCE temperature.\nPlease see Section 6.9.\n6.7\n\nX-band\n\nTransponder\n\nInterface\n\nThe C&DH supports electrical\ninterfaces\nto the X-band\ntransponder\nfor uplink and downlink\nwith the ground\nstation, for control and monitoring of the internal operation\nof the transponder,\nand for sensing temperatures\nand other\nanalog parameters that are inside the transponder.\nThe 64-bit CCSDS uplink command codeblocks\nare verified\nand stored by C&DH hardware\nas they arrive from the\nground and through\nthe transponder\nover a synchronous\nserial interface at 1 kbps. Flight software will be interrupted\nfor the arrival of each uplink codeblock.\nST-5 mission\noperations planning calls for one X-band downlink pass (20\nto 30 minutes at either 1 kbps or 100 kbps) for each 10.5\nhour orbit. The C&DH solid-state recorder (SSR) will store\nall of the spacecraft science data and health/status\ntelemetry\ncollected during that orbit, as a series of CCSDS-formatted\nVirtual Channel Data Units (VCDU).\nThe C&DH design\nwill provide a 1024 x 32 bit FIFO for rate buffering the\ndownlink data as it flows from the SSR to the FIFO (where\nwhole VCDUs are transferred\nunder FSW control).\nThe\nC&DH hardware then pulls 32-bit words from the FIFO and\nprepares them for synchronous\nserial baseband transmission\nto the transponder.\nThe hardware will add a CRC checksum\nand the Reed-Solomon\ncheck symbols to the FIFO data, and\ndo rate \xc2\xbd convolutional\nencoding\non the data as it is\nserialized.\nAs the serial stream is sent through\nthe\ntransponder,\nit is up-converted\nto X-band for transmission\nfrom the transponder\nto the ground.\nThe C&DH\nsynchronous\ncontrol words\nand allow\n\nand transponder\nwill have separate\n1 kbps\nserial data links to allow 16-bit command and\nto be sent from the C&DH to the transponder\n16-bit status\nwords\nto be sent from the\n\ntransponder\nto the C&DH.\nThe command interface will be\nused to control the internal configuration\nof the transponder\nand set the downlink\nbit rate to 100 kbps or 1 kbps.\nA\ntransponder\nhardware-decoded\n"special command"\nsignal\n\nCULPRiT\n\nLogic Technology\n\nlnterface\n\nCMOS ultra low-power\nradiation-tolerant\n(CULPRIT)\nlogic technology\nwill be validated\nin a Reed-Solomon\nencoder that is part of the telemetry downlink path.\nThe\nCULPRIT\nencoder\ncan be selected\nby a multiplexer\nto\nreplace\na standard\nReed-Solomon\nencoder\nthat\nis\nimplemented\nin a conventional\n+5V CMOS logic process.\nThe CULPRIT\nlogic process\nlowers\ntransistor\nturn-on\nthresholds\nto on the order of a tenth of a volt, so that the\nCULPRIT\nsupply voltage can be as low as +0.5V.\nThis\nalone could lower dynamic power dissipation\nfor CULPRIT\nparts by a factor of 100. Control of positive and negative\nanalog bias voltages is then applied to adjust the switching\nthresholds for process variations.\nThis bias control will be\ndone with a 10 kHz pulse-width\nmodulated\ndigital signal in\nconjunction\nwith an analog\nlow-pass\nfilter.\nPower\nconsumption\nmeasurements\nwill be made by sensing current\nfrom the +0.5V supply.\n6.9 Analog\n\nTelemetry\n\nCollection\n\nInterface\n\nAnalog telemetry includes all of the analog voltage, current,\nand temperature\n(thermistor)\nsignals that are collected and\ndigitized from many different subsystems and from all over\nthe spacecraft.\nA number of analog telemetry measurements\nhave already been mentioned\nfor the PSE, MAG, DSS,\nVEC1 and VEC2, CCNT, propulsion\nsystem, transponder\nand CULPRIT logic technology.\nIn addition to these, the\nC&DH board monitors voltage and/or current for its onboard supply regulators (+3.3V, +2.5V and +0.5V), and for\nthe CULPRIT\nbias voltages.\nAlso monitored\nare the\ntemperatures\nfor the C&DH crystal oscillator, the spacecraft\ntop and bottom decks, the card cage side walls and the\nnutation damper.\nTwo l-milliampere\ncurrent sources (one\non the PSE board and one on the C&DH board) will be used\nto generate voltages across thermistors.\nThe other analog\ntelemetry signals will be actively driven at the source.\nTo sample and digitize the telemetry signal from any one of\nthe analog sources (thermistors\nor active signals), there will\nbe analog multiplexers\non the C&DH card, and analog\nmultiplexers\non the PSE card. All of these multiplexers\nwill\nfunnel down to the input of a single 8-bit analog-to-digital\nconverter (ADC) on the C&DH card, and this ADC will be\nused to digitize all of the analog signals on the spacecraft.\nEach analog telemetry\nsignal, regardless\nof whether that\nchannel is a thermistor\nor voltage or current, will have a\nunique 8-bit analog channel number (ACN) that defines the\nsetting of analog multiplexer\nswitches required to route that\nanalog signal to the input of the ADC.\n\nAn automatic\nanalogtelemetry\ncollectionmodewill\nsignificantly\noffload\ntheprocessor fromhaving\nFSW\ntodo\nall thelow-level\nmicro-operations\nlike:writing\neach\nsetof\nanalog ultiplexer\nm\nchannel\nselect its(samestheACN),\nb\na\nwaitingfor theanalog\nsignal hainto settle, tarting\nc\ns\nthe\nanalog-to-digital\nconversion,\nwaitingfor the analog-todigital onversion\nc\ntocomplete, then\nand reading\nthe8bitsof\ndigitized ata.Forthisautomatic FSW pre-load\nd\nmode, will\nanyoneof sixteennalog\na\ncollectionontrolablesin the\nc\nt\n(\nSRAM)thatdefines:henumber f analog\nt\no\nchannels\nto\ndigitize, hichchannels digitize, ndwhatorderto\nw\nto\na\ndigitize in.\nthem\n\ndesign also has a DRAM refresh controller,\ntwo general\npurpose 32-bit counters, a number of external interrupt pins,\ntwo full-duplex\nuniversal asynchronous\nreceiver transmitter\n(UART) ports, and built-in Hamming\ncode EDAC for 32-bit\ntransactions\non the memory bus.\nMemory\ntypes include\nelectrically\nerasable\nprogrammable\nread-only\nmemory\n(EEPROM),\ndynamic random access memory (DRAM) and\nstatic random access memory (SRAM).\nThe M5 processor was selected because of its reliability and\nrecent familiarity from the Earth Observer-I\n(EO-1) mission\nlaunched in November 2000 and the Microwave\nAnisotropy\nProbe (MAP) mission launched in June 2001.

The FPGA\nwill then read 32-bit words from the FIFO, and perform the\noperations\njust described.\nOne RS encoder\nwill be\nimplemented\nin a standard +5V CMOS logic process.\nThe\nCULPRIT +0.5 volt logic technology\nwill be validated in a\nsecond RS encoder.\nThe downlink portion of the FPGA\nwill be able to select between either of the two RS encoders.\nInstrument\n\nFPGA--The\n\nInstrument\n\nFPGA\n\nwill control:\n\nthe\n\ncollection of serial digital data from the MAG and CCNT,\nthe transmission\nof serial data to the CCNT,\nand the\ncollection\nof analog\ntelemetry\ndata from all over the\nspacecraft.\nThis FPGA\nwill also contain\nthe DMA\ncontroller that will be used to access the SRAM buffers, and\nthe I/O interfaces for the two VECs.\nThe collection and\ntime-tagging\n\nand buffering\n\nof MAG\n\nscience\n\ndata will be per\n\n6.2.\n\nThe\n\ntransmit\n\nand\n\nreceive\n\ninterfaces\n\nfor\n\nBlackjack\nmessages to and from the CCNT were covered in\nsection 6.5. The automatic\nanalog data collection\nwill be\ntable-driven\nas described in section 6.9.\n7.3\n\nFlight Software\n\nInterrupts\n\nThere are a number of different events that can potentially\ninterrupt\nthe M5 processor\'s\nexecution\nof the flight\nsoftware.\nFor each event that can interrupt the processor,\nthere is a readable bit in an interrupt status register.\nMany\n(but not all) of the interrupts are "maskable,"\nand for each\nbit in the interrupt status register there is a corresponding\nbit\nin an interrupt mask register.\nAs each event occurs, if the\nmask bit for that interrupt is 1, then FSW will be interrupted\nimmediately.\nOtherwise\nFSW can poll the interrupt status\nregister to see if that event occurred.\nSome of the interrupt\nevents include:\nuplink codeblock\nready, downlink\nFIFO\nneeds data, EDAC error status, sun sensor elevation data\navailable,\nthruster pulse complete,\nMAG data buffer full,\nCCNT receive buffer full, CCNT message transmit done,\nscience event warning received from CCNT, S/C analog\ntelemetry collection\ndone, and analog telemetry data ready\nfor either VEC1 or VEC2.\n7.4\n\nPower Distribution\n\nand Mechanical\n\nThe PSE will provide +5.0V power to the C&DH, and\nregulators on the C&DH board will then derive the +3.3V,\n+2.5V and +0.5 volt supplies required by the various C&DH\ncomponents.\nThe M5 processor,\nEEPROM,\nFIFO, FPGAs\nand standard Reed-Solomon\nencoder use the +5V supply.\nThe DRAM uses the +3.3V supply, and only the FPGAs\nneed the +2.5V supply.\nThe CULPRIT\ndevice uses the\n+0.5V supply.\nThe first voltage\nregulator\nwill convert\n+5.0V down to +3.3V.\nA second regulator\nwill downconvert from +5.0V to +2.5V, and a third regulator will take\nthe +5.0V down to +0.5V.\nTelemetry\nfor voltage level and\ncurrent draw will be provided for each regulator output.\nThe complete C&DH board assembly will be composed of\ntwo surface-mount\nprinted circuit boards that are populated\nwith electronic\ncomponents\non one side only.\nThe two\ncircuit boards (referred\nto as side A and side B for the\ncomplete\nassembly)\nare then laminated\nto a central\naluminum heatsink.\nCross-connections\nbetween the A side\nand B side are implemented\nthrough the use of "z-wires."\nFigures 5 and 6 show a preliminary\nlayout concept for the A\nand B sides of the C&DH board assembly, with dimensions\nin inches.\nThe 0.5 inch wide strip along the top edges of\nboth sides is reserved for external I/O connectors.\nThe two\nbackplane\nconnectors\n(a l l0-pin and a 164-pin) will be\nmounted along the bottom edges of the two circuit boards.\nThe two round holes along the long dimension ceriterline of\nthe circuit boards are for "stiffener\nrods" that will fix the\nheatsink with respect to the card cage side walls. In Figures\n5 and 6, it is worth noting that the z-wires, decoupling\ncapacitors, and transient voltage suppressors\nare not shown.\nIn other words, this will be a very dense board.\n\nSide,+,\n8888"\n8.375"\n\n\'1624+\n\nn\n\nM.,oos\xc2\xa9\n\nLP\n\nEEPROM\n-]\n\nEEPROM\n\nO+2"\n\n\'157\n\n\' 16_14\nr._.l\n\nI\n\n+\n\n5 V to 3.3 V\n\nI-+-_ F--I=++_I.\xc2\xb0\nn\nli\n\nI\n\nPOWER\nO\n\nL____J\n\nOP-AMP\n_\n\n[]\n[]\n\nREGU\n\no =\'u\n@ _.,\nII\nu\n\nII\nu\n\nREGULATOIt\n,Vlo25v\nL.-..I\nL_TOR\n\nHesder,\n\n..d.,..+m+,.

And to reduce the possibility\nof noise\nproblems for the +0.5V logic signals, the CULPRIT encoder\n(on B side of board) will be kept away from the high-speed\n+5V logic (on A side of board).\nThe very aggressive\ndevelopment,\nintegration\nand test plan\nwill be another\nformidable\nchallenge.\nThis plan may\nrequire simultaneous\nsupport from a small team of C&DH\npersonnel\nat the breadboard,\nflight unit, card cage and\nspacecraft level, while three parallel S/C development\nflows\nproceed in a staggered but overlapping\nsequence.\nTo save\ntime and allow for parallel efforts, a significant\namount of\ndesign and interface\ndocumentation\nwill be prepared\nup\nfront.\nThis should\nhelp to enable\nthe simultaneous\ndevelopment\nof flight software, ground support equipment\nand flight hardware.\nIn addition,\nall of the external\nelectrical\ninterfaces\nare identical for the breadboards\nand\nflight units, so that integration\nand test procedures\nthat are\ndebugged\nduring\nbreadboard\nintegration\nwith support\nequipment\nsimulators can be reused again and again during\nflight unit integrations\non spacecraft #1, #2 and #3.\n\n10,CONCLUSION\nA compact,\nlow-power,\nmulti-function\nflight computer\nis\nbeing\ndesigned\natNASA\'s\nGoddard\nSpacelightCenter\nF\nto\nmeethestringent\nt\nrequirementsa technology\nof\nvalidation\nandnano-sat\nconstellation\ntrailblazer ission.
