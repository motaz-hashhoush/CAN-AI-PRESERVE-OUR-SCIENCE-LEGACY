Spills of fuels and other liquids often result in considerable fire hazards, and much remains unknown about the details of how a flame, once ignited, moves across a pool. The depth of the liquid or size of the spill, the temperature, and wind, if any, can all complicate the combustion processes. In addition, with the advent of the International Space Station there may be fire hazards associated with cleaning, laboratory, or other fluids in space, and it is essential to understand the role that gravity plays in such situations. The Spread Across Liquids (SAL) experiment is an experimental and computational effort dedicated to understanding the detailed mechanisms of flame spread across a flammable liquid initially below its flashpoint temperature. The experimental research is being carried out in-house by a team of researchers from Glenn, the National Center for Microgravity Combustion, and Zin Technologies, with computer modeling being provided via a grant with the University of California, Irvine. Glenn's Zero Gravity Facility is used to achieve short microgravity periods, and normal gravity testing is done in the Space Experiments Laboratory. To achieve longer periods of microgravity, the showcase SAL hardware flies aboard a sounding rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, approximately once per year. In addition to extended microgravity, this carrier allows the use of detailed diagnostics that cannot be employed in a drop tower.", "title": "Spread Across Liquids Continues to Fly", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T10:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050199447, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Miller, Fletcher J."}, "organization": {"name": "National Center for Microgravity Research on Fluids and Combustion", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "f940c3333538415ea1ecd2684d0c5aa5"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050199447, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050199447, "id": "2f0b1e724bcd4fb59ccf69214ec991ba", "publicationName": "Research and Technology 2000", "publicationDate": "2001-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050199447.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050199447/downloads/20050199447.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050199447/downloads/20050199447.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050199447/downloads/20050199447.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
