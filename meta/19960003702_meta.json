Linewidths as narrow as 1 km/s can be expected from such regions, and so the spectrometer is designed with sub-km/s resolution so that observed line profiles will be resolved. Since its debut on the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) in 1985, the instrument has been used in regular annual flight programs from both Moffett Field, CA and Christchurch, NZ. The basic plan of the spectrometer remains unchanged from the original design presented at the previous airborne science symposium. Numerous improvements and updates to the technical capability have of course been included over the many years of operational service.", "title": "Far-infrared heterodyne spectrometer", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960003702, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Boreiko, Rita T."}, "organization": {"name": "Colorado Univ.", "location": "Boulder, CO, United States"}}, "id": "e477d1e05c6141d7acde7072372bb8d3"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19960003702, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Betz, Al L."}, "organization": {"name": "Colorado Univ.", "location": "Boulder, CO, United States"}}, "id": "409427ad5b5e4d159c2dc6e77494ad79"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960003702, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960003702, "id": "c737567266414067a697f70acc44a438", "publicationName": "Astronomical Society of the Pacific, Airborne Astronomy Symposium on the Galactic Ecosystem: From Gas to Stars to Dust, Volume 73", "publicationDate": "1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
