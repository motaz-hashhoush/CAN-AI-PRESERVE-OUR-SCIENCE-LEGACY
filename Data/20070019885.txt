b'A space-age house demonstrates\nhow advanced technology can cat bome fuel\nconslrmption by two-thirds and water asage\nby half, while providing bonuses in\nconvenience and safety.\n\nthat NASA built\n\n"\n\na\n\n2\n\n.\n\n-\n\nYou are thinking of buying a home and, perhaps\neven more than the purchase price, you\'re concerned about the monthly outlay, the mortgage\npayment plus the utility bill. You know utility costs\nare climbing about 10 percent a year. Even water,\nonce a small item in the homeowner\'s budget, is\nmore expensive. In the not-too-distant future it\'s\npossible utility costs will exceed mortgage payments.\nAs a homeowner, how would you like to be\nrelatively independent of rising utility costs, \'and\ndraw instead on nature\'s bounty for a significant part\nof your energy needs?Or, to put it another way, how\nwould you like a house whose special design and\nother features could save you over $20,000 in utility\nsavings over a 20-year period and at the same time\noffer a variety of innovations that add up t o greater\ncomfort, convenience, security, and fire safety?\nSuch a house already exists. It\'s still i n the demonstration stage, but all of its equipment and design\nfeatures are now available to the public or will be\nwithin only a few years. Most of the systems evolved\n0\nfrom some aspect of the space program. Each was 4\nselected to fit one of the guideline categories:\nmoney savings, safety, or comfort.\nThe home i s called The Energy Conservation\nHouse (Tech) and it i s located at NASA\'s Langley\nResearch Center in Virginia. Tech House incorporates NASA technology, the latest commercial building techniques and other innovations, all integrated \'\ninto a super-efficient home that offers exceptional\nsavings to the individual family and potentially great\nnational benefit in resource conservation.\nStarting this year it is planned that a family will\nlive in the home for a year while NASA engineers\nmonitor the new systems and put together a record\nof day-to-day performance. NASA officials believe\nthe Tech House concept may influence near-term\ndevelopments in home construction by pointing up\nthe many benefits space-age technology offers.\n\nTech House is a contemporary, one-story, threebedroom home which could be available commercially within five years for $45,000 to $50,000 (in\ntoday\'s dollars), a price range once in the luxury class\nbut now close to the average. It has a large living\nroom with a fireplace, dining area, kitchen, three\nbedrooms, two baths, laundry and garage. Because\nenergy-conserving homes must be tailored to specific\nsites, Tech House is not a prototype of a mass producible design suitable for all locations. Rather it is a research and development laboratory for testing innovations that can be applied to some degree in all\nhousing.\nThe principal energy-saving comes from using\nthe sun\'s rays to heat the home and provide domestic\nhot water. Sunlight i s captured by 19 solar collectors\non the roof. These south-facing collectors are angled\n\n.\ni\n\'0\n\n5\n\nC\n\n#\n\n> .\n\n. ,\n\nTech House, located a t NASA\'s Langley Research Center,\nHampton, Virginia, is a demonstration project in which\naerospace and commercial building technology are\ncombined to prodwe an energy-efficient borne. Advanced\ntechnology offers savings to the family in utility costs and\nenergy conservation.\n\n1\n\npanel\'s ort the roof of Ted House prwide tbe\nptr\'ncipat ebtergy saving, They captawe the sun\'s rays to\nheat water ita pipes tbat Pvln through the solar collec#ors.\nThe heated water is then stbred in a large, well issulatad\nundergrwnd tank. A heat exchanger extracts beat fiont #be\nwater.and blows i through Bwts to warm tbe house.\nt\n\nThese two tanks make up a unique Tech\nHouse domestic hot water system.\nWater in one tank is \'preheated" by\npolar energy, then fed into the other\nYank where a conventional electric\nheater further raises the temperature if\nnecessary. Preheating takes care of 80\npercent of the hot water energy\nrequirement.\n\n"\n\n:\n\'\n\nTech House is well\ninsulated for energy\nsavings. The principal\ninsulation is fireproof\nTripolymer foam Lhicb\nis sprayed onto walls and\nceilings in thicknesses\nup to six inches.\n\n,\n\nat 58 degrees for best exposure to the Virginia winter\nsun. (In other latitudes, they would be mounted at\ndifferent angles; 21 degrees plus the latitude i s\noptimum.) The individual solar collector has a glass\nouter plate and a metal inner plate, the latter coated\nwith black chrome. The coating, developed in research on solar cells for spacecraft, prevents much of\nthe heat from "reradiating," or escaping outward.\nBlack chrome offers a 20 percent efficiency increase\nin the solar-collection process.\nRunning through the solar collectors are pipes\nthrough which water is circulated from a 2,000-gallon\nunderground storage tank. The water is heated by\nthe sun\'s rays to a temperature of 140 to 170 degrees.\nWhen the house needs heating, the hot water passes\nthrough a heat exchanger, which extracts the heat\nand blows it through ducts to warm the home. When\nheating is not required, the water bypasses the heat\nexchanger and goes directly to the tank for later use.\nThe system i s largely independent of electrical\nenergy, although an electric heat pump is also employed to transfer heat from the storage tank to the\nliving space of the house.\n\nThe storage tank was designed to hold enough\nheat for five days of operation during overcast periods. After that, the temperature of the stored water\nwill fall below 110 degrees. At that point the heat\npump automatically goes into action, elevating the\ntemperature to the requisite level, drawing the water\nfrom the tank and sending it through the heat\nexchanger for heat transfer to the living area. The\nwater then is routed back to the tank.\nFor cooling the house, the heat pump system\n,operates in similar fashion, except that it uses cool\nw ~ w the cooler the water, the more efficient the\n;\npump. Water cooling is accomplished by radiators on\nthe roof. At night, water from the storage tank is run\nthrough the radiators, heat is radiated out, and\ncooled water delivered back to the tank.\n\nFor domestic hot water,Tech House employs a twostage "preheating" method. Water in one tank is\nheated by solar energy, then fed into another tank\nwhere an electrical system provides additional heating if required to reach a preset temperature level.\nPreheating by solar energy generally takes care of 80\npercent of the hot-water energy requirement.\nMuch of the home\'s energy saving potential\nstems from the fact that it is well insulated. The floor\nis a two-inch cast of prefabricatedconcrete insulated\nwith noncombustible gypsum foam. Tripolymer foam\nranging from three and a half to six inches thick\ninsulates the walls and ceiling. An excellent insulator,\nTripolymer is nonflammable, nontoxic, odor free,\nand rodent-resistant.\nThe outer doors are built sandwich-fashion, with\na core of polyurethane foam between the metal\nfacings. The core has four times the density of wood\nand it completely blocks out cold because there is-no\n\ncaptact betwean the inside and outside metal surfaces. Magnetic weather stripping, such. as used in\n, refrigerators, seals the doors.\n.\nWindows not only are double-paned for insulation but also incorporate thermal shutters, Although\nnot products of space technology, the Venetian blind\ntype shutters are rolled down by motor or crank to\nform an exterior window seal.\nThe efficacy of all these insulating measures is\nevident in this fact: in conventional construction it\nwould take a two-ton air-conditionin~\nunit to cool\nthe 1,500 square feet of living area, but Tech House\ncan be kept comfortable bx a orre-ton system. And\nthe superior insulation also sharply reduces noise\ntransmission from the outside and from room to\nroom.\n\nMore Energy Savers\nIn addition to insulation, Tech House boasts a variety\nof other novel design features and systems to reduce\nenergy usage.\nExterior design includes a larger than normal\nroof overhang on the south wall. In winter months,\nwhen heat gain is desirable, sunlight can penetrate\nthe south-facing windows. In the summer, when the\nshutters are rolled up to admit light, the averhang\nprotehs the home from direct sunlight because of\ntfw sun\'s higher angle,\nA large skylight, centrally located above the\nfoyer, admits radiant energy from the sun in the\nwinter, helping to heat the house. The skylight can\nbe opened to create a chimney effect far ventilation.\nIn either winter or summer, the skylight admits\ndaylight to the foyer and living area, reducing the\nneed for artificial light during daytime hours.\nExcept for a glass screen in front of it, the\nfireplace appears to be entirely conventional, but it i s\nnot. An ordinary fireplace draws air from the comparatively warm room, wasting heat. The Tech House\nfireplace derives combustion air from outside\nthrough ducts. Heat from the fireplace radiates into\nthe living roam through the glass screen, but the\nscreen keeps room air from escaping. Additional\nheat is gained from a conventional double walled\nmetal firebox.\nThe grate on which the burning logs rwt is\ncomposed of pipes through which water is circulated. The fire-heated water is passed on to the\nstorage tank as part of the overall heat-capture\nssystem. Where the ordinary fireplace yields only\n\nThe large skyligbt over tbe foyer admits daylight\nto the liiing area, redscing the need for artificial\nlight in daytime. It also admits radiat~t\nenergy\nfim tbe sun, assisting tbe solar cuWectors in\nbeating the home, and serves as a ventilator.\n\n'
