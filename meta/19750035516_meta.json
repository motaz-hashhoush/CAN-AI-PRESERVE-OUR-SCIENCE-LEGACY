Studies have shown that servicing of such a spacecraft on orbit by the Space Shuttle over an extended lifetime is more economical than three other alternatives: launching replacement satellites on conventional boosters as existing satellites fail, launching replacements by Shuttle, or launching replacement satellites and retrieving malfunctioning satellites by Shuttle. For on-orbit servicing, the Shuttle would use its Remote Manipulator system (RMS) to bring the malfunctioning satellite into its cargo bay. The Flight Support System (FSS) on the Orbiter used for servicing the satellite would include an appendage storage frame, a retention cradle, a positioning platform, a Module Exchange Mechanism (MEM), and a storage magazine. Ground simulations are  under way with the Orbiter mockup.", "title": "In-orbit servicing", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T03:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750035516, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cepollina, F.
