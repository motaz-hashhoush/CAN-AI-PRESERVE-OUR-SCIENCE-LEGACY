Direct overlay onto 1:1,000,000 prints takes about one third the time of 1:500,000 zone transfer scope analysis using transparencies, but the consistency of the transparencies reduce the time for data analysis. LANDSAT data received on transparencies is better and more easily interpreted than the near real-time data from Quick Look, or imagery from other sources such as NOAA. The greatest potential for water supply forecasting is probably in improving forecast accuracy and in expanding forecast services during the period of snowmelt. Problems of transient snow line and uncertainties in future weather are the main reasons that snow cover area appears to offer little in water supply forecast accuracy improvement during the peroid snowpack accumulation.", "title": "Application of snowcovered area to runoff forecasting in selected basins of the Sierra Nevada, California", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T08:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19800017256, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brown, A.
