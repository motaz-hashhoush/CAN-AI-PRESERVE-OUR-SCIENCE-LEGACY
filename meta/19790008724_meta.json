A number of potential military support possibilities are described. An SPS with military capabilities may have a strong negative impact on international relations if it is not internationalized. The SPS satellite would be vulnerable to military action of an enemy with good space capability, but would experience little or no threat from saboteurs or terrorists, except via the ground controls. The paper concludes with an outline of some of the key issues involved, and a number of recommendations for future study, including some areas for long term efforts.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790008724, "id": "2a9dd61a48a0426f8bef1d07c847a2d3", "publicationDate": "1978-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790008724.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790008724/downloads/19790008724.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790008724/downloads/19790008724.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790008724/downloads/19790008724.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
