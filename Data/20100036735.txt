b"\\\n\nSource of Acquisition\nNASA Johnson Space Center\n\nCritical Questions for Space Human Factors\n\nBarbara Woolford\nDeputy Project Manager\nSpace Human Factors Engineering\nNASA Advanced Human Support Teclmology Program\nTandi Bagian\nPrincipal Coordinating Scientist\nSpace Human Factors Engineering\nNASA Advanced Human Support Teclmology Program\n\nAbstract\n\nTraditional human factors contributions to NASA's crewed space programs have been rooted in\nthe classic approaches to quantifying human physical and cognitive capabilities and limitations\nin the environment of interest, and producing recommendations and standards for the selection or\ndesign of mission equipment. Crews then evaluate the interfaces, displays, or equipment, and\nwith the assistance of human factors experts, improvements are made as funds, time, control\ndocumentation, and weight allow. We have come a long way from the early spaceflight days,\nwhere men with the ' right stuff were the solution to operating whatever equipment was given to\nthem. The large and diverse Shuttle astronaut corps has impacted mission designs to\naccommodate a wide range of human capabilities and preferences. Yet with existing long\nduration experience, we have seen the need to address a different set of dynamics when\ndesigning for optimal crew performance: critical equipment and mission situations degrade, and\nhuman function changes with mission environment, situation, and duration.\nStrategies for quantifying the critical nature of human factors requirements are being worked by\nNASA. Any exploration-class mission will place new responsibilities on mission designers to\nprovide the crew with the information and resources to accomplish the mission. The current\nduties of a Mission Control Center to monitor system status, detect degradation or malfunction,\nand provide a proven solution, \\vill need to be incorporated into on-board systems to allow the\ncrew autonomous decision-making. The current option to resupply and replace mission systems\nand resources, including both vehicle equipment and human operators, will be removed, so\nconsiderations of maintenance, onboard training, and proficiency assessment are critical to\nproviding a self-sufficient crew.\nAs we 'move in' to the International Space Station, there are tremendous opportunities to\ninvestigate our ability to design for autonomous crews. Yet prioritizing the research that can and\nshould be done by NASA will be based on the critical nature of the issues, and the impact of the\nindividual research questions on mission design. The risks to crew health and safety associated\nwith answering critical human factors issues must be properly included and communicated in\norder to support the Agency's decisions regarding future space programs.\n\n"
