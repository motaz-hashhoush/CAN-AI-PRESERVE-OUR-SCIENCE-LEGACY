AeroMACS development has progressed from requirements definition through technology definition, prototype deployment and testing, and now into national and international standards development. The first prototype AeroMACS system has been deployed at the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport (CLE) and the adjacent NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC). During the past 3 years, extensive technical testing has taken place to characterize the performance of the AeroMACS prototype and provide technical support for the standards development process. The testing has characterized AeroMACS link and network performance over a variety of conditions for both fixed and mobile data transmission and has included basic system performance testing and fixed and mobile applications testing. This paper provides a summary of the AeroMACS performance testing and the status of standardization activities that the testing supports.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130011699, "endDate": "2013-03-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "5db9c986d4e04e65b1af0787b94b574d", "id": "312c1bb957004cf8a67b0bd252449f46"}], "name": "2013 Aerospace Conference", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "5db9c986d4e04e65b1af0787b94b574d", "startDate": "2013-03-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130011699, "id": "4345d187763a44b5b038a4d7bd25794c", "publicationDate": "2013-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130011699.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130011699/downloads/20130011699.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130011699/downloads/20130011699.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130011699/downloads/20130011699.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
