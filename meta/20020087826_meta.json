Loosening is caused between the flanks of the bolt and nut threads. This lateral movement releases the locking friction that holds the joint together. Spiralock is a uniquely designed female thread form which used with male fasteners of standard thread form provides a self locking action that prevents the lateral movement, and thus makes the threaded joint highly resistant to the effects of vibration. Additionally, a thread contract runs the entire length of the nut, offering greater stress resistance than earlier fasteners.", "title": "Self Locking Fasteners", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020087826, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020087826, "id": "1fe9d53ef0c144ab8d9a13de15319052", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1987", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020087826.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020087826/downloads/20020087826.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020087826/downloads/20020087826.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020087826/downloads/20020087826.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
