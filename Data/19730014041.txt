b'NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND\nSPACE ADMINISTRATION\nWashington, D. C. 20546\nFOR RELEASE:\nMay 7, 1973\n1:45 p . m . , Monday\n\nNick Panagakos\nHeadquarters, Washington, D.C\n(Phone: 202/755-3680)\n\nRELEASE NO:\n\n73-91\n\nVIKING LANDING SITES\n\nA valley near the mouth of the 20,000-foot-deep Martian\nGrand Canyon has been chosen by NASA as the site of\n\nits\n\nfirst automated landing on the planet Mars.\n\nThe landing site for the second mission of the 1975-76\nViking spacecraft will probably be an area about 1,000\nmiles northeast of the first site, where the likelihood of\nwater increases the chances of finding evidence of l i f e .\n\nBoth sites are fairly smooth, relatively calm areas in\nthe planet\'s lowlands.\n\n(NASA-News-Pelease-73-91) V I K I N G L A N D I N G\nSITES News Release ( N A S A )\n1U p\nCSCL 22A\n\nN73-22768\n\nG3/30\n\n[Tnclas\n023U7\n\n-2-\n\nSelection of the tentative landing areas was announced\nby NASA today, culminating a year-long study and evaluation\nof 22 potential sites by teams of prominent scientists.\n\nThe two Viking spaceships, carrying life-detection\ninstruments, are scheduled to be launched towards Mars in\nthe summer of 1975, the second about a month after the\nfirst.\n\nThe journey will take nearly a year.\n\nThe prime target for the first mission is a region\nknown as Chryse (19.5\xc2\xb0 N, 34 W), at the northeast end of\nthe giant 3,000-mile-long rift canyon discovered on Mars by\nthe still-orbiting Mariner 9 spacecraft.\n\nThe rift system\n\nruns out into a series of long channels which resemble\ndried-out river beds.\n\nThe landing site chosen for the second mission is\nCydonia, in the Mare Acidalium region (44.3\xc2\xb0 N. 10\xc2\xb0 W), at\nthe edge of the southernmost reaches of the north polar\nhood -- a hazy veil which shrouds each polar region during\nthe winter season, and which some scientists believe may\ncarry moisture.\n\n-more-\n\n-3The sites were chosen on the basis of scientific\ninterest and the probability of landing successfully.\n\nSuch\n\nfactors as elevation, terrain roughness and slope, and wind\nvelocities and directions are critical to a successful\nlanding.\n\nDetailed study was made of the maps produced by Mariner\n9, including pictures with resolutions as fine as 100 meters\n(328 feet). These photographs were correlated with data\ntaken by other Mariner 9 instruments -- infrared spectrometer, and radio -- which provided information on temperature, pressure, humidity, and general atmospheric and\nsurface characteristics of Mars. Ground-based radar observations were used to predict the elevation, surface roughness and bearing strength of the landing areas.\n\nSites were chosen on the basis of these characteristics:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLow Elevation.\n\nThe Martian atmosphere is very\n\nthin. The lower elevations, with a higher atmospheric\npressure, provide a greater margin of safety for the Viking\nLander, which uses a combination of aeroshell, parachutes\nand braking rockets to slow down its descent.\n\n-more-\n\n-4\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPossibility of Water.\n\nSince Viking has as one of\n\nits principal objectives the search for life, the search for\nwater is very important.\n\nRegions of high pressure are the\n\nmost likely to harbor liquid water.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInteresting Geological Features.\n\nThe Mariner\n\npictures were studied very carefully in an attempt to select\nsites smooth enough to land safely while at the same time\npossessing features of high geological interest.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFavorable Meteorological Conditions.\n\nHigh winds\n\nare known to exist on Mars, as evidenced by the planet-wide\ndust storm observed by Mariner 9 and Earth-based telescopes.\nVery high winds are potentially hazardous to spacecraft\nlanding.\n\nBy studying wind-induced streaking marks shown on\n\nMariner photographs, scientists can identify and avoid high\nwind regions.\n\nThe Viking lander is designed to land in\n\nwinds with velocities up to 150 miles an hour.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSmoothness and Slope of Terrain. The nine-inch\n\nclearance under the lander body requires a relatively smooth\nsurface, and to assure landing stability the sites should\nhave slopes no greater than 19\xc2\xb0.\n\nAt the same time, the area\n\nmust be free of extensive smooth-rock surfaces or thick dust\nlayers.\n\nLanding on a smooth-rock surface would make sample\n\nacquisition difficult or impossible; a site thought to be\ncovered by a deep layer of soft material could mean\ninadequate surface bearing strength.\n-more-\n\n-5Project Viking seeks to advance significantly scientific knowledge of the planet Mars, with emphasis on determining if life once existed or is now present.\n\nAfter a trip of 460 million miles, the two spacecraft\nwill go into highly elliptical orbits from which they will\nstudy the preselected sites in an attempt to certify that\nthey are safe and scientifically attractive. Then each\nspacecraft will separate into two parts, an orbiter and a\nlander.\n\nTogether they will conduct scientific studies of\n\nthe Martian atmosphere and surface.\n\nEach lander carries a miniature chemical laboratory\nwhich will analyze samples of Martian soil for signs of\nlife.\n\nA ten-foot retractable claw will be used to scoop the\n\nsoil samples for analysis.\n\nOther instruments will analyze\n\nthe atmosphere, measure pressure, temperature, wind\nvelocity, composition of the soil, and quake activity. The\ndata, transmitted to Earth directly or via relay link with\nthe orbiter, will include panoramic, stereo, color and\ninfrared pictures of the lander\'s immediate surroundings.\n\nThe lander capsule will have been heat-sterilized before launch to comply with international planetary quarantine requirements, and to prevent false signals in the\nlife-detect!on experiments.\n-more-\n\n-6While the Viking lander probes the Martian surface, the\norbiter will perform visual (television), thermal, and water\nvapor mapping.\n\nThe Chryse (rhymes with "icy") site is scientifically\ninteresting because it appears to be at the lower end of a\nlong valley where the largest group of "stream" channels on\nMars starts to diverge.\n\nThe site may have been a drainage\n\nbasin for a large portion of equatorial Mars, and hence\nwould be expected to have collected deposits of a variety\nof surface materials.\n\nIt is also one of the lowest regions\n\nstudied, about 5 kilometers (16,000 feet) lower than the\nmean surface of the planet.\n\nCydonia, the prime site for the second mission, is even\nlower than Chryse \xe2\x80\x94 18,000 feet below the mean surface.\nCydonia (Sy-don\'-i-a) was selected because of the possibility of finding biologically-available water.\n\n-more-\n\n-7To look for life is to search for the water.\n\nMars is\n\nknown to have water vapor in its atmosphere, and the subsurface polar caps are believed to be made up in part of\nwater ice. But scientists are searching for a region that\nwould permit, for short periods, the existence of liquid\nwater. This means landing in a region where the pressure\non the surface is at least 6.1 millibars, the minimum\npressure required for liquid water to exist, and where the\ntemperature rises at least to 273\xc2\xb0 K (0 c).\n\nAt Cydonia, the atmospheric pressure is 7.8 millibars\nand temperature may rise as high as 0\xc2\xb0 C.\n\nCydonia is at a\n\nlatitude that is far enough north to believe that seasonal\nice is deposited, and southerly enough to predict that in\nthe summer the temperature rises to the melting point.\n\nIn addition to satisfying the selection criteria, the\nsites offer a unique advantage due to their relative\npositions; both landers will be within communication and\nviewing range of both orbiters.\n\nThus one orbiter can be\n\nreleased from synchronous orbit over its lander for lowaltitude observations of other regions of interest, while\nthe second orbiter acts as a monitor and data relay station\nfor both landers.\n-more-\n\n-8Although mission operations are being planned on the\nbasis of selected sites, Viking can be retargeted to alternate sites up to the last midcourse correction (about 10\ndays before encounter), if necessary.\n\nIn addition, the\n\nspacecraft itself has a limited capability to retarget the\nlander if observations from orbit prior to lander separation show the preselected site to be unsafe or undesirable.\n\nThe backup site for Chryse is Tritonis Lacus (Treetone \'is Lah\'cuss) at 20.5\xc2\xb0 North latitude, 252 West longitude.\n\nIf site certification by the Viking Orbiter indicates\n\nthat Chryse is unsuitable for any reason, the lander will\nbe retargeted to Tritonis Lacus.\n\nAlba, "The White Region," is the backup site for\nCydonia.\n\nIt lies at 44.2\xc2\xb0 North latitude and 110\xc2\xb0 West\n\nlongitude.\nBoth the prime and backup sites for the second mission\nare in the area of maximum biological interest, 40\n\nto 50\n\nnorth latitude. Current plans call for landings along the\n44-degree line, but the project has the flexibility to switch\nto 50\xc2\xb0 if observations from the first Viking orbiter indicate that there is a safe landing site at that latitude for\nthe second mission.\n-more-\n\n-9Viking is managed for NASA\'s Office of Planetary Programs by the Langley Research Center, which also has\nresponsibility for two of the six major systems constituting\nthe project: the Lander System and the Launch and Flight\nOperations System.\n\nMartin Marietta Aerospace, Denver,\n\nColorado, is the prime contractor, responsible for the\nlander and for project Integration. The Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory manages the Orbiter System, the Viking Mission\nControl and Computer Center, and the Deep Space Network;\nand the Lewis Research Center manages the Launch Vehicle\nSystem.\n\nWalter Jakobowski, NASA Headquarters, is program\nmanager, and James S. Martin, Jr., Langley, is project\nmanager.\n\n-more-\n\n-10VIKING SITE SELECTION GROUPS\n\nViking landing sites were selected by NASA on the\nbasis of recommendations by the Viking Landing Site Working\nGroup, a panel of 17 noted scientists, and evaluation of\nthese recommendations by the Viking Science Steering Group,\nwhich is comprised of the team leaders for the 13 investigations to be conducted during the mission.\nVIKING LANDING SITE WORKING GROUP\n\nA.

And not much more distant are\nUchronia, which means a place-without-time, and Utopia,\nwhich is no-where.\n\n- more -\n\n-14Chryse, the tentative landing site for the first Viking\nMission, means "land of gold," and is believed to be derived\nfrom the writings of Ptolemy and later pinpointed as modernday Burma. Appropriately enough, it is bordered on the\nMartian map by the Indus and Ganges.\nThe landing site for the second mission, Cydonia, is\nthe name of a town in Crete, which in turn is named for\nKydon, son of the fabled king of Crete, Minos.\nAcidalium\n\nMare\n\nis named after the waters in which Aphrodite\n\n(Venus), accompanied by the Graces, is supposed to have\nbathed daily.\nThe backup landing site for the first mission,\nTritonis Lacus, the Lake of Triton, is named for a\nlegendary river in Tunisia visited by Jason and the\nArgonauts.\n\n865-ios\n\n'
