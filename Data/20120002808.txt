This talk is a follow-on\nfrom an AIAA talk given by Chuck Fulcher from Hamilton Sundstrand. An overview of the Chinese\nspacesuit and life-support system, were assessed from video downlinks during their EVA and from those\nassessments, spacesuit characteristics were identified and will be provided. The space suits will be\ncompared against the Russian Orlan Spacesuit and the U.S. Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). In\naddition, China\xe2\x80\x99s plans for future missions will be shown.\nBiography: Mr. Lewis Croog graduated from the University of Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1984 with two\nBachelor of Science degrees in Biomedical Engineering and Electrical Engineering. He also entered a\nMaster of Science degree program in Biomedical Engineering at Trinity College in Hartford Connecticut.\nHis work career in space systems started with Hamilton Sundstrand in Windsor Locks, Connecticut and\nlead to working in Space Life Sciences with Krug International/Wyle Labs at JSC from 1988 through 2005.\nProjects included Space Motion Sickness Studies, cardiovascular de-conditioning studies from prolonged\nweightlessness and then onto cellular tissue changes in 0g as the lead electrical designer on the ISS\nBioreactor Project. Following post Columbia, he was transferred to Lockheed to support work on RCC\nrepair methods. Eventually he went to work with Jacobs Engineering providing support to EC5 PLSS\n\nhardware development for Constellation, and as a systems engineer with the level 3 EVA SE&I group,\nperforming analysis on EVA spacesuit systems. At the time of this recording Mr. Croog was employed by\nJacobs Engineering.\nKnowledge Capture POCs:\nCinda Chullen, manager\ncinda.chullen-1@nasa.gov\n(281) 483-8384\nRose

Spacesuit Analysis\nPresented by Lewis Croog/Jacobs Engineering/ESCG\nFebruary 18, 2010\n\nChinese EVA\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nImmediately following the Chinese EVA on September 27th, 2008 it\nwas noticed that the Feitian (Fa-tien) spacesuit and Russian Orlan\nwere very similar.\nPrior to this EVA there was no information on the Chinese spacesuits.\nThe EVA lasted 18 minutes (it was more for a proof of concept and\nPublic Relations)\nLooking like the Orlan suit, (\ng\n, (Orlan M) p j\n) projections can be made on the\nperformance.\n\n2\n\nChinese EVA Suits\n\xe2\x80\xa2There were two suits involved in this EVA. One was the Chinese Feitian, the\nother (backup) was the Orlan spacesuit.\n(\np)\np\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2Feitian means flying in the sky (named for a flying Buddhist goddess)\n\xe2\x80\xa2In April 2004, the Chinese purchased EVA space hardware from Russia.\np\n,\np\np\nAccording to a contract signed in April, 2004, a Russian company provided\nthree Orlan suits, two low-pressure Launch Entry suits, four suits for\nunderwater training, and four sets of docking systems. The Chinese side is\nresponsible f providing power and communications equipment f th EVA\nibl for\nidi\nd\ni ti\ni\nt for the\nsuits.\n3\n\nChinese Feitian vs NASA EMU\nRussian Orlan/Feitian Spacesuit comparisons against the EMU\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRussian Orlan spacesuits are one size fits all They have sizing straps to bring in the arms\nall.\nand legs but that\xe2\x80\x99s it. Whereas the EMU can be sized for many different sizes of people.\nRussian suits are certified for 15 uses or 4 years and then they just throw them away. The\nEMU with maintenance can go a long time (25 years). The Chinese suits used on this\nmission were di\ni i\ndiscarded b f\nd d before crew d\ndescent.\nt\nNominal pressure is 5.7 psi in the Orlan. So it is assumed as 5.7 psi in the Chinese suits.\nThe Life Support System in the Orlan is located inside the suit itself located in the 100%\noxygen environment. On the EMU it is outside the suit within the PLSS.\nyg\nThe Orlan uses an active thermal control system, an LCG, and cools through a sublimator\nas in the EMU.\nOrlan is made to do an Automonous EVA and it also has umbilical capability which is what\nthe Feitian used during this EVA\nEVA.\n\n4\n\nLeroy Chiao\xe2\x80\x99s visit to China\nAmerican Astronaut Leroy Chiao\xe2\x80\x99s\nComments on Feitian Suit\nCommander and NASA Science Officer on Expedition-10\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c I was impressed with the suit. It has obvious Russian Orlan heritage, with some\ndifferences. The Display and Control Module looked similar, as did the pressure\nregulators and the oxygen injector switch. The hatch latching mechanism also looked\nsimilar. So did the umbilical interfaces.\nIn fact it is reasonable to assume that the spacecraft interfaces are identical\nfact,\nto the Russian system, since the second suit worn by Liu Boming was in\nfact an Orlan.\nThere is nothing wrong with this approach. It is arguably optimal to take an\ng\ng\np\np\n,\ng\ny\nproven.\nexisting design and improve upon it, while retaining critical systems that are p\nIn my view, China is taking a very logical course in developing their manned space\ncapability.\xe2\x80\x9d\n5\n\nChinese \xe2\x80\x93 Russian EVA Spacesuit Comparison\nHow does the Feitian differ from the Orlan?\nOn Feitian, the suit pressure g g is on top of DCM ( p y Control Module.) It is a\n,\np\ngauge\np\n(Display\n)\nmechanical gauge. On an Orlan suit it is located on the arm.\n\nChinese DCM\n\nRussian DCM\n\n6\n\nChinese Feitian \xe2\x80\x93 Russian Orlan Comparison\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA sliding handle on Orlan has been replaced with a rotating knob for controlling\ntemperature, though the rest of the architecture looks the same.\nTemperature Control\n\n7\n\nDifference between Chinese Helmet and Orlan\nHelmet\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Feitian visor is larger and wider than on the Orlan helmet\nThe Feitian helmet is assumed to be built onto the torso as one piece, just as the\nOrlan helmet, in\nO l h l t i comparison against th removable EMU h l t\ni\ni t the\nbl\nhelmet.\nThe Orlan-M has a moon roof on the helmet, the Feitian did not.\nFeitian Helmet\n\nRussian LCG with cap\nseen on Chinese video\n\nOrlan Helmet with moon\nroof\n\nAccording to Liu Guoning, suit designer, the helmet is made of a\npolycarbonate material and has four layers of protection\nincluding a gas filled layer of nitrogen gas. It is heat- and soundg\nprotects the astronaut from harm done by\ny\ninsulating, and p\npossible collisions. It has a ventilation device and a visor antifogging coating.\n8\n\nChinese IVA and EVA Gloves\nGloves look like Sokol IVA and Orlan EVA gloves.\nFeitian EVA Glove\nFeitian IVA Glove\n\n9\n\nUmbilical and Interface\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThough the Orlan operates autonomously on the ISS, the Feitian used the Orlan style\numbilical connection as the nominal EVA umbilical interface. The umbilical provides\nhardline communications and power. It is claimed to also carry an emergency oxygen\nsupply tube From a Chinese newspaper article they describe two umbilicals one at\ntube.\narticle,\numbilicals,\n8m length, the other at 4m length.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRussians use a spacesuit interface control panel inside an airlock. The Chinese airlock\nlooks like it has the exact same EVA control panel as the Russians.\n\n10\n\nChinese \xe2\x80\x93 Russian EVA Comparison\nLiu Guoning, a researcher of China\'s Manned Space Engineering Programme,\ntalks about the extravehicular spacesuit at the Shenzhou VII Manned Space Flight\nMedia Center on September 25, 2008. [Wang Wei/China.org.cn]\n\nAccording to Liu, there are differences in technology and reliability, the Chinese\n"Feitian" is equipped with a number of new features.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFirstly, digital technology is extensively applied in the design of Feitian while Orlan-M,\nOrlan M,\nresearched and designed in the 1970s-80s, only carries simulation technology. For Feitian,\nimage and data transmission and information collection is conducted by digital signals.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ny,\n(\np\n)\ngy\npp\nSecondly, CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access network) technology is applied in the\nFeitian\'s communication system while the Russian version depends on short-wave\ncommunication.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ny,\ng\ng\np\n,\njoints of\nThirdly, following the design of the intravehicular spacesuit, the elbow and knee j\nFeitian are softer than those of the Russian version.\n11\n\nTraining Facilities\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTraining facilities\n- The high fidelity training facilities and simulators are very similar to Russian training facilities.\ny\n- They have thermal vacuum chambers that look the same as the ones in Russia.\n- They built a hydrolab to do their EVA training, very similar to one in Russia. It is 23 meters in diameter\nand 10 meters deep. It is made to hold larger vehicles and larger mockups for future plans.\n\n12\n\nTraining at Hydrolab in China\n\n13\n\nChinese EVA\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Video of the EVA can be seen on these links:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhjnT8Oqhjk\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UJJp6AWZfw\n\nNotes from video:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHe is struggling with the hatch.

Chinese spacesuit, cost up to 4.4 million dollars each.\n3. The\n3 "The surface material made up of advanced synthetic fabric boasts\nmaterial,\nfabric,\ncharacteristics such as fire and radiation resistance that meet spacewalk\nrequirements," the newspaper quoted Pang Zhihao, a Chinese space expert.\n4. The surface material should protect astronauts from extreme heat on the side\nexposed to the sun at temperatures more than 200 degrees Celsius and\nCelsius,\nextreme cold on the shaded side, said Pang. The material can also protect\nastronauts from injury from floating micro-meteoroids in space, Pang added.\n5. With a flexible limb joint design, the suits can be donned by occupants ranging\nfrom 1 60 to 1 80 meters tall (5 3 \xe2\x80\x93 5\xe2\x80\x9911\xe2\x80\x9d)\n1.60 1.80\n(5\xe2\x80\x993\xe2\x80\x9d 5 11 ).\n6. It took 11 hours for unpacking and assembling of the EVA suits in the orbital\nmodule. Pre-breathe time is approximately 100 minutes.\n\n16\n\nShenzhou spacecraft\n\nChinese taikonauts move from the re entry module\nre-entry\nof the Shenzhou-7 spacecraft to its orbital module,\nstarting preparations for China\'s first space walk.\n\nShenzhou spacecraft\nThe Long March 2F has improved guidance and\ncontrol equipment. They\'ve upgraded the engines\nand have new computer systems onboard.\np\ny\n\n17\n\nShenzhou 7 vs. Soyuz\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nShenzhou (meaning \xe2\x80\x9cDivine Vessel\xe2\x80\x9d) is based on the well-proven Russian Soyuz design.\nLike the Soyuz, the Shenzhou too consists of three modules. A service module with the\nspacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s p p\np\npropulsion systems, instrumentation and a set of solar p\ny\n,\npanels come at the\nrear. In the middle is the re-entry capsule in which up to three astronauts can travel to and\nfrom space. Right in front is the orbital module that provides living space for the astronauts\nduring the mission.\nBut the Shenzhou is not a copy of the Soyuz. It is larger , and the spacecraft and its\nSoyuz\nsystems have been designed and manufactured by the Chinese to meet their\nrequirements. For instance, its orbital module, unlike that of the Soyuz, is equipped with a\npropulsion system and solar panels. So even after the astronauts return to the earth in the\nre entry capsule,\nre-entry capsule the orbital module can be operated from the ground by remote control for\nseveral months more.\n\n18\n\nLaunch Entry Suits\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Chinese crew launch in the Sokol launch entry suit.\n\nShenzhou Pressure Suits\n\nSoyuz Sokol Suits\n\n19\n\nEarth Entry\n\xe2\x80\xa2 China mobilized about 300 search and rescue workers,\ng\n,\nincluding air and land forces, to meet the Shenzhou-7 crew\nat the main landing zone on Sunday.\n\n20\n\nLanding\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Module parachuted down on a grassland at Siziwang\np ,\np\ny\nBanner at 5:37 p.m., soldiers and experts were already on\nthe way to the landing site by car or by helicopter.\n\nChina\'s Shenzhou-7 spacecraft\'s re-entry module lands safely in north China\'s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.\n\n21\n\nRe-entry module on ground\nTechnicians help the three Chinese taikonauts get out of Shenzhou-7 re-entry module\n\n22\n\nRe-entry module on ground\n\nChinese taikonauts get ready to get out of Shenzhou-7 re-entry module\n\n23\n\nRe-entry module on ground\n\n24\n\n13 Monitoring Stations\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe network is made up of thirteen monitoring and controlling stations and ships, deployed in different\nparts of the world. They include four "Yuanwang" vessels on the three big oceans, five stationary\nmeasuring stations in the territory of China, one mobile measuring station and three monitoring and\ncontrolling stations in other countries, i l di a new one i M li di of K\nt lli\nt ti\ni th\nti\nincluding\nin Malindi f Kenya.

They would dock in\nLEO and the Earth departure stage would send the\nShenzhou round the Moon."\n31\n\nFuture Plans of Chinese Space Program\n01 March 2009\nChina Moon Probe Ends Mission:\nSpace Station Plans detailed\nChina s\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s first probe sent to the Moon has ended its mission\nmission.\nAccording to the Xinhua news service, Chang\xe2\x80\x99e-1 smashed into the lunar surface under remote\ncontrol at 3:36 p.m. Beijing time on March 1st.\nChang\xe2\x80\x99e-1 -- named after a legendary Chinese moon goddess -- was dispatched to the Moon on October\n24, 2007 \xe2\x80\x93 billed by China as the first phase of a three-step Moon exploration strategy. The planned\nimpact of the lunar orbiter on the Moon has helped hone skills needed for a follow-on robotic landing\nupon the lunar surface.\nXinhua noted sources within the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National\nDefense concerning the impact time of the craft on the Moon carried out by two Earth observation and\nMoon,\ncontrol stations in China.\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s lunar plans call for a soft-landing on the Moon of a rover around 2012. A third phase of the plan\nwould use another rover to snag lunar samples then return those materials to the Earth in 2017.\nChinese space scientists were delighted with the success of Chang\'e-1. Part of its scientific output was to\nrelay a fi t f ll map of th M\nl\nfirst full\nf the Moon.\nMeanwhile, both India and Japan continue to have active spacecraft in orbit around the Moon. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is now targeted for launch on May 20.\nIt has also been reported that China will launch a space module in late 2010 -- calling it "Heavenly\nPalace-1" -- a step toward building a larger space station. The module would weigh over 8 tons,\np\ng\ng\np\ng\n,\naccording to news sources in Beijing, with a Shenzhou-8 spacecraft docking to the Heavenly Palace-1\nearly in 2011.\n32\n\nFuture Plans of Chinese Space Program\nReports: China to Launch Second Moon Probe in 2009\nChina is planning to launch a second spacecraft to explore the moon even as its first lunar orbiter\ncontinues to map the lunar surface, the country\'s state-run media has reported.\nThe new probe, Chang\'e 2 is slated to launch sometime in 2009 according to reports by the\nprobe Chang e 2,\n2009,\nXinhua News Agency and China Central Television. Ye Peijian, lead designer and commander of\nChina\'s Chang\'e 1 lunar orbiter currently circling the moon, announced plans for the second\nmission, but provided little additional details, Xinhua reported.\nChang\'e 1 is a 5,180-pound (2,350-kg) satellite that launched Oct. 24 from China\'s Xichang\nSatellite Launch C t i th southwest Si h\nS t llit L\nh Center in the\nth\nt Sichuan P i\nProvince t spend about one year mapping and\nto\nd b t\ni\nd\nstudying the moon. The spacecraft is based on China\'s Dongfanghong 3 telecommunication\nsatellite platform and equipped with eight primary instruments, though Ye did not state whether its\nChang\'e 2 successor would be based on a similar design.\nBut the success of Chang\'e 1 to date, especially its survival of a Feb. 20 eclipse that starved its\ng\n, p\ny\np\npower-generating solar panels of sunlight, have been under discussion, according to a series of\nreports by Xinhua and other outlets.\n"Chang\'e 1 passed the test," Xinhua quoted Ye as saying after last month\'s total lunar eclipse. The\neclipse forced the lunar orbiter to consume about 40 percent of its overall battery power, less than\nthe 60 percent expected before the eclipse and left it out of contact with flight controllers in Beijing\neclipse,\nfor about 49 minutes, Xinhua reported.\nThe eclipse left the lunar probe without direct sunlight for about 80 minutes, though it did fire its\nrocket engine to tweak its orbital path to minimize the time in shadow, Gu Shen, deputy director of\nChang\'e 1\'s measurement and control systems, told Xinhua.\nChina\'s Chang\'e 1 spaceflight is part of a three-stage plan to explore the moon with orbiting\nspacecraft, rovers and ultimately a sample return mission.\n33\n\nSokol / Shenzhou LEA Suit\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nElectrical cables are mounted on the right abdomen of the suit; on the left abdomen there are separate hoses for air and\noxygen. Normally, an electric blower ventilates the suit with cabin air through the larger hose at the rate of 150 litres (5.3\ncubic feet) per minute. If the cabin pressure drops below (8.7 psi) the air supply is automatically replaced with oxygen\nfrom pressurized bottles. Both air and oxygen exhaust through the blue pressure relief valve at the centre of the chest,\nthis valve also regulates the pressure of the suit.\nThis has the advantage of simplicity; the disadvantage of a high rate of oxygen consumption is considered acceptable\ngiven that it is only intended for emergency use.\n\nSokol S\nS\nSuit\nChinese Shenzhou LEA Suit\n34\n\n'
