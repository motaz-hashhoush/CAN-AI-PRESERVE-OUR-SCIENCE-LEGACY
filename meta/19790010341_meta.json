The first section describes tilt and leveling measurements on Anegada, the most northerly of the British Virgin Islands; the second section contains a discussion of sea-level measurements that were initiated in the region and which played a significant role in the development of a network of sea-level monitors now telemetered via satellite from the Alaskan Shumagin Islands. The third part of the report is a brief description of surface deformation measurements in Iceland using equipment and techniques developed by the subject grant.
