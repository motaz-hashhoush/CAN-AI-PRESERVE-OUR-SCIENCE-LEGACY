This is especially important because the outer walls of pressurized volumes are often not easily accessible, blocked by racks or cabinets. The goal of the Habitat Particle Impact Monitoring System (HIMS) is to develop a fully automated, end-to-end particle impact detection system for crewed space exploration modules. The HIMS uses multiple passive, thin film piezo-polymer vibration sensors to detect impacts on a surface, and computer processing of the acoustical signals to characterize the impacts. Development and demonstration of the HIMS is proceeding in concert with NASA's Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) Project. The HDU Project is designed to develop and test various technologies, configurations, and operational concepts for exploration habitats. This paper describes the HIMS development, initial testing, and HDU integration efforts. Initial tests of the system on the HDU were conducted at NASA s 2010 and 2011 Desert Research and Technologies Studies (Desert-RATS or D-RATS). The HDU lab module, as seen from above, has an open circular floorplan divided into eight wedge-shaped Segments. The side wall of the module -- the surface used for this technology demonstration -- is a hard fiberglass composite covered with a layer of sprayed-on foam insulation. Four sensor locations were assigned near the corners of a rectangular pattern on the wall of one segment of the HDU lab module. The flat, self-adhesive sensors were applied to the module during its initial outfitting. To study the influence of the wall s construction (thickness and materials), three sets of four sensors were installed at different layer depths: on the interior of the module s wall, on the exterior of the same wall, and on the exterior of the foam insulation. The signal produced when a vibration passes through a sensor is first sent through a pre-amplifier. The amplified signal then is sent to the data acquisition and data processing systems. The vibration data from the sensors are then processed and reduced to a form suitable for presentation to the crew.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120002787, "endDate": "2012-06-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "528a06c1dace4ebe95a3b6bdaadf53a5", "id": "160cb8f924fd45a2a98ccb3faa91e6ad"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronomical Society", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "528a06c1dace4ebe95a3b6bdaadf53a5", "id": "69e988055c7c48e584ad748ec8f553be"}], "name": "1st Annual International Space Station (ISS) Research and Development Conferenc", "location": "Denver, CO", "id": "528a06c1dace4ebe95a3b6bdaadf53a5", "startDate": "2012-06-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120002787, "id": "af879450e6bd44a7a5f90985b2084c0a", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120002787.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120002787/downloads/20120002787.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120002787/downloads/20120002787.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120002787/downloads/20120002787.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
