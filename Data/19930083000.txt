The "C.E . P,A." (C.ommission dlEtudes Pratiqu e s de J. IAvia-\n\ntion) , wnose task wa.s to study all technical problems .\n\nSince t )::.e\n\nParis technical section of aeronautics has no naval airdrome, all\nnew seaplanes are test ed a t Saint Raphael.\n\nThey are all triple-\n\nen gin e seaplanes of 1000 HP (Nieuport" Georges Lev-j and Latham),\nwhich have given fairly good results, but are still far from being\nfi t ted f or uae on t he h igh se a s.\nThe C.E.P . A. studies\n\nma~y\n\nproblems which concern on ly the\n\nNayy, particularly the launching of torpedoes .\n\nW\nhile awaiting the\n\ntorpedo airplanes which have not yet left the shops, t he commi s sion is using for this study a 700 HP seaplane, with two hulls and\nt wo engines" a veritable monster which flies po\xc2\xb7o rly, but whic h has\nenabled considerable progress toward the solution of the problem.\nThe torpedo used is of the newest type and weighs 800 kg.\n\nW\nhen\n\ndropped from an altitude of less than ten meters, t he straightness\n\n\\\n\n5 -\n\nof its path in the water is assured.\nThe C.E . P.A. has also expe::imented m\nuch with "amphi b ians"\n( G~ La\n\nand F.B.A., with skis; H3nriot, whose floats are air bags\n\nvihi ch the pilot inflates j1..\'.st b~fore alightj.ng on the water), but\nj.-ts Q.eans are so greatly rec1uced that these exp e riments ha ve been\n\nsuspended.\nco ~trol\n\nIt also studies aLL\'plane observation problems .. fire\n\nof battleships by radiotelephony, mounting of guns on air-\n\nplanes and dropping bombs from high altitudes.\n\nIn the latter ex-\n\nercise, the same principles a re observed as in pursuit exercises.\nThere are to be no more\n\nindivi~ual\n\nbombardments .. where each one\n\nfires at will ana where only aces succeed.\n\nHere again the squad-\n\nron consists of three triangles of three a irplanes each.\n\nThe\n\nsquadron commander transmits to the triangles the coordinates of\nt he target.\n\nTne first triangle flies over it and drops its bombs)\n\nwhich) for exanple .. fall beyond the target.\n\nThe second triangle,\n\nimmediately following it, adjusts its fire accordingly and transmits its correction to the\nlatter1s bombs fall short.\nthird triangle.\n\nt~ird\n\ntriangle.\n\nLet us suppose that the\n\nThe target is then bracketed for the\n\nThe triangles, passing in a ci r cle above the tar-\n\nget, can thus reduce their errors .. like artillery gunners on the\nground, until they hit the ts;rget.\n\nBy this method, for b omba!\'2.:\'ng\n\nat 1500 meters altitude, the probable error has been reduced to ten\nmeters.\nThe C.E.P.A. also serves as an advisory board to the general\nstaff on all questions, even of a military nature, relating to avi\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nation, although this was not originally included in its duties.\n\n-\' 6 -\n\n4. Lastly, the IIAviation d\'Escadre ll (our only naval "escadreJ\'\n.\n\n.\n\nwhich is in the Mediterranean) has a temporary camp at S::!J.J:L"t Raph?Je l.\n\nIt is placed dtrectly under the orders of the vice-admiral\n\ncommand.er-in-chief of the "escadre" and is composed entirely of\nlandplanes.\n\nIt co:n.ststs of one Salmson observation squad:!"on (es-\n\ncadrille), one Hanrloti pur sui t squadron and a few ail.\'Planes for\nexperimental purposes.\n\nAll the pilots are licensed pursuit\n\npilots.\n\n. ..\nThe Itav.i.\'ation d 1 e8cadre,1I being the only airplane

po \xc2\xb7-\n\nsition, because of the superiority of airplanes over seaplanes\nfrom the military point of view.\n\nIt has devised a method for air-\n\nplanes to take off from and. alight on 8hips.\na) Taking off.- At the end of the war , when the defects of\nseaplanes every day increased the precariousness of their\nLieutenant Teste attempted to\nret of a battle8hip.\n\nt~ke\n\nservice~\n\noff from a platform on a tur-\n\nThis poorly prepared experiment only re-\n\nsuIted in a terrible fallon the forward deck of the ship.\nmethod has since been improved.\n\nWe\n\nhave~\n\nThe\n\nas yet, no airplane car-\n\nrier, but a platform 15 meters long by 6 meters wide has been\nmounted on the cruiser Bapaume and pilots are now being trained\nto take oIf from it.\n\nNaturally, it is possible to take off only\n\nwhen the ship is going ahead under full steam, so that its speed\nwill be added to that of the\n\nairplane~\n\nwhich does not have a long\n\n- 7 -\'\n\nenough run to acquire otherwise a suff_icient speed to lift itself.\n\nIt is secured on the platform with its tail up and is not\n\nreleased until its engine has attained full speed.\nb) Alighting.- The English, who also used airplanes over the\nsea during the war, did not hesitate to let them alight on the\nwater near ships and be lost, while saving only the pilot with\nhis iniorwation.\n\nAlighting on a ship presents many difficulties.\n\nWe know that an airplane runs a long distance on the ground, that\nthe pilot loses lateral control and that the airplane is liable to\nturn to the right or left.\nimpossible in a storm.\n\\\n\nMoreover, any accurate landing becomes\n\nIt is consequently necessary to find some\n-\n\nway to brake and steer an airplane from the moment it touches the\ndeck of a ship.\n\nIn this again Lieutenant Teste was successful.\n\nHe first perfected his method on land on a concrete platform,\nthough not without terrible accidents which would have discouraged\nmost men.\n\nHe then installed a platform on the\n\nBeal~,\n\na battleship\n\nwnich remained unfinished during the war and which was to be\ntransformed into an airplane carrier.\nOn the deck of the Bearn, to the right and to the left of the\nplatform, there are placed two rows of sand bags.\n\nIn each row,\n\nthe sand bags are connected by slack longitudinal cords.\n\nLastly,\n\nthe two rows are connected transversely by several cords slightly\nelevated above the platform.\n\nAs the airplane arrives, the pilot,\n\nwith the aid of a Sighting line, stears toward a mark placed a\nfew meters above the deck of the vessel.\n\nAs he passes over the\n\n/\n\n\\\n\nstern, he stops his engina and releases a hook under the fuselag e\nof h is airplane.\n\nThe hook catches one of the\n\nand) successively stretching all the\ncords, drags all the sand b f\'Lb Q\n\nsectio~s\n\n0:"\'2_ C c);::..l8 S\n\ntrar. s ve~se\n\ncords\n\nof the longitudinal\n\nt o a

on the Bearn\nby 16 different pilots, some of whom were novices, without the\nleast mishap.\n(Salmson\n\nz9\n\nThe swiftest airplanes at the close of the war\nand Hanriot H D 3) have often landed on it, always\n\nstopping less than 90 meters from the stern.\n\nNo foreign navy has\n\nattained like results.\nSuch is the work of the "Aviation d l Escadre,lI vrhich also\ndoes a large share of the experimenting with fire control by radiotelephony and the bombarament of ships f70m high altitudes.\nThese investigations have been so thorough that the general s t aff\ncan already foresee the possibilities of aviation and the transformations entailed in the construction OI large units.\nWe cannot conclude without recalling that all these tasks\nhave been successfully accomplished in spite of shortness of\nfunds and personnel, there being only one mechanic for two or\nthree airplanes.\n\n--------~--~--------- ~-\n\n- 9 -\n\nBoth officers and men are giving p!\'oof of their z,e al , out
