Consequently, it may be valuable if such missions can be upgraded, repaired, and/or deployed in space, either with robots or with astronauts. In response to a Request for Information from the US National Research Council panel on Science Opportunities Enabled by NASA's Constellation System, we developed a concept for astronaut-based in-space servicing at the Earth-Moon L1,2 locations that may be implemented by using elements of NASA's Constellation architecture. This libration point jobsite could be of great value for major heliospheric and astronomy missions operating at Earth-Sun Lagrange points. We explored five alternative servicing options that plausibly would be available within about a decade. We highlight one that we believe is both the least costly and most efficiently uses Constellation hardware that appears to be available by mid-next decade: the Ares I launch vehicle, Orion/Crew Exploration Vehicle, Centaur vehicle, and an airlock/servicing node developed for lunar surface operations. Our concept may be considered similar to the Apollo 8 mission: a valuable exercise before descent by astronauts to the lunar surface.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United Kingdom", "submissionId": 20080032732, "endDate": "2008-10-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "59th International Astronautical Conference/ International Astronautical Federation (IAC-08-A5.3.6)", "location": "Glasgow, Scotland", "id": "10dde3d514634338af907355ed496162", "startDate": "2008-09-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080032732, "id": "789267dee39c481ab650ac764b850563", "publicationDate": "2008-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080032732.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080032732/downloads/20080032732.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080032732/downloads/20080032732.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080032732/downloads/20080032732.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
