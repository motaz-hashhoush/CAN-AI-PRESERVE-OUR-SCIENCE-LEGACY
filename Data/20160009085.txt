Discussions of Phobos\xe2\x80\x99 and Deimos\xe2\x80\x99 origin(s) tend to feature an orthogonally opposed\npair of observations: dynamical studies which favor\ncoalescence of the moons from an orbital debris ring\narising from a large impact on Mars [1,2], and reflectance spectroscopy of the moons that indicate a carbonaceous composition that is not consistent with martian\nsurface materials [3-5]. One way to reconcile this discrepancy is to consider the option of a Mars-impact\norigin for Phobos and Deimos, followed by surficial\ndecoration of carbon-rich materials by interplanetary\ndust particle (IDP). The moons experience a high IDP\nflux because of their location in Mars\xe2\x80\x99 gravity well.\nCalculations show that accreted carbon is sufficient to\nproduce a surface with reflectance spectra resembling\ncarbonaceous chondrites.\nMars Impact Origin. An impact on Mars has been\nproposed as the origin for Phobos and Deimos [1,2].\nModels show that this scenario may explain the high\nangular momentum of the Martian system just as formation of the Moon by giant impact provides a similar\nexplanation for the Earth-Moon system. Impact formation also provides a mechanism to explain Phobos\nand Deimos\xe2\x80\x99 highly circular, equatorial orbits and the\nmoons\xe2\x80\x99 irregular shapes. Reflectance spectra of Phobos\nand Deimos indicate abundant carbon, which has been\ntaken to imply that the bulk mineralogy of the moons\nis similar to carbonaceous chondrites [3-5].\nAn Infall-Derived Carbonaceous Rind. We propose a different interpretation of the reflectance spectra\nof Phobos and Deimos. The moons lie within Mars\xe2\x80\x99\ngravity well, and so are subjected to much higher interplanetary dust particle (IDP) flux than that seen for\nasteroidal bodies. This flux is sufficient to have added\na significant amount of carbon-rich IDP material to\nPhobos\xe2\x80\x99 and Deimos\xe2\x80\x99 surfaces since their formation,\nsuch that the moons\xe2\x80\x99 reflectance spectra now strongly\nresemble carbonaceous asteroid spectra.\nFlynn [6], noting that IDP infall onto Mars is almost three times that of Earth, calculates an influx of\n12e6 kg/year, of which ~10% is carbon by mass [6].\nWe assume that the flux is the same for Phobos and\nDeimos as the moons lie within Mars\xe2\x80\x99 gravity well and\nessentially get in the way of IDP flux onto the planet.\nUsing the surface areas of Phobos, Deimos, and Mars\nas factors to calculate the portion of this infall that\nlands on the moons, we find that Phobos accretes IDP\nmaterial at a rate of 128 kg/year and Deimos at 41\n\nkg/year. If Phobos and Deimos formed 4 Ga ago [7]\nthen Phobos has accrued 5.1e11 kg of IDP material and\nDeimos 1.6e11 kg of IDP material, ~10% of which is\ncarbonaceous. If this material is retained within the top\nmeter of regolith, then the total mass of accreted IDP\nmaterial amounts to ~180x the original mass of the top\nmeter of the moons\xe2\x80\x99 regolith. Note that this value accounts for steady IDP flux only, and does not include\nperiodic meteor shower flux. Additional work is also\nneeded to ascertain the extent of mobilization and loss\nof carbonaceous material over time, but the calculations presented here indicate that there is a high likelihood that the moons should retain sufficient carbonaceous material to contribute to their reflectance spectra. Assumptions for this calculation include a constant\nIDP flux over 4 Ga, no loss of IDP mass after infall,\nand even distribution of infall mass over the surfaces\nof Phobos and Deimos. Given the total IDP mass calculated here, changes to these assumptions would have\nto be quite dramatic in order to render the accreted\nmass insignificant from a spectral standpoint.\nConclusions. For the martian moons, this finding\nindicates that carbonaceous material should constitute\na significant component in reflectance spectra, even if\nthe bulk composition of the moons\xe2\x80\x99 interiors is carbonpoor. Also, the moons\xe2\x80\x99 reflectance spectra should be\nan amalgam of the asteroid and cometary classes, as\nopposed to matching a single reflectance class, since\nthe IDP flux arises from many different bodies. Rivkin\n[5] finds significant differences between the leading\nand trailing faces of Phobos, which may indicate mobilization or ablation from Phobos\xe2\x80\x99 leading face to expose underlying, relatively carbon-depleted material.\nFor Mars, Phobos\xe2\x80\x99 and Deimos\xe2\x80\x99 surfaces are\nroughly analogous to Mars\xe2\x80\x99 regolith composition in the\nabsence of the strongly oxidizing martian surface\nchemistry. As such, the moons preserve a record of\ncarbonaceous infall onto Mars throughout its history.\nThis record has probably been lost on the planet itself\ndue to the strongly oxidizing surface environment.\nReferences: [1] Craddock R., Icarus 211 (2011)\n1150-1161.
