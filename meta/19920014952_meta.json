Historically, frequency stability has been accomplished by continuously powered, high cost, high performance reference oscillators. Today's low cost mobile satellite communication equipment must operate under wide ranging environmental conditions, stabilize quickly after application of power, and provide adequate performance margin to overcome RF link impairments unique to the land mobile environment. Methods for frequency stabilization in land mobile applications must meet these objectives without incurring excessive performance degradation. A frequency stabilization scheme utilizing the LORAN (Long Range Navigation) system is presented.", "title": "Frequency stabilization for mobile satellite terminals via LORAN", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920014952, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ernst, Gregory J."}, "organization": {"name": "Hughes Network Systems, Inc.", "location": "Germantown, MD, United States"}}, "id": "31090ac3a93f4d11b51d7cba43244b4a"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920014952, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kee, Steven M."}, "organization": {"name": "Hughes Network Systems, Inc.", "location": "Germantown, MD, United States"}}, "id": "077deffc2eea48e485b04a8c5424b16e"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920014952, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Marquart, Robert C."}, "organization": {"name": "Hughes Network Systems, Inc.", "location": "Germantown, MD, United States"}}, "id": "c4be0338cbdf4b96b8a5b41dc2747795"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920014952, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920014952, "id": "017aaa96e632473fb568bedf2aa2f0c6", "publicationName": "JPL, California Inst. of Tech., Proceedings of the 2nd International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1990)", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920014952.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920014952/downloads/19920014952.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920014952/downloads/19920014952.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920014952/downloads/19920014952.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
