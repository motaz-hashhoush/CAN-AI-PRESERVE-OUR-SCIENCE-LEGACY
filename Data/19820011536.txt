The objectives\n\nof the program are to transfer aerospace technology to the solution of\n\nimportant technological problems in public transportation, to implement\n\nand continuously refine appropriate methods of ensuring successful\n\ntransfers, and to provide visibility for program activities\n\n4\n\nThis analysis of the market for compressed television transmission\n\ntechnology was conducted as part of the SRI Team\'s highway effort.\n\nMrs. Ruth Lizak is responsible for all program activities that relate\n\nto state and local highway problems.\n\n\nV\n\nI\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nTraffic flow enhancement has been an objective of highway engineers\n\nfor many years and the reason for most highway construction. As highway\n\ntraffic increased, roadways were widened or new highways were built.\n\nToday, however, these methods of traffic flow enhancement may not be pos\xc2\xad\nsible due to limited financial resources for transportation investments,\n\nthe increased costs of highway construction, the unavailability of land,\n\nand public concern about air quality.\n\nTraffic delays caused by random events are referred to as temporary\n\nhazards or incidents. The effect of these incidents usually is the\n\nblocking of a lane or lanes on a highway, thereby creating a traffic\n\nbottleneck. The magnitude of this problem can be seen in Figure 1. The\n\nnumber of vehicles that accumulate upstream of the bottleneck depends\n\non the duration of each congestion.\n\n\nI4 \n\n\n0\n\n>\n\nDURATION OF CONGESTION\n\nDEMAND\n\n:\n\n-,I\n\nwZ\n\nCUUIMTIE\n\ntb\n\nJ\n\nFIGUE 1\nRELTIOSHIPBETEENDEMNCAPACITY \n ,ADONETN\n\n\nand vehicles will accumulate upstream of the bottleneck. The amount of delay is represented\nby the shaded area.\nSOURCE: Transportation Research Beard, "Freeway Traffic Management," September 1979\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMAND, CAPACITY, AND CONGESTION\n\nAll references are listed at the end of the report.\n\nI\n\nThe highway researcher has responded to this need for alternative\n\nmeans of alleviating highway traffic congestion by developing traffic\n\nsurveillance and control systems. To date, these systems have relied\n\nprimarily on two basic elements:\n(1) entrance ramp metering that regu\xc2\xad\nlates the rate of traffic flow onto the highway, and (2) incident detec\xc2\xad\ntion and management that eliminates the lengthy traffic stoppage or near\n\nstoppage by rapidly detecting and removing the cause (e.g., the disabled\n\nvehicle, spilled load, or traffic accident).\n\nTraffic surveillance and control systems were first tested about\n\n20 years ago. The first systems relied heavily on loop detectors that\n\nconsist of permanent magnets and imbedded coils. (A set of magnets is\n\narranged such that a unique pattern of voltage is induced in a coil within\n\nthe roadway. Passage of a vehicle interrupts the flow of current.)\n\nAdvantages of such systems included simplicity and passivity; their\n\nprimary disadvantage was the inability to transmit specific information\n\nabout the cause of the congestion.\n\nLater systems added television cameras and broadband coaxial cables\n\nto verify loop-detected problems and identify their causes. However,\n\nthe cost for coaxial cable was, and still is, high. Telephone lines\n\nwere considered for low-cost communication linkage, but the requisite\n\ncompressed television images lacked clarity. Compression of images is\n\nnecessary for telephone lines due to the small bandwidth of the lines.\n\nMost recently, the Maryland Department of Transportation (DOT)\n\nbegan plans for a television-based traffic surveillance and control\n\nsystem for the Baltimore Beltway. Television imagery will be transmitted\n\nover telephone lines. The imagery would be compressed, however, with\n\nNASA-developed technology to ensure clarity. NASA-developed error pro\xc2\xad\ntection would ensure reliability. Highly sophisticated compressed tele\xc2\xad\nvision transmission (CTT) is positionally constructed. If the image is\n\nout of synchronization, it loses its place, and thus it needs error\n\nprotection (e.g., NASA\'s powerful channel coding techniques developed\n\nfor the Jupiter mission).\n\nThis report describes NASA\'s CTT technology and considers its\n\npotential market; a market that encompasses teleconferencing, remote\n\nmedical diagnosis, patient monitoring, transit station surveillance,\n\nas well as traffic management and control. In addition, current and\n\n(other) potential television transmission systems and their costs and\n\npotential manufacturers are considered.\n\nThe market analysis was conducted at the request of the Director\n\nof NASA\'s Technology Transfer Division. The purpose of the analysis\n\nwas to assess the transferability of this NASA technology.\n\n\n2\n\n\nII\n\nCURRENT AND PROPOSED TRAFFIC SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS\n\nAND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES UNDER DEVELOPMENT\n\n\nThe first traffic surveillance and control systems were installed\n\nin the early 1970s. These systems, in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Min\xc2\xad\nneapolis, relied on magnetic loop detectors. More recent systems have\n\nincluded closed circuit television (CCTV) transmission. Some of the\n\nlater systems existing in California, Michigan, and Ontario are described,\n\nas well as the Maryland DOT\'s proposed system. This section closes\n\nwith descriptions of potential technologies for use in the future in the\n\ncontrol of traffic flow.\n\n\nMaryland Department of Transportation\n\nBoth the Washington Beltway and the Baltimore Beltway currently are\n\nequipped with telephone call boxes from which emergency aid or roadside\n\nservice may be summoned. Along both beltways, boxes are spaced at 1-mile\n\nintervals. The Baltimore Beltway also has a number of variable message\n\nsigns. (Message signs for the Washington Beltway are in the planning\n\nstage.) By responding quickly to calls for help and simultaneously\n\ndisplaying sign messages for other drivers, Maryland highway crews have\n\nattempted to alleviate incident-caused traffic congestion.\nBecause\n\nof the possible time lapse before the call box is reached, however,\n\ntraffic congestion still may be severe.\n\nThe Maryland DOT believes that a traffic surveillance system is\n\nneeded and has developed plans to install one. The system design in\xc2\xad\ncludes 60 television cameras to be located on Beltway overpasses, 3 miles\n\nof interconnected telephone cable (to be bought by Maryland), 9600-baud\n\ntelephone line (to be leased from the Bell Telephone Co.), and a data\n\ncompression capability to reduce the number of frames per second (without\n\nimage degradation) to enable the use of telephone lines.\n\n\nCalifornia Department of Transportation\n\nThe state of California has two traffic management systems partially\n\ninstalled. One system is on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge\'and the\n\nother on the Santa Monica Freeway.\n\nThe San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge traffic management system\n\nwas designed "to improve the efficiency and enhance the user benefits\n\nprovided by the (bridge\'s) tow service." 2 About 60 cars per day stall\n\non the bridge, blocking lanes and causing delays totaling 3,000 vehicle\n\nhours. An average of 3 accidents per day also occur on the bridge.\n\n3\n\n\nThe San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge traffic management system will\n\ninclude:\n\n* \t10 changeable message signs and sign controllers.\n\n* \tMagnetic loop detectors at 1,200-ft intervals in all 10 lanes\n\nof the 8-mile bridge.\n\n* \t32 call box stations.\n\n* \t12 CCTV cameras hard-wired to a ready room on Yerba Buena\n\nIsland where two pictures will be electronically selected for\n\nsimultaneous transmission to the control center.\n\n* \tAn incident detection microcomputer, with added random access\n\nmemory (RAM).\n\n* \tAn intelligent cathode ray tube (CRT) display controlled by\n\na microcomputer.\n\n* \tAbout 100,000 ft of coaxial cable.\n\nAn initial cost of $3 million for the system is estimated, exclud\xc2\xad\ning the magnetic loop detectors and call boxes that are already installed.\n\nThe cost is high--$375,000 per mile. An additional $100,000 per year\n\nfor operating and maintenance costs is anticipated. It should be noted,\n\nhowever, that a benefit-cost comparison made by the California DOT in\xc2\xad\ndicated that a $3 million saving would be realized in 10 years as a\n\nresult 6f a reduction in accidents and time delays.\n\nThe Santa Monica Freeway traffic management system in Los Angeles,\n\ndesigned to reduce rush-hour congestion and incident response time,\n\ncombines tow-service enhancement with ramp metering. This Santa Monica\n\nFreeway traffic-management system is a demonstration project. The 12\xc2\xad\nmile east-west stretch of the freeway, when complete, will contain 14\n\nsingle cameras, each having a 350-degree field of view capability and\n\n0.43-mile view range. Images will be carried by microwave transmission,\n\n20 to 60 ft above the roadway. Three channels will simultaneously pro\xc2\xad\nvide three television pictures at the control center. The system, by\n\nMotorola, will cost in excess of $1 million, including cameras and displays.\n\n\nMicrowave transmission was selected as a cost-saving feature.\n\nQuotations received for coaxial cable ranged from $30,000 to $75,000 per\n\nmile ($360,000 to $900,000 for 12 miles). A system using microwave\n\ntransmission is costed at $66,000 per mile for antenna, recievers, and\n\ntransmitters for 14 camera sites. However, microwave transmission cannot\n\nbe used in many urban areas because of the Federal Communication Commission\'s\n\n(FCC) restrictions on frequency allocations. In addition, microwave trans\xc2\xad\nmission requires straight-line links. For these reasons, the California\n\nDOT has negated plans to expand the system. (The entire freeway system in\n\nLos Angeles is approximately 600 miles long. At $66,000 per mile for\n\nmicrowave transmission, the total cost would be $39.6 million.)\n\n\n4\n\n\nGolden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District\n\nTraffic on the Golden Gate Bridge (about 2 miles long, six lanes\n\nwide) is under surveillance and control by means of a low-light-level\n\nCCTV system. The CCTV system was installed several years ago and re\xc2\xad\ncently converted to low-light-level television. Imaging data are trans\xc2\xad\nmitted by means of coaxial cable to the control center at the toll\n\nplaza. Two cameras, one on each tower, cover the entire bridge. The\n\nsystem can handle four channels, although only two are currently used.\n\nTotal cost for the system was about $80,000, most of which is in 1976\n\ndollars. The system performs well and is well accepted. Surveillance\n\nof the bridge approaches is included in near-future plans.\n\nImportant to the Golden Gate system is a fleet of tow trucks owned\n\nand operated by the District. Response to traffic incidents is rapid\n\nand effective.\n\n\nMichigan Department of Transportation\n\nThe traffic surveillance system in Detroit is primarily an elec\xc2\xad\ntronic loop detector system although some televising capability exists.\n\nOn the Edsel Ford Freeway (1-94), detectors are buried in all six lanes,\n\nevery 1/3 mile, on 14 miles of highway. Smaller loop detector systems\n\nhave been installed on the Chrysler Freeway (1-75 and 1-375) and the John\n\nLodge Freeway (U.S. 10). Only 1-94 has telephone call-boxes, also located\n\nevery 1/3 mile, and four television cameras at two locations (the 1-375\n\nand the U.S. 10 intersections). Eight additional camera sites are planned,\n\nfor a total of 12. Michigan has avoided complex and expensive ramp meter\xc2\xad\ning systems. Detroit\'s simple ramp meters operate at one speed only\n\n(5-sec intervals) regardless of the time of day or the traffic volume on\n\nthe freeway.\n\nEmergency information is relayed to the freeway driver by means\n\nof variable message signs that are attached to the overpasses. Coaxial\n\ncables carry all signals. (The largest single expense to Michigan was\n\nthe labor cost for digging trefiches and laying the coaxial cable.)\n\nTraffic abnormalities are discerned by the computer, which alerts the\n\noperator at the Control Center by means of four TV displays.\n(Eight\n\nadditional displays have been installed for future use.)\n\nSystem components and their manufacturers are identified in Table 1.\n\nCost for the entire system was $15 million in 1979, or about $469,000 per\n\nmile, including the variable message signs and loop detectors. The\n\ncost of the coaxial cable, including installation, exceeded $100,000\n\nper mile.\n\n\nOntario Ministry of Transportation\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth Freeway in the vicinity of Toronto, Canada\n\nhas a traffic surveillance and control system that was designed in-house\n\n5\n\n\nTable I\n\nCOMPONENTS OF THE DETROIT TRAFFIC SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM\n\nComponent\n\nManufacturer\n\nModel Number or Description\n\nLoop detectors\n\nCanoga\n\nNo. 402 and 404\n\nTelemetry\n\nTocom\n\nSpecially modified equipment\n\nCoaxial cable\n\nGeneral cable\n\nFused 3/4 inch type II\n\nTV cameras\n\nDiamond\n\nB/W, LLL, 16-160 mm, zoom\xc2\xad\ntilt-pan\n\nField modulators\n\nTocom\n\n5-30 MHz\n\nRamp controller\n\nSiklos\n\nCustom-made\n\nTV monitors\n\nPanasonic\nSony\n\n17 inches\n22 inches\n\nComputers (2)\n\nPerkin-Elmer\n\nNo. 832\n\nLine amplifiers\n\nRCA\n\nNo. 152\n\nVideo cassette tape\nrecorder\n\nGyrr\n\nModified time lapse; 50-216\nMHz\n\nColorgraphic projector\nand display\n\nRamtek\n\nin 1974 to give ministry staff in-depth expertise in traffic surveillance\n\ntechnology. The system includes low-light-level CCTV. The entire system\n\nconsists of 5 cameras, spaced a little less than 1 mile apart, 5\n\nmicroprocessor-based ramp metering controls, 15 ramp and mainline in\xc2\xad\nduction loops, a central computer, a CRT graphic display, and a single\n\nbroadband coaxial cable that is strung overhead. The system covers a\n\n3.9-mile stretch of highway on the southern approach of Toronto. The\n\nhighway contains three lanes in each direction.\n\nOntario has found the CCTV system to be a valuable tool for traffic\n\nand incident management, particularly because of close interaction with\n\npolice. (The control center is located in a local police facility.)\n\nPublic reaction to the system has been favorable. Early adverse reactions\n\nwere related to the ramp metering which ostensibly was inequitable to\n\nthe Toronto area residents during morning rush hours because their en\xc2\xad\ntrance onto the highway was constrained by current traffic flow. This\n\ncomplaint proved to be unfounded in that all ramp meters were adjusted\n\nwhen traffic flow slowed downstream.\n\nFailures in the system have been minimal. Usually the cause of\n\nthe failures was poor maintenance. In general, the Queen Elizabeth\n\nFreeway system has been well received by the Ministry and the public,\n\nand expansion of the system is planned.\n\n6\n\nHigh costs have not been considered a disadvantage to date.\n\nIt\n\n\nshould be noted, however, that the Toronto system is small--smaller\n\nthan the system on the San Frnacisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. As the system\n\nis expanded, the high cost of coaxial cable may become an issue.\n\n\nRelated Technologies Under Development\n\nConditional Replenishment\n\nA search of the United States Patent index revealed one patent,\n\nin addition to the NASA-JPL patent, that relates to traffic surveillance\n\nsystems or to surveillance-types of telecommunications systems that\n\ncould be applied to traffic surveillance. Issued in 1971, the patent\n\ndescribes an asynchronous time division multiplexing system for use with\n\ntelevision signals ("Time Division Multiplexing of Video Redundancy Re\xc2\xad\nduction Data Compressors," U.S. Patent 3,584,145, assigned to Bell\n\nTelephone Laboratories, Inc.). The primary objective of the invention\n\nis to reduce the time required for processing television signals and\n\nhence eliminate the extended interval for inactive images. The buffer\n\nmemory in each redundancy reduction data compressor is asynchronously\n\ntime-division-multiplexed to a transmission channel. The buffer memory\n\nstores, a sample from a television signal only when that sample differs\n\nby more than a threshold value from a corresponding previously stored\n\nsample having the same time position in a television frame. The tech\xc2\xad\nnique is now known as conditional replenishment.\n\nUnderstandably, Bell Laboratories has a continuing interest in the\n\ntransmission of television signals over conventional telephone lines.\n\nIn 1980, Bell announced a new technique, 3 called motion-compensated\n\ncoding, which takes conditional replenishment one step further. Motion\n\nwithin a scene is estimated and then compared with successive frames\n\nthat are spatially displaced by that motion. If the estimate is accu\xc2\xad\nrate, the intensity difference between the original point and the point\n\nto which the object has moved is less than the intensity difference\n\nat the same location of the two successive frames; consequently, less\n\ninformation is needed for transmission. Thus, less information (1.5\n\nmillion bits per second compared with 64 million bits per second for\n\nstandard television) is needed for transmission. According to Bell re\xc2\xad\nsearchers, motion-compensated coding provides a picture that is "accept\xc2\xad\nable for videoconferencing, but not for television transmission where\n\nexcessive motion is evident." Excessive motion, such as that seen on\n\nhighways, causes a blurring of the picture.\n\n\nFiber Optics\n\nFiber optics has attracted considerable attention as a means of\n\ntelevision transmission. The state of the art has reached the level\n\nof maturity necessary for application to traffic surveillance and con\xc2\xad\ntrol. With fiber optics, light instead of electricity is used to\n\ntransmit voice and video images by bundles of fine glass fibers. Images\n\n7\n\n\nare converted/coded into pulses of light at the rate of 44.7 megabits/\n\nsec. The fibers carry laser signals over long distances; for short\n\ndistances, light-emiting diodes (LEDs) are used.\n\nFiber optics is applied primarily to point-to-point information\n\ntransmission through a high bandwidth (potentially higher than microwave\n\nradio), low-loss medium. For the 1980s, the high bandwidth promises a\n\ncapability for integration of multiple communications on one fiber.\n\nInitial capital costs for fiber optic systems also are expected to be\n\nhigh.\n\nThe largest near-term market for fiber optics is the telephone.\n\nIn fact, several developers of integrated data transceivers already offer\n\nfiber optic links as features within existing product lines. Although\n\nhandled in a manner similar to coaxial cable rather than twisted-pair\n\ncable, the optical cable can be buried, acrially mounted, or ducted.\n\nImprovements, however, are still needed in both instrumentation and\n\ntechniques. Further development of laser sources, photodetectors, and\n\noptical couplers is needed according to the Harris Government Informa\xc2\xad\ntion Systems Division of Melbourne, Florida. 4 Companies such as AMP,\n\nIncorporated of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania are making progress in develop\xc2\xad\ning fiber optic connectors that overcome the coupling mismatch problem.\n\n(Mismatches between light sources, detectors, and fibers can sap optical\n\ntransmission power.)\n\nOf note is AT&T\'s limited use of fiber optics to date. Currently,\n\nonly one telephone system includes fiber optics: Within the Bell system\n\nin Chicago, 144 fibers can transmit 50,000 telephone conversations (not\n\ntelevision) simultaneously.5 Manufacturers of fibers for video trans\xc2\xad\nmission included Belden Corporation whose cables are incorporated into\n\nthe Sperry Univac video frequency data link for the city of Houston.\n\nThe fiber optics link a management information system (MIS) computer\n\nin Houston\'s Municipal Courts Building with 5 video terminals in the\n\nmain library more than 10 miles away. Honeywell has joined with Du Pont\n\nand ITT Cannon to produce HDC (Honeywell-DuPont-Cannon) interface com\xc2\xad\nponents. Although 2 years older than the HDC, Belden fiber optics can\n\nclaim many advantages (see Table 2).5 Motorola\'s fiber optic ferrule\n\nsemiconductor fits into AMP\'s connector for efficient optical coupling.\n\nOther companies include RCA, 3M, Tektronics, Bell & Howell, Hewlett-\n\nPackard, Orionics, and Laser Diode.\n\nThe market to dat\' for fiber optic systems has resided almost\n\nexclusively in custom-designed components to be integrated into exist\xc2\xad\ning nonoptic systems such as standard telephone lines. Users have in\xc2\xad\ncluded manufacturers of telecommunications systems; Army, Navy, and\n\nMarine facilities; transportation agencies; utility companies; financial\n\ninstitutions; libraries; and oil refineries. Sales in 1979 approached\n\n$13 million, primarily for voice transmission.\n\nCosts for fiber optic systems range from $2 to $5 per foot in lots\n\nof 1,000, or $10,400 to $26,400 per mile, plus an initial cost of $50,000\n\nto $100,000 for repeaters and other equipment. 6 It should be noted\n\n8\n\n\nthat fiber optics requires costly trench installation, similar to that\n\nof coaxial cable.\n\n\nTable 2\n\nCOMPARISON OF BELDEN AND HDC FIBER OPTICS\n\n\n1978 Belden Fiber Optic Advantage \n\n\n1980 HDC Fiber Optic Advantage\n\n\nSmall size and light weight \n\n\nLight weight and small dimension\n\n\nFlexibility and high strength \n\n\nCabl flexibility compared with\n\nwire\n\n\nLarge bandwidth for size and \n\nweight\n\n\nData rates to 30 Mb per sec\n\n\nLonger cable runs between re-\n\npeaters\n\n\nOptical path lengths to 30 meters\n\n\nElectromagnetic, crosstalk im-\n\nmunity \n\n\nImmunity to electromagnetic inter\xc2\xad\nference\n\n\nNuclear radiation resistant \n\n\nUse standard electrical connectors\n\n\nNo electrical hazard, cut, damaged \n Simple fiber termination at diode\n\nconnector\n\nPotential high-temperature opera-\n\ntion \n\n\nCompatible with high-density\n\npackaging\n\n\nNo arcing in combustible atmo-\n\n\nTTL and CMOS compatible output\n\n\nsphere\n\n\nNo ground loop or short circuit \n\n\nCost less than existing fiber\n\n\nproblem \n\n\noptic links\n\nImmunity to lightning discharge \n\n\nHDC interface requires little\nextra design\n\nNote:\n\nSource:\n\n-\n\nEntries taken nearly verbatim from Belden and HDC statements.\n\n\nReference 6\n\n\nDiscussions with traffic and research engineers in several states,\n\nhowever, revealed a reluctance to trust fiber optics. The problem re\xc2\xad\nlates primarily to the industry, which according to California DOT engi\xc2\xad\n\nneers is not ready.\n\nThese engineers will not consider investing in a\n\n\nfiber optics system until the manufacturers are well established and\n\n\nhave interchangeable equipment, a condition not expected for many years.\n\nAccording to these same engineers, the injection lasers and receivers\n\nof different manufacturers have different performance criteria with\n\nregard to temperature sensitivity and other parameters.\n\n\n9\n\n\nFurther discussions with the California DOT engineers revealed a\n\ncessation of interest in any microwave technology, with or without satel\xc2\xad\nlite links, because of the high cost--more than $50,000 per mile--and\n\nthe licensing requirements. The long waiting period for an updated\n\npicture was the primary strike against slow scan television transmission.\n\n\n10\n\n\nIII\n\nNASA\'S COMPRESSED TELEVISION TRANSMISSION\n\n\nThe NASA-JPL CTT technology is based on a space communications\n\nsystem that incorporates a concatenated Reed-Solomon-Viterbi coding\n\nchannel [U.S. Patent 3,988,677 awarded to NASA (R. F. Rice) on October\n\n26, 19761. The space system transmits compressed data from a space\xc2\xad\ncraft to a data processing center on eath. Imaging data are compressed\n\ninto source blocks that are coded by a Reed-Solomon coder and inter\xc2\xad\nleaver and a convolutional encoder. A Viterbi decoding is followed by\n\na Reed-Solomon decoding and deinterleaving. The output is then decom\xc2\xad\npressed and processed to reconstruct the original image. The primary\n\nbenefit of this on-site coding is significant error reduction. The\n\npatent is provided in full as Appendix A.\n\nTwo additional efforts by R. F.

Appendix C provides a paper that describes the NASA-\n\nJPL rate-controlled image data compression developed for the Galileo\n\norbiter mission of Jupiter.\n\nThe proposed NASA traffic surveillance system transmits television\n\nimages over telephone line digital data links by means of a low-cost\n\ndata compressor/decompressor with error protection coding. The system\n\nconsists of 7 components: 2 at the television camera site (the code\n\ncomputer and semiconductor, plus the camera), 4 at the control center\n\n(decoder minicomputer, video digitizer, display driver, television\n\nmonitor), and 1 between sites (the modum to the telephone line).\n(See\n\nFigure 2.)\nEach interface unit will handle two-way communication between\n\nthe camera site and the center.

The operator is given\n\ngreat flexibility to adapt the rate/fidelity priorities.

The system is compatible\n\nwith a videcon camera and will be compatible with a solid-state, charged\n\ncoupled device (CCD) for imaging in the future.\n\nBlock coding is used to enable error correction (not just detection)\n\nat the receiver end. Each block is coded; the decoder corrects errors\n\nmade in transmission.\n\nThe data compression algorithm is rate-controlled. By accepting\n\ndegradation of image quality (i.e., some blurring), the operator can\n\nobtain high frame rates. The slower the frame rate, the better the image\n\nquality. Good quality is possible at speeds of 3 see per frame. (See\n\nFigures 3 and 4.) Acceptable quality is possible at 1 sec per frame.\n\nA comparison of compressed television imaging with slow-scan averaging\n\nis provided in Figure 5.\n\n-QUALITY VERSUS FRAME RATE\n\nQUALITY\n\nCURRENT\n\n~SLOW\n\nEXACT\n\nSCAN-\\,\n\nFAIR 60*I\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nSECONDS PER FRAME\nSOURCE JPL\nFIGURE 3\n\nFRAME RATE VERSUS QUALITY TRADE-OFF\n\nThe use of telephone lines for data transmission should mean much\n\nlower costs.

Therefore, anything\n\nthat needs to be watched is potentially a candidate for CTT. The\n\napplications discussed below are the applications that will likely\n\nbenefit by use of the system today. Many other applications may sur\xc2\xad\nface, however, as the system\'s unit cost decreases and as the cost of\n\nlabor that can be replaced by the system increases.\n\nThe CTT system is being developed by JPL specifically for highway\n\ntraffic surveillance. From discussions with several major manufacturers\n\n(i.e., Nippon Electric Corporation, Robot, TRW, Colorado Video, and Dalmo\n\nVictor), traffic surveillance appears to be an excellent application of\n\nthe system and should prove to be very beneficial, but it is not neces\xc2\xad\nsarily the best application. The two applications that appear to have\n\na high potential for CTT use are business teleconferencing and remote\n\n\nmedical diagnosis.\n\n\nTeleconferencing\n\nSeveral businesses already have leased slow-scan systems (78 sec/\n\nframe). They have all experienced the same problem with existing systems:\n\nthe slow system rate takes some adjustment. In some cases, the business\xc2\xad\nmen adjusted well to the system. In other cases, the men were unable\n\nto adjust and consequently rejected the system. The primary objection\n\n\nwas the long waiting period for an updated picture.\n\nThe NASA/JPL CTT\n\n\nsystem (1-3 sec/frame) is expected to eliminate that concern. It should\n\nbe noted, however, that systems approaching real-time (1/30 sec/frame)\n\nare being commercially produced. Compression Labs Inc. is marketing\n\nsuch a system, but it requires a special high-bandwidth telephone line\n\nat a monthly rental cost of about $40,000.\n\nThe use of CTT in business teleconferencing is very promising.\n\nThe increasing burden of travel on management is causing the major\n\ncorporations to seek alternatives. ARCO recently announced plans for a\n\n$20 million video conferencing network that will offer one or more of\n\nthe following capabilities at 110 of its offices: electronic mail,\n\nfacsimile transmission of documents, computer-to-computer data trans\xc2\xad\nmission, as well as video conferencing.\n\nVideo teleconferencing will unquestionably be cost-effective for\n\nat least the top 500 companies in the United States according to Richard\n\nF. Bader, President of Compression Labs Inc. His statement is in refer\xc2\xad\nence to systems costing $60,000 to $300,000 per pair.\n\n\n15\n\n\nIf the cost can be reduced by an order of magnitude by a cost\xc2\xad\nreducing compression system, the overall market for business telecom\xc2\xad\nmunications would be even more. The limiting factor in its widespread\n\nuse may be disgruntled middle managers. From a recent survey of 1,000\n\nmiddle managers, Gnostic Concepts Inc., a Menlo Park consulting Firm,\n\nconcluded that this group of managers will object vehemently to video\n\nconferencing. According to industry experts, resistance will arise\n\nbecause employees still associate travel with status and view it as a\n\nhigher value to the corporation. On the other hand, Paul Snyder, vice\n\npresident responsible for the new network at ARCO, is convinced that\n\nonce ARCO managers become aware of what the system can do, most of them\n\nwill not only accept it, but also find new ways to use it.\n\nSRI has made a conservative estimate that a market exists for 750\n\ntelecommunications systems.\n\nRemote Medical Diagnosis\n\nRemote medical diagnosis is being used successfully in Canada.\n\nWith a slow-scan system, Canadian doctors are now able to visually\n\ndiagnose patients who live in remote areas, close to a teleconferencing\n\ncenter, but hundreds of miles from any hospital. This type of service\n\ncould become a valuable medical tool if extended to all hospitals. Rare\n\nor baffling diseases could be diagnosed by experts across the country.\n\nIn fact, X rays and even microscopy are being transmitted successfully\n\nby today\'s slower systems (transmission rates of 78-150 sec/frame)\n\nbetween 25 to 50 hospitals and approximately 300 radiologists in the\n\nU.S.\n\nApproximately 7,000 hospitals operate in the United States today.\n\nThe use of a teleconferencing system, at least for sending X rays in\n\nmany of these hospitals is likely. Once this use is proved to be cost\xc2\xad\neffective, many other hospital applications should be possible.\n\nPatient Monitoring\n\nIntrahospital use is another hospital application for video monitor\xc2\xad\ning as many patients need continuous observation. Either a standard,\n\nreal-time, closed-circuit system or the CTT system could significantly\n\nreduce hospital costs. To decide which system to use, a cost-benefit\n\nanalysis for each hospital should be done. Currently, sitters are\n\nemployed to watch patients in their rooms. No more than two patients\n\nare assigned per room; theoretically, therefore, two is the maximum\n\nnumber of patients a sitter can watch. However, the severe shortage of\n\nnurses and the high financial burdens necessitate that hospitals use\n\none sitter for two rooms, but vigilance of the patients is thereby\n\nreduced.\n\n\n16\n\n\nHospitals are currently using closed-circuit video monitors for\n\n\nonly three purposes: security of the miles of hallways, observation of\n\npsychologically disturbed patients, and education. San Francisco General\n\nHospital illustrates the potential for this application. The hospital\n\nhas 500 staffed beds (generally 70% occupancy), 300 registered nurses,\n\n100 licensed nurses, and 100 orderlies. A hospital this size has many\n\npatients that require constant observation: approximately 10-15 patients\n\nmust be watched for suicide precaution, about 20 criminal patients are\n\nunder security by policemen, and 10-15 patients in the intensive care\n\nunit must have a nurse on hand at all times. All of these patients\n\nare now-watched by sitters or nurses. Yet, except for those in inten\xc2\xad\nsive care (these patients need constant treatment until their condition\n\nstabilizes), all could be monitored remotely. Therefore, 40-50 patients,\n\nor about 15% of all patients, could be observed by the CTT system.\n\nThe primary objection to use of a video system in hospitals (other\n\nthan financial) is the lack of human contact and the unnerving feeling\n\npatients may have from being watched by a camera. This should be a\n\nserious consideration for only the suicidal patients; the others are\n\ngenerally unconscious and would not be adversely affected by remote\n\nobservation.\n\nContrary to expected good interhospital use, however, intrahospital\n\napplications are not very promising. The CTT system is at best only\n\nmarginally cost-effective compared with bedside personnel costs, even\n\nin the large hospitals such as San Francisco General. As such, few\n\nhospitals will use the system for observation purposes. Only an in\xc2\xad\ncrease in the nurse shortage would cause the hospitals to use the sys\xc2\xad\ntem. It is important to note that this pessimistic view of the hospital\n\nas a potential market for CTT is only an early indication. A complete\n\ncost-benefit analysis for hospitals should still be done, especially if\n\nthe hospital is interested in the system for remote medical diagnosis.\n\n\nEducation\n\nThe CTT could also have many educational applications. Lectures\n\ncould be transmitted from major universities to companies around the\n\ncountry, industries could visually demonstrate a process or technique\n\nto interested people nationwide, and doctors could more easily promote\n\nmedical advances and breakthroughs in surgical techniques. Essentially,\n\nany educational or training service, instead of being limited to local\n\npeople could be expanded to serve people anywhere.\n\nAccording to Mr. Robert Kinchlow, director of Stanford University\'s\n\ntelecommunications, however, the CTT system will have a very small\n\nmarket in the educational field. Although there is a real need for\n\ncontinuing education in industry, that need is being satisfactorily\n\nfilled. For example, Stanford lectures are transmitted throughout the\n\nBay Area by microwaves and distributed throughout the nation on video\n\ntapes. The only limitation to video tapes is for case study courses;\n\n17\n\n\nhowever, in this situation, real-time monitoring is more desirable than\n\na slow scan system anyway.\n\nDefense\n\nA major user of the CTT system may be the military. In addition\n\nto the numerous air fields and bases that the military would like to\n\nobserve more closely, many remote sites also must be guarded that have\n\nno personnel on hand. To guard these remote sites, the military is\n\nusing low-bandwidth sensors that tend to generate many false alarms.\n\nThe cost of reacting to these false alarms is excessive. Reducing\n\nfalse alarms by the use of a visual transmission of the site should re\xc2\xad\nsult in significant cost savings. Approximately 250 military bases in\n\nthe United States could benefit from CTT surveillance.\n\nTraffic Management and Control\n\nDiscussions were held with representatives of 11 state highway de\xc2\xad\npartments. Table 3 lists the 11 departments, their current systems, and\n\ninterest in NASA\'s CTT. Nine of the 11 expressed varying degrees of\n\ninterest in the NASA system. The remaining two have no interest in any\n\ntraffic surveillance system due to budgetary constraints. Many depart\xc2\xad\nments believe that the future of the NASA system will be determined by\n\nthe cities where traffic congestion is most severe. The application most\n\noften mentioned was the interstate highway that approaches or penetrates\n\na metropolitan area. Of primary interest to all departments is the\n\nsystem\'s combination of a high frame rate and low cost.\n\nProjecting to all states the degree of interest in CTT for traffic\n\nmanagement indicated from a survey of 11 states gives an estimate of\n\nthe total market. That is, 9 of the 11 states surveyed indicated a\n\npotential market, and those markets represented 1 to 4 systems each (an\n\naverage of 1.3 systems per state); therefore, the total potential market\n\ncould be 53 systems. The high cost for a traffic management system given\n\nas the reason many states have installed no system to date should be\n\nalleviated with the NASA CTT and further strengthen the market projection.\n\nEmergency Traffic Management\n\nEmergency management might also benefit from traffic surveillance\n\nand control. Interest has been expressed by at least one emergency\n\nresponse unit. California\'s Office of Emergency Services realizes that\n\nthe major highways and arterials must be unblocked to ensure escape\n\nroutes for civil defense units or in case of a natural disaster such as\n\nan earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption. The state has already begun\n\nan informal investigation of surveillance techniques, but this market\n\nis too uncertain to estimate a sales figure.\n\n\n18\n\n\nTable 3\nTRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN USE AND INTEREST IN CTT\n\nIN SELECTED STATE HIGHWAY DEPARTMENTS\n\nPotential\n\nState DOT\n\nInterest\nin CTT\n\nCurrent Systems\n\nComments\n\nConnecticut\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nBudget constraints\n\nKansas\n\nNone\n\nYes\n\nPotential need in 2\nurban areas\n\nKentucky\n\nNone\n\nYes\n\nNew Jersey\n\nInductive loop system\non New Jersey Turn\xc2\xad\npike\n\nYes\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNone\n\nYes\n\nNew York\n\nCCTV in Hudson River\ntunnels, inductive\nloop system planned\nfor Long Island\n\nYes\n\nOklahoma\n\nNone\n\nNo\n\nOregon\n\nNone\n\nYes\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNone\n\nYes\n\nPotential needs exist\non 4 major highways\n\nTexas\n\nCCTV in Houston\n\nYes\n\nHouston system in\xc2\xad\noperative due to cable\nproblems\n\nWashington\n\nCCTV in Seattle\n\nYes\n\nSystem expansion\nplanned\n\n19\n\n\nWould like additional\ninformation\n\nAirport Surveillance\n\nAccidents on airstrips and at airport ramps are not uncommon. Whether\n\nan accident results from the collision of two aircraft or of an aircraft\n\nand a maintenance vehicle, the loss of time and dollars is high. NASA and\n\nSRI believed that many airport accidents could be aborted if television\n\nsurveillance systems were installed. Therefore, contacts were made with\n\nairport officials of six states-to determine potential interest in tele\xc2\xad\nvision surveillance of airports, particularly compressed television trans\xc2\xad\nmission. The responses are documented below.\n\n0 \t California has some interest in a surveillance system to monitor\n\ntraffic volumes, according to the Deputy Chief of the Aeronautics\nDivision. However, budget constraints negate any near-future\n\nplans.\n* \tConnecticut\'s Manager of Airport Operations expressed an interest\n\nin after-the-fact accident monitoring and in detecting foreign\n\nobjects, but questioned the advisability of telephone line\n\ntransmission.\n\n* \tIn Georgia, a concern was expressed regarding radio frequency\n\navailability to relay warnings to aircraft and maintenance\n\npersonnel. The frequency at Atlanta International Airport has\n\nabout reached the point of overloading.\n\no \tThe Ohio Division of Aviation believes that the value of a\nvision surveillance system would be limited to documenting\nevents leading to an accident for use at public hearings.\nfact, acceptance by the pilots\' unions of any surveillance\nis considered doubtful.\n\n\ntele\xc2\xad\nthe\n\nIn\n\nsystem\n\n\n* \tIn Pennsylvania, television surveillance is viewed by the Bureau\n\nof Aviation\'s Airports\' Engineer as an effective security measure,\n\nparticularly for remote areas of the airfield, but is not\n\nconsidered effective for accident prevention.\n\no \t\nAccording to Chicago\'s Chief of Airport Operations, ramp and\n\nairfield surveillance would not be cost-effective at the O\'Hare\n\nand Midway Airports. Both airports have configurations that\n\nwould require the installation of many television cameras. As an\n\nadded dis-incentive, airport telephone lines already transmit\n\nweather data as well as the data collected by all airport instru\xc2\xad\nments. Line capacity has been reached.\n\n\nFrom the above documentation, SRI has concluded that a market for\ncompressed television transmission for airport/airfield surveillance would\nbe small--limited to accident documentation in those airports having the\napproval of the local pilots\' union and to remote airstrip surveillance.\n\n20\n\n\nTransit Station Surveillance\n\nA study conducted by Dunlap and Associates, Inc. for the Transporta\xc2\xad\ntion Systems Center* revealed that closed circuit television (CCTV) systems\n\nhave been installed in many transit stations. Some have been connected to\n\nautomatic sensor alarm networks and automatic response capabilities, such\n\nas remotely controlled gates and locks for both safety and security. The\n\npresence of the cameras has contributed to increased ridership due to\n\npassenger confidence in station safety.\n\nTransit station environments (e.g., low light, vibration, dirt and\n\ndust, electrical power and moisture) present special problems for CCTV\n\nhardware. Cameras and video-signal transmission lines must be selected\n\nand located with these environmental factors in mind.\n\nProperties that have station surveillance systems include the Bay\n\nArea Rapid Transit District (BART) in San Francisco/Oakland, the Chicago\n\nTransit Authority, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MTA)\n\nin Boston, and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority\n\n(SEPTA) in Philadelphia. Telephone interviews were held with representatives\n\nof the four properties.\n\nAll BART stations are equipped with television surveillance systems.\n\nImages are transmitted by means of coaxial cable. BART officials reportedly\n\nhave expressed concern over the high cost of coaxial cable and would be\n\ninterested in telephone line transmission, provided image clarity and\n\ntransmission time are satisfactory.\n\nPhiladelphia began installing television surveillance systems in its\n\nstations in 1976. The Authority has approximately 40 stations, 3 of\n\nwhich are currently equipped with slow scan TV cameras (as many as 25 per\n\nstation) and one-way audio communication. Images are transmitted by means\n\nof telephone lines. Plans are under way to provide television surveillance\n\nin 20-30 stations, and a contract has been let to Westinghouse.\n\nChicago has 2 broadband television surveillance systems, with coaxial\n\ncable image transmission, serving less than 10 transit stations. One\n\nsystem has an 8-mile distribution on 70 channels.\n(Maximum capability is\n120 channels.)\nTwo-way audio communication with troubled passengers is\npossible by means of 4,000 speakers within the stations. The cameras zoom\n\nin to the site of the communication initiator. The central monitor is\n\ninstalled at the Chicago Police Department headquarters. Although costs\n\nare high, Chicago appreciates the systems and is looking forward to providing\n\ntelevision surveillance in all 140 stations by 1990.\n\n*Bloom, Richard F., "Closed Circuit Television in Transit Stations: Appli\xc2\xad\ncations Guidelines, "Dunlap and Associates, Inc., Darien, Connecticut,\n\nReport No. UMTA-MA-06-0048-80-5, August 1980\n\n\n21\n\n\nIn Boston, only one station has been equipped with a closed circuit\n\ntelevision surveillance system (wthcoaxial cable transmission). Braintree\n\nStation was opened in 1979 on the MBTA\'s newly expanded railway. CCTV\n\nsurveillance was included in the Federal construction specifications.\n\nInterest\nCentral controls are located at the Braintree Police Department.\nall stations is high; however, because of budgetary constraints,\n\nis equipping\nCCTV installations are not included in current plans.\n\nA brief call was made to the Office of the Director of Safety of the\n\nNew York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), which is testing television\n\nsurveillance systems at two stations. (NYCTA is by far the largest transit\n\nproperty in the United States with 458 stations, including 265 subway\n\nstations.) A determination of performance and user satisfaction appears\n\nto be premature. Cost savings would certainly be of interest, however,\n\nsince here again budgetary constraints are real.\n\nBased on information acquired from the five above-mentioned transit\n\nproperties, SRI has concluded that a sizeable market exists for television\n\nsurveillance of transit stations. Each of the properties expressed a\n\ndesire to provide a surveillance capability at its stations. Budgetary\n\nconstraints appear to be the primary limiting factor. \n With the decreased\n\ncost of compressed television transmission, the constraints may be\n\neliminated in some cases.\n\nThe resulting market, including existing properties and planned\n\nproperties and property expansion, could be as large as 820 stations by\n\n1990:\n\n456 \t NYCTA\n\n132 \t CTA\n\n57\n\nMBTA\n\n\n15\n40\n\nSEPTA\nWashington Metropolitan\n\nArea Transit Authority\n\n(expanded system)\n\nBART (expanded system)\n\n20\n\n100 \tNew properties in Baltimore, Miami,\n\nand other cities\n\n820\n\n\n22\n\n\nV\n\nPOTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS\n\n\nThe SRI Team contacted five manufacturers of slow-scan television\n\nsystems to determine their interest in the NASA/JPL CTT technology.\n\nAll of them expressed considerable interest in it.\n\nRobot Corporation, San Diego, CA sells slow-scan systems exclu\xc2\xad\nsively. It has been in the business since 1969, has 30 employees,\n\nsells 200 units per month, and generates about $2 million gross per\n\nyear. The company has systems that transmit at between 2-70 sec/frame\n\nat varying degrees of clarity. The standard transmission of 256 x 256\n\nlines takes 35 see. President David Smith believes that Robot is by\n\nfar the most capable slow-scan producer, with better systems and far\n\ngreater sales volume than any other commercial company in the country.\n\nMr. Smith does not believe that compression of the transmission will be\n\ncost-effective for 5-10 years, but is extremely interested in any tech\xc2\xad\nnical development.\n\nThe Broadcast Division of Nippon Electric Corp. (NEC), Poway, CA\n\nhas 50 employees and sells two systems. NEC has an analog system on an\n\nFV carrier that requires 30 see/frame of information and a digital\n\ncolor system that delivers 4.8 kilobytes of information in 150 sec\n\nover a standard voice-grade telephone line with no loss of resolution.\n\nNEC\'s digital system can send 1.54 megabytes in real time, with some\n\ndegradation of quality. The company has sold about 10 large systems\n\nto such organizations as NASA, Ford, and IBM. Nippon is aware and\n\nconfident that a market exists, especially in teleconferencing and as a\n\nmedical tool.\n\nColorado Video in Denver, established in 1965, has 40 employees\n\nand has sold about 90 slow-scan television systems in the past 13 years.\n\nThe slow-scan system is the primary product. Prices range between\n\n$11,000 and $22,000. The Colorado Video system uses no compression\n\nand as such achieves about the maximum transmission rate of 78 sec/frame\n\nover the voice-grade telephone lines. As reported, Colorado Video sees\n\n\na market in the following areas:\n\nremote medical diagnosis, business\n\n\nteleconferencing, educational transmission to remote locations, and\n\nsecurity of remote sites. Colorado Video is the main competitor of\n\nRobot according to Robot\'s president.\n\nDalmo Victor, Belmont, CA produces many instruments for military\n\napplications and until recently produced slow-scan television equipment.\n\n\nIt has recently become interested in JPL\'s CTT system and would like to\n\nsee a simulation to determine how well the system works.\n\n\n23\n\n\nThe Electronic Systems Division of TRW in Redondo Beach, CA is\n\nengaged in the "creative," early development of advanced image process\xc2\xad\ning systems. TRW is investigating slow-scan systems mostly for military\n\napplications because all of its work is under government contract. It\n\ndoes no commercial marketing of products.\n\n\n24\n\n\nVT\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAlthough still small in number, television-based traffid surveil\xc2\xad\nlance systems are growing in favor with highway engineers. Since the\n\nmid-1970s, all new installations have included television transmission.\n\nImaging data are transmitted by coaxial cable at a cost of $30,000 to\n\n$75,000 per mile of highway, depending on labor costs, or by microwave\n\nat a cost of $50,000 per mile. A need for a reduction of data transmis\xc2\xad\nsion costs has directed attention to the use of telephone lines. Clarity\n\nof the imaging data that must be compressed to accommodate telephone\n\nline digital data links, however, has been sacrificed as has fast trans\xc2\xad\nmission time. NASA\'s data compression/decompression technology with\n\nerror protection coding, developed at JPL for a space communications\n\nsystem, promises to overcome the problem of image degradation and thereby\n\nmake possible a transmission cost of less than $10,000 per mile.\n\nTo ensure commercial viability of the NASA-developed system, the\n\nmarket must not be limited to traffic surveillance. A survey of poten\xc2\xad\ntial users revealed a large market for teleconferencing equipment to\n\nreplace slow-scan systems (78 sec/frame), for medical equipment to\n\nmonitor patients and enable remote diagnoses, and for surveillance of\n\nremote military sites.\n\nSRI believes that the maximum 10-year market projection for CTT\n\nsystems derived from its survey of potential users, would be about 5,390.\n\nThis projection represents about 3,500 hospitals, 70 urban areas, 750\n\ncoporations, 820-transit stations, plus 250 military sites. A more\n\nrealistic projection would be 539 systems, i.e., 10% of the maximum.\n\nCosts should range between $20,000 to $600,000 depending on size, with an\n\naverage cost of about $50,000. Thus, sales expectancy for 10 years would\n\nbe $27 million, or $2.7 million per year.\n\nDiscussions with seven manufacturers of slow-scan television and\n\nrelated equipment revealed a real interest in the NASA CTT technology\n\nwith its 1-3 sec/frame compression/decompression rate. In addition,\n\n(based on their experience), they have some conviction that a significant\n\nmarket exists for it.\n\nA review of emerging technologies revealed no means for transmitting\n\nimaging data that appeared to be cost-effective in a small system. Fiber\n\noptics transmission requires a large initial capital outlay for trench\n\ninstallation. In addition, because of differing performance criteria\n\nof different manufacturers for injection lasers and receivers, equipment\n\nis not interchangeable and therefore not yet acceptable to potential\n\nusers of traffic surveillance and control systems.

That is, the communication channel mch-cing\nthe transmitting and receiving antennas as well as the\nenvironment through which the signals propagate between is a wideband Gaussian channel,\nIn accordance with the present invention, each DSN\nalso includes a Viterbi decoder 24 which is desigred to\nrespond to the receiver/demodulator output aria attempts to reproduce the original data stream entering\nthe convolutional encoder 16 in the spacecraft\nAs hereinbefore defined the Viterbi decoder 24 together with the encoder 16 and the modulator/transmitter 17 and the receiverldemodulator 22 together\nwith the wide band Gaussian noise channel (bet,\'een\nthe spacecraft and Earth) represent a Viterbi charnel\nWith K=7 and r=2, the Viterbi channel is sometims\nreferred to as the Jupiter/Saturn channel by those involved in constructing a communication channel for a\nspacecraft to be used in missions planned for the late\n1970\'s to explore Jupiter and Saturn. Viterbi decoders\nwith different K and v are presently available as off the\nshelf items One source is Linkabit Corporation of San\nDiego, Calif, whose literature extensively describes\nsuch channels Modulator/transmitters, like 17 and\nreceiver/demodulators like 22 as herembefore defined\nas well known by those familiar with the art of communication, particularly as related to space communication Such modulator/transmitters and recenerjdemodulators have been used in prior space missions\nand are described in literature\nThe output of the Viterbi decoder 24 (of each DSN)\nis directly supplied to a single RS decoder and deinterleaver 25, hereinafter simply referred to as the RS\ndecoder 25. Its function is to decode the Viterbi decoder output by separating the received 16 (\'hen\n1=16) interleaved RS codewords into separate RS\ncodewords and thereafter decode these words The\noutput of RS decoder 25 in essence represents the\ncompressed data which data compressor 12 supplied to\nthe RS coder 14 in the spacecraft The compressed\ndata from RS decoder 25 is then supplied to a data\ndecomnpressor 27 which effectively reconstructs from\nthe compressed data an approximation to the original\nnoncompressed data, provided in the spacecraft by\ndata source 10 to data compressor 12. The reconstructed non-compressed data from decompressor 27 is\nsupplied to a data processor 29 for processing, e g.,\nproduce an approximation of the original picture. cxcept for any lost source blocks due to errors in the\ntransmission The RS decoder 25, the data decompressor 27 and the data processor 29, are located at a central data processing center 30, such as the one presently existing for processing data received from prior\nspace missions\nIt should be appreciated that the arrangement shown\nin FIG 1 is a concatenated RS-Viterbi channel or s stern for communicating compressed data from a spacecraft. It is conceded that such a channel is discussed in\nreference C However, therein the channel was only\nanalyzed under ideal conditions (a =o). Also in reference C no consideration was given to the usefulness of\nthe channel to transmit compressed data under any\nconditions\nThe great advantage of the channel to transmit cornpressed data will become apparent from the following\ndiscussion on which the invention is based The aiscussion may be facilitated by considering compressed\nimage data. As hereinbefore suggested let it be asastream\n_, u edthat the data source 10tsone providing astrea\nprovidin\n;on\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n6\n\nof bits representing an original picture, as shown in\nFIG 2. Let it be assumed that the picture consists of\n512 bs 512 picture elements or pixels, and each pixel\nfrom source 10 is represented by eight bits (for 256\ngrey le el quantization) Let it further be assumed that\nthe data compressor 12 compresses the data into\nsource blocks, each consisting of a two dimensional\narray of 64 b. 64 pixels.\nThese source blocks are made independent by preceding the bits representing each source block with a\nsufficientir\nlong sync word Each sync word is used to\nidentif, the start of the following source block By\nchoosing a sufficiently large source block (in terms of\nthe iumber of bits) the sync word has negligible effect\non the transmission rate In FIG. 2, the smaller squares\nrepresent the separate source blocks In FIG 2 a small\nx in a source block means that after reception the cor\xc2\xad\nresponding source block has an error somewhere in it\nIt is assumed that a bit error in any source block, re\xc2\xad\ngardless of where the error occurs within a compressed\nsource block, the block is completely lost, since a single\nerror in the compressed data stream is often propa\xc2\xad\ngated oy the data decompressor into many errors in the\ndecornressed data The above assumption is a worst\ncase assumption and therefore includes any data com\xc2\xad\npression process which may be used\nA ke\' point in this example is that because the loca\xc2\xad\ntion of bit errors was generally uniformly distnbuted\nthroughout the compressed data, each error appeared\nin a different compressed source block Consequently,\neach error caused the loss of a different source block.\nIf such compressed data were to be transmitted through\na Jupiter:Saturn channel (a Viterbi channel with K=7\nand -=Z) extremely low average bit error rates P on\nthe orcer of lO- 6 and 10- \' will be required. And, even\nthen the errors will tend to occur in approximately this\nrandom fashion\nReference is now made to FIG 3 in which the Jupi\xc2\xad\ntcr/Saturn channel performance curve is shown, under\nassumed ideal conditions, i e , a = w It sdesignated by\nnumeral 42. As is known to those familiar with the art\nfor uncompressed image data, hereinafter referred to\nas uncompressed- PCM, avirage bit errors probability\nP, below 5 x 10 3 is regarded as negligible Thus, the\nJupiteriSaturn channel can operate as a signal-to-noise\nratio, EdJNO = 2 6 db. However, to obtain average bit\nerror bit probability on the order of 10 for com\xc2\xad\npressed data the required increase in EJN is about 3\ndb higher which corresponds to a reduction in trans\xc2\xad\nmission rate by a factor of about two under only ideal\nconoitons Thus, a net gain cannot be obtained from\nthe data compression and the Jupiter/Saturn channel\nunless the average compression factor (CF) exceeds\napproximately two However, under practical operat\xc2\xad\ntag conditions, as will be described hereinafter, in\nwhich a - wmuch higher EdN is required to obtain\nvery low bt error probability on the order of 10- 0\nFurthermore, in the Juptter/Saturn channel with rela\xc2\xad\ntively low values of a, bit error probability on the order\nof 10- or less is not even obtainable, except with ex\xc2\xad\ntremely large EbNo. This will become apparent from\nthe discussion in connection with FIG. 10.\nThe reason that the Jupiter/Saturn channel is not\nefficient for data compression communication is due to\nthe fact that its performance curve is not steep enough.\nThat is. to lower F6 from 5 X I0- 3 to about 10- re\xc2\xad\nquires a large increase in E./N, Another important\npoint is the general random distribution of individual\n\nA-10\n\n3,988.677\n\n7\n\nbit errors in the Jupiter/Saturn channel at low F values\n5\non the order of 10-0. Consequently, if the Jupiter/Saturn channel were used, due to the random distribuion of the individual bit errors, the reconstructed picture would look as shown in FIG. 2 with the black\nsource blocks being lost blocks, which in most cases\nwould be unacceptable If should thus be appreciated\nthat one desired property of the channel is that for a\ngven average error probability, the errors occur in\nbursts For example, if as shown in FIG. 4, which is\nsimilar to FIG 2, the eight errors were to occur in one\nsource block since the first error in the compressed\nsource block causes all the damage, the other seven\nerrors are of no consequence and therefore an the reconstructed picture the eight errors will only cause the\nloss of a single source block\nThe proposed solution to this problem is provided by\nthe insertion of the RS coder 14 in the spacecraft and\nthe RS decoder 25 on the ground A key to the simplicity of this configuration is that the RS decoder need not\nbe inserted in each DSN station and only one such\ndecoder 25 is needed at the central data processing\ncenter 30. The RS encoder 14 can be considered together with the data compressor 12 as the source encoding unit, and the RS decoder 25 as part of the data\nprocessing center, with the communication channel\nbeing the Jupiter/Saturn channel (Viterbi channel with\nK=7. 1-2) However, to demonstrate that the addition\nof the RS coding and decoding offers a solution for the\ncommunication of compressed data the purpose is better se ed by regarding the RS coder and decoder as\npart of the concatenated RS-Viterbi channel or system.\nAs is appreciated by those familiar with RS coders\nand as diagrammed in simple form in FIG. 5, let it be\nassumed that J[2 J - (1+2E)] information bits from a\nsource, such as compressor 12, are received The result\nof the coding operation is a codeword of 2\' - I RS\nsymbols of which the first 2 - ( 1+2E) are RS information symbols, representing the incoming information\nbits, and the remainder of the codeword is filled with\n2E panty symbols An RS symbol (whether information\nor panty) is in error if any of the J bits making up the\nsymbol are in error. E represents the number of correctable RS symbol errors in an RS codeword. That is,\nif E or less RS symbols ma codeword are an error in any\nway, the RS decoder will be capable of correcting\nthem FIG. 6 is a diagram of the basic RS codeword\nstructure for J", E= 6, formed for a stream of 1784\ninformation bits entering the RS coder 14.\nTo make the most effective use of the power of RS\ncoding when concatenated with Viterbi decoded con%olutionalcodes requires interleaving This is because\nof the burstmness in error events experienced by Viterbi\ndecoders at values of Eb./N 0 of interest (between 2 0\nand 2 5 db) Without interleaving Viterbi decoder\nburst error events would tend to occur within one RS\ncodeword That one codeword would have to correct\nall of these errors Thus, over a period of time there\nwould be a tendency for some codewords to have "too\nmany" errors to correct (i e, greater than 16, when\nE=16) while the remaining codewords would have"too\nfew" (i e, much less than 16). This situation does not\nmake effective use of the capabilities of the RS coding\nThe effect of interleaving is to spread these bursty error\nevents over many codewords so that the RS decoder\ntends to work uniformly hard on all the data\nTwo methods of interleaving will be investigated\nhere We will call them Interleave A and Interleave B\nReproduced from\n6\n\nest available copy.\n\nORIGiHAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n)\n\n8\n\nThe first exhibits a slight performance advantage in the\ntransmission of compressed data whereas the second\noffers an advantage in memory requirements for the\nonboard RS coder 14. In both cases we,will assume an\n- interleaver depth, 1=--16\nINTERLEAVE A\nA diagram illustrating Interleave A is shown in FIG\n7. The consecutive numbers 1, 2 ... , 3568 denote\nlabeling of consecutive RS information symbols which\nare to be interleaved and coded into 16 RS codewords\nThese symbols correspond to the compressed data\ngrouped into eight bit symbols) as it would enter the\nRS coder 14 from data compressor 12. We call this\nsequence of bits an Information Code Block to distin\xc2\xad\nguish it from a Code Block which also includes parity\nsymbols The length of an Information Code Block is\n\' 16) (223)= 3.568 RS symbols or (8) (3568) 28,544\nbits\n5 The crosshatched regions specify which RS informaZion symbols belong to each of the 16 codewords As\nspecified, the first 223 form the information symbols of\ncodeword 1, the second 223 information symbols be\xc2\xad\nlong to codevord 2, and so on Without interleaving\n25 these symbols along with their 32 panty symbols,\nould be transmitted over the Jupiter/Saturn channel\nin the order in which they appear Thus a particularly\n\'ong burst of errors from the Viterbi decoder would\ntend to affect the symbols of only one codeword With\nInterleave A the order of RS information symbol trans\xc2\xad\nmission is ( I. 224,..., 3346), (2, 225,... ,3347),.\n.(223, 446,..., 3568). That is, the first symbol from\ncodeword 1, the first symbol from codeword 2,..., the\nfirst symbol from codeword 16, the second symbol\n3- from codeword 1,and so on The parity symbols would\nfollow in the same manner. With this arrangement it\nshould be clear that a burst oferrors that spans k\n16\nRS symbols (128 bits) will be distributed among k dif\xc2\xad\nferent codewords.\nA\' Since the information symbol 3346 in the 16th sym\xc2\xad\nol to be transmitted, memory for the complete Infor\xc2\xad\nmation Code Block must be provided in addition to\nthat required for panty symbol generation However,\nwith present day technology this much working mem\xc2\xad\n4- ory today is really insignificant For example, Ad\xc2\xad\n%ancedPioneer mission planners are presently assum\xc2\xad\ning at least 10\' bits of working memory. Single solid\nstate chips are available off the shelf with 4096 bits of\nrandom access memory. However, we point out that\n50\n-the second interleave method, Interleave B,does offer\nan advantage in this area by requiring memory only for\nthe panty symbols\nIf 16 or less RS symbols of a codeword are in error\nbefore entering the RS decoder, then all information\n55 symbols of that codeword leaving the decoder will be\ncorrect No decoding error is made On the other hand,\nif more than 16 RS symbols of a particular codeword\naremin error beforedecoding, then adecodingerror will\noccur and the output information symbols may have\n60 many errors If we interpret FIG. 7 as describing an\noutput Information Code Block we see that the effect\nof a decoding error on a particular codeword is con\xc2\xad\nstrained to the corresponding crossbatched region for\nthat codeword Thus, for Interleave A the effect of an\n\xc2\xad RS decoding error is confined to consecutive symbols\nA.n RS decoding error will appear as a burst of errors of\nup to 223 symbols in length (1784 bits).

The bene\xc2\xad\nfits derived may similarly be considered as end-to\xc2\xad\nend benefits. The implications of this approach art\nfar broader than the dtcp space communication prob\xc2\xad\nlem for which it was intended.\n\nThis paper presents a one-dimensional Block\nAdaptie Rate Controlled (BARC) image data cornpression algorithm recently developed for applications having extremely high fidelity requirements\nsuch as archi%)ng and certain scientific investigations. This development is an outgrowth of earlier\nwork involving both channel coding and image data\ncompression,\n\nRM2. The AICS concept introduced in Ref.

Thus a slightly higher bits!\nsample results in slightly better image reconstruction\n\nBARC will first be introduced in combination with\na brief review of this related earlier work. Impor\xc2\xad\ntant functional and performance relationships will be\ndescribed. Later sections will provide a more detailed definition of BARC.\n\ntAt this same signal-to-noise ratio.

Functionally\nboth algorithms allow arbitrary selectable compression\nrates but the RM2 two-dimensional structure gives it\na broader range of useful options. That is, at high\nrates of 3.0 bit/sample and above the performance of\nFoth algorillhmnb is tcuivalent whereas at lower rates\nRM2 exhibits a decided advantage. On an absolute\nscale, degradation to visual image quality can be cxpected to be imperceptible at selected rates of 3.0\nbits/sample and above for virtually any source data.\nBoth algorithms can be operated ais floating rate\nnoiseless coders with code rates close to the data differential entropy for all entropies above the neighborhood of 0.7 bits/sample.\nThus BARC basically provides the top end of the\nRM2 rate/quality performance range while needing\nonly one-dimensional processing. The latter means\nthat BARC is also applicable to other non-imaging\nforms of correlated data for which there are stringent\nfidelity requirements,\n\nNoiseless Coding\n\n,1\n\nApplying the Universal Noiseless Code operator\n\nin Fig. 2 to Di(t.) yields the binary sequctc\n\n\n4,B P1(t)(2)\n\nfrom which $(t ) can be reconstructed exactly (hence\ni\nLhe term noiseless coding).
