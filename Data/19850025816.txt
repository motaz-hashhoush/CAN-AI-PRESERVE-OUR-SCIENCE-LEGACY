Converti\nThis patent refers to a life saving device fcr ships, \t\n\n/*\n\nboth aircraft and maritime vessels.\nMore specifically, this patent protects a device of the type\nspecified, which belongs to the group of small craft carried in\ndifferent numbers by ships making extensive voyages. These craft\naccommodate groups of people in emergencies, whether due to fire,\nshipwreck, or difficulties in staying afloat or aloft.\nThe above-mentioned accidents \t are particularly serious\t in\naeronavigation and are complicated by panic among passengers,\nwhich has\t an\t extremely detrimental\t effect.\t\n\nIf any of\t these\n\nsituations\t occur\t during\t flights\t over\t the high\t seas,\t\n\nthe only\n\nrecourse presently known \t is\t the use of rubber boats \t and\nparachutes.\t\n\nBoth of these solutions\t involve serious\t dangers and\n\nprecarious\t conditions\t in\t view of\t the\t sea\'s\t inclemencies.\nSimilarly,\t when\t these accidents\t occur during flights \t over dry\nland,\t\n\nthe only known\t recourse\t is\t the\t use\t of parachutes.\t\n\nthe\t dangers\t are\t fewer-,\t\n\nAlthough\n\nthis\t solution\t involves\t problems\t which are\n\nimpossible\t to\t predict\t due\t to\t the\t characteristics\t of\t landing\nareas.\t\n\nIn\t addition,\t\n\nit\t has\t also been\t moved\t that\t there\t have been\n\naccidents\t so serious and unexpected that\t all\t the\t crew and\npassengers have not\t hail enough\t time to organize,\t prepare\nthemselves,\t and\t juun.\n\nL\n\nSimilarly, when ships transporting passengers wreck, the only\navailable recourse is the use of boats or launches which these\n\n*Numbers in the -argin indicate pagination in the foreign text.\n\n4\n\nships normally carry for aid.\t\n\nIt is known that such small craft\n\nare not safe enough on the high seas, especially during storms or\nrough swells.\nThis means that at present there are no totally safe life\nsaving elements for either air or sea. \t\n\nThe device described in\n\nthis patent provides the solution to this inadequacy.\nIn effect, this new life saving device consists of a\ncontainer which provides the following conditions: \t\n\na) it is\n\ntotall y and hermetically sealed; b) it can hold a group of\npeople; c) it floats; d) it allows the occupants to see their\nsurroundings; e) it contains resources for survival for several\ndays, despite being totally sealed, since it is stocked with\ncompressed oxygen, water, food and medicines for at least first\naid, clothing, a source of energy for lighting and signaling,\netc.\nWith current knowledge of electrical energy, wireless\ncommunication, concentrated food, etc., it is possible to equip\neach container well enough to ensure its occupants\' survival for\nthe number of days needed to reach land, or (which is more\nprobable) until appropriate help arrives, i.e. helicopters\t\n\nL\nhelicopters or ships which have somehow learned of the accident,\n\nj\t\n\npossibly by having received cal l s for help sent by the device\'s\n\n1i\t\n\noccupants.\n\n4^\nIn order to make this invention easier to understand, two\nsheets are attached which illustrate non-limiting e xamples.\nThese example, were schematically drawn on no particular scale\nand are described below.\n\nFigure No. 1 shows a view in perspective of an aircraft\nequipped with a number of the devices described in this patent..\n\n5\n\nFigure No. 2 is a schematic lateral view of the aircra\ndepicted in the preceding figure.\n\nFigure No. 3 is a cross section on a larger scale, ind\none of the many ways provided for opening the fuselage and\nlaunching the life saving units, as per this invention.\n\nFigure No. 4 is a diagram similar to the one in the pr\nfigure with anotl_er of the variations provided fer opening\nlaunching.\n\nFigure No. 5 is another variation of the same aspect.\n\nFigure No. 6 is a cross section on a scale even larger\nin the preceding figures, making it possible to observe mo\ndetails.\n\nFigure No. 7 is the schematic view of a plan for an oceangoing ship, with devices as per the same invention.\n\nThe same reference numbers are given to similar or equivalent\nparts or elements constituting the assemblies in all figures.\nThese assemblies are examples given only as illustrations for\nthis explanation of the invented device.\n\nAs can be clearly seen in Figures 1, 2, and 7, the device\ndecribed in this patent consists of several surviv g l units (1),\nall hermetically sealed and placed in an orderly way in the\nfuselage (2) of a passenger plane or the hull (3) of a\nconventional transatlantic ship, respectively.\n\nThe respective gates (4) close outside the correspc,ding\nspaces where the units (1) are housed. These gates can be\nreleased quickly.\n\n6\n\nIn the case of an airt-raft (Figures 1-6), the survival units\n(1) consist of hermetically sealed, preferably spherical\ncontainers, each of which has two concentric walls. These walls\nwill be made of nonflammable material; they will also be plated\nwith st el whose exterior has been painted with fireproof\nThe interconnection between the external and internal\n\nmaterial.\t\n\nwalls is elastic in order to absorb possible shocks or \t\n\nL\n\nimpacts from the fall. This feature is indicated with internal\nsprings (5).\n\nStill referring to survival units for airplanes, these units\nwill have upper hooks (6) which can be grasped by helicopters.\nThey will also have doors and windows (7) and (8) for obvious\nreasons.\t\n\nIn addition, two or more (preferably floating) shoes\n\n(9) will be symmetrically positioned in the lower area; they can\nbe useful for helping to stabilize the unit when it is floating\nat sea, or can be a means of support or a supporting leg if the\nunit is deposited on dry land.\n\nThese units are fastened inside the plane\'s fuselage with\nmeans capable of suporting them rigidly while flight conditicns\nare normal. At the same time, these units can be released or\nfreed immediately if an accident is forseen or a problem occurs\nduring flight.\t\n\nIn addition to instantaneous release of the units\n\n(1), the respecitve individual gates (4) will open. \t\n\nAll of this\n\nwill be centrally operated from the cockpit and complementary\nmanual operating elements will be located within the passengers\'\nreach inside the abovementioned units.\n\nFigures No. 3, 4, 5, and 6 give some examples of \t\n\nL\n\nsuitable methods for opening the gates (4) instantaneously. Note\nthat many other methods may be adopted, but that this does not\naffect the protection given by this patent, since this\ninvention\'s novelty does not depend on the method used, but on\nthe foresight of including any method or a similar suitable\n\n7\n\nmethod. The arrows (F) shown with dotted lines in Figures No. 3\nand 4 serve only to indicate how both gates (4) begin to move\nwith respect to the fuselage (2). It must be noted that among\nthe many possible methods are some which propel the containers\n(1) with their passengers outward by using explosive elements\nwith appropriate expanding power.\n\nIn an emergency, once all units (1) with their occupants have\nbeen ejected from the aircraft, their survival guaranteed, and\nrescue is completed with complementary outside work generally\nundertaken by third parties. Thus, for example, if these units\nare floating at sea, or land in jungles, deserts, mountains,\netc., each one of them will be hung from a helicopter, taking\nadvantage of the upper hooks -6-, and will be transported to a\nsuitable place so that the passengers can vacate the\nabovementioned containers.\n\nL\n\nMoreover, there is a housing for a parachute in the \t\n\nupper area (10) of each container. This parachute can be of the\ntype which automatically unfolds when these units separate from\nthe fuselage, or of the type which can be manually and directly\noperated by the occupants. Ajain, this detail does not affect\nthis invention\'s novelty.\n\nOnce the survival units (1) arc: released, their occupants\nwill remain comfortably in their seats (11), freed from the\nplane\'s fate and descending slowly until the containers hit water\nor land.\t\n\nThe parachute is independent in either case. \t\n\nThe\n\nairtight double wall protects the passengers from cold, water\nand/or low pressure in the case of high altitude.\n\nEach unit will have some means of radio communication\npowerful enough to emit an acceptable signal.\t\nserve to locate the unit. \t\n\nThis signal will\n\nIn addition, enclosures (12), (13),\n\n(14), etc. will be included for holding water, oxygen, food,\nmedicine, tools, etc. in order to ensure }he occupants\'\n8\n\nsurvival until such time as they are rescued, which can even mean\nfor several days.\n\nThe survival units (1) will be conveniently distributed in\npairs, as can be seen in Figures No. 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. \t\n\nThis\n\nleaves an intermediate longitudinal passage on which all the\nunits\' corresponding doors (8) converge, thus permitting \t\n\nL\n\ncomfortable internal circulation while the flight proceeds\nnormally.\n\nRegarding survival a?,its (1) for ocean vessels, as shown in\nFigure 7, the need for parachutes and a spherical-shaped\ncontainers no longer applies. However, all else said about\nseperation from the ship is applicable since, for example, if a\nship is on fire or sinking, the airtight double wall and all the\nother resources for first aid, food supply, etc. previously\ndescribed are extremely useful.\n\nWhen implementing the life-saving device thus described and\nillustrated, many modifications and/or improvements can be\nintroduced. All modifications and improvements should be\nconsidered variations for implementation which are included\nwithin this patent\'s scope of protection. \t\n\nThis scope is\n\nbasically determined by the text of the following claims.\n\nCLAIMS\nHaving described and illustrated the nature ind \t\n\nL\n\nprincipal purpose of this invention, as well as the way in which\nit can be implemented, the following are claimed as property and\nexclusive rights:\n\n1.
