Supersonic laminar flow control has been identified as a program element, since it offers significant drag-reduction benefits and is one of the more promising technologies for producing an economically viable aircraft design. NASA is using two prototype F-16XL aircraft to research supersonic laminar flow control. The F-16XL planform is similar to design planforms of high-speed civil transports. The planform makes the aircraft ideally suited for developing technology pertinent to high-speed transports. The supersonic laminar flow control research programs for both aircraft are described. Some general results of the ship-1 program demonstrate that significant laminar flow was obtained using laminar flow control on a highly swept wing at supersonic speeds.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19940035351, "endDate": "1992-10-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "SAE"}}, "meetingId": "85c8987c09b348d59906aa0a8da30070", "id": "39477b646a874dc2b660b4aa00f82d13"}], "name": "SAE, Aerotech ''92 Conference", "location": "Anaheim, CA", "id": "85c8987c09b348d59906aa0a8da30070", "startDate": "1992-10-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940035351, "id": "55cb2cfdf9754ed19168e0d6b8839828", "publicationDate": "1992-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
