b'19. QUIET ENGINE PROGRAM\nDETAILED ENGINE DESIGNS\nBy James J. Kramer\nNASA Lewis Research Center\nSUMMARY\nThe engine design constraints developed to insure maximum turbofan engine\nquieting are reviewed. Two engines designed within these constraints are discussed and\ntheir noise levels estimated, The supporting fan noise research program is briefly discussed and some preliminary fan noise data presented.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the early part of the Quiet Engine Definition Program a rather wide range of\nengine configurations was examined as discussed in reference 1. Later, a set of design\nconstraints was selected within which engines were designed in more detail under contract\nby Allison Division of General Motors Corporation (Contract NAS3-10496) and Pratt &\nWhitney Division of United Aircraft Corporation (Contract NAS3- 10497). These engines\na r e reviewed and the supporting fan noise research program is discussed in this paper.\nQUIET ENGINE DESIGN CONSTRAINTS\nThe design constraints that were chosen for the final phase of the design study\nactivity for the Quiet Engine Definition Program a r e given in table I. The general considerations which led to these constraints are discussed in this section.\nEngine\nThe screening of various engine layout designs resulted in the conclusion that a\nquiet engine should have a bypass ratio in the range of 5 to 6. The cruise thrust was set\nat 4900 lb; the corresponding take-off thrust for such an engine, about 22 000 lb.\nFan\nBecause the fan dominates the noise output of such an engine, the specification of\nthe fan design was a prime consideration. The anticipation that considerable information will be learned about fan noise in the next few years made it desirable to be able to\n273\n\nincorporate that technology in the quiet engine as it was developed. Therefore, the fan\nwas specified to be mounted on a shaft by itself with no compressor stages so that changes\nin fan configuration and speed could be achieved with the least impact on the rest of the\nengine.\nThe effect of blade loading on the fan noise production is not well known at this\ntime. In order to have lightly loaded blades, it is necessary to use two or more fan\nstages. For a bypass-ratio-5 engine, the fan pressure ratio can be achieved with one\nheavily loaded stage. The noise predictions did not indicate a noise advantage for the\ntwo-stage fan, but these predictions have considerable uncertainty associated with them.\nA weight penalty is associated with a two-stage fan compared with a single-stage fan. A\nsingle-stage fan was selected for the engine design, but investigations of the noise performance of both two-stage fans and single-stage fans will be part of the supporting\nexperimental program.\nIn order to minimize the noise associated with the single-stage fan, inlet guide\nvanes were ruled out and the spacing between rotor and stator blade rows was specified\nto be at least 2 rotor chords. It was desired to have the flow subsonic over the blades\nin order to eliminate the noise associated with supersonic relative velocities, the socalled "shock noise" or "buzz-saw noise." In order to achieve subsonic relative flow, the\ntip speed at take-off could be a maximum of about 1000 ft/sec. These engines operate so\nthat the tip speed at take-off is about 10 percent lower than the value at the cruise condition. Thus, the take-off tip-speed limit of 1000 ft/sec corresponds to a cruise tip speed\nof 1100 ft/sec. The engine is designed for the cruise condition. In figure 1, fan pressure ratio is plotted against a blade loading parameter D factor for a tip speed of\n1100 ft/sec. The present state of the art is such that allowable D factors are 0.5 or\nlower. Figure 1 shows that a fan pressure ratio of the order of 1.6 can be achieved with\nstate-of-the-art blade loading limits with this tip-speed limitation.\nIn figure 2, engine specific fuel consumption is shown as a function of fan pressure\nratio. There is a marked increase in fuel consumption at fan pressure ratios below 1.5\nfor an engine with a bypass ratio on the order of 5. Thus, for good economy a fan pressure ratio of 1.5 is required and reasonable blade loading limits the ratio to a maximum\nof 1.6.\nCompressor\nParametric engine performance studies have indicated that the specific fuel consumption of these engines began to increase rapidly as the cycle pressure ratio (overall\ncompression ratio) decreased below 18. The specific fuel consumption continued to\ndecrease as cycle pressure ratio increased but not very rapidly as shown in figure 3.\nTherefore, the minimum cycle pressure ratio for good fuel economy, specific fuel\n\n274\n\nconsumption, was determined to be 18. In order to achieve an overall compression ratio\nof 18 with a fan pressure ratio of 1.5 the pressure ratio required of the compressor is 12.\nBoth two-spool and three-spool engines were considered. They differ in that the main\ncompressor is made up of one or two rotors. A limit of 12.5 was set as the maximum\npressure ratio per compressor rotor in order to avoid any problems associated with highpressure-ratio compressors. A two-spool engine with a 1.5-pressure-ratio fan and a\nsingle- rotor compressor with a 12: 1-pressure-ratio compressor has an overall cycle\npressure (compression) ratio of 18. Thus, this limit permits the use of a single-rotor\ncompressor - that is, a two-spool engine. Dual-rotor compressors as used in a threespool engine develop a pressure ratio across each rotor on the order of 4 or 5; therefore, the limiting value of 12.5 does not influence the three-spool engine.\nTurbine\nThe turbine temperatures at cruise and take-off are important because they set the\njet noise level. The fan noise suppressor technology has progressed to the point where\nthere is some hope that a 10-PNdB suppressor can be developed even for large-diameter\nengines. In order to achieve the quietest power plant possible, this quiet engine would\nbe used with a fan inlet and exhaust suppressor. The hot jet mixing noise represents the\nfloor for engine noise output. Reductions in fan noise below this floor a r e of no benefit\nto the observer. Therefore, the jet noise should be at least 10 PNdB below the fan noise\nif advantage is to be taken of the fan noise suppressor technology being developed. The\nrough estimate of the fan noise at 1000-ft altitude at take-off power was 105 PNdB; the\njet noise maximum should then be 95 PNdB. In figure 4 the jet noise level in PNdB for\nan observer of 8 1000-ft flyover is plotted against design turbine inlet temperature. The\ndesign turbine temperature must be 1775O F or lower in order to assure adequately low\njet noise levels. This design-turbine-temperature limit of 1775O F corresponds to a\ntake-off turbine temperature of 2000\xc2\xb0 F.\nENGINE DESIGNS\nAllison Division of General Motors Corporation and Pratt & Whitney Division of\nUnited Aircraft Corporation conducted detailed design studies of these engines under\ncontract for Lewis Research Center and did a complete aerodynamic and mechanical\ndesign of the fan.\nThe engine designed by Allison is a three-spool engine and is shown in figure 5.\nThe single-stage fan develops a pressure ratio of 1.5 at cruise and has a diameter of\n74 in. The tip speed at take-off is 1020 ft/sec. The fan blade has a chord at the tip of\n6.2 in. and an aspect ratio of 3. The fan is driven by a five-stage turbine, offset somewhat from the gas generator turbine in order to obtain higher tip speed at a given\n275\n\nrotational speed. The overall compression ratio of 24 is achieved with a 16:l compressor consisting of two rotors having eight stages and pressure ratios of 4. Each rotor\nis driven by a single-stage turbine. The overall lengthhis153 in. and the weight is estimated at 4790 lb. The noise performance is summarized in table II. An observer on the\nground 3 miles from the start of take-off roll would be subjected to 105 PNdl3 by a fully\nloaded four-engine airplane of the DC-8 type equipped with engines of this design without\nsuppressors as it passed overhead at an altitude of 1000 ft. The jet noise is estimated\nat 93 PNdB so that further fan noise reduction with suppressors would be beneficial. The\nAllison noise estimation procedure is an empirical correlation based on several fan\nparameters, the most important of which is the flow Mach number relative to the blades.\nIt takes into account the blade spacing, loading, and the presence of upstream blade rows,\nif any.\nThe Pratt & Whitney engine designed within the constraints given in table I is shown\nin figure 6. The single-stage fan has a take-off tip speed of 1000 ft/sec and develops a\npressure ratio at cruise of 1.6. The rotor blade has a rather long chord at the tip, 7 in.,\nand an aspect ratio of 2.2. The fan diameter is 68.9 in. The engine has two spools. The\nsingle-rotor compressor develops a pressure ratio of 12.5 and has five stages of variable\nstators. The compressor is driven by a two-stage high-pressure turbine. The first\nstator, first rotor, and second stator are air-cooled. This is also true of the Allison\nengine. The fan turbine is a five-stage in-line turbine. The overall length is 118 in. and\nthe weight is 4950 lb.\n1\nThe noise performance of this engine is summarized in table 1 . A ground observer\nwould hear 106 PNdB as a fully loaded four-engine airplane of the 707 type equipped with\nengines of this design passed overhead at an altitude of 1000 f t at take-off power. A mile\nfrom touchdown on approach an observer hears 104 PNdB. The corresponding jet noise\nlevels at these observation points are 94 PNdB and 84 PNdB, respectively. The jet noise\nestimates for both the Pratt & Whitney and Allison engines a r e not as precise as the usual\njet noise estimates because the jet velocities have been reduced to the point where the jet\nnoise is not following the familiar eighth-power-of -velocity correlation law. Even at\ntake-off power at 1000-ft altitude the jet velocity is less than 1000 ft/sec relative to the\nsurrounding atmosphere.\n\nThe fan noise is still the dominant source and suppressors would benefit the ground\nobserver. The fan noise prediction method at Pratt & Whitney is based on test data\nobtained with the JT3D and JT9D engines. The prime correlating parameter is the rotational tip speed of the fan. It is interesting that the estimated fan noise outputs from\nPratt & Whitney and Allison a r e quite comparable although the prediction methods differ\nconsiderably in format.\nThese design studies have indicated several things. The combination of the highbypass-ratio engine and moderate turbine temperatures result in sharp reductions in jet\n\n276\n\nnoise. Estimates of the fan noise reduction possible with a low-tip-speed fan are significant but the fan remains the dominant noise source. There is a weight penalty associated with the low-tip-speed fan but it is not such as to rule out the use of this quieting\nfeature in practical aircraft propulsion systems.\nThe NASA plans to build and test several engines of the general character discussed\nherein. This experimental engine program will demonstrate the amount of quieting that\ncan be achieved in complete engine systems.\nFAN NOISE RESEARCH\nThe main noise problem is the fan. The experimental research program on fan\nf\nnoise supporting the Quiet Engine Program has begun. One o the fan experiments was\nconducted under contract by the General Electric Company (Contract NAS3-11166) with a\nmodified version of the TF39 engine. The fan section of the unmodified TF39 engine is\nshown in figure 7. The inner portion of the fan is a two-stage device with no inlet guide\nvanes. The outer portion is a single stage with a row of inlet guide vanes. General\nElectric modified the fan section of a TF39 engine by removing the outer portion of the\nfan and spacing the blade rows of the inner portion to provide a distance of approximately\n1 chord between rows. The modified fan is shown in figure 8. The inner portion of the\nfan developed a pressure ratio of 1.5 at a tip speed of 1000 ft/sec.\nAs mentioned previously, a single-stage fan was specified for the quiet engine\ndesign but tests of two-stage fans were to be part of the supporting research program.\nThe modified TF39 engine was tested and some preliminary engine noise data are shown\nin figures 9 and 10. Figure 9 is a plot of perceived noise level as a function of angular\nposition around the engine as measured at a 225-ft radius for take-off power setting. The\nmaximum occurred at the 110\' position at take-off power setting. The corresponding\nperceived noise levels for a four-engine airplane flying 1000 f t overhead at take-off power\nand at 325-ft altitude at approach power a r e 110 PNdB and 115 PNdB. These values are\nnot as low as those estimated for the single-stage low-tip-speed fan.\n\nIn order to obtain data on single-stage fans such as this, a fan test rig is being constructed at Lewis in order to obtain far-field noise data. A sketch of the facility is\nshown in figure 11. It will drive 72-in-diameter fans up to tip speeds of 1200 ft/sec.\nThe first fan model to be tested in the facility has been designed and built at the\nLewis Research Center. It is a single-stage device designed to produce a 1.5 pressure\nratio and to operate at a take-off tip speed of 1000 ft/sec, has a chord of 5.5 inches and\nan aspect ratio of 3.5, and is designed to produce a uniform pressure ratio along the span.\nThe blade loading is rather high and the blade turns approximately 15O past axial at the\nhub.\n277\n\nFollowing this initial test, the facility will be used to test a series of full-scale\nmodel fans and fan noise suppressors to be used with the quiet engine,\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe design study of turbofan engines for subsonic transport propulsion systems has\nindicated that substantial reductions in jet noise can be achieved by the proper selection\nof engine cycle parameters. Substantial fan noise reductions below current fan noise\nlevels a r e predicted for engines with low-speed single-stage fans without inlet guide\nvanes and with large spacing between rotors and stators. Further reductions in fan noise\nresulting from the use of fan noise suppressors will result in overall installed powerplant noise levels about 20 PNdB lower than current levels.\n\nREFERENCE\n\n1.
