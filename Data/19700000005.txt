The regulator operates in a\nphase-retarded mode, and gives maximum boost\nto the output voltage with minimum phase shift in\nQ3__\n\nDl\n\nEb\n\np4\nE 6\t\n\nS\t\n\nTi\n\n__\n\nE.B\n\nflJ U-1\n\nQ\t\n\nQ 1 2\nC\n\n)\t\nCT1\n\nJR\n\nLS1\t\n\nCT1\t\n\nJ\nI\t\n\nLi\nEo.t\n\n1\n\nCTI-u\nR3 R\n\nD\n\nT\t\n\n.-\t\nMaster\nM.

Ideal Waveforms\n\nOperation of the chopper circuit is adjustably phase\ndisplaced from that of the inverter to permit an\nadditive or subtractive component of voltage to be\nimpressed upon the dc input voltage as required\nfor output voltage regulation.\nThe inverter switching is controlled by the outputs\nof the master M.V. Conduction of either of the\n\nBrief 70-1005\t\n\ninverter transistors Q or Q2 allows the dc input,\nE 1 , to appear across the primary windings of autotransformer TI. This input voltage is coupled to the\ntransformer secondary and provides an ac voltage,\nEB, which is combined with the input and then\napplied to the chopper circuit. The switching of\nthe chopper circuit transistors, Q3 and Q, is controlled by outputs from the slave M.V., and hence\nare phase delayed from the switching of the inverter\ntransistors. This phase displacement, 3, is variable\nand results in the required switching of the power\nchopper transistors between conducting and nonconducting states to cause the impressed voltage from\nthe inverter to be either additive or subtractive. By\nvarying the relative time duration of the buck (subtractive) interval to the boost (additive) interval,\nthe output level can be regulated.\nThe subtractive mode of operation is achieved by\nmaintaining one of the power chopper transistors Q\nand Q 4 in conduction (by means of an inductive load\nLi and current transformer CT!) during the time\nwhen the subtractive half cycle of the impressed\nac voltage is present at the active secondary winding\nof the autotransformer.\nThe output from the chopper circuit is applied\nto an averaging filter Li-Cl, which smooths the\npulsating dc to the desired output level. The resultant dc output, can thus be controlled at a value\nless than, equal to, or greater than E 1 . Figure 2\nis a graphic representation of the ideal waveforms of\nthe circuit operating in either buck, boost, or neutral\nmodes.\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed\nto:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nGoddard Space Flight Center\nGreenbelt, Maryland 20771\nReference: TSP70-10005\n\nPatent status:\nInquiries about obtaining rights for the commercial\nuse of this invention may be made to:\nPatent Counsel\nMail Code 204\nGoddard Space Flight Center\nGreenbelt, Maryland 20771\nSource: T.
