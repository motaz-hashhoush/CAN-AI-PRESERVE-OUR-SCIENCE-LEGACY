For this task, launch vehicles of\na number of sizes and capabilities are necessary. Consequently, the United States is developing a family of\nlaunch vehicles ranging in size and power from the\nslender Scout to the giant Nova.\nObviously, it would be unwise to use a ten-ton truck\nto carry a few parcels or to risk a break-down by\noverloading a small truck. Similarly, it would be impracticable to use Saturn or Nova to orbit a small, lightweight group of scientific instruments, or take the risk\nof failure involved in placing too much weight on any\nsize rocket. Either would be expensive and inefficient.\nBy developing a family of reliable launch vehicles, the\nNation will have available the right size for the right\njob and avoid the expense of employing vehicles that\nare either larger and more powerful than necessary, or\nare marginal in power for the job at hand.\n[ I]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nFor each of the nation\'s launch vehicles, missions have\nbeen assigned. These missions range from scientific\nresearch and exploration to tasks vitally necessary for\nthe national defense.\nAt present, the National Launch Vehicle Program\nincludes twelve basic vehicles. They are Scout, Delta,\nThor-Agena B, Thor-Ablestar, Atlas D, Atlas-Agena\nB, Titan II, Titan III, Centaur, Saturn, Advanced\nSaturn, and Nova. All of these vehicles, with the exception of the Thor-Ablestar, are described in this\nbooklet.\nResponsibilities in the launch vehicle program have\nbeen divided between the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration and the Department of Defense.\nDevelopment of six of the twelve vehicles is managed\nby NASA. These are Scout, Delta, Centaur, Saturn,\nAdvanced Saturn, and Nova. Development of the\nother six is managed by the Air Force as agent for the\nDepartment of Defense. All of them, however, are\navailable to any agency of the Government having work\nto do in space.\n\nAdministrator) National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration\n\n[2 ]\n\nSCOUT\nSTAGES: 4\nPROPELLANTS: Solid\nTHRUST: 1st stage (Algol II- A), 86,000 lbs. at\nsea level ; 2nd stage (Castor ), 64,000 lbs.; 3rd\nstage (An tares), 23,000 lbs. ; 4th stage (Altair),\n3,000 lbs.\nMAXIMUM DIAMETER: 3.3 ft., excluding fins\nHEIGHT: 65 ft., less sp acecraft\nPAYLOAD : 220 Ibs. in 300 n.m. orbit\nFIRST NASA LAUNCH: Jul y 1, 1960\nUSE: Launching of probes and satellites\n\nSCOUT, the smallest m ember of\nthe basic NASA launch vehicle family, was designed to provide\na reliable, relatively inexpensive launch vehicle for many of the\nsmaller payloads needed to conduct pace research. It is the\nonly vehicle of the group using solid propellants exclusively.\nDuring its developmental phase, the vehicle launch ed space\nprobes and orbited a small satellite. Scout is capable of lifting\na 400-pound probe into the lower levels of space or placing a 220pound satellite in a 300-mile orbit. It has the versatility to perform a number of different re earch missions, including orbital\nmis ions, high-altitude probes, and reentry investiga tions. Some\ntypical Scout missions are shown below.\n\n[ 3]\n\nSCOUT MISSIONS\nScientific Satellites\nExplorer IX\n\n4\n2\n\n1961\n1961\n1961-63\n1961-64\n1962-64\n\n6\n4\n2\n\nExplorer XIII\nMicrometeorite\nIonosphere\nMaterials\n\n1962-64\n1962-64\n1963-64\n\n4\n\nProbes\nReentry Heating\nElectric Engines\nLife Science\n\nInternational Satellite\n1963\n\nU.K. No.2\n\nAlthough the development phase of the Scout launch vehicle\nhas essentially been completed, a program is underway to increase\nthe payload capability from 220 to 300 pounds in the 300-mile\norbit. Improvements in some of the engines and the use of the\nnew, high-energy solid propellants which proved successful in the\nAir Force\'s Minuteman ICBM and the Navy\'s Polaris IRBM are\nexpected to bring Scout performance up to the desired level late\nin 1962 or early in 1963.\nNASA\'s basic Scout program included eight vehicles, with\nthirty additional Scouts being produced. Approximately 80\npercent of the latter will be used for orbital flights. The Department of Defense also makes extensive use of modified versions of\nthe Scout for research. In addition to NASA missions, Scout will\nbe used tc launch a number of Air Force experiments, as well as\n\n[4 ]\n\nthe navigation and solar radiation satellites for programs ponsored\nby the Navy.\nWhile the Scout developmental launches were not always successful in all details, in seven out of nine firings the vehicle system\nperformed properly. Ignition failures and a tipoW* problem\nwere the chief difficulties encountered. One of the major\ndevelopment items, the guidance and control system, operated\nperfectly on all nine flights. In addition, the Scout vehicle\nlaunched five useful experiments during the development period.\nSome vehicles under development carry vehicle instrumentation\nonly. The initial Scout program carried out not only the satisfactory development of the first all-solid-propelled pace vehicle,\nbu t also performed the following experiments :\n\nDate\n\nExperime nt\n\nAir Force payload\n\nOctober 1960\n\nExplorer IX\nA ir density experiment using a\n12-ft.-diameter balloon\n\nFebruary 1961\n\nP-21\nElectron density profile probe of\nthe ionosphere\n\nOctober 1961\n\nHigh-speed reentry heating test\n\nMarch 1962\n\nP-21a\nIonosphere probe\n\nMarch 1962\n\n*A dist urbance during the separation of the third stage causing the\nfourth stage to veer off its planned trajectory.

D elta has\nproved, however, to be one of the most reliable launch vehicles\nthe United States possesses, with a long list of successful firings to\nits credit.\nThe gO-foot vehicle uses a modified Thor as its first stage, a\nmodified and improved second stage from the Vanguard and\n\n[7]\n\nThor-Able programs, and the spin-stabi lized, solid-propeIlan t\nAltair for its third stage. The Altair also derived from the earlier\nVanguard and Thor-Able vehicles. Delta thus utilizes proven\nengines, modified to achieve higher reliability and to perform\nnewer missions.\nWith about three times the payload capability of Scout, the\nDelta is also used fo r launching a wide variety of satellites and\nprobes. The first launching, an attempt in May of 1960 to orbit\nthe first Echo satellite, fai led due to an upper-stage malfunction.\nDe lta launches to date are Ii ted in the fo llowing table:\n\nDELTA LAUNCHINGS\nDate\n\nMay 1960\nAugust 1960\nNovember 1960\nMarch 1961\nJuly 1961\nAugust 1961\nFebruary 1962\n\nPayload\n\nEcho\nEcho I\nTiros "\nExplorer X\nTiros III\nExplorer XII\nTiros IV\n\nDa te\n\nMarch 1962\nApril 1962\nJune 1962\nJuly 1962\nSeptember 1962\nOdober J 962\nOdober 1962\n\nPa yload\n\nOSO\nAriel\nTiros V\nTelstar\nTiros VI\nExplorer X IV\nExplorer XV\n\nEcho I is the passive commun ications satel lite which is still\nvisible to the unaided eye.

The Agena was developed by the Air Force\nas a second stage for use in its own programs. Early in 1960\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration decided to\nuse the Agena in combination with the Thor and the Atlas rather\nthan develop a similar vehicle. The NASA version of the Agena\nB is modified slightly so that various types of payloads can be\nbolted onto the front-end. The Air Force has under development a standard vehicle called the Agena D, which will also be\nmade available to NASA in 1963 or 1964.\nThe Thor-Agena B combination can place 1,600 pounds in a\n300-nautical-mile orbit. It is being used by NASA for the\n[ II]\n\nlaunching of meteorological, communications, a nd scientific\nsatellites.

The\nAtlas D is a one-and-one-half-stage vehicle propelled by three\nengines. The thrust of these engines is sufficient, however, to\nplace the Mercury capsule and the empty Atlas D into an orbit\nof approximately 100 mile .\nAll three engines are ignited at launch. The outer two, counted\nas a half stage, are jettisoned at the end of their burning period.\nThe sustainer engine continues to burn until orbital velocity is\nobtained.\nThe Atlas is constructed of thin-gage stainless steel, and its\nstructural rigidity is maintained through internal pre surization.\nHeavier gage skin is requ ired at the forward end of the liquidoxygen tank to provide for increased aerodynamic stresses\nimposed by the payload. Also, for the Mercury mission the payload adapter section is modified and an abort-sensing and\nimplementation system is inco\xc2\xb7r porated. If it senses any malfunct ion in the performance of the Atlas, it triggers the Mercury\'s\nemergency escape system, and the capsule is pushed free of the\nlaunch vehicle . In the Mercury application the Atlas is 67.34\nfeet long from its engines to the capsule adapter section. With\nthe Mercury and its escape tower installed, the carrier is 95.25\nfeet in length.\nThe Atlas will no longer be needed as a space booster for NASA\nafter the Mercury spacecraft is phased out.\n\nMANNED MERCURY-ATLAS FLIGHTS\nAstronaut\n\nFebruary 20, 1962\nMay 24,1962\nOctober 3, 1962\n\n3 orbits\n3 orbits\n6 orbits\n\n[ 14]\n\nJohn H.

As men tioned previously, a n Agena D second stage\nis being developed . The Atlas- Agena is used by NASA for lunar\nand planetary missions and for launching a variety of communications and scientific satellites. The Atlas- Agena B launched\nfive R anger spacecraft during 1961 and 1962 in attempts to investigate deep space and the surface of the moon. On the first\nthree attempts the launch vehicle fai led to place the spacecraft\n[ 15 ]\n\nin its final prescribed trajectory. On the fo urth and fifth flights\nthe vehicle performed satisfactorily but the spacecraft malfunctioned. Of two Mariner missions in J uly and August, 1962, the\nfirst attempt failed due to a vehicle malfunction, but the second\nattempt placed the spacecraft in its proper trajectory.\nOn the whole, both the T hor-Agena and the Atlas-Agena combinations have proved very reliable, with a long Ii t of successful\nmissions to their credit. They are expected to be workhor es of\nthe National Launch Vehicle Program for a n umber of years.\nUntil Centaur and Saturn become operational, the Atlas-Agena\nwill perform ASA\'s heavy duty mi%ions. The ASA missions\nscheduled for this vehicle are listed below:\n\nScientific\nEccentric Geophysical\nObservatory\n\n2\n\n1963\n\nOrbit ing Astronomical\nObservatory\n\n2\n\n1963-64\n\n2\n\n1963-64\n\n9\n2\n\n1961-63\n1962\n1964\n\nCommunications\nAdvanced Passive Satellite\nLunar and Planetary\nRanger (Lunar Reconnaissance I\nMariner R (Venus Fly-by)\nMariner R (Mars Fly-by)\n\n2\n\nThe manner in which the Agena vehicle operates may be seen\nfrom the description of a Ranger flight.\nThe single-chamber rocket engine is capable, as mentioned, of\nbeing shut off and restarted in space. This operation occurs after\nthe main booster has separated from the Agena and its payload .\nIn effect, the Atlas boost the Agena and its payload through the\n\n[ 16]\n\nearth\'s atmosphere; the Agena provides the additional thrust to\ncomplete the mission.\nDuring a lunar investigation mission such as planned for the\nRanger project, the outer engines of the Atlas D burn for about\n2Y2 minutes before cutting off and dropping away. The sustainer\nengine continues to burn [or an additional two minutes, by which\ntime thc vehicle has reached 80 miles altitude. Two vernier*\nengines of 1,000 pounds thrust each burn from launch for\napproximately five minutes in order to trim velocity after booster\ncutoff. They are shut off by guidance commands, and an onboard computer commands the Atlas airborne guidance system to\nstart the timer on the Agena stage.\nAfter the verniers are cut ofT the Atlas-Agena coasts for about\n30 seconds. Then the spring-loaded aerodynamic shroud protecting the Ranger payload is discarded. Explosive charges\nseparate the Agena from the Atlas first stage, and retrorockets on\nthe latter slow it down so that it does not in terfere with the second\nstage. The Agena goes through a pitch maneuver to bring it in\nhorizontal alignment with the earth\'s surface. When this is\naccomplished, the timer sends a signal to the propulsion system\nand ignition oq;:urs.\nThis period of powered flight lasts an additional 20 minutes,\nduring which time the Agena stage is controlled by the hydraulic\ncontrol system, with corrections being supplied by an infrared\nhorizon-sensing device. When the Agena engine cuts off, the\nRanger payload is in a circular parking orbit atlproximately 100\nmiles above the earth. After a 14-minute coasting period, the\nAgena engine relights and powers the payload for another 1Y2\nminutes, placing it in the lunar trajectory. About 20 minutes\nlater the Agena and the payload are separated and the Ranger\ncontinues alone toward the moon.\n*Verniers are small rocket engines used primarily to obtain a fine\nadjustment in the velocity and trajectory of a space vehicle or missile.\n\n[ 17 ]\n\nTITAN I I\nSTAGES: 2\nPROPELLA T: Storable (a blend of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH)\nand h ydrazint-- as fuel; nitrogen tetroxide\nas oxidizer )\nTHRUST: 1st stage (XLR- 8 7), 430,000\nlbs. at sea level ; 2nd stage (XLR- 91) ,\n100,000 Ibs.\nMAXIMUM DIAMETER: 10 ft.\nHEIGHT: 90 ft. , less spacecraft\nPAYLOAD: More than 6,000 Ibs. in low\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nearth orbit\nFIRST\n\nASA LAUNCH: 1963-64\n\nUSE: Launching of the two-m an Gemini\nspacecra ft\n\nTHE Titan II, like the Atlas D,\nis an Air Force intercontinental ballistic missile which will be\nadapted by NASA for a specific mission. This carrier has been\nselected to boost into orbit the Gemini two-man spacecraft. The\nTitan II has not yet been used as a space carrier vehicle, although\nit has been flown successfully and its development is well under\nway.\n[ 18 ]\n\nIn its standard military version, the Titan II is 103 feet in\nlength and 10 feet in diameter. It consists of two tandemmounted stages, the first powered by two 215,OOO-pound-thrust\nrocket engines and the second by a single lOO,OOO-pound-thrust\nrocket engine. All engines operate on a storable hypergolic mixture of nitrogen tetroxide and a combination of unsymmetrical\ndimethylhydrazine and hydrazine.\nSince the Titan II\'s propellants are storable and ignite on contact, the missile can be readied for military use on short notice.\nThis feature is expected to facilitate NASA launches also. When\nthe Titan II becomes operational and the Gemini development is\ncompleted, United States astronauts will be able to practice\nrendezvous maneuvers in orbit to help pave the way toward\nsuccessful completion of the later Apollo program.\n\n[20 ]\n\nTITAN II I\nSTAGES: 3, plus a control module\nPROPELLANTS: Storable liquid and solid\nMAXIMUM DIAMETER: 30 ft.\nHEIGHT: More than 103 ft. , less spacecraft\nPAYLOAD: Up to 25,000 lbs. in earth orbit\nFIRST MANNED LAUNCH BY USAF:\n1965\nUSE: Launching into earth orbit of the Air\nForce\'s X - 20 (Dynasoar ) spacecraft\n\n[ 21]\n\nTITAN III is the first launch\nvehicle to be developed by the Department of Defense from the\noutset as a space booster. All current military space boosters are\nintermediate range or intercontinental range ballistic missiles with\nminimum modifications combined with upper stages developed\nseparately. Titan III is included in the National Launch Vehicle\nProgram.\nUsing the "building block" approach, the Titan III vehicle will\nconsist of five basic parts: the storable liquid propellant stages\n(XLR-87 and XLR-91 ) of the Titan II, a new storable liquid\npropellant upper stage producing 16,000 pounds of thrust; a control module, and a pair of 120-inch-diameter segmented strap-on\nsolid propellant motors.\nDepending upon the job to be performed, Titan III may be\nused in either of two standard configurations: (1) the core configuration consisting of a modified Titan II with the new upper\nstage and controL module mounted on top, which has a lift-off\nt~rust of 430,000 pounds; or (2) the Titan II core with two\nfive-segment strap-on solid motors attached, comprising the first\nboosting stage with a lift-off thrust of over two million pounds\n(each solid motor develops over one million pounds ) . In addition the Titan III program calls for the development of a powerful new solid-propellant, first-stage booster.\n\n[ 22]\n\nCENTAUR\nSTAGES: 2\nPROPELLANT: 1st stage, liquid oxygen\nan d kerosene (LOX/RP ); 2nd stage,\nliquid oxygen and liquid h ydrogen\n(LOX/ LH )\nTHRUST: Atlas D , 367,000 lbs, at sea\nlevel ; Atlas D sustainer, 80,000 lbs. ; Centaur, 30,000 Ibs.\nMAXIMUM DIAMETER: 10 ft. , excluding fins\nHEIGHT: 100 ft. , less spacecraft\nPAYLOAD: 8,500 Ibs. in 300 n.m. orbit;\n2,300 Ibs. escape; 1,300 Ibs. to Mars or\nVenus\nFIRST NASA LAUNCH: May 1962\nUSE: L aunching of earth satellites and\nlunar an d planetary exploration missions.\n\nT\n\nHE Centaur is expected to be a\nhigh-performance, general-purpose launch vehicle for use by the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Department of Defense. It requires a pioneer research effort to develop\na rocket vehicle to utilize high-energy liquid hydrogen as fuel.\nCentaur represents such an effort and , as such, will provide much\n\n[23]\n\nof the basic knowledge required for the design of the upper stages\nof the Saturn and Nova rocket vehicles, and for the design of the\nRover nuclear-propulsion system, all of which will use the same\nfuel. In addition, Centaur vehicles can carry ion and arc jet\nelectrical propulsion systems for flight tests, and the Mariner B\nprobes intended for the Nation\'s exploration of the planets Venus\nand Mars. Centaur will also perform a vital function as a vehicle\nfor preliminary unmanned exploration of the moon\'s surface\n(Project Surveyor), and for biomedical flights to help predict the\neffects on man of various types of radiation encountered in space.\nThe Centaur can carry 8,500 pounds into low earth orbit or\nabout a ton on a flight to the moon. Es entially, .the Centaur\nconsists of an Atlas first stage redesigned to carry a radically different kind of upper stage producing almo t twice the thrust of\nthe Agena B. The Centaur second stage has two engines, each\nproducing 15,000 pounds of thrust. The liquid hydrogen used\nas a propellant is a rocket fuel with great promise but which\ndemands major research and development achievements. The\ntemperature of liquid hydrogen is minus 423 \xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit, just 36\xc2\xb0\nabove absolute zero. It i so cold that it must be carefully insulated from the liquid oxygen used as oxidizer- which itself has\na temperature of 297\xc2\xb0 below zero.\nAlthough the first developmental vehicle launch was unsuccessful, the vehicle development flight program is scheduled\nfor completion by the last half of 1964, whereupon Centaur will\nbegin extensive service as an operational space mission launch\nvehicle.\n\nCENTAUR MISSIONS\nUnmanned Soft Lunar Land ings\nPrecise Luna r O rbiters\nObservation of Venus and Mars\n\n[24 ]\n\nSATURN\nTHE Saturn launch vehicle now\nconsists of two separate configurations utilizing identical first\nstages. These configurations are thc C-l and the C-1B. The\nC-1 was conceived in 1958 to provide an carly capability for large\npayloads. Existing components were utilized wherever possible.\nThe dccision to arrange the engines and tanks in clusters permitted the u e of equipment developed for the Nation\'s ballistic\nmissile programs. Thus the first stage of the Saturn C-l has a\ncluster of eight H-l engines, each capable of generating 188,000\npounds of thrust. The second stage employs six liquid-oxygen,\nliquid-hydrogen RLIO-A-3 engine, each generating 15,000\npounds of thrust. The A-3 is the same engine used in the upper\nstage of the Centaur.\nA ten-vehicle, flight development program, comprising four live\nfirst-stage flights and six live first- and second-stage flights, is\ncurrently underway. The Saturn C-l has had two successful\nlaunches. The first launching of the booster, with inert upper\nstages, occurred at Cape Canaveral in October 1961. During this\n8-minute flight, the rocket reached a peak velocity of 3,600 miles\nper hour and an altitude of 85 miles before impacting in the\nAtlantic about 215 miles downrange. Another fully successful\nlaunching took place on April 25, 1962. The eight engines generated 1.3 million pounds of thrust. The dummy upper stages\nwere filled with water as ballast, to simulate the weight of a complete vehicle.\nA bonus scientific experiment ("Project Highwater") was performed during the second launch. The 95 tons of water carried\nas ballast was deliberately released by explosion at 65 miles altitude to determine the effects in the cold vacuum of space. This\nexperiment may be repeated in the third launching.\nThe Saturn C-l will be used for orbital launchings of developmental models of manned lunar landing craft.\n(25 J\n\n(C- J CONFIGURATION )\n\nSTAGES : 2\nPROPELLANTS: 1st stage, liquid oxygen a nd kerosene (LOX/RP ); 2nd\nstage, liquid oxygen a nd liquid hydrogen (LOX/LH )\nTHR US T: 1st stage (sfI ) , 1,500,000\nIbs. at sea level ; 2nd stage (S- IV ),\n90,000 Ibs. in a vacuum\nMAXIMUM DIAMETER: 2 1.6 ft. , excluding fin s\nHEIGHT: 125 ft ., less spacecra ft\nPA YLOAD: 20,000 lbs. in 300 n.m . orbit (15,000 Ibs. without restart capability)\nFIRST ASA LAU CH: 1st stage, October 27, 1961 ; 2nd stage , 1963\nUSE: Launching into earth orbit of\nspacecraft being developed for the\nmann ed l unar la nding program\n\n[26]\n\n(C- IB CONFIGURATION)\n\nSTAGES : 2\nPROPELLANTS: 1st stage, liquid oxygen and\nkerosene (LOX/RP); 2nd stage, liquid oxygen and hydrogen (LOX/LH)\nTHRUST: 1st stage (S- I) , 1,500,000 Ibs. a t\nsea level ; 2nd stage (S-IVB) , 200,000 lbs. in\na vacuum\nMAXIMUM DIAMETER: 21.6 ft. , excluding\nfins\nHEIGHT: Approximately 150 ft., less spacecraft\nPAYLOAD: 32,000 Ibs. in 100 n.m. orbit\nFIRST NASA LAUNCH: 1965\nUSE: Launching into earth orbit of the Apollo\nspacecraft with its Lunar Excursion Module\n(LEM), as well as the launching of unmanned\npayloads in support of the manned lunar\nlanding program\n\nT\nHE\n\nSaturn C- IB\nwill give tJte United States a launch vehicle\ncapable of placing a heavier payload into\nearth orbit than will be possible with the\nSaturn C- l.

The Advanced Saturn, also called the Saturn C-5, will be almost twice\nthe height of the Saturn C-IB and will have a lift-off weight with\npayload of more than six million pounds. The first stage will be\npowered by five F-l engines yielding a total of 7.5 million pounds\nof thrust. The second stage of the Advanced Saturn will be\npowered by five J-2 engines, each producing 200,000 pounds of\nthrust at altitude. The third stage will consist of a single J-2\nengine. With this combination the Advanced Saturn will be\ncapable of launching 120 tons into low earth orbit, 45 tons on\nlunar missions, or 35 tons on planetary missions.\nThe Advanced Saturn\'s tremendous lift-off force is produced\nby the F-l engine, which has the same amount of thrust-1.5\nmillion pounds-as all eight of the H-l engines in the first stage\nof the Saturn C-l and C-IB. The F- l engine has already been\nstatic fired in full-duration tests.\nThe Advanced Saturn will be capable of sending the three-man\nApollo spacecraft into orbit around the moon. The lunar landing\nwill be accomplished by the two-man Lunar Excursion Module\n(LEM), which will be detached from the Apollo. After the\nlanding mission is completed, the LEM will take off from the\nmoon to make rendezvous with the Apollo in lunar orbit for the\nreturn journey to earth.\n\n[301\n\nH-l\n188,000 LBS,\nOXYGEN/KEROSENE\n\nF-l\n\n1,500,000 LBS,\nOXYGEN/KEROSENE\n\nM-l\n1,200,000 LBS,\nOXYGEN / HYDROGEN\n\nJ-2\n200,000 LBS.\nOXYGEN / HYDROGEN\n\nA-3\n15,000 LBS.\nOXYGEN / HYDROGEN\n\nENGINES FOR MANNED FLIGHT\n\nNOVA\nTHE largest vehicle in the current National Launch Vehicle Program is the Nova. The exact\nsize has not yet been determined. Nova will have a single-launch\nweight-lifting capability of two to three times that of the Advanced Saturn. Inasmuch as the Advanced Saturn capability is\napproximately 45 tons to escape velocity or 120 ton to earth\norbit, Nova is presently defined as being capable of launching\n240 to 360 tons to earth orbit.\nPotential missions utilizing this larger weight-lifting capability\ninclude:\n1. Delivery of passengers~nd cargo to earth orbit for assembly\nof spacecraft and escape stages for manned interplanetary exploration.\n2. Delivery of passengers and cargo to the lunar surface for\nlunar missions.\n3. Delivery of passengers and cargo to earth orbit for establishing and supplying large space stations.\n4. Direct escape for interplanetary probes.\nNova will utilize two stages for orbital mis ions and three\nstages for escape missions. The vehicle will be about 300 feet in\nheight, exclusive of its payload. The first a~ second stages will\nbe about 50 feet in diameter. Both liquid and solid propellants\nare being studied for possible use in the first stage. The second\nand third stages will use high-energy liquid-oxygen, liquid-hydrogen propellants. Nova will be capable of accepting a nuclearpowered third stage when such a stage is developed and available.\nDuring fiscal year 1963, NASA is carrying out intensive configuration studies to determine the size, propulsion system characteristics, and vehicle technology.\n\n[31\n\n1\nCPo\n\n191:>2 0 -66J324\n\n'
