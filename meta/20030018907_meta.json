This method uses, in general, the engines and straight or closed-loop cables disposed on a planet surface. The installation consists of a space apparatus, power drive stations located along trajectory of the apparatus, the cables connected to the apparatus and to the power stations, a system for suspending the cable, and disconnected device. The drive stations accelerate the apparatus up to hypersonic speed. The estimations and computations show the possibility of making these projects a reality in a short period of time (see attached project: launcher for missiles and loads). The launch will be very cheap $1-$2 per LB. We need only light strong cable, which can be made from artificial fibers, whiskers, nanotubes, which exist in industry and scientific laboratories.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030018907, "endDate": "2002-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "53rd International Astronautical Congress: The World Space Congress", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "a21fb835183846e494067fce5285e1d9", "startDate": "2002-10-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030018907, "id": "9f987124f79941a5a7a869b46e8f6353", "publicationDate": "2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030018907.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030018907/downloads/20030018907.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030018907/downloads/20030018907.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030018907/downloads/20030018907.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
