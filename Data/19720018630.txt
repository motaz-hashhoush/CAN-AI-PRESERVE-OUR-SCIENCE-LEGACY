b"Recreational Uses\nELBERTCOX\nCommission of Outdoor Recreation\nCommonwealth of Virginia\n\nLike other agencies, the Commission of Outdoor Recreation can benefit from the application of space-age\ntechnology in its field of operation. The Commission's responsibility is to gather pertinent information on the\nrecreation supply and needs of the Commonwealth and from these data prepare and update a statewide comprehensive\noutdoor recreation plan: the Virginia Outdoors Plan.\nThe Virginia Outdoors Plan outlines, in detail, recreation plans for the entire State. The plan calls for certain areas to\nbe set aside as state parks, local and regional parks, scenic highways, byways and parkways, natural areas, scenic rivers,\nand public game and fish management areas. The Commission's interest in the Chesapeake Bay area also includes the\ndevelopment of private outdoor recreation projects and any problems which relate to protection of the outdoors and\nthe natural environment. An example is the Commission's involvement in the primary environmental effects ofdredging\nand landfill upon estuarine areas. To this end, the Commission reviews and offers comments on dredging applications\nand related projects as they are proposed.\nAn initial problem in comprehensive outdoor recreation planning is the availability of data. Suggestions for possible\ndevelopment must be followed up by detailed investigation. Information must .be gathered relating to topography,\nground water conditions, biotic life, access to surface water, and surrounding land use. Much of this needed information\nis quickly discernible from high-altitude infrared color photography as well as from conventional black-and-white air\nphotography. As we gather experience we foresee the desirability of thermal infrared photography to detect trends in\nenvironmental evolution.\nThe greatest advantage we anticipate at this time is increased speed of interpretation from existing coverage. Without\npresently obtainable overflight viewing we must require advance scheduling of field trips, running into several months'\ntime. Often this means the difference between acquisition or loss of a critical land parcel.\nAt the present time we could utilize high altitude imagery for study of the recreational potential of such areas as\nFisherman's Island, the Barrier Islands, and potential bayside state park locations on the Eastern Shore.We can also\nobtain preliminary material from 1969 and 1970 imagery without waiting for the completion, later this year, of the\nRecreation and Tourism Study of the Eastern Shore.1\nAt present, we are looking forward to the results of a study of experimental applications of remote sensing\ntechniques to outdoor recreation planning.2 This experimental study will provide a good opportunity to test\napplication of remote sensing technology in the collection of data for outdoor recreation planning. We feel that after\nthe study has been completed, we will have a better understanding of the most appropriate ways to incorporate remote\nsensing data into the recreation planning process. We can then suggest lines of further action and analysis.\n1\nThe study is being conducted by the Virginia Division of State Planning and Community Affairs with financial assistance from the\nEconomic Development Administration of the United States Department of Commerce.\n2\nThis study is being conducted by the Department of Environmental Sciences of the University of Virginia under the direction of\nWallace E. Reed and H. Grant Goodell. The experimental proposal was submitted to the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation.\n\n103\n\n"
