Gemini crewmen : proved\nthat man can exist in a weightless environment for at least 14 days (twice the number\nof days required for a lunar landing mission) ; developed the techniques of rendezvous and docking, so vital to the Apollo Program; and proved i t is feasible to place one\nspace vehicle into orbit and utilize it later to\nfurnish propellant power for docked vehicles.\nThe Gemini crewmen also proved that\nextravehicular activity for relatively long\nperiods of time is feasible and that man is\ncapable of performing certain duties while\noutside the spacecraft.\n\nA.\n\nAstronauts prepare for space flight.\n\nB.

This was accomplished with\nremarkable accuracy.\nMuch of the information obtained in\nMercury and Gemini is utilized in the Apollo\nProgram with its primary objective of landing astronauts on the lunar surface and\nreturning them to earth prior to 1970.\nMany persons have asked why men volunteer for such assignments. There is no\nsimple answer to this question, for each\nastronaut has strong individual characteristics. Perhaps the one characteristic found\nin each of them is a spirit of adventure-a\ndesire to explore the unknown.\nEach of the astronauts would like to be\na member of the first crew to accomplish a\nlunar mission. All realize, however, that only\nthree can fly that mission so each continues\nto participate in the extensive training programs required and thus make significant\ncontributions to the effort required for ultimate success.\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG. Astronaut in Visual Docking Simulator during rendezvous\n\xe2\x82\xacraining.\n\nasic objectives of astronaut training are:\n1. To provide highly trained\nflight crew members who are capable of operating at peak efficiency in the space environment\n- e i t h e r in normal flight or emergency situations, and\n2. To provide crew members who are\ntrained to conduct scientific experiments\nduring manned space missions either by actively participating in such experiments or by\nserving as observers on passive experiments.\nThese objectives are met, primarily,\nthrough utilization of a number of formal\ntraining courses. Such courses include technological and scientific subjects, operations\nfamiliarization, environmental and contingency training, spacecraft and launch vehicle\ndesign and development, and an aircraft\nflight program.\nThe courses in technology and science\ncover a variety of subjects such as space\nnavigation, flight mechanics, astronomy\n(with emphasis on selenology, which is the\nstudy of the moon), physics of the upper\nmosphere and spac bioastronautics,\n\n4\n\nH.

Weightlessness is experienced briefly in airplane flying\nparabolic arc.\n\nH\n\nvanced propulsion systems, aerodynamics,\nspace communications, meteorology, geology,\ngeophysics, geochemistry, guidance and control, and computer technology.\nComputers are used extensively in guidance and navigation systems in both the\nGemini and Apollo Programs. Astronauts\nassigned to Gemini flights were given a basic\ndigital computer course prior to receiving\nadvanced courses on the Gemini on-board\ncomputer. Similarly, crewmen assigned to\nApollo flights are instructed in the basic\nprinciples of inertial guidance systems in the\nApollo guidance and navigation course.\nIn the area of operations, the astronauts\nin each new group selected are given a thorough orientation on activities at NASA\ninstallations as well as at the plants of some\nof the contractors. This orientation is followed by more detailed briefings at a later\ntime. Many of the astronauts are assigned\nspecific operational duties during the manned\nflights.\nIn environmental familiarization training, astronauts are exposed to acceleration\nand deceleration g-forces, weightlessness,\nsimulated lunar gravity, vibration and noise,\n\nI\n\nand other environmental factors. To achieve\nthis, various special devices and techniques\nhad to be developed. For example, a device\nwhich supports five-sixths of the astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s\nweight is used to simulate lunar gravity.\nThis provides the feeling to the astronaut\nthat he weighs only one-sixth of his normal\nweight. Weightlessness is experienced by the\nastronauts for extremely short periods of\ntime in an aircraft which is flown in a\nparabolic arc.\nPossibility of contingency landings is\nslight but astronauts must be prepared\nfor any eventuality. Contingency training\nstresses survival techniques and is conducted\nin geographical locations where extreme environmental conditions exist. Tropical survival training is accomplished in Panama,\ndesert survival training in western desert\nareas of the United States and water survival training in the Gulf of Mexico and\nGalveston Bay, near Houston.\nAstronauts are continually involved in\nstudy of spacecraft and launch vehicles. This\ntraining is accomplished through the study\nof basic handbooks on these vehicles, through\ninstruction by NASA and contractor special-\n\nJ. Astronaut entering centrifuge for test of \xe2\x80\x9c0\xe2\x80\x9d force effects.\n\nsions, reviewing pertinent subject material,\nand becoming thoroughly familiar with the\nexperiments to be conducted on their mission. The assigned crew devotes major\nemphasis to their spacecraft. From the time\nthey are assigned to a mission, they follow\ntheir spacecraft through the final phases of\nfabrication, through the many tests performed at the factory, altitude chamber runs\nof parts of the mission with the mission\nspacecraft, through additional tests at Cape\nKennedy, and finally through the mating\nwith the launch vehicle and additional combined tests on the launch pad prior to the\nscheduled lift-off.\nPhysical fitness is very important in a\nprogram which inflicts the stresses that are\ninduced by manned space flight. All astronauts are in top physical condition when they\nare selected and NASA holds them personally responsible for maintaining such conditions. Therefore, due to the other requirements of the overall training program, each\nastronaut undertakes a physical fitness program tailored to his own needs.\n\nists, and by active participation in design\nengineering reviews and vehicle validation\ntests. This type of study and review extends\nto special equipment such as hand tools, the\nportable life support system, the tether, and\nother manned maneuvering devices, all designed for extravehicular activity; and to\npersonal equipment, such as pressure suits,\nwith different suit configurations to meet\nspecial mission requirements.\nAircraft flight training is accomplished\nprimarily in T-33 and T-38 aircraft and\neach astronaut is required to log a minimum\nof 100 hours flying time each year. They also\nreceive helicopter flight instruction because\nof the similarity of this activity to landing\nthe lunar module on the moon. Since actual\nspace flight \xe2\x80\x98opportunity is so limited, this\ntraining is vital to astronauts in maintaining\ntheir \xe2\x80\x9cflight readiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhen a crew is named for a mission, its\nmembers undertake an intensive program\ngeared to preparing them to a point of maximum efficiency for their particular flight.\nMuch time is devoted to flyinr simulated mis-\n\n6\n\nEDWIN E.
