For\nexample, a 600-ft (183-rn) air dielectric cable will\nchange phase 100 at 150 MHz when the air pressure in\nthe cable changes from zero to 20 lb/in. 2 (1.4x105\nN/m2).\nHow It's done:\nThe figure is a block diagram of the operational\ncontrols of the system.

The phase shifter is adjusted to\noperate the phase detector near zero volts. The phase\ndetector compares the phase of the 100-MHz pilot and\nthe reflected 100 MHz from the coaxial line. An\noutput indicates a change in the electrical length of\nthe coaxial line.\nThe phase detector dc output actuates a displacement servo comprising a proportional control and a\nmotor drive. Attached to the motor is a pressure\nregulator which meters the flow of dry pressurized air\nto the coaxial line in order to maintain a constant\npressure. The motor regulator being used can produce\nphase shifts which correspond to changes in electrical\nlength over a dynamic range of 8 to 12 cm per 500 ft\n(152.5 m) of cable. Additionally, it enables pressure\nregulation by venting excess coaxial line pressure to\nthe atmosphere.\n\nB74-10295\n\n\t\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed\nto:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nNASA Pasadena Office\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, California 91103\nReference: TSP74-10295\n\nPatent status:\nThis invention has been patented by NASA (U.S.\nPatent No. 3,790,906).
