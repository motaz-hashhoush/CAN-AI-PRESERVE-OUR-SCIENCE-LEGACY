None have been successful, potential distortion of the sealing faces is the primary reason. There is a film riding device that does accommodate distortion and is in service in aircraft applications, namely the foil bearing. More specifically a foil thrust bearing. These are not intended to be seals, and they do not accommodate large axial movement between shaft & static structure. By combining the 2 a unique type of face seal has been created. It functions like a normal face seal. The foil thrust bearing replaces the normal primary sealing surface. The compliance of the foil bearing allows the foils to track distortion of the mating seal ring. The foil seal has several perceived advantages over existing hydrodynamic designs, enumerated in the chart. Materials and design methodology needed for this application already exist. Also the load capacity requirements for the foil bearing are low since it only needs to support itself and overcome friction forces at the antirotation keys.", "title": "Foil Face Seal Testing", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T19:41:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20090041730, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Munson, John"}, "organization": {"name": "Rolls-Royce Corp.", "location": "Indianapolis, IN, United States"}}, "id": "6cd73a17f92644568c078fd6dd18c6cd"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20090041730, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090041730, "id": "ad555ca4f38f4045a040d3ad6c6d511e", "publicationName": "2008 NASA Seal/Secondary Air System Workshop", "publicationDate": "2009-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20090041726, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "2008 NASA Seal/Secondary Air System Workshop", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090041730.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090041730/downloads/20090041730.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090041730/downloads/20090041730.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090041730/downloads/20090041730.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
