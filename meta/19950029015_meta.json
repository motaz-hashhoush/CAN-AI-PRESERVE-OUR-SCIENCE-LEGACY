The objectives included: measuring the solar irradiance at high precision; remote sensing of the composition of the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere using techniques for wavelengths from 300 A to 5 mm; and inducing auroras by means of 1.2 amp electron beams. A subset of these instruments will subsequently be flown in a series of shuttle missions at roughly 1-year intervals over an 11-year solar cycle. The frequent recalibration opportunities afforded by such a program allows the transfer of calibrations to longer duration orbiting observatories. The ATLAS-1 mission occurred at the same time as the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), TIROS-N, and ERB satellites were in operation, and correlative measurements were conducted with these. In all, the mission was most successful in achieving its objectives and a unique and important database was acquired, with many scientific firsts accomplished. This paper provides the mission overview for the series of papers that follow.", "title": "The ATLAS-1 mission", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T21:38:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950029015, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Torr, Marsha R."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, US, United States"}}, "id": "a54093a4dcb949b6b40e2feae05b9f53"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950029015, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1016/0273-1177(94)90144-9", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "14", "submissionId": 19950029015, "issue": "9", "issn": "0273-1177", "id": "02d718bcfe3a43879cccde28d977fd9f", "publicationName": "Advances in Space Research", "publicationDate": "1994-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "id": 19950028980, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "The Earth's Middle Atmosphere: COSPAR Plenary Meeting, 29th, Washington, DC, 28 Aug.-5 Sep., 1992", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
