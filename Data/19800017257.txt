Halt, Sierra Hydrotech, Placerville, Ca.\n\nABSTRACT\nSnow covered area was examined as a parameter for estimating rate of snowmelt runoff as input to an operational\nhydro Logic mode L. SCA and surface air temperature provided a very effective means for simulating daily snowmelt runoff for the Kings River.\nINTRODUCTION\nGeneral\nThe purpose of this investigation has been to explore the\napplication of satellite imagery to hydrologic modeling of snowmelt runoff in the southern Sierra Nevada. The investigation\nhas been conducted under the sponsorship of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in conjunction with the California Applications Systems Verification and Transfer Project.\nObjectives\nThe major objective of this investigation has been to develop\nand test application of areal extent of snowcover to hydrologic\nsimulation of daily snowmeLt runoff on the Kings River basin in\nCalifornia\'s southern Sierra Nevada. The California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) currently operates a hydrologic model to simulate daily runoff on the Kings River basin for\noperational purposes. Although previous investigation leading to\nthe Kings River model suggested that areal extent of snowcover\ninfluences rate as well as remaining volume of snowmelt, techniques had not been developed to incorporate this parameter in\nthe operational model, since at that time, only intermittent\nobservations of snowcovered area by low flying aircraft were\navailable.\nThis investigation was intended to (1) explore techniques for\napplication of snowcovered area (SCA) to the existing Kings\n\n201\n\nRiver hydrologic model, (2)deveLop and describe SCA-snowmelt\nrelationships in a manner to make the technique readily transferable to other similar watersheds, and (3) develop techniques for\ninterpolating and extrapolating SCA for operational use on a daily\nbasis from satellite observations as well as precipitation and\ntemperature data. This investigation by Sierra Hydrotech has\nbeen considered complimentary to "Operational Applications of\nSatellite Snowcover Observations in California" currently being\nconducted by the California Cooperative Snow Survey Branch,\n(CDWR) and sponsored by NASA.\nBACKGROUND\nGeneral\nWater originating from snowmelt in California\'s southern\nSierra Nevada has high value for municipal and agricultural\napplication. Detailed information on the volume and rate of snowmelt runoff through operational hydrologic forecasts is important in water management decision making. For half a century,\nmeasurements of snowpack water content have been made on a\nmonthly basis in these watersheds for the purpose of estimating\nvolume of runoff, and for over 20 years, aircraft observations\nof the areal extent of snowpack were made. Satellite observation\nof areal extent of snowcover have been interpreted for each\nsnowmelt season since 1973.\nStudy Area Description\nThe Kings River is a southern Sierra Nevada watershed\n(Figure 1) that discharges into the Central Valley near Fresno,\nCalifornia. The basin ranges in elevation from below 300 m in the\nfoothill areas to over 4300 m along the Sierra Nevada crest, which\nis the eastern boundary of the watershed. The Kings River has\nan east-west orientation with high subbasin divides and subbasin\ndrainage in deep canyons. The average elevation of the April 1\nsnow line is about 1900m, although late winter and early spring\nstorms may cause a temporary drop, or "transient" snow tine,\nLasting sometimes only a few days. The distribution of area\nwith elevation is relatively uniform within the area of major\nmelt contribution between 1900 m and 3600 m elevation.\nThe 4000 km 2 Kings River basin has an average annual runoff\nof 1, 568, 000 acre-feet (1934x10 6 m 2 ) which represents 480 mm\nof runoff, 75 percent of which occurs during the ApriL-July\nsnowmelt period.

Average annual precipitation\nat the 2800m elevation is about 900 mm. Winter precipitation\nmeasurements made along the frontal slope at the western side\nof the basin appear to be representative of, or at least proportional to, precipitation at the higher elevations, making these\ndata useful for hydrologic analysis within the basin. Precipitation\nand resulting runoff are extremely variable from season to season\nin the southern Sierra, emphasizing the importance and need for\nan adequate hydrologic analysis for operational requirements.\nHYDROLOGIC MODELING\nGeneral\nA model represents a technique for mathematically simulating\nphysical processes or relationships. A hydrologic model consists\nof mathematical relationships representing the various hydrologic processes occurring within the watershed. A hydrologic\nmodel may be designed to simulate daily flow from a watershed\nutilizing various hydrologic and climatologic parameters, resulting in output which can provide timely hydrologic analysis for\nwater management decisions. Hydrologic models are not specific\nforecasts nor are they intended to provide forecasts in the same\nsense as weather forecasts. Models provide the technology to\nenable the hydrologists to evaluate the effect upon runoff of\nvarious sequences of climatologic or meteorologic events which\nmay represent either historical or hypothetical occurrences.\nDescription of Existing Model\nDigital hydrologic models have been developed and used as\nwater management tools in the southern Sierra Nevada since the\nsnowmelt season of 1969, when a hydrologic model was developed for simulation of daily / runoff during the snowmelt season\nfor the Kings River basin._ _ The Kings River hydrologic\nmodel, and a similar model for the San Joaquin River, are\noperated weekly during each snowmelt season by CDWR.\nThe existing Kings River hydrologic model 1/ evolved through\ndevelopment of several submodels representing various runoff\nprocesses as illustrated in Figure 2. The general mathematical\ncharacteristics of each submodel were developed and fit to\napproximately 25 years of observed data. The Kings River\nhydrologic model consists of five basic submodels of varying\n\n204\n\nW\nC7\n\nO\n\nv\n\n^\n\nz\nO\t\n\na\t\n\n+\n\n+\n\nW\n^a\n\nW\n\nH\t\nJ\n\nW\n\nU\nQ\n\nv\n\n^-\n\nf0\nN\n\nT\n\nwv\t\nW\t\n\n1\n\n-1-.\n\nfL\n\nzv\nW\n\n_\t\n\n\xc2\xa2>- Q\nf- J 2\n\nW\n^ V\n\nZQ\n\nW\n\nU\nOO (n\nr \xe2\x80\x94\n\nNm\n\nW\n\n3m\n\no\n\na\n\nv\n\nx\n\nw\n\nW Z\nw\n\nw\n\nOU W\nm\nmY7 0\n\nm <^ 1\'Q\nmw\nmom\nN w LL 0\naw\n\nw\t\n\nw W LL\nFd mF- W\n\nWz WF\n~ O U\' 2\nU) (5\n\nF\t\n\n0.

A file of historic conditions in the computer permits the hydrologist to analyze runoff sequences subsequent to\nthe date of analysis as they might have occurred under temperature and precipitation regimes from any one of nearly 30 historic\nyears or to investigate ranges and probabilities from the entire\ndata set. Projected or hypothetical temperatures and precipitation regimes may also be used if desired.\nORIGINAL SNOWMELT SUBMODEL DESCRIPTION\nAs a result of the importance of snowmelt runoff, the snowmelt submodel was of prime importance in development of the\noriginal Kings River hydrologic model and received the greatest\namount of developmental work, resulting in the most complex\nsubmodel in the system (Figure 2). The snowmelt submodel\nrepresents total runoff from the snowpack, both surface flow and\nflow which passes through "recession storage". The contribution to mean daily flow derived from snowmelt has varied from\nzero to approximately 750 m 3 /sec, depending upon size of\nseason and time of year.\nIn the original Kings River hydrologic model, daily snowmelt\n\n206\n\nvolume was based upon total quantity of snowpack, degree of\nsnowpack priming, volume of remaining snowmelt runoff, and\nmean daily air temperature as an index to the effect of avaiLable\nenergy on snowpack. A portion of the daily melt was passed\nthrough recession storage and the remainder was distributed by\na four-day unit hydrograph. The original snowmelt model\nproved to be very effective under most conditions, in spite of\nits very empirical nature.\nThe final report on the original model stated that both snowpack volume and SCA are related to melt rate. However, the\nSCA relationship was not defined in that investigation. It should\nbe pointed out that relationships between the remaining volume\nand rate of snowmelt runoff may still prove useful in operational\nanalysis of runoff subsequent to the last date of satellite observation.\nSCA SNOWMELT SUBMODEL - DEVELOPMENT AND\nDESCRIPTION\nGeneral Approach\nThe objective of this investigation was to develop techniques\nusing SCA as a parameter to estimate the rate of snowmelt contribution as input to the Kings River hydrologic model. Although\nprevious investigation Leading to the Kings River model suggested that areal extent of snowcover influenced rate of snowmelt\nrunoff, the technique had not been developed to incorporate this\nparameter in the operational model. Utilization of SCA required\na relationship between the rate of snowmelt contribution to the runoff hydrograph and temperature, SCA, and related parameters\nwhich would permit simulation of daily snowmelt runoff from the\nhydrologic model. The original snowmelt submodeL was completely\nremoved from the hydrologic model and replaced by the SCA submodel, since the basic techniques used in the two submodeLs\ndiffered conceptually.\nThe SCA snowmelt submodel is based upon the following\npremises:\n. . . The technique was to be capable of transference to other\nsimilar watersheds given the comparable characteristics of those watersheds. It was hypothesized that the\ngreatest degree of transference could be achieved\nthrough development of the snowmelt submodeL by elevation bands or zones within the watershed, basing the\n\n207\n\nmelt procedures upon similar and differing characteristics of the zones as well as relative levels of energy input.\n. . . Melt in any elevation zone in the basin can be related to\nair temperature within that zone.\n. . . Melt of snowpack may occur at any point or elevation\nzone in the watershed (assuming air temperatures are\nabove freezing in that zone), but runoff will occur from\nthe snowpack in a given elevation zone only after the\nsnowpack in that zone becomes fully "primed". For\npurposes of the snowmeLt submodel, the effective\n"elevation of prime" represents that elevation above\nwhich no snowmeLt is available to the snowmeLt hydrograph.\n. . . The rate at which snowmett is made available to the\nsnowmett hydrograph is proportional to the area of fully\nprimed snowpack within each elevation zone below the\n"elevation of prime" as well as the temperature within\neach zone.\nBasic Data - Elevation Zones and Temperatures\nFigures 3 and 4 show various types of basic data used as input\nto the SCA snowmeLt submodel and the Kings River hydrologic\nmodel. The following comments refer specifically to basic data\nas related to the SCA snowmeLt submodel.\nIn the development phase, SCA was interpreted from satellite\nimagery by 150 m (500 foot) elevation bands or zones. It should\nbe pointed out that the developmental model using elevation zones\nof snowpack is not particularly well suited to operational forecasting as the reduction of satellite imagery by 150 m elevation\nzones is a time consuming process. This approach is better left\nto the research and developmental stages of analysis, while a\nmore simplified approach to data reduction is more applicable to\noperational analysis during the forecast season. Fortunately, in\nthe Kings River watershed, the basinwide SCA seems to provide\nan adequate index to be used in future operational work, while\nanalysis by zones provides for a means of transference of techniques to other areas and watersheds.\nTemperature used in analysis is mean daily surface air temperature derived from three stations in or adjacent to the watershed and adjusted to an approximate elevation of 2100 m for\n208\n\n=\n\xc2\xae\nR\n\n\\^(_\nKui2f\nJ^Suy\n:>:xa>/\nu cr\nc z\n\nJ\n\\ W\no D\nk\no m\n\n\\\n>uu\nX00\np Qo\nz/=\nX7 4\n\\_^\n\n0\n\n2\n\xc2\xae z O\n\\ / / _j\n\n_\n`\t \xc2\xb0\n\nI W\n\n/\t\n\nLLI\n\n(^\\_A U)\n\n\\ %\n% O\n\nLd z }\\\n\n^t\t >\xc2\xae\na ;a^z\n\n;\n\no\n\nZ\ng m\n\n/ <\n-\n\nf\n\n\xc2\xb0\n2> = 7\n\\t a G S\n-\n\n_/5(\nCL\n3\n`^^k^\n\n(^ys)\n- _\n\t\nCr<\n\n(\\o^^\n\nLL\n)UJ\nE\n_\t\nSI;\n-\t\nR\njt$ww0\n\n^\n\\/\ne:\n\xc2\xbb^E\n\xc2\xae/\xc2\xa7\n\\}a\n\nA\n\n2\n_\n}\n0 0 >\n\n\xc2\xb0 ^`\n^(2^(^\n\xc2\xa7\\\\)(\n\n^^\\^\n\nR\nQ\n\n^^<//\n\nE e\n\nr}j\n\xc2\xa7i\nu W\n\nE ^\n\n<\nc\n\nou\n<rz\n\n=)22\n2,=z\n\n\xc2\xa5\n\n%\n\n(<2\n\xc2\xa7r,\n/\n\n2\n\nCL\n\nID\n\nz\n[ m (\\\n\\ \xc2\xa7\\\xc2\xa7\n\xc2\xb0\n\n^\xc2\xa7u/\n2^` %\n^\xc2\xa7!\n^Sb/\n\n^)\\}\n\\a. 0x\n_\t s\n00zai\n\xc2\xa7 :\xc2\xa5z w\na\n\n_\t\n\n;\n\ntG\t\n\\$\t\n\nK\n;\n,\n\\\n\n209\n\n\\\n\nzx)\n3\xc2\xb0R^\n^\xc2\xa2f;\ns\t >\n}\n\n7)./\n\\jam \\\xc2\xae\na.\n\nuj\n\n0\nC)\n\nZ/\nR \xc2\xae=\n3/\xc2\xa7\n5 2\n\n\t\n\n^.\t\n\nO\t\n\n4\t\n\no\t\na.\t\n\n~\t\n\nv\t\n\nO\t\n\nma\t\n\n\xc2\xb0\t\n\n-^\t\n\nN\t\n\n^\n\nWU,\n\nm\t\n_vi\t\nzw\na\t\n3m\t\n\noiro\t\nr\t\nf ^Ld\t\nQ\t\n\nN\t m\n\n0^\n= H a U\nJ=\nO\n~oo\n\nw\t\ncr\n\nW\t\nO\nm\nI-\t\n\nW\t\nO O\t\n\n==\n\nV\t Q\nWF " K\n2ZO\n\nE\n(C w O^\nCO N\n\nNr\t 7 o\n0 m\t\n\nQ\n\nF- U LL 0\n\nNw\np^\n\n=\n\nWW\ni\nrd m a LW\n:Z) w Q D O\nJ WZ\noa Q E\nO\t a F\nw\t\n\nZ\n\n_\n0\n\nW\t\n:r\nQ\n7J\t\nr\nMW\nZ0\nN}O o\nK\nN\t\np\t m\n=\n\nW\nn u O\nC W W\nCL\nr N\n\nFw- w 0\nO f W\nN\n\nf ?

Air temperature is one of the few measurements related to the input of energy to the watershed which has\nbeen recorded systematically over the years. Fortunately, temperature appears to provide a good integration of the effect of available energy upon the snowpack under most conditions, both during\naccumulation and melt of the snowpack. Temperature within each\nelevation zone was based on the mean daily model temperature\ncomputed with a Lapse rate of 6. 4 o C/km. Analysis indicated that\na base temperature of -1 0 C appeared to give the most satisfactory results. Melt was computed on the basis of the difference between the mean daily temperature (adjusted by lapse rate) and -1\'C.\nMelt b y Zones\nThe snowmelt submodei was first developed for that portion of\nthe season after which the entire watershed was considered to be\nprimed and producing melt. This simplified the process of developing and calibrating techniques to catcuLate melt by elevation\nzones. The same basic technique is utilized throughout the entire\nsnowmelt season, but during the period of priming, only a portion\nof the SCA in the watershed has the ability to produce water contributing to the runoff hydrograph.\nOperation of the existing model uses input data in conventional\nunits and output for operational analysis is also in similar units.\nThe SCA snowmelt submodeLwas similarly developed in the conventional system. However, the following equations are shown in SI\nunits. Melt volume for each elevation zone is computed by the\nfollowing equation according to the flow chart in Figure 3.\nEquation 1\t\n\nQMELTz = CgCzAzPzTz\n\nWhere: QMELT z = daily melt volume from given elevation\nzone "z" expressed as a mean daily flow\nrate, m3/sec\nCq = coefficient to describe relationship between\narea, temperature and melt. The value\nof Cq was about 0. 024\nC z = coefficient to adjust for the efficiency within the elevation zone. Values were near\n1. 0, probably dependent upon loss characteristics of the zone\n\n211\n\nAz = area within elevation zone in square\nkilometers\nPz = percentage of the zone subject to melt on a\ngiven day limited by SCA in zone and "elevation of prime" as described in the following section\nTz = effective temperature above base within\nelevation zone "z", oC.\nThe summation of QMELT from all zones is the output from\nthe SCA snowmelt submodel and the required input for the Kings\nRiver hydrologic model. A value of QMELT for any elevation zone\nwas calculated as zero (1) if there was no SCA within the zone,\nand (2) if the temperature for the zone was Less than -1 0 C, or\n(3) if the effective elevation of prime was lower limit of the zone.\nAlthough analysis suggests that the relationship between temperature and melt is not linear, it appears to be sufficiently Linear\nthroughout the range of temperature where significant melt\noccurs that the assumption of the linear relationship is not detrimental. One degree C change in temperature with this relationship represents about 2 mm of QMELT as input to the basic\nhydrologic model. This figure does not appear at all inconsistent\nwith observed depletion of snowpack of 50 mm per day with observed mean daily air temperature (corrected for elevation) in the\norder of 200C.\nMelt During Prime\n\nAnalysis of melt volume and melt rate during the period of\nsnowpack priming is complicated by the fact that the snowpack is\nnot fully primed throughout the watershed, and therefore the watershed is not capable of producing runoff from the entire SCA, no\nmatter what the temperature. It has been assumed for purposes\nof the model that the watershed produces no snowmelt runoff\nabove the "elevation of prime" and all of the runoff required to\nmeet the observed hydrograph of snowmelt runoff comes from the\narea of the watershed which is snowcovered below the effective\n"elevation of prime". It was assumed that a given set of temperature and SCA conditions would produce snowmeit volume equivalent to that derived from the relationship in section "Melt by\nZones", and that any reduction or difference between the calculated and observed melt was attributable to the fact that no runoff occurred above an "elevation of prime", regardless of\ntemperature.\n\n212\n\nTo systematically develop relationships to describe the\n"elevation of prime", the basinwide melt was calculated from the\nrelationship in section "Melt by Zones". Next, the volume of\ndaily melt required to reproduce the observed hydrograph was\nestimated. The difference between the calculated and "observed"\nmelt volumes was then used to determine the elevation above\nwhich no snowmelt could occur if the "observed" runoff hydrograph were to be realized from "calculated" melt. This elevation\nwas defined for purposes of the SCA snowmelt model as the\neffective "elevation of prime". The elevation of prime was then\ndefined in terms of other measured or calculated parameters\nconsidered related to the priming process. Many combinations\nof parameters were tested to establish a relationship between\nit\n\t of prime" and the following factors.\n. . . Temperature -- A decayed accumulative temperature\n(0. 96 daily decay factor) was based upon the accumulation of degree days above freezing at 2100m from\nJanuary 1. This factor represented a measure of the\naccumulation of energy to which the snowpack might be\nsubjected as reflected by air temperature.\nDate -- The date of the season also appears to reflect\nsome measure of energy introduced to the snowpack that\nwould be somewhat independent of temperature.\nSnowpack Water Content -- Apri1 1 snowpack water content (expressed in percentage of average April 1 water\ncontent), updated for subsequent precipitation, was used\nto describe the amount of snowpack which must be primed\nbefore runoff would occur. The greater the water content of the snowpack, the slower the elevation of prime\nwould rise.\nThe basic equation for computation of elevation of prime for\nthe Kings River SCA snowmelt submodet took the following form:\nEquation 2\t\n\nWhere:\t\n\nE = 945K((1. 009) D + . 00987(T1- 55.5))\nK\nE = the elevation of prime in metres\nD = number of days since February 1\nT1 = decayed accumulated temperature ( o C days\nat 2100 m) since January 1 with a decay\nfactor of 0. 96\n\n213\n\nK = a variable affecting the elevation of prime as\nrelated to snowpack water content (HSI). K\ndecreases with increasing HSI\nHSI = high snow index expressed as a percentage of\naverage April 1 water content, adjusted for\nsubsequent precipitation.\nThe resulting elevation of prime represents the maximum elevation to which the watershed is fully primed and capable of producing snowmett (for purposes of model computation) as of the given\ndate. A flow diagram for calculation of the elevation of prime\nappears in Figure 3.\nGenerally during the spring snowmett period, the elevation of\nprime wilt continue to increase as the season progresses. However, spring storms may deposit new snowpack at lower elevations.\nUsually this pack is transient and may melt in a few days with\nlittle increase in rate or volume of runoff. Snowmelt is often retarded below what might be expected with the increased area of\nsnowpack until the freshly fallen snow has become primed. Occasionally, heavy precipitation may occur and some substantial\nincrease in water supply and rate of runoff may be noted from the\nnew snowpack. This hydrologic process has been modeled to\nforce the elevation of prime to drop when the snow line drops,\nand then increase at a rate dependent upon temperature until it\nequals the calculated elevation of prime in the basic equation. If\nthe snow Line drops, the elevation of prime is required to drop a\nlike amount. On each subsequent day, the elevation of prime\nrises at a rate equal to the rise in snow line plus an additional\nrise related to the 2100 m temperature.\nCompute Snowmett and Runoff Hydrograph\nA flow diagram for the Kings River hydrologic model with the\nSCA snowmelt submodel is shown in Figure 4. Daily calculation of\nmelt to eventually appear as surface runoff from calculation of\nindividual elevation zone melt volumes (figure 3) results in the\nvolume of daily snowmelt available for distribution as runoff in\nthe main model. A portion of the volume of melt is directed\nthrough "recession storage\'\', dependent upon the current level in\nstorage which, from a hydrologic standpoint, would represent\nhow wet the basin had been. After addition of a portion of the\ndaily volume of melt to recession storage, recession storage is\ndepleted at approximately six percent of total volume per day to\nform the recession flow. Recession storage has the capability of\n\n214\n\nsmoothing a portion of the snowmeLt by distributing it over many\ndays as it is released from this temporary model storage. The\nremaining volume of snowmeLt is distributed by a four-day unit\nhydrograph to produce the temperature related fluctuations\nnoted in the observed runoff hydrograph.\nDaily computed volumes of runoff distributed from recession\nstorage and direct snowmelt runoff distributed by unit hydrograph\nare added to winter base flow, summer base flow, and precipitation flow derived from other submodels in the Kings River hydroLogic model. The net result is a simulation of total mean daily\ndischarge. During the period of maximum snowmelt runoff in\nseasons with average snowpack water content, the snowmelt submodel (including water distributed through recession storage) may\naccount for 95 percent or more of the total mean daily flow.\nWinter base, summer base, and precipitation flow submodels\naccount for the remainder.\nResults\nAs of the present time, testing of the SCA snowmeLt submodel\nfor the Kings River hydrologic model has not been completed. The\nresults of preliminary testing and analysis have, however, been\nencouraging. Simulated mean daily runoff for the Kings River\ncomputed as output from the model has been plotted for 1973,\n1974, 1975 and 1976, in Figures 5 through 8. Plots are in conventional units representing actual input and output from the model.\nPlots represent mean daily discharge in cubic feet per second\nagainst time, April 1 through the end of snowmelt. Shown for comparison are the discharges calculated from the model, unimpaired\ndischarges observed, observed air temperature corrected to 2100\nm, observed effective snowline, and calculated elevation of prime.\nCalculation of daily discharges using the SCA snowmelt submodel appears to give results which are entirely acceptable in\nanalysis. In addition, the conceptual model appears to be more\nconsistent with known hydrologic relationships than the formerly\nused snowmelt submodeL. This fact may give assurance in extrapolating the techniques into extreme conditions as well as representing an academically esthetic improvement over the original\nmodel. At this time, no testing has been done on other watersheds, but it is believed that the conceptual model will have a\nhigh degree of transferability.\n\n215\n\nJ\nW\n\n0\n\nC) n cr O\nC9 O ^ Ll- Z\nO2 m o 0\n\n3\n\nI\n\n0\n\n^M\n\n0\n\nsa\no^ oa W\nO J U)\n\n0\xc2\xb0w\nF\n\nOO ti\nco\nQ\n\nv\nUQ\n\nW\n\nW\n\n<O\n\n0\n\nXz\n\n/\n\na<\n\n:E\nCL\n\nQ\n\n(n\n\n1\n\na\n\nI I\t\n\n^^\n\nO\n\nZ\nY\n\ni\n\n^\n\npn\n\nJ\n\n^\n^ i\n\n-IU\nO\n\n_^\n\nW\n\nZ\n\n0\n-\xe2\x80\x94\n\no\nM\n\nJ\n\nN\n\n3\n\n`\t\nw0\n\ny\na\n\nj\n\nW\n_O\n\nr\t\n6\n\nNJ\n\nO\n>\n\n(\n\n0\n^\n\n1\n\nO\n\n0\n\n8\n\nO\t\n\ng\n\nO\n\na\n\n1333 NI NOIIVA3P3\n\n60\t\n\na\'\n\nN\n\n8\t\n\n\xc2\xb0$\n\n00\n\n00\n\nN\t\nN\t\n\nO\t\nN\t\n\nco\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n(0\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nV\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n0\n\n00\t\n\n0\t\n\n$\t\n\n00\n\n00\n\nN\n\nQ\t\n\nco\t\n\nl0\t\n\nIT\n\nN\n\n_\n\nS3O NI 306VHOSIG\t k-IIVCI NV31N\n\n216\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\na\na\n\nJ\nW\n0\nO\t\n\n^U\n\nU 0 W^\nC7 0 (n ^ Z\n\n3\n\n02 m oo\nJm00U)\nLL P\n\nLli\n\n41\n\n0 J N\n\n0\t\n\n}\n\nZO\n\nQa\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nQ U\n\nQ)\n:D\n\nI\n\na\n\nli w ^ ^Q\n\n^\' V)\n\nI\n\n6\n-j\n3:11\n-i\n\nQ L)\n\nJ\n\nO\ncn "\'\nO\nZ_\nY\n\n1\n\nO\n\nI\n\n20\n\nN\n\nr\n\nI\n\n\xc2\xb0a\n\no\n^\n\n2\nO\n\n2\n\n\xe2\x80\x94^\n7\n\n0\nM\n\n/^\n_/\n\nO\n\nNW\nZ\n\n^\n\nO\n)\n\nK^\nm\n\nO\n\nO\nM\n\nO_\n\nO\n\nrn\n\nW\nW\nO\n\nl\n\no\n\nO\n\nN J\n\n\'\n^^\n\na\n\n^^\n\no_a\n\na\n\nw\nJ\nW\n\n\\\n\n0g\n\n8\t\n\n8\n\no\n\n0\t\n\n1333 NI NOIIVA3-13\n\n0\t\n0\t\nN\t\n\n0\t\n0\t\nN\t\n\n0\nQ\t\n\n25\n\nX^\t\n\nm\n\ng\t\n0\t\nT\t\n\no0\t\n\n0\t\nS\t\n\n0\t\n0\t\nN\n\n0\n\nog\n\n0\t\no\t\n\n0\no\n\na0\t\n\n{Op\n\nSAO NI 396VHOSIa\t AIIVO\t NV36N\n\n217\n\n0\t\n\n0\t\nN\n\n0\n\nJ\nW\n0\n\n0\nM\nJ >3\n\nU\t W MO\n\nC9 O\t ^ LL Z\n\nO2m 0 0\n\n3\n0\n\n^^\n\nr 0 ^ pW Q\nO\nw\nX CO\nQ\n0\nJ\n= J z\nU\')\n\n3^\nOO\nF-i a\nc^\n\noa\n-\n\n> 2 QU\n\nCU\n\nOU\n\n0 CL\n^Zgo\n\no\n\ni\n\nO\n\nNJ\n\ni\n\no\n\n0\n\nZ_\nX\n\n0\n\nM\n\nO\n\nN W\nZ\nD\nO\n\n/\n\nO\nM\n\nS\n\na \\^\t\n^o^\n\nm\n\n0\n\n^\n\no\nM\n\n\\\n\nI\n1\n\nYa I\n\n\'^\n\n^^^\n\n0J\n\n_\n\na\noa\n\nr\nI\nO\t\nO\t\nO\t\n\nN\t\n\n6\n0\nO\n\n6\nO\n\nO\t\nO\t\nO\n\nO\t\n\nO\t\nO\t\nO\t\n\nco\n\n1333 NI NOUVA313\nCJ\t\n0\t\nV\t\nN\t\n\nO\t\nO\t\nN\t\nN\t\n\nO\t\nO\t\nO\t\nN\n\nO\nO\n\nT\n\nO\nO\n\n^2\n\nO\t\nO\t\n\nP\t\n\nO\nO\nN\n\nO\t\nO\t\n\nO\t\n\nO\t\nO\t\nco\t\n\nS3O NI 398VH:)SI4 KING NV3W\n\n218\n\nO\nO\nO\n\nO\t\nO\t\n?\n\n6\t\nN\n\nO\n\nJ\nW\n0\n\nO\n\nU\n\nW\n\nX\n\nQ0^\nO2m\t\n\n0\nli Z\nO\n\nJ (no 0\n\n3\no\nJ\n\nU\n\nO QW\nct C)\t\nr\nLL\t\nW 0 U ti\nO Q\nLl\nU\nJ\n\nQ\n< j\nI -/\n\na^?\n\n>^Q\ncr Z\t\n\nU\t\n0\t\n\nO\n\nQ\n\nD\n\n00\nw\n\no\n\nNJ\n\nI\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nI\n\nU\n\nZ_\nY\n\n0\n\nNW\nZ\nO_\nw\n\n/\nO\n\nrn\n\nO\nZ\nO\n\n^\n/\n\na\n\nN\n\nZ\nJ\n\nW\n\nO\n\nNo\n\n\\I\n\nt\\\n\n-\n\n^\n\nJ\nl7\n\nd\n\n\\\t\n^,\t\n\n0\nrn\n\n\xe2\x80\x94^\n\nN\nN\n\n^^\n\nNJ\n\n--\n\n^\xe2\x80\x94\n\n0\t\n0\t\nO\t\n\n0\t\nO\t\n\nO_\t\n\n0\n0\nN\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\no\n\nap\t\n\n0\n0\nO\nID\n\n0\n0\nO\nV\n\n1333 NI NOI1VA3"13\n0\t\n\n0\t\n0\t\t\nR\n\n0\t\n0\t\n0\t\nN\t\n\n0\t\n\n0\t\n0\t\nN\t\n\n0\n\n0\n0\nm\n\n0\t\n\n0\t\n0\t\nb\t\n\n0\t\n\n0\t\n0\t\nV\t\n\n0\t\n0\t\n0\nN\t\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\n0\t\n\xc2\xb0\t\nm\n\nSAO NI 3106VHOSIa ),- 11V0 NV3W\n\n219\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n0\n\n0\t\n\n0\n\n0\t\nN\n\n0\n\na\na\n\nINTERPOLATION AND EXTRAPOLATION OF SCA\nAvailability of Imagery\nThe Landsat imagery is currently available only on a nine-day\ncycle. This poses a problem, since one image set obliterated by\ncloud cover may result in an 18-day period between observations\nthatmake Landsat imagery very difficult to use effectively. In\naddition, delay in receipt of imagery also adversely affects timeliness of data. The more difficult to interpret NOAA imagery is\navailable historically on a daily cycle. Timeliness of satellite\nimagery has already caused difficulty in operational work, making it necessary to interpolate between observations and extrapolate into the future for operational analysis. Results for the\n1977 and 1978 seasonshave shown how misleading images widely\nspaced in time may be. Availability and timeliness of data may\npose a critical problem in operational analysis, even though\ntechniques can be developed to simulate snowmelt runoff through\nhydrologic modeling with satellite observations.\nAs a result of this problem, the possibility was investigated of\ninterpolating and extrapolating results from satellite imagery with\nrespect to time for periods when satisfactory imagery is not\navailable. Modeling techniques are very sensitive to SCA, and\nan error in extrapolating data beyond the "date of forecast"\ntends to create an unstable situation. If the recession of SCA is\nestimated too stow, the model will continue to overestimate runoff until areal extent of snowcover is forcibly corrected.\nDescription of Technique\n\nThe objective of this phase of the investigation was to (1) allow\nfor interpolation of SCA between observations and (2) permit\nextrapolation beyond the last date of satellite observation for the\nperiod of at least two weeks based on intervening temperature,\nprecipitation, snowpack water content and characteristics, and\navailable satellite observations. Results in the Kings River basin\nappeared entirely adequate for interpolation and extrapolation for\nup to two weeks beyond date of last observation during the period\nof melt. Tests suggest that estimates of SCA could be extrapolated even further than two weeks, but undoubtedly accuracy\nwould decline with time. It should be borne in mind, however,\nthat if the primary value of SCA in water supply forecasting or\nhydrologic modeling is to describe unusual or unprecedented conditions, techniques which may be developed to "model" or extrapolate SCA into the future using other parameters may not\n\n220\n\nadequately reflect those unusual conditions.\nData have been collected for the Wind River Range in Wyoming to further test methods for extrapolating SCA. This testing\nis incomplete at the present time, but to date, many similarities\nhave been noted between conditions in the Wind River and in the\nsouthern Sierra Nevada, in spite of the completely different clim\natologic and hydrologic regimes noted in the two areas.\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nFrom a technical standpoint, results of the investigation\nwere entirely acceptable in terms of simulating mean daily discharge and reproducing the snowmelt hydrograph. The ability to\nsimulate rate of snowmelt runoff utilizing areal extent of snowcover from satellite imagery as a parameter in hydrologic\nmodeling was demonstrated. The presence of cloud cover,\nmissing data, delayed data or other problems have made information on snowcover unavailable for operational forecasting for\nconsiderable periods of time even in the southern Sierra which\nis normally reasonably clear during the period of snowmelt.\nThis problem appears to be one of the major operational problems in the use of SCA. Areal extent of snowcover or elevation\nof snow line may be extrapolated with adequate accuracy for\nwater supply forecasting and some hydrologic modeling for extended periods of time.\nApplicability of information on SCA from satellite imagery\nto hydrologic modeling in the Kings River basin was demonstrated, and additional work should be done in this area, not\nonly on the Kings River, but on other watersheds. It is hoped\nthat there is enough Local interest in this work to sponsor operational use of SCA in hydrologic modeling in the southern Sierra\nNevada within the next few years.\n\n221\n\nReferences\n1.
