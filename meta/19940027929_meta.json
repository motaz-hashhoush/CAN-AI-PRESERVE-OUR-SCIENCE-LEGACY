This keyboard splits the standard QWERTY design into two halves and positions each half 90 degrees from the desk. In order to access a computer correctly. 'THE VERTICAL' requires users to position their bodies in optimal alignment with the keyboard. The orthopaedically neutral forearm position (with hands palms-in and thumbs-up) reduces nerve compression in the forearm. The vertically arranged keypad halves ameliorate onset occurrence of keyboard-associated RMI. By utilizing visually-reference mirrored mylar surfaces adjustable to the user's eye, the user is able to readily reference any key indicia (reversed) just as they would on a conventional keyboard. Transverse adjustability substantially reduces cumulative musculoskeletal discomfort in the shoulders. 'THE VERTICAL' eliminates the need for an exterior mouse by offering a convenient finger-accessible curser control while the hands remain in the vertically neutral position. The potential commercial application for 'THE VERTICAL' is enormous since the product can effect every person who uses a computer anywhere in the world. Employers and their insurance carriers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars per year as a result of RMI. This keyboard will reduce the risk.", "title": "THE VERTICAL", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:14:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940027929, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Albert, Stephen L."}, "organization": {"name": "Ergonomic-Interface Keyboard Systems, Inc.", "location": "La Jolla, CA, United States"}}, "id": "46f5526700644dd186112b92aa97f536"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940027929, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Spencer, Jeffrey B."}, "organization": {"name": "Ergonomic-Interface Keyboard Systems, Inc.", "location": "La Jolla, CA, United States"}}, "id": "b479c32e2b2140fb8a7a30c75367b31b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940027929, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940027929, "id": "623bcbbcf72b48fcb7c47d05d9a1c585", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Technology 2003: The Fourth National Technology Transfer Conference and Exposition, Volume 2", "publicationDate": "1994-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940026600, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Tectonic History of the Terrestrial Planets", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940027929.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940027929/downloads/19940027929.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940027929/downloads/19940027929.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940027929/downloads/19940027929.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
