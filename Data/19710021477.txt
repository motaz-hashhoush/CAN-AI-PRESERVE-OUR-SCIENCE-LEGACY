The dominant aspect of the first landing was, simply, that it was done.\nThe second landing was notable for the precision that brought a manned spacecraft to rest 183 m from its target site, a robot spacecraft dispatched to the Moon\ntwo and a half years before. But the outstanding characteristic of the third landing,\nwhen Antares came down to the rolling foothills of Fra Mauro, was the exceptionally rich harvest in lunar science that the mission achieved.\nAt Fra Mauro, astronauts Shepard and Mitchell emplaced an automatic geophysical station that quickly began to work in harness with Station 12, already\nfunctioning 18 1 km to the west, forming a valuable network that permits simultaneous observation from physically separated instruments. They also made a traverse\non foot of record extent in an area of extreme geologic interest and brought back\nto Earth data and core tubes and other geologic samples in unprecedented volume.\nThe preliminary scientific results reported in this publication are the product of\nwork performed in the months immediately following the mission. Unquestionably\nthese analyses and interpretations will be expanded and refined during the months\nand years to come.\nGEORGE Low\nM.\nDeputy Administrator\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nJUNE 1, 1971\n\nV\n\nGon fents\nPAGE\n\nINTRODUCTION\nJames A .

With the understanding of the lunar environment\nachieved by Apollo 11 and the pinpoint-landing capability demonstrated by Apollo\n12, the Apollo 14 landing could be planned for a much rougher area of the Moon\nand one of prime scientific interest. This mission to the Fra Mauro Formation\nprovided geophysical data from a new set of instruments located at latitude\n3\'40\' S, longitude 17\'27\' W. The Apollo 12 lunar-surface experiments package\ndeployed in November 1969 is still functioning at latitude 3\'11\' S, longitude\n23\'23\' W, in the Ocean of Storms approximately 180 km from the Apollo 14\nlanding site. Comparisons between data from these first two sites in the Apollo\nscientific network can now be made. As an example, a single known seismic event,\nsuch as the impact of the lunar module ascent stage on the surface of the Moon,\nresulted in positive indications at both sites.\nThe topography in the landing area was extremely interesting, and the\ngeological and geochemical returns were great. Because of improved equipment,\nsuch as the modularized equipment transporter, and because of the extended time\nspent on the lunar surface, a large quantity and variety of lunar samples were\nreturned to Earth for detailed examination. New information concerning the\nmechanics of the lunar soil was also obtained during this mission. In addition,\nfive lunar-orbital experiments were conducted during the Apollo 14 mission,\nneeding no new equipment other than a camera. The experiments were executed\nby the command module pilot in the command and service module while the\ncommander and the lunar module pilot were on the surface of the Moon.\nThis report is preliminary in nature; however, it is meant to acquaint the\nreader with the actual conduct of the Apollo 14 scientific mission and to record\nthe facts as they appear in the early stages of the scientific mission evaluation. As\nfar as possible, data trends are reported, and preliminary results and conclusions\nare included.\nLarge numbers of samples and quantities of data must yet be examined and\nthe results compared with the scientific information resulting from the Apollo 11\nand 12 missions before any final conclusions can be drawn.\n\nJAMES MCDIVITT\nA.\nNASA Manned Spacecraft Center\n\nx\ni\n\nMission Descripfion\nF.

The impact was detected by the Apollo 12 passive seismic experiment and the seismic signal lasted approximately\n3 hr.\nTwo midcourse corrections were performed to\nplace the spacecraft in the planned trajectory for\nlunar orbit insertion. The spacecraft clock was\nupdated at 04:02 G.m.t., February 3, to compensate for the launch delay and, therefore, aline it\nwith the flight plan. The spacecraft was inserted\ninto an elliptical lunar orbit at 07:OO G.m.t.,\nFebruary 4. The descent-orbit-insertion firing,\nusing the service propulsion system (SPS) , placed\nthe spacecraft in a 58.8- by 9.6-11. mi. lunar orbit.\nThis was the first time the SPS was used for this\npurpose. During prelanding checkout and lunar\ndescent, problems were encountered with the\nguidance abort switch and the landing radar, but\ncoordination between ground-support personnel\nand the crew overcame the difficulties. Before the\nLM landing, the CSM orbit was circularized to\napproximately 60 n. mi. The touchdown occurred\nat 08:37:10 G.m.t., February 5, within 50 m\n(160 ft) of the target point in the Fra Mauro\nhighlands at latitude 3"40\'24/\' S, longitude\n17\'27\'55" W.\nThe first of the two planned periods of extravehicular activity (EVA) began 5 hr 23 min after\ntouchdown. This EVA began 40 min later than\nplanned because of a problem in configuring the\nLM communications system to work with the\ncommunications system in the CDR\'s portable\nlife-support system. A color television camera\nmounted on the descent stage provided live cov-\n\nThe Apollo 14 mission successfully landed the\nthird exploration team on the lunar surface. An\nobjective of the mission was to continue the detailed, systematic scientific investigation of the\nMoon begun on the Apollo 11 and 12 missions.\nThe space vehicle with the crew of Alan B.\nShepard, commander (CDR) ; Stuart A. Roosa,\ncommand module pilot; and Edgar D. Mitchell,\nlunar module pilot, was launched from NASA\nKennedy Space Center, Fla., at 4:03:02 p.m.\ne.s.t. (21:03:02 G.m.t.) on January 31, 1971.\nThe launch was 40 min 3 sec later than planned\nbecause of adverse weather in the launch area.\nThe vehicle was inserted into an Earth parking\norbit of 98.9 by 102 n. mi. 11 min 49 sec after\nliftoff. Earth-orbital checkout and subsequent\ntranslunar injection were accomplished with no\ndifficulty. The planned translunar injection firing\nwas retargeted because of the later liftoff time to\npermit performance of planned lunar activities in\naccordance with established timelines, targeting,\nand Sun angles. A problem was encountered when\nattempting to dock the command and service\nmodule (CSM) with the lunar module (LM) in\nthe SIVB stage. After five unsuccessful docking\nattempts, hard dock was accomplished on the\nsixth attempt 4 hr 57 min after launch. A\nthorough inspection of the docking mechanism\nwas conducted and the mission continued as\nplanned. The docking probe was returned to\nEarth for further analysis.\nAfter LM extraction, the SIVB was targeted to\nimpact the lunar surface. The SIVB impacted the\nlunar surface at 07:40 G.m.t., February 4. Impact occurred 287 km southeast of the planned\nNASA Manned Spacecraft Center.\n\nxiii\n\nerage of the descent of both astronauts to the\nlunar surface. The crew deployed the U.S. flag\nand the solar-wind composition experiment,\nerected the S-band antenna, and off-loaded\nthe modularized equipment transporter (MET),\nthe laser ranging retroreflector (LRRR) , and\nthe Apollo lunar-surface experiments package\n(ALSEP) . The ALSEP was deployed 180 m west\nof the LM, after some difficulty in locating a level\nsite. (The terrain was more undulatory than expected.) The LRRR was deployed an additional\n30 m west of the ALSEP. The MET was used to\ncarry the required equipment and geological\nsamples collected during the 4-hr 49-min EVA,\nwhich included a 30-min extension of planned\nsurface time.\nThe second EVA was a planned extended geological traverse to Cone Crater. At the crew\xe2\x80\x99s\nrequest, the EVA was begun 2 hr 27 min earlier\nthan planned. All equipment required for the\ngeological traverse, including the lunar portable\nmagnetometer (LPM), was loaded on the MET.\nThe traverse up the side of Cone Crater provided\nexperience in climbing and working in hilly terrain in 1/6g conditions. More time was required\nfor the uphill climb than anticipated, but the\ndownslope return was accomplished relatively\nquickly. The samples collected and the area\ntraversed during the EVA were documented with\na 70-mm Hasselblad camera using black-andwhite film and the lunar-surface closeup stereo\ncamera using color film. Two LPM measurements\nf\nwere made. At the end o the EVA, the crew returned to the ALSEP site and realined the centralstation antenna to improve signal reception. The\nsecond EVA lasted 4 hr 20 min, during which\ntime the astronauts traveled approximately 3 km.\nThe crew reported excellent mobility.\nThe crew stowed its gear and 43 kg of samples\nand performed a preascent checkout of the LM\n\nascent stage. Liftoff occurred at 18:48 G.m.t.,\nFebruary 6, after 33 hr on the lunar surface. A\nsingle-orbit rendezvous was accomplished and\ndocking was achieved without incident at 20:35\nG.m.t. After crew transfer, the LM ascent stage\nwas separated and remotely guided to impact on\nthe lunar surface. Impact occurred at latitude\n3\xe2\x80\x9925\xe2\x80\x99 S , longitude 19\xe2\x80\x9940\xe2\x80\x99 W, at 00:45 G.m.t.,\nFebruary 7, between the Apollo 12 and 14 seismometers. The resulting seismic signal lasted for\n1.5 hr and was recorded by both instruments.\nOrbital-science experiments and science photography were performed in lunar orbit. A downlink bistatic-radar experiment was conducted\nusing both very-high-frequency and S-band signals.\nThe S-band transponder was used to measure the\nCSM lunar orbit. Photography of scientifically\ninteresting surface features was obtained in various lighting and Sun angles. Dim-light photography was conducted of diffused galactic light,\nzodiacal light, and the Earth dark side. Photography was also obtained of the gegenschein region.\nPhotography of the Descartes area was obtained\nwith a 500-mm Hasselblad after the Hycon camera\nbecame inoperative.\nTransearth injection was accomplished using\nthe SPS at 01 :39 G.m.t., February 7. During the\nzero-g transearth coast, the crew conducted\ndemonstrations of electrophoretic separation, heat\nflow and convection, liquid transfer, and composite casting. These demonstrations and a press\nconference were reported with live color television. Only one midcourse correction was required and the entry sequence was normal. The\ncommand module splashed down in the Pacific\nOcean approximately 1 km from the target point\nat 20:24 G.m.t., February 9. The landing coordinates as determined by the onboard computer\nwere latitude 27\xe2\x80\x992\xe2\x80\x9824\xe2\x80\x9d S , longitude 172\xe2\x80\x9941\xe2\x80\x9924\xe2\x80\x9d\nW.\n\nxiv\n\nSummary of Scientific Results\nPhilip K .

The major crater Copernicus lies\n360 km to the north, and the bright ray material\nthat emanates from Copernicus Crater covers\nmuch of the landing-site region. In the immediate\nlanding-site area, an important feature is the\nyoung (Copernican age), very blocky Cone\nCrater, which is approximately 340 m in diameter\nand which penetrates the regolith on the ridge to\nthe east of the landing site. Thus, Cone Crater\nwould provide access to the excavated Fra Mauro\nFormation, despite the general overlying blanket\nof later deposits.\nThe lunar-surface experiments planned for the\nApollo 14 mission differed somewhat from those\nof the Apollo 13 mission. The crew\xe2\x80\x99s traverse\ncapability was improved by the addition of the\nmodularized equipment transporter (MET),\nwhich is a light, hand-drawn cart that enabled the\ncrew to transport tools and samples with greater\nease. Two extravehicular activity (EVA) periods\nwere planned, each of which was to last 4 hr\n15 min. The principal objectives of the first EVA\nwere to collect geological samples (including a\ncontingency sample in case an early abort became necessary) and to deploy the Apollo lunarsurface experiments package (ALSEP) . The second EVA was largely devoted to a geological\nsampling traverse toward Cone Crater, with\nseveral other experiments being conducted along\nthe traverse.\n\nThe planned landing site for the Apollo 13\nmission was in the Fra Mauro region, which is\nan area of prime scientific interest because it contains some of the most clearly exposed geological\nformations that are characteristic of the Fra\nMauro Formation. The Fra Mauro Formation is\nan extensive geological unit that is distributed (in\nan approximately radially symmetric fashion\naround the Mare Imbrium) over much of the near\nside of the Moon. Stratigraphic data indicate that\nthe Fra Mauro Formation is older than the Apollo\n1 1 and 12 mare sites. The Fra Mauro Formation\nis thoug%tto be part of the ejecta blanket that resulted from the excavation of the Imbrium Basin,\nwhich is the largest circular mare on the Moon.\nThe Apollo 13 landing site thus offered an opportunity to sample material that had been shocked\nduring one of the major cataclysmic events in the\ngeological history of the Moon and thereby to\ndetermine the date of the event. Furthermore, because of the size of the Imbrium Basin, it was\nexpected that some of the material had come from\ndeep (tens of kilometers) within the original lunar\ncrust. Thus, a landing at the Fra Mauro Formation, in principle, should offer an opportunity to\nsample the most extensive vertical section available of the primordial Moon.\nAfter the Apollo 13 mission, which failed to\nachieve a lunar landing, the importance of the Fra\nMauro landing site led to a decision to attempt\na landing in the same area during the Apollo 14\nmission. The final landing site was very close to\nthat chosen for the Apollo 13 mission. The site\nwas located in a broad, shallow valley between\n\nThis section summarizes the scientific results\nobtained to date from the Apollo 14 mission. It\nshould be understood, however, that this is a\npreliminary report, and the results and, especially,\n\nNASA Manned Spacecraft Center.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nthe interpretations may change after further data\ncollection and analysis.\nGeology\n\nThe Apollo 14 crew traversed a smooth-terrain\nunit, a Fra Mauro ridge unit, and the ejecta\nblanket of Cone Crater. Descriptions, photography, and samples of the Cone Crater ejecta\nblanket were the major geological objectives of\nthe Apollo 14 lunar-surface activity. It was anticipated that the Cone Crater event had resulted in\nthe penetration of the lunar regolith and excavation of material from the Fra Mauro Formation.\nSamples returned from the Cone Crater ejecta\nblanket and the photography of boulders on the\nejecta blanket indicate that the Fra Mauro Formation is comprised of breccias that contain abundant dark lithic clasts and less-abundant light\nclasts. Clasts of breccias within breccias may represent pre-Imbrian cratering in the Imbrium Basin\nregion.\nThe Apollo 14 landing site is dotted with abundant craters that range in diameter from several\nhundred meters to the limit of resolution of the\nHasselbIad data cameras. Craters between 400 m\nand 1 km in diameter are more numerous and\nmore subdued than craters on the maria; this distribution is consistent with the inferred greater\nage (relative to the maria) of the Fra Mauro\nFormation. Craters along the traverse range from\nthe old and highly subdued craters that form the\nrolling topography in the smooth-terrain unit to\nthe sharp 30-m-diameter crater on the Cone\nCrater ejecta blanket near station C\xe2\x80\x99. Rock fragments greater than 2 to 3 cm in diameter are\nsparse in the immediate vicinity of the lunar\nmodule (LM) landing site, but the surface of the\nCone Crater ejecta blanket is characterized by\nabundant rock fragments that measure up to several meters in diameter.\nThe albedo of the fine-grained material in the\nvicinity of the landing site ranges from 8.2 to 15\npercent, with the lower albedo values typical of\nthe smooth-terrain unit and the higher values\ntypical of the Cone Crater ejecta blanket. The\nhighest albedo values yet measured on the lunar\nsurface are the values determined for the Cone\nCrater ejecta blanket in the vicinity of station C1.\n\nThe albedo of the component parts of the fragmental rocks ranges from 9 to 36 percent.\nSmall-scale surface lineaments, although less\nwell developed than at the Apollo 11 and 12\nlanding sites, are present at the Apollo 14 landing\nsite. Two primary northwest and northeast trends\nand one secondary north trend agree well with\nthe strongest trends observed at the Apollo 11 and\n12 landing sites. The lineaments are less well developed on the Cone Crater ejecta blanket than\non the smooth-terrain unit. Fillets of fine-grained\nmaterial banked against rock fragments are\ncommon at the Apollo 14 landing site. The variety\nof fillet geometries suggests that the Blets are\nprobably formed by several different mechanisms.\nThe large number of boulders (most of which\nwere probably ejected from Cone Crater) offered\nfor the first time the opportunity to study textures\nand structures of lunar rocks at scales from tens of\ncentimeters to a meter. All the boulders appear to\nbe fragmental, with abundant clasts up to 10 cm\nacross or larger. The clastic appearance of the\nrocks is somewhat similar to the appearance of\nejecta deposits of impact origin on Earth. Planar\nfeatures (some of which are systematic in their\ndevelopment) are visible in all the boulders. In\nsome of the boulders, distinct lithologic layers are\nevident. The boulders show different degrees of\nrounding by lunar erosion; differences in shape\nare probably caused in part by internal fracture\nsystems and possibly by differences in lithologies.\nApproximately 43 kg of lunar samples were\nreturned by the Apollo 14 crew, including 33\nrocks that weigh more than 50 g eacl;. Thirteen\nof the rock samples were sufficiently documented\nto determine lunar locations and orientations. The\nlocations of most of the samples have been at least\napproximately determined.\nNearly all the returned samples are fragmental\nrocks. Some rocks are composed mostly of dark\nclasts and a lighter colored matrix; others consist\nof a mixture of light- and medium-gray clasts in a\ndark-gray matrix. Samples of both rock types were\ncollected from widely separated points along the\ntraverse.\nNumerous similarities can be seen between the\ncharacteristics of the returned samples and of the\nboulders shown in the photographs. Closely spaced\nfractures (in some cases, two or more intersecting\n\nSUMMARY OF SCIENTIFIC RESULTS\n\nfracture sets) are present in many of the returned\nrocks. Variations among the rocks suggest the\npossibility of considerable lateral or vertical\nvariation within the Fra Mauro unit.\nReturned Lunar Samples\n\nOf the 43 kg of lunar material returned by the\nApollo 14 crew, the Lunar Sample Preliminary\nExamination Team has examined portions of six\nsoil samples and the surfaces of all rocks that\nweigh 1 g or more-approximately 150 rocks in\nall. Thin sections of 12 rocks were examined;\noptical spectroscopic analyses were performed on\n16 samples; gamma-ray analyses for potassium,\nthorium, uranium, aluminum-26, sodium-22, and\ncobalt-56 were performed on 14 samples; and\nnoble-gas analyses were performed on eight\nsamples.\nThe ratio of fragmental rocks (including breccias and recrystallized clastic rocks) to igneous\nrocks (mostly basaltic) is approximately 9 :1,\nwhich is much higher than the 1:1 and 1:9 ratios\nfor the Apollo 11 and 12 rocks, respectively. The\nfragmental rocks returned from the Apollo 14\nlanding site also have larger and more abundant\nclasts and have a generally much more recrystallized matrix than the breccias from the previous\nmissions. Three classifications of rocks from the\nApollo 14 landing site were made for preliminary\ndescriptive purposes:\n(1) Rocks with predominantly lithic clasts in\nvery friable matrices\n(2) Rocks with predominantly light-colored\nand very abundant clasts in a matrix of moderate\ncoherency\n( 3 ) Rocks with predominantly dark-colored\nclasts in a matrix of moderate to high coherency\nThe larger clasts are commonly clastic rocks themselves, but nonfragmental lithic clasts, which have\nbeen separated into six groups, are present. These\ngroups are ( 1) clinopyroxene-plagioclase, (2)\nfeldspar, ( 3 ) subophitic plagioclase-orthopyroxene, (4) olivine-glass, ( 5 ) granitic olivine, and\n(6) glass. Accessory minerals that are present\ninclude ilmenite, metallic iron, troilite, chromium\nspinel, ulvospinel, metallic copper, armalcolite,\nzircon, apatite, and potassium-feldspar.\nOnly two homogeneous crystalline rocks that\nweigh more than 50 g were found. These rocks\n\n3\n\nare basaltic, have typical igneous textures, and\ncontain plagioclase, pyroxenes, olivine, and possibly opaques. Very-fine-grained granulitic-textured\ncrystalline rocks were also found. Basaltic rock\nsample 14310, which weighs 3.4 kg, was the second largest rock returned. It is similar to terrestrial high-alumina basalts, but contains more\nhighly calcic plagioclase and predominantly\npigeonite pyroxenes. The occurrence of a solar\nflare on January 25, 1971, induced the formation\nof cobalt-56, which has been detected in the upper\nsurface of the rock.\nThe soil samples cbllected at various locations\nvary in composition and grain size; and, within\nparticular samples, a compositional variation\nexists among the grains of differing size. The finer\ngrained portions have a higher glass content than\nthe coarser grained portions. The soil collected\nfrom the immediate vicinity of Cone Crater has\ncoarser grains than the soils from other locations\nand has a lower glass content and a higher content of fragmental-rock fragments. The core\nsamples have thus far been studied only by X-ray\nradiography; however, definite layering and some\ngrading of particle sizes have been observed.\nChemical analyses of the Apollo 14 material\nshow it to be distinct from the material returned\nfrom the Apollo 11 and 12 landing sites in that\nlower concentrations of iron, titanium, manganese, chromium, and scandium and higher\nconcentrations of silicon, aluminum, zirconium,\nrubidium, strontium, sodium, lithium, lanthanum,\nthorium, and uranium are present. The total\ncarbon content of the soil samples falls within the\ncarbon-content range found for material returned\nfrom the Apollo 11 and 12 sites. The rocks have\ncarbon contents that range from 28 to 225 parts\nper million.\nA noticeable difference in the noble-gas content\nof material from the Apollo 14 landing site was\nobserved. The spallation-produced isotopes of\nthese noble gases in four Apollo 14 rocks yielded\nexposure ages of 10 to 20 million yr, which is\nconsiderably lower than the 40- to 500-million-yr\nexposure ages of the rocks returned from previous missions. The solar-wind content of the fragmental rocks varies between the high values seen\nfor the solar-wind content of fine material to\nessentially zero.\n\n4\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nSoil Mechanics\nAlthough the surface texture and appearance of\nthe soil at the Apollo 14 landing site are similar\nto those at the Apollo 1 1 and 12 landing sites, a\nlarger variation in the soil characteristics exists at\ndepths of a few centimeters in both lateral and\nvertical directions than had previously been encountered. The walls of a trench that was dug by\nthe commander collapsed at a shallower depth\nthan had been predicted, evidently because of\nlessened soil cohesion. Calculations indicate that\nthe soil-cohesion value at the Apollo 14 trench\nsite may be as small as 10 percent of the values\ncalculated for soils at previous landing sites. The\ngrain-size distributions of most of the soil samples\nreturned from the Apollo 14 site are similar to\nthe grain-size distributions of soil samples from\nthe Apollo 1 1 and 12 sites, with two significant\nexceptions: (1) a soil sample collected from near\nthe rim of Cone Crater and (2) a soil sample from\nthe bottom of the trench. At both of these locations, the soil was considerably coarse, with the\nmedian grain size as much as 10 times greater\nthan at other Apollo 14 soil-sample locations.\nThe LM pilot was unable to push the Apollo\nsimple penetrometer into the lunar surface near\nthe ALSEP as deeply as had been expected.\nSimilarly, the Apollo 14 crew encountered more\ndifficulty in driving the core tubes than did the\nApollo 12 crew. These results indicate that the\nsoil at the Apollo 14 landing site is stronger with\ndepth than had been previously supposed. The\ncalculated bulk density of the soil in the lower\nhalf of the double core tube was significantly less\nthan that determined for soil in the lower half of\nthe Apollo 12 double core tube. Variations in the\nsoil grain-size distribution or specific gravity (or\nboth) may account for this dif\xe2\x82\xacerence in bulk\ndensity. The MET track observations confirm that\nthe soil is less dense, more compressible, and\nweaker at the rims of small craters than in level\nintercrater regions.\n\nPassive Seismic Experiment\n\nEach lunar-landing mission to date has included\ndeployment o a passive seismometer. The Apollo\nf\n\n1 1 instrument produced useful data for approximately 1 month; however, the Apollo 12 instrument is still functioning satisfactorily. Deployment\nof the Apollo 14 passive seismometer as a part of\nthe ALSEP thus represented a major step forward\nin the location and interpretation of lunar seismic\nevents by providing a second instrument, one\nseparated from the Apollo 12 passive seismometer\nby a baseline of 181 km.\nThe Apollo 14 seismometer has detected natural\nseismic events at more than twice the frequency\nrecorded by the Apollo 12 instrument, and all\nseismic events that have been recorded at the\nApollo 12 site have also been detected by the\nApollo 14 instrument. It is hypothesized that the\ngreater sensitivity at the Apollo 14 site is a result\nof the thick layer of unconsolidated material that\nblankets this region (the Fra Mauro Formation\nand the overlying regolith). This layer of unconsolidated material may provide a more efficient\ncoupling of seismic energy with the lunar surface.\nThe Apollo 14 instrument appears to be sufficiently sensitive to detect the impacts at any\nlocation on the Moon of meteoroids that have\nmasses in excess of approximately 1 kg.\nThe detected natural events can be divided into\ntwo classes (on the basis of spectral characteristics\nand other characteristics of the signals) that correspond to meteoroid impacts and moonquakes.\nMoonquake occurrences correlate strongly with\nthe time of perigee passage of the Moon in its\norbit, which leads to the hypothesis that the release of internal strain, the origin of which is\nunknown, is triggered by tidal stresses. It is believed that not less than nine different locations\nare involved in the moonquakes that have been\ndetected by both seismometers, although more\nthan 80 percent of the total seismic energy detected has come from a single focal zone that is\nlocated perhaps 600 to 700 km from both stations\nand possibly at a considerable depth within the\nMoon. If the depth of the focal zone is confirmed\nby future data, fundamentally important information about the present state of the lunar interior\nwill be made available.\nA cumulative mass spectrum for meteoroids\nimpacting the Moon has been tentatively constructed from the data. The cumulative mass spec-\n\nSUMMARY OF SCIENTIFIC RESULTS\n\ntrum indicates that the total meteoroid mass flux\nis a factor of 20 less than values from previous\nestimates. Approximately one meteoroid impact\nper year of kinetic energy equal to that of the\nSIVB impact is predicted. The Apollo 14 SIVB\nimpact was detected by the Apollo 12 passive\nseismometer, and the LM ascent-stage impact was\ndetected at both sites. These seismic events produced the characteristic, remarkably slow decay\nsignals that had been previously detected by the\nApollo 12 instrument; the signals persisted for\nseveral hours. The passive seismometer data have\ngreatly increased the understanding of the lunar\nstructure and of seismic energy transmission. A\nsimple wave-propagation model of the entire\nMoon has now been derived; the model involves\nintensive scattering of waves in the outer shell of\nthe Moon but very low energy absorption.\nCrew activities produced detectable seismic\nsignals for the Apollo 14 instrument throughout\nthe EVA traverses. Venting gases from and\nthermoelastic stress relief within the LM caused\nthe expected seismic signals, which are continuing.\nIn view of the long-range detectability of lunar\nseismic events, it appears that a scattered network\nof passive seismometers can produce very valuable\ndata. The deployment of a third passive seismometer at the Apollo 15 landing site will greatly\nincrease the capability for accurately locating\nnatural events that occur on the Moon.\n\n5\n\nfrom geological studies of small craters. The seismic propagation velocity observed during the\nthumping. operation is in remarkable agreement\nwith the propagation velocity derived at the Apollo\n12 landing site (108 m/sec), where the elapsed\ntime between LM ascent-engine ignition and\narrival of the generated seismic signal at the\nApollo 12 passive seismometer was recorded.\nBelow the regolith at the Apollo 14 landing\nsite is another layer, which exhibits a P-wave\nvelocity of 299 m/sec. The thickness of this layer\nis estimated to be approximately 50 m. It is premature to speculate on the composition of this\nlayer, but it is interesting to note that the estimated\nthickness of the layer is not in substantial disagreement with estimates of the thickness of the Fra\nMauro Formation in this area. The relatively low\ncompressional-wave velocities that have been\nmeasured in this experiment are evidence against\nthe existence of substantial permafrost near the\nsurface in the landing region.\nThe ASE also includes a rocket-grenade\nlauncher that is capable of launching four grenades\nto impact at known times and at known distances\n(up to approximately 1500 m) from the seismometer. The rocket grenades will not be activated\nuntil data collection from the other ALSEP experiments is virtually complete.\n\nActive Seismic Experiment\n\nSuprathermal Ion Detector Experiment\n(Lunar Ionosphere Detector)\n\nFor the first time in the Apollo lunar-landing\nprogram, an active seismic experiment (ASE) , in\naddition to the passive seismometer, was deployed\non the lunar surface. The Apollo 14 crew deployed a string of three geophones across the lunar\nsurface and used a thumper device with small\nexplosive initiators to generate seismic signals.\nThe active seismic instrument can also be used to\nmonitor high-frequency natural seismic activity.\nThe data that were generated by the thumping\noperation indicate the existence of a surficial\nlayer approximately 8.5 m thick at the ALSEP\nsite. This layer, which exhibits a P-wave velocity\nof 104 m/sec, may be interpreted as the regolith\nin this area. The 8.5-m thickness of the regolith is\nin good agreement with the thickness estimated\n\nThe suprathermal ion detector experiment\n(SIDE), which was deployed as part of the\nApollo 14 ALSEP, is essentially identical to the\ninstrument deployed by the Apollo 12 crew. By\ncorrelation of data returned by the two SIDE instruments now operating on the Moon, discrimhation is possible between moving ion clouds and\ntemporal fluctuations of the overall ion distribution. For example, this discrimination capability\nenabled the interpretation of an ion event that was\ndetected at both SIDE sites on March 19. This ion\nevent was the passage of a large (approximately\n130 km in diameter) ion cloud that moved westward at approximately 0.7 km/sec. The cloud\nwas possibly associated with a relatively large\n\n6\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nseismic event that was recorded by the Apollo 14\npassive seismometer approximately 37 min earlier.\nIons in the 250- to 1000-eV energy range have\nbeen detected streaming down the magnetosheath\nof the Earth as the Moon entered the magnetospheric tail. In addition, approximately 2 days\nafter sunrise, intermittent intense fluxes of 50- to\n70-eV ions with masses in the 17- to 24-amu/unitcharge range were recorded. Energy and mass\nspectra were obtained during the venting of the\noxygen atmosphere of the the LM cabin. After\nascent-stage liftoff, the Apollo 14 LM ascentengine exhaust was detected by the Apollo 12\nSIDE, beginning 1 min after the vehicle passed\nthe Apollo 12 landing site at a minimum slant\nrange of 27 km. The Apollo 14 SIVB and LM\nascent-stage impacts both produced useful signals\nat the Apollo 12 SIDE.\nCold-Cathode-Gage Experiment\n(Lunar Atmosphere Detector)\n\nThe cold-cathode-gage experiment, which is\nsimilar to the instrument deployed as a part of the\nApollo 12 ALSEP, measures the concentration of\nneutral atoms (ie., the density of the lunar atmosphere) in the vicinity of the ALSEP. During the\nlunai night, the concentration appears to be apalthough transient inproximately 2 X lo5 ~ m - ~ ,\ncreases by one to two orders of magnitude are\nfairly frequent and last from minutes to many\nhours. Some of these transient increases may be\ncaused by venting or outgassing from the LM or\nfrom other equipment at the ALSEP site. As\nmight be expected, the neutral-atom concentration\nrises rapidly at sunrise (two orders of magnitude\nin 2 min) ; the concentration then decays, over a\nperiod of approximately 50 hr, to a mean daytime\n~.\nlevel of less than 10\' ~ m - Numerous gas events\nhave also been observed during the lunar day. The\nmean neutral-atom levels observed are thought\nstill to be affected by outgassing from other\nALSEP equipment, but the output of neutral\natoms from this source should decrease with time\nin an identifiable way.\nCharged-Particle Lunar Environment\nExperiment\n\nThe charged-particle lunar environment experi-\n\nment (CPLEE) is designed to measure the ambient fluxes of charged particles, both electrons\nand ions, with energies in the range of 50 to\n50 000 eV. One of the most stable features observed is the presence of low-energy electrons\nwhenever the landing site is illuminated by the\nSun. The variation in the low-energy-electron flux\nduring the lunar eclipse of February 10 provided\nstrong evidence that the electrons are photoelectrons liberated from the lunar surface. The\nsolar-wind flux observed by the CPLEE has\nexhibited rapid time variations (periods of approximately 10 sec), both when the Moon is\nin interplanetary space and when it is immersed\nin the magnetospheric tail of the Earth. Passage\nof the Moon through the magnetopause and magnetospheric tail has produced some particularly\ninteresting data, including rapidly fluctuating lowenergy (50- to 200-eV) electrons, fluxes of\nmedium-energy electrons lasting from a few\nminutes to tens of minutes, and electrons that have\nenergy spectra remarkably similar to those observed above terrestrial auroras. Thus, auroral\nparticles do appear to penetrate far into the magnetospheric tail, an observation that, if confirmed,\ncontains important implications concerning the\ngeneral topology of the magnetosphere.\nAfter the Apollo 14 LM ascent-stage impact,\ntwo plasma clouds, which were separated in time\nby a few seconds, passed the CPLEE. If these\nplasma clouds were associated with the impact,\nthey were traveling at approximately 1 km/sec\nand had diameters of 14 and 7 km.\nLaser Ranging Retroreflector\n\nUsed in conjunction with the laser ranging retroreflector (LRRR) deployed during the Apollo 11\nmission, the Apollo 14 LRRR array provides a\ncapability for accurate monitoring of lunar librations in longitude. The LRRR scheduled for deployment during the Apollo 15 mission will\ncomplete the network by providing a long baseline\nseparation of LRRR arrays in latitude as well.\nThe deployment of a complete network is important not only because study of the lunar librations\nprovides information about the internal structure\nof the Moon, but also because knowledge of lunar\nlibrations enables the errors that are introduced\n\nSUMMARY OF SCIENTIFIC RESULTS\n\nby them to be eliminated when range measurements are needed in other studies (such as geophysics, general relativity, etc.) .\nRange measurements to the Apollo 14 LRRR\nwere successfully accomplished on the day it was\ndeployed by the crew. Range measurements taken\nafter the LM liftoff indicate that the ascent-stageengine bum caused no serious degradation of the\nLRRR reflective properties. Continued measurements over a period of years will be required\nbefore the full scientific value of this program is\nrealized. Results to date indicate that the LRRRarray lifetime on the Moon will be long enough\nfor all scientific objectives to be fulfilled.\nSolar-Wind Composition Experiment\n\nThe solar-wind composition experiment was\nsimilar to the investigations conducted during the\nApollo 11 and 12 missions. The aluminum foil\nwas exposed to the solar wind at the Apollo 14\nsite for 21 hr. Five small samples from the upper\npart of the foil have been analyzed to date to\ndetermine noble-gas concentrations. The helium-4\nflux observed is definitely lower than the flux\ndetected during previous missions, but the\nhelium-4/helium-3 ratio is similar to that obtained\nduring the Apollo 12 mission and higher than that\nobtained during the Apollo 11 mission. Several\nisotopes of neon were detected, and their concentrations were measured. For the first time, the\npresence of argon in the solar wind has been detected. The accuracy of the isotopic ratios for\nargon will be improved when larger pieces of foil\nhave been examined.\nLunar Portable Magnetometer\n\nThe Apollo 12 ALSEP included a magnetometer that measured the unexpectedly intense,\nsteady magnetic field of 38 gammas at the ALSEP\nsite. The Apollo 14 ALSEP does not include a\nstationary magnetometer; instead, a new instrument, the lunar portable magnetometer (LPM) ,\nwas used during the second EVA to measure the\nmagnetic field at two locations separated by 1.1\nkm. These measurements yielded values of 103\nand 43 gammas, which indicated that the magnetic\nanomaly at the Apollo 12 landing site ( 181 km\n\n7\n\naway) is by no means unique on the Moon. These\nresults, together with the relatively high magnetic\nremanence found in returned lunar samples from\nall landing sites to date, give evidence that much\nof the lunar-surface material has been magnetized\n-perhaps even the entire crustal shell around\nthe Moon. The LPM measurements enable a\nmagnetic-field gradient of 54 gammas/km to be\ncalculated, which is less than the upper limit of\n133 gammas/km that was determined from measurements with the Apollo 12 magnetometer.\nS-Band Transponder Experiment\n\nThe S-band transponder experiment used precision doppler tracking of the command and\nservice module and the LM to provide detailed\ninformation about the near-side lunar gravity field.\nThis technique was used with the Lunar Orbiter\nspacecraft and resulted in the discovery of the\nlarge gravity anomalies called mascons. The\nApollo tracking system is capable of measuring\nline-of-sight velocity with a resolution of 0.65\nm/sec.\nReduction of the data obtained during the\nApollo 14 mission is in progress. Preliminary results show that the gravity-anomaly profile over\nthe mascon in Mare Nectaris has a flat-topped\nappearance that is characteristic of a shallow plateshaped mass anomaly. If other mascons exhibit\nthis characteristic, it will be evidence that the\nmascons are near-surface features rather than\ndeeply buried inhomogeneities. Results of the\nanalysis of the crash orbit of the Apollo 14 LM\nascent stage will be particularly interesting. Data\nwere obtained at very low altitudes, which may\nenable small anomalies ( a few kilometers in\ndiameter) to be discerned.\nAncillary Experiments\n\nIn addition tc the preceding experiments, several less formal investigations were conducted\nduring the Apollo 14 mission. The details of\nthese investigations will be published elsewhere.\nThe first such investigation concerned the light\nflashes that all crews since Apollo 11 have observed, when in the dark or when they closed their\neyes, while in transit to and from the Moon and\nin lunar orbit. The Apollo 14 crew was briefed on\n\n8\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nthis phenomenon before the mission, and an\nobservational schedule was suggested that was\nintended to test the various theories of the origin\nof the flashes. The most significant result obtained\nduring the flight was the discovery that it is not\nnecessary to be dark adapted to see the flashes.\nThis observation indicates that Cerenkov radiation from energetic cosmic rays traversing the eyeball, which had been the most widely accepted\nexplanation for the light flashes, probably does\nnot cause all or most of the flashes because the\nlight from this source is quite faint. Comparison\nwith results of recent terrestrial experiments (in\nwhich human subjects were exposed to particle\nbeams from accelerators) suggests that some of\nthe flashes observed in space may be caused by\ndirect ionization interactions of cosmic rays\nwithin the retina.\nDuring transearth coast, the crew conducted a\nseries of simple demonstrations with the objective\nof gathering design data for use in future scientific and engineering applications. These demonstrations were shown on television and were\nfilmed, and samples were returned to Earth for\nanalyses, which are presently in progress. The\nresdts to date are as follows.\n\nthat more homogeneous mixing was achieved than\nis possible with similar samples on Earth. Further\nresearch in this area may result in the manufacture\nof new combinations of materials in the space\nenvironment (such as immiscible composites and\nsupersaturated alloys) for structural, electronic,\nand other applications.\n\nComposife Casting\n\nLiquid Transfer\n\nEleven samples of various immiscible compositions were heated, mixed by shaking, and allowed to solidify by cooling in zero gravity.\nLaboratory analysis has not yet been completed,\nbut X-ray examination of the samples indicates\n\nThe liquid-transfer demonstration clearly\nshowed that suitable baffles inside a tank in zero\ngravity permit positive expulsion of liquid contents, taking advantage of the surface-tension\nproperties of the liquid.\n\nElecfrophorefic Separation\n\nResults to date indicate that electrophoresis\n(which is a technique commonly used on Earth\nfor analysis or separation of chemical, especially\norganic, mixtures) provides a sharper separation\nin zero gravity because of a reduction of sedimentation and thermal convective mixing. This process\nmay allow economical purification and separation\nof high-value biological materials in space.\nHeat Flow and Convection\n\nIt was demonstrated that surface tension can\nproduce Btnard cells in a liquid, independently\nof gravity-induced convection. Zone heating of\nliquid samples produced an unexpected cyclic\nheat-flow pattern that is now under study.\n\n7. Photographic Summary\nJohn W . Dietrich a\n\nHasselblad camera to document the appearance.\nDuring the translunar-coast period, the crescent\nMoon and distant Earth were photographed. At a\npoint near the Moon, the cloud of drops formed\nby waste water dumped from the CSM was photographed from a vantage point within the LM.\nAfter lunar-orbit insertion, visual observations\nof the lunar surface and operational tasks occupied\nmost of the first orbit. The data acquisition\ncamera (DAC) was mounted on the sextant to\nrecord landmarks tracked during revolution 2.\nNear the beginning of the third revolutim, the\nengine was fired for descent-orbit insertion.\nThe LTC was readied for the first of several\nscheduled passes over the candidate landing site\nnear Descartes Crater. As the spacecraft approached Theophilus Crater during revolution 4,\nthe camera was actuated to expose approximately\n1 frame/sec as the spacecraft descended to less\nthan 10 n. mi. above the terrain east of the candidate landing site. The command module pilot\n(CMP) reported an unusual noise-intermittent\nat first, then continuous-during the period of\ncamera operation. Ground-support personnel immediately began to assess possible causes of the\nproblem to determine the effect on remaining\nLTC tasks. An eating and rest period provided\nsufficient time for ground-support personnel to\nassess the problem before the next scheduled\nperiod of camera operation.\nIntense preparation for undocking and separation of the LM precluded the scheduling of LM or\nCSM photographic tasks for two revolutions after\nthe rest period. Undocking and separation were\nrecorded by 70- and 16-mm cameras on both\nspacecraft. The CMP tracked a landmark after\nseparation for the only test of the CSM lowaltitude landmark tracking during this mission. A\n\nThe photographic objectives of the Apollo 14\nmission were designed to support orbital and surface science, to provide data for evaluating potential sites for future lunar landings, and to\ndocument the operating characteristics of equipment in orbit and on the surface. The photographic\ntasks were integrated with other mission objectives\nto achieve a maximum return of data from the\nlunar voyage.\nThe Apollo 14 crew returned 1328 frames of\n70-mm photography and 15 exposed magazines of\n16-mm film. In an attempt to recover usable\nphotographs from the two rolls of 5-in. film exposed in the lunar topographic camera (LTC)\nthat malfunctioned, an extensive developmental\nanalytic plan was instituted. The extended period\nof careful and dficult processing, coupled with\nconcurrent research, resulted in the recovery of\n193 usable photographs. Al photography has been\nl\nscreened and indexed; but, when this report was\nprepared, only the photographs in and near the\nbootstrap site had been analyzed in detail.\nThe earliest planned photographic tasks for the\nApollo 14 mission were scheduled to document\nthe transposition and docking maneuvers approximately 3 hr after launch. The delay in obtaining a\nhard dock placed the mission behind in the time\nline, and photographic documentation of the repeated docking attempts increased film consumption. After withdrawal of the lunar module (LM) ,\nthe SIVB stage was photographed with both 16and 70-mm cameras as the range between the\ncommand and service module (CSM) and SIVB\nstage increased. The docking probe was brought\ninto the spacecraft after docking. Although the\nprobe appeared to be normal in every way and\noperated normally, it was photographed with a\na\n\nNASA Manned Spacecraft Center.\n\n9\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n10\n\nservice propulsion system burn near the end of\nrevolution 12 placed the CSM in a near-circular\norbit.\n\nthe Moon shielded the CSM from both sunlight\nand earthshine to support studies of the gegenschein and other dim-light phenomena.\n\nWhile the CSM and the LM operated separately, the CMP followed a busy schedule. The\nexperimental tasks included photographic assignments covering a wide range of targets and requiring varied camera-lens-film combinations, as listed\nin table 1-1. Most of the targets were on the lunar\nsurface but some, such as the LM during separation and docking, were at close range. Targets far\nout in space were photographed at times when\n\nThe CMP photographed selected orbital-science\ntargets on the far side and on the eastern half of\nthe visible hemisphere during revolution 14 as the\nLM crew made preparations for landing. Plans for\nphotographing the powered-descent-initiation burn\nand touchdown of the LM were canceled because\nof the earlier malfunction of the LTC.\nLandmark-tracking data, recorded with the\n16-mm DAC mounted on the sextant, supported\n\nTABLE Photographic Equipment Used in Command Module (CM)\n1-1.\nFilm size and type\n\nRemarks\n\nElectric; interchangeable\nlenses of 80-, 250-, and\n500-mm focal length\n\n70-mm; SO-368 Ektachrome\nMS color-reversal film, ASA\n64; 3400 Panatomic-X blackand-white film, ASA 80; SO349 high-definition aerial\nfilm, AEI 6\n\nUsed with 500-mm lens to provide convergent stereoscopic\ncoverage over candidate landing sites near Descartes Crater;\nused with appropriate lens for\nCSM orbital sciences\n\nHasselblad DC.. . . . .\n\nElectric, Reseau plate,\n80-mm lens\n\n70-mm; 3400 Panatomic-X\nblack-and-white film, ASA\n80; SO-349 high-definition\naerial film, AEI 6; 2485\nblack-and-white film, ASA\n6000\n\nUsed for stereoscopic strip photographs of potential landing\nsite and CSM orbital-science\nphotographic targets\n\nLunar topographic\ncamera\n\n18-in. lens, vacuum platen,\nimage-motion compensation.\n\n5-in. ; type SO-349 high-definition aerial film, AEI 6;\n3400 Panatomic-X blackand-white film, ASA 80.\n\nUsed to obtain high-resolution\nphotography of lunar surface\nnear candidate Descartes\nCrater landing site; operating\ndifficulties prevented scheduled\nconvergent stereoscopic photography of the approach to\nthe Descartes Crater site, of\nthe landed LM near Fra Mauro\nCrater, and of the impact\npoints of the Apollo 14 SIVB\nstage and LM\n\nDAS .... . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nInterchangeable lenses of\nlo-, 18-, and 75-mm\nfocal length ; variable\nframe rates of 1, 6, 12,\nand 24 frames /set\n\n16-mm; SO-368 Ektachrome\nMS color-reversal film, ASA\n64; SO-168 Ektachrome E F\ncolor-reversal film exposed\nand developed at ASA 1000;\n2485 black-and-white film,\nASA 6000\n\nBracket mounted in CSM rendezvous window to record\nview during transposition and\ndocking, LM ejection, LM undocking, rendezvous and docking, and LM jettison; hand\nheld or bracket mounted for\ngeneral photography and\nexperiment records within\nCSM\n\nFeaiures\n\nCamera\n\nHasselblad EL.\n\n. ... .\n\nPHOTOGRAPHIC SUMMARY\n\nboth operational and scientific objectives. The\nCMP was occupied with landmark tracking during\na large part of the sunlit segments of revolutions\n13, 15, 18, and 29. Photography supporting\nstudies of the gegenschein and dim-light phenomena occupied appropriate parts of the night\nsegments of revolutions 15, 16, 18, 19, and 26.\nLong strips of overlapping zero-phase photographs were obtained during revolutions 16 and\n30. The camera was pointed backward toward the\nzero-phase point after the CSM crossed the farside terminator. On approaching the near-side\nterminator during revolution 16, the spacecraft\nwas rotated to point the camera forward toward\nthe zero-phase point.\nDuring revolution 25 , several orbital-science\ntargets were photographed with a Hasselblad EL\n(electric) camera equipped with a 250-mm lens,\nwhile the CSM operated under constraints imposed by the bistatic-radar experiment. During\nrevolution 26, the Hasselblad DC (data) camera\nwas used to take a continuous strip of overlapping\nvertical photographs from a point near the far-side\nterminator across the bootstrap site near Descartes\nCrater, to a point southwest of Lansberg Crater.\nAn area north of Descartes Crater, a candidate\nbootstrap site for the Apollo 16 landing, was a\nphotographic target of highest priority during this\nmission. The LTC coverage was designed to support the detailed evaluation of lunar-surface characteristics near possible landing points within the\narea. Noisy operation of the LTC on the first of\nthree scheduled photographic passes indicated a\ncamera malfunction. A contingency procedure for\nobtaining site-evaluation photography using a\nHasselblad EL camera equipped with a 500-mm\nlens was activated. With a spacecraft maneuver\nproviding the required image-motion compensation, convergent stereoscopic coverage of more\nthan 100 km\' in the target area was obtained during each pass. The contingency procedure was\nsubstituted for strips of vertical LTC photographs\nscheduled for revolution 27 and oblique LTC photographs scheduled for revolution 28. A third\nopportunity was scheduled during revolution 30\n\n11\n\nto increase the probability of success. During revolutions 27 and 28, the spacecraft was maneuvered\nabout the prime target point. The ground-support\npersonnel observing telemetry data and the CMP\nreported that the operations appeared smooth and\nsatisfactory. The third maneuver, during revolution\n30, was therefore targeted to the east of the prime\npoint to increase the area covered by convergent\nphotography. Additional orbital-science photography was taken with the Hasselblad EL and DC\ncameras during revolutions 28, 29, and 30 when\nthe spacecraft orientation was not constrained by\nthe bootstrap photography.\nShortly after the LM-CSM separation during\nrevolution 12, the LM crew photographed the\nCSM above a lunar-surface scene illuminated by\na high Sun. After photographing the crescent\nEarth rising above the lunar horizon during revolution 13, the LM crew continued preparations\nfor the lunar landing. The bracket-mounted\n16-mm DAC recorded the spectacular scene visible through the right-hand window of the LM\nfrom the time of pitchover to the landing at the\nFra Mauro site 4 min later. The cameras used in\nthe LM and on the lunar surface are listed in\ntable 1-11.\nThe 33.5-hr stay on the lunar surface accommodated two extravehicular activity (EVA) periods\nfor a total lunar-surface stay time in excess of\n17 man-hr. Photography supporting the lunarsurface activities was designed to document\nthe emplacement of experiments comprising\nthe Apollo lunar-surface experiments package\n(ALSEP) , to augment crew observations, to expand geologic descriptions during the extended\ntraverse toward Cone Crater, and to record the\neffects of the dynamic interaction between Apollo\nequipment and the lunar surface.\nThe commander (CDR) was photographed by\nthe LM pilot (LMP) from the LM window before\nhe stepped to the lunar surface during the lirst\nEVA. The CDR photographed the LMP\'s descent\nto the surface with the DAC.

Panoramas at key points along the extended traverse to Cone Crater and documentation photographs of specific features to support\nthe objectives of the geology experiment are discussed in detail in section 3. The crew photographed the lunar-surface area that was visible\nthrough the LM windows after the end of EVA-2.\nStriking differences in the shadows recorded by\nthe two series of pictures demonstrate the change\nin Sun angle between the EVA periods.\nThe 16-mm DAC, mounted in the LMP\'s\nwindow, recorded the best ascent photographs obtained to date. The 16-mm camera recorded the\n\ninitial sharp interaction between the ascent-engine\nplume and the nearby natural or manmade objects. The motion picture records a spectacular\nview of the receding lunar surface as the LM\nfirst lifted and then moved westward away from\nthe Fra Mauro site. Ascent occurred during the\nnear-side pass of revolution 31. The docking maneuver, during revolution 32, was photographed\nfrom both spacecraft. The CSM cameras photographed the LM jettison during revolution 33.\nThe Hasselblad EL with the 500-mm lens was\nsubstituted for the malfunctioning LTC to photograph the predicted impact point of the Apollo 14\nSIVB stage during revolution 35.\nAfter the successful transearth-injection burn\nnear the start of revolution 35, the CSM cameras\nwere unstowed. Several sequences of photographs\nwere acquired with a variety of camera-lens-film\ncombinations as the spacecraft left the Moon.\nLater, during the transearth coast, the DAC\nrecorded activities within the CM. Two in-flight\ndemonstrations (heat flow and liquid transfer)\nwerc photographed during this period.\nRepresentative mission photographs taken between the time of docking during translunar coast\nand the transearth coast are shown in figures 1-1\nto 1-39.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHIC SUMMARY\n\n13\n\nI~IGURE 1-1.-The\nLM stowed in the\nSIVB stage during the transposition\nand docking maneuver.

Crew Observations\nAlan B . Shepard," Edgar D . Mitchell," and Stuart A . Roosa"\n\nThe Apollo 14 mission expanded the techniques\nand relaxed the operational limitations of previous\nlunar-landing missions. The specific differences\nbetween this mission and the previous missions\nincluded onboard cislunar navigation, the use of\nthe service propulsion system for descent orbit\ninsertion, landing in the lunar highlands, extended\nlunar-surface exploration time for scientific investigation, and a single-orbit rendezvous of the\nspacecraft. The operational use of these extended\ncapabilities has been an important step in the\nsystematic scientific exploration of the Moon.\nThis section is a summary of the scientific observations of the Apollo 14 crew. Included are\ncomments on the appearance of the Earth and\nMoon during cislunar flight and lunar orbit,\nobservations from the surface of lunar terrain\nfeatures, descriptions of crew mobility in the lunar\nenvironment, and geological and soil-mechanics\nobservations made during the two extravehicular\nactivity (EVA) periods.\nObservations During Translunar Coast\n\nAt approximately 04:OO G.m.t., February 2,\n1971, we began the dim-light photography of the\ndark side of the Earth. We had some doubts as to\nthe quality of the photographs obtained because of\nthe amount of light scatter visible in the sextant.\nAt approximately 09:OO G.m.t., February 2,\nthe Moon appeared to be about the size of an\norange held at arm\'s length. It also began to show\ntexture and to take on grayish-brown colors, as\nopposed to the bright appearance seen from Earth.\nAt that time, the view of Earth had Australia at\nthe bottom of the lighted area with the view up\n,\' NASA Manned Spacecraft Center.\n\nacross the Philippines showing extensive cloud\ncover.\nLunar-Surface Features as Seen From\nLunar Orbit\n\nOur first good look at the lunar surface was\nwhen we went into lunar orbit. All the grays,\nbrowns, and whites that have been described by\nprevious crews were visible. The best description\nthat could be given was that the Moon looked like\na plaster mold that had been dusted with grays\nand browns. All landmarks were clearly visible\nand very easy to distinguish. One surprising feature was the fresh appearance of many of the\ncraters; they looked much fresher than photographs had led us to believe.\nAt the approach to the terminator, some relatively high crater walls and high country cast long\nshadows that made the surface look very rugged.\nWe could just see the eastern rim of Gambart\nCrater, and the western rim was just barely\nlighted. The streaks that have been noted on previous missions were quite pronounced and seemed\nto lead back toward the Imbrian and Copernican\nareas.\nWhen we were directly over the terminator and\nwere looking down into the craters with features\nright on the terminator, it was difficult to determine exactly what we were seeing. Even when we\nknew what we were supposed to see, the features\nwere difficult to distinguish. As we crossed the\nterminator, the lack of dark adaptation made it\nappear as though one could walk along that surface into the darkness and fall into nothing. At\nthat point, there appeared to be absolutely nothing\nbeyond the terminator.\nAfter the descent orbit insertion, it appeared\n33\n\n34\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nthat we were very low. As a matter of fact, we had\nthe illusion that the flightpath was actually lower\nthan some of the peaks on the horizon. The scale\nwas so deceptive that the terrain made it appear\nas though the altitude could have been approximately 500 ft. The brown mountains that had appeared to have a soft blanket at the higher altitude looked very harsh at the lower altitude.\nHowever, the regolith appeared smoother and\nmore hummocky than it had at the higher altitude.\nThe surface appeared much smoother at altitudes\nat which closer detail could be seen; particularly\nat higher Sun angles, it appeared to be a softer\nsurface. It was certainly an unusual experience\nflying at so low an altitude.\nWe passed over Mosting Crater and noted that\nit was a bench crater with an almost-vertical drop\non the east side. Both the east and west sides\nappeared to be solid rock. The regolith nearby appeared soft and not at all rubbly. After crossing\nto the dark side of the terminator and without\nbeing dark adapted, we could see a very definite\nhorizon through the optics. The craters that have\nbright rims were visible in the earthshine, although\ngenerally the surface was a soft gray without many\ndistinct features.\nLanding and Observations From the\nLunar Module\n\nShortly after pitchover, Cone Crater and the\nlanding site came into view out the window, confirming the accuracy of the flightpath. The Sun\nangle was good, and we were able to recognize\nthe landing site even more rapidly than we could\non the lunar-module (LM) simulator display at\nKennedy Space Center. Manual descent was initiated at 350-ft altitude and approximately 2200 ft\nshort of the desired target. We held a zero descent\nrate at 170 ft while performing a translation maneuver forward and to the right so contact would\noccur at the original targeted point. Blowing dust\nwas first noted at 110 ft, but it was not a deterrent\nfactor. The blowing dust appeared to be less than\n6 in. deep, and rocks were readily visible through\nit. The LM landed on a slope with the front hatch\non an azimuth of approximately 275 " with respect\nto lunar north. The slope at the landing site was\napproximately 8", but the landing site was the\nflattest place around.\n\nThe landing site was very close to the preplanned point but possibly a bit toward Triplet\nCrater. The LM appeared to be in a bowllike\ndepression. We were looking directly toward\nDoublet Crater, which appeared to be 25 to 30 ft\nabove us. A pronounced ridge beyond Doublet\nCrater formed the skyline and was the highest\nfeature in front of the LM. To the north was a\nlarge old depression that formed another bowl\nsimilar to the one in which the LM appeared to\nhave landed. We could see several ridges and rolling hills approximately 35 to 40 ft high-obviously very, very old craters that were almost\nindistinct-between the LM and the horizon to\nthe north. A few boulders were scattered around\nbetween the LM and Doublet Crater. The largest\nboulder in view was approximately 3 ft across and\nlocated at an azimuth of approximately 350"\nabout 150 ft away. There were two or three other\ncraters about half as big approximately 30 to 45\nft farther away. No pattern in the arrangement of\nthe boulders was apparent. The color of the surface was a kind of mouse brown or mouse gray\nand obviously changed with the Sun angle.\nNumerous craters were present in the field of\nview-some old, very subdued; some overlapped\nby newer craters; and some that seemed to be relatively recent. A small pattern of four craters was\nlocated at approximately the 290"-to-350\xc2\xb0 position. The crater at the 290" position and approximately 50 ft from the LM was approximately 15\nft across and had a secondary crater in the middle\nof it and two or three craters grouped on the north\nedge. Immediately in front of the LM, approximately 15 ft away, was a 6- or 7-ft-wide crater\nthat was pocked with a few secondary craters. The\ncrater at the 305" position was an old crater\napproximately 12 ft in diameter with a fairly\nsmall, relatively fresh 1-ft-diameter crater on the\nsouthwest side. The fourth crater was at the 350"\nposition; this crater was approximately 40 f t away\nand had a diameter of approximately 25 ft.\nSome linear features were noted on the surface.\nWe did not discuss the nearby lineations because\nthey could be confused with the descent-engine\npattern. However, farther to the north we noted\nlineations that appeared to be oriented approximately north of west to south of east. The lineations were very fine grained and were almost im-\n\n35\n\nCREW OBSERVATIONS\n\nperceptible except that a little shadow effect was\nvisible, almost sand duning but not quite. Although they were plainly visible from the LM, we\nwere not sure that the lineations would not disappear once we egressed from the LM.\nFirst EVA Period\nLunar-Surface Visibility\n\nThe visibility on the lunar surface was generally\nthe same as has been reported on previous lunar\nmissions. It was noted that, when we were going\ndown-Sun, there seemed to be a refraction around\nour bodies. This refraction caused a halo effect\nin our shadows, and we could not see surface details directly in front of us. Judgment of distance\nseemed to be somewhat distorted on the lunar\nsurface, and we had a definite tendency to underestimate distances to terrain features, perhaps\nbecause of the lack of atmosphere. In addition,\nboulders were much smaller than they had appeared to be in photographs.\nMobilify\n\nMobility and stability on the lunar surface were\ngenerally the same as reported on the Apollo 11\nand 12 missions. With a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 adjustment,\neach individual found a method of travel suited to\nhim. The step-and-hop gait appeared to require a\nminimum of effort. There was very little tendency\nto overcontrol or use too much force when using\ntools or walking on the lunar surface. We had very\nlittle difficulty pulling the modularized equipment\ntransporter (MET)-it proved to be quite stable.\nThe MET bounced when it hit a small rise, but\nit had little tendency to overturn.\nSoil Mechanics\n\nOn the surface, it was noted that the landing\narea appeared to be in a swale or wide valley\nbetween Triplet and Doublet Craters. The landing\npoint was on the downhill side; the slope leveled\noff at a lower elevation, approximately 15 ft\nlower than the LM, and started back up to the\nrim of Doublet Crater. The area was pockmarked,\nas are most sections of the Moon, by an enormous\nnumber of craters.\nThe soil was extremely soft and fine grained,\nalmost like a brown talcum powder. There appeared to be very few rocks of any appreciable\n\nsize in the immediate area of the LM; most of the\nrocks were less than 2 in. in diameter. The surface\non which the forward footpad landed was so soft\nthe soil came all the way to the top of the footpad\nand even folded over the sides to some degree.\nVery little erosion was seen directly under the\nengine bell. Most of the erosion seemed to be\napproximately 3 ft to the southeast, which was\napparently where the thrust was directed when the\nengine was cut off; the LM drifted northwest from\nthat point just before touchdown. The erosion\npattern appeared to be no more than 4 in. deep.\nExperiment Deploymenf\n\nSeveral minor problems developed during the\ndeployment of the experiments. We had difficulty\nreleasing one of the Boyd bolts on the Apollo\nlunar-surface experiments package (ALSEP) subpallet when the guide cup became full of dirt.\nThere seems to be no way of avoiding getting the\nexperiments dirty during transport and deployment. On the traverse to the deployment site, the\nALSEP pallets on either end of the mast oscillated\nvertically and the mast flexed, making the assembly rather diEcult to carry. However, it is believed\nthe present arrangement is suitable for traverses\nof as much as 150 yd.\nDuring deployment of the suprathermal ion\ndetector experiment (SIDE) and the cold cathode\ngage experiment (CCGE) , considerable difficulty\nwas experienced with the stiffness of the interconnecting cable. Whenever an attempt was made\nto move the CCGE, the cable caused the SIDE\nto tip over. However, after several minutes of\nreadjusting the experiments, we managed to\ndeploy them successfully.\nThe three active-seismic-experiment geophones\nwere deployed with very little difficulty. The geophones went into the soft surface material readily;\nhowever, moving the cable pulled the second geophone out of the soil and it had to be replaced.\nOn the return to the LM after ALSEP deployment, we gathered samples from a selected area.\nIncluded in these samples were two Little League\nfootball-size rocks. One of the football-size rocks\nappeared to contain a fairly large crystal.\nOne thing that was noted upon return to the\nLM was that our footprints and the MET tracks,\nboth to the ALSEP site and to the camera, were\n\n36\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\na darker color in the disturbed area. Both crossSun and down-Sun, the dirt that had been kicked\nup and turned over was noticeably darker than\nthe mousy brown of the undisturbed regolith.\n\nSecond EVA Period\nObservations on the Geological Traverse\nAt station A, the surface, although basically\nthe same fine-grained dusty regolith, was textured\nand contained more small pebbles than the soil in\nthe vicinity of the LM. The texture appeared to\nhave been splattered with raindrops. There seemed\nto be a definite relationship between the texture\nand the small pebbles.\nWe deployed the lunar portable magnetometer\n(LPM) and relayed the readings to Mission Control Center. We had trouble when attempting to\nreel in the LPM cable. The set in the cable was\nsuch that, if the handle was released, the cable\nwould unwind three or four turns. We wound it\nin enough to keep it off the ground and proceeded\nwith the traverse.\nThe closer we progressed toward Cone Crater,\nthe more boulders we encountered. The basic\nsurface material was still the same fine-grained\ngrayish brown with the raindrop effect. The MET\ntracks, approximately 0.25 in. deep, made a very\nsmooth pattern reminiscent of that made by driving a tractor through a plowed field.\nStation B was an area with considerably more\nboulders. Many of the boulders were buried or\nhalf buried, with only a few of the smaller ones\nlying on the surface. Most of these boulders were\nrounded; only a few were angular. We could see\nedges that had been chipped off, indicating the\nbeginning of a smoothing process. Some of the\nboulders were well beyond the beginning stage of\nthis smoothing process-most of the rough edges\nhad fractured and fallen off the parent boulder.\nCone Crater Area\nCloser to Cone Crater, the Sun angle and the\nslope made it difficult to determine an exact location. We reached a large boulder field that covered\nperhaps as much as a square mile. Most of the\nboulders were the same grayish brown that had\nbeen previously noted. However, we noticed one\nboulder that was almost white. We documented\n\nthis boulder and chipped a sample from it. We\nsaw another boulder that had been broken open,\nand the broken surface appeared white while the\noutside was the normal brownish color. Grab\nsamples, including another football-size sample,\nwere taken in that area.\nJust before inspecting the white boulder, we\ndeployed the LPM for the second and last reading.\nAfter some difficulty in leveling the instrument, we\nrelayed the reading on the voice link. The LPM\nwas discarded at the completion of this reading.\nThe soil in the area of the second LPM measurement appeared to have a lighter brown layer below the darker brown regolith. We attempted to\nobtain a core-tube sample of the color layers, but\nwe could only get the core tube about threequarters of the way into the surface; when the\ntube was withdrawn, the soil was so granular that\nmost of it came out of the tube.\nAt a site approximately one crater diameter\nfrom North Triplet Crater, we collected trench\nsamples and attempted to obtain a triple-core-tube\nsample. However, in two attempts, we could not\nget samples beyond the first core tube. A problem\nwas also experienced with the trench sample in\nthat the soft regolith kept falling into the trench.\nAs the trench was dug, at least three different\nlayers were noted: the surface layer, which was\nbrown; a second layer that appeared to have quite\na bit of black; and a third layer of very light material. The second layer was very thin (no more\nthan 0.25 in.) and consisted of small glassylike\npebbles. Before leaving the Triplet site, we\ngathered documented samples and several grab\nsamples, including one of the whitish rocks.\nOn the return to the LM, the commander made\na side trip to the ALSEP to verify the alinement\nof the antenna on the ALSEP central station.\nAfter making a small alinement correction, we\ncollected a few samples and returned to the LM,\nretrieved the solar-wind composition foil, stowed\nthe samples and equipment, and prepared for\nliftoff.\n\nOrbital Operations\nThe orbital photographic and scientific experiments conducted by the command module pilot\nsimultaneously with the surface exploration in-\n\nCREW OBSERVATIONS\n\ncluded the gegenschein photography, the bistaticradar experiment, the S-band transponder experiment, surface landmark tracing, and bootstrap\nphotography using the Hycon and Hasselblad\ncameras.\nThe gegenschein photography was performed\non orbit 16. The new window shade worked very\nwell; to be doubly safe about inadvertent light\nstrikes, the floodlight near the window was taped.\nThe bistatic-radar and S-band transponder experiments were performed on schedule. The\nspacecraft was configured as planned and the\nexperiments appeared to have been satisfactory.\nThe landmark tracking was accomplished with\nno significant difficulties. On the first pass over\nthe Apollo 14 site, I saw a white spot that was\nobviously foreign to the typical lunar surface. I\nsuspected the spot was the LM and my suspicion\nwas verified when I saw the LM shadow. The first\nday I tracked the LM, the Sun angle was still fairly\nlow and the shadow of the LM was plainly visible.\nThe shape of the LM could not be seen as such,\nbut there was no doubt it was there. The next day,\nwhile doing landmark tracking, I had one landmark just before the Fra Mauro region and one\nafter it, so I looked for the LM again. This time\nI saw the LM without any difficulty. The LM\nshadow had diminished considerably; but, by that\ntime, the ALSEP had been deployed and the glint\ncoming off it was easy to see.\n\n37\n\nThe bootstrap photography was accomplished\nusing the 70-mm Hasselblad camera with a\n500-mm lens after the failure of the Hycon lunar\ntopographic camera. By using the crewmanoptical-alinement-sight maneuver to hold the\ncamera on target, I apparently obtained some\ngood stereophotographs of the Descartes landing\narea. Three passes were made over the Descartes\narea to obtain stereostrips covering the region.\nAscent From the Lunar Surface\n\nWhen the hot-fire test of the jets was performed\nbefore liftoff, the erectable S-band antenna blew\nover. The liftoff was smooth and the ascent engine\nperformed quite satisfactorily. When we pitched\nover and looked at the landing site, we could see\nthe gold-and-silver Kapton insulation flying out\nfrom the descent stage in a radial pattern and\nparallel to the lunar surface, just as had been\nreported by the Apollo 11 and 12 crews.\nThe last of the scientific objectives was accomplished when we made another series of dimlight photographs of the dark side of the Earth.\nOn the transearth coast, the same problem with\nscattered light was experienced as during translunar coast. Upon completing the photography, we\nbegan preparing for the final phase of our return\nto Earth.\n\n3. Preliminary Geologic Investigations of the\nApollo 74 Landing Site\nG. A . Swann,"f N . G .

The landing site is 1230 km\nsouth of the center of the Imbrium Basin and 550\nkm south of the southern rim crest of the basin.\nThis site was selected to study a lunar stratigraphic\nunit called the Fra Mauro Formation, which\ncovers a substantial part of the earthward lunar\nsurface. The formation is a broad belt surrounding\nMare Imbrium and is believed to be material excavated by a large impact that formed the Imbrium\nBasin.\nThe LM landed about 1100 m west of Cone\nCrater, which is located on a ridge of Fra Mauro\nFormation. Cone Crater is a sharp-rimmed, relatively young crater approximately 340 m in diameter that ejected blocks of material up to 15 m\nacross, which were derived from beneath the\nregolith. Sampling and photography of these\nblocks were primary objectives of the mission.\nRays of blocky ejecta from Cone Crater extend\nwestward beyond the landing site. The landing\ntook place on a smooth terrain unit recognized\nin premission Lunar Orbiter and Apollo orbital\nphotography. Sampling and description of this\nunit were other main objectives of the mission.\nDuring the first period of extravehicular activity\n(EVA), the crew traversed westward over the\nsmooth terrain for a round-trip distance of ap-\n\n+\n\nU.S. Geological Survey.\nNASA Manned Spacecraft Center.\nPrincipal investigator.\n\nproximately 550 m (fig. 3-1) and deployed\nthe Apollo lunar-surface experiments package\n(ALSEP). Sixty-nine rock samples for which\nlocations have been determined were collected by\nthe crew: seven in the contingency sample, 29 in\nthe comprehensive sample, 31 in the bulk sample,\nand two small football-size rocks.\nThe crew covered a round-trip distance of approximately 2900 m (eastward from the LM\nduring the second EVA (fig. 3-1)). During the\ntraverse, they crossed the smooth terrain, the\nFra Mauro ridge unit, and a section through the\ncontinuous ejecta blanket of Cone Crater to\nwithin 20 m of the crater rim crest. Forty-eight\nrock samples, the locations of which have been\ndetermined, were collected at points along the\ntraverse. The modularized equipment transporter\n(MET) was used to transport the samples and\ncollection tools.\nDetailed analysis of surface photographs of\nboulders ejected from Cone Crater and comparison of these photographs with returned samples\nindicate that the Fra Mauro Formation is mainly\ncomposed of moderately coherent breccias in\nwhich dark lithic clasts up to 50 cm or more\nacross and less abundant light clasts are set in a\nlight matrix. Subordinate rock types that may be\npart of the Fra Mauro Formation include coherent\nbreccias with about equal amounts of light and\ndark clasts and breccias with irregular bands of\nvery light clastic rock.\nBoulders ejected from Cone Crater record a\n39\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY S C I E N C E REPORT\n\n40\n\nI 111111\n100 0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n500\n\nExplanation\n\n[ T I\n1\n\nI\n\nContact\nM a t e r i a l s of Cone Crater\n\n----\n\nSmooth terrain material of the\nF r a Mauro Formation\n\nI\n\nIfr\n\nLong dashed l i n e s indicate approximate\nlocations, and short dashed l i n e s\nindicate location i s inferred without\nl o c a l evidence.\nFoot of scarp\n\nRidge material of the F r a Mauro\nFormation\n\nU\n\nThe line bounds a small mesa, and the\ntriangles point downslope.

Earlier events, presumably relating to\nthe origin of the Fra Mauro Formation or older\nejecta blankets, include lithologic layering, deformation, and induration of the breccias. Clasts\nof breccia within the breccias may represent preImbrian cratering in the Imbrium Basin region.\nPhotographic surveys taken during the Apollo\n14 lunar stay were designed to accomplish the\nfollowing tasks:\n( 1 ) Locate and illustrate topographic features\nat each major geologic station\n(2) Record the surface characteristics of each\nsample area and determine the orientation and\nlocation on the lunar surface of the samples at the\ntime of collection\n(3) Document geologic targets of opportunity\nOther photographic surveys were taken to document the deployment of the ALSEP and the soil\nmechanics experiment.\nFour hundred and seventeen photographs were\ntaken on the lunar surface with the Hasselblad\nElectric data camera during the Apollo 14 mission. Fifteen panoramas, consisting of 275 photographs, were taken for major station location\nand general geologic documentation, of which 10\nare included in this report (figs. 3-2 to 3-11).\nForty-nine pictures were taken for sample documentation, and 27 pictures were taken to document ALSEP deployment. The remaining pictures\nwere of miscellaneous targets of opportunity.\n\nThe major geologic stations were located on a\nrectified copy of Lunar Orbiter 3 frame H-133 by\nfeature correlation between the Hasselblad and\nLunar Orbiter photographs and by resection.\n\nGeology of the Fra Mauro Landing Site\nThe surface of the Moon is grossly divided into\nrelatively dark, low-lying plains or maria, and the\nbrighter, generally more rugged areas of the terra.\nThe maria, sites of the Apollo 1 1 and 12 landings,\nare densely covered with craters from several\ncentimeters to a few hundred meters in diameter,\nwith a scattering of larger craters up to a few tens\nof kilometers in diameter. Much of the terra, site\nof the Apollo 14 landing, is densely covered with\ncraters several tens of kilometers in diameter;\nbefore the Apollo 14 mission, Lunar Orbiter and\nApollo photographs showed that small craters are\nalso present on the terra in large numbers down\nto sizes of a few meters.\nRegional Geologic Setting\n\nThe Fra Mauro Formation (refs. 3-1 and\n3-2) is an extensive blanketlike deposit lying in a\nbroad band around the Imbrium Basin (fig. 3-12;\nrefs. 3-3 and 3-4) and is interpreted as ejecta\nfrom the impact that formed the basin. Stratigraphic relationships around the margin of the\nImbrium Basin show that a significant number of\ngeologic events occurred between the formation\nof the basin and its later filling by mare material\n(refs. 3-2 and 3-5). These events included formation of large craters such as Archimedes,\n\n42\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n4\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n.*\nc\nd\n\nc\n\nc\nv)\n\n0\n.*\nc\nd\n\nc\nm\n\n.4\n.\n\nm\n\ni\n-\n\nd\n\nE,\n9\nPI\n1.\nm\n\ns\n\nm\nI\n\n%\nc\n\nt-"\n\n8\n1\n\n8\n1\nc\n\no"\nc\n\n8\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATIONS OF APOLLO 14 LANDING SITE\n\nei\n\na\n\n%\n!\n\nC\n\nc\n\n.\nY\n3\n\n.\nY\n3\n\n0\n\na\n*\nul\nY\n\n2\n\n0\n\na\n\nc\nv1\nY\n\n4\n*\n\n0;\n\n4\n\ni\n2\n\n$\n\n0\nC\n\ni\n,\nc\n\n0\n.\nYI\n\nm\n\n*\nul\n*\nm\n\n0\n\n%\n\n+I\n.\n\n43\n\n8\n\n2\n\n2\nY\n\n4\n\n3\n\nm\n\n3\n!\n\nLI\n\n0\n\n9\n\nk\nI\nw\n\n9\n&\n\nrn\nI\n\nn\nI\n\nm\n\n2\n\ng\n\nw\n\n3\n\n!\n!\ncrc\n\nI\nt-:\n\ng\n\niz\n\na\nw\nI\n\n2\n\niz\n\n44\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATIONS OF APOLLO 14 LANDING SITE\n\nemplacement of the relatively light terra plains\nmaterials, and, in the western part of the Moon,\nformation of the Orientale Basin.

In this area,\nthe formation generally grades southward from a\nridged deposit to a complexly cratered one. The\nridges are the most characteristic feature of the\nFra Mauro Formation. Locally, somewhat flatter\ntracts, typically measuring a few kilometers across,\nhave slightly lower albedos than those of the ridges\nand occur in shallow surface depressions of the\nFra Mauro Formation. Some of these are mapped\nas a smoother Fra Mauro component and others\nas possible overlying accumulations of volcanic,\nprobably pyroclastic, material. Elsewhere, distinct\nplains-forming units of the terra that are obviously\nyounger than the Fra Mauro Formation have been\nmapped, and these are, in turn, overlapped by still\nyounger dark plains of the maria (fig. 3-12).\nSome hills in the area appear to be volcanoes\nsuperposed on the Fra Mauro Formation, and\nother similar but more heavily cratered hills may\nbe volcanoes that were formed before the Fra\nMauro Formation was deposited.\nRidges of the Fra Mauro Formation in the vicinity of the landing site are mostly 1 to 4 km\nwide, a few to several tens of meters high, and\nfrom five to 10 times as long as they are wide.\nThe ridges are slightly sinuous and roughly radial\nto the Imbrium Basin. Comparison of the Imbrium\nBasin with the younger and better preserved\nOrientale Basin suggests that the ridges were\nformed largely by flowage of material (probably\nfragmental rock debris) radially along the ground\nduring excavation of the basin. Fracturing of the\npre-Fra Mauro Formation rocks in a pattern\nradial to the Imbrium Basin may also have contributed, at least locally, to the relief of the ridges.\nThe major geologic objectives of the mission\nwere to describe, photograph, and sample the\nejecta blanket of the 340-m-diameter Cone Crater\n(fig. 3-1 ) . This crater is situated on one of the\nridges that may be Fra Mauro Formation material that flowed radially outward from the Imbrium\nBasin. Lunar Orbiter photographs indicate that\nthe crater penetrates below the fine-grained lunar\nregolith into a blocky or bedrock substrate.

At least four, old, moderately subdued,\n200- to 1000-m-diameter craters, which are older\nthan Cone Crater, are cut into the Fra Mauro\nridge north, east, and south of Cone Crater within\nseveral hundred meters of the rim crest of Cone\nCrater. Rim deposits of these older craters are\nessentially unrecognizable photogeologically, but\nsome unmodified remnants are to be expected at\ndepth under the regolith formed since deposition\nof these rim materials. The interiors of these\ncraters have slopes of 10\xe2\x80\x9d to 15\xe2\x80\x9d as do the slopes\nof the Fra Mauro ridge. Cone Crater is approximately 340 m in diameter. The rim of Cone Crater\nis moderately to densely strewn with 2- to 15-m\nblocks as seen in Lunar Orbiter 3 high-resolution\nphotography (fig. 3-1 3 ) . Spacings between blocks\nof a few to several meters are common in several\ndense patches extending as far out as 125 m from\nthe rim crest. In the remainder of the mapped rim\ndeposit, spacings as much as several tens of meters\nbetween blocks 2 m across and larger are common.\nIn addition to these major units, the Apollo 14\nlanding site is dotted with abundant craters ranging in diameter from several hundred meters down\nto the limit of resolution of the hand-held cameras\nand in morphology from relatively fresh to almost\ncompletely obliterated. Craters in the size range\nfrom 400 m to 1 km are both more numerous and\nmore subdued than craters in the same size range\nin the lunar maria; this distribution is consistent\nwith the inferred greater age of the Fra Mauro\nFormation. The slope of the cumulative crater-size\nfrequency-distribution curve on the Fra Mauro\nFormation between diameters of 1 km and 400 m\nis approximately -2 and lies close to the theoretical steady-state curve suggested in references\n3-7 and 3-8 and in figure 3-14. In sizes below\nthe 400-m category, fewer craters are located on\nthe Fra Mauro Formation than on the mare\nmaterial, an anomaly probably caused by a combination of thicker regolith and higher slopes at\nthe Fra Mauro site. Small craters in the lunar\nregolith probably are being destroyed at a faster\nrate by downslope movement of loose debris on\nthe rolling hills of the Fra Mauro area than on\nthe more level surfaces. The fact that the walls\nof the trench dug by the Apollo 14 commander\n(CDR) caved in quickly and his comment that\nmany small craters in the area appeared to be\n\nLunar Orbiter 4: 120H3---\n\nSteady-state curve\n101\n\n102\n103\nCrater diameter, m\n\nio4\n\nFIGURE\n3-14.-Cumulative size-frequency distribution of\ncraters on the lunar surface at the Apollo 14 site\ncompared to crater distributions at the Apollo 1 1 and\n12 sites.\n\nslumped are significant in this regard. From a consideration of the diameters of craters having\nblocky ejecta blankets, the regolith in the Fra\nMauro region is estimated to range from 10 to\n20 m in thickness.\nVariations in morphology of craters in the site\nindiqte a homologous series of craters of different ages. The age sequence of craters along the\ntraverses from oldest to youngest (ref. 3-6 and\nfig. 3-13) is interpreted as follows:\n(1) Highly subdued craters expressed as very\ngentle depressions at the landing site of the LM,\nwest of the LM in the area of ALSEP deployment,\nand north of station A\n(2) The crater designated \xe2\x80\x9cNorth Triplet,\xe2\x80\x9d the\nmoderately subdued 50-m crater east of station F,\nand the moderately subdued 10-m crater at station A\n\n48\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n(3) Cone Crater and the sharp 45-m crater at\nstation E\n(4) The sharp 300-m crater at station C\xe2\x80\x99 and\nthe small 10-m crater next to which a football-size\nrock was collected on the first EVA\n\nPreliminary Interpretations\nTwelve 360\xe2\x80\x9d panoramas were taken during the\nfirst and second EVA periods. Three of these were\ntaken within a triangle around the LM during the\nfirst EVA, and nine were taken along the traverse\nroute during the second EVA. Lunar-surface characteristics as seen in the panoramas are markedly\ndifferent in the vicinity of Cone Crater from those\nat panorama stations more than a crater diameter\naway from Cone Crater. The distribution of\nboulders in the traverse area and the distribution\nof rocks greater than 20 cm in diameter at the\npanorama stations are shown in figure 3-13. The\nLM landing point and station A are in areas where\nrock fragments larger than 2 or 3 cm in diameter\nare sparse. Stations B, F, and G are in areas where\nrock fragments up to 10 to 20 cm in diameter are\ncommon, and stations B2, B3, and C\xe2\x80\x99 are in areas\nof abundant rock fragments greater than 20 cm\nin diameter. Station H has a moderate number of\nrock fragments greater than 20 cm in diameter.\nRock fragments up to large boulder size are\ncommon east of station B1 and become increasingly abundant from just east of station B1 to B2\nto C\xe2\x80\x99. The continuous ejecta blanket from Cone\nCrater extends from the rim crest west to between\nstations B2 and B1 and is probably only patchy\nin the vicinity of station B1. Farther west across\nthe landing site, Cone Crater ejecta probably\noccur only as isolated patches or along rays.\nSurface material is noticeably finer grained at\nthe LM and at stations A, B1, B2, F, G, and H\nthan at stations B3 and C\xe2\x80\x99. The topography where\nthe surface material is finer is broadly undulating\nat wavelengths ranging from tens to hundreds of\nmeters and amplitudes up to approximately 10 m.\nThis topography characterizes old eroded craters,\nmostly of Eratosthenian and early Copernican\nages. The topography at stations B3 and C\xe2\x80\x99 is\nundulating at wavelengths ranging from several\ncentimeters up to several meters and amplitudes\n\nup to a meter or two. The undulatory surface\ntopography in the vicinity of stations B3 and C\xe2\x80\x99\nprobably reflects the original hummocky ejecta\ndeposits from Cone Crater.\nThe Apollo 14 crew briefly described a raindrop pattern, similar to that previously described\nby the Apollo 12 crew, in the vicinity of station A.\nThis pattern is readily seen in all the panoramas,\nexcept B3 and C\xe2\x80\x99, and in some of the sample\ndocumentation photographs. The patterns are\nbest illustrated by NASA photographs AS14-679390 to AS14-67-9393, which were taken at low\nSun angle during the fist EVA. The raindrop\npatterns on the fine-grained surface material appear to consist of small craterlets up to 4 cm in\ndiameter. Shadows from very small fragments on\nthe surface tend to enhance falsely the raindrop\nappearance in some of the photographs. The raindrop patterns are probably formed by impact of\nsmall meteorites and by secondary particles from\nthese impacts. A raindrop craterlet 1 cm deep\nwould be destroyed by subsequent impacts in\nabout 3 million yr (ref. 3-8), so that a fresh\nsurface should become more or less saturated by\n4-cm craterlets in this time span. The rounding of\nboulders ejected from Cone Crater suggests that\nit is much older than 3 million yr and also that\nsmall impacts are numerous; yet the raindrop\npattern is much less evident in the ejecta blanket\nthan in the western part of the area. Downslope\nmovement of material, which would tend to destroy the craterlets, appears to have occurred on\nthe steeper slopes on which the ejecta blanket was\nlaid. Furthermore, the formation of craterlets\nwould be impeded by the coarseness of the debris\non the ejecta blanket. Fine-grained hummocks a\nfew centimeters in wavelength and in amplitude\ntend to obscure the craterlets. Also, the higher\nSun angle during the time the crew spent on the\nejecta blanket as compared to the lower Sun angle\nduring the first EVA makes the craterlets less\nconspicuous than those photographed during the\nfirst EVA.\nSmall lineaments similar to those seen in the\nApollo 11 and 12 photographs were described\nG.

Acta.\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATIONS OF APOLLO 14 LANDING SITE\n\nby the crew and are visible in some of the photographs. These lineaments are described in more\ndetail in another portion of this section.\nOptical Properties of Surface Materials\n\nOptical properties of selected lunar materials\nwere measured from black-and-white photographs\ntaken along the geologic traverse during the second EVA. Comparisons of optical properties of\nthe returned lunar samples with the in situ optical\nproperties provide a basis for recognition of\nsimilar materials in lunar-surface photographs.\nPhotometric data were obtained from a firstgeneration film positive by microdensitometry\nwith a 100-pm-diameter circular aperture. Film\nluminances were calculated from the sensitometric\nstep wedge on the processed fl and the reported\nim\ncamera settings used during lunar photography.\nPhotographs that include the gnomon and photometric chart have their own internal calibration\nbecause the sensitometric luminances of the\ngnomon and chart steps are compared with the\nluminances computed from the preflight goniophotometric calibration of the gray steps. Scene\nluminances measured from the film were adjusted\nfor frame shading and then compared to the expected luminance derived from the lunar photometric angles, a lunar photometric function, and\nan assumed solar irradiance of 13 000 lm.\nScene luminances from the fine-grained surface\nmaterial were measured from documented sample\nphotographs, selected panoramas, and selected\nphotography of prominent rocks. Measurements\nwere made at the lowest phase angles possible for\nbest accuracy because lunar reflectance decreases\nrapidly with increasing phase angle and the uncertainties in the local lunar photometric function\nat larger phase angles increase the errors. Comparisons of reflectance from lunar materials are\nmade at the same phase angle wherever possible.\nAll general comparisons between areas of measurements are made by projecting the measured\nluminance to the zero-phase-angle luminance\n(albedo) by means of the lunar photometric\nfunction.\nThe albedo variation of undisturbed finegrained material along the geologic traverse ranges\nfrom 8.2 to 15 percent. The albedo variation of\n\n49\n\nthe lower and smoother areas (stations A, B, G,\nand G1) ranges from 8.2 to 9.1 percent. Additional measurements of the albedo of the lower\nsmooth-terrain unit were made from panoramic\nphotographs taken toward the west from station\nC\xe2\x80\x99. These photographs indicate that the smoothterrain unit albedos vary from 8.2 to 8.4 percent.\nThe small albedo variation (8.2 to 9.1 percent)\nover the undulating smooth-terrain unit, excluding\nbright ray or crater-wall materials, is similar to\nthe albedos of typical mare landing areas (Le.,\nthe Apollo 12 and Surveyor 3, 5 , and 6 sites).\nAt all previous lunar-landing sites, disturbed\nregolith reflected less light than adjacent undisturbed material; the decrease in reflectivities\nranged from 5 to 26 percent. Disturbed materials\naround the Apollo 14 LM and over the smooth\nunit show decreased reflectivities of 5 to 11 percent. The disturbed materials on the flank of Cone\nCrater commonly show little, if any, decreased\nreflectivity.\nThe measured and extrapolated normal albedo\nof selected rocks varies from 9.4 to 36.4 percent.\nThe range of rock albedo measured from Surveyor\nphotographs is 9 to 22 percent (ref. 3-9) , whereas\nApollo 12 measurements range from 12 to 18\npercent. The highest reflectance ever measured\nor observed on the lunar surface is around station\nc1.\nThe rocks in photographs AS14-68-9448 to\nAS14-68-9453 (shown later in figs. 3-20 and\n3-29 ( a ) ) exhibit large variations in reflectance\nfrom their component parts, ranging from approximately 9 to 36 percent luminance variation.\nThe large rock shown in photograph AS14-689449 contains dark clasts and a light band in a\ngray matrix and exhibits extrapolated albedos of\n16 percent from dark clasts, 20 percent from gray\nmatrix, and approximately 36 percent from the\nlight-gray band.\nLineaments\n\nPreliminary evaluation of small-scale surface\nlineaments at the Apollo 14 site revealed two\nprimary (northwest and northeast) and one secondary (north) azimuthal trends (figs. 3-15 and\n3-16). The lineament systems agree well with\nthe strongest trends observed at the Apollo 11 and\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n50\n\n12 landing sites. Small-scale lineaments are noticeably less well developed at the Apollo 14 site,\nwhich may be due to the presence of a relatively\nthick, 15- to 20-m fragmental debris layer. Long\nindividual lineaments ranging to 100 m or more\nare present.\n\nThree general types of patterned ground are\napparent at the Fra Mauro landing site as observed from the surface photography:\n( 1 ) A wikspread northwest-trending texture\ndiscussed by the crew during their pre-EVA\ndescription. (This type of patterning is impossible\nto map as individual lineaments but is a distinct\nimpression on the regolith surface.)\n\n(2) Isolated, intermediate-scale (a few meters\nmaximum) lineaments that are mappable and consist of either shallow greoves or small alined\ncraterlets, or both\n\n(3) Unusually long (up to 100 m or more),\nstraight, well-defined linear scarps and chains of\nsmall craterlets indicating, respectively, (a) relatively recent, minute vertical displacement and\n(b) possible sifting of fine-grained material down\nactive fractures into a more coherent, jointed, substrate at depth\nAll types of lineaments appear to vary in abundance along the Apollo 14 traverse route but, in\ngeneral, are more pronounced in photographic\npanoramas taken around the LM during the first\n\nFIGURE\n3-16.-Azimuth-frequency diagram of 49 lineaments in the Apollo 14 traverse area.\n\nEVA. The Sun angle was low (about 13O ) during\nthe first EVA and may have considerably enhanced lineament observability. Within the Cone\nCrater ejecta blanket, lineaments with amplitudes\nand wavelengths of a centimeter or less are poorly\ndeveloped and difficult to see, probably because of\nan abundance of fragments in this same size\nrange.\nThe regolith may not be sufficiently thin within\nthe Apollo 14 traverse area to permit welldeveloped small-scale lineaments. These were\nfound at the Apollo 12 site, however, in the thin,\nfirm regolith on the rim crests of old subdued\ncraters such as Surveyor and Middle Crescent\ncraters. Firm, compact soil was mentioned by the\nApollo 14 crew as being only between stations\nB1 and B2 (fig. 3-1). In pre-LM liftoff debriefing,\nit was mentioned that this firm ground was a small\nisolated patch in a generally powdery surface.\nA preliminary evaluation of regional scale\nlineaments around the Apollo 14 site has been\nreported.\' A reasonable correlation exists between\nthe local and regional linear trends (fig. 3-17).\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFIGURE\n3-15.-Azimuth-frequency diagram of 70 lineaments in the Apollo 14 traverse area.\n\n\'G.

Apollo 14 photographs contain a variety\nof fillets that can be studied with respect to the\nsizes, shapes, textures, orientations, and locations\nof rocks. It is evident that these factors influence\nthe development of fillets and that, in turn, fillets\nmay provide a decipherable record of lunarsurface erosion and deposition.\nDuring the second EVA, the crew described\nfillets at stations A, B, and C2. They photographed examples of these features with the\ncloseup stereocamera at station A and with\nHasselblad cameras at stations A, B2, C1, C2, at\nWeird Rock near station F, and at the boulder\nfield north of the LM at station H. l the boulders\nAl\nat these stations appear to be breccias or coarsely\nclastic rocks. The one nonflleted rock at White\nRocks has conspicuous light and dark layers.\nThe types of contacts between rock and soil\nare classified into three general categories based\non the attitude of the rock surface: low angle or\nshallow, steep, and overhanging (fig. 3-1 8).\nFillet characteristics for each of the major rocks\nradially outward from Cone Crater follow, beginning with the rocks in the White Rocks area.\n\nX\n\nFIGURE\n3-18.-Types of fillet contacts between rock, and\nsoil. (a) Shallow, with thin pockets of dust high on\nrock surface. (b) Steep, with concave fillet against\nbase of rock. (c) Overhanging, with little or no resulting fillet.\n\nWhite Rock. The White Rock (fig. 3-19) from\nwhich sample 14082 was taken is approximately\n1.5 m wide, has steep to overhanging sides, and a\npoorly developed fillet that L disturbed by soil\nfrom the LM pilot\xe2\x80\x99s (LMP)feet.\n\nSaddle Rock. The biggest of the White Rocks,\nSaddle Rock (fig. 3-20), is the largest block that\nwas observed closely. The southeast side reveals\n\n52\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nextensive burial or filleting at the base with a thin\ncoating of loose, fine, granular material extending\nwell up onto the more gently sloping surfaces. The\nfine and granular materials are darker than most\nof the fresh rock surfaces but are slightly lighter\nthan the dark clasts. Lineations on the dustcovered, finely fractured rock surface are not reflected in the lower fillet surface. Subangular\n\xe2\x82\xacragments several centimeters across are abundant\non the fillet surface. Some fragments are partially\nburied. A large, loose fragment is lying on the\nsouth slope of the block. The north side of the\nblock, toward Cone Crater, is not exposed, but\nthe east edge appears to drop off steeply as though\nthe north side were steep to overhanging, and less\nburial or filleting is evident.\n\nContact Rock. Contact Rock (fig. 3-21) at\nstation C1 is unusual in that it has no evident\n\nFIGURE\n3-20.-Closeup view of fillet on Saddle Rock.\n\nfillet but rather is in a depression with a raised\nrim. The visible sides of the rock are steep to\noverhanging, and the height-to-width ratio is 0.7,\nwhich is the highest of any of the large boulders\nstudied, further indicating that very little of it is\nburied. The lower white portion is angular, and\nthe upper darker portion is rounded. No obvious\nfine material occurs on the upper surfaces. Larger\nrocks surrounding the base are distinctly filleted\n\nFIGURE\n3-19.-Closeup\nstereophotograph of fillet on\nWhite Rock near station C1.\n\nFIGURE\n3-21.-Closeup\n\nview of fillet on Contact Rock.\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATIONS OF APOLLO 14 LANDING SITE\n\n53\n\nand the rounded ones several inches high are\nlargely blanketed by fine soil.

Filleted Rock (fig. 3-22) at\nstation C2 is 110 m south of the rim of Cone\nCrater. The rock is approximately 2 m long and\n1 m high and has a broad fillet extending toward\nthe camera and toward Cone Crater for approximately 3 m. The slope is gentle at this location,\nand a few lineaments or grooves trend roughly\nnorthwest-southeast.

It has a very\nclean upper surface and steep sides with a l-m-\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCUENCE REPORT\n\n54\n\nwide fillet against the southeast base. Three or\nfour rounded fragments several centimeters wide\nare partially exposed on the fillet surface. Big\nRock has a height-to-width ratio of 0.4, the lowest\nof the large rocks studied.\nWeird Rock. Weird Rock (fig. 3-24) is 700 m\nsoutheast of Cone Crater rim. In places, the edges\nslope steeply inward. Very thin filleting occurs on\nthe south and west sides, but the rock has a pronounced ridge of darker fines and fragments\ntrending about north-south against the eastern\nend that extends for several meters to the south\nand east. This thick fillet, as shown on more distant photographs, contains numerous small clasts\nand appears to be the margin of an ejecta blanket\nthat banked against the eastern side of Weird\nRock. A few patches of dark fine material are\nevident on the southward-sloping surface about\nmidway up the rock. The height-to-width ratio of\n\n0\n0\n-\n\n50\ncm\n\nFIGURE\n3-24.-Fillet\n\non Weird Rock near station F.\n\n0.65 is high, indicating that the rock may not be\nvery deeply buried.\nTurtle Rock. Turtle Rock (fig. 3-25) near\nstation H is well rounded and has a well-developed\nfillet extending more than a meter from the base.\nThe rock appears to be a coarse breccia. Two\nfragments were collected from the upper surface\nof the rock, and two were collected from the fillet.\nRock fragments encircle Turtle Rock beyond the\nintervening 10- or 20-cm band of the outward\nsloping fillet. Removal of samples from the top of\nthe rock showed the underlying surface to be\ndarker than the surrounding rock surface. This\ndark surface may be caused by trapped fines, or\nit may be a rough fracture surface that has not\nbeen exposed to lunar weathering.\nSloping Rock. Near station A, two closeup\nstereophotographs were taken of the contact between a fillet and a gently sloping rock surface.\nThe Sloping Rock and fillet are shown from approximately 15-m distance in Hasselblad photograph AS14-68-9409; the dark fillet trends about\neast-west on the light rock surface. A closeup\nphotograph of the contact of the fillet with the\ndusty boulder surface at the top is shown in figure\n3-26. Small, closely spaced linear depressions are\nobserved to cut across the contact in the clumpy\nfines. The fines are medium gray, very fine-grained\nwith clots up to 0.5 cm, and contain very sparse\nwhite particles, the color of the underlying rock.\n\nSummary. The size and shape of fillets around\nthe larger rocks in this area may be controlled by\nthe shape and friability of the host rocks. The\nmore rounded (and thus perhaps more friable)\nrocks with lower height-to-width ratios have bigger\nand more completely developed fillets. At the\nApollo 12 site (ref. 3-12), this type fillet is represented by the mounds, which are very friable\nand rounded and exhibit maximum fillet development. Rocks with gently sloping sides commonly\nhave more extensive fillets than rocks with steep\nsides. Most rocks with overhanging sides have few\nor no fillets developed on those exposures. The\nnonfilleted Contact Rock at station C1 is the best\nexample of this relationship; however, complete\nlack of a fillet on Contact Rock suggests that the\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATIONS OF APOLLO 14 LANDING SITE\n\n55\n\nrock was recently deposited in that position relative to the adjacent heavily filleted rocks. Conversely, Contact Rock may be harder than the\nother rocks in the area and therefore is not extensively eroded because of its high resistance.\nBoulders\n\nBoulders larger than 1-m diameter are abundant\nin the Cone Crater ejecta blanket and diminish in\nnumber farther away from the crater rim (fig.\n3-13). Boulders at the Fra Mauro site provide the\nfirst opportunity to study the geology of large\nlunar bedrock segments, although the boulders\nhave almost certainly been rotated from their\noriginal positions in the lunar bedrock.\nThe fragmental nature of all the boulders is\nevident in the photographs. Many clasts range in\nsize from 2 to 10 cm. The clastic appearance of\nthe rocks is somewhat similar to that of terrestrial\ndeposits of ejecta derived from impact events\n(fig. 3-27). Planar features are visible in all the\nboulders. In some, distinct lithologic layers are\nevident, whereas, in others, evidence for lithologic\ndifferences between layers is subtle or absent. The\nrocks also show one or more sets of welldeveloped, systematic planar fractures and a\nvariety of less systematic, mostly curved fractures.\nThe irregular shapes of the boulders are con-\n\nHorizon\n\n14319\n\'\n\\\n\n,\n\n\'..\n\n,The Turtle\n\n\'\'\n\n14312\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\ncm\n\nObscured\n\nby shadow\n\n- ,\n,\n\n0\n\n, , , , , ,\n\n,\n\n.5\n\n1\n\nm\nContour interval, 3 cm\nFIGURE\n3-25.-Fillet\n\non Turtle Rock at station H.\n\nFIGURE\n3-26.-Closeup photograph of fillet on Sloping\nRock.\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n56\n\nso-called zap pits) that are generally 1 cm or less\nin diameter.

For convenience, four rocks were named:\nWhite Rock, Saddle Rock, Layered Rock, and\nContact Rock.\n\nblocky shape, and consists of one apparent rock\ntype with a prominent dark clast at the east end.\nSample 14082, chipped from the top surface of\nWhite Rock by the LMP, was the only sample\nchipped from a boulder.\n\nPhotogeologic rock types were defined on the\nbasis of photographic tone and surface textures\nsuch as roughness and apparent erosional resistance. The overall twofold preliminary classification is based on the light-dark types shown in\nfigure 3-30. Thus, Saddle Rock is dominantly\nlight with dark patches, Layered Rock is the\ndarkest, Contact Rock is roughly half and half,\nand White Rock is dominantly light. The major\nrock types and their characteristics are summarized in table 3-1.\n\nSaddle Rock. Saddle Rock (fig. 3-20), at the\nnorth end of the White Rocks boulder field, is 4 5\n.\nm long from the north to the south end. The\ncrestline forms nearly a right angle pointing northwest which may reflect structural control. The\nirregular surface of the rock has dark hackly\npatches, resistant pinnacles, and a variety of lightto-dark clasts. Saddle Rock shows evidence of at\nleast five sets of planar surfaces. The most prominent surface, which is interpreted as layering, is\ninclined to the right and is expressed as a series of\nparallel indentations and discontinuous resistant\nribs. This set of surface controls the shape of the\neast face of the pinnacle, immediately south of the\nsaddle. The second most prominent set consists\nof subvertical fractures spaced a few centimeters\napart, trending about north-northeast. These are\nexpressed as closely spaced, near-vertical shadow\nlines on the short resistant ribs previously mentioned.\n\nThe rock types have been crosscut by a variety\nof planar surfaces including layering, well-defined\njoints, and closely spaced fractures. General patterns of these surfaces are shown in figures 3-28\nand 3-29.\nWhite Rock. White Rock (fig. 3-19) at the\neast side of White Rocks boulder field is 1.25 m\nlong oriented east-west. White Rock has a rather\n\nLayered Rock. Layered Rock (fig. 3-29), at\nthe west end of the White Rocks boulder field, is\napproximately 3 m long and 2 m high. It is characterized by a prominent west-dipping, lighttoned, clast-rich layer at the base overlain by a\nseries of dark, nearly vertical layers. The top appears to be a single clast approximately 1.7 m\nlong, which in turn consists of dark clastic fragments up to 40 cm long.\n\nFIGURE\n3-3O.-Light\nRocks.\n\nand dark differentiation of White\n\nContact Rock. Contact Rock at the south end\nof the field is approximately 3 m long. The most\nstriking feature is the irregular contact between\ndark rock above and light rock below (fig. 3-29).\nThs upper dark portion is rounded and knobby,\nand the lower portion is angular. The light layer\ncontains what appears to be fine fractures, or thin\nlayers, which are subparallel to the contact in the\nrock. Irregularities of the contact between layers\nare similar in appearance and scale to layers\nwithin the ejecta blanket of Meteor Crater,\nArizona (fig. 3-31).\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATIONS OF APOLLO 14 LANDING SITE\n\n59\n\nTABLE\n3-1.

Filleted Rock (fig. 3-22) at\nstation C2 is approximately 2 m wide at the base\nand 1 m high. The rock is roughly equant and in\ngross aspect has extensive, smooth, facetlike surfaces meeting in rounded corners. The surface is\nrough in detail, with abundant irregular angular\nprotuberances up to a few centimeters in size. The\nshadowed surface is distinctly mottled with irregularly shaped light-and-dark patches that\nappear to be clasts up to approximately 10 cm in\ndiameter surrounded by a generally dark material.\n\nThe light clasts, which appear to be granular, are\nat a scale of 1 cm or less. Sample 14053, a 7- by\n5- by 3-cm basaltic rock collected from the surface of Filleted Rock at station C2, is probably a\nclast from the boulder. The lenticular shape of the\nlight clasts imposes a weak, horizontally layered\nfabric on the shadowed surface. A few deep,\ncrudely linear shadows that dip about 50" to the\nleft (parallel to the surface of the sunlit face) may\nrepresent the traces on the shadowed face of a\nfracture system with 10- to 20-cm spacing.\n\n60\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nFIGURE 1.-Comparison of terrestrial and lunar contacts. (a) Quarry wall in fragmental\n3-3\ndebris ejected from Meteor Crater, Arizona. (b) Contact Rock at station C1.\n\nBig Rock. Big Rock (fig. 3-23) at station B2\nis approximately 1.5 m wide and 0.6 m high. Big\nRock is an irregular boulder with rounded protuberances and depressions with wavelengths and\namplitudes of approximately 10 to 30 cm. The\nrelatively planar top may be a fracture surface.\nFine light- and medium-gray mottling at 1-cm or\nfiner scale gives the surface a granular appearance\nthat is due in part to intricate pitting of the rock\nsurface and may be partially due to clasts of lightcolored rock in a medium-gray matrix. A distinctive structural grain on the rock surface is caused\nby a subparallel set of abundant, discontinuous,\nalternating light-and-dark bands that dip approximately 50" to the left with approximately 1-cm\nspacing. In places, the light-colored bands form\nridges; elsewhere, the relief is not evident and\nbanding may represent a true color variation\nrelated to compositional layering.\n\nWeird Rock. Weird Rock (fig. 3-24) near station F is approximately 2 m wide at the base and\n1.25 m high. It is roughly equant block with an\nirregular surface characterized by angular to\nrounded protuberances and depressions with amplitudes up to approximately 10 cm. Groups of\nsubparallel clefts and ridges on the rock surface\nreflect discontinuities or zones of weakness. The\nsurface is granular or mottled because of roughly\nequant to irregular light-gray clasts up to approxi-\n\nmately 10 cm in diameter. Much of the surface is\npitted. The pits are generally less than 1 cni in\ndiameter, and some have raised rims that are\nespecially evident in low-angle lighting. Some of\nthe apparent mottled texture may be a result of\nshadow distribution on pitted rock surfaces rather\nthan of lithologic differences within the rock.\nThree major sets of planar surfaces and at least\ntwo minor irregular sets are present. The most\nprominent of these is outlined by sharp, apparently horizontal clefts with 1- to 10-cm spacing\nin the lower part of Weird Rock. An irregular\nwhite layer, approximately 1 cm thick, resembles\na vein along the extension of a cleft in the righthand portion of the rock. The horizontal surfaces\ndo not transect but are terminated or are deflected\nby a semicircular mottled zone (perhaps a large\nclast) in the lower left-hand part of the rock. A\nsecond prominent set of surfaces similar to the\nfirst dips to the left intersects the first set at an\napparent angle of approximately 40", and is well\ndisplayed at the right-hand side of the block. The\nthird prominent set of surfaces occurs in the upper\npart of the rock and dips to the right at an apparent angle of 35". Surfaces in this set are less\nprominent and include many small ridges and\nfewer sharp depressions. Subtle tonal banding\nparallel to this set occurs in the upper part of the\nrock. The set may represent textural or compo-\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATIONS OF APOLLO 14 LANDING SITE\n\nsitional layering etched into low relief. Less\nprominent groups of surfaces, probably fractures,\ndip steeply to the right or form long, gently curving, nearly vertical clefts.\nTurtle Rock. Turtle Rock (fig. 3-25) is the\nlargest boulder in a field of rocks at station H. The\nboulder derives its name from the turtlelike feature on the upper surface. The LMP collected two\nloose-lying rocks (samples 14312 and 14319)\nfrom the upper surface of Turtle Rock and two\nchips (one identified as sample 14314) from the\nfillet adjacent to the boulder. The boulder is approximately 1.5 m wide and protrudes above the\nfillet approximately 0.75 m. The depth or northsouth dimension visible in lunar-surface photographs is 0.75 m.\n\nTurtle Rock contains abundant centimeter-size\nclasts, with a few up to 10 cm, in a nonresolvable\nmatrix. The clasts are dark gray to white. The\nlighter clasts commonly have dark rims. Most are\napproximately equant, but tubular, ellipsoidal,\nand contorted forms are common. Many of the\nwhite clasts are in depressions. The white wedgeshaped area may not be a clast but a concentration of white material that occurs along fracture\nplanes. Hundreds of zap pits are visible on the\nsurface of Turtle Rock. They range in diameter\nfrom a centimeter down to the limit of photographic resolution. Several circular depressions up\nto 4-cm-diameter sizes are probable impact pits.\nOne of these, with a large spa11 zone, is indicated\nin the lower center of the rock (fig. 3-25). The\nshape of the rock is controlled largely by fracturing. The most prominent structural feature is the\napparent layering that dips toward the lower right\nin the photograph. Several platy, angular fragments lying on the surface of the rock have broken\naway from these southeast-dipping layers. The\nlayering may be due to a combination of mineral\nbanding, as seen in the central and left side of\nthe rock, and fracturing, best seen below and to\nthe right of the wedge-shaped white area. In the\ncentral area of the rock, the bands are deformed\ninto lenticular and highly contorted shapes outlined sharply by a dark layer up to several millimeters thick. Many of the layers converge and are\nsimilar in appearance to crossbedding. Closely\n\n61\n\nspaced, parallel planar features trend northwest\nand dip steeply northeastward. The planes are\nspaced a few millimeters to a centimeter apart\nand are marked by barely discernible white lines\nin the photographs. Some of the white lines are\nbordered by equally thin dark lines on both sides.\nThese fractures cut across clasts and other fractures. A third set of fractures occurs in the lower\nleft-hand corner of the rock. These fractures dip\nnorthward, perhaps 40" to 50\xc2\xb0, and are spaced\n5 mm to 2 cm apart. These fractures are visible\nonly where etched into relief.\nSpZit Rock. At station C\', a large boulder (fig.\n3-32) has broken into two large pieces. This\nwell-rounded boulder, along with others in the\nstrewn field, was probably ejected from Cone\nCrater. The edges of the fracture that separates\nthe boulder pieces are sharp.

The samples include 35\nrocks that weigh more than 50 g each and approximately 30 smaller. rocks that weigh from 10 to\n50 g each, as well as numerous rock chips and\nfines collected with the scoop. Four core tubes of\nfines were collected, two of which were driven\ntogether as a double core. Sample locations in\ntables 3-11 and 3-111 are keyed to the traverse\nmaps (fig. 3-33). The samples are listed by\ntraverse stations where collected (table 3-11).\nSample locations are keyed to a consecutive listing of Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL)\nsample numbers in table 3-111.\nThe location of samples is established by relating returned samples to the documentary sample\nbags, lunar-surface photographs, and Apollo 14\ncrew descriptions that pertain to the given samples.\nLunar orientations of rock samples are also determined from lunar-surface photographs. Location\nand orientation are established with various\ndegrees of confidence, from the case in which both\nare accurately known to the case in which neither\nis known.\n\n9472,\n9415.\n9474\n9478.\n9479\n\n0\n\nboulder is similar to that of most of the other\nboulders on the Cone Crater ejecta blanket. This\nrounding probably occurred after the boulder\nwas ejected from the crater. The sharpness of the\nfracture, however, suggests that the fracture is\nrelatively recent and occurred long after the\nboulder assumed the present rounded form. This\ntype fracture is probably caused by meteorite\nimpact and should contribute significantly to the\nerosion of rocks by exposing larger surface areas\nto micrometeorite bombardment.\n\nN\n\nt\n\nFIGURE 3.

Three of these samples\n(14041, 14042, and 14045) are the largest fragments from a fractured clod that broke apart when\ncollected by the LMP. Sixteen additional rocks\nweighing more than 50 g are listed in groups I1\nand 111. Locations are known or suggested for\nthese rocks, but the rocks have not yet been\nprecisely oriented. (These 16 rocks are samples\n14049, 14053, 14055, 14063, 14064, 14066,\n14082, 14264, 14265, 14267, 14271, 14307,\n14308, 14310, 14311, and 14320; orientations of\nthese rocks are not known because of the lack of\nlunar-surface photographs or because of the smallsized images in the photographs. Exposure and\nburial surfaces are known, however, for samples\n14053, 14082, and 14310, based on weathering\ncharacteristics.) Samples 14264, 14265, 14267,\nand 14271 were collected in the comprehensive\nsample. Samples 14308 and 14311 broke apart\nafter sampling. Samples 14169 and 14303 are the\nonly rocks weighing more than 50 g for which\nlocations within the traverse area are considered\nto be very tentative.\nSample 14303. Sample 14303 is the largest rock\nfor which a location has not been reasonably well\nestablished from photography or crew comments.\nIt was returned in the same weigh bag (1027)\nwith the first EVA football-size rocks (samples\n14304 and 14305) collected by the CDR who was\nprobably carrying weigh bag 1027 at the time.\nThis weigh bag also included samples 14165 to\n14189, of uncertain location. By association, it\nappears likely that all these samples were collected\nduring the first EVA, although some repacking of\nbags was done at the end of the second EVA to\nalleviate sample-storage problems. After gathering\nthe comprehensive sample, the CDR reported\npicking up two small football-size rocks, both\n\nphotographed by stereopairs before collection and\nboth recognized from the photographs as samples\n14304 and 14305 (including sample 14302 before\nbreaking). The comprehensive sample is the most\nreasonable place in which to include samples\n14303 and 14165 to 14189. The LMP may have\njust picked up sample 14303 when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHey,\nhere-don\xe2\x80\x99t close it, here is one in here for that\n. . . one in here I picked up,\xe2\x80\x9d and put it into the\nCDRs weigh bag.\nSample 14047. Sample 14047 was collected at\nstation B from the west rim of a sharp 5-mdiameter crater during the second EVA. It is a\npoorly indurated clod that was located on a gently\nsloping and moderately undulating area. Sample\n14047 is approximately 10 cm long and is one of\nthe few rocks this size seen in the stereopair\n(AS14-64-9073 and AS14-64-9074), although\nthe panorama taken at station B shows many rocks\nand boulders larger than 10 cm in the general\n\nFIGURE\n3-34.Sample 14047 before collection.\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATIONS OF APOLLO 14 LANDING SITE\n\nBuried\n\n\\s-71-\\\n\n6-0\n\nFIGURE\n3-35.4rthogonal views of sample 14047 in\napproximate lunar orientation.\n\n75\n\nimmediate vicinity. The lunar-surface orientation\nof the sample is shown in figures 3-34 and 3-35.\nIt should be noted that the glass-covered surface\nwas buried at the time the sample was collected.\nSample 14051. Sample 14051, a rock approximately 7 cm long, was collected at station C\' on\nthe southeast slope of Cone Crater. The sample\nwas located on a fairly flat but gently undulating\narea heavily strewn with rocks and boulders.\nRocks in the area range in size from a centimeter\nto boulders several meters long. Most appear to\nbe partially buried and most are subangular to\nrounded. Sample 14051 was only slightly buried.\nThe lunar-surface orientation is shown in figures\n3-36 and 3-37.\nSample 14053. Sample 14053 was collected\nfrom the side of a large filleted boulder at station\nC2 (photographs AS14-64-9130 to AS14-649133). The sample, which has not been recognized in the photographs, is a crystalline rock that\nthe CDR picked from the eastern, weathered surface of the boulder. The sample is heavily pitted\non several faces but appears to be freshly broken\non what must have been the part embedded or\nlying on the rock. Numerous, fairly coarse, light\nand dark clasts are visible in the shadowed portion of the filleted boulder. Sample 14053 is\nprobably a clast weathered from the boulder.

Sample 14305 is\nthe second of the two small football-size rocks\nphotographed and collected during the k s t EVA.\nA small part of the rock that broke off sometime\nbetween stowage on the lunar surface and unpacking in the LRL was numbered 14302 in the\nLRL. Before sampling, the combined rock was\non a very gently undulating surface similar to that\nwhere sample 14304 was situated. An area approximately 1 m around the rock was mapped\n(fig. 3-40) from a stereopair of photographs\ntaken with the Hasselblad camera (AS14-679392 and AS14-67-9393). Sample 14305 is the\nlargest rock in the immediate area. This sample\nis approximately 15 cm across, whereas the next\n\nviewc: nf uamnle 34053\n\ncomplete orthogonal view of sample 14053 is\nshown in figure 3-38.\nSamples 14068 to 14072. Samples 14068 to\n14072 are documented small samples, all less than\n50 g in weight, that were collected at station C\xe2\x80\x99.\nIn the presampling photograph (AS14-64-9126),\nthe fragments appear to lie on the surface, between\nthe MET tracks, at the northeast side of an 8- or\n10-cm-diameter crater. This may be what the\nCDR referred to as a \xe2\x80\x9csecondary impact that\ndisrupted the surface\xe2\x80\x9d and had penetrated the\nlighter gray material below. The small fragments\nresemble one another and may be pieces of a\nlarger fragment broken by a low-energy impact.\nProbable correlations of the samples on the lunar\nsurface (AS14-64-9 126) with LRL photographs\nare shown in figure 3-39.\nSample 14082. Sample 14082 is an example of\nthe so-called White Rocks. The sample was apparently chipped from a 1-m boulder at station\nC1. Other boulders in the immediate vicinity are\nas much as 10 m across. The boulder from which\nthe sample was chipped is a fragmental rock with\nI-cm dark-and-light clasts set in a very light-gray\nmatrix. One indistinct subrounded dark clast is\n\nFIGURE\n3-39.Samples 14068 to 14072 and sample\n14144 before collection.\n\n77\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATIONS OF APOLLO 14 LANDING SITE\n\nby the rock rather than banked against the rock.\nThe freshness of the crater formed by the rock\nand the angularity of the crater edges suggest that\nthe rock has been in this position on the lunar\nsurface for a relatively short period of time. It is\nhighly probable that this rock landed in the present position as a result of a recent impact that\nforined a nearby crater, not as a result of the\nformation of any of the large older craters in the\narea such as Doublet, Triplet, or Cone. The lunarsurface orientation of rock 14305 is shown in\nfigure 3-41 and 3-42.\nSample 14306. Sample 14306 was collected at\nstation G, 70 m east of the moderately subdued\n\nFIGURE3-40.Sample 14305 (includes 14302 before\nbreakage) before collection; also shown in approximate lunar orientation reconstructed in the LRL using\noblique lighting.\n14305,,\n\nlargest rock seen in the photographs is approximately 4 cm in diameter.\nSample 14305 lies on the northern edge of a\nsmall, sharp, irregular depression. This depression\nappears to have been formed by impact of rock\n14305, the lower southwest edge of the rock\nhaving formed the major part of the depression.\nThe vertical southwest edge of the rock appears\nto have formed the northeast-trending grooved\npart of the depression by the sliding of the rock to\nthe northeast. A small fillet approximately 1 cm\ndeep is present against the southeast edge of the\nrock as though the rock dug into the fine-grained\nsurface material as it slid into the present position.\nThe fillet partially fills the northwest side of two\n3-cm raindrop-type craterlets, which indicates\nthat the fillet material moved in a direction away\nfrom the rock rather than toward the rock; such\nwould be the case if the material were pushed out\n\ne\n\n0\n\n,.-\'\n0\n\n-\n\n,~14302\n\nExplanation\nRock fragment o r clump\n\n;\n14302\n,-14305\n\nFiII-in\n\n\'\n\n,\n\nFillet\nSharp crater with raised r i m\nSubdued crater\nRaindrop depression\nShallow trough or lineament\nShadow cast by rock fragment\n\nFIGURE\n3-41.-Photograph,\nsketch map, and diagrammatic sketch of impact trajectory of sample 14305.\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n78\n\n,-\n\nI\n\n? ,\nI I\n\nI If)\n\ncrn\n\nBro\'ken\nface\n\n--;\\ ~\n\'\n\nFIGURE\n3-42.-Orthogonal\nviews of sample 14305 in\napproximate lunar orientation.\n\nNorth Triplet Crater. The surface in the immediate vicinity of sample 14306 is very gently undulating with subdued craters ranging from a few\ncentimeters to 2 m in diameter. Other rocks or\nclods ranging from the limit of resolution of the\nphotographs to 10 cm in the longest dimension\nare common but not abundant. One rock approximately 60 cm in the longest dimension lies\nabout 50 cm south of sample 14306. The rock has\na poorly developed fillet approximately 0.5 cm\nhigh against the two visible sides. The larger rock\njust south of rock 14306 has a well-developed\nfillet 2 to 3 cm high and appears to have a small\namount of fine-grained material contained in a\nfracture on the east side; all visible surfaces of\nrock 14306 appear to be free of fine-grained loose\nmaterial. The orientation of rock 14306 on the\nlunar surface is shown in figures 3-43 and 3-44.\nThe rock is notable because it has a glass-filled\n2-mm-wide fracture that cuts cleanly across one\nside (fig. 3-45).\nSample 14313. Sample 14313 was collected at\nstation G1 on the north rim of North Triplet\nCrater. The rock has an unusual L-shape and lay\non the lunar surface in the orientation shown in\nfigures 3-46 and 3-47. Other rocks or clods from\n6 to 10 cm across are moderately abundant on\nthe surrounding regolith.\n\nFIGURE3-43.Sample 14306, showing approximate\nlunar orientation reconstructed in the LRL using\noblique lighting.\n\nBuried .\n.\n\nI\n\nu\ncm 6\n\n0\n\nFIGURE\n3-44.4rthogonal views of sample 14306, shown\nin approximate lunar orientation.\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATIONS OF APOLLO 14 LANDING SITE\n\nFIGURE - 4 5 . 4 a m p l e 14306 showing prominent glass3\nfilled fracture.\n\n79\n\nSample 14318. Sample 14318 is identified as\ncoming from the south end of the north boulder\nfield, station H, and is the largest of the four\nlabeled rocks shown in the foreground of photographs AS14-68-9468 to AS14-68-9471 (fig.\n3-48). Four more samples were taken from\nTurtle Rock (fig. 3-49). Sample 14318 is a\ndifferent type of breccia from that represented by\nsample 14321 (shown later in fig. 3-52). Very\nlight-gray and light-to-medium gray clasts are set\nin a darker fine-grained matrix (fig. 3-50). One\nfracture surface that extends into the rock is\npartially coated with vesicular glass.

By far, most of the returned samples\nare fragmental rocks (table 3-IV) . Several different types are present and these are described in\ndetail in section 5 of this report. Some of the\nfragmental rocks are friable and others are more\ncoherent. Among the more coherent fragmental\nrocks, some can be seen in LRL photographs and\nby direct examination in the LRL to be composed\nmostly of dark, dense clasts in a lighter colored\nmatrix; others consist of a mixture of light- and\nmedium-gray clasts in a dark-gray matrix with\nlight clasts predominating in most examples. Both\ntypes of coherent breccias were collected from\nwidely separated points in the area traversed by\nthe Apollo 14 crew.\nComparison of the samples with the boulders\nshown in many of the surface photographs indi-\n\n82\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nclasts were less abundant in the returned samples\nthan dark-clast-rich breccias. It is not yet known\nwhether both types of coherent breccias are representative of the Fra Mauro Formation. I they\nf\nare, they indicate considerable lateral or vertical\nvariation within that unit. An alternative interpretation is that the coherent breccias with abundant light clasts represent a unit underlying the\nFra Mauro Formation that was excavated from\ndepth by Cone Crater and earlier large impacts.\n\nFIGURE\n3-55.-Sample\n\n14321 showing dark clasts and\n\nlighter matrix.\n\ncates numerous similarities. Closely spaced fractures are conspicuous in many of the coherent\nbreccias returned to Earth, and the shape of many\nof these rocks has been controlled by the fracture\nsets. Some returned rocks contain two or more sets\nof intersecting fractures. Similar fracture sets are\nprominent in all the large boulders appearing in\nthe surface photographs. Both light and dark\nclasts, some as long as 50 cm, are recognizable\nin all the boulders. Dark, dense clasts are espe\ncially prominent in boulders at the White Rocks\narea at station C1. Because of lack of resolution,\nit is not possible to identify the boulders as either\nof the two types of coherent breccia just described.\nHowever, many of the boulders have a rough\nhackly appearance that is more typical of the darkclast-rich breccias than it is of those breccias in\nwhich light clasts are predominant. In addition,\none sample of dark-clast-rich breccia (14321)\nwas described by the LM crew as typical of most\nboulders in the block field on the rim of Cone\nCrater. Overall, more samples of breccia with dark\nclasts in a light matrix were returned than were\nsamples in which light clasts predominate. It is,\ntherefore, inferred that dark-clast-rich breccia is\nthe dominant rock type in the block field surrounding Cone Crater, including the raylike extension\nwest as far as the north boulder field.\nBreccias with a dark-gray matrix in which relatively light clasts are more abundant than darker\n\nConclusions\nThe Apollo 14 LM landed on an area of lunar\nterra in what premission studies indicated was part\nof the ejecta blanket deposited during the formation of the Imbrium Basin. This material has been\nnamed the Fra Mauro Formation. The following\nconclusions derived from premission studies set\nthe geologic context in which the results of the\nmission can be placed.\n(1) The Fra Mauro Formation is older than\nany mare material on the Moon, including that\nat the Apollo 11 and 12 landing sites.\n(2) Craters in the 400-m to 1-km size range\nare two to three times more abundant in the Fra\nMauro region than in the mare material of the\nApollo 11 and 12 landing sites.\n( 3 ) Consistent with this more intense cratering\nhistory, the regolith in the Fra Mauro region is\nsignificantly thicker than that on the mare material.\n(4) The eastern part of the site, including the\narea of a relatively young, 340-m-diameter crater\nnamed Cone Crater, contains one of a family of\nnorth-south trending ridges that are characteristic\nof the Fra Mauro Formation. The western part is\nmuch more level except for superposed craters.\nThe possibility exists that the materials forming\nthe bedrock of the ridge and level areas may differ.\n( 5 ) Much of the eastern part of the landing\nsite is covered with the rubbly ejecta blanket of\nCone Crater. The rubble in this ejecta blanket was\nexcavated from beneath the thick regolith by the\nimpact that formed Cone Crater.\nGeologic analysis of the mission and LRL\nphotography, the voice transcript of the mission,\nthe crew debriefings, and the observation of returned samples by members of the Geology Experiment Team led to the following conclusions\nconcerning the geology of the landing site.\n\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATIONS OF APOLLO 14 LANDING SITE\n\nThe site is densely covered with craters in a l\nl\nstages of destruction. Some craters as much as\n400 m across have undergone nearly complete\ndestruction, and the overlapping of relatively\nlarge, very gentle depressions gives the topography at the site a strongly undulating aspect. In\ncontrast, the largest craters that have undergone\nnearly complete destruction at the Apollo 11 and\n12 landing sites are on the order of 50 to 100 m\nin diameter.\nThe lunar regolith at Fra Mauro is obviously\nthicker than at the mare sites, although estimates\nof the thickness are still preliminary. The surface\nmaterial is finer grained in the western portion of\nthe site away from the Cone Crater ejecta blanket\nthan in the continuous ejecta blanket itself. Rock\nfragments larger than a few centimeters across are\nrare in the western part of the site and become\nprogressively more abundant toward Cone Crater.\nThe regolith appears to be looser and less cohesive than that developed on the mare material;\ndownslope movement of this loose debris has\ncaused the eradication of small craters on slopes\nand extensive slumping of crater walls.\nBoulders up to 15 m across are present on the\nrim of Cone Crater; photographs of these boulders\nprovide the first dramatic glimpse of relatively\nlarge segments derived from lunar bedrock and of\ndetailed rock structures. Smaller boulders occur\nthroughout the Cone Crater ejecta blanket and as\nisolated occurrences on raylike extensions of the\nejecta blanket.\nAll the boulders for which stereophotographs\nare available appear to be coherent breccias, some\nwith discrete clasts up to 150 cm across, larger\nthan any of the returned samples. Both light and\ndark clasts are recognizable. Resistance of the\nbreccias to the weathering effects of the lunar\nenvironment varies considerably; some breccias\nhave weathered to smooth, resistant surfaces and\nothers to hackly, rough surfaces that may be\nrubbly.\nSignificant and striking features within the\nboulders are sets of parallel fractures spaced at\nseveral millimeters to approximately 1 cm. Several\nintersecting sets of differently spaced fractures are\npresent in some boulders.\nPortions of some boulders close to the rim of\nCone Crater are crudely layered with very light\n\n83\n\nmaterial that forms irregular bands from 25 to 40\ncm thick. The light bands contain both lighter\nand darker clasts up to 10 cm across, and the host\nrock of the bands contains light clasts up to 10 cm\nacross. Irregular parts of other boulders are also\nvery light, but a layered relationship is not evident. Boulders containing light layers occur only\nnear the rim of Cone Crater and hence may come\nfrom deeper levels in the crater.\nMost of the large blocks have fillets of lunar\nfines and fragments embanked against the basal\nedges. The size of a fillet is commonly proportional to the size, degree of rounding, and apparent\nfriability of the host rock. Fillets are preferentially developed against outward-sloping rock surfaces and contain coarse fragments spalled off the\nhost rock. Burial of rocks is a combined product\nof ( 1 ) ejecta blanketing by adjacent impact events\nof all sizes, particularly on well-rounded rocks the\ntops of which are close to the ground, and (2)\nself-burial by micrometeorite and thermal erosion\nof the exposed rock surfaces.\nTwo well-developed sets of surface lineaments\nhave the northwest and northeast trends observed\nat the Apollo 11 and 12 sites. A secondary set\ntrends north. The large number of very long,\nstraight lineaments is unique to the Apollo 14\nsite. These may be the result of very small, recent,\nvertical displacements along fractures, or sifting\nof fine-grained material down into fractures that\nwere propagated to the surface from a more coherent jointed substrate.\nThe returned lunar samples consist dominantly\nof fragmental rocks that vary significantly in the\ndegree of toughness and in the proportions and\ncharacter of included fragments. Any attempts to\nreconstruct the bedrock geology of the site from\nan analysis of the distribution of the various rock\ntypes must take into account the intense cratering\nhistory that the area has undergone and must\nrecognize that cratering events both comminute\nexisting bedrock and form new rocklike material\nfrom previously comminuted debris. Several tentative conclusions regarding the relationship of the\nsamples to the local geology may be stated as\nfollows.\n( 1 ) Moderately well-indurated breccia, in\nwhich the dominant clasts are dark and are set\nin a lighter matrix, is present throughout the\n\n84\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\ntraverse area and may be the dominant rock type\nin the Cone Crater ejecta blanket. Material of this\ntype occurs in raylike extensions of the ejecta field\nas far west as the north boulder field (station H)\nSome fragments of this material have been ejected\nto the surface more recently than the Cone Crater\nevent. Because of its relative abundance, it seems\nprobable that material of this type is representative of the Fra Mauro Formation.\n( 2 ) Another type of coherent breccia different\nfrom that discussed in the preceding paragraph\nwas returned in lesser amounts from the lunar surface. This type breccia consists of a mixture of\nlight, and dark clasts in nearly equal amounts in\na tough, coherent, gray matrix. This breccia type\nwas collected at points throughout the traverse\nincluding the north boulder field. It is either another part of the Fra Mauro Formation, indicating\nconsiderable vertical or horizontal differences in\nthat unit, or it may represent rocks that underlie\nthe Fra Mauro Formation and were excavated by\nCone Crater and older impacts.\n(3) The boulders reveal a complex sequence\nof events, not all of which can be related to the\nCone Crater event. Lithologically different layers\nwithin the boulders appear to change strike and\ndip radically over short distances within single\nboulders, indicating deformation of the layers.\nAlthough the rocks are heterogeneous breccias,\nthey have become sufficiently coherent to sustain\nplanar fractures that cross matrices and clasts\nalike. Some such fractures, as shown by returned\nsamples, have vesicular glass linings. The youngest structures, the glass-lined fractures, are the\nbest candidates to represent the Cone Crater event,\nbut they were preceded by the formation of\nlithologic layering, deformation, and induration.\nThese earlier events may be related to the emplacement of the Fra Mauro Formation as well\nas to pre-Fra Mauro events in the early history of\nthe Moon.\n(4) Some clasts within breccias are themselves\nfragmental rocks, and these may be the product\nof impact events that predate emplacement of the\nFra Mauro Formation.\n\n3-2.\n\n3-3.\n\n3-4.\n\n3-5.\n3-6.\n\n3-7.\n\n3-8.\n\n3-9.\n\n3-10\n\n3-11.\n\n3-12.\n\nReferences\n3-1.\n\nEGGLETON, E.: Preliminary Geology of the\nR.\nRiphaeus Quadrangle of the Moon and Defini-\n\ntion of the Fra Mauro Formation.

The in situ characteristics of the unconsolidated lunar-surface materials\ncan provide an invaluable record of the past influences of time, stress, and environment on the\nMoon. Of particular importance are such characteristics as particle size, particle shape, and\nparticle-size distribution, density, strength, and\ncompressibility.\nThe soil mechanics experiment relies heavily on\nobservational data such as are provided by photography, astronaut commentary, and examination\nof returned lunar samples. Quantitative data\nsources are limited; however, semiquantitative\nanalyses are possible, as shown in reference 4-1\nfor Apollo 11 and in reference 4-2 for Apollo 12.\nUniversity of California at Berkeley.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology.\ne NASA Manned Spacecraft Center.\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center.\ne California Institute of Technology.\n!Principal investigator.\na\n\nSuch analyses are strengthened through terrestrial simulation studies \' (ref. 4-3).\nThe results of the Apollo 11 and 12 missions\nhave generally confirmed the lunar-surface soil\nmodel developed by Scott and Roberson (ref.\n4-4); that is, the lunar soil is a predominantly\nsilty fine sand, is generally gray-brown in color,\nand exhibits a slight cohesion. Evidence of both\ncompressible and incompressible deformation has\nbeen observed. The lunar soil erodes under the\naction of the lunar module (LM) descent-engine\nexhaust during lunar landing, kicks up easily\nunder foot, and tends to adhere to most objects\nwith which it comes into contact. The value (or\nrange in values) of the in situ bulk density of the\nlunar soil remains uncertain, although Apollo 11\nand 12 core tube data and core tube simulations\'\ngive a best estimate of 1.7 to 1.9 g/cm3. Limited\ndirect evidence before the Apollo 14 mission suggested that some increase in soil strength and\ndensity occurs with depth beneath the lunar\nsurf ace.\nObservations at five Surveyor landing sites and\nthe two previous Apollo landing sites indicate\nrelatively little variation in surface soil conditions\nwith location.

The crew\ncovered a much greater distance during the extravehicular activity (EVA) than in previous missions, and the Fra Mauro landing site represented\na topographically and geologically different region\nof the Moon. In addition, three features of particular interest to the soil mechanics experiment\nwere new to the Apollo 14 mission-the Apollo\nsimple penetrometer (ASP) , the soil mechanics\ntrench, and the MET. Each of these has been used\nto shed new light on lunar soil characteristics, and\neach is discussed in detail in this section.\nAlthough the analyses and results presented in\nthis report are still preliminary in nature, certain\nconclusions are already apparent.\n(1) At the Apollo 14 landing site, a greater\nvariation in soil characteristics exists laterally and\nwithin the upper few tens of centimeters than had\nbeen previously encountered.\n(2) Although the lunar-surface material (uniform gray, fine silty sand) appears and behaves\nabout the same at all locations, much coarser material (medium- to coarse-sand size) may be\nencountered at depths of only a few centimeters.\n( 3 ) Core tube penetrations, measurements with\nthe ASP, and analyses of the interaction between\nthe MET and the lunar surface have been useful\nfor estimating soil properties and, in conjunction\nwith the observations at the soil mechanics trench,\nfor establishing that the lunar-surface soil strength\nincreases with depth.\n(4) In this report, as in previous reports, the\nlunar soil properties have been derived from estimates of penetration and force. The variation of\nsoil properties indicated by the Apollo 14 mission\nreinforces the need for more quantitative and\ndefinitive measurements.\nDescent and Landing\n\nThe Apollo 14 LM descended more steeply\nin the final stages of lunar approach than did the\nApollo 1I and 12 spacecraft, although the descent\nprofile was similar to that of Apollo 12 (ref. 4-2).\n\n\'Loss of visibility\n\n---Touchdown ooint\n\n\'.Apollo\n\n5\n\n10\n\n11\n15\n\nUprange distance, m\n\nFIGURE\n4-1.-A\ncomparison of the final-approach profiles of the Apollo 11, 12, and 14 LMs.\n\nA comparison of the final-approach profiles of all\nthree spacecraft is presented in figure 4-1.\nThe final stage of the Apollo 14 descent proceeded from a pause of approximately 20 sec at\nan altitude of approximately 55 m above the lunar\nsurface, while the spacecraft moved westward approximately 120 m until it was almost above\nNorth Triplet Crater. The altitude then decreased\nto approximately 30 m in the next 30 sec, as the\nLM continued another 120 m westward. The final\napproach of 35 sec took place at almost a 45"\nangle to the lunar surface. When the footpad\nprobes made contact, the spacecraft was moving\nslightly west of north, according to the marks\nmade on the surface by the probes (fig. 4-2). The\nlanding was soft, and the astronauts reported little\nor no stroking of the shock absorbers. Approximately 2 sec after footpad touchdown, the descent\nengine was shut down. When the spacecraft came\nto rest, the + Z leg (on which the ladder is\nmounted) was oriented approximately west 16"\nnorth, and the spacecraft was tipped forward in\nthis direction (pitch) approximately 2". At right\nangles to this direction, the LM was tilted down to\nthe north, or in the Y direction (roll), approximately 7".\n\n+\n\nSOIL MECHANICS EXPERIMENT\n\nFIGURE\n4-2.Position of +Y footpad embedded in the\nrim of a 2-m-diameter crater. The track of the contact\nprobe on the surface appears somewhat east of south\n(AS14-66-9258).\n\nThe astronauts commented that blowing dust\nwas first observed at an altitude of approximately\n33 m and that the quantity of dust from that\naltitude down to the surface seemed less than had\nbeen encountered during the Apollo 1 1 and 12\nlandings. The dust apparently caused no visibility\ndifficulties for the Apollo 14 crew. The Sun angle\nat landing was higher for the Apollo 14 mission\nthan it had been for the Apollo 12 landing. A\ncomparison of the descent motion pictures confirms the astronaut observations, in that the appearance of the blowing lunar-surface material\nduring the Apollo 14 descent seems qualitatively\nsimilar to that observed during the Apollo 11\nlanding. Dust was first observed at altitudes of\n24, 33, and 33 m for the Apollo 11, 12, and 14\nlandings, respectively. These observations occurred 65, 52, and 44 sec before touchdown,\nrespectively. Because of the effect of Sun angle\nand spacecraft orientation, however, the appearance of the dust in the motion pictures may not\nbe a reliable indication of the quantity of material\nremoved.\nAfter the landing, the astronauts reported that\nthe lunar surface gave evidence of the greatest\n\n89\n\nerosion in an area approximately 1 m southeast\nof the region below the engine nozzle. They noted\nthat as much as 10 cm of surface material may\nhave been removed during the landing. A distinct\nerosional pattern is visible in figure 4-3, which\nshows the area below the descent-engine nozzle.\nExcept for a disturbed area in the left middle distance, the surface gives the appearance of having\nbeen swept by engine gases in the same way as\nhad occurred on previous missions. The disturbed\narea may have developed as a consequence of a\ngrazing contact of the +Y footpad contact probe\nduring the landing. It was noted in a previous\nreport (ref. 4-1) that such a disturbance to the\nlunar surface breaks up the surface material and\nrenders it more susceptible to engine-exhaust\nerosion.\nIn the Apollo 14 descent motion pictures, it is\nevident that the lunar surface remains indistinct\nfor a number of seconds after descent-engine shutdown. This event was probably caused by venting\nfrom the soil of the exhaust gas stored in the voids\nof the lunar material during the final stages of\ndescent. The outflowing gas carries with it fine\nsoil particles that obscure the surface.\n\nFIGURE4-3 .-Area\nbelow the descent-engine nozzle\nshowing erosional features caused by the exhaust gas.\nThe -Y footpad can be seen in the distance (AS1466-9262).\n\n90\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nSome of the tilting of the spacecraft can be explained by an examination of the footpads. The\n-Y (fig. 4-3) and -2 footpads have penetrated\nthe surface only to a depth of 2 to 4 cm, whereas\nthe +Y (fig. 4-2) and + Z footpads have penetrated to a depth of 15 to 20 cm. The +Y footpad penetration mechanism is clearly visible in\nfigure 4-4; the footpad contacted and plowed into\nthe rim of a 2-m-diameter crater. The motion of\nthe footpad through the soil caused a buildup of\na mound of soil on the north side of the pad. The\nheight of the mound is somewhat higher than the\nactual penetration depth of the footpad. The astronauts reported that the + Z footpad, which is in\nthe shadow of the LM, also landed on the rim of\na small crater and exhibited appearance and penetration characteristics similar to the appearance\nand penetration characteristics of the +Y footpad. The mechanical properties of the soil, which\nare inferred from the response of the soil to the\nlanding (which occurred with little or no shockabsorber stroking) and from the appearance of\nthe soil in the footpad photographs, appear to be\nsimilar to the mechanical properties of the lunar\nmaterial on which the Apollo 11 and 12 LM\'s\nlanded.\n\nFIGURE- 4 . T h e +Y footpad embedded in the lunar\n4\nsoil. The gold foil surrounding the landing leg is probably the protective wrapping on the MET ( A S 1 4\n66-9234).\n\nThe penetration of the + Z and +Y footpads\ncaused 1" to 1.5" of LM tilting in the westerly\nand northerly directions. Consequently, at the\nlanding site, the strike of the lunar-surface slope is\napproximately west 16" north, and the dip is\napproximately 5.5" in the direction north 16"\neast.\nExtravehicular Activities\nGeneral Observations\n\nThe behavior of the surface soil, as observed\nduring the two EVA periods, was in many respects\nsimilar to that observed during earlier missions.\nThe soil could be kicked up easily during walking\nbut would also compress underfoot. Footprints\nranged in depth from 1 to 2 cm on level ground to\n10 cm on the rims of fresh, small craters. The\nMET tracks averaged 2 cm and ranged up to 8 cm\nin depth. Soil conditions evidently had less influence on the mobility of the astronauts and the\nMET than did the topography.\nPatterned ground ("raindrop" pattern) was\nfairly general, except near the top of Cone Crater.\nThe factors responsible for the development of this\nsurface texture are not yet known, although the\ntexture is probably related to the impact of small\nparticles on the lunar surface.\nAs has been observed during previous missions,\ndisturbed areas appear darker than undisturbed\nareas as may be seen in the background of figure\n4-5. Smoothed and compressed areas (e.g., MET\ntracks and astronauts\' footprints) are brighter at\nsome Sun angles, as shown in figure 4-6. In some\ninstances, it was difficult for the astronauts to distinguish between small, dust-covered rocks and\nclumps or clods of soil. The tops of many of the\nlarge rocks were free of dust, although fillets of\nsoil were common around the bottom. The astronauts commented that the major part of most large\nrocks appeared to be buried beneath the surrounding lunar surface. They also noted no obvious\nevidence of natural soil-slope failure on crater\nwalls.\nAdhesive and Cohesive Behavior\n\nAs on previous missions, dust was kicked up\nby walking. Objects brought into contact with the\n\n91\n\nSOIL MECHANICS EXPERIMENT\n\nFIGURE\n4-5.-The\nMET tracks in the immediate vicinity\nof the LM. The track depth in the soft spots in the\nforeground and along the rim of the small crater in\nthe background should be noted (AS14-66-9325).\n\nFIGURE\n&&-The\nMET tracks on relatively level, firm\nsoil in the vicinity of station B during EVA-2 (AS1464-9058).\n\nlunar surface or with flying dust tended to become\ncoated, although the layer generally remained\nthin. The astronauts reported that the MET\n\nsprayed dust around; however, thick layers did not\nform on any of the component parts, and no\n\xe2\x80\x9crooster tail\xe2\x80\x9d dust plume was noted behind the\nMET wheels.\nAlthough dust adhered readily to the astronauts\xe2\x80\x99\nsuits, it could be brushed off easily, except for that\npart that had been \xe2\x80\x9crubbed in\xe2\x80\x9d the fabric.\nSimilarly, dust sprinkled onto the thermal degradation sample (TDS) array was easily brushed off,\nalthough that portion of the dust that filled in\nthe number depressions of the TDS tended to\ncohere, as may be seen in figure 4-7. In this case,\nthe dust has been formed into the pattern of the\nnumbers shown; then, when the TDS was tapped,\nthe dust remained intact and bounced out of the\ndepression.\nAdhering dust caused some difficulty during\ndeployment of the suprathermal ion detector experiment and the lunar portable magnetometer.\nOverall, however, dust appears to have been much\nless of a problem during the Apollo 14 mission\nthan during previous missions. Although it is\npossible that the dust at the Fra Mauro site is, in\nfact, less adhesive, it should be noted that greater\nprecautions were taken to minimize dust prob-\n\nFIGURE\n4-7.-The\nTDS array after lunar soil had been\nsprinkled on it; blocks 9 to 12 are visible. The array\nwas moved slightly just before this photograph was\ntaken, and the soil filling some of the inset numbers\nhas jiggled out, while still retaining the shape of the\nnumbers (AS 14-77-10367 )\n\n.\n\n92\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nlems on this mission. The crewmen brushed each\nother off before ingressing the LM, thereby lessening housekeeping difficulties on the return trip.\nThat the surface soil at the Fra Mauro site\npossesses a small cohesion is demonstrated in\nseveral ways:\n( 1) Clumping of soil in the vicinity of the LM\nfootpads and elsewhere\n( 2 ) The numbers formed by dust on the TDS\narray\n( 3 ) The behavior of soil in astronaut footprints\nand MET tracks-the deformed shapes would not\nbe retained by a soil without cohesiveness.\nEvidence exists, however, that at least in some\nareas the cohesion is less than would be anticipated from the results of previous missions. In\nparticular, a sample fell out of the single core tube\n(tube 2043) near Cone Crater, and the soil\nmechanics trench caved in at a considerably\nshallower depth than had been anticipated. As\nnoted subsequently, the soil at relatively shallow\ndepth (a few centimeters) is coarser than at the\nsurface in some areas.\nThe source of lunar soil cohesion has not yet\nbeen determined; however, several sources are\npossibilities (e.g., primary valence bonding between freshly cleaved surfaces, electrostatic attraction, and bonding through adsorbed layers). In\nany case, it would be reasonable to expect that\ndifferent minerals probably have different cohesion, that different-sized particles of the same\nmineral have different cohesion, and that soils of\ndiffering sizes contain different minerals. As one\nillustration, study of the Surveyor 3 soil mechanics\nsurface sampler that was returned by the Apollo\n12 crew has shown that small glass spheres found\nin the lunar soil adhered better to painted surfaces\nthan angular fragments.\nIf a single mineral type and a fixed particle\nshape are considered, then increased cohesion\nwith decreasing particle size can be accounted\nfor in terms of increased numbers of interparticle\ncontacts per unit volume. Such an interpretation,\nhowever, would require the assumption that the\nattractive force per contact is essentially independent of particle size or normal force at the\ncontact. More detailed study of lunar soil cohesion is planned.\n\nEvaluafion of Lunar Soil Mechanical Properties\nFrom MET-Track Data\n\nThe MET (fig. 4-8) is a two-wheeled, rickshatype vehicle equipped with pneumatic tires. The\nMET was used to carry instruments, geological\ntools, and photographic equipment during both\nperiods of EVA. The maximum weight of the\nvehicle and the payload in lunar gravity was 128\nN (28.9 lb) including a maximum payload weight\nof rock and soil samples of 38.7 N (8.7 lb)\n(lunar gravity). During the second EVA, the\nMET traversed a distance of approximately 2.8\nkm, as shown in the geologic traverse map (fig.\n3-1, sec. 3). During this traverse, the total weight\nof the MET and the payload fluctuated between\n89 and 120 N depending on the amount of sample\ncollected.\nThe crew reported that the MET performed\nvery satisfactorily. It was more stable than had\nbeen expected and could traverse the surface over\na range of speeds without loss of control. No appreciable soil adhesion was noticed on the MET\ntires or other structural components, and only a\nlittle sideways spraying or ejection of fine-grained\nmaterial was observed while the MET was pulled\nalong the surface. The only difficulty encountered\n\nFIGURE\n4-8.-The\n\n68-9404).\n\nMET during the second EVA (AS14-\n\n93\n\nSOIL MECHANICS EXPERIMENT\n\nin pulling the MET developed while attempting\nto climb relatively steep grades. This difficulty was\nevidently not one of inadequate soil traction. Near\nCone Crater, it was easier for both astronauts to\ncarry the MET than for one of them to pull it\nuphill alone. As it rolled on level surface or downhill at relatively high speeds, the MET bounced;\nhowever, bouncing on the Moon was less than\nthat observed on Earth in 1/6g simulation tests.\nThe MET tracks at various locations along the\ngeologic traverse can be seen in figures 4-5, 4-6,\nand 4-9. The astronauts estimated the track\ndepths to vary between 0.5 and 2 cm and noted\nthat the largest sinkages occurred around soft\ncrater rims. A closeup photograph of a MET\ntrack in the immediate vicinity of station A is\nshown in figure 4-10. The estimated track depth\nat this location is 1.0 cm.\nThe facts that (1) the MET was equipped with\npneumatic tires of known geometry and loaddeflection characteristics, (2) the lunar soil at the\nApollo 14 site is predominantly granular, with a\nlarge percentage of grains in the sand-size range,\nand ( 3 ) the soil possesses only little cohesion\nrender MET-track data amenable to the dimen-\n\nFIGURE\n4-10.-The\nMET has evidently rolled across\nslightly firmer soil, because the track is narrower than\nbefore, which indicates less sinkage. In addition, there\nhas been considerably less tendency for the soil to\nadhere to the tire, although fine cracks cross the track\ntransverse to the direction of motion. A small white\nrock has been pushed into the soil by the MET tire in\nthe upper left-hand corner of the photograph. The indention at the upper right-hand corner of the photograph was probably produced by the edge of the camera while it was being positioned (AS14-77-10358).\n\nsional analysis developed by Freitag (ref. 4-5)\nthat relates to the performance of pneumatic tires\non soft granular soils. Accordingly, if the assumption is made that the functional relationships\ndescribing the tire-soil interaction under lunar environmental conditions and low velocities are essentially the same as the relationships describing\nthe corresponding tire-soil interaction on Earth,\nthe normalized sinkage z / d , in which z is the\npenetration depth of the tire and d is the tire\ndiameter, is related to the dimensionless quantity\nNSM =\n\nFIGURE\n4-9.-The\nMET tracks at station C\'.

The results of this analysis are presented in table 4-1. If,\n\nat the scale of the MET wheels, it is assumed that\ncohesion of the lunar soil is negligible, then the G\nvalues for the lunar soil would vary in direct proportion to the gravity level. With this assumption,\nG values for the lunar soil under terrestrial-gravity\nE\nconditions were computed (designated as G in\ntable 4-1).\nThe gradation of the lunar soil at the Apollo 14\nlanding site appears to be similar to that of an LSS\nused at the US.

The former solution would be considered\nthe more applicable to the present case. The values\nof friction angle using the shallow-cone theory are\nsignificantly higher than those estimated previously (ref. 4-4) for soil at the lunar surface. It\nmay be noted that the relationship developed by\nFreitag (ref. 4-5), which relates sinkage number\nto sand-mobility number, was derived for cohesionless soils. It would be expected for a soil of\ngiven friction angle and some cohesion that sinkage would be less than for the same soil without\ncohesion. As a consequence, estimated values of\nsand-mobility number would be too high, with the\nresult that estimates of density and friction angle\nwould also be too high.\nValues of friction angle (by using triaxial compression tests) were found (ref. 4-8) for an LSS\nto be on the order of 37" for a void ratio corresponding to the density values estimated from the\nMET tracks. With a modified LSS, which was\ndeveloped on the basis of grain-size distributions\nfrom Apollo 11 and 12 samples, Mitchell et al.\n(ref. 4-3) report friction angles of up to 48" from\nthe results of plane-strain tests.\n\n68-cm-long aluminum shaft, which is 0.95 cm in\ndiameter and has a 30" cone tip (apex angle) on\none end and a connection for the extension\nhandle on the other end.

After completion of these tests, the device was used to anchor the geophone cable when\nthe cable was placed in position for the active\nseismic experiment. The location of the three\npenetration tests was at a site approximately 8 m\nsouth of the ALSEP (fig. 3-28, sec. 3). After\nconnecting the ASP to the extension handle, the\nLM pilot (LMP) first pushed the ASP into the\nlunar soil as far as possible with one hand, called\nout the penetration depth, and then pushed it\ndeeper with both hands. This procedure was repeated twice more at points located approximately\n4 m apart.\nA photograph of the ASP is shown in figure\n4-11.

I this were the case for the ASP measuref\nments, then a significant portion of the applied\nforce would have been carried by shaft friction.\nHowever, the value of F , has also been investigated by laboratory simulations and has been\nfound to be negligible compared with the uncertainty associated with the forces exerted by the\nastronaut. Thus, in the following analysis, values\nhave been determined two ways; that is, (1)\nF, = 0 and (2) f J ( F , / A ) = 0.3 percent, where\nA is penetrometer cross-sectional area.\nThe strength properties of lunar soil have so\nfar been determined quantitatively only by means\nof the soil mechanics surface sampler experiment\non Surveyors 3 and 7.

Still, the penetrometer\ntheory can be used to gain some insight into the\nshear-strength parameters of the in situ soil at the\nApollo 14 landing site.\nThe bearing capacity of the ASP is given by\n\nwhere N , and N p are functions of (p, and g is the\nacce eration of gravity.\nA unique set of values of (p and c cannot be\nobtained from this equation, because there are\ntwo unknowns. However, for each value of (p,\nthere is only one value of c, and a curve of (b as\na function of c can be calculated.

The band for the ASP parameters, if no\nskin friction is assumed, falls above and to the\nright of the Surveyor parameters, which implies\nthat the values of the soil-strength parameters at\nthe Apollo 14 landing site may be greater than\nthose at the two Surveyor sites. However, if friction is a significant factor, then the parameter\nvalues at the different landing sites may be approximately the same. The former assumption is\nnot unreasonable, however, because the Surveyor\ndata are from surface tests, and the ASP data\nare from subsurface tests. The lunar soil strength\nprobably increases generally with depth.\nThe variation of unit penetration resistance with\ndepth in the lunar soil is probably very complex,\nas a result of layers and pockets in the soil with\nvarying bulk density, grain-size distribution, cohesion, etc. The self-recording penetrometer,\nplanned for use on the Apollo 15 and 16 missions,\n\nwill return continuous force versus depth readings.\nIt is anticipated that measured variations in penetration resistance with depth will indicate different soil depositional units. An infinite number of\npossible distributions of unit penetration resistance as a function of depth would fit the ASP\ndata obtained during the Apollo 14 mission, because only endpoint values are known, although\nthe LMP did indicate that penetration resistance\nincreases with depth. Three simple examples\nlabeled A (linear) and B (nonlinear) and C (bilinear) are shown in figure 4-14. These three examples demonstrate further that the data are\ninsufficiently sensitive to reveal lateral inhomogeneities among the three penetration sites.\nDetailed investigation of lateral inhomogeneity\nwill be performed on the data that are expected\nto be returned from the Apollo 15 and 16\nmissions.\nSoil Mechanics Trench\n\n+&I\n\nTest 3a\n\n60\n70\n\n806\n\no;\nlA0\nl;o\n40\n2\no\n;\n3bo\nUnit penetration resistance, HA, N / c ~ \'\n\nFIGURE\n4-14.-Penetration\nresistance as a function of\ndepth for the ASP.

The purposes of this excavation were ( 1) to expose the in situ stratigraphy,\n(2) to provide a means for estimation of soilstrength parameters by using stability analyses,\n(3) to provide additional data on soil texture and\nconsistency, (4) to enable sampling at depth, and\n(5) to determine the ease with which surface material can be excavated.\nThe site chosen for trenching was the western\nrim of a small crater approximately 6 m in diameter and 0.75 m deep. The lunar trenching tool\n(fig. 4-15) consisted of a 21.6-cm-long ( 8 . 5 in.)\nby 15.2-cm-wide (6 in.) blade oriented 90" to\na handle. The tool was used like a backhoe by\nthe CDR.\nThe trench site is shown before excavation i\nn\nfigure 4-16, where the edge of the small crater\nmay be seen in the left of the photograph. The\nCDR stood in this crater and faced west while\ndigging.

The GDR reported that\ndigging was easy and estimated his first cut to be\na depth of approximately 15 cm with sidewalls at\nan angle of 70" to 80". With the next cut, the\nwalls were steepened to 80" to 8 5 " , but, at that\npoint, they started caving in. It is not clear from\nthe various transcripts and debriefings just how\nsteep the walls remained overall; but it appears\nthat, for the remainder of the excavation, slopes\nsteeper than approximately 60" could not be\nmaintained.\nThe excavation passed through three distinct\nlayers. The upper 3 to 5 cm were dark brown and\nfine grained. Next, a very thin layer (0.5 cm thick\nor less) of black, glassy particles was encountered.\nBeneath this layer was a much lighter colored and\ncoarser grained material. This stratification is not\nreadily visible in figures 4-17 to 4-19; however,\nthe difference in grain size is marked (as seen by\nthe distribution curves for samples from the upper\nand lower layers in fig. 4-21).\nBased on previous estimates of lunar soil friction angle and cohesion at other sites, it was anticipated that trenching to a depth of 60 cm with\nnear-vertical sidewalls should be possible without\nf\ndifficulty.

These estimates are based on the\nknown dimensions of the gnomon and camera\nphotographs. (It should be noted in this regard\nthat the CDR stopped digging not because he\ncould not go deeper, but because the constant\ncrumbling of the trench walls made the retrieval\nof an uncontaminated sample from the trench\nbottom impossible.)\nCombinations of cohesion c, density y, slope\nheight H , slope angle p , and friction angle (p that\ncorrespond to incipient failure are shown in figure 4-23.

These values\nare only on the order of 10 percent of the values\nestimated using previous lunar-surface data. If\nthe higher values of friction angle (40" to 45")\ndeduced from the MET-track data are representative of the soil in the trench, then the values of\ncohesion required are even less. It should be\nnoted, however, that the computed values of cohesion are lower bound estimates; that is, they are\nthe minimum values required to maintain stability\nfor the conditions shown. Nonetheless, it does\nappear that the soil beneath the surface at the\nlocation of the Apollo 14 trench is less cohesive\nthan would have been anticipated on the basis of\nprevious data. This lower value for cohesion is\ncompatible with the cohesion of the coarser grain\nsizes encountered.\n\nSufficient data are not available at present to\ndetermine the probable variations in size versus\nfrequency distribution with depth. The soil\nmechanics trench provides a possible means of\ndetermining vertical variations in particle size at\nselected sites. The heat flow experiment on the\nApollo 15 mission should also provide such\ninformation, provided that excessive disturbance\ndoes not occur during the drilling operation.\nA computer program has been written to calculate the total area of influence of all particles\nlarge enough to interfere with a penetrating probe.\nThe influence area is given by the following\nequation\nz=n\n\n. .\n\n1=1,\n\nwhere\nA I =total influence area of all particles larger\nthan i,\ni, =smallest particle size that will stop penetration\nD i diameter of particle i\n=\nD, =diameter of the probe\nNi= number of particles in size range i (850\nsize ranges used to describe the Apollo\n\n104\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n12 size versus frequency distribution\ncurve)\nThe ratio of this influence area to the total\nsample area represents the probability of striking\na critical particle in a unit volume. The analysis\nis conducted to any desired depth and the cumulative probability of not encountering a critical\nobstructing particle is calculated.\nThe probability analysis was used to determine\nthe likelihood that the three ASP penetrations\ncould be made to the full depth of the instrument\n(68 cm) without encountering a rock equal to or\nlarger than the diameter of the instrument (0.95\ncm). The probability for the three events was\ncalculated to be 51 percent. (The probability of\na single ASP penetration not encountering a sizable obstruction is approximately 80 percent.)\nThe four core tube events were analyzed in a\nsimilar manner. The combined probability of the\nfour tubes being driven to their respective depths\nwithout encountering a particle equal to or greater\nthan the core tube diameter (1.95 cm) was 67\npercent. In actual fact, one of the core tubes (tube\n2022) hit an obstruction. The probability that\none or more core tubes would hit an obstruction\nwas only 33 percent.\nThis type of analysis using the size versus frequency distribution to predict and to interpret the\nsuccess of subsurface probings offers promise for\nfuture missions, which will include instrumented\npenetrometer experiments and the heat flow experiment with the associated lunar-surface drill.\nTo make the analysis more effective, an evaluation\nof the size versus frequency distribution should be\nmade at each landing site. In addition, detailed\nstudy of trenches and deep core samples may give\na more accurate model of the size versus frequency\ndistribution with depth.\nThe Apollo 11 and 12 size versus frequency\ndistribution curves were also used to predict the\nnumber of particles of a given size that should be\nfound in the soil mechanics trench. The results\nindicate that only a few particles larger than 1 cm\nwould have been expected in the excavated soil.\nHowever, the CDR reported many rocks in the 1to 2-cm range, and numerous particles of this size\ncan be observed in the photographs of the trench.\nFurthermore, the grain-size distributions deter-\n\nmined in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL)\nfor material from the bottom of the trench (fig.\n4-23) showed more than 20 percent of the sample\nto be coarser than 1 cm. This is strong evidence\nthat the particle size versus frequency distribution\ncounts made at the surface of the Apollo 11 and\n12 sites are not good indicators of the size distributions likely to occur with depth at other sites.\n\nLRL Observations\nMore than 13 kg of lunar soil were returned in\ntwo bags (inside the first sample return container)\nrepresenting the bulk and comprehensive samples.\nIn addition, two single and one double core tube\nsamples were obtained, as listed in table 4-111,\nand bag samples were returned from the soil\nmechanics trench and the material brought up but\nnot retained in a core tube driven in the vicinity\nof Cone Crater. Although laboratory study of\nthese samples is still in a preliminary stage, some\nobservations relative to the physical and mechanical characteristics of the lunar soil are possible.\nGeneral Characteristics\n\nThe soil from the Fra Mauro site is generally\nlighter in color than that at the Apollo 11 and 12\nsites (except for the very light sample from the\nApollo 12 site). The color is more brown than\nblack, probably because there is more plagioclase\nin the Apollo 14 soil than in earlier samples.\nMore variation in color exists from sample to\nsample than was observed in the samples from\nthe Apollo 11 and 12 sites. Thus far, a significant\nproportion of glass beads has not been found.\nThe Apollo 14 bulk sample appears to be less\ncohesive than the soil from previous Apollo sites,\neven after sieving through a 1-mm sieve to remove\nthe coarse fraction. Whether this lesser cohesion\nreflects a coarser grain-size distribution, different\ncomposition, or the effects of prolonged exposure\nto atmosphere is not yet known.\nGrain-Size Distribution\n\nGrain-size distributions thus far obtained are\nshown in figure 4-21.

It can be seen that the bulk\nsample, which is composed of surface and nearsurface material, and the surface layer from the\ntrench have particle sizes comparable to that of\nthe Apollo 12 samples. However, the material that\nfell out of the core tubes near Cone Crater and\nthe material from the lower layer of the trench are\nconsiderably coarser, although still somewhat finer\nthan the coarse layer found in the Apollo 12\ndouble core tube (ref. 4-1 1) . The granularity of\nthe sample from near Cone Crater could account\nfor the fact that it was not retained in the core\ntube.\n\n31.9\n\n1.75\n\nc\n\ndThis core tube was driven twice: First, on Cone\nCrater, where some or all of the sample fell out; and,\nsecond, at North Triplet Crater during the second attempt\nat a triple core, where some of the sample fell out.\n\nburred. In the second attempt, the LMP moved\napproximately 9 m north of the previous location\nto a site that appeared similar. Here, he was able\nto drive the tube (tube 2043, the same tube used\non Cone Crater) deeper than before (one and a\nhalf tubes), but he was still unable to achieve a\ntriple core. Furthermore, when the LMP was\ndisassembling the core tubes, part of the sample\n\nCore lube Samples\n\nIn terms of sample recovery and quality, the\nApollo 14 core tubes are poorer than those returned from the Apollo 12 mission. During the\nfirst part of the second EVA, the CDR obtained\na double core tube (tubes 2045 and 2044, table\n4-111) at station A (fig. 4-24). Near the rim of\nCone Crater at station C\xe2\x80\x99, his attempt to take a\nsingle core tube (tube 2043) in a rock-strewn\narea failed when the soil sample (some or all) fell\nout of the core tube. Later at Triplet Crater (station G), two attempts to recover a triple core\nsample were thwarted, and the crew had to settle\nfor two single core tube samples. In the first attempt, the LMP reported that he had struck rock\nand had been unable to penetrate deeper than one\ncore tube. Examination of the bit from this core\ntube (tube 2022) confirmed this, because the edge\nof the stainless-steel bit was visibly dented and\n\nFIGURE\n&24.-Double\n\ncere tube. The double core tube\nsample was taken at station A during the second EVA.\nThe tube was driven to a depth of 64 cm (1% core\ntube lengths) although when this photograph was taken,\nthe depth was 13 cm.

This value is significantly less than the value determined for the lower\nhalfaf the Apollo 12 double core (1.96 g/cm3).\nThis difference will be investigated further to determine if differences in the grain-size distribution\nor the specific gravity of the two soils (or both)\ncan be responsible. The tare weight of the core\ntube used in the calculation will also be checked.\n(2) The grain-size distribution for the sample\nfrom the bottom of the trench indicates a much\ncoarser soil at depth in the vicinity of Triplet\nCrater, where the two triple cores were attempted.\nThis coarser soil could account for the driving\ndifficulties encountered in that area.\n( 3 ) The sample from the second attempt with\na triple core tube (tube 2043) was severely disturbed. The angle between the tubes and the lunar\nsurface varied significantly in the course of the\ndriving, which reflects the LVP\'s efforts to drive\nit as deeply as possible. Not only did some of the\nsample fall out the back end of the tube, but some\nmay have fallen out the front end as well; furthermore, the sample that remained was not restrained\nfrom moving in the tube, because the Teflon\nfollower also fell out. Finally, the sample from\nCone Crater may also be mixed in with the sample\nfrom Triplet Crater, because this tube was used at\nboth locations.\n(4) The double core sample offers the best\ncharice for determining the original depth of the\nsamples in the lunar surface by means of the\nmethod developed by Carrier et al."\n( 5 ) Unfortunately, lunar-surface core tube\ndocumentation photography was incomplete for\ntwo of the four core tubes.

Thus, proper interpretation of the\ncore tube data is made difficult.\n( 6 ) Two core tubes (tubes 2023 and 2024)\nwere left on the Moon because the crew believed,\nprobably correctly, that they were empty. Had the\ntubes been returned, however, they would have\nbeen helpful in interpreting the sample in tube\n2043. For example, the presence of dust on the\nliner or the location of the Teflon follower inside\nthe tube might have been an indication of how\nmuch sample had entered the second core during\nthe second attempt at the triple core. (The sample\nfell out when the tubes were disconnected.)\n\nConclusions\nThe following conclusions are made for the\nApollo 14 mission on the basis of the observations\nand analyses completed thus far:\n(1) Although the surface texture and appearance at the Apollo 14 landing site are similar to\nthose at the Apollo 11 and 12 landing sites, a\ngreater variation exists in the characteristics of the\nsoil at shallow depths (a few centimeters) in both\nlateral and vertical directions than had previously\nbeen supposed. Soil with a particle-size distribution in the medium- to coarse-sand range may be\nencountered at shallow depths.\n(2) Blowing dust apparently caused less impairment of visibility during landing than on\nprevious missions.\n( 3 ) Evidence exists that venting from the soil\nvoid; of descent-engine exhaust gas after engine\nshutdown caused fine particle movement.\n(4) The mechanical properties of the soil, as\nexhibited by response to the LM landing, appear\nsimilar to those of the lunar material on which\nthe Apollo 11 and 12 spacecraft landed.\n( 5 ) Patterned ground (raindrop pattern) was\nfairly general, except near the top of Cone Crater.\n(6) As had been the case in previous missions,\ndust was easily kicked up and tended to adhere to\nany surface contacted; however, overall dust was\nless of a problem than on previous missions.\n(7) The soil at shallow depth is somewhat less\ncohesive than the soil observed in previous missions.\n( 8 ) Analysis of MET-track depths has indi-\n\n107\n\nSOIL MECHANICS EXPERIMENT\n\ncated a probable in-place density of 1.8 to 1.9\ng/cm3 and angles of internal friction in the range\nof 40" to 45" (if a cohesionless soil is assumed)\nfor soil near the surface. The MET-track observations show that the soil is less dense, more compressible, and weaker at the rims of small craters\nthan in level intercrater regions.\n(9) Values for cone index gradient G deducted\nfrom MET-track depths average 0.4 MN/mz/m\non soft crater rims and 1.0 MN/m"/m on level\nfirm terrain. These values are compatible with\nthose assumed for LRV studies but are significantly less than those corresponding to penetration depths of approximately 50 cm, as determined\nfrom ASP data.\n(10) The results of ASP measurements suggest that the soil in the vicinity of the Apollo 14\nALSEP may be somewhat stronger than soil at\nthe landing sites of Surveyor 3 and 7.\n(11) Comparison of the results of analysis\nusing ASP, MET-track, bootprint, and trench\ndata shows that soil strength increases with depth.\n(12) No difficulty was encountered in digging\na trench into the lunar surface. Because of unexpectedly low cohesion of the soil at the trench site,\nthe trench sidewalls caved in at somewhat smaller\ntrench depths than had been predicted.\n(13 ) The stratigraphy at the trench site showed\na dark, fine-grained material (to a depth of 3 to\n5 cm) that is underlain by a very thin glassy layer\nthat, in turn, is underlain by a material of mediumto coarse-sand gradation.\n(14) Computations of soil cohesion at depth\nat the trench site result in lower bound estimates\nconsiderably lower than expected (0.03 to 0.10\nkN/mz as opposed to 0.35 to 0.70 kN/m\').\n(15) Based on surface-particle size versus frequency distribution counts from the Apollo 11\nand 12 sites, the probability of the three ASP and\nfour core tube penetrations encountering obstmctionc were 51 percent and 33 percent, respectively.\n( 16) The surface-particle size versus frequency\ndistribution counts from the Apollo 11 and 12\nsites are not good indicators of the size distributions likely to occur with depth at other sites.\n(17) Preliminary observations in the LRL have\nshown that (a) soil from the Fra Mauro landing\nsite is generally lighter in color than at the Apollo\n\n11 and 12 landing sites, (b) the bulk sample is\nless cohesive than the soil obtained from previous\nApollo landing sites, and (c) core tube sample\nquality was poorer than that obtained from previous missions.\n(18) The calculated bulk density of the soil in\nthe lower half of the double core tube was 1.75\ng/cm". This density is comparable to the density\nestimated from MET-track data but is less than\nthat determined for the lower half of the Apollo\n12 double core tube sample.\n(19) The values for different soil properties\npresented in this report have been deduced from\nestimates of force and penetration. The variation\nin these values, as well as the uncertainties in the\nanalyses, reinforces the need for more quantitative\nand definitive measurements in subsequent missions. The self-recording penetrometer scheduled\nfor use on the Apollo 15 and 16 missions should\nbe an invaluable source of such quantitative soil\ndata.\nReferences\n4-1.\n\n4-2.\n\n4-3.\n\n4-4.\n\n4-5.\n\n4-6.\n\nCOSTES, C.; CARRIER, D.; MITCHELL, K.;\nN.\nW.\nJ.\nAND SCOTT,\nR.

Preliminary Examination of Lunar Samples\nThe Lunar Sample Preliminary Examination Team a\n\nThe surface of the Moon can be divided into\nthe dark mare areas and the bright highland\nregions. The mare regions cover approximately\none-third of the near side of the Moon and make\nup a small fraction of the far side. These mare\nareas are recognized as the areas of most recent\nwidespread rock formation on the lunar surface.\nThe first three groups of samples returned from\nthe Moon to Earth (i.e., the samples from the\nApollo 1 1 , Apollo 12, and Luna 16 missions) all\ncome from typical mare regions.\nDetailed chemical and petrographic studies of\nthe samples from the three widely separated mare\nregions show that the dark regions of the Moon\nare probably underlain by basaltic rocks, which\nare iron-rich and sodium-poor (relative to similar\nterrestrial rocks). Absolute ages determined for\nbasaltic rocks from the Apollo 1 1 and 12 sites\nand for crater densities on nearby mare surfaces\nsuggest that the final filling of most mare basins\ntook place between 3.0 and 4.0 billion yr ago.\nThe stratigraphic and petrographic studies of\nthe mare samples lead to two general inferences\nregarding the Moon-that the internal temperatures of at least parts of the Moon reached the\nmelting point of basalt less than 1 billion yr after\nthe formation of the Moon and that the evolution\nof most of the lunar surface took place very early\nin the history of the planet. Gilbert (ref. 5-1) and\nseveral other authors have suggested that one of\nthe last major events in the evolution of the premare lunar surface was the formation of the Mare\nImbrium Basin and the ejection of an extensive\nblanket of material from this basin by the Imbrian\nimpact. This blanket was named the \xe2\x80\x9cFra Mauro\nFormation\xe2\x80\x9d after a region north of the crater\n\nFra Mauro where a portion of the presumed ejecta\nblanket appears to protrude above the surrounding\nmare basalt flows (ref. 5-2). On February 5 and\n6, 1971, the Apollo 14 lunar-landing crew visited\na site approximately in the center of this island\nof premare material.\n\nFIGURE - 1 .

Relative to the breccias returned\nfrom the Apollo 1 1 and 12 sites, some of the rocks\nfrom the Apollo 14 site are lighter in color, more\nfriable, and contain fewer and smaller clasts; but\nmost are more coherent, contain less glass, and\nhave larger and more abundant clasts.

In\nrocks with intermediate degrees of crystallinity,\nsome ilmenite and plagioclase grains commonly\nexhibit crystal faces.\nAn attempt was made to classify the fragmental\nrocks on the basis of ( 1 ) coherence, (2) percentage of clasts greater than 1 mm in diameter, ( 3 )\ncolor of the lithic clasts, and (4) degree of matrix\n\nPRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF LUNAR SAMPLES\n\ncrystallinity. Limited thin-section study suggests\nthat the degree of crystallinity of the matrix will\nprove to be a significant parameter for classification when a more extensive microscopic survey of\nthe clastic rocks has been made. A working classification that is descriptive was developed on the\nbasis of hand specimen study. The fragmental\nrocks fall into three groups, each of which is represented by approximately one-third of the rocks.\nThe samples in the first group are those that\nhave friable matrices and contain approximately\n5 percent clasts greater than 1 mm, among which\nlithic clasts predominate. In more than half of\nthese rocks, light-colored clasts make up more\nthan 90 percent of the total clasts larger than\n1 mm; the remainder has less than 50 percent\ndark-colored clasts. Most of the clasts are themselves fragmental. Angular glass fragments and\nbroken and intact glass spheres, which are mostly\nmedium brown in color, are present. A number of\nthe group 1 samples bear the marks of the thin\naluminum foil used to wrap and protect them;\nthey crumble very easily and resemble weakly\nindurated soil.\nThe samples in the second group are characterized by light-colored clasts (in excess of darker\nclasts) and moderate coherency. The abundances\nof clasts are high, and nearly 80 percent of these\nrocks have more than 5 percent of their clasts\ngreater than 1 mm across. In approximately 60\npercent of these rocks, leucocratic clasts make up\nmore than 90 percent of the total lithic clasts.\nThere are some clasts of basdtic rock, some of a\nvery-fine-grained melanocratic rock, and a few\nmonomineralic granular olivine clasts.\nThe samples in the third group are characterized by dark-colored lithic clasts in excess of\nlight-colored clasts. Two subgroups of this group\nhave moderately coherent and coherent matrices.\nNinety percent of the rocks in this group have 5\npercent or more of their clasts greater than 1 mm\nacross. Most of the clasts are crystalline, aphanitic,\ndark-gray to black fragments with recrystallized\nmatrices. Basalt and \xe2\x80\x9cdunite\xe2\x80\x9d clasts are present in\nsome rocks.\nMost lithic clasts are equant, but some are\nelongate or tabular. Rounded clasts are common,\nalthough angular clasts predominate (fig. 5-4).\n\n113\n\nFIGURE\n5-4.Sample 14321 (the largest rock returned\nfrom the Apollo 14 landing site; 9.0 kg). The rock is\nfragmental with a medium-gray matrix and contains\nabundant dark fragmental clasts. One clast is 10 cm\nacross (S-71-22985).\n\nLithic clasts range in size from a few micrometers\nto 1 6 cm (sample 14321). The largest clast seen\nin lunar-surface photographs measures more than\n1 m across. Some of the larger clasts are rimmed\nby bands of matrix of finer median grain size and\ngenerally lighter color than that of the bulk matrix\nof the rock. Lithic clasts can be classified as frag-\n\nFIGURE\n5-5.-Photomicrograph\nof a thin section of sample 14304 in which a fragmental rock that contains a\nlarge clast with basaltic texture and many mineral and\nfragmental clasts is shown.

Most fragmental clasts\ncontain the same range of clast types as the host\nrock and are distinguishable only by differences in\nthe matrices. The degrees of crystallinity of the\nclasts are equal to or greater than that of the\nmatrix. Boundaries of clasts in a single rock may\nrange from sharp to diffuse, both of which types\nof boundaries may be found in the same rock. As\nmany as three generations of fragmental rocks\nwithin clasts ha% been observed.\nA short description of the nonfragmental lithic\nclasts in order of abundance follows:\n( 1) Clinopyroxene-plagioclase clasts with basaltic texture are common and generally contain\nminor amounts of ilmenite, metallic iron, and\ntroilite (fig. 5-5). Plagioclase grains commonly\nshow a fine mosaic; mosaicism in pyroxene is less\nabundant.\n(2) Feldspathic clasts, which consist principally of plagioclase with only minor amounts of\nother phases (pyroxene, olivine (possibly),\nilmenite, metallic iron, and zircon (possibly) ),\nare fairly abundant. Plagioclase grains are\ncommonly enclosed by a very-fine-grained feldspathic matrix. Many plagioclase grains are deformed, and fine plagioclase mosaics are not\n\nFIGURE\n5--6.-Photomicrograph\nof a thin section of sample 14301 in which a fragmental rock that contains\nabundant lithic clasts is shown. The large clast is an\nexample of the fine-grained granular feldspathic clasts.\nOther lithic clasts include a broken glass spherule and\na dark-matrix fragmental clast. The scale is 3.1 mm\nacres:!, the field of view (S-71-2.5490).\n\nuncommon. Some feldspar grains show no deformation and are composed of plagioclase with\na granulitic texture (fig. 5-6).\n( 3 ) Plagioclase-orthopyroxene clasts with subophitic texture contain intergrown plagioclase and\northopyroxene with minor clinopyroxene, ilmenite,\nand iron. Euhedral plagioclase is accompanied by\nanhedral pyroxene, and, in some cases, the orthopyroxene is poikilitic.\n(4) Olivine-glass clasts are rare and consist\nof skeletal olivine crystals in glass.\n( 5 ) Clasts consisting almost entirely of olivine\nwith a granulitic texture are present in some rocks.\n(6) Angular glass clasts and glass spheres are\npresent in those rocks that do not have a crystalline matrix. The glass varies in color, amount and\ntype of inclusions, and heterogeneity. Some glass\nclasts are apparently devitrified, and one type consists of relic angular plagioclase and pyroxene\ngrains in an extremely-fine-grained groundmass\nthat possibly contains skeletal olivine microlites.\nAll glass clasts in the recrystallized fragmental\nrocks are at least partially devitrified and contain needlelike crystals, possibly of feldspar.\nThe types and relative abundances of mineral\nclasts vary widely in the several fragmental rocks\nthat have been studied microscopically. These\nminerals are anorthitic plagioclase, clinopyroxene\n(augite and pigeonite), orthopyroxene, ilmenite,\nolivine, metallic iron, troilite, chromium spinel,\nulvospinel, native copper, Armalcolite, zircon,\napatite, potassium ( K ) feldspar (possibly) , and\nseveral unidentified phases. A pink, high-relief,\nisatropic mineral in several of the fragmental\nrocks may be garnet or spinel. The plagioclase-toclinopyroxene ratio ranges very roughly from 2 :1\nin many fragmental rocks to approximately 5: 1 in\nsome of the lighter colored fragmental rocks. A\nbrief description of the more abundant minerals\nfollows.\nPlagioclase occurs as single grains and commonly also as fine-grained mosaics that were\nprobably produced from single crystals. Some\nmaskelynite is present. A few clasts consist of an\nequigranular mosaic of plagioclase crystals. Clinopyroxene is abundant, with both pigeonite and\naugite represented. Some clinopyroxene grains are\nlarge and undeformed and contain fine, very regular exsolution lamellae of pyroxene; however,\n\nPRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF LUNAR SAMPLES\n\ndeformation and mosaic texture are common.\nOrthopyroxene, which may contain lamellae of\nclinopyroxene up to 5 pm wide, is commonly\nundeformed.\nOlivine occurs as angular single crystals, and a\nfew grains are subhedral. Some clasts up to 1 mm\nin diameter are an equigranular mosaic of olivine\ngrains. Several olivine clasts are rimmed by an\nintergrowth of pyroxene and ilmenite.\nIlmenite is the most abundant opaque mineral,\nalthough it is less abundant than in previously returned lunar material. Ilmenite commonly occurs\nas small angular to subrounded grains, and small\n(10-pm) laths occur in the fragmental rocks that\nshow some degree of crystallinity. A few large\n(up to 250 pm) subrounded grains occur; many\nof these show deformation twin lamellae.\nMetallic iron is widely dispersed throughout\nthe rocks and occurs in grains ranging from less\nthan 1 to 250 pm in diameter. The grains range\nin shape from rounded to ragged and are highly\nirregular. The abundance of metal is commonly\nless than that in Apollo 12 basaltic rocks. The\nassociation of metal with troilite is less pronounced\nthan in the Apollo 1 1 and 12 rocks.\nTroilite is less common than in the Apollo 11\nand 12 rocks and occurs as small rounded to\nangular grains that may contain inclusions of\nnative iron. Chromium spinel, ulvospinel, native\ncopper, and Armalcolite occur as angular grains\nin extremely minor amounts. Most of the mineral\nclasts are such as might be expected from comminution of the lithic fragments. However, the\nsparsely occurring single-mineral fragments of\nclinopyroxene and orthopyroxene with exsolution\nlamellae and fragments of larger olivine and ilmenite grains have not been seen in lithic clasts.\nMatrices of fragmental rocks vary in crystallinity (one extreme type contains abundant glass)\nand, in these matrices, the fragments range in\nsize to less than 1 pm. At the other extreme, some\nmatrices appear to be totally crystalline. In these,\nthe matrix consists of lath-shaped plagioclase,\nanhedral pyroxene, platelike ilmenite, and small\nmetal grains. The bulk of fragmental rocks appears to exhibit some degree of crystallinity, and\nthe examples with totally crystalline matrices\nwould be classed as crystalline rocks of fragmental\norigin.\n\n115\n\nSome of the fragmental rocks studied in thin\nsections contain dark-brown glass that occurs in\ntwo ways: as a filling material for the fractures\nand veins (up to 5 mm thick) that may crosscut\nmatrices and clasts, and as a coating material for\nsome clast surfaces. Most of the glass veins and\ncoatings contain mineral inclusions and spherules\nof metallic iron, and some of the veins and coatings are vesicular. The rocks tend to break along\nglass-filled fractures.\nHomogeneous Crystalline Rocks\n\nThe homogeneous crystalline rocks can be divided into two groups: those with basaltic textures\nand those that have very-fine-grained granulitic\ntextures. The only crystalline rocks with masses\ngreater than 50 g are samples 14053 and 14310.\nThese basaltic rocks have typical igneous textures\nand are composed principally of plagioclase,\nbrown and yellow-brown pyroxenes, olivine, and\nopaque minerals. These rocks differ from the\nbasaltic rocks returned from the Apollo 11 and 12\nsites in being much richer in plagioclase and\npoorer in ilmenite and in having much lighter\ncolored pyroxenes.\nThe basaltic rocks are fine and even grained,\nare aphyric, and have textures that range from\nintersertal to intergranular to ophitic. The grain\nsize ranges from fine to medium and is commonly\ncoarser than that of the homogeneous nonbasaltic\ncrystalline rocks. The basaltic rocks fall readily\ninto two subgroups: those with approximately 40\nto 45 percent plagioclase (samples 14053, 14071,\nand 14074) and those that have approximately\n60 to 70 percent plagioclase (samples 14073,\n14078, 14079, 14276, and 14310).\nSample 14310 is a fine-grained basaltic rock\nwith scattered small cognate inclusions that are\nfiner grained than the body of the rock (fig. 5-7).\nRock 14310 has an intergranular to intersertal\ntexture and consists of euhedral plagioclase laths\nand anhedral pyroxene crystals. Modal analyses\nindicate approximately 66 percent plagioclase, 3 1\npercent clinopyroxene, and lesser amounts of\nilmenite, troilite, metallic iron, chromium spinel,\nand ulvospinel. The mesostasis, which amounts to\na few volume percent, consists of complex finegrained material, including apatite (possibly) ;\n\n116\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nwith the mesostasis. The mesostasis is complex and\nincludes spongy masses of metallic iron, dendritic\nilmenite, fayalite (possibly) , and vermicular mixtures of colorless and black glasses.\n\nFIGURE\n5--7.-Photomicrograph of a thin section of sample 14310 in which the intergranular texture of the\nplagioclase and pigeonite and a cognate inclusion in\nthe lower right corner are shown. The scale is 3.1 mm\nacross the field of view (5-71-25551).\n\nilmenite; troilite, which contains metallic-iron\nblebs; possible alkali feldspar; an unidentified\norange-brown, transparent, isotropic mineral with\nhigh relief and a high index of refraction; and clear\nglass, which contains opaque to reddish-brown\nmaterial, possibly glass spherules. This sample is\nof special interest because the chemistry and\nmodal mineralogy differ from those of previously\ndescribed lunar basaltic rocks. Rock 14310 resembles some terrestrial high-alumina basalts in\nmajor-element content (see tables 5-IV and 5-V\nlater in this section), but highly calcic plagioclase\n(approximately Ans9) and a predominance of\npigeonite among the pyroxenes distinguish this\nrock from terrestrial high-alumina basalts.\nSample 14053 has an ophitic texture and is\ncoarser grained and more mafic than sample\n14310. The rock is moderately inhomogeneous and\nappears to be subtly layered, with modal plagioclase approximately 40 percent in one part and\napproximately 60 percent in the remainder. One\nthin section of this rock is composed of pyroxene\n(5 1 percent, mainly pigeonite), bytownitic or\nanorthitic plagioclase (41 percent), and a few\npercent olivine that is commonly present as anhedral grains in cores of pigeonite grains. Phases in\nminor abundance include metallic iron, ilmenite,\ntroilite, and ulvospinel with ilmenite lamellae\nalong octahedral planes. Cristobalite (approximately 2 percent) occurs in vugs and is associated\n\nThe fine-grained holocrystalline rocks are\ncommonly inequigranular and contain 1 to 5 percent of irregular large mineral grains, commonly\nplagioclase, but less commonly olivine or pyroxene. All but two rocks in this group are light\ncolored and consist principally of plagioclase and\nlight-gray pyroxene. The two dark rocks (samples\n14006 and 14440) are aphanitic, and the mineralogies are not yet known because no thin\nsections have been examined. Both the light and\nthe dark rock types appear to be common as\nclasts in the fragmental rocks. Lithologic similarity to clasts and the small size support the idea\nthat these rocks were once clasts in fragmental\nrocks. The paucity of dark rocks in this group is\nconsistent with the small percentage of friable,\neasily disaggregated breccias in which dark clasts\nare dominant.\nShock Metamorphism\n\nShock featires are best developed within individual clasts o\xe2\x80\x99f fragmental rocks and in soil particles and are iFrgely absent from basaltic rocks.\nWithin fragmenfal rocks, the evidence for shock\ndecreases with increasing crystallinity of the\nmatrix. As in previous sample returns, abundant\nevidence of multiple shock events exists. In fact,\nas many as threq generations of clasts within a\nfragmental rock may contain evidence of shock\nmetamorphism.\nWeak shock. Most lithic and mineral inclusions\nwithin the fragmental rocks are intensely fractured\nand shattered. Extreme mosaicism is common and\nis one of the most outstanding features in the\nfragmental rocks. No deformation structures unequivocally indicative of static- deformation were\nobserved. Thus, it is concluded that the abundant\nmosaicism is to a large extent, if not exclusively,\ncaused by weak shock effects below the Hugoniot\nelastic limit.\nModerate shock. Shock features indicative of\nsolid-state deformation are present in fragmental\nrocks and soils. These include planar features in\n\nPRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF LUNAR SAMPLES\n\nplagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine that are associated with a decrease in refractive index, pressure\ntwinning in plagioclase and pyroxene, and diaplectic feldspar glasses. Despite the high abundance of lithic and mineral clasts, however, these\nfeatures are as rare as they were in the Apollo 11\nand 12 materials.\nStrong shock. Shock-fusion products are present as heterogeneous schlieren-rich glass fragments and glass spheres, which in some cases\ncontain mineral relics. Some lithic clasts contain\nveins of shock-melted glass that contains numerous metallic spherules. In addition, glass spatter\nof various shapes and sizes was observed on the\nsurfaces of some rocks. Thus, as in samples returned from previous missions, widespread evidence exists of shock-induced fusion.\nRock Surface Feafures\n\nIn general, the surface features observed on\nApollo 14 rocks are similar to those reported for\nrock samples from previous missions (refs. 5-3\nand 5-4).\nMicrometeoroid impact craters are very\ncommon and are characterized by a central glasslined depression (pit) and a concentric area of\nconchoidal fractures (spall zone). Some exceptionally large pit craters (up to 5-mm pit diameter) were observed. Some friable rocks have\ncraters without glass-lined central pits and with\nno pronounced spall zone. The crater shapes are\ntypical for craters in slightly cohesive targets\n(ref. 5-5). The most friable rocks do not display\nany signs of cratering; such features may have\nbeen destroyed in transit.\nMelt droplets and small glass spatter of various\n\nshapes, sizes, and colors are common on rock\nsurfaces. Large glass coatings (1 to 3 cm2in area)\nare rare. When present, they seem to be thinner\nand much more vesicular than the spatter observed\non rocks returned from previous missions, and they\nrange from approximately 0.01 to 1 mm in thickness. In addition, glass fills fractures in some rocks\nand, in one case, metallic spatter (a few square\nmillimeters in area) was observed.\nA few rocks display planar surfaces (10 to 50\ncm\' in area) that are characterized by parallel\ngrooves a few millimeters apart and up to 1 mm\ndeep. These surfaces are otherwise free of relief\nand resemble slickensides. A soil line that separated a dust-covered bottom surface from a dustfree top surface was observed. Less cohesive fragmental rocks with a high percentage of lithic\ninclusions have hackly surfaces that are characteristic of clast molds. In general, the surface features\nobserved on the moderately cohesive and tough\nrocks are similar to the surface features reported\nfor rocks returned from previous missions.\nSoil\n\nSeven soil samples were returned from the\nApollo 14 site; data concerning six of these\nsamples are contained in table 5-111. The grainsize distributions for six of these samples are\nshown in figure 5-8. Four samples (samples\n14148, 14163, 14156, and 14259) have grain size\ndistributions similar to those of the Apollo 11 and\n12 soils, except that the soils from the Apollo 14\nsite are more poorly sorted. Two samples (14149\nand 14141) are coarser than any lunar soil\nsamples previously examined, with the exception\nof the coarse layer in the Apollo 12 double core\n(sample 12028).\n\nTABLE5-111.

In the fraction with grain sizes less than\n62.5 pm, the glass fragments are generally highly\nangular and colorless to pale green. With increasing grain size, dark-brown glass fragments, many\nof which appear to be agglutinates, are more\nabundant. Glass spheres are present, but are not\ncommon. Several examples of compound glass\nspheres (one glass sphere enclosing another) were\nobserved in samples 14148 and 14163.\nThe proportion of lithic fragments in the soils\nincreases with grain size and reaches 70 to 100\n\npercent in the 1- to 2-mm fraction. Lithic fragments include both fragmental and homogeneous\ncrystalline rocks. The fragmental rock particles\npredominate over the crystalline rock particles and,\nin some samples, crystalline rock fragments are\nabsent. The lithic fragments are similar (in modal\nvariability and range of types) to the lithic clasts\nthat were found in the fragmental rocks described\npreviously. Fragments of crystalline rocks compose approximately 40 percent of the 1- to 2-mm\nfraction sampled from the bottom of the trench.\nMost of these crystalline rocks are plagioclase-orthopyroxene rocks with subophitic textures. Clinopyroxene, opaque minerals (mostly ilmenite) , and\nmesostasis are also present.\nMineral fragments are most abundant in the 37to 62.5-pm fraction, consisting of angular grains\nof plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, and opaque\nminerals. The two most abundant minerals are\nplagioclase and clinopyroxene. The plagioclase-toclinopyroxene ratios range from 16: 1 to 1 : 2 ; the\nratio varies not only from sample to sample, but\n\nPRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF LUNAR SAMPLES\n\nfrom one size fraction to another. Olivine and\northopyroxene are the next most abundant minerals, and opaque minerals are least abundant. In\nterms of compositional range and deformational\nfeatures, all the minerals are similar to those described as mineral clasts in the fragmental rocks.\nThe Cone Crater soil sample (14141) is distinctly different from the other soils. As mentioned\npreviously, it is coarser grained (with a median\ngrain size of-approximately 0.74 mm), and the\nglass content is very low (less than 10 percent in\nthe 0.5-mm fractions). The Cone Crater soil\nsample contains a high content of fragmental-rock\nfragments (40 to 60 percent), even in the finest\nsize fractions (62.5 pm). The remainder of the\nmaterial is glass-bonded fragmental rock.\nCore Tube Samples\n\nFour core tube samples, which consist of a\ndouble and two single core tube samples, were\nreturned from the Fra Mauro site. None of the\ncore tubes has been opened for study, but stereo\nX-radiographs have been taken to determine the\nsample, quantity, texture, and layering, and the\namount of disturbance in each core.\nThe double core tube sample (39.5 cm \xe2\x82\xacong and\n209 g), which was collected at station A during\nthe second EVA, shows textural changes that may\nrepresent at least seven and possibly nine layers,\nwhich range from 1 to 13 cm thick. Overall, a\npronounced decrease in grain size occurs from the\nbottom to the top of the core. Near the base, 10\nto 15 percent of the rock fragments are greater\nthan 5 mm long, whereas, near the top, only a few\nparticles are larger than 2 mm. The largest rock\nfragment visible in the X-radiographs is 1.2 cm\nlong.\nA single core tube sample (16.5 cm long and\n81 g), which was collected at Triplet Crater,\nexhibits, on the basis of textural changes visible\nin the X-radiographs, at least three layers that\nrange from 0.5 to 5 cm thick. Ten to 20 percent\nof the soil appears to consist of fragments greater\nthan 2 mm long in a matrix of fine-sand- or coarsesilt-size particles. In this case, as in the double\ncore tube sample, a crude grading of particles\nlarger than 2 mm is seen from the base to the top\nof the core.\n\n119\n\nApproximately 15 percent of another single core\ntube sample (12.5 cm long and 71 g) collected at\nTriplet Crater consists of rock fragments greater\nthan 2 mm long in a fine-grained matrix. The\nsample is loose in the tube and is highly disturbed.\nSignificant variations in the mechanical behavior of the lunar soil were observed at the Fra\nMauro site compared with observations at previous\nApollo sites. A detailed discussion of the lunar soil\nmechanical properties can be found in section 4\nof this report.\nEmission Spectrographic Analysis\n\nChemical analyses of some samples were made\nby the use of three optical-emission spectrographic\nmethods: (1) a general method for the analysis\nof major and minor elements by the use of strontium (Sr) as the internal standard and the buffer;\n(2) a method for the detection of minor and trace\nelements by the use of palladium (Pd) as the\ninternal standard; and (3) a method for the determination of K, lithium (Li), rubidium (Rb),\nand cesium (Cs) by the use of sodium (Na) as\nthe internal standard and the buffer. The analytical methods used were similar to those used previously (refs. 5-3 and 5 - 4 ) . Usually, the method\nthat used a buffer system with burning conditions\nnearest the conditions of the element being measured was given the most consideration. The overall\nprecision of the determination is 2 5 to t10 percent of the amount present. Accuracy was controlled by the use of international rock-standard\nsamples (G-1, W-1, SY-1, BCR-1, AGV-1,\nGSP-1, PCC-1, and DTS-1) for calibration.\nAnother calibration sample that was added was\nlunar sample 10084, which is a homogeneous finegrained sample that was analyzed by many principal investigators.\nA total of 16 samples was analyzed. The weights\nof the samples used for analysis were typically\n100 to 150 mg. In most cases, to protect the\nintegrity of the rocks, the samples for analysis\nwere from chips in the same sample bag as the\nrocks or were chips that had fallen off the rock\nduring preliminary sample processing. The analyses presented may, therefore, not be representative of the whole rocks. Most of the rocks are\nheterogeneous and, thus, may have considerable\nvariations in composition.\n\n120\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCUENCE REPORT\n\nElement\n\n14053\n\n14321.14\n\nI /\n14049\n\nI4310\n\n14321.\n9\n\n14042\n\n.\n\n14301\n\nI4065\n\nElemental abundance. percent\n\nSi ............... 22.6\nAI ............... 6.4\nMg .............. 5.0\nFe ............... 12.6\nCa............... 8.5\nTi . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n9\nNa ................\n28\n12\nK .................\nMn . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n22\nGr . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30\n.\n\nI\n\n22.4\n7.4\n7.2\n10.1\n6.1\n1.4\n.30\n28\n-20\n.29\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n23.5\n10.6\n4.8\n6.0\n7.8\n8\n47\n\n22.9\n9.0\n6.6\n7.6\n6.4\n10\n.63\n44\n14\n13\n\n22.9\n9.0\n6.6\n7.6\n6.3\n10\n.58\n60\n.15\n12\n\n24.0\n8.5\n5.2\n7.4\n1.4\n1.1\n36\n.52\n12\n12\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n8.0\n5.7\n7.3\n7.1\n1.1\n42\n1.0\n.12\n09\n\n11.1\n5.0\n5.3\n8.5\n6\n68\n83\n09\n.07\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n-\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI4305\n\n14259\n\n.\n.\n\n23.5\n9.5\n6.6\n7.0\n5.8\n9\n42\n.46\n12\n11\n\n.\n.\n.44\n.11\n.11\n\n14066\n\n.\n\n.\n\n8.5\n7.8\n7.4\n5.3\n1.0\n.63\n1.0\n14\n.12\n\n.\n\n9.5\n5.5\n7.8\n7.8\n1.1\n38\n.42\n14\n14\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n(average)\nFines\n\n22.5\n9.3\n5.9\n8.0\n7.4\n1.1\n.42\n.43\n.15\n.14\n\n-\n\nElemental abundance. ppm\n\n.\n.\n\n.\n..\nBa ...............\nCo...............\n\nCu ...............\nLa...............\n\nLi ...............\nNi ...............\nNb ..............\nRb ...............\n\nsc...............\nSr ...............\nv ................\nYb ...............\nY ...............\nZr ...............\n\nI\n\n190\n48\n13\n10\n11\n14\n19\n2\n\n90\n180\n135\n10\n90\n310\n\nI\n\n380\n33\n13\n40\n18\n180\n22\n7\n43\n140\n85\n20\n160\n670\n\n670\n40\n16\n63\n20\n260\n52\n14\n25\n200\n48\n28\n220\n880\n\n630\n31\n11\n36\n19\n165\n43\n15\n20\n250\n35\n30\n180\n930\n\n820\n56\n19\n70\n19\n280\n68\n14\n30\n210\n74\n27\n110\n1030\n\n730\n32\n7\n65\n19\n240\n46\n14\n16\n180\n32\n28\n220\n860\n\n920\n\n960\n39\n7\n72\n25\n210\n60\n29\n24\n220\n52\n31\n250\n970\n\n820\n19\n6\n32\n20\n60\n57\n33\n16\n250\n46\n27\n200\n980\n\n44\n17\n92\n20\n230\n63\n17\n31\n240\n63\n33\n260\nloo0\n\n..\n..\n\n930\n32\n13\n54\n23\n205\n49\n31\n22\n200\n52\n28\n210\n900\n\n570\n39\n14\n46\n18\n320\n40\n10\n21\n170\n50\n24\n170\n720\n\n638\n\n44\n18\n49\n21\n304\n48\n13\n24\n206\n51\n24\n210\n922\n\n.\n.\n\n(b) Mineral Abundance.

Except for rock\nsample 14053, Fe/Ni ratios are the lowest yet\nobtained for lunar material. The Ni content of\nsample 14310 (165 ppm) is the highest yet obtained for a lunar basaltic rock and is higher than\nthat of most terrestrial oceanic basalts. Nickel is\nmore abundant in soil than in fragmental rocks,\npresumably because of greater meteoritic admixture. It is noteworthy that the average Ni content\nof fragmental rocks from the Apollo 11 site is\nsimilar to that of the soils from the Apollo 11 site,\nwhereas the Ni content of the Apollo 14 fragmental rocks is significantly lower with respect to\nthe Apollo 14 soil.\n\n10\n\n14305\n14066\n\n14301\n\n.01\n\n.1\n\n.5\n\n1\n\n5 10\nRb, P P ~\n\n50\n\n100\n\nFIGURE\n5-ll.-The\n\nK/Rb relationship for Apollo 14\nih\nrocks and soils compared w t selected Apollo 11 and\n12 rocks and average soils.\n\nsample 14053, are clearly distinct from those of\nthe Apollo 11 and 12 and Luna 16 samples. Considering average values for the abundances of the\nelements reported, the concentrations of Fe, Ti,\nMn, Cryand Sc are lower than in samples returned\nfrom Mare Tranquillitatis, Oceanus Procellarum,\nor Mare Fecunditatis. Silicon, Al, Zr, K, Rb, Sr,\nNa, Li, and La are generally more abundant than\nin previously examined samples. Barium and Y\nare more abundant in the rocks from the Apollo\n14 site compared with previous lunar rocks, but\ntheir concentrations in the soil are similar to the\nconcentrations found in fines from the Apollo 12\nsite. A comparison of Apollo 12 and 14 compositions is shown in figures 5-9 and 5-10.\nPotassium-to-rubidium values are remarkably\nconstant and average 325250 in the fragmental\nrocks and 330k25 in the fines (fig. 5-1 1). Unlike\nthe samples returned from the Apollo 12 site, the\nsamples from the Apollo 14 site have Rb/Sr ratios\nhigher in the rocks than in the soil. Both values\n(0.10-tO.05 for rocks and 0.06-t-0.001 for fines)\nare higher than in previously analyzed lunar mare\nbasalts. Iron-to-nickel ratios in the soil average\n260+25 and show remarkable constancy. In the\nfragmental rocks, more variation exists, and the\nFe/Ni ratios average 5352260. The values for\n\nThe soils and fragmental rocks are very similar\nin bulk composition. However, the average values\nof K, Ba, La, and Yb in the soil are somewhat\nlower than the average values for these elements\nin the rocks, which suggests that a small amount\nof exotic material is present in the soil. Rock\nsample 14310 is very similar to the fragmental\nrocks in composition, which raises interesting\nquestions about its origin. The most chemically\ndistinct sample analyzed is rock sample 14053,\nwhich mineralogically and chemically resembles\nmore closely the basaltic rocks from the Apollo\n12 site than other rocks or soil from the Fra\nMauro site. Apart from the K/Rb correlation mentioned previously and a similar correlation between\nK and Ba, little correlation is evident in abundances of pairs of elements. Relationships may\nappear, however, when individual clasts within\nfragmental rocks are analyzed.\nThe Rb/Sr chemistry of the material returned\nfrom the Apollo 14 site is clearly different from\nthose of the basaltic rocks returned from the\nApollo 11 and 12 and Luna 16 sites. Differences\nbetween Apollo 14 material and basaltic rocks\nreturned from the maria are such that rock from\nthe Apollo 14 site must be regarded as a type of\nlunar material distinct from the basaltic rocks of\nmare origin.\nThe previously returned lunar materials closest\nin composition to the rocks from the Apollo 14\nsite are the \xe2\x80\x9cnorite,\xe2\x80\x9d which are rocks enriched\nin KREEP (potassium, rare-Earth elements, and\nphosphorus) (ref. 5-6) component (or \xe2\x80\x9cmottled-\n\nPRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF LUNAR SAMPLES\n\ngray\xe2\x80\x9d fragments described by some investigators\xe2\x80\x99\nfrom the coarse fines returned from the Apollo 12\nsite), the dark portion of rock 12013 (ref. 5-7),\nand Luny Rock 1 from the Apollo 1 1 site (ref.\n5-8). The relatively constant compositions of the\nApollo 14 fragmental rocks suggest either that\nthe rocks were derived from an extremely homogeneous source or, more likely, that efficient mixing occurred.\nThe samples appear to be free from inorganic\ncontamination. Niobium, which is present in the\nn\nskirt of the LM descent engine, is found i similar\nabundance levels in samples taken near the spacecraft and at locations considerable distances away.\nNiobium was also found at approximately the\nsame levels in both rock and fines samples.

Fines were\ncontained in aluminum right-circular cylinders\nthat were enclosed in the stainless-steel containers.\nThe data acquisition followed the procedures developed for the studies of samples returned from\nthe Apollo 1 1 and 12 sites (refs. 5-3 and 5-4).\nThe activities of the radionuclides were determined by the method of least squares and by a\ncomputer-assisted spectrum-strippingmethod. The\nstandards used for data reduction were either\nright-circular cylinders, as described previously,\nor phantoms (replicas that contain known amounts\nof radioactivity) of samples returned from previous\nmissions. The results are summarized in table 5-V.\nThe errors that are indicated in table 5-V include\nthe statistical errors, but most of the errors are\ncaused by differences in thickness and shape between the samples and the standards.\nFive Apollo 14 soil samples have uniform K\ncontents of approximately 0.5 percent. These\nsamples all have similar thorium (Th) and uranium\n(U) contents, which are approximately 14 and 4\nppm, respectively. The concentrations of K, Th,\nand U in Apollo 14 soils are higher than those in\nApollo 1 1 and 12 soil samples. The K/U ratios\naverage 1100 and are somewhat lower than those\nin Apollo 1 1 and 12 samples, but the Th/U ratios,\nwhich average 3.7, are comparable to the Th/U\nratios of previously returned samples.\nThe fragmental rocks, with the exception of\nsample 14082 (White Rock), have K values that\nrange from 0.3 to 0.7 percent, Th values that\nrange from 9 to 16 ppm, and U values that range\nfrom 2.5 to 4.1 ppm. These values, which are\ncomparable to those of sample 12034, are higher\nthan those of most of the samples returned from\nprevious missions. The K/U ratios for the fragmental-rock samples average 1300 and are thus\nlower than the Apollo 12 ratios. The Th/U ratios,\nwhich average 3.7, are close to the average ratios\nfor samples from the Apollo 1 1 and 12 sites.

Elementalabundance ratios and the isotopic ratios of helium\n(He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) for the four rock\nsamples are also similar to those of solar-windimplanted gases found in previously returned\nsamples.\nRock samples 14063,14066,14305, and 14321\ncontain noble gases that have resulted from radiogenic decay of 40Ar\nand \'He and from cosmic-ray\ninteractions. Also found are small variable quantities of solar-wind gases that are probably present\nin the lunar dust that contaminates the surfaces\nof the small samples (average weight, 13 mg).\nBy combining values for the radiogenic \' O A r concentrations in these rocks with values for the K\ncontents (tables 5-111 and 5-1V), gas-retention\nages that range from 2.8 to 3.8 billion yr result.\nSample heterogeneity and possible gas loss make\nthese values uncertain and, at best, they represent\nonly lower limits to the crystallization ages of the\nrocks. However, unlike the analyses of the fragmental rocks returned from the Apollo 1 1 and 12\nsites, analyses of these rocks by the use of the\n\'oAr/a\'Ar method should result in accurate ages.\nIf the formation of fragmental rocks of low solarwind-gas content involved the incorporation and\ndegassing of surface fine material, this formation\nmust have occurred more than 3 billion yr ago for\nradiogenic "Ar to have accumulated. Alternatively,\nthe material incorporated into the four rocks has\nnever contained a significant solar-wind component.\nCalculated concentrations of some spallation-\n\n127\n\nproduced noble-gas isotopes that were found in\nthese samples are listed in table 5-VI11 (after ref.\n5-10). Also listed are some approximate surfaceexposure ages calculated from these spallation\nisotopes. Rock samples 14063, 14066, 14321, and\n14305 contain similar concentrations of each spallation nuclide. Exposure ages generally fall in the\nrange of 10 to 20 million yr, with reasonable\nagreement among the ages calculated on the basis\nof different spallation isotopes. These four rocks\nmay have actually had the same exposure time,\nwith the age variations resulting from differing\nshielding conditions and analytical uncertainties.\nOne could speculate that the formation of those\nrocks dates the occurrence of a single cratering\nevent, possibly the formation of Cone Crater. The\nage of these rocks are considerably lower than\ntypical ages of 40 to 500 million yr for rocks\nreturned from the Apollo 1 1 and 12 sites. Rock\nsamples 14047 and 14049 and soil sample 14259\nexhibit spallation concentrations approximately\nan order of magnitude greater than those of the\nApollo 1 1 and 12 samples; but, because of the\npresence of solar-wind gases, these abundances\nare highly uncertain.\nThe isotopic compositions of krypton (Kr) and\nxenon (e) that were measured in several of the\nsamples are listed in table 5-IX. In samples\n14259, 14049, 14047, and 14301, the relative\nisotopic abundances are similar to those determinations of solar-wind gases in previously returned samples, with the addition of a spallation\ncomponent.

The\nsamples from the Fra Mauro site consist largely\nof fragmental rocks that contain clasts of diverse\nlithologies and histories. Generally, the rocks differ\nmodally from previously returned rocks in that\nthey contain orthopyroxene and more plagioclase.\n(2) The samples differ chemically from previously returned lunar rocks and from the closest\nmeteorite and terrestrial analogs. The previously\nreturned material closest to their composition is\nthe KREEP component (norite or mottled-gray\nfragments) (ref. 5-6) in the coarse fines from\nthe Apollo 12 site, the dark portion of rock 12013\n(ref. 5-7), and Luny Rock 1 returned from the\nApollo 11 site (ref. 5-8). The Apollo 14 material\nis richer.in Ti, Fe, M g , and Si than the material\nat the Surveyor 7 site, which is the only lunar\nhighlands material directly analyzed.\xe2\x80\x99 The rocks\nfrom the Apollo 14 site have much lower Fe, Ti,\nMn, Cr, and Sc concentrations and higher Si, Al,\nZr, K, Ba, Rb, Sr, Na, Li, and La concentrations\nthan the lunar mare basalts; are much richer in K\nand U than are the mare basalts; but have K/U\nratios that remain characteristically lunar, although\nlower than those of Apollo 11 and 12 samples.\nUranium, Th, and some other incompatible elements are significantly enriched (relative to most\nterrestrial basalts) in the material from the Apollo\n14 site.\n(3) The chemical composition of the soil closely\nresembles that of the fragmental rocks, except\nthat some elements (K, La, Yb, and Ba) are depleted in the soil (relative to the average rock\ncomposition). Most rocks and soils closely resemble each other chemically.\n(4) Rocks display characteristic surface features of lunar material (impact microcraters,\nrounding, etc.) and display shock effects similar\nto those observed in rocks and soil returned from\nthe Apollo 11 and 12 sites.

A positive correlation\nappears to exist between the solar-wind components (C and \xe2\x80\x9cNe) and the friability of fragmental\nrocks (fig. 5-12).\n(6) Carbon contents lie within the range of C\ncontents found in samples from the Apollo 11 and\n12 sites.\n(7) The surface-exposure times estimated for\nfour fragmental rocks are approximately an order\nof magnitude less than the typical exposure times\nfor rocks from the Apollo 11 and 12 sites and\nfall in the range o 10 to 20 million yr.\nf\n(8) A much broader range of soil mechanics\nproperties was encountered at the Apollo 14 site\nthan has been previously observed at the Apollo\nand Surveyor landing sites. At different points\n\n130\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nalong the traverse, lesser cohesion, coarser grain\nsize, and greater resistance to penetration than at\nthe Apollo 11 and 12 sites were found. These\nvariations are indicative of a very complex heterogeneous deposit. The soils are more poorly sorted,\nbut the range of grain size is similar to those of\nthe Apollo 1 1 and 12 soils.\n(9) No evidence of biological material has been\nfound in any lunar material to date.\nThe Apollo 14 rocks exhibit characteristics that\nare compatible with their hypothesized derivation\nas ejecta from the Imbrium Basin. The rocks are\nlargely fragmental and show pronounced shock\neffects, and the composition of most samples is\ndistinctly different from that of basaltic rocks from\nlunar maria. The crystallinity observed in any of\nthe fragmental rocks is compatible with the characteristics that would result from a single very\nlarge impact even in which annealing took place\nwithin a thick hot ejecta blanket.\nFragmental rocks within fragmental rocks and\nthe apparently complex histories of nearly all the\nreturned rocks deserve serious study. Numerous\npossibilities exist to explain the complex histories\nof these rocks: (1) excavation by the Imbrian event\nof preexisting brecciated material, including ejecta\nfrom the prior Mare Serenatatis cratering event;\n(2) formation of breccia within breccia during\nthe Imbrian event; and (3) local cratering events\nsuperimposed on the Imbrian event.\nI the rocks at the Apollo 14 landing site were\nf\nexcavated by the Imbrian event, then they represent a sample of the premare lunar surface to a\ndepth of some tens of kilometers. The presence of\nmicroscopically visible exsolution in clinopyroxenes and orthopyroxenes indicates that some of the\nrocks from which the fragmental rocks were derived cooled more slowly and thus presumably\noriginated at greater depths than the mare basalts,\nwhich typically exhibit only submicroscopic pyroxene exsolution.\nThe range of compositions and textures of\nclasts within the fragmental rocks suggests that\ntheir source area was complex. Nevertheless, the\nmajor- and trace-element abundances in the fragmental rocks and soils that were analyzed are so\nsimilar that extensive mixing must have occurred.\nThus, it can be inferred that the bulk composition\nof the source area was enriched in incompatible\n\nelements and depleted in Fe relative to the mare\nbasalts. The mineralogical and chemical similarity\nbetween the Fra Mauro material, on the one hand,\nand the fragments with a high abundance of\nKREEP component (or norite), the dark portion\nof rock sample 12013 from the Apollo 12 site\nand Luny Rock 1 from the Apollo 1 1 site, on the\nother hand, suggests that material of this composition is widespread on the lunar surface. Because\nthis material is even further removed in composition from average solar or chondritic abundances\nthan are the mare basalts, a profound premare\nlunar differentiation history that produced a lunar\ncrust is indicated. This differentiation could have\noccurred during the accretion of the Moon with\nthe near-surface accumulation of material that was\nrich in incompatible elements or in a process of\ncrust formation that involved the fractionation of\na considerable volume of the Moon early in the\nlunar history.\nThe basaltic rocks from the maria could not\nhave been derived from a partial melting of material of Fra Mauro composition (and the reverse\nis also true). Therefore, it would appear that both\nthe mare and nonmare areas of the Moon are not\nrepresentative of the bulk composition of the\nMoon but may represent partial melting products\nof the lunar interior. The extent and variability of\nthe rocks formed in the early lunar crust cannot\nbe determined without samples from other upland\nareas, and no compelling reason yet exists to assume that the Fra Mauro material is representative\nof the lunar highlands.\nThe extremely low abundances of C and the\nvirtual absence of H,O in lunar rocks are further\nexamples of the depletion of volatile elements\nthat have been observed in other lunar samples\nand also indicate that the probability of finding\nindigenous life on the Moon is increasingly slight.\nThe preliminary examination has shown that the\nsamples from the Apollo 14 site are complex and\nclearly distinct from previously returned lunar\nrocks and from the closest meteoritic and terrestrial analogs. The samples should present a considerable challenge to lunar scientists as they\nattempt to increase man\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of lunar\nhistory. Their study should elucidate a period of\nlunar evolution for which no similar terrestrial\nrecord is available.\n\nPRELIMINARY EXAMINATION O F LUNAR SAMPLES\n\nReferences\n5-1.\n\nGILBERT, K.: The Moon\xe2\x80\x99s Face.

Latham,"+Maurice Ewing," Frank Press," George Suttorn,"\nJames Dorman,\' Yosio Nakamura,d Nafi Toksoz," Fred Duennebier,"\nand David Lammlein a\n\nThe purpose of the passive seismic experiment\n(PSE) is to detect vibrations of the lunar surface\nand to use these data to determine the internal\nstructure, physical state, and tectonic activity of\nthe Moon. Sources of seismic energy may be\ninternal (moonquakes) or external (meteoroid impacts and manmade impacts). A secondary objective of the experiment is the determination of the\nnumber of the masses of meteoroids that strike\nthe lunar surface. The instrument is also capable\nof measuring tilts of the lunar surface and changes\nin gravity that occur at the PSE location.\nSince deployment and activation of the PSE\non February 5 , 1971, the instrument has operated\nas planned, except as noted in the following subsection. The sensor was installed west-northwest\nfrom the lunar module (LM) 178 m from the\nnearest LM footpad. With the successful deployment and operation of the Apollo 14 PSE and the\ncontinued operation of the Apollo 12 PSE 181 km\nto the west, a major milestone in the geophysical\nexploration of the Moon has been achieved. For\nthe first time, geophysical measurements can be\nmade on the lunar surface simultaneously at two\nwidely separated stations. These two stations represent the beginning of the network of observatories required for determining the locations of\nnatural events.\nSeismic signals from 79 events believed to be\nof natural origin were recorded by the three longperiod (LP) seismometers at the Apollo 14 site\nduring the 44-day period following the LM ascent.\nLamont-Doherty Geological Observatory.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology.\nUniversity of Hawaii.\nGeneral Dynamics.\nf. Principal investigator.\n\nOf these, at least two were moonquakes that\noriginated in the active region (A, zone), previously identified from recordings at the Apollo 12\nsite, and 12 others were possibly moonquakes.\nThe moonquakes occurred most frequently near\nthe time of closest approach between the Earth\nand the Moon (perigee), suggesting that the moonquakes are triggered by tidal stresses. Thirty-one\nof the events were also recorded at the Apollo 12\nsite. All events detected by the Apollo 12 PSE\nwere detected by the Apollo 14 PSE.\nThe greater rate of detection of seismic events\nby the Apollo 14 PSE is believed to be a consequence of the thick layer of unconsolidated\nmaterial that blankets the region (Fra Mauro\nFormation plus overlying regolith) and amplifies\nseismic motion at the surface. The surface-amplification effect may amplify noise as much as\nseismic signals; but, on the Moon, natural noise\nis so low that it has not been appreciably above\nthe threshold of any instrument yet deployed.\nThe A, zone is estimated to be nearly equidistant from the Apollo 12 and 14 sites and at a\nrange of approximately 600 to 700 km from them.\nExcept for the absence of the surface-reflected\nphases usually seen on the records from deep\nearthquakes, the seismic data suggest that A,\nevents, and perhaps all moonquakes, are deep. If\nthis theory is verified by future data, the result\nwill have fundamental implications relative to the\npresent state of the lunar interior.\nMany of the events recorded by the Apollo 14\nPSE were meteoroid impacts. Measurements of\nthe amplitudes permit a tentative estimate for the\nmass distribution of meteoroids that collide with\nthe lunar surface:\n\n133\n\n134\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nlog N = -2.32 - log M\n\n(6-1)\n\nwhere N (given in km-\'-yr-\') is the cumulative\nnumber of meteoroids with mass equal to or\ngreater than M (given in grams). One-half of the\nrecorded impacts occur at ranges less than 1300\nkm (nearest 13 percent of the lunar surface).\nTwenty-one percent of the recorded impacts occur\non the hemisphere opposite the Apollo 14 site.\nThus, it appears that impacts are being detected at\nvery great ranges on the lunar surface.\nOne of the largest natural impacts detected\nduring this report period may have generated a\ngas cloud that was detected at the Apollo 14 site\nby the suprathermal ion detector experiment\n(SIDE) sensor approximately 37 min after the\nbeginning of the seismic signal. If the gas cloud\nwas indeed the result of the impact that generated\nthe seismic signal, the meteoroid struck the lunar\nsurface at a distance of approximately 2000 km\nand had a mass of 10 to 20 kg.\nSeismic signals were recorded from two manmade impacts during the Apollo 14 mission: The\nSIVB stage of the Saturn launch vehicle and the\nLM ascent stage. The LM-impact signal was the\nfirst event of precisely known location and time\nrecorded by two instruments on the lunar surface.\nData from these impacts combined with data from\nthe impacts accomplished during the Apollo 12\nand 13 missions, and the lunar-surface magnetometer results are the main sources of information\non the internal structure of the Moon. The general\ncharacteristics of the recorded seismic signals\nsuggest that the outer shell of the Moon, to depths\nof 50 to 100 km, is highly heterogeneous in the\nregion of the Apollo 12 and 14 sites. The heterogeneity of the outer zone results in intensive scattering of seismic waves and greatly complicates\nthe recorded signals.\nThe nature of the zone in which scattering of\nseismic waves occurs is not precisely known, but\nit is evident that the presence of craters must contribute, at least in part, to the general complexity\nof the zone. The scattering zone appears, however,\nto be too thick to be accounted for solely by visible craters. Nor is it known whether the entire\nMoon is mantled by such a layer. It is possiblein fact, probable-that\nthe lunar highlands will\nreveal structures quite different from the maria in\n\nwhich seismic instruments have thus far been located. The lunar body beneath the scattering zone\nappears to transmit seismic energy with extremely\nhigh efficiency. This observation does not necessarily imply that the rock at these depths (greater\nthan 50 to 100 km) was never fractured; it may\nsimply be the depth at which rock, conditioned by\npressure, begins to behave more nearly as a\nhomogeneous elastic solid.\nThe impact data suggest that long-range propagation of seismic waves, where most of the path\nwould be located beneath the scattering zone, may\nbe much more efficient than thought previously.\nIt now appears likely, for example, that the LM\nimpact anywhere on the Moon would have been\nrecorded at the Apollo 14 site. I so, many of the\nf\nrecorded meteoroid impacts may occur at great\nranges from the Apollo 12 and 14 sites. No clear\nevidence for the presence of a major boundary\nwithin the upper 25 km of the Moon has yet\nemerged, although present data are too limited to\npreclude this possibility.\nSignals were recorded from astronaut activities\nat all points along their traverse and from the LM\nascent. The velocities of the signals from the LM\nascent agree with velocities determined for the\nupper 100 m of lunar material from the active\nseismic experiment (ASE) . The velocity of the\nupper few meters of unconsolidated material (regolith) is 104 m/sec. This value is quite close to\nthe regolith velocity measured at the Apollo 12\nsite (108 m/sec).\n\nInstrument Description a n d Performance\nA seismometer consists simply of a mass, free\nto move in one direction, that is suspended by\nmeans of a spring (or a combination of springs\nand hinges) from a framework. The suspended\nmass is provided with damping to suppress vibrations at the natural frequency of the system. The\nframework rests on the surface, the motions of\nwhich are to be studied, and moves with the surface. The suspended mass tends to remain k e d\nin space because of its own inertia while the frame\nmoves around the mass. The resulting relative\nmotion between the mass and the framework can\nbe recorded and used to calculate original ground\nmotion if the instrumental constants are known.\n\nPASSIVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT\n\n135\n\n..-- (Sun compass1\nGnomon\n_--Level sensor\n\nlaluminized Mylar) ----\n\nThree long-period\n\n--Long-period seismometer\nheater and controller\n\n1.52 m\n\nFIGURE\n6-1.Schematic diagram of PSE.\n\nThe Apollo 14 PSE consists of two main subsystems: the sensor unit and the electronics\nmodule. The sensor, shown schematically in figure 6-1, contains three matched LP seismometers\n(with resonant periods of 15 sec) alined orthogonally to measure one vertical (2) and two horizontal (Xand Y )components of surface motion.\nThe sensor also includes a single-axis short-period\n(SP) seismometer (with a resonant period of 1\nsec) sensitive to vertical motion at higher frequencies.\nThe instrument is constructed principally of\nberyllium and weighs 11.5 kg, including the electronics module and thermal insulation. Without\ninsulation, the sensor is 23 cm in diameter and\n29 cm high. The total power drain varies between\n4 3 and 7 4 W.\n.\n.\nInstrument temperature control is provided by\na 6-W heater, a proportional controller, and an\ninsulating wrapping of aluminized Mylar. The\ninsulating shroud is spread over the local surface\nto reduce temperature variations of the surface\nmaterial. In this way, it is expected that thermally\ninduced tilts of the local surface will be reduced\nto acceptable levels.\nThe LP seismometer will detect vibrations of\nthe lunar surface in the frequency range from\n0.004 to 2 Hz. The SP seismometer covers the\nband from 0.05 to 20 Hz. The LP seismometers\n\n.\ncan detect ground motions as small as 0 3 nm at\nmaximum sensitivity; the SP seismometer can\ndetect ground motions of 0.3 nm at 1 Hz.\nThe LP horizontal-component (LPX and\nLPY) seismometers are very sensitive to tilt and\nmust be leveled to high accuracy. In the Apollo\nsystem, the seismometers are leveled by means of\na two-axis, motor-driven gimbal. A third motor\nadjusts the LP vertical-component (LPZ) seismometer in the vertical direction. Motor operation\nis controlled by command.\nCalibration of the complete system is accomplished by applying an accurate increment or step\nof current to the coil of each of the four seismometers by transmission of a command from Earth.\nThe current step is equivalent to a known step of\nground acceleration.\nA caging system is provided to secure all critical elements of the instrument against damage\nduring the transport and deployment phases of the\nApollo mission. In the present design, a pneumatic system is used in which pressurized bellows\nexpand to clamp fragile parts in place. Uncaging\nis performed on command by piercing the connecting line by means of a small explosive device.\nThe seismometer system is controlled from\nEarth by a set of 15 commands that govern functions such as speed and direction of leveling\nmotors, and instrument gain and calibration.

In the flat-response mode,\nthe seismometers have natural periods of 15 sec.\nIn the peaked-response mode, the seismometers\nact as underdamped pendulums with natural\nperiods of 2.2 sec. Maximum sensitivity is increased by a factor of 6 in the peaked-response\nmode, but sensitivity to low-frequency signals is\nreduced. The response curves for both modes are\nshown in figure 6-3.\nThe PSE was deployed 3 m north of the central\nstation. No difficulty was experienced in deploying the experiment. Since initial activation of the\nPSE, all elements have operated as planned with\ntwo exceptions-instability of the LPZ seismometer in the flat-response mode, and intermittent response of the Y-axis of the gimbal leveling system.\nIn the normal mode of operation (flat-response\nmode), the LPZ seismometer is unstable for reasons as yet undetermined. This problem has been\ncircumvented by removing the feedback filter and\noperating all three LP seismometers in the\n\n1011\n10-2\n\nI\n\n10\'1\n\nI\n\n101\nPeriod, sec\n\n100\n\n\\I\n\n102\n\nI\n\nio3\n\ncurves for the LP and SPZ seismometers.

The SPZ seismometer has\noperated as planned.\nOperation of the gimbal motor that levels the\nLPY seismometer has shown intermittent malfunction. The motor drive has not responded to command on several occasions. In these cases, the\nreserve-power status has indicated that no power\nwas being supplied to the motor. The powercontrol circuit of the leveling motor is presently\nconsidered to be the most likely cause of this\nproblem. Motor actuation has been achieved in\na l cases by repeating the motor drive command.\nl\nMaximum instrument temperature exceeds the\ndesign set point (125" F) by about 5" F near\n\n137\n\nPASSIVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT\n\nlunar noon. The desired thermal control is maintained during lunar night.\nAs was recorded at the Apollo 12 site, episodes\nof seismic disturbances are observed on the LP\nseismometers throughout the lunar day. These\ndisturbances are most intense near times of\nterminator passage and are believed to be due to\nthermal contraction and expansion of the Mylar\nthermal shroud that blankets the sensor.\n\nResults\n\nThis experiment is a continuation of observations made during the Apollo 11, 12, and 13\nmissions (refs. 6-1 to 6-6).\nPreascent Period\n\nBefore the LM ascent, many signals corresponding to various astronaut activities within the LM\n\nc\n3\nm\nn\na\n,\nL\na\n,\n\n>\n\n0\n\nS\n0\n\nc\nn\n\nv5\ns\ne\n\ns PZ\n\n-30 dB\n\n0\n\n3.1\n\n13.8\n\n31.5\n\n56.5\n\n88.1\n\n127.1\n\n172.2\n\n222.0\n\n273.1\n\n325.9\n\n379.8\n\nLM altitude, m\n\nFIGURE\n6-4.Signal recorded by the SPZ seismometer from the liftoff of the Apollo 14 LM\nascent stage.

The astronauts\xe2\x80\x99 footfalls\nwere detected at all points along their traverse\n(maximum range approximately 1.4 km). A\nsignal of particular interest during this period was\ngenerated by the thrust of the LM ascent engine.\nThe signal began 0.67 sec after the burn began\nand lasted about 4.5 min. As shown in figure 6-4,\ntwo secondary arrivals can be recognized in the\nearly part of thesignal. These arrivals follow the\n&st arrival by 1.06 and 2.44 sec. By comparison\nwith the traveltime of seismic waves measured by\nthe active seismic experiment using the thumper\nsource, the first arrival was interpreted as a wave\nrefracted along the surface of a higher velocity\nmaterial (possibly the Fra Mauro Formation) located at a depth of 8.5 m (sec. 7 ) . The second\narrival had an apparent velocity of 104 m/sec\nand corresponded to a wave traveling through the\ntop (regolith) layer. This value is remarkably\nclose to the velocity of 108 m/sec measured from\nthe LM ascent at the Apollo 12 site. The third\narrival was probably generated by direct impingement of exhaust gas on the PSE. Following this\nabrupt increase in signal amplitude, the signal\nremained at a high level for approximately 8.2\nsec and then decreased abruptly. The decrease in\nsignal amplitude corresponded in time to the LM\npitch maneuver. Following the pitch maneuver,\nexhaust gases flowed parallel to the surface and\nno longer impinged on the surface in the near\nvicinity of the PSE.\nSignals From Impacts of the SlVB and LM\nAscent Stages\n\nSignals from two manmade impacts were recorded as part of the Apollo 14 mission: The\nSIVB stage and the LM ascent stage. The SIVB\nimpact preceded emplacement of the Apollo\n14 Apollo lunar-surface experiments package\n(ALSEP) station and was therefore recorded at\nthe Apollo 12 site only. The LM impact point was\nnominal and was recorded at both the Apollo 12\nand 14 sites. The SIVB impact point was closer\nto the Apollo 12 site than planned (172 km instead of 300 km) and, though well recorded, did\nnot provide the new information desired.

A later arrival, tentatively identified as\nthe shear wave (S-wave), is also indicated in each record. The DU is explained in figure 6-3.\n\nI\n\n120\n\n141\n\nPASSIVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT\n\nThe characteristics of the new impact signals\nare very similar to those of the previous impacts.\nThe signals are prolonged with gradual increase\nand decrease in signal intensity and with little\ncorrelation between any two components of\nground motion. Signals corresponding to the arrival of various types of seismic waves can be\nidentifled in the early parts of the records, but\nthey are less distinct than in normal earthquake\nseismic records. These characteristics are believed\n\nto result from intensive scattering of the seismic\nwaves, implying that the outer shell of the Moon\nin the region of the Apollo 12 and 14 sites may\nbe highly heterogeneous, possibly to depths as\ngreat as 50 to 100 km.Seismic-wave transmission\nand inferred lunar structure are discussed in\ngreater detail in the following paragraphs.\nThe beginnings of the impact signals are shown\non expanded time scales in figures 6-7 and 6-8.\nThe seismic records in figure 6-7 are spaced on a\n\n70\n\n6c\n\n:\nf\n\nEvents recorded by Apollo 12 PSE.\n\n\\\n\nEvents recorded by Apollo 14 PSE.\n\n5c\n\nz40\n\n.d\nc\n\n5\n(\nu\n\nE\n\n3c\n\n20\n\n10\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n50\n\n100\nDistance, km\n\n150\n\nFIGURE\n6-9.Traveltimes of seismic waves, assumed to be the direct compressional and shear\nwaves (P- and S-waves, respectively), recorded from the LM and SIVB impacts of the\nApollo 12, 13, and 14 missions. The phases are identified on the records shown in figure\n6-8. The beginning of the wavetrain from the Apollo 12 LM impact is so emergent that the\nfirst arrival (P-wave) cannot be identified with certainty. The phase identified as a possible\nshear wave (S-wave) is also uncertain. The solid lines are theoretical travelthe curves for\nP- and S-waves for the assumed lunar structure shown in figure 6-20. The P-wave data fit\nthe theoretical traveltime curve well, indicating that the assumed lunar model for the variation of compression-wave velocity with depth is a good approximation to depths of at least\n25 kin. The observed shear-wave traveltimes, if correctly identified, are shorter than those\npredicted by the assumed model. Thus, the shear velocities are somewhat higher in the\nupper 30 k of the Moon than those given in the model.\nm\n\nI\n\nm\n\n142\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\ndistance scale representing the source-receiver\nranges (\xe2\x80\x9crecord section\xe2\x80\x9d format) and are included\nprimarily to illustrate the complexity of the signals\nand the difficulty of relating, in detail, the waveforms of one to another. The times of phases corresponding to the arrival of various types of\nseismic waves are indicated in figure 6-8. Corresponding traveltimes for these phases are shown\nin figure 6-9. Traveltimes derived for compressional waves (P-waves) and shear waves from\nhigh-pressure measurements on returned lunar\nsamples are also shown in figure 6-9 for comparison. (This subject is covered in detail in \xe2\x80\x9cDiscussion.\xe2\x80\x9d)\nData From the LP Seismometers\nData presently being received at the Apollo 14\nsite on the LPX, LPY, and LPZ seismometers are\nsimgar in their main features to those recorded at\nthe Apollo 12 site, but some significant and useful\ndifferences exist. As at the Apollo 12 site, ambient\nseismic noise appears to be below the threshold\nof instrument sensitivity, emphasizing again the\nextreme quietness of the lunar surface. Events\nbelieved to be of natural origin, moonquakes or\nmeteorite impacts, are also recorded, as at the\nApollo 12 site, though such recordings are more\nfrequent at the Apollo 14 site. The gross characteristics are very similar to those of events recorded at the Apollo 12 site and similar in many\nrespects to the characteristics of the artificialimpact signals described previously. The principal\nfeatures are long durations measured in tens of\nminutes, an emergent beginning, a rise or buildup\ntime of approximately 2 to 15 min, and much\nslower decay or tailing off of signal strength. As\nat the Apollo 12 site, moonquakes can probably\nbe distinguished from impact events in most cases\nby several criteria, including the presence of an\nearly abruptly beginning phase (H-phase) that\noccurs on the horizontal components only. Conspicuously, the horizontal amplitudes at the Apollo\n14 site are in the ratio of approximately 3 :1 to\nthe vertical amplitude. At the Apollo 12 site, all\ncomponents are about equally strong, though\nminor variations from event to event have been\nrecorded by both instruments. For signals recorded by both instruments, the total ground-\n\nmotion amplitudes recorded by the Apollo 14\nPSE are larger than those of the Apollo 12 PSE\nby an average factor of approximately 2.\nAll LP events that have been recorded by the\nApollo 12 PSE since deployment of the Apollo\n14 PSE have been recorded simultaneously by the\nApollo 14 PSE. The reverse is not true. This interesting relationship appears to have a useful\napplication in estimating the distance of the seismic sources as explained in the following paragraphs. While simultaneous observation at two\nsites of signals from the same event is not sufficient\nfor locating the event precisely, many other\nmethods prove useful in characterizing the events\nand evaluating the comparative geologic structures\nof the two sites.\nData From the SPZ Seismometer\nHundreds of signals with a great variety of\nshapes and sizes have been recorded on the SPZ\nseismometer during the first 45 days of operation\nof the Apollo 14 PSE. The general level of recorded activity gradually subsided through the first\nlunar night following the initial activation of the\nPSE and increased abruptly at sunrise. Most of the\nevents are attributed to venting of gases and\nthermoelastic \xe2\x80\x9cpopping\xe2\x80\x9d within the LM descent\nstage. The PSE is located approximately 178 m\nfrom the nearest footpad of the LM. Similar\nsignals at even higher levels of activity were observed during the operation of the Apollo 11 PSE.\nThe higher level of activity at the Apollo 1 1 site\nis explained by the smaller separation between the\nLM and the PSE in the Apollo 1 1 deployment\n( 16.8 m) , (The Apollo 12 PSE was deployed\n130 m from the nearest LM footpad.)\nOne family of signals that occur near sunrise\nand sunset exhibits a sequence of pulses early in\nthe wavetrain; these pulses are identical to those\nrecorded during the LM ascent. This family of\nsignals is almost certainly generated by impulsive\nsources within the LM descent stage.\nThe variation of SPZ activity, whether LMgenerated or not, is clearly related to the solar\ncycle at the Apollo 14 site. Thus, possible sources\nof the activity are thermal effects on the LM, the\nPSE thermal shroud, the cable connecting the\nsensor to the central station, other ALSEP instruments, and the lunar soil and nearby rocks.\n\n143\n\nPASSIVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT\n\n35\n\nDaytime\nactivity\n\ntI\nI\n\\\n\n30\n\n\\\n\n25\n\nN\nE\n\nSPZ nighttime\nsignal power\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n20\n\nE\n\n\\\n\nN\'\n\na\n\nDaytime\nactivity\n\n\\\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n-\n\nJ\n\na\n\n19\n\nA\n\n20\n\n.\'\n\n3\n\nI\n\n1\n7\n\n-\n\n7-l-a\n\n_\nI\n\nn\n\n21\n\nSunset\n\nFIGURE\n6-lO.-Relative\n\nSPZ signal power during the first night after deployment, as a function\nof time. For each event, amplitude A is maximum peak-to-peak signal not exceeded more\nthan 10 percent of the time on seismograms where 0.5 mm is 1 DU. The height of each\nbar is the sum of squares of the maximum trace amplitude of events recorded during each\n6-hr interval. The average level of activity is shown by the dotted line. This graph begins\nalmost 3 days after the preceding sunset, which was at approximately 06:OO G.m.t. on\nFebruary 19. Activity before, during, and shortly after the sunset was too intense to be\nrepresented on the vertical scale of this graph, as was activity following the sunrise of 08:12\nG.m.t. on March 6. The apparent nighttime decay constant is several days, probably too\nlong to represent cooling of the LM. However, the cooling time constant of rocks and soil\nmay be of the magnitude indicated in this figure.\n\nThe seismic activity recorded on the SPZ seismometer during the first lunar night is shown in\nfigure 6-10. The level of activity clearly decreased\nthroughout the lunar night. The LM descent stage\nwould certainly reach thermal equilibrium at very\nlow temperatures soon after sunset, probably\nwithin 1 day. Thus, the continuing activity that\nwas observed raises the question of possible\nnatural sources of seismic signals. Meteoroid impacts at close range would be likely sources for\nsome of the signals. A cumulative-frequency curve\nof the amplitudes of nighttime SPZ events is shown\nin figure 6-11. The slope of this curve is in approximate agreement with the predicted slope of\nthe flux (ref. 6-7) for meteoroid impacts in the\nsmall-mass range (cometary particles). However,\n\nthe frequency of meteoroid impacts would not be\nexpected to show a gradual decrease during the\nlunar night unless a monthly variation in meteoroid flux is postulated. Thermal cracking of rocks\nof relatively recent exposure is perhaps a more\nlikely process that might have the observed time\ncharacteristic. It is expected that more definite\nremarks can be made concerning the sources of\nsignals recorded on the SPZ seismometer as the\ncontribution from the LM descent stage decreases\nduring succeeding lunations.\nNatural Events\n\nThe general discussion of SP and LP data leads\nto a more detailed consideration of the data on\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n144\n\n"i \\\n\nSPZ nighttime activity 13.6 days\n\nY10\n\nA, mm\n\nFIGURE 1 .-Cumulative amplitude distribution of A\n6-1\nvalues of same events represented in figure 6-10. The\nslope of this curve is appropriate for sources resulting\nfrom impacts of cometary particles, but the time variation of intensity as shown in figure 6-10 is not consistent w t that hypothesis.\nih\n\ndiscrete events of natural origin. The interpretation of these data rests on principles developed\nfrom study of artificial-impact data, described\npreviously, where the known time, place, and\nenergy input of the seismic source permit the use\nof a wider range of analytical methods. By contrast, the problems of determining the basic\nparameters of a natural event, such as distance to\nsource, time of origin, and source nature and\nstrength, are difficult because many techniques\nused in terrestrial seismology are not applicable\nunder lunar conditions. These conditions include\nnot only the sparsity of seismic stations but also\nthe strikingly different seismic-wave transmission\ncharacteristics of the Moon. However, substantial\nprogress is being made and some significant steps\nare represented in this report. Estimates of source\n\ndistance based on rise time of the signal are reliable to perhaps +20 percent out to a range of 150\nkm. An estimate of the law of amplitude falloff\nwith a distance can now be placed on a fairly\nreliable basis, permitting estimates of source\nenergy and providing an indirect method of range\nestimation beyond 150 km. It can now be estimated with some reliability that the Apollo 15 LM\nimpact near Hadley Rille 1000 km to the north\nwill be detected by the Apollo 14 PSE. Details of\nthese arguments and their application to natural\nevents observed are discussed in the following\nparagraphs.\nTwo sources of natural seismic signals are\nexpected: moonquakes and meteoroid impacts.\nLearning to distinguish them by differences in\nsignal characteristics is obviously one of the most\nimportant problems in lunar seismology and is\nsomewhat equivalent to the problem of distinguishing between earthquakes and explosions on Earth.\nFrom analysis of data recorded during the first 9\nmonths of operation of the Apollo 12 PSE, the\nmost promising methods for distinguishing between these source mechanisms revealed thus far\nare given in the following paragraphs.\nWaveform matching. Detailed comparison of\nthe seismic signals has revealed that some signals\nmatch each other in nearly every detail of the\nrecord for the entire duration of the signal. Three\nmethods have been used for identification of\nmatching signals: ( 1) visual comparison of the\nwaveforms, (2) visual comparison of energy plots\n(smoothed plots of squared signal amplitude as a\nfunction of time), and ( 3 ) computed coherence\nfunctions between signals. Through this combination of methods, a total of nine sets of matching\nsignals (71 signals) has been identified from\namong the 208 signals recorded during the first\n9 months of operation of the Apollo 12 PSE.\nThese matching signals will be designated category\nA signals for purposes of this discussion. The largest subset of category A signals (A,) contains 26\nevents and accounts for about 80 percent of the\ntotal seismic energy from matching events recorded by the Apollo 12 PSE. At least two of the\nseismic events recorded during the fist month of\noperation of the Apollo 14 PSE fall into subset\nA,.

A moonquake recorded at the Apollo 12 site on April 26, 1970, before the\ndeployment of the Apollo 14 PSE, is included for comparison. These three moonquakes\noriginated within the zone of greatest activity (A1 zone) detected thus far. The most prominent phases are tentatively interpreted as the direct compressional wave (P-wave) and shear\nwave (H-wave) arrivals. A high-frequency train of waves begins on the horizontal components at the Apollo 14 site about 8 sec after the P-wave. A similar signal is not evident at\nthe Apollo 12 site.\n\nrecord from an event recorded by the Apollo 12\nPSE before the deployment of the Apollo 14 PSE.\nThe identity between these signals for any one of\nthe components of ground motion is evident.

A second set of\nsignals, designated category C, has waveform\ncharacteristics similar to those of the artificial im-\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n146\n\npacts, and these signals do not match each other.\nSpectral characteristics. The seismic signals can\nbe classified broadly into two categories on the\nbasis of spectra: low-frequency signals and highfrequency signals. If, for example, the ratio of the\nsignal power at 1 Hz to the signal power at 0.45\nHz is plotted as a function of the signal rise time,\nas shown in figure 6-13, the signals identified as\neither category A or C fall into two distinct\ngroups. The spectra of category C signals (and the\nLM and SIVB signals) are richer in higher frequencies than those of the category A signals.\nThe H-phase. The most prominent phases identifiable in the category A signals are designated\nP- and H-phase (fig. 6-12). The P-phase is the\nfirst detectable signal and is considered to be the\ndirect compressional wave from the source; however, weaker signals may precede those presently\nbeing detected. The H-phase is a prominent arrival\non the LPX and LPY seismometers of the identified subset A, events, beginning about 100 sec\nafter the P-phase.

The\nratios of the spectral amplitudes at 1.0 and 0.45 Hz\nare not corrected for instrument response. To correct\nfor the instrument response, 16.5 dB must be added to\nthis scale. The separate groupings of moonquakes and\nevents believed to be meteoroid impacts are noteworthy.\n\nestimate of the difference in the arrival time at the\ntwo instruments. The H-phase is not observed in\nthe category C of the artificial-impact signals.\nRise time. The time interval from the beginning\nof a seismic signal to the time of maximum signal\namplitude (rise time) is variable, and is generally\nmuch shorter for category A events than for\ncategory C events. For category A events, the rise\ntime is relatively independent of frequency in\nnarrowband-filtered playouts; whereas category C\nevents and artificial impacts typically have frequency-dependent rise times.\nTime of occurrence. With few exceptions, the\nmatching signals (category A) occur at monthly\nintervals near the time of perigee, with a secondary peak in activity near the time of maximum\nseparation (apogee). The occurrence of category\nC events does not appear to correlate with the\nmonthly orbital cycle.\nHistograms showing the relative seismic energy\ndetected per day at the Apollo 12 and 14 sites\nduring this report period are shown in figure 6-14.\nThese graphs are derived by dividing the events\ninto daily intervals and summing the maximum\nsignal amplitudes squared for signals in each\ninterval. The shaded portions of the bars represent\nthe seismic energy from category A events. These\nevents are found to occur in a time interval within\n7 days before and 4 days after the perigee of\nFebruary 25 and within 6 days before the perigee\nof March 26. The secondary peak in moonquake\nactivity near apogee is not apparent in this short\nsample of data.\nEvents that produce virtually identical seismic\nsignals must have a common point of origin.\nMeteoroid impacts can be eliminated as a possible\nsource because of the very low probability that\nthey could be concentrated at the same point on\nthe lunar surface and would occur only in association with apogee and perigee. The clear relationship between the occurrence o the category\nf\nA (matching) events and the occurrence of\napogee and perigee suggests strongly that these\nevents are moonquakes induced by tidal strains\nthat reach maximum values at apogee and perigee.\nThe identification of 11 subcategories of category\nA events suggests that there are at least 11 distinct\nfocuses for the repeating moonquakes detected by\nthe Apollo 12 and 14 seismic instruments.

The matching events have a relatively abrupt beginning of P- and H-phases, in contrast to the gradual signal buildup of category C events. The\nnearest perigee occurred on February 25.\n\n149\n\nPASSIVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT\n\nsimilarities between the LM and SIVB impact\nsignals and category C signals strongly suggest\nthat these are generated by meteoroid impacts.\nIn all, 79 events have been identified from the\nrecords of the LP seismometers at the Apollo 14\nsite for the first 44 days of operation. In the results\npresented here, six of the events have been omitted\nfrom consideration because they were recorded\nwhile the instrument was temporarily in the flatresponse mode and were of very low amplitudes.\nThus, the principal data concern 73 events recorded at the Apollo 14 site over a period of 40\n\ndays of operation with the instrument in the\npeaked-response mode. Twenty-seven of the 73\nevents recorded at the Apollo 14 site were also\nrecorded at the Apollo 12 site. AU events recorded\nat the Apollo 12 site were recorded at the Apollo\n14 site. Based upon the criteria previously discussed, 14 of the 73 events are possible moonquakes (category A events) and 17 are meteoroid\nimpacts (category C events). The remaining\nevents are too small to be classified without\nfurther analysis.\nCompressed time-scale playouts of some LP\n\n=\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\n1\n\nCurves 1 and 2, A, mm\nCurves 3 and 4, A, mm\n\n1.75 - 1.32 log A\n\nI\n\nI\n\n10\n\n100\n\nFIGURE6-16.-Cumulative curves for all LP events at the Apollo 12 and 14 sites;\n\nn is the\nnumber of events with amplitude equal to or greater than A.

This places all identified moonquakes on curve 4 and all others, including most impacts, on curve 3. (See fig. 6-14.) Lines\nof identical slope fit curves 1 and 2 as expected, because the same distribution of events\nwas observed at both sites. However, the difference in slopes of curves 3 and 4 represents\na fundamental difference in the size-distribution laws of moonquakes and impacts.\n\n150\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCZENCE REPORT\n\nevents are shown in figure 6-15. The playouts are\nuseful for observing the shape of the signal\nenvelope and for measuring the rise time and\nmaximum peak-to-peak signal strength, quantities\nthat are used in further analysis. The H-phase is\nconspicuous on the LPX and LPY compressed\nplayouts.\nThe data for each station have been plotted in\ncumulative amplitude curves in figure 6-16. The\nordinate of the highest points on curves 1 and 2\nindicates the total number of events recorded at\neach station: 27 and 73 for the ApolIo 12 and 14\nsites, respectively. The slope of such a cumulative\ncurve is known (ref. 6-8) to depend only on the\ndistribution of source sizes and to be independent\nof the law governing amplitude falloff with\ndistance, independent of local variations in propagation effects or instrument sensitivity, and independent of any geographic bias in source locations.\nTherefore, as expected, the distribution for data\nfrom the Apollo 12 and 14 instruments has essentially the same slope because the same distribution\nof events was recorded by the two instruments.\nThz horizontal separation of curves 1 and 2 indicates that events of equal frequency are approximately 1.9 times larger in amplitude on the Apollo\n14 PSE than the Apollo 12 PSE. This should also\nbe the average amplitude ratio for an event observed simultaneously by both instruments.\nCorrespondingly, events of the same amplitude\nare 2.8 times more frequent on the Apollo 14 PSE\nthan on the Apollo 12 PSE. Because no geographic bias of event locations is known to exist,\nthese differences must result primarily from differences in instrument sensitivity. Indeed, a\ngeographic bias of the impact component of the\ndata would be highly improbable, though quite\npossible, for the moonquake component. The\ndifference in instrument sensitivity is thought not\nto be due to instrument differences, but to differences in the ground structure and in near-station\npropagation effects.\nIn curves 3 and 4 of figure 6-16, a perigee\ncomponent (primarily moonquakes) and a nonperigee component (primarily meteoroid impacts)\nof the data of curve 2 (the Apollo 14 PSE only)\nare plotted separately. The two groups can be seen\nto have frequency-amplitude distributions differing\nsignificantly in slope, which bears out the initial\n\nhypothesis that the two groups of events represent\ndifferent processes: meteoroid impacts and moonquakes.\nThe seismograms recorded by the Apollo 14\nPSE differ from those recorded by the Apollo 12\nH E , for the same event, in several important respects: (1) As mentioned previously, the average\namplitudes at the Apollo 14 site are larger than\nthose at the Apollo 12 site by a factor of 1.9.\n(2) The peak amplitudes recorded by the Apollo\n12 PSE are about the same on all LP seismometers, whereas, at the ApoIIo 14 site, the amplitudes recorded on the horizontal components are\nabout 3 times larger than on the vertical component. (3) A high-frequency train (1 Hz),\nbeginning approximately 8 sec after the P-phase\nfor the subset A, events, is present on the LPX\nand LPY seismograms recorded at the Apollo\n14 site.\nThese differences in signal characteristics between the two instruments were also noted for the\nApollo 14 LM impact, except for the impulsive\nbeginning of the high-frequency train observed in\nthe moonquake records. The beginning of this\ntrain cannot be distinguished in the impact signal.\nAs discussed previously, these differences appear\nto be explained by the presence of a thick layer of\nweak material at the Apollo 14 site.\nThe abrupt beginning of the high-frequency\ntrain may be explained by the arrival of shear\nwaves, converted from compressional waves at\nan interface below the instrument. Assuming the\nvelocity-depth relationship shown in figure 6-17,\nthe interface would have to be at a depth of\napproximately 25 km to give the 8-sec delay\nbetween P-phase and the onset of the high-frequency train.\n\nDiscussion\nSeismic-Wave Propagation and lunar Structure\n\nThe characteristics of lunar seismic signals previously described (duration of signal and lack of\ncoherence between components) suggest scattering\nof the seismic waves.

According to this model, the\nprimary surface waves and body waves generated\nby an impact and secondary surface waves generated by scattering of primary surface waves will\npredominate in the recorded seismic signal at near\nranges. At far ranges, most of the seismic energy\nreceived will have traveled as body waves through\nthe less disturbed zone at depth. Energy will \xe2\x80\x9cleak\xe2\x80\x9d\ninto this zone by scattering of the primary waves\nin the source region. Near the receiving seismometer, some conversion of body waves back to\nsurface waves will occur as the waves propagate\nthrough the scattering zone near the surface. Thus,\nthe apparent diffusivity increases with increasing\nrange as the signals that have traveled at greater\ndepths contribute increasingly to the recorded signal. Also, the envelope rise time will not increase\nappreciably at a range greater than that at which\nmost of the propagation has occurred in the relatively undisturbed material below. These ranges\nare estimated to be about 70 and 150 km for\nsignal frequencies of 1.O and 0.45 Hz, respectively.\nThus, the outer shell of the Moon may be heterogeneous on a scale of 1 wavelength (0.1 to 10 km)\nto depths approaching 50 to 100 km.\nThe precise nature of the heterogeneity present\nin the scattering zone cannot be determined from\npresent data; however, it is evident that craters and\ncratering processes must contribute significantly\nto the general complexity of this zone. The presence of craters, in an otherwise homogeneous\nmedium, has been shown to introduce appreciable\nscattering of surface waves (ref. 6-9). However,\nthe thickness inferred for this zone appears to be\ntoo great to be explained entirely by visible craters.\nAlternatively, it can be assumed that seismic\nvelocity increases with depth as a result of selfcompaction in a fragmented outer layer many\n\n153\n\nPASSIVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT\n\nr\n\nl4\n\n0\n\n0.45 Hz\n\n0 1.0 Hz\n\n0 2.0 Hz\nA 4.0 Hz\n\nV 8.0 Hz\n\nApollo 12 LM at\nApollo 12 PSE\n\n.-\n\nL\n\nE\n\n8-\n\n.E-\n\nApollo 14 LM at Apollo 14 PSE\n\n0\n\nc\n\nx\n.L\n\nApollo 13 S D B at Apollo 12 PSE\n\n.- 6 v)\n\nApollo 14 SIXB at Apollo 12 PSE\n4-\n\nI\n\n0\n\nI\n\nI\n\n50\n\n100\n\n1%\n\nI\n200\n\nDistance, km\n\nFIGURE\n6-19.--Rise\ntimes of LM- and SIVB-impact signals measured on narrowband-filtered\nLPZ and SPZ seismograms.

Even without a downward increase in block size, this is equivalent to a downward increase in diffusivity because diffusivity is\nproportional to the product of the mean free path\nand wave velocity.\nThe efficiency of transmission of seismic energy\nin the lunar structure is extremely high. Attenuation of elastic energy in a vibrating system is frequently specified by the quality factor Q where\n2 r / Q is the fractional loss of elastic energy per\ncycle of vibration. Thus, a high Q implies low\nattenuation. The value of Q is normally found to\nbe independent of frequency in terrestrial seismic\nexperiments. From empirical fitting of signaldiffusion envelopes based on equation (6-2), the\nQ of the structure in the region o the A p l l o 12\nf\n\nand 14 sites is approximately 2000 at 0.45 Hz and\n3000 at 1.0 Hz; that is, the measured Q for the\nlunar case increases with increasing signal frequency. When measured from the lunar seismic\nsignals from a single instrument, Q results from\na combination of leakage of energy into the deep\nlunar interior and the intrinsic energy dissipation\nwithin the lunar material. If attenuation of detectable seismic signals introduced by downward loss\nof seismic energy is relatively independent of frequency, then the measured Q will increase with\nincreasing frequency, as is observed, and the\nintrinsic energy dissipation within the lunar material must be higher than the measured values.\nThe values of Q measured from the lunar seismic signals are an order of magnitude higher than\n\n154\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nBody waves and surface\nwaves generated\n\nv\n\nBody wave transmission in relatively homogeneous zone\n\nFIGURE\n6-20.Schematic diagram illustrating seismic-wave transmission in the Moon as described in the text. According to the proposed model, seismic waves generated at or near\nthe surface are scattered intensively in a surface zone (scattering zone) with maximum\nthickness of 50 to 100 km. As the primary waves travel outward from the source, some of\nthe seismic energy is scattered downward and \xe2\x80\x9cleaks\xe2\x80\x9d into the interior as compressional\nwaves and shear waves. Seismic waves travel through the interior (homogeneous zone) with\nlittle or no scattering and with very high efficiency, returning to the surface through the\nscattering zone.\n\nthose measured in surficial layers on Earth. Low\nabsorption of seismic-wave energy in the lunar\nmaterial may be explained by the nearly complete\nabsence of volatiles. In the absence of volatiles,\ngrain or fragments may be locked securely together (possibly cold welded), thus preventing\nfrictional losses introduced by slippage at points\nof contact for the small strains associated with the\npassage of a seismic wave. Also, frictional losses\naccompanying small motions of interstitial fluids\ninduced by passage of seismic waves must be\nabsent. Some experimental evidence in support of\nthis suggestion has been given (ref. 6-10).\nAdditional detailed information on the lunar\nstructure in the vicinity of the Apollo 12 and 14\nsites can be gained from the velocities of compressional and shear waves observed from the LM and\nSIVB impacts. As shown in figure 6-9, the traveltimes of seismic waves from these impacts are in\nclose agreement with those predicted from laboratory measurements of the pressure dependence of\nthe elastic properties of returned lunar samples.\n\nCompressional-wave data were determined for a\nporous igneous rock (ref. 6-11), and shear-wave\ndata were determined for a sample of similar rock\n(ref. 6-12). The variations of compressional- and\nshear-wave velocities with depth, as derived from\nthese measurements, are modified (fig. 6-17) at\nshallow depths to be consistent with the direct\nmeasurements obtained from the LM ascent and\nthe ASE (sec. 7). Given the lack of traveltime\ndata for distances between the local landing-site\nmeasurements and the Apollo 14 LM impact of\n67 km, the curves of figure 6-17 are poorly determined at intermediate depths of a few kilometers.\nRecognizing these obvious limitations, the velocitydepth functions of figure 6-17 can be accepted\nas the best estimates obtainable from the present\ndata.\nThe simplest hypothesis consistent with this\nmodel is that there is loosely consolidated material\nnear the surface with a strong velocity increase\nfrom self-compaction to depths of at least 25 km\n(the greatest depth of penetration of compressional\n\n155\n\nPASSIVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT\n\nwaves received from the SIVB impact). No evidence exists for a major horizontal discontinuity\nin this zone that might be equivalent to the crustmantle interface on Earth, although present data\nare not sufficient to rule out the possibility o\nf\nsignificant layering. Seismic-wave velocities at\nshallow depth are too low for homogeneous\nigneous rock. A compressional-wave velocity o\nf\n6 km/sec is attained at depths somewhere between\n6 and 20 km. In this depth range, the elastic\nproperties of the material, conditioned by pressure,\napproach those of homogeneous rock. This structure may have formed from individual fragments\nduring the final stages of accretion of the Moon;\nor it may be the remnant of a solidified primitive\nigneous crust that was pulverized by meteoroid\nimpact. By either of these hypotheses, the outer\nlayer may have been modified by episodes of maria\nfilling that left a basaltic surface that has since\nbeen modified by continuing meteoroid impacts.\nThe much higher seismic amplitude recorded by\nthe Apollo 14 PSE from the LM impact is thought\nto reflect primarily the shallow structure near the\nsite. A very prominent 1-Hz signal is present on\nhorizontal-component seismograms that is not\npresent on the vertical component nor on any\ncomponent at the Apollo 12 site. The spectra for\nthe vertical component at the Apollo 14 site peak\nat about 1.8 Hz, whereas the 1-Hz signal component accounts for horizontal signal envelopes\nthat are much larger than for the vertical component (fig. 6-6). The ratio of horizontal-tovertical particle motion taken from the signal\nspectra near the time of maximum signal intensity\nis shown in figure 6-21. The amplification of\nhorizontal motion near 1 HZ is obvious from this\nfigure.\nThe most obvious structural difference that may\naccount for the observed seismic differences between the Apollo 12 and 14 sites is the presence\nat the Apollo 14 site of a surface layer of unconsolidated material of very low velocity overlying\nmaterial of higher velocity that is probably the\nFra Mauro Formation. The thickness of the surface layer as determined from the ASE results is\napproximately 8.5 m (sec. 7). This layer probably\nthickens toward the ridges to the east and west of\nthe Apollo 14 site. Seismic measurements at the\nApollo 12 site do not indicate the presence of a\n\ne 25r\n\nPeriod, sec\n\nFIGURE\n6-21.-Ratio\n\nof the spectral amplitudes of horizontal ground motion H (average of the two horizontal components) to vertical ground motion Z for the\nApollo 14 LM-impact signal recorded at the Apollo 14\nsite. A 3-min data sample, taken near the time of\nmaximum signal intensity, was used in the calculation\nof the spectra. The ratio plot shows that a strong 1-Hz\nsignal, present on the horizontal components, is either\nweak or entirely absent in the vertical component of\nground motion.\n\nsurface layer with a well-defined lower boundary\nat the Apollo 12 landing site.\nAmplification of seismic waves by near-surface,\nlow-velocity layers is a well-known phenomenon.\nBecause the 1-Hz signal can be seen on the horizontal components only, the wave motion is\nassumed to be horizontally polarized shear waves\nor steeply incident vertically polarized shear\nwaves. The frequency of the recorded signal will\nbe given approximately by f = p / 4 H , where f is\nthe signal frequency, p is the shear-wave velocity\nin the top layer, and H is the thickness of the\nlayer. Using shear-wave velocities shown in figure 6-17, p E 50 m/sec. Thus, for f = 1.0 Hz,\nH is 12.5 m, which is near the value obtained from\nthe Apollo 14 ASE.\nThus, the presence of the low-velocity suriicial\nlayer at the Apollo 14 site appears to account for\nthe observed amplification of horizontal motion.\nThe same spectral peaks and associated horizontal\namplification are observed in the signals from\nnatural events at the Apollo 14 site and appear to\n\n156\n\nAPOLIX) 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nexplain why twice as many events are detected at\nthe Apollo 14 site as at the Apollo 12 site.\nImportant elements of a lunar seismic-transmission model may be drawn from the data\npreviously discussed. From equation (6-2) , it\nmay be shown that, neglecting losses ( Q + a),\nthe peak amplitude of a wave diffusing in the\nsurface-scattering layer varies with range as l/r.\nRegardingthe lunar interior, arguments based on\npetrology and bulk density lead to models in which\nvariations of wave velocity with depth are quite\nsmall (ref. 6-13). Indeed, from the traveltime\ndata and rock experiments previously discussed,\nit appears that, within a 20-km depth, the seismic\nvelocity rises to approximately 6 km/sec, which\nis near the maximum value expected at any depth.\nThus, even though surface values are low, the zone\nof strong gradients is thin, and wave amplitudes\nin the interior of the Moon may closely follow the\nl / r law that applies to a medium with constant\nvelocity. Through this combination of effects, the\nl/r spreading law seems reasonable for arrivals\nobserved both at near and far ranges. According\nto these observations, amplitudes fall off less\nrapidly with distance in the Moon than for waves\ntransmitted through the crust and mantle of the\nEarth.\nTests of the l / r spreading relation were made\nusing ( 1 ) observations of the Apollo 14 LMimpact event at the Apollo 12 and 14 sites and\n(2) observations of the Apollo 13 and 14 SIVBimpact events at the Apollo 12 site. Each comparison involved use of r and signal amplitudes A\nmeasured on the various recordings. In the first\ninstance, the same event (Apollo 14 LM impact)\nwas recorded by both instruments; so a correction\nfor the average difference in amplitude sensitivity\nof the instruments was used (Al4 = 2A,,, as obtained from fig. 6-16). In the second instance,\ntwo events (the Apollo 13 and 14 SIVB impacts)\nwere compared on records of the Apollo 12 PSE;\nand a correction was made (according to the equation given in a following portion of this section\nentitled \xe2\x80\x9cMeteoroid Flux\xe2\x80\x9d) for the slight difference in kinetic energy of the two impacting vehicles. In each case, the inverse relationship,\nAr = constant, held within the estimated precision of the peak-amplitude measurements (5 to\n10 percent). The ranges covered by these tests, 67\n\nto 172 km, are more critical for behavior in the\nnear range, or diffusion regime, than for the far\nrange for which spherical spreading is postulated.\nThe more distant impacts of the Apollo 15 vehicles will be an important further test of present\nassumptions. The amplitude-spreading relation is\nextremely important in providing a basis for estimating meteoroid flux from observed impact\nevents, as explained in a later portion of this section.\nLocation and Focal Mechanism of Moonquakes\n\nOne of the most important objectives Qf the\npresent analysis is the location of the zone in\nwhich moonquakes originate. Moonquakes recorded at the Apollo 12 site during the i3st year\nof cperation are believed to have originated at\nno less than 11 different focuses, although some\nof these zones may be quite close to one another.\nA single focus (A, zone), however, accounts for\nnearly 80 percent of the seismic energy from\nmoonquakes recorded at the Apollo 12 site. At\nleast two moonquakes from the A, zone (fig.\n6-12) were recorded by the Apollo 12 and 14\ninstruments during the first perigee period following activation of the Apollo 14 PSE. The first\ndetectable signals from these events arrived at the\nApollo 12 site 0.9 sec earlier than at the Apollo\n14 site. Thus, the A, zone is nearly equidistant\nfrom the two Apollo sites (slightly closer to the\nApollo 12 site). The time interval between the\nP- and H-phases is between 91 and 98 sec at the\nApollo 12 site and between 102 and 107 sec at\nApollo 14 site. These ranges in the P- and Hphase time interval represent the uncertainty in\nidentification of the onset of the H-phase. The\ncomputed distance of the source from each site\ndepends upon the velocities assumed for the propagation of each of these two phases.\nAs previously discussed, the rise time of the\nsignal envelopes is a measure of the distance between the seismometers and the source at ranges\nless than some maximum value (approximately\n200 km). However, plotting rise time at one station as a function of rise time at the other for\nevents believed to be moonquakes (category A\nevents) and meteoroid impacts (category C\nevents) results in the graph in figure 6-22 in\n\nPASSPVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT\n12 r\n\n0\n\n---_\n\n.-\n\nc\n\na\n,\n\n.E 4 m\nc\n.-n\nc\n\n2\n2\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x981\n\\\n\nAevents\n0\n0\nOB::--=-Two\n\n*I\n\nI\n\nA, events\n\nI\n\nI\n\n\\\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nwhich the points for these two categories are found\nto fall into groups. A point corresponding to the\nApollo 14 LM impact falls into the impact grouping as expected. Because the LM impact occurred\nnearly along the line between the two stations, the\nshortest possible rise time for surface-focus events\nwould fall along the dashed line shown in figure\n6-22. The moonquakes obviously have rise times\nshorter than this minimum value. A possible interpretation of these data is that moonquakes do\nnot originate near the surface, but at appreciable\ndepth. Other factors that suggest this possibility\nare ( 1 ) the interval between the P- and H-phases\nis generally less complicated than the early parts\nof the signals from known impacts; (2) the Pwave amplitudes are larger for the moonquake\nsignals, relative to the maximum amplitudes in the\nwavetrain, than for impacts; and ( 3 ) the highfrequency train begins abruptly approximately 8\nsec after the P-phase in the moonquake signals\nrecorded at the Apollo 14 site, suggesting conver-\n\n157\n\nsion from P-waves to shear waves (S-waves) at a\ndepth of approximately 25 km below the site.\nIf the H-phase is interpreted as the direct Swave arrival, the abrupt beginning indicates travel\nmostly below the scattering layer. Using the Hand P-phase interval of 100 sec and velocities\nappropriate for those depths (fig. 6-17), the\nsource of the moonquakes is found to be approximately 600 to 700 km from the Apollo 12 and 14\nsites. Although the evidence is certainly not conclusive, it is suggested that the moonquakes\noriginate at significant depth within the Moon.\nMaximum depths of approximately 700 km are\npossible. The source of strain energy released as\nmoonquakes is not known; but, if significant depth\nof focus for the moonquakes is verified by future\ndata, it will have profound implications concerning the dynamics of the lunar interior.\nTwo pieces of evidence that bear on the question of the focal mechanism for moonquakes are\nthe polarities of the seismic signals and the cumulative distribution of moonquake amplitudes. With\nfew exceptions, the polarities of signals belonging\nto a set of matching events are identical. This\nsituation implies that the source mechanism is\nprogressive and not one that periodically reverses\ndirection. This observation suggests a secular accumulation of strain triggered periodically by tidal\nstresses. It is possible, of course, that detectable\nmovements in one direction are compensated by\nmany small, undetectable movements in the opposite direction.\nThe cumulative distribution curve for signal\namplitudes recorded for moonquakes at the Apollo\n14 site is shown in figure 6-16, curve 4. The slope\nof this curve, normally referred to as the b value\nin terrestrial seismic experiments, is 1.7. The\ncorresponding value for moonquakes detected over\na 9-month period at the Apollo 12 site is 1.6. The\nb values measured for tectonic earthquakes are\nnormally close to 1, whereas quakes associated\nwith volcanic activity (B-type volcanic events) have\nb values near 2. Volcanic earthquakes are presumably associated with the movements of magma\nunder pressure beneath the surface.\nThe b-values for seismic signals generated by\nheating and cooling of small samples of brick and\nsintered perlite were measured as approximately 2\n(ref. 6-14). This calculation indicates that high\n\n158\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMMARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nb values may be associated with seismic energy\nreIease generated by thermal stresses, whereas b\nvalues near 1 are associated with mechanical\nf\nstress in the rocks. I this argument is valid for the\nlunar stress mechanisms, one possibility is that\nmoonquakes are generated by thermal stresses.\nHowever, because the correlation between maximum moonquake activity and perigee has been\ndemonstrated, it is evident that tidal stresses must\nalso play an important role. Because depths as\ngreat as 700 km have been indicated by other\nconsiderations, it is possible that tidal pumping of\nma,ma at great depth may cause local thermal\ngradients that induce the moonquakes. To account\nfor almost exact repetition of these events, one\ncan imagine that cracks, propagating slowly by\ntidal stress cycles, are being invaded by magma.\nHigh b values are also measured in laboratory\ntests when two surfaces are rubbed together under\nhigh contact pressure. The situation might be\nanalogous to the shuffling of large blocks at depth\nby tidal stresses. These suggestions are obviously\nof the most tentative nature, but they serve as\nhypotheses against which future data will be\ntested.\nMeteoroid Flux\n\nWith l/r as a reasonable approximation for the\nrange dependence of lunar seismic signal amplitudes at all ranges, a relationship between meteoroid kinetic energy and seismic energy generated\nat the source can be expressed as\nMV\'u (Ar)V\n(6-3)\nwhere M and V are the meteoroid mass and\nvelocity, respectively, and A is the peak-to-peak\ntrace amplitude (mm) recorded at distance r\n(km) from the impact. The parameter p allows\nfor a nonlinear dependence between seismic energy\ngenerated by an impact and the energy\nof the impacting body. Thus, if p = 1, seismic\nenergy is directly proportional to the impact\nkinetic energy, and p < 1 implies that the proportion of impact kinetic energy converted to seismic\nenergy increases with the magnitude of the impact. This might be expected, for example, if the\nconversion efficiency increases for larger impacts\nthat penetrate more deeply into more compacted\nmaterial beneath the surface. It has been found\n\nthat 2p = 1.32 from the distribution of meteorite\nimpact amplitudes, as explained as foIlows.\nAssuming a constant meteoroid velocity, equation (6-3) becomes\nM =K(Ar)\'P\nwhere K is a constant of proportionality that can\nbe evaluated using data from an impact of known\nparameters. Using the SIVB impact data, from the\nApollo 13 and 14 missions and an assumed\nmeteoroid velocity of 20 km/sec, log K = 1.86\nis obtained. The same value of log K was obtained\nfrom the data on both SIVB impacts (tables 6-1\nand 6-11). This result tends to verify the assumed\n1/r spreading law because range and signal amplitude are the only factors in equation (6-4) that\ndiffer significantly for these two impacts.\nAssuming a slope of-1 (ref. 6-7), the cumulative meteoroid flux distribution is of the form\n\n-B -log M\n(6-5 1\nlog N\nwhere N is the number of meteoroids of mass M\nor greater that strike a surface of unit area per\nyear, and B is an arbitrary constant.\nSubstituting equation (6-4) into equation\n(6-5) and integrating over the lunar surface, the\ncumulative number n of lunar impacts that produce signal amplitudes 1A , can be expressed as\nlog n (yr-\') = -B -log K -2p log A\n\n+\n\n2a\nlog [r-\'P 2 ~ dr\nr\nJ\n\n(6-6)\n\n0\n\nwhere a is the radius of the Moon and r is the\nchord distance between the impact point and the\nseismic site. The quantity 2p in equation (6-6) is\nseen to be the slope of the amplitude distribution\ncurve for impact events. It is read directly from\nfigure 6-16, curve 3, as 2p = 1.32. From this\nsame curve, log n = 1.75 at A = 1 mm for the\n26-day period monitored or log n for 1 yr =2.90.\nTaking a = 1738 km for the radius of the Moon,\nthe definite integral in equation (6-6) has a value\nof 2.33 X 10\'. Substituting these values into equation (6-6), B ~ 2 . 3 2 obtained. Thus, the\nis\nmeteoroid flux distribution obtained from seismic\nmeasurements is\nlog N = -2.32\n\n- logM\n\n(6-1)\n\nPASSIVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT\n\nwhere N is given in km-a yr-\', and M is given in g.\nThe cumulative flux distribution (ref. 6-7), reduced by a factor of 2 to account for the reduced\nlunar gravity and Earth shielding, is\n10gN = -1.03\n\n- log M\n\n(6-7)\n\nwhere N is given in km-a* yr-\', and M is given in g.\nThus, the distribution of meteoroid impacts on the\nlunar surface derived from seismic measurements\nis a factor of 20 smaller than the flux estimate of\nreference 6-7 for meteoroids in the kilogram-mass\nrange. This result must be carefully examined but\nthe method is believed to be a promising one.\nIt can also be shown from equation (6-6) that\n50 percent of the recorded impacts occur at ranges\nof less than about 1300 km (median chord distance), or the nearest 13 percent of the lunar\nsurfaces; the remaining 50 percent occur at ranges\ngreater than 1300 km or the most distant 87\npercent of the Moon. Also, 21 percent of the\nimpacts detected must occur on the far half of\nthe Moon relative to the Apollo 14 site. Thus, the\ninstruments appear to be recording meteoroid\nimpacts from very great ranges on the lunar surface. According to the present calibration values,\na meteoroid of mass 1 kg or greater falling on the\nfar side of the Moon could be detected above the\nthreshold of the Apollo 14 PSE.\nRadius\' of Defecfabilify for Impacts\n\nDuring the nonperigee periods (figs. 6-14 and\n6-16), 15 events were recorded by the Apollo 12\nPSE and an additional 17, or a total of 32, were\nrecorded by the Apollo 14 PSE. The Apollo 14\nPSE events included all those detected at the\nApollo 12 site. The overlap relationship of these\ndata suggests an approximate statistical method\nfor estimating a minimum value for the ranges\nto which events are detectable from the two sites.\nAssuming that the nonperigee events are randomly\ndistributed meteoroid impacts, then the ratio of\nthe areas from which impacts are detected at the\ntwo sites (A12/ki14) must approximately equal\nthe ratio of the number of recorded impacts\n(N12/N14).Therefore,\n\nA1z - Ri," - Niz\n-----=-A I ~ Ri4"\n\nor\n\nNi4\n\n15\n32\n\n- 0.47\n\n(6-8)\n\n159\nR,2\n-= 0.69\nR14\n\nwhere R12 and R,, are the radii of the areas of\nperceptibility. Thus, impacts of equal energy will\nbe detected at greater range from the Apollo 14\nsite than from the Apollo 12 site by a factor of\n1.45. Also, because all events detected at the\nApollo 12 station are also recorded at the Apollo\n14 site, the area o perceptibility for the Apollo\nf\n12 PSE is completely enclosed by the area of\nperceptibility for the Apollo 14 PSE. Thus,\n\nR,,\n\n+ 181 km LR,,\n\n(6-9\n\n1\n\nbecause the sites are 181 km apart. From equations (6-8) and (6-9), R,,1580 km. This\nmethod is weak for ranges large in comparison\nwith the separation of the two stations, but it\ntends to confirm that events are being detected\nfrom ranges much larger than can be estimated\nfrom the rise-time measurements, and it is consistent with the l/r spreading law for amplitudes\nof seismic signals, which is favored for reasons\npreviously given.\nCorrelafion Befween Seismic Events and\nMeasurements of Neufral and Ionized Gas\n\nNo definite correlation between the occurrence\nof seismic events and the detection of increased\ngas pressure by the lunar atmosphere detector\nhas been noted during this report period. However, detailed comparison of records has not been\npossible during the preliminary analytic period\nrepresented by this report.\nIonized gas particles have been recorded from\nthe LM and SIVB impacts by both the chargedparticle lunar environment experiment and the\nSIDE. The apparent velocity of the leading edge\nof the expanding gas cloud varies between 1 and\n2 km/sec (secs. 8 and 10). The variations in\nvelocity possibly result from interaction between\nthe gas cloud and the solar wind. Ionized gas particles were also recorded by the SIDE sensors at\nboth the Apollo 12 and 14 sites on March 19,\nbeginning approximately 36 min after the beginning of the largest natural impact signal recorded\n(at 18:20 G.m.t.) during this report period (sec.\n8 ) . Assuming a common source for the increased\n\n160\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nion concentration and the seismic signal and a\nvelocity of 1 km/sec for the leading edge of the\ngas cloud, the impact must have occurred at a\nrange of approximately 2000 km from the Apollo\n14 site to explain the difference in arrival time of\nseismic signal and ionized gas particles. This observation strengthens the belief that meteoroid\nimpacts are being recorded at very great ranges.\nAssuming an impact velocity of 20 km/sec, the\nmass of the meteoroid is estimated, from comparison with signals from the SIVB impacts, to be\napproximately 10 to 20 kg.\nConclusions\nSeismic events of natural origin were recorded\nby the seismometers of the Apollo 14 PSE at an\naverage rate of 1.8/day during the 45-day period\ncovered by this report. This quantity is more than\ntwice the number recorded by the Apollo 12 PSE\nduring the same interval. The greater number of\nrecorded events by the Apollo 14 PSE is believed\nto be a consequence of the thick layer of unconsolidated material that blankets the region (Fra\nMauro Formation plus overlying regolith) . Amplification of seismic-wave motion at the surface of\nsufh a layer is a well-known phenomenon.\nHundreds of events were detected by the SP\nseismometer at the Apollo 14 site. Most of these\nevents are attributed to themoelastic stress relief\nand venting of e s e s within the LM descent stage.\nM a w of theeGnts, however, are believed to be\nowatural origin, because the occurrence of events\npersists at a reduced rate throughout the lunar\nnight. Local meteoroid impacts are expected to be\nthe main source of these signals, although other\nf\nsource mechanisms, such as thermal fracturing o\nrocks, are possible.\nThe natural seismic events are moonquakes and\nmeteoroid impacts. Of the total number of recorded events, 14 have been tentatively identified\nas moonquakes. The moonquakes occur at\nmonthly intervals near times of perigee. The r e\npeating moonquakes detected at the Apollo 12\nand 14 sites are believed to occur at not less than\n11 different locations. However, a single focal\nzone accounts for 80 percent of the total seismic\nenergy detected. At least two of the moonquakes\nobserved by the Apollo 14 PSE during the fist\nperigee crossing were generated in this zone. The\n\nactive zone appears to be 600 to 700 km from\nthe Apollo 12 and 14 sites and may be deep within\nthe Moon, though the precise location has not\nbeen determined. If, however, appreciable depth\nof focus is verified by future data, it will be of\nfundamental importance relative to the present\nstate of the lunar interior.\nCumulative strain at each location is inferred.\nThus, the moonquakes appear to be releasing internal strain of unknown origin, the release being\ntriggered by tidal stresses.\nA simple wave-propagation model for the entire Moon is now available. The velocity of compressional waves increases from 100 m/sec or\nless near the surface to 6 km/sec depths of 6 and\n20 km. This velocity structure results in a strong\nsurface waveguide. Natural events and artificial\nimpacts produce seismic reverberations of unusually long duration; this occurrence can be\nexplained by intensive scattering of waves in the\nouter shell of the Moon. The thickness of the\nscattering zone may be as great as 50 to 100 km.\nThe presence of craters alone is sufficient to explain near-surface scattering, but the scattering\nzone appears to be too thick to be accounted for\nby visible cratering alone. The nature of the\nheterogeneity that results in scattering below the\ncratered zone is unknown. Extremely low seismicenergy absorption, even near the surface, may be\na result of the nearly complete absence of volatiles in the Moon. Material below the zone of\nscattering behaves more nearly as an ideal seismicwave conductor, and variation of seismic-wave\nvelocity with depth is small at depths below 20 km.\nConsequently, seismic-wave amplitudes vary approximately as the inverse of range (chord distance to both near and far ranges. This falloff of\namplitude with distance is less rapid than in the\nEarth, a factor that, along with the very low noise\nlevel of the Moon, favors the detection of distant\nweak events. Accordingly, it appears that the impact of the LM ascent stage, or even a meteoroid\nof mass as small as 1 kg, can be detected at the\nApolb 14 site from any point on the surface of\nthe Moon. The Moon appears to be a more efficient \xe2\x80\x9csounding board\xe2\x80\x9d for meteoroid impacts\nthan had previously been suspected. Artificial impacts of the Apollo 15 mission will be a good test\nof this hypothesis.\n\nPASSIVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT\n\nBased upon the distribution of the seismic\nsignals received from events believed to be meteoroid impacts, the following tentative estimate for\nthe distribution of meteoroids in the kilogram-mass\nrange that collide with the lunar surface has been\ndeduced: log N == -2.32 - log M , where N is\nthe cumulative number of meteoroids (in km-\'\nyr-\') of mass equal to or greater than M (in g)\nThis flux is smaller by a factor of 20 than that\ngiven previously (ref. 6-7).\nBased upon the present wave-propagation\nmodel, one-half of the recorded impacts occur at\nranges less than 1300 km (nearest 13 percent of\nthe lunar surface), and the remaining impacts\noccur at ranges greater than 1300 km (87 percent of the lunar surface). Twenty-one percent of\nthe detected impacts occur on the far half of the\nMoon. Thus, it would appear that impacts are\nbeing detected from the entire lunar surface. Approximately one meteoroid impact per year of\nkinetic energy equal to the SIVB impact is predicted from the present data.\n\n.\n\nReferences\n6-1.\n\nLATHAM, EWING,M.; PRESS,F.; SUTTON,\nG.;\nG.;\nET AL.:\nPassive Seismic Experiment.

The components of the ASE are shown\nschematically in figure 7-2.\nThe astronaut-activated thumper is a short staff\n(fig. 7-3) used to detonate small explosive\ncharges-single bridgewire Apollo standard initiators. Twenty-one initiators are mounted perTransmitter\nantenna\n\nGrenade\n\npendicular to the base plate at the lower end of\nthe staff. A pressure switch in the base plate detects the instant of initiation. An arm-fire switch\nand an initiator-selector switch are located at the\nupper end of the staff. A cable connects the\nthumper to the central station to transmit real-time\nevent data. The thumper also stores the three geophones and connecting cables until deployment on\nthe lunar surface.

To provide an optimum launch\nangle for the grenades, the mortar package is deployed at an angle approximately 45 O to the lunar\nsurface. A two-axis inclinometer provides pitchand roll-angle (deviation from the vertical) information on the mortar package. The mortar box\nis a rectangular fiber-glass-and-magnesium construction in which is mounted the grenade-launchtube assembly containing four grenades.\n\nIn operation, an arm command from ground\ncontrol applies a pulse to charge condensers in the\nmortar box and grenade; a fire command discharges the condenser through an initiator, which\nignites the rocket motor. When the grenade leaves\nthe tube, a spring-ejected safe slide is removed,\nactivating a microswitch in the grenade.\n\nEach grenade is attached to a range line, which\nis a thin-stranded cable wound around the outside\nof the launch tube. Two fine copper wires are\nlooped around each range line. The first loop is\nspaced so that it will break when the grenade is\napproximately 0.4 m (16 in.) from the launch\ntube. A second loop is spaced to break when the\nrange line has deployed an additional 8 m (25 ft)\nfrom the first breakwire. Breaking the loops starts\nand stops a range-gate pulse to establish a time\ninterval for the determination of the initial grenade\nvelocity.\nThe four grenades are similar but differ in the\namount of propellant and high explosive (table\n7-11). Each grenade possesses a square cross section with a thin fiber-glass casing. The casing\ncontains the rocket motor, safe slide plate, highexplosive charge, ignition and detonation devices,\nthermal battery, and a 30-MHz transmitter. The\n\nA thermal battery and the electronics in the\ngrenade make up the firing circuit. The microswitch discharges a condenser across a thermal\nmatch to activate the thermal battery, which in\nturn powers the transmitter and produces a capacitor charge for the detonator. At impact, an omnidirectional impact switch closes, discharging the\ncapacitor into the detonator to ignite the explosive. The explosion terminates radiofrequency\ntransmission as an indication of detonation time.\nThe critical parameters measured are the detonation time, time of flight, initial velocity, and launch\nangle. Because of the ballistic trajectory followed\nby the grenades in the lunar vacuum, the necessary data are available to determine grenade\nrange. The planned mortar mode of operation for\nthe ASE is shown in figure 7-6.\nBecause some of the geophone parameters\nmight drift on the lunar surface, a calibrator circuit is provided in the system to measure these\nparameters to within 10 percent of the preflight\nvalues.

No dif6culty\nwas experienced in deploying and arming the\n\nmortar package. The mortar package is positioned\nto &e the four grenades in a northerly direction\nin alinement with the geophone line. The mortar\npackage assembly is shown in figure 7-8 as deployed on the lunar surface. A view looking downrange from the mortar package is shown in figure\n7-9. The geophone line appears in the right foreground.\nFor convenience, the geophone closest to the\nALSEP is designated \xe2\x80\x9cgeophone 1\xe2\x80\x9d and the most\ndistant is designated \xe2\x80\x9cgeophone 3.\xe2\x80\x9d No difficulty\nwas experienced in implanting the geophones and\nmaintaining them vertically in the lunar soil. Before beginning thumper operations at geophone 3,\nit was noted that the alinement flag at geophone\n2 had fallen over. Because of time constraints,\nthumper operations were begun at geophone 3\nbefore returning to check the flag and geophone\nat the middle position.\n\nFIGURE\n7-8.-Mortar assembly deployed on the lunar\nsurface (AS 14-67-9361 ) .\n\nThumper operations were begun at 18 :09\nG.m.t. and continued until 18:37 G.m.t.

Successful thumper shots were recorded at positions 1 (located at geophone 3); 2,\n3, 4, 7, 11 (located at geophone 2); 12, 13, 17,\n18, 19, 20, and 21 (located at geophone 1 ) .\nUpon reaching position 11, at the middle geophone, the LMP observed that this geophone had\npulled out of the ground, apparently because of\nthe effects of set or elastic memory in the cable.\nAfter repositioning the geophone, he resumed\nthumping operations. Even though geophone 2\nwas resting on its side during the first five thumper\nfirings, usable seismic data were recorded. The net\nresult of tipping a vertical-component geophone\noff vertical is to translate the mass and effectively\nincrease the natural frequency. Analysis of the\ncalibration pulse sent before beginning thumping\noperations showed that the effective natural frequency of geophone 2 had increased from 7.5 to\n13.4 Hz. The total time spent on thumping operations was 28 min, within allowable EVA constraints, and valuable lunar seismic data were\nobtained.\nSeveral thumper shots were attempted while\nthe commander was moving on the lunar surface\nnear the ALSEP central station. Unfortunately,\nhis movements generated seismic energy that was\nrecorded by the highly sensitive geophones. As a\nresult, his movements had to be restricted during\nthe remaining thumper operations. However, it\nstill may be possible to conduct thumper operations on the Moon and allow the second astronaut\nto move about, provided he is sufficiently far removed from the central station and geophone lime.\n\nDescription of Recorded Seismic Signals\nThumper Mode\n\nDuring thumper operations on the lunar surface, the LMP was instructed to stand still for\n20 sec before and 5 sec after each firing. Therefore, 5 sec of seismic data were recorded for each\nthumper firing. The seismic data recorded for\nthumper shots 18 and 20 are shown in figure 7-1 1.\nCharacteristically, the seismic signals produced by\nthumper firings within 9 m (30 ft) of a geophone\n\n169\n\nhave extremely impulsive beginnings and saturate the dynamic range of the ampliier for about\n0.5 sec. The predominant frequency of these\nsignals range from 27 to 29 Hz.\nAs the distance between the thumper firings and\nthe geophones is increased, the seismic signals\npossess more emergent beginnings. In figure 7-12,\na record section is alined in time to the same instant of firing for thumper shots 18 to 21 as\nrecorded at geophone 2. The wave trains build up\nto a maximum amplitude within the first 0.25 to\n0.5 sec from onset of signal and then gradually\ndecrease in amplitude. This effect can best be seen\nin figure 7-11 by comparing the seismic signals\nrecorded at 14, 32, and 41 m (45, 105, and 135\nft). Little difEculty exists in picking the onset of\nthe seismic signals out to a distance of 46 m (150\nft); but, at greater distances, uncertainty arises\nin determining the beginning o the seismic wave\nf\narrival because- the signals are much weaker. The\npeak amplitude of the recorded signals typically\nf\ndecreases by a factor o approximately 60 in 61 m.\nMore refined data-analysis techniques applied to\nthe recorded seismic signals from the thumper\nmode of operation are underway.\nPassive Listening Mode\n\nThe ASE is also capable of operating in a passive listening mode and is commanded into this\nhigh-bit-rate mode for a 30-min period each week.\nSeveral interesting signals have been recorded in\nthis mode of operation. Two of these events, recorded on February 19, are shown in figure 7-13.\nThe signals have the largest amplitude on a single\ngeophone, although the signal is definitely discernible above the ambient noise level, but greatly\nreduced in amplitude on the other geophone\nchannels.\nThe signal recorded on geophone 1 beginning\nat about 15:29:41 G.m.t. has a predominant frequency of approximately 36 Hz, whereas the\nsignal recorded by geophone 2 at approximately\n15 :3 8 :46 G.m.t. has a frequency of approximately\n47 Hz. Both of these signals have impulsive beginnings and relatively short durations of 6 to\n10 sec. Maximum amplitudes occur at the beginning of the wave train.\n\n170\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nShot 20\n\nT\n\n2.4 V\n\n-I_\n\nGeophone 3\n\n87 rn\n\nShot 18\n\n!\n\n,I\n\nI t\n\nGeophone 2\n\n32 m\n\nGeophone 3\n\n78 m\n\ns , f/\nh.\n\nq-\n\nyd>-4*\n\n.\n\n$\n\n!\n\nl\n\nJ\n\n&\n\n\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n?\n\n-\n\n*\n\n,\n\n-\n\n\\\n\np\n\nr\n\nW\n\n,\n\n~\n\n*\n\n~\n\nFIGURE\n7-11.Seismic signals produced by thumper firings 18 and 20 on the lunar surface.\n\n21-2 46 m\n\nFIGURE\n7-12.Seismic signals produced by thumper firings 18 to 21 as recorded at geophone\n2.

For example, the traveltime for thumper shot 21 to geophone 2 and\nthumper shot 11 to geophone 1 should be identical.\nThe near identity of reverse tie points 21-2 and\n11-1 and of 11-3 and 1-2 lends strength to the\ndata interpretation. Agreement between reverse\ntie points 1-1 and 21-3 is somewhat poorer, but\nit should be remembered that the more distant\nthumper .firings produced much weaker seismic\nsignals for which it is difficult to determine unambiguously an initial onset. An example of traveltimes that cannot be precisely determined is 18-3,\nand the range of possible traveltimes is shown\nby the line.\nTwo P-wave velocities are evident in the traveltime data. A direct arrival is observed with a\nP-wave velocity of 104 m/sec together with a\nfaster arrival possessing a velocity of 299 m/sec.\nNo apparent variation exists in P-wave velocities\nacross the section sampled as is evidenced by the\n\nconformance of seismic velocities measured along\nthe geophone line.\nThe depth to the 299-m/sec refracting horizon\nis 8.5 m. It is proposed that this thin upper layer\npossessing a seismic velocity of 104 m/sec represents the fragmental veneer of unconsolidated\nparticulate debris-the lunar regolith that covers\nthe surface at the Fra Mauro site. I the disconf\ntinuity between the 104-m/sec and the 299-m/sec\nmaterial is accepted as the base of the regolith,\nthe thickness of the regolith is very similar to that\nestimated solely on geological evidence. By photographic studies of the depth at which blocky\nfloors appear \xe2\x80\x98in fresh craters, it has been inferred\nthat the fragmental, surficial layer that overlies\nthe more consolidated or semiconsolidated substrate at the Fra Mauro site ranges in thickness\nfrom 5 to 12 m (ref. 7-3).\nFrom measurement of the elapsed time between\nengine ignition and signal arrival at the Apollo 12\nPSE for the reaction control system test firings\nand for the LM ascent, the compressional velocity\nof the lunar-surface material at the Apollo 12 site\nwas determined to be approximately 108 m/sec\n\n2.0,\n\n1.6 -\n\ng 1.2 VI\n\n.- - E\n\ny,,\n\nassumed = 610 mlsec\n\n----0\n\n30\n\nFIGURE\n7-15.-First\n\n60\n\n90\n\nDistance, m\n\narrival\n\n120\n\n150\n\n180\n\nand second arrivals from the LM ascent as recorded by the PSE compared\nto the extrapolated traveltime/distance data derived from the thumper firings.\n\n210\n\n173\n\nACTIVE SEISMIC EXPERIMENT\n\n(ref. 7-4). This value is in exceedingly close agreement with that measured for the surface material\nat the Apollo 14 Fra Mauro site and is also consistent with estimates derived on the basis of\nmechanical properties measured by Surveyor (ref.\n7-5). Therefore, it can be argued that the fragmental and comminuted layer that covers much of\nthe lunar surface, although locally variable in\nthickness, possesses remarkably similar seismic or\nacoustic properties.\nOne other piece of evidence lends support to\nthis hypothesis. Seismic signals were also generated by the LM ascent and recorded by the Apollo\n14 PSE at a distance of 178 m (584 ft). These data\nare shown in figure 7-15 compared with the\nextrapolated traveltime/distance curves derived\nf\nfrom the thumper firings o the ASE. The observed\ntraveltime for the second arrival is nearly identical\nto that predicted for a direct seismic wave propagating with a velocity of 104 m/sec. A first\narrival is observed with a traveltime somewhat\nfaster than that predicted by a refraction from the\ntop of the 299-m/sec horizon, suggesting that a\nmaterial with a faster intrinsic compressional-wave\nvelocity lies beneath the 299-m/sec material.\n\nI the assumption is made that this underlying\nf\nmaterial possesses an infinite compressional-wave\nvelocity V and that the traveltime curve behaves\nin the manner shown in figure 7-15, a maximum\nestimate to the thickness of the 299-m/sec material\ncan be derived. Similarly, if only a modest increase in seismic velocity, such as to 610 m/sec\n(2000 ft/sec), in the underlying material is proposed, then a minimum estimate is obtained.\nThese assumptions lead to a minimum thickness\nestimate-of 38 m and a maximum thickness estimate of 76 m.\nAt this writing, it is somewhat premature to\nspeculate what the 299-m/sec material represents\nother than to comment that this velocity is similar\nto that measured in situ in blocky basalt flows\nnear Flagstaff, Ariz., or in blocky pumice deposits\nsuch as found at the Southern Coulee o the Mono\nf\nCraters, California (ref. 7-6). However, no inference to a specific rock type should be made\nbecause a wide range of velocities is often determined for similar rocks, and similar velocities\nare often measured for widely different rock types.\n\nNevertheness, it is interesting to point out that\nthe thickness estimate of 38 m to 76 m for this\nmaterial is not in disagreement with the postulated thickness of 100 m or so for the Fra Mauro\nFormation (ref. 7-3 )\n\n.\n\nThe relatively low compressional wave velocities\nthat were measured by the ASE argue against the\npresence of substantial amounts of permafrost in\nthe lunar near surface at this particular site.\nMeasured velocities in permafrost vary greatlydepending on such factors as lithology, porosity,\nand degree of interstitial freezing-but typically\nrange from 2438 to 4572 m/sec (8000 to 15 000\nft/sec) (ref. 7-7).\nIt has also been proposed (ref. 7-8) that the\nunconsolidated surface debris layer (the lunar\nregolith) together with a shattered crystalline layer\nforms a surface low-velocity zone to \xe2\x80\x9ctrap\xe2\x80\x9d seismic\nsurface waves effectively; this proposal helps to\nexplain the prolonged reverberations recorded by\nthe Apollo 12 PSE after the impact of the Apollo\n12 LM and the Apollo 13 SIVB. However, the\nassumed working model consisted of a 30-m-thick7\nsurface, low-velocity layer overlying crystalline\nmaterial that has an intrinsic seismic velocity some\n20 times greater than that of the surface-debris\nlayer. To date, the results of the ASE argue against\nthis hypothesis on a moonwide basis. Further details concerning the deeper structure of the lunar\nnear surface of the Fra Mauro site must await the\nresults from the ASE grenade firings.\n\nReferences\n7-1.\n\nMCALLISTER,\nBRUCE D.; KERR,JAMES; ZIMMER,\nJOHN; KOVACH,\nROBERT AND WATKINS,\nL.;\nJOEL:\nA Seismic Refraction System for Lunar Use.\nIEEE Trans.

The second\ndetector, the total ion detector, uses only a curvedplate electrostatic energy-per-unit-charge filter.\nAgain, the ion sensor itself is a channel electron\nmultiplier operated as an ion counter. Both channel electron multipliers are biased with the input\nends at -3.5 kV, thereby providing a postanalysis acceleration to boost the positive-ion energies\nto yield high detection efficiencies. The general\ndetector concept is illustrated in figure 8-1; figure\n8-2 is a cutaway drawing that illustrates the location of the filter elements and the channel electron\nmultipliers.\nA primary objective of the experiment is to\nprovide a measurement of the approximate massper-unit-charge spectrum of the positive ions near\nthe lunar surface as a function of energy for ions\nfrom approximately 50 eV down to near-thermal\nenergies. Therefore, the mass analyzer detector\nmeasurss mass speotra at six energy levels: 48.6,\n16.2, 5.4, 1.8, 0.6, and 0.2 eV. However, for\nthe Apollo 14 instrument, dependable laboratory\ncalibrations of the mass analyzer detector were\nachieved only at the two highest energy levels. The\ntotal ion detector measures the differential positive-ion energy spectrum (regardless of mass) from\n3500 eV down to 10 eV in 20 energy steps. For\n\nthe Apollo 14 mass analyzer detector, the range\nof the mass spectrum covered is approximately\n6 to 750 atomic mass units (amu). Twenty mass\nchannels span this range. The relative width for\neach mass channel A M / M is approximately 0.2\nnear the lower masses. In principle, the flux of\nions with masses less than 6 amu/Q can be obtained by subtracting the integrated mass-spectrum\nflux obtained with the mass analyzer detector\nfrom the total ion flux, at the same energy, obtained with the total ion detector.\nf\nTo compensate for a possible large (tens o\nvolts) lunar-surface electric potential, a wire screen\nis deployed on the lunar surface beneath the SIDE.\nThis screen is connected to one side of a stepped\nvoltage supply, the other side of which is connected to the internal ground of the detector and\nto a grounded grid mounted immediately above\nthe instrument and in front of the ion entrance\napertures (fig. 8-1). The stepped voltage is advanced only after a complete energy and mass\nscan of the mass analyzer detector (Le., every\n2.58 min). The voltage supply is programed to\nstep through the following voltages: 0, 0.6, 1.2,\n1.8, 2.4, 3.6, 5.4, 7.8, 10.2, 16.2, 19.8, 27.6, 0,\n-0.6, -1.2, -1.8, -2.4, -3.6, -5.4, -7.8,\n-10.2, -16.2, -19.8, and -27.6. This stepped\nsupply and the ground screen may function in\neither of two ways. If the lunar-surface potential\nis large and positive, the stepped supply, when on\nthe appropriate step, may counteract the effect\nof the lunar-surface potential, thereby allowing\nlow-energy ions to reach the instrument with their\nintrinsic energies. However, if the lunar-surface\npotential is near zero, then on those voltage steps\nthat match or nearly match the energy level of\nthe mass analyzer detector or the total ion detector (1.2,s .4, etc.), thermal ions may be accelerated\ninto the SIDE at energies optimum for detection.\nThe success of this method depends on the Debye\nlength and on the extent to which the groundscreen potential approximates that of the lunar\nsurface. It is not yet possible to assess either of\nthese two factors; however, the data from the\nApollo 12 instrument indicate that the groundscreen voltage does influence the instrument response to the incoming ions.\nThe SIDE is shown deployed on the lunar surface in figure 8-3.

When the Moon enters the\nmagnetospheric tail, the situation is reversed. In\nthis instance the Apollo 12 SIDE records extremely low fluxes (or none) of magnetosheath ions\nwhile looking in a direction about 55" from\nparallel to the magnetosheath, whereas the Apollo\n14 instrument looks upstream in a direction approximately 25" from parallel to the magnetosheath and observes energetic ions streaming down\nthe magnetosheath. A typical spectrum observed in\nthis region is shown in figure 8-5. The fluxes observed are considerably lower than those recorded\nby the Apollo 12 SIDE on the other side of the\nmagnetosphere; this occurrence is attributed primarily to the difference in look directions relative\nto the magnetosheath. A long-term study is expected to yield information on the symmetry of\nthe structure of the magnetosheath.\n\nenergy spectrum observed (17:21:\n59 to 17:22:22 G.m.t., March 7) by the total ion\ndetector in the magnetosheath region approximately\n1.5 days after sunrise.

The mass spectrum shown in figure 8-7 was recorded shortly\nbefore the energy spectrum of figure 8-6 and is\nremarkable in the high response in channel 5\nrelative to the other channels. Masses 17 to 24\nare recorded in channel 5, so the conclusive identification of these ions is not possible.

The mass\n\nspectrum recorded by the SIDE at 48.6 eV as a\nresult of the ionization of the vented oxygen atmosphere is shown in figure 8-8(a). The corresponding total-ion-detector energy spectrum (fig.\n8-8(b)) features a strong peak at 50 eV that had\nnot been present previously and that persisted for\nonly a short time. All the mass spectra observed\nto date with the Apollo 14 SIDE show statistically\nsignificant mass peaks only in the 48.6- and\n16.2-eV energy levels. This result indicates that\nthermal ions in the lunar ionosphere must be\npromptly accelerated to suprathermal energies.\nCorrelation With Apollo 72 SIDE\n\nThe successful deployment and operation of the\nApollo 14 SIDE in addition to the earlier Apollo\n12 SIDE established a pair of essentially identical,\nsimultaneously operating instruments separated by\napproximately 6" in longitude and less than 1"\nin latitude. The look directions, however, are 36"\napart, as illustrated in figure 8-4.

The total-iondetector records for the two instruments are shown\non the same time base in figure 8-9. The similar\nmagnitudes of the fluxes observed, the similar\ntime durations of the major parts of the event, and\nthe high ion energies recorded (2 to 3.5 keV,\nwhich is very unusual for this part of the orbit,\nbased on previous Apollo 12 data) all indicate that\nthis event is due to a rather well-defined cloud\nof ions that moved westward passing over the\nApollo 14 site, then over the Apollo 12 site. The\nmost intense portion of the cloud took about 3\nmin to pass one site, which implies an east-west\ndimension of approximately 130 km, based on\nthe apparent travel velocity of -0.72 km/sec between the two sites.\nThe Apollo 12 and 14 passive seismic experiments both recorded a relatively large seismic\ndisturbance that began at 18:21 G.m.t. and continued until well after the ion observations.\' This\noccurrence would be the first observed case of an\nion event associated with a natural impact event,\nif indeed these two events are related. The long\ntime delay between the onset of the seismic disturbance and that of the energetic ions casts some\ndoubt on this hypothesis, because the ions observed from previous vehicle impacts arrived\nwithin seconds of the seismic signals. However,\na strong dependence on distance or on direction\nor both to the impact may exist. The character and\nintensity of the ion clouds observed are quite\ndifferent from any events recorded in this region\nduring the previous 16 months of the Apollo 12\nSIDE data, which lends support to indications that\nthis event is related to the seismic impact.

The well-defined burst of ions, recorded first at the Apollo 14, then at the\nApollo 12, SIDE should be noted. This event occurred approximately 36 min after the\nbeginning of a long seismic disturbance. The high counting rates at 2.58-min intervals are\ndue to calibration signals.\n\nanalysis during this event was possible because\nthe ion energies are far above the range of the\nmass analyzer detector. For the present, the relationship between thc ion cloud and the seismic\ndisturbance is considered to be an open question.\nApollo 74 Activities Observed 6 y the Apollo 7 SIDE\n2\n\nThree major events of the Apollo 14 mission\nwere clearly recorded by the Apollo 12 SIDE: the\nSIVB impact, the LM ascent-stage flight nearly\nover the Apollo 12 site, and the LM ascent-stage\nimpact.\nThe two impacts (the SIVB and the LM ascent\nstage) did not produce as intense or as complex\nevents as did the impact of the Apollo 13 SIVB\nor the Apollo 12 LM (ref. 8-1), but they were\nnevertheless unambiguously recorded.\nThe nominal flightpath o the LM as it left the\nT\nFra Mauro site was, at closest approach, approximately 22 km north of the Apollo 12 site at an\naltitude of approximately 15 km. Ions from the\nLM were recorded by the Apollo 12 SIDE for a\nperiod of 100 sec starting 1 min after the LM had\npassed by at the minimum slant range of approxia J. W. Freeman, Jr., H. K. Hills, and M. A. Fenner:\nSome Results From the Apollo 12 Suprathermal Ion\nDetector. Proc. Apollo 12 Lunar Sci. Conf. (Houston),\nJan. 11-14, 1971. To be published in Geochim.\nCosmochim. Acta.\n\nmately 27 km. The time delay is considered to be\ndue to expansion of the neutral gas for some time\nbefore its ionization and subsequent acceleration.\nThe observations of the SIDE are shown in figure\n8-10. The lower histogram gives the sum of the\nn\ncounting rates recorded throughout the event i\nthe 50-, 70-, and 100-eV channels by the total\nion detector, while the mass-analyzer-detector data\n,are given on an expanded scale for the 20-channel\nspectrum nearest the maximum of the event. This\nmass spectrum was the only one during the event\nthat indicated fluxes significantly above background and was the only one taken at an energy\n(48.6 eV) at which the total ion detector indicated\nhigh ion fluxes. The 48.6-eV spectra taken before\nand after this one (at 2.58-min intervals) both\nindicated only background rates. This situation\nwas to be expected, because the total ion detector\nrecorded no ions in the 50-eV range at those times.\nThe observations indicate that the flux of 50-eV\nions reached the maximum at or very near the\nf\ntime of the scan of the 48.6-eV mass spectrum. I\nthe peak counting rate recorded in the total-iondetector 50-eV channel is taken to be a good\nindication of the flux 11 frames later, then the\ncomparison of the total-ion-detector and the massanalyzer-detector data indicates that the ions observed were predominantly heavy ions, rather than\nprotons. The mass spectrum indicated appears to\ndiffer substantially from that expected from the\n\n182\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n250 -\n\n5\n\n200\n\n0\n\n150\n\na\n\ntb\n\nN\nI\n\n-\n\nE\n\ne\n\nL\n\na\n,\n\nc\nm\n\nroo -\n\nE\nc\n\nc\n2\n\nv\nl\n\n50 1\n\n5000\n48.6-eV energy step\n\nL\n\n0\nc\nV\nc\na\n,\n\ng 2000\n0\nc\n.I\n\nm\n\nE 1000\n0\n\n.Lift-off at 18:48:37 G.rn.t.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n8\nTime after LM liftoff, rnin\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nFIGURE\n8-10.4bservation of the Apollo 14 LM ascent by the Apollo 12 SIDE on February 6.\nAll total-ion-detector counts accumulated in the adjoining SO-, 70-, and 100-eV channels of\neach 20-channel spectrum are shown as a function o time after liftoff.

The preliminary data analysis yields the\nfollowing significant observations.\n( 1) As the Moon enters the magnetospheric tail\nof the Earth, ions of 250- to 1000-eV energy have\nbeen observed streaming down the magnetosheath\ntoward the tail. The ApoIIo 12 and 14 instruments\nmay now be used jointly to investigate this phenomenon on both sides of the magnetospheric tail.\n(2) Intermittent intense fluxes of 50- to 70-eV\nions have been observed about 2 days after sunrise, with masses indicated to be in the 17- to\n24-amu/Q range. These are in addition to the\nsteady, more energetic fluxes (noted in the preced-\n\nSUPRATHERMAL ION DETECTOR EXPERIMENT\n\ning paragraph) observed at the same time. The\norigin of the ions is undetermined.\n(3) Energy and mass spectra were observed\nduring the venting of the oxygen atmosphere in\nthe LM cabin.\n(4) Corrdation of Apollo 14 SIDE data with\nApollo 12 SIDE data allows determination of\nwhether the ion events in question are local or\ncover a large area, or are due to moving ion\nclouds.\n(5) A large (- 130-lun) ion cloud was observed\nto pass over both the Apollo 14 and 12 sites\nduring a relatively large seismic disturbance. However, it is not certain that this cloud was related\nto the seismic disturbance.\n(6) The ascent flight of the Apollo 14 LM was\nobserved by the Apollo 12 SIDE, both by the\ntotal ion detector and the mass analyzer detector.\nIn addition to fluxes of ions of lower mass, a flux\nof ions was observed in the 66- to 90-amu/Q\nrange, which is heavier than the expected ascentengine exhaust-gas products.\n(7) Ions resulting from the impacts of the\nApollo 14 SIVB and the LM ascent stage were\nrecorded by the Apollo 12 SIDE.\nReferences\n8-1.

M.Carroll a\n\nPurpose of the Experiment\n\nAlthough the lunar atmosphere is known to be\nvery tenuous, its existence cannot be doubted. At\nthe very least, the solar wind striking the lunar\nsurface constitutes a source. The atmospheric\nconcentration to be expected depends upon the\nequilibrium between source and loss mechanisms.\nThe observations of the lunar atmosphere will\nturn out to be of greatest significance if the dominant source mechanism for the atmosphere is\nfound to be internal (Le., geochemical in nature)\nrather than external (from the solar wind) to the\nMoon.\nThe dominant loss mechanisms for lunar gases\nare expected to be thermal escape for particles\nlighter than neon and escape through ionization\nfor neon and heavier particles. At temperatures\nencountered on the lunar surface, thermal velocities for the lighter gas particles are such that a\nsignificant fraction of the particles have greaterthan-escape velocity. The average thermal-escape\nlifetime for particles on the warmest portion of\nthe Moon is approximately lo4sec for helium and\n10" sec for neon. Heavier particles require much\nlonger times for escape by thermal motion.\nParticles exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation\nbecome ionized in approximately 10\' sec and,\nonce ionized, the particles are accelerated by the\nelectric field associated with the motion of the\nsolar wind. The initial acceleration is at right\na\n\nt\n\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas.\nNASA Manned Spacecraft Center.\nPrincipal investigator.\n\n185\n\nangles to both the direction of the solar wind and\nof the embedded magnetic field; then the direction\nof motion is deviated by the magnetic field so that\nthe ionized particle acquires a velocity equal to the\nsolar-wind-velocity component that is perpendicular to the embedded magnetic field. The time\nrequired for this acceleration is approximately the\nion gyro period in the embedded magnetic field,\nand the radii of gyration for most ions are comparable to the lunar radius (or greater). As a\nconsequence of this process, particles in the lunar\natmosphere are largely swept away into space\nwithin a few hundred seconds (the ion gyro\nperiod) after becoming ionized. Thus, the time\nrequired for ionization regulates the loss process,\nwhich results in lifetimes for particles in the lunar\natmosphere on the order of 10\' sec.\nThe cold-cathode-gage experiment (GCGE)\ngives indications of the amount of gas present, but\nnot the gas composition. The CCGE indications\ncan be expressed as concentrations of particles\nper cubic centimeter or as pressure in torrs, which\ndepends on ambient temperature and concentration. The amount of gas observed can be compared with the expectation resulting from the\nsolar-wind source as an indication of whether\nother sources of gases are present. Contamination\nfrom the lunar module (LM) and the astronaut\nsuits constitutes an additional source, but one that\nshould decrease with time in an identifiable way.\nHowever, in the long run, measurements of actual\ncomposition of the lunar atmosphere should be\nmade with a mass spectrometer to examine constitutents of particularly great interest and to iden-\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n186\n\ntify and discriminate against known contaminants\nfrom the vehicle system.\n\ninstrument Description\nThe essential sensing element of the CCGE\nconsists of a coaxial electrode arrangement as\nshown in figure 9-1. The cathode consists of a\nspool that is surrounded by a cylindrical anode. A\nmagnetic field of approximately 0.090 T (900 G)\nis applied along the axis, and 4500 V are applied\nto the anode. A self-sustained electrical disbharge\ndevelops in the gage in which the electrons remain\nlargely trapped in the magnetic field with enough\n\nelectrometer\n\n-To\n\n4500 V\nFIGURB\n9-1.Sensor in the CCGE.\n\nenergy to ionize any gas particles that they strike.\nThe current of ions collected at the cathode is a\nmeasure of the gas density in the gage.\nThe response of the CCGE in terms of cathode\ncurrent as a function of gas concentration is shown\nin figure 9-2. The CCGE response depends in a\nrather modest degree on the gas composition; thus,\nas long as the gas composition remains unknown,\na fundamental uncertainty remains in the interpretation of the data. It is usual to express the results\nin terms of equivalent nitrogen response (i.e., the\nconcentration of nitrogen that would produce the\nobserved response). The true concentration varies\nfrom this result by a factor that is usually less\nthan 2.\nInstrument temperature was monitored by\nmeans of a sensor on the CCGE. Because no\ntemperature control exists, the expected temperature range is approximately 100 to 400 K.\nThe CCGE was closed with a dust cover that\ndid not constitute a vacuum seal. The cover was\nremoved by command using a squib motor and\nwas then pulled aside by a spring. Because the\nCCGE was not evacuated, adsorbed gases produced an elevated level of response when the gage\nwas +initiallyturned on. However, the baking of\nthe CCGE on the lunar surface at 400 K for more\nthan a week during each lunar day drove the\nadsorbed gases out of the gage.\n\nElecfronic Circuitry\nA description of each of the major CCGE assemblies follows.\n\n10-l~ I\n105\n\nI\n\n106\n\nIlli I\n\n107\n\nI\n\n108\n\nI\n\n109\n\nIIII\n\nio1O\n\nGas concentration, particles/crn3\nFIGURE\n9-2.-Response\n\nof the CCGE.\n\nioll\n\nElectrometer amp2ifier. An autoranging, autozeroing electrometer amplifier monitors current\noutputs from the sensor or from the calibration\ncurrent generators in the lO-\'*- to 10"-A range.\nThe output ranges from -15 mV to -15 V. The\noutput of the electrometer is routed to the analogto-digital converters for conversion. The electrometer consists of a high-gain, low-leakage differential amplifier with switched high-impedance\nfeedback resistors and an autozeroing network.\nThe electrometer operates in three automatically selected overlapping ranges: (1) most\nsensitive, (2) midrange, and ( 3 ) least sensitive.\nRange 1 senses currents from approximately lo-"\n\n187\n\nCOLD-CATHODE-GAGE EXPERIMENT\n\nto 9.3 X 10" A; range 2, currents from approximately 3.3 X lo-" to 3.2X 10-nA; and range 3,\ncurrents from approximately\nto 9.3 X lo-\' A.\n\nPower supply. The 4500-V power supply consists of a regulator, a converter, a voltage-multiplier network, and the associated feedback\nnetwork of a low-voltage power supply. The regulator furnishes approximately 24 V for conversion\nto a 5-kHz squarewave, which is applied to the\nconverter transformer. The output of the converter\ntransformer is applied to a voltage-multiplier network (stacked standard doublers), the output of\nwhich is filtered and applied to the CCGE anode.\nDeployment\n\nThe electronics for the CCGE were contained\nin the suprathermal ion detector experiment\n(SIDE), and the command and data-processing\nsystems of the SIDE also served the CCGE. The\nCCGE was separable from the SIDE package and\nwas connected to it by a cable approximately 1 m\n( 3 ft) long. The experiment was deployed so that\nthe LM descent stage was just outside the CCGE\nfield of view, which looked south toward Fra\nMauro. The CCGE is shown deployed on the\nlunar surface in figure 9-3.\n\nExperiment Results\n\nThe CCGE was turned on at approximately\n23:59 G.m.t. on February 5, 1971. A full-scale\nresponse was indicated until 01:20 G.m.t. on\nFebruary 6, at which time the concentration began\nto decrease.\nBoth the CCGE 4.5-kV and the SIDE 3.5-kV\nhigh-voltage power supplies were turned off at\n01:40 G.m.t. on February 6 after a mode change\noccurred that suggested that arcing might be taking place. The 4.5-kV power supply was activated\nagain at 07:50 G.m.t. on February 6 to observe\nthe LM depressurization before the second period\nof extravehicular activity (EVA). After observation of this event, the voltage was again turned\noff at 08:39 G.m.t., and it remained off until just\nbefore the LM depressurization for housekeeping\nfunctions after the second EVA. The CCGE was\noperated from 13:13 to 13:16 G.m.t. for this\nobservation. No other CCGE operation was attempted until the start of the first lunar night because of the operational constraints on the SIDE\nand CCGE high voltages.\nA plot of density as a function of time during\nthe depressurization for the second EVA is shown\nin figure 9-4, and a similar plot during the venting for disposal of the backpacks following the\nsecond EVA is shown in figure 9-5.

In figure\n9-5, extra peaks are shown that were apparently\ncaused by the venting being interrupted because\nof a loose hose on one of the spacesuits. The two\npeaks at 13:27:30 and 13:28:30 G.m.t. were\ncaused by equipment being thrown from the LM\nand were observed at the time of occurrence while\nthe recorder and television were watched simultaneously at the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center.\nNo obvious explanation exists for the peaks at\n13:26 G.m.t., except that this time was probably\nwhen the LM hatch was opened.\nWhen the high voltage was turned on at the\nstart of the first lunar night on February 19, the\noutput indication of the CCGE electrometer was\nin the low area of range 3. When the CCGE went\nthrough the automatic-calibration cycle, the output indication went to a low value in range 1,\nwhich is the most sensitive range. This occurrence\nwas improperly interpreted as an out-of-strike\ncondition. This improper interpretation was caused\npartially by the density of the lunar atmosphere\nbeing much lower than had been anticipated and\npartially by the lack of opportunity to track the\ndensity downward from the higher values that had\nprevailed earlier.\nThe CCGE was placed in an operational mode\nthat eliminated the calibration cycle and was\n\nforced into range 3 by turning the 4.5-kV power\nsupply off and then back on. This method was\nbelieved to be the only way to prevent the gage\ndischarge from going out of strike, and the indication in range 3 was considered to be proper. As\nmore data were analyzed, it was determined that\nthe range 1 indication was actually correct and\nthat a zero-drift error that is normally corrected\nby an autozeroing during the calibration cycle was\nlarge enough (for the operational mode that was\nselected) to prevent the instrument from switching\nout of range 3. The result of the confusion was a\ndetermination that the CCGE had been operating\ncorrectly only during part of the time from February 19 to March 5.\nThree notable gas events, as shown in figure\n9-6, were observed during operation from February 19 to March 5. At 15:30 G.m.t. on\nFebruary 19, the concentration of the lunar atmosphere was approximately 2 X 1Oj cm-\'. At 22:OO\nG.m.t. on February 20, the CCGE switched into\na proper mode of operation in range 2, with an\nindicated concentration of 2 X loe cm". The first\nevent occurred between these times. After the first\nevent, the density decreased steadily until the second event occurred. The time and magnitude of\nthe first event were not determined because of the\nCCGE being in the improper operational mode\n\n189\n\nCOLD-CATHODE-GAGE EXPERIMENT\n\n2\n\n10 -12\n\n21\n\n02\n\nd7\n\n12\n\n17\n\n22\n\n03\n\n08\n\n13\n\n18\n\nI\n\n23\n\n04\n\n09\n\n14\n\n19\n\n0,O\n\n05\n\n10\n\nFIGURE- 6 . 4 a s concentration detected during the first lunar evening after deployment of\n9\nthe CCGE, showing gas events 1, 2, and 3 (T=110" K ) .\n\nat the time of occurrence. The event apparently\ncaused an increase in concentration between one\nand two orders of magnitude and had a duration\nof between 89 and 11 3 hr.\nThe second and third events occurred at 02:46\nG.m.t. on February 22 and 04:36 G.m.t. on February 23, as shown in figure 9-6. The second\nevent was slightly greater than one order of magnitude and had a duration of approximately 1 hr.\nThe rise time of the event was approximately\n10 sec, as shown in figure 9-7.\nEvent 3, which occurred in range 1, had a rise\ntime of approximately 6 min, and the amplitude\nwas approximately doubled (fig. 9-8). As shown\n\nin figure 9-6, event 3 may have been a double\nevent; however, this observation is not definite,\nand the event will be explored further when the\ndata tapes are available and more data points are\nobtained.

The\nfollowing list illustrates the wide variety of\nphenomena that may be responsible for these\nparticles:\n\nSummary o Observations\nf\n\nIn conjunction with the preceding list of scientific objectives, the following preliminary observations have been noted:\n\n( 1 ) Relatively stable plasma population in the\nmagnetospheric tail including the so-called plasma\nsheet and neutral sheet (ref. 10-1)\n\n(1) Detection of stable, low-energy photoelectron fluxes at the lunar surface\n\n(2) Transient particle fluxes in the magnetospheric tail resulting from such phenomena as\ngeomagnetic substorms and particle-acceleration\nmechanisms similar to those that produce auroras\n(ref. 10-2)\n( 3 ) Plasma in the transition region between\nthe magnetospheric tail and the shock front\n\n(4) The solar wind, and particles resulting\nfrom the interaction between the solar wind and\nthe lunar surface (refs. 10-3 and 10-4)\n\n( 5 ) Solar cosmic rays, those particles thrown\ninto interplanetary space by solar-flare eruptions\n\n(6) Photoelectrons at the lunar surface produced by the interaction of solar photons with\nthe lunar-surface material\n( 7 ) \xe2\x80\x9cArtificial events\xe2\x80\x9d; for example, particles\nproduced by the impact of the lunar module (LM)\n\n(2) Observation of plasma clouds produced by\nthe impact of the Apollo 14 LM ascent stage\n(3) Observations of rapidly fluctuating, lowenergy (50 to 200 ev) electrons in the magnetosheath and magnetospheric tail\n\n(4) Detection of fluxes of medium-energy electrons, with durations of a few minutes to some\ntens of minutes, deep within the magnetospheric\ntail\n\n( 5 ) Observation of electron spectra in the magnetospheric tail remarkably similar to electron\nspectra observed above terrestrial auroras\n( 6 ) Observation of rapid time variations (10\nsec) in solar-wind fluxes observed in interplanetary\nspace\nTheoretical Basis\n\nThe objectives of the CPLEE are to measure\nthe proton and electron fluxes at the lunar surface and to study their energy, angular distribu-\n\nUniversity of Sydney.\nRice University.\nf Principal investigator.\n\n193\n\n194\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\ntions, and time variations. The results of these\nmeasurements will provide information on a variety of particle phenomena, important both in\nthemselves and for their relevance to lunar-surface\nproperties.\nA category of radiation exists that may periodically envelop the Apollo lunar-surface experiments package (ALSEP) at the times of the full\nMoon, when it is in the magnetospheric tail of the\nEarth, which is swept downstream like a comet\ntail by the solar wind. It has been speculated (ref.\n10-2) that the electrons and protons that cause\nauroras when they plunge into the terrestrial atmosphere are accelerated in the magnetospheric\ntail. Indeed, it has been shown (ref. 10-5) that the\nultimate source of auroral particles is the Sun\nand furthermore that an almost-continuous replenishment of the magnetospheric-particle population is necessary to sustain the observed auroral\nfluxes (ref. 10-6). The mechanisms that accelerate\nthese particles to auroral energies are not understood, and simultaneous observations near the\nEarth and near the Moon are essential for detailed study of their general characteristics and\nmorphology.\nThe solar wind may occasionally strike the\nsurface of the Moon. The wind is caused by the\nexpansion into interplanetary space of the very hot\nouter envelope of the Sun. The stream apparently\ncarries energy and perturbations toward the EarthMoon system; consequently, the solar wind may\nbe the source of energy that leads to such terrestriaI phenomena as auroras and Van Allen radiation. For this study, the Moon would serve as an\nexcellent stable observation post in space.\nHowever, apparently the pure interplanetary\nsolar wind does not always hit the lunar surface\n(ref. 10-3). Because the solar wind is supersonic\nand because the Moon is sufEiciently large to prove\nan obstacle to the flow of the wind, it is possible\nthat, at times, there is a standing shock front. To\ndate, the only such phenomenon observed is\ncaused by the terrestrial magnetic field, which\nhollows out a cavity in the solar wind. The detailed\nphysical processes that occur at such shock fronts\nare not understood fully, and they are of considerable fundamental interest in plasma research.\nIf, occasionally, such a shock front exists near the\n\nMoon, the CPLEE will observe the disordered (or\nthermalized) fluxes of electrons and protons that\nshare energy on the downstream side of the shock.\nApparently, the \xe2\x80\x9cshadowing\xe2\x80\x9d of the solar wind\nby the lunar surface, causing a plasma \xe2\x80\x9cvoid\xe2\x80\x9d on\nthe dark side, is the most frequently occurring\nsituation (ref. 10-3).\n\nThe instrument can also measure the lower\nenergy solar cosmic rays occasionally produced\nin solar eruptions or flares. To observe these lowenergy particles, the experimental packages must\nbe placed beyond the reach of the modifying effects\nof an atmosphere and a magnetic field such as\nexists on Earth. The Moon is an excellent platform for such studies because both the atmosphere\nand magnetic field are so relatively negligible.\nThe sunlit lunar surface may be a veritable sea\nof low-energy photoelectrons generated by solar\nf\nphotons striking the surface. I such electrons are\npresent, the CPLEE, with the capability to detect\nelectrons with energies down to 40 eV, will be in\nan excellent position to study them. Studies of any\nsuch photoelectron layer are important in deducing surface properties related to photoemission\nand in gaining indirect information about lunarsurface electric fields.\nObservations of the charged-particle environment of the Moon are of interest also, not merely\nfor its own sake but because such particles affect\nthe lunar environment. They may cause luminescence or coloration effects on the lunar surface.\nThe charged particles may also sweep away a\nlarge proportion of the lunar atmosphere. Furthermore, they constitute a very important proportion\nof the electrical environment, and they may, for\nexample, nullify electrostatic effects that would\notherwise occur on the lunar surface.\nEquipment\nDescription of the lnsfrornenf\n\nThe CPLEE consists of a box supported by\nfour legs. The box contains two similar physical\ncharged-particle analyzers, two different programable high-voltage supplies, twelve 20-bit accumulators, and appropriate conditioning and shifting\ncircuitry. The total weight on Earth is approxi-\n\nCHARGED-PARTICLE LUNAR ENVIRONMENT EXPERIMENT\n\n195\n\nFIGURE\n1O--2.Pchematic sketch of the CPLEE physical\nparticle analyzer, showing the deflection plates and\nchannel electron-multiplier stack.\n\nFIGURE\nlO--1.-The CPLEE deployed on the lunar surface. Photograph illustrates the absence of dust contamination and the east-west alinement of the CPLEE.\n\nmately 2.7 kg (6 lb), and normal power dissipation is 3.0 W rising to approximately 6 W when the\nlunar-night survival heater is on. The CPLEE is\nshown deployed on the lunar surface in figure\n10-1.\nEach physical analyzer contains five C-shaped\nchannel electron multipliers with a nominal aperture of 1 mm each and one helicd channel electron\nmultiplier with a nominal aperture of 8 mm. These\nare shown schematically in figure 10-2 and an\nactual analyzer is shown in figure 10-3.\nThe channel electron multiplier is a hollow glass\ntube, the inside surface of which, when bombarded\nby charged particles, ultraviolet light, etc., is an\nemitter of secondary electrons. In the CPLEE,\nthe aperture of each electron multiplier is operated\nnominally at ground potential (actually at 16 V ,\n)\nwhile a voltage of 2800 or 3200 V (selected by\nground command) is placed on the other (Le.,\nanode) end. Thus, if an incident particle enters\nthe aperture and secondary electrons are produced, these are accelerated and hit the walls to\n\nFIGURE\n10-3 .-The\n\nCPLEE physical particle analyzer.\n\ngenerate more secondary electrons, so that a multiplication to an order of 10\' is achieved by the\ntime the pulse arrives at the anode. After conditioning, pulses from each electron multiplier are\naccumulated in a register for later readout as\ndescribed in the following paragraphs.\nAs shown in figure 10-2, incident particles\nenter an analyzer through a series of slits and then\npass between two deflection plates across which\na voltage can be applied. Thus, at a given deflection voltage, the five small-aperture electron multipliers make a five-point measurement of the\nenergy spectrum of charged particles of a given\npolarity (e.g., electrons), while, simultaneously,\nthe large-aperture electron multiplier makes a\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n196\n\nsingle wideband measurement of particles with\nthe opposite polarity (e.g., protons). The advantages of simultaneously measuring particles of\nopposite polarity and of simultaneous multiplespectral samples are considerable in studies of\nrapidly varying particle fluxes.\nThe CPLEE particle analyzer is quite similar\nto the switched proton electron Channeltron spectrometer (SPECS) (ref. 10-6) and, in fact, the\nSPECS instrument was the prototype of the\nCPLEE anlyzer. The capability of the SPECS,\nand thus of the basic particle analyzer of the\nCPLEE, was demonstrated by a series of sounding-\n\n1I\n\nframe n o . /\nALSEP\n\nCPLEE\nphysical\nanalyzer\n\nI\n\nI 1 \xe2\x80\x99[ I 2\xe2\x80\x99s1 1\nI\n\nl\n\n12\n\n16\n\nAIB AIB AIB A I B\nReadout of\n\nl\n\n2\n4\n\nz;\n\nAIB\n\nAIB\n\nA during B measurements, etc.\n\nDeflection\nvoltage\n\n--\n\n1,-19.2\n\nsec (normal)-I\n\nFIGURE\n10-4.-Deflection-voltage\nstepping sequence of\nthe CPLEE in the automatic mode.

As a consequence, the energy passbands shown in figure 10-5 are sampled. Although\ndata acquired by the six sensors are not transmitted simultaneously, the six sensors are connected to six accumulators for exactly the same\ntime (viz, 1.2 sec) and the contents transferred\nto shift registers for later sequential transmission.\nTwo analyzers, A and B, point in the directions\nshown in figure 10-6. The same deflection voltage\nis applied to each analyzer simultaneously, with\ncounts from 1 .Zsec accumulation time of analyzer\nA being transmitted while counts from analyzer\nB are accumulating. Thus, each voltage is\nnormally on for 2.4 sec with the result that the\ntotal cycle time is 19.2 sec (fig. 10-4), when\nallowance is made for two sample times when the\ndeflection voltage is zero. On one of those two\noccasions, counts are accumulated as usual to\nmeasure background or contaminating radiation.\nOn the other occasion, a pulse generator of about\n375 kHz is connected to the accumulators to\nverify operation.\nThe command link with the ALSEP provides\na variety of options for CPLEE operation.

The sequence can be\nstopped and then the deflection plate supply can\nbe manually stepped to any one of the eight possible levels. This is done to study a particular\nphenomenon (e.g., low-energy electrons) with\nhigher time resolution (2.4sec) . A second set of\ncommands allows the electron-multiplier highvoltage supply to be set at either 2800 or 3200 V.\nThe higher voltage is used in the event the\nelectron-multiplier gains decrease during lunar\noperations. A third pair of commands allows the\nnormal thermd-control mode to be bypassed in\nthe event of failure of the thermostat, thus offering\nmanual control of the heaters.\nThe CPLEE apertures are covered with a dust\ncover to avoid contamination during deployment\nand, particularly, during LM ascent (ref. 10-9).\nThe dust cover was made doubly useful because\na "Ni radioactive source was placed on the underside over each aperture. Thus, the sensors were\nproof calibrated on the Moon, and the data compared with measurements made in the same way\nwith the same system when the unit was last calibrated on Earth.\n\nCalibration of the CPLEE was extensive and\nwill be described briefly in this report. The major\nportion of the calibration was performed with an\nelectron gun that fired a large, uniform beam of\nelectrons of adjustable energy levels, monoenergetic to approximately 2 percent. Under the control of a computer, the instrument was tilted at\nvarious angles to the beam. The computer stored\nthe count rates of each channel at each angle and\nelectron energy level as well as the beam current\nmeasured by use of a Faraday cup. The absolute\ngeometric factors were then computed from the\nseveral million accrued measurements. In addition, the \'?Ni sources were used as broadband\nnear-isotopic electron sources for standard\ncalibrations.\n\nIn practice, the exact passbands were derived,\nrather than the rectangular equivalent passbands\nof figure 10-5. However, the finer details, together\nwith information gained from measuring susceptibility to ultraviolet light and to scattered electrons, can be shown to be negligible for this\npreliminary study.\nDeployment\n\nThe CPLEE was deployed with no dirsculty at\napproximately 18:OO G.m.t. on February 5, 1971,\nLeveling to within 2.5" and east-west alinement\nto within k 2 " were to be accomplished with a\nbubble level and a Sun compass, respectively.\nIt has since been determined by a careful study\nof the lunar photographs and a comparison of\npredicted and actual solar ultraviolet response\nprofiles that the experiment is 1.7" off level, tipped\nto the east, and 1" away from a perfect east-west\nalinement. This error is well within the preflight\nspecifications. Furthermore, the photograph (fig.\n10-1) shows no visible dust accretion on the\nexterior surfaces.\nOperation of the Experiment\n\nThe CPLEE was first commanded on at 19:OO\nG.m.t., February 5, during the iirst period of\nextravehicular activity for a brief functional test\nof 5-min duration. Al data and housekeeping\nl\nchannels were active, and the instrument began\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCLENCE REPORT\n\n198\n\noperation in the proper initial modes (Le., automatic sequencer, on; electron-multiplier voltage\nincrease, off; and automatic thermal control, on).\nA complete instrument checkout procedure was\ninitiated at 04:OO and continued until 06:lO\nG.m.t., February 6. During this period, data from\nthe dust-cover beta sources were accumulated and\ncompared with prelaunch calibrations. A partial\ncomparison is shown in a following section of this\nreport. Also during this period, al command funcl\ntions of the CPLEE were exercised except the\nforced heater mode and dust-cover removal commands. The instrument responded perfectly to all\ncommands. After the checkout procedure, the\nCPLEE was commanded to the standby mode to\nawait LM ascent.\nFollowing LM ascent, the CPLEE was commanded on at 19: 10 G.m.t. and the dust cover was\nsuccessfully removed at 19: 30 G.m.t., February\n6. The CPLEE immediately began returning data\non charged-particle fluxes in the magnetosphere.\nThe instrument temperatures were carefully\nand continuously monitored for 45 days after\ndeployment. It was found that the temperature\nrange was nominal, with the internal electronics\ntemperature ranging from 58" C at lunar noon to\n-24" C during lunar night. The total lunar eclipse\nof February 10 offered an excellent opportunity\n\nto determine various thermal parameters and to\ntest the capab&ty of the CPLEE to survive extreme thermal shocks. A plot of the physicalanalyzer temperature during the eclipse is shown\nin figure 90-7. The maximum thermal shock\noccurred after umbra exit, with a temperature\nchange rate of 25" C/hr. Also from this figure, it\nis possible to derive a thermal time constant of\napproximately 1.9 hr. The CPLEE suffered no\nill effects from this period of rapid temperature\nchanges.\nThe command capability of the CPLEE was\nused extensively during the 45-day real-time support period to optimize scientific return from the\ninstrument. Alternate 1-hr periods of manual operation at the -35-V step and automatic operation have been used to concentrate on rapid\ntemporal variations in low-energy electrons.\nSimilarly, alternate periods of 350-V manual and\nautomatic operation have been used to focus on\nrapid changes in magnetopause ions and the solar\nwind. In fact, the manual operation capability and\nthe attendant 2.4-sec sampling interval made possible the detection of phenomena that would have\nbeen impossible to detect otherwise because of\nsampling problems and aliasing. Most of the decisions concerning operational modes were based\non viewing the real-time data stream.\nTo date, the CPLEE has operated continuously\nwith all high voltages on except for one brief\nperiod of approximately 15 sec when it was commanded to standby, and then back to on, to restore\nautomatic thermal Control at the termination of the\nlirst lunar night. No evidence of high-voltage discharge or corona has been observed.\n\nResults\n\n*\n%\n\nE -10\n-20\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\n04:OO 05:OO 06:OO 07:OO 08:OO 09:OO 1O:OO 1O 1200 13:OO\n1O\n:\nG.m.t., February 10, h t m i n\n\nThe following paragraphs are a detailed discussion of the scientific phenomena recorded by\nthe CPLEE and listed in the "Summary of Observations."

The tests\nwere conducted before the complete laboratory\ncalibration, immediately after the laboratory calibration, and after lunar deployment. These tests\nspan an interval of approximately 15 months.\nThe counting rates tabulated are for deflection\nvoltages of -3500 V for channels 1 to 5 and\n3500 V for channel 6, when the channels were\nsensitive to electrons with energies between 5 and\n50 keV. Variations in analyzer A are not more\nthan 30 percent, with 4 to 6 percent being typical.\nIn analyzer B, there was a general trend of gain\nloss between the precalibration and postcalibration\ntests of approximately 20 percent, but there was a\npartial recovery between the postcalibration test\nand the postdeployment test. This effect is attributed to the well-known characteristic of temporary electron-multiplier fatigue resulting from\nexposure to high fluxes (e.g., during the calibration) and later recovery. This phenomenon has\nbeen documented (ref. 10-10). These beta-source\ntests show that no major changes occurred in the\nelectron-multiplier characteristics between calibration and deployment, and they verified the operation of CPLEE. The small variations in gain observed are to be expected and are tolerable.\n\nelectrons when the lunar surface, in the vicinity\nof the ALSEP, is illuminated by the Sun.

As would be expected,\nthe spectrum is quite steep, as the CPLEE was\nobserving essentially a high-energy and possible\nnonthermal tail of an electron distribution with an\naverage energy of approximately 2 eV. In fact,\nthe high-energy tail that was measured was almost\ncertainly nonthermal, because the spectrum between 40 and 100 eV can be represented by an\nequation of the form\n\nwhere j ( E ) is electron flux in units of electrons/\ncm2-sec*sr.eVa n d i o i s thefluxat E = 4 0 eV.\nClearly, this does not agree with a simple maxwellian distribution at low energies with kT\n2 eV.\nTwo possible explanations for this discrepancy\nexist: (1) Some process is acting to accelerate\npart of the photoelectron gas; (2) the CPLEE\nitself is at a positive potential with respect to the\nsurrounding lunar-surface average potential. The\nsecond explanation is entirely possible in view of\nthe facts that the CPLEE is well insulated from\nthe lunar surface by fiber-glass legs and that the\nphotoemissive properties of the CPLEE and of\nthe lunar surface are almost certainly different. It\nis hoped that this question will be resolved with\ndetailed studies of these photoelectron fluxes,\nespecially during periods of terminator crossings\nand the eclipse.\n\n10\n\n-\n\n10\n\n>\n9.\xe2\x80\x99\nVI\nL\nV\na\nVI\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c0\n$\n-.\n..\nVI\nc\n\ne\n\nc\nW\nV\n\nW\n\n10\n\nIt\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n40\n\n80\n\n1M\n\n10\n6\n\nI\n\nm\n\nI\n\nI\n\n240\n\n280\n\nElectron energy, eV\nFIGURE\n10-10.-Energy spectrum of photoelectrons with\nenergies between 40 and 200 eV.

It would be impossible for a single-point\nultraviolet source (e.g., the Sun) to produce such\nsimilar counting rates in both analyzers.\nLM Impact Event\n\nOn February 7, the Apollo LM ascent stage\nimpacted the lunar surface 66 km west of the\n\n201\n\nCPLEE. The terminal mass and velocity were\n2303 kg and 1.68 km/sec, respectively, resdthg\nin an impact energy of 3.25 X 10\xe2\x80\x9d J (see. 6).\nThe LM contained approximately 180 kg of\nvolatile propellants, primarily dimethylhydrazine\nfuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer.

(This conclusion is supported by the\nobservation that these ambient fluxes disappeared\nentirely during the total lunar eclipse (figs. 10-8\nand 10-9) that occurred a few days later on\nFebruary 10.) The counting rates increased by\na factor of about 4 approximately 40 sec after\nLM impact and then reverted to ambient levels\nfor a few seconds. However, 48 sec after LM\nimpact, the ion electron counting rates increased\nvery rapidly by a factor of up to 40 as the plasma\ncloud enveloped the CPLEE. A second plasma\ncloud passed the CPLEE a few seconds later, as\nshown by the second large peak. On the assumption that the plasma clouds traveled essentially in\na linear path between the impact point and the\nCPLEE, the average velocity calculated was 1.0\nkm/sec; and the horizontal dimensions were 14\nand 7 km for the first and second clouds, respectively.\n\nFIGURE 1&13.-Counting rates of channels 3 and 6 of\nanalyzer B at -35 V, measuring 65-eV negative particles and 70-eV ions, respectively, showing the particle\nfluxes resulting from LM impact.\n\nThe same data for analyzer B oriented 60"\nfrom the vertical toward the lunar west (i.e.,\ntoward the impact point) are shown in figure\n10-13. By comparing figures 10-12 and 10-13,\nit can be noted that the flux enhancements were\nin\nessentially si~ultaneous the two directions, but\nthat the positive-ion flux measured by analyzer A\nwas five times higher than the flux measured by\nanalyzer B . On the other hand, the negativeparticle flux measured by analyzer A was only\none-third as great as the negative-particle flux\nmeasured by analyzer B .\nThe detailed characteristics of the plasma clouds\nare shown in figure 10-14, which is an expandedtime-scale plot of the negative-particle fluxes in\nfive energy ranges and the ion flux in a single\nenergy range measured by analyzer A . The plot\nshows clearly that the negative-particle enhancement was confined to energies less than 100 eV,\nbecause the 200-eV flux was essentially constant\nthroughout the event. Furthermore, the spectrum\nof negative particles during the enhancement is\nquite different from the background electron\nspectrum. This point is illustrated further in figure\n10-1 5 , which shows the negative-particle spectra\nfor 00:42:33 G.m.t.

In the period\nof approximately 2 days following the impact\nevent, several rapid enhancements in the lowenergy electron fluxes (by a factor of up to 50)\nwere observed. However, these other enhancements were not correlated with positive-ion-flux\nincrease; and, in fact, the event referred to is the\nonly such example of perfectly correlated positiveand negative-particle enhancements recorded to\ndate. In addition, careful monitoring before the\nLM impact revealed that the fluxes were relatively\nstable, constant to within a factor of 2 over periods of a few minutes. This observation lends\n\nFurther confidence in the interpretation that\nthe flux enhancements were artificially impact\nproduced rather than of natural origin is gained by\nnoting that, although no such plasma clouds have\npreviously been detected resulting from impact\nevents, positive-ion clouds have been detected by\nthe Apollo 12 suprathermal ion detector experiment. These positive-ion clouds were interpreted\nas resulting from the Apollo 13 and 14 SIVB\nimpacts.\'\nJ. W. Freeman, Jr.; H. K. Hills; and M. A.

An average\ncloud velocity of 1 km/sec has been previously\nnoted, and it is of interest to compare this with\nparticle velocities in the cloud. Some assumptions\nmust, of course, be made as to the ion species\npresent. Considering that the most likely source\nof ions was the LM propellants, an average ion\nmass of 25 is estimated. I it is assumed that the\nf\nnegative particles detected were electrons and that\nthe positive particles had an average mass of 25,\nthis assumption yields velocities (E = 50 ev) of\n4000 km/sec and 20 km/sec, respectively. The\ncharged-particle energy densities based upon the\nions actually measured are calculated to be\n5.6 X 1C"\' erg/cm*, assuming the ions were protons, and 28.0 X lo-\'\' erg/cm*, assuming an\naverage ion mass of 25. These are lower limits,\nbecause positive ions were measured in only a\nsingle energy range, and an overall ion-energy\nspectrum is required to make a more exact calculation. The magnetic-field energy density at the\nlunar surface, based on Apollo 12 lunar-surface-\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nmagnetometer measurements (ref. 10-1 1) of a\nsteady 35y field is 50 X 10" erg/cm*; hence, the\nparticle energy density appears to be at least\ncomparable to and possibly dominant over the\nmagnetic-field energy density. This conclusion,\nhowever, may be modified by the Apollo 14 lunar\nportable magnetometer observations of lunarsurface fields of 40 to 100 gammas at two distinct sites (sec. 13). It should also be noted that the\nsolar-wind energy density is 80 X lo-" erg/cm*.\nTherefore, the conclusion can be made that\nthe LM impact resulted in the production of two\nannular plasma clouds that contained negative\nparticles and ions with energies up to 100 eV.\nThe particles traveled across the lunar surface\nwith a velocity of approximately 1 km/sec. No\nspeculation has been made as to the mechanisms\nresponsible for production of these clouds, but\nthe simultaneous arrival of both positive- and\nnegative-charge species is impossible to reconcile\nwith a simple model of photodissociation and ionization and subsequent acceleration by a static\nelectric field.\n\nCHARGED-PARTICLE LUNAR ENVIRONMENI\' EXPERIMENT\n\nThe fact that the electron and ionic components\nwere detected simultaneously offers a unique\nproblem; because, if one assumes that the particles\nwere energized at the instant of impact, a mechanism must be found that is able to hold the cloud\ntogether, in view of the fact that measured ion\nvelocities exceed the cloud velocity by an order of\nmagnitude. This fact in itself argues against ambipolar diffusion. Processes such as charge exchange,\nscattering, and wave-particle interactions can also\nbe rejected by appealing to considerations based\non the size of the clouds (10 km). The only remaining possibility is magnetic confinement, or a\nprocess whereby the local magnetic field confines\nthe particles in circular orbits. There is, however,\na criticism of the hypothesis that magnetic confinement can explain the observation. The cyclotron radii of the particles must be no greater than\nthe dimension of the plasma cloud. The cyclotron\nradius of a 50-eV mass-25 ion in a 1007 magnetic\nfield is 50 km, or a factor of approximately 3 to\n6 times larger than the inferred cloud dimensions.\nIt thus appears that a simple model of the\nparticles being energized at the instant of impact\nis untenable not in itself, but because a mechanism\nto contain the plasma after energization is not\nreadily evident and, in fact, may not exist. The\nalternate conclusion is that the impact produced\nexpanding gas clouds, and the particles in these\ngas clouds were then ionized by any one of several\nmeans (e.g., photoionization) and subsequently\naccelerated by a continuously or erratically active\nacceleration mechanism. The solar-magnetospheric\n(SM) coordinates of the CPLEE at the time of\nimpact were Ysh1=34RE, ZsM=2 1RE, and solar\nelevation angle =30\xc2\xb0, where RE is Earth radius.\n(The solar-magnetospheric coordinate system is\nbased on the Earth-Sun line (X-axis) and the\nmagnetic dipole axis of the Earth. The Z-axis is\nperpendicular to the Earth-Sun line and in the\nplane formed by the Earth-Sun line and the Earth\nmagnetic dipole axis; the Y-axis completes the\nright-handed coordinate system.) Hence, it is\nhighly likely that the solar wind had direct access\nto the lunar surface at this time. Noting the energy\ndensities of the solar wind and the plasma cloud\nparticles, the solar wind is energetically capable\nof being the energy source. Whether any such\nmechanism can work is unknown at this time,\n\n205\n\nalthough calculations have indicated that the solar\nwind can interact with a neutral gas through means\nother than simple particle-particle collisions (ref.\n10-12).\nIn summary, the impact-event data apparently\nindicate a situation in which the gas cloud, solar\nwind, and local magnetic field are all interacting,\noffering a unique and fascinating problem in\nplasma physics.\nLow-Energy Electron Fluctuations\n\nIn addition to the stable low-energy photoelectron population that the CPLEE records\nwhenever the lunar surface in the vicinity of the\nCPLEE is illuminated, the CPLEE also observes\nrapidly varying fluxes of low-energy electrons of\nmagnetospheric origin, with intensities large\nenough to be detected above the photoelectron\nbackground. Examples of these fluxes are shown\nin figure 10-16, wherein the counting rates of\nchannel 3 (65-eV electrons) and channel 5\n(200-eV electrons) are plotted for a brief time\nsegment. At approximately 21 :20 G.m.t., February 7, the solar magnetospheric coordinates of\n=\n=\nthe CPLEE were YSM 24RE and ZSM 14RE,\nlocating the instrument within the magnetospheric\ntail near the boundary. The instrument was in the\nmanual mode, and hence the individual measurements are 2.4 sec apart. The flux enhancements\nrange up to a factor of 10 above the background\nlevel on time scales on the order of a few seconds.\nAt first glance, the enhancements in the two\nenergy ranges appear to be well correlated, but a\ncloser examination of the figure reveals temporal\ndispersions in the enhancements. To illustrate this\npoint more clearly, the data for the period\n21:20:07 to 21:20:41 G.m.t. have been plotted\nin a special manner in figure 10-17: a log-log plot\nof the counting rates in the two energy channels\nwas made with the higher energy channel on the\nvertical axis and the lower energy channel on the\nhorizontal axis. Each pair of count rates from the\ntwo channels is represented by a single point, and\na vector is drawn between successive points in the\ndirection of increasing time. On this type of plot,\nif the enhancements are perfectly correlated, all\nvectors will lie along a constant slope, the magnitude of which is a function of the relative enhancements.

An examination of figure 10-17\nshows that, in general, for the longest vectors, the\nconstant-slope rule is followed; but that on smaller\nscales (e.g., points 1 to 5 and 9 to 12), considerable deviations from the constant-slope rule exist.\nFor these events, the vectors rotate clockwise, indicating that the higher energy electrons lead the\nlower energy electrons.\nAlthough plots such as these are indicative in\nnature, they do show the general character of the\nenhancements and suggest that low-energy electrons are being accelerated or modulated by processes relatively near the Moon. An approximate\nestimate of the distance can be obtained by considering the velocity difference at the two energies\nand the dispersion times in the enhancements (0\nsec to approximately 2 sec), resulting in a maxi-\n\nmum distance of some 20000 km, or 3RE. An\nextensive cross-correlation analysis will be necessary to refine these calculations, but the preliminary studies indicate the presence of local\n(with reference to the Moon) processes capable\nof modulating or accelerating low-energy electron\nfluxes.\nMedium-Energy Electron Event\n\nAt approximately 18:30 G.m.t. on March 10,\ndistinct enhancements in medium-energy (approximately 1-keV) electron fluxes were observed\nin both analyzers A and B.

Perfect temporal simultaneity would result in all vectors\nlying parallel to a line of constant slope. The marked\ndeviations from this rule should be noted.\n\nthat the CPLEE was in the manual mode at -35\n\nV at these times, and the data gap at 21:OO was\ndue to a temporary shutdown of the data display\nsystem at the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center.\nIt is seen from the figure that the event is characterized by erratic, relatively short-duration flux\nenhancements between 18:30 and 21:OO G.m.t.;\nby a period of stable high fluxes between 21 :10\nand 22:OO G.m.t.; and by a return to erratic enhancements between 22:00 and 23 :00 G.m.t. The\nmagnetic-activity index K p was 3 or less on March\n10, and there were no enhancements in the solar\nX-ray flux. Thus, this event apparently is characteristic of the quiet-time magnetosphere, and the\nelectrons are truly magnetospheric in origin.\nOn the basis of the particle measurements\nalone, it is difficult to resolve the question of\nwhether the enhancements are of a spatial or\ntemporal nature; that is, whether the effects of the\nCPLEE moving in and out of stable spatial region\nor regions of flux enhancements are being recorded or whether a large-scale temporal event\nis being recorded.

Of\nparticular interest is the fact that the event was\nseen only during the period when ZgM\nwas near\nthe maximum positive excursion of 6RE. This is\nhighly suggestive, though certainly not conclusive\nproof, that the CPLEE was sampling a stable\n=\nspatial structure located at ZSM RE and YSM\n= l l R E to 13RE.

These enhancements typically had durations of a few minutes. The energy spectrum of\none such enhancement at 23: 16 G.m.t., February\n7, is shown in figure 10-2 1. As in most electron\nspectra observed when the lunar surface is\nilluminated, the spectrum between 40 and 100 eV\nis dominated by the photoelectron continuum.\nHowever, in the higher energy ranges, a doublepeak structure with a low-energy peak in the range\n300 to 500 eV and a high-energy peak at 5 to\n6 keV can be seen. It is interesting to compare\nthese spectra with spectra observed above a terrestrial aurora.

(It should be\nrecalled that the basic particle detectors of both\nthe SPECS and the CPLEE are very similar.)\nThe photoelectron continuum is, of course,\nabsent from these auroral spectra; but, aside from\nthat, a remarkable similarity between the electron\nfluxes recorded by the CPLEE and the auroral\nelectrons is readily evident. The double-peak\nstructure in both spectra, the low-energy peaks in\nthe 100- to 500-eV range, and the high-energy\npeaks at 5 to 6 keV are particularly noteworthy.\nThe flux levels in the auroral spectrum are within\na factor of 5 of the flux levels measured by the\nCPLEE (fig. 10-21). Furthermore, while particles measured above an aurora tend to be more\nor less isotropically distributed about the field\nlines, the magnetic-tail particles observed by the\nCPLEE were strongly peaked along the field lines.\nThis-deduction was made an $he basis-;sf the\nobservation that no flux enhancements were seen\nin analyzer B, and that the angles between the\nmagnetic field and the directions of analyzers A\nand B were approximately 20" and 80",respectively. Particles energized near the Earth and subsequently traveling back into the tail would be\nsharply peaked along field lines at lunar distances\n=\naccording to the first invariant sina OL/B constant, where OL is the particle pitch angle and B is\nthe local magnetic-field magnitude.\nConsequently, the process that produces energetic particles above a terrestrial aurora may well\nresult in the appearance of similar particles in the\nmagnetospheric tail. A definite resolution of this\nquestion awaits further study of the data and\ncorrelation between the CPLEE data and Earthbased measurements of auroral activity. However,\nthis preliminary indication of auroral particles at\nlarge distances from the Earth in the magnetospheric tail implies that some auroral-zone magnetic-field lines are linked with field lines stretching far into the tail and, hence, give information\non the general topology of the magnetosphere.\n\nRapid Temporal Sofar-Wind Variations\nWhen the Moon crosses from the magnetospheric-tail regions into interplanetary space on\nthe dawn side of the magnetosphere, the CPLEE\nanalyzer B is pointed toward the Sun and, hence,\n\ne\n\n210\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n106\n\ni?\n:\n*\n\nio5\n\n(From ref.10-1)\n\n(From ref. 10-1)\n\n0."\n\n\\e\\\\:\n\n* * b\n:\n*)\\\n\n.\n,\n\n*\\\n\nio4\n\n:\\,g\n\ne\n\\\n\nY\n\\\n:\n\nio3\n\\\n00\n\n\'1\n\\\n\nTime = 56 to 75 sec\nAltitude = 430 km\n\n3\\ *\n\nTime = 164 to 179 sec\nAltitude = 660 km\n\n* \\\n\n102\n\n\\\n\n1\n.\n\\\n\\\n\ni\n\n4\n\n$ 101\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\n,I\n-\n\nz\n\n1\n\n3 106\nI\n=\n\nf\n0\n0\n\n.p,\n\\.\n\n(From ref.10-1)\n\n105\n\n(From ref. 10-1)\n\nI :\n\n14\n0\n\nt\n\n*\n\n\\\n,\n\'\n\n103\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\\\n\nTime = 464 to 483 sec\nAltitude = 750 km\n\nlo2\n\n\\\n\nI\n\nb\n\nTime = 531 to 543 sec\nAltitude = 675 km\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n!\n\n\\\n*\\\n\\\n\\*\n\nk\n*\\\n\ni\n\n0\n\n10\'\n\nI\n\n.01\n\n.10\n\nI\n1.0\n\nI\n\n10\n\n1\n\n.01\n100\nEnergy, keV\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n.10\n\n1.0\n\n10\n\n100\n\nFIGURE\n10-22.-Electron spectra measured above a terrestrial aurora by a device similar to the\nCPLEE on a sounding rocket probe (ref. 10-1).

Data from\nchannel 5 of analyzer B at 350 V, sensitive to ions with energies between 1.5 and 3 keV, are\nplotted with a time resolution of 2.4 sec.\n\nis able to detect solar-wind fluxes striking the\nMoon. Some of the detailed characteristics of solar\nwind at the lunar surface have been reported\npreviously (ref. 10-4), and the CPLEE measurements appear to be in genera1 agreement with the\nmeasurements of average solar-wind parameters\nby the Apollo 12 solar-wind spectrometer. The\nunique rapid-sampling capability of the CPLEE\nhas been used to study rapid temporal variations\nin the solar wind. The sampling interval of the\nCPLEE (2.4 sec) is compared with those of other\nexperiments designed to measure solar-wind fluxes,\nnotably the Vela 3A and 3B detectors with\nsampling intervals of 256 sec in reference 10-15\n\nand with the solar-wind spectrometer sampling\ninterval of 28.1 sec in reference 10-4.\nAn example of rapid solar-wind variations is\nshown in figure 10-23. At 20:45 G.m.t. on February 16, the solar-magnetospheric coordinates of\nthe CPLEE were Y S M -67RB and Z , =\n=\n,\n-32RH, placing the instrument well away from\nthe magnetospheric-tail boundary. The angle between the center of the detector field of view and\nthe CPLEE-Sun line was 2". The CPLEE data\nshowed the counting rate was concentrated in\nchannel 5 at 350-V deflection (the channel sensitive to ions with energies between 1.5 and 3.0 keV,\nexactly what would be expected if the instrument\n\n212\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nwere viewing the direct solar wind). The ratio of\nthe counting rates of this channel in analyzer B\nto the corresponding channel in analyzer A was\non the order of 1000:1, indicating the extreme\ndirectionality of the flux.\nVariations in the solar-wind flux of up to a\nfactor of 10 on time scales as short as 5 sec are\nshown in figure 10-23. A comparison of the\ncyclotron radius of a 1.5-keV proton in the 57\ninterplanetary field (1000 km) with the linear\nvelocity of the Moon (1 km/sec) indicates that\nf\nthese variations are indeed temporal in nature. I\nthe variations were spatial in origin, variations in\nthe flux of a factor of 10 over distances as short\nas 1/200 of a cyclotron radius would be required.\nThis situation is highly unlikely.\nAn isolated feature of the data has not been\nselected, and the indication is that these rapid\ntemporal variations are a persistent feature of the\nsolar-wind flux. Lacking a detailed analysis of the\nfrequency spectra of these variations, their origin\ncan only be speculated upon at this time. It is\nnoted, however, that the observed frequency of\nvariations (approximately 0.2 Hz) is similar to\nthe expected observed frequency of magnetoacoustic waves (low-frequency waves that propagate in a magnetized plasma such as the solar\nwind), the wavelength of which is on the order of\nan ion-cyclotron radius, as seen by a stationary\nobserver (approximately 0.5 Hz) . This suggests\nthat the variations seen are due to magnetoacoustic waves modulating the particle fluxes, and these\nwaves may be generated at the shock surface between the solar wind and the magnetospheric tail.\nSummary\n\nDuring the first month of operation, the CPLEE\nhas detected particle fluxes at the lunar surface\nresulting from a wide range of lunar-surface,\nmagnetospheric, and interplanetary phenomena.\nPreliminary data analysis has revealed the presence of a lunar photoelectron layer, an indication\nof modulation or acceleration of low-energy electrons in the vicinity of the Moon, penetration of\nauroral particles to lunar distances in the magnetospheric tail, detection of electron fluxes in the\nmagnetospheric tail possibly associated with the\nneutral sheet, strong modulations of solar-wind\n\nfluxes, and the appearance of ions and electrons\nor negative ions with energies up to 100 eV associated with the LM impact. Many of these discoveries were possible only because of the rapid\nsampling capability of the CPLEE and its ability\nto measure particles of both charge signs over a\nwide energy and dynamic range, coupled with\nthe real-time data display and command capability\nof the ALSEP.\nThese preliminary findings have resulted from\nanalysis of \xe2\x80\x9cquick-look\xe2\x80\x9d hardcopy data. Other\nphenomena are apparent in the data, but adequate\ncharacterization and description must await detailed computer analysis of the 200 measurements/\nmin being returned by the CPLEE.\nReferences\n10-1.

Wilkinsund\n\nConcept of the Experiment\n\nDuring the Apollo 14 mission, a second laser\nranging retroreflector (LRRR) was deployed on\nthe lunar surface. The Apollo 11 and 14 retroreflector packages permit ground-based stations\nto conduct short-pulse laser ranging to these\narrays on the lunar surface. An observation program of several years\' duration that results in m\nextended sequence of high-precision Earth-Moon\ndistance measurements will provide data from\nwhich a variety of information about the EarthMoon system can be derived (refs. 11-1 to 11-7).\nAn obvious immediate use o these data will be\nf\nto define more precisely the motion of the Moon\nin its orbit. Another experimental result will be\nthe measurement of the lunar librations-the\nirregular motions of the Moon about its center.\nMost of the apparent librations are caused by the\nellipticity of the lunar orbit and the inclination of\nlunar axis of rotation, but residual motions are\npresent because the mass of the Moon is not evenly\ndistributed. The Apollo 11 retroreflector site and\nthe Fra Mauro Apollo 14 site, though both near\nthe equator, are well separated from one another\nand consequently will yield high-quality informaWesleyan University.\nUniversity of Maryland.\nJoint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics.\nPrinceton University.\ne University of California at Los Angeles.\nCouncil on Environmental Quality.\nUniversity of Texas at Austin.\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\' University of Texas, McDonald Observatory.\nPrincipal investigator.\na\n\n+\n\ntion concerning the librations of the Moon in longitude. The ability to separate the librations in\nlongitude from the center of mass motion of the\nMoon will be of significant value in the analysis of\nthe lunar-range results.\nIt has not yet been possible to conduct a full calculation of the lunar librations with the accuracy\nneeded for the laser ranging experiment. A third\nU.S. retroreflector is to be deployed as a part of\nthe Apollo 15 mission in the area near Rima\nHadley. The three Apollo arrays, well separated\nin longitude and latitude, will permit a complete\ngeometrical separation of the lunar librations.\nAlready, the existence of two arrays should make\nit possible to see a phase shift in the 3-yr physical\nlibrations, which Eckhardt has recently pointed\nout (ref. 11-8) should exist unless the Q of the\nMoon is very high.\nAnother major objective of this experiment is\nto learn more about the Earth. Current theories\nsuggest that the surface of the Earth is subdivided\ninto a number of large plates that move with\nrespect to one another. These movements are\nbelieved to explain continental drift. As an example, the Pacific plate is thought to be moving\ntoward Japan at the rate of about 10 cm/yr. After\nobservation stations are established in Hawaii and\nJapan, the lunar-distance measurements will give\nthe longitudes of these stations with such high\naccuracy that this expected motion shodd be\nobservable within 2 or 3 yr.\nData obtained from the lunar-distance measurements will also determine the position of the North\nPole with an accuracy of approximately 15 cm,\n\n215\n\n216\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nwhich is five or 10 times more accurate than that\npresently known by current methods. The position of the pole moves around the surface of the\nEarth in a rather complicated manner. It may\ntravel nearly 70 m along a rather elliptical path\nduring any year. The excitation mechanism for\nthis polar wobble is still much in debate. It cannot\nbe conclusively stated whether the mechanism is\natmospheric mass shifts, variations in the coupling\nof the core and the mantle, or mass shifts in the\ncrust. The last hypothesis has been suggested by a\ncorrelation of observed polar shifts with major\nearthquakes, and hence better measurements may\nlead to a more complete understanding of earthquake phenomena.\nLunar-distance measurements will also permit\nmore accurate determinations of the Earth rotational rate than has previously been possible. And,\nfinally, the sensitivity afforded by the presence of\nthese retroreflecting arrays on the lunar surface\nwill make it possible to use the Moon again as a\ntesting ground for gravitational theories. Many\nobservers are interested in discovering whether the\ntensor theory of gravity is sufficient or whether a\nscalar component is necessary, as has been suggested. A definitive test of the hypotheses may be\nobtained by monitoring the motion of the Moon.\nAdditionally, the possibility exists of seeing some\nvery small but important effects in the motion of\nthe Moon that are predicted by the general theory\nof relativity.\n\nu\nFIGURE\n11-1.-The\n\nLRRR in a stowed configuration.\n\nFIGURE\n11-2.--The\n\nLRRR in a deployed Configuration.\n\nProperties of the LRRR\nThe Apollo 14 LRRR (figs. 11-1 and 11-2)\nis a wholly passive device containing an array of\n100 small, fused-silica corner cubes, each 3.8\ncm in diameter. The Apollo 14 LRRR was deployed during the first period of extravehicular\nactivity approximately 30 m west of the central\nstation; thus, the array was placed approximately\n200 m west of the lunar module (LM) . Leveling\nand alinement to point the normal-to-the-array\nface toward the center of the Earth libration pattern was accomplished with no difficulty (fig.\n11-3). Each corner cube in the array has the\nproperty of reflecting light parallel to the incident direction; that is, a light beam incident on a\ncorner cube is internally reflected in sequence\n\nFIGURE\n11-3.-Photograph\narray.\n\nof the deployed Apollo 14\n\n217\n\nLASER RANGING RETROREFLECTOR\n\nreflection\n\nReflected ray\nFIGURE\n11-4.-Typical\n\nlaser-ray path in retroreflector.\n\nfrom the three back faces and then returned along\na path parallel to the incident beam (fig. 11-4).\nThis parallelism between the reflected and incident\nbeams insures that the reflected laser pulse will\nreturn to the vicinity of origin on the Earth.\nThe Apollo 14 LRRR is almost identical to the\nApollo 11 array placed on the Moon in July 1969\n(ref. 11-9). The basic array design is a result\nof the need to meet and simultaneously satisfy\nmany different and sometimes conflicting requirements. In an ideal environment, the choice would\nbe relatively simple because, for a given geometry\nand allowable weight (payload), the return signal\nis maximized by making a single diffraction-limited\nretroreflector as large as weight restrictions and\nfabrication techniques will permit. Two aspects\nof the practical problem, however, vitiate this conclusion: ( 1) a displacement occurs in the returned\nlaser beam because of the relative velocity between\nthe Moon and the laser transmitter (velocity aberration) and (2) a wide lunar-temperature variation occurs from full Moon to new Moon, as well\nas the fact that the retroreflector is exposed essentially half the time to an energy input from direct\nsunlight. The velocity aberration that displaces\nthe center of the returned diffraction pattern between 1.5 and 2 km limits the diameter of the\ndiffraction-limited retroreflector that can be used\nto approximately 12 cm unless two telescopes\nspatially separated from one another are used, one\nfor transmitting and the other for receiving. In\n\nthe situation in which laser light is transmitted and\nreceived at the same location, analysis shows that\nthe loss in efficiency that results from using a\nlarge number of smaller diameter corners is almost\nexactly compensated as a result of the increased\ndiffraction spreading of each corner. This has the\neffect of placing the transmitter-receiver site\nhigher up the side of the returned diffraction\npattern. These two effects result in essentially the\nsame optical efficiency for a given payload weight\nfor corners ranging from approximately 3.8 to 12\ncm in diameter. With the use of a corner smaller\nthan 3.8 cm, an overall loss in efficiency is experienced because further diffraction spreading is\nineffective; at that size, the single transmitting and\nreceiving site is already, for all practical purposes,\nat the center or peak of the returned diffraction\npattern. The observations that dictated the choice\nof 3.8 cm as the diameter of the corners were as\nfollows: ( 1 ) using this smallest still-efficient size\nmade it possible to minimize the thermal gradients\nthat would distort the individual cube-corner diffraction patterns and (2) with this size corner, one\ncould expect to achieve essentially diffractionlimited performance throughout the lunar day as\nwell as during lunar night. The temperature gradients in the individual corner cubes are further\nminimized by recessing each reflector by half its\ndiameter in a circular socket (fig. 11-5). Furthermore, each reflector is tab mounted between two\nTeflon rings to afford all possible thermal insulation. The mechanical mounting structure serves\nAluminum\nretainer\nring.,,\n\nc\n>\n\nstructure------\n\nFIGURE\n11-.5.-Retroreflector\n\nc , R i v e t\n\n3.8-cmdiameter\nfused quartz,\ntrtolerance\non mounting\nalinement\nmounting.\n\n218\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nalso to provide passive thermal control by means\nof surface properties. A transparent polyester\ncover assembly protected the array from dust\nduring storage, transportation, handling, and flight.\nThe Apollo 14 crew removed this cover at the\ntime of deployment.\nThe Apollo 14 LRRR differs from the earlier\nApollo 1 1 design in only two main aspects:\n(1) The array cavity design was changed to\nincrease the half-angle taper from 1.5" to 6" to\ndecrease the obscuration and thereby increase the\narray optical efficiency approximately 20 to 30\npercent for off-axis Earth positions.\n(2) The supporting pallet is lighter and somewhat simpler in design.\nSuccessful range measurements to the Apollo\n14 array were first made from the McDonald\nObservatory of the University of Texas on February 5, 1971, the day on which the LRRR was\ndeployed by the crew. Ranging subsequent to LM\nliftoff indicated that no serious degradation of\nthe retroreflectors has occurred as a result of the\nascent-stage engine burn. Signal strengths compare\nfavorably with the levels obtained over the past\nyear from the Apollo 11 array.\nGround-Station Operation\n\nAt present, range measurement to the two\nretroreflector packages at nearly all phases of the\nMoon are being conducted at the McDonald\nObservatory with NASA support. Return signals\nfrom the Apollo 1 1 array have also been obtained by the Pic du Midi Observatory in France\nand the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories Lunar Laser Observatory near Tucson,\nAriz. Recent reports suggest that the ranging\ngroup in Japan has also had some initial success.\nIt is hoped that several other lunar ranging stations will be in operation within the next year or\ntwo, including stations in Hawaii, Russia, and the\nSouthern Hemisphere.\nA line drawing of the laser ranging station at\nthe McDonald Observatory is shown in figure\n11-6. A schematic drawing of the telescope\nn\nmatching optics and guider is shown i figure\n11-7.

One observing period is near the time of\nmeridian transit for the Moon, and the others are\n3 or 4 hr earlier and later. Several runs of approximately 50 shots each are normally fired during\neach observing period.\nDuring the past year, considerable effort has\nbeen successfully exerted in the areas of equipment and calibration procedures.\nThe ruby laser system being used at present\ngives 3 4 pulses with a repetition rate of one\npulse every 3 sec. The total pulse length between\nthe 10-percent intensity points is 4 nsec. The rootmean-square variation in the observed transit\ntime, because of the laser pulse length and the\njitter in the photomultiplier receiving the returned\nsignal, is 2 nsec. The present overall accuracy of\nthe measured transit time is f 1 nsec (equivalent\nto an error of approximately 2 3 0 cm in distance\nmeasurements). Improvement to less than 1 nsec\nis expected with further refinements in the calibration procedures. Recent progress in lasers per-\n\nranging detector package.\n\nmits the use of pulses with a 0.2-nsec length. This\nnarrow pulse capability should prove extremely\nvaluable in achieving the scientific goals of the\nexperiment. The present detector-package arrangement is shown diagrammatically in figure\n11-8.\nWith data from two or more well-located observing stations, the lunar range can be corrected\naccurately for the effects of polar motion and\nfluctuations in the Earth rotational rate. The uncertainty in range, as a result of the atmosphere\nin general, will be less than 1 cm for zenith angles\nof up to 70".\nSummary\n\nThe placing of the Apollo 11 retroreflector array\non the Moon in July 1969, together with successful\ndeployment of the Apollo 14 array, has resulted in\na dramatic change in man\'s ability to measure the\nEarth-Moon distance.

Meister\n\nMeasurements of the relative ion abundances\nin the solar wind give information on the dynamics\nof the solar corona and constitute an important\nmethod for investigating elemental and isotopic\nabundances in the outer convective zone of the\nSun. Furthermore, solar-wind-abundance data are\nessential for a detailed interpretation of the trapped\ngases in meteorites and lunar material. Based on\nthese investigations, the evolution of the lunar surface and a possible transient lunar atmosphere can\nbe studied. Noble-gas studies of the solar wind\nmay also help in tracing the evolution of the terrestrial atmosphere.\nIt has been known for several years that the\nhelium/hydrogen (He/H) ratio in the solar wind\nis highly variable and ranges from less than 0.01\nto 0.25, with an average of approximately 0.04\n(refs. 12-1 to 12-5). During periods of low\nsolar-wind-ion temperature, the elements oxygen,\nsilicon, and iron have been measured by means\nof the high-resolution electrostatic analyzers on\nboard the Vela satellites and, in some cases, even\n"He has been detected (refs. 12-6 and 12-7). In\nthe Apollo program, a different technique is used\nfor studying elemental and isotopic abundances\nin the solar wind.\nDuring the Apollo 11, 12, and 14 missions,\naluminum foils were deployed at the lunar surface and used as targets for collecting solar-wind\nions. The foils were returned to Earth, and the\nimplanted solar-wind particles are being analyzed\nin the laboratory. The Apollo 11 and 12 solarwind composition (SWC) experiments have so\na\n\nfar yielded absolute solar-wind fluxes of \'He, \'He,\nneon-20 ("Ne), and "Ne (refs. 12-8 and 12-9).\nIn the case of the Apollo 12 experiment, an approximate figure for the abundance of "Ne was\nalso obtained. In this report, preliminary results of\nthe first analyses on sections of the Apollo 14 foil\nare presented.\nProton detectors and magnetometers have been\nused to establish that the Moon behaves like a\npassive obstacle to the solar wind, and no evidence of a lunar bow shock has been found (refs.\n12-10 to 12-13).\' Thus, during the normal lunar\nday, the solar-wind particles strike the lunar surface with essentially unchanged direction and\nenergy, except perhaps in a few places where local\nmagnetic fields are unusually high (ref. 12-14).\nIt was, in fact, shown from the Apollo 11 and 12\nSWC experiment data that He reaches the lunar\nsurface in an undisturbed, highly directional flow\n(refs. 12-8 and 12-9). The Apollo 12 solar-wind\nspectrometer has recorded the plasma flow that\narrives at the Apollo 12 lunar-surface experiments\npackage site as a function of phase of the lunar\nday. The result is that, most of the time, the\nplasma flux is not affected by the proximity of the\nsurface of the M0on.l Thus, the expectation is that\nexperiments deployed on the lunar surface will\nyield solar-wind-abundance data that are valid for\nthe undisturbed solar wind.\n\nD.

The foil was positioned\nperpendicular to the solar rays in the azimuthal\ndirection (fig. 12-1), exposed for 21 hr, and returned to Earth. Laboratory experiments have\ndetermined that solar-wind ions arriving with an\nenergy of approximately 1 keV/nucleon penetrate\napproximately lo+ cm into the foil (ref. 12-15),\nand a large and well-known fraction is firmly\ntrapped (refs. 12-16 and 12-17). In the laboratory, the returned foil is analyzed for trapped\nsolar-wind noble-gas atoms. Parts of the foil are\nmelted in ultra-high-vacuum systems, and the\nnoble-gas atoms of solar-wind origin thus released\nare analyzed with mass spectrometers for elemental abundance and isotopic composition.\nFurther details of the principle and the procedures\nof this experiment have been discussed elsewhere\n(refs. 12-16, 12-18, and 12-19).\nIn addition to the solar-wind investigations, a\nsearch will be made for radon (Rn) emanating\nfrom the Moon by using a small portion of the\n\nApollo 14 SWC foil. When Rn decays in the very\nthin lunar atmosphere, the recoil energy of the\ndaughter nuclides is sufEicient that any such atom\nstriking the foil becomes firmly trapped. In the\nfoil, the Rn decay product lead-210 will be\nsearched for and, if found, its concentration will\nbe determined to derive the ambient Rn concentration in the lunar atmosphere.\nInstrumentation and Lunar-Surface Operation\n\nThe experiment hardware was similar to the\nhardware used on the Apollo 11 and 12 missions\n(ref. 12-19). The experiment consisted of a\nmetallic telescopic pole approximately 4 cm in\ndiameter and 38 cm in length when collapsed. In\nthe stowed position, the foil was enclosed in the\ntubing and rolled up on a spring-driven reel. The\ninstrument weighed 430 g. When extended on the\nlunar surface, the pole was approximately 1.5 m\nlong and a 30- by 125-cm foil area was exposed.\nOnly the foil assembly was recovered at the end\nof the lunar-exposure period; it was rolled on the\nspring-driven reel and returned to Earth. The instrument is shown deployed on the lunar surface\nat the Apollo 14 landing site in figure 12-1. For\nthe Apollo 14 SWC instrument, the reel handle\nwas color coded to give the exact angular position\nduring exposure of the reel and the portion of\nfoil rolled around it. Detailed analyses of this portion of the foil are intended to yield the angular\ndistribution of the arriving solar-wind ions. After\nevaluation of a number of Apollo 14 photographs,\nit was concluded that the foil was standing vertically (within a few degrees) at the lunar surface.\nAfter retrieval, the return unit was placed in a\nspecial Teflon bag and returned to Earth in the\ninterim stowage assembly. In the Lunar Receiving\nLaboratory (LRL) quarantine area, the foil was\nremoved from the Teflon bag and found to be in\ngood condition. No dust was detected on the foil\nwith the unaided eye. The foil and reel were subsequently placed in a container and stored in the\nLRL crew reception area during the quarantine\nperiod.\nPreliminary ResuIts\n\nFIGURE\n12-l.-Apollo 14 SWC experiment deployed on\nthe lunar surface (AS14-64-9199).\n\nThe Apollo 14 foil was made available for\nanalysis after the lifting of the quarantine in early\n\n223\n\nSOLAR-WIND COMPOSITION EXPERIMENT\n\nTABLE\n12-1.

For the initial analyses, five small pieces\nfrom the upper part of the foil were decontaminated by means of the ultrasonic treatments that\nhad proven effective during the Apollo 11 and 12\nSWC experiment analyses. The results of these\nfirst measurements are presented in table 12-1.\nThe data given should be considered as preliminary, because recalibration of the gas standards and reevaluation of the mass-spectrometer\ncharts could lead to somewhat different final results. Along with these measurements on the flight\nfoil, numerous pieces that had been cut from the\nApollo 14 foil before flight for the purpose of\nnoble-gas blank measurements were analyzed. The\nblanks that had been determined in this way were\nsubtracted from the noble-gas concentrations\nmeasured in the pieces of the flight foil, and the\nsolar-wind-particle concentrations presented in\ntable 12-1 were obtained. The foil blanks for He\nand Ne were 0.1 and 7 percent, respectively, relative to the solar-wind-particle content.\nThe oxide layer on the back side was removed\nfrom two of the investigated pieces of the Apollo\n14 foil before analysis. The expectation was that\nthis procedure would reduce a possible residualdust contamination. Examinations of contaminated portions of the Apollo 12 foil have shown\nthat, after ultrasonic treatment, 50 to 80 percent\nof the residual dust was located on the back side\nof the foil.\nFor the He and Ne isotopes, the results from\nthe five foil pieces are in good agreement. This\nagreement is further evidence that the He and Ne\ndata given in table 12-1 are not appreciably\naff "ccted by a residual-dust contamination. Further\n\nanalyses will be conducted to substantiate this\nconclusion. In particular, measurements on a\nshielded portion of the flight foil and on the section of the foil that had been exposed on the back\nside of the reel (facing away from the Sun) will\nbe used to demonstrate the absence of significant\nlunar-dust contamination.\nNeon-21 has been detected in the five foil\npieces listed in table 12-1. Within the limits of\nerror, the "Ne data agree with the results obtained\nfrom the Apollo 12 SWC experiment (ref. 12-9).\nBy using larger portions of the foil, it is expected\nthat the "Ne abundance can be determined from\nthe Apollo 14 SWC experiment with good accuracy. To obtain the \'He/"Ne ratio in the solar\nwind, the data given in table 12-1 must be corrected for the difference in the He- and Ne-trapping efficiencies. A preliminary \'He/"Ne value of\n550 has been obtained.\nThe argon (Ar) content of the solar wind has\nbeen determined for the first time. For "Ar and\n"Ar, the foil blank is actually higher than the\nsolar-wind-particle content. However, in this case,\nthe blank can be uniquely determined far each\nanalyzed foil piece from the "Ar content. Virtually\nall the "Ar that was detected in the foil is of atmospheric origin, because the "Ar/"Ar ratio of 295\nin terrestrial Ar is much larger than the solar-wind\n40Ar/sAr ratio, which is estimated to be smaller\nthan unity (refs. 12-20 and 12-21). The "Ar/"Ar\nratios that were actually measured in the foil\npieces range from 240 to 260 (Le., between 10\nand 20 percent of the "Ar was of solar-wind\norigin). ,The solar-wind "Ar concentrations obtained after blank correction are used to calcu-\n\n224\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nlate the We/"Ar ratios given in table 12-1.\nArgon-38 has also been detected in the five foil\npieces that have been analyzed. Values between\n4.2 and 5.9 for the "Ar-"Ar ratio were obtained.\nThis ratio will be determined more accurately by\nanalysis of the Ar contained in larger pieces of\nthe foil.\nThe *Ne/"Ar ratios in the five foil pieces agree\nwithin -I- 10 percent. This variation corresponds\napproximately to the analytical errors. It should\nbe noted in particular that the Ar concentration\nis not reduced by the removal of the oxide layer\non the back side of the foil. On the basis of this\nobservation, it is estimated that a possible\nresidual-dust contamination has not greatly affected the five *We/"Ar ratios given in table 12-1.\nBy taking the average of the measured *Ne/"&\nratios for the five foil pieces, an estimated value\nof 37" is obtained for the "Ne/"Ar ratio in the\n-5\nsolar wind during the Apollo 14 foil exposure.\nThis value is much higher than the *Ne/"Ar\nratios (between 5 and 10) found in unseparated\nlunar dust. In ilmenite samples that have been\nseparated from the Apollo 11 lunar-fines material, "Ne/"Ar ratios between 25 and 33 have been\nfound (ref. 12-21). The ilmenite values are fairly\nclose to the values obtained from the Apollo 14\nSWC experiment and indicate that the composition of the trapped solar-wind particles in ilmenite\nis much less affected by diffusion or other processes than is the composition in the bulk material.\nThe "Ne/"& ratio of 37 is considerably higher\nthan solar-corona values and cosmic-abundance\nestimates. Measurements on forbidden lines and\nultraviolet analysis (ref. 12-22) indicate that a\n"Ne/"Ar ratio of 3 would be expected for the\nsolar corona. Cameron (ref. 12-23) estimates a\n"Ne/"& abundance ratio of 11 for the solar system, and the earlier Suess-Urey abundance compilation predicted a higher value of 67 for the\n"Ne/"Ar ratio (ref. 12-24). The results from the\nApollo 14 SWC experiment seem to indicate that\nan intermediate value for the "Ne/"Ar ratio\nmight be appropriate. However, in the solar-windacceleration process, fractionation between "Ne\nand "Ar might occur. Both "Ne and the much\nheavier "Ar are most likely eightfold charged in\nthe solar wind. Separation processes caused by\nquasi-static electromagnetic fields or dynamical\n\nfriction could thus deplete "Ar in the solar wind.*\nThe average 4Heflux during the Apollo 14 exposure period can be calculated by using the data\ngiven in table 12-1. The trapping probabilities of\nthe foil for noble-gas ions depend only slightly on\nenergy in the general solar-wind-velocity region.\nFor He with a velocity of approximately 300\nkm/sec, the trapping probability is 89+2 percent\nfor normal incidence and approximately 9 percent\nless for an incidence angle of 65".\nThe angular distribution and the average angle\nof incidence on the Apollo 14 foil have not yet\nbeen determined. Thus, for the purpose of this\nreport, the average angle of incidence is estimated.\nThe average solar elevation during the foil exposure was 19". By taking into account the effects of\naberration and corotation, an angle of incidence\non the foil of 68" is obtained for the undisturbed\nsolar wind. At the present time, it is not known\nwhether the Moon had already passed through the\nshockfront of the Earth during the Apollo 14 foil\nexposure. I such were the case, the angle of incif\ndence would be further lowered by 5" to 7" (ref.\n12-25). The assumption is therefore made for\nthis report that the average angle of incidence of\nthe solar-wind particles on the foil was approximately 65". With this assumption, the \'He flux\nduring the Apollo 14 SWC foil exposure can be\ncalculated and is given in table 12-11, together\nwith the "He fluxes previously determined for the\nApollo 11 and 12 exposure periods (refs. 12-8\nand 12-9).\nThe flux obtained for the Apollo 14 exposure\nperiod is definitely lower than the flux determined\nduring the Apollo 12 mission. However, the\nHe/Ne and \'He/\'He ratios are closer to the results of the Apollo 12 SWC experiment than to\nthose of the Apollo 11 mission. It will be interesting to compare the Apollo 14 SWC experiment\ndata with proton fluxes measured simultaneously\nby the Apollo 12 solar-wind spectrometer or by\ninstrumentation on unmanned spacecraft to determine whether the flux for all ion species was gene r d y low during the Apollo 14 exposure time,\nor whether the heavier ions were all depleted\nrelative to H by a similar factor.\nJ.

The LPM recorded steady magnetic\nfields of 103+5 gammas and 43+6 gammas at\ntwo sites separated by 1.12 km. These measurements showed that the unexpectedly high 38gamma steady field measured at the Apollo 12\nsite 180 km away (ref. 13-1) was not unique.\nIndeed, these measurements and studies of lunar\nsamples 2,3 (refs. 13-2 to 13-5) and lunarorbiting Explorer 35 data (ref. 13-6) indicate\nthat much of the lunar-surface material was magnetized at some prior time in lunar history. These\ndata can be used to gain information concerning\npresent magnetic and structural properties of the\nlocal region as well as the thermal and magnetic\nhistories of the area.\nBackground and Theory\n\nof space, and forces associated with these fields\nare very important on a cosmological scale. In\nthis solar systerh, strong magnetic fields associated\nwith sunspot regions extend far enough to affect\nradio reception and auroral activity on the Earth.\nThe dipolar field of the Earth acts as a shield\nagainst the hot solar plasma by deflecting it around\nthe terrestrial sphere.

The Earth surface field near\nthe Equator is approximately 30 000 gammas, and\nthe fields measured at three lunar-surface sites\naverage about 60 gammas. The sources of these\nfields are associated with the intrinsic physical\nproperties of materials or moving electrical\ncharges.\nMagnetic fields associated with the Moon have\nbeen found to be much more important to lunar\nstudies than had been anticipated before the Apollo\nlunar-landing missions. The inductive response of\nthe lunar interior to time-dependent solar-magnetic\nfields transported past the Moon permits the\npresent electromagnetic and thermal properties of\nthe lunar interior to be studied (refs. 13-10 and\n13-1 1) . Present and future Apollo missions will\nyield information about the past extrinsic and\nintrinsic magnetic fields and help clarify major\nevents in lunar history. Past extrinsic fields will\nhave been influential during lunar formation, and\nthe study of the resultant remanence should yield\ninformation about ancient solar and terrestrial\nfields. Intrinsic fields should yield information concerning the history of lunar internal temperature,\nrotation, volcanism, and tectonic processes.\nDuring the last decade, many investigators (refs.\n13-12 to 13-16) conducted experiments to determine the magnetic field associated with the\nMoon. These experiments, conducted aboard\nlunar-orbiting and flyby spacecraft, yielded no\ndirect measurement of an intrinsic magnetic field.\nOne of the lunar-orbiting experiments, Explorer\n35, aided directly in the LPM experiment. During\nthe second period of astronaut extravehicular activity (EVA), the Explorer 35 recorded the timeindependent ambient magnetic field caused by\nexternal sources (fig. 13-2). The Explorer 35\nmeasurements, made simultaneously with the LPM\nmeasurements, were later vectorially subtracted\nfrom the LPM data.\nBefore the ApoIIo 14 mission, the measurements\nmade by the Explorer 35 and other lunar-orbiting\nand flyby spacecraft were an aid in establishing\na maximum limit of 4 gammas for an assumed\nintrinsic global magnetic field.

This was the first\ndirect surface measurement of a magnetic field\nintrinsic to an extraterrestrial planetary-sized body.\nThe magnetic field is probably due to magnetized material that acquired remanence during a\nlunar epoch involving an inducing field much\n8\nlarger ( z ~ 1 0gammas) than presently exists at\nthe Moon. This conclusion is consistent with the\nhigh remanent magnetization found in lunar\nsamples.\nDiscovery of the unexpectedly high steady field\nat the Apollo 12 site resulted in the concept of\nthe Apollo 14 LPM experiment. This instrument\nwas designed to make multiple measurements of\nthe steady (time-independent) magnetic field during the astronauts\' traverse at their landing site.\nThe entire project from inception to data return\nrequired slightly more than 1 yr. The effort was\nrewarded by the measurement at Fra Mauro of a\n103-gamma field-approximately 25 times greater\nthan had been predicted only 15 months before.\n\n229\n\nLUNAR PORTABLE MAGNETOMETER EXPERIMENT\n\nEquipment Description\n\nThe LPM was designed as a totally self-contained, portable experiment package. During transit from the Earth to the Moon, the LPM was\nstowed and attached to the scientific equipment\nbay of the lunar module (LM) ;and, on the lunar\nsurface, the LPM was carried on the modularized\nequipment transporter (MET) (fig. 13-3 (a) ) .\nIn the deployed configuration (fig. 13-3 (b) ) ,\nthree orthogonal fluxgate sensors are mounted on\ntop of a tripod. This sensor-equipped tripod is\nconnected by a 15-m-long ribbon cable to the\nelectronics box that contains a battery pack, electronics package, and three milliammeters. (A list\nof pertinent LPM characteristics is given in table\n13-1.)\nFluxgate Sensor\n\nThe fluxgate sensor, shown schematically in\nfigure 13-4, records the vector components of the\nmagnetic field. Three fluxgate sensors (refs. 13-17\nand 13-18) are orthogonally mounted in the\nsensor block shown in figure 13-1. Each sensor\nweighs 18 g and uses 15 mW of power during\noperation. A sensor consists of a flattened toroidal\ncore of Permalloy that is driven to saturation by\na square wave at a frequency of fo=7250 Hz.\nThis constant-voltage square wave drives the core\nto saturation during alternate half-cycles and\nmodulates the permeability at twice the drive frequency.

This net flux is the superposition of the flux\nfrom the drive winding and the ambient magnetic\nfield. The signal generated in the sense winding\nat the second harmonic of the drive signal will be\namplitude modulated at a magnitude proportional\nto the ambient magnetic field. The phase of this\nsecond harmonic signal, with respect to the drive\nwaveform, indicates the polarity of the magnetic\nfield. The sensor electronics amplify and filter the\n2fo sense-winding signal and synchronously d e\nmodulate it to derive a voltage proportional to\nthe ambient magnetic field. After demodulation,\nthe resulting signal is amplified and used to drive\nthe feedback winding to null out the ambient field\nwithin the sensor. Operating at null increases\nthermal stability by making the circuit independent\nof core-permeability variations with temperature.\nThe sensor block, mounted on the top of a\ntripod, is positioned 75 cm above the lunar surface.\nThe tripod assembly consists of a latching device\n\nElectronics Subsystem\n\nThe magnetometer electronics are self-contained\nwith a set of mercury cells for power and three\nmilliammeters for visual readout of the magneticfield components. A block diagram of the instrument is shown in figure 13-5. The sensors are\ndriven into saturation by a 7.25-kHz square wave\ngenerated by a frequency-divided Colpitts oscillator operating at 29 kHz. The oscillator also provides a 14.5-kHz pulse for demodulation of the\nsecond harmonic signal from the sense windings.\nThe amplifier-demodulator is a narrowband amp&\nfier with 80-dB gain at 14.5 kHz. The amplifier\noutput is synchronously demodulated, producing\na direct-current (dc) output voltage proportional\nto the amplitude of the ambient magnetic field.\nThis demodulated output is used to drive the feedback winding of the sensor to operate the sensor\nat null conditions. The demodulated output from\neach channel also drives a panel meter.

The instrument has an overall\nlow-pass filter frequency response with a 3-dB\npoint at 0.05 Hz. The meters also have a range\nswitch connected to the scaling resistors to permit\nfull-scale deflection for either t 5 0 gammas or\nf100 gammas with reading-resolution capabilities\nof 2 1 and r t 2 gammas, respectively.\nExterior surfaces of the instrument were designed so that the temperatures of all components\nwould be maintained between 0" and 50" C for\nSun-elevation angles between 7" and 30". The\ndesired effective optical absorptance and emittance\nof the instrument were achieved by coating the\nsurface areas with appropriate ratios of electrodeposited gold and white thermal paint. The\ntemperature of the electronics box is measured by\nvisually observing the darkening of temperaturesensitive decals that monitor temperatures in increments between 100" and 290" F.\n\nSensor offsets of vector magnetometers are inherently sensitive to environmental change; thus,\na surface measurement of offsets is required.

Both crewmembers remove the\nLPM mounting pallet from the LM and install\nthe magnetometer on the MET. The MET is then\ntransported a minimum of 100 m from the LM\nto eliminate the LM as an artificial field source.\nA measurement sequence is conducted as follows.\nLeaving the electronics box on the MET, the\nastronaut deploys the sensor-tripod assembly and\nlevels and alines the sensor block a minimum of\n11 m from the MET. He returns to the MET, sets\nthe range switch at either 50 or 100 gammas,\nthen reads the meters in sequence and verbally\nrelays the data to Earth. After all readings are\ntaken, the astronaut reels up the cable and stows\nthe sensor-tripod assembly.\nAt the first site only, two sets of additional\nreadings are taken with the sensor block rotated\nfirst 180" about a horizontal axis, then 180"\nabout a vertical axis.

Sites\nA and 6\xe2\x80\x99 are separated by 1.12 km (fig. 13-6(b) ),\nand the linear gradient is calculated to be 54 e 7\ngammas/km. This value is less than the gradient\nupper limit determined for the Apollo 12 site 180\nkm away. At the Apollo 12 site, the steady field\nis measured to be 38 t 3 gammas and the gradient\nupper limit is 133 gammas/km (ref. 13-1 ) These\nvalues are shown for reference in figure 13-7 and\ntable 13-11.\n\n.\n\nDiscussion\nThe two magnetic-field measurements at the\nApollo 14 site have shown that the unexpectedly\nhigh field measured at the Apollo 12 site is not\na feature confined to one site on the Moon. These\nthree magnetometer measurement sites, separated\nby distances of from 1 to 180 km, and the high\nremanence found in the samples436\nreturned from\nthe Apollo 1 1 and 12 sites (refs. 13-2 to 13-5),\nseparated by 1400 km, experimentally show that\nthe Moon has been magnetized in these widely\nseparated regions. It is quite possible that thousands of local surface regions of magnetized concentrations (magcons) may exist (ref. 13-19),\nand reexamination of the Explorer 35 magnetometer and plasma data indicates that several magnetized nonmare areas exist on both the near and\n\xe2\x80\x98G.

These analyses\ngive evidence that much of the lunar-surface material has been magnetized-perhaps even a crustal\nshell around the entire Moon.\nNo obvious mechanism for such large-scale\nmagnetization of surface materials exists at present.\nMagnetization of the Apollo 11 and 12 samples\nwould have required an external field greater than\nlo3 gammas (ref. 13-5). Ambient fields of this\nmagnitude have not been measured in space near\nthe Moon; the largest measured so far are transient\nfields of a magnitude of approximately loa\ngammas; these transient fields last only a few\nminutes (ref. 13-20).\nSources of the Sfeady Field\n\nThe similarities between the Apollo 12 and 14\nfield measurements (viz, all vectors are pointed\ndown and toward the south and have magnitudes\nthat correspond to within a factor of 3 ) suggest\nthat the two Apollo 14 sites and possibly the\nApollo 12 site are located above a near-surface\nslab of material that was uniformly magnetized at\none time. Subsequently, the magnetization in the\nslab was altered by IocaI processes, such as tectonic activity or fracturing and shock demagnetization from meteorite impacts. This latter process is\ngraphically illustrated in figure 13-8.\nThe Apollo 12 and 14 steady magnetic fields\ncould also originate in surface or subsurface dipolar sources, such as meteoroid fragments or ore\nbodies. Properties of such a source assumed for\nthe Apollo 12 field have been discussed in a\nprevious work (ref. 13-1); a similar analysis will\nbe performed for the Apollo 14 fields.\nNumerous other source models exist that could\n\nFIGURE\n13-8.---Conceptual diagram showing disruption of a previously uniformly magnetized\nsubsurface layer by meteoroid impact. The vectors M represent the direction and magnitude\nof remanent magnetization i the layer.\nn\n\nLUNAR PORTABLE MAGNETOMETER EXPERIMENT\n\nbe postdated for the Apollo 12 and 14 fields.\nOne possibility is that the region was subjected\nto a uniform magnetic field but that various materials with differing coercivities were magnetized\nto different strengths. Another model might involve a slow variation in the direction of the\nambient field, causing regions that passed through\nthe Curie temperature (ref. 13-21) at different\ntimes to be magnetized in different directions.\nModels for Magnetizing\n\nlunar\n\nSteady-Field Sources\n\nThe discovery of magnetic sources on the lunar\nsurface has given strong evidence that, at one\ntime in the lunar past, ambient fields much stronger\nthan at present existed over much or all of the\nlunar surface. Perhaps the Moon has taken a\nmagnetic snapshot of an early evolutionary phase\nof the solar system.\nPossible origins of the ancient ambient field\ncould have been external to the Moon (Sun or\nEarth), internal to the Moon (dynamo or thermoelectric currents), or due to induction (eddy curMagnetizing field\nResultant lunar\nremanent rnaqnetization\n\nt\n\nFIGURE\n13-9.-Possible\nmagnetic events in lunar history\nas models for mignetization of near-surface regions of\nthe Moon.

A few possible models\nare discussed briefly, the k s t two of which are\nillustrated in figure 13-9.\nSolar field. In this model (fig. 13-9 (a) ) , the\nSun generates a magnetic field, stronger than\npresently exists, which magnetizes the lunar material. The model requires a solar field of constant\ndirection with respect to the solar and lunar spin\naxes (e.g., solar dipole moment vector pointed\nout of the solar ecliptic plane) rather than the\npresent-day sector-structure geometry.\nTerrestrial field. In this case, the Earth\npossesses a larger field than in the past (not indicated by paleomagnetic studies), or the Moon has\nan orbit much closer to the Earth (fig. 13-9 (a) ) .\nFor a terrestrial field of present-day magnitude,\nthe Moon would have had to approach to within\n2 to 3 Earth radii RE (close to the Roche limit\n(ref. 13-22)) to be subjected to a lO\'-gamma\nfield.\nLunar internal dynamo field. An internal lunar\ndynamo model (fig. 13-9(b)) requires both a\nhot core and a sufficient spin rate at the time the\nsurface material cools below the Curie temperature. Past mechanisms for cooling the lunar\ninterior and slowing the spin rate to the present\nvalue are also necessary to the dynamo model.\n\nThermoelectric current field. According to this\nmodel, large areas of the Moon were covered at\none time by hot lava flows; the temperature gradient between surface and subsurface material induced thermoelectric currents across the interface.\nThe magnetic field associated with this current\nmagnetized the surface material as it cooled below\nthe Curie temperature. It should be kept in mind\nthat these currents would be radial; thus the associated fields would be tangent to the surface and,\ntherefore, would not tend to induce a radial component of magnetization.\nMagnetosheath induction of eddy currents. As\nthe Moon passes through the magnetosheath of the\nEarth during each lunation, it experiences fields\nthat have a preferred direction and are stronger in\nmagnitude than those encountered in the freestreaming solar wind. Repeated passage through\nthe sheath causes an average magnetization to be\ninduced in the direction of flow. For this model,\nthe ancient solar field would have had a geometry\n\n236\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nother than the present-day sector structure, because the field reversals across the sector boundary\nwould have tended to average out the magnetizing\nfield over many lunar revolutions.\nSolar-wind v X B induced currents. The solar\nwind transports magnetic fields past the Moon at\nvelocities v of approximately 400 km/sec; the\ncorresponding v X B electric field causes currents\nto flow along paths of high electric conductivity\n(refs. 13-23 to 13-25) such as molten mare\nregions. The fields associated with these currents\nmagnetize these materials as they cool below the\nCurie temperature. Because this induction mechanism has the strongest influence while the hot\nregion is sunlit, an average preferred direction is\nassociated with v. The v X B induction model\nalso requires some solar-field geometry other than\nthe present-day sector structure.\nPreferential selection of any one of the possible models is difEcult because available magnetic\ndata represent only a small fraction of the lunar\nsurface.

The similarities of magnitudes and directions of the two Apollo 14 measurements and the one Apollo 12 steady-field\nmeasurement give preference to the latter model.\nReferences\n13-1.\n\n13-2.\n\n13-3.\n\n13-4.\n\n13-5.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Apollo 14 LPM measurements have allowed calculation of vector magnetic fields at two\nFra Mauro sites:\n(1) Site A: 103+5 gammas, directed 64"\ndown from the horizontal and azimuthally 39"\nclockwise from due east (fig. 13-7 (b) )\n(2) Site C\': 4 3 2 6 gammas, directed 22" down\nfrom the horizontal and azimuthally 152" clockwise from due east (fig. 13-7(b))\nThese sites are separated by a distance of 1.12 km,\nindicating a 54-gamma/km linear surface-field\ngradient along a line between the two sites. The\ndata show that local magnetization is not confined\nto the Apollo 12 site but extends over at least a\n180-km region of the Moon and possibly over\nmost of the lunar surface.\nThe steady fields could be due to a variety of\ntypes of sources (e.g., a distant dipole or an extended near-surface platelike region that was\noriginally uniformly magnetized but has subsequently been altered by some mechanism such as\n\n13-6.\n\n13-7.\n\n13-8.\n\n13-9.\n\n13-10.\n\n13-11.\n\nDYAL, PALMER; PARKIN, CURTIS, w.;AND\nSONETT,CHARLES\nP.: Apollo 12 Magnetometer: Measurement of a Steady Magnetic Field\non the Surface of the Moon.

Gold a\n\nCloseup photographs of soil and rock on the\nlunar surface were obtained with the Apollo lunarsurface closeup camera (ALSCC) (fig. 14-1).\nThe ALSCC stereoscopic camera contains an internal strobe light and an external sundial that\ncan be read in real time for postmission orientation of photographs. The ALSCC is capable of\nphotographing an area 72 by 82.8 mm and of\nresolving objects as small as 0.085 mm in diameter. Built under contract to the NASA Manned\nSpacecraft Center, the ALSCC was used during\nthe Apollo 11 and 12 missions (refs. 14-1 to\n14-4).\nDuring the Apollo 14 mission, 17.5 stereopairs\nwere obtained of various surfaces (table 14-1).\nThe stereopairs include views of the tracks of the\nmodularized equipment transporter (MET) , bootprints, undisturbed lunar soil, the surface of a\nrock partially obscured by soil, and samples of\nthermal coatings taken in support of the thermal\ndegradation sqmples (TDS) experiment.\nAll the photographs were taken by the commander during the second traverse. The first four\nstereopairs were taken at a location midway between the lunar module (LM) and station A of\nthe traverse (fig. 3-1, sec. 3 ) , while the crew\npaused to check their route. The next 11 stereopairs were obtained in the vicinity of station A.\nOne stereopair may have been taken at either\nstation A or B2; and the last 1.5 stereopairs were\nprobably obtained near the LM at the end of the\ntraverse. Although photography at other locations\nalong the traverse had been planned, no additional\nphotographs could be taken because of a shortage\nof time.\nste in^ the ~~~u~ 11\n12\nmost of\nthe closeup stereoscopic photographs were ob-\n\nFIGURE .-ALSCC.\n14-1\n\ntained near the LM, where the surfaces may have\nbeen affected by the engine exhaust of the LM\nduring the landing.

The crew reported that the MET did not\nproduce a significant "rooster tail" when pulled\nacross the lunar surface and that the depth of the\ntracks varied from 1 to 2 cm, which is consistent\nwith the applied loads and the previous estimates\nof the bearing properties of the lunar soil. An\nillustration of how the fine-grained material produces a precise imprint from the smooth surface\nof the wheel and its slightly raised midline is\nshown in figure 14-2. The compaction of the soil\nin the track results in a drastic change in the\nphotometric properties of the soil. (This phenomenon is also evident in some Hasselblad photographs.) The compacted soil appeared to crack\nalong lines that are similar to those of brittle\nfracture.\nThe MET track shown in figure 14-3 evidently\nwas made in soil firmer than the soil shown in\nfigure 14-2. The track appears narrower, indicat-\n\ning less sinkage, and fine cracks, perpendicular to\nthe direction of motion, are evident. A small white\nrock, in the upper left comer of the photograph,\nwas probably pushed into the lunar soil by the\nMET tire. The indentation in the upper right\n\nFIGUREP2.-The MET track (AS14-77-1 0357).

The undisturbed ground to the\nsides of the track appears to have some fine-scale\nstructure similar to that seen on the pictures of\nundisturbed ground.\nBootprints\n\nIn cross section, the boot treads are trapezoidal\nin shape and 4.6 mm deep. Standing on one foot,\nan astronaut applies a pressure of approximately\n\nFIGURE\nlU.-Bootprint\n\n(AS14-77-10359).\n\n0.7 N/cmz on the lunar surface. This pressure\ngenerally results in a sinkage of approximately 2\ncm-except on the rims of small, fresh craterswhere bootprints as deep as 10 cm have been\nobserved.\nThe lunar soil is able to retain the shape of the\nbootprint tread (figs. 14-4 to 14-6), including\nthe nearly vertical wall, because the soil is slightly\ncohesive. The relatively smooth surface over most\nof the imprint in figure 14-4 indicates that this\ncohesion is relatively stronger than the adhesion\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n242\n\nbetween the soil and the sole of the boot. Although\nsimilar soil characteristics were observed in Apollo\n11 and 12 mission photographs, the cohesion of\nthe lunar soil shown in the Apollo 14 photography\nappears to be less than at the other sites. One\npossible explanation for the difference in the soil\ncohesion is a coarser grain-size distribution for\nthe soil at the Apollo 14 site. The bulk of the soil\nparticles is smaller than the ALSCC is capable of\nresolving (0.085 mm) ; however, more resolvable\nparticles apparently occur in the Apollo 14 bootprint photographs. The nature and cause of the\nlunar soil cohesion are not fully understood, and\nmore study is required.\n\nUndisturbed SoiI\nDuring the Apollo 11, 12, and 14 missions, the\nastronauts reported that in some places the ground\nappeared much like a beach after a heavy rain.\nThe observation was interpreted as a characteristic regularity of indentation size and distribution.\nHowever, the \xe2\x80\x9craindrop\xe2\x80\x9d phenomenon is not evident in the stereopairs obtained by the Apollo 14\ncrew (figs. 14-7 to 14-10). Even though the\ndefinition in the stereopairs is better than that of\na crewman standing on the lunar surface, the\nlimited surface area seen may not allow the effect\nto be observed.\nThe origin of the raindrop pattern is not known,\n\nFIGURE\n14-7.-Undisturbed\n\nsoil (A314-77-10368).\n\nFIGURE\n14-8.-Undisturbed\n\nsoil (AS14-77-10370).\n\nbut the pattern is thought to be the result of small\ncraters formed by the impact of meteoritic particles or of craters formed by secondary impacts\nof fragments from larger events. Attempts to simulate meteoroid impacts, using sand as the receiving medium, have resulted in bowl-shaped craters.\nHowever, one of the best-defined craters in figure\n14-7 is steep walled rather than bowl shaped. The\ndifference in the shape of the craters may be due\nto the difference between the mechanical properties of the lunar soil and those of sand, or the\ncrater in the figure may be the result of a lowspeed secondary impact.\nAnother characteristic feature of the lunar soil\nnoted by the Apollo 14 crew was the abundance\nof lineations. A slight, though clearly visible, pattern of lines rising slightly from left to right is\nshown in figure 14-7; in figure 14-8, the lineation.; appear similar to scratch marks and run from\nthe top left center to the center of the photograph.\nIn figure 14-9, the lineations appear nearly\nparallel and run upward approximately 20\xe2\x80\x9d from\nright to left i the photograph. When viewed\nn\nstereoscopically, some of the lineations appear as\nridges at one point and as depressions at another.\nThese linear features strongly resemble the lineations produced (on approximately the same scale)\nin insulating powders subjected to electron bombardment.\nAt the top of figure 14-7, the imprint of the\n\nLUNAR-SURFACE CLOSEUP STEREOSCOPIC PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nFIGURE\n14-9.-Soil-covered\n10371).\n\nrock\n\nsurface (AS14-77-\n\nedge of the camera indicates that the surface material is a fine powder that can be molded precisely. All the particles visible in figures 14-7 and\n14-8 are aggregates of fragmental material ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.6 mm. The only individual\nfragments resolvable in figure 14-8 are white,\nequant to elongate, angular fragments that may be\ncrystalline rocks, fragmental rocks, or feldspathic\ncrystals.\n\nFIGURE\n14-1O.Soil-covered rock surface (AS14-7710372).\n\n14-1 1 .-Soil-covered\nFIGURE\n10373).\n\n243\n\nrock surface (AS14-77-\n\nAs in figures 14-7 and 14-8, the soil in figures\n14-9, 14-10, and 14-11 appears to be cohesive\nwith equant aggregates bound into the surface.\nThe aggregates in figure 14-9 range in size from\n0.1 to 6 mm.\nRock Surfaces\nThe rock surface partially visible in figure 14-9\nis obscured by soil at the rock base or by soil\nlapped up onto the rock. The rock is located at\nstation A (frame AS14-9409 or fig. 3-3, sec. 3)\nand is white and crystalline or clastic. The rock\nappears to have a relatively smooth surface with\na small glass-lined impact pit visible at point A\nin the figure. Indications of other pits in the rock\nsurface exist, but they are dust covered. The dust\ncover on the rock ranges up to 3 mm deep, with\naggregates as large as 2 mm in diameter adhering\nto the surface.\nThe rock surface in figure 14-10 is partially\nvisible in the upper half of the photograph. The\npits in this rock may also be due to micrometeoroid impacts. (An example of the pits is given\nat A in fig. 14-10.) The rock is clastic with clasts\nvisible at points B and C in the figure. The clast\nat point B appears clastic with elongate white\nclasts in a gray matrix.\nThe last frame of the stereoscopic photography\n\n244\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n(fig. 14-11) was obtained during the winding up\nof the fYm before unloading. The depression in\nthe photograph is several inches deep and may\nhave been made by a crewmember. The light area\nin the left side of the photograph is the result of\nsunlight leaking into the area under the hood of\nthe ALSCC.\nAll the fragments visible in figure 14-1 1 are\n0.2-mm to 2-cm clastic rocks or aggregates.\nEquant fragments with spinose or very irregular\nsurfaces are aggregates of soil particles (examples\nat point A in fig. 14-11) and angular fragments\nexhibiting smooth fracture surfaces (examples at\npoints B and C in fig. 14-11) may be clastic rock\nfragments. The spiny fragment at D may be soil\nbonded by glass spatter. The needlelike spines\naround the periphery of this fragment may be\nprojections of glass.\n\nTABLE\n14-II.

The coatings may be\nused in subsequent lunar missions on such items\nas the lunar communications relay unit, the lunar\nroving vehicle, the television camera, and the\nApollo lunar-surface experiments package.\nTwo duplicate arrays (serial nos. 1001 and\n1002), each containing samples of the 12 thermal\ncoatings (table 14-11), were taken to the Moon.\nA series of seven stereopairs of the arrays was\nobtained for three conditions (table 14411) :\nwhen the arrays were pristine (i.e., before exposure to lunar soil), when the arrays were dusted,\nand after the lunar dust had been brushed off.

Before the photograph in figure\n14-13 was taken, the whole unit was apparently\njarred. The resultant impact removed the filling\nfrom the indented numbers without, however,\ncompletely destroying the shapes. Recognizable\nnumbers formed by the dust were displaced several millimeters from the positions in which they\nmust have originally been formed. This phenomenon indicates that the electric fields around\nthe edges of the indented numbers must have been\neffective in attracting the dust grains toward them\nand that the dust must have been sufficiently\ncohesive to be shaken out later without the formed\nnumbers breaking apart.\nPanel 4 in figure 14-12 appears to have an edge\nof fine powder surrounding each clump.

Several clumps of dust\non panel 2 are remarkably high and appear to\nstand up straight from the surface. The clumps of\nsoil on panel 10 (fig. 14-13) appear to have been\nsurrounded by dust causing a halo effect. The dust\non panel 9 was preferentially attracted to the edge\nof the panel and may have been displaced from\nthe original position. The number denoting panel\n8 and the letter S are neatly sled with dust that\nhas not been displaced. All these effects noted in\nfigures 14-12 and 14-13 indicate that the manner\nof settling of the dust is markedly influenced by\nelectrostatic effects, that edges and grooves have\nsignificant effects on locaI electric fields, and that\nthe different panel surfaces have different electrical properties.\nArray 7002\n\nFIGURE\n14-13.-Panels\n9 to 12 of T D S 1001 covered\nw t soil (AS14-77-10367).\nih\n\nThe other TDS array (serial no. 1002), panels\n1 to 12, is shown covered with soil in figures\n14-14 and 14-15. It is evident that the different\npanels had a different effect on the manner in\nwhich the dust settled. Panel 6 has a rather uniform contamination of a thin soil layer, whereas\non panels 3 and 5 the dust settled in a more uneven manner. The screw above panel 3 appears\nto have attracted more dust than the neighboring\nsurface, whereas panels 2 and 4 are remarkably\nclean compared with the intervening metal surface.\nIn particular, the gap around panel 4 appears t\no\nbe well filled with dust in some places, while the\npanel itself is absolutely clean. Some difference\nexists in the manner of deposition on panel 10\ncompared with the other panels in figure 14-15.\nThe lower edge of the entire unit appears to have\npreferentially attracted dust that appears to be\n\n246\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n1 to 6 of TDS 1002 covered with\nFIGURE\n14-14.-Panels\nsoil (AS14-77-1 03 62).\n\nthe dust had an electric charge. Whether the\ncharge on the dust was acquired as a result of the\nphotoelectric effect in the sunlight, or whether it\nwas the consequence of having been handled by\nthe astronauts, who, in turn, through friction during walking, would have acquired a substantial\ncharge, is not known. A further investigation and\na laboratory simulation of the process with the\nsame surface samples would be desirable.\nAfter array 1002 was sprinkled with soil and\nphotographed, the array was brushed off with a\nnylon-bristle brush and photographed again (figs.\n14-16 and 14-17). Most of the soil was removed\nas a result of the brushing action. A small amount\nof soil remained on panels 10 and 12 and on some\nof the screws. The striations on some panels (figs.\n14-16 and 14-17) were evidently caused by the\nbrush. After the photography of the array was\ncompleted, the array was packaged and returned\nto Earth. Further study of the overall effect of the\nlunar soil on the thermal samples is underway.\nSummary\n\nThe Apollo 14 mission photography is the first\nlook at definitely undisturbed lunar regolith surfaces.

The indented\nnumbers across the middle of figure 14-15 have\nattracted dust preferentially, as evidenced by the\noutline formed by the soil in some parts of the\nnumbers.\nThe disposition of the dust on the blocks appears to be dependent on electrostatic effects connected with the nature of the surfaces and the\ndetails of the shape. This relationship implies that\n\nFIGURE\n14-16.-Panels\n1 to 6 of TDS 1002 after the soil\nwas brushed off (AS14-77-10364).\n\nLUNAR-SURFACE CLOSEUP STEREOSCOPIC PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nFIGURE\n14-17.-Panels\n7 to 12 of TDS 1002 after the\nsoil was brushed off (AS14-77-10365).\n\nhaust. The crew described the surface at the\nApollo 14 site as powdery (visible in 70-mm\nphotography). The surface is covered with loose\nand partly buried, equant aggregates of soil and\nfragments of fragmental rocks of less than 0.1 mm\nto several millimeters in diameter. The equant\naggregates give the powdery appearance to the\nsurface. Within the resolution of the photography,\nno individual grains were visible. The coherence\nof these aggregates is easily destroyed, as can be\nseen in the photographs of MET tracks (figs.\n14-2 and 14-3) and boot tracks (figs. 14-4 and\n14-5).\nAlthough the behavior of the lunar soil at the\nApollo 14 site is qualitatively similar to that of\nthe soils at the Apollo 11 and 12 sites, the co-\n\n247\n\nhesion appears to be slightly less. Yet, the cohesion\nis still relatively stronger than the adhesion to any\nobject placed against it and produces clean, distinct impressions.\nThe raindrop patterns noticed by the astronauts\nappear to be pits formed by the impact of micrometeoroids in the lunar soil. The stereopairs provide excellent documentation of the pits and\nshould be studied further by investigators interested in crater morphology.\nPhotographs of the contact between the soil\nsurface and rocks buried in the soil show the kind\nof fillet that can form in such cases. Linear patterns are evident in the powdery soil on a scale of\nmillimeters in width and many centimeters in\nlength. The origin of this phenomenon requires\nfurther investigation.\n\nReferences\n14-1. ANON.: Lunar Surface Closeup Stereoscopic\nPhotography. Sec. 9 of Apollo 11 Preliminary\nScience Report.

Roosa\nR\n\nThe Apollo 14 investigation was the first phase\nof this experiment and was considered to be an\noperational test to determine the feasibility of\nperforming dim-light photography from the Apollo\ncommand module (CM) using an available\ncamera equipped with a fast lens. The experiment\nwill be continued on later missions. The 16-mm\ndata acquisition camera equipped with an f/0.95\nor T/1 lens was used. Even though the format of\nthis camera is small for gegenschein photography,\nit provided an acceptable operational test and\nproduced a preliminary set of exposures. Fifteen\nexposures were obtained, six more than required.\nVehicle pointing and stability were well within\nthe desired limits of -1-1" and were much better\nthan had been expected. Star fields were easily\nidentified. The original negatives are being\nanalyzed in detail with a microdensitometer.\nAnalysis of the vehicle pointing and stability and\nthe exposure level has provided the basis for the\ntimeline and exposure sequences for the Apollo\n15 mission experiment phase. Basic exposures of\n3 and 1 min have been set as a result of the\noperational test during the Apollo 14 mission.\n\nmistaken for a high cirrus cloud; however, a simple\ntest can be used if one remembers that this faint\npatch is always located exactly opposite the Sun\n(i.e., the antisolar point). Under very favorable\nconditions, the gegenschein appears to be approximately 10" in diameter but, when the surrounding\nsky is brighter, it appears smaller or may even be\nundetectable. The only known aspect of the gegenschein phenomenon is that it is sunlight reflected\nto the observer by grains of dust-in space:+Th-e\'\nlocation of the dust has been a continuing mystery.\nNear the turn of the century, Carl Moulton and\nH. Gylden theorized that the dust might accumulate, or at least linger, at the libration point L,\nof the Sun-Earth system (fig. 15-1). This theory\nwas widely accepted for the first half of this century. More recently, however, doubts have arisen,\n\nThe Light Called the Gegenschein\n\nThe gegenschein (counterglow), which has been\nknown for more than a century, is an extended\nlight source, a very faint patch of light, visible\nnear the antisolar point in the night sky under\nfavorable conditions. This phenomenon can be\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center.\nDudley Observatory.\nNASA Manned Spacecraft Center.\nt Principal investigator.\n\nFIGURE\n15-l.-The\n\nlocation of the libration points for\nthe Sun-Earth system.\n\n249\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n250\n\nand this Apollo experiment is expected to settle\nthe issue of whether any significant portion of the\ngegenschein is caused by a collection of particles\nat this libration point.\nLibration Points\n\nThe libration points were discovered long ago\nby the French mathematician Lagrange. They are\npoints of equilibrium in a three-body gravitating\nsystem, where gravitational forces caused by the\nprimary and secondary bodies are balanced by\ncentrifugal forces resulting from rotation of the\nsystem (ref. 15-1 ) . Five such points exist (shown\nin fig. 15-1 for the Sun-Earth system). They are\nfixed in a coordinate system rotating about the\nSun synchronously with the Earth. The orbit of\nthe Earth is, of course, determined by a balance\nbetween centrifugal force and solar gravity. Farther out on the Sun-Earth lime, there is an excess\nof centrifugal force over solar gravity, but there\nis a point (approximately 1.5 million km from\nEarth) at which this excess force is just compensated by the additional gravitational attraction\nof the Earth. This is the libration point L,. Similar\nconsiderations determine the other points.\nIn theory, the points L, and L,, which form\nequilateral triangles with the Sun and Earth, are\nstable equilibrium points and the others are unstable. In practice, the situation is complicated\nby perturbations caused by other planets and the\nMoon, and the detailed stability of the points\nremains controversial. It is known, however, that,\nin the case of the Sun-Jupiter system, the equilateral libration points contain accumulations of\nlarge rocks known as the Trojan asteroids. Furthermore, Earth-based observations of faint clouds\nat the equilateral points of the Earth-Moon system\nhave been reported; these regions were also photo-\n\nn\n\ngraphed during the Apollo 14 mission, but the\nimages have not yet been analyzed (see. 18). It\nshould be noted that it is possible for clouds of\nparticles to persist even at unstable libration points\nif the loss of particles is sufficiently slow to be\ncompensated by the influx and capture (through\ncollision processes) of interplanetary dust.\nAn Alternate Explanation of the Gegenschein\n\nAn alternate hypothesis to Moulton\xe2\x80\x99s explanation is that the gegenschein is a phase effect (preferential backscatter) from sunlight incident on\ninterplanetary-dust that is farther out ,in the solar\nsystem. It is known that the zodiacal light, a\nluminous band lying in the ecliptic plane near\nthe Sun (and hence only visible just before dawn\nand after sunset), is due to scattering of sunlight\nfrom micrometeoroids. Some scientists believe\nthe gegenschein is merely an intensification of the\nzodiacal light in the antisolar direction because of\nthe scattering properties of small particles. If this\nbe the case, the light perhaps originates in the\nasteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.\nTriangulation\n\nBecause the orbit of the Moon offsets it from\nthe Sun-Earth line by as much as 384 000 km,\nobservations of the gegenschein from lunar orbit\nmay allow triangulation to be used to determine\nwhich of these hypotheses is correct. If the light\noriginates at the Moulton point L1, it should be\ndisplaced approximately 15 O from the antisolar\ndirection, as seen from the Moon when it is near\nquarter phase. If no significant shift in position be\nobserved, the light must come from much farther\naway (fig. 15-2) and can have no signilkant\nconnection with the Earth.\nMoulton region\n\n.- .\n.\n\nLight from Sun\n\nFIGURE\n15-2.-The\n\nMoulton region.\n\nLight from gegenschein\n\nGEGENSCHEIN-MOULTON REGION PHOTOGRAPHY FROM LUNAR ORBIT\n\nBackground Experiment Information\nThis experiment is a conclusive observational\ntest of the contribution of dust at the Moulton\npoint to the phenomenon of the gegenschein. In\naddition to the advantage of the geometry afforded\nby observations of the antisolar and Moulton\nregion from lunar orbit, the optical environment\nis improved. The gegenschein has a very low\nbrightness; therefore, it is important that the experiment photography be performed from as dark\na region as possible. The Apollo 14 spacecraft in\nlow lunar orbit spent approximately 25 min every\n2 hr in the darkest region of the universe that man\nhas reached, where both sunlight and earthshine\nare blocked by the Moon (a region referred to\nas the \xe2\x80\x9cdouble umbra\xe2\x80\x9d). Making observations\nfrom lunar orbit, of course, also removes the problems associated with the airglow of the Earth.\nThe earliest experiment on zodiacal light and\ngegenschein from a manned spacecraft occurred\non the Project Mercury MA-9 flight (ref. 15-2),\non which a specially modified, high-speed camera\nsystem was used. Similar investigations were conducted during several of the Gemini program missions (refs. 15-3 and 15-4) using standard flight\ncamera systems containing higher speed films for\ntheir better light-collecting characteristics. A\nGemini program experiment entitled \xe2\x80\x9cDim-Light\nPhotography\xe2\x80\x9d (refs. 15-4 to 15-7) provided partial success in similar investigative attempts. Related studies have been performed from rockets,\nballoons, and unmanned orbiting vehicles under\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center sponsorship.\nOn previous manned space flights, degradation\nof data collected from low-intensity astronomical\nsources could be attributed to several factors. The\nmore obvious of these are spacecraft-window\ncleanliness and transmission qualities, as well as\nlight-scattering effluents from spacecraft purges,\ndumps, ventings, and depressurizations, particularly if there is any nearby natural light source\nsuch as airglow to illuminate these contaminants.\nA more subtle problem is the difficulty of avoiding\nextremely-low-level stray light from the spacecraft\ncabin and from spacecraft-thrustor firings during\nattitude changes and stabilization. The flightcrew\nmust literally work in the dark during periods of\ndata collection to avoid the problems that might\nobscure the phenomenon under study. In some\n\n25 1\n\ncases, the contaminatinglight levels are well below\nthe visual threshold of the crew, and their presence\nis undetected. The phenomena being photographed\nare equally as faint, and the crew must use computed attitudes or secondary aiming points. Furthermore, a darkened cabin makes the use of\nclocks, attitude indicators, and written checklists\ndifficult. This situation complicatesthe data-collection procedures and hampers the acquisition of\nnecessary supportive data to the accuracy desired.\nThe Apollo 14 operational techniques were devised to eliminate the use of cabin lights near the\ncamera and the use of thrustors while the camera\nshutter was open for the most critical data-collection tasks. In addition, a special window shield,\ndesigned primarily for this experiment, was installed to isolate the window and camera optics\nfrom the faint internal cabin lighting required\nto set up and time the exposures.\n\nOperational Conduct of the Experiment\nThree sets of photographs were required to\nmeet the experiment objectives. Each set was to\nconsist of two 20-sec exposures and one 5-sec\nexposure taken in quick succession. The first set\nwas pointed near the antisolar direction; the second set, midway between the antisolar position and\nthe computed position of the Moulton point as\nviewed from the Moon; and the last set, near the\nposition of the Moulton point.\nThe 16-mm data acquisition camera was used\nwith an 18-mm focal-length lens set at f/0.95\nand Kodak 2485, black-and-white, high-speed\nrecording film. (This type film had been used successfully to record faint dayglow from a rocket\n(ref. 15-43).) The camera was bracket mounted\nin the right-hand rendezvous window with a rightangle mirror assembly attached in front of d e\nlens. A remote-control electrical cable was attached to the camera to allow actuation of the\nshutter from the lower equipment bay. The flight\nfilm had special low-light-level calibration exposures added to it both preflight and postflight.\nSeveral days before the time of the Apollo 14\ndata collection, ground-based photography of the\ngegenschein was obtained using identical equipment and film. The schedule required that the experiment be performed at 12:26 G.m.t., February\n5 , 1971, during the 15th orbit of the Moon. Com-\n\n252\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nmunications between the Mission Control Center\nand the CM during experiment performance were\nnot possible because of the spacecr&-Moon-Earth\ngeometry.\n\nResults\nPreliminary inspection of the flight film has\nshown that the proper star field was photographed\nand that the spacecraft maintained a very steady\ninertial zttitude during the time exposures. The\nanalytic procedure consists of studying two sets\nof images: the flight film and the ground-based\npictures taken from the McDonald Observatory\nnearly simultaneously with the Apollo 14 photography. Each set is measured on a microdensitometer that digitizes and transfers the entire\npicture to magnetic tape. Then, a computer program processes the tape and automatically removes all the bright stars in the picture. Another\nportion of the program corrects the picture for\nthe known vignetting effect of the lens. Finally,\na Cal-Comp plotter is used to plot equal brightness\ncontours of the true sky brightness in the picture.\nOn these plots, the gegenschein should appear as\na small isolated hill on an otherwise-flat plane.\nUnless the gegenschein appears in the same place\nrelative to the stars on both ground-based and\nApollo 14 photography (after correcting for any\ndifferences in the times at which the exposures\nwere made), parallax will have been detected.\nConsequently, the distance to the particle cloud\ncan be computed.\nAll the computer programs have been written\nand tested; however, some minor improvements\nstill remain to be added to the plotting program.\nApproximately half of the ground-based photographs have been processed with the microdensitometer; several have had stars successfully removed, and two have already been plotted.\nBecause no significant difficulties have been experienced in the processing, measurements of the\nflight film can be started. However, the flight-film\nimages will be mounted semipermanently between\nglass plates before further handling. It is already\nevident from the Apollo 14 experiment that the\npointing accuracy of the spacecraft is sufficient to\n\npermit longer exposures (probably in the range\nof 1 to 3 min each) on the next flight. Also, a\nbetter measure of the exposure time and f-stop\nappropriate to the characteristics of the Kodak\n2485 film has been gained. No information exists\nyet regarding the location of the gegenschein-the\nprime objective of the experiment-because this\ndetermination requires careful microdensitometric\nmeasurement.\nReferences\n15-1.

S-Band Transponder Experiment\nW.L.Sjogren,\'? P. Gottlieb,"P. M . Muller," and W.R. Wollenhaupt\n\nThe S-band transponder experiment, performed\nfrom the orbiting command and service module\nand lunar module (LM) , provides detailed information on the near-side lunar gravity field. The\ndata when completely reduced will encompass a\n100-km-wide band along the Apollo 14 lunarsurface track shown in figure 16-1. The experiment uses the same technique of gravity determination employed on the Lunar Orbiter mission data\nfrom which the large anomalies called mascons\n(refs. 16-1 to 16-3) were first observed. No\nspecial instruments are required other than the\nexisting real-time radio navigation system. The\ndata consist of variations in the spacecraft speed\nas measured by the navigation system.\nTechniques\n\ncounter is read every second, whereas at low\nresolution, it is read once a minute. Not only is\nthe cycle-count difference recorded but the fractional part of the cycle is measured. This process\nallows a resolution in the measurements of approximately 0.01 Hz or 0.65 mm/sec. This speed\n(range rate) observable is often referred to as\ndoppler or line-of-sight velocity.\nThe raw data represent or contain many components of motion, and these must be removed\nbefore gravity analysis can proceed. Factors that\nmust be zccounted for include the tracking-station\nrotation about the Earth spin axis; the spacecraft\nmotion perturbed by accelerations from the Sun,\nEarth, Moon, and planets; and atmospherics and\nsignal-transit times. All these quantities are known\na priori and are removed to accuracies well be-\n\nThe schematic drawing in figure 16-2 shows\nthe basic measuring system. A very stable frequency of 2115 MHz obtained from a cesium\nreference is transmitted to the orbiting spacecraft.\nThe transponder in the spacecraft multiplies the\nreceived frequency by the constant 240/221 (so as\nto avoid self-lockup) and transmits to the Earth.\n(The transmitted and received frequencies are\nwithin the S-band region.) At the Earth receiver,\nthe initial transmitted frequency, multiplied by the\nsame constant, is subtracted and the resulting\ncycle-count differences are accumulated in a\ncounter along with the precise time at which\ndifferencing occurred. These cycle-count differences are the doppler shift in frequency fd caused\nby the radial component V , of the spacecraft\nvelocity or (2V,/c) 2300 MHz, where c is the\nspeed of light.

It should be noted that figure\n16-4 contains just that portion of figure 16-3\nbetween 23 and 29 min past epoch and indeed\nverities that the small variations in figure 16-3\nare valid and not just noisy points.\nOnce these residuals are checked for consistency between adjacent orbits and all blunder\npoints are removed, analytic patched cubic splines\nwith second derivative continuous are leastsquares-fitted to the residuals. These functions are\nthen differentiated and the line-of-sight accelerations ("gravity") are analyzed and correlated with\nthe subspacecraft lunar track and existing topography. At present, five of the 10 good orbits have\nbeen screened; when all are completed, the accelerations as a function of spacecraft lunar latitude\nand longitude will be plotted on a 1 :1 000 000\nMercator projection through -1-70" of longitude.\nBecause these are line-of-sight, rather than vertical, gravity components, a geometric effect exists\nthat shifts gravity-feature locations toward the\nlimbs and reduces the amplitude slightly. The\nshift is a little more than 1" and the amplitude\nreduction is about 30 percent for an object at\n50" longitude. Altitudes over the 100-km band\nvary from 17 km at periapsis (-5 O longitude) to\n37 km at 50" longitude.

The consistency of the adjacent orbits is clearly evident,\nand the increase in amplitude is precisely what\nshould occur as the center of the Nectaris mascon\nrotates closer to the orbit plane.\nThe second approach is to estimate a dense\nsurface grid of disk masses spaced approximately\n1 " to 2" apart and lying along the orbit surface\ntrack. This estimation will involve determining\n200 to 300 masses along with the state parameters\nfrom some 20 independent orbits-10\nat low\naltitude (17 km (9.2 n. mi.), periapsis) and 10\nat high altitude (110 km (59.4 n. mi), periapsis).\nThese results will be more quantitative than those\nderived from the first approach because all the\ngeometric and dynamic effects will be accounted\nfor and no spurious effects will result from the\nleast-squares operations (which reduce the absolute amplitude of the residuals and sometimes\nintroduce erroneous negative accelerations (ref.\n16-4) ) . This reduction is in process at the time\nof writing this report.\nThe analysis of the impact orbit of the LM\nshould be very interesting because very-lowaltitude data were obtained. Resolution will increase and small features may be visible.\n\nPreliminary Results\nPreliminary implications from the scant data\nreduced to date may be deduced from figure\n16-5, which shows gravity profiles over the Nectaris mascon. The flat-top characteristic of these\ncurves is highly indicative of a flat surface feature,\nas was noted by Kane (ref. 16-5). Using models\nof a deeply buried point mass and a surface plate,\nhe simulated both high-altitude (100 km) and\nlow-altitude (30 km) gravity profiles. The two\nmodels appeared much the same at high altitude,\nbut at 30 km the plate had the flat-top appearance.\nThus, the first implication is that the mascons are\nlikely to be near-surface features rather than\ndeeply buried inhomogeneities.\nAnother fact from figure 16-5 is that the longitude of the maximum amplitude does not occur at\nthe physical center (longitude 34" E) of Nectaris\nas one would expect. A geometric correction of\n0.5" exists because of the viewing angle. The\ngravity center appears to be another degree west.\n\n256\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nThis condition may be due to the Theophilus\nblanket thrown out over the old Nectaris mare.\nThe additional shouldering at longitude 29.5" E\nmay also be caused by the Theophilus blanket. If\ntrue, this observation would imply that no signscant isostatic adjustment had occurred after the\nTheophilus event. Although not shown in figure\n16-5, Theophilus has a perfectly centered negative-gravity anomaly implying that the Theophilus\nevent caused a loss of mass and no subsequent\nisostatic adjustment has taken place. Many similar\nconclusions will no doubt be reached when the\ncomplete band of gravity data is k a l l y mapped.\n\nReferences\n16-1.\n\nMULLER, M.; AND SJOGREN, L.: Mascons:\nP.\nW.\nLunar Mass Concentrations.

Transmissions from the orbiting command and service\nmodule (CSM) are directed toward the lunar\nsurface, and oblique reflections of these signals\nare monitored on the Earth.\nThe received signals are processed in a way\nthat preserves the information (frequency, phase,\npolarization, and amplitude) contained in them\nas functions of time. Comparison of the received\nechoes with the known characteristics of the transmitted signal (through the application of a welldeveloped scattering theory (ref. 17-1 ) ) yields\nquantitative information about lunar crustal properties, such as dielectric constant, average slope and\nslope probability, and small-scale surface roughness. These characteristics are of interest to several\ndisciplines concerned with the problems of lunar\nhistory, evolution, and origin. The experiment\nresults will probably prove most useful in defining the processes that tend to modify the lunar\nsurface and in distinguishing between adjacent\n(and perhaps subjacent) geological units. The\nexperimental observations are also of intrinsic\ninterest to those involved in the study of electromagnetic scattering.\nBoth the radar technique and the associated\ntheory have evolved rapidly in recent years. The\nApollo 14 bistatic-radar experiment is a strong\ntest of the convergence between theory and technique because numerous comparisons exist (ref.\n17-2) that can be made with photographic, geological, magnetic, seismic, and sampling experiments conducted within the radar field of view.\na Stanford University.\nf Principal investigator.\n\nand G. L. Tyler\n\nAn ultimate goal of this work is the remote determination of the vertical crustal structure.\nIt will soon be possible to extend this technique\nto investigations of the Earth and other planetsthe Earth, for resource investigations; Mars, for\nsimilar goals as were attempted for the Moon; and\nVenus, shrouded in dense clouds, for the only\ninformation man may ever gain on the construction\nof the surface.\nFor the experiment discussed in this report, it\nwas possible to use continuous-wave transmissions\nfrom both the S-band telemetry system (the spacecraft-to-Earth communications link) and the\nvery-high-frequency (vhf ) communication system\n(normally used for voice transmissions and ranging between the CSM and the lunar module in\nlunar orbit). The techniques employed are similar\nto those that had been used previously in conjunction with the Lunar Orbiters 1 and 3 and\nExplorer 35 spacecraft (refs. 17-3 and 1 7 4 ) .\nSimultaneous S-band (0.13-m) and vhf ( 1.2-m)\nobservations were conducted on approximately\ntwo-thirds of one near-side pass while the CSM\nwas maneuvered to maintain a predetermined\norientation of the spacecraft antennas with respect\nto the lunar surface. There were four complete\npasses of vhf data alone. The vhf data were obtained in an inertial attitude hold, which resulted\nin a constant variation of the illumination with\nrespect to the scattering geometry. Echoes of Sband transmissions were received with the NASA\n210-ft antenna located at Goldstone, Calif.; and\nvhf echoes were received with the 150-ft antenna\nof the Stanford Research Institute.\nGood data were obtained during all the observation periods. These data represent about an\norder-of-magnitude improvement in the signal-tonoise ratio and surface resolution over the results\nof previous experiments of this type. In addition,\n\n257\n\n258\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nthere has also been a significant increase in knowledge of the experiment parameters and controls.\nThe simultaneous S-band and vhf observations\nform a unique data set.\nAt the present time, the major portion of the\ndata-reduction process has been completed. Data\nanalysis is awaiting certain ancillary Manned\nSpacecraft Center (MSC) ephemeris computations required to define the experiment geometry.\nThe theoretical basis for the experiment, the experiment design, and the experiment data are\ndescribed in subsequent portions of this report.\nPreliminary results are given in the form of echo\npower spectra and echo polarization spectra.\n\nI\n\nBasic Theory\n\nThe bistatic-radar echo is composed of the sum\nof the reflections from the area of the Moon that\nis mutually visible from the spacecraft and the\nEarth. Because continuous-wave transmissions are\nused, echoes from this entire area are received\nsimultaneously. For the purposes of analysis, the\necho signal may be considered to be arising from\na large number of elemental surfaces, each with\nan area ds. Then, from the radar equation, the\npower received from a particular area ds is\n\nwhere\n\ndPR== power received from the elemental\narea ds\nPT=transmitted power\nGT =gain of the transmitting antenna\nrl = distance from the transmitter to ds\nu0 =incremental radar cross section at ds\nds =elemental area on the lunar surface\nrz =distance from ds to the receiving antenna\nA =effective aperture of the receiving antenna\nThe geometry of the problem is illustrated in figure 17-1. The total received power is obtained by\nintegration over the surface S (the surface that is\nmutually visible from the spacecraft and the\nEarth), or\n\nTo the Earth\n\nFIGURE\n17-1 .-Experiment\nnition.\n\ngeometry and parameter defi-\n\nwhere it is assumed that the variations in rz over\nthe area S are negligible and that GT is constant\nover the area S.Both G and u0 are retained within\nT\nthe integral to emphasize the fact that they may\nvary considerably with the scattering geometry or,\nf T\nin the case of u0, with the location of ds. I G is\nconstant over S, then the cross section may be\nseparated from the other parameters, or\n\np R --\n\nPTGTA\n-~ U\n( 4 ~\'Rir22\n)\n\n(17-3)\n\nwhere\nP\n\nand R, is the distance of the spacecraft from the\ncenter of the Moon.\nIn general, the principal contributions to u arise\nfrom a small region about the center of the first\nFresnel zone, which is the specular point on the\nmean lunar surface. In ray-optics terminology,\nthis is the point at which the angles of incidence\nand reflection are equal. If the Moon were a perfectly smooth sphere, al the echo would originate\nl\nfrom a Fresnel-zone-site spot surrounding this\n\n259\n\nBISTATIC-RADAR INVESTIGATION\n\npoint. By roughening the surface through the introduction of large-scale (with respect to a wavelength) topographic undulations, this spot is\ncaused to break up into a number of glints. The\nlocation of these glints will correspond to specular\nreflection from local surface undulations. Echoes\nthat result from this type of surface are designated\nquasi-specular.\nQuasi-specular scattering constitutes the principal scattering mechanism in this experiment. To\nthe first order, the effects of surface material composition and shape are separable; that is, if u is the\nradar cross section of a perfectly conducting surface of a particular shape, then the radar cross\nsection of a dielectric surface of precisely the\nsame shape and with reflectivity p is\nu=pu\n\nA\n\n(17-5)\n\nor, from the radar equation\n\n(17-6)\nThus, if u can be measured and 8 is known, then p\nmay be determined.\nThe quantity ^a may be computed on the basis\nof statistical surface models. The results of one\nsuch computation for a gently undulating surface\n\nwith a gaussian height distribution and autocorrelation function are given for bistatic geometry\nin figure 17-2. The radar cross section is plotted\nas a function of the angle formed by the spacecraft, the center of the Moon, and the Earth. The\ntwo families of curves (solid and dashed) are\nparametric in the normalized spacecraft orbital\nradius measured from the center of the Moon.\nThe dashed curves correspond to a perfectly\nsmooth sphere, and the solid curves correspond\nto a surface with root-mean-square (rms) slopes\nof 10". The effect of the surface slopes on the\ncross section is second order. The reflectivity of\nthe Moon is inferred from the data by measuring\nthe total echo powers received and by normalizing\nthe results by the use of the theoretical reflectivity\nvalues (plotted in fig. 17-2 from the data given\nin ref. 17-4) for a perfectly conducting sphere.\nThe inferred reflectivity is then compared with\nthe reflectivity of a dielectric surface under oblique\ngeometry. The effective dielectric constant of the\nsurface may be determined directly from the observation of the Brewster angle and indirectly by\na quantitative comparison of the reflectivity values.\nThe bandwidth of the echo depends directly on\nthe surface slope. For the surface model considered previously, the bandwidth is given by\n\nAf =4.9\n\n( ) cos\n\nys tan p,, (17-7)\n\nwhere\nAf =one-half the power bandwidth of the echo\nspectrum\nv8 =velocity of the specular point with respect\nto the lunar surface\nA =wavelength\nya= angle of incidence on the mean surface\nat the specular point\npo=rms surface slope\n\nProbe angle, Yp,deg\n\nFIGURE\n17-2.-Normalized\nbistatic-radar cross section\nU / T as a function of spacecraft-MoonEarth angle yp\nfor a perfectly reflecting sphere with a gently undulating surface.\n\nOn the basis of this model, surface slopes may be\ninferred directly from the orbital parameters and\nthe width of the echo spectrum.\nPhysically, the spectrum is broadened according to the probability-density function of the surface slopes and the doppler shift. In figure 17-1,\nreflection from a point ahead of the mean reflecting point will have a greater doppler shift (determined by the angle between TI and V ) than those\n\n260\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\npoints behind the mean reflecting point. At every\npoint (on the basis of the quasi-specular model),\nthe probability of obtaining a reflection depends\non the probability of finding a local surface undulation with the proper slope. Slopes, then, also\ndetermine the surface resolution of the experiment.\nReflections are obtained from an area with a\nradius of 5 to 10 km (which is approximately\nequal to the rms slope multiplied by the spacecraft altitude).\nInferences based on this model are valid on a\nset of scales related to the wavelength of the probing wave. Quantitative comparisons of slope distributions inferred from Explorer 35 data and\nfrom photogrammetry have been conducted with\ngood results for a limited number of locations on\nthe lunar surface (ref. 17-5). Under fairly broad\nassumptions, the quasi-specular scattering may\nbe considered to occur at a fictitious surface that\nis a low-pass-filtered version of the actual surface.\nAIthough the bounds on this filter cutoff have been\nonly approximated, it is known that they scale\nwith the length of the probing wave. Typically,\nslopes on the order of 10 wavelengths (or longer)\nare expected to be important in the scattering\nprocess. Thus, for quasi-specular scattering, bistatic S-band data are sensitive to surface structure\non the order of 1.3 m (and larger); and for vhf,\n12 m is the lower bound. A more complete discussion of these theoretical concepts and results\nis available in reference 17-6.\nSurface-reflectivity measurements are also sensitive to wavelength. Dry geological materials with\napproximately the density of the lunar regolith\nexhibit loss tangents that are independent of the\nradiofrequency, for frequencies greater than approximately 10 MHz (ref. 17-7). Penetration\ndepths between 10 and 20 wavelengths are typical. Thus, the reflection coefficient inferred from\nS-band data will be sensitive to vertical structure\nwithin the lunar crust to a depth of 1 to 2 m and,\nfrom vhf data, to a depth of approximately 10\nto 20 m. Such penetration effects have been observed with Explorer 35 data obtained at a wavelength of 2.2 m (ref. 17-8).\nDiffuse scattering arises from wavelength-size\n(and smaller) surface structures and from secondorder effects of the gently undulating surface. In\nthe lunar case, the diffuse component of the re-\n\nflected radiation is normally associated with the\npresence of large numbers of wavelength-size (or\nsmaller) rock or rock fragments. Very small rocks\nwill be in the Rayleigh regime and will not contribute individually to the echo. Some attempts\nto provide quantitative descriptions of diffuse\nscattering in terms of rock distributions from the\nMoon have been made (ref. 17-9). However, in\nterms of surface structure, the diffuse scattering\nis not understood nearly so well as the quasispecular scattering.\nExperimentally, quasi-specular and diffuse\nscattering can be distinguished by its polarization\nand coherence properties and by the scattering\nlaw (ref. 17-1 0). Quasi-specular Scattering, which\nby definition originates from those portions of\nthe surface that produce mirrorlike reflections, is\ndeterministically polarized and is the predominant\nscattering mechanism. Although the echo polarization will change with variations in the polarization\nof the illuminating wave and the geometry, the\npolarization is the same as would be produced\nby a smooth surface of the same material. Diffisely\nscattered waves are not expected to exhibit this\nbehavior. To the extent that the diffuse component\narises from randomly oriented structures on or\nwithin the surface, it will be unpolarized. A decomposition of the echo spectrum into the polarized and unpolarized components provides a\nmechanism for separating the scattering from\nlarge-scale (wavelength) surface and small-scale\nrandomly oriented features or roughness.\nEquipment Description\nReceivers\n\nSchematic block diagrams of the receiving and\ndata-processing systems are shown in figure 17-3.\nThe NASA Deep Space Network 210-ft parabolic\nantenna at Goldstone, Calif., was used to receive\nthe S-band signals. Both the open- and closed-loop\nreceivers, which were installed for the Mariner\nspacecraft to be orbited about Mars in 1971, were\nused for the bistatic-radar experiment. Normal\nApollo mission operations are conducted with the\nregular ground-station receivers. A signal-conditioning unit processes the Mariner receiver 10MHz intermediate-frequency output.

Because the cost of the digital data\nreduction is directly proportional to the signal\nbandwidth, it is desirable to keep this bandwidth\nas small as possible. However, the possibility\nexisted that the CSM-transmitted frequency would\nchange by several times the echo bandwidth during\nthe experiment.\nEighty-kHz Mters are used in conjunction with\nthe open-loop receivers. This bandwidth was\nselected to insure that the echo would be within\n\nthe passband at all times during observation with\nonly a single, predetermined frequency setting.\nThe closed-loop (tracking receiver) bandwidth is\n20 kHz. This bandwidth is sufficiently wide to\ninsure that the echo is within the passband as long\nas the receiver is locked on the direct signal from\nthe CSM. The disadvantage of using the closedloop system alone is that brief periods exist when\nthe direct signal fades below the threshold required\nfor receiver lock. Wideband data can be processed\nfor those periods when lock is lost. On the Apollo\n14 mission, only one period of several minutes\nwas experienced during which the direct signal\nwas below the closed-loop threshold.\nBoth left and right circular polarizations are\n\n262\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nreceived. All receivers are driven from a single\nfrequency source, which enables the relative phase\nbetween polarizations to be preserved. System\nnoise temperature in this configuration is near 30"\nK when the antenna is aimed at the sky alone\nand 192" K when the Moon fills the beam of the\nantenna.\nThe vhf receiving facility was the 150-ft parabolic antenna at the Stanford Center for Radar\nAstronomy. A complete, open-loop receiver was\nconstructed, which consists of solid-state preamplifiers for 259.7 MHz with frequency conversions\nto 50 MHz, 10 MHz, and audio. The data bandwidth is determined at 10 MHz by 3.5-kHz-wide\nmultipole crystal filters. This bandwidth is narrower than the bandwidth with S-band, by the\nratio of the transmitted frequencies. Only openloop channels were used. As was the case for the\nS-band receiving system, left and right circularly\npolarized signals were received, and the system is\ncoherent. The system noise temperature is approximately 700" K.\nOpen-loop operation is similar at S-band and\nvhf. Based on a doppler ephemeris calculated\nfrom elements supplied by MSC personnel, the\nreceivers are tuned so that the direct signal will\nbe centered in the passband at the time the CSM\ncrosses the Earth-Moon line. The closed-loop\nreceiver is initially tuned according to the operational-frequency predictions for the CSM. Once\nlock is achieved, the receiver automatically compensates for doppler effects.\nTwo magnetic-tape recorders are used simultaneously for data recording. Tapes are started at\ndifferent times so that overlapping records with\nno gaps for tape changes are available.\n\nare low-pass filtered to avoid aliasing of the highfrequency tape-recorder noise in the sampling\nprocess. Sampling is synchronized with the original\nrecording time through the use of a NASA 36-bit\ntime code and a synchronizing waveform, both\nof which are multiplexed onto the data tracks of\nthe tape recorder. The two receiver channels, for\nright and left circular polarization, are sampled\nsimultaneously so that the coherence between\nchannels is preserved. Calibration signaIs are\nrecorded, sampled, and processed in the same\nmanner as the data.\nWeighted Fourier coefficients are computed using fast Fourier transform techniques. Groups\nof 1024 data samples (from each channel) are\nmultiplicatively weighted with a sine-squared data\nwindow, and the Fourier coefficients are computed. Because the three analog-data sources are\neach sampled at different rates, the corresponding\nfrequency and time resolutions of the spectral\nestimates are not uniform. When the effects of the\ndata window are considered, spectral resolution of\napproximately 40 Hz is achieved with the closedloop S-band data. A spectral resolution of approximately 10 Hz is obtained with the vhf data.\nThe Fourier coefficients are easily manipulated\nto provide a variety of data presentations. For\nexample, sums of the squares of successive Fourier\ncoefficient magnitudes yield spectral estimates of\nthe received signals. The time resolution and stability of these estimates may be varied simply by\nchanging the number of terms included in the\ntime average. Spectral estimates for signals in two\northogonal polarizations may be combined with\nthe cross spectra to obtain the polarization properties of the echo.\n\nData Reduction\n\nResults\nAt the time of this writing, the data obtained\nsimultaneously on S-band and vhf have been\nsampled, the Fourier coefficients computed, and\nthe preliminary spectra examined, The data have\nnot yet been correlated with position of the reflecting region on the lunar surface except in a\nmost general way. Some typical results are presented in figures 17-4 to 17-7.\nAn S-band power spectrum is shown in figure\n17-4. In this and the following figures, frequency\nincreases to the right and power increases linearly\n\nData reduction consists of a three-step process\nthat is independent of the data source, S-band\n(open or closed loop) or vhf. This process is\noutlined in the signal channel shown in figure\n17-3(b). First, the analog tapes are replayed and\ndigitally sampled. The sampled data are converted\nto weighted Fourier coefficients and spectral estimates. Finally, the weighted Fourier coefficients\nfrom the two polarization channels are combined\nto determine the polarization spectra of the echo.\nAs the analog data are played back, the signals\n\nBISTATIC-RADAR INVESTIGATION\n\nr\n\n263\n\nr\n\nI\n\n--- Direct signal\n\nEcho\n\nz\n\nL\nV\n\na\n\n1 -\n\nI\n\nI\n\n-6 kHz\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2287.5 MHZ\nFrequency of received signal\n\nI\n\n+6 kHz\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFIGURE\n17-4.4-band bistatic-radar spectrum taken over\na smooth mare region.\n\n1\n\nI\n\n-6 kHz\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2287.5 MHZ\nFrequency of received signal\n\nI\n\nI\n\n+6 kHz\n\nFIGURE\n17-5.-P-band\nbistatic-radar spectrum with a\nstrong discrete feature observable on the high-frequency side of the quasi-specular return.\n\nwith height.

Frequency increases to\nthe right, and the ordinate is linear in the polarized part of the echo power spectrum. The frequency resolution is approximately 40 Hz. The\nplot gives total polarized power in one of the final\ndata-reduction formats. Initially, the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d\nquasi-specular return dominates the center portion\nof the spectrum. A small reflection can be seen\nat the extreme right. As time progresses (2.5 sec\nbetween lines from the bottom to the top), this\nadditional feature increases in amplitude, splits\ninto two parts, and shifts downward in frequency.\nLater, a third, distinct reflection appears to the\nleft of the other two. The two outside reflections\nare from the crater walls, and their separation is\na measure of the crater size. As time progresses,\nthe crater echoes move through the principal reflection zone, at which point the crater clearly\ndominates the reflection process. As the reflecting\nregion moves past the crater, the normal signal\nfro= the homogeneous surface reappears.\n\nConclusions\nThe conclusions possible at this stage of data\nanalysis are mainly technical rather than scientific.\nAll facets of the experiment-from\nthe CSM\nmaneuvering through final plotting of polarization\nparameters-worked well.

For fairly homogeneous regions\nof the lunar surface, the data can be used to ob-\n\ntain surface parameters of direct interest to lunar\ngeology. The effects of the bulk surface electrical\nproperties (such as the Brewster angle) are clearly\nevident at both the vhf and S-band frequencies.\n\n265\n\nBISTATIC-RADAR INVESTIGATION\n\nIn these cases, the two sets of frequency data will\nprovide information that is either not obtainable\nin other ways or that can be obtained only through\nthe use of much more laborious methods. Analyih\nsis of these data in conjunction wt Apollo and\nLunar Orbiter photography should provide a more\ndetailed picture of the lunar surface than is possible from either type of observation alone.\nAl the signal characteristics described in the\nl\nportion of this report entitled \xe2\x80\x9cBasic Theory\xe2\x80\x9d\nhave been observed. For example, the general\ndifferences between mare and highland areas are\nclearly distinguishable at both frequencies as are\nnumerous smaller areas within both the maria\nand highlands. Further, there are many small,\nlocalized scattering features, many instances of\nan observable difEuse component, and large variations in the total received power throughout the\ndata.\nData analysis of the signals is just beginning.\nThe next step is to combine the data with detailed\ntrajectory and echo-locus computations. Normalization according to the predicted bandwidth and\nradar cross section will permit the two data sets\nto be compared. In addition, a number of other\nmeasures of the echo shape (such as skewness\nand internal fluctuation statistics) will be used\nto define lunar-surface characteristics. These steps\nwill be performed for each 10 km of motion of\nthe reflecting area along the lunar surface. The\nmajority of the spectra (such as shown in fig.\n17-7) that appear to originate from fairly homogeneous surface regions will be reduced systematically. Other spectra, such as the data obtained\nfrom Lansberg Crater, will require a more detailed and specialized interpretation.\n\nseries of data samples, then 9ese samples may be\ngrouped according to djn=d6,where i =nN\nj\nfor 1.L N and n, N,and j are all positive integers\nor zero.

Orbital-Science Photography\nPART A\nVOLCANIC FEATURES IN THE FAR-SIDE HIGHLANDS\nFarouk El-Baz a\nThe role of volcanism in the formation and\nmodillcation of lunar-surface features has been\na matter of controversy, especially with regard to\nthe lunar highlands. The relatively younger features in the maria are generally well preserved,\nwhereas those in the highlands are somewhat\nambiguous. However, in a few cases, geomorphology and spatial relationships identify certain features as being of volcanic origin.\nTerrain volcanism has been described in several areas on the near side of the Moon. For\nexample, in reference 18-1, several of the units\nthat form the Kant Plateau materials are attributed\nto volcanism, mainly viscous flows. Two regional\nvolcanic units, one west of Mare Nectaris and the\nother west of Mare Humorum, have also been\nmapped (ref. 18-2). In addition to these units,\nplains-forming materials and deposits that are\nassociated with some craters and rilles mantle the\nlunar terrain. These are also attributed to volcanism as summarized in references 18-3 and 18-4.\nLandforms of probable volcanic origin are also\nquite prevalent on the lunar far side. Some were\nrevealed for the first time in Lunar Orbiter photography (ref. 18-5). Others were depicted by\nApollo 8 photography; for example, the flow\nscarps and cones (ref. 18-6). Still others were\nonly discernible in Apollo 10 photography, as in\nthe case of the deposits related to King Crater, as\nreported in reference 18-7.\nTo test some of the theories regarding far-side\nupland volcanism, three photographic strips were\nplanned for the Apollo 14 mission. The photographic target strips, assigned nos. 14, 3, and 15,\nprovided examples of the far-side highlands from\nBellcomm, Inc.\n\n160\xe2\x80\x9d E to the eastern limb (fig. 18-1). The\nphotographs were taken on the 14th orbit of the\nMoon.\nThe Hasselblad camera with SO-368 color film\nand a 500-mm lens was used. The camera was\nhand held and no spacecraft image-motion compensation was attempted. A ringsight on the\ncamera was used for aiming at the targets. All\nthree strips and two additional targets were successfully acquired, and the quality of the photographs is excellent. The three sequences are\ncovered as follows:\n( 1) Target 14 (west-northwest of Chaplygin\nCrater), frames AS14-72-9947 to 9959\n(2) Target 3 (vicinity of King Crater), frames\nAS14-72-9961 to 9978\n(3) Target 15 (west of Pasteur Crater) ,frames\nAS14-72-9979 to 10003, and northward toward\nthe eastern rim of Mare Smythii, frames AS1472-10004 to 10030\n\nDescription o Features\nf\nProbable volcanic features displayed in these\nphotographs include two conjugate craters westnorthwest of the Chaplygin Crater, a lava lake\nand flow scarps associated with the King Crater,\nvolcanic flows associated with a 35-km crater\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cthe bright one\xe2\x80\x9d by the Apollo 14 crew,\nfurrowed and grooved terrain west of the Pasteur\nCrater, and calderalike craters on the east rim\nof Mare Smythii. Each of these features is discussed in the following paragraphs.\nTwo Conjugate Craters\n\nApproximately 40 km from the northwestern\nrim of Chaplygin Crater are two unnamed con-\n\n267\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n268\n\njugate craters that display unique characteristics.\nThe crater to the north is approximately 35 km in\ndiameter, and the one to the south is 25 km from\nrim to rim. Both craters display fairly smooth rims\nincluding those portions at the juncture between\nthe two craters. The craters are shallow and the\nfloors are contiguous. The floor material is distinctly different from that in neighboring craters.\nIt is somewhat darker than the surrounding material and displays fractures that appear to be endogenetic in origin. The fractures in the crater to\nthe north are concentric with the rim, whereas\n\n0\n\nN-I-S\n6ap \'apn+!+Di\n\n2-\n\nFIGURE 8 - 2 .

As shown\nin figure 18-3(a), the floor displays an elongate\ndepression, approximately 5 km in length, and a\nnumber of rimless and low-rimmed craters. The\nfloor of the smaller crater that is dissected by a\nnetwork of fractures or rilles is shown in figure\n18-3 (b) . These display a V-shaped cross section\nand fairly smooth walls.\nThe aforementioned characteristics lead one to\nthe conclusion that the two conjugate craters are\nprobably of volcanic origin. The floor material is\nmade of volcanic flows, and the fractures are\nprobably shrinkage cracks produced during the\ncooling of the lava. This interpretation is also\nsupported by the fact that the craters do not display signscant rim deposits and that lobate flow\nscarps are distinct within the floor material. The\nmorphology of these flow scarps suggests a somewhat viscous flow.\n\n-\n\nFIGURE\n18-3.-Two\n\n.\n\nKing Crater\n\nKing Crater (formerly International Astronomical Union no. 21 1) is approximately 75 km in\ndiameter and displays a generally round, partly\ncrenulated rim.\nThe crater is situated in as-yet-undivided highland materials in the general area previously\nknown as the Soviet Mountains (ref. 18-8). The\ncrater exhibits a raised, wavy, and sculptured rim\nand terraced interior walls, which indicate, although not unequivocally, an impact origin. It is\nnot discernible in the photographs whether the\ncrater is rayed. The presence of an extensive ray\nsystem is generally regarded as a strong criterion\nfor the impact origin of the younger lunar craters.\nThe crater is a few kilometers deep, and the\ndepth of the floor in relation to the rim crest varies\nwith the amount of fill. The crater wall is terraced\nup to six levels, and the highest terrace is steeper\nthan most, a feature common to craters of similar\nsize. The floor of the crater displays a prominent\ncentral peak that is forked. It forms a unique\nY-shape (fig. 18-4), with the right arm trending\nnearly due north.\n\nhigh-resolution frames of different portions of the conjugate craters shown\nin figure 18-2.

(b) The Y-shaped central mountain\nand dark pool on the north rim (AS14-71-9851).\n\nOn the basis of Apollo 10 photography, four\ndifferent types of materials had already been noted\nin the walls of the crater (ref. 18-7). These types\nwere distinguished by color, texture, and morphology. Also, some tabular bodies of high albedo\nmaterials and wall-like bodies that cross the walls,\nrim, and floor materials were described as igneous\nintrusions. The interpretation of these features as\nigneous intrusions was used as supportive indications of the heterogeneity of lunar materials, as\n\nwell as the plausibility of intrusive igneous activity\non the Moon (ref. 18-7).\nThe Apollo 14 high-resolution photographs constitute a useful complement to existing imagery of\nthe crater and environs. The high obliquity of the\nphotographs. (approximately 60") enhances details that were unnoticeable previously. A mosaic\nof the oblique photographic strip is shown in\nfigure 18-5. This view provides additional evidence\nto the previously stated interpretation of the dark\nmaterials on the north rim of the crater. The flat,\nrelatively smooth appearance of this material and\nthe collapsed sinuous depressions within the unit\nindicate that the material originated as a lava lake.\nSome flow scarps are noticeable within and around\nthe borders of this unit.\nAn additional flow scarp can be seen for the\nfirst time to the southwest of the crater. The nature\nof the lobate flow fronts is made obvious by the\nobliquity of the view. This particular scarp, however, may represent the terminus of a debris flow\nor rock glacier.\n"The Bright One"\n\nThe so-called bright crater is a young (Copernican) crater. Although the crater is only 35 km\nin diameter, its bright halo dominates a surrounding area of approximately 150 km in diameter (fig.\n18-6). Its rays, as well as those of a neighboring,\nsomewhat smaller crater approximately 50 km to\nthe northeast, join the rays from Bruno Crater to\nthe north. This bright area of the lunar far side\n(at high Sun) was erroneously interpreted as the\nSoviet Mountains, a mountain range not related\nto a circular basin. However, Apollo photographs\nshowed that the bright region is due mainly to\ncrater rays (ref. 18-8).\n\nFIGURE\n18-5.--0blique view of King Crater (AS14-71-9967 to 9972).\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\n\n271\n\nFIGURE\n18-6.-Bruno\nand Tsiolkovsky Craters and a halo\naround a young crater.

(b) A bright halo, approximately 150 km in diameter,\nthat surrounds a young crater located at latitude 5" S longi,\ntude 123" E (AS8-12-2189).\n\nThe bright crater displays an irregular shape\nbecause of slumping of the wall materials (fig.\n18-7). The rim crest is very sharp and the crenulations are wavy. The high-resolution photograph\ntaken during acquisition of target 3 (King Crater)\nto the north reveals interesting details of the crater\ninterior. As the spacecraft moved over the crater,\nthe command module pilot (CMP) swung the\ncamera down to acquire the photograph and swung\nit back to complete the King Crater photostrip.\nAs shown in figure 18-8, the interior of the\ncrater is very hummocky. The lack of a flat floor\n\nis striking and the excessive terracing is unique.\nProminent flow scarps can be seen, and flow fronts\nare not always lobate; one major front is unusually straight. Small fractures apparently caused\nby drag can be seen in the main flow in the upper\nright portion of the frame. The unusually large\nquantity of blocks on the terraces and the virtual\nlack of craters suggest that this is an extremely\nyoung crater. These characteristics, when coupled\nwith the gross morphology, provide evidence that\nKing Crater is the youngest lunar crater of its\nsize range ever photographed.\n\n272\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n18-7.-View\nof the bright-haloed crater ("the\nFIGURE\nbright one") shown in figure 18-6 (80-mm lens was\nused).

A raised flow scarp is in\nthe middle of the photograph, and numerous blocks are\nevident on the terraces (AS14-72-9975).\n\nFIGURE\n18-9.-Elongate\ndepression, furrows, and grooves in hilly terrain northwest of Pasteur\nCrater (AS14-72-9993, left: AS14-72-10000, right).\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\nElongate Grooves\n\nSeveral small elongate grooves and depressions\nwere noted within the my\nof\nPasteur Crater. The grooves and furrows range\nbetween\nand 30 km, as revealed by Lunar\nOrbiter photography. The exact morphology of\nthese grooves and furrows was, however, not discernible and their origin not known.\nThe Apollo 1 4 high-resolution stereophotographs reveal that these elongate features are of\nprobable volcanic origin. The unit in which these\ngrooves are located is somewhat hilly and displays characteristics reminiscent of the Kant\nPlateau materials (ref. 18-1). Similar units also\nexist in the far-side highland farther east. Most\nof the grooves display a raised rim, and many have\nthe appearance of conjugate crater chains (fig.\n18-9).\nTerrestrial analogs to these features are formed\nby eruptions of magmas of intermediate composition. Although the nature of the material is not\n\n273\n\nknown, the morphology of these lunar features\nstrongly suggests a volcanic origin.\nThe larger of the furrowlike craters and most\nsmaller grooves are oriented in a north-south\ndirection. Indications are that the craters are\nstructurally controlled and that a tectonic belt\nwith north-south fractures exists in this area. It is\nfurther speculated that that tectonic belt may be a\nphysical expression of a dividing line between a\nthick crust in the far side and a thinner \'Iust in\nthe near sideEast Rim of Mare Smythii\n\nMare Smythii, a near-circular basin, displays\nunits with varying albedo. Near the eastern rim\nof the basin are somewhat hummocky units of\nhigh albedo. They are somewhat similar to the\nplains-forming units within large craters and appear to be made of older mare material. One\nexample of the type of terrain is shown in figure\n\nFIGURE\n18-10.-Probable volcanic features near the eastern rim of Mare Smythii. (a) A sinuous depression (AS14-72-10008).

Although no distinct flows are\nof flooded craters exist in\ndecipherable,\nthe mare itself, as shown in figure 18-10. These\nmultiringed craters appear to have been formed\n\nby eruptions and successive collapses much like\ncalderas on Earth. They do not display hummocky ejecta on the rims, and no indications of\nan impact origin can be seen. Similar, but less\ndistinct, craters on the east rim of Mare Smythii\ncan be seen, and the setting also suggests that these\ncraters are calderas formed by volcanic eruptions.\n\nPART B\nPRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC RESULTS FROM ORBITAL PHOTOGRAPHY\nD . H . Scott," M . N . West," B. K . Lucchitta," and J . F . McCauley a\n\nNew geologic features as well as previously\nunrecognized details on the morphology, structure, and stratigraphy of the Moon were revealed\nduring the preliminary examination of more than\n800 Apollo 14 70-mm Hasselblad photographs.\nThe photographs strengthen or, in some cases,\nrefine previous interpretations of the origin and\nrelative ages of many of the geologic units previously mapped on the near side. The new orbital\nphotography has also enhanced knowledge of the\nprocesses involved in the emplacement of these\nunits. Certain photographs suggest that some previous interpretations should be reconsidered or\nmodsed to accommodate the new relationships\nshown more clearly by the Apollo 14 orbital\nphotography. Only the most visually dramatic\nexamples of this new and useful collection of photographs have been selected for annotation.\nOne of the most significant new features, particularly with respect to the site chosen for the\nApollo 15 landing (Apennine-Hadley region), is\na sinuous rille that has distinct continuous levees\nextending along the entire length. One sinuous\nrille with a distinct, but only partly leveed, channel\nin the Marius Hills region had previously been\ndescribed (ref. 18-9). The narrow but continuous\noverbank deposit along the rille, shown in color\nphotography AS14-73-10120 to 10122 (fig.\nU S Geological Survey.\n..\n\n18-11), has not been seen in previous photographs. This rille is relatively small (approximately\n15 km long by 700 m wide) and begins and ends\nin mare material that embays the southeast rim\nof Lansberg Crater. The narrow width of the\nlevees (approximately 100 m) contrasts sharply\nwith the relatively broad ridges commonly asso-\n\nFIGURE 1 . S i n u o u s rille with leveed channels in\n18-1\nmare material near Lansberg Crater (north toward\nupper right; AS14-73-10120).\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nciated with terrestrial collapsed lava tubes (ref.\n18-10). The levees more closely resemble those\nassociated with stream channels, lava channels,\nand certain types of highly fluid debris and mud\nflows. The fluidization-channel hypothesis (ref.\n18-1 1) could be applicable in light of these new\nphotographs. The arguments put forth (ref. 1812) in support of a collapsed-lava-tube origin for\nthe leveeless Hadley rille do apply to the majority\nof sinuous rilles previously photographed but are\nnot applicable to this newly noted feature. Three\nalternative explanations present themselves with\nregard to sinuous rilles as a result of the three\ncited photographs.\n(1) Two genetically distinct classes of lunar\nsinuous rilles exist; those without levees are collapsed subsurface lava tubes or flow channels as\nsuggested in reference 18-12.\n(2) Rilles with levees or overbank deposits are\nthe results of surface fluid flow in open channels\nwith the fluid medium possibly, but not necessarily, consisting of lavas.\n(3) Alternatively, partly leveed rilles may have\nformed by both open-channel and subsurface lava\nflow, or some other type of flowage may be\ninvolved.\nThe lunar surface may contain many more\nleveed rilles that have not been detected in previous photographs because of inadequate resolution or lighting problems. The previously mentioned alternatives are discussed in part G of this\nsection. Orbital photography and the surface\nstudies planned at the Apollo 15 site may help\nto clarify the origin of these still-enigmaticfeatures.\nA distinct color anomaly can be seen in photographs (AS14-73-10142 to 10148) of the eastern\nwall of Langrenus Crater. A distinct rusty color\nis evident in one of a group of smooth bulbous\ndomes with single or multiple furrows at or near\nthe crests (fig. 18-12). Except for the dome\nexhibiting the color anomaly, all have a lightgray, faintly speckled appearance. These domes\nappear morphologically distinct from the sharper\ncrested, more irregular hills that lie concentrically\naround the inner wall of Langrenus Crater and\nthat are evidently slump blocks from the crater\nwalls.\nThe rusty color in the domelike hill is evident\nin all seven of the cited photographs. A patch of\n\n275\n\nFIGURE\n18-12,East\nwall of Langrenus Crater. The\ncolor anomaly is located at point 1; bulbous domes on\ncrater floor, at point 2; and typical slump blocks from\ncrater walls, at point 3 (north toward upper left; A S 1 6\n73-1 0142).\n\ndark material at the estimated location of this\ndome can be seen in Apollo photograph AS1032-4676, thus confirming that the anomaly is not\nan artifact of the color photographs. The color\nanomaly may be of little regional geologic significance. However, in reference 18-13, it is pointed\nout that color differences on the lunar surface are\nn\nattributable to gross differences i petrologic composition. The location of the dark material among\na group of morphologically distinctive bulbous\nstructures suggests that post-Langrenus endogenetic processes may be responsible for both the\ndomes and the color anomaly.\nAnother, but less distinctive, color anomaly is\nevident in the young, small, 4 - b , dark-halo\nBeaumont L Crater (fig. 18-1 3 ) . The crater walls\nexhibit horizontal, wavy, locally discontinuous,\nalternating dark and rusty-colored bands, and the\ncrater floor has a brownish hue. The implications\nof this color anomaly are even less clear than\nthose of the anomaly previously described. The\nrusty appearance of the crater interior may be\nattributed to its apparent youth, if the experiments discussed in reference 18-14 are applicable. More recently formed, bright-appearing\n\n276\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nFIGURE18-13.-Beaumont\nL Crater (4-km diameter)\nwith dark halo and interior. The arrow points to the\ncolor anomaly in walls (north approximately toward\nright; AS14-73-10040).\n\ncolored features show that variations of spectral\nreflectivity are locally intense enough to be recorded on photographic color emulsions. These\ntwo areas are thus appropriate targets for further\ncolor and multispectral orbital experiments.\nf\nThe Beaumont L Crater is o additional interest\nbecause of the dark halo. In reference 18-1, the\nnearby 7.5-km bright crater Cyrillus G (fig. 1814) is considered to be of impact origin; Beaumont\nL Crater, on the other hand, was considered as\nbeing of questionable origin although both craters\nare obviously of Copernican age because they lie\non the ejecta blanket of Theophilus, a Copernican\ncrater. Beaumont L Crater is considered the\nyounger of the two on the basis of fewer superposed impact craters (light speckles) on the dark\nhalo. Cyrillus G Crater appears to have as many\nsmall craters on its surrounding ejecta blanket\nas are present on the surrounding terrain. Similar\nmorphologies of the latter two craters, despite\nthe color and albedo disparities, strongly suggest\nthat both are of impact origin. Cyrillus G appears\nto penetrate light-hued terrain composed, in this\narea, mainly of older crater deposits, whereas\nBeaumont L Crater excavated dark mare material\nfrom beneath the Theophilus Crater ejecta blanket.\n\nFIGURE\n18-14.-Cyrillus G Crater (7.5-km diameter)\nnear Beaumont L Crater (north toward lower right;\nAS14-73-10047).\n\ncraters, as measured from telescope data, are the\nmost colorful of lunar features (ref. 18-13).\nColor differences on the Moon in the visible\nrange of the spectrum were previously measured\ninstrumentally (refs. 18-13 to 18-15). The two\n\nFIGURE\n18-15.-Floor of Alphonsus Crater showing a\nsmooth-rimmed dark-halo crater with dark interior\nwalls at point 1 and a typical bright-walled impact\ncrater at point 2 (north toward right; AS14-73-10093).\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nThe origin of dark-halo craters has been a longstanding problem since the early days of telescopic\ngeologic mapping, when all such craters were\nnecessarily considered to be maars (ref. 18-1 6 ) .\nThe Ranger and Lunar Orbiter mission results\nsubsequently suggested that at least two varieties\nof dark-halo craters exist on the Moon. The mapping of Alphonsus Crater at the 1:250 000 scale\n(ref. 18-17) showed that most of the dark-halo\ncraters on its floor were structurally controlled.\nThe mapping of the northeastern part of the floor\nof Alphonsus Crater at the 1 :50 000 scale (ref.\n18-1 8) indicated that the dark-halo craters, particularly the Alphonsus MD Crater, were morphologically distinct from the dark-halo craters\npresent on the ejecta blankets of Theophilus\n(Beaumont L, for example) and Copernicus\ncraters. The Alphonsus-type craters are gently\nconvex upward from the edge of the recognizable\ndark blanket inward to the crater lip, whereas\nthe latter are pronouncedly concave upward. In\naddition, Earth-based full-Moon photography indicated that the Alphonsus-type crater has dark\ninterior walls as opposed to the bright interiors\nof the Copernicus- and Theophilus-type craters.\nThe relatively poor resolution of the Earth-based\nphotography precluded the deveIopment of a\nstrong observational case for these differences in\nthe reflectivity of the crater interiors. An excellent\nsequence of near-down-Sun oblique pictures of the\nAlphonsus dark-halo craters (fig. 18-1 5 ) are\nprovided in photographs AS14-73-10090 to\n10097. In successive photographs, the Sun-facing\ninterior slopes of Alphonsus KC Crater are distinctly seen to be nearly as dark as the surrounding\nrim deposits. This observation suggests that the\nsame type of material drapes both surfaces, as\nis the case with well-preserved terrestrial volcanic\ncraters. Apollo 14 photography has thus strengthened the hypothesis that at least two basic varieties\nof dark craters are indeed present on the Moon.\nCertain impact events penetrate and excavate\nintrinsically dark subjacent materials that are\ndeposited mostly within the ejecta blankets ; the\nsteeper, more brecciated and unstable interior\nwalls brighten quickly by mass wasting, thus exposing blocks and in\nhe uppermost\nlayers Of bedrock. The lower interior slopes are\ntalus covered. Certain volcanic craters bring up\n\n277\n\nmaterial of uniformly dark albedo and distribute\nthis tephra more or less uniformly over the interior\nwalls of the vent and in the surrounding dark\nblanket. It appears that, as these volcanic craters\nage by meteoritic churning of the surface, the\nsurrounding blankets and interior walls become\nlighter and less distinguishable from the surrounding terrain (on the basis of albedo), but they\ngenerally retain the convex upward profiles. These\ntwo classes of craters are obviously distinguishable\nonly by use of a variety of both high- and lowSun-illuminated photographs in addition to the\nhigh-resolution obliques.\nColor photograph AS14-73-10145 shows inclined layering within the central peak of Langrenus Crater similar to that recognized previously\nin the famous Lunar Orbiter 2 oblique photograph\nof Copernicus Crater (ref. 18-5). The Apollo\n14 photograph (fig. 18-16) is superior in detail\n(taken from an opposite viewpoint, the southwest)\nto the Apollo 10 photographs of Langrenus Crater.\nThe face of a steep-walled ridge in the northern\npart of the central peak complex shows, from top\nto bottom, the following discrete units:\n\n8-1 &antra1\npeak of Langrenus crater,\nviewed from the southwest. The curved ridge in the\nnorthern part of the peak assemblage measures approximately 13 km in an east-west direction; points 1\nto 4 refer to stratification xeen on the ridge face as\ndescribed in text.

The existence of this\nstratification is consistent with an impact origin\nfor the craters and the origin of central peaks\nby rebound of deep-seated target materials that\nmaintain stratigraphic identity.\nDark material that covers terraces and fresh\nscarps on the wall of the west rim of Langrenus\nCrater is shown in figure 18-17. The dark material\nextends as diffuse inward-facing lobes as far as\n\nFIGURE\n18-17.-Dark materials extending from west rim\nof Langrenus Crater into the crater floor.

The diffuse dark lobes extend\ndown and across the faces of multiple slump scars\nand apparently terminate on the crater floor. These\ncharacteristics indicate postcrater modification by\nlava flows, pyroclastics, or highly mobile debris\nflows.\nOf interest in terms of surface processes is the\nyoung Zollner DC Crater (fig. 18-18). The\nZollner DC Crater, approximately 5 km in diameter, is superposed on complex terrain materials\nin the Descartes region. The southeast part of the\nrim, wall, and floor have been buried by a postcrater deposit that appears to originate near the\ncrestline of a far more ancient and larger crater\nthat lies immediately to the southeast. The material apparently is mass-wasted debris that accumulated shortly after the crater formed. Numerous\nexamples of partial crater destruction on sloping\nsurfaces have been seen in previous orbital photographs. The infilling always takes place from the\nhigher ground, and this phenomenon has been\nused by a number of authors to explain the relative paucity of craters in the more rugged parts\nof the terrain. This photograph provides a more\ndramatic example of crater filling than many\npreviously available photographs.\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\n\n279\n\nFIGURE\n18-19.-Oblique views of Alpetragius Crater (40-km diameter). (a) Sharp rim crest on\nnorth side shown at point 1 (AS14-73-10095). (b) Subdued rim on south side (point 2);\nunusually large central peak shown at point 3 (AS14-73-10096).\n\nThe relative ages of Aipetragius and ArzacheI\nCraters (shown on the nearly vertical Lunar\nOrbiter 4 photographs) have troubled many photoinvestigators. Alpetragius Crater has generally\nbeen mapped as the younger of the two, but it\nbelongs to a class of lunar craters with unusually\nprominent central peaks, of which a dozen or so\nexamples exist on the near sid?. An oblique view\nof Alpetragius Crater (fig. 18-19(a)) shows a\nsharp-appearing rim crest along the northwest\nwall of the crater. The southeast side of the crater\n(fig. 18-1 9 (b) ) toward Arzachel Crater clearly\nexhibits a more rounded and subdued rim crest.\nThus, despite the apparent youth of, and the apparent superposition on, the rim deposits of\nArzachel Crater (as determined from analysis of\nLunar Orbiter 4 photographs), Alpetragius Crater\nmight be the older crater with the southeast wall\ndegraded by the later Arzachel Crater event. These\nobservations attest to the utility of repeated photography of the same regions from different angles.\nFine details in the ejecta pattern of rim material\naround the Copernican crater Lansberg A are\nshown in figure 18-20. The low-Sun illumination\nof 8" accentuates the braided and radially ridged\ntexture of this 10-km crater. The pattern bears\na striking resemblance to that around the smaller\nMosting C Crater as shown in reference 18-5.\nCraters formed in mare\nusuallY exhibit\na remnant rim crest even\nthey may be\ndeeply embayed by younger mare flows. The small\n\nfresh crater ( 3 km in diameter) immediately east\nof Lansberg A Crater shows no evidence of any\nraised rim deposit, yet it appears to truncate the\nrim material of Lansberg A Crater. Some of these\nrimless craters and many rimless bowl-shaped\ndepressions have been noted on previous orbital\nphotographs. An excellent example of a rimless\n\nFIGURE\n18-20.-Rim\ndeposits of the presumed impact\ncrater Lansberg A, at point 1;\nsharp, rimless\ncrater apparently superposed on rim material at point\n2.

Still\nanother is situated near the Marius Hills, just\nnorth of the rille shown in Lunar Orbiter 4 highresolution photograph 157-H, (northeast corner).\nA slight darkening is sometimes observed around\nthe rims. This type crater is difficult to explain\nas being of impact origin; such craters may be\nanalogous to certain terrestrial maars in which\ngas has been\'the major discharge product, and\nsolid materials, mostly quarried from the vent\nwalls, are subordinate in amount.\nA number of elongate, somewhat triangular\npatches of bright-ray material can be seen in\nfigure 18-2 1 . These elongate patches can be traced\neastward and are radial to Lalande Crater outside\nthe photograph. The principle of superposition is\nwell illustrated because the rays from Lalande\nCrater in this photograph clearly lie across rays\nand secondary crater clusters identified with\nCopernicus Crater, located approximately 450 km\nto the north. Thus, the relative ages of these two\ncraters are established by simple superposition\nrelations.\nDavy G Crater is an irregularly shaped crater\n\nFIGURE\n18-21.-Ray\nmaterial from Lalande Crater superposed on secondary impact craters (points 1 and 2)\nfrom Copernicus Crater. Both Lalande and Copernicus\nCraters are outside of photograph (north toward top;\nAS14-70-98 12).\n\nFIGURE\n18-22.-Davy Crater chain at point 1 and Davy\nG Crater at point 2 (north toward right; AS14-7310102).\n\napproximately 15 km long, lying along the eastward extension of a chain of smaller craters referred to as the Davy Crater chain (fig. 18-22).\nAll these craters appear to be relatively young\n(late- to post-Imbrian) and are considered by\nsome investigators to be of volcanic origin (ref.\n18-19). An unusual view of the walls of Davy\nG Crater under varying illumination angles is\nafforded in the photograph. At near-grazing Sun\nincidence, the partly shadowed wall has a rough,\nheated appearance wherein the dominant texture\nconsists of grooves extending from rim crest to\ncrater floor. Aside from a slight mottling, the\nbright sunlit walls appear smooth and resemble\nthose of most young lunar craters viewed under\nhigh-Sun angles. This observation is in accord\nwith the high infrared thermal response and radar\nreflectivity that are generally attributed to the\nrough and blocky interiors of young craters.\nFar-side photographs show exceptional details\non the rim, walls, and floor of the bright-rayed\ncrater (latitude 5" S, longitude 123" E) that\nforms one of the two extensive ray systems in the\nMontes Sovietici briefly discussed in references\n18-8 and 18-20. The crater is best shown under\na relatively low illumination angle ( 17 " ) in figure\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\n\n281\n\n(ref. 18-21), was formed by impact. A different\nand more highly oblique view of the central\nridge of this crater is shown in figure 18-26 in\n\nFIGURE\n18-23.4opernican-age crater (35-km diameter)\nforming one of the major ray systems on lunar far side.\nPoint 1 indicates uppermost scarp of a series of slump\nterraces; point 2, a secondary crater loop; and point 3,\nradial-rim facies (north right of top center; AS14-709671).\n\n18-23. The crater has a rim-crest diameter of approximately 35 km, but the general outline is\npartly distorted by incipient major wall failure and\nslumping. Looped secondary crater chains, a\nbraided radial facies, finely terraced walls, and\nmajor fracture patterns are clearly seen. The\ninterior terraces within this crater generally trend\nto the northwest, as opposed to the usual concentric terraces seen in craters of similar age in\nthis size range. In this case, it is evident that most\nof the postcrater gravitational filling occurred by\nthe collapse of the partly shadowed wall.\nDistant photographs of the Moon provide regional views in which only the gross morphology\nof the larger features is accentuated. An unusually\nprominent ridge (ref. 18-7) extending across the\nfloor of the large 75-km King Crater is shown in\nfigure 18-24. Higher resolution photography (fig.\n18-25) shows the ropy structure of the ridge that,\nin places, seems to be draped over the massive\ncentral peak.\nA radial facies and secondary craters extend\nbeyond the prominent rim, indicating that King\nCrater, which appears to be of late Imbrian age\n\nFIGURE\n18-24.-Distant\nposttransearth-injection photograph showing King Crater (75-km diameter) with\nprominent ridge on floor (north toward upper left;\nAS 1 4-7 5- 10307).\n\nFIGURE\n18-25.--High-resolution\nphotograph of King\nCrater showing central ridge at point 1, central peak\nat point 2, radial faces at point 3, and secondary\ncraters at point 4 (AS14-71-9851).\n\n282\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nFIGURE\n18-26.-Oblique\nview of King Crater showing\nslumped near wall at point 1, dark blotches on far wall\nat point 2, and central ridge and peak at point 3\n(AS10-29-4209).\n\nwhich the ropy, convoluted character of the ridge\nmaterial is not as evident; in this photograph, the\nmaterial more nearly resembles a large slide mass\nextending from crater wall to central peak. The\nlight-hued inclined band shown at point 3 in figure\n18-26 may be an interbedded unit or dike. This\nband appears to lie across the central peak shown\nin figure 18-25 and texturally resembles the ropy\nmaterial. A wide (approximately 10 km) dark\nband extends across the floor of King Crater and\nup the far northern wall where it continues for\nsome distance into the hilly terrain in the background. Small, very dark patches occur along the\ncentral ridge and peak as well as in the waIls and\nfloor of the crater. The patches do not appear\nstratified and might, therefore, represent local\nzones of postcrater volcanic modification (ref.\n18-7). Additional orbital photography of this\ncrater under a wide variety of lighting conditions\nwould be useful, particularly in the case of the\ncentral ridge.\nVertical stereophotography made with the Hycon lunar topographic camera began at the northeast rim of Theophilus Crater and, because of\na camera malfunction, ended just east of the candidate Apollo landing site in the Descartes region.\nThe approximate scale of the frames varies from\n1 :48 000 to 1 :37 000 with a recognition resolution\n\nFIGURE\n18-27.-Track (point 1) of large boulder (point\n2) that rolled down northeast wall of Theophilus\nCrater (AS14-80-10448).\n\nFIGURE\n18-28.-Prominent, bright, central peak in small\ncrater on floor of Theophilus Crater (AS14-80-104.54).\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nof 2.5 to 1.9 m (Apollo 14 Preliminary Photographic Index) . Interesting details of lunar-surface\ntexture and small-crater morphology are seen in\nmost of the photographs. A track made by a large\nboulder (approximately 20 m in diameter) as it\nrolled down the northeast wall of Theophilus\nCrater is shown in figure 18-27. The boulder track\nhas been studied in detail (ref. 18-22) and was\nfound to be helpful in estimating the soil properties\nof the lunar surface.\n\n283\n\nThe floor of Theophilus Crater contains a small\n(800-m) crater that is unusual because of the\nprominent, smooth-surfaced, bright central peak\n(fig. 18-28). On a small scale, it resembles the\ntype of crater exemplified by Alpetragius Crater,\ndiscussed earlier. Fresh rock may actually be exposed in the upper bright portion of the peak as\na result of downslope shedding of fragmental\nmaterial. Blocks are clearly visible on the crater\nwall.\n\nPART C\nHYCON PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS\nFarouk El-Baz and J . W . Head I11 a\n\nDuring the Apollo 14 mission, the lunar topographic camera (LTC) recorded the first highresolution strip photography of the lunar surface.\nThe stereophotographs cover a segment of the\ncentral lunar highlands from the eastern rim of\nTheophilus Crater to a point northwest of Kant\nCrater. The photography will be of value in detailed studies pertaining to the geologic units of\nthis part of the Moon. The purpose of this paper\nis to summarize the preliminary geologic analysis\nby citing examples of terrain characteristics as revealed in the LTC photographs.\nThe LTC has an 18-in. focal-length f/4 lens.\nAn automatic rocking mount compensates for\nforward motion of the spacecraft over the lunar\nsurface during exposure by keeping +he camera\npointed directly at the object being photographed.\nThe photographs discussed in this section were\ntaken during the fourth orbit when the command\nand service module (CSM) was approximately\n18 km above the lunar surface. Black-and-white\ntype-3400 film was used at a 65-frame/min rate\nand at a shutter speed of 1/200 sec to obtain these\nphotographs. A camera malfunction resulted in\noverexposure of the last half of the film magazine.\nThe correctly exposed half of the magazine (ap\'\' Bellcomm, Inc.\n\nproximately 200 frames) is discussed in this\nsection.\nThe high-resolution stereostrip (approximately\n60 percent sidelap) covers an area approximately\n4 km wide from latitude 11.3" S, longitude 28.2"\nE, to latitude 8.3" S, longitude 18.7" E. The\ncontrast is low because the Sun-elevation angle\nvaried between approximately 45" at the beginning of the strip to 35" at the end of the properly\nexposed frames.\n\nPreliminary Analysis\nThe highland terrain covered by the photographs (fig. 18-29) , at approximately 2-m resolution, includes two major units: TheophiIus Crater\nejecta and Kant Plateau materials. A ridge was\noverflown when the camera was malfunctioning,\nand, consequently, an area equivalent to the\ncoverage of 15 frames was not photographed. This\nridge, however, is discernible in Lunar Orbiter\n4 and Apollo (Hasselblad) photographs at much\nlower resolution.\nTheophilus Crater materials are represented by\nthe walls, floor, and the western ejecta blanket of\nthe crater. The ejecta blanket may, in turn, be\ndivided into a hummocky unit near the rim crest\nand a smoother facies farther away. The second\nmajor unit is that of the Kant Plateau materials.\n\n284\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nE~\n\nU R E\n18-29.-Are a of photographic coverag;e 1includes\nTheophilus Crater ejec:ta and Kant Plateau materials.\nDots show subspac:ecra ft points of photogra1)hs AS1480-10436 to AS14-80- 10642.\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\n\n285\n\nThe plateau is topographically higher than the\nsurrounding terrain and includes plains-forming\nunits and other subdued ridges. Following are\ndescriptions of examples of the two major units.\nJheophilos Crater and Ejecta\n\nTheophilus Crater is a relatively young (Copernican-age) 100-km-diameter crater of probable\nimpact origin. Located in the northwest rim of the\nNectaris Basin, the crater displays an ejecta\nblanket, terraced walls, a flat floor, and central\npeaks, all of which are characteristic of major\nlunar craters.\nThe eastern rim of Theophilus Crater is particularly well illustrated in frames AS14-8010437 and 10438 in which the characteristics of\nthe crater rim, rim crest, and the inner crater wall\nmay be seen. In the right-hand portion of figure\n18-30, the crater rim is characterized by relatively\nsmooth, nontextured material that contains a wide\nspectrum of crater sizes and ages. The crater walls,\nhowever, are sloping and highly textured with a\ntreebarklike pattern, evidently indicative of downslope movement of material along the terraces.\n\nFIGURE\n18-30.-Eastern\n(AS1 4-80-1 0437).\n\nrim\n\nof Theophilus Crater\n\nFIGURE\n18-31.-Numerous linear arrangements of blocks\non the rim of Theophilus Crater (AS14-80-10441).\n\nNumerous large blocks are also seen in the crater\nwalls. The number of craters seen on the crater\nwalls is much lower than that on the crater rim.\nThis distribution is due, in most part, to the differences in slope. Also, virtually all craters on the\nwalls appear to have been modified so that the\nupslope sides are either smoother and less pronounced or are obliterated altogether. Two 300to 400-m-diameter craters at the crater-rim crest\n(fig. 18-30) illustrate this modification well. The\ncrater to the east is slightly modified from the\ncircular form, while the wall of the adjacent crater\nhas been highly modified in an upslope direction.\nThe crater-distribution variations and the modification of craters on the wall are attributed to\ndownslope movement of debris, which causes\nfilliig and ultimate erasure of many craters on the\ninterior walls of Theophilus Crater. Progressive\nstages of modification are evident in the three\nlarge craters (250- to 400-m diameter) located on\nthe Theophilus Crater rim (fig. 18-30). Downslope movement of material is encroaching and\nfilling craters On the terrace edgesOn the crater terraces, numerous linear arrange-\n\n286\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nments of blocks exist that are interpreted as outcrops of layers or ledges (fig. 18-31). As shown\nin figure 18-32, blocks up to at least 25 m in\ndiameter are visible in the wall terraces. A spectacular boulder track or trail at least 200 m in\nlength can be seen in the central part of the figure.\nThe floor of Theophilus Crater is generally\nsmooth east of the central peaks. The craters in\nthis unit displa blocky rims (photograph AS14Y.\n80-10454), which suggest that the regolith is\nprobably relatively thin. Domed floors are seen in\nseveral craters in the 200- to 400-m-diameter\nrange (fig. 18-32). A flat-floored crater approximately 500 m in diameter can be seen in photograph AS14-80-10460.\nSeveral large craters approximately 500 m in\ndiameter occur where the CSM ground track\ncrosses the base of the central peaks. Numerous\nblocks are visible on these crater rims as well as\nalong the basal slopes of the central peak as shown\nin figure 18-33.\nWest of the central peaks, domical hills within\nthe floor materials occur in considerably greater\nabundance than they do to the east. Typical\n\nFIGURE\n18-33.-Blocks\non the crater rims and basal\nslopes of central peaks of several large craters in floor\nof Theophilus Crater (AS14-80-10466).\n\ndomical hills approximately 500 m in diameter\ncan be seen slightly separated from the central\npeaks in photograph AS14-80-10470.

The southern rim and portion of the wall of Theophilus B Crater are shown\nin figure 18-34. Of particular interest are the\nlarge blocks that occur on the interior wall and\nrim deposits. Apparent layering exists at several\nareas on the crater interior. Several large boulders,\nsomewhat greater than 10 m in diameter, show\nwell-developed fillets (photograph AS 14-8010493, northeast part).\nThe western rim crest (photograph AS14-8010495) of Theophilus Crater displays characteristics similar to those described for the eastern\nrim, although the difference in illumination of\nslopes obscures some wall detail in the west.\nThe characteristic hummocky rim deposits of\nlarge craters is less distinctly developed or preserved at Theophilus Crater. However, a generally\nhummocky rim pattern exists (photograph AS1480-10497). The smooth, poollike mapped areas\n(ref. 18-1 ) on the north rim of Theophilus Crater\ndo not occur on the western rim. A small chain of\nprobable secondary craters of uncertain source is\nvisible on the rim (photograph AS14-80-10503);\n\nother crater clusters and blocky craters can be\nseen in the hummocky crater-rim deposits (photographs AS14-80-10500 to 10505 and AS14-8010511).\nAn old, extremely subdued crater (Cyrillus M)\nis superposed by the rim deposits of Theophilus\nCrater. The rim of Cyrillus M Crater is particularly\nprominent in photograph AS14-80-10519; a\ncrater approximately 2 km in diameter is evident\nin the Theophilus Crater rim. The area to the east\nof this crater appears smooth (photographs AS1480-10511 to 10516) (fig. 18-35). The texture\nmay be the result of ponding of Theophilus Crater\nejecta in the floor of Cyrillus M Crater or of postcratering modifications of low-lying areas.\n\nFIGURE\n18-35.-Smooth\narea east of crater in rim of\nTheophilus Crater (AS14-80-515).\n\nFIGURE\n18-36.-The larger craters on the margins of the\nTheophilus Crater ejecta blanket (AS14-80-10529).\n\nKanf Plateau Materials\n\nNumerous interesting craters occur on the\nmargins of the hummocky Theophilus Crater\nejecta blanket in an area mapped as Kant Plateau\n(ref. 18-1). These craters appear to be part of a\nunit described as densely pitted and interpreted as\nrepresenting craters and associated materials produced by explosive maar-type volcanism. The\nsmaller craters (less than 500 m in diameter) are\nalined (photograph AS 14-80-1 0525 ) and are\n\n288\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\ncharacterized by soft, rounded rims; lack of floors;\nand by nonterraced walls that are funnel shaped or\noften Y-shaped. The larger craters, 0.5 to 2 km\nin diameter (photographs AS14-80-10527 to\n10529), have similar characteristics with the nonfloored funnel- and Y-shaped aspect more apparent (fig. 18-36). Whatever the original shape of\nthe craters, it is evident that considerable mass\nwasting has occurred in generally noncohesive material to produce the crater morphologies seen in\nphotographs AS14-80-10527 to 10529. A few\nkilometers to the east, the largest crater in the\narea (approximately 2 km in diameter; photograph AS14-80-10535) displays a nearly flat but\nslightly domed floor, although the crater rim and\nwalls are similar to those of smaller craters.\nThe terrain toward Kant E Crater to the west\nis cratered and hummocky. The terrain is generally\nundistinguished by any major feature and may\nhave been smoothed over by a thin blanket of\nTheophilus Crater ejecta (photographs AS 14-8015037 to 10557).\nA change in regional slope is evident in photographs AS14-80-10561, near the base of Kant C\nCrater; a corresponding change in surface texture\n\nFIGURE\n18-37.-Modifications by mass wasting of 200to 400-m craters on the slopes of Kant C Crater (AS1480-10563).\n\nto the treebark type can also be seen. Of particular\ninterest in this area are the modifications, by mass\nwasting, of 200- to 400-m craters on the slopes\n(fig. 18-37). These craters have the Y-shaped\ninteriors characteristic of several craters a few\nkilometers to the east. They also share the characteristics of craters developed on steep slopes such\nas those described in the east wall of Theophilus\nCrater. In this instance, the upslope rims are subdued and the upslope walls are much less steep\nthan the downslope walls. The point of inflection\nat the crater bottom appears to migrate downslope\nas the crater ages. Additional movement down the\nside slopes of the crater may produce additional\nlines of inflection producing a Y-shaped interior\ncontour. A camera malfunction, for a total of 15\nframes, precluded photography of the remainder\nof this terrain, which includes a ridge of possible\npre-Imbrian age.\nNorth of Kant Crater, near Kant M Crater, the\nterrain is again hummocky and undistinguished\nwith the exception of the rim and interior wall of\npart of a crater visible in photographs AS14-80-\n\nFIGURE\n18-38.-Broad\nridges associated with Kant N\nand Kant G Craters (AS14-80-10589).\n\n289\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nFIGURE\n18-39.-Textured\nwall of, and plains materials\nnear, Kant B Crater (AS14-80-10614).\n\nFIGURE\n18-41 .-Complex\nunit (AS14-80-10637).\n\nelongate depression in plains\n\nA hummocky plains-type unit (Cayley Formation) has been mapped within Kant B Crater (ref.\n18-1 ) .

In this\nregion, apparent bedrock can be seen in the floors\nof both fresh and subdued craters.

The value is due to the fact that it\nis high-resolution (approximately 2 m) stereostrip photography (with 60 percent sidelap).\nThe strip covers an area from the eastern rim\nof Theophilus Crater to the Kant Plateau. Materials of Theophilus Crater are well depicted in the\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\n290\n\nphotographs. Details of the rim crest, rock ledges\non the wall terraces, blocky craters on the floor,\ndomical hills of the central peaks, and the ejecta\nblanket of Theophilus B Crater are well displayed.\nThe ejecta blanket of Theophilus Crater may be\ndivided into a hummocky and ridgy unit near the\nrim crest and a smoother facies farther out. The\nKant Plateau materials are represented by plainsforming units with subdued craters and ridges.\nPerhaps the most significant contribution of the\nApollo 14 strip photography is that it provides\n\nnecessary information for detailed crater studies.\nIt provides excellent coverage of Theophilus\nCrater, a 100-km crater. This coverage will allow\ndetailed studies of all units related to that typical,\nlarge crater that is probably of impact origin. In\naddition to this, future analysis of the photographs\nwill provide insight into the nature of smaller\ncraters, mass wasting, and aging. In turn, these\nstudies will provide valuable data pertaining to\nthe nature and thickness of the regolith in this area\nof the Moon.\n\nPART D\nGEOLOGY O THE REGION AROUND THE CANDIDATE DESCARTES\nF\nAPOLLO LANDING ST\nIE\nDaniel J . Milton \'\'\nA geologic sketch map of approximately 10 000\nkm2 surrounding the candidate Apollo 16 landing\nsite in the Descartes region was prepared from\nApollo 14 80-mm Hasselblad (fig. 18-42) and\nLunar Orbiter 4 photography. The area of interest\n(fig. 18-43 ) is located in the highlands southwest\nof Mare Tranquillitatis and is approximately 300\nkm west-northwest of Theophilus Crater. Most of\nthe mapped area is covered by plains-forming\nmaterial and hilly materials of Imbrian age. Circumbasin materials, such as those surrounding the\nOrientale and Imbrium Basins, are not distinguishable from the photographs, although thin deposits\nof ejecta from the Imbrium and Nectaris Basins\nmay be present in the subsurface or perhaps exposed (as shown in the northwest section of the\nmap) in an area associated with Dolland B Crater,\nthe only pre-Imbrian crater (PIC) recognized.\nDolland B Crater and the adjacent lineated terrain\nare cut by Imbrian sculpture and are thus assignable to the earliest period of lunar history. These\nold surfaces are highly modified-it is uncertain\nU.S. Geological Survey.\n\nwhether by superposition of a thin blanket of hilly\nupland material or simply by long, continued, degradation processes. If the age of the old surfaces\nhas been correctly determined, they will be the\nclosest surface exposures of pre-Imbrian materials\nto the candidate Descartes landing site. Dolland\nB Crater is superposed incidentally on what may\nbe the vague rim of a still older crater 150 km in\ndiameter.\nThe hilly units mapped as Ih (formerly referred\nto as materials of the Kant Plateau) and plains\nunit (Ip) of the Cayley Formation form clearly\ndistinct terrains, although some transitional zones\nare present. Division of these two major units,\nboth of which are of regional extent and significance (ref. 18-2) , is more difficult and subjective.\nImbrian sculpture is absent or expressed only as\nvaguely defined lineations; consequently, these\nunits are interpreted to be no older than the\nImbrian age. The moderate crater densities further\nsuggest these units are of Imbrian age but older\nthan the late Imbrian mare of nearby Mare Tranquillitatis (of which the ApoIlo 11 rocks are presumably a representative sample).

Apollo\n14 photography of Zollner DC Crater, east of the\nmapped area, shows a crater in Ip at the base of\na steep slope half buried by Ih material, but it\ncannot be determined with certainty whether the\ncrater was buried during original emplacement of\nunit Ih or by later downslope migration of debris.\n(Zollner DC Crater is described in pt. B of this\nsection.)\nThe clustered hilly unit (Ihc) is characterized\nby a patternless array of steep-sided equidimensional hills 3 or 4 km across. Broader individual\nconvex shieldlike hills are distinguished as the\ndomal hilly unit (Ihd) . The areas of furrowed\nmaterial (Ihf) are characterized by positive relief\nforms of similar areal extent to the clustered hills\nand domes, but with lower relief, flatter tops, and\ngentler slopes, so that they grade texturally into\nbroad rolling surfaces. Negative features, particularly irregular furrows along the crests of many\nof the elongated hills, are more apparent in this\nunit. The subdued unit (Ihs) is similar but has less\nlocal relief and is transitional with the light plains\nunits.\nThe positive features of the hilly units are Ihc\nand Ihd and are regarded as volcanic landforms.\nCraters visible near the summits of a few mounds\nand domes (the northeasternmost dome is a good\nexample) are probably volcanic craters or cal-\n\nGenerally, the plains-forming units are characterized by moderately bright level surfaces marred\nonly by the presence of small craters. Patches with\nanomalously few craters are distinguished as unit\nIps, as are patches with anomalously abundant\ncraters (Ipc) where these craters occur in large\nnumbers. It is not known whether these craters are\nintrinsic to the area or satellitic to distant craters.\nAreas of plains-forming materials that have discernible positive relief features are recognized and\nmapped as unit Ipi. The latter unit may be a thin\ndeposit of plains-forming material incompletely\nmasking hilly material. The plains-forming materials may be lava flows (determined by comparison of the general characteristics to the maria), or\nthey could be fragmental debris that has been\ntransported into topographic lows by mass wasting\nand sustained churning of the surface by impact.\nAlternatively, they could have been extruded from\nmultiple vents within the present plains or could\nbe a very mobile lunar magmatic fractionation\nproduct that originally spread from eruptive centers in the hilly areas.\nMost craters younger than the plains and the\nhilly units are arbitrarily considered Eratosthenian\nin age (Ec) if rays are lacking or Copernican in\nage (Cc) if rays are present. The more irregular\nand grouped craters are probably secondary\ncraters, perhaps from the Cyrillus and Theophilus\nCraters outside the mapped area. Their ages cannot presently be ascertained; accordingly, they are\nindicated by the symbol CEsc.\nStructural grain is not strongly developed in\nthe area. Imbrian sculpture is exhibited in the preImbrian terrain in the northwest and elsewhere\nmay locally have had some influence on the pattern of volcanism in the hilly unit. A poody\nexpressed north-south lineation is also evident,\none example of which is the gentle slope trending\nnorthward between the two bright-rayed craters\nnear the candidate landing site.\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\n\n293\n\nPART E\nSKETCH MAP OF THE CANDIDATE DESCARTES APOLLO LANDING SITE\nCarroll Ann Hodges a\n\nA preliminary geologic map (fig. 18-44) of the\ncandidate ApoIlo 16 landing site near Descartes\nwas prepared from photography (fig. 18-45)\ntaken with the Hasselblad camera, equipped with\na 500-mm focal-length lens, during the Apollo\n14 flight. The area of interest encompassing the\nlanding site includes two prominent bright-rayed\nCopernican craters approximately 1 1 km apart.\nThese two craters are informally called North\nand South Craters. Plains and terrain materials of\nImbrian age and crater materials of Imbrian and\nyounger ages are present within the mapped area.\nPre-Imbrian units occur outside the mapped area\n(outlined on the regional geologic maps in fig.\n18-42, Pt. D ) .\nTerrain materials are mapped according to\ntopographic expression as furrowed (Ihf) , domal\n(Ihd) , and clustered (Ihc) hills units. At the scale\nof the photographs (approximately 1 :40 000)\nused for compilation of the original map, the\ndomical unit is indistinguishable from the hilly\nand furrowed units. This contact, therefore, was\ntaken from the regional geologic map (fig. 18-42).\nThe plains materials represent part of the Cayley Formation (ref. 18-23) and are subdivided\naccording to topographic characteristics more\nreadily observed on the smaller scale photographs.\nThe contacts of the cratered plains unit (Ipc)\nwere also taken from the regional map. With the\nexception of the smooth plains unit (Ips), the\nplains are rather evenly marked by numerous\nshallow depressions resulting in an undulating\nsurface. These depressions, many of which appear\nto be rimless and are shown by short dashed outlines on the map, are probably subdued Imbrianage craters but are older than other more distinctly defined Imbrian-age craters.\nCraters have been assigned to lunar-time stratigraphic systems on the basis of morphology and\na\n\nUS. Geological Survey.\n\nalbedo. Craters with rays are in the Copernican\n(Cc) system; further subdivision by relative age\nwithin this system is made mainly according to\ndegree of ray prominence. Rayless craters are\nclassified as Eratosthenian (Ec) or Imbrian (IC)\ndepending upon the degree of subdual; all craterage determinations are preliminary. The clusters\nof shallow craters mapped as CEsc are probably\nsecondary craters formed by ejecta from Theophilus Crater approximately 300 km eastsoutheast of the mapped area.\nApollo 14 orbital photographs used during\npreparation of the Descartes area map revealed a\nnumber of observations that may be applicable to\nsurface exploration.\nCraters having convex floors seem to be unusually numerous. Most of them are of Eratosthenian age and approximately 1 km in diameter.\nThe two largest Copernican-age craters apparently\ndo not have convex floors. Floor convexity may\nbe the result of local isostatic adjustment (rebound\nover an extended period of time) or of a strength\ndiscontinuity at depth and, thus, locally reflect\ndepth to bedrock. Several craters have ledges in\nthe walls; a near-surface ledge seems to be present\nalong the east rim of a shallow trough trending\nsouth from North Crater. The ledge appears to\nextend into the crater; large boulders on the crater\nfloor further suggest that outcrops may occur in\nthe vicinity of North Crater. A linear ridge extends northward from the ejecta blanket of South\nCrater. Several small, young craters have ledges\nnear the bottom of the walls and may have penetrated bedrock.\nIrregular dark patches are visible, but not\nmapped, in several photographs of plains materials. Dark streaks in the ray materials of North\nand South Craters may have been caused by a\nlocal absence of bright ray material or by the\nejection of dark materials from the crater.

A . Pohn," R. L. Wildey," and T. W . Ofield a\nMicrodensitometry of selected Apollo 8 and 10\nphotography revealed for the first time a brightness\nincrease in the phase-angle region from 1.5 O to 0 O\nof 19 percent on plains materials (ref. 18-24)\nand an increase of 7.2 percent on mare materials\n(ref. 18-25). These observations were not coupled\nvith any explanation at the time of these reports.\nFurther reflection on this problem, visual inspection of selected Apollo 14 photography, and application of current regional geologic knowledge now\nindicate an apparent direct correlation between the\nbrightness surge (heiligenschein effect) and the\nsubresolution roughness of the lunar surface as\nsuggested by empirical experiments (ref. 18-26).\nVariations of the heiligenschein pulse (strength\nof the observable retroflection at or near zero\nphase) as a function of terrestrial terrain and\n"\n\nU S . Geological Survey.\n\nvegetation types have been noted by many individuals and, since 1963, have been discussed intermittently by U.S. Geological Survey Center of\nAstrogeology personnel. The visual observations\nand discussions were the consequence of numerous\nlight plane trips, including astronaut training\nflights, in the vicinity of Flagstaff, Ariz., and over\nvaried desert terrain on flights to Pasadena, Calif.,\nparticularly along airway radial V-I2 from Prescott to Palmdale, Calif. Flight altitudes varied\nfrom approximately 500 m to a maximum of 1500\nm. Although of considerable interest at the time to\nthe Ranger and Surveyor flights, no follow-on\nwork resulted. More recent visual observations\nduring 1970 of heiligenschein variations on terrestrial terrain types from commercial jet aircraft\nbetween Phoenix, Ariz., and Denver, Colo., at\naltitudes in excess of 7500 m indicate an ordering\nof the brightness surge. The surge appears to de-\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\n\ncrease in the following order: coniferous forests,\ndeciduous forests, barren rugged crystalline rocks,\ngrass-covered soil, and, finally, bare soil. These\nobservations for the terrestrial case support a\nprobable strong dependence on the heiligenschein\non the fine-scale roughness of the surface observed.\nApollo 14 photographs were the first to show\nheiligenschein on a variety of lunar-terrain types.\nThe greatest observed heiligenschein surge is in\nphotographs AS14-75-10229 to 10234, in which\nthe zero-phase point is coincident with ray material\nof the Copernican crater near Love and Prager\nCraters on the far side (fig. 18-23). The surge\nprogressively decreases from the rugged upland\nmaterials near Ptolemaeus Crater (photograph\nAS14-75-10259), to the light plains nearby\n(photograph AS14-75-10257), to a low in the\ndark mare materials east of Fra Mauro (photograph AS 14-75-10263).\nBecause the heiligenschein effect is considered\nthe general result of shadowing in diffuse reflection (ref. 18-27), it is reasonable to expect more\n\n297\n\nintergranular shadowing and relatively more retroflection near zero phase as the fine structure of\nany surface becomes rougher.\nThe potential geologic applications of this phenomenon are quite direct. When sufficient zerophase orbital photographs have been accumulated\nand measured, it may be possible to use the magnitude of the heiligenschein pulse as an additional\ndescriptor of geologic units. Investigation has\nalready shown that a measurable correlation may\nexist between measurable photometric properties\nas seen on high-resolution oblique photographs\nand the relative age of small craters (ref. 18-28).\nThe near-zero-phase reflectivity of large craters\nhas long been used as a relative age indicator\n(ref. 18-29). Similarly, the brightness surge of\nterrestrial materials can be determined from aircraft by relatively simple instruments and might\nprove useful as a method of determining fine-scale\nsurface roughness that may be relatable to geologic\nconditions, soil porosity, and moisture content as\nwell as type and condition of local vegetation.\n\nPART G\nNEAR-TERMINATOR PHOTOGRAPHY\nJ . W.Head a and D. D . Lloyd a\n\nFor many years, it has been widely accepted\nthat an examination of the lunar surface under\nnear-terminator lighting conditions (low-Sun elevation) is extremely valuable to geologists and\nother scientists. Before the era when photography\ncould be obtained from spacecraft in lunar orbit,\na large percentage of the telescopic observation of\nthe Moon (both directly and photographically)\nwas conducted when the lunar point of interest\nwas under near-terminator lighting conditions.\nWhen unmanned spacecraft were flown with the\nprime mission objective of lunar photography (e.g.,\nLunar Orbiter), the mission parameters were\nselected to produce photography near the terminaa\n\nBellcomm, Inc.\n\ntor. One reason is that, under near-terminator\nconditions, small changes in slope produce greater\ncontrast changes than at high-Sun-elevation angles.\nA related desirable phenomenon is t%at, at lowSun elevation, the shadow is longer than the object\nis high, thus increasing certain information about\nthe object. For example, at a 20" Sun angle when\nthe exaggeration is 2.75 (cot 20\xc2\xb0), detectability\nand morphologic identiiication are enhanced.\nHistorically, it has been difficult to obtain photography any nearer the terminator than approximately 8 O without severe underexposure. The\nLunar Orbiter and the panoramic camera (planned\nfor the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions) were\noptimized for photography at 20" or above in\nmaria. (In the lunar highlands, the cameras can\n\n298\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCENCE REPORT\n\noperate at lower Sun elevations because of the\nhigher albedo). Neither type camera can produce\nthe desired midrange exposures when operating\nnearer the terminator than 8". However, some\nLunar Orbiter 4 far-side photography was quite\nuseful in certain regions nearer the terminator.\nFaster film could be used to obtain photography\nnearer the terminator than 8 " , but such fast film\ncosts a resolution penalty that, for most unattended\ncamera systems, would be paid for in all the\nphotography obtained during the mission; that\nis, the film selected for photography approximately\n0.5" from the terminator would also have to be\nused for all other photography.\nThe ability of an astronaut to change film in\nthe Hasselblad cameras provided an opportunity\nto use very-high-speed film. Although no imagemotion compensation is normally available for\nthese cameras, it seemed possible to select film\ncapable of photography within 0.5" of the terminator at a resolution that might provide photography of special geological interest. (Imagemotion compensation can be obtained by rotation\nof the spacecraft.) The shadow length of 0.5"\nfrom the terminator would be greater than the\nheight of any object by a factor of 114.6 (cot\n0.5"). Slight variations (less than 0.5") in slopes\nnear the horizontal would produce significant\nvariations in scene contrast.\nTechnical Discussion\nOperation\n\nA sequence of photographs was taken on orbit\n19 of the Apollo 14 mission a few minutes before\ncrossing the sunrise terminator and continued past\nthe terminator. These photographs were taken at\nthe request of the Photographic Team. The location of the area photographed is shown in the\nchart in figure 18-46.\nA Hasselblad data camera with the 80-mm\nlens was used. The timing sequence was set to\nprovide approximately 60 percent forward overlap\nby exposing at 20-sec intervals. The camera was\nset at f/2.8 and the exposure was 1/60 sec. A\nvery-high-speed black-and-white film (Kodak\n2485) was used. The spacecraft was oriented for\nvertical photography.\n\nFIGURE\n18-46.-Photographic\nfootprint of area discussed, showing coverage of Hasselblad photographs\nAS 1 4-78-1 0375 to 1 037 8.\n\nResults\n\nFour photographs (AS14-78-10375 to 10378)\nare of special significance. The field of view of\neach covers an area approximately 2.5" square\n(80 krn east to west by 76 km north to south).\nFigures 18-47 and 18-48 are particularly impressive. The terminator is at the left side of figure\n18-47, which depicts an area to 2.5" east of\nthe terminator. The center of figure 18-48 is at\napproximately latitude 2" N, longitude 32"30" W.\nThe terminator passes approximately midway\nthrough Kunowsky Crater, the southern half of\nwhich appears at the top center. Near-terminator\nphotography (approximately 0.5 " Sun angle)\noccupies the middle third of the figure. The area\ncovered by these two photographs can be viewed\nstereoscopically.\nIf the photographs were to be examined without prior knowledge of the area south of Kunowsky Crater, the lunar surface would probably be\ndescribed as undulating and rough. But human\nperceptual filters must be recognized as controlled\nby recognition models formed by experience that\nhas never included useful photography this close\n\nORBITAL-SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nFIGURE\n18-47.-Near-terminator\nphotograph of area\nsoutheast of Kunowsky Crater (AS14-78-10376).\n\nFIGURE\n1848.-Photograph of area south of Kunowsky\nCrater, bisected by terminator (AS14-78-10377).\n\nto the terminator.

Several types of terrain are observable, including Kunowsky Crater, a hexagonal\nflat-floored crater approximately 20 km in diameter with a characteristic hummocky rim and\ncentral peaks; the hills and domes to the east of\nKunowsky Crater; the flat mare surface that surrounds Kunowsky Crater and the hills and domes;\nand the craters, crater clusters, and rays superposed on the whole area.\nThe geologic relationships of these terrain types\n(ref. 18-30) suggest the following historical sequence of events. The earliest history recorded\nin the surface features was the origin of the multiringed Imbrium Basin and the deposition of a\ncorresponding ejecta blanket known as the Fra\nMauro Formation. This ejecta blanket, probably\ndeposited over the entire area, was characterized\nby a hummocky and hilly texture. Subsequent lava\nflooding during the filling of Oceanus Procellarum\ncovered the low-lying parts of the Fra Mauro\nFormation and isolated the higher portions into\nislands and groups of hills. Either before or during\n\n300\n\nAPOLLO 14 PRELIMINARY SCIENCE REPORT\n\nthe lava flooding of Oceanus Procellarum, Kunowsky Crater was formed. Its age relative to the mare\nis indicated by the incursion of dark mare material\nonto the crater ejecta blanket. After the mare\nflooding, rays and secondary craters from the two\npostmare Kepler and Copernicus Craters were\nformed in the area and produced the northwestsoutheast and northeast-southwest albedo change;\nin the mare.\nOf the terrain just described, the near-terminator\nphotography provides the best results in the nearlevel mare regions, because optimum enhancement\noccurs there. Features of interest fall in three broad\ncategories; detailed studies are being made of each\ngroup of features.\n( 1 ) Mare features.-In\nthe near-terminator\nphotography, extensive flow fronts are visible\nthat are barely (if at all) perceptible on Lunar\nOrbiter photography. In particular, a single flow\nfront has been tentatively mapped for more than\n50 km in the area southwest of Kunowsky Crater.\nMare domes and features emanating from them\nare also evident in these newer photographs. Other\nmare flow fronts, ridges, and structures are also\nenhanced in this photography.\n( 2 ) Craters.-Crater rims are enhanced in the\nnear-terminator photography, and rimless craters\nare particularly evident. A rimless mare crater\nexceeding 1-km diameter approximately 20 km\nsoutheast of Kunowsky Crater is a particularly\ngood example. Secondary crater clusters and\nassociated ray material are also enhanced.\n( 3) Surface 1inearnents.Cubtle surface lineaments are visible on these photographs and are\nbeing mapped and compared to regional structures.\n\nOther features of interest are evident, including\nthe upland terrain and its associated structures\nas well as the deposits of Kunowsky Crater.\n\nConclusions\nFour unusual photographs were obtained that\nshowed lunar-surface areas within 0.5" of the\nterminator and were certainly of significant interest. Many geological features stand out in a\nmanner not usually observed in conventional lunar\nphotography. For a distance of approximately\n0.5" from the terminator, variations in surface\nslopes that are within 0.5" of the horizontal produce significant changes in contrast that enable\nthe brain to perceive these variations. Throughout\nthe area 2.5" east of the terminator shown in\nfigure 18-47, significant geological details are\nevident. Craters and other features produce\nshadows and contrast changes that readily enable\nrecognition, although on first impression, these\nshadows seem to exaggerate the height of the\nfeatures. The flow fronts shown in figures 18-47\nand 18-48 have shadows that are approximately\n100 times their height, thus enhancing detection\nand recognition. The absence of a shadow west of\nthe 1-km rimless crater delimits its rim. Significant contrasts, and even shadows, are produced\nby minor surface lineaments.\nThis special Apollo 14 near-terminator photography was considered experimental. The extent\nto which such photography will be planned for\nfuture miscions and how it will be optimized will\ndepend on further scientific analysis of the-e\nfirst efforts.\n\nPART H\nASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY\nR.
