(1981) have developed a model of the convecting high-latitude ionosphere in order to determine the extent to which various chemical and transport processes affect the ion composition and electron density at F-region altitudes. The numerical model produces time-dependent, three-dimensional ion density distributions for the ions NO(+), O2(+), N2(+), O(+), N(+), and He(+). Recently, the high-latitude ionospheric model has been improved by including thermal conduction and diffusion-thermal heat flow terms. Schunk and Sojka (1982) have studied the ion temperature variations in the daytime high-latitude F-region. In the present study, a time-dependent three-dimensional ion temperature distribution is obtained for the high-latitude ionosphere for an asymmetric convection electric field pattern with enhanced flow in the dusk sector of the polar region. It is shown that such a convection pattern produces a hot spot in the ion temperature distribution which coincides with the location of the strong convection cell.", "title": "Ionospheric hot spot at high latitudes", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T21:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820061319, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Schunk, R.
