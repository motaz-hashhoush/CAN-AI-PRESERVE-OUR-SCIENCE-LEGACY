It is assumed that the flaw may be represented by a part-through crack perpendicular to the plate surface, the net ligaments in the plane of the crack and through-the-thickness narrow strips ahead of the crack ends are fully yielded, and in the yielded sections the material may carry only a constant normal traction with magnitude equal to the yield strength. The problem is solved by neglecting the bending effects and the crack opening stretches at the center and the ends of the crack are obtained. Some applications of the results are indicated by using the concepts of critical crack opening stretch and constant slope plastic instability.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740027195, "id": "4a07df725208498b8f343127b929df52", "publicationDate": "1974-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740027195.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740027195/downloads/19740027195.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740027195/downloads/19740027195.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740027195/downloads/19740027195.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
