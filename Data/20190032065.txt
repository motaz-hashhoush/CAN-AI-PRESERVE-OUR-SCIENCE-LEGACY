b'LEO Commercialization Studies\nDina Contella\nMarch 6, 2019\n\nLEO Commercialization Studies\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n12 companies completed 4-month-long studies on the commercialization\nof LEO and ISS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVariety of independent market consulting firms, transportation and\nhabitat suppliers, and market demand service providers\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStudy objectives included:\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nBusiness plans that explore the viability of commercial destinations\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCommercialization concepts and technical configurations for commercial habitable\nplatforms in LEO (using ISS or free-flying) - \xe2\x80\x9cDestinations\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRole of government and evolution of ISS in the roadmap to commercialization of\nLEO\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDestination\xe2\x80\x9d concepts included:\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nSpent upper stages converted into habitable volumes\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nInflatable modules\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nNew modules, traditionally-built but modernized\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nRe-use of ISS components\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nUse of Gateway program \xe2\x80\x98copi\n2\n\nCompanies that Performed Studies\n\n3\n\nHow do Commercial \xe2\x80\x9cDestinations\xe2\x80\x9d Make Money?\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccommodations\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 sleep stations, toilet, galley, etc. for tourists or\nforeign/US governments\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nResearch & Development \xe2\x80\x93 use of facilities or space and power/utilities for\ncustomer facilities, and possibly commercial crewmember time to conduct\nexperiments\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIn-space manufacturing of unique materials or products \xe2\x80\x93 use of facilities\nor space and power/utilities\n\xef\x82\xa7 Items made in space and then sold on the ground: For example, fiber\noptics\n\xef\x82\xa7 Items made in space for on-orbit use: For example, parts for maintaining\nor assembling spacecraft\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEntertainment \xe2\x80\x93 films, documentaries, sporting events\nSponsorship and Advertising\nTransportation of people and cargo to/from Low Earth Orbit\nLarge Structure and Satellite Assembly\n4\n\nSome Observations from the Studies\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCommercial market predictions vary, making forecast difficult\n\xef\x82\xa7 The markets are emerging \xe2\x80\x93 some might \xe2\x80\x98take off\xe2\x80\x99 and some might fail\n\xef\x82\xa7 Competition for revenue includes terrestrial, parabolic/sub-orbital flights, and other\nspace stations (commercial or non-U.S.)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEarly on, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s use of and payment to destinations will be a key enabler for\nthe emerging commercial market\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nNASA was often considered the \xe2\x80\x9canchor tenant\xe2\x80\x9d of the commercial destinations in the\nstudies\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nStudies generally assumed some number of NASA crew in Low Earth Orbit at all times,\nand NASA would pay \xe2\x80\x98rent\xe2\x80\x99 to a landlord Destination to accommodate them\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nBecause NASA has a need for microgravity research and exploration testing in Low Earth\nOrbit in the future, many studies assumed their destinations housed U.S. government\nresearch\n\n5\n\nSome Observations from the Studies\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHigh crew and cargo transportation costs to/from LEO negatively affect\nboth station costs and commercial market demand\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA reduction in the seat cost to transport tourists to orbit from 10\xe2\x80\x99s of millions of\ndollars down to a few million dollars could significantly increase the number of\npotential tourists that can afford a trip\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTransportation costs make up a very large portion of the cost of a space station\nover time \xe2\x80\x93 on the order of 2/3 of annual costs are spent on crew and cargo\nmissions\n\nThe cost is very high to transport raw materials into space, convert them into\nsomething else (such as fiber optics) and return them to the ground \xe2\x80\x93 so the end\nproduct must sell at a very high price\n\nContinuing ISS use over the next few years supports commercial\nindustry growth\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nBusinesses want to use ISS directly, for example by attaching a commercial module\nto an ISS port, or if free-flying, they prefer to be co-located in orbit near ISS\n\n6\n\n'
