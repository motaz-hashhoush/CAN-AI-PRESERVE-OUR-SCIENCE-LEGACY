Technology gaps and bottlenecks in the end-to-end system, which encompasses acquiring data, processing it, and converting it to useful information, will be identified. Technology development activities addressing these problem areas will be carried out and new technology will be implemented. Phase I, started in 1977, addresses some very near-term data handling and processing problems with the development of some subsystem components. Phase II, with a late 1978 start, will concentrate on complete subsystems developments to effect near real-time data management. Potential future phases are projected to revolve around the themes of low cost data distribution and a full system demonstration.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19790030032, "endDate": "1978-11-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA"}}, "meetingId": "f9ac0d4cdad34307b74838413b6d6c5a", "id": "7dab31097d0043a99852370a82745289"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics"}}, "meetingId": "f9ac0d4cdad34307b74838413b6d6c5a", "id": "b34f46ecf562491cae1dfbdf33c5e458"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "f9ac0d4cdad34307b74838413b6d6c5a", "id": "3f64ef11f39c4462a70e640be647c980"}], "name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and NASA, Conference on ''Smart'' Sensors", "location": "Hampton, VA", "id": "f9ac0d4cdad34307b74838413b6d6c5a", "startDate": "1978-11-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790030032, "id": "a8c3f4e34e494ca9ac1ccfd9f00f06fa", "publicationDate": "1978-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
