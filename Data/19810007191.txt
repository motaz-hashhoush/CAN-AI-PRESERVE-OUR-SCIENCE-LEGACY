For improved reliable operation, the counters are used in an arrangement in which each of the\nmodules effects resetting of the other module on a periodic basis in order to achieve synchronization which\nensures continued counting in the event of failure of one\nof the modules. Resetting is accomplished through AC\ncoupled OR gates 16 and 18 connected to the clear\ninput terminals of the respective counters 10 and 12.\nThese counters have outputs QA, QE, Qcand QD representing numbers in a binary system, or some other system, such as binary coded decimal (BCD) system. Although the counters are shown in an arrangement\nwherein each counts clock pulses, they may also be used\nin an arrangement wherein each synchronously counts\nevents from the same source applied to input terminals\nin which case the input terminals are low except during\nthe occurrence of an event. Otherwise both input terminals are held high at all times to simply count clock\npulses. For counting events, a buffer flip-flop synchronously couples the event signal to the input terminals\nsuch that for each event that occurs the input terminals\nof both counters will be high for only one clock period\nin a manner well known to those skilled in the art. These\nbuffer flip-flops may also be provided as redundant\ncircuits in a manner analagous to the flip-flops of the\ncounters, which will be described with reference to\nFIG. 2.\nEach of the OR gates 16 and 18 is AC coupled to the\noutput terminals QA-QDof its associated counter by an\nRC differentiating circuit, such as the circuit comprised\nof a capacitor 20 and resistor 22 coupling the output\nterminal QDof counter 10 to one of four input terminals\nof the OR gate 16. The output terminals QA-QDof the\ncounters 10 and 12 are coupled to respective output\nterminals A-D through AC coupled diode-OR gates,\nsuch as diode-OR gate comprised of diodes D1 and D2\ncoupled to the QAoutput terminals of the counters 10\nand 12 by capacitors 24 and 26, and a redundant bias\nresistors 28 and 29 connected between output terminal\nA and circuit ground. The coupling capacitors and\nredundant bias resistors of a diode-OR gate form a differentiative circuit with a sufficiently long time constant\nto couple substantially square pulses for the rate of the\nclock pulses or events being counted. Diodes D3 and\nD4 clamp the anodes of the diodes D1 and D2 to circuit\nground to reshape the pulse signals being passed by\nrestoring zero (ground) reference for the pulses passed.\nThis arrangement assumes logic 0 is a low (zero) signal,\nand logic 1 is a high (positive) signal. For the purpose of\nthe following explanation it is assumed that a logic 0 or\nlow level signal applied to the clear input terminals of\ncounters resets all the counter outputs to the 0 or low\nstate regardless of the clock state. Consequently, clear\ninput terminals of both counters are normally held high\nby Vccvoltage applied through resistors 30 and 32.\nThus, with V applied, a low or negative going input is\n,\nrequired to overcome the high on each clear input to\neffect resetting to the zero state. Note that access to the\nclear input terminals can be effected only through capacitors 34 and 36, or through capacitors 38 and 40,and\nthat consequently only a negative going pulse will offset\nin\nthe applied bias (Vcc) a negative direction to reset a\ncounter. Two series capacitors are employed to couple\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n4\n\nthe OR gate of one counter to the clear input of the\nother for greater reliability; a short in one of the two\nseries capacitors will not cause a permanent clear signal\nto be transmitted.\nThe network consisting of resistor 30 and capacitors\n34 and 36 differentiate the output of the OR gate 16 to\nproduce a very narrow negative pulse at the moment all\noutput terminals of the counter 10 go to logic 0 to clear\nthe counter 12. Similarly the resistor 32 and capacitors\n38 and 40 differentiate the output of the OR gate 18 to\nproduce a very narrow negative pulse at the moment all\noutput terminals of the counter 12 go to logic 0 to clear\nthe counter 10. The only time all input terminals to the\nOR gate 16, or the OR gate 18, are simultaneously low\nis when all the outputs of the counter 10, or the counter\n12, are low (logic 0). Thus, as either counter reaches a\nzero state of QA=O, QB=O, Qc=O and QD=O, the\nother counter is cleared, and thereby forced to the same\nstate. In that manner the counters are periodically synchronized. The counter modules operate independently\nat all other times.\nIn the event of total failure of one counter, the other\ncounter will continue to operate normally, even if the\none counter fails in the clear state. Thus, despite one\npoint failure, or total failure, of one module, the entire\nsystem of which the counters are a part will operate\nnormally. For greater reliability, the counters may be\nimplemented with redundant flip-flop modules as will\nbe described with reference to FIG. 2. The clock source\n14 coupled to the counters by isolating resistors 42 and\n44 may also be implemented as a high reliability redundant clock driver as will be described with reference to\nFIG. 3.\nReferring now to FIG. 2, redundant J-K flip-flops 46\nand 48 are shown driven in parallel by the same clock\npulse. Other types of flip-flops, such as the T-type or the\nD-type may use the present invention to equal advantage. The clear input terminal of both flip-flops are\nnormally held high by a voltage Vcc\napplied through\nresistors 50 and 52. Thus, with V applied, a low or\n,\nnegative going input is required to overcome the high\non each clear input to effect resetting to the clear (zero)\nstate. As with the redundant arrangement of the counters (FIG. l), access to the clear input terminals can be\neffected only through capacitors 54 and 56, or through\ncapacitors 58 and 60,and that consequently only a nega,\nV\ntive going pulse can offset the applied bias . Again,\ntwo capacitors in series are employed for greater reliability.\nWhen either flip-flop is set to the zero state, it forces\nthe other flip-flop to the same state by directly clearing\nit. In that manner, this novel interconnection between\nredundant flip-flop modules forces synchronization of\nmodules. In the event of total failure of one flip-flop\nmodule, the other will continue to operate, thus effecting automatic substitution of modules on failure of one.\nThe Q and Q outputs of the flip flops are coupled to\nrespective output terminals 62 and 64 by diode-OR\ngates in the same manner the outputs of redundant\ncounters in FIG. 1 are coupled to common output ter5\nminals. For example diodes D and Dg, and resistors 66\nand 67 form one diode OR gate for the Q output terminals to the redundant flip-flops 4 and 48. Coupling\n6\ncapacitors 68 and 70 function in the flip-flop modules in\nthe same manner as coupling capacitors 24 and 26 in the\ncounter modules (FIG. 1).\nWhen the redundant flip-flops of FIG. 2 are employed in the counters shown in FIG. 1, it is necessary\n\n4,213,064\n\n5\n\n6\n\nfor each flip-flop to also be connected to receive the\nindicated in solid lines in all foiur waveforms.

The combination of claim 15 wherein said one\noutput terminal of each flip-flop AC coupled to all\nothers of said flip-flops is so AC coupled by a plurality\nof capacitors connected in series.\n18. An arrangement of counters, each having a\nunique set of output terminals AC coupled to a set of\ncommon output terminals and all provided with crosscoupled circuits which effect setting of each counter to\na predetermined state by each other counter entering\nsaid predetermined state on a periodic basis so that the\ncounters are periodically resynchronized to insure continuance of sequential counting despite failure of one\ncounter wherein each respective counter has a clear\ninput terminal and a bias resistor that holds the clear\ninput terminal at an inactive logic level, and has a separate detecting gate with input terminals AC coupled to\nthe respective counter output terminals by differentiat-\n\n9\n\n4,2 13,064\n\n10\n\ning circuits to produce a transition from one logic level\ncounters on a periodic basis, and wherein each set of\noutput terminals of said counters is AC coupled to said\nto another logic level at the output of the detecting gate\nwhen the counter enters the predetermined state,\nset of common output terminals by a plurality of AC\nwherein said arrangement further comprises means for\ncoupled diode-OR gates, a separate diode-OR gate for\nAC coupling the output of the detecting gate of each 5 coupling each counter output terminal to the correcounter to the clear input terminal of each other\nsponding one of the set of common output terminals.\n* * * * a\ncounter, thereby to provide synchronization between\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n'
