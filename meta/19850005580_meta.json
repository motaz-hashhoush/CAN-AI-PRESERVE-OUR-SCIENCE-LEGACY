These devices are usually composed of some number of individual cells that are connected together to form a battery. In the cases where these devices cannot be electrically recharged they are usually referred to as primary batteries, whereas if these batteries can be charged and recharged repeatedly, they are called secondary batteries. The past and present uses of primary and secondary batteries in aerospace applications are discussed.", "title": "Electrochemistry and Storage", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T13:32:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850005580, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Thaller, L.
