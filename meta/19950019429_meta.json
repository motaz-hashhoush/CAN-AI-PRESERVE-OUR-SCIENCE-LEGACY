The NASA of the future will fully use the principles of continual improvement in every aspect of its operations. This NASA CI plan defines a systematic approach and a model for continual improvement throughout NASA, stressing systems integration and optimization. It demonstrates NASA's constancy of purpose for improvement - a consistent vision of NASA as a worldwide leader in top-quality science, technology, and management practices. The CI plan provides the rationale, structures, methods, and steps, and it defines NASA's short term (1-year) objectives for improvement. The CI plan presents the deployment strategies necessary for cascading the goals and objectives throughout the agency. It also provides guidance on implementing continual improvement with participation from top leadership and all levels of employees.", "title": "Continual improvement plan", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Technical Memorandum (TM)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950019429, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950019429, "id": "65377b1e87e14556ba4fe767d0d202bd", "publicationDate": "1994-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19950019429.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19950019429/downloads/19950019429.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19950019429/downloads/19950019429.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19950019429/downloads/19950019429.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
