b'Assessment Study of Small Space Debris Removal by Laser Satellites\nSang H. Choi and Richard S. Pappa\nNASA Langley Research Center\nHampton, VA 23681\n\nAbstract\nSpace debris in Earth orbit poses significant\ndanger to satellites, humans in space, and future\nspace exploration activities. In particular, the\nincreasing number of unidentifiable objects,\nsmaller than 10 cm, presents a serious hazard.\nNumerous technologies have been studied for\nremoving unwanted objects in space. Our\napproach uses a short wavelength laser stationed\nin orbit to vaporize these small objects. This paper\ndiscusses the power requirements for space debris\nremoval using lasers. A short wavelength laser\npumped directly or indirectly by solar energy can\nscan, identify, position, and illuminate the target,\nwhich will then be vaporized or slow down the\norbital speed of debris by laser detonation until it\nre-enters the atmosphere. The laser-induced\nplasma plume has a dispersive motion of\napproximately 105 m/sec with a Lambertian\nprofile in the direction of the incoming beam [1-2].\nThe resulting fast ejecting jet plume of vaporized\nmaterial should prevent matter recombination and\ncondensation. If it allows any condensation of\nvaporized material, the size of condensed material\nwill be no more than a nanoscale level [3]. Lasers\nfor this purpose can be indirectly pumped by\npower from an array of solar cells or directly\npumped by the solar spectrum [4]. The energy\nrequired for vaporization and ionization of a 10\ncm cube (~ 2700 gm) of aluminum is 87,160 kJ.\nTo remove this amount of aluminum in 3 minutes\nrequires a continuous laser beam power of at least\n5.38 MW under the consideration of 9% laser\nabsorption by aluminum [5] and 5% laser\npumping efficiency. The power needed for\npumping 5.38 MW laser is approximately 108\nMW, which can be obtained from a large solar\n\narray with 40% efficiency solar cells and a\nminimal area of 450 meters by 450 meters. This\nsolar array would collect approximately 108 MW.\nThe power required for system operation and\nmaneuvering can be obtained by increasing solar\npanel size. This feasibility assessment covers\nroughly the power requirement, laser system, and\na potential operational scenario.\n\nKeywords: space debris, laser vaporization,\npower satellite, laser satellite.\n\nTable of Contents\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nAbstract \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.1\nSpace Debris.......................................... 2\nPower Requirements and Sources....... 3\nLaser Satellites....................................... 5\nCurrent & Future Developments\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6..7\nConclusion...............................................7\nReferences................................................7\nBiographies............................................ ..9\n\n1. Space Debris\nMost man-made space debris larger than 1 cm are\nclosely monitored by space radar and space\ntelescopes. However, objects smaller than 1 cm\ncannot be identified with current technology and\ncan pose a serious hazard to spacecraft, satellites,\nand human flights in near earth orbit. Much of the\ndebris in orbit around the Earth was created in the\npast 50 years. The space debris, scattered over\norbiting the earth, are shown in Figures 1 and 2.\nThe majority of this debris are small particles\nFigure 2. Space debris populations seen\nfrom outside geosynchronous orbit (GEO)\nby NASA. Note the two primary debris\nfields, the ring of objects in GEO, and the\ncloud of objects in low earth orbit (LEO).\n\nFigure 1. Space debris distribution in low\nEarth orbit. Image by NASA Earth\nObservatory.\nnumbering in the tens of millions. This debris\nincludes slag and dust from solid rocket motors,\nsurface degradation products such as paint flakes,\ncoolant released by the Soviet-era Radar Ocean\nReconnaissance SATellite (RORSAT) nuclear\npowered satellites [6], clusters of small needles\nfor creating an artificial ionosphere [7], and\nobjects released by impact of micrometeoroids or\nsmall debris into other objects. Impacts by these\nsmall objects can cause considerable damage to\norbiting spacecraft. The kinetic energy of small\norbiting objects are the major component of\nimpact damage due to high velocities. Upon\nimpact, this debris and the impacted surface\nmaterial vaporize, resulting in plasma ejecting\nfrom the impact crater (see Figure 3).\n\nImpact damage can be mitigated using an\nadditional layer of metal foil on the outside of the\nspacecraft. However, not all parts of a spacecraft\ncan be protected by such shielding. Only when\nthe size of space debris is less than 1 cm can the\nprotective thin-metal film work effectively.\nOtherwise, maneuvering of spacecraft in orbit is\nthe only remaining option to avoid collision [8].\nThis requires accurate position and path\ninformation of the small objects in orbital\nproximity. Currently, radar and space telescopes\ncan track space debris down to about 1 cm (0.4 in)\nin size in low Earth orbit [9], and about 50 cm (20\nin) in size in geosynchronous orbit. However,\nonly about 19,000 objects are tracked out of the\ntotal estimated 600,000 objects [10] larger than\n1 cm. The orbital accumulation of small size\ndebris mainly attributes to the on-orbit satellite\nfragmentations [11]. This leads to a wide range of\nuncertainties on estimating the quantities of debris\nand their predicted orbital paths.\nCollisions with larger debris create numerous\nfragments in the 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) mass range\n[12]. These fragments scatter and become new\nsources of additional collision risks. If the number\nof debris in orbit is large enough, the increased\nfrequency of collisions among scattered debris\n\ncan further generate more debris in orbit. This\ncollision generating debris increases the\nprobability of further collisions that accelerate\nmultiplication of debris in a period of years. This\npossibility is known as the "Kessler Syndrome"\n\nm/s [14]. Repeated laser detonations at the leading\nedge of the debris reduce its orbital velocity and\ncause it to re-enter Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere and\ndisintegrate.\n2. Power Requirements and Sources\nAmong many approaches to remove small space\ndebris, the laser evaporation or laser detonation\n(or ablation) of small objects could be plausible\nsince the laser, optics, monitoring and tracking,\nand steering optics technologies are readily\navailable. However, both approaches require\nsubstantial amounts of laser power. For this study,\nseveral key laser parameters including the beam\npower, mode, wavelength, and optics were\nassessed. The most favorable laser wavelength is\nultra-violet (UV), which is most effective for\nlaser-materials interaction [17].\n\n[14], and there is debate as to whether or not this\ncritical density has already been reached in certain\norbital bands. Although there is no international\ntreaty yet to limit space debris, voluntary\nguidelines have been published by the United\nNations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer\nSpace (COPUOS) [15]. NASA has its own\nprocedures for limiting debris production in space\n[16].\nOne approach to removing small orbital debris is\nusing a space-based continuous wave (CW) laser\nbeam to render it harmless. This method requires\na substantial amount of laser power. Another\napproach uses powerful laser pulses to create a\nseries of plasma plumes from a targeted surface of\ndebris. The incident pulsed laser beam generates a\nsequence of detonation plumes opposite the\ndirection of the debris. The laser detonated plume,\njust like a rocket plume, generates an ejection of\nevaporated plasma with a velocity of roughly 105\n\nAluminum Block\n\n15000\nPower for vaporization, kW\n\nFigure 3. Space debris impact on Space Shuttle\nChallenger\'s front window on STS-7. [13]\n\nPower Required for Laser Vaporization:\nAssuming that most man-made debris from\nrockets, spacecraft, satellites and other sources is\naluminum, several parameters such as the energies\nof vaporization and ionization, laser beam energy,\nlaser-material coupling efficiency, and laser\npumping efficiency need to be taken into account.\nFor aluminum, the vaporization and ionization\nenergies are 294 kJ/mol and 577 kJ/mol,\nrespectively. Assuming an 9% laser-aluminum\ncoupling efficiency [5] at ultra violet spectral\nrange, the power required for vaporization varies\n2700 gm\n1350 gm\n\n12500\n\n675 gm\n\n10000\n\n270 gm\n\n7500\n\n135 gm\n\n5000\n2500\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nTime to Evaporate, sec\n\nFigure 4. Laser power requirement for\nvaporization of aluminum blocks according to\nthe exposure times.\n\nUsing only three minutes of laser exposure to\nvaporize aluminum blocks, the laser power\nrequired linearly increases with the debris mass as\nshown in Figure 5.

Laser power is linearly increased for\nvaporization of aluminum blocks when 3\nminutes of the exposure time is only allowed.\nmust be sufficient to alleviate the poor laser\npumping efficiency (in general, \xce\xb7 < 5 %).\nAssuming a 40% solar cell efficiency [19], the\nsize of an assumed square solar array to generate\nenough laser power to vaporize aluminum blocks\nis plotted in Figure 6. The solar array size was\ndetermined by laser beam power requirements for\nthe three minute vaporization scenario. The\nexposure time of laser beam power is a key factor\nto determine the size of solar cell array. It is clear\nthat shorter exposure times require less power and\nsmaller solar array sizes.\nPower Required for Laser Ablation: The power\nrequired for laser ablation is much less than that\nrequired for complete laser vaporization because\nthe laser ablation process uses multiple laser\npulses to create plasma plumes of laser detonation.\nThe amount of material removed by a single laser\npulse is factored by the material\'s optical\nabsorptivity, laser wavelength, pulse duration, and\npulse energy. The selection of a shorter\nwavelength laser is beneficial for laser-material\ninteraction, but the efficiency of short wavelength\nlasers is lower. The pulse duration can vary over\na wide range from milliseconds to femtoseconds.\n\nVery short laser pulses remove material so\nquickly that small amounts of laser energy is\nabsorbed to heat the surrounding material. Laser\npulse energy is an important factor for the\nablation process. The pulsewidth after the\ncompression of a laser pulse energy determines\nthe power of laser delivered for interaction. When\na laser beam in pulse mode hits the target material,\nit generates a plume of plasma from the material\ncavity because the compressed pulse power is\nhigh enough to melt and vaporize the material.\nAdditional laser pulses hitting the cavity and\nplasma plume continuously increase the plasma\ntemperature through inverse Bremsstrahlung\nabsorption [20]. Of course, when the pulse\ninterval exceeds the recombination time of plasma,\nthere is no inverse Bremsstrahlung process.\nFigure 7 depicts the laser ablation process. When\na laser pulse hits the material, a plasma plume\nfrom the interaction cavity develops and is ejected\nwith a substantial velocity of 105 m/s in vacuum.\n\n500\nSolar Cell Size, m\n\nwith the mass of aluminum and the exposure time\nas illustrated in Figure 4.\n\nSolar cell size for Al\nvaporization within 3 min\n\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nLaser Beam Power, MW\n\nFigure 6. The size of solar cell array was\ndetermined by laser beam power requirement\nfor vaporizing aluminum blocks within 3\nminutes exposure.\nFor a laser pulse of 300 ns and 1 or 2 mm\ndiameter focal spot size for laser-material\ninteraction, the threshold of laser supported\ndetonation for aluminum was measured to be ~ 2\nx 108 W/cm2 [21]. The detonation wave velocity\nvaries from about 104 m/s in air to 105 m/s in\nvacuum. With a CO2 laser that has a wavelength\nof 10.6 \xce\xbcm with 100 J energy and 40 ms\npulsewidth, the ejection velocity of detonation\nwave appears to be approximately 104 m/s [22].\n\nDeceleration by Plasma Plume\nagainst Debris Moving Direction\nfor Geo-Gravity Capture\n\n100000\n\nNumber of Laser Pulses for Full Stop\n\n90000\n\nNumber of Laser Pulse\n\nThe momentum vector of laser detonation works\nagainst the direction of motion as shown in Figure\n7. By repeated laser detonations, the orbital\nvelocity and altitude are changed and the debris\ncan eventually fall into Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere.\nFigure 8 shows the approximate number of pulses\n\n80000\n\nNumber of Laser Pulses to Slow\nDown by 30%\n\n70000\n60000\n50000\n40000\n30000\n20000\n10000\n0\n0\n\nDebris\n\nDebris\xe2\x80\x99 Original\nMoving Direction\n\nPlasma Plume Ejection\n104 ~105 m/sec\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nLaser Pulse Energy, J\n\nFigure 8.

Space debris is ablated after hitting\nby train of laser pulse. The plasma plume (red\narrows) by laser ablation is ejected by\napproximately 105 m/s velocity and decelerates\ndebris for geo-gravity capture.\nrequired for stopping a 2.7 kg aluminum block\norbiting at 10 km/s using laser pulse energy. In\nthis estimate, a UV laser with 488 nm and 1 \xce\xbcs\npulsewidth for an ablation rate of 3 mg per 100 J\nwas used. However, it is not necessary to\ncompletely stop space debris; changing the orbital\nvelocity is sufficient for gradual orbital decay and\nre-entry. Suppose that the orbiting speed of debris\nis reduced by 30% to 7 km/s, which requires.\napproximately 26000 laser pulses. The use of\nhigher pulse energy would require fewer pulses.\nThe ablation spot should not be always the same.\nThe laser pulse may hit the debris off from its\nown center of principal momentum, which will\nmake the target spin. However, the period of\nrotation caused by the off-center impacts is large\ncompared to the repetition rate of laser pulses, that\nthe pulsed laser beam can repeatiously hit the\nsame approximate area. Regardless of where the\nlaser pulses hit the target, the debris will\ncontinuously change its velocity. If the object is\ndecelerated, the debris will continuously decrease\n\nits orbit and eventually reenter Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere.\nBased on this hypothesis, laser ablation is much\nmore favorable than laser vaporization in terms of\nlaser energy requirements and operation.\n3. Laser Satellite\nLaser transmission in space is nearly 100%\nattenuation-free regardless of laser wavelengths.\nHowever, the pumping efficiency of a high power\nUV laser is very low since UV laser pumping\nprocess requires a high level transition from the\nground state to an upper state of population\ninversion. The quantum efficiency of laser\npumping through laser gain medium is limited by\nthe level transition that leads to a down\nconversion process. The largest single transition\nto the first stable state in the level transition\nprocess determines the photon energy of the\nemitted laser beam. The higher the upper level is,\nthe shorter the emission wavelength from\npumping medium can be. Otherwise, by Stark\nsplitting [23], the up-conversion process during\npumping is facilitated for spectral emission.\nTable 1 shows the pumping bands and output\npower of deep and vacuum UV by second\nharmonic generator (SHG). Note that the output\npower of UV pumping by SHG is substantially\nreduced by almost two orders of magnitude. The\n\nUV laser is favorable for removing space debris in\nterms of wavelength, but impractical because of\nTable 1.

Even now fiber lasers\nare known to have very high pumping power\ngreater than 1 kW level. Among them is the\nYtterbium-doped large-core fiber laser that\n\ngenerates 1.36 kW of power at 1.1 \xce\xbcm with 83%\nslope efficiency and near diffraction-limited beam\nquality [24]. A proper optical bundling of this\ntype of fiber laser would provide a high power\noption for laser transmission. Long distance beam\ntransmission from bundled fiber lasers in array is\ndifficult because of the mismatched phases of\nfiber lasers. However, NASA Langley Research\nCenter has developed a method for correcting the\nspatial coherence from bundled laser emissions\n[25]. The dynamic selection of emitting lasers in\nan array may partially correct the spatial\ncoherence of an array of laser beams. The method\ntrades\nfar-field\nintensity\nfor\nsimplistic\nimplementation and array lifetime extension,\nresulting in a quasi-coherent array with features of\nadaptive optics. Accordingly, because of pseudo\ncoherence achieved by the dynamic selection\nmethod [25], the beams from 45% of lasers in\narray can be collectively concentrated onto a\nreceiver at a farther distance away with far-field\nintensity.\nFar-field transmission using bundled lasers such\nas diode or fiber is feasible but requires at least\npseudo-coherence of the beam.\nUnder this\nassumption of pseudo-coherence of bundled lasers,\nseveral scenarios of beam power transmission\ntechnology in space have been developed at\n\nFigure 9. Power satellite and ground power station are used for wireless power transmission\nby either laser or microwave.\n\nNASA Langley [4, 25-28]. Recently, an Nd:YAG\nlaser doped with chromium was directly pumped\nwith solar energy [29]. Although the total\nefficiency of a Nd:YAG solar pumped laser is still\nlow, the directly solar pumped laser is attractive\nbecause solar energy is abundant and free.\nFigure 9 shows several scenarios of wireless\npower transmission for space applications. The\nkey challenge for removing debris using the\nproposed approach is how to provide sufficient\nelectrical power to a laser system in space. The\nleft-hand side of Figure 9 shows a power satellite\nfor deep space using a radioactive thermoelectric\ngenerator (RTG). However, solar energy is\nplentiful near earth and can be harnessed for\nuseful applications. For a large power lasers, the\nsize and cost of the required solar arrays are key\nconcerns. The size of the required solar arrays for\nthis application was plotted at Figure 6.\n4. Current & Future Developments\nUnfortunately, there are no practical activities for\nspace debris mitigation and removal to date. Only\nthe working group meetings for reviewing the\nseriousness of space debris have been held\nnumerous times. The most recent one was the\nmeeting organized by the International Science\nand Technology Center (ISTC) to stress the\nimportance of the continuation of the research in\nthe field of space debris removal in the lower\nearth orbit taking into account various elements\nsuch as the risk of collision and self-decaying of\nthe various objects and to conclude that\ninternational cooperation and partnership is\nessential [30]. The seriousness of man-made\nspace debris has been well addressed but still\nactual actions for removal of space debris are\ndesperately required while constraining any\nfurther increase of debris. The DARPA\xe2\x80\x99s\nCatcher\xe2\x80\x99s Mitt report [31] addresses the overall\nconcerns and solutions related to ever increasing\nspace debris.\n\nlaser vaporization and laser ablation. The power\nrequired for either case can be obtained from solar\nenergy. This study found that the laser ablation\napproach uses less energy than the laser\nvaporization approach and is therefore preferred.\nThe reduced energy consumption using laser\nablation results from the lower laser pulse energy\nrequired for slowing the orbiting velocity of\nunwanted debris.\nReferences\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[7]\n\n5.
