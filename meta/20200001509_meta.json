Recently, researchers have proposed using discrete lattice building blocks and co-designed robots to build high-performance, scalable primary structure for various on-orbit and surface applications. These robots would locomote on the lattice and work in teams to build and reconfigure building-blocks into functional structure. However, the most reliable and efficient robotic system architecture, characterized by the number of different robotic 'species' and the allocation of functionality between species, is an open question. To address this problem, we decompose the robotic building-block assembly task into functional primitives and, in simulation, study the performance of the the variety of possible resulting architectures. For a set consisting of five process types (move self, move block, move friend, align bock, fasten block), we describe a method of feature space exploration and ranking based on energy and reliability cost functions. The solution space is enumerated, filtered for unique solutions, and evaluated against energy and reliability cost functions for various simulated build sizes. We find that a 2 species system, dividing the five mentioned process types between one unit cell transport robot and one fastening robot, results in the lowest energy cost system, at some cost to reliability. This system enables fastening functionality to occupy the build front while reducing the need for that functional mass to travel back and forth from a feed station. Because the details of a robot design affect the weighting and final allocation of functionality, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of changing mass allocations on architecture performance. Future systems with additional functionalities such as repair, inspection, and others may use this process to analyze and determine alternative robot architectures.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20200001509, "endDate": "2020-03-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "98150949e95c44cfb1f3eaaa18892570", "id": "869796fad74e41e8b4a9bcae485d332c"}], "name": "IEEE Aerospace Conference", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "98150949e95c44cfb1f3eaaa18892570", "startDate": "2020-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20200001509, "id": "ff23e6b813704cea9e5139229e297116", "publicationDate": "2020-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20200001509.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20200001509/downloads/20200001509.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20200001509/downloads/20200001509.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20200001509/downloads/20200001509.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
