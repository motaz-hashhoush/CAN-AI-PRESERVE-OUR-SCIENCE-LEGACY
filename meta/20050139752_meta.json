ST-5 will consist of a constellation of three 25kg microsatellites. The mission goals are to demonstrate the research-quality science capability of the ST-5 spacecraft; to operate the three spacecraft as a constellation; and to design, develop and flight-validate three capable microsatellites with new technologies. ST-5 will be launched by a Pegasus XL into an elliptical polar (sun-synchronous) orbit. The three-month flight demonstration phase, beginning in March 2006, will validate the ability to perform science measurements, as well as the technologies and constellation operations. ST-5's technologies and concepts will enable future microsatellite science missions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20050139752, "endDate": "2005-04-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "GOMAC Tech 2005", "location": "Las Vegas, NV", "id": "a3af17bb425244bca065e7cb6cdab5f4", "startDate": "2005-04-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050139752, "id": "683bbc2ef1cc4bc9921a2f5b0efaecc4", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050139752.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050139752/downloads/20050139752.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050139752/downloads/20050139752.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050139752/downloads/20050139752.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
