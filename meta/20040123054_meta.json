Two experiments examined the role of workload (number of aeroplanes that participants directed), delay (between receipt of prospective instructions and execution), and phonological rehearsal. High workload increased prospective memory errors but increasing delay from 1-3 or 5 minutes had no effect. Shadowing aurally presented text reduced prospective memory performance, presumably because it prevented verbal rehearsal of the prospective instructions. However, performance on the foreground task of directing aeroplanes to routine destinations was affected only by workload and not by opportunity for rehearsal. Our results suggest that ability to maintain performance on a routine foreground task while performing a secondary task--perhaps analogous to conversation--does not predict ability to retrieve a prospective intention to deviate from the routine.", "title": "Prospective memory in dynamic environments: effects of load, delay, and phonological rehearsal", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-22T01:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20040123054, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stone, M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field CA United States"}}, "id": "e237d9f8275641da86b02bef1d413788"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20040123054, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dismukes, K."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "67a03bfc7d4d43e8bdf7ac92f137f686"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20040123054, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Remington, R."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "9c7e95b8ea3e4a6b819a4ada585d35be"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20040123054, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1080/09658210143000100", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "9", "submissionId": 20040123054, "issue": "3", "issn": "0965-8211", "id": "f5a53357b2984ae7aff80eab4a81e7b7", "publicationName": "Memory (Hove, England)", "publicationDate": "2001-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
