Cosmonaut Lebedev kept a diary, from which\nexcerpts of his notes were published in the Moscow edition of\nPravda. These excerpts provide revealing insights into the\npsychological conditions of cosmonauts in the current stage of\nspace fJight. It appears that with increasing amounts of time\nspent in orbit, the initial euphoria subsides, while the desire\nto return home increases simultaneously. In the press,\nespecially in the USA, the morale report has gained attention, and\nhas added to the awareness that the laws of technology alone do\nnot determine the layout of spacecraft; rather, the human psyche\nmust be taken into consideration if mankind is to feel at home in\nspace.\n\nThe first phase of the manned space station is to consist of\nlaboratory and workstation operations, which the crew will\n\n- 2 -\n\ni\n\n41\n\n6\n\noperate for a half-a-year, after which they would be relieved by\na new crew of specialists. Similar to work on oil rigs, arctic\nobservation stations, and other short-term posts on earth, the \t\n\na\n\ncrew would be expected to live with uncomfortable and spartan \t\n\nt\n\nconditions. Living conditions play only a subordinate role under\nsuch conditions. The individual must accept the short-term\nstressfull health conditions, and is subject to temporary psychic \t\n\ni\n\nstress due to poor living conditions. Although there will be\nattempts to make the living conditions as pleasant as possible,\nthe relaxation periods restfull, and to increase the value of the\nexperience of living in an altered environment, nonetheless the\npsychological and environmental aspects will play a central role\nonly in the later, second phase, which will be concerned with\nthe conditions of actually living in space.\n\nTechnology is increasingly determining environmental conditions\neven here on Earth, even if many natural conditions still have an\neffect also. However, with the help of cutting-edge\ntechnological know-how, space experts are constructing an entirely\nartificial world in the middle of the cold, airless desert of\n\t\n\n,i\nj\t\n\nspace. They are being confronted with difficult, and sometimes \t\nt\n\nunfamiliar conditions. They are as yet unable to use practical\nexperience and proven methods to overcome the most frequently\noccurring phenomena, such as the lack of gravity, reduced air\n\na\ncirculation and the stress on the sensory organs, such as\n\n- 3 -\n\nm\t\n\nP\n\nA\n\nthrough excessive noise. Their task is to utilize the newest\ndiscoveries and test them experimentally. In fulfilling this\ntask, psychological and space environmental aspects can not\neasily be separated from one another. When mankind expresses\nitself by constructing a building, the building is an external\nreflection of the human psyche. In turn, this then has a reverse\neffect on mankind, influencing especially his outlook on life.\nThis means that all available kinds of technology and\nthe arts must be utilized. A long-term process of increasing\nawareness and empirical examination will be necessary to determine\nthe final design, fulfilling not only the technological\npurpose, but also taking into consideration the human psyche, and\nthus providing suitable conditions for the new tasks demanded of\nhumanity.\n\nIf this problem is compared to the development of the automobile,\nthe current space stations would resemble the early models of\nGottfried Daimler from the year 1886, while we are facing a\nfuture project for the 21st century that goes beyond the concepts\nof today\'s technology to overcome the known difficulties, and\neffortlessly fulfills all imaginable requirements. If the\ndevelopment of the automobile required one hundred years, we are\nhoping to utilize our expanded knowledge and computer expertise\nto formulate a strategy to redu;:e this period of development to\njust a few years. I would like to elaborate on some of the\n\n- 4 -\n\nW\n\nwell-known applications as follows.\n\nIn the media, the external shape, or the entire concept of the\nspacecraft, plays the dominant role. At first, it becomes apparent\nthat the designs of the Americans are markedly different from those\nof the Soviets. NASA has selected a building-block system, which\ncan be limitlessly expanded: and enlarged. However, the Soviet space\nplanning authorities are following a different principle. They\n\n4\n\nalready have space stations of the Salyut series, which may be\naltered by docking connections along the axial plane. This extremely\nsimple system is both the current design as well as a design\n\nfor the\n\nfuture, which would encompass much larger dimensions. These\ndesigns represent the basic concepts\n\nof their respective economies\n\nand technologies; here, both are very open and variable, while\nthere they are closed, centrally controlled systems with\npre-determined boundaries. One can assume that the future trends\nwill come closer to each other.\n\nObservers here on Earth would first be impressed by the exterior\nshape, which is only natural, as they are the ones who would be\npaying for it, and they will have to be enticed to fund the\noperation using their fantasy through advertisement; the\nastronaut, howr-ver, will only rarely have a chance to see the\nentire station. For him, the inner structure, the divisions\n\n- 5 -\n\n..J\n\ni\n\nA\nR\n\namong the various sections and the connecting passageways will be\nof greater importance. T1,ey represent the streets and plazas of\na city out of history, where humans met and worked with one \t\n\na\n\nanother without other means of transportation. A logical and\ncarefully planned arrangement should ensure that the main living\narea is of a suitable nature. In no case should the final result\nbe merely a result of technical necessity. We can assume that\ndesigns significantly different from what we might have expected\nwill be the result. The social and esthetic concepts of human \t\n\nt\nr\n\nlife up until now have been directly influenced by gravity. There\nwas an up and a down; standing upright was a part of human\ndignity. The lack of gravity in near-Earth orbit, which is in\nactuality a state of permanent free-fall, does not result in any\nsuch type of orientation system. Even the time references are\nlacking, such as day and night and the seasons. Other common\nreferences, such as light and shade or head. and cold are only\nexperienced in excess, and can only be used in filtered form, and\nmay be totally replaced by technological means.\n\nThe current models are merely Earth structures placed into zero\ngravity; the American models are the same size as the dimensions\nof the Space Shuttle cargo bay, then built up either vertically or\nhorizontally. The Soviet Salyut spacecraft, which may be more\nindependent in its dimensions, is also designed with gravity in\nmind. However, it is usual to forego long-term planning, and\n\n- 6 -\n\nsimply design\n\na short-term auxiliary structure,\n\nsuch as the\n\nretractable landing gear of a modern airplane. It is possible\nand logical\n\nto\n\ndesign a station in a circular shape, with usable\n\nsurface all around, as one does not need a surface to walk on; this\nwould result in an area without hard-to-reach places, such as the\nceiling of a room. The passageways should be similar, where one\nwould not have to move in a two-dimensional direction, but rather\nwhere three-dimensional planning would be required. It would be\nnecessary to replace the gravitational orientation system with\nanother similar orientation system,. which would provide a\nrefers:nce point for the entire structure.\n\nUp until now, the sleeping quarters in spacecraft consisted of a\nkind of sleeping bag which was placed along a wall. In manned\nspace stations, it is clearly evident from the required standards\npreviously mentioned that each astronaut will have to have his own\nprivate area provided for him; it will have to be arranged according to\npsychological criteria\xe2\x80\x9e Living quarters will be characterized\nby warner colors and more natural surfaces than the working\nareas, which will be lighter and brighter. The special attraction\nof this type of living will achieve a new level of interior\narchitecture, similar to the interior architecture of ships,\nwhich strongly influenced interior arrangement on land.\nTechnology will play a dominant role in all areas, and will\npresent itself in many new ways. It will have to be presented\n\n- 7 -\n\nV\n\nas more lively and .friendlier,\n\nif it is to reflect the current:\n\nrequirements.\n\nNow we turn once again to the psychological aspects, as shown in\nthe diary of Cosmonaut Lebedev. The impact of heritage, family\nand life up until now plays an increasing role. Wife and child,\nyouth and childhood, parents and homeland, all these appear in a\nnew light, and have to be assimilated. The apparent difficulties\nexperienced by the highly emotional Soviets were only suppressed by\ntheir heroic idealism, and not overcome. However, extensive\npsychological training allows the required emotional level to be\nattained, which increases the ability to experience everything\nr\n\nnew. This then prepares them for acceptance of new developments,\nand especially helps them to avoid homesickness. One can internalize\npsychological feelings so mach, that the majority of them need not\nbe carried along into space in order to maintain the integrity of\nthe soul, overcome the fear of being left behind, and thus be\nprepared to experience the naw situation.\n\nIn the course of the coming optimization process, models will\n;s\n\nhave to be developed and tested. Space environmental designs of\nI\n\nall types, incorporating light, ventilation and daylight orientation,\nl\t\n\njust to name a few examples, will be developed, as well as models\nof psychological development, which in the most optimistic case will\n\n- 8 -\n\n.... r.\n\n^\t\n\nIre rB.r.,r\n\nA\n\n\'4B\t\n\nlead to a new level of awareness of the modern, "zero gravity"\nman. This will then be of real value for mankind, and is more\nimportant than all other technological and economic advantages.\n\nI\n^F\nrot\nE\n\nY\nF\n\n*Graduate Engineer E.
