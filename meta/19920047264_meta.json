Essentially, the NGS provides the communications links by which the MCS performs its various network control and monitoring functions. The NGS also provides telecommunications links capable of transmission/reception of up to approximately 70 Mbit/s of digital telephonic traffic. Operating as a system, the entire complex of equipment is referred to as the NGS/MCS. This paper provides an 'as-built' description of the NGS/MCS as a system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19920047264, "endDate": "1992-03-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "AIAA International Communication Satellite Systems Conference and Exhibit", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "78ba687858d64ebd897b9d1cbce4228e", "startDate": "1992-03-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920047264, "id": "ae3893b20a454175b30f83536de682d2", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
