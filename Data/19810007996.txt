Also, this report is intended to serve as a\'`\nguide to the geologic characteristics to which advanced coal\nextraction technology would be applicable.\nSection I identifies the major generic difficulties in doing\nlon g -term forecasting, drawing especially on the results of the 1979\nJet P r opulsion Laboratory (JPL) Conference on Coal Models and Their\nUse i.n Government Planning (Reference 8). The present research effort\nreflects an attempt to mitigate the impact of such conferenceidentified forecasting difficulties on the derivation of the target\nprises and market for an advanced coal extraction rtystem. JPL\nreviewed the existing coal models to determine whether these models\nprovided the information necessary to construct Puch estimates. It\nquickl y became apparent that none of the existing coal forecasting\nmodels generated sufficiently precise and comprehensive estimates of\nthe resource base, mining and transportation costs, and coal demand on\na regional basis. Since it was determined that such ostimates were an\nabsolute necessity as input in the present project, JPL contracted\nwith Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. (EEA) to develop a set of\nthe basic data/estimates that could then be utilized to derive the\nrequisite regional price targets. The results of the EEA effort and\nJPL\'s modification and use of the data are the major subjects of this\nreport.\nSection Il outlines the methodology used to estimate the\nLocation and magnitude of coal, reserves in the year 2000, and the most\nsalient geologic characteristics of this reserve base. To this end\n"Inferred" reserves were estimated and added to more traditional\nestimates of "measured" and "indicated" quantities distributed among\n15 supply regions. The results of this procedure are contained in\n\n*Used here, conservation refers town attempt not to damage coal\nreserves proximal to mine areas, they may be cost-effective for\nmining at some future date beyond the target year 2000.\n\nTable 2-3 (page 2-8). Of the 859.0 billion tons or total reserve*\nesti mated:, over 78 paroent (666.7 \'billion tons) are estimated to be\ntiridorgroUnd reserves. Of these underground reserves, over 30 percent\n`UO.2 billion tons) are ostimated to be In the San Juan Region with\nan equal amount in tta regions which collectively comprise Appalachia.\nNext, in order to describe these reserves with a level or detail\nthat would facilitate their linkage to a specific mining mothod, each\nregion\'s total reserves were subdivided into "reserve blocks" of\nspecific tonnage, sulfur oontentp and major geologic parameter\nvalues. The result Is an initial base reserve estimate broken into a\ntotal of 1.164 "reserve blocks" and characterized as one of 180 "mine\ntypes." The form of these initial estimates is t1lustratal in Table\n2-4. This result is in turn restructured by keying on underground\nmine reserve blooks and the three geologic parameters chosen as having\nthe largest potential impact on the now technology (seam thickneas,\nblock size, and overburden depth). This allows the number of mine\ntypes to be aggregated from the original 180 to a more matiaseable 16.\nTable 2-7 (page 2-14) contains a summary of these key mine-type codes\nwhich are used In the final regional price target forecasts, while\nTable 2-8 (page 2-15) presents the division of the estimated regional\nunderground reserves (in tervis or a maximum yearly recovery rate)\namong these constructed mine types.\nTab,e 2-8 shows that the ll yyy ll mine type contains almost 60\npercent of the estimated underground reserves. A ll yyy" reserve/mine\n1\nea\nhas seams greate p than 42 inch\xe2\x80\x94 - tthiak, a block .size of greater than\n20 million tons, and lies under morel than 500 feet of overburden. No\nother mine-type Is estimated to contain more than 18 percent of\nestimated undergro=d reserves. Further, if the 1\xe2\x96\xbayyl 11 type reserves\n(reserves with thick seam, large block size and less than 500 feet of\noverburden) are added to the "yyy t\' type, a full 75 percent of the\nreserves are estimated to lie in these thick seam, large block size\nmines.\nSection III addresses the set of methodologies used to estimate\nthe costs of traditionally mining these 1164 reserve blocks in 1985\nand 2000 in the form of a Minimum Acceptable Supply Price (MASP). The\nMASP concept (of an average supply price per time peviod) is detailed\nand the major assumptions involved identified and eitaluated. Again,\nunderground mines are the focus. Emphasis is pla--ed on identification\nand explication of the necessary assumptions involved in constructing\nthe required mine cost models. Ideally, the JPL moving baseline model\nand data would have been available for inclusion by EEA in the work\ndescribed in this section (EEA t Final Report, March 7 2 1980). However,\ngiven the fact that the moving baseline was still being developed at\nthat time, EEA\'s assumptions of fixed productivity increases over the\nperiod from 1980 to 2000 may be viewed as proxies for the more\ndetailed output of the moving baseline.\nSection IV describes the derivation of the demand estimates, by\nregion and coal type, together with the forecast transportation costs\nbetween supply and demand regions. The rosults of these estimates are\n\na set of forecast regional production and market price (MASP) levels\nby coal and mine type for the years 1965 and 2000. The latter half of\nSootion IV contains the breakdown and discussion of this forecast data\ncaveats\naccording to the 16 underground mina types, and \t\n\nregarding the appropriate use of these data in the 4PI, project, The\nmajor results of this section fall i nto the followi n, two oateprica\nand are located in the Tables referenced below:\n(1)\n\nCoal demand estimates;\n\n(a)\t\n(b).\t\n(2)\n\nComparative total (Table 4"3, page 14 - 4) .\nBy sector ("Fable 4-\xc2\xbb2, page q-4).\n\nForecasts using these data:\n(a)\n\nRegional production, surface and underground (Table\n4}-5, p age 4-9) .\n\n(b)\n\nRegional and sulfur category MASPs (Table 4 - 6, page\n\n4-10.\n(o) Regional production (2000) by mine: type (Table 4-7\npage 4 - 13) .\n(d)\t\n\nRemaining rnn i.onal reserves (2000) by mine type or\n\nsulfur category (Tahl.e. `4-8, page 4- 14).\nThe demand estimates, when oo,\'npared to the aggregate forecasts\nof other mayor models, appear reasohable in the sense that there are\nalternative estimates which lie above and below those, given here (for\n1965)\xe2\x80\xa2 Likewise, When the estimates utilized in the present :study are\nbroken down into their seotoral components and compared with those\ngenerated by Data Resources, Inc. (ART), the same conclusions can be\ndrawn. As we note, how;ver, significant increases in the demand for\ncoal over the next 20 years is a possibility with potentially far\nreaching (positive) ramifioations for the commercial attractiveness\nand appropriate development characteristics for an advanced coal\nextraction system.\nThe forecast production levels contained in Table 4-5 (page 4 -9)\nare of significant importance. First, while total underground\nproduction is forecast to be essentially the same in 1985 as it was in\n1976, it is forecast to increase dramatically (by almost 160 pevoent)\nby 2000. This foreshadows the potential for a large new market for an\n\nadvanced underground mining technology. It is important to note that\nthe largest projected increases in underground production are in\nCentral Appalachia and the Uinta Basin.\nThe forecast marginal MASPs for these production levels and\nregions are presented in Table 4- 6 (page 4-11) and indicate that those\nof the underground mines in Appalachia :and the Uinta Basin are\nexpected to be $25-30 Per ton in 1985 and $26 - 32 per ton in 2000, and\n\n4\ncve..c.ieaLw+. ar.xratyr.+n^au^aeamcvx..\n\ns\n\nstill be competitive in some market* with $7-8 per tore (mine-mouth)\nsurface coal from the Montana/North Dakota and Powder River Basin\nregions. Theo* prices are consistent with the National. Coal Model\nestimates ($23-30 in 1985 depending on supply demand/aoena,rio), ar*\nlower than the ICS\'/CE"M estimate* for Central Appalachia for 1990\n($25-38) and 1555 03:\'-42), and are in the same general range (to those\npredicted by Bechtel\'* RRSPONS model. (The above estimates and their\nmodels are discussed .further in EEA\'o ,Status Report, Reforonoo 10\nTables 11-7 and 11-8 present the breakdown of forooaot regional\nproduction and remaining reserves by mine type. The primary interest\nis in thick seam, large block size mines. It should be noted that 2:14\nmillion tons per year are forecast to be mined from Uinta region with\noverburden of more than $00 eeet (this will be 70 percent of\nproduction from all ouch mines), On the other hand ^nly 0.2 million\ntons are forecast to be extracted from Central, Appalachian mines with\nthe sa ge characteristics (note that 80 milii.on tons are forecast for\nall thick seam, large block size: mines regardless of the overburden in\nCentral Appalachia). The characteristics of remaining reserves in\n2000 presented in Tnble 4-8 provide additional data relevant to tfae\nchoice of target markets and technical features desirable} in an\nadvanced coal extraction system. The final section of Part IV\ncontains suggestions of the most appropriate ways this data may be\n\nused.\nFinally, Section V summarizes the qualifications associated with\nconcerning its future modifications\n\nthe data And makes recommendations\nand refinements.\n\nrs_4\n\nSECTION I\nINTRODUCTION AND STUDY OBJECTIVES\nThis report present* the initial attempt at deriving a Bob of\nregional coal price eatimiteo based on forecasts of supply and demand\nconditions for the target time frames 1985 and 2000. Those forecasts\nwill in large part determine the degree to which a newly developed\nadvanced coal extraction system will be commercially attractive, i,e.,\nouch a system must be profitable enough to induce people to buy it.\nTherefore, it is n r uoial that such a aystem be no more costly per\nextracted ton than those systems with which it can be expected to\ncompete in the 1985 and aOOO target time frames.\nIn addition, it has been determined that the system to be\ndeveloped must demonstrate a measurable improvement in the safety of\nthe miners using it, with no unfavorable impacts on minter health,\noonservat\'.1n, ot , environmental factor*, This simultaneous consideration of the profitability, miner health aAd safety, conservation, and\n\nenvironmental impact performance goals largely explains the need for\nsuch an effort outside the coal industry itself. While one might\nsuppose that basic economic incentives would drive the industry\nmembers to see their own self-interest in tho development of as more\nproductive and cost-effective method of extraction, it is unlikely\nthat the remaining performance goals would tinter thel-r research and\ndevelopment process except as regulatory constraints.\n\nA.\t\n\nSTUDY APPROACH\nSince the "commercial attractiveness" goal for the advanced\n\nunderground system requires knowledge and comparison of the regional\n"target lr prices, JPL reviewed the existing coal models to determine\nwhether these models provided the information necessary to construct\nsuch estimates. It quickly became apparent; that none of the existing\ncoat; forecasting models generated sufficiently precise and comprehensive estimates of the resource base, mining and transportation costs,\nand coal demand on a regional. basis. Since it was determined that\nsuch p atimates were an absolute necessity as input in the present\nproject, J\'PL contracted With Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc.,\nto develop a set of the basic data/estimates which could then be\nutilized to derive the requisite regional price targets. The results\n\nof the EEA effort and JW s modification and use of EEA\'s data are the\nmajor subjects of this report.\nIn the process of constructing a model to forecast such regional\ncoal price targets, the ideal methodology would be to first define the\n"market environment" in which the innovation to be developed would\nhave to exist. This would involve the estimation of the demand\nconditions expected to prevail for the y coal.- This information, along\nwith data on the conventional supply of chat., would ;Meld an estimate\n\n1-1\n\nof the derived demand for the technology necessary to produce the\ncoal. Of course, the conventional supply is derived from the existing\ntechnology, or production processes, the geological conditions in the\nvarious coal reserve blocks, and the prices of the inputs required.\nBased on the forecasts of price and quantity, an assessment could be\nmade of the profitability, and henoe, commercial appeal of the new\ntechnology.\nThus, the objective of this study was to assist in the estimation\nof relative profitability of a new extraction technology in various\nsupply regions and under various geologically-defined mining\nconditions, and thus to provide an estimate of the ,potential marketability of advanced extraction systems in various target markets.\nTherefore, the real attempt was to provide estimates that will\nfacilitate the development of a marketability projection as a function\nof a number of cost and geologic characteristics rather than as a\nsingle, unique guideline or number.\n\nB.\t\n\nFORECASTING DIFFICULTIES\n\nThe actual forecasting task, however, is certainly not as\nstraightforward as it might seem, even with the foregoing qualifications. The major source of this difficulty is the long-term nature\nof the forecasts involved. As part of a JPL effort to determine\neffective forecast methodology a c nfer-ence was held in July 1979 too\n,\nassess the difficulties in the use of long-term forecasts in the\nenergy area. 1 The discussions from the conference are being\ndocumented into a statement of the strengths and weaknesses of current\nenergy forecasting efforts (Reference 8). These assessments became\nmajor considerations in the development of the methodology to derive\nthe regional target prices required as guidance for the advanced coal\nextraction project\'s production cost targets.\nWhile it is beyond the scope of the present work to detail the\nresults of the conference, it is both important and useful to the\nsubstance of the remainder of this study report to provide a brief\nsummary of the +3onference consensus. Therefore, the following text\ncontains a list and brief discussion of the major concerns identified\nby the participating panel.\n\n1.\t\n\nUncertainty and Stochastic Elements\n\nCertainly, the major problem with forecast credibility is the\nLength of time into the future for which a model attempts to forecast.\nWhile there is much concern over the credibility of predictions as\nmuch as 20 years into the future, it was argued that the unacceptable\nalternative is sheer subjective speculation. A forecast based on a\nmodel provides a methodology to establish reasonable ranges for the\ncrucial variables while the alternative provides no explicit framework\nto generate such statements.\n\n1-2\n\ni\n\n\t\n\n2.\t\n\nProcess versus -Econometric Model\'s\n\nArgument over developing process versus eoonom,--x tr10 models IK^\ndirectly rol \xe2\x96\xbated to the concern with "capturing" b4ljaVioral ohangi^\n\nover time, Specifically, there has beep an increasing tendency to use\n\nprooeme models, those which describe t60brologioal relationships to\nthe exclusion of behavioral, and hanoe o major economi c variables.\n\'\nHowever, it can be argued that the exclusive use of pvooeoo model\n\nmethodolog y almost completely discounts the possibility that the\n,expectations of the human participants can affect the process being\n\nmodeled. (For example, thero is no way for the National Coal Model to\nendogenounl y control the impact of expectations among its three major\ntime periods, 1985, 1990, and 1995.) The panel suggested fiat a\nh y brid approach ) I.e., rgarrying the two, might be more sati4factory.\nPartial versus General Equilibrium\nAll of the coal and energy models in current use are only\n\npartial equilibrium models, i.e., they have exogenously generated\nvalun incor porated with no "feedback" to the sectors whose operation\ne\nresulted in the given values. This, of course, can result In\nsi.gniVicant distortions and variations from reality in the model\'s\npredictions. (For example, at present the Mid-Term Energy Forecasting\nSystem is not able to consider the changos one might expect in the\norionn and output of industries which depend heavily on energy as an\ninput, .)\n\nThe Appropriate Level of Disaggregation\nRelatively accurate forecasts of highly aggregated variables may\nbe as ivsAlsis to a speciric problem as those that are disaggregated to\nthe point that their necuraov Is largely suspect. Ideally, the level\nof model structure detail (for example, the number of supply and\ndemand regions %ased) would be based on an explicit oost-benefit\ndnaistnn. Most times such a decision in based on data availability\n\na\n,, nd the strength of deadline or cost constraints.\n5.\t\n\nData Limitations\n\nThe quantity and quality of data available have proven to be\nsignificnnt constraints in the long-term energy forecasting area.\nEfforts should be made to identify situations In which the use of the\nexisting data will result in biased forecasts and to consider the\npossibility that a more appropriate data base should be developed.\nLack of Model Assessment\nIn the final analysis, there is no consensus regarding the most\nappropriate way to measure the extent to which as model is "good" or\n"bad.," or the benefits accruing from its use. This places an\nis\njI\t\n\n1-3\n\na,\ni\n\ninordinately high premium on the "art" of the assessor. To the extent\npossible, the reason for the forecast should be investigated to glean\' 1\nthe foundation for all measurable goals. The potential contribution\nof the model\'s forecasts to these goals should then be assessed. \t\n;!\t\n!\nFinally, care must be taken not to expect too much from the models\nthemselves. That is, the forecast values should be viewed as inputs\nto a decision process. It should be recognized that they are\nprobability statements and as such are not for use as unique and\ndeterministic point estimates of the future.\n`j\n\nf\n\ni\nSECTION II\nTHE RESOURCE BASE\n\nThe first phase of the JPL effort to define and characterize the\nresource base upon which to base the Advanced Coal Extraction Systems\n(ACES) project cost and market guidance involved the estim4ti.on by\nEnergy and \'Environmental. Analysis, Inc. MA) of the regional deposits\nof coal reserves which could be mined using present technology. The\nmajor objectives of this portion of the EEA effort were: (1) to\ninclude all the known ooal which would be available to mine in the\nYear 2000 and be y ond; and (2) to ensure that these reserves were\ndescribed at a level of detail which would allow evaluation of the\nty pe of mining technology.\nThis effort was necessitated by the fact that none of the coal\nreserve J escri.ptions incorporated in other coal models satisfied both\nthe conAtions necessary to construct an acourate cost and market\ng uidance for the ACES effort. Specifically, conventional reserve\ndescriptions fail to;\n(1)\n\nInclude total coal, reserves. The Bureau of Mines estimates\ninclude only "measured" and :"indicated" reserves which\nunderstate the true quantities of coal in the ground.\n\n(2)\n\nDescribe the reserves in sufficient detail. For example,\nareas generally omitted include seam thickness, slope,\npitch, and other salient characteristics that in large\npart determine the most appropriate mining technique, and\nits cost.\n\nThus EEA\'s reserve characterization effort was composed of the\nfollowing steps, subsequently discussed in turn\n(l)\t\n(2)\t\n\nEstimation of total region-specific "recoverable reserves."\n\n(3)\n\nSubdivision of each region\'s total reserves into "reserve\nblocks" of specific tonnage, Btu and sulfur content, and\ngeologic parameter groupings.\n\n(4)\n\nA.\t\n\nDivision of the country into 15 supply regions.\n\nAssignment to each such reserve block the most probable\n(present technology) mining method.\n\nTHE SUPPLY REGIONS\n\nThe 15 supply regions chosen were determined to be those areas\nthat include all. the important bituminous, subbi.tumi.nous, and lignite\ndeposits in the contiguous United States, and in which coal rank,\ngeology, and quality are roughly homogeneous. The geographical\n\n2-i\n\n`J\n\ncomposition of these :supply regions is contained in Table 2-1. For\neach region the average rank, Btu content, and distribution of\nreserves over three categories of sulfur content were estimated.\'\nThe three ranges of percentages in Table 2-1 correspond to the\n"compliance," "low," and "high" sulfur categories generally used to\ndefine coal. demand.\nB.\n\nREGION- SPECIFIC RECOVERABLE RESERVES\n\nBeginning with basic information in the U.S. Geological Survey\n(USES) reports and the available summary reports on the geology and\noccurrence\nof coal documented by numerous other sources (F!NA, Final Report,\nSection 6-7), EEA expanded on the coal resources described in such\nconventional data bases by including the results of recent exploration\nactivities, reserves usually not included due to ownership problems,\nand by extrapolating the location of "Inferred" reserves. Thia.,s, the\nEEA-estimated reserve base contains "measured," "indicated," and\n"inferred" reserves 8 in an attempt to more accurately represent the\nsize and location of the potential, market for advanced underground\nextraction sy stems. Since approximately 61 percent of U.S. anal\nreserves are classified as "inferred," and since the construction of\nprice tar g ets involves forecasting supply patterns in the year 2000,\nit was deemed appropriate to include these inferred resources which\nwill likel y have become "measured" by that time.\nHowever reasonable such assumptions of inferred coal resources\nma y appear, it is still possible they may be incorrect. For example,\nduring the JPL Goal Conference a major new research effort was reported\nupon, the objective of which was to provide more accurate estimates of\nregional coal reserves because of the present degree of unreliability\n(Reference 8). And even this significant effort left at least one\npanal member skeptical. \t His assessment was that the Illinois\nGeological Survey, which has collected data on over 600,000 boreholes\nover a 50 year period, has yet to accurately forecast depositional\npatterns in reserves. Thus, recalling the caveats in Section I\nregarding the sources of uncertainty, que"i.ty of data, and the need\nfor model assessment, JPL plans to monitor the sensitivity of the\nstud y-developed price targets to the exclusion of inferred reserves\nfrom the resource base, where. feasible.\n\nC.\n\nDEFINITION OF .RESERVE BLOCKS\n\nEEA chose the following sets of geological characteristics as\nthose which would capture the most important factors affecting the\ncost and type of\'mining in the reserve block:\n\nORIGINAL \'AGE IS\n\nOF PCOR\n2-2\n\n;t\ni\n\nTable 2-1.

Surface mineable\nreserves are further identified as those best suited for "contour" and\n"area" stripping; underground mineable reserves are associated with\neither "room and pillar" continuous mining or "longwall" technology.\nTable 2-2 summarizes all the possible combinations and presents the\nvalues the geologic parameters may take.\n3\n\nSurface mines are characterized by thickness, slope, pitch,\nstripping, ratio, and block size. Surface contour mining is used for\n\nmedium and steep slopes where the coal outcrops. These conditions are\nfound nearly exclusively in Appalachia. Only one block size is\nconsidered for contour mines; this is because economies of scale are\nassumed not to be relevant to contour stripping, given that the actual\nequipment and pit layout can occupy only a small area az a time. Arpw,\nstripping is used for gentle slopes where seams are continuous over\nbroad areas. Unlike contour mines, western area mines include thick\n(over 119 inches) and pitching seams. Area mines are characterized by\nlarge mining blocks and are capable of producing as much as 6.75\nmillion tons or more per year.\nUnderground mines are characterized by seam thickness, pitch,\n\nblock size, overburden and whether the mining block is drift or shaft\nmineable. Room and pillar mines are assigned to most flat and.\nmoderately pitching seams with 2000 feet or Less of overburden. Seams\nthat are steeply pitching or under deep overburden (over 2000 feet) are\nconsidered best mined by the longwall method. Mines in Appalachia may\nbe restricted to small areas of reserves, such as a drift operation,\nthat mines a reserve part way up a narrow ridge. Therefore, small and\nmedium reserve blocks are assigned to drift mines and large blocks to\nshaft mines.\nD.\t\n\nASSIGNMENT OF RESERVES TO MINE TYPES\nIn the final stage of EEA\'s analysis effort, the total reserves\n\npreviously estimated for each region were assigned to one of the 180\n}\n\ne\n\neffective mine types as described by the various possible combinations\nof seven of the nine variables ,\'Listed in Table 2-2.\t This is accomplished\nin a sequence of 11 steps which are briefly described in the following\ntext.5\n\ni\n\n4\n\nS\n\nf\nf\na\nr\n\nTable 2-2.

The\n\ndistributionof "average slope" was estimated in order to\nbe able to reflect the increased costs associated with\nsurface mining on steep slopes.

Geologic\niewed and\nreports (county-level whenever possible) were rev\nooal-bearing areas distributed into the three categories,\nwith reserves treated as evenly distributed across the\ncoal bearing area in the same proportion as the areas.\nHowever, this is a regional pitch estimate and for most\nUnited States reserves regional pitch is negligible\n(usually less than 10 degrees). Locally, pitch may vary\ndramatically, but as yet it is not possible to reasonably\nestimate its distribution.\n\n(6)\n\nDivide the Surface Reserves into Strip Ratio Categories.\nThe portion of the surface reserves (Step 1) in the\nstandardized 20:1 category was divided into 10:1 and 20:1\ngroups to more closely reflect the actual distribution.\n\n(7)\n\nDistribute the Underground Reserves into Thickness of\nOverburden Caegori.es.

In Appalachia, reserve blocks are limited in\nsize by topographical and geological constraints which\naffect the continuity and/or extent of the mineable\nportion of the seam.

Thus a single ridge may contain 20 million\ntons of coal but have Individual mines limited to 6\nmillion tons each. This is generally not true for\nnon-Appalachian underground reserves.

This then\n\t\ndivided such tt\nyields a total of eight possible aggregated "mine types" identified by\nthe values of the tri p let (a2, a4, a5).\nThe "pitch" and ,"entry , " variables have been suppressed in order\nto focus on a manageable number of variables. With respect to entry,\nIt was determined that the need for shaft rather than drift access\nimpacted more on development cost than on the method of extraction\n(and hence operating cost) once the seam was reached. Since costs\ndivorced from extraction mode are of less direct interest in terms of\nthe technology development, it was deemed a reasonable abstraction.\nThs suppression of pitch might seem somewhat more worrisome. As noted\nabove, EEA was only able to use re g ional pitch in their reserve base\nestimations. While they recognized that there is significantly more\nvariation in local pitch, the input data did not allow its\nestimation. As a result, in the 15 regional underground reserve base\nestimates, only regions 7 1 12, and 14 contain aM\'pitching reserves\n(i.e., over 10 degrees). Table 2-6 summarizes these data. Thus,\ngiven the extreme;\\,y small percentage of total estimated regional\nreserves that could be ^nlassifi.ed as having any significant pitch, it\nwas determined the ,study would focus on flat-lying seams.\n\nh\t\n\nTreatment of the dichotomization of the values of the remaining\nthree geologic variables is perhaps less obvious. First, seam thickness\n(a2) was considered. It was decided to divine all reserves into\nthose with (relatively) "thin" , seams, less than 46 inches in the EEA\ndata base, and those with (relatively) "thick" seams, greater than\n46 inches. These decisions correspond to a 2 = 1 In the former case,\nand a2 = y ( y = 2, 3) in the latter case. Likewise, it was decided\nto focus on "small" ( 5 million tons) and "Large" ( >_ 20 million tons)\nblock size reserves. This corresponds to all \t 1, and all \t y (Y\':2)\nin the EEA data base. And finally, it was decided to oall mines with\n0-500 feet of overburden O\'shallow," and those with over 500 feet,\n"deep" mines. These correspond to a5 = 1, and a5 = y (y ? 2)\n\nrespectively.\nThus eight possible "mine types" have been defined by all\npossible combinations of the newly aggregative values of the triplet\n(a2, all , a ). The values of this triplet are then used to\ndesignate the mine types, which are summarized in Table 2-7.\n\n-\t\n2-13\n\n1\ni\n\nTable 2-6.\t\n\nPitching\nCoal\n\nTotal\nReserves {U)*\n\nPitching\nCoal (U)*\n\nSulfur\nType,\n\ng\nRegi.\'an\n\nEstimates of Pitching Coal.\n(underground)\n\nHigh\nLow\n\n15.2\n24.6\n\n75.5\n\n53%\n\n12\n\nCompliance\nLow\n\n57.7\n76.9\n\n134.6\n\n38%\n\n111\n\nCompliance\nLow\n\n5.7\n26.7\n\n1334.8\n\n2%\n\n206.8\n\n28,410\n\n1%\n\n7\n\nTotal\n(1.-15)\n\n*Million metric tons per year.\n\nTable 2-7.\t\n\nParameter\nValues\n\nCharaoteristios\nSeam, inches\n(a2)\nThickness, inches\n\n<42\n\nr.\t\n\n111\t\n\nlyl\t\n\nlly\t\n\n?C\t\n\nX\t\n\nX\t\n\n6\n\nx\t\n\n\'20\n0-500\n\nOverburden, feet\n(a5)\nDepth, feet\n\nx\t\nx\t\n\nX\t\n\nv\n\nx\t\n\nyyy\n\nx\n\nX\t\n\nx\n\nX\n\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\t\n\nx\t\n\nyly\t\n\nx\n\nx\t\n\n> 500\n\nyyl\n\nx\nx\t\n\n2-14\n\nI1\t\n\nMine Type\nlyy\t\ny11\t\n\n\': 42\n\nBlock, million\nmetric tons\n(a4)\nSize, million\nmetric tons\np\n\nDefinition of Mine Type& by Characteristics\n\nX\nx\t\n\nx\n\nTable 2-8.

Likewise, the latter four have a2 = y,\nand are therefore "thick(er)" seam mines. Reading down any column\nidentifies the spec{,fic characteristics of that mine type.\nFinally, Table 2-8 presents the estimation of the (yearly rate\nof production) reserve data contained in Table 2-5 broken down by\nstudy-revised mine type characteristics. Given the largo quantity of\nestimated reserves relative to the present yearly rate of use, these\nvalues and their relative size mean little by themselves. However, as\nwill be discussed in Section IV, such a breakdown will be valuable in\nconstru6ting advanced coal extraction system price targets.\n\n2-16\n\nf\n\nSECTION II I\nESTIMATION OF MINING COSTS\n\nThe modeling problem next addressed was the estimation of the\ncost of actually bringing coal, to the mouth of a mine. This estimation\nprocess is addressed in some detail below. It will also be most\nuseful to discuss the particular "supply cost" concept utilized by\nEEA, and this discussion will be carried out in the remainder of this\nreport.\n\nA.\t\n\nTHE MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE SUPPLY PRICE (MASP)\n\nThe methodology for attempting to estimate a probable future\nmarket price for a commodity incorporated estimating basic cost of\nproduction for various levels of output and then determining how much\nof this supply will be forthcoming at various market prices, as well\nas determining from which firms this supply will likely come. Thus,\nany particular firm would likely vary its desired level of supply\ndepending upon the prevailing demand (or market) price. Hence, when\nthe estimated level of demand (which also is a function of the market\nprice) is combined with the aggregate supply plans of the industry and\nan equilibrating market price determined, only then is the particular\nlevel of production of a firm (and its prevailing sup p ly costs) known.\n\nIn the ease of the coal industry, the unique production and\nmarket conditions, which will be discussed in more detail below, call\nfor a somewhat different task. In particular, instead of deriving a\nsupply curve for a particular coal mine in a region (similar to that\nof Figure 3-1), the mine/reserve block-specific supply curves will be\nderived as shown in Figure 3-2.\nThe supply curve in Figure 3-1 indicates that as the selling\npH= A of the product increases, a "traditional" firm is willing to\n^suriply an increasing quantity of its product. This stems from its\n(generally) increasing periodic costs of production and its desire to\nmaximize its profits. In Figure 3-2, the MASP curve indicates that\nthe mine owners have calculated their Minimum Acceptable Supply Price\nto be p dollars per ton and are willing to supply as quantity of coal\nbetween zero and a tons at that average revenue or price per unit\nduring the production year. That is, they are interestod in recovering\ntheir total actual costs, amortized over the expected lifetime\nproduction of the mine, plus a "reasonable" return on their investment\ncapital.\nx,.\n\nGiven the special nature of the market for coal this is a\ndefensible assumption. Specifically, the tremendous reliance on longterm contracts between a specific buyer and specific producer (mine)\nmakes a predetermined period over which the reserve block is to be\n"mined-out" a realistic assumption. Likewise, these long-term\ncontractual relationships make true market influenced ;price\n\n3-1\n\nTONS\n\n.xvtliv i i i r aurrLlW tSY 1-1KM i\n\n%\n\nIN EACH PERIOD\n\nFigure 3-1.

The JPL\n"moving baseline" alternative cost guidance will provide\nfor the estimation of potential dynamic\nmore distant future.\n\n(2)\n\nchanges in the\n\nProduction Costs: No real change in capital and operating\n\nthrough 1955 is expected.

Its operation consists of three interrelated steps\n(1)\n\nFor a given mine t ype and base production size, inputs\ncovering capital and operating costs are fed into the\n\nmodel. Other cost elements (e.g., depreciation) are\ncaleula"ed internally, some being\nproductivity determination made\n(2)\n\ndependent upon the\n\nin step (2) below.\n\nThe mine\'s production level, and costs are adjusted to\nreflect the miners\' estimated productivity (in uneleaned\n\ntons/day). The productivity estimates depend\nsize, geologic characteristics, and region.\n(3)\n\nupon mine\n\nThe amount of annual revenue required to amortize all\ncosts is calculated. This magnitude is then divided by\nclean tonnage to complete the estimation of the MASP for\nthat particular mine type and reserve block.\n\nThe major factor in determining the MASP of any particular mine\ntype relative to another is the productivity estimate resulting from\nstep (2). This is because mine costs, with the exception of some\noperating and labor costs, are fixed for a given mine, base size, and\n\ntype. The productivity estimate is critical because it determines the\ntotal estimated coal production, and \xc2\xb0thus the number of tons of coal,\nover which coal costs can be spread. The prominent role of\nproductivity warrants a deeper look at its determinants.\n\nf@\ny\n\n3-4\nj\n\nD.\t\n\nESTIMATING MINER PRODUCTIVITY\n\nThe productivity estimates were developed through a four stop\nprocess:\n(1)\n\nCalculation of a base productivity, individually, for\nlongwall,, Appalachian room and pillar, and other room and\npillar mines\n\n(2)\n\nAdjustment of the base estimate reflecting geological\nfactors.\n\n(3)\n\nA further adjustment to reflect raw or uncleaned production*\n\n(4)\n\nA final adjustment to reflect expected gains in\nproductivity through 2000.\n\nIn the process of developing this four-stop estimation procedure,\na number of assumptions naturally had to be made. Most involved\nrelatively minor corrections to theproductivity data used in the\ncalculations and taken for the most part from Mine Safety and Health\nAdministration statistics covering 1600 underground mines from the\nfirst quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979\xe2\x80\xa2 However, two of\nthese assumptions are of such potential importance to the accuracy of\nthe relative and absolute value of the forecast MASPs that further\ndiscussion is warranted;\nAssumption 1. Smaller mines are more productive than larger ones\n(i.e., there exist diseconomies of Seale), at least in Appal.aoh a.\nAssumption 2. The 1977-1979 increase in underground miner\nproductivity will continue such that a trend is established. On this\nbasis the associated productivi.ti,es in the model were increased 5\npercent for 1985, and 20 percent for 2000. No such assumption and\nadjustment is made with respect to surface miner productivity.\n\nESA\'s model structure Assumption 1, that small Appalachian\nunderground mines are more productive than large ones, was based upon\nthe perception of greater management efficiency and work force\nexperience and cohesion in the former which leads in part, to fewer\nwork stoppages and thus more production pe r employed worker .10\nAlthough this assumption would seem to be valid if one could expect\nthat the same number of work stoppages in the same mines continue and\nthat the same size work force would be kept on the .payroll, this does\nnot seem likely to occur. In fact such work stoppages have declined\n(EEA Briefin g , p g. 35) and are expected to continue to fall..\nAlthough to determine in any rigorous way the effects on forecast\nMASPs of this assumption the model will have to be rerun without it,\nthe following statements can be made prior to this effort;\n(1)\t\n\nAssumption 1 biases the cost of production of smaller mines\nin regions 1-4 downward relative to that region\'s larger\nmines. Thus the region-specific MASPs could be expected to\nrise if it is relaxed.\n3-s\n\n\t\n\n(2) In addition, because of the interconnected nature of the\nmarket determinants of the structure of 1 985 and 2000\nregional MASPs and production levels, it could be expected\nthat predicted Appalachian production levels would tend to\nbe biased upward relative to competing regions.\nAssumption 2, underground labor productivity increasing 5\nperooht by 1985 and 20 percent by 2000, is based on an interpretation\nof the data illustrated in Figure 3 -3. The assumption is that the\ndeclining productivity for the period 1968-1977 is outweighted by the\n\n1977-1979 data showing an overall increase in productivity of 25\npercent and individual Increases as indicated in Table 8- 1. Although\nthis assumption too seems questionable, a more rigorous attempt can be\nmade to estimate its impact on the predicted MASPs (because of the\nmanner in which this productivity assumption enters the MASP\ncalculation).\nThe MASP calculation can be broken into two terms l li a\nconstant and a term which is inversely related to at, the assumed\nproductivity change:\n\nM\nMASP\t\n\n+a + M2\n1\n\nIf there is no productivity improvement in 1985 (2000), then the first\nterm will be 55 percent (20 percent) larger in 1985 (2000). Hence, the\nquantitative effect of the productivity assumption depends upon the\nrelative size of MI and M2. M1 is is estimated to be approximately\nthree times as large as M 2 . 1 2 The precise relationship of Ml to\nM 2 will vary depending upon characteristics such as mine size, seam\nthickness, and mine type. This procedure may be utilized to calculate\nthe correct M l to M 2 ratio for any combination of mine characteristics.\nUtilizing the estimation of a 3 to 1 ratio for M l to M 21 the\nestimated impact on MASP of the productivity assumption can be derived.\nWithout the assumption of a 5 percent productivity increase in 1985\nand a 20 percent increase in 2000, the affected MASPs would be 3.8\npercent higher in 1985 and 15 percent higher in 2000. Thus the\nprediction of underground (versus surface) production may be biased\nupward by unduly reducing the relative price of underground coal. To\nthe extent further work indicates a necessity to be more specific, the\n\nmodel may be rerun, incorporating a modification to this productivity\nassumption.\n\nE.\t\n\nMINE COST ADJUSTMENTS\n\nThe final output of the mine cost models is a single MASP for\neach coal reserve block. However, it is clear that the actual cost of\nmining any given reserve block can vary significantly and thus it was\ndetermined that an additional adjustment was warranted. The causes of\nthese variations include:\n\nf.\t\n\n7\n\n3-6\ny\n\n^^\n\nTONS PER MINER - DAYS\nX10\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\nSURFACE MINES\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\nUNDERGROUND MINES\n\n1968\t\n\n1969\t\n\n1970 1971\t\n\n1972\t\n\n1973\t\n\n1974\t\n\n1975\t\n\n1976\t\n\nCOAL MINE HEALTH AND SAFETY ACT_\nNEW UMW CONTRACT\nSOURCE; USBM MINERALS YEARBOOK\n\nFigure 3--3.

It would be ideal if the market price for an ACES\nproject could be determined. But since ACES technology is undefined,\nthe supply side of the model is entirely missing. Thus the focus of\nthis report is on the demand for ACES. In particular, it would be\nuseful to determine the amount that coal producers would be willing to\npay to obtain ACES.\n\nfollm .\n\nIn the subsequent text, the total and regional demand for coal\nin the target ye%A& is first estimated and its variability evaluated.\nNext, the estimation process and results of the transportation cost\nforecasts between the supply and demand regions are delineated. The\noptimization model that actually yields the forecasts of market prices\nin the target years is then described and its results presented.\nFinally, the most appropriate use of the forecast price and production\ndata is investigated to derive an initial set of price targets.\n\nA.\t\n\nTHE DEMAND ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY\n\nThis section describes and evaluates the methodology used by EEA\nto estimate the regional demand for coal necessary to determine the\n1985 and 2000 forecasts of market coal prices and production levels.\nSpecifically, EEA\'s plan of attack was to:\n(1)\n\nDivide the county into 15 demand. regions.\n\n(2)\n\nEstimate the associated regional demands for coal in the\ntarget years by major demand sector.\n\n(3)\n\nCalculate the total demand for sulfur category coal which\nmust be supplied (from the previously identified supply\nregions).\n\nThe demand regions used by EEA are set forth in Table 4-1 (along\nwith the numerically corresponding supply regions for comparison).\nThese are of particular importance because of the associated accuracy\n\n4-1\ny\n\n-\t\n__.....\t\n\n-.r=.

In the former\nonsep since transportation costs from the supply region to each of the\nstates within the area will be roughly the same, those states can be\ngrouped together without risking any reduction in model accuracy. In\nthe latter case however, more care must be given to grouping of the\nstates. When there are "competing" supply regions, transportation\ncosts (see subsequent text) become a critical factor.\nNext, CFA estimated the regional demands from the major demand\nseotovs: utilities, industrial boilers, motallurgionio synthetic\nfuels ) and export. The BRA model utilizes a given demand soonapill\nand emphasizes the two coal markets, electric utility and industrial\ncoal, which accounted for 83 percent of coal demand in 1978. The\n\nelectric utility projection relies on two assumptions:\n(1)\t\n\nFor the short term (198S) t utility coal demand is\naccurately estimated by relying primarily on the\nutilities\' own projections or coal.\n\n(8)\t\n\nFor the year 2000, all electricity not generated by\nnuclear power will be coal generated.\n\nESA\'s Industrial Fuel Choice Analysis Model (XFCAM) was used to\ndevelop the industrial demand projection. SCAM forecasts are based\non assumptions of industrial growth rates, talc energy and\nenvironmental regulations, and relative fuel prices.\n\nBecause there\n\nis\n\nuncertainty concerning the elasticity of supply\nand demand ) some sensitivity analysis in imperative. The fact that\nthe BEA model utilizes exogenously determined demands for coal makes\nof\nscenarios which are likely to\nit easier to do sensitivity analyses\nshift the demand for coal.\nAn attempt can be made to place the BEA estimates in perspective\nby comparing them, where possible, with those made by other groups and\nstudies. This is done in Tables 4-2 and 4-3. Perhaps the most striking\nfeature of these tables is the narrow band into which the estimates\nfall. It may be of comfort to realize that the BEA forecast lies near\nthe middle of the range of forecasts. But it must also be recognized\nthat these foreoaats all fail or succeed together; no one forecast lies\nso far away from the others as to have different predictive content.\nThe reason for the narrow band could either be attributed to the\npowerful foreoasting techniques available to the modern analyst or to\nthe risk averse nature of the forecaster.\n\n4-3\n\nI\ni\na\n\nTable 4-2.

Such an assumption in the derivation of\nequilibrium may be warranted under any of the following three\nconditions:\n(1)\n\nThe price implicitly assumed in the demand scenario\nhappens to equal the equilibrium price.\n\n(2)\n\nDemand is perfectly inelastic.\n\n(3)\n\nSupply is perfectly elastic.\n\nWhile the First condition is outside the bounds of reasonable\nprobability, a case could be made for the last two. If coal is\nsignificantly \'lass expensive than other alternative fuels, demand\ncould show strong inelasticity over a range. Because of the tremendous\nsuppl y of coal reserve, it might be argued that the supply curve could\nexhibit high elasticity.\n\nThe JPL study proposes that, for the purposes of determining\n\nan\n\nadvanced system\'s cost guidance and target markets, an effective\nstrategy would be to make some relatively simple assumptions of\npercentage shifts and totals in regional.. production. Specifically;\n(1)\n\nWhen the search for the target region(s) and mine type(s)\nhas narrowed to to small number of candidates, then look at\nchanges\nthe sensitivity of the choice of each to posited:\nin demand (production) from that region and mine type.\n\n(2)\n\nRerun the EEA model, with a revised sequence of sectional\nand regional demand growth rates and check to see if there\nis a change in the optimal choices.\n\nA more complex and potentially critical portion of the EEA\ndemand projection methodology occurs where demand is di,saggregated to\n\nthe regional level.. Any error in the allocation of the overall demand\nfor coal has the potential, to tremendously bias the pi^ture in which\nsupply regions and mine types should be the "target market" for the\nnew teohnol.ogy. Unfortunately, it is a .relatively complex task to do\nthis type of sensitivity analysis.\nB.\t\nE\t\n\n\'\t\n\nTRANSPOPTATION COST ESTIMATION\n\nThe product of the transport cost estimation step of the EEA\nforecast process is a matrix of minimum estimated cost-per-ton\ntransportation costs between the supply and demand regions. EEA used\n1979 rate structures for the set of competing modes of transportation;\nrail, barge, slurry pipeline, and appropriate combinations thereof,\nand oal.cul.ated the actual costs from sample shipping points to sample\nreceiving points. This approach avoided many of the pitfalls inherent\nin use of the older, alternative "centf aid" approach.\n\n4..5\n}\n\nMore specifically, the major components of the EEA rate\nestimation methodology were:\n(1)\t\n\nBaseline rate determination;\n(a)\n\nFor existing rail and barge movements, actual July\n1979 rates were used.\n\n(b)\n\nFor currently non-existent rail and barge movements,\nrates were estimated from comparable existing\nmovements.\n\n(c)\n\nSlurry pipeline rates estimated from 1979\npro,jectiAns.\n\n(2)\t\n\nRates were calculated or reduced in real terms to .reflect\nconstant dollars.\n\n(3)\t\n\nWhere multiple transportation options were available, the\nLeast expensive link was selected.\n\nFinally, the specific major assumptions made in estimating the\n1985 and 2000 transportation rates are:\n\n( )\t\n\near\n\t In the we s ter n wn a tGd^ Ao ..h.. rwt..s are not expected to\nWW9 p_ o a\nws auci n \to\nA.\nincrease over the next 20 years, as the recently established\nwestern rates account for future conditions, including:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nLarge volumes of coal needed to be shipped per year.\n\n(e)\t\n\nDistances to eastern markets.\n\n(d)\t\n(2)\t\n\nRelatively new equipment and track and anticipated\nadditional investment.\n\nCompetitive position with eastern coal.\n\nIn the eastern United States the rates are projected to\nincrease 18 percent in real terms by 1985 and then remain\nconstant through 2000. This assumption reflects:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nContacts with TCC and recent TCC decisions.\n\n(o)\t\n(3)\t\n\nMajor investments in eastern railroads will need to\nbe made in new equipment and renovation.\n\nDOE projections.\n\nBarge rates are assumed to increase 18 percent in real\nterms by 1985, reflecting the federal fuel tax and an\neffort to take advantage of eastern rail rate increases,\nand then to remain constant through 2000.\ns\n\ni\n\n4-b\n\n(1I)\t\n\nSlurry pipelines will not be operational, until 1985.\nPipeline rates will decline in real terms relative to rail\nand barge rates between 1965 and 2000 because \'their large\nfixed cost limits inflationary impacts.\n\nStudy concern with ERA\'s assumptions and their impact on\ntransportation rates is derived from the latter\'s reliance on the\nregional coal supply estimates to fill the exogenously given demands.\nTo visualize the potentialfor changes in the predicted regional\nproduction levels one must consider the way in which Table 4-4 shows\nthat the decreasing per mile cost of some modes of transportation can\nmake significant interregional, competition possible.\nAlthough the results of the FBA estimates of transportation\n\ncosts are perhaps more realistic than any other such input data used\nin coal supply forecasts, there remains natural uncertainty over their\nvalidity for the year 2000. RelatiYely small changes in rate\nschedules and, more importantly, rail links between the vast western\ncoal fields and ma j or growth markets (demand regions) might\nsignificantly alter the regional cost and production forecasts based\nupon them. The JPL study is aware of this and plans to both monitor\nthe possibility of such events, as well as to assess the potential\nimpact on the study\'s price targets.\n\nC\t\n\nGENERATION OF MARKET PRICES AND PRODUCTION\n\nThe optimization model used by EEA is one which minimizes the\ncost of satisfying the given estimated regional demsn s by allocating\nthem among the supply regions, and therefore among the mine -type\nreserve blocks within each supply region, such that the combined costs\nof producing and transporting the coal, is minimized. The summarized\nresults of this production forecast, segregated by region, sulfur\ncategory and surface or underground mine are displayed in Table 4-5.\nThe companion predictions of the 1985 and 2000 market mine-mouth\nprices (MASP, in 1974 dollars) are displayed in Table 4-6.\n\nN\t\nwax\t\n\nFor both 1985 and 2000 the model forecasts similar patterns:\nproduction growth in compliance and low sulfur coal, regions. This\nillustrates the central importance of federal environmental regulations\nand the dry-scrubbing technology. The heavy demand for compliance\ncoal comes from utility plants operating under the original New Source\nPerformance Standards (NSPS). The low sulfur demand largely represents\nutilities under NSPS II minimizing their pollution control costs by dry\nscrubbing low sulfur coal; in fact, this combination is so costeffective that the model projects very little wet scrubbing of high\nsulfur coal. Another regulatory factor is the Fuel Use Act which\nattaches a cost penalty to the use of oil or gns in new industrial\nboilers and thus further encourages demand for low sulfur and\ncompliance coal.\nThe major supply regions that stand to gain from these demand\nfactors are the areas with low sulfur reserves: the West generally,\n\n4-7\n\nTable 11-.4.\n\nComparison of All-Rail Estimated 1985\nUnit-Train Rates\n\nMileage\n\n$/Ton\n\nOne-Way\n\nTon/Mile\n\n19.47\n20.08\n21.73\n\n1,076\n1,110\n1.,630\n\n.018\n.018\n.013\n\n17.44\n\n16.51,\n\n964\n1.,497\n\n.018\n.011\n\n14.41\n11.71\n14.20\n16.35\n16.35\n\n555\n451\n1,137\n1003\n11309\n\n.026\n.026\n.012\n.013\n.013\n\n13.01\n13.111\n\n11149\n1,161\n\n.011\n.011\n\nTo Des Moines, Iowa from:\n10.83\nRook Springs, Wyo,\nGrand Junction, Colo. 10.98\n\n957\n970\n\n.011\n.011\n\nTo Mobile, Ala. from:\nUnion, Pa.\nKansas City, Mo.\nStarlake, N.

Overall, total produotion is\nforecast to rise from 680 million tons in 1976 to 1.092 billion tons\n\nin \'1985 and 2.0\'9 billion tons in 2000. In all three cases most\nprd\'uotion is accounted for by surface. mining, with surface mining\naccounting for 65 percent of the total in 2000. However, the model\ndoes show a resurgence of underground\xc2\xb0mining (primarily drift) in\nAppalachia ( Regions 2-11).\nNote that the prices forecast to prevail in 1985 and 2000 do not\nsignificantly increase in real terms (i.e., in 1979 dollars). This is\nlargely attributable to the large size of the reserve base and the\nmodal\'s embodiment of the "general industry competitiveness" and\n"increasing minor productivity" assumptions discussed in Section Ill.\n\nThe results of the optimization model are actually available in\na much more disaggregated form. Specifically, when demand from one\nregion is "filled" by, or allocated to, a specific supply region on\nthe basis of Least delivered cost, a specific reserve b look/mine type\nis chosen. Each of these "actively producing" mine types is\nidentifiable in the data, along with the order in which they became\nactive within the region. Since these mine types are identified with\nthe geologic characteristics discussed in Sections Ix and lll, they\nlend themselves to more intensive scrutiny and analysis than the\naggregated results presented in Tables 11-5 and 4-6. Advantage is\ntaken of this aspect of the data base to parallel the development\n\nN\xe2\x80\x9e.,.,,.a. , W%4 .gin T,^IUx0^ ^,^-a era =^-v in one following text.\nD.\t\n\nPRICE TARGET DERIVATION: THE DATA\n\nUtilizing the EEA-derived estimates for the year 2000 by region\nand coal type, the supply cost and production data (actual and\npotential,) were identified and partitioned according to the eight\npreviously defined mine-types. Table 4-7 summarizes the division of\nthe estimated underground production for the year 2000 into the output\nof the eight mine types of region. A plurality of underground\nproduction is seen from "yyy" type mines, i.e., from those with\nrelatively thick seams, larger block sizes, and sleeper over-burden.\nFurther, it is noted that two-thirds of this production (and 30 percent\nof total underground) is from Region 13 (the Uinta Basin). On the\nother hand, about 60 percent of total, underground production is\nexpected to come from the three regions (2,3,4) which together\ncomprise Appalachia.\nHowever, knowledge of the probable levels of production at the\ntime of potential new technology adoption is not sufficient. For\nexample, it may be that the new technology will be more attractive\nto mine owners who are considering opening new mines. Therefore the\nreserves remaining to be mined in 2000 are of special interest. Table\n4 -8 presents a reaggregation of the EEA allocations of these remaining\nreserves among the aggregated mine types and region by coal type.\nThese data indicate the possibility of an entirely different post-2000\nregional production picture in that Appalachia now has only about\n\n4-12\n\nTable 4-7 \xe2\x80\xa2 Estimated Underground Production for Target Year 2000\nby Region and Dine Type t million metric tons\n\nMiner\nRegion\n\nlit\n\nlyl\n\nyyy\n\nTotal\n\nlly\n\nlyy\n\nyll\n\nyyl\n\nyl y\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n22.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n4.7\n\n30.3\n\n6\n\n0\n\n14.7\n\n5111\n\n1102\n\n0.3\n\n29.3\n\n136.2\n\n1.\n\n1.1\n\n2.\n\n5.0\n\n3\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n36.7\n\n78.6\n\n0.3\n\n69.8\n\n41.1\n\n36.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.2\n\n264.5\n\n4,\n\n2. 3\n\n7.2\n\n0.3\n\n2.3\n\n2. 4\n\n5.4\n\n0. 6\n\n17.8\n\n38.3\n\n5.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1.9\n\n18.8\n\n0. 2\n\n37.6\n\n58. 5\n\n6.\n7\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n^\xe2\x80\xa2-\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n--\n\n8.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n9.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n_\xc2\xbb\n\n10.\n11.\n12,\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n--\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-_\n\n13,\n14.\n15.\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n214\n0\n\n214\n-R-\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n214.\n\nTOTALS\n\n45.1\n\n110.6\n\n%\n\n(6)\n\n(15)\n\nQ.6\t\n\n86.8\n\n119.4\n\n73.0\n\n-\t\n\n(12)\n\n(16)\n\n(10)\n\n4-13\n\n2.7\t\n\n0-\n\n303.6\t\n\n(41)\t\n\n741.8\n\n.\xc2\xbb.,\n\nI\nTable 11-8, Remaining Haaarvon rar Target Year 2000\nby Region, Coal and Ming Type,\nmillion matrix tong\n\nRe k^ion\n\nlyl\n\n111\n\nfly\n\nlyy\n\nyll\n\nYYl\n\n127.8\n/\n\n10.7\n\n45.7\n\n0 10\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nY\'YY\n\nTotal\n\n0.0\n0. 0\n\n17 9.7\n(\n0. 4\n\n427.1\n1. 1.\n\nYlY\n\n22 .9\n\n40.3\n\n00\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .3\n\n23,1\n\n01 2\n40.5\n\n0.3\n\n127.8\n\n10.7\n\n45.7\n\n0.0\n\n180.1\n\n428.2\n\n2 (10\n2 (L)\n2\n\n66,9\n2.5\n69.4\n\n267.0\n0.0\n267.0\n\n0.9\n0.0\n0.9\n\n465.0\n62.7\n527.7\n\n21.1\n00\n21.8\n\n153.0\n5.6\n158.6\n\n0.0\n0,0\n0.0\n\n665.9\n44.5\n710.4\n\n1640.5\n115.3\n1755.8\n\n3 (H)\n3 (L)\n3 (C)\n3\n\n0.0\n0.0\n010\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n010\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0,0\n0.0\n\n42,9\n153.6\n161.8\n353,3\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n9.6\n34.6\n36.0\n80,2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n81.7\n291.9\n305.7\n679.3\n\n134.2\n480.1\n\n4 (H)\n\n0.3\n0.8\n0.0\n1.1\n\n0.6\n0.0\n0.0\no.6\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n4.2\n9.9\n1.8\n15.9\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0,0\n010\n\n0.0\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n5.3\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0,2\n\n10.7\n1.8\n17.8\n\n5 (H)\n5 (L)\n5\n\n3.0\n0.7\n\n156.3\n6.6\n162.9\n\n26.6\n1.2\n27.8\n\n221.7\n30.0\n251.7\n\n4.2\n0.5\n4.7\n\n567.9\n10.5\n578.4\n\n25.2\n0.9\n26.1\n\n2129,6\n73.6\n2203.2\n\n3134.5\n124.0\n3258,5\n\n6 (H)\n6\n\n0.0\n\n73.9\n73.9\n\n0.0\n0. 0\n\n654.7\n654.7\n\n0.0\no.0\n\n21.6\n21,6\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n180.3\n180.3\n\n930.5\n930.5\n\n2.2\n3.4\n\n4.1\n5.4\n\n11.3\n18,8\n\n0.0\n\n0.7\n\n7.2\n\n29.2\n\n0.0\n\n1.2\n\n11,5\n\n46.3\n\n5.6\n\n9.5\n\n30.1\n\n2.2\n4.3\n6.5\n\n0.0\n\n1.9\n\n18.7\n\n75.5\n\n--\n\n--\n\n1 (H)\n1 (L)\n1\n\n4 (L)\n\n4 (C)\n4\n\n7 (H)\n7 (L)\n\n!]\n\n3.7\n\n0.0\n1,5\n\n7\n\n1.7\n3.2\n\n8\n\n-\n\n0.0\n\n--\n\n4-14\n\n_-\n\n503.5\n\n1117.8\n\n-\n\nTable 4-8.

It should be noticed,\nhowever, that the reserve production from the "yyy\' \xe2\x96\xba -type mines still\ndominates, now accounting for about 60 percent of actually recoverable\nreserves, on a yearly production rate basis.\nOf course, neither of these pictures "captures" the environment\nsufficiently for a unilateral decision with respect to the "best"\nmarket areas and geologic conditions for tho new underground extraction\ntechnology. Specifically, for a teohnolapgy to be commercially\nattractive requires that:\n(l) The hardware developed must be ocmpetitive in terms of net\nrevenue generated (over costs and including ROI) with that\nlikely to exist in the absence of the new system.\n(2) The hardware itself must be developed with attention to\nthe s ecific probable market that must in turn be\ncarefully chosen in order to have a significant, if not\nmaximum, impaot on the industry-wide price of coal and the\naccompanying changes in the health, safety, environmental.,\nand conservation parameters, the incorporation of which\nhave contributed to the uniqueness of this project.\nThus, it will not do, to merely build a "better continuous miner ,\' with\nlimited applicability, even though it does, in Fact, increase\nproductivity, say by 50 percent, and therefore lowers production\ncosts. An example will be useful to indicate the care that must be\nexercised in the use of the data contained in the regional supply\ncurves and in Tables 1 1 -7 and 4-8. As is evident from these data, the\nsupply regions showing the greatest growth in production levels are\nthose with large reserves of compliance and low sulfur coal. These\ninclude central and southern Appiklaohia, the Powder River Basin,\nUinta, and San Juan reserves. This is largely a result of the\ntoughened air pollution standards. Since these standards are not\nlikely to be eased, greater total production in the future will tend\nto mean evon greater increases in the need for compliance coal.\nTable 4-6 shows that the central and southern Appalachia MASPs\nfor compliance coal are significantly higher than those of the other\nregions producing compliance coal. Since it ME seem easier to reduce\nhigher costs than Lower ones, it might be tempting to key on the\ncompliance production of Regions 8 and 4 as "target markets."\nHowever, a look at the Region 4 data in Table 1 4-8 shows that all but\n1.8 million ton g per year of compliance reserves are forecast to be in\nproduction by 2000. This is of courses a relatively small. "market\nsegment." Thus to simply focus on the MASP will not be a proper\n\ndecision criterion. Hut, it is shown that for Region 3 there are\napproximately 500 million tons of compliance coal per year not\nforecast to be in production by 2000. Here the problem is that only\n18 million tons of this reserve presently has an estimated MASP of\nless than $40.00, with 467.5 million ton g of yearly production\n\n\' 4-16\n\n\t\n\nr\n6\nI\n\n"priced" at $48.60 per ton or more. The high MASP should by itself\ninduce an attempt to develop a technology to exploit the reserve. The\nkey is to weigh the cost of the technology against the value of being\nL\nnbla to bring the resource into produotion. The fact that there is a\nbarge volume of revenue is attractive, but a need exists to be sure\nthat the costs of exploiting \'the resource can be brought to a\ncompetitive level.\n\n`.\n\nAnother caveat is that it is easy to let the data point to the\ndevelopment of a technology that has a significant potential market\nsize and has the potential to reduce the cost considerably but with\n\ncost-effectiveness not being reached, for instance, until the year\n\n2050. Developing such a technolog y , while desirable, does not satisfy\nthe goal of this pro;lect. That is, such a huge reserve base exists\nthat the likely - timing of Its entry into production is crucial to this\nproject. This is a complex problem, but must and can be addressed in\nthe generation of the cost guidance for the development of advancers\nextraction systems.\nf\ni\n\nI\t\n\nPinal.l.y, a return to the example of Region 3 versus Region 13 as\nchoices for "target markets" indicates that the choice of a target\nmine-type is not independent (in general) from the choice of the\ntarget region. In Region 3 in the year 2000, the remaining cheapestto-mine (i.e., :lowest MASP) compliance mine was a ll yyl." type that\ncould produce 18.1 million ton: per year at $35.21 per ton. In Region\n13, the compliance mine-type which was moat attractive was a c"yvy"\ntypo which could produce 204.1 million tons at $28.75 per bon. The\nmajor diffe r ence between these two mine-types is that the "yyy" mine\nhas a deeper overburden than the \'l yyl" mine. Thus it may or may not\nbe feasible and cost effective to design a technology which could be\nused in either type mine. In addition, the assignment of such mine\nis7a necessary oversimplification even within a single\ntype codes\nregion. However, bet ween regions even two mines identical in the five\n\ndigit (a2 , a , a ll , a 5 , a6) vector (see Section 11) are not\nnecessarily identical" for the purposes of technology development.\nThis is due to regional differences in such characteristics as roof\nand floor quality, capability, seam regularity, etc. Thus, although\nsome ,judgments about mine types may be valid across regions, in\ngeneral, there is a sufficient number of confounding factors to require\nthat the "target supply region" and "target mine typo" be jointly\n\nconsidered.\nNext, it is noted that the actual, and potential penetration of\nthe longwall. (LW) mining technology in the U.S. market is of direct \t\ninterest to the present project for at least two reasons:\n(1)\n\nIt is a technology that competes, at Least potentially,\nwith others still being developed and thus its market\npenetration could significantly alter the target market\nand cost guidance developed for an advanced system.\n\n(2)\n\nIt is an "innovation" in terms of mining technology and as\nsuch may yield important and instructive guidance with\nrespect to "acceptability" on the part of the coal\nindustry.\n\n4--17\n\nOF\n\nC4\'\n\n1\n\n\t\n\nA LW system has characteristics that may yield significant\nadvantages over Room and Pillar (RP) mines. Specifically, it has been\n\nasserted that;\n\n(1)\n\nLW mines are safer.\n\n(2)\n\nLW mines require less labor.\n\n(3)\n\nLW mining is more productive (30-40 tons per day per\nperson versus 10-20 for RP).\n\nHowever, although it has been predicted that LW would account for 25\npercent of underground production by the 1980 0 s, in 19\',6 it held only\na 4 percent market share, and a. recent study Muti, Nov. 1979,\nReference 6) reduces the estimated LW 1985 market share to only 12\npercent. The major reasons conjectured for this reduction are mine\nowner/operator resistance to the significant operational and\norganizational changes associated with LW, and the barriers posed by\nregulatory requirements (e.g., multiple entries) which reduce its\nexpected profitability.\n\nThese facts and predictions are noted here because any new\nsyatem may have to face some of the same exogenous (with respect to\nthe efficiency of the technology) considerations. Thus, should a new\nsystem turn out to be a significant change from status quo procedures\nand cost shares, it may replace LW as the "most resisted" innovation.\nThis would tend to cause the industry to embrace LW, by then a more\nfamiliar (and acceptable) technology, and to shun the new technology,\nin spite of its cost effectiveness. Although this statement is limited\nto a hypothetical one at this point, it clearly is a consideration\nwhich will be kept in mind by the project staff.\nMore concretely, Table 4-9 indicates that the C gA model forecasts\nthat LW technology will prevail for the year 2000 (Region 13). In\nthis basin, a total of 215 million tons of coal is expected to be\nproduced at a maximum MASP of $25.85 (see Table 4-7). This represents\nalmost 29 percent of the total U.S. undergro und production of 741\nof 2,079 million\nmillion tons and 1,0 percent of the total\ntons. The 63 million tons of predicted production from the same mines\nin 1985 likewise represents about 22 percent of underground, and about\n6 percent of total production. Furthermore, the 5,091.3 million tons\nof underground reserve capacity per year assigned to LW in the other\n43 percent of the remaining reserves\n31 reserve blocks comprise\nin Regions 12-15, and about 19 percent of the total U.S. remaining\n(assigned) reserves.\n\nprod\nuction\n\nover\n\n{\t\n\nThus, the possibility of greater than forecast LW penetration\nmust be investigated, especially when the long run possibility of a\nmore direct transportation link between these supply regions and Dhe\nmajor markets significantly increases the competitiveness. There are\ninnumerable ways to do sensitivity analysis on additional LW market\npenetration (i.e., to reserve blocks not presently assigned to LW).\nHowever, these possibilities must remain suggestions for the time\n\n4-18\n\nbeing, since almost all of these methods require either computerizing\nthe EEA result data base and/or rerunning the EEA model with a\nresulting change in the mine type assignments and cost calculations.\nFirst, an analysis can be made of both the mine code vector\nlisted for each LW assignment, under the column O EEA II in Table 4-9, as\nwell as of the revised aggregate mine codes. A comparison of the\nresults of Il matohing tl candidate subsets of the (a2 - a6) LW\nveotor, with reserve blocks presently assigned to RP mines, Will\ngenerate estimates of regional and coal-type specific LW penetration\nrates.\nFor example, Table 4-9 shows that there are 11 thin seam reserve\nblocks presently assigned to the LW technology category. Thus, if all\nthe reserve blocks (in the 116 11 total) are checked with, say, codes of:\n(1 1\n\nX)\n\nY) Ys X)\n\nwhere x > 0 1 y a 3 1 a set of reserve blocks will be generated for\nwhich LW may- be feasible. As can be seen, the possible variations on\nthis theme are many.\nIn the same spirit, a statistical analysis could be made of\nwhether there are feasible !I LIK assi gnment patterns" not obvious a\npriori, and a determi nation could be made of which patterns (mine\ncodes) dominate. As an example, using only the data from Table 11-9,\nthe following hierarchical structure in terms of mine code can be\nderived:\n\n31.331\n21331\t\n\n11331\t\n31132\t\n\n31332\n32332\n12131\n\n21332\t\n\n12132\n\n1,1.332\t\n\n1 It 1\t\n\n32232\n\n33311\n33132.\n13132\n\nThe arrows indicate lower preferred assignable reserve blocks in terms\nof predicted MASPs. Thus, reserve blocks coded (31331) are likely to\nbe "better" (lower cost) for LW assignment than either of the ones\ncoded (21331) or 132232), which in turn "dominate" a series of\n(transitive) reserve block types. However, on the basis of Table 4-9\ndata, there is not su fficient information to similarly choose betweei\nthe (21331) and (32232) types. This requires more data, if at all\npossible, or a subjective assignment.\n4-19\n\nTable 11-9.

The EEA model\ndoes not explicitly consider the depletion of the identified reserve\nblocks as a result of the yearly production flaw. However, the model\nassumes (for the most part) a 20 - year life span for mines and reserve\nblocks and, as noted in Section III, the derivation of the MASPs are\nmodeled on this basis. Since the new extraction system may affect the\nrate of recovery, and since this recovery rate and the total yearly\nmine life and the resulting depletion may well significantly impact\nthe pattern of the remaining reserves, the construction of the cost\nguidance and the derivation of the target market must show a\nsensitivity to alternative "depletion" and "recovery rate" assumptions.\n\nE.\t\n\n^{\n;\xe2\x82\xac\n\nSTRUCTURING COST GUIDANCE: SUGGESTIONS\n\nTo reiterate, the basic questions to be answered prior to\nattempting to estimate cost guidance for any specific hardware\ndevelopment are:\n(1)\n\nWhich regions are likely to contain the best markets for\nACES?\n\n(2)\n\nWhich mine types within these regions should be selected\nas targets for the technology?\n\nA complete analysis of the above two issues requires knowledge\nof both the supply of and demand for ACES hardware. Since this\nhardware has not yet been developed, it is not feasible to model the\nsupply side. However, some demand information can be derived, namely\nthe amount various potential users would be willing to pay for a new\ntechnology. Another example follows, in order to better illustrate\nthe challenge. Ass ume that:\n(1)\n\nThe EEA estimates of the total and regional demands and\nsupplies and MASPs are exactly correct.\n\n(2)\n\nThe total feasible market for ACES is defined by the\n"remaining reserves" identified in Table 14-8 by region,\nmine and coal type.\n\n(3)\n\nThe costs of the best competitive extracting system in\neach case i`\'` represented by the sequence of estimated\nMASPs.\n\n(4)\n\nThe sequence of pilot tests to be associated with the\nrefinement of ACES hardware in the 1990\'s will have\nsignificantly reduced or removed the need for a "risk\npremium" to the coal company adopting ACES, given that\nthey are shown cost data indicating that they can reduce\ntheir costs with ACES.\n\n4-22\t\n\n1\n\ni\n\nt\t\n\nk\n\nAbstracting for the moment from the interregional and coal-type\nfeatures of the problem, suppose that the year 2000 actual coal\nproduction level, n a region is as shown in Figure 44-1 and is foreoask\nto be qo million tons at an average price of Po dollars, using\nconventional. technologies (at that tame). in order to increase\nregional production above qo million tons, the price per ton must\nrise to pl. At this price, a total annual production increase of\n(q l - qo) million tons are available at p l dollars per ton.\nAnalogous statements hold for the pairs (q2, p2) ano (q 3 , p3).\nIn Figure 4-1 the Line segments AB, CD, EF therefore form a portion of\nthe supply curve for coal from this region.\nNow, suppose that the yearly demand for coal post-2000 increased\nfrom go to q 21 and that the increased production (q 2 - qo) was\nto be sold at the uniform price p2. Then the owners of the newly\nopened mine(s) producing the first (ql - qo) million tons of\nincreased production would be making a "pure e (i.e., over the normal,\n:return on investment) profit of (p2 - pl)\t( q,- q o), while\nthe owners of the newly opened mine(s) producing (q2 - ql) million\ntons of increased production would just be recovering their actual\ncosts plus a normal return on investment.\nAssume that the newly developed advanced extraction system was\napplicable to o nly the type of mine (e.g., 11 yyy") producing the\nn p.\no\naddition\t\nuuu,e.^.i. vua\n(q l - -t) million tons of coal Per . year, and that this\nadditional production would cost $(p l -A ) per ton, again including\nrequired return on investment. Then the shaded area of Figure u-1\nrepresents the total savings to the owners of this reserve block/mine\naccruing from the adoption of the new technology. The quantity\n(q i - qo ), or (q l - qo ) divided by the annual production\ncapacity of a unit of the new hardware, is a measure of the market\nsize for the new technology. The appropriate target price in this\ninstance is thus pl.\n\nl\n\nHowever, consider the following modified scenario. Suppose that\nthe new technology is applicable to neither of the reserve blocks\nassociated with the supply schedule segments AB and CD, but rather\nused in mine types such as those from which (q - q ) would be a factor.\nAlthough the magnitude (p3 - (p -A )] is an Ocura?e measure of the\nunit savings attributable to Q introduction of the new technology,\nit is not a measure of the increased profitability. The index of\nmerit for ACES in a market economy is the difference between the\nmarket price and the MASP given that ACES is used, not the difference\nbetween MASP before ACES and MASP after ACES.\nThe point of the example is simple: care must be taken to\nidentify the most appropriate targets for cost and marketability\ncomparisons. In the example given above, if the cost reduction for\nthe mine-type producing segment EF was considered as a measure of the\npotential marketability one could easily be led astray. The choice of\nthe target region and mine type depends heavily on the next best\nalternative.\n\nG-23\n\n\t\n\nF\n\nE\t\n\nP3\t\n\n,\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nt\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nr\n\n.\t\nn\t\n\nC\t\nP 2--\n\n.D\n^^lr.a!!!!!lsl^^ls!!.!\nt\t\n\nn\t\n\nn\n\nt\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nn\t\n\n\\\n.\n\nr\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n...! ! \xe2\x80\xa2t.\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2. n ...... n .!\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\nt\n\n^\t\n\nt\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n!a\n\nn\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA\t\n\nPi\t\n\n(P 1\t\n\nn\n\nr\t\n\nY\t\n,\t\n\n!\t\n!\t\n\nn\nM\n\nMA\xe2\x80\xa2.. n ...\xe2\x80\xa2.a.F n \\ n }!!!! n !.\xe2\x80\xa2 . n f YNN\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2Y n 1f!!Y!A!!.!!l.....\xe2\x80\xa2..l.\nY\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n!\n\nr\t\n\nr\t\n.\t\n\nP......\n\no\n\nn\t\n\nr\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2..l\xe2\x80\xa2.l..Y\\\xe2\x80\xa2l\xe2\x80\xa2.f! n 4:e!!l..11...\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2..

The potential,\nsensitivity of such guidance to the assumptions and methodology\nembodied in the preceding pages requires a word of caution. Although\nthese cautionary notes are contained in the subsections above, they\nwill be summarized here for ease of reference. They are listed in\norder of decreasing importance, i.e., in terms ot` the probability of\n\nhaving an impact on the present target prices and target market\ncharacteristics.\n(l) The exclusion in the present results of the possibility\n\nthat specific reserve blocks might, be depleted, or at,\nleast be nearing depletion by the year 2000, may cause the\nestimated market MASPs to be too :low, and the most\nattractive now markets for an advanced extraction system\n\nto \'ae inaccurately characterized.\n(2)\n\nThe use of only a subset of the geologic parameters to\ndefine the mine types that are to provide the basis for\nthe choice among target markets as well as the structure\nfor the regional price targets may be a source of\nsubstantial. bias.\n\n(3)\n\nThe assumptions _regarding relative_productiviy of surface\n(versus underground) mining may Wtell turn out to be\nconsistent with the JPL companion work of constructing a\n"moving baseline\' s technology; nonetheless, these\nassumptions have the capacity to significantly alter\nrelative regional price targets and target market choices.\n\n(4)\n\nions\nThe defensible, but arguable, assumptions made to define\n"low," "medium" and "high" cost mines in Appalachia could\nhave had an inappropriate impact on Appalachian versus\nother region\'s estimated MASPs and production levels, and\non forecast surface versus underground production as Well.\n\n(5)\n\nAlthough the estimated transportation costs used in the\nforecast of "delivered" coal prices to the demand regions\nwere developed in such a way as to be the most up-to-date\nand accurate, the possibility of future new transportation\nlinks between the coal-rich western supply regions and\nmajor demand centers may well understate actual future\nwestern production.\n\n5-1\n\n(6)\n\nThe MASP concept appears reasonable, but may obscure some\n\nbasic supply price implications, especially for mines\nwhich might open in extremely large reserve blocks and\noperate at less than full production. This potential\nnon-linearity of average costs iti specific reserve blocks\nmay have a significant impact on predicted market prices,\nand thug on the cost guidance furnished in this report.\n(7)\n\nAlthough the market pricelproduotion forecasting process\nnssumes that the coal industry stru cture is essentially\ncompetitive (Kaplan, Reference 5) a closer look at the U.S.\ncoal, supply sector suggests that there may be significantly\nless effective competition than the raw number of coal\nsuppliers ( 3,000+) and coal. mines ( 6,000+) might indicate\n(Office of Technology Assessment, Reference 7). indeed, a\nrecent study by the Office of Technology Assessment\nindicates that long-term contracts cover about 86 percent\nof they coal p podueed. Since the contract length tends to\nbe set equal to the expected (or desired) life of the\nmine, the existence of these contracts \xe2\x96\xba^\xe2\x96\xbaay have\nsignificant implications for the marketability of a new\ntechnology.\n\n(8)\n\nThe resource base estimates included "inferred reserves"\nas well as those "measured" and "indicated." Although the\nscope and time frame of the project makes this extension\nof the usual "reserve" base to a "resource" base\nappropriate, the unavoidable uncertainty surrounding such\nestimates, given the detailed level of their use, may have\nan unknown impact on predicted MASPs and target market\n\nderivations.\n(9)\n\nAlthough the study team is convinced that the aggregate\nand regional demand estimates are reasonable given the\npresent expectations for exports and synfuel use, the\nexistence of increasingly credible forecasts of a dramatic\nshift to coal as a substitute fuel may well lead to nonmarginal increases in aggregate demand, and significantly\naffect predicted target prices and markets.\n\n(10) The stability of forecast MASPs and production levels may\nbe sensitive to possible variations in the assumed required\nROls and risk premiums associated with the adoption of a\nsignificant new technology in a major industry such as\n\ncoal,.\n(11)\n\nA variation in the "\'longwall assignment" algorithm could\nLead to a significant increase in predicted market\npenetration, and therefore to a modification in the\nregional, price targets and target market size estimates.\n\nit is recommended that effort be devoted to quantifications of\nthe probable size of the most important of those qualifications listed\n\n5-2\n\nabove. Further, it would appear very valuable to develop a eescalar\nmeasure" of target market size as discussed previously. To the extent\nsuch a construct can be obtained, the task of narrowing market choices\n(and price guidance) to a small number of possibilities will be\ngreatly simplifia O This effort requires both the development of an\ninternally consistc-t candidate measure and its testing, using the\navailable data base described hare. It is believed that the\nintegration of the results of such an effort with those of the JPL\nmoving baseline will greatly strengthen the effort to develop an\nadvanced coal extraction system with large commercial appeal.\n\ne\n\nFOOTNOM\n\n1 "Coal Models and Their Use in Government Planning," JPL-,-jponsored\nseminar, Carmel, California, July 16 and 17, 1979,\n2Thi3 distribution was determined by comparing the cu m ulative\ntannage in each sulfur category (as estimated by the USDM) to the\naverage Btu content by region.

Since capital cost\nchanges will not affect the clean tonnage calculation, the percentage\nchange in MASP is equal to the percentage change in the revenue\ncalculation. That is:\nMASP\'\t\nMASP\t\n\nREV\'\nREV\' CLEAN\t\nREV LEAN REV\n\nwhere the prime superscript indicates the amount of MASP that is\ntechnology- dependent capital costs.\nFor situation 1 REV, is\nREV \t\n\nCASH +0.15 TOTOP -0.5 DPCN\n- 0.5s\n0.55 - 0.5r\t\n\nMaximum technology-dependent capital costs are the sum of deferred and\n, terms\nother initial capital costs.
