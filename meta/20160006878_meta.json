This process was developed by researchers at NASA Langley to specifically address needs for aerospace applications. Additive manufacturing technologies like EBF3 enable efficient design of materials and structures by tailoring microstructures and chemistries at the local level to improve performance at the global level. Additive manufacturing also facilitates design freedom by integrating assemblies into complex single-piece components, eliminating flanges, fasteners and joints, resulting in reduced size and mass. These same efficiencies that permit new design paradigms also lend themselves to supportability and sustainability. Long duration space missions will require a high degree of self-sustainability. EBF3 is a candidate technology being developed to allow astronauts to conduct repairs and fabricate new components and tools on demand, with efficient use of feedstock materials and energy.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160006878, "endDate": "2015-03-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Minerals, Metals and Materials Society", "location": "Warrendale, PA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "db5b876d932342a594f202f7a0d0fd7a", "id": "b5596257e16c4ca985bee88065e9afe3"}], "name": "Annual Meeting and Exhibition of The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society (TMS)", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "db5b876d932342a594f202f7a0d0fd7a", "startDate": "2015-03-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160006878, "id": "736a4b8548044cbca3ff5061d3245b3e", "publicationDate": "2015-03-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20160006912, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "EBF3 Design and Sustainability Considerations", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160006878.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160006878/downloads/20160006878.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160006878/downloads/20160006878.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160006878/downloads/20160006878.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
