INTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years laser radar (iidar) systems have developed into useful\ntools for remote monitoring of the earth\'s atmosphere. Satellite-borne\nlidar systems provide the attractive feature of wide coverage and in some\ncases may be the only practical means of probing the upper atmosphere.\nThe quality of lidar data depends of course on the system noise characteristics.\nThe receiver output will be contaminated by the usual background and shot\n.noise components and in some cases by speckle noise. In certain situatiois \t\n\n4\n\nspeckle noise dominates and can seriously limit system performance.\nLaser speckle has been studied extensively. Goodman\n\npublished one\n\nof the earliest papers describing speckle effects on optical radar\nperformance and recently an entire issue of the Journal of the Optical\nSociety\n\nwas devoted to speckle. In this report we develop and summarize\n\nthe equations which relate the statistics of the speckle noise at the\nreceiver output to the lidar system parameters. Ibrtunately, we were\nable to adapt much of the existing theory to the satellite-based lidar\nproblem. Much of the material was obtained from the books Laser Speckle\nand Related Phenomend edited by J. C. Dainty\n\nand Statistical Properties of\n\nScattered Light by Crosignani, Di Porto and Bertolotti 4 and from the\nNovember 1976 special issue of JOSH on speckle.\nThe lidar system model is described in Section II, and in Section III\nthe statistics of the signal and noise at the receiver output are derived.\nScattering media effects are discussed in Sections IV and V. Polarization\nand atmospheric turbulence are considered in Sections VI and VII. And\nfinally, in Section VIII, the major equations are summarized and evaluated\nfor some typical system parameters.\n\nX\n\nII. SYSTEM MODEL\n\nA typical satellite-based lidar system is illustrated in Figure 1. The\ntransmitting telescope is used to project an image of the optical source\nonto the scattering medium. In most cases the source would be a narrowband\nlaser. However, since speckle noise is significantly influenced by source\ntemporal coherence, we will assume only that the source coherence bandwidth\nis a small percentage of the center wavelength. Although a major portion of\nthe propagation path will be in free space, in the lower atmosphere turbulence effects could become important and will be considered. The scattering\nmedium could be a rough surface such as the earth or an ensemble of\nI\nscattering centers such as aerosols (clouds) and air molecules.\nThe receiving telescope model is illustrated in Figure 2. The spatial\nfilter following the objective lens is normally a field-of-view (FOV) stop\nwhich is used to reject background radiation. After the field stop the\noptical signal is collimated, passed through an interference filter and then\nfocused oi:..o a photodetector. Finally, the signal from the photodetector\nis passed through an electrical filter to further limit the system\nI\nbandwidth.\nThe problem we are concerned with is the detestability of the scattered\nsignal. The receiver output will be contaminated by the usual background and\nshot noise components and in some cases by speckle noise. In certain\nsituations speckle noise dominates and can seriously limit system performance.\nIn the following sections we will present the equations which relate the\nstatistics of the photodetector output to the lidar system parameters and the\ncharacteristics of the scattering medium.\n\n2\n\nTransmitting\n^ Telescope\n\nReceiving\t\nTelescope ^\t\n\n`J\tAtmospheric\nTurbulence\nTarget Surface\n\na\n\nFig. 1.

STATISTICS OF THE RECEIVED SIGNAL\n\nThe signal statistics at the receiver output can be deduced from the\nstatistics of the optical radiation incident on the receiver aperture. Let\nu(r,z,t) be the analytic signal representation for a single polarization\ncomponent of the electrical field. For a quasi-monochromatic field u takes\nthe form\n\nu(r,z,t) = IA(r,z,t)le\nwhere \xc2\xa9 is the phase and w\n\nc\n\ni6\n\ne\n\niw\n\nt\n\nc\t(1)\n\nis the center frequency. For the moment we will\n\nassume the scattering medium is diffuse so that the received field consists\nof a large number of randomly phased contributions arising from different\nscattering centers. ^f the scatterers are randomly distributed over distances\nwhich are large compared to the optical wavelength, the scattered signal will\nbe incoherent. Under these conditions A is Gaussian distributed while the\nintensity obeys negative exponential statistics\n9\n\n\t\n\t1(r,z,t)\n\n=\n\n\tp(I)\n\nJAI\n\n(2)\n\ni\n= I exp(- I )\t\n< >\n< >>\n\n(3)\t\n\nwhere <I> is the average intensity.\nThe scattering conditions can be relaxed to include the cases where the\n\t\n\nsurface is not rough compared to A and where the scattered field contains a\n\ni\n\ncoherent specular component. These situations are discussed in Section IV.\nTo calculate the signal statistics at the receiver output,it will be\nnecessary to evaluate the mean and covariance function of the intensity\nr\t\nF\t\n\nfluctuations\n\n4\n\n\t\n\nC T (r i0 t I1-29 t 29 z) - <I(r i ,z,t l )I(r 2 ,z,t 2 ) > - <I(rl,z,t1)> <I(r2\'z,t^)> .\n(4)\nSince the field A is a circular complex Gaussian random variable, the\ncovariance function can be expressed in terms of the mutual intensity of\nthe field\'\n\nCI\n\n= I<A(rl,z,t1)p (r2.z,t2)>I^ = IJA(rl\'tl\'r2\'t2\'z)I2 \t\n\n(5)\n\nThe mutual intensity function depends on the characteristics of the\nspattering medium and the incident optical signal. In Sections IV and V\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nwe shoe that for most casts of interest it can be assumed that A is spatially\nhomogeneous in the transverse direction. The temporal dependence of A arises\nfrom a number of factors. Movement of the scattering centers with respect\nto the receiving telescope caused by Brownian motion, turbulence, wind, or\nspacecraft motion will introduce temporal fluctuations. Those effects are\ngenerally stationary. However, if the optical source is pulsed and the\ndensity of scatterers varies with distance (z), the average value of the\nreceived intensity will change with time. Phis effect can be included in\nour analysis by writing the mutual intensity function in the following form\n(see Section V)\ni A (r l ,t l ,r 2 ,t 2 ,z) = D(t l9 t 2 0A (r I - r 2 ,t l - t 2)\t\n\n(6)\n\nD(t i ,t 2 ) is given by\n\nD(t l ,t 2 ) = f dzP(t l - z )P(t 2 - Zz) Z\t\n\n(7)\n\nU\n\nE\t\n\nwhere P is the incident pulse shape and p is the number density of scatterers.\nIf the scattering medium is a rough surface, p is a Dirac delta function and\n\n5\n\n- -- -- --\t\n\n..\n\n\t\n\nD(t l ,t2 ) becomes\ns2\n\nD(t l ,t 2 ) = P(t l - cz ) P(t \') -\n\n2) 2\t\nz\n\n(8)\n\nz\nwhere B r is the surface reflectivity. Using Equations (6) and (7), the\nintensity covariance function can be written as\n\nC I = D 2 (t 19 t 2\n\nJ A (r I - r 2 , t\n\n- t2)I2\n\n\t\n\n(9)\n\nI\nThe average intensity is obtained by simply evaluating the mutual intensity\n1\n\t\n\nfunction at the point r\n\n= r 2 and t i = t2\n(10)\n\n<I> = D(t,t)J A (0,0)\t\n\nWe assume the receiver FOV and interference filter are adjusted to\nadmit all the scattered signal energy which is incident on the telescope\nobjective. The total received signal intensity can therefore be written as\n\n(11)\n\nI s (t) = fd 2 rW(r - vt)I(r,z,t)/ fd 2 rW(r)\t\n\nwhere W is an appropriate real and positive aperture weighting function and\nv is the transverse spacecraft velocity. W is dimensionless. Note for a\npoint detector lJ is just a Dirac delta function.\nTwo types of receiver sf.ructures will be considered. The analog\nreceiver is applicable to strong signal conditions where h(t) is a low-pass\nfilter (see Figure 2). Mien the signal is weak, h is an integrator whose\noutput is proportional to the number of detected photons. In both cases the\nnoise at the receiver output will depend oil\n\n6\n\n\t statistics of I .\n\nS\n\n4\nThe mean and variance of the signal at the receiver output can be\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\ncalculated using; Campbell\'s theorem\nE[s(t)) - a <I s (t)\n\nVar[s(t)] = a <I\n\n>\n\n* 1 i(t)\t\n\ns (t)>\n\n(12)\n\n*h 2(t)\n\nm\n+ a2 J d T\n\nI\n\nf dT 2 C 1 (-[\ns\n\n19 7 2 )h(t\n\n- T 1 )h(t -\n\nT 2 )\t\n\n(13)\n6\n\nThere a is a constant which depends on the 2hotodetector efficiency and C1\ns\nis the temporal covariance function of the received signal.\nThe variance of S can be regarded as the signal induced noise. The\nfirst term in (13) is the quantum or shot noise component arising from the\nrandom emission of photoelectrons by the detector. The second term arises\nfrom the speckle induced fluctuations in Is.\nThe average value of I s is calculated from (I1) using (10)\n<I s (t)> = D(t,t)^A(0,0)\t\n\n(14)\n\nThe temporal covariance of i s can be written to terms of ^ and I)\n\n1\t\n\nrj^ (r+ VT,T)I\nC1 (t l ,t 2 ) = D ` (t l ,t 2 ) J d 2 _\t\n_\t\n\nS\t\n\ni\n\nT =\n\nz Rw (r)\t\n_\n\n(151\n\nt - t2\n\nR is the autocorrelation function associated with the receiver\nw\ni\n\naperture weighting function\n\nR14 (r)\n\nj d2 r W ( p ) W *( p + r)\t\n\nThe average value of\n\nSW\n\n(16)\n\ncan now be evaluated by substituting; (14)\n\ninto (12) and usi ng (7)\n00\n\nE[S(c)J\n\n= aJA(0,0,\xe2\x80\xa2r.) f dzP 2 (t - Z)*h(t) p-(2)\t\no\t\n\n--\t\n\n-db\t\n\nZ\n\nn\n\nis\n\n(17)\n\nThis expression can be further simplified by assuming the transmitter pulse\nwidth and receiver bandwidth are chosen so that the small scale structure\nin p(z) can be resolved. In this case p(z)/z 2 is approximately constant\nover the important range of integration in (17). By choosing the time\nreference so that P and h peak at t - 0 we have\n\nE[S(t)] = cl^ (0,0,z) p(ct/2\' f dzP 2 (t - 2z )*h(t)\t\nc\n0\t\n`\t\n\n(18)\n\nUnder the same conditions the expression for the variance becomes\n\nVar[s(t)] = a1 (O,o,z) ^t/2) f dzP 2 (t - 2z)*,,2(t)\nA\t\n(ct/2)2\t\n0\t\nc\n\n+ a\t\n\n4\t\n\n4 fd r j dTIJ A (r + vT,T) I R 2 (T)R h (T)R w (r)\t\n\n(19)\n\n(et/2)\n\nwhere\n^\t\n\nm\n\nR p 0) = f dtP(t)P(t + T)\nW\nR 1i (T) = f dTh(L)h(t + T)\n\n_m\nR and % are the autocorrelation functions associated with Lhe transmitted\np\npulse shape and impulse response of the receiver filter.\nIt is instructive to consider the physical implications of (19). If\nthe receiver employs a point detector of infinite bandwidth, both R\n\nand\n\nR 1 are Dirac delta functions, in which case the second term in (19) reduces\nto the square of the average intensity. For a finite aperture and finite\nbandwidth receiver, R w and R\nr\n\n1\n\nare rather broad functions of r and T with\nti\n\nare also maximum when their\n\npeak values at r = T = 0. Since J A and R\np\n\narguments are zero, ( 19) will be less than the average Intensity when a\nfinite aperture and finite bandwidth receiver is used. In this case the\nreceiver spatially and temporally averages the intensity fluctuations. The\naveraging will depend ;pon the relationship between the spatial and temporal\n\n8\n\n\t\n\ncoherence lengths of the received signal and the receiver aperture size\nand bandwidth. The averaging will also depend upon the transmitted pulse\nlength through the R2 factor in (19). At any given time t, the signal\nenergy incident on the receiver aperture arises from an illuminated\nscattering volume whole thickness is determined by the transmitter pulse\nlength. The scattered signals arising from each of the illuminated\nscattering centers add on an amplitude basis. Consequently, the spatial\nstatistics of the intensity are unaffected by the pulse length (aside from\na possible scaling factor). However, since the signals mattered by different\ncenters are uncorrelated, the received intensities at two difiLrent times\nwill be partiall correlated only if the corresponding scattering volumes\nhave some points in common. Overlapping will occur only if the time\ndifference is smaller than the transmitted pulse length. The intensities\nwill be uncorrelated if the time difference is larger than the pulse length.\nThe temporal statistics are also affected by the source coherence, random\nmotion of the scattering centers and spacecraft motion. These effects\nappear in the\nthe\n\n\xe2\x96\xba\n\n^A\n\nfactor in (19). The spatial statistics are determined by\n\nra n smitter beam divergence, characteristics of the scattering medium\n\nand propagation t - fects such as turbulence. These factors are discussed in\nmore detail in Sections IV and V.\nThe relative importance of spatial and temporal coherence length, pulse\nlength, aperture size and receiving bandwidth can be determined by evaluating\n(18) and (19) for the idealized case where all the functions are Gaussian\n\nti\t\n\n2r2\n\nIJ A (r,t)!^ - !J A (0,0)I\t\n\n_\n\n(20)\n2v 2\t\nC\t\n\nP(t) - exp\n\nt2\n\nexp(-\n\n(\xe2\x80\x94\n\n2\n-2 \t\n2T\n\nP\n9\n\n)\t\n\nt\t\n\nc\n\n(Z1)\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n(22)\n\nh(t) = exp(-t2B2)\n\n2 \t\nW(r) - exp(- r2)\nR\n\n(23)\n\nwhere\nP c = transverse spatial coherence length of signal\nT c - temporal coherenc f, length of signal\nt\n\nP\n\n= transmitter pulse length\n\nB = detector bandwidth\nK = receiver Lperture radius.\n\nUsing (20) through (23) in (11), (18) and (19) gives\n\n1\'.[S(t\t\n\nA\t\n\n(0, 0) P (ct /2) ItcIP_\t\n\n(24)\n\n(ct/2)2 2B\n\n2\nVar[S(t)] = E S) + F(\' ^ \t\n\n(25)\n\nF MS"T\nwhere\n\n2\nMS\n\nI\n\n+K\n2\n\nP\n\nC\n\ni\nMT\t =\n\n\t\n\n1\t\n\nC\t\n\nv`\t\n+\n\n1\t\n\n1 + B2 T2\t\n\n(26)\n\nB2(R2\n\n+ B2T2 +\np\t\n\n(21)\nP2)\nc\n\nThe equations are valid for scattering by tenuous med.,i such as low\ndensity aerosol distributions and air molecules. For rough surface\n\nscattering the\nP(ct/2)\n(ct/2)2\nfactor must be replaced by\nB2\n\nr\n\n2\n\n10\n\nL\n\ni\xe2\x96\xba (24) and\n\nT\n\np set equal to infinity in the expression for MT.\n\nThe average signal. varies with time in proportion to the density of\nscatterers. The (ct/2) -2 factor .accounts for decav in signal strength as\nthe distance between the spacecraft and illuminated scattering region\nincreases with time. The first term in the variance expression is the \t\nshot noise component. It is proportional to the mean signal. The speckle\nnoise com p onent is proportional to the square of the mean signal and\ninversely proportional to MS P1T , the effective number of received correlation cells. M S is the effective number of spatial correlation cells\naveraged by the receiver aperture while MT is the effective number of\ntemporal correlation cells.\nTo reduce speckle noise we would like to make M S and \'IT as large as\npossible. The parameters R, B and 4 are generally inflexible. The\naperture size k is constrained by weight limitations and the physical\nconstruction of the spacecraft. The detector bandwidth B is determined by\nthe required range resolution. And of course the spacecraft velocity is a\nfunction of the orbit. Thus the only parameters which may be adjusted are\no\t\n\nc\t\n\nT\n\nc\n\nand\n\nTp.\n\nThe coherence time of the scattered radiation depends on the scattering\nmedium and source coherence. If the scattering medium is a rough surface\nthen\n\nT\n\nis exactly equal to the source coherence time. If the scattering\n\nmechanism is resonant absorption and reradiation, then\n\nT\n\nc is equal to the\n\ninverse Doppler line width. For air molecules dominated by Brownian motion,\nis on _;ie order of 1 ns. If Rayleigh scattering from air molecules or\naerosol and particulate scattering is involved, then r\nwhere\n\nI\n\nT\n\nc\t\n\n(T - 2 + T-\n\nd\n\n2)-1/2\n\nc\n\nsc is the source coherence time and 1/[ d is the Doppler line width.\n\nis on the order of 1 ns for air molecules governed b y Brownian motion and\n\n11\n\nI\n\n1 ms for aerosols or particles embedded in n *-^rbulent flow (e.g., clouds\nand smoke plumes). Therefore, except for resonant scattering,\n\nT\n\ncan be\n\ncontrolled by varying the source coherence time.\n.\n\nM.r can also be increased by reducing the source pulse length T\n\nBut,\n\nP\nthere is a practical limit to the reduction. To keep the per pulse signal\nenergy constant, the peak intensity must be increased as z p is decreased.\nHowever, when resonant scattering is involved, the peal: energy density in\nthe scattering medium must be maintained below saturation levels. This\nproblem is most important when the density of scatterers is low.\nIn the absence of strong turbulence effects p c is a function of the\nsize of the illuminated spot on the scattering medium and the distance\nfrom the scatterers to the receiver. If the whole transmitted beam illuminates the s\t\n\ntering medium we have (see Section IV)\n_ A\t\npc 6\n\nwhere A is the wavelength and e\n\n(2H)\n\nis the transmitter divergence angle. If\n\nthe transmitter is operating at the diffraction limited divergence,then\n\neT R_\n\n\t\n\n(29)\n\nwhere RT is the transmitter aperture radius. Usually the transmitter and\nreceiver apertures are nearly equal in size. Thus M S = 2 for diffraction\nlimited operation. The transmitter divergence normally will be much larger\nthan the diffraction limited value to minimize pointing and tracking problems.\nIf the transmitter divergence is increased, the receiver FOV must also be\nincreased so that the receiving telescope sees all of the illuminated\nscattering volume. Unfortunately, background noise power increaser with\nFUV. If the background noise results from an extended diffuse source, its\ncharacteristics will be -\'.\xe2\x80\xa2liar to the scLttered signal since both are\nincoherent and Gaussian.\n12\n\n\t\nWWWWWIIM^r- "V-SA\n\nUniform background noise sources can be described by their spectral.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nradiance function, N(f), which is defined as the power radiated at\nfrequency f per Hertz bandwidth into a unit solid angle per unit of source\narea.7 If the source fills the receiver FOV, the effective average noise\nintensity incident on the receiver aperture is\n<In(r,z,t)> = J n (0,0) = N(f)B 1 0 r\t(30)\n\nJ 11 is she noise mutual intensity function, B\n\nI\n\nis the bandwidth of the\n\nreceiver\'s interference filter and 11 r is the solid angle FOV of the receiver.\nBecause Q\n\nis matched to the transmitter divergence and ma y change, it is\n\nconvenient to normalize I n with respect to a standard FOV such as the\ndiffraction limited value.\n\nRAT 2\n< I n > = Jnd\n\n\xc3\xa2\n\n(0 1 0) (-\t\n\n-)\n\n2\nJndk(0,0) = N(f)B 1 (R)\t\n\n(31)\n\nJndX is just the effective noise intensity for a diffraction limited FOV.\nThe mean ind variance of the noise voltage at the receiver output can\neasily he calculated if we use the form in (20) for the noise intensity\ncorrelation.\n\nRE3\n\n2\t\n\nE(11(t)J = E(n dk )( X )\nT\n\n1/2 RG 2\n\n= aJndQ(0,0) B\n\nE(n ) FE3 2\t\n\nVarin(t)J = \t\n\n\t\n\n32k\n\n( ^\t\n\n( \xe2\x80\x94^ )\t\n\t\n\n4\n\nE(n ) 2 R\xc2\xa9\n\n+ NSNd \xc3\xa2,\t\n\n(\n\nA\n\n(32)\n\n)\t\nT\n\n(33)\n\nwhere\nR\xc2\xa9T 2\nN S = I + (\t\n\n13\n\n)\t\n\n(34)\n\n\t\n\n\tN\n\n=\n\nI +\n\n1+\n\n1/2\n\n2\t\n\nB 2\t\n\n(35)\n\nv\t\n\n2\t\n\nT_J\n\nThe spatial coherence length of the background noise is determined by the\nreceiver FOV and is equal to a/6 T .\n\nThe temporal coherence length is\n\ndetermined by the interference filter bandwidth and is equal to 1/B I.\nBackground noise contaminates the receiver output by adding a DC component and introducing additional shot noise and speckle noise. Normally\nthe speckle noise component will be small since the interference filter\nbandwidth is usually much larger than the detector bandwidth. For example,\n!\t\n\n\t6T\n\nthe bandwidth of a 1 X interference filter centered at 530 rim is nearly\n100 GHz compared to detector bandwidths of 1 GHz or less. Thus N T is on\nthe order of 10 2 or larger.\nAlthough signal induced speckle noise will decrease with increasing\n8 T , background shot noise and speckle noise will increase.

Usual l y E(n dZ ) will be\nvery small since it applies to the diffraction limited receiver. In most\ncases, therefore, the total noise in (37) is approximately equal to the\nsignal shot noise. However, it may not be practical to achieve the optimum value in (37), particularly if the transmitter divergence given by\n(36) exceeds the angular size of the target.\nAlthough the mean and variance of the signal plus background noise\nare useful parameters for accessing the lidar system\'s performance, a\ncomplete analysis requires knowledge of the signal and noise probability\ndistributions. The instantaneous intensity evaluated at a single point is\nexponentially distributed if the scattered signal and noise are both\n.\t\n{\t\nI\n\ncompletely incoherent [see Equation (3)] and the photon counting statistics\nare Bose--Einstein distributed.\n\n4\n\nBecause the receiver integrates the\n\nintensity over space ar:d time, the intensity statistics will be modified.\nGoodman has shown that the gamma distribution is a good approximation for\nthe probabiliLy density of the integrated speckle patterns\nm m-1\t\n\t\n( \xe2\x80\x94 ) I exp (-m\t\n\n\tm\np(1) _\t\n\n-1\t\n\nr\n\nI\n1>\n\n)\n(38)\t\n\n(m)\t\n\nI > 0\nwhere m is equal to M\n\nM\n\nS T\n\nfor the scattered signal and N S N,F for the background\n\nnoise. The photon counting distribution associated with (38) is the\nnegative binomial distribution. If desired,the exact probability density of\nintegrated speckle can be calculated by expanding the scattered field in a\nKarhunen-Loevre series.\n\n5\n\nThe signal statistics derived in tFis section are summarized in\nSection VIII where they are evaluated fot some typical system parameters.\n\n15\n\ni\n\nIV. SCATTERING BY A ROUGH SURFACE\n\nIn the previous section it was shown that the speckle noise power\ncould be calculated from knowledge of the intensity covariance function\nof the received signal.\n\nC I = <I(r l ,z,t I ) I(r 2 ,z,t 2 )> - <I(rl,z,tI)><I(r2.z.t2)>\t\n\n(39)\n\nIf the surface is rough compared to the optical wavelength, the scattered\nfield is a complex circular Gaussian process. The ma--nitude of the\nscattered field is Rayleigh distributed and the intensity is exponentially\ndistributed.\t\n\nIn this case the intensity correlation function can be\n\nwritten in terms of the mutual intensity of the field.5\n\nC I = I<A(r l ,z,t 1 ) A*(r 2 .z.t 2 )>I 2 = jJ A (r l .t l .r 2 .t 21 Z)I 2\t(40)\n\nIf the surface also possesses a specular scattering region which is\ntoo small to be resolved by the receiving telescope, then the scattered\nfield will contain a coherent component. In this case the intensity\ndistribution is a modified Rician density.5\nX\n\np (I)\n\n=\n\nI\t\n<I\n\nr\t\n\nI + I s\t\n>\n\nex\n\n- ^I >\n\nr\t\n\n\t\n\n1\nJ`^s\n10 2 <\n\nI\t\n\n(41)\n\nr\n\nI > 0\n\nwhere I r is the random intensity component and I s is a coherent specular\ncomponent.\n\n1\n\nis a modified Bessel function of the first kind.

In this\ncase the intensity distribution is also a modified Rician density.\nThe mutual intensity in the observation plane can be written in terms\nof the mutual intensity in the scattering plane using the Huygens-Fresnel\nprinciple. If the observation plane is in the Fraunhofer zone, we have\n\n\t\nA(r \' z,t) = az eXl\' (-i az r2) J d2pA s (o,t) exp li az p \xe2\x80\xa2 rl\n\nwhere A\n\ns\n\n(42)\n\nis the scattered field directly in front of the scattering plane.\n\nIn most cases the scattered field can be approximated by the formulas\n\nA s ( p ,t) =\n\n1\t\n\nb r A (P - vt,t) exp i\t\n\n(43)\n\n2h(p)\t\n\nbr is the average sur\xc2\xb0acs reflectivity, A i is the complex amplitude of the\nincident field, v is ti:e transverse velocity of the spacecraft and h(p) is\nthe random height distribution of the scattering surface.

Thus,\nv should be replace by 2v In the analyses in Section III.\n\n20\n\nV. SCATTERING BY A RANDOM DISTRIBUTION OF SMALL PARTICLES\n\nScattering by an ensemble of particles differs from rough surface\nscattering because the particles are generally in motion, resulting in a\ncontinually changing scattering medium. The trajectories of molecules\nare usually governed by Brownian motion while the motion of material\nparticles such as aerosols are determined by the surrounding medium.\nThe book, Statistical Properties of Scattered Light, by Crosignani,\nDi Porto and Bertolotti4 gives an excellent treatment of this subject.\nthe spatial statistics of the scattered field are very similar to\nthose for rough surface scattering. However, the temporal statistics\nare considerably different because of the random particle motion. The\nevaluation of the scattered field is greatly simplified by using the\nRayleigh-Gans hypothesis. This hypothesis is similar to the weak\nscattering assumption often used in turbulence problems. Physically,\nthe Rayleigh-Gans h y pothesis implies that the scatterer introduces a\nsmall optical perturbation to the surrounding medium and that each point\nof the scatterer sees the incident field practically unperturbed.

If we denote these two polarization components\nby I 1 and 1 2 their average intensities are given by\n\n<1 1 > = <1 T >(1 + P)\n2\n<1 2 >\t\n\n\t\n\n(80)\n\n2IT>(1 - P)\n<\n\nwhere <I T > is the total average intensity and P i.: the degree of polarization.\nBecause I I and\n\n1\n\nare uncorre:lated, the intensity covariance function\n\n,in be written as\nC I T = CI1(rl,r,,,tl,t,^) + C IL (r l ,E-,,t l ,t^)\t\n\n28\n\nn\n\n(81)\n\nThe spatial and temporal correlation lengths of I I and 1 2 are identical\nand may be calculated using the procedures outlined in Sections IV and V.\nThus C I and C I have the same functional form but differ in magnitude.\n\n1\t\n\n\'\t\n\n2\n\nThis implies\n\nC11\t\n\nC12\t\n\nCIT\t\n<IT> 2\t<1I> 2\t\n\n<12>2\n\n(82)\n\nSince the analysis in the previous sections was based on completely\npolarized fields, it is convenient to write (81) in terms of the\ni\n\nintensity correlation function for complete polarization, i.e., ( = 1.\nIf we let C I denote the correlation function for complete polarization,\nthen\n\nC\nC 1\tIT\n<I>2 = <IT,2\t\n\n(83)\n\ni\nUsing the results in (80) through (83), we find\n1\nC 1T (r l ,r 2 ,t 1 ,t 2 )\n\n= 2 (1 +\n\np2 ) C I (r l ,r 2 ,t l ,t 2 )\t\n\n(84)\n\nI\nWhen the field is completely depolarized, p = 0 in (84) and the intensity\nvariance is decreased by a factor of two. This is expected because in\nthis case the receiver is actually adding two independent speckle patterns.\nThe analysis in Section III can now be used to calculate the statistics\nof the receiver output by simply replacing the intensity covariance\nfunction by C I and the mean intensity by <I T >. The final results show that\nT\nthe mean value of the detected signal is increased to account for the energy\nin the additional polarization component and tilt speckle noise power is multiplied by\n\n2\n\n(1 + pt )\n\nto account for averaging of the speckle patterns in the\n\ntwo components.\n29\n\n\t\n\nVII. ATMOSPHERIC TURBULENCE\n\nAtmospheric turbulence affects a propagating laser beam by introducing\nrandom amplitude and phase fluctuations. This results in a reduction of the\nspatial and temporal coherence of the beam. Very little work has been\nreported on the interaction of turbulence and speckle.\n\n9,10\n\ninteresting results were derived in the paper by Lee et al.\n\nHowever, some\n\n10\n\nwhich can be\n\napplied to the satellite-based lidar problem.\nLee et al. assumed that phase perturbation of the laser beam is the\ndominant effect due to atmospheric turbulence. In addition they assumed\nthat the field statistics at the receiver are jointly Gaussian. Utilizing\nthese assumptions, the intensity covariance function of the field in the\nobservation plane was derived for collimated and focused beams. The\nresults are\n\n2\t\n5/3,\nC l (p) = oI exp- p - 4(-L-)I(focused)\t\n2\nL\t\n\n2R\t\n\n0\n\nT\t\n\n(85)\n\n_^\n\nand\n\n( kRl. 2\n\t\np 5/3\t\n2\t\nl r l 2\n-/ + T\t\n- 2\t\nC I (p) = o I exp \' -4( /\nP O f\t\t\nR TJ\n\nF`\t\n\n(call imated)\t\n\n(86)\n\nwhere o I is the intensity variance and\n\n-3 5\t\nPO = (0.546C2zk )\n\nP 0 is the phase correlation length and C2 is the turbulence structure\nparameter.\nThe results in Eqs. (85) through (87) apply to the case where the\ninitial beam profile at the transmitter is Gaussian and the transmitter,\nreceiver and tar;;et are all immersed in homogeneous turbulence.\n\n30\n\n(87)\n\nAlthough this does not apply to the geometry of the satellite-based lidar\nwhere only the target may be immersed in turbulence, the results can give\nsome insight into the satellite problem.\nFor no turbulence C\n\n= 0 and p 0\n\n= 00\n\nso that (85) and (86) reduce,\n\nas expected, to the cases considered in the previous sections. For strong\nturbulence, the intensity correlation length is given by either p 0 or R\nfor the focused case and by either p 0 , RT or _L z for the collimated case.\nT\nIn strong turbulence p 0 could be small enough so that it determines the\nspeckle scale size.\nPhysically, the effect can be explained by noting that turbulence\nreduces the beam coherence as it propagates to the target. Consequently,\nthe beam spreads out, illuminating an area larger than the diffraction\nlimited spot size. As the reflected field propagates back to the receiver,\nit is again perturbed by the turbulence, further increasing the effective\nsize of the illuminated target. The end result is a reduction in the\neffective speckle scale size which is inversely proportional to the size\nof the illuminated target.\nSimilar effects will occur over the satellite-earth propagation path.\np 0 will be different from the value given in (87) because the turbulence\nstructure parameter C 2 is a function of altitude and the turbulence is\nn\nconcentrated near the target. For high-altitude targets such as clouds,\nturbulence effects may be minimal since C n is significant only near the\nground.\nTurbulence will also affect the temporal statistics by reducing the\ntemporal coherence of the received signal. Because turbulence coherence\ntimes are relatively long (,, ms), these effects are probably negligible\ncompared to the effects of particle motion and transmitter pulse length.\n31\n\nf\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nL\n\nVIII. SUMMARY\n\nIn the previous sections the statistics of the signal and noise at the\noutput of a satellite-based lidar receiver were evaluated. These statistics\nare summarized in Tables I and II for the case where all the system functions\nare Gaussian. The mean signal, E(s), may be regarded as the average number\nof signal photons detected in a time interval of width 1/B when the receiver\nFOV is equal to the transmitter divergence angle 8 T . Similarly, E(n d2 ) is\nthe average number of background noise photons detected in a time interval\nof width 1/13 when the receiver FOV is equal to the diffraction limited\nvalue of a/R. The signal variance, Var(s), and background noise variance,\nVar(n), consist of a shot noise component and a speckle noise. The speckle\nnoise power is a function of the lidar system parameters and the characteristics of the scattering medium.\nA useful parameter for measuring the relative quality of lidar data\nis the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) which is defined as\n\nE(s)2\t\nSNR = Var(s) + Var(n) \t\n\n88\n\n( )\n\nUnder strong signal conditions the signal speckle noise dominates and the\nSNR becomes\n\n2MsM\n\nSNR \xe2\x80\x94\n(1+P-)\n\n(89)\n\nIt is instructive to evaluate (89) for some typical lidar parameters.\nI\n"\t\n\nAs an example we will use the system specification for the proposed cloud\nclimatology experiment (Advanced Applications Flight Experiment, GSFC).\n\n32\n\nTABLE 1.\n\nE[s(t) + n(t)] = E(s) + E(n d\n\nVar [s(t) + n(t)] = E(s )\nv\t\n\nd\n\n+ 1\t (1 + P2)\n2\n\n+ E(n dQ ) (RO T 2\n\nReT 2\nX\n\nE(s)\n\n2\n\nM M\ns T\n\n+ E(n dD. )2\n\nA )\t\n\nNsNT\t\n\nRe T 4\nX\n\ns(t) - signal voltage at receiver output\nn(t) - background noise voltage at receiver output\nndt - equivalent noise voltage for diffraction limited FOV\nR - receiver aperture radius\na - transmitter divergence angle and receiver FOV\nX - optical wavelength\nP - degree of signal polarization. 0 < P < 1\nM s - effective number of spatial correlation cells seen by\nreceiver aperture (signal)\nP1 - effective number of temporal correlation cells seen by\nreceiver electrical filter (signal)\nN s - effective number of spatial correlation cells seen by\nreceiver aperture (background noise)\nN T - effective number of\t temporal correlation cells seen by\nreceiver electrical filter (background noise)\n\n33\n\n-i\n\nL\n\nV\n\nf\n\n^\'\n\n..\n\nc\n\n1\t\n\nN\n\nN>\n\nm\n\n^ 1\nN F\n\n\'}\nN\nv\ncc\n\nN\n+\n\nu\n\nN\nc\n\n:J\n\nN F\n\ny\n\nN\n\nN \xe2\x80\x94 N\n00\t\n00\n\n>\nN\n\ntC\n\nN\n+\nN\t\nN r\n\nN\n\n7_J\n\n""\n\nN\t\n\nFI\n\n<O\n\nN\n\nra\n\n^\n_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa27\n\nN F\n\n1 ^1\n.\n^7\n\nV\ny\n\n+\n\nI\t ^\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nN\n\nN\n\n.\n\nQ!\nE\n\n.0\n\nO\n\nm\nN\n\nr\n\nG\nrJ\nu\n\nU\n\n7\ny\nI\ny\n\nY\ny\n\n1\n\nV\n7\n\nO\n\nd\n\nd\n\nv\n\n.r\n\nC\n\nv\n\n3\n\nL\n\nO\n\nY\n\ny\n\nc\ncC\n\nM\n\ny\n\nU\n\nL\n\na\n\n-^\n\nG\nQI\nL\n\n+\nN\nf\xe2\x80\xa2!\n\nOCi\n\nV\n\n+\nC.4\nrd\n~ N\n+\n\nN\nN\np\n\nC\n\nG\n\n+\n\nx\n\nY\n\n\',C\n\n^7\t\n\nr\nVI\n\nL\n\nL L\n\nY\n\nf\nY\n\ny\nv\nu\n\n3\'.\n\nL\n\n4\n\nY\n\nL\nL\n.9\n\n3\n\'O\nC\n.O\nN\nY\nu\n\nQl\n\nw\n\nu\nG\nv\n\nL\n\nv\n\nd\nW\nu\n\nc\n\n0!\n\nY\n\nV\n\nv\n\n>\n\nV\n\nI\n\nN\nu\n\n17\n\nv\n\nY\ny\nN\n\n0\n.y\n\nu\n\nw\n\nU\n\nih\n\nd\n7\n\nU\n\nw\n\nORIGINAL\nPA GE;\nOF POOR @UA [S\nI,11y\n\nb\n\n3\n\nT\nG\nr,\nV\n\nL\n\n-^\n\nW\n\nY\n\n3\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2^\n\nv u\n.yi\t\nN\n^ u\nY\t\n\nd\n\nu\n\n...1\n\ne >\ny\t\n_\t\n\nL\n\nY\nU\n.^\t\n\n5\n\n1\nL to\n\n1\t\nN\n\nI\n\n\t\n\nReceiver\n\nLaser\n\nR - 9 cm\n\nX - 1.06 um, 0.532 um\nt p - 5 ns (FWHM)\nT\t\n\nB- 100 MHz\n\n_m\n\nV -\n\nsc\n\nti\n\n10 km/sec\n\n0 - 0.5 mrad 10 dB\n(Half-angle\n\ni\n\npoints)\n\nUsing the above values in (89) we obtain\n\n3.6 x 10 3\ta\n\n= 1.06 um\n\nbNR\n1.45 x 10 4\tA = 0.532 um\n\nThese relatively high SNRs are a consequence of large transmitter\ndivergence angle.
