They are extensively used in fluid mechanics, porous media flow, meteorology, electromagnetics, models of biological processes, semi-conductor device simulation and many other engineering areas governed by conservative systems that can be written in integral control volume form. This article reviews elements of the foundation and analysis of modern finite volume methods. The primary advantages of these methods are numerical robustness through the obtention of discrete maximum (minimum) principles, applicability on very general unstructured meshes, and the intrinsic local conservation properties of the resulting schemes. Throughout this article, specific attention is given to scalar nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws and the development of high order accurate schemes for discretizing them. A key tool in the design and analysis of finite volume schemes suitable for non-oscillatory discontinuity capturing is discrete maximum principle analysis. A number of building blocks used in the development of numerical schemes possessing local discrete maximum principles are reviewed in one and several space dimensions, e.g. monotone fluxes, E-fluxes, TVD discretization, non-oscillatory reconstruction, slope limiters, positive coefficient schemes, etc. When available, theoretical results concerning a priori and a posteriori error estimates are given. Further advanced topics are then considered such as high order time integration, discretization of diffusion terms and the extension to systems of nonlinear conservation laws.", "title": "Finite Volume Methods: Foundation and Analysis", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T11:45:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20030020790, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Barth, Timothy"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "f2a8cd41fc0448df96f61905d8f586e7"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20030020790, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ohlberger, Mario"}, "organization": {"name": "Freiburg Univ.", "location": "Germany"}}, "id": "289e337b714a4ec5a4d31ed6e4a5de4b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030020790, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030020790, "id": "e99a2784968c4267939ec93efd484c74", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030020790.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030020790/downloads/20030020790.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030020790/downloads/20030020790.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030020790/downloads/20030020790.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
