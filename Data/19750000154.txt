Voltage\nvariations above or below the required levels\nfrequently cause the loss of data or the storage of false\ninformation. Once this happens, it takes a long time\nto determine what caused the discrepancy in the data.\nConventional monitoring equipment, which records\nthe supply voltage variations, is expensive and\nrelatively complex. Normally it is installed on location\nwith the system that it monitors.\nThe solution:\nA relatively-simple voltage monitoring system has\nbeen developed. The system serves as a central station\nwhich can monitor voltage variations through\ntransmission lines connected to equipment scattered\nin different locations.\n\nHow it's done:\nThe system incorporates power interface circuits\nwhich are coupled to the bus bars of the monitored\nequipment. These interface circuits reduce the\nrecorded voltages to a level suitable for transmission\nover conventional telephone lines to a centrallylocated control station. The station is equipped with\ninstruments which record only the voltage levels that\nare above or below the specified value.\nAs shown in the system block diagram, the\ntelephone transmission lines from the power interface\ncircuits are connected to the terminal strip at the\ncentral station. The strip drives an amplifier which\nhas a pair of outputs. One output is fed to a voltagecontrolled oscillator (VCO) and the other to a trigger\ncircuit.\nThe voltage-controlled oscillator is optional. It is\nused in some systems to condition the signal to make\nit compatible with certain types of oscillographs.

The\noscillograph is designed to operate at a relatively high\nspeed to produce a high-resolution graph of the\nmonitored voltage.\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed\nto:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nKennedy Space Center\nCode AD-PAT\nKennedy Space Center, Florida 32899\nReference: TSP75-10154\n\nPatent status:\nThis invention has been patented by NASA (U.S.\nPatent No. 3,869,667).
