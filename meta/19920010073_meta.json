A survey of KATE's developer/modelers revealed that they were already using a sophisticated set of productivity enhancing tools. They did request five more, however, and those make up the body of the information presented here: (1) a transfer function code fitter; (2) a FORTRAN-Lisp translator; (3) three existing structural consistency checkers to aid in syntax checking their modeled device frames; (4) an automated procedure for calibrating knowledge base admittances to protect KATE's hardware mockups from inadvertent hand valve twiddling; and (5) three alternatives for the 'pseudo object', a programming patch that currently apprises KATE's modeling devices of their operational environments.", "title": "Kate's Model Verification Tools", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:09:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920010073, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Morgan, Steve"}, "organization": {"name": "Baylor Univ.", "location": "Waco, TX, United States"}}, "id": "33b6a0635b5f4d17bda3c02cd0ed7ac3"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-09-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920010073, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920010073, "id": "639c3f7816a74a1da192c4ae4f4fdbe4", "publicationName": "University of Central Florida, NASA(ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program. 1991 Research Reports", "publicationDate": "1991-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920010073.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920010073/downloads/19920010073.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920010073/downloads/19920010073.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920010073/downloads/19920010073.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
