A relatively new approach has been the launching of\nsatellites into heterogeneous constellations. The first significant earth observing constellation began with\nthe launch of USGS\xe2\x80\x99s Landsat-7 and NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellites in 1999 into\na 705 kilometer altitude sun-synchronous orbit. These were joined the following year by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Earth\nObserving-1 (EO-1) satellite and Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s CONAE satellite, SAC-C, resulting in a full-fledged\norbiting constellation. All 4 missions cross the equator within minutes of each other at the mean local\ntime (MLT) range of 10:00 a.m. - 10:30 a.m. Hence, the group is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cMorning Constellation\xe2\x80\x9d.\nIn 2002, a second constellation began forming with the launch of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s EOS Aqua satellite,\nfollowed 2 years later by EOS Aura. The two missions also fly in 705 kilometer altitude sun-synchronous\norbits like the Morning Constellation, but cross the equator at an MLT range of about 1:30 p.m. \xe2\x80\x93 2:00\np.m. so this constellation is known as the \xe2\x80\x9cAfternoon Constellation\xe2\x80\x9d. The science community refers to it\nby its more popular name, the \xe2\x80\x9cA-Train\xe2\x80\x9d. A third satellite, PARASOL, managed by the French Space\nAgency, CNES, joined the A-Train in 2004, followed by CALIPSO (a joint U.S./French mission) and\nCloudSat (a joint NASA/Colorado State University/U. S. Air Force mission) in 2006. Two more NASA\nmissions are to be introduced into the A-Train in 2009, Glory and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory\n(OCO), bringing the total to 7 satellites and 16 instruments that will be providing near-coincident science\ndata.\nConstellations provide the scientists a capability to acquire science data, not only from specific\ninstruments on a single satellite, but also from instruments on other satellites that fly in the same orbit.\nInitial results from the A-Train (especially following the CALIPSO/CloudSat launch) attest to the\ntremendous scientific value of constellation flying.\nThis paper provides a history of the constellations (particularly the A-Train) and how the A-Train\nmission design was driven by science requirements. The A-Train has presented operational challenges\nwhich had not previously been encountered. Operations planning had to address not only how the\n\nsatellites of each constellation operate safely together, but also how the two constellations fly in the same\norbits without interfering with each other when commands are uplinked or data are downlinked to their\nrespective ground stations.\nThis paper discusses the benefits of joining an on-orbit constellation. When compared to a single,\nlarge satellite, a constellation infrastructure offers more than just the opportunities for coincidental\nscience observations. For example, constellations reduce risks by distributing observing instruments\namong numerous satellites; in contrast, a failed launch or a system failure in a single satellite would lead\nto loss of all observations. Constellations allow for more focused, less complex satellites. Constellations\ndistribute the development, testing, and operations costs among various agencies and organizations \xe2\x80\x93 for\nexample, the Morning and Afternoon Constellations involve several agencies within the U.S. and in other\ncountries.\nLastly, this paper addresses the need to plan for the long-term evolution of a constellation. Agencies\nneed to have a replenishment strategy as some satellites age and eventually leave the constellation. This\nwill ensure overlap of observations, thus providing continuous, calibrated science data over a much longer\ntime period. Thoughts on the evolution of the A-Train will also be presented.\n\n'
