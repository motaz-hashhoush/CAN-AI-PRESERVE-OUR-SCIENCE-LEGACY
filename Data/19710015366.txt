For optimum performance characteristics, it is\npreferable that the resonant frequency of the slot and\ndipole be within approximately 2.5% of each other.\nIn thc preferled form of the invention, the lengths EH\na r J GJ ~~teicepted the feeders I l c , Bld and I l e , 111\nby\nxes@ectivelyplus the sum of the lengths of the feeder\nelenenls themselves is equal to approximately one wave\nI-~igth.\nIn the way of example, an antenna having the con-\n\n20\n\n2.5\n\n30\n\n::3\n\n40\n\n4j\n\n55\n\n60\n\n05\n\n70\n\n75\n\n4\nstruction illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 was built with the\ndipoles of elements 11 and 12 designed to be resonant at\n330 mRz., the slots S designed to be resonant at 440\nmHz., the two ha sing lines being 300 ohm lines with one\nline being resonant at 320 mHz. and the other being\nresonant at 360 mPk. In this test model, the voItage\nstanding wave ratio (VSWR) was less than 2:l across\nthe entire range from 225 to 380 mHz. and the resultant\ncharacteristic impedance of the transmission line 13 was\napproximately 150 ohms. The antenna covered a frequency range of 1.7 to 1 for a VSWR of less than 2: 1\nwithout the use of special matching devices. 71he gain of\nthe antenna wfer an isotropic source was found to be\nequivalent to or slightly g~eaterthan that of a conventional turnstila antenna and circular polarization was\nachieved over a 1.3 to 1 frequency range.\nFIG. 5 o l the drawings illustrates the antenna element\nof the present invention employed in a highly directive\narray. Two driven antenna elements 111 and 112 which\nare rotated 90" with respect to each other are illustrated\nin coaxial alignment with two parasitic arrays of directors and reflectors indicated generally at 113 and 114,\nwith the driven antenna elements 111 and 112 being\naxially spaced from the two parasitic arrays 113 and 114.\nThe parasitic elements in each array may be formed of\nfour crossed, connected dipoles having the illustrated\nconfiguration. The driven elements 111 and 112 have\nthe same form as illustrated in FIG. 3. By means of the\ni!lustrated antenna construction, a highly directional signal of the type required for space communications and\ntracking may be obtained. It wiil also be understood that\nother configurations may also be employed with the antcnna element of the present invention for achieving a\ndirective or an omnidirectional array. Thus, by way of\nexample rather than limitation, a conical horn reflector\nor pa~abolicdish reflector located approximately a quarter-wave length behind the driven antenna elements\ncould be employed for producing a highly directive array.\nWhere omnidirectional coverage is desired, two antenna\nelements such as the element illustrated in FIG. 3 may be\nspaced a full wave length apart, fed in parallel and\nmounted on a vertical mast in either the vertical or\nhorizontal plane.\nWith reference to FIG. 6, a modified form of the\ninvention is illustrated for prodacing omnidirectional\ncoverage in the horizontal plane. In the form of the invention illustrated in FIG. 6, two sets of antenna elements\n211, 212 and 214, 215 are horizontally mounted on a\nvertical mast M\' and are interconnected by one or more\ntransmission lines 213 of approximately one wavelength.\nThe two antenna elements in each set are rotated 90"\nwith respect to each other in the manner previously described with reference to FIG. 1. It should be noted that\nif desired, more than two antenna elements of the PreSent invention may be included in any groupWhile the antenna of the present invention has been\ndescribed as having rod-like dipoles and feeders, it will\nbe understood that the antenna elements may be formed\nby printcd circuit technique or may take on any other\nphysical configuration which provides the desired results.\nThe foregoing disclosure and description of the invention is illustrative and explanatory thereof, and various\nchanges in the size, shape and materials as well as in the\ndetails of the illustrated construction may be made within the scope of the appended claims without departing\nfrom the spirit of the invention.\nI claim:\n1.
