I recall Alan\nShepard being at the Naval Academy in spring 1971 after he\nwalked on the Moon. That was a special moment for me because\nI have always been interested in aviation. My dad was a Navy\nflier in World War II. My grandfather flew biplanes in France in\nWorld War I. It had long been one of my ambitions to be a naval\naviator, but I found out shortly before that day in 1971 that I\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t have the eyesight to be a pilot. So I ended up being a Navy\ndiver, a SEAL. I was sitting there listening to Al Shepard talk\nabout his adventures on the Moon, and I was thinking I probably would never have to worry about doing anything like that.\nHow strange events have turned.\nI bring that up because I enjoy talking to kids and making\neducation a very relevant part of space exploration. I think we\noften forget what impact exploration, technology, and human\nspaceflight have on the young kids of this country.\nA little more personal history: I served in the Navy for thirteen\nyears, was selected in 1984 to go to Houston and to start training\nas an astronaut. I flew three times on the Shuttle. They were very\ninteresting flights. The longest flight I had was ten days. Right\nafter that, I was asked to go to Washington for two weeks and\nhelp as the Administration had changed in 1992. In early 1993,\nthere was a complete review of the Space Station program. We\nwere in the middle of trying to decide whether Space Station\nFreedom would continue as a program or be canceled or be\ntransformed into something else. So I had a lot of time in\nWashington working on how we would convert Freedom into\nsomething that was more feasible. At the end of that period, we\n\n205\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 206\n\nLooking Backward, Looking Forward\n\ngot the Russians involved, which seemed politically to be a really\ngood idea. One thing led to another, and, in 1995, I was asked to\ngo to Russia and start training with another Russian cosmonaut,\nSergei Krikalev, to be on the first human crew to the ISS.\nSo in early 1996, I started training in Russia and basically\nspent almost five years with Sergei and another Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gidzenko, who is a colonel and a fighter pilot in the\nRussian Air Force. We trained, and, finally after four or five\nmajor delays, lots of slips and slides, we launched last October\n[2000] and flew what was called the first expedition to the ISS.\nWe launched from Baikonur on very much the same rocket\nthat put Yuri Gagarin into space, pretty much an R-7 Russian\nbooster. I was very impressed with the ride. It was very much like\nthe Space Shuttle, very smooth. We lived on the International\nSpace Station for 141 days. At the end of that period in March,\nthe second expedition crew took over. A Russian and two\nAmerican astronauts are up there now, Yuri Usachev, Susan\nVoss, and Jim Helms, and flying on the Space Station as we\nspeak. So it was a real privilege to lead the charge, making the\nISS a reality.\nWhat I really want to talk about is not so much what we\ndid, but what it all means. As the station is taking shape in orbit\nnow, I think it might be easier to see not only what the issues\nwere on its past development, but some of its future purpose.\nTo start off, it might be interesting to consider what differences and even similarities there would be between ISS as it is\nflying right now and a human expedition to Mars. So I\xe2\x80\x99d like to\ntouch on some of the ISS program lessons that are applicable. I think\n\n206\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 207\n\nPreparing for New\nChallenges\xe2\x80\x94William Shepherd\n\nthat a human expedition to Mars is going to be characterized by\nseveral broad themes.\nFirst, it is going to be international. I do not believe that any\nsingle country has the financial resources, the technical know-how,\nor even the political will to carry out a large and costly exploration\nprogram to Mars or even back to the Moon. I think anything that\nwe do in the future will be broad in scope and will be international\nin character, much as the partnership that\xe2\x80\x99s been formed to build and\nfly the station right now. The station partnership is certainly not perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of bumps on it, and we have had many tough\ntimes with our partners. Even today we\xe2\x80\x99re doing a lot of arguing,\nbut the job is getting done, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a model for how we might\ndo things in the future. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a perfect one, but it is functional.\nSecondly, an expedition to Mars will be characterized by\nthings that are big and heavy. I think that the vehicle that flies to\nMars will be at least the size of the ISS and probably several\ntimes bigger. We need this because we have to have something\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s very robust and self-sufficient. I think the crafts that we\nwill see going to Mars are going to be too big to be put up by\nthe current stock of expendable boosters or by the Space Shuttle.\nThis is because we cannot afford to have a vehicle or a fleet of\nvehicles that are assembled in orbit that take thirty or forty\nlaunches. We have got to do this in a way that involves less risk\nand allows us to have better test and checkout on the ground as\nthese large pieces are sent up into space so that the verification\nand integration job in orbit is not as large.\nSo risk, time, expense, and these checkout requirements are\nall going to favor putting large spacecraft on very large boosters\n\n207\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 208\n\nLooking Backward, Looking Forward\n\nand trying to get them into low-Earth orbit with a minimum\nnumber of launches. It is clear that we do not have that capability\ntoday. The expedition to Mars, regardless of how cleverly we\ndesign things, will be made up of a vehicle or a fleet of vehicles\nthat will be assembled in orbit. Regardless of the technologies\nthat we use, the vehicle that we would send to Mars would be\nvery complex and will require the spacewalking and the robotics\ntechniques that we\xe2\x80\x99re developing and proving right now on the\nISS. There just is not any way to get some of the larger systems,\nparticularly things like thermal systems or solar panel systems,\ncompletely checked out on the ground. We have to be able to\nassemble and perform such checkout procedures in orbit.\nThird, expeditions to Mars also are going to need more\npower. We probably will not put humans on Mars transfer-trajectory using the energy for propulsion that would come from\nchemical sources. I am not sure that we will even be able to satisfy the ship\xe2\x80\x99s own energy needs with solar power or chemical\nreactions. Once we get to a place where we want to go, whether\nit is the Moon or Mars, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do mining, in situ\nexploration of resources, efficient recovery, or manufacturing\nwithout large amounts of energy. We will need [not] only energy,\nbut high power levels. To me, all these things say that the\nenabling technology to make this happen is going to involve\nsome form of nuclear power.\nMissions to Mars are going to need more speed. We need to\ncut down the transfer times to get humans and cargo to Mars and\nback. In order to do this, we have got to find propulsion schemes\nthat are more efficient than the chemical rockets that we have now.\n\n208\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 209\n\nPreparing for New\nChallenges\xe2\x80\x94William Shepherd\n\nWe are going to look for these types of engines that have to have\nboth high thrust and high efficiency or high specific impulse.\nFourth, vehicles that go to Mars will be different from the\nvehicles that we fly today in space, because they will need to be\nhighly autonomous. A Mars mission is going to have significant\ncommunications delays. Additionally, the trajectories to send\nvehicles to Mars do not lend themselves readily to good abort\ntrajectories where we can get humans home quickly.\nWhat this means is the crew onboard is going to have to\nmanage and control what they are doing with not a lot of realtime help from the folks on the ground. It also means that the\nvehicles that we build are going to have to be survivable. We\ncannot put Soyuz capsules on this kind of vehicle and expect\nthem to be able to get people home. We have to build spacecraft\nmore like we build ships, where they can sustain some kind of\ndamage from combat or some other catastrophe and still carry\non. We cannot depend on mission control in either Houston or\nMoscow to keep turning things on and off all day on the station,\nbecause the awareness of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground is\ngoing to be 20, 30, 40 minutes behind what\xe2\x80\x99s really happening\nin space. All these factors indicate that the manner in which we\nare not only going to design but operate these vehicles is going\nto be quite different than what we are doing right now.\nThe last thing that I think is going to characterize a mission\nis that the environmental systems are going to look a lot like\nwhat you have on Space Station now. The Russians have done a\npretty good job of closing off some of the environmental loops\non their Zvezda module. Their equipment works very well and\n\n209\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 210\n\nLooking Backward, Looking Forward\n\nis very robust. It is a pretty well thought-out system. I think for\nmissions up to six months, certainly a year, the kind of environment\nthat we have right now on the ISS is a livable and workable place\nfor humans.\nIf you include the other factors that I mentioned in trying\nto go to Mars and do exploration there, I think it starts to be\nwithin the grasp of what we could reasonably expect humans to\nbe able to do. There are probably a lot of other questions to consider\nin relation to a human Mars exploration program, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll give\nyou just some of the ones that I think about at night.\nThe big one would be: What should the structure of a large\ninternational partnership for exploration be? How will it be controlled? How will it be managed? I think the issues that we have\nhad recently with the Russians as partners in the ISS of flying\nMr. Tito show that we have not worked out all the bugs in the\npresent International Space Station partnership about what partners\nare entitled to and how decisions are to be arrived at by consensus.\nWe will have to get better at doing this.\nAnother question is how will high-energy density power\nplants and propulsors with high efficiency be developed? How\nwill they be tested? Can we do this on orbit? How will a robust,\nreliable, maintainable, yet survivable spacecraft be designed,\nknowing that it diverges significantly from how we design here\nright now for work in space? How will the necessary political\nwill be mobilized to carry out such a program?\nOne of my favorite questions relates not to technology per se,\nbut to culture. Are we open to the necessary changes in our technical\nculture here in the United States, here at NASA, here in the ISS\n\n210\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 211\n\nPreparing for New\nChallenges\xe2\x80\x94William Shepherd\n\nprogram, that will enable these other questions to be answered\nand these changes to be made? It is not just a question of adaptation at NASA or in the U.S. partnership for ISS, it\xe2\x80\x99s all the partners. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Russians, the Canadians, the Japanese, all the\nmembers of European Union, the Brazilians, and so forth. We\nhave to do a much better job of trying to duplicate some of the\nefforts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to standardize\nmilitary systems. We need standardized interfaces, components,\nand designs for space systems. We don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a coordinate\nsystem that everybody agrees upon as to how to lay a vehicle out\nand design it for space. We have a Russian system and a U.S. one,\nbut we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a standard system.\nWe do not even have a standard vocabulary, let alone a\nstandard understanding of even how we do the mathematics, the\ncomputer algorithms, the intricate computations that are necessary to guide vehicles through space. We think we understand\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s approach, speaking about the U.S. vis-\xc3\xa0-vis Russia,\nbut we have not converged on what we consider to be the optimal procedures. So I think something along the lines of the\nNATO experience is essential as a precursor to getting this\nexploration program done.\nThere are also some important issues regarding political\nwill. I think the day is coming soon when people will be very\ninterested to understand why the Space Station costs what it\ndoes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the question about Space Station or space\nexploration is really one of cost, but rather of value. People need\nto see a good return on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve invested in space. They need\nto see that there is value present in what we are doing.\n\n211\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 212\n\nLooking Backward, Looking Forward\n\nThe ISS is hopefully going to do that in spades when we get\nmore capability in orbit with our laboratories. But already you\ncan see that commercialization of space is going to be a fundamental imperative. I think NASA is going to have to work hard\nsoon at showing that the ISS has very strong commercial value.\nI believe also that the role for astronauts, government\nastronauts, folks at NASA, my colleagues, is not really to do routine operations in low-Earth orbit anyway. We are the folks who\nneed to go build the infrastructure. NASA should make plans to get\nout of the routine operation business in low-Earth orbit. We\nshould let the marketplace drive that. As was the case in our own\ncountry with opening the West and laying rails coast to coast, the\ngovernment helped facilitate putting down the infrastructure,\nand we let commerce proceed. I think space exploration will take\nplace the same way. NASA needs to be the risk takers or the underwriters, and, once that era is over, we need to let commercialization proceed. Our business at NASA should be exploration.\nSo what are the problems? We\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed many ideas. Some\nare well within reach of solution, while others are not. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\ntalked about commercialization. No one really knows well yet\nhow to do it with the ISS, although we\xe2\x80\x99re heading in that direction.\nWe have talked about standards and the need for stronger\nones, discussing how we merge all these partner nations into a\njoint international enterprise. I contend that we have done a particularly poor job of capturing the design philosophy. Why is the\nISS or the Space Shuttle, or any rocket for that matter, built in its\nown specific way? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t we put this filter over here? Why\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t we pick another type of fan to put in here? Why are the\n\n212\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 213\n\nPreparing for New\nChallenges\xe2\x80\x94William Shepherd\n\nfuel lines or the fuel tanks for the rocket shaped in a particular\nway or made out of any kind of material? These aspects of development reside within U.S. contractors, but we are very poor at\ngrasping the essence of why these decisions were made and cataloging them so people who come behind who have to do this\njob again can learn from these developments.\nWe talked a lot about having autonomous systems. We need\nto develop some type of pilot advocate, a high-level computer system\nthat can logically run complex systems. But before that, probably\nthe first step that we need to undertake is to decide on a common\nlanguage, a common computer application, that will enable us to\nmodel complex systems to provide the necessary data for the human\ninterfaces and displays, and to build and drive those displays.\nWe need to work on higher energy systems and nuclear\npower. I was over in Russia in 1995 at the Institute of Thermal\nProcesses, where Sergei Korolev worked in the 1930s. We were\nover there looking at possibly adding a solar dynamic generator\nto the ISS. It was going to be a carbon block through which a gas\nflow led to a turban, and the carbon block was heated by a big\nparabolic reflector. The Russian engineers had a big chart on the\nwall, showing that this was going to be about a 10-kilowatt system with an exponential development growth. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cCan you\nguys say what the heat source is going to be for this system?\xe2\x80\x9d\nThey said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be nuclear.\xe2\x80\x9d So I think\nthe technical ability to do this is certainly right around the corner,\nand the Russians clearly have been thinking about this as well.\nWe also need to figure out how to energize a plasma by creating\nsome type of electric-propulsion device that can both push very\n\n213\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 214\n\nLooking Backward, Looking Forward\n\nhard on an object with high thrust and also have very high\nexhaust velocity so it is very efficient. We are working on these\ntypes of technologies right as we speak in Houston at the\nJohnson Space Center. It is very possible that before too many\nyears are out, this technology will be utilized to alleviate the ISS\xe2\x80\x99s\ndrag. The ISS has a drag on it of only a couple of ounces, but this\ncauses it to come down a couple hundred yards every day in its\norbital decay. A highly efficient propulsion source could oppose\nthat drag with a small amount of continuous thrust. This would\nkeep the ISS from falling out of the sky and would significantly\nreduce our need to fly fuel up to re-boost it. This is important\nbecause when the ISS is fully assembled and weighs on the order\nof 500 tons, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to fly something on the order of 10 tons\nof propellant up to it every year to re-boost it. With a system\nsuch as this, that goes down by a factor of ten. We could have\naround a ton of hydrogen gas, but xenon might be a better gas\nthat can be used in this plasma engine to propel the station and\nsolve this re-boost requirement. This is a direct precursor of the\nkind of technology that will be useful to push crew transport\nvehicles to Mars.\nThere are a lot of other questions that have to be answered.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go after closed life support. The Russians are working hard on this. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got twenty years of experience base on\nMir, and what they\xe2\x80\x99ve put on the ISS right now is doing a good\njob of partially closing some of the gas and water loops. But we\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t totally solved such problems.\nI think the biggest single issue in addressing any of the\nproblems that I have mentioned is we do not have a way to mar-\n\n214\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 215\n\nPreparing for New\nChallenges\xe2\x80\x94William Shepherd\n\nshal the adequate academic and intellectual resources in this\ncountry to solve these problems. So I would suggest that the\ncountry take a look at some of the national educational institutes\nthat we have in the military. There are eight or nine of them\xe2\x80\x94\nThe National War College, Industrial College of the Armed\nServices, and so forth.\nWe need to have a National Space Institute that has some\nkind of Federal Charter. Its purpose would be to make available\nthe intellectual resources necessary for the human exploration of\nspace. It would have this as a single purpose. It would be a place\nwhere the appropriate knowledge, the experience, and the intellectual energy could be focused on this single goal. It would have\nthe status of other national colleges. It would also be a virtual\ncollege or a university, and it would be collaborative with colleges and universities and other learning institutions all across\nthe country and perhaps the world. Experts on space from\nalmost any corridor could participate and contribute to what\nthis institute would do.\nIt also would have very strong business participation. We\nwould have folks from industry come to this environment, learn,\ngo back and work, and then come back and teach. It would be\na means for individuals to become more proficient in the technical\nengineering operations, as well as the business and political\naspects of space exploration. Such a national space institute also\nwould need to establish and maintain close contact with ongoing\ndevelopment and operations in human space programs. Now\nthis needs not to be some intellectual outpost well away from what\xe2\x80\x99s\nhappening, but rather needs to be in the center of the mix. I think\n\n215\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 216\n\nLooking Backward, Looking Forward\n\nthis would probably be the most direct way to address the many\ntechnical, political, and cultural problems that I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned.\nIn closing, my experience in space has led me to believe\nmost strongly that all these issues can be addressed successfully.\nSure, there are problems, but I think we are well on our way to\nfinding the necessary answers, at least to enable human exploration back to the Moon and probably to Mars. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a question\nof marshalling the intellect and the will to go do it.\nShould we have a clear policy at a national level to go\nmake this happen? It is certainly something that can be carried\nout by the people who are in the field right now.\nOne hundred and forty-one days in space. I came back\nfrom my tour on the ISS thinking that spending your day looking\nat the surface of Earth is very enjoyable, a paradise as Mr. Tito\nsays. Nevertheless, I really think that we should expand our\nvision by looking at the surface of other planets in this solar system.\nI am convinced that we have the means to do so.\n\n216\n\n'
