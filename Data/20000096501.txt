NASA issued a feasibility study\ncontract to evaluate the potential of a 5-segment\nbooster to improve the overall capability of the\nShuttle system, especially evaluating the potential to\nincrease the system reliability and safety. In order to\neffectively evaluate the feasibility of the 5-segment\nconcept, a four-member\ncontractor team was\nestablished under the direction of NASA Marshall\nSpace Hight Center (MSFC).\nMSFC provided the\noverall program oversight and integration as well as\n-\n\nHuntington Beach (BNA), Lockheed Martin\nMooched Space Systems (LMMSS) and United\n\nwas responsible for the overall integration\ncoordination\nof the contractor team across\n\ncomponent\n\ndesign\n\nmodifications.\n\nUtah\nThe basic objective of the Phase A study, was to\ndetermine the feasibility of a 5-segment booster\ndesign in achieving an increase to the overall Shuttle\nsystem safety, and reliability.\nInitially in the study the\nprimary. Shuttle systems safety improvement\nwas to\neliminate the return to launch site (RLS) abort mode\nby achieving transatlantic\n(TAL) abort off the pa& A\nsecondary objective was to increase the overall\nreliability of the booster itself. These objectives were\nto be met while minimizing\nimpacts of the FSB\ndesign on other Shuttle elements.\nThis included\nmaintaining the current booster interfaces with the\nexternal tank (ET) and mobile launch platform\n(MLP). It was also assumed that there would be no\nincrease in design loads and environments\non the\norbiter as a result of incorporating\nthe FSB into the\noverall Shuttle system. The basic design constraints\nimposed were to minimize changes to the current\nShuttle booster hardware and infrastructure\nand also\nincorporating\n\ninto the FSB any of the currently\n\nplanned Shuttle booster\nupgrades.\n\nof\n\nand\nall of the\n\nbooster elements. They were also responsible for all\nof the motor modification\nevaluations.\nBoeing North\nAmerican (BNA) was responsible for all systems\nintegration analyses, generation of loads and\nenvironments,\nand performance\nand abort mode\ncapabilities.\nLockheed Martin Michoud Space\nSystems (LMMSS) was responsible for evaluating\nthe impacts of any changes to the booster on the\nexternal tank (ET), and evaluating any design\nchanges on the external tank necessary to\naccommodate\nthe FSB. USA. including the former\nUSBI contingent, was responsible\nfor evaluating any\nmodifications\nto facilities at the launch site as well as\nany booster\n\nHuppi\nCity,\n\neffort to improve\nof the Shuttle\n\nSpace Alliance (USA) and their subcontractor\nbd\nSystems (Control Dynamics Division, Huntsville,\nAL).

This\nresulted in a booster that was 320 inches longer than\nthe current reusable solid rocket booster (RSRB).\nIn\norder to utilize the existing case metal hardware, a\nnew nozzle had to be included to accommodate\nthe\nincreased mass flow rate resulting from the added\nsegment (see Figures 2 and 3). This new nozzle\nincorporates\nmany of the features developed during\nthe Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) program.\nOne of the key changes is the elimination of the flex\nboot from the current Shuttle nozzle as a protection\nfor the movable bearing and incorporating\na flex\nbearing protector (see Figure 4). This flex bearing\nprotector is similar to the flexible bearing systems\nused on expendable\nrocket motors and will not be a\nreusable component\nin the 5-segment nozzle. The 5segment nozzle will also eliminate one internal joint\n\n\xc2\xa92000 Thiokol Propulsion a Division of Cordant Technologies.\nInc..

The\nparachute diameter had to be increased from 136 fl to\n140 ft. The basic parachute design and materials\nwere also changed to reflect those developed as part\nof the earlier Shuttle upgrade program. The new\n\nintegrated into the current Shuttle boosters.\nThis is\nallowed because of the inherent nature of designing\nand qualify a totally new nozzle for the 5-segment\nbooster.\nAs such, all of these features will make the\n5-segment booster nozzle somewhat more reliable\nthan the current Shuttle booster nozzle. These nozzle\nimprovements\nmore than compensate\nof the added field joints, thus making\nreliable than the current RSRB.\nIn order to enhance\n\nparachute materials also allowed the larger diameter\nparachute to be packaged in the same volume as the\ncurrent Shuttle booster parachutes.\n\nfor the addition\nthe FSB more\n\nthe overall performance\n\nBasic comparison\nof the performance\ncharacteristics\nof the current 4-segment Shuttle boosters and the\nproposed FSB is shown in Figure 6. Note that both\nsystems maintain the same maximum expected\noperating pressure (MEOP) to ensure utilization of\nexisting metal hardware. As previously mentioned\nthe nozzle throat diameter had to be increased to\n\nof the 5-\n\nsegment booster, the nozzle length and exit diameter\nwere increased consistent with what had been\npreviously qualified under the earlier Shuttle upgrade\nprogram. In order to meet the overall Shuttle system\nperformance\nconstraints, the thrust profile and\nconsequently\nthe internal grain geometry of the 5segment booster had to be modified.\nAdditionally,\nthe bum rate of the propellant was reduced from\n0.368 inch per second to 0.343 inch per second thus\nmaintaining the formulation and flight proven\nperformance\nheritage. The main graindesign feature\nchange was increasing the number of fins in the\nforward segment geometry from 11 to 13 (see Figure\n3).\nIn order to maintainthe same attach interface\nthe external\nthe external\n\nmaintain that pressure with the increased mass flow\nrate associated with the additional segment. This\nincrease in throat diameter resulted in a decreased\nexpansion ratio from 7.72 to 6.55, even with the\nincreased nozzle exit diameter for the FSB. This\nreduced expansion ratio resulted in a decrease in ISP\nof 3.3 seconds, however the increased propellant\nfrom the added segment had a substantial increase in\nthe system total impulse and maximum thrust. One\nof the key performance\nfeatures is the maintenance of\nthe initial thrust to weight with the FSB. This is\ncritical in ensuring a proper clearance of the booster\nas it lifts off from the MLP.

This Figure shows which abort modes\noptions are available at given times when a Space\nShuttle Main Engine (SSME) fails during ascent.\nFor example, with the current Shuttle boosters, a\nreturn to launch site abort (RTLS) can be achieved\nwith an SSME failing any time between lift off and\n230 seconds. Similarly, transatlantic\n(TAL) abort can\nbe be initiated in approximately\n120 seconds after\n\nforward segment with integral hooks and a thrust\nblock that holds the thrust attach bolt for integrating\nwith the external tank (see Figure 5). In order to\ndistribute the attach loads between the external tank\nand the booster,\n\nadditional\n\nstiffeners\n\ninto the surface of the forward\n\nare machined\n\nsegment.\n\nSince the interface between the external tank and the\nbooster is now accommodated\nwith the forward\nattach segment, there is no need for the thrust\nstructure currently integrated as pan of the forward\nskin. Therefore. with the FSB a new simplified lightweight forward skirt will be utilized.\n\nlifloff and can be accomplished\nall the way to\napproximately\n450 seconds after lifloff. This means\nwith the current system the only abort mode option\nfor the first 120 seconds is RTLS. The first available\n2\n\nAmerican\n\nInstitute\n\nof Aeronautics\n\nand Astronautics\n\ntime to achieve abort to orbit (ATO) is approximately\n250 seconds after lifioff. With the additional\n\ncurrent Shuttle system ascent constraints. Relaxing\nthese additional constraints would result in a probable\nSSME throttle setting reduction somewhere between 2\n\ncapability provided by FSB, a TAL abort mode can\nbe initiated offthe pad with an SSME throttle setting\n\nand 4 percent.\nEven though enhancingtheabortmodes isthe\nprimaryapproach evaluated partof this\nas\nPhase A\nstudyinenhancingtheoverall\nsafety\nand reliability\noftheShuttle\nsystem,theadditionalapability\nc\nprovidedby the5-segmentenablesa number of\ndifferent\noptions\nforusingtheenhanced capability.f\nI\ntheadditionalapability theFSB were used\nc\nof\nentirelyorpayloadcapability\nf\nimprovement, the\noverall\npayloadto ISS could be increased\nby\n\nof 109 percent. This means that with the FSB either\nRTLS or TAL is available to the Shuttle crew as\nabort mode options, which provides a significant\nenhancement in overall safety and intact abort\ncapability\n\nfor the system and crew.\n\nAs part of the FSB abort mode evaluation it was\ndetermined that abort to orbit (ATO) could be\nachieved using the current 5-segment booster\nconfiguration\nwith a SSME throttle seUing of 114\npercent. This assumes that the 114 percent would be\nan available option for the SSME. This may be\nquestionable considering the current block II SSMEs\nhave only been tested at 111 percent throttle setting.\nIn order to achieve 114 percent throttle setting, the\nnominal International Space Station (ISS) trajectory\nparameters were relaxed. Those that were modified\nincluded assuming that the trajectory would be\nmodified to fly due east immediately when the abort\nwas initiated. Secondly, the booster apogee constraint,\nwhich is imposed to maximize recovery success of the\nboosters was relaxed. This would not necessarily be a\nconcern in an abort mode scenario. Lastly, the angle of\nattack constraints during ascent were relaxed when\nthe abort mode was initiated. All of these constraint\nrelaxations\n\nwere felt to be well within the capability\n\napproximately\n20,000 Ibs.This,however,exceeds\nthedown-weight capability theorbiternd,as\nof\na\nsuch,themajority thatequivalent ayloadwould\nof\np\nhave to be used for abort mode enhancement or other\noptions. An additional option would be to use the\nextra capability for enabling other Shuttle system\nupgrades such as crew escape where these additional\nupgrades detract from the overall payload capability\nof the Shuttle because they increase the inert weight\nof the orbiter. Therefore. the FSB enables other\nupgrades to be incorporated with no overall\ndegradation to the orbital payload capability of the\nShuttle system. The additional capability could also\nbe used to reduce SSME throttle settings, thus\nenhancing the overall reliability of the SSMEs. The\nadditional capability could also be used to enable offnominal flight conditions, such as Chandra mission.\n\nof\n\nThe overall capability improvement offers mission\nplanners for the Shuttle system significant\nincrease in\nflexibility and options available, which is especially\nimportant when considering the utilization of the\nShuttle for an extended period into this Century.\n\nthe Shuttle system with only minor modifications\nto\ncurrent operating scenarios. As part of this ATO\nevaluation it was also determined that the SSME\nthrottle setting could be reduced even more by\nadditional modifications to flight parameters, but were\nnot quantified as part of this study. The additional\nparameters that could be re_xed include: using the\norbital maneuvering system (OMS) for thrusting\nduring ascent (at the earliest point possible in the\natmosphere where over-expansion\nin the OMS engines\nwould not be a concern), secondly start dumping the\nreaction control system (RCS) fuel as soon as the abort\nmode is initiated, and thirdly optimize the FSB thrust\nprofile to maximize the abort mode potential.\nCurrently the FSB thrust profile was configured to\nmaximize payload potential while satisfying all of the\n\nIn order to effectively address the technical feasibility\nof the FSB approach, a number of technical issues\nwere addressed during the Phase A Study effort.\nTable 1 highlights some of the major issues that were\nevaluated, with associated technical impacts and\nproposed resolutions incorporated as part of Phase A\ndesign or to be addressed during full scale\nengineering\ndevelopment.\n\n3\nAmerican\n\nInstitute of Aeronautics\n\nand Astronautics\n\nTable 1\nFSB Technical Issues\nTechnic\',d\nPropellant\n\nNozzle\n\nIssue\n\nErosive\n\nBurning\n\nReentry\n\nAnalysis shows that pressure increase\nthe order of 30 psi.\nSubscale testing being conducted to\n\nincreased pressure\nIncreased flex bearing stiffness\ndue to new bozzle aggravates\n\nTorque\n\nBooster\n\nvalidate analysis\nEvaluation conducted and no TVC redesign\nanticipated for nominal TVC Otmation\n\nSRB TVC capability\nIncreased vibroacoustic\n\nEnvironments\n\nand\n\naeroheating environments\naggravates current SRB\nAerodynamic\nEnvironments\n\ncomponent and TPS capability\nIncreased Aero & shifted shock\n\nHeating\n\nheating aggravates\ncapability\n\nPlume Induced\nEnvironments\n\nPrelaunch\n\ncurrent\n\nIncreased\n\nHeating\n\nand\n\nradiation\n\nTPS\n\nrecirculation heating aggravates\ncurrent TPS capability.\n\nLoads\n\nIncreased\n\nIgnition Over Pressure & MLP\nPlume Impingement\nEnvironment\nLoads\n\nLifioff Clearance\n\nweight\n\n& length\n\nenhances overturning moment\nwhich aggravates current SRB\nAll skirt & case capability\nIncreased environment\naggravates\nliftoff loads and SRB thermal\ncurtain\n\nLitloff\n\nResolution\n\nImpact\nPotential for propellant burn rate\nenhancement\nduring first 1-2\nseconds of burn time, resulting in\n\nAnalysis indicates no major redesign\nanticipated - will require requalification of\nsome electronic components and increased\nTPS thickness\nAnalysis indicates no major redesign\nanticipated - will require localized TPS\nthickness increases on forward SRB and ET\ncomponents\nAnalysis indicates no major redesign\nanticipated - will require localized TPS\nthickness increases on "aft SRB and ET\ncomponents\nAnalysis indicates that case and skirt are\nadequate.\nWill require Aft skirt structural\ntesting to validate analysis and use of\nstandard weight case stiffener cylinders\nNo feasibility issues but may require some\nredesign during development\nprogram\n\n& MLP capability\n\nLarger exit cone\nIncreased FSB weight and nozzle\nlength required higher thrust to\nweight to clear MLP hold down\n\nwith MLP\n\nis on\n\nTBD\nWill require system control biasing and\nmodifications\nto GN2 purge line only\n\nparts\nFCS Liftoff&\n\nI st Stage Ascent Loads\n\nPre-separation\n\nBooster\n\nLoads\n\nSeparation\n\nClearance\n\nChanges in stability aggravates\nacceptable flex criteria\n\nNo major redesign anticipated - will\nrequire returned bending filters & software\narchitecture\n\nIncreased high q and max g loads\naggravates current et component\n\nFlight Stabili .ty\n\nAnalysis shows localized\nstructure\nthickness increases required in intertank\nre,on\nRedesign of separation bolt will be needed\nduring development\n\nstructure capability\nIncreased load aggravates current\nSRB fwd separation bolt\ncapabili_\nChanges in booster length, mass\noroperties and thrust tailoff\nchanges clearance characteristics\n\nBased upon the structural and thermal interface loads\nprovided by BNA, LMSS evaluated the impact of\nthose load changes on the external tank The\nincreased structural loads resulted in higher loading\nof the intertank region, which can easily be\n\nAmerican\n\nInstitute\n\n4\nof Aeronautics\n\nAnalysis shows that FSB meets 3o\nclearance requirements\n\naccommodated\nby localized increases by thickness in\nthe intertank structure.\nThis means that less material\nwill need to be removed during the fabrication/\nmachining of the intertank.\nWith the increased length\nof the booster, the aerodynamic\nand aerothermal\n\nand Astronautics.\n\nInc.\n\nloads the\non\nthe maximum\n\nexternal tank changed somewhat where\naerothermal\nloads are now on the ogive\n\nof the ET, as opposed to in the vicinity of the booster\nattach for the current boosters.
