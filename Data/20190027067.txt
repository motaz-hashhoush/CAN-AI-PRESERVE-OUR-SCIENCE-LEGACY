b'ASTEROID CHARACTERIZATION PRIORITIES FOR PLANETARY\nDEFENSE\nPaul Miller(1), David Morrison(2), and Brent Barbee(3)\n(1)Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, PO Box 808,\nLivermore, CA, 94551; pmiller@llnl.gov\n(2)NASA/Ames Research Center, Mailstop 17-1, Moffett Field, CA,\n94089; david.morrison@nasa.gov\n(3)NASA/Goddard Spaceflight Center, Mail Code 595, 8800\nGreenbelt Road, Greenbelt, MD, 20771-0003;\nbrent.w.barbee@nasa.gov\nKeywords: asteroid,\ndeflection, disruption\n\ncharacterization,\n\nmitigation,\n\nproperties,\n\nWe propose a prioritized list of asteroid characterization needs for\nplanetary defense. In particular, we consider the properties of\nasteroids that are of greatest interest for assessment of planetary\ndefense options, including gravity tractors, kinetic impactors, and\nnuclear explosives. In addition, much of our discussion is relevant for\nimpact assessments and subsequent emergency-response\nplanning. Rather than intending this as a definitive answer, however,\nour purpose is to stimulate and focus disscussion regarding\ncharacterization needs for planetary defense, with a specific list as a\nstarting point. A key theme is understanding the sensitivity of the\noutcome of an asteroid deflection or disruption effort to the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s\nphysical properties.\n\nThere is a range of previous work relevant to our topic, including\nsome explicit discussions as well as many more that are implicitly\nrelevant. We incorporate elements from such reports while extending\nthem using our own experience and perspectives. After introducing\nour prioritized list, we provide further discussion on each element,\nwith details on the relevance of each characteristic for modeling\npurposes, our rationale for the assigned priority, and examples of\nanalyses that require improved characterization information.\n\nOur goal is to establish a framework that can be modified and\nadapted by the community for a variety of purposes, such as mission\ndesign and optimization, development of new measurement\ntechniques, or prioritization of research efforts. The objective is to\nincrease understanding and reduce uncertainties in the specific\naspects of characterization that most benefit accurate assessments\nof practical techniques for planetary defense.\n\n'
