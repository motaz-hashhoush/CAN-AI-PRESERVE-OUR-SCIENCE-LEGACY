QUaD observes the CMB with an array of 3 1 polarization-sensitive bolometers split between two frequency bands centered at 100 and 150-GHz. The telescope is a 2.6 m on-axis Cassegrain design with beam sizes of 6.3' and 4.2' at the two respective observing frequencies. QUaD was commissioned at the South Pole in the Austral summer of 2004/2005. It has since completed two full seasons of observations with a third season underway. I will report on the status of QUaD observations and analysis. QUaD is a collaboration between institutions in the US, the UK and Ireland and is funded by the NSF, PPARC and Enterprise Ireland.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20070034152, "endDate": "2007-05-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronomical Society", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "d7e1e7811a3546dd99a48101f245d885", "id": "9f5ede5255ae4046badc56398b3fdd7b"}], "name": "American Astronomical Society 210th Meeting", "location": "Honolulu, HI", "id": "d7e1e7811a3546dd99a48101f245d885", "startDate": "2007-05-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070034152, "id": "228de538760b49c4a8f6839b618a1c95", "publicationDate": "2007-05-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
