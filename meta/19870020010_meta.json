The need existed for visualizing the internal structure of flames including evaporation and combustion processes as well as for a better way of understanding spray particle generation mechanisms and internal structures. A particle sizer based on Fraunhofer diffraction for detecting particle size and in-line Fraunhofer holograms for observation of local spray particles were used. A novel visualizing technique based on Computer Technology was developed and is discussed.", "title": "Particle data reduction in Japan", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T11:28:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870020010, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nakayama, Mitsushige"}, "organization": {"name": "Gunma Univ.", "location": "Maebashi, Japan"}}, "id": "f427152c66854d27b712ac7ac7bc8799"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870020010, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870020010, "id": "750fbede971c4998964821410c7a8c9c", "publicationName": "NASA.
