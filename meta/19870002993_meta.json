The study was continued of CH3D in the spectra of Saturn and Titan. High resolution observations of O I, C2 and C-12 C-13 in the coma of P/Halley were also studied.", "title": "Outer planet studies", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T06:31:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870002993, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lutz, B.
