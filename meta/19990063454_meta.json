The algorithms are of interest in that they provides a simple systematic way of increasing or decreasing resolution, in the sense that if we have the covering in place and there is an image superimposed upon the covering, then we may view the image in a rough form or in a very detailed form with minimal effort. Such ability allows for quick searches of crude forms to determine a class in which to make a detailed search. In addition, the addressing algorithms provide an efficient way to process large data sets that have related subsets. The algorithms produced were based in part upon the work of D. Lucas \"A Multiplication in N Space\" which suggested a set of three vectors, any two of which would serve as a bases for the plane and also that the hexagon is the natural geometric object to be used in a covering with a suggested bases. The second portion is a refinement of the eyeball vision system, the globular viewer.", "title": "Mathematical Foundation for Plane Covering Using Hexagons", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T03:58:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990063454, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Johnson, Gordon G."}, "organization": {"name": "Houston Univ.", "location": "TX United States"}}, "id": "6793f0c0f6fd40c292e0012db6f9a2c0"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19990063454, "publications": [{"volume": "1", "submissionId": 19990063454, "id": "d31397dacdcd43cc80200db8b2720b5c", "publicationName": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Summer Faculty Fellowship Program, 1998", "publicationDate": "1999-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19990063441, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Summer Faculty Fellowship Program, 1998", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
