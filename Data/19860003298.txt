Perez-Albuerne\nResearch Laboratories, Eastman Kodak Company,\nRochester, New York 14650\nAbstract\n\nThe low-cost potential of thin-film solar cells can only be\nfully realized if large-area modules can be made econonically\nwith good production yields. This paper deals with two of the\ncritical challenges. A scneme is presented which allows the\nsimple, economical realization of the long recognized, preferred\nmodule structure of monolithic integration. Another scheme\nreduces the impact of shorting defects and, as a result, increases\nthe production yields. Analytical results demonstrating the\nutilization and advantages of such schemes will be discussed.\nIntroduction\n\nThin-film solar cells are actively being studied because of\ntheir potential as truly low-cost, large-scale, power-generation\ndevices. A s a result, there have been significant improvements\nin the performance of these cells in the last few years. More\nthan 10% conversion efficiency has been reported for at least\nfour material combinations: (CdZn)S/CuZS, a-Si,2 CuInSe2/CdS, 3\npotential, however, it is\nand CdS/CdTe.4 To fulfill the low--cost\nnot enough to use thin semiconductor films for device construction. Considerable efforts are required in every aspect of cell\ndesign and fabrication to ensure that these cells could be\nmarrufactured economicslly. This paper deals with two such\naspects: the large area module design and the reduction of\ndetrimental effects due to shorting defects.\nLarge-Area Module Design\n\nSince solar cells are low-voltage, high-current devices.\nlarge-area cells needed for large-scale generation of electriLity\n\nPRECEMNO PAGE BLANK\n\nNOT FILMED\n\ncannot be produCed by making large-area coatings. Some economic\nschemes for tappinc, the electrical output of the cells with\nminimum Joule losses have to be devised. This is not a trivial\nproblem with thin-film cells, since the conductivity-limiting\nelement is often the electrode layer buried under the thin active\nlayers. Grid electrodes commonly used for bulk single-crystal or\npolycrystal cells cannot be used. In fact, even in cells whose\nstructure allows the use of grid electrodes, pinhole problems (to\nbe discussed later) make this approach undesirable. Instead, a\nmonolithic integration design is preferred.\nIn a monolithic integration design, a large-area s o l x cell\nis divided into small area elements which are then connected in\nseries. This has the benefit that the voltage rather than the\ncurrent of the small area elements is added when a large-area\ncell is made, and it also reduces the current path. Both tend to\nreduce the Joule loss. The merits of such a design for large-area\nsolar modules have long been recognized.\xe2\x80\x99-lo With techniques\nsuch as photolithography developed for integrated circuits, it is\nalso obviaus that, although the process will be rather expensive,\nthe design is technically feasible. The challenge is to design a\nscheme and a process compatible with the large-scale manufacturing\nof solar modules at low cost.\nEarlier, we presented such a scheme using a CdS/CdTe thinfilm cell as an example.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 This is done by dividing the transparent conductive IT0 or SnG2 coating (Fig. la) into electrically\nisolated, elongated stripes (Fig. lb). Continuous CdS and CdTe\nlayers are then coated (Fig. IC), followed by a scribing process\ndesigned to expose some of the underlying conductive coating\n(Fig. Id). A continuous top electrode layer is then coated,\nmaking contact to the exposed transgarent conductive layer\n(Fig. le). A third scribing process separates the top electrode\nlayer into stripes, completing the integration (Fig. If).\nFigure 2 shows the perspective view of a completed module.\nThis scheme using throe scribing operations to complete the\nmonolithic integration is attractive because it does not use the\nexpensive photofabrication process. Furthermore, no masking is\nneeded in any of the thin-film deposition processes, and only\n96\n\none-dimensional registration is required during the scribing\nsteps. The spacial relationship of the three scribe lines also\nrelaxes the registration requirements making the scheme compatible\nwith low-cdst production processes.\nScribing can be done by a variety of methods. For the\ntransparent conductive layer, laser scribing is desirable because\nof its speed and cleanliness, and because of the mechanical\nhardness of the layer. For the other two cases, however, the\nnecessity to scribe the top layers without damaging the underlying\ntransparent conductive layer and the potential for laser-induced\ndegradation of electrical properties in the semiconducting layers\nmake mechanical scribing more desirable. The CdS/CdTe cell is\nparticularly suitable for mechanical scribing because these\nsemiconductor layers are much softer than the Sn02 or IT0 layers.\nIncreasing the width of the individual cell elements reduces\nthe fraction of wasted area due to integration but j.acrea!ses the\ncurrent path and hence the Joule loss. Ths optimum cell width is\ntherefore determined by seeking a compromise between these two\nfactors. It is easy to show that the power loss due to these two\nmechanisms can be expressed by\n\nP = J2RL 3 (L\n,\n\n+\n\nW)'\n\n+\n\nPW(L + W)-l\n\nwhera J and P are the current haadpower density of the cell at\nthe operating point, respectively; Rn is the sheet resistivity of\nthe oxide layer, W is the width of the wasted region due to\nscribing, and L is the active width of the cell. Assuming\nW << L, the optimum width of the cell can be expressec' by:\n1/3\n\nFor a given kind of cell it is thus determined by the conductivity\nof the conducting oxide and the amount of area wasted for scribing. The calculated optimum element width and the corresponding\n\n97\n\npower loss are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 for a sample case of P = 10\nmW/cmz and J = 18 mA/cmz.\nThe Pinhole Problem\n\nAnother problem unique to thin-film cells is that of hortin\npinholes. This problem arises because thin-film solai cells\noften use two continuous electrode layers separated from e z r i\nother only by the semiconductors, which are just a few micrometers\nthick. Any defects in the semiconductor layers might result in a\nshort between these electrodes, severely degrading the cell\nperformance.\nAandomly distributed pinholes can be described by the\nPoissoii di stribution :\n\nwhere P(x, A, Ndj gives the probability of finding defects in an\narea A with an average defect density Nd. Thus, the probability\nof finding a defect-free cell is:\nP(0,\n\nA, Nd) = exp(-A*hd)\n\n(4)\n\nThis probability is thus extremely area sensitive. For\nexample, for a defect density of O.OO1/cmz, the prcJability of\ngetting a defect-free 1-cm2 cell is maybe aa high as 99.9%,\neasily leading one to conclude that defect problems do not exist\nin this thin-film cell system. In fact, however, the probability\nof producing just a 1000-cm' cell is less then 37% (Table 1).\n\n98\n\nTable 1.\n\nYields of Pinhole bree Cells\n\nPibyhole\nDensity, cm\n\n-2\n\nArea, cm'\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n99.99\n\n99.9\n\n99\n\n90.5\n\n1\n\n99.9\n\n99\n\n90.5\n\n36.8\n\n99\n\n90.5\n\n36.8\n\n5\n\n100\n\n90.5\n\n36.8\n\n5\n\n1000\n\n36.8\n\n5\n\n4 x 10-44\n\n10\n\n1\n\nlom5\n4 x 10-44\n0\n\nSince large-area cells have to be fabricated in a mass\nproduction environment, and care in manufacturing process control\ncan only reduce defect density to a certain limit, it is desirable\nto devise a scheme that would reduce the detrimental effect of\ndefects if they do exist. The scheme has to be compatible with\nlow-cost processes also. The use of the monolithic intc?grat'\nscheme accomplishes some of this mission. The area of the iL\na\nis divided into many elements, which are then connecteu 5n\nseries. A defect degrades only the element it resides on and FQt\nthe whole cell; its effect is thus reduced.\nThe detrimental effect cf defects can be further reauced k ,\n,\na cross-cutting scheme.l2 Basically, an integrated moa,\n1.\nindiscriminately dividcd into many parallel subarrays by i\n.\n; ;y,\nperpendicular to the direction of the scribes for integration,\nthrough all the thin-film coatings on the substrate (Fig. 5).\nThe subarrays are electrically isolated from each other except at\nthe two ends, where common electrodes cc,inect them in parallel.\nThe beneficial effect of cross-cutting can be appreciated\nfrom a special example (Fig. 6). A module having 10 cells\nconnected in a series is assumed to have 10 defects strategically\nplaced such that there is a defect in each individual element.\nThe whole module is inoperative because all the elements are\nshorted. Now if the module is cross-cut into 10 subarrays each\ncontaining just one defect, only 10% of the power output from the\n,1\n\n99\n\nmodule is lost becaus-. only one element in each subarrdy is\nshorted.\nThe effect of cross-curting in a more general case can be\nanalyzed as follows. We assume that all cel1.s behave ideally\nwith their I-V relationship given by\n\neV\nI = Io(exp --.\nnkT\n\n-\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Io is the reverse saturation current, IL is the light\ngenerated current, n is the diode factor, e is the electron\ncharge, and k is the Boltzmann's constant. We also assume that\nall defects behave like perfectly conducting paths, rendering the\ncell elements on which they reside totally inoperative but not\nadding any series resistance to the rest of the array.\nThe defect density has to be in a reasonable range P?r the\ncross-cutting to be effective or mea:,ingfiil. Too high a defect\ndensity necessitates cross-cutting the array into such fine\ndivisions that it becomes impractical. It is easy to &ow that.,\nwith such reasmable defect density, for a module of area A\nconsisting of N cells connected in series and divided into M\nsubarrays, esseutially none of the . )M subcells contain more than\none defect. T?*.s subarray with x defects uehaves like one with\na\n(N x ) subce.tisin a series. The J-V relationshi? of such a\nAbarray can be represented k.11\n\n-\n\n-\n\n11\n\nSince an array is constructed of 1.1 subarrays in parallel, the I-V\nrelationship of the array is given by\n\nwhere the subscript i denotes the ith sdbsrray.\n\nLOO\n\nIn practical applications, many of these arrays are connected\nin parallel. The large number of subarrays involved justifies\nthe use of probabilities and Eq. (7)is replaced by:\n\nwhere x is the probability for finding x defects in a subarray:\n\nGiven the values for the various constants in Eq. ( 8 1 , the power\noutput of the parallel assembly can be calculated and compared\nwith that of a defect-free case (x = 0,Nd = 0).\nSuch calculations have been carried out using parameters for\nan idealized thin-film CdS/CdTe solar cell:3 IL = 19 mA/cmZ,\n\n- 10\n\nA/cm2, n = 1.78 under 75 mW/c;m2 of AM2 suilight.\nIn these calculations the array is assumed to consist of 60 cells\nin a series. Figures 7 and 8 show the calculated power loss ana\nvQc respectively, as a function of cross-cutting for several\nNd*A values. Figure 9 compares the power loss as a function of\nNd*A between an undivided array and ane which has been divided\ninto 10 subarrays. The reduction of power l o s s is substantial,\nand this reduction is achieved through indiscriminative crosscutting of the array.\nThe power l o s s can be further reduced by increasing crosscutting, but the marginal benefit decreases. In practice the\ndegree of cross-cutting is determined by a balance between the\nbenefit and the added production c ~ s t s well as area lost due\nas\nto cross-cutting.\nI o = 5.4 x 10\n\nS ummar .\n,\n\nTwo simple schemes which improve the potential for low-cost\nproduction of large area thin-film solar cell modules have been\npresented. The analysis was carrieci out based on thin-film CdS/\n101\n\nCdTe solar cells but the schemes should be generally applicable\nto other thin-film cells as well.\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nR. B. Hsll, R. W.

We are in the situation where\nwe are not producing 1 ft2 cells. We are in the laboratory, so\nour yield is pretty good, about 99%. We are not actually\nexperiencing a large number of defects. What we are presenting\nhere is a schome that will take care of defects when you make\nlarge-area modules. It doesn't really matter what kind of shorts\nyou have.\n\nLESK: Your cad telluride is quite conductive compared with intrinsic\namorphous silicon. If you had a short Just through the cad\nsulfide layer, it would make it look like a short all the way\nthrough, is that right?\n\nTYAN: Cad sulfide is a semiconductor also.\n\nIn the process we use the cad\nsulphide is rather insulated. So, even if we have a direct short\nbetween metal and cad sulfide, you still have some contact with\nresistance, which may or may not be enough when you try to make a\nmodule. We still have the shorting problem due to that contact.\nYou can reduce the impact by doing this.\n\nROYAL:\n\nI noticed that there are very high temperatures in the process, where\nyou have a substrate temperature of 6OOOC or so. Are there any\nproblems in that area?\n\nTYAN: That is the only way we know of making it.\nEICKLBR:\n\nYERKES:\n\nIt might be worth pointing out to people who contemplate using this\nprocess that Eastman Kodak has patented this design. Am I correct?\nWhy don't you go ahead and make a 1 ft2 array? What is holding you\nup? We've been hearing this from Kodak since 1982. Let's go\nahead and do something!\n\n111\n\n"
