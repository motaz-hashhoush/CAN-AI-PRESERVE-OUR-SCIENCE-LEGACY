In addition, the HEDS Enterprise is collaborating with the Space Science Enterprise to acquire needed early knowledge about Mars and to demonstrate critical technologies via robotic missions. This paper provides an overview of the technological challenges facing NASA as it prepares for human exploration. Emphasis is placed on identifying the key technologies including those which will provide the most return in terms of reducing total mission cost and/or reducing potential risk to the mission crew. Top-level requirements are provided for those critical enabling technology options currently under consideration.", "title": "Preparing for Human Exploration", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T01:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990025827, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Drake, Bret G."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "b272f4321dd34248b31f380ec04aa229"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19990025827, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Joosten, B.
