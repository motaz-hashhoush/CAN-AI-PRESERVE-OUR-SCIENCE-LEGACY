The aircrew indicated that they were in visual meteorological\nconditions\n(VMC) and would visually\ncircumnavigate\nthe thunderstorms.\nTwo\nminutes later, the aircraft failed to respond to a transponder\nchange.\nThe\naircraft\nbroke apart\nin flight, went out of control,\nand crashed.\nCrew\nmembers and passengers perished in the crash.\nThe aircraft had flown close to\nthunderstorm\ncells and, as a result,\nencountered\nextreme\nturbulence\nwhich\nfailed the #4 pylon and right wing.\n\n18\n\nA lot of action was generated by this mishap. For example, the weather\nradar which had been experiencing a lot of reliability\nand maintainability\nproblems was replaced with a much better and more reliable system. The Air\nForce came out with muchmore specific guidance on thunderstorm avoidance in\nour basic flight rules.\nFinally, there was a call for increased research in\nthe area of severe weather avoidance.\nA Multiagency Conference on Severe Convective Storms and Their Hazards\nto Aviation was held on February 16 and 17, 1977. A number of agencies were\nrepresented at this conference:\nNational Weather Service, Environmental\nResearch Labs, National Severe Storms Lab, National Severe Storms Forecast\nCenter, FAA, NTSB, NASA, Lockheed, University of Chicago, and Air Force\nInspection and Safety Center.\nSomeof the recommendationsthat cameout of the conference are given in\nTable 3. With regards to the first recommendation, a number of studies have\nbeen conducted on thunderstorms by the National Severe Storms Lab and other\nagencies. For the second, the Air Force has acquired films on thunderstorm\navoidance and other training aids.\nThe third recommendation was covered in\nour corrective action.\nThe fourth, a test program was established to see if\nfull-time\nweather expertise would be useful at Kansas City Air Route Traffic\nControl Center.\nFlight simulation techniques have been developed for\nlow-level wind shear and are used in Air Force cargo aircraft\nflight simulator\nprograms. The last recommendationwas covered in our corrective action.\nThe second major mishap occurred when a trainer aircraft\npenetrated a\nthunderstorm at high altitude.\nThe mishap pilot accepted a routing from air\ntraffic\ncontrol which had more severe weather than what had been forecast for\nthis flight\nplanned route.\nWhenthe pilot entered significant\nweather, he\nreported it to ATC. The controller offered the pilot a 180\xc2\xb0 turn as there\nwere cells in all quadrants.\nThe pilot received clearance to climb (even\nthough the aircraft\nwas already out of its engine operating envelope).\nAt\nflight\nlevel 464, still\nin the cell, both engines flamed out.\nThe aircraft\ntraveled 5.4 nautical miles from its last radar painted position to its point\nof impact in 2 minutes 9 seconds. It was hypothesized that severe turbulence\nwithin the storm contributed to spatial disorientation\nand a delayed decision\nto eject.\nThe aircraft\ndid not have an on-board weather radar.\nThe mishap\npilot had significant\nflight\nexperience, including being a graduate of Air\nForce Test Pilot School, but let his good Judgment get side-tracked by intense\nmotivation\nto get to his destination.\nThere were no weather-related\ncorrective actions taken as a result of this mishap.\nOur third Class A mishap occurred in 1985 when a forward air controller\n(FAC) aircraft,\nencountered turbulence and downdrafts associated with a\nmountain wave phenomena. Mountain wave had not been forecast prior to the\nmishap flight.\nA pilot report of severe turbulence was issued by a helicopter\nafter the mishap aircraft was airborne, but the information was not relayed to\nthe mishap pilot.\nIt was determined that the mishap aircraft got into an area\nof downdrafts which exceeded the aircraft\'s\ncapability\nto climb to avoid\nterrain.\nSearch for the crash site was hamperedby severe turbulence in the\narea.\n\n19\n\nAs a result of this mishap, a warning was put in the aircraft\nflight\nmanual that in even moderate turbulence vertical gust velocities could exceed\nthe aircraft\'s\nclimb capabilities.\nLess than two months later,\nanother FAC aircraft\nwas lost when it\npenetrated severe weather as it attempted to return to base during a weather\nrecall.\nThe mishap pilot whose visual routes of escape had been closed off by\nweather moving in from all directions\ndecided to climb to 5,000 feet in\ninstrument meteorological conditions (IMC) so that he could be radar vectored\naround the severe weather.\nDuring his IMC climb, he encountered a severe\nupdraft which he interpreted as an attitude indicator failure.\nHe then madea\nright descending turn to get back into visual (VMC) conditions.\nThe mishap\npilot then failed to reduce his high-power setting and the aircraft\nentered a\nnose-low, high-speed descent.\nThe left wing failed at approximately 2,500\nfeet AGL due to high speed and turbulence.\nThe aircraft\nentered a left\nuncontrollable roll and was completely destroyed on impact, fatally\ninjuring\nthe pilot.\nActions and suggestions coming from this mishap were similar to those of\nthe other FACaircraft mishaps. A warning regarding the dangers of flying low\nto medium performance aircraft\nin the vicinity\nof severe updrafts or\ndowndrafts were recommended\nfor Air Force Manual 51-12, "Weather for Aircrew,"\nas well as a similar warning for the aircraft flight manual.\nFinally, in our last turbulence-related mishap a transport aircraft was\nperforming a medical evacuation mission into a remote site.\nCrosswinds on\nthis approach were high requiring occasional full use of cross controls.\nA\nturbulent downdraft destabilized the aircraft a quarter mile from the runway.\nAs this was a one-way site, one that requires that you fly your approach in\none direction and your departure in the opposite direction--due\nto rising\nterrain in three quadrants--and they were already past the commit point (the\npoint past which go-around is improbable), the pilot was committed to land.\nThe aircraft touched down in a left drift and continued to drift left until it\ndeparted the runway. The aircraft\nsustained significant\ndamage. There were\nno weather-related corrective actions taken as a result of this mishap. This\nconcludes the look at our Class A turbulence-related mishaps.\nTable 4 summarizes the last ten years of Class C turbulence-related\nmishaps. A Class C mishap is any damagethat is between $1000 and $100,000.\nI will not go into detail on these mishaps unless someonehas a particular\nquestion.\nCopies of our Class C investigations are not retained except for a\nbrief narrative summary which is put into our computer.\nIf the summary\nmentioned that turbulence was forecast, this was noted as a yes or no; if it\nwas not mentioned, unknown (UNK) was noted.\nAlso, if the airspeeds and\naltitudes\nat which the turbulence was encountered were contained in the\nsummary, this is noted on the charts.\nIn reviewing the Class C mishaps, two major trends were noticed.\nFirst,\nthat most of these mishaps occurred in large aircraft\nand second that most\nturbulence-related\ninjuries\nwere sustained by unrestrained occupants.\nIn\ntalking with fighter aircraft\naction officers\n(by the way, I am the C-130\naction officer),\ntheir comment was that high-performance aircraft\nare not\n\n20\n\nusually adversely affected by turbulence. Fighter aircraft\nare built for high\n"G" loading, and when they do hit turbulence, crew membersare always well\nrestrained.\nI believe the reason we have a very good record in the area of\nturbulence-related\nmishaps is that our aircrews maintain a high level of\nawareness of severe weather. It is a frequent topic in our safety magazines,\nit is covered in pilot training,\nannual instrument refresher training,\nand\naircrew briefings from our Air Weather Service people. Another factor is that\ngood weather forecasting keeps us away from severe weather and turbulence.\nSome areas where I see improvement for the future\nin turbulence\navoidance includes better aircraft\nand ground-based weather radar.\nNEXRAD,\nwhich should come on line in the early 1990\'s, will\nhave a turbulence\nalgorithm.\nFor improved forecasting, the Air Weather Service has recently\ncompleted a geophysical requirement for future turbulence research (defining\nAir Force and Army future forecasting needs). It is presently under review at\nAir Force Geophysics Labs. Dr. Dale Meyer from Air Weather Service, who was\nat this conference, is involved in this effort and has told me that he would\nbe glad to give any of you who are interested in this geophysical requirement\nan overview of the project.\nQUESTION:Dave O\'Keefe (Lockheed). I noticed in your Class C you had an F105\nwhere the vertical\nstabilizer\nbroke apart or suffered damage due to\nturbulence.\nWas there any indication that there was a fatigue problem or\nthere were corrosion problems? Were there any investigations\nas to why that\nstabilizer\nbroke apart?\nANSWER:No, we do not retain copies of our Class C investigations.\nAll I had\nto go on was a computer short summary. There were no indications at all of\nstructural\nfatigue.\nThe F105 is an old airplane, but it seemsthat if there\nhad been indications, they would have been mentioned in our findings and they\nweren\xc2\xb0t.\nQUESTION: Capt. Ed Harrison (The Pentagon). As the C130 action officer you\nshould be well equipped to answer this one. I noticed the Air Force uses\nC130\'s for hurricane and typhoon reconnaissance. I was just curious as to\ntheir weather-related safety record.\nThey are flying directly into the jaws\nof danger.\nDo they have a significant\nexperience with turbulence-related\nincidents?\nANSWER:That is a good question.\nI knowof one C130mishap of a weather C130\nflying into a typhoon in the Pacific in 1974. They never found the airplane\nso they were never able to determine what exactly caused the failure of the\naircraft.\nQUESTION: Mike Tomlinson (Air Weather Service).\nIn your listing\nof the\nfactors that you think are involved in a relatively\ngood safety record, a\nfactor that I didn\'t see that I think should be there is the need for pretty\ntight operational rules that specify when certain levels of turbulence are\nforecast.\nDo you think that is a significant factor, and because you\'re not\n\n21\n\nout there when the forecast calls for severe turbulence, are you less likely\nto be exposed to those conditions and have resulting accidents?\nANSWER:Yes, you are. I guess I did fail to mention that as a result of that\n1976 C141 accident, they did come up with very specific\nguidance on\nthunderstorm avoidance. And that has, unfortunately, been relaxed since that\ntime. For a while the Air Force as a whole had a regulation telling you how\nfar you had to stay away from thunderstorms. You had to be 20 miles downwind\nor 10 miles upwind, I don\'t remember the exact parameters. After that, the\nfighter community wanted different\nlimitations.\nThat parameter still\nexists\nin military airlift\ncommand\nsupplement to 60-16, the general flight rules, but\nit is not in the Air Force regulation itself.\nBut you\'re right.\nIt is very\ntrue that we do have a lot of operating restrictions\nthat keep us out of\nsevere weather.\nCOMMENT:\nDale Meyer (HQAir Weather Service).\nAs was pointed out, I will\nglad to discuss our perspective of Air Force and Army requirements.\nQUESTION: George Trevi_o (Michigan Tech).\nWill photocopies of all\nslides and presentations be madeavailable to the participants?\n\nbe\n\nthese\n\nANSWER:To answer your question on my briefing in particular,\nthere are parts\nof it in which I went into specifics, such as places and types of aircraft,\nand they are "For Official\nUse Only."\nWhat I\'m going to do is give to the\nworkshop organization all of my briefing which is not restricted and present a\nsummarythat won\'t namethe specific aircraft.\nQUESTION:Al Bedard (NOAA). You have a criteria\nfor classifying the strength\nof turbulence which I believe dealt with the G forces, if I read that slide\ncorrectly.\nIs that widely accepted by the defense community or is that your\nown internal classification?\nANSWER:That is something I think AWS\nwould be better\nDr. Meyer can probably answer that better than I can.\n\nat answering.\n\nI think\n\nANSWER:Dale Meyer (HQAir Weather Service).\nWedo have a procedure that was\ndeveloped by the Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories in 1981 that uses\ngust loading to classify all Air Force aircraft\ninto four categories.\nWeuse\nthat information operationally\nin tailoring\nour forecasts and interpreting\nPIREPS. I don\'t have the details with me but I have access to them.\n\n22\n\nTABLE 2.\n\nTRANSPORT\nTRAINER\n\nAIRCRAFT\n\nFORWARD\n\nAir\n\nForce\n\nAIRCRAFT\nCONTROL\n\nAIR CONTROLLER\n\nTurbulence-Related\n\nClass\n\nIN-FLIGHT BREAKUP;\n\nLOSS;\n\nA Mishaps.\n\nNEAR THUNDERSTORM\n\nIN THUNDERSTORM\n\n(FAC) COLLISION\n\nWITH THE GROUND\n\nDURING MOUNTAIN\n\nWAVE ENCOUNTER\n\nFAC AIRCRAFT\n\nIN-FLIGHT\n\nBREAKUP\n\nIN THUNDERSTORM\n\nUPDRAFTS\n\nAND TURBULENCE\n\nTRANSPORT\n\nAIRCRAFT\n\nBY TURBULENT\n\nTABLE 3.\n\nRUNWAY DEPARTURE\n\nAFTER APPROACH\n\nDESTABILIZED\n\nDOWNDRAFT\n\nMultiagency\n\nConference\n\non Severe\n\nConvective\n\nStorms\n\nand Their\n\nHazards\n\nto\n\nAviation.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n-\n\nTHE NEED FOR BASIC RESEARCH INTO THE LOCATION, DURATION, AND\nINTENSITY OF TURBULENCE IN THE VICINITY OF THUNDERSTORMS\n\n-\n\nNEW AIRCREW TRAINING AIDS\n\n-\n\nBETTER GROUND-BASED AND AIRBORNE-WEATHER RADAR\n\n-\n\nASSIGNING FULL-TIME WEATHER EXPERTISE IN THE AIR TRAFFIC\nCONTROL SYSTEM\n\n-\n\nDEVELOP FLIGHT SIMULATION TECHNIQUES WITH REGARD TO LOW-LEVEL\nWIND SHEAR\n\n-\n\nREVIEW AND STRENGTHEN REGULATIONS AND CRITERIA WITH REGARD TO\nPENETRATING HAZARDOUS WEATHER\n\n23\n\nTABLE 4.\n\nWAS TURBULENCE\nFORECAST\n\nClass\n\nC Turbulence-Related\n\nALTITUDE/AIRSPEED\n\nMishaps.\n\nDAMAGE\n\n1976\nT-39A\n\nNO\n\nFL410/220 KIAS\n\nENGINE FLAMEOUT\n\nEC-135J\n\nUNK\n\nFL310\n\nCAT CAUSES OSCILLATIONS/FAILURE TRAILING\nOF\nWIRE ANTENNA\n\n1977\nC-130B\n\nUNK\n\nFL110\n\nCHAIN BOX LATCHES FAIL WHEN A/C ENCOUNTERS\nSEVERE TURBULENCE IN CLOUD\n\nB-52G\n\nYES/MOD\n\nHIGH ALT/300 KIAS\n\nSEVERE TURB THROWS CREW VIOLENTLY ABOUT\n\nT-38A\n\nUNK\n\nFL210/300 KIAS\n\nDAMAGE TO LEADING EDGES OF BOTH WINGS AND\nVERT STABILIZER WHEN AIRCRAFT ENTERED AREA OF\nHEAVY RAIN AND MODERATE TO SEVERE TURBULENCE\n\nTRAFFIC PATTERN/\n\nDAMAGE TO FLAPS WHEN A/C ENCOUNTEREUMODERATE\nTURBULENCE IN RAINSHOWERS\n\n1978\nB-52G\n\nYES\n\n1979\nC-130H\n\nNO\n\nLOW ALT\n\nLOADMASTER BREAKS LEG WHEN A/C ENCOUNTERS\nSEVERE CAT\n\nB-52H\n\nYES\n\nUNK\n\nMODERATE TURBULENCE CAUSED DAMAGE TO BOMB\nDOORS, WHILE OPEN\n\nEC-135H\n\nUNK\n\nFL330\n\nTRAILING WIRE ANTENNA SEPARATES DUE TO CAT\n\nC-130A\n\nUNK\n\ni000 AGL/125 KIAS\n\nLOADMASTER BREAKS WRIST WHEN A/C ENCOUNTERS\nCAT\n\nC-130B\n\nNO\n\nUNKNOWN\n\nCREW CHIEF INJURES BACK WHEN A/C ENCOUNTERS\nMODERATE CAT\n\nUNK\n\nFL180/240 KIAS\n\nTWO CREWMEMBERS INJURED WHEN A/C ENCOUNTERS\nA SEVERE DOWNDRAFT\n\n1980\n\n1981\nC-130A\n\n24\n\nTABLE 4.\n\n(concluded).\n\nWAS TURBULENCE\nFORECAST\nALTITUDE/AIRSPEED\nDAMAGE\n1981\nF-IO5D\n\nUNK\n\n1000 FT AGL/\n5O0 KIAS\n\nPART UF VERTICAL STABILIZER LOST WHEN A/C\nENCOUNTEREDSEVERE TURBULENCE EN ROUTE TO\nRANGE\n\nC-130H\n\nNO\n\nFL160\n\nTWO CREWMEMBERS INJURED WHEN A/C ENCOUNTERS\nABRUPT SEVERE CAT\n\nYES\n\nSO00 MSL\n\nPASSENGER INJURED WHEN A/C ENTERS AREA OF\nHEAVY WEATHER AND SEVERE TURBULENCE\n\nKC-135A\n\nUNK\n\nFL220\n\nAIC SUSTAINS CRACKS IN ALL FORWARD ENGINE\nMOUNTS WHEN A/C ENCOUNTERSSEVERE TURBULENCE\n\nC-130B\n\nYES\n\nLOW LEVEL\n\nFIVE AIRCREW SUSTAIN INJURIESWHEN A/C\nENCOUNTERSMOUNTAIN WAVE\n\n1982\nKC-135\n\n1985\n\n25\n\n'
