Antenna-Mechanical Subsystem Field\nInstrumentation-Modular Concept,\n\n(1) An instrumentation trailer embodying storage and\nwork space was not needed, due to the on-location\navailability of such facilities.\n\nJ . A. Carpenter\n\na. Introduction. During erection of the antennamechanical subsystem, instrumentation (including strain\ngauges, accelerometers, fluid and gas-pressure-sensing\ndevices, recording anemometers, force gauges, thermocouples, and extensometers) is needed for installation,\nalignment, and performance evaluation.\nDuring the early days of antenna installation, due to\na lack of field housing facilities, instrumentation trailers\nwere designed and built which housed not only the recording instrumentation needed in association with the\nabove listed sensing devices, but also work and storage\nspace. The subsequent history of utilization showed that\nthe trailers spent from 40 to 75% of their life in transit\nand involved excessive handling, maintenance, and customs processing.\n\nb. Design criteria. A re-evaluation of the utilization of\nthis type of field instrumentation developed the following\ncriteria :\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-60, VOL. I1\n\n(2) The instrumentation assemblies configuration\nshould be as light and compact as reasonable and\nshould lend itself to any mode of transport-air,\nsea, or land.\n(3) The instrumentation assembly should be configured\nin discrete modules to support specific needs and\navoid shipment of equipment not required for a\nspecific task.\n\n(4) The modular concept should allow for easy expansion of the assembly to the complexity required.\n\n(5) The design of the instrumentation assembly should\nbe simple enough to be able to be used at any skill\nlevel and to require minimum maintenance.\nc. Final configuration. A modular instrumentation\nassembly concept was developed which affords the following:\n(1) The basic equipment is resolved into two subunits:\n(a) an analog recording configuration with a strip\n\nrecorder for quick field looks and analyses; and\n(b) a parallelable analog tape recording unit\n(Fig. 1) for storing data from the strip recorder for\nlater more complex analysis or digital processing.\n\n(2) The two instrumentation subunits are mounted permanently in shock-proof shipping containers.\n(3) These contaiilers are weatherproof for shipping\nand field housing.\n\n(4) The shipping and housing containers are of dimensions acceptable for commercial air shipment, when\nnecessary.\n2. Damage Prevention System for 85-ft Antenna,\nJ . Carlucci\n\na. Introduction. As a result of operational experience\nand an analysis of the safety needs of the DSIF antennas,\na system has been designed which will allow the servo\noperator to monitor the antenna and surrounding area,\nand to control or prevent vehicles, equipment, and personnel intrusion. Due to the layout of the servo console,\nwindows, hydromechanics building, cable trays and\nassociated antenna hardware, it is presently impossible\nfor the servo operator to perform control and monitoring\nfunctions continuously.\n\nb . Problem. The general problem was reduced to two\ncategories :\n(1) Development of a barrier-alarm system that would\nnot only prevent movement of hardware or equipment on and off the antenna pad without the\nservo operator\'s knowledge, but would have some\nreasonable form of interaction with the antennas\ndrive system operation, and a11 alarm arrangement.\n(2) Development of a surveillance system that would\ngive an acceptable picture both day and night, for\nmoilitoring the antenna and surrounding area.\n\nc. Solution.\n\nBarrier-alar?n system. Figure 2 shows a conceptual layout of the proposed barrier and safety alarm system (and\nthe surveillance system) at DSS 11. This concept will be\nthe basic one for all DSS alarm systems.\nThis system consists of a sectionalized chain link fence\naround the circumference of the antenna at a 260-ft\ndiameter, with two 20-ft gates with locks and two 3-ft\ngates for personnel. An integrity cable runs around the\ntop of the fence. The fence and integrity cable are made\n138\n\nFig. 1 .

Proposed barrier a n d safety alarm system\n\nThe safety alarm arrangement is a visual configuration\nwhich has a light bank reading "Hardware on Pad" when\ngates or fence sections are opened. In order to open the\naccess gates a key must be removed from the servo console, which subsequently shuts down the servo. The shift\nsupervisor also has a key which allows access to the\nantenna pad, on an emergency basis without disabling\nthe servo, obtainable only with his approval.\nIncluded in this system is a time delay which requires\nthat the access key be in the switch and the TV system\nbe operational for 5 min prior to servo power coming on.\nThis is to make sure the servo operator surveys the\nantenna and area before operating the drive system.\nSwueillnnce system.

The\ncamera has a 10:l zoom lens, mounted in an all-weather\nhousing that is hermetically sealed, and all circuits are\nsolid state.\nMeasurements made at DSS 1 indicated that existing\n1\narea lighting was not sufficient to produce an acceptable\npicture at night. Therefore, the following requirements\nwere adopted: the general scene area lighting, as measured at the TV camera, should be at least 0.1 ft-cd\n(preferably 1.0 ft-cd); the total distance from light source\nto antenna should be 140 ft and from antenna to camera\n130 ft; for an emperically resolved actual reflection coefficient of about 0.20, there should be at least 1500-W\n139\n\n3.0 ft-cd\n\n5 x lom4L\n\nFig. 3.

A new type of exciter phase modulator\nwas developed to provide improved performance and the\ncapability of setting modulation indices more precisely.\nhe phase modulator presently used in the lock I11 c\nS-band receivedexciter subsystem has a specified modulation linearity of +5% over the range of indices from\n0 to 2.4 rad at S-band. System measurements confirm that\nthis is close to the limit of the capability of the present\nmodulator design.\n-\n\n1to 1.5ft-cd\n5 x lo-*ft-L\n\n1.09 ft-cd\n5.55 x\n\nft-L\n\nThe number of lumens per unit area squared\n\nI\nE = -cos 6 cos 4 ft-cd\nr2\nwhere\n\nI = light intensity, cd\nr2 = distance from light source, ft\n6 = angle of incidence (zenith plane) to camera\nrelative to reflecting surface\n\n4 = angle of incidence (vertical plane) to camera\nrelative to reflecting surface\n140\n\nThe present modulator design utilizes voltage-variable\ncapacitors within a low-Q resonant circuit to achieve\nphase modulation. Due to the inherent nonlinear characteristic of capacitance variation versus applied voltage,\nvoltage-variable capacitors are not suitable in a design\nrequiring better than 5% linearity over large modulation\nindices. The design performance requirement of the new\nmodulator is that the linearity be maintained within 1%\nfor indices up to 2.4 rad at S-band.\n\nb. Modulutor design (ideal). A block diagram of the\nphase modulator module is shown in Fig. 4. The module\nbeing developed also contains a X3 frequency multiplier\nahead of the modulator. The 22-MHz input signal is\namplified and amplitude-limited by amplifiers A1 and A2\nand coupled to a wideband diode X3 frequency multiplier. The multiplier output is filtered by a commercial\nfilter centered at 66 MHz. The 66 MHz is then amplified\n(A3 and A4) and coupled to a 90-deg hybrid which provides two output ports, one having an in-phase signal\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-60, VOL.

Each output port\nis then coupled to a commercial balanced mixer (M1 and\nM2) which is used as a voltage-variable attenuator. The\ncontrol voltage on these mixers is the difference between\nthe bias voltage and the voltage of the input modulation\nsignal from the broadband video driver amplifier A5.\nSince the bias voltage on mixer M1 is positive and on\nmixer M2 is negative, the inodulation signal will create\ncontrol voltages that cause the attenuation of one mixer\nto increase while the attenuation of the other mixer\ndecreases. These amplitude-modulated signals are then\ncombined to produce a phase-modulated signal (discussed\nin more detail later). The combined carriers are subsequently amplified (A6 and A7) and applied to two\nisolated outputs through emitter followers.\nThe process of generating a phase-modulated carrier\nfrom amplitude nlodulation is not a new concept, but it\nwas considered because of its capability of linear modulation over a large range of indices. The modulation\nprocess is best described in Fig. 5. Without the presence\nof modulation (assuming equal RF levels from each\nmodulator, M1 and M2) the carrier vectors add as shown.\nWhen a positive modulating voltage is applied, the RF\noutput amplitude of M1 increases linearly by the factor m\nand the output of M2 decreases linearly by m; a resultant\ncarrier phase displacement (+) occurs. Conversely, a\nnegative modulation voltage results in a negative phase\n(-+) deviation. Figure 5 illustrates, then, an ideal situa-\n\ntion whcrc the unmodulated outputs of M1 and M2 are\nidentical, and their output levels vary linearly with modulation voltage.\nAssuming the ideal case and that M1 and A42 are\nnormalized to a value of 1, then the maximum linear\n( t l % ) range of modulation can be determined from\nFig. 5, as follows:\nl+m\na = tan-\' 1-m\nand the phase deviation is\nl f m\n+ = a - 45 deg = tan-\' -- 45 deg\n1-m\n\n(2)\n\nTo obtain the modulation sensitivity for very low indices\nSo+\n\n=&[tan-\' - 45 deg]l\n13.m\n1-m\n-\n\ndm I,,=,\n\nn1=o\n\nSo = 1rad/modulation unit (peak)\n\n(3)\n\nSince the specified maximum modulation nonlinearity is\n1%, then the sensitivity at the extreme of this linear\nrange is\n\ns o\nS, =So - -- 1 - 0.01 = 0.99 rad/modulation unit (max)\n100\n(4)\nFrom Eqs.

Characteristics of amplitude modulator\n\nc. Modulator design (actzral). There are several factors\nthat cause the actual design to deviate from the ideal\ncase, such as:\n\n(1) The modulator diodes may be biased at a point that\ndoes not provide linear level changes.\n\nand from Eqs.

Figure 6\nshows a typical signal level versus modulation voltage\nfor the amplitude modulator. Point A on the curve\nindicates the bias for linear modulation as described in\nthe ideal case. B and C represent bias points that produce nonlinear amplitude variation with modulation\nvoltage. Assume the modulators are biased at point B and\nthat the modulation voltage increases the RF outputs of\nIvfl and hi12 by 1.1 but decreases them by only 0.9, causing a 10% amplitude linearity distortion. From Eq. (2)\n\nThus, biasing at point B on the curve shown in Fig. 6\ngreatly reduces the linear phase range.\nIf, on the other hand, the amplitude modulators are\nbiased at point C of Fig. 6 where the modulation voltage\nincreases the R F output by 0.9 but decreases them by 1.1,\nthen\n\n= 1rad/modulation unit\n\nS , = So---\n\n100\n\n(13)\n\n- 0.99 rad/modulation\n\n(14)\n\nunit\n\nat 1 % nonlinearity.

It was found that\nthe phase slope is not monotonic; however, at no point in\nthis region does the nonlinearity exceed 2 1 % . It can be\nshown that the same (-4) linearity is obtained when a\nnegative modulation voltage is applied.\nSelecting a nonlinear bias point C has increased the\nlinear range over the ideal case. This is a result of\ncompensating the nonlinear arctan function with the\nnonlinear characteristics of the anlplitude modulation.\nAnother contributing factor to nonideal perfornlance\nis the carrier phase delay change versus attenuation of\n\neach amplitude modulator, which constitutes approximately 15% of the total desired phase deviation. This\nphase shift is relatively linear over the operating amplitude range of the nlodulators of +1 dB and does not\ncontribute significantly to nonlinearity. The alignnlent\nprocedure assures that both the phase delay characteristics and the differences between the characteristics of\nthe modulators are conlpensated by selection of the\nproper bias.\nThe photographs in Fig. 7 show S-band phasen~odulationspectra (2110 MHz) using the new phase\nmodulator. In Fig. 7a the carrier has been suppressed\napproximately 2 dB, and in Fig. 7b the carrier has been\nnulled. In both cases the modulation signal was a\n100-KHz square wave with a rise and decay time of\n10 ns. The existence of even-order harmonics is partly\ndue to the rise time of the modulating signal. To obtain\nthe photographs, the 66-MHz output from the modulator\nnlodule was frequency-multiplied X32 using standard\nBlock I11 C S-band exciter subassen~blies.\n\nd . Conclusion. The use of amplitude modulation techniques to obtain a linear phase modulator has been\ndemonstrated. Nonlinearities of less than 1% up to an\nindex of 2.4 rad at S-band have been attained. The modulator itself has a bandwidth greater than +10 MHz and\ncan handle square-wave modulation signals up to 1MHz.\nHowever, in the present Block I11 C exciter, the bandwidth is limited by the frequency multiplier chain\nfollowing the modulator.\n4. 400-kW Transmitter Controls,\n\nR . 1. l e u\n\na. Introduction. The size and complexity of the 400-kW\ntransmitter system demands a larger and more reliable\ncontrol system. The new system uses solid-state discrete\nlogic and monitor circuits. The new control system for\nthe DSN 400-kW transmitter is under test at DSS 13 and\nis being static-tested in the laboratory. Preliminary testing\nof these circuits at DSS 13 proved them to be very\nsatisfactory.\n\nb. Control system. The control system is made up of\na master control and four auxiliary controls as shown in\nFig. 8. The system controls, monitors, and protects the\nklystron amplifier.

Control junction box. This unit is located in the\ntransforn~er/rectifier building north of the antenna. The\ncontrol J-box is used as a control distribution and interlock status accumulation center for all outside equipment\non the ground. The J-box contains a small logic chassis\nwith summing logic, lamp driver, and bistable circuits.\nInterlock faults are summed into major fault categories\nand sent to the local control. The J-box has fault display\nlamps to indicate the precise fault of the local equipment. The lamp drivers are used for turning on and off\nthe outside equipment on commands sent from the local\ncontrol console.\n\ne. Klystron instrumentation. The instrumentation cabinet will be located in the tri-cone with the klystron\namplifier. This assembly is used for control and moilitor\nof the 400-kW klystron amplifier. The control and interlock functions are: filament power, R F drive input,\ncoolant flow, vacuum power, detection of waveguide arcs,\nand excessive reflected power. The instrumentation\nassembly monitors the klystron RF output power, R F\nreflected power, RF input power, and coolant flow.\nf . Remote control. This unit is a transmitter system\nremote monitor with limited control. To operate the\ntransmitter from the remote control requires that all\nauxiliary power supplies and motor-generators have been\npreviously energized. The remote control design is such\nthat it can be completely disconnected from the system\nwithout affecting the operation, with one exception: for\nsafety purposes a safe-run key interlock is in series with\nthe beam voltage on circuitry. The remote control is a\nself-contained unit and has a control logic assembly\nconsisting of 15 lamp drivers, one bistable circuit, and a\nseparate dc control power supply. This design then\nallows the remote cabinet to be placed several thousand\nfeet from the local control and still function properly.\n-\n\nTo improve the system reliability and performance,\nsolid-state logic has been designed for the interlock,\ncontrol, and monitor functions. The relay interlock logic\npresently used in transmitter systems is being replaced\nby digital and-gate circuitry. The relay function used to\nilluminate fault and status lamps is being replaced by\nlamp driuers. The on-of control functions are being\nreplaced by bistable circuitry. The logic units are designed to operate on an input signal between 15 and\n30 Vdc. There are several additional advantages to using\nsolid-state logic as opposed to relay logic. The size of the\ntotal logic chassis is about %o the size of the existing\nrelay assembly; power to energize the logic is 1/20 that\nrequired for relays; and the logic is more accessible for\nmaintenance and trouble shooting.\nMonitoring circuits to drive meters at remote locations\nhave been designed, utilizing integrated differential\namplifiers. These circuits are being used in the 450-kW\ntransmitter at DSS 13 and have operated without failure\nor problems for the past 4 mo. The new design gives\nmore reliable meter readings at the remote locations,\ndecreased drift with temperature changes, and can be\nJPk SPACE PRQGRAMS SUMMARY 37-60, VQL. 11\n\nThis unit has been tested at DSS 13 for 30 days in the\nR&D 450-kW transmitter system.

Control wiring, which is\nfabricated and on site, will be installed by the electrical\ncontractor. The alidade (water-to-water) pumping unit\nwill be mounted on the antenna. Subsystem level testing\nwill be done.\n6. DSIF Monitor System Phase I Development,\n\nR. Flanders\n\nThe DSIF Monitor System Phase I (DSIF MS0I) provides the DSSs in the DSIF with a capability for monitoring the performance and alarm status of the various\nsubsystems within each station. A record is also maintained on magnetic tape for postmission analysis, and\nreal-time status and alarm messages prepared for transmission to the SFOF via high-speed data line.\nThe DSIF MS0I consists of a hardware segment\ncomposed of the Digital Instrumentation Subsystem\nPhase I1 (DIS 11) and the station monitor and control\nconsole (SMC), together with a software segment represented by the DSIF M S 0 I program running in the\nDIS 1 .\n1\n\n1\n\nThe current effort involves the update of both the\nhardware and software, in order to provide monitor\nsupport for Mariner Mars 1971 and subsequent missions.\nHardware development has been initiated to implement\nsix stations (DSSs 12,14,41,51,62, and the Cape Kennedy\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-60, VOL. 11\n\n(5) High-speed data input/output registers.\n\n(6) Control logic.\nData communication between the display equipment\nand the DIS I1 will be serial by bit via the high-speed\ndata register and will be transmitted at rates of up to\n50 kilobits/s. A keyboard on the terminal will provide\nfor manual data entry and for addressing the display\nformat of specific interest.\nThe principal effort in the software development involves the extension of the existing DSIF MS0I program. The present version was implemented on an interim\nbasis for support of Mariner Mars 1969. As such, it\noffered considerably less than the full Phase I monitor\ncapability. The version of the MS0I program to be\nimplemented for Mariner Mars 1971 will contain routines\nfor angle and range data processing, which were deleted\nfrom the present version due to core memory limitations.\nIn addition, the program will provide for output to a\ngraphical (X-Y) plotter for recording and displaying\ncritical parameters. Typical parameters to be plotted as\na function of time would include signal strength (AGC),\nstatic phase error, signal-to-noise ratio, transmitter power\noutput, system temperature, and pseudoresiduals for\ndoppler, angles, and range.\nThe program will also contain the capability to process data for display on the CRT and to output various\ndisplay formats under operator control (addressable from\nthe SMC display terminal keyboard). A revision of the\npresent system for processing monitor criterion data\n(MCD) sets is also under consideration to reduce the\nvolume and variations of MCD and provide for their\ndefinition at the individual DSS. The capacity for receiving and processing MCD, tracking, and RF predicts\nby way of high-speed data inbound to the station also\noffers a new capability.\nThe content of the high-speed data periodic and alarm\nmessages to the SFOF is also under study, to investigate\n\nthe possibility of returning higher resolution data. The\nlarger high-speed data block (1200 bits instead of 600\nbits), together with a possibility for higher transmission\nrates may result in a redefinition of the DSN periodic\nand alarm messages.\nThe program will also be required to process monitor\ndata from subsystems and equipment newly implemented\nfor Mariner Mars 1971 support. This will include additional telemetry and command functions, and frequency\nand timing subsystem phase I1 (FTS 11) monitor input\nparameters, when available.\nThe monitor functions within the DSS are also being\nredefined to be of greater value to station personnel for\nDSIF performance and alarm monitoring. The operational experience gained through use of the DSIF monitor system during the Mariner Mars 1969 missions will\nbe reflected in these changes. Greater flexibility and control over alarm parameters to be displayed and the\nmanner in which they are displayed will be provided at\nthe station level. The means for calling up and displaying\nformats containing specific parameters will allow operational personnel to monitor critical parameters in greater\ndetail than previously possible.\nIn summary, the DSIF monitor system phase I hardware is being extended, and the software is undergoing\nan extensive revision to process the new monitor functions to be implemented for Mariner Mars 1971 and increase the value of the monitor system to the DSIF by\nincorporating the experience gained in support of Mariner\nMars 1969.\n7 . Frequency and Timing Subsystem, Phase 11, M. Golifzen\n\nFor the past year the frequency and timing subsystem\nat DSSs 14, 41, 51, and 62 has been in a hybrid configuration referred to as FTS 1/11. This configuration was\nnecessary because of problems in the use of commercial\nequipment. The FTS I1 configuration required two commercially built isolation amplifiers for signal distribution.\nThe digital isolation amplifier (DIA) exhibited bit pickup,\nbit dropout, and oscillation problems. The precision\nfrequency isolation amplifier exhibited amplitude modulation, low isolation, spurious signals, and other lesser\nproblems.\nDuring the past months these problems have been\nunder investigation, and steps have been taken to correct\n\nthem. The DIA design has been changed, and the first\nreworked unit has been returned from the vendor. This\nunit was tested at JPL by connecting the FTS I1 outputs\nto the DIA. The DIA outputs were then connected\nthrough an FTS junction module to a load bank. Through\none of the junction modules parallel outputs, monitor\npoints were connected. Data from the points was recorded on a strip chart recorder.\nNo failures of the DIA were detected during this testing. This unit is now at DSS 14 where it has been installed\nin the FTS racks. At this time preliminary tests have\nrevealed no problems with the DIA. On three separate\nshifts the FTS I1 configuration was connected, and the\nDIA\'s performance was flawless. At the end of these test\nperiods the station was restored to the FTS 1/11 configuration for operational use. Further FTS I1 testing at\nDSS 14 will be undertaken before an effort is made to\nconvert to the FTS I1 system operation on a permanent\nbasis.\nThe precision frequency isolation amplifiers have been\nunder investigation at JPL and at the standards laboratory at the Goldstone DSCC. These performance tests\nhave verified that the amplifiers under test have been\nimproved by the vendor. One of the units has been tested\nat DSS 12. The tests were accomplished by observing\nthe stations\' operation with and without the amplifier in\nthe operations loop. Future evaluations are necessary\nbefore these units can be used.\nThe auxiliary reference divider and its control panel\nhave been installed at DSS 14. The auxiliary divider is\na working spare to the FTS I1 reference timing pulse\ngenerator. In the present configuration the spare divider\nprovides a 1-pulse/s back-up pulse to the FTS standard\n1 pulse/s. The standard FTS 1-pulse/s signal is clocked\nfrom signals derived from the FTS primary frequency\nstandard. The auxiliary divider now provides an additional 1 pulse/s which is clocked from a secondary frequency standard.\nThe control panel for the auxiliary divider provides a\nmeans of synchronizing the auxiliary divider\'s 1 pulse/s\noutput to the FTS primary 1 pulse/s signal. In addition\nthe auxiliary reference divider control panel provides\nstatus indications on the 1-MHz secondary signal used to\ndrive the auxiliary reference divider. At present it is\nplanned to install this auxiliary system as DSSs 12, 41,\n51, and 62 when these stations are converted to the\nFTS I1 configuration.\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-60, VOL. I1\n\n8. Analog Recording Flutter Sensitivity Tests,\n-\n\nJ. P. Buffinston\n\nIn SPS 37-58, Vol. 11, pp. 127-129, it was shown that\nthe primary source of the data degradation in the teiemetry recording subsystem is time displacement error\n(TDE). This was deduced from the shape of the constant 1-dB data loss flutter amplitude FA versus flutter\nfrequency curves. The relationship\nTDE = (FA)/w cos oT\n(where is the angular velocity of the flutter component)\nwas developed, and initial steps have been taken to\noptimize the recording subsystem.\nThat amount of TDE which results in-a 1-dB data loss\ncan be computed by taking values of FA and w off the\ndata curves in the referenced article and substituting\nthem in the equation above. Table 1gives the permissible\nTDE for three subcarriers and their corresponding data\nrates.\n\nthe bandwidth of the capstan servo and in the use of\nvacuum columns in the tape path to provide isolation\nfrom reel disturbances. The following schematic drawings illustrate the differences in the two mechanical tape\ntransports. The relatively large diameter of the capstan\non the FR 1600 facilitates reducing the length of magnetic tape between the capstan and the magnetic reproduce heads, which makes possible the relatively wide\ncapstan servo bandwidth (Fig. 12).\nThe FR 1600 transport, when used as a subcarrier\nrecorder-reproducer does, in fact, hold the TDE to a low\nenough value to allow the SDA to lock on to the reproduced data without any external flutter and/or TDE\ncorrection. The results (exclusive of conversion losses)\nare given in Table 3.\nTable 3. TDE measurements for FR 1600 transport\nSubcarrier\n\nTape speed,\n\nfrequency, kHz\n\nin./s\n\nSTn/No after\n\nTable 1.

I1\n\nThese results were obtained with the capstan reference\nrecorded on the adjacent track to the data in the same\nhead stack. Tests indicate that the TDE of the FR 1600\nis about four times as great under these conditions as it\nis between the local reference and the recorded reference\ntrack. A method of multiplexing the recorded reference in\nwith the recorded subcarrier to take advantage of this\nimprovement is being investigated in the laboratory at\nthis time (Fig. 13).\nIt would appear that substantial improvements in the\nTDE of longitudinal recorders will be effected in the future, though in smaller increments and at great difficulty\nbecause of limitations in the supporting technology (e.g.,\ngrinding, machining, bearings, as well as the electromechanical components such as motors, etc.). As a result,\nelectronic flutter and TDE correction methods are being\nstudied in an effort to further optimize the recording\nsubsystem. A block diagram of a TDE correction system\nthat has been used with considerable success with rotary\nhead transports is shown in Fig. 14.\nIn this system, a pilot tone from the local reference is\nmultiplexed with the data and then separated out with\ncomb filters and the reproduced pilot tone is again com149\n\nF 1600\nR\n\nF 1400\nR\n\nHEADS\n\nHEADS\n\n\\-\n\n9.

The 1750-hp motor generator set at\nDSS 13 is used to supply 400-Hz primary power to the\n70-kV high-voltage power supply. I t is important that\nthe motor be operated at unity power factor so that the\nincoming power line is affected as little as possible by\nload conditioils at DSS 13. This minimizes interaction\nbetween facilities at Goldstoile DSCC, improves voltage\nregulation, and reduces power costs. Power-factor correction may be accomplished by adjusting field current\nin the syl~chrollousmotor. Originally, the power factor\nwas coiltrolled by a carbon pile regulator. The operation\nof the carbon pile regulator depends upon sensing lowline voltage caused by the high-line current associated\nwith low-power factor. However, the iilconlillg line to\nDSS 13 was of such low impedance that the line voltage\nwas not sufficiently affected by low-power factor so the\npower factor correction did not operate reliably. During\nthe start cycle the synchrollous motor is acting as a generator whose output is controlled by field current. I t is,\ntherefore, possible to match the voltage output of the\nmotor with the illcoming line voltage. In the original\nillstallatioll no provisions were made for matching the\nline and motor voltage. The result was that the motor\'s\nprotective circuitry prevented syllchronization until man-\n\nI\n\nVOLTAGE VARIABLE DELAY LINE\n\nI\n\'\n\nDATA\nOUT\n\nCOMB FILTER\nTUNED TO\n\nI\n\nREFERENCE\nIOCAL\n\nFig. 14.

However, the operation of this unit was not\nsatisfactory because of errors in the order of 5% when\nthe islotor was lightly loaded.\n\nb. Description of new unit. A new control was designed,\nbreadboarded, and installed at DSS 13. This control contains line-motor voltage matching circuitry (Fig. 15), and\na digital phase detector (Fig. 16) for power-factor control after the motor is brought on the line.\nThe line-motor voltage matching section of the motor\nfield control contains a voltage transducer, which is a fullwave bridge that is linearized by the use of a small value\nof resistance in parallel with the output resistance. A\ntransducer is used on both the line and motor voltages.\nThe dc voltage output of these transducers is then applied to a voltage comparator circuit whose output\ncontrols the motor field-power supply.\nThe power factor section of the motor field control\nconsists of a digital phase detector, which samples the\nmotor current and motor-voltage phase relationship. The\noutput of the phase detector is zero at unity power factor,\n\nLINE VOLTAGE\n\nTRANSDUCER\nTO MOTOR\nFIELD SUPPLY\n\nMOTOR VOLTAGE\nMOTOR\nTRANSDUCER\n\nFig. 15.

Laboratory tests of the\nphase detector showed an accuracy of +-0.5% at worstcase conditions.\nThe original breadboard has been in operation at\nDSS 13 in the S-band system for approximately 1yr with\nno failures. A prototype (Fig. 17) has been built and\ninstalled in the X-band clock synchronization transmitter\nsystem of DSS 13. Operation of this unit has been satisfactory for about three months.\nc.
