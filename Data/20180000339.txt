The project called\nfor a report that would describe airship concepts proposed or projects initiated, airship performance or\ncapability targets, and the missions these activities were addressing. It would detail the principal\ntechnical features of these airships; the proposed value/advantages of the features, notional concepts\nof operation, and challenges associated with the vehicles. Also investigated would be the current status\nand near-term prospects of these airship development activities, whether they are active or, if curtailed\nthe circumstances and possible reasons for that conclusion including technical, business, or other\nmitigating factors. For the most active programs an assessment would be conducted to identify the\nresources or activities required for airships to advance to series construction and operational\ndeployment. The study would also identify impediments to these developments and deployments, with\nrecommendations provided to address existing issues in the airship industry today.\nThe study was begun with an initial survey of recent and current airship efforts (over the past ten years)\nincluding organizations, customer markets; missions; concepts proposed or projects initiated; technical\nfeatures, performance or capability targets; concepts of operation (CONOPS) and program status\n(whether active or inactive). A two month information search of publicly available information was\nconducted of the principal airship and aerostat companies and design organizations. Data was gathered\non almost forty organizations, and organized into a common set of categories. These included:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nCustomer Markets & Missions\nAirship Concepts & Vehicles - Technical Features, Performance or Capability Targets\nKey Technology Elements\nConcept of Operations (CONOPS)\nCompany/Program Status\n\nTo provide a technical and operational context to readers of this report a section on Airship Basics was\ncompiled to describe how airships are designed, constructed, and their operational aspects. Subject\nareas included:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nBuoyancy\nLifting gases\nPayload to Frame Weight Ratio\nGas Management\nTemperature Effects\nAirspeed\nFuel consumption vs speed and range\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n1\n\nThe Green Airship\nBuoyancy Management\nGround Handling, Mooring, and Landing\nSystems\nAirship Hangars\nMaintenance Philosophies\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAirship Certification and Operations\nRegulations\n\nAn engineering level assessment was undertaken of the airship vehicle classes, designs, and\ntechnologies identified in the survey. Their capabilities and challenges to meet a set of notional cargo\ntransport scenarios were highlighted. Also identified were new or enabling technology advances\nnecessary for successful development of the transport airship industry; and principal lessons learned\nfrom the industry. This section organized information drawn from the Industry Survey and combined it\ninto several airship related technology categories. These include:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nHull Configurations\nSolid Structures\nFabrics\nPropulsion and vectored thrust\nBuoyancy Compensation\nFlight Controls\nTakeoff & Landing Gear and Mooring Systems\nCargo Handling Systems\nAlternative Lifting Gases to Helium\nDevelopment of New or Enabling Technology Advances\n\nFive cargo airship scenarios were proposed. They were not comprehensive and several additional\nscenarios could be envisioned, but the ones chosen cover the majority of typical cargo airship\napplications and CONOPS. In the absence of specific performance and operational requirements a set of\ngeneral capabilities for cargo airships was offered as a guide for subsequent evaluation of current and\nnear term cargo airship technologies.

The sources and users of those tools were identified along with the capabilities, strengths\nand weaknesses of each tool as they apply to lighter-than-air vehicles. A gap analysis was conducted to\ndelineate further tool development that is required to meet the needs of current and future airship\ndesign efforts and the technologies involved in those efforts.\nObservations\nThe study identified a nascent but challenged airship industry and identified several factors that have\nbeen and continue to be obstacles to the emergence of an industry capable of constructing viable\ntransport airships:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nProfound underestimation of program funding required\nOveroptimistic assessments of available development or investment funds\nSevere and chronic underfunding of airship programs from initiation to ultimate financial\ncollapse\nOverestimation and overselling of the airship\xe2\x80\x99s performance, capabilities, and operational costs\nPoor technical and financial management practices by start-up airship developers\nShortage of designers and engineers with unique airship skills\nInsufficient customer understanding or influence on airship requirements, design, or CONOPS\nExcessively short or unachievable development schedules set by customers or investors\nCustomers and investors unwillingness to risk corporate funding or reputation on airship\ndevelopment\nUnbridgeable gap between customer expectations and airship capabilities\nInvestor or customer impatience with:\no Airship development time and cost outlays\no Staged development of sub-scale or interim sized airships to establish technical\nknowledge base\no Roadmap for specific airship technology R&D efforts to reduce principal program risks\nSchedule delay or increased costs due to unanticipated technical obstacles\nCutting corners with technical development processes or airship design to save money or\nshorten schedule\nUnfamiliarity by aviation certification authorities with factors governing airship design, and\noperation\nInadequate or non-existent regulations governing airship design, development, certification, and\noperation\nUnderestimation of certification impacts on development schedule and costs\n\nNumber 1 Reason: Lack of certitude that the airship company could build the airship that was proposed.\n\n4\n\nRecommendations\nA comprehensive set of airship operational modeling tools is needed that is flexible enough to capture\nthe various inputs of any proposed airship operational market, application, or mission. The set of\nmodeling tools would need to be user friendly enough to allow airship developers (and their end\ncustomers) to easily work with the tool developers to quickly identify the airship performance\nrequirements for the preferred operational scenario. This robust set of modeling tools must also enable\ninvestigation of the basic airship design, principal sub-systems and how they inter-relate into a platform\nthat can achieve the full airship performance features. These tools need to model the airship\xe2\x80\x99s\naerodynamics, structures, propulsion systems, landing systems, flight controls, gas management, ground\nhandling, maintenance, and cargo handling systems with opportunities for introduction of new\ntechnologies or design approaches within each. This tool set would be of more immediate value to the\nairship designers who could utilize it in refining their current designs, or in responding with a new design\nthat could meet the airship requirements that the operational model could generate.\nThere is a small but steadily growing airship development industry which is in need of world class airship\nmodeling and simulation investigations for airship designs, manufacture, and operations. The\ncommunity of interested potential airship users is also expanding but their commitment of funds toward\nairship utilization is being withheld due to the lack of comprehensive data on the viability of airship\ntechnologies and airship operational cost/effectiveness. NASA Ames is in a prime position to provide the\ncritical modeling and simulation investigations needed to unlock the great potential of the airship\nindustry, especially for its end-users.\n\n5\n\n'
