b"Rocket astronomy\nThe discipline that makes use of sounding rockets (Fig. 1) that fly near-vertical paths carrying scientific\ninstruments to altitudes ranging from 25 to more than 900 mi (40 to 1500 km). Altitudes up to 30 mi (48\nkm) can be reached by balloons, so sounding rockets are typically used for higher altitudes in order to\nmeasure sources with telescopes or particles and fields in space with in situ observations that do not\npenetrate the Earth's atmosphere. Sounding rockets do not achieve escape velocity; after completion of\nthe launch phase, the payload follows a ballistic trajectory that permits 5\xe2\x80\x9315 min of data taking before\nreentry. See ROCKET.\n\nFig. 1 Launch of a NASA Black Brant XII sounding rocket. (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)\n\nMission profile.\nSuborbital rocket astronomy began in the United States in 1946, using captured German V-2 rockets\nwith no pointing capability and very simple instrumentation. A typical modern launch is comparatively\nsophisticated, involving multiple stages of engine ignition, vehicle spinup to inhibit tumbling, payload\nseparation and thruster firing to control or eliminate the experiment from spinning, target acquisition if the\nexperiment is remote sensing, attitude control system (ACS) operation, telemetry and data command via\nthe ground station. For payloads that are to be recovered, the mission also completes door closure or\nboom retraction, reentry and chute deployment, impact and recovery, and reuse of the scientific payload.\n\nIn comparison with experiments launched on satellites, rockets offer the advantages of simplicity of\nmission design, low mission cost, and rapid response to unique observing opportunities. Several science\ndisciplines now routinely utilize the suborbital rocket, including Astronomy, Heliophysics, Geospace, and\nPlanetary, and these diverse science disciplines have extended the types of experiments performed\nusing rockets to remote sensing instruments (telescopes) and in-situ measurements. Benefiting from\nrelatively frequent access to launch opportunities, an experimental payload can be launched once per\nyear, if retrieved, in Heliophysics or Astrophysics or multiple launches per year in Geospace and\nPlanetary experiments. The suborbital missions have a shorter time scale from conception to launch, 3\xe2\x80\x93\n5 years for a suborbital rocket versus 5\xe2\x80\x9320 years for satellites or experiments on the International Space\nStation. The suborbital payloads are lower cost than satellite-based instruments, and a suborbital flight\nallows recoverability of the payload and the possibility of postflight instrument calibration, refurbishment,\nand reflight. NASA currently launches roughly 20 suborbital missions per year. The major disadvantages\nare short observing time, minutes versus months or years for satellites; localized coverage, with\nobservations restricted to a celestial hemisphere or region of space over the launch site; and size and\nweight restrictions on payloads.\nThe United States, Canada, Japan, and many European countries, including Germany, France, Sweden,\nNorway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, maintain scientific rocket programs.\n\nNearly a dozen different launch vehicles are in common use (Fig. 2), ranging in length from 10 to 65 ft (3\nto 20 m) and in diameter from 4.5 to 22 in. (11 to 56 cm). Payloads up to 2200 lb (1000 kg) can be\ncarried to altitudes that are typical of those at which the space shuttle operates, 150\xe2\x80\x93200 mi (250\xe2\x80\x93320\nkm). For each launch vehicle the maximum altitude is strongly dependent upon payload weight (Fig. 3).\nFor instance, the Black Brant X can carry a 200-lb (91-kg) payload to an altitude of 620 mi (1000 km)\nand can boost an 800-lb (364-kg) payload to 250 mi (400 km).\n\nFig. 2 Current NASA sounding rockets. (NASA Sounding Rockets Projects Office, Wallops Flight Facility)\n\nFig. 3 Lift capability of NASA sounding rockets. Apogee is shown as function of payload weight.\n\nSounding rockets are routinely launched in the United States from Wallops Island, Virginia; Poker Flats\nResearch Range, Alaska; and White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. Sites in Australia, Norway,\nSweden, Canada, Peru and Brazil are also used. Temporary launch ranges are arranged when needed,\nand scientific requirements may dictate heavy usage of a particular facility. This was the case in 1988\nand 1989 when numerous observations of Supernova 1987a were carried out from Woomera, in\nAustralia. The United States sounding rocket program makes extensive use of surplus military rockets as\nan economical source of engines. NASA's Orion was formerly a Hawk ground-to-air missile, while Nike,\nTaurus, and Terrier engines are used as boosters in two- and three-stage flights. These components are\nusually supplied without guidance control systems.\n\nHeliophysics rocket astronomy.\nSolar Astronomy\nThe Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths shorter than ~300 nanometers. Observations in the\nultraviolet and x-ray regions of the spectrum therefore require that instruments be placed at altitudes\nexceeding 25\xe2\x80\x9387 mi (40\xe2\x80\x93140 km), depending upon wavelength. The outer portion of the Sun's\natmosphere, the corona, is at a substantially higher temperature than is the photosphere, several million\nkelvins versus 6000 K. The emission from this region is dominated by ultraviolet and x-ray photons,\nwhose total luminosity is very weak in comparison to the Sun's visible light output because of the\nextremely low density of the corona. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, techniques were developed\nfor focusing x-rays and thereby providing direct imaging of the corona. These early studies revealed the\nhighly structured nature of the atmosphere, with approximately semicircular loops of hot plasma outlining\nthe shape of the magnetic field threading the hot gas. Areas of the solar surface at which strong\nmagnetic fields emerge are known as active regions; in addition to producing strong x-ray and ultraviolet\nemission, they are the sites of explosive solar flare events. In such events the plasma is temporarily\nheated to temperatures exceeding 107 K by the rapid release of stored magnetic energy; in addition,\nmaterial is often ejected into interplanetary space. These solar energetic events also produce bursts of\nhigh-energy particles, microwave emission, and gamma rays. The radiation, ejected plasma and\nmagnetic field that intercepts the Earth disrupts the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetosphere and ionosphere \xe2\x80\x93 a so called\n\xe2\x80\x9cmagnetic storm\xe2\x80\x9d. See X-RAY TELESCOPE.\n\nAmong the notable advances in coronal studies from rockets has been the development of a new\ntechnique for x-ray imaging, with concomitant improvements in imaging spectroscope methods. The\nfabrication of multilayer coatings for enhanced x-ray reflectivity may be viewed as depositing an artificial\nBragg crystal onto a figured substrate. This technique offers the advantage of substantially higher image\nsharpness, and provides simultaneous spectroscopy because of the narrow x-ray bandwidth of the\ncoatings. The major technological limitation of this technique is the inability to produce adequate normalincidence reflectivity at short wavelengths (less than 1 nm); in this spectral region, grazing-incidence\nmethods continue to be the most appropriate. Heliophysics suborbital missions are also now used to\ncalibrate satellite-borne instruments such as the Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) on\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Solar Dynamics Observatory. Similar calibration missions are expected for the Radiation Belt\nStorm Probes that will study the radiation belts of the Earth. See SUN; X-RAY DIFFRACTION.\n\nGEOSPACE\nThe transition between the terrestrial atmosphere and near-Earth space occurs in the lower portion of\nionosphere/thermosphere/mesosphere (ITM) region or Geospace, between 60 and 180 km. This region,\nwhich is largely unexplored, is an important link in the chain that connects the Sun to the Earth. The\nregion is characterized by complex coupling between the ionized plasma in the ionosphere, the neutral\natmosphere of the thermosphere and mesosphere, and electric fields, currents, and charged particles\nimposed from above by the magnetosphere. Little is known about the physical processes that operate in\nthis region because of its relative inaccessibility: the region between maximum balloon altitudes (~40\nkm) and minimum satellite altitudes (~150 km) is accessible only to sounding rockets. The region is a\ncomplex one, which encompasses the mesosphere, its upper boundary, the mesopause, and the\ntransition into the lower thermosphere. The relative inaccessibility of these regions has resulted in\nserious gaps in our knowledge of this portion of the upper atmosphere, which is particularly frustrating\nbecause this is just where the heating rate due to absorption of solar EUV and UV radiation peaks.\nCarefully conceived sounding rocket experiments carrying particles and fields instruments to very high\naltitudes (> 1000 km) at high latitudes have unveiled new classes of natural acceleration phenomena,\nwhile shedding light on several critical aspects of the general question of how electrons and ions are\naccelerated in space. NASA sounding rocket experiments have, for instance discovered and/or explored\nin unprecedented detail several new plasma physics phenomena, including intense Langmuir waves\nassociated with field-aligned electron bursts, the relationship of perpendicular ion beams to lower hybrid\nwave bursts, flickering aurora and extremely low frequency waves, and bursty field-aligned electron\nfluxes. Future rockets involving a number of sub-payloads that are spaced only a few hundred meters\napart will address important questions concerning the spatial and temporal variations of these\nphenomena, as well as collect the data necessary to understanding the relationship between auroral\nmicrophysics and larger scale dynamics.\xc2\xa0See\n\nIONOSPHERE; MAGNETOSPHERE\n\nOther celestial sources.\nObservations of nonsolar sources from sounding rockets encounter two major difficulties: the low\nintensity of the emission and the technological problem of pointing the payload at the source during the\nflight. The two problems are related in that the low flux levels generally lead to a requirement for long\nexposure or integration times, and the faintness of the source leads to difficulty in constructing a sensor\nthat can provide the appropriate detection signal to an attitude control system. The development of a\n\ngas-jet attitude control system for Aerobee rockets in 1964 and the addition of gyroscopic stabilization in\n1965 permitted ultraviolet spectroscopy of stars with high enough dispersion to record interstellar\nabsorption features in the 130\xe2\x80\x93160-nm range. Such data permit measurement of interstellar hydrogen,\ncarbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, and sulfur. Spectra in the 100\xe2\x80\x93250-nm region permit studies of stars\nwith surface temperatures of 10,000\xe2\x80\x9330,000 K; in addition to total-luminosity determination, a major\ndiscovery from line-profile measurements of hot-star absorption features was the finding that such stars\nhave large mass loss due to high-velocity (greater than 600 mi/s or 103 km/s) stellar winds. In 1970, a\nsounding rocket detected the absorption line of interstellar molecular hydrogen; this detection was the\nforerunner of later extensive studies from the Copernicus satellite, which have had a major impact on the\nfield of interstellar chemistry. See ASTRONOMICAL SPECTROSCOPY; COSMOCHEMISTRY; INTERSTELLAR\nMATTER; SPACECRAFT PROPULSION; ULTRAVIOLET ASTRONOMY.\n\nIn 1962, a rocket experiment detected nonsolar x-rays for the first time from within the constellation\nScorpius, at a level many orders of magnitude higher than would be produced by an equivalently placed\nsolar-strength source. The observer, Riccardo Giacconi, won the Nobel prize in 2002, in part, for this\nsuborbital rocket observation. Subsequent flights confirmed the initial result and discovered other x-ray\nsources, as well as a diffuse x-ray background and an emission source in the Crab Nebula. The field of\nx-ray astronomy is now dominated by observations from satellites such as Chandra, XMM-Newton, and\nFermi, which have the ability to carry out all-sky surveys and to integrate for many hours in order to\nstudy low-intensity sources. See X-RAY ASTRONOMY.\nMicrogravity\nThe use of sounding rockets by the US microgravity community is just beginning: the first NASA\nmicrogravity sounding rocket experiment flew in October 1994. Rocket contributions to studies of the\neffects of microgravity on fluid dynamics and combustion are expected to be quite important. Studies of\nthe process of combustion under conditions of microgravity, for instance, are important both for\nunderstanding the fundamental physics of the process and in preparing for habitation of the Space\nStation. Fundamental advances in understanding can arise from such studies because buoyancy is one\nof the dominant effects in flame spreading; the microgravity environment eliminates this force from the\nequation thus enabling details of flame spreading to be studied in a simpler situation.\n\nJonathan Cirtain\n\nBibliography.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Proceedings of the 7th Conference on Sounding\nRockets, Balloons, and Related Space Systems, 1986;\nG.
