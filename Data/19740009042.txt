INTRODUCTION\nMost display systems do not have a memory capability; data are usually\nstored in a buffer memory which continually refreshes the display. This is a\nvery inefficient arrangement; a buffer memory with a capacity of the order of\none million bits is an expensive piece of equipment. A much better system\nwould be one wherein the display has an intrinsic memory capability (or viceversa). The object of the contract effort described in the main body of this\nreport was the utilization of unique properties of recently developed RCA\ncathodochromic materials to create such a combined memory and display (or MAD)\ndevice.\nIt is well known that cathodochromic materials store and display information; images colored into cathodochromic materials persist for times ranging\nfrom minutes to many hours after storage. This in itself is useful. However,\na true memory must have the capability to recall stored information in some\nuseful signal form. Under the present contract fast phosphors and cathodochromic materials have been successfully combined in such a way that information stored in the cathodochromic is optically detected to generate an output\nelectronic video signal. Thus, the "buffer memory-display" problem is solved\nand a device with very unique capabilities which might be exploited in\nnumerous other applications is developed.\n\n1\n\nBASIC PRINCIPLES AND DESIGN GOALS\nII.\nThe cathodochromic storage device is a low-cost, large-capacity memory\nand display unit built around a cathode-ray tube (CRT) wherein a fast phosphor\nin\nlayer is combined with a cathodochromic material as shown schematically\nhas the property that it undergoes a\nFigure 1.

Powders of sodalite:Cl cathodochromic material, for example, are\nnormally white; under electron beam bombardment a red coloration corresponding\nto an induced absorption band at 5200 X is generated (Figure 2). The induced\noptical density is proportional to the electron beam exposure, and the coloration persists after the electron beam is removed. Therefore, a CRT electron\nbeam modulated by a video signal as it scans a normal TV raster, stores a\ncolored image in the sodalite powder layer. Viewed in reflected light, the\nstored image is a highly visible display. The presence of a fast phosphor\nlayer which emits at the wavelength of the induced cathodochromic absorption\n(Figure 2) makes it possible to recover the stored information in the form of\nreconstituted electronic video signal. A small constant current electron beam\nscans the storage raster and the phosphor layer emits uniformly; the radiation\nemitted at any given point on the screen is absorbed by the image in the\ncathodochromic layer in direct proportion to the local induced optical density.\n\n2\n\n-\n\nSODALITE !

The net result is a\nphotoerasable display storage device with electronic readout capabilities, or\nin other words a photoerasable "memory and display" (MAD) device.\nIt is quite obvious that cathodochromic MAD CRT\'s might be used in many\ndifferent ways. For example, computer-generated data might be stored for display and inspection; if further processing is deemed desirable the data might\nIn this application binary storage with\nbe read and returned to the computer.\nreliable recovery of each bit of stored information is essential.

In such telemetry situations, high speed storage and good gray-scale\nIn computer-assisted design, coherent optical\nreproduction are essential.\nprocessing, and numerous other applications the prime characteristics or requirements might again be different.

The methods and techniques employed\nachieved are described in the following sections of this report.-\n\n4\n\nIll. THE MAD CATHODOCHROMIC TUBES\nThe design goals and other pertinent factors impose several competing requirements on the bottle and gun assembly to be used in the cathodochromic\nstorage device [see First Quarterly Report (1)]. The best available means of\nmeeting these conflicting requirements is found in the gun and bottle of the\nRCA 5ZP16 flying-spot scanner tube. This is a 5-inch tube with electrostatic\nfocussing, magnetic deflection, and a 40. deflection angle. It can safely\noperate at voltages up to 27 kV and beam currents up to 400 vA; at 400 pA the\nfocussed beam spot diameter is approximately 140 U. This is compatible with\n500 x 500 line storage (2.5 x 105 bits) on a 3-inch x 4-inch raster where each\nbit has dimensions of 155 p x 200 p.\nThe materials chosen for the cathodochromic and phosphor layers were\nrespectively sodalite:Cl and yttrium aluminum garnet doped with cerium. Sodalite:Cl is an aluminosilicate material having the composition Na8Al6 Si60 2 4 C12 \'\nAppropriately prepared powders of this material are both photochromic and\ncathodochromic; the normally white powder develops an absorption band at 5200 Z\n(Figure 2) either when exposed to UV. radiation in the 2500 to 3900 1 region or\nwhen exposed to high energy cathode rays (electrons). Cathodochromic coloration at 27 kV requires exposures of approximately 0.2 microcoulomb per cm2 ,\nthat is, an incident energy of approximately 5.4 mjoules/cm 2 . The absorbed\nlight energy required for optical erasure of stored images is approximately\n10 times larger. Sodalite:Cl cathodochromic material was chosen for the\ncathodochromic storage device system because it yields the high visibility\nimages required of a good display and, moreover, the induced absorption band\nis relatively sharp, thereby permitting the use of a ratio-recording technique\ndiscussed in Section IV of this report. [The experience gained in the present\neffort suggests that other more recently developed cathodochromic materials\nmight offer some advantages in future MAD CRT\'s (Section 8).]\nThe phosphor in the cathodochromic storage device is required to have\nefficient emission overlapping the induced cathodochromic absorption band.\nMoreover, the phosphor emission decay time must be less than the time required\nfor the scanning electron beam to travel from one stored bit of information\nto the next; at TV scan rates this implies an emission decay time of 0.1 sec\nor less. Early in the present effort we showed that yttrium aluminum garnet\n(YAG) doped with trivalent cerium (Y Al5 0 1 2 :Ce 3+) is a phosphor which admirably\n3\nfulfills these requirements. The emission spectrum of this phosphor is shown\nin Figure 2. Other YAG:Ce characteristics were described in the First\nQuarterly Report [1].\nThe design goals for the cathodochromic storage device placed difficult\nand somewhat incompatible requirements on the composition of the cathodochromic\nand phosphor layers. For example, fast (1/30 sec) writing on the cathodochromic layer implies that the backing phosphor layer should not appreciably\nattenuate the electron beam and, furthermore, the phosphor emission during\nwriting should not appreciably bleach the cathodochromic. This would seem to\nindicate that the thickness (or screen weight) of the phosphor layer should\n\n5\n\nrequires an easily detected noisebe very small.

Obviously, the thickness of the phosphor layer\nfulfill all of these conflicting requirements, and some compromise thickness\nitself must be a compromise\nmust be used. Similarly, the cathodochromic layer\nlayer and a finer lower-contrast layer capable\nbetween a coarse high-contrast\nsort the optimum compromise\nof high resolution. In all conflicts of this\nsolution is that which permits the closest approach to the design goals. The\nstorage tube\nexperiments performed in order to determine the cathodochromic\nwere discussed in considerable\nparameters corresponding to optimum compromises\ndetail in the Second Quarterly Report.

Better than\n400 TV line resolution is evident in this particular photograph, and the four\ngray levels of this particular test pattern are distinctly visible. In tests\nwith other test patterns, full eight gray levels have been successfully recorded (e.g., Figure 5 of Third Quarterly Report).\nFurther discussion of the performance of these tubes will appear in\nSection VI where we discuss the complete cathodochromic storage device\nsystem.\n\n8\n\nIV. THE OPTICAL SYSTEM\nIn a cathodochromic CRT, an electron beam modulated by a video signal\nstores images or information as patterns of induced optical density. The\noriginal video signal can only be recovered if one somehow scans the stored\npattern and detects the induced optical density at each point on the CRT\nfaceplate. The simplest approach is the optical flying spot scanner\ntechnique whereby a light beam of constant intensity is scanned over the\nstored image and the light intensity transmitted by each point in the image\nis detected. In the present cathodochromic storage device the scanning\nspot of light is generated when a fast phosphor layer behind the cathodochromic layer is excited by a constant current electron beam. It is then\nthe function of the optical system to efficiently collect and detect the\nemerging phosphor emission and thereby regenerate the original video signal.\nIn the cathodochromic storage device several problems had to be considered\nas this simple optical detection technique was implemented. These arise\nprimarily because the phosphor layer must be thin to allow fast writing\n(see Section III), and because long-term readout is possible only if the\nreading electron beam current is so small as not to appreciably degrade the\nstored image through cathodochromic coloration. Both of these factors\nlimit the phosphor emission intensity available in readout, and the optical\nsystem must be highly sensitive and efficient; in other words, a sensitive\ndetector must receive a large solid angle of radiation from each point on\nthe tube faceplate. The small phosphor thickness introduces a further\ncomplication because a thin powder layer will necessarily show spatial nonuniformities which give rise to spurious modulation or readout noise.\nFurthermore, the optical system must be compact, it must allow visual\nobservation of the CRT faceplate, and it must permit access to erase stored\nimages.\nThe optical system, which was-designed and developed based on these considerations and requirements, is shown in schematic cross section in\nFigure 5. As described in earlier reports, two detectors are used to\neliminate phosphor noise through ratio-recording. The Io detector receives\nonly long wavelength (> 5900 X) phosphor emission which is not modulated by\nthe cathodochromic absorption; variations in the Io output signal are\nentirely due to variation in phosphor emission. The I detector records\nshorter wavelength phosphor emission which contains not only the phosphor\nnoise but also modulation due to the cathodochromic absorption. By taking\nthe I/Io ratio, the noise can, in principle, be eliminated and only the\nmodulation signal of interest is retained. Efficient but compact light\ncollection is accomplished through internally polished aluminum cones. The\ndetectors are RCA 4465 photomultipliers with S-20 spectral response. B is\na light-tight box which seals to a panel in the electronics rack; it excludes ambient light. The whole optical system is hinged so that it may\nswing about a vertical axis as shown by the photograph in Figure 6. This\nprovides complete access to inspect or erase the cathodochromic faceplate.\n\n9\n\nNO. 26 WRATTEN\nFILTER\n10\n\nDETECTOR\nSHUTTER\nELECTRONICS\nRACK\n\nINTERNALLY REFLECTING CONE\nSHUTTER\n\nCATHODOCHROMIC\nTUBE WITH\nPHOSPHOR\n\nSEMI- REFLECTING\nMIRROR\n\nI\n\nFigure 5.\n\nI\nDETECTOR\n\n27"\n\ncross section of the optical\nA schematic horizontal\nsystem used to "read out" stored images.\n\n10\n\nFigure 6.\n\nThe optical system as it appears when it is swung\nopen to expose the cathodochromic MAD CRT for inspection and erasure.\n\nThe hinged door shown in Figure 5 provides a more limited access to the\nfaceplate; in most applications one can easily swing open the whole system\nand this door will not be extensively used. Whenever the optical system is\nopened, the shutters should be closed to protect the photomultipliers from\nroom light or erasing light. If the system should accidentally be opened\nwithout closing the shutters a warning buzzer is automatically activated,\nand the power to the erase lamp is disconnected (Figure 25 of Appendix).\nIt should be noted that this is a relatively fast optical system. For\na point at the center of the CRT all radiation within 26.5* of the forward\ndirection is collected (neglecting reflection losses). Stated in other\nterms, an f/l cone of radiation or all radiation within 0.21 7 steradians\nis collected from this center point. For points near the edges of the CRT\nraster the light collection will be slightly less effi\' ient.\n\n11\n\nIn the prototype version of this optical system the beamsplitter was a\naluminum mirror\ndielectric dichroic mirror rather than a semi-reflecting\nthis was a very attractive approach\nIn principle,\n(see earlier reports).\nbecause no other filters were needed and the maximum available phosphor\nemission was detected.

These pictures were taken with the hinged door\n(Figure 5) swung open. -In Figure 7(a) we see, at the mouth of the I cone,\na small plane mirror positioned so that light emitted by the phosphor layer\nand transmitted through the semi-reflecting mirror is reflected up to the\nlens of a camera mounted on top of the light-tight.box.

Therefore, in\nreadout, the mirror is rotated by 90* as shown in Figure 7(b); only the\nnarrow "edge-on" thickness of the mirror system then blocks radiation to\nthe I detector.\nThe photography arrangement is such that a Nikon F camera with an f/1.4\nor an f/2.0 lens plus a No. 2 closeup lens will properly and conveniently\nfocus on the CRT faceplate. To focus one has only to loosen the wing nut\nwhich clamps the camera in position and then make the necessary adjustments\nwhile the camera lens remains seated in a light-tight felt-lined positioning socket on top of the mounting box. With the Nikon F lenses indicated\nabove, a 3-in. x 4-in. raster on the CRT faceplate focusses to an image\narea of approximately 13 mm x 17 mm. In some situations it might be desirable to record somewhat larger images in which case we would recommend that\na 55-mm f/3.5 micro Nikor lens should be used. The latter lens will obviate\nthe necessity for the somewhat inconvenient closeup lens.\n\n12\n\nr\n\n"\n\n--\n\nS\n\n*i\n\nI\n\ni:\n\nF P1\nI\n\n.~,\n\nf\ni I.\n\n"\n\nBp\n\n0\n\n,i9\nFigure 7 (a).\n\nThe optical system used to produce a permanent\nphotographic record of information being stored\n\nin the cathodochromic faceplate.\n\n13\n\n-.\n\n1\n\n/1,\n\nI;\n\nI\n\nAi\n\nduring\nimg\n\neaot\n\n14t\n\n4\n\nIt should be noted that the photography system is designed to record\nthe phosphor light which is emitted while a modulated electron beam is\nstoring an image inthe cathodochromic material.

The\ncathodochromic excitation characteristic presented in Section III of this\nreport is such that single-frame writing at 26 kV requires electron beam\n\ncurrents of approximately 500 pA. This rather large current at high voltage\nmust be accurately focussed to retain high resolution, and it must be operative for precisely one vertical TV frame. To produce higher contrast images\nit may frequently be desirable to write over a larger but accurately known\nnumber of frames; this implies the use of a "write timer" or "vertical frame\ncounter".\nDuring readout, further conditions must be satisfied. The phosphor\nlayer must be excited by a low current electron beam which scans precisely\nthe raster that was scanned during the storage operation; failure to maintain good raster registration will result in failure to detect all of the\nstored information. An upper limit on the readout electron beam current\ncan easily be estimated by noting that one might commonly perform the\nstorage operation in two frames or 1/15 sec at 500 pA. In readout the same\naccelerating voltage is used, and the electron beam uniformly and continuously colors the whole of the cathodochromic raster. When the readout\nbeam exposure approaches equivalence with the storage exposure, the image\nin the cathodochromic will be very seriously degraded. Therefore, if we\nrequire continuous readout for 15 minutes the reading current must certainly\nbe given by.\ni\n\nreadout\n\n<\n\n500\n\n0.04 ,A\n\n50\n15 x 15 x 60\n\n(3)\n\nThis is a very small current that should be held precisely constant because\nany fluctuations produce spurious and unnecessary noise in the phosphor\nemission level. In readout the capability to switch between single-frame,\nmultiple-frame, and continuous readout is highly desirable.\nThe photomultiplier signals generated during readout must be amplified\nand processed to generate a composite video signal output which can then\nbe used to drive a second cathodochromic dark-trace CRT, a standard kinescope, or some other suitable display device. In particular, one must include the circuitry necessary to perform the ratio detection operation\ndiscussed in the previous section of this report. Also, appropriate synchronization must be added to the processed photomultiplier output signals.\nA block diagram of the interconnected units which perform the various\nfunctions and operations discussed above is shown in Figure 8. The incoming signal is fed directly to the gamma corrector. Only the video\nportion of the composite signal should be subject to gamma correction; the\nsynchronizing (sync) and blanking information must not be modified or lost.\nTherefore, the gamma amplifier first separates out the sync and blanking\nsignals and then applies gamma correction to the video portion of the\nsignal. This is accomplished through field-effect transistors which exhibit\n\n17\n\nHIGH\n\nPOWER\n\nVOLTAGE\nREAD\nWRITE\nSWITCH\n\nCOMPOSITE\nINPUT\nSIGNAL\n\nPHOTO\n\nMI\nULTIPLIER\nGAMMA\nCORRECTOR\n\nVIDEO\n\nco\n\nW\n\nRITE\n\nWRITE\n\nI\n\nCOMPOSITE\nS~IGNAL\nL,NAI\nG\n\nREAD\nWRITE\nSWITCH\nFigure 8.\n\nREAD\n\nTIMER\n\nTIMER\n\nRIDE\n\nSYNC\nGAIN\n\nR\n\nWRITE\n\nVITE\n\nNO.2\n\nCATHODOCHROMIC\nDISPLAY\nI\nTUBE\n\nAMPLIFIER\nAND\nDEFLECTION\n\nDISABLE\n\nOUTPUT\n\nSUPPLY\n\nPOWER\nSUPPLY\n\n[\nI\n\nPHOTO\n\nMULTIPLIER\nNO.1\nPOWER\n\nEAD\n\nP WER\n\nOVER-\n\nRIDESUPPLY\n\nSPROCESSING\n-\n\nAMPLIFIER\n.\n\nCLIP\n\nLEVEL\n\nCORRECTION\nGAIN\n\nAMPLIFIER\nREAD\n\nA schematic block diagram of the electronic system\nshowing interconnections between the various functional ingredients of the system.\n\nNO.2\n\na quadratic relationship between drain current and gate voltag e i.e.,\nIo = k(EG) 2 .

A parallel but separate\nto the deflection circuitry for scan synchronizing\nsupplies the same pulses\npurposes and also to the processing amplifier where they are combined with\nthe photomultiplier output signal. It should be noted that all sync information is derived from the input line; unless an input signal or some\nexternal sync source is operative a proper output signal cannot be generated.\nThe basic amplifier and deflection system is a somewhat modified\nHewlett Packard Model 6946A precision television monitor. This particular\nmonitor was chosen because it offers exceptional scan linearity and very\nstable deflection circuitry. The latter characteristic is essential to\nmaintain raster registration during multiple frame storage and long-term\nreadout. The monitor also permits extensive variation in the raster size;\nuses of this capability are discussed in the next section of the report.\nThe frequency response of the monitor video circuits is flat to 8 MHz, thus\nallowing accurate storage of test patterns with greater than 500 line\nresolution.\n\nThe monitor has been modified to adapt it to the cathodochromic storage\ndevice system. The normal 17-in. kinescope has been removed and a separate\nmounting chassis for the 5-in. MAD cathodochromic tube has been installed.\nA separate chassis containing high-voltage, regulated power supply units\nfor the 2nd anode (0-10 kV) and ultor (0-30 kV) electrodes of the 5-in.\ntube has been constructed. Other specific circuit changes and additions to\nthe monitor are discussed in detail in the Appendix. Most of these changes\nare directly related to the various modes of operation of the system. For\nexample, the READ-WRITE SWITCH on the master control panel activates or\ndeactivates relays in the monitor and thereby transfers the monitor between\nWRITE and READ modes. In the WRITE mode an input video signal modulates\nthe CRT electron beam; in the READ mode the beam current is held constant.\nRegardless of the position of the READ-WRITE switch a DISABLE-ENABLE switch\nrespectively grounds or does not ground the CRT screen grid thereby prohibiting or permitting the flow or electron beam current. In the combined\nENABLE and WRITE situation it is possible to write continuously by depressing a WRITE OVER-RIDE switch. Alternatively, the WRITE TIMER may be\nactivated and the writing will proceed for a preselected number of vertical\nframes (1, 2, 4 or 8 -- see 2nd Quarterly Report).

PERFORMANCE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMPLETED SYSTEM\n\nThe completed cathodochromic storage device system consists of the equipment shown in Figure 9 plus a separate TV picture monitor (RCA Model AL006W).\nThe electronic system described in Section V is housed in the main body of the\nrack while the optical system discussed in Section IV is the unit mounted in\nfront of the rack. The system is relatively compact; this prototype unit uses\na 4 4 -in. height in a standard 19-in. rack. The whole unit operates from a\nstandard 115-V 60-Hz power line fused for 20 A. No cooling or ventilating\n\ndovics are usd ,and no unusual anvironmental controls are required.\nA. STORAGE\nMany of the system tests were performed using an "Indian Head" test\npattern of the type shown in Figure 10. This photograph shows the incoming\ntest pattern as it is displayed on the "picture monitor" TV set. The moir&\nstructure in the photograph is a striking demonstration of the consequences\nof improper scan interlace. The "vertical hold" on the picture monitor should\nalways be carefully adjusted so that such moir6 effects do not appear. The\nhigh-quality precision television monitor (Section V) provides very accurate\nand reliable interlaced scanning; these moir6 patterns are not observed in\nimages stored in the cathodochromic tubes.\n(See, for example, the stored\nimage photograph shown in Figure 4.)\nTimes as small as 1/30 sec are adequate to store useful images in the\ncathodochromic layer of a MAD CRT. Single-frame writing currents are\ntypically 400 to 500 IA. When the system is properly adjusted, these 1/30-sec\nexposures yield images with a white-light contrast ratio of 1.2:1. In carefully filtered green light the single-frame contrast ratio approaches 1.4:1.\nWith longer exposures, the MAD CRT\'s are capable of white-light contrast\nratios approaching 2. With this range of contrast, eight distinguishable gray\nlevels are readily displayed. The quality of stored images is somewhat\nimproved when slightly less than peak writing currents are used because the\nbeam spot size is then reduced leading to better resolution. Furthermore, the\noutput voltage of the ultor power supply tends to sag slightly during the\nfirst field of very high current writing; when lower currents and longer times\nar_ used the raster size is somewhat more stable. Where it is convenient,\nmultiple-frame writing at 50 to 150 pA beam currents is recommended.\nThe resolution of images stored in these MAD cathodochromic tubes is\nexcellent. The available test pattern is completely reproduced with 500 TV\nline resolution; this corresponds to 1/4 million bits of stored information.\nIt is believed that, at lower currents, the system is capable of storing more\nthan twice this amount of information. This conclusion is derived from the\nknown bandwidth of the storage circuitry (8 MHz), the characteristics of the\n5Z electron gun (as discussed in the Second Quarterly Report) and the uniform,\nsmall-particle nature of the cathodochromic screens. Such very high resolution has not been demonstrated because no suitable input signal was readily\navailable. Furthermore, as discussed below, such high-resolution patterns are\n\n21\n\nrr\n\nTI\n\nNJ\nstorage\nFigure 9.

This is supported by the\nfact that higher resolution images are observed when the same video signals are\nfed to a higher quality Conrac television monitor. However, even then, the\nresolution is somewhat inferior to the resolution of the actual stored images.\nThis resolution degradation in readout is presently not well understood.

Four very-well-defined levels are shown; it\nis quite easy to see that separate and distinguishable levels could lie\nbetween each of these four.\nThe degradation of the stored image during readout is very slow. The\nscanning electron beam current during readout is typically 50 nA and continuous\nreadout for 10 minutes degrades the output signal-to-noise ratio by less than\n3 dB. Periodic readout over periods of several hours has been demonstrated.\nEven more extended readout periods can be achieved by manipulating the electron\nbeam voltages as described and demonstrated below.\nThe penetration depth of an electron beam varies roughly as the square of\nthe accelerating voltage. Therefore, with the layered structures of the MAD\nCRT, a low-voltage electron beam should dissipate most of its energy in the YAG\nphosphor layer.\nIn this case, the electron beam will not appreciably darken\nthe cathodochromic layer, and the readout process should proceed with very\nlittle degradation of a stored image.

CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe cathodochromic storage device substantially meets all of the design\ngoals of the present contract effort. Information, presented in a standard TV\nformat, is stored in a single TV frame time. Images with better than 500 TV\nline resolution and close to 2:1 contrast ratio are recorded. The information\nstorage time in a dark environment is approximately 24 hours. At any time,\nthe stored information may be recovered in the form of a reconstituted\nelectronic video signal. The reconstituted signal can be generated continuously for times in excess of 10 minutes. The resolution in readout is approximately 350 TV lines. This device should be very useful in a wide range of\napplications. We believe that further work will lead to cathodochromic storage\ndevices capable of more efficient writing, higher contrast storage, and\ngreater readout resolution.\n\n29\n\nVIII.

The first step after\nunpacking should be the installation of one of the three MAD tubes supplied.\n(These are labelled as 14-3, 39B and 15C; 14-3 and 39B are good MAD tubes,\n14-3 being the better. Tube 15C should be used only for storage display).\nLargely because of a yoke rotator attachment installed following a NASA request\nduring acceptance testing, this operation requires several steps. Performance\nof these steps in the order given below is recommended whenever a tube is\ninstalled or changed. In the initial installation it will be necessary first\nto remove the black bakelite box that excludes light from the main body of a\nmounted tube; this is accomplished by loosening the wing nut on the left rear\ncorner of the box and then lifting the box back and up from the chassis. The\ndeflection yoke assembly is contained in a box tied to the chasis in which the\ncathodochromic tubes are normally mounted.\n1.\n\nFrom the front of the rack insert the base of the tube through the hole\nprovided and through the deflection assembly.

Turn on the photomultiplier power supplies and the external\nmonitor. Unless the REGULATION settings have been disturbed (see item E) the\nsystem is now ready to respond to input video signals.\n\nD.\n\nIMAGE STORAGE\n\nAttach the input signal cable carrying standard composite TV video\nsignals to the "COMPOSITE VIDEO IN" BNC connector on the rear of the GAMMA\nAMPLIFIER. Turn the CONTRAST and BRIGHTNESS dials on the PRECISION MONITOR\nto approximately 60.\n(For further information on these settings see item F).\nPlace the system in the WRITE mode and then ENABLE. Check to be sure that\nthe shutters in front of the two photomultiplier detectors are closed. Press\n\nthe WRITE OVER-RIDE or FRAME WRITE switches to write continuously or during a\nprecise number of vertical TV frames. (Limits on writing electron beam\nexposure are indicated in item F.)\n\nE.\n\nFOCUSSING ADJUSTMENTS\n\nHigh-resolution images can be recorded only if the electron beam writing\non the cathodochromic layer is properly focussed.\nTo achieve focussing it is\nnecessary that the 2nd anode potential of the MAD tube be set at some precise\nvalue relative to the ultor accelerating voltage.\nIn general, one must first\nselect the ultor voltage at which the cathodochromic tube will be operated and\nthen the 2nd anode voltage is varied until the electron beam striking the\nscreen is properly focussed. Various methods might be used to arrive at the\noptimum 2nd anode voltage; some suggestions are offered below.\nIt is recommended that the cathodochromic MAD CRT\'s be operated at ultor\nand 2nd anode voltages of approximately 24 and 6 kV, respectively.\nThe\nREGULATOR controls on the power supply were set for these levels prior to\nshipping. If they were disturbed in shipping and focussing\nis required,\nproceed as follows:\nTurn all VOLTAGE and REGULATOR controls completely\ncounter-clockwise. Then, simultaneously turn the two VOLTAGE controls\nclockwise until the meters show 6.5 and 25 kV.\nTurn the ultor REGULATOR\n\n36\n\nclockwise until 0.3 mA of regulator current is indicated by the current meter;\n(By simultaneous adjustthe voltage will drop back to approximately 24 kV.\nment of the REGULATOR and VOLTAGE controls a setting of 0.3 mA and any selected\nultor voltage may be achieved). Now adjust the focus REGULATOR control so that\nthe supply draws 0.3 mA; this should produce a reasonably good focus.\nTo achieve a more accurate focus, two different methods may be used. The\nfirst is a systematic trial and error procedure whereby a resolution test\npattern is repeatedly stored using only the minimum exposure required for a\nreasonably visible image. Between exposures the image is erased and the focus\nVOLTAGE is slightly modified (with corresponding REGULATOR adjustments). By\nobserving whether the resolution of the stored image is improved or degraded by\neach adjustment, the setting for optimum focus is easily deduced. In the\nsecori method the BRIGHTNESS setting is reduced until the phosphor emission\nwhile writing is just sufficient to give an easily visible image. Then, while\ncontinuously writing, the 2nd anode voltage can be adjusted to optimum focus\nby observing the resolution of the phosphor emission image. With the second\nmethod care must be exercised to avoid tube damage due to overexposure of the\ncathodochromic (see item F for permissible exposures).\n\nF.\n\nCONTRAST AND BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS\n\nExcessive electron beam exposures on cathodochromic sodalite will cause\n"burning" in the sense that excessively colored areas cannot be completely\nbleached back to their original uncolored state. It is therefore important\nthat the MAD cathodochromic tubes not be subjected to excessive exposures.\n2\nExposures greater than 20 Lcoulombs/in. should not be used. Permissible\nexposure levels can be specified through exposure times plus CONTRAST and\nBRIGHTNESS settings which determine the electron beam current. Typical\nsettings for MAD tube #14-3 are given below; similar settings can be used\nwith #39B and #15C but the beam current should be periodically checked as\nthe tubes age. The maximum exposure time in the table below assumes a\n12-in. 2 raster. These maximum values should be decreased for smaller raster\nareas. CONTRAST settings in excess of 70 should not generally be used. For\nvery fast writing (1 or 2 TV frames) the BRIGHTNESS should be set at approximately 80.\n\n37\n\nCONTRAST\n\nCURRENT\n(pA)\n\nBRIGHTNESS\n\nMAXIMUM EXPOSURE TIME\n(sec)\n\n60\n\n55\n\n20\n\n12\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n6\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n3.5\n\n65\n\n50\n\n20\n\n12\n\n65\n\n55\n\n40\n\n6\n\n65\n\n60\n\n70\n\n3.5\n\nSuppose that one wished to store six overlapping images (as proposed by\nA. Schulman of NASA Goddard). Then one should typically set CONTRAST =\n55,\nBRIGHTNESS = 55, and use FRAME-WRITE set at 8 to store each image.\nG.\n\nIMAGE READOUT\n\nPlace the WRITE-READ switch in READ. Open the shutters in front of\nthe\nphotomultiplier detectors (shutter control levers pulled out\nas far as\npossible). Check that the photomultiplier power supplies are\nturned on with\napplied voltage of approximately 1 and 1.3 kV on the I and Io detectors,\nrespectively. Place the DISABLE-ENABLE switch in ENABLE. Increase\nthe READOUT\nPHOS. EXC. LEVEL until a readout image is displayed on the external PICTURE\nMONITOR. This will occur at 60% to 80% of the maximum setting. In this\nmode\n(which is the most convenient for many applications) the detected image\nis\ncontinuously displayed without operator intervention.\nTo obtain the readout image most pleasing to the observer, several\nadjustments can and should be made. First, the PHOS. EXC. LEVEL may be\nadjusted; this modifies the contrast in the displayed image. Simultaneous\nadjustment of the picture monitor brightness and contrast controls\nis also\nfrequently desirable. Next, the CORRECTION GAIN can be adjusted. Increasing\nthis gain tends to remove granular noise in the reconstructed\nimage; a\nsimultaneous increase in PHOS. EXC. LEVEL is usually\ndesirable. If the\npicture tends to roll or tear, the SYNC. GAIN should be\nadjusted.\nTo use the READ OVER-RIDE or FRAME READ modes the.READOUT\nPHOS. EXC.\nLEVEL should first be turned to zero and then slowly increased\nwhile the\nREAD OVER-RIDE is depressed. The required PHOS. EXC.\nLEVEL setting is\ndetermined by adjusting for an optimum readout. At this\noptimum setting FRAME\nREAD can be used.\n\n38\n\nH.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHING INCOMING DATA\n\nRemove the plug on the top of the beamsplitter box in the optical system\nand mount a Nikon F camera as discussed in the FINAL REPORT. Use the knob on\nthe bottom of this box to rotate the photography mirror into position to\nreflect phosphor emission light to the camera lens. At low BRIGHTNESS\nsettings (or beam currents) in WRITE mode, focus on the image due to\nphosphor emission. The system is now ready to photograph incoming data.\nThe proper lens opening and exposure time are always dependent on the\nfilm speed. To get a complete picture (frame) the exposure time must in any\ncase, always exceed 1/30 sec. The following are estimates of optimum\nexposure:\n(i)\n\nBRIGHTNESS = 50, CONTRAST = 65, ASA 400 film.\nExposure Time = 1/2 sec.\n\nLens at f/4,\n\n(ii) An ASA 400 film normally records a good image at f/8 when the\ncamera exposure time is equal to the writing time required to\nstore a fully exposed image in the cathodochromic layer.\n\nI.\n\nMEASURING BEAM CURRENTS\n\nThe BNC connector on the 0 to 30 kV half of the high-voltage power supply\nis provided to measure electron beam currents. This connector is across a 1000ohm resistor in the ground leg of the power supply. When the REGULATOR\ncontrol is turned counterclockwise so that the regulation circuit is inoperative, all of the ultor current is drawn through this resistor and the writing\ncurrent level can be measured by displaying the BNC output on a dc-coupled\ncalibrated oscilloscope. Because there is a large ac ripple on this signal,\na 40- to 100-pF (15 V) capacitor from the cable to ground will greatly\nfacilitate the measurement. To measure the reading current (typically 100 nA)\nit is necessary to use a precision dc voltmeter (e.g., Model 825A Fluke\nvoltmeter) with a very large filter capacitor (e.g., 1000 IF).\n\nJ.\n\nDETAILED SCHEMATICS AND CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION\n\nThe electronic circuits which are used in the cathodochromic display system warrant further discussion and a more detailed description of each\ncircuit will be presented.\nAs a starting point the reader is referred to the system block diagram\nEach of the blocks represents a clearly defined portion of the\n(Figure 15).\noverall system; it is appropriate to discuss the system as a whole and then\nthe operation of each block individually.\n\n39\n\nHIGH\nVOLTAGE\n\nREAD\nINPUT\n\nPOWER\n\nWRITE\nSWITCH\n\nCOMPOSITE\n\nPOWER\n\nI\n\nSUPPLY\n\nSUPPLY\n\nPHOTO\n\nSIGNAL\n\nGAMMA\nCORRECTOR\n\nMULTIPLIER -\n\nVIDEO\n\nDISABLE\n\nAMPLIFIER\nAND\nDEFLECTION\n\nCATHODOODISPLAY\n"I\nTU BE\n\nNO.2\nPHOTO\nMULTIPLIER\nM LT\n\nSYNC\n\nNO.I\n\nWRITE\n\nOVERRIDE\n\nWRITE\n\nTIMER\n\nREAD\n\nTIMER\n\nREAD\n\nP\n\nRIDE\n\nSUPPLY\n\nOVER-\n\nPOWER\n\nSYNC\nGAIN\n\nAMPLIFIER\n\nWRITE\n\nCOMPOSITE\nOUTPUT\n\nSR\n\nPROCESSING 1\nNO.

In\naddition, the system operation mode must be changed to provide unmodulated beam\ncurrent during the information recovery or "READ" operation.\nThe deflection and signal amplification for the cathodochromic display\ntube are supplied by a Hewlett Packard precision TV monitor type 6946A. Some\nmodifications were necessary. The kinescope supplied with the monitor was\nremoved and a suitable mounting arrangement was constructed to hold the\ncathodochromic tube. In addition, the high-voltage power supply was removed\nand discarded since it does not supply the correct voltages for the cathodochromic tube. Further modifications to the precision monitor circuits are\nshown in Figure 16. Specifically they are as follows:\n(1) A plus 300-volt power supply is added to the monitor. This consists of a transformer, rectifiers, filter, and zener diode regulator. This\nsupply is used to provide G2 voltage for the kinescope gun.\n(2) The kinescope signals are presented to the gun through a switching\nnetwork so that the system can be used in either the "WRITE" or "READ" mode of\noperation. This change is accomplished by means of a 3-pole double-throw\nrelay. In the "WRITE" mode the gun cathode is connected to the monitor video\ncircuits, the grid G1 is connected to the monitor brightness control, and the\nmonitor works as a normal receiver except for the fact that the gun can be\nturned "ON" or "OFF" by application or removal of G 2 voltage as controlled\nthrough B by the "DISABLE-ENABLE" switch on the control panel. In the "READ"\nmode of operation the cathode is switched to a constant current control which\nis called "READ PHOS. EXC. LEVEL". G1 is dc grounded and the remaining relay\ncontact changes from the "WRITE" timing circuits to the "READ" timing circuits.\n(3) A pulse-forming network is added to take information from the\nvertical deflection system and provide a pulse suitable for driving the timer\ncounting circuits.\n(4) A video signal relay is added to switch the external video monitor\nfrom the incoming video signal during "WRITE" to the signal derived from the\ncathodochromic tube during "READ".\n(5) A cable is added to allow connection to the various operating\ncontrols which are located on the main control panel (shown in Figure 20).\nThe signals carried on the control cable are as follows:\nTerminal A - ground\n\nTerminal B - G2 control voltage ("WRITE" keying signal (0 or +200 V)\nTerminal C - "READ" keying signal (0 or 3 V)\nTerminal D - "WRITE"-"READ" timer change (0 or + 1 V)\n\n41\n\nIOOK\n\n2W\n\nREAD\nBRIGHTNESS\n\n+300V\n\nUZ210)\n\nUZ210 (3)\n\nW\n\n25K\n\nDIODES\n\nlOOK\nOOK\nKINE\nGUN\nI----I\n\n+\n\n10/450\n\n+\n\n120V\n\n10/4\n\n0\n\nF\n\n_\n\n"\n\nI\n-\n\nSTANCOR\n\nP-6375\nTRANSFORMER\n\nN764.\n(2)\n120V\n\n2\n\nZENER\n\n22K\nWRITE\nBRIGHTNESS\n\n3.9K\n\nREAD\nIN\n\n220K\n\nMON\nOUT\n\nWRITE\nIN\n\n22W K\n2W\n!\n\nL\n\nTO\nVIDEO CIRCUIT\n75\n\nIM\n\nIIOV\nR LY\nFROM VIDEO\n\nuloV\nRELAELAY\n\n_EA\n\nCIRCUIT\n\nTO\nVERTICAL\nDEFLECTION\n\n0.0068\nRELAYS SHOWN IN WRITE\nPOSITION\n\nIOK\n\nYOKE\n\n.P\n\nIK\n\nIN 4v\n\n2.7K\n\n(2)\n50/15\n\n2.7K\n\nPULSE\n-\n\nv\n\nFORMING\nNETWORK\n\nFigure 16.\n\nSchematic diagrams showing circuit modifications to the precision monitor.\n\nTerminal E - + 4.5 volts\n\nTerminal F - 60 cycle pulse to timer circuits (amplitude 2 volts)\nTerminal G - 110 volts\nTerminal H - 110 volts\n\nThis completes the changes to the TV monitor chasis. Some of the controls\nwere moved to the back panel, but otherwise the remaining circuits are as\ndescribed in the H/P operating manual for the monitor.\nThe high-voltage power supply for the cathodochromic display tube is a\ncompletely separate unit. It should be treated with care as it supplies\nvoltages which are dangerous and even lethal. It comprises two supplies, one\nfor the focus electrode which requires about 6 kV and the other for the ultor\nwhich may run as high as 27 kV. Both supplies are fully adjustable and regulated for both line and load variations. The schematic is shown in Figure 17.\nThe two supplies are similar in operation with the exception that one operates\nin the 0-10 kV range and the other in the 0-3 kV range. The reference\nvoltage for the regulator is derived from a 300-V zener-diode-regulated source.\nThe high-voltage regulator is a shunt type regulator which means it is in\nparallel with the kinescope load and it draws an appropriate current to\nmaintain the output voltage at a fixed level. Metering is provided to\nobserve the output voltage and the regulator current. Setup procedure is as\nIncrease the variac voltage control until the output voltage is\nfollows:\nabout 1 kV higher than the desired value. Then increase the regulator control until the regulator draws about 300 VA of current or the voltage\ndecreases to the desired value. At all times observe the following procedure:\nturn voltage control down when not in use. Increase voltage as the last\nstep in turning the system "ON" and as the first step in turning the system\n"OFF". Allow time (1 minute) between turning on power switch and increasing\nvoltage control so that the tubes can warm up and come to operating condition.\nIf the cover to the power supply is removed for any reason, extreme caution\nto avoid contact with high-voltage components is essential; no interlock\nprotection is provided. Also\'exercise all possible caution to ensure that the\nkinescope gun and the deflection circuits are operating before turning up the\nhigh voltage, or serious damage to the tube can result, especially in the\nabsence of deflection.\nThe next portion of the system to be discussed is the input signal gamma\ncorrector. As mentioned elsewhere in the report, the cathodochromic material\nis highly nonlinear in its characteristic of light absorption VS activation\nenergy. In order to restore linearity to the system, it is necessary to\ncreate a compensating non-linearity in the electronic signal processing; this\nis the function of the gamma corrector.\nRefer to Figure 18 for the gamma corrector block diagram and to Figure 19\nfor the corresponding schematic diagram. Operation is as follows: The power\nsupply consists of a zener-diode-regulated +10 V conventional unit. The input\nand output signals to the gamma corrector are nominally 1 volt peak to peak,\n\n43\n\nPOWERSTAT\n2A(IOB)\n\nHIGH\n\nVOLTAGE\n\nO-30KV\n\n<\n\nBNC TP\n\n75 M\n\n-\n\nt 2W\nI\n75M\n\nI\nK\n0\n\nI\n\nO-ImA\n\n2W\n\nF\n\nAC\n\n152M\n\n2W\nTP\n\n5A\n\ni 50M\n\nREGULATOR\n\nREG.\n\nIOT\n\nHELIPOT\n\nIKIGHT\nL\n\nZENE\n\nSTANCOR\nPS- 8416\n\nAC\n\n2.7K\n\n125V\n\nCT\nIiOV\n\n" IODB6A\n\n125V\n\nPILOT\n\nUZ2I(3)\n20/450\n\nAC\n\nZENER\n,\n\nDIODES\n\nPILOT\n6.3V\n\nFigure 17.\n\nI\n\nOOK\n\nUZ22()\n\n75M\n\n0-100 A 50M\n0IOOK\nW\nDUPLICATE\n\nO-IOKV\n\nON\n\n180\n\n30KV\n\n2M\n\nVOLT.\n\nOFF\n\n2W\n\n-O(E\n\nPOWERSTAT\n20 B)\nO\n\nCAP\n\n6BK4A\n\n2W\n\n30KV\n\n152M\n\nAC\n\nCONNECTOR\n\n2M\n\n+\n\nVOLT.\n\nTUBE FILAMENTS\n\nCircuit diagram of the regulated dual power supply unit.\n\nsYNC\nADDER\n\nSYNC\nSEPARATORI\n\nINVERTER\nAND\nOUTPUT\n\nVIINDEO\nOUT\n\nCOMPOSITE\nVIDNEO\n\nCOMPOSITE\n\n(\n\nY\n\nOUTPUT\nSYNC\n\nOUT\n\nVIDEO\nSEPARATOR\n\nGAM MA\nAMPLI FIER\n\nINVERTER\n\nA\nGA MM\nAMPLIFIE\n\nPOWER\nSUPPLY\n\nFigure 18.\n\nA schematic block diagram of the gamma corrector amplifier.\n\n+IOV\n\n4\n\n40361\n\nOFF\nON\'\n\nODB6A\n+\n\nAC\n\n270\n\nO\nE\n6\n\nPILOT\n18K\n\n510 15T\n0\n\nSYNC\nGAIN\n\n100\n\nLIGHT IIOV II\n\n100/15\n\n82\n\nF3.9K\n\nI\n\n2-\n\nSTANCOR\n\n+IOV\n416\nW-\n\n27K 20\n\nOUT\n\n100\n\nP-6375\n\n200/15\n\n200/\n15\n\n3.9K\n\nIOOK,\n\nI\n\nVIDEO IN\n\n2N4126\n\nIN\n75fi\n\n1\n\nVIDEO -2\n1\n\nI\n2/iF.\n5IN IO\n\n- -\n\nOUTO\n\n2N5457\n\nN\n\n2\n\n+\n\n2\n\nD2/1O514\n\nI\n\nIK\n\n2.2\n\nD 200/15\nIK 39.5K\n\n2N4126\n15\n\ns\n\n/2w\n\n/eW\n\nIN54\n\nM 0\n\n6.8\noo\n\nFigure 19.\n\n39\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n2N4126\n\n2N5457\n\n8K\n\nLEVEL\n+1OV\n\n+\n\n180\n\nVI\n\n$39 6.8K\n\n75\n\n270\n300/6\n\nA detailed circuit diagram for the gamma corrector amplifier.\n\n500/3\n\n75-ohm source, 70% video, 30% sync, standard TV distribution signals.

These relays provide the necessary\nthe external monichanges to the kinescope gun circuits as well as switching\ntor from the "WRITE" to the "READ" signals.\nThe "DISABLE" switch grounds G2 of the kinescope gun and thus prevents\nbeam current from reaching the kinescope screen regardless of the G1 and\ncathode potentials.\nThe "READ" and "WRITE" override switches function in parallel with the\ntimer outputs to allow gun current for as long as such switch is depressed.\nOnly the designated switch works, depending on the system mode of operation.\n\n47\n\n100\n\nPROCESSING\nAMPLIFIER\nPLUGS\n\nPHOTOPO6VTO\nMULTIPLIER\n\n,-\n\nS1000/15\nOFF\n\nON\n\n..\nOA\n\nSTANCOR\n\no-\n\nP-6375\n\nLEVE L\n\nL0\n\n-6V\n\n10\n\nSIODB6A\n\n\'\n\nCAC\n\nP- 6134\n\n10\n40361\n\nAIIODB6A\nTO SIG.\n\nii\n\nDEFLECTION\nCHASSIS\n\nI\n\nI\ni\n\n1 1----\n\nWRITE\n\nFigure20.Thecontrol RIDE\nOVER\n\n8 C D\n\'=\n..\n.E\n--- WRITE\n"\nTIMER\n\nFigure 20.\n\nA\n\na\n\nC\n\nD E\n\nou\n\nov\n\nOv\n\nox\n\nox\n\nor\n\nodr\nor\n\nSYNCIN\n\nDISac c ircuO\n\nIK\n\nSREAD\n\nCW\n\nz\n\nSYNC\nGAIN\n\n+ 4.5V\n\n+ 4.5\nA\n\nuo--\n\n(CLOSED)\n-\n\nO\noN\n\nos\n\nIN3826A\nCABLE I 1,\n\nOM\nON TO COR.\n\n-- _\n\n-\n\noK\nOF\n\nOF oK\n--\n\n5K\nT6\n\nIM\n\nREAD(CLOSED)\n\n-\n\n.\n\nR 1000/15\n\nSTANCOR\n\no8\n\n--\n\n+6V\nSCLIP\n\nV\n\n-oA\n\nz\n\nVIDEO\n\n.

The light from the phosphor\nlayer is modulated by the absorption of the cathodochromic layer and passes\nthrough the optical system to the two photomultiplier cathodes.

The purpose\nlight signals to electrical signals which are then coupled through emitter\nfollowers to reduce to impedance level. The signals are transmitted on cables\nto the signal processing amplifiers (Figures 21 and 22) which are located on\nthe main control panel (Figure 20). The signal level on the coupling cables\nis about 10 millivolts. There are two processing amplifiers. The processing\nfor the correction signal is performed by board "B" which amplifies the\nsignal by a factor of 100 and delivers it to the output terminal through a\nlow-impedance drive amplifier. The gain of 100 is provided by a Texas\nInstrument IC amplifier type SN7510L which has a bandwidth of at least 10 MHz.\nThe signal amplifier "A" is somewhat more complex in that, in addition to the\ngain of 100, it provides clipping, peaking, signal correction, and sync\nadding. The clipping and peaking are provided by the transistor amplifier\nimmediately following the integrated-circuit amplifier. Clipping level is\nadjusted by changing the base bias voltage connected to terminal F. The most\npositive portion of the signal extends into the cutoff region of the transistor\noperating characteristic and is therefore clipped off. The collector load is\nfrequency-dependent because of the 100-pH inductor and so provides additional\ngain in the 3- to 4-MHz region of the frequency spectrum. The signal\ncorrection portion of the amplifier is the transistor type 2N4124 immediately\nfollowing the peaking and clipping stage. The function of this amplifier is\nto provide a variable gain in response to the signal from the correction\nchannel.. This is accomplished by using a field-effect transistor as the ac\nemitter resistor of a conventional RC-coupled amplifier. The effective\nresistance which the FET presents .is a function of its gate voltage and therefore the gain of the configuration for small signals is a linear function of\nthe gate voltage on the FET. This provides the approximate correction\ndesired. The final transistor of the amplifier is a low-impedance output\nstage with provision for adding sync. At terminal Z this yields a composite\nsignal of video and sync with 1-volt amplitude and at 75-ohm impedance.\nThe final portion of the system electronics is the timer. There are two\nidentical timers, one for "WRITE" and one for "READ". They consist of\nintegrated-circuit counters which use the Motorola series MC700 IC\'s (flipflops and dual-input gates). The basic idea is that a pulse is derived from\nthe vertical retrace interval of the monitor. A simple counting of these\npulses determines the number of fields which have been presented. Depressing\nthe "WRITE" or "READ" switch resets the counters to zero. Releasing the switch\nallows the counters to proceed. An output pulse is generated which starts at\nthe first retrace pulse following release of the switch and continues for twice\nthe number of retrace pulses as indicated on the time switch. The factor of\ntwo is included because there are two interlaced fields to make a complete\nframe, and the time switch indicates number of frames - each frame being about\n1/30 of a second in duration. The schematic of the timer is shown in Figure 23.\n\n49\n\nSIGNAL FROM\n\nPHOTOTUBE\n\n-\n\n0\n\nACLPLIFIERI\nA PLI IE\n\n40 db\nGAIN\n\nP\n\nAb\nPEAKING\nAMPLIFIER\n\nSI\n\nSIGNAL\nCORRECTION\nAMPLIFIER\n\nCORRECTION\nSIGNAL\n\nSIGNAL FROM\n\nGAIN\n\nCORRECTION\nPHOTOTUBE\n\nigure 21.\n\nOUTPUT\n\nSIGNAL\n\nAMPLIFIER\n\nOIDUT\n\nAMPLIFIER\n\nVOLTAGE\nVARIABLE\nRESISTOR\n\nAMPLIFIER\n\nCOMPOSITE\n\nOUTPUT\n\nINVERTER\nCORRECTION\nGAIN\n\nA schematic block diagram of the processing amplifiers.\n\nSYNC\n\n100\n\n6.8K\n\nI\n\nTI\n\n3.9\n\n100/15\n\n180\n\n270\n500/\n\n470\n\n2N2270\n\n2N4124\n\n2N4126\n\n3.3\n\n2\n\n100\n-\n\n100/15\n\n7\n\nSN7510L\n\n1.8K\n\n1.5K\n\n47\n\n:L 50/15\n\n10oo\n\n100\n\nTI\n75 SN7510\n\nd\n\nD\n4o\n\nFigure 22.\n\n.1 F\n\no t\n47K -\n\nI24\n2N4124\n\n0.00\n\n50/15\n\nHBOARD\n\n+\n\n100/15\n\n47\n47\n\n6.8K\n\n100/15 2N5457\n\n2N2270\n\nL\n8-\n\n100\n\nIK\n\n500\n\n50/5\n\nii\n\n1K\n\n100/15\n\nS150/5K\n\n100\n\n+\n\nH\n\nIOK\n\nIK\n\nBOARD "A"\nDetailed circuit diagrams for the processing amplifiers.\n\nN\n\n14\n\n1\n\n14\n\n1141\n\n14\n\n7247O\n\nMALE\n\n790\n\nA B C D\n\nE F H J K L M N P RS\n\nA\n\nE\n\nB C\n\nD\n\nS0\n\n0\n\nF H\n0\n\nJ\n\nK L\n\nFigure 23.\n\nP R S\n0?\n\nTIME\n\nFEMALE\n\n+4.5\n\nB\n\n0\n\nI\nPULSE\nOUT\n\nN\n\n)0\n\nPULSE I\n\nIN\n\nM\n\n*READ\nREAD\nWRITE\n\nA schematic diagram of the vertical frame timer.\n\n1\n\nalarm\nIn Figures 24, 25, and 26 we show the photomultiplier circuit, the\ncircuit, and the cabling diagram; these are self-explanatory.\n\nK.\n\nPRECAUTIONS AND TROUBLE SHOOTING\n\nA few words are in order to describe precautions which should be observed\nand possible hints to help locate malfunctions.\nis\n1.

Like other high-voltage devices, the 5ZP16 requires that certain\nprecautions be observed to minimize the possibility of failure due to humidity,\ndust, and corona. The tube itself has certain features designed to suppress\ncorona, arc-over, and high-voltage leakage so that maximum life and optimum\nperformance will result if the following precautions are observed.\nHumidity Considerations. When humidity is high, a continuous film of\nmoisture may form on untreated glass. If a high-voltage gradient is present,\nthis film may permit sparking to take place over the glass surface. In order\nto minimize the formation of a continuous moisture film, the glass cone of the\n5ZP16 is treated with a transparent moisture-repellent insulating coating.\nThis coating must not be scratched, and must be kept clean and free from\ncontamination such as fingerprints.
