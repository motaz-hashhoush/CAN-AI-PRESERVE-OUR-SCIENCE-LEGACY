The Tool is designed to reduce the time of flight and fuel consumption for aircraft flying in en route airspace. It provides each controller with the identities of aircraft in his/her sector, which can reduce their time en route by bypassing dog-legged route segments and flying \"direct to\" a waypoint closer to the destination airport. The Tool uses its build-in conflict probing capability to determine if the improved route is free of conflicts with other aircraft. The Tool's graphical computer interface enables the controller to enter a direct-to clearance by a simple point and click action. Because of its low workload and convenience, this method is strongly favored by controllers The Tool has been running since January with live radar data received at NASA from the Fort Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center. For aircraft operating in the Fort Worth Center, the Tool has the potential to save in excess of 500,000 in-flight minutes per year. A provisional patent application for this Tool has been filed. A field task in planned for the last quarter of this year.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Italy", "submissionId": 20050157867, "endDate": "1999-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Workshop on Advanced Technologies and their Impact on Air Traffic Management in the 21st Century", "location": "Capri", "id": "10b88974d9804b15b7a4b083f594f566", "startDate": "1999-09-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050157867, "id": "886f459d102c4bb6945f47c78e6d9f64", "publicationDate": "2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
