The hardware was a modification of another similar instrumentation system. A data bus coupler was designed and tested to interface the equipment to a central bus controller (computer). A serial digital data transfer mechanism was also designed. Redundant power supplies and overhead modules were provided to minimize the probability of a single component failure causing a catastrophic failure. The command decoder unit is packaged in a modular configuration to allow maximum user flexibility in configuring a system. Test procedures and special test equipment for use in testing the hardware are described. Results indicate that the unit will allow NASA to evaluate future software systems for use in space shuttles. The units were delivered to NASA and appear to be adequately performing their intended function. Engineering sketches and photographs of the command decoder unit are included.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760015839, "id": "41bb0250b3a5473cbede7822a97ff3fb", "publicationDate": "1976-03-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760015839.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760015839/downloads/19760015839.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760015839/downloads/19760015839.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760015839/downloads/19760015839.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
