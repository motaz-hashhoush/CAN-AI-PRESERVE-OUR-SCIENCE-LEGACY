The unit costs of this energy must be reduced from present levels if these missions are to be carried out at projected budget levels. The broad employment of electric propulsion and the capability to utilize novel high power sensors hinge on the availability of systems lighter by factors of ten or more than have flown to date. The NASA program aimed at providing the technological basis to meet these demands is described in this paper. Research and technology efforts in areas of energy conversion, storage and management are covered. In addition, work aimed at evolving the understanding necessary to cope with space environment interactions and at advanced concepts is described.", "title": "Space power for space", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T19:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19790032130, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mullin, J.
