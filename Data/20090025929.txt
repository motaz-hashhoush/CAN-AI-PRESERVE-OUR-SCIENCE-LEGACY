b'Xenia Spacecraft Study\n\nAddendum:\nSpacecraft Cost Estimate\nMarch 11, 2009\n\n1\n\nSpacecraft Cost\n\n2\n\nCost: GR&A\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1. All costs are in Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 dollars in millions based\non NASA inflation tables.\n2. The estimate is accomplished using the NAFCOM (NASA/Air\nForce Cost Model) cost model\n3. System Test Hardware (STH) cost represents one equivalent\nunit, and all applicable system integration (wrap) costs\nrepresent the wrap costs for one test unit.\n4. All weight data is expressed in kilograms and represents dry\nweight only.\n5. Subsystem costs are limited to prime contractor incurred,\nexclusive of fee and those costs outside the scope of the prime\ncontractor. Subcontractor effort, including fee in support of the\nprime contractor effort, is considered prime contractor incurred.\n6. Costs associated with the DDT&E effort encompass the\nperiod from the beginning of full scale development until the\nbeginning of the build of the first flight article. Costs associated\nwith the flight article are excluded from DDT&E.\n\n3\n\nCost: GR&A\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n7. Costs associated with the flight unit effort include the period\nbeginning with the start of production initiated by long lead\nprocurements and ending with the delivery of the first unit.\nFlight unit costs represent only the costs of the first unit to fly.\n8. All costs associated with mission operations and facilities are\nspecifically excluded.\n9. Individual subsystem totals contain all hardware costs and\nengineering and manufacturing labor costs charged to that\nsubsystem. These totals include all management, engineering,\ntesting, and assembly functions, including the labor, materials,\nspecific test equipment, and ground support equipment\nassociated with the integration of the components or assemblies\nin the subsystem.\n10. Fee and Program Support, calculated at the element level,\nare set at 10 and 20% respectively.\n4\n\nCost: GR&A\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n11. Contingency, also calculated at the element level, is set at\n20%, and vehicle integration, integration at the Cape, is set at\n4%.\nFalcon 9 cost taken from: http://www.spaceref.com/\n\n5\n\nCost: Summary\nItem\n\nDDT&E\n\nSubsystems\n\nFlight Unit\n\nTotal\n\n98.6\n\n36.8\n\n135.4\n\n35.1\n6.7\n18.3\n11.2\n5.2\n11.7\n4.1\n6.3\n\n7.6\n3.2\n8.2\n4.0\n1.0\n8.9\n1.4\n2.5\n\n42.7\n9.9\n26.5\n15.2\n6.2\n20.6\n5.5\n8.8\n\n51.4\n\n15.9\n\n67.3\n\n9.1\n13.7\n4.2\n7.9\n13.3\n3.2\n\n7.4\n\n16.5\n13.7\n4.2\n11.2\n18.5\n3.2\n\n150.0\n\n52.7\n\n202.7\n\nFee (10%)\nProgram Support (20%)\nContingency (20%)\nVehicle Integration (4%)\n\n15.0\n33.0\n39.6\n9.5\n\n5.3\n11.6\n13.9\n\n20.3\n44.6\n53.5\n9.5\n\nTOTAL Spacecraft\n\n247.1\n\n83.5\n\n330.6\n\nStructures/Mechanisms\nPropulsion\nElectrical Power & Distribution\nCommand & Data Handling\nCommunication\nAttitude Control\nCabling\nThermal control\n\nSystem Integration\nIntegration, Assembly and Checkout\nSystem Test Operations\nGround Support Equipment\nSysten Engineering & Integration\nProgram Management\nLaunch Operations & On-Orbit Support\n\nSubsystems & Integration Total\n\nFalcon 9 (Vehicle & Services)\nTOTAL Spacecraft & LV\n\n3.3\n5.2\n\n35\n\n365.6\n6\n\nBackup\n\n7\n\nCost: NAFCOM Printout\nNAFCOM Cost Model\nWBS Cost Report\n2009 $M\nRisk Off\nEstimate Name:\nWBS Element\n\nPrepared By:\nVersion:\n\nDDT&&E\n\nTotal Vehicle\n\nD&&D\n\nSTH\n\nFlight Unit\n\n247.1\n\nStage 1\nStage 1 Subsystems\nStructures/Mechanisms\n\nProduction\n\nTotal\n\n83.6\n\n83.6\n\n330.8\n\n247.1\n98.6\n35.1\n\n74.4\n29.4\n\n24.3\n5.7\n\n83.6\n36.9\n7.6\n\n83.6\n36.9\n7.6\n\n330.8\n135.6\n42.7\n\n6.7\n\n5.8\n\n1.0\n\n3.2\n\n3.2\n\n9.9\n\nElectrical Power and Distribution\n\n18.3\n\n14.2\n\n4.1\n\n8.2\n\n8.2\n\n26.6\n\nCommand & Data Handling\n\n11.2\n\n5.9\n\n5.3\n\n4.0\n\n4.0\n\n15.2\n\nCommunications\n\n5.2\n\n3.9\n\n1.3\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n6.2\n\nAttitude Control\n\n11.7\n\n7.3\n\n4.5\n\n8.9\n\n8.9\n\n20.6\n\n4.1\n\n2.9\n\n1.1\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n5.6\n\n6.3\n\n5.0\n\n1.3\n\nPropulsion\n\nCabling\nThermal Control\nStage 1 System Integration\nIntegration, Assembly and Checkout (IACO)\nSystem Test Operations (STO)\nGround Support Equipment (GSE)\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n8.8\n\n51.4\n\n15.9\n\n15.9\n\n67.3\n\n9.1\n13.7\n\n7.4\n\n7.4\n\n16.5\n13.7\n\n4.2\n\n4.2\n\nTooling\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nME/GSE\n\n3.8\n\nSystem Engineering & Integration (SE&&I)\nProgram Management\nLOOS\n\n3.8\n\n7.9\n\n3.3\n\n3.3\n\n11.2\n\n13.3\n\n5.2\n\n5.2\n\n18.5\n\n3.2\n\n3.2\n\nFee\n\n15.0\n\n5.3\n\nProgram Support\n\n33.0\n\n11.6\n\nWednesday, March 11, 2009\n\nC:\\Program Files\\NAFCOMv2007\\Xenia Est 1.xls\n\n5.3\n\n20.3\n\n11.6\n44.6\nShaded areas indicate thruput values\n\nPage 1 of 2\n\n8\n\nCost: NAFCOM Printout\nEstimate Name:\nWBS Element\n\nPrepared By:\nVersion:\n\nDDT&&E\n\nContingency\n\nD&&D\n\nSTH\n\nFlight Unit\n\nProduction\n\nTotal\n\n39.6\n\n13.9\n\n13.9\n\n53.5\n\n9.5\n\nVehicle Level Integration\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n9.5\n\nDDT&&E (Design, Development, Test &&\nEngineering)\nD&&D\n(Design && Development)\n\nDDT&&E = D&&D + STH\nTotal\n= DDT&&E +\nProduction\n\nShaded areas indicate thruput values\n\nWednesday, March 11, 2009\n\nC:\\Program Files\\NAFCOMv2007\\Xenia Est 1.xls\n\nPage 2 of 2\n\n9\n\n'
