In the flight simulation laboratory at Ames Research Center, it has been determined that these delays have an adverse influence on pilot performance during aggressive tasks such as nap-of-the-earth (NOE) maneuvers. Using contemporary equipment, computer-generated image (CGI) time delays are an unavoidable consequence of the operations required for scene generation. However, providing that magnitide distortions at higher frequencies are tolerable, delay compensation is possible over a restricted frequency range. This range, assumed to have an upper limit of perhaps 10 or 15 rad/sec, conforms approximately to the bandwidth associated with helicopter handling qualities research. A compensation algorithm is introduced here and evaluated in terms of tradeoffs in frequency responses. The algorithm has a discrete basis and accommodates both a large, constant transport delay interval and a periodic delay interval, as associated with asynchronous operations.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880003550, "id": "3faa5e1598bb459bba0cee1b483420c1", "publicationDate": "1986-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880003550.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880003550/downloads/19880003550.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880003550/downloads/19880003550.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880003550/downloads/19880003550.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
