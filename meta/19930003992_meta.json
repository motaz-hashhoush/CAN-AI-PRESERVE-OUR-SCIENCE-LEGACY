It has the proven capability to deploy a satellite from an orbiting Shuttle that is 18 inches in diameter, 31 inches long, and weighing 190 pounds. These DSI Launchers were used aboard the Discovery (STS-39) in May 1991 as part of the Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) to deploy three small satellites known as Chemical Release Observation (CRO) satellites A, B, and C. Because the satellites contained hazardous liquids (MMH, UDMH, and MON-10) and were launched from GAS Cylinders without motorized doors, the launchers were required to pass NASA Shuttle Payload safety and verification requirements. Some of the more interesting components of the design were the V-band retention and separation mechanism, the separation springs, and the launcher electronics which provided a properly inhibited release sequence operated through the Small Payload Accommodations Switch Panel (SPASP) on board the Orbiter. The original plan for this launcher was to use a motorized door. The launcher electronics, therefore has the capability to be modified to accommodate the door, if desired.", "title": "The DSI small satellite launcher", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:42:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930003992, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nichols, S."}, "organization": {"name": "Defense Systems, Inc.", "location": "McLean, VA, United States"}}, "id": "73a70ce130b24698ba7dd95b9c27349c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930003992, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gibbons, D."}, "organization": {"name": "Defense Systems, Inc.", "location": "McLean, VA, United States"}}, "id": "4179db4c16d54a6dba489dd8f7787ea3"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19930003992, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wise, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Defense Systems, Inc.", "location": "McLean, VA, United States"}}, "id": "5aa15ffaaa844596b8071a43c8f3fd92"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19930003992, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nguyen, D."}, "organization": {"name": "Defense Systems, Inc.", "location": "McLean, VA, United States"}}, "id": "363a32a372274b739f6e7111368ed9d8"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930003992, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930003992, "id": "60b5f58b9f8140fdae1f5cbbab3aa2f2", "publicationName": "NASA.
