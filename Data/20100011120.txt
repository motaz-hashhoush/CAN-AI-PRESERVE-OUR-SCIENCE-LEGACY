b'Ka-Band Radar Terminal Descent Sensor\nRadar altimeter/velocimeter improves velocity sensing by an order of magnitude and eliminates\nangle-of-descent errors.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThe terminal descent sensor (TDS) is a\nradar altimeter/velocimeter that improves\nthe accuracy of velocity sensing by more\nthan an order of magnitude when compared to existing sensors. The TDS is designed for the safe planetary landing of\npayloads, and may be used in helicopters\nand fixed-wing aircraft requiring high-accuracy velocity sensing.\nThe TDS uses 35.75-GHz frequency to\noptimize accuracy without requiring\nnew technology, and incorporates a millimeter-wave center frequency to eliminate angle-of-arrival errors that can result in large velocity errors over\nnon-homogeneous terrain. A memoryless approach to altimetry reacquires the\ntarget on each beam for each unique\nmeasurement, overcoming problems of\nambiguous measurements or high dynamics that have plagued previous altimeter designs. The independent\nbeam-to-beam and repeat-beam performance avoids \xe2\x80\x9closs of lock\xe2\x80\x9d problems,\nas well as any issue where the heat shield,\nor an anomaly of some sort, might put\nthe radar in a false state.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9csky-crane\xe2\x80\x9d concept developed\nfor the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory\n(MSL) mission allows the delivery of\nmuch larger payloads than the previ-\n\nThe TDS RF Design consists of a receiver rack\ndrawer, a frequency synthesizer rack drawer,\nand an upconverter/downconverter.\n\nously developed airbag landing methods, and it overcomes the problems of\negress that pallet landers traditionally\nhave faced. The system requires high-accuracy velocity on a minimum of three\nindependent beams, high-accuracy slant\nrange measurements on all velocimeter\nbeams, and performance over an aggressive range of vehicle dynamics, includ-\n\ning high attitude excursions, high attitude rates, and high attitude vehicle velocities. Also necessary are knowledge\nand control of the touchdown vehicle\nvelocity: the MSL rover requires less\nthan 1.5-m/s vertical and 0.75-m/s horizontal velocities at touchdown. This altimeter/velocimeter innovation can\nmeet these needs, enabling the skycrane concept.\nAt the time of this reporting, the TDS\nwas in breadboard form, and was a single-channel, Ka-band model created\nwith a commercial-off-the shelf (COTS)\nantenna, connectorized RF components, miniature Ka-band RF hybrids in\nsmall, connectorized packages for the\nT/R module, and a LabVIEW/laptop interface. The RF design is shown in the\nfigure. The equipment has been verified\nwith bench testing that included shortpulse generation, Doppler/velocity\nproduct generation, FPGA (field-programmable-gate-array) timing, RF power\nlevels, and RF passband response.\nThis work was done by Brian Pollard, Andrew Berkun, Michael Tope, Constantine Andricos, Joseph Okonek, and Yunling Lou of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1).

These sensors are intended to supplant older\nelectrochemical pH sensors that include\nglass electrode structures and reference\nsolutions. The older sensors are fragile\nand subject to drift. The present developmental solid-state sensors are more\nrugged and are expected to be usable in\nharsh environments.\nLike the older electrochemical pH sensors, the present sensors are based on a differential-electrode measurement principle. Each sensor includes two electrodes,\nmade of different materials, in equilibrium\n\n6\n\nwith the solution of interest. The electrode\nmaterials are chosen so that the electric potential of one electrode is sensitive (or\nmore sensitive) to the pH of the solution of\ninterest while the electric potential of the\nother electrode is insensitive (or less sensitive) to the pH of the solution. One measures the difference between the potentials\non the two electrodes and deduces the pH\nfrom the known relationship between that\ndifference and the pH.\nOne of the electrodes of a pH sensor\nof the present type is an iridium wire that\nhas been partially oxidized to have a surface layer of iridium oxide about 15 \xc2\xb5m\nthick. The other electrode is a rhodium\nfoil that has been similarly treated to im-\n\npart a surface layer of rhodium oxide\nabout 5 \xc2\xb5m thick.\nIn calibration tests, the dependence of\nthe electric potential of the iridium/iridium oxide electrode upon pH was found\nto closely approximate that predicted by\nthe Nernst equation, at a slope between\n\xe2\x80\x9357 and \xe2\x80\x9359 mV/pH. The dependence of\nthe\nelectric\npotential\nof\nthe\nrhodium/rhodium oxide electrode upon\npH was found to be sub-Nernstian, at a\nslope of about \xe2\x80\x9326 mV/pH. Hence, in\nconstructing a pH sensor, iridium/iridium\noxide was used for the sensing (more-sensitive) electrode and rhodium/rhodium\noxide for the reference (less-sensitive)\nelectrode. When the difference between\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, October 2007\n\n0.25\n\n0.20\n\nPotential, V\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\x930.05\n\n\xe2\x80\x930.10\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n6\n\n10\n\n12\n\npH\n\nDifferences Between the Potentials of an iridium/iridium oxide electrode and a rhodium/rhodium\noxide electrode were measured when the electrodes were in equilibrium with solutions having several different pH values.\n\nthe potentials of the two electrodes was\nmeasured as a function of pH, the slope\nwas found to be about \xe2\x80\x9330 mV/pH (see\nfigure). This slope is well within the range\nof typical instrumentation used in converting DC signals to digital data for recording.\nThis work was done by William West, Martin Buehler, and Didier Keymeulen of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517, the\ncontractor has elected to retain title to this invention.

It has been\nestimated that, in some cases, it would\nbe possible to increase sensitivity by\nabout half or to reduce measurement\ntime correspondingly.\nThe pertinent aspects of the problems of design and fabrication can be\nsummarized as follows: In general, to increase the sensitivity of a SQUID magnetometer, it is necessary to maximize\nthe magnetic flux enclosed by the sensing coil while minimizing the self-inductance of this coil. It is often beneficial to\nfabricate the coil from a thicker wire to\nreduce its self-inductance. Moreover, to\noptimize the design of the coil with respect to sensitivity, it may be necessary\nto shape the wire to other than a commonly available circular or square crosssection. On the other hand, it is not\npractical to use thicker superconducting wire for the entire superconducting\ncircuit, especially if the design of a specific device requires a persistent-current\nloop enclosing a remotely placed\nSQUID sensor.
