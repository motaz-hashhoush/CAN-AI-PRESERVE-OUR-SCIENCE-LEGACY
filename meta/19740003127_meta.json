The buoy is designed to operate for a minimum of 1 year providing position and environmental data through polar-orbiting satellite telecommunications. It can be deployed by a two or three man crew using a small aircraft. It is capable of operating in both free-floating and frozen-in situations. An experimental unit successfully completed a 5-month test at Fletcher's Ice Island (T-3) during the winter of 1971-72 and six units were deployed in the Arctic during the spring of 1972. Results to data have demonstrated the utility of the basic design, the effectiveness of the satellite communications, and the feasibility of deploying and operating a large array of such buoy systems in the Arctic Ocean.", "title": "The Arctic data buoy.
