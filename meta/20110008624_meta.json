It is known that current KSC cryogenic technology results in only approximately 55 % of purchased hydrogen being used. The rest is lost at various points in the process: transfer from transporting vehicle to tank, storage tank boil off, and from the tank to the intended propulsion tanks. Project H's goals would be to have local hydrogen production and liquifaction capability, and to increase the efficiency of hydrogen operations to greater than 80 %. The project envisions two phases: Phase 1 will build a smaller scale demonstration system, and phase 2 will build a full scale spaceport system. This initial project has proposed ideas for local hydrogen production, gaseous distribution, integrated refrigeration and storage, and high efficiency transfer lines that merit further investigation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20110008624, "name": "Ground Hydrogen Symposium", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL", "id": "19e8a12c8c5c414397c34f5929d3ed8e"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110008624, "id": "a5476af3709a47b49ccbe73497083c3e", "publicationDate": "2011-02-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110008624.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110008624/downloads/20110008624.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110008624/downloads/20110008624.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110008624/downloads/20110008624.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
