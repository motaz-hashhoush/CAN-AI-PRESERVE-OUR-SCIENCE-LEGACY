However, as the head 36 is po-~\nTherefore, it should readily be apparent that the\nsitioned over the upstream end of a suspected leak, the\ncompression spring 70 is insulated from and biases the\ninterior of the housing 12 is evacuated through the tub-\n\n3,859,845\nirig\'38 and the head 36. Evacuation, of course, causes\nthe pressure within the housing to drop. This drop or\nreduction in pressure within the housing 12 causes the\nwall 26 to flex inwardly for thereby forcing the cap 56\nto advance along a linear path toward the fixed cap 54 5\nagainst the applied forces of the compression spring 70.\nSuch motion of the cap 56 causes the pair of contacts\n50 to become engaged, whereupon the circuit 46 is\nreconfigured to a closed circuit. Closing of the circuit\n46 causes the lamp 42 to become illuminated as electri- 10\ncal potential is applied thereacross from the source of\npotential 48.\nIn the event a tension spring 72, as illustrated in FIG.\n5, is employed for maintaining the contacts 50 in an engaged relationship, for maintaining the circuit closed, 15\nthe normalized configuration of the circuit is a closed\ncircuit configuration.-Consequently, when the head 36\nis applied at the downstream end of the suspected leak,\nin a manner such that pressure is increased within the\nhousing 12, the wall 26 is displaced outwardly, against 20\nthe applied forces of the spring 72. This motion causes\nthe contacts 50 to become disengaged, whereupon the\ncircuit is. reconfigured to an open circuit for thereby extinguishing the lamp 42.\nThe valve 74 is adjusted so that the normalized cir- 25\ncuit configuration is barely maintained in the presence\nof the leak. Since the valve is a calibrated valve, the\nrate of the detected leak can be determined as the pressure is varied within the housing 12 at a rate such that\nthe circuit is maintained on the verge of being recon- 30\nfigured.\nIn view of the foregoing, it is to be understood that\nthe detector 10 of the present invention provides a\npractical leak detector particularly suited for use \xe2\x80\xa2\naboard a spacecraft in verifying loss of cabin pressure 35\nand the like.\nAlthough the invention has been herein shown and\ndescribed in what is conceived to be the most practical\nand preferred embodiment, it is recognized that depar40\n\n45\n\n50\'\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\ntures may be made therefrom within the scope of the\ninvention, which is not to be limited to the illustrative\ndetails disclosed.\nI claim:\n1.
