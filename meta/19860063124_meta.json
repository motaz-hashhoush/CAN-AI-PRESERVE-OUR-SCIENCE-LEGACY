An attempt is reported to detect emission at decameter wavelengths during the International Halley Watch trial run on Comet P/Crommelin in March 1984. No plasma effects in the tail were observed either at visible or at radio wavelengths. Assuming free-free emission from an optically thin gas, the observations make it possible to place an upper limit in the range from 560 to 8900 electrons per cu cm on the electron density in the tail. The Teepee Tee array employed in the investigations has a frequency coverage of 15-125 MHz, and a sensitivity of approximately 1 Jy, (the highest currently available from the ground at low frequencies).", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "66", "submissionId": 19860063124, "issn": "0019-1035", "id": "77008b1d7b84452ebef1bf2ea9404892", "publicationName": "Icarus", "publicationDate": "1986-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
