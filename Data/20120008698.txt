Extending from 95 to 141\ndegrees East longitude and from 6 degrees North to 11 degrees South latitude. Further the\nmarket of the Space Solar Power/SPS must be worldwide, including Indonesia. As we know,\nit can provide electricity anywhere in the world from the Earth's orbit, mostly Indonesia an\nequator country. We have to perform case studies of various countries to understand their\nbenefits and disadvantages provided by the SSP, because each country has much different\ncondition on energy from other countries. We are at the moment starting the international\ncollaboration between Indonesia and Japan to carry out the case study for Indonesia. We\nunderstand that in Indonesia itself each province has much different micro-climate between\none province compared to the other. In Japan, METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and\nIndustry) has already organized a committee to investigate the feasibility of Space Solar\nPower and to make a plan to launch a space demonstration of the SPS. While, Indonesia is\nquickly developing economy and increasing their energy demand. We are investigating the\ndetailed energy conditions of Indonesia, the benefits and disadvantages of the Space Solar\nPower for Indonesia. Especially, we will perform the investigation on the receiving system\nfor the Japanese pilot Space Power Satellite.\n\n0 The ADS is Operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical ObservatoU under NASA Grant\nNNX09AB39G\n\n1 of 1\t\n\n5/14/2012 11:15 AM\n\n"
