b'emote sensing technology offers a broad\nspectrum of opportunities that could lead to\nnew commercial products or processes of\nbenefit to the nation as a whole and to individual companies. However, although sales o\nf\nrise, the government is still the principal market for such data;\nmercial remote sensing in the national interest,\nsigned to promote greater awareness among\nd to provide basic training in the commercial\nisms is the Visiting Investigator Program\n\n.\n\nI\n\nLU\n\n4\n\nLU\n\nU\nU\n\na\nI\n\nI\n\nENVIRONI\'IEN 1-\n\nAND R S U C S\nEORE\nMANAGEPIENT\n\nable to integrate remote sensing into their\ns, or to improve existing product lines.\n%g~flzing that such companies generally have limited resources to invest in exploring new\n;$ethnologies, VIP offers a chance for a firm to expand its capabilities on a low-risk basis; VIP\ncosts them nothing but their own employees\' travel expenses.\nA prospective VIP participant submits a proposal involving use of remote sensing in an\nactual project, detailing research objectives and outlining the commercial possibilities. If the\nproposal is accepted, Stennis Space Center acquires the necessary remote sensing data,\ninstructs company personnel in the use of remote sensing hardware and software, and prof\nvides guidance in executing the project. A typical project runs six to nine months; i it produces promising concepts, the potential exists for further NASA/company joint research.\nAn example of a VIP project is the experience of Community Coffee, Inc., Baton Rouge,\nLouisiana, an importer buying coffee primarily from Guatemala and Brazil. To maintain competitiveness, the company needs advance information about a growing area\'s crop yield and\nquality at the next harvest. But the information coming out of producing countries is usually\nsketchy and sometimes questionable. Looking for an efficient way of monitoring coffee growth\nand yield trends, Community Coffee undertook a VIP project involving the use of remote sensing data and Geographic Information System (GIs) technology as a means of tracking coffee\ngrowth and assessing crop health.\nStennis Space Center provided satellite imagery of an area in Guatemala and supplemented\nit with infrared aerial photography of the same area. Working with NASA remote sensing\nexperts, Community Coffee\'s George Guthrie, director of green coffee purchasing, enhanced\nthe imagery in a multistep process, adding ground reconnaissance information about the production of individual coffee fincas and surrounding environmental conditions, together with\nsuch GIs data as the location of urban areas, roads, contours, hydrography, etc. By computer\nprocessing, the investigators eventually produced a composite image o the area showing (by\nf\ncolor coding) the size and location of coffee-growingareas, along with a three-dimensional\nperspective of the same area.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThese products represented an experimental prototype of what Community Coffee hopes\nwill be an efficient system of forecasting coffee crops. Using satellite imagery, the company\nseeks to produce detailed maps that will separate coffee cropland from wild vegetation and\nshow information on the health of specific crops. This information is economically important.\nTimely knowledge that the coffee crop yield in a given area would be greater than average\ncould result in lower prices at harvest time;\nI\ntherefore, the company\'s buyers could delay\npurchases until prices drop. If satellite\nimagery indicates a lower than average crop,\nmeaning higher prices, Community Coffee\ncould turn to other coffee sources to hold\nprices down.\nCommunity Coffee\'s interest in remote\nsensing goes beyond procurement strategy.\nThe company is looking into the possibility of\nmarketing this sophisticated forecasting technique to other coffee buyers, or to coffee\nfarmers and government agricultural services, who could use the information to optimize application of fertilizers, pesticides and\nirrigation for maximal crop yields, minimal\npollution and lower production costs.\n\nA t lefi is an\nenhanced satellite\nimage of coffee\ngrowing oreas\nin a region of\nGuatemala, developed in a multistep\nland classification\nprocess that ruled\nout nowcoffee land\n(red) and highlighted coffee ficas\n(gray).

Industry investigators are\ngranted access to Stennis Space Center\'s\ncommercial remote sensing facilities and its\nsophisticated data processing hardware and\nsoftware. Working with NASA scientists in all\naspects of a project from planning through\nproduct development,partner companies\nbecome familiar with the theoretical and\npractical bases for remote sensing,\nairbornefspaceborne data acquisition,\nrelated instrumentation, and data\nanalysis techniques.\nWhile the primary aim of both N S and\nAA\nthe industry partner is commercialization of\nLandsat TM/ ~dc Mergl the technology, participation in the VIP program often leads to broader long term benefits. An example is the case of Scott Nesbit of\n12 meter resolution\nNesbit Environmental, Inc., Baton Rouge,\nLouisiana, whose VIP work led to a merger with a larger environmental consulting firm.\nNesbit\'s VIP project was an investigation of the potential of remote sensing for locating\nabandoned barges in the Louisiana coastal zone. Over the past 40 years, barges and other vessels have been abandoned in the channels and adjacent waterways of the Mississippi River, a\nmajor corridor for petrochemical transportation. These barges may become illegal disposal\nsites for used oil or hazardous materials, which may leak and cause serious pollution of the\nwaterways and coastal estuaries.\nHowever, locating abandoned barges is not easy. The vessels are scattered over a very\nwide area, seasonally covered by vegetation and undetectable; additionally, the job of differentiating active vessels from abandoned barges requires multiple observations showing the\nbarges anchored in the same location over a long period.\nSince 1989,the U.S. Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency have been conducting a program to locate abandoned barges that represent environmental risks. Nesbit\nEnvironmental\'s VIP project was an investigation to determine the detection capability and\ncost effectiveness of using the U.S. Geological Survey\'s Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR)\ntogether with the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), a satellite-based scanning instrument, and\npanchromatic data from the French SPOT remote sensing satellite. The effectiveness of these\ndata sources was to be determined by comparing their digital remotely-sensed data with color\ninfrared aerial photography.\nAssisted by Stennis Space Center experts, Nesbit initiated a process whereby aerial photography was employed as the principal data source with the SLAR, Landsat T and SPOT as\nM\n\n1\n1\n\nt\n\nYU\nENVIRONMENT\n\nAND RESOURCES\nMANAGEMENT\n\n1\n\nScott Nesbit of Nesbit Environmental is viewing aerial images\nof the Louisiana bayou through a stereoscopic viewer that\nallows easier and more definitive identrficationof features.\n\nA typical aerial image used in Nesbit\'s VIP project for locating\nabandoned barges in the waterways of the Mississippi\nRiver complex.\n\nsecondary sources for verification. To provide the abandonment time factor, SLAR and\nsatellite imagery acquired at several times\nfrom 1988 to 1994 was used. Potential vessel\nlocations were screen digitized to map coordinates for field checking.\nThe fivemonth investigation concluded\nthat a combination of aerial photography\nbacked by SLAR and satellite imagery offered\na cost-effective way of identifying potentially\nabandoned vessels for follow-up field check\nM\nby boat or plane. Although Landsat T data\nwere not very useful in initial barge detection\n(due to coarse resolution), the data were\nhelpful when merged with SLAR data to provide information regarding landlwater delineation. The advantages of combining color\ninfrared aerial\nwith s L data\n~\ninclude increasing the overall detection\ncapability by using an additional detection\nmethod, and providing multiple surveillance\ndates to verify abandonment costeffectively\n(due to the ready availability and low cost of\nSLAR data). The combined system offers\nincreased accuracy and reduced cost o\nf\nfollow-up inspections to determine the status of suspect vessels.\nThe VIP project not only achieved its primary objective and provided new technology for\nuse in barge detection, it also attracted the attention of C K Associates, Inc., also of Baton\nRouge, and led to a merger of Nesbit Environmental and C-K. Where C-K Associates had previously limited remotely-sensed data acquisition to aerial photography, the merged company\nhas since invested in Geographical Information System (GIs) hardware, software and technical\ntraining, and initiated the use o a GIs to process multiple sources of remotely-sensed data as\nf\nan on-line engineering tool.\n\nfi\n\nC\n\nYI\nENVIRONMENT\n\nAND RESOURCES\nMANAGEMENT\n\n'
