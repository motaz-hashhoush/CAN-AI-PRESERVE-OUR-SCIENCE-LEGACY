b"1 - 1\n\nOcean Observation Instrument\n\nor development of imaging\nsatellites, NASA employs\naircraft-based multispectral\nimagers to simulate the characteristics of a next-generation\nsatellite's advanced instruments;\nflight testing enables developers\nto assess the capabilities of\ntheir instruments and make\ndesign changes early if they\nare required. One such\nprogram involved use of\n\nA BOON TO COMMERCIAL FISHING FLEETS\nEMERGED FROM\nNASA DEVELOPMENT\nOF A RESEARCH\nINSTRUMENT\n\nSince there is a distinct\ncorrelation between chlorophyll\ncontent and fish concentration,\nAOCI had obvious commercial\npotential as a real-time means\nof providing fishing fleets information about fish locations.\nA commercialization effort\nwas begun in 1988 under the\nauspices of NASA's Earth\nObservations Commercial\nApplications Program. The\nproject was co-funded\nby NASA, Daedalus,\nNational Marine Fisheries\nServices, Zapata Haynie\nCorporation, Hammond,\nLouisiana, one of the\nlargest U.S. commercial\nfishing companies, and\nSpectroScan Inc., Coral\nGables, Florida. The\nlatter company planned\nto use AOCI to offer\nairborne multispectral\nremote sensing services\non a commercial basis.\nThe commercialization\nprogram included a number of\ntechnical improvements to the\nAOCI, development of new\n\np.\nan Airborne Ocean Color\nImager (AOCI) as a simulator\nfor an advanced oceanographic\nsatellite instrument.\nThe AOCI (above) was\ndeveloped under a NASA Small\nBusiness Innovation Research\ncontract by Daedalus Enterprises, Inc., Ann Arbor, Michigan in\nthe mid-1980s. The AOCI\nmeasures water temperature\nand detects water color in nine\nwavelengths. Water color is anindication of the water's chlorophyll content, or the presence\nof phytoplankton. In 1986, the\nprototype AOCI was delivered\nto Ames Research Center and\nused for flight investigations\nover ocean, coastal and freshwater sites, compiling data for\nscientists studying the effects of\nchanging coastal landscapes on\nphytoplankton production.\nE n v i r o n m e n t a n d R e s o u r c e s Management\n\ndata processing procedures to\npermit near-real-time processing, and new data dissemination techniques to get the\ninformation to fishermen on\na timely basis. A series of\ndemonstration flights was\nconducted in 1990/91 over the\nGulf of Mexico (the drawing\nbelow illustrates the type of\ncoverage provided by the AOCI\nmounted in the high altitude\naircraft used for the tests). The\ntests demonstrated conclusively\n.that AOCI could provide\nbeneficial assistance to\ncommercial fishing operations.\nAOCI was successfully\ncommercialized in 1992 with\ndelivery of the first unit to an\nItalian company. Daedalus\nEnterprises continues to\nmarket the system worldwide\nin two versions, one for\ncommercial fishing uses and\none for oceanographic\nresearch conducted primarily\nby government agencies.\n\n7\n\nC\n\n"
