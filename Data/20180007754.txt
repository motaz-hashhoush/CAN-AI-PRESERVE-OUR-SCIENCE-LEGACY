Frisbee)\n\xe2\x80\x93 Mean states and covariances arise from an estimation process\n\xe2\x80\x93 Pc just a calculation from these products\n\xe2\x80\x93 Pc simply compared to a threshold, and appropriate actions follow\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 However, as soon as estimated results compared to a threshold, the\nsituation becomes a statistics problem\n\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cCritical region\xe2\x80\x9d defined (here Pc area above threshold)\n\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cConfidence interval\xe2\x80\x9d sought (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the true likelihood that the Pc is above\nthe threshold?\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\xe2\x80\x93 Ancillary circumstances can prevent direct comparison (e.g., poor OD)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Evokes similarity to hypothesis test\xe2\x80\x94if no comparison possible, then one remains\nwith the null hypothesis (not to maneuver)\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 If it looks, smells, and quacks like a statistics problem . . .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Advantages to be gained if full formalisms of statistics problems\nused\nHejduk/Snow | CA Risk Assessment Approaches | 6\n\nSetting the Null Hypothesis\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There appears to be no single mandated method for framing the null\nhypothesis\n\xe2\x80\x93 Most guidance recommends the \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cordinary\xe2\x80\x9d outcome to be the null\nhypothesis\n\xe2\x80\x93 Should be where \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption\xe2\x80\x9d lies, meaning the burden of proof falls on the\nalternative hypothesis\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fundamental question\n\xe2\x80\x93 Do the presented data provide evidence to justify a decision to maneuver?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Null hypothesis\n\xe2\x80\x93 The miss distance is greater than the HBR\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Alternative hypothesis\n\xe2\x80\x93 The miss distance is less than the HBR\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Similar flexibility available for Type I / Type II error assignment\n\xe2\x80\x93 Nuisance state typically assigned to Type I error (false alarm)\n\xe2\x80\x93 Process oversight assigned to Type II error (missed detection)\nHejduk/Snow | CA Risk Assessment Approaches | 7\n\nSetting the Null Hypothesis:\nOther CA Publications\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Early publication by Coppola introduced the following definition of\ncollision:\n\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cThe miss distance is less than or equal to the HBR\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 R. Carpenter, in Wald test and ASA paper (which included M. Hejduk\nas coauthor), used this as null hypothesis\n\xe2\x80\x93 Remediation thus set as the default position\n\xe2\x80\x93 Null hypothesis rejected if Pc < small threshold\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Issue: places presumption with the unusual action\n\xe2\x80\x93 In the absence of compelling evidence to maneuver, CARA presumes that not\nmaneuvering is the safer choice\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Way of considering inherent risks of maneuvering and other intangibles\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Could be construed to require a maneuver for cases in which poor data quality\nindicates questionable actionability\n\nHejduk/Snow | CA Risk Assessment Approaches | 8\n\nHypothesis Testing:\nApplication to CA (1 of 2)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In CARA, we implicitly embrace the following null hypothesis:\n\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cThe miss distance (MD) between the two objects is greater than or equal to\nthe combined HBR\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x93 Some practitioners ascribe importance to the placement of the equals sign\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Since very rare for MD, as a continuous variable, to equal HBR exactly, placement of\nequals sign not significant here\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 We reject this null hypothesis and recommend a maneuver if all of\nthe following are true:\n\xe2\x80\x93 The Pc is greater than the established threshold\n\xe2\x80\x93 The primary and secondary ODs (state and covariance) are well determined\n\xe2\x80\x93 The space weather situation is sufficiently stable\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If any of the above conditions are not met, we cannot justify\nrejecting the null hypothesis\n\xe2\x80\x93 Burden of proof is thus borne by the decision to maneuver; refraining from a\nmaneuver is the default\nHejduk/Snow | CA Risk Assessment Approaches | 9\n\nHypothesis Testing:\nApplication to CA (2 of 2)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mean (estimated) miss distance < HBR\n\xe2\x80\x93 Some practitioners (Alfano, Carpenter) appear to counsel a remediation action\nin such cases, regardless of the Pc value\n\xe2\x80\x93 With this approach, null Hypothesis would thus have two conditions\n\xe2\x80\xa2 One statistical \xe2\x80\x93 the probability of the miss distance being less than the HBR\n\xe2\x80\xa2 One deterministic \xe2\x80\x93 the value of the miss distance estimate itself\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Can result in maneuvers for very low Pc events\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If Pc is low, produces little, if any, reduction in statistical risk\n\xe2\x80\xa2 May result in a large reduction of political risk: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you maneuver when a\ncollision (i.e. miss distance < HBR) was predicted?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Occurs very rarely in operations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 From CARA database, roughly 0.005% of events have miss distance less than 20m\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Thus makes little difference whether or not included\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If used in risk assessment process, would be essentially for political\npurposes only\n\nHejduk/Snow | CA Risk Assessment Approaches | 10\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cDilution Region\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Two ways in which a Pc can be low\n\xe2\x80\x93 Positions of both objects can be very well determined (smallish covariances),\nso the set of MDs assumes a bounded and relatively small set of values\n\xe2\x80\xa2 One can then decisively conclude that the likelihood that the MD < HBR is low\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Positions of both objects can be very poorly determined (largish covariances),\nso the set of MDs could assume a very large and broad set of values\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Given this broad set of possibilities, the portion of those MDs expected to fall within\nthe HBR is small, so the Pc is low\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dilution region is the region for which the latter is true\n\xe2\x80\x93 Determined by considering the ratio of the miss distance to covariance size\n\xe2\x80\x93 When this ratio greater than \xe2\x88\x9a2, in dilution region\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Typical event development\n\xe2\x80\x93 In dilution region when first discovered (large covariances due to long prop)\n\xe2\x80\x93 Moves to \xe2\x80\x9crobust\xe2\x80\x9d region as prop times decrease and covariances shrink\n\nHejduk/Snow | CA Risk Assessment Approaches | 11\n\nDilution and Robust Region Graph\n\nCollision event:\nPc trending\ntowards unity\nDilution Region\n\nPc\n\nRobust Region\n\nMiss event:\nPc trending\ntowards zero\n\nMahalanobis Distance\n\nHejduk/Snow | CA Risk Assessment Approaches | 12\n\nRisk Assessment\nby (Robust or Dilution) Region\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Robust region\n\xe2\x80\x93 If Pc is high, can conclude that situation is risky\n\xe2\x80\x93 If Pc is low, can conclude that situation is safe\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dilution region\n\xe2\x80\x93 If Pc is high, can conclude that situation is risky\n\xe2\x80\x93 If Pc is low, cannot actually draw a conclusion\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In particular, CANNOT conclude that the situation is safe, only that we know too little\nabout the situation to determine definitively whether risky or safe\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Appropriate action for low Pc in dilution region determined by\nchosen form of null hypothesis\n\xe2\x80\x93 Inadequate grounds to reject null hypothesis\n\xe2\x80\x93 If null hypothesis is not to maneuver, then no maneuver warranted\n\xe2\x80\x93 If null hypothesis is to maneuver, then maneuver warranted\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Some argue this is the appropriate safer course\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Of course, selection of maneuver impaired by these same problems\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 CARA practice is not to maneuver in such cases\nHejduk/Snow | CA Risk Assessment Approaches | 13\n\nDilution Region and the Space Fence\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Concern expressed regarding large number of expected dilution\nregion conjunctions with Space-Fence-only objects\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If SF covariances realistic (even if large), problem self-correcting\n\xe2\x80\x93 If in dilution region and Pc high enough to exceed threshold, then should\nremediate\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Diluted event still clears threshold, so no question about how to proceed\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 If in dilution region and Pc below threshold, then not enough information\navailable to justify an act of remediation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Presumes CARA-recommended formulation of null hypothesis;
