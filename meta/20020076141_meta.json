Several Langley Research Center innovations instrumental to the development of the aircraft include knowledge of how to reduce engine and other noise for passengers and terminal residents, increased use of lightweight aerospace composite structures for increased fuel efficiency and range, and wind tunnel tests confirming the structural integrity of 777 wing-airframe integration. Test results from Marshall Space Flight Center aimed at improving the performance of the Space Shuttle engines led to improvements in the airplane's new, more efficient jet engines. Finally, fostered by Ames Research Center, the Boeing 777 blankets that protect areas of the plane from high temperatures and fire have a lineage to Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation used on certain areas of the Space Shuttle. According to Boeing Company estimates, the 777 has captured three-quarters of new orders for airplanes in its class since the program was launched.", "title": "Innovations in Aircraft Design", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020076141, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020076141, "isbn": "0-16-049155-X", "id": "bbdd3fed9f564c28b3533b4c12b6fef2", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1997", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020076141.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020076141/downloads/20020076141.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020076141/downloads/20020076141.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020076141/downloads/20020076141.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
