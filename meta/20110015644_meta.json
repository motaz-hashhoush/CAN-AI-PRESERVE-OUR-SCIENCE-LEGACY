Approximately 24,325 lines of PCG2 code was converted to SCL yielding a 90% reduction in the number of lines of code as many of the functions and scripts utilized in SCL could be ported and reused. Automated standalone testing, simulating the actual production environment, was performed in order to generalize and gauge the relative time it takes for SCL to update and write a given display. The use of SCL rules, functions, and scripts allowed the creation of several test cases permitting the detection of the amount of time it takes update a given set of measurements given the change in a globally existing CUI or CUI. It took the SCL system an average 926.09 ticks to update the entire display of 323 measurements.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110015644, "id": "8f7044c141464d3cbaf63a1e21d60153", "publicationDate": "2008-09-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110015644.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110015644/downloads/20110015644.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110015644/downloads/20110015644.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110015644/downloads/20110015644.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
