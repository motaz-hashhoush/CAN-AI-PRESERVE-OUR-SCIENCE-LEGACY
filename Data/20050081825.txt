Buehrle\nNASA Langley Research Center\nMail Stop 463\nHampton, VA 23681\nAnd\nKathy Kappus\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center\nHuntsville, AL 35812\nABSTRACT\nIn November of 2003 a rollout test was performed to gain a better understanding of the dynamic environment\nfor the Space Shuttle during transportation from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad. This was\npart of a study evaluating the methodology for including the rollout dynamic loads in the Space Shuttle fatigue\nlife predictions. The rollout test was conducted with a partial stack consisting of the Crawler Transporter,\nMobile Launch Platform, and the Solid Rocket Boosters with an interconnecting crossbeam. Instrumentation\nincluded over 100 accelerometers. Data was recorded for steady state speeds, start-ups and stops, and\nambient wind excitations with the vehicle at idle. This paper will describe the operating deflection shape\nanalysis performed using the measured acceleration response data. The response data for the steady state\nspeed runs were dominated by harmonics of the forcing frequencies, which were proportional to the vehicle\nspeed. Assuming a broadband excitation for the wind, analyses of the data sets with the vehicle at idle were\nused to estimate the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. Comparisons of the measured\nmodal properties with numerical predictions are presented.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Space Shuttle Orbiter is mated to the External Tank (ET) and Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) on top of a\nMobile Launch Platform (MLP) in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). A Crawler Transporter (CT) [1] is\nused to lift the nearly 12 million pound MLP-Space Shuttle assembly and carry it to one of the two launch\ncomplexes, which are approximately 3 to 4 miles away. The average duration of the transportation process is\n6.4 hours with the CT reaching top speeds of 0.9 miles per hour.\nA test was conducted in November of 2003 to gain a better understanding of the dynamic environment and to\nevaluate the methodology used to develop load spectra associated with the rollout mission phase for\ncertification of Space Shuttle Orbiter life. Figure 1 shows the partial stack test configuration used in the\nNovember 2003 test. This configuration has the MLP with the loaded SRBs and External Tank (ET) cross\nbeam on the CT. Acceleration, strain, wind, and hydraulic pressure measurements were acquired during the\ntransport process. Data was collected for variations in CT operations including starts, stops, turns, speed\nvariations, and ambient wind excitations with the CT at idle to evaluate the sensitivity of the response to the\ninput forcing frequency. This report will focus on the operating deflection shape (ODS) analysis of the 111\nchannels of accelerometer data. Assuming a broadband wind excitation for the CT idle data sets, the ODS\nanalyses were used to estimate the natural frequencies and mode shapes for numerical model validation.\nThe test setup, CT operating conditions, ODS results, and comparisons with the numerical predictions are\npresented.\n\nET cross beam\n\nSRB\n\nMLP\n\nCT\n\nFigure 1.

ODS measurement model.\n\nMEASUREMENT MODEL\nThe locations of the 37 triaxial sets of accelerometers are shown in Figure 2. For reference, the measurement\nmodel in Figure 2 is approximately aligned with the photograph in Figure 1. The ground support equipment\n(GSE) coordinate system is shown in Figure 2, which has XGSE in the lateral direction, YGSE in the direction of\ntravel, and ZGSE in the vertical direction. Three triaxial sets of accelerometers were located on each of the\nSRBs. The left hand (LH) SRB has measurement position 1 at the tip and 3 at the base. Points 21-24 are\nlocated on the four hold down attachments for the LH SRB. Similarly, for the right hand (RH) SRB,\nmeasurement point 4 is at the tip and 6 at the base with points 17-20 on the hold down attachments.\nMeasurement points 13-16 are at approximately the midpoints between corners of the MLP upper level and\nmeasurement points 7-12 are located on the MLP lower level. Points 7 and 8 are duplicates of points 9 and\n10, respectively. The accelerometers at points 9 and 10 are part of the nominal transducer set used during\nactual Space Shuttle rollouts. At the four MLP to CT interface points, measurement points 26-29 are on the\nMLP side and points 30-33 are on the CT side of the interface. Measurement point 38 is at the center of the\nCT chassis. At each of the CT to MLP interfaces, the CT has four hydraulic cylinders that are used for\njacking, equalizing and leveling (JEL) during the transport process. The measurement points 30-33 are\nlocated above the JEL cylinders and points 34-37 are located at the base of the cylinders. Point 25 refers to\nthe SRB hold down post strains and is not included in the accelerometer based measurement model.\nROLLOUT TESTS\nData was acquired during two days of rollout testing for the partial stack configuration. This included a series\nof steady state speeds from 0.5 to 0.9 miles per hour (mph), transient start-ups and stops, and ambient wind\nexcitations with the CT at idle. For the steady state and ambient excitation conditions, data was typically\nrecorded for 600 seconds with a time step of .00195 seconds. All accelerometer data used in the ODS\nanalyses were simultaneously sampled and recorded using a 128-channel data acquisition system.\nAs will be illustrated in the results, the response spectra for the steady state data were dominated by the\nforcing frequencies [2] and harmonics associated with the CT speed. Therefore, for the purpose of estimating\nmodal properties, ODS analyses concentrated on the ambient data sets. The ambient excitation data sets\nare described in Table 1. For the ambient data acquisition periods, the CT system was in an idle condition. A\nrandom excitation is assumed for these data sets.\n\nTest File\nT020201\nT021401\nT021801\nT031401\nT031901\nT034001\n\nTest Day\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n\nTable 1.

This is often used to evaluate the absolute dynamic behavior of a machine or structure\nunder operating conditions. At or near a resonant frequency, the ODS is dominated by the corresponding\nresonant mode shape. However, the response measurements may also contain strong forced response\ncomponents associated with the operating conditions. This can make it difficult to distinguish between the\nresonant and forced response components. Since the input forces are not measured, estimation of the modal\nproperties from response only measurements is generally restricted to cases where the input force can be\nassumed to be broadband. Assuming a broadband excitation, the modal properties can be estimated by\napplying parameter estimation routines refined for the response only data [4,5]. This analysis procedure is\nsometimes referred to as Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) [5].\nAs described in a companion paper [2], the acceleration response of the partial stack was dominated by\nstrong forced response frequencies and harmonics associated with the crawler transporter (CT) speed.\nTherefore, the CT constant speed data were highly dependent on the forcing function and not representative\nof a broadband excitation. The ambient wind data sets with the CT at idle were assumed to have a\nbroadband excitation. Two independent ODS (or OMA) analyses were used to estimate the modal properties\nfrom the ambient wind data sets.\n\nOne data analysis approach used the ODS techniques available in ME\xe2\x80\x99scope from Vibrant Technology [4] to\nestimate the modal properties from individual ambient data sets. Universal files were read in and processed\ninto ODS frequency response functions (FRFs). An ODS FRF consists of the autospectrum for the magnitude\nand the phase from the cross spectrum with the selected reference. For this data set, 16384 lines of\nresolution were used (delta-f=.015625 Hz). The mean response was removed from the time signals but no\nother filtering of the data was performed. Twenty linear averages were taken over a 600 second time record\nwith a 56% overlap. A Hanning window was used for the assumed random data. The reference degrees of\nfreedom (DOFs) were 4-X, Y, and Z (top of SRB). Peak picking was the predominant method for the ODS\nanalysis of the individual ambient data sets.\nFor the second data analysis approach, the first four ambient data records from Table 1 were combined into a\nsingle 1710-second record. The data was lowpass filtered to 15 Hz and then resampled to a 30 Hz sample\nfrequency. Then, a time domain parameter estimation technique available in the Bruel & Kjaer OMA software\n[5] was applied to estimate the modal parameters. Several references were investigated. The analysis was\nmost successful when using measurements on top of the SRB\xe2\x80\x99s (1-X, Y, Z; 4-X, Y, Z) as references.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe power spectral density for an accelerometer mounted on the MLP (point 7) in the direction of travel is\nshown in Figure 3 for crawler transporter (CT) speeds of 0.8 and 0.9 MPH. There was a dominant forcing\nfrequency proportional to the speed of the crawler transporter [2], such that a 0.8 MPH CT speed would result\nin the excitation of the first three harmonics of 0.8 Hz. As shown, the steady state speed data is dominated\nby the forcing frequencies and harmonics making it difficult to separate out modal frequencies. As an\nillustration of the response motion, an ODS for the 2.7 Hz frequency is shown in Figure 4. In animation, this\nshape appears to have combined pitch and yaw motion of the MLP with SRB bending out-of-phase with the\nMLP motion.\n0.01\n\n2.4 Hz\n1.6 Hz\n\n1.8 Hz\n\n0.8 Hz\n\n0.001\n\n2.7 Hz\n\n0.9 Hz\n\n100E-6\n\n10E-6\n\n1E-6\n\n100E-9\n0.2\n\n1\n\n1.8\n\n2.6\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n3.4\n\n4.2\n\nFigure 3.

The response is shown for the triaxial response transducer at the top of the right hand\nSRB. Assuming a broadband excitation, the dominant response peaks will correspond to natural frequencies\nof the system. The results of performing ODS analysis on the individual ambient data sets are presented in\nTable 2. All modes are not identified in each of the data sets indicating variations in the excitations and\nresponses between data sets, as indicated in Figures 5 and 6. There are also closely spaced modal\nfrequencies, which makes it difficult to resolve the modal properties.\n\n100E-6\n\n100E-6\n\n10E-6\n\n10E-6\n\n.61 Hz\n.45 Hz\n\n.47 Hz\n.61 Hz\n.67 Hz\n\n1E-6\n\n1E-6\n\n.67 Hz\n\n3.8 Hz\n\n2.9 Hz\n3.8 Hz\n\n2.7 Hz\n\n100E-9\n\n100E-9\n\n10E-9\n\n10E-9\n\n1E-9\n0.2\n\n1\n\n1.8\n\n2.6\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n3.4\n\n4.2\n\nFigure 5.

The frequencies listed\nwere based on visual comparisons with the numerical deflection shapes. For the OMA analysis, the mode at\n2.0 Hz required a reference in the middle of an SRB and high model order in order to identify it. The highest\nconfidence is in the frequencies estimated by both the ODS analysis for individual data sets and OMA for the\ncombined data sets, which are highlighted in bold print. These are predominantly modes with significant SRB\nparticipation, as illustrated by the modes shown in Figures 7and 8. The system modes were difficult to\nidentify from the ambient response data sets. It is important to note that two system modes were measured\nat 2.7 and 2.9 Hz that are not present in the results for the numerical model. The mode shapes for these\nfrequencies are shown in Figures 9 and 10. The response of the system indicates relative motion across the\nCT hydraulic jacking, equalizing and leveling (JEL) system (see Figure 2, points 30-33 at top versus 34-37 at\nbase of JEL system). These modes were not consistently excited/identified in all of the ambient data sets.\nHowever, the mode at 2.7 Hz may be critical since it is at the third harmonic of the forcing frequency for the\n0.9 MPH CT speed. A comparison of Figures 4 and 9 indicates that the operating deflection shape at 2.7 Hz\ncontains similar MLP pitch and SRB bending motions as the mode estimated at 2.7 Hz. However, the forced\nresponse shown in Figure 4 contains a significant amount of MLP yaw motion that is not observed in the 2.7\nHz mode shown in Figure 9. There is a 2.58 Hz yaw mode predicted by the numerical model which may be\ncontributing to the forced response.\n\nDescription\n\nTable 3.

Therefore, ODS analyses concentrated on the ambient wind, CT idle, data\nsets.\nThere is good agreement between the measured and predicted natural frequencies for the SRB\nbending modes. System modes of the overall CT, MLP, SRB assembly were more difficult to define. The\noverall system is a massive structure that is difficult to excite with ambient excitations associated with the\nwind and idling CT engines. Two system modes involving relative motion of the CT JEL system were\nmeasured at 2.7 and 2.9 Hz that are not present in the results for the numerical model. These modes were\nnot consistently excited/identified in all of the ambient data sets. However, the mode at 2.7 Hz may be critical\nsince it is at the third harmonic of the forcing frequency for the 0.9 MPH CT speed. Further investigation is\nrequired to define the system level modes with confidence.\nREFERENCES:\n[1]\nKSC Transporters, http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/nasafact/historical/transportersold.htm,\nKSC Release No. FS-2000-04-28-KSC, Revised April 2000\n[2]\n\nElliott, K.
