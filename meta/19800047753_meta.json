Values of Al-26/Al-27 of about 0.5-1, with Al-27/Al-27(solar) of about 1-2, are predicted in some cases. It is pointed out that such results can lead to isotope shifts in the absorption lines of AlH and AlO, which should be observationally identifiable in some late-type supergiants. The possible connection with the anomalous Mg-26 content (assigned to the decay of Al-26) detected in some meteorites and the connection with formation of the solar system are also touched on.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800047753, "id": "9a84990845b942b3a8745040fbf78607", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal", "publicationDate": "1980-03-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
