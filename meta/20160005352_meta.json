(PSI), and Orbital Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC) are developing a unique chemical propulsion system for next-generation NASA science spacecraft and missions. The system is compact, lightweight, and can operate with high reliability over extended periods of time and under a wide range of thermal environments. The system uses a new storable, low-toxicity liquid monopropellant as its working fluid. In Phase I, the team demonstrated experimentally the critical ignition and combustion processes for the propellant and used the data to develop thruster design concepts. In Phase II, the team developed and demonstrated in the laboratory a proof-of-concept prototype thruster. A Phase III project is envisioned to develop a full-scale protoflight propulsion system applicable to a class of NASA missions.", "title": "Green Liquid Monopropellant Thruster", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2016-04-26T15:40:50.3130000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20160005352, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Joshi, Prakash B."}, "organization": {"name": "Physical Sciences, Inc.", "location": "Andover, MA, United States"}}, "id": "8c7dd34e9873423388ccc82bd349a73c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20160005352, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160005352, "id": "a78e6ffb2a0f4976ac50df26d34b3947", "publicationName": "An Overview of SBIR Phase 2 In-Space Propulsion and Cryogenic Fluids Management", "publicationDate": "2015-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20150015569, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "An Overview of SBIR Phase 2 In-Space Propulsion and Cryogenic Fluids Management", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160005352.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160005352/downloads/20160005352.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160005352/downloads/20160005352.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160005352/downloads/20160005352.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
