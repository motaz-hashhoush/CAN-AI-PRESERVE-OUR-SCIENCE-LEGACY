In\norder for a fuel alternate to be truly effective, it must have a\nsustainable supply and cause little environmental harm. Combustor emissions are of great relevance in alternate fuel\nconsiderations for both combustor efficiency as well as environmental and human health. The life cycle analysis (LCA) of\nfuel feedstocks carries a great effect on the usability of the fuel\nin aviation and is directly related to the combustor emissions\ndata. The LCA estimates the impact of the greenhouse gas\nemissions for the entire fuel process, from production to distribution to usage, and can determine the true efficacy of using\nalternate fuel blends (Ref. 1). The testing discussed in this\nstudy represents only the emissions created when the fuel is in\nuse. Because alternative fuels from multiple feedstocks are still\nbeing explored, fuel-flexible engine combustors are the primary\ntargets for these tests, as they will be used for most of the fueling with alternate fuels in the near future.\nThe emissions trending described in this paper proves some\nexpected trends while highlighting differences for further\nobservation. Data were taken from \xe2\x80\x9cCombustor A,\xe2\x80\x9d a proprietary-geometry three-cup combustor sector representative of\ncurrent engine combustor technology (details withheld because of proprietary concerns). Both the gaseous and particulate sampling probes were placed at the nozzle exit plane. The\nprobes were specially built for the cell facility at WrightPatterson Air Force Base. The facility has two identical fueling\nsystems in place: one for the JP\xe2\x80\x938+100 (herein referred to as\n\xe2\x80\x9cJP\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x9d) fueling purposes and one for the Fischer-Tropsch (FT)\nfuel. The fuel is blended on line to achieve the desired blend.\nFurther details regarding the facility, errors, postprocessing\n\nSummary\nIn order to meet rapidly growing demand for fuel, as well\nas address environmental concerns, the aviation industry has\nbeen testing alternate fuels for performance and technical\nusability in commercial and military aircraft. In order to make\nalternate fuels (and blends) a viable option for aviation, the\nfuel must be able to perform at a similar or higher level than\ntraditional petroleum fuel. They also attempt to curb harmful\nemissions, and therefore a truly effective alternate fuel would\nemit at or under the level of currently used fuel. This report\nanalyzes data from gaseous and particulate emissions of an\naircraft combustor sector. The data were evaluated at various\ninlet conditions, including variation in pressure and temperature, fuel:air ratios, and percent composition of alternate fuel.\nTraditional JP\xe2\x80\x938+100 data were taken as a baseline, and\nblends of JP\xe2\x80\x938+100 with synthetic-paraffinic-kerosene (SPK)\nfuel (Fischer-Tropsch (FT)) were used for comparison. Gaseous and particulate emissions, as well as flame luminosity,\nwere assessed for differences between FT composition of 0, 50,\nand 100 percent. The data show that SPK fuel (an FT-derived\nfuel) had slightly lower harmful gaseous emissions, and smoke\nnumber information corroborated the hypothesis that SPK\xe2\x80\x93FT\nfuels are cleaner burning fuels.\n\nIntroduction\nCurrently, alternate aviation fuels must satisfy MIL\xe2\x80\x93DTL\xe2\x80\x93\n83133F(2008) (military) or ASTM D 7566\xe2\x80\x93Annex(2011)\n(commercial) standards and are termed \xe2\x80\x9cdrop-in\xe2\x80\x9d fuel\nreplacements. Fuel blends of up to 50 percent alternative fuel\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217734\n\n1\n\nparameters, and so forth, are available in Reference 2. This\nreport provides a full analysis of the data set introduced in\nthat paper.\nGenerally, the FT fuel is expected to be a cleaner burning\nfuel than the JP\xe2\x80\x938 fuel, and the blend falls somewhere\nbetween the two. The blend data appear to lean closer to the\nJP\xe2\x80\x938 emissions count rather than the FT emissions, allowing\nus to conclude that JP\xe2\x80\x938 is the dominating fuel in the blend,\nwhich is of potential importance when determining carbon\ncredits or other emissions implications. This is corroborated\nby observations in performance data sets for these tests.\n\nCombustor Parameters and Collection\nof Data\nData from Combustor A emissions were assessed for the\nfollowing variables:\n(1) Inlet pressure (P) and temperature (T): 75 psia (0.52 MPa)\nand 500 \xef\x82\xb0F (533 K), 125 psia (0.86 MPa) and 625 \xef\x82\xb0F\n(603 K), 175 psia (1.21 MPa) and 725 \xef\x82\xb0F (658 K), and\n225 psia (1.55 MPa) and 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K)\n(2) Combustor pressure drop (\xce\x94P): 3, 4, and 5 percent\n(3) Fuel blends: 100 percent JP\xe2\x80\x938, 50:50 JP\xe2\x80\x938:FT, and\n100 percent FT (\xc2\xb15 percent)\n(4) Fuel:air ratio (F/A): 0.010, 0.015, 0.020, and 0.025\n\n(3) NOx emissions: Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions (ppm)\nwere taken as a combination of NO (ppm) and NO2 (ppm)\ndata. Because NO emissions were greater, the NO trends are\ndominant in the NOx emissions data. Therefore, the emissions show a monotone decrease as %\xce\x94P increases, and a\nmonotone increase with F/A (Fig. 1), similar to the NO emissions. NOx emissions also increase with absolute pressure.\nEmissions from the 100-percent FT blend do tend to be lower\nthan those of the JP\xe2\x80\x938 fuel, but the difference is too small to\nbe conclusive.\n(4) CO2 emissions: The percent of carbon dioxide (CO2)\nemissions (0.116 nm) did not show a significant difference\nbetween fuels or %\xce\x94P, and maintained a monotone increase\nwith F/A.\n(5) CO emissions: Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (ppm)\n(0.113 nm) showed significant increases with F/A. In the\n75-psia (0.52-MPa) pressure combustor, the only pressure for\nwhich the F/A data go up to 0.025, the CO concentration\ndoubled from F/A of 0.020 to 0.025 (Fig. 2).\nThe FT and 50:50 fuels showed a more pronounced jump\nwith the increasing F/A (0.020 to 0.025) than the JP\xe2\x80\x938. CO\nemissions also showed a drastic decrease as absolute pressure\nincreased.\nFigure 3 shows overall trends in CO emissions differences\nbetween the JP\xe2\x80\x938, the 50:50 blend, and FT fuels. A greater\ndifference is apparent at higher F/A values. The 100-percent\nFT and 50:50 fuels generally emit less to similar amounts\nthan JP\xe2\x80\x938 over the range of (\xce\x94P) yet at higher F/A and lower\ninlet pressures (P), emit higher amounts with increasing (\xce\x94P).\nThe differences in CO become less significant at higher P and\nlower F/A.\n\nData were collected for the following emissions: NO (ppm),\nNO2 (ppm), NOx (ppm), CO (ppm), CO2 (percent), O2 (percent), and total hydrocarbon (THC) (ppm). Photodiode output\nvoltage was also taken, and both still and high-speed photography were used and can be correlated with this luminosity data.\nData such as smoke number information and particulate\nemissions are analyzed, in part, because of an incomplete data\nset. Data from collaborative testing sites are summarized in\nrelevance to the paper to illustrate uniformity of the results.\n\nGaseous Emissions\nEmissions such as nitrogen and carbon oxides are\nimportant to military and civil aviation. The emissions data\ncollected in this study are listed below.\n(1) NO emissions: Nitric oxide (NO) emissions (with molecular atomic dimension 0.115 nm), measured in ppm, show\nuniform results for all pressure levels. There is a monotone\ndecrease as the change in percentage combustor pressure drop\n(%\xce\x94P) increases and a monotone increase as F/A increases.\n(2) NO2 emissions: Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions,\nmeasured in ppm, (0.221 nm) follow a monotone increase\nwith F/A. There is little change as %\xce\x94P increases. The FT fuel\ntrends show greater NO2 emissions than the JP\xe2\x80\x938 fuel. Unlike\nother emissions data, the 50:50 blend trends towards the FT\nfuel data rather than the JP\xe2\x80\x938 data.\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217734\n\n2\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217734\n\n3\n\nTABLE I.\xe2\x80\x94COMBUSTOR EFFICIENCY DATA SUMMARY AT 75 psia (0.52 MPa)\nCombustor pressure drop,\n\xce\x94P\n3 percent\n4 percent\n5 percent\nFuel:air ratio,\nFuel:air ratio,\nFuel:air ratio,\nF/A\nF/A\nF/A\n0.010 to 0.020 0.025 0.010 to 0.020 0.025 0.010 to 0.020 0.025\nFuels\nJP\xe2\x80\x938\n50:50 blend\nFischer-Tropsch (FT)\nAverage efficiency, percent\nStandard deviation\n\n99.61\n99.65\n99.66\n99.64\n0.024\n\n99.32\n99.24\n99.20\n99.25\n0.058\n\n99.10\n99.09\n98.96\n99.05\n0.080\n\n99.46\n99.46\n99.48\n99.47\n0.013\n\n99.20\n98.90\n98.87\n98.99\n0.181\n\nslightly lower than the rest (Table I). At 3 percent \xce\x94P, the\nefficiency of all fuel blends averages to 99.64 percent with a\nstandard deviation of 0.024 for F/A of 0.010, 0.015, and 0.020.\nHowever, at 0.025, the average efficiency is 99.25 percent with\na standard deviation of 0.058. Similar trends are shown at\n4 percent \xce\x94P, with averages and standard deviations of 99.56\nand 0.011 along with 99.05 and 0.080, respectively, as well as\n5 percent \xef\x81\x84P with averages and standard deviations of 99.47\nand 0.013 along with 98.99 and 0.181, respectively.\nThe efficiency difference between the first three F/A values\nand the fourth is much more significant than between the\nvarious types of fuel, as shown by the standard deviation. The\ndata at 5 percent \xce\x94P and F/A = 0.025 ratio is the one exception, as the difference between fuel blends is definite. The\nefficiency difference between fuel blends is more pronounced\nat higher %\xce\x94P and F/A. The combustor efficiency for all\nthree blends decreases as \xce\x94P increases, but for all F/A values\nbefore 0.025, the efficiency differences between the blends\nare insignificant.\n\n(6) O2 emissions: The percent of oxygen (O2) emissions\n(0.116 nm) did not show a significant difference between\nfuels or %\xce\x94P, and maintained a monotone increase with F/A.\n(7) THC emissions: Total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions\ndo not show trends directly related to F/A, fuel type, or %\xce\x94P\nfor F/A <0.025. For the 75 psia (0.52 MPa) pressure data, there\nis again a significant increase in THC concentration, particularly for FT and 50:50 fuels relative to JP\xe2\x80\x938, from F/A of 0.020 to\n0.025 (Fig. 4). The smoke number data are not available for this\nF/A of 0.025.\nIt is possible that a F/A of 0.025 represents the combustor\nefficiency drop-off ratio as the amount of uncombusted fuel\nrises significantly because of the fuel itself or combustor\nconfiguration (e.g., poor atomization, F/A, reactant-product\nmixing, or decreased heat content), contributing to higher\nemissions as shown in CO and THC data (Figs. 2 and 4).\nThe data taken at the combustors show that in the 75 psia\n(0.52 MPa) data, the combustor efficiency at F/A = 0.025 is\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217734\n\n99.56\n99.56\n99.58\n99.56\n0.011\n\n4\n\nwith increasing %\xce\x94P and %FT composition (Fig. 6). The\ndecreased luminosity of the 50:50 blend and the FT fuel show\nthat they are cleaner burning fuels than JP\xe2\x80\x938 (Fig. 7). The\nluminosity indicates carbon presence in the flames, and therefore the potential for carbon deposits within or coming\nthrough the engine to be released into the environment. The\ndecrease in luminosity as the fuel blend approaches full FT\nfuel implies that the radiative heat loss is also decreasing as\nwould liner temperature. This decrease occurs across increasing %\xce\x94P and decreased F/A as well, signifying lower heat\nlosses, cleaner burning, and a higher exit temperature from\nthe combustor of the engine.\n\nSmoke and Photodiode Numbers\nThe smoke number measurements were taken by filtering an\nexhaust sample and comparing the change in reflectance. The\nsmoke data and the THC emissions (ppm) are expected to be\nsomewhat correlated. The smoke number data from this testing\nrun are partially incomplete, but the data obtained show some\ndefinite trends. Smoke number decreases as 100 percent FT\nfueling is approached, with more distinct decreases at higher F/A.\nFigure 5 illustrates this with the available smoke number data.\nThe change in flame photodiode luminosity is related to all\nvariables tested. It increases with F/A and decreases steadily\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217734\n\n5\n\nmake definite conclusions, the effects of particulates will be\nleft for another report. A figure of particulate sample size\ndistributions has been included (Fig. 9) to illustrate again the\nsignificant difference between pure FT fuel and the blend and\nJP\xe2\x80\x938. The total number of particulates is visibly smaller, as is\nthe peak size of the particles. This indicates the need for further studies into the size-related particle health effects. There\nare many analyses underway to characterize and compare\nparticulate emissions for alternate fuels (e.g., alternative fuels\ntesting on a C\xe2\x80\x9317 aircraft (Ref. 4)).\n\nParticulate Emissions\nThe particulate emissions of any fuel are of utmost concern\nfor both environmental and human health (Ref. 3). Like the\ngaseous emissions, they relate to engine temperature and\npressure, %\xce\x94P, F/A, and fuel composition. The data available\nfrom this study do demonstrate the clear reduction in particulate emissions from FT fuel at all pressures and F/A values\n(Fig. 8). Because the particulate emission size-distribution\ndata available from this particular study was not enough to\n\nNASA/TP\xe2\x80\x942013-217734\n\n6\n\nThe effect of these particulate emissions on human health\nhas been concluded by a number of researchers (Ref. 5), and\nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has launched a\nprogram involving multiple research centers to further investigate the hazards. The hazards include distress in respiratory\nand cardiovascular function\xe2\x80\x94contributing to the development\nor worsening of common distresses such as asthma, chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disorder, angina pectoris, myocardial\ninfarction (heart attack), and more. The possibility and problems associated with particles moving into the blood stream\nand being transported to other vital organs is also being considered (Ref. 6).\n\ncompetitiveness, it is necessary for countries to move towards\nalternate fuels such as those proposed in this report.\n\nConcluding Remarks\nGathering preliminary data is essential for establishing\nbaseline information to compare performance and emissions\ndata for alternate-fuel-flexible combustor-sector systems.\nObserving pure synthetic-paraffinic-kerosene (SPK) fuel\n(Fischer-Tropsch (FT)) and blended fuel with respect to\nJP\xe2\x80\x938+100 fuels can lead to the future development of new,\nefficient, and effective combustor systems for these up-andcoming types of fuel. Fuel-flexible systems are the near-term\ngoal for the industry, and analysis of combustor performance\nis necessary for utilization of alternative fuels. The data from\nCombustor A summarized in this report provide analysis and\ncomparison based on a variety of engine variables.\nInlet temperature and pressure, fuel-to-air ratio (F/A), combustor pressure drops, and fuel blends were the parameters\nvaried for this study.\nGenerally, the gaseous emissions varied more based on F/A\nthan the fuel blend used. This report indicates that both\n100 percent FT and the 50:50 blend emit at or under currently\nacceptable rates. Although the differences were not enormous, FT fuel did have generally lower NOx emissions, one\nof the primary regulated emissions species today. However, at\nhigher F/A, the combustor efficiency drops and emissions\nincrease more with FT fuel blends than with JP\xe2\x80\x938.\nThe smoke number differences were very distinct and point\nto the fact that, as hoped, SPK fuels are cleaner burning than\nJP\xe2\x80\x938 fuels, and the 50:50 blend is an intermediate step towards\nenvironmentally friendly fuel. It is important to note that a\n50:50 blend does not directly correlate to a 50 percent reduction in smoke or emissions, which has implications towards the\neffectiveness of using a blend as an economic substitute.\nMultiple studies and data sets show that SPK fuel and fuel\nblends do not have a significant negative impact on the performance of combustor sector systems, and that emissions\nproduced certainly do not exceed the current limitations on\ntraditional fuel. Taking into account the life cycle analysis\nand emissions reduction for alternate fueling, these SPK fuels\nare a promising near-term alternative for jet fuels.\n\nEngine Emissions Testing\nFurther testing that provides other insight into particulate\nemissions for both small and large engines has been done in\ncollaboration with a large group of organizations, including\ngovernment agencies, private industries, and educational\ninstitutions.\nTesting run by General Electric (GE) showed that for alternate fuels, the emissions level of the regulated emissions\n(NOx, CO, hydrocarbons, and smoke number) were within\nthe limits set for traditional fuels. The GE study observed\npower levels starting from idle through to takeoff, capturing a\nfull performance that the data in this report does not span.\nThis study corroborates our results, presenting alternative fuel\nemissions and indicating that similar trends occur all through\nthe flying process, offering further insight for true LCA\n(Ref. 7).\nA small-engine test with similar fuel parameters to ours\nwas conducted with a Pratt & Whitney small turbine engine,\nwith 100 percent FT fuel and JP\xe2\x80\x938 as well as a 50:50 blend.\nThe trends observed in this test were similar: small reductions\nin NOx emissions as the SPK\xe2\x80\x93FT fuel percentage increased,\nespecially at higher power. The smoke number data was more\nconclusive, with the FT fuels having significantly lower\nsmoke measurements than the JP\xe2\x80\x938 fuel (Ref. 8).\nLarger engine tests, such as those conducted in the Alternate Aviation Fuel Experiment (AAFEX) study (Refs. 9 and\n10), point in the same direction with regards to emissions\ntrends. The C\xe2\x80\x9317 test also tested both gaseous and particulate\nemissions data with similar results (Ref. 4).\n\nGlenn Research Center\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nCleveland, Ohio, September 23, 2013\n\nEmissions Implications\nThe European Union has recently moved to implement a\ncarbon emissions tax on airlines flying in and out of its airspace, an act that has enraged officials in foreign countries\nsuch as the United States and China.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES\n\n14. ABSTRACT\n\nIn order to meet rapidly growing demand for fuel, as well as address environmental concerns, the aviation industry has been testing alternate\nfuels for performance and technical usability in commercial and military aircraft. In order to make alternate fuels (and blends) a viable\noption for aviation, the fuel must be able to perform at a similar or higher level than traditional petroleum fuel. They also attempt to curb\nharmful emissions, and therefore a truly effective alternate fuel would emit at or under the level of currently used fuel. This report analyzes\ndata from gaseous and particulate emissions of an aircraft combustor sector. The data were evaluated at various inlet conditions, including\nvariation in pressure and temperature, fuel-to-air ratios, and percent composition of alternate fuel. Traditional JP-8+100 data were taken as a\nbaseline, and blends of JP-8+100 with synthetic-paraffinic-kerosene (SPK) fuel (Fischer-Tropsch (FT)) were used for comparison. Gaseous\nand particulate emissions, as well as flame luminosity, were assessed for differences between FT composition of 0, 50, and 100 percent. The\ndata show that SPK fuel (an FT-derived fuel) had slightly lower harmful gaseous emissions, and smoke number information corroborated\nthe hypothesis that SPK-FT fuels are cleaner burning fuels.\n15.
