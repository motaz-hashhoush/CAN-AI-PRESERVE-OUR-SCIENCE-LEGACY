This study of two parallel jets is unique since most previous aerodynamic structure experiments were limited to single round and two-dimensional jets. The present closely spaced dual jet geometry was motivated by the potential jet noise reduction available from this configuration. This geometry has shown promise as a method for redirecting jet noise away from ground based observers in side by side or over/under turbofan engine mountings on aircraft (Simonich et al., 1984). Since the effectiveness of this noise reduction technique is based on the existence of two independent jets, an understanding of the aerodynamics of the merging process is essential to establishing the acoustic benefits. The experimental program was structured so that Mach number, jet exit temperature, and spacing to diameter ratios could be independently varied to isolate each effect.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860035052, "id": "a56c777c811c4daaac93843423826530", "publicationDate": "1986-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
