You\'ve\ndefined the edge.\nThe mM 3090 with Vector Facility, for its part, has redefined supercomputer\nperformance, combining up to six vector processors with one of the industry\'s fastest\nscalar processors and most efficient memory management systems, parallel processing\ncapabilities, and full mM System 1370 compatibility.\nThe result is balanced supercomputer performance that can improve your job\nturnaround by eliminating data bottlenecks, and save the added expense of a separate\n\nfront-end processor. Plus, the mM Vector Facility\'s modular design lets you start with just\nthe computer power you need today, and make economical in-field upgrades as your\nneeds grow. And that gives the mM 3090VF a big edge over more expensive and less\nflexible vector processors.\nmM\'s integrated system approach combines the power of the mM 3090VF with the\nadvantages of a single operating environment, low entry cost, low software and\nmaintenance costs, a wide variety of application programs, and mM support to create a\nwinner in total cost-of-computing.\nTo find out more, or to arrange to have your mM Marketing Representative contact\nyou, simply call1-800-mM-2468, ext. 20. ~~\n\n== ==.\n- - - --- - --~-\n\n-~-\n\n<0 IBM 1989\n\n,\n\n-\n\nTech Briefs\nTransferri ng Technology to\nAmerican Industry and Government\nJUNE 1989\nVolume 13 Number 6\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\nSpace-Age Vision Aids.\n\n.. 16\n\nMission Accomplished\n\n.117\n\nTECHNICAL SECTION\n~~ New Product Ideas\n\n.12\n\n<i> NASA TU Services\n\n.14\n\n~ Electronic Components\n\n_\n\nand Circuits ..... .\n\ni\n\n~\n\n.22\n\nElectronic Systems ...... . . 34\nPhysical Sciences ....... . .48\nMaterials ........ .\n\n.64\n\nComputer Programs\n\n.68\n.72\n.82\n.86\n\nMechanics\nMachinery .\ni i Fabrication Technology\n\ntJ Information Sciences\nMathematics and\n,-:;\n\nDEPARTMENTS\nOn The Cover: Using\npowerful supercomputers,\nNASA scientists have\nsimulated the complex flow\nof blood In an artificial\nheart.

Indeed, in\nthe world of waveform aquisition and\nanalysis , where more is better, the\nSystem 500 is in a class by itself. The\n500 has more channels, more memory,\nmore speed and more resolution.\nEach digitizer board, with its own\nindependent trigger circuitry, time\nbase and up to 1 mega sample record\nlength, is worthy of a full review. This\nmulti-channel system can be\nconfigured to have as many inputs you\nneed - up to several hundred . The\ndigitizer boards are designed to be the\nequivalent of having a 12 bit digital\nscope on a card.\n\nTurn-key system\nBut after you get your hands on the\nSystem 500, the the most important\nnews becomes apparent. Someone has\nfinally developed a very powerful,\ncompetitively priced system for\nwaveform aquisition and analysis that\ntruly is a "turn-key" system.\nYou literally can take this system\nout of the box, plug in the power cord,\nconnect the GPIB cable between the\naquisition unit and the controller, and\nturn it on. The System 500 is now\nready to take data. This turn-key\nreadiness promises to save time by\nconsiderably reducing the learning\ncurve needed to perform complex\nwaveform aquisition and analysis.\n\nimmediately displayed on the screen.\nBy using the Delta Numerics function\nrelative measurements like peak to\npeak or rise time can easily be made.\nAlso , Nicolet\'s unique software ,\ncombined with the System 500\'s\nbuilt-in processor and co-processor,\nmake incredibly fast waveform\nprocessing and analysis possible.\n\nLocal processing\nWhile other data aquisition systems\nneed to transfer data to another\ncomputer for analysis, Nicolet has\nbuilt calculation capabilities into the\nnew System 500. Complex calculations\ncan be performed on acquired data as\nit resides in the digitizer\'s memory.\nThere is no need to transfer data to\na computer for analysis, no need for\ncomplex programming to handle\nnormalizing sets and long record\nlengths. Functions are performed on\nthe powerful 32 bit processors with a\nfew clicks of the mouse. This local\nprocessing of data greatly decreases\nthe time it takes to generate answers.\nThe bottom line is that the System\n500 is a unique turn-key waveform\nacquisition system. For full details\nyoul1 need to read the product\nbrochure.\n\nCall Nicolet Test Instruments\n(800) 356\xc2\xb73090\n\nIntuitive windows software\nThe primary reason for System\n500\'s easy operation is Nicolet\'s\nunique software which operates under\nMicrosoft Windowsl386\xc2\xae The powerful\n.\nNicolet software can easily be\ncontrolled through pulldown menus\nthat can be accessed by mouse or\nkeyboard.\nMeasuring waveforms becomes as\nsimple as pointing to the data point of\ninterest on a waveform and clicking\nthe mouse - the voltage and time\nvalues for the selected point is\n18\n\nThe new Nicolet System 500 offers\nmulti-channel flexibility with up to 10\nMegaSamples/Second digitizing rates.\n\nAd" errisement\n\nCircle Reader Actio n No. 696\n\nportion of the glasses. Lenses and\nglass fibers will be embedded on each\nside of the wraparound section, where\nthe front and ear pieces join. The\nlenses will transport images along the\nfibers to a miniature solid-state camera carried in a belt or shoulder pack.\nImages will be processed by a batterypowered computer in the pack and\nthen transported via fiber back to the\ndisplay screens for viewing.\nThevision system may incorporate\na programmable remap per developed\nat the Johnson Center to perform realtime spatial remapping between input\nand output video. The Remapper\nwould " wrap" images around the\npatient\'s blind spot, warping the image so that it is pulled, like a rubber\nsheet, away from the blind area and\nmagnified.\nNASA expects a lightweight prototype to be ready in about five years,\nwith clinical testing to follow soon\nafter. The first head-mounted model\nmay be similarto an imaging system\ninvented by Ames scientists for\nhuman factors research (NTB\nVol. 12, Num. 7). This "Virtual Workstation" combines three-dimensional\ngraphics, wide field-of-view optics,\nand advanced eye-tracking techniques to create astereoscopic experience that gives the user a sense of\nbeing inside the display.\n\nA Dynamic Vision Aid\nThe Low Vision Enhancement System should benefit patients with\ncentral vision loss, the part of vision\nnormally used for reading. These\npatients may have maculardegeneration associated with aging, ordiabetic\nretinopathy, in which diabetes causes\nswelling and leakage of fluid in the\ncenter of the retina. It also could help\npatients with impaired side vision due\nto eye diseases such as retinitis\npigmentosa.\n"This system won\'t restore lost vision," said Dr. Robert Massof, Director of Wilmer\'s Vision Research and\nRehabilitation Center. "Rather, it will\nhelp patients make the best use of\ntheir remaining vision."\nOngoing Wilmer research supported by the National Eye Institute will\nprovide information on how images\nmust be changed and enhanced for\nthe low-vision sufferer. "The effect of\nvisual impairment on reading, face\nand object recognition, orientation,\nand mobility are important research\nareas that will guide us in developing\nthe Low Vision Enhancement System," said Dr. Gary Rubin, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at\nWilmer.\n\nThe First Step\nNASA first will assemble a basic\nresearch system for Wilmer that will\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\nSometimes overnight is\nabsolutely, positively too late.\nWe\'re not knocking the other guys, but sometimes you need to get it there right away The very\nsame day Today, not tomorrow.\nWith TWf:\\s Next Flight Out\xc2\xb7 delivery service,\nyou\'re in business.\nEven as you read this, TWA planes are about to\ntake off.

Expected on\nthe market by 1991 , the system\nchanges the spatial contrast of\nprinted material to compensate for\nmaculopathies, or central vision\nlosses. Maculopathy patients,\nmostly elderly, can no longer see\nfine detail or read due to the breakdown of key cells in the retina.\n" Until now ," said Dr. Teri\nLawton , the system \'s inventor,\n" there\'s been virtually nothing to\nhelp people with central vision\nproblems." Because maculopathy\nis a degeneration of nerve cells\nrather than a problem of the lens\nor other parts of the eye, it does not\nrespond to conventional treatment\nor corrective lenses. Powerful magnifiers, which spread a few fuzzy\nletters over the entire visual field ,\nprovide minimal relief.\nLike the Low Vision Enhancement System, Lawton \'s invention\nis based on digital image processing technology. She uses acomputer workstation to test the patient\'s\nvisual acuity and then , with\ncustomized image processing\nsoftware , to enlarge and filter\nprinted words on a closed-circuit\ntelevision screen so they have the\nright amount of brightness for the\npatient to read clearly.\nIn recent experiments using the\nscreening method, patient reading\nspeeds increased from two to four\ntimes-with up to 70 percent less\nmagnification needed for word\nrecognition-compared to reading\nunfiltered text.\n" The next step, " Lawton said,\n"is to incorporate this technology\nin a desktop system, something\nlike a microfilm or microfiche\nreader. I\'d like to get some of these\n\ninclude a general-purpose computer\nfor real-time image processing. The\ncomputer will be connected to image processing workstations with\nmultiple input and output devices,\nenabling Wilmer researchers to simultaneously perform a variety of\nexperiments.\n" The idea is to first get a working\nimage processing system going and\nthen to add on new and better pieces\nof technology as they evolve," explained Dr. Douglas Rickman, who is\n20\n\nout to low-vision clinics forevaluation." Books and magazines would\nbe inserted and moved past the TV\ncamera\'s lens for reading .\nJPL is collaborating with Visualtek, Inc., a leading manufacturerof\nreading aids based on closedcircuit TV technology, to produce\nan inexpensive commercial model\nthat should be available within two\nyears.\n" Our ultimate goal," Lawton\nsaid, " is to develop a portable\nreading machine in the form of\neyeglasses. We \' ll need liquid\n\nheading the low vision project at\nStennis. "We\'ll use feedback from the\nexperimentors to make hardware\nmodifications and to design the finished software. "\nThe software environment will be\nhighly flexible, according to Rickman.\n" In the past," he said, " vision scientists had to build specialized hardware tools to perform experiments.\nWe want to give them a general ized\nsoftware tool that will allow them to\ncreate, edit, and manipulate images in\n\nDr. Lawton\'s filtered Images appear\nslightly blurred to the ordinary ob\xc2\xb7\nserver, but are more easily readable\nby the person for whom the enhance\xc2\xb7\nment formula was made.\n\ncrystal displays with higher contrast than what\'s available today,\nso we\'re probably looking five or\nten years down the road." 0\nDr. Teri Lawton is a psychologist and\nmathematician researching fundamental vision functions in JPL \'s Robotics,\nTeleoperators, and Human Factors\nResearch Group.

At present, fluctuations in frequencyof 10 -16 represent the state of the\nart. The new design should enhance ultrastable measurements of time by reducing\nthe fluctuations to 2 x 10 -19 routinely, and\nto as little as 10 - 20 in exceptional cases.\nFluctuations in the amplitude of the oscillator signal caose fluctuations in the p0larization magnetic field in the ruby, which\nis the active element of the oscillator.\nBecause the magnetic field affects the frequency of oscillation, the amplitude fluctuations result in frequency fluctuations; in\nfact, the change in frequency is a known\nfunction of the change in amplitude. Heretofore, amplitude (and, therefore, frequency) fluctuations have been controlled by\nplacing a power detector and an electronically variable attenuator at room temperature in the pump-signal transmission line.\nHowever, this configuration is insensitive to\nchanges in amplitude that occur in the\ntransmission line beyond the power detector or in the ruby itself.\nIn the new system (see figure) currents\nare induced in a superconducting pickup\ncoil by changes in the magnetic field in the\nruby. The currents from the coil are fed to a\nsuperconducting quantum-interference\ndevice (SQUID) magnetometer, the output\nof which is used to generate the control\nsignal for the electronically variable attenuatm. Thus, the attenuator varies the pumpsignal amplitude in response to the magnetic-field fluctuations in the ruby. A very high\nfeedback-loop gain is used for sensitivity of\ncontrol and adequate compensation of\nfluctuations.\nThis work was done by Donald M.\nStrayer and G.

The packages\nprovide low-inductance connections, low\nloss, electrical isolation, and a long-life hermetic seal. The design of the packages\nsolves the historical problem of separation\nof the electrical interface from the thermal\ninterface of a high-power semiconductor\ndevice.\nThe low inductance is achieved by making all electrical connections to each\npackage on the same plane (see figure).\nThis also reduces high-frequency losses by\nreducing coupling into the inherent shorted\nturns in the packaging material around the\nconductor axes. Stranded intemal power\nconductors aid conduction at high frequencies, where the skin effect predominates. Other conductors are large and\nmade of oxygen\xc2\xb7free, high-conductivity\ncopper for low electrical resistance. All\nconductors are made as short and thick as\npossible to minimize inductance. The insulators have high dielectric strength and a\nlow dissipation factor.\nThe semiconductor device is e!ectricalIy isolated from the package by a beryllia\npad. The prime consideration in the design\nis the transfer of heat generated by the\ndevice to the heat sink, and beryllia was\nchosen because it provides the requisite\nelectrical insulation yet is sufficiently thermally conductive. This feature also reduces the capaCitance between the device and the heat sink, thereby reducing\nboth the radiation of electromagnetic interference and common-mode currents in\nthe heat sink.\nBoth semiconductor devices have glasspassivated junctions. All electrically active\ncomponents are isolated from the main\nbody of each package by insulation designed to withstand a potential of 2,500 V\nbetween the bottom plate of the package\nand the collector of the transistor or the\nanode of the diode. The hermetic seal of\nthe package retains an atmosphere of nitrogen. All of the interior surfaces are coated with an extra insulating layer of parylene. If the hermetic seal is broken, this\ncoat enables the device to passthrough the\nPaschen minimum-breakdown voltage\nWithout failure and protects the electrical\nparts from the environment.\nEach package fits within a rectangular\nparallelepiped of 1.445 by 2.250 by 1.640 in.\n(36.7 by 57.2 by 41.7 mm).

Selected areas of\ndifferent transistors can be enlarged bydifferent proportions that result in a specific\noverall increase or decrease in the susceptibility to single-event upsets.\nFor example, in the SRAM cell of Figure\n1, the rate of upsets can be increasAd by\n\nthe use of asymmetrically enlarged drain\nregions in pullup transistor 02 and pulldown transistor 05\' For a given level and\ntype of radiation, this design is estimated to\nincrease the rate by a factor of about 3\nover that of a symmetrical design.\nThe rates of upsets can be estimated by\na state-space-analysis technique based on\nthe use of a mathematical model of the\nmemory cell with drains of various sizes.\nThe technique is illustrated in Figure 2,\nwhere the horizontal and vertical axes represent the voltages on nodes b and a of\nFigure 1, respectively.

For example, if node a is initially held at a low voltage\nand is suddenly raised past the critical voltage by the impact of an energetic ion, then\nthe logic state of the cell will change from\n"zero" to "one".\'\nIn general, the critical deposited charge\nthat causes a given kind of upset depends\non these voltage-state-space relationships\nand the capacitances of the nodes. The\nsizes and asymmetry of the drains can be\nchosen not only to make the cell less sensitive (higher critical charge) but also to\nmake one-to-zero upsets more likely than\nzero-to-one upsets (or vice versa).\nThis work was done by Martin G.\nBuehler of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Pr0pulsion Laboratory.

The principle of operation is\nthe same, however. The photo-carriers\nproduced by the absorption of the modulating signal (photons of energy greater than\n\nthe 1.1-eV band gap of Si) in the PIN diode\nwould change the voltage on the MOW diode, and thus the field acting on the\nMOW\'s, controlling its transmission of the\nsignal to be modulated (photons of energy\nnear the MOW exciton level and less than\nthe Si band gap). As in the original modulator, the use of InAslGaAs allows the modulated light signal to pass freely through the\nsubstrate and offers the flexibility of tailor"\ning the quantum level of the MOW structure to adjust the wavelength of the modulated beam to values often used with fiber\noptics; e.g., 1.3 or 1.5,..m.\nThe confinement of misfit dislocations\ngenerated by the 4-percent mismatch beNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\ntween the ~ and Si lattices and the critical problem of control of the initial nucleation of ~ on Si is being solved in several\nlaboratories world-wide by using modulated-beam epitaxy and related vapor-phase\ndeposition techniques.\nThis \'NOrk was done by Joseph Maserjian\nand Sverre T.

They offer substantially higher specific energies (100 to\n125 watt\xc2\xb7hourslkilogram) and volumetric\nenergy densities (150 watt-hours/liter) than\naqueous systems. Uthium systems are still\nlargely experimental. Only one, the lithi\xc2\xb7\num/molybdenum disulfide (" Molicel") type,\nis being manufactured in a commercial pilot\nplant and is available only as samples for\nevaluation. The most promiSing development in lithium nonaqueous systems is the\nuse of polymer electrolytes instead of liquid\nelectrolytes. The solid polymer eliminates\nleakage and makes it possible to produce\nbatteries on a continuous assembly line\nwith a minimum of handling.\nMany advanced types of aqueous batteries are readily available.

The use of digital chip and phase\nadvancers provides outstanding control\nand accuracy in phase and feedback.\nGreat flexibility is imparted by the provision\nfor arbitrary starting time and integration\nlength. A minimum-bit design requires a\nminimum number of logical elements,\nthereby reducing the size, power, and cost.\nThe digital baseband processor in a\nGPS receiver (see Figure 1) consists of two\nmajor components: the tracking processor\nand the high-speed digital processor (see\nFigure 2). Control information sent by the\ntracking processor consists of the starting\ntime, the sum interval length, the initial\nphase and phase rate, and the initial delay\nand delay rate. Based on this input, the\nhigh-speed digital processor accepts input\ndata sampled at 1.5 to 2 MHz for the CIA\nchannel and 15 to 20 MHz for the P channel and counterrotates the carrier, crosscorrelates with the pseudorandom code,\nand accumulates the result over a nominal\n2(}ms interval.\nAll high-speed components are timed by\nthe P or CIA sampling clock. The resulting\ncorrelation sums are collected by the\ntracking processor and reduced to extract\nmeasured phase, delay, and data bits. The\ntracking processor analyzes these phase\nand delay values, averages them to obtain\nfeedback values to drive the digital equipment, and averages them over longer time\nintervals to reduce the output data rate.\nBecause all operations, including carrier downconversion, are digital, the phase\nand delay can be tracked and measured\nwith extremely small errors. Great flexibility\nin control is provided by the fact that this\ndesign requires user-supplied values for\nstarting time, integration length , phase,\nphase rate, delay, and delay rate. Mother\nflexible feature of this design is the sampling rate. The design itself does not restrict the rate range of the sampling clock.\n34\n\n.-------------------------------------------------------~\n\nBaseband\nSignal\n\nSample\nClock\n\n~\nSystem-\n\nnme\n\nAnaIog-to-Dlgltat\n\nConverter\n\n-- --\n\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -\n\n-\n\nHIGH\xc2\xb7SPEED DIGITAL\nPROCESSOR\n\nCarrier Downconverter,\nCorrel ator,\n20 ms Sum\n\nSOls\n\nChip\nnd Chip\nRate\n\n--\n\nPhase and\nPhase\nRate\n\n1---\n\nClock\n\nSOls\n\nStartlStop\nSOls\n\nContro l\nLogic\n\nComplex\nCorrelation\nSums\n\n50Is\n\n-- - -1 - - - - - - - - - --- r - -\n\nExtrapolate\nPhase and\nDelay\n\nStarting\nTime\n\nExtract Phase and\nDelay, Extract Data\nBit, and Average\nPhase and Delay\n\nTRACKING PROCESSOR\n\n-.\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nSum\nLength\n\nCompute\nSynchronized\nStarting\nTime\n\n-Phase, Delay, and\nData Bit\n0.001 to 1/s\n\nFigure 1. The Digital Baseband Processor in a GPS receiver recovers weak signals modulated by pseudorandom sequences.\n\nLimits on the sampling rate will be set by\nthe speed range of the specific equipment.\nEven though the basic design would apply to any number of levels per sample, the\nminimum-bit design has been illustrated in\nFigure 2. In this design, there is a voltage\nloss of 4 percent in the voltage signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) due to three-level quantization of the downconversion sinusoids\nand a 2O-percent loss if two-level sampling\nof the baseband signal is used. If threelevel sampling is used, there is a loss of approximately 10 percent. If these small losses are acceptable in a given application,\none can implement the minimum-bit de-\n\nsign and arrive at a digital logic with a minimum number of logical elements, thereby\ngreatly reducing the size, power consumption, and cost of the chip(s) fabricated to\ncarry out these operations.\nThe design can also be used for quadrature processing, even though Rgure 2 illustrates a single nonquadrature channel.\nTo process complex signals, the operations are applied separately to each quadrature channel in parallel equipment channels. Both quadrature channels can be\nserved by the same circuitry for generation\nof the delay code and counterrotation\nphasers.

The individualized\ncompensation filter that is marketed will be\nfiltering in the spatial domain for fast, inexpenSive image enhancement. The compensating filter includes a gain term that\ncontrols the compromise between enhancement of resolution and rejection of\nnoise. The fast Fourier transform is then inverted, and the contrast of the resulting\nprocessed image (see Figure 2) is adjusted\nto prevent clipping at the bright and dark\nextremes of the scene.\nAn afflicted observer could view the\nscene through a magnifier to shift the\nspatial frequencies downward and thereby\nimprove the perceived image. However,\nthe less the magnification needed, the\nlarger the scene that can be observed.\nThus, one measure of the effectiveness of\nthe new system is the amount of magnification required with and without it.

A pitch-axis bias switch lets the pilot\nselect one of nine settings for the zero reference of the display so that any of the following trajectories can be flown: 0 g, Y20 g,\nXo g, ~ g (Lunar gravity), Xg, ~ g, Xg (Martian gravity), ~ g, and %g.

The pitch and lateral displays are\nlocated in front of the pilot, who controls\nthe yoke and rudder. The thrust display is\nlocated in front of the copilot, who controls\nthe throttles.\nIn comparison with the usual needle displays, the LED bar-graph displays take up\nless panel space and are easier to align\nwith the axes they represent.

In a GPS\nreceiver, the initial chip value Onteger plus\nfractional parts) would be based on the\nstarting time and the feedback delay, while\nthe chip rate would be equal to the sum of\nthe rate of change of the delay and the fundamental chip rate divided by the sample\nrate. The chip advancer is activated and\ndeactivated by a "start" line. OIer a correlation interval, the model delay consists of\na linear time function.\nAs illustrated in the figure, the chip advancer is initialized by external hardware\nor software that supplies an initial fractional-chip value in the form of an integer equal\nto the fractional chip times 2N and a chip\nrate in the form of an integer equal to the\nchip rate (in chips per sample point) times\n2N, where N is the number of bits in the\nfractional-chip register. Simultaneously, the\nexternal device also initializes the registers\nof the code generator so that the code generator will produce the correct code sign\nfor the first sample point.\nWhen processing is started, the chip advancer is clocked by the sampling clock.\nFor each new sample point, the chip advancer adds the number in the rate register to the number in the fractional-chip register. When the fractional-chip register\noverflows, indicating a transition to a new\nchip, a pulse is generated. That pulse triggers enabling logic Circuitry that lets the\nconcurrent sampling clock advance the\ncode generator to the next chip. If the code\n40\n\ngenerator does not receive a new-chip-ac}\nvance signal for a given sample point, the\nprevious code sign persists for that sample.\nIf selected sampling rate is effectively\nincommensurate with the fundamental\nchip rate, the integrated error due to discrete sampling of the model code sequence can be reduced to negligible levels\nafter integration over a fairly short time. In\nselecting a sampling rate, it is advisable to\nchoose a value that is sufficiently removed\nfrom highly commensurate ratios (e.g., 211,\n3/2, etc.) so that the Doppler shift cannot\nchange the chip rate to a value highly commensurate with the sampling rate.\nAn important option in using the chip advancer is that the starting chip value, inclUC}\ning the fractional chip, can be set exactly\nevery sum interval. Thus, the measured\ndelay will be corrupted by roundoff errors\nat the level of 2 - N or less, which is less\nthan 100 nanochips for a 24-bit chip ac}\nvancer. The buildup of the roundoff error\ndue to roundoff in the rate register can be\neliminated by computing the roundoff accumUlation and offsetting the initial delay to\n\nCode Clock\n(A Clock Signal of\nUnequally Spaced Pulses)\n\nSampling\nClock\n\nEnabling\nLogic\n\nOverflow\nPulse\n\n1\nBinary\nPoint\n\ncompensate.

This approach allows the emphasis to be placed\non the development of software, which is a\ncritical element in parallel processing.\nAmong the software issues that RTMPS\ncan address are high-level programming\nlanguages, scheduling the transfer of data\nbetween computers, the partitioning of\nprograms, and support by an operatingsystem program.\nThe system can be based on a variety of\nmicrocomputer types. The characteristics\nof the hardware of each type are accounted for in a system executive program, a set\nof macroinstructions, and a target-computer-definition file. The system executive\nprogram performs such rudimentary functions as initialization, transfer of data, and\nhandling of interruptions. The system macroinstructions define basic mathematical\nand data-transfer operations for the target\nhardware. The target-definition file provides information in high-order language\nabout the microcomputer programming\nmodel. The system translates the highorder language into a time-efficient Assembler source program.\nTo retarget the system to a different microcomputer, changes are made only in\nthe system executive program, the macroinstructions, and the target-computer-definition file.

In effect, this\nmargin provides a bound on the magnitudes of perturbations, below which the perturbations will not make the system unstable.\nThe feedforward subsystem is assumed\ngiven, and the problem is to characterize a\nclass of feedback subsystems that pre-\n\nA paper presents a new approach to the\nanalysis of the stability of a multivariable\nfeedforward-and-feedback control system\nthat consists of an exponentially stable\nlinear time-invariant (LTI) feedforward subsystem and a nonlinear time-varying (NTV)\nor a dynamic feedback subsystem. Whereas older methods of analysis are based on\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\nserve the exponential stability of the system. By finding as large a stability region as\npossible under the nominal control, the\ncontroller can be tuned to enhance the robustness margin by effectively moving the\nnominal feedback system to a different\npoint.\nThe measures of robustness used in the\nsmall"9ain methods involve only the magnitude (but not the phase) information of the\nfeedforward subsystem. Based on experience in the design and analysis of classical\ncompensators, it is known that the phase\nof the nominal controlled system is frequently of cr~ical importance. Ignoring this\ninformation can sometimes lead to conservative design. The argument of passivity is motivated by this observation.\nThe characterization of robustness involves the Hermitian part of a transfer\nfunction, which contains both the gain and\nphase information. The importance of passivity lies in the concept of energy. The condition for the stability of the system can be\nstated as follows: If energy generated by\none block can be dissipated by the other\nblock, the system is stable. The amount of\nenergy generated or dissipated by a system is characterized by a quantity called\nthe v index, which is a measure of the minimum amount of parallel dissipation required\nto render a system passive. This energytransfer perspective is powerful because\nnonlinear systems can be considered within\n\nthe same context. Thus, h~herto inacinissible perturbations like saturation of actuators, coulomb friction, stlction, and\nhysteresis can all be analyzed.\nThree classes of perturbations are considered: memoryless, NTV, exponentially\nstable LTI, and general nonlinear dynamic.\nThe theoretical basis of the stability condition Is on the theorem of absolute stability\nfor the first class of perturbations and the\ntheorem of hyperstability for the latter two.\nThese perturbations are represented in\nterms of a lower bound involving an inner\nproduct and an upper bound on the norm.\nThe stability condition then shows tradeoffs between the two bounds. When only\nthe bound on the norm is imposed, the Hoo\nstability criterion is recovered. Because\nthe Lyapunov technique is used rather\nthan the multlvariable Nyquist theorem,\nnonlinear perturbations (both memoryless\nand dynamic) are permitted. For nonlinear\ndynamic systems, the smail"9ain condition\ninvolves truncated L2 norms.\nWhen the perturbation is characterized\nby a matrix that contains additional block\ndiagonal structure, a robustness margin is\nderived for each block. The derivation is\nbased on the generalization of the G:>rshgorin theorem to block-diagonal matrices.\nIf each of the diagonal blocks is of size one,\nthen a margin for positive and negative\nvariations of each diagonal element can be\nobtained by repeated application of the\n\npassMty argument to the feedforward subsystem with signs of some of its columns\nand rows reversed. An upper bound for the\n\'" measure is easily computed by use of the\nsame analysis.\nThis work was done by John Ting- Yung\nWen of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

(In the case of\nabsolute stability, the feedJack subsystem\nis memoryless and possibly time varying.\nFor hype rstabi Iity, the feedback system\ncan be a dynamical system.)\nIt had been shown previously (by the positive-realness lemma) that a sufficient condition for closed-loop exponential stability\nis the positive realness of some transfer\nfunction involving the feedforward subsystem. Later, this result was generalized to\nthe case of a dynamic feedback subsystem. This generalization, termed hyperstability, has become the cornerstone of the\nfield of adaptive control.\nPositive realness is typically stated as a\n\nfrequency-domain condition of the nonnegativity of the Hermitian part of the transfer function of a given stable LTI system. It\ncan be shown that if a system is positive\nreal, then it cannot generate energy. If, furthermore, the system is strictly positive\nreal, it dissipates energy. From the energy\npoint of view, the theorems of absolute\nstability and hyperstability simply state the\nconditions under which the system dissipates energy and thus is stable. Specifically, if both the feedforward and the feedback\nsubsystems dissipate energy, the system\nmust be stable.\nIn this paper, the proofs of stability in the\ninfinite-dirnensional Hilbert space are based\n\nAdvanced coating\nand laminating\ntechnology\nRexham custom coats and\nlaminates flexible films, foils,\nand papers for use in electronics,\naerospace materials, reprographics, and other highperformance applications.\nYou find resources developed\nduring 30 years\' work with highprecision projects\xe2\x80\xa2 Coating accuracy\ncapabilities in the\nmillionths\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Clean room manufacturing\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sophisticated on-line quality\ninspection\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Extensive analytical\ncapabilities\nCall for our Credentials Package.

Essentially, it is shO\'Ml\nthat if the state belongs to ~ under any L2 input, then the state is strongly asyrrptoticaJly\nstable. Using the foregoing result, it is\nshown that if the feedforward subsystem is\nstrictly positive real and the feedback subsystem is characterized by a nonnegative\noperator, then the system is exponentially\nstable. If the feedback subsystem is dissipative in the sense of Popov\'s inequality,\nthen the interconnected system is asymptotically stable. If a stronger exponential\nPopov\'s inequality is satisfied, the interconnected system attains exponential stability.\nWhen the feedforward system is not strictly positive real and/or the feedback system\nis not dissipative, one would expect intuitively that if one of the subsystems dissipates "more energy" than the other could\ngenerate, stability would be preserved.\nThis heuristic notion is rigorized by the introduction of an index, called the v index for\nconvenience, that measures the closeness of a given system to positive realness\nin terms of the minimum amount of additional parallel dissipation needed for the\nsystem to be positive real. General conditions for the stability of the system can then\nbe stated in terms of the v index.\nThe amount of energy that the feedforward subsystem can generate is bounded\nby its v index. Hence, if the feedback subsystem under positive feedback by an\namount equaling the v index of the forward\nsubsystem remains diSSipative (in the\nsense of non negativity of the inner product\nof its input and output), the interconnected\nsystem is exponentially stable. The theorem of hyperstability states the same result\nexcept that the energy-dissipation criterion\nused for the feedback subsystem is in the\nsense of the L2 inner product between its\ninput and output (Le., via the Popov inequality). The type of stability of this more\ngeneral characterization of energy diSSipation is weakened to asymptotic stability\nunless a stronger exponential Popov inequality is satisfied, in which case exponential stability obtains.\nThe v index is a time-domain characterization, which, in general, is difficult to calculate directly. It is shown via the Hilbertspace version of the positive-realness\nlemma that the v index is equivalent to a\nfrequency-domain attribute, called the v F\nindex, which is based on the Hermitian part\nof the transfer function. Because the input\nand output spaces are finite-dimensional,\nthe v F index, and hence the v index, can be\neasily computed. The utility of these results\nis demonstrated in an application to the\nanalysis of the robustness of an infinite-dimension linear quadratic regulator. It is\nshown that the generalization of the\nclassical (V2,OO) gain margin and (-~\nphase margin hold for this case.

The report\nshould be of interest to those concerned\nwith the design of multiple-axis controllers\nin aircraft, armored vehicles, industrial machinery, and remote manipulators: the operator response or delay is critical to the\nstable and accurate operation of such systems.\nEach of the three controllers was installed in a Space Shuttle cockpit simulator. The Space Shuttle hand controller had\nthree degrees of freedom and nonlinear\ngearing. The more-conventional two-degree-of-freedom control stick had linear\ngearing and was equipped first with a stiff\nset of springs (heavy conventional stick),\nthen with a softer set of springs (light conventional stick). The Signal from the control\nstick was processed through the cockpit\nsimulator with a 4D-ms frame time, then\nsent to the critical-task tester. The total inherent delay between the pilot and the critical-task tester was 46 ms: 20 ms of sampling delay plus 26 ms of computation\ntime.\nThe critical-task tester is a specialized\nelectronic subsystem used to measure the\npilot effective delay, T e, in response to a\nsimulated first-order, closed-loop, compensatory tracking task. The critical task involves an unstable controlled element, the\ninstability of which increases with time.\nEventually, the system reaches a critical\npoint beyond which the unstable system\ncannot be controlled. The amount of instability at that point gives a measure of Te\'\nThe critical-task tester was used to\nmeasure the Te values in the roll and pitch\naxes in each of the three control configurations. Measurements in each case were\nmade without additional system delay and\nwith 250 ms of additional system delay.\nThus, the total system delays were 46 and\n296 ms, respectively. The test subjects\nwere four test pilots and one nonpilot engineer.\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\nThe test data indicate that the heavy\nconventional stick had the lowest pilot effective time delays in both axes, both with\nand without the added system delay. The\nlight conventional stick had Te values similar to those of the Space ShUtlle controller.\nWith all three controllers, Te increased with\nthe added system delay. The increases in\nTe caused by the increase in system delay\nwere more significant than the differences\nin Te among the three controllers: apparently, at large system delays one controller\nis about as good as another.\nThis work was done by Cynthia M.\nPrivoznik and Donald T.

The absorption\nof a photon in such a device corresponds\nto the transition of an electron between the\nground and first excited state of a quantum\nwell formed by the discontinuity in the energy of the conduction band between a GaAs\nwell and an AJ x 1 _.jls barrier. The photoGa\nexcited charge carriers then tunnel out of\nthe well and are collected with the aid of an\napplied electric field.\nThe proposed device is based on the\nsplitting of the energy level that occurs\nwhen two quantum wells are placed so\nclose together that the wave functions of\nthe quantized energy levels overlap. The\ndetector absorbs photons, the energy of\n\nters of quantum wells of the proposed device are less severe than those of singlewell devices. HCJvVever, energy levels near\nthe tops of the wells are still necessary so\nthat the photoexcited carriers can tunnel\nout.

Reluctant glass formers are materials that require cooling rates greater\nthan 100Gls to form glasses. Laser spin\nmelting, a prior technique, can be used\nonly at COOling rates greater than about\n1,000 \xc2\xb0Cts and only for very small samples.\nThe new apparatus can be used to examine the glass-formation ability of a material and the critical cooling rate to form a\nglass from it.\nThe apparatus (see Figure 1) includes\nan ellipsoidal furnace, which focuses radiation from a tungsten/halogen lamp onto\na sample. The sample is supported between the two leads of a type S thermocouple that has a junction bead 0.005 in.\n(0.13 mm) in diameter. Raising the power to\nthe lamp melts the sample, causing it to\nflow around the thermocouple bead. A\nspecimen in a still atmosphere can be\ncooled at rates from 10 to 250 \xc2\xb0Gls by reducing the lamp power at the appropriate\nrate with a variable-speed, motor<iriven, adjustable transformer. Higher COOling rates\nare obtained by blowing helium gas onto\nthe sample after turning the lamp off.\nThe temperature of the sample is derived\nfrom the thermocouple signal. During\nquenching, the temperature of the sample\nis recorded on a strip chart and/or in a microcomputer data-acquisition system.

Such predetection\nrange compression can be useful in infrared-imaging systems because typical\nscenes contain bright spots (e.g., solar\nradiation reflected from automobiles) on\ndark backgrounds, and the bright/dark\ncontrast exceeds the dynamic ranges of\nphotodetectors, causing their output\nsignals to saturate. When fully developed,\nan effective dynamic-range-compressor\nplate, film, or coating would reduce the apparent contrast of the scene imaged on the\ndetector plane to within the dynamic range\nof the detectors (see Figure 1); the original\nimage contrast or intensity data could be\nrecovered subsequently in electronic image processing because the range-compression function and its inverse would be\nknown.\nThe proposed dynamic-range compressor would be made of photorefractive crystals. The two-wave-mixing process that\noccurs in such crystals attenuates the\nradiation passing through them. Because\nthe process is nonlinear, the degree of attenuation is greater at higher intensities.\nThus, a compressor plate would darken\nthe bright spots more strongly than it would\ndarken the other portions of an image.\nOne useful range-compression function\nis\n\nSaturation\nRegions\n\nInput\nIntensity\n"\n\nPredetection,Dynamic-Range ./ ./\n\n"\n\n"\',: ~:~:-/\n~~\n\n_ _::1\n\n~J/\n~\n\nI\n\n,4\n\nI\n\n_I\n\nI\n\nI\n\nCompressed\nInput Range\n\nInput Dynamic Range\n\nFigure 1.

A major problem in the preparation of specimens is obtaining durable\nspecimens in a simple and consistent\nfashion. A new technique can be used to\nprepare 3-mm-diameter specimens of\ncross sections of oxides of alloys intended\nfor use at temperatures greater than approximately 600 \xc2\xb0C (see figure).\nThe alloy of interest is cut into bars approximately 1.5 mm by 0.75 mm by 10 mm.\nOnly one of the large faces of each bar\nneed be prepared for oxidation treatments.\nThe bars are oxidized at the appropriate\nexperimental conditions. After the bars are\ncooled, a thin coat of silver paint is applied\nto the prepared surface of each bar. The\npainted surfaces are placed and held together until the paint dries. This provides\n\nMetal\nSubstrates\n\nenough strength for handling of the specimen-bar sandwich.\nThe sandwich is then placed in a specially-designed stainless-steel mold and\nheld in place with setscrew pins. The purpose of the mold is to hold the sandwich in\nplace inside a 3-mm-diameter bore, into\nwhich a molten alloy is injected. After the\nsandwich is aligned in the mold, a chunk of\nZn(4 atomic percentVAl(1 atomic percentV\nCu alloy is placed in the riser portion of the\nmold. This alloy was chosen because of its\nlow melting temperature (415\xc2\xb0C), sufficient\nstrength, and high coefficient of thermal\nexpansion.\nThe entire mold is heated quickly with an\noxyacetylene torch until the alloy is molten.\nA glass tube connected to a rubber bulb is\nplaced over the riser and in contact with\nthe mold. A blast of air causes the molten\nalloy to flow around and encapsulate the\nspecimen-bar sandwich. After removal\nfrom the mOld, the resulting 3-mm specimen bar is sliced into TEM specimens by\n\nCasting\nDie _ _\n\nRiser\n\nuse of a slow diamond saw. Finally, the\nspecimens are polished, dimpled, and ionthinned.\nThe primary advantage of this technique\nis that durable specimens can be prepared\nconsistently in a very short time. In addition, epoxy resins are not used, and organic sOlvents can be used to clean the specimens. Yet another advantage is that two\ndifferent experimental conditions can be\nincorporated into one specimen.\nOne of the disavantages of this technique is that specimens of materials that\nwould be affected by the high casting temperature are not suitable. Furthermore,\nduring the ion-thinning process, the zinc\nalloy is often sputter-deposited on the area\nof interest, requiring subtraction of additional background signals from quantitative-chemical-analysis spectra.\nThis work was done by Joseph Doychak\nof Sverdrup Technology Inc. for Lewis Research Center.

Con55\n\nsequently, the equation is universal in the\nsense that it applies to a variety of substances, including ionic, metallic, covalent,\nand rar~s solids. Only three parameters\nare needed to describe the equation for a\ngiven material.\nThe equation gives the pressure, p. at a\nfIXed temperature, T, as a function of the\nrelative size, X\nP(X, T)\n3B r [(1 - X)/X2] exp [\'7~1 - x)]\nwhere Br the isothermal bulk modulus\nat zero pressure, X\n(VNJ V3, V the\nvolume at pressure p. and Vo\nthe equi\xc2\xb7\nlibrium volume (the volume at zero pres\xc2\xb7\nsure).

A gas\n(e.g., H2\' 2, He, Ne, N2, 02\' AI, or OO~ is\npassed through an array of capillary tubes,\nthen through a series of apertures to form a\nwell-collimated, well-defined beam of molecules. This beam is crossed by a beam of\nelectrons with kinetic energies greater\nthan the ionization potential of the molecules and with an energy spread less than\n300 mV. Some of the collisions between\nelectrons and molecules produce singly\nionized molecules that travel toward the\nentrance aperture of the mass spectrometer, and scattered electrons, the kinetic energies of which are diminished by the\namounts lost in production of the ions.\nThe electrons scattered at some arbitrarily chosen angle 8 are analyzed in energy and detected by a multichannel amplifying plate or other suitable charged-particle\ndetector. Each detected electron gives rise\nto an electrical pulse that is shaped, amplified, and sent to a pulse counter: it is assumed that each pulse at a specified scattered-electron energy corresponds to an\nion that has begun to travel toward the entrance of the mass spectrometer. The electron-detector output is also fed through a\nvariable-delay unit to start a time-to-pulseheight converter.\nAnother charged-particle detector,\nanother pulse shaper, and another amplifier form a pulse for each ion that arrives at\nthe output end of the mass spectrometer.\nEach ion pulse serves as the stopping\npulse for the time-to-pulse-height converter. Between the starting and stopping\npulses, there is a time correlation for those\ndetected ions that were produced by detected electrons.

Under certain assumptions regarding\nthe inelastic scattering of electrons, the electronlion-coincidence count is a direct measure\nof the transmission efficiency of the spectrometer.\n\nand electrons, there is no time correlation.\nThus, the output of the time-to-pulse-height\nconverter includes uncorrelated pulses\nspread over a wide range of time intervals,\nplus correlated pulses spread over a fixed\ntime interval, as shown in the output of a\npulse-height analyzer.\nThe transmission efficiency of the mass\nspectrometer is taken to be the ratio of the\nnumber of time-correlated pulses to the\nnumber of electron pulses. The measurement can be repeated for each of the various gases to obtain the transmission effi\xc2\xb7\nciency for the molecular mass of each.\nThis work was done by Santosh K.\nSrivastava of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Pro-\n\npulsion Laboratory.

The lamp head\ncontains electric-are-stabilization and deionized-water cooling systems.

Also, the deionized water cools the reflector, removes\n\nelectrode debris from the inside surface of\nthe tube, and cools the quartz tUbe. After\nthe water has passed through the quartz\ntube, it is filtered within the service module\nand then cooled within the heat exchanger.\n\nPERFORMANCE ...\nIREQUEST FOR QUOTEI\nPRECISION MOLDING TO :\n.000S " .

The report presents a theoretical\nanalysis of the responses of a hot-wire\nprobe to changes in the flow; it also compares measurements by a hot-wire probe\nwith measurements of the same flows by\nlaser-induced fluorescence (LI F). Because\nLlF provides spatially and temporally resolved data on temperature, density, and\npressure, it provides independent means\nto determine the responses of hot-wire anemometers to these quantities.\nThe usual objective of hot-wire an emometry is to measure the fluctuations in\nthe mass flux, which is a product of flow\nspeed and density. However, a hot wire\ndoes not respond to mass flux alone but to\na combination of mass flux and total temperature, the total temperature being the\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\ntemperature of a stagnation point in the\nflow. While comparisons of hot-wire anemometry with laser doppler velocimetry\ncan provide partial speed calibrations, they\nprovide no information on responses to\nfluctuations in density and temperature.\nThe basic equation of hot-wire anelTlOmetry is a linearized expression for the\nfluctuation in the voltage across a hot wire\nimmersed in a flow:\n(AElE) = SriWQ) + SJAUlU} + S.,{ATfT)\nwhere E = the voltage, Q = the density, U\n= the speed, T = thetotaltemperature,S\nthe sensitMty to the subscripted quantity, and A denotes the fluctuation in the\nassociated quantity.

This\npartial derivative is useful in computations\n\n=\n\nSQ~SU\nSm\nwhere m = QU = mass flux. The theoretical analysis explores the mathematical\nconsequences of these equations under\nvarious assumed flow conditions to derive\nequations for three different calibration\nmethods.\nThe first two methods are based on the\nconcept of "single high overheat": the wire\nis operated at such a high temperature that\nit is sensitive only to mass flux and not to\nfluctuations of temperature in the flow. In\nthe first method (the centerline method),\nmeasurements are made at the center line\nof a wind tunnel, where the flow is relatively\nfree of disturbances. The stagnation pressure, and consequently the mass flux (but\nnot the mach number), is varied from run to\nrun. The second method (the boundarylayer method), which is less vulnerable to\ncertain calibration errors, involves measurements of the boundary-layer flow with\nmass flow estimated from pitot-static\nmeasurements by the standard equations\nof compressible flow. The third method is\nmore complicated: through measurements at various wire temperatures (multiple overheats) and statistical analysis, it\nprovides for the determination of both Sm\nand Sr.\nThe three methods were applied to a\nmach 2.1 flow of nitrogen in a blowdown\nwind tunnel and compared with LI F measurements. As a result, the following conclusions were drawn:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The boundary-layer and centerline methods give the same measurements of mass\nflux. The boundary-layer method minimizes errors, but the centerline method\nmay be easier and more reliable for the\nmeasurement of some complicated flows.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A hot wire can be operated at a single high\noverheat or at multiple overheats to measure fluctuations in the mass flux.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If a high overheat is used to measure only\nfluctuations in mass flux, then root-meansquare fluctuations of temperature and\ndensity cannot be determined accurately.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If multiple-overheat measurements are\ntaken of the mass flux, the total temperaNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\n9.80 -\n\nRADIOGRAPHY\nRadiography is just one 01 the many applications possible\nwith Kevex X-RAY\'s patented portable X\xc2\xb7ray source, the PXS.\nThe PXS can create new market opportunities for your products.

Internal pores\nare readily closed by HIP, but surface voids\nlike cracks and pores that are in contact\nwith the pressurizing gas are not healed.\nThe proposed coat would be easy to apply,\nwould separate the voids from the sur\xc2\xb7\nrounding gas, would not react with the\nmetal part under treatment, and would be\neasy to remove after pressing.\nThe coat would be applied to a casting\nor weldment as a thick slurry of two glass\npowders: one (component A), which melts\nat a temperature slightly lower than that\nused for HIP, and another (component B),\nwhich melts at a higher temperature. For\nexample, powder A could be a glass of 75\npercent Si0 2 and 25 percent Nap, while\nthe other powder could be Si0 2 (see figure). The liquid component of the slurry\ncould be a fugitive organic binder; for example, a mixture of cellulose acetate and\nacetone.\nMost casting defects at surfaces occur\nin "hotspots" - areas where heat is not\nconducted away fast enough during solidification. Such areas are often inaccessible. The slurry should readily flow to them,\nhowever, after being brushed on a casting.\nThe user does not have to worry about applying too much slurry - it should come\noff easily after HIP.\nIn the case of the NaplSi02 material\nmentioned above, as the temperature is\nraised to about 825\xc2\xb0C during hot isostatic\npressing, the lower-melting glass should\nfirst melt; but then the glasses should\nreact, and the melting point should rise so\nthat the glass mixture should harden. With\nthe proper choice of the relative amounts\nof each glass, the mixture should form a\ncoat stiff enough to protect against the gas\npressures of 15,000 Ib/in. 2 (100 MPa) typically used in HIP.\nWhen pressing is complete, the casting\nwould be cooled to room temperature. The\nglass coat should shrink faster than the\ncasting WOUld.

These discontinuities give rise to interlaminar stresses even when the remote loading is in the\nplane of the laminations. Clearly, it would\nbe useful to be able to model delamination\nmathematically and predict its onset for a\ngiven loading condition at a specified discontinuity.\nA report presents a fracture-mechanics\napproach to analyzing, characterizing, and\ndesigning against delamination. In the\nstudy, examples of delamination problems\n\nare illustrated wherein the strain-energyrelease rate associated with the growth of\ndelamination has been found to be a useful\ngeneric parameter, independent of thickness, layup, and source of delamination,\nfor the characterization of failure by delamination. Several techniques for the calculation of strain-energy-release rates for delaminations from a variety of sources are\noutlined. A technique for the quantification\nof durability due to cyclic loading is presented.\nOne example of this approach is the\nanalysis of edge delamination. In this case,\nthe strain-energy-release rate is related\nthrough an equation to the remotely a~\nplied strain, the thickness of the laminate,\nand the modulus of the laminate with and\nwithout the delamination. The strain-energy-release rate is independent of the size of\nthe delamination and the orientation of the\nlayup. A critical strain for delamination is\nidentified, and this is used to calculate a\ncritical strain-energy-release rate, which is\nthen used to calculate the remotely applied\nstrains required to propagate a delamination for a number of different fiber orientations. These predictions, for the case of\nedge delamination, closely approximate\nexperimentally-determined strain values.\nTo model delaminations involving mixedmode fracture, a finite-element approach\nis used to calculate the three components\n\nof the strain-energy-release rate: G, unterlaminar tension), Gil unterlaminar sliding\nshear), and Gil\' O\nnterlaminar scissoring\nshear). The total G is then determined by\nsumming these components. This technique can be applied to different geometries, calculating the strain-energy-release\nrate components for several different\nsources of delamination.\nThis work was done by T.

COR FIG generates the corrector figure in the form of a\nspline data-point table and/or a list of polynomial coefficients. The number of spline\ndata points as well as the number of coefficients are specified by the user.\nRrst, the parameters of the optical system (thicknesses, radii of curvature, and\nthe like) are entered. COR FIG traces the\noutermost axial real ray through the uncorrected system to determine approximate\nradial limits for all rays. Then several real\nrays are traced backward through the system from the image to the surface that originally followed the object, within these\nradial limits. At this first surface, the local\ncurvature is adjusted on a small scale to direct the rays toward the object, thus removing any accumulated aberrations.\nFor each ray traced, this adjustment is\ndifferent, so that at the end of this process\nthe resultant surface is made up of many\nlocal curvatures. The equations that describe these local surfaces, expressed as\nhigh-order polynomials, are then solved simultaneously to yield the final surface figure, from which data points are extracted.\nFinally, a spline table or list of polynomial\ncoefficients is extracted from these data\npoints.\nCORFIG is intended to be used in the\nlate stages of optical design. The design of\nthe system must have at least a good paraxial foundation. Preferably, the design\nshould be at a stage at which traditional\nmethods of correction of Seidel aberrations do not bring the size of an image spot\nwithin specification.\nCORFIG reads the system parameters\nof such a design and calculates the optimum figure for the first surface such that\nall of the original parameters remain unchanged. Depending upon the system,\nCORFIG can reduce the root-mean-square\nImage-spot radius by a factor of 5 to 25.\n70\n\nThe original parameters (magnification,\nback focal length, and the like) are maintained because all rays upon which the\ncorrector figure is based are traced within\nthe bounds of the outermost ray of the original system. For this reason, the original\nsystem must have a certain degree of integrity.\nCORFIG optimizes the figure of the corrector surface for on-axis images at a\nsingle wavelength only. However, it has\nbeen demonstrated many times that the\nmethod of CORFIG also Significantly improves the quality of field images and images formed at wavelengths other than the\ndesign wavelength.\nCORFIG is written completely in VIV<\nFORTRAN. It has been implemented on a\nDEC VIV<-series computer under VMS with\na central-memory requirement of 55K\nbytes. The program was developed in\n\n1986.\nThis pr~ram was written by A.

(SMARTQUERY is an OMNIBASE software product\nthat uses special function keys for the\nstorage and retrieval of data records.)\nDOE provides three main advantages:\n(1) The user works with the table names\nand field names rather than with table\nnumbers and field numbers, (2) DOE provides online access to definitions of datadictionary keys, and (3) DOE provides a\ndisplayed summary list that shows, for\neach datum, which data-dictionary entries\ncurrently exist for any specific relation or\nattribute.\nThe DOE data screen is an OMNIBASE\n\nSMAATDESIGN screen with two windows.\nThe top window retrieves relation (table)\ndescriptions and attribute (field) descriptions. The bottom window retrieves definitions of data-dictionary keys. DOE allows\nusers to switch back and forth between the\ntwo windows without interfering with retrievals in progress in either window.\nThe DOE application program was developed for specific use: that of review and\nediting of records in the OMNIBASE "descriptions" relation (table). However, the\nroutines that allow more than one retrieval\nsequence to be in progress at the same\ntime can be adapted for use in other OMNIBASE applications.\nDOE was developed on a DEC VIV< 750\ncomputer under VMS 3.6. Implementation\nof DOE requires a Brittain Lee data-base\nmachine with 10M 500 and the OMNIBASE\nsoftware package. OMNIBASE is available\nfrom Signal Technology, Inc.

ACTON reads the geometric data of a drawing from the Data Exchange File (DXF) used in AutoCAD and\nother PC-based drafting programs.\nThe geometric entities recognized by\nACTON include POINT\'s, LINE\'s, SOLID\'s,\n3DLlNE\'s, and 3D FACE\'s.

The NASTRAN elements created include CBAR\'s, CTRIA\'s,\nCQUAD4\'s, CPENTA\'s, and CHEXA\'s. The\nbulk data deck can be used to create a full\nNASTRAN deck. It is assumed that the\nuser has at least a working knowledge of\nAutoCAD and NASTRAN.\nACTON was written in Microsoft QuickBasic (Version 2.0).

This\napproach offers the potential for determining damage as a function of the change in\nthe relationship between applied and absorbed energies as the applied energy is\nsuccessively increased with each impact.\nThe concept also provides the potential for\nmeasuring behavior during impact, and the\nenergy relationships are retrievable from\noscilloscope traces of the impact.\nThe tester includes two identical flat\nspring blades set vertically and parallel to\neach other (see figure). The blades are\nclamped at the bottom to a massive plate\nthat acts as a baseplate for the whole unit.\nAt the upper ends, the blades are clamped\nto a single, rectangular-beam-like mass\nthat spans the horizontal distance between\nthem. When the mass is pulled horizontally\nin a direction that causes the blades to\nbend about their weak axis, the beam remains horizontal. Upon release of the pulling force, the mass travels back and forth\nhorizontally with a decaying oscillatory\nmotion.\nStrain gauges installed on the blades\nmeasure the bending of the blades. A pair\nof back-to-back strain gauges mounted on\neach blade at a point other than at midheight, where strain is always zero, provides a signal proportional to the displacement of the blade at the moment of\nrelease.\nThe maximum kinetic energy of the osCillating mass is proportional to the volume\n\n~------------------------------------------------------,\n\nTube Under Test\n(Simply-Supported Beam)\nCocking\nMechanism\n\nSpring\nBlade\n\nAntlrebound\nLatch\nMechanism\n\nClamping\nBlock\n\nStrain Gauges\non Blade Give\nVelocity Reading\n\nBLADES BENT BACK\nIN COCKED POSITION\n\nThe Impactor Strikes the Specimen at the moment of maximum kinetic energy after\nthe spring blades are released from their cocked position.\n\nof the two blades, the elastic modulus of\nthe blade material, and the square of any\nmeasurable static elastic bending strain at\nthe moment of release, if damping is assumed to be zero. Damping is not zero, but\nits highly repeatable effect can be measured, calibrated, and taken into account so\nthat the maximum kinetic energy can be\npredictably set by monitoring and adjusting\nthe static bending strain at the instant of\nrelease. The specimen is placed so that a\nspecial anvil attached to the mass strikes it\nat midoscillation, the moment of maximum\nkinetic energy.\nOther features include a hydraulic actuator to pull the mass to its release position;\na special releasing latch that provides a\nclean, sharp release actuated by the tap of\n\nan ordinary hammer; and a special latch\nthat allows the mass to pass through the location of maximum kinetic energy only\nonce. This second latch prevents repeated, oscillatory blows to the specimen. Because the energy available is a function of\nthe volume of the spring-blade material, a\nminimum of space is required for operation\nand storage. The impact tester is compact\nand portable and is both easy and safe to\nuse.\nThis work was done by Alan M.

The algorithm has been\nused to predict laminar, turbulent, and hypersonic flONS.\nThe development begins with the classical equations for the two-dimensional, vis-\n\ncous flow of a gas in thermodynamic equilibrium. The fkMI is characterized by Cartesian\ncomponents of velocity as functions of position and time. The dependent variables\ninclude the mass density, total energy per\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\nunit mass, pressure, and temperature. The\npressure is obtained from an equation of\nstate, as a function of the ratio of specific\nheats and the difference between the densities of total and kinetic energy. The\nNavier-Stokes equations are written in the\nform of conservation laws for the fluxes of\nmass, momentum, and energy, with source\nterms based on scalar coefficients of\nviscosity and thermal conductivity.\nThe steady-state Navier-Stokes equations are put in an implicit finite-<Jifference\nform that can be solved by approximate\nNewton iteration. Because of the rapid\ngrowth in the number of arithmetical operations with the number of cells in the finite-difference mesh, such systems of\nequations have previously been solved indirectly by relaxation methods.\nThe LU-SSOR scheme is a new relaxation method that combines the advantanges of LU factorization with Gauss-Seidel\nrelaxation . The vectorizable LU-SSOR\nscheme, which is based on central differences, requires scalar diagonal inversions.\nThe application of the scheme to the approximate Newton iteration of the NavierStokes equations yields a set of equations\nthat require no implicit smoothing on the\nleft side. Only adaptive, total-variation-<Jiminishing, flux-limited dissipation terms\nare added to the right side.\nThe algorithm was able to simulate a\nsubsonic, viscous, laminar flow past an airfoil (see figure). It also performed well when\napplied to a subsonic, viscous, turbulent\nflow past an airfoil and to two hypersonic,\ninviscid flows past an inlet.\nThis work was done by Seokkwan Yoon\nof SVerdrup Technology, Inc., for Lewis\nResearch Center.

Uke a valve, the vortex generator can vary the rate of flow of\nthe primary fluid from its maximum value\ndown to zero. When properly designed, it\nrequires a low pressure differential between the primary and secondary streams\nand expends a relatively small amount of\nsecondary fluid.\nThe vortex generator consists of a disklike short, hollow cylinder in which the primary fluid enters radially at two opposed\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\npoints while two secondary streams enter\ntangentially at points 90\xc2\xb0 from the primary\nstreams (see figure). An exit port is located\nat the center of one end of the cylinder.\nThe primary fluid enters through slots\nthat extend the height of the cylinder. Without any secondary flow, the primary\nstreams flow directly from their entrance\nports to the central exit port. When the secondary streams are introduced (at a smaller volume and greater velocity), they set up\na circular flow that gradually spirals inward\nSecondary, or Con t ro l, Flows entering\ntangentially through diametrically opposite\nports set up a swirling motion that restrains\nthe primary flow. The pressure of the secondary fluid In relation to that of the\nprimary fluid is the controlling factor.\n\nl~\n\nSecondary\nControl\nPort\n\nPrimary\nPort\n\n73\n\nto the exit port.\nThe rotating fluid exerts pressure against\nthe periphery of the cylinder in proportion\nto the square of the circumferential velocity of the fluid and inversely proportional to\nthe radius of the cylinder. This centrifugal\npressure acts against the primary-fluid inlet ports as well as against the wall. Thus,\nthe greater the speed of the secondary\nfluid, the smaller the flow from the primary\ninlet ports. When the centrifugal pressure\nequals the primary inlet pressure, the\nprimary flow stops. At that point, the only\nfluid leaving the exit port is the secondary\nfluid.\nIn an experimental version of the valve\n\nwith air as the fluid, a secondary pressure\nof only 100 psi (0.69 MPa) created enough\ncircumferential flow to cut off the primary\nflow at a supply pressure of 80 psi (0.55\nMPa). The secondary flow aids in remOving\nparticles previously entrained in the primary flow that have been dropped in the\nvortex generator.

Uke a heat pipe, this system requires no pump or externally supplied\npower to circulate the heat-transfer fluid,\nrelying instead on the flow of heat in its\nevaporator and condenser sections to do\nthe pumping. Unlike in a heat pipe, in which\nthe liquid and vapor flow in opposite directions, the liquid and vapor in the capillarycondenser-pumped loop flow in the same\ndirection.\nIn some respects, the capillary-condenser-pumped loop is essentially a capillary-evaporator-pumped loop operating in\nreverse. The loop (see figure) is filled with\nthe fluid in both liquid and vapor phases.\nHeat is added to the liquid phase along the\nevaporator section (an ordinary pipe with\nno wick structure), causing the liquid to\nvaporize. Heat is removed in the relatively\nshort condenser section, causing the vapor to condense.\nThe condenser section contains a nonwettable, porous wick structure in thermal\ncontact with an external heat sink. (The\ncorresponding section of a capillary evaporator pump would contain a porous, wettable wick.) The pressure is at a minimum\nin the vapor condensing in the wick and at\na maximum in the liquid that has just condensed. The capillary pressure due to the\nsurface tension of the liquid in the wick is\nthe source of this difference in pressure\nand balances the pressure lost in pumping\nthe fluid around the loop. The pressure in\nthe condensed liquid pushes this liquid out\nof the condenser, causing the fluid to flow\nonce again around the loop.\nWhereas a capillary evaporator pump\nmust be placed at a heat source, the capillary condenser pump can be placed at a\nheat sink. Thus, a capillary-condenserpump heat-transfer loop is preferable\nwhere the heat-input (evaporator) length is\ngreater than the available heat-rejection\n(condenser) length. This situation exists,\nfor example, where the surface of a hypersonic airplane has to be cooled by transporting the aerodynamically generated\nheat to a central hydrogen-fuel heat sink.\nThe capillary-condenser-pumped loop\noffers the following additional advantages:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Because only a small fraction of the loop is\nfilled with liquid, the weight is lower than\nthat of a forced-convection loop, which\nmust be filled completely.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The internal pressure is limited to the\nsaturation pressure of the heat-transfer\nfluid, whereas in an all-liquid forcedNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\nCondenser Section\n(Heat Out)\nLiquid Flowing\nFrom Condenser\n\nLiquid\n\ni E"po~to,\n\n..,,",\n\n(Heat In)\n\n~\n\nCAPILLARY\xc2\xb7CONDENSER\xc2\xb7PUMPED HEAT\xc2\xb7TRANSFER LOOP\n\nVapor Entering\nCapillary Condenser Pump\n\nHotter\nSide\n\nI~\n\nLiquid Leaving\nCapillary Condenser Pump\n\nt\n\nNonwettable\nWick\n\n, ,\n\n~~~---r----I\n\nJ\n\nL\n\nrr / / /\n\n=----~ -~\n\nSide\nCOlderl\n\n~~\n\ni\n\nWettable\nWick\n\nVapor Leaving\nCapillary Evaporator Pump\n\nLiquid Entering\nCapillary Evaporator Pump\n\nHEAT EXCHANGER\n\nThe Caplllary\xc2\xb7Condenser\xc2\xb7Pumped Heat\xc2\xb7Transfer Loop Is similar to a heat pipe and to a capll\xc2\xb7\nlary-evaporator-pumped heat\xc2\xb7transfer loop In that the heat-transfer fluid Is pumped by the\nevaporation and condensation of the fluid at the heat source and sink, respectively. A capll\xc2\xb7\nlary condenser pump can be combined with a capillary evaporator pump (below) to form a\nheat exchanger that circulates the heat\xc2\xb7transfer fluids In both loops.\n\nconvection system, the internal pressure\nmay be several times as high. The lower\nintemal pressure may permit the use of\nthinner tubing, thus reducing weight even\nfurther.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The transport of heat is more nearly\nisothermal than in older heat-transport\nsystems of similar capacity. Thus, thermal\nstress in the loop is reduced, and less ex\xc2\xb7\nternal surface area is needed in the con\xc2\xb7\ndenser section for the rejection of heat to\n\nthe heat sink.\nThis work was done by Calvin C.

The method is both faster and\nmore robust than other approximate meth\xc2\xb7\nods of the same type. The method is suitable for use in preliminary calculations for\ndesign and for off-design operation of turbomachinery.\nThe method involves the following assumptions:\n1. The flow is turbulent everywhere but in\nother respects can be treated as though it\nw-ere steady everywhere.\n2. The fluid is a perfect gas.\n3. The flow in the boundary layers is twodi\xc2\xb7\nmensional, without a crossflow component.\n4. The flow surfaces are adiabatic.\n5.

The flow in the core can be treated as\nthough it were one<limensional, in the\nsense that the two-dimensional equations\nof the conservation of momentum and\nmass can be reduced to one<limensional\nequations in the coordinate along a\nstreamline.\nThe equations of conservation of momentum and mass are integrated through\nthe boundary layers, and some additional\nassumptions regarding the geometrical\nproperties of the streamlines are invoked.\nHead\'s entrainment relation is introduced\nto find the perpendicular component of\nvelocity at the edge of the boundary layer.\nThe skin-friction coefficient is obtained\nfrom the Ludwig-Tillman relation. The variation of free-stream velocity is determined\nvia the simple one~ i mensional equation of\n\ncontinuity for the flow in the core. The set of\nequations is completed with the energy\nequation and the equation of state of the\nflow in the core, which are used to relate\nthe static temperature, pressure, and density to the other quantities.\nThe foregoing constitute a set of simUltaneous one<limensional differential equations that are solved together to find the\nflow field. Because no iteration is involved,\nthe solution is found rapidly - that is, the\nintegration is performed in one pass along\nthe channel. With some modifications and\nadditional assumptions, the equations can\nalso be solved for flow with merged boundary layers and no isentropic core ("fully\ndeveloped" flow) and for separated flow.\nThe method has been applied to round\nand rectangular conical diffuser channels\n(see figure). The calculated pressure coefficients and other quantities of interest\n\nwere in good agreement with experimental\nvalues in cases in which the analysis indicated no separation of flow.

The STNSTS Can Be Structurally\nTailored in both tension and compression\nconfigurations.\n\nWhen the snap through occurs, a large\ndeformation occurs as a result of a small\nincrement of the applied load. After the\nsnap through, the load/deflection response\nbecomes a function of stiffness of the inter\xc2\xb7\nnal spring and the membrane stiffness of\nthe bars. Additional stiffness can be provid\xc2\xb7\ned by restraints in contact with the spring\ncase. The restraints limit the deflection of\nthe internal spring/two-bar linkage. Once\nthe restraints make contact with the spring\ncase, the load/deflection response of the\nSTNSTS is a function of the stiffness of the\ninternal spring, the membrane stiffness of\nthe bars, and the stiffness of the spring\ncase.\nThe load/deflection response of the\nSTNSTS is tailorable by changing the size,\nstiffness, and orientation of its compo\xc2\xb7\nnents.

The purpose of the analysis was to\ndetermine whether any part of the abovementioned structures would be overstressed\nand overdeformed under the reentry heating, assuming one TPS tile had been lost at\nthe end of the reentry heating.\nThe wing-skin panel, which is reinforced\nby spanwise stringers of hat-shaped cross\nsection, was represented with an equivalent plate of uniform effective thickness.\nThe temperature distribution in the wingskin panel was chosen to represent the\nlikely cooling effect of the loss of one tile at\nthe center of the panel at the end of the\nreentry heating. The temperature of the\ncentral square-shaped region of the panel\nwas assumed to be 180 \xc2\xb0 (82 0q,while the\nrest of the panel was assumed to be at\n320 OF (160 0c).\nThe first problem was to determine\nwhether the compressive stresses induced\nin the panel immediately outside the cooled\nregion would be sufficient to cause skin\nbuckling. The stresses in the panel were\ncalculated by use of the NASA structural\nanalysis (NASTRAN) computer program.\nThe peak chordwise compressive stresses\npredicted by NASTRAN were 4960 Ib/in. 2\n(34.2 MPa) and 2650 Ib/in.2 (18.3 MPa),\nrespectively, under free-edge and fixededge conditions. The critical buckl ing\nstress in the chordwise direction calculated from the classical buckling theory\nwas 36121b/in.2 (24.9 MPa). Thus, if the actual edge condition is close to the freeedge condition , then the skin panel immediately outside the cool region may reach\nthe elastic instability in the chordwise direction.\nThe next problem was to determine\nwhether the thermal deflection of the skin\npanel could tear the SIP. The maximum\nchordwise compressive stress in the skin\npanel calculated by NASTRAN could produce a maximum deflection of 0.0246 in.\n(0.63 mm), which could induce peak tensile\nstress of 18.14Ib/in.2 (125 kPa) in the SIP.\nThis stress level is considerably less than\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\nthe tensile strength [40 Iblin.2 (276 kPa)] of\nthe SIP. Thus, the SIP is unlikely to be torn.\nRnally, thermal-stress analysis was performed on the TPS tile that was subject to\nthe most severe temperature gradient during the reentry heating. The tensile stress\ninduced in the TPS was found to be much\nless than the tensile strength of the TPS tile.\nFor the worst case, that in which the skinpanel and the TPS tile deform in opposite\ndirections, the combined deflections of the\nskin panel and the TPS tile could induce\n33.72 Ib/in.2 (232.5 kPa) tensile stress in the\nSIP. This is about 84 percent of the tensile\nstrength of the SIP. Thus, the combined\ndeformations of the TPS tile and the skin\npanel are unlikely to tear the SIP.\nThis work was done by William L Ko and\nJerald M. Jenkins of Ames Research\nCenter.

The redb.lceddynamic technique is formed from a combination of the dynamic and geometric\n(nondynamic) tracking techniques, and it\ncombines the advantages of both to increase the accuracy of the estimated orbit\nunder conditions in which neither is clearly\nsuperior.\nThe simplest technique is geometriC\ntracking by use of instantaneous measurements to four or more GPS satellites. This\ntechnique is completely free of errors in\nthe assumed dynamics but is vulnerable to\nmeasurement noise, ephemeriS error, and\na factor called position dilution of precision,\n\nThe Position\n\nTransducer\nwith Good\nConnections\n\nNovotechnik\'s LWH\nseries of conductiveplastic position transducers\ncomes with whichever connector you need: DIN 43650 (models\nLWH & LWG), Binder (LWB & LW), or\nAmphenol (LWC). The LWH series also gives you\nhigh resolution (.01 mm) and a range of stroke\nlengths from 150 to 1200mm. The transducers\nmay be built directly into your mechanical system,\nwithout need of motion conversion or linkage mechanisms.\nImproved design of the LWH transducer eliminates\noffset errors and ensures reliable contact of the elastometer-damped wiper. Outstanding Iinearities of up to \xc2\xb1 .05%\nare available (up to \xc2\xb1 .01 % on special order), as well as life\nexpectancies of up to 100 x 106 operations.

At best, the tracking accuracy approaches a few meters.\nIn dynamic tracking, the dynamics of\nthe satellite are constrained, and noisy instantaneous measurements of the state\n(POSition or velocity or both) of the satellite\ntaken during an interval of time are combined to reduce the measurement noise\nand to yield greater information concerning the state at a single instant of time. At\nthe same time, the estimates of the orbits\nof the GPS satellites are also improved to\nreduce their contributions to the error of\nthe estimated state of the satellite in question. The transition from the states of the\nsatellites at the times of the measuremel\'lts\nto the states at the time of interest is furnished by integration of the equations of\nmotion, which are governed by the forces\n(dynamics) acting upon the satellites\nduring the interval. Any mismodeling of\nthese dynamics results in systematic errors in the state. These errors tend to grow\nas the data arc length increases.\nIn nondynamic tracking, the instantaneous user satellite positions are still determined by differential GPS pseudorange\nmeasurements; however, the transition between positions at different times is furnished by the satellite positional change inferred from continuous differential GPS\ncarrier phase measurements. Because\n\ncarrier phase can be tracked with extremely high accuracy, very accurate state\ntransition can be inferred from carrier\nphase. This approach is completely free\nfrom satellite dynamic errors. In exchange,\nhowever, it is highly sensitive to weak 0bserving geometry.\nNondynamic tracking discards orbit dynamic models and the associated information entirely. This is one of the principal attractions of the nondynamic technique.\nNot only is sensitMty to model errors eliminated, but the complexity of the solution\nprocess is greatly reduced. Nevertheless,\nit is reasonable that if dynamic and nondynamic tracking are good separately, then\nan optimal combination of the two should\nbe even better. In situations in which the\ngeometry is good and the dynamics are\npoorly known , the small additional improvement to be expected by adding in dynamics might not justify the greatly increased complexity. However, where the\ngeometry is poor and the dynamic models\nare reasonably good, the added dynamic\ninformation could lead to a substantial improvement. In the new technique, both dynamic and geometric information is used\nto propagate the state, with appropriate\nweight given to each method.\nThe reduced-dynamic technique can be\ndescribed mathematically in terms of a\nKalman sequential-filter formulation. This\n\ninvolves two steps: a time update, which\nmakes use of a state-transition model to\npropagate the estimate of the state and the\ncovariance of the state of the satellite from\none batch of data to the next, and a measurement update, which incorporates a new\nbatch of measurements. These two steps\nalternate until all batches of data are incorporated.\nThe weight on the dynamic information\nis controlled by adjusting a set of three\nprocess-noise parameters that represent a\nfictitious threEH:Jimensional force on the\nsatellite in question. The relative weight of\nthe dynamics is varied by selecting different values for the a priori unc.ertainty 00\'\nthe steady-state uncertainty 0, and the correlation time T for these process-noise parameters. An increase in Tand a decrease\nin 00 and 0 increases the weight on the dynamic information. WhenT-+oo, 0-+0, and\n00 -+0, the technique reduces to conventional dynamic tracking; when T-+0,0-+00,\nand 00 -+00, it becomes nondynamic tracking. It follows that an optimally-tuned reduced-dynamic solution must always be as\ngood as or better than both the purely dynamic and the purely nondynamic solutions.\nTo derive the full benefit of the reduceddynamic technique, it is necessary to give\nthe optimum weight to the dynamic model.\nThe weight can be predetermined through\n\nIf you can see the flaws,\nN\n\now there\'s a way to turn visual inspection into\nproblem prevention.

However, the\nperformance appears to be insensitive to\nthe relative weighting between the two\ntypes of information as long as it is not far\nfrom optimum. When the actual level of dynamic-model error is uncertain, an additional deweighting of the dynamic model is\nrecommended . Such biased weighting\nwould prevent an inordinately large error\nfrom arising due to misjudgment of the error in the dynamic model.\nThis work was done by Sien-Chong\nWu, Thomas P Yunck, and Catherine L\nThornton of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The hand features a compact rotary\ndrive and a butterfly configuration that\nsimplify the approach and gripping maneuvers of the robot.\nParallelogram linkages maintain the\nalignment of each jaw with the other jaws.\nOne bar of each linkage is connected to\none of two concentric, counter rotating\nshafts; the rotation of these shafts moves\nthe jaws in each pair taward or away from\neach other to grasp or release the workpiece (see Figure 1).\nEach jaw includes a rigid gripping pad\nlined with rubber to give it a firm grip and to\nprevent damage to the workpiece. The inner cylindrical surface (corner) of each jaw\ntapers off to flat sides. This enables the jaw\nto grasp workpieces with diameters larger\nthan or equal to twice the corner radius.\nThe range of graspable diameters could be\nincreased by making the corner radius\nvery small and the flat sides as fingers that\nmesh together when the jaws approach\neach other.\nThe counter rotating shafts are driven by\ntwo pancake-type harmonic speed reducers in series, actuated by the same motor\n(see Rgure 2).

Stopping the loss of reactor gases\ncan also be important for reasons other\nthan energy efficiency: the desired reaction product may be a gas, or the gases\nproduced may be toxic or may need to be\ncontained to prevent pollution. The improved lockhopper should also enable the\nreactor to attain the highest possible product yield with continuous processing\nwhile permitting a controllable, continuous\nflow of ash.\nThe principal components of the lockhopper have been discussed in the following NASA Tech Briefs: " Pressure-Letdown\nPlates for Coal Gasifiers" (NPO-15965),\npage 355, Vol. 8, NO.3 and "Variable Control Part for Fluidic Control Device" (NPO16603), page 114, Vol. 10, No.2. The lockhopper was designed to convert reactor\nsolids removal from batch to continuous\nflow; it should also be applicable in fluidized-bed reactor systems and in the separation of dust or other solids from gases.\nIn the improved lockhopper, the loss of\nthe reactor gas is prevented by equalization of the pressure of the control gas injected into the fluidic flow-control device\nwith the pressure in the reactor vessel.\nThis eliminates the pressure gradient at the\nash outlet of the reactor. However, the flow\nof ash continues because of gravity. In\nscale-model tests that used sand to simulate ash, the continuous flow of the sand\nwas obtained without loss of reactor pressure.\nIn the original lockhopper, a quasi-porous-plug pressure-letdown device greatly\nreduced, but did not eliminate, the loss of\ngas and the concomitant loss of heat from\nthe reactor vessel. In the improved lockhopper, the pressure-letdown device\nserves to reduce the flow of control gas required to achieve the equalization of pressures.\nThe original lockhopper used steam as\nthe control gas, but in some processes the\nintroduction of steam into the reactor vessel is not permissible or not desirable. The\nsteam was generated by injecting water into the ash-hopper outlet of the reactor. This\nquench water also caused large cinders to\ndisintegrate into fine ash that could pass\nthrough the fluidic control and pressureletdown devices. With the improved lockhopper, moving grates or other conventional mechanical methods would be used\nto break up cinders when necessary.\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\nReactor\nVessel\n\nPressure in\nFluidic Device\nEquals Pressure\nin Reactor Vessel\n\n~3.E=:;;:3 ....- - - Control Gas\nFluidic Flow\xc2\xb7Control\n\nAsh and\nControl\xc2\xb7Gas Flow\n\nCleanout\nDoor\n\nPressureLetdown\nDevice\n\nIn the Improved Continuous\xc2\xb7 Flow Ash Lockhopper, the pressure-driven loss of hot gas from\nthe reactor vessel through the ash-hopper outlet is prevented by using the control gas in the\nfluidic flow-control device to equalize the pressure in the reactor vesel.\n\nIn many applications the control gas\nmay be compressed air; in others, inert\ngases or other specific gases may be re-\n\nquired.

A memorymetal actuator is formed to a shape while\nhot, then to another shape while cold.\nWhen a cold actuator is heated so that its\ntemperature rises above a critical point, it\nsnaps from its cold shape to its hot shape.\nUpon cooling, the actuator returns to its\ncold shape, ready for another cycle. Clearly, the faster the actuator can be heated\nand cooled, the faster it can operate.\nIn an early version of a memory-metal\nactuator, actuation time was kept short by\nkeeping the actuator just below its critical\ntemperature and passing an electrical current through it for direct resistance heating. Later versions used thermoelectric\ncooling. Peltier junctions conSisting of\nmetal wires were placed on the actuators\nor on their mounting plates. However,\nmetal thermocouples are highly inefficient\nand would accomplish little more than\ntransmit heat by conduction. Semiconducting Peltier junctions are orders of magnitude more efficient, but unlike metal\nwires, they are inflexible. To allow for this\ninflexibility, a brush contact is employed.\nIn the proposed configuration, the actuator could still be heated by passing a\ncurrent through an electrical resistance.\nHowever, it could also be both cooled and\nheated thermoelectrically via a brush\nmounted on an external thermoelectric\nheating or cooling plate (Rgure 1). The flexible bristles of the brush would press\nagainst or could be permanently attached\nto the actuator, ensuring good thermal contact. Heat would flow rapidly to or from the\nactuator metal, through the bristles and\nheatinglcooling plate, from or to a heat\nsink.\nDepending on the heating and COOling\nneeds of the device, additional brushes\nand cooling elements could be placed\nalong the circumference of the actuator.\n84\n\nFigure 1.

Ceramic bearings are attractive for use in gas-turbine\nengines because ceramics generally retain their strengths and resistances to corrosion over a range of temperatures much\ngreater than that of typical steels used in\nrolling-element bearings. Furthermore, because ceramics have mass densities lower than those of steels, they might be used\nto reduce centrifugally induced stresses in\nthe outer races of high-speed bearings.\nThe text begins with a brief description\nof historical developments in the field. This\nis followed by a discussion of the effect of\ncontact stress on the fatigue life of a rolling\nelement. The discussion is supplemented\nby figures and a table that give data on the\nfatigue lives of rolling elements made of\nvarious materials.\nThe next topic is the effect of elastic and\nthermal properties.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn electrostatic sprayer has been modified so that it can apply coatings suspended or dissolved in electrically conductive\nliquids. The sprayer was developed to apply a water-base polyurethane coating to a\nwoven, shaped polyester fabric. The coating provides a pressure seal for the fabric,\nwhich is part of a spacesuit. The sprayer\nmay also be useful for applying waterproof,\ndecorative, or protective coatings to fabrics for use on Earth.\nOrdinarily, such a sprayer cannot handle water or other conductive liquids because the tip of the nozzle electrode tends\nto short-circuit; it cannot then impart a\ncharge to the particles in the atomized liquid. In the modified sprayer, the nozzle and\ngun are constructed of non conductive\nmolded plastic. The liquid passageway is\nmade long enough that electrical leakage\nthrough it is low. The coaxial hose for the\nliquid is built of a polytetrafluoroethylene\ntube, an insulating sleeve, and a polyurethane jacket.\nIn addition, the sprayer is provided with\nan insulated seal at the gun-ta-hose connection, a nonconductive airhose, a pressure tank electrically isolated from ground,\nand a special nozzle electrode. The supply\nof atomizing air is reduced so that particle\nmomentum will be controlled by the electrostatic field more effectively.\nA high-voltage cable is connected to the\nnozzle electrode in the spray head. The\npolyurethanelwater mixture passes from a\npressurized pot through the coaxial hose to\nthe nozzle. There it is atomized by the air\nsupply and charged by the negative nozzle\nelectrode so that it emerges from the gun\nas a spray of uniformly dispersed negative\nparticles. A nozzle voltage of more than\n30 kV is needed.\nThe fabric is not conductive enough to\nact as a positive electrode. It is therefore\nplaced on a metal plate shaped to conform\nwith the fabric. The electrostatic field\npasses directly through the thin fabric, setting up a force field perpendicular to the\nsurface of the grounded plate. The fabric\ninterstices thus become thoroughly filled,\nsince the charged particles try to penetrate\nthe fabric. Even irregularly shaped surfaces become smoothly and uniformly\ncoated.\n88\n\nThe CPI fitting is one oj\n\nSimple design,\nhigh quality\xe2\x80\xa2..\nThe "One and\nOnly" Parker\nsingle ferrule\nfitting for\nprocess control, power,\ninstrumentation\nand analytical\nsystems.\n\nThe simplicity of Parker\'s single ferrule design , only two metal-tometal seal points, makes the CPI fitting one of the most effective leak\ntight fittings available.\nAvailable in a wide range of configurations, materials and sizes.

It is necessary to remove them\nbecause they give rise to voids and delaminations.\nIn the conventional (non-differential-curing) manufacturing process, layers of\nwoven fibers, all impregnated by the same\nthermosetting resin (prepregs), ar~ stacked\non a mold, then covered with a release material and a bleeder cloth. The entire layup\nis then enclosed in a vacuum bag and heated in an oven or autoclave to cure the resin. The vacuum removes the volatiles that\ndiffuse out to the surface of the laminate.\nThe rate of curing of the resin increases\nwith the temperature. Because the heat of\nthe oven or autoclave is conducted into the\ncuring laminate through the bag and the\nmOld, the outer plies of the laminate are initially hotter, and therefore, can cure before\nthe middle plies do. If the outer plies on the\nbag side cure first, they can trap the volatiles inside.\nThe improved manufacturing process\nwould resemble the conventional process,\nexcept that prepregs that have been partially cured would be laid on the mold in a\nsequence in which the degree of partial\ncure decreases from the mold side to the\nbag side. The degree of partial cure of\neach layer at the time of layup can be selected by controlling the storage and partial-curing temperatures of the prepreg according to an Arrhenius equation for the\nrate of gel of the resin as a function of temperature and time from the moment of mixing. The differential advancement of the\ncure in the layers would be made large\nenough to offset the effect of advance bagside heating in the oven or autoclave.Thus,\nthe inner layers would cure before the out:\ner layers, allowing the volatiles to escape.\nIn an alternative version of the process,\nthe prepregs would be uncured or partially\ncured to the same degree and kept in cold\nstorage. One prepreg would be taken from\nstorage, placed on the mold, and heated to\na moderate temperature for a short time to\nobtain a partial cure. Another prepreg\n89\n\nwould then be taken from storage, placed\non the first prepreg, and the resulting layup\nheated again to cure the first layer further\nand begin the cure of the second layer. This\nprocess would be repeated until all the\nlayers are in place. The laminate would\n\nthen be vacuum-bagged and autoclaved to\ncomplete the cure.\nThis work was done by Charles N.\nWebster of LTV Miss/es and Electronics\nGroup for Johnson Space Center.

The technique should enable the\nfabrication of lightweight mirrors of high\nsurface finish suitable for use at short\nwavelengths: Heretofore, the irreducible\nsmall-scale roughness of the surfaces due\nto the structures of composite materials in\xc2\xb7\nhibited the use of composite mirrors at\nshort wavelengths.\nThe technique (see figure) resembles\nthat used to make lightweight replica mirrors and gratings. A layer of parting material is deposited on a master optical surface\nof the precise desired shape. This parting\nlayer must be very thin to minimize degradation of the replica.\nBy ion\xc2\xb7assisted evaporation or another\nestablished method, a shell of mirror or\nmirror-supporting material is deposited on\nthe parting layer. The shell could be made\nof Si02 , SiN, HfN, or other hard material.\nThe thickness of the shell is made large\nenough - typically between a few microns and 1 mm - to give the shell significant rigidity of its own and to withstand\nhandling and abrasion.\nNext, a layer of adhesive much thinner\nthan the shell is used to attach the mirror\nshell to a graphite-composite substrate,\nthe surface of which approximates the desired mirror surface. When the adhesive\nhas cured, the substrate and shell are separated from the master at the parting layer.\nThe resulting mirror has nearly the high optical quality of the master.\nThis work was done by Aden B.

The film be90\n\ncomes superconductive below a transition\ntemperature (fJ of 93 K.\nPrevious experiments had shown that\nafter specimens of Y/BalCu/O were reacted at temperatures greater than 950 "C\n\nbut for relatively short times, they had\nsharper Tc transitions. This observation\ngave rise to the hypothesis that an extremely careful heat treatment is necessary because the formation of the\nsemiconducting "211" phase is thermodynamically favored CNer the formation of the\nsuperconducting "123" phase. The new\nfabrication process takes account of this\nhypothesis by incorporating suitable heat\ntreatments.\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\nIn the experiment, preparation of the\nsemiconducting substrate material was\nbegun by grinding appropriate amounts of\nmetal oxides, pressing them into pellets,\nthen heating them to 950 OC for 12 h to\nform the "211 " phase. To assure complete\nreaction , the pellets were reground,\npressed into pellets again, and reheated.\nThe superconducting material to be deposited on the substrate was prepared by\nmixing the appropriate amounts of metal\noxides to form YBaPJ:P7\' pressing them\ninto pellets, heating at 950 OC for 12 h, then\nquenching to room temperature.

The\nsystem was conceived to meet the need\nfor increased precision of angular measurements in advanced scientific instruments.\nAt present, the most-precise angular-encoder disks are made on mechanical angl~ividing machines. Small increases in\nthe precision of such machines are expensive and consume much time. The proposed system would abandon the traditional mechanical-precision approach, relying\ninstead on a combination of the high precision of electronic time division and digital\nsynthesis of frequency with the almostfriction-free motion of a rotor suspended in\na high vacuum by electrostatic forces.\nAs shown schematically in the figure,\nthe disk to be engraved would be mounted\non the lONer end of a short cylindrical rotor\nsuspended electrostatically and would\nserve as the lower-end rotor electrode.\nVoltages applied to all the electrodes of the\nelectrostatic suspension system would be\ndetermined by a feedback control subsystem that would sense the various capacitances between the end and side rotor and\nstator electrodes.

Focused laser beams would mark this surface by evaporating the metal at the designated spots.

For\nequal angular increments, the lasers\nwould be pulsed periodically, at intervals of\nthe fraction of the period of rotation corresponding to the desired increment of angie.\nA co rotating (but normally mechanically-separate) transparent disk below the\ndisk to be engraved would collect the evaporated metal so that it does not accumulate on the laser{)eam windows, where it\nwould otherwise subsequently attenuate\nthe laser beams. To bring the rotor up to\nthe desired rate of rotation, the corotating\n\ndisk would initially be connected to the\nrotor via a piezoelectric or electromagnetic clutch, which would disengage when\nthe rotor attains the desired speed.\nThe pressure of the metal vapor and the\nelectric field in the interelectrode gaps\nmust be kept below the levels that would\ntrigger electrical arcs. Preferably, the\nvoltages applied to the top and side electrodes would be balanced in such a way\nthat the electric field at the bottom disk\ncould be zero.

The slots enable a moreuniform low-work function coating to be\ndispensed to the electron-emitting surface.\nThe emission of electrons therefore becomes more uniform over the cathode surface.\nA molybdenum mandrel is coated by\nchemical-vapor deposition with a layer of\ntungsten 25 IA\'Tl thick, followed by a layer of\naluminum 5 ~ thick. A layer of photoresist\n1 ~ thick is applied over the aluminum.\nSlots are cut in the photoreSist by writing\nwith a laser beam, electron beam, or ion\nbeam, exposing parts of the underlying aluminum film (see Figure 1). The aluminum\nunder the slots is etched away by chemically-assisted ion{)eam etching, a process\nin which chlorine gas and a beam of xenon\nions are directed into the slots in the photoresist (see Figure 2). The beam of ions enhances the chemical reactivity of the aluminum with the chlorine, forming a volatile\nproduct that is pumped away. The resulting\npattern of slots in the aluminum, which is\nidentical to the pattern in the photoresist,\nexposes the underlying tungsten.\nAnother chemically-assisted ion{)eam\netching step follows.

Earlier methods resulted in\nas many as 107 pinholes per square centi\xc2\xb7\nmeter. The absence of pinholes is critical to\nthe operation of multilayer devices employ\xc2\xb7\ning CoSi2 layers, such as the metal base\ntransistor.\nIn the new method, cobalt and silicon are\nevaporated from electron-beam sources\nonto a substrate of silicon having a <111>\ncrystal orientation. The materials are deposited in the stoichiometric ratio of two silo\nicon atoms to one of cobalt, yielding a\nsingle~rystal CoSi 2 film 5 to 10 nm thick. A\nlayer of amorphous silicon 1 to 2 nm thick\nis deposited on the CoSi z The specimen is\nthen annealed at 550 "C for 10 min.\nThe amorphous\xc2\xb7silicon cap prevents\npinholes from forming during annealing. In\nthe absence of this cap, apparently the\nhigh surface energy of CoSi 2 relative to Si\ncauses the formation of pinholes, which expose the underlying Si surface and thereby\nreduce the total energy of the epitaxial\nsystem at temperatures above 500 "C. The\nsilicon cap appears to reduce the total surface energy without the formation of pinholes. In fact, the temperature can be\nraised as high as 600 \xc2\xb0C with the cap.\nBecause the CoSi 2 1ayer is stoichiometric, it does not consume the cap during annealing. Thus, the cap remains during the\nentire annealing process and is available to\n\nseNe as a template for further deposits of\nsilicon during later processing.\nScanning electron microscopy and other\ntechniques were used to evaluate the qualityof the CoSi2 films on both sil i con~pped\nand uncapped substrates. The films were\netched with carbon tetrafluoride plasma to\nenlarge pinholes for greater visibility;\nwhere a silicon cap layer covered a pinhole, it, too, was removed by the plasma.\nThis procedure improved the detection\nresolution to 1,000 pinholes per square\ncentimeter. No pinholes could be found on\nthe capped film, whereas the uncapped\nfilm was riddled with pinholes (see figure).\nThis work was done by True-Lon Un,\nRobert N. Fathauer, and Paula J.

In the new fluidized bed, the\nsilicon seed particles are heated in the uppermost zone of the reactor. The hot particles gradually mix with the lower particles\nand descend through the fluidized bed. The\nlower wall of the vessel is kept relatively\ncool. Because silane that enters at the bottom and circulates through the reactor is\npyrolized to silicon at high temperatures,\nsilicon is therefore deposited on the particles in preference to the wall.\nA typical previous fluidized bed, in contrast, was heated through the wall. Therefore, the wall was hotter than the reaction\nzone, and silicon was deposited on the wall\nas well as on the bed particles, reducing\nthe net yield of silicon and creating a cleanup problem. Moreover, the high temperature in the lower layers of the bed favored\nthe formation of fine silicon dust that had to\nbe separated from the product particles\nand recovered.\nIn the new process, silicon seed particles are introduced into the base of the reactor vessel (see figure), where a stream of\ninert gas creates a fluidized bed of the particles extending almost to the top of the\nvessel. At the top of the bed, immersion\nheaters encased in quartz and wall heaters\nmaintain a temperature of 650 to 800 \xc2\xb0C.\nThe turbulence of the bed mixes hot seed\nparticles from the heating zone with particles in lower layers, the net result being a\nvertical gradient of temperature ranging\ndown to 450 to 650 \xc2\xb0C at the bottom of the\nbed. Wall heaters add only enough heat to\nmake up for losses.\nSilane flowing up from the base of the\nvessel decomposes in the reaction zone\njust below the heating zone, deposITing silicon on the silicon seed particles but not on\nthe wall. Essentially all the silane reacts in\nthe reaction zone; it does not flow into the\nheating zone. Once a particle has grown to\na size of 400 to 1,500 J.d11, the particle descends from the reaction zone through a\nseparator to a collector.\nSilane enters the vessel through a perforated distributor cone at the bottom.\nWater circulating in a coil around the distributor cone keeps it at a temperature of\nabout 300 \xc2\xb0C - low enough to suppress\nthe deposition of silicon dust even though\nthe silane is highly concentrated at this\npoint in the reactor.\nIn a demonstration of the process,\nabout 8 kW of power were supplied to the\ntop 15 in.

However, because CrSi 2 is a semiconductor\nwith a band gap of 0.3 eY, the experimental\nprocess has potential for the monolithic integration of microelectronic devices based\non CrSi 2 (e.g., infrared detectors) with signal-processing circuitry based on Si.\nIn the experiments, Si(111) wafers were\nfirst cleaned chemically by a process that\nleaves a protective oxide on the surface.\nThe wafers were then placed in a commercia\x01 molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) apparatus, where the oxide was removed by\na beam of Si in some cases or by thermal\ndesorption in other cases.\nThe apparatus was equipped with separate electron-beam evaporators, one for Si\nand one for Cr. Each CrSi 2 specimen was\ngrown by one of four techniques, each of\nwhich is a special case of generic MBE. In\nthe first technique , called "solid-phase\n\nreactive epitaxy" (SRE), Cr was deposited\non a subtrate of Si held at room temperature; the substrate and deposit were then\nannealed at a temperature of 580, 650, or\n720\xc2\xb0C. In the second technique, called\n"reactive-deposition epitaxy" (ROE), Cr\nwas deposited on a hot Si substrate. The\nthird technique, called "solid-phase\nepitaxy" (SPE), involved the stoichiometric\ndeposition of Cr and Si at room temperature, followed by annealing at higher temperature. In the fourth technique, denoted\nby the generic term "MBE," Cr and Si were\ncodeposited stoichiometrically on a hot Si\nsubstrate.\nCrSi 2 layers were grown to thicknesses\nof 10 and 210 nm (see figures). The specimens were monitored during growth by reflection high-energy electron diffraction\n(RHEED). After removal from the MBE apparatus, the specimens were analyzed by\nscann ing electron microscopy (SEM),\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM),\nand Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy(RSS).\n\nThe analyses showed that the CrSi 2\nlayers tended to form islands, within each\nof which one of several crystalline orientations prevailed. The two most common orientations observed_were C!Sii0001)1I\nSi(111) with CrSi~1010]/Si1101] ant! CrSi 2\n(OOO1}1Si(111) with CrSi~1120]/Si[101]. The\ntwo orientations differ in that the CrSi 2\nlayers are rotated about 30\xc2\xb0 with respect\nto each other about the perpendicular to\nthe surface. For the thick layers, the MBE\ntechnique yielded the largest grains and\nbest RHEED pattern. The sizes of the\ngrains were found to increase with temperature: grains 1 to 2 J.IfTl across were 0bserved in a layer deposited at 825 OC.\nThis work was done by Robert W\nFathauer, Paula J.

It is placed on the graph and used to\ninterpolate the coordinate value of a point\non a curve or a plotted point on a figure\nwithin a division on each coordinate axis.\nA typical construction and use of the\nCVVS are shown in the figure. A baseline\nPO is constructed of arbitrary length, but it\nshould be about 10 times the distance to be\ninterpolated. Next, the scale line OR is constructed perpendicular to PO. For convenience, OR may be equal in length to PO.\nThen, 10 equally spaced divisions are\nmarked off on the scale line OR, and\nstraight lines are drawn from P\n.\nThe CVVS is overlaid on a plotted curve\nas shown so that the two legs of the triangle, PO and PR, span the division on the x\naxis that includes the projected intercept\nx(a) of point (a). Note that this intercept falls\nbetween lines 4 and 5 of the geometric\noverlay. Therefore, x(a) can be more closely estimated as 2.49 instead of 2.5. If the\nscale is then rotated by goo and the above\nprocedure is repeated for the appropriate\ndivision on the y axis, the y coordinate, y(a),\nis more closely estimated as 2.76 instead\nof 2.8. To make it easier to line up the baseline with a coordinate axis and with the line\nthat projects the point to one of the axes,\nfaint lines can be drawn parallel to both\naxes.\nThe CVVS can also be used to interpolate a logarithmic scale if a logarithmic\nscale is constructed on the scale line. It\ncan also be used to change the scale of a\nfigure by changing the scale of the coordinate axes on that figure.\n\n.-----------------------------------------------~\nQ\nR\n\no\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n678\n\n9\n\n10\n\n4\n\n3\ny(a)\n\ny\n\n2\n\nThe CVVS In This case Is used to read the x and y coordinates of point (a) more precisely as\n2.49 and 2.76, respectively.\n\nFor durability and clarity, the CVVS can\nbe constructed on thin, clear, plastic material. It is a simple, inexpensive device that\ncan readily meet the needs of scientists\nand technologists in making better estimates of points on plotted figures that are\npublished in the literature.

It is a very\nflexible device that can be constructed\nwith any kind of scale. It is very easy to use,\nrequiring no special equipment of any kind,\n\nand can save a considerable amount of\ntime if numerous points are to be evaluated.\nThis work was done by Irvin M.

Refer to LAR-13721.\n\nSome Protocols for Optical -Fiber Digital Communications\nOne works best in heavy traffic; another, in light traffic.\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThree protocols have been proposed for\ndigital communications among stations\n98\n\nconnected by passive taps to a pair of unidirectional optical-fiber buses. The proto-\n\ncols mediate round-robin, bounded-<lelay\naccess to the buses by all stations and are\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\nparticularly suited to fast transmission.\nPartly because the transmission medium is\npassive (there are no relay stations) and\npartly because the protocols distribute the\ncontrol of the network among all stations\nwith provision for the addition and deletion\nof stations (there are no control stations),\nthe communication network should be\nable to resist and recover from failures.\nThe signals on the two buses travel in\nopposite directions. Each station includes\na transmitter and receiver connected to\nboth buses (see figure). When the receiver\ndetects a carrier signal, it attempts to synchronize itself to the bits in the preamble of\nthe incoming signal and to copy the signal\ninto the memory of the station. Provided\nthat the receiver detects no signal coming\nfrom upstream and/or has been granted\naccess by the protocol, the transmitter\nsends a preamble followed by a packet of\ndata. There is a delay between the time a\nstation senses the end of a carrier on a bus\nand the time when it can start transmitting\non the same bus. There is an equal delay\nbetween the sensing of a carrier coming\nfrom upstream and the interruption of a\ntransmission. These functions are common to all unidirectional-bus systems but\nare managed in different ways by different\nprotocols.\nThe first of these three protocols, called\n"U-Net," defines a procedure to determine\nwhich two stations are at the right and left\nends of the bus and which should transmit\na special sequence of bits called the\n"token." The network then operates in\ncycles that are initiated when the left-end\nor right-end station transmits the token.\nEach station downstream from the initiating end station waits for the token and\nany appended packets of data to pass by,\n\nTerm ination of\nBus (Absorber)\n\nT: Transmitting Tap\nR: Receiving Tap\nRlght-to-left Bus\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nleft-to-Rlght Bus\n\nTraffic on the Twin Unidirectional Buses is managed by any of three protocols described In\nthe text. Each has advantages and disadvantages, depending on the level of traffic and the\nnumber of stations attempting to transmit.\n\nthen transmits its own packet (if any). Thus,\neach station has an opportunity to add a\npacket of data to a train of packets headed\nby the token.\nWhen traffic is light or only one station\nhas data to send, the U-Net protocol\nwastes time by forCing the transmitting station to wait for the token and then to\ntransmit only one packet at each pass. This\ndisadvantage is overcome by a hybrid protocol that enforces a random-access\nmode when traffic is light or a single station\nis transmitting and reverts to an implicittoken mode when multiple-source traffic\nbuilds up. This protocol is called " BuzzNet" because of a buzzing signal that any\nstation transmits to synchronize the network and drive it to the token mode under\ncertain conditions of increasing traffic.\nWhile the Buzz-Net protocol is efficient\nat low traffic, it is less efficient than the\nU-Net protocol is at high traffic, where it\n\nwastes time by repeatedly switching between the two modes. The "Token-less"\nprotocol was introduced to obtain efficiency at high traffic, to reduce waiting at low\ntraffic, and to eliminate special token-initialization procedures. As the name implies,\nthis protocol does not involve an explicit\ntoken. Instead, it supports a round-robin\naccess mode like that of U-Net, and the\nsynchronizing event (implicit token) is the\ncessation of activity on one of the buses.\nThe impliCit token propagates in one direction on one bus and in the opposite direction on the other bus, thus minimizing the\ninterval of silence between the end of one\nround and the beginning of the next.\nThis work was done by Cavour Yeh and\nMario Gerla of the University of California\nfor NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor further information, Circle 133 on the\nTSP Request Card.\nNPO-17333\n\nAlgorithm for Optimal Control of Large Structures\nThe cost of computation appears competitive with that of other methods.\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nAll iterative algorithm has been derived\nfor the numerical computation of optimal\ncontrol of a linear system (e.g., a large,\nvibrating structure) of many degrees of\nfreedom . The cost of the algorithm, as\nmeasured in terms of the number of computations required, is of the order of, or less\nthan, the cost of prior algorithms applied to\nsimilar problems.\nThe problem is to compute the optimal\ncontrol of forced response of a structure\nwith n degrees of freedom that is identified\nin terms of a smaller number, r, of vibrational modes. The article begins with the\nHamilton-Jacobi formulation of mechanics\nand the use of a quadratic cost functional.\nWhile the Hamilton-Jacobi approach has\npreviously resulted in computational complexity that increased almost exponentially\nwith n, the complexity can be reduced by\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1989\n\nan alternative approach in which the\nquadratic cost functional is expressed in\nterms of the control variables only. This\nleads to the iterative solution of a secondorder time-integral matrix Volterra equation of the second kind that contains the\noptimal control vector.\nAt each iteration, the matrix Volterra equation is integrated numerically by use of a\ntrapezoidal integration scheme in which\nthe control interval is discretized into s\nequally spaced intervals of time. The particular structure of the matrices can be exploited to reduce the number of computations and to enable the use of a Jacobi-type\niterative solution. Some steps are common\nto all iterations and thus need to be executed only once.\nOverall, the total number of computations required is of the order of\n\n[4r(q max + r) ms + n 2 ]\n\nwhere m is the number of control variables\nand qmax is the number of iterations required for convergence. Although qmax is\nnot known a priori, the dominance of diagonal terms in one of the matrices at an intermediate step of the derivation suggests\nthat qmax should be of the order of 10. As a\nresult, the algorithm appears to be competitive with other methods based on solutions\nto matrix Riccati equations, especially at\nlarge n.\nThis work was done by Moktar A.\nSalama and John A.

NPO-16983\n99\n\nIdeal Resampling of Discrete Sequences\nSpectral information is preserved to the extent possible.\nAmes Research Center, Moffett Field, California\nA technique has been developed to\nshrink or expand a discrete input sequence\nof numbers into an output sequence in a\nmanner that preserves the input spectrum\nup to the Nyquist limit of the smaller of the\ntwo sequences. In the case of expansion,\nthe technique also prevents the introduc\xc2\xb7\ntion of spurious frequencies not present in\nthe input. While the technique is applicable\nto many kirds of data sampled at regular\nintervals, it is particularly useful in the processing ard enhancement of images, where\nthe discrete sequences are spatially ordered sets of picture-element brightness\nvalues.\nThe problem is to change the input sequence of N numbers to an output sequence of M numbers. The first step of the\nsolution is to take the discrete Fourier\ntransform (OFl) of the input. The OFT is\nused to reconstruct a continuous, bandlimited function containing the same spectrum as that of the input sequence. This is\nthe function that one \'NOuld observe upon\nlow-pass filtering an input signal below the\nNyquist frequency of the sequence (and\ntaking half the amplitude at the Nyquist frequency) and is the function that yields the\ninput sequence when sampled at the input\ntimes or positions.\nThe continuous function is low-pass filtered to eliminate frequencies (if any)\nabove the Nyquist rate of an M-sample sequence. This can be done in the frequency\ndomain by taking the product of the OFT\nand the filter frequency dependence, or in\nthe time or space domain by convolution\nwith a sinc function of frequency M. In the\ntime or space domain, the filtered signal\ncan be converted to the output sequence\nby sampling it at intervals of 11M. Alter\xc2\xb7\nnatively, the filtered OFT can be convolved\nwith a pulse-train OFT, then inverted to the\ntime or space domain to yield the output\nsequence.\nA two-dimensional array of numbers\n(e.g., image data) is treated by applying the\ntechnique to the two-dimensional OFT\'s of\nthe rows and columns of picture elements.\nSimilarly, third-order and higher-order arrays are treated via the applicable multidimensional OFT\'s. The technique might be\nused, for example, to expand an image array, increasing the number of picture elements to smooth out the grainy awearance\nof a few large picture elements. A1tematively, it might be used to decrease the\nnumber of picture elements (see figure).\nIf the third dimension of a three-dimensional array is time, the technique could be\napplied to create a slow-motion image sequence without the difficulty of recording\n100\n\n:~\n\nf;~\n\n",\'\n\n,~\n\n~1i:\n\n~~ . ~"" I.,,,\' ,.\'L .-;.\n\n.~\n\n...;\n\n-\n\n:\n\nr rf~\n,~:\n\nI\'\n\n"\n\nDiscrete Fourier Transform\n\nImage\n\n,\n\nI\'\n\',-\n\nI......\n\nHorlzontal\xc2\xb7Frequency\xc2\xb7\nFiltered Transform\n\nHorizontally Trimmed\nTransform\n\nHorizontally and Vertically\nTrimmed Transform\n\nCoarsened\nImage\n\nVertlcal\xc2\xb7FrequencyFiltered Transform\n\nAn Image Is Coarsened by resampling to reduce the number of picture elements while preserving as much as possible of the original image Information.\n\nrapidly, then playing back at low speed.

The main objective of a control law is to enable a plant to\ntrack a desired or commanded trajectory\nselected from a given class of trajectories\nas closely as possible in the presence of\nrandom and deterministic disturbances\nand despite uncertainties about the plant.\nThe feedforward controller tries to track\nthe desired or commanded trajectory,\nwhereas the feedback controller tries to\nmaintain the state of the plant near the desired trajectory. Modern control theory has\nconcentrated more attention on the important feedback control problem, while\nthe feedforward control problem has received less attention.\nIn the methodology for combined stochastic feedforward/feedback control, the\nmain cbjectives of the feedforward and feedback control laws are seen clearty. The inclusion of error-integral feedback, dynamic compensation , rate-command control\nstructure, and the like is an integral element of the methodology. Another advan-\n\ntage of the methodology is the flexibility to\ndevelop a variety of techniques for the design of feedback control with arbitrary\nstructures to obtain the feedback controller: These include stochastic output feedback, multiconfiguration control , decentralized control, or frequency and classical\ncontrol methods.\nA specific incremental implementation\nis recommended for the combined feedforward/feedback controller. Some advantages of this digital implementation are\nsimplicity, elimination of the need for trim\nvalues, and avoidance of such problems\nas integrator windup. The closed-loop\neigenvalues obtained in this implementation contain the designed closed-loop\neigenvalues that would result if an incremental implementation were not used.\nIt has been shown that when using an incremental implementation, it is advantageous to design the controller with as\nmany integrators as the number of controls.

One\nwould include expert subsystems that\ncould be used in planning and conducting\nwind-tunnel tests; for advice and training in\nthe understanding of the characteristics of\nwind tunnels, measuring instruments, and\nancillary equipment; and to assist in setting up tests to meet various objectives\nand requirements.\nThis system \'NOUld include what amounts\nto an interactive electronic instruction\nmanual similar to some te\'<tual-information\nsystems that are already commercially\navailable. A pretest-intelligent-assistant\nsubsystem would help engineers in the\ndesign of models and selection of instrumentation. A prototype subsystem to aid in\nthe selection of strain-gauge balances to\nbe inserted in models is described in an appendix. One subsystem would incorporate\ncomputational fluid dynamics to help in\nplanning tests. Other subsystems include\none to assess the quality of data during and\nafter tests, one to correct for the effects of\nthe walls of wind tunnels on experimental\ndata, and one for training.\nThe second major artificial-intelligence\nsystem would guide the diagnosis, monitoring, and repair of equipment. By duplicating established techniques used by experienced technicians, one subsystem\ncould spot emerging trouble early, thereby\nincreasing productivity by preventing unnecessary damage and unnecessary repetition of tests. One subsystem would\nmon~or sensors during tests for signs of\nmalfunctions. Another subsystem would\nmonitor wind-tunnel machinery.\nThe third major artifiCial-intelligence\nsystem would be an interactive system for\nthe management of the data base of multiyear test statistics. This system would be\nused to improve schedules of operation\nand maintenance of tunnels and other\nequipment, the aSSignment of personnel,\nthe distribution of electrical power, and the\nanalysis of costs and productMty.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA self-contained seed-sprouting system provides an environment for sprouting\nseeds quickly and easily. Developed as a\nsource of fresh vegetable material on short\nSpace Shuttle flights, the kit offers advantages to home gardeners too. Apartment\ndwellers could use it for steady production\nof homegrown sprouts even though they\nhave no garden space.\nThe system gives seeds all they need to\nsprout: water, good drainage, and plenty of\nair. Ught, soil, and the containers for CUltivating whole plants are unnecessary.\nSeeds of various vegetables and field\ncrops can be stored dry indefinitely, then\nplaced in the system when needed. The\nseeds quickly grow five to seven times in\nweight and turn into what are essentially\ngreen vegetables. The vitamin contents Increase dramatically, as do fiber contents.\nFat and carbohydrate contents drop, while\nlittle protein is lost. Many of the inhibitors\nand toxicants of raw seeds are eliminated\nor reduced significantly.\nThe sprouting container Is the standard\n6-oz (O.1B-L) package for dehydrated food\nand drink mixes in the Space Shuttle.\n.About 4 g of dry alfalfa or radish seeds are\nvacuum-sealed in each cup, like freezedried foods. Sixteen cups are suspended in\na tray (see figure). An alr-and-water inlet\ntube links each cup to a system of tubes\nand solenoid valves that alternately fumish\nair and water and remove stale air. A\nperistaltic pump supplies water from a\nvinyl medical-fluid bag. A small diaphragm\npump supplies and exhausts air. A small\ncircuit board times the movements of the\nair and water.\nThe proper growth of sprouts, both on\nEarth and in the microgravity of outer\nspace, depends on adequate aeration and\njust the right amount of water. In microgravity,the effect of excess water is magnified in that water clings to the germinating\nseeds through surface tenSion, impeding\nmovement of oxygen to the seeds. To prevent the sprouts from drowning in this way,\nthe system adds water at frequent intervals, providing only the moisture needed\nfor immediate uptake and for the expansion of the sprouts during each interval.\nThe kit also periodically deflates and rein106\n\nfiates the sealed cups to remove gaseous\nmetabolic products and to supply fresh oxygen.\nThis \'WOrk was done by Richard L Sauer\nof Johnson Space Center and H.

The three-dimensional simulation will help medical researchers to\nbetter understand the heart \'s complex flow field and should lead to improved pump designs .\n" Many of the present problems\nwith artificial hearts are directly attributable to the fluid dynamics of the\nblood flow ," said Dr. Stuart Rogers ,\nan Ames research scientist . Embedded regions of turbulent flow can\ndamage the red blood cells, he explained, while flow trapped in corners\nof the heart can breed clots that\ncause strokes.\n"With increased knowledge of the\nfluid behavior," said Dr. Paul Kutler,\nChief of Ames \' Fluid Dynamics Division, " artificial heart manufacturers\nwill be able to suggest configuration\nchanges to improve the flow quality."\nThe NASA model applies a simulation technique called computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) . Originally\ndeveloped to track fluid motion in side components of the Space\nShuttle main engine, CFD involves\nthe solution on supercomputers of\ncomplicated mathematical equations\ndescribing flow behavior. CFD solutions are " information rich ," Kutler\nsaid , and offer the design engineer a\ncomplete picture of the given flow\nfield. Moreover, geometry changes\nare performed easily in the computer,\nsaving time and money in the design\nprocess.\nAmes SCientists, building on an\nexisting 3D flow code used in\naerospace and automotive research ,\ncreated a time-accurate algorithm to\npredict the unsteady flow path and\nconstructed geometry definition and\ngrid generation packages that emulate the mechanical heart\'s pumping\nmotion. Although the simulation of a\nsingle heartbeat requires four hours\nof data processing on a Cray 2 supercomputer, it provides otherwise unobtainable information . Kutler\'s\ngroup is working to speed up the\n\n"\'U\n:J\n\n\xc2\xa7\nn\n\no\n\n"\n\'"\na;\n\n\'<\n\nZ\n~ ~________________________________________________________________________J\n\xc2\xbb\n\nrn\n\nThis simulation shows vorticity magnitude contours on the inside surface of\nthe heart chamber. The fluid, a waterglycerin solution used by experimentors\nto represent blood, is being pumped out\nthrough the open valve by a piston.\n\ncalculations by refining the\nalgorithm .\nThe CFD tool, now used to recreate\nthe incompressible flow through one\nchamber of a Pennsylvania State artificial heart, may be applied to\nseveral other experimental heart designs. Potentially the biggest benefit\nis in development of the total artificial heart scheduled for clinical\ntesting in the early 1990\'s.\nAmes researchers next plan to\nsimulate the flow surrounding the\nvalve openings in the Penn State\nmodel. " By combining the valve calculations with our present work on\nthe heart chamber," explained Dr.\nDochan Kwak, an Ames scientist ,\n" we \'ll have a complete flow analysis\npackage for artificial heart manufacturers. "\n\n" This code was written for completely generalized coordinates, "\nsaid Dr. Rogers, " so it can easily be\ntaken from one problem and put onto another. "\nDevelopers of the Penn State heart\nare applying the CFD technology\npioneered to date to analyze blood\nflow behavior and compare it with\ntheir experimental observations. The\nsimulation is a first step, Rogers said ,\ntowards computer-aided design of\nmechanical hearts. D\n\n"Spin back" Potential\nNASA\'s loan of space technology\nto this research project-which\ninvolves the Ames Center, Pennsylvania State University, and Stan ford University-will be repaid with\ninterest, according to Kutler, who anticipates " spinback" applications of\nthe enhanced code by NASA and the\naerospace community . " It \'s useful\nanywhere you have unsteady flows\nwith moving boundaries," he said ,\n" such as inside a jet engine. "\nNASA hopes to use the code to\nmodel flow in the shuttle engine\'s\nfuel and oxidizer pumps, while the\nNavy wants to apply it to study the\nflow field around submarine propellers.\n\n"\no\n:J\n\no\n\ng\n\n~\n~\n\nj\n\n~\n~.\n\n*\nrn\n\nAn electromechanical device powered\nby inductance from an external battery,\nthe Penn State artificial heart features\na cylindrical chamber with two openings\non the side for valves.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, ISSN 0145\xc2\xb7319X , USPS 7SO.o70 ,c opyrlght @1989In U.S.,i spubli shed monthly by Assocl aled Bus iness Publications Co., Ltd . 41 E. 42nd St., New York, NY 10017\xc2\xb75391 .
