Descriptions of the fluid flow phenomena are presented along with an indication of the trends obtained from experimental investigations. In particular, three problem areas are reviewed: (1) the performance losses sustained by a VSTOL aircraft hovering out-of-ground effect, (2) the induced aerodynamic effects encountered as a VSTOL aircraft flies on the combination of powered and aerodynamic lifts between hover and cruise out-of-ground effect, and (3) the aerodynamic characteristics caused by deflected thrust during maneuvering flight over a wide range of both angle of attack and Mach number.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880004706, "id": "3638ebcfbe4d4f14a0ee0583548df7eb", "publicationDate": "1987-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880004706.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880004706/downloads/19880004706.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880004706/downloads/19880004706.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880004706/downloads/19880004706.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
