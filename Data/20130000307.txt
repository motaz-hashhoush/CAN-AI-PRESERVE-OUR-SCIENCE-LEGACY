The major contributor to the overall\nnoise of an open rotor system is the propulsor noise, which is\nproduced as a result of the interaction of the airstream with the\ncounter-rotating blades. As such, robust aeroacoustic\nprediction methods are an essential ingredient in any approach\nto designing low-noise open rotor systems. To that end, an\neffort has been underway at NASA to assess current open\nrotor noise prediction tools and develop new capabilities.\nUnder this effort, high-fidelity aerodynamic simulations of a\nbenchmark open rotor blade set were carried out and used to\nmake noise predictions via existing NASA open rotor noise\nprediction codes. The results have been compared with the\naerodynamic and acoustic data that were acquired for this\nbenchmark open rotor blade set. The emphasis of this paper is\non providing a summary of recent results from a NASA Glenn\neffort to validate an in-house open noise prediction code called\nLINPROP which is based on a high-blade-count asymptotic\napproximation to the Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings Equation.\nThe results suggest that while predicting the absolute levels\nmay be difficult, the noise trends are reasonably well predicted\nby this approach.\n\n[-] surface unit normal vector\n\np\xe2\x80\xb2( x , t )\n\nAbstract\n\n[-] Dirac delta function\n\n[m2] rotor blade surface\n\nNomenclature\n\n\xce\xba\n\n[-] convective amplitude factor\n\n\xcf\x810\n\n[kg/m3] ambient air density\n\nAi , Ai \xe2\x80\xb2\n\n[-] Airy function and its derivative\n\n\xcf\x84\n\n[s] source (i.e., retarded) time\n\nB\n\n[-] rotor blade count\n\n\xce\xa6\n\n[rad] rotor phase function\n\nc0\n\n[m/s] ambient speed of sound\n\n\xcf\x95, \xcf\x95 s\n\nej\n\n[-] unit vector component in the radiation direction\n\nfj\n\n[N/m2] blade force per unit area\n\n\xce\xa8\n\xe2\x84\xa6\n\n[rad] observer and source azimuthal angle\ncoordinates\n[rad] convective phase factor\n[rad/s] rotor angular speed\n\nG\n\n[1/m-s] free-space, moving-medium Green\xe2\x80\x99s\nfunction\n\nSubscripts:\n\ngc\n\n[-] convective phase factor\n\nM 0R\n\n[-] medium Mach number in the radiation direction\n\nM tip\n\n[-] rotor tip rotational Mach number\n\nN\n\n[rev/s] rotational speed\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217740\n\n1, 2\nj\n\nprincipal coordinate directions\n\ns\n\ntypical source point\n\n\xef\x81\x94\n\xef\x81\x8c\n\n1\n\nfront and aft rotor indices\n\nthickness noise designator\nloading noise designator\n\nIntroduction\nOpen rotors are inherently more fuel-efficient than fans due\nto their very high propulsive efficiency. With the rising fuel\ncost and the increasing restrictions on carbon emissions (CO2\nemissions are directly related to fuel burn) there is renewed\ninterest in developing open rotor systems for commercial\naviation applications.\nThe fuel burn advantage of open rotor propulsion systems\nwas convincingly demonstrated in the past (for example, in the\nlate 1980s and early 1990s as part of a NASA effort called the\nAdvanced Turboprop Project (Ref. 1)). A model scale open\nrotor developed by NASA and General Electric (GE) under\nthat project and the subsequent engine demonstrator developed\nby GE, called the unducted fan (UDF), are shown in Figure 1.\nAt that time, some of the fuel burn margin of UDF was traded\noff in order to meet the noise regulations of the time. Changes\nto the design paradigm (e.g., blade count increase and tip\nspeed reduction) and the advent of the high-fidelity threedimensional aerodynamic simulation tools have now made it\npossible to design open rotor systems that can meet the current\nnoise regulations (which are more stringent than the 1990s\nrules) without giving up any of their fuel burn advantage.\nAs a result, both the United States and Europe have been\npursuing the development of the next generation open rotor\npropulsion systems. In particular, in the U.S., a joint effort\nbetween NASA and GE Aviation was initiated to investigate\nthe aerodynamic and acoustic performance of modern blade\ndesigns. An important element of this effort has been the\nassessment of existing tools for predicting the aerodynamic\nand acoustic performance of open rotors. For that purpose a\nbaseline, vintage 1990s, blade design called the historical\nblade set (also known as F31/A31) was selected for evaluating\nvarious prediction tools. F31/A31 has 12 front rotor blades\nand 10 aft rotor blades.\nComprehensive aerodynamic, flowfield, and acoustic data\nsets were acquired in the NASA wind tunnels for a ~0.65 m\ndiameter sub-scale model of this blade set. The test campaign\nincluded both low speed testing in the NASA 9- by 15-foot\n(i.e., 2.7 by 4.6 m) wind tunnel to investigate the aero/acoustic\nperformance at operating conditions in the approach to takeoff range as well as high speed testing in the NASA 8- by 6foot (i.e., 2.4 by 1.8 m) wind tunnel to analyse the\naerodynamic performance in the speed range between climb\nand cruise conditions (Ref. 2). Data was acquired in an uninstalled configuration, as well as at angles of attack and with\na generic pylon for some conditions. In all, a sizable matrix of\nrotor blade setting angles, tip speed, and tunnel Mach number\ncombinations were investigated. In this paper, the focus is on a\nsmall subset of the un-installed (zero angle of attack)\nconfigurations that were run in the low speed regime at one set\nof blade angles, and one tunnel Mach number. The testbed\nF31/A31 open rotor is shown installed in the NASA 9- by 15foot wind tunnel in Figure 2.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217740\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94Top: GE/NASA Unducted Fan (UDF) model installed\nin NASA wind tunnel (1985). Bottom: GE UDF engine demonstrator installed on the MD-80 testbed aircraft (1987). UDF had\nequal blade counts, eight each on the front and aft rotors.\n\nFigure 2.\xe2\x80\x94Model scale F31/A31 historical baseline blade set\nshown installed in the NASA 9- by 15-foot wind tunnel (2010).\nThe front rotor of F31/A31 has 12 blades and its aft rotor has\n10 blades. Traversing inflow microphone system used for\nsideline acoustic pressure measurements is visible on the left.\n\n2\n\nsource distributions are traditionally called the thickness,\nloading, and quadrupole sources, corresponding to the three\nterms on the right hand side of Equation (1a), respectively. vn\n\nAeroacoustic Modelling\nThe methodologies for predicting open rotor noise can be\ncategorized into three main groups. The most basic approaches\nare empirical in nature which, as the name suggests, are based\non curve fits to database(s) of measured noise as a function of\nthe geometry and operating parameters of open rotors. Once\ndeveloped these are relatively easy to use and are often\nemployed for trend studies in the early phases of the design\nprocess. Their shortcoming, however, is that they cannot be\nreliably used to predict noise for configurations or operating\nconditions that are well outside of the envelope of the\ndatabases used for developing the models in the first place.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum are the high-fidelity\nnumerical approaches that can be used to solve for the\nunsteady flowfield of the open rotor and include, as part of the\nsolution, the noise field of interest. These types of methods\ntypically require sizable computational resources due to the\nhuge differences in the flow scales involved. For example,\nwhereas the background flow pressure levels may be at the\nambient atmospheric level, the acoustic perturbation levels of\ninterest are easily three to four orders of magnitude smaller.\nThis disparity necessities highly resolved grids nearly\neverywhere in the domain of interest thus driving up the\ncomputer memory and computational time requirements.\nIt is in the middle ground between these two extremes\nwhere most of the current state of practice resides. Typically,\nthe issue of scale disparity is circumvented by linearizing the\nequations of motion thus separating the nonlinear aerodynamic\nfield from the linear acoustic field. In the linearized methods,\nthe nonlinear aerodynamic field is specified, measured, or\ncomputed a priori and is introduced as source terms in the\nlinearized equations governing the acoustics. Computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) is most often used for that purpose.\nOnce this input information is specified, the acoustic equations\ncan be solved to estimate the acoustic field. The solution could\nbe affected by solving the linearized equations numerically,\nbut most often the solution is obtained using the Lighthill\xe2\x80\x99s\nacoustic analogy approach whose extension to the moving\nsurfaces is the Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings (FW-H) equation.\nThis equation describes the acoustic field as temporal and\nspatial integrals over aerodynamic source regions of interest\n(e.g., rotor blades and the surrounding flowfield). The\napproach used in this paper for predicting open rotor noise is\nbased on an asymptotic approximation to the FW-H equation\nwith the necessary aerodynamic input obtained via a\ncommercial CFD code.\n\nis the normal velocity of the blade, f j d S is the blade force,\nand T jk (the Lighthill stress tensor) represents the fluctuating\nstresses in the flowfield surrounding the rotor blades. Here\nonly the inviscid parts of f j and T jk are implied, since\nviscosity does not significantly contribute to the open rotor\nnoise field. In fact, we shall neglect the contribution of the\nquadruple source entirely since the focus of this paper is on\nthe low speed operating conditions for which the quadrupole\nsource does not significantly contribute to the noise field.\n\np\xe2\x80\xb2 ( x, t ) = \xe2\x88\x92\n\n\xe2\x88\x9e\n\n\xe2\x88\xab \xe2\x88\xab\n\n\xcf\x81 0 vn ( \xcf\x84 )\n\n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9e S ( \xcf\x84 )\n\xe2\x88\x9e\n\n\xe2\x88\xab \xe2\x88\xab\n\nf j ( \xcf\x84)\n\n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9e S ( \xcf\x84 )\n\xe2\x88\x9e\n\n\xe2\x88\xab \xe2\x88\xab\n\n\xe2\x88\x82G\ndS ( y ) d \xcf\x84 +\n\xe2\x88\x82y j\n\nT jk ( \xcf\x84 )\n\n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9e V ( \xcf\x84 )\n\nD0G\ndS ( y ) d \xcf\x84 +\nD\xcf\x84\n\n\xe2\x88\x82 2G\ndyd \xcf\x84\n\xe2\x88\x82y j \xe2\x88\x82yk\n\n(1a)\n\nD0 \xe2\x88\x82\n\xe2\x88\x82\n=\n+ U0 j\n\xe2\x88\x82y j\nD\xcf\x84 \xe2\x88\x82\xcf\x84\nIn this equation, G is the free-space, moving-medium Green\xe2\x80\x99s\nfunction given by\n\n1\n\xce\xb4 ( t \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x84 \xe2\x88\x92 g c R / c0 )\n4\xcf\x80\xce\xbaR\n1\n\xcf\x84)\ng c (= 2 \xce\xba \xe2\x88\x92 M 0R\n\xce\xb20\n\n=\nG ( \xcf\x84)\n\n(\n\n=\n\xce\xba ( \xcf\x84)\ne j ( \xcf\x84) =\n\xce\xb20 =\n\n)\n\n2\nM 0R 2 + \xce\xb20 , M 0= M 0 j e j\n( \xcf\x84)\nR\n\n(xj \xe2\x88\x92 yj ) ,\nR\n\n(1b)\n\nR ( \xcf\x84) = x \xe2\x88\x92 y ( \xcf\x84)\n\n2\n1\xe2\x88\x92 M0 j , M0 j =\n\nU0 j\nc0\n\nwhere g c and \xce\xba are factors that embody the effects of medium\n\nAcoustic Modelling\n\nconvection on the propagation time g c R / c0 and spherical\nspreading rate 1 / R .

This assumption results in\nconsiderable simplification of the integrands in Equation (1a)\nleading to semi-analytic formulas. See, for example, the\nmodels due to Hanson (Ref. 5) and Parry (Ref. 6). The\nstrategy used in this paper for carrying out the integrals in\nEquation (1a), while frequency-domain based, does not\nrequire such simplification and the resulting formulas are valid\nfor any observer (in the nearfield or in the farfield).\nSpecifically, the formulas used in this paper are extensions\nof the single rotation ones developed in Reference 7 to\naccount for the counter rotation configuration. The main\ndifference between the single and counter rotation versions is\nthe treatment of the loading noise. Another feature of the\nextended theory is that, owing to the linearity of the sound\nfield, the analysis is carried out for each rotor separately and\nthe resulting sound fields superimposed at the end. The\nderivation of the working expressions will closely follow that\ndescribed in Reference 7 and will use essentially the same\nnotation. The details of the derivation are included in the\nAppendix A and only final formulas are given here.\nOwing to the dominance of the open rotor spectra by tone\nnoise (see Fig. 3), in this study the modelling is focused on the\ntonal component of the noise spectrum.

It is a structured, multi-block, unsteady Navier-Stokes\nsolver which offers several solution algorithm choices along\nwith several acceleration strategies. The simulations can be\nrun in full unsteady mode though this could be quite resource\nintensive. To reduce the computational time requirements for\nthe time-dependant simulations, FINE/Turbo can also be run\nin the nonlinear harmonic (NLH) mode (Ref. 8) which solves\nfor a finite number of the blade passing frequency harmonic\ncomponents of the time-dependent solution, but ignores all the\nother unsteady components. This is a targeted approach\nfocusing on the relevant frequency content of the underlying\nunsteady flow. The net result is a very significant reduction in\nthe computational time requirements. This is the approach\nemployed in this paper for the purpose of computing the\naerodynamic response. In results to be presented later in the\npaper, the blade loading perturbation pressures associated with\nthe first three harmonics of the blade-passing frequency for\neach rotor were retained in addition to the blade mean pressure\nfield. Only three loading harmonics were chosen to keep the\ncomputational cost reasonable while still ensuring that the\nrelevant tones up to 50th shaft order could be modelled (see\nFig. 3). The implications of this choice will become clear\nwhen the acoustic predictions are discussed later in the paper.\nThe FINE/Turbo computational domain used in generating\nthe results presented here includes one passage each of the two\nblade rows and their associated ancillary domains like the\nspinner, hub, farfield, etc. (see Fig. 4). The total mesh size is\nslightly over 27.1 million grid points with the farfield boundary\nset seven tip radii away. The computations were run in parallel\nmode and depending on the particular simulation, the domain\nwas partitioned either into 39 or 42 blocks to achieve optimum\ncomputational load balance.\n\nmB \xe2\x88\x92 kB \xc2\xb5 \xe2\x88\x92i\xce\xa8\ne ( 1 2 )( \xef\x81\x8c \xef\x81\x8c ) \xc3\x97\n\nn =1 S B\n\n1\n\n2/3 2\n\xef\xa3\xb1\nAi \xef\xa3\xae( mB1 \xe2\x88\x92 kB2 ) \xce\xb3 \xef\x81\x8c \xef\xa3\xb9\n\xef\xa3\xb4\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb+\n\xef\xa3\xb2 d 0,n\n1/3\n( mB1 \xe2\x88\x92 kB2 )\n\xef\xa3\xb4\n\xef\xa3\xb3\n\nd1,n\n\xce\xa8=\n\xef\x81\x8c\n\n2/3 2\nAi \xe2\x80\xb2 \xef\xa3\xae( mB1 \xe2\x88\x92 kB2 ) \xce\xb3 \xef\x81\x8c \xef\xa3\xb9 \xef\xa3\xbc\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\xef\xa3\xb4\n\xef\xa3\xbd\n2/3\n( mB1 \xe2\x88\x92 kB2 )\n\xef\xa3\xb4\n\xef\xa3\xbe\n\n(2c)\n\n1\n\xce\xb7CRF M tip1 M 01 \xcf\x87 s + \xcf\x95 s \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x95\n\xce\xb201\n\nmB + kB2 \xe2\x84\xa62 / \xe2\x84\xa61\n\xce\xb7CRF =1\nmB1 \xe2\x88\x92 kB2\nwhere \xe2\x84\xa62 = 2\xcf\x80N 2 is the angular frequency and B2\xe2\x84\xa62 the\nblade passing frequency of the aft rotor.

Note that the loading\nnoise harmonic amplitude is a function of the difference\nparameter mB1 \xe2\x88\x92 kB2 . As will be discussed in the results\nsection this parameter plays a crucial role in determining the\nmagnitude of the various loading noise tones.\nNearly identical expressions for the aft rotor tone noise field\ncan be derived but with ( B1 , \xe2\x84\xa61 ) pair interchanged with\n( B2 , \xe2\x84\xa62 ) pair in Equations (2a) to (2c).

Table 1 shows the\nrotor tip speeds modelled in this paper. All cases considered\nhad equal rpms on the front and aft rotors. The nominal blade\nsetting angles were 40.1\xc2\xb0 for the front rotor and 40.8\xc2\xb0 for the\naft rotor in all cases. The tunnel Mach number (i.e., open rotor\n\xe2\x80\x9cforward flight speed\xe2\x80\x9d) was also fixed at 0.2. As was\nmentioned in the introduction, these cases represent a small\nsubset of a very large matrix of configurations for which\naerodynamic and acoustic data was acquired in the wind\ntunnel tests.\nThe starting point for the simulations was the highest tip\nspeed condition, which was converged first. It took a total of\n4000 iterations (3000 of them in NLH mode) to converge the\nsolution. The maximum residual, thrust, torque, and pressure\nratio had all settled after 3500 iterations, but the simulation\nwas run another 500 iterations to ensure complete\nconvergence. The acoustic calculations based on the 3500 and\n4000 iteration solutions were nearly identical also. Once\nconvergence had been achieved for this rpm, the next lower tip\nspeed condition was run starting with this converged solution\nas the initial solution. Typically, it took 2500 iterations to\nachieve full convergence. The process was repeated for the\nnext lower tip speed condition until all cases were computed.\nThe simulations typically used between 14 and 16 cores of a\n48-core compute node that is part of a NASA Glenn computer\ncluster each compute node of which has 128 GB of RAM.\nFigures 5 and 6 show comparisons of total thrust and torque\nratio predicted by FINE/Turbo against the wind tunnel data.\nThe agreement for thrust is quite good with an average\ndiscrepancy of 1.6 percent. The torque ratio comparison is\nonly fair with an average error of roughly 9 percent. It should\nbe noted that no tweaks were performed to adjust the blade\nangle, rotor tip speeds, or the tunnel Mach number to achieve\na better match with the data. In other words, the simulations\nrepresent true \xe2\x80\x9cpredictions\xe2\x80\x9d. 2\nFigure 7 shows the contours of predicted magnitude of the\nmean and first blade passing frequency harmonic of the static\npressure distribution on the front and aft blade rows as well as\non the hub. Note the change in scale of the contour levels\nbetween the mean and perturbation contours. A close\nexamination of the levels on the front and aft row shows that,\n\nFigure 5.\xe2\x80\x94Measured and predicted F31/A31 rotor thrust.\nCombined thrust produced by both rotors is plotted.\n\nFigure 6.\xe2\x80\x94Measured and predicted F31/A31 rotor torque ratio.\n\nwhile the mean loading levels on the front and aft rotors are\ncomparable, there is a significant difference between the\nmagnitudes of perturbation pressures on the two blade rows.\nThe aft row clearly experiences much higher levels of pressure\nfluctuations owing to the impingement of the wakes of the\nfront rotor, whereas the front rotor is only weakly affected by\nthe potential field of the aft rotor. Another noteworthy feature\nis that the suction side perturbations are larger than the\npressure side. The second and third harmonic pressure\nperturbations show similar trends to the first harmonic\ncomponent, but they are smaller than the first harmonic\ncomponent by roughly a factor of two and four, respectively.\n\n2\n\nThe blade shapes at the max climb condition supplied by GE\nwere used at all speeds studied here. Thus, the small variations in the\nhot blade shape due to the changes in centrifugal force as a function\nof rpm difference from the max climb condition were ignored.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217740\n\n6\n\nFigure 8.\xe2\x80\x94Sketch of the F31/A31 open rotor testbed and the\nsideline traversing microphone track as they were installed\nin the 9- by 15-foot wind tunnel. Acoustic data was acquired\nat a total of 18 microphone stops between the observer\nangles 18\xc2\xb0 and 140\xc2\xb0.\n\nAcoustic Predictions\n\nexactly the test arrangement in the NASA 9- by 15-foot wind\ntunnel shown in the sketch in Figure 8.\nDuring the test, the sideline acoustic data was acquired at 18\nmicrophone positions ranging between 18\xc2\xb0 and 140\xc2\xb0 from the\nopen rotor axis as shown in the figure. The data was acquired\nusing a traversing inflow microphone (see Fig. 2). Spectral\ndata was computed from 15-sec long time series acquired at\n200 kHz sampling rate with a 214 point FFT resulting in a\nfrequency bin width of 12.2 Hz. Consequently, the measured\ntone energy is spread across multiple bins (see Fig. 3).\nTherefore, to compare the measured levels to the predicted\nones (which have an effective bin width of zero), it was\nnecessary to sum the tone energy in the bins over which the\ntone is spread for the measured data.\nAs for the predictions, the loading component dominates the\ntotal level in all cases, hence only the predicted total is\npresented here. In any case, the experimental data cannot be\nparsed into constituent thickness and loading components. Also,\nwhile the data was acquired at 18 observer angles, the\npredictions were computed on a finer angular resolution of 51\nobserver angles to ensure that the nuances of the tone\ndirectivities were well captured. Lastly, given the number of the\nrpm and tone combinations, only highlights are presented here.\nFigure 9 shows a representative comparison of the predicted\ntone sound pressure level (SPL) from the LINPROP code with\nthe measured level for the highest tip speed (i.e., 6436 rpm) at\nthe broadside microphone location (i.e., observer angle of\n90\xc2\xb0). Predictions for the tones in the range from approximately\n1 to 5.3 kHz are shown (shaft frequency for this tip speed is\n107.3 Hz). This is because, the FINE/Turbo simulations\ninclude the mean and only the first three blade passing\nfrequency harmonics of the blade pressure loading for each\nrow, which determines how many open rotor tones could be\ncalculated based on the relationship mB1\xe2\x84\xa61 \xc2\xb1 kB2 \xe2\x84\xa6 2 .\n\nThe modified LINPROP code was run for all of the tip\nspeed conditions considered in this study. The calculations\nwere performed for observer (i.e., microphone) positions that\nare located in a horizontal plane containing the open rotor axis\nand on a sideline parallel to the axis of the open rotor and\n60 in. (i.e., 1.524 m) displaced from it. This layout duplicates\n\nTherefore, the noise predictions are restricted to the tones for\nwhich the loading harmonic k does not exceed 3.\nThe tones are labelled based on whether their origin is the\nfront rotor, aft rotor, or if they are produced as a result of the\ninteraction of the two. The frequency for each tone is given by\nmB1\xe2\x84\xa61 \xc2\xb1 kB2 \xe2\x84\xa6 2 where m, k = 0,1,2,3 . 3 The predicted levels\n\nFigure 7.\xe2\x80\x94Contours of predicted pressure distributions on the\nhub and rotor blades for F31/A31. (a) shows the mean pressure level and (b) the blade passing frequency harmonic level.\n\nBy plugging the blade geometries and aerodynamic pressure\ndistributions for each rotor into the Equations (2b) to (2c) the\nharmonic amplitudes of the thickness and loading tone noise\nwere calculated and combined to estimate the sound field of\nF31/A31. The noise prediction results are discussed in the next\nsection.\n\n3\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217740\n\n7\n\nm=k=0 does not result in an acoustic tone.\n\nFigure 10.\xe2\x80\x94Radiation efficiency of sum and difference tones\nas a function of the index mB1 \xe2\x88\x92 kB2 .\n\nFigure 9.\xe2\x80\x94Comparison of measured and predicted tone SPL\nat the broadside microphone location (i.e., observer angle\no\n90 ) at 6436 rpm. Tones are labeled according to their origin\n(i.e., front rotor tones, aft rotor tones, or interaction tones).\nThe labels are color coded according to whether the tones\nare based on sum (blue) or difference (brown) combinations.\n\nA number of tones for which the parameter mB1 \xe2\x88\x92 kB2 falls\nin the range 0 to 40 are identified on the abscissa. Tones\nwhose frequencies are above 14 kHz are not noted since\nbeyond that limit no discernible tones are detectable above the\nbroadband level in the measured spectra. Note the rapid fall of\nthe Ai and Ai\xe2\x80\xb2 as their arguments increase. It is easy to see\nfrom this plot that sum tones have far higher radiation\nefficiencies than do the difference tones. In fact, there are only\nthree difference tones in the range plotted. The radiation\nefficiencies of higher order difference tones are effectively\nnegligible.\nAnother notable aspect of this plot is that it shows that the\nradiation efficiencies of several interaction (sum) tones are\nsignificantly higher than the radiation efficiencies of the\nindividual rotor blade passing tones (i.e., BPF1 and BPF2). As\na result, even though the magnitude of the blade loading\xe2\x80\x99s\nhigher harmonics, which drive the interaction tones, are much\nsmaller than the mean loading, which drives the blade passing\ntones, their comparatively much higher radiation efficiencies\ncompensate for their source amplitude deficit (recall Fig. 7)\nthus making their levels, especially those for the low order\ninteraction tones, on par or even higher than the blade passing\nfrequency tone levels. Finally, it should also be noted that the\nhigher harmonic tones of the individual rotors (i.e., nBPF1 and\nnBPF2) also have comparatively smaller radiation efficiencies\nand thus are expected to fall off rapidly in amplitude as seen in\nthis plot.\nReturning to Figure 9, note that the low order interaction\ntones 1BPF1+1BPF2, 2BPF1+1BPF2, and 1BPF1+2BPF2, are\nwell predicted by the LINPROP code with discrepancies of\n1 dB or less, when considering the experimental uncertainty in\nthe measured levels which is \xc2\xb11 dB. The next set of\ninteraction tones, 3BPF1+1BPF2, 2BPF1+2BPF2, and\n1BPF1+3BPF2, show larger discrepancies when compared\nwith the measured levels and the discrepancy grows as the\n\ninclude the complex conjugate contributions corresponding to\nthe associated negative frequencies \xe2\x88\x92 mB1\xe2\x84\xa61 \xc2\xb1 kB2 \xe2\x84\xa6 2 . Before\ndiscussing the data-theory comparisons, it is important to note\nthe following in order to better understand the comparisons.\nAs indicated in Figure 9, most tones can be produced by\neither the sum or difference frequency combinations. In fact,\nwhile there is only one sum combination for a given tone,\nthere are infinitely many difference combinations possible.\nHowever, tones corresponding to virtually all frequency\ndifference combinations have extremely low radiation\nefficiencies and do not contribute to the tone SPL in a\nsignificant way. This is most easily seen by examining the\nterms inside the curly bracket in Equation (2c).\nNote that since for a given frequency combination\nmB1\xe2\x84\xa61 \xc2\xb1 kB2 \xe2\x84\xa6 2 , the tone amplitude is a function of the index\ncombination mB1 \xef\x81\xad kB2 , there can be substantial difference in\nthe radiation efficiency of the sum and difference tones. To\nelucidate the point, let\xe2\x80\x99s contrast two tones, one with the\nfrequency 12\xe2\x84\xa61 + 10\xe2\x84\xa6 2 and the other with the frequency\n\n12\xe2\x84\xa61 \xe2\x88\x92 10\xe2\x84\xa6 2 . The amplitudes of these two tones according\nto Equation (2c) will be functions of the index combinations\n12 + 10 and 12 \xe2\x88\x92 10 , respectively. Since, Ai and Ai\xe2\x80\xb2 decay\nrapidly as their arguments increase, the amplitude of the sum\ntone will far exceed the amplitude of the difference tone. The\nplot in Figure 10 depicts the point graphically. The plot shows\nthe dependence of the terms in the curly bracket in\nEquation (2c) on the parameter mB1 \xe2\x88\x92 kB2 for a source on the\ntip of the blade. The terms are each normalized by their value\nfor zero argument and plotted on a logarithmic scale.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217740\n\n8\n\ntone levels for the individual rotors of F31/A31 should level\noff (or even increase) below about 70\xc2\xb0 and above\napproximately 130\xc2\xb0.\n\ntone order (i.e., its frequency) increases. Since, as mentioned\nearlier, the interaction tones are driven by the harmonics of the\nunsteady loading on the blades, it is likely that to predict\nhigher order tones more computational grid resolution may be\nneeded to achieve better accuracy of the blade pressure\nloading harmonics. 4\nAs for the individual rotor tones, the theory over-predicts\nthe blade passing frequency tones BPF1 and BPF2, but underpredicts their harmonics, i.e., nBPF1 and nBPF2. Theses\ndiscrepancies may be explained by the following observation.\nThe experimental data show a preponderance of tones at all\nshaft orders (recall Fig. 3) including both odd and even order\nones. Yet, the theory only predicts even order tones (whether\nsum or difference ones) since the blade counts are even\nnumbers. The paradox can be explained by noting that the\ntheory (aerodynamic or acoustic) assumes that all of the blades\nin each rotor disc are identical and that they all experience the\nsame loading time history over the course of each rotor\nrevolution, but displaced spatially and temporally from that of\nthe reference blade. This assumption results in acoustic energy\nbeing distributed amongst a subset of shaft orders. The actual\nblades in a given rotor disc, however, are not exactly the same\nas they are hand finished (they are made of composites) and\nthey may not experience exactly the same time history due to\ninherent unsteadiness of the flow. Perhaps more importantly,\nthe setting angles for the blades in a given rotor disc vary\nwithin a small range (typically in the \xc2\xb10.1 \xc2\xb0 range for F31/A31\n(Ref. 9)) in a random fashion around the rotor disc thus\nslightly modifying the loading distribution on each blade.\nTherefore, for the actual rotors the precise phasing assumed by\nthe theory does not occur, a consequence of which is that the\nacoustic energy is distributed amongst all shaft orders rather\nthan just those singled out by the theory. As a result, some of\nthe energy that according to the theory would have amassed in\nBPF1 and BPF2 tones is leaked into their harmonics nBPF1 and\nnBPF2. The same mechanism could explain the measurable\nlevels for the difference tones (e.g., 2BPF2-2BPF1, 3BPF22BPF1, and 4BPF2-3BPF1), for which the theory predicts very\nsmall radiation efficiencies and, thus, levels that would be too\nsmall to be visible in Figure 9.\nNext, the variations of SPL on the sideline as a function of\nobserver angle for the BPF1, BPF2, and BPF1+BPF2 tones are\nexamined (see Fig. 11). While it is difficult to draw general\nconclusions about the data-theory comparisons on the absolute\nlevel basis, the trends in data appear to be reasonably well\npredicted except for the far upstream and far downstream\nangles for the BPF1 and BPF2 tones. It should be noted that the\npredicted rapid falloff of the SPL for BPF1 and BPF2 away\nfrom the vicinity of the respective planes of rotation (i.e., ~90\xc2\xb0\nobserver angle) is consistent with measured single rotation\nresults. It is not clear then, why the measured blade passing\n\nFigure 11.\xe2\x80\x94Sideline variations of SPL as a function of\nobserver angle for (a) BPF1, (b) BPF2, and (c) BPF1+BPF2\ntones at the 6436 rpm condition.\n\n4\n\nThis was partially borne out by comparing the results to those\nfrom a single case that was run with a mesh resolution of 42 M grid\npoints. However, the grid packing in the vicinity of the blade may be\na more important factor than grid resolution alone.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942012-217740\n\n9\n\nbe shown on the basis of the overall sound pressure level\n(OASPL). The principal reason for choosing the OASPL\nmetric goes back to discussion earlier regarding the acoustic\nenergy being distributed amongst all shaft order tones rather\nthan just those orders that the theory predicts. It could be\nargued that in that sense the OASPL should be a good metric\nto use regardless of how the acoustic energy is distributed\namongst the various tones. It should also be noted that since\nthe measured levels include both tone and broadband content,\nit is necessary to subtract the broadband levels from the\nmeasured data before calculating the OASPL. Lastly, based on\nthe discussion of the results in Figure 11, the OASPL\ncomparisons will be restricted to the observer angles in the 70\xc2\xb0\nto 130\xc2\xb0 range.\nFigure 12 shows the dependence of the OASPL on the rotor\ntip speed. Both measured and predicted OASPLs are shown\nfrom the highest tip speed (6436 rpm) on the top of the figure\nto the lowest tip speed (4620 rpm) on the bottom of the figure.\nGenerally speaking, the data-theory agreement is reasonable at\nthe higher tip speeds, but it deteriorates as the tip speed is\nreduced. The basic trend of decreasing OASPL with\ndecreasing tip speed in the measured data is captured by the\ntheory though not uniformly for all observer angles in that the\ndecrease in the predicted levels is slower than that in the\nmeasured data.\n\nConclusions\nThe results discussed in the previous section suggest that\nabsolute level predictions on a tone-by-tone basis for open\nrotors (or any turbomachinery system, for that matter) may be\nout of reach using the existing suite of tools (i.e., CFD +\nacoustic analogy). This may be true even when more\nsophisticated numerical methods that directly compute the\nnoise field from the field equations are brought to bear. This is\na consequence of the fact that any model that assumes\nidentical blades in each blade row, experiencing spatially- and\ntemporally-shifted time histories, is incompatible with the real\ngeometries, for which there always exist small manufacturing\nand installation variations as well as flow non-stationarity,\nwhich could in measurable ways alter the acoustic response of\nthe blades. Nevertheless, the basic trends seem to be\nreasonably well predicted using the combination of CFD and\nacoustic analogy (specifically, in this case, FINE/Turbo and\nLINPROP). This is enough of a capability for analysis and\noptimization ultimately aimed at developing low-noise open\nrotor designs. It may also be possible to modify the existing\nnoise models (such as that underlying the LINPROP code, for\nexample) to accommodate small, randomized variations in the\ngeometry and loading distributions on a blade-to-blade basis\nto mimic the real physics. The basic question here is whether\nthe size of required variations to get more realistic tone spectra\nwould turn out to be consistent with the expected variations in\nthe actual geometries. It is the aim of a future study to\ninvestigate this approach and its consequences.\n\nFigure 12.\xe2\x80\x94Sideline variations of OASPL as a function\nof the observer angle on the sideline.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES\n\n14. ABSTRACT\n\nOwing to their inherent fuel efficiency, there is renewed interest in developing open rotor propulsion systems that are both efficient and\nquiet. The major contributor to the overall noise of an open rotor system is the propulsor noise, which is produced as a result of the\ninteraction of the airstream with the counter-rotating blades. As such, robust aeroacoustic prediction methods are an essential ingredient in\nany approach to designing low-noise open rotor systems. To that end, an effort has been underway at NASA to assess current open rotor\nnoise prediction tools and develop new capabilities. Under this effort, high-fidelity aerodynamic simulations of a benchmark open rotor\nblade set were carried out and used to make noise predictions via existing NASA open rotor noise prediction codes. The results have been\ncompared with the aerodynamic and acoustic data that were acquired for this benchmark open rotor blade set. The emphasis of this paper is\non providing a summary of recent results from a NASA Glenn effort to validate an in-house open noise prediction code called LINPROP\nwhich is based on a high-blade-count asymptotic approximation to the Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings Equation. The results suggest that while\npredicting the absolute levels may be difficult, the noise trends are reasonably well predicted by this approach.\n15.
