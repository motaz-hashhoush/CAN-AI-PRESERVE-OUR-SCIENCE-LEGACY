The place was vacant; some one was needed to\ncover the earth with airplanes transporting passengers, \xe2\x80\x9cfreigh\xe2\x80\x99i\nand mail.\n\nFrance took the position. \xe2\x80\x98l\xe2\x80\x99heuture will \xe2\x80\x9c&-Qowhei...\nf\nw\n\ner those who had the courage to take such a risk actecl-%+jkely\n,,..\n,-,.\nand weil.\nTo be a pioneer requires a certain amount of recklessness.\nWe went wherever we could. In the twii~kling an eye we creof\nated the routes Paris-London, Paris-Brussels, Paris-StrasburgPrague-?;arsaz~-,\nParis-Geneva, 130rdeaux-\xe2\x80\x99Tou.louse-Vontpellter,\nNimes-lIarseilles Toulouse-Casablanca, Bayonne-Bilbao, etc.\n,\nThese lines were necessary to the affirmation of our suprema~,\nThey were also useful as a first experience.\nAt present the supremacy is acquired; the experience also.\nNow it is time, not\n\nto change our Folioy, but to consolidate\n\nthe positions gained,\nThis woxk of consolidation falls to the lot of Colonel Casss.\nsuccessor of.Colonel Saconney as Directoz of Aerial Navigation,\nand will be undertaken in close collaboration with Mr. Laurent\nEynac, Under Secretary of State for Aeronautics.\nIn the present state of things, there are three great problems to be solved, relating respectively to the financial, tech\xe2\x80\x94. -\xe2\x80\x94..\n* From ttLIAilto,H\nSeptember 29~ 1922.\n.\xe2\x80\x94\n\nHappy the nation which first finds the solution,\nFinancial..\nProblem. Our ordinary budget cannot be increased.\nParliament refuses, common sense is against it, and if we attempt,\nto economize in other departments in order to have more moneY for .\nthe Air Service,.\nwe\xe2\x80\x99shallmake a great mistake. Thus, the budget\nof Civil Aviation has,\n\nso\n\nto\n\ns~y,\n\nreac]led\n\ni.ts\n\ncetling.\n\nTechnical Problem,- We have no commercial airplanes equal to\nthe various aims in view. We have no such airplanes in semice,\n\xe2\x80\x98Outwe have them in the offices and laboratories of our factozies\nand on flying fields. It will probably be eighteen months or two\nYears before the three-engined commercial ai~planeS seen in the\nlaSt\n\nAviation Show are being used by the Aerial\n\nnies.\n\nNavigation\n\n(kXIlpEi-\n\nThe first one built must be tested by the constructor,\n\nchecked by the S.T.Ae., retested by the constructor, rechecked by\nthe S.T.Ae.\n\nThen a\xe2\x80\x9cfew of these airp~ane~ mi~~ be ordered and\n\nwill be tried out in actual\n\nservice,\n\nfor an Aerial Navigation\n\nCOmpany is no longer allowed to have air~lanes made in quantity\nproduction before having actually employed them in sezvice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x9c\n\nThen the series ordered must be built, and all these divers operations will certainly take the time mentioned above.\nIn parenthesis we may say that this\n\nhas been taken\n\nquestion\n\nup by the Government and the Under Secretary of state\n\nrecently\n\nwrote to the Chambre Syndicale des Industries Aeronautiques point-\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\ning out the urgent\n\nnature\n\nof the questibfi,\nand declaring that the\n\nGovernment wou].dnot \xe2\x80\x9chaggle:\xe2\x80\x99\nover the premiums to b6 awarded to\nprototypes-------\n\n.. . ..\n.\n. .. .. ..\n\nCommercj.al\nPzoblem.- Immediately aftez the armistice, oompa\xe2\x80\x94.\nZlie6\n\n,\n\nas\n\nwell as line3, increased rapid~.yin number. One had\n\nonly to pz:eseutonesel: to the S.N*Ae. with a list of names, one\nof which was known, to be accepted as a Director of an Aerj.al\nNavigation Company and receive a subsidy. Almost all o\xe2\x80\x99fthe companies rushed on the lines\xe2\x80\x99\nwhi@\n\npromised the best returns.\n\nThere was much useless intestine competition. In the present\nstate of commercial aviation the\nthan they earn,\n\n~ompanies\n\nare\n\nThe monetary confidence Of\n\nspending\n\ntheir\n\nmuch more\n\nshareholders\n\nwould rapidly be exhausted were it not that there is already a\nmovement towards concentration of action among the various companics.\nTHE GREAT CURRENTS OF AIR TRAFFIC.\nWe thus catch a glimpse of the policy to be followed by the\nS.N.Ae. and the $.S.E.\nClose down the lines which do not pay.\n\n.\nTne airpl-aneis a\n\nlong-distance transport machine and, if possible, should be employed for international distances. We have had enough experienc~.\nto see clearly what are the great uirrents of air traffic: ParisBrussels-Amsterdam, and, eventually, Scandinavia; Paris-Strasbuzg\nprague-~arsaw, and, if possible, Russia; Paris-Prague-Constantine\nFle, a line which seems to have reached its horizontal point;.\n\nI\n\n-4London-Pazis-Lyons-Marseilles, and, Zater, a cross the Meditefxanean when we have lazge seaplanes or airshipsj Antibe&A jaccio\n-\n\nTun:.s,on the one hand, Toulouse-Ca~ablanca, on the othef, to jd~.:~\ntinemother-country to French Africa; finally, Algiers-Biskra,\nwith a hoped-for extension to the French Soudan. ,\n\xe2\x80\x98Such are the great aerial lines which the S,N.Ae. wishes.to\nmaintain. For each of these zones, only one company will be appointed, or rather,\n\nonly\n\none\n\ncompany wilz be subsidized. This ~\n\npolicy will bring about amalgamations and suppressions. It will\nbe remembered that at one time the paris-Lend.on\nroute was being\nworked by three French companies> then by two.\nthat in a fe:~weeks! time the Grands\n\nE::press\n\nIt is probable\n\nAeriens\n\nwill\n\nbe amal-\n\ngamated with the Messageries Ae%iennes, \xe2\x80\x98~helatter having the\nLondon-Marseilles iine and the Paris-E)russels-Ams%erdam\nline.\nThe Frailco-Flou.maine\nCO-iEpany should evidently have the Iifie\nwhich stre-tches\nout one am\n\ntowards po~and and the other towards\n\nTurkey. Late\xe2\x80\x99co&re\nwill keep the main line Toulouse-Casablanca\nand its branches.\n\nThe Aero-Navale will keep Antibes-Tunis, and\n\nthe France-American Sooiety will be subsidized for all the lines\nrunning from the coast of Africa to the desert.\nThese subsidies will not necessarily mean monopolies. Any\nother company will be free to work, say, the Paris-London route\nin competition with another French company, but no subsidy will\nbe granted to the competitor, and this will practically result in\nexcluding competition,\n\n-5Furthezmore, the Aerial Navigation Semite\n\ndoes not say that\n\nno other lines than these are to be subsidized within a given time.\nIf home affairs permitted, or if international competitioti\ndemand~\ned further subsidies, we are sure that the Sezvice would not hesitate to abandon its ylicy\n\nof consolidafiion\nand would not lightly\n\nallow foreigners to work lines %Thichwe can work alone or \xe2\x80\x98withthe\nhelp of other nations.\nLONG DATE SUBSIDIES.\nThus the companies, free fzom home competition, can set Up\na strong organization in their respective zones of action. But\nthis is not all.\n\nThey are not yet making a living. The money\n\ngranted by the State forms a lazge part of their annual balance,\nand this grant is uncertain,\n\nIt is voted for one year.\n\nHow are\n\nthey to know that the following yeax it will not be refused or\ngreatly reduced? The State ought to make contracts with the oompanies running for a -periodlong enough to enable the shareholders to derive a certain profit over and above the interest on\nthe money.\nNo one would have been found to work one of our railway lines\nhad the concession only covered a period of twelve months.\n\nThat\n\nis why the State is now trying to make ten year contracts. This\nhas been voted. Parliament and pzobab2y two teiiyear concessions\nby\nwill be granted before the end of the year.\n\nBut the State is con-\n\nsidering the granting of thirty year contracts with a guarantee of\ninterest on the capital involved.

For\n\ninstance, there are some airplanes, designed for two hundxed hoursl\nflight, which are good for two years. Airplanes of 1%20 are still\nin use.\n\nFor these airp).anesthere are not enough spare ~arts.\n\nIt\n\nis the intention of the government to request the companies to reduce the number of\n\nai.zplanes\n\nan&\n\n.to increase\n\ntheir\n\nof spares\n\nStOCk\n\n30 tb~t a time will come when an airplane, instead of having only\none engine allotted to it, mi~l have three - one in use, and *WO\nas spares.
