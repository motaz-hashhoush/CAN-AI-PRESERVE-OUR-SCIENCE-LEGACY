This figure only includes\nthose maps with an areal extent of 4 x lO1* km2 or\ngreater. These maps are contoured either at 10\nmgal or 25 mgal intervals and include a compilation of all available surface-ship, submarine and\nland gravity measurements. A significant proportion of the data used in these maps is now available from the NGDC*.\n\nIntroduction\nThe technique of measuring gravity at sea has\nbeen greatly improved by the development of\nspring-type surface-ship gravimeters which can\nbe operated in a wide variety of sea conditions\n(LaCoste, 1967; Graf and Schulze, 1961). Since\nabout 1961 surface-ship gravity measurements\nhave been obtained on a routine basis in each\nof the world\'s major ocean basins. By combining\nsurface-ship gravity measurements with measurements obtained earlier on board submarines\n(Vening Meinesz, 1948; Worzel, 1965) it is now\npossible to construct gravity anomaly maps of\nlarge regions of the world\'s oceans. These\nmaps form an important basis for geodetic,\ngeological and geophysical studies.\nSince the development of the concept of\nplate tectonics there have been two approaches\nto the interpretation of marine gravity data\nthat have proved particularly useful. The first,\nbased on the pioneering studies of Vening Meinesz\n(1941) and Gunn (1947), uses relatively shortwavelength (wavelength X < 400 km) gravity anomalies in oceanic regions to provide information\non the long-term (>106 years) mechanical properties of the oceanic lithosphere (for example,\nWalcott, 1970; Watts and Cochran, 1974; Watts\net al., 1975).^ The second, uses relatively longwavelength (X > 400 km) gravity anomalies in\noceanic regions to provide information on the\nforces which operate on the plates and which may\nultimately drive them (for example, Anderson et\nal., 1973; Sclater et al., 1975; Watts, 1976;\nMcKenzie, 1977).\nThe purpose of this paper is to present a\nbrief review of some of the most recent developments in marine gravity. The extent of marine\ngravity data coverage is illustrated in a compilation map of the main free-air gravity anomaly\nmaps of the world\'s oceans which have been published since 1974. A brief discussion of some of\nthe main results in the interpretation of marine\ngravity is given and some comments made on recent\ndeterminations of the gravity field in oceanic\nregions using satellite radar altimeters.\n\nInterpretation\n\nGravity Measurements\nDuring the past few years there have been increased efforts to obtain gravity measurements in\noceanic regions, particularly aboard U.S.,\nU.S.S.R., and Japanese research vessels (Table 1).\nGravity measurements have now been obtained along\nmore than 2 million nautical miles of ship\'s\ntracks. Although the accuracy of gravity measurements obtained on individual ship\'s cruises\ndepends on the types of navigation and instrumentation used, the standard error of these measurements (Table 1) based on studies of discrepancies at intersecting ship\'s tracks is estimated\n\nStudies have now been carried out which have\nused marine gravity data to determine information on the deformation (or flexure) of the\noceanic lithosphere caused by surface loads\nsuch as sediments (Gunn, 1944; Walcott, 1972;\nCochran, 1973) and seamounts (Gunn, 1943;\nWalcott, 1970; Watts and Cochran, 1974; Watts\net al., 1975). An important parameter in these\nstudies is the effective flexural rigidity which\nis determined mainly by the effective elastic\nthickness of the oceanic lithosphere. By comparing observed gravity anomalies with calculated\nanomalies based on simple elastic or viscoelastic\nmodels it has been possible to estimate the\neffective elastic thickness and how it may vary\nwith crustal age. The main results of these\nstudies, summarized in Watts ( 9 8 , is that\n17)\nsurface loads formed at or near mid-ocean ridge\ncrests are associated with relatively small\nvalues of the effective elastic thickness while\nsurface loads formed on relatively old lithospheric plates are associated with relatively\nlarge values.\nFigure 2 is a plot of "isostatic response\nfunction" for the East Pacific rise crest and\nHawaiian-Emperor seamount chain in the Pacific\nocean. This figure shows that the range of\nwavelengths which provide information on isostasy at the East Pacific rise is 30 to 300 km\nwhile that for the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount\nchain is 200 to 800 km. The importance of\nthese functions, however, (for example, Lewis\nand Dorman, 1970; McNutt and Parker, 1978) is\nthat they can be easily compared to different\nmodels of isostasy. Figure 2 shows that the\nobserved "isostatic response function" for the\nEast Pacific rise crest and Hawaiian-Emperor\nseamount can be explained by a simple flexure\nmodel with values of the effective elastic\nthickness of the oceanic lithosphere in the\nrange 2 to 6 km and 20 to 30 km respectively.\nRecent studies have shown (Detrick and\nWatts, in preparation; Watts, Bodine, and\nRibe, in preparation) that the "isostatic\nresponse functions" in Figure 2 can explain\ngravity data over a wide variety of other geological features. In particular, the ridge\n\nProc. of the 9th CHOP Conference. An /nleriiutitintil S\\-mptt\\inin tin sh? Appliffiiit>n\\ itf\n<iL\'t>(U\'*\\-urGi\'tnlyiiiitnic\\. Oi-tuher2-5,1978.

These results are in general\' agree-\xe2\x80\xa2\nment with the observation that a number of\ngeological features on the ocean floor orig-.\ninated either at or near a mid-ocean, ridge\ncrest (ridge crest and fracture zone topography, Walvis and Ninetyeast ridges) .or as\na relatively young load on an.old litho- \xe2\x80\xa2\nspheric plate (Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain,\nMid-Pacific seamounts, Louisville ridge).\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\nAlthough these studies have used marine\ngravity data to provide information on the\nmechanical behavior of the oceanic lithosphere.\nthey provide little information on the forces,\nwhich may be operative on the plates. The main\nproblem is that the mechanical and thermal\nproperties of the oceanic lithosphere serve to\nobscure the gravity effect of deeper processes\nin the Earth such as mantle convection.\nA useful \'approach to this problem has been\nto examine the relationship between long-wavelength gravity anomalies and deviations in\nexpected depth of the sea-floor (or residual\ndepth anomalies) for broad regions of the\nworld\'s oceans (Anderson et al., .1973; Sclater\net al., 1975; Watts, 1976). These studies\nshow that a good correlation between gravity\nand residual, depth anomalies exists, at least\nfor the North Atlantic and Central Pacific\nOceans. A correlation between long-wavelength\ngravity and residual depth anomalies makes\na good argument for convection. Recently,\nhowever, Cochran and Talwani, ( 9 8 concluded\n17)\n\nfrom a global data set that there was, in\ngeneral,-, a poor visual correlation between longwavelength gravity and depth anomalies in the\nworld\'s oceans. In addition, Detrick and\nCrough . 1 7 ) have proposed the residual depth\n(97\nanomaly, in the Central Pacific ocean formed by\nlithospheric thinning over an underlying "hot\nspot". Future studies should therefore attempt\nto establish a relationship between gravity and\nresidual depth anomalies as a function of wavelength since this information appears to be the\nmost likely to constrain models of mantle convection (McKenzie, 1977).\nGEOS-3 Satellite Altimeter Data\nWith the advent of satellite altimetry it is\nnow possible to determine the shape of the\nmarine geoid with a great deal of accuracy\n(Leitao et al., 1975; Leitao and McGoogan,\n1975). In the absence of noise, gravity anomalies derived from GEOS-3 altimeter data, for\nexample, would be equivalent to gravity anomalies measured on surface-ships. In the presence\nof noise, however,.surface-ship gravity measurements provide the best means to determine the\nshort-wavelength gravity field in the oceans\nwhile GEOS-3 altimeter data provide the best\nmeans to determine the long wavelengths.\nIn a recent study Rapp (in press) has\nrecovered .1; x 1\xc2\xb0 average gravity, anomalies\nfrom ,GEOS-3 altimeter data and compared them\nwith averages determined from surface ship and\nland measurements; The RMS difference between predicted and terrestrial 1 x 1 \xc2\xb0 gravity\nanomaly averages was \xc2\xb116 mgal for the Philippine\nsea region\'and \xc2\xb18 mgal for the East Coast, U.S.\n\n252\n\n,,,,,,.,,\n,\xe2\x80\x9e,-,.,..,\ninnnimtjfA etyy\'i\'t"t\xc2\xbb!ti!i.\nmy .)\n\n:\nGRAVITY MEASURMENTS OVER THE\nf\nWORLD\'S OCEANS\n:\n; ~\\\n(Data collected up to January 1978)\n\xe2\x80\xa2^^\xe2\x80\x94Lamont-Doheity Geological Observatory\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2:\n\n:\n\n^-^v,\n\n^^~X <,\n\n*{$%\n\n\'\n\n-&\xe2\x80\xa2\n\niiiiuuiiiiiiujutiiuuiuinllhmuijiiiujliidiimuuiiijuuiiiiimituujujujiiijjmimi^\n!\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xab\' 15H ita\nfO in) -1\'\'0 -1RO - 1W -1\xc2\xab1 -IX "If^J *11O -10O \xe2\x80\xa2 9U -BO -~O\n\n-FO\n\n-SO -\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb\n\n-HO\n\nill\n\n-10\n\n0\n\nin\n\n20\n\n_\n33\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2*?\n\nFigure 1. Location map showing coverage of gravity data of Lamont-Doherty\nresearch vessels R/V Robert D. Conrad, Vema and Eltanin (Table 1) up to\nOctober 1978. The heavy lines outline those recently published free-air\ngravity anomaly maps of the world\'s oceans with an area greater than\n4 x 10 km2. The sources of the maps are as follows: 1. Watts, Bowin,\nBodine (1978); 2. Watts (1976); 3. Talwani and Kahle (1975); 4. Watts,\nBodine, Kogan (in press); 5. Watts (1975); 6. Watts and Talwani (1974);\n7. Bowin (1976); 8. Rabinowitz (1977); 9. Grtfnlie and Talwani ( 9 8 .\n17)\nregion. Thus, in these regions, which include\na variety of different geological features,\ngravity anomalies can apparently be recovered from GEOS-3 altimeter data with a resolution of about 200 km and a standard error of\nabout \xc2\xb112 mgal.\nThe overall usefulness of GEOS-3 altimeter\ndata for lithospheric studies can be evaluated\nby comparing these estimates of resolution with\nthose which are required to define.isostasy at\nthe East Pacific rise crest and Hawaiian-Emperor\nseamount chain (Fig. 2). The "isostatic response\nfunctions" in Figure 2 explain surface-ship gravity data in the region of the Hawaiian-Emperor\nseamount chain and East Pacific rise crest with\nan average standard error of \xc2\xb112 mgal and \xc2\xb14\nmgal respectively. These errors can be attributed to features of the gravity field of\nthese regions which are not related to isostasy.\nThus in order to provide information on the .\nstate of isostasy of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, a resolution of at least 200 km\n(Fig. 2) with a standard error of better than\n\n\xc2\xb112 mgal is required, while at the East Pacific\nrise crest a resolution of at least 30 km (Fig.\n2) with a standard error of better than \xc2\xb14 mgal\nis required.\nThese considerations suggest GEOS-3 altimeter\ndata may provide useful information on the state\nof isostasy of relatively young loads on old\nlithospheric plates (Hawaiian-Emperor seamount\nchain) but appears unlikely to provide useful\ninformation on isostasy of features formed on\nyoung oceanic crust near mid-ocean ridge crests.\nThe most promising use of GEOS-3 altimeter\ndata appears to be in the improved definition\nof the long-wavelength gravity field. Of particular interest is the information which may be\npresent in GEOS-3 altimeter data on deep processes in the Earth such as those which may be\nassociated with mantle convection.\nAcknowledgments.
