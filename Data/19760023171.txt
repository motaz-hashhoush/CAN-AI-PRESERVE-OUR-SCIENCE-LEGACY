NASA needs to understand which\nsupport equipment under consideration is potentially useful for DoD\nSTS payloads as they are currently planned. The objective of the\nstudy is to describe, from NASA\'s point of view, the potential for\nNASA/DoD common usage of ancillary equipment.\n\n*\t\n\nIn the Ancillary Equipment Study the ancillary equipment\nneeds for DoD payloads were examined. These equipment needs were\nthen matched against the MMSE planned by NASA for study or definition by\nNASA in the coming year. Thirty-four on-line MMSE items are potentially\napplicable to one or more DoD payloads in the near term. Similarly,\n19 of the launch site MMSE are candidates for application to DoD payloads.\nThese 53 candidate equipments were then examined in light of the ancillary\nequipment needs in accordance with DoD STS/payload interface contractor\nstudies and the data available on near-term DoD STS payloads. The\nend products of this effort are the descriptions of the potentially applicable MMSE items to DoD payloads, as described on the MMSE Data\nSheets presented in Section 5 and summarized in Section 2.\nIn accomplishing this study, the MMSE was taken\ndirectly from the NASA MMSE catalogs (see References 1 and 2).\n\nWhenever possible, the MMSE was used in accordance with the description furnished in the Martin Marietta study. If modifications to the\nMMSE description appeared to be desirable for the purpose of enhancing\nthe applicability to DoD payloads, the recommendation for such modification is described on the MMSE Data Sheets presented in Section 5.\nThe orbiter/payload interface used in these studies was that presented by Rockwell International in the DoD STS Payload Interface Concept Studies > (see\nReferences 3 and 4).\n1-1\n\nY\n\n5\n!\t\nf\n\nv\n\nThe initial upper stage (IUS) assumed for this study uses\nsolid propellant rocket engines.\t The IUS/payload structural interface\nis identical to the Transtage interface.\t Performance and other features\nassumed for the IUS are those described in the STS Users\' Guide, Section\n10 (see Ref. 5).\t These latter data represent a so-called "generic" IUS.\n\n1\n\n8\n\nThe STS/payload interface studies used as a basis for DoD \t\nancillary equipment needs in this study have been accomplished by DoD\ncontractors over the past three years ( see Refs. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10).\nThese studies covered six DoD satellites plus a Radio Isotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG).\t Thus the ancillary equipment needs for these\nsix satellites could be defined adequately. Six other satellite projects\nfrom the DoD Space Mission Model (FY 1980 through FY 1991), Revision\n4 (see Ref. 11), were also covered by this study.\t The interface equipment needs for these six other satellites are similar to the needs for\none or more of the six satellites studied by DoD STS payload interface\nstudy contractors.\nThe tasks covered in this report were accomplished in the\nperiod April through September 1975.\t\n\n{\n\n"\n\nl!\n\nt\n\nf-\n\n1\n\nE\n\n4,.\nH.\n\n\'\n\n1-2\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n^F \'POOR QUALITY\n\n2. SUMMARY OF RESULTS\n\nThe Multi-Mission Support Equipment (MMSE) potentially\napplicable to the six DoD payloads studied are listed in Table 2-1.\nThe table indicates the individual satellite projects to which each MMSE\nis applicable. In addition, the table indicates which equipments are\napplicable to multiple payload configurations when more than one\nproject\'s payload would be flown on the STS. For instance, when\nthe equipment is used only if the DSCS satellite were flown either with\nthe DSP or FSC satellites, or could be flown with a non-DoD satellite,\nit is indicated in the column under multiple payload. The number of\nother DoD satellite projects listed in the DoD Space Mission Model\nto which each of the equipments is potentially applicable is listed in\nthe column headed "other."\nTable Z-Z summarizes the potential applicability of MMSE\nto the DoD and non-DoD payloads. The applicability to the non-DoD\npayloads is that determined in the Martin Marietta MMSE study (see\nRefs. 1 and 2, and 12 through 17). The NASA status for each of the MMSE\nitems listed is shown in accordance with the recommendations made\nby MLSFC to NASA Headquarters in the June MMSE review. Also shown\nare the date of the first flight which has a potential need for each of\nthe equipments recommended for DoD application and an estimate of\nthe first date on which interface definition information would be needed\nby a DoD payload project.\nIn the near term STS era, 15 on-line MMSE items were\nfound to have one or more potential users among the DoD payload\nprojects. Eight of the 15 MMSE items are associated with the IUS/\n\nORIGMAL PAGE IS \t\n,OF,\' POOR QUALITY\n\nZ-1\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nSOSS\n\nX\n\nRTG\n\nMultiple\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\n05-04\n06-03\nX\n\nX\n\n05-03\n\n5\n\n5\n\nX(5)\n\n1\n\nX\nX\n\n^{(4)\n\n10 + Mult(1)\n1\n\n10 + Mult(l)\n\nMult(5)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n3\n\n1 tM lt<1)\'\n[1 +Muldl)j( 2)\n[1 tMu1t(1)j(Z)\n10\n10\n\n2\n\nTotal\n\n7\n1(3)\n5\n9 (1\t)^ (2)\n1(2) [2 +Mule\n\n1\n\n4\n\nOther\n\n5\n5\n\nX\nX(2)\nX(2)\n\nX2\nXO\n\nPayload(1)\n\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nDMSP\n\nX(5)\nX\n\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCPS\n\nX\n\nX\nX(2)\nX(2)\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nX\nX(2)\n\nX\n\nFSC\n\n,\n\nTwo different payloads (DSCS-II & DSP, DSCS-II & FSC) sharing IUS flight, ;E 7S operator may be the "user".\nXPLS-3 and XPMB-2 used if XPLS-3 design diameter increased as recommended (see MMSE sheet) instead of PLS-4, PMB-2 and\nITA-1.\nRecommended looking into tandem mounting of XPMB-1 (up to 3 decks). \t\nAdditional use in shared flights is possible but needs additional study.\nModified to service IUS in payload bay with "add-a-cable" approach.\n\nOrbiter/Payload Service\nCable and J-Box\nOrbiter/Payload Service\nCable (IUS Deployed)\nPayload Umbilical Cable\nPurge System\n\nX\n\nDSP\n\nX\n\nDSCS-II\n\nPOTENTIAL DOD SATELLITE APPLICATIONS, PRE-TUG ERA\n\n05-01\n\n06-01\n\nAvionics\n\n06-02\n\nPayload Shroud\n\nAPS-I\nGPP-2,\n\nPIA-3\nXPBM-1\nXPBM-2\nPMB-2\nXPLS-2\nXPLS-3\nPLS -4\nITA-1\nPSP-1,2\nSLP-1\n\nPiA-2\n\nIdent.\n\nRTG Cooling Unit\nSTS/Payload Power and\n\nPayload Interface Adapters\nPayload Mounting Beam\nPayload Mounting Beam\nPayload Mounting Beam\nPayload Spacer\nPayload Spacer\nPayload Spacer\nIUS/Tug Adapter\nPayload Service Plates\nSeparation Latch & Pushoff\nOrbiter/Payload\' Structure\ni\nAutomated Payload Supt.\n\'General Purpose Platform\n\nPayload Interface Adapters\n\nIUS/Payload Structure\n\nName\n\nMMSE\n\nl\n\na\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\ni\n\nTable 2-2.

The General Purpose\nPlatform (GPP-2) could be used to mount anyone of three DoD payloads\npiggyback in the orbiter bay in the Spacelab tunnel. Even though the\nAutomated Payload Support (APS-1) could be applied to at least the DMSP\npayload, it is not recommended for further consideration as a common\nNASA/DoD equipment since (1) the General Purpose Platform is\nexpected to be a preferred method of support, and (2) excessive\ndynamic loads for cantilever-mounted payloads are expected. ,A\npayload shroud may be needed by at least one DoD payload (DSP) and\nMMSE item 06-02 is large enough to accommodatethe DSP. In addition,\nthe low earth altitude payloads SOSS and DMSP may need shrouds. If\nthe MMSE shroud can be mounted from the payload itself, it may be\napplicable to the DMSP payload as well.\nThe RTG Cooling Unit (06 -01) satisfies the DoD cooling\ncapacity requirements and could be a common MMSE item for DoD and\nNASA.\nThe Orbiter/Payload Servicing Cable (IUS Deployed) MMSE\nitem (05-03) is potentially useful to at least ten DoD payloads andsome\nmultiple payloads on the IUS. The Payload Umbilical Cabling (05 -04)\nwhich mates with the servicing cable could also be used. Another\nMMSE item labeled Orbiter/Payload Service Cable, and J-Box (05 - 01)\nwould be applicable to multiple payload configurations in the payload\nbay if some weight reduction modifications to the approach could be\nincorporated.\nThe MMSE Purge System (06-03) could be used by the DoD\npayload DMSP to satisfy purging and cooling requirements.\n\n2-5\n\n^ti\n\nI\n\nj\t\n\nTable 2-3 summarizes the potential applicability of launch\nsite MMSE to DoD payloads. Of the 19 MMSE items studied, 13 were\ndetermined to be potentially applicable to DoD. The applicability of\nthe remaining six items could not be determined at this time. These\nequipment iterrLs are fluid ,servic-e units and further definition of the\nDoD satellites is needed to determine whether or not the services are\nrequired.\nOf the 13 launch site MMSE items applicable to DoD payloads,\nsix are STS-peculiar and therefore are expected to be new developments.\nThese are the containers (items -10 and \xe2\x80\xa2 11), the transponders (items\n-39 and -41), the mechanical payload simulator (item -07), and the\ninterface verification equipment (IVE). Each of these items is recommended for -consideration as potential NASA/DoD\xc2\xb0ancillary equipment.\nThe remaining seven launch site MMSE items applicable to\nDoD payloads (platforms,_ handling fixtures, slings, stands, and service\nunits) are expected to be in existence at the time the STS is phased in\nas the payload launch vehicle. When the STS payload launch site facilities\nare better defined, these seven items should be reviewed again to see\nif the ,existing equipments are .applicable to and compatible with the\nSTS facilities:\nAlthough a justification task -vas not a part of this study,\nit is expected that DD\'T&E costs would be lowered for both DoD and\nNASAby sponsoring common interface equipments (MMSE). In addition, there are potential advantages for system operators, Orbiter\nturnaround costs and payload installation time couldbe saved by the\nuse of common on-line interface equipment. The use of a standard\ninterface between the IUS and the NASA and ,DOD payloads would greatly\nfacilitate the IUS operation with multiple payloads.\n\ni\n\n?i\n2-:6\n\nTable 2-3.

DOD PAYLOAD AND STS/PAYLOAD INTERFACE DATA\nThe DoD payload information used in the Ancillary Equipment\nStudy was taken from two sources. The classified DoD Space Mission\nModel (Revision 4) lists data describing the gross satellite characteristics officially sanctioned for use in this study. The DoD STS/Payload\nInterface Studies have been made using payload information which differs\nfrom that contained in the mission model. The latter data are unclassified and generally correspond to current satellite characteristics.\nSix DoD satellites (DSCS-II, FSC, DSP, GPS, SOSS, and DMSP) were\nstudied.\n\n1\t\n\nThe STS payload interface equipment needs were derived\nfrom the contractor study information. If the need for the equipment\nwas expected to be affected by the changes in satellite characteristics\nexhibited in the DoD Space Mission Model, the study result was altered\nto account for this effect.\nThe DoD STS/payload interface contractors studied on-line\nintegration and the DoD needs for the payload changeout room. No\nconsideration was given to the need for GSE (launch site .MMSE) in\nthese studies. The assessment of the utility of the launch site MMSE\nwas thus limited to consideration of the gross characteristics and\npotential requirements for the DoD payloads. This was appropriate\nsince only verbal descriptions (as opposed to descriptions with numerical\nvalues for equipment characteristics) were available for most of the\nlaunch site MMSE.\n\n4-1\n\n_s\n\n\t\n\nAlthough the STS/Payload Interface Study contractors for\nDoD recommended some equipments for the payload specialists functio\nat the Payload Specialist Station (PSS) in the orbiter, these were not\nassessed as a part of this effort. The PSS equipments were eliminated\nbecause of the DoD guidance directing a minimal payload/STS interface\nwhich was issued subsequent to the contractors\' studies and applies\nto the near-term DoD STS payloads.\n4.1\t\n\nDOD PAYLOAD DATA SHEETS\n\nAs a part of the Ancillary Equipment Study, a DoD Payload\nData Sheet format was derived and the data available from the DoD\nSTS/payload interface contractor studies (Ref. 6 through 10) were sum\nmarized on these data sheets for use in this payload interface study. T\ndata sheets are on file at Aerospace. The interface equipment needs\nderived in the references are summarized in Section 4. 2.\n4. 2\t\n\n_DOD\n\nON -LINE ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT NEEDS LIST\n\nThe on-line ancillary equipment needs for the six DoD payloads studied by DoD contractors, plus the radioisotope thermoelectric\ngenerator (RTG), are checked off in Table 4-1. The equipment is listed\nas well as the DoD study in which it is applicable. The satellites to\nwhich each of the equipments apply are indicated on the table. As can\nbeen seen from the table, many of the equipments apply to several\nsatellites, suggesting that there is a potential for common equipments\nacross several of the -satellite programs.\n\nt\n\nE\n\na\n1\t\n\n3\n\n4-Z\t\n\ny\n\nm\n\nTable 4-1.

These interface needs are listed in\nSection 4.2. The second condition is that the MMSE item be recommended by NASA for further effort, either additional study or definition\nand new start. Table 5-1 lists the MMSE described in the MMSE\'\nCatalog (Reference 1) and indicates which of the conditions each\nequipment satisfies. Each equipment which has a "yes" in both of the\ntwo right-hand columns was assessed for applicability to DoD payloads.\nIf the equipment was needed by DoD but not on the NASA proposed\nlist, it would normally also be assessed to see if its application was\ngeneral enough to. make a recommendation to NASA that the equipment\nbe given further consideration.\nTable 5-2 relates the DoD interface equipment need from\nTable 4-1 to the candidate 1 ASA MMSE listed in Table 5-1.

The main\nfindings of this study are listed below.\n1,.\t\n2.\n\ni^\nj\n\n;I\n\nFor transitioning DoD payloads it is feasible to use\nMMSE to standardize the payload/IUS interface.\t This\nstandardization of the interface furnishes a new justification for payload/IUS support MMSE.\t With this\nstandardization comes the capability to fly payloads\neither singly or in multiples while maintaining the\nsame payload interface.\t Thus the DoD payloads can\nbe combined with each other or with non -DOD payloads\nup to (a) the limits of the performance capability of\nthe IUS, (b) the load carrying capability of the MMSE,\nand (c) the payload volume available forward of the\nIUS as it is mounted in the orbiter payload bay.\n\n3.\n\nIt is recommended that NASA consider modification\nof Payload Spacer XPLS-3 to a larger diameter to\naccommodate DoD payloads efficiently in a tandem\nmounting.\n\n4.\n\nIt is recommended that NASA consider a payload spacer\'\nof the XPLS-3 type but of a shorter length to accommodate a combination of the DSP and DSCS payloads\nsharing a IUS flight.\n\n5.\n\nj\n\nMultiple GPS payloads sharing one IUS flight are planned\nand can use MMSE IUS/payload interface equipments.\n\nIt is recommended that NASA consider modification\nof the side-by-side payload beam XPMB-1 to a smaller\ndiameter to obtain adequate rattlespace in the payload\nbay.\t Three or four side-by-side payloads (instead of\ntwo) should also be considered.\nIt is recommended that NASA consider MMSE providing\nfor tandem mounting ,,(of up to three decks) of -side-byside payloads mounted on payload beam XPMB-1 (modified).\n\nt^\n\nk!\n^I\n5-12\n\nThe MMSE data sheets listing the satellites whip\nDoD users are presented in Section 5.2.2.\n5.2.2\t\n\nMMSE Data Sheets\n\nMMSE Data Sheets pertaining to IUS/payload su,\npresented on pages 5-15 through 5-34.\n5.3\t\n\nORBITER PAYLOAD_ SUPPORT\n\n5. 3. 1\t\n\nSummary\n\nThe DoD interface study contractors considered\npayload supports in the orbiter payload bay. It was also \xc2\xad\xc2\xad.\xe2\x80\x94 LXl\nthe remote manipulator system and payload support arms would be\nadequate for payload deployment and/or retrieval when required. If\none or more of the DoD payload projects required that the payload by\ndeployable under 1 g conditions (for test purposes), additional equipments would be required; however, no MMSE is proposed for this\nfunction,\nThe DMSP and one other DoD satellite would use the General\nPurpose Platform for support in the orbiter payload bay. The General\nPurpose Platform could also support the RTG-Cooling Unit during flight.\nThe General Purpose Platform is therefore recommended as a potential\ncommon MMSE item for DOD and NASA.\n\n.\t\n\nA Center of Gravity Ballast Kit, a non-MMSE item, is\nrequired for the SOSS-satellite. An end effector on the remote manipulator system capable of connecting an umbilical to the payload is needed\nfor the DMSP and SOSS satellite projects. This also is a non-MMSE\ninterface equipment.\n\ni\n\nF\t\n\nThe study reported in Reference 7 called out a shroud for the\nDSP satellite while it was mounted in the payload bay as a potential requirement. It is possible that the shroud would not be needed if local dust covers\nprotected the individual critical areas on the spacecraft and other means\nwere used to either reduce the sound pressure level or requalify the spacecraft components for the increased sound pressure level. The use\nof a common shroud has additional advantages which should be considered.\nFor instance, it affords protection from contaminants from flight sharing\npayloads and would protect the orbiter payload from reentry debris\nduring abort. Protection would also be provided against orbiter RCS\nplume impingement and contamination of the spacecraft. \t\n\n1\n\nIt is recommended that the shroud be studied further as a\nMMSE item. The possibility of use of the same shroud with other payloads such as the DMSP (no IUS) and the options to make the shroud\nmodular and capable of return and reuse should be studied,\nThe MMSE Data Sheets listing the satellites to which orbiter\t\npayload support equipment are applicable are presented in Section 5. 3. 2.\n5.3.2\t\n\nT\n\nMMSE Data Sheets\n{\n\nMMSE Data Sheets pertaining to orbiter payload support are\npresented on pages 5-35 through 5-51.\n\ni\n\ny\n\n5-14\n\n\t\nj\n^\t\n\n1\n\nIUS/Payload Support MMSE Data Sheet\n\n330-03-08-01-07.\nIDENTIFICATION NO.\t\nPayload Interface Adapter (PIA-2)\nNAME\t\nDATE\nAUTOMATEDO\t\nAUTO W IUS\nSORTIE q\t\nCATEGORY:\t\nOTHER[]\nCREW RELATED\t\nx\t\nAUTO W TUG[]\n5.

Current IUS studies of payloads cantilevered\nfrom the IUS mounted in the cargo bay have shown that high\ntransverse loading; conditions in the payload result during ascent\nand landing with a cantileverer mount arrangement. The APS-1\nis not considered to be a suitable means of payload support\nfor payloads which would encounter high dynamic loads as a\nresult of cantilever mounting. In these cases, the payload\nshould be mounted on a cradle such as UPC-l. Shorter, stiffer\npayloads could make use of the APS-1.\nNeither of the two Low Earth Orbit (LEO) DOD spacecraft under\nconsideration for this study are candidates for use with the\nAPS-1. The DMSP can be mounted on the GPP-1. The combined\nlength of the SOSS, APS-1, and PMB-2 is 59 feet. The cargo\nbay, with the OMS kit installed, cannot accommodate the 59-foot\nlength. While the GPP has been identified for use with the\nDMSP, the APS-1 or the UPC couldalso be considered as candidate support structures for the DMSP,\n\n5-39\n\n1\n\nOrbiter Payload Support MMSE Data Sheet\n330-03-09-03\nIDENTIFICATION NO.\t\nNAME Tilt Table (TT-1)\nDATE\nCATEGORY:\t\nSORTIE q\t\nAUTOMATED\t\nAUTO W IUS q\nAUTO W TUG[]\t\nCREW RELATED[]\t\nOTHERq\n5.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nAs a result of trying to use the APS-1 with PIA.-3, PMB-2,\nand SLP-1 to support the 112-inch diameter by 53-feet long\nSOSS while leaving space for the OMS kit, a length interference\nwas discovered. Also, cantilever support of such a long, heavy\npayload from the APS-1 is questionable due to the dynamic\nexcursions and possible high loads which could be incurred.\nTherefore, a method of supporting long payloads by using a\nUniversal Payload Cradle is recommended as added MMSE.\nThe cradle is fabricated in segments with attach fittings spaced \t\n\n59 inches on center to mate with the orbiter payload bay attach\npoints. Two segments are used: (l) the basic segment is approximatcly,64 inches long and has three primary fittings plus provision for a fourth stabilizing fitting, and (2) additional segments\nare 59 inches long and contain provisions for a fourth stabilizing\nfitting which would replace the stabilizing fitting on the basic\nsegment. Either the basic cradle segment can be used alone\nto support a payload or additional length can be gained by bolting\nadditional segments onto the basic segment.\n\n5-49\n\ni\n\na\n\nj\n\nl\n\nr\n^\n\n\'\n\nf\n^\t\n\n1\n\nOrbiter Payload Support MMSE Data Sheet\nUniversal Payload Cradle (UPC-1, -2) (Cont\'d)\t\n\n3\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION (Cont\'d)\n\ni\n\nThe Universal Payload Cradle is fashioned after the special\npullets used for sortie missions.

The\ndata sheets were reviewed to determine compatibility of the unit with\nDoD payloads.\nThe unit as described consists of a water circulant/water\nevaporant system. Water in a closed loop circulates through the coolant\njackets encapsulating the RTGs and is in turn cooled by passing (1)\nthrough a GSE heat exchanger during ground operations prior to .launch,\nand (2) through a supplementary heat exchanger which uses stored\nwater for flash evaporation during all other phases of the mission.\n5.4.2\t\n\nMMSE and Orbiter Characteristics\n\nThe DoD payload with the maximum heat generation is the\nLES 8-9-9 with 6 RTGs (each LES satellite has 2 RTGs). Each RTG\ngenerates 2400 watts or 8200 Btu/hr so that the total heat rejection\nrate is 49.2 K Btu/hr. For a 15 hour mission, the total heat rejected\nis 738 K Btu, and the maximum amount of stored water is 738 lb.\nTotal heat rejected is:\n\n\';\t\n\n1.\t\nZ.\t\n3.\t\n\n58 K Btu minimum\n246 K Btu nominal\n738 K Btu maximum.\nr\n\n5 -52\n\n\t\ni\na\n\nThe orbiter heat rejection capability is as follows.\n1.\n\nDoors closed (ascent and reentry): ?. 2 K Btu/hr is\nprovided by theorbiter flash evaporator above100 K\naltitude and by the orbiter ammonia boiler below 100 K.\n\n7..\t\n\nDoors open (on orbit): 21.5 K Btu/hr baseline heat\nrejection capability through the use of six radiator\npanels mounted on the doors. Two additional (payload\nchargeable) radiator panels can be mounted on the\naft doors,, increasing the capability to 29 K Btu/hr.\n\nThe sketch of the cooling system (under RTG Cooling Units\nItem 8, p. 99, Reference 1) does not show connections to a GSE heat\nexchanger even though one is called out under Item 23.,\n5. 4. 3\t\n\nComments on the Selected System\n\n\'I\'he water/water system, as described in References l and 15,\nhas several dr,lwbacks.\nL.\t\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\nThe system does not take advantage of the capability\nof the orbiter, radiator panels on orbit with doors open.\nA dual mode of operation (a) water boiler when doors\nare closed, (b) orbiter radiator when doors are open,\ncould reduce the evaporant weight requirement considerably since, according to mission timelines, most\nof the RTG cooling takes place while the doors are\nopen.\nThere is a possibility of payload contamination by the\nwater vapor vented while the doors are open. The\ndual mode discussed above eliminates this problem\nfor payloads rejecting heat at rates below the radiator \t\ncapacity available for payload cooling.\nDepending on the orientation of the orbiter, there is\na possibility that the water lines will freeze, after\nRTG/payload deployment. If Freon is used as the\nclosed-loop circulant, this problem is eliminated.\n\na\n\n\'t\n\nt.\n\n5-53\n\nI\n\na\n\n\t\n\n5.4.4\t\n\nComments on the Need for an RTG Coolant Jacket\n\nThe ground rule for the Martin Marietta study was that an\nexisting RTG should be used for this study.

The Shuttle power applied\ncan be adequate for both the IUS and payloads. Spacecraft solar arrays\nwithout panels deployed are expected to be adequate during the IUS\ninjection phase. The possibility that one or more of the spacecraft\nmay need the auxiliary power unit as a backup power supply to the\norbiter power needs to be studied. Unless this latter case developes,\nthe auxiliary power unit does not appear to be required for DoD spacecraft.\nThe orbiter/payload service cabling and J-box (IUS deployed)\nMMSE item 05-03, provides inconnecting electrical conductors between\nthe Shuttle service panels and junction box on or adjacent to the cradle\nsupporting the IUS and IUS deployed spacecraft. The circuit capacity\nof about 80 wire pairs may be about right for the IUS or DSP spacecraft but may be too low for dual launches such as those planned for\nDSCS. It can also be applied to the DMSP and SOSS satellites. Therefore,\nit is recommended that the descripter on this cabling unit drop the\n"IUS deployed" designation since the equipment can be applied to nonIUS payloads.\nPayload umbilical cabling , (IUS deployed), MMSE item 05-04,\nprovides electrical conductors between the junction boxes for MMSE \t\nitem 05-03 and the umbilical connectors. It is potentially applicable\nto the same DoD spacecraft.\n\n-\xc2\xb1\n\nThe orbiter /payload service cabling and J-box, MMSE item\n05-01, is not applicable to DoD spacecraft in its current configuration.\nWith 195 wire pairs, , it has excessive capacity and sacrifices too much\n\n5-57\t\n\n1\n\nr\n\nt\n\nf\n\nweight chargeable to the payload. However, it could be modified so\nthat it would be applicable to DoD payloads sharing the orbiter payload\nbay. A lower capacity basic unit with a add-a-cable approach is\nrecommended.\nAll DoD payloads require integration equipment to isolate\nor condition orbiter power for spacecraft usage. A description is\nincluded for an isolation power supply for consideration as a possible \t\nMMSE item.\n\ni\n\nDoD payloads will also require a safety control system for\nboth, the IUS and the spacecraft. A description of a unit described\nas "electrical conditioning and distribution assembly" is included and\nrecommended for consideration as a possible MMSE item.\n5. 5. 2\t\n\nMMSE Data Sheets\n\nThe MMSE Data Sheets pertaining to electrical/avionics\nsupport are presented on pages 5-59 through 5-66.\n\nI\n\n1\n\ni\ni\n\na\n\nF\n7\n\nG\n\n5-58\n\n\t\n\nElectrical/Avionics Support MMSE Data Sheet\n330-03-01-02\n1.

All of\nthe DoD payloads ( except the RTG) use hydrazine as a monopropellant\nand nitrogen as a pressurant.\nThe FSC, SOSS, and GPS utilize isolation valves between\nthe propellant tanks and thrusters which can provide redundant propellant leakage protection. The rest of the DoD payloads require the\naddition of isolation valves to provide redundant protection against\nleakage from thrustervalves or from mechanical connections to thruster\nvalve inlets,\n(1) These lines are used as a set when required for IUS- launched payloads.\n\n5-69\n\nk\tr\t\n\ni\no\nt\t\n3\n\nt\n\n\t\n\nt\n\nb\n\ni\nE\n\nOrbiter-Deployed Payloads:\n\nPayload Umbilical Support Structure (MMSE)--\n\nShuttle-Deployed Payload\n\nOrbiter Preflight Service Panel \t\n(Near Side)\nOrbiter/Payload Service\nLines (MMSE)\n\ni\n\n3---03-07-01\nI\nx\n\nOrbiter Service Panel (X o 1307)\n\ni\n\nFigure 5-1.

The NASA payload\nstation equipment includes cathode ray tubes . for dynamic display, a\nIr.(^ybonrd for operator interaction with the electronics unit controlling\ndisplays, and a hard copy unit. The DoD satellite interface studies\n\nshowed the need for on-board equipment to assist in payload downlink testing, a spacecraft control panel, safety support equipment,\nand spacecraft checkout. However, as this study was underway, the\nUSAF directive for minimum satellite/orbiter interface approaches\nwas made and. it was assumed that one of the interpretations of this\nAli rective would be a deletion of any payload specialist station equiprrient in the near term.\n\n5. 8\t\n\nLAUNCH SITE MMSE\n\n5.8. 1\t\n\nIntroduction\n\nReference 2 identified several items of ground support\nequipment which had multiple use applicability to. NASA KSC payloads\ndestined for launch by the Space Transportation System (STS). Following the Martin study completion, certain of the items were selected\nby the KSC Payload Integration Office and recommendi\xe2\x80\x9ed to NASA Headquarters for further consideration. These items have been assessed\nfor similar applicabilit), to DoD payloads scheduled for Shuttle Launches.\n5.8.2\t\n\nApproach\n\nEach of the MMSE items were separately examined to determine if their functional and performance characteristics would satisfy\nthe support requirements of those payloads identified in the DoD Space\nMission Model, Revision 4. Where neces-nary, rational projections\nof requirements were made for those payloads which have not progressed\nbeyond the planning stage. Both KSC and VAFB launched programs\nwere included.\nThe Martin study assigned categories to the various MMSE\t\ncandidates, e. g. , Category A for required.- items, Category B for\' proposed items, and Category C for optional items. Only the first\ntwo were carried through their analysis to,a determination of applicability to specific payloads. This DoD evaluation was consequently\nlimited to consideration of only those Category .A and B items. The\noptional Cat-egoty C MMSE can be analyze.d\'for DoD applicability in\nfollow-oti effort as NASA identifies desirable candidates from that\n\n1\n\n9roL7l?.\t\n1\ni\n\nP\nQUA IS\nI\n\nORIGZVAZ\nOF\nPOOR\n\n}\n\n5-84-\n\ny\n\nr\n\nThe support equipment assembly known as Interface Verification Equipment (IVE), or Shuttle Integration Device (SID), was added\nto the MMSE list and evaluated. The definitive reference was that\ndescribed by Rockwell International in their briefing package "Interface\nVerification Equipment Study (NAS 9-14000CCA-140)-IVE Concept,\ndated May 5, 1975, As the information is conceptual, a certain amount\nof latitude was taken in attributing to the equipment characteristics\nthe full intent of the unit\'s purpose, i. e. , to be a "standard set of hardware representing the Shuttle flight article with regard to fit, form,\nand function to accept a payload. " (Briefing by R. T. Everline, Payload\nCoordination Office, "Interface Verification Equipment Study Overview,\nNASA-S-75-15.15 A, Ma}, 5, 1975. )\n5.8.3\t\n\nGro und Rul es and Assumptions\n\nThe lack of detail, both in the MMSE specifications and in\nsome of the payload.s, and the unique processing constraints imposed\nby the Shuttle system ., necessitated the establishment_ of DoD-peculiar\nqualifying ground rules and assumptions. These supplement those\nidentified by Martin in their Revision 1 to the MMSE Catalogue (Launch\nSite), February 1975, and were as follows:\n1\t .\n\nDoD payloads will be installed for flight in the orbiter\non-pad at VAFB. At KSC, the DoD installations will\nbe primarily in the payload changeout room, but installation in the orbiter processing facility is not ruled\nout:\n\n2.\n\nWhere not specifically defined, , launch site MMSE\ncapacities,\ncompatible\nands otherc it cal characteristics will becompat\nP\nwith the DoD payload requirements,\n\n3.\n\nSufficient quantities of the MMSE will be provided\nto service DoD needs, both at KSC and VAFB.\n\n5_.85\n\n.i\n\np\t\n\nf\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\nTug and IUS-peculiar support requirements are not\nincluded in this assessment although the potential is\nnoted in some cases.\n\n6.\n\nAs some payloads will be flown in a shared or multip7\nlaunch, the annual applicability rate identifies only\nthe numbers of payloads launched and not necessarily\nthe number of Shuttle launches.\n\n7.\n\nSpacecraft processing at KSC will be conducted in the\nCCAFS SAB, SAEF No. 1 or in the PCR.\n\n8.\n\nPayload designs will withstand loads imposed by handling\nand transportation in either vertical or horizontal\norientation, based on the strength requirements of\nreturn and abort landings.\n\n9.\n\n5.8.4\t\n\nPayloads will be designed, or modified, to be compatible with the STS characteristics as specified in\nNASA publications JSC-07700, Volume XIV, Space\nShuttle System Payload Accommodations, Change 10,\nand K-SM-14, KSC Launch Site Accommodations\nHandbook for STS Payloads, Revision 1. Any excepti\nwill be rectified by MMSE or payload- supplied equipn\n\nApplicability is based on "potential application."\nPotential application for MMSE GSE to a DoD payload\nmeans that there is a reasonable expectation that the\nrequirement for the equipment will develop by the\nShuttle era.\n\nDoD Applicability of,NASA-Launch Site \'MMSE\n\nThirteen items of the candidate MMSE were found to have\nDoD applicability. Table 2-3 (Section 2, -pages 2-7 and 2-8 of this\nreport) summarizes the assessments in matrix form with indications of\nfirst need date for DoD, launch site assignment, total number of payload\nlaunches, and other pertinent data. (The table is supported by the\nindividual MMSE data sheets presented on pages 5-92 through 5-110.) \t\n\ny\n\nr\n\na\n\n5-86\n\n1\n\nTlie IVE analysis was based on the expanded description\ngiven in Section 5. 8. 5. It should be noted that the assessment is only\ntentative and a considerable expansion of capabilities and functions\nwould be necessary before DoD acceptability could be further considered.\nAmong the unidentified provisions are crew indoctrination and training,\nfinal positioning and c. g. verifications, and the ability to conduct\nelectrical power disconnect and reconnect.\nThe six items for which applicability was not identified\nmay have applicability when the payload designs become more definitive.\nI\n\nThe applicability assessments cannot be construed as DoD\ncommitments.

PAYLOAD/IUS INTERFACE (MMSE) STRUCTURE STUDY\n\nFifteen of the MMSE items selected as candidates for\n\napplication to DoD payloads fall into the category of payload/IUS interface equipments. These include adapters, mounting beams, spacers,\nservice- plates, and a separation latch and push - off assembly. Of\nthe 12 DoD payloads considered, nine require an IUS. Several of these\nnine payloads will be transitioning to the IUS from Transtage. Currently\nthe IUS physical interface with the payload is the Transtage interface.\nIf these payloads were to fly singly on IUS, i. e., not share the IUS\nflight with another payload, the physical Transtage interface could be\nused without MMSE assuming that the interface loads and umbilical\nrequirements are compatible. However, there is an excess payload\n\nf\n\nweight capability available in the generic IUS performance map for all\nDoD synchronous equatorial payloads if flown singly. The MMSE\nis designed to support multiple payloads on the IUS. The payload/IUS\ninterface structure in the MMSE catalog also has the effect of standardizing the interface so that payloads could be flown singly (with ballast)\nor sharing the IUS flight without changing the interface or payload\nsupport. If the MMSE IUS payload interface equipments are accepted\nand used, payload flight sharing is enhanced by having payload interchangeability not only between DoD payloads but also NASA payloads.\nA brief conceptv.al study was made to identify the MMSE\nwhich would be used in this situation on DoD payloads. Since in this\nstudy the applications of interest are those which occur early in the\nShuttle era, only the IUS (pre-Tug) equipment is considered. MMSE\ndescribed in the catalog is used directly wheneverpossible. If modifications in the MMSE could either enhance their applicability to DoD\n\n6-1\n\nbilk\n\n1\n\n9\n\npayloads or extend their application to additional payloads, the modifications which would accomplish this are described.\nFor this task an IUS which uses solid rocket propellant\nengines in a two-stage configuration wasconsidered. In the case of the\npayload mounting beam, it was assumed that the payload spacer will \t\nseparate from the beam by means of explosive bolts. The separation\nmechanism was not described in the catalog. Discussions with Martin\nMarietta resulted in the assumptions for , this, study.\t\n\n!w\n\n{\n\nj\n\n` f\t\n\nIUS payload configurations studied were: (1) DSCS payload\non IUS, ( 2) DSCS payloads in tandem on IUS, (3) DSP (1) payload on IUS,\n(4) DSCS plus DSP (l ) payloads in tandem on IUS, (5) FSC payload -on IUS;.\n(6) two FSC payloads in tandem on IUS`, (7) FSC and DSCS. payloads in\n6\ntandem on IUS, and (8) four GPS payloads on IUS, tandem and side-by- \t\nside.\n\'\t\n\nI\t\n\nThe study consisted of three tasks: \t\n1.\n\nFor the multiple configurations where orbiter payload \t\nbay dimensional constraints could , b-e^ a .problem,\nconceptual layouts were made of the IUS plus payloads\n\n3.\n\ni\t\n\n1\n\nI\n\nSelect the MMSE which could be applied and accomplish\na design weight statement summarizing the IUS pay-load weights with MMSE -included\n\n2.\n\n1\n\nModifying MMSE concepts to be more compatible\nwith multiple_DoD payloads.\n\nc\n1\n\nThe application of MMSE to DoD\'payloads for this IUS/\npayload interface structure study was accomplished us ng \xe2\x80\xa2;; the .application\n\nrules described on Page 95 of Reference 15 The payload- definitions\nused were those from References 6 through 10. This first-cut at: the\nc\n\n{\n\n(1) Without payload shroud.\t\n\n6-2\n\nN\t\n\napplications resulted in the design described by i \xe2\x80\xa2he weight statement\nshown. in Tables 6-l., 6-2, and 6-3. These data show that 227 or 318 kg\n(500 or 700 lb) can be saved by going from. the 4. 5 m (176 in) diameter\nspacer ( see Table 6-1) to the smaller diameter spacer for the multiple\npayloads. However, the DoD payloads which the spacer fits over are\n2.67 to 2.78 m (105 to 109.4 in) in diameter. The 3.0 m (120 in)\ndiameter spacer currently described in the MMSE list might work for\nthe 2. 67 m (i05 in) diameter payload but is too small a diameter for\nthe other payloads. It is therefore recommended (and Table 6-2 data\nreflects) that the 3. 0 m (120 in) spacer be increased to 3. 5 m (138 in).\n\nI\n\ni\n\nThe length was maintained at 4. 3 m (170 in) so that the applicability\nto the NASA mission model estimated by Martin would remain valid.\n\nx\t\n\nFor the configuration supporting DSP and DSCS in. tandem,\nttie 4. 3 m ( 170 in) long spacer required the payload package to exceed\nthe length. of the payload bay available to it. A shortened version of\ntfic spacer (XI\'LS-3) is therefore recommended -for consideration by\nNASA as a possible MMSE item (see Table 6-2 and Figure 6-1). If\na payload shroud is needed for DSP ( see pages 5-14, 5- 35) the integration of a shroud into the multiple payload configuration for DSP needs\nto be studied.\nThe FSC and DSCS-lI payloads in tandem configuration is shown\nin Figure 6-2. The 4. 3 m (170 in) long sp=tG: er. is shown. The DSCS\nplus DSP payloads in tandem are shown in F-.^gurc 6-1. The shortened\nspacer [3. 3 m (130 in) long version} is shown. Four GPS satellites\nmounted, on the IUS, again using MMSE, are shown in Figure 6-3.\nIn order to obtain rattle room in this configuration., the 4. 5 m (176 in)\ndiameter beam described in the MMSE catalog for payload mounting\nbeam XPMB- l (side:-by-side payloads) was inadequate.: The diameter\nof the payload mounting beam shown in the figure has been reduced.\t\nORi\n\nOP\n\nL\n\nPAGE\t IS\nPoo"?

In addition, the 2235 kg\n(4928 lb) payload weight shown in Figure 6 -3 for this configuration is\nvery low compared to the capability of the IUS to the GPS destination.\n[greater than 4082 kg (9000 lb)]. It is recommended that NASA consider\npayload spacers in combination with the side-by-side payload mounting\nbeam so that three or four side-by -side payload mounting beams could\nbe configured to fly on the IUS with six or eight payloads. It is also\nrecommended that NASA consider increasing the number of payloads\naccommodated on each side-by-side payload mounting beam so that up\nto four payloads could be mounted on one beam.\nThe sequence of events for deployment of the multiple\npayloads on IUS is illustrated below using the FLEETSATCOM (FSC)\nand DSCS multiple payload configuration (see Figure 6-2).\n1.\n2.\n\nThe FSC is deployed by the latch and push-off\nmechanism (SLP-I). This action also disconnects \t\nand separates the payload service plates (PSP-1, -2).\n\n3.\n\nThe payload mounting beam (XPMB-2) which supports\nFSC is separated by blowing explosive bolts holding\nit by the spacer (XPLS-3).\n\n4.\n\n-\t\n\nIUS terminates powered flight in a phasing orbit\nat the geosynchronous 24-hour satellite destination.\n\nThe DSCS-II satellite is separated from the payload\nmounting beam supporting it by the latch and pushoff mechanism (SLP-1). Again, the payload service\nplates between DSCS and the IUS are separated by\nthis action. The DSCS satellite separation velocity\ndrives the satellite out through the spacer opening.\n\na\nd\n\na\n\n6-15\nPRECEDING PAGE\n\nBLANK NOT FTL ,\nMID\n\n\t\n!\t\n\nMultiple payloads boosted to 24-hour synchronous orbit\nfor DoD can use the IUS/payload interface equipments if the IUS capability\nto synchronous equatorial orbit is 1769 kg (3900 lb) or more. The\nfollowing capacities are required:\n1.\n\nTwo DSCS satellites, 1769 to 1951 kg (3900 lb-to\n4300 lb)\n\n2.\n\nOne DSCS plus one FSC, 1951 kg , to 2540 kg ( 4300 lb:\nto 5600 lb)\n\n3. ; One DSCS plus one DSP, 2177 kg to 2676 kg (4800 lb\nto 5900 lb)\nTwo FSC satellites, 2268 kg to 2858 kg (5000 lb\nto 6300 lb),\nThese multiple payload configurations assume the MMSE payload spacer\ndiameter XPMB-2 has been modified.- Thus, for DoD payloads transitioning\nfrom expendable launch vehicles to the Shuttle/IUS, it is feasible to\nuse MMSE to standardize the payload/IUS interface.\n\n4.\t\n\nFor carrying multiple GPS payloads on the IUS, the IUS\nperformance to the GPS orbit will be at least 4082 kg (9000 lb) payload.\nThus the GPS is expected to be compatible with MMSE for launching\nup. to four GPS without modification of the MMSE and could be compatible\n\nwith MMSE modified as previously discussed in this section-for up to\neight payloads.\nThe potential operational advantages for IUS configurations\nusing standardized MMSE interface equipment needs more study:\nPotential advantages for this approach include-(1) the flexibility `to\t\nsubstitute; payloads on a multiple payload configuration,. (2) reduction\nin integration costs; and time,, and (3) in the far term, if a upper stage\npayload retrieval capability is developed.; . standardizingthe interface\nwill make it feasible to deploy-one payload.and retrieve another on the \t\nsame interface equipment.\n,\nd\n\nd\n\nr\n\n6\xe2\x80\x94i6\n\n3\n\n)\n\nr\n\n7. SUMMARY OF STUDY ACCOMPLISHMENTS\nThe data bank on which this study was based was extensive\n(see reference list, Section 9). Both the systems analysts and the\nspecialists working on this study were required to familarize themselves with the material contained in most of the references as it\npertained to their particular area. Each was required to understand\nthe definition and use of the MMSE, the satellites to which the equipments were being applied, the STS side of the interface, and the interface equipment needs for each of the satellites studied.\nThe study was accomplished by carrying out the following\nsteps.\n1.\n\nRelate the DoD satellite and interface data available\nto the DoD Space Mission Model.\n\n2.\n\nThe DoD payload interface study data for the Global\nPositioning Satellite (GPS), DSCS-II, Defense Support\nProgram (DSP), FleetSatCom (FSC), Defense Meteorological Support Program (DMSP), SOSS, and a Radio\nIsotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) were collected\nand the data from the reports summarized. Payload\nData Sheets were completed describing each of the\npayloads as they were configured for the payload interface studies. There data sheets are on file at The\nAerospace Corporation. The DoD airborne ancillary\nequipment needed to support the satellites studied were\nlisted and briefly described.\nNone of the reported studies covered launch site or\t\nground support equipment.\n\n3.\n\nMMSE lists were made up containing all the MMSE from\nthe two catalogs (References \'1 and 2). These equipment lists were paired down by eliminating equipments\nnot recommended by MSFC or KSC for further consideration by NASA.\n\n7-1\n\n=r\n\nj\n\n4.\n\nThe NASA launch site MMSE was studied for application\nto each of 12 DoD payloads in the Space Mission Model.\n\n5.\n\nEach equipment on the on-line or airborne MMSE list was\nconsidered against the on-line interface equipment needs\nfor each of the DoD satellites.\t This resulted in a list of\ncandidate MMSE to be studied for -application to the DoD\npayloads.\t For each piece of equipment studied, a MMSE\nData Sheet was completed listing the DoD satellites to\nwhich the equipment was potentially applicable and discussing the rationale for its use.\n\n6.\n\nA conceptual design mass properties and layout analysis\nof the payload/IUS interface (MMSE) structure was\naccomplished.\t The best combination of MMSE for\nsupporting multiple payloads on the IUS was derived\nusing the application rules described on Page 95 of Reference-15.\t Layouts were made of the three most complex\npayload installations on the IUS.\n\n7.\n\nA design concept effort of the universal cradle/tilt table\nconcepts was accomplished.\t Other orbiter/payload interface structures, such as platforms and payload support\nracks, were also considered.\n\n8.\n\nMMSE application studies based on the contractor recommended requirements for each of the DoD satellite\ninterfaces were accomplished in the following areas:\n\n_._\n\n-\n\na.\t\n\nFluid lines and purging\n\nd.\t\n\nR TG cooling\n\ne.\t\n9.\n\nAuxiliary power units\n\nc.\t\n\nE\n\nCabling for avionics and power\n\nb.\t\n\ni\n\nPayload shroud.\n\nThe results obtained for interface equipment application\nto the six DoD satellites studied was extrapolated where\npossible to the remaining six satellites studiable in the\nDoD Space Mission Model.\t Where similarity existed\nbetween the six additional satellites and those studied,\nsimilarity was used to access the applicability of each\nequipment to the additional satellite.\n\n7-2\n\nI\n\n10.\n\nThe ancillary equip\nin the NASA MMSE\nto whether recomn\nto include addition;\nstudies.\n\nneeded by DoD but not included\nreviewed for consideration as\nbons sha ,^ d be made to NASA\nillary equipment in future MMSE\n\n11.\n\nThe results of the\nrnarized and discus\nMSFC, and SAMSC\n\nLary Equipment Study were sumwith NASA Headquarters, NASA\nospace.\n\nl\n\n8. RECOMMEND.\n\nThe need for additional etiort in the ancillary equipment area\nstems from two concerns: (1) the ancillary equipment needs for DoD\t\n\npayloads are changing, both as a result of DoD guidelines and directives\nand as a result of improved definitions of the STS satellite configurations\nand the STS itself; (2) NASA is continuing with definition studies and\napplication analyses to NASA payloads for the MMSE (NASA is expected\nto redefine MMSE in several of the areas); and (3) assessment of the\njustification for MMSE application to DoD satellites needs to be made\nby comparing the use of MMSE with alternate equipment.\ni\n\nSince in FY 1976 Martin Marietta will be redefining MMSE\nin the following areas which may have application to DoD payloads,\nit is recommended that these redefined MMSE be reviewed to find\npotential DoD uses:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n\nE\t\n\nC\n8-1\n\nIis\ni\t\n\nAttitude reference sensors\nElectrical power equipment\nElectrical cabling\nR TG cooling unit\nPayload shroud\nPurge system\nIUS to payload interface structure\nOrbiter to payload interface structure\nOn-orbit servicing equipment.\n\nThe MMSE that is applicable to DoD payloads should then be\nevaluated by comparing cost, weight, and operational advantages with\nalternative approaches.\n\nf\n\nI\t\n\nj\n\n\'\n\nj\n\n9.
