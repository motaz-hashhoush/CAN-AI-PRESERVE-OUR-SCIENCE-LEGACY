The investigations were carried out to form a comparison database for future studies of protein crystal growth in the  microgravity environment of space. A diffusion-convection model is presented for predicting crystal growth rates in the presence of solutal concentration gradients. Techniques used to grow and monitor the growth of hen egg white lysozyme are detailed. The model calculations and experiment data are employed to discuss the effects of transport and interfacial kinetics in the growth of the crystals, which gradually diminished the free energy in the growth solution. Density gradient-driven convection, caused by presence of the gravity field, was a limiting factor in the growth rate.", "title": "Protein crystal growth - Growth kinetics for tetragonal lysozyme crystals", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T03:06:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870026596, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pusey, M.
