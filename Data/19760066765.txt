Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad were in flight\n190 hours and 56 minutes, nearly eight days).\n\n2.\n\nThe first space rendezvous of two manned maneuverable\n\nspacecraft.\n\n-more-\n\n11/23/65\n\n-2-\n\n3.\n\nA minimum turn-around time for launch of two missions\n\nfrom the same pad.\n\nDespite the rendezvous objective of Gemini 6, the two\nmissions will be carried out independently. That is, Gemini 7\nwill be launched and carried out as originally planned.\n\nNo\n\nmajor changes have been made in the Gemini 7 flight plan.\n\nThe Gemini 6 mission will be carried out according to a\nflight plan which is nearly identical to the one prepared for\nthe Oct. 25 launch which was postponed when the Agena Target\nVehicle failed to achieve orbit.\n\nThe only major change is that\n\nthe Gemini 6 spacecraft was to have docked with the Agena.\n\nIn the forthcoming flight, the two Gemini spacecraft will\nnot be physically connected.\n\nIt was decided that the planned schedule of Gemini 7 and the\navailability of the Gemini 6 launch vehicle and spacecraft\n(already checked out on Pad 19) presented an opportunity to\ncarry out a rendezvous of two manned vehicles.\n\n-more-\n\n-3The first several days of the Gemini 7 mission will be\ndevoted to carrying out experiments.\n\nAt about five days the\n\ncrew will maneuver the spacecraft into a target orbit for\nGemini 6.\n\nDuring the rendezvous attempt by Gemini 6, the\n\nGemini 7 crew will maintain their orbit and spacecraft attitude,\nperforming only those maneuvers required to make themselves a\nbetter target.\n\nFollowing a successful liftoff, Gemini 6 immediately will\nbegin maneuvers to achieve rendezvous which is planned for its\nfourth orbit.\n\nFollowing rendezvous, Gemini 6 will station keep\n\n(fly formation) on Gemini 7 for about two revolutions. Subsequently, Gemini 7 will fly formation on Gemini 6 for one spacecraft day, about 40 minutes.\n\nGemini 6 will reenter the Earth\'s atmosphere and land In the\nWest Atlantic Ocean after about 46 hours and 45 minutes, at approximately 8:20 a.m. EST.\n\nGemini 7 duration will be about 329 hours and 30 minutes,\nlanding in the same area at approximately 8 a.m. EST, two days\nlater.\n\n(BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOLLOWS)\n-more-\n\n-4LAUNCH VEHICLE COUNTDOWN\n\nGemini T\nP-3 days\n\nStart pre-count\n\nF-l day\n\nStart mid-count\n\nT-12 hours\n\nGLV propellant loading\n\nT-390 minutes\n\nComplete propel 1 ant loading\n\nT-300 minutes\n\nBegin terminal countdown\n\nT-120 minutes\n\nFlight Crew to Complex 19\n\nT-100 minutes\n\nT-75 minutes\n\nCrew enters spacecraft\ni\nClose spacecraft hatches\n\nT-50 minutes\n\nWhite Room evacuation\n\nT-35 minutes\n\nBegin erector levering\n\nT-15 minutes\n\nSpacecraft OAMS static firing\n\nT-04 seconds\n\nGLV ignition\n\nT-0 seconds\n\nLiftoff\n\nT+2 minutes, 36 seconds\n\nBooster engine cutoff (BECO)\nSecond stage engine cutoff (SECO)\nSpacecraft-launch vehicle separation\n\n-more-\n\n-5NOMINAL MISSION PLAN\nGemini-7\nGemini-7 is scheduled to be launched from Complex 19, Cape Kennedy\nat about 2:30pm EST, December U. It vill be launched into an elliptical\norbit with an apogee of 210 miles end a perigee of 100 miles.\n\nThe\n\norbit will be inclined 28.87 degrees to the equator.\nThe spacecraft is to separate from the booster 30 seconds ffter\nsustainer engine cutoff.\nImmediately following spacecraft separation, the spacecraft will\nturn around to blunt end forward, and begin station keeping on the\nbooster second stage, otation keeping will continue for about 25\nminutes ground elapsed time (GET) from liftoff.\n\nThis time extends\n\ninto about five minutes before the first darkness period.\nCelestial radicmetry experiments will be conducted during the\nremainder of the first darkness period.\nAt three hours, ;>0 minutes after lift-off as the spacecraft is\nat its third apogee, thrusters will be fired in a posigrade maneuver\nto raise the perigee to 12A miles.\n\nThis maneuver establishes e space-\n\ncraft orbital lifetime of 15 days.\nThe next several days of the flight will be devoted to conducting\nassigned experiments.\nAt about five days in flight the crew will circularize the spacecraft orbit to provide the proper target orbit for. Gemini 6.\n\nThe exact\n\nmaneuvers required will depend on the decay rate of the Gemini 7 orbit\nand the expected liftoff time of Gemini 6, now planned for eight days,\n19 hours and four juinutes following Gemini 7 liftoff.\n-more-\n\n-6Under present plans, circularizetion maneuvers will be performed\nhours after lift-off of the Gemini 7 spacecraft. The crew will give\nthe spacecraft a posigrede thrust at apogee. This will result in p\nchange of velocity of 100 feet per second end circulerizetion at 185\nuales.\nThe rendezvous portion of the Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 spacecraft is\ndescribed in the Gemini 6 Nominal l"iission\n\nHen.\n\nThe remaining Gemini 7 experiments will be conducted following\ncompletion of rendezvous activities.\n\nThe Gemini 7 crew will initiate\n\nretrof ire near the end of the 206 th revolution.\n\nLanding will be in\n\nthe West Atlantic recovery area at the beginning of the \' 2 7 h revolution.\n.0t\n\n-more\xe2\x80\x94\n\n-7-\n\n7a\nTwenty experiments ere scheduled for Gemini 7. Fourteen pre\ncontinuing experiments end neve been carried aboard previous Gemini\nflights. In repeating these over e nuniber of manned space flight\nmissions, experimeters hope to gain date covering a number of subjects\nunder varying flight conditions.\nrtesults of the experiments carried aborrd Gemini missions 3\nand 4 were presented at a symposium in Washington early this fell.\nSimilar sym po s ia will be held periodically during the manned spree\nflight program.\nExperiments Flown en Earlier Missions\n1. Cardiovascular Conditioning (?)*\nThis experiment will determine the effectiveness of cyclic inflations of pneumatic cuffs on the thighs as p preventive measure of\ncardiovascular deconditioning (heart end blood distribution system)\ninduced by prolonged weightlessness.\n\nThe cuffs are built into the\n\nspacesuit around the thighs and inflated periodically to 80nun of\nmercury pressure, increasing blood pressure below the cuffs. Tht\nautomatic pressurization cycle lasts two minutes cut of every six pnd\nuses oxygen from the environmental control system.\n2. In-Klight Exerciser (4 and 5)\nThe objective of this experiment is to assess the astronauts\'\ncapacity to perform physical work and their capability for sustpined\nperformance.\n\nThe rapidity with which the heart rate returns to normrl\n\n*ind.i cp-te.\', previous Gemini mission\n-more-\n\n-8-\n\nafter cessation of exercise is an indication of an individual\'s\nphysical fitness. A workload will be provided by specific periods\nof exercise at the rate of one pull per second for 30 seconds on an\nexercise device that requires a known amount of effort.\nThe exercise device consists of a pair of bungee cords attached\nto a nylon handle at one end and a nylon foot strap at the other end.\nThe in-flight data obtained will be compared with the control\ndata to determine the capacity for work in space.\n3. In-slight Phonocardiogram (A and 5)\nIn this experiment the fatigue state of en astronaut\'s heart\nmuscle will be determined by measuring the time interval between the\nactivation of a muscle and the onset of its contraction.\nA microphone will be applied to an astronnut\'s chest wall at the\ncardiac apex. Heart sounds detected during the flight will be recorded\non en onboard biomedical recorder. The sound trace will be compered\nto the waveform obtained from a simultaneous inflight electrocardiogram\nto detenr.ine the time interval between electrical activation of the\nheart muscle and the onset of ventricular systole.\nA.\n\nBone Demineralization (4 and 5)\nThe purpose of this experiment is to establish the occurence end\n\ndegree of bone demineralization influenced by the relative immobilization associated with the cockpit of the Gemini spacecraft and weightlessness.\nSpecial X-reys will be taken of en astronaut\'s heel bone and the\nterminal bone of the fifth digit of the right hend.\n-more-\n\nThree pre-flight\n\n-9and three post-flight exposures will be taken of these two bones pnd\ncompared to determine if any bone demineralization has occurred due to\nthe space flight.\nThe equipment to be used in this experiment will be closely\ncalibrated clinical X-ray machines, standard 11-inch by H-inch X-rey\nfilms and calibrated wedge densitometers.\n5. Human Otolith Function (5)\nA visual tester will be used to determine the estronauts orientation capability during flight.\n\nThe experiment will measure changes in\n\notolith (gravity gradient sensors in the inner ear) functions.\nThe tester is a pair of special light proof goggles, one eye\npiece of which contains a light source in the form of a movable white\nline. The astronaut positions the white line with a calibrated knurled\nscrew to what he judges to be the right pitch axis of the sppcecrnft.\nThe second astronaut then reads and records the numbers.\n6. hroton-Electron Spectrometer (4)\nIn order to determine the degree of hazard, if any, to which the\ncrew will be subjected on space flight, it is necessary to project\nwhat radiation environment any given mission will encounter.\n\nSpecif-\n\nically, this experiment will make measurements outside of the sppcecraft in a region where the inner Van Allen radiation belt dips close\nto the earth\'s surface due to the irregular strength of the earth\'s\nmagnetic field. This region is usually referred to as the South\nAtlantic Geomagnetic Anomaly.\n\n-more-\n\n-10-\n\nThis measurement will be /Accomplished by meetis of e scint.illntingcrystal, cherged-particle analyzer mounted on the edapter essembly cf\nthe spacecraft.\n\nData from this.experiment will be used to correlate\n\nradiation measurements mede inside the spacecraft end to predict rsdietion\nlevels on future space mission.\n7.\n\nTri-Axis Magnetometer (4.)\nThe purpose of this experiment is to monitor the direction snd\n\namplitude of the earth\'s magnetic field with respect to rn orbiting\nspacecraft.\n\nThe astronauts will operate an adapter-mounted tri-exis\n\nfluxgate magnetometer as they pass through the South Atlantic Geomagnetic Anomaly.\n\nThe magnitude of the three directions of the earth\'s\n\nmagnetic field will be measured with respect to the spacecraft. The\nmeasurement will be performed in conjunction with the Proton Electron\nSpectrometer experiment to determine the field, line direction and\npitch angle of the impacting psrticles.\n8.\n\nCelestial Hadiometry\nSpace l\xc2\xbbb.jectr ftadiometry (5)\nThe results of these experiments will provide information en\n\nradiation intensity of celestial bodies and various objects in spsce.\nInstrumentation includes a three-channel spectro-radiometer, P dunlchannel hichelson Interferometer-Spectrometer, and 8 cryogenicwlly\ncooled spectrofljeter.\n\nThe equipment can measure radiant intensity from\n\nthe ultra-violet through the infrared region.\n\nThe sensing units F.re\n\nhoused in the Gemini adapter section and ere directed toward the\nobjective by orienting the spacecraft.\n\n-more-\n\n-11The objectives for these experiments are to determine the onset\nof sensitivity values for earth objects end sky background radiation\nand radiation signatures of various objects in space and on the ground.\nObservations will include exhaust plumes of rocket vehicles\nlaunched frou. the Eastern or Western Test Ranges, rocket sled exheusts\nat Hclloman Air Force Base, volcanoes and forest fires PS well rs\ncontrasting background areas such as deserts and warm ocean currents.\n9.\n\npimple Navigation (4)\nThe capability of men to navigate in space end to provide P\n\nreliable navigation system independent of ground support will be\ntested in this experiment.\n\nTwo special instruments have been developed\n\nfor use on Gemini spacecraft to allow detailed menuel-visuel examination\nof the space phenomena thought to be best for space navigation purposes.\nThese ere a space stadimeter and a sextant.\n\nThis flight will only\n\ncarry the space sextant with which the astronaut will use to inp.ke\nstar-horizon angular measurements for orbital orientation deterndnptions.\nThe results will be compared with actual measurements to determine\nthe accuracy of the procecures.\n10.\n\nSynoptic Terrain i-hotography (A and 5)\nThe purpose is to obtain photos of selected parts of earth\'s\n\nsurface for use in research in geology, geophysics, geography, oceanography.\n\nThis experiment has been flown on every flight since MA-8.\n\nExperiment \xe2\x80\x94 70mm Kesselblad camera with 80mm Zeiss F2.8 lens;\ntwo packs of color film with 65 exposures each.\n\n-more-\n\nApproximately ninety\n\n-12-\n\npictures will be taken over areas of the world.\n\nPrimary erees ere\n\nthe shallow waters around the Bahamas, the Red See, and the west\ncentral portion of Mexico.\n11.\n\nSynoptic Weather Photography (3,4. and 5)\nThe Synoptic Weather Photography experiment is designed to ineke\n\nuse of lien\'s ability to photograph cloud systems selectively\xe2\x80\x94in\ncolor and in greater detail than can be obtained from the current\nI\'lriOS meteorological\n\nsatellite.\n\nA primary purpose of the experiment is to augment information\nfrom meteorological satellites which are contributing substantially to\nknowledge of the earth\'s weather systems.\n\nIn many areas they provide\n\ninformation where few or no other observations exist.\nExperiment \xe2\x80\x94 70mm Hasselblad camera with 80mm Zeiss F2.8 lens;\ntwo magazines of color film with 65 exposures each. Areas of Interest\nSquall line clouds, thunderstorm activity not associated with squall\nlines, frontal clouds and views of fronts, Jetstream cirrus clouds,\ntypical morning stratus of Gulf states, coastal cloudiness, tropic*!\nand extratropical cyclones, intertropicel convergence zone, cellular\npattern in subtropical phenomenon, wave clouds induced by islands and\nmountain ranges, broad banking of clouds in the trade winds or other\nregions.\n12.\n\nVisual Acuity\nAstronaut^Visibility (5)\nThe visual ability of the astronauts in the detection an\'d recog-\n\nnition of objects on the earth\'s surface will be tested in these expert\n\n-more-\n\n-13-\n\nmerits. The spacecraft will be equipped with P vision tester rnd *\nphotometer.\n\nThe astronauts will use the vision tester tt. evpluste\n\nvisual sightings from space relative to enrthbound baseline values.\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nL..\n..J\n\n\\\n\n\\\n-more-\n\n-IkIhe photometer will measure light attenuation of the spacecraft window\ndue to scattering. While the spececraft is oriented the astronputs\nwill view e pettern of penels laid out near Laredo, Texas pnd record\ntheir findings.\n\nViewings will be correlated with laboratory experiments\n\nend vision will be checked pre- end post-flight.\nDuring passage of the spacecraft over the sites, the commend\nastronaut shall be responsible for maintaining the proper spacecraft\nattitude while the second astronaut observes the target pree and makes\nverbal comments to the principal investigator at the site.\nFor five minutes in each 24. hour period, each astronaut will use\nthe on-bcard vision tester to test his own visual acuity on an opportunity basis.\n\n-more-\n\n-15EXFERIMEHTS TO BE FLOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\n1. Bioassays Body Fluids\nIn this experiment the astronauts reaction to stress during space\nflight will be studied "by means of analysing body fluids.\nand post-flight blood samples will be taken.\n\nPre-flight\n\nIn-flight urine will be\n\nmeasured at each voiding and a portion of this stored in special bags.\nFrom analysis of these fluids experimenters hope to measure body\nhormones, electrolytes, proteins, amino acids and enzymes which may be\nproduced as a result of stress.\n2. Calcium Balance Study\nThe rate and amount of calcium change to the body during the conditions of orbital flight will be evaluated in this experiment by means\nof controlled calcium intake and output measurements.\n\nIn addition to\n\ncalcium, other electrolytes of interest such as nitrogen phosphorous,\nsodium chloride and magnesium will be monitored.\nThe two astronauts will be maintained on a prescribed calcium diet\nfor two weeks prior to flight, during and after flight.\n\nCareful record-\n\ning of input-output will be accomplished and total fecal and urine\nspecimens will be preserved for analysis.\n\nSweat will also be measured\n\nby careful cleansing of the crew in distilled water following recovery.\nUndergarments will be similarly cleaned and the water analysed.\n3. In-Flight Sleep Analysis\nThe objectives of this experiment are to assess the astronauts\'\nstate of alertness, levels of consciousness, and depth of sleep during\n-more-\n\n-16flight. An electroencephalograph (EBG) on the astronauts vill be taken\nduring weightless flight to establish the possible use of the EEG as a\nmonitoring tool to help determine the state of alertness and depth of\nsleep. The electrical activity of the cerebral cortex will be monitored\nby two pairs of scalp electrodes and recorded on the biomedical recorder.\n4. Optical Communication (Laser)\nLaser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission\nof Radiation. Stimulated emission is produced by greatly exciting the\natom. When excited the atom will emit small quantities of light in\nphase or unison. Thus the light is "coherent," that is, it is directed\nin a constant steady beam in one precise direction.\nThis experiment is an attempt to demonstrate a new technique for\ncommunication between an orbiting spacecraft and a ground station. In\ndoing this, a demonstration of optical frequencies for communications\nwill be achieved and certain atmospheric data will be recorded and the\nvalue of an astronaut as a "pointing control" will be established.\nThe primary atmospheric data to be obtained are background radiance\nand attenuation.\n\nThis data and the experience obtained from this experi-\n\nment will be useful in designing future systems.\nThe experiment equipment consists of a flight transmitter and a groundbased receiver transmitter system.\nThe flight transmitter resembles and is about the same size as a home\nmovie camera. It weighs about six pounds and is completely self-contained.\nIt is made up of four injection lasers, a 10-volt power supply (eight\nrechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries), a d.c. (direct current) to d.c.\nconverter, a telescopic sight and a microphone.\n-more-\n\n-17Four gallium arsenide injection lasers are the heart of the\ntransmitter.\n\nThey deliver a total of 16 watts of light power at a\n\nwavelength of 9>000 angstroms.\n\nThe beams produced by the lasers form\n\nfour lines of light arranged one above the other making a square\npattern at distances of several feet to infinity.\nInjection lasers were chosen for their compactness, light weight\nand efficiency in converting electric energy into light energy.\nThe ground-based receiver resembles a short, blunt telescope. It\nis 30 inches in diameter and consists of a collector and focusing unit\nwith a photoraultiplier (optical detector) located at the focal plane.\nAn argon gas laser beacon is mounted atop the receiver barrel.\nThe argon gas laser has an output of three watts into a three milliradian beam spread or about 0.17 degree. At 300 miles the beam will be\napproximately 0.9 mile in diameter.\nReceiver systems have been installed at White Sands Missile Range,\nAscension Island and Kauai, Hawaii. The receivers are slaved to PPS\nradars and always point toward the spacecraft when it is within range\nof the radar.\nIn operation the command pilot will maintain proper spacecraft\norientation while the co-pilot aims the laser transmitter by sighting\nthrough the telescope at the ground-based argon laser. The argon laser\nbeam will be visible to the naked eye.\nWhen the spacecraft laser beacon is acquired by the ground receiver\nthe ground-based argon laser will be flashed to indicate that contact\nhas been established.\n\nBoth beacons will then be aligned and voice\n-more-\n\n-18communications can "begin. The co-pilot will switch to the voice channel\nand say, "1, 2, 3, ^, 5, testing 5, ^, 3, 2, 1."\nVoice communications will be one way only - from spacecraft to ground.\nDuring the experiment the astronauts will wear safety goggles for\nprotection against eye damage which might be caused by stray or reflected light from the onboard laser.\n\nThe glasses have shields for stopping\n\nradiation which enter the eye from the side and lenses that filter out\nthe infrared energy emitted by the laser.\n5. Landmark Contrast Measurements\nThe purpose of this experiment is to measure the visual contrast of\nland-sea boundaries and other types of terrain to be used as a service\nof navigation data for the onboard Apollo Guidance and Navigation system.\nLandmark contrast measurements made from outside the atmosphere will\nprovide data of a high confidence level to effectively duplicate navigation sightings for Apollo.\nLandmark measurements will be made of such areas as the Florida Coast,\nSouth American Chilean Coast, African-Atlantic Coast and Australian Coast.\nA photometric telescope sensor and equipment used for the Star Occultation Navigation experiment will be used.\n6. Star Occultation Navigation\nThe feasibility and operational value of star occulting measurements\nin the development of a simple, accurate and self-contained orbital\nnavigational capability will be investigated in this experiment.\nThe astronauts will determine the orbit of the Gemini spacecraft by\nmeasuring the time stars dip behind an established horizon.\n-more-\n\n-19As much of the existing Gemini onboard equipment as is possible will\nbe used for the recording of photometric sensor output signal intensity\nand time. Nevertheless, certain special equipment will be necessary for\nthe performance of the navigational studies. Included in the equipment\nis a photoelectric sensor.\nThe photoelectric sensor consists of a telescope, eyepiece, reticle,\npartially silvered mirror, iris, chopper, optical filters, photomultiplier, pre-amplifier and associated electronics.\n\nThe instrument is\n\nhand-held to the astronaut\'s eye for viewing out the spacecraft\'s\nwindow.\nAs .the astronaut views the horizon, he looks for bright stars about\nto be occulted. He then points the telescope at one and centers the\nstar within a reticle circle. A portion of the radiation is then\ndiverted to a photomultiplier\xe2\x80\x9e\n\nWith a hand-held switch, the astronaut\n\ninitiates a calibration mode in which the intensity of the star is\nmeasured automatically. He then tracks the star within the reticle as\nthe star passes into the atmosphere and behind the edge of the earth.\nThe tracking period for each star is approximately 100 seconds. During\nthis tracking period the astronaut will manually indicate the passage\nof the star through the air glow, the 50% intensity level and complete\noccultation simply by momentarily depressing the calibration switch.\nThe astronaut plays an essential role in the procedure, First, he\nsolves the star acquisition problem by locating the next star to be\ntransited. Second, he uses his head to point the telescope thus eliminating a two-gimbal automatic tracking system which would of necessity\nbe used if he were not onboard. Third, he records star occultation times\n-more-\n\n-20manually for comparison vith the automatic calibration mode. Finally,\nhe notes peculiarities in the data as it is collected. In performing\nthis latter function, the man is used to greatest advantage to advance\nthe state of the navigational art as rapidly as possible.\n\n-21GAMERA EQUIPMENT FOR GEMINI 1 AND 6 MISSIONS\n16MM MAURER MOVIE CAMERA\n\nI.

Since that time both the spacecraft and launch vehicle\nwere placed in "bonded" storage under guard to insure that their\nmechanical and electrical integrity remains intact.\nThe Gemini 6 checkout will be the same as if a problem had\noccurred several days before the originally planned Gemini 6 flight\nand the spacecraft had to be de-mated from the launch vehicle. With\nthe problem solved, the spacecraft would again be mated end a "compressed"\ncheckout would take place in the days leading up to a launch, as most\nof the previous testing was still valid.\nOnce Gemini 7 has been launched, crews will be ready to erect\nthe 6 launch vehicle end mate the spacecraft as soon as possible.\n\nThe\n\nschedule calls for this to be completed some 2L, hours after Gemini 7\nliftoff.\nCertain tests conducted during a normal mission will not have\nto be repeated for Gemini 6 because they will still remain valid\n(their validity will be checked, however).\n\nThese include various\n\ncalibrations of launch vehicle, spacecraft and blockhouse automatic\n\n-more-\n\n-26-\n\nground support equipment; weight and balancing of the erector,\ncertain spacecraft pro-mate and extensive spacecraft launch vehicle\ncombined systems tests.\n\nAnother departure from regular checkout\n\nprocedure is that the Gemini 6 spacecraft will be fueled end the\nwater supply and batteries will be installed before it gets to the\nlaunch pad.\nThe spacecraft and launch vehicle crews (McDonnell Aircraft is\nprime contractor for the spacecraft and Martin Company for the\nlaunch vehicle) will work on a three-shift, 2^=-hour schedule .during\nthe period between the launches.\nThe following is a general outline of the comprehensive work\nschedulei\nThe Gemini 7 is scheduled for launch at 2:30 p.m. EST.\nAs soon as possible an assessment of pad damage will be mede.\nThe blast damage has been very minimal in the past, requiring replacement primarily of some expendable wiring et the base of the pad.\nVarious umbilical cables etc. will be checked to insure that they\nare operating.\n\nThis work can be accomplished at the same time as\n\nthe two launch vehicle stages are being erected and as the spacecraft\nis mated.\nDuring launch days plus one and two, preparations will be made\nfor final spacecraft systems tests.\n\nThe validity of the electrical\n\ninterface between the spacecraft end launch vehicle will be verified\non the third day as individual tests of the two continue.\n\n-more-\n\n-27The final spacecraft systems tests are to be conducted on days\nthree and four. During this time the previous verification of\nguidance between the spacecraft and launch vehicle is checked.\nLiquid oxygen for the spacecraft environmental control system\nwill be loaded aboard during this time as preparations are made for\nthe simulated flight, scheduled for launch day plus five. From this\npoint, to Gemini 6 liftoff, the checkout will be generally the same\nas of any other Gemini flight.\nThe simulated flight, which lasts some 10 to 12 hours, consists\nof three simulated launches \xe2\x80\x94 A mode II abort run (an abort occurs\nsome 1:38 after liftoff), a switchover to secondary guidance during\npowered flight, and finally, a normal flight and insertion into\norbit, during which various orbital exercises, reentry and recovery\ntests are run. The prime pilots and their backups participate in\nthese tests aboard the spacecraft at Launch Complex 19*\nAnother "time saver" comes after the simulated flight when the\nvarious pyrotechnics aboard the spacecraft are thoroughly checked\nand connected. Since the pyrotechnics system was varified previously\nand left in a flight mode configuration, only a short test for verification will be required.\nThe Gemini 6 pre-count (lasting some four hours on the third day before\nlaunch) and the mid-count (lasting some four hours on the second day before\nlaunch) will be very similar to regular Gemini procedures. During the precount significant portions of each spacecraft system are again checked.\n\n-more-\n\n-28Final interface tests between the spacecraft and launch vehicle\n(guidance, abort procedures etc.) are conducted during the mid-count.\nThe Gemini 7 and 6 final countdowns will be about the same\xe2\x80\x94\nthe spacecraft starting at about T-6 hours end the launch vehicle\nat T-4. hours. However, on Gemini 6, a hold will be declared at T-3\nminute mark in the count to adjust the launch time to the planned\nrendezvous with Gemini 7. This hold will last 25 minutes. The\nGemini 6 launch time is scheduled for 9:35 e.m.

Second\nstage booster yaw steering will be used to place the spacecraft into the\nsame orbital plane as Gemini 7. Yaw steering provides up to 0055 degree\ninclination increment change if needed. The spacecraft will trail Gemini 7\nby 1208 miles at insertion.\nLaunch Windows (EST).\nNominal Bay\n\n9:3tam to 10:21am\n\nN\n\n+ 1\n\n9:38am to 10:25am\n\nN\n\n+ 2\n\n8:07am to 8:5Uam\n\nN\n\n+ 3\n\n8:Ham to 8:58am\n\nN\n\n+ 4\n\n6:59am to 7:25am\n\n11:09am to\' ll:\n\n9:42am to 10:\n\n8:l\'mm to 9:01am\n\nRendezvous is planned for the fourth orbit of Gemini 6, if liftoff\nis on time. During the first 35 minutes of each launch opportunity each\n100 seconds delay in liftoff delays rendezvous by one spacecraft orbit.\nIf liftoff time occurs beyond 300 seconds, rendezvous will not be\nattempted until the beginning of the second day when better tracking\ncoverage is available.\nShould .Liftoff occur durin/;, th<j lust 1?J minuter; o.l\' the maximum\nhj minute- window, a different intermediate sequence of maneuvers will\nbe initiated to narrow the catch-up distance between the spacecraft.\n-more-\n\n-31-\n\nln this case, engine cutoff occurs earlier to reduce velocity by\n50 feet per second. This causes the spacecraft to be inserted into\na lower orbit than planned, with a perigee of about 100 miles and\napogee of 138 miles. In this orbit the Gemini 6 catchup rate will\nbe increased due to the greater difference in altitude between the\ntwo spacecraft.\nVarying insertion velocity as described above has the effect\nof widening the launch window.\nFollowing a successful, on-time liftoff and insertion the\nuncertainties of the effect of drag on the spacecraft during its\ninitial orbit may require a one foot per second posigrade burn at\nfirst perigee to raise apogee. In the event of small insertion\ndispersions, the magnitude of this maneuver may vary but the resulting apogee will be 168 miles.\nNear the second apogee a posigrade burn will add 53 feet per\nsecond to raise perigee to about 134 miles. This reduces the catchup\nrate from 6.7 degrees to 4.5 degrees per orbit and will provide the\nproper phase relationship between the two spacecraft for circular!zation at third apogee.\nShould the two spacecraft be in different planes, e plane adjustment will be made by Gemini 6 at the common node (where the two spacecraft orbits intersect) following the second apogee posigrade burn.\nAt the third Gemini 6 spacecraft apogee, e posigrade burn of 53\nfeet per second will be made to circularize the orbit et 1^6 miles.\n-more-\n\n-32-\n\no\nN\nLU\n\nLU\nfV\xc2\xbb\n\n^O\n\nI-S LU\n\nO\n< OQ\n\no\n\n-33-\n\nGemini 6 will then be trailing Gemini 7 by about 184 miles.\nThis is within range of the onboard radar and lock-on should have\noccurred.\nA 32 feet per second posigrade burn will be made at terminal\nphase initiation along the line of sight to Gemini 7. This will be\nat a ground elapsed time of about 5 hours, 15 minutes - about one\nminute after entering darkness.\n\nThe range between the spacecraft\n\nat this time is expected to be about 39 miles.\nApproximately 33 minutes following terajnal phase initiation\na posigrade velocity of 43 feet per second will be applied to\nGemini 6. This places the two spacecraft into the same orbit and\nrendezvous will have been accomplished.\nShould there be computer, platform or radar failure, the mission\ncan still proceed using ground data and radar-optical or optical\nrendezvous modes.\nRetrofire will occur at a ground elapsed time of W> hours end\n10 minutes, during the 29th revolution.\nWest Atlantic recovery area.\n\n-more-\n\nLanding will be in the\n\n-356a\nThree experiments will be performed during the Gemini 6 mission:\n1.

As on Gemini missions \'i and. 5, Houston\'s\nReal-Time Computer Complex (RTCC) (a key element of the MCC-H) will serve\nas the mission computing center.\nFor Gemini 7-6 the network will provide:\n(1) Tracking and telemetry data during launch and orbital phases\nfrom both the Gemini 7 and the Gemini 6 spacecraft for position determination\nand systems operation.\n(2) Capability for transmission and verification of ground commands\nto either or both spacecraft.\n\nThese commands, generated at the mission\n\ncontrol center, update the spacecraft computer to provide current information for time-of-retrofire determination and reentry calculations and\ndisplays.\nPrime Computing Support\nImmediate computing support will be provided from launch through\nimpact by the RTCC at the Manned Spacecraft Center. During the launch\nand insertion phase, the RTCC will receive high-speed radar data from\nBermuda and radar and MISTRAM (Missile Tracking and Measurement System)\ndata from the Air Force Eastern Test Range (AFETR). radars via the Cape\nKennedy-Houston GLDS (Gemini Launch Data System).\nOther Computer Support\nNASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) real-time computing support\nfor Gemini 7-6 includes the processing of skin tracking information\n-more-\n\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2 .\n\n-39obtained from the second stages of both launch vehicles and the\ncomputation of their predicted impact points. Additionally, the\nGSFC RTCC will generate skin track (radar echo bounce) space\nposition predictions for the Manned Space Flight Network and the\nDepartment of Defense for their use in the event of spacecraft\nbeacon loss or powered-down flight.\nNetwork Readiness\nComputers at the GSFC will certify the worldwide network\'s\nreadiness to support Gemini 1-6 through a system-by-system TIM,\nCMD, RDR, station-by-station, computer-programmed checkout method\ncalled CADFISS (Computation and Data Flow Integrated Subsystem Tests).\nCheckout of network facilities also will be performed by the GSFC\nduring post-launch periods when the spacecraft are not electronically\n"visible" by some stations and continue until the vehicles are again\nwithin acquisition range.\nData Flow Tests (DFT\'s) from the worldwide network to the Manned\nSpacecraft Center\'s Real-Time Computing Complex will be conducted from\nthe Manned Spacecraft Center under the direction of the CADFISS Test\nDirector.\n.TRACKING TWO MANNED SPACECRAFT\nFor Gemini 7-6, various combinations of spacecraft tracking and\ndata acquisition assignments will be accomplished according to individual\nstation capability.\n-more-\n\n-40Both Gemini spacecraft are equipped with. C-Band beacon systems\nthat aid station radars of the Manned Space Flight Network in pinpointing precise space position of each vehicle. In order that these\nradiated signals "be readily distinguishable by the ground systems,\ntheir identifying codes have been altered slightly for precise\nrecognition.\nThrough the detection of the spacecraft beacon, ground trackers\npinpoint each spacecraft with an accuracy equivalent to a 22 bullet\nhitting a twenty-five cent piece at a distance of one mile. Electronically coordinated (slaved) telemetry receiving and radio command\nantenna systems acquire data from and send instructions to each\nspacecraft based in part on the space position information provided\nby the beacon tracking radars.\nAfter Gemini 6 spacecraft insertion into orbit, stations in the\nManned Space Flight Network will, for the first time, simultaneously\ntrack and acquire information from two orbiting manned spacecraft.\nWhile both spacecraft are in orbital flight the on-site flight\ndata summary computer.(UNIVAC 1218) called TOMCAT (Telemetry On-Line\nMonitoring, Compression and Transmission) processes Gemini 6 or 7\n(whichever spacecraft has been designated "prime") spacecraft data.\nUpon termination of the Gemini 6 mission, all network station\nsystems will revert to previous Gemini 7 operating modes for the\nremainder of the mission.\n\n-more-\n\n-41ORB1TS - REVOLUTIONS\nThe spacecraft\'s course is measured in revolutions around the\nearth.\n\nA revolution is completed each time the spacecraft passes\n\nover 80 degrees west longitude, or at Gemini altitudes about once\nevery 96 minutes.\nOrbits are space referenced and in Gemini take pbcut 90 minutes.\n\n-more-\n\n-42CREW TRAINING BACKGROUND\n\nIn addition to the extensive general training received prior to\nflight assignment the following preparations have or will be accomplished prior to launch:\n1.
