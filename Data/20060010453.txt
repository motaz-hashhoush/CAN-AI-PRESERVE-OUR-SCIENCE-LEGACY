The\ndata was acquired to develop and validate analytical methods used to predict rollout Orbiter fatigue load spectra.\nEarlier predictions computed by a base drive approach with only 5 input drive degrees-of-freedom raised\nquestions that commissioned the partial stack test. Not only was there a concern because of the input degree-offreedom omission due to measurement limitations, but there was also a concern with the implementation of the\n"large mass" itself. Three methods were evaluated with the partial stack test data. The analytical correlations to\nmeasured strain derived SRB base loads and acceleration5 showed the earlier 5 degree-of-freedom base drive\napproach to yield the most conservative results for all quantities monitored except the SRB base moment about\nthe axis in which the input drive was missing. This non-conservative shortcoming led to a recommendation to use\neither the 6 degree-of-freedom base drive or the 12 degree-of-freedom Craig-Bampton boundary drive methods\nwhose results did not substantially differ.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe rollout of the Space Shuttle Vehicle (SSV) from the Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) to the launch pad is a\nslow, exacting process that reaches maximum speeds of only 0.9 miles per hour and takes approximately 6 hours\nto cover the 3 to 4 mile distance. While not often thought of as a "dynamic" engineering venue, the ride to the pad\nis anything but discounted. The "crawler-way\'\' itself is a unique river rock surfaced road bed that is prepared for\nevery SSV pass. The 3 million pound SSV is cantilevered from the base of its left and right Solid Rocket Boosters\n(SRBs) to the 9 million pound Mobile Launch Platform (MLP). The SSV consists of three Elements: the SRBs, the\nExternal Tank (ET), and the Orbiter. Both the 150 foot tall SRBs and the Orbiter attach to the ET which rises an\nadditional 35 feet above the SRBs. The MLP is attached at four locations to the 6 million pound Crawler\nTransporter (CT) that drives the assembly to the pad. The CT to MLP interface is approximately 20 feet above\nthe road bed, and the MLP to SRB interface is at 45 feet. The CT to MLP attachment locations are arranged in a\n90 foot square, centered above the CT "propulsion trucks" at each of the CTs four corners. The interface schema\nis fairly complex with each corner attachment possessing a unique load carrying capability such that there is\nvertical continuity at each with only four additional lateral translational components distributed among them. Each\ncorner attachment also includes four pressurized "JEL" cylinders for jacking, equalizing, and leveling. The\npropulsion trucks contain a five gear and pinion system that transfer the power to the tread belt sprockets that\ndrive dual belts, each fitted with fifty-seven, 2,200 pound, steel shoe treads. This assortment of gear meshing,\nshaft rotation, and shoe impact effects supply an environment rich in narrowband, harmonic content to the MLP\nthat in turn transfers it to the base of the receptive SSV with overlapping modal frequencies.\nConcern with the potential ofthis structural dynamic confluence occurred early in the SSV program. A rollout\nenvironment characterization was conducted in 1979 prior to the STS-1 mission with 19 dynamic acceleration\nmeasurements recorded on the Space Shuttle Facilities Verification Vehicle (FW), also known as the Pathfinder\nVehicle, for CT speeds from 0.10 through 1.0 miles per hour (MPH) [I]. the nominal rollout speed of 0.90\nFor\nMPH, peak accelerations on the order o 0.10 \'\'g" were observed on the Orbiter tail and wing, with half these\nf\n\n~-\n\n-\n\nlevels at the SRB tip. A 2.9 Hz dominant frequency was noted. In general response increased with speed. It was\nconcluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthere do not appear to be any adverse dynamic response concerns from the Crawler Transporter\nforcing functions\xe2\x80\x9d. Apparently due to this relatively benign characterization, no rollout loads spectra were\ndeveloped to address structural life at that time, however load cases were generated to support the completeness\nof structural design from a strength perspective.\nTwo decades later as part of the Hurricane Preparedness Program, SRB hold down post (HDP) strains were\nrecorded during rollout on STS-103 and STS-99 in 1999. The HDPs are the SRB\xe2\x80\x99s interface to the MLP with four\nHDPs per SRB bolted to the MLP. Although the measured load magnitudes were in fact benign compared to\ndesign limits, the levels combined with the number cycles suggested that further structural life assessments be\nconducted [2]. Measurements continued for I 1 additional missions through STS-I09 in early 2002 that included 6\nchannels of MLP accelerations in addition to the SRB HDP strains. The accelerations were limited to two center\nline MLP locations at the front and aft ends of the lower deck. This data was used to excite a structural finite\nelement model of the MLP/SSV assembly to compute SRB, ET, and Orbiter structural response loads from which\nrollout spectra were then generated to assess the SSVs structural life. Reference 2 documents this process and\nthe release of rollout spectra for the Orbiter and SRB Elements in January 2003.\nWhat was anticipated to be simply an exercise for completeness, became a program level concern as the Orbiter\nElement reported a significant decrease in life due to the January 2003 spectra. With the spectra report itself\ncasting concerns with the approach, stating that \xe2\x80\x9csome loads conditions proved to be unstable as the base-drive\nmethodology caused overly-excited responses\xe2\x80\x9d when compared to the SRB base loads derived from the HDP\nmeasured strains, an overall program level review ensued. The review ultimately recommended that testing be\nconducted to evaluate the analytical methodologies, and the effects of the 5 degree-of-freedom (DOF) base drive\ninput restriction that omitted the \xe2\x80\x9croll\xe2\x80\x9d moment about the CT/MLP because of the co-linear located measurements.\nIn September of 2003, the program authorized near term tests without the ET and Orbiter, a.k.a. Partial Stack\nTests, and subsequent Full Stack Tests upon return to flight. The Partial Stack Tests were to include two\nconfigurations; one with the SRBs on the CTlMLP, and one with the CTlMLP alone [3]. In November 2003 the\nPartial Stack Test was conducted with the CT/MLP/SRB configuration shown in Figure 1. 111 channels of\nacceleration data were recorded along with 80 channels o SRB HDP strains, 8 channels of JEL cylinder\nf\npressures, and a channel for CT speed and one for ambient wind. Data was collected for over ten hours over two\ndays in ten minute or greater segments. The segments captured transient and steady state operations over\nvarious road bed conditions. Transient segments included acceleration and deceleration from and to \xe2\x80\x9crest\xe2\x80\x9c.\nSteady state segments included variation in CT speeds from 0.5 to 0.9 miles per hour in 0.1 mile per hour\nincrements on straight and turning crawler way sections. Steady state data was also taken at rest for wind only\nassessments.\n\nition\n\n'
