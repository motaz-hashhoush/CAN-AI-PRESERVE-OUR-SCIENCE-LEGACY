Abstracts The effect of laser generated stress waves on the microstructures, hardness,\nstrength and stress corrosion resistance -of 2024 and 7075 aluminum alloys was investigated. Pulsed C02 and neodymium-glass lasers were used in this study to determine the\neffect of wavelength and pulse duration on pressure generation and material property\nchanges. No changes in material properties were observed with the C02 laser. The\nstrength and hardness of 2024-T351 and the strength of 7075-T73 aluminum alloys were\nsubstantially improved by the stress wave environments generated with the neodymium-glas\nlaser. The mechanical properties of 2024-T851 and 7075-T651 were unchanged by the laser\ntreatment. The correlation of the laser shock data with published results of flyer plat\nexperiments demonstrated that a threshold pressure needed to be exceeded before strength\nening and hardening could occur. Peak pressures generated by the pulsed laser source\nwere less than 7.0 GPa which was below the threshold pressure required to change the\nmechanical properties of 2024-T851 and 7075-T651. Corrosion studies indicated that lase\nshocking increased the resistance to local attack in 2024-T351 and 7075-T651.\n17. Key Words and Document Analysis.\n\n17a. Descriptors\n\n17b.

Slater\nBattelle Columbus Laboratories\n\nSUMMARY\n\nLaser shock hardening of aluminum alloys was investigated using\nthree lasers, a TEA-CO_ laser and low and high energy neodymium-glass\npulsed lasers.\n\nThe effect of laser and material parameters on the peak\n\nshock pressures generated, surface hardness, tensile strength, dislocation\nsubstructure, and stress corrosion cracking initiation and propagation were\nall investigated.\n7075-T73.\n\nThe materials were 2024-T351, 2024-T851, 7075-T651 and\n\nMost of the studies on hardening were performed on 2024-T351.\n\nThe stress corrosion cracking studies were performed on 2024-T351 and\n7075-T651.\n\nThe TEA-C09 laser and the low energy neodymium-glass laser did\n\nnot produce noticeable increases in surface hardness or tensile strength of\nthese alloys.\n\nThe high energy pulsed neodymium-glass laser generated peak\n\nshock pressures of up to 6.7 GPa.\n\nLaser shocking increased the surface\n\nhardness and tensile strength in 2024-T351 and 7075-T73, but not in 2024T851 or 7075-T651.\n\nThis was attributed to a lower strain hardening rate\n\nand higher yield strengths in the last two materials.\n\nLaser shocking\n\nincreased the resistance to localized surface attack in both 2024-T351\nand 7075-T651.\n\nIt also appeared to improve the corrosion crack initiation\n\nresistance in 7075-T651, but there was no discernible improvement in\n2024-T351.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nShock hardening of metals has certain advantages over more\nconventional methods of strain hardening, such as cold rolling. One of the\n\nbiggest advantages is that a substantial amount of strain hardening can be\nintroduced into the workpiece with only a nominal change in dimensions.\nAnother is that the dislocation substructure is often in a somewhat different\narrangement from that obtained by conventional working.\n\nThese characteristics\n\nmake shock hardening attractive for applications such as thermo-mechanical\ntreatment or processing,\n\nmodification of properties such as to increase\n\xe2\x80\xa2eas<\nhardness, resistance to wear and erosion, stress corrosion resistance, (2)\n3\nand fracture toughness ( ) or to use the strain hardening directly to increase\n(4 5)\nstrength such as for shock hardening weld zones. \'\nAlong with these\nadvantages, there are offsetting disadvantages, the biggest of which is that\nthe requirement of explosives or high velocity driver plates or projectiles\nmakes the practical use of shock hardening difficult.\n\nHowever, the high\n\nenergy pulsed laser provides an opportunity to shock harden materials without\nthis disadvantage.\n\nIts beam produces the shock wave at the surface of the\n\ntarget material itself.\nLaser-induced shock hardening has the advantages of\nbeing able to harden surfaces or thin sections locally where extra strength\nor hardness are needed, it is adaptable to automated practice, and can be\nset up in a shop area with only modest precautions.\n\nThere are upper limits\n\nto the peak pressure and the pressure pulse durations, but the limits of\nthe peak shock pressures have not yet been reached, and there is much to be\nlearned about the interaction between the thermal and mechanical effects\nwhich determine the influence of the pulse length.\n\nThe production and control of laser-induced Shockwaves and their\nuse in materials processing is still in its early stages of development.\n\nIt\n\nhas been determined that the highest peak pressures are reached when a\nmaterial transparent to the laser beam is laid over the target material\'s\nsurface.\n\nAlso, different types of overlays, solid or liquid, transparent\n\nor opaque, produce stress waves of different intensity and place different\nupper limits on the maximum laser beam intensities possible before the laser\nenergy is no longer effectively coupled into the material being pro(7 8^\ncessed. \'\nThe dependence of peak shock wave pressure on various combinations of these overlay materials and laser peak power density, energy\ndensity, spot size, wavelength and pulse length requires more investigation\nand comparison to theory to clarify these effects.\n\nThis program investigated\n\ncombinations of fused quartz or water with black paint overlays and how peak\npressures depend on the laser beam parameters.\n\nTwo wavelengths of laser\n\nlight were investigated, 10.6 ym with the TEA-CO\nneodymium-glass laser.\n\nand 1.06 ym with the\n\nIn addition, a range of laser power and energy\n\ndensities were explored with the neodymium-glass lasers.\nA material\'s response to laser-induced shock waves will be similar\nto its response to explosive shocking or flyer plate impacts.\n\nHowever, the\n\nduration of the laser-induced shock waves are usually much shorter than\nthose produced by the latter methods, being less than several hundred nanoseconds in length.\n\nFor this reason, the shock hardening effects are con-\n\nfined to sections a few millimeters thick for through-section hardening, or\nto surface hardening extending a similar depth into the material.\nThere has been little research into shock hardening of aluminum\nalloys, because the shock hardening is not as dramatic as it is in some iron\n()\n9\nalloys.\nConventional shock hardening has shown evidence of improving\nstress corrosion resistance\n\nand fracture toughness\n\nin 7075 aluminum,\n\nand laser-induced shocks have strengthened weld zones and hardened surfaces\n()\n4\nof 6061 and 5083 aluminum alloys.\nThe study of the microstructural and\nmechanical property response of aluminum alloys to shock waves has been\nthe objective of only a few studies.\n\n\'\n\nHence, the response of\n\naluminum alloys to laser-induced shock waves accomplishes two purposes:\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n(Continued).^\n\nFigure 7.\n\nPressure Gauge and Specimen Assembly Used in\nTEA-CCL Laser Experiments\n\n20\n\nFigure 8.\n\nExperimental Arrangement of TEA-CO^ Experiments\n\n21\n\nFigure 9.\n\nHolder for Tensile Specimens Laser Shocked with\nthe 5J Neodymium-Glass Laser\n\n23\n\nExperimental Arrangement of 5J Neodymium-Glass\nLaser Experiments\n\n25\n\nExperimental Arrangement of Split Beam\nIrradiations\n\n26\n\nFigure 10.\n\nFigure 11.\n\nFigure 12.

for 7075, the overaged temper T7351 decreases\nstrength, increases toughness and decreases SCC susceptibility.\nThe stress corrosion data given above is the "worst-case" condition; that is, the specimens are tested with the end-grain exposed to\nan environment and the alloy is stressed in the short transverse direction.\n\nIn some cases, such a condition can be avoided, and stress corrosion\n\nprevented.\n\nUnfortunately, only the simplest shapes can be produced with-\n\nout such end-grain exposure; this means that either a low-susceptibility\nalloy (and often this implies a lower-strength alloy), and/or a surface\ntreatment method must be used.\n\nTABLE I.\n\nAlloy\n\nUltimate\nStrength,\nMN/m\n\nMECHANICAL PROPERTIES AS A FUNCTION OF ALLOY AND HEAT TREATMENT\n\n0.2% Yield\nStrength,\nMN/mZ\n\nShort Transverse\nK\nIC-3/2>\nMNm\n\nShort Transverse\nSCC Threshold Stress,\nMN/m2\n\nShort transverse\nSCC Crack Velocity,\n(m/s)\n\n2024-T351\n\n435\n\n286\n\n22-29\n\n<55\n\n7 X 10"9\n\n2024-T851\n\n455\n\n400\n\n18-26\n\n276\n\n3 X 10~4\n\n7075-T651\n\n538\n\n469\n\n16-22\n\n<55\n\n1 X\n\n10\'8\n\n7075-T7351\n\n475\n\n393\n\n21-23\n\n>296\n\n7 X\n\n10"11\n\nFrom reference 16.\n\nSurface treatments for aluminum to preclude stress corrosion\ninclude methods whereby the metal is protected from the environment (painting, coating, use of inhibitors) or where the surface of the metal is treated\nto make it more resistant to the stress corrosion process.\n\nSince stress\n\ncorrosion depends on the presence of a tensile stress, the introduction of\na compressive surface stress of sufficient magnitude should prevent the\ninitiation of stress corrosion. To date, this process has been accomplished\n(18\xe2\x80\x9421^\nby shot-peening.\nThe mechanism of protection is a combination of\ninduced surface compressive stresses together with distortion of grain\nboundaries to hinder intergranular corrosion.\n\nA problem is that, if the\n\nthin (^ 0.25 mm) shot-peened layer is breached, either by a deep scratch\nor by environmental pitting, then all protection is lost.\n\nThe latter is\n\nparticularly true for Cu-containing alloys of the 2000 series which are\nextremely susceptible to pitting.\n\nThus, shock hardening, which can possibly\n\ndeepen the extent of the surface effect, would be valuable in inhibiting\nSCC attack.\nThe problem with explosive shocking is that it is usually applicable only to the pre-fabrication process, and is generally non-selective\nin the areas to be treated.\n\nThe advent of laser shocking has given the\n\nopportunity to give a deeper mechanical treatment than peening of fabricated components while being extremely selective in treatment area.\n\nThus,\n\nthe effect of such a treatment on surface hardness, strength and SCC\ninitiation needs to be studied.\n\nThis should include a study of the possi-\n\nble influence of laser shocking on the corrosion\n\nresistance\xe2\x80\x94particularly\n\npitting\xe2\x80\x94of the alloy, since the deformation of the grain boundary region\nby shocking is expected to influence this behavior.\nhas not been investigated.\n\nThis facet of shocking\n\nFurther, the deeper surface treatment available\n\nfrom laser shocking brings the possibility that both an initiation and a\npropagation step may be necessary if stress corrosion cracking does occur.\nThus, crack propagation studies should be undertaken also.\nThis program had as its objective to determine the extent and\nmechanisms by which laser-induced shocks interact with 2024 and 7075 aluminum to produce changes in tensile strength, hardness, microstructure and\nstress corrosion crack initiation and propagation resistance.\n\nIt was\n\nintended to determine the conditions for developing the highest strength\nand hardness levels in these alloys and examine their effects on the stress\ncorrosion resistance.\n\nAPPARATUS AND PROCEDURE\n\nLaser Systems\nThree different laser systems were used in this program.\nincluded:\n\nThey\n\n(1) a 75-J TEA-CO, laser, (2) a 5-J AO Model 30 Q-switched\n\nneodymium-glass laser, and (3) a CGE VD-640 very high power Q-switched\nneodymium-glass laser system which is capable of emitting up to 500 J of\nlaser energy in approximately 50 nanoseconds.\n\nThe TEA-CO_ laser and the 5 J\n\nneodymium-glass laser were used in the initial screening experiments to\ndetermine which laser environments offered the greatest potential for altering the properties of the aluminum alloys.\n\nThe 5 J laser also was used in\n\nlower-laser-energy density experiments, where the laser beam could be maintained at a reasonable spot size.\n\nThe bulk of the program experiments were\n\nconducted with the very high power neodymium-glass laser.\nThe custom-built TEA-CO\xe2\x80\x9e laser puts out a laser pulse at 10.6 vim\nwavelength characterized by an intense spike approximately 80 nanoseconds\no\n\nlong with a peak power of 1.6 x 10\n\nwatts followed by a nitrogen deexcita-\n\ntion tail lasting several microseconds.\n\nThe shape of the laser pulse was\n\nmeasured during the experiments with a photon drag detector, and the\nenergy delivered by the laser in a given pulse was monitored with a carbon\ncalorimeter.\nThe AO Model 30 neodymium-glass laser operates in a Q-switched\nmode with a laser pulse having a full width at one half maximum (FWHM) of\n40 nsec.\n\nThis system is capable of emitting approximately 5 joules of\nQ\n\n1.06 ym wavelength laser energy with a peak power of 2 x 10\n\nwatts.\n\nDuring\n\nthe experiments, the laser energy was monitored with a carbon calorimeter\nand the laser pulse shape was measured with a PIN photodiode.\nThe very high power CGE VD-640 neodymium-glass laser consists of\na Q-switched laser oscillator and electro-optical pulse shaper followed by\nsix amplifier stages.\n\nThe pulse shaper is able to provide continuously\n\nvariable laser pulses with a FWHM ranging from 1 nsec to the 20-40 nsec\nQ-switched output pulse of the oscillator.\n\nIn addition, it was possible\n\nto stretch the laser pulse out to a FWHM of approximately 100 nsec by\n\nplacing a glass plate in the oscillator cavity.\n\nThis long pulse mode of\n\noperation was used to increase the duration of the laser generated shocks\nin some of the specimens in order to investigate the effect of pulse length\non the change in material properties.\n\nIn practice only about one-half of\n\nthe 500 J energy of this laser can be delivered onto a target, primarily\nbecause of energy losses in a switching arrangement designed to suppress\namplified spontaneous laser emission that originates in the amplifier stages.\nIn the long pulse mode, about 200 J of laser energy can be routinely\ndelivered to a target.\n\nDuring the experiments the laser energy was moni-\n\ntored with a carbon calorimeter whose output was fed to an on-line data\nacquisition analysis computer system.\n\nThe laser pulse shape was measured\n\nwith a PIN photodiode whose output was displayed on a fast oscilloscope.\n\nMaterials\nMechanical property and microstructure studies.- The starting\n*\nmaterials were 6.4 mm-thick 2024-T351 and 7075-T651 aluminum plate.\nThe\n2024-T851 condition was obtained by aging the 2024-T351 plate 10 hr. at\n463\xc2\xb0K (190\xc2\xb0C), followed by air cooling.\naluminum are shown in figures 1 and 2.\n\nThe microstructures of the 2024\nThe T351 condition of the as-received:\n\nmaterial was reached by solution treating and cold stretching 1-1/2 to 3%.\n, The microstructure consisted of pancake-shaped grains (Figure la) containing a dislocation substructure and an intermediate precipitate probably\ncomposed of Mn-rich aluminum compounds (Figure 2a).\n\nThe aging treatment\n\nused to reach the T851 condition coarsens the grain size somewhat (Figure Ib)\nand produces a fine precipitate of lathe-shaped S phase (Figure 2b).\nThe 7075-T73 condition was obtained by solution treating the asreceived 7075-T651 plate for 1 hr. at 738\xc2\xb0K (465\xc2\xb0C) and cold water quenching,\nfollowed by a two step aging sequence consisting of 7 hr. at 383\xc2\xb0K (110\xc2\xb0C)\n\n*\nThe nominal compositions of the alloys in weight percent were as follows:\n2024: 4.4 Cu, 1.5 Mg, and 0.6 Mn\n7075: 5.6 Zn, 2.25 Mg, 1.6 Cu, and 0.3 Cr.\n\n*\xc2\xa3\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nV\n.-.\'.,.*\n\nRolling\nDirection\n\n(a)\n\n2024-T351\n\nFIGURE

mechanical property\nand structure studies could not be utilized for this part of the investigation.\n\nAccordingly, 76 mm-thick plate of 2024-T351 and 7075-T651 aluminum\n\nalloy was purchased.\n\nThe microstructures of the thicker plate were very\n\nsimilar to those for the thinner plate, consisting of pancake-shaped grains\nwith intermediate precipitates.\n\nSpecimen

either 1 or 3 mm thick.\n\n16\n\ndiscs had at least 300 urn removed from each surface by grinding with No. 600\npaper after machining.\nCorrosion studies.- Two "slices" were taken from the thick plate\nfor each alloy, perpendicular to and parallel to the rolling direction.\nThese slices were originally ^ 2 mm thick, and were then ground down to 1-mm\nthickness.\n\nFrom each of these slices, four standard tensile specimens of\n\nthe type shown in Figure 5 were taken, two for the shocked and two for the\nunshocked conditions, so that the tensile properties in the short transverse\ndirection on planes both perpendicular to and parallel to the rolling direction could be studied. The effect of shocking on corrosion resistance as\ndetermined by electrochemical behavior was investigated using the center\nportion of the shocked tensile specimens.\nCrack initiation specimens were taken from the slice perpendicular\nto the rolling direction.\n\nSix specimens, 76 mm long (thickness of plate),\n\n10 mm wide and 1 mm thick, were taken from each slice.\nThe crack propagation specimens were of the single-edge cracked\nplate type with the dimensions shown in Figure 6.\n\nThe use of this specimen\n\nfor stress corrosion crack propagation studies, and K calibrations, is\n(22)\ndiscussed by Smith and Piper.\nTo allow the crack to grow in the direction most susceptible to SCC, the specimens were cut from the slices taken\nparallel to the rolling direction.\n\nGenerally the thickness of specimens\n\nis taken so that plane strain conditions exist under loading.\n\nHowever, the\n\nthickness of the slices (determined by the penetration power of the laser)\nmeans that the condition in these specimens is one of plane stress.\n\nFour\n\ncrack propagation specimens were cut from each slice, two for laser shocking and two for loading in the unshocked condition.\n\nThe final sharp notch\n\nwas cut into the specimen by electrical discharge machining (EDM).\n\n17\n\n_L\n\n6.4mm\n\n6.4 mm\n\n76.2mm\n\nA = 2.5 mm deep\n0.15mm wide\nB = 3.8 mm deep\n0.50mm wide\n\nFIGURE 6.\n\nCRACK PROPAGATION SPECIMENS FOR STRESS CORROSION STUDY\n\n18\n\nExperimental Environments Selected\nfor Study\n\nSelection of the laser conditions for testing the 2024 and\n7075 aluminum alloys was based on an initial set of experiments with\nthe 2024-T851 alloy.\n\nThe TEA-CO\n\nand 5 J neodymium-glass lasers\n\nwere used in these experiments.\n\nThe principal laser parameters varied\n2\nin these tests were the laser power density in W/m and the number of\n\nlaser pulses used to shock a. given area of the alloy.\n\nThe results of\n\nthese studies helped in the selection of the laser parameters used in\nthe very high power neodymium-glass laser experiments.\nTEA-CO2 Laser Experiments.-Based on past work\n\n(23)\n\n, it was\n\nrecognized that efficient coupling of the 10.6 | , laser radiation into\njm\na metal target and the resultant generation of a high amplitude stress\nwave required running the experiments in a vacuum, plus the addition of\nan absorbing layer of material on the surface of the metal target specimen.\n\nThese conditions were required in order to suppress the initiation\n\nof laser supported absorption waves at higher laser power densities\nwhich limit the magnitude of the stress waves that can be generated in a\nmetal target.\n\nFor these experiments, water was selected as the absorbent\n\noverlay material to be placed over the metal surfaces.\n\nWater has an\n\nabsorption coefficient of 10 /m at 10.6 m wavelength\n\n, therefore the\n\nincident laser energy is absorbed near the surface of the water layer,\nthe stress is generated in this region and subsequently propagates\nthrough the rest of the water layer and into the metal specimen.\nA common liquid such as water has the advantage that it could be used in\na practical way to repeatedly shock the aluminum alloys.\n\n3\n2\nThe experiments were run in a vacuum of 6.67 x 10 N/m (50 torr)\n4\n2\nand 2.67 x 10 N/m (200 torr) in order to determine the effect of the\nambient pressure on the magnitude of the laser induced stress waves. Experi3\n2\nments at a vacuum less than 6.67 x 10 N/m were not practical because the\nrelatively high vapor pressure of water would cause the water layer to boil.\n\n19\n\nQuartz piezoelectric pressure tranducers were used to measure\nthe different pressure environments generated by the TEA-CO\npulse.\n\nlaser\n\nThese gauges, which are commercially available, were designed in\n\na guard-ring configuration to minimize the effect of fringe electric\nfields on the response of the gauges.\n\nIn order to ensure that uniaxial\n\nloading conditions were maintained in the gauges, the minimum laser spot\nsize used in the pressure measurements was at least 1.5 times the active\nelectrode diameter of the gauges.\n\nThe active element of these gauges\n\nwas X-cut crystalline quartz with a thickness of 1.28 mm and an inner\nelectrode diameter of 3.18 mm.\n\nA full scale cross sectional sketch of\n\nthe device used to hold the pressure transducers and aluminum specimens\nis shown in Figure 7.\n\nThe sketch is shown with a pressure transducer\n\ninserted through the central hole that is located in the brass disc.\nThe aluminum specimens,which were 1 mm-thick\n\ndiscs with a 15 mm diameter,\n\nwere laid directly on top of the brass disc and held in place by the upper\nlucite ring.\n\nThe experimental arrangement used to measure the laser\n\ninduced shock pressures and irradiate the aluminum alloys is shown in\nFigure 8.\nThe laser beam was deflected downward by an aluminum coated\nmirror to a concave focusing mirror.\n\nThe partially focused beam was\n\ndirected to another flat mirror that steered the beam into the vacuum\nchamber. By adjusting the distance between the concave mirror and second\nflat mirror, the size of the laser spot incident on the KC1 entrance window\ncould be\n\nvaried.\n\nThis was done in order to reduce the diameter of the\n\nraw laser beam to a value that could be accepted by the final focusing\noptics located in the chamber.\n\nAn antireflection-coated f/1 germanium\n\nlens was used to finally focus the laser beam onto the pressure gauge or\nspecimen surface.\n\nIn order to have visual access to the specimen assembly\n\nduring the experiments, the vacuum chamber wall was built from clear\nplastic.\n\n20\n\nLaser beam\n\nWater\nSpecimen\nPlastic retainer rings\nBrass disc\nBrass retainer ring\n\nAluminum cylinder\nPressure\ntransducer\n\nFIGURE 7.\n\nTo oscilloscope\n\nPRESSURE GAUGE AND SPECIMEN ASSEMBLY\nUSED IN TEA-CO LASER EXPERIMENTS\n\n21\n\nFlat\nmirror\n\nFlat mirror\n\nKCI window\nGe lens\n\n*^\nWater\nsupply\n\nGauge and pressure\nholder (eg Fig 7 )\n\nPlastic container\nTo pump\n\nFIGURE 8.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENT OF TEA-C02 EXPERIMENTS\n\n22\n\n5J-Neodymium-Glass Laser Experiments.-At the 1.06 p,m wavelength of the neodymium-glass laser, initiation of laser supported\nabsorption waves was not a problem and for this reason the experiments\nwere conducted in air at ambient conditions.\n\nA previously reported\n\nmethod of enhancing the amplitude and duration of the laser generated\nshocks which involved placing materials that are transparent to the\nincident laser beam on the laser shocked surface was employed in all of\n(f\\ ft 9S^\nthe tests.\n"\nIn this case, the incident laser energy passes\nthrough the transparent overlay material and is absorbed at the surface\nof the metal specimen.\n\nThe stress wave is then generated at the speci-\n\nment surface and propagates into the specimen.\n\nThere are several\n\ncommonly available materials that are substantially transparent at the\n1.06 ( , wavelength.\njm\n\nWater was selected as a representative liquid\n\noverlay material, and fused quartz discs, 3 mm thick by 38 mm diameter,\nwere used as the solid overlay material.\nPressure measurements were made with the same type of tranducers\nused in the TEA-CO\xe2\x80\x9e experiments.\n\nAluminum targets were fabricated by\n\nvapor depositing 3 |lm of aluminum directly onto the surface electrode of\nthe quartz gauges.\n\nSince water and quartz are transparent overlay\n\nmaterials, the laser energy would be absorbed at the aluminum surface.\n\nIn\n\nthe case of the specimen shots, this was undesirable because the aluminum\nsurface would be disturbed by laser induced melting and vaporization.\nThis problem was solved by spraying a thin layer of black acrylic paint\non the specimen surface.\n\nUse of black paint for this purpose and its\n\neffect on the magnitude of the laser generated shock is reported elsewhere.\nThe brass disc-plastic retainer ring assembly used to hold the\npressure transducers and aluminum discs in the TEA-CO\n\nexperiments (eg.\n\nFigure 1) was used for the same purpose in the 5J neodymium-glass laser\nexperiments.\n\nThe holder shown in Figure 9 was used in the laser shocking\n\nexperiments of 1 mm-thick aluminum tensile specimens. They were placed in\na 4 mm-deep recess machined in the 10 mm-thick aluminum disc shown in\nFigure 9.\n\nThe specimens were pulled tight against the aluminum disc with\n\nscrews before being covered with approximately 2 mm of water. The plastic\nring surrounding the aluminum holder was pressed into the bottom end of the\n\n(1 8}\n\n23\n\nLaser beam\n\nFIGURE 9.\n\nHOLDER FOR TENSILE SPECIMENS LASER SHOCKED\nWITH THE 5J NEODYMIUM

window sealing the top end served purely\nas a confinement container to keep water and other debris from striking\nthe beam steering and focusing optics.\n\nBoth multiple (10 shots on a\n\ngiven area) and single shot irradiations were conducted with water\noverlays but only single shots were made on a given area with quartz\noverlays.\n500JKNeodymium-Glass\n\nLaser Experiments.-The experimental pro-\n\ncedure and overlay materials used in the very high power neodymium-glass\nlaser experiments were basically the same as the 5J laser tests.\n\nThe\n\nholder shown in Figure 9 was used in the experiments with water overlays.\nThe laser beam from the sixth amplifier was directed downward with a\ndielectric mirror and the beam was focused to the desired spot size with\na 1 m-focal length lens.\n\nBecause of the much larger energy available from\n\nthe CGE laser than the 5J system, it was possible to shock larger surface\nareas in a given pulse.\n\nAlso sufficient energy was available to laser\n\nshock some of the aluminum specimens in a split beam configuration.\nsetup is shown in Figure 11.\n\nThis\n\nThe laser energy from the sixth amplifier\n\nstage was divided into two approximately equal parts by the beam splitter\nshown in Figure 11.\n\nThe two beams were directed onto the specimen\n\nsurfaces by dielectric mirrors and focused to the desired spot size by\nthe 1 m-focal length lens.\n\nThe laser shocked aluminum tensile specimens!\n\ncoupons, and corrosion specimens were sandwiched between two 3 mm\xe2\x80\x94thick\nby 38 mm-diameter fused quartz discs.\n\nThese discs were pressed against\n\nthe surface of the aluminum specimens by 0-ring-loaded plastic retainer\nrings.\n\nThe split beam arrangement was particularily valuable in the laser\n\nexperiments with 3 mm-thick specimens since it allowed a more uniform\nshocking of the specimens through their thickness than was possible when\nthe specimens were shocked from one side only.\n\nBy simply removing the\n\nbeam splitter shown in Figure 11, it was possible to laser shock some of\nthe aluminum specimens on one surface only.\n\nIn all of these experiments,\n\nthe specimens were backed by an aluminum block at least 10 mm thick.\n\nThis\n\nwas done in order to avoid gross deformation of the specimen upon reflection\nof the stress wave from its back

transmission electron microscopy.\n\nThe mechanical\n\ntests consisted of microhardness measurements and tensile tests of\nshocked and unshocked specimens and the corrosion tests consisted of\ncrack initiation and propagation tests.\nMicrohardness.-The\n\nfirst few microhardness measurements were\n\nmade using a Knoop indenter (KHN) with a 100 gm load, but all subsequent\nmeasurements were made with the Vickers diamond pyramid indenter with a\n500 gm load because the Vicker\'s diamond pyramid hardness (DPH) tended\nto show less scatter.\n\nAll hardness readings were made on surfaces ground\n\nwith No. 600 paper, then mechanically polished.\non the TEA-CO, and 5J neodymium-glass\n\nIn the early measurements\n\nlaser irradiated specimens,\n\ninsufficient surface material was removed after machining and the higher\nmicrohardness reflects the machined surface properties.\n\nIt was subsequent-\n\nly found that if 75 ym or more were removed from the machined surface by\ngrinding with No. 600 paper before polishing, the microhardness decreased\nto the bulk value.\n\nFor example, for 2024-T351, the bulk microhardness\n\nafter grinding and polishing was 140 to 147 DPH, but the microhardness of\nlightly ground machined surfaces was 150 to 158 DPH.\n\nConsequently, most\n\nof the specimens used later for studies of the high energy laser effects\nhad 100 to 300 um removed from each surface by grinding with No. 600 paper\nbefore laser shocking.\n\nAfter shocking the surfaces were not ground\n\nfurther, but were mechanically polished only before taking

conducted at room temperature\n-4\nat a strain rate of 1.39 x 10 Is. The shocked specimens were either shocked\nfrom one side only (Figure 9) or on both sides simultaneously using the\nsplit beam arrangement (Figure 11).\n\nWhere possible, the laser spot size\n\nwas selected so that more than the 1.5 cm-long gauge section was covered\nin a single shot.\n\nFor the higher power densities or with split beam\n\nexperiments where this was not possible, the gauge length was covered with\ntwo or more ovelapping shots.\n\n28\n\nIn many instances, time and costs were saved by measuring\nsurface microhardness after shocking on the gage length of tensile\nspecimens.\n\nThe microhardness indentations appeared to slightly\n\ndecrease the elongation and reduction in area but otherwise had no\ndiscernable influence on the tensile results as shown in Table II.\nTransmission electron metallography.-Thin foils for transmission\nmicroscopy of the unshocked and shocked materials were prepared by grinding the specimens from both sides to about 75 ym-thickness.\n\nThese thin\n\nspecimens were then electrochemically thinned using a solution of 67\npercent methanol, 33 percent HNO\n\ncooled in a methanol and dry ice bath.\n\nThe shocked microstruetures were all taken from coupons shocked with the\nsplit beam method (Figure 11), are representative of the middle of the\nspecimen thickness, and do not reflect near-surface shock deformation.\nCorrosion tests.-Specimens for the corrosion investigations,\nincluding the tensile specimens, were all laser shocked from both sides\nwith the 500J neodymium-glass laser using the split beam technique, and\nblack paint plus fused quartz overlays.\nExperimental techniques to determine the effect of laser\nshocking on corrosion behavior can be divided into three groups:\nelectrochemical measurements in 3.5% NaCl; crack initiation experiments\nunder alternate immersion in 3.5% NaCl; and crack propagation measurements\nduring complete immersion in 3.5% NaCl solution.\nElectrochemical measurements.-The corrosion resistance of shocked\nand unshocked specimens was determined by potentiodynamic\ntechniques in aerated 3.5% NaCl solution.\napparatus used is shown in Figure 12.\n\nA schematic diagram of the\n\nThe specimen was completely\n\nmasked off with a lacquer coating apart from a region in the center of the\nspecimen.\n\nThe unmasked region corresponded only to the laser irradiated\n\narea in the shocked specimens.\n\nThe specimen was degreased with ethyl\n\nalcohol, then placed in the solution so that the unmasked area was submerged and electrical connection was made to the masked area outside the\nsolution by a crocodile clip.\n\nTABLE II.\n\nCondition\n\nCOMPARISON OF TENSILE PROPERTIES WITH AND WITHOUT\nMICROHARDNESS IMPRESSIONS IN THE GAUGE LENGTH IN\n2024-T351 ALUMINUM3\n\n0.2% offset\nyield strength\nMN/m2\n\nUltimate tensile\nstrength,\nMN/m2\n\nUniform\nelongation,\npercent\n\nTotal\nelongation,\npercent\n\nReduction\nin area,\npercent\n\nSmooth\n\n360.6\n\n+1.4\n\n474.4\n\n0.7\n\n20.3\n\n0.8\n\n22.5\n\n1.3\n\n12.4\n\n0.8\n\nHardness impressions\n\n356.5\n\n+4.8\n\n473.0\n\n7.6\n\n17.4\n\n0.6\n\n19.0\n\n0.1\n\n7.0\n\n1.2\n\nThe specimens were 1 mm thick and the strain rate was 1.39 x 10 * sec\nspecimens for the smooth and indented specimens respectively.\n\n.\n\nThe results are the averages of 2 and 3\n\nto\n\nSPECIMEN\n\nOJ\n\no\n\nCALOMEL\nREFERENCE\nELECTRODE\nCOUNTER ELECTRODE\n\nLUGGIN PROBE\nFIGURE 12.\n\nSCHEMATIC DIAGRAM OF ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL ASSEMBLY\n\n31\n\nThe potential of the specimen was measured against the external saturated calomel electrode, and controlled by current passed by the\npotentiostat through the platinum counter electrode.\n\nThe potentiostat\n\nsignal input was governed by a motor-driven potentiometer which scanned\nat a rate of 5 V/hour,\n\nThe current was measured by monitoring the\n\npotential developed across a standard resistor, and processing the\npotential through a logarithmic amplifer.\n\nThe output from the amplifier\n\nwas applied to the X channel of an X-Y recorder:\nspecimen was applied to the Y channel.\n\nthe potential of the\n\nThe potential scan was started\n\nat -0.9 V\n\nand moved in the noble (positive) direction to -0.4 V, when\nSLE\nthe scan direction was reversed.

After irradiation with the TEA-CO,., laser\nthrough the 2 mm-thick water overlay, the pitting shown in Figure 19 was\nobserved on the surface of all the specimens.\n\nThis pitting was attributed\n\nto the interaction of the pressure wave with gas bubbles at the waterspecimen interface.\n\nUnless special precautions are taken, it is very\n\ndifficult to eliminate small bubbles clinging to the specimen surface.\nThe 10.6 | , wavelength radiation of the C0~ laser is absorbed near the\nam\nsurface of the water layer, generating the pressure wave in the water\nlayer, which then propagates down through the water-specimen interface\nand into the aluminum specimen.\n\nThus, any gas bubbles at the water-metal\n\ninterface will be collapsed onto the surface of the specimen by the pressure wave, and the resulting impact creates a pit in the aluminum surface.\nIt is clear from Figure 19 b and c that there is severe plastic\ndeformation even to the extent of ductile tearing of material from the\ncenter and rim of several of the pits.\n\nSimilar effects have been observed\n\non a larger scale for liquid jet impact on a soft metal surface; but the\ndefamation seen in Figure 19 is more severe than in the liquid jet impact\n(29 30)\ncraters.\nThus, the impact conditions generated here were of greater\nintensity than those created by the liquid jets used to simulate bubble\ncollapse.\n\nThe isolation of the individual cavities and the opportunity to\n\nmeasure or control bubble size, magnitude of the pressure wave and specimen material could present an opportunity to study the fundamental aspects\nof cavitation under controlled conditions.\n\n5J Neodymium-Glass Laser-Induced\nShock Effects on the Material\nMechanical properties.- One mm-thick discs and tensile specimens\nwere irradiated on one surface with the 5J glass laser.\n\nBecause of the low\n\nenergy of laser, the spot diameter was limited to 5 mm maximum, and therefore\n5 overlapping shots were required to cover the 1.5 cm-long gauge length of\nthe tensile specimens\n\n(Figure 5).\n\nFigure 20a shows the surface appearance of\n\nthe tensile specimen after laser shocking, but before the black paint overlay\nwas removed.\n\nFIGURE 19.\n\nSURFACE OF 2024-T851 ALUMINUM AFTER IRRADIATION WITH THE C02 TEA\nLASER. 10 shots were made on this area with a 2 nun-thick water\noverlay, an energy density of 109 J/cm2, and a pulse length of\n500 ns over a spot size of 1 cm diameter.\n\n46\n\na.\n\n5J Nd-glass laser, black paint plus water overlay,\n5 overlapping shots.\n\nb.\n\n500J Nd-glass laser, black paint plus quartz\noverlay, 1 shot.\n\nFIGURE 20.\n\nSURFACE APPEARANCE OF TENSILE SPECIMENS AFTER LASER SHOCKING\nBUT BEFORE THE BLACK PAINT OVERLAY WAS REMOVED\n\n47\n\nThe influence of the low energy laser on the surface hardness of\nthe alloys is shown in Tables III and IV.\n\nTable III compares the effect\n\nof multiple (10) shots with a black paint plus water overlay to that of\na single shot with a black paint plus quartz overlay on 2024-T851.\nenvironment had any discernable effect on hardness.\n\nNeither\n\nThe results for 2024-\n\nT351 and 7075-T651 (Table IV) also show that any change in hardness is well\nwithin the specimen-to-specimen scatter.\n\nThe higher front surface hardness\n\nof the 2024-T351 tensile specimen shocked with an energy density of 26.8 x\n4\n2\n10 J/m is attributed to a machining-hardened layer still present on this\nspecimen.\nThe tensile results indicate that there may be a very slight\nincrease in tensile strength after shocking.\n\nThe yield and tensile\n\nstrengths for all the alloys lie above the unshocked averages.\n\nThe total\n\nelongations were unchanged, but the reductions in area were decreased,\nexcept for the 2024-T351.\n\nIt will be shown later, that the estimated peak\n\npressures of about 1.5 GPa estimated from Figure 18 are too low to produce\nsignificant hardening.\nSurface effects. - If the black paint is too thin, the laser\nbeam can vaporize the paint and begin to interact with the bare metal surface\nunderneath.\n\nExamples of this are the bare spots in the gauge length of the\n\ntensile specimen in Figure 20 where the more intense central portion of\nthe beam has penetrated the black paint.\n\nIn this case the interaction was\n\nnot long enough to melt the specimen surface.\n\nAn example where the beam\n\nhad burned away the paint sufficiently to locally melt the surface is\nshown in Figure 21.\n\nIn Figure 21 a, the scribed circle outlines the spot\n\nsize, and the dark central region is shown at higher magnification in\nFigures 21 b and c.\n\nThe vaporization accompanying the melting creates\n\nturbulence in the melted metal film which is quenched-in during the rapid\ncooling by the metal substrate when the beam is turned off.\nthe roughened appearance of the melted surface (Figure 21 c).\n\nThis causes\nWhere the\n\nblack paint protected the specimen surface, no melting occurred and the preexisting grind marks are preserved intact (Figures 21 a and b).\n\nTABLE IV.\n\nPower\ndensity,\nW/m2\n\nNumber\nof shots0\n\nSUMMARY OF TENSILE AND HARDNESS RESULTS FOR SHOCKING 2024 AND 7075\nALUMINUM WITH THE 5J Nd-GLASS LASER AKD BLACK PAINT PLUS WATER\nOVERLAY3\n\n0.2% offset\nyield strength^,\nMN/m2\n\nUltimate\ntensile\nstrength^,\nMN/m2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nTctai\nelongation,\nperce.r.t\n\nReduction\nin area,\npercent\n\nAverage hardness, DPH\nUnshocked\nShocked\nsurface\nregion\n\nBack\nsurface6\n\n2024-\'j\'331\n0\n\nNone\n13\n\n0.67 x 10\n0.59\n\n5\n50\n\n356.5 \xc2\xb1 4.8\n368.2\n364.7\n\n473.0 \xc2\xb1 7.6\n\n19.0 \xc2\xb1 Q.I\n\n7.0 + 1.1\n\n483.3\n484.0\n\n18.0\n21.2\n\n12.3\n12.5\n\n151.9 \xc2\xb1 4.3\n149.0 \xc2\xb1 2.2\n\n156.3 i 6.4\n142.5 \xc2\xb1 4.5\n\n148.9 \xc2\xb1 3.8\n\n158.4 \xc2\xb1 6.2\n154.7 \xc2\xb15.6\n\n200.0 \xc2\xb1 3.6\n197.8 \xc2\xb1 5.8\n\n2024-T851\n0\n\nNone\n13\n\n0.67 x 10\n\n0.39\n\n5\n50\n\n445.4 \xc2\xb1 4.1\n459.2\n454.4\n\n483.3 \xc2\xb1 2.8\n495.1\n493.7\n\n9.0 \xc2\xb1 0.2\n8.2\n9.0\n\n4.1 \xc2\xb1 0.3\n2.6\n\n157.8 \xc2\xb1 4.3\n\n2.4\n\n155.8 \xc2\xb1 3.5\n\n155.8 \xc2\xb1 6.1\n156.2 \xc2\xb1 4.0\n\n193.7 \xc2\xb1 4.6\n195.7 \xc2\xb1 3.6\n\n194.1 \xc2\xb1 3.8\n196.9 \xc2\xb1 5.5\n\n707S-T651\nNone\n13\n\n0.67 x 10\n0.58\n\n0\n5\n50\n\n531.6 \xc2\xb10.7\n543.3\n541.3\n\n580.6 + 2.0\n584.7\n586.8\n\n14.6 :: C.I\n\n14.9 \xc2\xb1 1.1\n\n14,2\n\n10.0\n\n14 . 9\n\n12.2\n\n0.5 cm spot diameter, 40 ns pulse length, specimen 1 mm thick.\nVickers microhardness using a 500 gm load.\n\nEach hardness is the average of at least 10 readings.\n\nC\n\nThis is the number of shots on the gage length.

A range of power densities was investigated using 2024-T351 with black paint plus quartz overlays, plus one\nexperiment with black paint plus water overlay.\n\nSubsequently, 2024-T851\n\nand 7075 were studied at the higher power density levels.\n\nMost of the\n\nexperiments were conducted on 1 mm-thick material, but some 3 mm-thick\nmaterial was laser shocked to investigate the effect of thickness.\n2024-T351. - The microhardness and tensile results are shown in\nTables V and VI for 1 mm- and 3 mm- thick specimens, respectively.\n\nThe\n\nsurface microhardness before shocking was in the range of 140 to 145 DPH.\nAny unshocked hardnesses higher than this probably reflect some retained\nmachining damage.\n\nWhere hardness and tensile strength are on the same\n\nline in the Tables, they were measured on the same specimen.\n\nFor single\n\nbeam laser irradiation, the front surface is the shocked surface.\n\nThe back\n\nsurface readings were taken on the other surface, opposite the laser shocked\nregion.\n\nFor the split beam irradiation, both the front and back readings\n\nwere taken in the laser shocked regions.\n\nThe "unshocked" readings were\n\ntaken on one of the irradiated surfaces, but outside the shocked region.\nWhen the unshocked reading was measured on only one surface of a split beam\nirradiated specimen, all hardness values are on the same line of the Table,\nbut when a separate unshocked hardness reading was made on each shocked\nsurface, the unshocked and shocked readings for each surface are paired on\nsuccessive lines, e.g., readings for 2024-T851 in Table VI.\nThe microhardness and tensile strength would be expected to\nincrease with increasing laser peak power or energy density, since the\nmagnitude (Figure 18) or duration of the shock pressure will often increase\nwith these quantities.\n\nThe dependence of surface hardness on laser peak\n\npower and energy density for 2024-T351 is shown in Figures 22 a and b.\n\nThe\n\nTABLE V.\n\nType of\nirradiation\n\nPower\ndensity,\nW/m 2\n\nSUMMARY Of TENSILE AND HAKDNKSS P\'.\'SULTS FOR 2024 AND 7075 ALUMINUM ALLOYS\n1 mm THICK USING THE 500 .1 Kd- CLASS LASER AND BLACK PAINT PLUS QUARTZ\nOVERLAY0\n\nPulse\nlength,\nns\n\nPeak\npressure,\nCiPa\n\n0.2% oifset\nttnsile\nstrength,\nMN/m 2\n\n111 fU\'.-ite\ntaLiijila\nsjtreiigLh,\nX\\/ir>\n\nTotal\nelongation,\npercent\n\nReduction\nin area,\npercent\n\nAverage 1 ardness, DPH\xc2\xb0\nUnshocked\nFront\nregion\nsurface\n\nBack\nsurface\n\n2024-T351\nNone\nSingle biiC:i\nSingle beam\nSingle beam\nSingle b?.am\nSplit beam\nSplJ-l: bean\nSplit beam\nSplit beam\n\nNone\n1.12 x 101-3\n2.30 x 1013\n2.10 x 1013\n1.13 x 1013\n1.34 b x 1013\n1.48,0.87 x 101J\ni . < i b , 0.85 x ID 1\n1,26 x 10\n1.12 x 1013\n1.09, 1.18 x ICi\n\n356.5 \xc2\xb1 4.8\n356.5\n385.4\n345.4\n\n31\n31\nSO\n\n2.6\n5.5\n\n52\n31\n37\n37\n\n2.3\n3.5, 2.0\n3.5, 2 , 0\n3.0\n2.6\n2.6, 2 . 8\n\n52\n\n47.3.0 .t 7.6\n471.6\n\xe2\x80\xa2 475 8\n45\'. .6\n\n19.0 \xc2\xb1 0.1\n17.0\n14.8\n13.3\n\n7.0 i 1.1 143.6 \xc2\xb1 4.7\n7.0\n143.7 \xc2\xb1 6.6\n14.6\n145.4 \xc2\xb1 4.8\n152.2 \xc2\xb1 3.7\n18.3\n\n367.5\n367.5\n380.6\n\n4<;2.G\nsS4.0\n42f.ii\n\n19.6\n18.2\n13.9\n\n6.7\n9.3\n13.0\n\n384.7\n\n4/9,2\n\n12.3\n\n22.1\n\ni\n\n142.1 \xc2\xb1 3.0\n151.8 \xc2\xb1 3.3\n150.9 \xc2\xb1 3.4\n148.4 \xc2\xb1 1.4\n149.5 \xc2\xb1 4.4\n146.0 \xc2\xb1 4 . 4\n\n- -\'\n\n151.3\n157.7\n161.4\n149.5\n152.7\n151.9\n162.3\n168.4\n\n\xc2\xb1 5.5\n\xc2\xb1 4.2\n\xc2\xb1 4.1\n\xc2\xb1 3.2\n\xc2\xb1 4.6\n\xc2\xb1 4.3\n\xc2\xb1 5.6\n\xc2\xb1 12.0\n\n154.7 \xc2\xb1 5.0\n154.8 \xc2\xb1 3.8\n150.2 \xc2\xb1 3.7\n145.9 \xc2\xb1 3.2\n148.9 \xc2\xb1 2.5\n155.6 \xc2\xb1 4.4\n\n150.2 +\n\n4.1\n\n161.7 \xc2\xb1 4 . 5\n149.9 + 3 . 6\n\n4.1 \xc2\xb1 0.3\n153.6 + 3.9\n4.6\n5 7\n155 3 4- 2 6\n\n155.9 \xc2\xb1\n154 8 +\n\n3.5\n4.2\n\n156.2 \xc2\xb1 4.3\n153.0 + 1.6\n\n14.9 \xc2\xb1 1.1\n192.8 + 2.0\n17.5\n188.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7\n15.3\n8.0\n195.1 i 3.8\n\n199.6 +\n192.3 \xc2\xb1\n195.2 \xc2\xb1\n\n7.1\n4.7\n5.4\n\n193.1 \xc2\xb1 4.6\n182.6 \xc2\xb1 2.8\n192.2 \xc2\xb1 4.3\n\n11.7 \xc2\xb1 0.6\n11.5\n\n154.4 \xc2\xb1\n\n3.1\n\n150.5 \xc2\xb1 4.4\n\n2024-T851\nSingle beam\nSplit beam\nt \xe2\x80\x94 -\xe2\x80\x94 -\xe2\x80\x94.\n\nNone\n1.88 x 1013\n1.44, 0.5 x 1013\n\n37\n37\n\n4.5\n3.4,\n\n2.0\n\n445.4 \xc2\xb1 4 . 1 \'.8J.3 J. 2.8\n447.5\n492,3\n435.J\n;

The\nlines connect the points for opposite surface on\nsplit beam shots.\n\n54\n\npoint for the black paint plus water overlay was plotted at the equivalent\npower density required for the quartz overlay to reach the same peak pressure using Figure 18.\n\nThe surface hardness increases with increasing peak\n\npower density (Figure 22 a) and tends to saturate at peak power densities\n13\n2\nabove 1.5 x 10 W/m . There is not much spread in the range of power\ndensities investigated, since at the higher energy densities the pulse\n*\nlengths were longer (Table V). The points at higher power densities in\nFigure 22 suggest a saturation of the hardening.\n\nAn idea of the range of\n\nhardness attainable is given by the "hammered surface" hardness level,\nobtained by heavily hammering the specimen surface, then polishing it\nbefore measuring the microhardness.\nThe dependence of surface hardness on the energy density (Figure\n22 b) is similar, except there is a more pronounced sigmoidal shape to the\ncurve, suggesting a threshold shock pressure for surface hardening to occur.\nIn this figure the higher energy densities correspond to the longer pulse\nlength shots.\nA good perspective of the laser shocking results can be had by\ncomparing them with results obtained by shocking similar material with a\nflyer plate.\n\nHerring and Olson\n\nshocked 2024 aluminum in different heat\n\ntreated conditions with a thin mylar flyer plate, producing a range of shock\npressures of 150 nsec duration.\n\nOne of their heat treat conditions was\n\nsolution treated plus aged one hour at 463\n\nK (190\n\nC).\n\nThis is an under-\n\naged condition which should approximate the solution treated and natural\ncondition studied here, T351.\n\nThe unshocked hardnesses of these two materials\n\nare in good agreement (Figure 23 a).\n\nA comparison of the average hardness\n\nresults is presented in Figure 23 a with the laser power densities converted\nto peak pressures from Figure 18.\n\nAlthough there is a large variation, taken\n\nas a whole the laser shock results fall on the rapid strain hardening portion\n\nThe laser peak power density is obtained by dividing the laser energy\ndensity by the pulse length. This is a good approximation since the laser\npulse is triangular in shape and the given pulse length is the pulse width\nat one-half the maximum intensity.\n\n55\n\n190\n\nO Block paint\nplus quartz\nA Black paint\nplus water\n\n5\n\n10\n\nPeak Pressure, GPa\na.\n\n2024-T351\n\n190\n\no Laser shocking\na Flyer plate shocking\n5\n\n10\n\nPeak Pressure ,GPa\nb.\n\nFIGURE 23.\n\n2024-T851\n\nDEPENDENCE OF SURFACE HARDNESS OF 2024 ALUMINUM ON\nSHOCK WAVE PEAK PRESSURE FROM FIGURE 18 COMPARED\nTO SURFACE HARDNESS FROM FLYER PLATE-INDUCED SHOCK\nPRESSURES TAKEN FROM HERRING AND OLSON^11).

increased peak pressure when shocking with\n(31 32)\na flyer plate.\nLaser-induced shock waves have the same shape as the\nlaser pulse (Figure 17), so the shock pulse length is approximately equal\nto the laser pulse length written along side each point in Figure 23.\nInspection of these points in Figure 23 a shows that the hardnesses produced by the 37 nsec pulses all lie above those from both longer and shorter\npulses, although the longer-duration flyer plate shock-induced hardnesses\nlie above shorter-duration laser shock-induced hardnesses.\n\nThis suggests\n\nthat there may be an optimum laser pulse length for surface hardening, in\nthe neighborhood of 37 nsec.\nThis might be caused by the thermal effects associated with the\nlaser-material interaction.\n\nAlthough the thermal effects are limited, heat\n\nis conducted into the specimen from the surface to a depth depending on the\nlaser pulse length.\n\nAn approximation of the depth, d, of the penetration\n\nof the thermal effects is given by d = 2/kt, where k is the thermal diffusivity of 2024 aluminum and t is the time.\n\nIgnoring the insulating\n\n2\neffect of the remaining intervening film of paint, taking k = 0.45 cm /sec\n*\nand t = pulse length , d = 2.1 ym for a 25 nsec pulse and 3.8 urn for an\n80 nsec pulse.\nThe hardness impressions were about 20 ym deep and therefore\nsampled only a surface layer of that depth.\n\nThe depth of the thermal\n\neffect for the 80 nsec pulse is too small in itself to have much effect\non the hardness readings.\n\nBut for the long pulse shots there is a possi-\n\nbility that a long term, i.e., many microsecond duration, laser emission\nprocess occurs prior to arrival of the main laser pulse.\n\n*\n\nThis amplified\n\nt could be nearly twice as long as the stated pulse length if the surface\nis at an elevated temperature during the entire exposure to the beam.\n\n57\nspontaneous emission of laser radiation would heat the surface for a period\nof many microseconds before the main pulse interacts with the target.\n\nA\n\nheating pulse of several microseconds duration would create a heat-affected\nzone 20 ym or more deep, deeper than the hardness impression.\n\nIn addition\n\nthis effect would substantially decrease the peak pressure generated by the\nmain pulse, limiting the hardening obtainable.\n\nThus for the longer pulse,\n\nthe thermal effects could extend into the material for some distance, but\nits effects would be significant for only a fraction of this distance, near\nthe surface.\n\nThe longer pulse length (150 nsec) of the flyer plate experi-\n\nments would not show this effect because the only thermal effect is adiabatic\nshock heating, which is small at these pressures.\nThe yield strength is a measure of the in-depth changes in material\nproperties and will be less influenced by the magnitude of surface hardening\nthan by the depth to which strain hardening extends into the specimens.\nFor in-depth property changes, the hardness should be uniform across most\nof the spot diameter and extend well into the material.\n\nThe variation of\n\nhardness across several different laser spots are shown in Figures 24 and\n25 a and d.\n\nThe surface hardness increase is satisfactorily uniform over\n\nmost of the irradiated area in each of these specimens, except for somewhat\nmore scatter in Figure 25 a.\n\nThe hardness distributions within the speci-\n\nmens are somewhat less uniform (Figure 25 c) along the spot diameter.\n\nThis\n\neffect can be overcome by overlapping successive laser shots.\nThe depth of hardening will depend on the depth to which the peak\nshock pressures can be kept well above the dynamic yield strength.\n\nOne way\n\nthis can be done is to increase the duration of the pressure pulse.\n\nThe\n\npeak pressure of the relatively short laser induced shock wave decays\nrapidly as the wave travels into the specimen, primarily because the rarefaction wave (the trailing part of the pressure wave having a decreasing\npressure in Figure 17) travels faster than the shock wave (the leading\npart of the pressure wave having an increasing pressure in Figure\n\n17), (33)\n\nsoon overtaking it and decreasing the shock pressure below the dynamic yield\nstrength.\n\nThe short laser-induced shock pulses and the short flyer plate\n\nshock waves\n\ndecay within a few millimeters, causing a gradient of de-\n\ncreasing hardness into the specimen from the shock hardened surface.\nThis effect can be mitigated to some extent by shocking opposite\nsurfaces simultaneously with a split laser beam.\n\nThis has two effects.\n\n58\n\n180\nX\nCL\nQ\n\n160\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0>\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n"\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2

if this is above the dynamic yield strength, further\ndeformation strain hardening is produced in the center of the thickness.\nA schematic drawing of the total shock pressure profile through\nthe thickness of a 1 mm-thick specimen when the two shock waves interact\nis shown in Figure 26 a.\n\nAlthough this is a highly simplified illustration,\n\nit shows that shock pressures in the center of thinner specimens can be\nlarger than the surface pressures.\n\nThe hardness through a 1 mm-thick speci-\n\nmen after shocking with a split laser beam is shown in Figure 26 b.\n\nThe\n\nmeasurements were made on the surface of a transverse section cut through\nthe specimen along the diameter of the laser spot.\n\nThe hardness at each\n\ndistance through the thickness of the specimen is an average of ten readings.\nIt is obvious that there is substantial hardening at the midpoint of the\nthickness, consistent with the suggested pressure profile (Figure 26 a),\nand also a minimum hardness well above the unshocked hardness.\n\nThis effect\n\ncan also be used in thicker specimens, except that the peak pressures of\nthe impinging Shockwaves will be lower than shown in Figure 26 a when they\nmeet in the center, so the hardening will not be as great.\n\nThe varia-\n\ntion of hardness through the 3 mm-thick specimen in Figure 25 in the center\nof the shocked region is shown in Figure 27.\n\nAlthough the specimen is\n\nrelatively thick, there was an increase in hardness in the center of the\nthickness.\n\nThus for substantial in-depth hardening of metals, an arrange-\n\nment such as a split beam should be employed.\nThe yield strength results are plotted in Figures 28 a and b for\n1 mm-thick specimens only.\n\nAt a given power density, the split beam shots\n\ntend to give higher yield strengths and the longer pulse durations give\nsuccessively higher yield strengths.\n\nThe longest duration (80 nsec) pulse\n\nactually decreased the strength below the initial strength.\n\nThe reason for\n\nthis is not clear, but could be caused by the heating effect discussed\nearlier for the hardness results.\n\nThe thermal effects should not extend\n\nvery deep into the specimen as calculated above and therefore would not be\nexpected to affect the bulk shock hardening to the same degree suggested earlier\nfor surface hardening.\n\nIt is expected that thermal

(13) This differs from the\nbehavior of pure aluminum, which shows a dislocation cell structure after\ncold rolling, but after shocking may show either a uniform distribution of\ndislocation tangles,\n\n\'\n\ncontrary to what is expected on the basis of a\n\nhigh stacking fault metal, or a cellular dislocation substructure.\n2024-T851. - This condition is artifically aged to a higher\nstrength level than the naturally aged 2024-T351 (compare unshocked strength\nand hardness in Tables V and VI).\n\nNone of the laser shocking conditions\n\nsignificantly raised either the hardness or yield strength.\n\nThe reason\n\nfor this can be seen in Figure 23 b, where the dependence of surface hardness on peak pressure is plotted for the laser shocking and flyer plate\nshocking results.\n\nThe flyer plate shocking studies were conducted on\n\npeak aged 2024-T6 material (12 h at 463\xc2\xb0 K) which compares with the T851\ncondition (10 h at 463\n\nK).\n\nmaterials (Figure 23 b).\n\nThe initial hardness is similar for the two\n\nA high threshold pressure is necessary to get\n\nshock hardening in this aged condition.\n\nUnfortunately, the threshold pres-\n\nsure of 8.0 GPa is well above the highest laser-generated pressures and this is\nthe reason for the lack of laser shock hardening in Figure 23b.\nPulse length has no effect within the range covered.\nThe total elongation is increased slightly by shocking, but the\nreduction of area is increased.\nThe substructure after shocking at a peak pressure of 2.6 GPa\ncontains a uniform distribution of dislocations (Figure 30 b), but the dislocation density has not increased significantly relative to the unshocked\nconditions (Figure 2 b).\n\nA similar result, but with an apparently high dis-\n\nlocation density after shocking, was reported for 2024-T6.\nThe reason for the different shock hardening response of the T351\nand T851 conditions can be found in the strain hardening behavior observed\nin the tensile tests.\n\nThe difference between the yield strength and ultimate\n\nstrength gives a crude comparison of the strain hardening rates between the\ntwo conditions.\n\nThe T851 condition has a much higher yield strength, but\n\n68\n\nonly a slightly higher ultimate strength than the T351 condition (Table V).\nThus not only are higher shock pressures required to cause plastic deformation, but for a given amount of shocking strain introduced into the material,\nthe subsequent flow stress of the T351 condition will be raised by a larger\namount than that of T851.\n7075-T651. - 7075-T651 is in the.peak aged condition (Figure 4 a).\nThere is slight surface hardening (Tables V and VI) for all conditions, except for the split beam on 1 mm-thick specimens.\n\nThe highest surface hard13\n2\nness was produced by the shot with the highest power density (1.87 x 10 " W/m )\nLaser shock hardening had little effect on the tensile properties\nof this alloy, but did have a tendency to increase the tensile strength\nslightly, with some decrease in total elongation and little effect on the\nreduction in area, except to increase the scatter.\n\nFairand et al. found\n\nthat laser shocking at a peak pressure of 3.0 GPa decreased the yield and\nultimate strength of 7075-T6 by about 4% with no effect on elongation.\nJacobs reported that shocking 7075-T6 at 20.4 GPa with a driver plate increased the yield strength by 147o and the ultimate strength by 57o in one\ncase and decreased both by 67\xc2\xb0 and 127=, respectively, in another case, which\n()\n2\nhe attributed to improper cooling after shocking.\nIn this study, the\npeak pressures ranged from 2.1 to 4.5 GPa, and only the 3.5 GPa shot\npossibly decreased the tensile strength, although the total variation of\nyield strength between all the conditions is only 37\xc2\xbb.\nThis limited response to shock hardening can be related to the\nlow strain hardening rate .and high yield strength of the T651 condition\nsimilar to the 2024-T851 aluminum.\n\nThe shock treatment does introduce a\n\nsubstantial number of dislocations as shown in Figure 31 a (compare to\nFigure 4 a).\n\nThe substructure is composed of a relatively uniform distri-\n\nbution of dislocations with some tendency to form bands of dislocations.\n()\n2\nThis was also observed by Jacobs\nexcept that after shocking at 20.4 GPa,\nthe substructure was finer and more dense.\n7075-T73. - This overaged condition responded well to shock\nhardening, as expected from a previous study of laser shocking in 7075\naluminum.\n\nThe surface hardness was increased only slightly after\n\n69\n\nshocking at 2.8 GPA but the yield and tensile strengths were increased by\n157o and 107=, respectively, with no loss in ductility.\n\nFairand et al.\n\nreported an increase of 297\xc2\xbb and 147o after shocking with a peak pressure\nof 4.0 to 5.4 GPa, but their material was aged to a lower initial yield\n2\nstrength, 345 MN/m . In contrast, after shocking at 20.4 GPa the yield\nstrength and ultimate strength were increased by only 1170 and 370, respec()\n2\ntively.\nThus it appears that most of the shock hardening of 7075-T73\nis reached at relatively low peak shock pressures and the strengthening\namounts to about 157o to 3070 increase above the unshocked strength.\n\nThere\n\nwas no decrease in elongation in this study (Table V), but the other investigations reported decreases in elongation after shocking.\n\n\'\n\nThe interesting characteristic of the shocked microstructure is\nthat the dislocation substructure is much finer and denser in this material\n(Figure 31 b) than in the other three materials (Figures 31 a and 30 a and b),\neven though the peak pressure was nominally only 2.6 GPa.\n\nThe banding im-\n\nplied in Figure 31 a is quite obvious in this condition (Figure 31 b). This\n()\n2\nbanding has not been previously reported in shocked 7075 aluminum,\nbut\n(13)\nhas been observed in an Al-Cu-Mg alloy at 5.0 GPa.\nThe high dislocation\ndensity probably accounts for the substantial increase in ultimate tensile\nstrength, which was not observed in any of the other three materials.\n\nThe\n\nyield strength of the shocked 7075-T73 specimen is higher than the ultimate\ntensile strength of the unshocked specimens (Table V).\n\nAlso even with this\n\nmagnitude of strain hardening, the surface hardening was very small, an\ninteresting exception to the correlations between hardness and flow\n/ O Q\n\nstress,\nstress\n\nQ / \\\n\n\'\n\nwhich works reasonably well for the 2024 aluminum in this\n\nstudy.\nOne possible explanation for the yield strength of the shocked\nmaterial being higher than the ultimate strength of the unshocked material\nis that the total transient strain imposed on the specimen during shocking\nis larger than the total tensile elongation.\n\nThe material would then be\n\nstrain hardened beyond the range it could reach in a tensile test, so the\ntensile yield strength after shocking would equal the flow stress at some\n\na.\n\nJ/m2\n\nb.\n\nFIGURE 31.\n\n7075-T65 shocked at power densities of 1.17 and 1.08 x 10\non each side respectively.\n7075-T73 shocked at power densities of 1.14 and 1.05 x 1013\non each side respectively.\n\nJ/m2\n\nMICROSTRUCTURES OF 7075 ALUMINUM AFTER LASER SHOCKING. 3 mm-thick coupons shocked\non both surfaces simultaneously with a black paint plus quartz overlay and a 52 nsec\npulse length.\n\n71\n\nstrain level higher than that reached at the ultimate strength of unshocked\nmaterial.\n\nThe total true transient strain can be calculated using the\n(35)\nrelation by Dieter\n\neT = 3 l n v\no\n\n(1)\n\n\'\n\nwhere v is the volume of the alloy at the peak shock pressure, 2.6 GPa,\nand v\n\nis the volume at ambient pressure.\n\nThe calculation gives e\n\n= 0.041\n\ncompared to measured elongation at the ultimate strength of unshocked material\nof e = 0.084 + 0.004.\n\nThus, the shock-induced strain more effectively hardens\n\nthe material than an equivalent tensile strain.\n\nA similar effect was ob-\n\nserved in 2024-T3 when comparing eT to strain introduced by cold rolling.\n\n(12)\n\nSurface Effects. - The surface of specimens of all alloys showed\nsimilar features after shocking.\n\nThese appeared to be slight distortions on\n\nthe smoothly ground surface in the form of small regions raised above the\nsurrounding surface (Figure 32 b).\n\nThe number and distinctness of these\n\nfeatures varied from specimen to specimen, and the example shown in Figure 32\ncontains the more pronounced types of those observed.\n\nA talysurf scan across\n\nthese features showed them to be small "hillocks" surrounded by a depressed\nrim (Figure 33).\n\nThe three bumps of the surface profile in Figure 32 cor-\n\nrespond to the large hillock and the double hillock along the traverse\ngoing from A to B, illustrated in Figure 32 b.\n\nThe paint overlay was intact\n\nafter shocking and there was no correlation between any features on the paint\nfilm and the location of the hillocks.\n\n(Compare 32 a and 32 b.)\n\nSEM of\n\nthe surface showed no sign of melting in the area of the hillocks (Figure\n32 c).\n\nIt is believed that these features were produced by local variations in the pressure environment during shocking, which caused the surface\nto be mechanically distorted.\n\nThe pressure variations most likely originate\n\nfrom local variations of intensity within the laser beam, but it is possible\nthat compositional inhomogeneities in the paint might also contribute\nthrough local differences in absorption of energy from the beam.\n\n-J\nto\n\nb.\n\na.\na.\n\nAfter removal of paint, showing the direction\nand line of the surface contour traverse\ndrawn in Figure 33\n\nc.\nFIGURE 32.\n\nAfter shocking, before removal of paint\n\nb.\n\nc.\n\nSEM of the surface of a hillock\n\nSURFACE OF A 2024-T351 COUPON AFTER IRRADIATION WITH BLACK PAINT PLUS\nQUARTZ OVERLAY AT A POWER DENSITY OF 1.62 x 101J W/mz AND A PULSE\nLENGTH OF 25 nsec.\n\n73\n\nE 25\nb 20\nc\no\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nDistance, cm\n\nFIGURE 33.\n\nSURFACE CONTOUR ALONG LINE AB\nBEGINNING AT A IN FIGURE 32\n\n1.0\n\n74\n\nThese features cause a surface roughening of less than 10 | ,\njm\n(Figure 33), and if they were considered undesirable in an application because of possible adverse effects on fatigue or some other property, they\ncould easily be removed in a light finishing operation.\n\n75\n\n500-J Neodymium-Glass Laser-Induced\nShock Effects on Stress Corrosion Cracking\nThe laser beam peak power density was measured for each specimen;\n13\n2\nthe mean values on each side were (1.40 \xc2\xb1 .05) x 10\nW/m and (1.32 \xc2\xb1 .04)\n13\n2\nx 10\nW/m respectively (3.3 and 3.1 GPa peak pressure).

thus data to the right of this line are invalid.\n\nFor the\n\nunshocked specimens, there is a rapid drop-off in crack velocity with\nincreasing crack length.\nto Speidel and Hyatt\n\nThe initial stress of 16.5 MPav^m is, according\nclose to the "knee" between Region II (Kj-\n\nindependent) and Region I (Kj-dependent) of the V-K curve for 7075-T651.\nThus, a rapid drop-off in velocity with decreasing stress intensity\n(increasing crack length) would be expected.\n\nThe initial crack velocity\n\nQ\n\nof ^5 x 10\n\nm/sec are in reasonable agreement with Speidel and Hyatt\'s\n\nvalues.\nThe behavior of the shocked specimens of 7075-T651 is unexpected.\nAn explanation for the increasing crack velocity with decreasing stress\nintensity is not presently available; corrosion product wedging may be a\nfactor.\n\nCorrosion product wedging may also cause the sudden increase in\n\ncrack velocity with crack length in the (invalid) region beyond 1 mm for\nthe unshocked specimens.\nFigure 48 gives plots of crack velocity versus crack length for\nshocked and unshocked 2024-T351 alloy specimens.\n\nThese specimens were\n\ninitially stressed to a stress intensity of 22 MPav\'in, which according to\nSpeidel and Hyatt is well onto the "plateau" (Region II, Kj-independent)\nof the V-K curve.\n\nThus, a constant velocity with crack length would be\n\nexpected, and this was roughly observed.\n\nThere appears to be a significant\n\neffect of shocking on crack velocity, but unfortunately the velocity in\nthe shocked specimens is greater than in the unshocked specimens.\n\nUnfor-\n\ntunately the tests were terminated before the crack velocity in unshocked\nalloys started to decrease rapidly, so that no direct comparison of the\neffect of shocking on K-j-g^Q can be made.\n\n93\n\na.\n\nShocked\n\nb.\n\nUnshocked\n\nFIGURE 46.
