Those efforts included preliminary design system studies of commercial and military transports and experimental investigations leading to the development of the leading-edge flight test article installed on the NASA JetStar flight test aircraft. The benefits of LFC on drag, fuel efficiency, lift-to-drag ratio, and operating costs are compared with those for turbulent flow aircraft. The current activities in the NASA Industry Laminar-Flow Enabling Technologies Development contract include summaries of activities in the Task 1 development of a slotted-surface structural concept using advanced aluminum materials and the Task 2 preliminary conceptual design study of global-range military hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) to obtain data at high Reynolds numbers and at Mach numbers representative of long-range subsonic transport aircraft operation.", "title": "Lockheed laminar-flow control systems development and applications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:40:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900003190, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lange, Roy H."}, "organization": {"name": "Lockheed-Georgia Co.", "location": "Marietta, GA, United States"}}, "id": "dee87fcb44a74a0699704d25a15c8ac5"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900003190, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900003190, "id": "0e364f363d5a424c9f9ffdc1cd87b0dd", "publicationName": "NASA, Langley Research Center, Research in Natural Laminar Flow and Laminar-Flow Control, Part 1", "publicationDate": "1987-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900003190.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900003190/downloads/19900003190.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900003190/downloads/19900003190.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900003190/downloads/19900003190.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
