The research was motivated by the desire to formulate a means to use only flow parameters that can be sensed on the wall to describe the passing eddy structure. If a simple formulation can be obtained, it could conceivably be utilized to control actuators embedded in the wall. Such actuators have been developed by Jacobson and Reynolds (1993a), Blackwelder and Liu (1994), Tung et al. (1995), and others. These actuators have the common characteristics that they are small and are typically flush with the wall when not deployed. When they are activated, it is assumed that they will be able to interact constructively with the turbulent eddies near their location to either decrease the wall shear stress, enhance or reduce the mixing, etc. At present, there is only a nascent understanding of the interaction dynamics between the actuators and the eddies in the flow. Nevertheless, for such interaction to succeed, methods to couple the actuators to the oncoming flow must be obtained. General methods must be found that will detect the space and temporal location of the desired structure. In particular, it will be necessary to know when the eddies will arrive at the location of the actuator. This research attempted to use the shear stress measurements on the wall in the vicinity of an actuator location to predict when a particular eddy pattern would arrive and/or occur at the designated location. In this work the eddy pattern to be detected was identified by its velocity signature only.", "title": "A preliminary attempt to use neural networks for turbulent eddy classification", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:42:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960022312, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Blackwelder, Ron F."}, "organization": {"name": "Stanford Univ.", "location": "CA United States"}}, "id": "3fd4eba62edf4e8fbf0108dd8d97563f"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960022312, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960022312, "id": "0458aeda03594e1f98beb0f4776208d4", "publicationName": "Center for Turbulence Research Annual Research Briefs: 1995", "publicationDate": "1995-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19960022293, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Annual Research Briefs: 1995", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960022312.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960022312/downloads/19960022312.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960022312/downloads/19960022312.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960022312/downloads/19960022312.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
