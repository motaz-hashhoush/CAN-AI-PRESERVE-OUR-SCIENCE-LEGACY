Recently, the capabilities of this program have been extended and enhanced significantly. The revised program was installed at the NASA Ames manned flight-simulation facility to drive a computer-generated image of an enemy helicopter, thereby providing an adversary for the human pilot. Maneuvers are selected by employing game theory. Enhancements include a guidance law for target acquisition when a firing opportunity arises; fire-control sequence logic; improved low-flying capabilities; line-of-sight computations for the cockpit field-of-view, terrain obstructions, and visual range limits; use of terrain for masking; air-to-air collision-avoidance maneuvers; decision on dispensing flares and chaff; and adjustable levels of pilot experience. The program was found to be extremely useful for both rotorcraft handling-quality evaluations and air-to-air combat training.", "title": "Real-time simulation of helicopter air-to-air combat", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T13:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920031742, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Austin, Fred"}, "organization": {"name": "Grumman Aerospace Corp.", "location": "Bethpage, NY, United States"}}, "id": "ede988d4060b417d86a284919e5194af"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920031742, "meta": {"author": {"name": "George, Dino"}, "organization": {"name": "Grumman Corp.", "location": "Bethpage, NY, United States"}}, "id": "8a8f352f8b1c48b18c8ed05d2d4ed35f"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920031742, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bivens, Court"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center; U.S. Army, Aeroflightdynamics Directorate, Moffett Field", "location": "CA, United States"}}, "id": "9f7d8b3379aa4bb7a4d4a1c6e11d7ecd"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19920031742, "endDate": "1991-05-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "AHS Annual Forum", "location": "Phoenix, AZ", "id": "ffecc8e5f38741f986ae0f8f053106e9", "startDate": "1991-05-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19920031742, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920031742, "id": "984bf861910d4358b68c4a7e53122fe1", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
