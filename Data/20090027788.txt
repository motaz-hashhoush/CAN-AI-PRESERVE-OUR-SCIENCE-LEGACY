Heretofore, such devices\n(denoted, variously, as spin injectors,\nspin polarizers, and spin filters) have\ntypically offered polarization ratios having magnitudes in the approximate\nrange of 0.01 to 0.1. The proposed devices could be useful as efficient sources\nof spin-polarized electron currents for\nresearch on spintronics and development of practical spintronic devices.\nThe polarization ratio in question \xe2\x80\x94\ndenoted the current spin polarization \xe2\x80\x94\nis a standard measure of efficiency of a\nspin-polarizing device. It is defined in\nterms of current densities along a given\ncoordinate axis, by means of the following equation:\nPJ = (J\xe2\x86\x91 \xe2\x80\x93 J\xe2\x86\x93)/(J\xe2\x86\x91 + J\xe2\x86\x93),\nwhere J\xe2\x86\x91 is current density of electrons\nin the \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d spin state and J\xe2\x86\x93 is the current density of electrons in the \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d\nspin state. If J\xe2\x86\x91 and J\xe2\x86\x93 can be made to\nhave opposite signs \xe2\x80\x94 in other words, if\nelectrons in opposite spin states can be\nmade to move in opposite directions \xe2\x80\x94\nthen, as desired, it is possible to obtain\n|PJ|>1. By making |PJ|>1, one would make\nit possible to obtain a net spin flux with\nlittle net electric current.\nA spin-polarizing device according to\nthe proposal would be based largely on\nthe same principles as those of the devices described in \xe2\x80\x9cElectron-Spin Filters\nBased on the Rashba Effect\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO30635), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 28, No. 10\n(October 2004), page 58. To recapitulate: The Rashba effect is an energy splitting, of what would otherwise be degenerate quantum states, caused by a\nspin-orbit interaction in conjunction\nwith interfacial electric fields in an asymmetrical semiconductor heterostructure.

Theoretically, electron-energy\nstates would be split by the Rashba effect, and spin-polarized currents would\nbe extracted by resonant quantum-mechanical tunneling. Accordingly, a spinpolarizing device based on these principles would be denoted an asymmetric\nresonant interband (or intraband, as the\ncase may be) tunneling diode [a-RITD].\nOne possible structure of a device according to the present proposal would\nbe similar to the a-RITD structure described previously: The device would\ncomprise an asymmetric composite\nInAs-GaSb well, sandwiched between\nAlSb barriers and degenerately-ndoped InAs emitter and collector electrodes (see figure). Unpolarized electrons from the conduction band of the\nInAs emitter electrode would tunnel\nthrough one AlSb barrier and travel\n\nthrough an asymmetric InAs-GaSb\nquantum well, where Rashba spin splitting would occur; they would then tunnel through the other AlSb barrier into\nthe conduction band of the InAs collector electrode. The device would be\noperated in an intraband-tunneling\nregime, in which no bias would be applied through the thickness of the\nstack of layers. A lateral electric (an\nelectric field parallel to the planes of\nthe layers) would be applied to emitter\nlayer. With appropriately chosen thicknesses of layers and an appropriate\nvalue of the applied lateral electric\nfield, it should be possible to achieve\n|PJ|>1.\nThis work was done by David Z.
