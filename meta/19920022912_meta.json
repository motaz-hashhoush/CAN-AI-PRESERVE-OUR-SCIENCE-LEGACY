The geometry of Cr(CO)5 is partially optimized at the MCPF, CCSD and CCSD(T) levels of theory. Comparison with experimental data shows that the CCSD(T) method gives the best results for the structures and force constants, and that remaining errors are probably due to deficiencies in the one-particle basis sets used for CO. A detailed comparison of the properties of free CO is therefore given, at both the MCPF and CCSD/CCSD(T) levels of treatment, using a variety of basis sets. With very large one-particle basis sets, the SSCD(T) method gives excellent results for the bond distance, dipole moment and harmonic frequency of free CO. The total binding energies of Cr(CO)6 and Cr(CO)5 are also determined at the MCPF, CCSD and CCSD(T) levels of theory. The CCSD(T) method gives a much larger total binding energy than either the MCPF or CCSD methods. An analysis of the basis set superposition error (BSSE) at the MCPF level of treatment points out limitations in the one-particle basis used here and in a previous study. Calculations using larger basis sets reduced the BSSE, but the total binding energy of Cr(CO)6 is still significantly smaller than the experimental value, although the first CO bond dissociation energy of Cr(CO)6 is well described. An investigation of 3s3p correlation reveals only a small effect. The remaining discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical total binding energy of Cr(CO)6 is probably due to limitations in the one-particle basis, rather than limitations in the correlation treatment. In particular an additional d function and an f function on each C and O are needed to obtain quantitative results. This is underscored by the fact that even using a very large primitive se (1042 primitive functions contracted to 300 basis functions), the superposition error for the total binding energy of Cr(CO)6 is 22 kcal/mol at the MCPF level of treatment.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920022912, "id": "b23a2f5718a94ab9bb7e830aaddd7101", "publicationDate": "1992-08-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920022912.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920022912/downloads/19920022912.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920022912/downloads/19920022912.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920022912/downloads/19920022912.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
