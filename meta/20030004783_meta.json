Originating from NASA's space shuttle thermal protection system, one such material is Chartek 59 fireproofing, an intumescent epoxy coating specifically designed for outdoor use by industrial facilities dealing with highly flammable products such as oil refineries and chemical plants. The coating is applied usually by spray gun to exterior structural steel conduits, pipes and valves, offshore platforms and liquefied petroleum gas tanks. Fireproofing provides two types of protection: ablation or dissipation of heat by burn-off and \"intumescence\" or swelling; the coating swells to about five times its original size, forming a protective blanket of char which retards transfer of heat to the metal structure preventing loss of structural strength and possible collapse which would compound the fire fighting problem.", "title": "Fire Protection Materials", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030004783, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030004783, "id": "67ecaf3064964fb589e4bfac1071126a", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1980", "publicationDate": "1980-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030004783.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030004783/downloads/20030004783.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030004783/downloads/20030004783.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030004783/downloads/20030004783.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
