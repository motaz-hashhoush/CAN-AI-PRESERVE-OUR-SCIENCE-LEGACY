Architecture\n1/2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRadiation\n\xe2\x80\x93 Limited experience beyond low Earth Orbit\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHi-res cameras on ISS have been highly susceptible to ionizing radiation damage to sensors\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCMOS less susceptible than CCD\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSome cameras can have 7-10 pixels damaged per day\nSome sensors self anneal\nIn-camera pixel correction has been successful\n\nJapanese Space Agency had an HD camera on a Moon probe (Selene) that did not suffer as much\ndamage as expected\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Can also cause latch-ups or damage recorded data\n\xe2\x80\x93 Can cause damage/colorization to coatings on glass\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVacuum\n\xe2\x80\x93 Heat dissipation is a problem since fans are not practical\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOne workaround is to put cameras in a sealed container filled with nitrogen at 1 atmospheric pressure\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Anything with exposed moving parts must work in a vacuum!\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTemperature fluctuations\n\xe2\x80\x93 Exposed hardware is subject to rapid heating or cooling\n\xe2\x80\x93 Known to cause leakage in exposed lens housings\n\xe2\x80\x93 Can cause moving parts to seize\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nChallenges for Imagery Architecture\n2/2\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Bandwidth constraints\n\xe2\x80\x93 Conventional RF transmission takes power and large antennas\n\xe2\x80\x93 Optical offers far more bandwidth in bursts but has problems\nwith availability, aiming of antennas\n\xe2\x80\x93 Video requires orders of magnitude more bandwidth than all\nother communications\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Link integrity\n\xe2\x80\x93 Conventional two-way IP connections are not practical due to\nbreaks in links and latency between nodes\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Command & Control\n\xe2\x80\x93 Ground commanding of remote cameras, encoders and related\nsystems typically requires two-way communications\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Latency can be an issue for pin-point aiming, focus, etc.\n\n7\n\n8\n\nMitigations, Ideas & Unknowns\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStill a lot of debate about \xe2\x80\x9cradiation hardened\xe2\x80\x9d camera

missions\n\nDetachable/Throw-away camera systems for third-person views, inspections, emergency scenarios\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAllows pan/tilt function\nHow to get live video off a system with small sized unit?\nAutonomous/Smart technology to be self-aware?\nBuffer video?\n\nNeed smart systems that can re-boot themselves if latch-ups occur\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEfforts have been expensive with \xe2\x80\x9chit-or-miss\xe2\x80\x9d results\nCommercial Panasonic 3DA1 is by far the best performing camera flown to date--nobody knows why\nJAXA\xe2\x80\x99s Selene camera performed very well, maybe because it was shielded by fuel tanks\n\nHEVC currently requires significant CPU/GPU, large footprint hardware with high power consumption\nVariable frame rate?\nAutomated scene dependent encoder for efficiency?\n\nAutomated/smart technologies to be self-aware, adjust to environment\nThe International Space Station is an excellent laboratory for testing technologies\nThe ideal system weighs nothing, generates no heat, and takes up no volume\xe2\x80\xa6.\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nLight, small footprint, and low power are key\n\n9\n\nOne more

sharing our experiences with the\nAmerican public (and the world)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Space Act that created NASA requires the Agency to share its\nactivities with the public, because the public paid for it\n\xe2\x80\x93 What if the tax-payer didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for all of it?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Unique partnerships are possible\n\xe2\x80\x93 IMAX films\n\xe2\x80\x93 Time\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of Commander Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cYear in Space\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Maybe we could do something that isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite NASCAR-like, more\nlike PBS, where commercial enterprises

Space - Goals\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifty years after the creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a\ndestination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn\nand operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time,\nultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite. And in\nfulfilling this task, we will not only extend humanity\xe2\x80\x99s reach in space -- we\nwill strengthen America\xe2\x80\x99s leadership here on Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n- President Obama - April, 2010\n\n12\n\nOur Purpose\nExpand human presence into the\nsolar system and to the surface of\nMars to advance exploration, science,\ninnovation, benefits to humanity, and\ninternational collaboration.\n\nEvery decision made is made with this purpose in mind.\nIt requires sustainable exploration.\nTo us, that means affordable and continuous.\n13\n\n'
