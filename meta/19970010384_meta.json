In particular, we discuss a new iterative approach for describing the dynamics of an isolated astronomical N-body system in metric theories of gravity. To do this, we generalize the Fock-Chandrasekhar method of the weak-field and slow-motion approximation (WFSMA) and develop a theory of relativistic reference frames (RF's) for a gravitationally bounded many-extended-body problem. In any proper RF constructed in the immediate vicinity of an arbitrary body, the N-body solutions of the gravitational field equations are formally presented as a sum of the Riemann-flat inertial space-time, the gravitational field generated by the body itself, the unperturbed solutions for each body in the system transformed to the coordinates of this proper RF, and the gravitational interaction term. We develop the basic concept of a general WFSMA theory of the celestial RF's applicable to a wide class of metric theories of gravity and an arbitrary model of matter distribution. We apply the proposed method to general relativity. Celestial bodies are described using a perfect fluid model; as such, they possess any number of internal mass and current multipole moments that explicitly characterize their internal structures. The obtained relativistic corrections to the geodetic equations of motion arise because of a coupling of the bodies' multiple moments to the surrounding gravitational field. The resulting relativistic transformations between the different RF's extend the Poincare group to the motion of deformable self-gravitating bodies. Within the present accuracy of astronomical measurements we discuss the properties of the Fermi-normal-like proper RF that is defined in the immediate vicinity of the extended compact bodies. We further generalize the proposed approximation method and include two Eddington parameters (gamma, Beta). This generalized approach was used to derive the relativistic equations of satellite motion in the vicinity of the extended bodies. Anticipating improvements in radio and laser tracking technologies over the next few decades, we apply this method to spacecraft orbit determination. We emphasize the number of feasible relativistic gravity tests that may be performed within the context of the parameterized WFSMA. Based on the planeto-centric equations of motion of a spacecraft around the planet, we suggested a new null test of the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP). The experiment to measure the corresponding SEP violation effect could be performed with the future Mercury Orbiter mission. We discuss other relativistic effects, including the perihelion advance and the redshift and geodetic precession of the orbiter's orbital plane about Mercury, as well as the possible future implementation of the proposed formalism in software codes developed for solar-system orbit determination.
