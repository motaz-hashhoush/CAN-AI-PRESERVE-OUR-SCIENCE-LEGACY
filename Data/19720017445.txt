b'When the Beachhopper Looks at the Moon:\nThe Moon-Compass Hypothesis\nJAMES T. ENRIGHT\nScripps Institution of Oceanography\n\nT\n\nFRISCH KRAAND\nthat honey bees and starlings are\nable to use the position of the Sun to orient\nin a fixed compass direction seemed highly\nimprobable when initially described. Subsequent research, however, has borne out these\nclaims and demonstrated that many other animals, both vertebrate and invertebrate, have\nthe same capacity. Sun-compass orientation\nnow represents one of the most secure foundation blocks underlying the hypotheses proposed to account for otherwise unexplainable\ncases of animal orientation and navigation.\nShortly after this remarkable discovery,\ntwo Italian workers, Pardi and Papi, published substantia1 evidence indicating that\ncrustacean sandhoppers, amphipods of the\ngenus Talitrus, are also able to use Sun-compass orientation, with a directional preference\nthat would be seaward on the beach from\nwhich the animals were collected (ref. 1) ;\nand advanced the claim, on less extensive\nevidence, that these amphipods can also use\nthe position of the Moon in order to orient\ntoward the shoreline, in a manner similar to\ntheir performance with the Sun (ref. 2).\nMoon-compass orientation of this sort would\nbe a phenomenon even more remarkable\nHE DISCOVERY BY VON\n\nMER\n\nthan Sun-compass orientation, because of the\ncomplex pattern from hour to hour and day\nto day in the direction of the Moon. It is\nsurprising, then, that so little subsequent research on Moon-orientation has been undertaken to verify or disprove this claim.\nA possible explanation for this lack of interest may be that the Moon-compass hypothesis is an intrinsically unattractive propostion.\nAs applied to talitrids, the hypothesis requires\nthe assumption that the amphipods have two\nseparate and independent timing mechanisms: a Sun-clock, synchronized by the daynight cycle, which the animal consults when\norienting by the Sun; and a Moon-clock,\nwhich operates at a slightly slower rate,\nwhich is synchronized by other environmental\nstimuli, and which the animal consults when\norienting by the Moon. The amphipod\nwould, then, not behave as a temporal unit,\nwith internal synchronization of various functions, but instead must be assumed to have\ntwo time-measuring systems, much as a railroad conductor niight have two separate\nwatches, one in each pocket, to use when\ncrossing to different time zones. For me, then,\nthe Moon-compass hypothesis is esthetically\nunappealing.\n\n523\n\n524\n\nANIMAL O R I E N T A T I O N AND NAVIGATION\n\nNevertheless, I will be presenting extensive evidence that seems to favor the Mooncompass hypothesis. But let me reemphasize\nat the outset that this is not because I like the\nhypothesis. The reason for this anomalous\nposition in which I find myself is that there\nnow exists an appreciable body of data on\nnocturnal orientation of talitrids, data that\nrequire explanation. Although the Mooncompass hypothesis is an esthetically unattractive way of explaining these data, it\nseems to me to be the best of the alternatives\npresently available.\nThe evidence bearing on the Moon-compass hypothesis that I propose to review consists of the data from five published papers\n(ref. 2, hereafter designated as San Rossore I\nexperiments; ref. 3 : San Rossore I1 experiments; ref. 4: La Jolla experiments; ref. 5:\nCastiglione experiments; and table 1 of ref.\n6: Mogadiscio experiments);a manuscript by\nPeter Craig (Univ. of California, Santa\nBarbara): which he has very kindly sent to\nme before publication (Santa Barbara experiments); and the data from two extensive\nstudies of my own that have not previously\nbeen published (Naples and Malibu experiments). These latter data are summarized in\ndetail in appendixes A and B and constitute\na larger number of experiments than the\ntotal contained in all the published literature.\nI will draw upon all of these data in an\nattempt to answer a series of questicns of\nincreasing complexity about the nocturnal\nbehavior of talitrids.\n\nMethods and Materials\nThe procedure used in studies of Moon\norientation has consisted of collecting groups\nof amphipods from the beach, usually during\nthe daylight hours, at which time they are\nburied at depths of 2 to 20 cm into the sand;\nstoring them in light-tight containers until\n\nthe start of observation (exceptions in ref.\n42) placing them into a circular, sealed ob;\nservation chamber, in which a view of terrestrial landmarks is prevented; and recording their positions-the directions of orientation-as they aggregate around the margin of\nthe container.\nAbout 25 animals have been used per experiment. In all published experiments, the\nanimals have been stored in bottles containing sand; removal of the animals from the\nsand for transfer to the orientation chamber\nrequires several minutes of exposure to moonlight. In the Naples and Malibu experiments\n(appendixes 1 and 2), I kept the animals\nbefore observation in sealed containers in\nwhich there was only a strip of paper towel,\nmoistened with seawater; this permits transfer to the orientation chamber within a matter\nof seconds after removal from darkness.\nCraig and I have photographed the animal positions with the camera above the observation chamber, through a glass cover;\nPapi, Pardi, and Ercolini have photographed\nthe animals from beneath, or, in one study\n(some of the Mogadiscio experiments) made\nvisual counts of position. In most cases, the\norientation chamber has been heated to\nabout 20" C, and in some cases, also dehydrated ; the possible influence of these experimental conditions is discussed in detail in\nquestion VI1 below.\nThe other data in ref. 6 are derived from performances when the Moon was passing through the\nzenith or culminating in the north. The orientations\nobserved were usually widely scattered, with only\neight results statistically significant. The orientations also deviated by large amounts from the expected direction, a fact which the authors attribute\nto peculiarities in lunar path on the equator during\nthe equinox. For this reason data in tables 2 and 3\nof ref. 6 may not represent a valid test of the\nMoon-compass hypothesis.\n\'CRAIG, P. C.: An Analysis of the Concept of\nLunar Orientation in Orchestoidea corniculata\n( Amphipoda) . In press, Animal Behavior, 1971.\n\nSESSION\n\nV: SENSORY MECHANISMS-OTHER\n\nAll of my experiments have been conducted in locations far from the possible influence of urban illumination. Apparently\nonly the Mogadiscio experiments were conducted within a large city, and the experimenters, in that case, have described the precautions they took to reduce the influence of\nurban lighting to a diffuse glow (ref. 6, p.\n\n229).\nThe direction of orientation of the animals within an experiment has been averaged\nby a vectorial method (ref. 1, p. 463) that is\nnow widely used in orientation studies. In\naddition to its direction, this vector has a\nlength that can range from zero to one and\nmeasures the internal agreement in the experimental observations, with a short vector\nindicating a wide scatter in the positions of\nthe animals.\nThe experimental organisms have included three species of talitrid amphipods:\nTaEitrus saltator (San Rossore, Castiglione\nand Naples experiments), Orchestoidea corniculata (La Jolla, Malibu and Santa Barbara experiments), and Talorchestia martensii (Mogadiscio experiments). Although\nthese are members of different genera, their\niriorphology and choice of habitat would lead\nthe non-specialist to regard them as very\nclosely related and ecologically equivalent. In\nmy opinion, none of the differences between\nthe data sets to be evaluated can unequivocally be traced to a difference between species; greater differences in nocturnal orientation have been recorded within a species than\nbetween species.\n\nSURVEY OF DATA\nQuestion I\nDo the amphipods usually show significant, non-random choices of direction at\nnight when deprived of all obvious orientstional clues except the Moon and stars?\n\n525\n\nA rigorous evaluation of non-randomness\nin the data from Moon-orientation experiments is a complex statistical problem because all observations have been made with\ngroups of 10 to 40 animals placed simultaneously in a relatively small container. The amphipods often push and crawl over each\nother, so that their choices of position cannot\nlegitimately be regarded as independent. All\nstatistical tests for the significance of orientation, however, assume a series of independect\nobservations. This disparity between experimental methods and statistical requirements\nmeans that the probability levels which can\nbe derived from a statistical test cannot be\nregarded as completely legitimate ; the probability that a given distribution could arise by\nchance alone may well be underestimated.\nIn addition, one must be particularly\ncareful about the degrees of freedom applicable to the statistical test, since several of the\npubIished sets of data (San Rossore 1 , Cas1\ntiglione, Mogadiscio) are derived from repetitive photographs of the same group of animals. A proper, conservative approach requires that the nonrandomness of a particular distribution of directions of orientation be\nassessed on the basis of the numbers of animals observed and not on the numbers of\npositions recorded. I have excluded all directions of orientation by talitrids from further\ndata analyses in which a statistical test on the\nbasis of the number of animals used indicates\nthat the orientation was not significantly nonrandom at the 5-percent level3 or better.\n(See appendix 3 for a list of published data\nwhich have been so excluded.) This precautions seems essential to assure that the data\non observed directions of orientation are not\n\n\xe2\x80\x99Statistical significance has been evaluated by\nmeans of figure 15 of Schmidt-Koenig (ref. 7 ) .\nBecause of the interactions between animals the\nquoted levels of significance must be regarded as\ndoubtful.\n\n526\n\nANIMAL O R I E N T A T I O N AND NAVIGATION\n\nbadly distorted by chance factors, or perhaps\ndue only to chance. I have also used only\nthose data from the Mogadiscio experiments\nwhich were based on photographs, except\nwhen the photographic observation was not\nstatistically significant, in which case I used\nthe data from the succeeding visual count\n(See appendix 4). This restriction of the\nusable data is not primarily because of any\ndoubts about the reliability of visual counting\nof moving animals, but because internal evidence in the data implies that the visual\ncounts were usually made on the same group\nof amphipods that had just previously been\nphotographed. In that case, the visual counts\nwould not represent independent data in a\nrigorous sense but only the equivalent of additional photographs of the same animals.\nEven after making allowances for all\nthese complications, however, there are sufficient data now available to indicate that talitrid amphipods do, indeed, very often show\nconspicuous nonrandomness in their orientation at night when they can see the Moon.\nTable 1 contains a summary of the proportion of experiments in which the observed\norientation was strong enough to be considered significant (with reservations; see footnote 3 ) at the 0.01 level. In several of the\nexperimental series additional cases involved strong suggestions of orientation\n(0.01<p3 <0.05), so that the available data\nto assess the directions of orientation are\nsomewhat greater than the numbers of cases\nindicated as positive in this table. The internal consistency of the directions chosen by\nseparate groups of animals, when significant\norientation was observed within an experimental series (discussed\' below) ,lends further\nemphasis to the conclusion that nonrandom\norientation is involved.\nAn appreciable number of experiments\nhave been performed, however, in which the\nobserved animal positions are not distinguish-\n\nTABLE\n1.-Cases of Non-Random Orientation\nxcentage of\nbxperiments\nshowing\nNumber of\nstrong\n:xperiments\nrientation\n(P<.Ol) a\n\nExperimental series\n\n.\n\nSan Rossore I . . . . . . .\nSan Rossore I1\nFreshly collected. . . .\nKept 11 to 20 days..\nLa Jolla\nFreshly collected. , .\nKept 1 or 2 weeks.. .\nCastiglione\nFreshly collected. . . .\nMogadiscio\nFreshly collectcd. . .\nSanta Barbara\nFreshly collected. . . ,\nNaples\nFreshly collected. . . .\nKept 3 to 10 days. . .\nMalibu\nFreshly collected. . . .\nKept 2 to 5 days.. . .\n\n.\n\n.\n\n8\n\n16\n\nNo data on\nscatter\n\n17\n17\n\n100\n65\n\n37\n15\n\n89\n47\n\n11\n\n100\n\n34\n\n59\n\n59\n\n29\n\n25\n42\n\n68\n57\n\n44\n36\n\n82\n72\n\nSee footnote 3 in text.\n\nabie from a random distribution even at the\n5-percent level of significance: cases in which\nthe animals scattered in all directions. As suggested by the breakdowns in table 1, animals\nkept in the laboratory for longer periods of\ntime apparently show random scatter in their\ndirections more often than freshly collected\nanimals; and, as will be considered subsequently, clearer evidence for orientation is\noften obtained at full Moon than at other\ntimes. Nevertheless, there remain many cases\n-particularly in the data of Craig, but also\nin other experimental series-in which a scatter not distinguishable from a random choice\nof directions has been observed and for which\nno adequate explanation seems available. In\n\nSESSION\n\n527\n\nV : SENSORY MECHANISMS-OTHER\n\nmy opinion, the best reply to the question\nposed in this section is that talitrid amphipods are very often able to orient significantly\nwhen they see the Moon, but that they sometimes do not, for unknown reasons.\n\nQuestion 11\n\nIs the Moon the primary orienting stimulus in these experiments, when clear orientation is observed?\nThe principal evidence available for the\nconclusion that the amphipods use the Moon\nfor orientation consists of data from mirror\nexperiments: the animals are permitted to\nview the Moon while they orient; then the\nview of the Moon is obstructed by a screen,\nand its image is reflected onto the orientation\nchamber by means of a mirror from some\nnew direction. Relatively few mirror experiments have been performed, and the results\nof these tests are not entirely\xe2\x80\x99satisfying.\nIf the Moon is the sole orienting stimulus,\none could well expect that the animals would\norient toward the mirror with an angle corresponding to that which they assume relative\nto the real Moon. This has been recorded in\nsome experiments but less convincingly so in\nothers.\nThe best performance of amphipods in a\nseries of mirror experiments is found in my\ndata for Talitrus saltator from Naples (fig.\n1A). In these experiments, the mirror sometimes reflected the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s image from an altitude of about 30\xe2\x80\x99 and in other cases, an\naltitude of about 60\xe2\x80\x9d. Apparently only lunar\nazimuth affected orientation. Another clearly\npositive result was obtained in a single experiment with Orchestoidea corniculata in my\nLa Jolla experiments (fig. 1B).\nPapi and Pardi\xe2\x80\x99s results (ref. 2) with Talitrus saltator showed a wide scatter (fig. 2A\nand B), but it is uncertain to what extent\nthese particular results should be a cause for\n\nconcern, since no data were given on the\nnumber of animals used or the degree of scatter within the observations. My results from\nmirror experiments in the Malibu experimental series also showed large departures from\nexpectations (fig. 2C and D) There was, in\nthese latter experiments, also, a strong trend\nfor the amphipods\xe2\x80\x99 orientations toward reflected moonlight to be more dispersed than\ntheir orientations toward the Moon itself. All\nobservations included in figure 2C and D are\nstatistically significant ( p<.O1; see footnote\n3), but the vector length within the mirror\nexperiments was smaller (;.e., the scatter was\ngreater) than in the preceding control experiment with the Moon itself in 19 cases out of\n24.\nA single experiment of another sort per-\n\n.\n\nDIRECTION\n\nIN1 AL\n\nlRECTIO\n\nA\n\nB\n\nFIGURE 1. \xe2\x80\x9cSuccessful\xe2\x80\x9d mirror experiments: (A)\nData from Naples experiments, April 3, April 8,\nand April 13, 1963; direction of orientation initially assumed by the animals has been used\nfor standardization (downward); image of M o\non\nwas reflected from a direction opposite the\nactual lunar azimuth.

Following initial\norientation with a view of the Moon, and\nseveral relatively successful mirror experiments, the animals were left undisturbed in\nthe orientation chamber for 10 minutes, during which time a direct view of the Moon\nwas obstructed, and then their distribution\n\nwas recorded, still with the Moon hidden. As\nis evident in table 2, the amphipods which\ncould not see the Moon or its reflection\nshowed strong orientation in a direction not\ngreatly different from that observed when\nthey could see the Moon.\nThis result was initially very disconcerting; it leads to serious questions about\nwhether moonlight is, indeed, the factor responsible for the orientation. It brought to\n\nSESSION\n\nV: SENSORY MECHANISMS-OTHER\n\nthe edges of the screen; and a point source of\nlight, largely without skyglow, from the mirror.\nMy own qualitative observations, as well\nas those of others (ref. 2) mggest that talitrid amphipods are usually disoriented on\nmoonless nights; but as shown in table 1, lack\nof orientation can also occur, for unknown\nreasons, on nights when the Moon is visible.\nTherefore, disorientation on moonless nights\n-unless it is observed in a very large number\nof cases-is weak evidence, at best, for the\ninvolvement of the Moon in the orientation.\nI t has, in fact, recently been claimed that\nTalitrus saltator can orient significantly both\nduring the daytime and at night, without\nseeing either the Sun or Moon (ref. 8). The\nimplication of that article is that some unspecified geophysicaldirectional cue, of a category not usually recognized as being biologically effective, was involved. Magnetism was\napparently excluded.\nI t is my opinion that these claims are, at\npresent, insufficiently substantiated to warrant serious concern about the results obtained in Moon-orientation experiments. The\npublished description of experimental methods is extremely brief; it is, therefore, not\nclear that some accidental aspect of the ex-\n\nmy attention, however, the following fact:\nobstructing a direct view of the Moon by\nmeans of an opaque screen 1 m wide located\n2 to 3 m from the observation chamber does\nnot provide the animals with a stimulus-free\nvisual environmeht, any more than it would\nduring the daytime. In addition to the form\nof the Moon itself, mbonlight includes the\nillumination of a broad region of the sky, and\nit was very easy to determine the brightest\nregion of the sky, and thereby, the direction\nof the Moon, under the conditions of the experiment shown in the last part of table 2.\nI t seems possible, therefore, that the orientation of talitrid amphipods to moonlight\ndoes not require a point source of light but\ncan be based on the brightest general region\nof the total field of illumination. Such an\nability might be particularly useful to these\nanimals during night-time orientation on\nbeaches where clouds and fog often partially\nobscure the position of the Moon.\nIf this interpretation is correct, then the\ninconsistent directions often noted during\nmirror experiments (fig. 2), as well as the\nshorter vector lengths, would be expected. A\nmirror experiment would involve exposing\nthe animals to two possible orienting stimuli:\nskyglow from the real Moon, visible around\n\nTABLE\n2.-Data\n\n529\n\nof\n\nOctober 17, I964\n\nTime\n\nLunar azimuth\n\nVector length\n\n22:59\n23:04\n23:06\n23:07\n23:18\n23:20\n\n211"\n213"\na 3O\n3\n33"\n(216")\n(217")\n\n0.64\n0.74\n0.89\n0.93\n0.79\n0.68\n\nOrientation azimuth\n156"\n167"\n296"\n296"\n171\'\n188"\n\nAngle with Moon\n-55\n-46\n-79\n-79\n-45\n-29\n\n530\n\nANIMAL O R I E N T A T I O N AND NAVIGATION\n\nperimental arrangement--e.g. cloud pattern,\nor the light source used for photography, or\nthe slope of the observation chamber (ref. 9)\nor wind direction (ref. 2 ) 4 i d not sometimes provide directional stimuli. Beyond this,\nthe statistical test used to assess the results is\nclearly inappropriate : multiple photographs\nof the animal positions were used to increase\nunjustifiably the statistical degrees of freedom, and no allowance was made for possible\ninteraction between animals. Since the reported orientations were much more dispersed than those usually found when the\nanimals see either the Sun or the Moon, concern about subtle artifacts in the experimental situation, as well as about appropriateness\nof statistical methods, are of extreme importance in evaluating a study of this sort.\nWhile the claim of Van der Bercken et al.\nremains, in my view, unproven, the lack of\ncomplete success in the mirror experiments\nshown in figure 2 also leaves open the possibility of unknown influences in talitrid orientation. The Moon is clearly implicated as\nan important orienting stimulus by the fact\nthat reflection of the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s image from a\nmirror produces large deviations from the\nprior orientation direction, deviations which\nusually are much greater than would be expected due to chance alone. Nevertheless, it\nremains possible that some other factor, such\nas the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field, also jointly affects the net directions of orientation.\nOne form of this alternative hypothesis\nwhich I have considered and rejected is that\nthe initial orientation is due primarily to\nmagnetism (or a similar clue) ; that the animals thereafter note the direction of the\nMoon, and subsequently use the Moon as a\nreference stimulus. This admittedly rather\ncomplex hypothesis might account for the observed inconsistencies in the mirror experiments ; the hypothesis predicts, however, that\nif the amphipods, on their first exposure in\n\nthe orientation chamber, see the Moon reflected from a mirror, their orientation\nshould be in the same compass direction as\nthat of animals which initially see the unreflected Moon. Subsequent exposure to the\nreal Moon should then lead these experimental animals to orientation in the opposite\ndirection. An experiment which contradicts\nthis prediction is summarized in figure 3.\nThe net weight of the evidence, in my\nopinion, supports the assumption that moonlight is the primary and probably only significant orienting stimulus in the experiments\nwhich have been performed on Moon orientation. This is, however, probably the weakest\nlink in the chain of evidence leading to the\nMoon-compass hypothesis. Should convincing\nevidence become available that talitrids orient consistently in a constant compass direction by means of some subtle non-visual stim-\n\nCONTROLS\nSUBSEQUENT\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\x9d CORRECT \xe2\x80\x9c\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCORRECT \xe2\x80\x9d\nDIRECTION\n\n(1939\n\n(193\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nDIRECTION\n\nFIGURE\n\n8.

Only in my Naples\nexperiments (fig. 5 C ) and, to a lesser extent,\nmy La Jolla experiments (fig. 5B), were an\nappreciable number of the observations in an\necologically \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d direction. Craig\xe2\x80\x99s observations, for which individual data are not\nyet available, also involved an apparently\n\n531\n\nfaulty choice of directions. He studied animals from three beaches, which faced NNW,\nSE and SSE, and concluded that when significant orientation occurred (which was seldom-see table l ) , \xe2\x80\x9cthe amphipods generally\noriented in the northeast sector, a direction\nof puzzling ecological significance.\xe2\x80\x9d Since no\nbreakdown of these observations by beachof-origin was given, it is conceivable that a\nmajor fraction of the observed statistically\nsignificant orientations in this study were also\nwithin, say, 60 O of the appropriate direction.\nWithin the framework of this question\nabout ecological significance, it seems appropriate to consider briefly whether the usefulness of Moon orientation for the animals\nunder field conditions represents an adequate\nexplanation for its evolutionary origin. I t is,\nof course, true that the Moon would be above\nthe horizon at night no more than half of the\nmonth; and that, in coastal areas, nighttime\nclouds and fog are often common and intense\nenough that the animals would be unable to\nperceive or determine the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s direction\neven when it is above the horizon. One must\npresume, then, that orientation by the Moon\nis only a supplementary mechanism for direction finding by talitrids on the beach at\nnight, and indeed, other mechanisms have\nbeen documented, including orientation to\nwind direction (ref. 2 ) , and visual orientation to conspicuous topographic features (ref.\n\nIO).\nGranted that the amphipods may seldom\nin nature have both the need and the opportunity to use the Moon as a basis for orientation, it nonetheless seems plausible that, at\nleast occasionally, for some individuals in the\npopulation, the capacity may have a major\ninfluence on survival. The persistence,\nthrough evolution, of a given behavioral pattern does not require that the behavior regularly be used by all members of the population, nor even that the behavior be used oc-\n\nANIMAL\n\n532\n\nO R I E N T A T I O N AND NAVIGATION\n\n100%\nWITHIN f60\xc2\xb0\n\nA\n\n0 EXPECTED=270e\n\nB\n\n0 EXPECTED-201\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEXPECTED\n\n100%WITHIN f60\xc2\xb0\n\n95% WITHIN f60\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n100%WITHIN f75\xe2\x80\x99\n\nC\n\nD\n\n0 P> .01\n0.

Except in the tropics,\nthe amphipods could, in principle, orient to\nwithin about 90\xc2\xb0 of the ecologically correct\ndirection, by means of a non-compensatory,\nfixed angle of orientation to the Moon, provided that the fixed angle chosen were correlated with the orientation of the hoine beach.\nThe results shown in figures 4 and 5 could\n\n534\n\nANIMAL\n\nORIENTATION AND NAVIGATION\n\nconceivably all be due to such a non-mmpensatory orientation.\nContrary to my previous interpretation\n(ref. 4), it is now my opinion that the question of time-compensation in talitrid orientation must be answered with a qualified affirmative. The qualifications are the following: one must accept the assumption that\nthe Moon is the only orientational stimulus\nleading to the performance (See Question 1 ,\n1\nabove.) ;and one must grant that, for reasons\nas yet undetermined, the animals sometimes\nfail to show their full orientational capacity.\nTalitrids are sometimes able to compensate in\ntheir orientation for changes in the direction\nof the Moon, but they do not always do so.\nConsideration will be given in a later section to the various factors, including duration\nof captivity and lunar phase, which do or\nmay influence the performance of talitrids in\ntheir Moon orientation\'. Initially, however, let\nus ignore such factors and look at the overall\nresults to see whether the amphipods show\norientation which varies with position of the\nMoon. The data are summarized in graphical\nform in figures 6 and 7. The experiments\ncovered in Figure 6A should be regarded\nwith caution, since it is uncertain which of\nthe results are, as single experiments, statistically significant. In all other cases, the results\nincluded in the graphs involved orientation\nwhich was statistically significant at the 0.01\nlevel (solid circles), or the 0.05 level (open\ncircles; see footnote 3).\nIn nearly all experimental series, there are\nmajor deviations of the observations from expectations, as is implied, also, in figures 4 and\n5. Nevertheless, there is, in each experimental\nseries, a trend toward a smaller angle of orientation as the Moon moves from east\nthrough south to west (Le. lunar azimuth increases). In the results shown in figure 6, the\nslopes of the regression lines are not significantly different from the expected value of\n\n-1.0.\n\nIn the experimental series included in\nfigure 7, the slopes of the calculated regression lines are significantly different from zero,\nindicating some compensation; but the slopes\nare also significantly different from -1.0, indicating that compensation was not always as\ncomplete as expected.\nAn overall view of the data thus demonstrates that the orientation of talitrids to the\nMoon is not a fixed-angle orientation, but\ninvolves time-compensation, which seems in\nsome cases quite complete (figure 6), and in\nother cases (figure 7 ) only partial: qualitatively correct but quantitatively insufficient.\nEven in my Naples experiments, in which the\ndirections of orientation were poorest in\nterms of beach-of-origin (fig. 5C), the amphipods were, in a significant fraction of the\nexperiments, changing their orientation in an\necologically appropriate direction with\nchanges in lunar azimuth (fig. 7C).\n\nQuestion V\nWhat is the evidence, based on experiments performed within a single night, that\nthe amphipods change their orientation, relative to the Moon, in the appropriate direction?\nTrue Moon-compass orientation should\ninvolve two phenomena : compensation for\nchanges in lunar position during each night,\nand compensation between nights for changes\nin lunar position with changes in lunar phase.\nThe mechanism might be the same, but that\nremains only hypothesis; different kinds of\nevidence must be examined to determine\nwhether the two phenomena are demonstrable, and both kinds of evidence are intermingled in the graphs of figures 6 and 7.\nThe data which show the clearest evidence for appropriate compensation within\nsingle nights are summarized in figures 8 and\n9, and include four nights of data from the\n\nSESSION\n\n30"\n\nV: SENSORY MECHANISMS-OTHER\n\n.\n\n-\n\n535\n\n8\n\n8\n\nI\n\n900\n\nI\n\nI\n\n10\n2\xc2\xb0\n\nI\n\nI\n\n150"\n\n180\xc2\xb0\n\n210\xc2\xb0\n\n30"I\n\nI\n240"\n\n1200\n\nLUNAR AZIMUTH\n\nI\n\nI\n\n%NAR\n\nI\n\n180\xc2\xb0\n\nI\n\n210\xc2\xb0\n\n240\xc2\xb0\n\nAZIMUTH\n\nI\n270\xc2\xb0\n\nB\n\nA\n6\' .\n0\n\n3\' .\n0\n\nB\n\n0 .\n\nE\n\nE -300\nw\n\n.$-60\'\n\n.\n\n-90\'t\n\n.\n\nI\n\n120"\n\n150-\n\nBOo\n\n210"\n\n240\xc2\xb0\n\nI\n\nI\n\n120"\n\n2700\n\n150"\n\n180"\n\nI\n210\'\n\nI\n\n.

Figure\n11C, which is based on eight sets of experiments with T . saltator in the San Rossore I1\nseries, indicates that in these experiments,\nalso, there was no consistent trend for the\nanimals to compensate within single nights.\nFinally no evidence for or against compensation within single nights can be derived from\n\nthe San Rossore I experiments. Within a single night, the largest change of lunar azimuth\nbetween observations was loo, so the expected changes in orientation angle are too\nsmall to be detectable.\nIn summary of these data, then, the evidence is unequivocal that talitrid amphipods\nhave, in some experimental series, shown\nchanges in orientation angle relative to the\nMoon daring a single night, even when maintained in complete darkness prior to observation. These changes involve approximately\nappropriate compensation for changes in\nlunar azimuth. In my opinion, however, the\nevidence is equally clear that the animals do\nnot always show this capacity (fig. 11A, B\nand C ) . The reasons for these failures are at\npresent unknown, but various possible experimental complications will be considered in a\nsubsequent section,\nQuestion V I\n\nAre the amphipods able to compensate in\ntheir orientation for day of the lunar month?\n\n538\n\nANIMAL ORIENTATION AND NAVIGATION\n6\'\n0\n\nB\nz\n\xe2\x82\xac\nB\n\n24ED 64\nEXPECTED\n\n300\n\n0\n0\n\nE:\nz\n\n0\n\n0\n\nI\n\nI\n\n20\n4\'\n\na\n\nI\n\n210\'\n\n.\n\n0\n\n< -60\xc2\xb0\nI\n180\'\n\n.\n\n-3OO\n\n270\xc2\xb0\n\n180\xc2\xb0\n\n150\xc2\xb0\n\n210\xc2\xb0\n\nLUNAR AZIMUTH\n\nA\n\n240\xc2\xb0\n\nLUNAR AZIMUTH\n\nB\n6\'\n0\n\n.\n17X 64\n\n3-30:\nic7\n\nz\nc -60\'\n\n0\n\nI\n\n150\'\n\nI\n210\'\n\nI\n\n180\'\n\n*\n\nI\n\n20\n4\'\n\nI\n27@*\n\nLUNAR AZIMUTH\n\nC\nFIGURE 9 Good results showing compensation for changes in lunar azimuth w t i experi.\nihm\nrm\nments from single nights.

I t is conceivable that the amphipods might use some\n\nvariant of the 24-hr endogenous rhythmicity,\nwhich is presumably responsible for Sun-compass orientation, in order to accomplish\nchanges in orientation angle during the\nnight; the "successful results" of figures 8\nand 9 could easily be described by a change\nin angle of 15" per hour such as is implicit in\nSun orientation.

Data\nfrom Naples experiments (Appendix 1).\n\nwhich, on the basis of ecological considerations might be considered largely \xe2\x80\x9cunsuccessful\xe2\x80\x9d (fig. 5C), showed relatively consistent\nevidence for conformity to this expected\ntrend (fig. 14).\nAt the very least, a simple daily rhythm\nseems completely inadequate to account for\nthe data as presented in figures 12, 13, and\n1 . The amphipods seem able to compensate\n4\nto some extent for changes in day of the\nlunar cycle.\n\nQuestion VI1\nWhat experimental factors might account\nfor some of the variability in the Moon orientation of the amphipods?\nA very serious problem for the interpretation of data on Moon orientation of talitrids\nis that the performances of the animals are so\noften inconsistent with or contradictory to\nthe Moon-compass hypothesis. It is my opin-\n\nion that the sources of this variability are at\npresent largely unknown, although some possible sources deserve detailed consideration.\nIn a criticism of my La Jolla experiments\n(especially those of fig. 11Bj , Papi and Pardi\n(ref. 5) attempt to explain the poor performance by emphasizing the fact that I did not\nheat and dehydrate the air in the observation\nchamber. It is their contention (refs. 2 and\n5) that when talitrids are placed in an orientation chamber at night, the animals initially show a simple positive phototaxis, orienting directly toward the Moon, and only\ngradually thereafter, during some several\nminutes, assume the correct direction of orientation, at some angle to the lunar position.\nIt is claimed that the heating or dehydration\nof the chamber provides the \xe2\x80\x9creleasing stimulus\xe2\x80\x9d for reorientation away from positive\nphototaxis.\nThe initial observations of Moon orientation of talitrids (ref. 2) purportedly required dehydration of the air in the chamber; the documentation for this claim consists\nof one example (ibid.,fig. 7) which is somewhat unconvincing ; the initial orientation\nwas purportedly complicated by skyglow\nfrom city lights. In a subsequent paper, Papi\nand Pardi (ref. 3) stated that dehydration of\nthe air is unnecessary, but asserted (without\nsupporting data) that heating the chamber is\ndesirable, a procedure which they substituted\nfor dehydration in all subsequent experiments. It should be noted, however, that\nsome relatively successful experimental observations have been made without either\ndrying or heating the observation chamber\nartificially (fig. 8B), and some experiments in\nwhich the observations depart very markedly\nfrom \xe2\x80\x9cexpectations\xe2\x80\x9d were made in a chamber\nin which the air was both heated and dehydrated (Naples experiments, fig. 10B, C and\nD;and fig. 11A) or at least heated to 20\xc2\xb0C\n(data of Craig) ; footnote 2\n.\n\nSESSION\n\nV: SENSORY MECHANISMS-OTHER\n\nMy own data lend very little support to\nthe interpretation of Papi and Pardi; neither\nthe initial positive phototaxis, nor consistently\nmore correct reorientation after exposure to\n\xe2\x80\x9creleasing stimuli\xe2\x80\x9d can be well documented\nin the data. In the La Jolla experiments, the\npublished data are based on animals which\nwere photographed during their first minute\nin the orientation chamber which was neither\nheated nor dehydrated. Both on nights of\n\xe2\x80\x9cpoor\xe2\x80\x9d performance and of \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d performance, the initial angle of orientation averaged\nabout 120\xe2\x80\x9d, a radical departure from positive\nphototaxis. The smallest observed angle of\norientation, relative to the Moon, was more\nthan 50\xe2\x80\x9d away from positive phototaxis.\nIn my Naples and Malibu experiments,\nthe amphipods were removed from their\ndarkened containers, rapidly placed in the\norientation chamber (which was heated and\ncontained CaCI, to dehydrate the air) and\ntheir positions were then photographed\nwithin one minute of their initial exposure to\n\nTABLE\n3.-Changes\nExperimental series\n\n543\n\nmoonlight. The animals were then left undisturbed for 5 min, and a second photograph\nwas taken. The difference between initial orientation and that after 5 min showed an\noverall trend toward greater angles with the\nMoon after 5 min, such as might be expected\nif the animals were becoming less positively\nphototactic. The differences were, however,\nusually very small (table 3 ) , and may represent an effect of the photographic lighting\nwhich accompanied the first photographs,\nsuch as is discussed below under the consideration of multiple photoflashes. Furthermore,\nthe initial orientations were generally consistently different from simple positive phototaxis.

The possibility\nvations; the phenomenon, therefore, should exists that such a series of light flashes might\nnot be considered common, nor invoked as a affect the performance of the animals, and I\ngeneral explanation for the inconsistencies in have published suggestive evidence that this\nis the case (ref. 4) : in two experiments, with\nthe available data.\nSince all published experiments of the ten photographs each, taken within 15 min,\nItalian workers involve orientation of animals the animals significantly decreased their angle\nwhich had been 5 min or longer in the orien- of orientation relative to the Moon, from first\ntation chamber, I have used the data from to last photograph; in one case, by 68", in\nsecond photographs (taken after 5 min) in the other, by 48\'.

It is probably also advisable to tenth photograph in five cases out of six, with\nheat and dehydrate the observation chamber a median decrease of 33".

In this latter study,\nhowever, the changes were all small, with a\nmedian decrease of only 7\xe2\x80\x9d. Differences in\nexperimental methods may well be responsible for the fact that Papi and Pardi recorded\nmuch smaller changes than I. Their procedure of photographing the animals from beneath rather than from above would be expected to reduce greatly the intensity of the\nlight which the animals experience from the\nphotoflash.\nIn my opinion, it still seems desirable, as I\nhave previously suggested (ref. 4), to make\nonly a minimum number of photographs of\nthe animals\xe2\x80\x99 positions, with each group of\nanimals, when using photoflash ; this precaution seems particularly important when photoflash is given from above. It should be\nborne in mind that the additional data obtainable from multiple photographs do not\nadd appreciably to the statistical reliability of\nthe data, since, in my opinion, degrees of\nfreedom should be based on observations\nfrom different animals. The performance of\nthe species under a given treatment can be\nfar better evaluated by single photographs of\nseparate groups of amphipods, shilarly\ntreated, than by multiple photographs of the\nsame, single group-even if the photoflash\nwere to have a negligible influence. This\nmethodological problem, however, is unlikely\nto account for a major portion of the inconsistencies in the orientational performances\nevident in the data discussed here. My own\ndata, which include both good and poor performances, are not based on such series of\nmultiple photographs.\nMany of the available data lend support\nto the interpretation that there is greater in-\n\n545\n\nternal consistency in the orientations observed\nof a group of animals at times of full Moon\nthan at first and last quarters of the Moon.\nThe vector length, (which is inversely related\nto the degree of scatter within an experiment) shows an overall consistent trend toward greater values at full Moon than at\nother lunar phases. Highly significant differences can be demonstrated in several of the\ndata series (table 4). This trend is, of course,\nnot surprising, since the full Moon provides a\nmuch brighter stimulus object than does the\nMoon at first and last quarters. The trend\nlends further, indirect support to the conclusion drawn to Question I1 above, that the\nMoon is the major factor responsible for\nnighttime orientation. The lesser scatter of\ndirectional choices within an experiment\nwould mean that the average direction observed of the orientation of a group of animals is likely to be more reliably estimated at\ntimes of full Moon, but this consideration,\nalso, seems unable to account for a major\nportion of the inconsistencies in the data\navailable.\nOn the assumption that the orientation is,\nindeed, based on position of the Moon, one\nmust also presume that compensation for\nchanges in lunar azimuth is based, in some\nmanner, on an internal physiological timing\nprocess. It is, then, to be expected that presumably free-running \xe2\x80\x9cinternal clocks\xe2\x80\x9d\nshould, on the average, show a trend toward\ndeviation from correct orientation when the\nanimals have been kept for longer intervals\n(in some cases, more than 2 weeks) in the\nlaboratory. There is certainly a consistent\ntrend for the amphipods to be less well oriented (i.e. shorter vectors are observed,\nimplying greater scatter within the group)\nwhen the animals have been maintained for\nseveral days in the laboratory under constant\nconditions (see table 1) .

The overall\nimpression conveyed by the data is that the\naverage rate of the timing process differs very\nlittle from the appropriate value of about\n14.5" per hr. This conclusion should, however, be examined in more detail.\nVery good performances involving time\ncompensation have often been observed of\nanimals which were collected sometime\nwithin the day preceding the experiment\n(ref. 2 ; tables 1 and 2 of ref. 3; table 2 of\nref. 4 ; ref. 6 ; and the July data from my\nMalibu experiments) , although there are\nsome exceptions (table 1 of ref. 4 ; and parts\nof my Naples experiments). See Appendix 1.\nGood orientation was also observed in the\nMalibu experiments, on October 17 and 18,\nof animals kept for 2 and 3 days in complete\ndarkness. The only extensive series of "successful" experiments in which the animals had\n\nProbability of no difference\n\np <.05, t test\np <.01, t test\n\np<.OOl, F test\n\np <.001, t test\n\nbeen kept undisturbed in the laboratory for\nlonger than 3 days are the data in table 3 of\nref. 3, the relevant parts of which are reproduced here as table 5 .\nIt appears that the simplest interpretation\nof the data for the animals collected in June\nis that they oriented with an essentially constant angle toward the Moon; there is no\nappreciable correlation between observation\nand expectation ( p > 0 . 5 0 ) . Thus, the only\ndata which lend some support to the hypothesis, that talitrids can orient with compensation for changes in the direction of the Moon\nafter prolonged maintenance in constant\ndarkness, are the data from the animals collected in July (four observations shown in\nthe lower part of table 5 ) only two of which\ndiffer appreciably from those of the animals\ncollected in June.\nIt is my opinion, then, that insufficient\ndata are available to draw conclusions about\nthe long-term precision of the biological timing processes which underlie Moon-compass\norientation. Good evidence for the continuous operation of the timing process for 2 to 3\ndays is available, which can sometimes permit\nthe animals to compensate correctly ( & about\n30\') for changes in lunar azimuth (Malibu\n\nSESSION\n\nV: S E N S O R Y MECHANISMS-OTHER\n\nTABLE\n5.-Orientation\n\nof\n\n547\n\nAmphipods Collected at Preceding New Moona\n\nDate of experiment\n\nDays since\n\nAngle expected\n\nAngle observed\n\nAnimals Collected June 19\n1\n\nJuly 2 ........................................\nJuly4 ........................................\n\n............................\n\nJuly 9 ........................................\nJuly 9 ........................................\nJuly 10.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n..............\nJuly 10 .......................................\n\n13\n15\n15\n19\n19\n19\n20\n20\n\n92"\n117"\n96"\n132"\n112"\n95"\n151"\n135"\n\n~\n\n123"\n114"\n102"\n116"\n134"\n139"\n123"\n131"\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAnimals collected July 18\n\nAug 4.\nE\n\n......................................\n\n11\n15\n16\n\n123"\n90"\n\n120"\n126"\n\nData from ref. 3.\n\ndata) ; and the animals are often not completely disoriented, after 2 to 3 weeks under\nconstant conditions (table 5, and parts of\ntable 1 from ref. 4),but these latter data do\nnot necessarily implicate internal timing\nprocesses.

I\nwould, nevertheless, in concluding this review, like to propose an hypothesis which is\ncompatible with several of the more interesting aspects of the data. This hypothesis is, in\nfact, only a minor variant of the Moon-com-\n\npass hypothesis of Papi and Pardi, and 1 cannot present the hypothesis with the enthusiastic advocacy of a firm believer. My position\nis, instead, that this is an unattractive hypothesis which I offer provisionally, in the\nlack of any better alternatives but with the\nhope that it will eventually be disproven.\nThe hypothesis consists of three propositions :\n( 1 ) Observed cases of compensation for\nchanges in direction of the Moon are based\non an internal physiological rhythm with a\nperiod of about 25 hours which can persist\nfor at least several days under constant conditions (also the proposal of Papi and Pardi,\nrefs. 3 and 5 ) .\n(2) The zeitgeber for this rhythm may be\neither Moonlight or some factor associated\nwith the tides (probably the former, in view\nof the recorded changes in the orientation\ndue to treatments with light), but, in any\ncase, the zeitgeber is not as compelling an\n\n548\n\nANIMAL O R I E N T A T I O N AND NAVIGATION\n\nentraining agent as the daily cycle, so that\neven freshly collected animals, under some\nfield conditions, may not have recently experienced synchronizing stimuli.\n( 3 ) If talitrids have been long removed\nfrom environmental entrainment, either artificially or naturally, the internal rhythmicity\nno longer exerts appreciable influence on the\nangle of lunar orientation; the system deteriorates into constant-angle orientation, with\nan angle which is determined by the beach of\norigin, but may be modifiable by lighting\nconditions.\nAt least four alternatives to this hypothesis have been proposed :\n(1) Van den Becken et al. (ref. 8) have\nsuggested that the amphipods do not, in fact,\nnecessarily rely on tile Moon for nocturnal\norientation, but instead rely upon some other\ngeophysical directional clue. As discussed previously, this hypothesis seems to me to lack\nadequate supporting data.\n(2) I have previously suggested (ref. 4)\nthat the amphipods might utilize a singlecycle time-compensation process initiated by\nt!ie stimulus of moonrise. As discussed above,\nthe evidence against this proposal is now\noverwhelming.\n( 3 ) Hoffmann (ref. 11) has suggested\nthat the amphipods might utilize their Suncompass orientation at night, with corrections\napplied on the basis of the shape of the lunar\ndisc. The fact that successful mirror experiments have been performed both before and\nafter full Moon (fig. lA), as well as the fact\nthat good orientation has been observed during a partial eclipse of the Moon (ref. 2),\nseem to argue against this hypothesis, as does\nthe required visual acuity.\n(4) Horridge (ref. 12) has proposed that\nthe animals could utilize their Sun-compass\nwith corrections based on the rate of change\nof lunar altitude. This hypothesis is apparently contradicted by the fact that in success-\n\nful mirror experiments, the altitude of the\nmirror, whether 30\xe2\x80\x9d or 60\xc2\xb0, had no evident\ninfluence on the results (fig. 1A). Furthermore, this hypothesis, as proposed, is even less\nesthetically pleasing to me than the Moomcompass hypothesis. Even granted the sensory\ncapacity of the animals to recognize, within a\nfew seconds time, the rate of change of lunar\nazimuth and altitude, the application of a\ncorrection based on this information seems to\nme to be an extremely complicated process.\nIn my opinion, then, the data on lunar\norientation of talitrids which require an explanation (especially fig. 4 and 5) can best\nbe accounted for by the Moon-compass hypothesis, with the modifications proposed\nabove-this, in spite of the fact that the assumption of two independent clocks makes\nthe hypothesis basically unattractive to me.\n\nSUMMARY\n( 1) Talitrid amphipods, when deprived\nof all obvious orienting stimuli except a view\nof the Moon and stars, usually (but not always) show non-random orientations which\nare internally consistent between replicate experiments.\n( 2 ) Reflection of the image of the Moon\nfrom a mirror onto the amphipods usually\nproduces major deviations in their directions\nof orientation, indicating that lunar position\nis the main, and probably the only significant\norienting stimulus in these experiments.\n( 3 ) When non-random orientation is observed, the directions of orientation are\nusually, but not always, ecologically appropriate, that is, in a compass direction which\nwould be seaward on the beach of origin,\n2 6 0 \xe2\x80\x9d ; and are often within k 3 0 \xe2\x80\x9d of this\n\xe2\x80\x9ccorrect\xe2\x80\x9d direction.\n(4) The angle of orientation relative to\nthe Moon changes appropriately, in at least a\nqualitative sense, with changes in the direc-\n\nSESSION\n\n549\n\nV: SENSORY MECHANISMS-OTHER\n\ntion of the Moon. Some experimental series\nshow close correspondence, and others relatively weak agreement, with inconsistencies\nbetween nights, but the changes are statistically significant in all experimental series for\nwhich quantitative data are available.\n(5) In some cases, the animals have\nclearly shown appropriate changes in the\nangle of orientation during series of experiments conducted within a single night, but in\ncther cases, no significant change in the angle\nd wing the night has been observed.\n(6) In most experimental series, freshlycollected animals have shown some tendency\nto change their angle of orientation, for a\ngiven time of night, from one night to the\nnext in an approximately appropriate manner to compensate for changes in day of the\nlunar cycle.\n( 7 ) Prolonged laboratory maintenance of\nthe animals under constant conditions weakens the tendency for significant orientation to\nthe Moon, and the orientations observed suggest that the capacity of the animals may\ndeteriorate as to the choice of a direction\nwhich is at a constant angle from the azimuth of the Moon. Sometimes freshly collected animals show a similar tendency.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe Naples experiments (Appendix 1)\nwere performed during the tenure of a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship; the Malibu experiments (Appendix\n2) were supported by grant GB 2469 from\nthe National Science Foundation; data analysis and preparation of this manuscript were\nsupported by grant GB 5471 from the National Science Foundation. J. Aschoff offered\nhis encouragement and support for the Naples experiments; Frau Ute Arch (nee Wagner) gave technical assistance. Richard\nSwade and Ronald Quinn were of great help\nduring the Malibu experiments. And finally, I\nmust express my admiration for the accomplishment of F. Papi and L. Pardi in their\ndiscovery of Moon-compass orientation. I\nhave, in this review, treated their data with\ncautious-and perhaps overly harsh-skepticism, but no reservations about specific aspects of their data can detract from the fact\nthat, in my opinion, they were fundamentally\ncorrect in their initial interpretation.

Ercolini, have served to\nmaintain my interest in talitrid orientation.\n\nAPPENDIX 1\nNaples Experiments"\nDate\n(1964)\n\nCET)\n\nLunar\nazimuth\n(deg)\n\n21 :41\n22.18\n23:OO\n2320\n00 09\n01 :25\n01 :58\n21 :26\n\n217\n231\n244\n251\n259\n272\n276\n130\n\nTime\n\n__-\n\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n4\n8\n\nIV\nIV\nIV\nIV\nIV\nIV\nIV\nIV\n\nhientation\nazimuth\n(deg)\n201\n227\n21 1\n240\n249\n242\n258\n160\n\nVector\nlength\n\n0.81\n0.92\n0.63\n0.65\n0.38\n0.53\n0.79\n0.33\n\nNumber\no animals\nf\n\n16\n11\n25\n24\n25\n25\n17\n22\n\nignificanca Days\nlevel\nsince\ncollectior\n.01\n.Ol\n.01\n.Ol\n.05\n.Ol\n.Ol\n.05\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n3\n\nLunar\nstage :\ndays\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n14\n\nANIMAL ORIENTATION AND NAVIGATION\n\n550\n\nAPPENDIX 1.-(continued)\nDate\n\n(1964)\n8 IV\n8 IV\n8 IV\n8 IV\n8 IV\n8 IV\n8 IV\n8 IV\n9 IV\n9 IV\n9 IV\n9 IV\n9 IV\n9 IV\n9 IV\n9 IV\n10 IV\n10 IV\n10 IV\n10 IV\n10 IV\n11 IV\n11 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n14 IV\n\n16 IV\n16 IV\nr 16 IV\n16 IV\n16 IV\n16 IV\n16 IV\n16 IV\n16 IV\n\n.\n\nTime\n(CEV\n\nLunar\nazimuth\n(deg)\n\n3rientation\nazimuth\n(deg)\n\nVector\nlength\n\nVumber\nf animair\n\nignificano\nlevel\n\n21:36\n21:57\n22:23\n22:53\n23:06\n23:20\n23:37\n23:53\n00:24\n00:50\n01.08\n01:26\n02:20\n02 :34\n03:08\n03:39\n22:03\n22:13\n22:28\n23:48\n23:54\n00:02\n00:14\n00:39\n00:47\n00:55\n01:07\n01 18\n01 :32\n01:42\n02:02\n02:09\n03:15\n03:24\n03:43\n04:07\n02:01\n02:09\n02:16\n02:24\n02:31\n02:39\n02:47\n02:57\n03:16\n\n132\n137\n146\n154\n158\n163\n169\n174\n185\n194\n200\n206\n221\n225\n233\n240\n125\n127\n131\n150\n151\n153\n157\n135\n137\n138\n141\n143\n146\n149\n153\n155\n171\n173\n178\n184\n!3\n3\n134\n136\n138\n139\n140\n142\n144\n148\n\n170\n181\n159\n169\n227\n208\n176\n176\n167\n239\n241\n231\n233\n211\n228\n252\n163\n174\n172\n175\n173\n143\n105\n218\n199\n180\n161\n159\n161\n217\n184\n186\n210\n186\n142\n175\n103\n186\n127\n151\n157\n195\n131\n198\n\n0.56\n0.57\n0.6\n0.47\n0.62\n0.50\n0.56\n0.54\n0.43\n0.87\n0.67\n0.63\n0.62\n0.39\n0.39\n0.39\n0.65\n0.66\n0.83\n0.71\n0.75\n0.53\n0.70\n0.74\n0.84\n0.61\n0.44\n0.53\n0.45\n0.72\n0.84\n0.62\n0.72\n0.53\n0.80\n0.50\n0.50\n0.68\n0.37\n0.50\n0.42\n0.39\n0.56\n0.55\n0.62\n\n26\n27\n16\n16\n9\n18\n31\n20\n17\n21\n22\n23\n22\n23\n31\n16\n26\n25\n17\n15\n22\n18\n22\n24\n15\n21\n17\n26\n23\n16\n18\n23\n16\n20\n6\n23\n13\n21\n24\n16\n19\n23\n22\n20\n22\n\nIO1\n.01\n.01\n.05\n.05\n\n155\n\n.01\n\n.Ol\n.01\n\n.05\n.01\n.01\n\n.Ol\n*0\n1\n.05\n\n.oi\n.05\n\n.Ol\n\n?aVs\nsince\nidlection\n\n5\n3\n5\n5\n5\n6\n5\n3\n3\n5\n5\n6\n5\n3\n5\n5\n5\n\n.Ol\n.Ol\n.Ol\n.01\n.Ol\n\n0\n5\n5\n0\n\n.01\n\n0\n1\n\n.01\n.01\n\n5\n8\n\n.01\n\n1\n\n.05\n\n3\n\n.61\n\n1\n\n.Ol\n.01\n.0\n1\n.Ol\n.Ol\n.Ol\n\n3\n1\n8\n1\n1\n8\n\n.05\n\n1\n\n.Ol\n.05\n.Ol\n\n0\n\n3\n10\n\n.05\n.05\n\n0\n\n.05\n.05\n.Ol\n.Ol\n.Ol\n\n0\n\n3\n3\n0\n\n5\n3\n\nLunar\nstage:\ndays\n\n14\n14\n1\n4\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n19\n19\n19\n19\n19\n19\n19\n19\n19\n19\n19\n19\n19\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n\nSESSION\n\nV : SENSORY MECHANISMS-OTHER\n\n55 1\n\n1 1 1 1\n\nAPPENDIX 1.-( concluded).\n(1964)\n\nDate\n\nTime\n(CET)\n\nLunar\nazimuth\n(deg)\n\n16 IV\n16 IV\n16 IV\n\n03:26\n04:02\n04:17\n\n150\n158\n161\n\nI\n\nI\n\n!\n\nOrientation\nazimuth\n(deg)\n\nvector\nlength\n\n145\n233\n11\n4\n\n0.6C\n0.65\n0.47\n\nI\n\nNumber Significance c o ~ ~ o n\nof animals\nlevel\nsince\nstage:\n\nI\n\nExperimental animals (Tulitrus s ~ l t ~ t owere collected during daylight hours at several sites along the\nr)\nf\nstraight, continuous beach located about 40 km northwest o Naples. \xe2\x80\x9cCorrect\xe2\x80\x9d orientation, perpendicular to\nthat shore line, is at an azimuth of 2 5 .

This is consistent with the few data\nwhich are available. I t is also true, however, that\nanimals that have been kept in the laboratory for a\nlonger period of time are less likely to show any\nconsistent choice of direction and one must distinguish between these two.\nSHOOPDo you have any data on individual be:\nhavior as related to group behavior? Do individuals\nrespond as groups do? Are these all group data\nthat you presented?\nENRIGHT:These are all group data. My own\nqualitative impression is that the animals do not influence each other\'s choice of direction very much\neven though they crawl over and bump into each\nother occasionally.\nGRIFFIN: Is it true that the animals oriented in\nthe opposite way under water?\nENRIGHT:Yes, but there was no claim for this\nwith regard to the Moon compass orientation. The\nreverse orientation was claimed only for Sun orientation, and I have been unable to reproduce this\nobservation. Animals actually swimming in sea\nwater seem to orient in the same direction as those\nin a dry chamber. There is an additional complication. I t is now claimed in the literature that talitrids\norient in the same direction as they do in a dry\nchamber, if you put them in fresh water; it is only\nin salt water that they orient away from the beach.\nWALCOTT:\nWhat would be the consequence in\nthe orientation if your animals were using a time\nclock based on the Sun rather than on the Moon?\nENRIGHT: It would vary from night to night,\nand hour to hour.\nBULLOCK:Curt Richter cites many cases of\nrhythm in humans which are only manifested after\nsome kind of clinical experience that he regards as\na shock. I n other words, he supposes that the endogenous clock is there, but it is not a single clock. It\nis a lot of independently phased cells, which are in-\n\ndividually going along at the normal rate, but out\nof step with each other. Some special environmental trigger, which he calls clinical shock in the\nhuman patients, brings all these cells into synchronization so that they can take control of the organism and the rhythm then becomes manifest in overt\nsigns.\nENRIGHT: have difficulty imagining what the\nI\nenvironmental trigger could be.\nBULLOCK:\nMight it be moonrise or is it the time\nthe animal emerges from the sand?\nENRIGHT:I have a hard time imagining how\nMoon synchronization of this kind of a clock would\nwork, even though I have proposed the hypothesis.\nBULLOCK: it the other way around. I t is the\nPut\ncold or the fog that lets the cells, the numerous endogenous clocks that have the same intrinsic\nrhythm, drift apart. When the animal can see the\nenvironmental sign, all his endogenous clocks get\ninto synchrony, so that they, in your words, take\ncontrol.\nWATERMAN:\nWhy do you assume that the\nMoon rather than the tides synchronizes this\nrhythm?\nENRIGHT: the Pacific coast the tidal factors\nOn\ncould represent a very good synchronizing agent for\nsome sort of a lunar rhythmicity. The best argument against this, however, is that tides in the\nMediterranean area are of very small amplitude\nand the animals live so far up the beach that direct\nexperience of the tides seems unlikely.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
