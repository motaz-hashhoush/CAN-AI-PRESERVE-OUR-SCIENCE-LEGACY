The goal of the first mission, which will be uncrewed,\nis to demonstrate the integrated system performance of the SLS rocket and spacecraft before\na crewed flight in 2021. SLS has many of the same logistics challenges as any other large\nscale program. Common logistics concerns for SLS include integration of discreet programs\ngeographically separated, multiple prime contractors with distinct and different goals,\nschedule pressures and funding constraints. However, SLS also faces unique challenges. The\nnew program is a confluence of new hardware and heritage, with heritage hardware\nconstituting seventy-five percent of the program. This unique approach to design makes\nlogistics concerns such as commonality especially problematic. Additionally, a very low\nmanifest rate of one flight every four years makes logistics comparatively expensive. That,\nalong with the SLS architecture being developed using a block upgrade evolutionary\napproach, exacerbates long-range planning for supportability considerations. These\ncommon and unique logistics challenges must be clearly identified and tackled to allow SLS\nto have a successful program. This paper will address the common and unique challenges\nfacing the SLS programs, along with the analysis and decisions the NASA Logistics\nengineers are making to mitigate the threats posed by each.\n\nI. SLS Design Architecture\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Launch System Program (SLSP) is the latest initiative in human space exploration and this\nambitious program is challenged to meet significant innovative technical objectives in the midst of a national austere\nfunding environment. The SLS vehicle concept utilizes an innovative \xe2\x80\x9cmelding\xe2\x80\x9d of technologies, key concepts from\nthe family of Saturn launch vehicles used during the Apollo Program, as well as designs and technologies from the\nmore recent Space Shuttle and Constellation Programs. Figure 1 illustrates the SLS planned evolving architecture\nand Figure 2 shows the initial Block 1 configuration. While the SLSP design solution will evolve by incorporating\nthe latest technology for propulsion, the first flights will make extensive use of heritage hardware to shorten\ndevelopment time and reduce the design cost. The SLS Elements consist of the Stages, Liquid Engines, Booster,\nAdvanced Development, Spacecraft and Payload Integration, and Ground Operations Liaison.\n1\n\nSupportability Engineering/ILS Lead, MSFC Mission Operations Laboratory, Operations Engineering/EO40.\nPresident, Logistics Management Associates, 19 Woodlawn, Irvine, CA, 92620.\n3\nSystem Engineer, System Engineering Management Office, Chief Engineers Office.\n4\nOperations Discipline Lead Engineer, MSFC Mission Operations Laboratory/EO04.\n5\nIntegrated Logistics Support Technical Lead, MSFC Mission Operations Laboratory/EO40.\n6\nLogistics Technical Integration Manager, Logistics Development and Integration Branch/GP-L1.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n2\n\nOne of the key measures of success for the SLSP is remaining within the overall budget established by Congress\nwhile meeting the baselined launch date. NASA has long recognized that the concepts and processes of Integrated\nLogistics Support (ILS) and Logistics Support Analysis (LSA) provide a significant opportunity to minimize cost of\nownership. NASA has established policy mandating program life-cycle logistics support through applicable phases\nand inclusion of supportability as part of the system\xe2\x80\x99s design characteristics to assist in ensuring system availability\nand affordability. 1\n\nFigure 1. SLS Architecture Evolution.\n\nFigure 2. SLS 70 metric-ton Initial Block 1 Configuration, 321 feet tall.\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nII. Traditional ILS Application\nTraditional application of ILS during the design, development, test, and evaluation (DDT&E) of a system\ntypically consists of two different but highly related processes, designing a supportable system and then developing\na reasonable, responsive and cost effective support solution for the system. 2 This approach to ILS has been proven\ninnumerable times by the US Department of Defense (DoD) as being effective and extremely beneficial through\nreduction of support infrastructures and increases in system operational availability.\nFigure 3 illustrates how the expected application of ILS during system DDT&E consists of supportability\nengineering within the systems engineering process to assure that the system design defined for operation, when\nused within the mission profile and environmental limitations, will produce a design that required the lowest\npossible in-service support solution. Then maintenance task analysis (MTA) provides the foundation for\ndevelopment of the physical support resource package necessary to sustain the system over its possibly 30-50 year\noperational life. One of the basic premises of ILS is that a higher quality system will require far less support when\nin-service. Increasing system reliability, maintainability and testability, which can increase cost during development,\ncan reasonably result in a much lower cost of ownership by reducing the logistics footprint, i.e. personnel, spares,\nfacilities and other cost drivers, during in-service operation and support.\n\nFigure 3. Integrated Logistics Support During System Development.\nThe specific application techniques and schemes for traditional ILS vary by technology, industry and\norganization; however, normally the functions shown at Fig. 4 are typically contained in all participants.\nSupportability engineering normally consists of LSA, human factors integration (HFI) and reliability and\nmaintainability (R&M) in a coordinated approach to design improvement that includes bottoms-up estimates for life\ncycle cost (LCC). The traditional Logistics Products include; technical manuals or publications (TM/P); initial\nprovisioning of spares and other materials required for maintenance (IP); support equipment, test equipment and\ntools (S&TE) required for operation and maintenance support; training (TNG) for all associated personnel in\noperation, support and maintenance; packaging, handling, storage and transportability (PHST) of the system and all\nsupport resources; and all facilities (FAC) required for operation, support, maintenance, training or storage.\nResultant data is captured and managed in an LSA Record (LSAR) database. The consolidation of all these logistics\nproducts results in the logistics footprint required to operate and sustain the system throughout its operational life.\nThe success of this process is measured in terms of operational availability.\n\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 4. Typical Integrated Logistics Support Functions and Interrelated Processes.\nA simple comparison of traditional ILS concepts and processes with the unique circumstances of the SLSP\nindicates that application must be drastically different to be effective. The SLSP DDT&E phase will have one\nlaunch every four years, and each SLS vehicle will have significantly different technology baselines and physical\nhardware configurations. A large, costly logistics support infrastructure would be impractical and unaffordable. So,\nthe SLSP application of ILS has been adapted to select and maximize those processes that will contribute to the\nprogram goals while at the same time taking a significantly different approach to meeting potential physical logistics\nsupport requirements. SLSP is performing a comprehensive, but non-traditional ILS program. The remainder of this\npaper provides specific details of the unique application techniques of ILS on the SLSP to meet the challenges.\n\nIII. SLS Challenges and Threats\nSpace launch vehicle logistics have a complicated flow involving many vendors delivering parts and supplies to\nmanufacturing sites and launch sites. This supply chain is complex and involves several 100 vendors. Saturn V, for\nexample, had over 280 major subcontractors (not counting lower level subcontractors) with over 1000 vendors\nsupplying approximately 3,000,000 parts. Some of these vendors supported more than one stage, delivering\ncomponents to multiple manufacturing sites. 3 Over 100,000 logistical events were estimated for the fabrication of\nthe Saturn V. 4 This supply chain ultimately relates to many sources to a single site, different from many commercial\nsupply chain models. From the perspective of vendors that support multiple stages, this can appear as a one site to\nmany site support. Mapping all of these relationships leads to a very complex interconnection diagram. This can be\nsimplified by viewing the supply chain as two tiers: vendor to manufacturing site, and manufacturing site to launch\nsite. Figure 5 provides a simple illustration of this complex interconnection.\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 5. Two Phase Supply Chain.\nThe first tier of the supply chain is the manufacturing sites, where thousands of parts are assembled and\nintegrated into a vehicle stage or booster. A large portion of vendors support the manufacturing sites directly and the\nsupply chain for each of these sites is large and complex. In some cases one manufacturing site will feed to another.\nThis is the case for engines which feed the stage manufacturing site. Some stage or booster manufacturing can also\noccur at the launch site. Once the stage or booster has been produced, it is transferred to the launch site. This second\ntier is less complex than the first tier feeding the manufacturing sites. This tier can also have vendors delivering\ndirectly to the launch site for line replaceable unit (LRU) spares and consumables used in the assembly of the\nvehicle.\nThere are 3 types of delivery sources to the launch site: external manufacturing sites, internal (to the launch site)\nmanufacturing sites, and vendors. Regardless of the source, each must follow the same property delivery procedures\nto maintain control of materials and supplies transferred to the launch site facilities.\nTables 1 and 2 list the common and unique challenges and associated threats.\nTable 1. Common Challenges and Threats.\n\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nTable 2. Unique Challenges and Threats.\n\nIV. Logistics Support Analysis, Lessons Learned, and Initiatives\nLSA and ILS activities have been initiated to mitigate each threat and are contained in Tables 3 and 4 followed\nby the analysis approach for the evolving vehicle configuration. A tailored set of logistics data requirements was\nestablished by the SLSP and allocated to the Elements for results of analyses performed to identify maintenance\nsignificant items to include LRUs and associated logistics and maintenance resources required to maintain the flight\nand ground hardware in serviceable and flight ready condition. The SLSP ILS Team will use this data to identify\nlogistics risks and develop an affordable and cost-effective integrated support solution. Various initiatives and\nlessons learned are also discussed in this section.\nA. Analysis and Activities\nTable 3. Common Threats and Analysis/Activities.\n\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nTable 4. Unique Threats and Analysis/Activities.\n\nThe SLSP ILS team is conducting LSA for the integrated Block 1 configuration and will document the results in\nan SLSP LSA Report and related data will be captured in the SLSP LSA Record (LSAR) database. Logistics\nanalyses is tailored to focus on the hardware that is the same across the blocks as depicted in Fig. 6. Analyses of\ncommon hardware across the three configurations will provide the greatest opportunity to maximize affordability.\n\nFigure 6. Depiction of Common Hardware Across SLS Configurations\nTailoring of the supportability analyses and logistics engineering efforts should address the specific requirements\nfor each block configuration. Any item that will only be utilized in the Block 1 configuration, which will be for\nflights EM-1 and EM-2, should address support resource requirements. Maximum use should be made of existing\ndata generated during the original design and development of heritage hardware. The results of this analysis should\nbe a complete identification of all resources that will be required for support of the test flights. The resources will\nthen be assessed to determine the specific items that must be purchased and pre-positioned to reduce risk of nonavailability when required. It is envisioned that the items that appear in only Block 1 should be minimally supported\nwith little residual materials for disposition after the second test flight.\nThe Block 1A configuration will perform the majority of the currently planned operational SLS flights. Heritage\nhardware will be replaced with new design hardware. Therefore, analyses should focus on investing in the support\nrequirements from Block 1A implementation and beyond. Analyses should initially address design attributes and\ncharacteristics that have the potential to improve supportability and lower cost of ownership. Any item that will be\nin the Block 1A configuration should be subjected to the full range of analyses with intent to improve the design and\nreduce cost due to support requirements. Full application and documentation of supportability engineering should\nprovide evidence of results and serve as the basis for long term support development and investment.\nThe Block 2 configuration will perform the last few operational flights starting after Block 1A is completed.\nItems should be assessed for obsolescence and life time sustainment. New technology insertion and functional\nupgrades will require these items to be fully documented for sustainment and obsolescence management. These\nitems should be subjected to the same depth of analysis as items appearing in Block 1A integrated task analysis.\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nA tailored set of logistics data requirements was established by the SLSP and allocated to the Elements for\nresults of analyses performed to identify maintenance significant items to include LRUs and associated logistics and\nmaintenance resources required to maintain the flight and ground hardware in serviceable and flight ready\ncondition. 5 The SLSP will use this data to identify logistics risks and develop an affordable and cost-effective\nintegrated support solution.\nB. Lessons Learned\nLessons learned from recent space programs have been studied for application to the SLSP and progress has\nbeen made to apply several lessons learned from the NASA Space Shuttle Program, Space Station Program,\nConstellation Program, and Ares/Ares 1-X Projects. The Ares I rocket is the most recent similar vehicle to the\ncurrent SLS, and Ares was the first new design to emerge from NASA in 30 years and was envisioned to be the\nworkhorse of the NASA Constellation Program, which was established to replace the aging fleet of Space Shuttles.\nAres I-X was the first design concept demonstrator in the program and was successfully launched on October 28,\n2009.\nThe major logistics focus of the Ares I-X test flight was large element transportation and supplying material and\ntools to Ground Processing Operations. The development timeline was severely limited, and since Ares I-X was a\ntest flight, in many cases, logistics considerations were not infused into the design. 6 Maintainability, supportability,\ncommonality, standardization, testability, reliability, and availability were not considered. Operational access and\ntransportability were considered. Most of the \xe2\x80\x9cIlities\xe2\x80\x9d are not necessarily applicable to a test program since long\nterm sustainment is not an issue, but designers need to be sensitized to materials costs verses application for test\nprograms. For example: Were satellite qualified, radiation hardened tie wraps really necessary for a sub-orbital\nflight?\nThere were also numerous supply chain issues because the contractual supply chain responsibilities were not\nclear. In some cases flight hardware procurements were not compliant with NASA directives. Waivers had to be\nprocessed for the flight hardware that did not meet the stringent procurement and quality requirements. Logistics\nsupply support requirements should be defined prior to initiating contracts. The contractual responsibilities should\nbe clearly defined and a logistics support plan should be developed prior to contract initiation.\nReal time demands for flight material were constant since material quantities were uncertain because \xe2\x80\x9cAs\nRequired\xe2\x80\x9d quantity designation was used on drawings and parts lists. These shortages caused delays during vehicle\nprocessing because ground operations expected to receive the material they needed in minutes or hours, not weeks.\nIn addition to this situation, the procurement representatives experienced conflicting resource requirements once the\nvehicle was transferred to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for launch processing. Processes were not established to\nallow the transfer of material, so the Space Shuttle Program developed a Hardware Transfer Request process to\nenable transfer of Shuttle material to Ares I-X. The ground operations contractor should have the responsibility to\nprovide real time supply support and material from qualified suppliers for vehicle launch site integration processing\nand processes and procedures should be established for material transfer between programs and contracts.\nInventory management for material and Ground Support Equipment (GSE) was time consuming and resource\nintensive. Tracking material location required extensive manual effort. Researching availability of material for each\nflight element had to be done manually because the inventory information was in separate databases. There was no\nindication of who was accountable for the parts and, for excess parts, where they should be returned. A\ncomprehensive inventory tracking system is required to provide visibility into inventory location. A web based\nsystem and application of automatic identification technology using radio-frequency identification (RFID) should be\nconsidered.\nFollowing are summaries of progress for application of lessons learned.\n1. Implemented NASA Agency \xe2\x80\x9cProgram and Project Life-Cycle Logistics Support Policy\xe2\x80\x9d, NASA Policy Directive\n(NPD) 7500.1C and includes Supportability, ILS and LSA.\n2. SLSP established an engineering bottoms-up Life Cycle Cost estimating capability.\n3. SLSP established an ILS Team that includes Program, Elements, contractors, and collaboration with the launch\nsite.\n4. A Cross-Program Logistics Integration Team (LIT) was established and includes the three NASA Exploration\nPrograms.\n5. Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Supportability. Cost, and Testability considered in SLS vehicle design.\n6. Analysis is being accomplished to consider LRU remove and replace (R&R) steps and required supporting\nmaterials, tools and equipment.\n\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n7. Collaboration is on-going with the launch site for streamlined shipping and receiving processes, marking\ntechniques to ease identification of items, use of a common warehouse, and improved inventory management.\n8. Flight and ground hardware transfer points, processes, and procedures being addressed.\n9. Launch processing requirements for materials, fluids, and consumables being worked, to include plans to fund\nthe launch site to provide these common items.\n10. SLSP is clarifying Supply Chain Management (SCM) which includes the Elements and a subject matter expert\nstudy is in-progress.\n11. Commonality (Standardization) is included as an evolving consideration for materials and parts.\n12. Supportability Engineering exists as a discipline of Systems Engineering at Program level.\n13. SLSP Sustaining Engineering is part of early planning.\n14. Supportability metrics include Launch Availability (LA) and Maintenance Down Time (MDT).\nC. Initiatives\nSeveral initiatives have been implemented to assist in systems engineering and integration of design and\ndevelopment efforts, as well as planning for affordable operations. Following are summary examples.\n15. The SLS ILS Team provides a forum for technical interchange and includes Program and Element supportability\nand logistics engineers, as well as contractor representatives. The ILS Team focus is on designing an affordable ILS\nfootprint that achieves long term program goals (beyond block 1). SLSP ILS activities integrate and analyze element\nand vehicle logistics data for ground processing activities at KSC for hardware maintenance and supportability\nplanning.\n16. SLSP supportability assessments of the SLS Core Stage and Booster Elements\xe2\x80\x99 support concepts and\nmaintenance planning have been conducted to determine the extent to which supportability characteristics have\nbeen considered and incorporated in the system design, review tasks on potential high maintenance/supply support\ndrivers, recommend ground process improvements for maintenance tasks, and discuss supply support activities and\nconcerns. These assessments are an on-going activity for all SLS Elements.\n17. A common LSAR database, PowerLOG-J, has been established with the SLSP and the launch site to allow\ntransfer, integration, and report generation of logistics data. SLSP has developed and is implementing a tailored\nLSAR Database Style Guide, to include use of logistics control numbers (LCNs). The LSAR Style Guide enables\nconsistency and commonality in logistics data being developed independently by various organizations that will\nultimately be integrated into a single SLSP support knowledge base.\n18. An existing water barge is undergoing modification for use as the primary transport mode for large flight and\nground hardware which initially is the Core Stage.\n19. Supportability design considerations and operational support planning are being applied with equal importance\nto both Ground Support Equipment (GSE) and flight hardware.\n20. The current SLS integrated vehicle fault management (IVFM) model is being developed to provide extensive\nfailure mode detection capability against the established launch commit criteria (LCC) and planning efforts are\nunderway that propose to evolve the model to include fault isolation to a reasonable ambiguity group of 4-5 LRUs\nto enable performance of off-nominal repair during test or pre-launch activities at the launch site.\n21. Established the Logistics Support Date (LSD) as a management approach and tool to assure that all physical\nsupport resources and the support infrastructure required to support a system are in place and ready to provide any\nsupport prior to actual arrival of the system to be supported. After assessment of delivery schedules to the launch\nsite for SLS flight and ground hardware based on the September 15, 2013 integrated master schedule, April 15,\n2017 is determined to be the current LSD for the overall SLSP. Each Element of the SLSP has differing LSD dates\nbased on individual schedule and contractual requirements. The guidance for estimating a LSD is delivery date\nminus 90 days for flight hardware and delivery date minus 60 days for ground hardware.\n\nV. Decisions\nDecisions to determine the application of traditional ILS technologies and methodologies are driven by NASA\npolicy and SLSP implementation of policies for management and control, goals and objectives, cost constraints, and\nmission launch schedules. Primary influencing factors include seeking to maximize use of contractor best practices\nwith limited program-imposed management and control plans, recurring DDT&E phases for architecture block\nupgrades, flat budget with no inflation allowance, heritage hardware, and employing a risk-based approach for\nElement and contractor insight/oversight in an SE&I environment. Following are major decision points.\n\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nA. Tailor Traditional ILS Approach\n1. Ensure the vehicle support infrastructure is adequate, has everything we need\xe2\x80\xa6.nothing we don\xe2\x80\x99t.\n2. Ensure the design is successful within cost constraints.\n3. Integrate ILS efforts across the Elements for support of vehicle assembly and integration activities.\n4. Perform Logistics Support Analysis (LSA) for the integrated launch vehicle.\n5. Implement supportability engineering and integrate reliability, maintainability, testability, affordability, safety,\ncommonality, human factors, and availability.\n6. Establish ILS within the SE&I Operations Discipline Lead Engineering (ODLE) organization.\nB. Implement Life-Cycle Logistics Support\nC. SLSP LSD for Initial Flight is April 15, 2017\nD. Identify and Mitigate Supportability Risks for Block 1\n\nConclusion\nThe SLSP has taken a measured approach in applying both traditional and innovative concepts of supportability\nand logistics engineering. As indicated in this paper, the ILS Team has had the foresight to assess applicability,\nstudy past experiences, and develop unique solutions where necessary. The SLSP is proving to be a clear example\nwhere traditional logistics ideas can be molded, modified, and adapted to fit a totally different situation and still be\nexpected to provide the same benefits of increased operational availability for a lowered cost of ownership.\n\nReferences\n1\n\nNASA Logistics Management Division, NASA Policy Directive (NPD) 7500.1C, \xe2\x80\x9cProgram and Project Life-Cycle Logistics\nSupport Policy\xe2\x80\x9d, Washington, D.C., 2012, pp. 1.\n2\nUS Department of Defense, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Material Readiness, \xe2\x80\x9cProduct Support Manager\nGuidebook\xe2\x80\x9d, Washington, D.C., 2011, pp. 10, 37-38.\n3\nBilstein, Roger E.; \xe2\x80\x9cStages to Saturn\xe2\x80\x9d, NASA SP-4206. 1996, pg. 288.\n4\nBilstein, Roger E.; \xe2\x80\x9cStages to Saturn\xe2\x80\x9d, NASA SP-4206. 1996, pg. 297.\n5\nNASA Space Launch System Program (SLSP), \xe2\x80\x9cSLSP Data Requirements List\xe2\x80\x9d, SLS-RQMT-018, Data Requirements\nDescription (DRD) 1406OP-032, \xe2\x80\x9cElement Logistics Support Data\xe2\x80\x9d, Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL, 2013.\n6\nNASA Ground Operations Integrated Product Team, Logistics Integration Team, \xe2\x80\x9cAres 1-X Logistics Lessons Learned\xe2\x80\x9d,\nKennedy Space Center, FL, 2012.\n\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n'
