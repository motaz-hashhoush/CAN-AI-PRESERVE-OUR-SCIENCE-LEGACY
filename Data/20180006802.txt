Davis,* Jae-ik Park,\xe2\x80\xa0 Sujin Choi,\xe2\x80\xa1 Ryan Whitley,\xc2\xa7 John Carrico,**\nDong-Young Rew,\xe2\x80\xa0\xe2\x80\xa0 and Seok-Weon Choi\xe2\x80\xa1\xe2\x80\xa1\nThis paper proposes an enhanced control technique for stationkeeping maneuvers to reduce \xce\x94v costs for the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO). A\nscheduled circularization control technique exploits patterns in the evolution of\nthe line of apsides and eccentricity to achieve a significant reduction in stationkeeping \xce\x94v costs based on spacecraft requirements. The technique is compared\nagainst previous algorithms implemented for maneuver operations of the Lunar\nProspector and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) missions in the USA and\nKAGUYA in Japan. Through Monte Carlo analysis, the efficacy and robustness\nof the proposed method are verified, and the technique is shown to meet the operational requirements of KPLO.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO) is a lunar exploration spacecraft developed by the Korea\nAerospace Research Institute (KARI). Planned for launch late in 2020, KPLO will spend a year in a 100\nkm circular polar science orbit around the Moon. South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s first mission beyond Earth orbit, KPLO\xe2\x80\x99s\npurpose is to implement and verify new space technology, for example, core technology for lunar exploration, scientific research on the lunar environment, and space internet technology.\nAfter launch on a commercial launch vehicle, KPLO will execute a month-long transfer to the Moon\nthat includes 3.5 phasing loops.1 Lunar orbit insertion will be accomplished by a series of LOI maneuvers\nthat lower the spacecraft into a 100 km circular orbit. A month-long commissioning phase will be followed\nby at least 11 months of science operations at the Moon. Gravitational perturbations by the lunar gravity\nfield as well as the Earth and Sun will increase orbit eccentricity and eventually lead to impact with the\nsurface of the Moon, so an effective but low-cost stationkeeping scheme is required.\nPast missions to circular, polar lunar orbits have effectively implemented orbit maintenance algorithms\nto maintain spacecraft within eccentricity or altitude requirements.

The current investigation modifies this algorithm for the KPLO orbit,\ndeveloping a scheduled circularization control scheme with the goal of decreasing the \xce\x94v required for orbit\nmaintenance.\nMISSION DESCRIPTION\nThe KPLO spacecraft will carry six scientific payloads. These include the LUnar Terrain Imager\n(LUTI), designed to map the surface, seek future landing sites, and identify locations of interest on the lunar surface; as well as the Wide Field Polarimetric Camera (PolCam), which will perform a polarimetric\nimaging survey of the entire lunar surface in three spectral bands. It will carry the KPLO Gamma Ray\nSpectrometer (KGRS), designed to map the distribution of various elements and radiation on and beneath\nthe lunar surface; the KPLO Magnetometer (KMAG), which will characterize lunar magnetic anomalies\nand investigate the origin of lunar crustal magnetism; and the Disruption Tolerant Networking experiment\npayload (DTN). Additionally, a NASA payload will be carried by KPLO, Shadowcam, designed to explore\npermanently shadowed regions in craters at the poles.\nThe onboard communication device on KPLO will transmit status reports and scientific data and receive\ncommands in both S- and X- bands. A set of four 30 N thrusters using mono-propellant will control the\ntrajectory of this orbiter, including translunar injection (TLI), lunar orbit insertion (LOI), and stationkeeping maneuvers. Attitude will be maintained with 3-axis control through its reaction wheels as well as a\nset of four 5 N thrusters. Figure 1 shows the KPLO configuration and payloads.\nKMAG\n\nDTNPL\n+Xsc\n\nShadowCam\n\nPolCam\nKGRS\nLUTI\n\n+Ysc\n\n+Zsc\n\nFigure 1. KPLO Configuration and Payloads\nThe KPLO spacecraft is planned to launch on a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as early\nas December 2020. After launch, the spacecraft will execute a series of three apogee raise maneuvers, approaching the moon after a cruise of approximately a month in three phasing loops. At the Moon, a series\nof three lunar orbit insertion maneuvers will lower the spacecraft into its circular science orbit. The transfer\ntrajectory appears in Figure 2; further details appear in Choi et al.1\nThe KPLO science orbit is nominally at an altitude of 100 km. Excursions from the nominal are desired\nto remain less than 30 km, though occasional small violations of the \xc2\xb130 km deadband for short durations\nare deemed acceptable. The preferred inclination is precisely 90\xe2\x81\xb0 to provide visibility of shadowed craters\nat the poles. Gravitational perturbations cause the inclination to drift over time, with the magnitude and\ndirection of the drift depending on insertion epoch. Insertion inclination is adjusted to maximize duration of\nthe science operations at 90\xe2\x81\xb0 inclination. The stationkeeping \xce\x94v budget is 75 m/s for the year-long mission.\n\n2\n\nIn the current analysis, a 75x75 a 75x75 GRAIL0660B lunar gravitational field model is used, and third\nbody effects for the Sun and Earth are considered. Solar radiation pressure (SRP) is also considered in portions of the study.\n\nFigure 2. Transfer orbit from launch to science orbit insertion. Earth-centered inertial view (a),\nEarth-Moon Rotating View (b) and Moon centered inertial view (c).\nEVOLUTION OF ECCENTRICITY AND LINE OF APSIDES\nWithout orbit maintenance, a spacecraft inserted into a circular polar orbit with an altitude of 100 km\nwill impact the lunar surface after about 200 days. Gravitational perturbations from the lunar gravity field,\nas well as third body effects from the Earth and Sun, cause the eccentricity of the orbit to generally increase\nover time until impact occurs. The evolution of the orbital elements is not random, however. In particular,\nthe evolution of the line of apsides and eccentricity (e) of a polar orbit at the Moon follows distinct patterns,2-8 and these patterns are employed to design effective algorithms for orbit control. A sample pattern\nappears in a polar plot in Figure 3a, with eccentricity along the radius and argument of perilune (\xcf\x89) as the\nangular value. With an eccentricity at orbit insertion of e = 0.018 and argument of perilune \xcf\x89 = 217\xe2\x81\xb0, the\norbit starts just outside the deadband at an altitude of 133 km at the marked insertion state. The eccentricity\ndecreases in a repeating e-\xcf\x89 pattern, moving clockwise and to the right in Figure 3a, until the orbit is nearly\ncircular. The eccentricity then begins to grow again, continuing to evolve in the same e-\xcf\x89 pattern, until the\norbit departs the \xc2\xb130 km deadband and eventually impacts the lunar surface after 236 days. The altitude\nover time of the same propagation appears in Figure 3b, with \xc2\xb130 km deadbands marked in green. The\nsame behavior (decreasing, then increasing eccentricity) is seen in the altitude pattern, until the spacecraft\nimpacts at an altitude of 0 km.\nInstead of allowing the orbit to freely evolve until impact, orbit maintenance maneuvers (OMM) are\nimplemented to exploit the patterns in eccentricity and argument of perilune to control the spacecraft and\nkeep it in orbit and within given altitude deadbands throughout the operational period. A pair of maneuvers\nallow the spacecraft to jump from one location on the e-\xcf\x89 polar plot to another. In general, the longer the\ndistance along the plot the spacecraft must travel, the more costly the maneuver.\nPatterns of evolution in the e-\xcf\x89 polar plot have been exploited in the past to successfully maintain LP, 2-3\nKaguya,4 and LRO.5-8 These three missions all employed a line-of-apsides control method that targets a\nspecific e-\xcf\x89 pair. The OMMs occur at regular intervals, as the patterns in the e-\xcf\x89 evolution repeat on a\nmonthly basis. LRO flew at an altitude of 50 km with a \xc2\xb120 km deadband during its primary science operations, and it executed a pair of maneuvers once per lunar month, about every 27.4 days. Maneuvers were\nscheduled when the right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) of the orbit was approximately 270\xe2\x81\xb0.\nThis constraint ensured that both maneuvers in the pair were visible from Earth. A sample of the e-\xcf\x89 evolution followed by a trajectory similar to the one flown by LRO appears in Figure 4a. Note the repeating pattern. Insertion occurs at the blue point to the left of the plot, with initial conditions a = 1787 km, e =\n0.0075, \xcf\x89 = 160\xe2\x81\xb0, i = 90\xe2\x81\xb0, and RAAN = 270\xe2\x81\xb0. The trajectory evolves over time in the direction of the blue\narrows. The first burn in the OMM pair occurs at the red point on the righthand side; the eccentricity and\nRAAN have approximately returned to their original values, but the argument of perilune is about 20\xe2\x81\xb0. The\nfirst burn in the pair, occurring at a true anomaly of about 150\xe2\x81\xb0, targets an intermediate orbit with an argu-\n\n3\n\nment of perilune of about 90\xe2\x81\xb0 at apolune on a transfer arc. The second burn (also in red) then targets back\nto the original values of a, e, and \xcf\x89 at the next perilune. To remain within the \xc2\xb120 km deadband, a monthly\nmaneuver set is necessary. Figure 4a represents 13 maneuver pairs, a propagation time of 380 days, and a\ntotal maneuver cost of 141 m/s. The average of 10.8 m/s per maneuver pair is in line with the observed average of 11.1 m/s for each of the first 6 maneuver pairs of LRO science operations, as reported by Mesarch\net al.5\n\nFigure 3. Evolution of argument of perilune and eccentricity over time (blue) for an uncontrolled\nspacecraft in an e-\xcf\x89 polar plot (a). Approximate eccentricity corresponding to a 30 km deadband\nmarked in green, impact in red. Altitude vs. time for the same insertion conditions (b).\nLP and Kaguya each flew in a higher 100 km orbit, similar to the one planned for KPLO. With a \xc2\xb120\nkm deadband requirement, LP performed maneuvers about every 55 days using a line-of-apsides control\nscheme. Kaguya, with a \xc2\xb130 km requirement,4 implemented a similar scheme. An e-\xcf\x89 history for a trajectory similar to LP\xe2\x80\x99s selected orbit appears in Figure 4b. The insertion state, corresponding to a = 1837 km, e\n= 0.0095, \xcf\x89 = 160\xe2\x81\xb0, and RAAN = 270\xe2\x81\xb0 is marked by a blue point at the left. After the trajectory evolves\nover about 54.6 days, the RAAN and eccentricity return to their starting values and the argument of perilune has a value of about 20\xe2\x81\xb0. As before, a pair of OMMs targets first to \xcf\x89 = 90\xe2\x81\xb0 at apolune on a transfer\narc, and then back to the starting conditions in a, e and \xcf\x89. With the higher 100 km nominal altitude, a maneuver pair is executed every two months. Figure 4b represents 6 maneuver pairs over 382 days for a total\n\xce\x94v of 83.7 m/s, or an average of 14 m/s per OMM pair. This cost corresponds to the average maneuver pair\ncost of 13.2 m/s observed during the Kaguya mission as reported by Matsumoto et al.4 Unsurprisingly,\nmaintaining the higher 100 km orbit within a 20 km deadband has a lower annual cost than maintaining the\n50 km orbit within 20 km of its nominal altitude.\nKaguya flew in a 100 km polar orbit with a larger altitude deadband requirement of \xc2\xb130 km. The larger\ndeadband allows a longer time span between maneuver pairs, if desired. Consider the e-\xcf\x89 plot in Figure 4c.\nIn this example, the spacecraft is inserted with a = 1837 km, e = 0.0135, \xcf\x89 = 170\xe2\x81\xb0, and RAAN = 270\xe2\x81\xb0. After three lunar months, or about 82 days, the orbit returns to the original insertion values of eccentricity and\nRAAN, and the argument of perilune has a value of about 15\xe2\x81\xb0. A pair of maneuvers again targets to \xcf\x89 = 90\xe2\x81\xb0\nalong a transfer arc, and finally back to insertion values of a, e, and \xcf\x89. Only 4 maneuver pairs are executed\nduring the 382-day propagation, but each OMM pair is larger, with an average value of 21.8 m/s. The maneuver pair must move the orbit farther across the e-\xcf\x89 plot, corresponding to the higher cost of each OMM\npair. The total annual \xce\x94v in this case is 87.2 m/s. Though the deadbands are higher than in the example in\nFigure 4b, the cost is not lower; in fact, the annual \xce\x94v is nearly 4 m/s higher.\nIt is possible to increase the deadbands to \xc2\xb140 km by inserting with a higher eccentricity farther left on\nthe polar plot and allowing the e-\xcf\x89 pattern to evolve for four months. An example appears in Figure 4d,\nwith insertion values a = 1837 km, e = 0.017, \xcf\x89 = 180\xe2\x81\xb0, and RAAN = 270\xe2\x81\xb0. Executing a burn pair every 4\n\n4\n\nmonths results in still larger distances to cross along the e-\xcf\x89 plot, thus increasing the cost of each OMM\npair to 30.5 m/s on average. The total stationkeeping cost of the three OMM pairs grows to 91.5 m/s. The\ncurrent investigation explores a method to decrease the distance traveled along the e-\xcf\x89 plot, and hence the\ntotal annual stationkeeping \xce\x94v.\n\nFigure 4. Evolution of argument of perilune and eccentricity over time for circular polar lunar orbits\nwith line-of-apsides control. 50 km \xc2\xb120 km (a), 100 km \xc2\xb1 20 km (b), 100 km \xc2\xb1 30 km (c), and 100 km\n\xc2\xb1 40 km orbits (d).\n\nSCHEDULED CIRCULARIZATION CONTROL\nThe polar plots in Figure 4 demonstrate the application of line-of-apsides control to effectively maintain circular lunar orbits by exploiting repeating patterns in eccentricity and argument of perilune. As the\ndeadbands grow in Figures 4b, 4c, and 4d, the distances between the red points (representing OMMs) also\nincrease. That is, the larger the deadband, the longer the distance within the e-\xcf\x89 plot that each OMM pair\nmust traverse. The OMM magnitude increases as well. To reduce the total stationkeeping \xce\x94v, the line-ofapsides control algorithm is modified to reduce the distance along the e-\xcf\x89 plot traversed after each OMM\npair.\nThe insertion state is selected such that the trajectory evolution begins at the far left of the e-\xcf\x89 plot. The\norbit is allowed to evolve for three or more months before the first OMM pair is executed. Instead of targeting back to the insertion values of eccentricity and argument of perilune, however, a Hohman transfer is\nexecuted to circularize the orbit. This alternate OMM pair moves the orbit to the center of the e-\xcf\x89 plot,\nwhere a new pattern is initiated. The trajectory is allowed to evolve for two months between each subse-\n\n5\n\nquent OMM pair, each of which re-circularizes the orbit. As in the line-of-apsides control scheme, the\nburns are executed at RAAN = 270\xe2\x81\xb0, ensuring both maneuvers in the pair are visible from Earth. Two samples are explored, one with a starting RAAN = 50\xe2\x81\xb0, one with an insertion RAAN = 230\xe2\x81\xb0. These two orbit\noptions represent favorable insertion conditions from the Earth-to-Moon transfer.1 Initial conditions for the\ntwo orbits appear in Table 1.\nTable 1.

Orbit insertion is marked by a blue point on the lower left\nof the e-\xcf\x89 plot in Figure 5a. The orbit is allowed to drift through e-\xcf\x89 space for 3.5 maneuver-free months at\nthe start of the mission without violating deadbands. The first set of OMMs is then executed when RAAN\nreaches a value of 270\xe2\x81\xb0, marked by red points in Figure 4a. This OMM pair targets a 100 km circular orbit.\nBecause the insertion state is carefully selected such that the OMM location in e-\xcf\x89 space is near \xcf\x89 = 0, the\nOMM traverses a very short distance within the e-\xcf\x89 plot, and the corresponding \xce\x94v magnitude is just 7.1\nm/s. The spacecraft is then propagated for 2 lunar months, and a second burn pair (marked in orange) targets back to altitude = 100 km and eccentricity = 0. This 2-month pattern is repeated, with a Hohman transfer circularizing the orbit at each OM opportunity. The subsequent four burn pairs average 12.7 m/s each,\nfor a total annual stationkeeping cost of 58.0 m/s. The cumulative \xce\x94v magnitude over time appears in Figure 5b. This cost represents a savings of 25.7 m/s over line-of-apsides control for the first year in the 100\nkm circular polar orbit. Since the algorithm circularizes the orbit at regular intervals, it is denoted scheduled circularization control (SCC).\nThe cost savings achieved using SCC requires a tradeoff. The line-of-apsides control method maintains\nthe spacecraft within \xc2\xb120 km of the nominal 100 km altitude, and as demonstrated, increasing the deadbands to 30 km or even 40 km does not decrease the cost. In the SCC method, however, cost savings are\nachieved by relaxing the deadband. The spacecraft altitude history appears in Figure 5c. Green lines mark\n\xc2\xb130 km deadbands, and the OMM pairs are marked by red and orange points. Every 2 months, the orbit\nviolates the 30 km limit for about 3 days. The maximum and minimum altitudes reached in this example\nare 134 km and 65 km respectively, each occurring shortly after insertion during the first month of operations. The average altitude over the year is 100 km, and the altitude returns to 100 km at each OMM burn\nas the eccentricity is targeted to zero.\nThe inclination at orbit insertion affects the OM cost. The starting inclination in the RAAN = 50\xe2\x81\xb0 example, i = 89.45\xe2\x81\xb0, is selected to ensure that the spacecraft achieves 90\xe2\x81\xb0 inclination throughout the first year of\noperations, and to continue the 90\xe2\x81\xb0 inclination passages through a possible extended mission. The secular\ntrend in inclination for the RAAN = 50\xe2\x81\xb0 orbit with a Jan 1, 2021 insertion is positive, so the starting inclination is selected below the nominal 90\xe2\x81\xb0. The inclination history appears in Figure 5d.\n\n6\n\nFigure 5. SCC algorithm controls the RAAN = 50\xe2\x81\xb0 orbit for one year. Polar e-\xcf\x89 plot (a).\nCumulative \xce\x94v history (b). Altitude history (c). Inclination history (d).\nA second example represents an insertion on the other side of the Moon. With a starting RAAN = 230\xe2\x81\xb0,\nthe initial value of \xcf\x89 is selected such that the argument of perilune evolves through the southern hemisphere, as in Figure 6a. After nearly three lunar months, the orbit reaches RAAN = 270\xe2\x81\xb0 and the first OMM\npair is executed. At this point, marked in red in Figure 6a, the eccentricity is relatively low and \xcf\x89 is near\nzero. As a result, to reach the center of the e-\xcf\x89 polar plot, the OMM pair traverses only a short distance in\ne-\xcf\x89 space, and the required \xce\x94v to circularize the orbit is only 6.0 m/s. As depicted in Figure 6b, the subsequent maneuvers occur every 2 lunar months, always when RAAN = 270\xe2\x81\xb0 for visibility from Earth. The\nnext four maneuver pairs average 12.4 m/s each, and the total stationkeeping cost for the first year is 55.7\nm/s.\nThe altitude profile appearing in Figure 6c shows, again, small excursions beyond 130 km and 70 km\naltitude for about 3 days every two months. The starting inclination, depicted in Figure 6d, is selected to be\ngreater than 90\xe2\x81\xb0 to compensate for the negative secular trend in inclination for an insertion date of Jan 1,\n2021.\nThe RAAN = 230\xe2\x81\xb0 sample orbit is extended for two years to simulate an extended mission and to assess\nthe cost savings vs. line of apsides control over a longer time frame. In a two-year simulation, the first\nOMM pair occurs after 3 lunar months, and the subsequent 11 OMM pairs occur every 2 lunar months.\nThe tight pattern in e-\xcf\x89 space is maintained, and the total \xce\x94v for two years of stationkeeping is 141.6 m/s.\nIn comparison, a 2-year propagation of the orbit featured in Figure 4b using line-of-apsides control with\nmaneuvers every 2 lunar months costs 180.3 m/s. The two altitude profiles and e-\xcf\x89 polar plots appear in\nFigure 7. The inclination of both orbits passes through 90\xe2\x81\xb0 throughout the entire two-year period. Over the\ntwo-year mission, the SCC algorithm saves about 40 m/s over line-of-apsides control for a 100 km circular\npolar orbit if a wider deadband is acceptable.\nBoth the RAAN = 50\xe2\x81\xb0 sample orbit and the RAAN = 230\xe2\x81\xb0 sample orbit are integrated with the Earth to\nMoon transfer trajectory optimization (see Figure 0) to ensure that the insertion conditions are compatible\nwith the transfer trajectory. In both cases, insertion into the favorable orbits is achieved with negligible\nchanges to the total transfer cost as compared to insertion into a circular polar orbit with RAAN and \xcf\x89 left\nfree to vary. That is, specifying particular insertion conditions to ensure favorable stationkeeping costs does\nnot adversely affect the total cost of the integrated mission.\n\n7\n\nFigure 6.

The two example orbits in Table 1\nare considered for insertion epochs daily between January and December 2021. Results for the RAAN =\n50\xe2\x81\xb0 case appear in Figure 8. For every day in 2021, a spacecraft is inserted into orbit at Moon with the orbital elements listed in Table 1. Each insertion state is then propagated forward for a year to assess annual\nstationkeeping costs, minimum and maximum altitudes, and the range of inclination values over the year.\nAnnual stationkeeping costs as a function of insertion date appear in Figure 8a. Costs are characterized\nby a short period repeating every month as well as a negative secular trend, but variations are small. The\nmaximum cost of 58 m/s occurs with insertion at the beginning of January, and the minimum annual cost of\n55.6 m/s is achieved with orbit insertion in mid-December.\nVariations in the minimum and maximum altitudes experienced by the spacecraft are also small; results\nappear in Figures 8b and d. For insertion dates at the beginning of the year, the altitudes tend to remain\nhigher with larger values for both maximum and minimum altitude during a one-year mission. If the\nspacecraft inserts later in the year, the minimum altitude it experiences will likely be lower, as will the\nmaximum altitude during the mission. Again, a four-week period is apparent in the data.\nVariations in minimum and maximum inclination values over a year-long mission appear in Figure 8c\nfor insertion dates throughout 2021. For example, a spacecraft inserting on Jan 1, 2021 experiences a minimum inclination of 89.4\xe2\x81\xb0 and a maximum inclination of 91\xe2\x81\xb0 during its year-long mission, while the same\ninsertion state on Jan 7, 2021 corresponds to a minimum inclination of 88.7\xe2\x81\xb0 and a maximum inclination of\n90.5\xe2\x81\xb0 during a year\xe2\x80\x99s science operations. The pattern in inclination trends repeats every lunar month without a secular trend. That is, for a given set of insertion elements, the insertion date determines whether the\ninclination increases during the year-long mission or if the inclination decreases through the year. By customizing insertion inclination based on insertion date, i = 90\xe2\x81\xb0 passages are maintained throughout one year\n(or longer) science operations phases regardless of insertion date. Preferred values of inclination at insertion are explored further in the following section.\n\nFigure 8. Variations in cost (a), maximum and minimum altitudes (b,d), and maximum and minimum inclinations (c) for year-long science operations as a function of insertion epoch in 2021 for\nRAAN = 50\xe2\x81\xb0 insertion conditions from Table 1\nSimilarly, variations in behavior of cost, altitude, and inclination based on insertion date for the RAAN\n= 230\xe2\x81\xb0 set of insertion elements from Table 1 appear in Figure 9. Again, the maximum costs are associated\n\n9\n\nwith insertion dates at the beginning of the year, with a four-week pattern throughout the year. Altitudes\nalso vary with a monthly period, with the largest maximum altitudes corresponding to the largest minimum\naltitudes, so that the total altitude range (minimum to maximum) for any given insertion epoch does not\nvary widely. The inclination variations again follow a four-week period without a secular trend, but where\nthe RAAN = 50\xe2\x81\xb0 orbit starts the year with a positive slope in inclination, the RAAN = 230\xe2\x81\xb0 orbit has a\nnegative slope in inclination with a Jan 1, 2021 insertion date. That is, the two sets of insertion conditions\nare out of phase in inclination trends.\n\nFigure 9. Variations in cost (a), altitude (b), and inclination (c) for year-long science operations as a\nfunction of insertion epoch in 2021 for RAAN = 230\xe2\x81\xb0 insertion conditions from Table 1\n\nInclination Trends\nThe trends in inclination are significant due to the requirement to pass through i = 90\xe2\x81\xb0 during science\noperations. With no secular trend, the patterns in inclination evolution repeat each lunar month. A zoomed\nview of the first month of the plot from Figure 8c appears in Figure 10a. This view displays the inclination\nrange over a 1-year science mission as a function of insertion date for the RAAN = 50\xe2\x81\xb0 sample orbit from\nTable 1. Insertion occurs each day during the month of January 2021. For example, consider the first datapoint corresponding to insertion on Jan 1, 2021. The inclination evolution appears in Figure 10b. Note the\npositive secular trend as inclination evolves over the year; the starting inclination is thus selected to be lower than 90\xe2\x81\xb0 to enable polar passes throughout the year of operations and into a potential extended mission.\nThe inclination at insertion is 89.45\xe2\x81\xb0, and the resulting science orbit is propagated for a year with SCC orbit\nmaintenance. Over the course of a year propagation, osculating inclination ranges from a minimum of 89.1\xe2\x81\xb0\nat the start of science operations to a maximum of 90.7\xe2\x81\xb0 at the end of the year\xe2\x80\x99s operations. A second sample orbit commences on Jan 7, 2021, with initial orbital elements listed in Table 1. This initial state yields\nan orbit with no significant secular trend in inclination, as in Figure 10c. The inclination of this science\norbit remains in a fixed range for extended propagation times. The starting inclination is thus increased to\n89.75\xe2\x81\xb0 to center the inclination pattern on 90\xe2\x81\xb0. A third sample appears in Figure 10d. An insertion date of\nJan 15, 2021 yields a decreasing trend in inclination. A higher starting inclination is thus desirable; with i 0\n= 90.2\xe2\x81\xb0, the spacecraft makes polar passes throughout the year and is positioned for an extended mission. In\nsummary, initial inclination values for the RAAN = 50\xe2\x81\xb0 sample orbit range from about 89.45\xe2\x81\xb0 to about 90.2\xe2\x81\xb0\nwhen accounting for the secular trends. Adjusting the value of starting inclination based on insertion epoch\nallows for polar passages throughout the year to ensure favorable conditions for science operations.\n\n10\n\nFigure 10. Inclination range over a one-year science mission vs. insertion epoch for January 2021\ninsertion dates (a). Insertion inclination selected for 90\xe2\x81\xb0 science operations for insertion on Jan 1,\n2021 (b), Jan 7, 2021 (c), Jan 25, 2021 (d). RAAN = 50\xe2\x81\xb0 sample orbit.\nSimilar patterns exist in the inclination trends for the RAAN = 230\xe2\x81\xb0 sample orbit. Inclination ranges for\ninsertion dates in January 2021 appear in Figure 11a. In contrast to the previous example however, osculating inclination decreases over the course of the year for an orbit with insertion date of Jan 1, 2021. To account for the negative slope, the starting value of inclination is selected to be 90.28\xe2\x81\xb0. This initial inclination\nleads to coverage of i = 90\xe2\x81\xb0 throughout the year of science operations and into a potential second year, as in\nFigure 11b. Insertion a week later on Jan 7, 2021 results in a near-constant pattern in the osculating inclination. A starting value i0 = 89.85\xe2\x81\xb0 thus maintains inclination covering 90\xe2\x81\xb0 throughout the mission, as demonstrated in Figure 11c. Finally, an insertion epoch of Jan 15, 2021 corresponds to a positive slope in inclination during science operations, and an initial inclination of 89.5\xe2\x81\xb0 is selected to achieve the desired polar\norbit throughout the year, shown in Figure 11d.\n\nFigure 11.

RAAN = 230\xe2\x81\xb0 sample orbit.\n\n11\n\nAligning Solar \xce\xb2 Angle with Lunar Solstice\nFor optimal lighting in certain shadowed polar craters, it is desired for the science orbit to reach a solar\n\xce\xb2 angle equal to zero during the lunar solstice. The solar \xce\xb2 angle is defined as the angle between the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s orbital plane and the Moon-Sun vector. Solar \xce\xb2 = 0\xe2\x81\xb0 when the orbit is aligned with the Sun and passes through noon and midnight as in Figure 12a, and \xce\xb2 = 90\xe2\x81\xb0 when the orbital plane is normal to the MoonSun vector, placing the orbit over twilight as in Figure 12b. The value of RAAN at insertion determines the\nstarting value of solar \xce\xb2 angle; after insertion, the angle evolves slowly through the year, reaching a value\nof 0\xe2\x81\xb0 every 6 months. For a given RAAN value, two launch opportunities per month align \xce\xb2 = 0\xe2\x81\xb0 with a\nsolstice; the two solstices occur on March 16, 2021 and August 28, 2021. The insertion epochs each month\nthat lead to the desired conjunction of solstice with \xce\xb2 = 0\xe2\x81\xb0 also correspond to the maximum inclination variations.\n\nFigure 12. The orbital plane is aligned with the Moon-Sun vector when \xce\xb2 = 0\xe2\x81\xb0 (a) and is perpendicular to the Moon-Sun vector when \xce\xb2 = 90\xe2\x81\xb0 (b). Insertion on Dec 31, 2020 at 20:00 aligns \xce\xb2 = 0\xe2\x81\xb0 with the\nsolstice.\nMONTE CARLO ANALYSIS\nThe stationkeeping costs and trends discussed thus far assume an ideal spacecraft. In reality, errors in\nnavigation and maneuver execution, as well as perturbations due to solar radiation pressure and momentum\ndesaturations, lead to variations in the cost. In the current analysis, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed\nto explore the robustness of the SCC algorithm and to compare costs with other methods of orbit maintenance. The following errors are considered:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInsertion error: 200 m position, 2 cm/s velocity, spherical 3\xcf\x83\nNavigation error: 200 m position, 2 cm/s velocity, spherical 3\xcf\x83\nManeuver execution error: 5% magnitude, 5% direction, 3\xcf\x83\nSolar radiation pressure: 5% area, 10% coefficient of reflectivity, 1\xcf\x83\nMomentum wheel desaturations, 1 per day, 1 cm/s, 1\xcf\x83 (Included in selected runs)\n\nThe purpose of the analysis is to assess the reliability or consistency of the SCC algorithm in a realistic\nscenario. That is, to assess whether the low cost and the repeatable patterns in the e-\xcf\x89 evolution remain in\nthe presence of spacecraft and navigation errors, and how the costs and reliability compare to other algorithms. First, a simulation is run to assess costs for the SCC algorithm for the RAAN = 50\xe2\x81\xb0 and RAAN =\n230\xe2\x81\xb0 sample orbits from Table 1. The analysis includes 100 Monte Carlo trials, each propagated for a year,\nwith a Jan 1, 2021 insertion date. The results appear in Table 2. The error-free values also appear in the\ntable. The difference between the minimum cost and the maximum cost for the year-long simulation is less\nthan 2 m/s and differs by less than 1.5 m/s as compared to the case without errors. That is, the SCC algorithm yields a consistent cost even in the presence navigation and spacecraft errors. The minimum and\nmaximum altitudes experienced by the spacecraft vary slightly, by up to 1 km, as compared to the nominal\ncase without errors. The pattern in the e-\xcf\x89 polar plot is maintained in each of the Monte Carlo trials.\n\n12\n\nTable 2.

The initial spacecraft state is adjusted separately for each algorithm; different starting elements are\nmore suitable for each. The first two methods explored are the SCC algorithm and the line-of-apsides control algorithm discussed previously. Simulations that include 50 Monte Carlo trials each propagated for a\nyear are run. Results appear in the first two rows of Table 3. Both algorithms provide consistent results that\ndo not vary significantly in the presence of errors. The line-of-apsides control algorithm yields a tighter\ndeadband, with no excursions beyond \xc2\xb120 km. The SCC algorithm provides a lower cost at the expense of\nlarger deadbands. Note that desaturations are only considered in the SCC analysis.\nThe second two algorithms are simple deadband control algorithms. Neither takes advantage of the repeatable patterns in e-\xcf\x89 evolution; a maneuver is simply executed when a deadband is violated. The first\ndeadband control algorithm performs a Hohmann transfer to circularize the orbit to 100 km altitude each\ntime the \xc2\xb130 km deadband is reached. The second method is a one-sided control method; a single burn is\nexecuted to correct only the deadband that is violated, either raising perilune to 100 km or lowering apolune to 100 km. A major disadvantage of the simple deadband control algorithms is that the maneuvers are\nnot scheduled in advance: they are unpredictable and unlikely to occur at RAAN = 90\xe2\x81\xb0 or RAAN = 270\xe2\x81\xb0,\nand thus are not necessarily visible from Earth. In addition, without following the repeatable e-\xcf\x89 pattern,\nthe number of maneuvers performed during the year of science operations, along with the associated cost,\nvaries widely as the characteristics of each trial are affected by navigation and spacecraft errors. In both\ncases, the no-errors cost is about the same as the minimum cost in the Monte Carlo run. However, the number of maneuvers and the maximum cost are significantly higher; in particular, the deadband control\nscheme that circularizes the orbit at each deadband violation (row 3 in Table 3) has a maximum cost more\nthan 25 m/s higher than the minimum. The lack of predictability in maneuver cost and frequency associated\nwith the deadband control algorithms make them less favorable for operations.\nTable 3.

Instead, the spacecraft is planned to impact the surface of the Moon naturally after science operations cease. Analysis is run to determine potential impact sites and to assess the likelihood of\ninterfering with historical lunar landing sites.\nThe starting conditions for the disposal analysis assume that KPLO has just completed its final stationkeeping maneuver pair to circularize the orbit to 100 km altitude after a year of science operations. The\ninitial altitude is thus assumed to be 100 km, with a zero eccentricity. The initial values of RAAN and argument of perilune are varied from 0 to 360\xe2\x81\xb0 in 30\xe2\x81\xb0 steps. Initial inclination ranges from 88\xe2\x81\xb0 to 92\xe2\x81\xb0 in 0.5\xe2\x81\xb0\nsteps, since the original orbit insertion conditions (orbital elements and epoch) determine the final value of\ninclination. The epoch for the final circularization maneuver (and thus the initial epoch for the disposal\nanalysis) is set at Jan 1, 2022. Each starting point is propagated until it impacts the surface of the Moon,\nwithout considering navigation, SRP, or maneuver execution errors; orbit divergence is due to the lunar\n\n13\n\ngravity field and Sun and Earth third-body effects only. Resulting impact points are plotted along with\nAmerican and Russian historical landing sites on a lunar map in Figure 13.\nThe predictable evolution of argument of perilune and eccentricity explain the clustering of impact\npoints in the southern hemisphere. Recall the pattern appearing in the e-\xcf\x89 polar plot in Figure 3a as a\nspacecraft in a 100 km polar orbit is propagated to impact. At an eccentricity corresponding to a zero altitude, the argument of perilune is approximately 320\xe2\x81\xb0. In a polar orbit, this value of \xcf\x89 corresponds to a latitude of about -40\xe2\x81\xb0. Each of the starting conditions considered in the impact analysis follows a similar pattern to that appearing in Figure 3a. Thus, all of the potential impact sites are clustered near -40\xe2\x81\xb0 latitude.\nThe historical landing sites, marked in red in Figure 13, do not extend far into the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s southern hemisphere. Thus, an uncontrolled impact of KPLO will not risk disturbing these historical sites.\n\nFigure 13. Potential KPLO impact sites and historic landing sites\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe KPLO spacecraft is scheduled to launch in late 2020 for insertion into a 100 km, circular, polar science orbit in 2021. A low cost, reliable stationkeeping method is proposed to maintain the spacecraft within\naltitude deadbands for a year-long science mission. Scheduled circularization control exploits patterns in\nthe evolution of argument of perilune and eccentricity to schedule maneuvers that are small in magnitude,\nregularly scheduled, predictable in cost, and visible from Earth. The results are confirmed in Monte Carlo\nanalysis. The SCC method saves significant \xce\x94v over a line-of-apsides control scheme similar to that used\nfor operations of Lunar Prospector, Kaguya, and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. However, the cost savings\nare achieved by allowing short excursions beyond a \xc2\xb130 km deadband every other month. Additionally, an\nassessment of spacecraft disposal by uncontrolled impact is performed, demonstrating that impacts occur in\nthe southern hemisphere and do not threaten historical landing sites.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Michael Mesarch and David Folta for their insight.
