Consultant Robert Price, operating at E.S.I, Inc. in Albany, NY, sought help from NERAC to develop an automated tool for deburring the inside of 8 inch breech ring assemblies for howitzers produced by Watervliet Arsenal. NERAC conducted a search of the NASA data base and six others. From information supplied, Price designed a system consisting of a standard industrial robot arm, with a specially engineered six-axis deburring tool fitted to it. A microcomputer and computer program direct the tool on its path through the breech ring. E.S.I. markets the system to aerospace and metal cutting industries for deburring, drilling, routing and refining machined parts.", "title": "Robotic System", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T22:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020091942, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020091942, "id": "ff0d30f38d6d44c2aa9f758e75538f27", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1984", "publicationDate": "1984-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020091942.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020091942/downloads/20020091942.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020091942/downloads/20020091942.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020091942/downloads/20020091942.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
