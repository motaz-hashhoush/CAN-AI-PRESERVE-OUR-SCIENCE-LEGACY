A Technology Utilization House (Tech House) based on this design was constructed at the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The Tech House is instrumented so that the performance of the design features and energy systems can be evaluated during a planned family live-in period. As such, the house is both a demonstration unit and a research laboratory. The Tech House is to demonstrate the kind of single-family residence that will probably be available within the next five years.", "title": "NASA Tech House:  An early evaluation", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-03T20:27:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Technical Memorandum (TM)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19790025400, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790025400, "id": "53b1f96ae4e34a779697a243f12fe3ee", "publicationDate": "1977-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790025400.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790025400/downloads/19790025400.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790025400/downloads/19790025400.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790025400/downloads/19790025400.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
