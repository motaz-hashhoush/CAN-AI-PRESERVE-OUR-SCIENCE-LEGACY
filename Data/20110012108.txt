In order to achieve\ncustomer satisfaction, companies tend to accept\ncustomer orders regardless of time and location\nconstraints. Such acceptance of short lead time\norders (Le. rush orders) often causes many problems\nin managing supply chain network due to the\noperating priorities they take at the expense of\nregular orders. This situation results unbalance usage\nof system resources (i.e. consume more resources to\ndeliver the rush order) which make companies face\nmany troubles in delivering their regular orders at the\nrequired time and quality [15] . The equilibrium of both\ntypes of orders is a true challenge that every supply\nchain has to deal with. Arising from the\naforementioned issues and the willingness to apply\nstrategies that can reduce risks, this study aims to\nassess the impact of rush orders risk on supply chain\nperformance and investigate different mitigation\nstrategies that can decrease its influence.\nThe management of supply chain risks is an\ninevitable task for corporations that seek to achieve\nsubstantial cost reductions and enhance operational\nefficiency. Simulation modeling approach has been\nsuccessfully used in many applications as an\neffective analytical tool that it can be utilized to\nassess system performance and examine\nimprovement strategies. For example, simulation was\nused to question the workload in health care systems\n[14] , to schedule servers in semiconductor\nmanufacturing systems [1] and evaluate customer\nsegmentation in supply chain management [5]. These\nare few examples of many applications where\nsimulation was effectively employed in modeling\ncomplex systems and examining various strategies to\nfind the optimum solution. In the context of supply\nchain risk management, discrete-event simulation\nwas developed to assess and mitigate multi-echelon\nsupply chain disruption risks. Ref. [13] has illustrated\nthat inventory level has a significant effect on\ncustomer satisfaction in case of disruption\n\noccurrence. Vendor selection, as a main strategy for\nmitigating supply chain risks, was studied using\nsimulation analysis approach. A simulationoptimization model was employed to reduce\nanticipated costs, increase quality acceptance level\nand achieve on time delivery by applying different\nvendor selection strategies [16]. Another common\nsupply chain risk, transportation disruption , was\nmodeled using system dynamics simulation to\nevaluate its effect on supply chain performance (e.g .\ninventory level and customer order delivery) [17].\nResilience, defined as the ability of a supply chain to\nreduce probabilities of disruption occurrence and\nsystem recovery time, has been developed further by\napplying \xc2\xb7what-if" analysis methodology. Supply chain\nresilience to disruptions was also evaluated using\nsimulation modeling approach [6]. Strategic, demand,\nmarket, implementation and performance risks are\nfive risk categories that contain most of supply chain\nrisks [4]. Recent studies now focuses on demand risk\nand has been studied from different perspectives,\nsuch as demand uncertainty, demand fluctuations\nand demand for new product [3] and [10] . The impact\nof rush orders on supply chain has not been\nresearched extensively and has few if any published\nreports. As an important source of risk in current\noperation conditions, this study aims to assess the\nimpact of rush orders on order\'s cost and cycle time.\nThe developed simulation model will be used also to\nexamine risk mitigation strategies against rush\norders. FAB Company, a leading enterprise in office\nfurniture, tends to accept any customer orders\nregardless its type (regular or rush orders) aiming to\naccommodate as many customers as possible and\nmaintain their market share. FAB competes in a\nvolatile market; hence price and lead time are key\nareas that companies must deliver on effectively. In\nthe following sections, a brief introduction of the\nproblems facing FAB is described, followed by a\ndetailed explanation of the modeling process. Having\ndescribed the conceptual model first, the\ndevelopment of the simulation model followed by\nvalidation and verification process is than addressed.\n\n161\n\nFinally, results and areas of discussion are\npresented.\n\n2.0PROBLEM STATEMENT\nFAB supplies various products such as, staff desks,\nworkstations, chairs, doors , curtain walls, floors,\npartitions, ceiling, cladding and many more products\n(i.e. over 2000 products). Along with these products,\ncomplete furnishing solutions are offered including;\nbank sectors, entertainment facilities (i.e. cinemas),\ntourism buildings (i.e. hotels) and the health care\nsector (i.e. hospitals). The company is a typical\nexample of a multi-echelon complex supply chain\n(Fig. 1). Customer orders arrive in the form of\nindividual contracts; each contract usually contains\ndifferent product types with different quantities.\nContracts are dispatched to singular products and\nparts which are designed by the design office (i.e.\ndesign tier). After that, products and parts designs\nare sent to research and development (R&D) to\ncreate the Bill of Materials (BOMs). Both drawings\nand BOMs are passed to the planning for; ( 1)\nchecking the availability of in-stock raw materials , (2)\nissuing purchase orders for unavailable raw\nmaterials, (3) assigning factories \' schedule to allocate\nrequired work orders. Once raw materials are\navailable, manufacturing processes then start.\nDistribution centre staff then collects the final\nproducts from factories, which are packed and\nshipped to the end customer. The intense competition\nthat FAB faces in today\'s market in addition to its\ndesire to compete on a worldwide scale prompts\nthem to shape their supply chain in Engineer-ToOrder (ETO) structure and to accept both regular and\nrush orders. ETO structure usually increases the level\nof complexity in the relationship between the various\nentities of supply chain [7] . However it has to be used\nto create competitive leverage by producing\ncustomized products according to customer\nspecifications (based on customer site layout and\ncharacteristics). On the other hand, accepting rush\n\n--\n\n.:::;:;::-.:..\n\norders protects the company market share by\nmaintaining customer satisfaction which in turn\ncreates a wider niche and extra profit margins.\nNevertheless, rush orders might cause delay in\ndelivering regular orders as they have priority in using\navailable resources and raw materials. Given the\ncomplexity of FAB\'s supply chain and the large\nnumber of variables, entities and operations rules\nincluded, there is a great need to use an effective\nmethodology to support FAB decision makers.\nSimulation modeling is used as a powerful tcolthat\ncan handle such complexity and be used as an\nefficient risk assessment tool. FAB simulation models\nare developed with three different scenarios in order\nto assess rush order risk and to investigate different\nmitigation strategies to reduce risk\'s influence.\nAverage cycle times and costs are the two main\nperformance measures that are used in this study to\nachieve the following objectives:\n(1) Develop a simulation model for the FAB supply\nchain in order to model ETO complexity.\n(2) Use simulation models to assess the impact of\nrush orders on system performance.\n(3) Investigate new risk mitigation strategies against\nthe current strategies and select the best regarding to\nthe performance indicators.\n\n3.0RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\nThe research methodology encompasses various\nphases starting with adopting conceptual models ,\ndata collection, developing simulation models,\nvalidation and verification and ending with results\nanalYSis and discussion.\n\n3.1. Conceptual Mode l\nIntegration definition model (tOE F) family has been\nused to conceptually model the FAB supply chain .\nHierarchical structure of IDEF language allows users\n(e.g. strategic managers , operational engineers and\nsystem analyzers) to effectively understand the\nsequence and details of system\'s functions. IDEF\n\n- _ .....-;=:\'~.\n\nFigure 1 FAB Supply Chain structure\n\n162\n\nr~\'\n\nlanguage has different kinds of structures that can\nmodel systems with various purposes [12J. IDEFO\n(i.e. functional modeling) and IDEF3 (i.e. process\nmodeling) are most relative techniques for business\nprocess modeling task. The main difference between\nboth techniques is that IDEFO focuses more on how\nbusiness functions are defined , sequenced and\nconnected by their inputs and resources. On the\nother hand, IDEF3 is a more detailed modeling\napproach that represents the logical object\'s flow\nthrough system\'s processes [9]. In this study, IDEFO\nand IDEF3 are integrated in order to model the\ncomplexity of FAB supply chain. The macro-level is\nmodeled using IDEFO showing the functions within\nFAB, their inputs, outputs, controls and resources\n(Fig. 3). On the other hand, IDEF3 is used to model\nthe micro-level of FAB focusing on products flow and\nsystem\'s operational rules (Fig.4).\n\n, \'--\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFlincrion Name\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n,"-,\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n/.w.o".,..",.j\n\nFigure 2 Basic iDEFO construct\n\n3.2. Modeling Macro-level Using IDEFO\nAn activity block, which is the main unit of IDEFO,\ndescribes the main functions of FAB supply chain.\nInputs, outputs, mechanisms, and con trols are\nrepresented by horizontal and vertical arrows (Fig. 2),\nIn addition to input and output arrows, the\nmechanisms arrow shows resources that facilitate\nmodeled functions (e.g. labors, machines, computer\nsystems, etc ... ). Function control arrows (top ~rro,,:,)\ncan be company regulations, standards or legislation.\nDifferent kinds 01 orders are received by FAB\'s sales\nslafl. Some ollhese orders, like pro,lects and tenders,\nrequire a preparation 01 time plans and financial\noffers before issuing the contrac ts. The ordered\nproducts are classified into two main categories;\nStandard Products (products that were manufactured\nin the company before and all its details are\navailable) and Special Products (products with new\ndesigns and specifications and no data available for\nthem) , Standard Products go direclly to the planning\n\nprocess in order to supply required materials and 10\nissue factories \' work orders. On the other hand, an\nengineering process starts by joining sales, design\nand R&D slaff to design and identify Special\nProduct\'s BOM. A detailed BOM is passed to the\nplanning process again to supply required materials\nand issue work orders. After the production process,\nall products are collected according to their contract\nnumbers and then delivered and installed at customer\nsites. Figure 3 graphically shows the main sequence\nof FAB supply chain processes, their inputs, outputs,\nand resources.\n\n3.3. Modeling Micro-level Using IDEF3\nIn contrast to IDEFO, IDEF3 has tess strict syntax and\nsemantic rules. Integrating IDEFO and IDEF3 using\nthe hierarchical structure provides a detailed\nconceptual model for FAR For example, Fig.(4)\nshows that the design and development function (A2)\nwas split to more elaborated processes representing\nthe main flow of design& development function.\nIDEF3 acts as a bridge between general conceptual\nmodel 01 FAB and proposed simulation model. In\nsimulation model , processes blocks that are shown in\nIDEF3 model is considered as an activity blocks,\nwhereas branching points will be represented as\nrouting decisions.\n\n_.\n--\n\n--==..-\n\n\' -\n\nII\nFlour83 IDEFO model for FAB suoolv chain\n\n163\n\n-\n\n,-\n\n1\n..:=...1\nr\n\n1\'C-i\'""\'t-i7.\';=~l l-=-1 1\n\n_.\n--\n\nK =-r -,.-\n\n..\n\nH-";;-\n\nl\n\n--.\n-r-~t\'i-53~ , ~.....\n__ ,r - -- -=. il-=-II\n-\n\n---:re\'-"\n\n11-,-11\n\n~ -...:::""\n\n, l_,\n\n"\n\ni -=- ~\'-t ..\n\n!\n\n.:- . 11\n\n...\n\ni.0:;-= Ii 1\n-=-11\n\n".\n\n..- - -:.::-w\n..\n\n--::;:- "\'HI"::\'"\n\nFigure 41DEF3 m odel for FAB supply c hain\n\n4.0SIMUlATION MODEL\nConceptual models (Fig. 3 and 4) provide a clear\nunderstanding of the relationships between different\n\nsystem entities. They also show the resources that\nare required at each step. Discrete-event simulation\n\nwas employed to develop a detailed simulation model\nto mimic the process of FAB. Model assumptions are\n(I) no supplier disruptions are considered (ii) all\nreceived materials are accepted (no return of poor\nquality materials). The model was built and executed\n\nusing simulation software based on Java and XML\ntechnology which provides object-oriented\nhierarchical and event-driven simulation capabilities\nfor modeling larg&scale applications. It also utilizes\nbreakthrough activity-based modeling paradigms\n(e.g. real world activities such as assembly, batching,\nand branching). Many features in FAB are coded in\nthe simulated blocks to mimic the real life application\ncharacteristics.\nSystem entities are the objects (products) thai are\nmodified by resources (sales staff, design stall,\nsupplier staff, etc ... ). Resources are characterized by\ntheir availability, whereas the product entity is\ncharacterized by arrival time, procesSing time, and\nproduct characteristics. Logical entities make\ndecisions for creating, joining, splitting , buffering, and\nbranching product entities. The model contains 950\nblocks representing; queues, activities, and branching\npoints. The hierarchical feature has been used to\nmimic exactly the system flow. Two main layers are\ndeveloped; ( 1) the upper layer (i.e. macro JeveJ)\nwhich represents the main activities in FAB. Five\nmain activities cover all simulated processes contain ;\nsales and customer support, products design and\nengineering, resource planning and material\nmanagement, manufacturing, and finally the\nwarehouse and installation activity. These activities\ncontain 13 processes that are conceptually modeled\n\nb y IDEFO at Fig. (3) representing the core processes\nof FAB supply chain such as sales, contract issue,\ndeSign , engineering , material management, .. . , etc.\n(2) The lower layer (micro-level) illustrates the\nobjects\' flow of each process. IDEF3 was used to\ndevelop the conceptual model for this layer, where all\noperations rules are represented. An example of the\nlower layer modeling that illustrates inputs, outputs,\naod lilt! ft!lalior1slfi~ I.It!lwtteH SOUlt! UpJ,Jef level\nprocesses is shown in Fig . (5). For the model to\nreach its steady state condition, the warm-up was\n100 hours. Every simulation run represented a year\nof actual tim ing. In the experimental phase, the\naverage from 10 replications of average cycle time\nand average operations cos ts were used as the main\nperformance measures.\nTable 1 shows th e main input variables of FAB supply\nchain. Theoretical statistical distribution was utilized\nto represent the random patterns of input variables.\nThe analysis of demand data resulted in normal\ndistribution with a mean of 4 days and standard\ndeviation of 1 day. Consistent with what was reported\nby [2], selVice time was fitted to exponential\ndistribution since service time data are completely\nrandom. For production lime weibull distribution was\nused . Finally, due to the shortage of lead time data\nthat were supplied by FAB, gamma distribution was\nused, according to [8J.\n\n164\n\nTable 1: Model input variables\n\n" \' \' \' \' \'\' D.......\n\nh .. . to p, .. 0""\n\n~~~~~\'\xc2\xb7~\xc2\xb7~\'~\xc2\xb7~\xc2\xb7~\xc2\xb7~\xc2\xb7~~. ~"~;;~========:!r----~.;..~"t"~"~-~"~"~.;"~\nr\n\n---::,,C,, " ,,"\'~--i\n\' " " ",,",:,\n\nS\n.",.,\n\n",od."\n\nD.....\n\nP" ... . . ., I.

Model Validation and Verification\nIn an effort to make the decisions that are based on\nsimulation models more accurate, efficient methods\nof verification and validation (V&V) are needed.\nInaccurate simulation results always lead to wrong\ndecisions proposals and implementation, resulting in\nhigh costs that can be more than the total cost used\nfor the simulation study. Therefore, the correctness\nand suitability of simulation results are very imponant.\nDifferent methods are used in order to verify\nsimulation coding . Decomposition method (i.e. verify\nevery group of blocks) was used to insure that every\nblock functions as expected . A built-in simulation\ndebugger is also used to avoid any coding bugs. On\nthe other hand, validation process was considered as\nan integral process, which starts from input data\ncollection through conceptual and simula tion model\ndevelopment and ends at output data analysis. Out of\n10 V&V methods that have been mentioned in [11],\nthree validation methods have applied in three\nphases of this study; (1) data collection phase, (2)\nconceptual modeling phase and finally (3 ) simulation\nresults phase. Three main objectives were targeted in\nthe validation process of data collection phase; (1 ) no\nmeasurement errors in data collection process, (2)\ngenerated data have to match the pattern of historical\ndata and (3) attribute values are within specified\nrange. To achieve that, a detailed examination of\ndata documentation\'s quality and consistency was\ndone with the cooperation of FAB company staff. In\naddition , real data were compared with statistically\ngenerated data and results were approved by the IT\ndepartment. The conceptual model was validated\nbased on structured interviews with system managers\nand staff in order to be certain thai all specified\nprocesses, structures, system elements, inputs and\noutputs are considered correctly. The modeling team\nalso examined the accuracy and consistency of the\nconceptual model to the problem definition . After that,\nsystem performance indicators were revised with\ndecision makers in order to be sure that it fits model\nobjectives. Finally, two main approaches were used\nto validate the final simu lation results. The first is\n"Face validation"\' approach that was performed by\ninterviewing managers and manufacturing teams in\norder to validate simulation results. The second is\n\n"comparison lesf\', which is achieved by comparing\nthe model and system output under identical input\nconditions. The validation process has shown that\nthere is only 15% deviation between simulated and\nactual results.\n\n5.0 RISK ANAlSVIS\nIn this paper, risk analysis procedure con tains two\nmain phases. First, it focuses on assessing the\ninfluence of rush order risk on performance\nindicators. Second, risk mitigation strategies have\nbeen examined against curren t system configuration.\nThree simulation models were developed\nrepresenting three operating strategies of FAB supply\nchain ;\n( 1) First Strategy (no rush order strategy): represen ts\nthe current system configurations f or FAB Company.\nNo rush orders received, is the only assumption in\nthis strategy.\n(2) Second Strategy (mixed orders strategy);\nrepresents curren t system con figur ation for FAB\nCompany. Both regular and rush orders are expected\nin this strategy. The two orders\' types have the same\nroute through supply chain , however rush orders\nhave higher priori ty for using resources and raw\nmaterials over regular orders.\n(3) Third Strategy (independent production route\nstrategy) : represents risk mitigation strategy which\nsuggests a separate processing route for both rush\nand regular orders wi th dedicated resources for each\nof them . Ten simulation runs for no rush order and\nmixed orders strategies are illustrated at Table 2 and\n\n3.\n\n165\n\nTabte 2: Simulation results of no-ru sh ord er strategy\n\n,\n\nNo rush\norders\n\nslr.llegy\n\n"\n\n1 ;\n\nMixed\n\norders\nSlralcgy\n\nPerformance indicators were divided into two\n\nsections (regular and rush orders) . No results are\nreported for rush order\'s columns in table 2 as no\nrush orders were allowed in this strategy. For the no\nrush order strategy, average cycle lime of regular\norders was ranged between 25 10 3 1 days, whereas\naverage cost varies between \xc2\xa3 7300 and \xe2\x82\xac 8200 per\norder. Time and cos t figures of regular orders were\n\nincreased in the mixed orders strategy to record\naverage cycle time between 30 to 70 days and\naverage cost between \xe2\x82\xac 9000 and \xe2\x82\xac 11000 (Table 3).\nTable 4 shows the differences between the two\nstrategies and indicates an increasing in average\ncycle time and average cost by 35% and 25%\nrespectively in case of applying mixed orders\nTable 4: Differences 01 performance indicators In\naDDlvina Iirst and second strateav\n[JIlT....... bt,..-\xc2\xab. h\'\nS".

Inaccurate\ndelivery time with high prices for regular orders are\nthe results of rush orders risks under the current\nsystem configuration. In order to mitigate the\ninfluence of rush order\'s risk, a separate route\nstrategy (strategy 3) is applied at design , engineering,\nplanning, purchasing, production, and distribution\ncenters. The simulation model was developed for risk\nmitigation strategy and was investigated against\nmixed orders strategy. Table 5 recorded a reduction\nin regular order\'s delivery time and average cost\ncompared to mixed orders strategy (Table 3 ).\nDelivery time was alternated between 25 days to 34\ndays whereas average cost ranged between \xc2\xa37000\nand \xc2\xa39000. The separate route strategy achieved a\n37% reduction for regular order\'s delivery time and\nabout a 17% reduction in average cost (Table 6).\nResults improvement has been achieved by\nseparating the flow of rush and regular orders\'\ncausing a reduction in regular order\'s waiting time\nand cost. On the other hand, a reduction in rush\norder\'s cycle time and cost by 3% and 27% was\nnoticed in case of applying separate route strategy.\nApplying the separate processing route strategy did\nnot make a significant impact on rush orders\' average\ncycle time. while average cost was significantly\ninfluenced. This can be explained that rush orders in\nboth strategies did not stay in the processes\' buffers\nfor a long time. In the mixed order strategy, rush\norders were located in the head of all burters due to\nthe high priority they have over the regular orders.\nWhereas in separate processing route strategy,\norders are split into two processing flows causes a\ndecrease in resources\' utilization and hence declined\nthe time of waiting free resources.\nTublc 6: l)ilTcrcnccs of p.::rformancc indicators in apillying\nSL\'Cond and third strat... \xc2\xb7ies\n,1IIT......... bt\'_n\nSl ,,\'\'\'\'\' SInot<g1<>\nP, .-f_\n\n\'\'\'\'\'\nstrategy.

Due to severe competition in current\nmarkets. enterprises have no longer an option not to\nconsent rush orders, even with such inconvenient\noperating conditions that might include the\nrestructuring of supply chain strategy. This often\nleads to the adoption of complex structures such as\nEngineer-To-Order (ETO). Simulation modeling has\nproven to be an effective tool to handle systems\nfeaturing high levels of complexity with uncertainty.\nHence. simulation models were developed in order to\n\n166\n\n,\n\neffectively assess the impact of rush orders risks on\nsystem pertormance indicators (cycle time and total\ncost) . It was also used to invesligate risk mitigalion\nstrategy that can decrease the negative im pact of\nrush orders on FAS\'s supply chain pertormance.\nIDEFO and IDEF3 were integrated to develop a\ndetailed concep tual model of FAS\'s supply chain .\nIOEF language was used as it applies a standard\nformat with hierarchical slrucl ure that supports the\nmodeling of predecessors, relationships, interrelationship and interdependences of activities and\nobjects. Modeling has been structured into layers to\nbe able to present the processes and their activities\nas well as the overall system view. T hree methods of\nvalidation were applied for data collection phase,\nconceptual modeling phase and then simulation\nmodeling results.\nTo assess and mitigate the impact of ru sh orders risk,\nthis study focused on three strategies (i.e. no rush\norder strategy, m ixed orders strategy, and\nindependent route strategy). The simulation model\nprovides not only numerical m easures of system\npertormance, but also insights about the effect of\nrush orders on the delivery time and the cost of\nregular orders. Results showed that rush orders have\na negative impact on both cycle time and average\ncost of regular orders as they were increased by\n(35%) and (25%) respectively. The risk mitigation\nstrategy - dedicate a separate route for rush ordersminimized the impact of rush orders by decreasing\ncycle time by 37% and cost by 17% for regular orders\nand 3% and 27% for rush orders.\n\n7.0REFERENCES\n1- Arisha, A. and Young, P.
