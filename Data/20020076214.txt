b'Internet Business Solutions\n\n)\n\n-\n\nThe dictionary defines the word "cogent" as\n"convincing, compelling belief." For David\nAtkinson, president and CEO of Cogent\nSoftware, Inc. in Pasadena, California, it is his belief that\nthe Internet is changing the way we do business. It is a\npersonal conviction of Atkinson that you can\'t let your\ncompetition leave you behind in the information\nrevolution.\nCogent Software was founded in January 1995 to\nsupport customers with Internet business solutions.\nJoining Atkinson in founding Cogent is Irene Woerner.\nBoth individuals, as well as several other Cogent\nemployees, formerly worked at the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory (JPL). The NASA-developed expertise of\nCogent\'s key personnel, according to Atkinson, is one\nkey to the company\'s early success in providing low-cost,\nhigh-quality service and completed projects.\nAtkinson headed JPL\'s Information Systems\nTechnology section, managing operations technology\nand artificial intelligence program development for\nNASA. Woerner led JPrs Advanced User Interfaces\nGroup, where she conceived and directed the research\nand development of NASA hypermedia library systems.\nCogent Sobare\'s mission is to help companies\norganize and manage their online content by developing\nadvanced software for the next generation of online\ndirectories and information catalogs.\nWhile still a young entrepreneurial start-up, Cogent\nalready offers a complete range of Internet solutions for\nbusinesses, including Internet access, Web site design,\nlocal and wide-area network solutions, and custom\nsoftware for online commerce applications.
