Driven to repeat stepping cycle rapidly enough to achieve maximum speed of about 20 rpm, provides torque an order of magnitude greater than electric motors, and brakes itself when power turned off. Magnetostrictive rods in electromagnet coils push against drive plate, causing it to rotate slightly. This slight rotation jams conical rollers between cam surfaces on outer drive ring and split drum, so rollers transmit rotation to drum. Suitable for precise, high-torque, fail-safe-braking, direct drive of robot joint, without bulk and weight of additional brake mechanism and gear train.", "title": "Magnetostrictive Roller-Drive Stepping Motor", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T04:40:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930000293, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vranish, John M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD."}}, "id": "35b7bca0c269469f9947fb24e7a48ff4"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - NASA Tech Brief", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930000293, "publications": [{"volume": "17", "submissionId": 19930000293, "issue": "5", "issn": "0145-319X", "id": "2cf20cefad0c4beca0663433a3db8952", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs", "publicationDate": "1993-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
