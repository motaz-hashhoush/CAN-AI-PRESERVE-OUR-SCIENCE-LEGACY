b'Introduction\nCertain populations such as chemotherapy patients and atomic bomb survivors have been\nexposed to ionizing radiation and experience tissue damage and cancer initiation and progression. One\ncancer that can be initiated from radiation is esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), an epithelial\ncancer that has a survival rate as low as 20% (Chunping et al., 2009). Researchers have found that when\nprotein tyrosine kinase receptors (RPTK) activate oncogenes, they can create epithelial tumors and\ncause deadly cancers like ESCC (Tannock et al., 2005). The RPTK family has one group, MET, that has only\ntwo receptors, MET and RON, present in the human body. MET\xe2\x80\x99s ligand is the hepatocyte growth factor\n(HGF) and RON\xe2\x80\x99s ligand is the macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP-1). Both HGF and MSP-1 have been\nshown to activate their receptors and are implicated in certain processes [What processes are these?]\n(Wang et al., 2003). Since radiation damages cells throughout the biological system (Camphausen et. al,\n2001), researchers are investigating whether or not HGF and MSP-1 protects or kills certain normal and\ncancerous cells by being part of cell recovery processes.\nOne research group recently reviewed that the HGF-MET pathway has an important role in the\nembryonic development in the liver, migration of myogenic precursor cells, regulation of epithelial\nmorphogenesis and growth, and regeneration and protection in tissues (Nakamura et. al, 2011). In\naddition, since the RON receptor is more commonly expressed in cells of epithelial origin, and when\nactivated is part of epithelial cell matrix invasion, dissociation, and migration processes, scientists\nconclude that RON might be one of the factors causing epithelial cancer initiation in the biological\nsystem (Wang et. al, 2003). In order to examine HGF and MSP-1\xe2\x80\x99s effect on cancer initiation and\nprogression we used two immortalized esophageal epithelial cell lines. One is a normal human cell line\n(EPC2-hTERT), while the other had a p53 mutation at the 175th amino acid position (EPC2-hTERTp53R175H). For this investigation, we used 0(control), 2, and 4 Gray doses of gamma (Cs137) radiation and\nselected various concentrations from 0-100 ng/mL of HGF and MSP-1 in our assays.\n1\n\nSince the HGF and MSP-1 pathways have proliferative roles in epithelial cells, we conducted the\nMTT proliferation assay to see if either drug enhances or inhibits cell proliferation over time. Also, a MTT\ncytotoxicity assay was necessary to observe whether the drugs are protecting the cells from radiation\nand if a trend is occurring depending upon the amount of dose added. In addition, a wound healing\nassay was done since both drugs have been to known to promote cell motility. Since cell damage occurs\nwhen radiation is added, apoptosis and micronuclei assays are vital to see if HGF and MSP-1 increase or\ndecrease cell death and damage in normal and pre-cancerous cells and by how much based on the\nradiation dosage. Overall, we used the MTT, wound healing, apoptosis and micronuclei assays to\ninvestigate the effects ofHGF and MSP-1 on irradiated esophageal epithelial cells.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\xef\x83\x98 Cell Lines: Normal (EPC2-hTERT) and mutated (EPC2-hTERT-p53R175H) esophageal\nepithelial cell lines were used this investigation. The cells were cultured and maintained\naccording to the Phelan, 1998 cell culture protocol.\n\xef\x83\x98 Radiation Dosages: The gamma (Cs137) radiation doses ranged from 0-4 Gys. (0-400\nrads).\n\xef\x83\x98 Drugs: Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP-1)\nconcentrations ranged from 10-100 ng/mL depending on the assay.\n\xef\x83\x98 Incubation Settings: 37\xc2\xb0 Celsius, 5% CO2, 98% humidity\n\xef\x83\x98 Controls: No drug or cells with KBM (keratinocyte basal medium)\n\xef\x83\x98 4 assays: MTT Proliferation and Cytotoxicity, Wound Healing, Micronuclei assay, and\nApoptosis Assay\n\n2\n\n1. MTT Proliferation and Cytotoxicity\nMaterials:\n\xef\x83\x98 7 (4 for proliferation and 3 for cytotoxicity) 96-well plates\n\xef\x83\x98 MTT Solvent: 4mM HCl, 0.1% Nandet P-40 (NP40) all in isopropanol\n\xef\x83\x98 MTT Reagant*: (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide)\n\xef\x83\x98 PBS solution\n\xef\x83\x98 Aluminum/tin foil\n\xef\x83\x98 TECAN Spectroflorometer\n*Reagant is prepared with a concentration 5 mg/mL in PBS and is covered with foil\nMethods:\n1. Culture the cells (2000 cells/well) with KSFM (keratinocyte serum free medium) in the\nplates and incubate for 24 hours.\n2. Add HGF and MSP-1 (10, 50, and 100 ng/ml) in each well according to the plate setup of\nboth proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. Incubate again for 24 hours.\nProliferation:\n1. Take one plate for the 24 hour reading and add 20 \xc2\xb5L of the 5 mg/mL MTT Reagent\nper well. After putting it on the shaker for a few minutes, incubate it for 3.5 hours.\n2. Remove the media from the wells and add 150 \xc2\xb5L MTT solvent per well quickly since\nthe plate is photosensitive. Put it on the shaker for 15 minutes.\n3. Read the plate by using the TECAN spectrofluorometer.\n4. At 48, 72, and 96 hours, repeat the same steps taken for the 24 hour reading.\nCytotoxicity:\n3\n\n1. Irradiate one plate each at 0, 2, and 4 Gray doses.\n2. After 72 hours, repeat the same steps taken for the 24 hour proliferation plate for\nthe 3 cytotoxicity plates.\nAnalysis:\nTo test how many live cells were present over the 96-hour or 72-hour period, we measured the\nintensity of the purple formazan color, which is produced when living mitochondria converts\nthe yellow MTT reagent to purple by using enzymes during the 3.5 hour incubation period. The\nTECAN spectroflorometer then uses an absorbance at an optical density of 590 nm to measure\nthis intensity and give values. For the proliferation assay, we can observe if HGF and/or MSP-1\npromotes cell proliferation without any stress added to the experiment. In the cytotoxicity\nassay, we are adding the radiation factor to see if at one particular time if either drug protects\nboth types of cells (Wallert and Provost Lab, 2007).\n2. Wound Healing\nMaterials:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3 24-well plates (2 with no radiation and 1 with a dose of 2 Gray)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCamera\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPBS solution\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n200 \xc2\xb5L pipette tip\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMarker with a visible color as biomarker\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMedia that contains KBM with HGF or MSP-1 (both drugs at 50 ng/mL)\n\nMethods:\n1. Draw a line with a marker on the bottom of each well\n4\n\n2. Use the tip to scratch once on each well to create a wound\n3. Rinse the whole plate of cells with PBS solution\n4. Replace the PBS solution with 1.5 mL of media containing the drug\n5. Take a picture of each well at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hrs.\n. [This is not the case \xe2\x80\x93 media was left on the whole time]\nAnalysis:\nWe used Image J (NIH) to measure the length of the wound from each picture taken**. After\ndrawing two lines parallel to each other where the cells are bordered and one line connecting\nboth perpendicularly, the software measures the length of the gap between the two sides of\ncells. We can then plot these values and find the percentage of the wound healed. For example,\nif 100% is the percentage at 24 hours, it means that the drug facilitated the cells to migrate and\nfill the gap completely over 24 hours. The wound assay can help us determine whether HGF and\nMSP-1 promote cell motility (Wallert and Provost Lab, 2004).\n**Error: One picture of the p53 plate at 9 hours was missing.\n2.

Wash with PBS three times, with each for 5 minutes. Add DAPI solution (350 \xc2\xb5L/well)\nand incubate the slides for 5 minutes. Wash the cells again with PBS three times (five\nminutes each).\n5. Mount each slide by adding 3-4 drops of SlowFade Gold and using a 22x50 mm cover\nglass. Seal each slide with nailpolish on the outer boundary.\nCounting:\n1. Turn on the microscope.\n2. Add one drop of oil immersol on Coverslip.\n3. Touch the 100x objective lenses with the oil and turn on the fluorescence blue light\n4. Count the number of micronuclei and binucleated cells.\nPicture 1: A field of view showing 1 binucleated cell\nwith one micronuclei.\n\nAnalysis:\n6\n\nWhen the fluorescence light is turned on, we counted the blue cells that are binucleated and\nalso the ones that have micronuclei (Picture 1). We analyzed the percentage of micronuclei of\nall the binucleated cells to find quantitatively how much damage occurred since micronuclei is\ncomposed of DNA fragments that are all clumped together.

Use 3-4 drops of Prolong Gold with\nDAPI/slide, and use 22x50mm cover glass to mount and seal each slide with nail polish.\nCounting: same as in Micronuclei assay except:\n1. Touch the 60x objective lenses with the oil and switch between the blue & green lights\n2. Count positive (green) cells/1000 blue (normal) cells = apoptotic index.\n***If storing, replace paraformaldehyde with PBS and cover with parafilm, and store it at 4\xc2\xb0 C.\nAnalysis:\n\nPicture 2: A field of view showing 2 positive\napoptotic cells and many other blue cells.\n\nFor this assay, we counted the positive apoptotic (green) and negative normal (blue) cells to see\nif any cleaved caspase-3 enzymatic activity occurred. For every field of view, we counted the\nnumber of blue cells first while the blue light is on. Then, we switched to the green light to see\nif any positive cells were there in the same field of view. If there is at least one bright green cell,\nwe switched back to the blue light to see if a blue cell is overlapping in the same position to\nclarify if it actually a cell (Picture 2) (Promega, 2011).\nResults\n\nPicture 2: A field of view showing normal\n(blue) and two apoptotic (green) cells.\n\n1. MTT Proliferation and Cytotoxicity\n8\n\nProliferation: The MTT proliferation assay was conducted with 10, 50, or 100 ng/mL\nconcentrations of HGF and MSP-1 in both normal and mutated cell lines over a 96-hour period.\nThe results present that cell proliferation increased over time in both normal and mutated cells.\nInterestingly, there was no positive or negative effect in both cell lines as the concentrations of\neither drugs (10, 50, and 100ng/mL) increased. When considering HGF and MSP-1, our results\nshow that both drugs do not aid in cell proliferation in both normal and mutated epithelial cells\n(Figure 1.1a & 1.1b).\n\nEPC2-hTERT\n14\n\nAbsorbance OD590\n\nNo Drug\n12\n\nHGF10\n\n10\n\nHGF 50\n\n8\n\nHGF 100\n\n6\n\nMSP 10\nMSP 50\n\n4\n\nMSP 100\n2\n0\n24 hr\n\n48 hr\n\n72 hr\n\n96 hr\n\nTime\nEPC2-hTERT-p53R175H\n\nAbsorbance OD590\n\n12\nFigure 1.1a: The Effect of HGF and MSP at concentrations of 10 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL and 100\nNo Drug\nng/mL over a 96 hour period on normal EPC2-hTERT esophageal epithelial cells.\n10\nHGF10\n\nHGF 50\n\n8\n\nHGF 100\n6\nMSP 10\n4\n\nMSP 50\nMSP 100\n\n2\n0\n24 hr\n\n48 hr\n\nTime\n\n72 hr\n\n96 hr\n\n9\n\nFigure 1.1b: The Effect of HGF and MSP at concentrations of 50 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL\nover a 96 hour period on mutated EPC2-hTERT-p53R175H esophageal epithelial cells.\nCytotoxicity: For the MTT Cytotoxicity assay, the cells were given 2 and 4 Gray dosages of\ngamma radiation with two HGF and MSP-1 (50 or 100 ng/mL) concentrations. The results\npresented in Figures 1.2a & 1.2b show that as radiation dosage increased in both cell lines with\nno drug, the number of EPC2-hTERTdecreased significantly while there was little change in the\np53-mutated cells. When considering HGF and MSP-1\xe2\x80\x99s effects, they interestingly protected the\nnormal cells more than the mutated cells from radiation (Figure 1.2a & 1.2b).\n\nEPC2-hTERT\n\n1.4\n\nAbsorbance OD590\n\n1.2\nNo Drug\n\n1\n\nHGF 50\n0.8\n\nHGF 100\nMSP 50\n\n0.6\n\nMSP 100\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n2 Gy\n0\nGy\nFigure 1.2a: The EffectGy HGF and MSP (50 and 100 4ng/mL) with gamma radiation\nof\nRadiation Dose (Cs137)\n137\n(Cs ) dosages of 2 and 4 Gray at 72 hours on cytotoxicty of irradiated normal\nEPC2-hTERT esophageal epithelial cells.\n\nEPC2-hTERT-p53R175H\n\n1.4\n\nAbsorbance OD590\n\n1.2\nNo Drug\n\n1\n\nHGF 50\n0.8\n\nHGF 100\nMSP 50\n\n0.6\n\nMSP 100\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0 Gy\n\n2 Gy\n\n4 Gy\n\nRadiation Dose (Cs137)\n\nFigure 1.2b: The Effect of HGF and MSP (50 and 100 ng/mL) with gamma radiation (Cs137)\ndosages of 2 and 4 Gray at 72 hours on cytoxicity of p53-mutated esophageal epithelial cells.\n\n10\n\n2. Wound Healing: This assay allowed us to observe how much normal and mutated cells\nmigrated with 50 or 100 ng/mL concentrations of HGF and MSP-1 over a 24 hour period.\nAccording to the results shown in Figures 2.1 & 2.2, both HGF and MSP-1 enhanced cell\nmigration more than the cells with only KBM after 24 hours. To compare overall how\nmuch the normal and mutated cells migrated with the KBM control, HGF, and MSP-1\nfactors, Figure 2.3 is shown after 12 hours of healing. From Figure 2.3, HGF seems to be\nan effective drug in enhancing cell migration in normal cells than in the mutated cells\nsince HGF in general increases cell proliferation.

Micronuclei Assay: The cells were irradiated at 2 and 4 Gray with 50 or 100 ng/mL\n\nconcentrations of HGF and MSP-1. In both figures, radiation seems to cause significant\ncell damage since there was an increase in the percentage of binucleated cells with\nmicronuclei in both cell lines as the radiation dosage increased. Specifically for HGF,\nmore micronuclei formed in both types of cells except at 4 Gray for the mutated cells.\nAlso, at 2 Gray, both HGF and MSP-1 did not enhance micronuclei formation activity in\n\n% Binucleated Cells with\nMicronuclei\n\nnormal cells as much as in the mutated cells (Figures 3.1 & 3.2).\n\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\nFigure 3.1: The Effect of HGF and MSP (50 ng/mL each) Figure 3.2: The Effect of HGF and MSP (50\nR175H\non normal EPC2-hTERT esophageal epithelial cells with ng/mL each) on mutated EPC2-hTERT-p53\nesophageal epithelial cells with 0, 200, or 400\n0, 2, or 4 Grays of Cs137 gamma radiation.\nrads (0, 2, 4 Gys.) of Cs137 gamma radiation.\n\n4. Apoptosis Assay: In this assay, we added 50 or 100 ng/mL concentrations of HGF and\nMSP-1 to both cell lines and counted them after 48 hours of radiation exposure (2 or 4\nGray). According to the results shown in Figures 4.1 & 4.2, as radiation dosage\nincreased, the apoptotic activity (programmed cell death) increased in both cell lines in\n\n12\n\nrespect to the drug added. Without any radiation dosage, HGF and MSP-1 enhanced\napoptosis (Figures 4.1 & 4.2). Specifically in Figure 4.1, HGF had no/little effect while\nMSP-1 significantly inhibited cell death in the normal cells.

At these concentrations and times tested,\nthe growth factors may not promote proliferation. Additional explanations include several\nerrors such as possible bacterial contamination, not protecting the plates from light, time\nmisalignments, and pippetting errors might have caused this. In the future, conducting more\nruns might give better and consistent results with previous work that has already been done on\nthis assay for HGF and MSP-1.\n\n13\n\nIn the MTT test for cytotoxicity, the normal cells had significant changes in samples with\nand without drug as radiation dosage increased. This supports earlier reports that HGF and\nMSP-1 have protective properties on cells from stress. (Nakamura et. al, 2011) (Wang et. al,\n2003). When HGF or MSP-1 was added, they had significant protection, especially the cells with\nMSP-1 (100 ng/mL). For the p53-mutated cells, there was no effect of radiation and there were\nlittle differences even among the cells with HGF or MSP-1. Cancer cells are known to replicate\nfast, especially with the well known p53 mutation. This mutation prevents a cell with DNA\ndamage from undergoing apoptosis, thus allowing it to proliferate. This explains why the\nmutated cells with no drug did not die easily (Vogelstein et al., 2000). If the mutated cells are\nalready protecting themselves, then the drugs\xe2\x80\x99 intervention would not make much difference,\nwhich is clearly shown in the figures. Additionally, if the cells are already programmed to\nproliferate, then the 2 and 4 Gray doses may not be enough to reduce the number of cells and\nobserve if HGF and MSP-1 take part in protecting the cells. If the mutated cells are much more\naggressive than the normal cells, then in the future, higher doses may be used to see better\nresults.\nThe wound healing assay showed that both drugs enhanced migration in both cell lines.\nThere were positive results in both figures, but might give contradictory information when\nconsidering the drugs for chemotherapy purposes. HGF and MSP-1\xe2\x80\x99s migration activity was\nhigher than the KBM control\xe2\x80\x99s after 24 hours for both cell lines. Previous research has shown\nthat HGF\xe2\x80\x99s effect in epidermal keratinocytes (Nakamura et. al, 2011) and MSP-1\xe2\x80\x99s intervention\nin epithelial cancers (Wang et. al, 2003) resulted in similar results. In the normal cells, HGF\naddition resulted in 100% wound healing and MSP-1 addition resulted in 47% wound healing.\n14\n\nComment [ZP1]: Do not use words like\n\xe2\x80\x9csuccessful\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunsuccessful\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of\nexperiments and data. The data is what it is, neither\n\xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the mutated cells, HGF\xe2\x80\x99s still 100% and MSP-1\xe2\x80\x99s (83%) higher percentage of wound healed\nshow that recovery of cancerous cells is occurring.MSP-1 appears to have a greater motogenic\neffect on p53-mutated cells compared to normal epithelial cells, indicating that pre-cancerous\ncell lines are more sensitive to external cues that can lead to migration and invasion (hallmarks\nof cancer) (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research).Future studies on how HGF and MSP-1\xe2\x80\x99s\naffects other epithelial cancers may show if the trends found in this project is only specific\ntoesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\nIn the micronuclei assay, both figures show that as the radiation dosage increased, cell\ndamage increased for the control, HGF, and MSP-1 in both cell lines. Without considering the\ndifference in the scales in both figures, all cells with either/no drug increased the percentage of\nmicronuclei at 4 Gray compared to the other dosages. Also, considering the difference in the\nscales, there was more cell damage occurring in the mutated cells than in the normal cells. This\nmight explain the fact that since all the cells are still living, the radiation causes significant\ndamage on cells that do not have cell repair processes that work properly (NIH, 1999). For the\nnormal cells, HGF enhanced more cell damage at the highest dose, showing that HGF may not\nbe advisable for future chemotherapy treatments. For MSP-1, one study supported our results\nthat MSP-1 had a neutral effect on the normal cells (Sifa, 2009). On the other hand, MSP-1\ncaused more cell damage than HGF at the highest dose in the mutated cells, suggesting that\nMSP-1 could be investigated further as a potential drug in cancer research. Even though HGF\nand MSP-1 caused certain trends in both cell lines, more runs on this assay should be done to\nconfirm our observations that may account for counting errors and possible contamination with\nthe cells. Lastly, both figures present that more micronuclei are forming in the mutated cells\n15\n\nthan the normal cells (see the scales closely) no matter which drug is used. This observation is\nimportant since this assay involves with only live cells, it suggests that the pre-cancerous cells\nare surviving with cell damage that can cause further deterioration on the human esophagus.\nUnder normal circumstances, the cells that are having significant amounts of damage should be\nundergoing apoptosis (NIH, 1999); however, the p53 mutation prevents this and clearly shows\nthat further investigation on this matter is vital (Vogelstein et al., 2000).\nIn general, as radiation dosage increased, more apoptotic activity occurred (Camphausen\net. al, 2001). Even though HGF did not affect the normal cells in any way, the drug promoted\n\napoptosis in the mutated cells (especially at 4 Gray). On the other hand, MSP-1 inhibited\napoptosis in the normal cells significantly while promoting apoptosis at 4 Gray in the mutated\ncells. This supported by a research group\xe2\x80\x99s findings that MSP-1 is known to help epithelial cells\nsurvive since there was less than 10% apoptotic activity in normal epithelial cell cultures than in\ncultures with only media (Danilkovitch et. al, 1999). HGF and MSP-1 both seem to show\nopposites trends again, as seen in the micronuclei assay. To confirm HGF\xe2\x80\x99s neutrality on\nirradiated normal cells, higher doses should be used in the future to see if that is not the case.\nAlso, even though MSP-1 may be thought as a possible drug in future cancer treatments, MSP-1\ndid not show major differences at 2 Gray for the mutated cells. More runs on this assay may be\nnecessary to see if MSP-1 is only effective to promote apoptosis in ESCC at 4 Gray dose.\nConclusion\n\nThere were many factors used to investigate HGF and MSP-1\xe2\x80\x99s activities. We used radiation as\nan environmental stress and found that the drugs may be most active only at certain dosages.\nWe have found that while 2 and 4 Gray doses are sufficient to cause protection in the normal\n16\n\ncells, HGF and MSP-1 seem to need more dosages of radiation have an effect on the p53 cells.\nWhen forming micronuclei, both drugs enhanced more cell damage in the p53 cells than the\nnormal cells, with MSP-1 only causing more at 4 Gray in the p53 cells than the normal hTERT\ncells. In terms of apoptosis, both drugs caused much damage at 4 Gray in the cancerous cells.\nAlso, MSP-1 prevented significant cell death as the radiation dosage increased in the normal\ncells. Since radiation has brought both short and long term effects on astronauts in the past\ndecades, current investigation is occurring now in finding out the role of certain growth factors\nin radiation-induced esophageal carcinogenesis..\n\n17\n\n'
