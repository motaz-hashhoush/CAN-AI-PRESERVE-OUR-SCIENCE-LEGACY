b'Longhorn\n\nBusiness Jets\n\nThe airplane shown is the new Learjet Longhorn 55,\na twin-turbofan,\n13-place widebody business jet\nwhich--along\nwith visually identical companion\nmodels Longhorn 54 and 56--will make its service\ndebut this year. Manufactured\nby Gates Learjet\nCorporation,\nWichita, Kansas, the Longhorn 54/55/\n56 models feature "winglets," nearly-vertical\nextensions\nof the wing (shown in closeup below).\nDeveloped\nin NASA\'s Aircraft Energy Efficiency\n\n60\n\nprogram, the winglet is an aerodynamic\ninnovation\ndesigned to reduce fuel consumption\nand generally\nimprove airplane performance.\nGates Learjet was\nthe first manufacturer\nto use the winglet design in\nproduction-type\njets, initially on the Longhorn 28/29\nmodels introduced\nto service in 1979. Several other\nplane builders are taking advantage of the NASA\ntechnology.\nWinglets are lifting surfaces designed to operate\nin the "vortex," or air whirlpool, which occurs at an\nairplane\'s wingtip. This complex flow of air around\nthe wingtip creates drag which retards the plane\'s\nprogress. The winglet reduces the strength of the\nvortex and thereby substantially\nreduces drag. Additionally, the winglet generates its own lift, producing\nforward thrust in the manner of a boat\'s sail. The\ncombination\nof reduced drag and additional\nthrust\nadds up to significant improvement\nin fuel efficiency.\nWinglets are particularly\neffective on the Learjet\nLonghorns,\nwhich are capable of flying at altitudes\nup to 51,000 feet, unusual for civil aircraft. At such\naltitudes, where the air is thinner, the drag reduction afforded by the winglets is more pronounced,\nthus fuel savings are greater. Winglets, together\nwith an advanced design basic wing, give the Longhorns longer range than predecessor\nLearjets for the\nsame speed and payload; alternatively,\nfor the same\nrange and payload, they can fly at lower takeoff\nweight because less fuel is required.\n\n'
