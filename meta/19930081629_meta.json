A single-cylinder test unit utilizing an air-cooled cylinder and a carburetor and operating with gasoline having an octane rating of 92 was used. The investigation covered a range of fuel-air ratios from 0.053 to 0.118. Indicator diagrams and engine-performance data were taken for each change in engine conditions. Examination of the indicator shows that for fuel-air ratios less than and greater than 0.082 the rate and the amount of effective fuel burned decreased. For a fuel-air ratio of 0.118 the combustion efficiency was only 58 percent. Advancing the spark timing increased the rate of pressure rise. This effect was more pronounced with leaner mixtures.", "title": "Analysis of Cylinder-pressure-indicator Diagrams Showing Effects of Mixture Strength and Spark Timing", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:21:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930081629, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gerrish, Harold C"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "5914479e9003451dbe84cb8899297677"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930081629, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Voss, Fred"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "cb080813939c477cb6e19d4b630e1020"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-06-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930081629, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930081629, "id": "d5ccf4a0d7b1469086800ea7eab2b754", "publicationDate": "1940-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930081629.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930081629/downloads/19930081629.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930081629/downloads/19930081629.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930081629/downloads/19930081629.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
