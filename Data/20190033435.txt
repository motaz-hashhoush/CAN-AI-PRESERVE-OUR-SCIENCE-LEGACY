Should any unexpected delays occur, this\ncan be used to restore the frozen orbit.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The graph shows burns separated by 5 through 14 days with the\nsecond burn offset to restore the tight frozen orbit.\n\n12\n\nMission Operations Working Group\nDecember 3-5, 2019\n\nRe-Centering the Frozen Orbit\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The table shows how the\nsecond burn should be\nphased with the first in\norder to re-center the frozen\norbit.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 By phasing the burn by 140\ndegrees, the final apogee\nand perigee could be 500 m\noff from a nominal 180\ndegree phasing.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This will, however, reduce\nthe efficiency of lowering\nthe orbit.\n\nBurn\nSeparation\n(days)\n\nBurn Phasing\n(degrees)\n\n5\n\n168\n\n6\n\n166\n\n7\n\n165\n\n8\n\n164\n\n9\n\n160\n\n10\n\n156\n\n11\n\n152\n\n12\n\n150\n\n13\n\n145\n\n14\n\n140\n\n113\n\nMission Operations Working Group\nDecember 3-5, 2019\n\nBurn Location Analysis\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Purpose: To analyze the effects of changing the location of the\nfirst burn from apogee and the effects of different phasing of the\nsecond burn.\n\n14\n\nMission Operations Working Group\nDecember 3-5, 2019\n\nShifting First Burn Location\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This video shows how the\nfrozen orbit is effected by\nshifting the first burn.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Burn pairs 180 degrees apart.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The bounds of the graph are\nTerra\xe2\x80\x99s frozen orbit limits.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Eccentricity: 0.0012 +/- 0.0004.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Argument of Perigee: 90 +/- 20\ndeg.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Because Terra\xe2\x80\x99s orbit is nearly\ncircular, centering the burn at a\nlocation other than apogee does\nnot have a major effect on the\nfinal orbit so long as the second\nburn is still phased at 180.\n15\n\nMission Operations Working Group\nDecember 3-5, 2019\n\nShifting First Burn Location\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Shifting the apogee has\nlittle effect on the final\napogee and perigee.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There is a 100 m\ndifference between the\nhighest and lowest\nresulting apogee.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There is also a 100 m\ndifference between the\nhighest and lowest\nresulting perigee.\n\n16\n\nMission Operations Working Group\nDecember 3-5, 2019\n\nShifting Second Burn Location\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This video shows how the\nfrozen orbit is effected by\nphasing (i.e. relative location)\nof the second burn.\n\xe2\x80\x93 The first burn was fixed while the second\nwas varied.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The bounds of the graph are\nTerra\xe2\x80\x99s frozen orbit limits.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For phasing less than about 90\ndegrees and greater than about\n270 degrees, the frozen orbit\nlimits will be violated.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 By shifting the phasing, you can\nshift the center of Terra\xe2\x80\x99s frozen\norbit.\n17\n\nMission Operations Working Group\nDecember 3-5, 2019\n\nShifting Second Burn Location\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Phasing the second burn\nhas a significant impact\non the final apogee and\nperigee.\n\xe2\x80\x93 With no phasing between\nburns, there is no change\nin the final apogee, and\nthe change in perigee\ndoubles from the nominal\ncase.\n\xe2\x80\x93 An offset of 15 degrees\nfrom the nominal 180\ndegree phasing will\nchange the orbit by about\n200 m.\n18\n\nMission Operations Working Group\nDecember 3-5, 2019\n\nConclusions\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The best CEM plan to reduce the risk of a close under flight is to\nperform the first burn pair with the longest possible duration, then\nperform trim burn pairs as needed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 While the time between CEM burns does have a significant effect\non a spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s frozen orbit, it is not enough to violate the frozen\norbit within a reasonable span of time.\n\xe2\x80\x93 The current plan is to perform Terra\xe2\x80\x99s CEM burn pair with a day of\nseparation\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Shifting the first burn from apogee does not effect frozen orbit or\nfinal apogee and perigee so long as the second burn is phased by\n180 degrees with the first.\n\n19\n\n'
