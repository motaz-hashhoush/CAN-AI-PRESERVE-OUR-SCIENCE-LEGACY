The status of these tasks, noting accomplishments,\nimpact items, and forward actions is reported in the MICS.\n\nII\n\nThe draft FY 80 AOP, although required to be submitted by September I,\n1979, was not released to DOE until December 1979. This delay was a\nbilateral\nagreement pending NASA\'s decision pertaining\nto the DOErequest\nfor LeRC to become the lead center for thermal storage.\nPROJECT\nASSESSMENT\nDuring this reporting\nperiod, specific\nproject assessments focused on the\ncompletion of system studies for "Peak Following Thermal Storage for Steam\nElectric\nPower". For near-term utility\napplications\nit was felt that\nthermal energy storage could be easily "retrofitted"\nto existing\npower\nplants.\nHowever, an earlier\nproject assessment by Bechtel concluded that\nhigh capital costs and long retrofit\ndowntimes negated the use of thermal\nenergy storage.\nOn the positive\nside, it was recommendedthat thermal\nenergy storage might be attractive\nfor "new construction"\ncoal and nuclear\npower plant application.\nA second assessment completed in FY 7g For New\nPlant Thermal Energy Systems was performed by General Electric\nGENERAL\nELECTRIC\nCDEN3-1)\n2\nThis "new plant" assessment was quite extensive and examined some50 plus\ntechnologies applicable to thermal energy storage subsystems.

The activities\nof the lead\ncenter include coordinating\na research and technology development program\nand managing several of the efforts\nwithin that program. The program has\nthree objectives.\nThe first\nobjective\nis to establish\nadvanced\ntechnologies for TES systems to improve upon baseline system performance\nand/or lower storage system costs.\nThe second objective\nis to resolve\nproblems that are generic to several applications.\nTypical examples of\nthese problems are requirements for improved heat transfer\nand\nidentification\nof suitable storage media or appropriate containment\nmaterials.\nThe third objective\nis to provide any support required for the\ndevelopment of baseline TES systems.\nMany of the projects,\nespecially\nthose that are focused on a specific\napplication,\nare originated\nat and implemented by the lead laboratories.\nThe projects may be conducted by a private organization\non contract to the\nlead laboratory\nor may be conducted in-house.\nThe functions\nof the lead\ncenter are to coordinate the various projects between the organizations\ninvolved,\nto recommend projects that are focused on a specific\napplication,\nand to conduct investigations\nthat address issues generic to\nseveral applications.\nAPPROACH\nThe research and technology development program consists of several types\nof activities.\nNew storage concepts are identified\nand then assessed to\ndetermine performance and cost potentials\nand identify\nrequired technology\ndevelopments. Materials that are candidates for TES media are\ninvestigated\nto determine heat transfer\nand corrosion characteristics.\nProof-of-concept\nexperiments are conducted for the concepts that have the\nmost potential.\nAnother activity\nis the engineering evaluation\nof\nprototype storage modules to evaluate present technology.\nThere are two\ncharacteristics\nthat are commonto most of these activities.\nThe\nactivities\nare relatively\nshort-term projects and usually include\nlaboratory or bench scale experiments.\nThe activities\n\nbeing managed by LeRC are shown below:\n\nI079\n\nNE_\'_\nCONCEPTS\n\nI\n\n,980\n\nI\n\nJIFIMIAIMI\nJIJIAIS NIDIJlE AIMI_\nIoJ\nIt\'_l\nIJIAIslOi IDIJIFI_\'_J\nN\nA]\n\nASSESSMENI FS_STEMSUSING\nO\nFLUIDIZEDBED\nHEATEXCHANGERS\nICP: MRII DEN3-%\nADVANCED\nMEDIA\nTHERMOPHYSIbALPROPERIY\nMEASUREMENT\nOFMETALALLO\'Y\nMEDIA\nISS: UNIVERSITY DELAWAREt\nOF\nNSG B184\nHIGHTEMPERATURE\nMOLTEN-SALT\nLATE%T EAT\nH\nYESLAB.

The advantages of a fluidized\nbed heat exchanger, even though staging is required,\nare that the solid\nparticles\nare mobile and can readily\nbe transferred\nfrom one bed to\nanother or to a storage vessel.\nIn addition,\nthe particle\nmobility\neliminates\nthe thermal stress limitation\nwhich is frequently\nencountered\nwith either cored brick or pebble bed heaters.\nHowever, as with any heat exchanger/storage/application\ncombination, there\nexists technological\nuncertainties\nand potential\ncomponent/system\nintegration\nproblems which must be analyzed before cost benefits can be\naccurately assessed. The need for this identification\nand the\ntechno-economic assessment of a viable heat exchanger/storage\nsystem\nbecomes the justification\nfor this proposed effort.\nMIDWEST\nRESEARCH\nINSTITUTE\n(DEN 3-96)\nMidwest Research Institute\nwas awarded the program to provide and\nparametrically\nanalyze the operating characteristics\nand the economics of\nselected thermal energy storage applications\nutilizing\nfluidized\nbed heat\nexchangers.\nSpecific task objectives\nwere: (I) the definition\nof\npotential\nfluidized\nbed concepts for thermal energy storage applications,\nand (2) a techno-economic evaluation\nof selected heat exchanger/storage/\nappl i cati on systems.\n\n19\n\nIn Task I, Application\nIdentification,\nConcept Definition\nand Integration\nthe MRI recommended six fluidized\nbed applications,\nthe majority\nof which\nused the multi-staged\nbeds. These applications\nwere as follows:\nI.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nCement Plant - Rotary Kiln/Clinker\nCooler\nSteel Plant - Electric\nArc Furnace\nCopper Smelting - Reverberatory Furnace/Converter\nSteel Plant - Iron Ore Sintering\nSteel Plant - Dry Quench Coke\nSolar Brayton Power Plant - Solar Receptor Supplement\n\nFrom these six applications,\nthe cement plant and the steel plant\n(electric\narc furnace) were selected as the two applications\nfor the\ndetailed Task II Technical Analysis and Economic Evaluation.\nBoth of\nthese applications\nwould utilize\nthe multi-stage\nfluidized\nbed thermal\nenergy storage subsystem.\n_l\'s\nassessment has been completed and, the fluidized\nbed TES\napplications\n(electric\narc furnace, cement kiln) were found to be\nmarginally\ncompetitive for near-term, baseline systems (e.g. Element 3.0\nIndustrial\nStorage Applications)\nbased on utility\nrate structure/\nincentives.\nIt was also recommended that fluidized\nbeds for advanced\napplications\n(solar thermal) should be assessed in the near future based\non systems identified\nas part of Element 4.0 (Solar Thermal Applications).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMU LTI-TAGE\nS\nFLUIDIZED ED HEAT\nB\n\ni !4g_\n(\n\nEXCHANGER/STORAGE\n_\'" \\\\ --D\n\nRAW METERIAL\nPREPARATION\nRAW\nMATERIALS\n,_\n\ni\n\nICOLD\n-- -IC\n-- --[_--_\nISOLIDS\n\nRAW\n\nCOMMON\nDUST\n\nA\nI\n\nI STACK\n\nI WASTEBoILER\nHEAT\n_\n\nIW\n\nD\n\nII\n\nIHOT\n\nESP\n\nI\nsOLIDs\n\nAMBIENT\n\nI \xe2\x80\xa2 CRUSHING\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GRINDING\n_I\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBLEND-\n\nISTORE _____._C\n\nBLENDING\n\nC x_----_=\n\nSTORE\n;\n\nD\n\nL----]\n\nq -_ 5_\xc2\xb0C\n\nPREHEATER\ni .

The\ncorrosion characteristics\nof the media are evaluated to determine what\ntypes of materials\nare suitable for containing the media. A literature\nsearch may be conducted to determine if the appropriate properties for TES\nhave been determined and if the reported values agree sufficiently\nwell.\nIf warranted, studies would be performed to determine properties\nsuch as\nspecific\nheat, latent heat of fusion,\nand thermal conductivity\nfor the\npurities\nexpected in production quantitites\nappropriate for TES\napplications.\nThere are two efforts\nthat are investigating\nadvanced media; the first\nevaluating\ncarbonate salts for high temperature applications\nand the\nsecond is a feasibility\nstudy of using metal alloys as TES media.\n\nis\n\nINSTITUTE OF GASTECHNOLOGY\n(DEN 3-156)\nThe Institute\nof Gas Technology has been investigating\ncarbonate salt\nmixtures as viable candidates for high temperature applications.\nUnder\nthe auspices of ERDA, Contract No. EY-76-C-02-2888, "Molten Salt Thermal\nEnergy Storage Systems", the apparent attractiveness\nof carbonate salts\nwas ascertained.\nThe investigation\nwas extended under a DOE funded NASA\nContract, NAS3-20806, "High Temperature, Molten Salt, Thermal Energy\nStorage System", to identify\ncarbonate salts which could be used for\nspecific\napplications,\nsuch as, in the superheat region of a water-Rankine\ncycle and in the lO00-1600\xc2\xb0F proposed temperature range of solar power\nsystems. The carbonate salts at the low end of the temperature range\n( lO00OF) were evaluated experimentally\nduring Contract NAS3-20806 and\ncandidate carbonates were identified\nfor the upper end of the temperature\nrange.\nThe present effort,\n"High Temperature, Molten Salt-Latent\nHeat,\nThermal Energy Storage Development for Solar Applications",\nDEN3-156, is\na continuation\nof the previous work to select and test latent heat\ncarbonate media, containment materials,\nand thermal conductivity\nenhancement (TCE) materials for high temperature applications\n(1300OF 1600oF) such as advanced solar-thermal\npower generation systems. There\nare three tasks in the present effort:\nmaterial compatibility\ntesting,\nproperty measurements, and reporting.\nThe first\ntask includes the selection\nof six candidate carbonate salts,\nfive containment materials,\nand two thermal conductivity\nenhancement\nmaterials on the basis of thermal performance, cost, and operational\nlifetime.\nCompatibility\nscreening tests of I000 hours and 3000 hours of\nthe salt/containment/TCE\nmaterials will be performed to identify\nthe most\npromi sing combi nations.\n\n21\n\nThis task also includes an evaluation of the effects of using low-cost\ntechnical-grade\nsalts on corrosion of the containment and TCEmaterials,\nand stability\nof the salts themselves.\nThe second task includes the measurement of properties such as thermal\nconductivity,\nheat capacity,\nheat of fusion,\nvolumetric chan_es during\nphase transitions\nand melt temperature.\nMuch of this\'dai_a for\'salts\nin\nthe 1300 to 1600OF temperature range is either unavailable or the data\nthat is available\nis inconsistent.\nThe third task includes the technical,\nschedular, and financial\nreporting.\nUNIVERSITYOF DELAWARE\n(NSG 3184)\nThe University\nof Delaware has a grant "Heat Storage in Alloy\nTransformations"\nNSG 3184 to determine the feasibility\nof using metal\nalloys as thermal energy storage media. The metal alloys have the\nadvantage of having a relatively\nhigh thermal conductivity\nin the solid\nstate compared to other materials being considered as TES media. The high\nthermal conductivity\nresults\nin less resistance to heat transfer to and\nfrom the storage media during charge and discharge portions of the energy\nstorage cycle.\nThe project has four major tasks:\n(I) the identification\nof congruently\ntransforming\nalloys and thermochemical property measurements, (2) the\ndevelopment of a precise and convenient method for measuring volume change\nduring phase transformation\nand thermal expansion coefficients\nduring\nheating and cooling, (3) the determination of materials that can be used\nto contain the metal alloys,\nand (4) analysis of thermal performance and\ncost estimation for selected concepts.\nThe elements selected as candidate media were limited to aluminum, copper,\nmagnesium, silicon,\nzinc, calcium and phosphorus on the basis of low cost\nand high latent heat of transformation.\nSeveral new eutectic alloys and\nternary intermetallic\nphases have been determined.\nA new method employing\nx-ray absorption techniques was developed to determine the coefficients\nof\nthermal expansion of both the solid and liquid phases and the volume\nchange during phase transformation\nfrom data that are obtained during one\ncontinuous experimental test.\nCandidate materials are being evaluated to\ndetermine suitable materials for containment of the metal alloys.\nGraphite has been used to contain the alloys during the volume change\nmeasurements. Silicon carbide has been identified\nas a promising\ncontainment material\nand surface-coated\niron alloys are being considered.\nFinally,\nan effort\nwas recently initiated\nto analytically\npredict the\nthermal performance and estimated cost of two concepts.\nSeveral concepts\nare presently being reviewed to determine the most appropriate concepts\nfor analysis.\n\n22\n\nENGINEERING\nEVALUATION TES MODULES\nOF\nLEWIS RESEARCH ENTER\nC\nNASA-LeRCobtained two prototype TES modules to experimentally\nassess the\npresent state-of-the-art\nof selected concepts.\nThe modules were operated\nto determine factors such as heat transfer\nrates to and from storage, heat\nloss, and long-term operational\ncharacteristics.\nThe first\nmodule\nutilizes\nthe latent heat of fusion of sodium-hydroxide to store off-peak\ngenerated energy which is then used to provide hot water for domestic\nuse. The unit was built by the Comstock and Wescott Companyof Cambridge,\nMassachusetts and uses primarily\nsodium-hydroxide with additives to\ninhibit\ncorrosion of the mild steel containment vessel.\nThis module has\nbeen operated to characterize\nperformance and long term tests were\ninitiated.\nThe second module utilizes\nthe solid-solid\nphase transition\nof\nsodium-sulfate\nto store energy in a dual-media concept.\nThe relatively\ninexpensive sodium-sulfate\nis used to reduce the amount of relatively\nexpensive heat transfer fluid required in the storage module. The module\nwas obtained from the Calmac Manufacturing Corporation of Englewood, New\nJersey.\nThe unit has been operated to determine the performance\ncharacteristics\nof one sodium-sulfate\npebble configuration.\nA second\npebble configuration\nwill be evaluated to determine the effect of pebble\nsize on characteristics\nsuch as heat transfer\nrates and pressure drop.\n\nFigurei0. - Therm-bank lectricwaterheater.\ne\n25\n\nACCOMPLISHMENTS\nNEWCONCEPTS\no Completed MRI assessment of fluidized\nbeds for thermal energy\nstorage subsystems.\nFluidized\nbeds were found to be marginally\ncompetitive for near-term, baseline, industrial\napplications.\nADVANCED EDIA\nM\no\n\nInitiated\nhigh temperature (1300 to 1600OF) carbonate media\nstudy with IGT.

The use of TES can either provide\nconservation through reject energy recovery and reuse or permit a shift\nin\nfuel from oil or natural gas to other non-critical\nfuels.\nOne of the\ngoals of the Department of Ener_\'s\n(DOE) Division of Energy Storage\nSystems is to provide the storage technology capability\nto provide at\nleast 10% of the industrial\nprocess heat or energy requirements of the\nU.S. industry by the year 2000. The purpose of Industrial\nStorage\nApplications\nis to develop TES systems capable of contributing\nto the\nachievement of DOE\'s goal for the year 2000.\nIn order to achieve this long range goal it is clear that in the mid-term\ntime frame (CY 85-90) demonstration of conservation of significant\namounts\nof critical\nfuels is required.\nThe groundwork to do this was started with\nan Energy Research and Development Administration\n(ERDA) funded study to\ndetermine the economic and technical\nfeasibility\nof TES in conjunction\nwith waste heat recovery.\nThis study was directed toward identifying\nindustrial\nprocesses characterized\nby fluctuating\nenergy avail ability\nand/or demand, a key criterion\nfor TES applicability.\nAt least twenty (20) industries\nwere identified\nas areas where thermal\nenergy storage had some potential\nfor application.\nAfter the conclusion\nof this general feasibility\nstudy program, ERDAissued a Program Research\nand Development Announcement (PRDA). This PRDArequested proposals for\nindividual\nstudies of specific\nindustries\nwhich were to be selected by\neach proposer.\nThe overall objective\nwas to identify\napplications\nof TES\nin specific\nindustries\nthrough these system studies, and in subsequent\nwork develop and validate potential\nsystems, demonstrate feasibility\non a\nlarge scale, and then transfer\nthe technology to the total industry to\nobtain widespread implementation.\nAs a result of this PRDA(and after the then recent metamorphosis from\nERDAto DOE) DOE\'s Division of Energy Storage Systems awarded five\ncontracts to study five industries\nwith potential\nsignificant\nenergy\nsavings through the use of TES systems.\nThese industries\nwere paper and\npulp, food processing, steel and iron, cement, and primary aluminum. The\naluminum study produced results that were applicable to district\nheating\nsystems.\nFollow-on work being conducted for district\nheating applications\nis not part of this element.\nThe results\nof these other four studies indicated that within those\nindustries\nthermal energy storage of process and reject heat for\nsubsequent in-plant\nuse appears to be economically and technically\nfeasible\nwith significant\nnear-term conservation benefits.\nPotential\n\n26\n\nannual fuel savings with large scale implementation of near-term TES\nsystems for these industries\nis over 9 x lO%bl of oil.\nThis savings is\ndue to recuperation\nand storage in the food processing industry,\ndirect\nfuel substitution\nin the paper and pulp industry,\nand reduction in\nelectric\nutility\npeak fuel use through in-plant\nproduction of electricity\nfrom utilization\nof reject heat in the steel and cement industries.\nAPPROACH\nFigure II summarizes in a schedular form the major activities\nunder the\nIndustrial\nStorage Applications\nelement.\nLine 1 shows the continuing\nSystem Studies and Supporting Technology activity.\nThis activity\nincludes\nthe PRDASystem Studies, Heat Transport Applications,\nSolar Industrial\nApplications\nand New or Advanced Applications.\nThe PRDASystem Studies\nproduced significant\nresults that were transferred\nto the activities\nof\nLines 2, 3 and 4.

Typically,\nthe base loaded hog fuel boilers with slow\nresponse times are augmented by oil or gas boilers to meet rapid steam\ndemands.

J. HEINZ\nThe food processing application\n(categorj(2)\nis shown in Figurei4.\nUnder\nDOEsponsorship, the Westinghouse Corporation,\nwith the cooperation of the\nH. J. Heinz Company, performed an assessment study to investigate\nthe\napplication\nof Thermal Energy Storage/Waste Heat Recovery (TES/WHR) in the\nfood processing industry.\nThe food processing industry was selected as a\ncandidate industry because it ranked sixth among the nation\'s industrial\nusers in terms of total energy consumption.\nWithin this industry,\nthe\ncanning segments account for a significant\nportion of the industry total.\nThe demand for energy by the canning industry is induced by a variety of\nfood processes and process-related\noperations,\nsuch as, cooking,\nsterilization,\nand clean-up operations.\nOil and natural gas currently\nsupply about 90% of the canning incrustry\'s energy needs. The\nWestinghouse/Heinz study effort\nidentified\nwaste heat sources and\napplications\nin typical\ncanning facilities\nand evaluated TES/WHR\nsystems\nthat would couple the waste heat sources and applications.\nNA_\n\xc2\xa2S-79-2585\n\n{\'HE_-_TTS4RIR_\n\np_,A_Wrlr\n\nVESSELS\n& CLEAN-UP\n(_fl floor)\n\nFROM POWER 8LD.\nBABY FOOD FILLING LIN|\n\nEXHAUST\n\nSTEAM\n\n_EXISTING\nHEAT\nEXCHANGER\nWASTE WATER-_\n\nWATER\nFRESH WATER SUPPLY\n\nFRESH\n\nMOOULE\n\nFigure14.- Thermal nergy toragewaste\ne\ns\n/\nheatrecoveryystem a food\ns\nin\nprocessing\nplant.\n\n3O\n\nA candidate TES/WHR\nsystem application\nwhich was typical\nfor the canning\nindustry was identified\nand evaluated.\nFrom the favorable technical\nand\neconomic results obtained and the potential\nof early commercialization\nwhich would lead to conservation benefits,\na technology demonstration was\nproposed. This system would recover and store waste heat from\npasteurizers,\nsterilizers\nand can and bottle washers which are used in the\nbaby food and canned soup processing operations in the Meat Products\nBuilding at the Heinz Pittsburg\nFactory.\nThese waste water streams are\ncurrently\nsent directly\nto the factory drain system as they emerge from\nthe processes.\nThe proposed system would recover heat energy via heat\nexchangers (to prevent product contamination)to\nheat incoming fresh\nwater.\nThe heated fresh water would be used immediately for process\noperations with the excess being stored in the TES module for clean-up\noperations.\nThe clean-up water requires significant\nenergy input.\nHeinz\nestimates that the factory requires 200,000 gallons of heated\n(150-185OF) water per day which is equivalent to 3-4% of the plant\'s\ntotal energy consumption.\nMajor clean-up is normally performed during the\nthird shift when processing operations are suspended. The use of TES is\nnecessary to match the clean-up requirements with the waste heat supply.\nThis particular\nsystem can be retrofitted\nin the Heinz factory at a\nreasonable cost, is of an appropriate\nsize to serve as an effective\ndemonstration of the technology, and is representative\nof typical\napplications\nwithin the industry.\nIt is estimated that the system will\nrecover 3 x I0 I0 BTU/YR (5000 bbl oil/yr\nequivalent)\nand provide an ROI\nin the range of 35-40%.\nThe proposed technology\nfoll owing tasks:\n\nprogram at Heinz Pittsburgh\n\nI.

The fume stream\nwould charge a solid sensible heat storage packed bed. Discharge of the\nTES system through a heat exchanger would generate steam to drive a\nturbogenerator.\nTES is used to permit electric\npower to be generated\nduring peak demand times instead of continuously.\nThe economic benefits\nto be derived from the use of TES for peak power generation is a direct\nfunction of either a demand charge, time of day pricing,\nor a combination\nof both.\nr+.Ta.l.+378\n\n\'\n\nTO COOLING\nTURBOGENERATOR\n\nTOWER\n\n")"\nCONDENSER\n\nt\n\nOPERATIONAL\nTHERMAL ENERGY\n\nTURBOMIXING\nVALVE\nVALVE,\n\nELECTRIC\nARC\nFURNACES\n\nHEAT EXCHANGER\n\nFAN\n\nMIXING VALVE\nFAN\nBAG\n\nHOUSE\n\nPEAKING THERMAL\nENERGY STORAGE\n\nVALVE\n\nFigure 15. - Steel arc furnace energyrecovery& storagesystem.\n52\n\nFAN\n\nAlthough the TES concept of this study yielded favorable predictions\nof\ncritical\nfuel displacement and investment returns,\nthe approach is not\nready to be applied directly\nto a full scale demonstration without an\ninterim concept development period.\nTherefore, any further work will have\nto be as a result of competition with other applications\nin a similar\nstate of readiness.\nThe cement application\n(category 3) is shown in Figurest6 andl7.\nHot gas\nfrom a long, dry-process cement kiln would be used in a waste heat boiler\nto produce steam for driving\na turbogenerator\nto produce electricity\nfor\nin-process use. Approximately 80-90% of the kiln exit gas would go\ndirectly\nthrough the waste heat boiler with the rest being used to charge\na solid sensible heat storage packed bed.

Lead\nmanagement for drafting\nthe program plan was assigned to LeRC.\nIn April,\n1979, LBRC, SLL, and SERI reached a tentative\nagreement\n(subsequently approved by DOE) whereby SLL would implement major\ndevelopments within the program associated with focused solar thermal\napplications.\nSERI\'s prime responsibility\nwould be applied research of\nthermal storage technologies which provide a base for technology\ndevelopment in high risk areas.\nLeRC agreed to provide overall technical\nand resource program management, including the necessary coordination\nwith\nother aspects of the DOE thermal storage program, planning and preparation\nassociated with program reviews, workshops, multi-year\nplans and annual\noperating plans for both the SLL and SERI activities.\nIn addition,\nLeRC\nwould continue laboratory-scale\ndevelopment of selected storage\ntechnologies\nwhich appeared to be potential\ncandidates for large scale\ndevelopment within the SLL program.\nIt is progress made in these program\nplanning and management activities,\nand related concept developments, that\nis the subject of this section of the report.\nAPPROACH\nThe activities\nwithin this project element can be categorized\n(I) Program Management and (2) TES Concepts Development.\n\nas follows:\n\nProgram Management: A program was established within the term of this\nreport to develop thermal energy storage technologies for a wide range of\nboth large and small solar thermal power system applications.\n(An\nillustration\nof thermal storage integrated\ninto a large solar thermal\nelectric\npower system is presented in Figure 18.)\n\n38\n\nLARGE POWER APPLICATIONS\n\nFigure18.- Solarthermalpower ystems.\ns\nThe objectives\n\nof the program are to:\n\nI. Develop 2nd generation storage subsystems offering\ncost/perform ance improvements.\n2. Establish\n\na techn_logy\n\n3. Provide engineering\ntechnologies.\n\nbase for\n\nsupport for\n\nsubstantial\n\n3rd generation\n\nstorage concepts.\n\nIst\n\nstorage\n\ngeneration\n\nSLL was designated by DOEas lead laboratory for solar thermal\napplications.\nAs such, LeRC provided technical\nand financial\ndirection\nto\nSLL targeted at meeting the first\nand third program objectives.\nPriorities\nwere established which reflect\nboth the current direction\nof\nthe Thermal Power Systems (TPS) Branch, CST, and the projected FY 80\nfunding constraints.\nThis resulted in an initial\nemphasis on\nrepowering/industrial\nretrofit,\ntotal energy, and small community system\napplications.\nCost and performance goals were established for each major\ndevelopment aimed at large electric\npower systems. Procurement packages\nand proposed in-house activities\nwere reviewed for consistency in meeting\nprogram objectives.\nPeriodic reporting\nprocedures were established,\nand\ndraft annual operating plans reviewed prior to their submittal to DOEfor\napproval.\nA number of program overviews were made at both "customer"\ndivision\nprogram reviews and technical\nsociety conferences, describing the\nevolution of the program and the FY 80 implementation thereof.\n\n59\n\nDOE delegated responsibility\nfor meeting the second program objective\nto\nSERI. In the capacity of program manager, LeRC assisted SERI in\nestablishing\na project team to perform systems analyses and technology\nassessments, to conduct research and small-scale\ndevelopment of advanced\nstorage and transport\nconcepts, and to coordinate storage activities\nwith\nlower temperature solar thermal application\nsectors such as agriculture\nand process heat and solar heating and cooling.\nReporting procedures and\noperating plans were established,\nand SERI was funded to conduct an annual\nworkshop, attended by cognizant managers of both TPS and STOR, to critique\nthe overall program plan and FY 80 implementation structure,\nand to\nprovide direction\nand emphasis for FY 81 activities.\nTES Concepts Development: A major problem associated\nthe heat of fusion of molten salts is accumulation of\ndischarge tube surfaces.\nThis accumulation imposes a\nsurface area requirement, which can be the major cost\n\nwith utilization\nof\nsalt deposits on\nlarge heat exchanger\nitem of the system.\n\nTo minimize a potentially\nlarge capital investment in required heat\nexchangers, Honeywell, Inc. and the GrummanAerospace Corporation are\ndeveloping laboratory-scale\nconcepts to enhance energy removal from a TES\nmodule by actively\ninhibiting\nor removing the formation of salt\ndepositions on discharge tube surfaces, (contract\nnos. DEN3-38 and\nDEN3-39, respectively).\nHONEYWELL\nIDEN 3-38)\nHonejavell has completed tests of two active heat exchange experiments and\nhas submitted a draft of the final\nreport for review. The concepts,\ncalled a Coated Tube Flowby experiment and a Direct Contact Reflux Boiler\nexperiment, were identified\nin the conceptual design phase of the study as\nhaving significant\ncost and performance improvement potential\nrelative\nto\na tube-intensive\nlatent heat storage system. The Coated Tube Flowby\nexperiment is based on coating discharge tube surfaces with various\nanti-stick\nmaterials such as nickel,\nchrome, Teflon or Ryton. The Direct\nContact Reflux Boiler experiment is an extension of a current commercial\nprocess, used in the manufacture of sodium nitrate,\nwhereby water is\ninjected directly\ninto the salt melt, vaporized as the salt freezes, and\nthen condensed on discharge tube surfaces.\nA variation\nof the\nexperimental Reflux Boiler module, with continuous salt flow and hydraulic\nheat recovery, is presented schematically\nin Figure 19.\nThe results\nof both concepts were disappointing.\nAlthough qualitative\n\'dip\' tests seemed to indicate that several coatings might alleviate\nthe\nproblem of salt freezing on discharge tube surfaces, tests using an\nelectroless\nnickel coating in the Coated Tube Flowby experiment confirmed\nthat salt adhesion still\nhad a deleterious\neffect on heat transfer\n- to an\nextent which did not warrant further\nconsideration.\nOther coatings such\nas chrome or Teflon were not tested in the Coated Tube Flowby experiment\nbecause of schedular and financial\nconstraints.\n\n4O\n\nThe Reflux Boiler experienced severe salt degradation.\nThe storage\nmedium, (99-percent NaNO, l-percent NaOHby weight) when in contact\n3\nwith water, underwent hydrolysis forming sodium hydroxide and nitric\nacid.\nThis was compounded by an irreversible\nchemical reaction of nitric\nacid with the container walls, forming iron oxides in aqueous solution.\nAs a result,\nonly half the design steam pressure could be achieved in the\nReflux Boiler.\nPLANT\nSTEAM\nOUTLET\n\\\nI\n\n,\n\nSHELL ND\nA TUBE r_\nCONDENSER\n\n_\n\n1\nI\n\nRETURN\nPUMP\n\n/\nFEEDWATER\n-/\n\n"\n.

This module is designed to interface\nwith an\nintermediate heat transport\nloop which uses a liquid metal eutectic as the\nfluid.\nSeparate streams of salt and liquid metal are mixed together in a\nheat exchange column, where, upon discharge, both latent and sensible heat\nare transferred\nto the cooler liquid metal by a countercurrent\nflow of\nmolten salt droplets injected at the bottom of the column, As the salt\nsolidifies,\nit rises to the top of the column, where it is directed over\nthe edge to the bottom of a surrounding tank.\nA schematic of Grumman\'s\nDirect Contact Heat Exchanger, and a photograph of the experimental\ninstallation\nare presented as Figures 20 and 21, respectively.\n\n41\n\nSINK FLUID H/X\nSINK FLUID\n\n_\n\n-\n\n_\n\nIb\n\n4\n\n"\n\nTWO - PHASEFLOW\n\n-\n\n)\n\n]CARRIER\nI\n\n--JL\n\nFLUID\n\nI\nCARRIER\nFLUID\n\n,--_\n\nPUMP (CARRIER FLUID)\n\n,_LID\n_M\nSTORAGE\nTANK\nCOLD\nCARRIER\nFLUID\n\nMOLTEN PCM (DURING STORAG_\nI_,\n\n,U_OE, _\nOUT\n\nSOURCE\nFLUID\n\n1\n\nIN\n\n] _.,-OER\nI\n\nMOLTEN PCM (USAGE)\n\n-I _"\nFigur_ 20\n\nf\nL#_ID\nSTORAGE\nTANK\n\nPUMP\n(PCM)\n\nDIRECTCONTACT\nHEATEXCHANGER\nSYSTEM\nSCHEMATIC\n\nHx\n\nMODULE\n\nLEAD/Bi\nLIQUID I\nMODULE.\n\nFigure21o Directcontactheatexchanger\ninstallation.\n_2\n\nThe second Grummantest module, called a Rotating Drum Scraper, has been\nfabricated.\nBy design, this unit will mate with the existing hardware of\nthe Direct Contact Heat Exchanger experiment, replacing only the central\nheat exchange column. It_uses the same salt storage medium and liquid\nmetal heat transfer\nfluid.\nDuring the discharge cycle, molten salt flows\nthrough Slit nozzles onto the circumference of a rotating\ndrum. At the\nsame time, liquid metal flows through an annular passage within the drum,\ncooling the outer surface and freezing the molten salt.\nThe solidified\nlayer of salt is then scraped off with a fixed scraper blade after the\ndrum has made a particial\n(270 degree) rotation,\nfalling\ninto a storage\nbin where it remains until the next charging cycle.\nCOMSTOCK\nANDWESCOTT\n(DEN 3-138)\n\n_\n\nFirst generation phase change storage systems are typified\nby using\npassive (no moving parts),\ntube intensive\nheat exchangers. The present\ncontract with Comstock and Wescott is a continuation\nof a prior program\nwhich included the design, construction,\nand testing of anexperimental\none-tenth scale-model of a phase change thermal energy storage (TES)\nsystem suitable for use in electricity\ngenerating systems such as the\nSandia Solar Total Energy Test Facility\n(SSTETF) at Albuquerque, New\nMexico. This was used to generate data with which to verifjl a previously\ndeveloped computer model of the TES unit.\nThe TES unit employs a single\npassive internal\nheat exchanger which is used both for charging and\ndischarging heat by means of a non-phase change heat transfer\nfluid such\nas Therminol-66.\nThe TES unit and test bed are described in ref. I.\nThe nominal composition\n\nof the TES medium (Thermkeep) is:\n\nAnhydrous NaOH, commercial grade\nNaNO\n3\nMnO\n2\nThe commercial grade of NaOHtypically\nNa2CO\n3.\nThe present\ntasks:\nI.\n\ncontains\n\nprogaram_which is nearing completion\n\n91.8% (wt)\n8.0\n0.2\nI-2% of NaCI and I-2% of\nincludes\n\nthe following\n\nThe experimental module developed under the prior contract was\nexamined to determine whether or not deterioration\nhas occurred\nduring the testing,\nsuch as mechanical damage to the heat\nexchanger, or chemical changes in the TES medium. \'Figure\n(_J\nshows the heat exchanger in the tank, exposed for examination.\nsignificant\nchanges were observed and it was concluded that no\nrepair was required before proceeding with Task 2.\n\n43\n\nNo\n\nFigure 22. - Passiveheat exchanger.\n\n2. The TES system was restored to operatingconditions,_installation\nof a differentheat transferfluid approved by the NASA Program\nManager, and the running of a series of thermal charging and\ndischargingcycles to obtain additionalexperimentaldata for\ncorrelationwith the computermodel for further validation. From\namong the candidateheat transferfluids, NASA approvedCaloria\nHT-43, a product of Exxon Corporation. Tests included charging\nand dischargingat constant rates, consecutivecycles at constant\ncharge and dischargerates, and cycles simulatinga solar daily\ncycle. This actual performancecompared favorablywith\nperformancepredictedby the conlputerodel.\nm\n3. The computermodel was extended to include a second heat exchanger\nin the TES unit, so that the unit can be charged by means of a\nnon-phasechange fluid (e.g., from solar collectors)flowing in\none heat exchanger,and dischargingby a phase change fluid\nflowing in the other (e.g., the power fluid of a Rankine cycle\nengine).\nSee Figures (23), and (24) for comparison.\n\n44\n\n_ 309C\n\n310C\n\nDISCHARGE\n\n/\n\nHEAT\nTRANSFER\n| FLUID\n242\nC\n\nI\n\n| _\n|\nCHARGE\nI D_\n"--\'-J\nI_\n\nI\n\nEXCHANGER\n\nI\n\nIRANKINE\n\nHARGE\n243\nC\n\nCYCIF\nFLUID\n\nFigure - Schematic\n23.\nof\nsolar\npowered\nelectricity\ngenerating\nstation.\n\n!)10\nC\n\n309C\n\n_\n\nr TESl_NO\nHEAT\n/ EXCHANGER\nSTORAGE\nUNIT\n\nCOLLECTORS\n\nHEAT\nTRANSFER\nFLUID\n\n243\nC\n\nRANKINE\nCYCLEFLUID\n\n_\n\n177\nC\n\nFigure -Advanced heat\n24.\ndual\nexchanger\nsystem.\n\nOne potentialadvantageof the advanced configurationis the\neliminationof the external heat exchanger. A second and more\nimportantadvantageis the potentialimprovementin performanceof\nthe TES unit resultingfrom the fact that during the discharging\nthe temperatureof the Rankine cycle fluid entering the bottom of\nthe TES is much lower than that of the heat transferfluid in the\ncase of the single heat exchanger. A parametricanalysis to be\ncompletedby May, 1980 will hopefullyconfirmthese expectations,\n4. Upon completionof the computermodel a reference design of a\nlowest cost TES system will be developedsuitablefor use in solar\nelectric power generation.\n\n45\n\nNAVALRESEARCHABORATORY\nL\n\nNovel, alternative\nheat exchanger approaches are also being developed and\nsoon to be demonstrated by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The\nobjective\nof the NRL effort\nis to construct,\noperate, and test a I0 foot\ndiameter, 2 MWhdemonstration energy storage tank using about 33 tons of\neutectic salt.\nThe site preparation and design of the facility\nare\ncomplete.\nThe tank is scheduled for completion in the summer of 1980 with\nstorage tests to be completed by the summer of 1981.\nThe basic energy storage boiler tank is shown in Figure 25. It consists\nof a large pressure-tight\ntank in which containers of salt eutectic are\nmounted on racks, largely filling\nthe tank.\n\nWATER\n\nMgCI , NoC|,\n2\nKCl EUTECTIC\nINSULATION\n\nm-TERPHENYL\n\nSO + 02\ne\nFigure25. - Energystorage-boilertank.\n\nThese containers provide a large aggregate area for heat transfer\nintothe\nsalts, which have low thermal conductivity.\nThey also prevent the large\nvolume change in the salt which occurs on freezing to result in large\ncumulative motion, such as would occur if the salt were stored in bulk.\nThe bottom of the tank contains the energy input region.\nAs applied to a\ngas dissociation\nsolar thermal power plant, energy input is effected by\nthe chemical recombination of a work fluid,\nwhich results in production of\nheat.\nAs adapted to a power tower, energy input would likely\nbe provided\nby circulation\nof tower heated Na through the "heat release" tubes.\nIn\nboth cases heat energy is delivered to a pool of "heat pipe" fluid in the\nbottom of the tank, raising\nits temperature and boiling the fluid.\nThe\nresult is an increase in the pressure of heat pipe fluid vapor within the\ntank.\nCondensation of this vapor on the surface of the salt containers\nthen delivers heat to the salt containers, melting the salt.\nEnergy can\nbe stored at nearly constant temperature until all the salt is melted.\nFurther energy input results in a relatively\nrapid increase in tank\ntemperature and pressure.\nWhen all the salt is melted, the full storage\ncapacity of the tank has been utilized.\n_6\n\nThe remainingparts of the energy-storage\nboiler tank relate to energy\nwithdrawal. First there are the boiler-superheater\npipes, which are near\nthe top of the tank. Heat is delivered to these pipes by condensationof\nheat pipe fluid, with energy transportlimited largely by conductivity\nthrough the thin film of condensatewhich continuously\nforms and pours off\nthe pipes. With this type of boiler, steam is produced in direct response\nto feed-waterflow over a large range in demand.\nUnder no-sunlightconditions,operationof the boiler converts heat pipe\nfluid vapor into liquid,lowering the pressure of vapor within the tank.\nReplacementof this vapor is effected by evaporationof heat pipe liquid\nfrom the surfaces of the salt cans. \xe2\x80\xa2To permit this process to continue\nuntil all the salts in the cans are frozen, it is necessaryto keep the\nsalt cans moist with liquid. A liquid circulationsystem is, therefore,\nprovided to continuouslypump liquid heat pipe fluid from the pool at the\nbottom of the tank and to spray the liquid over the salt containers. The\nsurfaces of the containersare wetted by the heat pipe fluid facilitating\nfull film coverageof the cans.\nACCOMPLISHMENTS\no\n\nPreliminarydraft of multiyear programplan, (MYPP),for solar\nthermal applicationsreleased to privatesector for information\nand comment - 4/79\n\no\n\nCost and performancegoals for large solar thermal electric power\nsystems established- 4/79\n\no\n\nSubmittalof SLL and SERI FY 80 annual operatingplans to DOE for\napproval - 8/79\n\no\n\nCompletedrevisedMYPP for DOE approval - 9/79\n\no\n\nComplete laboratoryexperimentsof Honeywell active heat exchange\nconcepts- 12/79\n\no\n\nJoint DOE/CST-STORapproval of MYPP - 1/80\n\no Held solar/storageprogram review - SERI action -2/80\no Recommendedfurther developmentof active heat exchange concepts\nto DOE - 3/80\nISSUES\n\xc2\xb0\n\no None\n\n4_\n\nACTIVITY SCHEDULE\n\n19 79\n\n198_0__\n\n19 81\n\nI\n4.1\n\nPROGRAM\nMANAGEMENT\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\n_, _\n\nTechnical and resource management_\nof Solar Thermal Power Storage\nApplication\nlead lab.activities _\n\n\'\n\nLead lab AOPsubmittal\n\n_\n\no\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nv\n\nto Lead Center\n\ncocsvo\nT I\n\n4.2.1 Laboratory\nstudiesof active\nheat exchangesystems\n(CP: Honeywell)\nDEN 3-38\n\n.......\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.I_\n\n,\n\nF\n-\n\n4.2.2 Laboratory\nstudiesof active\n\n4.2.3 Laboratorystudiesof NaOH\nsystem for solar totalenergy\n(CP: Grumman)DEN 3-39\n(Comstock& Wescott)DEN 3-138\nheat exchangesystems\n\napplications\n\nI\n\n1\n\n!iil\n\n1\nI\n\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nt\n\n!\n\n,\n\nCompleteas planned\n_\'11\n\n_IZ__I_I\n\nI--!__\n_____\n\n,\nL\n\n.,\n\n!\nETransfer\n\n4.2.4 F_brication NRL energy\nof\nstorageboiler tank\n\n1\n\n,.\n\nTechnical and resource management --_--.-of Solar ThermalPower Storage\n_\n....\nresearchlab. activities\n(SERI)\n---+--_-\n\nI.\n\nI\n\nJJ---\n\n$\'\n--\n\nleadcenter/l boratory\na\n_\ni j._. , , ]__ P_T3-_I-L-. l i II I_\' i ]_\n,_\n.... ;\nI [ [ I technicalmanagement [1_{"I-|\nI \'_/I\n;\nI t\xc2\xb0\nI\n\nI.

Because of inherent differences\nin utility\nload generation mix,\ncustomer composition,\nand other factors,\nimplementation of customer-owner\nTES rates will be utility\'specific\nwith regard to the type, magnitude, and\npotential\nmarket penetration for the incentive rates offered.\nIt should\nbe noted that as many as 30 utilities\nare presently offering\nsome form of\nincentive rates for TES residential\ncustomers, and most commercial rate\nschedules already include demand charges which serve as incentives for\nTES. However, there is already a wide divergence between utilities\nin\nboth the type and magnitude of the incentive\nrate structure\noffered.\nSpecific targets\nset include:\n\nfor\n\nutility\n\nI.
