Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA commercial structural epoxy [Super\nKoropon (or equivalent)] has been\nfound to be a suitable filler material for\nbolted joints that are required to have\nlarge thermal conductances. The contact area of such a joint can be less than\n1 percent of the apparent joint area, the\nexact value depending on the roughnesses of the mating surfaces. By occupying the valleys between contact peaks,\nthe filler widens the effective cross section for thermal conduction. In comparison with prior thermal joint-filler materials, the present epoxy offers\nadvantages of stability, ease of application, and \xe2\x80\x94 as a byproduct of its stability\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 lasting protection against corrosion.\nMoreover, unlike silicone greases that\nhave been used previously, this epoxy\ndoes not migrate to contaminate adjacent surfaces. Because this epoxy in its\nuncured state wets metal joint surfaces\nand has low viscosity, it readily flows to\nfill the gaps between the mating surfaces: these characteristics affect the\noverall thermal conductance of the joint\nmore than does the bulk thermal conductivity of the epoxy, which is not exceptional. The thermal conductances of\nmetal-to-metal joints containing this\nepoxy were found to range between 5\nand 8 times those of unfilled joints.\n\nThis work was done by Raymond J.\nLeVesque II; Cherie A.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA simple technique has been devised\nto reduce the number of lead wires\nneeded to connect an array of thermocouples to the instruments (e.g., voltmeters) used to read their output voltages. Because thermocouple wires are\nusually made of expensive metal alloys,\nreducing the number of lead wires can\neffect a considerable reduction in the\ncost of such an array. Reducing the\nnumber of wires also reduces the number of terminals and the amount of\nspace needed to accommodate the\nwires.\nHeretofore, it has been standard practice to use a separate lead wire to connect to each side of each thermocouple.\nIn other words, it has been standard\npractice to use 2N lead wires to connect\nto N thermocouples.\nThe essence of the present technique is to use one common, grounded\nwire for the negative sides of all the\nthermocouples in the array and to connect the positive side of each thermocouple, in the customary manner, to\nthe positive terminal of the instrument\nused to read its output. Fabrication of\nthe array begins with twisting of the single negative-side wire to form branches\nfor thermocouples (see figure).

The\nthermocouples are formed at the tips of the branches.\n\n5\n\nroot of each twisted branch is then\nheated to shunt the twist, thereby reforming the twisted and untwisted portions of the wire into a continuous\npiece of branched wire. Next, thermocouples are formed by joining one end\nof each positive lead wire to the tip of\none of the twisted branches and the\n\nother end to one of the output terminals. If the number of thermocouples\nformed in this way is N, then there are\nonly N + 1 lead wires (the one common\nnegative wire and N positive wires) and\nan equal number of terminals.\nThis work was done by Jon C.

The proposed\nzipper connectors would make it possible to connect and disconnect flexible circuits quickly and easily. Moreover, the flexibility of zipper\nconnectors would make them more\n(relative to rigid connectors) compatible with flexible circuits, so that the\nadvantages of flexible circuitry could\nbe realized more fully.\nLike a conventional zipper, a zipper\naccording to the proposal would include teeth anchored on flexible\ntapes, a slider with a loosely attached\nclasp, a box at one end of the rows of\nmating teeth, and stops at the opposite\nends (see figure). The tapes would be\nmade of a plastic or other dielectric\nmaterial. On each of the two mating\nsides of the zipper, metal teeth would\nalternate with dielectric (plastic)\nteeth, there being two metal teeth for\neach plastic one. When the zipper was\nclosed, each metal tooth from one side\nwould be in mechanical and electrical\ncontact with a designated metal tooth\nfrom the other side, and these mating\nmetal teeth would be electrically insulated from the next pair of mating\nmetal teeth by an intervening plastic\ntooth. The metal teeth would be soldered or crimped to copper tabs.\nWires or other conductors connected\nto electronic circuits would be soldered or crimped to the ends of the\ntabs opposite the teeth.\nThe pitch (that is, the distance\nalong the zipper between mating pairs\nof metal teeth) would be a major consideration in design. It has been esti-\n\n6\n\nSolder Joints\n\nStops\n\nMetal Teeth\n\nPrinted-Circuit Board\nor Flexible Circuit\n\nPlastic\nTeeth\n\nPlastic Slider\n\nClasp\n\nWires\n\nCopper Tabs\n\nCrimp\nConnections\n\nPlastic\nTooth\n\nBox\n\nMetal Tooth\nPlastic Tooth\n\nFlexible Tape\n\nStarting Pin\n\nA Zipper Connector for electronic circuitry would resemble a conventional clothing zipper in several\nrespects.\n\nmated that a pitch of 100 mils (\xe2\x89\x882.5\nmm) can be achieved by known fabrication techniques and that pitches as\nsmall as 25 mils (\xe2\x89\x880.6 mm) may eventually be achievable. Problems that remain to be solved include how to prevent short-circuiting of exposed teeth\nin contact with external electrically\nconductive objects and how to prevent\ncorrosion of the teeth. The short-circuiting problem could be solved by\nadding a dielectric flap that would\n\ncover the teeth. The corrosion problem might be solved by use of gold\ncontacts; the other option would be to\nadd a water-tight seal, but such a seal\ncould reduce or eliminate the advantage of quick and easy connection and\ndisconnection.\nThis work was done by Kevin N. Barnes of\nLangley Research Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA proposed safety system would effect an inhibitory action whenever a\npower tool was aimed in a direction\noutside a prescribed range of allowable\ndirections. The power tool could be a\nwelding torch, blowtorch, laser, drill,\nor gun, for example. The inhibitory action could be turning off the supply of\ngas or electric power to the tool; in the\ncase of a gun, the inhibitory action\ncould be actuation of a mechanical trigger stop.\nThe safety system would include at\nleast two rate-of-rotation sensors (one\nfor pitch and one for yaw), an electronic circuit that would generate an\n\xe2\x80\x9cinhibit\xe2\x80\x9d command, and a mechanism\nthat would effect the inhibitory action\nupon receipt of the \xe2\x80\x9cinhibit\xe2\x80\x9d command. The two rate-of-rotation sensors\ncould be based on gyroscopes and\ncould be combined in a single package;\nthe preferred package would be a commercial dynamically tuned two-axis-gyroscope unit that has a rate range of\n200\xc2\xb0 per second and a steady-state\npower consumption of \xe2\x89\x881 W. The rateof-rotation sensors should be positioned so that their principal axes of\npitch and yaw intersect at approxi-\n\nmately the location designated as the\ncenter of the tool.\nThe figure schematically depicts the\nmain power-control circuit and the\nsafety system as they would be configured in a typical application to an electrically powered tool. Electric power\nwould be supplied to the tool through\nthree switches: a main (manually actuated switch), a safety switch under control by the circuitry described below,\nand a tool-trigger switch. The electronic circuitry in the safety system\nwould include integrators that would\nconvert the outputs of the yaw- and\npitch-rate sensors to yaw- and pitchangle signals, respectively.\nThe yaw- and pitch-angle signals\nwould be fed to the inverting inputs of\nyaw- and pitch-angle-signal comparators, while preset yaw and pitch signals\nwould be fed to the noninverting inputs\nof these comparators. Along with ratesensor-initialization signals, the yawand pitch-angle signals would also be\nprocessed through sample-and-hold circuits, the outputs of which would be\nused to bias the comparators such that\neach comparator would put out a logical \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9d when the corresponding yaw or\n\npitch angle deviated from a desired\naiming direction by more than a preset\namount of yaw or pitch, respectively.\nThe outputs of the comparators\nwould be fed to an inhibitory logic circuit that would allow power to be supplied to the tool when (1) the rate-sensor-initialization signal was asserted, (2)\nthe operator had pressed a \xe2\x80\x9cpower enable/kill\xe2\x80\x9d push-button switch to signal\nthe intention to operate the tool, and\n(3) the tool was aimed within the angular bounds described above. Under all\nother conditions, the inhibitory logic\ncircuit would generate the \xe2\x80\x9cinhibit\xe2\x80\x9d\ncommand, which, in this case, would\ncause the safety switch to shut off power\nto the tool. If the tool were a gas-fed\nwelding torch, then the inhibitory\nmechanism could include an electrically actuated valve instead of (or in addition to) a safety switch. If the tool\nwere a gun, then the inhibitory mechanism could be an electromechanical\ntrigger stop.\nThe sequence of operation of the tool\nand safety system would be the following: The pitch and yaw angular limits\nwould have been preset by the operator.\nThe operator would point the tool at\n\nFlow of Power\nSafety Switch\nPower\nMain Power Switch\nRate-Sensor\nInitialization\nSignals\nInhibitory\nLogic\nCircuit\n\nPower\nEnable/Kill\n\nPreset Pitch\n\nBias\n\nTool\nTrigger\nSwitch\n\nPower\nTool\n\n+\n\xe2\x80\x93\nPitch Signal\n\nSample-andHold Circuit\nPreset Yaw\n\nComparators\n\nBias\n\n+\n\nIntegrators\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\nSample-andHold Circuit\n\nRate-ofRotation\nSensors\n\nYaw Signal\n\nPower To Operate a Tool would be fed through three switches, one of which would be part of the safety system. The safety switch would shut off power\nto the tool, except when the tool was aimed within preset angular bounds and the operator had signaled the intention to operate the tool.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2003\n\n7\n\nthe work site and would assert the ratesensor-initialization signal (this could\nbe done by pressing a push-button\nswitch). The initial orientation of the\ntool would then be \xe2\x80\x9cremembered\xe2\x80\x9d as\nthe desired aiming direction (\xe2\x80\x9choming\xe2\x80\x9d\ndirection). Then the operator would\npress the \xe2\x80\x9cpower enable/kill\xe2\x80\x9d button. Finally, the operator would begin to operate the tool by pulling its trigger. Whenever the tool was aimed outside the\nangular limits, safety system would shut\noff power to the tool.\nUnlike safety systems based on mechanical restraints, the proposed system\nwould not make the operator\xe2\x80\x99s task\nmore difficult or adversely affect the\nquality of the work. Unlike magnetic-\n\n8\n\nand optical-sensor-based safety systems,\nthe proposed system would not require\nthe setup and calibration of an external\nreference subsystem. Unlike an opticalsensor-based safety system, the proposed system would not be susceptible\nto interference by ambient light. In\ncomparison with a magnetic-sensorbased system, the proposed system\nwould be less susceptible to electromagnetic interference. The proposed system is also expected to cost less than\nthe optical and magnetic systems do.\nThe proposed system would have\nsome limitations:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The rate-of-rotation sensors would be\nsensitive to the rotation of the Earth.\nThe rate of buildup of angular error\n\ndue to rotation of the Earth should be\nno greater than about 0.25\xc2\xb0 per minute.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Some drift errors may be generated\nin integration of the outputs of the\nrate-of-rotation sensors. Errors of\nthis type are typically about 1\xc2\xb0 per\nminute.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The system would inhibit operation in\nthe event of translational mispositioning of the tool.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The system would not prevent injury\nto a person who stepped in front of\nthe tool, in a region that fell within\nthe preset angular bounds.\nThis work was done by Larry C. Li of\nJohnson Space Center.

Such\npulse-shaping is desirable and often necessary to obtain bandwidth efficiency in\nvery-high-rate wireless communications\nsystems. In principle, this processing\ncould be implemented in very-largescale integrated (VLSI) circuits.\nWhereas other approaches to digital\npulse-shaping are based primarily on\ntime-domain processing concepts, the\ntheory and design rules of the architectures presented here are founded on\nfrequency-domain processing that has\nadvantages in certain systems.\nA major advantage of parallel processing of signal data, whether for shaping\npulses or other purposes, is that the data\nrate in each of the parallel streams is\nmuch lower than the overall data rate.\nThis makes it possible to use processing\ncircuitry that is slower than what would\nbe needed to process all of the data in a\nsingle stream. In particular, it becomes\npossible to use complementary metal\noxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuitry\ninstead of faster and more expensive\nGaAs-based circuitry. The present frequency-domain approach to parallel\nprocessing offers the following additional advantages:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Certain processing architectures are\narbitrarily scalable, such that filter orders and reductions in processing\nrates can be chosen independently of\neach other without altering FFT-IFFT\nlengths. While this is generally true in\ntime-domain approaches, it has not,\nheretofore, been the case in frequency-domain approaches without altering FFT-IFFT lengths.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Under many circumstances using the\nfrequency-domain approach entails\nfewer computations per filtered output than time-domain counterparts.\nTherefore, fewer transistors and/or\nlower power consumption may result\nfrom such an implementation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The ability to manipulate phase and\nfrequency bands in the frequency-domain approach may have advantages\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2003\n\nin some systems employing time-varying predistortion filtering.\nThe theory and design rules incorporate new and simple subconvolution filtering methods as well as prior developments\nin discrete-time signal processing, multirate filtering, and general linear-systems\ntheory. The theoretical derivation begins\nwith the subdivision of a time-domain convolution into a number of subconvolutions. The subconvolutions are recast as\ncombinations of subsampling (decimation) in parallel, variously delayed streams\nto obtain parallel-processable pairs of specialized discrete Fourier transforms\n(SDFTs) and their inverses (SIDFTs) (see\nfigure). The specialization lies in the elimination of redundant and unnecessary\n\nInput\nx (n)\n4\n\xe2\x80\x941\n\nz\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\ncomputations by (1) skipping over terms\nthat are known to be identically zero and\n(2) exploiting the fact that in the frequency-domain representation of the desired filter response, each negative-frequency component is the complex\nconjugate of the corresponding positivefrequency component. Additional simplifications are made on the basis of the (upsampled) nature of the input signal.\nModularization and expanded parallel operation can be effected by splitting the filtering across multiple blocks.\nThis work was done by Andrew A. Gray of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The piezoelectric audio device\noutperforms many commercially avail-\n\nvice has extremely good audio response (approximately 92\xc2\xb16 dB) in the\nrange of approximately 2\xe2\x80\x9320 kHz with\nvery low voltage required (\xc2\xb18 V). The\ndevice has good sound definition at\nfrequencies less than 1 kHz. The audio\ndevice output is very linear with ap-\n\nlarge-amplitude vibration without\nbreaking. When one piezoceramic\nlayer is used with an applied voltage\nof \xc2\xb125 V, the first bending out-ofplane displacement at the edge has\nbeen measured to be 0.12 in. (3 mm),\nwith the edge 1.0 in. (2.5 cm) away\n\nPiezoelectric\nAudio Device\n\nFigure 1. Piezoelectric Audio Devices can be mounted in headphones, used as speakers, and used inside a cell phone.\n\nable speakers made using speaker\ncones. The piezoelectric device weighs\nsubstantially less (4 g) than the speaker\ncones which use magnets (10 g).\nModalMax devices have extreme fabrication simplicity. The entire audio device is fabricated by lamination. The\nsimplicity of the design lends itself to\nlower cost. The piezoelectric audio device can be used without its acoustic\nchambers and thereby resulting in a\nvery low thickness of 0.023 in. (0.58\nmm). The piezoelectric audio device\ncan be completely encapsulated, which\nmakes it very attractive for use in wet\nenvironments. Encapsulation does not\nsignificantly alter the audio response.\nIts small size (see Figure 1) is applicable to many consumer electronic products, such as pagers, portable radios,\nheadphones, laptop computers, computer monitors, toys, and electronic\ngames. The audio device can also be\nused in automobile or aircraft sound\nsystems.\nThe result of using the ModalMax\ntechniques is a piezoelectric audio device with the audio response shown in\nFigure 2. At 1 cm (sufficient distance\nfor headphones use), the response is\n93\xc2\xb15 dB for 600\xe2\x80\x935,000 Hz, (\xc2\xb14 dB for\nresponse greater than 1 kHz). The de-\n\n10\n\nplied voltage. The device impedance\ndecreases with frequency (3,500 ohms\nat 100 Hz, 83 ohms at 5 kHz and 43\nohms at 10 kHz). ModalMax consists of\nfour methods used to produce highquality sound from a piezoelectric actuator.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mapping Vibration Topography is the\nfirst method used to enhance audio\noutput of piezoelectric devices. During vibration, the cyclic surface deformation produces out-of-plane displacements, the reciprocating strokes\nof which are similar to a piston. Deformation topography that occurs\nduring vibration is measured using a\nlaser vibrometer. The topography is\nused to identify all out-of-plane displacement lines and points having\namplitudes sufficient for driving\nacoustic devices.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tailoring Vibration Response is the second method used to enhance piezoelectric audio output. The center\nphoto in Figure 1 shows a piezoelectric actuator that has been developed\nto have numerous natural frequencies with high out-of-plane displacement amplitudes. The device has a\n\xe2\x80\x9cT\xe2\x80\x9d planform (i.e., throat and crossbar). The throat has a low torsion\nand bending stiffness; yet, can sustain\n\nfrom the mounting line. The out-ofplane displacements for the 743 Hz\nand 426 Hz natural frequencies exceed 0.03 in. (0.76 mm).

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe figure depicts a solar photovoltaic power station in which ultracapacitors, rather than batteries, are used\nto store energy. Developments in the\nsemiconductor industry have reduced\nthe cost and increased the attainable efficiency of commercially available photovoltaic panels; as a result, photovoltaic generation of power for diverse\napplications has become practical. Photovoltaic generation can provide electric power in remote locations where\nelectric power would otherwise not be\navailable. Photovoltaic generation can\nalso afford independence from utility\nsystems. Applications include supplying\npower to scientific instruments and\nmedical equipment in isolated geographical regions.\nThe reasons for choosing ultracapacitors instead of batteries in this power station are the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Batteries are not particularly suitable\nfor storing energy generated in photovoltaic power systems. Batteries must\nbe kept adequately charged, and are\nnot permitted to be completely discharged. The variability of available\nsunlight makes it difficult to satisfy this\nrequirement.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Batteries must be sized to accommodate peak load currents, which are usually much greater than average load\ncurrents.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2003\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Batteries have rather short cycle lives\nand their internal chemical reactions\ncause deterioration over time.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Batteries perform poorly at low temperatures.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ultracapacitors make it possible to\novercome most of the aforementioned\ndisadvantages of batteries.\nThe ultracapacitors in this power\nstation are electrochemical units. Because these capacitors contain largesurface-area electrodes with very small\ninterelectrode gaps, they have large\nvolumetric capacitances. Capacitors\ncan have cycle lives that are extremely\nlong, relative to those of batteries; indeed, it may never become necessary\nto replace capacitors. The longevity of\ncapacitors increases reliability, reduces\n\nlife-of-system costs, and reduces adverse environmental effects. The\nlongevity of capacitors is especially desirable for photovoltaic power systems,\nwhich are kept in service continuously\nfor many years.\nThe power densities of capacitors exceed those of batteries. Therefore, high\npower can be drawn as needed and then\ncapacitors can be recharged very\nquickly in preparation for the next high\npower demand. Capacitors have excellent low-temperature characteristics,\ncontinue to function without need for\nmaintenance, and perform consistently\nover time. In addition, capacitors are\nconducive to safety in that it is easy to\ndischarge them and they can be left\ncompletely discharged.\n\n120-W\nPhotovoltaic\nPanel\n\nSolar Tracker\n\nBank of\nUltracapacitors\n\n300-W, 120-Vac,\n60-Hz Sine Wave\nInverter\n\n120-Vac, 60 Hz\nLoad\n\n120-W\nPhotovoltaic\nPanel\n\nThis Photovoltaic Power Station utilizes ultracapacitors (instead of batteries) as energy-storage\ndevices.\n\n11\n\nThe present power station includes\ntwo 5- by 2-ft (1.5- by 0.6-m) all-weather\nphotovoltaic panels, each rated at a\npower of 120 W. The photovoltaic panels are connected in parallel to provide\nup to 240 W at a potential of 16.9 V. The\nphotovoltaic panels are mounted on a\nsolar tracker for tracking the path of the\nSun to maintain efficiency (at up to 50\npercent more than the attainable efficiency of panels mounted in a fixed orientation). The tracker is a thermally actuated device: it exploits solar heating\nand consequent differential thermal expansion to change the orientation of\nthe panels.\n\n12\n\nThe outputs of the photovoltaic panels are sent to the bank of ultracapacitors for energy storage. Capacitors are\nexcellent for this application in that a\ncomplex voltage regulator is not\nneeded, as it would be if batteries were\nused. The ultracapacitors can tolerate\nvoltage variations up to their maximum voltage rating. The ultracapacitors feed a 300-W, 60-Hz sine-wave inverter for powering various ac loads. A\nsine-wave inverter was chosen to minimize the generation of noise and to\nsupply clean power to the load.\nAdditional photovoltaic panels and\nultracapacitors can easily be added to\n\nsatisfy an increased power demand.\nThe photovoltaic panels and ultracapacitors in this power station have a\nminimum expected life of 25 years.\nThis work was done by Dennis J.

Timing signals are generated from\na central master clock and distributed to\nover 100 users at distances up to 30 kilometers. The time offset due to internal\ndistribution delays and time jitter with\nrespect to the central master clock are\ncritical for successful spacecraft navigation, radio science, and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) applications.\nThe instrument controller and operator\ninterface software is written in LabView\nand runs on the Linux operating system.\nThe software controls a commercial\nmultiplexer to switch 120 separate timing signals to measure offset and jitter\nwith a time-interval counter referenced\nto the master clock. The offset of each\nchannel is displayed in histogram form,\nand \xe2\x80\x9cout of specification\xe2\x80\x9d alarms are\nsent to a central complex monitor and\ncontrol system. At any time, the measurement cycle of 120 signals can be interrupted for diagnostic tests on an individual channel.

The thermal environment of a spacecraft is represented in\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2003\n\nSTEM as consisting of direct solar radiation; short-wave radiation reflected by\nthe atmosphere of the Earth, as characterized in terms of the albedo of the\nEarth; and OLR emitted by the atmosphere of the Earth.

Novel features of STEM include (1) the use of Earth albedo and\nOLR information based on time series\nof measurements by Earth Radiation\nBudget Experiment satellites in orbit;\n(2) the ability to address thermal time\nconstants of spacecraft systems by use of\nalbedo and OLR values representing averages over a range of averaging times;\nand (3) the ability to address effects, on\nalbedo and OLR values, of satellite orbital inclination, the angle between the\nplane of a spacecraft orbit and the line\nbetween the centers of the Earth and\nSun, the solar zenith angle, and latitude.\nThis program was written by Carl G.

Before LVA was developed, in order\nto analyze the structure of a launch vehicle, it was necessary to estimate its\nweight, feed this estimate into a program to obtain pre-launch and flight\nloads, then feed these loads into structural and thermal analysis programs to\nobtain a second weight estimate. If the\nfirst and second weight estimates differed, it was necessary to reiterate these\nanalyses until the solution converged.\nThis process generally took six to twelve\nperson-months of effort. LVA incorporates text to structural layout converter,\nconfiguration drawing, mass properties\ngeneration, pre-launch and flight loads\nanalysis, loads output plotting, direct solution structural analysis, and thermal\nanalysis subprograms. These subprograms are integrated in LVA so that solutions can be iterated automatically.\nLVA incorporates expert-system software\nthat makes fundamental design decisions without intervention by the user. It\nalso includes unique algorithms based\n\non extensive research. The total integration of analysis modules drastically reduces the need for interaction with the\nuser. A typical solution can be obtained\nin 30 to 60 minutes. Subsequent runs\ncan be done in less than two minutes.\nThis program was written by Alan D.\nPhilips of Marshall Space Flight Center.\nLVA contains code modules previously written\nby Carl E.

In the original intended application,\nthe agents would be multiple spacecraft\nand/or robotic vehicles engaged in scientific exploration of distant planets. The\nprogram could also be used on Earth in\nsuch diverse settings as production lines\nand military maneuvers. This program includes a planning/scheduling subprogram of the iterative repair type that reasons about the activities of multiple\nagents at abstract levels in order to greatly\nimprove the scheduling of their use of\nshared resources. The program summarizes the information about the constraints on, and resource requirements\nof, abstract activities on the basis of the\nconstraints and requirements that pertain to their potential refinements (decomposition into less-abstract and ultimately to primitive activities). The\nadvantage of reasoning about summary\ninformation is that time needed to find\nconsistent schedules is exponentially\nsmaller than the time that would be\nneeded for reasoning about the same\ntasks at the primitive level.\nThis program was written by Bradley\nClement, Anthony Barrett, Gregg Rabideau,\nand Russell Knight for Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory.

The task of\ntuning trajectory-determination models\nfor interplanetary navigation is complex,\nrequiring an intensive search of multiple\ndynamical and nondynamical models\nthat yield trajectory solutions with minimal errors. By automating the search,\nADAPT eases the task of human analysts\nand enables them to consider wider\nranges of potential solutions. ADAPT\nuses genetic algorithms to search a\nrange of relevant parameters in a userselected design space to arrive at values\nfor those parameters that best fit the\nmeasured spacecraft-tracking data. The\nuser\xe2\x80\x99s guide for ADAPT reviews the theoretical basis of the program and presents two example applications. One example is that of selecting a\nsolar-radiation model for the Mars\nPathfinder (MPF) mission using MPF\ntracking data and an extended Kalman\nfilter from prior spacecraft-navigation\nsoftware. The second example is of the\nuse of tracking data from the Stardust\n\n14\n\nspacecraft mission combined with a\npseudo-epoch-state batch filter and an\nempirical small-forces model to find improved impulse models for use during\nStardust attitude adjustments.\nThis program was written by Todd Ely of\nCaltech and William Crossley of Purdue University for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

This program creates an advanced user interface that embeds proprietary machine-learning algorithms in\ncommercial image-processing and GIS\nsoftware. A human analyst provides sam-\n\nples of target features from multiple sets\nof data, then the software develops a\ndata-fusion model that automatically extracts the remaining features from selected sets of data. The program thus\nleverages the natural ability of humans\nto recognize objects in complex scenes,\nwithout requiring the user to explain the\nhuman visual recognition process by\nmeans of lengthy software. Two major\nsubprograms are the reactive agent and\nthe thinking agent. The reactive agent\nstrives to quickly learn the user\xe2\x80\x99s tendencies while the user is selecting targets\nand to increase the user\xe2\x80\x99s productivity by\nimmediately suggesting the next set of\npixels that the user may wish to select.\nThe thinking agent utilizes all available\nresources, taking as much time as\nneeded, to produce the most accurate\nautonomous feature-extraction model\npossible.\nThis program was written by David Opitz,\nStuart Blundell, William Bain, Matthew\nMorris, Ian Carlson, and Mark Mangrich of\nVisual Learning Systems, Inc., for Stennis\nSpace Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA composite material consisting of\npolycarbonate filled with copper oxide\nhas been found to be suitable as an antistatic material. This material was developed to satisfy a requirement for an\nantistatic material that has a mass density less than that of aluminum and that\nexhibits an acceptably low level of outgassing in a vacuum.\nPolycarbonate was chosen as the matrix material because it was known to\nsatisfy the low-outgassing requirement.\nCopper oxide was chosen as the electrically conductive filler material in order\nto obtain surface resistivity in the desired static-electricity-dissipation range\n\nbetween about 105 and 1011 ohms per\nsquare. (Materials with lower surface\nresistivities are regarded as conductive;\nmaterials with surface resistivities\ngreater than about 1012 ohms per\nsquare are regarded as insulative and\nthus not suitable for protecting items\nsensitive to electrostatic discharge.)\nA specimen of the copper oxidefilled carbonate material was subjected\nto a parallel-bar-contact surface-resistivity test and a static-discharge test at a\ntemperature of 22 \xc2\xb0C and relative humidity of 50 percent. The specimen was\nfound to have a surface resistivity of 109\n\nohms per square on its rough side and\n1010 ohms per square on its smooth\nside. The time for discharging from a\npotential of 5,000 V to 500 V was measured to be about 0.1 s, and there was\nno measurable charge left after 5 s.\nThese measured characteristics are well\nwithin the acceptable ranges for an antistatic material according to applicable\nNASA and military standards.\nThis work was done by Michael Kovich of\nLockheed Martin Corp. and George R.

Accordingly, the investigation was directed toward determining whether certain combinations of\n(1) refractory alloy compositions, (2)\nVPS parameters, and (3) heat-treatment parameters could result in VPS-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2003\n\nfabricated components with increased\nductility.\nThe table describes five refractory\nmetal alloys that were considered in this\ninvestigation. In each case, during vacuum plasma spraying, the alloy powder\nor corresponding mixture of elemental\nmetal powders was delivered to a plasma\ngun by a flow of argon. The plasma gun\nwas located in a vacuum chamber that\n\nwas evacuated and backfilled with argon\nat a low pressure. The plasma gun generated an argon/hydrogen plasma that\nmelted the powder and projected it toward graphite mandrels, which were rotated so that the VPS deposits would\nform tubes. After plasma spraying, the\ntubes were removed from the mandrels.\nSome of the VPS tubes were subjected\nto heat treatments based on current prac-\n\nAlloy Composition, Weight Percentages\n\nSupplied as Mixture of Elemental Powders (M) or\nas an Alloy Powder (A)\n\n95.5 W, 3.5 Ni, 1.0 Fe\n\nM\n\n60 Mo, 40 Re\n\nM\n\n90 Ta, 10 W\n\nM\n\n75 W, 25 Re\n\nM\n\n99 Nb, 1 Zr\n\nA\n\nThese Refractory Alloys were tested in experiments on fabrication by VPS and heat treatment.\n\n15\n\ntice in the sintering and annealing of conventional powder-metallurgy components.

Both a liquid-phase sinter\n(LPS) and a solid-state sinter (SSS) were\nused on the 95.5W/3.5Ni/1.0Fe alloy. Hydrogen was not used during heat treatment of the 90Ta/10W and 99Nb/1Zr alloys because these alloys are susceptible to\nthe formation of brittle hydrides; instead,\nthese alloys were annealed in vacuum.\n\nStandard metallurgical polishing techniques were used to prepare specimens\nof the as-sprayed and heat-treated tubes\nof each alloy. These specimens were\nthen examined in the as-polished and\netched conditions, by use of an optical\nmicroscope. Quantitative microscopy\nwas used to determine the densities of\nthe specimens.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nCeramic particulate fillers increase\nthe specific strengths and burn resistances of metals: This is the conclusion\ndrawn by researchers at Johnson Space\nCenter\xe2\x80\x99s White Sands Test Facility. The\nresearchers had theorized that the inclusion of ceramic particles in metal\ntools and other metal objects used in\noxygen-rich atmospheres (e.g., in hyperbaric chambers and spacecraft)\ncould reduce the risk of fire and the\nconsequent injury or death of personnel. In such atmospheres, metal objects\nact as ignition sources, creating fire\nhazards. However, not all metals are\nequally hazardous: some are more\nburn-resistant than others are. It was\nthe researchers\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to identify a\nburn-resistant, high-specific-strength\nceramic-particle/metal-matrix composite that could be used in oxygen-rich atmospheres.\nThe researchers studied several metals. Nickel and cobalt alloys exhibit\nhigh burn resistances and are dense\n(ranging from 7 to 9 g/cm3 ). For a\nspace-flight or industrial application in\nwhich weight is a primary concern, the\n\n16\n\nincreased weight that must be incurred\nto obtain flame resistance may be unacceptable. Aluminum and titanium\nare sufficiently less dense that they can\nsatisfy most weight requirements, but\nthey are much more likely to combust\nin oxygen-enriched atmospheres: In\npure oxygen, aluminum is flammable\nat a pressure of 25 psia (absolute pressure \xe2\x89\x88 170 kPa) and titanium is flammable below 2 psia (absolute pressure\n\xe2\x89\x8814 kPa).\nThe researchers next turned to ceramics, which they knew do not act as\nignition sources. Unlike metals, ceramics are naturally burn-resistant. Unfortunately, they also exhibit low fracture\ntoughnesses. Because a typical ceramic\nlacks the malleability, durability, and\nstrength of a metal, ceramics are seldom used in outer-space and industrial\nenvironments. The researchers theorized that a ceramic-particle/metal-matrix composite might provide the best\nof both classes of materials: the burn\nresistance of the ceramic and the tensile strength of the metal. They demonstrated that when incorporated into\n\nsuch low-burn-resistance metals as aluminum and titanium, ceramic particles\nincrease the burn resistances of the\nmetals by absorbing heat of combustion. In the case of such high-burn-resistance metals as nickel and copper, it\nwas demonstrated that ceramic particulate fillers increase specific strengths\nwhile maintaining burn resistances.\nPreliminary data from combustion\ntests indicate that an A339 aluminum\nalloy filled with 20 volume percent of\nsilicon carbide is burn-resistant at pressures up to 1,200 psia (absolute pressure \xe2\x89\x888.3 MPa) \xe2\x80\x94 that is, it has 48\ntimes the threshold pressure of unfilled aluminum. The data show that of\nall the composites tested to date, this\ncomposite has the greatest burn resistance and greatest specific strength\nand is the best candidate for use in oxygen-enriched atmospheres.\nThis work was done by Joel M.

These structures are\ndesigned to be lightweight, to be compactly stowable, and to be capable of\nspringing to stable configurations at full\nextension once released from stowage.\nConceived for use as self-deploying\nstructures in outer space, portable structures of this type may also be useful on\nEarth in applications in which there are\nrequirements for light weight and small\ntransportation volume.\nThe elements common to these structures are spring strips with curved cross\nsections \xe2\x80\x94 similar to spring strips of the\ntype commonly used as compactly stowable carpenters\xe2\x80\x99 measuring tapes. These\nstructures exploit the nonlinear mechanical properties of such tapes,\nnamely (1) strong resistance to axial\nbuckling while they are straight and (2)\nease with which they can be wound into\ncompact rolls once they have been initially bent. For a structure that contains\nmultiple such strips, the net effect of the\ncombined nonlinear characteristics is\nthe following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 When at full extension, the structure is\nin a stable state, in which it is rigid and\nstrong.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 When stowed compactly, the structure\nis in a state that is semistable in the\nsense that only a small force is needed\nto restrain the structure against deployment.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The strain energy stored in the spring\nstrips during compaction is sufficient\nto deploy the structure to full extension when the restraint is removed.\nThe figure depicts two of several\nboom designs that have been investigated thus far. One design calls for several longitudinal spring strips with\ncurved cross sections as described\nabove, connected at intervals by semicircular circumferential spring strips\nwith flat extensions. The main advantage of this design is relative strength;\nthe main disadvantages are the additional weight and volume of the flat extensions and the potential for motion\nof the flat extensions to cause damage\nduring deployment.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2003\n\nAnother design features semicircular circumferential spring strips joined\nby fibrous hinges. The main disadvantage of this design is less strength, relative to the design described above;\nthe main advantages are less weight\nand volume as well as greater safety\nduring deployment. Still other designs\nfeature, variously, circumferential\n\nspring strips with self-locking hinges,\nand deployment control devices to reduce deployment speeds.\nThis work was done by Houfei Fang,\nMichael Lou, and Nathan Palmer of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nNPO-30175\n\nLongitudinal Spring Strips\nWith Curved Cross Sections\nSemicircular\nCircumferential\nSpring Strips With\nFlat Extensions\n\nSemicircular Circumferential Spring\nStrips Joined by Fibrous Hinges\n\nSpring-Strip Booms are made of longitudinal spring strips with curved cross sections (similar to carpenters\xe2\x80\x99 measuring tapes) connected with circumferential spring strips.\n\n17\n\nManufacturing\nExplosion Welding for Hermetic Containerization\nThere is no need to decontaminate the outside of the container.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nHazardous\nEnvironment\n\nClean\nEnvironment\n\nSample\nSample\n\nDouble-Walled\nContainer\n\nExplosive\n\nHazardous\nEnvironment\n\nClean\nEnvironment\n\nSample\nSample\n\nHazardous\nEnvironment\n\nClean\nEnvironment\n\nA container designed for storing\nsamples of hazardous material\nfeatures a double wall, part of\nwhich is sacrificed during an explosion-welding process in which\nthe container is sealed and transferred to a clean environment.\nThe major advantage of this container sealing process is that once\nthe samples have been sealed inside, the outer wall of what remains of the container is a clean\nsurface that has not come into\ncontact with the environment\nfrom which the samples were\ntaken. Thus, there is no need to\ndevise a decontamination process\ncapable of mitigating all hazards\nthat might be posed by unanticipated radioactive, chemical,\nand/or biological contamination\nof the outside of the container.\nThe container sealing method\nwas originally intended to be\nused to return samples from Mars\nto Earth, but it could also be used\nto store samples of hazardous ma-\n\nSample\n\nterials, without the need to decontaminate its outer surface.\nFigure 1 depicts the process stages.\nIn its initial double-wall form, the volume between the walls is isolated from\nthe environment; in other words, the\nouter wall (which is later sacrificed)\ninitially serves to protect the inner\ncontainer from contamination. The\nsample is placed inside the container\nthrough an opening at one end, then\nthe container is placed into a transfer\ndock/lid.

A procedure has also been developed at Ames that effectively sharpens\nthe multiwalled nanotube, which improves the resolution of the multiwalled\nnanotube probes and, combined with the\ngreater stability of multiwalled nanotube\nprobes, increases the effective resolution\nof these probes, making them comparable\nin resolution to single-walled carbon nanotube probes. The robust attachment de-\n\n20\n\nrived from this improved fabrication\nmethod and the natural strength and resiliency of the nanotube itself produces\nan AFM probe with an extremely long\nimaging lifetime. In a longevity test, a\nnanotube tip imaged a silicon nitride surface for 15 hours without measurable loss\nof resolution. In contrast, the resolution\nof conventional silicon probes noticeably\nbegins to degrade within minutes. These\ncarbon nanotube probes have many possible applications in the semiconductor\nindustry, particularly as devices are approaching the nanometer scale and new\natomic layer deposition techniques necessitate a higher resolution characterization technique. Previously at Ames, the\nuse of nanotube probes has been demon-\n\nstrated for imaging photoresist patterns\nwith high aspect ratio. In addition, these\ntips have been used to analyze Mars simulant dust grains, extremophile protein\ncrystals, and DNA structure.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nFigure 1 depicts some aspects of an\napparatus and method for automated\nserial sectioning of a specimen of a solder, aluminum, or other relatively soft\nopaque material. The apparatus includes a small milling machine (micromiller) that takes precise, shallow\ncuts (increments of depth as small as 1\n\xc2\xb5m) to expose successive sections. A microscope equipped with an electronic\ncamera, mounted in a fixed position on\nthe micromiller, takes pictures of the\nnewly exposed specimen surface at\neach increment of depth. The images\nare digitized, and the resulting data are\nsubsequently processed to reconstruct\n\nthree-dimensional (3D) features of the\nspecimen.\nThe micromiller includes a threeaxis (x,y,z) translation table. The specimen remains mounted on the translation table during all phases of the\nsectioning process, including etching\nand imaging in addition to milling. All\nmotions of the table during the sectioning process take place under computer control. Thus, to index to the\nnext increment of depth, the table is\ntranslated the corresponding short distance along the z-axis. The translation\ntable is also used to move the specimen\nalong the y-axis from the milling posi-\n\nMilling Cutter\n\nCamera\n\nSpecimen in\nMilling Position\nMicroscope\nLamp\nSpecimen in\nEtching Position\nSpecimen on\nTranslation Table\n\nSpecimen in\nImaging Position\n\nLVDT\n\nFigure 1. A Specimen on a Translation Table is moved along the y-axis among milling, etching, and\nimaging positions. With the help of the LVDT, the corrections for small y-axis misalignments of imaging positions can be made during processing of image data.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2003\n\ntion to an intermediate etching position, then to the imaging position,\nthen back to the milling position for\nthe next cut.\nThis method affords advantages over\na related prior method in which a specimen was repeatedly cut on a micromiller, then dismounted, etched,\nphotographed through a microscope,\nthen remounted on the micromiller\nfor the next cut. One advantage is elimination of much of the positioning uncertainty, and hence the uncertainty in\nregistration of features seen at different depths, that arises from repeated\nmounting, dismounting, and photographing at a location different from\nthe milling location.\nAnother advantage is automation of\nalignment of the images acquired at different depths. In the prior method, images were aligned, after they were\nrecorded, in a procedure that was at\nleast partly manual and hence timeconsuming. In the present method,\nalignment is performed as an integral\npart of processing of the image data.\nInasmuch as tests have shown that\nthere is no measurable undesired\ntranslation of the specimen along the\nx -axis, the alignment problem involves\nmainly compensating for any error in\nreturning the specimen, on each cycle,\nto the same nominal y coordinate for\nimaging. Measurements have shown\nthat the actual y coordinate used for\nimaging on a given section can deviate\nfrom the nominal position a distance\nof the order of 50 \xc2\xb5m. In the present\nmethod, during imaging, the y coordinate of the specimen is measured by\nuse of a linear variable-differential\ntransformer (LVDT) accurate to within\n0.5 \xc2\xb5m. Then during processing of the\nimage data as described in the next\nparagraph, the measured y coordinate\nof imaging position for each section is\nused as an offset to translate the image\nin y to the nominal position.\nOnce the image data from all sections\nhave been recorded, they can be\nprocessed by readily available imagedata-processing software, then combined to construct digital representa-\n\n21\n\nFigure 2.

As a\nresult of automation of the sectioning\nprocess, it is now possible to take about\n20 sections per hour from given specimen, whereas previously, at most 10 sections could be taken in a day.\nThis work was done by Jen Alkemper\nand Peter W.
