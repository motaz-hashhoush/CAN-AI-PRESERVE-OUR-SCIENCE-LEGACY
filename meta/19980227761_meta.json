First, this document defines the core products and activities required of NASA software projects. It defines life-cycle models and activity-related methods but acknowledges that no single life-cycle model is appropriate for all NASA software projects. It also acknowledges that the appropriate method for accomplishing a required activity depends on characteristics of the software project. Second, this guidebook provides specific guidance to software project managers and team leaders in selecting appropriate life cycles and methods to develop a tailored plan for a software engineering project.", "title": "Software Program: Software Management Guidebook", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T22:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19980227761, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980227761, "id": "daeb2c1708a04e4fa2aab7bd36276cb1", "publicationDate": "1996-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980227761.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980227761/downloads/19980227761.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980227761/downloads/19980227761.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980227761/downloads/19980227761.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
