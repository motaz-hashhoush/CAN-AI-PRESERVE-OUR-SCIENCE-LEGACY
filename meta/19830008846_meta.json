This contract included a requirement for Boeing to form an Industrial Technical Advisory Board (ITAB), with members representing major aerospace and computer companies. The purpose of this board was to guide the development of IPAD. The specific goal of IPAD is to increase United States aerospace industry productivity through the application of computers to manage engineering data. This goal clearly is attainable; in fact, IPAD's influence can reach beyond the aerospace industry to many businesses where product development is based on the design-building process. An enhanced IPAD, therefore, is a national asset of significance. The role of ITAB in guiding the development of this system is described.", "title": "Industry involvement in IPAD through the Industry Technical Advisory Board", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T19:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830008846, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Swanson, W.
