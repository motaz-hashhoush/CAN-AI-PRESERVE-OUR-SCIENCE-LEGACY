We sought out to establish the feasibility of using a large inflatable drag device to decelerate and land on Pluto from interplanetary speed (~14 km/s) using only the Pluto atmosphere and just a few kilograms of propellant. The design and analysis efforts in Phase I indicated that this is feasible. Aerodynamic heating and loads were found to be orders of magnitude less than typical planetary entries due to the ultra-low ballistic coefficient craft and the low density and large scale height of the Pluto atmosphere. The deceleration system is capable of delivering a 200-kg lander-hopper to the surface or inserting an orbiter of a similar mass using aerocapture. Mission analysis work led to a reference mission with Earth launch in 2029, Jupiter assist in 2030, and Pluto arrival in 2040.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180007811, "id": "2fa0a7b4b072438aad762ae5e97c04e4", "publicationDate": "2018-02-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180007811.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180007811/downloads/20180007811.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180007811/downloads/20180007811.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180007811/downloads/20180007811.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
