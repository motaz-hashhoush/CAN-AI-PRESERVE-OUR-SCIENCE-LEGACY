b'ISS Microgravity Environment\nMichael R. Laible\nBoeing, International Space Station, Loads and Dynamics\n13100 Space Center Blvd\nHouston, TX 77059\nThe Microgravity performance assessment of the International Space Station (ISS) is\ncomprised of a quasi-steady, structural dynamic and a vibro-acoustic analysis of the ISS\nassembly-complete vehicle configuration. The Boeing Houston (BHOU) Loads and\nDynamics Team is responsible to verify compliance with the ISS System Specification\n(SSP 41000) and USOS Segment (SSP 41162) microgravity requirements. To verify the\nISS environment, a series of accelerometers are on-board to monitor the current\nenvironment.\nThis paper summarizes the results of the analysis that was performed for the Verification\nAnalysis Cycle (VAC)-Assembly Complete (AC) and compares it to on-orbit\nacceleration values currently being reported. The analysis will include the predicted\nmaximum and average environment on-board ISS during multiple activity scenarios.\n\n'
