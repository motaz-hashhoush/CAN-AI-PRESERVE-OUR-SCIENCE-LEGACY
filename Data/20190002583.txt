At the time of this writing, SpaceX has completed 14 missions to ISS with each returning to Earth via water landing. After each mission, a team from the\nNASA Johnson Space Center performs an inspection of the exterior surfaces of the Cargo\nDragon spacecraft for hypervelocity impact damage features. Data from these inspections are\ncollected into a database that includes impact feature dimensions as well as the location on the\nvehicle. Additional details on the type and size of particle that produced the damage site are provided when sampling data and definitive spectroscopic analysis results are available. Observation\ndata can be compared with impact estimates from risk assessment codes as a check on the micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) environment predictions.\nScope\nA general description of the spacecraft and its thermal protection system will be provided. Mission details such as exposure duration and launch dates are also planned. The paper\nwill document the general inspection procedure for collection of data and the post inspection data\nanalysis process. It will also provide details on the observation data collected to date as well as\n\n-1-\n\nthe number of intact samples collected for spectroscopic analysis to discern the source of the impacting particle. A comparison between observed impacts and the expected number of damage\nfeatures calculated by Bumper 3 will also be presented.\nFindings\nStatistics on the 223 impact features documented in the database will provide insight into\nthe depth to diameter ratios and other relationships. The quality of the comparion between the\nobservations and code predictions are dependant on several factors. The paper will discuss of\neach of these variables.\n(1) Damage equations\n(2) Impact condition assumptions\na. Projectile density\nb. Impact speed\nc.

Two of the three companies in the upcoming Commercial Resupply Services\n(CRS 2) contract for ISS, SpaceX and Sierra Nevada Corporation will have reusable vehicles\nthat present additional opportunities for post flight MMOD inspections.\n\n-3-\n\n'
