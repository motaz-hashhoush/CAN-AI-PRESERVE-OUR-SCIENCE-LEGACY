NASA asked\nthat the study also consider how these applications would influence or be\nin.=luenced by the Space Shuttle System, the principal space transportation\nsystem of the 1980 1 s. In Decc:mbe \xe2\x80\xa2r 1973, the Academy agreed to perform the\nstudy and assigned the task to the Space Applications Board (SAB).\nIn the summers of 1967 and 1968, the National Academy of Sciences had\nconvened a group of eminent scientists and engineers to determine what research\nand development was necessary !o pf:rmit the exploitation of useful applications\nof earth-oriented satellites. 1-ne SAB concluded that since the NAS study,\noperational weather and communications satellites and the successful first\nyear of use of the experimental Earth Resources \'Technology Satellite had\ndemonstrated conclusively a technological capability that could form a foundation for expanding the useful applications of space-derived information and\nservices, and that it was now necessary to obtain, from a broad cross-section\nof potential users, new ideas and needs that might guide the development of\nfuture space systems for practical applications.\nAfter discussions with MASA and other interested federal agencies, it was\nagreed that a major aim of the "summer study" should be to involve, and to\nattempt to understand the needs of, resource managers and other decision-makers\nwho had as yet only considered space systems as experimental rather than as\nuseful elements of major day-to-day operational information and service systems.\nUnder the general direction of the SAB, then, a representative group of users\nand potential users conducted an intensive two-week study to define user needs\nthat might be met by information or services derived from earth-orbiting satellites. This work was done in July 1974 at Snowmass, Colorado.\nFor the study, nine user-oriented panels were formed, comprised of present\nor potential public and private users, including businessmen, state and local\ngovernment officials, resource managers, and other decision-makers. A number\n\n*Effective July 1, 1974, the National Academy of Sciences and the National\nAcademy of Engineering reorganized the National Research Council into eight\nassemblies and commissions. All National Academy of Engineering program units,\nincluding the SAB, became the Assembly of Engineering.\niii\n\nof scientists and technologists also participated, functioning essentially\nas expert consultants. The assignment made to the panels included reviewing\nprogress in space applications since the NAS study of 1968* and defining user\nneeds potentially capable of being met by space-system applications. User\nspecialists, drawn from federal, state, and local governments and from business\nand industry, were impaneled in the following fields:\nPanel 1: Weather and Climate\nPanel 2: Uses of Communications\nPanel 3: Land Use Planning\nPanel 4: Agriculture, Forest, and Range\nPanel 5: Inland Water Resources\nPanel 6: Extractable Resources\nPanel 7: Environmental Quality\nPanel 8: Marine and Maritime Uses\nPanel 9: Materials Processing in Space\n-In addition, to study the socioeconomic benefits, the influence of technology, and the interface with space transportation systems, the following\npanels (termed interactive panels) wers convened:\nPanel\nPanel\nPanel\nPanel\nPanel\n\n10:\n11:\n12:\n13:\n14:\n\nInstitutional Arrangements\nCosts and Benefits\nSpace Transportation\nInformation Services and Information Processing\nTechnology\n\nAs a basis for their deliberations, the latter groups used needs expressed\nby the user panels. A substantial amount of interaction with the user panels\nwas designed into the study plan and was found to be both desirable and necessary.\nThe major part of the study was accomplished by the panels. The function\nof the SAB was to review the work of the panels, to evaluate their findings\nand to derive from their work an integrated set of major conclusions and recom-menuations. The Board\'s findings, which include certain significant recommendations from the panel reports as well as more general, ones arrived at by\nconsidering the work of the study as a whole, are contained in a report prepared by the Board.**\nIt should be emphasized that the study was not designed to make detailed\nassessments of all of the factors which should be considered in establishing\npriorities.

In some cases, analyses of costs and benefits will be n\nneeded. In this connection, specific cost-benefit studies were not conducted\nas a part of the two-week study. Recommendations for certain such analyses,\nhowever, appear in the Board\'s report, together with recommendations designed\nto provide an improved basis upon which to make cost-benefit assessments.\nIn sum, the study was designed to provide an opportunity for knowledgeable\nand experienced users, expert in their fields, to express their needs for\ninformation or services which might (or might not) be met by space systems,\nand to relate the present and potential capabilities of space systems to t\ntheir needs. The study did not attempt to examine in detail the scientific,\ntechnical, or economic bases for the needs expressed by the users.\nThe SAB was impressed by the quality of the panels\' work and has asked\nthat their reports be made available as supporting documents for the Board\'s\nreport. While the Board is in general accord with the panel reports, it\ndoes not necessarily endorse them in every detail.\nThe conclusions and recommendations of this panel report should be considered within the context of the report prepared by the Space Applications\nBoard.

processing of the data acquired, and actual utilization in the field of remotely sensed information. Thus, the group was multidisciplinary in terms of the technology involved, the application of such\ntechnology, and the perception of the future utilization of remote sensing in\nland use planning.\nThe approach included interaction with the advisory resource persons, the\ntechnology team, the interactive panels, and representatives of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the J.S. Geological Survey (USGS),\nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the European Space Research\nOrganization (ESRO) who were present at the study. The first phase of the study\nevaluated ideas, applications, and future opportunities. The second phase isolated those areas in which further information and definition were required. in\nthe third phase, user requirements were developed in accordance with the Space\nApplications Board\'s plan for the Summer Study and findings and recommendations\nwere formulated as a basis for further discussion and development by the Space\nApplications Board.\nThe objectives of the Panel were to:\nDefine the land use planning discipline,\nDefine the current state-of-the-art as it may make use of information obtained by remote sensing,\nPresent a 5- to 15-year scenario for the impact of remote sensing\nfrom air and space platforms on land use planning, and\nIdentify crirical factors in the applications of remotely sensed\ndata to land use planning.\nThe Panel conducted its deliberations from the viewpoint of operational\nusers at the local, regional, state ; and federal levels. The Panel believes\nthis differs from that of previous studies in which the definition of user needs\nwas apparently based primarily on outputs from principal investigators drawn\nfrom the research and development community.\nI\n\nI\n\nContained in the report are the Panel\'s views on progress since the study\nof practical uses of space systems conducted by the National Academy of Sciences\nin 1967-68, the utility of remote sensing, user requirements, users\' educational\nneeds, a review of technical requirements, some information on costs and benefits,\nand summaries of case studies of three states \xc2\xbb- Colorado, California, and Alaska,\n\nDEFINITION OF LAND USE PLANNING\nLand use planning is defined as planning for the allocation of activities\nto land areas in order to benefit humans. The discipline involves three sets\nof tasks as follows:\nForecasting requirements or demands for goods and services,\nEstimating the supply of land available to produce these goods\nand services (in terms of amount, location, quality, suitability,\nor capability), and\nEvaluating, implementing, and monitoring alternative management\nand control strategies.\nLand use planning deals with all possible uses, including urban (residential,\ncommercial, industrial, institutional), transportation, agriculture, forestry,\nmining, and outdoor recreation. The Panel on Land Use Planning has attempted, in\npreparing this report, to adopt as broad a view as possible of the land use planning process.\nAll three of the tasks listed above have substantial information requirements which may be satisfied by remote sensing. For example, information derived\nfrom remote sensors is potentially useful in the first task area to calibrate\nmodels which forecast growth pattern by extrapolation. In the third task area,\nplanning decisions which have spatial implications (such as assessing the impact\nof urbanization on critical environmental areas) are more easily monitored by\nsatellite than by conventional ground checks. Investigators for the Earth\nResources Technology Satellite (ERTS-1, since renamed LANDSAT-1) have demonstrated\nthis capability. However, the most significant potential contribution of remote\nsensing will be in the second task area. We believe that the principal element\nin future land use planning will be evaluation of the available land resources.\nThis task is particularly difficult because current information-gathering techniques result in incomplete coverage, inappropriate scale, poor reliability, or\nuntimeliness (because of inherent lags in the information-gathering process).\nRemotely sensed information may provide significant augmentation of more conventional methods.\n\nTHE PLANNING PROCESS\nThe methods by which planning decisions should be made involves the following steps:\nDefinition of the problem\n\n2\n\nAcquisition of data relevant to the problem\nEstablishment of goals and policies\nImplementation of a specific plan of action\nEvaluation and monitoring of progress through the plan toward\nthe goals.\nThe Panel believes that the problem of acquiring relevent data is currently\nthe limiting factor in land use planning. In the experience of the Panel members,\nthe difficulties in acquiring adequate data are such that the succeeding steps in\nthe land planning process (establishment of goals and policies, and implemention\nof specific plans of action) are often based on imperfect information, and the\nfinal step (evaluation and monitoring of progress toward the goals) is done\nonly superficially. A supply of remotely sensed imagery may reduce the amount\nof effort devoted to data acquisition and allow more resources to be applied and\nrational decisions made in the later stages in the planning process.\nA flow of remotely sensed imagery might also help to pace the planning process, since problem \'dentification can be established as a responsibility of the\nplanning agency to be carried out on a regular basis as remotely sensed data are\nreceived.\nPARTICIPANTS IN LAND USE PLANNING\nThe participants in land use planning (and, therefore, the potential users\nof remote sensing-derived information) are as follows:\nEntrepreneurs (individual and corporate)\nElected and appointed officials\nCitizen groups\nProfessional planners in private and public service\nEducators (through their training of planners)\nResearchers (through their study of planning techniques).\nMost of these participants regularly use images from aerial photography.\nSome individuals in the last three groups are familiar with multispectral scanning (MSS) and the characteristics of space images. Professional planners, particularly at the federal and state levels, are becoming increasingly interested\nin these data. College teachers of geography, geology, ecology, forestry, natural resources, conversation, and similar subjects studied by planning students\nare increasingly incorporating discussions of remotely sensed imagery into their\npresentations. At the graduate level, however, planning curricula tend to be\nbased on the social sciences, and remote sensing and space imagery axe little\n\n3\n\ni\n\nused or understood. The Land use planning research community is not \t\nous group but is scattered throughout several disciplines. To date,\ngeographers who have been primarily interested in studying the potent.\ncations of xemote sensing and space imagery in land use planning.\n\n\'ne-\n\nPROGRESS SINCE 1967-68\n\nSince the summer study on space applications in 1968, there have been many\ndevelopments which are important to land use planning. The number of problems has\nincreased, important federal and state laws have been passed, and the technology\nof data collection and processing has advanced, This section presents and discusses these developments.\nREVIEW OF 1968 STUDY\nThe report of the Forestry-Agriculture-Geography Panel* of the 1968 summer\nstudy was reviewed to assess the adequacy of the study recommendations for\nmeeting present and future needs, and the nature and extent of government, industry, and user response to study recommendations.\nThe 1968 report recommended two programs: one short-range program, Global\nLand Use (GLU), and one long-range program, System for Earth Resources Information\n(SERI). Both used data from a polar orbiting spacecraft. GLU was intended to\nbe a 4-year program and SERI an operational program after a 12-year development\neffort.\nGLU was intended as a global collection and dissemination system for land\nuse information. The 1968 study panel postulated a data collection system with\na synoptic view and output capable of pho*ointerpretation as well as computer\nprocessing. The collection system was to be modest to facilitate its acceptance\nand to encourage development of favorable international policy and thus pave the\nway for more complicated systems to follow.\nSERI was conceived as a considerably more complicated system, employing GLU\nas well as other data sources and concentrating on providing data for agriculture,\nforestry, and land use planning. The structure conceived for SERI is very similar\nto that of information systems that employ remote sensing input today.\nIn the context of the situation today, the 1968 program recommendations need\nreview because:\n\nEarth-Oriented Satellites:\nReport of the Panel on ForestxV-Agriculture-Geography, (Panel. 1). National\n\n*National Research Council. Useful Applications of\nAcademy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., 1969, p. 4.\n5\n\ni\n\nThe development of the land use planning function at the state\nlevel has increased rapidly (driven mainly by state and some\nfederal legislation);\nPublic awareness of environmental quality and land use issues\nhas increased natius.wide so that the information requirements\nfor land use planning have become more detailed than they were\nat the time of the 1968 study;\nIt may be difficult for foreign countries to accept international\nland use information programs of the complexity of SERI for\nseveral reasons --- perhaps mainly because of fear of exploitation\nby outside interests more able to use the land resource data than\nthe country surveyed; and\nIncreasing emphasis on estimates of benefits achieved in domestic\napplications to justify further space program expenditures may\nforce concentration of work on domestic applications in order to\nmore precisely define the cost-benefit picture.\n\nDEVELOPMENTS IN LAND USE PLANNING\nIn 1968, planning was primarily concerned with the internal organization of\n;ties (particularly for redevelopment) and the provision of regional services\nsuch as transportation. While these are still central tasks, there have been\nadded a strong concern for the environmental consequences of growth and a spread\nin responsibility and interest to the local or neighborhood level and to the state\nand federal level. No corresponding change has occurred in the use of remote\nsensing data in lend use planning during this period. In the 1968 study, no\npanel was primarily devoted to land use planning. This activity was covered by\nthe Forestry-Agriculture-Geography Panel. Little information on land use planning\nhas appear in published reports or research done in the applications of remote\nsensing since then. Ho ,.,:4ver, considerable work has been done by investigators\nin the discipline of geography on such topics as land use mapping -- which is\npotentially useful in planning. Land use planners have remained, in effect,iin\nthe research and development phase, in which disciplinary research is done to\nprovide the basis for an operational mode yet to come. This situation is illus\ntrated by Figure I, which also suggests the possible future trenu.\nIn Figure I, the size of the remote sensing circle is intended to portray\nwhat we feel was, is, and will be the size of the national remote sensing effort.\nThe changing no5ition and overlap of the remote sensing circle with the geographers\'\nand land use planners\' circles is intended to portray the relative impact of remote\nsensing on the activities of these two groups of people. It also indicates the\nchange of the remote sensing effort from research and development (impact on\ngeographers) to operational (impact on land use planners). We do not mean to\nimply, by the portions of the remote sensing circles overlappins, the geographers\'\nand land use planners\' circles, a suggested size of the land use planning effort\nwithin the national remote sensing program.\n\n6\n\nFIGURE I THE TREND IN USE OF REMOTELY SENSED\nDATA FOR LAND USE PLANNING BY GEOGRAPHERS\nAND LAND USE PLANNERS\n\n7\n\nLEGISLATION\nSignificant legislation has been passed and proposed in the land use and\nassociated environmental fields since 1968. One effect on the land use planning\ndiscipline has been a need for a more complete inventory and analysis of resources\nand uses. Another is the need for coordination of all land use associated activities on a state, regional, and local basis, and closer control and monitoring of\nall uses in both urban and rural areas.\nSome of the land use legislation that has been enacted since 1968 follows:\nYear\t\n\nLegislation\n\n1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); Oregon Land Use\nPlanning Act SB_l\n1970 California Environmental Quality Act; Maryland Wetlands Act;\nMichigan Shorelands Protection and Management Act; California\nState Planning Act AB-2070\n1971 Vermont Act 250; Delaware Coastal Zone Act; Alaska Native\nClaims Settlement Act; State of Alaska Land Use Planning\nCoordination Act\n1972 California Coastal Zone Conservation Act; Federal Coastal Zone\nManagement Act (Public Law 92-583); Delaware Beach Preservation\nAct; Florida Environmental and Water Management Act: New Jersey\nWetlands Act; Pennsylvania Constitutional Amendment; Florida\nState Comprehensive Planning Act\n1973 Colorado Land Planning and Policy Act; Delaware Wetlands Act;\nWashington State Planning Act\n1974 Maryland State Land Use pct,\nIn addition, there have been executive orders and local ordinances which\nhave restricted land use and established higher standards for air and water\nquality.\nThe version of the National Land Use Policy and Planning Assistance legislation introduced by Senator Henry Jackson* was passed by the Senate. However,\nthe version of this bill brought before the House of Representatives by Congressman\nMorris Udall was not reported out of Committee. This bill would have encouraged\nall states to become involved in land use planning. The Jackson legislation\nproposed that the federal government (through the Department of the Interior)\nwould appropriate to the states $982 million over an eight-year period to assist\nin the planning process. A similar bill is likely to be introduced in the next\nsession of Congress. However, as may be seen from the chronology of legislation,\n\n*U.S. Senate, Bill No. 5.268, 1973.\n8\n\n\t\n\nmany states have moves\' forward on their own. Currently, most federal funds\nfor state planning come from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS\nThe technology of remote sensing as it applies to land use planning has\ndeveloped considerably during the last six years. Three achievements are most\nsignificant: the perfection of high altitude aircraft photography and the\ndevelopment of satellite sensors, the successful demonstration of all-digital\nimage rectification techniques, and the development of machine spectral pattern\nrecognition processing.\nSince 1968, data from aircraft--borne sensors have begun to be used to\nidentify current land resource patterns and to describe changes. While the use\nof high altitude photography has penetrated to regional and county governments\nin some areas, the use of high-altitude aircraft data for complete and detailed\nland resource surveys at the state-wide level seems impractical for all but a\nfew states because of the enormous amount of data which must be collected and\nanalyzed. One of the principal uses of satellite-derived data may be to solve\nthis problem by deciding which areas in a state really need detailed coverage\nby aircraft. ERTS data in both image and computer-compatible-tape form are\nbeing analyzed to determine land resource information for states and large remote\nareas. The potential for improving recognition of land resources from the ERTS\nrepetitive coverage to obtain multi-temporal scene data is being investigated but\nwork has o.=_ly just begun. Finally, ERTS data for several states (e.g., Florida,\nWyoming, California, Michigan, and the Eastern Seaboard from New York to the\nDistrict of Columbia) have been assembled into mosaics to portray regional views\nof terrain. These mosaics have been used to educate prospective users on the\nadvantages of ERTS coverage and the potential that exists for large-area land use\nmapping using ERTS data, This potential is beginning to be exploited now by the\nU.S. Geological Survey, using data from ERTS and other satellites, in cooperative\nprograms with states.\nTechniques for machine processing to map land use categories are being\ndeveloped, but need further refinement, testing, and documentation before they\ncan become an operational tool. The advantage of machine processing -- and it\nis an important advantage -- lies in the fact that the data are processed in\ndigital form with increased radiometric fidelity and possibility of easy direct\nentry into computer data bases.\nA land use classification system developed by the U.S. Geological Survey*\nidentifies four classification levels, as follows:\nLevel 1\t\n\nSatellite imagery, with little supplemental information\n\nLevel II\t\n\nHigh-altitude aircraft and satellite imagery combined\nwith topographic maps\n\n*Anderson, .lames R., Hardy, Ernest E., and Roach, John T.: A Land-Use Classification System for Use With Remote Sensor Data. U.S. Geological Survey Circular 671,\nU.S. Department of the Interior, 1972.\n9\n\nLevel III\t\n\nMedium-altitude aircraft remote sensing (1:20,000) combined\nwith detailed topographic maps and substantial amounts of\nsupplemental information\n\nLevel IV\t\n\nLow-altitude aircraft imagery with most of the information\nderived from supplemental sources.\n\nA more complete description of these classification levels is given in the\nAppendix.\n\ni\n\nPROJECTED DEVELOPMENTS IN LAND USE PLANNING\n\nThe Panel expects activities in land use planning to be considerably\nincreased in the next 10 to 15 years, as a result of requirements specified by\npresent and expected legislation at the federal and state levels and by increased\nactivities of citizen groups and other elements of the private sector.\nANTICIPATED LAND USE LEGISLATION\nThe Panel expects two kinds of land use legislation to be proposed and\npassed in the next 15 years. First, Congress will eventually, if not in its\nnext session, pass national land use planning legislation, and may very well follow this with additional measures which further define national values for land\nresources. This legislation may well have an effect of the same magnitude as\nthe National Environmental Protections Act. Second, the states are expected to\ncontinue to pass planning and critical environmental area legislation that is\nappropriate to their particular land use problems and to their natural environment. It is very possible that this state legislation will have a more significant effect on land use in some parts of the country than national legislation.\nThis will be true particularly in states with fragile ecosystems and attractive\nland resources. California, Colorado, Vermont, Delaware, and other states for\nexample, have already passed acts which have more stringent requirements than\nare likely to be considered in federal legislation.\nThe Panel expects that local ordinances and international agreements will\nhave considerably less influence on land use planning than state and national\nlegislation. However, the current international crises of food and energy shortages could shift priorities in this nation and influence new state and national\nlegislation.\nASSOCIATED REQUIREMENTS\nLegislative programs, both existing and proposed, will establish requirements similar to the environmental impact statements for major federal projects\nand legislative proposals required by the National Environmental Protection\nAct. This Act has required that literally thousands of statements be filed,\nthat meetings be held, that hearings be conducted, and that reports be written\nand published. The benefits have been many -- in the form of better and\n11\n\nenvironmentally sound projects; better coordination between federal-federal,\nfederal-state, and local projects; and toward a general improvement in the quality\nof life.\nThe Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 is another example of a federal law\nwhich imposes requirements in land use planning. This Act allows for federal\ngrants on a two-thirds cost-sharing basis for the states to develop coastal zone\nmanagement programs. Annual grants are allowed in each of three succeeding years\nfor dev.:loping the management program. After the management program has been\napproved by the Secretary of Commerce and adopted by the state, the Act allows for\nfederal funding of two-thirds of the total cost of implementation. The Act\nrequires public hearings and coordination with federal, state, regional and local\ngovernments. The Act also requires the establishment of state regulations for\nuse and management for both land and water resources, and provides for state\npower to enforce these rules and regulations. The effects of requirements\nestablished under this Act are manifold in the land use planning in each of the\nthirty coastal-zone states. Many coastal wetlands of the type found along the\nEast Coast and in other parts of the country are large enough and ox such a nature\nthat useful information about these areas can be provided by remote sensing\ntechniques, particularly multispectral analysis. The uniform flatness of marsh\ntopography eliminates variations in reflectance due to sloping surfaces and\nshadows. The most common marsh plant species are few in number so that photointerpretation is simplified. Environmental changes, whether natural or man-made,\ngenerally take place over large horizontal distances in the marsh. Zones of\nrelatively uniform vegetation or land use are therefore usually large enough to\nbe discernible in current low-resolution satellite imagery. The major plant\nspecies, in particular, are different enough in their morphologies to have distinct\nreflectance characteristics. This facilitates the use of multispectral imagery\nto make detailed wetlands maps showing ve! , .tation growth patterns which are related\nto local environmental factors. As a result, automated digital techniques have\nbeen successfully used to prepare from ERTS-1 dig4.tal tapes, precision map overlays showing at least 12 categories of coastal land use and vegetation with interpretation accuracies of over 90 percent for all categories mapped.\nLand Use Commissions have been established by laws and executive orders in\nColorado, Alaska, Hawaii, Vermont and other states. One of the first charges of\neach Commission has been to provide a basic inventory and analysis of all resources\nand uses from existing data. Such analyses could and probably should be made with\nthe most sophisticated remotely sensed data available today.\nThe proposed National Land Use Policy and Planning Assistance Act (S.268)\nmentioned earlier would have provid e d encouragement as well as financial and\ntechnical assistance to states for land use planning, regulation and coordination\nof the use of federal and non-federal lands. According to the Act the states\nwould establish within three years, a land use planning process, a planning\nagency, an advisory council, an inventory and analysis of resources, and a program to regulate land development projects. Within five years, the states would\nadopt a land use program which included methods for exercising control over\ncritical environmental areas, key facilities, large-scale developments and new\ncommunities; establish a procedure for review of local regulations to protect\nthe larger interests of the state and the public; and provide a method for consistently relating state and local programs with state land use programs.\n\n12\n\ni\nt\n\nTHE PRIVATE SECTOR\nThe Panel believes that the gap between the potential use of remote sensing\ndata and its application is of an order of magnitude greater in the private\nsector than in the public sector. As the scale of planning for new urban developments increases and as the citizen-consumer becomes increasingly aware of the\nimportance of planning to optimize the use of land, the private sector will\nbecome more and more desirous of using remotely sensed data. Regional user\ncenters, if they existed, could encourage and facilitate broad application of\nsuch information by the private sector. The Panel believes that in the future,\nawareness of the capabilities of remote sensing and use of remotely-sensed data\nby the private land development sector will more closely follow the trend in the\npublic sector. This is expected because of the increasing interaction between\nprivate and public planners.\nLand use planning is also becoming an accepted area of corporate responsibility. Some corporations -- Xerox and IBM for example -- have for some time planned for the settlement of their employees in such a way as to minimize environmental disturbances associated with new plant sites. More recently, heavy\nindustrial developers have become aware of the need for land use planning.\nCITIZEN GROUPS\nThe Panel expects citizen groups at the national level -- such as the\nConservation Foundation, the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society, the National\nWildlife Federation, the Wilderness Society, and the Environmental Defense Fund\n-- to maintain and possibly increase their lobbying and educational efforts.\nEven more significant changes will occur at the local level as groups which are\neither affiliates of national organizations or organized on an ad hoc basis\nbecome increasingly involved in the planning process. We anticipate that some\nof these groups will recognize planning problems, acquire information, and formulate alternative goals and policies independently of existing planning agencies.\n\n13\n\n\t\n\ni\n\nANTICIPATED INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS\n\nAs remotely sensed data becomes increasingly used in land use planning, data\ncenters will need to be provided for distributing information. In determining a\ndata center size, and in making decisions about the advantages of regional centers\nas opposed to one central facility, the demands of the user for the various types\nof products from the system must be assessed. The parameters of interest include\nthe volume and type of data products required; the number of times per year the\ninformation must be updated.; the format of the data product; the timeliness of\ndelivery; the grid size of the information ( as contrasted with the sensor resolution element size); and some statement of the complexity of information required\nand the uniformity of information classes over large areas. A final parameter is\nthe accuracy of information. Ideally, these paT \xc2\xad Ei.ters would be listed for the\nresearch and development, transitional and open . tional phases of the program.\nThe volume of data required can be most easily specified by the user in\nterms of grid size of the area covered. Since data in various formats are\nrequired, and users may want different stages of processing, format definition\nmay be broken into three parts: the type of data (e.g., color IR composite\nimages); the kind of processing done to the data; and the Jelivery medium (e.g.,\nfilm transparency, computer - compatible tape). For film products, the scale\nshould be specified. Timeliness of delivery is the acceptable time between the\noccurrence of the event and the delivery of the product to the user. It includes\nthe time spent acquiring, processing, and disseminating data. The grid size of\ninformation is a specification of how the user wants his information quantized.\nIt affects sensor resolutions only in that they must be less than or equal to\nthe grid size. The classes of information required and the uniformity of those\nclasses over large areas are specifications relating to the extractive processing\nportion of the system. They determine the design of pattern - recognition devices,\nas does the required information accuracy.\nAt the present state of development of land use planning, requirements\ncannot be precisely identified for all users. In addition, this level of detail\nis beyond the scope of a two-week study. Thus, the Panel has chosen to describe\nuser requirements qualitatively, to establish a scenario for the more precise\nidentification of their requirements, and to present user case studies from\nthree states to convey some understanding of user requ^ irements.\n\nis\n\ni\n\n4rTz^fi=r.\t\n..\n\n- c\xe2\x80\xa2,_ .\t:^:,..^\t\n\nPA\n\nGE\t\n\n.,:.\t\n\nNOT\n^\n,<,.^,.\t\n\n....,:.\n\nUSER REQUIREMENTS\nDepending on whether the user is concerned with regional, local, or state\nlevel, the type and complexities, quantity, and grid size of information which\nhe requires from the remote sensing and processing system will vary. Users\nwill also require products at different stages of processing. For purposes of\ndiscussion, users are subdivided here into five groups: local, regional, state,\nfederal, and international.\nIn general terms, as one proceeds from local to international users, the\nquantity of data needed increases, the areal coverage increases, the grid size\nincreases, the number of classes (in pattern recognition outputs) tends to\ndecrease, and the classes tend to be more homogeneous over large areas. Timeliness may be unaffected, since it is tied closely to the information update\ncycle which in turn is tied to the change rate of the land use phenomena. Some\nregional users of remote sensing data (EPA, for example) may require very short\ndelivery schedules of processed data for enforcement of pollution laws. The\ngeneral situation is summarized in Table 1.\nIn Table I, a summary of user requirements, it may be seen that the required\narea coverage by individual users decreases as one moves from the national to\nthe local scale. At the state level, the total area requirement is for land areas\nplus the offshore coastal zone or outer continental shelf. The total areas\nassociated with regional sites probably add up to about 10 percent of the total\nU.S. land area. Central business districts, where 1-meter resolution is required,\ntotal about I percent of the U.S, land area. The total quantity of 1-meter\nresolution data (in terms of picture elements*) needed for a given area is\n100 times greater than the quantity of 10-meter resolution data. There is also\n100 times more 10-meter resolution data (?.n picture elements) than 100-meter\nresolution data.\nMost users require geometric correction to map bases. The accuracy of\nthe correction required is still a matter for debate by users and is more fully\na.iscussed in a later section of this report. The accuracy of the correction to\nmap base for the 100-meter data should be within a fraction of a picture element.\nA preliminary definition, subject to future revision by users, is that corrections\nshould be made with an accuracy of a fraction of the next largest grid size.\nThus, 10-meter grid-size data should be registered within, say; 30 meters of true\nmap grid, and the 1-meter data should be registered within, say, 3 meters of the\ntrue map grid.\nA PLAN FOR IDENTIFYING USER REQUIREMENTS\nIn an earlier section of this report (p. 3), six classes of participants\nin planning were identified as having information requirements which may be\nsatisfied by a remote sensing system. The order of these participants in terms\nof estimated benefits relative to costs is as follows:\n\n*A picture element (pixel) is the smallest discernible element of information in\na remotely-sensed image of the surface of the earth.\n16\n\nr\ns\n\nType of Data\n\nAre.\n\nUser\n\nLand use\n\n010\t\n\nType of\nP-10.8\n\nExtract tee;\nGcoOtte. c.erectian\n\nHap\nScale\n\n0elioery\nHediva\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2-\n\nTape,\n\nFrequency\n\nTlmel in.sn\nfin Months)\n\nInformaticn\nGrld Site\n(In Het.rs)\n\nCO. year\n\nSi.\n\n100\n\nORe 1110[111111..\n\nOne\n\nIn0\n\nclass.. of\nInforeati.n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAnderson\t t. 11\n\nClass\nUniforetity\n\nSame classes\nnatlon.ide\n\nAccuracy\nPercentage\n\nen-SS\n\nEn rap base\nU5 and offshore\nran\' karma] shelf\n\nnational Land Use\nAgency\n\nTem-par.n.Le,\n\nExtractive;\nGeometric correction\nto map base\n\ntinges\n\nCeextrle correction\n\nTransparencies\n\nL.trac tire;\nGeamCitlC [l [reCtian\n\n1\'1,000,000\n\nTapra\n\nLand capability\n\nState a mss to\n-tire LIS\n\nGeometric correction\n\nLand use change\n\nState and lath L-state\naegton.l Honttor.\nof frltkcaE\nEnvtromental Areas\n\n1-ges\n\nTape.\n\n--\n\n--\n\n-.\n\norUiT ,en es\n\n--\n\nI :50.060\n\n--\t\n\nThree to 11\nninths\n\nThree\n\n1n0^\n\nAndcrion\t 1,\t\n\nIt s\n\nSome differ at\nIC"" E, I1\n1-:1\xe2\x80\x94en physical\nraltons\n--\n\n95-90\n\nThere to 11111\nmrsf hs\n\nThree\n\n100\n\n-\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n--\n\nOne to three\n\nOne to two\t\n\n100\n\nLand capabkllty\t\n\nt\'arlatlonhet.enl\t\nrhystral regions\n\n95-90\n\n0nr to there\nYear,\n\nT.e1l\t\n\nLOn\n\nI.W ca l sty\t\n.Pb,\n\n5.[e ,peciftc\t\n\n50-90\n\nto nip base\n\nF^\nState and Hulti-state\t\n\xc2\xa2eglamal Entrepreneurs\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\nState areas to\n\nentire US\t\n\n- _\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\nImage,\n\n-- land capabl Iltl\n\nCeCae[Tie correction\n\nTransparent its\n\nIat\xe2\x80\x94TI-e;\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94Io.00O to\t\nI T O p 0, 000\t\n\ntaps\n\n--\t\n\nOn.\n\nyear\n\none ro t.o\t\n\n110\n\nGeometric correction\n\nto nip met\n\nTen percent of\t\nAeltn nai and Urban \t\nPrlrate fn[repren... \t\n\nJ\t\n\ncut,1 115 In\nSO..\nreg:anal cites\n\nTransparen,% ,\n\nimages\n\n1-.4.000\n\nOne year\t\n\nLand use\n\nCentral Rusin...\t\n0k.t rlc[, 1lrban Area,\t\nand Transport at on\t\nP lannrrs\t\n\nfart\t 11ve.\nGeo\t ne[rlc [\t rr e[t\xe2\x80\x94\nto \xe2\x80\x94r hase\n\n.taps\n\nI\t\n\nra.OnO\n\nAs iegll. r.d;\t\nOn\t -ear\n\nlm10ges\n\nGeasatric correctlon\n\nbastes\n\ni\t\n\nlO.POO\n\nAxrequired,\t\n\nOne percent of\nn\nt9[al\t\n500 k.\t\na\t\nre\xc2\xa2konal 111[111\n\n^- me scar\t\n\n--\n\nthree\n\nI\t\n\nLanJ uSite specific\nAnd eraon Itt.

For example, researchers and elected officials working with users should\nfirst define what types of information are required and in what formats. Whether\nthe required information can be obtained at all and the level of accuracy at\nwhich it can be obtained should be typical of early program concerns.\nIn the transitional phase, more users become involved, and considerations\nof required accuracy, timeliness of delivery, updated cycle, and grid size become important. Costs of providing services are also of concern in this phase.\nMore groups need to be involved here, working toward the ultimate goal of use\nof system information by all groups.\nIn fact, all groups will probably use the transitional phase remote sensing\nsystem to some degree, depending on their needs and the cost to them of using it.\nTo the extent that the degree of use by a given user can be predicted early in\nthe transitional phase, his operational requirements should be considered in\nthe operational system design.\nAt present, system needs in the R&D phase seem well identified by the\nresearcher (usually a geographer) working to some extent with the ultimate users.\nTransitional programs have only just begun, but the Panel believes that nearly\nall ultimate user needs should be considered before designing a transitional\nsystem (what may be referred to as an "applications system verification test").\nIn land use planning, the Panel feels that user needs can be established to the\ndegree required by the following procedures:\nStratify the country into uniform physiographic regions.\nWithin each region, survey by personal visit, questionnaire,\nor other contact, samples of all potential users, soliciting\nthe information listed in the earlier section entitled "User\nRequirements," for both transitional and operational systems.\n(The surveys proposed in a later section entitled "Required\nStudy" may be incorporated with this information.)\n\n18\ni\n\nConcurrently with an assessment of these user needs, NASA should\nassess the short- and Long-range abilities of the various users to\nassimilate and use the remotely-sensed information and the factors\nwhich might inhibit their use of the information.\nDesign the transitional system to serve as many of the potential\nusers as possible and take steps to encourage their participation\nand evaluation within each physiographic region.\nThe inclusion of state, regional., and local government, as well as private\nsector users at the transitional stage is important, and their needs should be\nconsiderel.\nRequirements for an operational system must be addressed before the transitional system is designed so that it can be structured to answer all the =user\'s\nquestions about the utility and cost of information -- questions that are of\nobvious concern. But quality control, the provision of auxillary products, user\neducation, and provision to the user of limited ability to check the information\nhimself are additional factors that will affect the design and cost of an operational system. The degree to which the user can participate in technical tasks\nsuch as data preprocessing and pattern-recognition processing should be assessed.\nThe Panel believes that involving ultimate users early in the conduct of\nresearch leading to operational applications of remote sensing systems will\nenhance user acceptance of the information once it becomes available. Considerable education of potential users will be required and should be provided for at\nthe transitional stage of the program.\nCALIFORNIA CASE STUDY\nThe land use program in the State of California is discussed here as a case\nstudy because there exists extensive documentation of activities (present or proposed) at the state level of government. In addition, California is representative of a heavily populated area, and provides opportunity for observation of a\nvariety of land uses. The Panel believes that the California experience represents one of the best available examples of extensive utilization of land-use\nclassification and of an accompanying expressed user demand for remotely sensed\ninformation.\nCitizen interest, strong legislation such as the California Coastal Zone\nConservation Act of 1972, and the Governor\'s "Environmental Goals and Policy\nReport\' s of dune 1973 all helped to stimulate a strong mapping and documentation effort throughout the state. Mapping programs at scales of 1:24,000 and\n1:62,500 have been undertaken to identify areas of critical concern. Thirteen\nstate agencies are involved in projects which either use or propose to use remote\nsensing. The basic information requirements of these 13 state agencies are\nsummarized in Table II.\nIn order to implement the requirements of these 13 agencies in the land use\nplanning process there has been proposed a California Land Use Classification\nProgram which includes 23 major classifications with 162 subcategories, as\nshown on Table 111.\n\n19\n\nREMOTE SENSING APPLICATION\n\nAGENCY\t\n\nDepartment of Food and Agriculture\n\nDifferentiate between major classes of land i+se, major crop\ntypes, and individual crops;

California also may well be a laboratory\nfor evaluating trade-offs and cost effectiveness of various techniques for acquiring data. Emphasis that the real objective is decision-making based on good\ninformation, and not simply data gathering, is evident from the following excerpt\nfrom the 1973 Annual Report of t\'he California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission*:\n"EMPHASIS ON DECISIONS, NOT DATA. The emphasis of the Commission\'s\nplanning is on reaching decisions, not on accumulating data. Volumes\nof information about the coastal zone already exist because of the\nwork of the many local governments along the coast, the preparation\nof the Comprehensive Ocean Area Plan (by the Department of Navigation\nand Ocean Development in the State Resources Agency), and the work of\nmany other State and Federal agencies.\n"Data is the necessary foundation for planning, but data is not of itself a plan. What is needed now is to use all available information,\nalong with other necessary research, to arrive at policies for the\nfuture of the coastal zone. For example, should "superports" for supertankers be built in the coastal zone? Should large coastal areas be\nused for housing, or should recreational development have a higher\npriority? Can better public access to the ocean be provided in builtup urban areas?"\nCOLORADO CASE STUDY\nThe Summary Report of the Colorado Land-Use Commission (December, 1973)**\nexhibits a substantially different user requirement than the California case study.\nThe Colorado report does not go deeply into land use classifications and specific\nuser needs but rather provides a perspective of a state land use management program which depends on a data base and information system for its successful operation. As of January 1974, maps and resource inventories were available in\nthe following areas:\nExisting land use\nLand ownership\nSelected energy resources and pipelines\nElectrical power plants and distribution systems\n\n*1973 AnnuaZ Report, California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission, San\nFrancisco, California, 1974, pp. 5--6.\n**Available from the Colorado Land-Use Commission, 1550 Lincoln Street, Denver,\nColorado 80203.\n25\n\nSelected Mineral lode resources\nPotential available groundwater\nSnow depth\nWater service areas\nPotential for irrigated agriculture\nPotential for non-irrigated agriculture\nSediment yield\nSoil shrink/swell potential.\nThe maps and inventories were prepared by utilizing standard cartographic techniques based on existing data sets, low-altitude aerial photography furnished by\nothers, as well as by specific field investigations. Significant contributions\nwere made to the mapping process by many federal, state, and local agencies, and\ninnovative formatting techniques were utilized to a large extent. The use of\nremote sensing was considered but was discarded because of the practical problems\nof matching ERTS imagery with existing base maps.\nFor furtherance of land use legislation enacted by the General Assembly of\nColorado, for the past three years the Colorado Land Use Commission has been\nbuilding a program designed to provide a framework and a process by which the\nstate and its political subdivisions can guide future development. As in\nCalifornia, emphasis in Colorado is on decisions based on data rather than on\ndata alone. As the Commission sees it, its recommended land use program:\nEmphasizes the local and regional levels of government as the\nprimary decision-makers on local questions of land use;\nFocuses on enhancing the quality of life, not just on restraining the quantity of growth; and\nProvides a flexible framework and process for guiding growth,\nnot just a traditional mapping and inventory plan.\nGiven the diversity of regional needs, the Commission had to formulate a\nset of goals for the state, reflecting regional diversity yet providing a focus\nfor a statewide land-use policy. The Commission first formulated broad goals,\nand then outlined targets (what ought to be done, where, and by when) and policies\n(who ought to do what, and how). Next came the consideration and adoption of\nprogram elements (the tools for carrying out the policies), and finally the\ndevelopment of an organizational structure and a set of short- and long-term\nstrategies. The Commission adopted goals for four major areas related to land\nuse -- environment, economic development and population, natural resources, and\nrelated social concerns.\n\n26\n\nThose goals, seemingly relevant to information needs to which remote sensing\nmight contribute, are listed below:\nControl development to conserve natural environmental amenities,\nincluding air and water.\nControl development in hazardous or environmentally fragile areas.\nInitiate measures to inhibit land uses which result in the unnecessary conversion of prime agricultural land.\nEstablish a state forest policy.\nEncourage effective and rational use of the state r s water\nresources.\nProvide for explicit analysis of social implications and impacts\nof public or major private land use decisions, as in provision\nof and access to health, educational, recreational, housing, and\nemployment opportunity.\nIn addition, the following policy themes which guide the development of programs appear relevant to the characteristics required of the information collection and distribution system:\nRegionalism constitutes the base for land use program planning\nand control. Within five regions, complementary land use planning\nactivities are carried out by planning and management districts\nand county and local governments.\nMonitoring and control of new development projects is a basic\nprogram element of the land use program.\nThe continuing comprehensive planning process (rather than a\nstatic master plan) is the key to an effective and workable\nland use program.\nBroad citizen awareness, involvement, and support are sought at\nall levels of the system.\nLand use program\nregional levels.\n\ncapability is\n\ndeveloped at the local and\n\nIn examining this case study the following facts became apparent to the\nPanel:\nColorado\'s mapping program and resource inventory did not\nmake use of data obtained by remote sensing from space even\nthough the program was accomplished during the period when\ndata were being provided by ERTS-1. This decision was reached\n\n27\n\nbecause of practical problems in matching ERTS imagery with\nexisting state base maps. This subject will be dealt with later\nwhen the matter of map projection is taken up.\nColorado\'s land use management progran re-emphasizes the need\nfor continued monitoring, identification, evaluation, and other\ndata programs which are not now being provided in any substantial\nway by space-based remote sensing systems. Improvements are\nneeded in ERTS map matching capability.\nThe emphasis on land use program capability at the lowest level\nof government in the state underscores the need for a distribution system which assures rapid dissemination of information.\nThe Colorado example underscores the need for a reliable information system\nand monitoring capability in the implementation of "growth centers" which are\nplanned to maintain and increase the social and economic viability of rural areas,\nthe slowing down of urban growth where it is appropriate, and the protection of\nprime agricultural lands and other natural resources.\nALASKA CASE STUDY\nAlaska offers an excellent opportunity for the application of remote sensing\ntechnologyr. There are many important needs for information on natural resources\nand on land use -- actual and potential -- but conventional means of data acquisition are difficult and costly because of difficulty of access to the greater part\nof the state and the lack of communication facilities. At the same time there\nare important onshore and offshore resources in Alaska of great value to the\nstate and the nation.\nGrowing requirements for fish, wood, oil, gas, minerals, recreation, clean\nair and water, while at the same time maintaining the quality of the environment,\nare putting great demands on planners in Alaska. Land use planners and resource\nmanagers need the best data possible. Remote sensing, from aircraft and from\nspacecraft, using most of the capabilities of available sensors would be very\nuseful now and in the future. ERTS data and imagery have proven very useful in\nAlaska. ERTS imagery is available now for all of the state except parts of\nthe cloud-shrouded Aleutian Islands. The Joint Federal-State Land Use Planning\nCommission and the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\nhave published a statewide set of ERTS mosiacs at 1:1,000,000 scale. The\nUniversity of Alaska has mosiacs for key areas at 1:500,000 scale. The University\nhas done an outstanding job in the research and development phase, but there is\nnow a need for both operational and extension service. Remote sensing data from\nhigh altitude aircraft are needed now.\nIt is the Panel\'s opinion that a joint federal-state remote sensing center\nfor Alaska should be established now to assist the native village and regional\ncorporations (established under a federal law), the state, the federal government, and private users in all phases of land use planning and land management.\nThe reasons are as follows:\nAlaska is one-fifth the size of the conterminous United States,\nand has about one-third of the nation\'s outer continental shelf.\n28\n\nThe state\'s resources -- particularly its energy and minerals\nare important to the state and nation.\nUnder the provision of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of\n1971, important and extensive claims of land ownership must be\ndecided within five years. The Joint Federal-State Land Use\nPlanning Commission assembled and is publishing with the state an\ninventory of the resources of Alaska. The Commission has also\nconducted cooperative training programs on the application of ERTS\ndata and has assisted in publishing an ERTS mosaic of the state.\nThe Commission could serve as a valuable interface between the\nproposed remote sensing center and the user community. The center\nshould provide not only research and development but operational\nand extension or educational services.\nA review of the state resources and recent developments may be helpful in\nunderstanding the needs of Alaska. Alaska is a complex combination of mountains,\nmuskeg, forest, tundra, glaciers and ice fields, rivers and lakes, islands and\nfiords, beaches and rocky coast, seasonally bounded by ice-free or ice-choked\nwaters. It is bordered by an outer continental shelf one and a half times the\nland area (375 million acres of land and inland waters). Major oil and gas\ndeposits exist both onshore and offshore. Alaska may have from three to eight\ntimes the known oil reserves found to date in the contiguous forty-eight states.\nThe mineral resources of the state are also very important.\nAlaska is relatively undeveloped. At present, only one-fourth of the state\nfalls in local political subdivisions. This situation, however, will change\nrapidly. The state will soon be divided into major areas of native, state, and\nfederal ownership. The Alaska Statehood Act of 1958 gave the state the right\nto select by 1984 about 104 million acres from the federal public domain. As of\nJuly 1972 only 14.5 million acres of this selection had been approved, The\nNative Claims Settlement Act allows native corporations to select approximately\n44 million acres of public land; their selection must be completed by December\n1975. In addition, the Act authorized the U.S. Secretary of the Interior to\nwithdraw up to 80 million acres of "National Interest Lands" for possible additions to the National Park, Forest, Wildlife Refuge, and Wild and Scenic Rivers\nSystems. He was also authorized to withdraw lands for "public interest." In\nDecember 1973 the Secretary submitted to Congress (in the proposed Alaska\nConservation Act) his recommendations for the 80 million acres to be added to\nthe four national conservation systems. In addition, he has withdrawn about\n60 million acres of "public interest" lands that will be controlled by the\nBureau of Land Management.\nThe federal and state governments are in conflict over the withdrawal of\nthe land and as to what ownership and management systems are best. The interests\nof the native corporations are also in conflict with state and federal interests\nin some areas. In addition, various industry and special interest groups, both\nin the state and the nation, have strong concerns about the final disposition\n\nof Alaskan lands.\nIn this case the Congress, the President, the Secretaries of the Interior\nand Agriculture, the Governor, and the Commission are the potential "prime users"\nof remotely sensed data. They need the best inventory and analysis of Alaskan\n29\n\nresources that current technology can provide to assist them in decision-making\nrelative to land use planning in the state. The remote sensing center for Alaska\nrecommended by the Panel is needed now. It is the Panel\'s opinion that the needed\ntechnical expertise resides in NASA and that NASA should be authorized by Congress\nto engage in operational aspects of remote sensing and in the extension or educational field. The other federal agencies involved in remote sensing could supply\nkey personnel and other services to assist. The State of Alaska should be a full\npartner to provide specification of user needs and to assist, at the state,\nregional, municipal, local, and private levels, in interpretation of the data.\n\nISSUES FOR THE USER COMMUNITY\n\nIn the course of its consideration of user requirements and ways in which\nthey may be better determined, the Panel has identified four issues common to\nall planning users which must be addressed and resolved by the user community\nbefore decisions may be made on sensor design and information extraction procedures. These four issues involve the establishment of standards for (1) the\nmatching of the space imagery grid with the existing planning grid; (2) the\naccuracy of information extracted from data obtained from spacecraft compared\nwith the accuracy of currently used data; (3) the categories which are required\nfor the information extraction process; and (4) the map projections in which\nspace imagery and present planning data are presented. For each of these, it\nwill be necessary for the planning community to assess present standards and\npractices and to discuss desired standards.\nGRID MATCHING\nThe grids used by various segments of the planning community differ. For\nexample, the property boundaries of the cadastxal grid are used at the local\nlevel while political boundaries of counties are used at the state level.\nProcessing of data from satellite observations is most suited to regular grids --a matrix if either square or rectangular cells. The user decision needed on\ngrids, ti.erefore, is concerned with how they will be matched and within what\nsp atial tolerances. If the planning community requires a close match, then the\nresolution requirements of the sensor system must be refined, the space imagery\nmust be accurately registered with ground control, and, perhaps most important,\nthe data volume must be substantially increased. For example, let us assume\nthat the State of Colorado wishes to prepare and regularly update a land use map\nin which the planning grid is ownership boundaries, and the required resolution\nis 10 meters. This resolution would require a total of 2.4 billion cells in the\nspace imagery, a volume of data which would severely strain the computer\nresources of most states. More importantly, this degree of precision may not\nbe necessary, since it may exceed the standards of conventional surveys.\nA suggested degree of precision is difficult to identify at this time, but\na preliminary definition of a grid cell size for statewide inventory is contained\nin Table I (e.g., 100 m). As a further example, California land use planners\nwant 4000 m (one acre) resolution to assess changes in critical environmental\nareas, but could accept 4-16 hectare (10-40 acre) resolution for general land use\napplications.\n31\n\nACCURACY\nAccuracy is a measure of the success of a manual or computer classification\nof remotely sensed imagery, expressed as a percentage of the certainty that the\ncategory identified on the image actually occurs at the corresponding point or\narea on the ground. Desired accuracy is a critical design parameter for both\nthe sensor and the classification system.\nIn its attempt to assign desired accuracy levels to various data categories\nand planning problems, the Panel has become aware that the planning community is\nnot certain of the accuracy of the data. it is now using. The Panel believes\nthat many of these data may have relatively low accuracies (lower than 75 percent).\nDATA CATEGORIES\nThe set of land use categories proposed by Anderson et al (see Appendix)\nis considered adequate for land use description at the national level. For\nplanning at state, regional and local levels, however, it may be desirable to\nhave a somewhat different set of categories which are specific to the type of\nproblem or the characteristics of that particular area. A land-quality classification, for example, will be much more elaborate than the Anderson system.\nLocal jurisdictions may wish to include a category for land which is under\ndevelopment. It appears that specific category requirements such as these could\nbe accommodated within the Anderson classification at Level IV. However, planning agencies at present use widely different systems and it must be expected\nthat it will be difficult to arrive at standard categories which will be accepted\nby a majority of regional and local planners, especially in critical environmental areas.\nMAP PROJECTIONS\nData sensed from space must be presented in a kno;n coordinate system or\nmap projection. The UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) is generally considered\nto be the most suitable projection for large scale maps except at high latitudes.\nIt is used for most national topographic map systems.\nThe UTM projection and the closely related State Plane Coordinate System\nare among the several map projections which are used by planning agencies.\nOthers are the polyconic, the Lambert conformal, and local map projections.\nThese variations in user demands mean either that space imagery must be provided\nin the projection requested by the users, or the user must convert his existing\nspatial data to the projection of the space imagery. The Panel sees considerable difficulties with either alternative.\nREQUIRED STUDY\nThe Panel 2ecommends that an integrated comprehensive study to resolve\nthese issues be initiated and completed as soon as possible. The results of\nsuch a study will be useful for the design of future sensor systems, and in\n32\n\nI\ni\n1\n\nl\n1\n\naddition will assist in leading to better recognition of the usefulness of space\nimagery in the existing planning process. The study should contain the following elements:\nA survey of planning grids and the spatial tolerance required\nto match them with space data to the same precision as exists\nin conventional map matching,\nThe determination of accuracy standards in data presently used\nin planning,\nA survey of variations in data categories and map projections,\nand\nAn estimate of the costs and benefits of standardized classification systems and map projections.\nThe Panel makes no recommendation as to what agency should be responsible\nfor this study except that it should include planning users. Parts of this\nstudy may be incorporated with the user survey recommended earlier. (Refer to\nsection entitled "A Plan for Identifying User Requirements.")\n\n33\n\nRECOMMENDED REMOTE SENSING PROGRAM\n\nThe Panel recommends a remote sensing program for the next 10 years which\nfocuses on three key areas of land use planning:\nMonitoring of change in non-urban and critical environmental\nareas,\nDetailed survey of critical environmental areas and their surrounding land use, and\nLand capability mapping.\nUsers require information in these areas to satisfy requirements of laws and\nexecutive orders, to identify problem areas, and to prepare revisions of comprehensive plans.\nThe Panel believes that if adequate research and development is completed\nin these three areas, operational programs could begin as early as 1980 and no\nlater than 1985. Several new institutional arrangements will be required however, if this program is to succeed.\nTo provide a context in which to consider more thoroughly the scenarios for\nimplementation of each of these applications, the Panel hypothesized a remote\nsensing system identical to the one conceived by the Information Services and\nInformation Processing Panel*. For such a system, Figure 11 shows the steps\nbetween the collection of data by any of several remote sensors, and the ultimate use of information derived from the data to make decisions beneficial to\nsociety.\nThe process begins with the collection of data by any of several remote\nsensing systems. Then the data are preprocessed to remove effects peculiar to\nthe instrumentation, to calibrate the data radiometri.cally, and to perform geometric corrections so *hat the data conform to a selected map base. The next\nstep is information extraction in which parameters of interest are developed\nfrom the data (e.g., the acreage of a crop is estimated, or the temperature of\na body of water is determined). Frequently the output of the information\nextraction step is not exactly what the user requires and must be converted\nbefore he can use it to help him make a decision. For example, if the user\nPanel on Information Services and Information Processing. Practical Applica-\n\ntions of Space Systems; Supporting Paper 13: Information Services and Information Processing.

Further filtering will\nyield a map showing changes from open space to urban. The model which performs\nthis and similar jobs is termed a "user model." Here, the term model means an\nordered set of procedures by which decisions are made or remote sensing parameters are inverted to information useful to the user. In this case, the model\nis not necessarily a computerized mathematical algorithm, although many user\nmodels could be. The information from the remote sensing system is combined with\nother information in the user\'s management model, from which he makes decisions\nint-.ended to be beneficial to society. The existence of a management model is\nalmost invariably a result of reaction to legislation or pressure from society\nto identify and take action on a certain problem.\nIn the sections that follow, scenarios are developed for each of the three\nkey areas mentioned in the beginning of this section. A time line (i.e., a\nschedule of events) for research and development, transitional, and eventual\noperational systems is presented, and critical factors are identified.\n\nCHANGE-DETECTION (LAND USE AND CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AREAS)\nThe area of change detectiou consists of the identification of changes in\nthe use of land areas of states and -regional areas monitored by particular\nfederal. agencies (e.g., national parks or national forests), and detection of\nchange in the condition of critical environmental areas identified by states or\nfederal agencies (such as the Environmental Protection Agency). There are current statutes which require state and federal agencies to monitor such changes.\nSome private groups and local governmental units also monitor changes in areas\nunder their jurisdiction or of interest to them, and more may be expected to do\nso in the future.\nIt is the judgment of the Panel that the land use planning community will\nhave a strong need for a system to detect land use changes by 1979. Such a\nsystem will be practical only if it includes the economies and speed of satellites\nsuch as the Earth Observatory Satellite (EOS). NASA should now emphasize programs\nin user education, data geometric rectification, and information handling to permit meeting user needs in 1979.\nA schedule for the development of the necessary spacecraft by the late 1970\'s\nis presented in Figure III. Beginning in the 1974 time frame, the Panel finds\nsome experimental evidence that the Anderson Level I and most of Level II (urban\nareas excluded) can be fairly accurately (70 to 90 percent) mapped from ERTS-1\ndata with spectral pattern recognition techniques.\n\nRFD Phase\nIn the ERTS-2 period, the Panel recommends that emphasis be placed on establishing routines for the information extraction techniques and improving the\naccuracy of recognition through the use of temporal and spatial features in the\nrecognition process.

Relatively more emphasis and funding should be provided for collection and analysis of aircraft data.\nThe geometric rectification techniques being developed by NASA\'s Goddard\nSpace Flight Center should be made avaiFable in late 1975. These techniques\nshould be thoroughly exercised, and a capability for similar rectification of\nlow- and high--altitude aircraft MSS data should be developed by late 1976.\nAt the same time that data techniques are being developed, surveys of\nfederal, state, local, and private user requirements should be made as recommended in the earlier section on User Requirements. Federal agency requirements\nfor information will particularly need to be assessed. In 1977, or after a\nfederal land use planning bill eventually passes, the transitional phase program\nshould be designed by a consortium of federal, state, and private users or their\nrepresentatives, with NASA participation.\nIn the 1975 to 1977 time frame, the development of an information data base\nshould be pursued. Such a data base should be capable of storing ancillary and\nremote sensing derived information in a grid format for areas the size of a\nstate or region. This capability will be required by state and federal agencies\nin the eventual operational program, and should be exercised and modified in\nthe transitional phase. Eventual users should definitely be on the design team\nto assure that their requirements are served.\nBeginning in 1975, user education will be required to inform, especially,\nthe state and local users of the capabilities and aspects of remote sensing\ntechnology. 1he education process can be accomplished by a combination of the\nU.S. Department of the Interior (USDI) Earth Resources Observation System (EROS)\nData Center instruction, intensive seminars in various states conducted by NASA\nor other federal agencies, and education by universities and research groups in\nremote sensing. If users are to be convinced of the potential of remote sensing\ntechnology, the results of a complete change detection exercise, including the\ninformation data base results, should be presented before the implementation\nof the transitional phase.\nIn this advanced R&D stage, coincident with the life time of ERTS-2, NASA\nshould supply preprocessed data to investigators working closely with state and\nfederal agencies. The Panel considers it appropriate that NASA, with perhaps\nsome state and federal support, fund the processing and analysis of data. The\ndata should be evaluated by the users and NASA.\n\nTransitional Phase\nIn the transitional phase (1977 to 1979), the updated extractive processing\ncapability, the information data base development, and user requirements should\nbe integrated for a semi.-operational test of the change detection and monitoring\ntechnique. The Panel recommends that several large test sites, perhaps one in\neach physiographic region of the U.S., be used. The concept of a regional data\nprocessing center should be exercised at this time, since this is the probable\ndata dissemination method of the ultimate Operational system. With cooperation\nbetween centers, the adequacy of the data analysis procedures devised in the\n39\n\nR&D phase can be tested. Data for the transitional phase experiments will be\nsupplied by the ERTS-C or EOS-A satellite system and by low- and high-altitude\naircraft as required to permit assessment or Level II land use patterns within\nurban areas.\nToward the end of the transitional phase, a first capability operational\nsystem could be defined. Further education of potential state and federal users,\nusing the results of the transitional phase (which should include cost estimates\nof processing), should result in the identification of many more potential users.\nOperational Phase\nToward the end of the transitional phase in 1979, the clear perception of\nthe roles of satellite and aircraft sensors and the required data processing\ncapabilities will permit a definition of an initial operational system. The\noperational system components cannot be specified in great detail at this time,\nbut the collection system will probably consist of aircraft, polar and (later)\ngeosynchronous spacecraft, and the users\' ground and auxillary data collection\nprocedures. Processing will probably take place partly in central facilities\nand partly in regional facilities. Users will require a variety of intermediate\nproducts as well as the final remote sensing information. The operational system\nshould include the means to permit the user to check the accuracy of the final\ninformation product delivered and to assure its reliability. The institutional\narrangements for the operational phase are not clear now, but it seems clear\nthat the bulk of the cost will be borne by the users.\nThe Panel believes that a change-detection system could be operational by\n1979, using data from the EOS-A satellite and low- and high-altitude aircraft\nsensors. As later sensor systems capabilities such as the Synchronous Earth\nObservatory Satellite (SEOS) become available, the proper role for these systems\nwithin the change-detection system should be defined. We expect that the impact\nof SEOS on change-detection capability will be positive and beneficial because\nof its ability to view areas under cloud--clear conditions at different times of\nthe day and frequently, if necessary. For example, the monitoring of coastalzone areas on schedules related to the tidal cycle would be well served by a SEOS\nsystem. The Panel feels that the capabilities of SEOS should be integrated into\nthe change--detection program structure already defined for the polar orbiting\nspacecraft sensors and aircraft sensors, and this progress will justify additional\nresearch and modification on the information data base.\nPERIODIC INVENTORY OF CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AREAS\nThis application consists of the detailed inventory of critical environmental areas (CEA) on a periodic basis or as required if the change-detection\nsystem indicates a change in such an area. Typical state and anticipated federal\nlegislation requires frequent monitoring of critical areas as well as surveys of\nchanges by state and federal agencies. If periodic inventory of such areas is\nto be accomplished by techniques other than aerial photography -- an expensive\ntechnique -- considerable development of remote sensing technology will be\nrequired. Periodic inventory of CEA will undoubtedly require r mix of aircraft\nand spacecraft sensor data different from the change-detection application\n40\n\nbecause higher resolution is needed and area requirements are more restricted.\nBecause of the varying character of different critical environmental areas,\ngreater flexibility in the information extraction phase will be required for\n::hange detection. While an unsophisticated user model was required for change\ndetection, a set of much more sophisticated user models may be required for\nobtaining the CEA information.\nSince the criteria for defining critical environmental areas are generally\nnot stated in legislation, the definitions used by state and federal agencies\nvary considerably. However, these agencies have mutually agreed upon certain\ncritical environmental areas, as follows:\nPower plant environments,\nGoal and oil-shale surface-mining areas,\nCoastal zones,\nNational and state parks,\nKey wildlife habitat areas,\nHazardous areas (geologic, fire, flood),\nOil pipelines, refineries, and ports, and\nAgriculture.\nThe state-of-the-art in remote sensing assessment of the areas listed above\nvaries. Power plant sites have been monitored with low-altitude aircraft, primarily to assess heated water effluents. Coal strip-mining areas have been\nmonitored successfully from ERTS, but greater spatial resolution (10 to 30 m)\nseems to be required for a detailed inventory of activities. Coastal-zone wetland areas have been surveyed with low-altitude aircraft, and wetlands and\ncoastal water quality have been monitored from ERTS. Detailed species recognition is necessary for assessing coastal wetland quality, and this requires\nresolution on the order of 10 meters. Yellowstone National Park was surveyed\nby ERTS-1, and preliminary vegetation and other resource maps prepared. More\ndetailed assessments, especially to assess wildlife habitat and recognize important conifer communities (e.g., white bark pine) require both higher spatial\nresolution and sp:ctral bands different from those on the ERTS system. Wildlife\nhabitat areas have been surveyed from low altitude aircraft and to some extent\nfrom spacecraft. In many cases, the size of many of the critical wildlife\nhabitats is small (100 to 200 km 2) and a resolution of about 10 meters is required.\nThese areas have been effectively surveyed in California with high-altitude infrared photography. The survey of hazardous areas (geologic, fire and flood) and\nof oil pipelines has only recently started, and considerable work is required.\nAgricultural lands have been surveyed by low-altitude aircraft for many years and\nnow by ERTS.\n\n41\n\nSchedule for Research and Development of Periodic Inventory Capability\nThe schedule for developing capabilities for periodically monitoring certain\nenvironmental areas (e.g., power-plant impact, coal and oil-shale mining, coastal\nzones, national and state parks, agricultural lands and wildlife habitat areas)\nis more amenable to quantification than for monitoring other areas, such as\ngeologic hazards and oil pipelines, because more research and development\nwork has been done. All of these activities are viewed as in the RFD stage\nnow. Additional work is needed to identify the spectral bands required and to\ndefine the necessary information extraction techniques. Because the trend in\nfuture satellites (e.g., EOS) is toward spectral bands optimizes} for those applications which are closest to the operational stage, RFD work on these areas\nshould proceed using data from aircraft MSS, where data from a number of spectral\nbands may be obtained. Indeed, the relatively small extent of many of the critical areas and the generally high resolution requirements may justify use of multispectral scanners in high altitude aircraft as a part of the operational system.\nThe schedule for development of each of these capabilities calls for continued RFD with low-- and high-altitude aircraft, ERTS, and EOS-A, with emphasis\nin the 1980 time period on the definition of operational system requirements.\nRFD work on potential EOS-A systems is justified because of the need for the high\nresolution pointable imagery (HRPI) devices potentially capable of providing the\n10-meter resolution that these applications require, and the need to determine\nspectral bands, spatial resolution, and radiometric precision optimized for land\nuse planning applications to guide EOS--A thematic mapper* development.\n\nR&D Program\nAn R&D program is suggested to accomplish the considerable work yet to be\ndone in critical environmental areas. The general state-of-the-art of assessment\nof critical environmental areas is such that four important requirements must be\ndetermined: (1) some estimate of the update cycle needed to monitor impact of\nnew facilities (e.g., power plants, pipelines) on the environment, (2) the provision for 10-meter resolution and a determination of the fraction of the work\nthat could be done at coarser resolution, (3) the spectral bands required for\neach assessment function, and (4) details of the information extraction procedure.\nBecause of the expected modest size of critical areas, and the requirement\nfor about 10-meter resolution, there seems to be a need for both low- and highaltitude aircraft MSS. High-altitude aircraft MSS, if available by late 1976,\ncould provide 10-meter resolution at swath widths nearly comparable to IMP!,\nwith more spectral channel flexibility (if a modular scanner were used) in a time\nframe two years before HRPI might become available on EOS-A.\nGeometric rectification techniques should be developed, at least for the\nhigh altitude aircraft data, to permit the registration of these data with those\nof other sensors in the information data base discussed in the section on Change\n\n*A moderate--resolution multispectral scanner being planned for possible use on\nthe EOS-A satellite.\n42\n\nDetection. This development should also be undertaken because there is a reason-able expectation that aircraft monitoring of some of the environmentally critical\nsites might prove to be the most cost-effective operational solution.\n\nInstitutional Arrangements\nThe Panel suggests that for these R&D activities, NASA, other federal\nagencies, and state governments, where appropriate, share the costs of research,\nwith NASA and such federal agencies as the Environmental Protection Agency and\nthe Department of the Interior bearing the brunt of the costs. As operational\nrequirements are defined, the federal and state agencies should be canvassed in\naccordance with procedures described in the section on Anticipated Information\nRequirements.\n\nTransitional and Operational Phases\nBecause of current uncertainties in the length of the RFD program caused\nby limitations of available aircraft sensors, geometric rectification, and program funding, beginning points for the transitional and operational phases are\ndifficult to identify. However, if optimum benefits are to be derived from\nan inventory of coal and oil-shale surface mining, at least a Quasi-operational\ncapability must be available before extensive development of the western oilshale deposits begins. Similarly, an oil pipeline and refinery monitoring\ncapability should be available before Alaskan pipeline construction is far\nadvanced. Since many states have coastal-zone legislation now, the need for\nperiodic survey of coastal areas exists. An anticipated national wetlands survey,\nto be conducted by the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior\nin the next five years, further encourages the research in this area.\n\nLAND CAPABILITY INVENTORY\nThe Panel expects that major improvements in land use planning would occur\nif better estimates of land capability, suitability, or capacity were available.\nInitial examples of land capability information are found in the Soil Conservation\nService soil-capability index, which provides lane use planners with some indication of the suitability of given sites for agriculture, and measures of the suitability of sites for residential development based on such criteria as the\nengineering prope,:ies of soils and potential for on-site sewage disposal. At\npresent, such classifications have been developed and applied to most agricultural and federal forest, range, and park lands. These schemes are relatively\nsimple, however, and allow little detailed planning. Classification systems for\nurban uses have been developed and applied to areas around several cities, but\ncoverage is incomplete, ;rd classifications vary considerably. The Panel believes\nthat an R&D program shc,til-J be instituted to define the extent to which remotesensing systems can contribute to the process of inventorying land capability and\nto define the sensor system, information extraction system, and user model\nrequirements of such systems.\n\n43\n\nThe definition of land capability fox a given use is a multidisciplinary\nproblem. It involves such disciplines as geology, geomorphology, hydrology,\npedology, plant and animal ecology, climatology, agronomy, forestry, range management, civil engineering, architecture, and landscape architecture. Specialists\nin these disciplines, together with land use planners and technologists, will\ncomprise a team whose goal is the development of information extraction techniques and user models to derive land-capability information from the remote\nsensing data.\n\nCRITICAL FACTORS\nThe previous discussions have mentioned several critical factors that\ninfluence the use of remote sensing data for land use planning. In this section,\nrecommended actions concerning these critical factors are given:\nDevelopment of operational geometric rectification capability\nby NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center by late 1975,\nDevelopment of high-altitude aircraft multispectral scanning\ncapability and data rectification techniques to assist in\nresearch on critical environmental area and land capability\ninventory and perhaps as part of an eventual operational system,\nDevelopment of an information data base to store information\npertinent to the land use planning process derived by moth\nremote and nonremote sensing,\nInvolvement of ultimate users in the transitional phase of program development, accompanied by the development of regional\nanalysis centers to assist in the information extraction task,\nand\nResolution of the issues of grid matching, accuracy, data\ncategories, and map projections.\n\n44\n\n-a\n\nSPACE SYSTEMS\n\nIn the R&D, transitional, and operational phases of the land use changedetection program, the Panel sees a need for satellite systems of at least two\nsorts -- high--inclination systems (possibly sur, synchronous) and geosynchronous.\nThe Panel feels that ultimately an operational satellite to monitor changes in\nland use will be needed. In the interim, however, data from RFD satellites can\nbe used for system development and prototype operations.\nFor system development, data from the ERTS, EOS-A and SEOS satellites can\nbe used. These data may be supplemented by data from aircraft sensors as\nrequired for assessment of urban areas. For research in the periodic inventory\nof critical environmental areas, considerably higher resolution, smaller-area\ncoverage and greater flexibility of spectral bands will require either highaltitude aircraft MSS capability, or some modular MSS in a shuttle sortie or\nspacelab mission. Microwave sensors and modular MSS may be required in the\nspacelab and in high-altitude aircraft for research or land use capability\ninventory.\nERTS TIME FRAME\nERTS-2 or ERTS-C data can be used to assist in the design of a quasioperational test of the change detection system. For monitoring critical environmental areas, studies to date indicate that the spatial resolution and spectral\nband location are marginal for many cases. The possibility of using temporal\nvariations in terrain signatures as an aid to automatic recognition of terrain\nobjects remains to be thoroughly assessed.\nEOS TIME FRAME\nData from the thematic mapper and from the high resolution pointable imager\nplanned for EOS-A could be used in a quasi-operational (transitional phase)\ndemonstration of the change--detection system. At the same time, data from the\nthematic mapper (with about seven spectral bands) and HRPI (potentially with\n10-meter resolution) could be used to advantage in research on periodic assessment of critical environmental areas and research in land capability inventory.\nLow- and high-altitude aircraft multispectral scanner data may still be required\nfor both research and operational uses.\n45\n\nSHUTTLE TIME FRAME\nIt is clear to the Panel that space systems will play a major role in the\nultimate operational land use mapping and change-detection system. Although the\nexact roles cannot be defined at present, satellites with both high inclination\nand geosynchronous orbits are required. Some method of getting these satellites\nto orbit is required. Shuttle systems could emplace both operational high inclination and geosynchronous land use change-detection satellites as soon as the early\n1980\'s. However, potential problems exist in not having a shuttle high inclination launch capability before 1982 because of the development schedule of the\nWestern Test Range. The Panel feels that some high inclination launch capability\nshould be provided in the early 1980\'s. Gaps in this capability, or the necessity of using more expensive expendable boosters, may delay the deployment of an\noperational change-detection satellite system.\nEven when an operational change-detection system exists, continued upgrading\nof the system will be needed. For example, detailed inventory of critical\nenvironmental areas and land capability analysis will be added as these capabilities are developed. Advanced experiments in these areas could be profitably\nperformed using specialized or prototype operational sensors in a spacelab. The\nuse of microwave sensors (both passive and active) to provide ail-weather terrain\nmapping capability and potentially to assist in the delineation of land capability\ncould be assessed on a spacelab mission.\nIf an operationaZ change-detection program is to be relied upon in the early\n1980\'s continuity of service must be assured. The availability of a shuttle\ncapability to launch replacement satellites, with the potential to calibrate and\nrepair existing ones and to fill in critical data gaps, should not be minimized.\n\n46\n\nV\n\nFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nFINDINGS\n\nBecause of increased intensity of Land use planning, and the potential for\ngreater awareness on the part of land use planners of the potential usefulness\nof remote sensing, the Panel concludes that remote sensing systems will be useful\nin future land use planning efforts which are likely to be required because of\nexpected legislation.\nThe Panel further concludes that information from an aircraft-spacecraft\nremote sensing change-detection system, auLmented in later stages by capabilities\nto periodically inventory critical environmental areas and to survey land capability will be essential to land use planning by 1985.\nThe Panel concludes that remote sensing can act as a pacer and prod in the\nplanning process because of the repetitive nature of the information provided and\nits rapid. availability.\nThe Panel finds that although many land use planners are aware of the possible usefulness of remote sensing, few have been able to exploit its potential.\nThe Panel concludes that present methods for assessing the requirements of\nusers for remote sensing data and information are inadequate to properly design\nand implement transitional and operational phases of the Panel\'s proposed change\ndetection, periodic inventory, and land capability systems.\nThe Panel estimates that, if conventional means of data gathering are used,\nabout $250 million per year will be spent in the next decade collecting information for nonfederal agencies. The Panel believes its proposed remote sensing\nsystems could supp ly more up-to.-date information at significantly lower costs.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n1. The Par2eZ recommends that three systems be developed to provide information essential for land use planning, as foZlows:\na.\n\nA change-detec*ion system for monitoring land use and\ncritical environmental areas, to be operationaZ by 1979,\n\nb.\n\nA system for periodic detailed inventory of critical\nenvironmental areas, to be operational by 1983, and\n47\n\nC. A system for detailed land capability inventories, to\nbe operational by 1983.\n2.\n\nThe Panel recommends that NASA take the following specific actions:\n4\n\na.\n\nProvide a high-altitude aircraft rauttispectral scanner\n(MSS) capability to accelerate the deveZopment of periodic\nmonitoring and Zand capability inventory systems,\n\nb.\n\nProvidegeometrically and radiometricatty corrected\ndigital tapes of ERTS-2 and ERTS-C data by the end of\n1975 to permit development of the change detection system\nby 1979, and\n\nC. Vigorously pursue a program of documentation of computer\ninformation extraction software and specification of\nspecial purpose computer hardware.\n3. The Panel recommends that a program be established to make available\nto the public, on a regular basis, info:-ration on the current use of land in the\nstate, region or ZocaZ area and that this be done using an effective media such\nas color television.\n4. The Panel recommends that studies be made to resolve issues in the user\ncommunity concerning grid matching, accuracy, data categories and map projections.\n5. It is reeommenr\'ed that the capability be developed to provide users with\ninformation products processed to varying degrees, and with means to verify the\naccuracy of the products.\n\n6. It is recommended that joint federaZ-state remote sensing centers be\nestablished on a regional or state basis to provide area-oriented research,\ndevelopment, operational, and extension service to users, and, because pressing\nrequirements and unique opportunities exist in Alaska, that a prototype remote\nsensing center be established there immediately. Consideration should also be\ngiven to another prototype in a state where needs and institutions are more firmly\ndeveZoped, such as in California.\n7. The Panel recommends that NASA be authorized by Congress to provide\noperational and extension (education) services in the data extraction and utilization area to both public and private remote sensing users.\n8. It is recommended that arrangements be made without delay for users to\nparticipate in the planning process, and that their participation take the form\nof providing information requirements rather than sensor design parameters.\nThe Panel recommends that a complete survey of all potential users be\n9\t\nconducted to determine area coverage, grid size, update cycle, and required\ninformation, and that the survey be repeated at appropriate intervals to assess\nchanges in user requirements.\n48\n\ni\n\n10. Ae PaneZ recommends that teams of users\' representatives and technoZogists periodically review user requirements and convert them into system pararneter\ndefinitions.\n11. Ae PaneZ reconmends that any reconsideration of national land use\nlegislation include specific provisions for the use of -remote sensing in the data\nacquisition process.\n\n49\n\nI\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nA LAND-USE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\nFOR USE WITH REMOTE-SENSOR DATA*\nFor many years, agencies at federal, state and local government levels have\ncollected land use data, working for the most part independently and without\ncoordination. Too often this has meant duplication of effort or acquisition of\ndata for a specific purpose which were of little or no value for a similar purpose a short time later. Attempts to reE\'olve these problems in the collection\nand handling of different types of data have led to some reasonably effective,\nthough not perfect, solutions, as evidenced by current programs in soil surveys,\ntopographic mapping, collection of weather information and the inventory of\nforest resources.\nRemote sensing techniques, including conventional aerial photography, can\nnow be used effectively tD complement surveys based on ground observation and\nenumeration so that a timely and accurate inventory of the current use of the\nnation\'s land resources is possible. At the same time, data processing\ntechniques permit the storage of large quantities of detailed information that\ncan be organized in a variety of ways to meet specific needs. Development and\nacceptance of a syst^m for classifying land use information, obtained primarily\nby use of remote sensing techniques but reasonably compatible with existing\nclassification systems, is urgently needed.\n\nDesigning a Land Use Classification System for Use with Remote Sensing Techniques\nThere is no ideal classification of land use and it is unlikely that one\nwill ever be developed. Different perspectives in the classification process\nand the process itself tend to be subjective. Land use patterns change, as do\n\n*Abstracted from "A Land-Use Classification System for Use with Remote-Sensor\nData,"<..:.es K. Anderson, Ernest E. Hardy, and John T. Roach for the Inter-e\'gency\nSteering Commitee on Land Use Information and Classification, U.S. Geological\nSurvey, Circular 671, Washington, D.C., 1972.\n\nEC]MMG PAGE\n\nBLS XOT\n\nIxft\nA\n\ndemands for the natural resources which affect development of land use patterns.\nEach land use classification is made to suit the needs of the users and few users\nwill be satisfied with an inventory that does not meet most of their needs. In\nattempting to develop a classification system for use with remote sensing techniques that will satisfy the needs of the majority of users, certain guidelines or\ncriteria for evaluation must first be established.\n"Land use" is defined as "man\'s activities on land which are directly related to the land." Some land use activities can be directly related to the type\nof land cover; for instance, farming can be inferred from planted corn. Other\nactivities, especially recreational activities, can be related to land cover by\nuse of remote sensing techniques only with difficulty; for example, hunting can\nnot be directly inferred from land viewed as forest, range or agricultural. Land\ncover is therefore the basis for categorization at the first and second levels\nand the activity dimension of land use for the third and fourth levels of categorization.\nA land use classification system must allow for the classification of all\nparts of the area under study and should also provide a unit of reference for\neach land use. A system for use with orbital imagery should meet the following\ncriteria:\n1.\n\nThe minimal level of accuracy in the interpretation of the\nimagery should be about 90 percent.\n\n2.\n\nThe accuracy of interpretation for the several categories\nshould be about equal.\n\n3.\n\nRepeatable results should be obtainable from one interpreter\nto another and from one time of sensing to another.\n\n4.\n\nThe classification system should be usable or adaptable for\nuse over an extensive area.\n\n5.\n\nThe categorization should permit vegetation and other types\nof land cover to be used as surrogates for activity.\n\n6.\n\nThe classification system should be suitable for use with\nimagery taken at different times of t;ie year.\n\n7.\n\nEffective use of sub-categories that can be obtained from\nground surveys or from the use of larger scale or enhanced\nimagery should be possible.\n\n8.\n\nInter-relation of categories must be possible.\n\n9.\n\nComparison with land use information compiled in the past\nor to be collected in the future should be possible.\n\n10.\n\nMultiple -use aspects of land use should be recognized when\npossible.\n\n52\n\n--\n\nJ\n\nIn the use of this proposed classification system, an accuracy in interpretation may be attained that will make the information comparable in quality\nto that obtained in other ways. For many users of land use information, the\naccuracy of interpretation at the generalized first and second levels is satisfactory when the interpreter makes the correct interpretation 85 to 90 percent\nof the time. Greater accuracy will generally be attained only at much higher\ncosts which may not be justified for the purposes for which the information is\nobtained.\nThe accuracy ultimately attainable at each level of the classification\nsystem will in large part be determined by the capabilities of the sensors. At\npresent, the capabilities of aerial photographs at scales of 1:50,000 to 1:20,000\nor larger are well known. There has been limited experience with imagery at\nscales between 1:50,000 and 1:120,000 and essentially no experience with imagery\nat ratios of less than 1:200,000. Experience in learning how to extract information from the commonly used 1:20,000 imagery, however, indicates that whatever\nthe present ability may be, it will improve.\nThere have been a few major developments in automatic and semi-automatic\nequipment for interpretation, but for the most part, these are still experimental and there is very little expertise in their use. Thus classification of\nland use from imagery will remain a visual interpretation task for some time and\nwill only gradually become a semi-automatic or fully automatic procedure.\nThe kinds and amounts of land use information that may be obtained from\ndifferent sensors depend on the altitude or the resolution of each. There is\nlittle likelihood that any one sensor or system will produce good information at\nall altitudes. It would be desirable to evaluate each source of remote sensing\ninformation and its applications solely on the basis for the qualities and\ncharacteristics of the source. However, it is common practice to transfer the\ndata to a base map, and no matter what the guidelines, it is difficult to use a\nbase map without extracting some additional information. Topographic maps contain an abundance of information and even road maps or a detailed city map will\ncontribute detail beyond the capabilities of the remote sensor image employed.\nThe land use classification -ystem described herein has been developed on\nthe assumption that different sensors will provide information for different\nlevels of classification. In general, the following relations are anticipated\nbetween classification level and source of information:\nLevel I\t\n\nSatellite imagery, with very little\nsupplemental information\n\nLevel II\t\n\nHigh altitude and satellite imagery\ncombined with topographic maps\n\nLevel III Medium altitude remote sensing (1:20,000)\ncombined with detailed topographic maps\nand substantial amounts of supplemental\ninformation\nLevel IV\t\n\nLow altitude imagery with most of the\ninformation derived from supplemental\nsources\n\n53\n\nDescription of Classification Levels\nSatellite imagery from ERTS-1 and ERTS-2 will generally be prepared for\nusers at a ratio of 1:1,000,000. At this ratio, 1 centimeter represents 10\nkilometers (1 inch = -jl6 miles). Even if information is generated by transferring data to much larger scale maps, only a general classification based on\nmajor differences in land cover can be made. This would also be true for\nimagery at ratios up to 1:25,000 and Level I would be appropriate for these\nsources also.\nLevel II units of classification are based on retrieval from imagery at a\n1.6 mi). Information can be\nratio of about 1:100,000 (1 cm = 1 km; 1 in = \t\ntransferred within reasonable accuracy to fairly detailed maps, including the\nU.S. Geological Survey\'s 1:24,000 topographic maps, and a substantial amount of\nsupplemental input can be obtained. The greater detail will allow classification on the basis of more specific uses of land rather than only nine major\ntypes of cover of Level I and the complexity of the inventory can be increased.\nThe categories proposed at Level II cannot all be interpreted with equal\nreliability. In parts of the United States, some may be extremely difficult\nto interpret from high--altitude aircraft imagery alone. Rather than distort the\ncategorization and so reduce the number of useful applications, it seems preferable to suggest that additional steps be taken to cutain a satisfactory\ninterpretation. Conventional aerial photography and sources of information\nother than remote sensor data may be needed for interpretation of especially\ndifficult areas. On the basis of previous tests, it may be assumed that the\ncost of using such supplementary information can be held to reasonable levels.\nExamples of the classifications of land use made at Levels I and II follow:\nLevel I\n\n\t\n\n01.

Permanent snow and icefields\nAt Level III, substantial amounts of supplemental information would be used\nin addition to remotely sensed information at ratios of 1:40,000 to 1:15,000.\nAt a ratio of 1:24,000, 1 inch represents 2,000 feet and information can be\ntransferred directly to the 1:24,000 topographic maps. Surprisingly detailed\ninventories may be undertaken and most land uses, except those of very complex\nurban areas or throughly heterogeneous mixtures,can be adequately located,\nmeasured and coded.\nLevel IV of the projected classification would call for much more supplemental information and remotely sensed data at a much larger scale.\nLevels III and IV are closely related to regional requirements; therefore,\nno examples of thE.se classification requirements are given.\n\n55\n\n'
