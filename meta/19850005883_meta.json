It regulates plant growth because photosynthetic rates are strongly dependent on the concentration of nitrogen in leaves, and because relatively large mounts of protein are required for cell division and growth. Yet nitrogen is abundant in the biosphere - the well-mixed pool in the atmosphere is considered inexhaustible compared to biotic demand, and the amount of already fixed organic nitrogen in soils far exceeds annual plant uptake in terrestrial ecosystems. In regions where natural vegetation is not nitrogen limited, continuous cultivation induces nitrogen deficiency. Nitrogen loss from cultivated lands is more rapid than that of other elements, and nitrogen fertilization is generally required to maintain crop yield under any continuous system. The pervasiveness of nitrogen deficiency in many natural and most managed sites is discussed.", "title": "Terrestrial nitrogen cycles:  Some unanswered questions", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T13:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850005883, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vitousek, P."}, "organization": {"name": "Stanford Univ.", "location": "CA, United States"}}, "id": "d144f375bc9c44779c9a1d2f03649603"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19850005883, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850005883, "id": "3f588ed62c664de19078b2f68ade17cd", "publicationName": "JPL  The interaction of Global Biochemical Cycles", "publicationDate": "1984-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19850005874, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "The Interaction of Global Biochemical Cycles", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
