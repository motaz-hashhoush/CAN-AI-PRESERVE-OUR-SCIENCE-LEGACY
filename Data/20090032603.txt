Its discoveries are relevant to all three of the\nother branches of the Science Mission Directorate (SMD). The changing solar output interacts\nwith each of the planets in different ways. The Sun is the only star that can be examined in sufficient detail to use it as the Rosetta Stone for stellar astrophysics. Solar flares and coronal mass\nejections modulate the geospace environment affecting not only Earth-orbiting satellites including Global Positioning Systems (GPSs), but also perturbing ground-based technologies such as\nelectric power grids. Extreme events could affect the safety of astronauts operating beyond the\nprotective shield of the magnetosphere. Heliophysics works on spatial scales that span over 10\ndecades and temperatures that range from 200 K to over 20 MK.

is dominated by the Sun. Its constantly changing output of energy,\nparticles,\t and magnetic\t fields\t affects\t the entire\t solar system in a variety of\nfascinating ways. The branch of science devoted to understanding these phenomena\nand their relevance to other scientific disciplines is called " heliophysics." It covers\nvast ranges of temperature, densities, spatial scales, and energies. Particles and fields\nfrom the Sun impact the Earth causing the georiiagrietic storms and the buildup of\nparticles in the radiation belts. The effects of solar variability form an intricate chain\nof complex physical processes that stretch to the edge of Interstellar space, defining\nthe hello sphere\xe2\x80\x94the volume of space in which humans will exist and operate for the\nforeseeable future.\n\nSunspots are areas of concentrated strong magnetic field, often larger that the Earth.\nThey appear dark because they inhibit the flow of energy to the surface of the Sun\nand thus are cooler. They appear iii cycles peaking approximately every I years. At\nthe onset of a cycle, they appear at high latitudes, but emerge at successively lower\nlatitudes until most of the remaining activity is concentrated near the equator at solar\nminimum.\n\n!^\xc2\xb1\n\n*\n\n`\n\nA\n\n^\n\n`\n\nStrong fields oil\n\t Sun can become twisted and stretched, storing energy that can\nbe released in flares. These explosive events can increase short wavelength\nemissions from the Sun by many orders of magnitude in seconds, accelerate particles\nto near relativistic velocities, and heat the solar atmosphere to over 20 MK. The\neffects range from direct atmospheric heating, shortening the life of Low-Earth Orbit\n(LEO) satellites, to complete radio blackouts by saturating those bands, GPS for\nexample.\nAnother type of eruptive event involving the reconfiguration and reconnection of\nmagnetic fields is the Coronal Mass Ejection. They are vast expulsions of cororial\nplasma into interplanetary space where the fast moving (sometimes >2000 kill/s)\neJ\t ecta interact with the solar wind. Sometimes the\tY\t strike Earth\'s mag\trietosPhere\nand, if the magnetic configuration is favorable, can cause geomagnetic storms and\nother- space weather effects.\n\nSuperposition of Extenie Ultraviolet (EUV) imaging of the cold plasina iii the inner\nmagnetosphere (10,000 K), the hot plasma electrons (10,000,000 K) precipitating in\nthe aurora, the hot plasma ions of the ring current (up to 1,000,000,000 K). These\nlast make up the hottest region in the inner solar system, even hotter than the solar\ncorona (1,000,000 K).\n\n,`wr\nr\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nAuroras are one of the most obvious consequences of a geomagnetic storm in\nprogress. Particles accelerated by magnetic reconnection in the tail of Earth\'s\nmagnetosphere streaming along field lines impact the upper atmosphere creating\nthese dazzling and dynamic light shows in the polar regions.\n\nThe heliosphere represents the entire domain of the Sun stretching over 100 AU in\nthe rain direction and many tunes that towards its tail. This shape is rather like\nEarth\'s magnetosphere inn the solar wind. Here, the solar wind slows due to the\n\n\'\n\ninflow of interstellar gases fornning a shock region. \t Similarly, the interstellar\nmaterial is slowed as it encounters the solar wind building up a bow shock.\n\ni\n\n/^00^ll \'.-\t\n\ny\n-\n\n- -\t\n^ -\t\n\nRM\nMW\n\nA inodel of the complex interactions of the Earth\'s iagnetic field with the solar\nwind using a 3-D modeling code developed and tested at the GSFC Community\nCoordinated Modeling Center (CCMC)\t facility.

HSD comprises\napproximately 261 scientists, technologists, and\nadministrative personnel dedicated to the goal of\nadvancing our knowledge and understanding of the\nSun and the wide variety of domains that its\nvariability influences.\n\no GSFC has a key role in every\nmajor \'_NASA heliophysics\nmission currently flying or\nbeing planned.\no HSD made some amazing\nscientific contributions to\nbetter understanding the Sun\nand its sphere of influence in\n2008.\no HSD has supported the\ndevelopment of the mission\nconcepts and technologies vital\nto the future of heliophysics.\n\nHSD\'s Mission is to explore the Sun\'s interior\nand atmosphere, discover the origins of its\ntemporal variability, understand its influence\nover the Earth and the other planets, and\ndetermine the nature of the interaction behveen the heliosphere and the local\ninterstellar medium.\nActivities:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lead science investigations involving flight hardware, theory, and data analysis\nand modeling that will answer the strategic questions posed in the Heliophysics\nRoadmap;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lead the development of new solar and space physics mission concepts and\nsupport their implementation as Project Scientists;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide access to measurements from the Heliophysics Great Observatory\nthrough our Science Information Systems;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Communicate science results to the public and inspire the next generation of\nscientists and explorers.\nOutcomes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Open the frontier to space environment prediction;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Understand the nature of our home in space;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Safeguard the journey of exploration.\nThe HSD scientists and staff have had a highly productive year. The "Extreme UltraViolet Normal Incidence Spectrograph (EUNIS)," Principal Investigator (PI) Doug Rabin\n(671), and "Twin Rockets to Investigate Cusp Electrodynamics (TRICE)," GSFC Lead\nCo-Investigator (Co-I) R. Pfaff (674), had fiilly successful flights on 2007 November 16\nand December 10. The United States Air Force Communications/Navigation Outage\nForecast System (C/NOFS) and NASA\'s Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission\nwere launched on 2008 April 17 and October 19, respectively. Rob Pfaff (674) is the PI\nfor the Vector Electric Fields Instrument (VEFI) science investigation on C/NOFS, which\nincludes five instruments, including contributions by several of HSD partner institutions.\n\nvii\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\nTom Moore (670.0) and his plasma instrumentation team provided key portions of the\nIBEX low-energy neutral-atom imager. With Mike Kaiser (674) as Project Scientist , the\ntwo STEREO spacecraft reached their operational separations in 2008 and are now\nobserving the start of the rising phase of Solar Cycle 24. Joe Davila (671) led the\ndevelopment of the inner coronagraph (CORD on STEREO and is Goddard\'s lead Co-I\non the Sun\xe2\x80\x94Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Imager (SECCHI) coronal\ntransient imaging investigation.\nThe past year also saw HSD scientists producing new scientific and technical results. Len\nBurlaga (673) and his colleagues on the GSFC magnetometer teamM. Acuna (695), J.\nConnerney (695) and R. Lepping (674)observed Voyager 2\'s crossing of the\ntermination shock caused by the collision of the solar wind with the local interstellar\nmedium at the outer edges of the solar system. In contrast to the earlier Voyager 1\nencounter with this important boundary, the Voyager 2 measurements revealed a new\ntype of collisionless shock with strong coupling to interstellar neutral particles. Jim\nSlavin (670.0), Guan Le (674), and Y. Wang (UMBC/GEST) published the first\ngradiometric measurement of auroral field-aligned currents in low-Earth orbit using the\nSpace Technology 5 (ST5) micro-satellites. This approach provides current density\nmeasurements that are not aliased by plasma waves and other temporal variations, and it\ndemonstrates the capabilities of micro-satellites to produce unique, research-grade\nobservations.\nHSD published 213 papers in refereed journals in 2008, of which 44% had a GSFC\nscientist as first author; 70 more papers are either in press or submitted. In addition, HSD\nscientists gave 162 presentations at 65 different conferences, most of which were given at\nthe two American Geophysical Union (AGU) meetings. Appendix 2 details the body of\nwork that the group has accomplished in the last year or so.\nHSD scientists garnered many top professional honors in 2008. The EUNIS rocket team\nwon the Robert H. Goddard Exceptional Achievement Award for Science. The National\nAcademy of Sciences awarded the 2008 Arctowski Medal to Leonard Burlaga. Spiro\nAntiochos was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society. Jim Slavin received the\nNASA Exceptional Achievement Medal for Space Technology 5, NASA\'s micro-satellite\nconstellation technology mission launched in 2006. Arland Bhatia was invited to give the\nProfessor S.C. Sircar Memorial Lecture at the Indian Institute for Cultivation of Science\nin Kolkta, India, which is one of India\'s highest scientific honors.

Only a\nfraction of these can be even briefly highlighted in this report.\nThe production of this report was guided by Holly Gilbert, HSD Associate Director for\nScience, who, together with Keith Strong (SP Systems), assembled the contributions and\nchecked the report for accuracy, made suggestions regarding its content, and contributed\nto several sections. Julia Saba (Lockheed Martin) and Yvonne Strong (American Society\nof Microbiology) helped with the scientific and technical editing, and Julie Rickman\n(GSFC) contributed by compiling the large bibliography of the HSD. The publication\nwas led by Elaine Firestone (TRAX International, from Goddard\'s Technical Information\nand Management Services Branch, [TIMS], Code 271) and graphics support was\nprovided by Robert Kilgore (TRAX International and TIMS). Many others in HSD\nhelped with useful and constrictive suggestions concerning the organization of this report\nand its content.\nHolly Gilbert and Keith Strong\nMarch 2009\n\nx\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\nHSD\'s goal is to further scientific understanding of the nature and origins of the everchanging physical conditions throughout the vast volume of space controlled by the\nSun, and in which humanity will function for the foreseeable future.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nHeliophysics is simply the study of the domain of the Sun\xe2\x80\x94the hello sphere\xe2\x80\x94fromits\nnuclear core where hydrogen is transmuted into helium, producing the energy that drives\nchanges throughout the entire solar system, to the edge of interplanetary space where the\nsolar wind and magnetic fields cede control of the local physical conditions to the\ninterstellar medium. That represents over 10 8 AU\' suffused with outflowing plasma,\nmagnetic fields, and solar radiation, with temperatures ranging from over 20 MK to near\nabsolute zero.\nThe heliosphere is an interconnected network of physical processes driven by the\nrelentless, but varying, outflow of energy from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic\nradiation from y-rays to radio emissions, ionized and neutral particles, and magnetic\nfields. All these forms of solar emissions interact in different ways in the wide range of\nenvironments from the hot solar interior, through the Sun\'s thin surface layers, into the\nextended solar corona, and throughout interplanetary space to the very edge of the solar\nsystem. Along their tortuous path, these emissions interact with different planetary\nenvironments, comets, asteroids, and interstellar gas\xe2\x80\x94each with its individual response\nto the changing solar stimuli. HSD\'s goal is to understand this system of systems.\nAccomplishing this goal involves the study of the complex interactions between\nelectromagnetic radiation, plasmas, and magnetic fields, with three principal objectives:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To understand the changing flow of energy and matter\' throughout the Sun, solar\natmosphere, heliosphere, and planetary environments\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To explore the fr.rndamentol physical processes that characterize space plasmas\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To define both the origins and the societal impacts of variability in the Sun Earth\nSystem\nThere are four major physical domains that encompass HSD\'s mission: the Sun, the inner\nheliosphere, geospace, and the outer heliosphere.\nThe Sun\n\nThe Sun generates not only energy, but also magnetic fields. The solar dynamo,\ncombined with both radial and latitudinal differential rotation, generates magnetic fields\nand stores vast amounts of energy in them. Convection in the outer layers of the Sun and\nthe natural buoyancy of the flux ropes drag these strong fields (>1000 G) to the surface,\nas evidenced by the presence of sunspots and faculae, which change the solar spectral\nirradiance that provides the energy to drive Earth\'s weather and climate system. Thus a\nsignificant change in solar irradiance could affect Earth\'s climate.\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\nEnergy is transported from the solar core region (the inner 20% of the solar radius) by\nphoton radiation out to about 70% of the solar radius, but then convectional transport\ntakes over, carrying most of the energy to the surface of the Sun\xe2\x80\x94the photosphere\nwhere the optical depth of the solar plasma drops, so that much of the energy can be\nradiated away into space. The falling temperature gradient as the energy flows outward\nseems well understood; however, just above the relatively cooler surface layers, the\ntemperature of the plasma rises rapidly again to form a 1-MK corona. The physical\nprocesses involved in creating and maintaining the corona are not completely understood\nas yet.\n\nAnatomy of the Sun.\n\nThe energy stored in the solar magnetic fields is often released suddenly by magnetic\nreconnection to produce flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Flares produce\nemissions from \'y-rays to radio wavelengths, accelerate solar energetic particles, and\ntransport material from the lower layers of the atmosphere up into the hot corona via\nchromospheric evaporation, accompanied by ejection of material away from the Sun.\nCMEs are vast ejection events that can grow to be many times the size of the Sun and at\ntimes move with velocities exceeding 2000 km/s.\nAnother type of mass outflow from the Sun is more continuous but also highly variable:\nthe solar wind, which flows out along the spiraling solar magnetic field with velocities of\n\n2\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\nbetween 300 and 700 km/s at various temperatures, densities, and compositions. The\nmanner of its acceleration is still not completely understood.\n\nThe Inner Heliosphere\nThis is the region between the Sun and Jupiter that is filled with outflowing, supersonic\nsolar wind and frozen-in spiraling magnetic fields\xe2\x80\x94the Parker Spiral. The streams of\nsolar plasma evolve significantly as they pass through this region, where fast streams of\nsolar wind plough into slower-moving ones forming shocks. Transients, such as CMEs,\nreshape the ambient environment. Some CMEs move faster than the local solar wind,\nbuilding up high-density fronts that form shocks where particles are accelerated to\nextremely high energies. CMEs can expand as they move outwards, leaving low-density\nregions behind the propagating front.\nElectrons flow along the\nlarge-scale magnetic field\nlines, producing radio\nbursts of various types and\nshoe- which field lines\nremain connected back to\nthe Sun and which ones\nhave reconnected.\n\nG\n\nBecause of the spiral\nnature of the fields, Earth\nis better connected to the\nwest limb of the Sun; thus,\nan event at, or near, the\nwest limb of the Sun is\n\nmore\t\nlikely\t\nto\t\nbe\ngeoeffective than one in\nthe eastern hemisphere of\nthe Sun. Photons take only 8 min to arrive at Earth from the Sun, and high-energy protons\ncan be detected a few minutes later, whereas material from a CME event seen on the Sun\nmay take up to 3 days to arrive.\nA CME propagates through the heliosphere towards Earth.\t\n\nGeospace\nEarth\'s magnetic field acts as a barrier to most of the harmful particle fluxes originating\nfrom the Sun. Much of the solar wind is directed around the magnetosphere, which forms\na teardrop-shaped shield around Earth. The shape and size of the magnetosphere change\nas solar wind conditions vary. Earth\'s magnetic field is compressed within about 10 Earth\nradii (RE) on the sunward side of the planet and stretched out by many tens of Earth radii\non the anti-sunward side. The faster and denser the winds, the more the fields are\ncompressed and stretched. The direction of the interplanetary field profoundly influences\nthe effects seen; a CME with an oppositely directed magnetic field will more likely\nreconnect, allowing more energetic particles to enter geospace, and producing a more\nenergetic geomagnetic stone.\n3\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nWhere the solar wind and Earth\'s\nmagnetic field collide there is a bow\nshock region. The fields become weak\nand disorganized as they interact in the\nmagnetosheath. The surface where\nEarth\'s magnetic pressure is balanced\nby the solar wind is called the\nmagnetopause; it often ripples and flaps\nin the solar wind, and parts constantly\nmagnetically reconnect and break away.\nIn the polar region, there is a path where\nthe solar particles have easy access to\nEarth\'s magnetosphere\xe2\x80\x94this is the cusp\nregion.\n\nSome of the complex physical processes that occur when incoming radiation and charged particles\ninteract with Earth\'s dynamic atmosphere.\n\nCloser to Earth, a completely different set of closely coupled processes occur. Here, solar\nradiation has one of its primary effects. Ultraviolet (UV) light from the Sun, especially\nwhen enhanced by flare emissions, heats the neutral atmosphere, increasing its scale\nheight, which reduces the orbital life of spacecraft. Gravity waves propagate up from\nbelow in the neutral atmosphere. The thermosphere becomes partly ionized by absorbed\nsolar emissions that heat it increasingly with altitude. As a result of changing inputs, it\nbecomes highly dynamic. The ionosphere, the first completely ionized layer of Earth\'s\n4\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\natmosphere, becomes very disturbed at times of high solar activity; these disturbances, in\nturn, interfere with many forms of HF radio communications, and cause bulk outflow of\nthe ionosphere into the magnetosphere from the auroral zones. High-energy electrons and\nprotons become trapped in the Van Allen radiation belts. The outer belt gathers electrons\nfrom the aftermath of geomagnetic storms and substorms, accumulating enough plasma\npressure to produce a ring-shaped current around Earth that substantially inflates the\ngeomagnetic field. The inner belt originates from cosmic rays interacting with the upper\natmosphere. Charged particles spiral along the field lines, mirroring as they descend into\nthe stronger polar fields.\n\nThe Outer Heliosphere\nThe characteristics of the\nheliosphere significantly change\npast the orbit of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x94this area\nis called the outer heliosphere.\nHere, the solar wind and transients\ninteract with the gas-giant planets,\nwhich are very different from their\nrocky cousins in the inner\nheliosphere.\nIn this region, the nature of the\noutflowing plasma also changes;\nthe interplanetary magnetic field\nbecomes mostly azimuthal, and\ntherefore, is perpendicular to the\nsolar wind flow and is where solar transients and interplanetary shocks catch up with\neach other and form large Global Merged Interaction Regions. In addition, a larger\nportion of the solar wind is composed of photoionized interstellar neutral particles,\nknown as pickup ions.\nWith increasing distance from the Sun, the particle and field pressure of the solar wind\ndecreases until it reaches pressure balance with the local interstellar medium. This\nboundary is called the heliopause; however, before reaching this boundary, the solar wind\nhas to slow abruptly below its supersonic speed at the termination shock, and start\ndeflecting toward the heliotail and continue slowing down in the region known as the\nheliosheath. The interaction of the heliosphere with the interstellar medium is analogous\nto the solar wind deflecting around Earth\'s magnetosphere. It is postulated that the\ninterstellar plasma could also flow at supersonic speeds, necessitating the existence of an\nexternal bow shock and a pileup of interstellar particles upstream of the heliosphere,\nknown as the hydrogen wall. Besides low-energy neutral particles, the extremely highenergy galactic cosmic rays also enter the heliosphere, but not without first being\nmodulated by the periodically varying heliospheric magnetic fields. The termination\nshock and heliosheath are thought to also be the source of an extra, anomalous\ncomponent of the cosmic rays observed at Earth.\n\n5\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nHSD is an internationally recognized research organization dedicated to the\nfurtherance of scientific understanding of all aspects of heliophysics.\n\nTHE HSD ORGANIZATION\nAt the end of FY08, HSD was composed of 261 scientists, engineers, and other staff\nsupported by a small management and administrative team. The Division employs 75\ncivil servants (29%), as well as university scientists working under cooperative\nagreements (13%), technical contractor staff (41%), NASA Postdoctoral Fellows (6%),\nemeritus scientists (6%), and other support staff (5%).\nThe organization is divided into four Laboratories, each with its own Chief, as shown in\nthe figure below. HSD is supported primarily by competitively awarded funding from the\nNASA Science Mission Directorate with the remainder made up of assigned NASA\ntasks, Center research and development investments, and funding provided by other\nFederal agencies.\n\nScience\n\n& Exploration\n\nCode600\nDirector - Nick White\n\n.,\t\nEarth Sciences\t\nCode 610\t\nDirector\t\n\nFranco Einaudi\t\n\nAstrophysics\nCode 660\nDirector\n\nBill Degerle\n\nSenior Scientists\nWar Physics\xe2\x80\x94Joe Davila\nHeliospheric Physics \xe2\x80\x94 D.

They are the Space Physics Data Facility, the Solar Data\nAnalysis Center, Heliophysics Data and Modeling Consortium, and the Community\nCoordinated Modeling Center. These centers are fiinded directly by NASA and\nreviewed periodically by NASA Headquarters-appointed external committees.\no Education and Public Outreach (E/PO): HSD scientists, led by the Associate Director\nfor Science (Holly Gilbert), carry out a variety of E/PO tasks supported by Project\nand competitively awarded funding.\nLike many Government, academic, and industrial research laboratories that perform basic\nand applied research in specialized areas, HSD has experienced recruitment challenges in\nreplacing retirees and recruiting new staff to achieve its research goals, in addition to its\nflight project, and data and modeling Center responsibilities. For this reason, HSD is\nactively recruiting within the university community to attract new post-doctoral,\ncooperative agreement, and civil service scientists. For example, in FY08, HSD\nwelcomed 15 postdoctoral fellows to the HSD organization. The Division also has other\nstudent development programs to attract more young researchers to space science and\nretain the most promising candidates. Another important goal is to achieve greater ethnic\nand gender diversity in the HSD workforce. Over the past year, HSD lost seven staff\nmembers to retirement and hired six new civil servants (Holly Gilbert, Spiro Antiochos,\nJim Klimchuk, Eric Christian, Judy Karpen, and George Khazanov).\n\n7\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\nHSD\'s goal is to provide a safe and efficient work environment, consistent with being\na center of excellence for heliophysical research.\n\nFACILITIES\nHSD has people located in\nseveral buildings on the GSFC\ncampus, primarily Buildings\n21 and 26. Following the\nopening of Building 34, plans\nare in place to consolidate the\nwhole Division into Building\n21 over the next two years.\nOnce this is completed, all\npersonnel,\t\noffices,\nHSD\t\nlaboratories, and other\nfacilities will be housed in the\nsame building for the first\ntime.\n\nBuilding 21 Entrance\n\nIn 2008, the renovation of Building 21 was started. The most significant project was the\nexpansion and rehabilitation of the Space Plasma Instrument Facility. The original\nlaboratory configuration included a 753-square feet (ft 2) clean room and 935 ft\' of\nlaboratory space, and housed an electron vacuum chamber and an ion vacuum chamber.\nOnce the expansion is completed in mid-2009, the Plasma Laboratory will have 1200 ft2\nof clean room, 1000 ft2 of laboratory space, and an additional electron chamber. Other\nrenovation work included updating a conference room and some initial office upgrades.\nA display area was added to the lobby to showcase HSD\'s heritage, along with current\nmissions and scientific results.\n\n8\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\nWith a strong scientific base, HSD can function effectively to support and promote a\nvital heliophysics program at NASA\n\n2008 SCIENTIFIC HIGHLIGHTS\nWhile it would not be practical to feature, in detail, all the\nscientific accomplishments of the HSD team in this type of\nreport, a few outstanding examples of work that was\nsuccessfully completed in 2008 are presented in this\nsection. A short summary of individual scientific\ncontributions is given in Appendix 1, and more extensive\nlist of publications and presentations can be found in\nAppendix 2.\n\nEUNIS Probes a Coronal Bright Point\nThe Extreme-Ultraviolet Normal-Incidence Spectrograph\n(EUNIS) is a Goddard-designed and operated soundingrocket instrument that obtains imaged high-resolution solar\n--4\nspectra. It has now had two successful flights, on 2006\nApril 12 and 2007 November 16, providing spectra of\nunprecedented temporal resolution (<10 s), as well Doug Rabin (PI) and the\nunderflight calibrations for a number of orbiting solar EUNIS field team at white\nexperiments on both occasions (including the Sands readying EUNIS for\nSOHO */Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer and the launch\nHinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer).\nEUNIS gathers spectra in the 170-205 A and 300-370 A wavelength regions and is\ncalibrated to an absolute photometric accuracy of <15%. During its 2006 flight, it\nobtained spectra of a coronal bright point (BP).\n21.5\n\nThe quiet solar corona is heated\npredominantly by small-scale magnetic\nreconnection events.

The EUNIS data provide that opportunity because of their extensive roster\nof temperature and density-sensitive line ratios and radiometric precision.\nThe subsequent analysis enabled the EUNIS team to:\no Derive the first differential emission measure (DEM) of a coronal bright point (see\nfigure),\no Show that BPs have photospheric, not coronal, abundances, and so are likely filled by\nchromospheric evaporation,\no Conclude that BPs are formed by magnetic-reconnection-driven chromospheric\nevaporation.\nEUNIS is funded for a third flight in 2010, which will explore a different wavelength\nregion with an advanced variable line space grating and more sensitive detectors.\n\n10\n\n\t\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nCoronal Tomography\nThe STEREO COR1 instruments provide\nwhite-light observations of the solar corona\nfrom 1.5-4 solar radii (Rs) where the\ntransition from closed to open coronal\nstructures takes place. COR1 polarized\nbrightness images from the two spacecraft\nare used to reconstruct the electron density\nstructure in this region. The reconstruction is\nperformed by the regularized tomography\ninversion method. This method allows\nreconstruction only of structures that are\nstationary during an observation period, i.e.,\nfrom a quarter to half a solar rotation for\nperiods when the Sun is relative quiet. The reconstructed density structure of the\nequatorial streamer belt in most of the reconstructed domain is consistent with the\nvariation of the current sheet derived from a potential magnetic field model. This code is\nbeing modified to provide these models routinely to help assess the value of tomographic\nreconstruction in understanding coronal and heliospherical processes.\n\n0\t\n\n90\t\n\n270\t\n\n180\t\n0\t\n\n200\t\n\n3600\t\n400\t\n\n90\t\n600\t\n\n180\t\n\n270\t\n\n360\n\n8001\xe2\x80\x94"]\n\nSpherical cross-sections of the reconstructed electron density for Carrington rotation 2066 at\nheliocentric distances 1.6, 2.0, and 2.4, Rs (the distances are shown in the right upper\ncorners).

They are slowly increasing their relative separation to provide a stereoscopic\nview of solar phenomena, especially CMEs.\nSTEREO carries a wide-angle camera that can track the propagation of CMEs all the way\nfrom near the Sun to Earth. Moreover, the STEREO team discovered that the instrument\ncan track high-density solar wind features as they propagate out from the Sun.\nJoint STEREO and Wind in situ observations connected for the first time solar wind\ncompression regions, observed at 1 AU for many years, with remote-sensing observations\nof density enhancements in the inner heliosphere. This allows the tracking of these solar\nwind structures back towards the Sun and the identification of the point of their formation\nwhen fast streams ram into slower ones. This research is carried out by A. Szabo (672)\nand B. Thompson (671) in collaboration with S. Plunkett of the National Research\nLaboratory (NRL).\n0210 UT (7120107)\t\n2210 UT\t\n^w^\n\n1610 UT (7119/07)\n-.\n\n^.-\n\nWave\n\nL\n\'\t\n\n***\\\n\nVA\n\n11 a\n\n^-\t\n\n1010 UT\t\n\n1.\t\n\nJ-{\n^\n\n0610 UT\t\n,\xe2\x80\xa2.\n\n0410 UT (7120/07)\njy\'R\n\nU\nU\nd\nZ\nC\nO\n00:00:00 12:00:00\t\n00:00:00\t 12:00:00\t\n00:00:00\t 12:00:00\t\n00;00:00 12;00:00\t\n00:00:00\n07 July 18 07 July 18 07 July 19 07 July 19 07 July 20 07 July 20 07 July 21 07 July 21 07 July 22\n\nTime/Date\n\nTime-ordered difference images of the heliosphere taken from STEREO, looking tolvards\nEarth, lvith the Sun just off the pictures to the left.

ST5 is NASA\'s\npathfinder for future missions requiring highly capable,\naffordable, small spacecraft; miniaturized subsystems;\nand constellation mission operations. ST5 was designed\nto show the utility of small satellites by flying a 3microsatellite "string-of-pearls" constellation with\nminiaturized Fluxgate Magnetometers (FGM) aboard.\nThe mission was designed, built, and operated by GSFC.\nAlthough the mission ended after 90 days of operation, the recent ST5 data analysis has\ndemonstrated the first magnetic field gradiometric measurement capabilities:\no First magnetic field gradiometer measurements of field-aligned current intensity\n4\n\nE ; 71\n\n\t\nB\n1.0\n\nST5 - 15 June 2006\n\nA\n\nST5 - 20 June 2006\n\n0.5\n\n2\n\na\n\n0.0\n\n=0\n\n- 094\n_2 - 094-P24\n- 094-155\nTime\n15:30\nAlt(km) 781.0\nMLT(hr) 6.11\nMLAT(\') 72.5\n\n\'\n\n- 094-224\n-094\n- 094-155\n\n15:31\n859.2\n5.89\n68.8\n\n15:32\n941.3\n5.73\n65.1\n\n15:33\n1027.1\n5.62\n61.5\n\n12:58\n4433.5\n3.70\n-60.1\n\n12:59\t 13:00\n4405.7 4375.0\n3.64\t 3.56\n-61.7\t -63.4\n\n0\n13:01 13:02 13:03\n4341.5 4305.2 4266.1\n3.48 3.39 3.28\n-65.1 -66.7 -68.4\n\no First crustal magnetic anomaly measurements using two-point magnetic field\ngradiometer.\nMeasured\nInter-Spacecraft\nDifference\n\nMeasured Field\n40\n\n40\t\n\n36-,t\n\n36\n\n32\n\n32-/\n272\t\n\n276\t\n\n40\t\n\nf\n\nDifference\n40\n\n276\t\n\n40\t\n\n40V\n\n280\n\n36\n\n36\n\n32.\n\n^t\n\n272\t\n\n280\n\nModeled\nInter-Spacecraft\nDifference\n\n32-\n\n272\t\n\n276\t\n\n280\n\n40\t\n\n! {^\n272\t\n\n276\t\n\na.\n\n280\n\n40\n\ni\n30\t\n\n30\t\n\n30\t\n\nFF\n20\n\n240\t\n\n`\t\n250\t\n\n20\t\n\n260 240\t\n\n250\t\n\nJ\n\n20I A\nIR\n\nr 20\t\n260 240\t\n\n14\n\n30\n\n250\t\n\n260 240\t\n\n250\t\n\n260\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nVoyager 2 Crosses the Termination Shock\nThe solar wind plasma is ejected by the Sun\nin all directions at supersonic speeds.

Voyager 1 crossed the termination\nshock in December 2004 at 94 AU; however, Voyager 1 does not have a functioning\nsolar wind plasma detector. Therefore, detailed observation of the termination shock had\nto wait till Voyager 2 crossed it in September\n2007. Since then, Voyager 2 has remained in\nthe heliosheath, the region of shocked solar\nwind. An unexpected finding is that the flow\nthere is still supersonic with respect to the\nthermal ions downstream of the termination\nshock. According to the latest data, the wind\ndownstream of the shock is cooler and faster\nmoving than researchers had anticipated.

Planning began in 1999, and activities begin in 2001,\nculminating in the "year" spanning 2007-2009 [the 50th anniversary of the International\nGeophysical Year (IGY)]. There were IHY\nnational\t committees\t in\t nearly\t 90\t nations\ninvolving the efforts of thousands of scientists.\'\nIn March 2007 the IHY was officially opened,`\nn AGREES\nand what a success it has been!\n\nAMBER\n\nAMMA\nAWESOME\'4^\n\xe2\x80\xa2 CALLISTO\nITNE A\n^ GPS-Africa\no ITNE\n\nA total of 65 science campaigns were initiated\nfor\t the\t IHY,\t including\t the\t "Whole \'MUONAS\nHeliosphere Interval," which involved over\nsAV\xc2\xb0E\nSCINDA\n:\xe2\x80\xa2 ---"\'`\xe2\x80\x94\'100 scientists and 50 instruments.

Each program involved a\nteam of scientists working together on problems of mutual interest. The distributed\ninstrument program, developed through the United Nations Basic Space Science\n(UNBSS) program, facilitated the deployment of a wide range of instrument arrays all\nover the world, including places that were thought to be unreachable (see figure).\n\n16\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\nOf course, outreach and education activities\nwere essential for the development of\nheliophysics worldwide. There were\ntraveling exhibitions, summer schools,\nmuseum partnerships, student-run\nexperiments, online activities, and multilingual materials. Excellent examples of\nthese were activities centered around natural\nphenomena that attract a great deal of public\ninterest.\nAn IGY History program was also\ndeveloped, which recognized individual\nparticipants, gathered historical material, and\nIHY Eclipse Viewing Stations along the path of\ntotality allowed people the opportunity to safely held IGY history events and celebrations\nobserve an eclipse, receive educational materials, worldwide.\nand discuss the event with researchers.\n\nGSFC Role: GSFC scientists perform the\nmajority of the duties of the secretariat. The IHY Executive Director is Joe Davila, the\nInternational Coordinator is Nat Gopalswamy, and the Director of Operations is Barbara\nThompson.\nStatus: IHY\'s official closing ceremony will transpire at the United Nations in Vienna on\n2009 February 18. Transitional activities, which are aimed towards the solidification and\ncontinuance of the IHY legacy, will continue through 2011.\n\n17\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nHeliophysics missions consist of an intricate network of space observatories that\nmonitor the Sun\'s variability and its effects on the entire solar system, life, and\nsociety.\n\nHSD PROJECT LEADERSHIP\nHeliophysics covers a vast volume of space from the center of the Sun to the edge of\ninterstellar space. HSD looks at diverse physical processes from magnetic reconnection to\nparticle acceleration, shock formation to convection, thermal conduction to nonthermal\nheating. This requires the use of many different observing techniques from a variety of\nvenues. In recent years, it has become apparent that little further progress will be made\nunless these phenomena are studied as a "system of systems."\nA fleet of spacecraft, often referred to as the Heliophysics Great Observatory (HGO), are\ncurrently being flown; each spacecraft is addressing a different aspect of the problems\nthat HSD is trying to unravel. Goddard\'s HSD is the nexus of these projects, having a\nmanagement role in all but three of these missions and scientific participation in all of\nthem. See the table below.\n\nThe Heliophysics Great Observatory: Currently, Heliophysics has three missions\nobserving the ionosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere regions; six missions\nobserving the magnetosphere and ionosphere; seven missions sampling the solar\nwind and heliosphere; and six missions observing the Sun. These make up a\npowerful combination of in situ and remote-sensing instruments.\n\n18\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nThe helionhvsics missions flvina in FY08:\nSolar\nSenior Project Scientist: Jim\nTerrestrial\nSlavin (GSFC)\nProbes\nLiving\nSenior Project Scientist: Chris\nWith a Star\nSt. Cyr (GSFC)\nMission\n\nLaunch Date\n\nProject/Mission Scientist\n\nIBEX\nC/NOFS\nAIMW\nTHEMIS\'\nSTEREO\nHinode\nSORCE`\nRHESSI\nTIMED\n\n2008 Oct 19\n2008-Apr-16\n2007-Apr-02\n2007-Feb-17\n2006-Oct-25\n2006-Sep-22\n2003-Jan-25\n2002-Feb-05\n2001-Dec-07\n\nBob MacDowall (GSFC)\nRob Pfaff (GSFC)\nHans Mayr (GSFC)\nDave Sibeck(GSFC)\nMike Kaiser (GSFC)\nJohn Davis (MSFC)\nRobert Callahan (GSFC)\nBrian Dennis (GSFC)\nDick Goldberg (GSFC)\n\nCluster\n\nMel Goldstein (GSFC)\n\nT`\'\'INS\'\nTRACE **\nACE"\n\n2000-Jul-16\n2000-Aug-09\n2000-Mar-25\n1998-Apr-01\n1997-Aug-25\n\nFAST"\nPolar\nSOHO\n\n1996-Aug-21\n1996-Feb-24\n1995-Dec-02\n\n`\'Find\nGeotail\nUlysses\nVoyager 1\nVoyager 2\n\n1994-Nov-01\n1992-Jul-24\n1990-Oct-6\n1977-Sep-05\n1977-Aug-20\n\nMei-Ching Fok (GSFC)\nJoe Gurman (GSFC)\nTycho\t\nvon\t\nRosenvinge\nGSFC\nRob Pfaff (GSFC)\nJohn Sigwarth (GSFC)\nJoe Gunnan (GSFC)\nAdam Szabo (GSFC)\nGuan Le (GSFC)\nEd Smith (JPL)\nEd Stone (JPL)\n\nScientific studies of:\nOuter heliosphere\nIonospheric scintillations\nMesospheric clouds\nSubstorms\nCoronal mass ejections\nSolar magnetic fields\nSolar irradiance\nHigh-energy flares\nThermosphere,\t\nionosphere,\nmesosphere\nmagnetic\t\nfield\nParticle\t\ninteractions\nMagnetosphere\nSolar atmosphere\nSolar wind\nAurora Acceleration\nHigh latitude magnetosphere\nSolar\t interior,\t magnetic\t activity\ncycle, corona, solar hind\nSolar wind\nDynamics of the magnetotail\nSolar wind\nHeliosphere\n\nAppendix 3 is a brief outline (in reverse chronological order) of the purpose and status of\neach of the current heliophysics missions and GSFC\'s role in them.\n\nAIM: Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere\nt THEMIS: Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms\n# SORCE: Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment\n\xc2\xa7 TWINS: Two Wide-Angle Imaging Neutral-Atom Spectrometers\n* TRACE: Transition Region and Coronal Explorer\nACE: Advanced Composition Explorer\nI$ FAST: Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer\n19\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n"The best present is a future"\xe2\x80\x94the next-generation instruments and spacecraft will\ngather data from new vantage points, creating a vibrant future for heliophysics.\n\nDEVELOPING FUTURE HELIOPHYSICS MISSION CONCEPTS\n\nIntroduction\nAt the moment, there are a number of future heliophysics missions in various stages of\ndevelopment. Key to the future of the Heliophysics Great Observatory (HGO) and the\nstrength of this discipline are vitality of its strategic vision and the pipeline of new space\nmissions that are required to realize the vision. These missions always build on past\nscientific achievements and technical capabilities, but it is essential that they produce\nmore than incremental results and that some of the more challenging missions be\nundertaken not in spite of, but rather because of, the challenges they present to\nheliophysics and NASA. All of these missions are part of the Solar Terrestrial Probe\n(STP) or the Living With a Star (LWS) program. Heliophysics is a partner, with\nAstrophysics, in the Explorer program (e.g., TRACE and RHESSI) and expects a steady\nstream of grass-roots-developed, external Principal Investigator led Explorer missions\nthat will achieve more focused, nearer-term science objectives. There are also mission-ofopportunity payloads on other Government and commercial spacecraft, and\ncollaborations involving international missions (e.g., Hinode and SOHO). There are also\nNASA space technology development programs and the New Millennium program (e.g.,\nST5), but these are beyond the scope of this document.\nThe next generation HGO\nelements. Two missions will\nfocus on the Ionosphere,\nMesophere, and Thermosphere\nregions; three missions will\nsolve key questions regarding\nmagnetic reconnection and\ncharged particle acceleration\nin the magnetosphere; four\nmissions will measure the\nsolar wind determine its\nacceleration mechanism in the\ncorona, and evolution as it\nmoves out into the heliosphere;\nand four missions will probe\nthe ouster layers of the Sun, its\natmosphere, and the eruption\nof flares and coronal mass\nejections. The missions marked\nin yellow are currently just\nconcepts that are being\ndeveloped and are not yet in\nformulation.\n\n20\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nThe heliophysics missions planned to fly beyond FY08:\nMission\n\nPlanned\n\nProject/Mission Scientist\n\nScientific Studies of:\n\nDean Pesnell (GSFC)\nBarry Mauk (APL)\nMel Goldstein (GSFC)\nChris St. Cyr (GSFC)\nRobert Decker (APL)\nAdam Szabo (GSFC)\nTBD\n\nLaunch\n\nSDO \'\nRBSP\'/ITSP^\nMMS\'\nSolar Orbiter\nSolar Probe+\nSentinels\nSolar C\n\n2009\n2012\n2013\n2017\n2018\n2017\nConcept\n\nMMC"\n\nConcept\n\nTBD\n\nSolar magnetic fields, corona\nEarth\'s radiation belts\nMagnetosphere\nHi-res solar imaging\nOrigin of the solar NN-ind\nSolar Wind / CMEs\nHigh solar latitudes imaging or\natmospheric spectroscopy\nEarth\'s\t\nelectrodynamic\nenvironment\nGlobal magnetosphere processes\n\nInterstellar\n\nConcept\n\nTBD\n\nOuter heliosphere\n\nConcept\n\nTBD\n\nActivity cycles of Sun-like stars\n\nGEC\n\nTBD\n\nProbe\n\nStellar Imager\n\nThe nature and timing of the missions may well change as a result of the NASA\nHeliophysics Roadmap study and the National Research Council (NRC) decadal survey.\nAppendix 4 provides some of the details of each of these missions.\n\nSDO: Solar Dynamics Observatory\nt RBSP: Radiation Belt Storm Probes\n$ ITSP: Ionosphere-Trospo sphere Storm Probes\nMMS Magnetospheric Multiscale\n* GEC: Geospace Electrodynamics Connections\ntt MMC: Magnetosphere Mission Concept\n21\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nUsing NASA missions and activities to inspire, engage, educate, and employ is a key\ncomponent in creating a vibrant future for heliophysics.\n\nHELIOPHYSICS EDUCATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH\nSignificant opportunities exist to extend the impact of heliophysics science and related\nmission activities to engage and inspire students in formal education settings, audiences\nat informal learning centers, and the general public across the nation via the press and\nother communication outlets. The complexity of heliophysics requires a systems\napproach, and our E/PO efforts must mirror this challenge. In FY08, the Division has\ntaken steps to focus and invigorate its outreach activities by creating an E/PO leadership\nposition\xe2\x80\x94Associate Director for Science\xe2\x80\x94filled by Dr. Holly Gilbert. Under the lead of\nDr. Gilbert, the Heliophysics E/PO will show an increase in coordination in the\ndevelopment and evaluation of HSD\'s programs and products. Heliophysics outreach\ngoals are to:\no Communicate heliophysics scientific discoveries and advances\no Raise public understanding of space weather impacts\no Inspire the next generation of American space scientists\nThese goals can be reached by strategically integrating components of Education (K-12,\nhigher education, and informal education) and Public Outreach (e.g., media). Strong\nuniversity relationships also play a key role in HSD\'s success, including adjunct support,\nfaculty visitors, and interactions created during sabbaticals spent at university.\n\nEducation\nSummer Programs\nThrough many different summer programs offered (which will be integrated into one\nlarge summer program starting in FY09), heliophysicists supported over 11 summer\ninterns (high school and undergraduate) in addition to several graduate students through\nthe Graduate Student Summer Program.\nCo-op\nThe Cooperative Education Program is an important link in the educational process that\nintegrates college level academic study with frill-time meaningful work experience. This\nis achieved through a working agreement between GSFC and a number of educational\ninstitutions. HSD supported three Co-op students in FY08.\nPostgraduate Programs\no GSRP: The Graduate Student Researchers Program provides qualified graduate\nstudents, in residence at their home institutions, with fellowship support on research\nprojects of mutual interest to the student and the GSFC mentor. HSD currently\nsupports seven GSRP students.\no NPP: The NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) provides talented postdoctoral\nscientists and engineers with valuable opportunities to engage in ongoing NASA\nresearch programs. HSD currently has 15 NPP staff members.\n\n22\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nPublic Outreach\nGiven the large number of missions in the heliophysics fleet, all of the mission-related\noutreach activities in a report of this scope cannot be listed, but a few illustrative\nexamples are provided:\no Community Events at Professional Science Meetings: The SDO team, in\npartnership with the Rochester Institute of Technology Center for Imaging Science\nInsight Lab and with support from the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and the\nAmerican Geophysical Union (AGU) has implemented two new E/PO programs held\nprior to each of the AAS and AGU meetings. The Educator Reception is an\nopportunity for local teachers to interact one-on-one with traveling scientists. During\nthe reception, the teachers can obtain materials to take back to the classroom to excite\ntheir students in current science. AstroZone and Exploration Station are each a 4-hour\nopen house for local families, aimed at making science more accessible to the general\npublic and increasing public awareness of the current science being performed. The\nfirst Exploration Station was held at the joint AGU/SPD * meeting in Ft. Lauderdale,\nand the third AstroZone was held at the AAS meeting in St. Louis. These two\nprograms will now each be held twice a year. Emilie Drobnes (SDO E/PO Lead)\npresented a paper on the Exploration Station and AstroZone programs at the\ninternational Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) meeting in July in Montreal.\no Data Distribution: as part of the SOHO/STEREO Pick of the Week feature,\nSTEREO images and movies are often sent out to over 230 museums and science\ncenters through ViewSpace kiosks and the American Museum of Natural History\'s\nAstroBulletins. Handouts and 3-D movies from STEREO were showcased at\nGoddard Day in Annapolis, Maryland; Goddard\'s LaunchFest; NASA Night at the\nAir and Space Museum; the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)\nConvention; and the Association of Science Technology Centers conference. Highresolution STEREO footage was provided to several production companies for\ndisplays and TV productions.\no Distance Learning Network: the Endeavour Program, a collaboration between\nSTEREO/NASA and selected middle-school students from 18 school systems in\nnortheastern Pennsylvania, offered student teams learning opportunities with a NASA\nsolar mission. This involved receiving a distance learning (DLN) overview of\nSTEREO and 3-D imagery. The student teams conduct research on the mission and\nspace weather, make their own 3-D images, and present their images and explain how\nSTEREO is advancing solar science, also via DLN. A similar program engaged\nmiddle school students in several other Pennsylvania school districts in 2008.\no Web: SOHO Explore is the SOHO education and outreach Web site, including an\nintroduction to "Our Star the Sun" with images and videos, activities, and lesson\nplans using SOHO data, educational materials, and an "Ask Dr. SOHO" feature.\n* SPD: Solar Physics Division of the AAS\n23\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nGeneral Outreach Activities\nFamily Science Night\nFamily Science Night is a 2-hour monthly program for middle school students and their\nfamilies designed to change their perceptions of science and how they respond to science.\nThe FY09 season will serve as final testing of the program, facilitator guides, and\nevaluation tools. HSD hopes to begin a first round of dissemination next summer. The\nFamily Science Night team, led by SDO E/PO Lead Emily Drobnes, received the Robert\nH. Goddard award at the September 10th ceremony.\nSunday Experiment\nThe Sunday Experiment is a 4-hour open house for the DC metro area.\nA\nDuring the event, visitors participate in various hands-on activities set up\nthroughout the museum at the GSFC Visitor Center. The goal of this\nprogram is to expose the local community to GSFC and to begin to\nchange their perceptions of science and scientists. It is hoped that this\n3 program can serve as a hook into other GSFC programs, such as Family\nScience Night and the model rocket event, and start to build a GSFC\nE/PO pipeline of sorts.\n\nMuseum Alliance: The Smithsonian Folklife Festival\nThe 42nd Annual Smithsonian Folklife\nFestival was held 2008 June 25\xe2\x80\x94July 6 on\nthe National Mall in Washington, D.C. The\nHeliophysics Division was well represented\nas several scientists and E/PO experts\nvolunteered for the 10-day event that\nattracted over one million festival attendees.\nThe solar telescope was the hit of the space\nscience area. Other hands-on materials, such\nas the 3-1) compasses for mapping out\nmagnetic fields, were also very popular.\nLaunchFest 2008\nThousands converged on GSFC in September 2008 to celebrate LaunchFest, where\nexhibits and activities demonstrated Goddard\'s many current and future missions.\nHeliophysics activities, specifically the "Walk on the Sun" exhibit about STEREO and\nthe STEREO exhibit showing 3-D animations of the Sun, were extremely popular.\n\nSun\xe2\x80\x94Earth Connection Education Forum\nThe Sun\xe2\x80\x94Earth Connection Education Forum (SECEF) is a partnership between GSFC\nand University of California Berkeley\'s Space Sciences Laboratory. SECEF brings\ntogether the rich expertise of scientists, educators, and museums to develop innovative\nproducts and programs with the goal to increase science literacy and focus attention on\n\n24\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\nthe active Sun and its effects on Earth. An example of a successful SECEF activity is\nSun\xe2\x80\x93Earth Day:\nSun\xe2\x80\x93Earth Day is an annual national event (usually in March) supported by the SECEF,\nSun-Solar-System-Connection scientists, and spacecraft missions. The goal is to share the\nscience of the Sun with educators, students, and the general public via informal learning\ncenters, the Web, television, etc., through high-profile, well-supported annual events. For\nSun\xe2\x80\x93Earth Day 2008, SECEF involved a worldwide audience in the celebration of the\nIHY, "Space Weather Around the World." Mission science and mission-developed\nresources were highlighted on the Web site and in the 15,000 packets that were\ndistributed widely and used for training in educator workshops. Through podcasts, a\nquarter of a million individuals were reached. On 2008 August 1, the Sun\xe2\x80\x93Earth Day\nteam, with support from GSFC\'s Public Affairs Office and NASA TV, co-produced with\nthe Exploratorium a Web cast of the total solar eclipse from China.\n\nPublic Media\nGSFC\'s outstanding data visualization team\xe2\x80\x94the Scientific Visualization Studio\n(SVS)produces superior quality images, animations, and data visualizations in support\nof a wide range of heliophysics communications and science activities, including NASA\nPublic Affairs press releases, live presentations, various print publications, television, and\nvideo documentaries. In FY08, new animations and visualizations were created to\ndescribe mission science, for example, from IBEX, THEMIS, and SDO, allowing the\ncomplete, complex, heliophysics story to be told in a way that is understandable to the\npublic.\nOther successes of FY08 include over 50 stories (in press releases, www.nasa.gov , and\nscience.nasa.gov), written by HSD\'s Public Affairs writing team, which was made\npossible by a significant investment in heliophysics writing support. NASA heliophysics\nhas a direct conduit to spaceweather.com audiences through support of writer Tony\nPhillips. This coordination is allowing HSD to make greater impact and obtain greater\nattention for heliophysics science results.\nIn FY08, two live-shot campaigns (live TV scientist interviews with TV stations around\nthe country) were produced, one based on auroras and incorporating the THEMIS\nmission, and the other based on the 2008 eclipse. Additionally, for the first time in 2008\nHSD produced vodcasts (i.e., video podcasts) for YouTube, iTunes, and www.nasa.gov\nfor some of the major heliophysics stories. The vodcast for the 2008 eclipse got 100,000\nviews on YouTube, and an eclipse preview featuring SDO had 80,000 page views.\nTHEMIS also benefited from vodcasts. The Associated Press picked up the vodcast titled,\n"THEMIS: Spring is Aurora Season" resulting in coverage on almost every news site:\nhttp://www.nasa. gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/aurora\xe2\x80\x93live.html.\n\n25\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nThe congruence of expertise and experience in HSD makes it a natural center for\nleadership in the design and implementation of science information systems.\n\nSCIENCE INFORMATION SYSTEMS\nNASA builds and flies heliophysics spacecraft and instruments to collect observational\ndata and increase understanding of the heliophysical system and its detailed processes as\ncan be pictured in a classic research wheel.\n\nToday\'s special heliophysics science challenge is to consistently understand the physics\nand coupling of this "system of systems" over many spatial and time scales. Science\ninformation systems are key to drawing data and science both from individual science\ninvestigations and across the boundaries of the individual missions and instruments of the\nHeliophysics Great Observatory (HGO) now operated by NASA. In addition, NASA\'s\nHeliophysics Data Policy (see links on http://hpde.gsfc.nasa.gov) demands open and\nuseful access to NASA data by the broad NASA and international science research\ncommunity to ensure full science return to the public on NASA\'s investment in science\nmissions and investigations.\nThe congruence of instrument design, physics, modeling, data analysis, and information\ntechnology expertise and experience in HSD makes it a natural center for leadership in\nthe design and implementation of science information systems (SIS) working in close\npartnership with the external science and technology communities. Categories for\nsystems currently defined in the Heliophysics Data Policy include the following:;\n26\n\n\t\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\no Mission/Investigation Data Facilities\no Virtual Discipline Observatories (VxOs)\no Resident and Final Archives\no Science Data and Modeling Centers\no Deep Archive(s)\nThe evolving heliophysics data vision is a distributed set of mission and investigation\ndata facilities closely tied to the scientists responsible for active processing of data,\ncoordinated with active archives and data centers joined together by Virtual Discipline\nObservatory (VXO) data location, and retrieval and user services to ensure easy\nconsolidated access to usable data with views of the data customized to research\ndiscipline needs. In general, the HSD expects to leverage existing capabilities and\nservices wherever practical, but to also support the introduction of new technology to\nenable a more distributed architecture. The first versions of the VxOs are intended to\nfollow a "small-box" model focused on helping users find and retrieve fully described\ndata relevant to their research needs (e.g., selected by times with parameters in a given\ndata range from a selection of instruments).\nMission and investigation data facilities\nunder HSD direction include\n0\n\nSolar Data Analysis Center (SDAC )Dat(XML)\nNt^\nquery\t\n1xMU\t\nsupport for SOHO and SOHO/EIT,\nV50 Rea [ry\t\nSche\t\n50AC\t\nsolar instruments on STEREO, and\t\nRepository)\t\ndata from TRACE, Hinode, and -\n\nquery\t\n\nother missions\t\n\nquery\t\n\nquery\n\nvu It\t\n\nresult\n\n411111.\t\n\na Sernce\n,he\n\nV50\nUs e,\nes\t\noptions\n\n5\n\n\\\n\n0\n0\n\nBrowser\nSTEREO Science Center (SSC) \t\ne,lrer,\t\n1n1ef,dCe\nsupport\t\nSDO\'s\nCritical\t\nfor\t\nData\nThe "small box"\t\nUser\ndistributed\t science\t archive\t and\t services\t\ndistribution system\n0 Operation of the Wind-Geotail (Polar-Wind-Geotail) ground data system\n0 Production of higher-level Wind (MFI, SWE electron, WAVES), Voyager (MAG\nCRS), and STEREO (SWAVES) instrument products\n0 C/NOFS-CINDI data production\n\nTwo key HSD projects, the Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF) and SDAC serve as\nbroad-based and heavily used, multi-mission, active archive and distribution projects for\nnon-solar and solar imaging data respectively.

The SPDF project now supports the Virtual Space Physics Observatory interface,\nwhich is a need identified in the Heliophysics Data Policy to comprehensively identify\nand make "user findable" a frill set of heliophysics data holdings across these disciplines\nleveraging both the present inventories of the individual VxOs and other information.\nThe overall goal is to make better data more readily findable and usable for researchers in\na given discipline across the boundaries of specific missions, instruments, and times. This\nwill be done by using an optimal mix of existing capabilities with appropriate standards\nand new technology to improve data access, and by using tighter coupling to the dataproviding community to ensure data are fiilly and properly described for correct and\nindependent future research use. HSD is looking forward to 1) closer coupling of data to\nmodels, 2) the more extensive use of distributed services through which data can piped\nfor specific processing or other added value, 3) an ongoing effort to define lower-cost\nscience ground-system design and implementation approaches, and 4) more sophisticated\nonboard data capabilities that can lead towards what are sometimes termed "sensorwebs"\namong active instruments.\n\n28\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nCOMMUNITY COORDINATED MODELING CENTER\nThe Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) is a US interagency activity\naiming at research in support of the generation of advanced space weather models. The\nCCMC consortium consists of NASA, NSF * , NOAAT, the US Air Force (USAF) Weather\nAgency, Directorate of Weather, Space and Missiles System Center, the Air Force\nResearch Laboratory, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the Office of\nNaval Research. CCMC\'s central facility is located at GSFC. The CCMC is supported\nprimarily by NASA and by NSF. At the present time, CCMC staff is 10 FTE strong,\nconsisting of space and computer scientists and Information Technology professionals.\nThe first function of the CCMC is to provide a mechanism by which research models can\nbe validated, tested, and improved for eventual use in space weather forecasting, such as\nneeded for NASA\'s Vision for Space Exploration. Models that have completed their\ndevelopment and passed metrics-based evaluations and science-based validations are\nbeing handed off to the forecasting centers at NOAA and the US Air Force for space\nweather applications. In this function, CCMC acts as an unbiased evaluator that bridges\nthe gap between space science research and space weather applications.\nAs a second, equally important function, the CCMC provides to space science researchers\nall over the world the use of space science models, even if they are not model owners\nthemselves. This service to the research community is implemented through the\nexecution of model "runs-on-request" for specific events of interest to space science\nresearchers at no\nHellospheric\ncost to the requestor.\t\nTomography\nModel output is\nmade available to the\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2.\nscience customer by\nmeans of tailored\nanalysis tools and\ndata dissemination in\nstandard\t\nformats.\nThrough this activity WSWI\nand the concurrent\ndevelopment\t\nof\nadvanced visualiOverview of models at the CCMC.\nzation\t\ntools,\nCCMC provides to the general science community unprecedented access to a large\nnumber of state-of-the-art research models. The continuously expanding model set\nincludes models in all scientific domains from the solar corona to Earth\'s upper\natmosphere.\n\n* NSF: National Science Foundation\nt NOAA: National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n29\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nScience Support\nCCMC science services are provided through Web access (http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov ).\nHere, users can request calculations from more than 25 modern space science models,\nwhich are hosted at the CCMC through very positive collaborations with their owners.\nAfter a run request, a user will be notified via e-mail once the calculation is complete. At\nthis time, the nun can be analyzed via tailored visualization tools, again via Web access.\nThese tools have been continuously refined for almost 10 years, primarily in response to\nuser requests. Recently added capabilities include Poynting flux calculations, model\noutputs, field-line tracing along satellite trajectories, and movie generation.\nThe utilization of CCMC\nRun-on-Request services\ncontinues to grow rapidly.\n\nRuns on Request Cumulative Growth as of Nov 2008\n2500\n\nCCMC run analysis services\nare also used heavily. In\n2008, an average month saw\n4,200 visitors, 19,200 visits,\nand 262,000 requests for\npages. Visualization requests\nfrom 870 users led to the\ncreation of 34,500\nvisualization pages each\nThese monthly\nmonth.\t\naverages\t\ncontinue\t\nto\nincrease from year to year.\n\nq Global Magnetosphere\no Ionosphere/Then nos phere\nn Inner Magnetosphere\nSolar and Heliosphere\n\n2000\t\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n2001\t\n\n2003\t\n\n2005\nYear\n\n2007\n\nCumulative RoR oroivth\n\nFurthermore, the CCMC staff is continuing to develop new means to support users in\ntheir scientific studies. In the realm of visualization, OpenDx-based visualization with\nenhanced 3-D capabilities is now available for a number of different model outputs. With\nboth OpenDx and IDL-based 3-D visualizations, users can request output in Virtual\nReality Modeling Language (VRML) form, which permits real-time in-depth analysis of\ncomplex 3-D structures.\nFurther science services at the CCMC include the provision of the Model Web, where a\nlarge set of empirical or analytical models, such as the International Reference\nIonosphere (IRI), are available for interested users for download or execution. CCMC is\nalso supporting space science missions, for example STEREO and THEMIS. Science\nmission support includes background science infonnation derived from routine runs, or\ncalculations in support of specific campaigns or specific science objectives.\nAs in the past, the fiuture of CCMC services will be shaped by the needs of the science\ncommunity. Community input is solicited formally and informally, through meetings,\ntailored workshops, and personal contacts.\n\n30\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nSpace Weather Modeling\nThe second focus of CCMC is related to the need to bring modern space science\nmodeling to bear on the needs of space weather forecasting. Forecasting agencies need\nmodels of proven forecasting abilities. Operational models must be robust, have\naccuracies that are well understood, and be packaged in a way that makes them easy to\nintegrate into existing computational environments. The operational models must also be\ncapable of executing reliably in real time. With these objectives, the CCMC tests models\nfor accuracy, robustness, performance, and portability. Model accuracy is tested in two\nways, through metric studies and through scientific validation studies. As a result, the\nCCMC can characterize the usefulness of these models for the forecasting role to which\nthey would be applied. By testing how the models behave with a wide range of inputs, the\nCCMC can establish regimes in which the models appear robust and can identify regimes\nthat cause the models to fail. Through exposure to a range of compilers and hardware\nplatforms, the CCMC improves the portability of these models. Finally, by measuring\ncomputational performance, the CCMC establishes the conditions needed for each model\nsimulation to complete in real time or better.\nExperimental Real-Time Tools:\t\n\nPerfonning these types of\n\nhttp:/\'swan.gsfc.nasa.gov\t\n\nanalyses on models in a\nprotected\t\nacademic\nenvironment might produce\n\nModels run in real-time with\t\noutputs available through:\n\nthan objective results.\nIt is imperative that these\nDownloadable Widgets\n\xc2\xae\t\nmodels undergo tests in an\nenvironment that stresses\nthem in the same fashion as\n- -\t\n=\t\nwill occur at the operational\nagencies.

This information is provided to any interested entity\non the Space Weather Awareness at NASA (SWAN) Web site: http://swan.gsfc.nasa.gov .\nOwing to the diversity of space weather-relevant information sources, space weather\nanalysis and forecasting will, in the future, increasingly rely on access to distributed\ninformation providers. The SWAN site is a first step in this direction of information\ncollection. While it, along with further development activities supported by NASA\'s\nOffice of Chief Engineer, addresses NASA\'s needs primarily, this information can also\nsupport governmental as well as commercial space weather interests. CCMC, therefore,\nhas ongoing collaborations with USAF, NOAA, international space weather interests, and\ncommercial enterprises in the US. An example of the latter is the Electrical Power\nResearch Institute (EPRI), which, in a jointly funded activity, collaborates in the\nevaluation of space weather modeling products for power grid uses.\nMore information about the CCMC may be found at the CCMC Web site\nhttp://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov .\n\n32\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT\nGoddard Space Flight Center and NASA in general support new technology in the\nHeliophysics division through three programs. The main source of support is the GSFC\nInternal Research and Development (IRAD) program, which fiends the development of\nnew technology to support proposals to be submitted to future announcements of\nopportunity. The Technical Equipment program provides funding for purchases of\nadvanced technology equipment and replacement of outdated equipment needed to\nsupport the development of new instrumentation. The Small Business Innovative\nResearch (SBIR) program provides funding to develop new flight hardware and software\nconcepts in the commercial sector in support of future flight opportunities.\nThe IRAD program of GSFC runs on an annual basis for each fiscal year. An\nannouncement of opportunity is released in early June describing the requirements of the\nopportunity for the subsequent fiscal year. Step-1 proposals are submitted in late June. A\nproposal review panel lead by Dr. John Sigwarth, the Chief Science Technologist for the\nHeliophysics Science Division, meets in July to rank the proposals and recommend to the\nCenter-wide integration panel those proposals that should progress to the second phase.\nStep-2 proposals are submitted in late July. The review panel meets again in early August\nto rank the Step-2 proposals and recommend funding to the Center-wide integration\npanel. Funding approval by the Center-wide integration panel is contingent on the\navailable resources and the relative ranking of the Heliophysics Science Division\nproposals with respect to other focus areas within GSFC. In FY08, a total of 17 Step-1\nproposals were submitted, resulting in 7 projects funded by the GSFC IRAD program. An\nadditional project was added halfway through the year. For these winning projects, the\nFY08 IRAD funded a total of 11.7 FTEs and an additional $606.5 K for procurements in\nsupport of the selected IRAD proposals. In FY09, a total of 15 Step-1 proposals were\nsubmitted resulting in 7 projects funded by the GSFC IRAD program. For these winning\nprojects, the FY09 IRAD program funded a total of 11.8 FTEs and an additional $434.5K\nfor procurements in support of the selected IRAD proposals.\nThe new technologies supported by the GSFC IRAD program cover a broad range of\nheliophysics topics. These technologies include new neutral-to-ion conversion surfaces in\na venetian blind configuration for miniaturization of neutral-atom imagers; plasma\nimpedance spectrum analyzers with state-of-the-art electronics to process the\nobservations onboard and determine the ionospheric plasma density and temperature at\nhigh cadence; a Far Ultraviolet (FUV) Fabry Perot interferometer, extremely high line\ndensity reflective grating, and electron-multiplying Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) for\nmeasuring the Doppler-broadened line width of thermospheric emissions; the\ndemonstration of the next-generation coronagraph that will extract additional information\nabout electron temperatures and flow speeds from observations of the visible light\nspectrum; design of a new low-mass, low-power ionospheric sounder; and development\nof a data compression application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), fast-stepping high\nvoltage power supplies, and particle detector optics.\n\n33\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\nThree of the instruments selected for FY08 IRAD funding have involved students of the\nUS Naval Academy. Because of this cooperation, the Thermospheric Temperature\nImager (TTI), the Plasma Impedance Spectrum Analyzer (PISA), and the Miniature\nImager for Neutral Ionospheric atoms and Magnetospheric Electrons (MINI-ME) have\nbeen briefed to the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense (DoD) Space\nExperiment Review Boards (SERB) and selected to be included on the respective SERB\nlists. As a direct consequence of this inclusion on the SERB list, TTI, PISA, and MINIME will fly on a Space Test Program spacecraft in December 2009.\nThe GSFC Technical Equipment program is run on an annual fiscal year basis to\npurchase new capital equipment or replace obsolete equipment. Each year suggestions for\nequipment purchases are solicited from HSD members. These requests are ranked by the\nHSD management and brou ght forward to the Science and Exploration Directorate. In\nFY08, approximately $200K was allocated for technical equipment purchases within\nHSD. In FY08, the technical equipment fund within the HSD was oversubscribed by\n300%.\nThe SBIR program within NASA provides an opportunity for small, high technology\ncompanies to participate in Government-sponsored research and development (R&D)\nefforts in key technology areas. New technology needs for HSD are identified by\nmembers within the division and vetted by GSFC- and NASA-wide integration panels.\nSolicitations based on the identified key technology areas are released annually. Selected\nSBIR companies work with the oversight of the Contracting Officer\'s Technical\nRepresentative to achieve the desired technology goals. For FY08, two SBIR proposals\nwere selected in the area of heliophysics.\n\n34\n\n\t\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nAPPENDIX 1: INDIVIDUAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\nThe following section contains some short summaries of the research work of the\nscientists working in HSD.

Because it is a complicated\nnonlinear process, much of what has been learned about collisionless\nreconnection has come from simulation studies. From these studies, a\n"Hall reconnection model" has emerged as the generally accepted\nparadigm for this process. Recently, however, simulations done with\nopen, rather than the traditional periodic boundary conditions have\nchallenged the Hall reconnection model. The purpose of the current,\nongoing research is to modify an available electromagnetic 2/zdimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) reconnection simulation code to incorporate open\nboundaries and then to investigate this recent challenge to the Hall reconnection model\nusing the modified code.\nWe have developed a new, and far more general, algorithm for open boundaries in PIC\nsimulation codes. A simple method that allows passage of particles through an open\nboundary while maintaining a zero normal gradient for the particle distributions has been\ndeveloped. The biggest difficulty with this construct is keeping track of particles lost and\ngained but this can be done with very little additional computational load. In addition,\ncompatible boundary conditions have been imposed on the electromagnetic field at the\nopen boundaries. We have achieved smooth passage of electromagnetic structures\n(magnetic islands, outflow jets, etc.) through the boundaries with no trace of charge\nbuildup near the boundaries or anywhere else on the computational grid.\nThe newly available collisionless reconnection simulation code with open boundaries is\nperforming well and is being used at present to investigate the recent challenge to the\nHall reconnection paradigm.\nJim Klimchuk\nDr. Klimchuk joined\nthe Solar Physics Lab\nin early January of\n2008.

Because the\nsolar corona is optically thin, coronal observations are essentially\nn\nri\nintegrated over the line-of-sight (LOS). It is therefore impossible to\nresolve the structure of the corona along the LOS if observations are\nprovided from a single view direction. Observations from different\nview positions are necessary to reconstruct the 3-D coronal structure\nand is the essence of the tomography inversion method.\nWhen observations are only from a single\nview direction, a rigid rotation of the\ncoronal density structures with the Sun\nabout the ecliptic must be assumed in order\nto apply the tomography technique. As a\nconsequence, only structures that are\nstationary over half a solar rotation can be\nreconstructed. The obtained electron density\nstructure could be used for testing coronal\nmodels as the reconstruction reflects nearly\nreal coronal density structure within\nassumptions described above. Results of this\nwork have been described in a paper that\nwas submitted for publication in Solar\nPhysics.\n\nIsosnrface of the electron density in the solar\ncorona at vahie 3.6 x 1010 m-3 for- the period of\nCarrington Rotation 2058.

The first two of these\nbenefited from experience with the others, which came together in a\nstudy reporting the first magnetospheric simulation to include all\nrelevant observed plasmas: solar wind, polar wind, auroral wind, and\nplasmaspheric wind. The newest element simulated was the plasmaspheric wind, created\nwhen reconnection with the solar wind magnetic field liberates plasmas usually trapped\ndeep in the magnetosphere (the plasmasphere), circulating them to the magnetospheric\nboundary layers, where they are lost downstream, or re-circulated through the\nmagnetotail to the inner magnetosphere with large increases in particle energy. The\nsurprising result was that the plasmasphere makes a small contribution to the storm time\nplasma pressure inflating the inner magnetosphere, comparable to that of the polar wind.\nThis work was the subject of two invited talks and one contributed talk, and was\ndesignated the most striking result to come out of the LWS TR&T-focused science team\nactivity in 2008.\n\n* TIDE: Thermal Ion Dynamics Experiment\n72\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n2003 Nov 20-21 H+ Plasmasphere Field Line Release. 4 million particles\nFrame 000.0\t\n\nTime 03:00.0\t\n\nFraFTle 218.1\t\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\nCu\n\nTime 17:33.0\n\nY= 0 plane\n20\n\n10\n\nw 10\n\n0\n\n0\n\nm\nN .10\n\nN 10\n\n-20\n\n-70\n\n1\t\n\n-30\n\n-30\n\n0 Z\n\n3\n2\n\nc\n-1 O\n\nZ= 0 plane\n30\n\nE\nw\n\nm\n}\n\nto\n\n-2\n\n20\n\nW\n\nE\n\n2D\n\n-3\n\n10\n\nw 10\n\n-4\n\nS\n\n0\n\nE 0\nN\n> -10\n\n10\n-20\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-30\n-60\t\n\n-40\t\n\n-20\t\nXg ,m (RF)\n\n0\t\n\n20\n\n-60\t\n\n-20\t\nXgsm (RE)\n\n0\t\n\n20\n\nA comparison of the normal plasmasphere (left panels) with the circulating\nplasmasphere, which results fi-om storm time circulation in the Earth\'s magnetosphere\n(right panels).

During FY08, his main research activities\ninvolved the successful launch and operation of the Vector Electric\nField Investigation (VEFI) instrument suite on the C/NOFS satellite\n_ that was launched in April 2008 into a low latitude (13\xc2\xb0 inclination)\norbit with perigee and apogee of 401 and 867 km, respectively. Dr.\nPfaff is the PI of VEFI that returns vector DC and AC electric fields,\nmagnetic fields, relative plasma density, and optical lightning flash\ncount rates. The main objective of the instrument and the C/NOFS\nmission is to investigate the nature and cause(s) of low latitude ionospheric irregularities,\nas well as to provide data to be used to predict their occurrence.\nAs part of his LWS Targeted Research and Technology (TR&T) grant, Dr. Pfaff\ndemonstrated how low and mid-latitude irregularities are associated with magnetic storms\non a global basis (i.e., simultaneously at low and mid latitudes), as illustrated in the\nattached figure and discussed in Pfaff et al., 2008.\nIn FY08, Dr. Pfaff prepared two comprehensive, vector electric field experiments, for\nwhich he was the instrument PI, which were successfully launched into the active cusp\non two simultaneous sounding rockets from Andoya, Norway in December 2007 (Dr. C.\nKletzing, Univ. of Iowa, was the mission PI). The electric field experiments were both\nhighly successful, returning DC and AC electric fields (including measurements of high\nfrequency [HF] Langmuir waves) and absolute plasma density data.\nElectric field and impedance probe experiments were also prepared in FY08 in\nGoddard\'s electric field laboratory for two auroral zone sounding rocket experiments\nwith simultaneous launches planned for January 2009, from Poker Flat, Alaska.\nDr. Pfaff serves as the Project Scientist on the FAST mission, the CINDI investigation on\nC/NOFS, and the NASA Sounding Rocket Program.

These images can be reduced to extract surface\nmanifestations of internal convection mechanisms, seen as either\ngranule or supergranule cells. Of interest are various characteristics of\nthese features such as their sizes, lifetimes, and advection properties.\nCurrent work involves the study of these, and similar, characteristics\nthrough an entire solar cycle to gain insight into how these surface\nfeatures are influenced by changes in the global magnetic field of the\nSun. Supergranules are significant in such studies as there is clear evidence of magnetic\nfield interactions within, and at the boundaries of, such cells. A recent result has been the\ncharacterization of instrumental artifacts within the image that may be removed, along\nwith the stronger velocity components of granules and supergranules, to aid the\nobservational investigations of, hitherto elusive, giant cells.\n\n1\nDoppler-\t velocity\t image\t (tapper\t left)\nilhrstrating floivs toward (bhre) and aivay\nf om (red_) the observer at the surface of\nthe Sun.

She is currently maintaining the COR1 preliminary CME\ncatalog working with Dr. Chris St. Cyr. Her research interests include\n_\t\nthe origin, three-dimensional structure, and evolution of CMEs. She\n{ has developed a new analytical CME cone model fitting procedure,\nand incorporated a geometrical flux-rope model for STEREOXOR\ncoronagraph images. Working with Dr. Gopalswamy and Dr. St. Cyr,\nshe studied the effects of solar wind dynamic pressure on large\ngeomagnetic stories and the resulting paper was published in\nGeophysical Research Letters during 2008. She has also analyzed and compared different\nproperties of radio-loud CME-driven shocks and radio-quiet CME-driven shocks. By\nusing flux-rope models and numerical simulations with ENLIL+Cone model, she has\ninvestigated 3-D structure and kinematic evolution of the May-13-2005 CME and\ncorresponding magnetic cloud, and the results have been presented at the SHINE\nworkshop and IAU 257 symposium.\n\nBroadside morphology (middle) and edge on morphology (right) of the flux rope model (courtesy ofDr.\nKrall\'s flux-rope model code) for the 2007 December 31 CME.

Alex Young\n4\t\n`^+\t\nDr. Young, of ADNET Systems Inc., works to develop signal and\nVL\t\n,. image processing methods and software to facilitate a more complete\nf\t\nextraction of scientific information from solar physics data. This is to\naid both the community as a whole, as well as his own research into the\nt\t\nw\t\nprediction and understanding of dynamic phenomena in the solar\ncorona such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Dr. Young has\nrecently been awarded a NASA grant to develop tools and methods for\nr\t\nthe analysis of STEREO image data. He was also awarded a NASA\ngrant to support the 4th workshop of the Solar Image Processing\nWorkshop series, held October 2008 in Baltimore, Maryland. This workshop brought\ntogether over 70 scientists and image processing experts from around the world. In\naddition, Dr. Young was a guest editor of a Solar Physics Journal special issue in April\n2008, which contained papers from some of the material presented at the 3rd Solar Image\nProcessing Workshop. Over 2008, he published several journal papers on his work. His\nwork has included educational outreach both in the form of mentoring several\nundergraduate and graduate students, and giving interviews for NASA TV and the\n\nDiscovery Channel.\n2000 January 2\n\n\t\n\n2000 April 18\n\nSample fits to the leading edge of\nCoronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)\nobserved by the Large Angle and\nSpectrometric Coronograph (LASCO)\ninstrument aboard SOHO.

Of these, 44% (93)\nhave been with HSD scientists as first author. HSD has submitted or has in press a further\n70 articles (28 of which are first author publications). A comprehensive list of these\npapers is listed in the next two sections of this appendix.\nThe HSD group gave a total 162 presentations (talks and posters) at a total of 65 different\nscience meetings spread all across the US and around the World. The bulk of the HSD\npresentations were given at the AGU Fall, AGU/SPD Spring, EGU, and Space Weather\nWorkshop meetings.\nThese figures may include some publications from before October 2007 but probably\noverall represent a considerable underestimate of the body of work published and\npresented by the HSD group at GSFC.\n\nJournal Articles\nAbdo, A.A., B.

It is built up from material\t\nreleased from the stars of the Milky\nWay galaxy through stellar winds,\nnovas, and supernovas. The interstellar\nmedium has considerable structure, as\nillustrated here. IBEX images reveal\nglobal properties of the interstellar\nboundaries that separate the heliosphere from the local interstellar medium. The Voyager\nin sitar measurements are known at one specific location and time. Although Voyager 1\nhas recorded the first measurement of the termination shock and heliosheath properties,\nsingle-point measurements do not give a global understanding of the system. Because\nIBEX provides global maps of the interstellar interaction, IBEX observations are highly\ncomplementary to, and synergistic with, the detailed single-direction measurements\nprovided by the Voyager satellites.\nScientific Goals: IBEX\'s sole science objective is to discover the global interaction\nbetween the solar wind and the interstellar medium. IBEX achieves this objective by\ntaking a set of global energetic neutral atom (ENA) images that answer four fundamental\nscience questions:\no What is the global strength and structure of the termination shock?\no How are energetic protons accelerated at the termination shock?\no What are the global properties of the solar wind flow beyond the termination shock\nand in the heliotail?\no How does the interstellar flow interact with the heliosphere beyond the heliopause?\nStatus: IBEX was launched successfully on 2008 October 19\n\n146\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nCommunications/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (CINOFS)\nBackground:\nThe C/NOFS mission includes a satellite designed to\ninvestigate and forecast scintillations in Earth\'s ionosphere.\nIt was launched on a Pegasus-XL rocket on 2008 April 17\ninto a low-Earth orbit with an orbital inclination of 13\xc2\xb0, a\nperigee of 400 km, and an apogee of 850 km. The satellite,\nwhich is operated by the USAF Space Test Program, will\nallow the US military to predict the effects of ionospheric\nactivity on signals from communication and navigation\nsatellites, outages of which could potentially cause\nproblems in battlefield situations.\nC/NOFS includes comprehensive measurements of vector\nDC and wave electric fields, magnetic fields, plasma\ndensity and temperature, ion drifts, neutral winds, lightning\ndetector counts, as well as GPS scintillation and radio The C/NOFS Spacecraft\nbeacon experiments. Combined with a strong modeling and\nground-based observing component, this mission promises to demonstrably advance\nscientific understanding of Equatorial Spread F (ESF) irregularities and their conditions\nfor growth.\nCINDI Instrument on C/NOFS:\nThe Coupled Ion Neutral Dynamic Investigation (CINDI) is a Mission of Opportunity\ninvestigation on C/NOFS sponsored by NASA and designed and built by the University\nof Texas at Dallas. CINDI involves two instruments on the C/NOFS satellite that measure\nthe concentration and kinetic energy of the ions and neutral particles in space as the\nsatellite passes through them. This information will be used in building models to\nunderstand the various structures in the ionosphere, such as plasma depletions and\nassociated turbulence in the nightside, low-latitude ionosphere. These structures can\ninterfere with radio signals between Earth and spacecraft in orbit, thus causing errors in\ntracking and loss of communication.\nGSFC Role on C/NOFS:\nHSD built the Vector Electric Field Instrument (VEFI) for C/NOFS, which consists\nprimarily of an electric field detector that utilizes three orthogonal 20-m tip-to-tip doubleprobe antennas. VEFI measures direct current (DC) electric fields, which cause the bulk\nplasma motion that drives the ionospheric plasma to be unstable. Additionally, it\nmeasures the quasi-DC electric fields within the plasma density depletions to reveal the\nmotions of the depletions relative to the background ionosphere. VEFI also measures the\nvector AC electric field, which characterizes the ionospheric disturbances associated with\nspread-F irregularities. A fluxgate magnetometer, optical lightning detector, and a fixedbias Langmuir probe are also included in the VEFI instrument package. HSD also\nmanages the MO&DA funding for CINDI, and provides Project Scientist support.\n\n147\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nSignificant Milestones in FY08:\nThe C/NOFS mission was successfully launched in 2008. The instruments have been\ncommissioned and are returning excellent data. Among the many initial results revealed\nby C/NOFS instruments is the fact that the nightside, low-latitude ionosphere is highly\nstructured even during solar minimum and that the majority of spread-F depletions\nobserved thus far occur post-midnight.\n\nC/NOFS Orbit 756 -- June 06, 2008 (Day 158)\nVER and PLP Observations\n150\ntoo\n\nMend (Out)\n\nM\n\n50\nE\t\n\nL--.

It has\nobserved two Northern Hemisphere\nseasons and one Southern Hemisphere\nseason already.\nScientific Goals: AIM is the first satellite\nmission that probes on a global scale with\nhigh spatial resolution, the basic physics of\npolar mesospheric clouds (PMCs), also\nknown as noctilucent clouds, and makes\nNoctilucent clouds\t\nthat\t\ncan\t\nprovide\nmeasurements\t\ninformation on how these clouds form and vary. AIM addresses the following questions:\no Are there temporal variations in PMCs that can be explained by changes in solar\nirradiance and particle input?\no What changes in mesospheric properties are responsible for north/south differences in\nPMC features?\nWhat controls interannual variability in PMC season duration and latitudinal extent?\nWhat is the mechanism of teleconnection between winter temperatures and summer\nhemisphere PMC\'s?\no What is the global occurrence rate of gravity waves outside the PMC domain?\nDespite a significant increase in PMCs research in\nrecent years, relatively little is known about the\nbasic physics of these clouds at "the edge of space"\nand why they are changing. They have increased in\nbrightness over time, are being seen more often, and\nappear to be occurring at lower latitudes than ever\nbefore. It has been suggested (and debated) that\nthese changes are linked to global climate change.\nGSFC Role:\nHans Mayr was the Project Scientist of the AIM\nmission and has been involved in the scientific\nanalysis.\n\nThe Cloud Imaging and Particle Size\n(CIPS) Experiment shows that clouds\nare highly variable from orbit to orbit\nof and day to day.

Each spacecraft used close flybys of the\nMoon to escape into orbits about the Sun near 1 AU; one\nspacecraft (A) now leads Earth, while the other (B) trails. As\nviewed from the Sun, the two spacecraft separate at\napproximately 44-45 degrees per year.

The\nHSD manages the mission, through the Project Scientist\'s office and the STEREO\nScience Center. The Science Center is the focal point for STEREO science coordination\nas well as for E/PO; it processes the space weather beacon data, archives the STEREO\ntelemetry, mission support data, higher-level instrument data, and analysis software. HSD\nscience team members provide software for SECCHI and engage in science analysis.\nSignificant Project Milestones in FY08:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Considerable progress was made in merging images of CMEs from the two spacecraft\nwith modeling efforts to produce 3-D time-dependent scenarios of CME propagation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High-time-resolution observations of EUV waves from the two vantagepoints have\nbrought into question some of the conventional ideas about the cause of these waves.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Co-rotating interaction regions have been tracked from the Sun out to at least 1 AU.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In addition to solar results, STEREO has provided many new observations of comets,\nshowing comet tails being disrupted, and sometimes disconnected, by CMEs.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The nearly continuous wide-angle imagery from the Heliospheric Imager telescopes\nis being used to look for new asteroids, new variable stars, star quakes, and even\nextrasolar planets.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The radio and plasma wave instruments have been able to detect large quantities of\nimpacts against the spacecraft by nanometer-sized particles flowing out from the\nvicinity of the Sun at near-solar-wind speeds.\n\n151\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nHinode\nBackground:\nHinode (Japanese for "Sunrise"), formerly\nknown as Solar-B, is a mission of the Japan\nAerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) \t\nwith US, UK, ESA, and Norwegian\ncollaboration.

The satellite\t\nmaneuvered to the quasi-circular Sun-\n\n;^\n\nr,\n\nsynchronous orbit over the day/night\n\ntenninator, which allows near-continuous\nobservation of the Sun. Hinode is planned as a 3-year mission to explore the magnetic\nfields of the Sun. It consists of a coordinated set of optical, extreme ultraviolet (EUV),\nand X-ray instruments (the Solar Optical Telescope, the EUV Imaging Spectrometer, and\nthe X-ray Telescope) to investigate the interaction between the Sun\'s magnetic field and\nits corona. Each of the instruments has the highest angular resolution ever achieved in a\nsolar instrument for its spectral band.\nScientific Goals:\nHinode investigates the interaction between the Sun\'s magnetic field and the corona. The\nresult will be an improved understanding of the mechanisms that power the solar\natmosphere and drive solar eruptions. This information will tell how the Sun generates\nmagnetic disturbances and high-energy\nparticle storms that propagate from the\nSun to Earth and beyond; in this sense,\nHinode will help scientists predict spacePMIM\nweather.

It\nwas launched by a Pegasus rocket on 1998 April 1\ninto a Sun-synchronous orbit to get near-continuous\nobservations of the Sun. With TRACE, these\ntemperature domains can be observed nearly\nsimultaneously and at high spatial resolution. TRACE\noperations will be terminated following\nintercalibration with the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) instrument on the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO). SDO is currently manifested for\nlaunch in October 2009.\nScientific Goals: To simultaneously\ncapture high spatial and temporal\nresolution images of the transition\nregion. The TRACE data will provide\nquantitative observational constraints on\nthe models and thus stimulate real\nadvances in understanding the transition\nregion. The data also allow scientists to\nfollow the evolution of magnetic field\nstructures from the solar interior to the\ncorona, investigate the mechanisms of\nthe heating of the outer solar atmosphere,\nand investigate the triggers and onset of\nsolar flares and mass ejections.\n\nA neiv-cycle active region (NOAA\nAR11005) observed by TRACE on\n2008 October 14, in Fe X111951\n\nTRACE identified one possible source of the\nmagnetic stress that causes flares: sunspots that\nrotate, storing energy in the magnetic field.\n\nGSFC Role: GSFC provides mission management (mission scientist and resource\nanalyst), mission operations, scientific operations, and mirrored archive/data access\nfacilities for the TRACE Small Explorer (SMEX) mission.

One in the series of\nNASA\'s Small Explorer (SMEX) spacecraft, FAST\nwas designed to observe and measure the plasma\nphysics of the auroral phenomena which occur\naround both poles of the Earth. It is operated by the\nUniversity of California Berkeley\'s Space Sciences\nLaboratory.\nScientific Goals: Explore the detailed physical\nprocesses that accelerate particles and create the\nvisible aurora. Extended mission studies include\nglobal aspects of magnetosphere-ionosphere\ncoupling.\n\nFAST Spacecraft\n\nFAST observations provide new understanding of the development and structure of\nmagnetic storms and the ionospheric outflows that provide the plasma that feeds these\nstorms. FAST is the only satellite providing high-time-resolution field and particle\nmeasurements at the focus of the magnetic field lines mapping to the magnetopause,\ncusp, ring current, radiation belts, and magnetotail reconnection region. FAST is the only\nsatellite monitoring ionospheric outflows, a major source of the magnetospheric plasma.\nGSFC Role: HSD supplied the project scientist.\nSignificant Project Milestones in FY08: The FAST mission is now making key\ncontributions to THEMIS and its ground-based observatories\' prime mission science and,\n. 2009, will be in a near-ideal orbit to\nsupport Cluster\'s northern auroral-zone\npasses, within 2000 km of Cluster\'s\nperigee.

This joint\nNASA\xe2\x80\x94ESA mission has provided a wealth of\ndata from magnetic field, plasma, energetic\nparticle, dust, radio, and solar corona radio\noccultation measurements over three solar\norbits. The mission is now nearing the end of\noperations.\nScientilic Goals: Uriginal Ulysses mission\t\nUlysses explores the heliosphere.\nscience objectives were to investigate, as a\nfunction of heliographic latitude, the properties of the solar wind, the structure of the\nSun/wind interface, the heliospheric magnetic field, solar radio bursts and plasma waves,\nsolar X-rays, solar and galactic cosmic rays, and both interstellar and interplanetary\nneutral gas and dust. Additional objectives include the study of the Jovian magnetosphere\nduring the Jupiter flyby, the detection of cosmic y-ray bursts and triangulation on burst\nlocations with other detectors, and the search for gravitational waves. New objectives\nhave been evolving since launch. These entail combining Ulysses in situ measurements\nof solar-wind fields and particles, cosmic rays, and radio waves over a wide range of\nheliolatitudes and radial distances with remote observations of the Sun and solar corona\nfrom ongoing and upcoming missions. This is being done to analyze properties and\ndynamics of coronal mass ejections and of sources of the solar wind in order to enhance\nthe ability of those missions to meet their own science objectives and to construct models\nof the 3-1) Sun and heliosphere.\nGSFC Role: The HSD Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF) has been the primary NASA\ndistribution point for Ulysses data. HSD members have long participated in science\nworking team meetings for Ulysses and have been in regular contact with Ulysses\nscientists to define the requirements for, and support the delivery of, experiment and\nancillary data products. SPDF supports public access to Ulysses data through highly used\ndata systems such as the Coordinated Data Analysis Web (CDAWeb), the Coordinated\nHeliospheric Observations Web (COHOWeb), ftp browsing and downloads, and the\nHelioWeb service providing spacecraft position data in heliocentric coordinates. After\nmany years of less frequently updating SPDF holdings through more occasional contacts\nwith the data providers, SPDF now automatically ingests data updates on a daily basis.\nSPDF also works closely with the new Virtual Energetic Particle Observatory (VEPO) on\nvirtual observatory support for energetic-particle data products from three instrument\nsuites on Ulysses. The VEPO project is managed by the Chief Scientist for SPDF.\nFinally, SPDF works with the National Space Science Data Center in the Solar System\nExploration Division on delivery and registration of Ulysses data for permanent\narchiving.

Major\nmysteries remain unresolved, such as the source of, and acceleration mechanism for, the\nanomalous cosmic rays. The Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM), in combination with\nIBEX, should be able to solve some of these questions. The nature of the solar wind\nturbulence and the behavior of major solar wind structures downstream of the termination\nshock will also be examined by the VIM.\nGSFC Role: GSFC\'s principal contribution is through the Magnetometer (MAG)\ninstrument.\nSignificant Project Milestones in FY08: The two Voyager spacecraft have been heading\nout of the solar system for over 30 years. Voyager 2 crossed the termination shock last\nyear at about 8 billion miles from the Sun. An unexpected finding was that the\ntennination shock was re-forming on a time scale of a few hours as Voyager 2 crossed\nthe shock at least five times within three days. The detailed stricture of the magnetic field\nand plasma of the fully developed shock was observed on one crossing. The solar wind\nspeed in the heliosheath behind the shock was still supersonic with respect to the shocked\nsolar wind, which was cooler and faster moving than anticipated. The scales of the\nmagnetic field fluctuations are consistent with the hypothesis that ions derived from the\ninterstellar neutral gas dominate the temperature of the heliosheath.\n\n167\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nAPPENDIX 4: FUTURE MISSIONS\n\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)\nBackground: SDO is the first Living With a Star (LWS)\nmission.

It\nhas not been possible to replicate the\ntypical conditions in the laboratory, nor\nto diagnose the physical processes that\ncontrol\t the\t release\t\nof energy,\nparticularly at the small spatial scales\nwhere\t\nelectrons\t\nbecome\nthe\t\nunmagnetized.\n\nMagnetic reconnection at the magnetospheric boundary\n\nScientific Goals: Observations of reconnection require the three-dimensional\ndetermination of the magnetic field and plasma in the vicinity of the site of particle\nenergization. Thus, the overall goal of the MMS mission is to understand the\nmicrophysics of magnetic reconnection by determining the kinetic processes responsible\nfor the initiation and evolution of magnetic reconnection. More specifically, MMS will\ndetermine the role played by electron inertial effects and turbulent dissipation in driving\nmagnetic reconnection. MMS will also determine the rate of magnetic reconnection and\nthe parameters that control it.\nGSFC Role: MMS is a major GSFC\nproduct and involves many resources in\nHSD. Overall, the project is managed at\nGSFC and the four spacecraft will be built\ni\nat GSFC. The Project Scientist, Melvyn\t\nGoldstein, and the two Deputy Project\nScientists, Mark Adrian and Guan Le, are\nall members of HSD, as is the Lead\nInvestigator for the Fast Plasma Instrument\n(FPI), Tom Moore. In addition, the Dual\nElectron Sensors will be built and tested at MMS mission concept\nGSFC; the Japanese Dual Ion Sensors are\nthe responsibility of HSD, and HSD scientists are members of the Fields and the Theory\nand Modeling team.\nStatus: The primary goal of MMS in FY08 was to obtain permission to proceed to Phase\nC/D and to start building hardware. That process will involve many reviews of\ninstruments and of the project during 2009. Locally, as part of that process, a major\nrenovation and expansion of the HSD laboratory facilities is now under way and the Fast\nPlasma Instrument team is preparing for the reviews, which begin in December 2008.\n\n170\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nSolar Orbiter\nBackground: The Sun\'s atmosphere and the heliosphere are unique regions of space,\nwhere fundamental physical processes common to solar, astrophysical, and laboratory\nplasmas can be studied in detail and under conditions impossible to reproduce on Earth.\nThe results from SOHO and Ulysses have enormously advanced scientific understanding\nof the solar corona, the associated solar wind, and the 3-D heliosphere. However, the\npoint has been reached where in situ measurements much closer into the Sun, combined\nwith high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy at high latitudes, promise to bring about\nmajor breakthroughs.\nScientific Goals: The broad science\nobjective is to gain a better understanding\nof solar activity and variability. In\npractice, it means extending scientific\nknowledge of the solar interior to higher\nlatitudes and greater depths, beyond what\nSDO can achieve. Studying the nearsurface layers at high latitudes is a prime\nobjective. Probing the deep interior with\nsufficient accuracy may, however, require\nlonger observation durations than will be\npossible. In addition, demonstrating the\nconcept of stereoscopic helioseismology is\nan important objective. SDO and/or ground-based facilities, together with Solar Orbiter\nwould make a most powerful combination.\nGSFC Role: GSFC will host the US Solar Orbiter Project Office following any selection\nof instruments for that payload, which has not been formally selected as of this writing.\nStatus: The Solar Orbiter mission was approved in October 2000 by ESA\'s Science\nProgramme Committee as a flexi-mission for launch in the 2008-2013 time frame.\n\n171\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nSolar Probe Plus\nBackground: Solar Probe Plus (SP+) is humanity\'s first visit to the Sun to explore the\ncomplex and time-varying interplay of the Sun and Earth, which affects human activity.\nSP+ will determine where and what physical processes heat the corona and accelerate the\nsolar wind to its supersonic velocity. A combined remote-sensing and in situ sampling\nfrom within the solar corona itself will provide a "ground truth" never before available\nfrom astronomical measurements made from spacecraft in Earth\'s orbit or LaGrange\npoints. SP+ is currently under study as part of NASA\'s SMD.\nThe baseline mission provides for 24 perihelion passes inside 0.16 AU (35 Rs), with 19\npasses occurring within 20 Rs of the Sun. The first near-Sun pass occurs 3 months after\nlaunch, at a heliocentric distance\nof 35 Rs. Over the next several\nyears, successive Venus gravity\nassist (VGA) maneuvers\ngradually lower the perihelia to\n\xe2\x80\x949.5 Rs\xe2\x80\x94by far the closest any\nspacecraft has ever come to the\nSun. The spacecraft completes its\nnominal mission with three\npasses, separated by 88 days, at\nthis distance.\nScientific Goals: Although the\nSP+ science objectives remain\nthe same as those established for\nSolar Probe 2005, the new mission design differs dramatically from the 2005 design (as\nwell as from all previous Solar Probe mission designs since the 1970s). The 2005, and\nearlier, missions involved one or two flybys of the Sun at a perihelion distance of 4 Rs by\na spacecraft placed into a solar polar orbit by means of a Jupiter gravity assist. In\ncontrast, SP+ remains nearly in the ecliptic plane and makes many near-Sun passes at\nincreasingly lower perihelia.\nSolar ivind speed as measured by Ulysses.\t\n\nGSFC Role: GSFC will provide a mission scientist and will participate in instrument\nproposals.\nStatus: A NASA Announcement of Opportunity soliciting instrument proposals is\nexpected in early 2009.\n\n172\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nSentinels\nBackground: The Solar Sentinels mission is the heliospheric portion of the global Living\nWith a Star (LWS) program connecting the solar and geospace observations made by the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Radiation Belts Storm Probes (RBSP).\nSentinels consists of four identical spinning spacecraft launched into slightly different\n0.25 x 0.76 AU near-ecliptic inner heliospheric orbits. The focus of the Sentinels mission\nis to make multi-point in situ observations of the solar wind and the energetic-particle\nenvironment.\nSentinels is also the NASA component of the\njoint NASA\xe2\x80\x94ESA Heliophysical Explorers\n(HELEX) mission, which also includes ESA\'s\nSolar Orbiter mission. Solar Orbiter will focus\non out-of-ecliptic and remote-sensing\nobservations of the Sun. The comprehensive\ninner heliospheric observations will be\ncompleted by the upper coronal (10 Rs) in siti.t\nmeasurements to be provided by the SP+\nmission.\nSentinels will require an Atlas V-class launch\nvehicle and will use multiple Venus gravity Artist concept of the Sentinels mission\nassist maneuvers to attain their orbits. \t\nfrom the Sentinels Science and Technology\nDefinition Team (STDT) Report (Courtesy\n\nScientific Goals: Sentinels has three primary ofJ. Rumburg).\nscience goals:\n1. What are the origins of the solar wind streams and the heliospheric magnetic field?\na. How and where do fast and slow solar wind streams originate?\nb. What are the solar sources of the heliospheric magnetic field?\nc. What is the solar origin of turbulence and structures at all scales in the solar\nwind?\n2. What are the sources, acceleration mechanisms, and transport processes of solar\nenergetic particles?\na. What are the sources of energetic particles and how are they accelerated to high\nenergy?\nb. How are solar energetic particles released from their sources and distributed in\nspace and time?\n3. How do CMEs evolve in the inner heliosphere?\na. How is the structure of interplanetary CMEs related to their origin`.\nb. How do transients add magnetic flux to, and remove it from, the heliosphere?\nc. How and when do shocks form near the Sun?\nGSFC Role: Adam Szabo (GSFGHSD) is the Study Scientist.\nStatus: Current plans call for a launch date no earlier than 2017.\n\n173\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nSolar C\nBackground: Following the success of Yohkoh (Solar A) and Hinode (Solar B), JAXA\nis considering developing a new solar mission. Currently, there are two scientific thrusts\nunder consideration.\nScientific Goals: Depending on which concept is finally decided upon, the scientific\ngoals are either:\no The global versus the local dynamo\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Measure meridional flow at high latitudes, and see where it turns downwards\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Detect the magneto-sound speed anomaly located in the tachocline region\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Observe the vector magnetic fields of the photosphere and chromosphere and\nobtain coronal imaging in X-ray/EUV wavelengths\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Obtain acoustic speed and angular rotation speed distributions in the polar\nregion\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Understand the acceleration mechanism of the fast solar wind\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Monitor total irradiance (optional)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Study the influence of the Sun on the heliosphere\nOr,\no Coronal and chromospheric heating\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Obtain precise chromospheric and, if possible, coronal vector magnetic field\nmaps in addition to photospheric magnetic maps with high spatial and\ntemporal resolution\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Obtain coronal 3-D magnetic-field map from chromospheric vector field,\npredict location and evolution of neutral sheets, discontinuities for transient\nand stationary coronal heating and eruption\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reveal causal relationship of photosphere-chromosphere-transition regioncorona to understand coronal/chromospheric heating and dynamics\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Understand the nature of hidden magnetism: Is the observed magnetic field\nthe tip of the iceberg?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Deepen Hinode discoveries with quantitative analysis: waves, turbulence,\nmagnetic reconnection\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Study the influence of the Sun on the heliosphere\nGSFC Role: TBD\nStatus: The concept is being developed by a Solar-C Scientific Working Group. NASA\nhas not committed to participating in the mission as yet.\n\n174\n\n\t\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nGeospace Electrodynamic Connections (GEC)\nBackground: The GEC mission is a multi-spacecraft Solar Terrestrial Probe (STP) that\nhas been specifically designed to advance to a new, and deeper level of physical insight,\nscientific understanding of the coupling among the ionosphere, thermosphere, and\nmagnetosphere. GEC is NASA\'s fifth STP. The ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system is\nnot merely a passive absorber of magnetospheric energy; it is an active participant in the\nenergy exchange process. GEC will, therefore, also investigate the role of the ionosphere\nand thermosphere in modulating the energy exchange with the magnetosphere and will\naddress a second fundamental question: How is the IT region dynamically coupled to the\nmagnetosphere?\nThe GEC spacecraft will all be\nParticle\nidentically instrumented to sample in\nsitu the ionized and neutral gases of the\nupper atmosphere and to measure the\nelectric and magnetic fields that couple\nthe IT system to the magnetosphere. The\nIon Dragi\nNeutral Winds\nfocus of the GEC mission will be on the\t\nj,\nTraveling \t\nJoule Heating\nZI\t\nlower reaches of the ionosphere and Disturbances\t\nthermosphere, where the neutral Ionospheric\t\nGEC\nConstellation\natmosphere plays a preeminent role in\nprocessing\t\nand\t\ndissipating\t\nthe\nelectromagnetic energy received from\nthe magnetosphere. The GEC spacecraft\nwill use onboard propulsion to perform many excursions to altitudes below the nominal\nperigee of 185 km, sampling a significant portion of the Hall and Pedersen conductivity\nlayer where significant closure of field-aligned currents and associated Joule heating\nbegin to occur. During these low-perigee excursions, and at certain other times as well,\nGEC in situ measurements will be coordinated with ground-based observatories. Such\ncoordinated campaigns are an integral part of the GEC mission concept.\nScientific Goals: Through multipoint measurements in the IT system, GEC will do the\nfollowing:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Discover the spatial and temporal scales on which magnetospheric energy input into the\nIT region occurs\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determine the spatial and temporal scales for the response of the IT system to this input\nof energy\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Quantify the altitude dependence of the response. GEC will thereby answer the\nfundamental question: How does the IT system respond to magnetospheric forcing?\nGSFC Role: TBD\nStatus: Because of recent budget cuts impacting the STP Program, the GEC mission is\nmoved outside the near-term (5-year) budget planning window. Status updates associated\nwith recent roadmap activities are currently under way; however, beyond roadmap\nactivity updates, minimal updates are planned for GEC.\n175\n\n\t\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nMagnetospheric Constellation (MagCon)\nBackground: MagCon is a constellation of 50 small satellites distributed in 3 x 7 R E to\n3 x 40 RE, low-inclination, nested orbits, with "nearest-neighbor" average spacing 1.02.0 RE between satellites, in the domain of the near-Earth plasma sheet.\nScientific Goals: MagCon will answer the fundamental question:\no How does the dynamic magnetotail store, transport, and release matter and energy?\nGSFC Role: Build on ST5 technology development\nkk\n\nis\t\n4\t\n\n>t,\nI\n\n^\n\na\t\n\n4\t\n+"\'\'s^\t\n\n176\n\nStatus: Future funding for\nthe MagCon mission is\nhighly uncertain and has\ntentatively been deferred\nbeyond FY09 by the\nPresident\'s FY05 budget\nproposal. NASA HQ,\nhowever, has requested a\nwhite paper summarizing\n\nthe status of this mission\nand\t\nthe\t\ndevelopment\noptions for future work, in\nthe event that funding\nbecomes available.\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nInterstellar Probe\nBackground: Interstellar Probe will include a comprehensive suite of sensors designed\nto measure the detailed properties of the plasma, neutral atoms, energetic particles,\nmagnetic fields, cosmic rays, and dust at the heliospheric boundaries and in the nearby\ninterstellar medium. It will explore the "wall" of neutral interstellar hydrogen that lies just\nbeyond the heliopause and determine the large-scale structure of the heliosphere by\nimaging energetic neutral atoms created in dynamic processes occurring just beyond the\ntermination shock. In addition, Interstellar Probe will map the infrared emission in the\nouter solar system to determine the distribution of interplanetary dust and reveal the\ncosmic infrared background radiation.\nThis great journey requires advanced\npropulsion, and the 200-kg Interstellar Probe is\ndesigned to use a 200-m-radius solar sail to\nachieve a velocity of 14 AU/yr. After exiting\nthe heliosphere within a decade of launch, it\nwill be capable of continuing to --400 AU.\nInterstellar Probe will serve as the first step in a\nmore ambitious program to explore the outer\nsolar system and nearby galactic neighborhood.\n\npl^\n\nScientific Goals:\no Explore the nature of the interstellar medium and its implications for the origin and\nevolution of matter in the galaxy and the universe\no Explore the influence of the interstellar medium on the solar system, its dynamics,\nand its evolution\no Explore the impact of the solar system on the interstellar medium as an example of\nthe interaction of a stellar system with its environment\no Explore the outer solar system in search of clues to its origin, and to the nature of\nother planetary systems\n\nGSFC Role: TBD\nStatus: Conceptual development\n\n177\n\nGSFC Heliophysics Science Division 2008 Science Highlights\n\nStellar Imager (SI)\nBackground: SI is a UV/optical deep-space telescope to image stars like the Sun with\n0.1 milli-aresec resolution, to help understand the solar dynamo, the internal structure and\ndynamics of magnetically active stars, how magnetic activity drives space weather on\ntimescales of years to billions of years, and how magnetic activity affects planetary\nclimates and habitability.\nScientific Goals:\nDevelop and test a predictive\ndynamo model for the Sun by:\n0 Observing the patterns in\nsurface magnetic activity for a\nlarge sample of Sun-like stars\n(with 1000 resolution\nelements on surfaces of nearby\nstars)\no Imaging the structure and\ndifferential rotation of stellar\ninteriors via a stero seismology with over 30 resolution elements on stellar disks\no Carrying out a population study of Sun-like stars to determine the dependence of\ndynamo action on mass, internal stricture, flow patterns, and time. This will enable\ntesting of dynamo models over a few years of observations of many stars, instead of\nover many decades using only the Sun.\nGSFC Role: TBD\nStatus: Conceptual
