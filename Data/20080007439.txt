The components are held by\nan electrically insulating body having a central axis, a top\naxial end, and a bottom axial end. The cusped magnetic field\nis formed by a cylindrical magnet having an axis of rotation\nthat is the same as the axis of rotation of the insulating body,\nand magnetized with opposite poles at its two axial ends; and\nan annular magnet coaxially surrounding the cylindrical\nmagnet, magnetized with opposite poles at its two axial ends\nsuch that a top axial end has a magnetic polarity that is\nopposite to the magnetic polarity of a top axial end of the\ncylindrical magnet. The ionizing gas source is a tubular\nplenum that has been curved into a substantially annular\nshape, positioned above the top axial end of the annular\nmagnet such that the plenum is centered in a ring-shaped\ncusp of the magnetic field generated by the magnets. The\nplenum has one or more capillary-like orifices spaced\naround its top such that an ionizing gas supplied through the\nplenum is sprayed through the one or more orifices. The\nplenum is electrically conductive and is positively charged\nrelative to the cathode electron source such that the plenum\nfunctions as the anode; and the cathode is positioned above\nand radially outward relative to the plenum.\n14 Claims, 4 Drawing Sheets\n\nU S .

Such a\nplasma source utilizing a magnetic cusp to generate a dense\nplasma over small length scales has been built and tested.\nThis approach could potentially mitigate the need for large\ncontainment volumes (size) in order to achieve reasonable\nionization efficiencies. The discharge plasma is both generated and accelerated via this approach using in principle\nonly a single Power Supply. Data SWgests that the invention\nshould be capable of generating between 0.5 and 1.0 mN\n(milli-Newton) of thrust. Applications envisioned include\nlow energy Plasma Processing in addition to ProPulsion for\nsatellite StatiOn-keePing,drag reduction and Primary ProPulsion for micro-satellites. The invention will be described in\nthe form of its Preferred embodiment as a compact Plasma\naccelerator.\nIn its preferred embodiment, the invention employs a\nmagnetic cusp to effectively utilize discharge electrons for\nionization purposes and at the same time to generate sufficiently high sheath potentials for accelerating ions outward\nto develop thrust. This approach utilizes a single electron\nsource that provides not only discharge electrons but also\nelectrons to neutralize the ion beam exiting the device.\nBecause this approach is gridless, it can develop higher\nthrust densities than a gridded ion source of similar dimensions. Additionally, because the device operates on inert\ngases, the plume is non-contaminating to space craft surfaces. This point is to be contrasted with other options such\nas PPT (pulsed plasma thruster) and FEEP (field enhanced\nelectric propulsion) systems which generate contaminating\nand often toxic plumes.\nA preferred embodiment of the inventive accelerator is\nillustrated in several views in FIGS. 1-3, FIG. 1 being a\ncross-sectional side view with the cross-section taken along\nthe line 1-1 as indicated in the top view of FIG. 2. FIG. 3\nis a bottom view wherein a bottom plate has been removed\nto allow a view of internal elements. For convenience in this\ndescription, the terms \xe2\x80\x9ctop\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbottom\xe2\x80\x9d will be used to\nindicate directions as they are illustrated in the side view of\nFIG. 1. Of course these directions are not intended to be\nlimiting, but rather are used to indicate relative positioning\nof various components. As is known in the relevant arts,\nplasma accelerators will function in any orientation relative\nto a gravitational field.\nWith reference to FIGS. 1-3, the preferred embodiment of\nthe invention is a compact plasma accelerator (thruster) 10\nhaving major components that include a cathode electron\nsource, an anode, an ionizing gas source (also referred to as\na source of ionized gas), and a magnetic field source. The\ncomponents are held by a disc-shaped electrically insulating\nbody 12, preferably made of ceramic, e.g., a machinable\nceramic such as MacorTM.\nThe top of the body 12 has a\nmatching circular cover plate 14, also electrically insulating\nand preferably made of ceramic, e.g., MacorTM, in place\nheld\nby screws 16 that are recessed into the cover plate 14 enough\nto be at least flush with the top surface of the cover plate 14.\nA minimum number of screws 16 are utilized, for example\nfour screws 16 spaced evenly around the perimeter of the\ncover plate 14 may be adequate to secure the cover plate 14\non top of the body 12. The screws 16 are made of a\nnonmagnetic material (e.g., stainless steel), and threaded\nholes 32 can be provided in the body 12 by known means.\nThe bottom of the body 12 has a matching circular backing\nplate 18 made of a ferromagnetic material (e.g., mild steel)\n\nheld in place by screws 26 that are recessed into the backing\nplate 18 enough to be at least flush with the bottom surface\nof the backing plate 18. Aminimum number of screws 26 are\nutilized, for example four screws 26 spaced evenly around\nthe perimeter of the backing plate 18 may be adequate to\nsecure the backing plate 18 onto the body 12. The screws 26\nare made of a nonmagnetic material (e.g., stainless steel),\nand threaded holes 28 can be provided in the body 12 by\nknown means.\nThe body 12 has an annular stepped-down portion 30\nsurrounding the periphery of the top of the body 12,\nMounted on the stepped-down portion 30 are at least two\nstandoffs 21 for holding cathodes 48a, 48b (collectively\nreferred to as 48), the standoffs 21 comprisingbolts 20,\nmade of a nonmagnetic material, passing through insulating\n(e.g., ceramic) standoff sleeves 22, and screwed into\nthreaded holes 24 provided in the stepped-down portion 30\nof the body 12. In the preferred embodiment, the cathode 48\nis a hot filament cathode (e.g., double-braided tantalum wire\ncoated with barium carbonate, R-500 compound) that is\nsupported by the standoffs 21 and circumnavigates the cover\nplate 14 in two portions 48a, 48b that are collectively\nreferred to as cathode 48. The circumnavigating cathode 48\nis positioned above and radially outward relative to holes 46\nthat are spaced around the cover plate 14, and more fully\ndescribed hereinbelow. As illustrated in FIG. 2 for the\npreferred embodiment, the inner diameter of the circumnavigating cathode 48 is located along the edge of the circle\ndefined by the radially outermost edges of the holes 46.\nCurrent for the hot filament cathode 48 is provided by a\npower supply 54 that, for example, passes current through\nsupply wire 52a, through cathode wires 48a, 48b, and back\nto the power supply 54 through supply wire 52b. The supply\nwires 52a, 52b are covered with insulating sleeves 50 (e.g.,\nwoven fiberglass sleeves). A discharge power supply 57\nprovides power to a plenum supply line 43 through a supply\nwire 52c. The current for the discharge plenum supply line\npasses from the discharge power supply 57 through supply\nwire 52c, and charges the plenum anode positively. Then, the\nelectrons leave the negative end of the discharge power\nsupply 57 and enter the vacuum. The electrons collect at the\nanode and return to the discharge power supply 57 through\nwire 52c. The supply wires 52a, 52b, 52c, 52d are covered\nwith insulating sleeves 50 (e.g., woven fiberglass sleeves).\nAlternatively, other electron sources could be utilized for the\ncathodes 48 such as, for example, one or more hollow\ncathodes or field emission type cathodes, however hot\nfilament cathodes 48 are preferred because, among other\nreasons, they function with a single simple power supply,\nand do not require a gas supply and are less sensitive to\npoisoning issues.\nThe magnetic field source comprises two magnets, preferably permanent to avoid the complication of added power\nsupplies needed to power electromagnets. A cylindrical\nmagnet 34 is mounted in a matching recess 35 of the body\n12 such that the axis of rotation AR of the cylindrical magnet\n34 is the same as the axis of rotation AR of the insulating\nbody 12. The cylindrical magnet 34 is magnetized with\nopposite poles at its two axial ends. An annular magnet 36\ncoaxially surrounds the cylindrical magnet 34, and is magnetized with opposite poles at its two axial ends such that a\ntop axial end has a magnetic polarity that is opposite to the\nmagnetic polarity of a top axial end of the cylindrical magnet\n34. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, the top axial end of the\ncylindrical magnet 34 is a \xe2\x80\x9cnorth\xe2\x80\x9d (N) pole and the bottom\naxial end of the cylindrical magnet 34 is a \xe2\x80\x9csouth\xe2\x80\x9d (S) pole;\nwhereas the top axial end of the annular magnet 36 is a\n\n5\n\n1s\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nso\n\nss\n\n60\n\n65\n\nUS 6,696,792 B1\n\n9\n\n10\n\n"south" (S) pole and the bottom axial end of the annular\nthe positioning being such that electrons emitted from the\nmagnet 36 is a "north" (N) pole.\ncathode 48 must undergo cross-magnetic-field 56 diffusion\nto reach the anodeiplenum 42 through the cover plate holes\nAmagnetic field 56 is indicated by magnetic field lines in\nFIG. 4.

Some of the test results are charted in FIGS.\n5-8.\nFIG. 5 is a plot of downstream ion beamlet current density\n(amps per square centimeter for a single beamlet emanating\nfrom one of the orifices 44) indicated on a logarithmic\nvertical axis 51 versus radial position in the beamlet indicated on a linear horizontal axis 52, measured in millimeters\nfrom the estimated center of the orifice 44b that created the\nbeamlet. Three curves 54, 56, 58 are shown to illustrate the\nresults at propellant flow rates of 0.48,0.60, and 0.75 SCCM\n(standard cubic centimeters per minute), respectively. An\nestimated radial position of the center of the orifice 44b is\nindicated by the line 53.It can be seen that the peak current\ndensity increases significantly as the flow rate is reduced.\nAlso, beam dispersion appears to reduce somewhat as the\nflow rate is reduced. The following table indicates ion beam\ncurrent parameter upper limits as estimated from test results.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cutilization\xe2\x80\x9d is an efficacy measurement representing\nthe ion current obtained per unit flow of propellant gas\nmolecules, i.e., utilization is a measure of the fraction of\ninput ionizing gas that is converted into ions in the ion beam.\n\nFlow Rate (SCCM)\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nFlow Rate\n(SCCM)\n\nIon Current-One\nOrifice (milliamps)\n\nIon Current-Four\nOrifices (milliamps)\n\n0.48\n0.60\n0.75\n\n7.5\n\n30.\n\n1.3\n0.6\n\n5.2\n2.4\n\nUtilization\n(equivalent\namps)\n\n0.88\n0.12\n0.05\n\n35\n\nThrust (mN)\n\nSpecific Impulse (s)\n\n0.48\n0.60\n\n0.44\n0.08\n\n990\n130\n\nIt can be seen that the compact plasma accelerator 10\nworks best at very low flow rates, probably because the\nionization efficiency goes down with increasing flow rate.\nFIG. 7 is a plot of discharge current (milliamps) indicated\non a vertical axis 71, versus cathode-to-anode voltage drop\n(volts), also known as discharge voltage, indicated on a\nhorizontal axis 72. Three curves 77, 78, 79 are shown to\nillustrate the results at propellant flow rates of 0.62, 0.75,\nand 1.5 SCCM, respectively.\nFIG. 8 is a plot of discharge voltage (volts) indicated on\na vertical axis 81, versus propellant flow rates (SCCM)\nindicated on a horizontal axis 82. One curve 85 is shown,\nmeasured under a condition of constant discharge current\n(Id), i.e., at each propellant flow rate. Differences between\ndischarge voltages indicated by the curves 77,78,79 of FIG.\n7, and the discharge voltages plotted in FIG. 8 are generally\nattributable to filament temperature for the cathode 48. Since\nthe data was collected in different test runs, the discharge\nvoltage may be slightly different depending on the filament\ntemperature. The main point of the plots in FIGS. 7 and 8 is\nto show that the discharge voltage is not very sensitive to\nchanges in discharge current. This is to say that the device\ncan operate at a wide range of discharge currents with the\ndischarge voltage varying only by a small amount. This\noperation is similar to hollow cathode plasma contactor\nclamping.\nFrom FIGS. 7 and 8 it can be seen that:\na) The discharge current increases more rapidly than\nlinear with increases in discharge voltage.\nb) The discharge voltage tended to saturate at a reduced\nflow rate.\nc) The discharge power ranged between about 20 and\nabout 40 watts.
