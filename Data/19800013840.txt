As experienced\nwith most hardware-oriented programs, difficulties and delays were\nexperienced with design iterations and fabrication schedules. However, the test program was accelerated, and the engine was shipped\non schedule.\nAn\n\nThe technical goals for the program are listed in table 1.\nPerformance goals represented a TSFC improvement of approximately\n9 percent over other turbofan engines. The noise goals were 10- to\n15-EPNdB below the Federal Aviation Administration\'s FAR Part 36\nrequirements. The emissions goals were identical to the EPA 1979\nstandards for T-1 class engines. (The EPA subsequently determined\nthat general aviation was not a significant source ot air polution\nand therefore did not impose these standards)\n\n.\n\naYGINE DESIGN\n\nT5e principal program objective was to demonstrate the application of large turbofan noise- and emissions-teduction techn~logy\nto small general (ririation turbofans.\nTo do this, a number of\nunique features were incorporated in the basic design of the QCGAT\nengine in order to reduce the emissions and noise levels below\nthose of the already quiet TFE731 engine. This work was initiated\nPhase I study. Twelve candidate engine\nin 1975 during the -AT\nconfigurations were screened.\nUany parameters were considered,\ni~clud :\ning\nPan pressure ratios at takeoff and cruise\nThrust\nTSFC\nLapse rate\nFan diameter\nInstalled weight\nNoise\nNacelle drag\nAcoustic shielding\nCost\n\n.\n\nThe engine cycle selected f o r the program represented a practical\nengine from the standpoints of cost, weight, airplane/crcelle\ninterference drag, and cruise propulsion efficiency.\nThe engine\nalso exhibited high potential for reduction of turbomachinery and\njet noise, and reduction of chemical and visible exhaust emissions.\nThe design point for the engine (typical for most modern business\njets) and principal engine cycle parameters are iisted in table 2.\nFigure 3 is a cross-section of the overall QCGAT engine\ndesign.

Location of the TFE731 aft turbine\nbearing was retained.\nThe unusual shape of the third-stage disk\n(fig. 12) was the result of this latter constraint. Since LP spool\nspeed is fixed ty the TFE731 LP compressor, the larger turbine\nrepresented a major design challenge from the standpoints of\nstress, vibration, blade flutter, life, and materials.\nIn addition, use of the 12-lobe compound mixer nozzle required low exit\nswirl angles. Total-to-total efficiency goal was set at 90 percent. As a result of these constraints, numerous compromises were\nnecessary during design. Although it is not feasible to include the\ndetailed results of all aerodynamic, thermodynamic, and mechanical\ndesign analyses in this report, all constraints were satisfied,\nincluding that of efficiency.\nIt was originally intended to use only a hydromechanical control system for the QCGAT engine.\nHowever, because the hydromechanical unit is considered a backup system on the TFE731, it was\ndecided to use a production TFE731 electronic control system as\nthe primary control.\nThe control (fig. 13) is a full-authority\nsystem providing speed control, over temperature, and overspeed\nprotection under all operating conditions.\nThese include start,\ntransient, and steady state. A comparison of QCGAT engine character istics and the TFE731-3 was made to determine if modifications\nwere necessary to the existing computer.\nThis comparison showed\nthat the basic logic was satisfactory, and the adjustment ranges\nwere adequate.\nThe QCGAT combustor (fig. 14) is a version of the TFE731\nburner in production at the initiation of the program.\nIn-house\nmodifications for the TFE731 engine, which consisted of holepattern variations for smoke reduction, were incorporated in the\n\nQCGAT e n g i n e .

Analysis of\nthis and other data showed that at maxinum sea level static thrust,\nthe fan was lower than predicted in efficiency and in airflow.\nThis characteristic is typical of most fans in this size class\nwherein compromises in aerodynamic configurations imposed by design\nfor bird strike cause unfavorable airfoil loadings with consequent\ndecrease in efficiency and airflow capacity.\nCOMPARISON TO AERODYNAMIC GOALS\nTable 8 is a comparison of the tested engine performance to\nthe QCGAT program goals. The largest difference occurred on the\nuninstalled engine where the fan performance, as well as a one\npercent lower than estimated thrust coefficient for the coannular\nnozzle, resulted in a specific fuel consumption slightly over the\nestimate.\nWhen the nacelle was inst- lled, including the mixer nozzle,\nthe sea level static TSFt is seen to be 1.4 percent over the goal.\nIn this case, a comparison of the engine tested performance versus\nthe analytical model showed that the mixer nozzle exceeded the\nestimate, while the fan performance was below the estimate.\nExtrapolation of the tested data to the altitude cruise condition shows that the cruise TSFC would be below the estimated level.\nSince the majority of the mission fuel is consumed at cruise, it is\nconcluded that the program fuel consumption goals were achieved and\nthat QCGAT has demonstrated a significant advancement in engine\ne~ficiency.\n\nEMISSIONS TEST\n\nWork on t h e combustion s y s t e m < ? s i g n o f t h e AiResearch QCGAT\n\ne n g i n e was conducted under s e p a r a t e contra:t\nf o r t h e T-1 combustor,\nHowevx, s c h e d u l e incompati n i t i a l l y selected f o r t h e program,\ni b i l i t i e s p r e v e n t e d d i r e c t i n c o r p o r a t i o n o f t h e T-1 combustor i n\nt h e program and a n i n t e r i m d e s i g n was used.\nThe combustor l i n e r used i n t h e QCGAT tests ( f i g . 8) was a\nm o d i f i c a t i o n o f t h e production TFE731 b u r n e r , These m C i f i c a t i o n s\nc o n s i s t e d c f sei era1 v a r i a t i o n s , and i n c l u d e d punched v e r s u s\npierced holes.\nD i f f e r e n t h o l e l o c a t i o n s and s i z e s were i n c o r p o r a t e d f o r smoke number r e d u c t i o n .\nThe a c t u a l b u r n e r used i n t h e\nt e s t was a n e x p e r i m e n t a l i n t e r i m d e s i g n , A s a r e s u l t , t h e ternserat u r e p a t t e r n f a c t o r was h i g h e r t h a n d e s i r e d d u r i n g e a r l y t e s t i n g .\nT h i s c o n d i t i o n was c o r r e c t e d on l a t e r b u r n e r s .\nC o n t r o l of t h e g a s e o u s e m i s s i o n s a t i d l e w a s accomplished by\ns u p p l y i n g a i r to t h e s e c o n d a r y a t o m i z e r s o f \' ae f u e l n o z z l e s .

These were the results\nof torch brazing the HP compressor discharge total-pressure probes\ninto the plenum after the part had conpleted the normal stressrelieving process, This is a problem that is unique to the highly\ninstrumented test engine and wouid not appear on production-type\nplenums,\nThe third problem noted was a crack in the surface of one HP\nturbine cooled stator wane (figure 14). This crack resulted from a\nsingle hot streak in the engine. This was the result of using the\nexperimental low-smoke zombustion liner that had not been sufficiently developed at the time this test was run. This characteristic was subsequently corrected, and later production low-smoke\ncombustor liners did not exhibit a hot streak.\nAll three of the problems found during teardown inspection\nwere determined to be the result of outside factors and not the\nresult of design deficiency.\nThe basic engine design fulfilled\ndesign requirements.

Acoustic: duct liner configurations were\ndesigned to balance the noise suppression at takeoff, sideline, and\napproach condition, providinq the broadest possible attenuation\nbandwidth without sacrificing sianificant attenuation from optimum\nat any one of the three operating conditions.\nThe major acoustic features of the QCGAT erlgine are illustrated in figure 2. Noise-reduction technology was applied to the\ntwo major noise sources, the fan and the jet. The fan noise-source\nreduction features included the following: elimination of inlet\nguide vanes, low tip speed and pressure ratio, single-stage fan, a\nlarge rotor to stator spacing of 2.12 rotor chords, and c. large\nnumber of bypass and core stators to cut-off rotor-stator intcraction tones. The jet noise-reduction features included low fan discharge and primary jet-exhaust velocities, and a 12-lobe mixer\ncompound exhaust nozzle\n\n.\n\nThe nacelle acoustic treatment design selected for the QCGAT\nengine consisted of a single-cavity system used in series with\ndifferent cavity depths in the axial direction and where possible\nequivalent depths on opposing walls.\nA broadband resonator was\nconstructed from aluminu~ perforated sheet bonded to a 0.95-cm\n(3/8-in.) all-aluminum honeycomb backing because of its structural\nruggedness, low cost, and known acoustic performance.\nschematic of the acoustic liner inst~L!ation is shown in\nfigure 3. The inlet-wall treatments--sections A1, A2, and B--were\ntuned to provide primary suppression at the FAR Part 36 sideline\ncondition with a length equal to 2.16-cm (0.85-in.) mea;! inlet\ndiameter. The fan discharge duct treatments--sections 1, 2, ari5\n3--were tuned to provide balanced attenuation between sideline and\napproach conditions, and have an t.f fective total length equal to 5.4\ntimes the average duct height.\nA\n\nF i n a l o p t i m i z a t i o n or\n\nt h e engine and n a c e l l e exhaust l i n e r\n\nd e s i g n w a s c o m p l e t e d u s i n g a c o m p u t e r p r o g r a m b a s e d upon t h e a x i s y m m e t r i c mode\n\nt h e o r y of M i n n e r\n\nand Rice\n\n(re. l\n\nTo a c h i e v e\n\noptimum a t t e n u a t i o n , t h e r e q u i r e d c a v i t y d e p t h s a n d f a c e s h e e t o p e n\na r e a s were computed.\nThe d e s i g n p r o c e d u r e f o r t h e i n l e t l i n e r s was b a s e d u p o n t h e\nr e c e n t m u l t j m o d a l d u c t t r e a t m e n t a n a l y s i s d e v e l o p e d a t NASA-Lewis\nT h e i n l e t l i n e r s were t u n e d t o a t t e n u -\n\nby R i c e ( r e f . 2 t h r o u g h 5 ) .\n\na t e modes t h a t r a d i a t e e n e r a y a t l a r g e r a n g l e s f r o m t h e i n l e t a x i s ,\nt h u ~r e d u c i n g s i d e l i n e n c i s e r a d i a t i o n ,\nThe major\n\nd e s i g n character is ti.^^ o f\n\nl i n e r s a r e shown i c t,?bie 1.\n\nthe\n\ni c l e t a n d oxhaust\n\nThc i n l e t s e c t i o n s A\n\nb a c k i n g d e p t h s o r 1 . 8 3 cm ( 0 . 7 2 i n . ! ,\n\nand B have\n\nA2,\n\n1\'\n2.8 c m (1.1 i n . ) ,\n\nand 1.35 c m\n\nt o 1 4 . 2 perc e n t .

The correlation of the approach corrected data was consistent\nwith that of the takeoff corrected data.\n\nAn example of the \'as measured\' spectra from each microphone\nis shown in figure 9. Large differences between the pole-mounted\nand ground microphones were observed from 200 to 4000 Hz.\nFigure 10 shows the same data with the excess attenuation corrections\napplied. Overall, good agreement was obtained for all microphones\nand all 1/3-octave band frequencies.\nAn example of the final result of applying the ground correction is shown in figure 11. The free-field levels were reduced in\nthe low frequency range, and the grourid dip in the 400- through\n500-Hz range was decreased, resulting in 2 7mooth spectral curve.\nLittle or no change occurred at the high 1 quencies.\nACOUSTIC COMPARISONS OF STATIC DATA\nThe corrected data for each acoustic configuration tested was\ncompared to establish trends and illustrate the level comparisons\nwith the equivalent Model TFL731-3 takeoff and approach static\ndata. A comparison between the hardwall coannular configuration-the loudest QCGAT configuration--with the Model TFE731-3 at takeoff\ncondition is shown in figure 12.\nThe QCGAT tone-corrected perceived noise levels (PNLT) are considerably lower than the Model\nTFE731-3 primarily because of the lower exhaust velocity, even\nthough the QCGAT engine produces 8-percent more thrust.

These predictions are adjusted by applying the appropriate correction spectra\ndetermined from the static data.\nThe adjusted m \' a sources are taken to flight conditions with\ncorrections for distance, atmospheric attenuation, jet relative\nvelocity and dynamic amplification effects, fan inlet cleanup, doppler effects, wing shielding, and ground effects.\nThe adjusted\nsources are \'flownm along a prescribed flight path using the\nGTENFLY pr og ram.\n\n--\n\ntakeoff , sideline, and approach-For each f lyover condition\nthe SPL, PNL, and PNLV rere calculated for each 1/2 second of the\nflight trajectory.\nThe duration time, duration correction,\neffeztive perceived noise level (EPNI.) for each source, and the\ntc Cal EPNL were calculated in accordance to FAR Part 36 procedures.\nFLYOVER NOISE CALIBRATION WITH MEASURED LEARJET DATA\n\nBased upon static data comparisons, the QCGAT engine demonstrated substantial reductions in noise levels compared to the\nquiet AiResearcn Model TFE731-2 engine thac powers the Learjet\n35/36 airplane. Tnis airplane is certified to be 5 =dB\nbelow the\nFAR Part 36 Stage 3 noise limits.\nHowever, the initial flyover\npredictions, based upon the previously describedmethodology, yielded\nQCGAT noise levels comparable to measured Learjet flyover noise\nl%vels. This methodology was thus used to predict the Learjet flycvcr noise levels to determ~neits validity.\nA corn~ariso~r the predicted and measured in-flight spectra\nof\nf ~ rthe Learjet 35/36 3ased upon the excess jet noise model, is\n\nshown in figure 22, Although the etatic noise predictions for the\nTFE731 engine were adjusted to match measured static noise levels,\nwhen taken to flight, the predictions are higher than the measured\nflyover levels, The overprediction occurs srimarily in the low\nfrequency, jet-dominated range. At the takeoff condition, the predicted f lyover EPNL is 88.7 EPNdB compared to a measured value of\n84 EPNdB. Similar differences between predicted and measured flyover noise l s \' s were observed at approach and sideline condiez.\nt ions.\n\nA second set of flyover predictions for the Learjet cer~ification tests were made based upon the core noise dominated nodel, as\nshown in figure 23.\nThe predicted levels are even higher than\nthose based upon the previous model, This is primarily due to the\nassumed dominance of core noise to which beneficial in-flight\nreductions are not applied.\nTable 7 compares the predicted and measured total EPNL for\ntakeoff and a~proachconditions for both predict ion mode 1s. The\nind iviiual noisa sources cannot be compared directly because the\nflight-path position for which the maximum tone-corrected perceived\nnoise level occurs is not the same, resulting in a different composition of noise sources.

The following conclusions were made:\no\n\nBased on the excess jet noise correlation model, the\nQCGAT engine met or bettered the program noise goals.\n\no\n\nBased on t h e excess core noise correlation, t h e -AT\nengine met or bettered the program noise goals both for\nhardwall and softwall nacelle configurations at sideline\nand approach conditions, and was slightly above t h e takeoff noise goal.\n\nThe AiResearch QCGAT program has demnstrated that it is possible to design quiet engines for general aviation aircraft,\n\nMinner, G.L. and Rice, E J ,\n..\n\'Ccmputer Method for Design of\nAcoustic Liners for Turbofan Engines," NASA TM X-3317, 1976.\nRice, E J ,\n..\n"Acoustic Liner Optimum Impedance for Spinning\nModes with Mode Cut-Off Ratio as the Design Criterion,\' AIAA\nPaper 76-516, Palo Alto, C . 1976.\nA,\n\n-\n\n.\nRice, E.

Terrill\nAvco Lycoming Division\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe multi-engine general aviation fleet size is expected to increase by\n70 percent in the decade of the 1980\'s according to the General Aviation\nManufacturers Association (GAMA). These general aviation aircraft typically\nuse suburban airports that are unprotected by commercial buffer zones. Consequently, there is the potential for general aviation to create nore widespread adverse community reaction to noise and ?ollution than that experienced with conrmercial air carrier aircraft. Recognizing this, NASA let contracts to apply large engine quieting and emissions reduction technology to\nsmaller engines and to develop new and more suitable technology where required. These resulting "Quiet, Clean, General Aviation Turbofan" (QCGAT)\ncontracts required delivery of a turbofan engine and nacelle demonstrator, as\nwell as preliminary defintion of an appropriate general aviatim aircraft\nsystem, that could use the engine as propulsion.\nThis paper describes the resulting aircraft/nacelle/engine designs\ncreated under the Avco Lycoming contract. These designs reflect the technical\nexpertise of the following subcontractors:\nAircraft Design - Beech Aircraft Corporation\nNacelle Mechanical Design - Avco Aerostructures\nNacelle Acoustic Treatment - Lockheed Aircraft Corporation\nAIRCRAFT PRELIMINARY DESIGN\nTo guide the aircraft system design, fivo primary objectives were established:\n\n1.\n\nPractical, direct application of technology without significant\nscaling was very important, This required selection of aircraft and\nengine sizes which trould be appropriate for an appreciable eegment\nof genercl aviation.\n\n2.\n\nThe aircraft must also offer attractive range, fuel economy, and\nflight speed. A target of 2593 kilometers (1400 nautical miles) was\nestablished. This exceeds the range of most current small business\naircraft. It also provides non-stop travel between opposite extremes\nof high density traffic areas.\n\n3.\n\nA cruise Mach Number of 0.62 was chosen as an optimum compromise betweeil time and fuel economy. It provides 40 percent higher cruise\nspeed chan a turboprop, with a 30 percent improvement ic fuel economy over operation at 0.8 Mach Number.\n\n4\n.\n\nA balanced field length of 762 meters (2500 feet) was desired because it permits safe operation from 70 percent of all U.S. airports\nwhich are open to the public, including airports with sod runways.\n\n5.\n\nEcological characteristics of an aircraft system are likely to become primary competitive parameters for general viation in the 1980\ndecade. Therefore, they deserve close attention in design selecrims.\n\nThe initial step in aircraft preliminary design was the selection of appropriate size and design. The vast majority of general aviation aircraft\noperating from airiields located in suburban communities are in the size\nclass below 5433 kg (12,000 lb) qross weight. In the lower extremity of the\ngross weight spectrum, small private aircraft in the range below 1814 kg\n(4,000 lb) are generally powered by single-piston engines. It is expected\nthat marker constraints for very low-cost aircraft in this class will dictate\ncontinued usage of piston engines for the foreseeable future. It, therefore,\nfollows that the greatest public ecological benefits can be realized by introduction of a quiet, clean "ircraft system in the 1811 - 5433 kg (4,000 12,000 lb) gross weight class. Figure 1 shoes the projected market volume for\nvarious sizes of general aviation aircraft.\nAs with the passenger c i trend towards smaller and more sophisticated\nir\ncars to perform the same function, it is expected that the decade of 1980\'s\nwill see a similar general aviation trend towards reduced aircraft weight and\nsmaller engine size for the same mission. Because noise, emissions, and fuel\nconsumption reduce with engine size, subsequent iaprovement in ecological\ncharacteristics can be anticipated. Utilizing technologies such as turbofan\npropulsion, high aspect ratio super critical wing and lightweight composite\nstructures, it is expected that a new class of small general aviation 3ircraft will emerge in the eighties. A target of 30 percent weight reduction\nwas considered achievable.\n\nFor aircraft size selection, our target was the largest segment of general aviation oircra : where cost of turbofan propulsio~ does not preclude\nits introduction.\nFigure 1 presents a composite plot of aircraft gross weight versus both\n"The Number of New Aircraft co be Built" and "The Current Estimated Nominal\nAircraft Cost". The number of aircraft is based on General Aviation Manufacturers Association data. The expected trend toward lighter weight and higher\ncost for the same mission has not been reflected to ensure conservative engine sizing. The range cf 3175 - 4536 kg (7,OOC to 10,000 lb) gross weight\nappeared attractive, with 3629 kg (8,CSO lb) selected as our goal.\nWith the defined aircraft golls and Lycoming estimates for engine performance, Beech Aircraft Corporati on conducted parametric studies co optimize\nthe aircraft preliminary design.\n\nThe aircraft which evolved is depicted in figure 2 It is a sleek, ad.\nvanced design, six-place aircraft with 3538. kg (7,800 lb) maximum gross\neight. l c offers a 2776 kilometer (1500 nautical mile) range with cruise\nspeed of 0.5 Mach Number and will take-off and land on the vast majority of\ngeneral aviation airfields. Advanced features include broad application of\ncomposite materials and a ~upercritical wing design with winglets. Full-span\nfowler flaps have been introduced to improve landing capability. Engines are\nfuselr;o-mounted with inlets over the wing to provide shielding of fan noise\nby the wing surfaces.\nThe high bypass ratio QCGAT engine plays an important role in shaping the\naircraft design. It offers a dramatic reduction in specific fuel consumption\nc q a r e d with current pure jets and lorto-moderate bypass ratio turbofans.\nFigure 3 provides this comparison, reflecting a 22 percent improvement in\nfuel economy.\nThis loti~r fuel consumption may be used in either of two ways or in cornbinat ion:\nIt can substantially reduce aircraft gross weight for the same\nrange. The reduced weight provides compound interest on the fuel\neconomy. It also requires lower thrust favoring reduction of noise\nand emissions.\nIf preferred, the lover fuel consumption can be translated into\nlonger range for the original gross weight.\nWe chose to reduce gross weight and favor ecological characteristics.\nComposite structures have been used extensively in the aircraft preliminary design to further reduce gross weight. Areas selected by Beech for the\napplicatian of composite materials are shown in figure 4 Kevlar graphite\n.\ncomposites were used for aircraft weight estimates. Further -potential for\nweight savings exists in the engine nacelles. Conventional design vas used to\nreflect the lorrisk, lorcost test nacelle. Critical load carrying members\nsuch as the wing spar are conventional aluminum construction.\nApproximately 40 percent of the structure is fiber epoxy or honeycmbbonded structure. The use of composite structure in aircraft design provides\na decreasing rate of ber;-.fit as the application of composites becomes more\nwidespread in the design. Initial selection of applications is in noncritical\naieas. As the stress in selected areas increases, the design safety fdctor\nalso increases to compensete for uncertainties resulting from the youth of\nthe composite application. Beech cautions that, while these composite applications are technicaliy feasible, development beyond the scope normally\nundertaken by industry would be required to assure success.\nStructura; design is ic accordance with Federal Aviation Regulation Part\n23 airwcrthiness standards for normal category airplanes.\n\nA 17 percent thickness-to-cl~or~i io supercri tical wing shape was selecrat\nted because it offers a i~umberof advantages over the conventional 12 percent\nNACA shape. These advstltages are summarized in figure 5.\n\nFrom thc cross sectional comparison shown here, it can 5e concluded\nthat the supercritical wing provides lsrger volume far fuel storage\nfor the samr ci1or.i vidth. The thickness increase has the supplementary benefit of higher section modu7.as, permitting lighter construction for cquivalcnt bending loads.\n\nThe two shapes Lave comparable drag characterist ics in the cruise\nmode. Increase in the NACA airfoil thickness in an attempt tt.\nachieve similar v.jlume is impractical, because it results in a significant reduction in useful flight speed combined with an overall\ndrag incrcast* at lower speeds.\nIterative design studies show a 25 percent increase in fuel capacity\ncombined with s 3 percent decrease in aircraft gross weight.

The 221 reduction in gross weight permits.\nthe use of a smaller engine with 22% lover thrust and, therefore, lower absolute emissians and noise.\n%\nt aircraft study projected the m a x i m ranges shown in figure 6 for\nvarious payloads. While 11% kg (2530 lb) is depicted as maximum payload for\nthe aircraft, only 7 5 3 kg (1660 ~ b ) is required to accommodate six people\nwith their baggage. At this payload, the achievable range is in excess of\n2963 kilometere ( 6 0 nautic\n10\nmiles). Flight coitditions are 10058 meters\n(33,000 feet) and an average flight speed of approximately 0.5 Mach Number.\nIn 9ti.r QCGAT aircraft study. landing distance, rather than take-off capability, set the minimnu usable air\xc2\xa3ield length. Introduction of full-span\nfowler flaps vith moderate wing loading results in a ver j low "landing configuration" stall speed. The 32 metersjscc (62 knots) stall speed compares\nvith 4 - $6 metersjsec (SO - 90 knots) for current typical jet and turbofan\n1\naircraft. Since landing distance is proportional to stall speed squared, this\nlow landing speed provides an attractive sea levei FAR landing field length\nof 811 meters (2603 feet).\n\nFigure 7 shims a representative sample of general aviation airfields\nplotted on cocrdinates of field elevation and field length. The Beech QCGAT\naircraft with full useful pavloads has a landing capability consistent with\nthe majority of these fields.\nThe expected stall spezds promise a very forgiving airplane in the takeoff and landing mode where most accidents occur.\n\nThe aircraft preliminary design was conducted to establish realistic criteria for noise measurement. Figure 8 depicts the iocations for noise aeasulement, as well as the aircraft and engine conditions at the point of\nmeasurement.\nApproach noise is measured directly below the flight path 1552 meters\n(one nautical mile) prior to the beginning of the runway. Approach aircraft\nglide slope is fixed at three degrees. Take-off sideline cc-sists ?\xc2\xa3 multiple\nmeasurements 463 meters (0.25 nautical miies) to ,one side of the take-off\nflight path. Take-off flyover condition is measured 6 4 8 2 meters ( 3 . 5 nautical\nmiles) from brake release, directly below the flight path.\nLooking at the tabulation of aircraft and engine conditions, the approach\nconditions are quoted for 40-degree wing flap angle. This gives the shortest\nlanding distance and the highest noise level. Where increase runway length is\n6\navailable, 1 degrees flaps could be ilsed. Velocity would increase to 55.5\nmeters/sec (108 knots) and thrust would rcduce to 818.4? n (184 1b)jenp;ine\nproviding further reduction in noise.\n\nWhere take-off sideline noise is measured at multiple locations, the altitude of 262 m (860 ft) produces the highest estimated noise. Conditions are\nsumarized for this altitude.\nClimb rate of the QCGAT aircraft approximates current aircraft of similar\nmission. It attains an altitude of 106 m (3630 ft) at the take-off flyover\nmeasurement point.\nENGINE DES IGN\n\nThis portion of the paper will touch on design objectives, noise, and\nemission considerations, engine cycle and engine description, and conclude\nwith specific design featurec.\nSefore proceeding into the details of the engine design, a brief reviev\nof the design objectives is in order.\n\nThe ecological characteristics of an aircraft system are a direct\nreflection of the engine design. Careful attention to engine design\ndetails which impact noise and emissions is required to produce an\nengine that will became a welcome resident in a suburban comwmity.\nAppeal of turbofans is indisputable. They swept virtually the entire\ncorrrmercial carrier market in a period of twenty years. The same\ntrend has started in general aviation with the larger size aircraft.\nThe rate of turbofan penetration into the smaller general aviation\naircraft size is a function of the engine cost. This cost generally\nequates to simplicity of engine configuration. The result is basic;\nto be successful, it must bc simple in configuration. Take-off\nthrust should be sufficient to permit operation from the majority of\ngeneral aviation airfields.\nThe mechanical design life goal should reflect the anticipated aircraft mission. Beech projected a useful aircraft life of 12,000\nhours with an average flight cycle lasting 90 minutes, Our design\ngoal wss to match this life without replacement of major parts.\nDespite the best intentions of the designer, parts do break and it\nis desirable to be able to replace them conveniently. Modular ensice\nconstruction achieves this goal.\n\nA\n\n12.191-meter (40,000-foot) flight\navoidance of traffic and bad weather.\n\nenvelopc\n\nThe need for fuel economy goes without saying.\n\nis\n\nattractive\n\nfor\n\nThe larger engines for comsrc ial carrier aircraft have demonstrated substantial advances in the technology of noise reduction. They have provided\nthe recipe for quiet engine design which was used for QCGAT and is sumarized\nin figure 9.\nBlend low fan blade tip speed and low fan pressure ratio with high\nfan bypass ratio.\nThe fan scator should t e set at least two fan blade chord lengths\naft from the blade trailing edge. The quantity of fan stator vanes\nshould exceed two times the number of fan blades to avoid interaction of fan blade wakes with the stator vanes. Canted stator vanes\nare preferred.\nExhaust noise reduces with exhaust velocity, and turbine blade-pass\nfrequency should exceed the audible range.\nDuring the iterations which optimize an engine performance cycle, continuous attention is required to avoid adverse impact on emissions characteristics. Table I1 summarizes the primary causes for emissions along with the engine parameters which have a beneficial influence on emissions.\nUnburner! hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions are primarily a\nreflection of poor combustor efficiency at idle. Low combustor inlet\ntemperature at idle aggravates the carbon monoxide emissions. To reduce these two constituents, one would strive for very high cabustor efficiency at idle combined with elevated combustor inlet temperature. To achieve the higher inlet temperature, a campressor with\npoor efficiency at low speed if desired. This cumpressor should then\nbe run as fast as idle thrust constraints will permit, and then\nbleed air to achieve even higher speed for the same thrust.\nWhereas idle conditions have the primary influence on URC and CO,\ntake-off conditions predominate in the creation of %. Generally,\nthe higher the combustor inlet temperature at take-off, the more\ndifficult the problem with NOX. Another important a x i a , !KIX and\nCO can usually be traded through conbustor design modification.\nEither emission can be improved at the expense of the other to\nachieve the desired combination.\nComments, so far. have ignored engine bypass ratio. Emissions are\nproduced exclusively in the core engine. The higher the bypass\nratio, the lower the emissions for a given thrust rating.\n\nA high-pressure compressor pressur? ratio of approximately 1011 under\ncruise conditions was selected as being achievable without compromise in configuration simplicity. Demonstrated component technology indicated two transonic axial stages combined with a single centrifugal stage would be sufficient. Modest work input requirements for this compressor permit selection of\na single-stage air-cooled twbine drive.\nA\nn\n\nN4[ emission goal was considered the most difficult to achieve, with\n\nhigh-pressure ratio engines requiring a complex combustor configuration. Because y emissions increase with pressure ratio, this 1011 pressure ratio\nselection also favored ccmbustor configuration simplicity.\nFigure 10 shows the results of one of many parametric performance studies\nconducted during the cycle selection phase. This particular study was conducted for 7620 meters (25,000 feet) cruise at 0 6 Mach Number. Engine perform.\nance is plotted two w)\nas for comparison. The chart on the left provides bare\nengine performance as it would be measured in an altitude test chamber. The\nrighthand chart modified the SFC coordinate to reflect installed specific\nfuel consumption. Here, losses associated with nacelle drag and weight are\nfactored in as the nacelle size varies with engine bypass ratio.\nPerformance for a variety of fan bypass ratios are plotted on coordinates\nof specific fuel consumption and fan pressure ratio. In both figures, specific fuel consumption is seen to reduce with increasing fan bypass ratio up to\na ratio of 1011. Optimum fan pressure ratio decreases with increasing bypass\nratio.\nA fan bypass ratio of 9.6/1 at cruise was selected to limit required input work to the capability of a single-stage fan drive turbine. The corresponding fan pressure ratio was set at 1.35.\n\nThe engine was sized to produce in excess of 7117 N (1600 lb) of thrust\nunder sea level static operating conditions. Sea level and altitude performance are suunnarized in table 111. This perforntnce compares favorably vith\neven larger, more scphisticated engines currently in use.\nFigure 11 schematicallv shows the engine configuration we selected. The\ngas generator section was not funded by the NASA QCGAT Program. R e engine\nhas only six rotating cascades in total, and only two in the hot section\nwhere maintenance costs normally accrue. As such, it achieves the simplicity\nnecessary to penetrate the medium aiicraft size general aviation cost barrier.\nThe configuration is a high-bypass turbofan composed of a single-stage\nfan, a gas generator section, and a single-stage, low-pressure, fan-drive\nturbine.\nInitial compression is provided by the fan stage with the major<ty of the\nair bypassing the gas generator section to produce thrust directly, much as a\nsmall propeller would. Air flowing through the hub of the fan enter* the gas\ngenerator and is further compressed by the high-pressure compressor.\n\nA reverse-flow annular atomizing combustor accommodated fuel burning and\nenergy release. Hot gases take a second 180 degree turn before floving\nthrough the high-pressure compressor-drive turbine.\nThese gases then continue axially aft through the fan-drive turbine.\nPower from this turbine is transmitted forward by a shaft that is concentric\nwithin the hollow gas generator shaft. Rotational speed is reduced by a reduction gear to match the optimum fan engine.\nThe advantages of the selected configuration are numerous. Initial studies projected attractive specific fuel consumption while maintaining the\ndesired simplicity of only six rotating cascades. Compliance vith the recipe\nfor low noise and emissions has been achieved. The reverse-flow canbustor\npermits packaging the gas generator turbine inside the combustor to achieve a\nshort coupled engine, thus avoiding difficulties of casing deformation and\nshaft natural frequencies. The resulting engine center-of-gravity is close to\nthe axial plane of the main engine mounts, simplifying installation requirement s.\nUse of the reduction gear permits individual speed optimization to\nachieve the best efficiency for the fan and the single-stage low-pressure\nturbine. Also, the low-pressure turbine may then operate at higher rotational\nspeeds where blade pass frequencies, a common noise source, are outside the\naudible tone spectrum even vnder low-speed aircraft approach conditions.\n2\nOverall, engine configuration is shown cross sectionally in figure 1 .\nExternal dimensions are approximately 610 mm X 910 nan ( 2 feet X 3 feet), not\nincluding the accessory gearbox.\n~elical reduction gearing introduces an axial mechanical load which opposes aerodynamic loads on both the fan and the low-pressure turbine. This\nprovides a significant reduction in thrust loads on the ball bearings in both\nthe fan and low-pressure, turbine rotor systems.\nThe accessory gearbox is chin-mounted at the b o t t m of the main frame for\nesse of maintenance without core cowl removal. Accessory drive is provided\nfrom the high-pressure rotor spool via a conventional bevel gear mesh and\nthrough-shaf t with intermediate bearing support.\n\nFigure 13 shows the modular maintenance features of the engine. The engine disassembles into four basic modules, as shown. The fan module includes\nfan, stators, reduction gear, and main engine frame. The core module contains\nthe high-pressure compressor, its drive turbine, and the combustor.\nSeparation of the gas generator and low-pressure turbine modules allows\nvisual inspection of all the hot-section components. Full disassembly of both\nmodules was demonstrated to NASA representatives during the short period of a\ncoffee break at one of our coordination meetings.\nOn the wing maintenance is virtually unlimited by engine configuration.\nHot-sect ion inspect ion, fan blade accessory replacements, gas generators and\nlow-pressure turbine module exchanges are but a few of the options available\nto the operator.\n110\n\nThe QCGAT engine fan module is depicted in figure 14. The fan blade tip\ndiameter is approximately 559 mm (22 in.) with a modest tip speed of 335\nmeter/second ( 1 100 feet/second! at take-of f conditions. The ratio of stator\n.6\nvanes to fan blades is 2 4 for acoustic considerations. The distance between\nthe fan blade trailing edge and the fan stator vane leading edge has been\nmaintained at 2.1 fan blade chord lengths to minimize noise from rotating\nblade wakes. The fan stator is canted aft to maximize this distance for a\ngiven engine length.\nThe reduction gear permits high turbine rctati onal speed producing a\nblade-pass frequency which is above the audible range, even under reduced\npower approach conditions.\nFan blade containment capability has been provided in the fan shroud\ndesign. Imbalance i\nl-ting from blade loss, has been a design criteria for\nthe supporting strc\n\n-.\n\nHot oil sprayed into the hub of the spinner provides continuous antiicing and additional oil cooling.\nFigure 15 shows an assembled fan vheel. 15ere are 24 rugged long-chord\nfan blades which are designed to withstand bird impact without the support of\na mid-span shroud. Fewer, long-chord blades were selected as being preferable\nto a higher quantity of short-chord blades incorporating midspan dampers.\nThis reduces wheel cost and avoids the performance penalties associated with\nmidspan shrouds.\n\n6\nFigure 1 depicts the fan bypass stator assembly. In this design, the\nstator vanes are manually inserted into potted boots retained in the inner\nand outer shrouds. This feature permits individual vane replacement rather\nthan returning the entire assembly for overhaul repair in the event of foreign object damage.\nframe is shown in figure 17. The frame is inteThe QCGAT mairr -.-ttl~ctural\ngrally cast of aluminuni. Four engine mounting bosses are provided to permit\nselection by the airframe designer for top, side. or bottom engine mounting.\nA cross-section of the QCGAT core engine is shown in figure 1 . The com8\npressor and turbine stages are mounted on a hallow shaft which acts as a\nthroughbolt furnishing the necessary clamping force for the rotor system.\n\nThe compressor rotor thrust load is carried by a ball bearing at the\nfront end. A spring-loaded ball bearing at the end of the shaft permits expansion while maintaining radial posit ion. Accessory drive is taken from this\nrotor by means of a bevel gear drive.\n\' t o ball bearings, supporting the fan-drive turbine rotor, are contained\nIr\nwhich supports the aft high-pressure rotor bearing. This\nin the same h0usi.n~\navoids the cost of iubricating and sezling individual packages. A concentric\ndrive shaft through the high-pressure rotor delivers the fan-dr ive turbine\npower to the fan module.\n\nAll rotating cascades for both the high-compressor and low-pressure turbine rotors are integrally cast to reduce cost. Air cooling is confined to\nthe high-pressure turbine.\nBlade loss containment is provided throughout.\nThe combustor is a folded annular atomizing burner.\nIn a conventional atomizing combustor, an axial vortex is generated\naround each atomizer by swirling the air with vanes. In the QCGCT size combustor, sixteen atomizers and swirlers would have been required to attain\neven, circumferential, temperature distribution.\nFigure 19 shows the "circumf erentially stirred" con\xc2\xa3iguration which was\nselected in preference to the conventional combustor. Primary air is admitted\nthrough slots in the liner header producing flow circulation in a circumferentially oriented vortex. Secozdary air jets, called "folding jets", enter\nthe inner wall directly downstream of each atomizer and force the circumferential vortex into a horseshoe shape as it flows downstream. In this manner,\ntwo downstream vortexes are created for each atomizer, and the required number of atomizers is cut by one-half, to eight.\nPrior testing has shown this configuration to be superior to conventional\ncombustors in emissions characteristics. It also demonstrated significant\nmargin in UHC and CO but was initially somewhat above QCGAT 134( goals. This\npermitted the trade-off of CO for NOX mentioned previously to assure\nachievement of NOX goa 1s\n\n.\n\nAs a result of this intensive design effort, the first QCGAT engine was\nassembled in Gctober 1978. In figure 20, the core engine module is shown\nbeing connected to the fan module. Figure 21 is a front 3/4 view of the basic\nengine fully assembled. The addition of the test inlet bellmouth, plus the\ncore engine cowling, is depicted in figure 22.\nFigure 23 shows the birth of a new engine model installed in the test\ncell just prior to its initial test run. Fizlre 24 is an enlarged view of the\nengine installed. The first engine run was in October 1978. A 30-hour mechanical verification test was cmpleted in April 1979. May and June were\ndevoted to damping an undesirable resonance in the ring gear. Emission tests\nwere conducted in July.\nFigure 25 shows the engine at the acoustic test site during the acoustic\ntesting phase of the program, which was completed in August. The demonstrator\nengine was then inspected, acceptance tested, and delivered to NASA in October 1979.\n\nNACELLE DESIGN\n\nA preliminary design in the flight nacelle was defined to establish a\nrealistic baseline from which a ground test nacelle could duplicate the important features at reduced program cost. Only the ground Lest nacelle was\nfabricated.\nAn artist\'s conception of thz flight n~celle is shown in figure 26. The\nnacelle is composed of the following sections:\n1.\n\nAn inlet duct to provide uniform flow into the engine\n\n2\n.\n\nA fan outer duct and core cowl to guide the bypass air around the\nengine\n\n3\n.\n\nA mixer assembly to force the mixing of hot, higher velocity core\nengine exhaust with the cooler, low velocity fan stream\n\n4.\n\nA confluent mixing chamber preceding the final nacelle exit nozzle\n\n5.\n\nAn\n\naerodynamically shaped outer skin, designed to minimize drag at\nthe higher flight speeds.\n\nA mixed-flow confluent exhaust system was selected because it reduces the\npeak axit velocity, improves propulsive efficiency, and reduces jet noise.\n\nNoise attenuation treatment in the f o m of perforated acoustic panels has\nbeen introduced in the air intake section and in the fan duct outer wall.\nFigure 27 shows the enginelnacelle mounting and maintenance access\npanels. The engine is designed to carry the nacelle aerodynamic and "G"\nloads. An airframe or nacelle yoke attaches to two points on the engine main\nframe plus an aft steady link. The entire nacelle is then carried by the\nappropriate engine flanges. Four access panels are provided for ease of maintenance.\nThe nacelle aerodynamic contours, summarized in figure 28, are optimized\nfor. low drag at 0.65 Mach Number, 10688-meter (35,000-foot) cruise conditions. The intake is designed for high cruise efficiency with modest compromises for static 20.6 meters/sec (40-knot) crosswind tolerance and pressure\nrecovery at low-speed take-off conditions. A NASA/McDonnell-Douglas computer\nprogram for three dimensional flow calculations has been used for predicting\ninlet cowl flow conditions. This program computes flow over axisymmetric bodies at various flow angles of attack. Inlet and fan duct flow velocities are\n.\ngenerally below 0 4 Mach Number.\nThe nacelle is circular in cross-section except for the bottom portion\nwhich expands into an elliptical section to house the engine accessories.\n4\nBoat tail angles vary from 1 to 18 degrees.\n\nThe QCGAT ground test nacelle which was used to explore noise and emissions reduction is shown in figure 29. The internal flow lines, flight inlet\nlip, and the exhaust nozzle are identical to the flight nacelle. External\nskin was eliminated to reduce program cost.\nFlight-worthy hardwall and noise attenuation panels can be readily exchanged as desired.\nThree inlet lip configurations (figure 30) which were tested with the\n\nQCGAT engine are as follows:\n\n1.\n\nAn inlet bellmouth for 1.oss-free baseline calibration\n\n2.\n\nAn exact replica of the flight nacelle lip\n\n3.\n\nA lip designed to simulate landing approach inflow conditions.\n\nThe flight lip and the inlet bellmouth are compared in figure 31.\nFigure 32 shows two views of the mixer nozzle. Studies showed seven lobes\nto be the optimum for our engine. We selected six, with a very minor performance penalty, to avoid any possible seventh-order upstream excitation of turbine blading. Both shaker tests and engine strain gage testing showed satisfactory dynamic characteristics.\nCONCLUSIONS\nChallenging objectives were set for the QCGAT aircraft preliminary design\nto respond to our assessment of general aviatioil needs for the 1980 decade.\nThe aircraft design achieves these objectives to provide six-place, long-distance flight which will be at~ractive to both the user and the suburban community\n\n.\n\nFlight characteristics of this aircraft have been computed to define\nrealistic criteria for measurement of ecological characteristics.\nReflecting on the engine and nacelle designs, the primary objectives of\nthe QCGAT Program have been fulfilled. Large engine noise reduction technology has been successfully employed to the general aviation size engine. The\nQCGAT Program culminated in demonstration of QCGAT acoustic goals with margin.\nA simplified approach to emissions was conceived in response to this program, and the QCGAT goals for emissions were very nearly achieved. Considerable margin was demonstrated for both CO and YHC emissions and NOX was\nwithin 1 percent of the goal.\n\nQCGAT has given birth to a new engine which is designed to serve the\nneeds of general aviation in the 1980\'s. While still in its infancy, it has\ndemonstrated attractive performance by current standards. Further development\ntuning will be required to achieve its full potential which is reflected in\n\nthe QCCAT performance goals. Component tests have verified the long term objectives. However, turbine rematch is required .to recoup the inherent configuration performarice.\nVersatile ground test nacelles were created to investigate ecological\ndesig parameters. Acoustic panels versus hardwall and mixed exhaust versus\nsplit streams were tested under this program.\n\nTABLE I\n\nBENEFITS FROM ADVANCED\nAIRCRAFT DESIGN\n\n/\n\nFUEL\n\nmcYn\nCONFI~UR*TION\n\nI\n\nCurrent\nAircraft\n\n\'1\n\nr::fZj\n1.368\n(3.016)\n\nI\n1\n\nSTRUCIURIYD\nPROPULSION\n\nwsanr, ra grq\n\nI\n1\n\n2.518\n(5.551)\n\n2 390\n\nQROIS\n\nWEtoWr.\n(Lm)\n\n4,548\n\n(9.8601\n\n1\n1\n\n4,013\n:8.848)\nr\n\nUse Composites\nSupercritical Wing\n\nSAVINGS\n\n(2: 53)\n\n(4.3GO)\n\n3.53\n(7.800)\n\n32%\n\n23%\n\n22%\n\n-.\n\nL\n\nTABLE I1\n\nDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR EMISSIONS\nEMISSION\n\nCAUSE\n\nUnburned Hydrocarbons\n\nCombuslion inefficiency\n\nCarbon Monoxide\n\nNO::\n\nInadequate: Residence Time.\nTemperature,\nEf!iciency\nHigh Residence T~me/lemperature\n\nSmoke\n\nLocal Rich Zones\n\n8\n\nBenef~cial\nEngine Characteristics:\nHigh Combustion Efflc~ency ldle\nat\n\nH:gh Combustor Inlet Temperature at ldle\n(High Speed.

The engine, which was built and tested a t Lycoming, has\nmet and, in some cases, surpassed the design goals for emissions.\nThe engine program has also demonstrated that emissions and noise reduction technology can be effectively applied to small turbofan engines\nwithout significant performance penalties.\n\nThis paper describes the basis for the cycle and coxr~ponentselection, for the Avco Lycoming - NASA QCGAT engine, and the resulting\ndemonstrated performance and emissions of the complete engine. An\nartist\'s conception of a cut-away view of the propulsion system is shown\nin figure 1.\nThe Avco Lycoming QCGAT engine is a high bypass ratio, twin\nspool turbofan engine of modular design. It incorporates a front fan\nmodule driven by the Ll SlOl core engine modified, a s required, to\nachieve the QCGAT goals. The engine i s housed in a nacelle incorporating full length fan ducting with sound treatment in both the inlet and fan\ndischarge flow paths.\nDesign goals of components developed under this contract and\nresults of component tests a r e presented, herein, together with full\nengine test results.\nIn the emissions portion oi this paper, the rational behind the\ncombustor design selected for the Avco Lycoming QCGAT engine is\npresented a s well a s the test results. Total system (engine and nacelle)\ntest results a r e also presented.\n\nLycomingl s goal under this contract r r s not only to demoartrate\nthe transfer of state-of-the-art acoustics and emissions technology\ncurrently used on large engines to smrlf engines, but t build this\no\naround a high performance engine aad airframe system attractive for\nthe 1980\'s and beyond, It is clear that a high performance fan engine\nintegrated with an advanced airframe design concept is advantageous\nwn\nprimarily for high performance t i engine aircraft currently propelled\nby piston o r small turboprop engines in the 373 (500) t 746 (1000)\no\nkilcwatt (shaft horsepower) class. This segment of the market which\nhas recently shown a strong growth, is expected to continue, especially\nwith the introduction of a quiet, clean high performance aircraft r h i c h\noffers the highest benef<t, in terms of noise and pollution reduction, for\nthose communities living at airport boundaries\n\nThe engine installed in the aircraft must offer modern high performance, economical cruise speeds beyond the reach of present turboprop\napplications a d a range over 2224 kilometers (1200) (nautical miles).\nt\nPrime cruise altitude was targeted for 7620 m (25,000 ft ) a Mach 0.6.\nwith a potential to climb and cruise a l2,192 m (40,000 \xc2\xa3to )\nt\nThese\ntargets were based on data received from aircraft operators\n\n-\n\nPERFORMANCE GYCLE ANALYSIS\nDesign and trade-off studies were performed to define the optimum\ncycle in terms of noise, emissions and performance.\nThe rational\nused t select the overall engine characteristics and the fan configurao\ntion is exemplified in figures 2 and 3. The optimization study assumed\ncomponent efficiencie s expected at the critical operating conditions:\nsea level, static take-off\n7620 m (25,030 f t ) Mach 0.6 cruise\nZ524 m (5.000 f t ) , hot day single engine climbout\nFigure 2 shows engine specific fuel consumption (SFC) versus fan\npressure ratio for selected values of bypass ratio. As shown, there\ni s a point of minimum specific fuel consumption for each fan bypass\nratio. Higher bypass ratios coupled with lower fan pressure ratios\nresults in lower specific fuel consumption. This, however, has to\nbe moderated because of two factors: installation losses and mechanical complexity. An increase in engine bypass ratio results in increased\nengine-nacelle drag and weight, which in turn causes an increase in airframe weight o r reduction in payload. Also, further increase of the bypass ratio would require a variable geometry exhaust nozzle to prevent\nexcessive fan unloading with resulting loss in fan cruise efficiencies.\n\nThe effect of an increase in cycle pressure ratio on SFC is shown in\nfigure 3 Although, increasing cycle pressure ratio d e c r e a s * ~\n.\nSFC,\nany increases in high compressor pressure ratio beyond approximately\n10.2 would require the added complexity of an additional low pressure\nturbine stage.\nAs a result of the design study, an initial design bypass ratio of\n9.6 and high compressor pressure ratio of 10.2 were selected. Installation weight and nacelle drag effects were considered.\nThe iz-pact of the selected cruise design point on the maximum\nthrust, at the critical single engine climbout condition 3 0 8 (555%)\n~ ~\nambient day a t 1524 m (5,000 f t ) , 69.5 m/ sec (135 knots) was examined. This flight requirement was used to size the engine.\n\nIt was found that the 7620 m (25,000 f. ) Mach 0.6 design point.\nt\nwhen lapsed to 1524 m (5,000 fb 1 , produces a maximum thrust for the\nselected bypass ratio.\nThe selected design cycle is presented in table L The changes in\nthe engine parameters, shown in the table 1, from initial perforxllance\nanalysis were caused by detail component design and final cycle optimization for maximum thrust at the single engine climbout condition.\n\nT h QCCXT engine installed performance goals for the two prime\nflight conditions a r e shown in table 2 This installed performance is\n.\nwith the nacelle system including the flight lip, mixer nozzle and\nacoustic treatment The sea level static take-off thrust i s 7166 N\n(1611 1bf) and specific fuel consumption i s 0.037 kg/ h r / N (0,363 lbm/ h r /\nlbf). For the 7620 m (25,000 ft. ) Mach 0.6 cruise, the thrust is 2157 N\n(485 lbf) and specific fuel consumption i s 0.064 kg/ h r / N (0,628 lbm/ h r /\nlbf)\nA mixer nozzle, reference 1, was chosen for the engine configuration because of acoustic and performance reasons. Figure 4 presents\nthe estimated variations of specific fuel consumption, along an engine\noperating line, with total net thrust at the selected cruise condition,\nfor the split and forced mixer exhaust systems. As shown, a potential\nperformance gain, at the cruise thrust, of approximately 3.0 percent\ncould be realized with a mixer.\n\nCOMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND TEST\nCore Engine Definition\nThe Avco Lycomiag LTSlOl turboshaft engine w a s selected a s\nthe basic core for QCGAT engine. Core component modifications\nrequired, to meet QCGAT design goals, were Lycoming funded.\nComponent Development\nThe major components developed, under the NASA contract,\nwere thc fan module, reduction gearing and the nacelle system which\nincludes the forced mixer nozzle. The fan and M C ~ & were designed\nwith tow noise as a primary criteria.\n\nIn addition, combustor system modifications were made, as required, to meet the emissions goals.\nCore Compressor\nThe core compressor w a s tested to establish mechanical and\naerodynamic performance with the turbofan inlet d u c t The compressor\nperformance and surge characteristics with pressure distortion a s\nmeasured during the fan component testing were also established.\nThe rig test results showed that the compressor efficiency was\nwithin L 0 percent of the design g o a l\nThe compressor showed high tole r a c e to pressure distortion\nproduced by the fan.\nAlso, the turbofan inlet duct caused a reduction in airflow to the\ncompressor of L 0 percent at the QCGAT operating conditionsGas P r d u c e r Turbine\nRig tests on the initial gas producer turbine hardware confirmed\nthat the design efficiency cr this stage was met within L 0 percent.\nHowever, the nozzles were substantially larger in flow area than design.\nAn attempt was made to correct for flow size, by reducing the\nannulus area formed by the inner and outer wall contour. This corrected\nthe flow area prcblem but caused cascade losses which reduced stage\nperformance by approximately 3 points.\n\nIn addition, the interturbine duct pressure 10sse s increased\nbecause of a resulting change in the turbine exit swirl angle.\nA redesign of the nozzle and rotor, to recover gas producer\nefficiency, was completed in July 1979 and the revised hardware is\nbeing procured\nFan Component\n\nA a experimental evaluation of the QCGAT fan module has shown\nthat the bypass performance has exceeded design goals. At the design\npressure ratio (L38) and speed (U,\n200 RPM), stage polytropic\nefficiency of 0.875 was demonstrated. This exceeded the design goal\nefficiency of 0.870.\nBypass airflow at this point was 33.7 kg/ sec\n( 7 4 3 lbm/ sec) compared with a goal of 33.6 kg/ sec ( 7 8 0 lbm/ sec).\nLimited distortion testing was done to insure mtisfactory engine\noperatioh The response of a turbofan to inlet distortion is of prime\nimportance from the viewpoint of aerodynamic performance and mechanical integrity of the blader Significant distortions occur in aircraft\ninstallations as a result of intake flow separation induced either by\ncrosswinds o r high angles of attack.\nThe Lycoming QCGAT fan rotor demonstrated very good aerodynamic and mechanical performance under inlet distortion conditions which\na r e representative, o r in excess, of those found in typical turbofan\ninstallations.\nLow Pressure Turbine\n\nThe low pressure turbine, which was not rig tested, appeared to\nperform as anticipated based on measured engine data.\nCOMPONENT STATUS SUMMARY\n\nEngine performance estimates obtained from math model simulations, based upon component test re sults, showed that further component\ndevelopment of the core, which was initiated in the spring of 1979, was\nrequired to achieve performance goals.\nHowever, a s a result of the analysis, it was concluded that the\nLycoming QCGAT engine was a viable vehicle for demonstrating noise,\nemissions and specific fuel consumption improvements which were the\nprogram* s objective s.\n\nFULL ENGINE TESTS\nReferee Configuration\nFollowing the component rig tests, the full engine and nacelle\nsystem tests were conducted. Two engine configurations have been\nte sted. The referee configuration consists of a calibrated bellxxmuth\nfollowed by a straight inlet duct to the fan shroud as shown in figure 5.\n\nIn the exhaust system, the bypass and core flows a r e physically\nseparated (see figure 6). Separate exhaust nozzles permit individual\nchange of fan pressure ratio and variation of the power split between\nthe fan and ccre.\nTest Nacelle Configuration\nI\nThe QCGAT test nacelle configuration is shown, in figure \', with\nthe flight inlet lip and diffusing duct which is mounted to the f a n mhroud.\nThe flight lip can be readily interchanged with the bellmouth o r the\napproach simulator inlets\n\n.\nDetails of the test nacelle a r e shown in figure 8 The diffusing\nduct following the inlet contains interchangeable hardwall o r acou~tically\ntreated softwall liners. The nacelle rear section consists of a core cowl\ncovering the core engine while providing a smooth aerodynamic inner\nwall contour for the : n flow surrounding the core. The common mired\ni\nexhaust nozzle clamps to the r e a r face of the fan frame and contains the\nremovable duct portion of either hardwall o r softwall panela\n\nEngine Test Plan\nVarious combinations of the two basic engine configurations, the\nreferee and te st nacelle, were tested during the performance calibration\nsequence.\nTable 3 shows an overview of the 7 prime engine configurations\nwhich were tested in order to determine the performance characteristics of the engine and nacelle system components. Prior to these tests,\na baseline engine configuration was tested with a calibrated bellmouth\ncoupled to a constant area duct and split exhaust\n\nThe first three configurations, listed in table 3, with the split, o r\nreferee exhaust system, were tested with the diffusing flight inlet duct\nand the various interchangeable inlet l i p s\n\nA l tests with the split exhaust were performed without f i e\nl\nacoustic panels. The referee configuration with a bellmouth inlet was\nalso used for the emissions sampling.\nThe test nacelle configuration with the mixed exhaust was initially\ntested, for performance purposes, only with the bellmouth inlet. First,\ntests were conducted with hardwall panels in the inlet and fan bypass\nexhaust. Then acoustic panels were placed in the inlet only. Finally,\nthe engine was tested with acoustic panels in both the inlet and fan bypass exhaust The installed performance demonstration was with the\nflight nacelle inlet, mixer nozzle and full acoustic treatment.\nReferee Engine Tests\nThe purpose of the initial tests with the referee configuration w a s to\nevalclate mechanical engine operation and stress levels on fan and gear\ncomponents\nSubsequent tests using the referee system, were conducted to evaluate overall engine and component performance prior to evaluating\nlosses associated with acoustically treated nacelle system. Variations\nin performance attributed to the mixer system was also to be determined\nThe purpose of these tests were twofold: first, to establish a base\ncalibration for determining component performance. Secondly, to evaluate inlet pressure losses associated with the diffusing duct coupled to\nthe various inlet lips. As previously stated, emissions sampling was\nalso conducted using the split exhaust configuration.\nDetailed analysis of test data has indicated that the diffusing duct\nand various inlets had a negligible impact on the overall engine performance. The engine test results with the referee configuration confirmed\nthe predicted engine performance.\nNacelle Engine Tests\nFollowing the referee system performance and emissions tests,\nthe installed nacelle test sequence was conducted. The purpose of these\ntests was twofold: first, to establish engine performance with a mixer\nnozzle; second, to evaluate the impact of the inlet and fan bypass exhaust\nacoustical panels on engine performance. After the performance evaluation tests, the engine was transferred to the acoustic test site for noise\nevaluation.\n\nTable 4 shows a comparison between the demonstrated installed\nengine thrust and specific fuel consumption with the design goals.\nThe measured static thrust and specific fuel consumption are 6485 N\n(1458 lbf) and 0.0400 k g / h r / N (0.392 lbm/hr/lbf). The cruise performance was estimated based upon engine static test data and component rig test results.\n\nPERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nEngine test results indicated that the acoustic panels, used for\nnoise reduction, had a negligible influence OF, the overall engine performance. The estimated cruise performance of the Avco Lycoming\nQCGAT engine, in terms of specific fuel consumption, i s approxirnately a 10.0 percent improvement over currently available small turbofan\nengines in the 13,344 N (3000 lbf) o r less thrust class.\nAlso, although the program performaxe goals were not achieved,\nthe loss in engine performance has been identified a s deficiencies in the\nturbine section of the core engine. The performance of the fan, which\nwas developed under the NASA contract, exceeded the design goal s\n.\nA redesign of the affected hardware has been completea under a separate\nLycoming funded program. Rig tests a r e scheduled to be conducted to\nevaluate the redesign a s soon a s the hardware i s available.\nEMISSIONS\nEmission Standards\nIn 1970, Congress passed the Clean Air Act. This Act, which was\nto be effective in 197.. , directed the Environmental Protection Agency to\ne stablish emissions standards applicable to aircraft, These standards,\nreference 2, for small turbofan aircraft, which have now been abandoned\nby the EPA, were kept a s NASA goals for the QCGAT engine program.\nTo achieve these emissions limits, the basic combustor design used in\nthe LTSlOl engine, references 3 and 4, was selected.\nCombustor Design\nThis design, which i s a circumferentially stirred combustor, is\n.\nshown in figure 9 In principle, the primary air is admitted through\nslots in the liner header producing flow circulation about a circumferential mean line. Air jets, called "folding jets" entering through the inner\nwall reinforce the primary zone recirculation, and the vortex fills the\n\nfull annular height of the liner.\nThe vortex spreads circurnferentially in both directions and i s\nforced to turn in the axial direction on either side of the folding jets\nand the mean path of the combustion zone flow vortex takes the shape\nof a horseshoe. The number of fuel injectors i s thereby reduced by one\nhalf, compared with normal practice, because of L !s unique combustor\nprimary zone aerodynamic concept.\nEmissions Projections\nEmission measurements, for this type of comtustor, attained from\nthe LTSlOl engine were available for use in predicting emissions for the\nQCGAT performance cycle. Table 5 shows the estimated emissions\nvalue s, for the QCGAT cycle, with the production LTSlOl conlbustor.\nThese EPA parameters were generated for a take-off and landing cycle\nfor class T1 aircraft (reference 2).\nThese emissions projections indicated that further development of\nwas required to reduce smoke. The hot end\nthe LTSlOl c o m b ~ s t o r\ndurability was in question because of the more severe operating conditions of the QCGAT engine.\nCombustor Modifications\nAirblast injectors, which replaced the dual orifice injectors,\nwere selected to reduce smoke. The introduction of the airblast inject o r s also increased combustor efficiency and oxides of nitrogen (NOx)\na t idle.\nIncreasing the ccmbustor pressure drop for temperature distribution control, also increased NOx and combustor efficiency while appreciably decreasing carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons. This\ni s typical of the impraved primary zone mixing, which results from the\nhigher pre s sure drop.\nAir partition modifications were then made, a s required, to meet\nthe design goals for NOx.\nFigure 10 presents the effect of a j r partition modifications on NOx.\nUnburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide we r e within the goals in\nall tests. Initially, the NOx slope for the LTSlOl combustor was a s\npredicted, and met the goal. However, a s the combustor pressure drop\nwas increased to reduce smoke, NOx increased.\n\nAir partition xnodifications, a s previously stated, were then made\nto meet the NOx emissions goal.\nThe final selected QCGAT liner, which met the goal, has a slightly\nsteeper slope than the initial configuration.\nThe Lipfert correlation, reference 5, for conventional combustors\ni s shown for comparison.\nEmis sions Sampling\nDevelopment and initial emissions testing of the combustor was\ncond~lcte? the laboratory. After the laboratory tests, the QCGAT\nin\nliner was transferred to the engine for demonstrated emissions\nsampling.\nThe e.missions test probes were installed a s shown in figure 1 .\n1\nThe probes, which a r e cruciform-shaped, were set at two angular\npositions. One probe measured along the horizontal and vertical axes.\nThe othtr probe was rotated 45 degrees.\nTable 6 i s a comparison of the =missions test results with the\nNASA goals. Measurements from the engine test showed that the\nunburned hydrocarbons were 60 percent lower than required. The\ncarbon monoxide was 30 percent lower, oxides of nitrogen L 0 percent\nhigher and the smoke number 50 percent lower than the goal.\nEMISSIONS SUMMARY\nThe emissions requirements of the QCGAT engine have been met\nand, in most cases, surpassed. The QCGAT com5ustor ~ 5 3 v i d e s\nsubstantial margin for carbon mc.noxi~ and unburned hydrocarbons\ne\nemi s sions while meeting the goal for NOx within the scope of the program.\nThe com5ustor sys tem modifications required to meet the emissions\ngoals had a negligible effect on engine performance.\nCONCLUSION\nThe QCGAT developmc rlt program was designed to demonstrate, as\nwell a s advance, state-of-the-art technology with regard to noise,\nemissions and fuel economy of small turbofan engines used in general\naviation- type aircraft. The program objectives, in terms of ern is sic..^\nand fuel consumption, were m e t\n\nWith the knowledge and experience gained through the NASAAvco Lycomin8 engine program, the thrust and SFC goals, although\nnot demonstrated within the time period of the program, a r e achievable\nwith additional component development.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. 3.

And this work is still in p r o g r e s s a s can be witnessed by the\ncomplexity of the facilities at the Lewis Research Center and elsewhere.\nThe majority of this work, however, has been directed toward the\ncommercial transport c l a s s of engines. The QCGAT p r o g r a m was designed\nto broaden the scope of this effort to include the general aviation size\nengine. The significant features of t h e QCGAT design a r e the low exhaust\nvelocity achieved by a high bypass fan design, the use of a mixer, no\ninlet guide vanes, subsonic fan blade design, large blade to vane spacing,\na high vane to blade ratio, the acoilstical lining of the inlet and discharge\nfan ducts and the u s e of a long inlet duct. The nacelle and a i r c r a f t play\nan important roll in incorporating these f e a t u r e s in the overall acoustic\ndesign. F o r example, the m i x e r i s enclosed in a shroud formed by the\nnacelle. The fact that forward airspeed mitigates the amount of jet noise\n\ngenerated has also been factored into the design. These features were\noptimized for the QCGAT aircraft based upon the results of our prediction\nof the acoustical performance of the engine aircraft system and the impact\nof each component on the overall design. The QCGAT noise goals were\nselected by NASA to force a design that included the latest noise control\ntechnology. We responded with an engine design that consisted of adding\na new fan design module that incorporated the latest noise techniques of\none our turboshaft engines. Our original estimates of the engine noise\nemissions, based upon that design, a r e shown in figure 1 Our analysis\n.\nindicated that the takeoff noise levels would be 4 EPNdB below the goal,\nthe sideline 6 EPNdB below, and the approach 9 EPNdB. This analysis\nindicated that the core would be the dominant noise source at each measurement position, with the fan contributing to the approach noise and the jet\ncontributing to the takeoff noise levels. Note that the goals a r e given in\nterms of aircraft flyover noise. The takeoff measurement point lies 3.5\nnautical miles down range from brake release with the aircraft flying\ndirectly overhead, The sideline measurement point also lies down range\non a takeoff but is displaced 1/4 of a nautical mile to the side and consists\nof a series of points in order to determine maximum noise level. The\napproach measurement point i s located under the landing flight path at a\npoint 1 nautical mile from the runway threshold. As the approach gli :,?\nslope i s defined as 3 O the altitude of the aircraft over the measuremt .\npoint i s 270 feet. Thus we had to consider aircraft performance in the\nengine design. For this we worked with the Beech Aircraft Co. to define\nthe characteristics of a twin engine QCGAT powered aircraft. With respect\nto noise, the rate of climb at takeoff, the power required at approach and\nthe geometry of the wing were determined. Airframe noise, however, was\nnot included in our noise estimates,\nThe design and performance of this aircraft plays an important part in the\nnoise emissions of the QCGAT engines. As has already been discussed,\nthe approach speed and takeoff performance can vary to meet the market\nrequirements ot the aircraft. For example, a lower approach power could\nhave been used that would have resulted in lower approach noise levels.\nAs the approach noise levels were predicted to be low, we felt that a small\npenalty was acceptable to reduce field length requirements. This ail1\nallow the aircraft to be certified for use at a large majority of the existing\nair fields in the United states.\nGas turbine engine noise source identification and control, figure 2, starts\nwith the engine and its geometric and performance characteristics from\nwhich prediction of its noise emissions can be made. The engine noise\nis subdivided into five distinct noise generating mechanisms. They a r e\nthe fan, compressor, combustionpprocess, power turbines, and the turbulent mixing of the exhaust jet with the ambient air. The majority of\n\nthe work done to advance the state-of-the-art gas turbine and aircraft\nnoise identification and prediction was, and is, being c a r r i e d out by NASA\nas part of their Aircraft Noise Prediction Procedures (ANOPP), References\n1 thru 5. This work has formed the basis of our noise prediction efforts.\nOf course, we have made certain modifications in o r d e r to more accurately\nreflect cur experiences.\nThese prediction procedures a r e continuously updatea to more accurately\npredict the engine noise levels. Given the aircraft performance and\napplying flight effects aircraft flyover noise can be calculated.\nENGINE DESIGN AND NOISE PREDICTION\nThe f i r s t task was to design a fan module for the engine. This involved\nseveral iterations to access the design alternatives. Fan noise reduction\nwas achieved through the use of a ldw p r e s s u r e ratio fan to reduce blade\nloading and noise generation. This has to be part of the fan design f r ,\ni t s conception. Other fan design features a s shown on figure 3, have \'\nbeen shown to recult in quieter fan designs for the large turbofan el?. nes\nSpecifical!y, the fan blade tip speed should be designed to be subsoni\nThus multiple pure tones, o r \'Buzz Saw Ncise" a r e eliminated altogethe-.\nThe design relative tip mach number for the QCGAT engine i s 1.13 which\nyields a subsonic value at all sea level operating points. The distance\nseparating the blades f r o m the exit guide vanes should be l a r g e when cornpared to the blade width to reduce rotor stator interaction noise that i s\nexpressed in fan broadband noise. We used a value of 2.3 for this ratio.\nThe ratio of fan vanes to blades was optimized at a value of 2.5. This wzs\nto e l i r ~ i n a t e\nwhat a r e known a s spinning modes that p r o ~ a g a t e the blade\nat\nIn addition, inlet guide vanes were not\npassing frequency fundamental.\nused in our fa= design. To h r t h e r insure that :nlet tcrbulence was reduced,\na long inlet duct was included i n the nacelle design. These features were\naccounted for i n our prediction of the fan noise levels. Our prediction\nalong with the core only to\nindicated that the fan would be a c o n t r i b u ~ o r\nthe approach power levels. By identifying the effect G the various a l t e r natives with the aid of our prediction procedures we were able to maintain\nthis balance to achieve a low- noise sigzature at approach.\nAn aircraft engine operates differently in flight than it does tied down to a\ntest stand. Its noise characteristics also change. In flight, the a i r inflow\ni s streamlined due to both flight cleanup affects of the forward a i r speed\nand the absence of ground turbulence that influence the generation of fan\nnoise, particularly the tone at the b?ade passing frequency. Forward\nflight however. has i t s greatest impact on the generation of jet noise\n(see figure 4). It acts to reduce the relative velocity between the exhaust\n\nand the ambient air, This can play an important part in the overall design\nof the engine aircraft system. F o r example, the airspeed at takeoff is in\npart determined by the length of runway availability. A longer takeoff roll\nrould permit a higher takeoff speed. Consequently, the same jet noise\nlevel and relative velocity could have been achieved using a higher exhaust\nvelocity.\nk s tk- aircraft flies past the observer, the soume -garic; in both time and\nspectral content. Dynamic amplification acts to increase the noise level\nas the ;kcraft approaches, and reduce the ncrise levels as it recedes. Then\nthere is the doppler effect that imparts a frequency shift to ths noise spectrum\nas the aircraft flies past, These phenomena must be accounted for to accurately predict the perceived noise of the aircraft.\nIt is the reduction in jet nsise that has the greatest potential for noise\nreduction,\nJet noise i s thus the second major element in the QCGAT engine design\nA high bypass fan design i s used to reduce the exhaust velocity and\ntherefore reduce the noise generated by :he turbulent mixing of a high\nvc-ocity jet, The jet noise predictions indicated the jet would contribute\nto the takeoff noise and possibly cause the aircraft engine combination to\nexceed the limits set by the QCGAT g o d s at the reduced thrust and altitude condition. The calculations showed that the differences between the\ncore engine and the fan exhaust gas velocities would contribute to t h s\nturbulent mixin;, noise (see figure 5).\nA six clement mixer was then designed to mix the core engine and fan\nexhaust gas co yield a single low velocity exhaust jet, The mixer, however,\nis not entirely free of side effects. P r e and post mixing turbulence can be\nan additional source of noise that has to be dealt with, These noise sources\ncan be reduced by the addition of a shroud. In our design we provided that\nshroud by extending the nacelle considerably past tF.e mixer to affect a Setter\nmix.\n\nThe high bypass fan and mixer were designed to reduce the jet noibe\ncomponent to a noise level below that of the core when forward flight\neffects cause reduction to occur in the jet noise. That leaves the core\nnoise component. Core noise means the noise generated by the combustion\nprocess. The ergine compressor and turbine noise were predicted to be\nabove the audible range. Their xroi-se sources do not contribute to the\nperczj -ed noise of the QCGAT eng:.u.: and were not considered in the design.\n\nCore noise models have, for the most part, been emperically derived.\nthe ANOPP routine was found to be adequate for our turboshaft engines.\nThis predicticn model u s e s combustor mass flow, temperature rise, and\npressure drop a s the basis for predicting core noise (see figure 6).\nEmperical data also suggest a 7 to 10 dB reduction for the turbof= version\nof this model. Core noise is now recognizcd a s a major source in turbofan\nengine noise and is the focus of much research. We a r e working on this\nboth in-housc and with NASA. However, we have not included any new coxe\nnoise control features, Some of the design modifications for emissions\nmay have contributed to higher core noise levels. As our prediction showed\nfrom the beginning, the core was going to be a significant contributor to the\nnoise characteristics of the aircraft. Consequently, we felt that further fan\nand j et noi sc reduct ion would have be en unwarranted.\n\nIt has been long recognized that the fan inlet and discharge ducts of the engine\nnacelle (see figure 7) offer ideal locations for the installation of sound treatment to absorb the noise generated by the fan, Absorptive material a r e\nparticularly efficient in absorbing sound energy in the high frequency region\nwhere niuch of the acoustical power radiated \'by the fan is concentrated.\nIn addition, the sound treatment can be constructed of flight worthy mate rials\nthat add little weight to t h e aircraft. Finally, the theory and experience of\ndesigning sound treatment panels a r e sufficiently sophisticated to accurately\npredict the results that will be achieved by a particular design. Consequently,\nfor the QcGAT engine nacelle to\nsound t reat ment panels we r e en~ployed\ndetermine the benefits that would be derived from their incorporation in an\naircraft design,\nThe sound attenuaticn requirements we r e Jete rmina-d by comparing the\npredicted noise levels with the QCGAT program goals. The approach\nposition represented the only point where the fan noise was predicted to\ncontribute to the aircraft noise levels. In addition, the frequency of the\nblade passing t o w at approdch is located in the more heavily weighted part\nof the audible spectrum. Consequently, the appioach power point was\nselected for the design of the sound treatment. At the other positions the\nfan does not contribute tothe aircraft noise levels. The Lockhecd California Company was contracted to design the sound treatment for the\nnacelle. Given the dimensional limitations the nacellc imposed upon the\nplacement of thc sound t reatmcnt and th2 cnginc operating parameters at\napproach, Lock. :w-ed pcncratcd a set of dcsign curvcs from which the\nsounc~\ntreatment -**asdesigned. Thcsc curves uvcrc based upon an analytical and emperically derived solution tc what a r e known a s the convected\nwave cquations Thc.sc. cquations dcscribc thc- sound gcncratcd by the fan\na s modcs of acoustic cncrgy rotating with and against the fan. This acoustic\ncncrgy can only propagate undcr certain boundary conditions. Thr* physical\ncharacti-ristics and operating parameters form these boundary conditions\n\nand determine which modes will propagate. Lockheed performed this\nanalysis and recommended a design. We then took this design to our\nNacelle contractor, Avco Ae rost ructure s, for fabrication.\nThe Lockheed design recommendations a r e shown in figure 8 Their design\n.\nwas for a single degree of freedom panel for both the inlet and dischargc\nducts. This design consists of a solid backing plate held 16 mm ( 5 1 8 in)\noff an inner plate perforated to a 57~\nopen area. A honeycomb cell structure material separates the inner and outer plates. The inlet panel is\n330 mrn (13 in. ) long to f i l l the available space in the inlet duct. The d i s charge sound treatment consists of a 45.7 mrn (18 in, ) long panel on the\nouter duct wall. The inner duct wall formed by the c o r e cowl was not\ntreated. The disch-rrge panel was terminated before the start of the mixer\nto simplify the d e s i g n Other wise the radiant heat f r c m the mixer would\nhave necessitated the selection of more expensive materials.\n\nThe predicted insertion loss for t k fan inlet sound treatment panel at the\napproach and takeoff points a r e shown in figure 9. The sound treatment\na s mentioned e a r l i e r was designed fcr the approach condition At this\npower setting the peak attenuation i s made to coincide with the blade passing frequency. The insertion loss is higher at the takeoff condition due to\nthe increase in a i r flow through the engine. The blade passing frequency\nat takeoff is also higher. The result is an attenuation approximately the\nsame as that for the approach condition.\n\nThe predicted attenuation for the fan discharge treatment a r e in figure 10.\nThe duct width between the inner and outer wall makes th2 treatment more\neffective even though the inner wall i s not treated.\nThe test nacelle and sound treatment panels were fabricated by Avco\nAerost mctures in Nashville, T e n n The test nacelle was designed without\nthe outer skin and to take insert panels in the fan inlet and discharge ducts\nwhere ordinarily the sound treatment would have been placed. Two s e t s of\ninserts were fabricated. Each was derigncd to be of one piece to ease\nremoval and installation during testing and to be rigid enovgh to maintain\nthe dzsired wall contours. The panels were of sandwich construction with\na honeycomb structure separating the inner and outer plates. The thickness\nof the honeycomb was determined by the Lockheed sound atten-lation requirements. One set was fabricated with a solid inner plate, and one set (see\nfigure 11) was fabricated with an inner plate perforated to achieve a Sff0 open\narea. This way we could test the engine with and uithout sound treatment in\nthe nacelle.\n\nThe small .ddius of the inlet and dischargc ducts limited to the dcpth of\nhoneycomb that could be used without warping the cell structure walls,\n\nPlugging the holes was also considered during design, The honeycomb\nmate rial selected used a small cell pattern in order to be flexible enough\nto take the curvature. This meant that there would be fewer holes per cell\nand more holes blocked by the cell walls as the honeycomb was laid over the\nperforated plate. Fortunately, we we re able to use an adhesive that\nmigrated up the cell walls and did not plug holes. The perforated plake was\n.\npunched to a 6% open a r e a When the honeycomb was then bonded to it,\nthe open area was reduced to 5%.\nThe program g o d s a r e given in t c r c s of aircraft flyover noise parameters\nExperience has shown that when the e ~ g i n e placed above the wing, the\nis\nwing serves as a barrier. A barrier attenuation routine was included in the\naircraft model to account for this affect. As shown in figure 12, the wing\ncreates a shadow zone that moves along with the aircraft. As only a small\nfraction of the noise i s refracted around the leading and trailing edges of the\nwing, the forward radiated f a n noise will not reach the ground as the shadow\nzone passes by.\nACOUSTIC TEST PHASE\nThe test phase took most of the month of August to complete, The g o d s of\nthe test program a r e shown in figure 13. They were to verify the noise\npredict;ons through comparison with measured data, determine the noise\nreduction of the mixer, and determine the effectiveness of the sound ttcatment panels,\nA test plan was prepared to accomplish these goals.\n\nThe normal method of\nrecording the noise emitted by the engine i s to record the sound pressure\nlevels at nineteen locations on an arc 100 feet from the engine. With the\nmicrophones located cverv 10 degrees, a full set of data over an a r c of\n180 degrees can be obtained, Four power settings corresponding to the\noperating envelope of the engine were used. In addition to the far field\nmicrophenes, acoustic probes were placed on the engine to aid in\nidentifying core and mixer components and the noise reduction of the sound\ntreatment, A barrier was also used during part of the testing to aid in\nisolating the fan inlet and discharge component sound levels.\nThree soparate engine configurations were used during the acoustic testing\nof the QCGAT engine. They arc a split flow exhaust nozzle configuration\ncalled the referee system, the hardwall nacelle in which the test nacelle,\nmixer, and hardwall fan inlet and discharge panels were used and the softwall nacelle in which the hardwall panels were replaced with the sound\ntreatment panels. Each configuration was tested to record the effect on\nengine noise at four power settings. T h e QCGAT engine was mounted in a\ntest frame and after a series of tc-sts in our test cells, it was moved to our\n\nfree field test site, This site is located close to the plant in an area free\nof most noise intrusions and where testing will not intrude into the local\nconnnunity.\n\nThe engine in tLe nacelle aad test frame were installed on a rotating test\nul\nstand. This stand is capable of rotating a f l 360 degrees, The normal\nmethod of testing is to record the noise of the engine on an arc 100 feet\nfrom the engine by five microphones placed 10 degree^ apart as shown on\nfigure 14. By rotating the engine and repeatiag the test p3iryts, a full\n180 degrees of m i s e can be oblzined with some overlapping points, The\nmicrophones at the 170 and 180 degree points were in exhaust stream and\nwere not used.\nPositions 5 and b indicate the orientation of the engine inlet during the\nbarrier test,\nOne-half inch condenser microphones fitted ai t h wind screens were placed\non the ground as used and recommended by NASA, This allows for a simple\n6 dB correction to be used when correcting the measured data to free field\nconditions for comparison with the predicted noise levels. The microphone\narray is shown in figure 15. The signal conditioning instrumentation a r e\nlocated in the acoustic data acquisition trailer where the data is recorded\non magnetic tape for later analysis,\nA sample of the engine performance data is given inTable L At each test\npoint, a complete set of engine performance data was recorded for use in\npredicting the engine static noise levels for comparison with the measured\nsound levels.\n\nThe ambient pressure, temperature, and relative humidity we re also\nrecorded.\n\nFan noise is composed of tones that are easy to identify near the axes of the\nengine, krt they blend together at the 90 degree locations, The purpose of\nthe barrier then was to isolate the fan inlet noise from the fan discharge\nnoise by physically placing a barrier between them. This was accomplished\nat the free field test site with the barrier shown on figure 16, The barrier\nf\nwas constructed o a fixed Fartition 14 feet high by 20 feet long and a movable\npartition through which the engine inlet protruded. This effectively removed\nthe fan discharge noise from the measurements of the fan inlet noise. By\nrotating the engine 40 degrees between measurements, data was recorded\nover an arc of 80 degrees. The movable partition was then pulled out and\nthe engine rotated 180 degrees so that the exhaust protruded through the\nbarrier when it was moved back into position. The fan discharge noise was\nthen recorded without fan inlet noise contributions. Both of these tests were\n\nrun at the same four power setting with the hardwall a d the softwall\nnacelles installed on the engine.\n\nThe locations of the engine mounted probes are shown on figure 17. Halfinch condenser microphones were located upstream and downstream of\nthe s c a d treatment to measure tbe noise reduction across the inlet sound\ntreatment panels, Semi-infinite wave guide probes supplied by NACA were\nused to sample the acoustic pressure levels in the primary engine exhaust\nand at the mixer exhaust plane, These probes consisted of 114 inch condenser microphone s in a sealed tube. A low volume flow of nitrogen at a\npressure just above that in the duct provided a gas seal to prevent hot\nexhaust gas from entering the tube where it could damage the microphone.\nThese probes were designed to record the acoustic pressure levels at the\nindicated probe locations. The recorded data will also be used in corerence\nanalysis to determine what part of the noise in the engine i s in fact radiGd\nout t o the different far field measurement locations.\nThe split \xc2\xa3low nozzle configuration with the semi -infinite wave guide probes\ninstalled in the primary exhaust nozzle a r e shown on f i g u ~ ~ This con18.\nfiguration was used to obtain baseline d ata for comparison with rnixer\nnoise levels,\nDATA ANALYSIS\nThe data recorded on magnetic tkpe %-as then analyzed. Reducing, organizing, and cataloging all this data was a time consuming task. The audysis\nwas straight forward. During the individual tcst runs, the engine performance was monitored and the relevant ambient and operating parameters\nrecorded, Using these data and the appropristc cycle sheet data, we could\npredict the expected sound pressure levels. These were then col.:pared\npoint by ?aint, frequency by frequency, and angle by angle with the measured\nsound pressure levels. In this manner, we estimated the contribution of\neach component to the overall noise lcvels at each power setting. The\npredictions were then adjust-d to reflect this conlparison, and the correlation was run again. W also evalcated the insertion loss due to the sound\ne\ntreatment and determined the mixer noise reduction.\nWith the appropriate flight corrections and aircraft performance estimates,\nwe were ready to estimate the flyover noise levels. The individual compoaent contirbution to the overall noise levels were determined on a\nspectrum basis as shown on fi-wre 19. This plot consists of the one-third\noctave band sound pressure lcvels over a frequency range from 25 Hz to\n20,000 Hz. The procedure for dcriving the flyover noise levels only\nconsiders the sound pressure levels from 50 Hz to 10,000 Hz. The prc-\n\ndicted f a n noise contribution was overlaid, The calculations correctly\nlocsted the bla-!e passing tone, its harrilonics and the broadband component.\nThe magnitude of the blade passing tone fundamental however was underpredicted. Next, the predicted jet noise component was added as shown\non figure 20. As was expected, the jet component does not contribute\ndirectly to t5e noise levels at the low power setting when the predicted\ncore noise component is added to the noise spectrum as shown on fwre 2 .\n1\nThe predicted spectra matches the measured spectral shape. The agreement\nhowever i s only fair in the mid-frequency region at the blade passing tone\nfundamental. This same analy sis was carried out for the softwall and split\nflow configuration. The analysis was also carried out at each power setting.\nThe high power setting is shown on figure 22. Note that the agreement is\nonly fair across the mid and high frequency regions of the spectrum, The\nlow frequency part of the spectra appear to be in close agreement. Here\nthe jet noise corr.ponent is predicted to be the predominant source. Based\nupon this comparison and similar ones at other power seeings and configurations, u-e concluded that the jet noise prediction routine is adequate\nfor the QCGAT program. Consequently, the predicted jet noise levels could\nbe analytically removed from the measured data. The remaining noise\nlevels would then be that composed of the core and fan components. Once\nthe jet component had been removed thd sound power levels attributed to\nthe core were then compared with the predicted core sound power levels\nas shown in figure 23. Also plotted a r e the sound power levels derived\nfrom ihe acoustic probes located in the primary exhaust. The probe data\na r e shoWzmore a s a confirmation of the slope rather thanthe sound power\nlevels correctly calculated. These data indicate that the core noise model\nunderpredicts the core noise level by roughly 3 dB. This underprediction\nappears to be indepelldent of the power setting of the engine. A simple\n3 dB correction factor was the ref0 re applied to the core noise prediction\nprocedures. After making this refinement to the core noise model, the\npredicted-to-measured correlation was then rerun. Figure 24 shows that\ncomparison. The spectral agreement between the measured and predicted\ndata is good over the frequency range of interest. Note that the sound\nlevels in the band containing the tone at blade passing a r e also in good\nagreement. This indicates that the core noise contributes across the\nspectrum. The dominance of the core noiso can be seen in figure 25. The\nnoise levels in the discharge quadrant a r e dominated Ey the core component\nto the extent that the fan component is almost entirely masked. The core\nnoise component i s present in the forward quadrant. The reduction in the\nfan noise levels by the sound treatment was hard to discern for this reason.\nWhen the core noise component is removed from the one-third octave band\ncontaining the blade passing tone, and the resulting blade passing tone is\nplotted against the ar.gle from the inlet, a s shown on figure 26, a fan tone\ndirectivity plot is formed. The predicted sound pressure levels at the peak\nangles are also shown for the inlet and discharge quadrants. The expected\n\nresults with the barrier in place come from the prediction procedures,\nOnly when the barrier is in place will the measured data approach these\nlines which it does as can be seen by the dotted lines. This plot shows\nh~ the fan noise contributes to the foxward and aft radiated engine noise\nlevels, If an observer were to move past this plot as indicated, the noise\nlevels experienced would first rise and then fall off as the observer moved\npast. Once past the engine, the noise levels would then rise again as the\ndischarge fan noise reached the observer. This is roughly how the static\ndata was converted to observed flight sound levels. At the high power\nsetting (figure 27) the core noise obscures the aft fan tone from the analysis.\nA small adjustment was made to the fan noise model from which these data\nwere derived. This adjustment had to do with the effect of relative tip design\nmach number. With this adjustment, we concluded from the agreement shown\nhere and on the previous figure that the fan noise model is accurately computing the fan noise levels. The sharp dip at the 60 degree point is due to\nthe fact that the data from 0 to 40 degrees were recorded at slightly different\npower settings than the data from 50 to 90 degrees, The predicted data\nshows this same dip, We feel this i s an artifact of the data acquisition\nprocess and i s not a characteristic of the fan noise, The individual component contributions appear to be adequakly predicted once the noted\ncorrections have been made. Figure 28 shows a final comparison of the\nmeasured and predicted overall sound power levels. This plot was\ngenerated to verify the accuracy of the prediction techniques for the static\ncase before proceeding to the flyover analysis. The agreement shown here\nindicates to us that the updated noise prediction model accurately reflects\nthe static noise emissions of the QCGAT engine,\nAs noted earlier, it was difficult to discern the noise reduction of the\nsound treatment panels from the far field data. Figure 29 shows the\nose-third octave band sound pressure levels at the upstream and downstream micropho.?e locations in the inlet. Here the acoustic energy i s\npropagating against the air flow in the inlet duct. The upstream microphone\nthen recorded the inlet noise after it had passed through the treated part\nof the inlet duct. Figure 30 shows that the expected insertion loss and\nthe insertion loss derived from the test data, These are the values that\nwill be used inthe flyover noise estimates. Figure 31 shows that the\nexpected and estimated insertion loss for the fan discharge duct sound\ntreatment panels. The discharge panels had no provision for microphones\nand were unable to discern a noise reduction from the far field data due\nto the presence of the core noise. We have assumed that the treatment i s\nfunctioning properly. The estimated values for the discharge sound treatment panels are shown here.\nThe jet noise Icvels were predicted to be low due to the use of a high bypass ratio fan. Figure 32 shows the difference between the noise spectra\n\nof such an engine fitted with the split flow nozzle configuration and with\nthe mixer nacelle configuration. The shaded area represents the static\nnoise reduction of the mixer. Above 250 hertz, the core noise source\nstarts to mask the jet noise and above 1000 hertz, the fan i s dominant.\nWhen flight effects are *dded, both the mixed and split flow jet components\nwill drop leaving the mixed flow jet noise levels below the core noise levels.\nThe split flow noise levels would drop and be roughly equal in magnitude\nto static jet noise levels.\nThe procedures employed (figure 33) in the QCGAT program to assess the\nnois* emissions of a QCGAT powered aircraft are the Federal Aviation\nAdministration\'s certification procedures for turbojet powered aircraft\n(Reference 6 ) . This is a very rigorous method. Basically, the F A\nA\nrequirements call for measuring the aircraft noise every hslf second as\nthe aircraft flies over the measurement point. For this analysis, predicted data was substituted for the actual ne asurements. Thq demonstration engine performance a d the Beech aircra\xc2\xa3t design were u s - \' to\ntest point performances. These data were ,- a\ncompute the i~dividual\nentered into the prediction procedures. The appropriate flight and wing\nshielding effects were then applied to the individual component noise\npredictions. The aircraft noise signature was then derived by combining\nthese into a table of aircraft noise. Then by analytically moving the aircraft noise table past the measurement point, the time history of the\nflyover could be constructed for each half-second interval. These sound\nlevzls were then used to compute the tone corrected perceived noise\nlevels for the flyover event. The maximum tone-corrected perceived\nnoise levels was then feud along with the time the aircraft noise i s\nwithin 10 PNdB of the maximum. From these data, the effective perceived\nnoise level is calculated.\nFigure 34 shows the tone corrected perceived noise levels versus time for\nthe approach flyaver. The maximum tone-corrected perceived noise level,\nlabeled PNLTM occurs after the aircraft ha.s passed directly overhead.\nThe time the PNLT was within 10 PNdB of the value i s 8.5 seconds. This\nplot also shows that the fan inlet ard discharge noise a r e heard at separate\ntimes. The valley between the peaks is caused by the lower sound le~.rels\ngene rated at the sideline positions. Wing snieldinb, the shaded portion,\nacts to cut the inlet peak off early and makes this valley deeper. The core\nnoise component i s heard after the aircraft is past as most of the core\nnoise is in the aft quadrant of the engine. Because of the duration correction, the fan component noise levels are higher and contribute more to the\neffective perceived noise levels. Figure 35 is the same type of plot showint the takeoff flyover tone-corrected perceived noise level time history.\nHere the time the noise i s within 10 PNdB of the max is much longer. At\n\nthe approach condition, the altitude at flyover is 370 feet. F o r the takeo f condition, it is 2600 feet. Consequently, the time will be considerably\nf\nlonger. The maximum tone-corrected perceived noise level also occurs\nmuch l a t e r a s the sound requires longer to I aach the observer and because\nthe dominant noise sources a r e the core and jet. These components\nradiate most of their acoustic energy in t). r e a r quadrants and, a s such,\na r e not heard until the aircraft is past tht? observer. Also shown here\na r e the higher noise levels of a split flow nozzle configured aircraft.\nHere the jet component contributes more\nthe aircraft noise levels\nboth in magnitude and duration, The dura..ion i s increased because the\njet noise peaks farther aft than does the core noise. This means that\nthe peak noise occurs l a t e r in the flyover. Thus, the addition of the\nmixer not only reduces the aircraft flyover noise levels, the aircraft\nnoise does not linger as long.\n\nCONCLUSION\nF o r an aircraft powered by two Avco Lycoming QCGAT engines installed\nin a nacelle that includes a mixer and fan inlet and discharge sound treatment panels and mounted over the wings, the effective perceived noise\nlevels for the takeoff, sideline, and approach conditions will be 68.4,\n7.06, and 77.3 EPNdB, respectively, These noise levels shown in\nfigure 36, are below the limits set by the QCGAT program goals. In the\nanalysis, the effect of several alternative engine configurations on the\naircraft noise was assessed. F o r example, removal of the sound treatment panels would add 2 EPNdB to the approach noise levels and still be\nbelow the QCGAT goals. The other positions would not he affected.\nThe noise levels shown here a r e for the engine that was tested kid\ndelivered to NASA\nWhen the iterations a r e completed for this engine\ndesign, the increased thrust of the engine will mean that the aircraft will\nachieve an altitude of 3600 feet over the takeoff point versus the present\n2600 feet. This upill result in a 3 EPNdB reduction in the takeoff noise\nlevels and a 1 EPNdB reduction in the sideline noise levels. In this case,\nthe split flour exhaust nozzle configuration would be within 1 EPNdB of the\nQCGAT goals, Figure 37 shows the Avco Lycoming QCGAT engine\neffective perceived noise levels plotted against thAcFederal Aviation\nAdmiriistration\'s Stage III noise standards and the high technology that\nused by NASA for the QCGAT program goals. This demonstrates\nthat the technology that has worked for the large engine can be\ntransferred to the general aviation size engine. Consequently,\nturbofan engine noise emissions should not be a constraint to the\ngrowth of the general aviation market.\nIn summary, (see figure 38) large turbofan noise control technology was\nsuccessfully applied to a general aviation size engine. The stringent\nprogram goals set by NASA forced a design that required the use of a\n\n.\n\ndesign that required the use of a quiet fan and integration of the nacelle\nand aircraft in the engine design. This demonstrates that the QCGAT\nprogram goals can be met with the latest noise control techniques without incurring a pe rforrnance penalty.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Stone, J.

For t h e f a r tern, o w choice of f;lel is\nkel-nsene-based commercial jet f u e l , which suggests t h e lrse of a s t r a t i f i e d\ncharge combustion system (Table 2).\nA parallel can be drawn between t h e use of J e t f u e l i n an advanced,\nspark-igniticn z i r c r a f t piston engice and t h e increased ~ r o d u c t i o nof d i e s e l\nengine powered cars.

A s i n t h e case of \',he dieselpowered c a r where diesel f u e l i s widely a v a i l a b l e because of t h e e x i s t i n g\nd i s t r i b u t i o n system f o r long haul trucking, jet f u e l is becoming more v i d e l y\na v a i l a b l e due t o t h e increased use of jet-povered busir.ess and commuter\nairplaues.\n\n\'Ihe a v a i l a b i l i t y of t v o f u e l s suggested t h a t our s t u a should address\nt h e p o s s i b i l i t y C \' two advanced engines r a t h e r than one. The two engines\nI\nw e have chosen v e v i l l c a l l moderate r i s k technology and high r i s k technology\nr\nengines.

S h o k ~i n Figure 2, on t h e l e f t , is\na standard cmbustion chamber usea o r nearly a l l a i r c r a f t p i s t o n engines.\nThe comb-istion chamber volume i s hemispherical i n shape, w i t h one i n t a k e\nn\nvalve, m e ex9aust valve and two spark plugs per cylinder. O t h e r i g h t is\nt h e combustion chamber we are proposing f o r both t h e moderate r i s k and high\nr i s k technology engines. I n t h e case of t h e moderate r i s k technology engine,\nt h e combustion system v i l l use a lov ;;ressure f\'uel i n j e c t i o n system where\ngasoline is indected i n t h e intake manifold J u s t zpstream of t h e intake valve.\nThe hi&- r i s k technology s t r a t i f i e d charge system w i l l i n j e c t j e t f u e l a t\nhigh pressure d i r e c t l y i c t o t h e combustion chwber J u s t before t h e piston\nreecnes t o p dead center.\nThis combustion chmber ve have c a l l e d t h e HTCC, o r high turbulence\ncombustion chamber. Ttlrough t h e use of s w i r l and high turbulence, it permits\nt h e c a b u s t i o n of lcbn mixtures of f u e l and air a t high compression r a t i o s\n\nwithout t h e detonation vhich limits t h e campression r a t i o of t h e standard\nengine. With t h e HTCC conrbustion chamber, we have recently demonstrated t h e\ndetonation- free operation of a homogeneous charge, 6-cylinder engine a t a\ncompression r a t i o of 12:1 compsred t o a compression r a t i o of 8.5:1 f o r a standard engine. This increase i n compression r a t i o had t h e e f f e c t of impmVin&\nf u e l economy at c r u i s e paxers by 7 percent.\n\nAmong t h e various means of extracting paver from t h e waste exhaust\ngases of an i n t e r n a l combustion engine a r e turbocharging and turbocompounding. I n a a i r c r a f t piston engine, turbocharging serves two purposes. F i r s t ,\nn\nit is a means of extracting greater pwer f r o m a given engine displacement,\nand second it is possible t o maintain tk:at paver from s e a level t o high\na l t i t u d e s . Turbocharging is a common practice i n t h e a i r c r a f t piston engine\nindustry. I n 1979, about 65% of a l l a i r c r a f t engines manufactured by\nTeledyne Continent a1 Motors w i l l be turbocharged.\n\nFor our advanced engines ve a r e proposing t h e use of turbocompounding\ni n addition t o turbocharging. The schematic i n Figure 3, shows one method\nof employing turbocoerpounding. The exhaust gases leave t h e engine, "E?, and\npass first through a power turbine Ti, vhich transmits p e r back i n t o t h e\nengine crankshaft through a speed reduction unit. The exhaust gases then\ncarry t h e i r remaining energy t o a turbocharger. T e advantages of turboh\nc olc pounding are t h a t it is possible t o extract one horsepower f o r every\npound of weight added, and t h e combination of turbocharging plus turbocompounding i s more e f f i c i e n t thac turbocharging alone.\nAlthough turbocompounding i s not a novel idea i n i t s application t o\na i r c r a f t piston engines, turbocompounding does c o n s i t i t u t e advanced technology\nof t h e basis t h a t we w i l l be atterapting t o apply it t o a n engine of only 350\nhorsepower, compared t o the 3000 horsepower of t h e Wright engine and t h e\nNapier Nomad of t h e post- World War I1 era.\n\nENCZNE OPERATIONAL SYS-S\nW see f o r t h e f u t i r ~ significant impact on our i n h t r y by t h e\ne\na\nwork t h a t i s now going on i n t h e f i e l d of automotive e l e c t m l i c s . There i s\nno doubt that the auto industry represents t h e greatest potential f o r f a r\nterm growth f o r the electronics industry. Partly responsible f o r t h i s\ngrowth i s the development of inexpensive and r e l i a b l e signal transducers\nand t h e development of sophisticated electronic control system s t r a t e g i e s .\ne\nFor both t h e moderate r i s k and hi&% r i s k technology engines w see\nt h e adaptation of all engine operational systems t o electronic control.\nThis rne;~nsthat t h e present three levers now i n use t o control engine speed,\nmanif~ld\npressure and fuel flow w i l l be combined i n t o a single lever by which\n\nthe p i l o t controls power,\n\nThe t r i c k is t o be able t o accolpplish t h i s task\nso thak t h e systems exhibit fail-soft behavior. This lsesns t h a t a mechanical\nbackup a p t e m v i l l be required.\n\nI n vicv o f t h e increasing coarplexity of our air t r a f f i c control system\nand the increasing cuaount of single-pilot IFR W a g , t h e extent t:, uhich ve\ncan reduce p i l o t workload impinges d i r e c t l y on safety of f l i g h t . T a b l e 3\nlists those operational systems uhich w i l l be converted t o electronic control\nand the benefits derived fa each.\nrm\n\nWe examined many d i f f e r e n t engine configurations and reduced our\nchoices t o t h e t h r e e shown i n Figure 4. A s f a r as cooling i s concerned, our\nconclusions f o r these t h r e e configurations and an engine o f 350 horsepower,\nvas t h a t l i q u i d cooling provides no d i s t i n c t advantage i n e i t h e r weight o r\ncost over air cooling. In fact, uhen considering t h e added systems required\nfor l i q u i d cooling, a c e r t a i n additional risk is involved, Since all engines\nare ultiaately air-cooled, and because of t h e l a v temperature d i f f e r e n t i a l s\npresent v i t h liquid cooling, t h e placement of a r a d i a t o r large enough t o\nremnre t h e rejected heat would pose a problem i n t h e already compact design\nof an airplane f o r vhich t h i s s i z e engine i s intended.\nOnly one of these configurations looked promising compared t o t h e\nhorizontally-opposed, six-cylinder design w e ultimately chose, and t h a t was\nt h e inverted V-8.\nThe V-8 engine would be =re vibration-free than t h e\nhorizontally-opposed s i x , but from a cost a d maintainability standpoint,\nsix-cylinders are preferable. The r a d i a l design was rejected because of i t s\nl a r g e f r o n t a l area.\n\nADVMCEf) MATERIALS\n\nThe use of advanced materials was considered from t h e standpoint of\nweight reduction and increased durability. Table 4 compares three engines\nwhere t h e velght of each is divided up among t h e materials it contains. The\nf i r s t engine is a TSIO-550 engine representing t h e present l e v e l of technology.\nIt contains 8 lbs. of miscellaneous materials such as p l a s t i c , rubber and\ncopper, 332 l b s of s t e e l , and 245 lbs. of aluminum, f o r a t o t a l weight of 585\nlbs. Our moderate r i s k technology engine contains only 253 Ibs. of s t e e l and\n215 lbs of aluminum while we have added 10 lbs of advanced materials t o r\na t o t a l weight of 485 lbs., which i s a weight reduction of 17%over t h e\npresent engine, The reduction i n use of s t e e l and aluminum i n t h i s engine\nis brought about primarily by t h e more judicious use of these materials.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIn t h e high r i s k technology engine we =e w i n g only 80 lbs. of s t e e l ,\nprimarily i n t h e crankshaft, reduction gears, cylinders and exhaust valves.\nThe use of aluminum has been reduced somewhat and a t o t a l of 119 lbs. of\nadvanced materials a r e used f o r an engine weight of 405 lbs , a 31% improve-\n\n.\n\nment over t h e present dey engine. I n t h i s engine t h e greatest part o f t h c\nadvanced material weight is titanium, with a small m u n t of reinforced\np l a s t i c and ceramics.\nTitanium is one of t h e most abundant metals t o be found on earth.\nWhile titanium is not a rare metal, it is very costly t o produce. The\none spot,\nproblem being t h a t it i s not u s u a l l y found i n great quantity i n\nbut i t \' s p r e t t y much evenly distributed over t h e earth. Another problem is\nt h a t it takes 1 3 times as much energy t o produce a pound of titanium iroln\nore as it does t o make a pound of s t e e l . What we a r e counting on here i s\nan advancement i n titanium production and metallurgy which would permit an\noverall savings i n energy consumption t o be realized. The question i s whether\nt h e fuel saved by reducing t h e weight o f t h e engine by 31% will be overcme\nby the energy used t o produce t h e titanium i n t h e first place.\nENGINE SPECIPICATIOlO\nMany of t h e d e t a i l s of t h e design study have been omitted f o r t h e sake\no e\nof brevity, but Table 5 shows comparison of s m of t h e specifications of\nt h e three engines we have discussed. All t h r e e are six-cylinder, horizontallyopposed. The current technology engine has a displacement of 550 cubic inches,\nwith 420 cubic inches f o r t h e moderate and high r i s k technology designs. All\nthree a r e rated a t 350 HIP and can cruise at 25,000 feet at 250 BHP. A t t h i s\ncruise parer t h e brake specific fuel consumptions a r e ,446, .358 and .331,\nrespectively. The service ceilings of our advanced engines a r e increased t o\n32,000 f e e t compared t o 35,000 feet f o r t h e present engine.\n\nWe\'ve already discussed t h e i n s t a l l e d weight and type of fuel.\nThe TBO, or time between overhaul, f o r our current technology engine\ni s 1400 hours, which we have increased t o 2000 hours f o r t h e advanced engine.\n\nTo get an idea of the f u e l econow improvements which were made, compare\nThe current technology\nengine dumps the equivalent of 3l9 HP out t h e exhaust a t maximum cruise power.\nFor t h e moderate r i s k technology engine t h i s l o s s has been reduced by 33%t o\n214 HP, and by 51% t o only 156 HP f o r t h e high r i s k technology engine.\n\nt h e power wasted i n t h e exhaust of the three engines.\n\nIMPROVED AIRPLAlUE PERFORMANCE\n\nWell, what does a l l t h i s bw- us? It\'s not enough t o consider only\nW must look a t the bottom l i n e . That\ne\ni s , what benefits do we see when t h e engine i s i n s t a l l e d i n an airplane?\n\nt h e improvements i n t h e engine.\n\nBut here a r e\nsome preliminary results based on t h e i n s t a l l a t i o n of the three engines i n\na current technology single-engine airframe.\nW a r e not quite finished with t h i s part of our study.\ne\n\nWhat we\'ve done here i n Figure 5 is t o simulate t h e i n s t a l l a t i o n o f all\nthree engines i n an identical airdesigned f o r a chosen arbitrary\nmission p r o f i l e f o r t h e high r i s k technology engine. W chose a range of\ne\n1000 nautical miles v i t h 45 dnutes fbel i n reserve, a cruise a l t i t u d e of\n25,000 f e e t at 250 horsepwer vhich corresponds t o maximum cruise p w r for\no e\nall three engines, The resulting calculgtions shaw t h a t t h e present technology\nengine vould have a raage of only 518 nautical miles and t h e mo&erate risk\ntechnology engine, 814 nautical miles,\nA r e l a t i v e efficiency was calculated f o r all t h r e e cases based on the\npayload each airplane could carry, multiplied by its speed and divided by its\nfuel consuenptim. The efficiency factor w a s then normalized t o t h e value of\n1.00 for t h e present technology engine. Based on this factor, t h e relative\nefficiency of t h e moderate r i s k technology engine v a s increased by 32% and\nt h a t of the h i e r i s k technology engine by 49%. O f course, these factors\nvill change depending upon t h e mission profile selected.\nA similar analysis w a s done f o r the case of atwin-errgine airplane\n(Figure 6), with similar results. In t h i s case t h e mission p r o f i l e was set\na t 1300 nautical miles f o r t h e high r i s k technology twin. The results show\nnormalized r e l a t i v e efficiencies of 1.00, 1-37 acd 1.57, respectively.\n\nFigure 7 shows t h e top, side and r e a r external viers of an advanced\nengine, pointing out some of the important features. Both t h e moderate\nr i s k and high r i s k technology engines w i l l appear sq&stantially the same,\nexternally.\nCompared t o present engines, t h e gear-driven propeller s h a f t has been\nextended somewhat t o accommodate a more streamlined cwling. The exhaust\nsystem is designed f o r good pulse recovery t o enhance t h e paver recovery o f\nt h e turbocompounding power turbine. The speed reduction system From t h e\npower tcrbine t o t h e crankshaft i s a lasvytis t r a c t i o n drive which was\nchosen over a gear reduction drive because of its potential for damping\ntorsional vibrations and i t s l i g h t e r weight. The engine a l s o includes an\nintegral o i l sump/oil cooler t o save weight and volume,\nIn order t o achieve a compact design, the exhaust system is on t o p of\nthe engine rather than on t h e bottom.

Brouwers\nGeneral Products Division\nTeledyne Contimtal Motors\n\nThis design study reintroduces the d i e s e l engine as an a i r c r a f t powerplant.\nA methodical design study was conducted t o a r r i v e a t new d i e s e l engine conf i g u r a t i o n s and applicable advanced technologies. ILo engines a r e discussed\nand t h e d e s c r i p t i o n of each engine includes concept dravings. A performance\nanalysis, stress and weight prediction, and a c o s t study were a l s o conducted.\nThis information w a s then applied t o two a i r p l a n e concepts, a six-place M a\nand a four-place s i n g l e engine a i r c r a f t . The a i r c r a f t study consisted of ins t a l l a t i o n drawings, computer generated performance d a t a , a i r c r a f t operating\nc o s t s and drawings of the r e s u l t i n g airplanes. The performance d a t a s h w s a\nv a s t improvement over c u r r e n t gasoline-pwered a i r c r a f t . A t the ctnnpletion of\nt h i s basic study, t h e program was expanded t o evaluate a t h i r d engine configuthe b e s t f e a t u r e s of the o r i g i n a l two,\nr a t i o n . This t h i r d engine i ~ c o r p o r a t e s\nand its design is c u r r e n t l y i n progress. Preliminary information on t h i s engine\nis presented.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEncrgy conservation, u n c e r t a i n t i e s of f u e l supply and limited a v a i l a b i l i t y\nof high octane gasoline, have renewed the i n t e r e s t i n t h e d i e s e l a i r c r a f t engine,\nsince its f u e l economy i s b e t t e r than any type of a i r c r a f t engine c u r r e n t l y i n\nproduct ion.\nA i r c r a f t d i e s e l engines have been developed before, notably the Junkers\nf\n"JUMO",\nthe Napier "NOMAD" and t h e McCulloch TRAD 4180. O these, only t h e\nJunkers opposed piston, 2-stroke cycle engine ever reached the production stage.\nThe Napier Nomad was a 2-stroke cycle, turbocompounded design. Its complexity\nand t h e f a c t t h a t i t invaded the t e r r i t o r y of turbine engines probably accounted\nf o r i t s demise. The McCulloch engine came c l o s e t o f l y i n g when t h e program was\nterminated f o r non-technical reasons.\n\nNew technologies, now under a c t i v e development, w i l l r e s u l t i n even b e t t e r\nf u e l economies than can be obtained with current state-of-the-art\nd i e s e l engines.\nThese technologies a l s o make i t possible t o develop a powerplant which is more\ncompact and l i g h t e r than current gasoline a i r c r a f t engines.\nTuo engines were investigated i n the study, a 298 kW (400 HP) d i e s e l f o r a\ntwin engined a i r p l a n e and a 149 kW (200 HP) d i e s e l f o r a s i n g l e engined a i r c r a f t .\n\n\\\n\nC\nThe study consisted of three major phases:\n\n1. Technology Analysis.\n\nA survey of available aviation and automotive sources was conducted\nto identify new developments which offer potential benefits to an\naircraft engine. These technologies were ranked and then evaluated\non the basis of performance and adaptability.\n2 Engine Concept Design.\n.\nThe technologies which were chosen as a result of the evaluation and\nranking process were applied to the design of the 149 and 298 kW\nengines. Performance, stress, weight, and cost calculations were made\nconcurrently.\n\n3 EnginefAircraft Integration Study\n.\n\n.\n\nThe results of Step 2 were then used in an engine-aircraft integration\nstudy to determine the performance improvement of an airplane equipped\nwith these diesel engines.\nSome of the technologies which were applied in these engine designs are\nanticipated to be available in the late 1980\'s.\nThese technologies result in\nhigh level of performance and, although advanced, are not untried. The adiabatic\nengine, the catalytic combustor, and the high speed alternator envisioned are\ncurrently under development under various contracts. It should be noted here\nthat, although the concept engine proposes the use of ceramic combustion system\ncomponents, the use of such materials for "man-rated" aircraft may be 20 years\naway. These concepts were included primarily to shov what may be ultimately\npossiblz. However, alternate less advanced solutions are also given which will\nresult in a small reduction of performance when compared to the ultimate; but\nnevertheless will result in a powerplant which far outperforms the current\ngasoline aircraft\n\n.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAdvantages of the Diesel Engine\nThe diesel engine has always been burdened with the stigma of being heavy,\nthus offsetting its advantage of low fuel consumption for aircraft applications.\nIf it is possible to build an engine that combines low fuel consumption and low\nweight, then that engine becomes a very attractive aircraft powerplant. Old and\nonce discarded concepts can become attractive by applying new technologies.\n\nA conventional diesel er~ginerequires high compression ratios for starting\nand low load operation. This results in high firing pressures at full load when\nin fact the engine could run adequately at a much lower compression ratios. New\n\ntechnologies make i t possible t o combine good s t a - r t a b i l i t y with lov f i r i n g\npressures a t f u l l load. This study shows t h a t t h e weight of t h e d i e s e l can be\nreduced below t h a t of c u r r e n t gasoline a i r c r a f t engines.\nThe d i e s e l engine o f f e r s other advantages i n a d d i t i o n t o low f u e l\nconsumption, i.e. :\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n\nLower operating c o s t .\n- Lover c o s t of f u e l\n- Reduced maintenance\n- Extended TBO\nGreatly reduced f i r e and explosion hazard.\nBetter i n - f l i g h t r e l i a b i l i t y .

Seven of t h e t h i r t e e n engines\no\nhave a r a d i a l configuration, seven w e r e a i r c o o l e d , e i g h t were 2-stroke cycle.\nThe t a b u l a t i o n becomes more meaningful i f specific. r a t i o s a r e used.\nTable 11.\nSome observations can be made from these t a b l e s .\nvalues are:\n4-Stroke cycle engines\n2-Stroke cycle engines\nAircooled engines\nLiquid-cooled engines\n\n.710\n.926\n.783\n.923\n\nSee\n\nAverage s p e c i f i c weight\n\nkW/Kg\nkW/Kg\nkW/Kg\nkW/Kg\n\n\' f i e numbers i n d i c a t e t h a t a 2-stroke c y c l e engine can be expected t o be\nl i g h t e r than a 4-stroke cycle engine. A comparison of aircooled and l i q u i d\ncooled engines would seem t o favor t h e liquid-cooled engine. However, t h e\nengine weights of liquid-cooled engines tabulated do not include t h e weight of\nt h e cooling package. With t h i s modification, the corrected values then becose:\nAircooled engines\nLiquid-cooled engines\n\n.78 3 kW/Kg\n,805 kW/Kg\n\nNew Engine Design Study\n\n- 298 kW\n\nEngine\n\n-\n\nIn addition to considering the historical background of aircraft diesel\nengines, a literature search was made and a technology base was established to\nevalute any concepts that may be considered for an all new engine design.\nThe follwing criteria were observed in considering any new ideas:\nThe engine must be a pistonfcrankshaft type powerplant.\nBe compatible with conventionally designed aircraft (size and arag).\nnilow manufacture of an experimental model in five years.\nBe ready for production in the late 1980\'s.\nM ?P+ 1979 EPA Emission Standards (guide-ref erence only)\nHave multi-fuel capability.\nHave engine performance comparable to current aircraft engine.\nHave lower BSFC than present engines.\nMaximum specific weights of .852 KgIkW for the 298 kW and 1.095\nKg/kW for the 149 kW engine.\nLife cycle costs equal or less than present aircraft engines.\nAvoid problem areas encountered in current aircraft engine designs.\n\n.\n\nDesign attributes that had to be considered included:\nPerformance, weight, size, C. G., fuel economy, reliability, multi-fuel\ncapability, noise, life cycle cost, component costs, and technology required.\nFigure 1 is a flow chart that shows the different possible combinations\nof design features that were considered and evaluated within the frame work\noutlined above.\n\nA detailed description of each of these features is beyond the scope of this\npaper, but was included in the original basic study. The evaluation then resulted in the technologies that follow from Figure 1 by taking the high score items\nalong the "common to all versions" and "radial 2-stroke cycle" lines.\nCommon to All\nVersions Line\n\nRadial 2-S troke\nCycle Line\n\nOpen Chamber\nCeramic Pistons\nInsulated Exhaust Manifolds\nNo Cylinder Cooling\nTool Steel Piston Rings\nComposite Connecting Rods\nSynthetic Lube Oil\nHigh Pressure Fuel Injection\nElectronic Controls\nConventional Oil Filter\n\nIndividual Cylinders\nLow Compression Ratio\nGeared Prop Drive\n!.oop Scavenge\nIndependent Turbo Loop\nCatalytic Combustor\n\nConventional Fuel F i l t e r\nPendulum Damper\nThe engine concept was then l a i d o u t around these features.\nFigure 2 s h w s an a r t i s t rendering of the proposed 298 k 6-cylinder engine.\nW\nFigure 3 shows t h e schematic of t h i s engine. The design incorporates t h e\ntechnologies which were defined before.\nThe chosen system uses t h e C u r t i s loop scavenging. The i n t a k e p o r t s and\nintake manifold a r e located a t t h e p r o p e l l e r s i d e of t h e engine, exhaust p o r t s\nand exhaust manifold a t t h e back end.\nThe cylinder l i n e r and p i s t o n top are ceramics and, t h e r e f o r e , c y l i n d e r\ncooling w i l l not be required. Tool steel p i s t o n r i n g s w i l l be required. Cooling air w i l l be used only f o r t h e a f t e r c o o l e r , o i l cooler, and t h e f u e l i n j e c t o r s .\nThe exhaust p o r t s w i l l be o i l cooled.\nEach cylinder receives f u e l from a s e p a r a t e i n j e c t i o n pump located i n f r o n t\nof t h e cylinder (cool s i d e of t h e engine). F a i l u r e of one pump s t i l l leaves 516\nof engine paver available. A high i n j e c t i o n l i n e pressure w i l l be required t o\nlimit i n j e c t i o n duration a t high engine speeds.\nThe turbocharger can run independent of t h e engine. For t h a t pilrpose a high\nspeed s t a r t e r / a l t e r n a t o r and an o i l pump a r e mounted on t h e turbocharger. A\ntwo-way valve i s placed i n t h e i n t a k e manifold. To s t a r t t h e engine, t h i s valve\nis i n t h e v e r t i c a l p o s i t i o n of t h e schematic, which r e s u l t s i n a turbocharger loop\nindependent of t h e engine. Combustor f u e l is i g n i t e d by t h e heater. This h e a t e r\ncan be turned off a s soon a s t h e c a t a l y s t becomes s u f f i c i e n t l y hot. The cycle\nw i l l become self-sustaining a t approximately 1 / 3 of t h e maximum turbo speed, and\nt h e s t a r t e r now runs a s an a l t e r n a t o r . Hot, high pressure a i r w i l l flow t o t h e\nengine when t h e two-way valve i s partia1l.y opened. The cylinder i n t a k e p o r t s a r e\nopened during approximately 120 craxrk-degrees, s o hot a i r can flaw through two\nc y l i n d e r s f o r preheating on cold days. The high pressure a i r w i l l next be\nadmitted t o the engine mounted bleed a i r s t a r t e r t o crank t h e engine. The whole\nsequence would be automatic.\nThis system o f f e r s many advantages:\n1.\n\nThe a v a i l a b i l i t y of hot induction a i r a t s t a r t reduces the need f o r a\nhigh compression r a t i o . The engine w i l l s t a r t and i d l e a t a 10:l\ncompression r a t i o provided t h i s hot, high pressure a i r i s a v a i l a b l e\nt o i t during cranking. Thus, with t h i s low compression r a t i o , t h e\nf i r i n g pressures a r e held down t o 9650 kPa (1400 psig) a t f u l l load\nr e s u l t i n g i n low engine weight.\n\n2.\n\nThe engine w i l l s t a r t e a s i l y under cold conditions, a problem with\ncurrent engines.\n\n3.\n\nHot s t a r t problems a r e eliminated.\n\n4.\n\nThe engine can be -hut-off and t h e turbocharger kept running when t h e\na i r c r a f t i s on t h e ground f o r some period. Meanwhile, e l e c t r i c p w e r ,\ncabin h e a t o r a i r conditioning remain available. This i n e f f e c t\nconverts t h e turbocharger i n t o an APU.\n\n5.\n\nThe b a t t e r y requirement is g r e a t l y reduced s i n c e engine cranking is\naccomplished by a i r pressure.\n\nThe use of s y n t h e t i c o i l is required i n t h i s engine design due t o t h e h o t\ncylinders. The s y n t h e t i c o i l can take higher temperatures and requires fever\nchanges than conventional petroleum bases o i l s . Over t h e long term perhaps a\nmethod can be found t o generate an a i r f i l m between pistons and cylinder walls,\ni n e f f e c t , using a i r bearing technology. This would a l s o reduce t h e expected\nr e l a t i v e l y high o i l consumption which is inherent t o 2-stroke cycle engines.\nThe engine design concept is shown i n Figures 4 through 8. The c y l i n d e r s\na r e arranged i n two o f f s e t banks of t h r e e c y l i n d e r s each, a c t i n g on a s i n g l e\ncrankpin. The r o t a t i n g and r e c i p r o c a t i n g i n e r t i a s are 100%balanced by coumerweights on t h e crank cheeks. The pendulum dampers a r e mounted t o t h e counterweights and w i l l be tuned f o r t h e 4-1/2 and 6th orders. The c y l i n d e r s a r e uncooled and provided with ceramic l i n e r s . The i n t a k e p o r t s and the i n t a k e mif o l d a r e located a t t h e f r o n t s i d e - t h e cool s i d e of t h e engine. The exhaust\np o r t s and exhaust manifolds a r e located a t t h e backside - t h e hot s i d e of the\nengine. Two exhaust manifolds a r e required t o prevent t h e exhaust pulse of one\n-vlinder t o i n t e r f e r e with t h e scavenging of t h e previous cylinder i n t h e f i r i n g\ns\ntlence. The piston tops a r e ceramic.\nThe s n a l l end of t h e connecting rods i s designed t o allow f r e e r o t a t i o n of\nt h e piston. This should reduce t h e wear r a t e of t h e p i s t o n rings. The b i g end\nof t h e connecting rods is designed a s a s l i p p e r , i.e., each rod contacts only\n113 of the circumference of t h e crankpin. This i s possible f o r 2-stroke cycle\nengines because t h e combined load of gas pressure and i n e r t i a s i s always d i r e c t ed toward the crankpin. The bearing m a t e r i a l w i l l i n i t i a l l y be conventional,\nbut a study could be conducted l a t e r of s e l f - l u b r i c a t i n g and gas bearings t o\neliminate t h e need f o o i l i n t h e crankcase.\n~\nImmediately i n f r o n t of t h e f i r s t main bearing a r e 6 individual i n j e c t i o n\npumps, operated by a s i n g l e lobed cam ring. Individual pumps were chosen t o\nimprove engine r e a l i a b i l i t y - f a i l u r e of one pump s t i l l leave 5 cylinders\noperable.

Operating c o s t\nestimates were made using f i g u r e s obtained from c u r r e n t e s t i m a t e s of average\noperating costs.\nThe a c q u i s i t t o n c o s t estimates were based on information from the a i r p l a n e\ns y n t h e s i s process. The a i r p l a n e empty weights v e r e t h e main parameters used v i t h\nFY79 r a t e s f o r labor, m a t e r i a l c o s t s , and OPI engine costs. The estimating\nmethods used a r e based on h i s t o r i c a l d a t a and "learning curve" theory. An a i r frame weight was estimated from the operating empty weight. This w a s used with\nestimating d a t a t o get m a t e r i a l weights t o which m a t e r i a l c o s t could be applied.\nManhnur per pound data were used t o get labor content t o which labor rates were\n\napplied. A productten run of 600 units was used.to amortize a s s 4 development\ncosts and to locate facrors on the learning curves. When a basic factory cost\nwas swmned up, assumed ~anufacturer\'s and dealer\'s mark-ups vere applied. Costs\nwere included for currently typical optional equipment a d avionics selections.\nT e final total represented a dealer\'s price tag figure for a typically equipped\nh\nairplane. Both the single and the twin were considered to be all neu designs.\nThe same sets of reasonably realistic assumptions vere used throughout so the\nresults are quite adequate for looking at differences between gasoline and diesel\nairplane prices within the overall accuracy of this study. Acquisition price\npercentage changes from the diesel to the gasoline engine pavered airplanes is\nshown on the cost srpaaries. See Tables IX and X for the twin and single engine\nairplanes, respectively.\nThe columns headed "gasoline" refer to the airplanes for equivalent size to\nthe diesels but with the iaission capability as indicated in the performance\nestimates. The "equal plane performance gasoline" column refers to the airplanes\nthat will do the same missions as the diesels but are bigger and less efficient.\nThe cost suaary tables s h w the considerable overall cost advantages of\nthe diesel powered airplanes. Gasoline airplanes of equivalent size cost less\ninitially but this advantage is not sufficient in view of the reduced mission\ncapability and higher overall costs. The biggest factors in raising the gasoline\nairplanes operating costs are fuel and overhaul expense, as indicated.\nPropeller Noise Estimates\nPropeller performance estimates were made to get some idea of the propeller\nsizes needed to realize a cruise propulsive efficiency of -85 for both the twin\nand single engine airplanes. These calculations indicated that a two-blade, 84\ninch diameter, constant speed propeller will vurk for the single engine airplane.\nThe propellers indicated for the twin are 81 inch three-blade. Estimates of\n1000 ft. flyover noise predict valstes of 72 dB(A) for the single and 74 OB(A) for\nthe twin. These compare favorably to the limits of 77.5 dB(A), respectively.\nLimits are based on airplane weight as set out in FAR 36, Appendix F.

During t h e mid-601s period, two prototype S t r a t i f i e d Charge Rotary Engines were designed, b u i l t and developed\nthrough t h e e a r l y o p e r a t i o n a l test s t a n d s t a g e ( r e f . 1). The RC2-60U10 ( f i g u r e\n1) w a s 3 liquid-cooled two r o t o r v e h i c u l a r engine i n t h e 160\n200 HP class\nand the RC2-90 ( f i g u r e 2) an a i r cooled 300 HP h e l i c o p t e r drone engiite. The\ntrochoid dimensions of these engines was t h e same as t h e 1958-designed 60 cubic\ni n c h s i n g l e r o t o r engine ( t h e RC1-60), but t h e r o t o r width was increased 50%\nf o r the RC2-90.\nBoth engines proved t h e i r multi-fuel c a p a b i l i t i e s , but n e i t h e r\ncould match t h e f u e l economy of our carbureted RC2-60U5 automotive prototype\nengine of t h e same e r a , which was comparable t o e x i s t i n g automotive engines\n( r e f . 2). Furthermore, the RC2-60U10 performed w e l l a t t h e lower powers and\nspeeds, with shortcomings apparent a t the other end of t h e o p e r a t i n g regime,\nwhereas the 90 cubic inch combustion configuration was subsequently developed\nt o meet high power goals, only t o show low end d e f i c i e n c i e s . I n both cases,\nhowever, t h e engines showed s u f f i c i e n t t e c h n i c a l promise f o r t h e i r s p e c i f i c\ndesigned a p p l i c a t i o n s , but a s a r e s u l t of changes i n m i l i t a r y planning, t h e\nintended uses did not m a t e r i a l i z e and development was shelved.\n\n-\n\nAlthough thermal e f f i c i e n c y equal t o our homogeneous charge R o t a r i e s was\nnever demonstrated with t h e s e engines, t h e inherent c o m p a t i b i l i t y of the Rotary\ngeometry with u n t h r o t t l e d and d i r e c t chamber i n j e c t e d S t r a t i f i e d Charge combust i o n ied some t o b e l i e v e t h a t t h e p o t e n t i a l f o r s u p e r i o r performance had t o be\nthere. Figure 3 i l l u s t r a t e s how t h e Rotary provides t h e required r e p e t i t i v e\nscheduled turbulence, without l o s s e s , while d i r e c t chamber i n j e c t e d reciproc a t i n g engines have t o generate t h e required v e l o c i t y g r a d i e n t s a t a c o s t of\n\nboth volumetric and mechanical efficiency, f u r t h e r widening the s p e c i f i c power\nadvantage of the Rotary.\nFollowing t h e f u e l c r i s e s of 1973, R&D e f f o r t s were r e i n i t i a t e d in an\nattempt t o resolve whether o r not t h i s higher e f f i c i e n c y p o t e n t i a l r e a l l y existed. This time, our f e a s i b i l i t y t r i a l s were directed towards automotive applic a t i o n s which peaat not only vide power and speed range f l e x i b i l i t y with f u e l\neconomy, but lw o r c o n t r o l l a b l e m i s s i o n s as w e l l . Since hydrocarbon emissions\na t t h e very lw speeds and povers t y p i c a l of an automotive operating regime had\nproved t h e -st d i f f i c u l t a r e a f o r the homogeneous charge Rotary, new configurat i o n s were screened on t h e b a s i s of road-load brake s p e c i f i c f u e l consumption\n(BSFC) and brake s p e c i f i c hydrocarbons (BSHC). The 1973 attempt t o combine the\nbest f e a t u r e s of RC2-60U10 and f i n a l RC2-90 i n j e c t i o d i g n i t ion designs i n t o a\ns i n g l e configuration which could run f u l l range was successful and, f o r the\nf i r s t time, achieved b e t t e r f u e l consumption, on a v a r i e t y of f u e l s , than the\ngasoline carbureted engine. This design improvement led to, i n 1974, a -re\nf l e x i b l e arrangement whereby a separate p i l o t nozzle, with r e l a t i v e l y small f u e l\nf l w , is used t o t r i g g e r combustion. This design, shown i n f i g u r e 4, uses a\nmulti-hole main nozzle, located close t o the trochoid surface t o modulate f u e l\nf l w i n response t o power demand.\nA number of v a r i a t i o n s of t h i s basic approach were tested during the 1975\nand 1976 periods of increased R&D a c t i v i t y and t h e r e s u l t s showed t h a t the\nlocalized and controlled combustion could produce low "raw" hydrocarbons. The\ntest findings did indicate, however, t h a t increased r o t o r combustion pocket\ntemperatures were required. I n t h i s case, these temperatures were achieved by\nuse of an a i r - g a p insulated s u r f a c e p l a t e attached t o t h e r o t o r combustion face.\nThe r e s u l t s , f o r two successive 8.5:i compression r a t i o hot r o t o r designs\n( f i g u r e 5) show t h a t the best of these w a s a b l e t o match the shaded area which\nrepresents modern automotive engine untreated HC levels. These data a l s o i l l u s t r a t e t h a t t h e r e s u l t s were s i m i l a r f o r the d i f f e r e n t f u e l s tested. Although\nBSFC vs. BMEP a l s o showed r e l a t i v e l y small d i f f e r e n c e s with these f u e l s t h e r e\nwas no s i g n i f i c a n t reduction of BSFC with the increased r o t o r temperatures used\nt o reduce BSHC.\n\nThis e a r l y t e s t work indicated t h a t f u r t h e r HC reductions a r e possible with\nmoderate i n t a k e t h r o t t l i n g a t the very low power/speed end of the regime and by\nan increase of compression r a t i o . Accordingly, the f i r s t t e s t on the RC1-60\ns i n c e i n t e r r u p t i o n of the automotive-directed a c t i v i t y between e a r l y 1977 and\nt h e present, is now being run with a 10:l compression r a t i o rotor. Since t h i s\ncompression r a t i o increase w i l l a l s o improve SFC, it is germane to look a t the\ncomparative trends. The test evaluation, which s t a r t e d i n October, has not yet\ncompletely covered the nozzle-matching and i n j e c t i o n dynamics s o r t i n g out process. Preliminary data, presented on an Indicated b a s i s i n f i g u r e 6, shows some\npromise; however, gain on a brake basis w i l l be s l i g h t l y less as a r e s u l t of\nsome f r i c t i o n increase.\n\nThe 1976 s p e c i f i c f u e l consumption baseline curves (8.5:l compression r a t i o )\na r e shown i n f i g u r e s 7 and 8. Figure 7 compares r e s u l t s , f o r the same designs\nt h a t demonstrated low hydrocarbons, t o data which a r e representative f o r f u l l sized European automobiles powered by Diesel engines.

The advanced spark-ignition p i s t o n\nengine study, which i s 75 percent complete, shows 0.33 and 0.36 BSFC f o r t h e\ns t r a t i f i e d charge and lean burn concepts, respectively.

A Curtiss-Wright program confirmed t h z t\nefficiency improvements i n the RC2-75 could be achieved by increasing\ncompression r a t i o and r e l o c a t i n g spark plugs: t h e BSFC a t c r u i s e was improved\nfrom 0.54 o r i g i n a l l y t o 0.47.\nThe U n i v e r s i t y o f Michigan, working under a NASA grant, recently completed\nf e a s i b i 1it y t e s t s o f a diesel ized current-production spark i g n i t i o n c y l inder.\nThese t e s t s indicated t h a t moderate f i r i n g pressures a t low compression r a t i o\nresulted i n improved c r u i s e BSFC, thus i n d i c a t i n g the p o s s i b i l i t y f o r\nconziderably reducing t h e s p e c i f i c weight o f a diesel.\nI n conclusion, t h e r e s u l t s o f the near-term conventional engine a c t i v i t i e s\nhave shown t h a t i t may soon be possible t o improve both economy and cooling\nefficiency.\nSince t h e technology i s being developed i n terms o f current\nprod~ction\nengines under t h e constraint o f remaining compatible w i t h e x i s t i n g\nf a c i l i t i e s , processes, etc., i t can be incorporated i n t o OEM production w i t h\nl i t t l e adverse e f f e c t .

K e i t e r\nMcCauley Aaessory O i v i s h\nCcssna Aircraft Company\n\nStudies have indicated that Zhe application of advanced technologies to\nGeneral Aviation propellers c i a reduce fuel consumption in future aircraft an\naverage of 10 percent, meeting current FAR Part 36 noise limits. Through the\nuse of composite blade construction, up to 25 percent propeller weigh: reduction can be achieved. This weight reduction in addition to 7 percent propeller\nefficiencv improvements through application of advanced technologies result in\n4 percent reduction in direct operating wsts, 10 percent reduction in aircraft\nacquisition cost, and 7 percent lower gross weight for General Aviation\naircraft.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIn order to insure that USA built General Aviation aircraft reaain\ncompetitive and dominant in the world market place, support energy conservation\nneeds, and meet the more stringent environmental controls, NASA sponsored\nprograms are necessary to isprove propeller technology based for the most part\non that developed during the World War XI era. Attention to the area of\nmaterials used and fabrication methods is the conerstone leading to the\npursuit of advanced technology concepts and sophisticated computer analysis\ntools to evaluate those concepts.\nPreliminary indications are that proper techniques could be developed\nwith the utilization of composite mzterials in the structure of propeller\nassemblies. A proper blend of design and fabrication techniques will result in\nsignificant weight and cost reductions, enhanced safety through improved\nfatigce life, greater adaptability to a variety of design concepts and less\ncapital requirements to produce propellers suitable to the General Aviation\nmarket.\nn e use of lighter weight blades will permit both the increase in blade\nretention hardware safety margiiis and the reduction in weight and complexity\nof such hardware.\nThe combination of improverents in cost and weight reduction, fatigue\nlife increases, more consistently produced airfoil sections, and more widely\nvaried potential design selection has a significantly broadening effect on\ntypical installation compromises which will be apparent as the potential impact\nof the various advanced technologies are enumerated in later sections of this\npaper.\n\niYRECEOiilG PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\nIt will be shown that significant propeller weight improvements are\npossible for current propeller/engine/aircraft installations while\nachieving improveaents in performance and reduced noise, both within the\naircraft and in the airport environment.\n\nThe potential propeller weight reductions and efficiency improvements can\ndirectly result in reductions in aircraft fuel consumption, direct operating\ncosts, acquisition cost, and lower gross weight.\nIaprovements in propeller fatigue safety margins would permit corresponding increases in overhaul life, provide greater tolerance for field mainteriance\nor lack of same and thus increase safety, productivity, and economy.\nThe currer~tresearch program awarded to kCauley is needed to structure\na realistic and effective technology plan for General Aviation propellers, to\nidentify the advanced technologies and their potential costs and benefits, and\nto determine and identify areas of key technical risks and required research\n)\nprograms (Figure 1. It is hoped that once the areas of greatest potential are\nidentified, NASA research funding can then be channeled into the most appropriste areas. The team comprising the current study effort (contract number\nNAS3-21719) is highlighted in Figure 2.\nSENSITIVITY STUDIES\nSensitivity studies were perforated to evaluate the potential of each\ntechnology element on propeller performance, noise, weight, and cost for the\nfollowing two categories of General Aviation aircraft:\n\nI. Low speed (up to 250 knots)/low power (up to 350 HP) , 2 - 8 place.\nsingle and twin engine, currently powered by reciprocating engines.\n11. High speed (up to 400 knots)/high power (up to 650 HP) , 6\ntwin engine, turboprop.\n\n-\n\n18 place,\n\nIn order to evaluate the improvement potential for the various technology\nelements, specific aircraft satisfying the characteristics outlined above for\neach category were chosen. The representative aircraft, illustrated in Figure\n3, chosen for each aircraft category, are as follows:\nCategory I\n\n:\n\nCessna 172N\nCessna 21a1\nCessna 414A\n\nCategory I1\n\n:\n\nCessna 331\n\nTECHNOLOGY ELEMENTS INVESTIGATED\n\nTechnology elements were considered with the potential for improving\nairplane/mission characteristics such as fuel burned, direct operating cost,\nacquisition cost, and gross weight. The original scope of technology elements\nconsidered were screened to include any element felt to have any potential\nwhatsoever based on McCauley experience, other\'s experience, and available\nliterature. Each technology element was first evaluated in terms of its\neffect on propeller criteria of merit including performance, noise, weight,\ncost, and structural considerations. The total impact of the technology\nelements affecting performance and weight were then investigated to determine\ntheir impact on airplane/mission characteristics. The General Aviation\npropeller concept incorporating the appropriate advanced technologies is\nillustrated in Figure 4.\nPERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS\nThe following list of technology elements show potential for performance\nimprovements. The element is specified along with the loss to be minimized.\nkeeping in mind the practical limitations of each of the technology elements\nand their impact on other important propeller criteria of merit such as noise,\nweight, and structure.\nTechnology Element\nDesi~noptimization\nDecreased power loading\nIncreased number of blades\nMaintain tip speed\nDecreased activity factor\nUse of proplets\nUse of sweep (helical tip mach\nnumber reduction)\nAdvanced technoloey airfoil type\nDecreased thickness ratio\nImproved propeller/nacelle\nintegration\nImproved surface finish\nMaintainability of airfoil shape\n\nPerformance Loss\nTo Be Minimized\nAxial momentum\nTip\nroetn\nAxial r r m n u l\nProfile\nTip\n\nReference\ndtilized\n1\n1\n1\n2\nPurdue Univ.\n\nCompressibility\nCompressibility, profile\nProfjle\nBlade profile, nacelle drag\nProfile\nProfi1e\n\n7\n\n4\n2\n23\n.\n5,6,7\n7\n\nThe advanced technology concept of swee? is unique since it both improves\nperformance and reduces noise. The predicted effect of sweep on performance\nand noise is shown in Figure 5 . Sweep is structure limited with 25-30 degrees\nprobably feasible for future General Aviation applications. The effect of\nsweep in addition to the effect of other significant advanced technology elements on cruise performance gains are shown in Figure 6. Power loading,\nnumber of biades, tip speed, activity factor, and proplets are grouped\n\ntogether and classified as design optimization parameters. Maintainability of\nairfoil shape is not included since it is a parameter to prevent degradation\nthrough the use of composites and not to improve current technology.\nACOUSTIC CONSIDERATIONS\nThe primary technology elements affecting aco~stics\nare number of blades,\ntip speed, thickness ratio, activity factor, sweep, blade loading, advanced\ntechnology airfoils, and proplets.\nThe following is a list of these primary technology elements:\nTechnology Element\nDesign Optimization\nIncreased number of blades\nDecreased tip speed\nDecreased activity factor\nUse of proplets\nPeak blade loading moved inboard\nUse of sweep (helical tip mach number\nreduction)\nAdvanced technology airfoil types\nDecreased thickness ratio\n\nReferences Utilized\n8\n\nPurdue University\n8\n\n8\n\nAs with performance considerations, several elements are grouped together\nunder design optimization. From the acoustic standpoint, all items other than\nadvanced airfoils, sweep, and reduced thickness ratio are considered design\noptimization variables. The main technology elements affecting acoustics,\n.\nincluding sweep whose effects were isolated earlier, are shown in Figure 7\nThese gains can be realized without any noticeable loss in performance. The\ndelta d ( ) improvements possible are in many cases more than that required to\nBA\nmeet noise regulations. During design tradeoff studies, the relative\nimportance of each design parameter must be evaluated. Greater noise reductions could be obtained if one were willing to sacrifice performance.\n\nMATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nIn order to reliably meet the future performance and acoustic requirements of General Aviation propellers with weight reduction and approaching\nprice competitiveness with aluminum, consideration of composite materials\nrequires appropriate attention as a viable solution. Advanced filamentary\ncomposite materials combine low densities and low notch sensitivity with high\nstrengths and stiffnesses. Adequate safety margins of current propellers can\nbe further enhanced. Figure 8 outlines the advantages of composites and their\nassociated propeller benefits. Because filamentary materials are only strong\nin the filament direction, careful consideration must be given to ply\n\norientation to match the design requirements.\nThrough variations in the composite matrix, blade sections can be tailored\nto meet the specific radial stiffness distribution required. The shape of\nprimary bending and torsional modes can be altered effectively through the use\nof composites. Reductions in blade section size permissible with composites\nwill result in higher blade deflections than are customary with aluminum.\nBlade aeroelastic instabilities can result from large out of plane deflections\nand must be given careful consideration.\nAppropriate blade materials, type of hub retention system, methods of\nconstruction for composite materials, and material consideration for blade\nleading edge erosion resistant strips are all areas which must be addressed in\ndetail.\nSTRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nIn evaluating the structural ifitegrity of advanced technology propellers,\nconsiderable attention must be given to the steady and alternating loadings\nexperienced in service. The steady loads consist primarily of centrifugal,\nbending due to thrust loading, and torsion. The alternating vibratory loads\nare due to blade aerodynamic excitations and alternating torsional input due\nto reciprocating engine cylinder firing sequence and frequency. Aerodynamic\ninflow angles excite ixP alternating loads which are primarily evident on\nturboprop installations being overshadowed by engine alternating torsionals in\nreciprocating installations. In all installations one should assure that 1xP\nresonance does not occur in the normal operating RPbl range.\nIt is a relatively easy job to evaluate the steady loads on a propeller\nblade using conventional techniques. To determine the vibratory effects,\nhowever, with incorporation of advanced technologies such as sweep and proplets,\nmay require the use of three dimensional finite element analysis rather than\ntwo dimensional beam analysis or lumped parameter matrix manipulation techniques currently utilized. With regard to vibratory analysis, available\nanalytical techniques applicable to General Aviation propellers determine mode\nfrequencies with good accuracy and vibratory loads and resultant stresses\nwithin 25-30 percent on turbine installations. The effect of alternating\ntorsionals from reciprocating engines is currently not included in existing\nmodels. Experimental testing of strain gaged propellers is still relied upon\nheavily. Experience and experimental data will dictate allowable alternating\nstress levels with composites as is the case kith aluminum alloys.\nUsing the torsional mode results from three dimensional finite element\nanalysis (3-D FEA), the possibilities of stall flutter can be addressed. The\nstall flutter parameter is based on static torsional frequency, and semichord,\nvelocity, and mach number at the SO percent blade radius location. Through\nextensive experimental pl-cgrams,a stall flutter boundary has been determined\nfor conventional blade shapes. A similar boundary must be determined for blade\nshapes incorporating the advanced technology concepts outlined in Figure 4.\n\nS t a l l f l u t t e r occurs under conditions of blade angle o f a t t a c k and inflow\nv e l o c i t y where a major portion of t h e blade is s t a l l e d . S t a l l f l u t t e r\no s c i l l a t i o n s occur a t t h e first t o r s i o n a l mode when t h e spanwise damping\ni n t e g r a t i o n along a blade becomes zero o r less. The cocditions conducive t o\ns t a l l f l u t t e r a r e during s t a t i c , takeoff, and r e v e r s e t h r u s t operation.\n\nBy using t h e bending and t o r s i o n a l mode d a t a from 3-D FEA and customarily\npresented i n terms of a Campbell diagram, c l a s s i c a l f l u t t e r can be addressed.\nC l a s s i c a l f l u t t e r can occur a t high a i r c r a f t v e l o c i t i e s where t h e mod2 spacirig\nover t.he operating RPM range is i n s u f f i e n t and a coupling o f t o r s i o n a l and\nbending modes occur (reference 9)\n\n.\n\nBecause o f t h e limited composite f a t i g u e s t r e n g t h d a t a a v a i l a b l e and t h e\nlack of a n a l y t i c a l techniques t o predict v i b r a t o r y loads, t h e evaluation of\nf a t i g u e l i f e is highly q u a l i t a t i v e .

This same process\noccurred many years ago t o e s t a b l i s h t h e current baselines u t i l i z e d f o r\naluminum.\n\nBLADE WEIGHT, COST, AND AIRCRAFT MISSION CONSIDERATIONS\nPreliminary screening of candidate m a t e r i a l s i n d i c a t e s configurations of\nE-Glass, S-Glass, Kevlar, and Craphite with medium and high d e n s i t y epoxy c o r e s\nt o meet t h e mean load, a l t e r n a t i n g load, f a t i g u e , and weight requirements o f\nGenerxl Aviation ~ r - p e l l e r s .

This\ndoes not take i n t o account t h e blade r e t e n t i o n area. Also, i n order t o\nachleve a desired compromise of advanced technologies between performance and\nnuise, t h e p o t e n t i a l weight savings may be reduced. In o t h e r words, t h e\ntrends of decreased power loading through diameter increases, increased nmber\nof blades, sweep, and p r o p l e t s w i l l tend t o increase weight while being o i f s e t\nthrough lower blade a c t i - ~ i t y a c t o r s and lower thickness r a t i o s ( f e a s i b l e\nf\nbecause of composites).\n\nThe performance gains indicated e a r l i e r i n addition t o weight reductions\npossible through t h e use of composites have a d i r e c t e f f e c t on a i r c r a f t /\nmission c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s such a s f u e l burned, operating c o s t , a c q u i s i t i o n c o s t ,\nand gross weight.

Studies also indicate average potential aircraft gross\nweight reductions of seven percent.\nFUTURE RECOWENDATIONS\nIt is apparent from the sensitivity studies performed on the various\ntechnology elements that NASA funding directed primarily into the areas of\ncomposite materials research, and the advanced technology concepts outlined in\nthis paper can provide the data base required to achieve the stated airplane/\nmiss ion improvements.\nSince many technology elements improving performance have an adverse\neffect on acoustics and future government regulations controlling noise limits\nwill probably be more stringent, it is imperative that research funding be\nexpended in this area. 171is should include careful evaluation of current\nmethodology of propeller noise prediction techniques and the unification into\na common, recognized procedure for utilization by the General Aviation\ncommunity. Experimental verification of resulting theories through wind tunnel\ntesting and flight substantiation is necessary.\nThrough the use of composites, some of the more promising technology\nrequirements will become possible such as thickness ratio reductions, sweep,\nlower activity factors, reduced power loading, more blades, advanced airfoils\nwith complex curvature, smoother airfoil surface, and maintainability of airfoil shape in service. These factors lead to optimized designs meeting\nappropriate strength requirements. At a certain blade load level, the\ncomposite blade will deflect more. This can lead to aeroelastic instabilities\nwhich is an important area requiring NASA support. Although considerable\nresearch has taken place in the composite materials area, the product applications have not included propellers. The aircraft propeller is one of the most\ncritically stressed aircraft components. It operates in a severe environment\nand is a major structural component with complex stress distribution. It is\nexposed to the wide range of variables created by power plants in a most\nintimate manner. The successful use of composite materials in General Aviation\npropellers will provide information on fatigue to establish limit lines of\nmean stress versus alternating stress for lo5 and 108 cycles as typically\nrepresented on a Goodman diagram. Such information is not readily obtainable\nin any other application.\nNASA sponsored research will help fill the gap in the application of\ncomposite technology (design and fabrication methods) between current applications and their potential use with propellers. Advanced composites technology\nhas progressed to a point where reliable application as aircraft secondary\nstructure is accepted and the application for primary structure is relatively\nclose but the confidence level for commercial application has not been\nestablished. It is, therefor,:, highly desirable and appropriate to explore\n\nthis General Aviation application.\nSpecifically, the total cost of composite blades must be nearly competitive with aluminum blades in order to experience wide use in General Aviation.\nResearch into low cost fabrication techniques is the key to achieving cost\ncompetitiveness. Wind tunnel testing with follow-on programs for flight test\nverification is necessary.\nIn the advanced airfoil design area, NASA has continually made efforts in\nimproving communication with the General Aviation community over the past five\nyears through workshops, symposiums, conferences, etc., and from these have\ncome airfoil design implementation schedules satisfying the needs of wing\ndesigners. What is needed now is an airfoil technology plan to design airfoils\nspecifically tailored for the widely varying fluid flow conditions which\nprevail along a propeller blade.\nThe area of propeller/nacelle integration is already receiving some\nattention by NASA with Grant NSG1402 to Mississipi State University. The\nfirst phase involving the collection of baseline data in the NASA-Langley full\nscale tunnel is just getting underway. Current program calls for investigation\nof nacelle shapes characteristic of those used in twin reciprocating engine\ninstallations. There should be future testing including a wide variety of\npropeller/nacellc configurations covering the broad range of aircraft/engine\ncombinations tnisal of the General Aviation fleet.\nNASA has supported analytical studies to provide special purpose user\noriented programs to calculate propeller inflow velocity fields, steady and\nunsteady aerodynamic loads and mode shapes and frequencies. The next step\nshould be to concentrate on analytical procedures to predict the vibrational\nloads and stresses the propeller is subjected to in service. The model must\ninclude the coupling effects of the propeller-engine system. Accuracy of\nexisting prediction techniques is not acceptable except for 1xP analysis.\nHigher order stresses malent with reciprocating engine installations are\nnot predicted with adequate accuracy. A good, reliable prediction technique\nwhich exists prior to vibration survey\nwould eliminate much of the uncertai~:~\ncertification testing. Wasted time and cost associated with experimental testing of a configuration exceeding vibratory load limits could be nearly\neliminated\nA\n\n.\n\nWith the very competitive market in General Aviation which lir,~its\nfunds\nin research and development, it is very evident that NASA sponsored support\nis necessary to enhance the state of the art in the areas mentioned above.\nThe key areas requiring future research enumerated above are highlighted in\nFigure 13.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe study of a wide range of propeller design variables and advanced\ntechnologies has indicated that the potential exists for propeller performance\nimprovements and weight reductions meeting consistently more stringent\nregulatory noise levels. Advanced technological development of propellers has\n\na direct impact on the fuel burned, direct operating costs, acquisition cost,\nand gross weight of General Aviation aircraft. NASA can assure that these\ngoals are met by allocating appropriate funds in the areas where the greatest\npotential exists.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

I have already mentioned the\nsignificant difference with intended airspeed range. Coupled with this is\noperating altitude; the higher the Mach, the higher the altitude. Typically\npropellers are operated in cruise at maximum efficiency which translates\ninto lower power loadings. This generally works out well for low speed\naircraft which end up being sized for climb conditions. As design Mach\nis increased, the propeller becomes sized by cruise and selecting a power\nloading for peak efficiency would result in very large diameters. So, some\nefficiency is sacrificed for size and a higher power loading is selected.\nThe blade count is increased to maintain high cruise efficiency levels and\ngood low speed performance as well. The rpm\'s are similar but Prop-Fan\nfavors the lower side to minimize the transonic effects as airspeed is\nincreased.\nIn both aerodynamics and acoustics, it is necessary to design for operation\n~ . fa large portion of the rotor area in the transonic regime. 800 fps at\n0 2 Elach results in a tip helical Mach of 1.14. The key to maximizing\n.\nie-dynamic efficiency is to eliminate compressibi!ity losses and this is\ndone by using the thinnest airfoils possible, consistent with structural\nintegrity. Blade sweep is used in a manner similar to wing sweep to reduce\nthe effective Mach number the airfoil section operates at. Nacelle shaping\nis accomplished to reduce the velocity through the disk with the primary\nemphasis to controlling inboard root choke, Area ruling is used in\nconjunction with nacelle shape to minimize drag losses in the root where\nthe solidity is high. Lastly, an advanced airfoil shape may allow thicker\nairfoils or less sweep by raisi~gthe section critical Mach number above\nthe point where compressibility losses rise rapidly. Three generations of\nmodel Prop-Fans have been designed, fabricated, and tested. Advanced\naerodynamic analyses have been developed from existing propeller and fan\nex,pertise and applied to the design tasks. The aero analysis treats the\ninboard blade area as a cascade like a turbofan and the outboard area like\na propeller. Only compressible 2D airfoil data are used. Both the effects\nof the nacelle and blade sweep are accounted for. with advanced design\nmethods, achieving aerodynamic efficiency improvement at high Mach is\naccomplished with a methodical approach and a high confidence of success in\nplace of the emperical, that is, cut and try approach.\nThe advanced aero design methods are allowing a fairly rapid focussing\ntowards designs which improve upon Electra turboprop efficiencies. Of\ncourse, you can see that even t . 1950\'s turboprop technology used in the\nis\nElectra, which is the sane as that used on the P3, is far superior to the\ntypical general aviation turboprop. This is a direct result of the operating Mach number. The general aviation turboprops are gesigned to be\n.\nhighly efficient at 0 4 to 0.5 Mach cruise. The Electra technology offers\nno improvement there, but holds efficiency up high out to 0.6 Mach where\nit begins to drop off rapidly. Prop-Fan technology offers small gains at\n0.6 Mach but holds efficiency up high out to 0.85 Mach. The Electra\nachieves efficiency improvement over general aviation turboprops through\nlower blade thickness ratios, both at the blade tips and roots. The\nProp-Fan makes use of all the aerodynamic concepts discussed earlier: Thickness ratio, blade sweep and nacelle shaping. Wind tunnel test results on\n\ntwo-foot model Prop-Fans have demonstrated 80% efficiency which is the\nprogram objective. .Additional aero/acous tic designs are expected to\nem on strati on of this should\nimprove upon these results by a few percent.\noccur next year. Further improvements in efficiency can b obtained by\ne\nrecovering swirl. As much as eight efficiency points are lost in the\nslipstream of a single rotation rotor. Portions of this are recoverable\nby having the wing act as stator vanes or by using a counter-rotating\npropeller.\n\nAs with aerodynamics, controlling the acoustic levels required advacced\nconcepts and design methodologies. Both far field noise around the airport and interior noise in cruise must be controlled. Concepts which\nhave been considered in acoustic analysis conducted to date include\nreduced thickness ratio, reduced tip speed with increased blade count,\noptimum blade planform including swept shapes, and advanced airfoils.\nLet\'s consider their impact on far field noise. Noise reductions in the\nfar field have typically been achieved by reducing tip speed; this is a\nvery powerful noise reducing means, but in the past has been accompanied\nby performance reductions as well.\nThis traditional means of noise\nreduction can be accomplished without performance decrement by increasing\nrotor diameter, but this is usually an unattractive alternate. Studies\nwith new acoustic design methodology indicates that significant noise\nreductions can be achieved with improved airfoils, higher blades count,\nand a more optimum blade shape. Both airfoil optimization and increasing\nthe blade count have a compound impact on noise by reducing noise in\nthemselves but also improving efficiency so that for constant thrust, a\nsmaller diameter can do the same job. Improved blade shapes, including\nsweep, reduce noise significantly without diameter changes.\nThe advanced acoustic method mentioned above is a procedure developed\nspecifically for Prop-Fan cruise near fieid noise control but is generally\napplicable for any turboprop noise analysis. The noise method recognizes\nthe components of tone noise associated with thickness, loading, and\nquadruple. Thickness and loading aro linear components and are directly\nrelated to the blade surface pressure and geometric definition.\nQuadruple is a non-linear component related to the velocity derivatives\nin air around the airfoil. Non-linear effects are important when the airfoils are operating near their section critical Mach number. This method\nwhich recognizes the details of the blade allows much more effective noise\nreduction designs.\nAs mentioned earlier, blade sweep can be a very effective means for\nperformance improvement, that is, increasing efficiency and reducing\nnoise. The advantages of sweep for Prop-Fan are quite significant for high\nsubsonic airsped where the blade tip helical Mach number is supersonic.\nThe character of the aero&J-namic and acoustic improvements differ in that\nefficiency peaks at about 40 degrees of tip sweep while noise continues\nto decrease as sweep increases. The reason is that noise reduction is\nattributed to eliminating compressibility effects as with aero and also\nto a cancellation phenomenon. In fact, the cancellation of source noise\nby sweep can be accomplished for subsonic tip helicals as well, once\ncompressibility has been eliminated. For the latest Prop-Fan blade design\n\nefficleacy is up two percentage points and near field noise is down 18 dB\ncompared to a straight blade. For the Prop-Fan, near field source noise at\n0 8 Mach cruise i only one-third of the story associated with a comfortable\n.\ns\ninterior of about 80 dB \' ) .\nIn order to achieve this very quiet aircraft\ninterior noise level, source noise reductions are being pursued and the\nsource noise objectives are considered achieveable. Recent interior noise\ndata indicates that further reductions are possible by correctly handling\nphasing and rotation effects. Synchrophasing can reduce the level in the\npeak noise area substantially. Finally, the fuselage is designed for\nattenuation and there is about 20 dB noise reduction for a standard turbofan type fuselage. Increased noise attenuation fuselage designs are under\nstudy and are considered practical. So, at 0 8 Mach it is possible to\n.\nachieve a quiet interior. At lower Mach number it becomes easier.\nThe blade concept for improved efficiency and reduced noise must be\nstructurally sound. Blade construction is key to a propeller/Prop-Fan\ndesign. It establishes the structural dynamics, is the major weight\ncontributor, sizes the mechanical components, and establishes the\nmaintenance and reliability philosophy The spar-shell blade construction\nconcept, where the spar is metal structure and the shell is lightweight\nfiberglass, offers a large weight L eduction over the traditional solid\naluminum hlade and allows the shaping of the blade for enhanced performance\nwith fewer constraints. This spar-shell concept is safer and offers\nimproved reliability and enhanced maintenance. Reliability is imprwed\nin several ways such an integral (buried) blade heater and individually\nreplaceable blades. Failure probability is reduced by eliminating surface\ndamage as a source of structural degradation. Hamilton Standard has\naccomplished blade designs for swept blades using traditional beam analysis\nand the more sophisticated finite element analysis technique. The accuracy\nand the level. of information resulting from finite element analysis is\nquite superior to beam analysis. The stresses and deflections are defined\neverywhere on the spar, in the bond, and on the shell; and the mode shapes\nand natural frequencies are more precisely defined. The use of this\nadvanced analysis technique will provide a hlade design with high structural\ns\nconfidence and light weight. The Prop-Fan blade construction concept i\nan extension of the very successful current production fiberglass blade\nconfiguration. The highlights of the Hamilton Standard metal spar-composite\nshell experience die 5000 blades manufactured of 22 different designs.\nThirteen achieved flight test status and four of these achieved production.\nThe estimated biade flight time is 1.7 million hours.\n\nI have reviewed the last 20 plus years of Hamilton Standard blade safety\nexperience and the data shows about 35 million flight hours between inflight blade fractures on reciprocating engines and no in-flight fractures\non turbine engines in 60 million hours. This compares with general aviation\ndata indicating about one million flight hours between fractures. A review\nof our blade fractures indicates that all were due to damaged exterior\nsurfaces operating in the high engine vibratory environment of a recip.\nElimination of the recip environment has eliminated blade fractures. It\nis projected that elimination of the environmental damage to the blade\nstructure will reduce the probability of failure. Coupling this with\n\nimproved str~ctural\nanalysis techniques shouldvirtually eliminate blade\nfailures.\nstudy recently done for NASA determined the reliability and maintenance\ncosts for a typical turboprop propulsion system such as the Electra. Specific problem areas were isolated and improved upon in a preliminary design\nof a new Prop-Fan propulsion system. It was found that significant reliability improvements and mainte:.ance cost reductions could be achieved for\nboth the propeller and the turboprop related portions of the gearbox. In\nboth cases, adoption of a modern on-condition maintenance philosophy, thereby\neliminating scheduled major maintenance and overhaul, reduced costs in\nhalf. It was found on the Electra gearbox that the non-turboprop functions\nof engine and airframe accessory drives accounted for about 258 of the\ngearbox unscheduled maintenance costs. Such drives are necessary for any\npropulsion system and should be accounted with the core engine for\nturb3props as they are for turbofans. Lastly, as mentioned earlier on\nadvanced blades, improvements in cost can be made as a result of improved\nreliability and modularity. Simplified component hardware, individually\nremoved with simple procedures finally results in dollars per flight\nhour which are very low. The propulsion system maintenance cost is\ndominated by the turbine core engine, not the propulsive device.\n\nA\n\nAdvanced design techniques when applied to advanced turboprops or PropFans operating at high subsonic Mach number have improved performance\nover both conventional turboprops and high bypass turbofans. They\nadditionally offer uncompromised safety and high reliability/low\nmaintenance characteristics. Application of this propulsion concept\nextends the traditional turboprop utilization in General Aviation to\nhigh Mach where significant gains can be achieved over turbofans.\n\nADVANCED TURBOPROP POTENTIAL\nFOR HIGH SPEED\n\nProp- Fan\n\nFigure 1\n\nADVANCED TURBOPROP OBJECTIVES\n\nImproved Performan.:e Above M = 0.55\nLow Airport Noise\n\na Turbofan ,nterior Comfort\nEnhanced Structural Integrity\nReduced Operating Costs\nFigure 2\n\nVARIATION OF INSTALLED EFFICIENCY\n00\n90\n80\n70\n60\n\n50\n40\n0.5\n\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\nCruise Mach Number\nFigure 3\n\nFUEL SAVINGS\nProp-Fan Vs.

It has\nbeen estimated that in the use of the prop fan concept (Ref. I ) , a f u e l savings\nof approximately 36% can be realized over the turbofan through proper propeller\ndesign. Also, recent studies have shown a 5 fo 7% savings in f u e l efficiency\ncan be obtained (Ref. 2 ) through proper propeller design and c r f t i c a l examinations of propeller-nacelle interactions. As a result, a study supported by the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration Lewis Research Center w s i n i t i a a\nted involving the Ohio State University, Borst and Associates, Hartzell\nPropeller, Inc., and Rockwell Corporation of Bethany, Oklahcma t o evaluate and\neriance current analytical prediction methods f o r propellers designed specific a l l y for the twin engine Rockwell Aerocmander 690B. This three year study\nhas and w i l l involve computer prediction studies i n the theoretical evaluation\nof 2ropeiler performance; wind tunnel model t e s t s conducted a t the NASA Lewis\n3esearch Center; f l i g h t t e s t comparisons; and enhancement of the theoretical\nmethods by means of ccmparison with wind tunnel and f l i g h t t e s t s . The intent\nof t h i s paper is t o b r i e f l y cover aspects related t o propeller performance and\nt o i l l u s t r a t e preliminary data resulting f r m the wind tunnel t e s t s of two\npropellers i n this study. It i s intended t h a t a report w i l l be made a t a i l a b l e\non the canparisons between the theoretical predictions and the complete experimental data s e t resulting f r m the wind tunnel t e s t s .\n\n*This study was funded by NASA Lewis Research Center under NASA Grant NSG 3247.\n\nPROPELLER PERFORMANCE bdETHODS\nA brief review of the methodologies ( ~ e f .3 ) used i n predicting propeller\nperformance ( ~ i g .1 ) has been included in this work for completeness. Prop e l l e r theories have proceeded from the simple Rankine-Froude momentum disc\ntheory (Refs. 4 , 5 ) uhich assumes t h a t the propeller disc is replaced by a disc\nwith an i n f i n i t e number of blades producing a uniform change i n velocity of the\nstream passing through the disc. This th2ory is useful i n calculatin- theorepropeller\nt i c a l maximum efficiencies but does not Ceal in the d e t a i l s of t?.\nconfiguration such a s number of blades snd blade thickness. These factors are\nconsidered i n the blade element analysis (Refs. 6,7)the next degree of\nsophistication, which deals i n the forward and rotational velocity components\nt o determine t h e resultant velocity or the effective pitch angle and hence the\nangle-of-attack a s seen by each a i r f o i l sention making up the propeller blade.\nHere the angle-of-attack i s taken a s the difference between the geometric pitch\nangle and the effective pitch angle (Fig 2 ) and a s m s t h a t the induced flow\npast the blade element is the same a s past a wing with an aspect r a t i o c f six.\nThe simple blade element theory has been used f o r preliminary calculai:\',nr,s a d\nin some eases gives accurate answers within 10%of the measured thrust and\ntorque values.\n\nMore precise r e s u l t s may be obtahed i n the prediction of thrust and\ntorque by calculaling the local induced velocities a t each r a d i a l s t a t i o n\nf\n(Fig. 2 ) by means of vortex theory ( ~ e. 8). Here, the combination of simple\nmomentum theory and blade element analysis r e s u l t s i n a theory t h a t also\naccounts f o r rotation of t h e s l i p stream. However t h i s approach, although providing an accurate approximation, s t i l l does not account f a r t i , p losses, blade\nt o blade interference, and nonuniform flow i n the disc plane resulting from the\npresence of 2 nacelle.\nThe next order of development and accuracy cane with the Goldstein liftirgl i n e model ( ~ e f .9 ) where the blade is replaced by a s e r i e s of horseshoe vort i c e s as sham i n Figure 1. The approximation of blade replacernen-:, by vortices\nis acceptable since most generc.1 aviation propellers have a r e l a t i v e l y high\naspec+, r a t i o . Also, the l i f t i n g l i n e approach can u t i l i z e corrections f o r\nviscosity and canpressibility but i s accepted a s an "approximate method" using\nthe Goldstefn factor. The Goldstein factor mthod is usually taken f o r l i g h t l y\nloaded propellers where the Betz condition holds, =d does not apply t o other\nthan constant pitch propellers i n uniform flow (Ref. 3 ) . The l i f t i n g l i n e\nproblem can also be solved by the "rigorous method!\' using Lerbfs induction\nfactor method (Ref 9 ) which is based on the velocity potential of h e l i c a l\nvortex l i n e s applied t o ai3y moderately loaded optimum or non-optimum propeller\noperating i n a uniform o r nonuniform f r e e stream (Ref. 3 ) . This is the method\nof analysis t h a t has been used i n the performance comparisons t o be shown i n a\nl a t e r section of t h i s paper.\n\n.\n\nA s the propeller configurations change t o r e l a t i v e l y small apsect r a t i o\nand/or large surface areas (Fig. I ) as i n the prop-fan concept (Ref. I ) ,\nadvsnced analytical methods must be used such as the Ludwig-Ginzel l i f t i n g surface model (Ref. 10) t o model the propeller f low f i e l d accurately. These\nadvanced methods and the current state-of-the-art have been discussed by Bober\n\nand Mitchell (Ref. 1 1 ) in addition t c the importance of wake modeling.\n\nIt is the purpose of the present e f f o r t t o compare d i r e c t l y with experimental data the theoretical predicticm r e s u l t s of vortex theory and l i f t i n g\nl i n e theory t o determine the ranges of applicability and levels of accuracy.\nThe current wind tunnel t e s t s cover a broad range i n advance ratios, blade\nangle settings, and f l i g h t conditions for four general aviation propellers,\neach having different a c t i v i t y factors and propeller blade sections. In so\ndoing, the current methods may be enhanced t o pro-ride increased accuracy i n the\npredic t i a n of propeller performance.\nPRfiPELLER AIRFOIL DEVELOPMENT\nAirfoil development f o r propeller applications has been limited with the\ncontinual use of the Clark Y and RAF 6 s e r i e s a i r f o i l s . The l a s t major develop\nment i n t h i s area occurred with the development of the NACA 16 s e r i e s a i r f o i l s\n(Ref. 1 2 ) and a s shown i n Figure 3 does have r e l a t i v e l y good prformance i n\nterms of the metric CL/CD a s a function of CI,. This a i r f o i l has +,he characteri s t i c " f l a t bottom1\', maxirm thickness occurring a t approximateiy tke 50%point,\nand a small leading edge radius with many of the design characteristics dictated by manufacturing constraints. Therefore many propellers of today incorpora t e the Clark Y o r RAF 6 a i r f o i l series during the i n i t i a l 50% of the blade\ntransitiont o the NACA 16 s e r i e s which has a high drag divergence Mach\nnumber in the outer segment of the propeller where the resultant Mach numbers\ncan approach upity.\nBocci ( ~ e f .13) i n a paper published i n 1977 described a new s e r i e s of\npropeller a i r f o i l sections e n t i t l e d the A . - s e r i e s . Here, the manufacturing\n9AD\nconstraints have been relaxed a s shown i n Fi-gure 3 resulting i n a section\nincorporating increased camber on the underside of the a i r f o i l ; drooped leading\nedge t o prevent leading edge s t a l l a t high angle-of-attack; and an increased\nleading edge radius. The r e s u l t s of t h i s design approach can be seen in\nFigure 3 with an improvement over the performance of the NACA 16 s e r i e s a t the\nhigh l i f t coefficients. The importance of the a i r f o i l section t o propeller\nperformance is indicated i n Figure 4 where it can be seen t h a t the a i r f o i l\npressure distributions which evolve i n t o the aerodynamic coefficients determine\nthe load distribution and also allows an acoustic evaluation by the s t r i p\nmethod. In a l a t e r study, the authors ( ~ e f .1 4 ) have compared the aerodynamic\nperformance and acoustic estimates of the ARA-D, Clark Y and NACA 16 series\nairfoils.\nIn the discussions gf propeller a i r f o i l development, the w i l d tunnel t e s t s\nof the propellers i n t h i s study incorporate a variety of a i r f o i l sections, i . e . ,\n(a)\n(b )\n(c)\n(d)\n\nClark Y - NACA 16 a i r f o i l s\nARA-D a i r f o i l s\nGA(w) a i r f o i l s\n6 series airfoils\n\nSince a l l have been designed f o r the Aerocomander 690 B, a comparison of the\n\npropeller performence can be interpreted as a cmpariaon of these a i r f o i l s in\nterms of efficiency ( ! thrust coefficient (CT), and power coefficient (Cp)\ns,\nwhich t r e discussed i n the following sections.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROPELLER PERFOWCE ~\n\n~\n\nN\n\nT\n\nS\n\nPropeller performance experimental values were obtained i n the presmt\nprogram through use of the Propeller Test R i g ( PTFt ) ( ~ e f 15) installed i n the\nsubsonic leg of the 10 foot x 10 foot supersonic wind tunnel located a t the\nNASA Lewis Research Center. The configuration tested also incorporated equival e n t body of revolution representatin@-the actual nacelle of the Rockwell\nAeroc-der\n690 B including a scaled representation of the spinner (Fig. 5 ).\nPressure orifices were located along the periph,-y of the nacelle a t two azimut h a l locations t o aid in evaluating the drag of the nacelle and its effect on\nthe performance of the propeller.\n\n.\n\nThree f l i g h t conditions were examined f o r the approximately 0.5 scale propellers, i.e., take-off (M = O.11), climb (M = 0.23), and the cruise condition\n(M = 0.39). The advance r a t i o (J) was varied f o r a fixed blade angle setting\nby fixing the t e s t section Mach nuniber through manipulation of the wind tunnel\nsecond throat and changing RPM. Values of propeller thrust and torque rere\nde&dced from the experimental measurements and the thrust coefficient ( CT ),\ntorque coefficient (CQ), power coefficient (Cp), and efficiency ( rl ) were determined by t h i s method. An appropriate range i n J values ws examined with\na\nrespect t o the actual operating conditions o r u n t i l s t a l l - f l u t t e r was encountered.\nThe f i r s t propeller tested on the FTR i n the configuration s h m in Figure\n5 consisted of Clark Y-NACA 16 a i r f o i l s with an a c t i v i t y factor of 101. The\npreliminary results are shorn i n Figure 6 f o r the cruise condition (M = 0.39,\nB = 4e0) in terms of efficiency ( q ) a s a function of the advance r a t i o (J).\nAlso shown i n t h i s figure a r e the theoretical estimates using vortex theory*\nand l i f t i n g l i n e theory previously discussed. -9s can be seen, at the lower J\nvalues the l i f t i n g l i n e prediction coincides with the experimental data with a\nresulting overprediction for J values i n excess of 2.3. T h i s may be compared\ndirectly with the vortex theory r e s u l t s which overpredicts the experimental\ndata over the enti.re range of J values. A similar r e s ~ l t also found f o r an\nis\noff-design condit~onas shown i n Figwe 7.

Here vortex theory m e e s well with the experimental data a t the\nlow J values with disagreement occurring a t J values in excess of 1.2. A s\nfound previously, an investigation of the off-design condition as shown i n\nFigure 9 also produces similar results.\n\nB~he\nvortex theory i s presently under examination t o include the influence of\nthe blade-spinner interference which could r e s u l t i n better correlation with\nexperiment.\n\nThe a c o n d propeller tested having an a c t i v i t y f a c t o r of 83 u t i l i z e d the\nARA-D a i r f o i l sections previously discussed.

Also, u t i l i z , , t i m of a rdte rake probe (Fig. 11) is\npresently in use to obtain meas~~e=i.ts:of t o t a l pressure d e f i c i t , flow aagul a r i t y , arrd s t a t i c pressure meamrattents behind the d i s c plane of each propeller tested as a function of r a d i a l lacation. These data w i l l result i n\nindepeudent thrust measurements as w e l l a s d e t a i l s of the prapeller wake rhich\ncan be c q m - e d directly to the current theoretical rake model being used.\n=%se results rill be included in the reports previwslg mentioned a t a iat-er\ndate.\n\nLIMZTATIrn OF CURRENT AmLYSEs\n\nThe theorezical analyses t h a t have been utilized in the comparisons with\nexperimental data previousiy discussed a r e analytical models which contain\nlimitations. For example, the importance of an accurate rake model and propeller/nacelle interactions has teen enphasized by Bober (Ref. 11) in the\nprediction of high speed propeller performance pivdictions. Further, the result of a f i n i t e blade length, i.e., recognition of t i p flow is necessary f o r\nan evaluatian of three-dimensional effects. This e f f e c t has been treated by\nCooper (Ref. 16) by obtaining a correction factor t o the lift-curve slope a s a\nftincticn of the radial location but is valid f o r propellers using only NACA 16\nand 6 s e r i e s a i r f o i l s .\n\nAlm rhen considering l h i t a t i a n s , t h e area of centrifugal viscous e f f e c t s\non the l i f t coefficient should be considered. In an expx=imental investigation\nby ) r ! l s k a m p (Ref. 17), he had found t h a t there i s a significant relationship\nbetween the magnitude of CL and the radial loczi$ion of tlle propeller blade. In\na series of t e s t s with a propeller made ap of GO625 a i r f o i l s , fiinunelsbamp fixed\nthe wgle-of-attack a t each radial location and measured the section l i f t coefficient. These values of CL were then canpared t o the two-dimensional l i f t\n\'\ncoefficient, as given in F - a r e 12, f o r the a = 5 case and found t o be co-:siderably higher with the greatest difference occuring a t the root and decreasing a s the propeller radius increased. These differences may be attributed t o\ncentrifugal viscous effects which obviously are not accounted f o r in twodimensional theory. Since a l l propeller performance analyses u t i l i z e an a i r f o i l data bank based upon two-dimensional experimental and analytical data, t h e\ndifferences indicated in Figure 12 i f properly modeled could have a significant\ninfiuenw in the prediction aczuracy of propeller performance theoretical\nvalues and resulting caparisons with experimental data.\nAs previously indicated, propeller performance analyses u t i l i z e a i r f o i l\nof\ndata banks c ~ n s i s t i n g wind tunnel t e s t and anblytical computer codes.\n\nAdvancements made i n t b e t h e o r e t i c a l a n a l p s i s of a i r f s i l s has been considerable\nr l t h t h e a v a i l a b i l i t y of such s u b c r i t i e a l computer codes a s Smetana, et. al.\n(Ref 1 8 ) and Eppler (Ref. 19).
