Slopes are indistinguishable for the three populations, probably indicating that the surfaces are dominated by primary craters. Treating the crater populations of Tycho, the floor of Copernicus, and Apollo 12 as primary crater populations contaminated, but not overwhelmed, with secondaries, allows an attempt at calibration of the post-heavy bombardment cratering flux. Using the age of Tycho as 109 m.y., Copernicus as 800 m.y., and Apollo 12 as 3.26 billion yr, there is no basis for assuming that the flux has changed over the past 3.3 billion yr. This result can be used for dating intermediate aged surfaces by crater density.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19780057840, "endDate": "1977-03-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Lunar Science Conference", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "ea25aed4f3b34a31be5ab301a99030dd", "startDate": "1977-03-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780057840, "id": "a20260680437425b97bc472cc6a648e2", "publicationDate": "1977-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
