The large-scale variability of pressure, temperature, and zonally averaged wind at the Lander sites is described, and small-scale phenomena involving the boundary layer and internal gravity waves are discussed. Observational evidence for the existence of transient planetary-scale waves, forced quasi-stationary waves, and thermal tides on Mars is examined. Atmospheric dynamics and properties of dust storms are considered, with emphasis on dust properties and distribution, the time evolution of planetwide dust storms, and dust-storm genesis and decay. Attention is also given to the nature of past Martian climates, the sizes and composition of volatile reservoirs, and volatile escape from the atmosphere.", "title": "Martian meteorology", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T22:38:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19790070125, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Leovy, C.
