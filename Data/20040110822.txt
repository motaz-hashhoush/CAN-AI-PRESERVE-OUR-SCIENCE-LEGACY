Raultt\nNASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA 23681\nAn aerothermodynamic analysis of t h e Commercial Experiment Transporter (COMET) reentry capsule\nhas been performed using the laminar thin-layer Navier-Stokes solver Langley Aerothermodynamic Upwind\nRelaxation Algorithm. Flowfield solutions were obtained a t Mach numbers 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 27.5.\nAxisymmetric and 5, 10, and 20 degree angles of attack were considered across t h e Mach-number range, with\nt h e Mach 25 conditions taken to 90 degrees angle of attack and t h e Mach 27.5 cases taken to 60 degrees\nangle of attack. Detailed surface heat-transfer rates were computed at Mach 20 and 25, revealing that\nheating rates on t h e heat-shield shoulder ,can exceed t h e stagnation-point heating by 230 percent. F i n i t e r a t e\nchemistry solutions were periormed above Mach 10, otherwise perfect gas computations were made. Drag,\nlift, and pitching moment coefficients are computed and details of a wake flow are presented. The effect of\nincluding t h e wake in t h e solution domain was investigated and base pressure corrections to forebody drag\ncoefficients were numerically determined for t h e lower Mach numbers. Pitching moment comparisons are\nmade with direct simulation Monte Carlo results in t h e more rarefied flow at t h e highest Mach numbers,\nshowing agreement within two-percent. Thin-layer Navier-Stokes computations of t h e axial force are found\nto be 15 percent higher across t h e speed range than t h e empirical/Newtonian based results used during t h e\ninitial trajectory analyses.\n\nNomenclature\n\nSubscript:\n\nDrag coefficient\nLift coefficient\nPitching moment coefficient\nMach number\nHeat transfer rate, W/cm2\nTemperature, K\nVelocity, m / s\nCartesian coordinates\nAngle of attack, degrees\nRatio of specific heats\ndensity, kg/m3\n\n\'Aerospace Technologist, Aerothermodynamics Branch,\n\nQ3\n\nfreestream value\n\nIntroduction\n\nGas\n\nDynamics Division.

COMET, managed by EER\nSystems Corp., grew out of NASA\'s Centers for the\nCommercial Development of Space p r ~ g r a r n . A low~\ncost approach toward development of the COMET return system was undertaken by relying heavily upon\nengineering analysis tools rather than state-of-the-art\ncomputational fiuid dynamic techniques and groundbased testing. Prior to EER assuming control of the\nwhole project in 1994, Space Industries, Inc. determined\npreliminary aerodynamic coefficients during the design\nphase from empirical correlations or modified Newtonian\ncalculation^.^ Contracts\' have been set for a first launch\nduring the autumn of 1995\' from Wallops Island, Va.,\nwith splash-down in the Atlantic Ocean off the Virginia\n*Destroyed in launch explosion, October 23, 1995.\n\nM\nL.,\n\ncoast. The first launch is not a demonstration flight, but\nrather a fully-operational mission with payloads. The\noperational vehicle is to be named METEOR-Multiple\nExperiment Transporter to Earth Orbit and Return.\nSince COMET is launched and recovered from a\nNASA facility, NASA undertook a mission safety assessment of the reentry capsule to ensure minimal risk\nto population centers, performing additional trajectory\nand landing-footprint analyses. The NASA trajectories\nsought to refine the dispersion analyses6 used during\nprogram development to a state-of-the-art level. While\nliability in the commercial space sector7 is becoming\na strong driver for mission successes, the NASA program focused primarily on mission safety issues, trying\nfor conservative estimates on landing dispersions. Close\ncommunication and cross-feedback with EER was maintained throughout the NASA project. This effort provided input to the Department of Transportation review\nconducted as part of licensing the return system.\nIn support of these trajectory analyses the present\nstudy provided an improved aerodynamic dataset for the\nCOMET reentry capsule throughout the hypersonic and\nsupersonic flight regimes. Three-sigma uncertainties on\naerodynamics used in previous dispersion analyses were\nestimated at 10-20 percent.8 The current study applies\nEuler and Navier-Stokes class algorithms, including reacting flow gas chemistry] to obtain more comprehensive\npredictions for the lift, drag, and moment coefficients]\nused to refine the dispersion analysis of the COMET\nreentry capsule.\n\n- E2\n\n-\n\na = 10 deg\n\n50\n\nX,\nin.\n0\n\n-50\n\n-100\n\n0\n\nZ,\n\n100\n\nin.\n\nFig. 1 Sample full-flowfield and non-wake symmetry\nplane grids, coarsened to show every-other\nbody-normal point.\nstudy. LAURA is an upwind, point-implicit, secondorder-accurate fluid dynamics solver based on an extension of the Roe flux-differencesplitting scheme\'\' that\nhas been used to analyze such reentry capsules as the\nAeroassist Flight Experiment13 and Mars Pathfinder\nMission. l4\nBoth Euler and laminar thin-layer Navier-Stokes SOlutions were obtained with LAURA about the COMET\nvehicle with perfect-gas (y = 1.4) and seven-species, oneand two-temperature, finite-rate air. A fully-catalytic\nwall boundary condition was employed for the reacting\ncases. Steady-state assumptions were imposed. A plane\nof symmetry was assumed for three-dimensional solutions and circumferential symmetry was assumed for axisymmetric solutions. The vehicle rotation, nominally\nthree revolutions per minute at the atmospheric entry\npoint, was not modeled.\nModifications were made to LAURA during this\nstudy to facilitate grid adaptions with wake flows by terminating the downstream grid 350 inches from the body,\napproximately seven vehicle diameters. Also, an entropy\ncondition check was installed for defining the bow shock\nlocation in the grid alignment procedure to handle lowMach-number wakes. An energy limiter was applied as\nnecessary during the initial transitory solution time to\nprevent non-physical conditions from developing on the\nvehicle base.\n\nConfiguration\nThe COMET reentry capsule, pictured in profile in\nFig. 1, is an axisymmetric design with a spherical heatshield of 48-in. radius. The frontal diameter and area are\n52 in. and 2124 in?, respectively, and are the nondimensionalizing length and area used in computing the aerodynamic coefficients. All moment coefficients reported\nhere are referenced to a point on the axis of revolution 17.6 in. back from the nosetip. The heat-shield is\ncomposed of a moderate-density, filled silicone syntactic\nfoam in a phenolic-fiberglass honeycomb. An approximation to the true vehicle geometry was made on the\nbase, which is modeled here as a flat disc connecting the\nsides with the rocket nozzle cover. In reality this region\nis recessed by approximately four inches and the volume\noccupied by the parachutes.\n\nComputational Grid\nThe computational grid used 64 cells in the bodynormal direction] 36 cells circumferentially for the threedimensional cases, and 66-72 cells down the body for the\nfull-wake solutions. A close-up view of a full-wake-grid\nsymmetry plane can be seen in the left-half of Fig. 1.\n\nAlgorithm\nThe Langley Aerothermodynamic Upwind Relaxation Algorithm (LAURA)g-" was used to generate the\ncomputational aerodynamic predictions in the current\n\n2\n\nE\n\nM-\n\n48 x 12 x 64, 95 x 18 x 64, and 95 x 36 x 64-cell grids,\ncounting streamwise, circumferentially, and normal to\nthe body. The 64 points in the body-normal direction\nwere chosen based on the grid convergence analysis performed by Weilmuen~ter\'~\nAxial force coefficients are\nwithin one percent on all three grids and pitching moment coefficients, compared to the finest-grid results, are\nwithin three percent on the coarsest grid and one percent\non the intermediate grid.\n\n= 25.4\n\na = 90 deg\n\n-X,\n\nCases\n\nin.\n\nAn initial trajectory was defined by the POST16\ncode based on the preliminary engineering approximations to the COMET aerodynamics. The capsule is expected to enter the rarefied atmosphere at approximately\n70 degrees angle of attack. While deceleration and heating loads are low in the free molecular and transitional\ndomains, the accurate determination of the pitching moment at these altitudes is essential to determine if the\ncapsule will weather-cock into a heat-shield-first attitude by the time it reaches the continu.um atmosphere,\ndefined as Knudson numbers less than order 1, or below 90 kmfor the COMET vehicle. A concurrent study\ncomputed a matrix of flowfield simulations in the transitional domain between the free molecular and continuum\nlimits using a direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)\napproach.\nThe DSMC code was originally devised by Bird17\nand extended for applications to complex geometries by\nRault.l8 This approach tracks a large ensemble of discrete molecules, handling all the physics through molecular collisions rather than with fluid equations of motion.\nDSMC is currently the only practical technique with sufficient accuracy to realistically simulate very rarefied kinetics. Results of this DSMC study indicated that the\nCOMET reentry capsule will generate enough turning\nmoment to rotate the vehicle to a heat-shield-first attitude by 90 km altitude. A sampling of the DSMC\nresults are presented here showing continuity of pitching\nmoment determinations between DSMC and LAURA.\nThirty-six complete computational fluid dynamics\nsolutions were obtained with LAURA at discrete Mach\nnumbers ranging from 1.5-27 and an angle-of-attack\nrange of 0-20 degrees. Side-slip was not modeled, as the\nvehicle is axisymmetric. The Mach 20, 25, and 27 cases\nwere taken to 30, 90, and 60 degrees, respectively. The\nfreestream conditions for each trajectory point are enumerated in Table 1, as well as a specification to whether\nthe solutions were viscous or inviscid, with perfect gas\nor reacting air chemistry, and with or without the basewake domain included in the calculations.\n\nFig. 2 High-angle-of-attack full-flowfield grid.\nCalculations in the wake region assumed a laminar shear\n.layer.\nGrids without wakes, seen on the right side of Fig. 1,\nencompassed the forebody heat-shield and vehicle sidewalls, back to the 90 degree corner where the base begins, 43 inches from the nose. This breakpoint was chosen for the non-wake solutions because the flow typically\nundergoes a strong expansion at that point, limiting the\nupstream influence of the wake on the forebody flowfield.\nThe grids were initially generated algebraically and\nthen adapted as the solution evolved, aligning the grid\nwith the bow shock and clustering points in the boundary layer. A full wake grid is presented in Fig. 2 for a\nMach 25,90 degree angle-of-attack case, highlighting the\nwake flow grid-adaption results.\nFor the aerodynamic calculations the heat-shield\nshoulder is modeled as a sharp corner. Due to extremely\nhigh heating the corner is anticipated to ablate into a\nnaturally rounded shoulder. To investigate the surface\nheating distribution more realistically in the vicinity of\nthe heat-shield shoulder, three solutions about the peak\nheating portion of the trajectory, at Mach 20 and 25,\nwere obtained with a quarter-inch (0.635 cm) shoulder\nradius. Eight computational cells were used to define\nthe shoulder in these cases, with a total of 95 streamwise\ncells used to ease the grid stretching around the shoulder.\nAlthough the shoulder rounding is expected to occur in\nflight due to ablation, no ablative effects were modeled in\nthe computations. An ablative and/or finite-catalycity\nheat-shield would be expected to lower the heating rates,\nso the heat-transfer computations here are conservative\npredictions. The effect of a shoulder radius did not influence the vehicle aerodynamics.\nGrid convergence was spot checked with respect to\nconvergence of the vehicle aerodynamic coefficients. At\nMach 25 and 30 degrees angle of attack the viscous,\nseven-species, two-temperature solution was obtained on\n3\n\nTable 2 COMET aerodynamic coefficients.\n\nTable 1 COMET trajectory points.\n\nTm, K\n\nMoo\n\nV,, m/S\n\n1.51\n2.00\n5.06\n9.97\n15.1\n20.1\n\n451\n601\n1560\n3200\n5006\n6429\n\n3.84~10-~\n2.68~10-~\n8.88~10-~\n3.12~10-~\n1.14~10-~\n4.31~10-~\n\n212\n224\n236\n255\n271\n255\n\n25.4\n\n7442\n\n5.84xlO-\'\n\n213\n\npo0, kg/m3\n\n187\n27.5\n7563\n3.41 x\n"Perfect gas, inviscid.\nbPerfect gas, viscous, wake included.\n\'Reacting air, viscous.\ndReacting air, viscous, wake included.\n\na,deg\nOf 54 10; 20\'\nOf 54 10: 20"\n0 54 10: 20"\n:\n0 54 104 20"\n;\n0: 5 104 20"\n:\n0: 5: 10: 15:\n20: 30d\n0 5 10: 20:\n: :\n30: 40: 60: 90d\n04 20: 40: 60d\n\nMoo\n1.51\n\nAngle of attack, deg.\n0\n5\n10\n20\nCD 1.56 1.57\n1.51\n1.45\n-0.266\nCL 0.\n-0.0586 -0.208\nCm 0.\n-0.0256 -0.0429 -0.0809\n\nCD 1.55 1.54\n1.50\nCL 0.\n-0.0734 -0.170\nCm 0.\n\n5.06\n\n-0.0210\n\n-0.0374\n\n1.42\n-0.233\n-0.0755\n\nCD 1.49\n\n2.00\n\n1.45\n-0.0882\n-0.0152\n\n1.43\n-0.172\n-0.0302\n\n1.27\n-0.280\n-0.0591\n\nCL 0.\nCm 0.\n\n9.97\n\n1.41\nCD 1.47 1.47\n-0.0912 -0.171\nCL 0.\n\nC,\n\nCD 1.54\n\nM\n,\n0\n\n15.1\n\n1.51\n\nm\n\n0.\n\n2.00\n\nCL\nC\nm\n\n20.1\n\n0.\n0.\n\ni\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n1.54\n-0.0929\n-0.0169\n\n1.48\n-0.179\n-0.0326\n\n1.32\n-0.312\n-0.0594\n\n-0.0165\n\n-0.0323\n\nCD 1.55 1.54\n1.51\n-0.187\nCL 0.\n-0.0962\nC\nm\n\n0.5\n\n-0.0301\n\nCD 1.56 1.54\n1.49\n-0.0981 -0.188\nCL 0.\nCm 0.\n\n25.4\n\n-0.0151\n\n1.27\n-0.291\n-0.0575\n\n0.\n\n-0.0167\n\n-0.0318\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1.32\n-0.320\n-0.0597\n1.33\n-0.310\n-0.0602\n\n100\n\na, degrees\n\n27.5\n\nCD 1.64\nCL 0.\n\nl\nn\n-c\n\nFig. 3 COMET drag coefficients.\n\nResults\n\n0.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1.45\n-0.262\n-0.0554\n\nods used in Ref. 4 show that the current results predict\na 15 percent higher drag for COMET. The correspondingly lower ballistic coefficient indicates more deceleration at higher altitudes and reduces the down-range\nflight distance of the reentry capsule relative to the preliminary design analyses.\n\nAerodynamic coefficients\nDrag, lift, and moment coefficients, respectively, are\nplotted in Figs. 3-5 versus angle of attack for the eight\ntrajectory points. The aerodynamic data is tabulated in\nTable 2, for 0-20 degrees angle of attack, Table 3, for\n40-90 degrees angle of attack, and Table 4, for the three\nheating cases.\nThe COMET vehicle is at a maximum-drag condition, Fig. 3, about zero angle of attack. The zero-angleof-attack drag coefficients vary between 1.55 at Mach 1.5\nand 2, down below 1.5 as the Mach number increases\nto 10, then rise back to 1.55 by Mach 25 and above as the\nfreestream conditions become more rarefied.

This behavior is expected with the very\nblunt configuration producing an axial force that dominates the normal force. The lift-curve slope is relatively constant between 0-20 degrees angle of attack at\n-0.015 per degree. The largest magnitude lift-to-drag\nratio is -0.32 for Mach 20, 30 degree angle-of-attack conditions. At the higher Mach numbers the vehicle is seen\nto return to a zero-lift condition at 60 degrees angle of\nattack.

The moment coefficient\nslope has an average value of -0.0032 per degree between\n0 4 0 degrees angle of attack, nearly independent of Mach\nnumber. Beyond 60 degrees angle of attack the vehicle\nbecomes less stable, though the moment is still negative so a restoring moment toward zero angle of attack\nis maintained.\nThe variation in pitching-moment coefficient with\naltitude at 60 degrees angle of attack is presented in\nFig. 6. The altitudes range from the rarefied regime\nabove 135 km, where the free-molecular calculation is\nappropriate, through the transitional freestream conditions computed with the DSMC code, to the continuum\nresults of L A U U .

This was to correct for\nneglecting the wake region in these solutions. For the\nMach 1.5, 5 degree angle-of-attack case the axial force\ncoefficient was increased by 18 percent. At Mach 2 the\naxial force coefficients for both 5 and 20 degree angles-ofattack were increased by 11 percent. These corrections\nwere obtained from the 0 and 10 degree angle-of-attack\ncases done at Mach 1.5 and 2, which were computed\nboth with and without the wake.

At Mach 5 the reacting-flow drag coefficient\nis 0.6 percent higher than the perfect-gas result. At\nMach 10 the reacting-flow drag is computed to be two\npercent higher than perfect-gas drag, as 1.516. Finiterate calculations were made for all cases above Mach 10.\nComparisons were also made between viscous and\ninviscid perfect gas calculations for the axisymmetric,\nMach 5 conditions. The inviscid drag coefficient, 1.462,\nis within 0.3 percent of the viscous result, 1.458, with\nboth solutions performed without the wake domain.\nThis is because the post-shock pressure on the heatshield is the dominant contributer to drag, and no separation at the shoulder was seen at the lower angles\nof attack. The perfect-gas, non-wake results presented\nhere were inviscid calculations, and all wake-inclusive\nand reacting-flow solutions were viscous calculations.\n\n0.57\n\n= -- M& M k\n\nshow this expression yields corrections 24 percent larger\nthan those from the LAURA study at Mach 1.5.\nAt small angles of attack over most of the trajectory\nthe wake recirculation region is confined to the base of\nthe vehicle and a forebody flowfield solution plus basepressure correction obtains accurate vehicle aerodynamics. At the lower Mach numbers, particularly Mach 1.5,\nand moderate angles of attack the wake recirculation is\nnot confined to the base of the vehicle, making the basepressure correction approach less reliable.\nFigure 7 shows a close-up view of the streamlines in\nthe symmetry plane around the vehicle and in the wake\nfor Mach 1.5, 20 degree angle-of-attack conditions. The\nlaminar thin-layer approximation was used in all calculations. The flowfield can be seen to separate on the\nleeside at the heat-shield shoulder. A large recirculation\nregion in the wake extends from the base up and around\nthe entire leeside of the vehicle. A three-dimensional\nstructure in the wake can be seen in the source and sink\ntoroidal vortex behind the vehicle. Fluid is entrained\nat the windside center of the vortex, located approximately 10 in. behind the retro-rocket nozzle. The fluid\nis pumped around the toroid and emerges in the symmetry plane as a source located at coordinates (-75,20) in\nFig. 7.\n\nHeating\nSurface heat-transfer rates were computed about the expected peak heating time of the reentry trajectory. Results at Mach 20 with 15 and 30 degrees angle of attack\nand Mach 25 at 30 degrees angle of attack are presented\nin Table 4 for the stagnation point and maximum shoulder heating. While the manufactured capsule has a sharp\ncorner at the edge of the heat-shield, in-flight degradation during reentry is expected to naturally round the\nshoulder. For the results presented here the shoulder\nradius was a pn\'on\'set to 0.25 in. (6.4 mm).\nThe small shoulder radius causes a strong expansion and acceleration of the flow around the edge of the\nheat-shield, thinning the boundary layer considerably\n6\n\n\xe2\x80\x98and producing locally high heating on the shoulder. The\ndegree of this heating spike is seen to depend upon angle\nof attack, as for the 15 degree angle-of-attack case the\npeak heating is 1.7 times the stagnation-point heating\nwhile for the two 30 degree angle-of-attack cases the peak\nheating on the shoulder is 2.2-2.3 times the stagnationpoint heating, reaching a maximum of 200 W/cm2 at\nMach 20.\nWindside and leeside centerline surface heattransfer rates for the Mach 20, 30 degree angle-of-attack\nconditions are displayed in Fig. 8. This plot zooms in on\nthe heat-shield and shoulder region, extending along the\naxial axis 8 in. (20 cm) back from the nose-tip. For this\ncase, Fig. 8 does not show a heat-transfer peak along the\ncenterline at the stagnation point, as might be expected\non the spherical heat-shield. The stagnation point itself was located as the maximum in the surface pressure data. Significant spikes in the heating are seen at\nthe heat-shield shoulder on both the wind and lee sides.\nWhile the high shoulder-heating rates on the windside\nare of concern for determining the heat-shield thickness,\nthe vehicle rotation during reentry will tend to distribute\nthe shoulder heat load around the circumference of the\nheat-shield.\n\nMach 25.4 conditions taken to 90 degrees angle of attack\nand the Mach 27.5 cases taken to 60 degrees angle of\nattack. Perfect gas computations were performed for\nthe Mach 10 and lower cases, while finite-rate-chemistry\nair calculations were made for Mach numbers above 10.\nComparison calculations at Mach 10 showed a two percent difference in drag coefficient between perfect-gas\nand finite-rate solutions, with even less difference seen\nat Mach 5, as would be expected.\nTwo solution domains were solved: one full-vehicle\ngrid encompassing the wake region and a second grid\nencompassing the heat-shield and sidewall domains, but\nnot the base or wake. The wake was neglected on the\nlow angle of attack solutions between Mach 10 and 20.\nA base pressure correction was made to the axial force\ncoefficient at Mach 1.5, 5 degrees angle of attack and\nMach 2, 5 and 20 degree angles of attack. These base\npressure corrections were determined from repeated calculations at Mach 1.5 and 2 using grids both with and\nwithout the wake domain. The effect of including the\nwake on vehicle aerodynamics was found to be negligible at higher Mach numbers. All high-angle-of-attack\ncases included the wake domain.\nSurface heat-transfer rates were computed at\nMach 20 and 25, with particular attention paid to the\nheat-shield shoulder region. Peak shoulder heating can\nbe 2.2-2.3 times the stagnation point heat-transfer rate,\ncomputed assuming no ablation and a fully-catalytic\nwall.\nAxisymmetric drag coefficients varied from a low of\n1.47 at Mach 10 to a high of 1.64 at Mach 27.5. The\ndrag coefficient decreases at non-zero angles of attack.\nNegative lift is generated at angles of incidence, with\nthe lift coefficient varying between 0 and -0.32. The\nvehicle is statically stable, trimmed about zero angle of\nattack, with a value of approximately -0.0032 per degree\nfor Cm,abetween 0-40 degrees angle of attack.\nThese aerodynamic results differ by 15 percent from\nthe previously published data, and are being used in refined landing-footprint analyses to ensure a safe splashdown location, and to position the recovery ship for\nswifter capsule retrieval.\n\nSummary of Results\n\nReferences\n\nAn aerothermodynamic analysis of the Commercial Experiment Transporter (COMET) reentry capsule\nhas been performed using the Langley Aerothermodynamic Upwind Relaxation Algorithm. Steady-state laminar thin-layer Navier-Stokes and Euler flowfield solutions were obtained at eight trajectory points for Mach\nnumbers 1.5, 2.0, 5.1, 10.0, 15.1, 20.1, 25.4, and 27.5.\nAxisymmetric and 5, 10, and 20 degree angles of attack\nwere considered across the Mach-number range, with the\n\n\xe2\x80\x98F.
