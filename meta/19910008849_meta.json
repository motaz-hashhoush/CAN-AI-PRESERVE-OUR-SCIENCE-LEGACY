The Universities Space Research Association, in cooperation with NASA, is sponsoring an undergraduate program which is geared to designing an aircraft that can study the ozone layer at the equator. This aircraft must be able to cruise at 130,000 feet for six hours at Mach 0.7, while carrying 3,000 lbs. of payload. In addition, the aircraft must have a minimum range of 6,000 miles. In consideration of the novel nature of this project, the pilot must be able to take control in the event of unforeseen difficulties. Three aircraft configurations were determined to be the most suitable - a joined-wing, a biplane, and a twin-boom conventional airplane. The performance of each configuration was analyzed to investigate the feasibility of the project.", "title": "High altitude reconnaissance aircraft", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:16:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910008849, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yazdo, Renee Anna"}, "organization": {"name": "California State Polytechnic Univ.", "location": "Pomona, CA, United States"}}, "id": "9c8d45e479054807aebb87bf9ccea212"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910008849, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Moller, David"}, "organization": {"name": "California State Polytechnic Univ.", "location": "Pomona, CA, United States"}}, "id": "1c3ae6723b564759b547b75a55b6a9cf"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910008849, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910008849, "id": "4058bade51ae4933a885efbf631a587b", "publicationName": "USRA, Proceedings of the 6th Annual Summer Conference: NASA(USRA University Advanced Design Program", "publicationDate": "1990-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910008849.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910008849/downloads/19910008849.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910008849/downloads/19910008849.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910008849/downloads/19910008849.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
