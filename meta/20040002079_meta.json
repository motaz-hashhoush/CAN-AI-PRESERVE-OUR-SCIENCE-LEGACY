Procter & Gamble hired me in the early 1990's as a management consultant. I participated in training programs, procedural reviews, and the like-but I wasn't satisfied with these traditional approaches. I sought to inspire significant change in the way that project practitioners approached their work, and I thought I had found the right vehicle: stories. I wanted to collect the stories of some of the most successful project managers and share them with others in the company. First, I found a sponsor with enough vision to support my idea, and then I assembled a team of eight highly successful project managers who were willing to examine the idea of writing stories about their project work. My long-term goal was to collect their stories in a full-length book.", "title": "Small Wins", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T15:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20040002079, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Laufer, Alexander"}, "organization": {"name": "Maryland Univ.", "location": "College Park, MD, United States"}}, "id": "95bc28c1806241ae8b3786901f6815c7"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-03-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20040002079, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040002079, "issue": "15", "id": "a99cd9c2d0eb463f96c861d654d99032", "publicationName": "ASK Magazine", "publicationDate": "2003-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040002079.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040002079/downloads/20040002079.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040002079/downloads/20040002079.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040002079/downloads/20040002079.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
