Up\nuntil now, these types of sophisticated\ntools have been developed in isolation\nby national agencies, academic institutions, and research organizations. By\nproviding an open-source solution to\nanalyze and visualize weather, climate,\nand agricultural data, the scientific and\nresearch communities can more readily\nadvance solutions needed to understand better the dynamics of our home\nplanet, Earth.\niGlobe provides a flexible interface\nfor sophisticated analysis and highly interactive visualization of NetCDF (Network Common Data Format) data.\nNetCDF, the data format typically used\n\nfor weather and climate data, is large\nand complex in nature. Even the simple\nact of accessing NetCDF data is a computation- and data-storage-intensive undertaking. iGlobe is there for the international community to advance collectively\nsolutions that address issues of concern\nto all.\niGlobe is a 4D virtual globe application\nusing NASA World Wind visualization\ntechnology\n(www.goworldwind.org).\niGlobe integrates analysis of climate\nmodel outputs and remote sensing observations, combined with demographic\nand environmental data sets, to understand global and regional phenomena\nbetter, and provides impact analysis on a\ncritical national resource, our agricultural industry. iGlobe allows seamless access to remote data repositories, allows\nusers to run sophisticated data analysis\n\nalgorithms on the server side, and provides accelerated statistical analysis on\nthe client side via a thin client analytic\nengine able to incorporate server-side\nprocessing power.\niGlobe server-side analysis provides\nsupport for different data analysis algorithms purposed to identify patterns in\nspatial-temporal data, i.e., change detection, anomaly detection, clustering, and\nfrequent-pattern analysis. The iGlobe\nclient-side analysis also provides support\nfor statistical operations on selected regions using any number of spatial-temporal data layers and parameters, i.e.,\nspatial mean, median, variance, autocorrelation, etc.\nThis work was done by Patrick Hogan of\nAmes Research Center.

ARC-151661A\n\nBroad-Bandwidth FPGA-Based Digital Polyphase Spectrometer\nApplications include microwave radiometers, laser heterodyne systems, and radar.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nWith present concern for ecological\nsustainability ever increasing, it is desirable to model the composition of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nupper atmosphere accurately with regards to certain helpful and harmful\nchemicals, such as greenhouse gases and\nozone. The microwave limb sounder\n(MLS) is an instrument designed to map\nthe global day-to-day concentrations of\nkey atmospheric constituents continuously. One important component in\nMLS is the spectrometer, which\nprocesses the raw data provided by the\nreceivers into frequency-domain information that cannot only be transmitted\nmore efficiently, but also processed directly once received. The present-generation spectrometer is fully analog. The\ngoal is to include a fully digital spectrometer in the next-generation sensor. In a\ndigital spectrometer, incoming analog\ndata must be converted into a digital format, processed through a Fourier transform, and finally accumulated to reduce\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nthe impact of input noise. While the final\ndesign will be placed on an application\nspecific integrated circuit (ASIC), the\nbuilding of these chips is prohibitively\nexpensive. To that end, this design was\nconstructed on a field-programmable\ngate array (FPGA).\nA family of state-of-the-art digital\nFourier transform spectrometers has\nbeen developed, with a combination of\nhigh bandwidth and fine resolution.\nAnalog signals consisting of radiation\nemitted by constituents in planetary atmospheres or galactic sources are downconverted and subsequently digitized by\na pair of interleaved analog-to-digital\nconverters (ADCs). This 6-Gsps (gigasample per second) digital representation of the analog signal is then\nprocessed through an FPGA-based\nstreaming fast Fourier transform (FFT).\nDigital spectrometers have many advantages over previously used analog spectrometers, especially in terms of accu-\n\nracy and resolution, both of which are\nparticularly important for the type of scientific questions to be addressed with\nnext-generation radiometers.\nThe high-level building blocks (filter\nand FFT components) were optimized\nfor the Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA, and for interfacing with one another. The design,\nfrom building blocks to complete implementation, was floor-planned in order\nto make efficient use of the FPGA resources. As more aggressive spectrometer designs were created, designing the\nhardware to run at a sufficiently high\nclock rate became progressively more\ndifficult. These issues were mitigated by\nduplicating hardware and adding (or\nremoving) latency as necessary. The\nfloor-planning of the design was\nchanged dramatically from the original.\nThe final spectrometer design is an\n8192-channel implementation. Designed with additional output capacity,\nthe spectrometer has superior fre-\n\n5\n\n1014\n1013\n1012\n1011\n1010\n109\n108\n107\n2.31\n\n2.32\n\n2.33\n\n2.34\n\n2.35\n\n2.36\n\nMeasured Channel Frequency Response From 8192 Channel Spectrometer\n\nThe measured channel frequency response from the 8192-channel Spectrometer.\n\nquency resolution, dynamic range, and\naccumulation length when compared to\nprevious versions. An alternate, dual-polarization, 1.5-GHz, 4096-channel spec-\n\ntrometer is available as well. Both designs are capable of accumulating for\nhours, several orders of magnitude over\nwhat is required.\n\nIn addition, a further improved spectrometer with double the frequency resolution, a polyphase-FIR filter front end,\nand substantially reduced noise has been\nsuccessfully simulated and is presently in\nthe final stages of development. When\nfinished, it will offer a spectrometer developed on Virtex-5 hardware with bandwidth and spectral resolution an order of\nmagnitude greater than the analog spectrometers presently in use.\nPlans to make an 8-GHz spectrometer\ntaking advantage of the same technology\nused for this device are already being\nmade. Finally, efforts are presently being\nmade to interface this design to a compact Nallatech board, which consumes\nless power and can be more readily used\nin remote locations and demanding environments.\nThis work was done by Robert F.

NPO-48352\n\nSmall Aircraft Data Distribution System\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThe CARVE Small Aircraft Data Distribution System acquires the aircraft location and attitude data that is required\nby the various programs running on a\ndistributed network. This system distributes the data it acquires to the data acquisition programs for inclusion in their\ndata files.\nIt uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to broadcast data over a LAN\n(Local Area Network) to any programs\nthat might have a use for the data. The\nprogram is easily adaptable to acquire\nadditional data and log that data to disk.\n\nThe current version also drives displays\nusing precision pitch and roll information to aid the pilot in maintaining a\nlevel-level attitude for radar/radiometer\nmapping beyond the degree available\nby flying visually or using a standard\ngyro-driven attitude indicator.\nThe software is designed to acquire an\narray of data to help the mission manager make real-time decisions as to the\neffectiveness of the flight. This data is\ndisplayed for the mission manager and\nbroadcast to the other experiments on\nthe aircraft for inclusion in their data\n\nfiles. The program also drives real-time\nprecision pitch and roll displays for the\npilot and copilot to aid them in maintaining the desired attitude, when required, during data acquisition on mapping lines.\nThis work was done by Seth L.

Refer to NPO-48384.\n\nEarth Science Datacasting v2.0\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThe Datacasting software, which consists of a server and a client, has been developed as part of the Earth Science\n(ES) Datacasting project. The goal of ES\nDatacasting is to provide scientists the\nability to automatically and continuously\ndownload Earth science data that meets\na precise, predefined need, and then to\ninstantaneously visualize it on a local\ncomputer. This is achieved by applying\n\n6\n\nthe concept of podcasting to deliver science data over the Internet using RSS\n(Really Simple Syndication) XML feeds.\nBy extending the RSS specification, scientists can filter a feed and only download the files that are required for a particular application (for example, only\nfiles that contain information about a\nparticular event, such as a hurricane or\nflood). The extension also provides the\n\nability for the client to understand the\nformat of the data and visualize the information locally.\nThe server part enables a data\nprovider to create and serve basic\nDatacasting (RSS-based) feeds. The\nuser can subscribe to any number of\nfeeds, view the information related to\neach item contained within a feed\n(including browse pre-made images),\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nmanually download files associated\nwith items, and place these files in a\nlocal store.\nThe client-server architecture enables\nusers to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Subscribe and interpret multiple Datacasting feeds (same look and feel as a\ntypical mail client),\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Maintain a list of all items within each\nfeed,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Enable filtering on the lists based on\ndifferent metadata attributes contained within the feed (list will reference only data files of interest),\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Visualize the reference data and associated metadata,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Download files referenced within the\nlist, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Automatically download files as new\nitems become available.\n\nThis work was done by Andrew W.

Refer to NPO-47725.\n\nAlgorithm for Compressing Time-Series Data\nThis algorithm is generally applicable to many types of data.\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nAn algorithm based on Chebyshev\npolynomials effects lossy compression of\ntime-series data or other one-dimensional data streams (e.g., spectral data)\nthat are arranged in blocks for sequential transmission. The algorithm was developed for use in transmitting data\nfrom spacecraft scientific instruments to\nEarth stations. In spite of its lossy nature, the algorithm preserves the information needed for scientific analysis.\nThe algorithm is computationally simple, yet compresses data streams by factors much greater than two. The algorithm is not restricted to spacecraft or\nscientific uses: it is applicable to time-series data in general. The algorithm can\nalso be applied to general multidimensional data that have been converted to\ntime-series data, a typical example being\nimage data acquired by raster scanning.\nHowever, unlike most prior image-datacompression algorithms, this algorithm\nneither depends on nor exploits the\ntwo-dimensional spatial correlations\nthat are generally present in images.\nIn order to understand the essence of\nthis compression algorithm, it is necessary to understand that the net effect of\nthis algorithm and the associated decompression algorithm is to approximate the original stream of data as a sequence of finite series of Chebyshev\npolynomials. For the purpose of this algorithm, a block of data or interval of\ntime for which a Chebyshev polynomial\nseries is fitted to the original data is denoted a fitting interval. Chebyshev approximation has two properties that\nmake it particularly effective for compressing serial data streams with minimal loss of scientific information: The\nerrors associated with a Chebyshev approximation are nearly uniformly distributed over the fitting interval (this is\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nSplit input data into blocks.\n\nApply the Chebyshev transform on\nthe first or next data block, resulting\nin matrix of Chebyshev coefficients.\n\nPerform thresholding on the matrix\nof coefficients.\n\nQuantize the retained coefficients.\n\nCreate the control word for the\nretained, quantized coefficients.\n\nLosslessly compress the control word.\n\nYes\n\nAre there\nadditional data\nblocks?\n\nNo\nTransmit the compressed, retained\ncoefficients with their control words.\n\nStop\n\nChebyshev Transforms are calculated in this algorithm, which effects lossy compression of\ndata. Parameters of the algorithm can be adjusted to balance accuracy versus degree of compression.\n\nknown in the art as the \xe2\x80\x9cequal error\nproperty\xe2\x80\x9d); and the maximum deviations of the fitted Chebyshev polynomial\nfrom the original data have the smallest\npossible values (this is known in the art\nas the \xe2\x80\x9cmin-max property\xe2\x80\x9d).\nThe algorithm performs the same sequence of calculations on each successive\ndata block (see figure). For each block,\nthe first step is a calculation of a Chebyshev transform; that is, a matrix of coefficients of a Chebyshev series. This involves\ncalculation of linear combinations of data\nsamples with the applicable Chebyshev\ncoefficients. The Chebyshev coefficients\nare fixed and known, making it possible\nto reduce the computational burden by\ncomputing them in advance, storing\nthem in lookup tables, and retrieving\nthem from the lookup tables as needed.\nIn the next step, the matrix of coefficients is thresholded: only those coefficients larger than a threshold specified by\nthe user are retained. The retained coefficients are then quantized to reduce\ntheir representations to no more than a\nnumber of bits specified by the user.\nNext, there is generated a bit-control\nword, which is to be used during the subsequent decompression process to indicate the locations for insertion of the\nquantized retained coefficients and for\ninsertion of place holders (zeroes) at locations of coefficients that are not retained. The bit-control word is then encoded by a lossless compression\ntechnique; this step can significantly increase the overall compression ratio\nwithout introducing additional loss. If\nthere are more data blocks to be\nprocessed, then the process as described\nthus far is repeated for the next block. If\nthere are no more blocks to be\nprocessed, the compressed data and\ntheir control words are transmitted.\n\n7\n\nThe results obtained by use of the algorithm depend partly on three parameters: the block size (the number of data\nsamples in a block), the aforementioned\nthreshold value, and the aforementioned\nnumber of quantization bits. By adjusting\nthe values of these parameters for different types of data, one can obtain usefully\nlarge compression ratios with minimal er-\n\nrors. Higher threshold values always result in greater compression ratios at the\nexpense of quality of reconstructed signals. Increasing numbers of quantization\nbits generally reduces compression ratios\nbut yields reconstructed signals of higher\nquality. Increasing block sizes yields\nmore-varied results; in general, larger\ncompression ratios are associated with\n\nlarger blocks because fewer block maxima and minima are stored.\nThis work was done by S.

GSC-14820-1\n\nOnboard Science and Applications Algorithm for\nHyperspectral Data Reduction\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nAn onboard processing mission concept is under development for a possible\nDirect Broadcast capability for the\nHyspIRI mission, a Hyperspectral remote sensing mission under consideration for launch in the next decade. The\nconcept would intelligently spectrally\nand spatially subsample the data as well\nas generate science products onboard to\nenable return of key rapid response science and applications information despite limited downlink bandwidth. This\nrapid data delivery concept focuses on\nwildfires and volcanoes as primary applications, but also has applications to vegetation, coastal flooding, dust, and\nsnow/ice applications.\nOperationally, the HyspIRI team\nwould define a set of spatial regions of\ninterest where specific algorithms would\nbe executed. For example, known\n\ncoastal areas would have certain products or bands downlinked, ocean areas\nmight have other bands downlinked,\nand during fire seasons other areas\nwould be processed for active fire detections. Ground operations would automatically generate the mission plans\nspecifying the highest priority tasks executable within onboard computation,\nsetup, and data downlink constraints.\nThe spectral bands of the TIR (thermal infrared) instrument can accurately\ndetect the thermal signature of fires and\nsend down alerts, as well as the thermal\nand VSWIR (visible to short-wave infrared) data corresponding to the active\nfires. Active volcanism also produces a\ndistinctive thermal signature that can be\ndetected onboard to enable spatial subsampling. Onboard algorithms and\nground-based algorithms suitable for on-\n\nboard deployment are mature. On\nHyspIRI, the algorithm would perform a\ntable-driven temperature inversion from\nseveral spectral TIR bands, and then\ntrigger downlink of the entire spectrum\nfor each of the hot pixels identified.\nOcean and coastal applications include\nsea surface temperature (using a small\nspectral subset of TIR data, but requiring\nconsiderable ancillary data), and ocean\ncolor applications to track biological activity such as harmful algal blooms. Measuring surface water extent to track flooding is another rapid response product\nleveraging VSWIR spectral information.\nThis work was done by Steve A. Chien,\nAshley G. Davies, and Dorothy Silverman of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Daniel Mandl of Goddard Space\nFlight Center. For more information, contact\niaoffice@jpl.nasa.gov. NPO-47471\n\nSampling Technique for Robust Odorant Detection Based on\nMIT RealNose Data\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThis technique enhances the detection capability of the autonomous RealNose system from MIT to detect odorants and their concentrations in noisy\nand transient environments. The lowcost, portable system with low power\nconsumption will operate at high speed\nand is suited for unmanned and remotely operated long-life applications.\nA deterministic mathematical model\nwas developed to detect odorants and\ncalculate their concentration in noisy\nenvironments. Real data from MIT\xe2\x80\x99s\nNanoNose was examined, from which a\nsignal conditioning technique was proposed to enable robust odorant detec-\n\n8\n\ntion for the RealNose system. Its sensitivity can reach to sub-part-per-billion\n(sub-ppb).\nA Space Invariant Independent Component Analysis (SPICA) algorithm was\ndeveloped to deal with non-linear mixing that is an over-complete case, and it\nis used as a preprocessing step to recover\nthe original odorant sources for detection. This approach, combined with the\nCascade Error Projection (CEP) Neural\nNetwork algorithm, was used to perform\nodorant identification.\nSignal conditioning is used to identify\npotential processing windows to enable\nrobust detection for autonomous systems.\n\nSo far, the software has been developed\nand evaluated with current data sets provided by the MIT team. However, continuous data streams are made available\nwhere even the occurrence of a new odorant is unannounced and needs to be noticed by the system autonomously before\nits unambiguous detection. The challenge for the software is to be able to separate the potential valid signal from the\nodorant and from the noisy transition region when the odorant is just introduced.\nThis work was done by Tuan A. Duong of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor more information, contact iaoffice@\njpl.nasa.gov. NPO-47488\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nSecurity Data Warehouse Application\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe Security Data Warehouse (SDW)\nis used to aggregate and correlate all JSC\nIT security data. This includes IT asset\ninventory such as operating systems and\npatch levels, users, user logins, remote\naccess dial-in and VPN, and vulnerability\ntracking and reporting. The correlation\nof this data allows for an integrated understanding of current security issues\nand systems by providing this data in a\nformat that associates it to an individual\nhost. The cornerstone of the SDW is its\nunique host-mapping algorithm that has\nundergone extensive field tests, and provides a high degree of accuracy.\nThe algorithm comprises two parts.\nThe first part employs fuzzy logic to derive a best-guess host assignment using\nincomplete sensor data. The second\npart is logic to identify and correct errors in the database, based on subse-\n\nquent, more complete data. Host\nrecords are automatically split or\nmerged, as appropriate.\nThe process had to be refined and\nthoroughly tested before the SDW deployment was feasible. Complexity was\nincreased by adding the dimension of\ntime. The SDW correlates all data with\nits relationship to time. This lends support to forensic investigations, audits,\nand overall situational awareness.\nAnother important feature of the\nSDW architecture is that all of the underlying complexities of the data\nmodel and host-mapping algorithm are\nencapsulated in an easy-to-use and understandable Perl language Appli cation Programming Interface (API).\nThis allows the SDW to be quickly augmented with additional sensors using\nminimal coding and testing. It also sup-\n\nports rapid generation of ad hoc reports and integration with other information systems.\nThis work was done by Lynn R.

The device consumes low power and has a low\nfabrication cost. This device utilizes a\nPlug-and-Play concept, and can be integrated into intra-satellite networks, supporting SpaceWire and Gigabit Ethernet\nI/O. A space-qualified, 100-pin package\nalso was developed, allowing space-qualified (class K) transponders to be delivered within a six-month time frame.\nThe novel, optical, radiation-tolerant\ntransponder was implemented as a\nstandalone board, containing the\ntransponder ASIC (application specific\nintegrated circuit) and optical module,\nwith an FPGA (field-programmable gate\narray) friendly parallel interface. It features improved radiation tolerance;\nhigh-data-rate, low-power consumption;\nand advanced functionality. The\ntransponder utilizes a patented currentmode logic library of radiation-hardened-by-architecture cells. The transpon-\n\nder was developed, fabricated, and radhard tested up to 1 MRad. It was fabricated using 90-nm CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) 9 SF\nprocess from IBM, and incorporates full\nBIT circuitry, allowing a loop back test.\nThe low-speed parallel LVCMOS (lowvoltage complementary metal oxide\nsemiconductor) bus is compatible with\nActel FPGA. The output LVDS (low-voltage differential signaling) interface operates up to 1.5 Gb/s. Built-in CDR\n(clock-data recovery) circuitry provides\nrobust synchronization and incorporates two alarm signals such as synch loss\nand signal loss. The ultra-linear peak detector scheme allows on-line control of\nthe amplitude of the input signal. Power\nconsumption is less than 300 mW.\nThe developed transponder with a\n1.25 Gb/s serial data rate incorporates a\n10-to-1 serializer with an internal clock\nmultiplication unit and a 10-1 deserializer with internal clock and data recovery block, which can operate with 8B10B\n\nencoded signals. Three loop-back test\nmodes are provided to facilitate the\nbuilt-in-test functionality. The design is\nbased on a proprietary library of differential current switching logic cells implemented in the standard 90-nm\nCMOS 9SF technology from IBM. The\nproprietary low-power LVDS physical interface is fully compatible with the\nSpaceWire standard, and can be directly\nconnected to the SFP MSA (small form\nfactor pluggable Multiple Source Agreement) optical transponder. The lowspeed parallel interfaces are fully compatible with the standard 1.8 V CMOS\ninput/output devices. The utilized proprietary annular CMOS layout structures\nprovide TID tolerance above 1.2 MRad.\nThe complete chip consumes less than\n150 mW of power from a single 1.8-V\npositive supply source.\nThis work was done by Vladimir Katzman of Adsantec for Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.

Lossless\ncompression is important for signature\nextraction, object recognition, and feature classification capabilities. To provide onboard data compression, a hardware implementation of a lossless\nhyperspectral compression algorithm\nwas developed using a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The underlying\nalgorithm is the Fast Lossless (FL) com-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\npression algorithm reported in \xe2\x80\x9cFast\nLossless Compression of MultispectralImage Data\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-42517), NASA Tech\nBriefs, Vol. 30, No. 8 (August 2006), p. 26\nwith the modification reported in \xe2\x80\x9cLossless, Multi-Spectral Data Comressor for\nImproved Compression for PushbroomType Instruments\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-45473), NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 32, No. 7 (July 2008) p.\n63, which provides improved compression performance for data from pushbroom-type imagers. An FPGA implementation of the unmodified FL\nalgorithm was previously developed and\nreported in \xe2\x80\x9cFast and Adaptive Lossless\n\nOnboard Hyperspectral Data Compression System\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-46867), NASA Tech\nBriefs, Vol. 36, No. 5 (May 2012) p. 42.\nThe essence of the FL algorithm is adaptive linear predictive compression using\nthe sign algorithm for filter adaption.\nThe FL compressor achieves a combination of low complexity and compression\neffectiveness that exceeds that of stateof-the-art techniques currently in use.\nThe modification changes the predictor\nstructure to tolerate differences in sensitivity of different detector elements, as\noccurs in pushbroom-type imagers,\nwhich are suitable for spacecraft use.\n\n11\n\nThe FPGA implementation offers a\nlow-cost, flexible solution compared to\ntraditional ASIC (application specific\nintegrated circuit) and can be integrated as an intellectual property (IP)\nfor part of, e.g., a design that manages\nthe instrument interface. The FPGA implementation was benchmarked on the\nXilinx Virtex IV LX25 device, and\nported to a Xilinx prototype board. The\n\ncurrent implementation has a critical\npath of 29.5 ns, which dictated a clock\nspeed of 33 MHz. The critical path delay\nis end-to-end measurement between the\nuncompressed input data and the output compression data stream. The implementation compresses one sample\nevery clock cycle, which results in a\nspeed of 33 Msample/s. The implementation has a rather low device use of the\n\nXilinx Virtex IV LX25, making the total\npower consumption of the implementation about 1.27 W.\nThis work was done by Didier Keymeulen,\nNazeeh I.

NPO-47103\n\nHigh-Voltage, Low-Power BNC Feedthrough Terminator\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nThis innovation is a high-voltage, lowpower BNC (Bayonet Neill\xe2\x80\x93Concelman)\nfeedthrough that enables the user to terminate an instrumentation cable properly while connected to a high voltage,\nwithout the use of a voltage divider. This\nfeedthrough is low power, which will not\nload the source, and will properly terminate the instrumentation cable to the instrumentation, even if the cable impedance is not constant.\nThe Space Shuttle Program had a requirement to measure voltage transients\non the orbiter bus through the Ground\nLightning Measurement System (GLMS).\nThis measurement has a bandwidth requirement of 1 MHz. The GLMS voltage\nmeasurement is connected to the or-\n\nbiter through a DC panel. The DC panel\nis connected to the bus through a nonuniform cable that is approximately 75 ft\n(\xe2\x89\x8823 m) long. A 15-ft (\xe2\x89\x885-m), 50-ohm triaxial cable is connected between the DC\npanel and the digitizer. Based on calculations and simulations, cable resonances and reflections due to mismatched impedances of the cable\nconnecting the orbiter bus and the digitizer causes the output not to reflect accurately what is on the bus. A voltage divider at the DC panel, and terminating\nthe 50-ohm cable properly, would eliminate this issue. Due to implementation\nissues, an alternative design was needed\nto terminate the cable properly without\nthe use of a voltage divider.\n\nAnalysis shows how the cable resonances and reflections due to the mismatched impedances of the cable\nconnecting the orbiter bus and the digitizer causes the output not to reflect accurately what is on the bus. After simulating a dampening circuit located at the\ndigitizer, simulations were performed to\nshow how the cable resonances were\ndampened and the accuracy was improved significantly. Test cables built to\nverify simulations were accurate. Since\nthe dampening circuit is low power, it\ncan be packaged in a BNC feedthrough.\nThis work was done by Douglas (Doug)\nBearden of Kennedy Space Center.

KSC-13560\n\nSpaceCube Mini\nA unit that is being designed will be a very compact and low-power system.\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nThis version of the SpaceCube will\nbe a full-fledged, onboard space processing system capable of 2500+ MIPS,\nand featuring a number of plug-andplay gigabit and standard interfaces, all\nin a condensed 3\xc3\x973\xc3\x973 form factor [<10\nwatts and < 3 lb (\xe2\x89\x881.4 kg)]. The main\nprocessing engine is the Xilinx SIRF radiation-hardened-by-design Virtex-5\nFX-130T field-programmable gate\narray (FPGA).\nEven as the SpaceCube 2.0 version\n(currently under test) is being targeted\nas the platform of choice for a number\nof the upcoming Earth Science Decadal\nSurvey missions, GSFC has been contacted by customers who wish to see a\nsystem that incorporates key features of\nthe version 2.0 architecture in an even\nsmaller form factor. In order to fulfill\n\n12\n\nthat need, the SpaceCube Mini is being\ndesigned, and will be a very compact and\nlow-power system. A similar flight system\nwith this combination of small size, low\npower, low cost, adaptability, and extremely high processing power does not\notherwise exist, and the SpaceCube Mini\nwill be of tremendous benefit to GSFC\nand its partners.\nThe SpaceCube Mini will utilize\nspace-grade components. The primary\nprocessing engine of the Mini is the Xilinx Virtex-5 SIRF FX-130T radiationhardened-by-design FPGA for critical\nflight applications in high-radiation environments. The Mini can also be\nequipped with a commercial Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA with integrated PowerPCs\nfor a low-cost, high-power computing\nplatform for use in the relatively radia-\n\ntion-benign LEOs (low-Earth orbits). In\neither case, this version of the SpaceCube will weigh less than 3 pounds\n(\xe2\x89\x881.4 kg), conform to the CubeSat\nform-factor (10\xc3\x9710\xc3\x9710 cm), and will be\nlow power (<10 watts for typical applications). The SpaceCube Mini will have a\nradiation-hardened Aeroflex FPGA for\nconfiguring and scrubbing the Xilinx\nFPGA by utilizing the onboard FLASH\nmemory to store the configuration files.\nThe FLASH memory will also be used\nfor storing algorithm and application\ncode for the PowerPCs and the Xilinx\nFPGA. In addition, it will feature highspeed DDR SDRAM (double data rate\nsynchronous dynamic random-access\nmemory) to store the instructions and\ndata of active applications. This version\nwill also feature SATA-II and Gigabit\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nEthernet interfaces. Furthermore, there\nwill also be general-purpose, multi-gigabit interfaces. In addition, the system\nwill have dozens of transceivers that can\nsupport LVDS (low-voltage differential\nsignaling), RS-422, or SpaceWire. The\nSpaceCube Mini includes an I/O card\nthat can be customized to meet the\nneeds of each mission. This version of\nthe SpaceCube will be designed so that\nmultiple Minis can be networked to-\n\ngether using SpaceWire, Ethernet, or\neven a custom protocol.\nScalability can be provided by networking multiple SpaceCube Minis together. Rigid-Flex technology is being\ntargeted for the construction of the\nSpaceCube Mini, which will make the\nextremely compact and low-weight design feasible. The SpaceCube Mini is designed to fit in the compact CubeSat\nform factor, thus allowing deployment in\n\na new class of missions that the previous\nSpaceCube versions were not suited for.\nAt the time of this reporting, engineering units should be available in the summer 2012.\nThis work was done by Michael Lin,\nDavid Petrick, Alessandro Geist, and\nThomas Flatley of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.

GSC-16223-1\n\nDichroic Filter for Separating W-Band and Ka-Band\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThe proposed Aerosol/Cloud/Ecosystems (ACEs) mission development\nwould advance cloud profiling radar\nfrom that used in CloudSat by adding a\n35-GHz (Ka-band) channel to the 94-GHz\n(W-band) channel used in CloudSat. In\norder to illuminate a single antenna, and\nuse CloudSat-like quasi-optical transmission lines, a spatial diplexer is needed to\nadd the Ka-band channel.\nA dichroic filter separates Ka-band from\nW-band by employing advances in electrical discharge machining (EDM) and\nmode-matching analysis techniques developed and validated for designing dichroics\nfor the Deep Space Network (DSN), to develop a preliminary design that both met\nthe requirements of frequency separation\nand mechanical strength.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nFirst, a mechanical prototype was built\nusing an approximately 102-micron-diameter EDM process, and tolerances of\nthe hole dimensions, wall thickness, radius, and dichroic filter thickness measured. The prototype validated the manufacturing needed to design a dichroic\nfilter for a higher-frequency usage than\npreviously used in the DSN. The initial\ndesign was based on a Ka-band design,\nbut thicker walls are required for mechanical rigidity than one obtains by\nsimply scaling the Ka-band dichroic filter. The resulting trade of hole dimensions for mechanical rigidity (wall thickness) required electrical redesign of the\nhole dimensions. Updates to existing\ncodes in the linear solver decreased the\nanalysis time using mode-matching, en-\n\nabling the electrical design to be realized quickly.\nThis work is applicable to missions\nand instruments that seek to extend\nW-band cloud profiling measurements to other frequencies. By demonstrating a dichroic filter that passes\nW-band, but reflects a lower frequency,\nthis opens up the development of instruments that both compare to and\nenhance CloudSat.\nThis work was done by Larry W.

It was developed for 1-meter\nclass powered mirrors for astronomical\npurposes, but is extensible to other\ngeometries. The package accepts finite\nelement model (FEM) inputs and laboratory measured data for large opticalquality mirrors with active figure control.\nIt computes phenomenological contributions to the surface figure error using\nseveral built-in optimization techniques.\nThese phenomena include stresses induced in the mirror by the manufacturing process and the support structure,\nthe test procedure, high spatial frequency errors introduced by the polishing process, and other process-dependent deleterious effects due to\nlight-weighting of the mirror. Then, depending on the maturity of the mirror, it\neither predicts the best surface figure\nerror that the mirror will attain, or it verifies that the requirements for the error\nsources have been met once the best surface figure error has been measured.\nThe unique feature of this software is\nthat it ties together physical phenomenology with wavefront sensing and control techniques and various optimization\nmethods including convex optimization,\nKalman filtering, and quadratic programming to both generate predictive\nmodels and to do requirements verification. This software combines three distinct disciplines: wavefront control, predictive models based on FEM, and\nrequirements verification using measured data in a robust, reusable code that\nis applicable to any large optics for\nground and space telescopes.\nThe software also includes state-of-theart wavefront control algorithms that\nallow closed-loop performance to be\ncomputed. It allows for quantitative\ntrade studies to be performed for optical\nsystems engineering, including computing the best surface figure error under\nvarious testing and operating conditions. After the mirror manufacturing\nprocess and testing have been completed, the software package can be used\nto verify that the underlying requirements have been met.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nThis work was done by Scott A.

This software was written expressly\nfor a multi-core system and can support\ndifferent kinds of fault strategies, such\nas introspection, algorithm-based fault\ntolerance (ABFT), and triple modular\nredundancy (TMR). It focuses on providing fault tolerance for the application code, and represents the first step\nin a plan to eventually include fault tolerance in message passing and the\nFTM itself.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nIn the multi-core system, the FTM resides on a single, dedicated core, separate from the cores used by the application. This is done in order to isolate the\nFTM from application faults and to\nallow it to swap out any application core\nfor a substitute. The structure of the\nFTM consists of an interface to a fault\ntolerant strategy module, a responder\nmodule, a fault manager module, an\nerror factory, and an error mapper that\ndetermines the severity of the error.\nIn the present reference implementation, the only fault tolerant strategy implemented is introspection. The introspection code waits for an application\nnode to send an error notification to it.\nIt then uses the error factory to create\nan error object, and at this time, a severity level is assigned to the error. The introspection code uses its built-in knowledge base to generate a recommended\nresponse to the error. Responses might\ninclude ignoring the error, logging it,\nrolling back the application to a previously saved checkpoint, swapping in a\nnew node to replace a bad one, or\nrestarting the application. The original\nerror and recommended response are\npassed to the top-level fault manager\nmodule, which invokes the response.\nThe responder module also notifies the\nintrospection module of the generated\nresponse. This provides additional information to the introspection module that\nit can use in generating its next response. For example, if the responder\ntriggers an application rollback and errors are still occurring, the introspection\nmodule may decide to recommend an\napplication restart.\nThis work was done by Raphael R.

Refer to NPO-47976.\n\nTrick Simulation\nEnvironment 07\nThe Trick Simulation Environment is\na generic simulation toolkit used for\nconstructing and running simulations.\nThis release includes a Monte Carlo\nanalysis simulation framework and a\ndata analysis package. It produces all\nauto documentation in XML. Also, the\nsoftware is capable of inserting a malfunction at any point during the simulation. Trick 07 adds variable server\noutput options and error messaging\nand is capable of using and manipulating wide characters for international\nsupport. Wide character strings are\navailable as a fundamental type for variables processed by Trick.\nA Trick Monte Carlo simulation uses\na statistically generated, or predetermined, set of inputs to iteratively drive\nthe simulation. Also, there is a framework in place for optimization and solution finding where developers may iteratively modify the inputs per run based\non some analysis of the outputs. The\ndata analysis package is capable of reading data from external simulation packages such as MATLAB and Octave, as\nwell as the common comma-separated\nvalues (CSV) format used by Excel,\nwithout the use of external converters.\nThe file formats for MATLAB and Octave were obtained from their documentation sets, and Trick maintains\ngeneric file readers for each format.\nXML tags store the fields in the Trick\nheader comments. For header files,\n\nXML tags for structures and enumerations, and the members within are\nstored in the auto documentation. For\nsource code files, XML tags for each\nfunction and the calling arguments are\nstored in the auto documentation.\nWhen a simulation is built, a top level\nXML file, which includes all of the\nheader and source code XML auto documentation files, is created in the simulation directory. Trick 07 provides an\nXML to TeX converter. The converter\nreads in header and source code XML\ndocumentation files and converts the\ndata to TeX labels and tables suitable for\ninclusion in TeX documents.\nA malfunction insertion capability\nallows users to override the value of\nany simulation variable, or call a malfunction job, at any time during the\nsimulation. Users may specify conditions, use the return value of a malfunction trigger job, or manually activate a malfunction. The malfunction\naction may consist of executing a block\nof input file statements in an action\nblock, setting simulation variable values, call a malfunction job, or turn\non/off simulation jobs.\nThe variable server output options\nand error messaging capabilities allow\nthe variable server to return data in a tab\ndelimited ASCII format, or in a recordbased binary format. The binary record\nincludes information about the type and\nsize of a variable not present in the\nASCII format. The binary option is capable of transmitting full C/C++ structures\nwith one request. With this option, error\nmessaging is returnable to client applications. In this software, the variable server\nmay also return time synchronous data,\nwhich is gathered and sent at the end of\nthe simulation frame to guarantee data\nconsistency. Also, the Trick 07 variable\nserver is capable of delivering the simulation data to multiple clients using multicast sockets. This allows multiple machines to receive the same data without\nincreasing the computational load on\nthe simulation.\nIn addition to Linux and MacOSX,\nTrick 07 now supports three real-time\noperating systems: QNX, LynxOS, and\nRedHawk Linux. Each RTOS has unique\nsystem calls accessing real-time features\nsuch as setting process priorities, processor assignment, and accessing the realtime clock. Trick uses the unique realtime features of each OS.\nThis work was done by Alexander S. Lin of\nJohnson Space Center and John M. Penn,\nDan A. Strauss, and Keith Vetter of L-3 Communications Corporation. Further informa-\n\n17\n\ntion is contained in a TSP (see page 1). MSC24492-1\n\nGeometric Reasoning for\nAutomated Planning\nAn important aspect of mission planning for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s operation of the International Space Station is the allocation and\nmanagement of space for supplies and\nequipment. The Stowage, Configuration\nAnalysis, and Operations Planning teams\ncollaborate to perform the bulk of that\nplanning. A Geometric Reasoning Engine\nis developed in a way that can be shared\nby the teams to optimize item placement\nin the context of crew planning.\nThe ISS crew spends (at the time of\nthis writing) a third or more of their\ntime moving supplies and equipment\naround. Better logistical support and optimized packing could make a significant impact on operational efficiency of\nthe ISS. Currently, computational geometry and motion planning do not focus\nspecifically on the optimized orientation\nand placement of 3D objects based on\nmultiple distance and containment preferences and constraints.\nThe software performs reasoning about\nthe manipulation of 3D solid models in\norder to maximize an objective function\nbased on distance. It optimizes for 3D orientation and placement. Spatial placement optimization is a general problem\nand can be applied to object packing or\nasset relocation.\nThis work was done by Bradley J.

This\ndetector exploits the fact that the color\nvariation across water bodies is generally\nlarger and more uniform than that of\nother naturally occurring types of terrain, such as soil and vegetation. Non-traversable water bodies, such as large puddles, ponds, and lakes, are detected\nbased on color variation, image intensity\nvariance, image intensity gradient, size,\nand shape.\nAt ranges beyond 20 meters, water\nbodies out in the open can be indirectly\ndetected by detecting reflections of the\nsky below the horizon in color imagery.\nBut at closer range, the color coming\nout of a water body dominates sky reflections, and the water cue from sky reflections is of marginal use. Since there\nmay be times during UGV autonomous\nnavigation when a water body does not\ncome into a perception system\xe2\x80\x99s field of\nview until it is at close range, the ability\nto detect water bodies at close range is\ncritical. Factors that influence the perceived color of a water body at close\nrange are the amount and type of sediment in the water, the water\xe2\x80\x99s depth,\nand the angle of incidence to the water\nbody. Developing a single model of the\nmixture ratio of light reflected off the\nwater surface (to the camera) to light\ncoming out of the water body (to the\ncamera) for all water bodies would be\nfairly difficult. Instead, this software detects close water bodies based on local\n\nterrain features and the natural, uniform change in color that occurs across\nthe surface from the leading edge to the\ntrailing edge.\nFrom a water body\xe2\x80\x99s leading edge to\nthe trailing edge, brightness and saturation levels tend to increase, with saturation content changing at a faster rate\nthan the brightness content. For all the\npixels on a water body, a plot of brightness/saturation vs. incidence angle is\nfairly linear with high slope. Fortuitously, this slope tends to be higher for\nwater than other naturally occurring\nterrain. This phenomenology was exploited here to develop software that\ndetects water bodies at close range.\nFirst, candidate water regions are identified in image space by locating regions having low texture. Next, the\ncolor changes are evaluated across each\ncandidate water region to locate those\nconsistent with water. Finally, an ellipse\nfit is performed on remaining candidate water regions and size and aspect\nratio filtering is applied to prune regions that geometrically are not likely\nto be water.\nThis work was done by Arturo L. Rankin\nof Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

In\nspaceborne applications, this approach\nis problematic because a patch element\nsupported by a single, thin post is\nhighly susceptible to acoustic loads during launch.\nThe technology reported here uses a\nlarge-diameter center post as its supporting structure. The supporting structure\nallows for the fabrication of a sufficiently\nrigid antenna element that can survive\nlaunch loads. The post may be either\nhollow or solid, depending on fabrication approach and/or mass constraints.\nThe patch antenna element and support\npost are envisioned as being fabricated\n(milled) from a single piece of aluminum or other metal. Alternately, the\npatch plate and support column can be\nfabricated separately and then joined\nusing fasteners, adhesive, or welding.\nCasting and electroforming are also viable techniques for manufacturing the\nmetal patch part(s). The patch structure\nis then either bonded or fastened to the\n\nsupporting groundplane. Arrays of\npatch elements can be fabricated by attaching several structures to a common\ngroundplane/support structure.\nPatch antennas can be fed in a number\nof different ways; the current design is envisioned as being fed from a coaxial\nprobe, the connector of which is attached\nto the backside of a supporting groundplane. The probe can be either soldered\nto the patch or attached by means of a\nslip-fit connector assembly in the patch.\nThe latter approach provides stress relief\nfor the probe attachment during launch.\nThe thickness of the patch material, interconnect technique, and attachment\ntechnique will depend on individual mass\nand launch load requirements. Alternatively, techniques such as aperture coupling or proximity coupling could be\nused to feed the patch.\nThe all-metal design eliminates the\nuse of dielectric in patch substrate, making it suitable to environments with high\nelectrostatic discharge (ESD) susceptibility. Elimination of dielectric also\nmakes the tuning of the element largely\nindependent of material properties\n(principally permittivity) and eliminates\ndielectric losses, which become appreciable at high frequencies. This simplifies the design and modeling of the antenna element. Concurrence between\n\nmeasurements and modeling is thus\ndriven by the fidelity of the modeling\nsoftware and fabrication tolerances (as\nopposed to material properties). Additionally, the large central support column has been shown to increase the\nbandwidth of the element to 20% without significantly affecting the radiation\npattern performance. Typically, a\nstacked patch design is used to obtain an\nimpedance bandwidth of 20% or more.\nWhile the new technology was conceived\nfor the purpose of eliminating dielectric\nfrom the patch-radiating element, a\nlarge-diameter ground post could be\nadded to dielectric-based patch designs\nto increase bandwidth without having to\nadd extra radiating layers. The new design has good cross-polarization suppression (better than 50 dB) because of the\nsymmetry of the design.\nThis work was done by Neil F. Chamberlain, Richard E. Hodges, and Mark S. Zawadzki of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory. For more information, contact\niaoffice@jpl.nasa.gov.\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been filed.

SLIMS\ncan also accommodate multiple laser\nchannels covering a wide range of\nwavelengths, resulting in detection of\nmore chemicals of interest. The me-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nchanical design of the mirror cell allows for the large effective path length\nwithin a small footprint. The same design provides a robust structure that\nlends itself to being immune to some of\nthe alignment challenges that similar\ncells face.\nBy taking a hollow cylinder and by cutting an elliptically or spherically curved\n\nsurface into its inner wall, the basic\ngeometry of a reflecting ring is created.\nIf the curved, inner surface is diamondturned and highly polished, a surface\nthat is very highly reflective can be\nformed. The surface finish can be further improved by adding a thin chrome\nor gold film over the surface. This creates a high-quality, curved, mirrored sur-\n\n19\n\nface. A laser beam, which can be injected from a small bore hole in the wall\nof the cylinder, will be able to make\nmany low-loss bounces around the ring,\ncreating a large optical path length.\nThe reflecting ring operates on the\nsame principle as the Herriott cell. The\ndifference exists in the mirror that\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be optically aligned,\nand which has a relatively large, internal surface area that lends itself to either open air or evacuated spectroscopic measurements. This solid,\nspherical ring mirror removes the possi-\n\nbility of mirror misalignment caused by\nthermal expansion or vibrations, because there is only a single, solid reflecting surface. Benefits of the reflecting\nring come into play when size constraints reduce the size of the system,\nespecially for space missions in which\nmass is at a premium.\nThis work was done by David C.

Microelectromechanical system (MEMS)\ntechnology is used to fabricate the microshutter arrays.\nThe main feature of the microshutter\ndevice is to use a set of standard surface\nmicromachining processes for device\nfabrication. Electrostatic actuation is\n\n20\n\nused to eliminate the need for macromechanical magnet actuating components. A simplified electrostatic actuation with no macro components (e.g.\nmoving magnets) required for actuation\nand latching of the shutters will make\nthe microshutter arrays robust and less\nprone to mechanical failure. Smallersize individual arrays will help to increase the yield and thus reduce the cost\nand improve robustness of the fabrication process. Reducing the size of the individual shutter array to about one\nsquare inch and building the large-scale\nmosaics by tiling these smaller-size arrays\nwould further help to reduce the cost of\nthe device due to the higher yield of\nsmaller devices.\nThe LAMA development is based on\nprior experience acquired while devel-\n\noping microshutter arrays for the James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST), but it\nwill have different features. The LAMA\nmodular design permits large-format\nmosaicking to cover a field of view at\nleast 50 times larger than JWST MSA.\nThe LAMA electrostatic, instead of magnetic, actuation enables operation cycles\nat least 100 times faster and a mass significantly smaller compared to JWST\nMSA. Also, standard surface micromachining technology will simplify the fabrication process, increasing yield and reducing cost.\nThis work was done by Samuel Moseley,\nAlexander Kutyrev, Ari Brown, and Mary Li\nof Goddard Space Flight Center.

CO is an important analyte to be able to sense in human\nhabitats since it is a marker for both prefire detection and post-fire cleanup.\nThe need exists for a sensor that can be\nincorporated into an existing sensing\narray architecture. The CO sensor needs\nto be a low-power chemiresistor that operates at room temperature; the sensor\nfabrication techniques must be compatible with ceramic substrates. Early work on\nthe JPL ElectronicNose indicated that\nsome of the existing polymer-carbon\nblack sensors might be suitable. In addition, the CO sensor based on polypyrrole\nfunctionalized with iron porphyrin was\ndemonstrated to be a promising sensor\nthat could meet the requirements.\nFirst, pyrrole was polymerized in a\n\nferric chloride/iron porphyrin solution in methanol. The iron porphyrin\nis 5, 10, 15, 20-tetraphenyl-21H, 23Hporphine iron (III) chloride. This creates a polypyrrole that is functionalized\nwith the porphyrin. After synthesis, the\npolymer is dried in an oven. Sensors\nwere made from the functionalized\npolypyrrole by binding it with a small\namount of polyethylene oxide (600\nMW). This composite made films that\nwere too resistive to be measured in the\ndevice.\nSubsequently, carbon black was\nadded to the composite to bring the\nsensing film resistivity within a measurable range. A suspension was created in\nmethanol using the functionalized\npolypyrrole (90% by weight), polyethylene oxide (600,000 MW, 5% by\nweight), and carbon black (5% by\n\nweight). The sensing films were then\ndeposited, like the polymer-carbon\nblack sensors. After deposition, the\nsubstrates were dried in a vacuum oven\nfor four hours at 60 \xc2\xb0C. These sensors\nshowed good response to CO at concentrations over 100 ppm.\nWhile the sensor is based on a functionalized pyrrole, the actual composite is more robust and flexible. A polymer binder was added to help keep the\nsensor material from delaminating\nfrom the electrodes, and carbon was\nadded to improve the conductivity of\nthe material.\nThis work was done by Margie L.

Silicon,\nhowever, is not a good structural material for stray light components such as\ntubes, stops, and baffles. Titanium is a\ngood structural material and can tolerate the 700 \xc2\xb0C nanotube growth process.\nThe ability to grow carbon nanotubes\non a titanium substrate that are ten\ntimes blacker than the current NASA\nstate-of-the-art paints in the visible to\nnear infrared spectra has been achieved.\nThis innovation will allow significant improvement of stray light performance in\nscientific instruments or any other opti-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\ncal system. This innovation is a refinement of the utilization of multiwalled\ncarbon nanotubes for stray light suppression in spaceflight instruments. The\ninnovation is a process to make the surface darker and improve the adhesion to\nthe substrate, improving robustness for\nspaceflight use.\nBright objects such as clouds or ice\nscatter light off of instrument structures\nand components and make it difficult to\nsee dim objects in Earth observations. A\ndarker material to suppress this stray\nlight has multiple benefits to these observations, including enabling scientific\nobservations not currently possible, increasing observational efficiencies in\n\nhigh-contrast scenes, and simplifying instruments and lowering their cost by utilizing fewer stray light components and\nachieving equivalent performance.\nThe prior art was to use commercially\navailable black paint, which resulted in\napproximately 4% of the light being reflected (hemispherical reflectance or\ntotal integrated scatter, or TIS). Use of\nmultiwalled carbon nanotubes on titanium components such as baffles, entrance aperture, tubes, and stops, can\ndecrease this scattered light by a factor\nof ten per bounce over the 200-nm to\n2,500-nm wavelength range. This can\nimprove system stray light performance\nby orders of magnitude.\n\n21\n\nThe purpose of the innovation is to\nprovide an enhanced stray light control\ncapability by making a blacker surface\ntreatment for typical stray light control\ncomponents. Since baffles, stops, and\ntubes used in scientific observations\noften undergo loads such as vibration, it\nwas critical to develop this surface treatment on structural materials. The inno-\n\nvation is to optimize the carbon nanotube growth for titanium, which is a\nstrong, lightweight structural material\nsuitable for spaceflight use.\nThe titanium substrate carbon nanotubes are more robust than those grown\non silicon and allow for easier utilization. They are darker than current surface treatments over larger angles and\n\nlarger wavelength range. The primary\nadvantage of titanium substrate is that it\nis a good structural material, and not as\nbrittle as silicon.\nThis work was done by John Hagopian,\nStephanie Getty, and Manuel Quijada of\nGoddard Space Flight Center.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nBuilding on previous knowledge acquired through research on thin-film\nbatteries, three-dimensional (3D)\nporous macroscopic particles consisting\nof curved two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures of Si may bring unique advantages for Si anode technology. Prior\nwork on thin Si films showed that during\nLi insertion, large-area Si films mostly accommodate the volume changes via variation in thickness. Therefore, the\nchanges in the external surface area can\nfundamentally be minimized and thus,\nformation of a stable, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) should be easier to\nachieve. In contrast, Si nanoparticles expand uniformly in all dimensions and\nthus, their outer surface area (where SEI\nforms) changes dramatically during insertion/extraction of Si. The low elasticity of the SEI makes it difficult to achieve\nthe long-term stability under cycling\nload. Further, thin Si films have lower\nsurface area (for the same mass), in\ncomparison to Si nanoparticles, and better potential for achieving low irreversible capacity losses on the first and\nsubsequent cycles.\nThin Si films coated on porous 3D\nparticles composed of curved 2D\ngraphene sheets have been synthesized\nutilizing techniques that allow for tunable properties. Since graphene exhibits specific surface area up to 100\ntimes higher than carbon black or\ngraphite, the deposition of the same\nmass of Si on graphene is much faster\nin comparison \xe2\x80\x94 a factor which is important for practical applications. In\naddition, the distance between\ngraphene layers is tunable and variation in the thickness of the deposited Si\nfilm is feasible. Both of these character-\n\n22\n\nistics allow for optimization of the energy and power characteristics. Thicker\nfilms will allow higher capacity, but\nslower rate capabilities. Thinner films\nwill allow more rapid charging, or\nhigher power performance.\nIn this innovation, uniform deposition of Si and C layers on high-surface-\n\narea graphene produced granules with\nspecific surface area (SSA) of \xe2\x89\x88 5 m2g\xe2\x80\x931.\nThe over 100 times reduction in SSA of\nthe initial graphene material is important for high Coulombic efficiencies on\nthe first and subsequent cycles. Here,\nthe low surface area of the composite resulted in an average Coulombic effi-\n\nA schematic of C-Si-Graphene Composite Formation: (a) natural graphite is transformed to (b)\ngraphene, and then (c) coated by Si nanoparticles and (d) a thin C layer.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nciency in excess of 99%.

While only a Si-containing\ncomposite was demonstrated, the synthesis techniques utilized are applicable\n\nfor other high-capacity materials that\ncan be conformally coated on graphene.\nSimilarly, while only curved graphene\nwas used as a substrate for Si deposition,\nother curved, thin, 2D substrates (which\ndo not react with Si precursors) may be\nused for conformal coating by Si or\nother high-capacity materials.\nThis work was performed by Gleb Yushin,\nKara Evanoff, and Alexander Magasinski of\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology for Glenn Research Center.

However,\nsuch materials are not truly black and\nhave poor absorption characteristics at\nlonger wavelengths. The blackness of\nsuch coatings is important to increase\nthe accuracy of calibration targets used\nin radiometric imaging spectrometers\nsince blackbody cavities are prohibitively\nlarge in size. Such coatings are also useful potentially for thermal detectors,\nwhere a broadband absorber is desired.\nAu-black has been a commonly used\nbroadband optical absorber, but it is very\nfragile and can easily be damaged by\nheat and mechanical vibration. An optically efficient, thermally rugged absorber could also be beneficial for thermal solar cell applications for energy\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nharnessing, particularly in the 350\xe2\x80\x932,500\nnm spectral window.\nIt has been demonstrated that arrays\nof vertically oriented carbon nanotubes\n(CNTs), specifically multi-walled-carbon-nanotubes (MWCNTs), are an exceptional optical absorber over a broad\nrange of wavelengths well into the infrared (IR). The reflectance of such arrays is 100\xc3\x97 lower compared to conventional black materials, such as Au black\nin the spectral window of 350\xe2\x80\x932,500\nnm. Total hemispherical measurements revealed a reflectance of \xe2\x89\x881.7 %\nat \xce\xbb \xe2\x89\x881 \xce\xbcm, and at longer wavelengths\ninto the infrared (IR), the specular reflectance was \xe2\x89\x882.4 % at \xce\xbb \xe2\x89\x887 \xce\xbcm.\nThe previously synthesized CNTs for\noptical absorber applications were\nformed using water-assisted thermal\n\nchemical vapor deposition (CVD),\nwhich yields CNT lengths in excess of\n100\xe2\x80\x99s of microns. Vertical alignment,\ndeemed to be a critical feature in enabling the high optical absorption from\nCNT arrays, occurs primarily via the\ncrowding effect with thermal CVD synthesized CNTs, which is generally not effective in aligning CNTs with lengths <\n10 \xce\xbcm.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA nanovector multistage system has\nbeen created to overcome or bypass sequential barriers within the human\nbody, in order to deliver a therapeutic or\nimaging agent to a specific location.\nThis innovation consists of a composition that includes two or more stages of\nparticles, such that smaller, later-stage\nparticles are contained in the larger,\nearly-stage particles (see figure).\nSuch multistage compositions provide several advantages. An active agent,\nsuch as a therapeutic agent or imaging\nagent, is preferentially delivered and/or\nlocalized to a particular target site in the\nbody of a subject. The multistage composition overcomes multiple biological\nbarriers in the body. The multistage\ncomposition also allows for simultaneous delivery and localization at the same\nor different target sites of multiple active agents.\nFollowing administration, an active\nagent formulated conventionally, or in a\nnanovector, encounters a number of biological barriers that adversely impact\nthe agent\xe2\x80\x99s ability to reach an intended\ntarget at a desired location. Because\nthese barriers are sequential, the\nmethod for overcoming or bypassing\nthem has to be sequential as well. In this\ninnovation, each stage of the vehicle is\ndefined by a particle having a separate\nintended function, which may be different from an intended function of a particle of another stage. For example, a\nparticle of one stage is designed to target\na specific body site, which may be different from a site targeted by a particle of\nanother stage.\nA particle of each subsequent stage is\ncontained inside a particle of an immediately preceding stage. A particle of\nany particular stage may contain an active agent, such as the therapeutic\nagent or an imaging agent, intended\nfor use at this particular stage.

A potential advantage of using the top-down\nfabrication methods is that such methods\n\nprovide for a scaled-up production of particles that are uniform in dimensions.\nThis work was done by Mauro Ferrari and\nEnnio Tasciotti of the University of Texas\nHealth Science Center at Houston for Johnson\nSpace Center.

The\nwidespread detection of these organisms underscores the challenges in\neliminating them completely. Only\ncomprehensive and repetitive microbial diversity studies of geographically\ndistinct cleanroom facilities will bolster\nthe understanding of planetary protection relevant microbes. Extensive characterizations of the physiological traits\ndemonstrated by cleanroom microbes\nwill aid NASA in gauging the forward\ncontamination risk that hardy bacteria\n(such as Tersicoccus phoenicis) pose to\nspacecraft.\nRigorous standards are in place for\nthe cleaning and monitoring of spacecraft assembly environments to help\nminimize the inadvertent forward contamination by microorganisms during\nspace missions. Cleanroom environments are oligotrophic (low-nutrient\nlevel), desiccated (humidity controlled), certified to a defined low particle concentration, and maintained at\nconstant temperature. Yet despite these\nunfavorable conditions, a subset of tena-\n\n26\n\ncious microbes is known to exist in these\nassembly facilities.\nThis study reports on the isolation\nand identification of two gram-positive,\nnon-motile, non-spore-forming bacterial strains from the spacecraft assembly\nfacilities at Kennedy Space Center,\nFlorida, USA and Centre Spatial\nGuyanais, Kourou, French Guiana.\nDNA-DNA relatedness values between\nthe novel strains indicates that these\nnovel strains were indeed members of a\nsame species. Phylogenetic evidence derived from a 16S ribosomal DNA analysis indicated that both the novel strains\nare less closely related to all other\nArthrobacter species. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic results, it is concluded that these strains represent a\nnew species of the novel genus Tersicoccus, for which the name Tersicoccus\nphoenicis sp. nov. is proposed. The presence of Tersicoccus phoenicis exclusively in\nthe cleanroom environments from two\ndistinct geographical locations suggests\nselective adaptation and a significant\nrole for these microorganisms in these\nenvironments.\nMicrobes residing in the cleanrooms\nduring the spacecraft assembly process\n\ncould gain access to a spacecraft, and\npossibly survive en route to extraterrestrial systems. Tersicoccus and members of\nthe Arthrobacter genus are metabolically\nversatile, producing many different enzymes allowing them to grow on a wide\nrange of substrates, including agricultural pesticides, radioactive waste, and\nhigh concentration of toxic pollutant.\nPreviously undescribed Tersicoccus phoenicis, isolated from two distinct cleanroom\nfacilities, may exhibit even greater resilience than other microbial strains due\nto their selective adaptation to cleanroom environments. Thus, it is in the\nbest interest of NASA to characterize\nthis organism thoroughly, which will further assess in determining the potential\nfor forward contamination and development of more effective bioburden reduction, cleaning, and sterilization technologies.\nThis work was done by Parag A.

One common optical component that is used to minimize such an effect is a polarization\nscrambler or depolarizer. As part of the\nCLARREO mission, the SOLARIS instrument project at Goddard Space\nFlight Center has developed a new class\nof polarization scramblers using a dual\ndouble-wedge pseudo-depolarizer that\nproduces an anamorphic point spread\nfunction (PSF).\nThe SOLARIS instrument uses two\nWollaston type scramblers in series, each\nwith a distinct wedge angle, to image a\npseudo-depolarized scene that is free of\neigenstates. Since each wedge is distinct,\nthe scrambler is able to produce an\nanamorphic PSF that maintains high\nspatial resolution in one dimension by\n\nsacrificing the spatial resolution in the\nother dimension. This scrambler geometry is ideal for 1-D imagers, such as\npushbroom slit spectrometers, which require high spectral resolution, high spatial resolution, and low sensitivity to polarized light. Moreover, the geometry is\napplicable to a wide range of scientific\ninstruments that require both high SNR\n(signal-to-noise ratio) and low sensitivity\nto polarized scenes.\nClassic polarization scramblers are\nbuilt using birefringent glass that may\nbe either air-spaced or optically contacted together. Examples of birefringent materials include quartz, magnesium fluoride, and calcite. Two popular\ndesign forms of polarization scramblers\nare the Lyot and Wollaston types. The\nLyot type uses two plan parallel birefringent plates of different thicknesses to\nvary the polarization state as a function\n\nof wavelength. Integrating the scene\nacross a broad spectrum scrambles the\npolarized scene. This type reduces the\nspectral resolution of the scene. The\nWollaston type uses two wedged birefringent plates to scramble the polarization state spatially. This type reduces\nthe image quality of the scene. In addition to reducing the image quality of\nthe scene, a single Wollaston scrambler\nis known to have polarized eigenstates\nand is ineffective at scrambling certain\npolarized scenes.\nThe SOLARIS instrument is designed\nto measure the solar radiation reflected\nfrom the Earth. The design furthers the\nstate of the art in UV to near IR imaging\nspectroscopy.\nThis work was done by Peter Hill and\nPatrick Thompson of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.

GSC-16277-1\n\nCavitating Jet Method and System for Oxygenation of Liquids\nCavitation is considered to be more efficient in reclamation and re-use of water for space-based\nlife support systems than sonochemistry.\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nReclamation and re-use of water is critical for space-based life support systems. A\nnumber of functions must be performed\nby any such system including removal of\nvarious contaminants and oxygenation.\nFor long-duration space missions, this\nmust be done with a compact, reliable system that requires little or no use of expendables and minimal power. DynaJets\ncavitating jets can oxidize selected organic\ncompounds with much greater energy efficiency than ultrasonic devices typically\nused in sonochemistry. The focus of this\nwork was to develop cavitating jets to simultaneously accomplish the functions of\noxygenation and removal of contaminants of importance to space-structured\nwater reclamation systems.\nThe innovation is a method to increase the concentration of dissolved\noxygen or other gasses in a liquid. It uti-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nlizes a particular form of novel cavitating jet operating at low to moderate\npressures to achieve a high-efficiency\nmeans of transporting and mixing the\ngas into the liquid. When such a jet is\nutilized to simultaneously oxygenate the\nliquid and to oxidize organic compounds within the liquid, such as those\nin waste water, the rates of contaminant\nremoval are increased.\nThe invention is directed toward an\nincrease in the dissolved gas content of\na liquid, in general, and the dissolved\noxygen content of a liquid in particular. Liquid at moderate pressure is\nforced into a DynaSwirl swirl chamber\nin which a central vortex is formed that\nhas a core pressure lower than the\nvapor pressure of the liquid, thus inducing cavitation in the vortex into\nwhich the desired gas(es) are drawn or\n\ninjected. The cavitation is then ejected\nfrom the nozzle through the exit orifice into a volume of liquid where the\ncavities break up and collapse. The\nlarge cavity surface area and violent\nmixing due to cavity collapse are believed to facilitate gas transport and\ndissolution into the liquid. These cavitation events have also been found to\ndrive chemical reactions in a manner\nsimilar to that of ultrasonic sonochemistry, efficiently decomposing and destroying contaminating organic compounds. The reactions have been\nfound to proceed more rapidly in the\npresence of air injection or oxygenation by this means.\nThis work was done by Georges L.

Several techniques\nexist for generating slow beams of cold\natoms. However, one of the technically\nsimplest approaches is a two-dimensional (2D) MOT. Such an atom source\ntypically employs at least two orthogonal\ntrapping beams, plus an additional longitudinal \xe2\x80\x9cpush\xe2\x80\x9d beam to yield maximum atomic flux.\nA 2D atom source was created with angled trapping collimators that not only\ntraps atoms in two orthogonal directions, but also provides a longitudinal\npushing component that eliminates the\nneed for an additional push beam. This\ndevelopment reduces the overall package size, which in turn, makes the 2D\ntrap simpler, and requires less total optical power. The atom source is more compact than a previously published effort,\n\nand has greater than an order of magnitude improved loading performance.\nAn effective pushing field component\nwas realized by tilting the 2D MOT collimators towards a separate three-dimensional (3D) MOT in ultra-high vacuum. This technique significantly\nimproved 3D MOT loading rates to\ngreater than 8 \xc3\x97 109 atoms/s using only\n20 mW of total laser power for the\nsource. When operating below saturation, a maximum efficiency of 6.2 \xc3\x97 1011\natoms/s/W was achieved.\nOne of the most significant improvements of the present 2D MOT over conventional elliptical-beam 2D MOT designs is the angle of the collimators with\nrespect to the axis of the 2D MOT. Both\nthe horizontal and vertical collimators\nhave been optimized to include forward\ntilt. Associated retro-mirrors are\nmounted parallel to the axis of the 2D\nMOT, thus insuring that the reflected\nbeams are also projected forward at the\nsame angle as the incident beams, effectively resulting in a pushing component\nwith a fraction of the overall laser field\nin each orthogonal direction. The in-\n\ncreased push factor at larger collimator\nangles is offset by reduced lateral trapping efficiency. It is worth noting that\nthe intrinsic symmetry of a retro-reflected beam setup is very robust and\nsimple to use.\nThe\nforward-angled\ncollimator\nmethod allows for high 2D atomic flux\nwithout the need for an additional push\nlaser and associated optical and electronic hardware. This cold atom source\nmaintains very high efficiencies while\nutilizing a simpler, more compact, and\nmore robust package than previous\natom sources. The compact design and\nefficiency of the current apparatus is\nsuitable for cold atom applications in\nthe laboratory, and especially in mobile\ndevices, including cold atom instruments in space.\nThis work was done by James R.

In a system that utilizes digital\nsampling, the fidelity of synchronization\nis limited by the time between the symbol boundary and closest sample time location. To reduce this error, one typically uses a sample clock in excess of the\nsymbol rate in order to provide multiple\nsamples per symbol, thereby lowering\nthe error limit to a fraction of a symbol\ntime. For systems with a large modulation bandwidth, the required sample\nclock rate is prohibitive due to current\ntechnological barriers and processing\ncomplexity. With precise control of the\nphase of the sample clock, one can sample the received signal at times arbitrar-\n\n28\n\nily close to the symbol boundary, thus\nobviating the need, from a synchronization perspective, for multiple samples\nper symbol.\nSample-clock phase-control feedback\nwas developed for use in the demodulation of an optical communication signal,\nwhere multi-GHz modulation bandwidths would require prohibitively large\nsample clock frequencies for rates in excess of the symbol rate. A custom mixedsignal (RF/digital) offset phase-locked\nloop circuit was developed to control the\nphase of the 6.4-GHz clock that samples\nthe photon-counting detector output.\nThe offset phase-locked loop is driven by\na feedback mechanism that continuously corrects for variation in the symbol\ntime due to motion between the trans-\n\nmitter and receiver as well as oscillator\ninstability. This innovation will allow significant improvements in receiver\nthroughput; for example, the throughput of a pulse-position modulation\n(PPM) with 16 slots can increase from\n188 Mb/s to 1.5 Gb/s.\nThe novelty of this innovation is precise control of the sample-clock phase\nsupports synchronization to the symbol\ntiming of the received waveform without\nthe use of a sample clock in excess of the\nsymbol rate. This can reduce the required sample clock frequency for demodulation of a communication signal,\nand thereby reduce the processing complexity as well as permit demodulation\nof large bandwidth signals for which\nthere was a technological barrier to a\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nsample frequency in excess of the symbol rate.\nSample-clock phase-control feedback\nhas direct applications in optical and\nradio frequency communication systems\n\nfor satellite and deep space applications,\nas well as other applications in high-precision timing.\nThis work was done by Kevin J.

Successful operation\nrequired a sensing system mechanically\npackaged to withstand weather, sea\nspray, and an environment of continual\nmotion and mechanical shock. A lowcost, easily manufacturable, watertight,\nand mechanically robust sensing system\nwas developed for autonomous navigation and intelligent control.\nThe 360\xc2\xb0 camera head consists of a\nset of six color cameras arranged in a\ncircular pattern such that their overlapping fields of view give a full 360\xc2\xb0 view\nof the immediate surroundings. The\ncameras are enclosed in a watertight\ncontainer along with support electronics and a power distribution system.\nEach camera views the world through a\n\nwatertight porthole. To prevent overheating or condensation in extreme\nweather conditions, the watertight container is also equipped with an electrical\ncooling unit and a pair of internal fans\nfor circulation.\nMost JPL systems use cameras that\nare pointed at targets either through\nactuation or motion of the host vehicle. The 360\xc2\xb0 six-camera layout allows\nfull situational awareness in all directions with no actuation required. Also\nnovel is the watertight design, which\nencases all six cameras in a cylinder\nwith six symmetrically placed windows.\nEach window employs a porthole-style\ndesign, in which the circular glass\npane is sealed against an O-ring to\nprevent leaking. All cylinder access\npanels are similarly sealed with Orings, and the electrical cooling unit,\nwhich sits half inside and half outside\n\nthe camera head, is sealed with closed\ncell silicone foam.\nThis design proves the utility of 360\xc2\xb0\nvisual sensing to enhance situational\nawareness for Naval Unmanned Sea Surface Forces. The concept could be applied to future space missions to increase\nvisual situational awareness without increasing actuation requirements.\nThis work was done by Julie A. Townsend,\nEric A.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA new invention disclosure discusses a\nstructure and process for separating gas\nfrom liquids in microgravity. The Microgravity Passive Phase Separator consists\nof two concentric, pleated, woven stainless-steel screens (25-\xc2\xb5m nominal pore)\nwith an axial inlet, and an annular outlet between both screens (see figure).\nWater enters at one end of the center\nscreen at high velocity, eventually passing through the inner screen and out\nthrough the annular exit. As gas is introduced into the flow stream, the drag\nforce exerted on the bubble pushes it\ndownstream until flow stagnation or\nuntil it reaches an equilibrium point between the surface tension holding bubble to the screen and the drag force.\nGas bubbles of a given size will form a\n\xe2\x80\x9cfront\xe2\x80\x9d that is moved further down the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nMicrogravity Passive Phase Separator\n\n29\n\nlength of the inner screen with increasing\nvelocity. As more bubbles are added, the\nfront location will remain fixed, but additional bubbles will move to the end of the\nunit, eventually coming to rest in the large\ncavity between the unit housing and the\nouter screen (storage area). Owing to the\nsmall size of the pores and the hydrophilic\nnature of the screen material, gas does\nnot pass through the screen and is retained within the unit for emptying during ground processing. If debris is picked\nup on the screen, the area closest to the\ninlet will become clogged, so high-velocity\nflow will persist farther down the length of\nthe center screen, pushing the bubble\nfront further from the inlet of the inner\nscreen. It is desired to keep the velocity\n\n30\n\nhigh enough so that, for any bubble size,\nan area of clean screen exists between the\nbubbles and the debris.\nThe primary benefits of this innovation are the lack of any need for additional power, strip gas, or location for\nventing the separated gas. As the unit\ncontains no membrane, the transport\nfluid will not be lost due to evaporation\nin the process of gas separation. Separation is performed with relatively low pressure drop based on the large surface area\nof the separating screen. Additionally,\nthere are no moving parts, and there are\nno failure modes that involve fluid loss.

These models will allow circuit\ndesigners to create optimized, reliable,\nand robust circuits operating at cryogenic temperatures.\nCircuits that operate reliably at cryogenic temperatures are very difficult to\ndesign, because reliable semiconductor\ndevice and circuit models are not available for these temperatures. The unique\naspect of this problem is the unknown\nphysical characteristics of devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Standard\ncircuit models such as BSIM4 contain\nequations that can only predict device op-\n\neration near room temperature. Therefore, new equations and re-parameterization of existing equations need to be\ndone in order to functionalize the operation of state-of-the-art silicon CMOS devices at cryogenic temperatures.\nThese models will extend the roomtemperature BSIM4 type compact models to temperatures as low as 4 K.

Circuit simulations are run using\nthe new models at temperatures as low\nas 4 K. These models work in conjunction with other standard compact models without causing any convergence or\nother errors in the circuit simulator.\nThe models can be further modified\nto include effects of radiation such as\ntotal ionizing dose at cold temperatures.\nThese models will be able to predict\nlong-term reliability of CMOS-based\nelectronics operating under cryogenic\ntemperatures in radiation-rich environments.

Previous analysis methods\nfor creating beam envelopes (or cones\nof light) for use in this obstruction analy-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nsis were found to be cumbersome to calculate and take significant time and resources to complete. A new process was\ndeveloped that takes less time to complete beam envelope analysis, is more accurate and less dependent upon manual\nnode tracking to create the beam envelopes, and eases the burden on the\nmechanical CAD (computer-aided design) designers to form the beam solids.\n\nThis algorithm allows rapid generation of beam envelopes for optical system obstruction analysis. Ray trace information is taken from optical design\nsoftware and used to generate CAD objects that represent the boundary of the\nbeam envelopes for detailed analysis in\nmechanical CAD software.\nMatlab is used to call ray trace data\nfrom the optical model for all fields and\n\n31\n\nentrance pupil points of interest. These\nare chosen to be the edge of each space,\nso that these rays produce the bounding\nvolume for the beam. The x and y global\ncoordinate data is collected on the surface planes of interest, typically an image\nof the field and entrance pupil internal\nof the optical system. This x and y coordinate data is then evaluated using a\nconvex hull algorithm, which removes\nany internal points, which are unnecessary to produce the bounding volume of\ninterest. At this point, tolerances can be\napplied to expand the size of either the\n\nfield or aperture, depending on the allocations. Once this minimum set of coordinates on the pupil and field is obtained, a new set of rays is generated\nbetween the field plane and aperture\nplane (or vice-versa).\nThese rays are then evaluated at\nplanes between the aperture and field, at\na desired number of steps perceived necessary to build up the bounding volume\nor cone shape. At each plane, the ray coordinates are again evaluated using the\nconvex hull algorithm to reduce the data\nto a minimal set. When all of the coordi-\n\nnates of interest are obtained for every\nplane of the propagation, the data is formatted into an xyz file suitable for FRED\noptical analysis software to import and\ncreate a STEP file of the data.

GSC-16176-1\n\nHigh-Performance, Multi-Node File Copies and Checksums\nfor Clustered File Systems\nAmes Research Center, Moffett Field, California\nModern parallel file systems achieve\nhigh performance using a variety of\ntechniques, such as striping files across\nmultiple disks to increase aggregate I/O\nbandwidth and spreading disks across\nmultiple servers to increase aggregate\ninterconnect bandwidth. To achieve\npeak performance from such systems, it\nis typically necessary to utilize multiple\nconcurrent readers/writers from multiple systems to overcome various singlesystem limitations, such as number of\nprocessors and network bandwidth. The\nstandard cp and md5sum tools of GNU\ncoreutils found on every modern\nUnix/Linux system, however, utilize a\nsingle execution thread on a single CPU\ncore of a single system, and hence cannot take full advantage of the increased\n\nperformance of clustered file systems.\nMcp and msum are drop-in replacements for the standard cp and md5sum\nprograms that utilize multiple types of\nparallelism and other optimizations to\nachieve maximum copy and checksum\nperformance on clustered file systems.\nMulti-threading is used to ensure that\nnodes are kept as busy as possible.\nRead/write parallelism allows individual\noperations of a single copy to be overlapped using asynchronous I/O. Multinode cooperation allows different nodes\nto take part in the same copy/checksum.\nSplit-file processing allows multiple\nthreads to operate concurrently on the\nsame file. Finally, hash trees allow inherently serial checksums to be performed\nin parallel.\n\nMcp and msum provide significant performance improvements over standard cp\nand md5sum using multiple types of parallelism and other optimizations. The\ntotal speed-ups from all improvements are\nsignificant. Mcp improves cp performance over 27\xc3\x97, msum improves md5sum\nperformance almost 19\xc3\x97, and the combination of mcp and msum improves verified copies via cp and md5sum by almost\n22\xc3\x97. These improvements come in the\nform of drop-in replacements for cp and\nmd5sum, so are easily used and are available for download as open source software at http://mutil.sourceforge.net.\nThis work was done by Paul Z.

ARC-16494-1\n\nStiffness and Damping Coefficient Estimation of Compliant\nSurface Gas Bearings for Oil-Free Turbomachinery\nInitial applications include design of turbochargers, blowers, compressors, pumps,\nand turbine engines.\nJohn H. Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nFoil gas bearings are a key technology\nin many commercial and emerging oilfree turbomachinery systems. These\nbearings are nonlinear and have been\ndifficult to analytically model in terms of\nperformance characteristics such as load\ncapacity, power loss, stiffness, and damping. Previous investigations led to an empirically derived method to estimate\nload capacity. This method has been a\n\n32\n\nvaluable tool in system development.\nThe current work extends this tool concept to include rules for stiffness and\ndamping coefficient estimation. It is expected that these rules will further accelerate the development and deployment\nof advanced oil-free machines operating\non foil gas bearings.\nFoil gas bearings are self-acting hydrodynamic bearings comprised of a series\n\nof sheet-metal foil layers from which they\nderive their name. They are compliant\nbearings that offer high-speed rotor support while accommodating shaft misalignment and distortion often encountered in turbomachinery. Lightly loaded,\nlow-temperature foil gas bearings are\ncommodities that predominate in the\nrotor support for aircraft air cycle machines (ACMs). More highly loaded foil\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nbearings operating at high temperatures\nare an emerging technology making\ncommercial inroads into several markets\nincluding aircraft auxiliary power units\n(APUs), microturbines, gas compressors\nand blowers, and turbochargers.\nThe general trend for foil bearings\nsince their initial development over five\ndecades ago is application to larger and\nmore complex rotor systems. As this proliferation occurs, more practitioners will\nbecome actively involved with new machine development using foil bearings.\nThus, there is a great need for application guidelines to establish the feasibility\nof proposed rotor systems and to identify existing machines that are good candidates for foil bearing use. Specifically,\na method is needed to estimate foil bearing stiffness and damping behavior in\norder to foster advanced oil-free rotating\nmachine development.\n\nMethods to estimate critical stiffness\nand damping parameters, however, do\nnot currently exist. The purpose of the\nmethods put forth in this work is to establish simple tools capable of estimating foil\nbearing stiffness and damping coefficients suitable for oil-free rotor support\ndesign work. This has been accomplished\nby first coalescing all available empirical\ndata on foil bearing performance that\nhas been generated in the author\xe2\x80\x99s own\nlaboratories, and by researchers working\nin university, government, and industrial\nlaboratories. This information is examined and combined, then used to develop ROT for foil bearing stiffness and\ndamping. These ROTs can then be combined with existing rules for load capacity\nto obtain credible feasibility assessments\nfor proposed oil-free rotor systems.\nThe effort described has resulted in\nalgebraic models for foil gas bearings\n\nthat yield stiffness, damping, and load\ncapacity values as a function of bearing\nsize, design, and operating speed. With\nthese models, one can easily determine\nthe feasibility of building a foil bearing\nsupported machine without incurring\nthe expense of early experimental work.\nThe models presented represent the\nonly known and verified methods to predict conveniently foil bearing performance properties.\nThis work was done by Christopher DellaCorte of Glenn Research Center.

The analysis begins\nwith the observation that the Fourier\ntransform of an optical aperture function (pupil) can be implemented with\nminimal aliasing for Q values down to Q\n= 1. The sampling ratio, Q, is defined as\nthe ratio of the sampling frequency to\nthe band-limited cut-off frequency. The\n\nanalytical results are given using a 1-d\naperture function, and with the electric\nfield defined by the band-limited sinc(x)\nfunction. Perfect reconstruction of the\nFourier transform (electric field) is derived using the Whittaker-Shannon sampling theorem for 1<Q<2.\nThe Fourier transform is constructed\nby periodic extension, i.e., by spacing\ncopies of the transform in a definite way,\nrecognizing that no aliasing occurs for\nvalues of the sampling ratio such that\n\n1<Q<2, which can be used to advantage\nin the application of phase retrieval estimation. A method was developed for\npropagating the electromagnetic field\nwith no aliasing, which has been extended to 2-d optical apertures.\nThis work was done by Bruce Dean, Jeffrey\nSmith, and David Aronstein of Goddard\nSpace Flight Center.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nHealth management (HM) in any\nengineering systems requires adequate\nunderstanding about the system\xe2\x80\x99s functioning; a sufficient amount of monitored data; the capability to extract, analyze, and collate information; and the\ncapability to combine understanding\nand information for HM-related estimation and decision-making. Rotorcraft systems are, in general, highly\ncomplex. Obtaining adequate understanding about functioning of such systems is quite difficult, because of the\nproprietary (restricted access) nature\nof their designs and dynamic models.\nDevelopment of an EIM (exact inverse\nmap) solution for rotorcraft requires a\nprocess that can overcome the abovementioned difficulties and maximally\nutilize monitored information for HM\nfacilitation via employing advanced analytic techniques.\n\nThe goal was to develop a versatile\nHM solution for rotorcraft for facilitation of the Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) capabilities. The\neffort was geared towards developing analytic and reasoning techniques, and\nproving the ability to embed the required capabilities on a rotorcraft platform, paving the way for implementing\nthe solution on an aircraft-level system\nfor consolidation and reporting.\nThe solution for rotorcraft can he\nused offboard or embedded directly\nonto a rotorcraft system. The envisioned\nsolution utilizes available monitored and\narchived data for real-time fault detection and identification, failure precursor\nidentification, and offline fault detection and diagnostics, health condition\nforecasting, optimal guided troubleshooting, and maintenance decision\nsupport. A variant of the onboard ver-\n\nsion is a self-contained hardware and\nsoftware (HW+SW) package that can be\nembedded on rotorcraft systems.\nThe HM solution comprises components that gather/ingest data and information, perform information/feature extraction, analyze information in conjunction\nwith the dependency/diagnostic model of\nthe target system, facilitate optimal guided\ntroubleshooting, and offer decision support for optimal maintenance.\nThis work was done by Deepak Haste, Mohammad Azam, Sudipto Ghoshal, and James\nMonte of Qualtech Systems for Glenn Research\nCenter.

Refer to LEW-18672-1.\n\nRecursive Branching Simulated Annealing Algorithm\nThe algorithm can be applied to a wide variety of optimization problems.\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nThis innovation is a variation of a\nsimulated-annealing optimization algorithm that uses a recursive-branching\nstructure to parallelize the search of a\nparameter space for the globally optimal solution to an objective. The algorithm has been demonstrated to be\nmore effective at searching a parameter\nspace than traditional simulated-annealing methods for a particular problem of interest, and it can readily be applied to a wide variety of optimization\nproblems, including those with a parameter space having both discretevalue parameters (combinatorial) and\ncontinuous-variable parameters. It can\n\n34\n\ntake the place of a conventional simulated-annealing, Monte-Carlo, or random-walk algorithm.\nIn a conventional simulated-annealing (SA) algorithm, a starting configuration is randomly selected within the parameter space. The algorithm randomly\nselects another configuration from the\nparameter space and evaluates the objective function for that configuration. If\nthe objective function value is better\nthan the previous value, the new configuration is adopted as the new point of\ninterest in the parameter space. If the\nobjective function value is worse than\nthe previous value, the new configura-\n\ntion may be adopted, with a probability\ndetermined by a temperature parameter, used in analogy to annealing in metals. As the optimization continues, the\nregion of the parameter space from\nwhich new configurations can be selected shrinks, and in conjunction with\nlowering the annealing temperature\n(and thus lowering the probability for\nadopting configurations in parameter\nspace with worse objective functions),\nthe algorithm can converge on the globally optimal configuration.\nThe Recursive Branching Simulated\nAnnealing (RBSA) algorithm shares some\nfeatures with the SA algorithm, notably in-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\ncluding the basic principles that a starting\nconfiguration is randomly selected from\nwithin the parameter space, the algorithm\ntests other configurations with the goal of\nfinding the globally optimal solution, and\nthe region from which new configurations can be selected shrinks as the search\ncontinues. The key difference between\nthese algorithms is that in the SA algorithm, a single path, or trajectory, is taken\nin parameter space, from the starting\npoint to the globally optimal solution,\nwhile in the RBSA algorithm, many trajectories are taken; by exploring multiple regions of the parameter space simultane-\n\nously, the algorithm has been shown to\nconverge on the globally optimal solution\nabout an order of magnitude faster than\nwhen using conventional algorithms.\nNovel features of the RBSA algorithm\ninclude:\n1. More efficient searching of the parameter space due to the branching\nstructure, in which multiple random\nconfigurations are generated and\nmultiple promising regions of the parameter space are explored;\n2. The implementation of a trust region\nfor each parameter in the parameter\nspace, which provides a natural way of\n\nenforcing upper- and lower-bound\nconstraints on the parameters; and\n3. The optional use of a constrained gradient-search optimization, performed\non the continuous variables around\neach branch\xe2\x80\x99s configuration in parameter space to improve search efficiency\nby allowing for fast fine-tuning of the\ncontinuous variables within the trust\nregion at that configuration point.\nThis work was done by Matthew Bolcar, J.\nScott Smith, and David Aronstein of Goddard\nSpace Flight Center.

GSC-15908-1\n\nMethod for Pre-Conditioning a Measured Surface Height Map\nfor Model Validation\nThis method can be implemented in most optical modeling and simulation software.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThis software allows one to up-sample\nor down-sample a measured surface\nmap for model validation, not only without introducing any re-sampling errors,\nbut also eliminating the existing measurement noise and measurement errors.\nBecause the re-sampling of a surface\nmap is accomplished based on the analytical expressions of Zernike-polynomials and a power spectral density model,\nsuch re-sampling does not introduce any\naliasing and interpolation errors as is\ndone by the conventional interpolation\nand FFT-based (fast-Fourier-transformbased) spatial-filtering method. Also,\nthis new method automatically eliminates the measurement noise and other\nmeasurement errors such as artificial\ndiscontinuity.\nThe developmental cycle of an optical\nsystem, such as a space telescope, includes, but is not limited to, the following two steps: (1) deriving requirements\nor specs on the optical quality of individual optics before they are fabricated\nthrough optical modeling and simulations, and (2) validating the optical\nmodel using the measured surface\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2012\n\nheight maps after all optics are fabricated. There are a number of computational issues related to model validation,\none of which is the \xe2\x80\x9cpre-conditioning\xe2\x80\x9d\nor pre-processing of the measured surface maps before using them in a model\nvalidation software tool.\nThis software addresses the following\nissues: (1) up- or down-sampling a measured surface map to match it with the\ngridded data format of a model validation tool, and (2) eliminating the surface measurement noise or measurement errors such that the resulted\nsurface height map is continuous or\nsmoothly-varying. So far, the preferred\nmethod used for re-sampling a surface\nmap is two-dimensional interpolation.\nThe main problem of this method is that\nthe same pixel can take different values\nwhen the method of interpolation is\nchanged among the different methods\nsuch as the \xe2\x80\x9cnearest,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clinear,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccubic,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand \xe2\x80\x9cspline\xe2\x80\x9d fitting in Matlab. The conventional, FFT-based spatial filtering\nmethod used to eliminate the surface\nmeasurement noise or measurement errors can also suffer from aliasing effects.\n\nDuring re-sampling of a surface\nmap, this software preserves the low\nspatial-frequency characteristic of a\ngiven surface map through the use of\nZernike-polynomial fit coefficients,\nand maintains mid- and high-spatialfrequency characteristics of the given\nsurface map by the use of a PSD model\nderived from the two-dimensional PSD\ndata of the mid- and high-spatial-frequency components of the original surface map. Because this new method\ncreates the new surface map in the desired sampling format from analytical\nexpressions only, it does not encounter\nany aliasing effects and does not cause\nany discontinuity in the resultant surface map.\nThis work was done by Erkin Sidick of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The shape of this\nultra-black mask can be adjusted to provide a smooth transition to the clear\naperture of the secondary mirror to minimize diffracted light.\nCarbon nanotubes grown on silicon\nare a viable telescope mirror substrate,\nand can absorb significantly more light\nthan other black treatments. The hemispherical reflectance of multi-walled carbon nanotubes grown at GSFC is approximately 3 to 10 times better than a\nstandard aerospace paint used for stray\nlight control. At the LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) wavelength\nof 1 micron, the advantage over paint is\na factor of 10.\nPrimarily, in the center of the secondary mirror (in the region of central obscu-\n\nration, where no received light is lost) a\nblack mask is applied to absorb transmitted light that could be reflected back into\nthe receiver. In the LISA telescope, this is\nin the center couple of millimeters. The\nshape of this absorber is critical to suppress diffraction at the edge. By using the\ncorrect shape, the stray light can be reduced by approximately 10 to the 9 orders\nof magnitude versus no center mask. The\neffect of the nanotubes has been simulated in a stray-light model. The effect of\nthe apodizing mask has been simulated in\na near-field diffraction model. Specifications are geometry-dependent, but the\nbaseline design for the LISA telescope has\nbeen modeled as well.
