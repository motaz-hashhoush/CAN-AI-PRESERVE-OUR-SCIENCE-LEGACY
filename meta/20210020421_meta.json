Until the Voyager 1 1980, even fundamentals such as its true diameter, surface pressure, and major atmospheric gas were uncertain [1]. Most of the information we now know about Titan has been wrestled at great expense of time and effort by three spacecraft visitors: Voyager 1, Cassini and Huygens. So why then continue to bother with Earth-based telescopic observations? In this review talk I will describe how significant clues about Titan\u2019s atmospheric composition began to emerge from ground-based observations in the 1940s through 1970s, in the run-up to the revolutionary Voyager 1 flyby. These included the discovery of methane [2], and other significant hydrocarbons including ethane and acetylene in Titan\u2019s stratosphere [3, 4]. Further ground and space-based telescopic work in the 1980s and 1990s revealed the presence of the fourth most abundance gas, carbon monoxide [5], spotted for the first time the bright continent on Titan\u2019s leading hemisphere now known as Xanadu [6], and the comings and\ngoings of bright tropospheric clouds [7]. The Cassini-Huygens mission of 2004-2017 [8, 9] greatly expanded our knowledge of Titan, including the first in situ measurements of the atmosphere and detailed imaging of the surface. However in the two-decades long gap before the next mission, Dragonfly, reaches Titan we are finding new ways to further our knowledge of Titan using the current generation of telescopes and instruments. With high-resolution spectroscopy at infrared and sub-millimeter wavelengths we are finding new chemical constituents in the atmosphere, and even measuring wind fields at middle altitudes. I will conclude by discussing how the next generation of Earth and space-based telescopes and instruments promises yet more breakthroughs via astronomy, including with large aperture 30 and 40 meter class telescopes that will become available in the late 2020s, and spectroscopy with airborne", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210020421, "endDate": "2021-08-12T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "location": "Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "ca5e5d4872744248a3d4ddbd8607a31a", "id": "3c5925ecebf44a9a8b881eee234b494a"}], "name": "Titan Through Time 5", "location": "Boulder, CO", "id": "ca5e5d4872744248a3d4ddbd8607a31a", "url": "https://titanthroughtime.org/home.html", "startDate": "2021-08-10T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "21-88.pdf", "type": "ABSTRACT", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210020421/downloads/21-88.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210020421/downloads/21-88.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210020421/downloads/21-88.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
