Complete geologic maps and packages of ancillary materials for V-23 and V-24 have been submitted to USGS and are currently under review. In addition to these products, we have published or submitted various manuscript and/abstracts detailing the results of our research that has grown out of the proposed work. We presented our maps in various stages of construction at NASA Planetary Geology and Geophysics Mappers' meeting each year. We have also presented talks or posters summarizing our work at various conferences including: he Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, and the National Geological Society of America meeting. The work resulted in exciting developments of Venus lowland resurfacing. The products and publications resulting from this work are listed below.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050210098, "id": "5308260455a3456791080e37d8fd537b", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
