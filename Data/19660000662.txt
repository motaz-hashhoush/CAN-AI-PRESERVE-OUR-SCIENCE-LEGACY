Copies are available to the public at 15 cents each\nfrom the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information, Springfield, Virginia 22151.\n\nPackaging of Electronic Modules\nA study has been made of design approaches that\ncan be taken toward optimizing the packaging of\nelectronic modules (such as cordwood modules and\nprinted circuit cards) with respect to size, shape, component orientation, interconnections, and structural\nsupport. The study gives consideration to the geometry of two- and three-dimensional modular arrays\nfrom the standpoint of implementing their subassembly and packaging by simple automatic machines.\nNotes:\n1. The study does not present a solution to specific\npackaging problems, but rather delineates the\nfactors that should be considered in efforts to\nachieve optimum packaging designs.\n\nInquiries concerning this study may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, California 91103\nReference: B66-10664\nPatent status:\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\nSource: Leonard Katzin\n(JPL-801)\n\nCategory 01\nis\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
