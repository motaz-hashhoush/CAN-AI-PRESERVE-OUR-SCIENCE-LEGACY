(Fig. 1) SLS is NASA\u2019s evolvable super-heavy-lift launch vehicle to support deep space exploration. It is based on evolutionary improvement to existing proven propulsion systems. Its twin solid rocket boosters employ a five-segment motor based on the four-segment space shuttle motor. Its four RS-25 main engines will operate at thrust levels higher than those in the space shuttle program. The core stage is anew design that will support propellant tanks for the engines and serve as the attach point for the boosters. Modern streamlined manufacturing processes and materials have been incorporated into the initial configuration with planned onramps for improved performance and/or affordability in subsequent versions. The primary role of SLS is to anchor the transportation for NASA\u2019s Artemis Program to return humans to the Moon and build on the exploration that began during the Apollo Program. This paper will discuss progress to date for the SLS Program and look ahead to important milestones in 2020 and beyond.
