The WTFF system is a multiplexing device developed to process and downlink the high rate data generated by a wide variety of users. The WTFF is designed to frame and format high data rate user channels into transport frames and multiplex according to a predefined schedule into two bit streams that are compatible with TDRS Ku I and Q band service. The combined data rate will be 300 Mbps. The WTFF will service up to eight input channels generating data in the range of 10 to 150 Mbps. In addition to these input channels, audio data will be accepted by the WTFF system and inserted in the downlink. A second function of the WTFF is to provide telecommunication coding as assigned to each virtual channel to ensure a given quality of service.", "title": "TDRS Ku band gateway", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T15:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880046424, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Collins, Cynthia"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "55b5044dbbd54bf2a5329887073e61c3"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880046424, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lecha, Javier"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "94cede5cc2c14b4cb3e6e4291d2f934b"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19880046424, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Principe, Caleb M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "9d0997a9786d4205838eb0f3a129dff3"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19880046424, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ross, Douglas"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Grenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "46cd231480794d5697ce418d88bc7a12"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19880046424, "endDate": "1987-10-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Foundation for Telemetering"}}, "meetingId": "01e7594bd3484f96b784c531eb582714", "id": "9f97da02fbd74b168c7aec36f6d3825d"}], "name": "ITC/USA/''87", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "01e7594bd3484f96b784c531eb582714", "startDate": "1987-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19880046424, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880046424, "id": "b59122300cca4f7484c5a1db93cb8f14", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
