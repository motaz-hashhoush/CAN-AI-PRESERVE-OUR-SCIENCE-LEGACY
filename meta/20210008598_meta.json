This paper describes the testing and results of two Lockheed Martin Micro1-2 coolers optimized for these conditions. The thermal performance of the microcoolers was measured in vacuum for heat reject temperatures between 220 and 230 K. The coolers were operated with input powers ranging from 5 W to 40 W and drive frequency between 125 Hz and 145 Hz. The optimal drive frequency was strongly dependent on heat reject temperature. In addition, the exported forces and torques of the coolers were measured at 300 K heat rejection for input powers ranging from 5 W to 60 W and drive frequency between 120 Hz and 160 Hz. The exported forces were dependent on both piston amplitude and drive frequency. Moreover, the following were measured on one of the coolers: DC and AC magnetic fields at various locations, the off-state conductance of the pulse tube, and the effect of inclination angle of the pulse tube relative to gravity on the performance of the cooler. Finally, one of the coolers was subjected to random vibration testing.", "title": "Characterization Testing of Lockheed Martin Micro1-2 Cryocoolers Optimized for 220 K Environment", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008598, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rodriguez, J.I."}}, "id": "334c58bf58f344aa9d33beeffb942cee"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008598, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Johnson, D.L."}}, "id": "5db541dc8403404dbea99f07d5b246eb"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008598, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mok, M.A."}}, "id": "2210bd0c064e43e89aee4753d088d3c3"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008598, "meta": {"author": {"name": "McKinley, I.M."}}, "id": "83026c125eb54cfab3ccdcb4d4f359b7"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:22:42.2983730+00:00", "id": 20210008598, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/48437", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210008598, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2018", "id": "cdcc1194325849a69107b39304f22097", "publicationDate": "2018-06-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
