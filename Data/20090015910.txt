b'Real-Time Digital Radiography Upgrade\n\n16th NNWG Workshop\nLaRC, Hampton VA\nNovember, 2008\n\nBradford H. Parker\nGoddard Space Flight Center\n\n1\n\nobjective\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe objective of the task is to upgrade an existing real-time digital radiography\nsystem by replacing an aged image intensifier tube with an amorphous silicon\ndigital x-ray imager.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe real-time digital radiography system at GSFC is currently fitted with image\nintensifier tube with a 4 or 2 inch diameter active area with higher resolution at\nthe smaller area. The image intensifier is exhibiting deterioration in sensitivity\nassociated with extended use and is in need of replacement.\nPaxScan 2520V Amorphous\nSilicon Digital X-ray Imager\n\xe2\x80\xa2 127um pixel size\n\xe2\x80\xa2 8\xe2\x80\x9dx10\xe2\x80\x9d active area\n\xe2\x80\xa2 7.5fps (1x1) and 30 fps (2x2)\nQuickTime\xe2\x84\xa2 and a\nTIFF (Uncompressed) decompressor\nare needed to see this picture.\n\n2\n\nStatus: complete\nA premium grade PaxScan 2520V amorphous silicon flat panel detector\nrated for 225 kV was procured, installed and is operational.\n\n3\n\nperformance\n\n4\n\nperformance\n\n5\n\n'
