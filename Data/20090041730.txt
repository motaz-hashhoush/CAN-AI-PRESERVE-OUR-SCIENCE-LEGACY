b'FOIL FACE SEAL TESTING\nJohn Munson\nRolls-Royce\nIndianapolis, Indiana\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n131\n\nIn the seal literature you can find many attempts by various researchers to adapt film\nriding seals to the gas turbine engine. None have been successful, potential\ndistortion of the sealing faces is the primary reason. There is a film riding device\nthat does accommodate distortion and is in service in aircraft applications, namely\nthe foil bearing. More specifically a foil thrust bearing. These are not intended to be\nseals, and they do not accommodate large axial movement between shaft & static\nstructure.\nBy combining the 2 a unique type of face seal has been created. It functions like a\nnormal face seal. The foil thrust bearing replaces the normal primary sealing\nsurface. The compliance of the foil bearing allows the foils to track distortion of the\nmating seal ring.\nThe foil seal has several perceived advantages over existing hydrodynamic designs,\nenumerated in the chart. Materials and design methodology needed for this\napplication already exist. Also the load capacity requirements for the foil bearing are\nlow since it only needs to support itself and overcome friction forces at the antirotation keys.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n132\n\nLift-off testing was done to establish where would we expect an engine seal to go\nfrom contacting to non-contacting. Extrapolation of the test results indicates that\nthis should occur between 1500 and 2000 RPM. While this is well below the\nengine operating range, it implies that some form of protective coating is required\nfor the foils.\nThe seal was tested with up to 3\xc2\xb0 of coning built into the mating ring. The test\nresults seem to suggest that the only limit to how much coning the seal can\naccommodate is a function of the clearance built into the bump foil. No difference\nin operation was noted between coned and non-coned mating ring tests.\nWe also presented results wherein the static structure was made out-of-flat\ncircumferentially. The seal easily accommodated 0.009\xe2\x80\x9d of distortion. These\nresults were supplemented with additional testing wherein the rotating sealing\nsurface was manufactured circumferentially out-of-flat (OOF). The goal 0.008\xe2\x80\x9d\nOOF requirement was scaled for these tests to preserve the aspect ratio of the\n\xe2\x80\x9cwave.\xe2\x80\x9d A maximum of 0.003\xe2\x80\x9d OOF was used for the 3 and 5 wavelength tests.\nWith 5 waves the OOF is equivalent to 0.009\xe2\x80\x9d OOF with a 16\xe2\x80\x9d diameter seal. The\nseal also accommodated this distortion, although with 5 waves, 0.003\xe2\x80\x9d OOF load\ncapacity was reduced by approximately 30%.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n133\n\nThe proof-of-concept seal was also used to characterize expected seal leakage so\nthat this seal could be compared with other types of seals, e.g. labyrinth or brush,\nused in secondary flow path applications. Tests were run with a variety of axial\nloads and differential pressures applied. The tests were conducted at several\ndifferent speeds, as well. As the figure indicates, no clear effect of speed on\nleakage was observed. A general leakage curve was fitted to the test data. This\ncurve was used to compare foil seal leakage to other seals. This result is shown in\nthe figure at top right. At very low differential pressures the seal s all give similar\nperformance. At higher differential pressures the foil seal is clearly superior.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n134\n\nIn terms of cost versus benefit it has always been clear that there are only certain\nengine sealing locations where the foil type face seal is best suited. These are \xe2\x80\x9chighvalue\xe2\x80\x9d sealing locations within engines such as rotor thrust balance and/or turbine\nrim seals. As encouraging as the proof-of-concept testing was, it is a long way from\nthe small 4.5\xe2\x80\x9d OD demo seal to the up to 36\xe2\x80\x9d diameter seals that will be required for\nthe applications under consideration.\nAs the slide shows, temperatures and speeds tend to be high but differential\npressures modest relative to all other seal industry applications. Some of the\napplications under consideration will also need to accommodate large axial\nexcursions. Radial excursions are also equally large. These have not been shown\nbecause they can be easily accommodated by ensuring the mating ring face is\nalways large enough so that the primary sealing face stays completely in contact\nwith the mating ring. For a conventional spiral groove type film riding face seal\nthese excursions would be more concerning as they would have led to\nunsymmetrical lift forces.\nPresent plans are to test an approximately half size seal. This size was selected\nbecause:\nIt provides a means to check for effect of size on seal performance\nTo allow supplier supply chain development for large parts\nTest rig size limitations versus the type of testing desired\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n135\n\nThe ability to simulate the expected axial excursions while the seal was rotating was\nseen as a prime requirement for selection of a test rig. This and the envisioned size\nof the test parts determined the selection of the test rig. Stein Seal\xe2\x80\x99s dual shaft rig is\nbeing configured to run the planned test program. Two test seals are used in a face\nto face configuration to eliminate the large thrust imbalance load that a single seal\nwould have imposed on the shaft.\nThe completed test seals are shown in the small upper right hand figure. The seals\nare right and left handed but otherwise identical in design.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n136\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n137\n\n'
