The initial 60 days was dedicated to Spitzer's \"In-Orbit Checkout (IOC)\" efforts. During this time high levels of Helium venting were used to cool down the telescope. Attitude control was done using reaction wheels, which in turn were de-saturated using cold gas Nitrogen thrusting. Dense tracking data (nearly continuous) by the Deep Space network (DSN) were used to perform orbit determination and to assess any possible venting imbalance. Only Doppler data were available for navigation. This paper deals with navigation efforts during the IOC phase. It includes Dust Cover Ejection (DCE) monitoring, orbit determination strategy validation and results and assessment of non-gravitational accelerations acting on Spitzer including that due to possible imbalance in Helium venting.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20070023574, "endDate": "2004-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialst Conference and Exhibit", "location": "Providence, RI", "id": "2decf49c32f4458d8bb6957aee4fea9f", "startDate": "2004-08-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070023574, "id": "5079af8481ca4ea79060688308bc8f5a", "publicationDate": "2004-08-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
