The purpose of the workshop was to review and evaluate the current state of the art of agricultural aviation, to identify and rank potentially productive short and long range research and development areas, and to strengthen communications between research scientists and engineers involved in agricultural research. Approximately 71 individuals actively engaged in agricultural aviation research were invited to participate in the workshop. These were persons familiar with problems related to agricultural aviation and processing expertise which are of value for identifying and proposing beneficial research.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780005056, "id": "5c63e8e9ecd4419b9c416c187938a5c7", "publicationDate": "1977-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19780005056.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19780005056/downloads/19780005056.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19780005056/downloads/19780005056.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19780005056/downloads/19780005056.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
