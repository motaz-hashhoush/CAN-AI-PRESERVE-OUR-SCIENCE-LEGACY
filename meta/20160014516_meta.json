The rollout environment is rich with forced harmonics and higher order effects can be used for extracting structural dynamics information. To enable this utilization, processing tools are needed to move from measured and analytical data to dynamic metrics such as transfer functions, mode shapes, modal frequencies, and damping. This paper covers the range of systems and tests that are available to estimate rollout forcing functions for the Space Launch System (SLS). The specific information covered in this paper includes: the different definitions of rollout forcing functions; the operational and developmental data sets that are available; the suite of analytical processes that are currently in-place or in-development; and the plans and future work underway to solve two immediate problems related to rollout forcing functions. Problem 1 involves estimating enforced accelerations to drive finite element models for developing design requirements for the SLS class of launch vehicles. Problem 2 involves processing rollout measured data in near real time to understand structural dynamics properties of a specific vehicle and the class to which it belongs.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160014516, "endDate": "2017-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "7a66994f51304baf9c1ebc0beb4ca9f2", "id": "478940d92c054c11936fc2956e545c37"}], "name": "SciTech Forum", "location": "Grapevine, TX", "id": "7a66994f51304baf9c1ebc0beb4ca9f2", "startDate": "2017-01-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160014516, "id": "b61f7a41762548aa91c601504c3761bf", "publicationDate": "2016-11-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160014516.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160014516/downloads/20160014516.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160014516/downloads/20160014516.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160014516/downloads/20160014516.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
