Winglets are lifting surfaces designed to operate in the vortex or air whirlpool that occurs at an airplanes wingtip. This complex flow of air creates air drag; the winglets job is to reduce the strength of the vortex and thereby substantially reduce drag, additionally the winglet generates its own lift producing forward thrust in the manner of a sailboat's sail. Combination of reduced drag and additional thrust adds up to improvement in fuel efficiency.", "title": "Business Jets", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020086730, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020086730, "id": "c0ef6d5464d14b4dbee7e177ccf3e07d", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1988", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020086730.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020086730/downloads/20020086730.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020086730/downloads/20020086730.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020086730/downloads/20020086730.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
