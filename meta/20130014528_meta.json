Whereas this process often involves much research through quality documents followed by laborious coding, the DQSS is a Web Service that provides data users with data pre-filtered to their particular criteria, while at the same time guiding the user with filtering recommendations of the cognizant data experts. The DQSS design is based on a formal semantic Web ontology that describes data fields and the quality fields for applying quality control within a data product. The accompanying code base handles several remote sensing datasets and quality control schemes for data products stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), a common format for NASA remote sensing data. Together, the ontology and code support a variety of quality control schemes through the implementation of the Boolean expression with simple, reusable conditional expressions as operands. Additional datasets are added to the DQSS simply by registering instances in the ontology if they follow a quality scheme that is already modeled in the ontology. New quality schemes are added by extending the ontology and adding code for each new scheme.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130014528, "id": "1104c27520384ccfbf70a5a7de72e8a0", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, December 2013", "publicationDate": "2013-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20130014512, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, December 2013", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130014528.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130014528/downloads/20130014528.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130014528/downloads/20130014528.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130014528/downloads/20130014528.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
