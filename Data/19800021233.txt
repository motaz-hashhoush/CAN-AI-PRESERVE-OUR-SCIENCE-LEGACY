Lubricant was supplied\nthrough holes in the cone at both the large and small\nends of the rollers. Test conditions included shaft\nspeeds from 6000 to 20 000 rpm, radial loads from\n13 300 to 26 700 N (3000 to 6000 Ib), thrust loads\nfrom 26 700 to 53 400 N (6000 to 12 000 lb), lubricant flow rates from 0.0038 to 0.0151 m3/min (1.0 to\n4.0 gal/min), and lubricant inlet temperatures of 350\nand 364 K (170" and 195"F). The test bearing design\nwas computer optimized for high-speed operation.\nThe lubricant was MIL-L-23699.\nThe high-speed-design tapered-roller bearing\noperated successfully at shaft speeds up to 20 000\nrpm under heavy thrust and radial loads. Stable\ntemperatures were reached, and no surface distress\nwas observed within the range of conditions tested.\nBearing temperatures and heat generation with the\nhigh-speed-design bearing were significantly less than\nthose of a modified standard design bearing tested\npreviously.\nBearing temperatures and heat generation increased as expected with increased shaft speed. The\nhighest temperatures measured were at the cup outer\nsurface. With increased lubricant flow rates at both\nthe large and the small ends, bearing temperature\ndecreased, and heat generation increased. A total\nflow rate as low as 0.01 14 m3/min (3.0 gal/min) gave\nstable operating temperatures at 20 000 rpm without\nexcessive bearing heat generation. Decreasing oil-in\ntemperature from 364 to 350 K (195" to 170" F)\ndecreased bearing temperature 6 to 14 K (10" to\n25" F). Cup cooling was effective in decreasing the\nhigh cup temperatures to levels equal to the cone\ntemperature. The effect of load on bearing\ntemperatures was very small relative to the effects of\nspeed and flow rates.\n\nTapered-roller bearings are being used in some\nhelicopter transmissions to carry combined radial,\nthrust, and moment loads and, in particular, those\nloads from bevel gears such as high-speed input pinions. For this application tapered-roller bearings\nhave greater load capacity for a given envelope or for\na given bearing weight than the more commonly used\nball and cylindrical roller bearings. But speed limitations have restricted the use of tapered-roller bearings to lower speed applications compared with ball\nand cylindrical-roller bearings. The speed limitation\nis primarily due to the cone-rib-roller-large-end contact, which requires very careful lubrication and\ncooling consideration for high speed operation. The\nspeed of tapered roller bearings is limited to approximately 0.5 million DN (a cone-rib tangential velocity\nof approximately 36 m/sec (7000 ft/min)) unless\nspecial attention is given to lubricating and designing\nthis cone-rib-roller-end contact. At higher speeds\ncentrifugal effects starve this critical contact of\nlubricant.\nBy supplying lubricant directly to this critical contact through holes in the cone, tapered-roller bearings have been successfully operated to 1.81 million\nDN under heavy combined radial and thrust loads\n(ref. 1). Under thrust-load-only conditions (ref. 2)\nspeeds as high as 3.5 million DN have been successfully attained.\nThe internal geometry of the bearings used in these\ntests (refs. 1 and 2) were standard catalog series\ndesigns with modifications of the roller spherical\nends and lubrication holes through the cone. Also,\nsome of the bearings used in reference 2 had cages\ndesigned for high-speed operation, and the rollers,\ncones, and cups were made of CBS l000M material.\nThe use of computer programs can increase the\ncapability of designing and analyzing tapered-roller\nbearings for high-speed applications. These programs, described in references 3 and 4, take into account the difficulty of lubricating the contacts in\nhigh-speed tapered roller bearings and consider the\neffects of the elastohydrodynamic (EHD) films in\nthese contacts. The analysis of reference 3 was used\nto select the internal geometry for the high-speed\n\ndesign tapered roller bearing used for the research\nreported herein.\nThe objective of this research was to determine the\noperating characteristics, including temperature\ndistribution and heat generation, of a computer optimized, high-speed-design, 120.65-mm (4.75-in .)\nbore tapered roller bearing at speeds to 20 000 rpm\n(2.4 million DN). The cone-rib tangential velocity at\nthis speed was 158 m/sec (31 200 ftlmin). Independent test variables were shaft speed, radial and thrust\nloads, lubricant flow rate, and lubricant inlet\ntemperature. The results were compared with the\noperating characteristics of modified standard test\nbearings reported in references 1 and 5 .\n\nApparatus and Procedure\nTest Rig\nMechanical arrangement.-The test rig used for\nthis study was that described in reference 1 except for\nan improved spindle design with closer spacing of the\ntwo test bearings. The 75-kilowatt (100-hp) motor\nwas replaced with a 93-kilowatt (125-hp) motor with\nimproved starting torque characteristics required for\nthe higher speed testing. Figure 1 shows both a\ncutaway drawing and a photograph of the test rig.\nThe hollow spindle contained annular grooves to\ndistribute the lubricant to radial holes at both the\nlarge and small ends of the test bearing (fig. 2). A stationary lubrication tube delivered the desired lubricant flow to the annular grooves. Lubricant flow\nrates were varied by the varying supply pressures and\nhole sizes in the lubricant tube. For the tests reported\nherein jet lubrication was not used. The lubrication\nsystem, including pumps, filters, flowmeters, and\nload actuators, is described in detail in reference 5 .\nInstrumentation. -Thermocouples were installed\nfor temperature measurements of each test bearing\ncup, each cylindrical load bearing outer ring, and oil\ninlet and outlet temperatures on both test and load\nbearings. Temperatures of the cone bore and cone\nface of the test bearing on the drive end of the test\nspindle were measured with thermocouples and\ntransmitted with a frequency modulated (FM)\ntelemetry system.\nThe test rig vibration level is measured with\npiezoelectric accelerometers which automatically\nshut down the test when vibration exceeds a predetermined level because of bearing failures. Proximity\nprobes measure shaft excursion in two planes as well\nas shaft speed and test bearing separator speed. A\npower meter was incorporated to monitor test rig\npower requirements. Preset safety flow switches and\noil level switches were used to shut down the test rig\nin the event of lubrication system malfunction.\nL\n\n\'Machine frame\nCD-12061-38\n\nFigure L\n\n-\n\nHigh-speed tapered roller bearing test rig.\n\nO I L OUT\n\nCUP COOLING\nOUT IN\n\nt\n\nTEMV"I\nHRCX\nX\nJ\nLOCATIONS\n\nt l\n\n?=?\n\n,\nI\n\n,\n\nI\n\n\'\nL\n\nANNULAR\n\nSPINDLE\n\n__\n\nGROOVES\n\nI\n0\n\nhe\n\nr\n\nI\n\nCONF-RllRE\n- - ..- - -. ,\nTHERMOCOIUPLE\n\nLUBRICATION TUBE\n\n__\n\nTest Bearings\n\n1\n\nThe tapered roller test bearings had a bore of\n120.65 iiini (4.75 i n . ) . The remainder of the bearing\ninternal geomerry and external dimensions were\nselected by coinpuier optiinization with due consideration for econuinical manufacturing uqing existing tooling.\nThe computer analy\\i\\ of reference 3 mas used to\nselect optimum cup and roller angles and roller \\ire\nwith a fixed bore of 120.65 m m (4.75 i n . ) for conditions of a 26 700 N (6000 Ib) radial load. a 5 300 N\n(12 000 Ib) thrust load, and a range of shaft speeds\nfrom 12 500 to 20 OOO rpm. The analysi5 u t reference\n3 requires complete definition of a tapered roller\nbearing and its immediate environment. The optimization process using this analysis consisted of\nevaluating over 30 selected combinations of cup and\nroller angles and roller diameters, each defining a\nunique bearing internal geometry. These combinations were all within the constraints fixed by good\ndesign practice for tapered-roller bearings (ref. 3).\nCriteria for comparison were bearing fatigue life,\ntotal bearing heat generation, and cone-rib contact\nstress and heat generation. Greater consideration was\ngiven to those combinations which gave lower stress\nand heat generation at the cone-rib contact. Further\ndetails of the optimization variables are given in the\nappendix.\nThe geometry of the computer optimized design is\ngiven in table I . This geometry was reviewed by a\nbearing manufacturer to consider use of existing\n\ntooling for more economical manufacturing. As a\nresult, some compromise of the geometry was\nreached and checked with computer analysis to be\nsatisfactory. This selected geometry is shown in table\nI, along with the geometry of the standard bearing\ntested and reported in reference 1.\nThe rollers in the selected bearing were fully\ncrowned with a crown radius of 25.4 m (loo0 in.) and\na spherical end radius equal to 80 percent of the apex\nlength. The material of the cup, cone, and rollers was\ncase-carburized, consumable-electrode, vacuummelted CBS 1OOOM. The cage was one-piece machined AIS1 4340 steel with silver plating and was\nguided by lands on the cone. The hardnesses, case\ndepth, and surface finishes specifications are shown\nin table 11.\nThe cone contained 40 1.016-mm (0.040-in.)\ndiameter oil holes at each end. The holes were drilled\nthrough from a manifold on the cone bore to the\nundercuts at each raceway end, as shown in figure 2.\nIn addition, six oil holes were drilled at each end to\nlubricate the cage land riding surfaces.\nThe basic dynamic load ratings for this bearing are\n70 700 N (15 900 Ib) radial load and 5 1 600 N (1 1 600\nlb) thrust load (the thrust or radial load which gives\n10 percent life of 90 million cone revolutions). The\nAntifriction Bearing Manufacturers Association\n(AFBMA) basic dynamic capacity is 255 000 N\n(57 400 Ib). This bearing has approximately 10 percent less capacity than the standard bearing of\nreference 5 because of its optimization of performance at higher speeds.\n\nLubricant\nThe oil used for these studies was a 5-centistoke\nneopentylpolyol (tetra) ester. This type I1 oil is\nqualified to MIL-L-23699 as well as to the internal\noil specifications of most major aircraft turbine\nengine manufacturers. Properties of the oil are\npresented in table 111.\n\nProcedure\nThe test procedure was adjusted according to the\ntest conditions to be evaluated. Generally, a program\ncycle was defined that would allow the evaluation of\na number of conditions without a major interruption. Test parameters such as load, speed, and oil inlet temperature were held constant while the tester\nwas in operation. Lubricant flow rates were adjusted\nduring operation. The test bearings were allowed to\nreach an equilibrium condition before data were\nrecorded and the next test condition was sought.\n3\n\nTABLE I .\n.-\n\n- TEST BEARING GEOMETRY\n\n_ ..\n. .\n\n.\n\nComputer\noptimized\nbearing\n-\n\nDimension\n--\n\n.-\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRoller half angle\n\n.\n\n15\'53l\n\n1\'30\'\n\nRoller large end diameter, mm (in. ) 18.42 (0.725)\n\nStandard\nbearinga\n\n- .\n.\n\n15O\n\nCup half angle\n\n.\n\nSelected\nbearing\n\n17\'\n\n1\'35\'\n\n1\'35\n\n18.29 (0.720)\n\n18.29 (0.720\n\n22\n\n23\n\n2i\n\nTotal roller length, mm (in.)\n\n37.31 (1.469)\n\n54.18 (1.3456)\n\n54.17 (1.3452\n\nPitch diameter, mm (in.)\n\n155.5 (0.123)\n\n155.1 (6.105)\n\n166.8 (6.569\n\n192.3 (7.571)\n\n190.5 (7.500)\n\n206.4 (8.125\n\nNumber of rollers\n\nBearing outside diameter, mm (in.)\n~\n\n.\n.\n\n__\n\n.\n\n__.-.\n\n~\n\n._\n\naBearing used in tests of refs. 1 and 5.\n\nTABLE II.\n\n- TEST BEARING SPECIFICATIONS\n.\n-\n\n__\n\n. . . . . . . . . . .

Lubricant was supplied through holes\nat both the small and large ends of the cone as shown\nin figure 2. No jet lubrication was used.\nTemperatures of the 120.6"\n(4.7541.) bore\ntapered roller test bearing at the drive end of the test\nspindle were measured on the cone bore and the cone\nface as well as on the outer surface of the cup. Oilout temperatures were also measured. Test spindle\nspeeds ranged from 6000 to 20 000 rpm. Thrust loads\nvaried from 26 700 to 53 400 N (6OOO to 12 000.Ib).\nRadial loads varied from 13 300 to 26 700 N (3000 to\n6OOO Ib). The calculated maximum Hertz stresses at\nseveral of these conditions are shown in table IV.\nTotal lubricant flow rates varied from 0.0038 to\n0.0151 m3/min (1.0 to 4.0 gal/min).\nTest bearing temperatures a n d oil-out\ntemperatures, measured at these conditions, are\nshown in figures 3 to 6. Figures 3 and 4 show very little effect of radial or thrust load on cone-face\ntemperature. These data are typical throughout the\nrange of variables; that is, regardless of speed, oil-in\ntemperature, or flow rates, load had little effect on\nbearing or oil-out temperature.

The large\neffect of small-end flow rate on cone-bore\ntemperature at the higher speeds (figs. 6(d) and (e))\nindicates its effectiveness in cooling the cone.\nIt is apparent that, for speeds in the range of\n15 OOO to 20 000 rpm, flow rates of 0.0076 m3/min\n(2.0 gal/min) at the large end and 0.0038 m3/min (1 .O\ngal/min) at the small end are near optimum for this\ndesign and size of bearing.

The greater effect of\nspeed on cup outer surface temperature than on\ncone-bore temperature is readily apparent. As will be\nshown later, cup cooling can be used to decrease the\nhigh cup temperatures at the higher speeds. It should\nbe noted that the oil-out temperature increases with\nspeed at about the same rate as the cup outer-surface\ntemperature. Such a great increase in temperature\nwith speed should not be attributed to greater centrifugal loading of the rollers on the cup since load\nhas been shown to have a minor effect on\n\nb\n\n:\n\nOIL-IN\nTEMPERATURE,\n\n--0\n\n-\n\nK\n\n(Of)\n\n350 (1701\n364 (1951\nCONEFACE\nCONE BORE\nCUP OUTER SURFACE\nOILOUT\n\n0\nA\n0\n\n300\n\n360\n\nI\n\nI\n(a) Shaft speed, 12 500 rpm.\n\n370\n5000\n\n10 ooo\n15000\nSHAFT SPEED, r p m\n\n2oooO\n\nr\n\n3@ r\n\n4% -\n\nF i g u r e 7. - Effect of shaft speed on bearing a n d oil-out temperatures.

Also, since the cage is guided on lands\non the cone, greater heat generation at those guiding\nsurfaces at higher speeds is expected, along with\nhigher cone temperature. Apparently, the lubricant\nflow through the holes in the cone (both large and\nsmall ends) very adequately cools the cone, and by\nthe time it reaches the cup raceway, it has been\nheated appreciably and has less cooling capacity.\nThe test bearing cage speed was measured at all\nshaft speed conditions. The ratio of cage speed to\nshaft speed did not vary more than 1 percent from a\nnominal value of 0.445 throughout the range of\nspeed, load, and lubricant flow conditions.\nStable operating temperatures were achieved at all\nspeed, load, and lubricant flow rate conditions.\nSome of the lower lubricant flow rate points were not\nattempted at 20 OOO rpm due to anticipated excessive\ntemperatures. Observations of the bearings after tests\nat 20 OOO rpm showed no signs of surface distress on\nthe roller-raceway or roller/cone-rib contacting surfaces. Likewise, cage contacting surfaces showed no\nabnormal wear or distress.\n\nmLL\n\nx\n\nd\n\n420 -\n\nd\n\n2\nL\n\nB\nn\n\nP\n\n5\nc\n\n2@-\n\n240 -\n\n220 -\n\n410-\n\n400-\n\n390 380 -\n\n1\n\n370\n.004\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n.008\n\nI\n\n0 J\n\n012\nTOTAL FLOW, m3imin\n\nI\n\n,016\n\nu\n\n2\n3\nTOTAL FLOW; gallmin\n\n4\n\n(bl Shafl speed, 18 500 rpm.\n\nfigure 8 - Effect of oil-in temperature on bearing and oilout temperatures.

In figure 8(a)\ntemperatures at an oil-in temperature of 350 K (170"\nF) and 12 500 rpm shaft speed are shown compared\nwith data from figure 5(b) at a 364 K (195" F) oil-in\ntemperature. At the lower oil-in temperature, bearing\nand oil-out temperatures generally were 6 to 14 K\n(10" to 18" F) less than at the higher oil-in\ntemperature. Least affected was the cone bore\ntemperature.\nIn figure 8(b) similar data are shown for a shaft\nspeed of 18 500 rpm. Here the temperatures were\ngenerally 6 to 14 K (10" to 25" F) lower for the lower\noil-in temperatures and least affected was the cup\nouter surface temperature. Also, the cone-bore\ntemperature was decreased the full 14 K (25" F) of\nthe decrease in oil-in temperature. Generally, for\nboth shaft speeds, the bearing and oil-out\ntemperatures were affected slightly more by oil-in\ntemperature at the higher flow rates.\n\nEffect of Cup Cooling\nAs was shown in figure 7, the highest bearing\ntemperatures measured were at the cup outer surface,\nand the difference from cone temperatures was increasingly greater at higher speeds. The higher cup\ntemperatures may be decreased with the use of cup\ncooling oil flowing in contact with the outer surface\nof the cup (as shown in fig. 2). Figure 9 shows the effects of cup cooling flows up to 0.0028 m3/min (0.75\ngal/min) at 12 500 and 18 500 rpm and a 350 K\n(170" F) oil-in temperature. As expected, greatest\neffects were at the cup outer surface where\ntemperatures were decreased 11 K (20" F) with a cup\ncooling flow of 0.0019 m3/min (0.5 gal/min) at\n18 500 rpm. Higher cooling flows had little or no\neffect.\nLimited data were obtained at 18 500 rpm and an\noil-in temperature of 364 K (195" F). As shown in\ntable V, a cup cooling flow rate of 0.0038 m3/min\n(1.0 gal/min) was sufficient to lower the cup outer\nsurface 14 K (25 deg F) or to a level equal to the conebore temperature.\n\n0 CONEFACE\n0 CONE BORE\n\nA CUP OUTER SURFACE\n0 OIL OUT\n\n400\n\n390\n\n380\n\nD\n\nCUP COOLING OIL OUT\n\nP--\n\n3701A;--_,\n360\n\n(a) Shaft speed, 12 500 rpm.\n\n"r\n\nT\n390\n\nCUP COOLING FLOW, m 3 / m i n\n\nI\n0\n\n.25\n\nI\n\n.50\n\n1\n.75\n\nCUP COOLING FLOW, g a l l m i n\n(bJ Shaft speed; 18 500 rpm.\n\nBearing Power Loss\nThe power loss from the bearing is dissipated in the\nform of heat by conduction to the lubricant and by\nconvection and radiation to the surrounding environment.

The effect\nof shaft speed can be closely approximated by the\nrelation Q ~ a R n . 3 5\nwhere N i s the shaft speed in rpm.\nThese increases are expected because of the increased\nlubricant drag or churning.

Loads and\ntotal flow rates were over the same range as those\nreported herein for the high-speed design bearing.\nMajor differences in the two bearing designs were\nsmaller cup angle, smaller pitch a n d outside\ndiameters, and fewer rollers in the high-speed design\n(table I). The cage of the high-speed design bearing\nwas made to be guided by lands on the cone;\nwhereas, the standard bearing had a stamped steel\ncage made to be guided by the rollers and was of\nlesser strength for high-speed operation.\nLubricant to the large end of the standard bearing\nwas directed through holes in the cone to the cone-rib\nsurface; lubricant to the small end was through a pair\nof jets directed at the small end of the rollers. Comparisons herein were made with equal flow rates for\nboth bearings at both the large end and the small end.\nAt the small end, a constant 0.0038 m3/min (1.0\ngal/min) was used, and that was fed through jets for\nthe standard design and through the cone small end\nfor the high-speed design.\nMaterials with higher temperature capabilities\nwere used for the high-speed design bearings: Cups,\ncones, and rollers were made of CBS-lOOOM, and the\ncage was AISI 4340. The standard design bearing, on\n\nFigure 12 - Cone face temperatures for high-speed design\ncompared with those for standard design.

The symbols\nare used only to identify the curves at each flow rate.\nAt 15 000 rpm, the high-speed-design bearing\noperates 8 to 11 K (15" to 20" F) cooler than the standard design. The improvement at 6000 rpm,\nhowever, is much less. The cup outer surface\ntemperature is also lower for the high-speed-design\nbearing as shown in figure 13, although the improvement is slightly less than that at the cone face.\nAlso shown in figure 10 are data for the standard\ndesign bearing showing heat transferred to the lubricant at 6000 and 15 OOO rpm. The high-speed-design\nbearing has lower heat generation, as represented by\nheat transferred to the lubricant, than the standard\ndesign bearing at both speeds. As shown in figure 11,\nthe improvement with the high-speed design is approximately 16 percent throughout the range of 6OOO\nto 15 OOO rpm.\n\nSummary of Results\nThe performance of 120.65"\n(4.75411.) bore,\ncomputer-optimized, high-speed-design, tapered-\n\nDESIGN\n-- HIGH-SPEEDDESIGN (ref.\nSTANDARD\n\n460-\n\n51\n\nTOTAL FLOW\nRATE,\n\n3~r\nI\n\nA\n\n0.0076\n\n(2.0)\n\n340\n\n0\n0\n\n.0114\n.0151\n\n(3.0)\n(4.0)\n\nc 47-\n\nn\n\nm3lmin (gallmin)\n\nE\n\nc\n3\n0\nP\nV\nx\n\n240\n\nL\nm\n\n20 000\n\n10 Mw)\n\n15 000\nSHAFT SPEED, r p m\n\nFigure 13. - Cup outer surface temperatures for highspeed design compared with those for standard design.\nThrust Imd. 53 400 N (12 OM] Ibl; radial load, 26 700 N\n(6000 Ib); oil-in te erature, 364 K (195\' F); small end\nflow rate, Q 0 0 3 8 m I m i n (1.OgallminL\n\nY.\n\nroller bearings was investigated at shaft speeds up to\n20 OOO rpm (cone-rib tangential velocitieg up to 158\nm/sec (3 1 200 ft/min)).

Test\nconditions included shaft speeds from 6OOO to 20 OOO\nrpm, radial loads from 13 300 t o 26 700 N (3000 to\n6OOO lb), thrust loads from 26 700 t o 53 400 N (6OOO\nto 12 000 Ib), lubricant flow rates from 0.0038 to\n0.0151 m3/min (1 .O to 4.0 gal/min), and lubricant inlet temperatures of 350 and 364 K (170" and 195" F).\nThe following results were obtained:\n1. The computer-optimized, high-speed-design,\ntapered-roller bearing operated successfully at shaft\nspeeds up to 20 OOO rpm under heavy thrust and\nradial loads. Stable temperatures were reached, and\nno surface distress was observed.\n2. Bearing temperatures and heat generation with\nthe high-speed-design bearing were significantly less\nthan those of a modified standard bearing tested\npreviously.\n3. Bearing temperatures and heat generation increased with increased shaft speed. The highest\ntemperatures measured were at the cup outer surface.\n4. With increased lubricant flow rates (either large\nend or small end), bearing temperatures decreased\nand heat generation increased. A total flow rate as\nlow as 0.0114 m3/min (3.0 gal/min) gave stable\noperating temperatures at 20 OOO rpm without excessive bearing heat generation.\n5 . Decreasing oil-in temperature from 364 K (195"\nF) to 350 K (170" F) decreased bearing temperatures\n6 to 14 K (10" to 25" F).\n6.

Abstract\n\nThe performance of 120.65-mm (4.75-in. ) bore high-speed-design, tapered-roller bearings\nwas investigated at shaft speeds to 20 000 r p m (2.4 million DN) under combined thrust and\nradial load. The test bearing design was computer optimized for high-speed operation.\nTemperature distribution and bearing heat generation were determined as a function of shaft\nspeed, radial and thrust loads, lubricant flow rates, and lubricant inlet temperature. The\nhigh-speed-design, tapered-roller bearing operated successfully at shaft speeds up to 20 000\nr p m under heavy thrust and radial loads. Bearing temperatures and heat generation with the\nhigh-speed-design bearing were significantly l e s s than those of a modified standard bearing\ntested previously. Cup cooling was effective in decreasing the high cup temperatures to levels\nequal to the cone temperature.\n\n7. Key Words (Suggested by Authorls))\n\n18.
