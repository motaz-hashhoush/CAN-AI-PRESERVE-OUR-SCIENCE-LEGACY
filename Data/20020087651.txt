b'Industrial Productivity\nand Manufacturing\nTechnology\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Materials and Manufacturing Center (MMTC) of TRW Inc., which has\nsincebecome MMTCITextron, Cleveland, Ohio,\nconducted a research program for Lewis\nResearch Center involving use of "thermal\nbarrier" coatings to improve aircraft engine\nefficiency and reduce fuel consumption. The\ncoatings, applied to turbine blades, combustors\nand other engine parts, allowed increasing the\noperating temperature of an engine by several\nhundred degrees, thus increasing overall\nefficiency.\nFor applying the coatings, MMTC invented\na computer-aided, fully automatic robotic system for spraying a very hot plasma onto a\nturbine blade (right).MMTC also found it necessary to develop a means of controlling the\nthickness of the plasma deposit, which is\nmeasured in thousandths of an inch. This led to\ndevelopment of advanced optical gaging techniques to monitor and control point-to-point\nplasma spray deposition buildup on the surfaces of turbine blades.\nThese optical gaging techniques became\nthe basis for a family of computerized optical\ngages built by MMTC for inspecting aircraft or\nindustrialturbine and compressorblades, vanes\nand other parts of complex shape. MMTCJ\nTextron offers 10 standard commercial robotic\ngages,including theTextronModel501Bshown\nat far right; it is in production use for in-process\nand final inspection of compressor blades and\nvanes. In addition to measuring and analyzing\nthe airfoils in three dimensions, the system\ngenerates two dimensional profiles for assessing the status of-and specifying repairs tothe electrochemical machining cathodes used\nto make the parts. The Model 501B, and other\nsimilar systems, are capable of production floor\naccuracies to a ten-thousandth of an inch at\nspeeds much faster than coordinate measuring\nmachines.\n\nManufacturing\nAids\n\nMMTCJTextron is now marketing an expanded line of advanced optical gages for high\nprecision, complex geometry applications on\nblades, vanes, integrally bladed rotors, impellers, integrally cast stators and other turbine\nparts. The gages employ laser, fiber optic or\nstructured light video camera sensors as the\napplicationdictates. At lower right is one member of the new family, the Textron Model 6000.\nThese spinoff gages, says MMTCITextron,\nnot only offer multiple improvements in controlling the quality of manufactured parts, they\nalso provide significant savings in the overall\ncost of the manufacturing process.\n\n'
