NASA is conducting research and development of Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) technologies which may potentially mitigate low visibility conditions as a causal factor to these accidents while replicating the operational benefits of clear day flight operations, regardless of the actual outside visibility condition. Two experimental evaluation studies were performed to determine the efficacy of two concepts: 1) head-worn display application of SVS technology to enhance transport aircraft surface operations, and 2) three-dimensional SVS electronic flight bag display concept for flight plan preview, mission rehearsal and controller-pilot data link communications interface of flight procedures. In the surface operation study, pilots evaluated two display devices and four display modes during taxi under unlimited and CAT II visibility conditions. In the mission rehearsal study, pilots flew approaches and departures in an operationally-challenged airport environment, including CFIT scenarios. Performance using the SVS concepts was compared to traditional baseline displays with paper charts only or EFB information. In general, the studies evince the significant situation awareness and enhanced operational capabilities afforded from these advanced SVS display concepts. The experimental results and conclusions from these studies are discussed along with future directions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20060013126, "endDate": "2006-04-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Society for Optical Engineering", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "273b9e09a1664767b9d34753e044e6b1", "id": "56f9d081b2984b2bb81357affd33e621"}], "name": "SPIE Defense and Security Symposium 2006", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "273b9e09a1664767b9d34753e044e6b1", "startDate": "2006-04-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060013126, "id": "eefc8ae6dd0d49a2ba0029b4ac7a7c30", "publicationDate": "2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20060013126.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20060013126/downloads/20060013126.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20060013126/downloads/20060013126.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20060013126/downloads/20060013126.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
