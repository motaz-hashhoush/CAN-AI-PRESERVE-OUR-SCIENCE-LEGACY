The module includes an expressions-parser submodule built on top\nof an analytical system, enabling the user\nto define logical and numerical variables\nand constants. The variables can capture\noutput from SOAP orbital-prediction\nand geometric-engine computations.\nThe module can combine variables and\nconstants with built-in logical operators\n(such as Boolean AND, OR, and NOT),\nrelational operators (such as >, <, or =),\nand mathematical operators (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, differentiation, and integration). Parentheses\ncan be used to specify precedence of operations.\nThe module contains a library of\nmathematical functions and operations,\nincluding logarithms, trigonometric\nfunctions, Bessel functions, minimum/maximum operations, and floating-point-to-integer conversions. The\nmodule supports combinations of time,\ndistance, and angular units and has a dimensional-analysis component that\nchecks for correct usage of units. A\nparser based on the Flex language and\nthe Bison program looks for and indicates errors in syntax. SOAP expressions\ncan be built using other expressions as\narguments, thus enabling the user to\nbuild analytical trees. A graphical user\ninterface facilitates use.\nThis program was developed by Robert Carnright, David Stodden, Jim Paget, and John\nCoggi of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\n18\n\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

In this\nenvironment, enhanced functionality\nand autonomy of navigation, guidance,\nand control systems of a spacecraft are\nprovided by a virtual satellite \xe2\x80\x94 that is, a\ncomputational model that simulates the\ndynamic behavior of the spacecraft.\nWithin this environment, it is possible\nto execute any associated software, the\ndevelopment of which could benefit\nfrom knowledge of, and possible interaction (typically, exchange of data)\nwith, the virtual satellite. Examples of associated software include programs for\nsimulating spacecraft power and thermal-management systems. This environment is independent of the flight hardware that will eventually host the flight\nsoftware, making it possible to develop\nthe software simultaneously with, or\neven before, the hardware is delivered.\nOptionally, by use of interfaces included\nin VirtualSat, hardware can be used instead of simulated. The flight software,\ncoded in the C or C++ programming\nlanguage, is compilable and loadable\ninto VirtualSat without any special modifications. Thus, VirtualSat can serve as a\nrelatively inexpensive software test-bed\nfor development test, integration, and\npost-launch maintenance of spacecraft\nflight software.\nThis program was written by Stephan R.\nHammers of the Hammers Co., Inc. for Goddard Space Flight Center.

These constructs\nallow the user to characterize satellite\npath and instrument cover information\nfor small bodies in both 3D display and\nnumerical output formats.\nTri-axial ellipsoids are geometric\nshapes the diameters of which are different in each of three principal x, y, and z\ndimensions. This construct provides a\nbetter approximation than using\nspheres or oblate spheroids (ellipsoids\ncomprising two common equatorial diameters as a distinct polar diameter).\nHowever, the tri-axial ellipsoid is considerably more difficult to work with from a\nmodeling perspective. In addition, the\nSOAP small-body extensions allow the\nuser to actually employ a plate model for\nhighly irregular surfaces. Both tri-axial\nellipsoids and plate models can be assigned to coordinate frames, thus allowing for the modeling of arbitrary\nchanges to body orientation.\nA variety of features have been extended to support tri-axial ellipsoids, including the computation and display of\nthe spacecraft sub-orbital point, ground\ntrace, instrument footprints, and\nswathes. Displays of 3D instrument volumes can be shown interacting with the\nellipsoids. Longitude/latitude grids,\ncontour plots, and texture maps can be\ndisplayed on the ellipsoids using a variety of projections. The distance along an\narbitrary line of sight can be computed\nbetween the spacecraft and the ellipsoid,\nand the coordinates of that intersection\ncan be plotted as a function of time. The\nsmall-body extension supports the same\nvisual and analytical constructs that are\nsupported for spheres and oblate spheroids in SOAP making the implementation of the more complex algorithms\nlargely transparent to the user.\nThis work was done by Robert Carnright of\nCaltech and David Stodden and John Coggi\nof The Aerospace Corporation for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.
