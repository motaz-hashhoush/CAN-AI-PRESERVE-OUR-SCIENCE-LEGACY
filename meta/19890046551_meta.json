The subjects of these studies are (1) an expedition to the Martian moon Phobos; (2) a three-mission expedition to Mars; (3) the construction of a man-tended lunar observatory; and (4) the construction of a lunar outpost to serve as the basis for construction of a Martian outpost. The fourth alternative would follow the recommendation of the National Commission on Space for the creation of a 'bridge between worlds' in which explorers would develop ways in which to 'live off the land' in a space environment.", "title": "Exploration case studies", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T01:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890046551, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Underwood, Jimmy M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Office of Exploration", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "id": "c0092e645a1f4bb79c12da6b3359613c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890046551, "publications": [{"volume": "27", "submissionId": 19890046551, "issn": "0740-722X", "id": "4bfd2951307042cfbad21776a00f57ee", "publicationName": "Aerospace America", "publicationDate": "1989-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
