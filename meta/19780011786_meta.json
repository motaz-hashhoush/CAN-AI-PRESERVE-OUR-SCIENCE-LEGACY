It was concluded that private pilots need to be more knowledgeable about weather. Improvement is needed in providing general aviation pilots with changes in the weather reporting and forecasting systems. There should also be some simulation of various severe shear profiles in training simulators, although there is still a problem in simulating shear conditions using mathematical models and data.", "title": "Summary report of Committee B", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T15:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780011786, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lenschow, D.
