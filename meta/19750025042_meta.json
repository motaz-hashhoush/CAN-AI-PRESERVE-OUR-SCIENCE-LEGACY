The total program verification effort assures the accuracy and adequacy of the LVDC flight program and verifies that the final program meets mission requirements and conforms to program documentation. The flight program's functional requirements to integrate the guidance and control system with the launch vehicle sequencing system are verified directly by analysis of many special logic checks designed for this purpose and indirectly by the correct overall program response to nominal and numerous perturbed conditions. Verification of the interaction of function requirements is accomplished on every case run during the verification effort.", "title": "General verification description", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T02:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19750025042, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750025042, "id": "927a230ad7cd4aeca91b0ad51e5053b7", "publicationName": "Program Verification Doc. for the ASTP Flight Program", "publicationDate": "1975-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19750025041, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Program verification document for the ASTP flight program", "stiType": "CONTRACTOR_REPORT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
