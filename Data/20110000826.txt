If the error detection\nchecking indicates that there was an error, then that indicates\na collision between two or more packets.\nIf there were a collision, that would indicate that at least\ntwo terminals were attempting to transmit on the return frequency at the same time. In order to minimize the possibility\nof a second collision, each terminal waits a random period of\ntime before attempting retransmission. This aids significantly\nin reducing collisions on retransmissions.\nA modified version, called Slotted ALOHA, was introduced to increase efficiency. The hub would send out a timing\npulse which created time slots. Any terminal that had data to\nsend had to transmit within a predetermined period after\nreceipt of the pulse. This modification increased efficiency by\nlimiting the possibly for a collision to only the small scheduled period of time after the timing pulse.\nThe next expansion of the ALOHA protocol was a multichannel slotted ALOHA (MCSA). This protocol includes\nmultiple reverse channels for communication from the\nremote terminals to the hub.\nThese multiple channels can be accomplished by several\nmeans. Two of the most common methods are the spread\nspectrum technology methods of Direct Sequence Spread\nSpectrum (DS/SS) and Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum\n(FHSS).\nIn addition, the reverse channels of MCSA can be implemented using series of narrowband channels each operating\non separate frequency.\nIn either case, the addition of multiple channels to the\nALOHA protocol, reduces the chance for collision by having\nmore data paths available for original transmissions and\nretransmission of lost packets. Just like original transmissions, retransmissions use a random access contention access\nmethod to the reverse channels.\nIf we assume all the channels are operating at the same low\nload of G-0.1 and a message length equal to nine slots, the\nprobability of success on the first transmission attempt is only\n0.41. This means that only 41% of the messages can be\ndelivered in the first try, i.e. with propagation delay of 250 ms.\nThe remaining 59% of the messages will incur retransmissions and the message delay will be at least 750 ms (include\nthe timeout period and another round trip propagation delay).\nTherefore in a GEO satellite network with a large propagation\ndelay, the multi-channel slotted Aloha cannot deliver multislot short messages very quickly.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL\nVIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nInternet traffic is shifting to shorter transaction based communications to accommodate such activities as retail Pointof-Sale (POS) transactions, mouse clicks, http requests and\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) synchronization packets. In order to decrease message latency a three-step\nimprovement is implemented. One is to use a packet level\nforward error correction (PLFEC) protocol which will\nincrease the number of the messages that can be reconstructed\nby the hub without retransmission. The second step is to\nimplement a selective retransmission algorithm so that if the\nnumber of packets lost is too large for reconstruction, then\nonly the minimum number of packets needed for reconstruction by the PLFEC protocol is retransmitted. The third step is\nto reserve one or more of the return channels of the MCSA for\nthe retransmissions, which essentially guarantees that the\nminimum number of packets needed for reconstruction of the\nmessage will be received on the second transmission.\n\nHaving just described the invention in general terms, other\nand further objects, features, and advantages of the invention\nwill be made more explicit from the following detailed\ndescription taken with reference to the drawings, which are\nnot necessarily drawn to scale, and wherein:\nFIG. 1 is a diagrammatic depiction of a general satellite\n10 communication configuration of the prior art;\nFIG. 2 is a diagrammatic depiction of the Packet Level\nForward Error Correction protocol as used in the present\ninvention; and\nFIG. 3 is a diagrammatic depiction of the enhanced satellite\n15 communications protocol of the present invention.\n5\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\nThe following discussion is premised on the use of geosta20 tionary satellites. Though such use would be typical, the\nscope of the present invention is not predicated on use with\ngeostationary satellites.\n1. Forward Error Correction and Automatic Repeat Requests\n25 PLFEC is a technique that allows for the reconstruction of\nmissed packets when messages of k packets need to be transmitted. Forward error correction refers to an encoding\nscheme that allows the entire original message to be reconstructed without necessarily having received the entire\n30 encoded message. Once the minimum number of packets\nneeded to reconstruct the message is received, the remainder\nof the packets in the message can be ignored.\nA PLFEC encoding scheme generates parity information\nwhich is assembled into parity packets based upon various\n35 bits from each of the packets in a message. For example, an\nencoding scheme might generate a first byte of a parity packet\nbased upon an encoding scheme which utilizes the first byte\nof each packet in the message. This is referred to as an intrapacket encoding scheme.\n40 An original message of k packets in length is encoded\nunder a PLFEC algorithm to generate a total number of n\npackets of which a variable number are parity packets. Then\nthe k original message packets are sent first, followed by the\n(n-k) parity packets. Though it is more efficient to send the k\n45 original packets first, that isn\'t necessarily required, and the\npackets could be sent in any order.\nA typical encoding scheme can be described as FEC(20, 9)\nwhich indicates that the original message was 9 (k) packets\nlong and was encoded to a total of 20 (n) packets, which\n50 means that there were 11 (n-k, 20-9) parity packets. Any\nnumber of other encoding ratios can be used, including but\nnot limited to FEC (27, 9), FEC (34, 9), FEC (IS, 6) or FEC\n(36, 12). The preferred encoding scheme utilizes an n:k ratio\nof about 1:1.5 to about 1:4.\n55 The noisier the communications environment, the higher\nthe encoding ratio that should then be used. Thus an FEC (34,\n9) encoding ratio would be more appropriate for a very noise\nenvironment, because only 9 out the 34 encoded packets\nwould need to be received in order to reconstruct the message.\n60 The advantage of PLFEC is that even though a total of 20\npackets may be sent, only 9 need to be received without error\nin order for the message to be reconstructed by the Hub\n(assuming a FEC(20,9) encoding ratio). The total of 9 packets\ncould be any number of original message packets and any\n65 number of parity packets, as long as the total equals 9. Once\nthe Hub has received the minimum number of packets have\nbeen received correctly, an ACK is sent to the transmitting\n\nUS 7,827,459 B1\n5\nVSAT. Under this protocol, an ACK is only sent after the\nentire original message has been received or reconstructed.\nBecause error correction can be accomplished, even if\nsome packets are not received correctly, having the hub send\nan ACK after receipt of each packet would be a very ineffi- 5\ncient, especially considering the long propagation delay\ntimes for satellite communications.\nEach ACK transmission would require at least an additional 250 milliseconds and in view of the error correction\ncapabilities provide by PLFEC, would be unnecessary in io\nalmost all circumstances.\nEven if there were a collision rate of 55%, a 20-packet\nencoded message that had been encoded with a FEC(20, 9)\nscheme, could still be reconstructed because on average, 9\npackets would still arrive correctly. Thus only the original 15\ntransmission time would be required.\nIf the same collision rate were applied to a 9-packet nonencoded message under MCSA, then about 5 packets would\nsuffer collisions, and there a significant additional time delay\nwhich would include time-out periods, re-transmission of 20\neach of the missed packets and subsequent ACK transmissions.\nThe transmission status of eachmessage can fall into one of\nthree possible categories:\nCategory 1: If at least kpackets of the encoded message are 25\nreceived correctly, then all k of the original message packets\nhave been either received correctly or the message can be\nreconstructed by utilizing the parity packets if some of the\noriginal message packets have been lost. In this case there is\n30\nno need for a retransmission.\t\nCategory 2: A second alternative is that some of the packets\nhave been received, but not enough to properly reconstruct the\nmessage. This occurs if less than k packets out of the total n\nare received correctly. In this case a selective retransmission\nstrategy is utilized. Each of the transmitted packets contains 35\ninformation regarding the message ID number, the packet\nsequence number and total packets in the message. If even\none packet of the message is received properly by the hub,\nthen hub can determine which packets are missing. The hub\nthen reserves one or more of the return channels and sends an 40\nAcknowledgement Request (ARQ) to the proper VSAT to\nretransmit only those missing packets on the identified\nreserved channel. Because a specific channel have been\nreserved for this ARQ only, there won\'t be any collisions and\nthe balance of the needed packets will then be received by the 45\nhub on the second transmission attempt.\nThe following discussion is based upon a sample encoding\nscheme of FEC (5, 3) and is shown in FIG. 2. A three-packet\nmessage 200 is encoded into five code packets 210, which\nincludes the original 1-3 message packets 200 and two parity 50\npackets 205 numbered 4 and 5. The encoded message is sent\nin five consecutive time slots on one of the return channels.\nIf the two parity packets 4 and 5 are lost due to collisions\n(220a), then no error correction is needed and no retransmission is needed because all of the original message packets 55\nhave been received.\nIf two packets are lost and one or both of them are original\nmessage packets, (two examples are shown in 220b), then the\nhub can utilize the PLFEC encoding protocol to reconstruct\nthe message without the need for a retransmission. This is 60\npossible because at least three (k) packets were received\ncorrectly.\nThe last option occurs when three of the n encoded packets\nare lost due to collision. For example, if only the first (original\nmessage) and the fourth (parity) code packets (2" d example in 65\n220c) are received correctly, the hub will be able to determine\nfrom the correctly received packets, that the message length is\n\n6\nthree (k) and that the hub needs one more packet to in order to\nreconstruct the message. It then reserves one channel for this\nretransmission. After the terminal receives the information\nregarding which channel has been reserved for this ARQ, it\nsends an additional code packet such as the first code packet\non the reserved channel so that the hub will be able to reconstruct the message after it receives this one additional packet\non retransmission.\nThe first example in 220c shows that only two original\nmessage packets (1 and 3) were received. Therefore, if the\nARQ requests that packet 2 be retransmitted, no reconstruction of the message would be necessary upon receipt of the\nretransmitted packet 2. However, if packet 4 or 5 were\nrequested in the ARQ, then the PLFEC protocol would be\nnecessary to reconstruct the original message. There are\nadvantages to each option, and the protocol can be implemented to allow various choices during configuration of the\nprotocol about which type of packet(s) to be re-transmitted.\nCategory 3: The third alternative is that none of n encoded\npackets are successfully transmitted to the hub (not shown).\nThe hub has received no information that this message even\nexists. In this case, the VSAT will never receive either anACK\nor an ARQ from the hub. After a defined time-out period, the\nVSAT will start over andretransmit all of thepackets again. In\nessence, the first transmission never occurred.\nFIG. 3 shows all of the steps of the present invention. Step\n1 shows VSAT 1 sending an FEC encoded 5-packet message\nto the Hub on Channel A. As indicated, packets 2, 3 and 5\nwere subj ect to collisions and were not received without error.\nStep 2 shows the Hub sending an ARQ to VSAT 1 to resend\npacket 2 using channel C which as been reserved.\nStep 3 shows VSAT 1 retransmitting packet 2 on reserved\nchannel C. Because channel C is reserved, it is essentially\nguaranteed that packet 2 will be receive by the Hub correctly.\nThen, by use of the PLFEC protocol, the original message can\nbe reconstructed by the Hub Step 4. Once the message has\nbeen reconstructed correctly, the Hub sends anACK to VSAT\n1. Alternatively, if the message couldn\'t be reconstructed, for\nany reason, then the Hub could either send another ARQ to\nrequest at least k packets of the original encoded message be\nretransmitted or do nothing, in which case VSAT 1 would\ntime out because it hadn\'t received an ACK and would\nretransmit the message de novo.\nIt should be understood that even though the enhanced\ncommunications protocol of the present invention is most\nefficient when used with shorter messages, it does provide\nenhanced efficiency even with longer messages. It should also\nbe understood that the protocol of the present invention does\nnot have to be used in isolation and could be used as one of\ncombination of protocols in order to provide even more efficient communication.\nEven though the present invention has been discussed as\npart of a satellite communications protocol, it\'s improvement\nin communications can be utilized in any communications\napplication in which there are inherent propagation delays.\nTo those skilled in the art it will be understood that there\ncan be many other variations of the embodiments what have\nbeen described above while still achieving the same objectives of the invention. Such variations are intended to be\ncovered by the scope of this invention. As such, the foregoing\ndescription of embodiments of the invention is not intended to\nbe limiting.
