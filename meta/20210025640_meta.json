Both stocks have continued to decline in recent years, thus are a high\npriority for routine monitoring.\n\nNOAA\u2019s Marine Mammal laboratory (MML) has conducted aerial surveys of marine mammals throughout coastal Alaska to monitor trends in population abundance and distribution for more than 20 years. These surveys have typically been conducted from a twinengine aircraft, such as a DHC-6 Twin Otter, operated by NOAA pilots and crewmembers. Aerial surveys in the Aleutian Islands present significant challenges and higher risks due to their remoteness, rugged terrain, and extreme weather. To evaluate the feasibility of transitioning from manned to unmanned aerial surveys in this region, thereby reducing risks to NOAA personnel and high-value aircraft, we propose to conduct test survey flights in the Near Islands of Alaska using a medium-sized, fixed-wing UAV (NASA\u2019s SIERRA-B aircraft) with a nadir-aimed imaging payload.\n\nSurvey flights are planned to be conducted during daylight hours on days with VFR\nconditions and less than ~20 knot winds at altitudes of 800-1200 feet. Survey imagery, including\nthermal video and high-resolution color photos, would be collected at known Steller sea lion\nand harbor seal sites along the coastlines of Shemya, Nizki, Alaid, Agattu, and Attu Islands. The\nplanning team will request approval and support from the US Air Force to conduct this project\nat Eareckson Air Station (Shemya Island, AK) during the month of September 2022 when\nweather conditions in the western Aleutian Islands are expected to be optimal.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210025640, "id": "20915e43301b4e81a3befe3b97adb6f8", "publicationDate": "2021-12-31T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "NOAA Feasiblity Report.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210025640/downloads/NOAA%20Feasiblity%20Report.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210025640/downloads/NOAA%20Feasiblity%20Report.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210025640/downloads/NOAA%20Feasiblity%20Report.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
