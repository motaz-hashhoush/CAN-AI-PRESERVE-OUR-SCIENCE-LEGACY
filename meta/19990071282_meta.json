The 11-year cycles of both the numbers of sunspots and Earth geomagnetic storms were first noted by Sabine. A few years later, speculation on a causal relationship between flares and storms arose when Carrington reported that a large magnetic storm followed the great September 1859 solar flare. However, it was not until this century that a well-accepted statistical survey on large solar flares and geomagnetic storms was performed, and a significant correlation between flares and geomagnetic storms was noted. Although the two phenomena, one on the Sun and the other on the Earth, were statistically correlated, the exact physical linkage was still an unknown at this time. Various hypotheses were proposed, but it was not until interplanetary spacecraft measurements were available that a high-speed plasma stream rich in helium was associated with an intense solar flare. The velocity of the solar wind increased just prior to and during the helium passage, identifying the solar ejecta for the first time. Space plasma measurements and Skylab's coronagraph images of coronal mass elections (CMES) from the Sun firmly established the plasma link between the Sun and the Earth. One phenomenon associated with magnetic storms is brilliant \"blood\" red auroras, as shown.", "title": "Magnetic Storms", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T04:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990071282, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tsurutani, Bruce T."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA United States"}}, "id": "3569444475554e668561fd59f3fffe1d"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19990071282, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gonzalez, Walter D."}, "organization": {"name": "Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espacias", "location": "Sao Jose dos Campos,  Brazil"}}, "id": "205f3027851e443e8436303310bd8b50"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19990071282, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990071282, "id": "b029ad493eed4f6d83a7653c7baf02e4", "publicationName": "From the Sun: Auroras Magnetic Storms, Solar Flares, Cosmic Rays", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
