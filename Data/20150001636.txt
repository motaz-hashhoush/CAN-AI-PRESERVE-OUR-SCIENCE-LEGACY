But with 3-D printing\ntechnology, only two parts were\nrequired, saving time and money and\nallowing engineers to build parts that\nenhance rocket engine performance and\nare less prone to failure.\n\n28 element Inconel 625 fuel injector built using SLM process\n\nMetallic Aerospace Components\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough 3D printing, robust and highperforming engine parts can be created at a\nfraction of the cost and time of traditional\nmanufacturing methods,\xe2\x80\x9d\n"It\xe2\x80\x99s a very complex engine, and it was very\ndif\xef\xac\x81cult to form all the cooling channels, the\ninjector head, and the throttling mechanism.\nBeing able to print very high strength\nadvanced alloys ... was crucial to being able to\ncreate the SuperDraco engine as it is.\nCompared with a traditionally cast part, a\nprinted [part] has superior strength,\nductility, and fracture resistance, with a\nlower variability in materials properties.\n\nSpaceX SuperDraco combustion chamber for\nDragon V2 made from Inconel using the DMLS\nprocess\n\nMetallic Aerospace Components\nGE will install 19 fuel nozzles into each LEAP jet engine manufactured by\nCFM International, which is a joint venture between GE and France\xe2\x80\x99s\nSnecma. CFM has orders for 6000 LEAPs.\nLighter in weight \xe2\x80\x93 the weight of these nozzles will be 25% lighter than\nits predecessor part.\nSimpler design \xe2\x80\x93 reduced the number of brazes and welds from 25 to\njust \xef\xac\x81ve.\nNew design features \xe2\x80\x93 more intricate cooling pathways and support\nligaments will result in 5X higher durability vs. conventional\nmanufacturing.\n"Today, post-build inspection procedures account for as much as 25\npercent of the time required to produce an additively manufactured\nengine component," said Greg Morris, GE Aviation\'s business\ndevelopment leader for additive manufacturing. "By conducting those\ninspection procedures while the component is being built, GE Aviation\nand Sigma labs will expedite production rates for GE\'s additive\nmanufactured engine components like the LEAP fuel nozzle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGE Leap Engine fuel\nnozzle.
