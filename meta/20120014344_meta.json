The Crew and Thermal Systems Division (CTSD) at the NASA Johnson Space Center actively supports these NASA initiatives. In July 2011, CTSD created a strategic communications team to communicate CTSD capabilities, technologies, and personnel to internal NASA and external technical audiences for business development and collaborative initiatives, and to students, educators, and the general public for education and public outreach efforts. This paper summarizes the CTSD Strategic Communications efforts and metrics through the first nine months of fiscal year 2012.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120014344, "endDate": "2012-09-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "1ffca327b6cd4b2ca758606a1f9a4ca6", "id": "aa254f6199d843d1812f996749aaeec0"}], "name": "AIAA Space", "location": "Pasadena, CA", "id": "1ffca327b6cd4b2ca758606a1f9a4ca6", "startDate": "2012-09-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120014344, "id": "2c05094bb6cc478a85fac188a1798eed", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120014344.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120014344/downloads/20120014344.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120014344/downloads/20120014344.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120014344/downloads/20120014344.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
