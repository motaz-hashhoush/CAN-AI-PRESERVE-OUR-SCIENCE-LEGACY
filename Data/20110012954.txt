b"multiplexing, it would be necessary to\nradically redesign the ROIC, at considerably greater development cost.) Other\nadvantages of the external-control approach over the internal-control approach are greater \xef\xac\x82exibility and the\npossibility of using a technique, known\nas \xe2\x80\x9cskimming,\xe2\x80\x9d for subtracting unwanted\ndark-, background-, and noise-current\ncontributions from readout signals\nThe \xef\xac\x81gure schematically depicts the\ncircuitry in one pixel according to an internally controlled multiplexing scheme\nand according to the proposed externally controlled multiplexing scheme.\nIn both schemes, the time multiplexing\nwould be accomplished by switching\n\n(clocking or ramping) the biases applied to the QWIPs via detector common planes. In the internal-control case,\na bias signal would be applied via a single detector common plane and two internal electronic switches. In the proposed external-control case, bias signals\nwould be applied via two detector common planes, without internal electronic\nswitches. A previously unmentioned advantage of the external-control scheme\nshown in the \xef\xac\x81gure is the need for only\none indium bump (instead of two) in\neach pixel.\nThis work was done by Sir B.

There are numerous potential uses for MMICs like\nthese in scientific instruments, radar\nsystems, communication systems, and\ntest equipment operating in this frequency range.\nThis amplifier can be characterized,\nin part, as a lower-frequency, narrowerband, higher-gain version of the one\ndescribed in \xe2\x80\x9cPower Amplifier With 9 to\n13 dB of Gain from 65 to 146 GHz\xe2\x80\x9d\n(NPO-20880), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 25,\nNo. 1 (January 2001), page 44. This amplifier includes four InP high-electronmobility transistors (HEMTs), each having a gate periphery of 148 \xc2\xb5m. In the\nthird amplifier stage, two of the HEMTs\nare combined in parallel to maximize\nthe output power.

As shown in the \xef\xac\x81gure, the ampli\xef\xac\x81er put out a power between 40 and 50 mW over the frequency\n\nrange of 75 to 110 GHz, which is the entire frequency band of the WR-10 waveguide.
