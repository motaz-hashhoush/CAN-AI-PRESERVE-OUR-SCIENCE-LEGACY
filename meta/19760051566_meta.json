Past and present efforts in angiocardiography technology and methodology are reviewed, with special emphasis on qualitative and quantitative measurements of heart and vessel geometry. One of the more recent applications of angiographic image analysis has been for pattern recognition of margin motions over a cardiac cycle, termed contourography. Angiocardiography will continue to serve, as it has served in the past, as the principal standard of reference for calibration and/or comparison of newer methods for determining volume or dimensional change, depending on further technologic advances in X-ray equipment and means for displaying computer-processed information.", "title": "Angiocardiography - Past and present", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T15:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19760051566, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sandler, H."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Biomedical Research Div., Moffett Field, Calif., United States"}}, "id": "4ac2142a15c8456f89403aa37f7d606e"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19760051566, "endDate": "1975-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Stanford Univ. and NASA"}}, "meetingId": "1f3067c20c8640168202e80509200375", "id": "92117668ea034c0a8679cc1ff22dddbb"}], "name": "Conference on Cardiovascular Imaging and Image Processing: Theory and Practice - 1975", "location": "Stanford, CA", "id": "1f3067c20c8640168202e80509200375", "startDate": "1975-07-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19760051566, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760051566, "id": "59ed58c31ba2430daceccf044a6c41fc", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
