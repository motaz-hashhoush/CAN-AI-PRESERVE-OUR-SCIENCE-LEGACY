Here we consider some of those issues in more detail and provide\nparametric studies for some of the antenna concepts to help the system designer in making\nthe most appropriate antenna choice with regards to weight, size, complexity, etc.\nThe question of appropriate polarization for the spacecraft as well as for the User\nTerminal antenna required particular attention and was studied in some depth. Circular\npolarization seems to be the favored outcome of this study.\nAnother problem that has been generally a complicating factor in designing the\nmultiple beam reflector antennas, is the type of feeds (single vs. multiple element and\noverlapping vs. non-overlapping clusters) needed for generating the beams. This choice is\ndependent on certain system design factors, such as the required frequency reuse, acceptable\ninterbeam isolation, antenna efficiency, number of beams scanned, and beam-forming\nnetwork (BFN) complexity. This issue is partially addressed, but is not completely resolved.\nIndications are that it may be possible to use relatively simple non-overlapping clusters of\nonly a few elements, unless a large frequency reuse and very stringent isolation levels are\nrequired.\n6.1\n\nPARAMETRIC STUDIES: NUMBER OF BEAMS, GAIN, SIZE, AND WEIGHT\n\nFor the coverage of the Contiguous United States (CONUS) a closed form relation\nwas derived that relates the number of beams, N, to the half-power beamwidth of the\nmultiple beam antenna, BW, in degrees. It is given as\n*\'..\n\nN = 17.5/BW 2\n\nThis equation is based on the solid angle of the coverage region as seen from the\nsatellite and is valid as long as the satellite is in the geostationary orbit at approximately 90\nto 100 degrees West Longitude. This relation is graphically presented in Figure 1. Several\nspecific coverage cases were considered and the actual number of beams is also presented\nin the figure. As can be seen the agreement is quite good, especially for smaller beamwidths.\n\n6-1\n\nD-7382\nThe actual number of required beams starts to increase for larger beamwidths, since\nin this case it is hard to match the beam footprints to the contour of the boundary and the\narea covered by beams becomes larger than the required coverage region. Since\nBW \xc2\xab 70 / (DA),\n\nwe can also write\nN \xc2\xbb (d/A)2 / 280\nFigure 1 also provides the required antenna aperture diameters for the 20 and 30\nGHz frequencies corresponding to the various beamwidths.\nAs for the weight of the antenna system, we concern ourselves only with a reflector\nantenna system. A full aperture array system is in general too heavy and complex to be\nconsidered for this type of application. The weight of the reflector and the support structure\ndepends on the actual implementation and will be discussed in Chapter 7. Here we confine\nourselves to the study of the feed array weight for the reflector system. A fixed multiple\nbeam antenna is assumed.\nThe feed array dimensions depend, in general, mainly on\ni)\nii)\n\nthe angular dimensions of the coverage region, and\nthe focal length of the reflector system.\n\nThe feed array dimensions are practically independent of\ni)\nii)\n\nthe frequency or wavelength of the operation, and\nthe number of beams over the coverage region.\n\nOf course, since the focal length is typically of the order of the reflector diameter and\nshould be larger for a larger number of beams, the size of the array becomes indirectly\ndependent on the reflector dimension, the number of beams and the frequency. A more\ncomplete discussion of these issues can be found in Reference [2]. These observations are\nused in deriving the following formulas for the feed array weight.\nThe array weight, W, is given by\nW = S Wn + N WTO\n\nin which S is the surface area of the array feed given by\nS = {(l/b)(F/D)[l+(hc/4F)2]}2 D2 n\n\n6-2\n\nD-7382\nF is the focal length, D is the reflector diameter, b is the beam deviation factor and\napproximately equal to or less than unity, hc is the offset of the reflector center from the\nmain axis (zero for a symmetric configuration), and n is the solid angle of the coverage\nregion given approximately by\nn x 0.006 Steradian.\nThen for b=0.9 and F/D = 1.5, S is approximated as\nS * D2/60\nN is the total number of beams, Wn is the weight per unit of feed area, and WTO is\nthe weight per unit TR module. The latter is based on the assumption that due to the\nconsiderable loss in the beamforming network, the feed corresponding to each beam will\nhave its own TR module which consists of a diplexer, a high power amplifier (HPA) and a\nlow noise amplifier (LNA), if the same antenna is used for both transmit and receive\noperations. The number of the modules could be larger than the number of beams if a more\ncomplex feeding system such as an overlapping cluster concept, in which adjacent beams\nshare in a number of radiating elements, is employed.\nOf course for separate transmit and receive antennas only an HPA or an LNA will\nbe needed, and the corresponding weight, W-J-R, will be reduced.\nFinally, the overall feed weight can be approximated by either\nW \xc2\xbb 4.8 N A.2 Wn + N WTO,\n\nas a function of the number of beams, or\nW * (D2/60) Wn + (1/280)(DA)2 WTO,\nas a function of reflector diameter. Figure 2 presents a graphical representation of this\nrelation for the transmit and receive antennas. In this figure we have assumed, based on\nprior experience and the study of a number of cases, that\nW0 \xc2\xbb 1.5 Kg/m2, WTO * 0.1 Kg.\nNaturally, for specific cases one should make the appropriate changes in the above\nvalues for more accurate results.\n\n6-3\n\nD-7382\n6.2\n\nANTENNA POLARIZATION TRADE-OFF (CIRCULAR VS. LINEAR)\n\nAn important factor in the design of the PASS system is the choice of the\nelectromagnetic field polarization for the antennas. The design of the spacecraft as well as\nof the ground user antennas will be affected by this choice. At Ka-band frequencies Faraday\nrotation in propagation through the atmosphere is not a concern. Therefore, ideally, the\nlinearly polarized antennas should be selected, since this choice simplifies the design of the\nfeeding networks.\nHowever, due to the selection of a multiple beam spacecraft antenna, the linear\npolarization, at different beam footprints on the ground, will present different levels of cross\npolarization. This can be seen clearly in Table 1 which presents the variations in the\npolarization directions from the ideal vertical polarization, at different locations -on the\nground. This table is based on a program which can solve for any general case in which\nspacecraft antenna may have any desired position and orientation and can be directed\ntoward any given point on the ground.\nThe spacecraft feed array can be designed in such a way that the radiating elements\nfor each beam will be polarized differently in order to achieve the best polarization quality\nwithin that beam footprint on the ground. However, if for any reason the spacecraft is\nmoved to a different geostationary position, it is possible that the beam polarizations may\ndeteriorate unacceptably.\nThe movements of the user antenna on the ground may also complicate the situation\nby not matching the polarization presented by the spacecraft antenna.\nThe circularly polarized antennas are more robust, however. They are more forgiving\nof the vagaries of the user antenna movements, and far less sensitive to the relocation of the\nspacecraft antenna to different geostationary positions.\nAppendix I discusses some of these issues in more detail.\n63\n\nFEED DESIGN TRADE-OFF (OVERLAPPING VS. NON-OVERLAPPING)\n\nThe design of the feed and beamforming network for the reflector is perhaps the\nmost challenging aspect of the spacecraft antenna design. This design will affect the overall\nantenna gain loss, the achievable sidelobe levels which have a direct bearing on the\ninterbeam isolation levels needed for a frequency reuse operation, as well as the polarization\nof the antenna. This issue has been studied before and documented in [2]. Appendix II\nprovides some additional insight into the choice of simple or multiple element overlapping\ncluster feed. Overall, it can be said that the choice of the simple non-overlapping feeds is\nmore desirable in most cases.\n\n6-4\n\nD-7382\nThere are, however, instances in which due to the requirements of a very large\nnumber of beams, very low sidelobes, high interbeam isolation, .and very large frequency\nreuse, the introduction of the overlapping cluster design may become necessary. This is\nparticularly true when far scanned beams in a very large multiple beam system will have\nunacceptably high coma lobes which can be cured by the implementation of a multi-element\nfeed array and/or a much larger focal length/reflector diameter ratio, F/D.\nA specific trade-off issue is the choice between a reflector system with a very large\nF/D and hence large feed array and support booms, or a complex and heavy beamforming\nnetwork for the overlapping feed clusters. This issue needs further analysis in the context of\nmore specific requirements of the system.\n6.4\n\nALTERNATIVE DESIGN OPTIONS\n\nIn this section some alternative design issues are considered. One issue relates to the\nselection of the most appropriate optics, namely, the number and type of the reflectors and\nfeed arrays and their configuration. A second issue relates to the multiple beam construction\nand operation and whether they are fixed, switched, or scanned.\nAnd, finally, the issue of beamforming network design in respect to the mechanics of\nthe power distribution is considered and discussed. The beamforming network can be\ndesigned to optimize the efficient use of the power amplifiers under conditions of short or\nlong term variable channels allocation and usage by different beams covering different\ngeographic regions.\n6.4.1 ALTERNATIVE REFLECTOR/FEED TOPOLOGIES\n\nThe last PASS report [1] enumerated some alternative design concepts for the\nreflector system configuration. The simplest design involves the use of a single offset-fed\nreflector with a focal plane feed array for fixed simultaneous multiple beam operation. Some\nnumerical results for this design are presented in the next section. Here we look at two\nalternative concepts.\nA promising system involves the use of a near field array in conjunction with a single\nhyperbolic (as opposed to a typically parabolic) reflector which provides for beam scanning\nby varying only the phase of the component feed elements (Reference [3]). A theoretical\ncomputer study of this concept has been undertaken, but no concrete results have been\nobtained so far. By using a multi-layer beamforming network (BFN) one can achieve a\nmultiple beam system with independently scanned individual beams with only a single\nreflector and feed array. We recommend that this concept be further studied in the future\nsince it may be one of the more attractive advanced concepts in the reflector RF design.\n\n6-5\n\nD-7382\nAnother option considered was mechanical beam scanning by using a small movable\narray in conjunction with a symmetric parabolic reflector or a spherical reflector antenna.\nThe spherical reflector has the advantage that once the excitation values are evaluated for\nthe on-axis beam, the same excitation values can be used for off-axis or scanned beams, due\nto the rotational symmetry of the reflector. The results of the mechanical scanning study are\npresented in Appendix III.\n6.4.2 SCANNING / SWITCHED BEAM VS. FIXED BEAM TRADE-OFF\n\nIn multibeam satellite systems, scanning/switched beam concepts may be used instead\nof fixed simultaneous beams. This can reduce the number of components and the weight\nof the system at the expense of requiring more complex components and beam management\nsystems. The following is a description of the major features of switched or scanned beam\nsystems.\nSwitched Beams:\n1-\n\nThe number of active beams at any given time is fewer than the total number\nof beams needed for the entire coverage region.\n\n2-\n\nThe number of required feed array elements is the same as that needed for\na fixed multiple beam system.\n\n3-\n\n. The number of high power amplifiers (HPA) and low noise amplifiers (LNA)\nis reduced.\n\n4-\n\nTo provide the same number of channels as a fixed multiple beam system,\nusing a time division multiplex system, higher power HP As are required.\n\n5-\n\nThe system requires complex switching networks including PIN diodes and/or\nferrite switches and their driving circuitry.\n\nScanned Beams:\n1-\n\nAs in the switched beam case, simultaneous coverage is not provided for the\nentire coverage region.\n\n2-\n\nCan be used in a single or dual reflector system with a phased array feed (see\nsection 6.4.3).\n\n3-\n\nThe number of required feed array elements, if a single reflector antenna is\nused, is more or less the same as that needed for a fixed beam system.\n\n6-6\n\nD-7382\n4-\n\nThe number of required feed array elements can be substantially reduced if\na dual reflector antenna system is used.\n\n5-\n\nThe number of HPAs and LNAs are reduced.\n\n6-\n\nTo provide the same coverage as a fixed multiple beam system, higher power\nHPAs are required.\n\n7-\n\nThe HPAs and the LNAs may require wider bandwidths.\n\n8-\n\nRequires the use of variable (continuous or multiple-bit digital) phase shifters\nin the beamforming network.\n\n6-7\n\nD-7382\n\n6.4.3 INTERBEAM POWER MANAGEMENT\nMultiple beam systems can increase transmission capacity with an increase of satellite\nantenna gain and reuse of allocated frequency band. However, the implementation of a\nmultiple beam system for contiguous communication requires special considerations to avoid\ninefficient use of satellite power and to ensure reliable operation. For single beam systems,\nall the transponders are connected to a single beam, and every Earth station has access to\nall the transponders. Therefore, traffic variations in a local area are acceptable, provided\nthey do not exceed the total transmission capacity.\nOn the other hand, in the case of multiple beam systems, the area subtended by each\nbeam is only a part of the total service area, and the transmission capacity of each beam is\nalso a fixed portion of the total transmission capacity. Thus, the fixed allocation of\ntransponder capacity to each beam degrades the flexibility of the system under varying traffic\ndistribution.\nIn order to cope with these problems, two adaptive schemes are suggested in this\nsection. One is the multiport Hybrid transponder that can be used for a multibeam antenna\nsystem, where each beam is generated by separate feed array elements. The other is a full\narray beam forming network, where each beam is generated by all the feed array elements.\n(a) Multiport Hybrid Transponder:\nThis system, as originally proposed by Egami et al. [4], consists of multiple hybrids\nand multiple amplifiers and inherently realizes wide-band transmission. Figure 3 shows a 4port Hybrid transponder where each 4-port box depicts an ordinary 90 degree hybrid. When\nall the amplifiers are working properly, the information in each beam ends up in one of the\nantennas only.\nMeanwhile, every beam is amplified by all the amplifiers and, therefore, failure of one\namplifier does not cause the total loss of that beam\'s transmission. Hence, this scheme\nallows for graceful degradation of the multibeam system if one or few of the active elements\nfail. Moreover, since the amplifiers share a common wide frequency band, the number of\ncarriers transmitted from each beam can be changed from 0 to maximum value, limited only\nby the total transmitting power. Therefore, this system provides the adaptability needed for\nthe efficient use of satellite power.\nFigure 4 shows the 4-port Hybrid transponder used with an offset parabolic antenna\nsystem for a simultaneous fixed multibeam transmission. In this configuration, the feed array\nis placed on the focal plane of the reflector and the reflector is in the far field of the feed\narray. The hybrid transponder sends each of the beams to a separate feed array element,\nin the focal plane, and generates the corresponding far field pattern of the reflector.\n\n6-8\n\n7>\n\nD-7382\n\nThe disadvantage of this system, is that it requires many 90 degree hybrids which\nincreases the size of the feed array assembly. However, it does not need complex phase\nshifting components and the associated circuitry.\n(b) Full Feed Array Beam Forming Network:\n\nIn this concept every beam is generated by all the feed array elements. Figure 5\nshows a 4-beam, 4-antenna element system. Each beam is connected to the elements of the\nfeed array via phase shifters. The phase shift provided by each phase shifter is determined\nprecisely to point each beam in a specific direction. The amplifiers share a common\nwideband and each contributes to the amplification of all the beams. Therefore, the failure\nof one amplifier does not cause a total failure of a beam but only a graceful degradation in\nthe system performance. This concept, like the hybrid transponder method, allows adaptive\ncarrier allocation to each beam. The number of carriers in each beam can change from zero\nto the maximum, limited only by the total transmission power.\nFigure 6 shows two reflector antenna configurations that can be used with the full\nfeed array beam forming network. In Figure 6-a, a single hyperbolic reflector is used in the\nnear field of the feed array [3]. With the feed array outside of the reflector focal region, it\nis possible to generate multiple far field beams from the multibeam near field pattern of the\nfeed array.\nFigure 6-b shows a dual parabolic reflector system where the subreflector is located\nin the near field of the phased array. In both systems, by proper positioning of the array\nsuch that the center of the main reflector and the array are conjugate points, an optimum\ndesign can be achieved such that among other things, the reflector surface deformations can\nbe compensated solely by the phase adjustment of the array elements [5].\nThis system does not require the large number of hybrids which are needed for the\nhybrid transponder. However, it requires a large number of phase shifters which are\nrelatively complex, lossy and costly.\n\n6-9\n\nD-7382\n\n6.5\n\nDESIGN DATA FOR SELECTED ANTENNA SIZES\n\nFor PASS, two separate multibeam satellite antennas are used for receive and\ntransmit to alleviate the potential problem of passive intermodulation (PIM). In order to\nprovide the required antenna gain of over 52 dBi, antenna diameters of the order of 2 to\n4 meters at the uplink (receive, frequency of 30 GHz) and 3 to 6 meters at the downlink\n(transmit, frequency of 20 GHz) are considered.\nThese antennas produce beams with 3-dB beamwidth of approximately 0.35 degrees\nfor the 2/3 meter system and 0.175 degrees for the 4/6 meter system. Therefore, to cover the\nCONUS it is necessary to scan the feeds in these antennas by either 10 or 20 beamwidths\nfor the 2/3 or 4/6 meter systems, respectively, as shown in Figures 7 and 8 (reproduced from\n[1]). Scanning the beam off axis will cause performance degradations which include loss of\ngain and higher sidelobe levels. However, the severity of these degradations is a function of\nthe reflector geometry and the feed illumination of the reflector.\nIn this section a parametric study is performed to evaluate the effect of the satellite\nantenna F/D and the feed edge taper (ET) on the antenna gain and pattern as the feed is\nscanned. The geometry of the antenna and the location of the feed are shown in Figure 9.\nIn this study two antenna sizes (2 or 4 meters in diameter) are considered at 30 GHz. For\nthe 3 and 6 meter antennas at 20 GHz, the same results will apply since their electrical\ndimensions (i.e., in terms of the wavelength) are the same, respectively.\nTo cover the entire CONUS, the feed has to be scanned in both x and y directions\nas shown in Figures 7, 8, and 9. However, the required scan in the y direction (here\nassumed to be the East-West direction) is much larger and causes a more severe pattern\ndegradation than in the x direction. Therefore, only the results for the feed scanned in the\ny-direction are presented here.\nThe results reported here are generated using a reflector antenna computer program\nbased on the application of the physical optics integration which is evaluated by the JacobiBessel expansion technique [6]. This computer program generates the far field pattern of\nreflector antennas, with given geometrical dimensions, based on the location and pattern of\ntheir feeds.\nTable 2 shows the on and off axis gain and efficiency of the 2-meter antenna, as a\nfunction of the reflector (F/D) and the feed edge taper, when its feed is scanned .in the y\ndirection by 10 beamwidths (the maximum scan in the East-West direction as shown in\nFigure 7).\nTable 3 shows the same parameters for the 4-meter antenna when its feed is scanned\nin the y direction by 20 beamwidths (the maximum scan in the East-West direction as shown\nin Figure 8).\n\n6-10\n\nD-7382\nAs expected, in general, larger F/D (or F, since D is fixed) and higher ET values\nimprove the off-axis gain and efficiency of the reflector, and reduce the sidelobe degradation.\nHowever, the larger the F is, the longer and heavier are the supporting booms and the\nlarger is the size of the feed array (see Section 6.1 and References [2] and [7]). Moreover,\nthe values of the ET larger than about -5 dB require overlapping cluster feeds instead of\nsimple feeds.\nOverlapping cluster feeds require much more complex beam forming networks (BFN)\nand are also heavier. Therefore, it is important to keep the ET under -5 dB and the focal\nlength as small as possible.\nFigures 10 through 17 show the far field patterns of the 2- and the 4-meter antennas\nwhen their feeds are either on focal point or scanned by 10 or 20 beamwidths, respectively.\nAll the patterns are normalized to the on-focus beam maximum and are plotted about their\nmaximum without making corrections for the beam deviation factor. With these figures, the\ndegree of pattern degradation and gain loss can be compared for different values of F/D and\nET.\nBy analyzing the data shown in Tables 2 and 3 the following can be concluded:\nFor the 4-meter antenna, the supporting boom for the feed has to be very long to avoid high\ngain loss and poor efficiency. An F/D of 2 requires a focal length of 8 meters for the 4-meter\nantenna and 12 meters for the 6-meter antenna, focal lengths which are prohibitively large.\nFor an F/D of 1.5, it is necessary to have an ET = -15 dB or higher, which still requires long\nfeed support structures as well as a very complicated BFN.\nFor the 2-meter antenna, an F/D of 1.5 can be used with an ET=-5 dB to obtain\nacceptably low gain loss, moderate size for the feed supporting structure, and a simple BFN.\nFor higher ET values, low gain loss and high efficiency can be achieved at the expense of\nrequiring a more complex BFN.\n6.6\n\nCRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES AND DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n\nThe major challenging technologies for the PASS satellite antennas are described\nbelow.\n(1) Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC)\n\nThe large feed arrays needed for the satellite antennas require very complex\nelectronic circuits. These circuits must be low loss, low weight, and compact in size.\nMMIC manufacturing technology is a key to implementing such circuits and,\ntherefore, must be developed for use in this system.\n\n6-11\n\nD-7382\n(2) Overlapping Cluster Feeds\nOverlapping cluster feeds are needed to generate closely packed (high cross-over)\nmultiple fixed beams with low sidelobes. This requires developing either MMIC or\nRF/Optical/RF beamforming networks for the 20/30 GHz region.\n(3) Low Loss Phase-Shifters and Power Dividers/Combiners\nIn order to generate time scanned beams, the feed array beam forming network\nrequires phase shifters and power dividers/combiners. At 20/30 GHz frequencies, low\nloss phase shifters and power dividers/combiners present a formidable challenge and\nneed to be developed using MMIC technology to achieve efficient beam scanning.\n(4) Low Loss Switching Networks\nIn order to generate switching beams, the feed array beam forming network requires\nswitching circuits to activate a desired group of radiating elements for each specific\nbeam. Low loss switching networks for 20/30 GHz frequencies are very complex and\nchallenging to develop.\n(5) Time-Delay Beam Forming Networks\nIn order to generate scanning beams across the coverage area using the frequency\nscan approach, true time delay elements (such as filters), in which the phase changes\nlinearly as a function of the frequency, are needed. Development of beam forming\nnetworks employing these components is a challenging task.\n(6) Adaptive Reflector Distortion Compensation\nTo compensate the effect of the time varying thermal and dynamic distortion on the\nreflector system in space, adaptive feed arrays can be used. Techniques for\ncompensation of these distortions, by real time change of the array elements phase\nand amplitude, should be investigated and evaluated for technical feasibility and cost.\n(7) Efficient Feed Array Elements\nLow loss, wideband, and efficient array elements, capable of providing large scan\nangles, are needed to avoid overall antenna performance degradation. New concepts\nin array element technology such as scanning or stacked elements should be\ninvestigated and their feasibility studied.\n\n6-12\n\nD-7382\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1]\n\nM. K.

Polarization Options for the PASS System\n(P. Cramer)\n\nAn open issue for the PASS program is the choice of polarization, linear\nvs. circular. Linear polarization is the simplest to Implement both on\nthe satellite and in the ground terminal and therefore would be the\npreferred polarization type if it has no performance limitations. The\nprimary limitation would be if the angle (polarization angle) between the\neffective polarization vectors of the satellite and ground user terminal\nantennas wrrere of a sufficient magnitude such that the polarization loss\nexceeded an acceptable level. If the polarization loss Is unacceptable,\nthen circular polarization would be required since circular polarization\ndoes not suffer a loss associated with a polarization angle.\nTo resolve this issue, the polarization angle for linear polarization was\ncalculated for typical satellite/ground user terminal geometries. The\nfollowing definition is used to define the polarization angle. See Figure\n1. Two planes, both containing the line of sight between the satellite\nantenna and the ground user antenna, will be defined with the angle\nbetween the two planes, being the polarization angle. The first plane\nwill be defined by the line of sight and the polarization vector of the\nground user antenna (such as the local vertical for vertical\npolarization). The user terminal effective polarization vector Is In this\nplane and at a right angle to the line of sight. The second plane will\nbe defined by the line of sight vector and the satellite antenna\npolarization vector (such as vertical polarization). Again the satellite\nantenna effective polarization vector is in the second plane and at a\nright angle to the line of sight. The angle then between the effective\npolarization vectors and hence the two planes defines the polarization\nangle.\nThis definition was selected to eliminate the possibility of\nIncluding pattern directivity effects in the computation of the\npolarization angle. The polarization power loss would then be equal to\nthe square of the cosine of the polarization angle.\n\n6-33\n\n0-7382\n\nThe assumptions were mad* that the satellite is in a geo-synchronous\norbit midway across the continental US (95.0 w longitude) and has the\nantenna boreslghted approximately at the middle of CON US so that\nCONUS type pattern coverage could be provided. The polarization angle\nwas then calculated for user ground terminals located around the\nperiphery of the country as this should Identify the worst cases. The\npolarization angles were computed for both vertical and horizontal\npolarization where the polarization of the user terminal antenna is\ndefined to be either along or normal to the local vertical. Table 1\nsummarizes the geometry and In the last column, lists the polarization\nangles associated with each location. The worst cases are along the\nwestern and eastern coastlines with the angles getting larger towards\nthe south. With angles ranging from 22 to 30 degrees, this represents\npolarization losses of from 0.7 to 1.3 dB. However since the ground\nuser terminals must include hand held devices that can not be oriented\naccurately, the effect of orientation errors must be included in the\npolarization angle determination.\nNo attempt was made to accurately\ndefine what the extent of the orientation errors would be In typical\nusage, however to get a feel for the effect of such errors, it was\nassumed that realistic errors would be between 25 to 30 degrees. 27\ndegrees was specifically selected since this represents a loss of 1.0 dB.\nAdding this orientation angular error in the worst case direction to the\npolarization angles in Table 1 gives polarization losses from 3.7 to 5.3\ndB. If the orientation errors are any larger, the losses are going to\nIncrease rapidly since the cosine of an angle changes rapidly for angles\nlarger than 50 degrees.\nTables 2 and 3 show cases where the satellite is located towards the\nwestern and eastern ends of the country to determine the effect of the\nsatellite location on polarization angle. As can be seen the worst case\npolarization angles are approximately 45 degrees.\nOrientation errors\nwould have to be held within 12 degrees if losses similar to the\ncentrally located satellite case are to be obtained. However, while the\npolarization error increased along one coastline, it Improved along the\nopposite coastline.\nIf the satellite antenna is adjusted about its\nboresight axis, it is possible to balance the polarization angles between\neach coast and the losses should be comparable to the case for the\n\n6-34\n\nD-7382\ncentrally located satellite. However, It might not always be possible to\nadjust the satellite antenna to minimize the polarization angle If\nredundant or multiple satellites are used in different locations and there\nIs a need to be able to move the satellites to any of these assigned\norbit location.\nThe possibility exists that the polarization orientation of each feed\nelement in the satellite antenna feed array could be adjusted to match\nthe user terminal polarization at the beam direction associated with that\nfeed element. This would eliminate the satellite to user local vertical\npolarization loss. However, It still does not eliminate the user terminal\norientation errors as the 27 degree error equates to a 1.0 dB loss. This\nsolution still has the limitation as to the range In satellite locations that\ncould be supported since It Is not feasible to custom design the satellite\nantenna for each satellite location.\nIf circular polarization Is used, there could be as much as 0.4 dB in\nincreased losses for the user terminal. For a typical patch antenna\ndesign, an additional power splitter would be required to generate\ncircular polarization and the additional mlcrostrlp circuitry could cut\ndown on the efficiency of the required dual frequency design. The\nsatellite antenna system is to have separate antennas for each frequency\nand since costs are not as critical for a satellite antenna, it Is\nconceivable that a lower loss solution should be attainable to produce\ncircular polarization, with a loss lower than 0.2 dB.\nIt is my recommendation that circular polarization be used for the PASS\nprogram for the following reasons: Since handheld terminals must be\nsupported by the PASS program, it Is not reasonable to expect the\naverage user to be able to control the orientation of their terminal any\nbetter than 27 degrees. Assuming that the satellite to user terminal\nlocal vertical optimization is used then, polarization losses on the order\nof 1.0 dB or more can still be expected assuming a terminal orientation\nerror of 27 or more degrees.\nEven with the circular polarization\nimplementation losses on the order of 0.5 dB, 0.5 dB or more\nimprovement could be obtained with circular polarization. Secondly, if it\nis not feasible for what ever reason to optimize the satellite antenna\n\n6-35\n\nD-7382\n\ndesign, then losses as high as 5.0 dB would result, considerably higher\nthan the circular polarization implementation losses. Thirdly It does not\nseem practical to give up the mission flexibility of being able to locate a\ngiven satellite or satellite design in more than one orbit location simply\nto utilize linear polarization. Commercial satellites In the past have had\nto live with the fact that In many cases It was not know what their\nspecific orbit location assignments would be until close to launch time.\nThere is no reason to expect that this problem will change in the\nfuture. The main argument used in favor of linear polarization is cost\nand possibly weight.\nHowever, with the continual development of\nintegrated and etched antenna circuits and technology, and considering\nthe time frame in which the PASS system would be widely used, there\nshould be very little difference In cost and weight between the two\npolarization types. The differences in cost will show up primarily as\ndevelopment costs and should be able to be amortized over a large user\nbase and It Is part of the technology development activity to make this\nhappen. And lastly, circular polarization leaves open the possibility to\ntake advantage of new antenna concepts or system requirements that\nmight be developed In the future that would not be compatible with\nlinear polarization.\n\n6-36\n\n6-37\n\nD-7382\n\n1 \xc2\xa3\n\nD-7332\nTable 1\n\nSATELLITE/GROUND STATION GEOMETRY\nDATE: 11-02-88.\nSATELLITE DESCRIPTION:\nLATITUDE =\n.000 DEG\nLONGITUDE = -95.000 DEG\nANTENNA 30R&SITE LOCATION:\nLATITUDE =\n3G .000 DEG\nLONGITUDE =\n-95 .000 DEG\nGROUND TERMINAL LOCATION\n\nTIME: J3 : :5 : 1J . ui ?M\n\nALTITUDE\n= 35838.052 KM\nEARTH RADIUS = 6378.160 KM\n\nALTITUDE =\n\nIN EARTH COORD.\n\np tuftp\nKAflub\n\n.000 KM\n\nELEVATION =\nAZIMUTH\n=\n\nIN ANTENNA COORD SATELLITE\ntinOUA!\xe2\x80\xa2/ IlLUt*\nHwttnA f /TT T HP\n\nr npiTT f\\*Z\nLUCA1 iuii\n\n5. 777 DE-.\n\n.000 DE:\n\nPOLARI:.;TI:\n* Vf*T C"\nVERT/HOB: :\n\nPOLAR\n\nAZIMUTH\n\nELEV/AZ\n\n38733.406\n\n3.165\n88.785\n\n67.422\n87.077\n\n29.227\n145.013\n\n22.630\ni:2.i08\n\n.000\n\n38013.671\n\n3.504\n89.867\n\n87.822\n86.499\n\n37.693\n139.742\n\n30.544\n30.i3G\n\n34.058\n-118.250\n\n.000\n\n37589.490\n\n3.197\n90.315\n\n95.663\n86.819\n\n43.252\n142.506\n\n30.114\n30.131\n\nSan Diego.

Cramer\nOne of the issues that needs to be resolved for the PASS Program\nsatellite antenna design is whether or not overlapping apertures\nare required. The purpose of this memorandum is to address some of\nthe issues so that a decision can be made.\nA single non-overlapping feed aperture is the simplest design since\na beam forming network is not required. This is reflected in a\nlower cost design with lower losses. However, for a design based\non a crossover level of 3 dB between adjacent beams, the\nnon-overlapping aperture has a higher illumination efficiency\nbecause the feed aperture size available causes the main reflector\nto be over-illuminated. The negative side of over-illuminating is\na low spillover efficiency and a low crossover level between\nadjacent beams because of narrow beamwidths.\nOverlapping aperture designs are not limited by the space available\nbetween the feed centers in the reflector focal plane. If the feed\nelements for one beam are allowed to overlap the feed elements for\nan adjacent beam, then the feed can be made as large as necessary\nto optimize the reflector illumination. Typically, the spillover\nefficiency will improve, but the illumination efficiency will drop\nas a result of larger edge tapers. The larger edge tapers however,\nproduce lower side lobe levels and therefore the overlapping design\nis best for frequency reuse applications where high isolation is\nneeded. In addition, the broader beamwidths associated with the\nlower illumination efficiencies produce higher crossover level\nbetween adjacent beams.\nOverlapping aperture designs require\nelaborate beam forming networks that are costly and introduce\ndissipative losses.\nFor the PASS program, in order to make the proper choice, the\nconstraints must be identified.\nFrequency reuse is not a\nrequirement.\nTherefore the high isolation of the overlapping\ndesign is not needed. However performance is a critical factor.\nThe PASS concept design indicates that the basic personal terminal\nmust have a gain of 22.8 dB at 30 GHz and provide an output power\nof 0.3 watt.\nHowever it turns out that these performance\nrequirements are not compatible with the requirement that the\nterminal design not violate RF radiation safety standards [1].\nFrom Figure 7 of reference [I], it turns out that a gain of about\n29 dB and a power of only 0.072 watts are needed to reduce the\nradiated power density to a safe level and still provide the\nrequired EIRP. To market an user terminal with 29 dB gain would be\nprohibitively expensive.\nIn any design, the cost of a ground\nterminal must be kept low to attract users and to achieve this,\nsystem complexity should be shifted to the satellite. Even at an\nincrease cost to the satellite, the overall program costs normally\nwould be lower.\nTo reduce the user terminal gain, the user\nterminal EIRP must be reduced and the satellite performance\n\n6-41\n\nD-7382\nincreased accordingly. To satisfy the higher satellite performance\nrequirements, cost of the satellite antenna system is no longer the\nprime driver. Increasing the satellite antenna size to increase\nthe gain to noise temperature ratio to compensate for the loss of\nEIRP from the user terminal is not attractive from a cost\nstandpoint until the antenna efficiency has been maximized. Thus\nthe choice between an overlapping feed design and a non-overlapping\ndesign should be made based on performance and to a much lesser\ndegree on costs.\nTo compare the two feed concepts, the antenna configuration\npresented in the trade-off section of the "Second-Generation Mobile\nSatellite System" study [2] was used. From part two, section 2.7,\nthe single element cluster with four patches per element is used as\na typical example of a non-overlapping feed.\nThe six element\ncluster with two patches per element is used as a good example of\nan overlapping feed.\nIn all cases, the same patch size and\nspacings were used.\nFrom the study report, the single element\ncluster had a peak gain (or efficiency) 0.18 dB higher than the six\nelement cluster. To gain more insight into the relative merits of\nthe two configurations, the patterns of the two configurations were\nanalyzed using the pattern efficiency program. The results are\nsummarized in Table 1 and are identified as the "nominal" cases in\nthe table.\nEqual excitations were used for all element and\npatches. The difference in efficiency for the two configurations\nwith the base line F/D of 1.08 is 0.09 dB in favor of the single\nelement cluster. The efficiency program is based on symmetrical\nreflector designs, while the cases analyzed in the system study are\nfor offset designs. Since the two approaches give differences in\nefficiencies which are within 0.09 dB of each other (0.18 - 0.09),\nthe efficiency program is still useful in performing trade-offs\nbetween various offset designs and provides additional insights\nsince efficiency contributors such as spillover, illumination,\nphase, cross-polarization, etc are individually identified. Due to\nthe broader secondary pattern of the six element cluster, the six\nelement cluster had an adjacent beam cross-over level of\napproximately 1.1 dB higher than for the single element cluster.\nThis gives the six element cluster a net improvement of 1.0 dB over\nthe single element cluster.\nTable 1 also shows the F/D at which each configuration has the\nhighest efficiency. These cases are identified as the "maximum"\ncases in Table 1. The results imply that if no changes are made in\nthe feed design and reflector diameter, the antenna would have it\'s\nbest performance if it had the F/D indicated. The single element\ncluster would require a F/D of 0.81 which is not attractive since\nit would have a degraded outer beam performance and a smaller area\navailable for the feed in the focal plane.\nHowever, the six\nelement cluster\'s best F/D is 1.38. If the feed separation that is\nused for the F/D of 1.08 design is also used for a F/D of 1.38\ncase, then the adjacent beams would move closer together by about\n22 percent.\nUsing equation 2-2 from the study report, the\ncrossover level between adjacent beams for the six element cluster\nwith a F/D of 1.38 would be 1.14 dB higher than for the single\nelement cluster with a F/D of 1.08. This comparison is reasonable\n\n6-42\n\n0-7382\nsince the illumination efficiency of the two cases are close,\nimplying similarly shaped secondary patterns.\nAdding the gain\nimprovement associated with the higher efficiency of the six\nelement cluster at a F/D of 1.38 with the efficiency of the single\nelement cluster at a F/D of 1.08 (0.42 dB) gives an overall\nimprovement for the six element cluster of about 1.56 dB. More\naccurate comparisons should be made by calculating the secondary\npattern for the larger F/D case, this type of calculation being\nbeyond the scope of this review.\nHowever the size of the\nimprovements (approximately 1.0 dB for F/D of 1.08 and 1.6 dB for\nF/D of 1.38) indicate that the six element cluster represents a\nworth while improvement over the single element cluster.\nThe example above indicates that an overlapping aperture design can\nprovide a significant improvement over a non-overlapping design if\nit is assumed that there are no network losses associated with the\noverlapping design.\nOtherwise a considerable part of the\nimprovement could be lost to dissipative losses, perhaps\napproaching a wash between the two concepts. If this is the case\nthen a non-overlapping design would be preferable because of\nsimplicity and cost. To make the overlapping design viable, then\na method to reduce or eliminate the network losses is required. It\nis suggested that a low noise preamplifier and a power amplifier\nstage with diplexer could be placed between the feed elements and\nthe beam forming network to eliminate this loss.\nThe recommendation for the PASS program then, is to use overlapping\nfeed apertures to obtain higher antenna performance and to locate\npreamplifiers and power amplifiers behind the feed elements to\neliminate the associated network losses.\nThis also opens the\npossibility of exploring the implementation of the beam forming\nnetwork at IF frequencies to see if improved performance, packaging\nsize and weight might be found. The enabling technology that would\nneed to be developed would include:\n1) low loss linear power\namplifier, pre-amplifier and diplexer modules, 2) fabrication\nmethods to make them cheaply and compactly, 3) efficient methods to\nmount and interconnect each module, and 4) methods to integrate the\nmodules with the feed elements.\nReferences:\n[1] Memorandum from P.

Rahmat-Samii)\nThe main objective of this work is to present some new design options for the PASS\nhigh gain spacecraft antenna configurations. Usually, most of the studies are focussed on the\napplication of offset parabolic and Cassegrain reflector antennas with large focal lengths\n(large F/D ratios). See, e.g., Section 6.5, and also Reference [1] for a detailed investigation.\nOne of the key parameters in achieving the design requirements is to generate beams with\nmany beamwidths scan performance. As discussed in section 6, for a complete CONUS\ncoverage the antenna must generate beams with scan capabilities of up to 3.5 degrees off\nboresight. For example, for a 4.0 meter antenna operating at 30 GHz, over \xc2\xb1 20 BW scan\nangle is required.\nThe concepts studied here involve the use of a small movable array to produce an\noptimized beam. Both symmetric parabolic and spherical reflector antennas are considered.\nAttention is given to the nature of the excitation coefficients for both on-axis beams and offaxis beams in the 3.5\xc2\xb0 scan direction.\nThe geometry of a symmetric parabolic antenna is shown in Figure 1. For this\nconfiguration, the antenna performance, using a single feed element as well as a small feed\narray is studied. Results are summarized in Table 1. Note that the off-axis beams are\ngenerated by moving either the single element feed or the small array feed to a proper\nlocation in the focal plane of the reflector. Both 7-element and 19-element feed arrays are\nconsidered. In order to improve the improve the off-axis performance, the excitation\ncoefficients of the array elements were optimized using the technique presented in [2].\nA similar investigation has been performed using a spherical reflector antenna. The\ngeometry of the reflector is shown in Figure 2. It should be noticed that the effective focal\npoint for this reflector is approximately midway between the center of the sphere and the\napex point of the reflector. Results of the computer simulation are shown in Table 1. It must\nbe noted that due to the spherical aberration, the single feed configuration does not lend\nitself to satisfactory results. However, as shown in Table 1, the 19-element array feed does\nimprove the performance considerably. An advantage of using the aberration-corrected\nspherical reflector is that the same array can be used for the scanned beams. This is due to\nthe rotational symmetry of the spherical reflector. Note that the feed array is positioned in\na location with 3.5\xc2\xb0 tilt angle with respect to the original axis.\nStudies need to be conducted for the use of large arrays off the focal plane of the\noffset parabolic, hyperbolic or other types of reflectors. The purpose of such investigations\nwill be to demonstrate the potential applicability of simple single-reflector electronic beam\nsteering.\nThe above options should provide new design considerations for the reflector array\nconfigurations.
