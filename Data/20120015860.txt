Recently, terahertz (THz) technology (300-3000 GHz\nfrequency) has attracted a great deal of interest from academia and industry. This is due to a\nnumber of interesting features of THz waves, including the nearly unlimited bandwidths\navailable, and the non-ionizing radiation nature which does not damage human tissues and\nDNA with minimum health threat. Also, as millimeter-wave communication systems mature,\nthe focus of research is, naturally, moving to the THz range.\nMany scientists regard THz as the last great frontier of the electromagnetic spectrum, but\nfinding new applications outside the traditional niches of radio astronomy, Earth and planetary\nremote sensing, and molecular spectroscopy\xe2\x80\x94particularly in biomedical imaging and wireless\ncommunications \xe2\x80\x94 has been relatively slow. Radiologists find this area of study so attractive\nbecause t-rays are non-ionizing, which suggests no harm is done to tissue or DNA. They also\noffer the possibility of performing spectroscopic measurements over a very wide frequency\nrange, and can even capture signatures from liquids and solids.\nAccording to Shannon theory, the broad bandwidth of the THz frequency bands can be used\nfor terabit-per-second (Tb/s) wireless communication systems. This enables several new\napplications, such as cell phones with 360\xc2\xb0 autostereoscopic displays, optic-fiber replacement,\nand wireless Tb/s file transferring. Although THz technology could satisfy the demand for an\nextremely high data rate, a number of technical challenges need to be overcome before its\ndevelopment. This presentation provides an overview the state-of-the- art in THz wireless\ncommunication and the technical challenges for an emerging application in Terabit wireless\nsystems. The main issue for THz wave propagation is the high atmospheric attenuation, which\nis dominated by water vapor absorption in the THz frequency band. The technical challenges in\ndesign such a system and the techniques to overcome the challenges will be discussed in this\npresentation.\n\n'
