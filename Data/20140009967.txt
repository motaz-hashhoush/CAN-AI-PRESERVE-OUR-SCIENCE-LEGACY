To form a tight seal, the valve spring compresses the valve\xe2\x80\x99s O-ring between two planar mating surfaces.\nBoth the valve seat and the sealing surface of the valve head\nare oriented substantially perpendicular to the valve axis. A\npressure differential increases the extent of compression\nbetween the resilient valve seal and both sealing surfaces.\nThe resilient valve seal is an annular O-ring that deforms to\na predetermined extent into sealing engagement against both\nsealing surfaces. When the pressure of a fluid within the vessel exceeds the desired spring biasing force, the valve face lifts\nfrom the valve seat to relieve pressure within the vessel.\nApplications include lab glassware and gloveboxes, or vacuum\ncommercial operations where the content environment must\nbe rigorously controlled.\nGet the complete report on this technology at:\nwww.techbriefs.com/tow/201406a.html\nEmail: nasatech@yet2.com\nPhone: 781-972-0600\n\nA novel technology investigates reservoir beds of oil, gas,\nfreshwater, and thermal water deposits. The system, which\nuses electromagnetic frequency broadband sounding, gathers\ninformation to a depth of up to 7,000 meters. For effective\noperation on deposits, the technology draws up scientifically\nsubstantiated references for the allocation of injection wells.\nThe sounding system discloses and identifies mineral types;\nnonconventional hydrocarbons/shales; and dynamic changes,\nincluding the process of mass movement. Using a helicopter\nor small airplane, deposits in swamps, mountains, and other\nhard-to-reach places can be explored, and a system information model can be constructed. The method is ecologically\nsafe, and searches are achieved in abnormal operation conditions, including crystalline shield, salt beds and pillars.\nGet the complete report on this technology at:\nwww.techbriefs.com/tow/201406b.html\nEmail: nasatech@yet2.com\nPhone: 781-972-0600\n\nTechNeeds \xe2\x80\x94 Requests for Technologies\nTechNeeds are anonymous requests for technologies that you and your organization may be able to fulfill.

The current application\nuses polyurethane foams that range from millimeters to 2\ncm thick. The foams offer little or no ventilation in a situation where air circulation can be critical. New materials at\nthe fiber level must be used to create a light fabric with a\nbuild-in structural thickness and loft. Possible solution areas\ninclude mathematical models of knitting matrices and nonwoven manufacturing techniques.\nRespond to this TechNeed at:\nwww.techbriefs.com/tn/201406c.html\nEmail: nasatech@yet2.com\nPhone: 781-972-0600\n\nA client seeks a device capable of detecting contamination\nin a liquid flow. The system needs to detect non-liquid particles, bacteria, yeasts, mold, and/or spores in a continuous\nliquid stream. Any proposed sensing methodology must not\nphysically interact with the liquid flowing in the interior of\nthe channel. In operation, the detection system should\nreport any contamination; the nature of the contamination\ncan be determined later. A proposed solution need not identify the specific contaminant. An optical or light-based system\nis desired, but a variety of technologies may be acceptable if\nthey do not require the fluid flow to be sampled directly.\nRespond to this TechNeed at:\nwww.techbriefs.com/tn/201406d.html\nEmail: nasatech@yet2.com\nPhone: 781-972-0600\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2014\n\nwww.techbriefs.com\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nWe become your strategic partner to \xef\xac\x81nd contract employees who \xef\xac\x81t perfectly.\nYour Aerotek account manager lives and breathes your industry and organization\nand works with you to create a staf\xef\xac\x81ng plan that meets your business needs.\nOur recruiters interview candidates and recommend only the ones who \xef\xac\x81t your\nrequirements to a T.

That event signaled the\nfirst human-like robot to arrive in space to become a permanent resident of the laboratory. Jointly developed by\nNASA and General Motors, R2 showcases how a robotic\nassistant can work alongside humans, whether tasks are\ndone in space or on Earth in a manufacturing facility.\nR2 now consists of a head and a torso with two arms\nand two hands. With the addition of the climbing legs,\nthe robot can augment its chief role: to help astronauts by taking over some of their duties on the space\nstation. But before R2 is up and running with its new\nlimbs, there\xe2\x80\x99s some assembly required.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a number of upgrades we\xe2\x80\x99re doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nRobonaut 2 with his climbing legs.\n(NASA)\nRon Diftler, Robonaut Project Manager at NASA\nJohnson Space Center. \xe2\x80\x9cIn sending up the legs, we also\nhave to change things inside R2\xe2\x80\x99s body.\xe2\x80\x9d That includes new computers, new wiring, mechanical assembly, and interfacing the legs to R2\xe2\x80\x99s main processor. \xe2\x80\x9cWe see about 20 hours of ISS\ncrew time to do the task, following detailed procedures and done over at least a month,\xe2\x80\x9d\nDiftler said.\nRight now, R2\xe2\x80\x99s torso, head, and arms are secured to a stationary base, so crewmembers\ntake tasks to the robot. But getting a \xe2\x80\x9cleg up\xe2\x80\x9d on mobility extends the jobs R2 can perform. \xe2\x80\x9cWe call them the 3 Ds: the dull, dangerous, and dirty,\xe2\x80\x9d Diftler noted. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what\nrobots are for.

The syngas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is finally converted into kerosene by using commercial Fischer-Tropsch technology.\nAlthough still at an early stage of development, the processing of syngas to kerosene is\nalready being deployed by companies, including Shell, on a global scale. This combined\napproach has the potential to provide a secure, sustainable, and scalable supply of renewable aviation fuel, and more generally for transport applications. Fischer-Tropsch derived\nkerosene is already approved for commercial aviation.\nVisit www.solar-jet.aero to learn more.\n8\n\n> Next Month in NTB\nThe July issue will feature special\ncoverage on Data Acquisition &\nSensing, as well as new electronics\nproducts on the market.\n\nCONNECT WITH NTB\nfacebook.com/NASATechBriefs\nlinkedin.com/company/\ntech-briefs-media\ntwitter.com/NASATechBriefs\n\nwww.techbriefs.com\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nAgilent\xe2\x80\x99s Electronic Measurement Group,\nincluding its 9,500 employees and 12,000\nproducts, is becoming Keysight Technologies.\nLearn more at www.keysight.com\n\nFree Info at http://info.hotims.com/49746-707\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s Who at NASA\nDr. Mary Ann Meador, Senior Research Scientist,\nGlenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH\n\nD\n\nr. Mary Ann\nMeador, Senior Research Scientist at NASA Glenn,\nguides projects that\nwill synthesize new\ntypes of aerogels.\nHer research has\nfocused on the design and development of new polymers\nfor a variety of applications, including\nhigh-temperature composites.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs: What are aerogels\nused for?\nDr. Mary Ann Meador: Aerogels are\nlow-density solids with a high degree of\nporosity \xe2\x80\x94 85 to 98%. Different than\nfoams, aerogels have extremely small\npores, on the nanometer scale. This\nmakes them 2 to 5 times better insulators\nthan foams, since gas phase heat conduction is very poor. Since they are com-\n\nprised mostly of air, they also have very\nlow dielectric constants, and hence have\napplication as low-dielectric substrates\nfor devices such as lightweight antennas.\nAerogels also have very large internal surface areas, which means they could also\nbe used as sensor platforms. However,\nthe main application is as insulation for\naerospace, housing, and construction, or\nhigh-performance clothing.\nNTB: What are the weaknesses of previous aerogels?\nDr. Meador: The issue with aerogels is\ntheir fragility. They have a lot of interesting properties. Because of the way\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re made, they have very small pore\nsizes; that leads to really good insulation\nqualities, and also very low thermal conductivities, low dielectric, and high surface areas. Because they also have typically been very fragile, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to put\nthem into use as a monolithic material.\n\nNTB: What were your biggest challenges when creating a polyimide aerogel?\nDr. Meador: With the polyimides, our\ngoal was to improve the mechanical properties so that you would retain all the\ninteresting properties of aerogels, but add\nthe mechanical integrity. We actually were\nworking on a project to design a flexible\ninsulation for inflatable aerodynamic\ndecelerators for Entry, Descent and\nLanding (EDL). These are essentially\nlarge structures that inflate in order to\nprovide drag to slow a spacecraft down, or\nto slow down another payload to land on\nthe surface of a planet like Mars or even\nbring things back to Earth. The challenge\nwas to make the aerogel in a flexible form.\nThe insulation has to be able to withstand certain heat of re-entry, so we\nchose polyimide as a very-high-temperature stable polymer. Making the aerogel\nstructure from the polymer gives us the\nability to make thin films of the aerogel.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what provides the flexible form of\nthe insulation.\nNTB: What are the possibilities with\nthis new flexibility?\n\nT/TR family of absolute position\nsensors feature repeatability to\n2\xce\xbcm. They are ideal for\nmachine automation\nand control\napplications\nwhere precise repeatability and long life\nare requirements. These sensors offer\na proven solution for applications with\nalignment errors. T/TR position sensors\nare available with a return spring too for\nuse in auto-retraction systems.\n\nNovotechnik\xe2\x80\x99s T/TR family shares\nthese key specs:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRepeatability to \xc2\xb10.002 mm\nStroke lengths from 10 to 150 mm\nLong life of >100 million movements\nLinearity to \xc2\xb10.075%\nPlug or cable connection\n\nFor complete information on T/TR sensors visit www.novotechnik.com/ttr\nNovotechnik U.S., Inc.\n155 Northboro Road \xe2\x80\xa2 Southborough, MA 01772\nTelephone: 508-485-2244 Fax: 508-485-2430\n\nWant to learn more?\nRegister for a live webcast on NASA\nGlenn\xe2\x80\x99s aerogel technology featuring Dr. Meador on June 19.

Thin films\ncould be used to wrap around a cryotank, to wrap around pipes that are\nhandling cryogenic liquids, or they can\nbe wrapped around things that you want\nto keep heat in. We think the commercial potential for other types of polymer\naerogels would be higher since they may\nbe more cost-competitive with conventional insulation. We are working on\npolyimide aerogels as an alternative,\nlower-cost option.\nTo read a full transcript of the interview or\nlisten to a downloadable podcast, visit\nwww.techbriefs.com/podcast.\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\nIn\xef\xac\x81nite Designs, One Platform\nwith the only complete\nsystem design environment\n\nNI LabVIEW is the only comprehensive development environment with the\n\nLabVIEW system\ndesign software offers\nunrivaled hardware\nintegration and helps\nyou program the way\nyou think\xe2\x80\x93graphically.\n\nunprecedented hardware integration and wide-ranging compatibility you need to meet\nany measurement and control application challenge.

The agency has a portfolio of 3000 patents and pending applications available now\nfor license by businesses and individuals, including these recently patented inventions:\n\nNon-Collinear Valve Actuator\nU.S. Patent No. 8,322,685\n\nJames A. Richard, Marshall Space\nFlight Center, AL\nTo regulate the flow of a quarter-turn\nvalve, the weight of a flight system\xe2\x80\x99s valve\nactuator must be reduced. Previous actuators have placed a pressure-actuated\npiston and return spring system exclusively in line with one another. The\nweight of return spring systems in the\nvalve actuators, therefore, has depended\nupon the piston\xe2\x80\x99s displacement.\nA non-collinear valve actuator includes\na primary actuating system and a return\nspring system. Both systems act on different points of a rotably affixed transmission link, which is one component of a\nlinkage technology responsible for opening and closing a quarter-turn valve.\nHaving the primary actuating system\napply force at a greater radial distance\nthan the return spring system increases\nstroke length while minimizing displacement. By allowing the primary actuating\nsystem to undergo longer strokes, the\nweight of the primary actuating system\nmay be optimized. Furthermore, the\nnon-collinear positioning and diminished displacement reduces the weight\nof the return spring system and ultimately the weight of the valve actuator.\n\nUltraminiature Broadband\nLight Source with Spiral\nShaped Filament\nU.S. Patent No. 8,264,134\n\nJoseph S. Collura, Henry Helvajian,\nMichael Pocha, Glenn A. Meyer,\nCharles F. McConaghy, Barry L. Olsen,\nand William W. Hansen, Glenn\nResearch Center, Cleveland, OH\nWhite light sources are used to calibrate spectrometers in the visible range.\nIt is desirable, therefore, to have an output source that spans past the visible\nlight spectrum: red, orange, yellow,\ngreen, blue, indigo, and violet.\n\nAn ultraminiature light source features a generally planar, double-spiralshaped tungsten filament suspended\nwithin a ceramic base. A lid, which is partially transparent, is placed over the\nceramic base. The lid may also be coated\nwith dielectric material to selectively\ntransfer specific radiation bands that are\nselective to the application. The ceramic\nenclosure includes a reflective bottom, a\nledge, and a raised perimeter having a\nmetallic surface. The ledge features\nmetallic surfaces embedded therein for\nelectrical communication with the double-spiral shaped tungsten filament.\n\nVariably Transmittive,\nElectronically Controlled\nEyewear\nU.S. Patent No. 8,411,214\n\nJohn J. Chapman, Louis J. Glaab,\nTimothy D. Schott, Charles T. Howell,\nand Vincent J. Fleck, Langley\nResearch Center, Hampton, VA\nSpecific pilot training and evaluation\nprocedures for instrument flight rating\nqualification currently involve the use of\nan opaque hood draped across an aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s windscreen. The hood restricts or\nobscures the student pilot\xe2\x80\x99s vision during instrument-only flight sessions.\nThere is a need for a training technique\nthat restricts the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s field of view\nwhile providing a more realistic and\nsafer training experience.\nA flight training and evaluation system\nincludes electronically activated vision\nrestriction glasses that detect the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s\nhead position and automatically darken\nand limit the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s ability to see\nthrough the front and side windscreens.\nThus, the pilot-in-training sees only within the aircraft cockpit, forcing him or\nher to fly with instruments in the most\nrestricted operational mode.\n\nFor more information on the inventions described here, contact the appropriate NASA\nField Center\xe2\x80\x99s Innovative Partnerships (IP) Office.

It\xe2\x80\x99s 3D printing,\nand it is shaping the future of manufacturing. NASA Tech Briefs spoke recently with executives at\nfour of the leading 3D printer vendors about what 3D printing is today, what it will be tomorrow,\nand if it really will change the world.\nOur roundtable panel members are Jeff Moe, Founder and CEO of Aleph Objects; Bre Pettis, CEO\nof MakerBot; Greg Mark, CEO of MarkForged; Conor MacCormack, Co-founder and CEO of Mcor\nTechnologies; and Jon Cobb, Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs for Stratasys.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs: 3D printing is being\nreferred to as the next industrial revolution. Is\nit really on a par with where the personal computer was in the 1980s \xe2\x80\x93 on the cusp of being\na ubiquitous technology that pervades both\nour work and home lives, or is that democratization of the technology still years away?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nGreg Mark: Nobody knows. Technology has a way of sneaking up on you,\nbut it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to predict exactly when\nthat will occur, or how people will use it.\nBre Pettis: We do see the 3D printing\nindustry paralleling the personal computer industry. Thirty years ago, consumers\nused to ask the question, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do I need a\ncomputer in my home? I have a calculator.\xe2\x80\x9d Today, everyone has a computer more\npowerful than we ever dreamed of right in\nhis or her pocket \xe2\x80\x93 their smartphone. We see 3D printing going in\nthe same direction.\nJeff Moe: 3D printing technology is a few years away from\nbecoming ubiquitous. Today, we do have customers around the\nworld using our machines, but right now, the 3D printing market reminds me of Linux in the 1990s. For us, ease of use cannot and will not come at the expense of making good hardware.\nJon Cobb: 3D printing could be the next industrial revolution because it has a broader impact. Individuals have the capability to design and print personal products. Embracing this\ninnovative technology will fuel not only a change in the design\nand manufacturing process, but also distribution.\nConor MacCormack: I relish our industry\xe2\x80\x99s challenge of creating a 3D printer for everyone, an ecosystem to support it, and\nthe true democratization of innovation. A new group of users,\neveryday consumers, are less technically skilled, less driven to\nmaster every aspect of 3D printing, but just as interested in the\ntechnology\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make things they need.\nNTB: There is a new job title in design and manufacturing called\n\xe2\x80\x9cmaker.\xe2\x80\x9d How does that incorporate what the designer and engineer currently do, and what does the \xe2\x80\x9cmaker\xe2\x80\x9d do that is a separate function?\nCobb: I believe today\xe2\x80\x99s makers are what we called \xe2\x80\x9ccraftsmen\xe2\x80\x9d in the past. Makers look at a problem and design a\n14\n\nWe focus on customer\nfeedback \xe2\x80\x93 people looking to\nprint parts with the strength\nof metal, at their desk. That\nwill enable thousands of\nengineers to fabricate parts\nwhen they need them, without waiting in a long queue\nfor machine time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGreg Mark\nMarkForged\n\nsolution. The 3D printer, along with software that is becoming much easier to use, allows the maker to solve his or her\nown problem, on their own terms, and within their own\ntimeframe.\nMark: I suspect it means different things to different people.\nIn the consumer space, it may be a synonym for \xe2\x80\x9chobbyist.\xe2\x80\x9d In\nthe industrial space, it may be a synonym for fabricator.\nMacCormack: Makers are technically savvy early adopters\nwho have gone online, purchased hobbyist 3D printers, and\ntinkered with the technology. Many makers are designers and\nengineers, but not all. These are the people who constantly\npush the envelope of what the technology can do for them\nboth professionally and personally.\nMoe: As the maker movement gets more sophisticated, it follows that companies are creating positions for these types of\ntalented individuals with diverse skill sets. Generally, we understand makers to be inquisitive self-starters who aren\xe2\x80\x99t afraid to\nget their hands dirty. Ultimately, a maker\xe2\x80\x99s job function will\ndepend on what companies need.\nPettis: Today, with the help of 3D printing, creative individuals are now being heralded as the new \xe2\x80\x9cmakers\xe2\x80\x9d of our\ngeneration. Their talents and skills to move ideas from concept to reality through the process of making are being celebrated. 3D printing brings innovation and iteration to the\nforefront.\n\nwww.techbriefs.com\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nMULTIBODY DYNAMICS: Model of a three-cylinder\n\nVERIFY AND OPTIMIZE YOUR DESIGNS WITH\n\nCOMSOL MULTIPHYSICS\n\n\xc2\xae\n\nMultiphysics tools let you build simulations that accurately\nreplicate the important characteristics of your designs.

As a flurry of 3D\nprinting-related companies grow out\nof open-source hardware projects like\nRepRap, we are seeing comparable\ngrowth in related materials, technologies, software, and services. Then\nagain, we never know when the market will surprise us because something new could always be near the\nhorizon.\nJeff Moe\nMark: Everything has a niche. SLA\nAleph Objects\nis really great for jewelry and dental\napplications. FDM is unbeatable for\ntooling and structural parts. Objet is\ngreat for simulating plastic with overmolding. And carbon filament fabrication (CFF) is great for printing parts with the strength of\nmetal, and the low-friction surface of Nylon. It\xe2\x80\x99s also useful to\ntailor the composite to the application. For example, fiberglass\ncan be used if you want the part to be transparent to RF. Carbon\nfiber can be used if you want to attenuate RF and provide heat\nsyncing.\nMacCormack: I think people believe that all the methods for\nmaking 3D objects have already been invented. On the contrary, we\xe2\x80\x99re working on new ways to print 3D objects in our\nR&D labs that, if successful, will really cause a revolution, not\njust an evolution.\nPettis: MakerBot is currently committed to FDM 3D printing. Our focus is about making 3D printing affordable and\naccessible on your desktop, and FDM is the safest, most versatile form of 3D printing.\nCobb: I believe all other companies are working to deliver more materials that are well defined in their strength,\nflexibility, and other properties. I think PolyJet technology\ngives us good insight into the future where 3D printers can\nprint multiple materials with colors, clear or opaque, and\nsmooth or textured surfaces. In short, it\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturing in\na box.\n\n3D printing technology\nis a few years away from\nbecoming ubiquitous. Right\nnow, the 3D printing market\nreminds me of Linux in the\n1990s. For us, ease of use cannot and will not come at the\nexpense of making good\nhardware.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNTB: Industry has seen the introduction of 3D printers that use a\nvariety of materials \xe2\x80\x93 or multiple materials in one machine. How do\nmanufacturers decide, in many cases, between function and aesthetics\nwhen selecting the right machine and material?\nMoe: Manufacturers should not be forced to choose a\nmachine because it comes with a certain proprietary printing\nmaterial, or is designed to only use one type of printing material. Material developers around the world are consistently innovating and we enjoy bringing their new products to our community. When experimental materials face constraints, developers\nwill introduce new tools and accessories to overcome them.\nMacCormack: Users will dictate applications, and applications will dictate material requirements. For example, we\nselected ordinary paper as the primary build medium for our\n3D printers because people couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get access to the technology. They demanded much lower cost and ubiquitous consumables,. However, if you want to make an injector nozzle for an\nengine, the real-world loading will dictate the material and\nhence the technology.\nMark: We focused on customer feedback \xe2\x80\x94 people looking\nto print parts with the strength of metal, at their desk. That will\nenable thousands of engineers to fabricate parts when they\nneed them, without waiting in a long queue for machine time.\nPettis: We focus on desktop 3D printing and because of that,\nwe also focus on safe and easy-to-use\nmaterial that can be used in the office,\nhome, or classroom. We empower individuals to be creative right at their desk.\nCobb: Manufacturers are looking to\nsolve a specific problem. Frequently,\n3D printing is seen as a potential solution. 3D printing is similar to many\nmanufacturing processes that are\nemployed today, and these processes\ncan and often rely on secondary\nprocesses. The part material takes\nprecedent.\n\nNTB: We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the evolution of the technology in 3D printing\nmachines. What about the evolution on the software side?

Is the software keeping up with the hardware?\nMark: The CAD vendors are doing a\ngreat job.\nCobb: Software to drive 3D printing is\nproliferating. Software that is easy to use\nis becoming available to a wide segment\nof the population. I believe manufacturers will need to work on developing software that will bridge the design-to-manufacturing process, making it seamless.\n\nMacCormack: Just as the iPod relies\non a vast content store from which to\nbuy your music, the 3D printer of the\nfuture will be part of a lush ecosystem of\ncontent and capabilities. And this\necosystem needs to develop at the same\nrate as the machines.

The printer, designed and built by Made in Space\n(Moffett Field, CA), will be able to print parts from files sent to the crew on the ISS. We recently spoke with\nMichael Snyder, Director of R&D for Made in Space, and Niki Werkheiser, 3D Printing in Zero-G Project Manager\nin the Technology Development and Transfer Office at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Marshall Space Flight Center (Alabama).\nNASA Tech Briefs: How does the printer differ from a commercial 3D printer?\nMichael Snyder: We\nstarted off doing simulated flights in the zero-g parabolic aircraft with the\nambition to modify commercial printers to work in\nmicrogravity. Through a\ncouple days of testing, we\nrealized that the things\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d end up modifying to\nmake the systems work\nMichael Snyder, Director of R&D\nwere pretty substantial. It\nfor Made in Space. (Emmett Given/\nNASA MSFC)\nended up being a lot better for us to build it from\nthe ground up because of the differences from microgravity to Earth gravity. The process itself is basically the same.\nThere was no \xe2\x80\x9ceureka\xe2\x80\x9d moment in terms of the process\nbeing totally different. The mechanics are slightly different, and those slight differences cause substantial defects in\nthe prints.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to email parts to space as soon as the printer is installed in the glovebox. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be in our offices in\nSilicon Valley, be able to hit \xe2\x80\x9csend,\xe2\x80\x9d and the part file will be\non the printer in a matter of seconds.\nNTB: How are NASA and Made in Space working together on\nthis project?\nNiki Werkheiser: Made\nin Space, although they\nare making the first 3D\nprinter in space, is interested in the longer term\nand creating an industry.\nEnabling space exploration is the ultimate goal.\nTo enable exploration,\nthe key first step would be\nto manufacture and have\nindependence from Earthbased launches \xe2\x80\x93 to manufacture the part you need\non demand. All of the\nflight certification and mission testing for the printer\nis occurring at NASA, and\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re packing it so it\xe2\x80\x99s safe\nfor launch.\n\nThe goal is to take a plastic part made out of the feedstock materials and recycle it back into filament. That will\nbe a very exciting day in space when you can do that,\nbecause then you\xe2\x80\x99re actually showing the first concept of\ntrue independent sustainability. Imagine a day when we\ncan take old food packaging and recycle it back into feedstock material. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that far off.\nNTB: Are there other applications for this printer?\nSnyder: We see this technology being very useful for a\nwide variety of applications \xe2\x80\x93 not just based on space. We\xe2\x80\x99re\nin conversations with a lot of people in pretty much every\nindustry and government arm you can think of. It\xe2\x80\x99s really\nexciting and this is relatively brand new \xe2\x80\x94 thinking of this\ntechnology as more than just a toy. We can really revolutionize how things are made and how quickly they can be made.\nImagine in war, your Humvee breaks down but you have a\nprinter. You can fix your Humvee and be back on the road\nin a matter of hours instead of waiting for people to come\nhelp you.\nWerkheiser: The Navy is very interested in its use in\nsubmarines. Obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s very remote, like the space station, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working together with Made in\nSpace with these entities. Ultimately, to develop the technology, our endpoint applications may be different, but\nthere is overlap in the core set of capabilities we both\nneed to see developed.\nNTB: This project will reduce the distance goods will need to go,\nand reduce launch costs?\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Niki Werkheiser holds a 3D\nprinted Cubesat structure, one of\nthe many potential applications\nthat an in-space manufacturing\ncapability will provide. (Emmett\nGiven/NASA MSFC)\n\n22\n\nSnyder: Absolutely. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we set out to do is disrupt\nthe supply chain and make it more convenient, eventually\neliminating the need for launch vehicles. When you\xe2\x80\x99re out\nexploring places like Mars, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have the capability\nyou have on the station. Imagine going to Mars and having\nfeedstock that you can transform into backup environmental control systems or refrigerators. You can do that with\nthe same material and not have to store spares, which\nreduces mass.\nRight now, this technology is capable of doing great\nthings, and it needs to be viewed the same way we view a drill\npress or a CNC machine. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually better because of the\nextended capability it gives you. It will be a matter of time\nbefore people finally open their eyes fully and realize how\nmuch this changes everything.\nFor more information, visit www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/\nstation/research/experiments/1115.html or www.madeinspace.com.\n\nwww.techbriefs.com\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nNew C-more Touch Panels\n\xc2\xae\n\n$\n\nHigher Performance, Lower Price\n\n6\xe2\x80\x9d Color TFT\n00\n\n499.\n\nu.s.\n\nEA9-T6CL-R\nSerial only\n\n$\n\n10\xe2\x80\x9d Color TFT\n\n1290.00\n\nu.s.\n\nEA9-T10CL\nSerial and Ethernet\n\n6\xe2\x80\x9d Color TFT\n$\n00\n\n699.\n\nu.s.\nEA9-T6CL\nSerial and Ethernet\n\n12\xe2\x80\x9d Color TFT\n\n$\n\n8\xe2\x80\x9d Color TFT\n$\n00\n\n999.\n\n1790.00\n\nu.s.\n\nEA9-T12CL\nSerial and Ethernet\n\nu.s.\n\nEA9-T8CL\nSerial and Ethernet\n\n$\n\n15\xe2\x80\x9d Color TFT\n\n1999.00\n\nu.s.\n\nEA9-T15CL\nSerial and Ethernet\n\nThe popular C-more HMIs have\nALWAYS been a great value, but now\nthey are better than ever.

However, most pilots/autonomous systems are unable to adapt to the altered\nconfiguration and learn to control the\ndamaged aircraft in the very short time\navailable for safe operation. Fortunately,\nthe flight computer may have the necessary information as well as bandwidth\navailable to learn the new dynamics and\ndetermine mechanisms to control the\nvehicle quickly. The flight computer needs\nan intelligent controller that flies the vehicle with the baseline controller during\nnormal conditions, and adapts the design\nwhen the vehicle suffers damage. Using\ninformation about the vehicle from all the\navailable sensors, the system determines\nwhether the vehicle is damaged. Direct\nadaptive control (DAC) looks directly at\nthe errors, and updates the control law\n\naccordingly. This technology looks not just\nat the tracking error, but rather its characteristics over time to determine whether\nthe controller needs to be adapted or left\nalone. This is typically fast and meets the\ntiming considerations for aircraft/spacecraft system implementation.\nThis technology presents a novel, stable, discrete-time adaptive law for flight\ncontrol in a DAC framework. Where\nerrors are not present, the original control design has been tuned for optimal\nperformance. Adaptive control works\ntowards achieving nominal performance\nwhenever the design has modeling\nuncertainties/errors or when the vehicle\nsuffers substantial flight configuration\nchange. The baseline controller uses\ndynamic inversion with proportionalintegral augmentation. On-line adaptation of this control law is achieved by\nproviding a parameterized augmentation signal to a dynamic inversion block.\nThe parameters of this augmentation\n\nsignal are updated to achieve the nominal desired error dynamics.\nIf the system senses that at least one\naircraft component is experiencing an\nexcursion and the return of this component value toward its reference value is\nnot proceeding according to the expected controller characteristics, then the\nneural network (NN) modeling of aircraft operation may be changed.\nThis work was done by John T.

All hyperspectral\ninstruments face the difficult task of spectral feature selection (finding the spectral\nbands that matter), especially those that\noperate in previously unstudied arenas\nencountered in planetary missions. This\nsoftware demonstrates how manually annotated labels can enable automated feature\ndiscovery that boosts science return.\n\nThis work evaluates the ability of automated classifiers to detect sulfur in\nremote sensing observations by the\nHyperion spectrometer on the EO-1\n(Earth Observing-1) spacecraft. A datadriven machine learning solution was\nrequired because it is not possible to reliably detect sulfur in hyperspectral data by\nsimply matching observations to sulfur lab\nspectra, as is common for in-situ mineral\nimaging. Several methods (manual and\nautomated) were evaluated to select the\nmost relevant attributes (spectral bands)\nfor successful sulfur detection.\nData was taken from an Earthly analog\nfor Europa: a northern island where\n\n26\n\nbioactivity has produced surface sulfur\ndeposits on ice. This software uses\nmachine learning algorithms to automatically discover the best spectral features\nthat discriminate interesting spectra from\nuninteresting surrounding spectra such\nas observations of ice, rock, and exposed\nsulfur deposits. Unique aspects of this\nstudy include ground validation using terrestrial sulfuric ice springs, modern\nmachine learning feature detection using\na Support Vector Machine (SVM), and\nreal-time execution onboard the EO-1\nspacecraft.

The\nswitches are intended to handle kiloamplevel currents and may dissipate peak\npowers measured in megawatts. Recent\nexperiments measured the response of a\nswitch module composed of eight\nSGTOs to single-short, high-current pulses.

Spacers were eliminated from the model; they have no significant influence on the thermal\nresponse of the switch in the timespans\nstudied (see figure).\nThe initial temperature of the model\nand of the air surrounding it was defined to\nbe 70 \xc2\xb0C.

Curves of power versus time were culled from much larger files\nof data recorded at 0.1-microsecond (\xce\xbcs)\nintervals. It was assumed that the switch\nmodule distributes the power equally\namong the SGTOs. In the simulation,\npower was applied uniformly throughout\nthe active part of the die, rather than applying it solely to a junction within the die.\nWhile the active part of the die reached\na temperature in excess of 130 \xc2\xb0C, that part\nof the die is covered with a lid, and the\nobservable part of the module has reached\na maximum temperature of about 100 \xc2\xb0C.\nLittle of the heat in the first pulse has been\nconducted outside the active die in 35 \xce\xbcs.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9coff\xe2\x80\x9d time is 1.66 s, at the end of which\nthe die has almost returned to its initial\ntemperature of 70 \xc2\xb0C.\nNext, how the temperature of the\nSGTOs rose and fell during a series of pulses was calculated. Two cases were used. The\nfirst was five 35- s pulses in a 4-s period, and\nthe second was four 35- s pulses in a 5-s\nperiod to see whether or not the temperature of the devices stays within a safe operational range. SGTOs return almost to the\noriginal baseline temperature between\npulses, and the average temperature rises\nwith each pulse to just over 130 \xc2\xb0C. Silicon\ndevices may not operate as efficiently at\nsuch temperatures as they do at room temperature, but are not likely to be damaged\nby such short transits to high temperatures.\nThere still is little sign of heat spreading\nthrough the module after 5 s, and visible\ntemperatures are within one degree of\nthose at the peak of the first pulse.\nThe second set of calculations used a\n54-\xce\xbcs-wide pulse as a thermal input to the\nSGTO switch model. Peak power is 1.5\nMW per SGTO, assuming equal distribution of power among the SGTOs in the\nmodule. As with the 35-ms pulse case, the\nthermal effects of a single pulse, a series\nof five pulses in 4 s, and four pulses in 5\ns were calculated. The longer pulse raises\nthe device temperature over 140 \xc2\xb0C,\nabout 10 \xc2\xb0C higher than the 35-ms pulse.\nThe effects of 4- and 5-pulse trains with\nthe 54-ms pulse were calculated. As each\npulse was applied, the average temperature in the active part of the SGTOs rose\nto more than 140 \xc2\xb0C, and returned\nalmost to the baseline temperature\n\nbetween pulses. The SGTO temperature\nat the end of the last pulse in both cases\nwas approximately 144 \xc2\xb0C.\nThe model shows a quick rise in the temperature of the SGTOs during the pulse,\nbut peak temperatures are within safe\noperating limits for Si devices. The heat in\nthe devices dissipates quickly into the surrounding package and into the cold plate\nto which it is mounted. Heat conduction\noccurs rapidly enough that the devices\xe2\x80\x99\ntemperature returns very close to their initial temperature within about 1 s after the\nend of the pulse. Calculations predict that\n\nthe peak temperatures in the SGTOs will\nincrease little over time when a series of\nshort pulses over 4 or 5 s is applied. This\nindicates that the switches should be able\nto withstand repeated cycling at high\npower levels without sustaining heat-related damage or suffering serious degradation of performance.\nThis work was done by Gregory K.

The aero-heating of the solar\npanels during aerobraking in the warmer\nVenus thermal environment is considered riskier than Mars aerobraking.\nMost missions were not optimized for\naerobraking, particularly the solar-panel\nand spacecraft-shape aspect ratio and\nthermal features. Mars aerobraking had\nmore uncertainty, but lower solar heating rates and more actual mission data.\nVenus has more solar heating, higher\ninitial temperature conditions, and\nfewer real-life examples, but less atmos-\n\npheric change. Lingering aerobraking\nrisks applied to such missions in the\nearly stage required more aggressive\nearly-phase reduction of risks. Older\ndesigns did not pursue aggressive solar\npanel thermal load reduction features,\nor optimization of temperature, and\ninstead focused on heat rate corridors.\nThis approach combines multiple new\nfeatures into one combined solution.\nThe first feature is lower heating from\npast designs by applying the lowest\naspect ratio solar-panel layout, resulting\nin lowest heating for the solar-panel area\nrequired for the mission. A new \xe2\x80\x9cpicture\nframe\xe2\x80\x9d edge is added to solar panels.\nThe outside 3 to 6 in. (\xe2\x89\x887.6 to 15.2 cm)\nof the panels are directed 45 to 30\xc2\xb0 into\nthe flow. This reduces heating by an\nadditional 15%. The projected drag surface is increased, which reduces the ballistic coefficient that can be used to\neither decrease aerobraking duration or\nincrease thermal margin. These edges,\nwhich receive higher heat flux, are pro-\n\ntected with high-temperature multi-layer\ninsulation.\nThe new high-temperature solar panel\nfeatures high-temperature graphite epoxy\nfacesheet and solar array design. The\nsolar arrays are pre-cooled by turning\naway from the Sun a mission-specific number of minutes before the drag pass. The\ndeveloped thermal analysis integrated\nwith the trajectory simulation approach is\nused to fly a temperature corridor instead\nof a heat-rate corridor, which results in\nbetter control of temperatures. This yielded an overall aerobraking approach with\nshorter aerobraking durations and substantial temperature margins.\nThis work was done by Charles Baker,\nMichael Amato, David Steinfeld, and Jeff\nStewart of Goddard Space Flight Center; and Jill\nPrince, Derek Liechty, and John Dec of Langley\nResearch Center.

GSC-16407-1\n\nLow-Cost, Very Large Diamond-Turned Metal Mirror\nReliable plating and diamond-turning technologies produce visible quality mirrors for\napplications such as semiconductor manufacturing.\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama\nThis innovation is a method for fabricating a low-cost, lightweight, large-aperture mirror by constructing only the mirror substrate by electroforming on a\nmaster form machined from plastic\nfoam. Electroformed tubes of the same\nNiP alloy are installed in the foam mirror substrate master. Installing electroformed NiP tubes in the plastic mirror\nmaster before plating on the plastic\nfoam mirror substrate allows the mirror\nfaceplate and the back surface of the\nmirror to be plated onto the ends of the\nconnecting tubes in the foam plastic.\n\nRemoval of the foam after plating is\ncomplete results in a very stiff and lightweight mirror substrate made only of a\nsingle material. The low cost of the electroformed mirror substrate is made possible by very fast production of a master\nsurface made of plastic foam that can be\nrapidly machined with modern, highspeed machining technology to very\ngood mechanical tolerances in only a\nfew hours.\nNo expensive and laboriously produced master surface is required for\nreplication as in traditional electroform-\n\n38\n\ning of optical mirrors. After the plastic\nform has been encapsulated with a suitably thick NiP deposit, the plastic is dissolved away with a solvent. This leaves a\nhollow, electroformed mirror substrate.\nThe excellent diamond machinability of\nthe high-phosphorus nickel allows the\nelectroformed surface to be diamond\nturned to produce a highly accurate and\nvery smooth optical surface.\nThe extremely low cutting forces of\ndiamond turning can produce visible\nwavelength quality optical surfaces without applying any heavy forces to the mir-\n\nwww.techbriefs.com\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nProduct(ive) Development\nAt Proto Labs, our quick-turn manufacturing processes allow you to\nfail fast, so you can succeed faster with market-ready parts.\n\nInjection Molding\nPart Design for Dummies\n\nThe road to prototype parts can often be long and\nwinding with other shops.

The plated-in array of tubular\nstructures allows the interior of the hollow mirror to be open\nand easily vented in a vacuum. The very low cutting force of\ndiamond turning allows the mirror faceplate to be made very\nthin to lower the areal density of the mirror. The low cutting\nforce also minimizes the tendency for print-through of the\ninternal support points of the tubular sections connecting the\nmirror face plate to the mirror back plate.\nExcellent visible quality optical figure and surface finish can\nbe produced by diamond turning. Surface finishes on diamond-turned NiP alloy as smooth as 0.6 nm rms have been\n\nobtained without any post-polishing of the diamond turned\nsurface. The fast and flexible machining of a very-low-cost,\nexpendable master form made of plastic foam, combined with\na proven electroplating process to produce a thick deposit of\ndiamond machinable NiP, results in a process for producing\nmirror substrates at a cost as small as one-thousandth the cost\nof comparable one-square-meter beryllium mirror substrate.\nThis work was done by John Casstevens of Dallas Optical Systems,\nInc. for Marshall Space Flight Center.

The viscosity of\nair is more than three orders of magnitude less than the\nthinnest oil; therefore, the frictional heating of large-diameter\nair bearings is very small and very manageable.

With current technology,\nthe cost to fabricate, and the time to produce large mirrors, is\none of the limiting factors for many missions. Research tools\nrequire large-aperture, lightweight optics that will perform\nwell in a space cryogenic environment. Currently, no mirror\ntechnology has been demonstrated that meets the mission\nrequirements at an affordable cost.\nDiamond turning has been proven to produce highly aspheric optical contours to visible wavelength tolerances with\nextremely smooth surfaces. Diamond turning has the additional enabling capability to not only produce extremely smooth\nand accurate optical surfaces, but also mechanical attachment\nsurfaces and datums that allow extremely fast and complex optical components to be quickly and easily aligned. The productivity of diamond turning allows the production of quantities of\noptical components with exacting duplication of optical surfaces and datums, which allow \xe2\x80\x9csnap-together\xe2\x80\x9d optical systems.\nThe large diamond turning machines that have been built\nall have oil hydrostatic work spindles that fail in diamond- turning very large optical components because of excessive heat\ngeneration when this type bearing is made large enough to\nhave the required load capacity for very large optics diamond\nturning.\nThe solution to this problem is to make large vertical air bearings with hard metal journals running against porous graphite\nbearing surfaces. Porous graphite air bearings do not friction\nweld in the event of the spindle bearing surface contacting the\nbearing journal surface, and the result is only slight polishing of\nthe graphite surface. The porous graphite flow structure provides extremely uniform flow of the air film, and the tortuous\nflow path acts to damp the flow-induced dynamic instability that\nis a severe problem in both oil and air hydrostatic bearings.\nThis work was done by John Casstevens of Dallas Optical Systems for\nMarshall Space Flight Center.

It has shown to have an extremely\nstable emittance at lower wavelengths\nwithin the infrared (IR) spectrum,\nwhere energy dissipation is critical at elevated temperatures. The coating has\ndemonstrated increases in surface texturing, and ultimately an increase in\nemissivity when exposed to temperatures up to 2,050 \xc2\xb0F ( 1,120 \xc2\xb0C). It is\nalso stable at continuous run, elevated\ntemperatures, and shows no signs of\nspalling or erosion.\nRadiation-cooled nozzles for liquid\nrocket engines require high emissivity,\napproaching near black body, in order to\nproperly dissipate energy from the component. A common means of increasing\nthe emittance of metallic components is\nto perform a high-temperature heat treatment of the material, allowing the surface\nto oxidize, thus increasing the emissivity.\nHowever, an oxidized surface will reduce\nwhen exposed to the hydrogen-rich steam\nfrom the propellant by-products of liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen (LH2/LOX)\ncombustion in addition to being reduced\nwhen exposed to a hard vacuum environment. Another disadvantage of the hightemperature material oxidation is reduction of the base material properties.\n\nSome materials, such as superalloys,\nrequire a minimum heat treatment temperature to be obtained; otherwise, the\nstructural properties of the material can\nbe reduced due to carbide precipitation.\nAdditionally, distortion of larger parts\ncan occur at elevated temperatures when\nperforming heat treatment oxidation\ncycles of the material.\nA unique silica-based coating was\nadapted from industry to meet the emissivity needs of the rocket nozzle. The\nCetek coating system is an aqueous-based\nmaterial that is applied using a handheld\nsprayer that could be readily adapted to\nan automatic robot sprayer. Spray application allows even distribution of the\ncoating over the entire surface of the\ncomponent exposed to both hot gas and\nthe vacuum of space. The coating is\napplied in a series of air-sprayed layers\nthat combine to produce a total thickness of less than 0.005 in. ( 127 \xce\xbcm). The\nthin coating allows for minimal weight\nimpact by increasing the emittance of\nthe surface, ultimately decreasing component temperatures and allowing for\nreduced weight of the engine component. The cure cycle for the coating consists of an ambient air cure under controlled humidity conditions, followed by\noven heating at low temperatures for a\nperiod of a few hours.\n\nThe development of this coating was\nnecessary to increase the emittance of\nthe surface of the nozzle extension for\nthe radiation-cooled metallic nozzle\nextension for the J-2X Upper Stage\nEngine. Because the temperatures of the\nnozzle wall are dependent upon the\nradiation effectiveness, emissivity is\nextremely important. The material\nproperties of the nozzle extension are\ndependent on the temperature in which\nthey operate. A lower temperature wall\n(based on emissivity) would allow a higher strength of the base material, and\neventually weight savings of the nozzle\nbased on optimization of the design.\nThus, a higher emittance for the nozzle\nresults in weight savings for the design\nand also a design that yields additional\nthermal margin. This coating successfully completed a series of high-temperature emissivity and durability certification testing and has been shown to survive a rocket nozzle\xe2\x80\x99s extreme operating\nenvironment through both subscale and\nfull-scale testing.\nThis work was done by Paul Gradl of\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Jeff Haynes of\nPWR WPB, and Naiping Zhu of Cetek Ltd.\nFor more information, contact Sammy\nNabors, MSFC Commercialization Assistance\nLead, at sammy.a.nabors@nasa.gov.

These regulations are expected to\n\nbecome more stringent as state and\nregional authorities become more\ninvolved in addressing these environmental problems. Better systems are needed\nfor catalytic control.\n\n42\n\nIn general, existing catalytic converters used for NOx and He emission control use precious metal (PM) or their\ncombinations as wash coats with various\narchitectures over alumina on ceramic\n\nwww.techbriefs.com\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nsubstrates to effect catalytic conversion.\nSome of the more common are coatings\nof Pd, Pd/Rh, or Pt/Rh. Existing catalytic converters are less effective for\nremoval of methane HC emissions due\nto the high light-off temperatures for\nmethane on these catalysts.\nThe present invention utilizes at least\ntwo PMs with at least two different metaloxides (for example, tin-oxide plus one\nor more promoters) in a layered matrix\nto convert CO, HCs, and NOx to CO2\nand N2 by oxidation of the first two components (CO, HCs) and reduction of\nthe third (NOx) in a moderately hightemperature gaseous environment (for\nexample, between about 200 to about\n500 \xc2\xb0C) containing excess oxygen.\nPreparation of ruthenium/platinumtin-oxide-based catalyst coatings for\npellets, beads, granules, fabrics, and\nespecially ceramic honeycomb monoliths can be accomplished by successive\nlayering of the desired components, as\nfollows:\n1. A clean, dry substrate is deaerated in a\nsolution containing tin (II) 2-ethylhexanoate (SnEH). The substrate is\nremoved from the solution, and\nexcess solution is removed from the\nsubstrate. Residual solution components are evaporated leaving an SnEH\nlayer on the substrate that is thermally\ndecomposed in air to tin-oxide at 300\n\xc2\xb0C. Several layers are applied in the\nsame manner to achieve the desired\nloading of tin-oxide.\n2. The promoters are added to the catalyst matrix in a similar fashion. For\nexample, an iron oxide promoter is\nadded to an existing tin-oxide-coated\nsubstrate by deaerating in an iron\nnitrate solution, removing excess solution, evaporating the solvent, and\nfinally thermally decomposing the\nnitrate to oxide.\n3. Platinum is added to the coated substrate as above using an aqueous solution of tetraamine platinum (II) dihydroxide or other platinum salt, and\nthen thermally decomposing the salt.\nInstead of the thermal decomposition, a reductive decomposition can\nbe used. For example, the catalystcoated substrate is heated in an atmosphere containing a reducing gas, such\nas carbon monoxide or hydrogen, to\ninduce reduction of the platinum salt\nto platinum. A similar process can be\nused to add the second precious metal\n(i.e., ruthenium), for example, by\nstarting with an appropriate salt, or\nthe mixed PMs may be applied in one\nstep.\n\nThe instant catalyst can absorb the\nNOx species and convert them to NO. As\nsuch, nitrosyl complexation takes place\nwith a noble metal in order to allow it to\nreact with a reducing agent and therefore be converted to nitrogen. Preferred\nmetal-oxide promoters are Fe2O3, NiO,\nand CO2O3. The metal-oxide adduct\nwith NOx is converted to NO on desorption. The NO is subsequently transferred and bound to the PM until\nreduced by CO and HCs to N2. The CO\nand HCs are similarly oxidized by NO or\nO2 and SnO2 at the PM interface site.\n\nThe advantages of the present invention include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lower light-off temperatures can\nenable oxidation of methane emissions\nto CO2 for natural gas fueled vehicles\nat lower exhaust gas temperatures.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lower light-off temperatures for CO\nand HCs enable more efficient catalytic conversion to CO2 at lower\ncost.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A tin-oxide base wash-coat on a ceramic substrate minimizes loss of coating\nthrough cracking, peeling, or dusting\nmechanisms.\n\nCOATED\nAEROSPACE\nDEVICE\nThe Leader in Coating Aerospace,\nMedical, and Industrial Components.\n\n51 Parmenter Road, Hudson, MA 01749\n(800) 258-0110 | www.boydcoatings.com/ADT\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2014\n\nFree Info at http://info.hotims.com/49746-734\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n43\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nMaterials & Coatings\n\nO\n\n90\n\n01\n\nISO 13485\n\nAS\n\nsureffiPM\neffiand\n\nThis work was done by David Schryer and\nBilly Upchurch of Langley Research Center.

The protected structure is coated with a thin\nmetallic film of a low-melting-temperature healing agent. To heal or mitigate\ncrack damage, the structure is heated to\nthe melting temperature of the healing\nagent, allowing it to flow into the crack\nopening. Once in the crack mouth, the\nhealing agent has two benefits: (1) by\nadhering to the crack surfaces, the healing agent bridges the crack, reducing\nthe amount of load at the crack tip; and\n(2) any voluminous substance in the\ncrack mouth causes crack closure (premature crack-face contact during cyclic\nloading) that also reduces the crack-tip\nloading.\nThe technology is a coating that could\nslow crack propagation in metal aircraft\nand spacecraft structures. In practice, a\nstructure is coated with a low-temperature healing agent. When a crack is\ndetected, heat melts the healing agent\nand it flows into the crack. As the temperature is reduced, the healing agent\nhardens and heals the crack by reducing\nthe crack-tip stress intensity factor\nthrough closure and bridging.\n\nLaser machining\n\nperfection\nin stainless\nEagle has the skills\nand the technology\nrequired to produce\nall of your custom\nexotic metal parts.\nCome to us!\n\nCurrently, the technology is only\napplicable for cracks that have reached\nthe surface. It requires an external heat\nsource to heat the coated sheet to 250 to\n300 \xc2\xb0F( 120 to 150 \xc2\xb0C) and must be\nprocessed in a vacuum. The coating has\nbeen prototyped on a titanium alloy\nsheet with an indium-tin eutectic alloy\ncoating. Development continues with\nthe ultimate goal of developing the technology into an in situ healing mechanism that can work automatically with\nstructural health monitoring detectors.\nThe goal of the technology is to heal\ncracks in metal on aircraft and spacecraft.\nUltimately, the goal for the technology is\nto incorporate smart coatings that will\nenable truly self-healing materials, which\nwould provide enormous safety and\nmaintenance benefits.

The salient\nfeatures of SOFCs are all-solid construction and high-temperature electrochemical reaction-based operation, resulting\nin clean and efficient power generation\nfrom a variety of fuels. SOFCs of two different designs, tubular and planar, are\ncurrently under development. Planar\nSOFCs offer several advantages such as\nsimple manufacturing and relatively\n\nshort current path, resulting in higher\npower density and efficiency.

Thermopiles are prime candidates\nfor high-resolution thermal mapping in\nthe far-infrared (17- to 250-\xce\xbcm wavelength) spectral range. Thermopile detector arrays can be made to be very lightweight and compact. Furthermore, they\nrequire very few ancillary components\n(e.g., readout electronics, optics, amplifiers), which can add to instrument volume and mass. The implementation of\nthermopiles on these missions is likely\nbecause they (1) generate an output voltage that is proportional to the incoming\nradiation within the spectral range being\nmapped; (2) do not require an electrical\nbias or an optical chopper; (3) have negligible 1/f noise; (4) are radiation hard; and\n(5) have a reported specific detectivity of 1\n\xc3\x97 109 cm\xc2\xb7Hz1/2/W at room temperature.\nThe focus of this work is to fabricate\nthermopiles using unique semimetallic\nmaterials developed in the Detector\nDevelopment Laboratory (DDL).

The advantage in using this innovation is in achieving\nconsiderable reduction in both cost and mass of the shielding necessary to protect spacecraft from hypervelocity MMOD particle\nimpacts. For instance, in a typical application of this technology for\na visiting vehicle used to transport cargo to the International Space\nStation (ISS) over ten years, an estimated $330,000 is saved (at the\ntime of this reporting) in using a less-expensive MMOD fabric over\nconventional materials, and an estimated 2,000-kg mass is reduced\nfrom the MMOD shielding using the materials and techniques\ndescribed here compared to conventional means.\nMicro-meteoroid and orbital debris shields typically contain\nrelatively expensive ceramic fabrics. For instance, the majority\nof the MMOD shields on the ISS US Laboratory module contain six layers of ceramic cloth. The purposes of the ceramic\nfabric in MMOD shields are to break up the incoming MMOD\nparticle or hypervelocity projectile, and cause the debris resulting from the break-up to disperse laterally before impacting\nsubsequent layers of the shield. Ceramics have excellent\ndynamic properties to achieve good projectile breakup, for\neither high-density orbital debris particles or lower-density\nmeteoroid particles, by creating relatively high shock pressures\nin the impacting projectile. Analytical evaluation of various\npotential materials was conducted to determine which material has suitable characteristics for MMOD protection. Based on\nthese evaluations and cost estimates, materials that could provide suitable MMOD protection at lower cost were identified.\nUsing inexpensive fiberglass fabric in place of the more\nexpensive ceramic cloth is currently used to protect the\nSpaceX Dragon commercial cargo vehicle from MMOD particles. This innovation will likely be used on future inflatable\nmodules, and is being considered by Orbital Sciences for use\non the Cygnus commercial cargo vehicle.

All\ncommercial or custom head-mounted display systems that track the user\xe2\x80\x99s head for\nthe purpose of virtual or augmented reality applications encounter positional display errors due to system latency. A basic\nhead-mounted display (HMD) with headtracking system is comprised of (1) a nearto-eye display, (2) the head-tracking system, (3) one or more symbology or image\nsources, and (4) the display/image\nprocessor. Each element, and the communication among them, contributes a portion to the total latency. HMD system\nlatency manifests as erroneous alignment\nof the virtual and real surroundings as the\nhead is slewed, and is known to induce\nsimulator sickness and other physiological\nissues. Therefore, minimal system latency\nis a design goal to reduce these physiological symptoms. The overall latency budget\nis the sum of time required to measure\nthe dynamic head position, communicate\nthe position to the display processor, compute the scene based on the position, integrate imagery, and render the scene to\nthe display.\nThe Head-Mounted Display Latency\nMeasurement Rig (HeLMR) device (see\n\nfigure) consists of a 3D-printed, anatomically approximate human head that is able\nto \xe2\x80\x9cwear\xe2\x80\x9d all available commercial and custom HMD systems. A high-speed camera is\ninstalled in place of the eye(s) in the correct image plane location. The head is\nmounted on a precision rotary stage that\nmoves the head in a left-right-left \xe2\x80\x9cNo-No\xe2\x80\x9d\nfashion at a precise angular rate. The\ndevice\xe2\x80\x99s native geo-referenced virtual\nimage is rendered and aligned to overlay a\nreal-world reference. Static and dynamic\nlasers are used for reference to aid the\nalignment. The head is moved and\ntracked dynamically while the high-speed\n(300 fps) video image from the camera\nshows the angular skew of the virtual-toactual image due to the system latency. A\nsnapshot image is captured and the angular difference of the virtual image to the\nactual image is measured with computeraided design software. With the error\nangle measurement and the precision rate\ninformation, the total system latency is calculated. The HeLMR device/method\nquantifies the end-to-end latency of the\nentire system and can be mounted on a\nsynthetic torso for in situ measurements of\nflight simulators or other applications.\nInitial testing was conducted on a custom HMD for a lunar lander application.\nAs with a standard tracking HMD system,\n\nsymbology (e.g., terrain, attitude, guidance) is rendered that is referenced to a\nworld coordinate system. As the head is\nslewed, the symbology is misaligned with\nthe surrounding terrain due to the system\nlatency. This head tracker system uses a\nhybrid combination of optical and inertial\nsensors where both the display and tracker are mounted to clear-lens glasses with a\nhead-borne weight of 4 oz. (113 g). The\ntotal system latency of the lunar HWD system was measured to be 67 milliseconds\nwith detailed lunar terrain rendering, and\n33 milliseconds without terrain. This indicates that the latency is content-dependent in addition to several other factors,\nincluding the display update rate. This system is novel with the ability to non-intrusively quantify system latency and has\nbeen successfully used on several HMD\nsystems. The apparatus combines precision COTS equipment in a unique\narrangement, enabling the measurement\nof a difficult-to-quantify parameter.\nThis work was done by Kevin Shelton,\nRandy Bailey, Trey Arthur, Steve Williams,\nLance Prinzel, Lynda Kramer, Denise Jones,\nand Kyle Ellis of Langley Research Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nPrecise motion control of a robot by\ncontrolling its various robotic manipulators may be organized by the required\nlevel of task specification. The levels\ninclude object-level control, which\ndescribes the ability to control the behavior of an object held in a single or a cooperative grasp of the robot; end-effector\ncontrol, which is control of the various\nmanipulators such as robotic fingers and\nthumbs; and joint-level control.\nCollectively, the various control levels\nachieve the required mobility, dexterity,\nand work task-related functionality.\nThis invention relates to the automatic\ncontrol of a force- or impedance-controlled robot in an operating environment in which a robotic manipulator of\nthe robot may come into unexpected\ndirect physical contact with an object\nand/or an operator within its workspace.\nA method of controlling a robotic\nmanipulator of a force-or impedance-controlled robot within an unstructured\nworkspace includes imposing a saturation\nlimit on a static force applied by the\nmanipulator to its surrounding environment. Should the robotic manipulator\nunexpectedly contact an object in its\nworkspace, the static force applied by the\nmanipulator is limited. Upon contact, the\nrobotic manipulator proceeds with its\nassigned task without \xe2\x80\x9cfighting\xe2\x80\x9d through\nthe object after the object is encountered.\nThe control strategy also may include\nautomatically executing a predetermined\ndynamic reflex upon a threshold contact\nforce with the object. The dynamic reflex\nalleviates any inertial impulse of the contact that is not already addressed by the\nsaturation-limited static force. The\ndynamic reflex can rely on either dynamic modeling or exteroceptive sensing in\norder to detect the contact.\nThe controller provides a control strategy for the robot using an algorithm. The\ncontrol strategy provides a static compliance phase at all times, and may also provide an additional dynamic reflex phase to\nhelp ensure the safe operation of the robot.\nThe controller may be a server or host\nmachine with one or more microprocessors\nor CPUs. Individual control algorithms resident in the controller may be stored in\nROM (read only memory) or other suitable\n\nmemory and automatically executed to\nprovide the control functionality.\nThis work was done by Philip Strawser of\nJohnson Space Center; John Yamokoski and\nBrian Hargrave of Oceaneering Space Systems;\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2014\n\nand Muhammad Abdallah of General Motors\nCorp.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nRefueling spacecraft in space offers\ntremendous benefits for increased payload capacity and reduced launch cost,\nbut the problem of thermal stratification\nin long-term storage tanks presents a key\nchallenge. To meet this challenge, a reliable, compact, lightweight, and efficient\ncryogenic mixing pump was developed\nwith no moving parts. The pump uses an\ninnovative thermodynamic process to\ngenerate fluid jets to promote fluid mixing. This thermodynamic process eliminates moving parts to generate pumping\naction. Inherent to its design, the pump\nis self-priming and can efficiently pump\ntwo-phase fluid. The device will significantly enhance the reliability of pressure\ncontrol systems for storage tanks.\nIn thermal stratification, vaporized hot\nspots develop inside the storage chamber,\nelevating pressure and creating an overpressure hazard. Mechanical mixing to\nde-stratify the fluid and create a uniform\nbulk temperature in microgravity is an\neffective approach for controlling the\n\n50\n\npressure inside a large propellant tank.\nReliable operation at cryogenic temperature is a challenge for pumps because no\nlubricants can be used. Pumping a saturated cryogenic fluid poses several unique\nchallenges for a mechanical pump.\nExisting pumps for cryogenic fluid transfer require a high degree of subcooling at\nthe pump inlet to prevent pump cavitation or de-priming.\nThe thermodynamic process is well\nknown and has been previously used to\ndevelop heat pumps and refrigeration\ndevices. This innovation applies this scientific principle to two-phase room-temperature and cryogenic refrigerants to produce pumping from cyclic pressurization\nand depressurization of the fluid through\na thermal process. The thermodynamic\nprocess enables efficient use of the heat\nabsorbed during the depressurization\nstep to thermally raise the cryogen pressure during the pressurization step, thus\nminimizing the net heat input to the cryogen due to the pumping process.\n\nOn the pressurization process, the\npumping chamber heats the cryogen,\nincreasing pressure within the pump.\nThe increased pressure displaces some\nof the fluid within the pump.\nOn the cooling cycle, the pumping\nchamber cools the cryogen. The vaporized cryogen in the pumping chamber\nthen condenses, creating a suction pressure within the pump that draws in addition fluid. Check valves are used to\nensure that the fluid is one-directional\nfor efficient pumping.\nThis work was done by Weibo Chen and\nAdam Niblick of Creare Incorporated for Glenn\nResearch Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nNASA has requirements for redundant seals to protect human-occupied\ncabin atmospheres, as well as fluid and\ngas systems in space vehicles exposed to\nthe harsh environments. Comparable\nrequirements have been passed down\nto the International Space Station (ISS)\nProgram, and are now levied on the\nOrion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle\n(MPCV).\nThe purpose of this invention is to\nallow independent verification of\nredundant critical seals, which are seals\nthrough which leakage would constitute a catastrophic or critical failure.\nThe problem, in the case of the Orion\nCrew Module (CM) side hatch, is access\nto the seals. In most cases with other\nhatches, access to the seals does not\npresent the same problem because the\narea where the seals are located can easily be bagged with plastic material and\ntape. Bagging the area creates a containment volume for a trace gas around\nthe entire perimeter (inside and outside) that allows ease of seal leakage\nverification using a mass spectrometer\nleak detector (MSLD) per requirements.\nIn the case of the CM side hatch, seals\nare not accessible from either side, and\nare buried deep in the configuration\nwhen the hatch is closed. In the case of\nthe Shuttle Orbiter, side hatch seal leakage verification was performed by pressurizing between the redundant seals,\nand performing a leak decay test. This\nverified that both seals together met the\nleakage requirement; however, it did not\nmeet the requirement to verify each\nredundant seal path independently as\nrequired by the Orion requirement version levied to the program by NASA and\nthus was the driver for this invention.\nThe leak rate specification is much\nsmaller for the Orion vehicle than the\nShuttle Orbiter or any other manned\nvehicle in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s history, and cannot be\nverified accurately by performing a leak\ndecay test.\nIn this invention, a two-beaded silicone rubber molded seal with a metal\nsubstrate retainer is used and the interstitial area between the two seal beads is\nconnected to the leak detector (MSLD)\nvia the test port connector on the CM\nHatch Service Panel. The outer area of\neach seal bulb is shrouded by a helium\n\nenvironment that is contained by the following features designed into the seal\nretainer, which is the core of the invention:\n1. A series of machined through holes\ncalled conductance passageways in the\nmetal seal retainer that are connected\nto one another by conductance grooves\n\nencompassing the entire outer\nperimeter of each seal bulb.\n2. An elastomeric material is permanently adhered to the outer corners\nof the metallic seal retainer.

It is not sufficient to stabilize\nthe kite \xe2\x80\x94 it must be flown in a highspeed crosswind trajectory for power\ngeneration. Additionally, the behavior\nof the kite is highly nonlinear and difficult to model due to flexible structures\nthat assume a shape in response to\naerodynamic loads. In this invention,\nall sensors are kept on the ground,\nallowing the kite to be as light as possible. A fuzzy logic system was chosen to\nperform this control task because a\nreliable model of the kite is unavailable, and the operation of the kite is\nrelatively easy to explain. A commercial, two-line-controlled, ram-air kite\nwas used for developing and testing the\ncontrol system.\nThe system uses measurements of the\ntension in each line, the length of each\nline, and the estimated position of the\nkite from a vision-based tracking system\nas input. It then outputs a commanded\ndifference in length between the lines,\nas well as an average reel rate for both\nlines.\nA predictor-corrector approach is\nused to track the air vehicle. The previously estimated position and velocity are\npropagated to a position estimate.\nDetecting the air vehicle is accomplished using three algorithms: change\nin time of brightness, a change in time\nof hue, and spatial maximum of hue. A\npan-tilt platform is used to keep the air\nvehicle within the camera frame. A fuzzy\nlogic-based controller is used to generate steering and reeling commands for\nthe air vehicle from the position and\nvelocity estimated by the tracking system, as well as the line tension, velocity,\nwind speed, and direction. Groundbased visual tracking is likely to have\nhigher error in localization compared\nto a combination of onboard sensors,\nbut has a significant advantage in\nexpense, complexity, and the weight of\nthe air vehicle. A fuzzy controller has\n\nadvantages in robustness over many\nother control methods.\nThis innovation makes use of\nOpenCV code for some vision processing tasks, Microsoft DirectX and\nXAudio2 code for communicating with\nsome computer hardware, proprietary\nlibraries for communicating with\n\nweather stations, and tension-measuring hardware.\nThis work was done by David North and\nMark Aull for Langley Research Center.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe Lunar Organic Waste Reformer\n(LOWR) is a novel technology to convert organic wastes from human space\nexploration outposts into useful propellant constituents. The LOWR meets\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Trash to Supply Gas (TtSG)\nobjective under the Advanced Exploration Systems Logistics Reduction\nand Repurposing project by integrating\nsteam reformation, methanation, and\nelectrolysis to convert organic waste into\nmethane and oxygen products. At\nreformer temperatures above 700 \xc2\xb0C,\noxygenated steam reacts with organic\nmatter to produce a gas mixture largely\ncomposed of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. After condensing and removing excess water, the\nreformer exhaust gases are fed to a catalytic Sabatier reactor where they are\ncombined with supplemental hydrogen\nat 350 to 500 \xc2\xb0C to produce methane\nand water. The methane product can be\nliquefied for storage.\n\nElectrolysis of water obtained from\nthe reformer and Sabatier reactors provides the supplemental hydrogen needed for methanation, while simultaneously producing oxygen used during\nsteam reforming. Excess oxygen is\nstored as a product. The LOWR system\ndesign requires minimal feed preparation and results in nearly complete\nconversion of feeds to valuable products with minimal consumables, resulting in rapid payback. The thermochemical production of hydrogen in\nthe LOWR reformer leads to significantly reduced electrolysis power\nrequirements compared to other waste\ntreatment methods.\nThe primary application of the LOWR\nis for conversion of organic wastes from\nhuman exploration outposts into valuable propellant components. The\nLOWR reduces risks associated with handling and storing organic wastes while\nrecycling waste constituents into prod-\n\nucts that would otherwise be imported\nfrom Earth.\nAdaptations of the LOWR are suitable\nfor conversion of terrestrial organic\nwastes into fuel for power generation or\ninto feedstock for chemical manufacture. Such usage would reduce effluents\notherwise discharged into the environment while reducing the need for new\nfuels.\nThis work was done by Stacy L. Carrera,\nRobert M.

A simpler system\nwill have many benefits, including reduction of power consumption, complexity,\nvolume, mass, and risk of failure. To\nimplement the Pound-Drever-Hall\n(PDH) technique requires both RF modulation and demodulation electronics,\nincluding an electro-optic modulator, a\nphotoreceiver of sufficient bandwidth to\ndetect the RF modulation fields, demodulation electronics of sufficient bandwidth, and an RF function generator. For\na space mission, this equipment can be\ncostly and power-hungry, in addition to\n\nthe difficulty of being rated to operate in\nthe harsh space environment.\nThe need for laser frequency stabilization will occur in many planned missions\nemploying multiple lasers on multiple\nspacecraft (SIM, LISA, GRACE Follow-on,\nGRACE C). In addition, many laboratory\nmeasurements require laser frequency\nstabilization. This software-based system\nobviates the need for RF components\n(modulator, detector, frequency/function\ngenerator, and associated electronics),\nboth in the laboratory and on a spacecraft, to perform laser frequency stabilization in a digitally controlled system.\n\n54\n\nThe code-based (digital) technique\nwas demonstrated for laser frequency\nstabilization to an optical reference cavity without requiring any RF electronics\nor RF equipment. The process is coded\nusing LabVIEW and employs field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for digital input and output from the photoreceiver and laser, respectively. Instead of\nemploying an external phase-modulator\ndriven by a function generator, the digital code directly modulates the laser\xe2\x80\x99s\npiezoelectric transducer (PZT).\nThis work has shown that high laser\nfrequency stability performance can be\n\nwww.techbriefs.com\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nachieved using optical cavity references,\nwithout the need for the traditional\nPDH RF electronics.

The mercury\nplasma can be generated inside the tube\nwith externally applied RF or microwave\npower. Coils or surface strip electrodes\n\nCustom OEM design\n\ncan be used as a capacitive resonator to\nsustain the plasma. One end of the tube\nis sealed, and the other end of the tube\nis fused with a piece of large-core DUV\nstep-index fiber, where the DUV radiation from the plasma is collected. A gradient-index lens can be manufactured at\nthe output tip of the fiber to deliver the\ncondensed light to the ions. The fiber\noutput can be brought close to the ion\ntrap assembly and coupled through a\nUV window or fiber feedthrough assembly. Alternatively, the miniature plasma\nand delivery assembly could be placed\nentirely in the ion trap vacuum assembly.\nThis work was done by Robert L. Tjoelker,\nEric A.

Coupling these\ndetailed chemical mechanisms with turbulence simulations is\ncompletely impractical because there is no computer powerful\nenough to solve the resulting equations.\nA reduced-kinetics mechanism has been developed that uses\nonly a few important species to duplicate the detailed mechanism at much lower computational cost. The compact reducedkinetics mechanism has been developed for n-C16H34 oxidation\nthat is based on a local full similarity of the detailed mechanism.\nThe reduced mechanism employs only 20 light species and since\nthe light-species reaction rates are more accurately known than\nthose for heavy species, the present reduced mechanism has a\nsmaller relative error than a reduced mechanism employing\nreactions involving heavy species.\nThe model was exercised in the context of a fixed-mass, constant-pressure reactor, and results were obtained over the\nentire range of equivalence-ratio validity of the detailed mechanism at the high pressures encountered in diesel, gas-turbine,\nand HCCI (homogeneous charge compression ignition)\nengines, and at both cold-ignition and hot-ignition temperatures. The results uniformly show excellent accuracy on the\ntemporal evolution of the temperature, the major species mass\nfraction, and the OH mass fraction when compared to those of\nthe detailed mechanism.\nOne advantage of the developed reduced kinetics is that it\nconsists of the same 20 species for n-C7H16, n-C10H22, nC12H26, n-C16H34, and i-C8H18, making it easy to use a reduced\nmodel for mixtures of species composing a practical fuel.\nThis work was done by Josette Bellan, Panagiotis D.

Single-component simulations lack a detailed representation of the complex composition and reaction mechanisms of realistic fuels, which can contain hundreds to thousands of species. Some species may be\nresponsible for fuel ignition, other species may be the initiators\nof soot formation, and yet others may be involved in surface corrosion, all of which demonstrates the importance of being able\nto track the multitude of species.\nA new formulation has previously been developed that mitigates this problem: the fluid equations are deterministic whereas\nthe composition equations are statistic and the composition is\ndescribed statistically in terms of the molar densities. Thus,\ninstead of tracking individual pseudo-components, this previous\nstudy used a statistical model, based on continuous thermodynamics (CT), to represent the composition by means of a probability density function (pdf) having an assumed shape. This\napproach considerably reduced the computational effort, since\nto obtain information of the type needed to predict mixing and\ncombustion, it turns out that transport equations for only a small\nnumber of the lower moments of the pdf must be solved.\nThat previous formulation was valid when solving all scales of\nthe flow, in a type of computation called direct numerical simulation (DNS). However, DNS requires very fine grids and is not\npractical in engineering applications where coarser grids are\nnecessary for computational efficiency. For these engineering\napplications, the formulation called large eddy simulation (LES)\nis used instead of DNS. In LES, the larger scales are computationally resolved and the small scales, called subgrid-scales\n(SGSs), are modeled.

Therefore, it was clear that a more adept\nformulation for the composition equations must be found.\nIn this study, a new set of equations was developed that leads\nto a formulation respecting the LES assumptions. To derive\nthese LES composition equations, instead of the Favre mass density weighted filtering typically used to filter the equations, vapor\npartial molar density filtering is used. In this new LES formulation, the composition pdf moment variables are based on a new\ntype of filter akin to, but different from, Favre filtering. For the\nSGS terms in the pdf composition equations that originate from\nthe advective terms, the predictive capabilities of the dynamic\nSmagorinsky and the approximate-deconvolution-model-issued\nSGS models have been evaluated in an a priori analysis, and it was\nfound that the latter showed superior capabilities compared to\nthe former LES model for the composition equations.\nThis work was done by Josette Bellan of Caltech and Michael R.

Classic machine vision cameras\nmanage inspection tasks and yield management, while network cameras (also\ncalled IP cameras) handle process monitoring and bringing production to a\nstandstill when necessary.\nIn many ways, the two camera breeds\nare actually similar. Industrial GigE cameras typically work with the same Gigabit\nEthernet technology as IP cameras. Both\ncamera types also use the same technical\nprotocols, including TCP/IP and UDP.\nThe similarities, in fact, make the separate technologies \xe2\x80\x94 both engineered\nfrom the ground up to serve different\npurposes \xe2\x80\x94 easy to combine. Customers\nnow want to implement both camera\ntypes to fit their specific applications,\nand new products are being developed\nthat combine the best features from the\nIP and machine vision devices.\n\nwidths and optimal image quality as part\nof closed image processing systems.\nWhile network cameras compress the\nimage data down to a fraction of its original data volume, in an effort to reduce\nthe bandwidth required to transport\nthat data, industrial cameras deliver raw\nimages. The unprocessed images allow\nusers to review even the most minute of\ndetails, as is necessary for quality inspections or detail measurements. If image\ndata is missing and the error occurs precisely in that area, leading to a false positive by the inspection system, then the\nsystem has failed in its mission.\nIP cameras are also capable of multistreaming, meaning the camera sends\nmultiple streams in different compression formats, such as H.264, MPEG-4,\nand MJPEG. Each end device then ac-\n\ncesses a suitable stream. An operator, for\nexample, can call up a high-resolution\nMJPEG stream offering strong detailing\non his or her monitor, even while a\nspace-saving version in the H.264 format\nis submitted for archiving. Machine vision cameras work with post-processed\ndata that has already been evaluated,\nsuch as production statistics. The devices\nalso optimize equipment performance\nand adapt the equipment to eliminate\nrecurrent errors. In general, the images\nare only stored after inspection.\nReal-time capability, another functional distinction between the two technologies, means that image capture starts\nimmediately after a trigger signal has\nbeen sent to the camera. Image data must\nbe acquired, transmitted, and evaluated\nwithin a set timeframe. The requirements\n\nIP vs. Classic Industrial Cameras\nThe core differences between a classic\nmachine vision camera and a network\n(or IP) device come in the areas of\nimage data compression, multi-streaming, and real-time compatibility.\nIP cameras are specially designed to\nwork with low bandwidths to ensure that\nthey can fit seamlessly in existing networks without overloading them. The\ncamera is configured via a PC on the\nnetwork to send a compressed video\nstream, such as MPEG-4, MJPEG, or\nH.264. The IP camera primarily provides a strong visual impression on the\noperator\xe2\x80\x99s monitor.\nIndustrial cameras, by contrast, are\nengineered to work with large band-\n\nIndustrial camera and IP camera systems are typically found within the same production environment,\ncarrying out their own specific tasks.\n\n64\n\nwww.techbriefs.com\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nImaging Technology, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nLower production costs through our unique OEM design & feature\nenhancement services.

For industrial cameras, realtime images are a prerequisite. When inspecting components in a production\nprocess, for example, the components\nare transported on the conveyor belts at\nhigh speed. For a precise inspection, the\ncamera must acquire the images as\nquickly as the components are being\ntransported. Timing this precisely requires low latency: a small time delay between receiving the trigger signal and acquiring the image. Further, the time\ndelay must not vary; no jitter can affect\nthe moments of image acquisition. For an\napplication with high image rates (e.g.\n300 images per second), the required latency times can only be microseconds.\nSimilar requirements also exist outside\nof the factory, especially in traffic applications. In speed control systems, the camera activity must be synchronized with\nother system components, such as illumination devices. Many classic IP cameras\nare not real-time capable. In typical surveillance situations, such as monitoring\nthe activity on a banking floor, the user\nneeds an automatically captured, continuous stream of images without the need\nto trigger a camera. If a camera is set for\na frame rate of 30 frames (images) per\nsecond, it will internally generate the signals required to initiate an image capture every 1/30th of a second. In some\nother situations, however, it would be desirable to be able to trigger an image capture at a specific point in time. For example, in a traffic control situation the user\nmay want to trigger an image acquisition\nimmediately after a car passes a sensor\non a highway.\n\nConverging the Cameras\nDespite the different technologies\nand objectives, many applications are\ncompatible with both types of cameras.\nThere are now even solutions that operate IP cameras and GigE industrial cameras in one single Ethernet-based system\nusing the same software.\nThe setup is already daily practice in\nthe paper industry. Similar concepts are\nalso in place for steel and foil production.\nEquipment used for these tasks typically\ninvolves numerous sequential process\nsteps spread out over a physical space, including multiple sub-systems that need to\npass products like paper webs to one another. IP cameras monitor the individual\nprocess steps and the transfer of the\nproduct to the next machine. The network devices ensure optimal interplay be-\n\nProduction robots in the automotive industry often combine both camera types: small and light industrial cameras inside the robots, and network cameras for process control.\n\ntween all equipment systems, identify\nthreats and sources of disruption, initiate\na production stop where necessary, and\ngenerally help to optimize the machine\nconfigurations. If, for example, problems\ntend to arise in a given location, then the\nengineers will know to give that area a\ncloser look. At the same time, classic cameras operate within the individual inline\nsystems and test for quality, completeness,\nor dimensions.\nAdditionally, in the world of robotics,\nmachine vision systems have long been\nused to \xe2\x80\x9cteach robots to see.\xe2\x80\x9d After all,\nrobot arms can only perform their highprecision gripping and positioning maneuvers once cameras and image processing tell them precisely where to move.\nSmall, light industrial cameras, like the\nBasler ace, are typically used in robots.\nThe devices are ideal for \xe2\x80\x9cpick and place\xe2\x80\x9d\napplications: gripping, mounting, and positioning tasks during computer chip assembly. Industrial cameras are also\nneeded for measurement and quality controls of the various product characteristics\nbetween and during all production steps.\nSafety during the production process\nis a prime concern for robotics applica-\n\n66\n\ntions. Previously, barriers were built to\nprevent workers from entering into the\ndanger zones containing the rotating robots. The structures were expensive,\ncumbersome, and inflexible. IP cameras\nhave changed the situation fundamentally. The network technologies can now\nbe placed around the robots to create a\n\xe2\x80\x9cvirtual cage\xe2\x80\x9d based on markings on the\nfloor. The camera monitors those\nmarked zones and is authorized to stop\nthe machine if material, or an employee,\nenters into the robot\xe2\x80\x99s working area.\nIn daily use, the boundaries between\nthe two camera technologies are largely\nbecoming blurred. IP cameras, which\nclassically have served in the monitoring\nfield, are more and more frequently\nbeing used in industrial contexts to support process monitoring and production\nworkflows. Camera manufacturers are\nalso offering customers a range of cameras and accessories to ensure an optimal interplay between all components.\nThis article was written by Eva Tischendorf, Senior Communications Specialist at\nBasler AG (Ahrensburg, Germany).

However, when the term\nsmart camera is mentioned, a wide variety of ideas still come to mind among individuals because there is no widespread\nagreement upon the definition of what a\nsmart camera technically is. It is generally agreed upon that the basics of a\nsmart camera include not only the image\nsensor, but also some type of processing\nchip: a CPU, DSP, FPGA, or other type of\nprocessing device (see Figure 1).\nToday, however, even an off-the-shelf,\npoint & shoot digital camera has some\ntype of built-in image processing to remove the red eye effect, conduct facial\nrecognition, apply a filter, or perform\nanother type of image processing. So, if\nthe inclusion of a processor along with\nan image sensor is not the defining attribute of a smart camera, what makes a\nsmart camera \xe2\x80\x9csmart?\xe2\x80\x9d The key lies in\nthe output.\nUnlike most cameras, the primary output of a smart camera is not an image,\nbut a decision or information. Since the\nimage processing or machine vision algorithm is done directly on the smart camera, the image does not need to be passed\nonto a PC or another device. Instead, the\nresult of the processing can be passed directly to an operator or another device in\nthe system. For example, a smart camera\nmay be selected for use in an in-line inspection system for a manufacturing line.\nThe output of the smart camera could be\na pass/fail report over a network to a\ndatabase, a digital signal triggering a sorting system, or a serial command to a programmable logic controller (PLC).\nA smart camera is a decision maker.\nStill, if you conduct an internet search\nfor a smart camera, you will receive a\nlarge variety of results with very different features and appearance options.\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s review some essential properties\nof smart cameras and how they have\nprogressed:\n\nS\n\nFigure 1. A smart camera typically includes an image sensor, processor, and some type of I/O. Other\nfeatures can be added, such as direct drive lighting control, industrial I/O, and a display port.\n\nFigure 2.

A 1 MHz smart camera 15 years ago would have been four times the size and\ncost of a >1 GHz smart camera of today. Many may be surprised when they realize the processing performance on\nsome smart cameras rival what can be done on PC-based systems. An in-line inspection application, for example, that\nrequires barcode reading, multiple geometric pattern\nmatching, color analysis, line detection, and particle analysis can be done with a yield of over 25 parts per second. Additionally, this type of application can include triggering,\nlighting control, communication with other devices, and\ndisplay all within the same compact package. Smart cameras come with a range of available processors, including\nDSPs, PowerPC-class, and Atom-class. There are also options with a mixed offering, such as a CPU with a DSP coprocessor for certain algorithms.\n\nSize\n\nFigure 3. Smart cameras like the NI 1772 camera from National Instruments\nhave high IP ratings for protection against environmental exposures like\ndust and water. Higher IP ratings are beneficial for applications in harsh environments, including outdoor monitoring and industrial vision inspection.\n\nMachine Vision Problem Solver:\nThe Cyton-CXP\n\nOne benefit to using a smart camera is that multiple components of a vision system are integrated into a single package, resulting in a small size and the potential to save a lot of\nspace. The top-of-the-line, high-performance smart cameras\nkeep getting faster without having to affect size, but the devices are also heading further into the low-end market. Reducing the functionality from an all-purpose smart camera to one\nthat is designed for specific algorithms, such as barcode verification/reading and optical character recognition (OCR), reduces the number of components and complexity.

That is, the software should scale with application requirements and future projects.\nSensor and processor technologies are advancing rapidly, so\nthe best-case scenario takes place when the smart camera model\nImaging Technology, June 2014\n\nFree Info at http://info.hotims.com/49746-759\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\n70\n\nOf course, a smart camera is still a camera and must acquire\nimages. Both CMOS and CCD sensors can be found in smart\ncameras with resolutions of 5 MP, available in both color and\nmonochrome. Smart cameras are not just limited to area scan\nanymore. Line-scan smart cameras are also available with frequencies over 10 kHz. While smart cameras do not cover the\nfull range of options as normal cameras, they feature some of\nthe most popular sensors.\nA key downfall with smart cameras, however, comes when an\napplication requires multiple image sensors connected to the\nsame processing unit. One way to solve the problem is to synchronize multiple smart cameras, but that can add significant\ncost and complexity. In these cases, it is best to explore alternatives, such as compact vision systems or PC-based systems.\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\nand software are well integrated, but not\nexclusive to each other. As a result, if you\nchange smart camera models to a new\nversion or need to move to a different\nhardware platform, such as a PC or operating system, a complete rewrite of the\napplication or IP should not be required.\nThe operating system running on the\ncamera itself can also be a critical factor\nas Windows-based smart cameras connected to a plant network may fall under\nIT restrictions (see Figure 2).\n\nRuggedness\nThe level of ruggedness required is\ndependent upon the environment in\nwhich the smart camera is to be deployed. It is important to note that many\napplications take place in fairly harsh environments. In food inspection applications, for example, the cleaning process\nwashes all parts on the line, including\nthe camera. Smart cameras are available\nwith an IP rating of at least 67, which offers total protection against dust and\nsubmersion in water up to 1 m deep (see\nFigure 3).\n\nIntegration\nThose who have completed a vision\napplication know that vision is often\npart of a much larger system. Since the\nprimary output of a smart camera is a\ndecision, result, or some other information beyond an image, most smart cameras have built-in I/O to communicate\nor control other devices in the system.\nWith industrial automation, the smart\ncamera may need to control actuators to\nsort products; communicate inspection\nresults to a robot controller, PLC, or\n\nFigure 4. Since the primary output of a smart\ncamera is a decision or some type of signal other\nthan an image, many smart cameras include integrated I/O and communication ports: lighting,\ndigital I/O, serial, Ethernet, and USB buses, as\nwell as display ports for user interfaces.\n\nInspection\nSystem?\n\nFREE\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED IS\nAVAI BLE IN OUR NEW\n\nDecision Making\n\nIMAGING OPTICS\nCATALOG\n\nWith the capabilities of today\xe2\x80\x99s smart\ncameras, the adoption of these devices\ncontinues to grow, and newer technologies are being integrated that could help\naccelerate the growth. The devices, for\nexample, are moving into the 3D vision\nspace by providing solutions with multiple image sensors integrated into stereoscope or laser triangulation packages.\nThese days, smart cameras can come in\nall shapes, sizes, and performance levels,\nbut there is still one attribute that still\ndefines them as smart cameras: the ability to perform image processing and\nmake decisions directly on the camera.\nIt is the decision making that makes a\ncamera smart, and with the potential\ncost savings, ease of integration, and increasing performance, smart cameras\nare a cutting-edge option for many vision applications.\nThis article was written by Carlton Heard,\nProduct Engineer \xe2\x80\x93 Vision Hardware and\nSoftware, at National Instruments (Austin,\nTX).

With USB and display\nports, smart cameras can completely replace PC vision systems where an operator interface is required; the parts are\nintegrated in a single device.\nOften, for scientific imaging applications, the vision must integrate with motion stages, data acquisition systems, microscopes, specialized optics, and\nadvanced triggering. As a result, many\nsmart cameras today include I/O such as\nindustrial digital inputs and outputs, encoder inputs for image synchronization,\nand communication ports.\nModels are also available with built-in\nlighting, however, an integrated light cannot be independently positioned, and the\nfeature is useless if a backlight is used.\nBuilt-in light controllers, an available alternative, can modify illumination directly\nfrom the smart camera. To effectively\ncommunicate to other devices, more and\nmore industrial communication protocols, including DeviceNet, EthernetIP,\nand serial, are also being supported natively in smart cameras. It is therefore critical to understand how the smart camera\nwill best integrate into an overall system\n(see Figure 4).\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nGET YOUR COPY TODAY!\n\n+1-856-547-3488\nwww.edmundoptics.com/eo-imaging\n\nFree Info at http://info.hotims.com/49746-760\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nIndoor/Outdoor Cameras Improve School\nDistrict\xe2\x80\x99s Security\nin\nTexas,\nL ocatedhas Texarkana,School LibertyEylau Independent\nDistrict\n(LEISD)\nbeen serving communities\nsince 1886. Today, the district has more\nthan 2,700 K-12 students across six\nschools, including a high school, a middle-intermediate school, an elementary\nschool, a primary school, a pre-K center,\nand a School of Success.\nWith safety being a core part of LEISD\xe2\x80\x99s\nvision statement, it is no surprise that district leaders strive to do all they can to ensure the safest school environments possible. In early 2013, however, the district\nrealized that it needed to make some serious improvements to its security infrastructure. According to Matt Fry, LEISD\nMedia Coordinator, 40 analog cameras\nwere being used district-wide, and some\ncampuses were not covered at all.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cameras offered some basic coverage outside, but not a lot inside,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cWorse yet, they had very poor picture quality and big lag time lapses between frames, so we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really use\nthe video for much. We knew it was time\nto update to a more modern, digital solution with a lot higher resolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFry took these challenges to the TCEA\n(Texas Computer Education Association)\nconference in February 2013, where he\nmet security networking experts from DLink, a developer and manufacturer of\nnetwork solutions and IP surveillance,\nwho proposed a follow-up meeting to discuss the district\xe2\x80\x99s specific needs.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe also wanted a system that was scalable so we could take it district-wide,\nplus provide the ability to do remote\nmonitoring,\xe2\x80\x9d Fry said.\n\nThe Solution\nShortly after the conference, the team\nbrought in a local technology integrator,\nCMC Network Solutions, and met on site\nto examine the district\xe2\x80\x99s existing network infrastructure and physical layout,\nwhile discussing its specific IP surveillance requirements.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmong other things, the district\nneeded the ability to archive video data\nfor up to 30 days, so they could review\nincidents after the fact, if necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLiberty-Eylau Independent School District utilizes D-Link switches (above) in conjunction with an array\nof indoor/outdoor cameras and SAN arrays for its surveillance technology.\n\n72\n\nwww.techbriefs.com\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nImaging Technology, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nsaid Scott Broekemeier, Principal at the Plano, TX-based\nCMC Network Solutions. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the site survey, we created a\ncustom design that provided the performance, resolution,\nand coverage they desired.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHaving reviewed bids from multiple providers, LEISD ultimately chose the technology from D-Link: IP cameras, switches,\nvideo storage, and access control. The district purchased a complete 240-camera security system that included a mix of D-Link\nIP indoor and outdoor cameras (most offering Full HD 2\nmegapixel resolution), as well as D-Link switches, SAN Storage,\nVideo Insight video management software, dedicated VMS\nservers, and access control products for tighter security at doors\nand entry points. D-Link Indoor Day and Night Dome IP Cameras also offer integrated mechanical IR filters and infrared\nLEDs to allow the viewing and recording of video, even in complete darkness.\nCMC Network Solutions hosts all of the traffic on a separate\nVPN network, which does not conflict with the district\xe2\x80\x99s existing data network traffic. Fortunately, CMC was able to use\nsome of LEISD\xe2\x80\x99s existing fiber backbone, which helped keep\ncosts down.\n\nLine-Scan Camera\nThe 3DPIXA 3D line scan color camera from Chromasens (Burlington,\nMA) employs factory-calibrated stereo\nengineering. To output both color images and 3D altitude data in real time,\nthe Chromasens 3DPIXA simultaneously captures two images of the same\nobject. Height and shape are calculated\nusing special algorithms running on\nthe GPU.\nThe cameras are available in two different principle designs: a compact system with a resolution of 15\xce\xbcm / 30 \xce\xbcm and a line frequency of\nup to 22 kHz, and the 3DPIXA dual system with a resolution of e.g.\n10\xce\xbcm and a line frequency of up to 50 kHz. The latter variant inspects\nat speeds of up to 500mm/s, at 10 \xce\xbcm optical resolution.\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-140\n\nFrame Grabbers\nThe PIXCI\xc2\xae EB1mini frame grabber\nfrom EPIX (Buffalo Grove, IL) captures\nfrom any base Camera Link device.

The high-definition IP cameras provide higher-quality\nvideo images and simplified remote monitoring \xe2\x80\x94 even from\nmobile devices. Additionally, the new solution is making life\neasier for the local police department.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOfficers really like\nthe mobile capability,\nwhere they can access\nvideo from their\nphones or tablets and\nsee what\xe2\x80\x99s happening\non campus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fry.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne time an officer\ncalled because he noticed lights on in the\ngym after hours.\nEven though I was\nout of town, I was\nable to pull up video\nimages on my smartThe Liberty-Eylau Independent School District\nphone and see for\ncurrently uses over 100 DCS-6113 cameras\nfrom D-Link, shown here.\nmyself, so I could address the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThanks to the solution\xe2\x80\x99s centralized management, each campus can keep a watchful eye on its own facility, while administrators at the district office can view video from all six campuses at the same time. The district is already planning to add\na few more to provide extra visibility and more zoom on a few\nadditional areas like entry gates.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was a huge purchase for our school district; and since\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re using taxpayer dollars, we take that very seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fry.\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-153.\n\nImaging Technology, June 2014\n\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-141\n\nX-Ray CCD Cameras\nAndor Technology (Belfast, UK) has announced the iKon-M SY and Newton SY series of CCD cameras.

This commercialization has contributed to the development\nof products and services in the fields of health and medicine, consumer goods,\ntransportation, public safety, computer technology, and environmental resources.\n\nHome Air Purifiers Eradicate Harmful Pathogens\nAn air scrubber used in space station plant growth helps you breathe easier at home.\n\nI\n\nn the 1990s, NASA scientists were\nthinking of what astronauts would\nneed to survive long-term missions to\nthe Moon and other planets. One\nimportant requirement was a dependable source of food, which could be\naccomplished by astronauts growing\ntheir own produce in space-age greenhouses. But cultivating crops in a sealedoff environment results in the buildup\nof an undesirable gas called ethylene.\nPlants release the odorless, colorless\nfume into the air, which has the unfortunate effect of accelerating decay, hastening the wilting of flowers and the ripening of fruits and vegetables.\n\nMizuna lettuce growing aboard the International\nSpace Station. Ethylene scrubbers are used to\nremove the gas from the air, keeping vegetables\nfresh in space.\n\nTo address the problem, Marshall\nSpace Flight Center\xe2\x80\x99s Space Product\nDevelopment Program funded the\nWisconsin Center for Space Automation\nand Robotics at the University of\nWisconsin to develop plant growth chambers that included an ethylene reduction\n\ndevice. In this \xe2\x80\x9cscrubber,\xe2\x80\x9d air is drawn\ninto tubes coated with thin layers of titanium dioxide (TiO2). When an ultraviolet (UV) light source located in the tubes\nstrikes the TiO2, the ethylene gets converted to water and carbon dioxide, both\nof which are beneficial for plants.\nThe ethylene scrubber was first used\nin 1995 aboard a Space Shuttle\nColumbia mission, successfully preserving a crop of potato seedlings. Updated\nversions of the device were subsequently\nflown on several missions to the\nInternational Space Station.\nWhile NASA\xe2\x80\x99s main objective was to\nget rid of ethylene, the scrubbers were\ncapable of purging all kinds of unwanted organic particles from the air.\nRecognizing its powerful air purification\nabilities, KES Science & Technology\n(Kennesaw, GA) licensed the technology\nfrom the University of Wisconsin. The\ncompany then partnered with Akida\nHoldings (Jacksonville, FL), which marketed the technology as Airocide.\nIn 2013, Airocide finally found its way\ninto people\xe2\x80\x99s homes when Akida\nHoldings adapted the technology for\nhome use by developing an eye-catching\nportable unit with enough power to\npurge an entire room of pathogens. The\nAirocide unit is the only air purifier that\ncompletely destroys airborne bacteria,\nmold, fungi, mycotoxins, viruses, volatile\norganic compounds, and odors. Grocery\nstores and produce distribution facilities\nnow use it, in addition to a host of wineries, distilleries, and floral businesses. The\ndevice has also found its way into refrigerators used for both homes and for dis-\n\n80\n\nThe Airocide home unit can be placed on a flat\nsurface, hung on a wall, or mounted to a floor\nstand.\n\ntributing food aid to remote towns. In\nhospitals and clinics, Airocide\xe2\x80\x99s germkilling properties are used to purge the\nair of harmful bacteria.\nThe home Airocide unit has a sleek,\nglossy, rectangular body and can either\nbe mounted on a floor stand or hung on\na wall. Airocide works differently from\nHigh-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA)\nfilters, which are designed to capture\nparticles that are 0.3 microns across and\nlarger. Airocide is simple to operate \xe2\x80\x94\njust plug it into an outlet, turn it on, and\nforget about it. The only upkeep\nrequired is replacing the reaction chamber, which houses the UV light source,\nevery 12-14 months. There are high- and\nlow-intensity modes, as well as automatic, which alternates from high in the day\nto low at night.\nAccording to users, the product helps\nrelieve symptoms associated with asthma, allergies, and sinus problems.\nVisit http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2013/\ncg_4.html for the full story.\n\nwww.techbriefs.com\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\n" Access to the right technology is key\nto creating an innovative design.\n\nIt\'s great to be an engineer."\n\nENGINEERS\n\nSTART HERE.\nResearch.

When a higher frequency is needed\nand the generator can\xe2\x80\x99t output all of the points in waveform memory, it will skip\nover some points. The higher the frequency, the more points are skipped\xe2\x80\x94and\nthe less the output resembles the signal you expect to see.\nMoreover, DDS generators use internal algorithms to determine which points are\nskipped. These algorithms put a priority the phase of a signal, which results in\nsignals that don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily skip the same samples in every cycle.\n\nTo learn how to overcome your function generator challenges with\nTrueform technology, view videos and download free measurement briefs,\nvisit www.agilent.com/\xef\xac\x81nd/trueformTC\nFigure 1:\nSignals at the same\nfrequency created by a\nDDS generator (upper\ntrace) and a Trueform\ngenerator (lower trace)\n\nFigure 2:\nThis 40 MHz sine wave\nfrom the 33600A shows\nless than 800 femtoseconds of jitter.\n\nTrue signals with Trueform technology\nTrueform waveform generators use proprietary technology that allows waveforms\nto be expressed with the same shape, regardless of frequency. Designers working\nwith complex waveforms can use Trueform generators to generate signals with\ncomplex modulation and abnormalities. Digital waveforms with transients and\npulses can be reproduced with the same characteristics every time.\nFigure 1 shows an example of the dramatic differences between DDS and\nTrueform waveforms. Note the three small peaks in the Trueform signal and compare the DDS output; these signal characteristics are distorted or missing entirely.\nDramatic reduction in jitter\nAnother key bene\xef\xac\x81t of the Trueform architecture is extremely low jitter.\nCycle-to-cycle jitter for the new Agilent 33600A Series, for example, is speci\xef\xac\x81ed\nat less than 1 ps for all waveforms, including arbitrary, sine, and square waves.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s about 200 times less jitter than DDS-based generators (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 3:\nA DDS generator\n(upper trace) was\nunable to output all\nseven aberrations in\nthis 2 MHz arbitrary\nwaveform.\n\nMissing the point\nFigure 3 illustrates the problem of missing points in DDS outputs. At 1 kHz, both\ngenerators were able to create an accurate waveform with all seven aberrations, but when the frequency was dialed up to 2 MHz, three of the seven signal\nfeatures disappeared from the DDS output. At even higher frequencies, the aberrations can be become intermittent or distorted\xe2\x80\x94or all of them can disappear\ncompletely.\n\nAgilent\n\nAgilent and our network of Agilent Authorized Distributors\nhave teamed up to provide fast, easy access to the\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s largest selection of off-the-shelf T&M\ninstruments.

Electric motors,\ndrive electronics, and mechanisms are\nessential elements of aircraft actuation\nin MEAs that incorporate ElectroMagnetic Actuators (EMAs). High-temperature environments experienced in\naircraft applications place demands on\nactuator components, materials, and\ninsulation systems that dictate the use of\nnew technologies and materials.\nHigh Temperature Electromagnetic\nActuator (HTEMA) options for hightemperature aircraft environments\ninclude appropriate motor types, drive\nand control electronics, mechanisms,\nmaterials, and construction methods.\nThese options are evaluated to identify\ncandidates that meet the challenges of\ntomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s MEA actuators.\nEfforts to design, build, and test a prototype demonstrating a high-temperature, high-reliability class of all-electromagnetic actuator design with minimal/no heat load on aircraft cooling systems are ongoing. Size and weight goals\nare consistent with the aircraft engine\nlimits. The key technical aspects being\naddressed include operation in the high\ntemperature and vibration environment, actuator force, power, weight, size,\nefficiency, speed, stroke, mechanical\nrobustness and reliability, lifecycle cost,\nfailure modes and effects, and maintenance predictions.\nEngine nozzle actuation is presently\naccomplished using fuel as a hydraulic\nworking fluid (fueldraulic actuation) for\nthe current-generation engine actuators. While the nozzle actuation has a\nlow duty cycle, the heat generated is continuous and presents a significant load\non the ircraft/engine thermal management system.\nAn electrically driven actuator can\nreduce the heat load of the aircraft. The\n\nFigure 1: HTEMA actuator package (left) and interior view.\n\npresent engine fueldraulic actuators and\naircraft fuel systems are highly interrelated, leading to a challenging thermal management problem that has an\nimpact on aircraft performance.\nElimination of this fuel heat load\nreduces the fuel system\xe2\x80\x99s thermal issues.\nHigh-temperature,\nelectromagnetic\nactuator component solutions that meet\nthe technology challenges and performance requirements for an actuator system operating engine nozzle actuation\nhave been identified.\n\nConvergent Nozzle Actuation\nThe design and development of\nHTEMA technology for a Convergent\nNozzle Actuation System (CNAS) actuator has been completed. The CNAS is\nthe first critical application of the\nHTEMA technology, providing the\npower to position the nozzle as required\nfor the pilot-selected engine Power Level\nAngle (PLA). The CNAS actuators are\nmounted to the aft end of the engine.\nCurrent fueldraulic actuators for the\nCNAS are limited by the actuator O-ring\nmaterial. In the CNAS application, fluid\ntemperature limits approach 325 \xc2\xb0F and\n\nIIa\n\nwww.techbriefs.com/motion\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nseal temperature limits approach 400 \xc2\xb0F.\nThe current engine actuators are able to\noperate in a temperature environment\napproaching 325 \xc2\xb0F continually and up\nto 560 \xc2\xb0F for transients of 10 seconds by\nusing the hydraulic fluid (fuel) as a\nmeans of cooling.\nThe CNAS actuators have a linear\nstroke of 4", a combined stall load (for 4\nactuators) of 42,000 lbf, and weigh\nabout 52 lbm (actuation system hardware including routing).

This dictates a gap area of at least\n2.1 \xc3\x97 103 square inches is needed to generate the required force. Based on the 5\npsi curve, an actuator with an 18" gap\ndiameter has roughly a 2\' outer diameter\nand 3\' length. An approximate actuator\nweight would be greater than 1,000\npounds, which is clearly unacceptable.\nGiven the envelope requirement of\n11 \xc3\x97 2.5 \xc3\x97 6.5", an 11"-long machine\nwould have over a 60" diameter, an unacceptable result.\nTherefore, the CNAS application\nrequires mechanical advantage to\ndecrease the required electromagnetic\nactuator force and size, while increasing\nspeed. The Navy investigated electromagnetic actuator replacements for\nhydraulic cylinders and found planetary\nroller screws to be a good candidate for\nrotor-to-linear conversion and mechanical advantage. Typical COTS roller\nscrew ratings indicate a screw diameter\nin the 30- to 48-mm (~1.2 to 1.9") range\nis appropriate.\nInclusion of a single-pass, 5 to 1 planetary gear between the planetary roller\nscrew and motor improves this situation. COTS planetary gears show a significant performance advantage for a\n\nsmall weight (<2.8 lbs). Issues with dry\nlubrication, life, and seals must be\naddressed in a custom detailed design\nfor this high-temperature application.\nHowever, this information is sufficient\nfor trade studies. Assuming a ~3:1\nlength-to-diameter ratio, the motor\nweight is less than 12 pounds.\nHarmonic drives were considered for\nhigher gear ratios in smaller packages.\nHowever, concerns about the ability to\nback-drive the unit in some failure\nmodes prevented inclusion in the baseline design. Magnetic gearing is also an\noption but concerns about permanent\nmagnet (PM) demagnetization during\nflux reversals at high temperature were\nconsidered high risk.\nCare must be exercised in the lead\nscrew and gear ratio selection if the\nactuator must be back-driven with the\npower off. There is a critical angle in\nlead screws where the unit will act as a\nfriction lock at and below the critical\nvalue. Similarly, the gearing will multiply any drag and cogging torques present in the motor, which can also inhibit\nthe ability to back-drive an actuator. It is\nimportant to keep this in mind during\ndetailed trades.\n\nBaseline Actuator Concept\nThe system design includes the following key components and technologies:\nroller screw, planetary gearing, hightemperature coatings, high-temperature\nmotor materials and insulation system,\nhigh-temperature power electronics,\nand sensors.\nSeveral motor types have been considered with high efficiency and minimal weight and volume. These include\nsurface mount PM, Halbach Array PM,\nburied magnet PM, and hybrid stepper.\nOthers that do not require PMs\ninclude wound rotor DC (brush and\nbrushless), variable or switched reluctance (VR or SR) machines, and squirrel cage induction motors. Trades have\nidentified brushless DC PM and SR\nmachines are of primary interest. Both\nmotors can use sensorless commutation methods. A VR resolver can be\nincorporated in the design if required\nfor control feedback.\nVR motors are robust with simple\nwindings, facilitating application of\nhigh-temperature insulation. Because\nVR motors have no permanent magnets,\nthey do not generate a back Electro\nMotive Force (EMF) voltage when\n\nFigure 2: HTEMA representation in Simulink.\n\n2a\n\nwww.techbriefs.com/motion\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nMotion Control and Automation Technology, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nFree Info at http://info.hotims.com/49\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nHigh-Temperature Actuators\nunpowered, which may be advantageous\nin some failure modes.\nThe PM motor design includes a band\nto contain the surface-mount PMs. VR\nmachines do not require such containment requirements, but have quite small\nmechanical gaps that must be maintained over temperature and life. Both\nmachines can be back-driven, with VR\nmachines having an advantage of no\nback EMF generated when unpowered.\nThis may be an advantage in failure\nmodes and effects analyses (FMEA).\nGiven the motor is used in an aircraft\n\napplication, high-saturation flux density\nlamination material is highly desirable.\nBrushless DC PM motors provide\nexcellent efficiency with high bandwidth\nfor servo applications. Brushless commutation is appropriate for life, reliability, and maintenance issues. High motor\npole count is a big factor in minimizing\nweight. Maximum slew rate, speed,\nswitching speed, and/or geometry will\nbe the limiting factor, but the higher the\nnumber of poles, the better.\nMechanical gears are a mature technology with a long and rich history.\n\nMachined Springs\n& Flexible Couplings\n\nTradition + Innovation = Solutions\n\nFollowing 55 successful years in business, Helical Products\nCompany, Inc. and its engineering team have developed\nextensive experience designing and manufacturing innovative\nproducts for controlling mechanical movements, specializing in\n\ncustomers served, why not let Helical spring into action and start\ncoupling your dreams with reality today!\n\nor a\natalog\nfree c s today at:\nFor a\nail u\nm\nle, em heli-cal.co\nsamp\nst@\nque\nfreere\n\nMotion Control and Automation Technology, June 2014\n\nFree Info at http://info.hotims.com/49746-772\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\n4a\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\nWhen properly designed, applied, and\nmaintained, they can provide long, failure-free performance. In addition, cost\nand manpower limitations are pushing\nhardware toward more robust, no-maintenance technologies.\nPlanetary gears were selected in the\nbaseline design for their power-dense,\nhigh-torque transmission capacity and\nform factor. A COTS gearhead was identified with 5:1 gear ratio in a single pass.\nModifications to the COTS gearhead\nwith a 98- 95% efficiency for a single pass\nand 150,000 to 200,000 hours of life at\nroom temperature to meet the hightemperature environment are anticipated. Flex spline or harmonic drives can\nalso be used if failure modes and effects\nanalyses show their inability to be backdriven is not an issue.\nA simulation study of HTEMA was performed based on flow-down requirements. The simulation tool used was\nSimulink\ntogether\nwith\nits\nSimPowerSystems (SPS) toolbox from\nMathWorks. Instead of using SPS library\nmodels, custom models were created for\nthe permanent magnet synchronous\nmotor, the motor drive, and some of the\nmechanical elements. The main reason\nfor creating custom models is that the\nexisting SPS models do not provide the\nflexibility needed for detailed study of\nthe HTEMA.\nAs shown in Figure 2, a nested controller structure is used to provide the\nservo performance. The outermost control loop is the position controller,\nwhich generates the motor speed reference used by the speed controller.

A separate\nmetrology system can be used to\nincrease the accuracy of knowledge of\nthe probe position and orientation.\nThe probe carrier, at the junction of\nthe suspension cables, has actuators to\nalter the probe orientation. Power is\nsupplied by passing current through\nthe suspension cables, or by battery\npower on the probe carrier. Multiple\nsets of cables and probe platforms can\nbe used to simulate multiple orbiting\nassets. The probe can be a transmitter,\na receiver, or both, and can be at any\nfrequency that is needed for the test\nscenario. A calibration reference, for\nphase and/or amplitude, can be transmitted to the probe carrier by RF, optical, or wired means.\nThis technology has been used to \xe2\x80\x9cfly\xe2\x80\x9d\na video or film camera over a football\nstadium, but has never been used for\nantenna measurements or simulation of\nmoving sources over an area. For lowprecision applications, the lengths of the\ncables can be mathematically transformed into the position of the probe.\nAn external tracking system, using optical or RF means, can be used for higher\nprecision. Closed loop control can be\nimplemented from the tracking system\nto the winch controllers to allow very\nprecise and repeatable control of the\nposition of the probe.\nThe cables can be made of any reasonably strong material, although materials with low elasticity (e.g. Kevlar or\nSpectra) are preferred for precision\npositioning. Steel cables have been used\nin the commercial flying camera applications. However, a non-conductive\ncable has significant advantages for the\nantenna and RF application, since it\ndoes not perturb the RF fields as much\nas a conductive cable; however, with\nsuitable probe design, a conductive\ncable may be acceptable. Non-conductive cables improve safety, since the\ncables won\xe2\x80\x99t conduct dangerous voltages or currents, as from an inadvertent\ncontact with some energized conductor\nor lightning.\nPower for the probe is provided either\nby batteries, solar cells, or other means.\nIf it is desired to use conductive support\ncables, they can be used to carry power.\nIn this case, the addition of suitable RF\nabsorbing materials may be needed to\n\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\nreduce the effect on the measurement\naccuracies.

NPO-44090\n\nFluidic Actuators with No Moving Parts\nLangley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia\nTwo new fluidic actuator designs were\ndeveloped to control fluid flow in ways\nthat will ultimately result in improved system performance and fuel efficiency in\ntoimprove the aerodynamic performance\nof a variety of vehicles. These flow control\nactuators, often referred to as fluidic oscillators or sweeping jet actuators, utilize the\nCoanda effect to generate spatially oscillating bursts (or jets). They can be embedded directly into a control surface (such\nas a wing or a turbine blade) to help\nreduce flow separation, increase lift,\nreduce drag, enhance mixing, or increase\nheat transfer. Recent studies show up to a\n60% performance enhancement (such as\nincreased lift or reduced drag) with fluidic actuators.\n\nOne of the actuator designs effectively\ndecouples the oscillation frequency from\nthe amplitude (i.e. mass flow through the\nactuator). A decoupled actuator can deliver\nhigh mass flow rates without changing the\nfrequency, or deliver high- or low-frequency\noscillating jets at minimal mass flow rates.\nThe second actuator design enables inphase or anti-phase synchronization of the\noscillating jets. This overcomes issues\ncaused by the random oscillation of individual actuators when they are used in an array\nof actuators, and has particular benefit for\nflow-control applications. These new\ndesigns will provide better control authority\nover the fluidic actuator, increased actuator\nefficiency, decreased mass flow, and\nimproved system performance.\n\nMotion Control and Automation Technology, June 2014\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nThe new actuator designs do not\nrequire any additional equipment\xe2\x80\x94\noscillations, decoupling, and synchronization are achieved in a passive manner, entirely via internal flow dynamics.\nSince these actuators have simple and\ncompact structure and do not have any\nmoving parts, they are basically maintenance-free, and highly scalable. They\ncan be manufactured from many different materials and therefore can also be\nused in harsh environments.\nThis work was done by Mehti Koklu of\nLangley Research Center.

The\nof the\nliquid and its height create pressure on\nthe diaphragm of the pressure transducer to generate an accurate and cost-effective level measurement. Generally, pressure transducers can be used for level\nmeasurement from 10 inches of water\ncolumn up to 10,000 PSI (700 bar).\nDesigned with stainless steel and\nHytrel materials, submersible pressure\ntransducers are reliable, cost-effective\ninstruments to measure the level of various liquids including water and diesel.\nThese pressure sensors are an ideal\nchoice for mobile applications such as\nships, train cars, or when the tank is\ntransported between locations such as\nfor construction sites, chemical totes for\nindustrial processing, or well site injection chemicals.\nA variety of factors should be considered when installing a submersible pressure transducer in a tank. The figure\nshows one installation method used by\nAmerican Sensor Technologies for its\nAST4510 submersible transducer using\na rigid pipe. The transducer comes standard with a 1/2" NPT male conduit connection at the base of the cable connection. In tanks that are turbulent due to\nan inlet/fill pipe or the use of an agitator, the transducer can have rigid plastic\nor metal conduit installed over the\ncable to prevent sensor movement within the tank.\nThe conduit over the cable is mounted to a bung at the top of the tank. Parts\nthat thread onto a 1.5" female NPT\nbung and have a 1/2" female NPT\nthread can mate the ridid conduit. The\ncable exits the tank and is held in place\nby a cord grip that runs to the control\nbox. The same cable grip can be used at\nthe junction box, ensuring that the vent\ntube is clear. Depending on hazardous\nlocation requirements, this can be in the\n\nnon-hazardous area with connection to\nthe intrinsically safe barrier. In this\nexample, it is expected that the junction\nbox is properly vented to the atmosphere to prevent water ingress.\nIn this application, the pressure sensor was installed above the base of the\nbottom of the tank. As sludge and silt\ntend to line the bottom of the tank, a\nheight of 100 millimeters was calculated\nto ensure the process connection did\nnot clog over time. The diaphragm of\nthe transducer is close to the top of the\nprocess connection hex, so operators\ncan calculate the offset from when the\ntank is empty.\n\n8a\n\nwww.techbriefs.com/motion\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nOther applications may have the submersible pressure transducer installed\ndirectly into an intrinsically safe radio\ndevice at the top of the tank. This\nreduces the cost of the transducer, as\nless cable and less time are required for\nthe installation. With shorter cable\nlengths, a voltage output signal with low\ncurrent consumption is an option if the\nsystem is battery operated. Less current\nconsumption means longer battery life\nand less maintenance.\nThis article was contributed by American\nSensor Technologies (AST), Mount Olive, NJ.\nFor more information, visit http://info.\nhotims.com/49746-322.\n\nMotion Control and Automation Technology, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nWhy Lin?\n\nThe Step Motor Specialists\n\nWhy Every Day More Engineers\nChoose Lin Engineering\nOver the past decade, Lin Engineering has\ngained a tremendous amount of market\nshare and earned a reputation as the\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeader in Step Motor Technology.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nProven Application Support,\nPerformance, and Quality\n\nExtensive Product Line\n& Value Added Services\n\nUnrivaled Application Support\n\nStepper Motors ranging from NEMA 8 to NEMA 34\n\n98% application success rate\n95% of prototypes shipped in less than 1 week\n\nThe most complete line of high accuracy and low\nresonance 0.9 degree stepper motors\nValue added options such as: configurable shafts,\n\nHigh Performance\n\nwindings, and cable assemblies\n\nHighest torque output\nHigh accuracy = no skipping steps\nReduced vibration and resonance\n\nStepper Motors for vacuum, laboratory, and\nwash-down environments\n\nReliable Quality\nConsistent Performance\n4.5 Sigma System\nISO 9001 certified\nContinuous Improvement\n\nSatisfied Customers\n\nCustomers in 2004\n\nCustomers in 2014\n\n16245 Vineyard Blvd., Morgan Hill, CA 95037\nTel.

In this configuration, a\nstainless steel float coupled to a nonmagnetic stainlesssteel rod is attached to the armature core of the LVDT.\nThe 4- to 20-mA loop-powered position transmitter senses the position of the core and, therefore, the level of\nthe float. Sensitivity to the change in level depends on\nthe length of LVDT.\nAs water level changes, the float moves up or down, raising the LVDT core along with it. A\nthreaded stainless steel rod that protrudes from the other end of the core carries two jam nuts\nthat are used to adjust the position sensor output at the desired low water level.\nCore position is sensed using magnetic induction. Electronics of the LVDT are hermetically\nsealed inside a stainless steel housing for protection against water and other environmental elements. A Teflon liner inside the bore minimizes any friction to core motion. As there are no\nsprings to fatigue or parts to wear out, the LVDT sensors are nearly friction-free.\n\nWolverine\n\nMighty Mite\n\n12 V \xe2\x80\x93 450 VDC\n5 A \xe2\x80\x93 65 A\n\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-313\n\n-40\xc2\xb0C to 71\xc2\xb0C\n0 \xe2\x80\x93 20 kRPM\n\nMotion Stages\n\n2.7 lbs. / 1.2 kg\n\nBell-Everman (Goleta, CA) offers the\nSLS line of ballscrew- and linear-motordriven sealed motion stages that feature a\nlip seal design that keeps debris, particulate, and liquid contaminants from gumming up the internal drive and bearing components. Made from a ruggedized polyurethane elastomer, the seal integrates with the stage\xe2\x80\x99s anodized aluminum housing. The seal\xe2\x80\x99s design allows it to be field-replaceable without disassembling the\nstage. Linear motor configurations can achieve accuracies of \xc2\xb14 \xce\xbcm per meter of travel, and bidirectional repeatability of \xc2\xb12 \xce\xbcm. Ballscrew configurations can achieve accuracies of \xc2\xb110 \xce\xbcm per\nmeter of travel, and bidirectional repeatability of \xc2\xb15 \xce\xbcm.\nStandard travel lengths are available from 100 to 1,000 mm, with custom lengths to 2,000\nmm. Speeds to 4 m/sec for linear motor drives and 0.4 m/sec for ballscrew drives are achievable. Continuous linear force to 300 N is achievable for linear motor drives, and 1,540 N for\nballscrew drives. Applications include laser machining, welding, semiconductor, machining,\nand other contamination-sensitive precision motion applications.\n\nDragon\n\n24 V \xe2\x80\x93 610 VDC\n5 A \xe2\x80\x93 65 A\n-40\xc2\xb0C to 71\xc2\xb0C\n0 \xe2\x80\x93 20 kRPM\n6.4 lbs. / 2.9 kg\n\nVulcan\n\n610 VDC\n5 A \xe2\x80\x93 65 A\n-40\xc2\xb0C to 121\xc2\xb0C\n0 \xe2\x80\x93 20 kRPM\n11.5 lbs. / 5.2 kg\n\nRoadwind\n\n12 V \xe2\x80\x93 56 VDC\n5 A \xe2\x80\x93 300 A\n-40\xc2\xb0C to 71\xc2\xb0C\n40 \xe2\x80\x93 150 kRPM\n\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-316\n\n8.1 lbs. / 3.7 kg\n\nPosition Sensor\n\nHyperion\n\n450 V \xe2\x80\x93 800 VDC\n150 A \xe2\x80\x93 250 A\n\nThe Micronor MR330 Series fiber optic absolute position\nsensor system from Micronor (Newbury Park, CA) features\n14-bit single-turn resolution. Rotary sensors are offered in\ntwo models: Standard MR332 and MRI Safe MR338. The\nabsolute rotary encoder measures absolute angular position from 0\xc2\xb0 to 360\xc2\xb0 via programmable 13-bit (8,192\ncount) or 14-bit (13,950 count) resolution at\nspeeds exceeding 2500 rpm. System firmware\nalso tracks turns up to 12 bits (4096 revolutions).\nThe controller features multiple built-in interfaces: SSI, USB, RS485 Serial, Modbus RTU, two\nanalog outputs (4-20mA and \xc2\xb110V), and two digital set points.\nThe position sensor is an all-optical design that resists electromagnetic interference such as\nlightning, radiation, magnetic fields, and other harsh environmental conditions. It uses an optical technique embedded in a passive sensor and active controller connected by a duplex fiber\noptic link. The controller transmits a burst of light to the code disk in the sensor that modulates\nthe spectral components of the light based on angular position. The position information is\nimprinted in the optical spectrum of the light and guided back to the controller for position\nreadout. The sensor requires no electrical power and houses no electronic components.\n\n-40\xc2\xb0C to 71\xc2\xb0C\n40 \xe2\x80\x93 120 kRPM\n9.8 lbs. / 4.5 kg\n\nAVAILABLE OPTIONS\nDC Brushless, Brushed and Induction\nSensorless, Encoder, and Resolver\nChassis, Fan, or Liquid Cooled\nRuggedized, Semi-Rugged, and Industrial\n\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-325\n\nMotion Control and Automation Technology, June 2014\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nwww.techbriefs.com/motion\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nFree Info at http://info.hotims.com/49746-779\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\nNEW\n\nProducts\nAccelerometers\n\nMotion Controllers\n\nMeggitt Sensing Systems\n(Irvine, CA) offers Endevco\nModels 41A, 42A, and 43A\nIsotron accelerometers.\nThe general-purpose, single-axis accelerometers feature 10, 25, 100, 500, and 1000 mV/g sensitivities for the 41A and 42A,\nwith 100, 500, and 1000 mV/g for the 43A. Amplitude response of \xc2\xb15%\nis 1 to 10,000 Hz. The stud-mounted accelerometers have a 10-32\nthreaded hole. The Model 41A mounting bottom is a hex with 10-32\ntop connector; Model 42A mounting bottom is hex with 10-32 side\nconnector; and Model 43A has a cube shape that allows mounting in\ntwo different orientations, with the sensitive axis parallel to the connector and 10-32 connector. Optional accessories include cables, adhesive mounting adapter, and signal conditioners.\nThe Model 45A is a general-purpose, high-sensitivity triaxial\naccelerometer in a 20-mm cube shape with 500 mV/g (10 g range) and\n1000 mV/g (5 g range) options. Amplitude response of \xc2\xb15% is 1 to\n6000 Hz for y- and z-axes, and 1 to 3000 Hz for x-axis. They are also\nstud-mounted with a 10-32 threaded hole.\n\nTrio Motion Technology (Freeport, PA) has\nintroduced the MC403-Z motion controller in two versions offering\ncontrol of two or three axes. The\ncore axis connections can be configured as pulse and direction outputs to drives, or as incremental\nencoder feedback inputs or simulated\nencoder outputs. The three-axis variant\nallows one axis to be set-up as an extended axis where the connection may also be configured as an input for\nSSI, Tamagawa, or EnDAT absolute encoders.\nThe controllers feature a 64-bit ARM11 processor, digital and analog\nI/O count, built-in Ethernet, and the ability to add robotic transformations or synchronize motion with double floating point precision. The\ncontroller can undertake linear, circular, helical, and spherical interpolation across all axes, as well as flexible CAM shapes and linked\nmotion. The controller has eight 24 VDC digital inputs including six\n20-\xce\xbcsec registration inputs, and four 24 VDC bi-directional I/Os. Two\n12-bit analog inputs are included, and an RJ45 Ethernet port is provided for programming and connection of HMI or other devices.\n\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-318\n\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-328\n\nEtherCAT Drive Modules\nACS Motion Control (Bloomington, MN)\nhas introduced UDMMC compact EtherCAT\nmodules that feature two and four universal\ndrives with ratings of 12 Vdc to 80Vdc, and\n2.5A (5A peak) to 20A (40A peak) per drive.\nEach drive is programmable to control a twoor three-phase servomotor, a DC brush motor,\na voice coil motor, and a two- or three-phase\nstep motor. The motor drives address the\nneeds of multi-axis motion applications with\nlimited space.\nThe safe torque off (STO) cuts the power to the motor without\nremoval of the power source for applications that are required to comply with SIL-3 and PLe safety levels. The four-axis modules can be\nordered with mixed current specifications. It is a slave drive that runs\nunder any ACS EtherCAT masters. The MMI Application Studio, a set\nof software support tools, is provided for configuration, setup, tuning,\nand diagnostics.\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-319\n\nLinear Motor Stages\nKollmorgen (Radford, VA) has introduced MMG series linear motor\nstages in four models that\ndeliver 25-mm, 50-mm, 100mm, and 150-mm travel.\nThey provide uncompensated accuracy from 6 um to 14\num, and resolution from 1.0\num to 5 nm. Each model delivers\nrepeatability to \xc2\xb10.4 um, and is rated\nfor 10-kg load capacity. The stages feature an integrated feedback mechanism that eliminates the need for compensation\ntables or slope correction factors. A standard Z-axis counterbalance kit\neliminates the engineering required to integrate a Z option. The stages\nleverage a standard 3-phase brushless motor to enable control with various drives and controllers. No specialized piezo or proprietary\nmotor/drive technology is necessary. They can be used in constant\nvelocity (CV) or high throughput point-to-point applications, allowing\ncommon units to be used.\n\nWorkholding Vice\n\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-315\n\nThe RZM Centric Vice from R\xc3\xb6hm Products of\nAmerica (Lawrenceville, GA) provides workholding rigidity and contributes to higheraccuracy 5-axis machining. The vice\xe2\x80\x99s\ndesign features clamping jaws positioned relatively high, and a horizontal\nspindle situated at the top of the vice and\ncloser to the jaws. The jaws are shorter and complement the vice\xe2\x80\x99s overall compact height of 7.7" to minimize interference.\nThe double jaw-guidance system moves jaws along their axes to accommodate a range of part sizes without having to remount the jaws. In operation, the first jaw moves along an outside guideway as the second jaw\ntravels on an inside one. This quasi-telescopic arrangement allows for a\ngreater guidance length without placing significant limits on machining\noperations. When fully opened, the RZM presents little, if any, interference, and its telescoping design allows the jaws to close to the zero point.\n\nTool Positioning System\nThe EPPINGER Trifix\xc2\xae tool positioning system from\nEXSYS Tool (San Antonio, FL) enables exchanges of\nboth static and driven tooling for multitasking\nmachines. Based on the VDI interface, the system\nprovides positioning accuracy within 10 \xce\xbcm between\ntool stations, and single-position repeatability of less\nthan 5 \xce\xbcm at a tool length of 3.9" (100 mm). After the\nuser initially aligns the unit in the lathe turret, further\nadjustment for subsequent tool changes becomes unnecessary. As a result, manufacturers can preset tools off the machine,\nreducing setup time. Tooling can be mounted with four additional\nhold-down screws to maximize rigidity in heavy-chipload operations\nsuch as milling. Use of the Trifix system does not prevent a facility from\nusing other tooling.\n\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-326\n\n14a\n\nFor Free Info Visit http://info.hotims.com/49746-329\n\nwww.techbriefs.com/motion\n\nIntro\n\nCov\n\nToC\n\n+\n\nMotion Control and Automation Technology, June 2014\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x9e\xad\n\n\xe2\x9e\xae\n\n'
