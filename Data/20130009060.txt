b'"I\'m trying to figure out\nwhat my role is in the\nworld of astronomy. "\n\n\'tiij\'\'\':UI!.\'\'\n\nA conversation\n\nabout observation\nIn the spirit of the Lindau Meeting, we present a\ndialogue between a Nobel laureate and a y oung researcher.\nThis interchange started online, where it continues to\nunfold. Here is a digest of this conversation, which has\ndeveloped across time and space.\n\nDear Professor Mather,\n[t was really lovely to meet you at the\nLindau Meeting. [had a wonderful, thoughtprovoking week that left me feeling buzzed\nup and raring to do science!\nMy name is Minnie and I\'ve just started a\npostdoc at the NRAO. I submitted my PhD\non the cosmic evolution of radi o sources in\nApril and will (hopefully!) graduate from\nth e University of Tasmania in December\nthis year. New Mexico is somewhat different\nfrom Tasmania, but I\'m really enjoying it\nhere - especially being based at the array\noperations centre for the Karl G. jans1 Very\n:)\'\nLarge Array (VLA).\nThis brings me to why I do astron omy: I\nlove observi ng. [ love the process of deciding\nto \'look\' at something, setting up th e\ntelescope, waiting in breathless anticipation\nfor th e photons to hit the detector, or\nwatching the cross-correlations dance across\na computer screen. I even love reducing th e\ndata, knowing that shortly I will be seeing\nsomething no one has ever seen and using it\nto answer my science questio ns.\nWhat do you think will be the most\nimportan t result to come fro m the JWST?\nWill they be driven by predicted th eories\nor by observations that yield completely\nunexpected results, which we couldn\'t\npossibly have known had we not observed\nsomething new, as was the case with the\nHubble Deep Field?\nI love my new job. Learning aUabout\nthe VLA isso much fun, but now that I\'m\nstarting to get used to the fact that I\'m no\nlonger a student, I\'m trying to figure out\nwhat my role is in the world of astronomy.\nClear skies,\nMinnie Yuan Mao\n\n\'\'After aU these years,\n\nwe still have a hard time\nmaking a theoretical\nsupernova explode."\nDear Mirutie,\nThanks for your letter! I Like to be caU\ned\nJohn; I\'m still not used to formal titles.\nMy owl1 passion for physics and\nastronomy has a lot to do with a desire to\nbuild tllings. When I was a tee nager [learned\na lot from the Scientific American monthly\nfeature called The Amateur Scientist, and I\nborrowed tlle 3-volLun e book series Amateur\nTelescope Making from the library over and\nover again. I did build a small telescope, but\nII O C TO B E R 20 12\n\nVOL 490\n\nNA T U RE\n\n55\n\n"liliN\']1 PHYSICS MASTERCLASS I\nI didn\'t have the patience to grind a mirror\n- I bought that. I also loved thinking about\nelectronics, and I wanted to be a ham radio\noperator, so I assembled a Heathkit AR-3\nradio receiver (with vacuum tubes) and read\nThe ARRL Handbook from cover to cover,\nover and over.\nThere\'s a wonderful book by Martin\nHarwit called Cosmic Discovery that lists\nthe greatest d iscoveries in astronomy, and\nshows what made them possible. In almost\nevery case, the discovery came from new\nequipment, and in a pretty large fracti on\nof cases the eq uipment was designed for\nsome other purpose. So I see a path to\ngreat discovery: imagine a meas urement\nthat could answer a question, and build\nsomething to make the measurement. Then,\neither you answer the question, or you find\nsomething new. But in either case, it will\nbe something nobody else could do. Have\nyou given any thought to good strategies fo r\nmaking your own discoveries?\nThat leads to you r other question: what\nwill be the most important d iscoveries\nwith th e JWST? Of co urse, I don\'t know\nspecifically, but it seems th at surprise is\npart of importance - if everyone knows\nsomething already, it is not a discovery. No\ntheorists or obser vers predicted the correct\nstory for galaxy formation before the Hubble\nSpace Telescope was launched, neither group\npredicted cosmic dark energy or dark matter\n(though Fritz Zwicky saw evidence for dark\nm atter in the 1930s), and neither predicted\nthe nature and abundance of planetary\nsystems beyond our own Solar System . My\nfriends doing numerical simulations of stars\nand galaxies in supercomputers agree that\nthey are not going to predict what we will\nfind wi th any certain ty - the complexity is\njust too great. And after all th ese years, we\nstill have a h ard time making a theoretical\nsupernova explode.\n\nNASA\' s John Mather says discoveri es com e\nf ro m new equij>ment.\n\nSo, I think the JWST will lead to som e\ngreat surprise that nobody is even thinkin g\nabout today. Perhaps, you will be the one to\nfi nd that sur prise.\nW ith best wishes for your new role as a\nDiscoverer!\nJohn M ather\n\n"Learning is not just about\naccumulating information;\nit\'s also about the process of\ngetting that information. "\nDear John,\nI like the \'discoverer\' tag: I think that\nis what science is about - the discovery\nof new things, new phenomena, new\nconcepts, new ideas.\n\ncom e up with somethi.n g truly innovative?\nUnless you ar e directly involved in the\nbuilding and commissioning of a new\ntelescope, do you th ink you ca n rea lly\nunderstand it enough to design creative\nexperim ents that will produce groundbreaking science?\nClear skies,\nMilmie\n\n"The challenge is to\nuse our imagination to\nthe fullest . "\n\nMinnie Mao beli eves in j>u shing a\ntelescoj>e\'s capabilities.\n\nYou asked if10 given an y thought to good\nstrategies for making my own discoveries.\nI\'ve thought about this a lot. When I was\napplying for postdocs at th e end oflast\nyear I looked for jobs that had a telescope\nsupport element. I wanted a job th at would\nlet me get to know the telescope. I fi gure\nthat understandin g a telescope\'s capabilities\nand limitations will enable m e to ask sc ience\nquestions that the telescope is able to answer.\nI did my PhD in Aus trali a where I spent\na lot of tim e at the Australia Telescope\nCom pact Array (ATCA). I learned so m uch\nby being on -site, th ings like how m uch\nmicrowave ovens affect observations at\n13 cm (a lo t!). Experiences like these enabled\nme to un derstand my data intimately and\nhence distinguish real science from image\nartefacts and other distractions. As sud l ,\nI felt like I was able to tailor my projects to\nmake the most of the ATCA\'s capabilities.\nConve rsely, the VLA has dedicated\ntelescope operators who observe fo r you.\nI wish I coul d d o m ore of the observing\nmyself though. I think learning is not\njust about accumulating information;\nit\'s also about the process of getting th at\ninform ation. I could go away and read all\nthe how- to manuals about th e telescope and\nits data products, but un til I actually see the\ntelescope work, and reduce the data myself,\nI will not truly understand it.\nI feel like I\'m at the tail -end of th e\ngeneratio n of astronomers that gets to\nactually play with tel escopes.

All rights reserved\n\nD ear Minnie,\nI like your strategy of\'playing with\ntelescopes\' to understand their capabili ties\nand limitations. I thin k it\'s important because\nso many great discoveries happen at the very\nedge of capabilities. The am azing story of\nth e early galaxies is only barely discernible\nfrom tiny coloured dots on the Hubble deepfield images, and it has taken tremendous\npersisten ce on the part of the observers and\ninstmm ent builders to know how to: (a) get\nscientific discoveries from little coloured\ndots; and (b) get better equipment to see\nth em more clearly. Similarly, what we know\nof exoplanets has com e mostly from people\nwho knew how to push the capabilities of\nexisting equipment (first), an d then pushed\nto get better equipment (after the richness of\nthe discoveries becanl e apparent).\nYou seem a bit concerned that you won\'t\nbe able to learn enough abou.t telescopes\nwithout to uching them . I have that feeling\ntoo, but I think we are more and more ab le\nto experience things we can\'t see or touch.\nAfter all, astronom y is all about thin gs we\ncan o nly see from immense distan ces! I\'m\nwriting th is on a com puter run ning on\nhardware I\'ve never seen, based on quantum\nmechanics that hardly anyone wlderstands.\nAt NASA, I\'m working on a gian t telescope\nthat for years existed only in the imagination,\nalong with a few documents and viewgraphs,\nand now two of the four instrwllents are\ndeli vered and all of the mirrors are finished.\nSo, the challenge is to use our imagination\nto the full est! Hands-on observing is a way to\nbuild that imagination, but total immersion\nin using something you can\'t touch still\nworks. So to answer your question, yes, I\ntruly expect there will be many people with\nthe expertise to com e up with something\ntmly innovative. We are building the JWST\nso that a generati on of people who were not\neven born when itwas started will be able to\nuse it for breathtakin g discoveries.\nFear not, just dive in!\nJolm\n\n"What I do object to is\nthe complete removal\nof the astronomer from\nthe observing and datareduction process."\nDear John ,\nI\'m really pleased to hear that you\'re\nnot worried about the reduction in\nhands-on observing opportun ities. While\nhands-on observing is something I enj oy\npassionately, I guess I can understand that\nit\'s not necessarily vital to being a brilliant\nastronomer.\nHaving said that, I disagree that\nlmaginati on can replace th e wealth of\nknowledge garnered from sitting in front\nof a terminal and actually being in control\nof a telescope. You say "total immersion in\nusing so meth.ing you can\'t touch still WOrks\';\nbut is that really true? To use your computer\nan alogy, you can read hWldreds of books\nabout computers, but you lea rn most about\nhow to use your computer by sitting at it and\nactually playing with it.\n\nIn my last letter, I focused on being\nphysically at a telescope to use it. Obviously\nth is is not feasib le for telescopes sud l as\nHubble and the JWST. But even in these\ncircw11Stances, what I do object to is the\ncomplete removal of the astrono mer from\nthe observing and data red uctio n process.\nRadio telescopes are m ovin g towards a\nmodel where the astrono mer puts in th eir\nobserving request and is th en prOvi ded\nwith completely reduced data. I wlderstand\nthat this is so mewhat necessary due to the\nexorbitantly large sizes of the data sets, but\nI still find it troubling.\nTwenty years ago if you wanted to use\na telescope, you went to the telescope,\nyou observed, and you were responsible\nfor reducing your data and analys ing it.\nNowadays, hands-on observing is becoming\nless prevalent. Science isn\'t suffering yet\nbecause the astronomers still retain their\nobserving and data-red uction experience.\nBut what happens 20 years from now, with\n\na new generation of astronomers? I\'m not\nconvinced th at truly innovative ways of\nexploiting a telescope will be possible when\nth e telescope users are obiivious to the\nobservation and data reduction processes.\nWhat are you planning on d oing with the\nJWST? Will approved observing programs\ndeUver completely reduced data? Will the\nastro nomer eve n know when their proposed\nobjects are being observed?\nClear skies,\nMinnie\n\n"There is never the final\nanswer to anything, only\nthe best answer we think\nwe have at the time."\nDear M.innie,\nI agree com pletely that hands-on\nobserving is the way to go when possible.\nThere\'s nothillg like actually touching\nthings and studying them in person to get\nlrul\'t (l hope) marry\nacquainted. One wOU\nsomebody over th e internet without meeting\nh.im/her! But as time goes o n we all get used\nto ignoring the inner working of thing,\nas long as they are reUable. Hardl y anyone\neven knows how a car works dlese days, or\neven suspects dlat it has perhaps a hundred\nmicroprocessors running Uttle dedicated\ntasks. So we get to concentrate o n top- level\nissues, like where to go and how fast. I think\nmodern astronomy has go tten to that point\ntoo - we have software packages with\nmi.lJjons of Unes of code, and we trust that\nsomebody ha made them work righ t. And\nwe have observatories widl complexities\nd1at are completely hidden from the user\nmost of the tinle. Of course, the sceptical and\ncautious user (a real scientist) will not believe\nevelything in the users\' manual for either\na telescope or a software package, and will\nfin d a way to test every important feature,\notherwise we will have a lot of non-science.\nI th.ink dle real breakthrough science will still\n\'\ncome from people who push the capabilities\nof these tools beyond their design limits and\ntest what happe ns. T hat will take familiarity\nwith deSign , and lmagination to pictme what\ncannot be seen.\nAbout JWST, there\'s no such th ing\nas completely reduced data from any\nob ervatory. We do expect that the\nobservers will receive data already\nconverted into units of astronomical\nbrigh tn ess, according\nto dle best cal ibration\ninform ation and\nalgorithms we have.\nBut if an object is\nvery fain t, it wi U\n\nhave to be observed over a long period of\ntime with m ultip le exposures that have\nto be combined; the process of doing the\ncombination is not so sinlple, and the\ncautious observer may want to do it h.im/\nherself. But that\'s stu\'! a very lo ng jwnp\nfrom data gathering to interpretation of\nthe objects way out there - that remains\nthe observer\'s remi t. And there is never\nthe final answer to anything, only the best\nanswer we think we have at th e tim e. And\nyes, the astronomers will know when their\nproposed objects will be observed. (Smal.l\ncaveat: we are setting up the telescope to\nhave a Uttle auto nomy, so if an observatio n\ncannot be completed in sequence, the\ntelescope will automatica lly go to the next\none on its list.)\n\nI find it very exciting to know of th e\ndiscoveries made by people working far\nfrom my own specialties. And once in a\nwhile a conversation occu rs that starts a\nnew field of research , just from asking a\nquestion about so mething that is obviolls\nto one person but not to anodler. We have\ndark matter in astronomy dl at i a total\nmystery. But there is a form of dark matter\nin genetic material too, and just lately it was\nannounced that it is extremely lmportant:\nthe dark matter between dle ge nes is\nactually millions of digita l swi tch es. I don\'t\nknow when a brea.kdlrough like dl at for\nd ark matter and dark energy will occur for\nast ronomers. But why not? And in another\narea of astrono my, sudd enly we know th at\nthere are as many exoplan ets as th ere are\ntars, dlat small o nes are very ab undant,\nand th at many have been expeU into\ned\nspace and have no star ally more.\nSo I think o ne of th e most interesting\nways to phrase a question in sc ience is: "If\nX happe ns, then what?" What do you think\nare interes ting qu esti ons?\n\nAll dl e best,\nJohn\n\nTo see this conversation continue online, visit\nL\nindau.nature.comllindaulonline dialogue\n\n11 OCTOBER 20 1 2\n\nVOL 490\n\nAT U RE\n\nS7\n\n'
