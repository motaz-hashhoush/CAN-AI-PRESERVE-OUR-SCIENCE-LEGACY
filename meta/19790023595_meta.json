Ribbons were grown up to lengths of one meter, with widths increasing linearly up to one cm at the point of termination of growth. Thermal data were collected and evaluated for actual seeding and growth with variations in parameters affecting heat loss. It was found that for suitable growth, the mechanical system should be very rigid and stable, and the tolerances and specifications of the quartz crucibles must be far tighter than normal quartz tolerances. The widening rates of the ribbons were found to be a function of the temperature gradient rather than the temperature differences alone. A twin spacing in the seed of 3 microns to 2 microns was found to be unfavorable for growth; whereas spacing of 0.9 microns to 2 microns and 8 microns to 2 microns were favorable. Thermal modeling studies of the effects of furnace design parameters on the temperature distributions in melt and the growth of the dendritic web ribbon showed that the pull rate of the ribbon is strongly dependent on the temperature of the top thermal shield, the spacing between this shield and the melt, and the thickness of the growing web.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790023595, "id": "72d77be855024932a9ecbe07f44c60ee", "publicationDate": "1977-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790023595.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790023595/downloads/19790023595.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790023595/downloads/19790023595.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790023595/downloads/19790023595.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
