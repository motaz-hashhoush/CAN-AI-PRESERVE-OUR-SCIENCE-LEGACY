This 16 g \"rocklet\" was collected at Station 13 on the ejecta blanket of North Ray Crater at the foot of Smoky Mountain [2]. Originally classified as a Very High Alumina (VHA) basalt on geochemical grounds [3], it was later argued to be an impact melt rock [4]. Here we report a Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic study that shows that some portions of the rock failed to reach isotopic equilibrium on last melting in agreement with the impact melt rock interpretation. Nevertheless, by omitting mineral fractions that are discordant with the majority of the data, we arrive at the time of last melting as 3.88 plus or minus 0.05 Ga ago. This age is in agreement with the Ar-39/Ar-40 plateau age of 3839 plus or minus 23 Ma [5], if the latter is adjusted for the ~1.4-1.8% revision in the age of the hornblende monitor [6]. This investigation was undertaken in part as proof-of-concept for SPA-basin sample return.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20110007849, "endDate": "2011-03-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "meetingId": "f68eb69ad71643bd9bc4a7da5a97b62f", "id": "c66d75291d384a23a3d8c5c5f2880024"}], "name": "42nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference", "location": "Woodlands, TX", "id": "f68eb69ad71643bd9bc4a7da5a97b62f", "startDate": "2011-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110007849, "id": "5fc0151366794b98a4f3a8e348b12846", "publicationDate": "2011-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110007849.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110007849/downloads/20110007849.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110007849/downloads/20110007849.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110007849/downloads/20110007849.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
