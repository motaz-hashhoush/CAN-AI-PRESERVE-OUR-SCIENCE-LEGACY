In addition,\nwill\nthe circuit\nindicate by an output signal whether a\nparity error exists. The circuit can also generate or check\n\nE 1 Register\n\nx4\nParity\nFault\n\n.\nE1 Register\n\nx3\nParity\nFault\n\nRegistei\n\nx2\nParity\nFault\n\n1 Parity Input\nSignal Associated\nWith E1\n\nE 1 Registei\n\nParity\nError\nSignal\n\nLegend:\n* 0b1\n=b\n** = b2b3\nt = bb5\ntt = bb\n\nGenerated\nParity\nJSignals\nFigure 1.

This is done by making\nthe appropriate internal wiring connections on the LSI\nchip.\nHow it\'s done:\nAs shown in Figure 1, the parity-check circuit\nincludes 16 identical circuits. Four of these circuits are\nassociated with a specific eight-bit storage register. They\nare cascaded to allow the input of each subsequent\nstage to receive the output from the preceding stage.\nAs shown in Figure 2, each of the logic groups receives,\nas its input, a unique two of the eight bits (b 0 through\nb 7 ) of all four storage registers (E 1 through E4). Odd\nparity is defined as the state in which one or all of three\nbits (two of the data bits plus a carry bit) are true\n(logical "1"). A carry output signal (C 2 , C 3 , and C4)\nis produced and coupled to the next stage. In essence,\nthe circuit as shown in Figure 2 adds the two data bits\no\n\n0\xe2\x80\x94cl\nC\n\n\t\n\nC\n\nand the carry-in bit (the carryout of the previous\nstage). The result is a carryout signal. After this process\nripples down through the four logic states, the final\ncarryout signal determines if the eight-bit register has an\neven or odd number of logical "1" bits.\nIf this final signal is a logical "0", the register\ncontains an even number of "1" bits. If the signal is a\n"1", an odd number of "1" bits exists in the register.\nThis signal is compared to known reference bits to check\nthe parity of each of the four registers.\nIf the data are more than eight bits, the sequence is\nsimilar. For 16 bits, input/output stages are used to\nperform a parity check on the total bits. As shown in\nFigure 1, P 1 (carryout) of the first stage is connected to\nE2 of the second stage. The E2 point that is shown as\ngrounded is lifted to allow this connection. The output\nP2 is then used as a final carryout signal. This scheme\nmay be extended to longer word lengths of 24 and\n32 bits by making the appropriate internal wiring\nconnections.\n\nn\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nNASA Headquarters\nCode KT\nWashington, D.
