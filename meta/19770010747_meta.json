Of the elicited ideas, more than 20% involved processing of biologicals, or related medical and life sciences applications. Among these were High Purity Separation of Isoenzymes, and Development of Biorhythms applications data. Program planning for four products is outlined. Experimentation and testing resulted in definition of nearly 70 series of tests in ground-based laboratories, sounding rockets, etc., and space shuttle. Development schedules established timing and interrelationships of decisions involved in carrying these products to the point of production. The potential profitability of the four products is determined. Resources needed to achieve full scale production included use of shuttle for transportation, for which cost apportionment model was developed. R and D resources for the four products totalled $46,000,000 with Isoenzymes requiring the smallest expenditure, $4,000,000. A computerized profitability model (INVEST) was used to determine the measures of profitability of each product. Results build confidence that there will be a payoff.", "title": "Beneficial uses of space", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T20:21:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19770010747, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bloom, H.
