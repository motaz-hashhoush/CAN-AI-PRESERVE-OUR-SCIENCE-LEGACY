Power equations representing these relations are presented for six airplane groups: general aircraft, turboprop transports, small jet transports, conventional jet transports, wide-body transports, supersonic transports, and for reciprocating, turboshaft, and turbothrust engines. Market prices calculated for a number of aircraft by  use of the equations together with the aircraft characteristics are in reasonably good agreement with actual prices. Such price analyses are of value in the assessment of new aircraft devices and designs and potential research and development programs.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19750063429, "endDate": "1975-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Allied Weight Engineers"}}, "meetingId": "4ee43b12ff7d42da9c79aa112940b858", "id": "42eb485f20004a15b57b64f1efddaf64"}], "name": "Society of Allied Weight Engineers, Annual Conference", "location": "Seattle, WA", "id": "4ee43b12ff7d42da9c79aa112940b858", "startDate": "1975-05-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750063429, "id": "9d397399d8744011b0ad56df2e7ff6e5", "publicationDate": "1975-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
