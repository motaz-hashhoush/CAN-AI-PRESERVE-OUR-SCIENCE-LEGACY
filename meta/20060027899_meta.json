An overview of spacesuit flight-rated personal cooling systems is presented, which includes a brief history of cooling systems from Gemini through Space Station missions. The roles of the liquid cooling garment, thermal environment extremes, the sublimator, multi-layer insulation, and helmet visor UV and solar coatings are reviewed. A second section is presented on advanced personal cooling systems studies, which include heat acquisition studies on cooling garments, heat rejection studies on water boiler & radiators, thermal storage studies, and insulation studies. Past and present research and development and challenges are summarized for the advanced studies.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20060027899, "endDate": "2004-09-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Defense Threat Reduction Agency", "location": "VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "47908828839e4ce783fee8c8c04e01ee", "id": "40d3290e6fa54ddbb499234fa0e55c58"}], "name": "Microclimate Cooling Conference", "location": "Natick, MA", "id": "47908828839e4ce783fee8c8c04e01ee", "startDate": "2004-09-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060027899, "id": "e59fe8f69ecc4689a301f743c0fcb24c", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
