On battery #3, the deleterious impact of its soft short increased day by day, manifesting itself as a drop in battery voltage part-way through each eclipse, causing high loading on the remaining good battery. This paper reports how by planned charge management, including applying (against-the-book) overcharge ratios (C/D) exceeding 1.75, the battery #3 cell soft short was 'built down' until the cell voltage fade ceased. The problem with the battery #3 soft-shorted cell was fought with partial success throughout the latter half of the fall 93 season, and the lessons learned were applied to alleviate the problem during the spring 94 and fall 94 eclipse seasons. The life of the spacecraft was successfully prolonged until it was retired in March 1995.", "title": "Soft-short management and remediation in 10-year-old NiCds in Geo orbit", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T09:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960020578, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Flordeliza, Nicanor A."}, "organization": {"name": "General Electric Co.", "location": "Princeton, NJ United States"}}, "id": "38368ca548a742879b546ce96d1fb55b"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19960020578, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bounds, Ronald W."}, "organization": {"name": "Aerospace Consulting Group, Inc.", "location": "Princeton,  Unknown"}}, "id": "7db4a68fdae540279755277804b34963"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960020578, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960020578, "id": "fb54e86309bf4abbb359bbd4130de704", "publicationName": "The 1995 NASA Aerospace Battery Workshop", "publicationDate": "1996-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19960020567, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "The 1995 NASA Aerospace Battery Workshop", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
