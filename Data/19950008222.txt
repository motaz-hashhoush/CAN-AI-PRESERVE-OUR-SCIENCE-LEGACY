NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)and\nThiokol Corporat~on worked with other industry representahave\ntives and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to\nprepare a comprthensive plan to eliminate all ozonodepleting\nchemicals from nianufacturing processes and reduce the use of\nother hazardous materials used to produce the space shuttle reusable solid rocket motors. The team used a classical approach for\nproblem-solving combined with a creative synthesis of new ap\nproaches to attack this challenge.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe manufacturing processes that were acceptable in the early\n1980s are not acceptable in the \'90s. Forty--seven percent of the\norganizations that were Fortune 500 companies 10 years ago m\nno longer there. They were not adaptive enough to survive in the\nchanging busir~sss\nenvironment. As budgets become smaller and\ncompetition requlies us to work smmer, faster, and more efficiently. weneed tc make sure theprocessesandproductswedevelop in the \'90s serve us aell into the 2 1st century. As our ability to\ngather data on the state of the Earth\'s environmental health increases. Enrimnn~enmlly\nSound Manufacturing must become an\nIntegral part of the busmess dec~s~on\nmaking process.\n\nBRIEF HIST9RY OF EN\'lIRONMENTAL\nREGULATORY ACTIVITY\nThe \'70s are remembered as the beginning of the . ,dative environmental movement with the passage of the h .tional E .;-onmental Policy Act (NEPA. 1969). the Clean Air and Clean .dter\nActs, the Toxic SubstancesConaol Act (TSCA). and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). The \'80s concentrated on\ntreatment. storage, disposal, and cleanup of solid and hazardous\nwastes, and public involvement with the passage of the\nEmergency Planning and Community Right-to-Knv . Act\n(EPCRA). The \'90s have given us the Pollution Revention Act.\nthe Oil Pollution hot. additional ngulations on hazardous air polliimts (HAPS),water toxins. acid rain, and the production ban of\nozone depleting compounds (ODCs)scheduled to take effect Ianuary 1. 1996.

RECOGNIZE A PROBLEM EXISTS\nWhen the Montreal Pmtocol members promulgated their document outlining theendofproduction of ODCs, the NASA/Tliokol\nteam realized a need to start looking at changes to Thiokol matcrials and processes in order to be prepared for eventual elimination\nof O K s . In 1992. when Resident Bush moved those elimination\ndates to 1%. the awareness of future challenges became much\nmore acute. A likely extens~on the end of RSRM production\nto\nadded to the immediacy of the problem of ODC replacement.\nWhen a survey was completed determining theprocesses that used\nODCs and the quantities being used by the various divisior s. we\nrecognized the magnitude of our problem.\n\n0.0\n\nmw\nma\n\n0 9 B O 8 1 9 2 Q ~ 0 l 9 7 ~ S B 0 0 O l ~\nM1DtSJI-11\n\nFig. 2.

ORGANIZE TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM\nThiokol\'s Corporate Sdety and Environmental Affairs director\nappointd an interdivisional solvent elimination coordinator in\nearly 1991. Each Thiokol division then selected a coonlinato: and\nwas assigneda solventreplacement task basedupon highest usage.\nSpace Operations was assigned methyl chloroform-I. I . l-trichloroethane (TCA). Each division was eventually tasked with nplacement of the solvents peculiar to their programs.\n3. MORE CLEARLY STATE THE PROBLEM\nAND ESTABLLSH A PLAN OF ACTION\n\nAn overall corporate hazardous solvent eliminationplan was produced. Eachdivisionsubmittedapreiiminary eliminationplan. An\noverall schedule was prepared in early 1991 predicting that production phaseout would come at the end of 19%. Bonds were\nrecognized as being critical to the reliability of the motors. therfore. no bonds would be changed without data to qualify equal or\nbetter margins of safety.\n4. EXECUTIVE PLANODC ELIMINATION STRATEGY\n\nThe ThiokolflrlASAstrategy used to eliminateall ODC from solid\nrocket motor production followed sound engineering principles.\nThe issue was well defined. There would be a production ban of\nODCs on January 1, 19%. Thiokol Spcx Operations ODC use in\n1989had been almost one million pounds in direct manufacturing\noperations and anotker 400,000 pounds in indirect use (Fig. 2). A\ndetailed study of each ODC used identified 852 manufacturing\nllouts in official planning documents. Ova 100different bonds\nin the motor were affected Ihc rebability of the motor dependson\nthese bonds to prevent hot gases from naching metal sbuctural\ncomponents. A Paretoanalysis (Fig. 3) wasconductedto prioritize\nthe 32 major categories of use. The two biggest usen wen vapor\n&greasers like the one shown in Fig. 4. This analysis indicated that\napproximately 90 percent of the TCA use was in the top four\ncategories. i.e.. two large TCA vapor degreasers. diluent for preservative grease. and as a cleaner for propellant mix and cast\ntooling. Possible replacement processes for the vapor depaser\nwen evaluated. Requalification testing myired for all of the 852\nplanning changes and l00plus affected bonds were identified. An\nODC team sorted through all of the possible altemate solutions to\nthe required changes and developed a plan to eliminate all ODCs\nfrom the process.\n\n0\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13" 32\nUse No.\n\nA0397534\n\nFig. 3.

NASA\na7dThiokolengineers beganan mdustry survey to identify options\nand alternative processes. Over a twc+year penod. 31 different\ncompanies were surveyed todetermine how they were responding\nto the production phaseout of TCA. Forty-nine technical papers\npresented at seminars, workshops. and NASA-sponsored working groups were evaluared. Data were summarized and a report\nwas published in March of 1993. A matrix was prepared listing the\nsubstrates,preferrcdcleaners. an4 the person leadingthe project at\neach company. A distribution analysis was made of usage for\ncleaners selected by two or more organizations. From this survey,\na list of factors to consider in the selection of replacement solvents\nand cleaners was created:\nIndustrial safety considerations\nFlammability, toxicity. allowable exposure\nEnvironmental release requirements\nOzone-depleting and global-warming potential. volatile organic compound level\nProduct safety\nCleaning effectivity as measured by bond test\nresults. residue on substrate, effect on metallurgical properties. material compatibility, corrosion potential, shelf-life (aging) capability\nCleaning efficiency\nMaterial and labor cost. availability, evaporation rate, soil loading capacity. stability. recyclability. d~sposal\ncost. energy cost, versatility\nCapital investment\nFloor space required. capital expenditures,estimated life-cycle cost for equipment\n\nwith five of th: best cleaners from each group: five aqueous. five\nsemiaqueous.and five organic-or 15total-beforc a finaldownselection of the two best cleaners was ma&. Both an aqueous andr\nsemiaqueous cleaner produced bonds that demonstrated superior\nfracture toughness and tensile adhesion test data, with acceptabk\nresults in all other areas tested. A typical set of data for steel tensile\nadhesion strength is shown in Fig. 5.\n\n8\n\n8\n\nTHE MAIN CONCLUSION OF THE INDUSTRY SURVEY WAS\nTHAT WHILE MUCH CAN BE LEARNED FROM OTHER\nCOMMNIES\' EXPERtENCES AND DATA.

Dr. Katy Wolf. the executive director\nof the Institutefor Research and Technical Assistance (IRTA). was\nvery helpful in suggesting that companies follow her low-risk\nhierarchy of alternate cleaners, i.e.. no clean, water, aqueous,\nsemiaqueous, combustible solvents, and flammable solvents in\ndecreasing order of desirability\n\n5. ANALYZE DATA-PRELlMINARY TEST PROGRAM\nIn the early stages of selecting a replacement cleaner for TCA at\nThiokol, all potential cleaners were considered. Idtial screening\ntests favored organic cleaners becausethe hardware\'s preservative\ngrease is soluble in organic cleaners. If all aqueous cleaners had\nbeen eliminatedbecause the greasepreservative was not soluble in\nthem. the best cleaners would have been missed as measured by\nfracture energy. tensile adhesion, and residue after final rinse.\nFortunately, the test program was structured to continue testing\n\nWlthout Grtl Blast\nA03975361\n\nWlth Grtl Blast\n\nFig. 5.

Components for the\nhigh-pressure water wash system are in the procurement cycle.\nThe Step 2development and qualificationeffort iscor~tinuing\nwith\nthe selection of a final cleaner to be made by mid-1994. The\ndesigningof the spray-in-arr system will begin in Octobcrof 1994\nand will beoperation-\'bj early 19%. At thattime.TCA usage will\nhave been reduced by 90percmt from 1989levels andTCA anissions by 95 percent.\n\nTABES 94-502\n- -\n\nConwrvltkn\n\nAll Schedub Am Mt\ne\nand Essential Urn\nExmptlon Omntml\n\nM397UcB\n\nFig. 6. Master Schedule for Replacement of ODC\nPhase 11--Eliminate Remaining 10 P e m n t of TCA,\nStockpile, and Obtain Essential Use Waiver\nThe Phase 1 plan eliminates the remaining 10 percent of TCA\n1\nusage by the end of 1999. Critical uses of TCA associated with\nhand cleaning. rubber activation, and equipment cleaning that\ncould affect critical bonds and processes essential in propellant\nmix and cast areas where a flash fire could be catastrophic are\nincluded in Phase U. The rernaming 10 percent TC\'A use affects\napproximately 80 percent of the bonds (78 of the 101) critical to\nthe reliabilityof the Space Shuttle system. An approach was established to request an Essential Use Exemption from the Solvents,\nCoatings, and Adhesives Technical Options Committee of the\nUnited Nations Environmental Program. This approach would\nallow time to address schedule and cost toensurechangescould be\nqualified prior to useon flight motors. Discussrons were held with\nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),NASA, andThiokol\nregarding the approach, and positive indications were received.\nThe Montreal Protocol criteria for an exemption were obtained.\nand a final request to purchase 125.000 pounds of TCA per year\nwas submitted to the EPA on June 24, 1993. The United Nations\ncommittee met in October of 1993 and reviewed the exemption\nrequest with final decision on the exemption to be made in the fall\nof 1994. If the exemption request is approved and scbeduies ar?\nmet. we will not require stockpiling of TCA (Fig. 7).\n\nCreative Synthesis of New Resources\nTheexecutron of our plans rnvolved a bringing-together of a number of nem resources: 1) new partnershrps. 2) new te~hnologies.\nand 3) new approaches and strategies.\nNew Partnerships. Ou;efforts benefitted greatly from the new\npartnerships fonned with governmental organizations, professional groups, indushy associations. and academia.\na. NASA Operational EnvironmentalTeam\nThe NASA Operational Environmental Team (NOET) was\nestablished in April 1992 to provide the entire NASA team a\ncentral resource to pursue replacement technology. The focus\nof this team is environmentally questionable materials and\nrelated processes involved in the design, development, test.\nand manufactureof NASA hardware.

Johnson Space Center (JSC) and MSFC provided\nfunding to allow Thioko~ conduct testing of alternate hardto\nware preservation and shipprng techniques at the refurbishment facility. The Assured Shunlc Availability (ASA) program demonstratd a process flow that eliminated the need for\nthe three vapor degrease cycles and proved preservative\ngrease is not required if the hardware is protected from the\nweather and high humidity conditions (less than 45 percent\nrelative humidity ).

Higb&ssure Water Wash\nThiokol has used high-pressure water systems in the 1 0 . W\nto IS.OO&psi range to remove insulation fnnn metal pans\nsince the mid-1960s. A new applicationof ultrahigh-pressure\nwater up to 36,000psi is planned as a replacement process for\nTCA vapor degreking and grit blast with zirconium silicate.\nThis environmentally superior process will eleminate TCA\nuse, reduce process cycle times, and increase hardware life\nbecause metal removal rates with water arc an order of magintude less than with grit blast media. \'Ibis equipment is being\ndemonstrated in the NASA Technology and Roductivity Enhancement Laboratory at MSFC.Reduction equipment is on\norder and is scheduled for installation and checkout during the\nfirst quarter of 1995. A sketch of the new equipment is shown\nin Fig. 9.\n\nFig. 8. RSRM Case Shipping System\nODC Phase Zero\nd. NASA Headquarters (Environmental Engineering)\nThe Chief Environmental Engineering Office at the Office of\nSpace Flight (OSF), NASA Headquarters. has taken an\naggressiveapproach to protecting theenvironment. This small\nstaff has opened channels of communication between the\nEPA. NASA, and contractors to provide the free exchange of\ninformation. Mr. Steven Newman is OSF\'s chief environmental engineer.\ne. Aerocpace Industr~es\nAssoc~at~on\nTh~okolCorporat~on.asa\nmember of the A-rospace Indusmes\nAssociation (AIA), has participatedon the Environmental Acrivities Committee. Members include the major air frame\nmanufacturersand their suppliers. the solid rocket motor manufacturers. and other aerospace organizations. Meetings have\nprovided valuable contacts with knowledgeable senior experts where information is exchanged in many areas of environmental concern. Mr. Glynn Rountree is the AIA chairman\nof this committee.\n\nt Academia\nBr~ghamYoung Un~versity was glver! a study cdntract to\nevaluate improved shipping and preservation methods.

The principal investigators on this study are Mr. Roy Mam of Thiokol and Dr.\nGary Workman of University of Alabama at Huntsville.\n\nNew Technologies.The team implementedplans for solvingenvironmental problems. We benefitted from the application of new\ntechnologies and provided additional processing benefits. Some\nof those arc described below.\n\nFig. 9. Ultrahigh-pressure Water Wash System\nb. Spray-m-Air With Aqueous and Semiaqueous\nCleaners\nAqueous and semiaqueouscleaners had been used in dip tanks\nfollowed by a rmse and drying of the mled part. Thiokol\nproposed using a \\pray-ln-a~r method that would be cheaper\nand glve a cleaner pan. Data gathered are shown in Fig. 5.\nc. Low-Emission Vapor Degreasing\nThe first consideration in finding a replacement for TCA used\nin the vapor degreasers was to evaluate a switch to perchlore\nethylene. It does pose health risks, and, therefore, has a low (50\nppm) permissible exposure limit. An alternative to o p e ~ o p\nvapordegreasers is an airtight system known as low-cmission\nvapor degreasers (LEVDs). Two manufacturers were contacted and several meetings held to understand how the LEVD\nsystem works. The process was determined to be a viable\nalternative, but was not selected because of relatively little\ndemonstrated use in US.industry on parts the size of RSRM\ncases. Also, the potential for future legislation on exposure\nand use of perchloroethylene was a concern. Thc two leading\nsuppliersofthisequipment are DUrr Industries,Inc., and Bamn\nBlakeslet.\n\nTABES 94-502\nSurface Cleanliness Measurements\nThe question of "How clean is clean?" has been with us for a\nlong time. Much has been accomplished to quantify the measure of cleanliness. NASA developed an optically stimulated\nelectron emission (OSEE) device called ConScan that measures surface cleanliness levels and oxides and plots them for\nacceptance analyr*is.\n\'3iokol has been using the system since\n1988toensureacceptable surfacecleanliness prior to bonding\nandcoatinued reliab~lity motor performance. The principle\nof\ncontact at NASAWSFC is Mr. Billy Nerren. TheThiokol-developed SurfMapTM\ninfrared contamination detection device\nusesdiffuse. back-scattered light in the mid-infrared region to\nmonitor a surface for the presence of hydrocarbons. The contact at Thiokol is Mark Walker.\nSurface Chemistry Analysis\nThiokol has made extensive use of laboratory surface chemical analysismethods in the evaluationof replacement cleaning\nof\nprocesses for methyl chloroform vapordegreas~ng steel and\naluminum bonding surfaces. Techniques include electron\nspectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). auger electron\nspectroscopy (AES), and static secondary ion mass spectrometry (static SIMs). ESCA, AES, and static SIMS are sensitive\nto changes in the topmost atomic layers of a surface which are\ndirectly ~nvolvedin bonding. The principal investigator at\nThiokol is Dr. Mike Lesley.\nNew Approache*and Strategies\na. Pollution Prrvent~on\nThe 1990s approach to enhancing the environment is prsventing pollut~on the source by better. smarter planni,~~ the\nat\noT\nproduct design and the manufacturing process. The EPA h3s\npublished a document (Facilih. Pollution Pmrntion Guide.\nEPA/600/R-92 088) May 1992. that provides excellent instructionson how to establish and maintain a successful pollution prevention program. The document may be obtained\nfrom: U.S. EPA, OMce Research & Development, Washington. D.C. 02460.\n\nreserved for use just prior to bonding operations at the Manufactunng work center. High-pressure water could remove\npaint and adhesive residue faster and better thm the existing\ngrit blast process. The life of the flight hardware could be\nextended with the h~gh-pressurewater wash because less metal would be removed than with grit blast. The change to ultrahigh-pressure cleaning at the Refurbishment Centa was accepted and eventually proved to be the best plan, once again\ndemonstrating that "the user knows more about the real pmcess than anybody else."\n7. REPORT SOLUTION O F PROBLEM\nAn engineering and environmentalchallenge was presented to the\nNASAmiokoVindustry team when the international dec~sion\nwas made to stop the production of ODCs. The team used aclassical approach for problem-solving combined with a creative\nsynthesis of new approaches to attack the challenge.\nSummary of Lessons Learned\nEstablishingclear selection criteria for daisions at\nthe beg~nning\nkeeps the program on m k\nIndustrial safety considerations must be evaluated\nwhen selecting alternate cleaners\nExamination of current process and minor changes\nreduced TCA useage by 50 percent\nbond strengths depend on cleanliness and surface\nchemistry\nListening to the people who will have to ~mplement\nthe plan improves results\nCost considerat~ons important and can be a posiare\nw e competition factor\nWhile much information can be learned from other\ncompanies\' experience. each company must tailor\nthe cleaning procesb to the part~cular\\ o h . wb\\trates and performance requirements of the product being manufactured\n\nCONCLUSION\nMost large organizat~ons\nhave a cupply system that Issues\nmaterials to the production line.

If the smallest unit of issue is a gallon and the user only\nneeds a pint, the result is scrap material, which is wasteful and\nexpensive to dispose of. By understanding the needs of the\nproduction line, material can be issued in quantities actually\nused, avoiding waste and expense.\nc. Listen to the User\nA significant change in direction occurred in kcember of\n1992 when Manufacturing Center directors responsible for\nthe cleaning operations made several suggestions that completely changed the direction of the ODC replacement prowarn. They suggested that high-pressure water be used for\nrefurbishment operations and the final precision cleaning be\n\nS~nce\nmany of the proces\\e\\ that were ~cceptabkIn the early\n1980s are no longer environmentally acceptable In the 1990s.\ncompanies need to make drastic changes to their thinking, materials, processes, and manufacturing in order to stay competitive.\nCompanies are basically concerned with how to get the best environmental program while under tight budget constraints. Mating\nenvironmental requirements necessitates making changes to the\nway products are manufactured. The requirement to make changes\nto processes can be an opportunity rather than a burden. Since all\ncompanies must make changes at this time, leaders can make\nchanges in a manner that will give them a competitive edge. They\nhave an opportunity to examine their manufacturing paradigms\nand incorporate better ones. New cleaning methods should make\noperations more economical where possible. These new environmental requirementsgive companies an opportunity to m o d c m k\nwhile making the workplace safer and reducing emissions of hazardous materials.\n\n'
