b'National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nLETS\n\nLunar Environments Test System\ny\n\nIntroduction\nJason Vaughn\nTodd Schneider\nPaul Craven\nJoey Norwood\nEnvironmental Effects Branch\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nHuntsville, AL 35812\n\nThe Environmental Effects Branch\n(EM50) at the Marshall Space Flight\nCenter has developed a unique\ncapability within the agency, namely the\nLunar Environment Test System\n(LETS).\nLETS is a cryo-pumped\nvacuum chamber facility capable of\nhigh vacuum (10-7 Torr). LETS is a\ncylindrical chamber, 30 in. (0.8 m)\ndiameter by\n48 in. (1.2 m) long\nthermally controlled vacuum system.\nThe chamber is equipped with a full\narray of radiation sources including\nvacuum ultraviolet, electron, and proton\nradiation. The unique feature of LETS\nis that it contains a large lunar simulant\nbed (18 in. x 40 in. x 6 in.) holding 75\nkg of JSC-1a simulant while operating\nat a vacuum of 10-7 Torr. The radiation\nsources have\n\nCapabilities\n\nthree applications; 1) to study the\ncharging, levitation and migration of\ndust particles, 2) to simulate the\nradiation environment on the lunar\nsurface, and 3) to electrically charge\nthe lunar simulant enhancing the\nattraction and adhesion of dust\nparticles to test articles more closely\nsimulating the lunar surface dust\nenvironment.\nLETS has numerous\ndiagnostic instruments including TREK\nelectrostatic probes, residual gas\nanalyzer (RGA), temperature controlled\nquartz crystal microbalance (TQCM),\nand particle imaging velocimeter (PIV).\nFinally, LETS uses continuous Labview\ndata\nacquisition\nfor\ncomputer\nmonitoring and system control.\n\nLunar Environment\n\nPlanned LETS Capability\n\nHigh Vacuum\n\nCryo-pumped vacuum chamber with base\nCryo-pumped vacuum\nchamber with base pressure of pressure of 1 x 10-7 Torr\n1 x 10-7 Torr\n\nTemperature Range\n-150 \xc2\xb0C to +130 \xc2\xb0C\n\nLiquid nitrogen (LN2) cold\nSystem has quartz lamps installed and\nshroud (-190 \xc2\xb0C), quartz lamp demonstrated to +150 C.
