A multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO) environment defined the geometry that was further refined for the updated SUGAR High TBW configuration. Airfoil shapes were tested in the NASA TCT facility, and an aeroelastic model was tested in the NASA TDT facility. Flutter suppression was successfully demonstrated using control laws derived from test system ID data and analysis models. Aeroelastic impacts for the TBW design are manageable and smaller than assumed in Phase I. Flutter analysis of TBW designs need to include pre-load and large displacement non-linear effects to obtain a reasonable match to test data. With the updated performance and sizing, fuel burn and energy use is reduced by 54% compared to the SUGAR Free current technology Baseline (Goal 60%). Use of the unducted fan version of the engine reduces fuel burn and energy by 56% compared to the Baseline. Technology development roadmaps were updated, and an airport compatibility analysis established feasibility of a folding wing aircraft at existing airports.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150017036, "id": "73d347dfcb294b02ae136d5d60be3446", "publicationDate": "2015-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20150017040, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research: Phase II- Volume III-Truss Braced Wing Aeroelastic Test Report", "stiType": "CONTRACTOR_REPORT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20150017039, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research: Phase 2", "stiType": "CONTRACTOR_REPORT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150017036.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150017036/downloads/20150017036.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150017036/downloads/20150017036.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150017036/downloads/20150017036.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
