Has pendulum that swings comb into closed position when container turned on side. Suspended with axis of rotation perpendicular to axes of combs. Extends through D-shaped cam ring, attached to upper comb with standoff struts. When container tilted sideways, pendulum swings along arc side of D-shaped ring. Forces cam ring aside, moving upper comb toward closed position. If container tilted forward or backward, pendulum does not interfere with comb movement. Spring catches added to combs so if actuated and close container opening, they lock in place to prevent further tampering.", "title": "Tamper-Resistant Secure Disposal Container", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T03:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890000521, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Collins, Earl R., Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "Caltech"}}, "id": "97c95d9f805b45f9a9a6b67203bb2189"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - NASA Tech Brief", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890000521, "publications": [{"volume": "13", "submissionId": 19890000521, "issue": "10", "issn": "0145-319X", "id": "7fe7d9716dfb42aea34cd712e8882a0d", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs", "publicationDate": "1989-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
