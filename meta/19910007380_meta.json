Advanced turboprops generate low-frequency, periodic noise signatures at relatively high levels. As demonstrated in a flight test of NASA Lewis Research Center's Propfan Test Assessment (PTA) airplane in Alabama in October 1987, the noise of an advanced turboprop operating at cruise altitudes can be audible on the ground. The assessment of the en route noise issue is difficult due to the variability in received noise levels caused by atmospheric propagation and the uncertainty in predicting community response to the relatively low-level en route noise, as compared to noise associated with airport operations. The En Route Noise Test was designed to address the atmospheric propagation of advanced turboprop noise from cruise altitudes and consisted of measuring the noise of an advance turboprop at cruise in close proximity to the turboprop and on the ground. Measured and predicted ground noise levels are presented.", "title": "Long-range vertical propagation", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910007380, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Willshire, William L., Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA., United States"}}, "id": "2d63adcdb4044b55a1c92f926fa30153"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910007380, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Garber, Donald P."}, "organization": {"name": "Lockheed Engineering and Sciences Co.", "location": "Hampton, VA., United States"}}, "id": "8dbf26e3530542698e81cbcb1824db8b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910007380, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910007380, "id": "44d2e0f1039c4fa08eea752d3317ee0e", "publicationName": "4th International Symposium on Long-Range Sound Propagation", "publicationDate": "1990-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910007380.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910007380/downloads/19910007380.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910007380/downloads/19910007380.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910007380/downloads/19910007380.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
