Astronauts returning from space flight exhibit impaired\nability to coordinate effective landing strategies when jumping from a platform to the ground. This study compares\njump strategies used by astronauts before and after flight, changes to those strategies within a test session, and\nrecoveries in jump-down performance parameters across several postflight test sessions. These data were obtained as\npart of an ongoing interdisciplinary study (Functional Task Test, FTT) designed to evaluate both astronaut postflight\nfunctional performance and related physiological changes.\nMETHODS\nSeven astronauts from short-duration (Shuttle) and three from long-duration (International Space Station) flights\nperformed 3 two-footed jumps from a platform 30 cm high onto a force plate that measured the ground reaction\nforces and center-of-pressure displacement from the landings. Neuromuscular activation data were collected from\nthe medial gastrocnemius and anterior tibialis of both legs using surface electromyography electrodes. Two load\ncells in the platform measured the load exerted by each foot during the takeoff phase of the jump. Data were\ncollected in 2 preflight sessions, on landing day (Shuttle only), and 1, 6, and 30 days after flight.\nRESULTS\nPostural settling time was significantly increased on the first postflight test session and many of the astronauts tested\nwere unable to maintain balance on their first jump landing but recovered by the third jump, showing a learning\nprogression in which performance improvements could be attributed to adjustments in takeoff or landing strategy.\nJump strategy changes were evident in reduced air time (time between takeoff and landing) and also in increased\nasymmetry in foot latencies on takeoff.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe test results revealed significant decrements in astronauts\xe2\x80\x99 abilities to maintain balance and achieve a postural\nstability upon landing from a jump early after flight. However, the jump landing adaptation process often begins\nafter the first jump with full recovery of most performance parameters within days after space flight. As expected,\nperformance of ISS astronauts on the first day after flight was similar to that of Shuttle crewmembers on landing\nday.\n\n'
