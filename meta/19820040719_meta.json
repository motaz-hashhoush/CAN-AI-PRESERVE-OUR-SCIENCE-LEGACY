Seasonal variations in thermospheric temperature and composition are explained by energy and mass transport from the summer to the winter hemisphere induced by preferential heating, with the winter oxygen bulge participating in a feedback mechanism which acts to dampen wind velocities and increase temperature contrast. Changes in the eddy diffusion coefficient are considered as a complementary mechanism of producing the seasonal anomalies. The role of winds induced by high-latitude heating by particles and Joule dissipation during magnetic storms and substorms in accounting for thermospheric density increases and N2 and Ar enhancements and O and He depletions at high latitudes are discussed, and the rather weak compositional signature of E x B momentum coupling is distinguished from the effects of Joule dissipation.", "title": "Wind induced composition effects at high latitudes", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T20:35:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820040719, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mayr, H.
