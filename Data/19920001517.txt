Kirby, USGS, Menlo\n\nPark, CA 94025;\n\nFrozen volatiles make up an important volume fraction of the low-density\nmoons of the outer solar\nsystem.\nUnderstanding the tectonic history of the surfaces of these moons, as well as the evolution of their\ninteriors, requires knowledge of the mechanical\nstrength of these icy materials under the appropriate planetary conditions\n(temperature,\nhydrostatic\npressure, swain rate).\nWe are conducting\nongoing laboratory\nresearch to measure mechanical properties of several different ices under conditions that faithfully reproduce\nconditions both at the moons\'\nsurfaces (generally\nlow temperature, to about 100 K, and low pressures) and\nin the deep interiors (wanner temperatures,\npressures to thousands of atmospheres).\nWe report here recent\nprogress in two different phases of our work: rheology of ices in the NH3-H20\nsystem at temperatures\nand\nstrain rates lower than we have ever before explored, with application to the ammonia-rich\nmoons of Saturn\nand Uranus; and the water ice I--->II phase transformation, whmh not only applies directly to process deep in\nthe interiors of Ganymede and Callisto, but holds implications fox deep terrestrial\nearthquakes as well.\nRheology of NH_-HzO Ices to T=130 K. The NH 3 proportion of condensed\nvolatiles on icy moons,\ntaken as a bulk average, may be as high as 0.15 of the H20 mass fraction (1). Natural refinement, especially through extraction of partial melts, can increase this fraction to that of the pure ammonia dihydrate\n(NH3-2H20) composition,\nabout 0.29. We have carried out in the laboratory mechanical tests on samples of\nammonia-water\nmixtures in the compositional\nrange 0 to 29 wt. % NI-I3, at temperatures\nfrom above the peritectic melting temperature (176 K) to as low as 130 K, at confining pressures of 50 and 100 MPa and at\nstrain rates from 3.5 \xc3\x97 10-_ to 3.5 \xc3\x97 10-7 s-1 (Fig. 1). Our ability to deform at strain rates of 3.5 \xc3\x97 10 -7 s -1,\nand thus induce ductile flow at T<145 K without brittle failure, is the result of a recent hardware change\nthat improved our low strain rate limit by an order of magnitude.\nThe new results (Fig. la) confirm an effect suggested by the trend of earlier results (Fig. lb): even\nthough ammonia\ndihydrate melts at 176 K, its strength is more temperature-sensitive\nthan that of water ice,\nso that below about 135 K it is slightly stronger than water ice. Not surprisingly, mixtures of water ice and\nammonia dihydrate are also stronger than water ice at these temperatures.\nThis behavior\nhas important\nimplications\nfor icy moons in cooler parts of the solar system.\nNear-surface ductility seen on the smaller\nmoons of Saturn and Uranus will be more difficult to rationalize\non the basis of ammonia-water.\nOn the\nother hand, the range of viscosities that can be reached with relatively small (40 K) temperature changes in\nNH3-H20\nmixtures may prove to be a convenience\nin explaining complex features on Triton.\nIce I--->II and Deep Earthquakes.\nOur work on the inelastic deformation behavior of H20 ices has provided the first systematm exploration of the fracture and plastic flow under planetary conditions\n(pressures\nup to 0.6 GPa and temperatures\nfrom 77 to 256 K (2)). In the course of carrying out this experimental\nprogram, we discovered\nan unusual form of faulting that has relevance\nfor deep (360-690\nkin) earthquakes\nfaulting on Earth and that may imply similar deep faulting on Ganymede and other large icy bodies in the\n.solar system.\nThe faulting instabihty\nin ice has several unusual properties: faulting slrength does not\nincrease with increasing pressure, a transition to ductile behavior\ndoes not occur with increasing\nconfining\npressure, and faults form in the maximum\nshear stress orientation (45 \xc2\xb0 ) to compression.\nThese events are\nrestricted\nto low temperatures\nand elevated pressures.\nClose thermodynamic\nparallels exist between the ice\ntransformation\nand those that occur in the ferromagnesian\nphases (olivine and the spinel structures)\nof the\nearth\'s upper mantle, and the transformation\nkinetics in both transformations\nare slow. Thus the faulting\ninstability\ncan occur in the ice 11 stability field where ice I persists metastably at low temperatures\nand\nelevated\npressures,\nand the cold thermal structure of the descending\nlithospheric\nslab in some subduction\nzones may be favorable for the faulting instability to develop in metastable\nolivine, as explained below.\nThere are two distinct manifestations\nof the transformation\nunder nonhydrostatic\nstress (Fig. 2). The\nfirst, which we call transformational\nfaulting,\nis the unusual faulting we described\nabove.\nXray diffraction\nreveals small amounts of ice II in such faulted samples, and we have suggested (4) that the large volumetric\nstrain and exothermic\ncharacter\nof the ice I--_II transformation\nare the destabilizing\nfactors that cause the\nfaulting.\nThe second manifestation\nis a bulk transformation\nthat occurs at warmer\ntemperatures\n(above\nabout 175 K) where ice II nucleates at a few points in our 30-cm3-volume\nsample and grows in a slow and\ncontrolled\nmanner.\nGreen and colleagues\n(5,6) have confirmed\nolivine-spinel\ntransformations\nin Mg2GeO 4 and\nmechanism\nby which transformational\nfaults may\nspinel phase.\nWe recently have followed\nup on\nrefining the faulting strength data, confirming the\nimportance of earlier work by Goto et al. (8) that\nsubducting lithosphere can also give rise to large\ntional faulting.\n\nour hypothesis\nin observing transformational\nfaulting in\nin silicate olivine\nand have also identified a possible\nbe nucleated by the interactions\nof microinclusions\nof the\nour earlier work on transformational\nfaulting in ice (7),\nfault nucleation hypothesis of Green, and pointing out the\nthe volume changes involved in phase transformations in\nregional deviatoric stresses that can stimulate wansforma-\n\nWe think deep earthquakes\noccur because the reconstructive\nphase transition olivine-->spinel\ncally retarded for millions of years and hundreds of kilometers depth as a slab of cool lithosphere\ninto the mantle.\nWhen the transformation\nfinally does occur, and we suggest it occurs progressively\n\n17\n\nis kinetidescends\nfrom\n\nT,K\n150\n\n,\n,\n\n; i ! i\nI i i\ni\ni !

Strength of water ice and ammonia\ndihydrate clearly are\ncomparable\nat 130 K, but the results are confused by an unexpected shear instability in the ammonia samples and\nby unusual swain-dependent effects in water ice (the two open circles near 135 K are clearly distinc0.\n\n18\n\nyvl\n\nTrlnsfonnstlon\nhaultlng\n,.\n\n",\n\n350,\n\n\\ ".\n\\_\n\'....\n\nn\nets 3OO\n\no "\\\n[]\nIce !I stable\nn"\n\n,_\n\n+ .......

Phase diagram for ice and hydrostatic conditions of the experiments.\nWhen ice I is\npressurized into the ice II stability field, it does not transform to ice II at the equilibrium boundary. Under hydrostatic conditions (solid boxes), the overpressurization\nrequired to cause the\ntransformation\nto initiate increases sharply as temperature decreases\n(dotted line).\nThe bulk\ntransformation pressure can be lowered if a differential stress is superimposed\non the hydrostatic\npressure (crosses).\nThe differential stress required for bulk transformation at any temperature\nis\nsimply the difference\nbetween the actual pressure (crosses) and the hydrostatic\nlimit (dotted\nline); in other words, the criterion for transformation is a maximum normal stress. At lower\ntemperatures\nand pressures there seems to be a limit on the maximum differential stress that can\nbe applied, illustrated by the open boxes.\nAbove a shear stress that is weakly temperature sensitive (not shown: about 85 MPa at 77 K, descending to 53 MPa at 170 K) samples fail by\nmacroscopic\nfaulting.\nThe process involves transformation\nof small amounts of ice I to ice II;\nhence it is termed transformational\nfaulting, and may be an analog for deep earthquakes in the\nearth.\nSuch faulting may occur at depths of 40 - 200 km on the large icy moons.\n\nthe outer boundaries\nof the slab inwards as the slab slowly heats up, the negative\nvolume change of the\ntransformation\nleaves the remaining wedge-shaped\ncore of olivine in a state of slab-parallel\ncompression\n(8).\nStresses eventually\nrise to the point where transformational\nfaulting, the process we observe in ice in the\nlaboratory,\noccurs within the olivine wedge, and a deep earthquake\nis registered\nseismically.\nThis unified hypothesis of deep terrestrial earthquakes has implications\nfor deep moonquakes\non large,\ntectonically\nactive icy bodies such as an early Ganymede.\nA key requirement\nis that conditions\nof metastability be present for polymorphic\ntransformations\nthat are strongly exothermic\nand involve\nlarge volume\nchanges (e.g., ice I---_II). Earth-style\nplate tectonics evidently did not occur on Ganymede,\nbut planetary_1o e endogenic\nprocesses\n(mostly tensile) certainly did, and some of them could have driven blocks of ice I\nw its equilibrium\nboundary.\nSome downward\nmotion of crust is implied by the extensive resurfacing\nof\nGanymede,\nfor instance by blocks of silicate-laden\nice I that have foundered\nor descended\nin graben formations. These conditions\nmight also be met during cooling at constant depth and pressure.\nReferences\n(1) Prinn and Fegley (1981) Astrophys.\nJ. 249, 308-317.\n(2) Durham et al. (1983) J. Geophys.
