In the conventional photograph you see\na two-dimensional image, although the illusion of\ndepth, form, and shape has been achieved through\nimaginative lighting of the statue. If the lighting were\nflat, the statue would look more like a photograph of\na drawing than a three-dimensional object with shape\nand form.\nNow imagine that the frame to your right is\nuncovered. The transparency in the frame is a\n"hologram" and could be illuminated from the rear\nby either a conventional incandescent light source or\na source of coherent (in-phase) light such as a laser.\nUsing conventional light, the hologram appears to\nhave a featureless cast with no discernible image.\nHowever, selecting the proper coherent light source\nreveals an exact replica of the original "La Pieta"\ninstead. This image is truly three-dimensional, because each eye sees the statue\'s image through a\ndifferent area of the hologram and thus perceives it\nfrom a different aspect. As your head and eyes move,\nthe image changes in perspective, exactly as the\noriginal statue would appear to an observer moving\nabout and looking through a window the same size as\nthe frame.\nIf you were to cut the conventional photograph of\n"La Pieta" in half, you would of course see only half\nan image. With the hologram, however, you could still\nsee the entire statue, although with some loss in\nresolution.\nBoth the human eye and camera film as normally\nexposed through a lens record only intensity; the\nhologram records the phase information in the wave\nas well. The eye lets us see form because each eye\nperceives a slightly different image and the brain acts\nas a computer to report the differences as depth; in a\n\nphotograph, whatever effect of depth is created is due\nto lighting techniques, and flat lighting gives photographs that are relatively featureless. The hologram,\non the other hand, because it supplies phase information as well as the intensity, gives true depth\nperception in three dimensions.\nThe three-dimensional and image redundancy\ncharacteristics of the hologram are but two of its\nfascinating aspects. Contemporary holographic\ntechniques for recording and viewing objects are\nrevolutionizing many engineering, production, and\ndisplay problems.\nFIELDS FOR HOLOGRAPHIC\nAPPLICATIONS\n\nThese current and potential holographic applications can be of value in the following fields:\nLaw Enforcement and Crime Prevention\nBanking and Economic Control\nFood Production, Processing, and Distribution\nWearing Apparel and Household Furnishings\nCommunications, Data Processing, and Transfer\nEducation and Welfare\nTransportation\nEntertainment, Recreation, and Advertising\nBuilding and Construction\nManufacturing and Instrumentation\nBusiness and Services\nMedicine and Public Health\nChemical Industry, Drugs, and Plastics\nResource Maintenance and Management\nAerospace Exploration and Utilization\nDefense\nThe three-dimensional effect aroused a flurry of\ninterest in the potential of three-dimensional movies\nand other forms of mass entertainment in the 1960\'s.\nThe problems and some of the attempts to overcome\nthem are discussed in chapter 7. Other uses based on\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\nthe phenomenon are widespread, and some are\ncommercial. For example, it is possible to detect\nstresses or deformation in machine parts or printed\ncircuits, or to detect flaws in integrated circuitry. The\nmethod has even been studied for possible use in a\nmemory system for off-track betting.\nHolographic techniques make it possible to store a\nlarge amount of information in a small space, 200\ntimes as much as microfilm or microfiche, and to read\nit back at higher rates of speed. More than one image\ncan be recorded on a single film area and read back\nwith minimal cross-talk. The information stored, both\nin density of storage and speed of readout, is higher\nthan that needed by present computers or library\nstorage systems. Holography should lead to even\nfaster computers and help solve the problem of what\nto do with the mass of material pouring into our\nlibraries.\nA holographic record of a fingerprint on a card\ncannot be identified as a fingerprint by visual means,\nbut the hologram can be compared with the individual\'s print for identification purposes. Such\nsecurity equipment has already been designed. A\nfurther step is to "scramble" the hologram according\nto a code pattern so that unique equipment must be\nused to reconstruct the fingerprint record.\nThe principles of holography have been applied to\nother types of wave systems, such as acoustic, radar\nand ultrasonic systems. They offer promise in medicine as a noninvasive method for studying internal\nportions of the body. Tumors, for example, can be\ninvestigated by acoustic techniques.\nA holographic technique has been used for "image\ndeblurring"\xe2\x80\x94improving the readability of unsharp\nimages. This is akin to noise reduction after the fact,\nalthough holograms give high signal-to-noise ratios.\nFor several years, holographic techniques have\nbeen used to map terrain with radar waves, and also\nhave applications in earth surveillance for agriculture,\nforestry, and urban problems.\nOne of the problems with honeycomb structural\nmaterials that combine strength with low weight is\nthe bonding of the skin surfaces to the honeycomb\ncore. Laser holography provided an answer, since\ncomparison of an original hologram and one made\nafter the panel had been heated showed fringes\nindicating lack of bonding. A similar comparison\ndirectly and then under slight vacuum to cause a\nstress has been used to examine tires for trucks and\naircraft, and for recapping. Lack of bonding, breaks,\n\nor foreign particles can be observed. The method is\nrelatively rapid. The machine may find wider use as\nFederal requirements for tires become more restrictive. The acoustic holographic method used for soft\ntissues has also been applied to the examination of\nsteel blocks up to 19 in. thick. A holographic method\nfor measuring the thickness of films deposited on a\nsurface has been worked out and might be helpful in\nthe application of thin plastic coatings to containers\nwhere control of thickness is important.\nA number of possibilities for holography exist in\nparticle measurement and control. For example in\none method of removing sulfur compounds from the\ngases in coal-fired boilers, a cloud of pulverized\nlimestone is blown into the chamber. The uniformity\nof this cloud, and hence its effectiveness, can be\nstudied by holographic methods. Particle studies have\nbeen used for determining the droplet pattern in\ncarburetors, and might improve the common aerosol\nspray can process. There are also other spray\nprocesses where holographic information might be\nhelpful, including various types of industrial coating\nprocedures.\nBy holography of the retina of the eye, glaucoma\nand other difficulties can be determined, even in the\npresence of cataracts. Since the image is threedimensional, various layers can be studied from the\nhologram, which also provides a permanent record for\nlater reference.\nFor the training of astronauts, a method was\ndeveloped that caused the image to appear larger and\nnearer as the "approach" took place. Another\nmethod, developed to produce a ..wider angle of\ndisplay at the sacrifice of some spatial resolution, is\nbeing investigated as a system of air traffic display\nand control for the Federal Aviation Administration.\nA Visual Information Processing System uses\ncomputer-generated color output display. Laser\nsources capable of producing 5-micron size dots will\nbe used by the computer to read the holograms.\nThe advertising profession was not slow to\nrecognize the possibilities of the new method of\npresenting illustrative material. At the opening of a\nnew automotive building, a "display case" showed\nalternately the body of a new car and that of a\nNapoleonic coach, apparently filling the space. There\nwere four "windows," actually holograms, so a\nspectator could walk completely around the exhibit.\nFrom time to time, the space was illuminated with\ndiffused light to show that it was actually empty.\n\nINTRODUCTION TO HOLOGRAPHY\nHolography is part of a system being developed for\nproducing a two-dimensional color TV program from\na tape for home viewing. A relief type hologram is\nused as a master tape, and the final tape is embossed\nfrom the master. The resulting tape is resistant to the\neffects of scratches. It is expected to sell for about $3\nand the playback unit may sell for about as much as a\ncolor TV set.\nA holographic camera developed for moon studies\nis rugged enough for earth service as well. It has\nshown a capability for microscopy of the holographic\nimage throughout the working space; hence a single\nexposure will give far more information than will a\nphotograph through a conventional microscope. A\ncommercial holographic microscope has been\ndeveloped that can make a series of exposures\nshowing, for example, crystal growth, bacterial\nmovement, and other surface changes under various\nconditions.\nA major practical application of holography began\nwith the discovery that two or more holographic\nimages could be compared precisely by simply superimposing them by one of many methods. The same\nfilm may be used for both, or separate films\nemployed, or the holographic image superimposed on\nan actual object. A study of this type has led to a\n30-percent improvement in the intensity of a xenon\narc lamp. The principle has also been used in\nevaluating the contours of a 9-ft-diam microwave\nantenna to an accuracy of 0.001 in.\nIt is clear that holograms, properly spaced in time\ncould aid in studies of vibration and shock, both from\na theoretical and a commercial standpoint. Their use\navoids sensor problems characteristic of other\nmethods. One result has been a new theory for the\npremature failure of thin shells under a buckling\nstress. The method does not involve contact and\npermits the entire surface to be mapped at one time.\nFluid flow, fluid density, and fluid temperature\nmeasurement are other uses for holography, and do\nnot demand the insertion of probes that would\nchange the pattern.\nThese examples are all related to nondestructive\ntesting, a field where there are many uses for\nholography. Titanium welds, honeycomb structures,\nsolid rocket propellants, the formation of microcracks, and contamination by space particles are all of\ninterest to NASA and are being studied. Turbine\nblades designed for a jet engine were found to have a\nresonance in a dangerous range. Redesign, checked\n\nagain by holographic methods, avoided possible\nengine failure. Other engine parts are also tested with\nsuccessful results. Bearings are being checked at full\nspeeds by the Navy to reduce the possibility of\nservice failures.\nIf incipient cracks set up surface disturbance\npatterns, they can often be detected by holography.\nInitially invisible stress corrosion cracking in titanium\nwas investigated in this manner, and a radial crack\nfrom a saw cut was also shown. A different holographic technique was used in the study and development of a speaker cone to show the patterns at\ndifferent loadings and frequencies.\nMotion pictures of holograms have been made to\nshow fringe changes with time.\' Making threedimensional holographic movies has proved difficult\nexcept for specialized applications; proposed solutions are being explored and a movie producer has\nannounced that he will employ a patented process to\nmake a holographic movie using laser lighting. Television poses another problem because of the bandwidth\npresently needed for the information in a hologram.\nIf improved methods for movies can be worked out,\nthey may make television holography more likely.\nThe word "holography" was coined from the\nGreek words holos (whole) and grapho (to write) by\nits inventor, Dr. Dennis Gabor, Nobel Physics\nLaureate of 1971. It may be defined as the science\nand technique of recording (or otherwise using) all\nthe information content of waves transmitted, reflected, or scattered from objects. These objects can\nbe either stationary or moving in translation, rotation, or vibration.\nHolography is not restricted to specific classes of\nwaves. It can involve the entire spectrum of transverse\nelectromagnetic energy\xe2\x80\x94from long radio waves,\nthrough optical wavelengths, to x-ray wavelengths; as\nwell as the spectrum of longitudinal wave energy,\nfrom long wavelength seismic disturbances, through\nacoustic sonar waves, to the very short ultrasonic\nwavelengths.\nThe material that photographically records the\nwave information from a test object is called a\n"hologram." When such a hologram is properly\nilluminated, a three-dimensional image of the original\nobject can be formed or reconstructed: The entire\n, system forming the hologram and reconstructing the\nobject\'s image is called a "holographic system." The\nequipment used in forming the hologram is sometimes referred to as a "holocamera," and the process\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\nof image formation as "wavefront reconstruction." In\n1948 Dr. Gabor developed the underlying principles\nof holography into a comprehensive theory that the\namplitude and phase information of a reflected or\nscattered optical wave from an object could be\nrecorded by interaction or "interference" between\nthe object wave and a coherent background reference\nwave (ref. 1).\nIt might be useful at this point to reflect on the\ndifferences between holography and photography.\nPhotography is basically a method of recording only\nthe two-dimensional irradiance (or intensity) distribution of an image. Each "scene" consists of a large\nnumber of reflecting or radiating points of light, and\nthe waves from each of these elementary points all\ncontribute to a complete wave\xe2\x80\x94the "object" wave.\nThis complex wave is transformed (or focused) by the\noptical lens so that it collapses into an image of the\nradiating object, which is the image recorded on the\nphotographic emulsion. In holography, on the other\nhand, it is not the optically formed image which is\nrecorded, but the totality of object wave itself. This\nwave is recorded so that a subsequent illumination of\nthe record with the reference wave serves to reconstruct the original object wave, not just its intensity,\nand even in the absence of the original object. The\nobserver of this reconstructed wavefront sees an\nobject or scene that is practically indiscernible from\nthe original. Recording the object wave rather than\nthe object image constitutes the basic difference\nbetween holography and conventional photography.\nGabor\'s idea was limited by available light sources\nand lay dormant until 1962-1964, when Leith and\nUpatnieks (ref. 2) demonstrated that a coherent light\nbeam from a laser could be split to form both the\nobject and the reference beam, and that interference\nbetween the reference and the object wave (either\ntransmitted or reflected) from the subject could be\nrecorded on a photographic plate (hologram) to show\nboth its amplitude and phase.\nThis long delay between discovery of the theory\nand its experimental demonstration stemmed from\nthe inadequacy of light sources before the advent of\nthe laser. If successful "interference" is to occur\nbetween two traveling waves, the path difference\nbetween the two waves from their source to their\npoint of interaction must be less than or equal to the\ncoherence length of the wave radiation. The incoherent incandescent or arc light sources had very\nbroad spectral or color bandwidths; although they\n\ncould be filtered to a narrow, nearly monochromatic\nbandwidth, almost all their energy was lost in the\nprocess. Using these early sources, only very weak\nholograms with path differences in the order of\ntenths of millimeters were possible. The first heliumneon gas laser sources had coherence lengths of\nseveral centimeters, and gas lasers can now be\nconstructed with coherence lengths of hundreds of\nmeters. This allows path differences of meters, so that\nthe reference beam and object beam paths need not\nbe perfectly compensated in length. Thus, although\nthe laser made holography a practical reality, the type\nof laser used strongly affects holographic techniques.\nFor example the short coherence length of most\npulsed laser sources (compared to continuous wave\nlasers) still acts as a constraint on geometry when\npulsed lasers are used for holographic interferometry\nand photography.\nSURVEY APPROACH\n\nThis survey describes current and completed\nNASA efforts in holography, along with some background on other efforts to provide perspective on the\nentire field. Twelve areas or disciplines within holography are identified in table 1. Primarily these are\nfunctional categories\xe2\x80\x94engineering or scientific\napplications that can be satisfied through holographic\ntechniques\xe2\x80\x94but some are also related to the specific\ntechniques or to particular wavelengths used in\nforming holograms or holographic material.\n\nTABLE I.-Holography Categories Key\nDiscipline\nOptical Holographic Recording\nOptical Holographic Display\nOptical Holographic Microscopy\nOptical Holographic Interferometry\nOptical Motion Picture/Television\nHolography\nMicrowave Holography\nAcoustic and Ultrasonic Holography\nSeismic Holography\nHolographic Data Processing and Storage\nHolographic Data Processing and Pattern\nRecognition\nHolographic Optics\nComputer-Generated Holography\nSummary of State of the Art\n\nChapter key\nChapter 3\nChapter 4\nChapter 5\nChapter 6\nChapter 7\nChapter 8\nChapter 8\nChapter 8\nChapter 9\nChapter 9\nChapter 10\nChapter 10\nChapter 10\n\nINTRODUCTION TO HOLOGRAPHY\nChapter 2 presents additional information on\nsingle exposure holographic concepts; it explains how\na hologram works and some of the basic characteristics and classifications of holograms. Practical\ntechniques for producing holograms, and some of\ntheir limitations, are also included. Appendix A\ndescribes in detail how the hologram of a point,\ncalled a zone plate, can reconstruct itself, while\nappendix B offers a more rigorous elementary\nmathematical demonstration of the generation and\nreconstruction of various holographic images and of\nthe reciprocity of a hologram. Appendix C describes\nthe properties of several classes of holograms and\ndiscusses holographic performance parameters.\nAppendix D provides some detailed background for\nunderstanding holographic optical data processing\nand filtering.\nThe variety, of present and potential applications\nof holography is dealt with in chapters 3 through 9\n\nby the categories listed in table 1 (see the "chapter\nkey"). Chapter 10 contains a more detailed discussion\nof these discipline areas and a concise summary of the\nstate-of-the-art by discipline. Where necessary for\nbetter understanding, explanations of techniques and\nbackground also appear in the discussion of each\ndiscipline.\nNo separate chapter is included for holographic\noptics or computer-generated holography, but these\nareas are included in the holographic state-of-the-art\nchart (ch. 10) and in the applications summary\nmatrix (table 2). Although these areas have great\npotential, NASA has not been active in them and for\nthe most part they are in an early research and\ndevelopment phase (refs. 3 and 4). The discussion of\napplications and technology in subsequent chapters is\ngenerally in two main sections: NASA Research and\nDevelopment and Commercial Endeavors. Research\nand development applications include holographic\n\nTABLE 2. - APPLICATIONS SUMMARY MATRIX\n\nB Commercial System, Acclicat\n\xe2\x80\xa2 R&D Application\nPotential Application\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\ndevices, systems, or techniques that gather data not\nobtainable in any other way, or at least collect it\nmore effectively. In a few cases these have practical\nuses. Commercial endeavors include commercially\nmarketed devices available and developmental holographic devices or systems of proven industrial value.\nIncluded under both sections are some potential\napplications, techniques, and devices which have not\nyet demonstrated practical usefulness, but which\nshow real promise. Several of the commercial items\nare related to previous contract work done for NASA.\nTable 2 shows at a glance the scope of present\napplications and the projected use of a given holography discipline in each field of application. Because\nthe practical applications of this new technology are\nso recent, special emphasis is given in this survey to\npredicted or potential applications, documented by\nreferences on their initial experimental stages. Some\napplications have been suggested by extrapolation\nfrom reviews of current work. There is simply not\nenough experience in the field for a meaningful cost\nanalysis of commercial holography, although it seems\nclear that several corporations are saving money and\nmanpower by using holographic aircraft panel and jet\nengine testing and holographic contour mapping.\nThe interaction between each developed holographic discipline and the fields of application is\nshown by the three codes in table 2. Present\ncommercial holographic systems, devices, or equipment that are practical for a given application field\nare designated by a solid box. This category includes\nsystems developed through NASA that have led to\nimprovement in the design and operation of practical\ndevices. Current equipment in a research and development status which shows considerable promise of\ncommercial use is shown by a black dot, and\npotential applications of either present holographic\nR&D equipment or of holographic concepts, techniques, or methodology are shown by a star. The\nsource of each discipline (NASA, Other, or Potential),\nas described in chapters 3 through 9, is also shown in\nthe matrix.\n\nNASA HOLOGRAPHIC CONTRIBUTIONS\nThe NASA Centers are oriented to basic and\napplied research; thus their primary goal is to discover\nand develop new techniques, materials, or equipment\nfor present and future generations of aerospace and\nrelated systems. All of these endeavors require highly\nsophisticated data storage, data processing, image\nforming, scanning, data communications, tracking,\nand optical beam steering. In addition, many final\nsystems, subsystems, and components must be tested\nduring design and construction by nondestructive\ndirect methods.\nTable 2 and the subsequent chapters of this survey\nshow that NASA\'s contribution to holography has\nbeen direct and substantial. Particularly promising is\nthe developmental work on holographic data storage\nand data processing systems, which, because of their\ncompactness and extremely high-density data storage\ncharacteristics, will be ideally suited for future mass\ndata storage needs related to earth resources and\nenvironment, law enforcement, and medical records.\nThe extent of NASA\'s work in holographic interferometry also indicates the importance of nondestructive holographic testing in meeting space and\nlaunch vehicle systems test requirements.\nNASA\'s work in holography for aerospace technology already has led to some nonaerospace applications. For example, early work to develop cold-spray\nand rocket combustion holocameras by the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (JPL) in conjunction with the\nDepartment of Defense (DOD) has led one contractor\ninto a series of development efforts with the Environmental Protection Agency to construct equipment for\nanalyzing processes inside commercial furnace stacks\nand domestic heating systems as a pollution control\nmeasure. Each NASA-funded effort could become\nsuch a "seed" development in holograpny. This\nnatural transfer of information and engineering skills\nis taking place continuously in all aerospace projects,\nand is being deliberately accelerated through the\nactivities of the NASA Technology Utilization Office\n(ref. 5).\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nPrinciples of Holography\nHolography has been called lensless photography,\nand in a sense this is correct. However, its differences\nfrom photography are more numerous and important\nthan its similarities (ref. 6). We can think of holography as being a method of "stopping" a traveling\nwave front and capturing or storing it on film; the\nreconstruction process then "starts up" the wavefront\nagain after an interval of time and possibly a change\nof position. This "started up" wavefront can then\nform an image or be viewed just as it originally\nappeared when radiated or reflected from the subject.\nFor clarification, let us review some basic facts\nabout wave behavior. Any electromagnetic wave,\nincluding a light wave, has both an amplitude and\nphase value at a given time and place. The amplitude\nof an invisible electromagnetic wave is exactly onehalf the height from peak to trough. The amplitude\nof a visible ocean wave is similarly determined. Phase\nis a measurement of which part of a wave (from one\npeak to the next succeeding peak) is passing through\na given point at a given time. The energy contained in\nan ocean wave is proportional to the square of its\namplitude; light wave energy or intensity is measured\nin the same way.\nNow consider a block of wood floating on the\nocean. As the peaks and troughs of a wave pass\nthrough, the block is alternately elevated or depressed\nin relation to the normal ocean surface. The instantaneous displacement of the block is dependent on\nthe wave\'s amplitude and phase.\nFinally try to recall the effect when two "trains"\nof ocean waves collide. The new single wave train\nwhich forms is usually of a different amplitude than\neither of the waves that formed it. Where the phases\nreinforce each other (peak on top of peak), their\namplitudes tend to add, and constructive interference\noccurs; where the phases oppose each other (peak on\ntroughs), their amplitudes tend to subtract, and\ndestructive interference occurs.\n\nLight waves behave exactly as do ocean waves, and\nthe results of their interference (both constructive\nand destructive) can be made visible on photographic\nfilm. Ordinary photographic film responds to the\nintensity of light to which it is exposed. The density\nof the developed film can, through proper processing,\nbe made proportional to the intensity of squared\namplitude of the light wave pattern that strikes it.\nThis is conventional photography. Using ordinary\nphotography, there is no way to make the film\ndensity vary with the phase of the light striking it;\nthrough holography, this can be done. Because the\nhologram can store both amplitude and phase information, it is able to effectively record a wavefront\nimpinging upon it.\nThe simple representation of holographic fringe\nformation in figure 1 shows how the hologram stores\nphase information. A plane coherent wavefront\nstrikes the prismatic wedge from the left. This wedge\nby refraction splits up the front into an "object" and\na "reference" wave. These two waves are analogous to\nthe colliding ocean waves just described, except that\nthey are tilted at an angle to each other. For example\nconsider the object and reference waves to be of\nequal amplitude; since they originate from the same\ncoherent source wave, they are of equal frequency\nand wavelength.\nThe paths and intersection of these two waves can\nbe followed by the fronts indicated in the figure. For\nexample, notice their intersection or interference at\npoint P of the hologram film plate (fig. Ib). Fronts\nFo and f o represent the position of two successive\namplitude peaks of the object wave at an instant of\ntime, and FR and F"R are similar peaks of the reference\nwave (the distance between Fo and F\'o and FR and\nF1R is their wavelength). Between the wedge\nand the film plate (fig. la), we can visualize a space\nfilled with similar successive wave peaks and with\nwave troughs midway (1/2 wavelength) between each\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nCOHERENT\nSOURCE\nWAVE\n\nREFERENCE WAVE FRONTS\nHOLOGRAM\nPLATE\n\n- REFERENCE WAVE FRONTS\n\nOBJECT WAVE\nFRONTS\n\n\'<\'\n/ / \'\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nF\n\no\n/\n\nTO "C"\n\n//\n\n1\n.\n\n" ,^___\n~~ ~\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x94 .\n\nfLl\nF\n\no\n\n/"\nx/\n\n/ \'\n\n^ ^\n\n\'\n1\n1\nC.\n\nLINES OF\nDESTRUCTIVE \xe2\x80\x94 ^~\nINTERFERENCE \\^^^^^P"\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2i\n\n/\n\n/\n\nPLATE\n\nREFERENCE\nWAVE FRONTS\n\nNOTE:\n\n7 /\n/ /\n, /\n\n/\n/\n\nb.\nFQ.

If the distances CP and RP differ by an even\nnumber of half wavelengths, their interference is\nconstructive at point P (peak on peak); but if they\ndiffer by an odd number of half wavelengths, their\ninterference is destructive at point P (peak on trough)\n(refs. 7 and 8). The figure shows the latter condition.\nThis destructive interference would be represented on\nthe hologram by a dark line, called a "dark fringe."\nAs we travel up the plate, observe that the distance\nfrom the first front Fo (fig. la) to the plate is shorter\nthan before, while the distance from CR (fig. la)\nremains the same. At some point higher up on the\nfilm plate, P1, a constructive interference (peak on\npeak), takes place; further up, a second destructive\ninterference takes place at p", and so on up the plate\n(fig. Ib). In this manner, a series of dark line fringes\nof equal separation are produced on the film.\n\nIf the phase of the object wave is shifted so that\nthe peak occurs at F"Q (somewhere between Fo and\nF1\'Q), while the phase of the reference wave remains\nthe same, then the position of the fringe lines will\nshift on the film plate, but their separation will not\nchange. Thus by the interference of the two waves it\nis possible to record a relative phase change between\nthem as well as their amplitudes. This is the basis of\nholography: The exposed photographic film plate has\nrecorded both the amplitude and phase of the object\nwavefront relative to the reference wavefront.\nIf the angle of tilt between the two waves (fig. Ib)\nis increased, as represented by wavefront FQ*, then\nthe distance up the plate from P at which the next\ndark fringe occurs will be shortened; hence more\ninterference fringes will occur per unit of length. This\nmeans that the resolution capability of the film (its\n\nPRINCIPLES OF HOLOGRAPHY\ncapacity to record fringe lines per unit length) must\nbe higher.\nThe discussion thus far has assumed that the waves\nforming the object and reference front are exactly the\nsame length and, although shifted in relative phase,\nremain constant during exposure of the photographic\nplate or film. But if the relative phases of the two\ninterfering waves are changed during the exposure,\nthen the fringe positions also shift during exposure. If\nsuch a shift is random and amounts to a displacement\nof one-half the distance between dark fringes, the\nfringe pattern will be almost completely washed out.\nHowever, when fringe shifts are regular during an\nexposure, it is sometimes possible to record an\naverage of the fringe patterns. This is the basis for\ntime-averaging holographic interferometry.\nRelative phase shifts between two waves occur in\ntwo principal ways: (1) by a change in the distance\neither wave travels from the source to the film or (2)\nby a change in the index of refraction of the medium\n(usually an air pressure or temperature change)\nthrough which either wave travels. A third type of\nphase change can be caused by a change in the\nfrequency of either the source or the object wave, as\nwhen it is reflected from a moving surface.\nIt a transparent small subject is placed completely\nin the path of the object beam (fig. 2), the absorption\nand index of refraction of this subject will produce\nphase and amplitude changes in the wavefront passing\nthrough it. The resultant scattered object wave\ninterferes with the plane reference wave to produce\nan irregular interference pattern rather than regular\nfringe lines. This recorded pattern will form a\nhologram of the transparent subject (ref. 7).\nAn arrangement such as this, using a separate\nreference and object beam, is called two beam\nholography. Subjects can also be placed directly in\nthe path of the reference beam (with no separate\nobject beam formed); this is referred to as inline\nholography.\n\nCOHERENT\nSOURCE ^.\nWAVE\n\n17\n\xe2\x80\xa2 TRANSPARENT SUBJECT\n\\,-..-\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\nHOW AND WHY THE HOLOGRAM WORKS\n\nThe appearance of any object, no matter how\ncomplicated, is a sum of reflecting or scattering\npoints in three-dimensional space. When that object is\ncoherently illuminated and a hologram is recorded,\neach point will form its own individual interference\npattern. The interference pattern or hologram of a\npoint is called a zone plate. Appendix A explains in\ndetail the formation of this zone plate and how, when\nthe laser beam illuminates the zone plate, a virtual\nand a real image of the original point is reconstructed.\nSince the total holographic pattern from an object is\nthe superposition of all these individual zone plate\npatterns, the proper reillumination of the hologram\nwill reconstruct both a virtual and a real image of\nevery point on the original object. The sum of the\nvirtual point images will reconstruct a perfect replica\nof the original object for the viewer. The sum of the\nreal point images will allow the projection and\nformation in space of a three-dimensional image of\nthe original object. Both of these properties are used\nextensively in holography (refs. 9 through 11).\nThis effect for two beam holography of a complex\nobject is illustrated in figure 3. Here, a coherent\nobject beam strikes the front (heavy line) surface of\nthe double-triangular prismatic object and reflects\ndown to the recording plate, while the reference\nbeam strikes the plate from below. The figure on the\nleft of the recording plate represents both the original\nobject and also the reconstructed virtual image, while\nthe figure on the right is the reconstructed real image.\nRefer to appendix A for details.\nNotice that every point of the reconstructed image\nis formed at exactly the same distance from the\nrecording plane on the left as the object is located\nfrom the plane on the right. This produces an effect\ncalled a reversed contour, or pseudoscopic image,\nsince an observer viewing the real image from the\nright will see only the dark lined surface. Thus he will\nsee a peak where there was a dip on the original and\n\n-OBJECT WAVE FRONT\n\nHOLOGRAM\nPLATE\nREFERENCE WAVE FRONTS \'\n\nFIGURE 2.-Hologram formation.\n\n534-778 O-74\xe2\x80\x942\n\n10\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\nBEAM\nSPLITTER\n\n1\nI\n\nIOTOGRAPHIC\nILM\n\nRECONSTRUCTED\nREAL IMAGE\n\nPINHOLE\n\nBEAM\nSPLITTER\n\nTEST VOLUME .\n\nFIGURE 3.\xe2\x80\x94 Pseudoscopic image reconstruction.\nPHOTOGRAPHIC\nFILM\n\nvice versa. As illustrated by the dotted line on the\nfigure, the baseline will not actually be formed in the\nreal image, so that the reversed order contour is easily\nobserved. This effect becomes even more troublesome\nwith more complicated objects. Normal perspective real images can be formed either by reconstructing a second generation hologram or by using lenses\nin various configurations (refs. 9 and 12).\nPRACTICAL HOLOGRAM PRODUCTION\nSo far we have talked in theoretical terms about\nidealized plane reference and object waves, but in\nreality it is usually practical to use slightly diverging\nor converging waves in one or both beams of a\nsystem. A typical arrangement complete with laser\nlight source, microscope focusing objective, filtering\npinhole, beam splitter, reference beam directing\nmirror, and recording film is shown in figure 4a. As\nindicated in the diagram, the object reflects or\nscatters light energy from its surface onto the film to\nform the object or signal beam, while the reference\nbeam is incident upon the film from the left. The\nmicroscope objective and filter improve the clarity of\nthe hologram\'s interference fringes.\nThe microscope lens focuses the light to a point at\nthe circular pinhole. The light beam then diverges\npast its focus point and illuminates the object and\n\nFIGURE 4.-Practical methods for recording hologram.\n\nfilm. Any nonplanar light front, including spatial\nnoise, will not focus to a point at the pinhole and\nhence will be blocked out. Note that the geometries\nhave been arranged so that the reference and object\npath lengths from the laser are equal.\nThe alternative arrangement (fig. 4b) is for a\ntransparent object, such as a two-dimensional photographic transparency or a volume of a solid, liquid, or\ngas. The configuration is the same except that the\nobject has been shifted in the illuminating beam far\nenough to allow an additional mirro\'r to illuminate\nthe hologram. A typical use is to provide a crosssectional view through a wind tunnel or ballistic\nrange, where the phase perturbations caused by the\npressure flow lines and temperature gradients in the\ntest volume contribute to the hologram. The transparency configuration is also often used for compact\ndata storage and retrieval purposes.\nThe variation shown in figure 5a puts the pinhole\nfilters beyond the beam splitters and deflection\nmirrors, providing a cleaner and higher quality hologram. Another variation often used (fig. 5b) is to\n\nPRINCIPLES OF HOLOGRAPHY\nMICROSCOPE\nOBJECTIVE |\nI\n\nLASER\n\n\\-\n\n\\\n\nx V|\xe2\x80\x94\n^\nBEAM\nSPLITTER\n\nI PINI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x94 -\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSIGNAL\nBEAM\n\nREFERENCE ...\nBEAM .^/PHOTOGRAPHIC\nFILM\n\nA\nTEST\n\nMODEL\n\nFIGURE 5.\xe2\x80\x94Alternate hologram recording methods.\n\nplace a lens just beyond the pinhole filter, which\ncollimates the light passing through the transparent\ntest volume. This arrangement permits production of\nSchlieren photos, shadowgraphs, and single perspective holograms (ch. 3). The single perspective results\nfrom the fact that a given ray through the top and\nbottom of the test volume strikes separate positions\nrather than all positions on the hologram recording\nfilm; when the top part of the hologram is viewed by\nthe observer, the bottom part of the test volume\ncannot be seen, and vice versa. Multiple perspective\ncan be obtained in such cases (the property of the\nnormal hologram) by inserting a diffusing screen or\nscatter plate (fig. 5b) before illuminating the test\nvolume. Some rays will then pass through each point\nin the test volume and strike each part of the\nrecording film. A diffuse reflection (scattering at all\nangles from the point of reflection) from a solid\nobject produces the same effect (ref. 12). Surprisingly\nthe hologram reconstruction properly sorts out even\nthese diverse and complex patterns into the correct\nimage of the original object.\nBASIC PROPERTIES OF HOLOGRAMS\n\nThe most startling quality of the hologram is its\nformation of both a virtual and a real image as\npreviously described. The virtual image looks\n\n11\n\nidentical to the original three-dimensional object,\nbecause the actual wavefront amplitude and phase are\ntotally reconstructed. Since each eye sees a slightly\ndifferent perspective, they construct a threedimensional stereoscopic image, and movement of the\nhead permits each eye to see a changing perspective as\nin an actual scene. The real image reconstruction, on\nthe other hand, is pseudoscopic and has inverted\ncontours. Holography repeals no law of optics, so\nthat these holographic images are subject to all the\nnormal optical image aberrations and perturbations,\nsuch as spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, field\ncurvature, and distortion.\nAnother useful property of the hologram is its\nreciprocity during reconstruction. This means not\nonly that the object wave be reconstructed by the\nreference wave (the normal method), but also that\nthe reference wave can be reconstructed by the object\nwave. This property is essential for optical data\nprocessing and for encoding (ch. 9 and app. B).\nThe reconstructed image on a hologram can also\nbe magnified. This is done by three different\nmethods: (1) the ratio of wavelengths used to\nreconstruct and record can be changed; (2) the scale\nof the hologram used to reconstruct can be changed,\nrelative to that used to record; and (3) the hologram\ncan be illuminated by a spherical wave whose radius\nof curvature is different from that used to record.\nThe last method always produces image aberrations\nof some sort, but the first two methods can be\ncombined to produce magnified, aberration-free\nimages when plane recording and reconstruction\nwaves are used. However, only one of the reconstructed images (virtual or real) can be produced\naberration-free at the same time (ref. 13).\nThe critical requirements for producing a good\nhologram are a reference beam, an object beam, a\nrecording light source, a hologram plate, and equipment to direct and form the geometry of the two\nprincipal beams. These two beams must be coherent\nin two ways: (1) their frequencies must be equal and\ntheir relative phases to each other must remain\nconstant with time; and (2) all positions of a plane\nreference wave must be of the same phase at the same\ntime.* These conditions are usually called temporal\ncoherence and spatial coherence respectively (ref.\n14).\n\nThis is a restriction on classes of spatially coherent waves.\n\n12\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nThe laser beam is the only practical optical source\nthat can meet these two conditions, although even\nlaser output is neither completely monochromatic\nnor exclusively of one frequency. The degree of\nspread in frequencies (temporal coherence) is usually\nexpressed by a parameter called the coherence length,\nsince path length differences less than the coherence\nlength are required to observe holographic interference effects. If this difference is exceeded, then\nthe fringes produced by the lowest frequencies of the\nlight source wash out those produced by the highest\nfrequencies. Any inequality of path lengths will cause\nsome fringe shift, even if the coherence length is large;\nthus much effort has been devoted to designing equal\npath lengths that provide maximum subject depth for\nhologram recording. Continuous wave lasers are\ncapable of coherence lengths up to a kilometer, but\nnarrow Q-switch lasers needed for holographic\ninterferometry have only recently attained values of\nbetween 1 and 10 meters. Careful operation, adjustment, and filtering of laser sources are usually\nrequired to attain the coherence properties desired in\nholography (refs. 14 and 15).\nOther important factors in hologram production\nare the ratio of reference beam to object beam\nintensity during recording (ref. 16), the relationship\nbetween light intensity and exposure time (ref. 17),\n\nthe geometric arrangement of the object and reference beams as it affects spatial resolution (ref. 18),\nand the stability (freedom from motion or vibration)\nof the equipment components. Rigid support,\nacoustic isolation, and foundations of damped granite\ntables or sand boxes are usually necessary to ensure\nequipment stability. (These factors are described in\nmore detail in app. C.)\nCLASSIFICATION OF HOLOGRAMS\nThere are many ways of classifying holograms,\neach emphasizing different properties. The following\neight major classes or sets of categories are commonly\nused: 1. transmission/reflection mode holograms, 2.\nthick/thin, 3. volume/plane, 4. color/monochrome, 5.\noptical/mi crowave/acoustic/seismic/computer, 6.\namplitude/phase, 7. time-average/single- or doubleexposure, and 8. sideband/inline. In general, the\nindividual categories of each class include all possible\nholograms, and these categories may be considered\nways of describing or characterizing a hologram. Thus\na single sideband, thick, volume, color phase hologram of an object could be recorded using a double\nexposure technique with optical energy in the reflection mode. (These categories are described in more\ndetail in app. C.)\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nSingle Exposure Holographic Recording\nA hologram may be recorded in a single exposure,\nand single exposures of moving objects may be\nrecorded by very short laser pulses. Work in this area\nhas been carried on both by NASA and by commercial/industrial groups.\nNASA has been active in promoting the following\ntypes of single exposure holographic recordings:\n\ntunnel and dust erosion tests, and to monitor rocket\ntest stand operations.\nNASA RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nHolography of Microparticles\n\nThe effect of hypersonic impact or erosion of the\nreentry shield, shroud, or outer skin of space vehicles\nwith clouds of micrometeorites is a critical aerospace\nproblem, as is the erosion and possible damage caused\nby supersonic bombardment of aircraft panels and\nother structures by dust, dirt, or aerosol particles.\nWork is under way at the Langley Research Center\n(LRC) to simulate these effects by impact tests using\nartificial microparticles. To evaluate the tests properly, the density and size of the microparticles at\nimpact must be very accurately known.\nAlthough these particles may be photographed by\npulsed laser light, this technique makes it impossible\nto determine their size accurately, and only a very\nnarrow slice of the whole cloud can be focused in\neach photograph. If the exact position of the microparticle cloud is not known, coverage of dynamic\nevents requires a whole battery of cameras, one\ncamera for each slice making up the active test\nvolume. Still the images cannot show accurate\nparticle size and location. This problem can be solved\nwith holography. One hologram can record the entire\nvolume of the dynamic cloud of particles, and its\nreconstruction enables the exact size and threedimensional position of each particle in the cloud to\nbe measured.\nLRC has recently been using inline holography to\nstudy the impact of tungsten and glass microparticles\nupon various types of structures. As shown by the\ndiagram (fig. 6), only a single illuminating beam is\nrequired, and the hologram is formed by the interference between the plane illuminating wavefront and\n\nholography of microparticles\nrocket engine holocameras\nholography of objects in motion\naids to practical holography\nCommercial and industrial organizations are now\ndeveloping single exposure systems using conventional and nonconventional recording materials.\nThese holographic recordings are being applied to:\nanalyzing pollutants from furnaces, fuel systems,\nand engines\nstudying reacting sprays and dust erosion\ndetecting eye disorders\nconstructing holograms from ordinary photographs\ndiagnosing plasmas\nAt this time, however, neither NASA nor industry\nhas been able to establish a clearcut commercial\napplication competitive in cost and efficiency with\nalternative techniques.

Since the hologram is a simultaneous\n\nrecording of a number of microparticles at varying\ndistances from the film, its reconstruction simultaneously forms the real three-dimensional images of\nall the particles in the cloud at their correct sizes and\ndistances from each other and from the hologram. By\n\nSINGLE EXPOSURE HOLOGRAPHIC RECORDING\n\n15\n\nFIGURE 8.-TV holographic reconstruction.\n\nusing an auxiliary optical system during the reconstruction, successive planes of this image can be\nsequentially focused, magnified, and examined.\nDuring the experiments at LRC, the real image\nplanes were focused onto a TV camera and monitored\non a TV viewing screen, greatly improving the\ncontrast of the reconstructed image and making data\nreduction easier (refs. 22 and 23). This improvement\nis obvious in figure 8.\nRocket Holocamera Development\n\nA team from Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge, Inc.\n(TRW) Systems Group and JPL pioneered the\ndevelopment of rocket engine holocameras. Knowledge of the dynamic particle distributions of fuel and\noxidizer during combustion is important for improving rocket propulsion systems and developing new\npropellants. The distribution of particle diameters\nand densities identifies problems connected with\nproper atomizing, mixing, and burning of the liquid\nand gaseous components in the rocket engines. Laser\nphotography of these processes suffers from the same\nlimitations noted above for microparticles. Even\ninline holography encounters severe problems due to\n\nthe higher density of the reacting components and\nthe high level of energy radiated by the combustion\nprocess. This high density of components causes great\nattenuation of the reference beam with respect to the\nscene and makes the proper ratio very difficult to\nachieve. Sideband holography in the holocamera\nreduced these problems.\nThe transmission mode holocamera, designed to\nwork in the natural environment of the rocket engine\ntest stand, has taken holograms of the combustion\nprocess of liquid rockets fueled with a number of\ndifferent propellants. A photograph of the holocamera attached to the test rocket engine is shown in\nfigure 9. The camera was remotely controlled from a\nblockhouse 500 feet from the test stand.\nBest results were obtained during open flame tests,\nalthough some successful holograms were taken\nthrough windowed chambers. The holograms were\nrecorded under the vibrational loads, thermal environment, and corrosive atmosphere encountered in\ntypical rocket tests with earth storable propellants.\nThe tests could detect individual droplets from\nrecords of preliminary cold water spray and reacting\nopen flame spray, but only clusters of reacting\ncomponents could be determined from holography of\n\n16\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nFIGURE 9.-Laser holocamera straddling 18-inch-diameter engine.\n\nthe confined combustion runs. The major problems\nencountered during these tests were engine starting\nroughness causing holocamera component accelerations as high as 30 g, heavy turbulence or convection\nof the combustion gases, and erosion of capped\nwindows within the confined test chamber. The\nturbulence severely attenuated the laser scene beam\n(refs. 24 and 25). The holocamera schematic is shown\nin figure 10.\nReconstructed holophotographs of impinging cold\nspray and reacting hot spray during the cold flow and\nopen flame tests were made. Figure 11 shows the\nopen flame reconstructed hologram. The maximum\nresolution of the holocamera was 25 microns, but\nlaser speckle limited the smallest observable droplet\ndiameter to about 50 microns (refs. 26 through 28).\nImproved pulsed ruby lasers with much longer\n\ncoherence length are now available. These should\nalleviate some of the problems encountered in earlier\ntests and relax the stringent geometric matching\nrequirements of the holocamera to achieve fine\nresolutions. However, the original contribution of this\nrocket holocamera to the technology of operating in\nthe harsh vibrational, thermal, and internal absorptive\nenvironment of rocket test chambers has been clearly\nestablished.\nHolography of Objects in Motion\n\nNASA has been experimenting with a number\nmethods for obtaining holograms of objects\nmotion.

One series of\nexperiments was based on the fact that the amplitude\nof the far field diffraction pattern of an object\nilluminated by coherent light will be invariant with\nthe motion of the object, but that the phase of the\npattern will vary with the object\'s position off axis\nand along the axis. This changing phase factor can be\nexactly compensated for by using the light intensity\nreflected from the moving object itself as the source\nfor the reference beam (ref. 29). A second approach\nwas to analyze the movement of the diffraction\npattern fringes produced from normal inline holography, showing a correlation between the fringe\nmovement and object velocity (ref. 30).\nBoth of these attempts encountered practical\ndifficulties, but the most promising attack on the\nproblem makes use of the geometric properties of an\nellipse. If an illuminating source is positioned at one\nfocus of an ellipse, a hologram plate at the other, and\nthe object to be recorded moves along a tangent to\nthe surface of the ellipse, the optical path length of\nthe subject beam will be invariant during a short\nexposure. Therefore, the interference between the\nsubject and reference beam will also be invariant, and\nstationary holographic fringes will be formed as\nreflected from the moving surface.\nAt the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) this\n\napproach was tested experimentally to record pulsed\nruby laser holograms of the surface of a rapidly\nspinning disk. Several modifications of the basic\nconcept were devised during the tests. Figure 12\nshows the experimental configuration using this\nconcept; figure 13 is a photo of the experimental\nsetup; and figure 14 shows a series of photographs of\nthe reconstructed holograms taken at increasing\nvelocities of the disk. Note that as the velocity\nincreases, the maximum distance between points on\nthe disk\'s surface to meet the required conditions of\nnear invariance during exposure becomes smaller and\nsmaller, as shown by the narrowing of the region over\nwhich a bright reconstruction occurs (refs. 31\nthrough 33).\nAids to Practical Holography\n\nNASA personnel at Ames Research Center (ARC),\nLRC, MSFC, and Goddard Space Flight Center\n(GSFC) have been active in developing new concepts\nand procedures to aid the setting up, recording, and\nprocessing of successful holograms.\nH. Lackner of MSFC invented a scheme for\nchecking the vibration level of the subject and the\nhologram plate fixture and its effect on blurring and\nwiping out the holographic interference fringes.\n\n18\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nFIGURE 11.-Pulsed ruby laser reconstruction of hologram B1117G, recorded\noriginally on 2-6-68 at JPL Edwards of N 2 O 4 -50/50 N2H,, UDMH\npropellant combustion. O/F = 1.25.\n\nExcessive vibration of these elements is one of the\nchief pitfalls for the beginning holographer, and to\ndate methods for diagnosing this problem have been\ncomplex and unwieldy.\nThe basic idea is to produce two sets of interference fringes, one set to monitor the vibrations of\n\nthe object and the other set to monitor the combined\nvibrations of both the object and the holographic\nrecording plate (ref. 34). Observation of these fringes\nbefore the hologram is exposed can ensure clean,\nhigh-contrast fringes (fig. 15).\nR.

As a direct result of the experience gained in developing and operating the rocket\nengine holocamera, TRW instrumented a large crosssectional area (24 by 48 feet) of a TVA coal-fired\nsteam boiler with a holocamera working on a new\ntwo reference beam principle (fig. 17). Holograms\nwere taken to evaluate different means of removing\noxides of sulfur from stack gases of stationary power\nplants.\nThese oxides contribute heavily to atmospheric\npollution if they are not completely removed by a\ncomplex process combining chemical combustion and\nelectrical precipitation. The efficiency of this process\ndepends upon the uniformity and coverage of clouds\nof pulverized dry limestone periodically blown into\nthe furnace.

(ARO). R. A. Belz, J. D. Trolinger, and coworkers have obtained holograms of reacting liquid\nspray droplets down to 15 microns diameter using an\ninline holocamera mounted on a rocket test stand.\nInline holography has also been used at ARO to\nmake coherent shadowgrams in a hypersonic dust\nerosion facility to record explosions, plasmas, and\nengine exhausts in wind tunnels. These holograms\ncan give information about flow fields, particulate\n\nFIGURE 16.-Variable ratio beam splitter.\ncontents, and fluid effects. In addition, ARO personnel have made data reductions based on theoretical\ndiffraction studies involving inline holograms of\nprojectiles in flight (refs. 47 through 49).\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n22\n\nPHOTODETECTOR TO MONITOR L A S E R OUTPUT\nG L A S S WEDGE BEAM S P L I T T E R\n\nCORNER PRISM\n\nEXPANDING AND\nCOLLIMATING T E L E S C O P E\n\n5 INCH DIA.

A number of researchers have been\nexperimenting with three-dimensional holographic\nimages of human and animal eyes. These methods\nhave enabled the detection of glaucoma and other\nsuch ailments even in the presence of cataracts.\nHolography can record the innermost layer of the\nback part of the eyeball for later analysis, as well as\nnearer layers along the optical path (ref. 50).\nThanks to a new procedure, holograms can be\nmade using only a series of photographs taken by a\n\ncamera in ordinary illumination. This technique\nsimplifies holography of objects at substantial distances from the camera. It is a three-step process.\nFirst, a montage of ordinary photographs is made\nfrom a variety of aspect angles; second, these are\nrecorded in a special way on a hologram using\ncoherent light; and, third, the hologram is illuminated\nto reconstruct the three-dimensional image. The\nprocess does not work when precise holograms are\nrequired, such as those needed in holographic interferometry (ref. 51).\nHolographic techniques have also been applied to\n\nSINGLE EXPOSURE HOLOGRAPHIC RECORDING\nsuch diverse problems as determining the density\nprofile in a laser-created plasma, examining the\nbubble spectrum in a cavity tunnel, studying the\noptical properties of atmospheric aerosols, measuring\nliquid droplets in carburetors, studying laser velocimetry, and analyzing electron-beam induced front\nsurface effects. Incoherent holography has been used\nto photograph the stars. Keuffel and Esser Company\nreported a holographic method for monitoring the\nperformance of large mirrors; and Laser Focus has\ndescribed an ingenious holographic art studio using\nboxes of sand as mounts rather than expensive slabs\nof granite (refs. 52 through 60).\n\nTHE FUTURE\nHolographic Diagnostics and Measurements\n\nMany industrial problems associated with the\nbehavior of mil-sized particles, droplets, spray, or\nmoving parts may be amenable to holographic diagnostics and measurements. These industrial applications usually involve processes of relatively low\nvelocity in near normal atmospheres, and can probably be handled by current holographic devices.\nMeasurement, monitoring, and mapping of the size\ndistribution, particle densities, and particle density\nisobars in volumes and planes of space appear feasible\nfor all types of aerosol, spray, and particle concentrations. The use of more sophisticated two- and\nthree-beam holocameras like those developed for\npollution control studies will probably allow examination and measurement of the internal functioning\nof gasoline engines, carburetors, rocket chambers,\nfuel combustion, and chemical and nuclear reaction\nchambers. Dye lasers that can be tuned to minimum\nabsorption wavelengths of the reacting gases and\ncombustion products should be investigated as illumination sources.\nBecause of the advances in holography, processes\nsuch as combustion, burning, explosion, carburetion,\nexhaust, emission, impact, braking, erosion, seeding,\ncatalysis, mixing, dispersion, and diffusion will be\nobserved and controlled more efficiently than ever\nbefore. The potential in this field is enormous,\nranging from pollution control to the design and\nproduction of better aerosol containers that will\nprovide finer, more evenly distributed sprays of\ninsecticide, paint, and deodorizer.\n\n23\n\nRecording Materials\n\nNASA and its contractors have developed a number of techniques and devices to aid industrial\nconcerns embarking into new areas. Among these are\nhigh velocity recording materials and practical aids\nfor recording holograms.\nOne of the practical problems in producing good\nholograms is to learn how such things as hologram\nexposure levels, reference-to-scene-beam ratio, exposure time, type of recording medium, and other\nconsiderations will affect the diffraction efficiency,\ncontrast ratio, and resolution of the reconstructed\nhologram. At present there are no standardized\nholographic curves of performance. Scientists and\nengineers at MSFC have recently begun an ambitious\nseries of controlled experiments and precision laboratory measurements aimed at filling this gap.\nThe University of Michigan has also been under\nNASA contract for some time to develop techniques\nfor improving the diffraction efficiency of holograms.\nBleaching of silver images has been successful in\nproducing phase hologram diffraction efficiencies of\n60 to 70 percent. Photochromies have also been\nstudied because of their potential for real-time\nprocessing by exposure to radiation of the proper\nwavelength. They also show promise for development\nof erasable holograms because of their reversible\ncharacteristics. However, since they produce only\namplitude holograms they are limited to about a\n4-percent maximum diffraction efficiency (refs. 61\nand 62).\nNASA contractors and many individuals and research groups are exploring new materials that promise real-time and erasable characteristics. Hughes\nResearch Laboratory has developed photopolymer\nmaterials for phase holograms exhibiting very rapid\ndevelopment time, moderate sensitivity, diffraction\nefficiencies up to 45 percent, and resolutions up to\n1500 line pairs per millimeter. Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) has been concentrating on dichromated\ngelatin for the same purposes. Neither of these phase\nhologram materials is erasable, but erasable photochromic materials being developed by Radio Corporation of America and the Soviet Union typically have\nlow diffraction efficiencies (refs. 63 and 64).\nThe prospect of erasable phase holograms with\nhigh diffraction efficiency is being explored by BTL,\nSperry Rand Research Center, Texas Instruments,\nXerox, RCA, Honeywell, and International Business\n\n24\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nMachines researchers. Materials such as ferroelectric\nbarium titanate and lithium niobate crystals, thermoplastic or elastomer film sandwiches, and thin ferromagnetic films are currently under investigation (ref.\n64). One of the most promising is the arsenic\ntrisulfide film discovered at RCA which can be\nvisually observed during real-time dry development\nusing light (ref. 65).\nSeveral researchers have made successful holograms with infrared energy. F. M. Shofmer of\n\nEnvironmental Systems Company used conventional\nKodak IR film 2481 to make inline holograms (ref.\n66). Ling-Temco-Vought, Inc. (.LTV), used a thermochromic crystalline type material, while the Japanese\nare experimenting with photochromic films and\nliquid crystal area detectors to record infrared holograms at the 10.6-micrometer wavelength. Before\nreconstruction can take place, the thermo-image on\nthe detector must be recorded on ordinary film (refs.\n67 through 69).\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nHolographic Display\nusing holography in design, architecture, advertising,\nand other commercial areas, and to compare the cost\nwith that of more conventional techniques.\n\nThe earliest application of holography was the\ndisplay of amazingly realistic three-dimensional\nimages. Yet in many ways, the display aspect of\nholography has not kept pace with more esoteric\napplications. NASA has done a limited amount of\nwork in the field, and some other government and\nprivate organizations have also made contributions.\nHolographic displays generally fall into two\ngroups: (1) those where the three-dimensional image\nmay be viewed directly, as in advertising displays, and\n(2) those where the image is picked up by a TV\ncamera for two-dimensional display. This chapter\ndiscusses mainly single-exposure presentations of\nrecorded holograms. Multiple exposures or fast time\nsequences are covered more fully in chapter 7, and\nholographic display devices developed for presentation of acoustic holograms are described in chapter 8.\nNASA and its contractors have formulated display\nconcepts for training, for status and situation presentations, and for special effects. They have also\nproposed ideas for hologram displays using extended\nillumination sources and synthetic point generators.\nSome effort has been made to produce large threedimensional displays for advertising, engineering,\nscientific, and entertainment purposes. Several of\nthese devices can present color images largely free of\nthe objectionable laser speckle effect, while others are\ndesigned to help evaluate the complex holographic\ninterference patterns produced by inline holography\nor holographic interferometry. With DOD support,\nseveral separate schemes are being pursued for development of a flight simulator and synthetic threedimensional displays for air traffic control, status and\nreadiness, and other aircraft requirements.\nOnly the large three-dimensional display systems\nand the smaller portable systems may be considered\ncommercially useful. Marketable and profitable exploitation of these display systems cannot be evaluated yet, since it is difficult to estimate the cost of\n\nNASA RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nAs early as 1967-68, NASA sponsored a study of\nhow holographic displays could serve as training aids,\ncockpit displays, and static displays. This study\ndeveloped the concept for a system to train an\nastronaut by simulating the approach to a target\nvehicle during a rendezvous maneuver.\nTo achieve realism in such displays, it is critical to\nsimulate as closely as possible the angular size of the\ntarget and its apparent approach distance and velocity. So far the best ways devised to create the\nthree-dimensional effect are by stereo movies or\nholography. The main drawback of stereo movies is\ntheir lack of flexibility in the angle of approach; the\nobserver is also required to wear special glasses or\nfilters that are annoying. University of Michigan, the\nNASA contractor, discovered that by moving the\ndistance and the angle of a point reconstruction\nsource from the illuminated hologram, the apparent\ndistance from the observer and the orientation of the\ntarget vehicle could be changed. This analysis, based\non sound holographic theory, derived an exact\nexpression for the apparent size and velocity of the\nsimulated target as it moved toward the observer.\nThis was then compared with the real target\'s size and\nvelocity.\nOne tentative concept for reconstructing and\nviewing the virtual holographic image is shown in\nfigure 18. The hologram is the "window" for the\nobserver. This approach was discarded because the\napparent angular magnification of the virtual image\nfailed to match the actual situation. The problem was\nsolved by using a simulation system based on reconstruction of the real holographic image. This more\n25\n\n534-778 O-74\xe2\x80\x943\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n26\n\nReconstruction\nSource\n\n-\xe2\x80\x94d\n\nLens\nof\nEye\n\nTrue Imoge\n\nof\nTarget Vehicle\n\nImoge\non\nRetina\n\nHologram\nFIGURE 18. -Simulating spacecraft rendezvous by holography.\n\nHologram\nReal\nImage\nof\nTarget\nVehicle\n\n/\n\nWindow\n\nEye\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ns^>\nuctlon\n\nRetina\n\n>\n\n/\n\nT\n\nn\n\n: uLr\n\nSource\n\nFIGURE 19.-Geometry for observing the real image of a hologram in a\nspacecraft rendezvous problem.\n\ncomplex system requires a separate window aperture\nas well as the hologram (fig. 19). The apparent\napproach velocity of the target is the most critical\nfactor and must equal the velocity of the real target\nat all ranges. Movement of the angle of the reconstructing source point can simulate an angular rotation of the target; it is governed by the thickness of\nthe hologram emulsion. Using a standard thick\nhologram, the target can be rotated a maximum of\nabout 10 degrees before the image is extinguished.\nA second novel idea advanced during this study\nwas to holographically simulate a cockpit display for\ntesting navigation aids. The basic idea was to reconstruct a number of higher diffraction order points\n\nupon illumination instead of the nominal first order.\nThis series of reconstructed points can be made to\nappear as a set of straight lines converging near the\ntop of the display, thus simulating the appearance of\nperspective.\nAlthough holography is popularly called lensless\nphotography, the basic holographic equipment is\nusually augmented with lenses to magnify the reconstructed image or to increase the field of view (ch. 5).\nAt the Electronic Research Center (ERC) a method\nwas invented that permits a less precise match\nbetween the reference illumination used for reconstruction and display and the one needed to record\nthe hologram. The two patent applications related to\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY\nthis invention claim that "the same or a different\ncoherent extended source, a point coherent source\ncan be used" during the reconstruction. Moreover the\n"hologram or reference source misalignment is not\ncritical," and the real image reconstructed is nonpseudoscopic (not distorted inside-out) as is normally the\ncase (ref. 75).\nThe basic idea of this invention is quite simple\n(figs. 20a through 20c). Instead of making a hologram\nof an object either by reflection or transmission of\nscattered energy, as in the conventional method, a\nhologram is made by exposing the plate to the real\nimage (aerial) of the object. This image is projected\nonto the hologram plate by means of a large aperture,\nhigh quality lens (L in the figure). Such an arrangement permits the image to be formed immediately in\nfront of the plate (fig. 20a), to straddle the plate (fig.\n20c), or to project out beyond the plate (fig. 20b). All\nof these configurations may be used, depending upon\nthe display effect desired. The feature of producing\nthe real image very close to the plate, according to\nthe inventor, L. Rosen, allows relaxation of precise\npositioning and alignment conditions on the diffuse\nsource used for the reconstruction. The major obstacle is the need for high quality, large aperture lenses\n(about 5 in. in diameter) to form the holograms (refs.\n75 and 76).\n\nCOMMERCIAL ENDEAVORS\nCommercial Displays\n\nA commercial holographic display at the opening\nof General Motors\' International Building was set up\nin an octagonal case with four "windows" that were\nactually holograms, each containing two different\nscenes. The visible scene was governed by the\nillumination angle of the laser beams; each of the four\nwindows contained different views of the same scene,\nso that by walking around the display case one would\nhave a full 360-degree view. One scene showed a\nNapoleonic coach and the other an auto body. For\nadded impact, the interior of the case was periodically illuminated with diffused light to show that the\ncase was empty. A single source of illumination was\nused for the four 1-1/2 by 2 ft holograms (refs. 77\nand 78).\nDevelopmental work on large holographic displays\nis being pursued by a number of corporations, and\nsmall displays are already on the market. A unit the\n\n27\n\nsize of an attache case (4 by 14 by 18 in.) and\nweighing only 13 Ib is available for $250. Color is\nbeing introduced into displays by using multiple\nlasers. One system uses a krypton laser to obtain red\nand an argon laser to obtain blue and green, producing a full color hologram. A number of combined\nrecording and display systems that make 4 by 5 in.\nholograms and their reconstructions using conventional spectroscopic plates are also on the market\n(refs. 79 through 83).\nAn information processor and display system is\navailable that analyzes inline holograms in the 10- to\n1000-micrometer range and then displays the reconstructed sample volume. The positions of the video\ncamera and imaging lens can be continuously varied\nby the operator to allow accurate focusing and sizing\nof the particles (ref. 84).\nAnother company is experimenting with color\ndisplays in conjunction with a rear projection screen.\nThe use of photoluminescent dyes in an array of\nred-blue-green dots, interacting with the properties of\na nematic-liquid crystal screen for the laser display,\ncan increase contrast and resolution as well as reduce\nspeckle and scintillation. These screens are being\ndeveloped to view microholograms at the output end\nof a high-capacity data storage and retrieval system\n(ch. 9) (refs. 85 and 86).\nDynamic Displays\n\nA dynamic display system is also under development to produce synthetic real images. These threedimensional images are formed holographically from\ninput coordinate data, ideal for situation or readiness\ndisplays. The display is built up in three-dimensional\nspace from a series of dots sequentially formed at a\nrate rapid enough for the eye to see all the dots\ncorresponding to a frame time superimposed in space.\nEach dot is formed holographically by the interference between a displaced object point source and a\nreference point source. This innovation is based on\nthe principle that displacing the object point source\nin the depth direction can be simulated by displacing\nthe reference point source. A feasibility model for a\nquasi-real-time system is currently being constructed.\nThe system requires several seconds for development\nbetween frames (refs. 87 and 88).\nPerhaps the greatest problem with most flight\nsimulators is the difficulty of showing the pilot a\nrealistic image. Many simulators use motion picture\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n28\n\nREAL OBJECT 0\n\nOBJECT\nBEAM I\n\nCHOLOGRAM\nHOLOGRAM PLATE H\n\nPLATE H\n\nJ\n\na.\n\nLASER\nILLUMINATION\nBEAM I\n\n.IECT 0\n\nLASER\nREFERENCE\nBEAM R\n\nRECONSTRUCTION BEAM R R\n\nREAL\nIMAGE 0\'\n^HOLOGRAM H R\nREAL IMAGE 0\'\nC\n\nHOLOGRAM\nf-LATE H\n\nMIRROR M\nC.\n\nd.\n\nRECONSTRUCTION\nBEAM R R\n\n0\'\n\nOBSERVER\n\nLOWELL ROSEN\nINVENTOR.\n\nriOLOGRAM H R\n\ne.\nATTORNEYS\nFIGURE 20.-Recording and reconstructing focused image holograms.\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY\nfilm or TV screens, but these techniques cannot\ncompactly produce a continuously varying threedimensional illusion. DOD is supporting development\nof an airborne holographic heatisup display system\nwhich could assist the landing of an aircraft on board\na carrier either at night or when normal visibility is\nblanked out (fig. 21). The simulator is configured as\nfollows. First a hologram is made of an aircraft carrier\nmodel. After processing, the hologram is illuminated\nby a laser, and its image magnified by a lens to\nrecreate a full three-dimensional presentation at\nnormal viewing range. To depict varying approaches\nand pitch and roll maneuvers, a gimbal and linear\ndrive system has been devised to link the TV camera\nand the hologram. As a result, the picture on the\ndisplay TV is both angularly and spatially correct at\nthe start of the simulation and also continuously\nvaries as the approach is made exactly responding to\nthe controls imposed by the student pilots (refs. 89\nand 90).\nOne of the largest electronic manufacturers is\ndeveloping a holographic system for displaying taped\nvideo programs on home color TV sets. Cost is\ncurrently the primary obstacle in providing the video\ntape to the individual viewer. Scanning conventional\ncolor film appears prohibitively expensive, and the\nuse of video magnetic tape, although less expensive,\ndoes not seem amenable to a high enough data\nstorage density. The "Selectravision" concept may be\nthe answer. In this system, a two-dimensional TV\ndisplay is generated by scanning a reconstructed\nimage formed from a relief phase hologram.\nThe process begins with conventional black and\nwhite filming of a color scene. However, the color\nsignal information is superimposed upon the film in\n\n29\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2WAGING IENS\n\nFIGURE 21.-Feasibility model of holographic\nflight simulator\n\nvertical stripes that are almost invisible. Subsequently\nthe processed film is illuminated with the object\nbeam of a laser and, in combination with the\nreference beam, a relief hologram is made on specially\nprepared tape. After appropriate processing, trp<s tape\nbecomes the master that can be inexpensively reproduced on the embossed tapes used in individual\ncartridges. The compact player, designed to sell for\nabout $400, consists of a low power helium-neon\nlaser, a tape drive system, a small Vidicon TV camera,\nand appropriate electronics.\nFor home viewing, the laser illuminates the hologram frames. The black and white picture is picked up\nby the Vidicon, and the color information is stripped\noff the video signal to provide regular color TV\nsignals for display on the home set. The use of\nembossed vinyl hologram tapes, in addition to providing movies at about $3 a program, has the advantage\nof being far more resistant to scratches, abrasions,\nand imperfections than ordinary film or magnetic\ntape (refs. 91 and 92).\n\nCHAPTERS\n\nHolographic Microscopy\nMicroscopy, the application for which Gabor\ninvented holography, can benefit significantly from\nholographic techniques. Two forms of holographic\nmicroscopy have been developed, one using holography in conjunction with ordinary microscopy and\nanother using the magnifying properties of holograms,\nusually with auxiliary beam-forming optics. Since\nbiological and physical scientists make extensive use\nof microscopy, it is only natural that their findings\nhave been greatly enhanced by this new technology.\nHolography\'s greatest contribution to microscopy is\nits ability to freeze in three dimensions a transient\nevent occurring on a slide, thus allowing further\nexamination or interferometric comparison with similar events later.\nOne of the interesting current applications of the\ncommercial holographic microscope is the study of\ndynamic events such as crystallite and biological\ngrowth and bacteria movement, a critical area of\nmedical research. Another is holographic projection\nof images to assist in the manufacture of more\nreliable, less expensive, integrated circuits and microelectronic components.\nThe earliest method of holographic microscopythe one Gabor intended to use\xe2\x80\x94was to obtain\nmagnification by reconstructing the hologram with a\nlonger wavelength than that of the original recording.\nThe degree of magnification would equal the ratio of\nthe reconstruction to the recording wavelength.\nA purely geometric "lensless" approach investigated by E. Leith obtained magnification by decreasing the radius of curvature of the reference reconstruction beam as compared to the recording beam\n(fig. 22a). As can be seen, no optical element is\nplaced between the object and the hologram, hence\nthe designation "lensless." In this type of microscopy, relatively uncorrected lenses, like those shown\nin the diagram, are used to generate divergent\nspherical waves for object and reference beam illumi-\n\nnation. The processed, reconstructed real image can\nthen be examined at a variety of magnifications under\na conventional microscope. The major problems in\nthis approach are the presence of image aberrations\nand the relatively small factor of magnification\npossible (~100); great care must also be exercised to\navoid film shrinkage and distortion (refs. 93 through\n95).\nThe most practical approach developed so far is\ncalled the "corrected optics approach," in which\nPHOTOGRAPHIC\nPLATE\n\n,\n/\n\nHOLOGRAM\n\nb.\n\nFIGURE 22.-Holograph microscopy approaches.\n\nNOT FILMED\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n32\n\nFIGURE 23.-Holographic image of simulated lunar surface at 32X. (The left\nphotograph is focused approximately 0.2 mm deeper into the surface layer\nthan the right photograph.)\n\nholography is used in conjunction with ordinary\nmicroscopy. This method, introduced by R. F. van\nLigten, requires finely corrected microscope optics\nbetween the object and the hologram (fig. 22b). As a\nresult, the hologram does not require magnification\nupon reconstruction. The drawbacks of this method\nare that the field of view at the hologram plate is\nreduced by the microscope optics in an amount\ninversely proportional to the square of the magnification; and the depth of field is limited by the/number\n(ratio of focal length to diameter) of the correction\noptics. Resolution on the order of 1 pm is possible\nusing this system; it is the basis for the NASA work\nsupporting the testing of integrated circuits reported\nbelow (ref. 96).\nNASA RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nHolography of Integrated Circuits\nIn a study performed for ERC, R. F. van Ligten\ninvestigated the application of holographic microscopy to nondestructive testing of monolithic cir-\n\ncuits. The two prime conclusions reached by this\nstudy were:\n1. The holographic phenomenon of wave front\nstorage is applicable to microscopic failure\ndetection when the appropriate correlation\nbetween electric and optical behavior is established.\n2. Interference effects produced by integrated\ncircuit components (i.e., silicon wafers) in the\ninvisible infrared may be stored in holograms\nfor later visible reconstruction and diagnosis.\nOn the basis of these observations, van Ligten\nproposed that a microscopic hologram be made of an\nintegrated circuit at various stages during the manufacturing process. Electrical checkout of the unit at\nthe end, or at intermediate steps, would allow\ncorrelation of the electrical properties with the\nappearance of the optical hologram. In this way, a\nbaseline or reference set of holograms could be\nestablished. Viewing subsequent sample holograms\ninterferometrically over the reference holograms\nwould then show flaws in the unit at any stage in the\nprocess. Deviations in parameters such as depth of\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC MICROSCOPY\n\n33\n\nFIGURE 24.-Prototype holocamera interior: optics side.\n\netching, oxidation, or metallization are readily visible\nwith a resolution of 1/100 of the wavelength from\nthe illuminating source.\nThe reference hologram might also be generated\nby using a computer. This could be called a holographic test plate, and would be used in a manner\nvery similar to that of a test plate in optical\nfabrication\xe2\x80\x94the computer-generated hologram providing the prescribed contour. A hologram taken of\nthe unit in production would then be superimposed\nover the reference and viewed as a real-time hologram. An interference pattern of straight lines would\nindicate a perfect match (ch. 6). The computergenerated hologram can be of special importance in\n\nprototype stages where no previous holograms exist\nto verify the required contouring (ref. 97).\nMagnifying Holocamera\n\nUnder contract to NASA, D. Close of the Hughes\nResearch Laboratory has developed a prototype\nholocamera for possible use in the Apollo program.\nThe function of this camera is to take microscopic\nholograms of lunar surface material while the astronauts are on the moon. A holographic approach was\nchosen because of the requirement for a large\ndepth-of-field at high resolution. The returned holograms will allow scientists to scan the entire object\n\n34\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nFIGURE 25.-Commercial holographic microscope.\n\n35\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC MICROSCOPY\n\nvolume using a conventional microscope, a procedure\nwhich is not possible with ordinary microscopic\nphotography.\n\na remote automatic holographic microscope to study\nlife with landing probes also has begun.\n\nHolograms made of "artificial moondust" have\nalready shown good results (fig. 23). Magnification as\nhigh as 52 X has been used on the individual holograms with acceptable results. Speckle was apparent\nbut not very distracting; the superposition technique\nwas employed to reduce it.\nBecause this camera was developed for use on the\nlunar surface, it can function in an extreme thermal\nand vacuum environment and can withstand launch\nvibrations. These characteristics lend it ideal potential\nfor many other uses, including a portable holographic\ncamera for earth applications such as nondestructive\ntesting and remote interferometric measurements\n(ref. 98). Figure 24 shows the interior of this prototype\ncamera.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nCOMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS\nComplementing the knowledge gained during a\ncontract with ERC, American Optical has developed a\ncommercial holographic microscope (fig. 25) that\nallows comparison of successive dynamic events\nthrough either double-exposure time-differential\nholographic interferometry or real-time holographic\ninterferometry (ref. 99). Its basic principles of operation are diagrammed in figure 22b. This instrument\nmakes possible the observation and recording of all\nsorts of microscopic phenomena such as crystal\ngrowth, bacteria movement, and tissue growth; surface changes under such influences as heat, stress,\nfatigue, and flame; phase changes in transparent\nmaterials like nerve cells and plastic fibers; the\nreaction of liquid crystals, particles, and aerosols to\noutside influences; and remote data gathering.\nR. F. van Ligten has used this type of instrument\nto investigate fresh human blood cells for ERC, and\nthe Naval Medical Research Institute has used the\nsame technique to investigate the effect of pressurization on blood flow in the capillaries of a golden\nhamster\'s cheek pouch. An investigation of the use of\n\nA technique called the "uncorrected optics approach," attributed to L. Toth and S. A. Collins, may\nfind wide future application. It involves the insertion\nof a high f/n lens between the object and the\nhologram while recording, and subsequent use of the\nsame lens in the same position during reconstruction.\nThis approach achieves greater depth of focus and a\nlarger field of view; it eliminates during reconstruction the aberrations introduced while recording;\nand it relaxes the resolution requirements on the\nhologram material, since the magnified image is\nrecorded on the hologram. These characteristics may\nallow the use of less conventional holographic materials in the future.\nRepositioning the lens is obviously critical because\nthe aberrations are accentuated by poor positioning.\nSome image quality is also sacrificed with the\nlarge-diameter uncorrected lens. The uncorrected\noptics approach has already been used to study\ncrystal growth from the melt. Both the corrected and\nuncorrected optics methods (with a lens between the\nobject and the hologram) allow standard microscopic\ntechniques during reconstruction. Thus, dark-field\nillumination and phase-contrast microscopy are possible without altering the hologram. For this reason,\nthese two methods show the most promise for\npotential use (refs. 93, 100 and 101).\nOne variation of holographic microscopy is the\nprojection of highly reduced images onto integrated\ncircuit materials that are to be etched. The direct\nprojection of the image into the photoresist layer\nusing a lensless hologram seems a promising way to\neliminate the intermediate photographic mask now\nused during integrated circuit production. These\nmasks are unreliable and have short lifetimes. The\nalternative of using conventional image projection\nrequires highly corrected and costly optical components and systems (ref. 102).\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nHolographic Interf erometry\nNASA RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nAn exciting and major practical application of\nwavefront reconstruction was discovered early in the\ndevelopment of holography. Several independent\ngroups of workers discovered more or less simultaneously that two or more three-dimensional holographic images could be compared by a simple\nsuperimposition. The most significant aspect of this\nphenomenon is that the nature of the two or more\ncomparable holographic images can be greatly varied.\nBoth can be stored and recorded on the same film, or\nrecorded on separate firms and then superimposed on\neach other. A stored image and a real object can be\nsuperimposed for comparison in real time. The object\nbeams used to form the holograms can be transmitted\nthrough the subject or reflected from a moving\nsubject. Furthermore, the time interval between\ngeneration of the separate holograms can be varied\nfrom a few tens of nanoseconds to days or even years.\nIf the two or more holographic images are not\nidentical, then "interaction fringes" are formed from\nthe composite superimpositions. These threedimensional fringe structures describe any differences\nbetween the exposures caused by movement of the\nobject or by a change in the amplitude or phase of\nthe object or reference beam. Thus a change in the\ndensity or index of refraction of the media through\nwhich the light beams are propagated, or a shift of\nthe reference beam source location or light frequency, can be readily detected. All of these principles are used in forming various types of interference\nholograms and are the basis for the holographic\napplications described here. These types of interferometric images can be obtained with continuous\nwave lasers of modest power or with extremely high\npower Q or mode-locked switched pulse lasers.\nThis great flexibility in laser requirements and in\nsetup complexity makes possible the application of\nholographic interferometry techniques to a very wide\nspectrum of scientific and commercial needs.\n\nNASA activities in interferometric holography\nmay be summarized by the following list:\nEvaluation of arc lamps\nContour measurement\nMechanical vibration and shock analysis\nContinuous wave vibration mapping\nFlow visualization\nNondestructive testing\nFilm and surface contamination measurement\nConstruction defect determination\nMaterial evaluation\nQuantitative interferometry\nSubfringe measurement and detection\nWind tunnel, shock tube and ballistic range\nmeasurement and monitoring\nTwo applications developed by NASA have already shown commercial worth. Holographic methods have been used to accurately measure the surface\ncontours of microwave antennas up to 9 ft in\ndiameter, at time and cost savings compared to\nprevious methods. Holographic evaluation of high\nintensity lamps has led to the successful design of\nhigher intensity arc lamps, and the same technique\ncan probably be applied to production lamp testing\nor as an aid in the design of longer burning lamps.\nEvaluation of Arc Lamps\n\nOne of the most successful NASA applications for\ninterferometric holography was in understanding\ncompact arc lamps, leading to the design of brighter,\nmore efficient xenon compact arc lamps. At 800 nm,\nthe luminance of these lamps was increased about 30\npercent by correspondingly decreasing the area of the\narc spot. This modification in design was possible\nafter detailed study of the efficiency of heat dissipated from the anode tip due to the convection flow\n37\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\n38\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nof gas over the anode. A holographic interferogram of\nthe area around the anode tip disclosed the fringe\nshifts in the gas layers adjacent to the anode surface,\nand these clues to the nature of the gas flow provided\nthe means of improving the design to increase the\noutput of light.\n\nA hologram of this type (fig. 26) is formed by a\ndouble exposure from a pulsed laser. The first\nexposure is made with the lamp in place but not\noperating; the second exposure is made a few seconds\nlater after the lamp has achieved an equilibrium state\nat a full operating condition. The difference fringes\n\nFIGURE 26.-Holographic inteiferogram of operating arc lamp.\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY\n\n39\n\nare thus due to a change in medium within the lamp\nthrough which the object beam passes. Amplitude\nand phase shifts in this medium are caused by the\nvarying temperatures and densities of the gas layers in\nthe proximity of the anode (ref. 103).\nPotential applications appear to exist, based on\nthese developments, for investigating a variety of\nfluid flow and heat transfer phenomena. Likely\ncandidates are such processes as nucleate boiling of\ncooling fluid within the anode, flow in the expansion\nthroat of a C02 gas dynamic laser, modes of\ncryopumping action, convection of gas paths and\nsurface turbulence in a flowing gas, and deformation\nand creep of surfaces caused by gas absorption.\nContour Measurement\n\nHolography has recently been applied by the TRW\nSystems Group to accurate measurement (0.001 in.)\nof the shape changes of large parabolic antennas (9 ft\ndiameter) under space-simulated conditions. The antennas are placed within a continuously pumped\nvacuum chamber, with front and side solar simulators\nto visualize the deformation of the antenna surfaces\nunder full sun, side sun, and simulated deep eclipse.\nPreviously, photogrammetry had been used to make\nmeasurements to an accuracy of 0.002 in., but this\nprocess involved visual scanning of stereophotographs\nand delayed plotting of a contour map under computer control (ref. 104).\nTRW developed under separate contract a holographic interferometer technique and instrumentation\nfor producing contour maps on a near real-time basis\n(fig. 27). The technique was first discovered during an\ninvestigation of holographic instrumentation for\nARC. It was observed that if an object was illuminated by a pulsed laser emitting two displace frequencies simultaneously, range contours were generated on the hologram of the object. Previously,\nrange contours had been observed only when objects\nwere righted by two separate continuous wave (cw)\nfrequencies from two different lasers. Figure 28a\nshows the generation of range contours 23 mm apart\nby two neighboring frequencies, while figure 28b\nshows 8-mm contours generated by frequencies\nfarther apart (refs. 105 through 108).\nThis contouring technique was the basis for a\nNASA Tech Brief describing an optical long-range\ncontour mapping concept for which NASA has a\npatent application. The single pulse aspect of this\n\nFIGURE 27.-Holographic contour map of a portion\nof a spacecraft microwave antenna.\n\ntechnique makes possible its application even to\nmoving objects. However, a major limitation of its use\nat long ranges is the enormous laser power level\nrequired (ref. 109).\n\nMechanical Vibration and Shock Analysis\n\nImpressive gains in the understanding of mechanical vibrational and shock processes have been made\nthrough special holographic analyses. Several NASA\ncenters and at least three contractors have been active\nin this area of technology. Experiments have been\nconducted with the loading of thin-walled cylindrical\nshells; wave propagation in circular cylindrical and\nconical shells; vibrational modes of heated plates;\ntransverse vibrations of beams and plates; wave\npropagation in beams; and vibration, flutter, and\ntransient analysis of thin metallic panels.\nJPL recently completed a series of definitive\nexperiments establishing a partial explanation for the\npremature failure of thin shells under a buckling load.\nFigure 29 shows a series of holographic fringe\npatterns illustrating the growth of prebuckling imperfections that contribute to the initial failure of the\n\n40\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nFIGURE 28a.-Initial discovery of holographic contours\n(with 23-mm interval).\n\nFIGURE 28b.-Holographic contours with 8-mm interval.\n\nshell. Double-exposure holographic interferometry is\nan ideal technique for this measurement. It is a\nnoncontact technique and also allows mapping the\nentire surface at once. The equipment setup is a\nnormal type of double-exposure reflection holography, using a small increase in compression load\nbetween each exposure (refs. 110 and 111).\nVibrating beams and plates have been studied with\nstrain gages or capacitive displacement sensors for\nsome time. However, these devices cannot simultaneously measure all the points along a vibrating\nstructure, and the devices themselves may disturb the\nnatural vibrational modes of the test piece. Another\nconventional research method is the formation of\nChladni sand patterns at lower frequency vibrational\n\nlevels, but this requires level positioning of the test\npiece, and the resulting patterns only indicate the\nnodal lines, not the shapes. Holographic interferometry can overcome all these limitations.\nThe experimental arrangement used by TRW to\nmeasure transverse vibrational modes of a cantilever\nbeam is shown in figure 30 (refs. 112 and 114). A\nsimpler experimental setup was arranged to take\ntime-averaged reflection holograms of an excited\nplate. The plate was a simply supported sheet of\naluminum 8 in. wide by 10 in. long by 1/16 in. thick.\nFigure 31 is a hologram of the plate in its normal\nmode, while figure 32 shows a high frequency modal\npattern. At a frequency of 20 892 Hz, the 13th order\nhorizontal and the 11th order vertical harmonics have\nbeen excited, and the center point of the plate,\nattached to the driving transducer, is distorted (note\nhow dark it is). These holograms were taken by a\ntime-averaged exposure, but the experimental conditions were first adjusted to stable resonant frequencies by viewing the plate through a stored beam\nhologram in real time (refs. 112 through 115).\nRecently a NASA contractor began measuring the\nvibrational modes of plates between 1000 and\n2200\xc2\xb0 F to study the stress and strain expected on the\npanels of the space shuttle. One of the major\nproblems associated with such measurement is the\ndistortion of the holographic fringes caused by\nconvection currents adjacent to the heated test\nspecimen. This problem has been solved by using\ndouble-pulse interferometric holography. The interval\nbetween the pulses is shortened to 50 /zsec, and the\nrelative phase of these pulses with respect to the\nvibrational amplitude of the plate can be carefully\ncontrolled. In this short time interval, the thermal\nconvection currents introduce negligible fringe shifts,\nso that the vibration modes of the plate can be\nobserved without interference.\nIncluded in this same work was a study of the\ndetails of mechanical wave propagation in circular\ncylindrical and conical shells with and without flaws\nand cutouts. The progress of the waves traveling along\nthese structures was determined by a series of\ndouble-pulsed holograms and compared with a computer analysis. The results of the reduced holograms\nwere expressed graphically in terms of radial displacement versus axial position along an aluminum shell.\nHolographic analysis is expected to aid in development of wave propagation theory and to effect\nimproved methods of detecting and measuring the\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY\n\n41\n\nFIGURE 29.\xe2\x80\x94Thin shell interferogram at various prebuckling loads\n(a-72%, b-77%, c-S\n\neffect of structural flaws on the strength and endurance of mechanical members (refs. 116 through 118).\nContinuous Wave Vibration Mapping\n\nGreat progress has been made by ARC in establishing the time-averaged holographic method in an\noperational test facility. The cw work previously\ndiscussed required that all parts, including the cantilever beam, be mounted on an 8000-lb granite table,\nshock-isolated from the laboratory surroundings. R.\nBrown of ARC has devised a fringe stabilization\nsystem that seems to bring cw holographic interferometry closer to commercial realization. The\npurpose of this system is to prevent the motion of\nfringes during exposure of the hologram, even if some\nof the optical components or test pieces are not\ncompletely isolated and immobile (fig. 33).\nBasically the beam combiner located behind the\nholographic plate is designed to monitor the type of\nfringe at a given point and determine the movement\nof a fringe across the hologram. The photodetector\nand servo-electronics translate the speed and direction\nof the fringe\'s movement into a command to change\nthe path length of the reference beam to the hologram\nand thus stabilize the fringe\'s position. This is\nindicated by a constant signal to the photodetector.\nThe extent of the stabilization possible depends on\nthe type of motion to be compensated; linear motion\ncan be compensated equally across the whole hologram, but rotational motion can be stabilized exactly\nonly at a single point.\n\n534-778 O-74\xe2\x80\x944\n\nPlans have been made to use this vibration\nmapping system to study structural prefailures, correlations of failures with mechanical tests, and optimum shaketable excitation points for complex structures. Certain transient phenomena of a nonrecurrent\nnature are not suitable for analysis with cw holography, but this vibration mapping system is flexible\nenough to be used with pulsed lasers for such\ninvestigations (refs. 119 and 120).\nNASA has also been investigating complex techniques for modulating the phase of the reference\nbeam to vibrating and fluttering thin metallic panels.\nTwo specific techniques have been demonstrated: (1)\nshifting the phase of the reference beam with respect\nto the object and (2) using a shuttered laser system to\nstrobe the illumination and reference beams and\n"freeze" fringe motion. The phase of the observed\nnodal fringe patterns may be determined; i.e.,\nwhether a given bright fringe on the hologram was\ncaused by a node or an antinode vibrational pattern\n(refs. 121 and 122).\nFlow Visualization\n\nHolography has been studied by NASA Centers as\na way of making visible elusive changes in fluid flow,\nfluid temperature, and fluid density associated with\naerodynamic phenomena, thermal gradients, liquid\nflow constructions, rocket nozzles, and expansion\nchambers. Such work at LRC, ARC, and MSFC has\ncentered on means of monitoring the dynamic events\noccurring in wind tunnels and rocket test stands.\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n42\n\nMl(Mirror)\n\nCW\n\nLASER\n\nBS(Beam Splitter)\n\nM2(Mirror\n\nM4(Mirror)\n\nDl(Diffuser)\n\nLI(Lens)\n\n6(Mirror)\n\nCOS\n\nwt\n\nCANTILEVER\nFIGURE 30.\xe2\x80\x94Apparatus used in making holograms in the cantilever beam.\n\nEarly development at LRC to replace the conventional shadowgraphs and Schlieren techniques used in\nwind tunnels led to establishment of flow visualization techniques using holographic moire patterns.\nThese earlier photographic techniques allowed qualitative flow analyses that could not quantitatively\nmeasure density, temperature, or pressure. Quantita-\n\ntive devices also had drawbacks: The use of probes\nchanged the original flow pattern, and conventional\ninterferometers required costly, high-quality transmission optics and highly precise mechanical adjustments that could be affected by wind tunnel vibrations.\nThe LRC workers found that using superimposed\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY\n\n43\n\nFIGURE 31.-Hologram of fundamental mode of plate-162 Hz.\n\nmoire fringe patterns produced holographicaUy from\na cw laser would solve all these problems except for\nvibration, and that even the sensitivity to vibrations\ncould be reduced. The fringe pattern could be\nmonitored in real time and did not require as precise\na repositioning of the original hologram as is required\nwith other holographic methods. Changes in the test\nsection produce a magnified perturbation of the\nnormal moire fringe pattern, and the sensitivity of the\nsystem can be increased by increasing the spacing\nbetween the fringes (in the limit, this is called the\ninfinite fringe width condition). Figure 34 shows\nthese principles applied to a candle and its heated air\nstream.\nARC and the TRW Systems Group have also\nexperimented with finite fringe holograms, and\nNASA Tech Briefs have been published on the subject\n(refs. 123 through 125). Investigations at ARC have\n\nculminated in development of a full-scale operational\ntest facility to monitor, measure, and visualize flow\nfields in a wind tunnel (ref. 126).\nNondestructive Testing\n\nNondestructive testing of all types of mechanical\nand aerospace structures is of great practical interest.\nAlthough most of the holographic techniques developed for this purpose have not conclusively established their worth, they have given very favorable\nindications of successful performance during feasibility tests.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Research at MSFC is in progress, ranging from\nthe testing of titanium welds to arrangements\nfor monitoring contaminated optical test blanks\nin space.\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n44\n\nFIGURE 32.-High-frequency model hologram.\n\nBEAM\nSPLITTER\nBEAM COMBINER\n\nPHOTO DETECTOR\nPIEZO ELECTRIC\nMIRROR MOUNT\n\nSERVO ELECTRONICS\n\nFIGURE 33.-Servosystem showing fringe monitor.\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY\n\nfinite fringes\n\n45\n\ninfinite fringe\n\nFIGURE 34.-Real-time flow visualization using holographic moire patterns.\n\nGSFC and MSFC are planning holographic\ninterferometric test facilities to measure simulated space flight effects on various spacecraft\nsystems and components and to develop methods for quantitative nondestructive testing of\nspacecraft structures.\nLRC and its contractors are developing techniques to test bonded and honeycomb materials\nand to detect microcracks in structures.\nJPL has shown the feasibility of testing solid\npropellants for defects, indicating a strong\npotential for application to a number of different materials.\nARC and its contractors, TRW and the\nUniversity of Arkansas, have developed techniques to monitor subfringe changes of holographic interference patterns.\nThe University of Michigan, although under\ncontract to NASA for a number of years, has\nindependently discovered and developed several\n\nadvances in applying holography to additional\nfields and situations (see next section).\nSome of the most extensive work in holographic\nnondestructive testing has been carried out in J.\nWilliam\'s group at MSFC. He recently pointed out\nthat although the three major types of interferometry\n(time-averaging, double-exposure, and real-time)\nproduce about the same quality of interaction fringe\npatterns, the quantitative contrast of these fringe\npatterns as a function of their order which is\nproportional to displacement distance differs markedly. This difference is seemingly a detail of the\nprocess, but it can have a significant impact on\npractical results. The three principle cases (fig. 35)\nclearly show that if the added complications and\ncomplexities can be tolerated, double-exposure interferometry should give higher contrast, especially if\ndisplacements exceed a few wavelength orders. It also\nshows the importance of adjusting the pattern by\nfringe control so that the nodal fringe, zero order,\noccurs near the fault or defect (ref. 127).\n\n46\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n1.0 -K\n\nKAs\n\na.

Real-time holography\nFIGURE 35.-Contrast comparison of three types of holographic interferometry.\n\nFilm and Surface Contamination Measurement\n\nSpace probes, vehicles, and stations orbiting near\nearth or passing through the tenuous upper atmosphere of earth or other planets are expected to be\nbombarded by particle clouds and contaminated by\nthe absorption or adsorption of thin films of foreign\nmaterial. The effects of these foreign deposits on the\nlifetime and performance of space systems is of\nconsiderable interest to NASA. For example, such\ndeposits on the entrance aperture of earth resourcessurveillance-sensor systems could seriously attenuate\nand distort the incident energy.\nInstrumentation has been developed at MSFC to\nrecord this buildup of contaminates on a transparent\nor reflecting substrate in a simulated space environment. The substrate is contained in a vacuum\nchamber. Figure 36 is a double-exposure interferogram taken on an earlier system showing fringes\nproduced by a thick contaminating oil film. The film\nwas smeared on the optical flat between the first and\n\nsecond exposure. Quartz crystal microbalances will be\nplaced in the vacuum system to collect deposited\nmass data to be correlated with recordings or motion\npictures of the interferograms; deposit of films or\nparticles will be recorded or viewed in real time.\nThe new system concept (fig. 37) can record either\na reflectance or a double pass transmittance hologram, or both simultaneously, depending on whether\nthe substrate is semitransmitting. Such a dual system\nto record the weight and the thickness of foreign\nparticulate or film buildup will have wide application.\nThe major limitation at present is the thickness of the\nfilm that can be detected. The systems just described\ncan measure thickness down to 0.32 jum. The use of\nultraviolet interferograms increases the sensitivity to\n0.17 p.m. In addition, NASA has been doing considerable work on subfringe holographic interferometry,\nand these techniques are potentially capable of\ndetermining thicknesses of 1.7 to 3 nm.\nThese techniques may also solve nonaerospace\nproblems involving measurement of thickness or\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY\n\nFIGURE 36.-Double-exposure holographic image\nof contaminated optical flat.\n\nuniformity of a substance over an area. For example,\na bottle manufacturer might need to determine the\nuniformity of a plastic coating applied to his bottles\nduring fabrication (refs. 127 through 130).\nConstruction Defect Determination\n\nThe holographic detection of construction defects\nor material faults has been intensively investigated by\nNASA. MSFC was able to detect faults in a metal-tometal weld between two pieces of titanium declared\nperfect by x-ray analysis. When an entire printed\ncircuit board was recorded as a holographic interferogram, areas of suspect construction and questionable\nsolder joints could be determined from the image\n(refs. 128 and 129).\nMajor work on developing techniques for the\nanalysis of faulty material or structures has been\ncarried on by United Aircraft Research Laboratory\n(UARL) and LRC. UARL has completed an extensive\nstudy on composite samples, consisting of various\nmultiple-ply, layered arrangements of boron- and\ncarbon-epoxy, previously bonded and then sandwiched between aluminum and titanium substrates\n\n47\n\nwith adhesives. Each sample was fabricated with deliberate flaws between the sandwich substrates: For\nexample, steel bags and teflon spacers were inserted\nin place of the prepregnated layers. Attempts to\nfabricate flaws caused by weak adhesives between the\nlayers and the substrates were not successful.\nThe prepared samples were examined by holographic cw interferometric techniques and by infrared\nscanning. Real-time viewing was used to determine\nthermal stress reactions, while time-average holography was used to record interferograms of the\nacoustically excited samples. The time-average interferograms proved better than infrared pictures for\ndetecting these flaws, and much better than thermal\nstressing. Reliability of detection was not uniformly\nhigh for all samples, however, and different modes\nhad to be excited to reveal all observed flaws.\nSeveral obstacles must be overcome with this\ntechnique. A method must be found to introduce\ngreater amounts of acoustic energy into the test\nspecimen, and relationships between detected flaw\nsize or shape and overall structural strength must be\nfound if the results are to be properly interpreted.\nLRC is pursuing the problem of determining the\nstrength of a weak bond as contrasted with detection\nand location of a total disbond (ref. 132).\nThis interferometric technique has also proved\nmore reliable than other methods in detecting disbonds in composites made of honeycomb paper cores\nand aluminum sandwiches. Such composites are being\nused by the Army for constructing portable hardwall\nbuildings (ref. 135).\nMaterial Evaluation\n\nAn intriguing use for holography is the detection\nof small microcracks and flaws in various types of\nmaterial. Work is under way at LRC to apply such\ntechniques to aerospace structure testing and monitoring. The University of Michigan has studied the\ndetection of radial microcracks extending from bolt\nholes in high strength aircraft steel, and has also done\nextensive studies of stress corrosion cracks (see next\nsection). Although microcracks can be detected by\nconventional inspection techniques such as dye penetrants, Magnaflux, and visual examination, these\nmethods normally require careful cleaning of the\nsurface plus microscopic examination. Holography is\nbetter suited to periodic structural tests on aircraft,\nrockets, tunnel walls, and building structures.\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n48\n\nPHOTOGRAPHIC\nPLATE\n\nOPTICAL\nSAMPLE\n\nC O L L I M A T I M G LEHS e\nPIHHOLE -\n\nPIHHOLE\n\n.\xe2\x80\x9e-\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\'"\nBEAM S P L I T T E R *\n\nLENS\n\nBEAM\nDIRECTOR\n\nMIRROR\n\nC A M E R A SHUTTER\n\nFIGURE 37.-Optical layout of holographic thin film analyzer.\n\nQuantitative Interferometry\n\nAlthough fringes can be interpreted to indicate a\ntotal system shift of one or one-half wavelengths, this\ntotal system change cannot always be translated\neasily back to a corresponding change in the object or\nspecimen under test. For example whether an object\nis translated or rotated between or during exposures\nwill greatly affect the characteristics of the interferogram. The direction from which the object beam falls\non the subject and the reference beam falls on the\nhologram affects the fringe pattern. Strictly speaking,\nthe exact direction of motion, even if it is a straight\ntranslation, cannot be determined without using three\ninterferograms, one for each component of motion.\nThe situation becomes far more complex when a\npartially transparent subject is considered; then the\nthree-dimensional fringe volume extends both within\nand out beyond the subject.\nAt MSFC, some analysis has been done on fringes\nproduced by a general rotation and translation of a\nminor object between exposures. In a similar series of\nexperiments at GSFC, experimental measurements,\ndetermined holographically, were compared to the\n\nangular rotations measured by an autocollimator and\nan inclinometer (refs. 135 through 137). Further\nprojects on quantitative interpretation of holographic\ninterferograms are planned by Manned Spacecraft\nCenter (MSC) and the University of Michigan, especially the measurement and evaluation of object\ndeformations under mechanical stress (ref. 138).\n\nSub fringe Measurement and Detection\n\nOne of the greatest limitations in holographic\ninterferometry is the difficulty of varying its sensitivity. For example it might sometimes be desirable\nto make a fringe shift represent different values of\ndisplacement or movement, to read out intervals\nmuch less than a fringe, or to count fringe differences\naccurately in the presence of many closely spaced\nfringes.\nOne approach to this problem involves varying the\nwavelength of the laser light, which slightly alters the\nmagnitude of the change of surface displacement\ncausing a fringe shift. A second approach is recording\na single exposure hologram with two simultaneous\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY\nfrequencies, which greatly desensitizes the fringe contours (ch. 3). A third approach is fringe control.\nFringe control can be thought of as a method of\nshifting certain higher order fringes on the interferogram to zero or low order fringes. It can lessen the\nproblem but not eliminate it. ARC is expecting\nfurther progress from its work in developing subfringe\nmeasurement techniques. Another significant contribution is expected to result from the application of\nthe principle of generalized reference beam modulation, discovered and developed from C. AleksofPs\nresearch.\nARC, in close cooperation with the TRW Systems\nGroup, has pioneered in subfringe interferometry.\nTheir efforts began after the discovery that interferometric holograms made of high velocity, low pressure\nair flows exhibited very few fringes. The series of\nearly TRW double-exposure holograms shown in\nfigure 38 were taken in a ballistic range at progressively lower atmospheric pressures, down to a minimum of 6 mm of mercury. Although a few fringes\nremain at 60 mm, only about 1 to 1/2 at the most\nremain at the lowest pressure. These interferograms\nwere made by taking the first pulse exposure before\narrival of the bullet and the second exposure 100\nMsec later with the bullet in view.\nThe earliest attempts at subfringe measurement\nwere based on shifting the phase of the subject beam\n180 degrees between exposures of a regular doubleexposed holographic interferogram. Exact 180-degree\nphase shift and precisely equal laser amplitude exposures are difficult to stabilize, however, so the "four\nbeam subfringe interferometer" and other such techniques are useful only for applications requiring\nqualitative results on the order of tenths of a fringe\nsensitivity (refs. 139 and 140).\nResearchers at the University of Arkansas Institute\nof Technology, under NASA contract, have developed a very versatile technique called "dual exposure\nholographic interferometry with separate reference\nbeams" (ref. 141). This technique particularly lends\nitself to subfringe measurement, but it can also be\nused to obtain finite and infinite fringe interferograms, shadowgraphs, and Schlieren holograms and\nphotographs. As implied by the name, two reference\nbeams instead of one are used in making a doubleexposure interferogram. During the reconstruction,\nthe phases between the two reference beams can be\nvaried to accentuate features of the hologram. This\ndifference can be used to measure the subfringe\n\n49\n\ndistance between the corresponding image points of\nthe hologram accurately to phase angles as small as\n1.5 degrees or 1/240 of a fringe (refs. 141 and 142).\nThese techniques have not been successfully applied to examining the high velocity, low pressure\nflows of wind tunnels, shock tubes, and ballistic\nchambers, primarily because of the highly unstable\nturbulent boundary layers that plague these devices\nand the high levels of vibration and flow transients.\nThey should, however, prove useful in more moderate\nenvironments such as the measurement of thin fibers,\nparticulate buildups, or birefringent anisotropic partially transparent objects (refs. 131).\nCOMMERCIAL ENDEAVORS\n\nProduction line testing of large aircraft panels\nthrough commercial holography has been going on\nfor over 2 years, with considerable cost savings\ncompared to the former ultrasonic and x-ray testing\nmethods. Another aircraft application using holography has been the testing and data gathering for\nredesign of turbine blades and other jet engine\ncomponents before the units are assembled. This\nprocess has substantially reduced costly jet engine\nfailures during final test runs.\nAlthough at present these two aircraft applications\nare the only ones that have demonstrated savings,\nmany of the other applications listed in this section\nwill probably show similar results. One promising area\nis the holographic testing of commercial tires to select\nthose suitable for recapping. Much research and\ndevelopment remains to be done, however, before\nholographic interferometry is an established commercial technique that is both technologically and financially feasible.\nNondestructive Testing of Aircraft Panels and Honeycomb Structure\n\nRohr Corporation (Chula Vista, California) has\nbeen using cw interferometric holography for the past\n2-1/2 years to test aircraft honeycomb panel structures such as wing or body sections. The commercial\nequipment used can accommodate panels 20 ft long\nand 6 ft wide. Tests are routinely made on the first\nhoneycomb qualification panel assembly bonded by\neach production tool. These panels used to be\ndestructively tested, but the present method of\nholographic testing in conjunction with ultrasonic\n\n50\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nFIGURE 38.-Double-exposure holographic interferogram at various\nchamber pressures.\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY\nand x-ray nondestructive test equipment is cheaper\nand quicker.\nRohr has used two types of commercial equipment: The first unit (fig. 39) has an argon laser as a\ncoherent light source, while the second, smaller unit\nuses a helium-neon laser (fig. 40). The panel to be\ninspected is held in place with a series of vacuum\ncups. After in-place development of the unstressed\npanel\'s hologram, the area to be inspected is heated a\nfew degrees above ambient. Irradiation of both the\npanel and the static hologram by the laser source then\nallows the operator to view interferometric fringes in\nreal time. Proper interpretation of the fringe field\nidentifies debonding of the skin to the core and areas\nof crushed core.\nThe small unit can inspect about 2.2 sq m of panel\nper hour, while the larger unit can handle up to 5.6 sq\nm per hour. These test rates are from four to five\ntimes faster than ultrasonics, and more than make up\nthe initial double investment cost of the holographic\nsystem over the ultrasonics unit. The manufacturer\nhas concluded that the cost ratio for nondestructive\n\n51\n\ntesting using x-rays is 1.5 to 1, ultrasonic testing is 8\nto 1, and holography is 1 to 1. These ratios are based\non maximum production test rates, 80 percent\nmachine utilization, machine lease, materials, and\nlabor costs (ref. 143).\nThe typical appearance of debonds on these panels\nis shown in figure 41. The Rohr Corporation has\nstated that the holographic test system does not\nexperience a false alarm problem as such, but "you\ndo have to know your structure." The positions of\nirregularities such as edge members, steps, and transition points must be known, because each of these\ncharacteristics has its own signature that could be\nconfused with a true defect. There are over 100\ndifferent configurations of test pieces and the test\nengineer must be familiar with the holographic\npeculiarities of each piece (ref. 144).\nNondestructive Test Equipment for Tires and Brakes\n\nA commercial tire tester that uses holographic\ntechniques is being studied in the research and\n\nFIGURE 39.-Laige holographic system.\n\n52\n\nHOLOGRAPHYS SURVEY\n\nFIGURE 40.-Small holographic system.\n\ndevelopment departments of major tire and auto\nmanufacturers such as Royal, Firestone, Goodyear,\nand General Motors (fig. 42). The device makes a\ndoubly exposed cw hologram of the tire\'s inner\nsurface; one exposure is made while the tire is\nsubjected to a partial vacuum under the bell hood,\nthe other at normal atmospheric pressure. The photograph in figure 43 shows a reconstructed hologram of\na tire with a suspect region (indicated by fringe\nanomalies) where there may be separations between\ntread and sidewall; this tire later failed a wheel test.\nThe holographic test can simplify selection of tires\nfor retread (ref. 145 and 146).\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) is in the\nmidst of an extensive program to correlate potential\ntire faults revealed by holographic, x-ray, ultrasonic,\nand infrared tests with actual wheel and road tests.\n\nDOT will be establishing both minimum standards\nand means of evaluating tires against these standards.\nAt present, Dr. Knabe of DOT believes that for every\nreal fault revealed by holographic testing there are\nmany irregularities that may prove to be false alarms.\nThis analyzer may soon be examining automobile,\ntruck, and aircraft tires for carcass ply separations,\nbelt edge separations, tread and sidewall separations,\nmultiple cord fracture, porosity and voids, and\ncarcass and belt damage (refs. 142 and 143).\nJet Engine and Turbine Testing\n\nPratt & Whitney Aircraft currently redesigns jet\nengine parts and components on the basis of holographic analysis. These cw holograms exposed in a\ntime-averaged mode have revealed serious anomalies\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY\n\nFIGURE 41.-Debonds on adhesive-bonded honeycomb aircraft panels.\n\n53\n\n54\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nFIGURE 42.-Commercial holographic tire tester.\n\nin engine component performance that would prevent\nthe assembled engine from performing properly or\ncause a premature component failure.\nA reconstructed time-averaged interferogram of\nthe original turbine blades designed for a certain jet\nengine (fig. 44) shows that the blades resonated in the\nlowest frequency or first bending mode at a frequency of 7986 Hz, just short of the requirement for\nthis engine\'s component (8000 Hz without resonances). Three subsequent redesign efforts, characterized respectively as long chord, quick fix, and\nshort chord, changed the modal characteristics and\nresonance frequencies (fig. 45). The quick fix and\nshort chord adjustment successfully raised the first\nfrequency bending mode out of the danger zone,\nwhile the initial long chord adjustment was unsuccessful.\nHolography of this type is used on a routine basis\nto determine the need for redesign of various engine\ncomponents such as jet burner cans, turbine blades,\nspray-bars, and inlet flaps. After design, all these\ncomponents have passed their tests. The potential for\nthis kind of testing is extremely promising. Pratt &\nWhitney is making plans to use computer assisted\ndesigns of prototype turbine blades. The computer\n\nFIGURE 43.-Reconstructed hologram of suspect defects on\ntire.\n\ninput will be holographic fringe data from test\nphotographs of the sample blade and equations of the\nblade\'s mechanical design and required performance.\nThe output will be the necessary design changes for\nthe blade. An objective for the future is to have the\ncomputer actually construct a digital hologram of the\nnewly designed blade that could be used to reconstruct a three-dimensional image. Consideration is\nalso being given to analysis of the fringe pattern\nphotographs by microdensitometer for direct input\ninto the computer (ref. 147).\nBall and Roller Bearing Transient Measurements\n\nA very practical use of holography has been made\nby Naval researchers who used double-pulse, Qswitched, ruby laser holography to determine the\nnature and magnitude of minute deformations of ring\nball bearings as they rotated about a loaded shaft.

It is vital to reduce these effects to a\nminimum, since they can transmit spurious vibrations\nto the rotating shafts and machinery and are believed\nto be the major cause of bearing housing oxidation\nand corrosion. Before this holographic technique was\ndeveloped to make measurements at operating speeds,\ngeometric changes in a bearing could be measured\nmechanically only when the bearing rotated at speeds\nconsiderably below normal operating conditions.\nHolography also seems to be useful in determining\nthe symmetry of loading and misalignment of the ball\nbearings (ref. 148).\n\nFIGURE 45 .-Holograms of turbine blade after three redesigns: long chord, quick fix, and short chord.\n\nelement that generates an electrical output signal. The\nouter circumference of the diaphragm is bonded to\nthe hollow base of the transducer, and propei\noperation of the transducer requires that this bond be\nstable and reproducible. Interferometric holography\nwas used as a diagnostic tool to aid in development of\na suitable bonding technique. It allowed measurements to be made of the mechanical deflection of the\ndiaphragm. Although the electric output signal could\nhave been used to analyze the bond characteristics, it\nwas discarded because of expense and complexity\n(ref. 149).\n\nPressure Transducer Investigation\n\nThe Babcock and Wilcox Co.

A group at the Arnold Engineering Development Center has developed six operational systems\nfor inline and off-axis holography that can be set up\nat various aerodynamic test and experimental facilities. Most of the systems use pulsed lasers in single- or\ndouble-exposure modes, either with a diffuser for\nthree-dimensional display and interferometry or without a diffuser for Schlieren visualization, interferometry, or various types of spatial filtering. These\nsystems provide the following types of routine testing\ndata that are otherwise unobtainable (ref. 150):\nVaporization and condensation phenomena in\nfuel tanks\nMaterial introduced into the wake of an aerodynamic model\nAnalysis of droplet characteristics in simulated\nhigh altitude engine icing\n\nDust characteristics in dust erosion facility\nEfficiency of particulate catchers in aerodynamic flows\nRocket exhaust particulate measurement\nE. Campaigne* developed for GCO, Inc., a compact cw holographic system designed to be strapped\nonto the system or component to be tested. An\narrangement of this kind helps the holography of\nnormally vibrating test objects, since the relative\nmotion of vibration between the holocamera parts\nand the test object is minimized (fig. 46).\nNormally, when a test object is stressed either\nthermally or by mechanical force, the entire object is\n\n*Now with Radar and Optics Laboratory, University of\nMichigan\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY\ndeformed and shows general fringe changes, but the\nweak areas show greater deformation. A novel feature\nof this holocamera is that the fringe pattern can be\naltered by changing the position of the reference\nsource beam. It is therefore possible to shift the\ngeneral fringe pattern caused by the general deformation to accentuate anomalies caused by a particular\ndefect. Before the interferometric photograph in\nfigure 47 was taken, two small points were centerpunched on the front side; the fringes were then\nmade to center on these slightly elevated points on\nthe back side of a small steel plate (refs. 151 and\n152).\nDetection of Stress Corrosion Flaws and Cracks\n\nradial crack whose location and length can be\ndetected only by discontinuities of slope in the fringe\nlines at about the 2:00 o\'clock position from the pin\nis illustrated in figure 49b. These specimens were\nstressed by drawing a hardened bolt with a taperered\nshank into the hole, and a normal cw double\nexposure hologram was made of the undisturbed and\nstressed states of the specimens (ref. 152 and 153).\nModulated Reference Beam Holography\n\nThe discovery of C. Aleksoff and his colleagues at\nthe University of Michigan may be the most significant breakthrough since the first time-averaged hologram was made by Haines and Hinderbrand. Basically\n\nStress corrosion is the formation of small microcracks due to internal tension and corrosion of the\nspecimen, without externally applied stress or loads.\nHolographic interferometry can detect such cracking\nprocesses early if they manifest themselves by displacing the surface of the test specimen. A set of\nholographic reflection interferograms (fig. 48a, b, c)\nshows the progression and growth of a stress corrosion induced crack in titanium alloy submerged in\nanhydrous methanol over a period of 14 hours.\nInitially this crack was not detectable visually (fig.\n48a)(ref. 153).\nThe holographic interferogram in figure 49 shows\na radial crack 3/16 in. long (at 12:00 o\'clock)\ndeliberately made by a coping saw. A much finer\n\nFIGURE 47.-Holographic fringe control.\n\n534-778 O-74\xe2\x80\x945\n\n57\n\nFIGURE 48.-Stress corrosion crack holography.\n\n58\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n50b) shows that the center part of the speaker is\ncontributing to the brightest fringe.\nModulated reference beam holography permits\nlarge amplitude vibrations to be faithfully mapped as\nfringe contours, and can equally well map extremely\nsmall amplitudes down to the order of 1/100 of a\nwavelength of light. The reference beam modulation\nis shifted only by the exciting frequency for this\npurpose. Modifications of this technique may also be\nused for reconstruction of ultrasonic beams, optimization of reference to object wave intensity ratios,\nfringe synthesis, frequency and phase modulation of\nobject waves, shutter modulation of both object and\nreference waves, and periodic modulation of both\nobject and reference waves, either at the same\nfrequencies or at frequencies with periods that are\nrationally or irrationally related to each other (ref.\n154).\nSummary\n\nFIGURE 48.-Stress corrosion crack holography-concluded.\n\nAleksoff found that if the reference beam is shifted in\nfrequency by an amount equal to the mechanical\nexciting frequency of the subject, or by its nth\nharmonic, then the shapes of the time-averaged\ncontrast contour curves (fig. 35) can be dramatically\nadjusted. The implementation and extrapolations of\nthis technique are far-reaching; in fact, its ramifications have already affected such areas as acoustic\nholography and holographic data processing, as well\nas holographic interferometry.\nThe change in the shape of these contrast curves\nhas practical value. One application is illustrated for\ntime-averaged vibrations of a speaker cone (fig. 50).\nThese photographs show the differences between\nnormal time-averaged holography (no frequency shift\nof the reference wave) and 75th order reference beam\nmodulation holography (frequency shift of reference\nwave in an amount equal to 75 times the subject\nvibrational frequency). A normal time-averaged hologram of a speaker being driven very hard makes it\nimpossible to determine what order of fringe the\ncenter part of the speaker is generating (fig. 50a).\nHowever, the second hologram of the same speaker\nvibration, using reference beam modulation, (fig.\n\nThe types of holography discussed above have\nbegun to move the science of optical interferometry\nout of the laboratory and into the test facility, the\nfield test site, and occasionally even the production\nline. Yet holography has done more, for while\ninterferometry can measure displacements to fractions of a wavelength, evaluation of just what\nmeasurement was being made and where it was being\nmeasured has been a major problem.\nInterferometric measurements are notoriously delicate and unstable, but holography has changed this.\nNow, superimposed upon the photograph of an\nobject being examined, an engineer or scientist may\nhave a recorded contour of interferometric changes\nthat are the result of known conditions at the time\nthe hologram exposures were made. Since the fringes\nof the double or time-averaged hologram are essentially differential, imperfections in any part of the\nsystem that do not change are eliminated. These\ninclude imperfections that have been problem areas\xe2\x80\x94\nthe roughness of the glass walls of a test chamber, the\nrelatively crude quality of auxiliary optics, film\nemulsion irregularities, etc.\nThese considerations make interferometric holography seem like the layman\'s interferometer. Unfortunately current practice of this technique is not\nwithout its limitations.\nAny component of a holographic system, be it a\nloose optical element, a vibrating plate holder, or any\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY\n\n59\n\nFIGURE 49.-Holographic crack detection.\n\nFIGURE 50.-Reference beam modulation holography of speaker cone.\n\nmovement of the object to be inspected, contributes\nits bit to the differential hologram. Its effect must\ntherefore be correctly compensated for, or false\nconclusions will be made about the subject and its\n\nflaws and defects. Second, the sensitivity of the\nprocess to displacement is inflexible and cannot be\nadjusted. This can result in any of the following\nconditions:\n\n60\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\nOnly very small stress and resultant strains can\nbe recorded.\nAnomalies are displayed that may be insignificant influence on practical performance and\ndesign.\nThe wave disturbances caused by the stress\ninteractions are not great enough to examine\nthin samples.\n\nThird, only flaws, defects, or changes that are\ncontained within material transmissive to the object\nbeam can be seen and measured. This and the other\ntwo characteristics contribute to the fourth and\ngreatest problem: correct interpretation of the re-\n\nsults. The final report depends on knowledgeable\ninterpretations, and these in turn depend on the\ninterpreter\'s ability.\nThe engineer most familiar with a test component,\nprocess, or method may be the best qualified to start\nholographic interferometric experimentation, after\nsome orientation and training in holography. He must\ninvestigate ways to keep unwanted vibrations to a\nminimum, the best geometry, and the type of\nexposure (interval and length) to use; he must also\ndetermine what exciting forces and frequencies or\nstresses to use on the subject. Under these conditions\nholographic interferometry can be of value in many\napplications.\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nMotion Picture and Television Holography\nThe type of holography that people will observe\nmost directly is the eventual use of three-dimensional\nimages for entertainment and education. Such images\nmay someday be formed in a theater or possibly\ntransmitted by microwave or telephone lines onto\ntelevision and projection screens in homes and offices. These applications on a mass scale are still in the\nfuture, although small-audience holographic motion\npictures now appear feasible. A less dramatic but\nsignificant use of holographic three-dimensional motion pictures will be as an aid in research and\ndevelopment. Motion pictures of the holographic\ninteraction fringes caused by tiny displacements of a\nmoving subject will also be discussed in this chapter.\nSince viewing a hologram is like observing a scene\nthrough a window, the larger the hologram or\n"window," the greater the number of observers who\ncan simultaneously view it. Motion picture holography for public viewing has been limited because of\nthis inherent drawback: Hologram film is very small.\nScientists and optical engineers speak of this problem\nas a need to reduce the information content required\non the hologram and yet be able to reconstruct an\nimage of acceptable quality. This reduction is also\nnecessary to make three-dimensional television picture transmission practical.\n\nBrumm and Haines discovered that if ground glass\nwas used for the dispersion medium (scattering plate)\n(fig. 51) the image became excessively "noisy" as\nhologram size was reduced, although image resolution\nremained relatively constant. A special type of\ndiffraction mask was then developed as a scattering\nplate. The mask produced a fairly noiseless reconstructed image whose resolution decreased as the size\nof the hologram was reduced (fig. 52). This discovery\nbecame the basis of a very primitive system for\nprojecting true holographic motion pictures. The\napparatus (fig. 53) recorded image frames on specially\nprepared flat plates (ref. 155 and 156).\nBuilding on this early advance by the University of\nMichigan, a number of other developers are now\nexperimenting with motion picture holography.\nJacobson and his associates at Hughes Aircraft Corporation have independently recorded and projected\nholographic motion pictures of fish swimming in a\ntank. Back lighting was used to display the developed\nfilm, so that the viewer could see the real image. The\nresults were quite good and showed the fish swimming in space.\nThe only difficulty encountered was a jitter\nproblem due to inadequate synchronization between\nthe rotating shutter and the camera film advance. In a\nnumber of frames, the film was moving while\n\nNASA RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nReducing the information content of holograms\nwas one of the first problems investigated by University of Michigan researchers under a NASA grant.\nThis study led to the development of one of the\nearliest motion picture hologram systems. The researchers first verified that a dispersion method\nyielded the best tradeoffs between the information\ncontent, perspective field-of-view, reconstructed\nimage resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio of the\nreconstructed image.\n\nHOLOGRAM\nPLATE\n^ EFFECTIVE\n\xe2\x80\x94 VIEWING\n-I\xe2\x80\x94ANGLE_\n\n_\n\nFIGURE 5 1 .\xe2\x80\x94Construction of a hologram through a dispersion plane.\n61\n\n62\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nFIGURE 53.-Scanning disc assembly for producing\nanimated hologram movies.\n\nFIGURE 52.-Imaging through a resolution reducing\ndispersion medium.\n\nexposure was in process. This problem can be\nresolved by improving the synchronization between\nthe shutter and film advance mechanism or by using\nFourier transform hologram frames much less sensitive to film motion (ch. 3, app. B).\nAs a result of this experiment, Hughes researchers\nthink that the most promising applications of this\ntechnique will be found in picture holomicroscopy,\ntime-resolved holographic mterferometry, and timeresolved particle dynamics studies (ref. 157).\nMotion pictures of holographic images have been\ntaken or proposed for several NASA applications.\nHigh speed motion pictures have been made of the\ntransient responses of a vibrating beam, cylinder, and\ndisk, and the responses were correlated with mechanical theory and calculated displacements. These experimental results have not yet been applied to\npractical problems (refs. 111 and 113).\nFigure 54 shows the fringe patterns generated by\nthe transient motion of the cylinder after it was\nstruck by a ballistic pendulum. The frames show both\nthe real-time fringes produced by the transient\nmotion and its eventual decay with time. This series\nwas photographed at 5000 frames per second.\nFrame 1 in the figure is the fringe pattern seen\nbefore the shock. This complex fringe system before\n\n63\n\nMOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION HOLOGRAPHY\n\nFrame 1\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\nFIGURE 54.-Real-time holographic interferometric fringe system of\n18-inch-diameter cyclinder photographed by high-speed camera\n(5000 pictures per second) after shock event (frame 2).\n\n20\n\n64\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nshock was caused by the object\'s holographically\nnoticeable contraction and expansion with very small\ntemperature changes. The problem was so acute that\neven opening of the door of the laboratory caused a\nnoticeable fringe shift; later tests with the transient\nresponse of the disk were hindered even by vibration\nof the hologram plate caused by camera noise.\nDifficulties encountered in these experiments can\nbe overcome in the future by maintaining closer\ntemperature control of the working area, isolating the\nholographic system from the operator and from heat\ngenerating instruments, reducing noise vibrations of\nthe camera, and greatly increasing the sampling rate.\nIt seems possible that quantitative analysis of the\nfringe movements corresponding to transient responses of cylinders, disks, and plates can thus be\naccomplished (ref. 119).\nA promising new technique developed by R. Kurtz\nof MSFC for making real-time three-dimensional\nmotion pictures is based on the concept of taking\nsimultaneous back and front light holograms of\nrapidly moving objects in an ellipsoidal configuration\n(ch. 3). This concept may be implemented in several\ndifferent ways (one is shown in fig. 55); all are\ncovered by patent applications. Not only can sequential holograms of a high speed object be recorded, but\nas many as 10 separate holograms can be recorded on\nthe same small area of film (ref. 158). According to\nKurtz, the potential usefulness of real-time motion\npicture holography is virtually unlimited. He believes\nit may provide a dramatic increase of usefulness over\nregular stationary holography, just as the twodimensional motion picture was a great advance over\nstill photography.\nUtilizing one of the patented methods mentioned\nabove, R. Kurtz and L. Perry of MSFC\'s Space\nSciences Lab recently provided the first demonstration of a true three-dimensional motion picture\ncamera with front surface resolution of detail from a\nmoving object. A 100-ft roll of 70-mm film was\nsuccessfully used to record the constant motion of a\nmoving target in real time with a cw laser and the\nimage reconstructed resolution of front surface detail.\nKurtz plans to use holographic real-time motion\npictures to monitor the thin film particulate and\ncontamination buildup on optics elements and components in space (ch. 6). Other non-NASA researchers\nhave also been pursuing means of recording holographic motion pictures or sequences of holograms of\nextremely rapid events. Carpluk at the University of\n\nCalifornia is working on a stereo laser framing\ncamera. The Institut Franco-Allemand de Recherches\nis investigating holography of moving phase objects,\nand A. N. Zaidel of the Soviet Union has obtained a\nsequence of holographic frames only 40 nanoseconds\napart (refs. 159 through 161).\nCOMMERCIAL ENDEAVORS\n\nD. Gabor is pursuing the development of commercially oriented, three-dimensional holographic films\nthat can be projected in a theater and do not require\nthe viewer to wear special glasses. The system uses a\nspecial screen assembled with segmented lenticularlike surfaces of a photosensitive material mounted in\na hollow curve called a "holographic mirror" that\nreflects to all parts of the theater. Two lasers project\nseparate holographic pictures for each eye. The screen\nreflects the images in interleaved vertical zones, each\nthe width of normal eye spacing and these dual\nimages are combined instinctively by the eye to\nproduce the stereoscopic effect.\nThe Gabor technique significantly increases the\nversatility of holographic filming, because the film\ncan be made with a conventional stereoscopic camera\nusing conventional lighting rather than the lasers\nusually required for holograms. Lasers are used only\nto project the stereoimages onto the holographic\nmirror. Although Gabor\'s investigations do not yet\nhave the large-scale financial backing required for\nactual commercial development, a German corporation has shown interest in acquiring rights to produce\nfilms using his patented method (refs. 162 through\n165).\nSome interest has also been shown in commercial\nfilming of laser-illuminated holographic motion pictures. Joseph Strick, a motion picture producer, has\nannounced his intention of making a holographic\nmovie based on a patented method. Budgeting for the\nfilm has been set at $1 million, with an additional\n$400 000 for equipment. All filming will be done in\nstudios using laser lighting.\nNorth American Philips Laboratory has been\nexperimenting with bandwidth reduction and holographic films and has announced establishment of a\nholographic movie "studio." TRW has also been\nmaking sequential holograms of various scientific\nphenomena (refs. 165 through 167).\nAt present, holographic television does not appear\nfeasible due to the large transmission bandwidth\n\nMOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION HOLOGRAPHY\n\n65\n\n-13\n\n34\n\nUl\n\no\ncc\n\nD\nO\n\n\'17\n\nen\n\nFIGURE 55.-Cine-holography of high-velocity objects.\n\nrequirement. In a recent article, Gabor, et al., pointed\nout that 90 billion dots of information would be\nrequired to transmit a single holographic TV picture\nframe. This is based on a resolution requirement of\n1500 fringes/mm and an 8-in. square picture. A\ntelevision frame in the United States presently carries\nonly 250 000 dots of information. Some of the\nprogress in reducing bandwidth and information\ncontent required in holographic movies, however, can\nbe expected to have a direct impact on holographic\n\ntelevision. For example the scatter plate technique\ndeveloped by Brumm and Raines at the University of\nMichigan and the horizontal strip technique of\nDeBitello both reduce bandwidth requirements; and\nBell Telephone Laboratories have been investigating\nthe transmission of holograms using narrowband\nvideo signals. All these projects have so far been\nexperimental, but holographic picture phone communication may be a possibility (refs. 164 and 168\nthrough 171).\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nNonoptical Holography\nAlthough nonoptical holography has lagged somewhat behind the development of optical holography,\ninterest and research are increasing in this area. Few\nmaterials are transparent to light, but almost all are\npartially or fully transparent to microwaves, acoustic\nwaves, or seismic waves. Thus while optical holography is best suited for studying surfaces, nonoptical\nholography is valuable in probing the interior of\nsubstances, equipment, or living matter. Nevertheless,\nas previous chapters have shown, holographic study\nof even the surfaces of thin objects can reveal a\nsurprising amount of information about defects,\nimperfections, or failures in their interiors. Testing\nand measurement by nonoptical holography supplement rather than replace optical holography.\nNonoptical holograms are formed on the same\nbasis as optical holograms. They also require an\nobject, an object beam illuminator or transducer, a\nreference beam illuminator or transducer, and a\nsensitive recording layer or array of point detectors to\nact as the hologram. Because most nonoptical detectors can directly record both the amplitude and phase\nof the object wave, the reference beam and its\nilluminator can sometimes be eliminated.\nAcoustic holography requires the object and\nsource transducers to be immersed in a tank of water\nas the best and most convenient transmitting medium. In conventional acoustic holography, the detector array is often replaced by the water surface of the\ntest tank. However, working with these waves generally requires specialized, bulky, and expensive equipment, which is one reason for the slow development\nof this kind of holography. Nonoptical techniques\nalso require specialized experience; interpretation of\ndistorted holograms formed by passage of Waves\nthrough the transmissive object is a complex task.\nThe synthetic aperture, sidelooking radar (a form\nof microwave holographic radar) and the acoustooptical holographic image system are the only items\n\nsufficiently developed to have commercial importance. Others are still in the research and development stage, and are not yet ready for practical\napplication. Synthetic aperture radar has been used\nextensively for several years in military surveillance\nand mapping and now is being applied to earth resource surveillance and management. Acoustic holography has recently emerged in the industrial world\nand appears ideally suited for inspecting and testing\nthe interiors of all sorts of materials, equipment, and\norganisms; new uses are continually being found in\nmedicine and manufacturing.\nApplication of holographic techniques to seismology is at the early exploratory stage. The principles\nand characteristics are similar to those of acoustical\nholography extended to the very low frequency\nregions, but with some key differences. The long\nseismic wavelengths require large recording areas, and\nthe seismic "synthetic aperture" method seems to be\nthe best approach for recording the wavefront.\nA number of different sources have been used for\nseismically illuminating the area to be studied. Mechanical vibrators, impulses, and even an explosive\ncharge have been used. With the explosive charge,\nonly components of a single frequency were used in\nconstructing the hologram.\nAgain, the formidable part of seismic holography\nis the interpretation of results. Inhomogeneities of\nthe earth as well as the structural inhomogeneities of\nindividual formations themselves distort the seismic\nand sound waves in a very complex fashion. The\nresulting holograms appear meaningless under normal\ninspection. In this area, however, as was the case with\npulse-echo seismic mapping, progress in data processing will make it possible to extract valuable information from the holograms. Once available, seismic\nholography may be a valuable tool for oil and mineral\nexploration, subterranean water detection, local fault\ndetection, and geological exploration (ref. 172).\n67\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FIL\n\n68\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\nNASA RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nSome of the nonoptical holographic research\nefforts of NASA have concerned the following areas:\nNondestructive testing and defect detection by\nmicrowave holography\nMicrowave holographic contour generation\nRecording of microwave holograms\nTemporal reference acoustical holography\nDirect acousto-optical wavefront reconstruction\nElectronic sound holograms\nTwo developments that show considerable promise\nare nondestructive testing and inspection using microwaves, and generation of terrain relief and contour\nmaps using a special type of holographic microwave\nsystem. NASA is vigorously supporting development\nwork on both of these systems, but several problems\nmust be solved before they can have commercial\nvalue. For example certain image aberrations now\npresent in terrain relief and contour mapping need to\nbe reduced so that better maps can be made at higher\naltitudes. Plans have been made to use dual microwave frequencies to map out ranging terrain contours\nautomatically. A study is also in progress on possible\ndirect recording of microwaves on film, which would\ngreatly simplify the recording of microwave holograms.\nThe usefulness of microwave holography in producing and processing radar signals is established, but\nfew applications for microwaves in nondestructive\ntesting have yet been devised. The resolution of the\ncurrent microwave defect inspection system needs to\nbe increased and the scan modified to give full\nthree-dimensional images instead of two-dimensional\ncross-section views.\n\nminimum ranges down to inches or less. It was\ndeveloped by Electro-Physics under a NASA contract.\nThe basic method of operation is to sweep the\nfrequency of the transmitter probe, so that at any\nscan position the frequency returned indicates the\nrange at which that signal was reflected back. There is\nan apparatus for two-dimensional scan in depth and\nalong a horizontal axis (fig. 56a). Figure 56b shows\nthe concept for reconstruction. The resulting hologram is in the horizontal direction only (representing\ndepth) and is a recording of,the frequency domain\ninterferometer (FDI) signal.\nThe results of these experiments are encouraging,\nand the developer believes they indicate the feasibility of a sidelooking radar based on the FDI principle\nfor nondestructive testing and possibly ultrasonic\ninspection (ref. 173). Production of full three-dimensional images requires further development (refs. 173\nand 174).\nMicrowave Holographic Contour Generation\n\nFor MSC, the University of Michigan\'s Institute of\nScience and Technology is planning to investigate use\nof holographic techniques to map terrain contours\nfrom an aircraft. Mapping of this type could be\n\nDefect simulator\n\nX\n\nZ\n\neep\nn.\n\n(ext SYNC)\n\nCRO\n\nRecording B \xe2\x80\x94Scan hologram with FDI\n\nDefect Detection by Microwave Holography\n\nA microwave holographic system is being developed for JPL to allow inspection of a solid propellant\nmotor. The three techniques tested to date are based\non conventional types of radar dimensional scans.\nOne of the scans (the "A" scan) was one-dimensional\nin depth only; another was two-dimensional in depth\nand along the horizontal at a given height. The "A"\nscan tested optical processing of a new type of radar\nknown as a "frequency domain interferometer"\n(FDI) suitable for depth resolution at very short\n\nHologram\n\nSpherical lens\n\nReal reduced image \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCylinder lens\n\nReconstructing B-Scan image\n\nFIGURE 5 6.-Frequency domain holographic interferometry.\n\nNONOPTICAL HOLOGRAPHY\nreadily correlated with infrared and other optical\nmapping techniques, because the holographic technique works best from directly below the aircraft out\nto an angle of about 45 degrees from the nadir, the\nsame angles of coverage over which optical scanners\nwork best. Sidelooking radars map better at coverage\nangles from about 20 to 75 degrees. Contours are\nformed in the range dimension in the same way as\noptical contours are made (ch. 6).\nEqually good resolution in the cross-track direction is obtained with conventional phase array radar,\nalso a form of microwave holography. Dr. R. W.\nLarson of the University of Michigan has built a\nfeasibility model of a contouring radar that produced\nmappings with 20-ft ranging contours in the flight\npath direction using the holographic technique.\nPhased array techniques were required to achieve a\n20-ft matching cross path resolution. It was limited in\npower to a maximum altitude of 1000 ft and\nmaximum slant angle of 45 degrees, giving a 2000 ft\nby 2000 ft coverage pattern.\nThe top of figure 57 shows a picture taken by this\nradar model of terrain whose contour is shown at the\nbottom. Note that at far ranges and large slant angles\nfrom the nadir the range contours naturally tend to\nbe compressed, making interpretation difficult. This\nproblem will be investigated further under NASA\ncontract (ref. 175).\nRecording of Microwave Holograms\n\nOne of the difficulties in microwave holography,\nas in all forms of nonoptical holography, lies in\nrecording the wavefront. The usual procedure has\nbeen to use horn antennas to mechanically scan the\n\n69\n\nelectromagnetic field. The recorded field is then\nelectronically processed and displayed on a cathode\nray tube (CRT) device, which is photographed to\nestablish a permanent record. This procedure is also\nused with acoustic holography.\nUnder a NASA grant, research at Harvard University has produced interesting results in direct microwave recording. Polaroid film is exposed to an\nelectromagnetic field which generates a thermal image\nthat causes the film to develop selectively. A crude\nmicrowave hologram can thus be made directly, just\nby exposing the film to the field to be recorded. K.\nlizuka has expanded this research using an illuminating microwave field in an interferometric setup (refs.\n176 through 178).\nAcoustic Holography\n\nHolograms in the acoustic wave range of 30 kHz to\n10 GHz can be useful for a variety of purposes, from\noceanography at the low end of the spectrum to\nultrasonic microscopy at the high end. Within the\nmid-range lie the promising applications of nondestructive testing and medical diagnosis. For some time\nNASA has been investigating methods of reconstructing the acoustic image directly from acousto-optical\ninteraction, without the need to form an acoustic\nhologram. Hopefully such techniques will eliminate\naberrations, increase sensitivity, and speed up the\nreconstruction process.\nConsiderable experimental work is continuing on\nthe use of acoustic energy to form holograms in\nhighly sensitive areas and organs of the body; these\ntechniques could greatly improve medical diagnosis\nand treatment. Possibilities also exist for inspecting\n\nFIGURE 57.-Range contour microwave hologram.\n\n70\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nperishable foods with either acoustical waves or\nmicrowaves.\nTemporal Reference Acoustic Holography\n\nMcDonnell-Douglas studied the application of\nacoustical holography to medical diagnosis for pRC.\nThe objective was to find a noninvasive threedimensional recording method for visualizing soft\ntissue structures without harmful radiation.\nThe investigators first reviewed the nonholographic pulse-echo imaging techniques presently in\nwide clinical use. Although they provide valuable\ninformation, image quality is poor and repeatability is\nlow; these problems caused Queen\'s University to\nabandon the technique in brain tumor research. As a\nresult, McDonnell-Douglas investigated two approaches to "temporal reference acoustical holography."\nOne approach involved the direct recording of an\nacoustic wavefront, as shown in figure 58. Since the\nwavefront amplitude and phase are instantaneously\ncaptured, no reference beam is required as in conventional liquid-surface holography. A "Sokolov ultrasound camera" is used to record the wavefront. The\nresults of this experiment were not as good as\nanticipated, however, because of imperfections in the\nsetup and the interaction characteristics of the\nultrasound camera.\nMcDonnell-Douglas\' second detection and recording scheme is a new form of surface layer acoustic\nholography (fig. 59). Instead of making a hologram of\nthe steady-state standing wave generated on the\nsurface, as in commercial units, the system makes a\ndifferential double-exposure interference hologram of\nthe surface at two separate controlled times. The\ninterval and spacing between the two exposures is\ntimed so that the second exposure is made half an\nacoustic cycle after the first (hence, "temporal\nreference" holography). Results with this system have\nbeen favorable (ref. 179).\nDirect Acousto-Optical Wavefront Reconstruction\n\nJPL has been supporting TRW in researching\nmethods to reconstruct the optical image directly\nfrom acoustic waves transmitted through various\ntypes of object specimens. This would eliminate the\nneed to form an acoustic hologram and would\nsimplify the subsequent problem of recording and\n\nPIEZOELECTRIC\nSOUND SOURCE\n\nr\\\n\nCAMERA\n\nFIGURE 58.-Ultrasonic camera system producing the nontime-averaged temporal reference holograms.\n\nEXCITED SURFACE\n\nPROPAGATING MEDIA\nACOUSTIC SOURCE\n\nFIGURE 59.-Schematic of double pulse holography system\nto record temporal reference holograms.\n\nlater reading it out for final reconstruction. Current\nuse of the surface interaction wave solves part of this\nproblem, since the surface itself is the acoustic\nhologram, but TRW has carried this principle further.\nRecent TRW work is based on the Bragg diffraction method used extensively for acousto-optical laser\nbeam deflection (ch. 9) where the sound wave\nfunctions as a diffraction grating to the laser beam\n(ref. 180). This method has been used for nondestructive testing of solid propellant, elastomeric materials\nsuch as neoprene, which highly attenuate frequencies\nin the 100-MHz region (refs. 180 and 181).\nElectronic Sound Hologram\n\nSimilar efforts have been planned at LRC. An\nacoustic holographic facility will be used to locate\n\n71\n\nNONOPTICAL HOLOGRAPHY\nand measure flaws, fatigue induced cracks, bonds in\ncomposites, etc. (ref. 182). The equipment at this\nfacility will be designed so that "one could inspect\nthe interior of an object without going through the\nintermediate step of developing a hologram. Such a\nscheme would permit a real-time inspection of internal flaws in much the same manner as with the use of\nacousto-optical holographic techniques. A possible\nimplementation of this setup might be an "electronic\nsound hologram."\nOther research is being carried out in direct\nreconstruction of acoustic holograms that may allow\ncoherent acoustic processing very similar to optical\ndata processing (ch. 9). It may also be possible to\nimplement an acoustic interferometric inspection\nsystem that compares, for example, production samples with an established standard in real time (refs.\n180, 183, and 184).\n\n\\\n\nSYNTHETIC\nAPERTURE. I\n\n, HORN SCAN\n\n.J\n\nSLR SCANNING\n\nSLR HOLOGRAM\n\nCOMMERCIAL ENDEAVORS\nMicrowave Holographic Radar\n\nIn a sense, the first practical and commercial\napplication of microwave holography was the\n"synthetic aperture" sidelooking radar. Microwave\nholography has benefited from the development of\nradar systems although they, of course, evolved quite\nindependently of holographic considerations and\nwere developed along information theory lines. However, hindsight shows not only that these systems can\nbe considered holographic in nature, but also that\nconsiderable new insight, is obtained when they are\nviewed as holographic processes.\nFour common types of radar systems can be\nanalyzed on the basis of holography:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Synthetic aperture radar\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Chirp radar\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rotating-target imaging\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Phased-array beam forming\nRecording azimuth information on a synthetic\naperture, sidelooking radar is a one-dimensional holographic process. Instead of recording the energy from\na radiating point on a giant holographic plate held up\nin the sky, the recording detector (receiver on the\naircraft) is scanned across the sky while the same\npoint is being illuminated by the broad azimuth beam\nof the antenna. This is illustrated in figure 60. The\ntop portion shows reflected radiation from only two\npoints at different ranges and azimuths. The two\n\nSLR IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION\n\nFIGURE 60.-Sidelooking radar holographic principle.\n\npoints are sorted out in range by pulse time while\nthey spread their radiation out in the azimuthal\ndirection and the receiver scans over the length\ninterval I. The laser beam reconstruction process\nshown at the bottom of the figure integrates the\nazimuthal data, over the interval I, for each point\nback into the correctly focused positions (refs. 174\nand 185).\nHolographic Microwave Gun Detection\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania\'s Moore School of\nElectrical Engineering has been working on a microwave holographic system for gun detection. Since\nonly phase information is used, the final recorded\nimage is termed a "phasigram" rather than a hologram (which normally would also contain amplitude\ninformation).\nThe image recording is made by using a Polaroid\ncamera to photograph the face of a CRT display. The\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n72\n\nimage is then reconstructed using a helium-neon laser.\nAs presently configured, the system requires about 10\nminutes to identify an object. For an antihijacking\napplication, this is unacceptable, but work is progressing toward a real-time detection system (ref. 186).\nAcousto-Optical Holographic Imager\n\nA commercial acousto-optical imager now being\nmarketed is based on conventional acoustical holographic techniques. This system provides previously\nunavailable evaluation criteria for such applications as\nrolled steel plate delaminations, nonbonds in aluminum honeycomb panel, high pressure diffusion bonds\nin lead-titanium, deteriorations of steel spot welds,\nfiber composite spatter-patterns, porous areas of steel\ncastings, tubular outlines of the radial artery in the\nforearm, and the image of tendons in the thumb and\nindex finger. Similar uses are possible for examining\nthree-dimensional interiors of all types of plastic,\nmetal, composites, or living tissues.\nA typical concept model is shown in figure 61, in\nwhich the standing wave surface layer of water is used\n\nas the equivalent of an acoustic hologram. It is "read\noff and reconstructed by an optical system as in\nconventional optical holography. This arrangement is\ncalled surface layer or liquid-surface holography (ref.\n187). The degree of penetration of the object wave is\ngoverned by the acoustic impedance match between\nthe fluid in the tank and the object\'s material\ncomposition as well as the absorption and scatter of\nsound waves within the object. Acoustic frequency\ntuning is therefore important in the application of\nthese techniques, since lower frequencies will allow\ndeeper penetration at the expense of degraded resolution and depth of field (ref. 188 and 189).\nThe medical application of liquid surface acoustic\nholography is being extensively studied at many\nmedical centers, particularly cancer referral institutions. Roswell Park Memorial Institute and a Houston\nmedical center are using this approach for breast\ncancer detection, and the University of Cincinnati is\nusing it to map the vascular circulatory system of the\nneck. Queen\'s University employs a scanning unit for\nbrain tumor detection, and the Battelle Northwest\nLaboratory has been studying a variety of applica-\n\nLASER\nBEAM\n\nI\n\nRECONSTRUCTED\nIMAGE\n\nFIGURE 61.-Holographic system, generating a focused image hologram\nat the liquid surface.\n\nNONOPTICAL HOLOGRAPHY\ntions, including human fetus examination to determine sex (refs. 190 through 192).\nAcoustic holography provides good images not\nonly of soft tissue but also of hard solids like metal\nblocks. This makes it a valuable tool in nondestructive testing or nondestructive evaluation. In evaluation, the penetrative ability of acoustic techniques\npermits total cross-sectional examination for flaws.\nFor example, steel blocks as much as 19 in. thick\nhave been completely examined (refs. 193 and 194).\nThe major implementation to date in nondestructive\nteaching has been liquid-surface holography, since\nreal-time display can best be achieved this way.\nAcoustical holography does have certain current\nlimitations. Recording is the primary problem\xe2\x80\x94more\nso than for optical holograms because suitable recording materials do not yet exist. As a result, techniques\nhave been developed to convert the acoustical hologram to an optical one. Another problem is loss of\nthe three-dimensional appearance of the hologram\nduring laser reconstruction. This has been circumvented by use of a computer technique called\nrange-gating, in which a three-dimensional image is\nconstructed from examination of many different\nrange planes in the hologram (ref. 172).\n\nUnderwater Acoustic Holographic Viewing System\n\nThe U.S. Navy is sponsoring development of a\nreal-time underwater viewing system for several uses,\nincluding their deep submergence vehicle program.\nTypical performance goals for such a system are\nranges between 2 meters and 100 meters and a field\nof view of about 40 degrees with an angular resolution of about 0.4 degree. Major components of the\nsystem are an ultrasonic transmitter, an array of\nreceiving transducers, the signal processing electronics, a TV display, and a real-time holographic image\nreconstructor.\nThe system transmits a pulse of acoustic energy\nfrom a transmitter array. At a specific time corresponding to a desired range, an acoustic receiver array\nis gated "on" to directly record the amplitude and\nphase of the signal reflected from underwater objects.\nBoth the receiver and transmitter arrays are synchronously scanned, and the signals from each element\ndrive a cathode ray tube displaying the resultant\n\n534-778 O-74\xe2\x80\x946\n\n73\n\nhologram. Real-time display of the reconstructed\nimage is possible by the use of a holographic display\ntube (refs. 195 and 196).\n\nReal- Time Holographic Display Tube\n\nG. Goetz and others have developed a real-time\ndisplay tube primarily for nonoptical holograms. The\ndevice consists of an electro-optical crystal, an off-axis\nscanning electron gun, and associated optics and\nelectronics.\nThe scanning electron beam intensity is modulated\nwith the information from the hologram to be\ndisplayed. Any hologram that can be transformed\ninto an electronic raster signal can be reconstructed.\nThe hologram is written on the crystal face in the\nform of an electric charge pattern, and when coherent\nlight is passed through the crystal, this electric charge\npolarizes the light in varying amounts proportional to\nthe original hologram pattern (Pochels\' effect, ref.\n190). This polarized light can easily be converted into\nan amplitude modulated pattern of coherent light by\na set of crossed polarizers. This beam of coherent\nlight amplitude modulated in perfect match to the\noriginal hologram reconstructs a virtual or real image.\nThis device appears to have the potential of reconstructing both acoustic and microwave images, and\nseems competitive with pure digital computer reconstruction of these types of holograms (refs. 196, 197,\nand 172).\nAcoustic Holographic Microscopy\n\nThe prime advantage of holographic microscopy at\nacoustic frequencies lies in the penetrating capability\nof acoustical systems. Practically speaking, it means\nthat in biological work, differences in the mechanical\nproperties of the specimen can be utilized to obtain\nhigh contrast imagery.\nAn acoustic microscope has been constructed\nusing a laser that scans the acoustically illuminated\nsurface. In tests to date, an individual cell of an\nonionskin, displayed on a TV screen, showed detail in\nthe order of 0.001 in. Another approach in the\nmicroscopy area uses the Bragg diffraction effect for\nimaging. Both methods display comparable resolutions (refs. 198 and 199).\n\nPage Intentionally Left Blank\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nHolographic Data Storage, Processing and Retrieval\nThe eventual use of holography for extensive data\nstorage and retrieval appears inevitable. It promises\nreliability, incredibly dense storage capacity, and very\nfast readout time. Once data has been converted into\na form lending itself to holographic data storage, it is\na relatively simple task to process it optically, since\nthe same types of input and output transducers are\nrequired. Optical processing can also offer enormous\nincreases in processing speeds because of its inherent\nability to operate in parallel rather than in sequence.\nMany types of operations and functions can be\nperformed by optical processing, using complex\namplitude and phase filters or inputs (hologram filters\nand films). Holographic films can store up to 106 bits\nof information per square millimeter, and these bits\ncan be simultaneously manipulated in the processor\nin the time it takes to traverse the optical system (less\nthan 10"8 sec). At least 1014 bits per second can be\npotentially processed for a 1 millimeter square input;\nthe fastest current digital computer is six to seven\norders of magnitude slower.\nModern technology, bureaucracy, and the space\nprogram are generating an ever-increasing volume of\ndata, and conventional data storage techniques are\napproaching their limits. Packing densities and access\ntimes of magnetic cores, tapes, and discs are no longer\nadequate; 1010- to 1012-bit memories with access\ntimes on the order of a few nanoseconds will soon be\nneeded. Similarly the profusion of printed material is\nstraining the storage capabilities of libraries even with\nmicrofilm storage and retrieval systems. For all these\nreasons holographic storage is of increasing interest.\nIts best features are high-density storage and great\nredundancy as insurance against loss or damage of\ndata.\nMany data manipulation functions can already be\nperformed more quickly and efficiently by optical\nprocessors utilizing holographic techniques, and these\nwill continue to be refined. Their major potential\n\nspeed advantages over digital computer processing\nstem from multiple channel capability. Indeed, each\nresolution element of the input and output plane can\nbe considered as a separate computer channel,\nworking with the speed of light simultaneously with\nall its sister resolution elements.\nNASA RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nNASA has been in the forefront of optical and\nholographic data storage and data processing investigations since 1965, through both in-house and contractor programs. Development of a high-density,\ncompact, holographic memory for eventual space use\nis well under way at MSFC, while GSFC has\ndeveloped designs for space-based optical data processors that use holographic filters for some operations.\nSome NASA efforts in this aspect of holography are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Techniques to aid holographic data processing\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Holographic analysis of printed circuit boards\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Holographic image deblurring and resolution\nenhancement\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Coherent noise elimination\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Optical read/write holographic memory system\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Optical-to-optical input transducer\n\xe2\x80\xa2 On-board spacecraft optical data processing\nsystem\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Holographic spacecraft attitude determination\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Meteor trail processing\nTechniques to Aid Holographic Data Processing\n\nTwo groups at GSFC and one at MSFC have\nexplored problems in implementing the theory of\noptical data processing.* A. R. Shulman and G.\n*A. Shulman\'s NASA technical report and his more extensive\ntextbook, Optical Data Processing, are particularly rich\nsources on the subject.\n75\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FIL\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n76\n\nGrebowsky at GSFC have made valuable contributions in popularizing and interpreting holography for\nengineers and technicians, while J. Williams, R. Kurtz\nand P. Espy at MSFC are developing holographic\noptical processing techniques for nondestructive testing (refs. 200 through 202).\nThe Computer Technology Section at GSFC has\nexperimented with the results of coherent images\nmeasured or filtered in the Fourier transform or the\nspatial frequency plane of an optical processor. The\noutput can be obtained from this operation in two\nways: (1) The intensity in various parts of the Fourier\ntransform image plane can be directly measured and\n(2) Information can be read out after the spatially\nfiltered image is reconstructed in the output image\nplane.\n\nThe first approach led to development (under\ncontract) of a unique set of fine grain, specially\nshaped, wedge and ring mosaic detectors. Signals\nfrom these detectors should enable direct remote\nreadout of amplitude and angular orientation characteristics of an input image inserted or written into the\nprocessor. This will be valuable on board an Earth\nresources satellite or other surveillance platform.\nFigure 62 shows the signature differences generated from outputs of the angle and ring (radius)\ndetectors. These results are for two classes of clouds:\nsmall scattered clouds at the top left, and large clouds\nwith line structure at the top right.\nTo investigate the second approach, a set of\nelectrically alterable wedge and ring filters is under\ndevelopment for use in the Fourier transform plane\n\nURGE CLOUDS\nWITH LINE\nSTRUCTURE\n\n1.5\n\n\'SMALL\nSCATTERED\nCLOUDS^\'\n.A..1\n\nIT\n\nSMALL\nSCATTERED\nCLOUDS\n\nUJ\n\nI\nO\n\nQ.\n\n1.2.3,4.5.6.7.8.9.10,11.12,13,\n180\xc2\xb0\nSECTORS\n\nOUTPUT\nOF\nANGLE DETECTOR\n\nLARGE CLOUDS\nWITH LINE\nSTRUCTURE\n\n1.0\n\n.5\n\n\xe2\x80\xa21.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.\nRINGS\n\nOUTPUT\nOF\nRADIUS DETECTOR\n\nFIGURE 62.-Output of radius and angle Fourier detectors.\n\nR\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC DATA STORAGE, PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL\nto block out or select specific bands of frequencies\nand angular orientations. Remote implementation of\nthis approach appears more complex, since the\noutput image must be examined in coordination with\nmany combinations of filters. Scanning of the processed image seems to require as much information as\nscanning of the original. However, a system of this\ntype might prove valuable to someone who could\nexamine the output filtered image directly or extract\nenough data from a digital-only readout of the\nfiltered output matrix image.\nPlans have been made to synthesize both types of\nelements into a computer-controlled remote optical\ndata processing system (fig. 63). The computer\nprocesses detector signals sensed from the Fourier\ntransform plane and controls the filters. At the\noutput plane, a conventional mosaic detector reconstructs the image (refs. 203 and 204).\nHolographic Analysis of Printed Circuit Boards\n\nThe present Saturn Apollo vehicle was plagued by\n\n77\n\nfailures of its checkout control and telemetry systems\ncaused by cracking solder joints on the printed circuit\nboards. NASA and contractor studies identified the\nprime cause of these cracking failures from the strain\nproduced by thermal fluctuations to which the\nboards are subjected. Since space programs require\nzero defects, holography may help attain this goal.\nOne of the most imaginative applications of\nholographic data processing was the development by\nMSFC of a solder joint analyzer. Focused on a\nsuspect joint, it can predict accurately the joint\'s\nexpected performance if subjected to destructive\ntesting. Essentially it is an analog optical data\nprocessor that computes the degree of similarity\nbetween the joint in its original state and the same\njoint after heating and cooling. This comparison is\nmade not on the basis of image appearance but on the\nspatial frequencies contained in the images.\nThis method might be adapted to the testing of\nother types of electronic circuits and wiring boards in\nconjunction with thin film monitoring, so that layers\nof integrated circuits and microelectronic boards\n\nFOURIER PLANE SENSORS\n"OTTOOPTICAL-TO-OPTICAL CONVERTER\n(NON-COHERENT TO COHERENT)\n\nRECONSTRUCTED\nIMAGE PLANE\nSENSOR\n\n\\Jllllllllll7\n\nRECONSTRUCTED\nIMAGE PLANE\n\nFOURIER TRANSFORM\n.PLANE\n\nLENS\nMOVING\nMASKING\nMAGNIFYING\n\nSENSING\n\nFILTERING\n\nCOMPUTER\nCOMMANDS*\n\nTOUTPUT (DECISION)\n\nFIGURE 63.-Optical digital system with optical input.\n\nSENSING\n\n78\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\ncould be inspected as they are formed rather than\nafter completion. This could eliminate the expensive\nneed to deposit extra layers on top of already faulty\nlayers before testing.\nThis NASA-developed technique offers a method\nof measuring permanent deformation and fatigue\nelastic deformation in metals, plastics, composites,\nand other materials due to all types of stresses. It is\nalso ideally suited to measuring small, nearly planar\nobjects (refs. 205 and 206).\nThe correlation process can be best understood as\na reconstruction of a formerly exposed hologram\nexcept that instead of reconstructing the original\nobject wave, the reference wave is reconstructed by\nilluminating the hologram by the object wave (app.\nB). This property of a hologram illustrates the basic\nreciprocity between the object and reference waves\nthat forms a hologram, a "reconstruction process" as\nimplemented for the solder joint analyzer (app. D,\nrefs. 200, 207 and 208).\nHolographic Image Deblurring and Resolution\nEnhancement\n\nNASA has supported in part Dr. G. W. Stroke\'s\nproject of synthesizing and fabricating Fourier transform hologram filters. These filters were constructed\nto perform multiplication and division in the spatial\nfrequency plane. Spatial frequency multiplication\nallows correlation and pattern recognition, while\nspatial frequency division permits deblurring and\nimage restoration. Techniques were also developed to\nadd and subtract two or more images so that\nextraneous information can be selectively eliminated.\nR. Kurtz and P. Espy of MSFC have implemented\nmany of these operations in a laboratory environment\n(refs. 201, 206 and 207). Besides deblurring, these\nfiltering techniques may be applied to Earth resources\nand sky laboratory experimental data processing and\nextraction operations. Simultaneous recognition and\nlocation of several basic pattern shapes at once in a\ngiven image are also being studied to greatly increase\nthe speed at which pictures and images can be\nprocessed (refs. 131, 201, 209 and 210).\nAn x-ray photograph of the Sun was made by a\nlarge pinhole camera in a rocket (a focusing lens is\nimpractical for this application). The holographic\ndeblurring process sharpened the original image into a\nmore usable one. How the deblurring works is\nexplained in appendix D. Dr. Stroke and his staff\n\nhave been refining the fabrication and utilization of\nthese filters, but the practical problems involved in\nthese deblurring techniques are formidable. Very\nsubtle inhomogeneities of the film in either amplitude\nor phase transmission can destroy the filter operation.\nThe filters must be extremely linear over transmission\nranges of five to six orders of magnitude, and special\nmasking techniques are necessary to produce them\n(refs. 207, 210 and 211).\nCoherent Noise Elimination\n\nCoherent optical processing and filtering operations are becoming quite useful despite the problem\nof having system noise diffraction patterns formed in\nthe output image plane. Such patterns can be very\nannoying and troublesome. These "bullseye" patterns\n(fig. 64) are usually caused by dust or bubbles in or\non the lenses. They can be reduced by carefully\nselecting the lens for the unavoidable minimum of\nbubbles and defects and keeping lens surfaces extremely clean, but neither method has proved entirely\nsatisfactory, since perfect optical elements and a\ndust-free environment are not attainable.\nScientists and engineers at GSFC have devised an\ningenious solution to this problem. Its efficiency can\nbe seen in the photograph in figure 65, made at the\noutput image plane of a single lens optical processing\nsystem: The "bullseye" difficulty has been eliminated. The fine grid of vertical lines has been placed\nover the transparency to illustrate dramatically that\nthis noise removal technique will not distort any\ncritical spatial filtering operations.\nThe principle behind this technique, discovered by\nA. R. Shulman and G. J. Grebowsky, is simple. While\na photograph of the input image is being exposed, the\nlens is rotated about its optical axis. Figure 66 shows\nthe physical arrangement of the equipment\xe2\x80\x94basically\na small motor and a commercial bell-driven rotating\nlens mount. Since the blemish diffraction pattern\nresults from local imperfections and dirty spots on\nthe transform lens, rotation of this lens also rotates\nthe pattern. Hence, the spurious blemish images are\nspread out over concentric rings on the photograph.\nThis smears out the pattern on the photograph,and\nremoves the appearance of blemishes. Detailed mechanical drawings of the motorized lens mount are\navailable, and a patent has been applied for. Setup\nand adjustment of the system is critical (refs. 212 and\n213).\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC DATA STORAGE, PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL\n\nFIGURE 64.-Coherent output image with noise\ndiffraction patterns.\n\n79\n\nFIGURE 65.-Coherent output of gridded range.\n\nFIGURE 66.-Experimental setup of coherent noise removal.\nOptical Read/Write Holographic Memory System\n\nNASA has pioneered research in holographic mass\nmemory devices because of their adaptation to\ncompact, large-capacity computers in space vehicles\nand satellites. NASA has also been vigorously pur-\n\nsuing development of spaceborne optical data processing equipment in hopes of reducing for transmission\nthe vast quantity of raw data gathered by high\nresolution sensors and presently relayed from satellites or other remote platforms.\nThe feasibility of a 1010 -bit optical memory was\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n80\n\ninvestigated by Carson Laboratories, Inc., under\ncontract to ERC. Using available technology, this\nsystem could be built using either a surface or a\nvolume hologram (ref. 214). Memory size up to 1012\nbits is planned in a design concept by Radiation, Inc.,\nfor MSFC (fig. 67). A subarray is recorded on one\nsmall part of the overall hologram; the entire hologram array is made up of repeated different subarrays\nrecorded adjacent to each other. If the recording\nmedium is conventional film, the exposed hologram is\n\nthen processed and can subsequently be reconstructed, a subarray at a time, by the reference beam.\nReadout and recording devices in this system are\nof critical importance. The reference beam must be\naccurately aimed at the particular area of the hologram to be recorded, and the positioning for readout\nmust be exact; these two operations determine the\naccess time and error rate (respectively) of the\nprocess. Conversion of each subarray to computer\nusable data can be achieved using an array of\n\nINPUT A R R A Y\n\nHOLOGRAM A R R A Y\nX - Y DEFLECTION\nSYSTEM\n(a) Recording A r r a n g e m e n t\n\nREADOUT\nBEAM\n\nX-Y DEFLECTION\nSYSTEM\n\nHOLOGRAM\nARRAY\n\n(b) Readout Arrangement\nFIGURE 67.-Holographic memory.\n\nOUTPUT\nPHOTODETECTOR\nARRAY\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC DATA STORAGE, PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL\nphotodetectors that duplicate spacing between the\ndots in the image. Thus the entire array can be\ntransferred in parallel fashion to the computer (refs.\n215 through 217). An advanced implementation of\nthis concept has now been fabricated (fig. 68).\nThe insertion of data to be recorded requires\ncareful design, especially if high-speed operation is\nrequired. Radiation, Inc., has also designed a block\ndata composer that uses electrically alterable apertures (fig. 69). The data can be presented in either\nserial or binary form. Currently the major problem\nwith this device is in the read/write portion of the\nmemory. The composer can be recycled about 106\ntimes before it needs to be replaced, while the\nerasable photoplastic hologram recording material has\na lifetime of about 100 recycles (ref. 218).\nOne of the major considerations in developing any\ntype of holographic memory is the recording material. The desired features are:\nHigh resolution\nFast recording\nMinimum processing\nHigh stability\nHigh reversibility\nEasy erasure and/or overwrite\n\n81\n\nBroad spectral response\nHigh angular sensitivity\nHigh uniformity\nResolution governs the packing density and in turn\nthe physical size of the memory. Recording speed and\nprocessing requirements determine storage rate. Stability is needed for any extended data storage; this\nencompasses not only dimensional factors but also\nsensitivity to light exposure and environmental conditions. Reversibility governs the number of times the\nmaterial may be recycled. The capability of selective\nerasure and overwrite governs applicability to read/\nwrite memories (as opposed to read-only memories).\nIn some cases, only destructive readout may be\nfeasible, thus requiring a rewrite cycle after readout.\nThe spectral response should be sufficiently wide to\nallow the use of various frequency laser units for\npossible spectral multiplexing. A high angular sensitivity enables the storage of multiple subarrays over the\nsame location. Finally, high uniformity of the material\'s sensitivity is required for reliability and low error\nrates.\nMany materials have been studied for holographic\nrecording. Photographic emulsions can obviously be\nused only for read-only memories, although the new\n\nA r g o n Laser\nShutters\n\nn\n\nX /2-plate./r\n\nHelium-Neon Laser\n\nBeam Height\nAdjuster\n\n\'Electro-Optic\nModulator\n\nU\n\nU\n\nMirror\n\nA c o u s t o - O p t i c Beam\nDeflector\n\nBeam Expanding O p t i c s\nBlock Data Composer\nF o u r i e r T r a n s f o r m Lens\n* Hologram A r r a y\n\nImaging Lens\nAchromatizing\nSubassembly\n\nFreenel\nRhomb\n\nBeam Deflector\nOptics\n\nPhotodetector A r r a y\n\nFIGURE 68.-Optical read/write holographic memory system layout.\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n82\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nLIGHT ACCESS\nPORT\n\nFRONT\nVIEW\n\nMACHINED\nALUMINUM\nPLATE\n\nTHUMB\nSCREWS (4\n\nBENDING\nFULCRUM\nELECTRODED (2 PIECES)\n\nPLEXIGLAS\n\nEDGE\nVIEW\n(LEADS\nOMITTED)\n\nFIGURE 69.-Front and edge views of the electrically alterable block data composer.\n\narsenic trisulfide can be erased. For uses that require\nfrequent recall of extensive tabulated data, this may\noffer the best system. An MSFC study by Radiation,\nInc., recommended using photo-plastics or manganese\nbismuth for read/write implementation (refs. 216\nthrough 218).\nSome alternate materials under investigation are\nlithium niobate crystals for storage of up to 1000\nholograms per crystal (BTL); alkali-halide crystals for\n1018 bit storage (Carson Laboratories); strontiumbarium niobate crystals (Sperry Rand); iron-doped\nlithium niobate crystals (RCA); and arsenic trisulfide\nand other inorganic photochromic materials (RCA)\n(refs. 219 through 225).\nNorth American Rockwell, IBM, BTL, and New\n\nYork\'s Off-Track Betting agency are also investigating\nholographic mass memories (refs. 226 through 228).\nOptical-to-Optical Input Transducer\n\nA very important contribution to this area is\nGSFC\'s development of the optical-to-optical converter (OTTO) input device (fig. 63). This converter\ncan produce a coherent image from the input of a\nrelayed incoherent image. The importance of this\ndevelopment is its potentially wide range of application. Not only will it be valuable for data processing\noperations, but it fills the need for a near real-time\ninput composer in present holographic optical data\nstorage and holographic computer memory systems.\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC DATA STORAGE, PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL\nOTTO operates by using an auxiliary front end\noptical system to pick up a remote object and image\nit into the OTTO converter surface. Figure 70 shows\nthe design and functioning of an optical relay that\ncould be used. The coherent laser beam illuminates\nthe OTTO surface and transmits a negative of the\nincoherent image, irradiating it through to the processor.\nThe OTTO device is not ready to be incorporated\ninto a spaceborne system, but an experimental optical\ndata processing system has been demonstrated at\nGSFC with the OTTO as its input device. OTTO\'s\nmajor limitation at present is the lifetime of its\nsensitive layer (currently 100 hours of continuous\nservice) and its response time (approximately 1/10\nsec). Resolution capability is quite good at about 40\nline pairs/mm. Perfection of the device for long term\nunattended use with extremely rapid frame rates may\nbe 5 to 10 years away, but limited use in certain\n\n83\n\napplications such as holographic computer memories\nor data storage that provide easy access and replacement may be only a few years away.\nTwo versions of the OTTO are being developed.\nOne uses a single layer of bismuth silicon dioxide.\nThe other is the previously mentioned OTTO which\nconsists of a sandwich-constructed matrix of two\nlayers (one a cadmium sulfide photoconductor and\nthe other a liquid crystal layer) between two transparent conductive plates (ref. 229).\nOn-Board Spacecraft Optical Data\nProcessing System\n\nNASA investigation of an on-board optical processor concept started with theoretical work done by\nOakland University and North Carolina State University for ERC. Basic equations were derived to show\nthat a single-element lens or mirror could be designed\n\nSPATIALY\nCOHERENT\n\nMODULATED\n\nLIGHT\n\nCOHERENT\nBEAM\n\nBEAM\nLIQUID\nCRYSTAL\n\nIMAGE\n\nOTTO\nFIGURE 70.-OTTO light transducer.\n\n84\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nas a processor to include the essential input signal,\ntransform filter, and output image planes (refs. 230\nand 231).\nA. S. Husain-Abidi and T. K. Krile of GSFC\nexperimentally demonstrated the Fourier transform\ncapabilities of parabolical mirror segments by recording transforms of variously shaped objects. They also\npointed out that the use of these elements rather than\nlenses for data processing resulted in freedom from\nspherical and chromatic aberrations, eliminated front\nsurface reflections, and considerably minimized astigmatic and comatic distortions. Such a processor could\nbe constructed without the need for perfectly homogeneous and isotropic optical elements (a usual\nrequirement for lens systems) and with a more\ncompact design, due to the folding of the optical\npath. It could also be used with ultraviolet, infrared,\nor even x-ray electromagnetic radiation, which is\ndifficult, expensive, or impossible with lenses (ref.\n232).\nThe unique three-mirror segment folded processor\nshown in figure 71 was designed with on-board\nsatellite data processing in mind. The Optical Data\nProcessing and Inflight Computer (OPDIC) is at the\nbottom of the figure. Its folded optical path schematic is diagrammed in the middle, as compared to\nthe normal straight line optical path at the top. The\nsize of the folded optical computer is 6 by 3-1/2 by\n1-1/2 in. The source of coherent light is a tiny gallium\narsenide injection laser (1). Fourier transform ring\nand wedge filters or detectors can be inserted in the\nFourier transform plane (7), while the output is\nimaged on the reconstruction plane (9) and the input\nis placed in plane (5).\nSimple filtering operations have been performed\nwith this system, such as a blocking experiment in the\nFourier or frequency spectrum plane (fig. 72). The\nspatial frequency spectrum of the vertical line input\n(a) was blocked off, then the output image was\nphotographed as in (c). The spectrum consists of the\npoints in a horizontal line in the transform plane,\ndisplayed in (b) (app. D).\nThe system was also used in optical correlation\nexperiments. When a brain tissue microscope slide\n(fig. 73) was placed in the input plane and correlated\nwith a holographic matched filter (placed in the\ntransform plane) of the same slide, the bright, sharp,\nautocorrelation spot to the right of the figure was\nobtained as output. Hopefully such an operation\nconducted on a future satellite could locate and\n\n1\n\nHe Ne GAS L A S E R\n\n6\n\n?\n\nMICROSCOPIC LENS\n\n7\n\nFOURIER TRANSFORM P L A N S\n\n3\n\nPIN H O L E\n\n8\n\nIMAGE R E C O N S T R U C T I N G L E N S\n\n9\n\nIMAGE R E C O N S T R U C T I O N P L A N E\n\n4 COLIIMATING LEr.S\nb\n\nFOURIER T R A N S F O R M I N G LENS\n\nINPUT P L A N E\n\nL~\nOPDIC COMPUTER\n\n3\n\n4 OFF A X I S P A R A B O L O I D A L\nMIRROR S E G M E N T S\n\n5 INPUT PLANE\n6 FOURIER T R A N S F O R M PLANE\n7 RECONSTRUCTION PLANE\n\nFIGURE 71.-OPDIC computer.\n\nautomatically continue to track a given pattern or\nlandmark of the viewed sensor imagery.

The OTTO input matrix composer may eventually be used to insert data into this optical processor, but such a completely remote automatic system\nmay be as much as 10 years away (ref. 229). Long\nbefore that, however, modifications of the system\nmay make it possible to perform terrestrial data\n\nprocessing tasks which, although less demanding, may\nbe even more important. Some exciting possibilities\nare automatic tracking and correlation of features\ncontained in sets of organic and biological photomicroscope slides made by optical, x-ray, or electron\nmicroscopy instruments: for example, slides of brain\ntissue, optic nerves, nerve cells, blood tissue, vital\norgans, bacteria, minerals, crystals, and metal structure and flaws.\n\n86\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nFIGURE 73.-Holographic correlation of brain tissue slide.\n\nHolographic Spacecraft Attitude Determination\n\nAnother potential use for holographic data processing and storage is attitude and position determination by star map correlation. ERC supported a study\nof some of the prime components of this concept.\nThe basic theory is to match the star position output\nof a star tracker or scanner with reference star\nposition holograms in a matched filter correlator.\nRecognition of a correlation spot indicates lock-on of\nthe observed star field with the reference star field,\nwhile the position of the correlation spot indicates\nthe exact bearing from the optical axis of the\npreviously stored reference star field. The angular\ncoordinates of this displacement can be used to\ncalculate the attitude of the optical axis and of the\nsatellite or space vehicle, thus eliminating the need\nfor a restricted knowledge of star positions with\nrespect to space vehicle axes or for a special vehicle\nmaneuver now required with star mapping guidance\nsystems. GE has been exploring practical materials\nand techniques for storing a large number of star field\npatterns (refs. 234 and 235).\nMSFC has been supporting development of data\nprocessing techniques for detection of meteor trails;\nthis research resulted in selectivity and noise rejection\nspecifications for suitably matched filters (ref. 236).\nNorth Carolina State University and the University of\nMichigan conducted for NASA a series of theoretical\nstudies of optical data processing. North Carolina\nState University derived the spectrum errors in the\nFourier transform plane caused by geometric devia-\n\ntions of the input plane (ref. 231). The University of\nMichigan concentrated on methods for preparing high\ndiffraction efficiency hologram materials. There a\nvariety of bleaching techniques were developed using\ntwo- and three-dimensional gratings, and experiments\nwere performed with techniques for multiplexing\nholographic black and white and color images on\nregular and photochromic materials (ref. 237). J. N.\nHallock of ERC applied for a patent covering the\nsensitizing of hologram materials by a preexposure\ntechnique; this procedure permits relatively insensitive real-time holographic storage materials to be used\nfor some applications (refs. 238 and 239).\nCOMMERCIAL ENDEAVORS\n\nSeveral interesting advances have been made in\nindustrial holographic data storage and processing.\nCommercial Holographic Personnel Identifications\nand Verifier Systems\n\nTo date holographic identification systems, personnel verifiers, and the conventional optical processor have achieved full commercial status. The potential market for these devices looks promising, but so\nfar they have attracted only a few users with\nspecialized requirements. It takes a great deal of\ntechnical expertise and capital to become seriously\ninvolved in producing these devices.\nAt least two commercial versions of a holographically recorded identification card and personnel\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC DATA STORAGE, PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL\nverifier are currently on the market. Both have a large\nnumber of uses, such as verifying credit cards,\npassports, and bank passbooks and checks. Controlled\naccess and entrance to military installations, research\nlaboratories, vital computer areas, records depositories, pubb\'c buildings, bonded warehouses, communication control centers, drug supply areas, currency and valuables handling areas, and cargo truck\nhandling can be simplified by using these systems.\nWith one system, a hologram of the fingerprint\nand signature of the bearer is recorded on a standard\nplastic identification card. To gain access to an\nautomatically guarded area, a person inserts his\nfingertip into the built-in verifier. Using optical\nmatched filtering, the verifier compares the live\nfingerprint with the recorded one to determine\nvalidity; the process takes 3 to 5 sec using a 90-lb\ncompact unit with 120 W power (ref. 240).\nAnother system not only records the required\nidentification information as a hologram, but then\nscrambles it by an optically random code. When the\nidentification card is presented to the reader terminal\nfor decoding, the same random optical code in the\nreader allows the information to be unscrambled and\nholographically reconstructed via a closed TV monitor output. The great advantage here is that if the\ncoded information falls into unauthorized hands, it\ncannot be decoded even by sophisticated optical\nequipment without the random code. When connected to a local memory bank by computer, it can\nalso control access like the first system (ref. 241).\n\nHybrid Holographic/Digital Computer\n\nOptical Processor\n\nThe Electro-Optics Center of Harris Intertype has\ndeveloped a flexible hybrid holographic/computer\noptical data processor, the closest an advanced system\nhas been brought to production. The photograph of\nthis unit (fig. 74) shows the optical bench and lenses,\ncomputer, and readout equipment. The device, called\nthe Hybrid Optical Processor, has been used to\ndetermine the vector velocities of cloud patterns\ntaken from ATS-III satellite imagery. This operation\nrequires the complex cross- and auto-correlation\nfunctions to be calculated, located, and plotted on a\nseries of sequenced cloud imagery. Because conventional film processing delays are intolerable, complex\nfilters must be used that are generated in situ on\nphotoplastic materials. This process has also been\n\n87\n\nused for pattern recognition, character recognition,\nspectral analysis, and image quality assessment.\nThe major improvements in the hybrid processor\nover conventional commercial optical data processors\nare its selective output characteristics and in-place\ngeneration of photo-plastic complex filters. Use of a\nPDP-8/I digital computer in the processor permits\noutput to be coupled either to a cathode ray tube\ndisplay or to hard-copy output. The computer readout devices and associated threshold circuits have\nbeen designed to reduce substantially the amount of\noutput data displayed compared to the total amount\nof data processed (ref. 242 through 244). The major\nlimitation of the Hybrid Optical Processor is the lack\nof an input device to rapidly convert electrical and\nincoherent optical signals into a suitable coherent\noptical image. The OTTO device under development\nby GSFC may help alleviate this problem (ref. 229).\n\nMicrohologram Recording/Retrieval Systems\n\nRadiation, Inc., and Sperry Rand have developed a\nfew high density data storage systems to record and\nretrieve two-dimensional microholograms. Another\nRadiation, Inc., system developed for the Department\nof Defense can automatically or manually read out\none-dimensional coding information recorded on unused portions of standard microfiche or microfilm\nframes. However, the cost of these devices presently\nlimits them to users who either handle a large volume\nof dissemination copies or must use extremely high\ndensity storage in combination with high quality\nretrieval imagery. Holographic recording of high\ndensity information such as that contained in pictures, microfiche, or microfilm involves some of the\nsame basic concepts needed for the development of\nholographic computer memories (refs. 245 and 246).\nThe Radiation, Inc., microholograms will be able\nto store up to 200 times as much information as a\nmicrofiche in a standard 4 by 6 in. card. Its emulsion\nsurface stands up much better to rough treatment,\nand duplication from a master microhologram is\ncheaper and easier. Development of these systems was\nenhanced by the company\'s experience in developing\nan extremely high density holographic memory for\nMSFC (ref. 237).\nD. H. McMahon of Sperry Rand has been investigating a slightly different approach to producing\nholographic recordings, either from standard microfiche or directly from the original material. He has\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nFIGURE 74.-Hybrid holographic/computer optical data processor.\n\nsucceeded in recording microholograms using Fourier\ntransform holography techniques at an equivalent\ndensity of about 600 pages per fiche-about 10 times\nthe normal microfiche density and about 1/6 the\ndensity now possible with ultrafiche techniques. He\nbelieves that holographic recording of this type will\nultimately be cheaper, easier, more flexible, and\neasier to read out (ref. 245).\nBoth Radiation, Inc., and Sperry Rand groups\nhave also built experimental viewers that have largely\neliminated the effects of laser speckle. This is done\neither by mechanically oscillating the screen or by\nusing a "dynamic screen" viewer that also increases\nthe contrast of the projected reconstructed image.\n\nlength selection, because stationary interference patterns are not produced unless the object and reference waves are of exactly the same frequency. Making\nuse of this fundamental concept, C. C. Aleksoff of\nUniversity of Michigan developed a technique to\ndisperse the multiple frequency modal patterns of a\npulse laser into a series of concentric rings. Interference of this pattern with diffused projection of the\naxial and transverse mode patterns of the same laser\n(object beam) allowed reconstruction of the instantaneous modal pattern of a given frequency at the\ntime of exposure. This technique might be modified\nto record other simultaneous multiple frequency\nevents (ref. 248).\n\nHolographic Spectral Analysis\n\nVelocimeter Holographic Analysis\n\nHolography has been cleverly used to perform\nspectral analysis of a single pulse from a laser. A basic\nproperty of the hologram is extremely narrow wave-\n\nFor the U.S. Air Force, the Tennessee University\nSpace Institute has been investigating optical processors to automatically reduce the inline holograms\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC DATA STORAGE, PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL\nmade of particle flow fields. Depth positions of\nknown-diameter particles in a direction parallel with\nthe optical axis are determined by matching the\nhologram reconstructions with a series of optical\nholographic matched filters. Each filter corresponds\nto a given depth, and the series spans the total depth\nrange of the recorded hologram. Although the cost\nappears comparable with alternative semiautomatic\nreadout techniques, the matched filter technique may\ngive better accuracy of the depth position of particles\n(ref. 249).\n\nHolographic Electrical Signal Processing\n\nM. King has demonstrated that real-time holographic recording of wideband electrical signals up to\n3-MHz bandwidth is feasible using the optical output\nof acousto-optical ultrasonic light modulators as the\nbasic object wave. The technique could be adapted to\nrecord bandwidth signals up to 100 MHz if the most\nadvanced argon-pulsed laser and acousto-optical modulator were used. Some degradation of the reconstructed wave forms was observed, however (ref.\n250).\n\nSynthetic Large Optical Aperture Holograms\n\nJ. Wilezynski of IBM has invented a means of\ngenerating over 200-in. diameter synthetic aperture\noptical images by an innovative holographic process.\nThe heart of the discovery is the processing of actual\nimages from several smaller optical apertures into a\nform equivalent to the resolution of a larger optical\naperture (ref. 251).\n\nHolographic Fingerprint Identification\n\nThe University of Michigan and others are perfecting methods of instant fingerprint identification. The\ngreatest problem is adjusting the extreme sensitivity\nof the process so that a given class of fingerprints, as\nwell as only one individual set, can indicate partial\nmatches (ref. 252).\n\n534-778 O-74\xe2\x80\x947\n\n89\n\nInfrared Holograms\n\nSeveral researchers have made successful holograms with infrared energy. F. M. Shofmer of\nEnvironmental Systems Company used conventional\nKodak IR Film 2481 to make inline holograms (ref.\n253). LTV used a thermochromic crystalline type\nmaterial, and the Japanese are experimenting with\nphotochromic films and liquid crystal area detectors\nto record infrared holograms at the 10.6 nm wavelength. Before reconstruction can take place, the\nthermo-image on the detector must be recorded on\nordinary film (refs. 254 through 256).\nThe Army described a technique for analyzing and\nrecording holographic information on an image dissector. By this method, holograms were electrically\ntransmitted and remotely reconstructed, allowing\ndata display at many remote locations. Storage of\nimages at a central master file and remote retrieval\nand reconstruction may also become feasible (ref.\n257).\nOther Improvements\n\nJ. W. Goodman and J. D. Gaskill have conducted\nexperiments for the Air Force on methods of\nimproving the image quality obtained by remote\nholography over long paths through the atmosphere.\nThe concept permits an undistorted object to be\nreconstructed even though nonhomogeneous elements are varying with time, based on the fact that\nthe perturbed image of the object and point source\ncan be recorded while simultaneously traversing\nthrough the same part of the distorting medium.\nFurther study of these processes may enable hologram signal-to-noise ratios to be enhanced in the\nfuture; this development could have far-reaching\nresults in certain interferometry, data processing, and\nrecording applications (refs. 258 and 259).\nW. D. Hall of the University of Michigan is\ndeveloping a thermoplastic holographic recorder that\nwill use an electron beam read-in of the stored\nelectric signal. Current research is concentrating on\nthe coherent laser beam read-out of the stored images\nand effects caused by random thickness variations of\nthe thermo-plastics (ref. 260).\n\nPage Intentionally Left Blank\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nHow to Get Started in Holography\nIN-HOUSE CAPABILITY VERSUS\nOUTSIDE SERVICES\n\nholographic systems, services, or equipment can be\nobtained from the latest Laser Focus Buyers Guide\n(January issue), the Electro-Optical Master Catalog\nand the Electro-Optical Systems Design trade magazine (July issue) under such headings as Services\nSystems, Holography, and Nondestructive Testing\n(refs. 265 and 266).\nPersons with experience and training in optical\ntheory and laser systems are probably best qualified\nto perform holographic analysis and testing, although\nsome electrical and mechanical engineers have completed university and industrial courses in the fundamentals of holography. The ideal holographic team is\nan optical engineer or scientist and a mechanical\nand/or an electrical engineer. The optical specialist\nshould know some practical photography and laser\ntechnology, since film is the usual medium for\nrecording laser beam holograms. If acoustic or microwave holography is to be pursued, then an acoustic\nengineer, electrical engineer, or physical scientist is\nhighly desirable. The field of holographic data storage, processing, and retrieval is even more demanding\nand is recommended only for an expert. A solid state\nphysicist or engineer with a sound background in\noptical theory and experimentation would also be a\nvaluable addition to a team.\nFurther sources of information on holographic\ntheory and practice are thorough and readily available\n(see references and bibliography). For the mathematically inclined, Collier, Burckhardt, and Lin\'s\nOptical Holography is a comprehensive textbook. For\nthose with less mathematical background, an excellent presentation of basic engineering considerations may be found in The Engineering Uses of\nHolography, edited by E. R. Robertson and J. M.\nHarvey. Shulman explains very lucidly in Optical\nData Processing most of the fundamental optical\nprinciples and derives at least the first order holographic equations from the viewpoint and back-\n\nA company can begin using holography to solve its\nengineering, inspection, and quality control problems\neither by establishing in-house capability or by\nengaging the services of an outside holographic\napplications service laboratory (ref. 261).\nComplete holographic systems and associated optical components can be leased, or traveling holographic laboratories and their trained staffs will\nestablish temporary residence at the client\'s facilities\n(ref. 262). One company conducts a training class for\npurchasers or lessees of its holographic laboratory\nsystem for about $200, covering a 3-day formal and\napplied course for four people. Its leasing fee is about\n10 percent of the total purchase price of the\nequipment per month. The holographic laboratory\nsystems range in price from $1540 to about $24 000,\nand include lasers ranging from a 1 mW continuous\nwave helium-neon laser to a 500 mW argon laser (ref.\n263). Another company has designed a special small\nholographic laboratory system and claims that it\n"comes partially preassembled and may be set up\nwithin a few minutes-approximately 2 hours\' time is\nestimated for reading the instructions, exposing,\ndeveloping and viewing the initial holograms" (ref.\n264).\nFor straight industrial production and inspection\napplications, several companies sell, lease, or rent\npulsed laser holographic systems that can make\nvarious types of holographic interferograms. One\ncompany fully equips its service laboratory with cw\nand pulsed ruby holographic laser systems and associated equipment and staffs it with electronic and\nmechanical engineering holography specialists (ref.\n261).

NASA is particularly interested in demonstrating\npractical industrial applications developed through\naerospace research and now adaptable to commercial\npurposes. NASA\'s Technology Utilization Division\nhas branch offices at each major NASA center, and\ncan provide any interested person with the latest\nholographic materials published by NASA. This division also can arrange for qualified individuals to meet\nthe NASA specialists most closely associated with\ntheir particular area of interest. Small funding grants\nare occasionally available to a company demonstrating an ability to adapt aerospace applications to its\nown needs.\nBefore a discovered or developed application can\nbe commercially marketed, the soliciting company\nshould perform a careful patent search for associated\nor conflicting prior patents. The Holotron Corporation, a small holding company owned jointly by E. I.\nDu Pont de Nemours and Company and Scientific\nAdvances (itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Battelle Memorial Institute), holds a majority of basic\npatent rights on holographic technology, including\nbasic patents on the off-axis sideband holography\ntechnique and on the current technique used for\nacoustic holography. Some dispute the claim on the\nlatter two, and one expert insists that the "off-axis"\nholographic technique is in the public domain, but no\ncourt actions have yet developed. Although three\ncompanies (GCO, Inc., Holosonics, and Joseph Strick\nof New York) have quietly entered into licensing\narrangements with Holotron, at least two companies\n\nHOW TO GET STARTED IN HOLOGRAPHY\n\n(RCA and Holograf, Inc.) do not believe that they\nneed a license to market their holographic products\n(refs. 267 and 268).\nSeveral holographic patents and patent disclosures\nhave been assigned to NASA centers and NASA\ncontractors; rights to use these patents can usually be\nobtained from NASA by qualified companies demonstrating a useful and salable product. The Technology\nUtilization Office or Patent Office at the appropriate\nNASA Center can help interested companies with this\ntype of problem.\nHOLOGRAPHIC STATE-OF-THE-ART\nREVIEW\nTable 3 summarizes the current state-of-the-art in\nholography by functional discipline and R&D status.\nThe terminology used in the Specific Use or Product\ncolumn does not in most cases coincide with official\nproject names or trade designations. Work by NASA\ncenters or NASA-funded contractors is italicized in\nthe table.\nTable 3 clearly shows the diversity of holography\nand the advanced status of many of its branches\xe2\x80\x94\nespecially the first five categories. Commercial offthe-shelf equipment is also available for microwave\nand acoustic-ultrasonic holography. On the other\nhand, although some optical data processing equipment is commercially available for identification and\npersonnel verification, no holographic data storage or\nretrieval equipment is at present being marketed. The\ndisciplines of seismic holography, holographic optics,\nand computer- generated holography are in a research\nstatus and progressing slowly. Overall, the greatest\nconcentration of current projects is in the category of\nholographic interferometry.\nSUMMARY\nProper interpretation of results is the largest single\nobstacle to successful application of holography. For\nexample holographic interferometry now used for\nnondestructive testing of aircraft engine components\nmight also be used in other industrial operations.\nThese analyses, however, depend on the sensitivity of\nmeasurement or recording, correct readout of the\nholographic process, and, in particular, the ability to\ndistinguish between the desired characteristics and\nany characteristics not of interest. A spurious characteristic ("noise") produces minute but systematic\nchanges in the subject\'s surface that are faithfully\n\n93\n\ntranslated by the holographic process into interference fringes, thus partially obscuring the fringes\ncaused by the desirable event. The major challenge,\nthen, becomes that of sorting out the desired holographic signature from the "false" signature (ch. 6).\nSuch interpretations can be made only by people\nthoroughly grounded in both the fundamentals of the\nprocess to be analyzed and the details of the\nholographic tool being used. This knowledge usually\ncomes only through experience.\nIn our eagerness to learn about and enthuse over\nspectacular current and projected applications of a\ndeveloping technology, there is a tendency to forget\nthe relatively unglamorous groundwork that has been\ndone or remains to be done in developing and\nsynthesizing new techniques and methodologies. Initial efforts to prove the feasibility of such new\ntechniques often duplicate feats that have been\naccomplished before in a much simpler way, and\nearly feasibility devices often lack the performance\ncapabilities to complete the task they were designed\nfor.\nTwo common errors can result. First, the potential\nmay be overemphasized and the need to establish\nadequate foundations minimized, so that predictions\nfor practical application are too optimistic and\nanticipate too short a development time. Second, an\nopposite overreaction may occur when developments\nfall short of the first rosy predictions. This can lead\nto unjustified pessimism about the new technology\'s\npractical value because of imagined insurmountable\nproblems and physical limitations. Fortunately outlook and predictions usually become more realistic as\nmore and more practical applications are developed.\nThe author believes that this cycle has already\nbeen experienced with laser technology and that\nholographic technology is still going through the\npessimistic overreaction period. For example, laser\nperformance in the early 1960\'s was inadequate to\nburn holes in anything thicker than balloons and\nrazor blades, while holography fell far short of\nimproving the resolution of electron microscopy-the\ntask it was initially and so brilliantly conceived to do.\nCarbon dioxide and argon lasers are today welding\ntogether and drilling holes in respectable gauge metals\nand other materials. Holography was used just last\nyear to improve the effective resolution of electron\nmicroscope plates.\nIn the interim, some scientists and engineers have\nhad little faith in either.

stepchild of laser technology, only an amusing\ntoy. Others kept working quietly, overcoming limitations and problems by their inventiveness and insight.\n\nToday the practicality of laser technology is being\ndemonstrated daily, and holography is on the threshold of general public recognition. Throughout,\nNASA has made and will continue to make important\ncontributions to holographic development.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nWhy and How the Hologram Works\nAn excellent explanation of how a recorded\nhologram can reconstruct a three-dimensional image\nis based on the concept of a zone plate in optics (refs.\n9 and 10).\nConsider the simple hologram produced by a\npinhole in the aperture plane shown (fig. 75) being\nilluminated by the plane wave incident from the left.\nAn arrangement where the object is placed directly\ninto the reference beam is called inline holography as\ndistinguished from holography using a separate reference and object beam called sideband holography\n(figs. 4 and 5). The object beam can be represented as\na spherical wave radiating out from the pinhole O\nwhile the reference beam is the undisturbed part of\nthe plane wave incident on the hologram.\nIf the aperture plane becomes vanishingly small so\nthat all that is left is a mathematical radiating point\nobject and a coherent reference beam, then the\nnature of the interference fringes can easily be\nderived. Since the reference ray straight through the\npinhole travels the same distance as either the object\nor the reference beam, the intersection of that ray\nwith the film produces a bright constructive interference spot. The ray itself is called the axial ray. The\ncone of object rays at an angle A0j with the axial ray\nwill be just long enough so that they all destructively\ninterfere. with the reference rays to form the first\ndark fringe in the shape of a circle. The cone of rays\nat a greater angle A02 with the axial ray produces the\nsecond dark circular fringe, and so on. In between\neach dark fringe circle there will be a bright constructive fringe; note that toward the outer edge of the\npattern, the distance between successive fringes gets\nsmaller and smaller. This pattern of circular dark and\nbright fringes is called a zone plate.\nThe zone plate is used as a substitute for a lens,\nand its chief property is to focus a plane wave of light\nstriking it normally into a point at some distance\nalong its axis (ref. 10). A schematic (fig. 76) is\n\npresented in the vertical cross-sectional plane containing the axial ray and illustrates this effect. Only the\nrays which, upon diffraction, constructively interfere\nat the focus spot pass through the plate. The rays that\nwould have caused destructive interference by diffraction at the focus spot are blocked out by the dark\nfringes.\nThere is another important property of the zone\nplate. When illuminated by the plane wave, some of\nthe energy or rays are deflected or diffracted in a\ndiverging manner in such a direction that they appear\nto come from the point P\'. This is called the "virtual\nimage" of the zone plate. The rays forming the real\nand virtual images are diffracted at equal but opposite\nangles from the direct undisturbed beam direction\n(fig. 76). When these diverging rays are observed and\nsome are collected by the eye at position E, one\n"sees" point Ff as seen from above. If you moved\nyour eye down to another section of the hologram at\nposition E\', you would still see I", but as seen from\nbelow. Point P1 is called a "virtual image" because the\nobserved rays do not pass through point P1, while\npoint P is called a "real image" because the observed\nrays do pass through it. In summary, the reillumination of the hologram zone plate by the same\nreference wave that formed it "reconstructs" a\nthree-dimensional image of the original pinhole P.\nThe reconstructed virtual image of point P is formed\nat its original distance from the hologram plate, and\nthe conjugate real image P" forms an equal distance\nin front of the plate along the axial line.\nIf only a portion of the original hologram is used\n(for example between breaks //\'), the image of P1 at\nE can be seen just as before, but it cannot be seen at\nE1 because of the restricted field of view. This is true\nbecause every area of the zone plate hologram within\nthe field of view recorded both the object and the\nreference beam. The real image formed at P will not\nbe as bright, and its resolution will not be as high,\n\n99\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK, NOT FILMED\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A\n\n100\n\nREFERENCE\nBEAM\n\nFIGURE 75.-Forming a hologram of a point object.\n\nRECONSTRUCTING\nREFERENCE\nBEAM\n\nFIGURE 76.-Reconstructing point object hologram.\n\nAPPENDIX A\nsince only a small portion of the total rays forms its\nimage (refs. 9 and 11).\nAny object, no matter how complicated, can be\nmade up of a sum of reflecting or scattering points in\nthree-dimensional space. Hence when that object is\n\n534-778 O-74\xe2\x80\x948\n\n101\n\ncoherently illuminated and a hologram is recorded,\neach point will form its own zone plate interference\npattern. Consider the whole holographic pattern to be\nthe superposition or integration of all the point zone\nplate patterns into a complex interaction pattern.\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nHologram Mathematical Demonstrations\nIn this appendix the process of recording a\nhologram is developed mathematically, showing in\ndetail how the virtual and real images can be\nreconstructed by using the offset plane reference\nwave. The discussion also demonstrates the reciprocity of the reconstruction process. A simplified\nnotation is used in which upper case letters indicate\ncomplex quantities and lower case letters represent\nscalars. The complex quantities have a real and an\nimaginary part or component, while the scalars have a\nreal part only.\nIt can easily be shown that the product of a\ncomplex quantity, Z, and its complex conjugate, Z*,\nforms a scalar equal to the square of its absolute\nvalue. This mathematical property is used extensively\nin the following proofs.\nThe intensity of any light wave, a scalar proportional to its energy density, can be expressed as the\nproduct of its complex amplitude, AL; and its\ncomplex conjugate amplitude, A\xc2\xa3 \xe2\x80\xa2 AL can mathematically represent the phase and amplitude of a wave.\nIts real part, \\AL \\, represents the amplitude of a wavefront, and its imaginary part, e\'e, represents the\nphase, 9, of a wavefront. Therefore\n\nUpon multiplying out the terms, we get\nih=R - R * + O - O * + R -O*+R* -O\n\nNow let R \xe2\x80\xa2 R* = ir, and O \xe2\x80\xa2 O* = iQ, where if and i0\nare scalars equal respectively to the intensity of the\nreference and object wave. Therefore equation (2)\ncan be written as\ni =\n\n\\ e\'ie =\n\nO*+R*-O\n\n(3)\n\nIt is possible to process the hologram film so that its\ncomplex amplitude transmission, Th , will be proportional to the exposure or intensity of the interference\nwave, 4- Therefore (ref. 272)\n(4)\n\nWhen the hologram is illuminated by the original\nreference wave, R, the complex amplitude of the\nreconstructed wave transmitted through the hologram\nis quite simply the product of R and Th , or\n\nR \xe2\x80\xa2T h =k(i r -\n\n\'L =A L\n\n(2)\n\nR - 0 * + R \xe2\x80\xa2 R* O)\n(5)\n\n(l)\n\nwhere the absolute or real value is indicated by the\nsymbol \\A^ \\ (refs. 270 and 271).\nThe complex amplitude of the interference wave\nilluminating the hologram, A, can be represented as\nthe sum of the complex amplitudes of both the\nreference wave, R, and the object wave, O; or A\nequals 0 plus R. Hence the intensity of the interference wave, ifj (another scalar), exposing the plate\nwill be equal to\n\nConsider if and i0 as average macroscopic exposures. If the reflections from the object are\ncompletely diffused, then although there is microscopic interference fringe structure, the average density of the film as seen by the eye is very nearly equal\nacross the entire hologram area for the i0 exposure.\nThe reference wave is assumed to be a plane wave and\nits exposure, ir, is also constant across the hologram.\nEquation (5) can be simplified making use of the\nrelationship R \xe2\x80\xa2 R * = ir to investigate the meaning of\nthese terms.\n\nih =A - A* = (R + 0)(R + O)* = (R+O)(R* + O*)\n103\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\n104\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nH\n\n(6)\n\nR\n\nThe first term is just a constant k(ir + ro) times the\nreconstruction complex amplitude R; this wavefront\ntravels on through the hologram in the same direction\nas the original reference wave and is, therefore, called\nthe dc term. The third term is the most interesting\xe2\x80\x94it is\na constant kir times the complex amplitude, O, or\nthe original wavefront coming from the object to\nexpose the hologram. Hence this reconstructed wave\nis diffracted from the reference beam by the hologram and travels in exactly the same direction and\nwith the same relative amplitude as did the original\nobject wave, O. Furthermore this wave, when viewed\nthrough the hologram, appears to be radiating from\nthe object and cannot be distinguished from the\noriginal object wave form. This wavefront forms the\nvirtual image of the object.\nThe second term is harder to interpret, but it can\nbe seen to be the conjugate of the complex amplitude\nof the object wave modulated by the term k(R \xe2\x80\xa2 R).\nWe have already seen that the O complex amplitude\nrepresents the original wave spreading out or diverging from the object; we can also show mathematically\nthat its complex conjugate amplitude, O*, represents\na wave focusing down or converging into the object.\nTherefore it represents the real focused image of the\nobject. This reconstruction of the real image, however, generates image aberrations because it is modulated by the term (R \xe2\x80\xa2 R) that has some phase\ncharacteristics.\nWe will now show that if we can find a way of\nilluminating the hologram with the complex amplitude R* instead of R, a real image free of aberrations\nis formed. For example if R is a plane wave incident\nin some direction 6 to the hologram axis, it can be\ndesignated as R = \\ R \\ eie ;then R* will be a plane\nwave incident on the hologram from the rear along\nthe same line but in a directly opposite direction,\xe2\x80\x940, or\n180\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\x94 9. The wave front R* can then be designated\nas R* = \\R\\e~ ie . When R* illuminates the hologram,\nthe complex amplitude equal to R* \xe2\x80\xa2 Th will be\nformed; or taking R* times equation (4) we nave\n\nR * - T =k \\ir-R\n\nR\n(7)\n\nor\n\nr\nR * - T h = k \\ R*(i r + i 0 ) + i r\n(8)\n\nNow it can be clearly seen from the second and\nthird terms that the real image O* is perfectly\nreconstructed, as is a modulated version of O (the\nthird term). This is the preferred way of reconstructing the real image of the object, and it is positioned\nabout the reflected center of the original object if the\nhologram has not been moved.\nThese same equations can easily demonstrate the\nreciprocity of the reconstruction process. Consider\nwhat happens when the hologram of equation (2) is\nilluminated not by the reference wave amplitude,./?,\nbut by the wave transmitted through or reflected\nfrom the original object, O. By forming the product\n0 \xe2\x80\xa2 Th, a second modification of equation (5), the\nmodified terms of equation (5) are\n0 - T =k \\0(ir + i0) (0-0*)R + (0- O)R*\\\nJ\nL\n(9)\nThe first term is the reconstruction object wave\nmodulated by the constants (ir + i0); the second term\nis the reconstructed reference beam modulated by the\nconstant, iQ; while the third term is related to the\ncomplex conjugate of the reference wave. The reconstructed reference wave can be focused down to a\ncorrelation spot and is the basis for correlation\nmatched filtering.\nNow imagine that the reference wave, R, is not a\nplane wave but a wave reflected from a second object,\nO2. Consider that the illumination of the original\nhologram was formed by Oi + O2 rather than 0 +R.\nAll the equations we have derived so far hold if we\ntransform the complex amplitude,/?, into 02 and the\ncomplex amplitude, O, into Oj.\nLet us now examine the reconstruction we have\ncalculated in equation (9) in light of this transformation. The illumination by Oi has resulted in the\nreconstruction of the virtual image, O2. The first\nseries of illuminations by O2 and O$ (equations 6 and\n8) resulted in reconstructions of O\\ and Of. It\nfollows that illumination by Of results in the\nformation of the real image of Of. Thus the\nreconstructions are reciprocal relationships, and this\nfact can be made the basis for either correlation\nfiltering or coding (ch. 9) (ref. 273).\n\nAPPENDIX C\n\nHologram Classifications and Performance Parameters\nThis appendix discusses the eight classifications of\nholograms mentioned in chapter 2 and describes\nprincipal performance parameters used to characterize all types of holograms.\nCLASSIFICATIONS\n\ntion forms an image by transmitting the reference\nbeam through it, while a reflection hologram forms\nits image by reflecting the reference beam from its\nsurface, or from interior surface planes in the case of\na thick volume reflection hologram.\nThick/Thin, Volume/Plane Holograms\n\nTransmission/Reflection Mode Holograms\n\nA hologram must be recorded in either a transmission or a reflection mode, indicating different exposing geometries. If the object to be holographed does\nnot transmit light, the reflection mode must be used;\nif it does, either mode can be used, depending upon\nthe application. For example in thin film and particle\ncontamination monitoring, the reflection mode gives\ninformation about the surface particle deposits, while\nthe transmission mode provides information on the\nthin film layers (ch. 6).\nThese two exposure modes can be further subdivided into diffusely scattered transmission object\nbeams, diffusely reflected object beams, nonscattered\ntransmission object beams, or specularly reflected\nobject beams. The diffusely reflected or scattered\nobject beam ensures the property of fragmentation\nand redundancy so important to data storage and\ndisplay applications, but the price paid for this\nredundancy is a speckle pattern in the viewed\nreconstructed image. This speckle appears as excessive\ngraininess like that observed in enlargements from\nfast photographic film. It can be reduced by using\nlarge aperture lenses to replace the small aperture\nhuman eye during the reconstruction phase, by\nmechanically moving displays, or by dynamic electric\ndisplays (ch. 4) (ref. 274).\nThe terms transmission and reflection hologram\nare also quite often applied to the reconstruction of a\nhologram rather than to its recording. In this case a\ntransmission hologram means one whose reconstruc-\n\n105\n\nHolograms are also classified according to the\nthickness of the recording medium into thick and\nthin or volume and plane holograms. As the names\nimply, these categories are based on the effective\nactive depth or thickness of the recording material\ncompared with the wavelength dimension. Throughout much of the earlier discussions, we have been\ndescribing the holographic process as essentially the\nrecording of an interference fringe pattern on the\nsurface of film. But if the material or emulsion is\nthick and relatively transparent to the illuminating\nradiation, these interference fringes are produced not\nonly on the surface but also throughout the volume\nof the emulsion. When the emulsion is developed, a\nset of three-dimensional layers is then formed within\nthe emulsion, corresponding exactly to the positions\nof the illuminating interference fringes.\nFigure 77 illustrates this effect for both object and\nreference point sources. The three-dimensional interference fringes throughout the volume of the media\nare, represented by the dotted lines. As illustrated by\nfigure 77b, upon reconstruction the developed density layers act as planes throughout the volume of the\nemulsion. Essentially, they reflect energy only in\nthose directions where the angle of reflection can\nequal the angle of incidence (the simple mirror law of\noptics).\nThere must also be a definite relationship, called\nthe Bragg condition, between wavelength, X, interfringe plane spacing, d, and angle of incidence, 0, if\nthe reflections from neighboring planes are to add\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n106\n\nOBJECT POINT\n\n(a)\n\nFRINGES\n\nREFERENCE POINT\nSOURCE\n\nRECORDING\nMEDIUM\n\nVIRTUAL IMAGE\n\n(b)\n\nREFERENCE SOURCE\n\nFIGURE 77.-Formulation and reconstruction of volume (thick) hologram.\n\ntogether coherently. This Bragg condition is given by\nthe equation\nl\n\n6 =cos \' ^2d\nFigure 78 illustrates this for the case of straight line\nfringes formed (fig. 78a) by interference of an object\nand reference plane waves. Only the rays of wavelength Xi will be constructively reflected at the\nproper angle (as indicated by rays labeled 3, fig. 78b)\nwhen illuminated by white light at incidence angle of\n0 to the fringe planes. All other wavelengths will be\nobserved or scattered.\nAnother very important effect of these reflecting\nplanes in the volume hologram is to increase the\ndiffraction efficiency of images formed by the reconstruction illumination, since in general the Bragg\nreflection process is far more efficient than the usual\ndiffraction or scattering process in optics (refs. 275\nand 276).\n\nColor/Monochrome Holograms\n\nSince one set of three-dimensional interference\nplanes can be formed by a single wavelength exposure\nin the emulsion, there is no reason why a second\nmonochrome exposure at the same wavelength, made\nlater on the same volume of emulsion, could not form\na second series of interference planes. If the angle of\nthis second set were made substantially different\nfrom the first by changing the reference beam\norientation, then reconstruction crosstalk would be\nminimized because the respective reference beams,\nwhen sequentially illuminating the hologram, only\nreconstruct from their own associated sets of Bragg\nreflecting planes.\nThis is the basis for storing multiple superimposed\nmonochrome images for efficient data storage; it can\nalso be used to provide color separation negatives\nrequired for three-dimensional color picture projection. Each three-dimensional color negative illumi-\n\n107\n\nAPPENDIX C\n\nX\n\no\n(a)\n\nREFERENCE\nBEAM\n\nFRINGES\n\nOBJECT\nBEAM\n\nRECONSTRUCTED\nOBJECT BEAM\n\n(b)\n\nPLANE\nILLUMINATING\nWAVE OF\nWHITE LIGHT\n\n\xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\xa2 z\n\nFRINGES\nFIGURE 78.-Fringe formation, reconstruction by Bragg reflection.\n\nnates the hologram from a different angle. If the\nmultiplex recording illumination is carried out by\nthree different monochromatic wavelength beams,\nthen the direction of the reference beams between\nsuccessive multiplexed exposures need not be\nchanged\xe2\x80\x94in fact the exposures can be performed\nsimultaneously. Each color then produces reflection\nplanes of the same angular orientation but with\ndifferent spacing and intensity in the hologram; and\neach set of planes in turn can be sorted out properly\nduring the reconstruction, since only its associated\ncolor provides the necessary conditions for strong\nreflection. This selectivity is so good that the thick\nmulticolor hologram can usually be illuminated from\nthe back by a strong incoherent white light source to\n\nform a high resolution colored three-dimensional\nimage (ref. 277).\nOptical/Microwave/Acoustic/Seismic/\nComputer Holograms\n\nHolograms are sometimes categorized in terms of\nthe type of radiation, wave disturbance, or equipment\nused to form them. "Direct" holograms are produced\nby wave interference, while the pattern of "indirect"\nholograms is calculated by high-speed computers.\nComputer calculations specify the position, shape,\nand size of a synthetic array of apertures which when\nilluminated by the reference wave will reconstruct the\ndesired object. This object need not be real. The array\n\n108\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nof apertures is either duplicated on film or fabricated\ninto some other material to form the "computer\nhologram." Usually these apertures are binary holes,\nbut they can be made of varying density material (ref.\n278).\nThis survey is primarily concerned with optical\nholograms, although all coherent forms of radiation\ncan form holograms. Techniques exist for building up\nholograms from incoherent photographs or radiation\nrecordings. Because nonoptical radiation holograms\ncan record directly the amplitude and phase of fringes\nfrom objects, the reference beam is not always used\nduring recording. In fact the synthetic aperture\nsidelooking radar really exhibits a perfect application\nof one-dimensional holography as it records microwaves reflected from the terrain (ch. 8). Microwave\nholography actually predates coherent optical holography using lasers. It was developed about the same\ntime that Dennis Gabor made his remarkable discoveries using incoherent sources in 1948 and 1949.\n\nin film or sensitive layers (either present before or\nproduced during development) are particularly\ntroublesome. Most of these material variations can be\neliminated by using a "liquid gate" during projection.\nIn the gate, the film recording the amplitude hologram is immersed in a tank of liquid whose index of\nrefraction matches the index of the film. The total\neffective thickness of the combination then remains\nconstant even if the film thickness varies; hence all\nwave modulation is caused only by density changes.\nThese liquid gates are complex and expensive, however, and do not allow rapid film movement.\nThe amplitude modulation process for thin holograms is extremely inefficient because, in general,\nonly 1 or 2 percent of the illuminating radiation is\ndiffracted into the reconstructed image. Diffraction\nor reflection from the thick, amplitude modulated\nvolume hologram is better but can still stand much\nimprovement.\nTime Average/Single or Double Exposure Holograms\n\nAmplitude Phase Holograms\n\nWe have already seen how only the phase change\nof either the reference or the object beam can cause\nchanges in the fringe interference pattern recorded on\nthe hologram material (ch. 2). It is reasonable to\nexpect that changes of either amplitude, phase, or\nboth in the reconstruction beam can be used to form\nvirtual or real images for display and measurement,\nand this is in fact the case. The hologram affecting\nprimarily the phase of the illuminating beam is called\na phase or phase-only hologram. This phase shift is\ndeveloped by a change in either the thickness of the\nmaterial or its index of refraction. Both occurrences\neffectively change the optical path length of the beam\nthrough the material at various plate positions, and\nhence cause phase diffraction of the reconstruction\nbeam. If the material can be made nonabsorbing, then\ngreatly improved diffraction efficiencies are possible.\nMost holograms, however, are composed of absorbing layers or volumes which diffract the reconstruction light beams through differential absorption\ninto the proper images for viewing. The spatial\nmodulation of the hologram\'s amplitude transmission\nis usually easier to produce and control than the\nphase transmission and so far has resulted in the\nmaximum resolution obtainable.\nWhen amplitude holograms are reconstructed,\nspurious phase changes caused by thickness variations\n\nTime average holography (ch. 6) is the continuous\nexposure of reflections from a vibrating object. The\nobject usually goes through several vibration cycles\nduring the exposure time, and continuous wave lasers\ncan be used.\nIn double-exposure holography, two wavefront\nrecordings are made on the same film. When it is\nilluminated, the two sets of interference fringes\nrepresenting each exposure form "interaction" fringes\nof their own. The separate interference fringes are\noften too fine to be observed, but the interaction\nfringes can be seen quite clearly and give a vivid\nrepresentation of the geometric changes produced on\nthe object between the two exposures. Normally, the\nobject is subjected to various types of pressure,\ntemperature, density, or force stress between exposures, but many other types of movement or\nmaterial accumulation can be observed. For example\na fast growing plant might exhibit movement due to\ngrowth or oscillation between two time-lapse hologram exposures.\nSingle-exposure holography, also called real-time\nholography, involves a stationary, usually unstressed\nobject. After development, the hologram is placed in\nthe same location where it was exposed (this position\nmust be accurate to a fraction of a wavelength) and\nlighted by the same reference beam. Looking through\nthe hologram, the observer then sees both the\n\nAPPENDIX C\n\nreconstructed virtual image and the real object\nexactly superimposed. If the object is slightly stressed, such as by the pressure of a finger, interaction\ninterference fringes can immediately be seen (in real\ntime) between the object and its unstressed image.\nMovement of the hologram plate will produce still\nanother fringe pattern. This technique is useful for\nsetting up experiments and measurements before\nactual photographs are made, and is also the basis for\nobtaining motion pictures of fringes caused by\ndynamic motions of the object (ch. 7).\n\nSideband/Inline Holograms\n\nThe geometry of hologram production (sideband\nor inline) has a striking effect on the nature of the\nhologram and on its properties during both formation\nand reconstruction. The principal categories of sideband holograms are Fourier transform and Fresnel\nholograms. These classifications and their subcategorizations probably determine the usefulness of a\nhologram to a greater extent than any characterization so far discussed.\nInline and sideband holography are characterized\nby their inability or ability to separate out the virtual\nand real images so that they do not interact and can\nbe separately observed. We can think of this separation as being accomplished in sideband holography by\nmodulating the virtual and real image spatial video\ninformation on two different high frequency band\ncarriers. This is done by using an object beam and a\nreference beam to illuminate the hologram plate from\ntwo different directions (figs. 4 and 5). Subsequently\nthe two images can be separately recovered through\nproper filtering of the reconstructed carrier signals.\nIn the sideband hologram technique, the carriers\nare actually spatial frequencies, and the demodulation\nprocess of separating out the two types of images is\naccomplished by directing the virtual and real image\nsignals into different directions. The two separate sets\nof reconstruction lenses at the eyeball\'s different\npoint of observation can then be considered as spatial\nfilters that accept only the proper range of spatial\nfrequencies (refs. 279 and 280). Interference between\nthese waves on the hologram is similar to mixing\nthese various frequencies together to form sum and\ndifference frequencies (refs. 281 and 282). The\ninterference fringes are just the beats of the different\nfrequencies, while the nonlinear terms that also result\n\n109\n\nfrom the nonlinear t/E characteristic curve of the\nhologram are the harmonics of the sum and difference frequencies.\nAppendix D develops in further detail the correspondence between spatial frequency components\nand directions of propagation in optical systems (refs.\n281 through 284).\nFourier transform hologram: A wave focused in\nthe back focal plane of a transform lens has both an\namplitude and a phase. A Fourier transform hologram\nis made by the interference between the amplitude\nand phase (complex amplitude) of the frequency\nspectrum waves in the transform plane and a plane\nreference wave. An important characteristic of the\nFourier transform hologram is that it places a\nminimum spatial frequency requirement on the recording material. However, the dynamic range of the\ninterference wave\'s intensity can be very large indeed\nwith such an arrangement. This means that when such\nholograms are used for matched filtering (app. D),\ngreat care must be taken in their exposure, processing, and development.\nA stringent condition on the Fourier transform\nhologram is that it must be formed by a plane object\nor transparency; therefore this type of hologram is\nused only for data storage or optical processing.\nMotion by the object in the front focal plane of the\ntransform lens during hologram exposure does not\ncause any change in the amplitude of the image in the\nback focal plane. This property of Fourier transform\nholograms has been applied to holographic motion\npicture projection and holography of moving objects\n(ch. 7) (ref. 285).\nFresnel hologram: Another form of sideband\nhologram useful for all types of objects and applications is the Fresnel hologram, which gets its name\nfrom the fact that it is recorded without any lens and\nis placed very near the object. The plate records the\n"near field" diffraction pattern, called the Fresnel\ndiffraction pattern of the object. Although these\nholograms are quite easy to form, their chief disadvantage is the wide band of spatial frequencies that\nmust be recorded by the plate.\nA third type of sideband hologram is the focused\nimage hologram. The NASA scientists who originally\ndiscovered the principle behind its construction predict that it will be useful in relaxing constraints on\nthe coherence and size of the source needed to\nreconstruct and produce a hologram (ch. 3).\nInline holography is sometimes used to simplify\n\n110\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\nthe optical recording process. Using only a plane\nreference wave, the diffraction pattern of an object,\nsuch as a series of small particles, can be recorded at\nan "infinite distance" from the hologram plate (called\nFraunhofer diffraction). Such a recording is an inline\nhologram (ch. 3). When this hologram is reilluminated, the real image contribution is so defocused\nthat it appears only as a very slight uniform additional dc intensity component added to the virtual\nimage diffraction pattern. Fortunately, finite distances can often satisfy the "infinite distance" or far\nfield distance requirements in practical situations.\nThe far field distance is expressed as proportional\nto the ratio of the squared radius of the object\nparticle to the wavelength of exposing light (ref. 20).\nThe far field condition can also be realized by placing\na lens beyond the particle\'s diffraction pattern to\nfocus the pattern onto the recording medium. The\nFraunhofer diffraction pattern or far field diffraction\npattern is formed in the back focal plane of the lens.\nInline holography is sometimes called Fraunhofer\nholography, and inline holograms, Fraunhofer holograms.\nHOLOGRAM PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS\n\nThe most important measures of hologram performance are connected with the characteristics of\nthe reconstructed virtual and real images. As might be\nexpected, these characteristics are also intimately\nrelated to the media upon which the holographic\ninterference patterns have been recorded. The final\nappearance of reconstructions is of course also\nconstrained by the nature and quality of the recorded\npattern. If the holographic system setup has been\ncarelessly designed so that, for example, the spatial\nfringe resolution exposure requirements exceed the\nresolution capabilities of the recording media, degraded resolution image will result.\n\nDiffraction Efficiency\n\nThe brightness of the reconstructed image is\nimportant for viewing because the eye can seldom\nresolve all the resolution capability inherent in the\nrecording medium; it usually judges the quality of a\nreconstruction by the brightness of the projected\nimage. Image brightness is determined by the power\ndensity of the illuminating source and the diffraction\n\nor reconstruction efficiency of the developed hologram. The reconstruction efficiency is defined as the\nratio between the amount of power diffracted or\nprojected into the viewed image and the total amount\nof power in the incident beam striking the hologram.\nThe square root of this efficiency is equal to the ratio\nof amplitudes between the diffracting and illuminating wave, and it is important to keep this ratio linear.\nIf this amplitude ratio becomes nonlinear during an\nexposure, then all sorts of image perturbations,\ndistortions, and aberrations take place during reconstruction (ref. 282).\nEfficiency/Recording Ratio/Exposure Tradeoff\n\nFigure 79 clearly shows the complexity and\ninteraction of the important parameters of exposure\n(\xc2\xa3), and the ratio of recording reference to object\nbeam intensities (R) that determine the diffraction\namplitude efficiency (\\/TJ) of the reconstruction. A\nseparate set of these diffraction efficiency characteristic curves must be developed for each recording\nmaterial, and modifications to the actual magnitude\nof the curves must be determined by the nature of\nthe scene recorded on the hologram. The curves of\nfigure 79 are based on idealized plane wave object\nand reference beams.\nExposure\n\nThe need to determine exposure accurately is\nobvious, since both underexposure and too high an\nexposure cause loss of efficiency. This occurs especially as the recording beam ratio approaches unity,\nwhich normally is expected to give the highest values.\nFigure 79 clearly shows the critical nature of the\nexposure value necessary to obtain a linear relationship between the square root of the reconstruction\nefficiency and the fringe visibility. Only the exposure\ncurve labeled E3 appears to satisfy these conditions\n(ref. 286).\nThe need to record in the linear characteristic\nregion also constrains the relationship between the\nintensity of the light producing the hologram exposure and the length of exposure time. Since the\nexpected motion of the object to be holographed\nvery strongly dictates the range of exposure times to\nbe tolerated, the power output of the laser source\nmust be great enough to provide the necessary light\nbeam intensities on the hologram.

Recall the first illusTABLEIV.-Properties of Holographic\nRecording Media\n\nThe final resolution of a projected or viewed image\ndepends upon a rather complex tradeoff analysis\nbetween these major factors: the nominal f/n of the\nrecorded hologram, the effective aperture of the\nhologram exposure, the aberrations in the reconstructed image, and the speckle grain size in the\nimage. The maximum theoretical diffraction limited\nresolution is obtained from the nominal f/n of the\nhologram, equal to the ratio of recording distance to\ndiameter of hologram plate (fig. 80). The smaller the\nf/n the higher the resolution (ref. 287). However, the\neffective diameter of the hologram is sometimes\nreduced at the edges of the plate where the recorded\nfringe frequencies are apt to be highest. If the\nresolution capability of the recording material is\nexceeded, then that part of the hologram is washed\nout and the effective diameter and hence hologram\nf/n decreases proportionately.\nThe geometric arrangement of the object and the\n\nAbsorptive\n\nRecording\nMedium\n\nTypical\nExposure\nTypical\nResolution, Required,\nLines /mm ergs /cm*\n\nPhotographic\nEmulsions\n\nOver\n2000\n\n20-1 03\n\nAandP\n\nPhotochiomic\nMaterials\n\nOver\n2000\n\n10" -10\'\n\nA\n\nPhoto polymer\nMaterials\n\nOver\n1000\n\n10" -106\n\nP\n\nThermalPlastic\nMaterials\n\n1000\n\n10-100\n\nP\n\nDichro mateSensitized\nGelatin\n\nOver\n2000\n\n10s\n\nP\n\nElectrooptic\nCrystals\n\nOver\n4000\n\n10\'\n\nP\n\nResolution\n\n(A) or\n\nPhaseOnly (P)\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n112\n\nHOLOGRAM\nPLATE\n\n"WIN\n\nOBJECT\n\nMAX\n\nF/N = d/D <\n\nREFERENCE\nSEAM\n\nOBJECT\n\nMAX\n\nHOLOGRAM\nPLATE\nF/N = d/D > 1\n\nFIGURE 80.-Hologram/number variation.\n\ntration of the hologram formed by the two plane\nwaves (fig. 1); if the angle between the object and\nreference beams is increased, then the spatial\nfrequency of the interference fringes increases and\nhence the resolution requirements of the film or\nrecording material increase comparably. The\nresolution requirement can be .quantitatively\nexpressed by the simple equation\nJr =\n\n2 sin (1/2) 6*\n\\\n\nwhere fr is number of line pairs per unit of length\nrequired to be recorded by the material; X, the\nwavelength of the recording light, and 6, the angle\nmade between the reference and object beam. When\none beam is normally incident upon one side of the\nmedia and the other beam is normally incident from\nthe back side, the spacing angle 6 is maximum and\nequal to ISO0. In this case the required resolution is a\nmaximum and equal to 2/X line pairs per unit of\nlength. This geometry is frequently used when making thick volume holograms (ref. 6).\n\nAPPENDIX C\nFigure 80 clearly shows the relationship between\nhologram f/n and the required fringe resolution f/r\nthrough the angle 6 between the direction of the\nreference beam and the object beam. Note how the\nlarge f/n hologram results in small angle 0 and little\nvariation between 6MAX and GMIN- From the\nequation above this means the resolution to be\nrecorded is low. The small f/n hologram illustrated at\nthe top (which will give the maximum projected\nresolution) requires a high fringe resolution to be\nrecorded at its bottom because of the large value of\nOMAX- Some material might not be able to record\nsuch a high resolution, and part of the hologram\nwould be ineffective in projection.\nThe effect of discrepancies between theirecorded\nand reconstructed geometry. ari\'d-ithe"departures from\nplane way^. reconstruction illumination will often\nintroduce into the projected image the usual third-\n\n113\n\norder optical system image aberrations, causing a\nfurther decrease in the resolvable elements per unit\nlength in the projected image. The number of\nresolvable elements in the reconstructed image is\ninversely proportional to the wavelength of the\nilluminating source and the effective f/n of the\nhologram. Final image resolution loss might be\nintroduced by excessive diffuse scattering that could\ncause speckle-noise grain sizes greater than the\naberration resolution limits. Careful design of the\nequipment setup or the use of compensating lens and\ndisplay units can usually overcome these speckle\neffects (ref. 287).\nFinally, table 4 shows the major limits on exposure and resolution capabilities of the major holographic phase and amplitude recording media being\ncurrently studied and developed for practical use\n(refs. 288 and 289).\n\nPage Intentionally Left Blank\n\nAPPENDIX D\n\nHolographic and Optical Data Processing Principles\nOPTICAL SPATIAL FREQUENCIES\n\nOPTICAL TRANSFORMS AND FILTERS\n\nWe will use figure 81 to illustrate how it is possible\nto analyze any optical image into its two-dimensional\nspatial frequency components. The basis of the\ndemonstration is the concept that a bundle of parallel\nrays propagating at different angles with the optical\naxis represents different spatial frequencies, and that\nthe greater the angle from the axis the higher the\nspatial frequency content.\nConsider the interception of two bundles of plane\nwaves of this type which are traveling in directions\ndefining a vertical plane containing the y axis (fig.\n8la). We have already seen (ch. 2) that they produce\ninterference fringes that are evenly spaced horizontal\nlines parallel to the x axis (fig. 1). It is a well-known\ngeometrical optical property that a perfect thin lens\nfocuses all of a parallel bundle of rays to a point\ndefined by the intersection of the ray passing through\nthe center of the lens with focal plane. Thus the\nbundle directed down at some angle B from the axis\n(fig. 8la) focuses into the spot labeled\xe2\x80\x94/i on the> >\naxis, while the upwards directed wave bundle, also at\nangle B, focuses at the spot labeled +fl on the y axis.\nIt is.also a well-known principle in optics that a\nperfect lens images in its back focal plane the\ntwo-dimensional spatial frequency spectrum (or twodimensional Fourier transform) of any image located\nin its front focal plane. This is a remarkable property\nof a lens extensively used in Fourier transform\nholography and optical data processing. The spatial\nfrequency spectrum in the transform plane is normalized so that the dc frequency component, the rays\nparallel with the axis, is focused right on the optical\naxis, while the higher frequency components are\nfocused on circles of increasing radius from the\naxis. The polar directional displacement from the axis\nis related to the angular direction of propagation of\nthe spatial frequency components making up the\nimage (ref. 290).\n\nThe concept of an optical image being made up of\nspatial frequency components in two dimensions is\nextremely useful; it aids understanding of all optical\nfiltering and optical data processing operations. Just\nas the audio output frequency characteristics of a\nhigh fidelity sound system can be expressed as the\nproduct of the amplitude and phase of the frequency\ncomponents contained in the stereo tape or record\nwith the frequency and phase response curves of the\nhi-fi system, so the output spatial frequency characteristics of an optical system are equal to the product\nof the amplitude and phase of the spatial frequency\ncomponents of the object image with the spatial\nfrequency and phase response of the optical system.\nThe complete specification of the response of an\noptical system is called the optical transfer function.\nAs implied above, it is made up of two parts: the\nmodulation or amplitude transfer function and the\nphase transfer function. Any distortion or aberration\nof the image formed by an optical system can be\nexpressed by an appropriate form of the amplitude or\nphase response of the system. An optical transform\nfunction can express not only the effect of lens\naberrations on a normally focused image but also\neffects due to lens defocusing, object motion, scintillations, and refractive inhomogeneities along the\noptical path.\nSeparate components of an optical system cascade\nor multiply their frequency response curves together\nand add their phase responses together to form the\ntotal system output. If one of the components of an\noptical system is a transform lens and the other an\noptical filter, consider the cascading operations possible when the filter is placed in the transform or\nFourier frequency plane. In the simplest case, the\nfilter can be an opaque plate with a small hole cut out\nto allow only a few of the component frequencies to\npass through.

Such a filter is called a bandpass\nfilter or a blocking filter.\nBy producing the proper transmission as a function of position, any amplitude modulation transfer\nfunction can be synthesized. If the filters were made\nof concentric rings about the axis of varying trans:\nmissions, then the filter frequency response would\nbecome independent of the input image\'s orientation.\nFilters of this type are being developed for image\nevaluation processes (ch. 9). If instead of having a\n\nvariety of densities the rings are varying thicknesses\nof transparent material, then phase shifts rather than\namplitude changes are produced by the filter, and\nvarious phase transfer functions can be synthesized.\nHowever, the simultaneous control of both amplitude\nand phase of a film or plate was very difficult before\nthe advent of holography, and all practical filtering\ninvolved only simple blocking or spatial frequency\nattenuation filters. Correction for deblurring, lens\naberrations, or other types of image distortions by\noptical filtering was very imperfect, since the degrading phase effects of the object and the correcting\noptical system could not be compensated for.\n\nAPPENDIX D\nHolography has changed this. Holograms opened\nup the possibility of recording on a photographic film\nor other light-sensitive surface both amplitude and\nphase or complex transform functions. The original\ndiscovery made by VanderLugt at the University of\nMichigan* consisted of recording a Fourier transform\nhologram by imaging the object function through the\ntransform lens onto the hologram using a normal\noff-axis reference beam setup. Such a filter or\nhologram has the remarkable property of representing\na complex filter only by its absorption qualities, not\nits phase perturbing characteristics (ref. 291); therefore this filter can be placed in a liquid gate to\neliminate spurious phase effects. These holographic\ncomplex filters -can be used to perform deblurring,\nimage enhancement, and correlation filtering (refs.\n292 and 281).\n\n117\n\nTEST MATERIAL\nUNDER STRESS\n\nh U.YI\n\nT\n\n-FOURIER TRANSFORM\nHOLOGRAM\n\nF (MX.Y)} F- {su.YJ}\n\n|\n\nHolographic Matched Filtering or Correlation\nFunction Measurement\n\nFigure 82 shows how a Fourier transform hologram of an unstressed solder joint is made, developed,\nand then placed back in its original position for\nfiltering. If this unstressed solder joint located on the\ntest material board is again illuminated by the laser,\nits Fourier transform image wavefront will be incident upon the hologram filter, as shown by the\ndotted lines in the figure, making the wavefront\nidentical to the original object wave that formed the\nfirst Fourier transform hologram. Since the hologram\nis illuminated by its object wave, its reference wave\nwill be reconstructed** (app. B). Because its\noriginal reference wave was a plane wave off axis, the\nreconstructed wave will also be a plane wave off axis\nfocused by a lens to a spot on the photo multiplier\ntube as shown in the figure. The intensity of this spot\nwill be equal to that produced by the original\nreference wave. Consider its value as a normalized\nmaximum of one unit; the value of unity represents\nthe maximum value of the autocorrelation function\nof the spatial frequencies of the unstressed joint with\nitself.\nHowever, to measure the change of the stressed\nsolder joint from its original unstressed form, a\nslightly different procedure is required. The hologram\nmust be illuminated with the image of the thermally\n*Now with Radiation, Inc., Electro-Optics Center.\n**There are special cases when these generalizations are not\ncorrect (ref. 207).\n\nFIGURE 82.-Configuration for measuring deformations\nby Fourier transform holography.\n\nstressed solder joint after it has returned to equilibrium temperature. Instead of reconstructing a perfect reference wave replica, only a part of the\nreference wave is reconstructed, and the intensity of\nthe spot on the PM tube will be less than unity. This\ndecrease of intensity can best be understood by\nsaying that the parts of the illuminating new object\nwave that are exactly like the original object wave\nwill reconstruct a portion of the reference wave as\nbefore, but since there will be parts of the new object\nwave that are not similar to the original, the intensity\nof the reconstructed wave will be less. It seems logical\nthat the intensity of the reconstructed spot will be a\nmeasure of the similarity between these two images,\nand indeed it can be proven that the spot will\nmeasure the exact cross-correlation function between\nthe unstressed and stressed reflectance versus spatial\ncoordinates (refs. 200, 201, 208 and 209).\nHolographic Image Deblurring and Spatial Filtering\n\nAnother very important optical processing function operation that can be carried out is called the\nconvolution operation or the spatial frequency filtering process. Image deblurring is the inverse of a\nconvolution operation.\n\nHOLOGRAPHY-A SURVEY\n\n118\n\nAC f MOM 8(xV)=7f(x.y)h(x\'-x.y\'-y)dxdy\n\n^>\n\n\xc2\xa7Ml\xc2\xa3tt^fe\n\n\'\xc2\xa3,"?"\n\n\'\n\nG(u.v) = F(u.v)H(u.v)\n\nBlurred Photo\n\nH=H*\n\nIHl7\n\nf I-Q\n\nDeblurred Photo ^\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC FOURIER-TRANSFORM DIVISION FILTER\n\nh\n\n0\xe2\x80\x94c\n\n,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa23\n\nBlurred Point\nSharp Point\n*\n\nDeblurred Point\n\nD [J-\n\nFourier\nSpectrum\n\nFiltered (Equalized)\nSpectrum\n\nHOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE DEBLURRING\nAlter;\nG.W STROKE and RG. ZECH (1967)\n\nFIGURE 83.-Holographic image debluiring.\n\nThe best description of a convolution process is a\nsuperposition or a process of repeated addition. An\nordinary optical lens performs a convolution when\nforming an image of an object. In this case, the blur\nfunction of a lens is the shape and amplitude of the\ndistorted image formed by the lens of a perfect point\nsource object, due to the aberrations or imperfections\nof the lens. The image formed by a lens of any object\nwill merely be the superposition- on the image plane\nof all its blur functions represented by the points in\nthe object.\nAnother more familiar way to think about the\naction of the lens on the object is to consider the lens\nas modifying the component spatial frequency of the\nobject, both in amplitude and phase, by some type of\ntransform relationship. Figure 83 is a diagram that\n\nillustrates the deblurring process. It is similar to the\nsetup of figure 82 except that the optical path can be\nstraightened out and simplified because the object is a\ngraphic transparency. Note that the transform division takes place in the Fourier or spatial frequency\nplane, u, v. Because of practical considerations the\noperation is performed by two filters which successively multiply by ff* and I/// 2 . The result is\nmultiplication by \\/H (u, v), the reciprocal of the\nblurring function transform, H (u, v), and hence a\n, cancellation of the blurring effect. After the multiplication operation, the final lens transforms the resultant image back into the space or image plane x l , y l .\nThe blurred image on the left was sharpened to the\nimage on the right by this process (refs. 209 through\n211).\n\nGlossary\nAberrations (of image)\xe2\x80\x94Distortions in shape,\ncolor, focus, and density of images caused by\nimperfect optical elements (i.e., lens, prism, mirror, screen, etc.).
