At monthly intervals the microbial profile (feces, nose, and throat) of each dog was assessed. After 12 months it was found there was no drastic alteration or simplification of the microbial profile of isolated or control dogs. Although isolated dogs had slightly higher levels of anaerobic bacteria and somewhat lower levels of enterococci, the major groups of anaerobic, aerobic, and facultative bacteria remained qualitatively and quantitatively similar for the 12-month study period. Although they  were only minor components of the fecal flora, Candida albicans and Shigella sonnei were consistently isolated in larger numbers from the  dogs in the locked environment.", "title": "Effect of a prolonged stay in a locked environment on the microbial flora in dogs", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T03:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750030012, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Balish, E."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "a9803e2f53284100815af136348844d3"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19750030012, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Shih, C.-N."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "f6e9be8412cd4b4cb43ccbea1f05d431"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19750030012, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yale, C.
