Furthermore, this cooperative\nagreement helped prepare future graduates to develop the revolutionary intelligent propulsion\ntechnologies that will be needed to ensure pre-eminence of the U.S. aerospace industry.\nThis Propulsion 21 \xe2\x80\x93 Phase ll program consisted of four primary research areas and associated\nwork elements at Ohio universities: 1.0 Turbine Engine Prognostics, 2.0 Active Controls for\nEmissions and Noise Reduction, 3.0 Active Structural Controls and Performance, and 4.0 System\nStudies and Integration. Phase l, which was conducted during the period August 1, 2003, through\nSeptember 30, 2004, has been reported separately.\nSignificant Accomplishments\n1.0 Turbine Engine Prognostics\nDisk Life Meter \xe2\x80\x93 Cyclic Bulk Damage Understanding and Model Development, and\nSurface Damage \xe2\x80\x93 Oxidation and Corrosion (OSU)\nCyclic Bulk Damage Understanding and Model Development\nIn this subtask, OSU conducted characterization studies of LCF samples provided by GE Aviation\nin order to develop a detailed understanding of the damage mechanisms operative as a function\nof temperature, strain range and number of cycles.\nThis effort was focused on characterization of LCF samples taken to failure. Features\ncharacterized include microstructure (specifically \xce\xb3' size and distributions), deformation\nsubstructure and fractography of failure surfaces.\nCharacterization of the deformation substructure after low cycle fatigue testing at varying test\nparameters (test temperature and strain range) and microstructure resulted in distinctly different\ndeformation mechanisms. Although a more detailed study of each of these mechanisms are\nneeded in order to fully characterize the exact nature of matrix dislocations, partial dislocations,\nand stacking faults (SISF vs SESF) the following conclusions can be made based on this work:\n1) Dislocation slip bands were found to be a prevalent deformation structure in nearly all of\nthe specimens. The density of dislocations within the slip bands were more intense at\nlower temperature and high strain range while at higher temperatures the dislocations\nwere less dense within the bands.\n2) Stacking fault shear is also observed in many of the specimens which occur as a results\nof shear by either 1/3<112> or 1/6<112> dislocations and creates either a SISF or SESF.\n3) Microtwinning was observed when fatigued at 1300 \xc2\xb0F. This mechanism has also been\nidentified under monotonic creep conditions in tension at the same temperature.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942008-215226\n\n1\n\nOxidation and Hot Corrosion\nThis study determined quantitative information regarding the extent and morphology of hot\ncorrosion damage evolved upon the surface of Ni-based superalloy Rene 104. Exposure times\nunder an accelerated corrosion regime at 704 \xc2\xb0C range from 0.5 to 100 hrs. Unlike oxidation, it\nwas seen that hot corrosion proceeds at an alarmingly rapid rate. The evolution of high\ntemperature damage can be distinguished into two regimes. The first describes damage\noccurring at low exposure times, corresponding to what we ascribe as a phenomenon of transient\noxidation, leading to a pitted surface. Following a distinguishable incubation period, hot corrosion\ndamage proceeds such that damage depths are typically several hundreds of microns, with a\ngeneralized attack mode dominating the corrosion observed. Characteristics of the damage\nevolution were quantified via optical profilometry, while microscopy and XPS were used to\nsupport mechanistic interpretations. The following conclusions were drawn:\n1)\n\n2)\n3)\n\n4)\n5)\n\nOptical profilometry coupled with image analysis enabled full quantification of pit\nformation and hot corrosion growth kinetics. This made it possible to develop an\ninterpolative empirical model to accurately capture the corrosion damage growth kinetics.\nMicroscopy and XPS offered complimentary insight into the corrosion mode and\nmechanisms at play.\nIt was seen that hot corrosion displays an incubation period prior to large-scale hot\ncorrosion. This period was seen to be greater than 5.5 h. Corrosion damage evolution\nwas phenomenologically represented as selective carbide oxidation causing pitting\nattack, followed by S-related hot corrosion leading to rapid general attack.\nThe ultimate level of hot corrosion attack sustained at 704 \xc2\xb0C under these test conditions\nis seen to be severe.\nXPS indicated a lack of Cr oxide present upon the alloy surface with continued exposure\ntime, this was concomitant with increasing levels of S containing compounds; leading to\naggressive corrosion.\n\nBearing System (UAk)\nThe objective of this program was to enhance knowledge about engine class A accidents\n(characterized as damage greater than $1M or loss of life) by improving the knowledge database\nconcerning the mechanisms of spall inception and propagation and the role of material fatigue\nunder high temperatures in rolling element bearings. The added objective to the creation of the\ndatabase was the design and certification/validation of high temperature wireless sensors. The\nstrategy involves the creation of the database using hard-wired sensors that are attached to both\nrotating races of a differential intershaft bearing, and then progress to implementation and\nvalidation of wireless sensors first at low temperatures (below 400 \xc2\xb0F) and then at higher\ntemperatures, more characteristic of temperatures in a jet engine. It should be noted that there\nhave been cases when the time from spall initiation to catastrophic failure was less than 10 hours,\na fact that is worrisome if one considers the average time of an in-flight single mission. To\nmitigate such a problem one needs to improve the bearing\xe2\x80\x99s material, design (intelligent\nbearings), the strategy of sensor combinations and data acquisition (pressure, temperature,\nacceleration, flow, debris, etc), sensor sensitivity and especially reliability (avoidance of false\nsignals) and in-line intelligent health monitoring and data processing.\nWithin the WCI and Propulsion 21 programs the UAk has become a statewide partner in the Ohio\nCenter for Advanced Power and Propulsion (OCAPP) and has been designated as the center of\nexcellence and expertise in the domain of bearings and seals in Ohio. The University has\nresponded by erecting a dedicated building to the OCAPP integrated technical and collaborative\nefforts, The Turbine Research and Testing Facility has been built in record time, less than one\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942008-215226\n\n2\n\nyear, and became available for service in June 2006. The Intershaft Bearing System Test Facility\nwas built within period of 5 months and became ready for commissioning at the end of November\n2006. The facility incorporates:\n(a) The test head\n(b) The slave bearings lubrication loop\n(c) The test bearing lubrication loop, the compressed air feed system containing two\n200 HP Ingersoll-Rand compressors an accumulator tank and associated control and\nsafety systems\n(d) The air turbine driver system\n(e) The slip rings lubrication circuit\n(f) The glycol closed system cooling circuit with its control and safety systems\n(g) The electric motor-eddy drive cooling system with its control and safety systems\n(h) The pneumatic load system load with its motorized pressure regulator\n(i) The local master control cabinet containing all elements for local installation control\n(j) The NEFF low speed data acquisition system\n(k) The National Instruments high speed data acquisition system\n(l) The computer based air turbine drive control system\nAll these systems have been built and integrated into one functional unit that is ready for\noperation.\n\nAdaptive Controls for Fault Accommodation (OSU)\nPart 1 of this effort involved the estimation of immeasurable parameter such as thrust and turbine\ninlet temperatures in turbine engines which constitutes a significant challenge for the aircraft\ncommunity. A solution to this problem is to estimate these parameters from the measured outputs\nusing an observer. Currently existing technologies rely on Kalman and extended Kalman filters to\nachieve this estimation. This work involved an adaptive observer that augments the linear Kalman\nfilter with a neural network to compensate for any nonlinearity that is not handled by the linear\nfilter. The neural network implemented is a Ardial Basis Function Network that is trained offline\nusing a growing and pruning algorithm. The adaptive observer was used to estimate HPT inlet\ntemperature, thrust and stall margins.\nPart 2 was concerned with fault detection, which plays a critical role in aircraft engines and the\nperformance of their control systems. A real challenge in fault detection applications is the design\nof a scheme which can distinguish between model uncertainties and occurrence of faults.\nTherefore, a technique to accommodate uncertainties in the model, help in reducing false alarms\nand missed detections is essential for the enhancement of engine operations. In this effort, a\ndynamic/adaptive threshold algorithm was developed for aircraft engine fault detection based on\nboth \xe2\x80\x98unstructured\xe2\x80\x99 time-varying perturbations in the model parameters as well as external\ndisturbances. The residuals are errors between estimated and measured variables of the outputs.\nWith this design approach, the residual crossing the dynamic/adaptive threshold indicates the\noccurrence of fault. By this method of \xe2\x80\x98dynamic/adaptive threshold\xe2\x80\x99, model uncertainties do not\ntrigger a false alarm as in normal case with a constant threshold. Simulation results base on an\nengine Component Level Model (CML) are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942008-215226\n\n3\n\n2.0 Active Controls for Emissions and Noise Reduction\nIntelligent Combustor \xe2\x80\x93 Well Stirred Reactor (UD)\nThe Well Stirred Reactor (WSR) is a versatile laboratory research combustor that simulates the\nhighly turbulent combustion process in a practical gas turbine combustor. UD studied highturbulence level turbulence-flame chemistry interactions processes in a high pressure (20-atm)\nWSR. Specifically, the WSR provides bench-mark quality data on effects of pressure on lean\nblowout (LBO), NOx, and particulate emissions.\nDuring this phase of the program, the University of Dayton performed the following tasks:\n(1) Assemble and check out the high pressure WSR\n(2) Baseline WSR tests at room temperature and pressure using various fuels\n(3) WSR Data interpretation and reporting\nUD designed, fabricated, and assembled a WSR with the following specifications:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOperating pressure = 1-20 atm.\nAir flow rates: 2.0 lbm/sec\nFuel flow rate: 0.2 lbm/sec\nResidence Time = 2-8 ms\nEquivalence ratio = 0.3-2.5\nFuels: Jet A, JP-8, heptane and decane.\n\nHigh-pressure WSR experiments and test results have direct practical applications in gas turbine\ncombustor design in terms of improving combustion efficiency, combustion stability, fuel economy\nand decreasing pollutant emissions. Results and conclusions of these studies are of direct\npractical benefits to NASA Glenn, GEAE, and Parker-Hannifin and also the Air Force Research\nLaboratory (AFRL)\n\nIntelligent Combustor Control \xe2\x80\x93 TAPS/LBO/Lean Flammability Limits (UC)\nManifestations of combustion instability in a multiple swirl low emission gas turbine combustor\nwere studied. Unstable combustion was investigated in different combustor setups, including with\nor without a premixing section, and with gaseous and liquid fuel via measurement of dynamics of\npressure, flame and radical emissions. A set of four optical fibers integrated inside the multiple\nswirler fuel injector assembly monitored the local active radical emissions to provide phase\ninformation on unsteady dynamics. The acoustic pressure signal from a microphone was\nconditioned as the trigger signal for phase-locked OH* chemiluminescene imaging of the global\nflame. The flame dynamics are shown to be in different format for different geometries and types\nof fuel. The motions of the flame front are shown to be closely related to the combustion instability\ndriving mechanism, either periodic large flow structures or pulsation in the fuel line. Analysis of\nthe transition from unstable to stable combustion revealed that the advantage of better mixing\nwith gaseous fuel was offset by the faster growth rate of pressure oscillations. It was also found\nthat the oscillations of pressure lead flame in both gaseous fuel and spray combustion when\nunstable combustion takes place.\nCombustion dynamics pose serious challenge for modern low NOx emission gas turbine\ncombustors. Accurate detection of pressure oscillation signals associated with combustion\ndynamics is crucial for control of combustion dynamics and assurance of reliable operation and\nextended life time of the engines. However, the installation of the pressure transducer is often\nlimited by the temperature the sensor can withstand. This effort addressed the possible signal\ndistortion due to commonly used pressure sensor installation on a stand-off tube. The effects of\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942008-215226\n\n4\n\nthe tube and extension \xe2\x80\x9ctails\xe2\x80\x9d lengths on the measured pressure signals using different types of\npiezoelectric pressure transducer are described. A two-dimensional wave tube is used to\ngenerate clean planar waves for this study. The stand-off tube was found to be responsible for\npseudo peaks in the spectrum whose frequency depends on the tube length. The extension \xe2\x80\x9ctail\xe2\x80\x9d\nalso modifies the spectrum of the detected signal by introducing low frequency modulation of the\nspectrum. For proper signal detection, the length of the tube has to be carefully selected to avoid\nartificial distortion of signals at the frequency range of interest.\n\nIntelligent Combustor \xe2\x80\x93 Active Combustion Control/MEMS (CWRU)\nPrototypes for a \xe2\x80\x98smart\xe2\x80\x99 microvalve have been developed. The developed MEMS technology\nsupports the development of necessary fuel modulation techniques for the Active Combustion\nControl work element of this research program.\nThe \xe2\x80\x98smart\xe2\x80\x99 valve is comprised of the microvalve itself as well as a micromachined flow sensor\nwith the necessary read-out electronics to enable a fully closed-loop control scheme. The\nmicrovalve utilizes a piezoelectric actuator with novel pressure balancing and mechanical\namplification schemes. Tests with de-ionized water show 7% modulation at a flow of 100mL/min.\nat a pressure of ~20 psi when the applied drive voltage set to 50 Hz is varied from 84-120 V. The\ncantilever type volumetric flow sensor utilizes piezo resistive techniques for read-out. Tests of the\nflow sensor in de-ionized water showed flow measurement capability at room temperature for\nflows up to 660 mL/min. Separate high temperature tests of the flow sensor interface IC\nimplemented in an inexpensive bulk CMOS process showed stable performance beyond the\ntargeted operating temperature requirement of 250 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nActive Noise Reduction \xe2\x80\x93 Fluidic Injection, Shape Memory Alloys & Acoustic Liners (UC)\nThis effort investigated the potential for using fluidic injection on both fan and core\nstreams to reduce subsonic turbofan jet noise. Fluidic injection consists of small jets of air\ninjected directly into the shear layer between two jet streams. This injection induces\nstream-wise vorticity in the flow which entrains air between the streams and yields\ngreater mixing relative to conventional configurations without fluidic injection. Enhanced\nmixing has been shown to reduce the mean jet velocity and temperature, therefore,\nreducing jet noise. Fluidic injection experimental testing was performed in three-stream\nflow at the GE Aviation Anechoic Free-Jet Test Cell 41 Facility. Test results demonstrate\njet noise peak sound pressure level reductions of 1 to 2 dB, resulting in a maximum\noverall sound pressure level reduction of 1.6 dB. The greatest jet noise reduction occurs\nafter optimizing the balance between low frequency noise reduction and high frequency\nnoise generation.\n\nActive Noise Reduction \xe2\x80\x93 Plasma Injection (OSU)\nLocalized arc filament plasma actuators were used to control an axisymmetric Mach 0.9\njet with a Reynolds number based on the nozzle exit diameter of about 7.6x105. Eight\nactuators, distributed azimuthally inside the nozzle, near the nozzle exit, were used to\nexcite various azimuthal modes of the jet over a large frequency range (StDF of 0.1 to\n5.0). Time-resolved pressure measurements were used to investigate the development of\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942008-215226\n\n5\n\nactuation perturbations and instability waves in the jet, PIV measurements were used to\nevaluate the effects of control on the mean velocity and turbulence field, and far-field\nsound was measured to evaluate the control effect on the radiated acoustic field. The jet\nresponded to the forcing over a large range of excitation frequencies with varying\ndegrees. When exciting at low frequencies, the instability waves grew slowly, saturated\nfarther downstream, and stayed saturated for a longer time before decaying gradually.\nThe saturation and decay of instability waves moved farther upstream as the excitation\nfrequency increased. Instability waves with higher azimuthal modes exhibited faster\ndecay. PIV results showed that when exciting the jet preferred mode instability at lower\nazimuthal modes, the jet\xe2\x80\x99s potential core shortened and the turbulent kinetic energy\nsignificantly increased. For higher frequencies and higher azimuthal modes, forcing had\nless of an impact on the mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. Far-field acoustic\nresults showed a significant noise increase (2 to 4 dB), more at 90\xc2\xb0 than 30\xc2\xb0, when the jet\nis excited around the jet preferred mode instability frequency (StDF = 0.2-0.5), in\nagreement with the results in the literature. Noise reduction of 0.5 to over 1.0 dB is\nobserved over a large excitation frequency range - this reduction seems to peak around\nStDF = 1.5 to 2.0 at 30\xc2\xb0 angle, but around StDF = 3.0 to 3.5 at 90\xc2\xb0 angle. While forcing the\njet with higher azimuthal modes is advantageous for noise mitigation at 30\xc2\xb0 angle and\nlower frequencies, the effect is not as clear in higher forcing frequencies and at 90\xc2\xb0\nangle.\n\n3.0 Active Structural Controls and Performance\nThermal Management & Advanced Cooling (OSU)\nTurbine Cooling Control \xe2\x80\x93 Combustor Simulator\nThis portion of the program was designed to significantly improve the capability to obtain film\neffectiveness measurements and the analysis of those resulting measurements for a fully cooled\nhigh-pressure turbine stage operating under design corrected conditions. After many years of\nsuccessful development, the experimental state-of-the-art has now advanced to the point where\nthese measurements are currently being obtained under as realistic of conditions as can be\nproduced under laboratory-controlled conditions. This includes the ability to generate combustorlike flow path temperature profiles at the entrance to the high-pressure turbine vane (HPTV),\nrepresentative turbulence intensity at the inlet to the HPTV, and duplication of the coolant flow\nparameters consistent with actual engine operation. All of the technology developed as part of\nthis program is being utilized within the ongoing NASA/DoD URETI measurement program.\nTrailing Edge Cooling of Turbine Blades\nThis study was divided into two parts, the first directed towards developing an analytical model for\nrather simple geometries to study the effects of rotation and bleed. The second approach centers\naround the numerical computation of the flow in a trailing edge cavity using a realistic model for\nthe trailing edge geometry which was provided by the General Electric Company.\nIn an attempt to understand the complicated problem of trailing-edge cooling on a turbine blade, a\nstudy has been initiated with the long term goal of simulating steady, rotational internal flow in a\ntrailing edge cavity with pressure side bleed ports. An additional goal of the study was to develop\nsome insight as to how trailing edge cooling can be optimized.\nThe results were representative of a number of calculations performed for a variety of cases.\nParametric studies for various values of wall temperature, pressure, and most importantly,\ndifferent distributions of the mass flux outwards from the eighteen pressure bleed slots were\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942008-215226\n\n6\n\nconsidered. as part of this study. It was hoped that the numerical results would allow us to\nascertain if there were an optimum distribution of mass transfer, or other parameters that would\nbe beneficial in optimizing the thermal management for such configurations. Unfortunately, for the\ncases considered no optimum situation could be deduced, at least for the cases studied in this\neffort during the time allotted for the project.\nAn attempt was made at trying to modify the shape of the turbine blade geometry used in this\nstudy. However, the complexity of the shape made it impossible to successfully redesign the part.\nFinally, the case wherein the part was also allowed to rotate, like those cases considered in the\nanalytical models analyzed above, was evaluated. Efforts were not successful. The CFX\nsoftware, while having an option for a rotating frame of reference, did not converge to a >good=\nsolution, at least not for the cases considered in this study. It was not clear what the difficulties\nwere. Certainly, additional studies which concentrate on the rotational aspects of the flow are\nwarranted.\nCooling Flow Injection Bench Tests\nThis work describes the configuration of the AARL/OSU 3 inch by 6 inch transonic heat transfer\nwind tunnel and summarizes the results of a basic preliminary test program incorporating four\ncoolant injection configurations. The primary flow was impulsively heated to approximately 350 \xc2\xb0F\nat a Mach number of 0.6 to 0.8. Data were acquired from a thin-skin data module, a segment of\nthe wind tunnel wall, with and without cooling flow injected upstream from the data module.\nReduced and normalized heat transfer coefficients are reported over a wide range of cooling flow\nrates. Reductions of as much as 40% are reported for a tangent-slot injection configuration.\nTurbine Cooling Control \xe2\x80\x93 Unstable Profile Prediction, Enhanced HT, Tech Demo (UC)\nEffort 1\nSteady and unsteady pretest predictions have been performed of the OSU test rig. This case\nincludes purge cavities that were simulated. The steady multi-stage solutions were performed\nusing a multi-stage \xe2\x80\x9cmixing-plane\xe2\x80\x9d approach in which the unsteady connection between upstream\nand downstream blade rows is replaced by a steady axially symmetric inflow condition. Unsteady\nresults were performed with a forced unsteady profile formed from the upstream exit flow.\nThe purpose of the effort was to understand how purge cavity flows affect the temperature\nprofiles at the exit. Steady results indicate that the purge flow exits the cavity in a circumferentially\neven manner, whereas the unsteady solutions demonstrate a defined coalescence of the purge\nflow in two areas, one along the hub on the pressure side and the other somewhere between 20\nand 30% span on the suction side. The latter propagates essentially mid passage and provides\nno associated cooling, although it does significantly affect the averaged exit temperature profiles.\nInstantaneous solutions show that there is a range of locations where this purge flow travels but\nthe time averaged effect is still a relatively distinct feature. The results suggest inclusion of purge\ngeometry effects is necessary for accurate prediction of this flow field.\nEffort 2\nThe complete UC Combustion Research Facility was computed as part of this effort. Grid\ngeneration was a major aspect of this exercise and was the bulk of the work performed. The UC\nCRF consists of a cylindrical combustor made of perforated steel for enhanced mixing. This can\nresides in a circular pipe and is fed by an external fuel line. The circular pipe is then connected to\nan unloaded cooled stage-one turbine vane which resides in a rectangular duct. The transition\nfrom the circular to the rectangular flow path takes place in a transition region. The stage-one\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942008-215226\n\n7\n\nturbine vane is cooled with 64 holes including 4 rows of showerhead cooling and 2 rows on the\nflat portion of the geometry. These cooling holes are inclined to the main flow and are\nrepresentative of typical cooling strategies. The simulation of the vane utilized symmetry and\nconsisted of half the main flow, the associated cooling holes and the coolant feed plenum. The\nvane geometry was computed previously in isolation and resulted in an approximately 14 million\ncell grid. The complete combustor, transition duct, stage-one vane grid resulted in upwards of\n50 million grid cells. The objective of the gridding for all main flow surfaces was to obtain surfaces\non which y+<1. This was achieved over most of the domain.\nThe grid generation process was then followed by several initial solutions, the first of which were\nperformed to obtain reasonably accurate initial y+ values to further guide the gridding process.\nCold flow cases without fuel were computed with these good grids and form the basis for further\nstudies.\nEffort 3\nThe third effort in some senses straddled both main tasks. It was initially proposed that a cooled\nversion of the OSU test rig be simulated and coolant unsteadiness studied both from the\nperspective of the rotor/stator interaction and from possible pulsed coolant approaches designed\nto offset detrimental effects of the former. Unfortunately, this geometry was not provided to the\ninvestigators forcing the use of the available cooled unloaded vane from the UC CRF [1].\nPrevious studies of this geometry had been performed and it offered both a platform for continued\ngrid generation development and a convenient geometry for pulsed cooling.\nThe initial effort was directed at understanding available experimental data. Previous heat\ntransfer experiments were performed by Ou et al. on a similar geometry but with \xe2\x80\x9ccoolant\xe2\x80\x9d warmer\nthan the main flow. The idea being that a heat transfer analogy could be constructed. The current\nwork then explored whether this idea is a workable strategy for a full turbine blade. The results\nsuggest that while it may be possible to match conditions over a spanwise averaged portion of\nthe vane it is not possible to match local details of the flow. The situation is improved if only a\nsingle row of holes is employed and indeed better data matches to cool coolant are possible over\na select range of the spanwise averaged analysis. But the use of multiple holes removes the\npossibility of a reasonable match over the entire vane surface. In addition, local variations cannot\nbe correctly correlated. The effort explored the ideas of matching velocity ratios, mass flow ratios\nand momentum ratios, but none were reasonable approaches without a priori knowledge of the\nsolution.\nThe effort was then shifted to study pulsed cooling. The idea was to explore the effect of pulsing\nthe feed plenum flow and understanding the relationships between coolant forcing, film response\nand local cooling effectiveness. This work is ongoing.\nSmart Containment System (UAk)\nThe general objective of this research was to investigate possible scenarios of crack\npropagation in a composite softwall containment system due to forces produced by the\nunbalanced fan after the blade out event in the engine. The particular objective of this study\nwas to apply a force-moment system to the front flange of the containment in a dynamic and\nstatic way in order to propagate the crack from the initial hole.\nIn the first step of the investigation, the blade-out was simulated to produce a realistic hole in\nthe containment. Results of the simulation were also used to assess the loading produced by\nthe interaction of the unbalanced fan with the undamaged section of the containment system.\nIt was found that the containment can be subjected to twisting, shearing and bending forces\nand moments.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942008-215226\n\n8\n\nThe post impact loading conditions were studied parametrically using LsDyna3D for a\ndynamic case and ABAQUS implicit code for a static load application. In each case, the\nenergy stored in the inner housing and stresses in elements of highest stress concentration\nwere measured. LsDyna3D simulations demonstrated crack initiation and propagation for the\napplied moments. It was observed that the crack path depended on the type of elements\nused and the density of the mesh used in the simulation.\n\n4.0 System Studies and Integration\nSystem/Optimization Studies (OSU)\nThe overall purpose of this study was to determine the effect of engine component\ndegradation on performance and the progression of component degradation as a function of\nengine cycles or service time. The effect of degradation was approached using a fairly\ndetailed simulation of two specific engine tpes, based on actual engine models, for two\nclasses of commercial aircraft: A 150 passenger (150PAX) plane and a 300 passenger\n(300PAX) plane. The engines that served as the models for these two classes of aircraft are\nthe CFM56-7 and the GE90. The engines were simulated and the analysis done with the\nNumerical Propulsion Simulation System (NPSS) computer code obtained from NASA Glenn\nResearch Center. NPSS incorporates the operating maps for the rotating components. To\nperform the analysis, the maps were decremented in efficiency to simulate component\ndegradation. In this manner, specific relations for the effect of particular component\ndegradation on overall engine performance was determined and compiled.\nThe problem of determining component degradation as a function of engine cycles was not\ncompleted. Though numerous models and experimental data are available in the open\nliterature for component degradation as a function of the particular parameters that affect\nefficiency, actual data to correlate component degradation a function of engine operating\ncycles was not found. A proprietary database was obtained of in-flight engine data that did\nprovide overall changes in certain engine operating parameters, most notably inter-stage\ntemperature of the low-pressure turbine (T4.9)., but specific mechanisms causing component\ndegradation could not be identified from this information. The database was, however, used\nto verify the 150PAX engine model by direct comparison of measured engine performance\nwith the NPSS simulation.\n\nIntegration of the OCAPP Universities (OSU)\nPropulsion 21 \xe2\x80\x93Phase II represents a unique cooperation between NASA, GE Aviation, a number\nof industries working with GE and five universities in the state of Ohio. GE coordinated the work\nof its industry partners. The Ohio State University, representing OCAPP, the Ohio Center for\nAdvanced Propulsion and Power, led the research activities at 5 key universities, i.e., The Ohio\nState University, the University of Cincinnati, the University of Dayton, the University of Akron and\nCase Western Reserve University.\nThe activities focused on the identification, integration and development of key propulsion\ntechnologies required to meet the objectives of future subsonic commercial power plants:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReduced Community Noise\nReduced Fuel Consumption\nImproved Thrust/Weight ratio\nLower Emissions\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942008-215226\n\n9\n\nEach technology described above was developed as a collaborative effort between one or more\nuniversities, NASA and the industry. The integration effort concentrated on 1) the development of\nanalytical tools to optimize propulsion systems and perform the tradeoffs necessary between the\ndifferent requirements, and 2) the work necessary to assure good collaboration and integration\nbetween the universities on individual technology developments.\nThe analytical tools used for the trade-off assessments were primarily NPSS (Numerical\nPropulsion System Simulation), WATE (Weight Analysis of Gas Turbine Engines) and FLOPS\n(Flight Optimization Systems).\nThe result of the studies indicates without any doubt the benefits of Intelligent Engines and\neventually Variable Cycle Engines. They indicate that high bypass turbofans are asked to operate\nat severe off-design conditions. For example, a propulsion system designed to maximize thrust,\nminimize temperature, noise and emissions at takeoff is being asked also to minimize fuel\nconsumption at altitude. Variable Cycles permit this in a more efficient manner.\nThe advent of VCE\xe2\x80\x99s permit the addition of a 3rd stream. For example, the flow in the outer duct\ncan be maximized at take-off for thrust and low noise while reduced at altitude for improved\npropulsion efficiency and good fuel consumption. These systems, which have been discussed in\nthe military in the supersonic field, are worth examining for subsonic transports as the cost of fuel\nis becoming a more important factor in the cost of operation.\nActive systems are of primary importance to optimize cycles as well as noise to minimize\nperformance losses and emissions with equivalent operability protection.\nThe integration between the different OCAPP universities has been rewarding, as it\ndemonstrated the benefits of cooperation and the use of multiple facilities to produce a first\nclass research consortium.\nPublications & Presentations\nC.A.
