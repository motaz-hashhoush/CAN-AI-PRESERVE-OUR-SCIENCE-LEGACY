Human factors research at Ames Research Center has produced two crew training programs directed toward more effective operations. Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) defines areas like decision making, workload distribution, communication skills, etc. as essential in addressing human error problems. In 1979, a workshop led to the implementation of the CRM program by United Airlines, and later other airlines. In Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT), crews fly missions in realistic simulators while instructors induce emergency situations requiring crew coordination. This is followed by a self critique. Ames Research Center continues its involvement with these programs.", "title": "Airline Crew Training", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020087647, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020087647, "id": "edea1152bbc2407a8972b714b5d417f1", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1989", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020087647.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020087647/downloads/20020087647.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020087647/downloads/20020087647.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020087647/downloads/20020087647.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
