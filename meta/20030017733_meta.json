By comparing traditional- and alternate-static-Figures of Merit (FOMs) with the Free-To-Roll (FTR) response data, a rational basis for assessing the merits of using standard testing techniques for the prediction of AWS events has been established. Using the FTR response data as a standard, since these results compare well with flight, the conclusion from this study is that neither traditional nor alternate FOMs can be trusted to provide an indication as to whether a configuration will or will not have AWS tendencies. Even though these FOMs may flag features which have a high degree of correlation with the FTR response data, there are as many or more of these FOM flagged features which do not correlate. Thus, one needs to use the FTR rig to assess AWS tendencies on new configurations.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030017733, "endDate": "2003-01-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "41st AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit", "location": "Reno, NV", "id": "22c1442f01274bd5ac4dc2639b7ac037", "startDate": "2003-01-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030017733, "id": "87052fe1395a483ca309ac58999c2051", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
