b'Wreless Communications\n\nA NASA\n\nindusty\nteam\nadapted\nSpace Shuttle\ntechnology to\nlocal area\nnetworking\n\nTo eliminate\nentanglement of freefloating cables in the\ncrew compartment of\nthe Space Shuttle\nOrbiter, Johnson Space\nCenter USC) developed a\nwireless infrared (IR)\nvoice communications\nsystem in which signals\nare impressed on IR light\nbeams and relayed\nthrough a series of\nboxes from one\nastronaut to another.\nFirst demonstrated on a\n1988 Shuttle flight, the\ntechnology may also f i d\napplication in\nmultichannel wireless\ncommunication for\nmission control and other ground support\noperations.\nSince such a system has obvious applicability in\nbusiness and industry, NASA sponsored a technology\nutilization project to adapt the technology to local\narea networking, in which large numbers of\nmicrocomputers are tied\n\n1\n\ncollaboration among\nJSC\'s Tracking and\nCommunications\nDivision; JSC\'s\nTechnology Utilization\nOfice; the NASA\nTechnology Application\nTeam at Research\nTriangle Institute (RTI),\nResearch Triangle Park,\nNorth Carolina; and\n\nWilton Industries, Danbury, Connecticut.\nJSC contributed its extensive systems engineering\nand design capability to assist in development of a\ncommercially viable wireless infrared data acquisition\nsystem. RTI served as liaison between JSC and\nWilton Industries and helped Wilton focus on a\nprimary commercial application; Wilton brought to\nthe project its proprietary infrared communications\ntechnology. Wilton was awarded a contract to\nprovide engineering design and fabrication of a\nprototype "cable eliminator" commercial system\nbased on JSC\'s wireless infrared communications\ntechnology. Now in production at Wilton Industries,\nthe commercial derivatives that emerged from the\ncollaboration provide the wireless equivalent of an\nRS232 link for industrial signal transmission and data\ncommunications applications.\nThe advantages of a cable-free system are\nevident in the industrial rule of thumb which\nestimates that the average cost of a foot of cable is\nonly one dollar, but the average cost of installing or\n\nI\n\ni\n\nWilton Industries provides IRplex 3000 series\nunits for extended area coverage requiring\ncontinuous communications between two\nequipments as they move over a large area that may\ninclude multiple large rooms. The extended area IR\nsystem consists of mobile transceivers which move\nunder the IR field of view of a number of ceiling\nmounted IR heads,\nor R/T Modules (at right\nis a ceiling mounted IR\nhead for use with the\nIRplex 6000 system). The\nIRplex Goo0 provides\nwireless local area\nnetwork coverage up to\n44,000 square feet and\ncan be connected to the\nEthernet, ARCNEP or\nToken Ring networks.\nAmong local area\nnetwork applications for\nwireless IR communications cited in a survey by\nTransaction Marketing, Inc., Greenwich, Connecticut,\nare stock exchange communications between floor\ntraders and their back offices; exposition/trade show\ncommunications; improved quality control through\nsampling data at loading/discharge points;\ntelepresence location of bar-coded parts in\ninventories or warehouses; improved process control\nthrough expanded measurement points, emergency\ncommunications in earthquake zone buildings; and\nvoice/data communications for "rovingnworkers,\nsuch as nurses, factory foremen and guards. Among\nWilton Industries\' initial commercial applications\nwere instrument panel testers at the Ford\nThunderbircUCougar assembly plant in Lorain, Ohio;\nwireless voice communications on the trim/paint\ninspection lines at a number of Ford\'s final assembly\nplants; and wireless RS232 data transfer systems for\nsubstation monitoring at Florida Power and Light.\n\n1\n\nRunning\n\nI\n\n@ARCNETis a registered trademark of Datapoint Corporation.\n\n@en\nimpractical\n\nI\n\nrelocating cable is $15 a foot - and therefore\nconnecting equipment in temporary installations\n(such as an industrial trade show) or installations\nlikely to change (such as office floor plans) can be\nexpensive. In addition, running cable is often\nimpractical in factories, as is cable connection for\ndata communications equipment in motion (such as\nportable computers).\nAt i le!ft, Wilton Industries president Jim\nk\nCrimmins works with a product designer on a new\nunit for the company\'s IRplex Wireless RS232 Cable\nEliminator line. At left center are some of the small\nand compact products of the Wilton line: clockwise\nfrom left, an IRplex 6000 hub and transceiver, an\nIRplex 1000 transceiver, and the IRplex 3100 unit.\nA substantial number of applications require the\nsimple wireless connection of two equipments\nwithout need for channel switching. For such\ninstallations, Wilton Industries offers the IRplex 1000\nSeries RS232 Cable Eliminator, which can, for\nexample, send data to a printer 200 feet away or\nreceive data from a remote data acquisition module.\nAn IR transceiver can be located anywhere that is\nconvenient because line-of-sight transmission is not\nnecessary; the IR pattern is omnidirectional, so the\nunit does not have to be pointed at another unit.
