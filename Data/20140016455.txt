The\ngovernment may have certain rights in the invention.\nTECHNICAL FIELD\nThe present invention relates to the motion control of a\nhumanoid robot, and more specifically an actuation system\nand packaging for an upper arm of the humanoid robot.\n\nand a spring output. The spring input is rotatably connected to\nan output of the gear drive and the spring output is connected\nto a joint output. The torsion spring is mounted within the\nsupport frame.\n5\nAn upper arm assembly for the humanoid robot includes a\nplurality of arm support frames each defining an axis. A\nplurality of rotary actuator assemblies are each mounted to\none of the plurality of arm support frames about the respective\naxes. Each rotary actuator assembly includes a motor, a gear\n10\ndrive rotatably connected to the motor, and a torsion spring.\nThe torsion spring has a spring input that is rotatably connected to an output of the gear drive and a spring output that\nis connected to an output for the actuator assembly.\n15 The above features and advantages and other features and\nadvantages of the present invention are readily apparent from\nthe following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the\naccompanying drawings.\n20\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n25\n\nRobots are automated devices that are able to manipulate\nobjects using a series of rigid links, which in turn are interconnected via articulations or motor-driven robotic joints.\nEach j oint in a typical robot represents an independent control\nvariable, also referred to as a degree of freedom (DOE).\nEnd-effectors are the particular links used for performing a\ntask at hand, e.g., grasping a work tool or an object. Therefore,\nprecise motion control of a robot may be organized by the\nlevel of task specification: object level control, i.e., the ability\nto control the behavior of an object held in a single or cooperative grasp of a robot, end-effector control, and joint level\ncontrol. Collectively, the various control levels cooperate to\nachieve the required robotic mobility, dexterity, and work\ntask-related functionality.\nHumanoid robots in particular are robots having an\napproximately human structure or appearance, whether a full\nbody, a torso, and/or an appendage, with the structural complexity of the humanoid robot being largely dependent upon\nthe nature of the work task being performed. The use of\nhumanoid robots may be preferred where direct interaction is\nrequired with devices or systems that are specifically made\nfor human use. Due to the wide spectrum of work tasks that\nmay be expected of a humanoid robot, different control\nmodes may be simultaneously required. For example, precise\ncontrol must be applied within the different spaces noted\nabove, as well control over the applied torque or force,\nmotion, and the various grasp types.\nIn order to approximate human movement each joint\nwithin the robot requires at least one actuator for each DOE\nAdditionally, these actuators must be packaged in an arrangement that approximately represents human structure and\nappearance.\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED\nEMBODIMENT\n45\n\n5o\n\n55\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n60\n\nAccordingly, rotary actuator assembly is provided herein\nfor actuation of an upper arm assembly for a dexterous\nhumanoid robot. The rotary actuator assembly includes a\nsupport frame defining an axis and a motor mounted about the\naxis within the support frame. A gear drive is rotatably connected to the motor and is also mounted within the support\nframe about the axis.
