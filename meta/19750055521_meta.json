There is no evidence for the pyroclastic origin of the dark mantle. It is found that the North Massif soils contain a  large amount of mare-derived fragments being transported horizontally from the basaltic valley floor. A light mantle deposit of uniform composition including comminuted noritic and anorthositic breccia is observed. It is suggested that the light mantle is an avalanche deposit from regolith developed high on the South Massif.", "title": "Petrography of Apollo 17 soils", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T04:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750055521, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Heiken, G."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "b4af2da6aefa4ffbb5f97ea272cb6dcf"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19750055521, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mckay, D.
