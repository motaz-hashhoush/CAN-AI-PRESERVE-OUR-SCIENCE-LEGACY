The Solar Cooling System was installed in a hotel at St. Thomas, U. S. Virgin Islands. The system consists of the evacuated glass tube collectors, two 2500 gallon tanks, pumps, computerized controller, a large solar optimized industrial sized lithium bromide absorption chiller, and associated plumbing. Solar heated water is pumped through the system to the designed public areas such as lobby, lounges, restaurant and hallways. Auxiliary heat is provided by steam and a heat exchanger to supplement the solar heat.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810025068, "id": "fdcc2cad4755480a841ffe6ccb7fc219", "publicationDate": "1981-09-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19810025068.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19810025068/downloads/19810025068.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19810025068/downloads/19810025068.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19810025068/downloads/19810025068.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
