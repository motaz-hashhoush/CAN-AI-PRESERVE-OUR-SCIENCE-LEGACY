It is noted that the array was unique in that: (1) major weight concessions were made to produce a dynamically stiff array; (2) it was the first array designed to be compatible with the NASA Multimission Modular Spacecraft; (3) it is the first jettisonable solar array; and (4) it represents the first use of FEP-bonded overslides on a prime power array. It is concluded that the array performed as predicted with no evidence of the FEP causing any unusual array power degradations. In addition, the deployment and telemetry systems performed as designed.", "title": "Solar array system for solar maximum mission", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T01:59:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840040186, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Meese, R.
