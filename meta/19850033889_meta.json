Using the composite mechanics theories for thermomechanical behavior embodied in the ICAN (Integrated Composites Analyzer) computer code, select composite thermal and mechanical properties are predicted and also their response to cryogenic temperatures, resembling those which occur in space applications. The predicted results are presented in graphical form as a function of the composite's laminate configuration, fiber volume ratio and the selected use temperature. These results are suitable for preliminary design purposes only and should serve as an aid in selecting controlled experiments for obtaining corresponding measured data.", "title": "Select fiber composites for space applications - A mechanistic assessment", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T09:54:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850033889, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ginty, C.
