The ATLAS space shuttle missions were conducted\nin March 1992, April 1993, and November 1994. The ATLAS\npayload and companion instruments made measurements of\nsolar irradiance and middle atmospheric temperatures and trace\ngas concentrations. The solar irradiance measurements\nincluded total and spectrally resolved solar irradiance. The\natmospheric measurements included microwave, infrared, and\nultraviolet limb sounding, nadir ultraviolet backscatter, and\nsolar occultation techniques. This paper introduces a special\nsection in this issue of Geophysical Research Letters.\n\nIntroduction\nThe Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science\n(ATLAS) was a series of three Spacelab missions flown in\n1992, 1993, and 1994 with three major purposes: (I) determination of highly accurate and precise information about the\ntrace chemical composition of the Earth\'s middle and upper\natmosphere and incident solar radiation for comparison with\ninformation from other space-based instruments measuring\nthese quantities; (2) measurement of a range of atmospheric\nand solar parameters such that very detailed scientific studies\non atmospheric composition could be carried out for the brief\nduration of a flight of the space shuttle (8-1 1 days); and (3)\nprovision of space-flight opportunities for instruments with\nobjectives compatible to those of the ATLAS instruments so\nthat comparisons of their measurements with those of the\nATLAS instruments could be done as well as complementary\nscience between two or more instruments. Originally envisioned as a series of 10 missions over an 1I-year solar cycle,\nthe ATLAS series was truncated after three missions due to a\ncombination of funding constraints and limited availability of\nthe space shuttle with a reduced flight rate and increased\ndemands on the shuttle for other activities.\nA major focus of the ATLAS series has been on the accuracy\nand precision of the measurements made. The simultaneous\nmeasurements of an identical parameter by different instruments allows to assess absolute accuracy, noise level, and\nefficiency of method of retrieval. This strategy is not unique,\nbeing similar to that of the Upper Atmosphere Research\nSatellite (UARS) [Reber, 19931. Unlike instruments flown on\nfree-flying satellites, however, instruments flown on the\nspace shuttle are brought back to Earth, so that for each measurement both pre- and post-flight calibrations can be carried\nout, along with any on-board calibration activities conducted\nover the course of the shuttle missions. Combining this calibration regimen with the short-duration flights that limit onorbit instrument degradation should allow the ATLAS meaThis paper is not subject to U.S. copyright.

Summaries of the individual ATLAS\nmissions have already appeared [Torr, 1993; Miller et al.,\n1993; Miller et al., 19951. The present overview article summarizes the three ATLAS missions, including the differences\namong them, and serves as an introduction of the 33 papers\npresenting results from the instruments which flew aboard\nthese missions.\nThe ATLAS core instrument package consisted of six\ninstruments, which are briefly described in Table 1. Two are\nfor atmospheric chemistry measurements (ATMOS and MAS),\ntwo are for measurements of spectrally resolved solar radiation\n(SOLSPEC and SUSIM), and two are for measurements of total\nsolar irradiance (ACRIM and SOLCON). With the exception of\nMAS, all of these instruments flew on the space shuttle prior\nto the ATLAS series-ACRIM, SOLCON, and SOLSPEC aboard\nthe Spacelab-1 mission in 1983, SUSIM aboard the Spacelab2 mission in 1985 (as well as the earlier OSS-I in 1982), and\nATMOS aboard the Spacelab-3 mission in 1985. Flying along\nwith the ATLAS payload on all three missions was the SSBUV\ninstrument, which has now flown a total of eight times aboard\nthe space shuttle. Other instruments have accompanied the\nATLAS instruments as well, including several atmospheric\nscience, space physics, and astronomy instruments which flew\naboard ATLAS-I as part of a reflight of much of the Spacelab-1\npackage and a student-run solar instrument from the University\nof Colorado (ESCAPE) which flew aboard ATLAS-2 and\nATLAS-3. Co-manifested payloads deployed and retrieved from\nthe space shuttle which accompanied the ATLAS missions\nwere the SPARTAN-201 solar science package [Fisher and\nGuhathakurta, 19951 aboard ATLAS-2 and the German Shuttle\nPallet Satellite (SPAS) platform which carried the CRISTA and\nMAHRSI atmospheric science instruments (see Table 1) aboard\nATLAS-3 [Offermann and Conway, 19953.\nA variety of "correlative measurement opportunities" were\nidentified for the ATLAS instruments. Most notable among\nthese is NASA\'s Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite\n(UARS), launched in September 1991. There is a great deal of\ncomplementarity between the UARS and ATLAS payloads,\nincluding each having two near-twin instruments (ACRIM and\nSUSIM), as well as instruments with very similar measurement\nobjectives and experimental techniques (e.g., infrared absorption by occultation and microwave emission spectrometry).\nSignificant attention has been paid to correlative measurement\nopportunities between the ATLAS and UARS payloads\n[Harrison et al., 1992; 1993; 19951, and ATLAS data have\n\n~\n\n2286\n\nKAYE AND MILLER: THE ATLAS SERIES OF SHUlTLE MISSIONS\n\nTable 1 ATLAS Instruments\n.\nInstrument\nActive Cavity Radiometer Irradiance\nMonitor (ACRIM)\nSolar Constant (SOLCON)\nSolar Spectrum (SOLSPEC)\nSolar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance\nMonitor (SUSIM)\nAtmospheric Trace Molecule\nSpectroscopy (ATMOS)\nMillimeter-Wave Atmospheric Sounder\n(MAS)\nShuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet\n(SSBUV)\nCryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and\nTelescopes for the Atmosphere\n(CRISTA)*\nMiddle Atmosphere High Resolution\nSpectrometric Investigation\n(MAHRSI)*\nExperiment of the Sun for\nComplementing the ATLAS Payload\nand for Education (ESCAPE)**\n\nType\n\nInstitution\n\nTotal solar irradiance\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nTotal solar irradiance\nSolar spectrum, IR through UV\nSolar UV output\n\nInstitut Royal Meteorologique Belgium\nCNRS France\nNaval Research Laboratory\n\nMiddle atmosphere chemistry\n(solar absorption)\nMiddle atmosphere chemistry\n(mm-wave emissions)\nStratospheric ozone (UV backscatter)\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nMiddle atmosphere chemistry\n(IR emissions)\n\nUniversity of Wuppertal (Germany)\n\nMiddle atmosphere OH, N\nO\n(UV solar fluorescence)\n\nNaval Research Laboratory\n\nSolar far-UV output\n\nUniversity of Colorado\n\nMax Planck Institute of Aeronomy\n(Germany)\nNASAIGoddard Space Flight Center\n\n*CRISTA and MAHRSI flew with ATLAS-3 only.\n**ESCAPE, a student experiment, flew with ATLAS-2 and ATLAS-3.\nbeen used extensively in UARS validation [Grose and Gille,\n1995; Woods et al., 1996; Gille et al., 19961. SSBUV plays a\ncritical role in the validation of the ozone and solar spectral\nirradiance measurements of the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet/2\n(SBUVl2) instruments aboard NOAA\'s polar-orbiting operational meteorological satellites [Hilsenrath et al., 19951.\nOther correlative measurement opportunities included solar\nflux measurements on the European Retrieval Carrier\n(EURECA) and the Earth Radiaion Budget Satellite (ERBS), and\nozone measurements from the Total Ozone Mapping\nSpectrometer (TOMS) instruments on Nimbus-7 and Meteor\nsatellites.\nThe two total solar irradiance instruments in the ATLAS\npayload, SOLCON and ACRIM, are both pyrheliometers, measuring the amount of energy absorbed in a cavity exposed to\nsunlight. The total solar irradiance ("solar constant") was\nmeasured to within 0.1% accuracy and precision\n[Crommelynck et al., this issue]. In the context of a larger\nprogram with many measurements on several platforms over a\nlong period of time, as well as instruments on long-duration,\nfree-flying platforms, such as the UARS ACRIM instrument,\nthis accuracy on periodic short missions can help establish\nour knowledge of possible variations in the total solar energy\nthat drives Earth\'s climate system.\nThe two spectrally resolved solar irradiance instruments,\nSOLSPEC and SUSIM, covered different wavelength ranges,\nwith SOLSPEC covering from the ultraviolet (UV) to near\ninfrared wavelengths, while SUSIM examined only UV wavelengths but down to a short-wavelength cutoff of 110 nm.\nSSBUV, whose primary purpose is to measure the vertical profile of stratospheric ozone, also made measurements of solar\nUV radiation [Cebula et al., this issue]. The ESCAPE instrument was designed to make measurements in the far UV,\nextending the ATLAS measurement range to wavelengths\nbelow the SUSIM short-wavelength cutoff.\nA large number of atmospheric trace constituents and temperatures were measured using several methods (see Table 2).\n\nThe MAS instrument [Hartmann et al., this issue] measured\naltitude profiles of the emissions of atmospheric radiation in\nthe millimeter wave range, specifically at frequencies corresponding to water vapor, ozone, chlorine monoxide, and\nmolecular oxygen (used for temperature and pressure). ATMOS\nmeasured the absorption of infrared solar radiation by the\nEarth\'s atmosphere and from those data the concentrations of a\nvery large number of trace species can be inferred as a function\nof altitude [Gunson et al., this issue]. SSBUV measured the\nscattering of solar UV radiation from the Earth\'s atmosphere,\nand used this information to obtain both total column ozone\nand ozone vertical profile distributions, as well as nitric oxide\namounts in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. CRISTA\nmeasured emissions of infrared radiation in three viewing\ndirections, obtaining detailed three-dimensional datasets of\nvarious trace gases. MAHRSI made limb scanning\nmeasurements of the UV solar resonance fluorescence of OH\nand NO to obtain their vertical density profiles in the middle\natmosphere (Conway et al., 1996).\nAll three ATLAS missions were carried out with an orbital\ninclination of 57 degrees, allowing the viewing of most of the\nEarth\'s surface. The orbit altitudes of ATLAS-1 and ATLAS-2\nwere both 296 km, and the altitude of ATLAS-3 was slightly\nhigher (302 km). Because of the emphasis on highly accurate\nand precise measurements, significant attention was placed on\nconsideration of contamination issues. In addition to the\ncleanliness requirements on the individual instruments and\nSpacelab pallet, a special wipe-down of the shuttle payload\nbay was used prior to the ATLAS-2 and ATLAS-3 missions.\nThe solar instruments did not operate until the platform had\nbeen in orbit for some 24 hours to allow for outgassing of any\ncontaminants.\nDue to different launch times and seasons, the viewing\nregions and times of the ATLAS instruments differed from one\nmission to the next. This was particularly true for ATMOS, as\nit uses the occultation technique, and the position of the occultations is very sensitive to launch time.

The ATLAS-2 and\nATLAS-3 missions took place during the northern and southern hemisphere spring seasons, respectively, during which the\n\ncorresponding polar vortices persisted (displaced somewhat\nfrom the pole), allowing for observations both inside and outside. More details on the meteorological conditions of the\nATLAS-3 mission are summarized in a paper by Manney et al.\n(this issue).\nSince instrument pointing was provided by the space shMtle, atmospheric and solar observations were carried out\nsequentially.

During solar observations, the orbiter\nchanged orientations every orbit between the cargo bay pointing towards the S u n (day side) to pointing toward deep space\nfor cooling (night side). Scientific observations were suspended during the deployment and retrieval of the SPARTAN\n201 (ATLAS-2) and CRISTAJSPAS (ATLAS-3) carriers. There\nwere also several short periods of time during the latter mission when scientific observations by the ATLAS instruments\nwere halted s o that the shuttle attitude was changed t o o n e\ndedicated to communications with the SPAS.\nAll instruments performed well during the ATLAS missions,\nwith the exception of the M A S instrument, which failed after 1\nday of operations during ATLAS-3. However, M A S was still\nable to obtain near-global measurements of H 2 0 , 0 3 , C10, and\ntemperature during that period [Hartmann et al., this issue].\nThe 2.5-year time interval between the first and last ATLAS\nmissions saw several interesting and important changes in the\natmosphere and solar forcing: ( I ) T h e r e was a significant\ndecrease in the stratospheric aerosol burden (see Fig. 1) over\nthis time period, since the ATLAS-] mission occurred only 9\nmonths after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption (June 1991) and only a\nfew months after the peak in total stratospheric aerosol abundance a s inferred from the Stratospheric Aerosol and G a s\nExperiment (SAGE). Given that there is an approximate I-year\nlifetime f o r stratospheric aerosols, o n e s e e s that t h e\nstratospheric aerosol loading decayed by nearly a factor of 100\nfrom the ATLAS-I to ATLAS-3 mission. This decay allowed\nfor significantly improved penetration of A T M O S occultations into the lower stratosphere and troposphere in ATLAS-3\na s opposed to ATLAS-1 when most occultations could not\nobserve the lower stratosphere (but interesting studies could\nbe carried out o n the aerosol optical properties [Rinsland et\nal., 19941; (2) T h e r e was a marked decline in global total\nozone in the 1992-1993 time period believed to b e related t o\nthe Mt. Pinatubo eruption. This decline was just beginning at\nthe time of the ATLAS-] flight, was near its maximum at the\ntime of the ATLAS-2 flight, and was essentially recovered by\nthe ATLAS-3 flight.

T h e ATLAS-I and ATLAS-2 flights were during the\ndeclining phase o f solar cycle 22, while ATLAS-3 was very\nclose to solar minimum. It is also worth noting that the\nhalogen burden in the stratosphere continued to increase over\nthis time period [Gunson et al., this issue].\nAcknowledgments.

The SOLSPEC, SSBW, and SUSIM spectrometers\nsimultaneously observed the solar spectral irradiance during the\nATLAS1 mission flown on board the Space Shuffle Atlantis in March\n1992. The three instruments use different methods and means of\nabsolute calibration and were each calibrated preflight and postflight.\nThe three data sets are reported from 200 to 350 nm at 1.1 nm\nresolution. The method of comparing the three independent data sets\nis discussed. The importance of a common, precise wavelength scale\nis shown when comparing the data in wavelength regions of strong\nFraunhofer lines. The agreement among the solar irradiance\nmeasurements is better than t5%. The fact that the calibrations of the\nthree instrumentswere based on three independent standards provides\nconfidence that the absolute solar spectral irradiance in the range\n200-350 nm is now known with an accuracy better than t5%. The\nmean ATLAS-1 solar spectrum is compared with simultaneous solar\nobservations from the UARS SOLSTICE and UARS SUSIM\ninstruments. The two mean solar spectra agree to within t3%.\n\nIntroduction\nSolar spectral irradiance data and its changes, particularly in the\nmiddle and near ultraviolet (UV) are needed for photochemical studies\nand understanding the thermal structure, dynamics, and energy budget\nof the earth\'s atmosphere. As a result of molecular and aerosol\nscattering and, to a lesser extent, absorption by trace gases,\napproximately 50% of the extraterrestrial irradiance in the region\nbetween 300 and 400 nm reaches the Earth\'s surface. Shortward of\n300 nm the solar irradiance is strongly absorbed by ozone and\nmolecular oxygen. Tracking solar irradiance changes at these\nwavelengths can therefore best be done above the Earth\'s atmosphere.\nThe Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite (UARS) and the ATLAS\nSpace Shuffle missions each carried multiple instruments to measure\nthe extraterrestrial solar irradiance. The two spacecrafls\' instruments\ncomplemented each other in that the UARS instruments were\ndesigned to monitor the sun over time, while the ATLAS instruments\nwere designed to perform periodic checks of the UARS (and other\nsatellite) instruments each time an ATLAS mission was conducted.\nIn this paper we compare simultaneous ATLAS-I solar spectral\nirradiance observations from the Solar Spectrum (SOLSPEC), the\n\'Hughes STX Corporation, Greenbelt, MD 20770\n\'Service dtAeronomiedu CNRS, Verrieres le Buisson, France 91371\n\'Naval Research Laboratory, Washington,DC 20375-5352\n4NASAIGodd~d\nSpace Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771\nW t dqAeronomie\nt\nu\nSpatialede Belgique, B1180 Bruxelles, Belgium\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GLO 1109\n0094-8534196196GL-0 1 109$05.00\n\nShuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBW), and the Solar\nUltraviolet SpectralIrradiance Monitor (SUSIM) instruments obtained\non 29 March 1992. The three ATLAS instruments\' solar spectral\nirradiance measurements are first compared to one another and then\nthe average of the ATLAS data is compared to simdtaneous data\ntaken by the UARS Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment\n(SOLSTICE) and UARS SUSIM instruments [Rotbnan et aL, 1993;\nBruecher et aL, 19931. This paper complements the results given by\nWoods et al. [1996], where the UARS solar irradiance data are\nvalidated by direct comparison and by using S S B W and SUSIM data\nfrom ATLAS-1 and -2.\nObserving the sun in the W is complicated by instrument\ndegradation caused by the damaging space environment and the\ndifficulty in achieving an accurate absolute calibration. In earlier\ncomparisons [Heath, 1980; Mount and Rotbnan, 1985; Nicolet,\n1989; Lean, 19911, differences among the measurements were as\nlarge as 20% in the middle W. It is now well known that both solar\nrotation and solar cycle variability are significantly lower, typically 79% at 200 nm, and, except for isolated absorption features, decrease\nwith increasing wavelength [Lean, 19911. The accuracy of solar\nirradiance measurements has significantly improved during the last\ntwo decades. We are now at the point at which the accuracies of the\nprimary standards are no longer negligible with respect to other\nsources of measurement uncertainty. A unique aspect of the solar\nobservations reported here is that the three spectrometers have\ndifferent designs, are calibrated with different methods, and employ\nthree different absolute standards. This comparison therefore can\ndetermine if the measured absolute irradiance data are consistent. If\nso, then the absolute value of solar spectral irradiance in the middle\nW can be established with much improved confidence.\n\nSOLSPEC\nThe Shuttle SOLSPEC instrument first flew in 1983 on the\nSpacelab-1 mission [Labs et al., 19871 and has since flown on the\nthree ATLAS missions. A companion SOLSPEC experiment also\nflew on the European Space Agency\'s EURECA platform from\nAugust 1992 to May 1993. The instrument was described by\nThuillier et al. [1981]. SOLSPEC observes from 200 to 3000 nm\nusing three similar double monochromators. The W spectrometer\n(200-350 nm) has 1.l nm bandpass, steps in 0.4 nm increments, and\nits wavelength positioning, determined from metrology of the grating\ndrive mechanism, is about k0.01 nm. SOLSPEC incorporates\ndiffusers in front of each entrance slit to minimize the impact of any\npointing offset. The W spectrometer uses a photomultiplier tube\n(FMT) as its detector. The experiment includes calibration lamps to\nmonitor the responsivity and the spectral characteristics of the optics\nin space and on the ground. Two deuterium @ lamps were\n,\n)\nperiodically activated to check the spectrometer\'s radiometric\nsensitivity. Seven emission lines from a Cu-He hollow cathode lamp\nwere used to monitor the wavelength scale and the instrument slit\nfunction. For the 28 spectra used to construct the mean SOLSPEC\n\nCEBULA ET AL.: ATLAS-1 OBSERVATIONSOF THE W SOLAR IRRADIANCE\nspectrum, the stability of the wavelength scale, determined using the\n280 nm M 1 line profile, was found to be H.02 nm.\ng1\nThe Heidelberg Observatory blackbody is used as the irradiance\nsource for the SOLSPEC radiometric calibration. The windowless\nblackbdy is heated to appwdmately 3050 K and its temperature is\nmeasured periodically using a pyrometer with an muracy of +6 K,\nincludingthe pyrometer calibration error. The blackbody\'s irradiance\nis calculated using Planck\'s law and the instrument\'s responsivity\ndetermined fram the instrument counts recorded when observing the\ncavity under the same solid angle as is used to view the sun. The\nestimated 30 uncertainty of the SOLSPEC radiometric calibration\ndecnasesfiom 24.3% at 200 nm to 23.3% at 250 nm and 22.4% 350\nnm. The SOLSPECwavelength calibration was determined via a least\nsquares regression of the observed positions of lines from argon,\nkrypton, and neon laboratory sources and the internal Cu-He lamp to\na second order polynomial dispersion equation. The 20 uncertainty\nin the absolute wavelength calibration of SOLSPEC is fl.1 nm.\nDetails of the SOLSPEC ATLAS-1 calibration procedures, data\npraxssing, and analysis are discussed by Thuillier et al. [Observation\nof the W solar spectral irradiance between 200 and 360 nm during\nthe ATLAS 1 mission by the SOLSPEC spectrometer, submitted to\nSolarPhysics]. The mean SOLSPEC solar spectrum for March 29 is\nshown as the blue curve in Fig. 1. The standard deviation of the 28\nspectral scan mean was +I%. The final uncertainty in the derived\nSOLSPEC irradiance, including the accuracy of the radiometric\ncalibration and precision of the solar measurements, ranges from\n24.5% at 200 nm to 23.4% at 250 nm and 22.5% at 350 nm.\n\nSSBUV\nSSBW supportsthe long-term global stratospheric ozone and solar\nW monitoring programs by providing repeated checks on the\ncalibrationsof W ozone and solar monitoring instruments flying on\nUS and international satellites. These include the Nimbus-7 S B W\nand Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments, the\nMeteor TOMS instrument, and the SBUVf2 instruments on NOAA-9,\n-11, and -14. SSBUV flew 8 times between October 1989 and\nJanuary 1996; the ATLAS-1 mission was the fourth S S B W flight.\nThe instrument consists of a double holographic grating speotrometer\nwith a PMT detector. The S S B W wavelength range is 200 to 405\n\nnm and the bandpass is 1.1 nm. The instrument is identical to the\nSBWnsatellite instruments except that SSBUV uses a transmission\nrather than the reflection solar diffuser used on the satellite\ninstruments. An onboard calibration system uses quartz halogen, Dl,\nand mercury lamps to monitor the instrument radiometric sensitivity\nand wavelength registration. S S B W solar irradiance observations\nfrom the first four missions were reported by Cebula et al. [1994].\nThe S S B W calibration approach and results were described by\nCebula et al. [I9891 and Hilsenrath et al. [1991, 19931. Multiple\ntungsten quartz halogen (FEL) secondary standard lamps, calibrated\nby the National Institutefor Standards and Technology (NIST), are the\nprimary standardsused to calibrate S S B W between 250 and 405 nm.\nThe FEL calibrations are traceable to a NIST gold point blackbody\n[Walker et al., 19871. NIST-calibrated D2 arc lamps also provide\ncalibration data in the 250-350 nm region and are used to extend the\nSSBW calibration to 200 nm. The Dl measurementsare normalized\nto the FEL data in the spectral overlap region [Cebulaet al., 19891.\nThe wavelength calibration of S S B W as a function of the grating\nencoder stepnumber is determined via a least squares regression of the\nobserved position of lines from multiple laboratory sources. The\nestimated 20 uncertainty of this calibration is fP.02 to 50.03 nm.\nDuring each mission the stability of the S S B W wavelength\ncalibration is monitored using the onboard Hg lamp and 13 solar\nabsorptionfeatures. Over the first 6 flights, long-term changes in the\nSSBUV wavelength calibration were less than fP.02 nm and\nthermally driven intratlight changes were 0.05 nm or less [Cebulaet\nal., 19961. The S S B W solar data were corrected for these changes.\nSSBW o k e d the sun during 4 solar observation periods on 29\nMarch 1992. Each solar observation consisted of 6 to 8 complete\nspectral scans of the sun. The arithmetic mean of all scans for each\nsolar observation period was first computed. The arithmetic mean of\nthe mean solar irradiance measured during the second, third, and\nfourth of the March 29 S S B W solar observation periods, shown as\nthe red curve in Fig. 1, was then computed. Data from the first solar\nobservation period were excluded in order to ensure that the\ninsbument had filly stabilized. The S S B W solar data were corrected\nfor a small amount of degradation which occurred during flight. The\nestimated 20 uncertainty in the S S B W solar irradiance ranges from\n+2.4% near 350 nm to +6% near 200 nm [Woods et al., 19961.\n-\n\nSUSIM\n1 0 0 0 0 ~ " " " " \' " " \' ~\n\n-\n\n29 MARCH 1992\n\nL\n\nmmw\nSUSlM\n\n1\n\n200\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-\n\nI\n\n-\n\n.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\'\n\n.\n\n250\n300\nWAVELENGTH [NM]\n\n\'\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\'\n\n350\n\nFigme 1 The average SOLSPEC (bule), S S B W (red), and SUSIM\n.\n(green) ATLAS-1 solar irradiance measured on 29 March 1992, each\npresented at 1.1 nm resolution.\n\nThe Shuffle SUSIM instrument [VanHoosier et al., 19881 consists\nof two identical doubledispemionscanning speotrometerswhich cover\nthe wavelength range 110420 nm with both 0.15 nm and 5.0 nm\nresolution, which is controlled by changeable slits. The instrument\nflew five times between March 1982 and November 1994 on OSS-1,\nSpacelab, and three ATLAS missions. The Shuttle instrument is the\nprecursor and similar to the UARS SUSIM instrument flying on the\nUARS satellite [Brueclmer et al., 19931. In-flight sensitivity changes\nare tracked by using one of the two spectrometers only to view an\nonboard Dl calibration lamp in order to characterize changes in the\nfilters and detectors. The second spectrometer is used to make solar\nmeasurements and to periodically make D2 lamp scans to compare\nwith the calibration spectrometer to determine sensitivity changes.\nThe 5 nm resolution is used for the highest accuracy using photodiode\ndetectors, while the 0.15 nm resolution uses PMTs.\nThe calibration standard for the SUSIM is the NIST Synchrotron\nUltraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF), which is a primary standard\n[Saloman etaL, 19821. The SURF beam irradiance is determined by\nsynchrotron theory. During calibration SUSIM is oriented at 45" and\n135" to the plane of the synchrotron; the average of the calibration\nfactors for these two orientationsremoves almost all the effats of the\npolarization of the SURF beam. Longward of 250 nm the SUSIM\ncalibration is validated using a NIST-calibrated FEL lamp. The two\nindependent calibrations, SURF and FEL, agree to within 2%. An\naging correction to account for SUSIM inflight degradation (4% or\n\nCEBULA ET AL ATLAS-1 OBSERVATIONS OF THE IJV SOLAR\n\nless betrveen 200 and 350 nm) was based on a comparison of the\nin\ncalibrations The total 2 5 uncerta~nty the\npreflight and\nSUSIM absolute calibration, including uncertainties in the SURF\nirradiance, polarization effects, and instrument degradation during the\ncallbration, is est~rnated be 24% [ f i o d s et a [ , 19961.\nto\nThe wavelength scale for the high resolution SUSIM spectrum was\nderived by a second order polynomial fit to 11 well defined solar\nspectral lines across the range of the grating encoder positions. These\n11 wavelengths were determined by convolving high resolution\nspectra [Moe et al., 1976; Anderson and Hall, 1989; Kurucz et al.,\n19841 to the 0.15 nm resolution of the SUSIM instrument.\nInstrument power was cycled several times during ATLAS-1, which\nnecessitated resetting the grating encoder and determining new\nwavelength coefficients. This made wavelength tracking difficult.\nThe SUSIM wavelength calibration has an estimated 2 0 uncertainty\nof no worse than 9 . 4 nm.\nThe SUSIM solar spectral irradiance used for this comparison,\nshown as the green curve in Fig. I , consists of the mean of 2 spectra\ntaken during a 3 orbit period on March 29. This spectrum was\ncomputed via a convolution of the observed 0.1 5 nm spectra with a\n1.1 nrn FWHM triangular slit function in order to match the resolution\nof other two instruments. The total 2 0 uncertainty in the mean\nSUSIM solar irradiance ranges from 25% to 28% from 200-350 nm.\nThe larger uncertainty applies only in those areas where the solar\nspectrum is steep and uncertainty in the wavelength registration of the\ncalibration and solar data dominates.\n\nWavelength scale impact\nEach experiment team applied a detailed wavelength calibration to\ntheir data. However, small differences in the wavelength assigned to\neach instrument\'s solar spectrum can have a dramatic effect when\nspectra are compared. Particular challenges occur near the nmerous\nas legions where the \'Pectrum makes\nlines, as\nlarge changes in magnitude, for\nthe edge\n208 nm\'\nEach instrument has a slightly different bandpass width and\nfurther\nsensitivity to\nerror,\nhas a\ngaussian shape while the SSBUV and SUSIM slit functions are nearly\ntriangular. Among the techniques used by the experiment teams to\nestablish accurate wavelength scales for their spectra are comparison\nto high resolution spectra [Anderson and Hall, 1989; Kurucz et al.,\n19841, which can be determined with higher wavelength accuracy.\nThe high resolution data were first convolved with each of the ATLAS\ninstruments\' slit functions, then the resulting spectra were compared\nto the ATLAS instruments\' spectra in 10 nm intervals over the entire\nspectral region from 200 nm to 350 nm For each instrument the\ncomparison typically exhibited some scatter with respect to the high\nresolution data, but no errors greater than 20.1 nm were revealed,\nhence no adjustments were made. However, a t 0 . 1 nm wavelength\nshift between the spectra can generate differences of about +5%,\nwhich is comparable to the structure observed in the comparisons\npresented later in this paper.\n\n2291\n\nLANCE\n\nThe result of this procedure IS shown as the solid lines in Fig. 2. While\nthese latter curves show generally good agreement w~thineach\ninstrument\'s calibration uncertainties, two types of features as a\nfunction of wavelength are observed. First, despite the integration\nover 5 nm, the presence of strong Fraunhofer lines, such as the Mg II\nline at 280 nm, remains noticeable. Deep lines can generate\ndiscrepancies which extend over several nanometers due to the\nrunning mean integration effect. Second, variations over tens of\nnanometers, particularly evident between 240 and 280 nm, are likely\ndue to radiometric calibration errors. Here the differences with\nrespect to the ATLAS-1 mean spectrum are approximately -5% for\nSOLSPEC and +5% for SUSIM, with S S B W lying roughly midway\nbetween the other two instruments. This implies an approximate 10%\nrelative difference between SOLSPEC and SUSIM in this spectral\nregion. Taking into account the uncertainty in the two instruments, it\nappears this d8erence is real and may be due to a discrepancy in their\nrelative calibrations. At other wavelengths the agreement among the\nthree instrumentsimproves by approximately a factor of two over that\nseen between 240 and 280 nm. The data presented in Fig. 2\ndemonstrate the difficulties in measuring the solar irradiance in the\nmiddle UV. While at first it might appear that the S S B W data\napproximately replicate the mean ATLAS-1 spectrum, this is not the\ncase. The SSBUV irradiances are approximately 2% greater than the\nmean ATLAS-1 irradiance in the region between 290 and 320 nm and\nare thus approximately 3% higher than the average of the SOLSPEC\nand SUSIM irradiances in this interval. Future comparisons of\nATLAS-2 and ATLAS-3 data will help identify the source(s) of the\ndifferences observed in Fig. 2.\nA unique feature of this comparison is that each of the three\ninstruments traces its calibration to an independent calibration\nstandard: the Heidelberg blackbody for SOLSPEC, EEL lamps for\nSSBW, and SURF for SUSIM, Hence, the differencesshown in Fig.\ncan arise from errors in correctingfor instrument aging during the\nmission, from errors in transferring the absolute calibrations from the\nlaboratory standards to the instruments, and from fundamental\nradiometric digerences between the irradiance scales of the laboratory\nThe three ATLAS instruments participated in a\nNIST-coordinated Round Robin [Foods et\n19961, which\ncompared calibration standards and laboratory procedures.

The solar constant observations obtained by the\nSOLCONIATLAS experiment during the three successive\nmissions are presented based on the Space Absolute Radiometric\nReference (SARR) defined during the ATLAS-2 mission. The\nobjectives of SOLCON, namely to obtain accurate measurements\nof the solar constant and to compare them with the observations\nobtained from free flyers in the hope of establishing a baseline\nand strategy for monitoring the solar constant at climate scale,\nhave been achieved successfully with the three ATLAS missions.\nThe long range objective of insuring the solar constant data\ncontinuity will, however, require that an alternative approach than\nthat of the ATLAS program be found to fly and retrieve\nSOLCON.\n\nIntroduction\nThe following results were obtained by the Belgian experiment\nSOLCON flown with the ATLASDTASA program. SOLCON is\npart of the core payload of the ATLAS program. Its scientific\nobjective is to measure the solar constant during each of the solar\nobsemation periods of each ATLAS mission. The solar constant\nis defined as the total radiated flux from the sun, on a square\nmeter area, at the mean sun to Earth distance. In the context of\npotential "global climate change", it is well recognized that the\nknowledge of the long term behavior of the solar constant is of\nbasic importance.\nTo obtain this knowledge, it is necessary that measurements be\nperformed continuously with the highest feasible absolute\naccuracy. However, solar irradiance continuous and drift free\nmeasurements can not be really guaranteed on a long term basis\ndue to possible program budget problems and the susceptibility of\nthe experiment to aging in space.\nTherefore, the rational strategy to follow is regular, if not\nperiodic, comparisons of the observations obtained from free\nflyers with those from retrieved absolute radiometers like\nSOLCON and SOVA 1, which carry the Space Absolute\nRadiometric Reference (SARR) heritage. This is what has been\ndone with the ATLAS missions from the space shuttle.\n\nThe SOLCON Instrument\n~h~ mass of the SOLCON experiment is 9,962 kg. ~ t power\ns\nconsumption is 13.6 W and its data rate is 60 bits per second.\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GLO 1878\n0094-8534196196GL-0 1878$05.00\n\nIt is composed of two parts : the digital processing unit (DPU)\nproviding the interface to the ATLAS pallet and the absolute\nradiometer with its electronics (see Figure 1).\nSOLCON is a differential absolute radiometer with two\nchannels. The incident radiative energy absorbed in a cavity is\ncompared to electrical energy dissipated by the Joule effect,\ntaking into account the nonequivalence of energies, as well as the\ngeometric, thermal, optic and electrical characteristics of the\ninstrument.\nWhen the SOLCON radiometer is pointed toward the sun, one\nshutter of the cavity is opened. The heat balance system\ncompensates for the added heat until the heat fluxes are again\nbalanced between the open and closed cavities. The shutter is\nthen closed, and power is adjusted to its original value\nautomatically. The difference in the power required to maintain a\nheat balance between the two cavities during open and closed\noperations is a function of total solar radiation.\nThe SOLCONIDIARAD radiometer for the ATLAS missions\nis identical to the SOVA IIDIARAD radiometer flown on the\nEuropean Retrievable Carrier (EURECA). Both instruments are\nimproved versions of the absolute radiometer flown on\nSPACELAB 1. Both SOLCON and SOVA 1 have been designed\nto provide the ultimate radiometric accuracy consistent with the\nstate of the art metrological usage. The measurement philosophy\nis primarily based on :\na) the differential design of the radiometer\nb) the independent characterization of each channel\nc) the continuous electrical calibration interwaved with the solar\nmeasurements, with a high, accurate and stable voltage reference.\nd) the verification of the internal coherence of the measurements\nsuch as the accurate retrieval of the heaters resistance.\nSOLCON operates efficiently, allowing temperature changes\nof up to 35\'C with the uncertainty in the absolute accuracy of the\nsolar constant measurement evaluated to be less than k0.1%. The\ndata resolution is 22 bits.\n\nThe Results Obtained during the ATLAS Missions\nDuring the first ATLAS mission in March 1992, at the middle\nof the descending part of solar cycle 22, the sun was quite active\nand a cluster of sunspots passed over the solar disk from one limb\nto the other. The data obtained on the two successive solar\nobservation periods of days 85 and 89 show a difference of more\nthan 1.5 Wm-2,which is more than 0.1 % variance.\nThe SOLCON left and right channel measurements of the\ndifferential absolute radiometer, characterized independently,\nshowed a difference of 0.06% consistent with the level of\nuncertainty on the evaluated absolute accuracy of SOLCON.\n\n2293\n\n2294\n\nCROMMELYNCK ET AL. : SOLAR CONSTANT OBSERVATIONS FROM THE ATLAS MISSIONS\nspacecrafts as well as the European Retrievable Carrier\n(EURECA) were carrying six other radiometers to measure the\nsolar irradiance, representing the first time that such a space\nradiometric comparison has been performed. Compared to usual\nground radiometric comparison conditions at high altitude sites\nlike Table Mountain Observatory (TMO) or WRCD/Davos (CH),\nthe solar source target was much more stable in the absence of\ncircumsolar sky radiation and variable absorption of the\natmosphere.\nA mean solar constant was calculated at 1366.22 Wm\'2 and for\neach radiometric channel an "adjustment factor" (see Table 1) was\ndetermined, realizing de facto the definition of the SARR.\nThe Adjustment Factor (or multiplication factor) given for each\ninstrument enables all the data to be reduced to the SARR. The\nresulting Solar constant value provides the state of the art\naccuracy.\nDuring the third ATLAS mission in October 1994, the sun was\nagain very quiet and the solar irradiance very stable.

SOLCON radiometer and DPU\n\nOn days 91 and 92, the irradiance values increased as the\nsunspots were reaching the solar limb. The situation encountered\nduring this mission is very favorable for the detection of time\nstamp errors in databases. This is indeed illustrated with the\nACRIM I1 daily mean observations, in which a two day shift is\nidentified (see Figure 2) (Data can be acquired Erom the\njpl.simdac anonymous ftp server, April 14th, 1995, file).\nDuring the second ATLAS mission in April, 1993, the Sun was\nvery quiet and the Solar irradiance very stable. Very few to no\nsunspots were observed.\nOver the whole ATLAS-2 mission, the measured mean solar\nconstant of each of the five solar observation periods did not\nchange more than 0.3 wme2.During the first mission, meanwhile,\nthe dispersion during each orbit was of the order of 0.5 ~ m This difference is mainly due to solar noise as the SOLCON\ninstrument noise is about one order of magnitude smaller.\nOf particular significance to the ATLAS-2 mission is the fact\nthat simultaneously to ACR and SOLCON, the UARS and ERBS\n\n-\n\nATLAS 2\n\n\'"t\n,=T\n\nATLAS 3\n\nFigure 2.\nCompared results obtained by the SOLCON\n~ .\nexperiment during the three successive ATLAS missions.

During the ATLAS-3 mission on the Space Shuttle\nAtlantis (STS-66) in November of 1994, a unique opportunity\narose that enabled the solar-viewing instruments to observe\nultraviolet radiation from the Moon. During these observations\nthe Moon was at a phase angle of 51.8". Measurements by the\nShuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) i w u m e n t indicate lunar geometric albedo values, after correction to full moon,\nof 4.4%-8.3% in the wavelength range from 250 nm to 400 nm.\nThese results are in good agreement with past measurements.\n\nplanets and asteroids and can also be used directly for the calibration of orbiting satellites, as proposed for the Global Ozone\nMonitoring Experiment (GOME) [Vuorilehto ef al., 19941. The\nEarth Observing System (EOS) platform will also contain\ninstruments which plan on using the Moon as a calibration target, including the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and\nReflectance Radiometer (ASTER), and the Moderate Resolution\nImaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).\nIn this paper we present measurements of the lunar geometric\nalbedo in the ultraviolet, taken at one phase angle and then corrected to zero phase, and compare these results with previous\nIntroduction\nmeasurements.

When viewing the Sun a quartz\ndiffuser is deployed to minimize the effect of field-of-view\n(FOV) non-uniformities on the measurement. Due to the low\nsignal levels expected, SSBUV could not view the Moon through\nthe diffuser so data were collected in the Earth-view mode. The\ninstrument was set to its discrete sample mode which scans a set\nof 12 wavelengths with an integration time of 1.25 seconds at\neach wavelength. Sixteen scans were collected during the time\nthe shuttle was pointed at the Moon and the I-sigma standard\ndeviation in this data set was about 10% at 250 nm and 2% at\n400 nm. The lunar observations were performed during the\nshadowed portion of orbit 157 of the ATLAS3 mission, with\ndata collected between 12:55 UT and 1 3 ~ 1 UT on ~~~~~b~~ 13,\n3\n1994. me\ndeviation in the shuttle pointing angle during\nthis time was 0.06", with a measured offset of the Moon with\nrespect to the instrument\'s optical axis of -0.7" in the shuttle xz\nplane, and -0.2" in the yz plane. Solar irradiance measurements\nwere collected periodically during the flight, and measurements\nat the lunar observation wavelengths were performed during orbit\n158 with I-sigma standard deviations less than 0.5%.\n\nGeometrical Correction of the Calibration\nIt is useful to define the calibration constants for the two\nviewing modes of the SSBUV instrument. The equation describing the instrument sensitivity in the irradiance or solar-view\nmode is\n= E ( l ) we. ~ o )\nC(L)\n\'\n\n(I)\n\nwhere E(h) is the irradiance of a standard source of spectral\nis\nirradiance, G(B,@) a goniometric factor, and C(h) is the instrument response in counts on one of three gain ranges. The equivalent calibration constant for the radiance or Earth-view mode,\nassuming normal illumination of the target, is\n\nwhere F ( Q ) is a correction factor for instrument vignetting and\noff-axis illumination of the viewed target, BRDF is the bidirectional reflectance distribution function of the illuminated\ntarget, and c(h) the response of the instrument in counts.\nSince the calibration of SSBUV in the Earth-view mode\nconsists of illuminating an extended source which fills the 11.5"\ndegree rectangular FOV, and the Moon is under-filling this view\nwith an angular extent of 0.504", we need to calculate the\ndifference in throughput factors between these two geometries.\nThe throughput at the position of an aperture stop in an optical\nsystem can be defined as\n\nwhere a is the area of the aperture (entrance slit in our case), and\nR is the solid angle subtended by the source. Using (3) and\nassuming there are no variations in the FOV response of the\ninstrument, the calibration parameters are modified by the ratio of\nsolid angles subtended by the two sources. This was calculated to\nbe 670. However, the SSBUV FOV response is not constant over\nthe full FOV and one must account for these variations.\nUsing the SSBUV instrument manufacturer\'s measurements of\nthe response within \'the FOV [Ball Aerospace, 19841, an\n\nFigure 1. SSBUV measured FOV response at 1.lo resolution.\nThe x-axis represents the variation in FOV response in the plane\ndefined by the optical axis of the instrument and the short\ndimension of the instrument aperture, The y-axis refers to the\nlong dimension of the\n\neffective solid angle ratio was calculated by taking the solid angle\nof the Moon, weighted by the average FOV response over the\nMoon\'s angular extent, and dividing that quantity by a weighted\nfull FOV average. Since there is a significant depression in the\nSSBUV FOV response at the center of the field, (see Figure I),\nthe calibration adjustment factor is reduced by about 17% to 555.\nme primary uncertainty in the\nadjustment\nfactor is due to the angular resolution of the FOV\nmeasurements, since the correction factor for scenes that\nsubtend angles smaller than 1.lo could be in error. Also, there\nmay have been shifts in the FOV response over the ten year\nperiod since these measurements were made. For this reason\nan alternative calibration method was developed which does\nnot rely on the extended source calibration described by\nEquation (2). This method uses the ratio of the instrument\nresponse to a source with small angular extent, with and\nwithout the instrument diffuser deployed. In this mode the\ninstrument averages the source radiation over an area in the\nFOV which is similar to that illuminated by the Moon.\nResults from both calibration methods are compared in the\nnext two sections.\n\nGeometric Albedo Calculation\nTo calculate the geometric albedo, the ratio was taken between\nthe digital counts in the lunar observations and digital counts in\nthe solar observations, after correction for the appropriate gain\nranges, and multiplied by the solid angle correction discussed in\nthe previous section. The calculation of the geometric albedo\nfrom the ratio takes the form [Lucke, 19761\n\nwhere S, is the lunar count value, S, is the solar count value,\nK,(h) is the instrument albedo calibration, which is the ratio of\nEquation (2) to Equation (I), the factor 1A is the Lambertian\nfactor at 0\xc2\xb0, and F,(h) is the lunar phase correction used to\nconvert the SSBUV measurement at a viewing angle of 51 .8" to\nwhat would be seen from a full Moon.\nFigure 2 shows calculated values of the phase function for a\nphase angle of 51 .8" based on measurements by Lane and Irvine\n\nJANZ ET AL.: OBSERVATIONS O F THE LUNAR GEOMETRIC ALBEDO\n0.35\n\nirradiance, corrected for the angular size of the Moon and the\n0\n1964 doto Lone ond lwine 1973\n2(\n\n1965 doto: Lone ond lrvine [I9731\n\nX\n\n- .A - -Polynomial 7Fit1 [includes lor-UV\n- Lucke [ I 9 6\n.\n\n-\n\n0.30\n\n-\n\n0.25\n\n-- -\n\nk\nE\n\n2299\n\n.:-\'\n\n-\n\nLineor Fit\n\n.- .-\n\npoint]\n\n...... .a--:\n-*- m -\n\ndistance between the Moon and the Shuttle.

The data most appropriate for the Comparison with Previous Results\nSSBUV view angle are the 1965 measurements for a waxing\nA comparison of the SSBUV albedo values with previous\nMoon. A linear fit was used to interpolate these measurements to\nthe SSBUV wavelengths. The theoretical wavelengths chosen to measurements is presented in Figure 3. The dashed and dotted\nrepresent the visible and far-ultraviolet data points in the Lucke line in the figure is the fit that appears in Lucke [I9761 to a\net al. [I9761 calculations are somewhat arbitrary given the slowly variety of measurements including ground-based, rocket, and\nvarying nature of the single particle scattering function. Also, Apollo 17 measurements of the lunar albedo, and measurements\nLucke et al. [I9761 argue that the far-ultraviolet point should be of the reflectivity of lunar dust samples [Lucke, 19731.\nThe SSBUV values using both calibration methods agree with\nadjusted upward by approximately 10%. For these reasons a\nthe linear fit given by Lucke [I9761 to an average over this\nlinear fit, including only the measured points of Lane and Irvine\n[1973], is used to interpolate (and extrapolate) the phase function wavelength region of 10%. with the alternative calibration\napproach yielding better agreement.

The only correction\nrequired is to compensate for how the instrument averages the\ncalibration source over variations in the FOV response relative to\nthe Moon, at its position within the FOV. Using the FOV\nresponse measured with the QTH and deuterium lamps, this\ncorrection was calculated to be 21% due to the fact that the Moon\nwas not viewed directly at the center of the FOV. Second,\nalthough the FOV response was measured at various wavelengths with little or no wavelength dependence observed, the\nresolution of this measurement could wash out such an effect for\nsmall angular sources. However, the alternative calibration\nmethod should correctly incorporate any wavelength dependence\nfor sources of a similar size.\nThere are three main contributions to the uncertainties in the\nSSBUV measurements using the FOV calibration method. First,\nthe correction due to the differing angular size of the Moon\nversus the calibrated view when the full instrument FOV is\nilluminated. This error is estimated to be about 5% based on\nvariations in the method used to integrate the function used for\nthe FOV response (see Figure 1). The error could be larger if the\nFOV response of the instrument has changed since the time of the\noriginal measurements. Second, uncertainties in the exact\nposition of the Moon within the FOV lead to an uncertainty in\nthe adjustment of the calibration on the order of 5%. Third, there\nis some uncertainty in the phase correction function, more so at\nthe shorter wavelengths where we have extrapolated from\nprevious measurements. If we use the standard deviation of the\nlinear fit to the phase data in Figure 3, this uncertainty is\nestimated to be 2% between 350 nm and 400 nm and possibly\nlarger for wavelengths below 350 nm (The 1965 data points have\nan estimated uncertainty of about 5% [Lane and Irvine, 19731).\nWe have eliminated the first uncertainty by using the alternative\ncalibration approach. In addition the alternative approach\nremoves any uncertainty in the measurement of the reflectivity\n(BRDF) of the extended source (see Equation (2)). The primary\nerror sources remaining are due to the lunar position and phase\ncorrection. These are represented by the error bars in Figure 3.\n\nConclusions\nThe lunar geometric albedo measured by the SSBUV\ninstrument during the ATLAS-3 mission agrees to within 2% on\naverage with the best fit to historical values. These measurements have provided additional data for the ultraviolet region\nbetween 250 nm and 350 nm with improved accuracy due to the\ncontiguous measurement of the solar flux with the same instrument. We also presented calibrated lunar radiance measurements\nwhich should prove useful in estimating expected signal-to-noise\nlevels for instruments that will use the Moon as a calibration\nsource. On the most recent flight of SSBUV (STS-72) we were\nable to repeat these measurements at a phase angle near 90" and\nat additional wavelengths. Results from this flight will be\nreported at a future time.\nAcknowledgments.

ATMOS makes solar-occultation observations of\ninfrared spectra using a Fourier transform interferometer.\nMAS uses a limb-scanning antenna to measure emission\nspectra at millimeter wavelengths. SSBUV is a nadir-viewing\ninstrument measuring the transmission of scattered solar\nultraviolet radiation modified by ozone absorption. A sample\nof zonal-mean mixing ratio profiles indicates that these three\nATLAS instruments generally agree to within lo%, although\na few potential biases have been noted.

The common thread among the three is the fact that\nall measure ozone. In this Letter we present a quantitative\ncomparison of ozone measurements made by all three\natmospheric instruments on board ATLAS 1,2, and 3.

ATMOS measures 32 profiles per day at specific\nlocations determined by occultation requirements. MAS\nmakes continuous measurements, barring other mission\ncontingencies. The MAS data has been radiance-averaged\nover each mission into 5\' latitude bins. A zonal-mean ozone\nprofile results from retrieval of these averaged spectra.\nSSBUV, being a nadir-viewing instrument, provides the\ngreatest coverage, with roughly 420 profiles per day. These\nthree data sets provide overlapping samples of the atmosphere\nfrom which we may attempt to ascertain the compatibility of\nthe measurements. The latitudinal coverage of each of the\ninstruments is indicated in Table 1. The coverage of both\nMAS and SSBUV is large enough to permit examination of a\nzonal cross-section of differences as a function of\naltitude/pressure and latitude. The nature of the ATMOS\ninstrument is such that a more limited number of\nmeasurements were made. However, there were sufficient\ncoincident data to make zonal mean comparisons at several\nlatitudes. Therefore, two approaches are used here: zonal\nmean profiles within specific latitude bands are compared for\nall three instruments at 30\xc2\xb0S (for ATLAS 1 and 2) and SOON\n(for ATLAS 3), and zonal mean profiles as a function of\nlatitude are compared for MAS and SSBUV.

Also, the SSBUV profile peaks at a lower\npressure than the other two, which appear to peak at the same\npressure. Near the ozone mixing ratio peak, the measurements\nfrom the three instruments disagree by up to 15%. In the lower\nstratosphere, below 20 mb, MAS is about 20 % lower than\nATMOS. The reason for this discrepancy between MAS and\nATMOS, which exists for all missions, is not clear, but\ncomparisons with other datasets indicate that MAS is\nprobably biased low below 20 mb (and also near 1 mb).\nZonal means and percentage differences from ATLAS 2,\nalso at 30\xc2\xb0S, are shown in Figure lb. In general the\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50\ncomparisons are much better than for ATLAS 1, and all three\nLatitude\nprofiles are in good agreement at the peak, with mixing ratios\nATLAS-2 Ozone: (MAS-SSBUV)/SSBUV %\nof about 8 ppmv. Once again, the SSBUV profile peaks at a\nlower pressure. In the upper stratosphere, from 2 to 10 mb,\nMAS and ATMOS are in excellent agreement, with less than\n2 % differences, while SSBUV is still somewhat higher, but\nwithin 5% of the mean. SSBUV appears to be biased low just\nbelow the peak, down to about 20 mb. MAS and ATMOS\ncontinue to agree well, within 5%, from the peak down to 20\nmb. Below 20 mb MAS is again biased low relative to\nATMOS, with differences reaching 20% at 50 mb.\nIt is noteworthy to compare the relative variations between\nATLAS 1 and 2 indicated in the 30" S zonal average plots. At\nthe mixing ratio peak, all three instruments observed lower\nozone mixing ratios in ATLAS 2 than in ATLAS 1 by about\n0.5 to 1.0 ppmv. We have also obtained data from the UARS\nMicrowave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument for the ATLAS 1\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50\nand ATLAS 2 time periods from the Goddard Distributed\nLatitude\nActive Archive Center (DAAC) [Barath et al., 19931. At the\nmixing ratio peak at 30" S, MLS observed an ozone decrease\nATLAS-3 Ozone: (MAS-SSBUV)/SSBUV %\nbetween ATLAS 1 and 2 of 5-lo%, while the mean decrease\nobserved by the ATLAS instruments is 7-8%. In the lower\nstratosphere (below 20 mb), both the ATMOS and MAS\nretrieved mixing ratios are higher in ATLAS 2 than in ATLAS\n1, although the magnitude of this increase is greater in MAS\nthan in ATMOS ( 15% compared to 5%). MLS measurements\nindicate an increase of about lo%, in good agreement with the\nATLAS measurements. In the upper stratosphere centered on\nabout 2 mb, higher mixing ratios are indicated in ATLAS 2\nthan in ATLAS 1. However, the magnitude of this increase\nvaries significantly. In the MAS retrievals the increase was\nabout 15%, 10% for ATMOS, and in SSBUV retrievals\nthe increase is quite small (< 4%). The variation in the\nMLS data in this altitude region is also small ( 4 % ),\nconsistent with the SSBUV data.\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50\nATLAS 3 zonal means and differences at 50" N are\nLatitude\npresented in Figure lc.

Over the range of latitude and altitude for (a) ATLAS 1 , (b) ATLAS 2 , and (c)\nthe peak, which is broad in all three cases because of the high ATLAS 3.\nlatitude of the comparison, there are differences of 0.5 ppm.\nAs pointed out above, SSBUV and MAS can be compared\nover a much more extensive latitude range than that possible ATLAS 1,2,and 3 respectively.

For this purpose, in ratio values themselves, and the range of these measurements,\nfigures 2a, b, and c we present contour plots of percentage may be found in the MAS overview Letter (Hartrnann et al.,\nzonal average differences between MAS and SSBUV for this issue). In general, the contour plots show the same\n\n2304\n\nKRIEBEL ET AL., A COMPARISON OF OZONE MEASUREMENTS\n\ngeneral characteristics as that indicated in the profile\ncomparisons shown in Figure 1. The most striking feature is\nthe significant improvement in the agreement between the two\ninstruments in ATLAS 2 versus ATLAS 1, especially near 10\nmb and again at 2 mb. The reason for this improvement is not\ncompletely understood currently, but in the lower stratosphere\nmay be related to the significantly different stratospheric\naerosol loading between the two missions. Because of Mt.\nPinatubo, the aerosol loading over the equator was greater\nduring ATLAS 1 than in ATLAS 2. The MAS retrievals\nshould be largely immune to the aerosol loading environment,\nbut, as mentioned previously, stratospheric aerosols could\ncause the SSBUV retrieved mixing ratios to be\nunderestimated at 10 mb by about 10%. Therefore,\nstratospheric aerosols could be at least partially responsible\nfor the large region of positive MAS-SSBUV differences\ncentered on the equator at 10 mb. In ATLAS 2 and 3, the\nMAS and SSBUV retrievals agree to within lo%, which is\ngenerally within the accuracy limits of the three instruments.\nHowever, even in ATLAS 2 and 3, there does appear to be a\nsystematic positive bias in the lower stratosphere of order 510% (MAS higher than SSBUV), and less than 5% in the\nupper stratosphere.\n\nConclusions\nIn general, the comparisons between the ATLAS\ninstruments are quite good, with the three agreeing to f 10 %.\nThis is generally within the combined measurement and\nretrieval errors. Thus, these limited comparisons have\nindicated that the measurements are suitable for the\natmospheric studies appearing in this issue. Each of the three\ninstruments employs a different observation technique and\nmeasures radiation in a different wavelength band, haking\nthese results particularly satisfying.\nHowever, there are several systematic features of the\ncomparisons which will require further study. First, the MAS\nozone retrievals are consistently low below 20 mb, a\ndiscrepancy which may be due partly to differing instrumental\nsensitivities, but may also indicate a bias of up to 10% .\nSecond, the SSBUV retrievals appear to peak at lower\npressures than the others, and to be biased low just below the\npeak down to 20 mb. Third, between ATLAS 1 and ATLAS 2\nthere seems to be a change in the nature of the agreement\nbetween the various measurements, namely, that MAS and\nATMOS profiles were consistently lower than SSBUV in the\nmid- and upper stratosphere by about 10% during ATLAS 1,\nbut are in much better agreement during ATLAS 2 and 3. In\naddition, at or below the peak of the ozone distribution, the\nMASISSBUV agreement is significantly better in ATLAS 2\n\nand 3 compared to ATLAS 1, especially in the tropics. These\nchanges may be due, in part, to differing aerosol environments\nduring these missions.\n\nReferences\nAbrams, M.C., M.R. Gunson, A.Y. Chang, C.P.

The Shuttle SBUV (SSBUV) conducted its fourth and\nfifth flights in late March 1992 and early April 1993 along with\nthe ATLAS-1 and ATLAS-2 Shuttle missions, respectively. The\ntwo successive SSBUV flights yielded ozone data nearly one year\napart. An analysis of the meteorological conditions, namely\ntemperature and winds, during the two flight periods indicate that\nthe conditions in the stratosphere were very similar. The\ntemperatures had significantly warmed from winter throughout\nmost of the stratosphere and the circulation was approaching\nnormal summertime conditions for both periods. SSBUV-4, flown\nin 1992, measured ozone from approximately 30s to 60N while\nSSBUV-5, flown in 1993, measured ozone from approximately\n55s to 60N. Zonal average column ozone amounts were derived\nfrom the two flights and compared to determine if a systematic\nchange in ozone could be detected despite the fact that only a few\ndays from each year were sampled. The comparison indicates that\nin the latitude range 30N to 60N total ozone was lower in 1993\nthan in 1992 by about 12%. This change is larger than the\nobservational errors and the expected interannual variations. This\nresult verifies similar data taken from ground and satellites.\n\nIntroduction\nUnprecedented ozone changes have been detected since 1991\nover northern hemisphere mid-latitudes. Ozone depletion has\nbeen reported by Glemon et al. [1993], and Planet et al. [I9941\nfrom NOAA SBUVI2 (Solar Backscatter UltravioletlMod2) and by\nHerman and Larko [I9941 from NASA TOMS (Total Ozone\nMapping Spectrometer) satellite data in the northern hemisphere\nafter 1990. Similar findings have been reported from groundbased data by Hofmann et al. [I994], Bojkov et al. [1993], and\nniore recently by Bojkov et al. [I9951 who show ozone changes,\nin 1993, similar to the ATLAS data. The more recent decline of\nozone values at mid to high latitudes have now been attributed to\ncold temperatures, increasing amounts of C10, and Pinatubo\naerosols which spread to extra-tropical latitudes [WMO, 19941.\nGround, satellite, and now Shuttle-based data show that ozone\nreduction was more pronounced during the second winter after\nPinatubo than during the first. Hofmann et al. 119941 concluded\nthis decrease results from several factors, including unusually\ncold\ntemperatures, additional time for chemical processing, and aerosols\nreaching higher latitudes after the second year (winter 1992-1993).\nAdditional causes could be attributed to steadily increasing\n\'NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt MD\n\'Hughes STX Corporation, Greenbelt, MD\n3General Science Corporation, Laurel MD\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GLO1120\n0094-8534196196GL-01120$05.00\n\n<.\n\n/\n\namounts of C10. The observed ozone changes are also consistent\nwith a quasibiennial oscillation (QBO) effect as described by\nYang and Tung [1994]. A solar cycle contribution is also possible\nsince this period is during the steep descending period of solar\ncycle 22. However, for this period the changes in ozone are less\nthan 1% for solar cycle effects.\nAlthough satellites have given a fairly consistent picture of this\ndepletion, the precise change has not been established since\nupdates to the calibration of both SBUVR and TOMS data sets\nare planned using data from regular Shuttle SBUV (SSBUV)\nflights. For example, the SBUVI2 data reported by Planet et al.\n[I9941 are still subject to calibration uncertainties [Hilsenrath et\nal., 19951. Reprocessing of this data set from 1989 to 1995 is\nplanned in 1996. The entire Nimbus TOMS data set (1979\nthough 1993) is also undergoing a major recalibration and will be\navailable by mid 1996. Since the purpose of SSBUV is to\nprovide a calibration transfer to SBUVf2 and to validate TOMS\ndata, it was thought appropriate to use SSBUV data taken during\nthe ATLAS flights to verify the conclusions derived from the\nsatellite data sets that are now available. The first step in this\nverification is to demonstrate that the SSBUV measurements are\nsufficiently precise to detect year to year changes, particularly in\nthe presence of aerosols, which can contaminate backscatter\nultraviolet (BUV) radiances. The second step is to demonstrate\nthat the observed changes do not result from the 1992 and 1993\nsamples being taken in different phases of the annual cycle.\n\nSSBUV Ozone Measumments\nThe SSBUV has flown 8 times since 1989 where three of those\nflights were with ATLAS. The SSBUV is an SBUVR instrument\nmodified for Shuttle flight. The primary goal is to provide\ncalibration checks of BUV ozone instruments flying on NOAA\noperational and NASA research satellites [Hilsenrath et al., 19881.\nSSBUV data have been used to update the calibration of the\nNOAA-11 SBUVR data set for the period 1989 to 1993\n[Hilsenrath et al., 19951 and further refinements are planned.\nSSBUV observes the Earth\'s ultraviolet directional albedo to\nprovide ozone profiles from about 20 to 55 km [Bhmtia et al.,\n19951 as well as total column ozone [Klenk et al., 19821. Ozone\nprofiles from the ground to about 25 km are calculated from a\nclimatology of low, mid, and high latitudes scaled by the total\nozone amounts.\nThe accuracy of total ozone retrievals from SBUV instmments\ndepends primarily on wavelength dependent calibration errors,\nbecause total ozone is derived from radiances taken in wavelength\npairs, allowing wavelength independent calibration errors to cancel\nout [Ahmad et al., 19941. A 1% wavelength independent\ncalibration error translates into less than a 0.3% error in total\nozone. Wavelength dependent errors cause ozone errors ranging\nfrom 1-96, where the larger errors occur at higher solar zenith\nangles. SSBUV calibration and wavelength accuracy and\nprecision have been discussed by Hilsenrath et al. [1991], Cebula\n\nHlLSENRATH ET AL.: OZONE CHANGE FROM 1992TO 1993 OBSERVED FROM SSBUV ON ATLAS-1 AND ATLAS-2\n\nSSRIIV-4 GRID OZONE (Dohson\n\n&\n.\n\n:\n?\n\nPC+$-@\nL\n;\n\n1\n\nC\'&~k.W~-~~&~tQ~Q.o~E~~~~~l\n. -.\n\n1\n\nFigure 1. a) Total ozone map for SSBUV-4 on ATLAS-1 (1992).

[I9951 who show wavelength\nindependent and dependent calibration errors to be less than 1%\nand of the order of 0.1%, respectively from flight to flight.\nSSBUV total ozone values are therefore consistent to better than\n1% from flight to flight. The accuracy of retrieved ozone profiles\nare more sensitive to absolute calibration errors. Bhartia et al.\n[I9951 estimated profile errors from SBUV type measurements to\nrange between 5-10% between 1 and 30 hPa.\nStratospheric aerosols modify ozone absorption of ultraviolet\nradiation through additional scattering, thereby contributing errors\nto the retrieved ozone profiles and column amounts [Toms and\nBhartia, 19951. The ozone profile error is a function of aerosol\noptical depth, aerosol altitude, and solar zenith angle. When\nobserving through\nvolcanic aerosols, ozone amounts are\nunderestimated by 10% near 10 hPa and overestimated by an\nequal percentage near 30 hPa at a 30\' solar zenith angle.\nRadiative transfer calculations by Bhartia et al. [I9931 show that\nexcept for very high solar zenith angles, errors in total ozone\nderived from aerosol contaminated BUV radiances range from -2\nto +2% depending on solar zenith angles. This error becomes\nlarger at solar zenith angles greater than 75". For ATLAS-1 the\nPinatubo aerosols were never observed at angles larger than 70"\nin latitudes greater than 50N, therefore total ozone errors remained\nbelow 2%. For ATLAS-2 the aerosol spread to higher latitudes\nbut their height and optical depth decreased, reducing errors in\ntotal ozone to less than 2% at mid to high latitudes.\n\nDiscussion\nOzone Change fmm the Spring of 1992 to Spring of 1993\nSSBUV on ATLAS-1 collected ozone data during the period\nMarch 28-31, 1992 over a latitude range from 275 to 57N. For\nATLAS-2, ozone data were collected during the period April 9-13,\n1993 from 57s to 57N. These data were gridded and are\nillustrated in Figures l a and lb. To simplify the estimated change\nover the two measurement periods, zonal averages were computed\nfrom the two data sets and shown in Figure 2a. The ratio of the\n\nzonal averages between the two flights, 199311992, is shown in\nFigure 2b. There is a marked ozone decrease in northern\nhemisphere mid and high latitudes, exceeding 15% near 60N (this\nlatitude zone only contains data from 55-57" since the inclination\nof the ATLAS-2 orbits was 57"). The smaller ozone changes in\ntropical and subtropical latitudes which appear in Figure 2b will\nbe discussed later.\nThe SSBUV longitudinal coverage was not the same for the\ntwo data periods, as can be seen in Figure l a and b, particularly\nover Siberia, a region which is usually covered by large ozone\namounts in late winter. Exclusion of this local ozone high could\nbias the data such that the decrease in Figure 2b is\nunderestimated. In order to examine the effect of the Siberian\nhigh, a comparable region was excluded in the ATLAS-2 data and\nthe comparison repeated. The comparison showed essentially the\nsame latitude gradients seen in Figure 2a. A further screen,\ndiscussed in the next section, on the two data sets excluded air\nfrom the lower stratospheric polar vortex in the zonal averages.\nIn order to determine the vertical structure of the ozone change\nin the stratosphere, SSBUV measured ozone profiles were\nexamined for this period. Zonally averaged height- latitude cross\nsections showed no significant change in ozone amounts at\naltitudes higher than 25 hPa. The absence of changes in the upper\nstratosphere, which would have to be large to contribute to the\nobserved total ozone change, indicates that the ozone change seen\nin the two SSBUV flights primarily occurred below 25 km. The\nspecific altitude for the change can not be established since SBUV\nozone profiles lack vertical resolution in this region. However,\nthis observed change is consistent with the findings of Hofmann\net al.

This would\ndelay and reduce the amount of ozone normally released from the\npolar night region from reaching mid latitudes. In addition, the\ncolder temperatures would tend to form polar stratospheric clouds\nin the presence of Pinatubo aerosols, resulting in increased ozone\ndepletion through heterogeneous chemistry. The ATLAS data\nshow that the low ozone amounts persisted into the springtime\neven after the vortex broke down. Finally, some of the ozone\nchange is attributable to the QBO since there was a complete turn\naround (easterly to westerly) in the 30 hPa Singapore winds.\nHollandsworth et al. [I9951 have shown a 15 Dobson Unit\nvariation in SBUV data (1979-1990) due to the QBO at mid and\nhigh latitudes during the spring months when the Singapore wind\nchanges by 45 meters per second. This can account for most the\nchange near 30N but only about one third of the change at higher\nlatitudes (Figure 2b).\n\nin similar air masses. In general, for both ATLAS-1 and -2, the\nnorthern hemisphere was well on its way to a normal summertime\ncirculation pattern. The mid-latitude temperatures had warmed\nsince its coldest temperatures during the January-February period\nfor both years throughout the mid to lower stratosphere. To\nillustrate the similarities of the two periods, the National\nMeteorological Center\'s 50N zonal mean temperature, and the 60N\nzonal mean zonal wind (both at 50 hPa) are shown in Figure 3a\nand 3b. Mid-latitude temperatures during the ATLAS-1 and\nATLAS-2 periods were both near 218 K. Zonal mean zonal wind\nreflects the decay from the strong mid-winter jet to the relatively\nweak jet in April. Both the ATLAS-I and ATLAS-2 periods\nshowed weakened but coherent vortices displaced off of the north\npole into the Siberia region, with a larger vortex in 1992 than in\n1993 [Manney et al. 1994bl. While these zonal mean zonal winds\nreflect similar wind speeds, about lOm/s in 1992 and just under\nlOm/s in 1993, the polar vortex persisted with some SSBUV\nobservations into this region. To remove aliasing in either the\n1992 or 1993 data, ozone measurements inside the vortex (based\non potential vorticity maps on the 400 K isentropic surface) were\nexcluded from this analysis. The 1992 to 1993 comparison\ntherefore only includes air outside the polar vortex.\nTropical and subtropical ozone changes seen in Figure 2b are\nclearly related to the quasibiennial oscillation (QBO). Hilsenrath\nand Schlesinger [I9811 and Oltmans and London [I9821\ndemonstrated the phase, as a function of latitude, of the QBO total\nozone relationship using satellite data. They showed the westerly\nphase of the QBO (as in 1993) is correlated with high tropical\nozone and low subtropical ozone, while the easterly phase (as in\n1992) has the opposite effect. This QBO - ozone relationship is\ndriven by the secondary circulation associated with the QBO\n[Plumb and Bell, 19841 and is consistent with the ozone increase\nin the tropics between 1992 and 1993 and the corresponding\ndecrease at subtropical latitudes.

[I9951 have demonstrated that QBO\ninduced ozone decreases for this period would only account for\nabout one third of the change seen in the ATLAS data at high\nlatitudes.\nDespite the fact that ATLAS-] and ATLAS-2 took only\nsnapshots of the spring stratosphere in 1992 and 1993, a clear\nozone decline over the two years was revealed at mid and high\nlatitudes. The ozone change is well outside the errors of the\nSSBUV measurement, which are small, even when considering\naerosol contaminated radiances. It also finally demonstrated that\nthe zonal average decline is not due to sampling different times in\nthe ozone annual cycle nor can the change be fully explained by\nthe QBO. Therefore the large ozone decline observed from these\ntwo missions further verifies similar changes seen by other\nobservations from space and ground stations over this period. Its\nlikely cause is a combination of residual cold winter temperatures\nand the presence of active chlorine and Pinatubo aerosols.\nAcknowledgemenls.

Qualitatively similar\nfeatures are observed by UARS instruments. Another\npossibly related feature has been observed by groundbased remote sensing from the South Pole over an extended season. In all these cases, it seems likely that\nactive photochemistry and highly structured horizontal\nand vertical transport play important roles. Some evidence of a similar feature is also present in a current 2-D\nphotochemical model. This high latitude phenomenon\nis both an intriguing challenge for current 3-D models\nand potentially useful test for validating remote sensing\nexperiments.\n\nwater vapor, as well as temperature and pressure derived from three oxygen lines. Ozone measurements\n(with approximately 3 km vertical resolution) cover the\naltitude range from about 20 km to 80 km [Hartmann et\nal., 19961, and as high as 90 km (at night) [Bevilacqua\net al., 19961.\nThe stratosphere at polar and sub-polar latitudes has\nreceived significant attention in the past decade. This\nis especially true for the winter through early spring periods when enormous reductions of ozone are observed\n[Farman et al., 1985; Solomon 19901. Ozone observations by MAS occur in the late spring and late fall seasons. These observations reveal additional ozone structure at the same latitudes that is much less well known.\nThe purpose of this Letter is to exhibit this phenomenon\nas it appears in the MAS data set and to offer a simple\nexplanation for its existence.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMAS Observations\n\nThe Millimeter-wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS) is\nan international experiment which has flown on three\nSpacelab pallet missions - the ATLAS(KJ\'mospheric\nLaboratory for Applications and Science) series - in\n1992-1994, aboard the Space Shuttle [Croskey et al.,\n1992 and Hartmann et al., 19961. The experiment consists of a large limb-viewing millimeter-wavelength total\npower radiometer-spectrometer system operating simultaneously in three frequency bands: 60, 183, and 204\nGHz; measuring the thermal microwave radiation from\nthe Earth\'s limb emitted from rotational transitions of\noxygen(Oz), water vapor(HzO), ozone(Os), and chlorine monoxide(ClO), respectively. These observations\nyield mixing ratio profiles of ozone, chlorine monoxide,\n\nDepending upon the orientation of the Shuttle itself\n(at an altitude of ~ 3 0 km, and a 57\' inclination orbit),\n0\nMAS can make measurements from about 70\' in one\nhemisphere to about 40\xc2\xb0 in the other hemisphere. MAS\nobserving periods have occurred as follows: ATLAS1, March 24 to April 2, 1992 (with coverage mostly\nbetween 40\xc2\xb0S and 70\xc2\xb0N); ATLAS-2, April 8 to April\n17, 1993 (70\xc2\xb0S to 70\xc2\xb0N); and ATLAS-3, November 3\nand November 4, 1994 (40\xc2\xb0S to 70\xc2\xb0N). Thus MAS has\nobserved the Arctic in two successive years in spring\nand once in fall, the Antarctic once in fall.\nIn Figures 1-3, we show examples of ozone vertical\nprofiles from these ATLAS missions. The observations\nat high latitudes show unexplained structure in the 330 mbar levels. A notch in the zonal mean vertical\nozone profiles is evident for 65ON and an even more\n\'Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL pronounced notch appears at 4-10 mbar at 65\'s during\n32114\n2Remote Sensing Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Wash- ATLAS-1 (Figure la).

MAS, with -3 km vertical resolution,\nis able to examine this structure in some detail, (see\nFigs. 1 and 2). Now, in Perliski et al., the SBUV\nobservations did not follow the ozone recovery at all\nstratospheric levels predicted by the model (see their\nOzone Mixing Ratio (ppmv)\nFig. 5), but instead the observations show a continued\nFigure 2.

We see\nan even stronger structure (a notch) in the Antarctic\nboth in March 1992 (ATLAS-1, Fig. l a ) and in April\n1993 (ATLAS-2, Fig. lb).\nRecently Cheng et al. [I9951 reported long term\nground-based observations of stratospheric ozone from\nthe South Pole station. This group used a millimeterwave spectrometer t o measure thermal ozone emission\nfrom the atmosphere at -3-day intervals for 11 months.\nThese authors report a persistent double peak structure\nwhich is qualitatively similar to our notch; we emphasize the ozone minimum which is found at levels between\nabout 5 and 10 mbar, while they draw attention to the\nlower ozone peak near 50-55 mbar. It is reasonable to\nexpect some differences in the heights of these features\nbecause MAS observations are centered quite a distance\nfrom the pole (20\' to 30\xc2\xb00f latitude).\nCheng et al. attribute the minimum to continued\nphotochemical loss and the second (or lower) peak to\ntransport of air with higher ozone abundances into this\nregion. Thus their hypothesis has some similarity to the\ntransport role suggested by Park and Russell and supported by the HALOE observations. Meridional transport rates are expected to be both large and to have\nlarge vertical and meridional gradients at these altitudes in summer and fall at high southern latitudes, according to the GSFC 2-D stratospheric photochemistry\nmodel [ C . Jackman, personal communacation, 19951.\nThe model [Douglass et al. 1989 and Jackman et al.\n19901 has a 10\' latitudinal resolution, extending from\n85\'s t o 85ON and 46 levels equally spaced in log pressure, from the surface to 0.0024 mbar (approximately 2\nkm intervals, 0 t o 90 km). The model time step is 1 day.\nA residual circulation is calculated using a 4-year zonal\naverage of NMC temperatures. We have examined the\ncurrent output from this model and find that the notch\nstructure is well developed at 75\'s for April, when it is\nat its seasonal maximum. It is also apparent at 75ON\nfor November, but is only significant at 85ON in April.\nModel runs suggest that vertical structure in the meridional transport may play a dominant role in producing the notch. In this photochemical model, the notch\nstructure becomes more striking as one approaches the\npole, in both hemispheres near equinox. The model\nindicates that for latitudes poleward of about 65\' this\nnotch structure reaches its maximum in fall, decreases\nthroughout the winter, and is least pronounced in the\nspring.\n\nSummary\n\n231 1\n\nthat a common framework for understanding all of these\nmeasurements is possible.\nThese and similar observations will likely serve as useful tests of 3-D photochemical models in the future. In\naddition, the notch structure provides a quite useful\nphenomenon for measurement comparisons. Even remote sensing systems with moderate resolution should\nbe able to capture this vertical and horizontal structure.\nAcknowledgments.

The Millimeter-Wave Atmospheric Sounder\n(MAS) is a shuttle-based limb-sounding instrument designed for global spectroscopic studies of 03,and constituents important in O3 photochemistry, in the middle\natmosphere. It is part of the NASA\'s Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS) spacelab\nshuttle mission. This paper presents an overview of the\ninstrument, operation, and data analysis. In addition,\nas an example of the results, we present zonal average\nretrievals for 0 3 , HzO, and C/O obtained in ATLAS\n1. The MAS O3 and H 2 0 measurements are shown to\nagree well with simultaneous observations made with\nthe UARS MLS instrument.\n\nIntroduction\nSpace-based mm-wavespectroscopy in the limb-scanning mode is a powerful technique for study of the middle atmosphere.

Also, mm-wave spectrometers can achieve very\nhigh spectral resolution so that closely spaced or multiple lines can be resolved, and the effects of pressure\nbroadening can be exploited to increase the information\ncontent of the limb scan spectroscopic measurements.\nMAS is a shuttle-based, limb-scanning spectrometer\nwhich measures emissions from six mm-wave transitions\nof four molecular species: the rotational transitions of\nozone (03) at 184 GHz and water vapor (H20) at 183\nGHz; the 1-doubling multiplet of the chlorine monoxide\n(CIO) radical at 204 GHz; and three magnetic dipole\ntransitions of molecular oxygen (02) in the 55-65 GHz\ncomplex. From these measurements we deduce the\nabundance profiles of 03,H 2 0 , and temperature (20\nto 80 km), and ClO(20-45 km). MAS is part of the\nNASA ATLAS series of spacelab shuttle missions, and\nhas flown on ATLAS 1 (24 March - 2 April 1992), ATLAS 2 (8-17 April 1993), and ATLAS 3 (3-14 November\n1994). In this Letter we present an overview of the instrument and its operation, data analysis, and, as an\nexample of the results, we show zonal average measurements of 03, HzO, and C10 obtained during ATLAS\n1. We also compare the MAS ATLAS 1 O3 and H z 0\nmeasurements to those obtained simultaneously with\nthe UARS MLS instrument [Barath et al., 19931. More\ndetailed MAS measurements obtained in all three missions can be found in Hartmann et al. [this issue], Olivem et al. [this issue], Kriebel et al. [this issue], Aellig\net al.,a, b, [this issue], and Bevilacqua et al. [this issue].\n\nInstrumentation and 0bservations\nA detailed account of the MAS instrument characteristics and measurement capabilities has been published by Croskey et al. [1992]. Briefly, the sensor system consists of a 1-m off-axis paraboloid antenna and\nthree uncooled subharmonically pumped heterodyne radiometers at 60 GHz, 184 GHz, and 204 GHz. These\nfeed six separate multifilter spectrometers, each with a\ntotal bandwidth of 400 MHz and a maximum resolution of 2 or 0.2 MHz. The sensor is mounted on the left\nside of the ATLAS pallet and scans the atmospheric\nlimb perpendicular to the shuttle velocity vector. The\n\n: MAS\n\n\'\n\n03, HzO, AND CLO ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS\n\nnominal tangent altitude range is 10 to 120 km. The\nMAS data sampling interval is 40 ma, and each complete MAS measurement cycle, which includes an atmospheric measurement, a cold space calibration and\na hot calibration, is 12.8 s. The beamwidth of the. antenna ranga from 0.30\xc2\xb0 at 60 GHz to 0.15O at 204 GHz.\nFor the 300 km ATLAS orbit, this provides a vertical\ncross section at the tangent point of 4.7 km to 9.5 km.\nFor the ATLAS missions the shuttle orbits1 inclination was 57O. Atmospheric mea&r6ment;s were made\nin either the bay down/tail forward, or bay down/nose\nforward shuttle attitude. In the tail-forward orientation, MAS observes north of the orbital track and the\nmeasurement coverage is 73\' N to 41\xc2\xb0 S. In the nose\nforward orieatation MAS observes to the south, giving\na 4 i 0 N to 73O 9 mewurement range. During ATLAS\n1 the shuttle was deployed mainly in the tail-forward\nattitude so little data ww obtained poleward of 41\xc2\xb0 S.\nFurthermore, the ATLAS 1 launch time (1300) GMT\nwas such t h d most of the southern hemisphere w w on\nthe night side of the orbit. In ATLAS 2 the deployment\ntime in the two measurement orientations,was roughly\nequal, giving a more uniform coverage between 7 3 O N\nand 73O S. In ATLAS 3 MAS failed after ten hours of\nobservations. MI measurements were obtained in the\nsouth of\ntail-forward attitude, giving no obmervati~ns\n41\' S.\n\nData Acquisition and Analysis\nIn order to determine measurement tangent altitudes\nwe, use the MAS O2 meaurements. Two of the three\nO2 lines meamred by MAS have relatively small temperature sensitivity and can therefore be used to infer\natmospheric pressure. The pressure determination is\n.performed by matching the averaged measured brightnem temperatures ofthese two lines to radiative transfer\ncalculations in which the limb scan geometry, antenna\nbeam pattern, and spectrometer filter re8ponse curves\nare modeled [Lungen et al., 19941. The pressures are\nconverted to an approximate altitude scale using tem-\n\n9\n\n5\n\n9\n\n$\n\n"\n\n!\n\n2\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\nE\n\nLatItude <d@\n\nFigure Ib. Same as Figure la, but for HzO.\n\nperature/height profiles, obtained from the ~ a t i o bM e\nl\nteorolagical Center.\nBefore mixing ratio retrieval, we use radiance averaging to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Data are\nbinned into height intervals of 3 km for O3 and HaQ and\n6 km foz C10. In the 12.8 s measurement eycle, data\nfrom approximately seven 40 ms measurement intervals\nfall into each 3 km bin. The data are subsequently averaged either along the orbital traek (for example, in\ngroups of ten consecutive measurement cycles), or over\ngeographical intervals (for example, latitude Bones of\n5Oor loowidth, or regions near specific geographical locations). The .averaging method is chosen appropriate\nto the diurnal or geographical dependence being investigated.\nThe fundamental data products from MAS are the\nmixing ratio profiles of 03, Hz0 and CZO as a function\nof position and altitude. These profiles are retrieved\nfrom the spectral data using the optimal estimation inversion technique [see e.g., Rodgers, 19761. The procedure-includesuse of the pressure broadening of the\nO3 and H2O lines to infer atmospheric pressure and,\nthereby, determine the offset in elevation between the 60\nGHr antenna beam pattern and the 184 GHz pattern.\nThis offset is approximately O.OgO.

The retrievals were obtained by averaging the\nradiance data from the entire mission into 5 degree latitude bins. The total retrieval error is about 14%below\n30 krn (12 mb) decreasing to about 8% between 30 and\n60 km (12 - 0.2 mb) and increasing to about 35%above\nthis altitude. The contour plot shows features expected\nfrom 0 3 climatology [Keating and Young, 19851. Peak\nmixing ratios of just over 10 ppmv occur in the trop-\n\n: MAS\n\n03, H20, AND CLO ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENTS\n\nics at about 35 km where the O3 layer is very narrow.\nAt high latitudes the peak is broader with smaller amplitude. The increase in the O3 mixing ratio in the\nsouthern hemisphere mesosphere is the result of the O3\ndiurnal variation, because during ATLAS 1 the southern hemisphere was generally in the night portion of the\nshuttle orbit, and the northern hemisphere in the day\nportion. The mesospheric 0 3 diurnal variation observed\nby MAS during ATLAS 2 is discussed in Bevalacqua et\nal. [this issuej.\nThe zonal average H 2 0 distribution for ATLAS 1 is\nshown in Figure lb. The data show the expected increase in the water vapor mixing ratio with altitude in\nthe stratosphere, presumably resulting from methane\noxidation, and the decrease in the mixing ratio beginning in the lower mesosphere, caused by photodissociation [Le Texaer et al., 19881. In the upper mesosphere,\nin both hemispheres, there is also a large meridional\ngradient directed toward the equator. These results are\nconsistent with the mean meridional transport which,\nat equinox, is expected to be dominated by a 2-cell pattern with upward motion over the equator, poleward\nflow in the upper mesosphere, and downward motion\nover both poles [Holton and Schoeberl, 19881.\nThe MAS O3 measurements are compared to those\nmade with the other atmospheric instruments on board\nATLAS (ATMOS and SSBUV) in Kriebel et al. [this\nissue]. Also, detailed validation papers, in which the\nmeasurements are compared with the available data\nbase, for both O3 and H 2 0 , are in progress. As an\nexample of the results, in Figures 2a and 2b we compare the MAS ATLAS 1 zonal average O3 and Hz0\nmeasurements with those obtained simultaneously with\nthe UARS MLS instrument [Barath et al., 19931. The\nversion 3 MLS data used in these comparisons were\nobtained from the NASA Goddard Distributed Active\nArchive Center (DAAC), and the MAS results have\nbeen interpolated to the standard UARS pressure grid.\n\n23 15\n\n(MAS - MLS) / MLS H,O Difference [%I\nI\n\n-40\n\n-\n\n\'\n\n\'\n\nI\n\n-20\n\n\'\n\nn\n\n.\n\nI\n\n.\n\n.\n\n0\nLatitude [deg]\n\n.\n\n,\n\nl\n\n.\n\n\'\n\nl\n\n20\n\nFigure 2b.

The H 2 0 comparisons are carried out to the\n0.2 mb pressure level given as the lower pressure limit\nfor useful MLS H 2 0 version 3 data [DAAC, 19941. The\nMAS and MLS instruments are similar and observe the\nsame spectral lines. Thus there is a possibility that\nthey could share systematic errors, such as retrieval errors resulting from spectral line parameter uncertainties. However, in the mm-wave region, these errors are\nexpected to be small. Also, MLS is the only other currently operational instrument with the cability to make\nmeasurements over such an extended latitude range on\nshuttle mission time-scales. Unfortunately, MLS was in\nits southward looking mode during ATLAS 1, limiting\nthe region of MLS/MAS overlap to 40\xc2\xb0S to 30\xc2\xb0N.\nThe MAS/MLS O3 comparisons shown in Figure 2a\nare generally favorable, with the measurements agreeing to within the expected errors down to at least 30\nmb (M 23 km). However, there are systematic features\n(MAS MLS) / MLS 0,\nDifference\n-. evident in the comparison which may be significant.

We present measurements of the latitudinal\nvariation of nighttime O3 and H z 0 in the mesosphere\nand (for 03) lower thermosphere obtained with the\nMillimeter-wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS) instrument during the ATLAS 2 mission (8-15 April 1993).\nThese are the first such measurements that have ever\nbeen reported. They indicate an 0 3 mixing ratio minimum at mid-latitudes in the upper mesosphere, with\nmaxima in the tropics and at high latitudes. The H z 0\nretrievals indicate H 2 0 mixing ratios decreasing toward\nthe poles in both hemispheres in the upper mesosphere.\nWe also present measurements of the diurnal variation\nof O3 at southern mid-latitudes, at higher vertical resolution than has ever been reported previously. The\nresults are generally consistent with previous measurements and modeling studies.\n\nIntroduction\nMeasurements of mesospheric O3 and H 2 0 have historically been of great interest because of the important roles these species play in the chemistry and energetics of the mesosphere [Allen et al., 19841 and, in\nthe case of H 2 0 , as a tracer of atmospheric dynamics\n[Strobel et al., 19871. Regarding 0 3 , there has been a\nlong standing discrepancy between the models and the\nobservations (the "ozone deficit" [e.g., Siskind et al.,\n19951 ). Several studies [e.g.,Allen and Delitsky, 19931\nfound that this deficit is largest in the upper mesosphere\nwhere the odd hydrogen catalytic cycle dominates 0 3\nloss.

This technique requires many assumptions to be made about the kinetics\nof the metastable 0 2 and, thus, may contain inherently\nlarge systematic uncertainties [Mlynczalc and Olander,\n19951. It is also limited to daytime conditions. By contrast, millimeter-wave measurements are inherently of\nLTE emi\'ssions and can be made both day and night.\nRecently, Connor et al. [I9941 published an extensive\nset of mesospheric O3 measurements. However, those\ndata were ground-based and, thus, limited to a single\nlocation. Furthermore, they are of relatively low vertical resolution, and did not extend above 70 km.\nThe shuttlebased Millimeter-wave Atmospheric\nSounder (MAS) instrument (see e.g., Croskey et al.\n[1992]; Hartmann et a1. [this issue]) is part of the NASA\nATLAS series of spacelab missions. MAS observes the\nO3 line at 184 GHz, as well as the H z 0 line at 183 GHz,\nat high spectral resolution (200 kHz), allowing simultaneous retrievals of these two constituents extending into\nthe upper part of the middle atmosphere.\nIn this Letter we present MAS mesospheric and lower\nthermospheric O3 and H z 0 retrievals obtained during\nthe ATLAS 2 mission (8-15 April 1993), which gave\nthe largest nighttime latitudinal coverage of the three\nATLAS missions. We concentrate on nighttime measurements because the large mesospheric knhancement\nof O3 at night allows retrievals to be made up to 92 km\n(see Figure la), whereas in the daytime the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) becomes very small above 75 km. We\nshow the first near-global measurements of the nighttime latitudinal structure of O3 in the mesosphere.

Below about\n60 km the variation is of opposite phase, with maxima\nat mid-latitudes. However, the amplitude of this lower\nmesospheric feature is quite small (20%) compared to\nthe upper mesospheric variation. Above about 85 km\nthe latitudinal variation is dominated by large mixing\nratios at the high latitude southern hemisphere.\nIn Figure 3b, we show the H 2 0 retrievals obtained\nsimultaneously with the O3 retrievals discussed above.\nThe contour plot shows a clear maximum in the upper\nmesosphere in the tropics, with mixing ratios falling\noff toward the poles in both hemispheres. Above 70\nkm, the gradient is approximately a factor of 2. Near\nthe stratopause there is very little structure between\nthe tropics and 35\'s. However, between 35\'s and 65\'s\nthe gradient is reversed from that obtained in the u p\nper mesosphere, with mixing ratios increasing toward\nthe pole by less than 20%. The latitudinal distribution\nof H 2 0 shown in Figure 3b is consistent with the upwelling over the tropics and subsidence over both poles\n\nNighttime Water Vapor\n\nSatellite based observations, such as those presented\nin this study, are not ideal for studying diurnal variations, because day and night profiles at the same latitude are obtained, in general, on opposite sides of the\nearth. Therefore, longitudinal variations are convolved\nwith temporal variations. Nevertheless, because of the\nhigh vertical resolution and large altitude range of the\npresent measurements, it may still be instructive to examine night-day differences. In order to examine the\nO3 diurnal variation, we concentrate on southern midlatitudes because, in this region, the integration times\nin the day and night spectra are approximately the\nsame. In Figure 4, we plot the average day and night\nO3 retrievals for the 55\'s latitude bin. The approximately 10% difference in the profiles in the stratosphere\n(where no diurnal variation is expected) is indicative of\nthe magnitude of longitudinal variations present in this\ncomparison. However, above 50 km differences much\nlarger than 10% become apparent, which are presumably the result of the O3 diurnal variation. In the mesosphere, the day profile decreases very rapidly to mixing\nratios less than 0.5 ppmv above 60 km. However, in the\nnight retrieval there is an enhancement of O3 in the midmesosphere. The different characteristics of the two\nprofiles produce a maximum mesospheric mixing ratio\ndifference of about 1.0 ppmv above about 65 km. These\ndifferences then begin to decrease up to the daytime\ndetection limit of 75 km. The nighttime enhancement\n120\n\n0\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n0\nLatitude [deg]\n\n20\n\nFigure 3b.

This latitudinal variation\nmay be the result of the two competing effects which\nare thought to control O3 abundances in this altitude\nregion: solar zenith angle, which controls O3 production, and water vapor, which controls O3 loss. Tlie solar zenith angle effect tends to decrease 0 3 abundances\nwith increasing latitude, whereas the H z 0 abundance\n(which is shown to decrease with latitude in this altitude region) tends to increase 03.\nWe also present unique high vertical resolution measurements of the diurnal variation of 0 3 at southern\nmid-latitudes. The results are qualitatively consistent\nwith those obtained in the measurement study of Connor et al. 119941 and the modeling study of Allen et al.\n[1984]. A significant feature of these measurements is\nthe region of decreasing O3 night-day differences with\naltitude from 65 to 75 km, implying decreasing daytime atomic oxygen densities over this altitude range.\nIn future work, the measurements presented in this Letter (both the latitudinal and diurnal variations) will be\ncompared with detailed 0 3 photochemical model calculations obtained with the NRL 1- and 2-D models.\n\nReferences\nAllen, M., J.I.

Latitudinal distributions of upper stratospheric C10 measured by MAS during the three ATLAS missions are presented for northern hemisphere\n(NH) spring equinox in 1992, southern hemisphere (SH)\nearly fall in 1993, and NH fall in 1994. The MAS C10\nresults are shown along with correlative MLS observations. The results of both instruments consistently show\nthe same latitudinal features. The C10 maximum in the\nNH spring occurs at mid latitudes, whereas the latitudinal C10 maximum in both the NH and SH fall occurs at\nhigh latitudes. The volume mixing ratio maxima were\nsignificantly higher in the fall (0.7-0.8 ppbv) than in\nspring (0.5-0.6 ppbv) . Qualitatively, these results are\nconsistent with calculations of several 2-D models.\n\nIntroduction\nChlorine monoxide (C10) is the predominant form of\nreactive chlorine in the stratosphere. Knowledge of the\nstratospheric C10 distribution, and an understanding of\nits chemistry, are of great interest because C10 is a key\nconstituent in ozone (03) depletion. The large spring3\ntime loss of lower stratospheric 0 over Antarctica is\nlargely driven by a chlorine catalytic cycle in which the\nformation of the C10 dimer (C1202) is the rate limiting\nstep [Molina and Molina, 19871. The C10 abundance\nis also important in controlling the 0 distribution in\n3\nthe upper stratosphere, where it participates in a catalytic cycle that destroys 0 very effectively [Molina\n3\nand Rowland, 19741.\nBecause of interest in the ozone hole and polar 03\ndepletion in general, there has been a great deal published over the past few years about the distributions\nof enhanced C10 in the lower stratosphere during pho-\n\n\'Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC.\nZGeorgeMason University, Fairfax, VA.\n3Universityof Berne, Switzerland.\n4Forrnerly, University of Berne, Switzerland.\nSMaxPlanck Institute for Aeronomy, Lindau, Germany\n6University of Bremen, Germany.\n\'Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL.\n8Pe~sylvania\nState University, State College, PA.\n9Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA.\n\'qarvard University, Cambridge, MA.\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GLO 1215\n0094-8534196196GL-01215$05.00\n\n*:(\n\nI\n\n\' \' - \\ \\ \' I ,\n\n*\n\n"1\n\n.\n)\n\n%\n\ni\n\ntochemically perturbed conditions. These studies have\nused ground-based [e.g. de Zafra et al., 19891, air-borne\nin-situ [e.g. Anderson et al., 19911, or space-based [e.g.\nSantee et al., 19951 measurements. However, less has\nbeen published [e.g. Crewell et al., 19951 on the latitudinal distribution of C10 in the upper stratosphere.\nUncertainties regarding Cly partitioning [Michelsen et\nal., this issue] can be addressed by such upper stratospheric observational studies in conjunction with HC1\nand CH4 measurements [Solomon and Garcia, 19841.\nIn this paper we present measurements of the vertical and latitudinal distribution of C10 measured by the\nMillimeter-wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS) [Croskey\net al., 19921, with special emphasis on the C10 abundance in the upper stratosphere in the vicinity of the\nmixing ratio peak. MAS is part of the NASA Atmospheric Laboratory for Application and Science (ATLAS) spacelab shuttle mission. Stratospheric C10 measurements obtained from 24 March-2 April 1992 (ATLAS I), from 8-17 April 1993 (ATLAS 2), and from\n3-4 November 1994 (ATLAS 3) are presented along\nwith correlative observations from the Microwave Limb\nSounder (MLS).\n\nMAS C10 Observations and Analysis\nThe signal strength of the upper stratospheric C10\nemission line at 204 GHz is very weak and provides\ndouble side band (DSB) brightness temperature amplitudes of the order of only 0.5 K for limb sounding observations. To reduce the effect of measurement noise on\nthe retrieved C10 profiles, extensive radiance averaging\nof about 1000 s per retrieval were performed [Aellig et\nal., 19931. C10 also exhibits a distinct diurnal variation,\nwhich is especially pronounced at pressures higher than\nabout 5 mb where virtually all C10 reacts with NO2\nto form C10N02 at night [KO and Sze, 19841. Therefore, only daytime C10 spectra with solar hour angles\n(SHA) between -60\' and +60\xc2\xb0 were used for the C10\nretrievals.\nThe measured radiances were first binned in latitude\nbands of ten degrees on a pressure grid between 80 and\n1 mb, using 30 grid points vertically spaced at approximately 1 km. (Pressure was provided by simultaneous\nmeasurements of 0 2 lines near 60 GHz [Langen et al.,\n19941.) These spectra are affected by blending of lines\nfrom other species, which increases with pressure. In\nthe ATLAS 1 and 2 measurements, there are also persistent instrumental baseline artifacts over the entire\npressure range. (The long term baseline stability, how-\n\n2322\n\nAELLIG E T AL.: LATITUDINAL DISTRIBUTION O F STRATOSPHERIC CLO\n\never, was for all missions generally less than 0.05 K,\nwhich is approximately 10 % of the DSB amplitude.)\nTherefore, in order to minimize retrieval error resulting\nfrom the atmospheric and instrumental baseline, in the\nATLAS 1 and 2 retrievals, nighttime (11 p.m.- 4 a.m.)\nmeasurements (binned on the same pressure grid) have\nbeen subtracted from the daytime spectra over the entire pressure range. Prior to ATLAS 3, the C10 receiver\nwas replaced, significantly reducing the instrumental\nbaseline compared to that obtained in the two previous missions. Therefore, in the ATLAS 3 retrievals,\nthe day-night spectral subtraction was performed only\nat pressures higher than 5 mb. The approach used in\nthe ATLAS 3 retrievals is appropriate, and causes little retrieval bias because there is virtually no C10 at\npressures higher than 5 mb at night, according to theory [KO and Sze, 19841. Above 5 mb, however, nighttime C10 becomes increasingly abundant. Therefore,\nthe day-night subtraction does produce a significant\nretrieval bias in the ATLAS 1 and 2 retrievals above\n5 mb. This bias is constant with latitude for each mission because the same night spectra were used for all\nlatitudes. C10 mixing ratios were retrieved from these\naveraged and differenced spectra on six layers, each of\na thickness of about 6 km, using an optimal estimation\napproach described in Aellig et al. [1993]. To account\nfor the bias in the ATLAS 1 and 2 retrievals introduced\nby the difference of day and night spectra, estimated\nC10 night profiles were then added to the ATLAS 1\nand 2 retrievals. Using correlative Atmospheric Trace\nMolecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment measurements [Gunson et al., this issue] as constraints, C10\nnight time estimates were derived from 1-dimensional\nphotochemical model calculations.\n\n:\n\nModel night -\n\n- - Airborne\n\nI\n\n0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60\nCIO volume mixing ratio [ppbv]\n\nFigure 1.

MLS\nresults represent the range of C10 monthly means averaged between 20 and 40 N [Waters et al., 19961.\n\nValidation of MAS Observations\nAs a part of the MAS validation campaign, correlative airborne measurements of C10 at 649 GHz were\nperformed during ATLAS 1 by the Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy and by the University of Bremen.\nA description of the sub-mm instrument used and the\nresults of earlier measurements can be found in Wehr\net al. [1995]. A comparison of MAS and airborne C10\nprofiles obtained at similar latitudes is shown in Figure 1. The two profiles are in good agreement within\nthe error bars ( l a ) , which represent the total retrieval\nerrors. The estimated retrieval precision of MAS C10 is\nof the order of 0.05 parts per billion by volume (ppbv)\nat the C10 vmr peak, which is significantly better than\nthe total retrieval error.\nComparisons of MAS C10 with MLS C10 version 3\nclimatology were also performed. (An error in the data\nprocessing caused the MLS C10 version 3 retrievals to\nbe too large by 8%. Thus, these retrievals need to be\nmultiplied by 0.92 to correct for this systematic error.\nThis correction was made for all MLS C10 version 3\ndata shown in this Letter. The estimated MLS C10 version 3 bias uncertainties are 0.15-0.2 ppbv (2~7) the\nand\nestimated scaling error is 15-20 % (2u). See Waters et\nal. [I9961for validation of the MLS C10 version 3 data.)\nAs pointed out by Waters et al. [1996], zonal averages\ni the region between 20 N and 40 N are meaningful for\nn\ncomparisons because the seasonal variation is small in\nthis latitude band. We therefore compared MAS data\naveraged on the same or on similar latitude bands with\nMLS monthly means. It can be seen in Figure 2 that the\nMAS C10 measurements for all missions are generally\nwithin the range of the MLS measurements.\n\nC10 Latitudinal Distributions\nFigure 3 is a contour plot of northern hemisphere C10\nzonal mean volume mixing ratios (vmr) measured by\nMAS (a) along with MLS (b) results, both taken within\n\nAELLIG E T AL.: LATITUDINAL DISTRIBUTION O F STRATOSPHERIC CLO\n\n2323\n\n1\n\na) MAS CIO [ppbv]\n\n8Pf: : $!\n\nA\n\n-8 I\n\n-I$ -88 -88 -18 1\n\n: b) MLS CIO [ppbv]\n\n8Pfi\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n-60\n\nlatitude [deg]\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\nlatitude [deg]\n\nFigure 3 a) MAS ATLAS 1 C10 distributions in P P ~ V Figure 4.

The reaction CHI\nverts reactive chlorine (C1 C10 = Cl,) into the inert\nHC1. In the winter polar region, however, the reduced\nconversion of C1, into HCl is expected to be balanced\nby the slow production of C1, from all chlorine reservoir gases (HC1, C10N02, and HOCl), resulting from\nthe lack of sunlight.\nA compilation of 2-dimensional model calculations\nof the stratospheric C10 distribution was published by\nJackman et al.

The\nAER and GSFC2 model results in Jackman et al. in\nparticular exhibit higher C10 distributions in the SH\nfall than in the NH spring, in agreement with the MAS\nand MLS measurements.

In the lower stratosphere, the observations show enhanced H 2 0 inside the vortex between\n450 K and 625 K, in agreement with other H z 0 observations. In the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere,\nat potential temperatures between 1850 K and 2200 K,\nwe find regions of depressed H 2 0 volume mixing ratio coincident with remnants of high potential vorticity. The depressed mesospheric HzO, as well as the\nenhanced lower stratospheric H 2 0 , are consistent with\nwintertime descent. It also suggests effective containment of air up into the lower mesosphere.\n\nIntroduction\nSeveral detailed studies have recently been published\non the motion of air through the stratospheric polar\nvortex [e.g. Bacmeister et al., 1995; Fisher et al., 19931.\nThey describe the classical picture of poleward motion\nof winter mesospheric air and subsequent descent into\nthe polar vortex. However, as discussed by Randel\n[1993], significant controversy remains regarding the degree of isolation of vortex air, and descent rates and\npatterns in the vortex. Several recent studies (as well\nas this Letter) deal specifically with the development\nof the stratospheric 1991/92 Arctic vortex [e.g. Rosenfield et al., 1994; Lahoz et al., 19941. The dynamics\nof the high latitude winter and spring mesosphere has\nbeen less well studied. Previous observations, e.g. the\nHALOE NO results presented by Siskind and Russell\n[1996], have shown descent of upper atmospheric air\ninto the stratosphere. However, to our knowledge, the\nsignature of this descent within the mesosphere has not\n\n\'Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC.\nGeorge Mason University, Fairfax, VA.\n3C~mputationa1\nPhysics, Inc., Fairfax, VA.\n4University of Berne, Switrcerland.\n5European Space Agency, Nordwijk, Netherlands.\n6 ~ a Planck Institute for Aeronomy, Lindau, Germany.\nx\n7University of Bremen, Germany.\n\'NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA.\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GL01571\n0094-8534196196GL-01571$05.00\n\nI\n\n\'\n\n\'\nj\n\n!,\n,\n\n:n\n\n<\n\n<?\n\n,J\n\nbeen reported. Furthermore, the containment properties of the winter mesosphere are not well understood.\nThe Millimeter-wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS)\nexperiment is part of the NASA ATLAS mission, and\nhas flown on ATLAS 1 (3/24/92-4/2/92), ATLAS 2\n(4/8/93-4/17/93), and ATLAS 3 (1113194-11/4/94).\nOne noteworthy feature of MAS is that it measures the\n183 GHz HzO spectral line (as well as ozone at 184 GHz)\nat high spectral resolution (200 kHz). These high spectral resolution measurements enable the H z 0 profiles\nto be retrieved up to 80 km [Bevilacqua et al., this issue]. The high altitude retrieval capability is significant\nbecause, in addition to its well documented usefulness\nas a tracer of vertical motions in the stratosphere, H z 0\nhas also been shown to be well suited for this purpose\nin the mesosphere [e.g. Bevilacqua et al., 19901. In this\nLetter, we examine the MAS stratospheric and mesospheric H z 0 measurements made during the ATLAS 1\nmission in the vicinity of the dissipating Arctic vortex.\n\nDynamical State of the Arctic Vortex\nDuring ATLAS 1\nComputations of potential vorticity (pv) on levels of\npotential temperature (O)\nbetween 450 and 2200 K have\nbeen made for the days of our Hz0 observations using\nthe Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) pv analysis\nroutines [Newman et al., 19881. These analyses show\nthat the Arctic vortex was in advanced stages of dissipation at the end of March 1992. The vortex was\nintact, although weak, between about 500 and 800 K\nby March 25. The dissipation then rapidly progressed\ndownward from the upper boundary, and was evident\nas low as the 700 K level on March 27. This dissipation\nfrom the upper stratosphere downward is typical of late\nwinterlearly spring conditions and has been reported by\nManney et al. [1994]. Thus, during the ATLAS 1 mission, an intact, though weak, vortex was present only\nbetween approximately 500 K and 650 K.\nIn order to illustrate the stratospheric meteorological\nsituation during ATLAS 1 in more detail, in Figure 1\nwe present contours of pv on 27 March for the lower\nstratosphere (la), the mid stratosphere (lb), and upper\nstratosphere/lower mesosphere (lc). At 600 K, a coherent area of high pv can be seen over Siberia. At this\nlevel, the region of maximum winds (40 m/s) is coincident with the region of steep pv gradients, which indicates that the vortex was still in an intact configuration.\nIn the mid stratosphere and upper stratosphere/lower\n\nAELLIG E T AL.: ARCTIC STRATOSPHERIC AND MESOSPHERIC HzO\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.3\n\n6.0\n\n6.5\n\n7.0\n\n7.5\n\n8.0\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFigure 1 Potential vorticity [10\'SKm2kg-1s-1] for 27 March 1992 as derived from the NMC analysis for the\n.\n(a) 600 K, (b) 1300 K, and (c) 2100 K 0-levels.

As mentioned earlier, although\nno vortex is expected at these altitudes at this time of\nthe year, there is a region of high pv centered over East\nSiberia. We find depressed Hz0 values in good congruence with this region of high pv. The relatively low\nHz0 values may be indicative of descent at the 2100 K\nsurface, because this level is above the HzO vmr peak\nat winter high latitudes (see Figure 2). Thus, the HzO\nobservations provide evidence that the region of high pv\nat this level may be a vortex remnant.\not . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nIn order to examine more closely the relationship be-1.\nO\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.\nO\ntween H 2 0 vmr and pv, in Figure 3 we present scatter\nCorrelation Coefficient [I]\nplots of H z 0 vmr and pv for the same 0-surfaces used\nin Figure 1. ln the plots we use the 115 MAS ATLAS 1 Figure 4.

Although no pv analysis is available above\napproximately 2200%, regions of depressed H 2 0 are evident a t least u p t o 3000 K (Figure 2). Again, we believe\nthat this significant anticorrelation may be the residual effects of descent and containment of mesospheric\nair which occurred within the vortex during the winter.\nThis is consistent with the vortex analyses by Bacmeister et al. [I9951 and Fisher et al. [1993], which suggest\nmesospheric descent into the stratospheric polar vortex. Evidence of containment in the mid to high latitude winter mesosphere is also given in model studies.\n2-D models [e.g. Garcia et al. 19921 incorporating planetary wave parametrization suggest low values of Kyy\n(meridional mixing coefficient) on the poleward flank of\nthe mesospheric polar night jet. This finding implies\na certain degree of isolation in the polar winter mesosphere and is consistent with our pv/HzO correlation\nanalysis.\nIn order to summarize the H20/pv regression analysis discussed above, in Figure 4, we plot r as a function\nof O. It shows strong correlation in the 450 K to 625 K\nregion, strong anticorrelation above 1850 K, and a transition region between the two regimes between 800 K\nand 1700 K. As a check on the MAS observations, we\nhave also performed a linear regression analysis between\npv and the HALOE HzO data. The HALOE profile\ngenerally shows the same basic features as the MAS\nprofile displayed in Figure 4, with positive H20/pv correlation in the lower stratosphere, no correlation in the\nmid stratosphere, and negative correlation in the upper\nstratosphere/lower mesosphere. Differences are evident,\nhowever, in the vertical extent of the region with high\ncorrelation, and in the degree of the correlation. In particular, the region of transition from positive to negative\ncorrelation occurs at a higher altitude in the HALOE\ndata than in the MAS data. Since the transition is expected t o correspond roughly to the altitude of the vmr\npeak, this may be consistent with the fact that (at high\nlatitudes) there is a disagreement between HALOE and\nMAS HzO data in the altitude of the vmr peak, with\nthe HALOE peak generally several km higher than that\nobtained in the MAS data.\n\n-\n\nConclusions\nThe major finding of this paper is the evidence of\ndescent in the upper stratosphere/lower mesosphere\n(1850 K-2200 K) that was observed in the MAS HzO\nmeasurements within a vortex remnant. This suggests\nthat effective vortex containment may extend well into\nthe mesosphere. Although the high altitude portion\nof the stratospheric vortex had dissipated in the weeks\nprior to the MAS observations presented in this Letter, the vortical descent signature had evidently not yet\nbeen completely dissipated by the horizontal mixing occurring subsequent to the vortex break up. Previous\n\nobservations, e.g. the HALOE NO results presented by\nSiskind and Russell [1996], have shown descent of upper\natmospheric air into the stratosphere. However, to our\nknowledge, the signature of descent within the mesosphere has not been reported.\nAcknowledgments.

Instead\nof one doppler and pressure broadened 0 2 line (Voigt\nline shape), we record a combination of 57 such lines,\nwhere the conibinatioli depends on tlle observing geonletry. This scale of splitting cannot be resolved in the\nMAS Brightness Temperature spectra by the 2OOkHz\nMAS filters, and is not indicated in figure 1, but the\nresulting envelope of their combination can be detected\nwith sufficient resolution. Characteristic of this envelope is a region symmetric about the 9+ line center.\nThere the form can be convex (part I) or concave (part\n11), but the width of the region remains constant over\nthe range of tangent heights at a given location, a ~ i d\ntlie width varies with the total magnetic field. This\nis apparently the effect of the at and a- Zeelnann\ncoinponents, for wliicli the maxilnuln amplitude is expected for lnaxilnum frequency offset, and theory predicts tlie width to be directly proportional t o the total\nfield. Thus, comparing the central portions of the spect r a in tlie cases I1 and I of figure 1, these are in the\nexpected ratio of 2.5.\nTo further verify tlie observation of Zeeman splitting, additional ZPNI inodel calculatioiis were carried\nout for vertical linear polarization (VL).

The concave shape of the envelope from the\nmodel calculatioils is also visible in tlie data.

Figure 3 shows the width\nvariation with I G R F field for these data. Individual\npoints represent 12.8 seconds of d a t a for the tangent\nheight interval 78.5 to 81.5 km. From the theory it is\nexpected that the width equals 0.05 x B, where B, is\nthe total magnetic strength; these results can be summarized as width 0.05 x B,. In addition to the spread\ndue t o noise there is a bias, for which one suggestion is\nregions reduces\nthat 0 2 line interference in overlappi~~g\nand\nthe signal [Rose~~krunz Staelin, 19881. We exploit\nthe concave shape of the envelope t o estimate the width\nas the frequency separation of the strongest expected\nZeeman components, which are also t h e furthest comnponents either side of line center. Our procedure minimizes Doppler Broadening influence but tends t o underestimate the width somewhat. Another suggestion\nfor the bias is that the IGRF model overestimates the\nfield strength a t these altitudes. To test that liypothesis versus estimation bias, one must employ a detailed\nmodel such as ZPM.\nAs a further comment, simple limb viewing radiative\ntransfer arguments suggest that the ambient temperature at about 80 k m can be estimated directly using the\n9+ 0 2 line, divided by the sideband ratio of the receiver,\nwhich is about 0.5. If one were t o measure simultaneously the 1- line (118.7503 GHz), one could also estimate the ambient temperature a t about 95 km. Likewise, if one also measures t h e 25+ line (65.7648 GHz),\none could have an estimate of the ambient temperature\na t about 60 km. Figure 4 summarizes the idea, using\nthe same ZPM results as in figure 1.\nThe brightness temperature a t the line center for the\n39+ line (69.49 GHz) the 29+ line (66.83 GHz), the 19+\n\n<\n\nWe have made use of the relatively high frequency\nresolution of the MAS radiometerspectrometer [Hartmann et al., 1985; Hartrnann, 1988; Cmskey et al.,\n1992; NASA, 19931 (the 200 kHz filters are a factor of\n10 higher in resolution than microwave spectron~eters\nhitherto used in space applications) t o verify Zee~rlan\neffect model calculations for the 0 2 molecule above 70\nkm.

The ATMOS Fourier transform spectrometer was\nflown for a fourth time on the Space Shuttle as part of the\nATLAS-3 instrument payload in November 1994. More than\n190 sunrise and sunset occultation events provided\nmeasurements of more than 30 atmospheric trace gases at\nlatitudes 3 - 49"N and 65 - 72"S, including observations both\ninside and outside the Antarctic uolar vortex. The instrument\nconfiguration, data retrieval methodology, and mission\nbackground are described to place in context analyses of\nATMOS data presented in this issue.\nATMOS Instrument\nThe Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS)\nproject was initiated in the 1970s, when the central scientific\nobjectives were to extend our base knowledge of the infrared\nspectral response of the stratosphere, measure nearly\nsimultaneously the vertical profiles of many atmospheric\nconstituents on a global scale, determine seasonal and annual\nvariations in atmospheric composition, and quantify the\ncatalytic cycles and other processes controlling ozone\ndepletion. This goal led to the ATMOS instrument, a Fourier\ntransform spectrometer first flown as part of the Spacelab 3\n(SL-3) Space Shuttle payload in 1985. The current instrument\nremains essentially as described by Farmer [1987].\nATMOS was designed for operation in solar occultation\nmode, acquiring high-resolution, infrared solar absorption\nspectra of the Earth limb during orbital sunrises and sunsets.\nIn a typical 4 minute observation period, close to 100 spectra\nare obtained with an apodized resolution of -0.01 cm". In\nlow Earth orbit (-300 km) from the Space Shuttle, the height\nspacing between successive ATMOS spectra varies between 4\nkm to less than 1 km at tangent heights in the troposphere,\nwith typical values of -2 km at tangent heights through the\n\n\' ~ e Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology,\nt\nPasadena, CA.\n2~~~~\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL.\n3 ~ ~NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA.\n1 ~ ,\n4~alifornia\nInstitute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.\n\'~epartmentof Physics, University of Denver, Denver, CO.\n\'Institute of Astrophysics, Univ. of LiBge, LiBge-Cointe, Belgium.\n7 ~ a ~ aUniversity, Cambridge, MA.\nrd\n\'university of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL.\n%ASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA.\n\'OIMK, Forschungszentru~nKarlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany.\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GL01569\n0094-8534/96/96GL-0 1569$05.00\n\nstratosphere. The projection of the instrument field-of-view\n(1 - 2.8 mrad) at the tangent point limits the effective vertical\nresolution in retrieved profiles to 4 km. The signal-to-noise\nratios of the resulting spectra are in the range 250 to 100:1,\ndepending on the optical bandpass filter used to select\nspectral regions between 600 - 4750 cm-I (16.6 - 2.1 microns).\nUp to eight different optical filters were carried on each flight,\nwith some changed between flights to extend the multiple\nspecies measurement within individual observations, while\npreserving the signal-to-noise ratio of the resulting spectra.\nAbrams et al. [this issue (a)] discuss the estimated precision\nreported with the ATMOS vertical profiles and compare these\nwith the standard deviation of the mean of several profiles\nobtained at low latitudes. The altitude range over which\nATMOS profiles are reported, together with a general guide to\nthe precisions achieved for each gas are shown in Figure 1.\nThe upper altitudes coincide with the first appearance of\nabsorption features of a particular gas that vary slightly\nbetween successive occultations. The lower altitude limit is\ndetermined by a combination of factors: rapid increase in\nopacity through the troposphere, aerosols and cloud tops\nobscuring the sun, lack of accuracy in assigning tangent\nheights and pressures to individual spectra, and the difficulty\nin retrieving stratospheric constituent volume mixing ratios\n(vrnrs) below their peak concentrations. Issues limiting the\nlower altitude range will be addressed in future analyses.\nThe data processing and inversion methods employed with\nthe ATMOS data follow those described by Norton and\nRinsland [1991]. As some changes have been incorporated to\nenhance routine data processing and to distinguish between\nthis current dataset and previous published analyses, the\nATMOS data utilized in the papers in this issue have been\nascribed to \'Version 2\'. In brief, after transformation of the\ninterferograms to power spectra, an average exoatmospheric\nspectrum is formed for each occultation against which ratios\nare made with successive atmospheric spectra. The resulting\natmospheric transmission spectra are essentially free of solar\nand instrumental spectral features. The inversion of these\ntransmission spectra follows a general sequence: assignment\nof a first-guess tangent height based on spacecraft ephemeris\ndata, refinement of the tangent height (or more correctly,\ntangent pressure) from spectral fitting to the observed C02\nabsorption bands [Abrams et al., 19961, and retrieval of\natmospheric temperature-pressure profiles [Stiller et al.,\n19951, followed by a final tangent pressure assignment.\nRetrievals of vmr profiles for individual species use spectral\nintervals that are chosen based on the shape and strength of\ntarget gas absorption, the insensitivity of these features to\nerrors in temperature, and their relative freedom from\ninterfering absorption from other constituents [e.g., Gunson\n\n-\n\nGUNSON ET AL.: THE ATMOSPHERIC TRACE MOLECULE EXPERIMENT (ATMOS)\net al., 19901. The ATMOS spectral linelist and associated\nspectroscopic uncertainties (leading to systematic uncertainties in the vmrs) are discussed in Brown et al. [1996].\nATMOS and ATLAS\n\nThe results from the 1985 SL-3 deployment have been\nextensively reported in the literature, and have demonstrated\nthe potential for high-resolution, infrared solar occultation\nobservations to measure the vertical profiles of more than\nthirty atmospheric trace gases. Included in this dataset were\nmeasurements of vertical profiles of trace gases in the\nstratosphere not measured previously [e.g., N205, Toon et al.,\n1986; C10N02, Zander et al., 1986; HO2NO2,Rinsland et al.,\n1986a; CH3Cl, Park et al., 1986; COF2, Rinsland et al.,\n1986b, SF6, Rinsland et a]., 19901, which, combined with the\nmeasured vertical profiles of other trace constituents,\nprovided opportunities to critically evaluate aspects of our\nunderstanding of the photochemistry of the upper\nstratosphere [e.g., McElroy and Salawitch, 1989; Allen and\nDelitsky, 1990; Natarajan and Callis, 19911. The absorption\nfeatures of several gases were discernible well above heights\nin the stratosphere, providing information for analyses on the\ncomposition of the mesosphere and thermosphere [Kumar et\nal., 1995; Lopez-Puertas et al., 19921.\nThe operational success of ATMOS was realized over the\nthree flights of the 1992-1994 ATLAS series (AT-1, AT-2, and\nAT-3). Together, these missions provided observations of\nvertical profiles of atmospheric constituents throughout the\ntropics and mid-latitudes, in both hemispheres and over two\nseasons (Figure 2). In addition, ATMOS obtained measurements inside and outside the Arctic polar vortex during AT-2,\nand sampled inside and outside the Antarctic vortex in AT-3.\nThe early November mission of AT-3 provided the first\nopportunity to obtain space-based measurements on the\nchemical and dynamical state of the Antarctic vortex with the\nbreadth of species and measurement precision provided by\n\nATMOS, comparing conditions inside and outside the region\nof maximum ozone loss that had occurred in the preceding\nmonths. Manney et al. [this issue] discuss meteorological\nconditions relevant to ATMOS observations during AT-3.\nRinsland et al. [this issue (a,b)] have used the ability of\nATMOS to measure the components of the family of reactive\nnitrogen species as well as H20 and CH4, to show that the\nlevel of denitrification wjthin the vortex through formation\nand sedimentation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs)\noccurs at a slightly higher altitude of -20 km than the\nmaximum level of dehydration (as measured by H20 +\n2xCH4), which appears at -18 km altitudes. Near 25 km, the\nlong-lived tracers N20 and CH4 are measured with vmrs\nequivalent to those found at -50 km [Abrams et al., this issue\n(b)]. This air brings higher levels of inorganic chlorine (HCl\n+ C10N02 + ClO), which, by the time of the AT-3 mission, has\nbeen converted mainly to HCl under the low ozone levels in\nthe vortex, which lead also to higher vmrs of NO [Rinsland et\nal., this issue (a)]. In contrast, measurements obtained by\nATMOS during AT-2 through the Arctic vortex in April 1993\nshow similar descent rates but, because of the shorter descent\nperiod, less total descent [Abrams et al., this issue (c)].\nThe conditions within the polar vortices can be viewed as\nperturbed relative to the typical conditions encountered at\nmid-latitudes or within the tropics. However, detailed model\nstudies of mid-latitude ATMOS observations of chlorine sink\nand reservoir species reveal a deficit in the computed levels of\nHCl that can be reconciled if an additional source of\nstratospheric HCl production, such as C10 + OH + HCl + 02,\nis allowed [Michelsen et al., this issue]. The internal\nconsistency of the ATMOS halogen measurements has been\nevaluated previously by Zander et al. [I9921 by comparing\nthe altitude variation of the total chlorine-atom content from\nall measured species, which includes not only the major sink\nand reservoirs, but also most of the major source gases. This\nanalysis is extended using the AT-3 measurements from\nATMOS [Zander et al., this issue (a)] and MAS (Millimeter\n\nError Estimate\ni 20%\n>\n1 10-20%\n\n1 5-10%\n1 <5%\n\n0\n\n&\ni\ni\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n.. ... . ...\n... .... ... .. .\n\n.a\nmm..\n.mm.m\n\nmu.\n..m\n\na\n\n8\n\nu\n\nn\n\n.I=I\n.\n\n.a\nm.\n\nI..\n.

[1994],\nthe measured upper stratospheric HC1 and HF from all four\nshuttle flights are shown in Figure 3. The roughly 9.5 year\ninterval between the first and latest deployment is\nsufficiently long to allow significant trends to be discernible\nnot only in total chlorine and fluorine loading, but also in\nmany individual species [Rinsland et al., this issue (c);\nZander et al., this issue (b)].\nThe broad range of species measured at the precision and\naccuracy achieved by ATMOS over a long time base of\nobservations provides correlative measurements with satellite\ninstruments such as those on the Upper Atmospheric Research\nSatellite [see special issue, J. Geophys. Res., 101, No. D6,\n19961. Relating broad but global space-based observations\nto the detailed measurements made by in situ sensors carried\non research aircraft has not always been possible. Chang et\na[. [this issue, (a,b)] explore inter-comparisons of ATMOS\nmeasurements at northern mid-latitudes with those made by\ninstruments on the ER-2 deployed in the same region. These\ncomparisons reveal good agreement for many species to\nwithin a few percent, and certainly within the estimated\nprecision of either data set, confirming the potential to utilize\nobservations from such disparate sources to study\natmospheric processes. However larger systematic differences\nwere evident in the measurements of CO [Chang et a[., this\nissue (a)], CC14, and HCl [Chang et a[., this issue (b)]. The\ngood agreement for measurements of NOy (in correlations\nagainst N20) corroborates the accuracy of the in situ\nmeasurements obtained with a gold catalyst total-NOy sensor.\nNewchurch et al. [this issue] describe the sensitivities and\nresults of accounting for the rapid diurnal variation of NO and\nNO2 along the line-of-sight through the terminator. The\nexcellent agreement of the diurnally corrected NO from\n\nATMOS with in situ measurements on the ER-2 provides\nevidence that these space-borne measurements can be used to\nquantify NO, in the lower stratosphere.\nCo-located measurements of water and methane by ATMOS\nhave revealed further evidence of the seasonal variation in the\nvmr of water entering the stratosphere [Abbas et al., this issue,\n(a)]. Also, the sum H 2 0 + 2xCH4 has been shown to be\nrelatively constant in the lower stratosphere but exhibits a\nmaximum between 35 and 65 km, consistent with oxidation\n\nChlorke Loading\n\n.... .........\nI\n\n1980\n\nI .........I.........\n\n2000\n\n2020\n\nI ....I.... . . . .\nI\n\n2040\n\n2060\n\nYmr\n\nFigure 3.

The Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy\n(ATMOS) instrument is a high resolution Fourier transform\nspectrometer that measures atmospheric composition from low\nEarth orbit with infrared solar occultation sounding in the limb\ngeometry. Following an initial flight in 1985, ATMOS\nparticipated in the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and\nScience (ATLAS) 1, 2, and 3 Space Shuttle missions in 1992,\n1993, and 1994 yielding a total of 440 occultation measurements\nover a nine year period. The suite of more than thirty\natmospheric trace gases profiled includes C q , O,, N20, CH,,\nH20, NO, NO,, HNO,, HC1, HF, CIONO,,, CCI,F, CC12F2,\nCHF2C1, and N,O,. The analysis method has been revised\nthroughout the mission years culminating in the \'version 2\' data\nset. The spectroscopic error analysis is described in the context\nof supporting the precision estimates reported with the profiles; in\naddition, systematic uncertainties assessed from the quality of the\nspectroscopic database are described and tabulated for\ncomparisons with other experiments.\n\nIntroduction\nRemote sensing measurements of the infrared telluric\nspectrum are a powerful means of studying chemical and\ndynamical processes in the atmosphere. The role of the ATMOS\nexperiment as part of the shuttle-borne ATLAS 1-3 missions and\nas a component of the NASA Mission to Planet Earth has been\nwidely discussed. Among the current family of space based\nremote sensing experiments ATMOS is unique in several aspects.\nThe recoverability of the instrument and the self-calibrating\nnature of solar occultation limb sounding provide confidence in\nthe reproducibility of the measurements. The instrument provides\nspectra of high photometric and spectral quality using a Fourier\ntransform spectrometer at a sufficiently rapid rate (once per 2.2\nseconds) to profile the limb of the Earth\'s atmosphere with high\n1\n\n,SAIC-NASA Langley Research Center\n3JetPropulsion Laboratory\n,NASA Marshall Space Flight Center\nSUniversityof Denver\n&alifornia Institute of Technology\n,Harvard University\n&Jniversity of Alabama at Huntsville\n,NASA Langley Research Center\nI#~rschungszentrum\nKarlsruhe\nInstitute of Astrophysics, University of Liege\n\nz\n\n2\n\n<\n\n,\nI\n\n$1\n,\n\n.!

The high spectral resolution\ncombined with broadband frequency coverage allows an\nassessment of constituent burdens from many spectral features. In\nthe present letter, the method of analysis is discussed and\nassessed from the consistency of zonal averages of observations\nat tropical latitudes (0-15 N) relative to the reported measurement\nprecisions.\nThe ATMOS level-2 data processing retrieves vertical profiles\nof atmospheric composition from portions of the infrared (6254800 cm-\', or 21-16 microns) absorption spectra. Each\noccultation uses a broad-band optical filter to improve the signal\nto noise ratio in the spectra (four of the primary filters have the\nfollowing bandpasses: f#12: 625-1450 cm-I, f#3: 1580-3450 cm\',\nf#4: 3100-4800 cm-\', f#9: 625-2450 cm-\'). Atmospheric\ntransmission spectra are \'self-calibrated\' by ratioing each\nobserved spectrum to an average of exo-atmospheric solar spectra\nobtained at tangent altitudes above 165 km. In the ATMOS\nexperiment, the high spectral resolution (0.01 cm-\' unapodized)\npermits the retrieval of atmospheric composition using narrow\nspectral windows or microwindows. For the minor gases (O,,\nC&, H 2 0 , N20, and CO) it is possible to select many\nmicrowindows (with widths between 0.2 and 0.6 cm") that\ncontain single lines with well defined continua and average the\nretrieved results; conversely, with many of the heavier gases\n(CCl,F, CC4F2, N,O,, CCl,, and SF, for example) wider windows\n(1.0 - 50 cm-I) must be used and may require the pre-retrieval of\ninterfering absorption features. The retrieval algorithm simulates\nthe transmission spectrum within a microwindow and uses a least\nsquares comparison between the observed and calculated spectra\nto adjust the assumed concentration of a gas in the model\natmosphere until the spectral residual (observed minus calculated)\nis minimized. The selection, evaluation, and combination of\nmicrowindows remains a critical task in the definition of a\nretrieval strategy; broadband high resolution spectra offer a wide\nchoice of spectral features suitable for retrievals at different\naltitude levels. However, obtaining consistent and statistically\nmeaningful results requires careful analysis. Elements of the\nretrieval process have been presented by Norton and Rinsland\n[1990], Abrams et al., [1996a], and Abrams et al., [1996b], and\nrely upon a comprehensive database of spectroscopic parameters\ndescribed by Brown et al., [1995]. A detailed recitation of the\nmethodology is beyond the scope of this presentation, instead, a\nsummary of the critical features of the processing methodology\nand a discussion .of the error budget will be presented.\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\n\nATMOS science analysis method\n\nPaper number 96GLO 1794\n0094-8534196196GL-0 1794$05.00\n\nThe ATMOS retrieval method is a three step process of\nmeasuring temperature as a function of pressure, determining the\nviewing geometry, and assessing the burden of atmospheric\n\nconstituents. Temperature is estimated from measurements of the\nslant column of CO, using many spectral features with widely\nvarying lower state energies (and hence range from temperature\ninsensitive to highly temperature sensitive transitions) with a log\nregression technique that simultaneously estimates the\ntemperature and pressure for each spectrum [Stiller et al., 19951\nThe retrieval provides profiles throughout the stratosphere and\nmesosphere with uncertainties of -3-4 K. The viewing geometry\nis determined from the measurement of the slant column C02\nwith an adjustment of the zenith angle until the calculated\ncolumn matches the observed column [Abrams et al., 1996al.\nOnce the tangent pressure is assigned, the retrieval of constituent\nconcentrations is in principle straightforward [Norton and\nRinsland, 1991; Abrams et al., 1996bl. The propagation of\ntemperature uncertainties into trace gas profiles is minimized by\nthe selection, where ever possible, of microwindows that contain\nmolecular transitions that are minimally temperature sensitive (as\ndefined by the lower state energy of the transition).\nThe retrieval of atmospheric trace gas concentrations is\nperformed with an onion-peeling algorithm that models the\natmosphere with 150 one-km thick homogeneous layers.\nSpectroscopically derived tangent pressures and a consistent\ntemperature-pressure model are assumed and used with the\nATMOS linelist compilation [Brown et al., 19951 to calculate\natmospheric transmittance T, along a slant path at the frequency\n\n4\nTc(oi,z) = exp[-ZjCkK~~~ x, vjkgkl\nn,\n(1)\nwhere z is the tangent height, qjkis the absorption coefficient for\nthe ith spectral point due to the jth gas in the kth layer, n is the\n,\nnumber density of air in the kth layer, vj, is the volume mixing\nratio of the jth gas in the kth layer, x, is a multiplicative scale\nfactor for the volume mixing ratio of the target gas (x, = 1 unless\nj = the target gas index), and & is the geometrical slant path\nthrough the kth layer. For high resolution spectra, such as those\nproduced by the ATMOS interferometer, single gas retrievals are\nsufficient and hence there is no subscript j for the scale factor x.\nFor certain gases, sequential retrievals of interfering gases are\nnecessary before the retrieval of the target gas, but this simplified\napproach allows for rapid retrievals without compromising the\nquality of the retrievals. The retrieval algorithm computes a\nresidual spectrum r(oi ) of the form\nr (oi,z) = Tm(oi,zl- T,(oi,z>\n(2)\n(where Tm(oi,z) is the measured spectrum) which is minimized,\nunder a least squares criterion when\nZi :ic(oi,z)/mtl r (oi,z) = 0\n(3)\nto scale the a priori profile, through the factor x, in a sequential\nprocess to fit each spectrum. The partial derivative of the\ntransmission with respect to scale factor x acts as a weighting\nfunction (The subscript k is dropped in Eq. 3, since in an onionpeeling algorithm, the scale factor x is adjusted for all layers\nbetween the tangent layer encompassing the current spectrum and\nthe layer encompassing the previous (higher) spectrum.). The\nassumed profiles are based on the atmosphere obtained from the\nSPACELAB-3 mission, and the retrieval process consists of three\niterations with vertical smoothing between each iteration to\nreflect the smearing of the field of view of the instrument during\nthe measurement period. The numerical behavior of this\nalgorithm has been evaluated and quantified [Abrams et al.,\n1996bl in terms of stability, convergence, independence from the\na priori profile, and validated against simultaneous multigas\nretrieval algorithms. The method, despite its simplifications\n(single gas, smoothing, etc.), has survived extensive algorithm\ncomparisons without compromising speed or accuracy and the\nvertical profiles have been widely utilized in the Upper\nAtmosphere Research Satellite validation program [Grose and\nGille, 19951.\n\nSince the final profile is reported at higher resolution than the\nmeasurements, the volume mixing ratios and uncertainties at\ndifferent altitudes are correlated, the smoothing used in the\nretrieval process removes features with vertical scales finer than\nthe 2-3 km field of view of the instrument before the retrieved\nprofile (on the 1.0 km ATMOS altitude grid) is interpolated onto\na pressure grid with 12 levels per decade of\nZonal\naverages are computed for each altitudelpressure level\nindependently.\nThe uncertainty in the gas burden is related to the\nspectroscopic residual in the following fashion\nE = v,,I [Cir2(oi,z) I I N i ~ ~ ) 2 1 1 " n \'\n(4)\nwhere v,, is the assumed volume mixing ratio profile and N is\none-half of the number of inflection points in CT& (effectively\nthe number of target gas lines within the microwindow). The\nimmediate advantage of (4) is that it readily lends itself to the\nstatistical combination of errors arising from individual\nmicrowindows and tends to be conservative rather than\noptimistic. Two additional error terms are root-sum-squared into\nthe total measurement precision, a continuum error and a\npropagation error resulting from mis-estimation of the burden in\nprevious (higher altitude) layers. These terms are usually small\ncompared to the residual error. Typically, several microwindows\nare utilized in the retrieval process, with the reported profile v\n,\nbeing the weighted average over the \'n\' microwindows\nvm, = (Z,V,,IE.Z)/(C, 1 1 ~ ~ ~ )\n(5)\nwhere v, is the vmr retrieved for the nth microwindow. An\nestimate of the precision of the measurement is determined two\nways. The first is simply the standard error of the mean (lo)\nE 2 = I/[& 11E.Z ]\n(6)\nas a measure of the precision of the results. The second is the\nerror on the estimation of the mean E,,, obtained from the\nstandard deviation\ne = *Xn\n:\n,\n[vn2/q,\' - ~ , ~ ~ / q (M-1).\n,~]l\n(7)\nNormally M-1 is the number of degrees of freedom, but in cases\nwhere the individual error estimates E, can be significantly\ndifferent (as will occur when results from wide and narrow\nspectral windows are combined together) an alternate definition\nof M:\nM = L ,(~~E,,)I~I[Z,\nC\nl/q,Zl.\n(8)\nyields a more conservative (larger) error estimate. This effective\nM is smaller than the actual number of microwindows except in\nthe case where the weights are the same. The reported precision\nis taken as the larger of the two estimates. In many cases Eqs. 6\nand 7 give quite similar results, which suggests that the line\nparameters used for each microwindow are not significantly\nbiased relative to the spectroscopic precision (since\ninconsistencies in spectroscopic parameters would cause the\nstandard deviation and the standard error to differ). The similarity\nof the standard error (based only on residuals) and the standard\ndeviation (which assesses the weighted variance about the mean)\nshould convey a degree of confidence that the reported\nuncertainties are reasonably conservative and plausibly reflect the\nquality of the measurements.\n\n\xe2\x82\xac2\n\nProcessing Methodology\nThere have been three major versions of the ATMOS data,\nreflecting the increasing sophistication of the retrieval\nmethodology. The three versions are distinguishable by the final\nprocessing date: preliminary results (version 0) were processed\nprior to 1 October 1994, version 1 data was processed between 1\nOctober 1994 and 14 December 1994 and was widely used in\nevaluations of measurements made from the Upper Atmosphere\nResearch Satellite WARS), and version 2 data was processed\nbetween 15 December 1994 and 15 April 1995 and is presented in\n\nTangent Pressure Precision (%)\n\nPrecision (%)\n\nFigure 1. Tangent pressure precisions (viewing geometry).\n\nFigure 2. Precisions (root sum square of retrieval precision and\ntangent pressure precision) for the minor gases.\n\nthe accompanying letters in this issue. All current ATMOS data\nhas been processed with the version 2 methodology.\nIn early 1995, the ATMOS data set was revised to address\ncertain limitation of the version 1 data set; specifically,\ninconsistencies in the derivation of pressures with the\nsimultaneous pressure-temperature algorithm led to the\nconclusion that the version 1 constituent profiles could be locally\nbiased by as much as 8-15%. Three new elements were added to\nthe process: (a) a final pressure sounding was performed using the\nversion 1 temperature profile and the assumed mean stratospheric\nC02 volume mixing ratio profile of 350 parts per million by\n\nvolume (ppmv) in 1994 to minimize the uncertainties in the\nviewing geometry determination, (b) improved low altitude\ntangent pressure determination (through the definition of new\nrnicrowindows), and (c) the spectroscopic precision was redefined to be more consistent with the random errors in the\nretrieval process (Eq. 4). The precision of the tangent pressure\nsoundings as functions of pressure are illustrated in Figure 1; the\nvariation between the optical filters reflects differences in the\nspectroscopy and number of microwindows at each pressure level\navailable for each of the optical filters. The fractional error for the\npressure sounding ranges between 0.5% and 9%, with the best\nresults typically in the pressure range between 100 and 1 mbars\n(approximately 18 to 48 km altitude). Given a 7 km scale height,\nsuch an uncertainty corresponds to a relative pointing uncertainty\nof 35-630 meters (70 meterslpercent uncertainty) which is modest\nwith respect to the absolute pointing knowledge which is\ntypically not better than 1 km (14% in pressure). Below 100\nmbars the uncertainty increases, but is still quite acceptable at 300\nmbars (approximately 8 km); similarly, in several filters there is a\nregion around 50 km where the number of usable features is\ninsufficient to maintain consistent precision\n\nTable 1.

For the\nminor and trace gases with well isolated spectral features (C02,\n0,, N,O, CH,, &O, HCl, and HF) where many microwindows\nmay be combined the precision is typically less than 10%.\nRetrievals of profiles of the chlorofluorocarbons (CC1,F and\nCCl,F,) with broadband spectral features that are minimally\noverlapped by features of other gases yield small precision\nestimates due to the large amount of spectral information. At the\nother extreme are species such as HNO,, N,O,, CHCIF,, and\nClONO, which require pre-retrieval of 1-6 interfering species. In\nsuch cases, the residuals are dominated by interferences and lead\nto large precision estimates. As illustrated in Figs. 2-4, if the\nprofiles are sharply peaked then the error estimates will tend to\n100% at the top and bottom of the profiles, indicating the full\nrange of measurable signal. N,O, is a special case, since the\ndiurnal variation is sufficiently large that sunset retrievals\ntypically have an uncertainty of 16-25%, while the sunrise\nmeasurements, sampling a much larger amount of gas along the\nline of sight, have smaller uncertainties (note that, the only\ntropical sunrise data obtained by ATMOS was during the 1992\nATLAS-1 mission).\nThe tangent pressure precision is included in quadrature with\nthe retrieval precision (Eq. 4) in the precision estimates for each\nconstituent (temperature errors are sufficiently small and may be\nneglected).

For the trace gases,\nthe standard deviation is typically comparable to the precision,\nindicating that the precision estimate and the measurement\nvariance are in reasonable agreement.

Measurements of the long-lived tracers CH4, N20, and\nHF from the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy\n(ATMOS) instrument during the Atmospheric Laboratory for\nScience and Applications-2 (ATLAS-2) Space Shuttle mission in\nApril 1993 are used to infer average winter descent rates ranging\nfrom 0.8 krdmonth at 20 km to 3.2 krdmonth at 40 km in the\nArctic polar vortex during the 1992-93 winter. Descent rates in\nthe mid-stratosphere are similar to those deduced for the Antarctic\nvortex using ATMOSIATLAS-3 measurements in November\n1994, but the shorter time period of descent in the Arctic leads to\nsmaller total distances of descent. Strong horizontal gradients\nobserved along the vortex edge indicate that the Arctic vortex\nremains a significant barrier to transport at least until mid-April in\nthe lower to middle stratosphere.\n\nIntroduction\nRecent theoretical studies have addressed the transport of air\nthrough the polar vortices and the evidence for and against the\nmixing of air confined within the vortex with extra-vortex air.\nManney et al.

The observed distributions of the long-lived tracers N20,\nC% and HF give information on transport effects that have\noccurred during the winter, and provide a dynamical context for\nanalyses of the chemistry of reactive nitrogen and chlorine\nspecies as the polar vortex erodes in spring. Approximately 50\nsunrise observations were concentrated in a narrow band of\nlatitudes from 60-65"N, with the remaining sunset observations\nlatitudes between the Equator and 50"s. The ATLAS-3 mission,\nflown eighteen months later in November 1994, provided\nmeasurements at high Northern midlatitudes, from which the\nseasonal variation in the upper stratospheric trace gases can be\naddressed. The results presented in this Letter focus on\nestimation of descent rates from profiles of N20, CH4, and\nHF measured inside and outside the Arctic polar vortex during\nlate winter and complement an analysis of similar measurements\npresented in an accompanying Letter [Abrams et al., 19961 of\ndescent within the htarctic polar vortex.\n\nMean tracer profiles and descent rates\nFigure shows a cross-section of N20 as a function of longitude and potential temperature (0), constructed from data taken\nthroughout the nine day ATLAS-2 mission. Two regions ofvery\nstrong gradients in N20 are seen between 500 and 150"E longitude, at levels up to about 900 (approx. 30 km), indicating that\nvortex and extra-vortex air remain largely unmixed in the lower\nand middle stratosphere as late as mid-April 1993.

[1996], we construct average vortex and\nextra-vortex profiles of N20, CH4, and HF on the basis of both\ntracer mixing ratios and sPV values on the 655 K isentropic surface. Profiles with N20 and CHq less (greater) than 30 ppbv and\n0.6 ppmV, respectively, and sPV greater (less) than 1.6 (1.2) are\nconsidered to be inside (outside) the vortex. Figures 2-4 show the\nmean vortex and extra-vortex profiles of N20, CHq, and HF\ndetermined in this manner. As was apparent in Figure 1, there is\na strong distinction between vortex (low N20, low CH4, high HF)\nand extra-vortex (high N20, high CH4, low HF) profiles at levels\nbelow about 35-40 km. Below 20 km,vortex and extra-vortex\nprofiles begin to converge, suggesting that there may be a larger\ndegree of horizontal mixing below this level.\n\n\\,\n\nABRAMS ET AL.: TRACE GAS TRANSPORT IN THE ARCTIC VORTEX\n60\n\n+Ntside vortex\n\n50\n40\n\n9\n30\n20\n10\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n(3-4W R ( P P ~ V )\nFigure 3.

This is evidence that there is\nno longer any significant: barrier : horizontal transpora in the\nr\nupper stratosphere, ssJaoe vortex and extra-vortex air are no longer\ndistinguishable. However, despite the large amount of dynarnicd\nactivity that has occun\'ed throughout the winter [e.g., Mmney\n\net ah, 19941, at levels below about 30 km there is a distinct\nseparation between the spring vortex and extra-vortex tracer\nmixing ratios, At these levels, a signature of relatively unmixed\ndescent in the vortex is appwent. Mixing ratios in the lower\nstratospheric vortex (e.g., 20 km) are typical of middle to upper\nstratatiphere extra-vortex values (e.g, 35-40 k ) The lack bf\nm.\nevidence of mesospheric air in the Arctic vortex, as was seen in\nthe Antarctic during November 1494 [Abrams et aL, 19961, is\nprobably due primarily to the shorter period of iddescent and the\ngreater degree of horizontal mixing in the Arctic.\nDescent rates are inferred from the tracer measurements by\nestimating the vertical separation between the late wider vortex\nand extra-vortex tracer profiles for similar tracer mixing ratios, ss\ndiscussed in greater detail by Abrams et al. [1996]. The estimates\nf\nof descent rates depend upon an assumption o unmixed descent\n(that is, the only thing that alters the profides is v d p d motion);\nwhile this assumption hsls been shown to be less appropriate in\nthe NJI than in the SH, the strong tracer gradients along the\nvvrtex edge below ,about 30 lui~\nsuggest that it is a valid\nassumption at these levels. Differences between the extra-vortex\nspring profile and the winter midlatitude profile suggest some\nseasonal differences in the midlatitude upper stratosphere. In\nadhition, the "vortex" profile is similar to the "extra-vortex\'?\nprofiIe at these levels, since the vortex has broken down, and\nmixing occqrred, as discussed above, Thus, any signature of\nunmixed descent at levels above about 35 km has been obscured\nby mixing.\n\nNO VMR (ppb")\n,\nFigure 2.

[I9941 assumed a starting date of 1 November\nfor NH descent rate calculations, and a 4.6 month period of\ndescent ending on 21 March. As discussed by Abrams et al.\n[1996], the most appropriate starting date for calculations of\nunmixed descent is a function of altitude, and depends on when a\nbarrier to transport has formed at the appropriate level. Table 1\nshows two descent rates: the first calculated assuming a\n1 November starting date (Rate), and the second assuming an\nadjusted starting date based on examination of sPV gradients\n(Adj. Rate, assuming the starting date (St. Date) given in the\ntable), as described by Abrams et al. [1996]. Figure 5 shows\ndescent rates calculated using the adjusted starting dates and\nobservations of N20, CH4, and HF. These are compared with\nseveral previous theoretical results. The results for each of the\nthree tracers measured by ATMOS are consistent within the\nmeasurement precision. The results agree favorably with\ntheoretical descent rates for the NH obtained by Manney et al.\n[I9941 and Rosenjield et al. [I9941 in the middle stratosphere\nbetween 30 and 35 km, but below 30 km the theoretical results\nare 60% larger than the measurements at 25 km and 100% larger\nthan the measurements at 20 km. Recalling that the tracer profiles\nsuggested more mixing near 20 km, the calculations from\nATMOS measurements may underestimate descent at low\naltitudes because the profiles are significantly affected by\nhorizontal transport. In the upper stratosphere, there is no\nevidence of large scale descent of air, as suggested by the\ntheoretical calculations [Rosenfield et al., 1994; Manney et al.,\n19941, or of air originating above the stratopause, as was apparent\nin the Antarctic [Abrams et al., 19961. However, during the\nATLAS-2 mission, horizontal mixing is expected to dilute the\nvortex air sufficiently at these altitudes so as to obscure any\nevidence of vertical motion. The absence of extremely low N20\nand CH4 mixing ratios such as those observed in the Antarctic\nlower stratosphere may be explained by the shorter duration of the\nperiod of descent, and the mixing that has already occurred in the\nArctic upper stratosphere.\nPrevious analyses of descent in the Arctic used one of three\nclasses of long-lived tracer measurements: airborne column or in\nsitu measurement which provide spatially distributed results\nwithout vertical information, or balloon-borne measurements\nwhich yield information about the vertical distribution of tracers,\nbut only at a specific location. Mankin et al. [1990], Toon et al.\n[1992], and Traub et al. [I9941 inferred 5-6 km of subsidence\nwithin the polar vortex from total column measurements obtained\nonboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft. Similarly, Lowenstein et al.\n[I9901 inferred a subsidence of 4-6 km above 17 km based on\n\n2343\n\nmeasurements from the NASA ER-2 aircraft. Balloon\nmeasurements between 1987 and 1990 at 68"N suggested a\nvertical subsidence of about 7 km over the period between\nNovember and February [Schmidt et al., 19911. To the degree\npossible without detailed vertical information inside and outside\nthe polar vortex, these measurements are consistent with the\nmeasurements from the ATLAS-2 mission as well as model\ncalculations. Descent rates have been inferred in several more\nrecent experiments; Bauer et al. [I9941 obtained vertical descent\nrates of 2.0 kdmonth at 29.8 km, which agrees adequately with\nthe present measurements but also found rates of 3.1 kdmonth\naround 26 km, which is nearly a factor of two larger than\nATMOS measurements and theoretical estimates. Schoeberl\net al. [I9921 and Traub et al. [I9951 obtained descent rates\nof 1.29 and 1.30 kmlmonth in the lower stratosphere at\n15.5 and 18 km, respectively.

[1992]) may result from differences between the\nyears of the observations (1992 and 1990, respectively), the lack\nof vertical resolution, different assumptions about the descent\nperiod, or from the ATMOS observations underestimating descent\nonce horizontal mixing becomes significant. The inclusion of\nmeasurements at the "edge" of the polar vortex which are likely\nto be most affected by mixing would lead to an underestimation\nof the descent rates, however, the statistical weight of such\nmeasurements was assessed and determined to be small relative to\nthe measurement variance. The extra-vortex seasonal variation,\nillustrated in Figures 2-4 is no more that 2 km at most altitudes\nand would results in a modest increase in the descent rates.\nSimilarly, the estimation of "net" descent rates neglects the\ndetailed motion of the air during the winter and consequently may\noverestimate the descent period. Manney et al. [I9951 use results\nfrom CLAES to deduce descents rates of 1.4 and 1.6 kdmonth\nduring the 1992-93 early and late winter, respectively, at about\n21 km, falling near the theoretical values, but between those and\nthe estimates from ATMOS observations. In comparison with the\nanalysis of descent from ATMOS observations within the\nAntarctic polar vortex [Abrams et al., 19961, the average descent\nrates in the Arctic are similar to those calculated for the Antarctic.\nHowever, because of the shorter period of descent in the Arctic,\nthe magnitude of the total descent in the Arctic is much less.\n\n-\n\n4 5 ~ T M O Observations\nS\n\n,.+*-\n\n4\n\n-.-.Rosenfield\nI\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nl l l l\n\nl l\n\n3\n\nl l l\n\nl l\n\n4\n\nl I\n\n1\n\n5\n\nDescent Rate (kdmonth)\nFigure 5.

Observations of the long-lived tracers N20, CH4 and\nHF obtained by the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy\n(ATMOS) instrument in early November 1994 are used to\nestimate average descent rates during winter in the Antarctic\npolar vortex of 0.5 to 1.5 kdmonth in the lower stratosphere, and\n2.5 to 3.5 k d m o n t h in the middle and upper stratosphere.\nDescent rates inferred from ATMOS tracer observations agree\nwell with theoretical estimates obtained using radiative heating\ncalculations. Air of mesospheric origin (N20 < 5 ppbV) was\nobserved at altitudes above about 25 km within the vortex.\nStrong horizontal gradients of tracer mixing ratios, the presence\nof mesospheric air in the vortex in early spring, and the variation\nwith altitude of inferred descent rates indicate that the Antarctic\nvortex is highly isolated from midlatitudes throughout the winter\nfrom approximately 20 km to the stratopause. The 1994\nAntarctic vortex remained well isolated between 20 and 30 km\nthrough at least mid-November.\n\n2\n\n\'\n,\n\n,\n\n\'\n\n.;/\'\n\n3\n\n\'\n\n., -- ,\n\'\n\nI\n\n.\n\nATLAS3 mission (3 to 12 November, 1994).

Thus, there is not expected to be as strong\na barrier to transport at levels below 400 K. These strong N20\nand CH4 gradients clearly demonstrate the extremely strong barrier to horizontal transport at the edge of the Antarctic polar vortex between 400 and 1100 K, and that this barrier remained intact\nin the lower stratosphere until at least mid-November 1994.\nA vortextextra-vortex classification scheme was developed\nwhich requires N20, CI&, and sPV values on the 655 K\nisentropic surface all to be characteristic of the vortex (mixing\n\n100\n\n200\n\nMean vortex and extra-vortex volume mixing ratio profiles of\nlong-lived tracers measured in November 1994 (early spring) are\ncompared with early winter profiles from the ATLAS-:! mission\n(April 1993) in Figures 3-5. The ATMOS measurements suggest\nminimal seasonal variation in the upper stratospheric profiles of\nlong-lived tracers at midlatitudes (45-60"s) and that descent rates\nwithin the polar vortex can be assessed relative to either extravortex air that has not been within the polar vortex or to spring air\nprior to the onset of winter-time descent. In the subsequent analysis, the former approach is used: comparison of vortex and\nextra-vortex profiles obtained during the same season (spring)\nand latitude, with corroboration from the opposite season extravortex profiles. An eight month period of descent (starting March\n1) has been assumed in theoretical studies [Fisheret al., 1993 and\nRosenfield et al., 19941. However, the ATMOS measurements\nfrom the ATLAS-2 mission indicate that modest descent has\noccurred at altitudes above 35 km in early April, but not for lower\n\n300\n\nLongitude\n\nO.Oe+@o\n\n5.06-07\n1 .Oe-06\nMethane Volume M i n g Ratid (ppV)\n\nWgure 2.

Since descent in much of the high-latitude stratosphere\nbegins shortly after the summer solstice [Kiehl and Solomon,\n19861, well before the vortex fonns, the relevant starting time for\nexamination of unmixed descent is the date after which the polar\nvortex has developed to the extent of providing a significant barrier to transport. Before this time, any signature of descent would\nbe lost due to unrestrained horizontal mixing. To estimate this\ndate, we examined the time evolution of sPV gradients as a function of sPV, during the SH fall of 1994, at levels throughout the\nstratosphere and located the first date on which sPV gradients\nassociated with the polar vortex were significantly stronger than\nin surrounding regions. This leads to starting dates, given in\nTable 1, ranging from 25 March 1994 in the upper stratosphere\nto 12 May 1994 in the lower stratosphere.\nMean descent rates are determined from spring vortex and\nextra-vortex profiles of tracers assuming unmixed vertical descent\nwithin the vortex (i.e., vertical motion is the only factor that alters\nthe profiles of long-lived tracers.), and that extra-vortex profiles\nare representative of fall conditions. For each of the three longlived tracers, the descent rate (Adj. Rate, in the table) has been\ninferred by dividing the vertical distance between the inside and\noutside profiles at similar gas amounts ( A z in Table 1) by the time\nperiod of descent, based on starting dates derived from the evolution of sPV (St. Date in Table 1). Descent rates assuming an\neight month period of descent are also given in Table 1 (Rate).\nDescent rates for each of the tracers, given in Figure 6, are in\ngood agreement given the precisions of the measurements.

Adjusted descent rates obtained from ATMOS trace\ngas measurements compared with previous observations and\ntheoretical calculations. Table 1 enumerates the starting dates\nused to adjust the descent rates. For comparison the rate of 1 kml\nmonth at 24 km corresponds to 32.9 d d a y , or 0.039 d s e c ,\nassuming 365.25112 = 30.44 dayslmonth.\n\nunweighted standard deviations are between 10 and 25%, and the\nprecision of the vertical registration ranges between 0.05 km (at\n20 km) and 0.4 km (at 50 km) are in relatively good agreement\nwith the scatter between the rates inferred from each of the three\ngases. Air initially at 20 km descended 0.6 kdmonth, while air\ninitially at 30 km descended 1.5 kdmonth. Air in the lower\nmesosphere at initial heights above 50 km descended 3.3-3.5 k d\nmonth to levels around 600 K (approximately 20-25 hPa) The\ncurvature of the descent rate profiles inferred from ATMOS measurements of N 2 0 , CH4, and HF provides additional\ncorroborative evidence for a highly isolated vortex throughout the\nwinter, during periods of rapid loss of Q, H20, and nitrogen\noxides within the vortex. In 1994, the vortex remained strong and\nisolated between about 20 and 30 km until at least mid\nNovember. Therefore, at these levels, polar processes are not\nexpected to have any strong direct impact on mid-latitude\ndistributions of 03,\n&O, and nitrogen oxides until later in the\nspring.\nRosenfield et al. [I9941 calculated diabatic descent rates using\nNMC temperatures during the 1992 SH winter, and found average\nwinter (March-October) descent rates of 0.4-0.9 kdmonth for &r\nstarting in the lower stratosphere, and 3.3-3.6 kndmonth for air\nstarted at 52 km. This profile is shown in Figure 6. Rosenfield\nnoted the paucity of information on descent rates inferred from\ntracer profiles in comparison with column measurements indicating 6-8 km of subsidence above 12 km [Toonet al., 19891.\nGround-based measurements of N20 [Crewell et al., 19951 at the\nSouth pole were used to derive early winter, late winter, and net\nwinter descent rates. The net winter descent rates of Crewell\net al. [I9951 compare favorably with the present results. Analysis\nof UARSMALOE satellite measurements [Schoeberl eta!., 19951\nyielded descent rates of 1.5-1.8 kdmonth for the lower stratosphere (altitude below 25 km), during September and October and\na net winter descent rate of 1.5 kdmonth. These descent rates\nagree closely with the present measurements and the theoretical\ncalculations of Rosenfield et al. [1994].\nThe estimates from ATMOS presented here constitute minimum estimate of descent rates, since horizontal mixing will dilute\nthe signature of unmixed descent in the vortex. This is expected\n\n2348\n\nABRAMS ET AL.: LONG-LIVED TRACERS AND DESCENT IN THE ANTARCTIC VORTEX\n\nto influence our results most at the highest and lowest levels,\nwhere there is evidence of significant horizontal mixing.\nSimilarly, seasonal variation in the extra-vortex tracer levels, or\nmixing gradients at the vortex edge, and averaging over the entire\nseason prior to the measurement period would compound the\nunder-estimation of the descent rates. The descent rates for late\nwinter [Schoeberl e t al., 1995 and Crewell et al., 19951 are 2-3\ntimes larger than the net rates. Given the differences between the\nmeasurement years (Toon-1987; Crewell-1993; Schoeberl-1992,\nand 1994 in the present work), periods, and durations, the results\nare remarkably consistent. The ATMOS measurements extend\nthe altitude range of descent measurements up to the lower mesosphere and provide definitive evidence of transport of mesospheric air to levels near 25 km.\n\nReferences\nAbrams, M.

Volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles of OCS, HCN,\nSF6, and CHClF2 (HCFC-22) have been measured near 30"N\nlatitude by the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy\nFourier transform spectrometer during shuttle flights on 29 April6 May 1985 and 3-2 November 1994. The change in the\nconcentration of each molecule in the lower stratosphere has been\nderived for this 9 112-year period by comparing measurements\nbetween potential temperatures of 395 to 800 K (-17 to 30 km\naltitude) relative to simultaneously measured values of the longlived tracer N20. Exponential rates of increase inferred for\n1985-to-1994 from these comparisons are (0.1 f 0.4)% yr-l for\nOCS, (1.0 f 1.0)% yr-l for HCN, (8.0 f 0.7)% yr-l for SF6, and\n(8.0 1.0)% yr-l for CHCIFz (HCFC-22), 1 sigma. The lack of\nan appreciable trend for OCS suggests the background (i.e.,\nnonvolcanic) source of stratospheric aerosol was the same during\nthe two periods. These results are compared with trends reported\nin the literature.\n\n+\n\nIntroduction\nThe Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS)\ninstrument is a 0.01-cm-\' resolution Fourier transform\nspectrometer (FTS) designed to record broadband, infrared solar\noccultation spectra of the middle atmosphere from low Earth orbit\n[Farmer, 19871. To date, the ATMOS FTS has flown 4 times on\nboard the shuttle as part of the Spacelab 3 (29 April-6 May\n1985), ATLAS (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and\nScience) 1 (24 March-2 April 1992), ATLAS 2 (8-17 April\n1993), and ATLAS 3 (3-12 November 1994) missions.\nAn important geographic measurement overlap occurred at\n28"N-33"N latitude where occultations were recorded at sunset\nduring the Spacelab 3 and ATLAS 3 flights, respectively. The\nmiddle atmosphere profiles of more than 2 dozen molecules\nved from these measurements provide a unique record of\nnges in stratospheric composition at northern lower midla~~tudes the 9 112 years separating these 2 ATMOS missions\nover\n[i.e., Zander et al., 1996a,b].\n\'NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA.\n\'~nstitute of Astrophysics, University of LiBge, 4000 LiBge-Cointe,\nBe1 ium\n\'Jet bropulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology,\nPasadena.\n4~niversity Denver, Denver, CO.\nof\n\'Science Applications International Corporation, Hampton, VA.\n6~~~~ Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL.\n7~niversity Alabama, Huntsville.\nof\n8~alifomia\nInstitute of Technology, Pasadena.\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GL0 1234\n0094-8534196196GL-01234$05.00\n\nThe present Letter uses the Spacelab 3 and ATLAS 3 measurements in this common latitudinal band to assess changes in\nthe volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of 4 important trace molecules:\nOCS, HCN, SF6, and CHClF2 (HCFC-22). For each molecule,\nthe measured VMRs in the lower stratosphere are referenced to\nsimultaneous values for the conserved, long-lived tracer N20 to\nremove the contribution of atmospheric dynamics to the measured\nvariations of the target molecules. The 1985-1994 trends inferred\nfrom the VMR differences have been compared with values\nreported in the literature for the same time period.\n\nSpectroscopic Analysis\nPressure-temperature and constituent profiles were derived\nfrom the ATMOS spectra with the Occultation Display Spectra\n(ODs) onion-peeling retrieval algorithm [Norton and Rinsland,\n19911 and the 1995 ATMOS line parameters compilation [Brown\net al., 19961. Except for HCN, the spectroscopic parameters for\nthe target molecules are significantly different than those used for\nthe previous version of the ATMOS database [Brown et al.,\n19871. The C02 profile is a fundamental assumption in both\nthe pressure-temperature and subsequent VMR retrievals. The\nC02 VMRs assumed for the Spacelab 3 mission decrease from\n3.40 x\nat the surface to 3.33 x\nin the middle and upper\nstratosphere. Corresponding values for the ATLAS 3 mission are\n3.64 x 1 w 4 and 3.51 x 1w4, respectively. A synopsis of the\nprocedure used to produce the version 2 V M R profiles reported in\nthis paper and estimates of their precisions and accuracies have\nbeen provided by Abrams et al. [1996]. Data from all ATMOS\nmissions, including Spacelab 3, were reprocessed.\nFor OCS and HCN, narrow intervals ("microwindows")\ncontaining isolated, unblended target spectral features were fitted\nby line-by-line methods over prespecified ranges in tangent\naltitude. A weighted mean and weighted standard deviation of\nthe individual profiles were then calculated for each occultation\nand interpolated to a potential temperature (0) grid. Six OCS\nmicrowindows in the v3 band provided coverage between\naltitudes of 5 and 25 km. Ten microwindows in the v3 band were\nused to measure HCN between altitudes of 6 and 30 km. The\nprofiles for SF6 and CHClF2 were derived from unresolved Q\nbranches on the basis of temperature- and pressure-dependent\nabsorption coefficients from laboratory spectra. A single\nmicrowindow was fitted for each molecule. For SF6, the\nmicrowindow spanned 945.0 to 952.0 cm-l, covering the intense\nv3 band Q branch between altitudes of 13 to 28 km. For CHCF2,\na 0.5-cm-\' wide microwindow centered at 829.05 cm-l was used\nto measure the 2v6 Q branch between 13 and 33 km. Examples\nof the target features in lower stratospheric ATMOS solar\noccultation spectra have been presented previously [Zunderet al.,\n1987; 1988; Rinsland et al., 19931.\nProfiles of [N20] (where the brackets are used to denote the\nspecies VMR) were obtained by combining measurements from\n\nRINSLAND ET AL.: TRENDS OF OCS, HCN, SF6, AND CHCLFz (HCFC-22) IN THE LOWER\n\n2350\n\nmicrowindows in several bands, depending on the filter selected\nfor the occultation. Ground-based spectroscopic measurements\nindicate a N 2 0 total column exponential growth rate of (0.36 f\n0.06)% yr-l between 1984 and 1992 [Zander et al., 1994al.\nAssuming this rate, we detrend the N20 measurements by defining [N20*] =1.035*[%0] for Spacelab 3 and [N20*] =[NzO] for\nATLAS 3 data. [HCN] and [OCS] with relative uncertainties\ngreater than 20% and [SF6] and [CHC1F2] with relative uncertainties above 35% have been excluded from our analysis along with\n[N20*] above 330 ppbv.\n\nResults\nCarbonyl Sulfide (OCS)\nFigure 1 presents a plot of simultaneous OCS and N20*\nVMRs from 4 Spacelab 3 and 6 ATLAS 3 occultations. Solid\nand dashed lines show the corresponding OCS VMRs derived by\naveraging the measurements in intervals of 0.05 in log10(N20*).\nThe 1994-to-1985 OCS VMR ratio was calculated for each\nbin. The average and standard deviation of these ratios are 1.01 f\n0.04, 1 sigma. Assuming an exponential model for the\nOCS VMR increase with time, the corresponding trend is (0.1\n0.4)% y i l . Hence, the measurements indicate no significant\nchange in the OCS lower stratospheric VMR over this time\nperiod.\nThe inference of a negligible long-term OCS trend is\nconsistent with the results obtained from high resolution groundbased IR measurements [Rinsland et al., 19921. Total columns\nretrieved from spectra recorded at the National Solar Observatory\n(NSO, 31.9"N latitude, 111.6" longitude) between May 1977\nand March 1991 showed a trend of (0.1 f 0.2)% yr-l, 2 sigma,\nwhile similar measurements at the International Station of the\nJungfraujoch (ISSJ, 46.5"N latitude, 8.O0E longitude) between\nOctober 1984 and April 1991 yielded a trend of (-0.1 f\n0.5)% yr-l, 2 sigma.\n\n0.0\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n200\nN20*.

An increase in OCS concentrations could cause\nimportant climate changes [Turco et al., 19801 and increase\nstratospheric sulfate aerosol mass, altering O3 concentrations\nthrough heterogeneous chemical reactions [Hofmann, 19901. Our\nmeasurements suggest little change in the background stratospheric aerosol mass between the two periods of observation.\n\nHydrogen Cyanide (HCN)\n\n0.0\n100\n\n150\n\n200\nN20*, (ppbv)\n\n300\n\n400\n\nFigure 1.

Solid and dashed lines show [OCS] averages as a\nfunction of [NzO*] derived from the 1985 and 1994\nmeasurements, respectively. See text for details.\n\n\'\n\nFigure 2 presents measurements of lower stratospheric [HCN]\nversus [NzO*] from 6 Spacelab 3 and 4 ATLAS 3 occultations.\nThe format is the same as in Figure 1. Based on the mean and\nstandard deviation calculated from the averages shown by the\nsolid and dashed lines, the average 1994-to-1985 HCN VMR\nratio is 1.10 f 0.10, 1 sigma. This value corresponds to an\nexponential increase rate of (1.0 If: 1.0)% yr-l. Hence, there is\nmarginal evidence for an increase in HCN VMRs in the lower\nstratosphere over the 9 112 year-period separating the Spacelab 3\nand ATLAS 3 missions.\nTo our knowledge, the only previous investigation of the HCN\nlong-term trend was reported by Mahieu et al. [1995]. In that\nstudy, high resolution ground-based IR measurements obtained at\nNSO between June 1984 and June 1993 and at ISSJ between May\n1978 and July 1992 were analyzed to derive total vertical column\nabundances that indicated HCN long-term column trends\nof (-0.30 f 0.50)% yr-l above NSO and (0.99 0.51)% yr-l\nabove ISSJ. Hence, the present results are in better agreement\nwith the ISSJ measurements [Mahieu et al., 19951, which suggest\na small, long-term increase in HCN abundance.\n\n+\n\nRINSLAND ET AL.: TRENDS OF OCS, HCN, SF,, AND CHCLF, (HCFC-22) IN THE LOWER\nSulfur hexafluoride (SF6)\nThe lower stratospheric measurements of [SF6] versus [I\\ILO*]\nnear 30"N latitude from 1 Spacelab 3 and 6 ATLAS 3 occultations are presented in Figure 3. A substantial VMR increase over\nthe 9 112 years separating the 2 missions is readily apparent.\nBased on the measurements, the average 1994-to-1985 SF6\nVMR ratio in the lower stratosphere is 2.14 f 0.14, 1 sigma,\nwhich corresponds to an exponential growth rate of (8.0\n0.7)% yr-l.\nThe present result is in agreement with 4 recent determinations\nof the SF6 long-term trend, all based on high resolution infrared\nsolar absorption spectra. Rinsland et al. [I9901 deduced an\nexponential growth rate of (7.4 1.9)% yr-l from comparison of\nsolar occultation measurements recorded near 30"N latitude\nbetween March 1981 and June 1988 in the 12-18 km altitude\nregion. Zander et al. [I9911 reported SF6 total column\nexponential increase rates of (6.6 7.2)% yr-l, 2 sigma, above\nNSO between March 1981 and June 1990 and (6.9 f 2.8)% yr-l,\n2 sigma, above ISSJ between June 1986 and June 1990. The\nlarger uncertainty in the NSO measurement was the result of\nstronger H0 and C02 interferences overlapping the target SF6v3\nz\nband Q branch (the NSO FTS is at an altitude of 2095m as\ncompared to 3580m for the ISSJ FTS). An exponential growth\nrate of (8.7 k 2.2)% yr-l, 2 sigma, was inferred by comparing\nUniversity of Denver (32"N), ATMOS Spacelab 3 (3loN), and\nATMOSIATLAS 1 (283, 54"s) measurements in the 12-18 km\naltitude region after applying a small correction for the SF6\ninterhemispheric gradient based on model calculations [Rimland\net al., 19931.\nRecently, SF, measurements with a gas chromatograph have\nbeen obtained from a monitoring site in rural eastern North\nCarolina [Hurst et al., 19951. Preliminary results suggest an\nincrease of (0.151 f 0.021) x 10-l2 in baseline SF6 mixing ratios\nduring 1995, corresponding to a rate of (4.9 f 0.7)% yr-\', 1 sigma\n(D. F. Hurst, unpublished data, 1996). This growth rate is lower\nthan indicated by the published IR measurements.\nAlthough the atmospheric concentration of SF6 is increasing\nrapidly and the gas is likely to have a very long lifetime [KO\net al., 1993; Ravishankara et a l , 19931, its abundance is very\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nFigure 4. Same as Figure 1 except for C H C T (HCFC-22).\n\nlow. The projected greenhouse warming potential of SF6 on a per\nmolecule basis is high, but the net warming due to SF, will\nremain negligible with respect to that of C02, at least th;ough\n2010 [KOet al., 19931.\n\nThe comparison in Figure 4, derived from 3 Spacelab 3 and 4\nATLAS 3 occultations, shows the substantial growth of\nhydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)-22 that has occurred in the\nlower stratosphere in response to the increasing use of this\nmolecule as a substitute for the CFCs, particularly CClzF2\n(CFC-12) and CCIJF (CFC-11) [AFEAS, 19951. The average\n1994-to-1985 HCFC-22 lower stratospheric VMR ratio derived\nfrom the ATMOS measurements is 2.14 f 0.21, 1 sigma, which\ncorresponds to an exponential HCFC-22 growth rate of (8.0 f\n1.O)% yr-l.\nThe present result is consistent with recent IR and in situ\nHCFC-22 trend determinations. Zander et al. [I9941 reported\ntotal column exponential increase rates of (7.0 0.23)% yr-l\nabove NSO from December 1980 to April 1992 and (7.0\n0.35)% yr-l above ISSJ from June 1986 to November 1992.\nIrion et al. [I9941 inferred an exponential total column growth\nrate of (6.7 f 0.5)% yr-\' on the basis of IR solar spectra recorded\nfrom the Table Mountain Facility, Wrightwood, California\n(34.4"N), between October 1985 and July 1990. A slightly higher\ngrowth rate of (7.3 0.3)% yr-\' was deduced by Montzka et d.\n[I9931 from surface ambient air sampling measurements from\nmid-1987 through 1992. Solar occultation IR measurements near\n30"N latitude between March 1981 and June 1988 also yielded a\nhigher exponential growth rate, (9.4 f 1.3)% yr-l in the\n12-18 km altitude region [Rinsland et al., 19901.\nEmpirically-based determinations of global ozone depletion\npotentials for HCFC-22 are up to a factor of 2 larger than values\nfrom some gas phase models [Solomon et al., 19921. The\nsimilarity of the observed growth rates of HCFC-22 and SF6 and\nthe similarity of the slopes of these gases relative to N 2 0 suggest\nthat the stratospheric lifetime of HCFC-22 is much longer than\nthe published estimate of 210 years [NASA, 19941.

Among the most significant results are (i) no significant\nincrease in O C S was observed following the massive\nMt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption; (ii) a marginally significant HCN\nincrease was measured over this 9 112-year span; and (iii) both\nSF6 and CHClF2 are accumulating rapidly in the lower stratosphere with rates of increase generally consistent with previously\npublished measurements for the same time period.\nAcknowledgments.

Stratospheric volume mixing ratio profiles of\ncarbon tetrafluoride, CF4, obtained with the Atmospheric\nTrace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) instrument during\nthe ATLAS (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and\nScience) -3 mission of 1994 are reported. Overall the profiles\nare nearly constant over the altitude range 20 to 50 km,\nindicative of the very long lifetime of CF4 in the atmosphere.\nIn comparison to the stratospheric values of CF4 inferred from\nthe ATMOSISpacelab 3 mission of 1985, the 1994 wncentrations are consistent with an exponential increase of (1.6\n0.6) %/yr. This increase is discussed with regard to previous\nresults and likely sources of CF4 at the ground. Further, it is\nshown that simultaneous measurements of N20 and CF4\nprovide a means of constraining the lower limit of the\natmospheric lifetime of CF4at least 2,300 years, two sigma.\n\n*\n\nIntroduction\nAtmospheric carbon tetrafluoride (CF4, also referred to as\ntetrafluoromethane, perfluoromethane, FC-14) is thought to\nhave both natural and anthropogenic sources at the ground\n[i.e., Cicerone, 1979; Penkett et al., 1981; Fabian et al.,\n19871 but their identification and relative strengths have not\nbeen well established so far.

Thus, it is expected to be\nuniformly mixed both geographically and vertically around the\nglobe and to have a large "global warming potential" (GWP)\ndue to its absorption characteristics in the infrared (IR) [Roehl\net al., 19951. The GWP is a measure of the potential globally\naveraged warming effect caused by the emission of a set\namount (e.g., 1 kg) of a trace gas. The total warming depends\nnot only on the GWP but also on the total emissions; while\nCF4 has a large GWP, its current global emission and its\ncorresponding impact on the climat system remain small (see\nIPCC, 1995).\nMeasurements of tropospheric CF4 mixing ratios by\nGassmann [I9741 over Europe and by Ras?nussen et al.\n\'Institute of Astrophysics-University of LiBge, LiBge, Belgium\nWOAA Aeronomy Laboratory, Boulder, CO, USA\n\'University of Denver Physics Department, Denver, CO, USA\n\'ASD NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, USA\n\'Jet Propulsion Laboratory, CalTec, Pasadena, CA, USA\n6SAIC- NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, USA\n\'Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA\n"University of Alabama at Huntsville, AL, USA\n91MK-ForschungszentrumKarlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany\n\n-\n\n-\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GL00957\n\n0094-8534196196GL-00957$05.00\n\n[I9791 and Penkett et al.

Stratospheric\nvalues have been measured locally by Gold~nan al. [1979],\net\ni.e., 75 pptv at 25 km altitude, and over extended altitude\nranges by Fabian and Goemer [I9841 and by Fabian et al.\n[1987]. IR-remote measurements of the concentration versus\naltitude of CF4 throughout the stratosphere and upper\ntroposphere were reported by Zander et al. [1987, 19921,\nbased on observations with the ATMOS (Atmospheric Trace\nMolecule Spectroscopy) instrument during the Spacelab-3\nmission of 1985; they suggested that CF4 has a nearly\nconstant VMR ratio up to at least 50 km.\nFrom the analysis of air samples collected at the South Pole\nin 1978-79 and 1984, Khalil and Rasmussen [I9851\nconcluded that CF4accumulates in the Earth\'s atmosphere at a\nrate of about 2 % or 1.3 pptv/yr, which corresponds to a global\nemission of 1 . 8 ~ 1 0gms/yr; they suggested that the most\n\'~\nlikely anthropogenic source of CF4 may be from releases\nassociated with electrolytic aluminum and steel reduction\nprocesses (see also Penkett et al., 1981).\nIn this Letter, we report volume mixing ratio profiles of CF4\nretrieved from IR solar occultation observations with the\nATMOS instrument during the 1994 ATLAS3 mission and\ncompare these with revised CF4 profiles derived from the\nATMOSISpacelab-3 flight of 1985. We also report an\nestimate of the lower limit of the lifetime of CF4 in the atmosphere, based on NzO concentrations measured simultaneously.\n\n*\n\nData Base and Analysis\nThe bulk of the results reported here have been derived\nfrom 0.01 cm-\' resolution infrared solar spectra obtained in the\noccultation mode with the ATMOS fast Fourier transform\nspectrometer [Farmer et al., 1987; Gunson et al., 19961 in\nlow Earth orbit during the ATLAS-3 mission of November 312, 1994.\nThe spectral region analyzed for CF4 VMR profile\nretrievals extends from 1282.2 to 1285.2 cm", and includes\nthe 0 branch as well as a number of unresolved R branch\n.\nmanifolds of the very strong v3 band of the target molecule.\nTarget and major interfering absorptions by C& and N20\n(also C02, H20, HN03 and C10N02 below 30 km) are\naccounted for in an iteration fitting sequence using the\nspectroscopic parameters maintained in the ATMOS line\nparameters compilation described by Brown et al. [1996]. In\nparticular, the CF4 VMRs reported here were derived with a\nrealistic set of spectroscopic parameters used previously\n[Brown et al., 1987; ~ a n d e r al., 19871 but scaled by\nei\nfactor of 1.4 to account for new band strength estimates made\nby one of us (A.G.) using the CF4 v3 cross-sections reported\n\n2353\n\n2354\n\nZANDER ET AL.: INCREASE OF STRATOSPHERIC CF,\n\nby McDaniel et al. [1991]. Forward calculations and\nnonlinear least-squares spectral fittings were made with the\nODs (Occultation Display Spectra) algorithm described by\nNorton and Rinsland [ 199I]. Details about data processing,\nretrieval procedure aid &cillary input parameters are\ndiscussed by Gunson et al. [I 9961.\nAll sunset occultations that occurred between 3 and 49ON\nand encompassed the v3 band of CF4 have been analyzed\nconsistently as part of t e ATMOS - "Version 2" data set; they\nh\ncomprise 17 a i d 30 events observed with filters Nr. 9 (600:\n2450 cm-\') and Nr. 12 (600-1400 cm-I), respectively. This\nrepresents the largest single set of measurements which\nbroadly overlaps the latitudes (25 to 32ON) of the 1985\nATMOS observations [Zander et al., 19871. Averages\ncorresponding to subsets of spectra binned over specific\nlatitude and altitude ranges were also analyzed for consistency\nof the results. Such averages improve signal-to-noise ratios of\nthe resulting spectra, thus extending the range of detectability\nof the weak CF4features to higher altitudes. Typical examples\nof sample spectra covering the interval fitted for CF4retrievals\nhave been reported in Figs. 17 and 18 of Zander et al. [1987],\nshowing the weakness of the target absorption features in the\nupper stratosphere and the extent of interfering absorptions\nbelow 30 km.\nIn addition to the northern sunset occultations mentioned\nbefore, the present analysis also evaluated CF4 VMR profiles\nfrom the 14 filter Nr. 9 and 27 filter Nr. 12 sunrise\noccultations that occurred between 65 and 72\' southern\nlatitudes, both inside and outside the Antarctic vortex. CF4\nVMRs derived from ATMOS 0bServations during the\nATLAS-1 (03124 to 04/02/92) and ATLAS-2 (04108 to 16,\n1993) missions are also reported for consistency.\n\nResults and Discussion\nFigure 1 reproduces VMR profiles of CF4derived from the\nATMOSIATLAS-3 occultations observed at northern\nlatitudes, over the pressure range from about 1 to 50 mb (-50\nto 20 km altitude). The increased scatter of the VMRs above\n40 km is the result of the weakening of the target absorption\nfeatures at high altitudes, while the curvature near the bottom\nof the profiles reflects a systematic effect resulting from the\n"Version-2" retrieval process and strong interfering absorption\nfeatures. Local excursions of the data-around the means are\nlikely to result from propagation of errors associated with the\nonion-peeling retrieval method adopted here. One-sigma\nrandom errors with which individual profiles can be retrieved\nare discussed and documented by Gunson et al. [I9961 and\nAbrams et al. [1996]. Except where mentioned specifically,\nand because of the large number of occultations involved in\nthis analysis, the standard deviations are representative of the\nprecision assigned to the reported VMR profiles.\nA characteristic feature that emerges from the CF4 profiles\ndisplayed in Fig. 1 is their near-constant VMR in the stratosphere. The thick continuous and dotted vertical lines represent\nthe average VMRs corresponding to the arithmetic means of\nthe individual sunset profiles binned according to the ATMOS\nfilter Nr. 9 and filter Nr. 12, respectively. These as well as\nsimilar averages derived from the ATLAS3 sunrise occultations lie within the 71 to 76 pptv range (the filter Nr. 9 results\nwhich extend only over the 20 to 40 km altitude range for\nquality reasons, are slightly larger (-2%) than those obtained\nfrom filter Nr. 12) with their mean of 73.5 pptv having a\nstandard deviation of 2.7 pptv and a precision of 3 pptv.

The same analytical\nprocedure was adopted for both 1985 and 1994 retrievals, in\norder to eliminate any biasing problem among all results\nreported in this Letter. The mean CF4 volume mixing ratios\nretrieved here are summarized in Table 1.\nThe relative constancy of the VMR profiles versus altitude\nand latitude is indicative of the long lifetime of CF4 in the\natmosphere. This has already been suggested in earlier\ninvestigations [i.e., Cicerone, 19791 and was confumed more\nrecently by Ravishankara et al. [1993] and Morris et al.\n[I9951 who re-evaluated all likely destruction mechanisms of\nCF4 in the Earth\'s atmosphere and concluded that its lifetime\nmay be as long as 25,000 to 50,000 years.\nWhile constant VMR profiles (which would correspond to\nan infinite lifetime) were assumed in the above CF4 trend\nevaluation, a more detailed binning versus height (at pressure\nlevels consistent with the UARS pressure grid) reveals a weak\ndecrease of the CF4 VMRs with increasing altitude. This\ndecrease derived from the large set of ATMOSIATLAS-3\nobservations is statistically significant and can be used as an\nobservational constraint on the lower limit of the atmospheric\nlifetime of CF4.\nA sound approach for its evaluation was based on\ncorrelations between simultaneous measurements of CF4 and\nN20, both being long-lived gases for which the steady state\nratio of gradients can be assumed to be proportional to their\nlifetimes [Plumb and KO, 19921.

The slope of the straight line fitted to all data points in\nFig. 2 is equal to 1.8944~10-~;\nassuming that N20 has a\nlifetime of 120 years [ WMO-Report Nr. 37, 19951, this slope\ntranslates into a "first order" lifetime of CF4 ranging from\n1,100 to 3,800 years, two sigma. A similar evaluation\nperformed by one of us (S.S., private report) based on\nATMOSISpacelab 3 measurements of CF4 [Zander et al.,\n19921 and N 2 0 [Gunson et al., 19901 led to a range of CF4\nlifetimes between 1,500 and 5,800 years.\nHowever, a more realistic analysis must account for nonsteady state effects due to (i) the NzO increase at a rate of 0.3\nY01yr [W/iO-Report Nr. 25, 1992; Zrnlder et al., 19941, (ii)\nthe CF4increase at a rate of 1.6 %Iyr derived above and (iii) a\ntroposphere-stratosphere mixing time of 4 years. One then\n\n2355\n\nfinds a more representative CF4 lifetime lying between 2,300\nyears and infinity, 2 sigma. We believe that the 2,300 years\nminimum lifetime of CF4 in the atmosphere is a useful\nconstraint for assessing that molecule\'s impact on our\nenvironment. Similar long lifetimes for CF4 have been\nsuggested by von Clarmann et al. [I9951 and based on\nMarkIV-balloon measurements [B. Sen, private cornmunication, 19951. It should be noted that the CF4 lifetime\nevaluation is insensitive to any systematic bias of the\nspectroscopic parameters used in the retrieval process,\nprovided that such a bias applies similarly throughout the\naltitude range involved.\nConcern may be raised about the above procedure\'s\nvalidity. Its applicability was assessed for various long-lived\ngases such as CC12F2, CC13F, SFs,..., measured simultaneously with N 2 0 during the ATMOS missions. For example,\nthe application to CC12F2performed for 3 latitudinal zones,\ni.e., midlatitudes (49-3S0N), subtropics (35-20\xc2\xb0N) and tropics\n(20-3"N), all encompassed by sunset occultations during the\nATLAS3 mission, returned lifetimes of CC12F2 for these\nzones equal to 121, 104 and 94 years, respectively. These\nvalues are in excellent agreement with the mean global range\nof 102 to 111 years reported in W O - N r . 18 [I9891 and\nWMO-Nr. 37 [I9951 and reflect the latitudinal dependence of\nthe lifetime, in particular its shorter value in the tropics where\nupward transport favours faster intrusion to altitudes where\nphotodissociation proceeds.\nHow do the present results compare with other findings\nabout atmospheric CF4?\nThe atmospheric lifetime derived here points to a minimum\nvalue of 2,300 years, ranging up to many thousands of years.\nThe (1.6 + 0.6) %/yr rate of CF4 increase throughout the\nstratosphere derived for the period separating the ATMOS\nmission of 1985 and 1994 is commensurate with (i) the 2\n%/yr increase derived by Khalil and Rasniussen [I9851 for the\n65 pptv tropospheric background loading of CF4 at the south\npole between 1978 and 1984, and (ii) the 2.5 %lyr increase\n\nATMOS / ATLAS3\nNovember 3-12,1994\n\n0\nO\n\nSunsets, Filter 9\nSunsets, Filter 12\nSlope = 1.8944 x 10"\n\nN,O VOLUME MIXING RATIO (ppbv)\n\nFigure 2.

This is\nan important outcome, since the extremely long lifetime\n(minimum of 2,300 years) for carbon tetrafluoride in the\natmosphere, leads to a GWP which is among the largest\nreported thus far [IPCC, 19951. The upcoming ATMOS data\nprocessing will incorporate improvements in the CF4\nspectroscopic data base [Brownet al., 1996; A. Goldman and\nP. Varanasi, private communications] and is expected to\nreduce the absolute uncertainties of the findings presented\nhere. The need for spectroscopic parameters about "new", non\ntraditional molecules whose interest has emerged during the\nlast decade (this is certainly the case for CF4) is stressed here;\nit should be performed in the laboratory under experimental\nspectral resolution conditions achieved with current state-ofthe-art field instruments and span temperature and pressure\nranges encountered throughout the entire lower and middle\natmosphere.\nAcknowledgements This work was carried out within the overall\nATMOS activities conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),\nCalifornia Institute of Technology, under contract with the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

This is some 37% larger than the mean 2.58 ppbv\nvalue measured by ATMOS within the same latitude zone\nduring the Spacelab 3 flight of 29 April to 6 May 1985,\nconsitent with an exponential growth rate of the chlorine\nloading in the stratosphere equal to 3.3%/yr or a linear\nincrease of 0.10 ppbvlyr over the Spring-1985 to Fall-1994\ntime period. These findings are in agreement with both the\nburden and increase of the main anthropogenic C1-bearing\nsource gases at the surface during the 1980s, confirming that\nthe stratospheric chlorine loading is primarily of anthropogenic origin.\n\nIntroduction\nThe ATMOS experiment is a multi-mission, shuttle-based\nproject designed for regular, detailed remote soundings of the\nEarth\'s middle atmosphere [Farnrer, 1987; Gunson et at.,\n19961.\nIInstitute of Astrophysics, University of LiBge, Belgium\n2 ~ ePropulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, CA\nt\n3~cience\nApplications International Corporation, Hampton, VA\n4~~~~ Marshall Space Flight-Center, AL\n5 ~ a v aResearch Laboratory, Washington, DC\nl\n6~orschungszentrum,\nJtilich, Germany\n\'university of Denver, Denver, CO\n\'~aliforniaInstitute of Technology, CA\nWniversity of Bern, Switzerland\n\'O~awardUniversity, Cambridge, MA\n"university of Alabama, Huntsville, AL\n\'*NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA\n\' 3 ~ ~ ~ - ~ o r s c h u n g s z e n tKarlsruhe, Germany\nrt~m\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union\nPaper number 96GL01792\n0094-8534196196GL-01792$05.00\n\nDuring its first mission of 1985, ATMOS demonstrated the\ncapability of establishing the budget of and partitioning\namong the nitrogen, chlorine and fluorine "families" [Russell\net al., 1988; Zander et al., 19921 through infrared remote\nsensing from space.

By complementing these with profiles of\n4 additional, non-negligible chlorinated species measured by\nother experiments, and the COClF contribution from model\ncalculations, we evaluate the 1994 stratospheric C1 budget and\nderive its rate of change between 1985 and 1994.\n\nData base and analysis\nThe main absorption features used for VMR retrievals of\nthe chlorine-bearing target molecules observed by ATMOS\nare primarily those reported in Table 1 of Zander et al. [1992].\nThis involves analyzing the ATMOS observations with the\nfilters # 12 (600-1400 cm\'l), # 9 (600-2450 cm-\') and # 3\n(1580-3420 cm-I) which were used alternately during the\nATLAS-3 mission in predetermined sequences during 68\nsunset occultations that occurred between 20 and 49"N. In\norder to appraise the latitudinal dependence of the VMR\nprofiles, we subdivided this range into "midlatitude" (49 to\n35"N) and "subtropical" (35 to 20\xc2\xb0N) zones. The molecules\nHCl and CH3Cl are studied in filter 3 occultations, while all\nother ATMOS-retrieved gases are from Filter 9 and 12 events;\nto eliminate any biasing arising from the sampling of the\nensembles of the filter 3 or the filter 9 and 12 occultations, we\nused N 2 0 as a dynamical tracer to register HCl and CH3Cl\nprofiles on the same vertical scale as the other gases.\nThe VMR profiles were retrieved with the ODs\n(Occultation Display Spectra) onion-peeling retrieval algorithm developed at JPL and described by Norton and Rinsland\n[I99 11. The input data to the code and parameters necessary to\nretrieve consistent composition of the atmosphere are\ndiscussed by Gunson et a/. [I 9961.\nThe adoption of temperature-dependent absorption crosssections for a number of heavy molecules such as CC12F2,\nCC18, CHC1F2 and C10N02, instead of more subjective\nparameters used before [Zander et a/.,1987; Brown et al.,\n19871 greatly improved the absolute quality of related\nATMOS retrievals used here [Brown et a/., 19961.\n\n2358\n\nZANDER ET AL. : 1994 BUDGET OF STRATOSPHERIC CHLORINE\n\nResults\nThe mean HCl VMR value obtained by averaging all\nindividual measurements made during the ATLAS-3 mission\nnear and above 50 km altitude, and over the 3 to 49ON latitude\nzone was found equal to (3.52 0.10) ppbv. Sub-binnings\nperformed over the northern midlatitude and subtropical zones\nidentified here indicate no statistically significant difference\nwith respect to that mean, thus confirming that HCI is well\nmixed at the hemispheric level near and above the stratopause.\nPrevious ATMOS missions also demonstrated that the VMR\nmeasurement of HCl in the vicinity of the stratopause is a\ngood surrogate for total stratospheric chlorine loading [Zander\net al., 1992; Gunson et al., 19941. Therefore, the value of\n(3.52 f 0.10) ppbv for HCl near 50 km should represent the\nmean stratospheric loading of chlorine for the Fall-1994 time.\nTo corroborate this, we evaluated the burden of chlorine,\nClmT, at various pressure levels by summing measured VMRs\nof the largest possible set of C1-bearing gases (sources, sinks\nand reservoirs combined) weighted by the number of Cl atoms\nbound in each of them. For the ATLAS-3 time period, we\nperformed the following summation:\n\n*\n\nClmT= [HCl] + [C10N02]+ 4x[CC14]+ 3x[CCl$]\n\nwhere the brackets indicate the VMRs of the seven important\nchlorinated constituents measured by ATMOS, and the 4\nbraces referring to VMRs of additional, non-negligible\nchlorine contributors not retrieved by ATMOS but by other\nexperiments. In particular, the C10 data were derived from the\nMAS (Millimeter-wave Atmospheric Sounder) experiment\n[Croskey et al., 19921 which was also part of the ATLAS-3\npayload; details about the C10 data analysis have been\n\nATMOS I ATLAS3\nNovember 3 -12,1994\n\nVOLUME MIXING RATIO\n\nFigure 1.

The VMR profiles for\nCH3CC13and C2C13F3\nwere derived from in situ measurements\nduring a balloon flight performed by the Jiilich group (A.\nEngel, private communication) in Aire-sur-l\'Adour, France, on\n7 October 1994, i.e., about one month prior to the ATLAS3\nmission. The HOCl profile was obtained from the analysis of\nsunset spectra recorded with the Mark IV F T R during a\nballoon flight in September 1993 near 32ON (G.C. Toon,\nprivate communication), scaled by a 3% \'increase per year to\nrepresent the HOCl loading at the time of the ATLAS3\nmission. The double braced COClF VMRs were extrapolated\nfrom model calculations by Kaye et al., [1991], assuming a\n3%/yr increase between their 1990 evaluations and 1994.\nFigure 1 displays the profiles of the individual gases\nincluded in the present evaluation for both the midlatitude\n(thin full lines) and the subtropical (thin dotted lines) zones,\nas well as the corresponding total C1 profiles labeled Clm\ndisplayed as thicker lines. For CH3CC13,C2Clg3,HOCl and\nCOCIF, the same profiles were used in both binnings, because\nof unavailable measurements for the two latitudinal zones.\nTable 1 provides numerical values for CITm and CC$ for\nthe two northern midlatitude and subtropical zones; the\npressure levels were selected among standard values adopted\nby various experiments (including UARS) for date archiving.\nThe VMRs of the top and bottom pressure levels of the\nmidlatitude Clm profile (thick continuous line in Fig. 1) are\nequal, respectively, to 3.52 and 3.74 ppbv, with a\ncorresponding mean VMR and standard deviation over the\nentire altitude span equal to (3.54 Lt 0.09) ppbv. The extremes\nare indicative of a 6.3% decrease of CITm which can be\nexplained by the time delay for air to mix between 100 and\n0.68 mbar (-16.5 to 50 km) levels.\nThe CIToTprofile for the subtropical latitudinal zone (thick\ndotted line in Fig. 1) also indicates a decrease of 6.3% between\nbottom (3.72 ppbv) and top (3.50 ppbv) VMRs, with a\ncorresponding mean mixing ratio and standard deviation\nequal to (3.52 f 0.09) ppbv.\nFigure 2 with its linear abscissa scale shows some details\nof the profiles of the key components which make up the C1\ninventory for the northern midlatitude case (35 to 49\').

[1996].\nFrom the various independent results derived here, it can be\nconcluded that the overall chlorine loading at the top of the\nstratosphere over the 20 to 49ON latitudinal zone was equal to\n3.51 ppbv at the time of the November 1994 ATLAS-3\nmission, with a I-sigma uncertainty of 0.15 ppbv or 4%; this\nuncertainty represents an estimated accuracy assessed as in\nprevious investigations [Zander et al., 1990; Gunson et al.,\n19901. Throughout the stratosphere, the CIToTVMR profiles\ncombining the important sources, sinks and reservoirs display\nconsistent values which suggest only second order local deficit\nFigure 2.

This\ndiscrepancy is not resolved by new rates for the reactions\nC1+CH4 and OH+HCl derived from weighted fits to laboratory\nmeasurements. A deficit in modeled [HCl] and corresponding\noverprediction of [ClNO,] and [CIO], which increases with\naltitude, suggests that production of HCl between 20 and 50\nkm is much faster than predicted from recommended rates.\n\nIntroduction\nIdentifying and determining the rates of reactions involved\nin partitioning inorganic chlorine is critical to understanding\nthe processes that regulate stratospheric ozone. Collections\nof recommended rates published by NASA [DeMore et al.,\n19941 and NIST [Atkinson et al., 19921, referred to below as\nNASA94 and NIST92, have been invaluable for consolidation\nand review of the vast amount of kinetic information for\nhundreds of reactions. Nevertheless, models incorporating\nrecommended reaction rates and absorption cross sections and\nallowing for production of HC1 only via reactions of C1 with\nhydrocarbons and H 0 2 underpredict abundances of HCI and\noverpredict those of C1NO3, C10, and HOCl at altitudes above\n-24 km [e.g., McElroy and Salawitch, 1989; Allen and\nDelitsky, 1991; Natarajan and Callis, 1991; Stachnik et al.,\n19921. This discrepancy leads to an overprediction of ozone\nloss rates by an estimated 5 3 0 % near 40 km [Brasseur et al.,\n1985; Natarajan and Callis, 19911.\nPrevious suggestions for resolving the disagreement\nbetween theory and observation involve increasing the\nproduction of HC1 either by enhancing the rate of\nCl+H02+HCl+02 [Allen and Delitsky, 19911 or by including a\nchannel for HCl formation from the reaction ClO+OH\n[McElroy and Salawitch, 1989; Natarajan and Callis, 1991;\nStachnik et al., 19921.\nl ~ i vof Applicd Sciences, Haward Univ., Cambridge, MA\n.\n2 ~ ePropulsion Lab., Calif.

We conclude that (1) modifications to recommended rates\nfor Cl+CH, and OH+HCl, based on published laboratory\nmeasurements, are insufficient to reconcile the differences\nbetween modeled and measured partitioning of inorganic\nchlorine, and (2) a mechanism leading to enhanced formation\nof HCl, such as C10+OH+HC1+O2, is required to resolve these\ndifferences.\n\nStratospheric llleasurements\nMeasurements of [ClNO,] and [HCl] made by ATMOS and\n[ClO] by MAS are shown by the symbols in Fig. 1 (1 denotes\nvolume mixing ratio). Each ATMOS vertical profile is an\naverage of Version 2 retrievals from 3 to 6 occultations\n[Abrams et al., this issue]. Profiles were selected by (1) the\ngeographic location (65-69"N, 161-298"E for the extra-vortex\nhigh latitude case, 40-48"N, 39"W-27"E for the midlatitude\ncase, and 3-13"N, 187-343"E for the tropical case) and (2) the\nrequirement that [O,] not differ by more than -10% from the\nmean for each occultation used. The error bars were derived\nfrom the standard deviation of a weighted average of the\nmeasurements, added in quadrature to the systematic error\nassociated with uncertainties in the pressure-temperature\nretrieval and band strength for each constituent [Abrams et al.,\nthis issue]. The data were weighted by the inverse square of the\nrandom error generated in the retrieval process. The purple\ntriangles represent the sum of measured [ClNO,], [HCl], and\n[ClO], which agrees to within 10% with the value of [Cly]\n\nI\n\nMlCHELSEN ET AL.: STRATOSPIERIC CHLORINE PARTITIONING\nderived from measurements of organic source gases\n[Woodbridge et al., 1995; Zander et al., this issue].\nHC1 comprises most of Cly at all altitudes and latitudes (see\nFig. 1). The ratio [ClNO,]/[HCl] has a maximum of -0.5 at 26\nkm. Higher values for this ratio were observed by ATh/lOS\nduring ATLAS-2 for air believed to be recovering from PSC\nprocessing. The magnitude of this ratio and its near\ninvariance with latitude above -20 km is consistent with\nUARS observations [Dessler et al., 19951.

Partitioning between HC1 and C10N02 and among\nthe main components of the reactive nitrogen family (NO, NO2,\nHN03, C1ONO2, N2 0 5 , and H02N02) has been studied inside\nand outside the Antarctic stratospheric vortex based on ATMOS\nprofiles measured at sunrise during the 3-12 November 1994\nATLAS3 Shuttle mission. Elevated mixing ratios of HCl in the\nlower stratosphere with a peak of -2.9 ppbv\nparts per\nvolume) were measured inside the vortex near 500 K potential\ntemperature (-19 km). Maximum CIONOz mixing ratios of -1.2,\n-1.4, and -0.9 ppbv near 700 K (-25 km) were measured inside,\nat the edge, and outside the vortex, respectively. Model\ncalculations reproduce the higher levels of HCl and NO,\n(NO + NO2) inside the lower stratospheric vortex both driven by\nphotochemical processes initiated by low 0 3 . The high HC1 at\nlow O3 results from chemical production of HCl via the reaction\nof enhanced C1 with CH4, limited production of C10N02, and the\ndescent of inorganic chlorine from higher altitudes.\n\nIntroduction\nThe critical role of active chlorine in the winter and springtime\ncatalytic destruction of stratospheric O3 in polar regions has been\nwell established through ground-, aircraft-, and satellite-based\nmeasurements [cf. World Meteorological Organization (WMO),\n1995, Chapt. 31. Reactive nitrogen is also important in polar O3\nlosses, especially over Antarctica where it is irreversibly removed\nover large portions of the vortex through the sedimentation of polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles (denitrification) [Fahey\netal., 19901. Low levels of reactive nitrogen inhibit the\nformation of C10N02 when sunlight returns in spring, thereby\nallowing active chlorine to persist and catalytic O 3 destruction to\ncontinue inside the vortex [e.g., Brune et al., 19911.\nA primary objective of the Atmospheric Laboratory for\nApplications and Science (ATLAS)-3 Shuttle mission from 3-12\nNovember 1994, was to obtain sets of volume mixing ratio\n\n-j\n-<\n.\n\nr-\n\nY\n\n-*/,\n-A\n\nC\n\n),/+)\n\n-2\n<\n.\n\n.->\n\n./+\n\ncr\'\n\n28/7I.7\n\n(VMR) profiles at high southern latitudes during the photochemical recovery phase of the Antarctic ozone hole. We report here\nAtmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) observations of inorganic chlorine and reactive nitrogen species inside\nand outside the vortex. A photochemical model was used to\ninterpret the measurements.\n\nObservations and Spectral Analysis\nThe ATMOSIATLAS-3 Antarctic measurements were\nrecorded during sunrises between 64.53 and 72.43 latitude. The\nmeasurements reported here were obtained by combining nearly\nspatially and temporally coincident observations with filters 3\n(1580-3420 cm-l) and 12 (625-1400 cm- l). The 6 principal\ncomponents of the reactive nitrogen (NOy) family, NO, NO2,\nHNO,, ClONO,, N2 05, and H02N02, plus HCl, N20, and O 3\nwere measured.\nDiurnal corrections were included in the NO and NO, retrievals presented here [Newchurch et al., 19961. Random &or\nbars, which vary with altitude and species, are shown in the plots.\nTotal systematic errors (1 sigma) were HCl (5%), CIONOz\n(20%), NO (5%), NO2 (6%). HN03 (16%), N,OS (16%), and\nH02N02 (20%) [ A b r m et al., 1996al. The effective vertical\nresolution of the ATMOS measurements was -2 to 4 km.\n\nMeasurement Results\nFigure 1 presents an overview of the Antarctic measurements\nof [HCl] (top), [C10N02] (middle), and [ g ] (bottom) (where [x]\ndenotes the species VMR) plotted versus longitude and potential\ntemperature (0).Longitude is a useful coordinate because the\nmeasurements were recorded over a narrow latitude range, and\nthe vortex remained at similar longitudes throughout the mission\n(-240" to 315"E) [Manney et al., 19961. The vortex is apparent in\nthe [N20] contours overlayed in all of the panels.\nAbove 900 K, no [HCI] variations with longitude are apparent.\nZonal mean [HCl] decreased from 3.35 rt 0.42 ppbv at 2000 K\n(-50 km) to 3.09 rt 0.17 ppbv at 1550 K (-44 km), and 2.73\n0.09 ppbv at 1000 K (-34 km). Error limits denote standard deviations of the measurements. Below 800 K (-28 km), [HCl]\ninside the vortex was systematically higher than outside.

In the vortex interior (lower panel) NO, and HNO,\neach account for -50% of NOy below 700 K (-25 km).\nA photochemical model [Salawitch et al., 19941 was used to\ncompute the partitioning of total inorganic chlorine (Cly)and total\nreactive nitrogen\nfor the sets of\nmeasurements in\nFigures\nand 3.

Aerosol surface area profiles were taken\nfrom correlative SAGE 11 measurements (G. K. Yue and L. W.\nThomason, private communication, 1995).\nTwo sets of model calculations were performed. In the first,\nreaction rates and absorption cross sections from DeMore et al.\n[I9941 were assumed. In the second, the data of DeMore et al.\nwere again assumed except for modifications deduced from\nreanalysis of laboratory reaction rate data and comparisons\nbetween model calculations and ATMOS arctic, northern midlatitude, and tropical inorganic chlorine measurements [Michelsen\net al., 19961. For the present study, the most important change is\nthe assumption of a branching ratio of 7% for the C10 + OH\nreaction, leading to production of HCl.\nThe model calculations in Figures 2 and 3 reproduce the main\nfeatures of the measurements, highlighted by elevated [HCI] and\n[NOx]/[NOy], both driven by low [O,], and very low m205] at all\naltitudes inside the vortex. The low [N205] inside relative to outside the vortex is a consequence of the difference in the lengths of\nthe night. For the air sampled inside the vortex, the stratospheric\nsolar zenith angle never exceeds 92", preventing the nighttime\nbuildup of [N, O,]. The outside-the-vortex occultations were\nrecorded -4" equatorward, where the night was -4 hours long,\nallowing [ N 2 0 5to accumulate rapidly in darkness.\n~\nThe inorganic chlorine measurements inside the vortex are\nbetter reproduced by the modified model calculations (labeled\nretised) than by the standard run (labeled JPL94) based on the\ndata of DeMore et al.

Only a single set of model calculations is shown since\nthe 2 cases (described in the text) gave identical results except for\nC10N02. Measured H O z N 0 2 mixing ratios (not shown) were\nless than about 0.2 ppbv.\nMichelsen et al. [1996]. The differences between the two sets of\ncalculations for the outside-the-vortex case are smaller, and it is\nnot possible to distinguish between them given the measurement\nuncertainties.\nThe comparisons in Figure 3 show several systematic\ndiscrepancies: (1) the [N02]/[NO] ratio in the mid- to lower\nstratosphere was underpredicted by up to 50% both inside and\noutside the vortex, (2) [N205] was overpredicted outside the\nvortex above 800 K, and (3) the [NO,]/[NOy] ratio was\nunderpredicted in the lower stratosphere both inside and outside\nthe vortex. The discrepancy for N 0 2 / N 0 is consistent with either\nslower photolysis of NO2 than calculated, a faster rate for the\nreaction of N O wth 03,or some other process that rapidly\nconverts NO to NO2. The remaining discrepancies suggest a\nfaster rate for the conversion of N20S to H N 0 3 than calculated\nfrom heterogeneous and gas phase chemistry.\n\nConclusions\nATMOSIATLAS 3 measurements obtained in November 1994\nconfirm previous observations of high [HCl] and high [NO] in the\ninterior of the Antarctic lower stratospheric vortex during its recovery phase. Model calculations initialized with ATMOS\nspecies and temperature measurements plus correlative SAGE I1\naerosol surface areas successfully reproduce these key features of\nCly and NOy partitioning, confirming a basic understanding of\nthe chemistry, which is driven by very low to3].

The estimated uncertainty of\nthe 0 3 measurements ranged from 3 to 8 % between 100\nand 7 P a .\n\nResults and Discussion\nThe altitude of the tropopause was determined to be 13.5\nkm based on the observed temperature. The observed NO,\nand 0 3 profiles are shown in Figure 1. It can be seen that\nthe NO, values obtained during ascent and descent agree\nquite well. The NO, values increased with altitude up to 33\nkm,and they were about 1 ppbv at 15 km and reached 20\nppbv at 33 km. The 0 3 profile correlated well with that of\nNO, up to 23 km. Good correlation between NO, and 0 3 in\nthe lower stratosphere was reported by Murphy et al.\n[1993]. Between 23 and 32 km, the vertical gradient of 0 3\nbecame greater than that of NO,.\nThe N20 and CH4 profiles are shown in Figure 2. The\nmean N20 and CH4 profiles derived from eight balloon\nobservations are plotted as "reference" midlatitude profiles.\nThese measurements were made at 44"N in the fall of 1979,\n1982, 1985, 1988, 1990, and 1993. The present N20 and\nCH4mixing ratios generally decreased with altitude and the\n\nFigure 2. Vertical profiles of the N2O and CH4 mixing\nratios observed on October 12, 1994. The vertical bar\nindicates the range of the altitude where each sample was\ncollected. The solid line indicates the mean "reference"\nNzO profile for autumn at 44"N. The horizontal bar\nrepresents the one o standard deviation of the values used\nfor the reference profile.\n\nminimum N2O and CH4 values of 38 ppbv and 0.58 ppmv\nwere obtained at the highest altitude of 32 km, respectively.\nThe N20 values up to 26 km were very close to the\n"reference" mean values. However, at altitudes between 28\nand 30.5 km, the N2O values were considerably larger than\nthe mean values. Considering that NzO and C& mixing\nratios at these altitudes are larger in the tropics than at\nmidlatitudes [Jones and Pyle, 1984; Podolske et al., 19931,\nit is consistent to interpret that the airmasses measured at\nthese altitudes originated from lower latitudes. At 32 km,\nthe N20 value was again close to the mean value.\nIsentropic ten-day back trajectories do not indicate that the\nairmasses measured between 28 and 30.5 km were\ntransported from lower latitudes within 10 days (R. Kawa,\nprivate communication). This is not necessarily\ninconsistent with the observations considering that N20 and\nCH4 have lifetimes much longer than 10 days as discussed\nbelow.\nThe fine structures of the NzO and CH4 profiles are very\nsimilar as can be seen from Figure 2. In fact, NzO and CH4\nwere correlated very well with a correlation coefficient of\n0.995. A relationship between N20 and CH4 has been\nderived by Kawa et al. [I9931 based on a much larger data\nset obtained by in situ measurements.\nFigure 1. Vertical profiles of the NO, and 0 3 mixing ratios\nobserved on October 12, 1994.

The present NO, maximum value of\n20 ppbv was observed at 33.5 km, at altitudes where\nunfortunately N2O and CH4 were not measured.\nA slight deviation from this linearity is observed at\naltitudes between 28.6 and 30.6 km, where the N2O values\nwere between 70 and 110 ppbv.

NOy - N2O correlation calculated by the model\nfrom mid to low latitudes in October are shown in Figure 4.\nThe observed NOy values are generally close to those\ncalculated at 47ON. The calculated NO, values for the\nequator and 19"N are slightly higher than those at 47"N and\nagree with the NOy values observed between 28.6 and 30.6\nkm. In this way, the air parcels in this altitude region are\nconsistent with transport from lower latitudes based on the\nmodel correlations.\nThe ATMOS 1994 data indicate that NOy - NzO\nrelationship started to deviate from linearity at N2O mixing\nratios less than 35 ppbv (Figure 3). The deviation is\nprominent for N20 mixing ratios below 20 ppbv. Deviation\nfrom the linearity was also observed by the ATMOS at\n28"N and 48 "S in May 1985 at altitudes where NzO mixing\nratios were less than 25 ppbv [Fahey et al., 1990bl.

Using results from a time-dependent photochemical\nmodel to calculate the diurnal variation of NO and NO,, we have\ncorrected Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS)\nsolar-occultation retrievals of the NO and NO, abundances at 90\xc2\xb0\nsolar zenith angle. Neglecting to adjust for the rapid variation of\nthese gases across the terminator results in potential errors in retrieved profiles of -20% for NO, and greater than 100% for NO\nat altitudes below 25 km. Sensitivity analysis indicates that\nknowledge of the local 0, and temperature profiles, rather than\nzonal mean or climatological conditions of these quantities, is required to obtain reliable retrievals of NO and NO, in the lower\nstratosphere. Extremely inaccurate 0, or temperature values at 20\nkm can result in 50% errors in retrieved NO or NO,. Mixing ratios of NO in the mid-latitude, lower stratosphere measured by\nATMOS during the November 1994 ATLAS3 mission compare\nfavorably with in situ ER-2 observations, providing strong corroboration of the reliability of the adjusted space-borne measurements.\n\nIntroduction\nThe rapid temporal variation in the concentrations of NO\nand NO, at sunrise and sunset, if not properly accounted for,\nwill produce errors in the retrieval of these gases from solaroccultation measurements [Ken et al., 1977; Boughner et al.,\n1980; Roscoe and Pyle, 1987; Russell et al., 19881. We demonstrate that the correction for temporal variation is sufficiently sensitive to profiles of temperature and O3 that local\nvalues of these quantities, rather than zonal or climatological\nmeans, are necessary to return accurate profiles of NO and\nNO,. A coincidence between ATMOS and the NOAA NONO, sensor on the ER-2 during November 1994 reveals good\nagreement between corrected NO profiles measured by ATMOS and in situ measurements in the lower stratosphere.\n\n\'University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL\n\' ~ e tPropulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL\nCalifornia Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA\nSAIC - NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA\nNOAA Aeronomy Laboratory, Boulder, CO\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA\nHarvard University, Cambridge, MA\nNASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA\nlo University of Libge, LiBge, Belgium\n\n\'\n\n\'\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GLO 1196\n\n0094-8534196196GL-01196$05.00\n\n.\n\nI\n\n-\n\n,,\n.\n\n__ -\n\n+\n-2\n\n-,\n\n--, .\n-2 -I\n\n,\n.\n\'\n\nk\n?\n\nSensitivity of correction factors to adopted\nparameters\nThe variation of NO and NO, near the terminator is governed\nprimarily by the reaction of NO with 0, and by the photolysis of\nNO,. Hence, accurate knowledge of the local values of O,, temperature (due to the temperature dependence of NO + O,), and\nthe radiation field is required to calculate the variation of NO and\nNO, across the terminator. We used the CaltechIJPL onedimensional, time-dependent photochemical model [Allen and\nDalitsky, 1990, 19911 to calculate the diurnal variation of NO\nand NO,. As a validation of our model calculations, we compared\nthe computed variation of NO and NO, with observed diurnal\nvariation at several altitudes and geophysical conditions [Kondo\net al., 1989, 1990; Kawa et al., 1990; Webster et al., 19901. In all\ncases, the agreement was very good. For example, Figure 1\nshows a comparison of NO measurements at 20 km [Kawa et al.,\n19901 with the results of the model constrained by the measurements of 0, and temperature simultaneous with NO. With both\nmodel results and measurements normalized by the volume mixing ratio (VMR) at solar zenith angle (SZA) of 90\xc2\xb0, the agreement is excellent. The accuracy with which the model calculates\nthe relative variation of NO and NO, is the critical element for\ncorrecting solar-occultation retrievals. We calculated factors describing the diurnal variation of NO and NO, relative to the values at SZA=90\xc2\xb0 (either sunrise or sunset) at O.O1\xc2\xb0 increments and\nsubsequently smoothed to O.1\xc2\xb0 increments for use in the ATMOS\nonion-peeling reduction algorithm [Norton and Rinsland, 19911\nfollowing the methodology of Murcray et al. [I9781 and Rinsland\net al. [1984]. This methodology applies the calculated factors to\nthe measured slant columns during the onion-peeling retrieval\nprocess.\nSample model calculations show that the variation of NO and\nNO, at the terminator is not sensitive to assumptions concerning\nthe local values of NO, , H,O, CH,, the rates of heterogeneous\nreactions, or albedo variation. The sensitivities to prescribed 0,\nand temperature, however, are large enough to require using 0,\nand temperature measurements obtained simultaneously with the\nNO, (=NO+NO,) measurements to yield accurate, retrieved profiles. For example, an error of +/-50% in model O, at all altitudes results in an error in retrieved NO at SZA=90\xc2\xb0 of -101-55%\n[NO] and +12/-55% [NO, ] at 20 km. Model errors of +/-25% in\ntemperature result in somewhat smaller retrieval errors. These\nperturbations encompass potentially real deviations from climatological or zonal mean conditions; however, in the winter vortex, larger excursions may occur. The sensitivity to uncertainty in\nthe adopted values for model calculations of both 0, and temperature increases with decreasing altitude below 30 km. Because\nof the convolved effects of kinetics, photolysis, and slant-column\ngeometry, however, the sensitivity is not always monotonic in\n\n2374\n\nNEWCHURCH ET AL.: ATMOS NOx\n\n3o\n\n-\n\n,\n\nI\n\noccultation) obtained at 49O N is a typical mid-latitude sunset oc-\n\nModel\nzen v co1(3)1120\n\nImplications for ATMOS retrievals\n\ncultation with an 0, profile significantly different from the zonalmean O,, but with temperatures similar to the zonal mean. The\nretrieval that ignores the effects of diurnal variation (denoted NC)\nis the lowest of the three in the 10 to 30-km region. The retrieval\nthat uses correction factors from a model employing simultaneously acquired ATMOS 0, and temperature profiles (denoted\nPC) produces the highest values of NO. A retrieval using model\nresults based on zonal-mean profiles of 0, and temperature\n(denoted ZC) is intermediate to the other NO profiles. The PC\nretrieval abundances exceed l o NC measurement uncertainties\nbetween 16 and 18 km and also between 24 and 30 km. Figure 2b\nshows retrieved profiles of NO for sunrise occultation ATLAS3lSR09 (sunrise number 9) in the southern hemisphere vortex.\nThe NC retrieval yields roughly 50% of the amount of NO at 20\nkm compared to the PC retrieval. The ZC retrieval profile is quite\nsimilar to, and equally inaccurate as, the NC profile. The failure\nof the ZC retrieval is due to the extreme zonal variation of O, and\ntemperature at these latitudes, which encompass the polar vortex\n[Manney et al., this issue]. As shown in the fractional difference\nbetween PC and NC, the correction exceeds the I-sigma measurement uncertainty (dotted line) between 16 and 28 km. We also\nused the photochemical reconstniction model of Salawitch et al.\n[1994] to compute correction factors and obtained retrieved profiles of NO and NO, that differ from the PC values shown in Figures 2 and 3 by no more than 20%, significantly less than the uncertainty of the ATMOS measurement.\nSimilar analysis of other sunrise and sunset occultations reveals that the difference between PC and NC retrievals vary\nwidely among the occultations, but that significant corrections do\nnot occur above 30 km. Below 25 km, the true NO values may be\nas much as a factor of 5 larger than uncorrected values. Under\nsome circumstances (e.g., at high latitudes, 72.3" S, in SR68\nwhere the maximum SZA is only 91.77 the PC profile values are\nactually less than the uncorrected profile values. No clear differences between sunrise and sunset corrections emerge.\n\nNO profiles\n\nNO, profiles\n\nFigure 2a displays the profiles of NO using three different\ntreatments of the diurnal correction.

Simultaneous departures in both 0, and temperature\ngenerally compound the resulting error in the gas profile, but not\nnecessarily in a simple fashion.

Note that these corrections are in the direction opposite to the NO corrections.\n\nNEWCHURCH ET AL.: ATMOS NOx\nthan for NO. For example, as illustrated in Figure 2c for ATMOSIATLAS-3 SR09, the accurately corrected NO, abundances\n(PC) are typically 10-20% lower than uncorrected amounts (NC),\nwell in excess of the measurement uncertainties. Also, the approximate correction, ZC, is nearly the same as the NC profile. In\nanother case, ATMOSIATLAS-3 SSOl (not shown), both PC and\nZC profiles are -20% lower than the NC profile near 20 km.\nThese corrections are in the same sense, but of greater magnitude,\nthan previous estimates of approximately 5-10% Berr et al.,\n1977; Russell et al., 19881, possibly because of differences in\ntime (or SZA) resolution of the model calculations. While the ZC\ncorrections are typically 0-50% of the PC adjustments, sometimes\nthe ZC correction exceeds the PC adjustment. Above 40 km, we\nfind that PC profiles for NO, are typically lower that NC profiles\n(as has been illustrated for the lower stratosphere), but the corrections (less than 10%) are smaller than in the lower stratosphere. In addition, the corrections in the upper stratosphere are\ntypically smaller than the measurement uncertainties at those altitudes and smaller than one previous estimate uss sell et al.,\n19881.\nNO, profiles\n\nThe sum of diurnally corrected NO and NO2 amounts does\nnot necessarily equal the sum of uncorrected NO,. This difference is due to uncertainties in the inversion process; it is not a\nproperty of the model chemistry, which does conserve NO, to\nbetter than 3% at 20 km, for example. Typically, the difference between corrected and uncorrected NO, profiles varies\nby k IS%, roughly the measurement precision at 20 km. This\ndifference diminishes with increasing altitude, approaching\nzero at 30 km (above which altitude both NO and NO2 corrections become insignificant.) Below 20 km, where both NO\nand NO2 corrections increase in magnitude, the difference\n\nO0\n\nbetween corrected and uncorrected NO, can be as large as\n40% in the few occultations we have examined. However, the\nabsolute magnitude of the correction does not exceed 0.2\nppbv at any altitude, a small fraction of the NO, (=NO +NO2\n+ HN03 + CION02+ HNO, + 2*N205)budget.\nER-2 comparisons\n\nSome of the sunset occultation measurements obtained\nduring the early days of the ATMOS ATLAS3 mission occurred within 1 day and roughly coincident in space with in\nsitu measurements of NO on 4 November 1994, during the\nASHOEWESA ER-2 campaign. SSOl and SS24, while respectively 1 day before and 1 day after the ER-2 observations\non 4 November, yielded correlations of O3 and N20 very\nsimilar to the in situ observations [Chang et a]., this issue].\nChang et al. demonstrate good agreement between ATMOS\nand in-situ measurements of correlations between NO, and\nN20. Figure 3 illustrates a comparison of the space-borne\nATMOS and in situ measurements of NO [Fahey et al., 19891\nas a function of the long-lived tracer N 2 0 bowenstein et a].,\n19891 to account for variations in the precursors ( 0, and\nNO, ) that regulate levels of NO, in the sampled air masses.\nThe NC ATMOS profile values (open symbols) are shown for\nreference. We used the photochemical model to adjust the PC\nprofiles (not shown) for SSOl and SS24 to account for the\nchange in NO from SZA=90\xc2\xb0 to the ER-2 solar conditions of\nmid-day at SZA=72O. The scaling from 90\' to mid-day is approximately a factor of two at all altitudes reported in figure 3.\nThe good agreement between calculated and observed variation in NO with changing solar illumination illustrated in Figure 1 provides confidence in the fidelity of the scaling used to\nestimate the mid-day values of NO from the ATMOS sunset\nmeasurements. The agreement between NO measured by\nATMOS and the NOAA NO-NO, instrument shown in Figure 3 is well within the ATMOS 1-0 precision error bars. The\nsystematic error in these measurements is estimated to be 5%\nfor NO. The accuracy of the ER-2 NO measurements is 15%\nwith precision of 0.02 ppbv.\nThe ATMOS temperatures were approximately 5-10 K\nlower than the ER-2 temperatures at all altitudes. Adjustment\nfor this temperature difference would lower the ATMOS NO\nvalues by approximately 10-30% due to the temperature dependence of the rate of NO + 03, which increases with increasing temperature. This adjustment would degrade the\nagreement somewhat. At the lowest part of dive 2 (pressures\ngreater than lOOmb), the ER-2 encountered higher temperatures and lower values of NO. These lower NO values cluster\naround an average value of 0.1 ppbv at 280 ppbv N20. In situ\nmeasurements with temperatures greater than 223 K are unrepresentative of the comparable air mass and, therefore, are\nnot shown in Figure 3. Five points of the low-NO cluster remain in Figure 3. 12-Day back trajectory calculations initialized at 420 and 465 K indicate that air at the locations of\nSSOl and SS24, and at a number of ER-2 measurement locations, has similar history, having been drawn into midlatitudes from the subtropics. However, at 465 K, air from\nsome of the ER-2 measurement locations compared here, appears to have come from mid-latitudes around the developing\nvortex. A more complete comparison of spaceborne and in\nsitu measurements of NO requires accounting for the latitude\nand temperature histories of the air parcels, an analysis beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nI "\n" /\nATMOS SS24 uncorrected\nSSOI\n\n0\n225\n\n325\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\nATMOS SS24 uncorrected\n\nV\n\nI\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\nNO (ppbv)\n\n4\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nI\n\n030\n\nFigure 3.

The observations,\nmade during the Spacelab 3 and ATLAS-1, -2, and -3 shuttle\nmissions, cover polar, mid-latitude and tropical regions between 26 to 2.6 mb inclusive (=25 to 41 km). Average enrichments, weighted by molecular 4 8 0 3 density, of (15+6)% were\nfound for 6 6 8 0 3 and (1047)% for 68603. Defining the mixing\nratio of 500, as the sum of those for 6680, and 68603, an enrichment of (I&)% was found for 5003 (Lo standard deviation).\nNo latitudinal or vertical gradients were found outside this standard deviation. From a series of ground-based measurements by\nthe ATMOS instrument at Table Mountain, California (34.4ON),\nan average total column 66803 enrichment of (17W)% ( l o standard deviation) was determined, with no significant seasonal\nvariation discernable. Possible biases in the spectral intensities that affect the determination of absolute enrichments are\ndiscussed.\n\nIntroduction\nStratospheric enrichment of 5003 was first reported by\nMauersberger [1981], who found enrichments ranging from 0%\nto 40% using a balloon-borne mass spectrometer. (For the purposes of this paper, % enrichment = [R,bs/Rs,I -I] x 100,\nwhere Robs is the observed abundance ratio of the heavy isotopomer to the regular isotopomer, and Rstd is the standard\nratio. For 5003 enrichment, Rstd = 6.01~10-3,about three\ntimes the natural abundance ratio of 1 8 0 to 1 6 0 ignoring a very\nsmall abundance of 1 6 0 1 7 0 1 7 0 . See IUPAC [1983].) Further\nstratospheric enrichment of 5003 has been reported based on\nmass spectrometry [Mauersberger, 19871, far-infrared emission\nspectroscopy [Abbas et al., 1987; Carli and Park, 19881, and\ncryogenic grab-sampling followed by mass spectrometry\n[Schueler et al., 19901.

Using mass spectrometry, enrichment of 5003\nfrom about 8 to 10% in tropospheric urban air was reported by\nKrankowsky et al. [1995]; no apparent variation in the\nenrichment with tropospheric O3 mixing ratio was found.\nHeavy ozone enrichment has also been observed in laboratory measurements. Anderson et a l . [I9891 found ozone\ncreated using an electric discharge (which can produce excited\nstates of 0 and 0 2 ) was enriched primarily in the asymmetric\nisotopomers, such as 66803. Morton et al. [I9901 found that\nenrichment can occur via the reaction of ground-state atomic\nand molecular oxygen, O(3P) + 02(3Cg) + M + 0 3 + M, the socalled Chapman formation reaction; under these conditions,\nMauersberger et al. [1993] found enrichment only in the asymmetric isotopomers. Miller et al. [I9941 proposed that the\nreaction of vibrationally hot 0 2 (v t 26) with another O2\nmolecule can lead to heavy ozone enrichment via preferential\npotential energy curve-crossing of heteronuclear 0 2 from the\n02(lAg) to the 02(3Cg) state (see Valentini [1987]). However,\nappreciable production of such vibrationally hot O2 was predicted to occur only above about 35 km, with the enrichment\nproduced less than 5% at 40 km.\nWhile Miller et al. [I9941 may have provided an explanation for some of the enrichment in the mid-stratosphere, the\nbulk of the enrichment lacks a generally accepted theoretical\nexplanation. Indeed, detailed statistical mechanical analyses\nby Kaye and Strobe1 [1983] and Kaye [I9861 predicted a slight\ndepletion of 5003 under stratospheric conditions. This discrepancy between observation and theory indicates that current\nunderstanding of ozone formation is incomplete (see, for\nexample, Anderson et al. [1992]). However, a promising\nadvance in finding an enrichment mechanism is the recent discovery of several electronically excited states of ozone near the\ndissociation threshold [Anderson and Mauersberger, 19951. It\nis possible that the formation of ozone via the Chapman mechanism goes through one or more of these states whose quantum\nproperties (such as lifetime) are dependent on the isotopic composition of the reactants.\nFrom Figure 1, no vertical gradient consistently appears\nwithin the assembly of previous measurements, and data are\nlacking on latitudinal gradients in the stratosphere. In this\nstudy, we take advantage of the high vertical and latitudinal\nrange of the ATMOS data set from the Spacelab3 and ATLAS\nseries missions to constrain any vertical or latitudinal variability. We also evaluate 66803 column enrichments from\nground-based spectra taken from Table Mountain Facility\n(TMF), Wrightwood, California, (34.4"N, 117.7OW, 2.2 km\naltitude) to examine seasonal variations in the column\nenrichment from a mid-latitude site.\n\nData Acquisition\nInformation about the ATMOS instrument and its use on the\nshuttle can be found in Gunson et al. [this issue]. The spectral\nfilters used for analyses described here, filters 1, 9 and 12, had\nranges of 650-1 100 cm-1, 650-2450 cm-1, and 625-1400 cm-1\nrespectively. The number of vertical profiles used for this\nstudy were 4 from Spacelab 3, 39 from ATLAS-I, 29 from\nATLAS-2 and 87 from ATLAS-3. Using the ATMOS instrument\nfrom Table Mountain Facility (TMF), ground-based total column measurements were made on 48 separate days from\n\nTable 1.

For 4803,\nlarge spectral windows (from 14.5 to 16 cm-1 wide) covering\nregions of the v l , v2, and v3 bands were used for analyses,\nwhile additionally for the broadband filter 9, smaller windows\n(5 1 cm-1 wide) containing lines from the V , +VZ, I + V ~ ,\nV\nand\n2v2 bands were used. (A fuller discussion of ATMOS 4 8 0 3\nretrievals and comparison with other instruments may be found\nin M. C. Abrams et al., "An evaluation of stratospheric ozone\nobserved by the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy\n(ATMOS) Experiment During April 1992," in preparation for J .\nGeophys. Res., 1996.) For 66803, the narrow, unresolved v l\nband Q-branch centered at 1090.35 cm-1 was analyzed, as were\nseveral lines of the v3 band P-branch for 6 8 6 0 3 (see Table 1).\nSpectral parameters for all lines were from the ATMOS linelist\n[Brown et al., 19961, which currently incorporates the ozone\nparameters given by Flaud et al. [1986; 19901 and Carny-Peyret\net al. [1986]. Error sources for stratospheric measurements are\ndiscussed by Abrams et al. [this issue]. However, as discussed\nby Meier and Notholt [1996], an uncertainty exists in the\nspectral line intensities of 66803 due to what may have been an\nincorrect assumption for the isotopic makeup of the reference\ngas used in the experiments of Flaud et al. [I9861 and CamyPeyret et al. [1986]. Furthermore, any errors in the line intensities of 6 8 6 0 3 (which were derived from theory) will impact\nthose of 6680% AS will be seen, these uncertainties can affect\nthe interpretation of our results. The average l o random errors\nfor an enrichment from a single spectrum, mostly from signalto-noise error and interfering lines for spectral windows featuring the heavy isotopomers, are 20% for 68603 and 18% for\n66803.\n\nIRION ET AL.: HEAVY OZONE ENRICHMENTS FROM ATMOS\n\nTable 2.

No seasonal variation in the enrichment can be discerned. ignoring systematic\nerror, the average column enrichment is (17rt4)% ( l o standard\ndeviation), in good agreement with the 6 6 8 0 3 enrichment\nderived from the ATMOS stratospheric profiles. This is also in\nagreement with Meier and Notholt [I9961 for their solar\nspectra, (15.4+0.9)%, but higher than their average of (9.0\nE3.3)% for lunar spectra taken during the polar night.\n\n" U\n" ,\n\n(b)\n\nall\n- --\n\nNotes: (a) Interval width for all 4803\nwindows was 0.16 cm-I.\nThe window for 6"03 was 1090.35 cm-1 with a width of 0.5 cm-1.\n(b) Several unresolved lines between 1090.1 and 1090.6 cm-1\n(c) Sum of intensities between 1090.1 and 1090.6 cm-1\n(d) Average weighted by the intensities of the individual lines.\n\nFor the TMF ground-based retrievals of 4803 66803, an\nand\nassumed vertical ozone mixing ratio profile was scaled by a\nsingle multiplicative factor until a best fit was obtained between observed and calculated spectra. Assumed vertical ozone\nprofiles were created using monthly-averaged profiles from the\nJPL Lidar on TMF [McDermid, 19931. Vertical temperature and\npressure profiles were adapted from daily National Meteorological Center data and merged with the U.S. Standard Atmosphere [I9761 for higher altitudes. These profiles were then\nadjusted so that the atmosphere was in hydrostatic equilibrium.\nTo achieve better fits and improved consistency in the column\nretrievals among the different airmasses sampled within a day,\nthe height registration of the assumed ozone profiles was\nshifted vertically up to +3 km. Measurement of column 4 8 0 3\nby the ATMOS instrument at TMF was previously reported by\nGunson and Irion [1991], however, as some of the 4 8 0 3 lines\nused in that study may have been saturated at high airmasses,\nthe 4803 columns have been re-analyzed for this study. Table 2\ndescribes the lines used for TMF retrievals. The 68603 column\nfrom TMF was not retrieved because interference by neighboring 4803,H20 and CQ lines was too large to achieve acceptable fits. Random error for TMF retrievals, mostly from errors\nin the pressureftemperature profile and the assumed O3 profiles,\naveraged about 9% for the 66803 enrichments.\n\nResults\nThe solid lines in Figure 2 illustrate average vertical enrichment profiles for 66803 and 68603 measured by ATMOS over the\nfour shuttle missions, while the dashed lines indicate l o standard deviations. (The standard error for the average is nowhere\nmore than 2%.) The individual points on Figure 2 show enrichments averaged for latitude and mission and weighted by inverse square random error. For these latitudinal averages, the\nstandard errors average 8% for 66803 and 10% for 68603. No significant variation with latitude or altitude could be determined.\nFigure 1 illustrates previously published and the average\nATMOS S 0 0 3 enrichment profiles determined by averaging\nresults across constant pressure surfaces and assigning an approximate altitude.

Column 66803 enrichments from Table Mountain. The\nerror bars do not include systematic error.\n\nConclusions\nW e have analyzed A T M O S stratospheric spectra for the\nenrichments of 66803 and 6x603, and ground-based spectra for\nthe column enrichment of 66803. While some previous studies,\nmost notably M a u e r s b e r g e r [1981; 19871 and A b b a s e t a l .\n[1987], have s h o w n large vertical gradients, results here\nindicate that t h e vertical and latitudinal variability of t h e\nenrichment is generally small. W e can find n o discernable seasonal variability i n the 66803 column enrichment over Table\nMountain. T h e s e observations suggest the enrichment of\nheavy ozone i n the sunlit stratosphere is relatively constant,\nand perhaps only weakly regulated by temperature and pressure.\nAlthough previous studies have not ruled out other enrichment processes, laboratory measurements have shown the most\nsignificant enrichment in the Chapman reaction, with 0 and O 2\nreactants in the electronic ground state. Noting that the Chapman mechanism has been shown to produce no enrichment f o r\nthe 68603 isotopomer, our determination of a 68603 enrichment\nof (10*7)% ( l o standard deviation) suggests that the 68603 line\nintensities may b e biased too low by 10% with respect to t h e\nline intensities of 4 8 0 3 . However, it may b e possible that\nother unknown processes are operating to enrich stratospheric\n68603, much a s ozone produced in a n electric discharge becomes enriched in 68603. Furthermore, since the 66803 l i n e\nintensities derived by Carny-Peyret e t a l . [I9861 were determined making use of the 68603 line intensities, then if these\nare incorrect, the 66803 line intensities may also be too low.\nLaboratory measurement of the 66803 and 68603 spectral line\nintensities are necessary for calibration of the absolute stratospheric enrichments described here a n d t h e interpretation\nthereof. Since Flaud e t a l . [I9861 and Carny-Peyret e t a l .\n[I9861 reported good model fittings to their laboratory spectra,\nsuch laboratory measurements would probably produce a constant, corrective scaling of t h e line intensities (though n o t\nnecessarily the same amount for both isotopomers), and would\nnot affect the precision of the enrichments described here.\nAcknowledgements.

Stratospheric mixing ratios of CH3D from 100 mb to\n17mb (=15to 28 krn)and HDOfrom 100 mb to 10 mb (=I5 to 3 2\nkm) have been inferred from high resolution solar occultation\ninfrared spectra from the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) Fourier-transform interferometer. The spectra,\ntaken on board the Space Shuttle during the Spacelab 3 and\nATLAS-I, -2, and -3 missions, extend in latitude from 70"s to\n65"N. We find CH3D entering the stratosphere at an average\nmixing ratio of (9.9+0.8)~10-lowith a DIH ratio in methane\n(7.1+7.4)% less than that in Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW)\n( l o combined precision and systematic error). In the mid to lower\nstratosphere, the average lifetime of CH3D is found to be\n(1.19M.02) times that of CH4, resulting in an increasing DM\nratio in methane as air "ages" and the methane mixing ratio\ndecreases. We find an average of ( 1 . M . 1) molecules of stratospheric HDOare produced for each CH3D destroyed ( l o combined\nprecision and systematic error), indicating that the rate of HDO\nproduction is approximately equal to the rate of CH3D destruction.\nAssuming negligible amounts of deuterium in species other than\nHDO, CH3D and HD, this limits the possible change in the\nstratospheric HD mixing ratio below about 10 mb to be M . l\nmolecules HD created per molecule CH3D destroyed.\n\nIntroduction\nIn the stratosphere, HzO is created primarily by oxidation of\nCH4 and Hz by OH, Cl and O(1D). Likewise, oxidation of CH3D\nand HD creates HDO, but these deuterated species show a sufficiently different reactivity with surrounding chemical species s o\nthat, their measurement can provide additional insight into the\nstratospheric hydrogen budget. In understanding the deuterium\nbudget of the stratosphere and relating it to the hydrogen budget,\nseveral questions arise. First, what is the lifetime of CH3D compared to that of CH4, or put another way, how does the DM ratio\n\'California Institute of Technology, Pasadena CA 91 125.\n2Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena\nCA 91109.\n3NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton VA 23681.\n4Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138..\nSUniversity of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville AL 35899.\n6NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville AL 35812 .\n7SAIC - NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton VA 23681.\n8Institute of Astrophysics, University of Litge, 4000 LiBge-Cointe,\nBelgium.\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GLO 1402\n0094-8534196196GL-0 1402$05.00\n\na$/\'\n2\n\n\'?/\n\na\n\nin methane vary with the CHI mixing ratio? Second, is the rate of\nstratospheric HDO production balanced by that of CH3D oxidation? If not, could there be a net production or destruction of HD,\nand possibly a change in the DM ratio of molecular hydrogen, due\nto a difference in the rates between CH3D oxidation to HD and HD\noxidation to HDO? (Discussion of the WH ratio in stratospheric\nwater is in an accompanying paper by Moyer et al. [this issue].)\nWe address these questions using spectroscopic measurements\nof stratospheric CH3DandHD0 mixing ratios using data from the\nAWOS instrument. ATMOS, described in detail by Famret al.\n[1987], is a Fourier-transform infrared interferometer that\ngathered spectral absorption measurements at 0.01 cm- I\nresolution from solar occultations on board four Space Shuttle\nmissions (see Gunson et al. [this issue]). A previous report of\nHDO and CH3D results from ATMOS was made by Rinsland et al.\n[I9911 with data from the Spacelab 3 mission; however, their\nreport did not relate changes in the CH3D mixing ratio to those in\nHDO. With the combined Spacelab 3 and ATLAS-1, -2, and -3 missions, a much broader latitudinal coverage and many more vertical\nmixing ratio profiles were obtained, allowing characterization of\nthe CH3Dand HDO budget on a more global basis. An important\naddition to previous reports is measurement of CH3D inside the\nArctic and Antarctic vortices. Above 28 km, the molecular density of CH3D is normally too low to gain an adequate spectral\nabsorption signal with the ATMOS instrument. However, the\ndescent of upper stratospheric air to altitudes below 28 km inside\ne\n,\nthe vortices~[~bram.st h ~ .this issue a,b] allows measurement of\nCH3D in "old" air that would be otherwise impossible to measure.\nAs stratospheric dehydration is not the focus of this letter, we do\nnot report measurements of HDO inside the polar vortices.\nAnalyses are continuing on these vortex HDO measurements, and\nthey will be the focus of an upcoming paper.\nIn this paper, the delta notation is used to describe isotopic\nfractionation as the difference in parts per thousand of an\nisotopically labelled species with respect to a standard, e. g.,\n\nStandard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW) is used for the standard DM\nratio (see IUPAC [1983]) and we use the recommended value of\n(155.76fO.OS)xlO-6 [Hagernann et al., 19701.\n\nObservations and data analysis\nInformation about ATMOS on the shuttle missions, and\ndiscussion of the mixing ratio retrieval process, can be found in\nGumon et al.

However, CH4 can b e\nanalyzed in all of these filters and, with a correlation of CH3D t o\nCH4 in filter 3, we are able infer the mixing ratio of CH3D i n\nfilters 2 and 9 from C H 4 mixing ratios. At polar latitudes,\ndetermination as to whether a CH3D measurement was inside or\noutside the vortex was based on visual inspection of co-located\nmixing ratio profiles of CH4 and N 2 0 , as these gases show\nmarkedly smaller mixing ratios inside the vortex than outside at\nsimilar altitudes (see Abrams et al., this issue a,b). "Vortex edge"\nobservations were not used. CH3D results are presented from tangent pressures of 100 mb to 17 mb, and HDO results are from 1 0 0\nmb to 10 mb. Before final analyses, data were filtered by\nrejecting any observations with an estimated iandom error greater\nthan 30% for CH3D and HDO, or 10 % for CH4. This s t e p\neliminated about 16% of the filter 3 CH3D data and about 19% of\nthe filter 2 and 9 HDO data. Systematic biases, mostly from errors\nin line intensities, are estimated to be 7% for CH3D, 6% for HDO,\nand 5% for CH4 (see Abrams et al., this issue, c).\n\nCH3D measurement and the D/H ratio in methane\nRate constants for reactions of OH or C1 with CH3D are lower\nthan those for CH4 [DeMore et al., 1994; Wallington and Hurley,\n19921, but any isotope effect between the rate constants of the\nexcited O(1D) + CH3D and that of O(1D) CH4 is expected to be\nrelatively minor [Kaye, 19871. To estimate these combined\neffects on the D M ratio of methane, we begin by assuming that in\nthe mid to lower stratosphere CH4 and CH3D are only destroyed by\nOH, C1, and q 1 D ) oxidation, and photolysis is negligible. The\n\n+\n\noxidation of CH3D and CH4 can then be described by:\n\n1\n\nd[CHIDl\n-\n\n[CHID]\n\ndt\n\n-\n\n-K(T,z)\n\n1\n\ndtCH4I\n\n[CH,]\n\ndt\n\n--\n\n(7)\n\'\n\nwhere K(T,z) is the term inside the parentheses of (6). Note that\nthe left hand side of Equation (7) is the time constant for destruction of CH3D, or equivalently, its inverse lifetime. Thus, for a\nK(T,z) c 1, the lifetime of CH3D is longer than that of CH4. W e\nestimate an "average" K in the mid to lower stratosphere by assuming average fractions for destruction (i.e., fOH, fCI, and f\n0 (lD) ), and assuming that the ratios of the rate constants, y, are\nconstant with the temperature range in the mid to lower stratosphere and that mixing effects are minor. Integrating (6), assigning boundary conditions, and dividing by total molecular concentration to get mixing ratios (x) yield:\n\nor equivalently,\n\nwhere k(CH3D) and xo(CH4) are the initial mixing ratios of these\ngases as they enter the stratosphere. A rough estimate of I C ,can\n~\nbe made if we set yoH=0.67 (averaged from 190K to 250K using\nthe rate constants reported by DeMore et al. [1994]), ycl= 0.735\n(from the evaluation by Wallington a n d Hurley [1992] at 295K),\nand yoYo(tD)=l Kaye [1987]). Model calculations by one of us\n(see\n(RJS) indicate that between about 16 krn and 30 km, about 50% of\nthe destruction of CH4 is by OH, 29% by C1 and 21% by O(ID).\nSubstituting these laboratory data and model results, ~ ~ , = 0 . 7 8 ,\nsuggesting that the lifetime of CH3D is significantly longer than\nthat of CH4, and enrichment of deuterium in methane can occur a s\nthe CH4 mixing ratio decreases. We emphasize that this is only a\nrough estimation as none of the experiments measuring the kine-\n\nIRION E AL.: STRATOSPHERIC HDO AND CH3D FROM ATMOS\nT\n\n2383\n\nThis is lower than, but within error of the ATMOS Spacelab 3\nmeasurements of Rinsland et al.

We assume that xO(CH4)= (1.7 Irt0.03)x10-6 (from global 1992 tropospheric measurements reported in WMO [1995],\nand where we have assumed a 2% error). From a best fit line of\nIn x(CH3D) vs In x(CH4), we observe K,, = (0.84 0.02) ( l o\ncombined precision and systematic error), which is higher than\n,\n,\nour initial estimate of 0.78. Note that the error in K is not\naffected by systematic errors in the measured stratospheric mixing\nratios of CH3D and CH4 (which instead affect the error in the inter:\n;\ncept). Ch average, the stratospheric lifetime of CH3D should be K\n(=1.19+0.02) times that of CH4, or about 190 years based on a\nstratospheric CH4 lifetime of 160 years [Prather and Spivakovsky, 19901. From the fitted line at a tropospheric CH4\nmixing ratio of (1.7 1+0.03)~10-6,we find the mixing ratio of\nCH3D entering the stratosphere to be (9.9M.8)xlO-10 ( l o combined precision and systematic error).\nThe lower panel of Figure 1 shows the enrichment of CH3D\nwith CH4 mixing ratio, as well as the average enrichment calculated using the fitted line from the upper panel. Although there is\nconsiderable scatter in the data, it is seen that methane becomes\nprogressively enriched in deuterium as the mixing ratio of CH3D\ndecreases. With a tropospheric CH4 mixing ratio of (1.71\n0.03)xlO-6, the average 6D in methane entering the stratosphere\nis -(71*74)%0 ( l o combined precision and systematic error).\n\nIn the mid to lower stratosphere, atomic H is distributed\nprimarily among CH4, H 2 0 and H2, with negligible amounts\namong other species. It appears that oxidation of Hz is roughly\nbalanced by its production via oxidation of CH4 through a shortlived CH20 intermediate [Dessler et al, 1994; Abbas et al., this\nissue]. Similarly, deuterium is most likely distributed mainly\namong CH3D, HDO, and HD (with HD produced by oxidation of\nCH3D and destroyed by oxidation to HDO). However, in the mid\nto lower stratosphere, it may not necessarily be the case that the\n, , ratio\nmixing d of HD is as weakly varying as that of Hz. As suggested by EWlaltet al. [1989], the lower reaction rate constant of\nOH and HD compared to that of OH and H2 may serve to enrich\ntropospheric hydrogen gas in deuterium. However, stratospheric\ndestruction ofHD is regulated not only by rates of OH attack, but\nalso to a large extent by those of 0(1D), and the rate constant of\nthe O(1D) reaction is not expected to be significantly affected by\ndeuterium substitution [Kaye, 19871. (Reaction with C1 is a much\nmore minor sink for hydrogen than for methane using the rate\nconstants given by DeMore et al. [1994].) For production of HD,\naccount must be taken of not only the oxidation rates of CH3D,\nbut also the partitioning of D in the short-lived species in the\nreaction pathway from CH3D to HD (e.g. the yield of CH2D vs\nCH3, or that of CHDO vs CH20).

T h e\ncalculated slope, -(I .OM. 1) (lo combined precision and systematic error), indicates that HDO production is in near balance\nwith CH3D destruction. The error in the slope constrains the production of HD to be 3 3 . 1 molecules HD created for each CH3D\nmolecule destroyed; however, as only about 10% of stratospheric\ndeuterium is in HD, significant changes in the HD mixing ratio are\nstill possible within this error. Large effects may also occur in\nthe D H ratio of stratospheric molecular hydrogen, but this would\nalso be dependent on even minor changes in the H2 mixing ratio\nc h to Hz photolysis or CH4 oxidation (see, for example, Dessler\n~\net al. [1994]). The results in this report provide constraints for\nchanges in HD below about 10 mb.

Deuterium enrichment\nof water vapor in ascending parcels can occur only in\nconditions of rapid convection; enrichments persisting\ninto the stratosphere require that those conditions continue t o near-tropopause altitudes.

The ATMOS instrument, coverage, and data\nreduction procedure are described in detail elsewhere\n[Gunson et al., 1996, and references therein].\nWater vapor isotopic compositions are corrected for\nchanges occurring in the stratosphere by subtraction\nof methane-derived contributions of HDO and Hz0 at\neach data point; conservation of hydrogen and deuterium between water and methane in the stratosphere\nis demonstrated from these same data by Irion et al.\nand Abbas et al, [1996]. Initial concentrations of CH4\nand CH3D are taken as 1.7x10-~and 9.9~10-lo,respectively, from WMO [I9941 and the filter 3 ln[CH3D]:\nln[CH4] relationship [Irion et a!., 19961. CH3D concentrations are inferred from observed CH4 in filters 2\nand 9 using this relationship. This correction yields\nthe isotopic composition of water as it first crosses the\ntropopause, with no assumptions as to the initial concentration of that water.\nFigure 1 shows measurements of the isotopic composition of stratospheric water from all four ATMOS missions, before (la) and after (lb) correction for methane\ncontribution. After correction there is no trend in composition with altitude above 20 km. Slight deviations\nbelow 20 km are most likely due to the increased error\nin retrieval of water concentrations. The mean stratospheric water is highly depleted, with a SD, of -670\nzz 80 Ym, or 67% loss of deuterium (weighted mean of\n!\nall extravortex observations from 18-32 km; error represents 1 a of the distribution systematic error.)\nThere is no significant variation in\nwith mission,\nfilter, or latitude, over the 9 year span of these measurements, nor in comparison with previous measurements\ndating to 1980 [e.g. Pollock et al., 19801. Mesoscale or\nseasonal variability in SD, of entering stratospheric air\nshould be discernible only in the lower tropical stratosphere, where ATMOS HDO data is limited to only\nfour occultations (28 observations). The distribution of\nSD, values in these data is similar to that of the whole\ndataset, a Gaussian distribution with a peak at -680 Y\nm\nand a width of 90 Ym, with no outliers that might suggest contributions from isotopically distinct processes.\nAlthough isentropic mixing should erase much spatial\ninhomogeneity, this consistency suggests that stratospheric water enters with a characteristic isotopic signature similar to the mean stratospheric value.\n\n+\n\nm\n,\n\nImplications of stratospheric SD,\nFigure 1.

Solid/dashed lines\nrepresent immediate removal/total retention of liquid\ncondensate, and bracket the full range of 6D values\npossible in these scenarios. The strong enhancements\nat 10-12 km in high-S water-retaining cases occur because glaciation is allowed to proceed by evaporation of\ndroplets and recondensation as ice: at high S, a,,,,-ice\nis less than av,,o,-~,ui~ and deuterium is pumped into\nthe vapor. Complete vapor deposition of ice is not realistic and is an endmember case only.\n\nthese data of 3.6 ppm. (Model results are robust with\nrespect to this value; variations in water vapor of z t 20%\nproduce only minor isotopic changes). Isotopic fractionation occurs during the initial evaporation of seawater,\nthe condensation of liquid and ice, and the conversion\nof liquid t o ice as the cloud glaciates. Cloud liquid is\nallowed to re-equilibrate with cloud vapor, while ice is\neffectively removed from the vapor. Free parameters\nof the model are: surface temperature and relative humidity, temperatures of the onset of ice nucleation and\nthe completion of glaciation, the relative importance of\ndroplet freezing t o evaporation and re-deposition during glaciation, the degree of supersaturation over ice in\nthe final stages of ascent, and the precipitation (or lack\nthereof) in all condensing stages. Although simplified,\nthe model captures the full range of possible conditions\nfor a simple convective updraft.\nIn the first set of model runs isotopic partitioning\nwas assumed to occur at thermodynamic equilibrium in\nall stages, with the temperature dependence of a taken\nfrom Majoube [I9711 and Merlivat and Nzef 119671. In\nthese conditions, model-generated final isotopic compositions at the tropical tropopause in these conditions\nare all considerably lighter than observed stratospheric\nwater (Figure 2a). Stratospheric water vapor is highly\ndepleted of deuterium, but it is less depleted than would\nbe expected given the extent of dehydration experienced. While at lower altitudes, where liquid is present,\nvapor isotopic compositions can be substantially altered\n\n2387\n\nby choice of model parameters, all trajectories converge\nduring the nearly 7 km of ascent in ice-only conditions\nfrom the homogeneous freezing point of liquid water at\n% 233 K to the tropical tropopause at M 190 K. Dehydration in those last kilometers strips out virtually\nall deuterium: vapor concentration must drop by a factor of over a hundred, with strong fractionation at a\n= 1.3-1.4, so vapor D/H must drop by over 80% over\nthis altitude range alone. Even if no depletion occurred\nuntil the onset of ice condensation, the final SD under\nthese conditions would still be less than -800.\nThe deuterium content of stratospheric water can be\nincreased only if we postulate that (1) air parcels in this\n10-17 km region receive additional contributions from\nsources that are not in equilibrium with the vapor, or\n(2) isotopic fractionation is weaker than equilibrium values imply. For postulate (I), lofted cloud ice is the only\nplausible source of non-equilibrated water in the upper\ntroposphere or lower stratosphere. While liquid water\ncan rapidly exchange and equilibrate with its environment, the isotopic composition of ice remains essentially\nfixed [Jouzel and Merlivat, 19841. Ice particles carried\nupwards from their altitudes of condensation thus preserve anomalously heavy isotopic compositions in relation to their surrounding vapor, and, if later evaporated,\nserve t o enrich the vapor D/H ratio.\nThe second postulate, that isotopic fractionation has\nbeen reduced, is possible during ice deposition in highly\nsupersaturated air parcels, where kinetic effects prevent\nthe vapor and condensate from achieving their equilibrium isotopic partitioning [Jouzel and Mer!zvat, 19841.\nFigure 2b shows isotopic trajectories calculated using\nthis kinetic fractionation, for a range of supersaturations ( S ) . Because the condensing material extracts less\ndeuterium, the residual vapor remains heavier; at S of\n1.5 to 2 (150 - 200 %), depending on convective parameters, sufficient deuterium is left at the tropopause to\nmatch the observed stratospheric isotopic composition.\nEither of these scenarios is possible only in strong\nconvective systems. Supersaturations of 1.5 - 2 can\nbe sustained only by updraft velocities typical of the\nstrongest cumulus cores; in steady state, approximately\n20 - 50 m/s for the ice particle size distribution observed\nduring the STEP campaign in tropical near-tropopause\ncloud systems [Knollenberg et al., 1993; Rogers and\nYau, 1989; Pruppacher and Klett, 19801. Ice crystal\nevaporation, on the other hand, can significantly alter\nthe isotopic composition of vapor only if the ice crystals are substantially out of equilibrium with that vapor, i.e. if evaporation occurs at altitudes significantly\nhigher than the level of condensation, again a condition\npossible only in strong convective updrafts. (Temperature fluctuations of 5-8 degrees in stratospheric waves\ncan produce only minor enrichments.)\nDeuterium enrichment by either of these processes\nmust occur near the tropopause in order for some effect\nto persist into the stratosphere. Water vapor in a rising\nair parcel is depleted from its original composition to\nobserved stratospheric values in less than 3 km of ascent\nat upper tropospheric temperatures, so non-equilibrium\ndeuterium contributions must be occurring in the last\n\nMOYER E T AL.: ATMOS DEUTERATED WATER AND TROP-STRAT EXCHANGE\n\n3 km beneath the tropopause. Most water entering the\nstratosphere must experience convective conditions to\nat least the uppermost troposphere.\n\nConclusions\nATMOS deuterated water data constrain the process\nof STE to one of two scenarios. In the first, STE is\nclosely associated with deep convection. Actual crosstropopause transport may occur either as penetrative\nconvection which deposits air above the tropopause or\nas more gradual ascent in and above mesoscale convective systems; in the latter case the convective systems\ncontributing t o STE must reach altitudes of at least\n14 to 15 km (for a 17 km tropopause). In the second,\nSTE occurs over wider parts of the tropics, less directly\nassociated with convective systems, but here water in\nthe uppermost troposphere consists almost exclusively\nof enriched water from convective systems, most likely\nevaporated cloud ice. Again, this evaporation must occur at 14-15 km altitude or higher.\nFurther observations in the tropical lower stratosphere\nand upper troposphere are necessary for discriminating between these possibilities. Isotopic data from the\nstratosphere alone may be sufficient to demonstrate\nwhether the final dehydration of stratospheric air occurs in slow ascent rather than in convective penetration with admixture of evaporated ice, if a clear seasonal\ncycle in stratospheric SD, is detectable. Upper tropospheric data are necessary to determine spatial scales\nof transport. We conclude that a high priority should\nbe placed on obtaining further tropical measurements\nof HDO and H 2 0 at these altitudes, and that these observations should provide substantial additional insight\ninto mechanisms of troposphere-stratosphere transport.\nBrown for his\nWe thank\ncomments and suggestions on this manuscript, and David\n~ ~ i andh ~ i l R~~~~ for useful discussions.

We compare volume mixing ratio profiles of N20,\n0 3 , NO,, H20, CH4, and CO in the mid-latitude lower\nstratosphere measured by the ATMOS Fourier transform\nspectrometer on the ATLAS-3 Space Shuttle Mission with in\nsitu measurements acquired from the NASA ER-2 aircraft\nduring Nov 1994. ATMOS and ER-2 observations of [NzO]\nshow good agreement, as do measured correlations of [03],\n[NO,], [H20], and [CH4] with [N20]. Thus a consistent\nmeasure of the hydrogen (H20, CH4) content of the lower\nstratosphere is provided by the two platforms. The similarity\nof [NO,] determined by detection of individual species by\nATMOS and the total [NO,] measurement on the ER-2\nprovides strong corroboration for the accuracy of both\ntechniques. A 25% discrepancy in lower stratospheric [CO]\nobserved by ATMOS and the ER-2 remains unexplained.\nOtherwise, the agreement for measurements of long-lived\ntracers demonstrates the ability to combine ATMOS data with\nin situ observations for quantifying atmospheric transport.\nIntroduction\nA near coincidence between the deployment of ATMOS\n(Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy) on the ATLAS-3\n(ATmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science)\nmission of Nov 1994 (STS-66) and the final two flights of the\nNASA ER-2 aircraft during ASHOEIMAESA (Airborne\nSouthern Hemisphere Ozone Experiment / Measurements for\nAssessing the Effects of Stratospheric Aircraft) provides a\nvaluable opportunity for the intercomparison of observations\n\'Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology,\nPasadena, CA.\n2 ~ a ~ aUniversity, Cambridge, MA.\nrd\n3\n~NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA.\n~\n~\n~\n,\n4~nstitute Astrophysics, Univ. of Li&ge,LiBge-Cointe, Belgium.\nof\n\'NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA.\n6~~~~ A~nes\nResearch Center, Moffett Field, CA.\n7~~~~\nAeronomy Laboratory, Boulder, CO.\n\'cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences,\nUniversitv of Colorado.

The\nATMOS infrared Fourier transform spectrometer records highresolution solar occultation spectra to derive volume mixing\nratios (VMRs) of more than 30 gaseous constituents over a\nwide range of altitudes and latitudes [Gunson et al., 19961.\nThe suite of in situ instruments aboard the ER-2 also measure\nVMRs of numerous gases, for altitudes below -20 km and\ngeographic regions accessible to the aircraft. The ability to\ncombine space-based and in situ measurements of radical\nprecursors and tracers of atmospheric transport is important\nfor understanding processes controlling the composition of\nthe atmosphere. In this paper we compare VMRs of N20, Os,\nNO, (total nitrogen oxides: NO + NO2 + FINO3 + C10N02 +\n2N205 + HN04), H20, CH4, and CO.

The first sunset occultation (SSOI) occurred at\n49ON, 126"W, and subsequent sunsets were recorded at\nlatitudes progressively southward and westward, separated in\nlongitude by -23". Each ATMOS occultation consists of a\nprogression of atmospheric transmission spectra obtained at\ndifferent tangent heights. Vertical VMR profiles are retrieved\nby fitting absorption features of a target gas in one or several\nspectral intervals using an \'onion-peeling\' algorithm [Gunson\net a]., 19961. The retrieval process is iterated three times to\nminimize propagation of errors and a priori assumptions.\nDuring the spectral-fitting, the background transmission is\nitself a fitted parameter, so that ATMOS retrievals are largely\nunaffected by changes in background transmission due to\nbroadband absorption by aerosols. Retrieval of constituents\nis preceded by a combination of pressure and temperature\nsounding, using an assumed vertical profile of C 0 2 [Gunson\net a]., 19961. In the ATLAS-3 data, the tangent height spacing\nvaried from 1 to 4 km, with the smaller separations occurring\nat lower tangent heights and more tropical latitudes. The\nvertical resolution, set by the instrument field-of-view, is 3-4\nkm. ATMOS \'profiles are reported on a pressure grid of 12\npoints per decade.\nThe ER-2 aircraft was deployed over an eight month period\nin mid to late 1994 in support of the ASHOEIMAESA\ncampaign, designed to investigate the chemistry and\ntransport of a vast region of the lower stratosphere. Although\nmost flights of ASHOEIMAESA occurred in either the tropics\nor the southern hemisphere, the second-to-last flight on 2\nNov 1994 marked the return of the ER-2 from Hawaii to its\n\n23 90\n\nCHANG ET AL.: COMPARISON OF ATMOS AND ER-2: TRACERS OF TRANSPORT\n\nexhibited in Fig. 2 obscures any direct comparison, although\ndata for [N20] near the tropopause suggest a +2% bias of\nATMOS compared with the ER-2 measurements (throughout,\n% biases are computed as [ATMOS - ER-21 I ATMOS). Worth\nnoting is that ATMOS and ER-2 sample different spatial\nscales; while ATMOS effectively averages over an optical path\nseveral hundred kilometers long and a few kilometers in\ndiameter, the ER-2, traveling at -200 mls, integrates over\nrelatively short distances along the flight path only.\nThe ACATS-IV (Airborne Chromatograph for Atmospheric\nMeasurement Comparison\nTrace Species) gas chromatograph on the ER-2 reports [N20]\nMeasurements of long-lived constituents are better every 6 minutes with a l o precision of 0.9% and an accuracy\ncompared by examining correlations with gases, rather than of 2% [Elkins et a]., 19961, and is calibrated by running a\nvertical profiles, to account for variations in dynamical sample of air at mixing ratios near stratospheric levels once\nhistory of differing air masses [Loewenstein et al., 19891.

ATMOS data presented\nhere were retrieved without accounting for the variation of the\nconcentration of NO and NO2 across the day-night terminator,\nwhich could result in errors in [NOy] of <0.2 ppbv in the lower\nstratosphere [Newchurch et al., 19961.\nThe NOAA NO-NOy chemiluminescence detector obtains\n[NOy] measurements on the ER-2 at a frequency of 1 Hz with a\nl o total uncertainty of better than 10% [Fahey et al., 19891.

The consistency of [NOy] determined\nby observation of each individual species by ATMOS with\nvalues of total [NOy] measured by chemiluminescence\nfollowing chemical conversion of each NOy component to NO\nprovides strong corroboration for the accuracy of both\nmethods. ATMOS measurements extend the [NOy] and [N20]\nrelation to high altitude, and show the decrease in [NOy]\nabove 40 km due to the reaction N+NO.\nFigure 3c shows observations of [H20] vs [ N 2 0 ] ATMOS\nretrieves [H20] in Filters 3, 4, and 9 with a l o systematic\nuncertainty of 6% and estimated precisions of better than 5%\nat altitudes above 200 mbar.

ATMOS Version 2 retrievals of [H20]\noccasionally suffer instabilities due to the sudden change in\nthe slope of the profile at the hygropause, as particularly\nevident by one occultation in the coincidence group.\nOtherwise, the agreement between the ATMOS and NOAA\nmeasurements of [H20] is good; differences in mean range\nfrom -8% (-0.4 ppmv of [H20]) at [N20] = 170 ppbv to +6%\n(+0.2 ppmv of [HzO]) at [NzO] = 260 ppbv.

ACATS-IV measures [CH4] on\nthe ER-2 at a sampling interval of 3 min with a l o precision of\n1.5% and an accuracy of 2% [Elkins et al., 19961. Agreement\nin mean between the ATMOS and ACATS-IV measurements of\n[CH4] is better than B% (kO.05 ppmv of [CH4] at [N20] = 300\nppbv) for all values of [N20]. Further analysis of ATMOS data\nshows variations of the [CH4] vs [N20] correlation depending\non geographic region due to differences in the latitudinal\ndependence of the photochemical sinks, suggesting this\ncorrelation can be used as an indicator of mixing between air\nof tropical and mid-latitude origin.\nFigure 3e shows correlations of [CO] vs [N20]. ATMOS\nobserves [CO] in Filters 3 and 9 with a l o systematic\nuncertainty of 5% and estimated precisions of better than 10%\nbelow altitudes of 20 mbar, improving to 5% at 100 mbar.\nThe ALIAS (Aircraft Laser Infrared Absorption Spectrometer)\ndiode laser instrument [Webster et al., 19941 provides [CO]\nmeasurements on the ER-2 at an interval of 3.5 s with a l o\nprecision of 10% and an accuracy of 5%. The observations of\n\n[CO] by ALIAS are 23% lower (3 ppbv of [CO]) than those of\nATMOS at [N20] < 220 ppbv and 41% lower (7 ppbv of [CO])\nat [N20] = 270 ppbv, a difference larger than expected based\non the respective uncertainties. Measurements of [CO] by\nALIAS in Nov 1995 reveal minimum [CO] in the stratosphere\nof 12-13 ppbv, comparable to the ATMOS observations of 12\nppbv obtained in Nov 1994. The cause of the discrepancy in\n[COl\n- - in Nov 1994 between ATMOS and ALIAS is unclear.\nIn this paper we have shown good agreement among\nmeasurements of [N20], [03], [NOy], [H20], and [CH4]\nobtained by ATMOS and instruments aboard the ER-2. The\ncomparisons presented here demonstrate that high resolution\nin situ measurements of tracers can be combined with spacebased measurements to study atmospheric transport over\nbroad geographic regions and altitudes. This synergism\nenhances our ability to quantify the dynamical and chemical\nprocesses that regulate the abundance of stratospheric ozone.\nAcknowledgments.

We compare volume mixing ratio profiles of N 2 0 ,\nCFC-I 1, CFC-12, CC14, SF6, and HCl in the mid-latitude lower\nstratosphere measured by the ATMOS Fourier transform\nspectrometer on the ATLAS-3 Space Shuttle Mission with in\nsitu measurements acquired from the NASA ER-2 aircraft\nduring Nov 1994. Good agreement is found between ATMOS\nand in situ correlations of [CFC-I I], [CFC-121, and [SF6] with\n[N20]. ATMOS measurements of [CC14] are 15% high\ncompared to ER-2 data, but agree within the systematic\nuncertainties. ATMOS observations of [HCl] vs [N20] are\nwithin -10% of ER-2 data for [HCI] > 1 ppbv, but exceed in\nsitu measurements by larger fractional amounts for smaller\n[HCI]. ATMOS measurements of [ClONO2] agree well with\nvalues inferred from in situ observations of [CIO], [NO], and\n[03]. The sum of [HCI] and [ClONO2] observed by ATMOS,\nsupplemented by a minor contribution from [CIO] estimated\nwith a photochemical model, is consistent with the levels of\ninorganic chlorine inferred from in situ measurements of\nchlorine source gases.\nIntroduction\n\nThe ATMOS (Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy)\nFourier transform spectrometer uses solar occultation\nmeasurements to derive volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles\nof more than 30 constituents in Earth\'s atmosphere.

Chang et al. [I9961\ndiscuss more fully the geographic coincidence of the\nobservations, compare vertical profiles of [N20], and\ndemonstrate good agreement for correlations of long-lived\ntracers [03], [NOy], [H20], and [CH4] with [N20] observed from\nthe two platforms (throughout, [I denotes VMR). This paper\npresents correlations of [CFC-111, [CFC-121, [CC14], [SF6],\n[ClONO2], [HCl], and [Cly] (total inorganic chlorine) with\n[N20] measured or inferred from ATMOS and the ER-2, and\ncompares measurements of inorganic chlorine species with\nresults of photochemical model simulations.\nAll comparisons in this study are presented as correlations\nwith the long-lived tracer N 2 0 to account for the dynarnical\nhistories of different air masses. For the ER-2 flight segments\nconsidered here, [N20] measured by ATLAS (Airborne Tunable\nLaser Absorption Spectrometer) [Loewenstein et al., 19891 are\nwithin 1% of those observed by ACATS-IV (Airborne\nChromatograph for Atmospheric Trace Species) [Elkins et al.,\n19961. Because of the higher sampling rate, the ATLAS data\nfor [NzOl are used for ER-2 correlations shown here. Version\n2 ATMOS data are used throughout [Gunson et al., 19961.\nHalogen Source Gases\n\nATMOS measures VMRs of CFC-11 (CC13F), CFC-12\n(CC12F2), HCFC-22 (CHC1F2), CH3Cl, and CC14, which\ntogether constitute -80% of total tropospheric organic\nchlorine [Zander et al., 19961. The ACATS-IV gas\nchromatograph on the ER-2 measures CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC113 (CCI2F-CCIF2), CH3CC13, CC14, and Halon-121 1\n(CBrClF2), which likewise comprise -80% of tropospheric\nchlorine. Halogenated gases are measured by ACATS-IV with\nprecisions and accuracies of better than 1% and 2%\nrespectively, at intervals of 3 min, except SF6, which is\nmeasured every 6 min. ACATS-IV is calibrated on the ground\nagainst the same standards used in the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration 1 Climate Monitoring and\nDiagnostic Laboratory network of tropospheric measuring\nstations [Elkins et a]., 19931, and is calibrated in flight by\nrunning a sample of air with mixing ratios near stratospheric\nlevels every 4 ambient samples, or 15 to 30 min.\nOptical bandpass filters, used to improve the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) of measured spectra, determine the set of\n\n2393\n\nCHANGET AL.:COMPARISONOF ATMOS AND ER-2: HALOGENATED GASES\nwavenumbers, such as CFC- 11, CFC- 12, CC14, C10N02, and\nSF6.

JPL94\n[DeMore et al.] and Model C [Michelsen et al.] assume yields\n.\nof 0% and 7%, respectively, for HC1 from ClO+OH.\n\nCHANG ET AL.: COMPARISON OF ATMOS AND ER-2: HALOGENATEDGASES\nensemble of spectral windows (e.g., 03,\nN20, CH4, H20, NO,\nNO2) are unaffected by these difficulties.\nFigure l a illustrates the agreement of ATMOS and ER-2\nmeasurements of [CFC-I I] with [N20]. The horizontal axis\ncorresponds to altitudes from the upper troposphere to -30\nkm. ATMOS measures [CFC-I I] with estimated l o precisions\n(random errors) of better than 5% and an accuracy (systematic\nuncertainty) of 11%, and detects [N20] with l o precisions and\naccuracies of 5% each. ATMOS makes a priori estimates of\nprecision during each VMR retrieval from considerations\nsuch as residual errors in the fitting of spectra; systematic\nuncertainties are determined by combining uncertainties in\nthe spectroscopic band intensities [Brown et al., 19961 with\nthose related to the tangent pressure assignment. More\ndetails on ATMOS accuracies and precisions are presented in\nAbrams et al. [1996]. The mean difference in [CFC-111\nmeasured by ATMOS and the ER-2 is +4% (+I1 pptv of [CFC111 at [N20] = 300 ppbv), well within the uncertainties of the\nmeasurements, with no apparent dependence on [NzO]\n(throughout, % biases are computed as [ATMOS - ER-21 I\nATMOS). Correlations of [CFC-121 with [N20] are shown in\nFig. Ib. ATMOS measures [CFC-121 with a l o accuracy of 9%\nand estimated precisions of better than 5%. In mean, good\nagreement is obtained in [CFC-121 between the ATMOS and\nER-2, with differences ranging from +5% (+I3 pptv of [CFC121) at [N20] = 170 ppbv to -6% (-26 pptv of [CFC-121) at\n[N20] = 280 ppbv.\nFigure l c compares observations of [CC14] vs [N20].\nATMOS measures [CC14] with a l o accuracy of 20% and\nestimated precisions of better than 10%. The ATMOS values\nof [CC14] are 15% higher (20 pptv of [CCl,] at P 2 0 ] = 300\nppbv) compared to the in situ data. ATMOS retrieves [CC14]\nusing the v3, v1+v4 bandhead at 796 cm-\', with temperaturedependent absorption cross-sections and band intensities\nfrom Orlando et al. [1992]. The deviation of the ATMOS\nmeasurements is consistent with the estimated uncertainty in\nthe bandstrength, whose value varies considerably in the\nliterature [Brown et al., 19961. Figure Id shows comparisons\nof [SF6] with [N20]. ATMOS measures [SF6], a good indicator\nof the age of stratospheric air owing to its long photochemical lifetime and known tropospheric growth rate, with a\naccuracy of 11% and estimated l o precisions of -10%. The\nATMOS data are on average 5% higher (0.16 pptv of [SF6] at\n[N20] = 300 ppbv) than the in situ observations, demonstrating quite good agreement over a wide range of [N20].\n\nInorganic Chlorine\nThe coincidence between ATMOS and ER-2 measurements\nin Nov 1994 provides a test of our understanding of the\npartitioning of inorganic chlorine at mid-latitudes. ATMOS\nmeasures [HCl] and [ClONO2], which are the dominant forms\nof Cly in the lower stratosphere for air unaffected by polar\nstratospheric clouds. ATMOS observes [HCl] and [ClONO2]\nusing different optical filters and thus never in the same\noccultation; however, species such as O3 and N20 measured in\nmultiple filters provide a framework for combining nearby\nobservations. Instruments aboard the ER-2 observe [HCl] and\n[ClO], the latter being the reactive form of Cly that photochemically removes ozone. Although in situ measurements of\n[C10N02] have never been obtained, its concentration can be\ninferred from data of [ClO] and [NO2], or [ClO], [03], and [NO].\nMeasured correlations of [HCl] vs [N20] are shown in Fig.\n\n2395\n\n2a. ATMOS observes [HCI] in Filter 3 with a l o accuracy of\n5% and estimated precisions of better than 5% at altitudes\nabove 50 mbar, degrading to 15% at 150 mbar. The ALIAS\n(Aircraft Laser Infrared Absorption Spectrometer) diode laser\ninstrument provides in situ observations of [HCl] using\ntransitions in the same spectral band used by ATMOS\n[Webster et al., 19941. For the Nov 1994 flights, ALIAS\nreports [HCl] at 6 minute intervals with a l o precision of 0.07\nppbv (e.g., 5% at 1.5 ppbv, 20% at 0.35 ppbv) and an accuracy\nof 5%. For [HCl] > 1 ppbv, the ER-2 observations are 13%\nlower (0.2 ppbv of [HCl]) than the ATMOS data, but the\nmeasurements agree within their combined uncertainties. For\n[HCl] < 1 ppbv, the ER-2 mixing ratios are lower by 40% (0.4\nppbv of [HCl]), although the upper range of variability of the\nALIAS data overlaps the ATMOS data. ALIAS observations of\n[HCl] at a given [N20] during Nov 1994 were -60% higher\nthan seen by ALIAS in May 1993, when northern hemisphere\nmid-latitude [HCl]/[Cly] ratios were observed to be -0.4,\ncompared to model calculations of -0.7 [Webster et al., 19941.\nThis evolution of [HC1]/[Cly] sampled by the ER-2 appears\ncorrelated with decreasing sulfate aerosol loading [Webster et\nal., in preparation].\nThe correlations of [ClONO2] vs p 2 0 ] measured by\nATMOS and inferred from ER-2 measurements are shown in\nFig. 2b. ATMOS detects [ClONO2] with a accuracy of 20% and\nestimated l o precisions of 10-20%. The peak mixing ratio of\nC10N02 equals 0.9 ppbv and occurs at -26 km altitude ([N20]\n= 120 ppbv), leading to a maximum of -0.5 for the\n[C1ONO2]/[HCl] ratio. As measurements of [NO2] on the ER-2\nare unavailable for the flights under consideration, [ClONO2]\nis inferred from noon-time measurements of [ClO], [NO], and\n[03], using the steady-state expressions [Kawa et al., 19921,\n[CIONO?] * (noon) =\n[NO2]* = [NO]\n\n~CIO+NO*+M\n[ClOl[NO2l[Ml\n3\n\n1\n\nk ~ O + O ,[O3 + k~O+~lOIC1O]\n\n,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nNO,\n\nwhere * denotes an inferred quantity and here [I refers to\nconcentration. Photolysis rates for C10N02 and NO2 are\ncomputed using a radiative transfer model constrained by\nplanetary reflectivity from the Total Ozone Mapping\nSpectrometer (TOMS) and vertical profiles of O3 derived by\ncombining in situ observations with total column\nmeasurements from TOMS [Salawitch et al., 19941. ATMOS\nmeasurements are obtained at sunset, where models indicate\n[C10N02] should fall midway between values at noon and\nnight. Figure 2b shows [ClONO2]* (sunset) inferred for the\nER-2, calculated fiom in situ measurements of [ClO], P O ] ,\nand [03] obtained within fl hr of local noon using Eqns. (I),\n(2), and [CION02]* (sunset) = [C10N02]* (noon) + 0.5 [ClO]\n(noon). The l o uncertainty in [ClONO2]* estimated from the\npropagation of errors in the kinetic parameters and observed\nquantities is +90% [Kawa et al., 19921. For [N20] < 250 ppbv,\nthe ATMOS measurements of [ClONO2] and values inferred\nfrom the in situ data agree on average within f 10% (f0.04\nppbv of [ClONO2]). Systematic discrepancies of +45% (+0.06\nppbv of [ClONO2]) are exhibited at higher values of [N20],\nwhere the fractional uncertainties in [ClONO2] measured by\nATMOS become large due to its decreasing abundance.\nFigure 2c compares [Cly] vs [N20] from ATMOS and ER-2\ndata. The ATMOS values of [Cly] were constructed by\nsumming the measured [HCl] and [C10N02], averaged on a 10\n\nppbv wide grid of [N20], with [ClO] calculated for sunset\nusing the assumptions for \'Model C\' described below. The\nER-2 values of [Cl,] were determined by averaging on the\nsame [NzO] grid measurements of [HCl], [ClONO2]* (noon),\nand [ClO] collected within +2 hr of local noon. The\ncontribution of [ClO] to [Cl,] is less than 5% for all cases\nconsidered here. Observations [Zander et al., 19961 and\nsimulations indicate that other gases, such as\nHOCl, contribute negligibly to [Cl,] at these altitudes.\nFigure 2c includes another estimate of inorganic chlorine,\ndenoted here as [ ~ l , ] ? , determined by subtracting total\norganic chlorine, measured by ACATS and the Whole Air\nSampler during the 1992 ER-2 campaign, from the total\norganic chlorine loading in the troposphere [Woodbridge et\nal., 19951. The [~l,,]? relation shown here has been increased\nby 6.7% relative to the published relation of Woodbridge et\nal. to account for changes in stratospheric chlorine between\n1992 and Nov 1994 [Zander et al., 19961. ATMOS [Cl,] are on\naverage 0.25 ppbv lower than levels predicted from in situ\nmeasurements of organic source gases for [N20] > 180 ppbv,\nwith better agreement at lower [N20]. Inferred [Cl,] from the\nER-2 are on average 0.58 ppbv lower than [~l,]?. The smaller\nabundance of [Cl,] from the in situ measurements of\ninorganic chlorine compared to [Cl,] from ATMOS is due to\nlower values of [HCl] that are not balanced by higher\n[C1ONO2]*. Trajectory calculations indicate that air parcels\nalong these ER-2 flights have recently undergone large\nexcursions in temperature (-15 K) and latitude (-15") [P.\nNewman, private communication, 19961. However, our model\nsimulations show the partitioning of [HCl] and [ClONO2] is\ninsensitive to the changes in temperature and latitude along\nthese trajectories, provided precursor (i.e., Cl,, NO,, H20, 0 3 )\nlevels remain unchanged. It is unlikely that the air sampled\nby ATMOS and the ER-2 could have large differences in [Cl,,]\nfor the same [N20], given the similarity of source gases\ndisplayed in Fig. 1. The cause of the discrepancy between\nATMOS and ER-2 measurements of [HCl] remains unclear.\nPhotochemical simulations [Salawitch et al., 1994;\nMichelsen et al., 19961 are used to test our understanding of\npartitioning of inorganic chlorine gases. The model is\nconstrained to match calculated [HC1]+[ClONO2] to the sum\nmeasured by ATMOS. Two sets of kinetic parameters are\nconsidered: the first uses reaction rate constants and\nphotolytic cross sections from the JPL 1994 compilation\n[DeMore et al., 19941 and a 0% yield of HCI from the reaction\nC1O+OH; the second (\'Model C\' of Michelsen et al. [1996])\nincorporates several changes of which the most significant\nwith respect to partitioning of [ClONO2] and [HCl] is an\nassumed 7% yield of HC1 from the reaction ClO+OH. The\nsensitivity of model results to each kinetic parameter is\ndiscussed in Michelsen et al. [1996].\nModel results for [HCl] and [C10N02] at local sunset are\ncompared with ATMOS observations in Figs. 2a and 2b. For\n[NzO] > 200 ppbv, both models predict similar levels of [HCl]\nand are consistent with the partitioning of [C1ONO2] and\n[HCl] observed by ATMOS. At lower levels of [N20], the\nmodel allowing for production of HCl from ClO+OH results in\nbetter agreement with the ATMOS data. Figure 2d shows a\ncomparison of [ClO] calculated subject to constraints\nimposed by the ATMOS data, but corresponding to midafternoon solar conditions sampled by the ER-2, where in situ\nmeasurements of [ClO] are obtained with a 10 accuracy of 15%\n[Stimpfle et al., 19941. Although both models overestimate\n[ClO] for [N20] < 240 ppbv, data for [ClO] agree more closely\nwith the model allowing for production of HCl from ClO+OH.\nThe decade-long record of ATMOS observations of organic\n\nand inorganic chlorine allows quantification of distributions\nand trends for gases that are precursors of ozone destroying\nradicals and significant contributors to greenhouse warming\n[Zander et al., 19961. ATMOS measurements provide a selfconsistent picture of the organic and inorganic chlorine\nbudgets and, together with in situ data, provide valuable\nconstraints on our understanding of chlorine chemistry and\nthe effects of anthropogenic chlorine compounds on ozone.\nAcknowledgments.

Simultaneous stratospheric volume mixing ratios\n(VMRs) measured inside and outside the Antarctic vortex by the\nAtmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) instrument\nin November 1994 reveal previously unobserved features in the\ndistributions of total reactive nitrogen (NOy) and total hydrogen\n(H20+2CH4). Maximum removal of NOy due to sedimentation\nof polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) inside the vortex occurred at\na potential temperature (0) of 500-525 K (-20 km), where values\nwere 5 times smaller than measurements outside. Maximum loss\nof H20+2CH4 due to PSCs occurred in the vortex at 425-450 K,\n-3 km lower than the peak NOy loss. At that level, %0+2CH4\nVMRs inside the vortex were -70% of corresponding values outside. The Antarctic and April 1993 Arctic measurements by\nATMOS show no significant differences in H20+2CH4 VMRs\noutside the vortices in the two hemispheres. Elevated NOy VMRs\nwere measured inside the vortex near 700 K. Recent model\ncalculations indicate that this feature results from downward\ntransport of elevated NO,J produced in the thermosphere and\nmesosphere.\n\nIntroduction\nCold temperatures inside the Antarctic vortex during austral\nwinter promote the condensation of polar stratospheric cloud\n(PSC) particles that provide surfaces for the heterogeneous\nactivation of reactive chlorine and bromine, leading to catalytic\nO3 destruction in sunlit regions [cf. World Meteorological\nOrganization (WMO), 19901. Wide-spread, permanent removal\nof NO (denitrification) and H20 (dehydration) by sedimentation\nS\nof P S ~ is a regular feature of the Antarctic vortex. These losses\nmay lead to lower NOy and H20 mixing ratios over broad regions\nof the mid-latitude southern hemisphere [Kelly et al., 1990;\n\n\'Atmospheric Sciences Division, NASA Langley Research Center,\nHampton, Virginia\n2Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology,\nPasadena, California\n3Universityof Alabama, Huntsville\n4~nstitute Astrophysics, University of LiBge, 4000 LiBge-Cointe,\nof\nBe1 ium\n\'Space Science Laboratory, NASA Marshall Space l g h t Center,\nHuntsville, Alabama\n\'systems and Applied Sciences Corporation, Hampton, Virginia\n7Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\'~epartmentof Physics, University of Denver, Denver, Colorado\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GL00048\n\n0094-8534196196GL-00048$05.00\n\nI\n\nc:,b/ 7 7 q\np\nJ\nI\n\nPierce et al., 1994; Tuck et al., 1994; Nevison et al., 19961.\nOzone losses following PSC formation also occur in the Arctic\nvortex but less often and on smaller spatial scales [e.g., Fahey et\nal., 1990al. The possibility that PSC formation temperatures may\nrise as a result of H 2 0 or HN03 increases [Newman et al., 19931\nunderscores the importance of understanding these processes.\nWe report here an analysis of simultaneous volume mixing\nratios (VMRs) of total reactive nitrogen, NOy, and YO+2CH4\n(total hydrogen less H2), as a function of potential temperature\n(0)and [N20] (where [x] denotes the VMR of species x) derived\nfrom Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS)\n0.01-cm-\' resolution IR solar occultation spectra recorded near or\nover Antarctica during the ATLAS-3 shuttle mission of 3-12\nNovember 1994. The ATMOS measurements cover a wide O\nrange inside and outside the vortex and reveal previously\nunobserved features in the distributions of [NOy] and\n[~01+2[cHJ.\nMinimum Antarctic stratospheric temperatures of -200 K\nimply that PSCs had evaporated prior to the mission. However,\nthe vortex remained intact in the lower stratosphere with very low\n0 3 levels [Manney et al., 19961.\n\nMeasurements\nThe ATMOS measurements analyzed here were recorded with\nfilter 3 (1580-3420 cm-l) or 9 (650-2450 cm-l) during sunrises at\n64.53 to 72.43 latitude. Simultaneous H20, CH4, and %O profiles were derived from measurements with both filters. All the\ngases used to define NOy, calculated from [NOy]= [NO] + [N%]\n+ [HN03] + 2[N205] + [HqN02] + [CLON02] were measured\nonly with filter 9.\nVersion 2 profiles are presented here with no diurnal\ncorrections applied in the NO and NO2 retrievals [Abrams et al.,\n1996al. Photochemical model studies show differences of <0.2\nppbv\nby volume) between [NO]+[N02] obtained with and\nwithout diurnal correction factors for a wide range of conditions\nin the lower stratosphere [Newchurch et al., 19961, producing a\nnegligible error in [NO ] Additionally, [NOy] was calculated\ny :\nassuming a 3-km scale helght decreases in [N20,], [Cd3N02],\n[H02N02], [NO2], and [HN03] above and below the altitude\nrange of the measurements. Our NOy values are not sensitive to\nthis assumption because the extrapolated VMRs are small relative\nto those of the measured species.\nThe estimate uncertainty in [NOy] determined by combining\nthe systematic uncertainties of the individual constitutents is\n+15%. ATMOS and correlative ER-2 measurements of NOy,\nH20, and CH4 show excellent agreement. Hence, the true systematic error in the ATMOS measurements may be less than the\nestimated values [Chang et al., 19961.\n\n4\n\nRTNSLAND ET AL.: ATMOS MEASUREMENTS OF H20+2C& AND TOTAL REACTIVE\nvvumw\n\n0\n\n45\n\nvvvwvv\n\nw\n\n135\n\n90\n\nv v v w v wvm w w v v v v V\n\n180\n\n225\n\n270\n\nrn\n\n3600,\n\n310\n\nH,0+2CH,\n9000.\n\n7650.\n\nV V V\n\n-\n\nI=\n\n2\nf\n2\n\n.\'\n\n500\n350\n\n-\n\n0\n\n-14.\n\n45\n\n-10.\n\n90\n\n135\n180\nLongitude\n\n-5.\n\n(O\n\n360\n\n(ppbv)\n\n225\nE)\n\n270\n\nw\n5.\n\n315\n\ne\n\n360\n\nNOY-NOY* ( P P ~ V )\n\n8.\n\nFigure 1 Distributions of [HI (top), [H20] (middle), and [ANl (bottom) versus O and longitude ("E).

[NOy*], the NOY VMR\nexpected in the absence of denitrification, was derived from a fit\nto [NOy] versus [N20] measured outside the vortex. Longitude is\na useful coordinate since the measurements were obtained over a\nnarrow latitude range and the vortex was at similar longitudes\nthroughout the mission [Manneyet d.,\n19961. Contours of [N20]\n(overlayed) show the clear signature of deep descent between\nlongitudes of -23O0E to 30"E.\nAbove -550 K, measurements of [HI (top) are characterized\nby values between 7.0 and 7.5 ppmv (lo6 by volume), a small\nincrease with 0, and no obvious longitude dependence despite\ndifferences of two orders of magnitude between [N20] inside and\noutside the vortex near 700 K. Below 550 K, [HI decreases\nsharply to a minimum of 4 ppmv in the vortex interior. Minimum\n[HI and the corresponding O agree with measurements by the\nHalogen Occultation Experiment during September and October\n1992 [Pierce et al., 19941.\nThe distribution of [H20] (middle) is -1.5 ppmv higher inside\nthe vortex than outside between 550 and 900 K, due to downward\ntransport of moist air from the upper stratosphere and lower\nmesosphere. Similar [H20] observations in the November 1991\nsouthern vortex were reported by Harwood et al. [1993].\n\nMinimum [H20] of -2 ppmv in the vortex is also consistent with\nprevious measurements [Kelly et al., 1990; Pierce et al., 1994;\nSantee et al., 19951.\nThe ATMOS [AN] measurements (bottom) reveal massive\ndenitrification within the vortex between.400 and 600 K. The\nsignature of denitrification extends to extra-vortex air near 180\xc2\xb0E\nfor 0<400 K. However, the vast majority of extra-vortex air\nshows no significant denitrification. Enhanced [NOy] exists in\nthe vortex between 700 and 900 K, for air characterized by\nexceedingly low [N20].\nValues of scaled potential vorticity (sPV) in 10"\' s-\' [Manney\net al., 19961 were used to classify each measurement as inside the\nvortex (sPV>2), outside (sPV<l), or as intermediate "edge" air\n(l<sPV<2). [N20] is well correlated with sPV values above\n-400 K; below this level, [N20] is relatively well-mixed with\nrespect to longitude, while sPV gradients for the same locations\nand times suggest that the vortex extended down at least to 375 K\n[Abrams et al., 1996b; Manney et al., 19961.\nFigure 2 shows [HI versus the log of m20] for measurements\nbetween 320 and 2050 K. The solid line, a linear fit to the outof-vortex measurements (filled circles), defines [H*]\nversus\n[N20], the out-of-vortex reference relation. [H*] decrease from\n7.70ppmv at [N20] of 2 ppbv to 7.00 ppmv at [%Ol of\n300 ppbv; increases at low [N20] are presumably due to the oxidation of Hz. Values of [HI inside the vortex (open circles) lie\nbelow the reference relation, especially for [N20] between 20 and\n\nRINSLAND ET AL.: ATMOS MEASUREMENTS OF H20+2CH4AND TOTAL REACTIVE\nATLAS 3 SUNRISES, FILTER 3 AN0 9, unlt=ppvb(s-09)\n\nATLAS 3 SUNRISES, FILTER 9, UNIT=PPBV(E-09)\n\n10000\n\nI\n\n1. < = S P Y <\n\n4000[\n\n1.5\n\n(H20+2CH4)* ATLAS 3\n\n--\n\n(H20+2CH4)r\n\nATUS 2\n\n, , , , ,,,\n10\n\n2000\n1\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, , ,\n\n;,\nO, 0\n\n100\n\nN20 (VMR)\n\n,-\n\n,\n\n,I\n\nFigure 2.

This difference defines the level of dehydration in the\nvortex since similar relations would be expected in both regions\ndue to the long lifetimes of the gases.\nThe dashed line in Fig. 2 shows a fit to ATMOSIATLAS 2\nArctic extra-vortex (sPV>2) [H*] measurements from filters 2\n(1 100-2000 cm-\') and 3. The observations were recorded\n8-17 April 1993. Antarctic extra-vortical [H*] averages\n0.2-0.3 ppmv higher than values in the Arctic for the same [N20].\nIn contrast, -1 ppmv lower [H20] was measured outside the vortex in the Antarctic than in the Arctic from the ER-2 aircraft\n[Kelly et al., 1990; Fahey et al., 1990al. The cause of this difference is not clear.\nIn Fig. 3, simultaneous ATMOS measurements of [NO ] and\n[N20] in the Antarctic are shown. The filled circles ( s h < l )\ndefine a compact out-of-vortex relation over the full measurement\nrange. A least-squares fit to these measurements (solid curve)\ndefines [NOy*] vs. [N20]. The substantial change in the slope of\nthe reference curve at low [N20] reflects the upper atmospheric\nsink of NOy due to the NO + N loss reaction [Fahey et al.,\n1990bl. The dashed curve shows the average out-of-vortex relation derived equatorward of the vortex boundary from 1987\nAntarctic and 1989 Arctic ER-2 measurements [Fahey et al.,\n1990al. Evidence for a nonlinear correlation between [NOy] and\n[N,O], not due to denitrification, was reported during AASE I1\n[Gewenstein et al., 19931, consistent with other NOy measurements at low [N20] [e.g., Fahey et al., 1990bl.\nMeasurements of [NOy] inside the vortex (open circles, plus\nsymbols) in Fig. 3 diverge from the reference relation at\n[N2.0]=270 ppbv. These differences define the extent of denitrificatlon due to sedimentation of PSCs. The minimum\n[NOy]/[NO *] ratio of 0.2 occurred at [N20]=100 ppbv. The\nmirumum\nof -3 ppbv measured by ATMOS inside the\nvortex agrees with the lowest levels of -2k1 ppbv measured in\nthe Antarctic vortex during August 1987 [Fahey et al., 19891.\nBased on the ATLAS 3 measurements and the corresponding\nout-of-vortex reference curves in Figs. 2 and 3, [AH], defined as\n\nNO^]\n\n2399\n\n1\n\nI\n\n10\n\nI\n\n100\n\nN,O (VMR)\n\nFigure 3.

The dashed curve shows the\nlinear [NOy*]-[N20] relation derived from Arctic and Antarctic\nER-2 aircraft measurements [Fahey et al., 1990al.\n\n[HI-[H*], and [AN] have been calculated as a function of O.\nValues for measurements with sPV>2 (vortex interior air) are\ngiven in Table 1. The minimum [AH] is reached at 425-450 K,\n-17 km altitude, whereas the minimum [AN] occurred at\n500-525 K, -20 km altitude.\nThe results in Table 1 indicate that the maximum NOy removal\noccurred at a higher altitude than that of H20+2CH4. These\nresults are consistent with Antarctic aircraft measurements which\nobserved type I PSCs above the altitude range containing type I1\nPSCs [Kinne et al., 19891. The altitude distributions of NOy and\nH20+2CH4 in Table 1 provide a unique observational constraint\nfor understanding the microphysical processes that result in PSC\nformation, denitrification, and dehydration.\nAntarctic PSCs are observed between altitudes of 14 and\n28 km with a peak sighting frequency at -19 km during austral\nlate winter and early spring [Poole and Pitts, 19941. The [AH]\nand [AN] changes with O are roughly consistent with this\nTable 1.

REACTlVE\n\ndistribution below and near its peak altitude, but the variations\nabove 575 K are not: [AH] reaches a minimum at 600-700 K and\n[AN] is positive above 650 K with a peak of +5.6 ppbv at\n700-750 K, where the maximum descent indicated by [N20]\n(Fig. 1) occurs and high altitude O3 depletion has been reported\n[Hofmann et al., 19911.\nW e hypothesize that the positive [AN] inside the vortex result\nfrom downward transport of elevated NOy produced in the\nthermosphere and mesosphere. Evidence for such transport\nduring polar night was reported by Russell et al. [1984]. Model\nsimulations incorporating the winter descent of NOy-enriched air\nproduced in the thermosphere [Solomon et al., 19821 predict a\npocket of elevated NOy near 3 0 km at polar latitudes [Nevison\net al., 19961. Callis et al. [I9961 considered this source plus\nrelativistic electron precipitation in the mesosphere and lower\nthermosphere. Their simulations indicate that both sources\ncontributed significantly to the elevated NOy levels measured by\nATMOS.\nAside from dehydration, [AH] is determined by the chemistry\nof CH4 oxidation and the descent of air. In particular, high [H2]\nand low [H20] are calculated for this region during high latitude\nwinter [Le Texier e t al., 19881. W e suggest that [AH] above\n-575 K may have resulted from the descent in the vortex of\nH20-poor/)-Ez-rich air produced in the lower mesosphere during\nwinter. As temperatures below 195 K occurred up to 15 mbar\nduring the 1994 Antarctic winter, dehydration and denitrification\nmay also have played a role in determining [AH] and [AN] at the\nhigher altitudes.\n\n-\n\nAcknowledgments.

The H20 vertical distribution in the tropics\nexhibits a wave-like structure in the 16- to 25-km altitude\nrange, suggestive of seasonal variations in the water vapor\ntransported from the troposphere to the stratosphere. The\nhygropause appears to be nearly coincident with the tropopause at the time of observations. This is consistent with the\nphase of the seasonal cycle of H20 in the lower stratosphere,\nsince the ATMOS observations were made in November when\nthe H 2 0 content of air injected into the stratosphere from the\ntroposphere is decreasing from its seasonal peak in JulyAugust.\n\n+\n\nIntroduction\nThe stratospheric water vapor distribution is determined\nby a combination of chemical and dynamical processes. Chemical processes involving the oxidation of CH4 enhance the\nabundance of H20, producing approximately two molecules of\nH20 for each molecule of CH4 and leading to higher H20 mixing ratios with altitude relative to air entering the stratosphere,\nSince H20 is a major source of the reactive odd hydrogen species, and is considered to be an important tracer of transport\nfrom the troposphere to the stratosphere, measurements of its\n1\n\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center.\nHaward University.\n3\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.\n4\nSAIC-NASA Langley Research Center.\n5\nUniversity of Alabama at Huntsville.\n6\nDenver University.\n7\nCalifornia Institute of Technology.\n~orschungszentrumKarIsruhelUniversitaet Karlsruhe.\n9\nInstitute of Astrophysics, University of Liege.\n\nC o p p g h t 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GLO 1321\n\n0094-8534196196GL-01321$05.00\n\nstratospheric distribution have been extensive and have been\ncarried out with a variety of techniques including ground-based,\nand aircraft-, balloon-, and satellite-borne instruments [e.g.,\nHansen and Robinson, 1989; Gunson et al., 1990; McCormick\net al., 1993; Oltmans and Hofmann, 19951.\nThe ATMOSIATLAS-3 limb viewing solar occultation\nobservations of stratospheric trace constituents provide simultaneous measurements of H20 and CH4 distributions over the 8\nto 49% and 67 to 72\'s latitude ranges during November 3 t o\n12, 1994 [Gunson et al., 19961. This paper focuses on a portion of the retrieved data for the 16- to 35-km altitude range\nat northern mid-latitudes and tropics. We test the conservation\nof H = (H20 + 2CH4), deduce the annual average H20 mixing\nratio transported to the stratosphere, and examine profiles of\nHzO for evidence of seasonal variation of water vapor entering\ninto the stratosphere.\n\n~\n~ oxidation andhthe ~~d~~~~~ ~\nt\n~\n~\nthe Lower and Middle Stratosphere\n\n~ of\n~\n\nMethane is oxidized in the stratosphere mainly by reactions with OH and o(\'D) and to a lesser extent C1. The net\nresult of a series of reactions leads to formation of approximately two molecules of H20 for each molecule of CH4:\n\nIn addition to CH4 and H20, H2 is the only other abundant\nhydrogen-containing species in the stratosphere. Available in\nsitu balloon-bornelrocket measurements of molecular hydrogen in the stratosphere indicate nearly constant mixing ratio\nwith altitude, in accordance with a near balance between production by methane oxidation and loss by oxidation of H2\n[e.g., Ehhalt and Tonnisen, 1980; Brasseur and Solomon,\n19861. A major source of variability of H20 in the lower\nstratosphere is related to changes in CH4, owing to different\nphotolytic histories of individual air masses. Simultaneous\nobservations of H20 and CH4 enable us to assess whether\nchanges in H20 are related to oxidation of CH4, or some other\nprocess, and recent ATMOS measurements in the 16- to 35-km\naltitude range for a wide range of latitudes are examined to test\nour general understanding of the conservation of H and the\nhydrogen budget of the lower and middle stratosphere.\nA correlation plot of H20 versus CH4 for 47 profiles in the\n8 to 4 9 \' ~latitude range is shown in Figure 1.

The systematic uncertainty in the measurements of H20 and CH4 lead to total uncertainties of rt 0. l 6\nand rt 0.44 ppmv in slope and intercept, respectively. The\ninferred slope aH20/aCH4 G -2 implies that each CH4 molecule is converted into two molecules of H20, whereas the intercept 7.24 0.44 indicates approximately the average H in the\n18- to 35-km region. A precise determination of this slope and\nits deviation from -2 is important because of its implication\nfor the distribution of H2 in the stratosphere [Dessler et al.,\n1994; Abbas et al., 19961.\nObserved mixing ratio of Hz by balloon-borne instruments\nsuggest a small decrease with height in the 16- to 35-km range,\nvarying from -0.55 ppmv at the tropopause to -0.5 at 30 km\n[e.g., Ehhalt and Tonnisen, 19801. Assuming conservation of\nH and HZ, this would correspond to a slope aH20/aCH4\n-2.06. Dessler et al. [1994] inferred a value of aH20/aCH4 =\n-1.94 rt 0.27 in the lower stratosphere from measurements o n\nthe ER-2 aircraft. The aircraft, balloon-borne, and ATMOS data\nin the 16- to 35-km altitude range are all consistent statistically with conservation of H and with a aH20/aCH4 of -2.\nThe distribution of H with altitude and its deviation from a\nconstant value in the upper stratosphere and the mesosphere is\ndiscussed in another paper [Abbas et al., 19961.\nMeasurements of H by other experiments for comparison\nare: 6.0 ppmv from LIMS and SAMS data [Jones et al., 19861;\n7.0\n0.6 ppmv at 30 km from the ATMOS experiment o n\nSpacelab 3 [Gunson et al., 19901; 7.6 rt 0.6 ppmv from data\ncollected on the ER-2 aircraft [Dessler et al., 19941. It i s\nunlikely that an atmospheric process could be responsible for\nthe large differences in H observed by ATMOS and the combination of LIMS and SAMS. The Nimbus 7 satellite measurements of H have large systematic errors, as discussed by\nHansen and Robinson [1989]. A small part of the difference\nbetween values of H measured by the present ATMOS observations and the ATMOS data for April 1985 reported by Gunson\net al. [I9901 may be accounted for by long-term increases i n\nH 2 0 and CH4 [Oltmans and Hofmann, 1995; WMO, 19951.\n\n+\n\nDifferences in the determination of H based on the present\nATMOS observations and the in situ data reported by Dessler e t\nal. [I9941 lie within the systematic uncertainties of both sets\nof measurements, although the ATMOS value is lower by about\n0.4 ppmv. A comparison of ATMOS observations of H20,\nCH4, and N20 with nearly coincident in situ measurements\nobtained in the lower stratosphere during November 1994\nshows excellent agreement for each species, yielding virtually\nidentical values of H [Chang et al., 19961. For the November\n1994 coincidence, the only available in situ measurements of\nH20 and CH4 were obtained by the NOAA Lyman a hygrometer\nand the NOAA Airborne Chromatograph for Atmospheric Trace\nSpecies (ACATS) gas chromatograph, respectively. Dessler et\nal.\'s [I9941 estimate of H was based on observations of H20\nand CH4 from the Harvard Lyman a hygrometer and the Aircraft\nLaser Infrared Absorption Spectrometer (ALIAS) instrument,\nrespectively. During May 1993, measurements of H20 by the\nHarvard hygrometer exceeded those obtained by the NOAA\ninstrument by -15% [Hintsa et al., 19941, and measurements of\nCH4 by ALIAS were -10% lower than measurements by ACATS\n[Dessler et al., 19941. Consequently, the lower value of H\nmeasured by ATMOS relative to the in situ determination of\nDessler et al. [I9941 may be priniarily due to systematic differences in the measurement of H20, offset slightly by the differences in observations of CH4.\nThe value of H is important for assessing the average mixing ratio of H20 injected from the troposphere into the stratosphere. Our estimate for the annual average amount of H20\nentering the stratosphere is based on least square fits to\nATMOS measurements of H20 and CH4 collected over a wide\nrange of altitudes, rather than observations at the tropopause,\nto reduce the sensitivity of our result to seasonal and episodic\nvariations in HzO. ATMOS observations used in the fit were\nobtained in the 18- to 35-km altitude range, representing an\naverage over a period of -18 months, assuming upward velocities of -7 to 8 km per year (see discussion below).

This leads to an annually averaged\nH20 mixing ratio of 3.84 0.29 ppmv for air injected into\nthe stratosphere.\nPrevious in situ and satellite observations of this quantity\nare: Remsberg et al. [I9951 estimated an annual average value\nin the range of 3.2 to 3.7 ppmv the HALOE data; Dessler et al.\n[I9941 determined a value of 4.2 k 0.5 ppmv from ER-2 data;\nHansen and Robinson [I9891 reported 3.25 ppmv from\nLIMSISAMS data; while Jones et al. [I9861 reported 2.7 ppmv\nfrom an earlier analysis of the same satellite data. We note\nagain the possibility of large systematic errors that have not\nbeen fully quantified in the LIMSISAMS data [Hansen and\nRobinson, 19891. The discrepancy between ATMOS and in situ\nestimates of H20 entering the stratosphere lies with the systematic uncertainty of both sets of measurements. The in situ\nestimate, although based on measurements over the 17- to 20km altitude range, included a wide range of CH4 mixing ratios\n(0.9 to 1.5 ppmv) and should have a minor sensitivity to seasonal variations in H20. Systematic differences between measurements of H20 and CH4obtained by ATMOS and the in situ\nobservations of Dessler et al.

This structure, however, is largely\nsmoothed out when averaged over a sufficient number of occultations. In addition, there are systematic differences between\nthe results obtained from the three different optical bandpass\nfilters employed in the observations. To show this variability,\nwe plot in Figure 2 the profiles of H20 retrieved from data\nobtained during November 3 to 12, 1994, from three different\noptical band-pass filters, zonally averaged over: (i) nine occultations (8 to 2 8 \' ~ ) , with filter 3 in the 1580-3340 cm-\'\nregion, (ii) four occultations (9 to 2 2 \' ~ ) , with filter 4 in the\n3150-4800 cm-\' region, (iii) five occultations (12 to 26\'N),\nwith filter 9 in the 600 to 2,450 cm-\' region, and (iv) 1 8\noccultations (8 to 2 8 \' ~ ) using data from all filters.

By the time air\nreaches the mid-latitude region from the tropics, seasonal variations in H20 appear to have smoothed out.

Kelly, private communication]. Considering the 0.2-km vertical resolution of the\nER-2 measurements relative to the ATMOS field-of-view of\n-1.5 to 2 km, Figure 4 shows good agreement at lower altitudes\nbetween ATMOS, HALOE, and in situ measurements of H20.\nThe discrepancy between ATMOS and W E measurements of\nH20 mixing ratios at higher altitudes could be partly due to\nlatitudinal differences.\nIn view of seasonal variations in the water vapor entry into\nthe stratosphere with a minimum in January and maximum in\nJuly [e.g., Rind e t al., 1993; Boering e t a l . , 1995; Mote et a l . ,\n19951, a close examination of ATMOS profiles of H20 leads to\nthe following conclusions:\n(i) The minimum mixing ratio of H20 shown in Figures 2\nto 4 is coincident with the tropopause within the uncertainty of\nthe field-of-view of ATMOS (with the exception of filter 9\nmeasurements), consistent with the phase of the seasonal\ncycle, i.e., decreasing water vapor entry in November during\nthe observational period; a separation of the hygropause from\nthe tropopause would be expected in observations obtained a\nmonth or two after the minimum water vapor entry in JanuaryFebruary to a month or two after the maximum in July-August.\n(ii) Assuming that the local maximum in the mixing ratio\nof H20 at 19 km represents the upward transport of air that\nentered the stratosphere in July 1994 and the local minimum at\n22.5 km reflects entry in January 1994, the inferred annually\naveraged vertical velocity is estimated to be -7 to 8 k d y e a r\n(2.4 x\ncm s-\') near 22 km. This analysis strongly suggests that ATMOS measurements of H20 and CH4 are consistent with water vapor entry into the stratosphere in all seasons\nand air with minimum H20 mixing ratio enters in the winter\n(January-February) in the northern hemisphere and maximum\nin the summer (July-August).\n\nConclusions\nAn examination of the simultaneous measurements of H20\nand CH4 made by ATMOSIATLAS-3 indicates near conservation of the quantity H = ( H 2 0 + 2CH4) below altitudes of\nabout 35 km at midlatitudes. The data indicate that air enters\nthe stratosphere with an average H20 mixing ratio of -3.84 f\n0.29 ppmv. Vertical structure in averaged tropical profiles of\nH20 suggests seasonal variations in the mixing ratio of H20\nfor air entering the stratosphere, and an average velocity of -7\nto 8 k d y e a r in the lower stratosphere. The hygropause i s\nobserved to be within -2 km of the tropopause at tropical latitudes and is expected to be above the tropopause only when\nobserved in the January-February to July-August period, when\nthe H20 content of the air entering the stratosphere reaches its\nseasonal maximum.\n\nAcknowledgment.

The total hydrogen budget of the stratosphere and\nlower mesosphere has been examined using vertical mixing\nratio profiles of H20 and CH4 measured by the Atmospheric\nTrace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment from four\nspace shuttle missions. The oxidation of CH, and H2 is investigated by evaluating the quantity H (=H20 + 2 CH4) entering the\nstratosphere, and examining its conservation with altitude in\nthe upper atmosphere. Data from all four ATMOS missions\nindicate H to be nearly conserved in the lower stratosphere and\nto exhibit a broad maximum in the 35- to 65-km range. The\nobservations provide evidence of a secondary source of H20\nfrom H20xidation at altitudes from 35 to 55 km, and net production of H2 at altitudes above -55 km. ATMOS measurements\nof H20 and CH4 permit the first evaluation of a sickle-shaped\nvertical profile of H2 that is qualitatively consistent with profiles calculated using two-dimensional models.\n\nIntroduction\nStratospheric and lower mesospheric hydrogen resides\nmostly in H20, CH4, and H2 with negligible contributions to\nthe total budget expected from all other constituents. In the\nstratosphere, the oxidation of CH4produces approximately two\nmolecules of H20 for each molecule of CH4 that is removed, and\nthe gradient aH20/aCH4 is expected to be nearly equal to -2.\nProduction of H2 from oxidation of CH4 is nearly balanced by\noxidation of HZ, SO that the mixing ratio of H2 remains nearly\nconstant with altitude in the lower stratosphere. Model calculations [Le Texier et al., 19881 suggest the mixing ratio of H2\nreaches a broad minimum in the midstratosphere, where oxidation begins to proceed more rapidly, and increases at higher\naltitudes due to production from photolysis of H20. The few\nmeasurements of stratospheric Hz to date have been acquired by\nrockets or from balloons using grab sampling techniques and\nare limited to altitudes below -40 km [e.g., Ehhalt and\nTonnisen, 1980; Schmidt et al., 1974; Fabian et al., 1979).\nIn this paper, vertical profiles of H20 and CH4 measured by\nATMOS are examined to evaluate the hydrogen budget of the\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center.\nPropulsion Laboratoy, California Institute of Technology.\n3 University of Alabama at Huntsville.\nHarvard University.\n5 California Institute of Technology.\nSAIC - NASA Langley Research Center.\n7 Denver University.\nForschungszentrum KarlsruheNniversitaet Karlsruhe.\n9Institute of Astrophysics, University of Liege.\n\nstratosphere and lower mesosphere.

The distribution of H2 is inferred by calculating the\naverage Htotentering the lower stratosphere, and requiring the\ntotal hydrogen Hto,= H + H2 to be conserved with altitude.\n\nPhotochemistry of Stratospheric Hydrogen\nCompounds\nThe distribution of H20 in the stratosphere is maintained by\noxidation of CH4 by reaction with OH, O(\'D), and to a lesser\nextent C1, producing formaldehyde (CH20) with a chain of reactions [e.g., Bates and Nicolet, 1965; Ehhalt and Tonnisen,\n1980; Brasseur and Solomon, 19861. Formaldehyde is converted into Hz, CO, and H20 by photolysis and reaction with\nOH. The end products of the above chain of reactions are hydrogen radicals (H, OH, and HOz) with lifetimes of less than a day,\nwhich quickly recombine to form H20 mainly with the reaction\n\nand constitute the main photochemical source of water vapor in\nthe stratosphere. Water vapor is lost in the stratosphere by\n\nand in the mesosphere by photclysis\n\nH2 is produced by\n\nand is lost by oxidation due to OH and O(ID), similar t o\nmethane,\n\n2 Jet\n\nCopyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 96GLO 1320\n0094-8534/96/96GL-0 1320$05.00\n\nH~+o(\'D) + O H + H .\n\n(9)\n\none-dimensional photochemical model calculations using\nthe ATMOS atmospheric profiles indicate that the major source\n(80 to 95%) of Hz in the stratosphere and the lower mesosphere\nup to altitudes of -55 km is the photolysis of CH20 (Eq. 4)\nwith a minor contribution from reaction (5). In the mesosphere\nat altitudes above 55 km, H + H02 and the photolysis of H20\n(Eqs. 6 and 7) dominate the production of H2. Loss of H2 in the\nstratosphere occurs by reaction with OH (Eq. 8), while loss in\nthe mesosphere is dominated by reaction with O(ID) (Eq. 9).\n2405\n\n\'J\n\n//\n\'\n\n2406\n\nABBAS ET AL.: HYDROGEN BUDGET OF THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nThe three species CH4, H20, and H2 are rather long lived in the\nlower stratosphere with similar photochemical lifetimes of\nmany years; lifetimes decrease to only a few months at 40 km.\nIn the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere, the lifetime of\nH2increases progressively back to a few years. The time constants for transport for the three species at stratospheric altitudes are comparable to the photochemical lifetimes [e.g.,\nLe Texier et al., 19881; consequently, the effect of transport\nprocesses is significant in determining global distributions.\n\nWater Vapor and Methane Distributions\nHigh-resolution, infrared, limb-viewing, solar-occultation\nobservations by ATMOS have been carried out on four shuttle\nmissions starting with Spacelab 3 in May 1985, and ATLAS 1\nto 3 in April 1992, April 1993, and November 1994, respectively. Data from each mission with the same instrument have\nbeen processed in a similar manner using ATMOS version 2\nprocessing algorithms [Gunson et al., 19961. These observations provide simultaneous measurements of mixing ratio profiles of H20 and CH40ver various latitudes, employing optical\nbandpass filters in the 1,100 to 2,000 cm-", 650 to 2,450\ncm-l, and 1,580 to 3,420 cm-\' spectral regions. ATMOS\nretrieves mixing ratios of H20 and CH4 with estimated total\nuncertainties of -6% and 5%, respectively [Gunson et al.,\n19961. A comparison of ATMOS observations of H20, CH4,\nand N20 with nearly coincident in situ measurements obtained\nin the lower stratosphere during November 1994 demonstrates\nthe high degree of accuracy and precision of the space-borne\nobservations [Chang et al., 19961. The current analyses examine the H20 and CH4 measurements obtained from the four\nATMOS missions, with a particular emphasis on the\ncomprehensive data provided by the ATLAS3 mission\n\n10+1\n\n-\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI " "\n\nI " "\n\nobtained over the 8 to 4 9 \' ~\nlatitude range. The high accuracy\nand precision of these measurements permits a qualitative\nevaluation of the total hydrogen budget of the upper atmosphere.\nFigure 1 shows correlation plots of H20 versus CH4 for all\nfour ATMOS missions, restricted to data obtained out of the\npolar vortex regions indicated by a marked decrease in CH4 and\nN20 profiles, with the open circles representing data obtained\nin the 18- to 35-km range and the crosses representing data outside this range. The dotted lines in Figure 1 with fixed slopes of\n-2 represen; expected distributions if oxidation of each CH4\nmolecule were to produce two molecules of HzO.Deviations of\nthe data from a slope of -2 provide information about the total\nhydrogen budget of the stratosphere. The solid lines in Figure 1\nshow a linear least square fit to all measurements obtained\nbetween altitudes of 18 and 35 km. This altitude region was\nchosen to restrict our analysis to stratospheric air, for regions\nwhere the mixing ratio of Hz is not expected to vary appreciably [e.g., Le Texier et al., 19881.\nThe slopes of the linear fits in Figure 1 representing averages of four values derived from data with lower altitude varying\nfrom 18 to 21 km, and the upper altitude at 35 km, are: -2.09 rt\n0.13 for Spacelab 3; and -2.11 rt 0.08, -2.14 f 0.08, and 1.99\nk 0.07 for ATLAS 1 to 3 missions, respectively, with the\nuncertainties indicating the l o standard deviation of the linear\nregression. The estimated total uncertainties in the slope,\naccounting for the total uncertainty in the measurements of\nH20 and CH,, are: rt 0.21 for Spacelab 3; and f 0.18, 0.19, and\n0.17 for ATLAS 1 to 3, respectively. The weighted mean slope\na H20 CH, = -2.05 rt 0.16 for the four ATMOS missions\nindicates near conservation of H in the lower and middle stratosphere.

With estimated systematic errors of 6% for\nH 2 0 and 5% for CH4, the total uncertainties in the intercept are\ncalculated to be: f 0.43 ppmv for Spacelab 3; and f 0.43, 0.41,\nand 0.40 ppmv for ATLAS 1 to 3, respectively. Our estimate for\nthe amount of H 2 0 entering the stratosphere is based on linear\nleast square fits to ATMOS measurements of H20 and CH4 collected over a wide range of altitudes and latitudes, rather than\nactual observations at the tropopause, to minimize the sensitivity of our results to seasonal variations on H20. Seasonal\noscillations present in individual ATMOS occultations are\nlikely to be averaged out by this process, since air with a variety of ages is examined [Dessler et al., 19941. Using a CH4\nmixing ratio of 1.70 ppmv for 1994 at the tropopause, and\nassuming an average yearly CH4 increase of 0.46%/year\nbetween 1990 and 1994 and a 0.73%/year increase over the\nperiod 1985 to 1989 [WMO, 19941, we deduce the H20 content\nof air entering the stratosphere for the four missions to be:\n3.48 f 0.26 ppmv for Spacelab 3; and 3.51 f 0.27, 3.72 f\n0.28, and 3.83 f 0.29 ppmv for ATLAS 1 to 3, respectively. A\nmean value of 3.70 f 0.28 ppmv of H20 entry into the stratosphere, weighted to the number of observed occultations, i s\nthus inferred from the data base of the four ATMOS missions.\nThe mean value of H20 entering the stratosphere compares\nwith annual average values in the range of 3.2 to 3.7 ppmv\nestimated by Remsberg et al. [I9951 from the data set obtained\nby HALOE from 1992 to 1994, and the value 4.2 f 0.5 ppmv\nobtained by in situ measurements during May 1993 [Dessler et\nal., 19941; the discrepancy between these values, however, i s\nwithin the uncertainty of measurements. A more detailed comparison of the hydrogen budget inferred by ATMOS with analy-\n\nses based on other remote and in situ measurements is given i n\nAbbas et al. [1996], which focuses on the seasonal variation of\nH20 in the tropical lower stratosphere observed by ATMOS.\nThe lower stratosphere observed by ATMOS during the\nSpacelab 3 mission in April 1985 appears dry relative to the\nlater ATMOS measurements. It is unclear what significance, if\nany, to attach to the apparent trend in the H20 content of air\nentering the stratosphere inferred from the four missions,\nwhich with ATLAS 1 data excepted, appears to be of the same\norder as a 0.8% per year trend in stratospheric H20 that has\nbeen inferred from a 10-year time series of frost-point hygrometer measurements at Boulder, CO [Oltmans and Hofmann,\n19951. A more comprehensive analysis to address the significance of the apparent trend should account fully for the different\nlatitudinal and seasonal coverage of the four missions, possible biases associated with the ATMOS retrievals of H20 using\nits various optical filters, as well as an examination of satellite, balloon-borne, and in situ measurements of CH4 and H20\nover the past decade.\n\nHydrogen Budget of the Stratosphere and Lower\nMesosphere\nSimultaneous measurements of HzO and CH4 provided by\nATMOS permit an evaluation of the partitioning of hydrogen\nspecies in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere. The correlation plots (Figure 1) for all four missions indicate an excess of\nH20 relative to the amount supplied by oxidation of CH4, for\nCH4 less than -0.5 ppmv (corresponding to altitudes of -35\nkm). The excess H20 present in this region of the correlation\nplots is evidence of a source of H20 from oxidation of H2. For\nCH4rnixing ratios less than -0.2 ppmv (altitudes of -50 km),\nH20 and CH4 are positively correlated, implying the conversion of H20 and CH4 to Hz by reactions H + H02 and photolysis of HzO (Eqs. 6 and 7).\nA vertical distribution for H2 can be inferred from ATMOS\nmeasurements of H20 and CH4 by assuming total hydrogen\n\nHtOt=(H + H2) transported to the lower stratosphere from the\ntroposphere is conserved with altitude. Figures 2a-b show the\naverage vertical profiles of CH4, H20, and H obtained from 2 7\nATLAS-3 representative sunset occultations for midlatitudes i n\nthe 28 to 4 9 \' ~range, and from 13 occultations for low latitudes\nin the 8 to 2 8 \' ~\nrange, respectively. The error bars indicate the\nquadrature sum of lo standard deviation of the mean values and\nsystematic errors arising from 6% and 5% uncertainties in the\nspectral parameters of H20 and CH4. The vertical profiles of H\nhave been smoothed using polynomial curves above -35 km\nand linear fits in the lower region, in order to remove smallscale structures. It is clear from both the observed and\nsmoothed plots that H is not conserved with altitude. The\nmaximum of the quantity H a t altitudes higher than 50 km indicates that production of H2 by H + H02 and photolysis of H20\nbecomes important at these altitudes.\nDistributions of H2 have been derived by subtracting the\nsmoothed curve fit for H from a constant value for Htotof 7.80\nppmv assuming a tropospheric mixing ratio of H2= 0.55 ppmv\n[Ehhalt and Tonnisen, 19801 and a value of H = 7.25 ppmv\nbased on ATMOSIATLAS-3 observations in the MI at midlatitudes and the tropics. The minimum mixing ratio inferred for H2\noccurs at -50 km with values of 0.15 f 0.1 ppmv at mid-latitudes and 0.18 f 0.1 pvmv at the tropics. The uncertaintv i n\nthis case represents the standard deviation of the mean profile\nfor H, and does not include systematic errors in the measurements of H20 and CH4. The inferred profile for H2 is sensitive\nalso to seasonal and episodic variations in H, neither of which\nare accounted for in the present analysis. For example, profiles\nfor H2 inferred from ATLAS 1 measurements (not shown)\nexhibit a shallower minimum (less variation with altitude) than\nprofiles shown in Figure 2.\nA comparison of the plots in Figures 2a-b shows that the\nmixing ratios of H20 are higher and of CH4 are lower at the\nmidlatitudes for altitudes below -50 km, as expected from the\nBrewer circulation. Consistent with the indicated latitudinal\ndifferences in H20 and CH4 distributions, the inferred H2 mixing ratios are higher in the midlatitude stratosphere below 5 0\nkm where CH4 mixing ratios are higher and H2 is produced by\noxidation of CH4 via C H20. In the mesosphere above 50 km,\nH2produced by H + H02 and photolysis of H20 leads to higher\nvalues in the tropics compared with the midlatitudes.\nFigure 2c shows a comparison of the inferred H2 distributions with the profiles for midlatitudes and the tropics calculated by Le Texier et al. [I9881 using a two-dimensional model\nwith coupled photochemistry and dynamics. Also shown by\nopen circles are the observed values of H2 limited to an altitude\nof 35 km, at 32% [Ehhult and Tonnisen, 19801. Although the\ninferred Hz distributions for midlatitudes appear to be qualitatively similar to the model calculations, the minimum inferred\nvalues are lower than the model values. The altitude of minimum Hz, however, appears to be in general agreement with the\ntwo-dimensional model. Model calculations by Le Texier et al.\nindicate that mesospheric transport effects are important for\nhigh latitudes in the winter where air rich in H,is transported to\nlower altitudes in the stratosphere. Since such large values of\nH2 have not been inferred for the low and midlatitude regions\nconsidered here, consistent with the model calculations of Le\nTexier et al., the effect of mesospheric transport does not\nappear to be evident. In a recent work brought to-our attention,\nHarries et al. [I9961 have employed a similar technique for\ninferring mixing rations of H2in the mesosphere from HALOE\nmeasurements. Although the high mixing ratios above 0.5 mb\nlevels inferred in their study are qualitatively consistent with\nthe results presented here, a comparison for lower levels cannot\n\nbe made at this time because of different assumptions employed\nin the two studies.\n\nConclusions\nAn examination of measurements of H20 and C CH4made by\nATMOS indicates that the quantity H = (H20 + 2 CH4) is conserved in the lower and middle stratosphere and yields an aver0.28\nage water vapor entry into the stratosphere of 3.70\nppmv. H is not conserved in the upper stratosphere and lower\nmesosphere; it reaches a maximum at -50 to 55 km, then\ndecreases with height. This structure is evident in the correlation plots of H 2 0 versus CH4for all four missions. The region\nnear -50 km is characterized by an excess abundance of H20\n-0.4 ppmv, providing evidence of a source of H20 from oxidation of Hz, whereas the decrease in H observed at higher altitudes implies net production of H2 from H20 and CH4. The distribution of H2inferred from variation of H with altitude indicates a sickle-shaped profile with a constant mixing ratio at\naltitudes of 135 km, a minimum at -50 km, and increasing t o\n>1 ppmv above 65 km. The inferred distribution of Hz is i n\nqualitative agreement with the values obtained from a twodimensional coupled photochemical-dynamical model.\n\n+\n\nAcknowledgments.

The\nvortex has already broken down in the upper stratosphere (Fig. 1) and is being substantially eroded in\nthe middle stratosphere (Fig. 2a), with rapid weakening of sPV gradients during ATLAS-3. The lower\nstratospheric vortex (Fig. 2b) remains strong, with sPV\ngradients weakening rapidly after mid-November. This\nevolution is typical, and similar to that in the previous\ntwo SH winters [e.g., Munney et al., 19941. As noted\nby Munney et u1. [1994], at the lowest levels (-375-420\nK) , the vortex remains strong into December.\n\nSH winter lower stratospheric vortex temperatures\nare typically low enough to form both type I and type\nI1 polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) for several months,\nwith important consequences for ozone depletion, dehydration and denitrification. The 1994 SH winter was\nfairly typical in this respect, and very similar to the 1992\nSH winter [Manney and Zurek, 19931. Temperatures\nfirst dropped below 195 I< (a convenient approximation\nto the type I PSC threshold) around 10 May and below 188 K (approximately the type I1 PSC threshold)\naround 5 June. In late July, temperatures less than\n195 I< extended from -100-7 hPa and temperatures less\nthan 188 I< from -90-10 hPa. Cold regions appear first\nnear 20 hPa, and persist latest near 100-50 hPa.

The persistent region of\ntemperatures below 195 K disappeared around 20 Oct,\nbut a slight cooling led to a small region of temperatures below 195 I< over the Palmer peninsula between\n28 Oct and 2 Nov. The SH ATLAS-3 measurements\nwere thus made 35-45 days after the last occurrence of\ntype I1 PSC temperatures, and only a few days after\nthe last occurrence of type I PSC temperatures.\n\nFigure 4.

The projection is orthographic, with O0 at the top and 90\xc2\xb0E\nto the right; thin dashed lines are 30\' and 60\'s.

Layout is as in Fig. 4.\n\nFig. 4 shyws SH PV at 655 K (-20 hPa) throughout\nATLAS-3, in relation to ATMOS measurements. The\nvortex shape changes during ATLAS-3, but it remains\nshifted off the pole towards -270\xc2\xb0E, so most of the ATMOS measurements between 180\' and 360\xc2\xb0E fall within\nthe vortex at this level; thus, cross-sections of trace\nspecies constructed from ATMOS measurements over\nthe 10 day period [e.g., Abrarns et al., 1996; Rinsland\net al., 19961give a reasonable picture of the longitudinal\nvariations in the observations. The location shown by a\ntriangle on 6 Nov is used by Rinsland et al. [I9961 as an\nexample of an extra-vortex measurement; at 655 K, this\nis in fact subtropical air (dark shading) that has been\n\ndrawn up around the vortex. The triangle on 10 Nov is\nused as an example of a vortex interior measurement.\nFig. 5 shows sPV at several other levels on 4 NOV\n1994. The vortex is shifted in the same direction at all\nlevels, with higher levels farther off the pole. The measurement shown by a triangle is examined in detail by\nNewchurch et al. [I9961 and is within the vortex at all\nlevels. As shown in Fig. 1,sPV gradients at 1100 K (and\nabove) are weak, and only a small remnant of vortex air\nis seen. At 375 K, although strong sPV gradients exist,\ngradients are weak at some longitudes, suggesting that\nthe average strong gradients (Fig. 1) at this level may\nindicate a weaker transport barrier than at higher levels\nwhere strong sPV gradients are continuous around the\ncircumference of the vortex.\nAlthough the sPV fields shown above suggest material may be drawn up from low latitudes and pulled off\nthe vortex, the extent of this behavior is not obvious in\nthe relatively low resolution sPV fields calculated from\nthe UKMO data. To get a more complete picture of\nthe circulation outside the vortex, we use reverse trajectory calculations [Sutton et al., 19941 (done on an\nequal area grid with 0.8O latitude spacing and 0.8O longitude spacing at the equator, and run isentropically\nfor 10 days using UKMO winds) to generate simulated\nhigh-resolution sPV fields. Fig. 6 shows such fields for\n4 Nov 1994. The vortex remnant at 1100 K is still\nseparated from the exterior flow; however, lower sPV\nmaterial characteristic of the vortex exterior is being\nmixed with the remaining "vortex" air. At both 1100\nand 840 K, long tongues of material with sPV typical of the vortex edge are drawn out into low latitudes\nand coiled up with very low sPV air drawn up around\nthe vortex. Calculations for vertical sections show that\nthese tongues are relatively deep, extending down to at\n\nr\n\nI NOV 1094\nP\n%\n\n2.4\n\n-\n\nI\n\nu.d 2.0\n\nu.0\n--\n\n-\n\nP\n\n- 12\n\nL.0,"\nFigure 6.
