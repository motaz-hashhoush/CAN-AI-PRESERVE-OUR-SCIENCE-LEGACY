Often this optimization\n\nprocedure is necessary in the opposite direction where weight and power are\n\nlimited. The technique, however, usually proceeds equally well in either\n\ndirection, once the independent and dependent variables are identified.\n\nThe type of mass spectrometer discussed in this study is the Quadrupole\n\nMass Filter 1,2,3,4, and 5 which has been selected in several experiments\n\nfor analysis of the earth\'s upper atmosphere and potentially for planetary\n\natmospheres. For the above purposes, it is typically operated in one of\n\nthree general modes, as follows:\n\na. \t Open Ion Source. Ambient particles are ionized with limited\n\nenergy (temperature) equilibration to the ion source; ionizing\n\nchanter gas density limited to ambient density as modified by\n\npartial accommodation to ion source temperature and surface\n\nconditions.\n\nb. \t Closed Ion Source, Close-Coupled to Ambient. Ambient particles\n\nare thermalized to ion source temperature; gas density established\n\nby transpiration flow to ambient atmosphere or to a thermalizing\n\nchamber.\n\nc. \t Closed Ion Source,,Excess Sample. Particles are thermalized to ion\n\nsource temperature; gas density is established by flow through an\n\ninlet system from high pressure and is limited only by the leak\n\nrate as determined for the desired system operating conditions.\n\nFor the purpose of this report a generalized configuration of a Mode 2\n\nion source and the quadrupole is shown in Figure 1.\n\nEach mode of operation requires a slightly different treatment and will\n\narrive at a different optimum instrument. For example, analysis of energetic\n\nparticles with an open ion source will generally require a larger system in\n\norder to accept the diverse paths of the particles. Conversely, high ambient\n\npressure generally permits use of a smaller instrument when the ion source\n\ncan operate at its linear limit of gas density. Other modes of operation\n\ncan arise with a similar requirement for modification of the constraints.\n\nHowever, this discussion is limited to the three listed.\n\n\nMETHOD OF OPTIMIZATION\n\nBefore an optimum instrument can be derived, a definition of the problem\n\nis typically given. For this study, since a range of applications was con\xc2\xad\ntemplated, attention was directed at maximizing the specific sensitivity of\n\nthe mass spectrometer. Additional elements of the optimization procedure are\n\nrequired in order to arrive at a complete instrument.\n\nExpressing this analytically, the performance to be achieved can be given as\n\ntotal sensitivity:\n\nn\n\nn\n(ST\n\n.\n\n=\n\n(eo\n\no/no\n\nvolts output/unit density, ambient; for ii species, readable in the density\nranges\n(min) < (n)\n\n(n)\n\n< (n)\n\n(max),\n\nunder a given set of operating conditions and in a given environment. The\n\nsolution to the problem requires a consideration of interfering species at\n\nvarious density levels, both directly as ion fragment current and indirectly\n\nas "noise" (e.g., neutrals and secondary effects); the system linearity at\n\nhigh ambient densities; the system noise at low ambient densities as well as\n\nthe implied design and operational parameters.\n\nAssuming for each species a relationship between ambient and ion source\n\ngas density,\n\nns = H\n\n(1)\n\n\nn\n\nwhere H1 is generally a time varying function relating both to the sampling\n\nmode and vehicle orientation.\n\nThe current formed, IF, by electron beam bombardment of the gas is\n\nsubstantially linear with density,\n\n(2)\n\nI+=K n\na s\nF\n+\nThe ion current collected I+ can be expressed as,\n\nC\n\n+\n2C =\n\n2\n\n+~\nSA\ns \n IF\n\n\nr\n\n(3)\n\n\nwhere OS = ion source transmission efficiency and OA = mass analyzer trans\xc2\xad\nmission efficiency, each of which is in general a function of the mass\n\nspectrometer operating conditions.\n\nFor the purposes here, the output voltage, e., can be assumed pro\xc2\xad\nportional to collected current, or\n\neo = K\n\n+\n\n(4)\n\ncombining (1) to (4),\n\nST = eo/no = Ka Kb\n\n(5)\n\n\nS A H\n0\n\nA knowledge of the variables under a given set of conditions, then\nallows determination of the unknown gas densities (no) by observation of\n0\n\ne..\n\n1.\n\n01\n\nThis study is then concerned with maximizing the product\n\nKa 0S 0A = S,\n\nthe specific mass spectrometer sensitivy, in amperes ion current/unit density\n\nin the ion source, i.e.,\n\nS = l1/n s \n K\n=\n\nos\n\na\n\n0 a\nSA\n\n\n(6)\n\nIn this approach, all of the performance parameters are analytically\n\nrelated and summarized in the one parameter S which then becomes a function\n\nof size, weight and power. The optimum instrument is then inferred by the\n\nleast value of weight (as a summary parameter) that satisfies the sensitivity\n\nand signal-to-noise ratio required in the problem.\n\nWhile H1 is an important variable in the complete problem, it is only\n\ndiscussed to the extent that it impacts the mass spectrometer input con\xc2\xad\ndition in the mode of operation as described in the Introduction.\n\nThe method of optimizing S takes one of two approaches, depending\n\nupon whether the quadrupole analyzer is operated in the "flat-topped peak"\n\nor "pointed peak" condition, (these terms are more fully defined on the\n\ndefinition pages of Appendix 4).\n\nThe first case where the instrument is designed and tuned to produce\n\nflat-topped peaks requires that \xc2\xaeA = 1.0; i.e., 100% of the ion current\n\nreceived by the analyzer is transmitted and collected. The great importance\n\n\n3\n\nof this characteristic is that minor variations of the analyzer operating\n\nconditions or the particle initial conditions do not influence the accuracy\n\nof the measurement. This, along with an ion source that is to.first order\n\nindependent of particle initial conditions (described later), is an essential\n\nfactor in substantiating the measurements in certain space experiments.\n\n0\nIt is found that optimization can be approximated when A = 1.0. Ana\xc2\xad\nlyzer entrance conditions of angle, position and energy of the particle will\n\nbe solved in terms of desired resolution and peak shape. Secondly, this\n\nequation is substituted in an expression for OS . OS is then differentiated\n\nfor a maximum with respect to the remaining variables.\n\n\nIn the pointed-peak mode BA (<1.0) becomes intimately a function of the\n\nelectrical operating conditions of the quadrupole. Since there is as yet no\n\nclosed, simple expression for transmission of the quadrupole as a function\n\nof the various conditions, optimization is a lengthly iterative procedure.\n\nIn practice an open-ended solution of 0 A for a given set of conditions is\n\nusually possible.\n\nThe quadrupole mass analyzer is first described in terms of its operat\xc2\xad\ning parameters in the next section. Subsequent sections, respectively,\n\nanalyze the ion source parameters and combine the two equations.\n\n\nANALYZER CHARACTERISTICS\n\n\nBy continuing the use of the optimization techniques of Reference 3 it\n\nis found that the quadrupole functions in a manner that appears similar in\n\nform to a double-focusing magnetic mass spectrometer with first order\n\ncoefficients of angle and entry position equal to zero. It is thus an\n\ninstrument of higher order. The equations can then be solved simultaneously\n\nwith the ion source equations to optimize performance and establish\n\nsensitivity.\n\nIn general terms, all mass spectrometers operate within limits imposed\n\nby the solid angle of ion source emission, a 2 , the area, Ae, of ion emission\n\nand the upper and lower limits of an energy or velocity band, +S where\n\n=\n\nV\n\n-\n\nand v = velocity.\n\n\n0\n\nThe quadrupole is no exception. It is the object of the optimization process\n\nto maximize this multi-dimensional "volume" to obtain the greatest current\n\noutput. However, the quadrupole is different than most other mass spectrom\xc2\xad\neters in the nature of imposition of penalties of weight and power in addi\xc2\xad\ntion to it being unique in providing versatility.\n\nAssume that the operation of the quadrupole analyzer is understood\n\nfrom prior work (c.f., References 1-5). Further, the analysis assumes that\n\nthe quadrupole functions in a theoretical manner with respect to ion en\xc2\xad\ntrance conditions, i.e., the position, angle and energy of the ion as\n\ninjected from the ion source arrive in a pure quadrupole field without end\n\neffects. Both quadrupole biasing3 with nozzle injection and segmented rods 4\n\nattempt to nullify or improve upon the effects of quadrupole rod termina\xc2\xad\ntion; however, the full effects are not known.\n\n\nScanning and Resolution\n\nFollowing common usage, the coordinate system is oriented with the z\n\naxis along the axis of the rod structure, y is through the negative pair\n\nof rods and x through the positive pair (see Figure 1). Then from the\n\nquadrupole operating equations,\n\n\n8 e Vdc\n2 2\nmr\n\nW\n0\n\n4\n\n\nandq=\n\ne Vac\n22\n\n(7)\n\n0)\n\nmr\n0\n\n5\n\nwhere\n\na, q = dc and ac stability parameters,\n\ne = electronic charge (couloumbs),\n\nVdc = applied dc rod voltage (volts),\n\n\nV\n\n=\n\napplied ac rod voltage (volt-peak),\n\nm = ion mass (kg.),\n\n\nr\n\n= characteristic rod spacing from the axis (meters),\n\n\nw = angular frequency of applied ac voltage (radians/sec),\n\na technique of sweeping or scanning the spectrum can be described.\n\nWith reference to the stability diagram in Figure 2- (a and b), which\nshow a very select portion of the overall stability characteristics, the\nregion of interest is around a = 0.23699 and q = 0.706. Charged particles\nare stable when Oy > o and o < x < 1, consequently within the triangular\nregion. Scan lines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 depict lines of constant ratio:\na/q = 2 Vdc/Vac\n\n(8)\n\n\nwhich pass through the stability diagram when a given mass-to-charge ratio\n\nm/e is in the quadrupole field and as Vac or w is varied. Higher resolu\xc2\xad\ntion is achieved by increasing the scan line slope, a/q. Equation (7) can\n\nbe used to establish parametric values which produce stability.\n\nIn order to define the normal scanning performance, it is desirable to\n\nrelate the peak shape to the stability diagram. Figure 3 depicts the ion\n\ncurrent transmitted through the quadrupole as a function of q, (and as im\xc2\xad\nplied by constant a/q) as the peak is scanned.\n\nAs a and q increase along scan line 3, for instance, ions of say\n\n(m/e), are nominally stable in both x and y direction between A and D.\n\nHowever, a small, increasing current is transmitted and observed upon\n\napproaching A, which is due to ions of (m/e), unstable in the y direction\n\nwhich do not reach the rods for discharge within the limited length of the\n\nrod system. The longer the rods, the greater will be the fraction of\n\n2\n\nunstable particles that reach amplitude r o and are eliminated. Brubaker\nshows typical paths while the Quadrupole Ion Entrance Mask study of this\n\nfinal report shows the envelope of motion of unstable particles.\n\nAt the stability boundary at A, ions of (m/e), become y theoretically\n\nstable; however, they can also have a stable amplitude that is larger than\n\n\n6\n\nro depending on their initial angle and position off-axis. As the scan line\n\nis followed from A to B, ions with successively larger y angles and\n\noffset have stable amplitudes less than r o and are transmitted. If the\n\nangle and offset are bounded at small value, they all have maximum ampli\xc2\xad\ntudes less than ro and 100% of the current is transmitted between B and C.\n\nThe effects are approximately the same in reverse order upon crossing the\n\nx stability boundary from C to D and beyond. The correlation with peak\n\nshape is apparent from Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3 also shows the peak width characteristics defined as the\n\nfollowing:\n\nqT = peak top width measured in q\n\nAq = theoretical peak width between boundaries measured in q.\n\nAqB = peak base width to a defined fraction of peak height,\n\nmeasured in q (see definitions, Appendix 4).\n\nAqxy = increments of q taken by peak sides\nAqt x\'y = increments of q taken by tail.\n\nThese elements of peak shape will be used below.\n\nConsidering, then, the technique of scanning, it becomes apparent that\n\nsweeping voltage has certain advantages. While the spectrum could be\n\nscanned by holding Vac constant and varying w especially if it is desired\n\nto continuously sweep a wide mass range, simple low power and precise\n\nmethods of doing this have not yet been demonstrated. One advantage of\n\nthe voltage scan is the simple time relationship that is easily produced.\n\nFrom (7) if w and r\nm = KV\n\nare constant,\n\n\nac\n\n\n(9)\n\nthus, if we let V ac\n = kt where t = time,\n\nm = Kkt\nand the peaks are equally spaced in time.\nthe calculations of this report.\n\n\n(10)\nVoltage scanning is assumed in\n\n\n7\n\nIt is also possible to maintain constant resolution during the scan.\n\nResolution is defined in Appendix 4, but can be more readily visualized\n\nfrom Figure 4a. Two adjacent, equal sized peaks are considered resolved if\n\ntheir contribution to the valley between them is equal or less than a speci\xc2\xad\nfied fraction of the peak height. A stated resolution, m/Am is reached when\n\nthe contributions are equal to the specified value.\n\nTaking this limiting case, two mass peaks are resolved when from (7),\n\nVac\nav\n\nV\nthus,\n\nac\n\nac\n\nV\n\nm = constant\n\n3m\n\n__q,\n\n-\n\n\nm\n\n\nq\nAq\n\n-= s\n\nac\n\nq = constant\n\n, or, for small increments, we assume\n\n\nA m/m, where Aq\n\nis the peak separation\n\n(12)\n\n\nS\n\nq\n\nFor the example in Figure 4a,\n\n(13)\n\n\nAqs = AqB = q A m/m\n\nIn the more general case, the peak separation expressed by qAm/m can be\n\ngreater or less than AqB for adjustment of peak overlap, thus we let\n\nkm AqB\n\n=\n\nAqs\n\n=\n q\n\n(14)\n\n\nA m/m\n\nFor km = 1, the peaks are resolved at the base by the conventional de\xc2\xad\nfinition. For km = 1/2, as shown in Figure 4b, the tail of adjacent peaks\n\nreach the measured peak center and the crosstalk becomes predominant. This\nwe define by the tail fraction 0 at the edge of the peak base. Other degrees\nof overlap can be achieved by 1/2 < k < 1.\nm\n\nIn order to establish the conditions where each peak is just resolved\n\nfrom its neighbor (unit resolution) let\n\nA m/m = mu/m or AqB\n\n=\n\n0.706 mu/kmm\n\n(15)\n\n\nwhere m u = unit mass.\n\nFrom (8)\n\nVdc\n\n8\n\n=\n\naV\n\nac\n2q\n\n(16)\n\n\nand letting a = apk -Aa\n\n0.706\'\n\n\nwhere a\n= 0.23699 = value of a at the peak of the stability diagram and\npk\n\nAa0.706 = increment of a between apk and the intercept of the scan\n\nline with q = 0.706,\n\n\nthen,\nVd\n\n=\n\nV\n\na\ndcaq \n\nj-\n\nk -Aa\n\nHowever, Aa0. 7 0 6 = 0.2524\n\n(17)\n\n0.706\'\nAq from the geometric relationship of the\n\n\nstability diagram and AqB = Aq + Aqt, (where Aqt = Aqt X + Aqty\n\nby\n\n\ndefinition from Figure 3).\n\nExperimentally it is found that Aqt remains constant if mass and Vac\n\nare constant as resolution is adjusted by increasing or decreasing Vdc. The\n\npeaks are seen to change in width in the central 100% transmission region\n\nwithout a marked change in shape or width of the tails. However, when\n\nscanning Vac and M, Aqt will change. From the Mask Study, Table I, Aqt\n\nappears to decrease with A m/m as m increases; i.e., approximately the\n\nsame number of cycles are required for an ion to reach the rod at a given\n\npercentage of Aq outside the boundary whether the scan line slope is set\n\nfor resolution 100 or 200.\n\nThus, we assume\n\n(Aqt) = ktl Aq,\n\n(18)\n\n\nwhere (Aqt) is a specific tail width giving the desired quality of resolution.\n\nAlso, for a given axial energy, the heavier ion will remain in the rod\n\nsystem for a greater number of cycles and thus have a higher probability of\n\nexclusion. Consequently, Aqt/Aq should even decrease at higher mass.\n\nAppendix 2 deals with the tail transmission probability and results in a\n\nrelatively complex expression.\nFor the purpose of describing the nature\n\nof unit resolution scanning we believe it is conservative albeit approxi\xc2\xad\nmate, to use (18).\n\n\n9\n\nThus, from (14), (17), and (18); AqB = Aq (1 + ktl)\n\n\nV ~kV\nand\n\nV\n\n= Vaca\ndc 2q\n\n0.2524\n-\n\nac\n2\n\nq\n\nqm\n\nu\nk m(1 +k t)\n\n(19)\n\n(9\n\n\nSubstituting from the quadrupole equation\n\n4eVe\n\nq =\n\n2\nmr\n\n0\n\n)\n\n\n2\nW\n\n\n0\n\nfor Vac in the second term, and from fixed values for ak/2q in the first\n\nterm;\n\n22\n\n\nVd\n\n0.16785 V\ndcac\n\n=\n\n- 0.1262\n\nU t0 (\n4 elkc (1 +k tl)\n\n\n(21)\n\n\nThe second term thus expresses a constant offset in Vdc that is estab\xc2\xad\nlished relative to Vac at unity mass.\n\nSummarizing this section, it is shown that a continuous scan of the\nspectrum can be adjusted for unit resolution throughout the spectrum and pro\xc2\xad\nvide that the masses occur at a uniform rate in time by letting Vdc = k 1\nVac - k2, and Vac = kt. For obtaining maximum information from such a scan,\nadjustment of km allows for overlap of peak sides and tails such that a mini\xc2\xad\nmum time is spent in measuring low utility information. ktl adjusts the\nbase width allowance for the tails. The techniques of either stepping Vac\nfrom peak-to-peak or by compressed scanning are necessary to maximize the\ninformation content of a mass spectrometer. The quadrupole further exhibits\nthe unique property among mass spectrometers of simple electrical adjustment\nto achieve both uniform pulse (peak) duration and repetition rate, as seen\nby the output measuring system, while maintaining a low ratio of lost time\nbetween peaks.\nEntrance Conditions for SA = 1.0\n\nFor 100% transmission through the quadrupole analyzer as considered\n\nhere, it is necessary to limit the maximum entrance angles ax and ay; the\n\ninitial off-axis position of the ion,\n\n\n10\n\nYe\n\n\nxe and\n\n(22)\n\n\n= r0\n\nand the maximum injected energy from the ion source into the quadrupole.\n\nWe establish these limits which govern sensitivity, through a tradeoff with\n\nresolution and peak shape.\n\nFrom Figure 3 we establish the base width\n\n(23)\n\nAqB = Aq + Aqt x + Aqty,\nand the top width,\nAqT = Aq - Aqx - Aq\n\nwhere expressions for Aqx\n\n(24)\n\n,\n\nAqt X and Aqty are to be developed.\n\n\nAq,\n\nThus the "scan space" taken up by the sides and tails of the peak is\n\ngiven by,\n\nAqB-\n\nAqT\n\nAqB\n(i\nor\n\n=\n\nAq + Aqt x \n+ Aq ty-\n\nAqT"\n\n\n(1---) =\nABB\n\nAq\n\nAq + Aqx + Aqy\n\nx\n\n+Aq\n\nAqty"\n\ny\n\n+Aqt+\ny +\n\nHowever, from (14), AqB = q Am/kmm.\n\nAlso, AqT/AqB is the top-to-base\n\n\nratio of the peak which we symbolize by T/B.\nqAm\n\nkmm\n\n+Aq\n\n(1 - T/B) =Aq\n\nX\n\nThus,\n\n+ A(26)\n\n\n+A\n\ny\n\n(25)\n\n\ntX\n\nActy.\n\n\nConsequently, we see that an improved peak shape (large T/B ratio) and\n\nhigher resolution can be achieved by minimizing the Aq values on the right\n\nhand side of the equation. It is interesting to note that this is identical\n\nin form to a symmetrical magnetic sector instrument in which\n\nAm\n\n(1 - T/E) = \n S1\n2\n\nmI\n\nini\n\n\n(27)\n\n\nwhere SI is the image or beam width and r the magnetic radius of curvature.\n\nThus, the sum of Aq values of (26) is analogous to beam width.

It is important then\n\nto examine this difference. There appears to be two explanations, as follows:\n\n(1) \t The G coefficients are in effect hybrid x and y plane coefficients,\n\nsince the q space equations were made equal for the two planes.\n\nThe scan line angle provided an advantage of 1.3/2.55 for the x\n\nplane, which when optimized reduced the effective y coefficients.\n\n(2) \t The computer provided a distribution of density versus Y and q.\n\na obtained from (30) is the largest value reached by any ion;\n\nereas in reality, we are dealing with a number distribution\n\nassociated with the function F1 Y + F 2 fly which has the distri\xc2\xad\nbution shown below if ions are uniformly distributed in Y and n.\n\nConsequently, an apparently improved resolution is obtained at the 100%\n\ntransmission intercept of Figure 5 because of the ion density at the limiting\n\nvalue.\n\n\n16\n\n+\n\nFlI y\n\nF\n\n+ F2 niy\n\n=\n\nCONST.\n\nF2 = CONST.\nF (Yy ) 5 F2(ny)\n\nConsequently, we retain the more realistic values of (41) to describe\n\nthe optimized (equalized x and y) 100% transmission edge.\n\nWe return to (35) where a satisfactory solution has been obtained for\n\nthe stable portion of the equation and now draw upon the results of Appen\xc2\xad\ndix 2 to describe the width of the peak tail.

This effect\nis a result of being able to increase ion current for the same\nionizing space charge when an increased repeller-accelerator\nvoltage, and thus axial ion velocity, is allowed. There are\nseveral practical limitations to extending this advantage very far,\nHowever, one important influence is the election beam thickness\nwhich also governs the AV to be accepted by the analyzer. A well\nfocused electron beam, such as from a line filament, can have the\n\nsame importance as a considerable increase in rod length.\n\n29\n\nConclusion c is only one of a series of parametric effects on the\n\nequation which can lead to practical improvements in transmission. We now\n\nreconstruct the equation in order to understand the physical effect of the\n\nvarious parameters.\n\nWe start with Equation (60) and recall that the area of the exit aper\xc2\xad\nture of the ion source is e = 4 r2 txiy. Calculating from (63) for (it)3\n\nand (ny)3 we find from our choices of F4 = .709 and F 2 = .508 that nx = ny\n\nor that we have a square exit aperture. (It is also recalled that an\n\nalternative assumption would have made F2 &BF4 and therefore nx fy.) If, for\n\nexample, we let Am/kmm = 1150, T/B = 0.5 and with q = 0.706, U = qAm/km\n\n(I - T/B) = .00706 then (nx)3 = (ly)3 = 2.88 x 10-2. Thus for an re of\n\n2.5 mm, the exit aperture is a square, 0.144 mm on a side.\n\nFurther, we recall that\n\nV\n\nVac\n\nV\n\nixiy\n\nV\n\n1\nsin ax sin y\n\n=\n\nMxM\n\n2.\nCalculating again from (63) and the above values (yx)3 = (Yy)3 - 2.3 x 10-\n\nFor V1 = Vac = 208 V and V. = 0.208 V, then sin ax = sin ay = 2.3 x 10-2\n(a-= 1.3\') and\n1\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\ng=\n\n= -R 0.727.\n\n\nR\n\nx\n\ny\n\n\nThus a small magnification of 1.37 is\n\nrequired between the ion "cathode"\n\n(the ionizing region) and the source exit slit. If we demagnify the exit\n\ndimensions, we find that ions need only be drawn from an area\nA =2\n=8 2\nM\n1.095 x 10\n(0.105 mm)\n2\n(A3\nin the ionizing region.\n\nIn fact, of course, the first ion source aperture is made larger to\n\nassure uniform focusing properties in the center of this lens. In addition\n\nthe focusing model assumed an imaging ion source (see Appendix 1). For the\n\nmore commonly used thermal-imaging source a larger first aperture would be\n\nused to focus the center of the thermal image into the exit aperture.\n\nWe have, so far, found that\n\n\nac\n\nr\na\n\n\nv\n\n4V\n\no\n\n(nx)(ny) X) (yy)\n\nA0\n\n\nwhere A o is defined as the area in the ionizing region from which ions are\n\ndrawn to achieve the optimized transmission.

However, since the\n\nphysical meaning is clear in (66) and (67) we retain them and turn to an\n\nexamination of their first terms. Looking at the definitions ff (61) we\n\nsee that none of the coefficients in KI can have much leverage or sensi\xc2\xad\ntivity. The ivX/W product sets the nonlinearity vs density to be accepted\nand cannot be increased greatly without reaching space-charge\'affected ion\nflow. Operation is also generally near maximum cross section, Q., by choice\nof V e. a has only small leverage.\nIn K2 now, we find that the election beam thickness, t, can have a sub\xc2\xad\nstantial leverage on sensitivity. Further, the ion mass appears. The same\n\nis true on K2 . We therefore isolate t and separate M and m% in the constants.\n\nSince M appears in several places it is best to note their differences\nnow. ZQmMI/2 appears in the denominator of K1. This reflects the total\nion space charge summed over the spectrum while M1/2 reflects the velocity\nin moving toward the accelerator electrode. If we had traces of various\ngases, to say 100 AMU, in air the bulk of the charge could still reside in\nthe low mass region and ZQmMM/2 would remain constant. This is the\nassumption that is carried through the remainder of the discussion. M also\n\nThis pertains to the\n\nappears in Equation (51) for VR and in K2 and X\nview (being scanned) as it moves in the repeller-accelerator field.\nmass in\nLater on we will substitute for Vac and find M describing the mass in view\nin the quadrupole. The latter two are thus the same.\nK, appears to have leverage by making a approach 1. While having the\nelectron beam close to the repeller increases its capacity to the sur\xc2\xad\nroundings and thereby reduces the space charge depression, it also leads to\npractical problems of bombarding the repeller. It is felt that in practice,\nonly limited improvement can be obtained here.\n\n31\n\nThe constants are now calculated assuming the following values for\n\nillustration:\n\n4 x 10 - 3 amps/volt meter\n\ni/\n\n=\n\nX\n\nApproximately 5%\n\n=0.6\n\nnonlinearity in I vs\n\nThat an X2 sample is used having\n\n2\n\n\n-20\nmeter\n\nQ28 \' 1.8 x 10\n\n2\n\n-\n\nQ14 - 0.9 x 10\n20 meter\n\n\nQ\n\n1/\n1.8 x 10- 20 (28) 2 + 0.9 x 10\n\nM/2\n\n0.5\n\n\na\n\n=\n\nVa\n\n= 90 volts\n\n\nd\n\n)1\n=\n\n/c =\nKI\n\nK2\n\n3-/\n\nma 1/2\n\n( a \n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n- /2\n\n=\n\n- 3 (volt)\n\n3.49 x 0\n\n3\n2.5 x 10-\n meter\n\n8\n28 x 1.035 x 10-\n kg/coul.\n\n\n8.8 x 10 -\n\n7\n\namp/volt 3/2 meter\n\n= 1.87 x 10- 10 t- 3 /2\n\'1-242\n\n4\n\nM3/2 volt 3/ 2 see2/meter\n\nK1\n\n= 1.8 x 10\n\nK\n\n3\n\n= 5.19 x 10- 9 t-I M volt sec2/meter\n\nKIK 2 =\n1\n\nf\n\nKIK2 =\n\n32\n\n(14)1/2\n\n12.9 x 10-2 0 meter 2 (AMU)I/ 2\n\nM =1\n\nThus,\n\n20\n\namp meter2/volt\n\n\n3/2 M3 /2 amp sec2/meter 5\n1.65 x 10- 20 t-\n\n\n9.28 x 10\n\n-33\n\nt\n\n-l\n\n2\nM amp sec2/meter\n\ns\n\n\ne\n10- (65).

Looking for an\nexplanation, it is apparent that the A. values will be nearly the same since\ntheir optimized components are about equal. However, the arbitrary choice\nof ns for the open source should have provided ample difference in\n\n.F"\n\nIf we break Jinto\n\nF\n\n\nJF\n\nm w\n\nns\n\nwe find that the distinguishing difference between the two modes is that\n\nthe open source (Modes I and 2) has a high electron beam density but a low\n\nparticle density. The reverse is true for the closed source.\n\n\n33\n\nFrom (57),\n\n(I-/w)1,2 = 0.459 a/m = 459 pa/mm,\n\n(70)\n\n\nand by arbitrary choice above,\n\n= 2.42 x 1018/meter 3 .\n\n(ns)l, 2\n\n(71)\n\n\nWhereas from (47), (51) and (63)\n\n(I-)\nw3\n\n\n= 0.0667 a/m= 66.7\n\na/mm\n\n(72\n\n\nand from (48, (51) and (63),\n\n(a)3 - 0.6 nc = 0.6 x 3.32 x 1019 = 2.0 x lo9/m3\n\n(73)\n\n\nSo it appears that a trade off of extremes resulted from the choices\n\nmade. If we examine the practical validity of these choices, the current\n\ndensity of (70) probably cannot be conducted 9 through a small isolating,\n\nrectangular slit if that is a requirement. Without setting up a whole new\n\nparametric system it is assumed that approximately 200 wa/mm could be used\n\nin practice if the passage length did not exceed 1 mm. Even this large\n\nvalue does point up that considerable sensitivity is to be gained by higher\n\nelectron currents than the 10 - 40 pa range typically used. Sensitivities\n\nare therefore reduced by 200/459. Thus the revised values are:\n\n(,-/w) 1 , 2 = 0.200 a/m,\n(f)12\n\n= 1.5 x\n\n(70R)\n(69R\n\namps,\n2\n\n\n3\n-\n\n(J+)I,2 \n = 8.8 x 10 amp/meter\n\n\n2-i\n\n\n,t,0-33-\n\nIK\n\n=\n\n4.03 x 10\n\ndK 0.435 \n\n1\n\n(-\n\nt\n\namp sec2/meter\n\n,\n\ne \n 2 e V(61R)\na) \n\n\n(61R)\n\n\nThe density in Modes 1 and 2 of 2.42 x 10 18/m 3 can probably be sus\xc2\xad\ntained without serious nonlinearity; however, it is not practical to say\n\nfor sure without an actual test.\n\n\n34\n\nNow for the density in Mode 3. If a closed ion source is operated at\n\n4\nthe density of (73), corresponding to 8.3 x 10-\n torr at 400\'k, the gas flow\n\nfrom an ion source of 50 cc/sec speed would be 4.14 x 10-2 torr cc/sec.\n\nThis then, would produce a pressure of 4 x 10- 6 torr in a 10 liter/sec ion\n\npump.\nWithout again optimizing an undefined task, it would seem that this\n\nsample flow and the resulting constraint is unrealistic for a small space\xc2\xad\nborne instrument. The limiting density is therefore arbitrarily reduced by\n\na factor of 4.0 to\n\n(n)3 = 0.15 n. = 5 x 1018/M\nby making X\n\n=\n\nK1\nKIK\n\n3\n\n(73R)\n\n\n0.15 and thus\n= 2.2 x 10- 7 amp\n\n2 \n=\n\n5\n\n3/\n-2\n4.12 x 10 1 t- 3 /2 M 2 amp sec2/meter\n\n(12)3 = 6.52 x 10\n\namps\n\n(68R)\n\n\nand\n\n\n(4I) 3 =\n\n5.95 x 10O\n\namp/meter2\n\n\nIn principle it is possible to increase iv if X is decreased in order\n\nto maintain the same space charge and nonlinearity. However this requires\n\nan experimental maneuver since the theory does not provide the means of\n\nmaking the translation from one to the other. In addition, other options\n\nof increasing electron current density from 66.7 pa/mm while maintaining\n\nlow ion source pumping speed or of enclosing the filament are involved.\n\nSince this additional complexity is not warranted here, the revised values\n\n\nare used as attainable numbers for illustrative purposes.\n\nThe net result of these alternatives is to make the closed and open\n\nion sources look more nearly alike in their operating levels. The fact\n\nremains, of course, that the size of the tube or leak to the environment\n\nis greatly different resulting in different source time constants. Because\n\nof the similarity of end results, however, only the open source modes are\n\nplotted; remembering also that for this source a larger electron density\n\nthan typical is required to make the ion current values attainable.\n\n\n35\n\nParametric Performance Curves\n\nUsing the Mode 1 and 2 equations with the revisions discussed above,\n\nwe proceed to plot the collectable ion current as a function of the various\n\nparameters.\n\nRetaining the variable elements of (64) we recall that\n\n(f)\n\nMV\n\n1+ (max), 2\n\nac\nV.\n-t\n\nr\n\n0\n\n)k\n\n(qm\n\n(\n\n-\n\nm\n\n\nT/B) +.00378) 4 .\n\n(74)\n\nIn order to reduce the number of variables we let M = Nm and express\n\nthe quadrupole equation as\n\n2\nV ac = K Mm r0 f2\nv\n\n(75)\n\nwhere\n\nKv\n\n=\n\n\xc2\xad8\n7.2 x 10\n\nM\n\n=\n\nmaximum mass to be scanned (AMU)\n\nf\n\n=\n\nfrequency (Hz)\n\n\nand substitute in (74) to obtain\n\n2\n4\nf 4 912 r M\n\nT\n\nom\n\ni+\nc (max)02 a8\n\n.\n\n\xc2\xb0 \n\n\n(1 - 2L + .00378\n\n4\n\n(76)\n\nSince power is also an important function we let\n\n2\n2\n2 V\n\npI?\n\nG3 C\n\nae\n\nQ\n\nq\n\n=K\n\nV 2 fZ\n\n(77)\n\np ac\n\nwhere Cq is the quadrupole rod capacity (farads) which is assumed to scale\n\nlinearly with Z by neglecting end and fixed capacities. Q is the circuit\nquality characteristic where it is assumed that by clever design Q can be\n\nheld constant. While neither of these assumptions is valid in practice,\n\nthe added complexity for a more complete description is beyond the scope of\n\nthis discussion.\n\n\n36\n\nIt is further an important simplification that we let k be propor\xc2\xad\ntional to ro for most of the description. To do otherwise is to invite a\n\nlengthly chain reaction influencing the axial velocity and the repeller\n\nvoltage where such is not necessary.

Thus the valley between the peaks is essen\xc2\xad\ntially filled yet the full top width is available for value determination.\n\nWhen this condition is reached, i.e., having an appearance lying between\n\nFigure 4a and 4b, then\n\nqAm\n\nm\n\nB\n\n1\n\n=\n\n=\n\n+\n\nAqB\n\nk m\n\nqm\n\nAqT\n\n1\n\nAq\n\n1l+T)\n\n,or\n\n+ T\n\n(1-\n\nand\n\nsince\n\nfrom (14),\n\n\nm\n\n\nmk\n\ni\n\n1\n\n.\n\n+\n\n(82)\n\nT\n(83)\n\n.()\n\nU\n+ T\n\n0.5 m \n\n\nSubstituting (81), (79) becomes\n\nf4 r6\nI+ (max) a\n\nM22q( \n\n\n1B4\n\n+ .0037\n\nm\n\nWe now let:\n\nx 10 4lz\n\n=\n\n1.016\n\nr\n\n=\n\nvariable\n\n\nM\n\n=\n\nparameter\n\nt\n\n=\n\n5 x 10- 4\n\nV\n\n=\n\n0.208 V\n\n=\n\n10 -\n\nfr\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\ne\n\nTIB =\nand\n\nV a\nac\n\n38\n\n5\n\n\n0.5\nM.\nm\n\n\nm\n\nC\n\n25, 50, 100, 200 AMU\n\n=\n\nC\n=\n\n=\n\nC\n\n(84)\n\nThus power scales as Vac or \n .\n\nAt rO = .00254 m and Mm = 50, Vac = 208 V, P = Po and I /w = 200 pa/mm,\n\n\nI +\nmax)\n\n\n1.74 x 10 10amps\n\n\nAgain sensitivities for both I/w = 200 pa/mm and 20 pa/mm are plotted\n\nvs ro in Figure 7.\n\nIt can be noted that the sensitivity does not fall off rapidly at\n\nMm = 100 and in fact recovers slightly in going to Mm = 200. This is the\n\neffect of the constant .00378 (associated with U) in combination with\n\nincreasing Vac. This does not seem normal or logical and probably indi\xc2\xad\ncates that the narrowed peak width is within 0.lAq of the theoretical\n\nboundary at a resolution of 100 and that the data in this range should not\n\nbe used.\n\nAdditional study of the tail equation will have to be done before this\n\ncan be clarified. The next curve shows this even more strongly.\n\nSensitivity vs Mass and Resolution.- This set of conditions is the\n\nsame as in the preceding paragraphs; however, the role of Mm and ro are\n\nreversed. Figure 8 shows N 2 sensitivity vs Mm with ro as a parameter.\n\nVac is scanned to cover the mass range to M. while holding unit resolution\n\nas defined above.\n\nro\n\n=\n\n1.27, 2.54, 5.08 and 10.16 mm and I-/w\n\n= 20 va/mm.\n\n\nIt is apparent in looking at Figure 8 that the equations in their\n\npresent form should be used at M < 100.\n\nConstant Size, Constant Power Stepping.- If we now wish to cover a wide\n\nmass spectrum by stepping mass range on a given instrument, several ap\xc2\xad\nproaches are possible. In each case Vac is scanned within the range and\n\nonly the locus of sensitivity values at the top of the ranges (Vac (max))\n\nis shown.\n\nOne approach yields constant power by letting Vac (max) = constant and\n\nadding external capacity to hold f\xc2\xa3Mm = constant.

This reduces somewhat the steep fall-off in sensitivity\n\n/ 2\n\nN2 /N ,\n1 and f a (LC)1\nwith mass.

The sensitivity is also plotted in\n\nFigure 9, using S = 1.74 x 10 - 7 a/torr at Mm = 50 and I /w = 20 Pa/mm.\nt, V and 8 are constant as above.\no\n\nIt is clear that without increasing size or by applying considerable\n\npower, sensitivity drops steeply with the maximum mass to be scanned in a\n\ngiven range (or conversely increasing with lower mass). Only by techniques\n\nsuch as scanning Vac directly with M for the full range can the sensitivity\n\nbe maintained.\n\nOne thing that should be remembered is whenever resolution, Am/rn\n\n\nis changed in\n\nmm\n\n1\n\n-\n\n+ .0037\n\n4\n\nthat this implies a change in ri,\n\n2\n\\m M\n)8\n/\ny and v. from the appropriate transforms. y automatically changes if Vac is\nthe independent variable to cause Am/m to vary. vz is partially corrected\n\n40\n\n\nas the mass in view changes, since v, = (2et VR/dm)\n1\n\n=\n\nVE\n\n=\n\nand also\n\n(ft) (U + .00378)\n\n.088 1\n\n.048\n\nThus some compensation is made as m and U change but not by the same degree.\n\nThis residual Vz,plus p then must be changed by some electrical or mechani\xc2\xad\ncal alteration in the system in order to achieve the sensitivities shown.\n\nOne possible means to automatically reach the resolutions called for is to\n\ndecrease VR as mass increases.\n\nEffect of Length and Electron Beam Thickness on Crosstalk.- If we look\n\nat the effect of length and electron beam thickness on crosstalk, the first\n\nstep is to hold the sensitivity constant. By also letting f, ro, Mm, Vo,\n\nAm/m, k. and T/B be constant and reconstructing Z= kro, which contributed\n\nro to the equation,\n\nthen\n\n=\n\nconstant\n\n(88)\n\n\nt (in .04 8)2\nFor values of t = 5 x 10-4m, \xc2\xa3 = 0.1 m and 8\n\ne = 0.048 exp\n\n-\n\n(\xc2\xa3/(kt)l/2)\n\n=\n\n10-5 ; k = 0.279 and\n(89)\n\n.\n\nFigure 10 express, 0 as a function of Z with t as a parameter.\n\nIt is apparent that the effort to reduce t is well worth while if the\n\nlength is an important physical constraint.\n\nOpen Ion Source, Mode l.- For the focusing of energetic particles as\n\nis implied by the use of an open ion source it is necessary to accept ener\xc2\xad\ngies eVo that are substantial. The scaling of a system to accommodate\n\nenergies of the order of 10 ev can be readily done with the optimization\n\nequation expressed in its present form. The principle impact on design is\n\nnot only that system will be larger but that an ion source having a different\n\ncharacter of focusing is needed, i.e., a true imaging lens system as des\xc2\xad\ncribed in Appendix 1. The present equations describe this type of source.\n\n+\n\nSeveral scaling factors are simple to show if we plot Ic vs r0 with Vo\n\nas a parameter. For instance, we can hold power constant (at Mm constant)\n\ngiving I +\n5\n\nro/Vo.\n\nOr we can let f = constant to yield I c a ri\n\nP a rof, greatly expanding the power consumption.\n\nwhereby\n\nA compromise might be\n\n\n41\n\n2\nf2 =\n\nin which P a r\n\nk/r\n\n(i.e., f2r\n\n4\n\n3+\nf and Ic a ro/V o . We choose power constant\n\n\n= constant) since it is quite a safe assumption although in\n\n\npractice one would probably shade this with some increase in power.\nif we let Vo = 1/2\nAm/m\n\n=\n\nvv/e where v. is the vehicle velocity, and maintain\n\n\n1/Mm, T/B = .05 and km\n\n=\n\nVo\n\n(90)\n\n\n+ .00378\n\n(T.

For the 100% transmission portion\n\nof the peak, it was sufficient to describe the extreme particle as defining\n\nthe top edge of the peak. Since the tail has been shown to be a function\n\nthat continues to infinity, it is necessary to define the tail function be\xc2\xad\nfore a selection of a reasonable cut-off point can be made.\n\nThe purpose here is to obtain a relatively simple analytical expression for\n\nthe tail as a function of Aqt away from the peak in order to handle this\n\nfunction in the optimization procedure. Computed data is used to elucidate\n\na function that is then matched to experimentally measured peak tails.\n\nRather than following a rigorous and ambiguous mathematical derivation, it\n\nis further the purpose to gain some physical insight into the unstable par\xc2\xad\nticle behavior.\n\nWe start by replotting a limited amount of computed data from the Mask Study.\n\nFigures 19 and 20 show the log of normalized particle amplitude, A = y/ro as\n\na function of number of cycles of travel in the quadrupole. Only the enve\xc2\xad\nlope of motion is shown. Phase of particle entry, 4o, and fractional\n\ndistance, Aqt/Aq from the theoretical peak edge are used as parameters as\n\nwell as fly and yy. The data available allow the plotting of y-axis motion.\n\nAn interesting result is found in that after sufficient travel, motion ap\xc2\xad\nproximates exponential growth versus the number of cycles, n. It is seen\n\nthat near entry the motion envelope is non-exponential. It is also observed\n\nthat as Aqt/Aq approaches zero (near the theoretical boundary) the motion\n\nfalls away from the positive exponential growth. This, of course, is to be\n\nexpected since a continuous function must describe the transition from un\xc2\xad\nstable growth to stable, bounded motion. The end function used here will\n\nthen be limited in its applicability to Aqt/Aq = 0.1, i.e., 10% outside of\nthe theoretical boundary.\nWe are basically interested in the number of cycles taken for the particle\n\nto reach the characteristic radius, ro, as a function of the initial con\xc2\xad\nditions. For the purposds here the details of motion at small radius or\n\nnear entry are of no interest if we can properly describe the motion as the\n\nparticle assumes a final function.\n\n\n61\n\nConsequently, we note from Figure 19 and 20 that:\n\na. \t The slope of the positive exponential depends upon\n\nAqt/Aq.\n\nb. \t The intercept with n = o depends upon\nc. \t Amplitude is proportional to\nMask Study).\n\nT,\n\no and n and y.\n\nand y when taken separately (see\n\nPlacing the observations of the steady-state function in mathematical\n\nnotation\n\n\nin\n\nA \t= an + f (rj,y, 4o) + f(Aqt/Aq)\n\nWe can either leave f (n,y,o) in its present position or combine it with A.\nSince we wish to separate the variables and rj and y control A linearly, we\nchoose to place it in the form\n\n\nin\n\n= an + f(Aq /A q )\nA\nt\n\nf(n ,Q4) \t\n0\n\nFitted empirically to the group of curves of f = .0025, we find,\n\nA = f(rI,y,\n\n49\n\nap [(.043 + .121 (Aqt/Aq)) n -1.1 (Aqt/Aq)]I\n\n(21\n\nThus Aqt/Aq not only controls the slope versus n but also the intercept and\n\nthe interesting crossover.\n\nSince the function of\nparticles, we let\nfn,y4o)\n\n=\n\nTI,\n\ny, and 4o appears to be of similar form to stable\n\n(FBYy + F 2ny)\n\n(A2-2)\n\n\nor\nA = (Fi y + F 2 ny) exp [(.043 + .121 (Aqt/Aq) n -1.1 Aqt/Aq\nI\n\n(A2-3)\n\nt\n\nalone.

Because\n\nof the similarity of shape (except for magnitude) between x and y tails we\n\nassume the same form of equation for both.\n\nAt this point, we would normally integrate and average over a range of n in\n\norder to obtain the effect of the various z velocities from the ion source.\n\nHowever, this leads to a more complex expression and becomes unwieldly in\n\noptimizing the instrument performance. The net result of this exercise is\n\nto demonstrate that nearly all of the transmitted particles are strongly\n\nweighted to come from the highest velocity group. We therefore assume that\n\nthe ions arise from a thin plane in the ionizing region that is located\n\nvery close to the position giving maximum velocity (vz). The simplified\n\nequation (A2-20) then applies.\n\nWe further ignore the mild dependence of Qmax on (r) and (y) because of the\n\nvery small leverage exerted on the equation compared to the many orders of\n\nmagnitude in a range that we will consider for e. This would otherwise\n\nlead only to a very complex result with 11 and y in both proportional and\nlogarithmic form.\n\nWe thus take the equation of (A2-20) and fit it to the experimental peak\n\nshape shown in Figure 21. This peak on a logarithmic recording appears to\n\ndemonstrate a classical form of the quadrupole peak shape with the relative\n\nmagnitudes of x and y tail clearly shown.

Increasing either of\n\nthese parameters allows an increase in axial velocity without infringing\n\nthe resolution or peak shape. The velocity increase is brought about by\n\nincrease in the repeller-accelerator voltage which allows a faster rate of\n\ncharge formations in the ion source.\n\n\n74\n\nIt would appear from the optimized equation that the resolution could\n\napproach infinity (U 4 0) and still allow a finite current to be collected\n\nbecause of the constant, .00378. In practice, of course, this could not\n\nbe true. In applying (A3-22) the resolution cannot be extended too greatly\n\nbecause of the restriction that the base width include a Aqt of at least\n\n.000706.
