The temporary bonding system requires a test block on which the gages are temporarily bonded, several thermocouples for monitoring temperature, and a data acquisition system for recording apparent strain data. Initially, a group of strain gages are attached to the test block using a bonding agent that disintegrates at high temperatures. The gages are then wired to an appropriate data acquisition and data, collected throughout a predetermined temperature excursion. Once the data is obtained, the test block is heated until the bonding agent disintegrates freeing the gages from the test block. The gages are then disconnected from the data acquisition system and cleaned, thereby ready for use on transducers.", "title": "Strain gage calibration", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-04T16:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840019950, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Moore, T.
