The questions may take the form of what are the environmental benefits that would result if goals are achieved, what are the consequences for other aviation pollutants, and whether tools exist to evaluate the trade-off. In addition to this documents, presentations will be made at the meeting to illustrate current developing views on these subjects. To facilitate studies on trade-offs among environmental impacts from aviation, one must start with scientific investigations that quantify the impacts. A second step is to select representative metrics with policy relevance so that diverse impacts can be put on the same common scale. The IPCC Special Report on Aviation (IPCC, 1999) serves as an excellent example of the first step. The report was produced by IPCC's Working Group 1, whose mandate is to provide the assessment of the scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change. An example of the second step is Witt et al. (2005), a study commissioned by the Environment DG of the European Commission. Within the context of CAEP, step 1 is aligned with the responsibilities of the Research Focal Points, while step 2 is more related to activities of FESG. These steps are likely to be iterative as proposed policy options will raise new science questions, and new science will expand or limit policy options. Past experiences show that clearly defined policy-related scientific needs will help focus the scientific community to marshal their intellects to provide the needed answers.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United Kingdom", "submissionId": 20080014229, "endDate": "2006-03-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "LTTG Technology Review Meeting", "location": "London", "id": "7e1ceeded4d649538fa1c066b0bcf659", "startDate": "2006-03-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080014229, "id": "18120d902f6a4d8789474c18f0df48c9", "publicationDate": "2006-03-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080014229.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080014229/downloads/20080014229.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080014229/downloads/20080014229.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080014229/downloads/20080014229.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
