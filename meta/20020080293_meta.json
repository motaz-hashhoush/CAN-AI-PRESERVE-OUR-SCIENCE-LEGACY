Based on the RG-350, STC commercialized a product line of Stirling cycle generator sets, known as RemoteGen(TM), with power levels ranging from 10We to 3kWe. Under SBIR agreements with Glenn Research Center, the company refined and extended the capabilities of the RemoteGen convertors. They can provide power in remote locations by efficiently producing electricity from multiple-fuel sources, such as propane, alcohol, gasoline, diesel, coal, solar energy, or wood pellets. Utilizing any fuel source that can create heat, RemoteGen enables the choice of the most appropriate fuel source available. The engines operate without friction, wear, or maintenance. These abilities pave the way for self-powered appliances, such as refrigerators and furnaces. Numerous applications for RemoteGen include quiet, pollution-free generators for RVs and yachts, power for cell phone towers remote from the grid, and off-grid residential power variously using propane, ethanol, and solid biomass fuels. One utility and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are evaluating a solar dish concentrator version with excellent potential for powering remote irrigation pumps.", "title": "Powering the Future", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:02:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080293, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080293, "isbn": "0-16-067542-1", "id": "5aa2b664e8064d398d214034be24da3c", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2002", "publicationDate": "2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080293.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080293/downloads/20020080293.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080293/downloads/20020080293.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080293/downloads/20020080293.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
