Since the lines are directly related to specific physical processes this information is model independent and gives the physical conditions in the objects. At the sensitivities achieved to date, approximately 0.0001 to 0.001 phsq cm. sec for steady sources and approximately 0.01 to 1 ph/sq cm sec for transient sources, lines were detected from the galactic center, gamma-ray bursts and transients, X-ray pulsators, the Crab pulsar and solar flares. Future instruments with a factor of approximately 100 sensitivity improvement will allow detailed spectroscopic study of these classes of objects as well as supernova remnants, active galaxies and the interstellar medium. This sensitivity improvement can be obtained through the use of detector technology already proven in balloon and satellite instruments.", "title": "Spectroscopy in the 10 keV to 10 MeV range", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T18:38:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820018208, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Matteson, J.
