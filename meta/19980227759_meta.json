This guidebook details how to define, operate, and implement a working software process improvement program. It describes the concept of the software process improvement program and its basic organizational components. It then describes the structure, organization, and operation of the software process improvement program, illustrating all these concepts with specific NASA examples. The information presented in the document is derived from the experiences of several NASA software organizations, including the SEL, the SEAL, and the SORCE. Their experiences reflect many of the elements of software process improvement within NASA. This guidebook presents lessons learned in a form usable by anyone considering establishing a software process improvement program within his or her own environment. This guidebook attempts to balance general and detailed information. It provides material general enough to be usable by NASA organizations whose characteristics do not directly match those of the sources of the information and models presented herein. It also keeps the ideas sufficiently close to the sources of the practical experiences that have generated the models and information.", "title": "Software Engineering Program: Software Process Improvement Guidebook", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T22:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19980227759, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980227759, "id": "95624ab2207449609e5bde554adc834b", "publicationDate": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980227759.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980227759/downloads/19980227759.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980227759/downloads/19980227759.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980227759/downloads/19980227759.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
