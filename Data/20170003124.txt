However, cost estimates for exploring\nEuropa have been prohibitively expensive, with estimates of a NASA Flagship class orbiter and\nlander approaching $5B. ExoTerra\xe2\x80\x99s NIMPH offers an affordable solution that can not only\nland, but return a sample from the surface to Earth. NIMPH combines solar electric propulsion\n(SEP) technologies being developed for the asteroid redirect mission and microsatellite\nelectronics to reduce the cost of a full sample return mission below $500M.\nA key to achieving this order-of-magnitude cost reduction is minimizing the initial mass of the\nsystem. The cost of any mission is directly proportional to its mass. By keeping the mission\nwithin the constraints of an Atlas V 551 launch vehicle versus an SLS, we can significantly\nreduce launch costs. To achieve this we reduce the landed mass of the sample return lander,\nwhich is the largest multiplier of mission mass, and shrink propellant mass through highefficiency SEP and gravity assists.\nThe NIMPH project\xe2\x80\x99s first step in reducing landed mass focuses on development of a micro-In\nSitu Resource Utilization (\xce\xbcISRU) system. ISRU allows us to minimize landed mass of a sample\nreturn mission by converting local ice into propellants. The project reduces the ISRU system to\na CubeSat-scale package that weighs just 1.74 kg and consumes just 242 W of power. We\nestimate that use of this ISRU vs. an identical micro-lander without ISRU reduces fuel mass by\n45 kg. As the dry mass of the lander grows for larger missions, these savings scale\nexponentially.\nTaking full advantage of the \xce\xbcISRU system requires the development of a micro LOx/LH2\nengine. The micro-LOx-LH2 engine is tailored for the mission by scaling it to match the scale\nof the micro-lander and the low gravity of the target moon. We also tailor the engine for a nearstoichiometric mixture ratio of 7.5. Most high-performance LOx/LH2 engines inject extra LH2 to\nlower the average molecular weight of the exhaust, which improves Isp. However, this extra\nLH2 requires additional power and processing time on the surface for the ISRU to create. This\nincreases mission cost, and on missions within high radiation environments such as Europa,\nincreases radiation shielding mass. The resulting engine weighs just 1.36 kg and produces 71.5\nN of thrust at 364 s Isp.\nFinally, the mission reduces landed mass by taking advantage of the SEP module\xe2\x80\x99s solar power\nto beam energy to the surface using a collimated laser. This allows us to replace an ~45 kg\nMMRTG with a 2.5 kg resonant array.\nBy using the combination of \xce\xbcISRU, a \xce\xbcLOx/LH2 engine, and beamed power, we reduce the\ninitial mass of the lander to just 51.5 kg. When combined with an SEP module to ferry the\nlander to Europa the initial mission mass is just 6397 kg - low enough to be placed on an Earth\nescape trajectory using an Atlas V 551 launch vehicle. By comparison, we estimate a duplicate\nlander using an MMRTG and semi-storable propellants such as LOx/methane would result in an\norder of magnitude increase in initial lander mass to 445 kg. Attempting to perform the\ntrajectory with a 450 s LOx/LH2 engine would increase initial mass to ~135,000 kg. Using an\nAtlas V $/kg rate to Earth escape value of $27.7k/kg, just the launch savings are over $3.5B.\n\n2.0 SYSTEM DESIGN\n2.1 MISSION OVERVIEW\nThe Nano-Icy Moons Propellant Harvester (NIMPH) project focuses on the development of a\nmission architecture which enables a Europa sample return while drastically reducing the cost\nversus traditional orbiter/lander architectures. After Earth and Mars, the liquid oceans beneath\nEuropa\xe2\x80\x99s icy surface are arguably the most likely spot in the solar system to find life. Returning\na sample from Europa will give scientists an opportunity to study the raw materials for signs of\nbiological activity in ways a sensor operating remotely cannot match.\nTraditionally, the cost of a mission is directly proportional to the initial mass of the satellite.\nInitial mass directly impacts the energy, and thus cost, needed to propel the satellite away from\nEarth. This cost often increases as a step function - as mass growth drives a mission from the\ncapabilities of one launch vehicle to another, the cost steps with launch vehicle. For instance,\nlarge cost increases incur in a move from a Falcon 9 to an Atlas V to an SLS. The large Europa\nClipper mission is currently scheduled to fly on an SLS1, which is estimated to cost $1B2 per\nlaunch. A key to reducing mission cost by an order of magnitude is stepping the mission down\nfrom SLS to a $180M Atlas V 5513. Based on the Atlas User\xe2\x80\x99s Guide we must keep the initial\nmission mass below 6500 kg to enable a launch to Earth escape.\nWhile we could launch into Earth orbit and spiral out, we select Earth escape to avoid the\noperations, radiation exposure, eclipse cycling and time associated with the spiral out from Earth\nwith our SEP system. As shown in Figure 2-1, to reduce propellant and development costs, we\nreuse a high efficiency solar electric propulsion (SEP) module being developed for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nAsteroid Redirect Mission. ExoTerra was one of 4 teams commissioned by NASA to study\n\nFigure 2-1: Design Reference Mission - ExoTerra\xe2\x80\x99s DRM Accomplishes a Europa Sample Return at\n10% of Current Cost Estimates of the Europa Clipper\n\nusing commercial systems to perform the Asteroid Redirect Mission and to develop a conceptual\nARM spacecraft design. ExoTerra\xe2\x80\x99s concept provided 57 kW of power at beginning of life\n(BOL) and had up to 3600 kg of xenon capacity. Hall thruster Isp reached 3150 s for transport of\nthe asteroid. Initial dry mass (excluding the asteroid capture mechanism) was 2370 kg. In order\nto support potential commercial uses, ExoTerra\xe2\x80\x99s concept was also designed to be both modular\nand reusable, minimizing the cost of engineering and manufacturing for later missions. The SEP\nmodule connected to an externally mounted tank for refueling on one end, while the payload\nsegment on the other end could be swapped out for different missions using a docking adapter.\nNASA implemented the modular concept into their eventual RFP, though the extent of the\nadoption will depend on the vendor ultimately selected. For the sake of the study, we have\nassumed that we will build-to-print a new SEP module for the mission based on the ARM\ndesign. Based on ExoTerra\xe2\x80\x99s ARM study, recurring cost for the 2nd module is <$170M.\nThe mission uses the SEP system to transfer from Earth to Jupiter orbit insertion and for the\nJupiter to Earth return segments. Based on initial trajectory analysis (detailed in Section 2.2), 6.7\nkm/s of \xce\x94V is required to transit from Earth to Jupiter and an additional 9.2 km/s are allocated\nfor return. The analysis assumes a series of gravity assists to minimize the \xce\x94V.\nWhile in the Jovian system there is insufficient sunlight to drive the EP system at full power.\nInstead we carry along a 350 s LOx/Methane stage for performing maneuvers within the Jovian\nsystem, and for Europa orbit insertion and departure. The total amount of \xce\x94V required is a\nfunction of launch date and the location of the various moons at the time of arrival. Our\ntrajectory analysis has shown we can reduce the \xce\x94V within the Jovian system for flybys, Europa\ninsertion, maintenance and departure to as low as 674 m/s using gravity assists. Given the\nuncertainty in launch date, we allocated a total of 1250 m/s for adjusting trajectory within the\nsystem for gravity assists from the Jovian moons. Total mass of the stage is 1991 kg.\nWhile operating within the high radiation environment of Jupiter and its moons, we minimize\ntotal ionizing dose on the lander\xe2\x80\x99s electronics by storing it within a vault on the SEP module. To\neliminate boiloff of lander propellants on the outward journey the LOx and LH2 required for\nlanding is stored as water. This water is converted to LOx/LH2 prior to deployment of the lander\nat Europa, using a duplicate ISRU system mounted on the SEP module.\nOnce in orbit around Europa, the lander is deployed. To minimize landed mass, we replace the\ntraditional RTG with a laser power beaming system. As discussed in Section 2.3, up to 1800 W\nof power can be beamed to the surface from the orbiter while in Europa orbit, providing up to\n478 W of electrical power to the lander. This replaces the 45 kg RTG power system with a 2.5 kg\narray system, significantly reducing landed mass and avoiding the cost and complexity of using a\nradioisotope power source. We have allocated 50 kg on the orbiter for the laser power-delivery\nsystem.\nDuring landing, we use LIDAR to select an icy surface for landing, ensuring the lander feet will\nbe in direct contact with ice. Once on the surface, the lander collects a 1 kg sample of ice. The\nISRU system then begins to process ice for propellant to return to the orbiter by sublimating the\nice under the landing feet. Total return propellant is 21.95 kg, including a 10% \xce\x94V margin and\n5% unused propellant margin. The ISRU system operates during \xe2\x80\x9claser daylight\xe2\x80\x9d, i.e.: while the\norbiter is in view of the lander. Water is processed at rate of 8.3 mg/s; 242 W is required to\nsublimate and electrolyze the water and then liquefy the propellants. This results in a total\nsurface time for the mission of 148 days. Total wet mass of the lander is 52.5 kg when deployed.\n\nTable 2-1: System Mass Summary\nItem\n\nMass (kg)\n\nSEP Module Dry Mass\n\n2371.0\n\nCollimated Laser System\n\n50.0\n\nMisc Orbiter Sensor Payload\n\n25.0\n\nLander Canister\n\n5.0\n\nSample Return Capsule\n\n6.2\n\nLander\n\n52.5\n\nLOx/Methane Stage\n\n1991.6\n\nXenon Propellant\n\n2131.4\n\nTotal\n\n6396.8\n\nThe landing legs are left behind at liftoff, as\nwe assume the foot pads will have become\nbound to the ice as a result of the water\ncollection process.\nLander mass is further minimized by\nleaving off rendezvous systems. After the\nlander reaches orbit, the SEP module will\nrendezvous with and then capture the noncooperative lander. The SEP module then\nleaves the Jovian system and returns the\nsample to Earth, where the lander is\ndelivered to Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface inside a\nminiaturized\nIRVE-derived\ninflatable\nreentry capsule.\nWe estimate that the\ncapsule weighs approximately 20% of the\ndry lander, or 6.2 kg.\n\nAllowing for 25 kg of additional scientific payload instruments on the orbiter gives a total orbiter\ndry mass of 2487.3 kg. Using the SEP system for 6.7 km/s to and 9.2 km/s from Jupiter and the\nLOx/Methane system for 1250 m/s within the Jupiter system, we arrive at a total initial mass of\n6446 kg.\n\n2.2 TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS\nSolar Electric Propulsion (SEP) vehicles have a wide range of trajectory solutions for\ninterplanetary missions. The design space is a function of the low thrust, propulsion hardware,\ntime of flight (TOF) requirements, radiation minimization, sunlight exposure, gravity assist\nmaneuvers, and launch date opportunities to name a few. At this stage in the design, we have\ncalculated the following solution as an example demonstrating the feasibility of an interplanetary\ntrajectory with the NIMPH system. This data will be used in future work as a starting point for\n\nFigure 2-2: The MEEJ Gravity Assist sequence allows NIMPH to rendezvous with the Jupiter\nsystem in 6.9 years using 6.7 km/s \xce\x94V from the propulsion system.\n\ntrade studies to determine several optimal solutions within the complex design space.\nBased on the Earth/Jupiter synodic period, there is a direct trajectory from Earth to Jupiter every\n13 months. However, to fit within an Atlas V 551, gravity assists must be used to minimize the\n\xce\x94V that needs to be delivered from the propulsion system. There are many variations on the\nseries of gravity assist paths. Multiple Venus flybys is often studied and may be desirable for a\nSEP system due to its proximity to the sun. But for that very same reason, additional thermal\nprotection systems would be required, adding system weight, so we have opted to not use Venus\nin our initial study. Instead our path will include Mars and Earth only.\nUsing a patched conic approach and NASA\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory design tool, Copernicus, the analysis\nstarts with a launch from an Atlas 551 resulting in a C3 of 31.1 km/s. NIMPH then proceeds on\na Mars-Earth-Earth-Jupiter (MEEJ) path. The first gravity assist we encounter is from Mars 181\ndays after launch. For this solution, only 1.31 km/s were required from the propulsion system to\nachieve the rendezvous with Mars. Once we swing by Mars, a burn using 259 m/s \xce\x94V was\nneeded to continue with two flybys of Earth. After the second flyby of Earth, NIMPH has\ntraveled a total of 4.5 years but now has the required energy to rendezvous with Jupiter. After a\n2.3-year cruise to Jupiter the SEP system performs a 5.13 km/s maneuver for capture in to the\nJupiter system. Figure 2-2 shows the overall path of this trajectory starting from Earth to\nrendezvous with Jupiter.\nNIMPH arrives in the Jupiter system after 6.9 years having used only 6.7 km/s of \xce\x94V from the\npropulsion system. We enter an elliptical orbit at 10.8 km/s and begin flybys of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s moons\nto begin decreasing our velocity for Europa orbit insertion. Figure 2-3 shows several revolutions\naround Callisto, Ganymede and Europa. The flybys give a reduction in \xce\x94V ranging from 640 m/s\nto 1.08 km/s.\nAn important consideration in this phase of the trajectory is the amount of radiation NIMPH is\nexperiencing. Therefore, in this solution, we\ndo not perform flybys of Io to avoid the\nstrong radiation exposure. We have also\nchosen not to include Callisto flybys for this\nexample so as to reduce the flight time\nbefore Europa orbit insertion.\nAfter 745 days including four flybys around\nGanymede and another four flybys around\nEuropa, we have decreased our energy\nenough to only need 261 m/s from the\nLOx/Methane system to perform the orbit\ninsertion maneuver into a 500-km altitude\norbit. Any propulsion \xce\x94V required during\nthe Ganymede and Europa flybys was shown\nto be negligible for this case. We estimate\n113 m/s for orbit maintenance during the\n170 days of lander operations. Once surface\noperations are complete and the lander has\nreturned the ice sample to the SEP spacecraft\n\nFigure 2-3: Multiple Gravity Assists around\nGanymede and Europa result in a 261 m/s EOI.\n\nTable 2-2: Propulsion \xce\x94V and TOF Summary\n\xce\x94V (km/s)\n\nTime (days)\n\nEarth to Mars\n\n1.31\n\n181\n\nPost Mars Flyby\n\n.259\n\n587\n\n~\n\n900\n\n5.13\n\n854\n\n6.7\n\n2522 (6.9y)\n\nGanymede Flyby (x4)\n\n~\n\n304.8\n\nEuropa Flyby (x4)\n\n~\n\n440\n\nEuropa Orbit Insertion\n\n.261\n\n1.5\n\nOrbit Maintenance\n\n.113\n\n170\n\n.3\n\n2.2\n\n.674\n\n918.5\n\n9.2\n\n378\n\n3.4-5.8\n\n>900\n\n9.2\n\nin orbit, we\xe2\x80\x99ll need approximately\n300 m/s to depart Europa and return\nto Jupiter orbit.\n\n378\n\nEarth Departure\n\nEarth to Earth Flyby (x2)\nEarth to Jupiter\nTotal\n\nJovian System\n\nEuropa Orbit Departure\nTotal\n\nEarth Return\nDirect\nGravity Assist Option\nTotal\n\nDeparting Jupiter for a direct return\nto Earth will take the SEP system 9.2\nkm/s and a little over a year. If the\n\xce\x94V budget allows this large of a\nburn, this may be desirable due to the\nscientific importance of the sample.\nHowever, we may need to perform\ngravity assists to return to Earth with\na more reasonable propulsion \xce\x94V\nrequirement. If so, the \xce\x94V\nrequirement could be in the range of\n3.4 \xe2\x80\x93 5.8 km/s for one flyby of either\nMars or Earth and even lower if\nmultiple flybys were chosen.\nHowever, this will increase the time\nof flight by three to four years. Table\n2-2 shows a summary of the \xce\x94V and\nTOF for this data set. We also\nmaintain \xce\x94V margin for any\nadditional deep space maneuvers for\ncorrections due to launch date\nchanges.\n\nThis solution is just one example.\n16.6\n3818.5 (10.5y)\nMission Total\nThe flexibility offered from using a\nlow thrust SEP system may result in\n3.4\nReserve\nmore than one optimal solution for\neach launch date opportunity. As\nstated previously, once a target launch date is set, many trades need to be performed using a\nrange of launch dates to optimize on the large design space while satisfying the constraints of\n\xce\x94V, fuel and mission duration. The trades may include the following:\nGravity Assists - The number of GA\xe2\x80\x99s, and the planet sequence and timing of the maneuvers will\nbe analyzed to minimize the overall time of flight and the time the spacecraft is in shadow while\non the Earth departure and return phase of the mission. While in the Jupiter system, the\nnumerous sequences for moon gravity assists will be considered for both the arrival and\ndeparting phase to optimize the TOF, \xce\x94V requirements and radiation effects and Europa sample\nlocation.\nRadiation Effects - The spacecraft will spend several years within the heavy magnetic field of\nJupiter and minimizing those effects will be necessary to ensure the health of the spacecraft\nsystems. Factors will include timing of the JOI, as well as choosing the optimal sequence during\nthe Jupiter moons flyby phase to avoid the regimes of maximum radiation. Another possible\nconsideration according to Astrobiology Magazine article, \xe2\x80\x98Hiding from Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s Radiation\xe2\x80\x99 at\nastrobio.net, is that the sample site may need to be on the leading hemisphere of Europa in an\n\narea that has been protected from constant irradiation which would kill many organic molecules.\nThese effects may all contribute to the optimal choice for landing site and in turn, the orbit for\nthe SEP spacecraft.\nEuropa\xe2\x80\x99s Orbit Stability \xe2\x80\x93 The stability of the orbit around Europa is a function of the dynamics\nfrom the other Jovian moons as well as Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s large gravitational field. Optimizing the orbit\nfor minimal orbit maintenance maneuvers and/or finding stable manifold within the low Europa\norbit range, will decrease the overall \xce\x94V needed for the propulsion system.\n\n2.3 POWER DELIVERY SYSTEM\nAt Jupiter, we anticipate that 2.03 kW of power will still be available to the orbiter due to the\nlarge arrays. 200 W of power is reserved for the orbiter, leaving 1.83 kW of power to support\nlander operations. To deliver this power from the spacecraft to the ground, we use a collimated\nlaser system. The laser system is based on an nLight diode pumped laser developed under the\nDARPA SHEDs program4. The system starts with a 75% efficient fiber laser. This is then\npumped with an 85% efficient diode laser to reach 1.83 kW. Using optics, the beam is\ncollimated into a .35 m beam waist laser. Assuming a further 10% degradation for losses\nthrough the optics, we see a net conversion of 57.4% of the input electrical power to a 1052 W\noutput beam.\nAssuming a Gaussian beam, divergence of the beam is governed by the Raleigh Range. At a\nwavelength of 1030 nm and beam waist of .35 m, the collimated laser has a Raleigh Range of\n3.74 x 105 km. At an orbit altitude of 500 km, the maximum distance between the satellite and\nlander is 1346 km when the satellite is on the horizon. Due to the high Raleigh Range, we see\nnegligible beam divergence at this distance and the resulting spot size from the laser is .38 m2.\nThe flux at the lander is 2734 W/m2, roughly 2x the flux of sunlight in Earth orbit. This\nconcentrated power allows for a reduction in the size of the solar array on the surface.\nA driving requirement for the system is the pointing accuracy of the laser. Most star trackers\nhave accuracies on the order of 1 arcsecond. This error in attitude knowledge alone results in an\nerror on the ground of 8 m, which could miss the lander altogether. To lock onto the lander we\nrequire a feedback loop. We envision the satellite will perform a scan with the beam as it comes\nover the horizon. Once the array is pinged, the lander sends a signal back to confirm the beam is\non target. From there, the array can sense the position of the beam on the array. Feeding this\ninformation to the spacecraft allows the spacecraft to center the beam on the array. To achieve\nthis fine precision requires a fine resolution on the spacecraft laser gimbal. Current high end\ngimbals such as the Moog ultrafine rotary actuator have a step angle of .001 deg, or 3.6\narcseconds \xe2\x80\x93 which is worse than the attitude knowledge. To further improve the resolution, we\nuse the rotary actuator for coarse pointing and implement a secondary piezo-electric actuator\nalong the edge of the collimated laser. The piezo allows for step sizes as small as 20 nm. At a\nradius of .35 m, we achieve an angular step size of .01 arcseconds, which results in a worst case\nstep on the ground of .077 m. Since the spacecraft and Europa are moving, we must project\nforward where the array will be located when we point the array. We allocate an additional error\nof .01 arcseconds to account for errors in projections between feedback signals. This results in\noversizing the array radius by .153 m to provide some margin for error.\nBecause we use a laser beam with a single frequency, we can tune the photovoltaic cells to\nconvert the energy more efficiently than typical solar power conversion which much convert\nenergy from a wide spectrum. Theoretical efficiencies are as high as 78%5, though we assume a\n\nmore conservative 60% conversion rate. In addition to conversion losses, we assume an\nadditional 24% loss due to packing factor, diode losses, temperature losses, radiation degradation\nand manufacturing imperfections. This results in a total output power of 478 W at the surface.\nCompanies such as LaserMotive have demonstrated receiver specific power of 500 W/kg. 6 As\nanother reference, ATK advertises a 150 W/kg solar array specific power (BOL) for their\nUltraFlex7 arrays that are designed for operation in a gravity field. Adjusting the ATK value for\na flux that is 2x that of solar power in Earth orbit and for 60% conversion efficiency vs. the 30%\nUltraFlex cells results in a specific power of 600 W/kg. Assuming 24% degradation results in\n478 W/kg at Europa. For the actively powered section of the array, we estimate a mass of 1.05\nkg. Since the array is oversized to .8 m2 vs. the .38 m2 requirement to account for pointing\nerrors, total array mass is estimated at 2.18 kg.\n\n2.4 EUROPA ORBIT\nOPTIMIZATION\n\nMass & Surface Time vs. Orbit\nAltitude\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\nInitial Mass (kg)\n\nSurface Time (hr)\n\n65.00\n500\nThe orbit selection for the host satellite\n450\n60.00\nplays a large role in mission optimization.\n400\n55.00\nReducing the orbit altitude reduces the\n350\n300\nInitial Mass (kg)\n50.00\ntotal \xce\x94V needed for the lander, and the\n250\nSurface Time (days)\nresulting propellant that must be produced.\n45.00\n200\n150\nIt also reduces the distance to the lander,\n40.00\n100\nimproving pointing errors and reducing the\n35.00\n50\nsize of the solar arrays. Conversely, a\n30.00\n0\nlower altitude decreases the total fraction\nOrbit Altitude (km)\nof time the satellite is in view of the lander\nto provide power via laser. This increases Figure 2-4: Orbit Altitude Optimization\nthe eclipse time and lander battery mass\nrequired, and increases the time required to process the propellant. A longer time on the surface\nin turn increases the radiation vault mass, and the longer mission duration adds to mission\noperations costs.\n\nCost ($M)\n\nExoTerra has built a system optimization program to evaluate the impact of changing the orbit\naltitude. Our primary goal is to minimize the mission cost. These costs are assumed to be driven\nby the initial mass and operations costs. Figure 2-4 provides the initial mass and surface time as\na function of orbit altitude. Based on the\ncost and performance of the Atlas V 551,\nCost vs. Orbit Altitude\nour target launch vehicle, we find that the\n11.8\n11.6\nlaunch vehicle costs $27.7k/kg to Earth\n11.4\nescape velocity. Assuming we use the\n11.2\n11\nSEP Module, we also find that each kg of\n10.8\ndry mass on the surface results in 6.1 kg\n10.6\n10.4\ngrowth to the mass at Earth escape. This\n10.2\nresults in an incremental cost of $169k/kg\n10\n9.8\non the surface. We have also estimated\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n$7,470/day to operate the mission. These\nOrbit Altitude (km)\nvalues were used with the total surface\ntime and initial mass to estimate the Figure 2-5: Relative Cost vs. Orbit Altitude\n\nmission cost for each orbit altitude. We\nfind the minimum cost point at 400 km\n(see Figure 2-5).\nHowever, since the mission time begins to\ngrow quickly below 500 km, and the cost\ndifference is small between the points, we\nhave elected to use 500 km to keep our\nmission time on the surface shorter. This\nminimizes the amount of time available\nfor Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s law to operate.\nTo calculate the vault mass we assumed\nthat the electronics were manufactured\nFigure 2-6: Radiation Dose v. Shield Thickness\nwith a radiation tolerance of 1 MRad.\nApproximation\nThis is higher than typical cubesat\nelectronics at 30-100 kRad, but within the\nrealm of the industry. We derated the exposure limit to 800 krad to provide 25% margin. In\naddition, we assumed 1 krad of exposure during the journey and 8 krad of exposure during orbit\ncapture maneuvers based on an estimate from M. Podzollo.8\nTo improve vault mass, we assume a combination aluminum/tantalum wall. Based on data from\nQinetiQ9, use of Al/Ta shielding can reduce the total dose by 70-90% vs. straight aluminum.\nThis is accomplished by taking advantage of the different densities to break up the radiation and\nblock the different levels. The fraction varies with the shield thickness. We have conservatively\nestimated a 60% reduction for all thicknesses.\nThe data is roughly linear with the log of the dosage rate. To quickly estimate the required\nthickness as the surface time varied, we developed a curve fit of the Al/Ta estimated dose rate.\nThis curve is also shown in Figure 2-6.\nThe vault is assumed to be 1U in size, resulting in 6 10 cm x 10 cm panels. We multiply this\nsurface area by the required equivalent aluminum thickness to determine the total vault mass. At\n500 km, this is 1.26 kg.\n\n2.5 THRUSTER OPTIMIZATION\n\n395\n\nIsp vs. O:F\n\n390\n\nIsp (s)\n\nThe thruster sizing is integral to the overall\n385\nlander performance. As such, ExoTerra\n380\nintegrated the thruster optimization within\n375\nour system design tool to gauge the impact\n370\nof various variables on the system design.\n365\nKey variables we explored included\n360\nmixture ratio, Throat/Nozzle area ratio,\n355\nand chamber pressure. We used the\n350\nNASA Chemical Equilibrium with\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\nO:F\nApplications (CEA) online tool to generate\n303970, 40\n303970, 60\na database of performance data for the\n405300, 60\n506620, 40\nvarious options. This included varying\nmixture ratio from 4:1 to 8:1, area ratios of Figure 2-7: Isp v. Mixture Ratio\n\n6.5\n\n405300, 40\n506620, 60\n\n7\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\nSurf. Time vs. OF\n5510\n5010\n4510\n\nSurf.

The program\nprovided data on thrust, Isp, fluid densities\nand temperatures that were used to\nevaluate the mission performance.\n\n4010\n\nTo sort the conflicting performance\nvariables, we evaluated each of the\nthruster design points within the system\nmodel to find the optimum design point\nfor the mission. Figure 2-9 provides the\ntotal initial mass versus the O:F ratio. We\nsee there is a local minimum at an O:F\nratio of 7.5 at 506 kPa and a 60 area ratio.\n\nT/W\n\nTotal Mass (kg)\n\n3510\nThe mixture ratio had a direct impact on\n3010\nthe performance of the engine, the mission\n2510\ntime, the lander mass and radiation\nshielding.

Figure 27 shows the decrease in Isp with\n53.00\nincreasing O:F ratio for each of the 6\ncombinations of area ratio and chamber\n52.50\npressure. While higher Isp is desired, this\n52.00\nresults in an increase in the time needed to\nprocess propellant since we need to\n51.50\nprocess extra hydrogen, throwing away the\nassociated oxygen.

Mixture Ratio\nwork.\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\nLastly, we evaluated relative cost vs. O:F ratio for each design point. We estimated the cost of\noperations as $7475/day which covers DSN costs plus a staff of 6 monitoring the satellite 8\nhr/day. The cost of the mass was derived from the launch costs and gear ratio for the system. At\na cost of $180M and capacity of 6500 kg to Earth Escape, we have an incremental cost of\n$27,700 per kg. Based on our model, each kg of dry mass on the surface results in 6.1 kg\nneeded at Earth escape. Thus we estimate each kg on the surface of Europa cost $169,000.\nUsing these rates, we find that the minimum cost is in the 7.5 to 8.0 O:F area of the graph shown\nin Figure 2-11. To maintain a positive T/W ratio, we select the ratio 7.5:1.\n\n3.0 ISRU DESIGN\nThe ISRU system is composed of three branches: water collection, oxygen processing, and\n\nFigure 3-1: ISRU Block Diagram\n\nhydrogen processing. Water harvesting starts with the sublimation of ice to vapor by the heaters\nembedded in each lander foot. The vapor is gathered by a compressor and converted to liquid in\na distilling condenser. The liquid water is fed into the electrolyzer, where it is split into its\nconstituent oxygen and hydrogen.\nFrom there, the oxygen passes through a compressor, a condenser, and an expansion valve,\nwhich convert it to liquid form for storage in the oxidizer tank. Gaseous oxygen from tank\nboiloff and incomplete liquification feeds back into the compressor inlet for further processing.\nHydrogen follows a similar sequence, using additional heat exchangers and a turbine to attain the\nvery low temperatures needed to liquefy the fuel. Figure 3-1 is a block diagram of the system.\n\n3.1 PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nThe NIMPH In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) system harvests water from the surface of\nEuropa and converts it into hydrogen and oxygen propellants. Figure 3-2 shows the arrangement\nof the principal components within the lander. The ISRU system processes 8.27 mg/sec of water\nthrough an electrolyzer, producing 7.35 mg/sec of oxygen and 0.92 mg/sec of hydrogen. The\n\nFigure 3-2: ISRU Water Processing System Layout\n\nestimated mass of the entire system is 1.74 kg,\nwith an estimated power consumption of 242\nW. Table 3-1 provides a summary of the mass\nand power.\n\n3.2 WATER COLLECTION\nThe process for producing water from the icy\nsurface of Europa begins at the feet of the\nlander.\n\nTable 3-1: \xce\xbcISRU Mass & Power Summary\nItem\nInlet\nH2O Compressor\nH2O Distiller\nH2O Pump\nElectrolyzer\nO2 Radiative Cooler\nO2 Compressor\nO2 Condensoer\nO2 Expansion Valve\nH2 Radiative Cooler\nH2 Compressor\nH2 Condenser\nH2 Expansion Valve\nH2 Turbine\nH2 Hx\nTubing\nTotal\n\nMass (g) Power\n(W)\n170\n24.7\n118\n3\n42\n100\n.1\n400\n154\n16\n46\n1.2\n24\n2\n24\n114\n72\n70\n2\n102\n-12.4\n400\n106\n1740\n242.7\n\nThe surface temperature of Europa never rises\nabove 110 K, and the atmospheric pressure is a\nnegligible 0.1 \xc2\xb5Pa (compared to 101.3 kPa on\nEarth). Under such conditions, ice on the\nsurface will not melt into a liquid when heat is\nadded; it will sublimate into a vapor. The\nlander takes advantage of this phase shift by\nembedding heating coils into the bottom of\neach lander foot, as shown in Figure 3-3. These\ncoils heat the surface of the foot, sublimating\nthe ice on which it rests.\nUsing work\n10\nperformed by Andreas regarding sublimation\nof ice in space, we find we can sublimate 8.7\nmg/s by heating the ice to 211.5 K with 24.1 W of power. The ~ 1 Pa vapor passes through holes\nbetween the turns of the heating coils and into the hollow tubular lander leg. We heat the vapor\nto increase the pressure to 1228 Pa using .6 W of power.\nBy harvesting only vapor, the only potential contaminants will be sublimated gases captured with\nthe vapor. All other impurities, such as dirt and rocks, remain on the surface, simplifying our\ncollection and purification system. The heated footpads form tight seals with the surface of\nEuropa as they sublimate ice and smooth the contact surface beneath them, improving\ncompressor performance while minimizing vapor escape to the environment. Because the\nfootpads will end up frozen into the icy surface, the\nlander jettisons the legs at takeoff.\n\nFigure 3-3: Lander Foot Detail\n\nA 3 W, 118 g micro-compressor increases the pressure\nand temperature of the vapor to 10 kPa and 476 K and\nthen passes it on to the condenser shown in Figure 3-4.\nThe condenser uses the cold ambient temperature of\nEuropa to cool the vapor. At 10 kPa and 285 K, the\nwater condenses into a liquid. We then vent any other\ngasses, leaving 8.3 mg/s of water. Since the ambient\ntemperature of Europa is so cold, an insulative material\nis placed between the condenser and the exterior of the\nlander to prevent freezing. Other gases collected from\nthe surface, such as carbon dioxide, will not condense\nand will be vented from the top of the unit. The\ncondenser mass is estimated at 42 g. Liquid water then\n\npasses through a pump to the electrolyzer,\nincreasing pressure to 50 kPa.\n\n3.3 ELECTROLYZER\nAn electrolyzer uses electrical current to\nseparate liquid water into hydrogen and oxygen\ngases. The \xce\xbcISRU uses a Polymer Electrolyte\nMembrane (PEM) electrolyzer, which is\ncompact, lightweight, and works at lower\ntemperatures than those using other electrolysis\nmethods (see Figure 3-5). The electrolyzer\nsplits water into oxygen and hydrogen and\ndraws them to separate sides of the system,\nautomatically separating the gases. From here\nthe gases are delivered to their respective\nliquification loops for further processing.\n\nFigure 3-5: PEM Electrolysis\n\nFigure 3-4: Conceptual Condenser Design\n\nDuring Phase I, the electrolyzer setup was\nprototyped using a commercially available\nsystem, as shown in Figure 3-6. For Ph II,\nExoTerra is developing this component with\nGiner Inc., a leading expert in electrolyzer\ndesign and manufacture in the United States,\nwith experience in space applications of this\ntechnology.\nGiner has demonstrated\nelectrolyzers with 88% efficiency and 1000\nW/kg specific mass. This allows us to decrease\nthe size of the electrolyzer within the bounds of\na CubeSat scale. The total power required to\nelectrolyze the water is 154 W. According to\nthe Giner design, total mass for our application\nis expected to be .4 kg. The electrolyzer has a\ndiameter of 13.5 cm and is 9.2 cm tall,\noccupying just over 1U. As an additional\nbenefit, the design is capable of operating in 0g,\nallowing potential follow-on missions to\nasteroids.\n\n3.4 HEAT EXCHANGERS\nIn the hydrogen loop, heat exchangers transfer heat\nfrom one stage of the process to another in order to\nreach the much lower temperatures required for\nhydrogen liquification. As shown in Figure 3-2, there\nwill be two counterflow heat exchangers: one between\nthe line from the hydrogen turbine and the line to the\nexpansion valve, and the other between the lines to and\n\nFigure 3-6: Electrolyzer Prototype\n\nfrom the hydrogen tank. We\xe2\x80\x99ve estimated the mass of the two heat exchangers at 200 g each.\nDetailed design of the heat exchangers will be performed in Ph II.\n\n3.5 HYDROGEN LIQUEFACTION\nWe calculate that waste heat from the electrolyzer will result in an average output temperature of\n425 K. The LH2 production process begins by cooling the .91 mg/s of gaseous H2 from the\nelectrolyzer using a radiative cooler and the ambient conditions of Europa\xe2\x80\x99s surface to 116 K.\nThe cold gas is combined with 2.21 mg/s of gas vented from the tank and 14.3 mg/s of\nrecirculated flow from the turbine/heat exchanger and sent through a multistage compressor.\nThe micro-compressor increases pressure to 2 MPa and 407 K using 72 W. Initial sizing of the\ncompressor estimates the mass at 46 g.\nThe temperature is then reduced by an inline gas cooler to radiatively cool the fluid to 110 K.\nFrom there the fluid splits between a path to the turbine and to the Joule-Thompson expander.\n82% of the fluid is sent to the turbine where it expands to 50 kPa, cooling to 27 K and providing\n12.4 W of power to help power the compressor. The bypassed fluid passes through a heat\nexchanger to transfer heat to the now 27 K fluid. This drops the bypassed flow to 44 K. While\nthe flow from the turbine line is sent back to the compressor, the bypassed flow passes through\nanother heat exchanger coming up from the tank return at 18 K. This reduces the temperature to\n36 K. Finally, the chilled H2 gas flows through an expansion valve and ~29% liquefies at 18 K\nand 50 kPa. The liquid H2 is collected in the fuel tank. Saturated gas from incomplete\nliquification and tank boiloff is recirculated to the compressor inlet.\nThe resulting design requires custom compressors based on the cryogenic temperatures, low flow\nand high pressure/temp gain. Research and communications with pump manufacturer BarberNichols shows that modification to existing impeller designs is possible to make them suitable\nfor our application. However, purpose-designed positive displacement pumps may more\nefficiently and cost-effectively meet the flow, temperature, and compression ratio conditions in\nthe ISRU system. The detail design of these items will be performed in Ph II.\n\n3.6 OXYGEN LIQUEFACTION\nThe LOx system follows a simpler sequence than the LH2 system due to its higher boiling point.\n7.35 mg/s of gaseous O2 from the electrolyzer is cooled to 116 K using a radiative cooler. The\ncold gas is combined with 2.56 mg/s of gas drawn from the oxidizer tank and then compressed to\n900 kPa and 246 K. The compressor power is 1.2 W and it weighs an estimated 46 g. The gas is\nthen cooled 116 K in a condenser prior to passing through the expansion valve to 50 kPa. 74%\nof the fluid liquefies, and is stored in the oxidizer tank. The remaining gaseous oxygen from\nboiloff and incomplete liquification is recirculated to the compressor.\nBrushless DC motors will be used in both systems to increase reliability and decrease the risk of\nsparking. Compressor startup needs further consideration with both systems due to the recycled\nflow required for nominal operating conditions. Where necessary magnetic couplings, extended\nshafts, and linkages fabricated from composite materials will thermally isolate motors, actuators,\ncontrol electronics, and cryogenic components from each other.\n\n3.7 SYSTEM MONITORING\nThe ISRU process is monitored and regulated using a combination of temperature and pressure\ntransducers, illustrated in Figure 3-7. The pressure of the system is measured using two type of\n\npressure transducers. The first is a\nNOVA Sensor NPC-410 Series Medium\nPressure Sensor, selected for its small\nsize. The temperature range for this\nsensor is -40\xc2\xb0C to 125\xc2\xb0C, which covers\nthe range for the water extraction and\ncondensing portion of the ISRU process.\nThe liquid hydrogen portions of the\nsystem use an OMEGA Thin-Film\nCryogenic Pressure Transducer, with a\ntemperature operating range of -196 to\n149\xc2\xb0C.\n\nFigure 3-7: NOVA Pressure Sensor, OMEGA\n\nUnfortunately, this sensor is much Cryogenic Pressure Transducer, Omega Cryogenic\nbigger than the NOVA sensor. There is Temperature Sensor\nlack of availability of pressure sensors\nthat operate at the low temperatures required to condense hydrogen, especially in a compact\npackage. Even this OMEGA sensor operating range does not reach coldest temperature we are\nexpecting in the ISRU process, -230\xc2\xb0C. Further discussions with pressure transducer companies\nare required to explore the possibilities of pressure sensors that operate at these low\ntemperatures.\nOMEGA Cryogenic Temperature Sensors, with an operating range of -271.7\xc2\xb0C to 226.8\xc2\xb0C (1.4K\nto 500K), measure temperatures throughout the ISRU system.\n\n4.0 PROPULSION DESIGN\nThe NIMPH propulsion system shown in Figure 4-1 is a pump-fed LO2-LH2 design which uses\npropellants produced by the on-board ISRU equipment. During propellant production, shutoff\nvalves isolate the tankage from the propulsion system. Prior to operation, upstream shutoff\n\nFigure 4-1: Propulsion Block Diagram and NIMPH Miniature LH2-LO2 Engine\n\nvalves close to isolate the ISRU fueling system from the tankage, and the isolation valves open\nto allow propellants to flow into the feedlines. Pumps draw in propellants from the feedlines and\ndeliver them downstream at the required pressures and flow rates. To accommodate engine\ngimbaling for thrust vector control, the pumps connect via cryogenic flexlines to control valves\non the engine head. These valves regulate propellant flow to the engine inlets to optimize\ncombustion and throttle the engine as needed.\nOn arrival in Europa\xe2\x80\x99s orbit, the orbiting spacecraft supplies water and power to process into\nliquid oxygen and hydrogen using duplicate ISRU equipment on the orbiter. When fuel\nproduction is complete, the lander departs the orbiter and the NIMPH propulsion system deorbits\nand lands the vehicle at a selected site on the surface of Europa using this initial fuel load.\nFollowing a successful landing, the tank isolation valves are closed again, and the system is\nvented to vacuum until it is needed for ascent.\nAfter sample collection and propellant production phases of the surface mission are complete,\nthe NIMPH propulsion system returns the lander to orbit and rendezvous with the orbiter for\nretrieval and subsequent return to Earth.\nFeedlines are made from 316 stainless steel for LH2 and 18-8 stainless steel for LOx for material\nand cryogenic temperature compatibility.\n\n4.1 PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nThe NIMPH thruster design produces 71.5 N of thrust at 364 s Isp, yielding up to 1.81 km/s \xe2\x88\x86V\nwith the current propulsion system configuration.\nMass of the engine is 1.34 kg. Overall the engine is 145 mm long with an 85mm outside\ndiameter at the nozzle exit plane.\n\n4.2 ENGINE DESIGN\nNIMPH uses an original-design 71.5 N LH2-LO2 bipropellant engine, whose key characteristics\nare shown in Figure 4-2. The engine consists of two major components, a nozzle body and\ninjector head, which are 3-D printed to reduce design complexity, manufacturing and assembly\ncosts, and mass. A miniaturized ignitor\nprovides multiple restart capability.\n\n4.2.1 NOZZLE BODY\nThe nozzle body combines three\nprincipal elements of the engine \xe2\x80\x93\nnozzle, thrust chamber, and regenerative\ncooling jacket - into a single part 3-D\nprinted from Inconel 625.\nThe nozzle is 88.9 mm long from throat\nto exit plane, with an 70.7 mm interior\ndiameter (ID) at the exit plane and 11.2\nmm ID at the throat. The shape is a\nsimple cone of 18.7\xc2\xb0 half-angle. Above\nthe throat is the thrust chamber. The\nthrust chamber is 47.2 mm long and 25\nmm in internal diameter (including the\n\nFigure 4-2: Details of the NIMPH Main Engine\n\ninjector head dome) and operates at 506 kPa internal pressure.\nSurrounding the nozzle and thrust chamber is a regenerative cooling jacket. Liquid hydrogen fuel\nenters the jacket near the exit plane of the nozzle and is distributed around the nozzle\xe2\x80\x99s\nperiphery. From there it is forced upward through 24 coolant passages, which are parallel to the\naxis of the engine and integrally printed with the nozzle body. At the top of the thrust chamber,\nflow combines into a single circumferential collector plenum from which it exits through twelve\nports into the distribution plenum in the injector head. LH2 enters the jacket at sufficient pressure\nto reach the combustion chamber at 506 kPa when allowing for pressure losses inside the flow\npassages en route to the injector.\nThis component weighs 1.05 kg.\n\n4.2.2 INJECTOR HEAD\nThe injector head combines propellant distribution and injection and includes accommodation\nfor pressure and temperature sensors. It is 20 mm long and 37.8 mm in diameter (excluding the\nbolt flange and mounting features).\nLiquid oxygen feeds into the injector head along the axis of the engine. Inside, a circular\ndistribution plenum supplies 12 uniformly-spaced injection ports leading into the thrust chamber.\nLiquid hydrogen enters the injector head through the twelve distribution ports in the top of the\nnozzle body, into an annular distribution plenum, and out through matching injection ports.\nThe paired injection ports are angled to impinge at a point on an inclined/conical surface or\n(splash plate) inside the thrust chamber. This dual impingement (fuel with oxidizer, both\npropellants with the splash plate surface) assures thorough mixing and atomization of the liquid\npropellants as they enter the combustion zone.\nFour 3 mm dia. threaded ports for thrust\nchamber pressure and temperature\nsensors are provided.\nThis component weighs 0.25 kg.\n\n4.2.3 IGNITER\nThe NIMPH propulsion system is\nrequired to self-start during two mission\nphases: descent and landing on Europa,\nand ascent and rendezvous with the\norbiting satellite. With such a small\nengine and limited space and mass, the\nusual approaches (such as hypergolic\ninjection and exploding bridgewires)\nwere not feasible.\nInstead, the NIMPH ignitor (Figure 4-3)\nlights the engine on command by\ntriggering a spark through the splash\nplate injection zone. The simple selfregulating mechanism works like a\ncarbon arc-lamp to compensate for any\n\nFigure 4-3: NIMPH Miniature Ignitor\n\nerosion from the tip of the needle during startup and operation, supporting multiple restarts\nduring testing and operations.\nWhen the ignitor is activated, current passing through solenoid coil A pulls the moving armature\ndownward, pushing the needle-like moving electrode through the injection zone and into contact\nwith the grounded electrode. Current rises rapidly through solenoid coil B, wired in series with\nthe needle, creating an upward pull on the armature. As the electrodes draw apart an arc is\nstruck, and as the arc gap widens the current flow through the electrodes is reduced. The current\nthrough coil B decreases as a result, allowing coil A to pull the needle down again, and the\nsequence repeats.\nElectrically the arc can be thought of as a variable resistor, with coil B working to increase the\nresistance and coil A to decrease the resistance. The arc gap widens if the current increases and\nnarrows if the current decreases. The push-pull interplay of the two solenoid coils results in a\nself-regulating movement of the electrode as it maintains the arc gap required for the set\noperating current. Electrical energy is forced into the arc as heat sufficient to ignite the\nsurrounding mixture of atomized propellants.\nWhen ignition is successful and power is removed from the circuit, the return spring draws the\nneedle back into its insulating sleeve. The return spring also conducts the operating current to\nthe moving needle, and allows the needle to extend further into the injection area at startup to\naccount for tip erosion. The needle can erode up to 2 mm and still reach the grounded electrode,\nafter which the ignitor has reached the end of its useful life.\nThe ignitor body is 25 mm long and 13 mm in diameter, and is designed to have low power draw\n(5 A at 28 V) and a minimum of ten restarts of the engine for test firing and mission operations.\n\n4.3 PUMPS\nIn Phase I, we explored options for cryogenic pumps fitting the needs of the NIMPH propulsion\nsystem. The unusual combination of high compression ratio (10-1) and low mass flow rates (2.5\ng/s for LH2, 20 g/s for LO2) makes the selection of off-the-shelf components difficult. Cryogen\npumps on this scale are typically impeller-type designs, from which it is difficult to attain the\ncombination of pressure ratio and low mass flow rate.\nBarber-Nichols was the manufacturer whose products most closely met our needs. While they\ndid not have an off-the-shelf pump design which directly met these requirements, they provided\ntwo conceptual designs derived from existing products which will meet these performance\nspecifications.\n\n5.0 LANDER DESIGN\n5.1 CONFIGURATION OVERVIEW\nThe proposed configuration for the Europa Lander is shown in Figure 5-1 and Figure 5-2. In the\nstowed configuration, the lander is 954 mm tall and 878 mm at the widest. Figure 5-1 shows the\ngeneral dimensions of the lander. Figure 5-2 shows a detailed view of the Europa Lander,\nidentifying key components of the system. The lander consists of a cylindrical body surrounding\nthe hydrogen and oxygen tank. The hydrogen tank will be made of aluminum and used as a\nstructural member in the assembly, while the oxygen tank will be made of a composite material\n\nFigure 5-1: Europa Lander with Solar Array in Stowed Configuration\n\nto save on weight. Attached to the main structure are the three landing struts with the heaters in\nthe feet, which will sublimate the ice on the surface. Since the lander legs will likely get frozen\ninto the icy surface of the moon during the water harvesting process, the legs will detach from\nthe lander during takeoff. Leaving the legs behind will also reduce takeoff mass and improve\nlaunch margins. The top section of the lander, shown in yellow, contains all the avionics,\nbatteries, communications devices, as well as the ISRU equipment to convert the harvested water\ninto hydrogen and oxygen fuel.\nThe solar array of the lander is a disk shaped solar array measuring 1m in diameter, with 10\ntriangular sections. In the stowed configuration the triangular sections stack onto of the lander.\nThe solar array deploys, in a clockwise circle, with each section following the one before. The\nsolar array gimbal to deploy and maneuver the array consists of an extending rod to raise the\narray above the lander, and two independent rotation gimbals, to allow for a \xc2\xb1180\xc2\xb0 pitch rotation,\nand a \xc2\xb135\xc2\xb0 yaw rotation. This range of motion allows the solar array to track to the orbiting\nsatellite to maintain maximum power transfer.\nThe engine of the lander is located below the hydrogen tank, attached to the main structure of the\nlander. Two electromagnetic pumps are located with the thruster, to supply the hydrogen and\noxygen fuel to the system. An Attitude Control System (ACS) will be used on the lander. Two\npairs of opposing cold gas thruster will be placed near the exterior of the vehicle. These thrusters\nwill provide pitch, yaw and roll control. The cold gas used will be hydrogen siphoned off the\nregenerative cooling of the hydrogen tank.\n\nFigure 5-2: Detailed View of Europa Lander\n\n5.2 MASS SUMMARY\nThe estimated masses for the Europa Lander are summarized by subsystem in Table 5-1. The\ncurrent best estimate for the lander dry mass is 24.24 kg. For all categories, a Mass Growth\nAllowance (MGA) of 1.1 to 1.2 was used to allow for any uncertainty in the estimate based on\nthe fidelity of the design. The estimated mass with MGA is 27.75 kg. We also add a 10%\nsystem margin to the vehicle.

With a 500 km altitude orbiter,\nthe satellite is in view for 39.2 minutes of\neach 173.1 minute orbit. The laser provides\na flux of 2734 W/m2 at the array. We\nassume a 60% conversion efficiency.\nHowever, we have 17.8% losses from\npacking\nfactor\n&\nmanufacturing\nimperfections and 8% losses from environmental effects such as radiation & temperature. The\nlatter actually offsets radiation as the cold temperatures improve cell efficiency. This results in\n478 W of electrical power at 12 VDC.\nWhile on the surface, very little power is drawn outside of the \xce\xbcISRU system. Besides the\n\xce\xbcISRU, power is required for the processor, telecommunications system, gimbal, heaters and\nrecharging the battery. During eclipse, power is driven by heating the lander. Table 5-2\nsummarizes the power requirements. Power margin is currently at 6.5% during laserlight and\n15% during eclipse. A late increase in ISRU power during Ph I eroded 20 W of planned margin.\n\nFigure 5-3: System Components\n\nDuring Ph II, we will evaluate ways to increase the power margins.\nEnergy storage is accomplished with Li-ion batteries. We assume a 96% charge efficiency and\n90% discharge efficiency. The 22.95 Ahr batteries provide a 10% energy margin to a 40% depth\nof discharge.\n\n5.4 ELECTRONICS SUMMARY\nThe lander\xe2\x80\x99s core electronic boards (see Figure 5-3) are stacked together in a radiation-hardened\nvault for protection against the harsh radiation environment of Europa and the Jovian system.\nThe Power Board receives raw power from the resonant array and contains the regulation\ncircuitry necessary to supply each of the components and subsystems on the spacecraft. In all,\nthere are 26 switches (see Figure 5-4) available on the power distribution board. This includes\n12V power to the avionics, guidance, pumps, electrolyzer, compressors, electronic valves, and\nturbine.\nThe Adapter Board consists of a rad hard processor as well as all the connectors to provide\npower and/or communications to the other components and units not located on the board stack.\n\nFigure 5-4: Power Distribution Board Layout\n\nThe processor controls and communicates with the stack through an onboard bus that carries\nboth power and communications. The board links to the Battery Board via I2C, while RS422\ninterfaces relay commands, communications, and spacecraft health data.\nThe Battery Board controls power storage and provides backup power to vital units on the\nspacecraft while overhead satellite is out of range to power the lander.\nThe Array and TVC Control Board provides control to the gimbal unit connected to the resonant\narray to maximize power from the overhead satellite, and operates the main engine gimbal for\npitch and yaw control.\nThe Transceiver Board maintains communications with the overhead satellite, the latter relaying\ncommands and telemetry with mission control during free-flying and Europa surface operations.\nA CAPS-3 Controller Board controls micro-thrusters which provide roll control to the\nspacecraft.\nA Blue Canyon XACT unit combines multiple GN&C components (star tracker, inertial\nmeasurement, reaction control wheels, sun sensor) into a single package. For autonomous site\nselection and landing operations, we include a SPEC lidar for range and obstacle detection.\n\nFigure 5-5: System Block Diagram\n\nA block diagram for the lander is shown in Figure 5-5.\n\n6.0 MISSION COST ESTIMATE\nThe bulk of the mission cost is driven by the launch vehicle and the SEP Module. The Atlas V\ncost is estimated using ULA\xe2\x80\x99s online tool. According to the tool, an Atlas V 551 with the full\nspectrum service option is $173M. We\xe2\x80\x99ve rounded this value up to $180M.\nCost of the SEP Module is based on ExoTerra\xe2\x80\x99s detailed cost analysis performed as part of our\nAsteroid Redirect Mission Study for NASA. The cost estimate included quotes from vendors for\nhardware items, and assembly by Ball Aerospace. The recurring cost for the module was under\n$170M.\nMission operations costs have been estimated assuming a staff of 6 personnel monitoring the\nspacecraft 8 hrs per day for 15 years. At a labor rate of $150/hr, this results in $39M in\noperations labor costs. Using the DSN pricing tool, we estimate DSN costs at $100k per year,\nresulting in $1.5M over the lifetime of the mission. We have rounded the total cost up to $41M.\nLander costs are based a proposal for a similarly sized (45 kg) microsatellite ExoTerra proposed\nto the NASA Edison program to perform proximity operations. The equipment used in the\nmicrosatellite was used as the basis for the bus used on our lander, and the proximity operations\nmission was comparable in complexity to landing. Total cost to develop the microsatellite was\n<$15M.\nIn addition to the basic lander costs, we anticipate that 3 key items will need to be qualified: the\nISRU, LOx/LH2 Engine, and power beaming. We anticipate that the ISRU can be developed\nand qualified for $2.5M. This roughly an SBIR Ph II award with Ph III support. We anticipate\nthe engine will be more complicated and doubled the ISRU estimate to $5M to design and\nqualify. We have estimated the power beaming will require a similar $5M.\nDue to the coarseness of the estimate, we\xe2\x80\x99ve included a 20% ROM factor of $83M. This brings\nthe total mission cost to $502M.\n\n7.0 PHASE II RECOMMENDATION\nAnalysis of the NIMPH concept during Phase I has supplied promising results. All aspects of\nthe design have shown feasibility with margin. This includes the trajectory analysis, power\ndelivery system, propellant production, system mass, radiation exposure, and thruster\nperformance.\nThe study has revealed an affordable means of sample return from Europa that can be used for\nsample return missions from the Moon, Mars, and other Jovian moons. In addition, ExoTerra\nhas received interest in the ISRU system in support of Asteroid Mining companies. This\nprovides potential commercial uses in addition to scientific sample return, expanding the\ntechnologies applicability.\nWhile the system shows promise, many items still need to be resolved before it can be\nimplemented. Key risks to the system include:\n1. Effects of thermal capacitance in lines and their impact on the overall efficiency of\nthe \xce\xbcISRU and \xce\xbcLOx/LH2 engine. This may require a precooling system, or we may\nneed to trade the impact of operating with gaseous H2 v. liquid H2.\n2. Development of micro-pumps, compressors and turbines to the required scale and\ndemonstration of performance.\n\n3. Demonstration of the electrolyzer performance at scale.\n4. Demonstration of power beaming system, including efficiencies and collimation\naccuracy.\n5. Demonstration of power beaming pointing system.\n6. Completion of the SEP Module.\n7. Completion of a LOx/Methane engine development.\n8. Radiation shielding\nExoTerra recommends proceeding to Phase II with a focus on developing and testing a\nfunctional prototype of the \xce\xbcISRU system and micro-LOx/LH2 engine. This mitigates several of\nthe risks by demonstrating the ability to maintain stringent landed mass requirements, production\nefficiencies, and thruster performance.\n\n8.0 BIBLIOGRAPHY\n1.
