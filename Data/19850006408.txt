Marshall Space Flight Center of NASA is located near\n\nHuntsville, in the heart of north Alabama\'s productive Tennessee Valley.\nThe Marshall Center, directed by Dr. William R. Lucas, has approximately\n\n3,500 employees. Approximately 2,200 employees hold professional degrees\nand over 100 hold Ph.D.\'s in the physical sciences and engineering. The\n\nResident Research Associateship program at the Marshall Center is managed\nby Dr. Fred A. Speer, Associate Director for Science.\nThe laboratories within the Science and Engineering element of the Center\nprovide research opportunities for Resident Research Associates. The missions\nof the Center are the design and development of space transportation systems,\ntailored to manned and unmanned payload requirements; design and development of scientific payloads, payload carriers and other systems required\n\nfor ongoing and future space exploration; system, engineering and overall\nsystems integration of vehicles Lind payloads; planning and implementation\nof a space-materials processing program; research related to space exploration\n\nin the science and engineering discipiines; and technical program management\nof programs involving space vehicles, payloads, and systems. The Marshall\n\nCenter has more than 150 buildings with extensive laboratory facilities located\non its 1,800 acres.\nThe University of Alabama in Huntsville has an undergraduate school and\na graduate school with an extensive curriculum in the physical sciences and\nengineering. Alabama A&M University and Oakwood College are also\n\nlocated in Huntsville. An excellent library exists at the Redstone Scientific\nInformation Center, sponsored jointly by the Army and NASA. It has an\noutstanding collection of technical literature.\nHuntsville is also the home of the Redstone Arsenal, where the U.S. Army\nconducts military rorkct research and development. Huntsville is known as\n\nthe "Space Capital of the U.S." It is on-- of the oldest communities in the\nState of Alabama, dating from 1805. The population in 1980 was approximately 140,000. A modern jet airpor, serves the air-transportation needs of\nthis community. Recreation opportunities abound nearby on the numerous\nlakes of the Tennessee River and in the heavily wooded mountains. The\n\ne\na\n\nmajor cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta are within a few hours\ndrive of Huntsville.\n\nh\nF\'\nw\nI^\n\n0\n\nl\n\nIii\n\na\nd\n\n1d .a\n\nContents\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI\n\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH\nMaterials and Processes Laboratory\nSpace Science Laboratory\nSystems Dynamics Laboratory\nINDEX OF LABORATORY DIRECTORS\nAND RESEARCH ADVISERS\n\n9\n13\n17\n21\n\nt\n\nk\n\nA^\n\nIntroduction\nGeneral Information\nThe National Research Council (NRC) conducts the Resident Research\n\nAssociateship Programs in cooperation with a number of sponsoring Federal\nlaboratories and research organizations approved by the NRC for participation.\nIn the programs, a national competition is conducted by the NRC to recommend\nand make awards to outstanding scientists and engineers at the recent\npostdoctoral and experienced senior levels for tenure as guest investigators\nat the participating laboratories. These programs have been conducted with\na number of Federal agencies since 1954.\nThe objectives of the program are\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to provide postdoctoral scientists and engineers of unusual promise and\nability opportunities for research on problems, largely of their own choice,\nthat are compatible with the research interests of the sponsoring la\'ioratories\nand\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to contribute thereby to the overall research effort of he Federal\n\nlaboratories.\nThese programs are intended to be analogous to fellowships associateships,\n\nand similar temporary programs at the doctoral level in universities and other\norganizations. They are neither intended to be, nor to compete with, permanent\nprofessional career positions.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An NRC Resident Research Associate is a guest investigator, not an\nemployee of the National Research Council or of the laboratory, and there\nis no obligation to either organization during or after completion of tenure.\nFor recent doctoral graduates, the program provides an opportunity for\n\nconcentrated research in association with selected members of the permanent\nprofessional laboratory staff, often as a climax to formal career preparation.\nFor established scientists and engineers, the program affords an opportunity\nfor research without the interruptions and distracting assignments of permanent\n\ncareer positions. The participating laboratories and centers receive a stimulus\nto their research programs by the presence of bright, highly motivated recent\ndoctoral graduates and senior investigators with established records of research\n\n,t\n\nproductivity. New ideas, techniques, and approaches to problems contribute\nto the overall research climate of the laboratories. Indirectly, the program\nalso makes available to the broader scientific and engineering communities\n\nr\n\ni,\xc2\xb0 r ^y.\n\n\' A. A!^M\n\nF ^^p t^, r.\n\nthe excellent and often unique research facilities that exist in the government\'s\nlaboratories\nApplications for awards will be received by the Associateship Programs\noffice of the NRC and will be evaluated on a competitive basis by special\nNRC panels of scientists and engineers. For the 1984 program year, it is\nanticipated that approximately 1,000 applications will be received for the\nnearly 250 new awards to be made in the NRC Research Associateship\nPrograms.\nDescribed in this booklet are areas of research in which Research\nAssociateships may bt awarded at the George C. Marshall Space Flight\nCenter (MSFC). Each applicant is responsible for formulating a specific\nresearch plan on a problem that is related to the current research interests of\nthe laboratory in which the applicant wishes to do research.\nApplicants whose research interests appear to be related to one or more of\nthe opportunities described in this booklet are advised to communicate directly\nwith the research adivsers who are designated for those areas of research.\nResearch advisers can provide more specific information on current research\nprograms and available technical facilities. Further inquiries concerning\nresearch opportunities and advisers may be directed to the NPC-NASA\nLaboratory Program Representative:\n\nDr. Fred A. Speer\nAssociate Dhictor for Science\nD530\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama 35812\nTelephone: (205) 453-3033\nEach applicant\'s proposed plan of research must be approved by one of\nthe research advisers listed herein and endorsed by the program committee\nof the MSFC to be eligible for an award. The endorsement affirms that the\nproposed research problem is compatible with the laboratory\'s interest and\nthat adequate programmatic support will be available if an award is offered.\nA written response regarding each applicant\'s proposed research problem\nmust be received from the laboratory by the Associateship Programs office\nbefore an applicant will be reviewed by the NRC evaluation panels. The\nCenter\'s action on the research proposal, together with a copy of the adviser\'s\ncomments, will be provided directly to the applicant by the NRC Program\nRepresentative at the MSFC. It must also be determined that the applicant is\nacceptable for resident status at a NASA Center.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 All applicants should note that endorsement by a research adviser and/\nor laboratory, while an essential component of the application process, must\nnot be assumed to imply or guarantee an award by the NRC. Applicants are\nformally recommended for awards only after open, national competition, in\nwhich special NRC-appointed panels rank candidates on the basis of quality\nalone. Final ranking in order of quality and the recommendation of applicants\nfor awards are the exclusive prerogatives of these panels, and notification\n\nonly by the NRC of an applicant\'s status in the competition is authoritative.\n\ns \xe2\x80\x94d^\t\n\n?<\n\n\'Sj%\n\n\t\n\nEligibility of Applicants\nCitlzenship\nResearch opportunities in basic science and applied srience and technology\ndescribed in this booklet are open to all citizens of the United States.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Non-U.S. citizens may submit research proposals in basic science areas\nonly and must have full command of the English language. Non-U.S.\n\nnationals who become Associates must have valid visas throughout tenure.\nOnly Exchange Visitor and Immigrant Visas are acceptable to the NRC. If\nan awardee chooses to apply for an Exchange Visitor Visa, the sponsorship\nmust be under the NRC. If one chooses to apply for a U.S. Immigrant Visa,\nthe NRC will not be involved in the matter.\nEducatlon and Experience\nAwardees must hold the Ph.D., Sc.D., or other earned research doctoral\ndegree recognized in U.S. academic circles as equivalent to the Ph.D. or\nmust present acceptable evidence of having completed all the formal academic\nrequirements for one of these degrees before tenure may be initiated.\nApplicants must have demonstrated superior ability for creative research. An\napplicant\'s training and research experience may be in any appropriate\n\ndiscipline or combination of disciplines required for the proposed research.\nPrior Affiliation with the Laboratory\nA primary objective of the Associateship Programs is to provide a\nmechanism for new ideas and new sources of stimulation to be. brought to\nthe sponsoring laboratory. Thus, persons with substantial recent prior\naffiliation with a specific laboratory may not be eligible to apply for an\nAssociateship at that laboratory.\nSubstantial recent prior affiliation includes direct employment relationships\neither with the laboratory or with a contractor whose work is performed at\nthe laboratory. A long-term consulting relationship with the laboratory usually\nmakes the applicant ineligible. Research contracts with universities that\nprovide support for graduate students and faculty performing research on the\ncampus are not ordinarily considered disqualifying.\nReap t . ,cation\nPersons who have previously held an NRC Research Associateship may\napply for another award only if a period of at least two years will have\n\n8\t\n\nw\n\nt\t\n\nr ,\n\n%;bar\n;^ t F\n\n\t\n\n6 5c\n\nelapsed between termination of the first award and the proposed tenure of a\nsecond award. Persons who have previously applied for an NRC Associateship,\n\nbut who were not recommended for an award by the NRC panels, may\nreapply after one year. Candidates who were recommended for an award by\nthe NRC panels, but who were not offered an award because of funding or\nother limitations, may reapply at any time without a mandatory waiting\nperiod.\nConsideration\nQualified applicants will receive consideration without regard to race,\ncreed, color, age, sex, or national origin.\nConditions of theAward\nRegular Research Associateships will be awarded to persons who have\nheld the doctorate less than five years at the time of application and will be\nmade initially for one year.\nSenior Research Associateships are awarded only to investigators who\nhave held the doctorate five years or more at the time of application. Senior\napplicants should have resea ." h experience that has resulted in significant\n\ncontributions and recognition as established investigators in their specialized\nfields. Awards to senior Associates will generally be for one year; however,\nawards for shorter periods will be considered.\nUnder certain conditions, extensions will be granted to allow Associates\nto bring their research programs to a reasonable stage of completion. An\nextension must not be assumed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 No commitment on the part of an Associate, the sponsoring laborator,/,\nor the NRC with regard to later employment is implied or should be infetred\n\nby the offer or acceptance of an award.\nThese Research Associateships are tenable only at the approved, partici-\n\npating laboratories listed in this booklet. No period of the Associateship\ntenure may be spent in residence at another laboratory or institution. Associates\nwill have the status of visiting scientists or engineers in the laboratory but\nwill be subject to the general working conditions at the laboratory. The\nGeorge C. Marshall Space Flight Center, which provides the funds to support\nthis program, will furnish all necessary suppon services, facilities, and\nequipment for the approved iesearch program of each Associate.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Although applications for NRC-NASA Research Associateships will be\n\naccepted throughout the year, they will be evaluated in competition only\nduring certain periods. Three competitive reviews will be held in 1984.\n\nCompleted applications that are postmarked not later than January 15, April\ntIn\n\nrY;G.\t\n\ne\n\neflJgl^..\n\n^i\n\n15, and August 15, and received by the NRC not later than January 25, April\n25, and August 25, will be reviewed for announcement of awards in March,\nJuly, and November, respectively. The NRC must be advised by the MSFC\nthat the proposed research has been approved; otherwise, the NRC will\nassume that the proposed research is not of sufficient current interest to\nNASA or that support facilities cannot be made available.\nAssociateship awards will be made by the NRC. The date on which tenure\nof an Associateship award may begin is negotiated on an individual basis.\nTenure should normally begin within six months of the award; however, the\nstarting date may be delayed by mutual agreement of the MSFC, the\n\nAssociate, and the NRC. Sufficient time must be allowed between the offer\nof an award and the beginning of tenure to enable the NRC and the MSFC\nto complete all necessary administrative procedures. The starting date cannot\nbe later than 12 months from the date of the original award. If this condition\ncannot be met, a new application, including a newly approved plan of\nresearch, must be submitted to the NRC and will be judged without prejudice\nin the next competition.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 While every effort has been made by the participating Center or laboratory\n\nto provide Research Opportunities of ample scope and relevance, the\nappearance of any Research Opportunity in this booklet does not guarantee\nthat it will be available at the time Associateship awards are offered. Changes\nand/or deletions may occur following the publication of this booklet, and all\nopportunities are subject to final review and approval by the laboratory and\nthe NRC prior to the awarding of tenure.\n\nStipend\nA Research Associate will receive a stipend from the NRC while carrying\n\nout the research proposed as part of the application procedure. The current\nstipend for a regular Research Associate is at the annual rate of $24,500.\nThe base is subject to adjustments from time to time in accordance with\ngeneral national guidelines pertaining to scientists and engineers. An appropriately higher stipend will be offered to senior Associates.\nFollowing current salary practices in certain professional fields that are\nexperiencing a short supply of new doctoral graduates, a stipend supplement\n\nmay be allotted by the NRC to awardees in those disciplines. For the 1984\nprogram year, stipend supplements of up to $5,000 may be added to the\nbasic stipend for regular awardees holding recognized doctoral degrees in\n\nengineering, computer science, and clinical space-biomedical science.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Applicants are cautioned against entering into any agreement or understanding with individual Research Advisers or other laboratory personnel\nconcerning additional funding or other remuneration for work as an Associate.\nStipends for Research Associates are limited to the amounts and by the\n\n.I^\n\nk .\n\nconditions set forth above, and any other arrangement, formal or informal,\nbetween an applicant and laboratory personnel for additional monies or other\nconsiderations is strictly prohibited by the NRC.\nCommitment\nAssociates must devote their full-time effort to the approved research\nprogram and must be in residence at the sponsoring laboratory during the\nentire period of the Associateship. No additional monetary aid or other\nremuneration may be accepted from another appointment, fellowship, or\nsimilar grant, except for sabbatical leave, during the period of the Associateship.\n\nTaxes and Insuranne\n\nAll Associates are, in effect, self-employed. All arrangements for payment\nof income taxes are the responsibility of the individual Associate. An\nappropriate amount, estimated to approximate the tax liability of foreign\nnationals, will be withheld by the NRC from stipends of non-U.S. Associates\non Exchange Visitor Visas. Details will be provided at the time of the award.\nJob-related injury or death will be covered by insurance (workmen\'scompensation type). A group health insurance program is required for\n\nAssociates and optional for dependents.\nRelocation and Travel\nA suitable relocation reimbursement will be determined for each awardee.\nDetails will be provided at the :ime of the award. Funds will also be made\navailable for limited professional travel during tenure, provided such travel\nis recommended in advance by an Associate\'s research adviser at the MSFC\nand approved by the NRC.\nPublication\nSince an Associate\'s later scientific and technical career will be judged by\nothers, publication in the accepted open technical literature is highly encouraged. Publications should include a statement indicating that the research\nwas conducted while the author held an NRC Research Associateship.\nSummary of the Application Procedure\nFor further details on the application procedure, refer to the Instructions that\naccompany the application rgcket.\nG\t\n\ns\n\n.g a\n\n\'_\n\n\t\n\no\n?m ^\t.h<f H\n\n.rte 4S/^\' ..\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Associateship Programs office of the NRC will receive all appli\ncations and supporting documents and conduct the competitive evaluation of\napplications.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Detailed information on application procedures, all necessary forms,\nand a list of the supporting documents required are available on request from\nthe\n\nAssociateship Programs (1F1 608)\nNational Research Council\n2101 Constitution Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20418\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Application materials from previous competitions must not be used.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Submit the following to the Associatcship Programs office:\nSigned Application form\nOffice Card\nResearch Proposal (one copy with original signa-ure on\neach page)\n\nApproval of Research Form (one set)\nPrevious and Current Research form\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The above application mateuai. must be postmarked no later than January\n15, 1984, April 15, 1984, and August 15, 1984, and must be received in the\nAssociateship Programs office uo later than January 25, April 25, and August\n25, respectively.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Have the following sent directly to the Associateship Programs office:\nOfficial transcripts of all graduate and undergraduate credits (not required\nfor senior applicants\'\nFour Reference Reports from tlic respondents listed on the Application.\nOnly official Refer. ncc Report forms may be used by regular applicants.\nLetters of reference will be accepted for senior applicants.

The advanced research and development activities are\nconducted primarily in the laboratories of the Science and Engineering\nDirectorates of the Center. Applicants interested in a particular laberaimy\nshould write to the Director of the Laboratory. The Director will arrange for\nappropriate technical personnel, normally the Research Advisers, to communicatc with the applicant. Names of potential Research Advisers are shown\nfor each research opportunity.\nMaterials and Processes Laboratory\n\nR.J. Schwinghanner, Director\n77tc Materials and Processes Laboratory conducts research in support of\n-lice-vehicle and payloads development. Major technology and research\nits are under way in physics and chemistry of materials, both metallic\noral nonmetallic, and in critical environments at cryogenic to high-temperature\nlevels. In addition, comprehensive research and developmeni activities are\npursued in qualification and testing of materials. The laboratory also develops\n(light experiments and processing equipment in order to study the effects of\nweightlessness on materials processing in space\nThe laboratory is equipped with modern to support in-depth\nexperimental research in areas such as heat transfer, two-phase flow,\ncryogenics, passive and active thermal control, and space radiation effects\non materials and has extensive facilities for chemistry and physics, including\nthe latest metallurgical and nondestructive testing capabilities. For terrestrial\n\t concepttesting of space processes, drop-lower testing and it\nverification test module for the SPACELAE to be carried by the SPACE\n\nSHUTTLE are available. The laboratory is instrumental in a space Processing\nexperiment program using sounding rockets as a test bed for the development\nof SPACE SHUTTLE payloads in the area of materials-manufacturing\nprocesses.\n\nFluid Lubrictuds\n\n44.70.62.01\n\nA.F. Whitaker\t\ny\t\n\nThe environments of outer space have proven exceptionally hazardous to the\n\noperation of mechanical components because of the inability of normal fluid\n9\n0\n\nF y^ ^ kr+\n\n-,;-\n\n.41\n\nlubricants to operate in hard vacuum and at both high and low temperatures.\nTherefore, it\n\t research program is under way to evaluate various\nsynthetic and highly refined mineral oils in it of simulated space\nenvironments. This program covers both theoretical studies in hydrodynamic\nand ciastohydrodynamic film formation and statistical studies of thousands\nof bearing tests being conducted in special environmental chambers from one\nto live years. The results to date have led to special emphasis on a class of\nsynthetic lubricants designated as peril uoroalkypoly-ethers. These fluids, as\na class, are fully fluorinated and are therefore exceptionally stable. A recent\nimprovement in this synthetic has provided a vacuum-stable lubricant capable\nof operation front\n\t than \xe2\x80\x94 70\xc2\xb0C to over 250\xc2\xb0C. The effect of Hertz-range\npressures on fluid viscosity is currently being investigated for these and other\nspace-compatible I-jbricant systems. The work being carried out in tkis area\n\nincludes complete, characterization of the test fluids using viscometers and\nextreme-pressure test equipment. Although considerable progress has been\nmade in the development of fl,tid lubricants for use in space, an almost\n\nunlimited amount of research still waits to meet the ever-increasing demands\nof future space programs.\nMetallic Materials Research\n\xe2\x80\xa214.70.62.02\nB.N. Uhat\t\nThe laboratory has a wide array of metallurgical research and engineering\nprojects under way for advancing material properties to lit SPACE SHUTTLE\n\nrequirements. These include development of improved alloys and processes\nto achieve reliable welding properties and superior fracture toughness and\ncorrosion resistance to meet the demands of the extreme environments of\nlaunch and recovery, including high aerodynamic heating and final seawater\nimmersion. The laboratory is well equipped to perform metallurgical research\n\nin the areas of metals processing, mechanical testing, corrosion control, and\nalloy develo pment. The metals-procrssing equipment includes foundry, heat\ntreatmen. and various metalworkmg facilities with the capability of casting\nand firiol mg experimental melts up to 50 Ibs of iron or nickel alloys. The\nmechanical testing equipment includes tensile, fatigue, and creep machines\noperating in various programmable load ranges up to 600,000 pounds static\nand 150,000 pounds dynamic, at test-specimen temperatures ranging from\n\xe2\x80\x9447.3\xc2\xb0F to 2000\xc2\xb0F, and in various environments including high-pressure\n\ngaseous hydrogen. Improvements currently being implemented include a\ncentral automatic data-processing system and the development of a second\nhigh-pressure environmental test chamber with elevated temperature capability\nfor tests in gaseous hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen-rich steam, and\nammonia. Corrosion-control equipment includes test facilities for eriviron-\n\nmental exposure to a variety of atmospheres, corrosion-fatigue equipment,\nelectroplating facilities, and instrumenUtion for a wide range of electrochemical studies. Various analytical tools, such as the transmission electron\nmicroscope, scanning electron microscope with cnerg^ dispersive X-ray\n10\n\ni#n\n\n1^.\nYT ^j X w\n\n\t\n\n^O\n\n-d"\n\nanalysis, Auger Spectrometer, and X-ray d (fraction equipment, are available\nin addition to the standard ntetallugraphic facilities.\nGeneral areas of interest in metallurgical research include linear and\nnonlinear fracture mechanics, effects of hostile environments on mechanical\nproperties, alloy development, characterization of advanced materials, development and optimization of advanced metals-processing methods, and\ntechnique for evaluation of corrosion phenomena and corrosion-control\nmethods. The following are t ypical of current activities in metallurgical\nresearch: effects of high-pressure hydrogen on mechanical properties, including the determination of transition compositions where degradation begins\nin selected alloy systems; alloy-intproveme :t studies in the nickel-copper\nalloy system; dimensional ,tabilit) of alloys after thermal-cycle exposures;\neffect of various biaxial stress distributions on the ductility of u nickel alloy\nan gaseous hydrogen; studies on superplasticity in selected commercial alloys;\nthermal fatigue studies on solar-cell conncctaons; corrosion fatigue of highstrength nickel alloys; art of the stress corrosion susceptibility of\nhigh-strength steels and aluminum alloys, retained austenite measurements\nin bearing steels; development of single-crystal turbine-blade materials; and\nimproved bearing alloys for application in advanced turbopunips.\nP^tymer Science\nW.J. Patterson 44.70.62.03\nPolymers fulfill critical functions in space components and haidware, typilied\nby the numerous applications of rigid plastics, synthetic rubber, structural\nadhesives, electrical and thermal insulations, composite materials, and similar\nproducts. During the SATURN program, this laboratory pioneered in the\ndevelopment and utilization of cellular plastic thermal insulations and\nstructural adhesives. The extension of this technology to the SPACE\nSHUTTLE imposes in some cases the dual additional requirements of elevated\ntemperature stability and reuse capability. Current research interests encompass the following specific eraw preparation, characterization, and study of\nnovel polymers with improved thermal, mechanical, dielectric, or environmental performance chamct_\xe2\x80\xa2 ristics; the development of improved methods\nof accelerated life testing and prediction based on theological, dielectric, and\nmechanical parameters; elucidation of polymer structural and morphological\nfeatures that contribute to specific attributes, such as low-temperature\nflexibility, lilm-forming and adhesive characteristics. UV resistance, and\nother desired features.\nFacilities and equipment are available for the preparation, purification,\nanalysis, and characterization of inte-niediates; the preparation of test and\nprototype end items; and the mechanical and dielectric testing of polymer\ntest configurations in diverse environments.\n\ny\na\t\n\nSpace Environmental Effects\nA.F.

The objectives of this laboratory in the\nresearch area are to perform real-time and accelerated testing and evaluation,\ndevelop accelerated testing methodology, investigate basic and synergistic\ndamage mechanisms, develop theoretical models for material life prediction,\ndevelop environmentally stable advanced materials, and provide a desibn\ndata base for space-systems development.\nResearch studies are conducted to identify changes in thr, physical, chemical,\nelectrical, and optical properties of materials induced by environmental insult;\nto define degradation mechanisms by which the environmental parameters\ninteract with the materials; and to correlate the data with interactiondegradation-prediction models. Specific materials currently requiring characterization are the composite materials, both the fiber-resin composites\n(graphite-, boron-, and Ke \xe2\x80\xa2 lar- fibers in -epoxy or -polyimide resin) and the\nfiber-metal matrix advanced composites (graphite-aluminum, graphite-magnesium, boron-aluminum); the polymeric fibers (Kapton, Mylar); optical (AI/\nMgF=, AI/SiO 2 ) or thermal (Al, si, Ti, Zr oxide pigments in inorganic KSiO2\n\nor organic acrylic or silicon binder) control coatings; glasses (silica); and\ninsulations (MLI).\nA component requiring extensive research is the high-efficiency solar cell,\n\nespecially in the low-temperature low-light-intensity space environment.\nThe laboratory irradiation facilities are located in several buildings with\nthe electron/proton Van de Graaff accelerators all in the Radiation Effects\nFacility. Solar irradiations are done with X-25, X-75, and X-200 solar\nsimulators in associated vacuum chambers that range from I to 40 ft in\ndiameter. Measurement systems include thermal-vacuum weight loss, volatile\ncondensable materials (VCM), residual gas analysis (RGA), linear variable\ndisplacement transfornier (LVDT) creep, tensile and elongation, optical\nspectral transmission and reflectance, and solar-cell electronic load-test\napparatus. This equipment base is being updated and expanded to meet new\nrequirements as they are generated to develop and qualify materials and\n\ncomponents for the future programs of NASA.\nWelding Research\nA.C.

The welding facility is backed up by facilities for\nmetallography, chemical analysis, and miscellaneous testing, including Gleeble testing, in which rapid heating and cooling programs can be combined\n12\n\npc\nBLS t, L_\n\n\t\n\ny ?t^h t i t.\n\n4\n\nwith a programmed stress sequence to study the effect of welding temperature/\nstress histories on the properties of metals.\nGeneral areas of research center around computer modeling of heat-flow\nand/or weld-puddle dynamics that control material properties and defect\nformation in the vicinity of the weld Lind the relation of weld-strength\nproperties to weld structure. Typical recent or anticipated studies are weld\ngeometry strength effect in 2219-T87 aluminum, microfissuring in Inconel\n718, depth fluctuations (spiking) in partial-penetration electron-beam welds,\nweld-puddle physics, two-parameter computer model of welding arc and\nbeam penetration, parallel-gap welding of solar cells, and comparison of\nvariable polarity-plasma arc-weld processes with gas-shielded tungsten-urc\nwelding. An electron-beam welder has been oncrated in space (a SPACELAO\nexperiment). Considerable industrial interest has been shown in the tv,SFC\ntwo-parameter weld-penetration model.\nThe light-but-strong requirement for space structures and the castastrophic\nconsequence of failure present a powerful impetus for understanding of the\ndetails of veld processes and for the transformation of the art of welding to\na science.\nRobotic Welding Sensor\nA.C. Nunes, Jr. 44.70.62.06\nApplication of robots to welding of Shuttle structural components presents\nmany interesting and challenging problems in positioning of the torch, control\nof the weld parameters, and monitoring of the system variable. The\ncomplicating factors are sensor performance in the intense thermal environment of tb. weld and the size and location of the sensor relative to the weld.\nA research effort is necessary to address each problem individually and as a\nsystem, in order to develop an optimized approach to sensing the required\nphenomena and feedback system, and to use the information to enhance\nwelding on the Shuttle structural elements and their predecessors.\n\nSpace Science Laboratory\nA.J.

One category emphasizes scientific data analysis\nb rY\n13\nt\ne\n\n0\n\nand interpretation of X-ray observations obtained with the UIIURU. SAS-3,\nHEAO-I, and IIEAO-2 (Einstein) satellites. Specific studies currently in\nprogress concern the time variability of galactic X-ray sources. This research\nrequires u background in theoretical astrophysics and data analysis.

In addition, it laboratory research\nprogram studying the X-ray scattering properties of various materials that\nmay be used for the AXAF X-ray telescope is also in progress.\nOpportunities for research in gamma-ray astronomy emphasize the study\nof transient gamma-ray sources and gamma-ray bursts using large-area\nscintillation detectors. Balloon-borne instruments are used for these studies,\nand an advanced detector system for the Ganuna Ray Observatory is being\ndeveloped. Studies of the gamma-ray background and file limitations it\nimposes on ballon-borne and satellite-borne gamma-ray observations are\nbeing pursued.\nCosmic-ray research includes measurement of the chemical composition\nand energy spectra of nuclei above 10\'IcV and studies of nuclear interactions\na! these energies.

Chappell D.L. Reasoner L.R. Lyons\t\n44.70.90.03\nN.IJ. Stone\t\nG.R. Swenson J.L. Green\nThis research is centered around the study of plasma processes in the Earth\'s\nmagnetosphere. Particular emphasis is placed oil characteristics of the\nlow-energy thermal plasma of the plasmasphere and ionosphere, the nlediumenergy plasma responsible for auroral phenomena, interactions between these\nplasma populations, and the resulting effects on the upper atmosphere. Both\nflight experiments and laboratory simulation experiments are conducted.\nIn the flight experiment program, activities include the design, development,\n14\n\n_._\t\n\n3\n\nr\n\nand calibration of the flight instrumentation and the analysis and interpretation\nof the resulting data. The flight program includes experiments on unmanned\n\nsatellites and on SPACE SHUTTLE flights.

Ionospheric plasma parameters are simulated\nin the facility, and wake and sheath effects oI\' bodies in the streaming plasma\nare studied. The plasma chamber is used also to study the plasma around\nbodies, such as comets and planets, in space.\nGround-based renwte-sensing observations of visible auroral emissions are\nbeing performed. Theoretical examination of file measured cni;ssion intensities\nand line shapes is conducted to develop an understanding of upper mesopheric\nand therntospheric processes.

Hagyard\t\nR. Moore\nSolar physics research ranges over satellite-experiment data analvses, particularly in Solar Maximum Mission (SMM), theoretical studies, and groundhased observations and imalyscs.\n\nCurrent areas of endeavor in theoretical research include magnetohydrodymamic modeling of active solar events, such as solar flares; modeling of\nsurge and spray events and flare-triggering mechanisms; emission-line profile\namdysis; radiative transfer with magnetic fields; and numerical methods for\ndata analysis. Coordinated ground-based solar observations are made by 14alpha and white-light telescopes and a real-time vector-solar ntagnetograph.\nThese instruments support ongoing satellite programs and are used as research\ntools on specific investigative projects both within the Marshall Center and\nin cooperative research with investigators at other institutions. A key element\nin the analysis effort is the Center\'s Image Data processing Facility, a\nhardware/software interactive system that allows the scientist-user to control\nthe application of various restoration, enhancement, and analysis programs,\nwhich are in turn supported by an IBM 360 host computer. Opportunities\nfor research are provided by the above-mentioned theoretical studies and\nground-based facilities and by the SMM, which includes a high-resolution\nultraviolet spectrometer/polarinieter experiment capable of measuring intensities, velocities, and polarization between 1200 and 3000 A. PrincipleInvestigator responsibilities for that instrument and the ongoing data analysis\neffort reside within the Center\'s solar group.\nFluid Dynamics\nW.W. Fowlis 44.70.90.05\nThe fluid-dynamics research conducted in support of the turbulence studies\nis an element of a more extensive program treating the dynamical behavior\n15\n\nt\n\nn ,. t\n"\n\n^b^ it\n\nof fluids. Of particular interest is the behavior in a low-gravity environment.\nA well-equipped laboratory providing capability for sophisticated flow\nvisualization is available for fluid research. Problems currently being most\nintensively investigated havr, arisen either from the requirement to provide\nfundamental support to already approved spaceflight experiments or from\ntheoretically derived results that appear amenable to test through future\nSPACELAB experiments. The program is broadly structured to provide\nsupport to other areas of research requiring specific investigation* in fluid\ndynamics, while also embracing fundamental studies contributing to an\nexpansion of the basic knowledge in the field.\nSeparation and Purification of Biological Materials\n44.70.90.06\n\nR.S. Snvdcr\t\n\nAn opportunity exists to conduct research in the separation and purification\nof biological cells and proteins to develop basic understanding of the separation\nphenomenon. Processes commonly used to isolate and purify biological\nmaterials are not universally satisfactory in producing the resolution or\nquantity needed for biological research or clinical use. Often the technique\nis not sufficiently characterized to permit unequivocal identification and\nquantification of the factors influencing success.\nThe proposed research should plan to analyze the fundamental behavior\n\nof a separation process by theoretical and/or experimental methods. Proposed\nexperimental investigations need not require the low-gravity environment of\nspace.\n\nThe Marshall Space Flight Center\'s current laboratory capability and\n\ninterest are in electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing in both static and\nflowing modes. Experience with other methods and systems is desirable. The\napplicant should have a strong background in biophysics and biochemistry\nand should have laboratory experience in separating biological cells or\nproteins. The Space Science Laboratory\'s program in fluid dynamics is\n\navailable to support this research.\nCrystal Growth of Solid-Solution Semiconductors\n44.70.90.07\n\nS.L. Lchoczky F.R. Szofran\t\n\nResearch is being done to improve the crystal growth of bulk, solid-solution\nsemiconductor materials. Current emphasis is on the growth of mercury\ncadmium telluride by directional solidification methods such as the Bridgman\nmethod. While having a goal of technological significance, the research is\nbroad in scope and fundamental in nature. Basic materials property measurement in both the solid and liquid states are emphasized, and their\nrelationships to material handling and processing methods are investigated.\nThe role of gravity in the crystal-growth process is of particular interest, and\nthe Research Advisors are the Principal Investigator and a Co-Investigator\non an approved spaceflight experiment to investigate that role. Well-equipped\nlaboratories include several types of bulk crystal-growth facilities, electrical\nand metallurgical characterization equipment, electron microscope with energy\n16\n\nW Gtr*\n\ntaiafi,\t\n\n\'\t .\n\n-\n\n^^ ^}I Y\ne\t\n\ndispersive X-ray analyzer, ultrasonic apparatus, transparent furnaces, differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and an\nclectrodeless electrical resistivity measurement system. Computational and\nmodeling efforts are a part of this research and could support any experimental\nwork carried out in the realization of this opportunity.\n1\nSystems Dynamics Laboratory\nG.F. McDonough, Director\nThe Systems Dynamics Laboratory conducts research in aerodynamics,\naerothermodynamics, structural dynamics, vibroacoustic response, control\ntheory, simulation techniques using hybrid and analog computers, and related\nsciences as applied to launch and space vehicles. Experimental programs\n\ninclude jet-plume investigations in launch and orbital environment, vehiclebase heating from multiengine jet plumes, aerodynamic investigations at very\nhigh Reynolds numbers and of cross-flow vortices on bodies of revolution at\nlarge angles of attack, and investigations of aerodynamic and engine noise.\nTheoretical programs of the Laboratory include studies in the following areas\nflight dynamics in atmospheric and exoatmospheric environments, including\nascent, orbital, and entry; active and passive devices for attitude control;\ndynamic-loads analysis; oscillations of partially constrained fluids in tanks\nand other nonlinear vibrational problems; aerodynamics of high and low jet\nplumes, aerodynamics and thermodynamics of spacecraft in hypersonic\nrarefied gas flows; flutter analyses and response of tall vehicles to wind;\nvibroaceustic response techniques; and systems inalysis. including the\ndynami c interaction of subsystems. Support for these research programs is\nprovided by acrothermodynamic lest laboratories that include a bisonic wind\ntunrel, a trisonic wind tunnel, a Ludwieg tube tunnel, a thermoacoustic jet\nlaboratory, a low-density chamber, and a special-impulse base-flow laboratory\nvvnich is used for the study of nozzle flows under actual homing and at\n\naltitude conditions. Theoretical and experimental research is greatly enhanced\nby the ready access to digital, hybrid, and analog computers located at the\ncenter.\nSpace-Vehicle Dynamic-Response Techniques\n44.70.99.01\n\nR. Ryan\t\n\nResponse analysis of dynamic systems presents many interesting and challenging problems in structural modeling, environment prediction, systems\ndescribing equations formulation or simulation, and the statistical treatment\nof the system parameters. The complicating factors are the large number of\n\ndegrees of freedom, extensive sets of system parameters, and the large\nnumber of cases required to insure a design with a quantified probalistics\nstatement. The problem is further aggravated if parameter variation must\ninclude the structural-dynamic modes or if they include interdiscipline effects,\nsuch as structural fluid coupling, control system coupling, and/or structural\n17\n\nA\'\n\n-i\n\nU "il-\n\n^y-\n\nacoustic coupling, This results in an excessively long design-loads cycle\n(roughly one year) and computer costs. Design modes arc therefore not a\npan of systems-verification analysis for approximately one year after incorporation. The objective of this research is to develop modeling techniques\nfor interdiscipline coupling and statistical combination of vehicle parameters\nto reduce substantially the analysis and computer time required to develop\nsets of design duta. Of particular interest will be the application of the\ndeveloped techniques to space-station trade studies.\nRotor-Dynamics Analysis for High-Pressure Pumps of the Space\nShuttle Main Engine\n44.70.99.02\n\nL.A. Schutzenhofer\t\n\nLiquid-propellant rocket engines currently in use or planned by NAS\xe2\x80\x9e require\nhigh-speed turbomachinery to generate the necessary high pressures and flow\nrates. I lexibility of cases and rotors, as well as damping and spring forces\nof bearings and seals, must be considered in the designs. The shaft speed of\nsuch machines typically operates above several criticals caused by flexibility.\nSeveral opportunities for research exist in the turbomachinery-analysis area,\nincluding modeling of nonlinear rotor friction, modeling of hydrodynamic\nforces on impellers, devising mathematical means of reducing and interpreting\nsimulation and test results, designing tests to determine model data and\n\ncoefficients, and further improvement of the damping effect of seals and\nother components.\nFluid Dynamics\n\nG. Fichil 44.70.99.03\nFundamental and applied research opportunities exist for developing extensive\nexperimental, theoretical, and computational programs leading to the development of models and computer codes for use in a wide variety of aerospace\nengineering and geophysical scientific problems. Problems involving fluid\nbehavior under a variety of forces and under low-gravity environments provide\nmany challenging research opportunities. Numerous small- and large-scale\ncomputer facilities are available to support research projects. Full-scale and\nlaboratory support for experimental fluid dynamics studies is also available.\nResearch areas of interest include dynamics of compressible and incompressible liquids and gases, dimensional analysis, dynamic similarity, flow in\npipes and through pumps, rarefied gas aerodynamics, geophysical fluids, and\ncomputational fluid dynamics.\nAtmospheric/Climate Modeling\nW.W. Vaughan R.E. Smith O.E. Smith 44.70.99.04\nResearch includes theoretical and analytical work aimed at developing\nimproved deterministic and statistical models that permit a predictive capability\nof the behavior of the Earth\'s atmosphere with respect to those components\nof behavior having practical engineering applications, e.g., atmospheric\ndensity, pressure, and circulations. Extension of the "standard-atmosphere"\n18\n\nlvfl\'m^\n\nconcept to a global time-dependent model is a current project. Analysis of\nmeteorological satellite data to develop inputs for short- and long-term models\nis an area of emphasis. Extensive files of worldwide atmospheric measurements\nare available.\nSevere-Storms and Mesoscule Research\n11. Christian BJ. Anderson 44.70.99.05\nThe objective is to understand better the atmospheric processes leading to\nthe development of severe-weather phenomena, the role of microphysics, the\nrole of atmospheric electricity, the interrelationship of atmospheric scales of\nmotion, and the role satellite technology can phry in providing both the low-\n\ngravity environment in which to conduct laboratory experiments and more\nmeaningful observations and measurements. Satellite remote-sensing data,\ncombined with correlative ground-truth experiments, provide the basis for\nsome of this research. Research involves theoretical, analytical, and experimental work, both in the laboratory and in large-scale field experiments/\nactivities. Thermal diffusion chambers, aerosol generators, humidifiers, and\nancillary laboratory equipment are available. Research involves thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, atmospheric electricity, mathematics, probability\ntheory, cloud microphysics, and atmospheric physics disciplines.\nLarge-Scule Atmospheric Circulation and Dynamics\nG.H. Fichtl F. Leslie 44.70.99.06\nThis research is concerned with fundamental dynamic problems of the Earth\'s\natmosphere, ranging from planetary to frontal scales. Much of the research\ncenters around the design of it spherical baroclinic experimental model of\nthe large-scale atmospheric circulation that has been proposed for SPACELAB\nfights, This model uses a radial dielectric polarization body force to simulate\ngravity. (It must be operated in the low-gravity environment of an orbiting\nvehicle, because the dielectric force is weak and would be overwhelmed by\ngravity on the Earth\'s surface.) In order to design this model to investigate\nprecise scientific questions, a considerable number of theoretical, numerical,\nand experimental problems have to be tackled. This work builds on previous\nwork with laboratory cylindrical-annulus experiments. Fundamental dynamic\nquestions based on quasigeostrophic and semigeostrophic theory and nonlinear\ninteractions are being studied. A computer general-circulation model is being\nsimplified to match the parameters of the SPACELAB experiment.\n\ni\n\n`,\t\nt\t\n\t\n\nu\nt\t\n\nTurbulence and Atmospheric Dynamics\nG.H. Fichtl D.W.
