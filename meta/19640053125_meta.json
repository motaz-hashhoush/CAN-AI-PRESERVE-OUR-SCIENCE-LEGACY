However, in the near future, emphasis is being placed primarily on long wavelength radio astronomy and, particularly, on astronomical photometry and spectroscopy in the portion of the spectrum to the violet of 3000 Angstrom. It is these regions which are most completely cut off from observations from the earth's surface and, in addition, it is in the far ultraviolet wavelength region that many astrophysically important lines are found.", "title": "Nasa Plans Report", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-02T03:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19640053125, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Roman, Nancy G."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "d12dfee80fd9416db4653b219ce918ac"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19640053125, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19640053125, "id": "71ac35da7f254a0f98caeb90c901bc84", "publicationDate": "1961-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
