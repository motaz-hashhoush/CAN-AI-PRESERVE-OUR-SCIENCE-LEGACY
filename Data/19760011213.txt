NASA asked\nz that the study also consider how these applications would influence or be\ninfluenced by the Space Shuttle System, the principal space transportation\nsystem of the 1980 1 s. In December 1973, the Academq^ agreed to perform the\nstudy and assigned the task to the Space Applications Board (SAB).\nIn the summers of 1967 and 1968, the Nationa ls Academy of Sciences had\nconvened a group of eminent scientists and engineers to determine what research\nand development was necessary to permit \'the exploitation of useful applications\nof earth-oriented satellites. The SAB concluded that since the NAS study,\noperational weather and communications satellites and the successful first\nyear of use of the experimental Earth Resources Technology Satellite had demonstrated conclusively a technological capability that could form a foundation\nfor expanding the useful applications of space-derived information and services,\nand that it was now necessary to obtain, from a broad cross-section of potential\nusers, new ideas and needs that might guide the development of future space\n\nsystems for practical applications.\nAfter discussions with NASA and other interested federal agencies, it\nwas agreed that a major aim of the "summer study" should be to involve, and\nto attempt to understand the needs of, resource managers and other decisionmakers who had as yet only considered space systems as experimental rather\nthan as useful elements of major day-to-day operational information and service\nsystems. Under the general direction of the SAB, then, a representative group\nof users and potential users conducted an intensive two-week study to define\nuser needs that might be met by information or services derived from earth\norbiting satellites. This work was done in July 1974 at Snowmass, Colorado.\nFor the study, nine user-oriented panels were formed, comprised of present\nor potential public and private users, including businessmen, state and local\ngovernment officials, resource managers, and other decision-Makers. A. number\n\n*Effective July 1, 1974, the National Academy of Sciences and the National\nAcademy of Engineering reorganized the National Research Council into eight\nassemblies and commissions. All National Academy of Engineering program units,\nincluding the SAB, became the Assembly of Engineering,\nr\n\na;\t\n\n.\n\nI\na\n\ni\n\nof scientists and technologists also participated, functioning essentially\nas expert consultants. The assignment made to the panels included reviewing\nprogress in space applications since the NAS study of 1968* and defining user\nneeds potentially capable of being met by space-system applications.

The function\nof the SAB was to review the work of the panels, to evaluate their findings,\nand to derive from their work an integrated set of major conclusions and recommendations. The Board\'s findings, which include certain significant recommendations from the panel reports, as well as more general ones arrived at by\nconsidering the work of the study as a whole ; dre contained in a report prepared by the Board.**\nIt should be emphasized that the study was not designed to make detailed\nassessments of all of the factors which should be considered in establishing\npriorities.

In some cases, analyses of costs and benefits will be\nneeded. In this connection, specific cost-benefit studies were not conducted\nas a part of the two-week study. Recommendations for certain such analyses,\nhowever, appear in the Board\'s report, together with recommendations designed\nto provide an improved basis upon which to make cost-benefit assessments.\nIn sum, the study was designed to provide an.opportunity for knowledgeable\nand experienced users, expert in \'their fields, to express their needs for\ninformation or services which might (or might not) be met by space systems,\nand to relate the present and potential capabilities of space systems to their\nneeds. The study did not attempt to examine in detail the scientific, technical, or economic bases for the needs expressed by the users.\n\nThe SAB was impressed by the duality of the panels\' work and has asked\nthat their reports be made available as supporting documents for the Board\'s\nreport.

In addition the Panel considered useful services which\nmay be provided by future satellite communications systems.\nMany of the recommendations of the 1967-68 study have been accomplished.\nThe commercial utilization of satellite communications systems for conventional\ncommunications services, such as those normally provided by U.S. common carriers,\nhas been exemplified to date by five generations of satellites developed by the\nInternational Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (INTELSAT), by the development of satellites for domestic trunk services and by the initiation of work on\na maritime satellite. While these advances in satellite communication systems\nduring their first decade have been important, a growing appreciation of communications needs, coupled with rapid potential advances in technology, portends an\neven greater impact of satellite communications between now and the end of the\ntwentieth century.\n\nBasic technology for the first decade of satellite communication systems was\ndeveloped and successfully demonstrated in the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) programs involving SYNCOM and the Applications Technology\nSatellites ATS-1 to ATS-S. The Interim Defense Communications Satellite Program\nand the American Telephone and Telegraph Company\'s TELSTAR also made important\ncontributions. Because the level of investment risk had thus been explored and\ndemonstrated to be acceptable, commercial exploitation readily followed, brought\ndirect benefits and resulted in U.S. leadership in international markets related\nto satellite communication systems and associated ground equipment.\nSeveral important recommendations of the 1967--68 study are still in piocess\nof implementation. These include ise of multi-channel distribution satellite\nsystems for domestic communications and exploration of the possible benefits of\nusing television with two-way voice communication in the fields of education and\nhealth and in information distribution to sparsely populated areas.\n\ni\n\n*National Research Council-.

Such services include\nimprovement in the transmission of information; provision of greater safety to\npersons and craft at sea, on land, or in the air; location of those in distress;\nand warning of impending natural disasters. Recommendations are made with regard\nto mobile communications for use on land and at sea, position determinatipn,\nmineral and energy exploration, the possibility of using electronic means to\nassist in mail delivery, education and health-care experiments, and the use of\nsatellite telecommunications to enhance the quality of life in rural areas by\nmaking available a full range of educational and entertainment.programs. Because\nof the widespread interest in amateur radio services, and because amateur radio\nperforms a public service in times of emergencies, the Panel took into consideration the needs of the amateur radio community to have placed in orbit satellites\nwhich it might build.\nA number of other useful services appear possible, for which additional\nstudy is needed to assess potential benefits and to consider under what institutional arrangements these services might be provided. It must be emphasized that\neach service does not require its own separate satellite; rather, a few satellites\ncould provide most or all of the services envisioned. Concepts of several such\nexperimental satellite communication systems, which could demonstrate passible \t\nnew services to potential users, are presented in appendices to this report.\n\nservices and\n\n*Panel on Marine and Maritime Uses.

Q\n\n3\n\n3\n\nj\n\nNEEDS FOR LAND MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS\n\nThere is a large unmet demand for land mobile communications in business,\nand industry and for personal use. Nearly half a million applications for\nlicenses to operate communications services are filed each year in the U.S. Many\nlicensees operate several.mobi.le terminals. At present mobile services are provided in the VHF and UHF bands where antenna size and propagation losses do not\nlimit performance. However, at these frequencies the bands available for mobile\ncommunications are crowded, and there is a severe shortage of spectrum availability. In the centimeter wavelength region of the spectrum, many channels can be\nprovided but technological and environmental difficulties are encountered with\nantenna size, attenuation caused by rough terrain, reflections from physical\nstructures and the atmosphere. These limitations maybe mitigated by use of\nsatellites which radiate sufficient radio frequency power and have antennas of\nsufficient size to permit communications with small low-power mobile units in\nindustrial and metropolitan areas. Preliminary calculations indicate that 1-watt\nmobile units, working with a 1000-channel narrow -beam satellite transponder using\n1 watt per channel., could provide services which are superior in performance and\ncomparable in cost to those provided by present systems. Some advances in technology would be needed.\nThe PaneZ recommends that NASA, in coticboration with the\nelectronics industry, explore the feasibilitrg and the cost of\nproviding mobile cen.timeter-wavelength . satellite communications\nservices within large metropolitarz areas of the U.S.\n\n3\n\nNEEDS OF THE MARINE AND MARITIME COMMUNITY\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nMore than 90 percent of present-day ship-to-shore communications are sent\nby an operator using a telegraph key and the International Morse Code. The transmissions utilize medium or high radio frequencies and are subject to interference\nand ionospheric disturbances. delays of hours and even days are frequently experienced in the transmission of a message between a shipping company office and a\n\nship.\nModern vessels represent large capita\' investments and their operating casts\nare high. Improved communications may provide substantial benefits arising from\nmore efficient ship operations and better fleet management. In a recent experiment*, voice, teletype, facsimile and slow-scan television communications, as\nwell as position fixing, were provided by satellite daily over a period of\n7 months to a 32,000-ton tanker in service between Venezuela and ports on the\nU.S. east coast. The shipping company concluded that the satellite service\noffered communications capability better than any presently available to the\nmaritime industry, and that this improved communications could offer significant\nbenefits in the form of improved efficiency of ship operations and management.\nIn this particular experiment, teletype service was judged to make the\ngreatest contribution to ship operating efficiency. Voice service was found very\nuseful, facsimile somewhat less so and slow-scan television was found to have\nlimited usefulness. . It was estimated that if an operational marine satellite communication system providing teletype and voice service were available, this\nparticular ship could be expected to utilize the teletype service about two minutes per day and the voice service about five minutes per day. If facsimile serVice were also provided ., teletype use would decrease to one and one-half minutes.\nper day and facsimile service would be used about four and one-half minutes per\nday. Although this experience comes from only one specific type of ship, it is\nbelieved the results are representative of the type and daily amount of communications required by ships generally. If equipment and operating costs can be\nkept sufficiently low, satellite communications might result in substantial savings\n\n*LaRosa, R.M.; Furick, J. W.; King, D.W.; Anderson, R.

COMSAT plans to launch a maritime communications satellite called\nMARISAT in mid-1975. Primarily intended for use by the U.S. Navy, it will have\n20 teletype channels and one voice channel available to commercial shipping.\nThe Eur ,)pean Space Research Organ i zation (ESRO, now the European Space Agency)\nis preparing a maritime communications satellite (MAROTS) for launch late in\n1977. An international conference will be held in mid-1975 to begin work toward an operational international maritime satellite communications system.\n\nPOSITION DETERMINATION\n\n_\t\n\nAs pointed out by the Panel on Marine and Maritime Uses, there exists a\nnumber of ground-based radiowav, position-determination systems, including KORAN-A\n(being replaced by LORAN-C), DECCA, and OMEGA. None of the ground-based systems\ncurrently provide global coverage because the many land-based terminals needed\nfor such coverage have not been installed. A Navy satellite navigation system\n(TRANSIT), available for civil use, provides global coverage but its accuracy is\nlimited to about one-half mile and the procedure for using it is complicated and\nrequires relatively costly shipboard equipment. The Department of Defense (DOD)\nis planning a satellite system (the Global Positioning System or NAVSTAR) which\nwill permit highly precise position fixing, including determination of altitude.\nThe Panel understands that it is the present intent of DOD to make NAVSTAR available for civil use. However, the Panel considers it unlikely that \'the on-board\nequipment requixed to use the system would be sufficiently low in cost to permit\nvery wide use by the marine community.\nThe existence of several ground-based regional position determination systems\nresults in a dissipation of public and private funds, necessitates carrying aboard\nships and aircraft different devices for navigating in various parts of the world,\n\n*B.

The Panel on Marine and Maritime Uses would like to see existing\nregional systems replaced by a unified and continuously available position determination system of sufficient accuracy (200 m) for maritime navigation in the high\nseas and in confluence regions. As a goal, such a system should be comparable\nwith ar less costly to operate than the present aggregate of systems, and the\nassociated mobile receiving equipment should be economical for the user to lease\nor own. Such a position determination system providing coverage between about\n75\xc2\xb0 N or 75 0 S latitude could also be of benefit for ship movement advisory services, for maritime traffic control and for uses other than maritime shipping.\nThe Panel on Marine and Maritime Uses has estimated that on a typical transatlantic crossing, a 93 km (50 n. mi) saving could result from improved space-based navigation and routing services, and would save 100 barrels of oil per\ntrip. At $11 per barrel for 6 annual round trips for each of the 570 U.S, flag\nships, the gross saving would amount to $7.4 million. In the future, a 10 percent\nsaving in time resulting from improved routing for 200,000-ton tankers at $36,500\nper ship per day would amount to a gross saving of $525 million for the approximately 400 tankers which (as of June 1974) it is estimated will be needed to\ndeliver oil to the U.S. in 1985.\nThe Panel concludes that satellite communications and position determination\ncapability should be provided around the globe at an early date in the latitudes\npresently used by merchant shipping and should be extended to polar regions by\nthe 1980\'s. The present partially suitable and costly regional navigation systems\nshould be replaced if possible by one widely useful system, inexpensive to use,\nwhich may be integrated with the communications system. A large number of shipboard terminals will be needed. To make them less costly and less complex, there\nis a need for increased emphasis on research and development on spacecraft antennas, on power sources, and on more efficient modulation techniques. It should be\nnoted that the space portion of such future satellite communications and navigation systems may be incorporated in spacecraft which also serve other purposes.\nIt may also be desirable to provide capability for the system to collect data from\nsensors aboard ships -- for example, data on weather, on the behavior of the\nocean or possibly even research data on the structural behavior of the ships.\nThe Panel believes that the needs for marine communications and position\nfixing could, for the most part, be met by using presently available technology.\nAdditional research and development is needed, however, to permit selection of\ntechniques and definition of specifications for low-cost operational systems.\nResearch and development on highly reliable minimum-cost equipment is in progress\nand should be continued. Industry should be primarily responsible for such\nresearch and development, with some participation by NASA, the Maritime\nAdministration and maritime users.\n\nrecommended that NASA\'s internal R&D program and the R&D\nprogram whick NASA sponsors in indusfrV continue to emphasize Zowcost techniques appZicable to the needs of maritime community for\nsatellite communications and position determination. It is also\nrecommended that MARAD continue to coordinate national activities\naimed toward providing a single Zow-cost satellite maritime commun,cations and position determination system.\nIt is\n\n7\n\n1\n\ni\n\nk\n\nf\n\nNEEDS OF THE MINERAL AND ENERGY EXPLORATION COMMUNITY\n\nThe extractable resources industry serves a market of $32 billion in providing raw materials and $150 billion in processed materials and energy each year.\nE,,ploration for new sources costs from $40,000 to over $1 million per site. With\na market of this size and at these costs, exploration crews must be as efficient\nas possible. According to the Panel on Extractable Resources, mineral exploration teams require position determination accurate to 30 meters in remote locations all over the world. They will need an accuracy of + 15 m in the 1980\'s.\nBy the 1980\'s data transmission at a rate of 10 million bits per second will be\nneeded to send data (for example, seismic data) for processing at a central\nlocation.\nSatellite communications and position-fixing systems can potentially meet\nthese needs especially in remote regions of the earth. To meet the accuracy and\nhigh data rate requirements, some research is needed to better establish the\nfundamental limitations on measurement imposed by propagation effects and the\naccuracy with which the position of satellites can be determined. To achieve\nhigh accuracy; further development of techniques for controlling the attitude of\nspacecraft is needed. The service must be usable with man-transportable\ntransmitter-receivers of relatively low cost. To establish the limits imposed on\naccuracy by propagation requires measurement of propagation delay effects in the\nionosphere and troposphere, Faraday rotation, and tropospheric refraction. The\nmeasurement techniques involved require coherent transmissions from at least\nthree widely separated frequencies from a spacecraft. ATS-6 is the only satellite\npresently in orbit that can provide the coherent multiple frequency transmissions.\nThe PaneZ on Uses of Communications recommends that NASA, in\ncooperation with other federaZ agencies as appropriate, perform the technicaZ research and development needed for\nimproving the accuracy of electromagnetic position determination techniques.\nA few systems for multiple use should be adequate if the programs are\nintegrated with other applications. At the present time, however, there is no\ninstitutional mechanism by which such .common use of systems can be arranged.\nThe Panel recommends that the federaZ goverment take the \t\ninitiative to examine the combined communications and position\ndetermination needs of the extractive industries and the maritime community, and determine the possibility of designing an\n9\n\nj\n\nELECTRONIC MESSAGE HANDLING\n\nThe volume of mail in the United States is growing at a rate that creates\nmajor problems in delivering mail expeditiously and inexpensively.. A great part\nof the mail involves commercial or routinely printed messages that do not require\nprivacy. Many of these messages could be sent from one postal center to another\nby electronic means, particularly when long distances are involved. Electronic\nmessage. delivery could also have implications in education.-- . for example, in the\nexchange of library materials, the distribution of instructional materials and\nnewsletters.\nThe U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is examining the possibility of an economically feasible and marketable electronic message. system. In the course of this preliminary system definition study, market research necessary to make a judgment\non whether customers want and are willing to pay for this kind of service will be\naccomplished. In the study, systems using satellite communications, as well as\nterrestrial. communications links, are being considered. If the results . of the\nrable, a decision could be made to proceed with developprelim\ninary study are favo\nment and testing of equipment. This later phase would be completed during fiscal\nyear 1979. If it is decided to proceed with a system, it is envisioned that it\ncould.be in . operation sometime :about 1985..\nOperation could begin with a relatively simple system which could evolve to\nmore and more automation over a period of time. In the early stages, paper-mail\ninput to an electronic message center might be converted to electronic form by\noptical-character readers, by graphic scanning, or possibly by a..combination of\nboth techniques. Many of the messages suitable for electronic transmission would\nbe expected to originate as business information (for example, bills and invoices)\nalready on electronic tapes and stored in computers. These could be transmitted\nto electronic message stations by telephone lines or cable or the tapes might\'be\ntransported to the centers. Business correspondence also could be transmitted\nelectronically, since such messages are usually typed and may he put directly\ninto electronic form by keyboard-to-tape conversion or by graphical.-facsimile\nconversion. Messages destined for distant stations could be transmitted over\ncommon-carrier communications networks to destination stations where, still in\nelectronic form, they could be merged and processed with mail for local\n\ndzs.^rzbut^.on.\nElectronic message centers mi ght evolve as switching centers which could\nroute messages electronically to local post offices for conversion, to hard copy\nfor delivery. If terminals sufficiently low in`cost can be developed, local\npost offices also might be able then to switch messages, also.electronically,\n11\n\n{\ni\n\n;a\n3\n\n1\n\nto a home or place of business for printout on a remote printer. Eventually it\nmay be possible . for messages to be transmitted from or received on a terminal at\na home or place of business. Thus, messages not requiring privacy would exist\nonly in electronic form within the system and would appear as hard copy only at\ninput and output points.\nNonbusiness messages.originating with individuals could also be sent through\nan electronic system. The procedure could be handled using kiosks located in\nshopping centers, airports, and post-office lobbies. The kiosks, 0 4 ch would\nbe somewhat like telephone booths, could contain graphic--conversion terminals\nconnected to the electronic message center. Provision could be made for protecting the privacy of communication where it is appropriate.\nUSPS is being assisted in the preliminary system definition, now under way,\nby the National Bureau of Standards, the Naval Electronics Laboratory, and the\nOffice. of Telecommunications of the Department of Commerce..\nThe Panel estimates that as much as one-third of today\'s first-class mail\nis generated by electronic devices. It seems clear that with the increase which\nmust be expected in the volume of mail, a projection of present practices for\nhandling mail cannot provide either the expeditious postal service that business\nand the public desire or an economically self-sufficient postal service.\nThe Panel believes that technologies in communications, input-output devices,\ncomputers and information processing memories will be sufficiently advanced to\nimplement an electronic message handling system in accordance with the schedule\ncurrently contemplated by USPS. What remains to be established is whether the\npublic needs (or wants) an electronic message handling system, and if so, who\nshould provide it. At present, no organization other than USPS exists with the\ncapability of collecting, handling, and delivering today\'s volume of mail nor.\nwith the potential capability of implementing on a national scale a system of\n"hard-copy" electronic message handling centers. In the Panel\'s vew, the\ncommercial opportunities are too great for this market to persist as one to be\nserved solely by the USPS. The Panel believes that the USPS should take the\ninitiative in helping to provide a nationwide electronic message handling service, and that the USPS should help seek modifications in the statutes governing\nprivate--sector message services so that others may enter the market.\nSatellites already existing or planned, such as the Communications\nTechnology Satellite (CTS) or the ATS series, should be used to assess the usefulness of a satellite in an electronic message handling system.\nThe Panel recommends that the U.S. Postal Service, when and\nwhere required, use the assistance of other federal agencies\nin the definition and planning of an electronic message\n\nsystem.\n\n12\n\nNEEDS IN EDUCATION\n\nGreater public access to educational services is needed. A need for continuing professional education in the home or business office was identified aiad\njudged to be important by the 1967-68 summer study\'s Panel on Broadcasting.*\nMany segments of the population need special communications services and satellite\ntechnology may make substantial contributions to meeting these needs. Examples\nare the alleviation of adult illiteracy and the supplementing of high school,\ncommunity college, and 4-year college courses with high-level audiovisual materials. Interactive terminals could be used in the future, perhaps opening the way\nfor as yet unthought of means of education.\nAn example of an important problem which can be ameliorated is that of continuing professional education. About 2 million professionals in the U.S. today\n(for example, educators, attorneys, engineers, and physicians) are faced with a\ncontinuous need to update their education. Some states already require that\npersons in the medical and dental professions re-establish their competence\nthrough periodic retraining.\nIf only 25 percent of the 2 million professionals spent $200 a year for TV\neducational services, the revenue would be $100 million a.year. That amount\nshould be more than adequate to amortize investments and to pay for the educational software. A 4-channel satellite of a size and weight which could be launched\nby the Titan III launch vehicle could be designed to broadcast directly to home\nreceivers. (A conceptual design for.such a system is presented in Appendix B..)\nThe 2.5 GHz equipment already demonstrated experimentally by ATS-6 and its\nassociated surface terminals could be used. Home installations would need a TV\nreceiver, a roof-top antenna 1 meter in diameter, and a frequency converter.\nUltimately a 12 GHz 12 channel system might be used to satisfy this need as well\nas for a wide variety of other purposes such as rural. TV, teleculture, and telemedicine. (See Appendix B.) Educational material, broadcast for various professions could be viewed in real time . by subscribers or could be recorded on video\ntape for subsequent viewing. The system could also be used for public broadcasting, educational material distribution, and possibly interactive links. Users\nof the initial 2.5 GHz band would retain the basic TV set and video-tape recorder\nand would need a new converter and new antenna to operate on the 12 GHz band..\n\nj\t\n\n*Report of the PaneZ on Broadcasting (Panel 10) , 1969.\n13\n\ni1t ,\n\n3\n^\n\nf\n\ni\n\ns\n\ni\n\nThe Panel notes that the Department of Health, Education, and Welfaresponsored Health and Education Telecommunications (HET) satellite demonstrations\nhave shown the feasibility of delivering education services over wide geographic\nareas. However, personnel from all of the.educational institutions Lust be\nfanning and into research and dev p ment efforts if satellite comelo\nbrou g ht into p\nmunications are to be accepted in the education process. The roles of educational\ninstitutions and personnel associated with the institutions will have to be\nreassessed if communications satellites are utilized. In the past, educational\ninstitutions and educators have been reluctant to begin to use new technology.\nThe success of efforts to improve education is directly related to the\nquality of the instructional package which includes pretaped and five broadcasting, data transmission, materials distribution, and interactive links. A closed\ncircuit channel may be required for educating and re-educating physicians, nurses, \t\netc. This channel should also have two-way video transmission to permit diagnosis\nof. medical problems of patients as well as diagnosis of educational problems of\nhandicapped children.\n\nI\n\nNEEDS IN HEALTH CARE\n\nEqual access to health care service is not available for all segments of the\npopulation and this problem is receiving increased attention. Inequitable distribution of medical resources will probably persist even if the number of\nphysicians increases. As a result, in recent years considerable interest has\narisen, in the possible use of telemedicine systems as vehicles for improving access\nto.high quality medical care. Telemedicine systems would be employed in hierarchical organizations of health care in which the physician and patient are\nseparated geographically and these interactions take place over a communication\nlank. In general, such systems include the following components:\nA medical center where medical expertise and diagnostic and\ntherapeutic technology and data are concentrated;\nRemote terminals where health professionals or paramedical\npersonnel -- who may be located at a. fixed site such as a\nclinic, a village or other remote populated areas - may enter\nthe system;\nA communications link between the remote ter1ftinals and the\nmedical center;\nA transportation system for use when movement of a patient\na central treatment point is indicated.\n\nto\n\nFor some purposes, telemedical systems would.use wide band communications\nchannels. For example, real -time video seems essential for such functions as.\nremote supervision of anesthesia, speech therapy, orthopedic examination and\n\ncertain critical procedures. Remote radiographic interpretation may be done with\nslow-scan video systems but there may be an accompanying high cost in professional\ntime and frustration. Continuous two -way wide -band communication is probably not e\nnecessary; perhaps the best arrangement is one in which a continuous, two-way\nnarrow -band channel is provided, supplemented by wide-hand transmission capacity\nas needed. Such additional capacity could be supplied by a.satell.ite link which\nwould be made available on a priority basis. Such a system would require sop hi.sticated flexible ground terminal equipment and central data management capability:\nIts advantage is that the wide-band portion of the system would not require eatensive fixed ground- based communications links.\n15\n\n1\t\n\nJ\nai\n\n\t\ni\nI\n\n`\t\n\ni\t\n\nTelemedicine systems have their greatest applicability in rural regions\nwhere conventional land-based communications are inadequate or not reliable (for\nexample, in Alaska, Appalachia, the Rocky Mountain area and some developing\ncountries). In such regions, satellite - munications may be the cheapest alternative for providing needed health care. Experience in experimental telemedicine\nsystems has shown that for most primary care settings, narrow-band channels pro-vide adequate communications between physicians in hospitals or clinics and\nreasonably sophisticated health professionals in a remote area. Such channels\ncan support both consultations and transmission of medical data (for example,\nmedical records and protocols). Experience in Alaska has shown that very significant improvement in health care occurs when reliable two-way audio communications\nare provided between hospitals and remote villages. High priority should be\ngiven to providing the reliable communication on a continuing basis.\ncontinuation of the current series of Health and Education.Telecommunications\n(HET) experiments on ATS-6 has great value in determining the viability of postulated services. However, after only 9 months of the experiments ATS-6 was\nmoved to serve another commitment. Nine months is not sufficient time to assess\nthe complex social and institutional changes which are involved in . experiments\nof this type. Services provided by ATS-6 are currently perceived as valuable by\nusers served. Termination of the HET program without a plan for follow--up can\nlead to premature abandonment of a potentially valuable concept and a waste of\nthe federal-and regional investment to date.\n\nf\n\nThe Panel recommends that NASA complete and launch AC\'S-F ` by\nthe time ATS-6 is moved to India so that vltaZ U.S. experiments\nin education and health care can continue uninterrupted.*\n\ni\ns\n\nIn July 1974; when-:the Paned completed- deliberation; this option was still open: .\nATS-F I was the back-up or contingency spacecraft for ATS-F which, when launched,\nwas redesignated ATS --6 This possibility of launching ATS-F\' has been foreclosed\nby termination of the program . and "mothballing" of the uncompleted satellite.\nThe Panel still believes and recommends that federal,- state; and private support\n.should be made available to permit completion of HET experiments.\t\n\ni\nj\n\nOTHER POTENTIAL SERVICES\n\nThe Panel has examined a number of services which might be provided through\nthe use of satellite communications. Certain of these services appear to offer\nsubstantial potential benefits to the public, and the Panel balieves they warrant\nfurther study. The most significant are search and rescue, disaster warning,\ndissemination of time and frequency standards, provision of TV and teleculture to\nrural areas, collection of data on environment and resources, and wildlife\nmonitoring.\nThe Panel has not dealt in this report with conventional ground-based communications to meet the needs of business and government because the markets for\nsuch services are readily perceived and it is reasonable to assume that private\nenterprise will move into the markets as they Hocome apparent. It should be\nnoted, however, that studies and experiments are being made, some by government\nagencies and others sponsored by government agencies, relative to the substitution\nof communications for travel. Many of the techniques being considered involve\ntelevision, and satellite communications may be competitive with terrestrial systems in providing the service needed.\nSEARCH AND RESCUE\nInternational agreements provide for search for and rescue of survivors of\naccidents at sea that involve aircraft and ships or boats. The U.S. Coast Guard\n(USCG) is the lead agency for U.S. participation in such efforts. The USCG is\nassisted by other federal agencies as appropriate and by many state and local\nagencies when needed.\nMost search activities are conducted visually from ships and aircraft.\nEffective communication and location by radio can. increase the speed, probability\nof success, and efficiency of Search and Rescue (SAR) parties. However, currently\navailable radio communications are subject to propagation disturbances and interference, and radio location methods are not unified. Furthermore, geographical\nbarriers such. as mountains and . large expanses of territo.ry .inhib.it the satisfactory reception of radio signals at some SAR stations as well as in SAR operations.\nThese deficiencies prevent the implementation of a reliable worldwide search and\nrescue system based on terrestrial radio.\nBecause-of the kind of communications and position de.texmination.re .quired\nand because of the global magnitude of the SAR function, the Panel feels that\nearth- oriented satellites can play \'a useful role therein. The USCG estimates\n\ni\n\n1.7\ny,3\n\nthat 400 laves would be saved at sea each year* by the use of satellites to aid\nSAR. In addition, every year a number of private aircraft downed in mountain or\nwilderness areas are not found for days or even months., Thus, prompt location\nand assistance could save much suffering and many laves on land and at sea.\nImproving SAR operations through the use of satellite systems was included as an\nurgent need in the 1967-68.study.report of the Panel on Navigation and Traffic\nControl.** The problem has not been acted on as recommended. The present Panel\nagain concludes that the use of satellites to assist in search and rescue operations be given urgent attention.\nThe use of satellites for SAR would involve the use of small electronic packages which could be turned on, either manually or automatically, when someone is\nin need of help and which transmit signals via satellite relay to a ground control\ncenter. The transmitted signals could provide information on position and on the\nnature of the problem. The control center..can then transmit an acknowledgment..\nsignal through satellites to advise that the request for help has been heard.\nSeveral experiments have proven the technical feasibility of using satellites\nin SAR. The Global Rescue and Alarm Network, which is based on the NASA Orbital\nPosition Location Experiment system, receives OMEGA position signals at very low.\nradio frequencies (VLF) and relays them through a communication satellite to a\nshore-based monitoring center. The center identifies the party in distress, computes its location, and initiates search and rescue activities. Other experiments\nhave shown that signals from low-power hand-held transmitters can be received.by\nand relayed through geostationary satellites. In one experiment,. a simple collapsible helical antenna weighing approximately 1.4 kg (built on the skeleton of a\ngolfers umbrella) was used with a small commercially available 5-watt transceiver\nto relay two-way voice and telegraph signals through the very high frequency\ntransponder of ATS-3. It has been shown that the device can transmit telegraph\nsignals through the satellite transponder even though the same satellite transponder is simultaneously relaying a signal from a powerful ground station. The\nexperiment suggests that it may be possible to design a. search and rescue system\nwhich would include user equipment to be carried routinely and an existing satellite transponder normally used for other purposes (that is, not dedicated to SAR).\nAn appropriate-ground-based receiving facility would be required.\nThe responsibility for designing, implementing and operating a SAR system\nwould appear to be the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Transportation\n(DOT), of which the Coast Guard is a part. NASA can assist by providing technical\nadvice, assistance with system definition, and experimental links through existing satellites. The Panel believes that \'once the implementation of a standard\nsystem is assured, the electronics industry will perceive a market and design and\nbuild transceivers for the users.\n\nThe Panel recormriends that DOT initiate a study of a sate Z\'Zitebased search and rescue system with a viers to determining if\nthe benefits of such a system make it advisable to begin its\n\n*Baker, dames L.: Satellites for Maritime Applicattions.

The Panel further recommends\nthat NASA assist by providing experimental links through exist -\n\ndefinition and\n\ning satellites.\n\nDISASTER WARNING\nEarly warning of natural disasters could permit taking emergency steps to\nlessen their impact and possibly to save many lives. Technology is available to\nimplement a disaster warning system. The Panel believes. that industry can be\nexpected to develop low cost audiovisual indicators and ground receivers when a\nstandard system is demonstrated and its utility is assured.\nUse of satellites for disaster warning requires installation of electronic\ndevices in homes.and-places of business which can receive warning signals broadcast from satellites. Events that warrant . transmission of warnings include severe\nstorms, floods, fires, accidental release of hazardous materials (as from a truck,\nbarge, tank car, or pipeline), and civil-defense emergencies. Upon receipt of the\nwarning; one would tune too- prearranged radio station to receive information on\nthe nature of the disaster and recommended precautions.\nAlternatively, the disaster-warningsystem could use receivers at local power\nsubstations or telephone exchanges which would then relay the signal on utility\nlines to homes. The satellite warning transmission could be coded to alert only\nthe affected geographical area.\n\nt\n\nSince there does not appear to be a single governmental agency\nresponsble for the design and implementation o,; a disaster.-warning system, the Panel recommends (1) that the Office of\nPreparedness of the General Services Administration be assigned\n\nleadership responsibility for implementation of the proposed systhat NASA provide the satellite portion of the system,\t\nand (3) that other government agencies such as the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric A&ninistration and the Department of\nTranaportation.be given responsibility for implementation and\noperation of systems to collect and analyze the information\nrequired and to define the civaumstances under which a warning\nshould be issued.\n\ntem, (2)\n\nTIME AND FREQUENCY STANDARDS\nSeveral nations transmit time signals and standard frequencies by groundbased radio.. The irthereit nature :of.the prop agation . .proc.es.s.by which radio\nsignals reach a distant receiver is such that signals are distorted or suffer\nvariable delays much of the time, limiting their usefulness. Transmission of\nsignals by satellites using line-of--sight paths could: greatly relieve such distorLions of received signals, provide reliable reception in.regions where signals\nmay now be poorly received and thus add new uses for the service. Service could\n- be provided in two frequency bands:: one for general use at a frequency that can\nbe received on conventional home FM receivers; the other at a higher frequency\nfor users with stringent requirements and sophisticated .equipmenta:\nAircraft collision avoidance systems requiring high.-stability and highaccuracy frequency sources for time determination are under study by several\n19\n\n4\n\n{\n\norganizations. Using a satellite for dissemination of time and frequency Standards, if the required accuracy can be provided, could eliminate the need for\natomic clocks (at a cost of $10 thousand to $15 thousand each) to be. carried on\neach aircraft. The Panel estimates that for military aircraft and for domestic\nairlines this gross saving could amount to $100 million.\nA single geostationary satellite could provide to users in the western hemisphere time signals, accurate to within a few microseconds, as well as frequency\nand relative time to an accuracy of the order of one part in 10 10 . A higherfrequency service at C-band with suitable, modulation could provide ervice to an\naccuracy of the order of ten nanosei:onds in time and one part in 13 in frequency.\nIf satellites in low earth orbits . (which do not stay constantly above the same\nregion of the earth) were employed, users who require high accuracy would need\nknowledge of satellite position and motion relative to the earth\'s surface and\nsome sophisticated equipment to correct for errors caused by the Doppler effect.\nThe VHF satellite may be additionally useful when environmental, propagation, or\nother scientific data and information are transmitted by teletype or by voice and\ninterspersed with time signals as is now the case with U.S. and Canadian HF\nsystems.\nThe National Bureau of Standards has transmitted time signals through ATS^3\nand is currently transmitting time signals experimentally through the Synchronous\nMeteorological Satellite and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite\n(GOES). The experiments \':ave demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of\nthis \'type of service. Some research is needed to determine the most useful\nform of signals because satellite service will allow uses that are not possible\nwith current terrestrially propagated sez^Tires. It appears to the Panel that\nthe research and system development required should be the responsibility of.\nthe National Bureau of Standards and the U.S. Naval Observatory.\n\nThe Panel recommends careful study of the possibilities of\ndisseminating accurate time and frequency signals by satellite.\nThe National Bureau of Standards and the U.S. Naval Observatoxy\nshould be given the responsibility to carry out this task with\neoZlaboration from NASA as needed.\nRURAL TV AND TELECULTUkE\nUrban,.rural; and energy problems are interdependent. Making the rural U.S.\nattractive to more people as a place to live and to work should help to solve the\nproblems. Delivery of vocational and health education, entertainment, public\naffairs, offerings on national TV, and regional and community information to\nrural homes could be useful. In the early: 1930\'.s when electric power was becoming\na necessity for rural homes amd farms, the Rural Electrification Administration\nwas created to provide them with electric power. \'Today, telecommunications have\nbecome another such common need, and the Panel believes that the full range of\ninformational, educational and entertainment programs could be ` delivered electron\nically to our 50 million rural residents.\nExtensive cable systems could provide adequate transmission capacity but only\nat a vexy.high cost to individual users.in rural areas, because a high per capita\ninvestment would be required to serve areas of low population density.`\' A goostationary communications satellite can provide service to many areas of low\npopulation density at `a fraction of the cost of cable systems. To assure that the\n20\n\nprograms could be received in the maximum number of communities across the country,\nground receiving stations have to be of low cost. The Panel believes that this\ncould be achieved. Because the proposed service could attract millions of users,\nthe Panel believes that a home receiver installation developed and designed for\nthis service shou?d be available at a cost under $500.\nThe proposed rural satellite TV service, in addition to broadcast TV service,\ncould enable rural areas and communities to share in the cultural and entertainment now available in metropolitan centers. Live performances of drama, opera,\nconcerts, and ballet; and museum visits, lectures, meetings, sports events,\nconventions, and other events could be beamed to the rural TV geostationary\nsatellite, which in turn would rebroadcast these existing programs over the\nentire country. The program could be shown on large-screen, high-resolution\nTV projectors in existing auditoriums or theaters or, via short cable distribution systems, in homes. The Panel believes that with modest admission charges\nat TV theaters and modest charges per program to cable distribution system users,\nseveral hundred ground installations could make an operational system profitable.\nMoreover, the program sources, such as opera, ballet, concerts, etc., which\nnote barely exist on contributions, may become economically solvent.\n\nThe PaneZ recommends further study of rural TV services\nestabZish systL..n concepts, costs, and benefits.\n\nto\n\nMONITORING OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES\nThe use of satellites for transmission of environmental and resources data\ncould involve both the transmission of data collected by satellite-borne remote\nsensors and the relay of data transmitted from remote earth-based sensors via a\ncommunications satellite to one or more ground stations.\nIf high-resolution images of a relatively large portion of the surface of\nthe earth are needed, data transmission rates as high as 250 million bit per\nsecond may be required.\nCollection and relay of data by satellites from ground-based in situ sensor\nplatforms could encompass a variety of functional needs. For instance, data on\nslowly varying environmental parameters, such as river flow, need to be sampled\nno more often than several times daily. For this application, the data rate is\nlow and the platform locations are fixed and known but there may be a need to\ncollect data from tens of thousands of such platforms, some located in areas\nthat would be difficult for frequent human access. Dc-rivation of wind velocity\nfrom position data collected by free-floating balloons depends on frequent interrogations and computations. Similarly, ocean currents are computed from frequent\nsuccessive measurements of the positions of free-floating buoys. Balloon and\nbuoy platforms also can provide in situ environmental data.\nAs has been-indicated earlier, data collected by crews prospecting for\nminerals or petroleum must be relayed to a central data analysis facility with\nsufficient speed so that geophysical data can be analyzed and interpreted and\nappropriate instructions can be transmitted to the crews promptly.\nPresent communications system-, operating and piann:4 . , which ate-designed\nto relay satellite-borne remote-sensor data can accommodate the anticipated rate\nof 250 million bits per second only with difficulty. Higher car-ier frequencies\n21\n\nwould ease this problem. Research and development presently being undertaken on\nhigher frequency systems, including m^llimeter wave length and laser systems, for\nfuture wide-band applica t ions should be continued.\nThe Panel recommends that NASA continue its research and development program on higher frequency systems, including millimeter\nwave length and laser systems, for applications which need wider\n\nbands.\nWILDLIFE MONITORING\nTo understand how to protect endangered species and to help assure adequate\nnumbers of animals that are important members of the natural food chain, biO107\ngists need information on wildlife migration patterns, populations, herd size,\nphysiological changes and habits. In the envisioned use of satellites to help\nprovide this needed i nformation about wildlife, electronic packages would be\nattached to selected animals and data relayed via a satellite to a ground center.\nElectronic packages carried by animals could transmit animal location information derived from OMEGA or a similar navigation system. T}e package also could\ninclude physiological sensors for selected animals to measure parameters of interest to biologists such as respiration rate and EKG. The package should be small,\nlightweight, and low in power consumption. The satellite system could be similar\nto that now used for data collection by low-orbiting satellites. Initial experimentation could involve relatively large animals, while research and development\n(needed to permit very small and .Eight transmitters) is done. Some limited\nexperiments have already been made, and it appears that the ability of satellites\nto track and to collect data from many small transmitters can make it practical\nto monitor wildlife physical condition, populations and migratory patterns.\nThe Panel recommends that a limited number of experiments in\nwildlife monitoring be undertaken by NASA using existing data\ncollection systems, such as that on ERTS--1, to give the biological community experience in the use of space technology and\nto provide guidance for the research and development required\nfor future programs.\nMe Panel also recommends that studies be undertaken by the biological community, with assistance as appropriate from NASA and\nthe Department of the Interior, to ascertain what animals should\nbe monitored and with what priority, to ascertain systems require-\n\nments, and to determine costs and benefits.\nAt frequencies currently used for data collection up-links, interference\ncan be a problem for future law-powered transmitters suitable for carriage by\nanimals.\nThe Panel recommends that NASA undertake the studies necessary\nto support adequate international frequency allocations for wildlife monitoring. Such studies should include.measurements of the.\n\nelectromagnetic environment from earth orbit for present and\npoten.;iaZ data collection bands.\n22\n\nAMATEUR RADIO SERVICE\n\nMany amateur radio operators are highly skilled and innovative professional\nand technical people who use their hobby to test ideas and techniques. A number\nof them have been led to careers in electronics as a result of interest developed\nthrough amateur radio. Amateur radio operations contribute to international\nunderstanding and good will and often provide public services in emergencies.\nAt their own expense, amateurs have built several small satellites that have\nbeen carried piggy-back into low earth orbit, giving the amateur radio community\nthe capability for transoceanic VHF voice and code communications for short\nperiods several times each day. Amateur radio satellites at geosynchronous altitude would give amateurs the capability of transoceanic communications at any\ntame, and some amateurs would like to build such satellites. There are no technical impediments to the implementation of geostationary satellite amateur radio\nservice, and it is within the capability of the amateurs to build the required\nsatellite transponder. In the past, the Department of Defense and NASA have provided launches for amateur satellites when spare payload space was available. on\nlaunch vehicles placing payloads in low-earth orbit. The Panel hopes that if\namateurs undertake to build a geostationary satellite, DOD and NASA will be able\nto find space for it on one of their missions placing other payloads at geosvnchronous altitude.\n\nSOME COMMENTS ON\nBUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT COMMUNICATIONS\n\nThe Panel considered business and government communications as a potential\nservice and on balance it was decided not to treat it as a separate service ir.\nthis report. The main consideration was the early availability of commercial\ndomestic satellite services with ample capacity for video, voice and data communication. A vital aspect of interlinking business and government operations\nover long distances is the terminal equipment and the techniques of teleconferencing. Government-funded studies are under way to develop the optimal methods\nfor such contacts, involving video, voice, facsimile, etc., and various combinations thereof to establish how to maximize effectiveness and achieve favorable\npsychological reactions to the use of these media.\nCompeting with the domestic satellite systems will be existing terrestrial\nlinks. To encourage substitution of telecommunications for travel (and thus\nsave energy), communisations satellites with much higher: power, permitting the\nuse of low-cost ground equipment, will be required.\nIn considering the substitution of telecommunications for travel, one must\ndifferentiate between individual business trips and mass travel. By mass travel,\nthe Panel refers to the daily commuting of people by automobiles to and from\nwork in our large metropolitan centers. This matter has been studied by HUD\'s\nNew Rural Society project, resulting in some significant data: about 25 percent\nof the nation\'s gasoline is consumed by daily commuting involving one-way distances greater than 20 miles. This consumption could be radically reduced by\nproviding people with an opportunity to live and work in attractive rural communities. (To reach this goal and to apply communications technology in this.\ndirection is the object of the New Rural Society project.)\nBusiness travel of industry and government personnel consumes much smaller\nproportion of the nation\'s energy supply. Nevertheless, telecommunications\ntechniques (including the use of satellite communications) are worth pursuing.\nReducing business travel will not only save a certain amount of energy but will\nsubstantially decrease the fatigue of and time expended by the individuals\ninvolved. The success of such substitution depends on the effectiveness of the\nperson-to-person or people communications links, compared with face-to-face\nmeetings. The New Rural Society project has for the past two years engaged in\nstudies and experiments in this field. Actual daily application of teleconferencing by business.resulted from some of these studies. A nationwide largescale use through space com,. -iications systems,. utilizing low-cost ground terminals would considerably accelerate the decentralization of governmeit,\nbusiness and people. Satellite Systems A and B, described in Appendix B, are\n25\n.PIMBDINc pAGR\nNOT FM\n\ns\nf\n\nexamples of how to obtain such broad=based services. Whether private industry\nor government should create this facility the Panel is not able to judge.\n\nMULTIPLE \xe2\x80\x94 SERVICE SATELLITES\n\nThe services. discussed earlier in this report would not each require a\nspecial or dedicated satellite. instead, a few multipurpose public service\ncommunications satellites could provide the services considered significant by\nthe Panel (and other services as well). Formidable institutional problems will\nhave to be surmounted,. however, because some of the services would appropriately\nbe provided by the private sector at a cost to the user, and other services\nneeded by the public but not economically viable (time and frequency signals, for\nexample) would be available only if provided by the government.\nIn the course of its work, the Panel did a brief system analysis, with the\nobjective of providing at least a preliminary indication of how many satellites\nmight be required, and what their characteristics might be.\nBeginning with the needs expressed to the Panel by the several user panels\nat the study, and taking into consideration the potential services described\nearlier in this report, the Panel prepared two illustrative matrices. One\ndelineates the characteristics which each potential service would require of a\nsatellite. The second matrix groups the services which have common technical\nneeds, and shows the characteristics of four conceptual satellite communication\nsystems which together could provide the services discussed in this report. The\nmatrices with some additional discussion, are presented in Appendix A.\nTwo of the four conceptual systems would not require separate satellites.\nInstead, the space portion of these two systems could be incorporated into satellites al.rp ady planned, such as ERTS, NIMBUS, and GOES. (See discussion of Systems\nC and D in Appendix A.)\nThe other two conceptual designs would involve satellites able to broadcast\ndirectly to community antennas or to receivers equipped with fairly small antennas.\nOne (System A), operating at 2.5 GHz, is intended to provide education, health\ncare, disaster warning, time and frequency signals, and mobile communications Services (this satellite could accommodate amateur radio interests as well). The Panel\nllite within about five\nsees the technical possibility of launching such a sate\nyears if the needs can be aggregrated and verified.\nThe second satellite (System B), operating at 12 GHz, would provide electronic\nmail and rural TV and teleculture . services, as well as improved services for mobile\ncommunications, disaster warming, time and frequency signals and amateur radio..\nThe Panel envisions that System B could be launched several years after System A\n(that is, in five to ten years) if needed.\nThe delivery of education services may require a hybrid system that will\nutilize the satellites indicated for Systems A and B. Such a system would utilize\n27\n\nnew or already existing redistribution systems and thus permit maintaining essential characteristics of existing education institutions.\nRudimentary designs for the conceptual Systems A and B are presented in\n\nAppendix B.\nA concept for using two direct broadcast satellites of the type described as\nSystem B to provide television and teleculture to rural areas nationwide is\n\ndescribed in Appendix C.\n\nf\n\nIMPACT OF SPACE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\nON SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS\n\nIf the Space Shuttle System provides low-cost transportation to and from \t\nearth orbit, substantial economic benefits could be expected from space communications systems carried to orbit by the shuttle. Of particular interest is the...\ner\nprojected availability, in the early years of the next decade, of an Interim Upp\nStage (the Space Tug) which not only offers the possibility of placing heavy payloads (up to 3,000 kg) into geostationary orbit but also of providing services,\nsuch as payload retrieval, that are not possible with present launch vehicles.\nBoth the design and the operation of future communications and position determination satellites would be affected by the new capabilities. Satellites in which\nthe initial stages have modest requirements in power, mass, and size will become\ncandidates for launch by the space shuttle as their coverage expands and as.space\ntraffic increases. There is a discernible trend toward more individual access by\nusers to satellite-ground circuits, particularly where data transmission systems\nneed to serve directly individual users instead of relaying information through\ncentralized collection points. The space segment will need to grow in mass and\nvolume if the cost of the ground segment is to be kept within reasonable limits.\nSeveral possible areas of application have a number of common needs and thus\nmay be served by integrated spacecraft systems. Areas of major impact on configuration design include spacecraft reliability (as in systems redundancy) and\noperational replenishment (as in multiple satellite launches, orbital standby,\n\nj\n\nand payload retrieval) .\n\nThe PaneZ recommends that future studies of communication satellite concepts consider use of the space shuttle as a baseline\n\npayload carrier.\nTypical communications experiments which might be accommodated on Spacelab.\n\nk..\n\nare:\nTests of deployability, contour accuracy, and pointing capability\nof large antennas for spot-beam communications with small ground\nterminals. Such antennas offer to conserve spectrum by allowing\nreuse of the same frequency in different geographical areas.\n\ni\n\n29\n^^\t\n\n1\n\n^I\n\nTests of space laser systems for satellite-to-satellite interconnections, of . shuttle-ground communications by relay satellites and\nof global coverage for other services.\nStudy of propagation and atmospheric signal distortion phenomena.\nTests of electronic components for communication systems.\nIn the near future, these experiments will involve tests in the space environment\nof devices that are feasible and now under development.(such as sun-pumped .laser.\nand open-envelope tube amplifiers). Moreover, processing of materials in space\nmay make possible new or improved semiconductor materials, which in turn may make\nfeasible such components as advanced microwave devices, laser elements, coldemission cathodes, and solar -energy converters, all of which could be of great\nimportance in space communications systems.\nThe Panel feels that efforts should be intensified to perform, on a broad\nscale, payload analyses and experiment-accommodation studies for the Space\n\nLaboratory.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nMULTIPLE-SERVICE SATELLITES\nFrom initial discussions by. the Panel on Uses of Communications, it appeared\nthat a fairly large number of space communication services could be identified\nwhich either are imminent because of their feasibility and benefits or are predictable from observation of historical trends and from an examination of users\'\nneeds. About 20 different services resulted from a first survey, but were later\nreduced to the most significant ones.\nStarting with this set of baseline services, the Panel considered factors\nwhich would influence what services could be combined and served by a single satellite system, such as system configurations, modes of communication, launch vehicle\nrequirements, technical characteristics, and operational/institutional aspects.\nTo arrive at a systematic presentation and to facilitate interpretation and\ndevelopment of conclusions, the Panel prepared two illustrative matrices (Tables I\nand II, below). Not being based on detailed system studies, the matrices cannot\nindicate precise parameters, nor can they present soiutions to technical or\norganizational problems. However, they are intended to assist in assessing common\ntopological features, identifying key technology problems, postulating traffic\nvolumes, showing the impact on the space transportation. program, and identifying\nmajor problem areas.\nTable I classifies 11 selected services according to their network topology\nand to the type of information carried. It was considered useful to arrange the\nservices in the Panel\'s view of a descending order of priority.\nNetwork topology is divided into three main classes: point(s)- to-paints)\ncommunications, broadcasting services, and data collection services. Point(s)to-point(s)-communications systems are characterized by a large number of small\nidentical\nor medium--sized terminals for .two-way operation., but not restricted\nchannel capacities in both directions. For example, in the educational service, \t\nuse\nwhere the teaching program is sent over video channels, the return\nonly narrow-band links. In most cases, these systems. do not show a homogeneous\nstations and\nfew IaTge- mon for\nconfiguration, but are a mix of many small\ning or program-generating terminals. The figures given indicate typical numbers\nof terminals and antenna dimensions.\nThe use of satellite broadcast systems, as considered here, is. not limited\nto the dissemination of public TV programs. Distribution of any forth of informa-\t\ntion either to highly concentrated populations or to users in widely dispersed\nareas is included. The Panel categorized\nservices into three major classes:\n\nto\nchannel may\n\nuser\n\nsuch\n\n31\n\n1\n\na:\n\na\n\nService\nMobile a.:;\nElectronic Ma:i1\n\nSmall\n\nMedium\n\n10.\n\nIndividual\n\nCommunity\t\n\nFixed\n\n< 10\n\n3 m\n10 5\n\ns0\n\n6.m\n\nx\n\nx\n\nHealth Care\n\nx\n\nx\n\nData\nx\n\n3 m\n\n125\n\nEducation:or PBS\n\n500\n\nVoice\nx\n\nVideo\t\n\nMobile\n\nx\n\n105\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\n(facsimile)\nx\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n2 m/ 6 dB b\n\nRural TV, Teleculture,\n\n105\n\nor PBS\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\n3 m/ 2.5 dB\n\nx\n\nx\n\n103\n\n-\n\nI^7\n\nSearch and Rescue\n\n104\n\nx\n\n<100\n\nEnvironmental: and\nResource Data\n\nx\n\nDisaster Warning\n\n106\n\nTime and Frequency\nStandard Distribution\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\t\n\nx\n(optical)\n\nx\n\n106\n\nWildlife, Monitoring\nAmateur Radio\n\n103\n\n104\n104\n\nx\n\nx\nx\n\na Includes land mobile communications, maritime communications and maritime position determination.\nb Antc!,na size / receiver noise figure.\nTABLE I NETWORK TOPPLOGY AND TYPE OF INFORMATION CARRIED\n\nx\n\nx\n\nbroadcasting to individuals (direct home reception), broadcasting to communities,\nand broadcasting to redistribution systems. All three broadcasting systems,\nbroadcasting to homes, communities, and redistributiov centers could become a part\nof the education delivery system.\nNo recommendation is given for broadcast services to redistribution centers\nsince it is expected that this service will be provided by the coming generation\nof domestic communication satellite systems. Grund receiver noise factors are\ngiven in decibels (d$).\nData collection systems comprise a large number of widely distributed fixed\nor mobile ground-based platforms that are interrogated by communication satellites.\nThe dominating requirement comes from environmental and resources services.\nA column.shows the requirement for position determination of ships and aircraft, of migrating animals, and of points from which warning or distress signals\noriginate.\nFinally, the matrix identifies the type of information associated with a\nparticular service.\nTable II, Concepts of Experimental Satellite Communication Systems, is the\nresult of grouping the same 11 services into four different combinations of\npotentially integrated spacecraft payloads. This approach, while not supported\ncompatibility studies, is intended to give suggested direction for\nby in\nfuture efforts.\nThe objectives are to obtain high economy in orbital space usage and launch\ncosts by integration of similar mission requirements or common technical characteristics into conceptual multipurpose communication satellites. As a minimum\nset of applicable commonality factors, the first six columns show: the preferred\nfrequency bands (e.g., L-Band, 2.5 GHz, 12 GHz, etc.); the time frame of first\nimplementation of service; the type of orbit (e.g., geostationary, low-inclination\npolar); the mass in orbit; the typical launch vehicle size (category); and an\nestimated launch rate (average over system life and including failures).\nThe Panel recognizes the lack of precision in the informati-an given; nonetheless, it believes that these launch requirements can be used for the development\nof application mi\xc2\xb0sion models in the 1975-1985 time frame.\nA separate column shows where Shuttle/Spacelab experimentation is considered\nnecessary in order to improve technologies of certain space systems or qualify\nnew technologies before committing them to automated spacecraft.\nThe other columns concern the development of technology for spacecraft\nantennas (large deployable reflectors, multiple beams); on-board power generation;\nimproved attitude control and position keeping; spacecraft transponder (high\nfrequency, high efficiency); ground terminal gain/noise factor-ratio (low-noise\nreceivers); up-link requirements (optimum modulation methods); and ground tracking\nrequirements (low-cost ship terminals).\nA last group of parameters marks the need for activities in the fields of\npropagation.(studie.s.of phenomena in different media), spectrum utilization\n(optimum frequency allocation), and institutional arrangements.\n\n33\n\n1\n\nGround RFD\t\n\nSpace RFD\t\n\nFrequency Antenna sower \t\n\nStationkeeping\t\nand Control\t\n\nSpace\n\nShuttle\nPropagation Frequency Institutional\nSystem\t\nUplink Multiple\t\nProblem\nAccess Tracking Experiment \'* and Media Allocation\t\nTransponder Antenna Power \t\n\nSusta^ ti"\nx\n\nx\n\nx\t\n\nMobile Communications\nEducation or PUS\n\nF\t\n\n\'\n\nb\n\n2.5 Gliz\n\nx\n\nx\n\nIlealth Care\n\nE\n\nL-band\n\n2.5 G11i\n\nx\n\nx\n\nDisaster Warning\n\n.\n\nTime and Frequency\nAmateur Radio\n\nL-band\nx\t\n\nvilF\n\nx\n\nx\n\nUIIF\n\nSpats^ - 5\nMobile Communications\n\nL-band\n\nElectronic Nail\n\nx\t\n\nx\t\n\nx\n\nL-band\n\nTime and Frequency\n\nx\n\n12 Gllx\t\n\nDisaster Warning\n\nx\n\nVEIF\n\nAmateur Radio\n\nz\n\nx\t\n\n12 Glix\n\nx\t\n\nx\nx\t\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nAural TV, Teleculture\n\nor 1 1 115\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\t\n\nx\t\n\nUIIF\n\nSJ 8 tfr?

Typically,\nthe total of 28 transponders can be utilized as follows. On Satellite I, three\n400 watt high-power signals are produced by combining 4 output stages for each\nof three national TV channels corresponding to the commercial networks. These\nthree TV signals, each 40 MHz wide, are fed to the same antenna, covering the\nentire U.S. Two more channels on the same satellite serve regions I and II,\napproximately corresponding to Time Zones I and II, counting from the West.\nSatellite Il has two national broadcast channels, again each combining the output from four 100 watt transmitters. One of these channels could be assigned\nto the Public Broadcast Service and the other to cable networking or for\neducational-health care services. Of the remaining six 100 watt transmitters,\ntwo serve Time Zone III and four broadcast to Time Zone TV (East. Coast of the\nU.S.). This makes it possible on the average for 6 states to share one transponder. Thus, within a given region or time zone, each state can have a onesixth share of a broadcast day to transmit pertinent local or regional information which can be received everywhere within the zone. Each satellite would\nhave two antennas, the smaller one taking the broadcast feeds covering the\nentire nation, and the large antenna serving the individual zones.\nFigure I illustrates the above and also the number of 40 MHz channels\ntransmitted by the two satellites. The twelfth 40 MHz channel, namely. F 6 , is\nreserved to be combined with F S providing an 80 MHz wide special broadcast\nchannel for the high-resolution color TV signals for theater projection discussed under "Teleculture."\nRegarding reception, it is estimated that a two-meter antenna, together with\na 250\xc2\xb0 receiver and using a parametric amplifier at room temperature, will provide commercially acceptable pictures anywhere in the U.S.\n\nSatellite I\nF7\t\n\nti\nI National I\tI ^lativnal\nChannel 3\t\n\nChannel 2\t\n\nF8\n\nZone i\t\n\nF 2\tF3\t\n\nZone I I\n\nAntenna for\nZones I and I I\n\nNational\t\nAntenna\t\n\nSatellite 2\nF4\n\nF5 F6\n\nF 7\tFg\n\nF8\t\n\nFlo\t\n\nFill\t\n\nFit\n\nZone I I I I I Zone [ I I I I Zone IV I I Zone IV I I Zone IV I I Zone IV\n\nr\t\n\n^\n\nNational\n\nAntenna for\n\nAntenna\n\nZones III and IV\n\nt\n\nOTHER SERVICES IN SYSTEMS A AND B\n\n:\t\n\nSystem A in Table II (p. 34) uses a geostationary satellite that should be\nlaunched within five years to provide services for mobile communications,\neducation, health care, disaster warning, time and frequency dissemination, and\namateur radio.\nThe satellite would have an b-Band transponder to provide the mobile communications service. It would have a 2.5 GHz transmitter (6 GHz receiver) to\nprovide professional education and audio-visual technical material distribution\nfor the education, medical and other professional communities. Disaster warning\nexperiments would be undertaken using the 2.5 GHz transmitter (6 GHz receiver).\nExperiments in time and frequency dissemination could be performed using a UHF\ntransmitter for home reception and a higher frequency transmitter for the high\naccuracy commercial service. Signals for both services would emanate from an\natomic clock. A separate UHF transponder would be included to serve the amateur radio operators.\nThe mobile communications service would operate with the shipboard and aircraft systems now being built for experimentation with ATS-6 and MARISAT.\nThe system would provide education and health care services to as many as\n100,000 ground stations having one-meter diameter antennas and receivers with\na 3.5 dB noise figure at 2.5 GHz, There would be one video channel for each\ntime zone.\nStudies will be needed to develop the systems specifications for all\nthese services and for the appropriate experiments for the disaster warning,\ntime and frequency, and amateur radio services.\nAttention will also be needed to the design of the software and organizational.arrangements for the delivery of these services, so they can be implemented on a total system basis.\t\nSystem B in Table II uses a geostationary satellite that should be launched\nin five to 10 years to provide services for mobile communications, electronic\nmail, rural areas, disaster warning, time and frequency dissemination and\namateur radio.\nThe satellite would have an L-Band transponder to provide the mobile communications service. it would have a 12 to 14 GHz transponder for pre-operational\ntesting of an electronic mail service and for the distribution of video programs\nto rural areas. An operational disaster warning service could be implemented\nusing the 12 to 14 GHz transponder or the equipment developed for System A. An \t\noperational time and frequency dissemination service would be provided by equipment similar to that developed for System A but with improved accuracy. The\namateur service could be served with a UHF transponder similar to that used \t\non System A, with a higher--frequency transponder, or both.\nThe mobile communications service would operate with as many as 10,000 \t\nterminals that are compatible with the mobile terminals used for. System A.\nThe electronic mail service would operate with six-meter diameter antennas\nat the 125 major postal distribution centers and with as many as 100,000 three\nmeter diameter antennas at local post office and commercial business offices.\nThis service would use the space and ground technology presently being developed\nfor the CTS satellite.\t\n\n45\n\nj\n\na\na\nj\n\ni\ni\nI\n1\ni\n\ni\n\nThe rural area high-resolution color television service would furnish\nsignals to approximately 1,0:00 community receivers with three-meter diameter\nantennas and 250\xc2\xb0 K noise temperature receivers. These terminals would provide\na particularly high quality 735 line color TV service for the broadcast of cultural and sporting events programming which could be shown on large screens, in\nauditoriums.\nDetails of the disaster warning and time and frequency services will require\nfurther study based on the experience obtained from System A.\nConsideration should be given to the use of the Space Transportation System\nto place the satellite in geostationary orbit.\nSystem C uses a satellite in low polar orbit that should be launched within\nfive years to provide data collection and position determination capabilities\nfor the mobile, wildlife monitoring, environment and resource data, and search\nand rescue services. This system could be implemented on a presently planned\nsatellite such as ERTS-C.\nThe position determination capability would be based on the use of the\nOMEGA navigation system to provide an accuracy of + 2 km for relatively coarse\nrequirements and an order of magnitude better accuracy where a differential\nOMEGA implementation is possible.\nThe data collection capability would be based on the random access technique\nnow being implemented on NIMBUS-F.\nThe search and rescue service would use an adaptation of the Global Rescue\nand Alarm Net system.\nStudies are required to determine the appropriate methods of providing more\naccurate position determination information (including the use of NAVSTAR) and\nto determine the number of data collection platforms to be served.\nSystem D uses a geostationary satellite to be launched in five to 10 years\nto provide data collection and position determination capabilities for the\nmobile, wildlife monitoring, environment and resource data, and search and\nrescue services. This system could be implemented on a presently planned satellite such as GOES.\nThe geostationary capability is particularly important for applications,\nsuch as search and rescue and high data rate continuous data relay, that require\ngood temporal coverage.\nMore detailed studies of the requirements of the various services are needed\nfor a more complete description of System D.\n\n'
