VBL's are micromagnetic structures within magnetic domain walls which can be manipulated using magnetic fields from integrated conductors. The presence or absence of VBL pairs are used to store binary information. At present, efforts are being directed at developing a single-chip memory using 25Mbit/sq cm technology in magnetic garnet material which integrates, at a single operating point, the writing, storage, reading, and amplification functions needed in a memory. This paper describes the current design architecture, functional elements, and supercomputer simulation results which are used to assist the design process. The current design architecture uses three metal layers, two ion implantation steps for modulating the thickness of the magnetic layer, one ion implantation step for assisting propagation in the major line track, one NiFe soft magnetic layer, one CoPt hard magnetic layer, and one reflective Cr layer for facilitating magneto-optic observation of magnetic structure. Data are stored in a series of elongated magnetic domains, called stripes, which serve as storage sites for arrays of VBL pairs. The ends of these stripes are placed near conductors which serve as VBL read/write gates. A major line track is present to provide a source and propagation path for magnetic bubbles. Writing and reading, respectively, are achieved by converting magnetic bubbles to VBL's and vice versa. The output function is effected by stretching a magnetic bubble and detecting it magnetoresistively. Experimental results from the past design cycle created four design goals for the current design cycle. First, the bias field ranges for the stripes and the major line needed to be matched. Second, the magnetic field barrier between the stripe and the read/write gates needed to be reduced. Third, current conductor routing needed to be improved to reduce occurrences of open-circuiting, short-circuiting, and eddy-current shielding. Fourth, a modified Co-alloy was needed with an increased coercivity and controlled magnetization to allow VBL stabilization to occur without affecting stripe stability.", "title": "Vertical bloch line memory", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T15:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940004374, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Katti, R."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "46900cdcb19b4c6e9bae078f7b10ad64"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940004374, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wu, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "5d41877a549a4810a897a8bc54966906"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19940004374, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stadler, H."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "5d917a810177433d827ce42cec791628"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940004374, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940004374, "id": "4a2d76ca7d764ad3b509f6069db88df2", "publicationName": "Idaho Univ., The 2nd 1990 NASA SERC Symposium on VLSI Design", "publicationDate": "1990-11-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940004343, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Space Engineering Research Center Symposium on VLSI Design", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940004374.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940004374/downloads/19940004374.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940004374/downloads/19940004374.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940004374/downloads/19940004374.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
