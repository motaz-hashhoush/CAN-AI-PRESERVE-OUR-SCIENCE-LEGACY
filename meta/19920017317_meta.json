The testing was part of a lubrication program. The objectives are to develop and show a separate lubricant for gearboxes with improved performance in life and load carrying capacity. The goal was to develop a testing procedure to fail certain transmission components using a MIL-L-23699 based reference oil and then to run identical tests with improved lubricants and show improved performance. The tests were directed at parts that failed due to marginal lubrication from Navy field experience. These failures included mast shaft bearing micropitting, sun gear and planet bearing fatigue, and spiral bevel gear scoring. A variety of tests were performed and over 900 hrs of total run time accumulated for these tests. Some success was achieved in developing a testing procedure to produce sun gear and planet bearing fatigue failures. Only marginal success was achieved in producing mast shaft bearing micropitting and spiral bevel gear scoring.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19920017317, "endDate": "1992-09-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "ASME"}}, "meetingId": "879ad15b78a546758b53448de6b2dbea", "id": "60705016d6744b92b633126c1fa229d4"}], "name": "International Power Transmission and Gearing Conference", "location": "Phoenix, AZ", "id": "879ad15b78a546758b53448de6b2dbea", "startDate": "1992-09-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920017317, "id": "6ae182745da44518b8f75db1fcc69d81", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920017317.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920017317/downloads/19920017317.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920017317/downloads/19920017317.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920017317/downloads/19920017317.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
