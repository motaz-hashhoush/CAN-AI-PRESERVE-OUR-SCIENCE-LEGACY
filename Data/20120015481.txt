Monitoring technologies are employed to assure that the chemical and microbial content of the air and water environment of the\nastronaut crew habitat falls within acceptable limits, and that the life support system is functioning properly and efficiently. The sensors may also provide data to automated\ncontrol systems. All proposed technologies should have a 3 year shelf-life, including any calibration materials (liquid or gas). The technologies will need to function in\nmicrogravity and low pressure environments (-& psi), and may see unpressurized storage. Significant improvements are sought in miniaturization and operational reliability, as\nwell as long life, in-line operation, self-calibration, reduction of expendables, low energy consumption, and minimal operator time/maintenance for monitoring and controlling\nlife-support processes.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Process control sensors for closed loop life support systems: Targeted sensors include humidity in gases such as Ol, H), and C0); volatile organic compounds in 0)\nand COl010CS in CO) would be in the C0) removal/concentration product that would feed to any CO) reduction process); composition of CO) reduction effluent Ka.~it::; I.\n(C0), CO, CH4, and H)O) from either a Sabatier- or Bosch-based CO) reduction process; and combustible gas sensors for Hl in an 0) background and 02 in an H2\nbackground from electrolysis.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Trace toxic metals in wate.r.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Microbial monitoring of water and surfaces using minimal consumables.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Optimal system control methods. Operate the life support system with optimal efficiency and reliability, using a carefully chosen suite offeedback and health monitors,\nand the associated control system.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sensor suites. Develop an approach for selecting number, types and placement of sensors in a distributed network for optimal environmental monitoring. Develop an\napproach to effi. iently analyze data from a suite of sensors within a distributed network for optimal environmental monitoring.\nc\n\nSpacecraft Fire Protection Technology Needs\nThe overheating or combustion of spacecraft materials can introduce many types of particulate and gaseous contaminants into the cabin atmosphere. Technologies that not\nonly detect smoke particulate but identify important characteristics such as particulate size and composition would be extremely useful for rapid identification of the fire source.\nThese must be of suitable size, mass, and volume for a distributed sensor array in spacecraft systems. Also, catalytic or sotbent technologies suitable for the rapid removal of\ngases, especially CO, and particulate during a contingency response are desired.\n\n03.07 Cryogenic Fluid MaJ\\age1nent Technologies\nLead Center: KSC\nThe ultimate objective of this Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFlVl) Technologies solicitation is to demonstrate a variety of critical CFM technologies in a micro-gravity space\nenvironment via a deployable or non-deployable test beel\ninitial phase (phase I) will identify and develop prototype experiments that could be integrated into a universal platfonn for demonstration of these experiments in their\nrelevant micro-gravity environment\nThe second phase (phase II) of this solicitation would develop a unive.rsal and innovative test bed platfo.n n that could be launched as a secondary payload on an expendable\nlaunch vehicle.\nState of the art: CFM technologies are, for the most part, limited to ground tests that do not provide a complete and accurate demonstration of the technologies in their true\noperational environment. This increases risk in the development of emerging technologies for future applications in the areas of space based propellant depots, low gravity\ndescent and ascent operations, and future space or planetary based architectures.\nAreas of interest:\nThe purpose of these experiments would be to allow testing of:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Designs for fluid and propellant transfer plumbing\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multi-layer insulation (MLI) designs\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Various mass gauging designs\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Thermal control and boil-off control designs in a true micro-gravity space env1rQt}Il\\ent\n\n'
