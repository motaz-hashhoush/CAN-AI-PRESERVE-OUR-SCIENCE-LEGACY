The Agency must also invest in understanding the broader propulsion system-level technology gaps in parallel. Timeframes are considered suggested from a priority standpoint, but are also flexible as some efforts will need to occur in the nearer term or concurrently in order to meet specific mission requirements The GPWG developed 2018 roadmap breaks down the technology development goals into Technology Development Areas (TDA's), and identifies the near-, mid, and long-term sub-goals within those areas. Those TDA's are: Thruster Hardware Development Modeling & Tools Development Materials Properties and Compatibility Propellant Development.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20180005461, "endDate": "2018-05-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Department of the Navy", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "5e0149716af64bbdab80f3f4edbdaac3", "id": "79749e8d90cb47fcbf465da29b8d1fc5"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "5e0149716af64bbdab80f3f4edbdaac3", "id": "dfc69672eaa6452085272be7535d932f"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Department of the Army", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "5e0149716af64bbdab80f3f4edbdaac3", "id": "d320d25f786c41b4acd24362292cf47f"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Department of the Air Force", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "5e0149716af64bbdab80f3f4edbdaac3", "id": "41262cc0a1f04ff8a10994d450936b89"}], "name": "JANNAF Propulsion Meeting", "location": "Long Beach, CA", "id": "5e0149716af64bbdab80f3f4edbdaac3", "startDate": "2018-05-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180005461, "id": "d52890cbf7f241fd9ad4bc27d59dbd9b", "publicationDate": "2018-05-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180005461.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180005461/downloads/20180005461.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180005461/downloads/20180005461.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180005461/downloads/20180005461.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
