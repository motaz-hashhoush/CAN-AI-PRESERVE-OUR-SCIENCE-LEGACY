In 2001, the first on-orbit hyperspectral imager, Hyperion, was launched aboard the Earth Observing-1 spacecraft. Based on the hyperspectral imaging sensors used in Earth observation satellites, Stennis Space Center engineers and Institute for Technology Development researchers collaborated on a new design that was smaller and used an improved scanner. Featured in Spinoff 2007, the technology is now exclusively licensed by Themis Vision Systems LLC, of Richmond, Virginia, and is widely used in medical and life sciences, defense and security, forensics, and microscopy.", "title": "Hyperspectral Systems Increase Imaging Capabilities", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-25T09:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20110000755, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110000755, "id": "452b595b7eff40fb80a66ff0baf70d3d", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110000755.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110000755/downloads/20110000755.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110000755/downloads/20110000755.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110000755/downloads/20110000755.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
