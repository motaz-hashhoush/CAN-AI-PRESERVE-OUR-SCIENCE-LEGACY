The educational process, which starts out with a large number of students at the elementary level, but with an ever smaller number preparing for science and engineering at each more advanced educational level, is in a state of crisis. These pipeline issues, so called because the educational process is likened to a series of ever smaller constrictions in a pipe, were examined in a workshop at the Space Grant Conference and a summary of the presentations and the results of the discussion, and the conclusions of the workshop participants are reported.", "title": "Pipeline issues", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930013959, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Eisley, Joe T."}, "organization": {"name": "Michigan Univ.", "location": "Ann Arbor, MI, United States"}}, "id": "6e4adc1f10d043efbcab60822d765d55"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930013959, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930013959, "id": "d849f31d67c34094954b24bb068e2929", "publicationName": "JHU, First National Space Grant Conference Report", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930013959.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930013959/downloads/19930013959.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930013959/downloads/19930013959.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930013959/downloads/19930013959.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
