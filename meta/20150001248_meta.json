The, at this point largely unexamined, plethora of possibilities going forward, a subset of which is discussed, could literally reinvent aerospace but requires triage of many possibilities. Such initial upfront homework would lengthen the Research and Development (R&D) time frame but could greatly enhance the affordability and performance of the evolved products and capabilities. Structural nanotubes and exotic energetics along with some unique systems approaches are particularly compelling.\n\n\n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150001248, "id": "2de672d8fcc44e6583c26938ee9d651d", "publicationDate": "2014-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150001248.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150001248/downloads/20150001248.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150001248/downloads/20150001248.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150001248/downloads/20150001248.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
