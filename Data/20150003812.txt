b'Imagery Integration Team\nTracy Calhoun, Dave Melendrez\nThe Human Exploration Science Office (KX) provides leadership for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Imagery Integration\n(I2) Team, an affiliation of experts in the use of engineering-class imagery intended to monitor the\nperformance of launch vehicles and crewed spacecraft in flight. Typical engineering imagery\nassessments include studying and characterizing the liftoff and ascent debris environments; launch\nvehicle and propulsion element performance; in-flight activities; and entry, landing, and recovery\noperations. I2 support has been provided not only for U.S. Government spaceflight (e.g., Space\nShuttle, Ares I-X) but also for commercial launch providers, such as Space Exploration\nTechnologies Corporation (SpaceX) and Orbital Sciences Corporation, servicing the International\nSpace Station.\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x93 Examples of launch imagery for (clockwise from top left)\nthe Space Shuttle, SpaceX Falcon 9, and Orbital Antares.\nThe NASA I2 Team is composed of imagery integration specialists from JSC, the Marshall Space\nFlight Center (MSFC), and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), who have access to a vast pool of\nexperience and capabilities related to program integration, deployment and management of imagery\nassets, imagery data management, and photogrammetric analysis. The I2 team is currently providing\n53\n\nintegration services to commercial demonstration flights, Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1), and the\nSpace Launch System (SLS)\xe2\x80\x93based Exploration Missions (EM)-1 and EM-2. EM-2 will be the first\nattempt to fly a piloted mission with the Orion spacecraft.\n\nFigure 2.\xe2\x80\x93 (Left to right) Notional views of the EFT-1 launch vehicle and SLS.\nThe I2 Team provides the customer (both commercial and Government) with access to a wide array\nof imagery options \xe2\x80\x93 ground-based, airborne, seaborne, or vehicle-based \xe2\x80\x93 that are available through\nthe Government and commercial vendors. The team guides the customer in assembling the\nappropriate complement of imagery acquisition assets at the customer\xe2\x80\x99s facilities, minimizing costs\nassociated with market research and the risk of purchasing inadequate assets. The NASA I2\ncapability simplifies the process of securing one-of-a-kind imagery assets and skill sets, such as\nground-based fixed and tracking cameras, crew-in the-loop imaging applications, and the integration\nof custom or commercial-off-the-shelf sensors onboard spacecraft.\n\nFigure 3.\xe2\x80\x93 (Left) Tracking cameras monitor ascent performance and separation events.\n(Right) The Ares 1-X test launch in October 2009.\n\n54\n\nFor spaceflight applications, the I2 Team leverages modeling, analytical, and scientific resources\nalong with decades of experience and lessons learned to assist the customer in optimizing\nengineering imagery acquisition and management schemes for any phase of flight \xe2\x80\x93 launch, ascent,\non-orbit, descent, and landing.\n\nFigure 4.\xe2\x80\x93 Modeling of separation event to evaluate the locations of photogrammetric targets.\nThe I2 Team guides the customer in using NASA\xe2\x80\x99s world-class imagery analysis teams, which\nspecialize in overcoming inherent challenges associated with spaceflight imagery sets. Precision\nmotion tracking, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) photogrammetry, image\nstabilization, 3D modeling of imagery data, lighting assessment, and vehicle fiducial marking\nassessments are available.\n\nFigure 5.\xe2\x80\x93 Modeling of spacecraft on-orbit inspections prior to entry.\n\n55\n\nDuring a mission or test, the I2 Team provides oversight of imagery operations to verify fulfillment\nof imagery requirements. The team oversees the collection, screening, and analysis of imagery to\nbuild a set of imagery findings. It integrates and corroborates the imagery findings with other\nmission data sets, generating executive summaries to support time-critical mission decisions.\n\nFigure 6.\xe2\x80\x93 Screening and analysis.\n\nAdvancements in Capsule Parachute Analysis\nDavid Bretz\nThe Image Science and Analysis Group (ISAG), a subgroup within the ARES Directorate, has\nprovided image analysis support of the Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) testing being\nconducted at the Yuma Proving Grounds by JSC Engineering. The work being done by ISAG is a\ncontinuation of photogrammetric analysis that began in 2010, which is expected to extend through\n2014 with the development and analysis of parachutes for the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV)\nbeing developed at JSC.\nAt the request of the engineers, ISAG developed methods for converting video imagery into\nparachute flight performance parameters, such as fly-out angles, parachute skirt diameters, and\ndrogue mortar deployment speeds. This information (along with many other parameters measured\nwith a variety of instruments) is used by engineers to understand and accurately model parachute\nbehavior, drag coefficient, and rate of descent. Good models will improve the fidelity of MPCV\nsimulations of roll control and splashdown impacts.\n\n56\n\n'
