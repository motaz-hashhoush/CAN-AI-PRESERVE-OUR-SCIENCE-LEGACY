In its first decade, it proved eminently successful in accomplishing both of\nits principal objectives: increasing small\nbusiness participation in high technology\nresearch and development activities, and\nstimulating conversion of government\nfunded R&D into commercial applications.\n\nNASA and 10 other technology generating government agencies each set aside a\npercentage of their R&D budgets for SBIR\nprojects, and each agency administers its\nown program independently under Small\nBusiness Administration guidelines.\nIn NASA\'s SBIR program, the\nagency has worked with more than 800 small\nbusinesses, who have developed hundreds of\nnew systems and components that advanced\nNASA\'s capability for aerospace research\nand operations. NASA evaluates proposals\nfrom small firms from the standpoint of\npotential usefulness to NASA and the potential for commercial spinoff. The best concepts are awarded six-month contracts under\nwhich the company determines the technical\nfeasibility of the innovation it has proposed.\nThe results of Phase I research may lead to\nfollow-on Phase I1 contracts that can run as\nlong as two years. In Phase 111, the small\nbusiness participant may apply the results\nof Phase 1/11 research to development of a\nproduct or process for the commercial market, using private capital to do so.\nShown at left is an example of a successful NASA SBIR program, the Dexterous\nHand MasterTM(DHM). The DHM is produced by EXOS, Inc., Lexington,\nMassachusetts, a company formed to manufacture and market products using robotic\nsensing technologies originally developed\nunder NASA contract by Arthur D. Little\'s\nCenter for Product Development,\nCambridge, Massachusetts.\nA 1989 winner of an R&D 100\nAward, the DHM is an exoskeleton device\nfor measuring the joints of the human\nhand with extreme precision. It was developed for NASA\'s use in controlling robots.\nIn 1990, Exos introduced a commercial\nversion, DHM Series 11.\n\nThe DHM\nI1 is worn on the\nhand, connected to\na computer that\nrecords hand\nmotions and transmits that data as\ncontrol signals to\nrobots and other\ncomputers. It is\nused in such applications as enabling\nrobotic hands to\nemulate human\nhand actions\nthrough remote\noperation; controlling and manipulating computer generated images in\nvirtual reality environments; and controlling musical performances by shaping\nacoustical parameters in real time, on stage,\nin concert with musicians.\nThe spinoff DHM inspired two additional spinoffs. In 1990, EXOS introduced to\nthe commercial market the GripMasterTM,\nintended for use in tool design, design of\nother hand-held objects or design of factory\nworkstations. The\nA SPECIAL PROGRAM STIMULATES SMALL BUSINESS\nGripMaster combines the\nPARTICIPATION IN NASA RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT joint angle sensing technology of the DHM with pressure\nsensing technology to give measurement of\ngrip strength and wrist position. The primary benefit is reduction of CTD (cumulative\ntrauma disorders) caused by repetitive\nmotions in the work place, a major occupational health risk.\nIn 1991, EXOS introduced a third\nproduct, the Clinical Hand Master SystemTM\n\n(left),a product designed for use by hand\nsurgeons, orthopaedic surgeons, physical\ntherapists and occupational therapists.\nAnother example is QASEB RT, a\nsystems engineering tool for quantitatively\nevaluating a computer system design hardware, software and data. Developed by\nAdvanced System Technologies, Inc. (AST),\nEnglewood, Colorado, the commercial QASE\nRT resulted from two different SBIR projects,\none sponsored by the U.S. Navy, the other\nby Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nThe purpose of QASE RT is to\nenable system analysts and software engineers to evaluate the performance and reliability implications of design alternatives.\nQASE RT evaluates system timing, capacity\nand availability. The user describes his system architecture and workload using direct\nmanipulation graphics. QASE RT translates\nthe system description into analytic and\ndiscrete event simulation models and\nexecutes them.\nAnalytics rapidly evaluate the\nfeasibility of a wide range of system configuration alternatives. Simulation provides\ndetailed performance evaluation. The\nresults of the evaluations are service and\nresponse times, offered load and device\nutilizations, and functional availability.\nAST, a computer performance\nengineering firm founded in 1984 as a\nresearch and development company, has\nbeen engaged in 16 SBIR contracts for\nvarious agencies. QASE RT, introduced in\n1991, was the company\'s first commercial\n(Continued)\nproduct line.\nTMDexterous\nHand Manipulator,Gri Master and Clinical Hand\nB\nMaster System are trademarks o f ~ ~ Inc. ~ ,\n@QASEis a registered trademark of Advanced System\nTechnologies, Inc.\n\nComputer Technology\n\n-\n\nSmall Business lnll0~ati0n~\n(Continued)\n\nSince 1983, when NASA initiated its SBIR\nprogram, the agency has sponsored some\n1,500 Phase I projects and more than 40 percent of them have progressed through Phase\n11. Roughly a third of the latter have generated spinoff commercial applications.\nAmong additional examples of\nspinoff developments that emerged from\nthe NASA SBIR program is Document\nDirectorTM, a software system of innovative\npowerful tools for automating the requirements process in large programs.\nDocument Director was developed\nfor NASA by Bruce G. Jackson & Associates,\nInc. (BGJM) , Houston, Texas, a consulting\nfirm serving NASA and NASA contractors in\nrequirements development, analysis, management and control. In 1986, BGJM started development of an automated tool that\ncombined word processing and database\nmanagement technologies. The resulting\nsuccessful development became Document\nDirector, a family of software\npackages intended to improve\nthe quality of requirements/\nspecifications and provide effective control throughout the life\ncycle of the program. Its key\nadvantage is the integration of\nword processor and database\nmanager, which offers the flexibility and convenience of text\nprocessing capability together\nwith the linking capability of\ndatabase management.\nSince problems associated with requirements induce\nprogram cost overruns and\nschedule delays, Document\nDirector also offers potential for\nimproved control of costs and\nschedules. Document Director\n\nI\n\nsays BGJM, "provides a means to collect\nand manage all information associated with\nrequirements development and to access\nthe information in the manner that best\nsupports the user."\nDocument Director was used by\nNASA in its program to design the Assured\nCrew Return Vehicle intended to return\nastronauts from the Space Station in an\nemergency; significant time savings were\nrealized during the planning process. The\nfirst version of Document Director was\nreleased in 1988 and since then there have\nbeen three major upgrades. The software\nsystem is used by several government and\nindustry organizations in addition to NASA.\nAt left, Randolph W. Folck, quality assurance\nengineer at Southwest Research Institute\n(SwRI), San Antonio, Texas is pictured working with Document Director; SwRI uses the\nsystem regularly in managing research projects for the electric power industry and\nother clients.\nAnother outgrowth of the NASA\nSBIR program is a software package to facilitate development of interfaces between resident and host data base management systems. The software package was developed\nfor Goddard Space Flight Center by Ken\nWanderman & Associates, Inc., (KWAI),\nStaten Island, New York; Ken Wanderman\nand associate Dr. Marsha Moroh, vice president and head of software research develop\nment, are pictured at bottom left. This\nwas one of several SBIR projects associated\nwith a Goddarddeveloped system known\nas DAVID (DistributedAccess View Integrated\nDatabase).\nDAVID was developed as a solution\nto a problem associated with the diversity of\nNASA information systems. There are many\ndatabase formats; there are a variety of com-\n\nbeen installed at a number of data centers,\nincluding the National Space Science\nData Center.\nSoftware innovations developed\nunder Ames Research Center\'s SBIR\nprogram include two helicopter codes\ndeveloped by Continuum Dynamics, Inc.\n(CDI),princeton, New Jersey.\nOne is EHPIC (Evaluation o Hover\nf\na\nPerformance Using Inpuence Coefficients),\nprogram used in helicopter design to predict\nthe engine power required for a helicopter\nto hover. Such prediction is important, but\ndifficult. The primary complication is calculating the effect of the wake of disturbed air\ntrailed by a rotor blade on its neighboring\nblade (left). The EHPIC free wake model\nproduces converged, freely distorted wake\ngeometries that generate very accurate analysis of wake-induced downwash; this, in turn,\nallows good predictions of rotor thrust and\npower requirements. CDI has licensed the\nEHPIC code to three of the four major U.S.\nrotorcraft manufacturers.\nA second CDI product is\nRotorCRAFT, a program for analysis of aerodynamic loading of helicopter blades in forward flight, a major concern in helicopter\ndesign. In particular, an accurate model of\nunsteady aerodynamic loading is required to\nunderstand and alleviate the sources of\nvibration in helicopters. Using some of the\nwake modeling tools developed for EHPIC,\nCDI developed the R o t o r C m code,\nwhich has demonstrated good correlation of\nmeasured rotor airloads, an important part\nof vibration prediction. The code has been\nlicensed to Sikorsky Aircraft Division of\nUnited Technologies.\n\n1\n/\n\nmercial and in-house database management\nsystems supporting a number of databases;\nand there are large quantities of data stored\nin sequential files, data that can only be\naccessed by specially written programs. This\nsituation led to difficulties for scientists trying to access information stored in a different format from their own. DAVID was\ndeveloped to act, in part, as a central database management system.\nThe contribution of KWAI involved\ndevelopment of software tools that facilitate\nuniform access to databases, either commercial database management systems or arbitrary file formats. The KWAI software is\ndivided into two parts: a number of interfaces, or bridges, between DAVID and commercial database management systems; and\nartificial intelligence programs that interact\nwith a human data engineer to solicit information and automatically generate DAVID\ninterfaces to their data.
