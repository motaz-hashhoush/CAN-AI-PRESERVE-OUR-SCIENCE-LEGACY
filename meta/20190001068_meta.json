Liquid water is not stable on its surface. There are no lakes, seas, or oceans, and rain falls nowhere at no time during the year. Yet early in its history during the Noachian epoch, there is geological and mineralogical evidence that liquid water did indeed flow on its surface creating drainage systems, lakes, and possibly, seas and oceans. The implication is that early Mars had a different climate than it does today, one that was based on a thicker atmosphere with a more powerful greenhouse effect that was capable of producing an active hydrological cycle with rainfall, runoff, and evaporation. Since Mariner 9 began accumulating such evidence, researchers have been trying to understand what kind of a climate system could have created greenhouse conditions favorable for liquid water. Unfortunately, the problem is not yet solved.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190001068, "endDate": "2014-07-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Institute", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "meetingId": "8b29deb6ae6b463c9e52c6c557a96c99", "id": "934ea2ce83a74a7eb24ed11a375d130a"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Universities Space Research Association (USRA)", "location": "Columbia, MD, United States"}}, "meetingId": "8b29deb6ae6b463c9e52c6c557a96c99", "id": "cf202a628a5b47cca50d0a1b425a4fb9"}], "name": "International Conference on Mars", "location": "Pasadena, CA", "id": "8b29deb6ae6b463c9e52c6c557a96c99", "startDate": "2014-07-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190001068, "id": "71643819db72462492aa4e1dc81000db", "publicationDate": "2014-07-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190001068.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190001068/downloads/20190001068.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190001068/downloads/20190001068.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190001068/downloads/20190001068.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
