This void created an opportunity to re-architect the launch site to be more accommodating to the future NASA heavy lift and commercial space industry. The goal is to evolve the heritage capabilities into a more affordable and flexible launch complex. This case study will discuss the FlS architecture evolution from the trade studies to select primary launch site locations for future customers, to improving infrastructure; promoting environmental remediation/compliance; improving offline processing, manufacturing, & recovery; developing range interface and control services with the US Air Force, and developing modernization efforts for the launch Pad, Vehicle Assembly Building, Mobile launcher, and supporting infrastructure. The architecture studies will steer how to best invest limited modernization funding from initiatives like the 21 st elSe and other potential funding.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "South Africa", "submissionId": 20110009975, "endDate": "2011-10-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Astronautical Federation", "location": "Paris, France"}}, "meetingId": "b8a737c50ba54418ac19794ce0cc22a4", "id": "6a54524e9f9b4fe393a62318e1cc16e8"}], "name": "International Astronautical Congress 2011", "location": "Cape Town", "id": "b8a737c50ba54418ac19794ce0cc22a4", "startDate": "2011-10-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110009975, "id": "38322671c11940b8877c25d71fbc9ec1", "publicationDate": "2011-10-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110009975.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110009975/downloads/20110009975.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110009975/downloads/20110009975.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110009975/downloads/20110009975.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
