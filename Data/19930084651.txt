f i l l e d cylinder i n which a piston moves.\n\nThe piston\n\ni s pierced by a number of small holes, allowing the o i l t o flow from\nside t o side, but offering considerable resistance t o its rapid pass-\n\nage.\n\nwhen the wheels s t r i k e the ground the motion o f the axle\nI\n\nforces the piston upward i n the cylinder, and the o i l , resisting i t s v\n\n- 5 -\n\nmotion, exerts an approximately constant f o\nt h e movement of t h e a x l e and corresponding t o t h e force\nbe applied by a rubber shock absorber i f one were used.\n\nI n addi-\n\nt i o n t o the holes d r i l l e d through t h e piston, a valve held shut by\na spring i s generally used t o keep t h e r e s i s t b g force more nearly\n\nconstant than it would be i f t h e o i l could only flow through holes\nof constant size, and t o keep t h e o i l pressure from rising t o\n\nSO\n\nhigh a figure i n a bad landing t h a t it would be l i k e l y t o burst the\n\ncylinder.\nWhen the oleo gear i s used it must be supplemented By a light\nspring t o return the piston t o the bottom o f t h e cylinder, as the\nshock absorber i t s e l f would have no tendency t o r e t u r n t o i t s o r i g i nal condition.\n\nThe combination of spring and oleo gear can usually\n\nbe made t o weigh l e s s than a spring alone, and there seems t o be no\ndoubt t h a t t h e present arrangement of rubber cord will, a t l e a s t on\n\nl a r g e airplanes, where the saving i n weight more than counterbalanceE\nt h e disadvantage of t h e increased complexity of the mechanism, u l t i mately be superseded By something i n t h e nature of a hydraulic device.\n\nThe l i f e of t h e landing gear w i l l be lengthened and i t s weight\n\nr educ ed\n\n.\nTravel of t h e Axle.\n\nThe actual force of t h e impact of t h e airplane against the\n\nground, a very important matter from the point of view of the designer, i s dependent on t h e type of shock absorber, on the s o r t of landing made, and on the distance through which the axis i s allowed Lo\n\ntravel.\n\n6 -\n\nThe last of thega'hterng i s of gseat ii-apoxtancei\n\n0\n\nit takes more a c t u a l force t o bring an airplane t o r e s t i n three\n\ninches of v e r t i c a l movement than i n three times t h a t dista\nplanes t o be flown by u.nski11ed p i l o t s , then, o r those which a r e 11a b l e t o have t o make forced, landings a t night o r on bad f i e l d s ,\nshould have allowance f o r ample t r a v e l of t h e axle, i n order that\nt h e impact loads, in landing, may not be large enough t o cause the\nlanding gear o r body s t r u c t u r e t o f a i l ,\n\nEven a very bad landing\n\ncan be made w i t h s a f e t y i f t h e landing gear was designed \xe2\x82\xacor rough\ntreatment-\n\nI n f a c t , i t i s possible, by using shock absorbers with\n\ns u f f i c i e n t v e r t i c a l yield, t o produce an airplane which can be\nflown straight i n t o the ground on i t s normal angle of descent, no\nf l a t t e n i n g . o f t h e path bePore contace being necessary.\n\nIn t h i s con-\n\nnection, again, the oleo gear presents d i s t i n c t advantages.\n\nIt is\n\neasy t o design a cylinder i n which a p i s t o n w i l l t r a v e l f o r 15\ninches o r more, but an arrangement of rubber cord becomes rather\nbulky and awkward when an attempt i s made t o allow f o r such l a r g e\nv e r t i c a l movements.\n\nI\nF\n\nWhen rubber i s depended on, t h e e f f e c t i v e trav-\n\ne l of t h e axis i s seldom more than seven inches a t most.\nShock-absorbing mechanisms can, i n general, be said t o be very\ne f f e c t i v e a t present.\n\nThere w i l l undoubtedly be f u r t h e r improve-\n\nments, however, and they should be directed primarily toward t h e use\n\nof some material more durable than rubber and tovard the development\nof devices which w i l l reduce the p i l o t i n g skill required t o make a\ns a t i s f a c t o r i l y smooth landing under adverse conditions,\n\n"
