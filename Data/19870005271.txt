The holes are arranged\nin zones 41-44. The vacuum is repeatedly interrupted\nat only one or a few zones (such as 4 3 1 , while it\ncontinues to be applied to other zones, to allow the\nworkpiece to creep along that interrupted zone. The\nvacuum to different zones is interrupted at different\ntimes, as by a slowly turning valve member 52, to allow\nA positive\neach zone of the workpiece to creep.\npressure may be applied from a pressured air source 59\nto a zone when the vacuum is interrupted there, to help\nlift the corresponding workpiece zone off the surface\nto\naid\nin creeping.\nThe workpiece may undergo\ndimensional changes because\nof heating, cooling,\ndrying, or other procedure.\nThe major novel feature is interrupting the vacuum\nto different zones of a support surface at different\ntimes, to allow a thin workpiece to change dimensions\nwhile it continues to be held down.\n\nI\n\ni\n\n46\n\nFIG.

A\nvacuum hold-down can be used to hold the sheet while it\nis baked.\nHowever, it is found that the sheet is\nsubject to cracking as it shrinks, due to the vacuum\nholding all portions of the original sheet in their\noriginal positions.\nA device for holding thin\nworkpieces\nagainst\na surface, which enabled the\nworkpieces to change dimensions while they continued to\nbe held closely against the surface, would be of value\nin the forming of the sheets described above as well as\nother thin workpieces that had to be heat treated.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:\nIn accordance with one embodiment of the\npresent invention, a hold-down device is provided for\n\n!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n-2-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n~\n\n15\n\nI\n\n20\n\n86/207\n\nholding a thin workpiece while it undergoes dimensional\nchanges, which permits creep of the workpiece to enable\ndimensional change thereof without deformity while\ncontinuing to hold the workpiece closely against a\nsupport surface.\nThe wall which forms the support\nsurface has a mulitiplicity of holes arranged in a\nplurality of zones. A means for applying vacuum to the\nholes to hold the workpiece against the surface, is\nconstructed to repeatedly stop applying the vacuum to\ndifferent of\nthe zones at different times while\ncontinuing to apply the vacuum to other zones. At the\ntime the vacuum is interrupted at the zone, the portion\nof the workpiece at that zone can creep along the\nsupport surface, and yet that zone of the workpiece is\nheld substantially to the support surface by the vacuum\napplied to adjacent zones.\nThe novel features of the invention are set\nforth with particularity in the appended claims. The\ninvention will be best understood from the following\ndescription when\nread\nin\nconjunction with the\naccompanying drawings.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:\nFig. 1 is a perspective view of a vacuum\nhold-down constructed in accordance with one embodiment\nof the present invention.\n25\nFig. 2 is a view taken on the line 2-2 of Fig.\n1.\n\nFig. 3 includes a series of graphs showing the\nvariation of pressure with time at each of the zones of\nthe apparatus of Fig. 2.\n30\nFig.\n4\nis a perspective view of another\nhold-down device of the invention.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS:\nFigs. 1 and 2 illustrate a vacuum hold-down\n\n4\n\n-3-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n86/207\n\ndevice 10 which can hold a thin workpiece 12 against a\nsupport surface 14 while the workpiece undergoes a\nchange in dimensions. Such change is usually a result\nof heat treating of the workpiece, as by heating and\ncooling it within an oven 15. The device includes an\nupper wall 16 which forms the support surface, and a\nmultiplicity of holes 18 in the upper wall for applying\na vacuum to the workpiece resting on the support\nsurface to hold the workpiece tightly against the\nsurface.\nA group of conduits 21-24 couple a vacuum\nsource 26 to corresponding plenums 31-34 that lead to\nthe holes to apply vacuums to the holes.\nIn prior art vacuum hold-downs, the vacuum was\napplied\ncontinuously while the workpiece was heat\ntreated.\nWhere the workpiece undergoes a significant\nchange\nin lateral dimensions L and W (which are\nperpendicular to the thickness dimension T of the thin\nworkpiece) while its temperature changes or a solvent\nof the like is driven from the workpiece, damage can\noccur to the workpiece.\nIf the workpiece contracts,\nthen tears can arise in the workpiece as the different\nportions draw apart, while if the workpiece expands,\nlocalized areas may develop wrinkles.\nIn one manufacturing operation for producing\nthin sheets, often referred to as tapes, for use in\nmanufacturing\noxygen membranes,\ndielectrics\nfor\ncapacitors, etc., a slurry is laid in a thin sheet and\ndried.\nThe dried sheet has the consistency of rubber,\nand is then placed on a surface where it is heat\ntreated in an oven, where it becomes brittle. During\nsuch heat treating, the tape or membrane shrinks. It\nis necessary to hold down the membrane during heat\ntreating, or else it will curl away from the surface\nand will not have a flat or predetermined curved shape\nwhich is required in a particular application.\nA\nvacuum hold-down device is effective in holding the\n\nj.1\n\nf.\n\n.,\n.\n\n-4-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n86/207\n\nmembrane to a predetermined configuration such as in a\nflat sheet, but it was found that the sheet would\ndevelop tears as it tended to shrink while being firmly\nheld by a vacuum against a support surface.\nIn accordance with the present invention, creep\nof the workpiece 12 is permitted while it continues to\nbe held to the support surface 14 by vacuum. The\nmultiplicity of holes 18 in the upper wall 16 of the\ndevice is arranged in a plurality of zones. In Figs. 1\nand 2, the holes are arranged in four zones 41-44 that\nare in the form of circles or rings at different\nspacings from a center or axis 46 of the device. The\nholes in each zone are coupled to a corresponding one\nof the plenums 31-34 by a corresponding one of the four\nconduits 21-24.\nEach of the conduits is coupled\nthrough a valve means or device 50 to the vacuum source\n26.\nThe valve device 50 operates to interrupt or\nrelieve the vacuum at the holes in at least some of the\nzones, so the pressure under the workpiece in each such\nrelieved zone is substantially equal to atomospheric\npressure, or ambient pressure where the furnace is at\nother than atmospheric pressure.\nSuch vacuum relief\nallows the portion of the workpiece in the relieved\nzone to creep, either radially inwardly or outwardly.\nBy alternating the vacuum relieved zones among\nmost or all of the zones, such creeping can progress\nacross\nsubstantially the entire area of the thin\nworkpiece, to allow it to change dimensions. The fact\nthat the vacuum continues to be applied to some of the\nzones while one or more of the others is relieved,\nresults in the workpiece being held down to the surface\nat a location near the relieved zone, so that the\nworkpiece cannot curl or bend more than a very small\ndistance away from the support surface at the relieved\nzone.\nThen, when the vacuum is reapplied to the\npreviously relieved zone, the workpiece is again held\n\n-5-\n\n86/207\n\ndown\nto\nthe support surface at that zone.\nBY\nrepeatedly altering the relieved zone, creeping can\ncontinue\nthroughout heat\ntreating, to produce a\nworkpiece whose shape closely conforms to that of the\n5 support surface, but which can be free of tears and\nwrinkles.\nIn Fig. 2, the valve 50 includes a blocking\nmember 52 that rotates in a direction 54, to relieve\nthe pressure in conduit 24, then conduit 23, then\n10 conduit 22, and finally conduit 21. Thus, the relief\nzone progresses\nradially\ninwardly to permit the\nworkpiece to shrink radially inwardly towards the axis\n46.\nIt may be noted that since the centermost zone 41\nis at the center, it may not be necessary to repeatedly\n15 relieve the vacuum thereat. When the valve member 52\nis blocking a particular conduit such as 23, air from\nthe outside 56 is allowed to leak into the plenum 33\nthrough a small leakage hole 58 leading from the\nenvironment at the same pressure as the area above the\n20 workpiece, into the plenum 3 3 .\nIt is possible to apply\na slight positive pressure to the plenum such as 33\nwhen the vacuum applied to the conduit such as 23 is\nrelieved, to help break that zone of the workpiece away\nfrom the support surface to facilitate its creeping.\n25 This can be accomplished by coupling each bleed hole\nthrough a conduit 57 to a source 59 of air at a\npressure slightly higher than the ambient pressure\nabove the workpiece.\nFig. 3 includes graphs 61-64 which indicate the\n30 variation in pressure with time at each of the groups\nof holes at each zone 41-44. The pressure in each zone\nvaries between a pressure A equal to ambient pressxire,\nand a pressure V equal to a vacuum pressure. It can be\nseen that the removal of vacuum as indicated at 71-74\n3 5 progresses radially inwardly along the zones and then\nrepeats.\nThe period during which the vacuum is\n\n-6-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n86/207\n\nrelieved throughout all zones whose vacuum is to be\nrelieved, should occur during a change in dimensions of\nthe unrestrained workpiece of no more than 1%. This is\nbecause most materials, other than elastomers, tend to\nbecome permanently deformed (and may tear or wrinkle)\nwhen their dimensions change more than on the order of\n1%.\nThe period during which the vacuum is no longer\napplied to each zone should be long enough so that the\npressure in the plenum under the holes in the zone can\nfall to substantially ambient pressure (or rise to\nslightly above ambient pressure where positive pressure\nis applied).\nIn one device of the type shown in Fig.\n2 , the valve member 52 makes one rotation about every\nfour seconds, so that during a period of several\nminutes while the tape is heat treated, there are many\nvacuum relief cycles during which the workpiece can\ngradually\ncreep along the support surface as its\ndimensions change.\nFig. 4 illustrates another vacuum hold-down\ndevice 80 which has a wall 82 with holes 84 arranged in\neight zones 91-98 that are substantially pie-shaped and\nwhich are angularly spaced about the axis 99 of the\nA valve 100 connects a vacuum source\nsupport surface.\nthrough each of eight conduits 101-108 to the eight\nzones.\nThe zone to which ambient or slightly above\nambient pressure is applied, rotates around the axis\n99.\nThus, each pie-shaped area of the workpiece can\ncreep inwardly or outwardly at one time.\nIt is\npossible to have some holes near the intersection of\ntwo zones lie in both zones to facilitate creep.\nThus, the invention provides a vacuum hold-down\ndevice which permits a tnin workpiece to undergo a\ndimensional change\nin\nits width and/or length,\nespecially as the temperature of the workpiece changes,\nto avoid tearing or wrinkling of the workpiece. This\nis accomplished by repeatedly relieving the vacuum at\n\nF'\n5\n\n-7-\n\n5\n\n86/207\n\ndifferent zones at different times during the change in\ndimensions of the workpiece.\nAlthough\nparticular\nembodiments of\nthe\ninvention have been described and illustrated herein,\nit is recognized that modifications and variations may\nreadily\noccur\nto those skilled in the art, and\nis intended that the claims be\nconsequently,\nit\ninterpreted\nto\ncover\nsuch modifications\nand\nequivalents.\n\n86/207\n\nACTIVE HOLD-DOWN FOR HEAT TREATING\n\nABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE\nA vacuum hold-down is described, for holding a\nthin\nfilm workpiece while\nit undergoes\nlarge\ntemperature\nchanges and\ncorresponding dimensional\nchanges, which permits creep of the workpiece to avoid\n5 damage thereto while still holding it on a support\nsurface.\nThe support surface has a mulitiplicity of\nholes arranged in a plurality of zones. The vacuum is\nrepeatedly interrupted at the holes lying at different\nzones while it continues to be applied at the other\n10 zones, to permit creep of the workpiece at a zone when\nvacuum is not applied thereto.\n\n"
