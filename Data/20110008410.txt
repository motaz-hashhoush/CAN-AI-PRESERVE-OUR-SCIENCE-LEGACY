From a recent 20th century atmospheric\nreanalysis (1,2) winters with more frequent blocking persist over several decades and\ncorrespond to a warm North Atlantic Ocean, in-phase with Atlantic multi-decadal ocean\nvariability (AMV). Ocean circulation is forced by wind-stress curl and related air/sea heat\nexchange, and we find that their space-time structure is associated with dominant blocking\npatterns: weaker ocean gyres and weaker heat exchange contribute to the warm phase of AMV.\nIncreased blocking activity extending from Greenland to British Isles is evident when winter\nblocking days of the cold years (1900-1929) are subtracted from those of the warm years (19391968).\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\nThe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominant atmospheric mode of variability\nover the Atlantic with maximum values of the 20th century in the early 1990s, a reversal in\n1995/1996 winter and a return to moderately weak positive and negative fluctuations since then.\nParticularly, the NAO index does not exhibit any unusual changes in the transition from the late\n1990s to the 2000s which could impact the upper ocean circulation. However, a major shift in\nthe North Atlantic surface currents as measured by surface drifter paths has occurred recently\nwhere branches of the North Atlantic Current veered north-eastward after 2001 (beginning in\nmid-1990s and intensifying after 2001) from their preferential path towards the south-east (as\nobserved since the beginning of the drifter program in 1989) (3). This change in the surface\ncurrents, bringing more warm and saline waters from subtropics has significantly contributed to\nincreased salinity in the subpolar gyre and in the waters flowing to the Nordic Seas (4).\nThe subpolar Atlantic salinity (and temperature) fluctuations have a multi-decadal\ncharacter such that similar high salinity (and warm) conditions dominated from the 1920s to the\n1960s (with some interannual fluctuations); fresher (and cold) conditions dominated from 1970s\nto the 1990s (5). Based on the 50-year reanalysis (1958-2007) of ocean hydrographic data\n(Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) data set (6)), high salinity events are associated with\nan increased transport of the most saline component (over 35.3 psu) of the North Atlantic\nCurrent (7). The atmosphere drives ocean circulation through both heat and moisture exchange\nand winds; the curl of the wind-stress in particular causes downward or upward pumping of\nwaters which energize the circulation gyres. Analysis of the wind stress curl showed that the\nbursts of the most saline transport were associated with atmospheric regimes having a curl\nanomaly, which opposes the climatological curl field, i.e. when the wind-driven gyre component\n\n3\n\nis weak. And indeed, the long decline of subpolar gyre surface currents from 1994 to 2000\nrevealed by satellite altimetry (8) correspond with a weakening wind-curl field. Impacts on\nmarine ecosystems of this ocean circulation variability mode, based on fish-catch and pilotwhale observations carrying back over several centuries, have been documented (9).\nLikely the most dramatic climate event of the 20th Century, the pre-greenhouse-gas\nnorthern warming that began in the 1920s and lasted through the 1960s, is a part of an irregular\ncycling known as Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV, or Atlantic Multi-decadal\nOscillation, AMO), The AMV/AMO is apparent in the subpolar gyre and also dominates the\nentire North Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) variability (10, 11).\n\nThis SST\n\nmode has been considered to be an important modulator for the Atlantic hurricane activity (11).\nAMO can be linked to many other multi-decadal climate impacts, e.g. NE Brazil and Sahel\nrainfall, North American and European summer climate (12). Hydrographic data analysis also\nshows that the subsurface temperature variability contains a signal of the multi-decadal mode\nwith an opposite tendency between the upper and deeper ocean (13).\nRelationship between the NAO index and the atmospheric regime with enhanced saline\n(subtropical) water intrusions to the northernmost latitudes is not firmly tied to the negative\nphase of NAO. Using another technique to classify atmospheric regimes such as cluster analysis\n(e.g. 14 and 15 and references therein) one can uncover a set of four clusters where NAO\nnegative and NAO positive emerge as separate clusters along with \xe2\x80\x98Atlantic Ridge\xe2\x80\x99 and\n\xe2\x80\x98Blocking\xe2\x80\x99 clusters. The Atlantic Ridge cluster, a single center of variability in the subpolar gyre\nsouth of Iceland, has been very active since year 2000 (15). The cluster analysis highlights the\nasymmetry of the NAO negative and NAO positive regimes such that sea level pressure (SLP)\ncenters are not co-located. This asymmetry between negative and positive NAO states can be\n\n4\n\nespecially obvious at the upper level winds (i.e. in the jet stream): If 300hPa winds are\ncomposited against the daily NAO index (from e.g. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) based\nSLP analysis), a SW to NW subpolar jet separated from the subtropical jet exists in NAO\npositive periods and a single continuous subtropical jet crossing the Atlantic exists during the\nnegative NAO periods (Figure 1 in (16)). In the negative NAO case the upper level winds form\nan anticyclonic pattern over the subpolar ocean. At extremes, this high-pressure pattern can\nblock the westerlies over the subpolar ocean, hence these events are called Greenland blocking\nepisodes. They have long been known to be accompanied with unusually cold winter\ntemperatures in Europe (17). Particularly cold winters of 1963 and 2009/2010 in the western\nEurope have been associated with blocking (18). North Atlantic blocking represents an extreme\nstate of the eddy-driven jet stream, with large-amplitude waves at the dynamical tropopause level\ndistorting, \xe2\x80\x98breaking\xe2\x80\x99 and impeding the normal westerly circulation by locating high-pressure\nanticyclones in their path (19). (An example of Atlantic blocking is given in Figure S1.)\nBlocking is not limited to the region surrounding the southern Greenland, but the\nblocking events are also very frequent in a band crossing over from Greenland to the British Isles\nwith a climatological maximum of winter blocking days over the British Isles if one uses an\nabsolute geopotential height index of (20) (figure 2a in (21); also the long term average blocking\ndays from the 20th century reanalysis shown in Figure S2). Similar emphasis on the peak of\nblocking days over Europe appears in a tropopause/potential temperature based index (22).\nBlocking over the western Europe occurs typically during a positive NAO phase (21).\nIn the following we will show that the winters with high number of blocking days are\nmost likely to result in the wind stress curl pattern which we found to be common during the\nsaline episodes of the 1960s, late 1970s (weak event) and early 2000s (7). We will show that the\n\n5\n\nchanges of blocking days also appear to be linked to AMV so that the decades with more\nblocking days are associated with positive SST anomalies over the North Atlantic. While\nblocking near Greenland has been associated with the negative NAO index (e.g., (19)), the\nparticularly strong episode of subpolar warming in the early 2000s was not associated with\nstrongly negative NAO, but with increased blocking activity from Greenland to western Europe\nleading to weakening of wind-stress curl and decreased heat loss over the subpolar Atlantic.\n\nData\nThe data sources for our study are the wind stress, 500hPa heights, sensible and latent\nheat flux and SLP data from National Center for Environmental Prediction and National Center\nfor Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis 1951-onwards, and from a 20th Century\nReanalysis (1,2) for 1900-2008. The wind stress curl is a derived product compiled to December\nto March averages. We also computed the number of blocking days in December to March time\nframe from the daily 500hPa height data. All analyses are performed with the 20th century data,\nexcept for comparisons made with modern NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data.\nWe use the Hadley Center sea surface temperature (SST) from 1901 onwards for linkages\nto Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation. The years 1925-1970 and 1971-1995 constitute the warm\nand cold phase of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (10). Other definitions of cold and\nwarm years also have been used in the literature, such as 1900-1929 and 1939-1968 (23), which\nare adopted here for the cold and warm period.\n\n6\n\nClimate regimes defined by wind-stress curl\nStorms, through their frequency, track-line and strength are imprinted in the wind stress,\nwhich forces the ocean through its vorticity (curl) and Ekman transport. The wind stress curl\nvariability acts as a critical forcing for changes in the ocean gyre circulation, hence indices for its\nvariability could be used to classify climate regimes important for ocean climate. To create\nindices of climate variability we choose the EOF analysis of the winter (December through\nMarch) wind stress curl for the full 20th century reanalysis (and for the 60-year NCEP/NCAR\nReanalysis for comparison). Both datasets give essentially the same EOF patterns and\namplitudes. EOF1 (Figure 1a, top) has a center west of the British Isles and its time series\n(principal component, PC, in Figure 1b) correlates highly with the NAO index. It has a center of\naction straddling the boundary between subpolar and subtropical gyres. EOF2 shown for the\n20th century analysis (Figure 1a, bottom) displays maximum amplitude of activity located over\nthe ocean gyres and its time series, PC2, is shown Figure 1b. The 2nd mode represents the\nmodulation of climatological pattern and hence the strength of the gyre circulation.\nNCEP/NCAR and 20th century reanalysis data sets give almost identical time series for the latter\nhalf of the century.\nFor the recent decades, 1960-2005, the PC2 timeseries of the wind stress curl was found\nto be the key index associated with the saline and warm periods in the northern North Atlantic\nOcean because it controls the expansion/contraction and strength of both subpolar and\nsubtropical gyres (7). With a longer atmospheric reanalysis we can now address climate regimes\nassociated with the SST variability such as the AMV. Our focus is on the wind stress curl PC2\nof the EOF analysis, but PC1 is invoked to distinguish the regime associated with curl EOF2\n\n7\n\nfrom NAO associated variability.\n\nWe primarily form composites of various quantities in the\n\natmospheric reanalysis corresponding to negative and positive events in curl PC2 (and/or PC1)\nexceeding one standard deviation to highlight the North Atlantic climate regimes. All analysis\nresults displayed, excepting Figure 2, are computed solely using the 20th century reanalysis data.\n\nDecadal variability of the blocking days\nThe number of wintertime blocking days (from December to March) was determined\nfrom the daily 500hPa height data. We used the definition (20) based on north-south dynamic\nheight gradient at 500hPa over the latitude range 30N-75N at each longitude and requiring\npersistence of at least 5 days. Blocking indices based on reversals of the meridional gradient of\npotential temperature at the tropopause have refined the description of blocking modes, yet they\nyield a similar picture to the (20) index in our region of interest (20). We further summed these\nblocking days into decadal fields shown in Figure 2a. The shown decadal fields up to 1950 are\nfrom the 20th century reanalysis and after 1951 the blocking days are from NCEP/NCAR\nReanalysis. The 20th century reanalysis tends to overestimate blocking days compared with the\nNCEP/NCAR in the overlapping period (Figure S3). However, it is obvious that some decades\ndisplay more prominently blocking activity than others. Especially, when the blocking is active\nover the British Isles and has an extension towards Greenland, the warmest periods occur in the\nNorth Atlantic Ocean, i.e., 1920-1970, and after 2000. This association is evident in Figure 2b\nshowing the time series of blocked days in a region (45 N-65 N, 10 E-70 W) and AMO-index\nwhich is the area averaged SST over the North Atlantic region 0 N-65 N, 10 E-80 W.\n\n8\n\nRelationship between wind stress curl and sea level pressure (SLP); blocking signature\nSea-level pressure (SLP) is often used to characterize decadal climate variability. Here\nwe compare SLP with the field of primary interest for ocean circulation, the wind-stress curl.\nThe wind stress curl EOF2 mode acts as a modulation of the climatological pattern that creates\nthe gyres. Hence we can call its timeseries PC2 the \xe2\x80\x98gyre mode index\xe2\x80\x99. Wind-stress curl relates\nto the vorticity of the winds, hence to the Laplacian of SLP which exhibits smaller-scale features.\nThe relationship of the gyre index to the leading SLP mode, NAO, is unclear, so we form an SLP\ncomposite corresponding to negative minus positive curl PC2 events. The resulting pattern\n(Figure 3a) resembles the NAO SLP pattern but the center of activity has shifted south and west.\nIt is similar to the Eastern Atlantic pattern in SLP EOF analysis (21, 24), and also to the Atlantic\nRidge pattern found with cluster analysis (14, 15). The Eastern Atlantic SLP pattern has been\nidentified as a blocking signature (21). This same SLP pattern, although only the southern center\nbetween 30N-40N, was recovered as a difference of warm years 1939-1968 minus cold years of\n1900-1929 (23). With a slightly different binning of the warm (1950-1964) and cold (19701984) years the SLP pattern resembles more the negative NAO pressure anomaly (25). The\n(lagged) time series associated with the multi decadal AMV temperature mode is also linked to\nthe Eastern Atlantic SLP pattern (13), but lagged by 11 years with the NAO index. While there is\nno spatial correlation between the NAO pattern and the wind curl EOF2, and the PC2 is not\nstrongly correlated with the NAO index, the PC2 time series shows remarkably close relationship\nwith the subpolar SLP anomaly (Figure 3b) and, less significantly, with the subtropical Azores\nSLP center. Observationally the relationship between the low frequency Azores SLP and ocean\ngyre variability arises from analysis of the sea level variability along the European coast (26).\n\n9\n\nRelationships between blocking, wind stress curl, heat flux and AMV\nTo establish the linkage between the wind stress curl variability and blocking we form\ncomposites using the two wind-stress curl modes PC1 and PC2 as indices with particular\nattention to the multi-year and multi-decade time scales. First the blocking activity\ncorresponding to PC1 (Figure 4a, as negative minus positive PC1 events) shows the Greenland\nblocking activity known to be associated with the negative phase NAO (16). On the other hand,\nthe PC2 composites (again as negative minus positive PC2 events, Figure 4b) show simultaneous\nactivity of the western European blocking and Greenland blocking, flanked by decreased\nblocking over Scandinavia and Southern Europe. This is in striking contrast to a simple\nassociation of Greenland blocking to the negative NAO index. This specific blocking anomaly\nreaching from Greenland to western Europe represents fluctuations of the basic climatologicalmean blocking pattern (Figure S2) with contributions also from positive NAO index. These\nNAO-positive contributions occur over the eastern side of the North Atlantic and western\nEurope.\nThe active blocking band from Greenland to the western Europe was also seen in decadal\nvariability of the extended early-midcentury warm period (Figure 2). In fact using the AMO\nindex (with no detrending; Figure 2b) to form a composite (positive minus negative) of the\nblocking events (Figure 4c) gives the same active band of blocking as the wind stress curl PC2\nalthough with less areas of significance. If we use the same years as in (23) to define warm\nperiod (1939-1968) and cold period (1900-1929), the resulting difference in blocking days\n(Figure 4d) has a pattern very similar to that corresponding to the curl PC2. The areas of\nsignificance of 95% or higher are stippled assuming maximum 58 degrees of freedom.\n\n10\n\nIn addition to the association of warm, saline ocean with weakening of the wind-stress\ncurl and the subpolar and subtropical gyre circulation, air-sea heat flux is a factor. The composite\nof turbulent (sensible and latent) heat flux corresponding to (negative minus positive) curl PC2\n(Figure 5) shows the heat flux anomaly associated with the climate regimes which have weak\ncirculation gyres and high blocking activity. This heat flux anomaly favors heating in large part\nof the North Atlantic including the Equatorial region with weak cooling in a narrow band in the\nmid-latitudes where the subtropical jet crosses the Atlantic. This heating anomaly pattern differs\nfrom that corresponding to the NAO index, where the subpolar heating/cooling is centered over\nthe Labrador Sea (instead of the central subpolar gyre) and the cooling/heating over the Gulf\nStream region is of the same order of magnitude as in the Labrador Sea.\nFigures 4 show that a similar blocking activity can be recovered whether using the gyre\nindex (wind stress curl PC2) or multidecadal SST variability as the compositing index. This is an\nimplication that the particular blocking anomaly is fundamental part of the forcing of the gyre\nvariability at low frequencies. Moreover it is associated with surface heat exchange which\nsupports heat content variability (Figure 5), in turn amplifying the effects of expanding and\ncontracting gyres.\n\nSummary\nVariability of atmospheric blocking over years to several decades shows correlation with\nthe ocean surface temperature and with significant changes in ocean circulation, mediated by\nwind-stress curl and air-sea heat exchange. The wind stress curl variability of most importance\nfor the North Atlantic gyre circulation represents amplitude modulation of the climatological curl\npattern. This same mode of variability is associated with a major shift in the upper ocean currents\n\n11\n\nafter year 2000. However the time series of the amplitude modulation has a weak relationship\nwith NAO which itself projects on a different curl pattern with a center of variability west of the\nBritish Isles between the subtropical and subpolar gyres. This motivated the search for other\nfeatures in the atmospheric forcing related to wind stress curl variability. With the 20th century\nreanalysis (1,2) we could also address the atmospheric conditions associated with the multidecadal (AMO/AMV) warming of the North Atlantic Ocean in mid-century.\nSince the wind stress curl variability represents changes in the Atlantic storm track, storm\nfrequency and intensity, we focused on persistent, i.e. blocking, events where storm tracks are\nshifted. For example with negative NAO index a block over southern Greenland forces the\nexistence of single upper level mid-latitude jet crossing the Atlantic. However our wind stress\ncurl pattern of interest, the gyre mode, is not projecting purely on the Greenland blocking but\ncontains an even more important component of the western European block centered on the\nBritish Isles. Hence we conclude that the modulation of the climatological curl pattern is created\nby the changes in the climatological blocking pattern consisting of blocked latitudes from both\nGreenland and western Europe. Increased activity of both, Greenland and western Europe,\nblocking centers has occurred when the North Atlantic has been in a warm state. PC2 affects\ngyre circulation, allowing increased northward penetration of warm subtropical waters during\nyears of high blocking activity. The same wind-stress curl mode also supports atmosphere-ocean\nheat exchange which sustains a warm state of the North Atlantic, from the subpolar region\nthrough most of the subtropics to the Equator.\nThe blocking events (lasting 5days \xe2\x80\x93 14days or more) provide on example of high\nfrequency atmospheric variability projecting on lower frequency variability of the wind stress\ncurl. Winters with more blocking days appear to persist for decades. Our analysis cannot\n\n12\n\nseparate cause and effect between high blocking activity and warm ocean surface but the existing\ntheory of the mid-latitude atmosphere-ocean interaction supports increased persistence of\natmospheric anomalies that created oceanic anomalies in the first place (27). The possibility of\ncoupled interaction of atmosphere (with Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability and at shorter\ntimescale) seems likely, given the long-period variability of blocking reported here, and in the\neven longer paleo-climate time series (28). The relation between the climatically important\nAtlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and AMV variability has not been\nestablished but AMV exhibits also vertical structure which could signal AMOC variability (13).\nInternal oscillation modes of ocean overturning circulation, AMOC (29, 30), may have been\nactive in weakening the subpolar gyre circulation in the mid-1990s. The idea is that the strong\natmospheric forcing immediately prior to 1995 strengthened the AMOC, bringing warm\nsubtropical waters northward, which then fed back negatively, initiating the weakening observed\nlater in the decade. Clearly, the possibility of phase-lagged feedbacks like this, reaching out to\nthe hemispheric jet-stream waveguide, to tropical ocean temperatures and to the AMOC itself,\nhave to be acknowledged. Our zero-phase-lag discussion is one step in that direction, associating\natmospheric blocking and weakened wind-stress curl with weakened ocean gyres and increased\npenetration of warm Atlantic subtropical waters poleward,\n\n13\n\nReferences:\n1.
