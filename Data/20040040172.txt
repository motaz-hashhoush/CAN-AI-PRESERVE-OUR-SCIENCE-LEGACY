Fan 3 was intended to build on the experience gained from Fans 1 and 2 by demonstrating noise reduction technology that surpasses 1992 levels by 6 dB.\nThe work was performed within the auspices of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) program, and\nunder Contract NAS3-27727 \xe2\x80\x93 Critical Propulsion and Noise Reduction Technologies for Future Commercial Subsonic Engines; Task 14.1: 22-in. Rig Program.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\niii\n\nABSTRACT\nThis NASA AST task was authorized to design and build the third fan (Fan 3) in a series of 22-in. diameter tip\nfan rigs for NASA testing at GRC. Fan 1 and Fan 2 were two low tip speed fans designed and tested as part of the\nNASA Large Engine Technology (LET) program under Contract NAS3-26618. This advanced high-bypass ratio\n(BPR) rig (Fan 3) was intended to build on the experience gained from Fan 1 and Fan 2 and demonstrate noise\nreduction technology that surpassed 1992 levels by 6 dB.\nFan 1 and Fan 2 both featured variable pitch advanced ducted propulsor (ADP) rotors designed for tip speeds\nof 840 and 756 ft/sec, respectively. The testing showed that Fan 2, although expected to be 2 dB quieter than Fan 1,\nwas found to be 1.7, 1.4 and -0.1 dB noisier for sideline, cutback, and approach, respectively.\nWork on this task was conducted in the areas of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code validation: acoustic\nprediction and validation; rotor parametric studies and fan exit guide vane (FEGV) studies, up to the time when a\nNASA decision was made to cancel the design; fabrication; and testing phases of the work. The decision was based\non financial concerns and the realization that similar information would be obtained from another 22-in. rig program. The scope of the program changed accordingly to concentrate on two subtasks:\n1. Rig data analysis and CFD code validation\n2. Fan and FEGV optimization studies.\nThe results of the CFD code validation work showed that this tool predicts three-dimensional (3-D) flowfield\nfeatures well from approximately the blade trailing edge to a chord downstream. The CFD tool loses accuracy as\nthe distance from the trailing edge increases beyond a blade chord.\nThe comparisons of noise predictions to rig test data showed that both the tone noise tool (TFaNS) and the\nbroadband noise tool (BFaNS) demonstrated reasonable agreement with the data to the degree that these tools can\nbe used reliably for design work.\nFan 1 and Fan 2 test data was analyzed for noise differences since the expected 2 dB noise reduction for Fan 2\nwas not realized. The scaling rules used for this prediction were:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe standard 50 log (tip speed) scaling factor for the reduced tip speed of Fan 2, which indicated a reduction of 2.5 dB\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe empirical 7 log (vane number) scaling factor from Boeing rig testing for broadband noise, which predicted a 0.4 dB increase.\n\nThe result was a net 2 dB broadband noise reduction. When using the BFaNS to evaluate Fan 2 the results confirm a noise increase on the order of 2 dB. These results show that the scaling rules initially used do not apply to the\ndifferent aerodynamic loading of these two fans.\nThe section on rig airflow and inlet separation analysis describes the method used to determine total fan airflow and shows the good agreement of predicted boundary layer profiles to measured profiles. The results of the\ninlet flow separation studies show separation angles of attack ranging from 29.5 degrees to 27 degrees for the range\nof airflows tested.\nThe results of the rotor parametric studies were significant in leading to the decision not to pursue a new rotor\ndesign for Fan 3. Noise predictions for a 750 ft/sec Fan 3 rotor showed little reduction compared to Fan 2, resulting\nin recommendations to concentrate efforts on FEGV stator designs. The ensuing parametric study on FEGV\ndesigns showed the potential for 8 to 10 EPNdB noise reduction relative to the baseline, with the configuration featuring 22 bowed vanes with 30 degrees of sweep demonstrating the greatest potential.\nA preliminary rig nacelle structural analysis was performed on the 22-vane configuration, bowed with 30\ndegrees of sweep, relative to the 52-vane configuration of Fan 1. The results showed the 22-vane configuration to\nbe significantly stiffer than the original in the torsional and axial directions and only slightly stiffer in the transverse direction. Stress results were not determined due to cancellation of this part of the program.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\nv\n\nCONTENTS\nSection\n\nPage\n\nFOREWORD ...................................................................................................................................................... iii\nABSTRACT ....................................................................................................................................................... v\n1.

INTRODUCTION\nMajor airports in the nation's air transportation system face a serious problem in providing greater capacity to\nmeet the ever increasing demands of air travel. This problem could be relieved if airports are allowed to increase\ntheir operating time, now restricted by curfews, and by relaxing present limits on takeoffs and landings. A key\noperational issue and feature in the argument against the extension of the present curfews is noise.\nIn response to increasingly restrictive noise regulations, NASA is conducting a noise reduction project as part\nof the AST program. The goal of the project is to reduce the noise level of aircraft by a cumulative 30 dB, relative\nto 1992 technology, by the end of the decade. This implies noise reduction of 10 dB in each of three aircraft flight\nphases where aircraft noise is measured: takeoff, sideline, and approach.\nAs part of noise reduction efforts in the fan section of aircraft engines, NASA has conducted rig testing on a\n22-in. fan/nacelle model. Two low tip speed fans with 22-in. diameter tip were designed and tested as part of this\nprogram. Reference 17 describes the design of a low noise fan stage (Fan 1) and Reference 11 describes the design\nof an advanced low noise fan stage (Fan 2). Both fans were variable pitch ADP rotors designed for tip speeds of\n840 and 756 ft/sec respectively. The testing, which was performed at NASA GRC, included acoustic, aerodynamic,\nand structural tests. Fan 2, although expected to be 2 dB quieter than Fan 1, was found to be nosier by 1.7, 1.4, and\n-0.1 dB for sideline, cutback, and approach, respectively.\nThe purpose of this report is to document the work completed for Fan 3. The initial purpose of this task was to\ndemonstrate further noise reductions than those demonstrated in Fan 1 and Fan 2, to achieve a noise objective of 6\ndB less than 1992 levels. After program initiation, work in the areas of CFD code validation, acoustic prediction\nand validation, rotor parametric studies, and FEGV studies were conducted up to the time when a NASA decision\nwas made to cancel the design, fabrication, and testing phases of this task. The decision was based on financial\nconcerns and the realization that similar information would be obtained from another 22-in. rig program. After the\ncancellation, the purpose of this task became one of validating CFD codes for fan aerodynamics and developing\nfan acoustic prediction tools.\nIn view of the above cancellation decision, the following work was completed:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nData analysis and code validation\n\xe2\x80\x94 CFD code validation involving comparisons of predicted-to-measured aerodynamic parameters for\nP&W's large scale (5 ft) research rig, the NASA/Allison 22-in. rig, and Fan 1.\n\xe2\x80\x94 Acoustic predictions of Fan 1 noise using aerodynamic test data.\n\xe2\x80\x94 Acoustic predictions of Fan 1 noise using predicted aerodynamic data.\n\xe2\x80\x94 Analysis of noise differences between Fan 1 and Fan 2 data.\n\xe2\x80\x94 22-in. rig nacelle aerodynamic analysis involving CFD predicted boundary layer analysis compared to\nmeasured test data, and an analysis of inlet distortion data to determine separation angle of attack.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFan Design Optimization Studies\n\xe2\x80\x94 Parametric design study of basic aerodynamic drivers of noise for selected rotor configurations.\n\xe2\x80\x94 FEGV parametric study to determine the drivers of noise for five stator vane configurations.\n\xe2\x80\x94 Structural analysis of the most promising FEGV configuration from the parametric study.\n\nThe results of the work done in this task are significant for advancing the development of fan noise prediction\ntools. The predictions made for Fan 3, using the results from Fan 1 and Fan 2, were influential in focusing efforts\non the FEGV, rather than on rotor characteristics.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n1-1\n\n2. DATA ANALYSIS AND CODE VALIDATION\n2.1\n\nCOMPARISONS OF CFD PREDICTIONS TO RIG TEST DATA\n\nP&W's 3-D CFD capability has been applied to three related fan configurations to understand the physics of\nhow the aerodynamic flowfield causes noise. The CFD code has been assessed by comparing mean wake profiles\nand turbulence predictions with available measured wake profiles and turbulence properties from United Technologies Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s (UTRC's) 5-ft rig, Allison Engine Company's (Allisons\xe2\x80\x99s) 22-in. fan,1 and the P&W/NASA\n22-in. Fan 1. P&W's CFD code is a cell centered pressure-based Navier-Stokes implicit flow solver with a k-\xe2\x88\x88 turbulence model (Reference 1 and 2). These three fan designs were chosen to aid in determining what factors are\ninvolved in accurately predicting wakes. It is believed that the three fan designs represent an adequate cross section\nof data, speeds, and geometry.\nCFD predictions were performed on UTRC\xe2\x80\x99s large scale 5 ft research rig to provide low tip speed fan data for\nthe evaluation of code accuracy. The UTRC rig was chosen because the measurement probe rotates with the rotor.\nThis assisted in determining the contribution of unsteady flow behavior by comparing CFD (relative frame) to\nphase locked laser doppler velocimetry (LDV) measured wakes.\nThe Allison test data from the 22-in. fan was used to provide an initial assessment of P&W's ability to predict\nrotor wakes. NASA provided rotor and endwall geometry, inlet total pressure, total temperature, and gas angles as\na function of radius to be used as CFD boundary conditions. NASA provided the reported pressure ratio and efficiency, as well as exit profiles, of pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and efficiency for near stall, a single point on\nthe fan map. P&W provided the predicted rotor exit wakes information prior to seeing the Allison test data and\nNASA made the comparisons to data in order to provide an objective assessment of P&W's predictive capability.\nThe Allison 22-in. fan was ideal, since noise and wake data at three different stations was available.\nCFD predictions were performed on the P&W/NASA 22-in. Fan 1 to provide a broader base of relevant low tip\nspeed fan data for evaluation of code accuracy. The profiles, wakes, and turbulence of the ADP Fan 1 rotor were\npredicted and compared to test results. This 22-in. fan was ideal, since noise and wake data at two stations were\navailable, with the second located over two chords downstream of the fan trailing edge.\n2.1.1 CFD Motivation and Background\nCFD accuracy requirements for a noise prediction system are higher than for an aerodynamic design system. In\nthe past, the fan designers were mostly interested in accurately predicting one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) fan performance, such as pressure ratio and efficiency. Today, as noise moves up near the top of priorities in fan design, accurate predictions of wake shapes, turbulence mixing, and other 3-D flow details become a\npriority. The goal of this task is two-fold: to assess and improve the prediction capability of such flow features and\nto gain understanding of fan noise sources like wakes and turbulence so that low noise fans can be designed.\n1\n\nAllison is a Rolls-Royce company.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n2-1\n\n2.1.2 UTRC 5-ft Rig\nThree flows were modeled (65, 85, and 95 percent axial velocity over the average of leading and trailing edge\nrotational velocities, or Cx/Um), and wake profile comparisons were completed at a 50 percent span. Figure 2-1\nillustrates the CFD model of the rig and shows wake profile comparison locations (labeled Station 1). Comparisons\nat 50 percent span and 10 percent chord downstream of the trailing edge are shown in Figure 2-2. The comparisons\nshow the CFD model to accurately predict the wake shape (deficit and width). Unfortunately, data at other locations has been lost and comparisons cannot be made. It is not known how well the model compares near the inner\ndiameter (ID) and outer diameter (OD) of the flowpath and a chord or two downstream. The wake comparisons in\nFigure 2-2 would indicate, however, that the blade losses are accurately predicted. While data was acquired from\n10 to 110 percent chord aft of the rotor at various incidences, the data is not accessible. Therefore, it is not possible\nto determine if the difference between predicted wakes and data is primarily due to phase-locking errors in the\nmeasurements.\n\nFigure 2-1.

Fan\nThis Allison 22-in. fan is an ideal\nfan for study, since noise and wake data\nat three different stations is available.\nNASA provided all the necessary input\nfor creating the CFD model (geometry,\nboundary conditions, and data) and\nP&W supplied CFD results to NASA\nfor data comparison.

Figure 2-4 shows\nwhere the comparison of the CFD model to data is performed on the map characteristic.\nFigure 2-5 shows the comparison of the CFD model to radial distributions of pressure ratio, temperature ratio,\nand efficiency at a data point. The CFD model compared very well to data at Station 2, matching both the level and\nshape of the profiles. Even the level of overshoot in the temperature ratio near the OD was predicted well.\nFigure 2-6 shows the wakes at the three stations through two parameters: the axial component of the velocity and\nthe turbulent kinetic energy. Comparisons of CFD model wakes to data wakes were performed and show excellent\nagreement out to Station 3 (about one chord downstream of the rotor trailing edge). The results, shown in\nFigure 2-7, show good agreement of wake deficit and width, from 14 to 79 percent span.\n\nEfficiency\n\n0.96\n\n0.94\n\nCFD: Point For Comparisons\n\n0.92\n\n0.90\n76\n\n78\n\n80\n\n82\n\n84\n\n86\n88\nInlet Corrected Flow\n\n90\n\n92\n\n94\n\n96\n\n98\n\n90\n\n92\n\n94\n\n96\n\n98\n\nPressure Ratio\n\n1.27\n\n1.25\nData: Near Stall Data Point\n1.23\n\n1.21\n76\n\n78\n\n80\n\n82\n\n84\n\n86\n\n88\n\nInlet Corrected Flow\n\nFigure 2-4.

Fan 1 is an ideal case to study, because both noise and wake data at two stations downstream of the\nrotor are taken. Figure 2-8 shows the data stations and all the relevant information describing the CFD model, as\nwell as the fan characteristics. Since these predictions are input to the fan noise prediction models, accuracy of the\nfull 3-D nature of the flowfield, such as fan wake size and shape and turbulence, are extremely important. In order\nto obtain the best match to data, several modeling issues became extremely important. The 3-D wake shapes were\ndependent on bypass ratio, modeling of the fan hub gap, correct tip clearance, grid wake resolution, and turbulence\ntransition modeling. All these parameters were specified to produce the best CFD/data match.\nFigure 2-9 shows where the CFD model to data comparison is performed on the map characteristic. The point\nof comparison is near the operating line and close to the point at which data was obtained. The comparison of the\nCFD model to data for radial distributions of pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and efficiency are shown in\nFigures 2-10 and 2-11. Figure 2-10 shows the comparisons in the core; Figure 2-11 shows the comparisons in the\nduct. There is a small miss in the CFD model prediction in the core. Figure 2-11 also shows errors in the data as\nwell; it is impossible to have efficiencies greater than 1.0, as the figure suggests.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n2-7\n\nFigure 2-8.

However, for noise prediction, further comparisons must be performed to provide\ninsight into the 3-D predictive capability for wakes and turbulence. Figures 2-12 and 2-13 show the wakes at\nStations 1 and 2 through five parameters: the absolute, relative, and upwash velocity (perpendicular velocity to the\nmean) and the absolute and relative air angles. These parameters are essential for accurate prediction of tone noise\nand were compared qualitatively to determine wake phasing and shape. The CFD model obtains a reasonable prediction of these properties, as evidenced by the accurate prediction of the radially-curved shape of the wakes at\nboth stations. However, Figure 2-13 (illustrating the flow through the duct) shows a mismatch between CFD\nmodel and data near the splitter (ID of the duct) and the OD of the duct.\nFigures 2-14 and 2-15 show comparisons of the CFD model to data of the wake deficit and width at Stations 1\nand 2 and various span locations. The comparison at Station 1 (about one chord downstream of the rotor trailing\nedge) shows generally good agreement. The CFD model is in excellent agreement with data for the width of the\nwake in the midspan region, but the depth of the wake is overpredicted. In the hub region, the wake width is considerably underpredicted. These results are similar to the results obtained by Chima (Reference 3). The comparison\nat Station 2 (about two chords downstream of the rotor trailing edge) shows worse agreement. The comparison in\nFigure 2-15 shows ID and OD discrepancies and misses in wake depth at midspan.\nFurther investigation showed the CFD models to more closely match data when a separation forms over the\nsplitter leading edge. This information was obtained by modeling half of the experimentally measured core flow.\nWhile this flow change is physically unlikely, it is useful to investigate these results. Figures 2-16 and 2-17 show\ncomparisons of the CFD models to data of the wake deficit and width at Stations 1 and 2 for half of the core flow.\nThese figures illustrate better agreement with data near the splitter at Station 2. The midspan to OD wake shapes\nwere not affected. Figure 2-18 illustrates how halving the core flow incurs a separation over the splitter leading\nedge. Once the separation forms, the profiles in the core and the duct compared better between CFD model and\ndata.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n2-11\n\nFigure 2-12.

The CFD tool predictability has been\nassessed to gain understanding of fan noise sources, such as\nwakes and turbulence. The resulting tool predicts 3-D flowfield features well, from the blade trailing edge to about a\nchord downstream. However, the CFD tool loses accuracy\nas the distance from the trailing edge increases beyond a\nblade chord. In addition, the comparisons of CFD model\npredictions to data hinge on several assumptions. These\nassumptions encompass any modeled geometric discrepancies with actual geometry, the modeled inlet turbulence profiles, modeled turbulence transition, and the modeled fan/\ncore flow split with test.\n\nFan\n\nDuct\n\nCore\nCenterbody\n\nSeparation\n\nAs Measured Flow\n\nHalf the Core Flow\n\n134165.cdr\n\n2.2\n\nCOMPARISONS OF NOISE PREDICTIONS TO\nRIG TEST DATA\n\nFigure 2-18.

The purpose of this section is to detail the fan design system and to validate this system with noise data.\nThe preliminary fan stage design is discussed in Section 2.4.\n2.2.1 Fan Noise Design System\nThe fan noise design system is shown in\nFigure 2-19. As is shown, fan noise is separated into\ntones and broadband. Both the TFaNS (References 4\nto 7) and the broadband-noise model (Reference 8\nto 10) were developed under NASA funding. The input\nto these codes includes the fan and FEGV geometry and\nperformance. Performance from a streamline curvature\ncode and a Reynolds number-averaged Navier-Stokes\ncode or from wake/turbulence test data may be used as\ninput. The tone- and broadband-noise codes will now be\ndescribed in further detail.\n\nTones\n(TFaNS)\n\nSOURCE3D\nInput File\nModified to\nAWAKEN\n\nAWAKEN\n\nInput Files\n\nRotor and Stator\nGeometry;\nStreamline\nCode\nPerformance\n\nCFD/Measure Aerodynamic Information\n\nBroadband\n(BFaNS)\n\nBroadband\nInput File\n\nSetup BFaNS\n\nFEGV Leading Edge\nNear Fan Leading Edge\nNear Fan Trailing Edge\n\nSOURCE3D\nBFaNS\n\nThe TFaNS contains three major codes to produce\nfan tone noise predictions (Figure 2-19):\nCUP3D\n\xe2\x80\xa2 AWAKEN CFD/Measured Wake Postprocessor\nTone Power Levels\nBroadband\ncreates a SOURCE3D input file that contains\nPower\nLevel Spectra\nupwash wake harmonic amplitudes calculated\n134166.cdr\nfrom CFD predictions or measured velocity\nFigure 2-19.

In addition, CFD\nor measured velocity information is obtained from an Acoustic Wake/Turbulence File. This latter file is\ngenerated by either a CFD code (or postprocessor) or from the analysis of data from an engine/rig test program.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SOURCE3D Rotor/Wake Stator Interaction Code (Figure 2-20) has two functions within the TFaNS: first,\nit calculates tone noise from a rotor wake/FEGV interaction, and second, it determines the scattering coefficients for the rotor and stator, and then outputs them to rotor and stator Acoustic Properties Files for use\nby CUP3D (see Reference 4). This code can either use its own internal semi-empirical wake model, or it\ncan use CFD or measured wakes processed through the AWAKEN CFD/Measured Wake Postprocessor.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n2-18\n\nRotor Acoustic Element\n\nStator Acoustic Element\nActuator Disk\nStraightens Flow\n\nActuator Disk\nTurns Flow\n\nRotor\n\n1\n\nAxial Flow\n+\nSolid Body\nSwirl\n\nAxial Flow\nStator\n\n2\n\n3\n\nInterface Planes\n134167.cdr\n\nFigure 2-20. TFaNS Tone Fan Noise Design/Prediction System\nAll fan wakes and cascade unsteady pressures (on the fan or stator) are calculated or applied using a strip theory. Unsteady pressure distribution calculations are performed assuming flat plate cascades for each strip with a\nsubsonic mean flow; hence, fans cannot be run supersonically. The noise calculation is completed by coupling the\ncascade unsteady pressures to acoustic modes that are assumed to be in a constant area annular duct with mean\naxial flow and solid body swirl (in between the fan and the FEGV). In addition, before the fan and aft of the stator\nare actuator disks that act to turn the flow, just as real blades and vanes would. This creates reflection and transmission effects in addition to those from the rotor and stator. The rotor and stator calculations are completed separately.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCUP3D Fan Noise Coupling Code is the central portion of the TFaNS. The code reads Acoustic Properties\nFiles that contain scattering (transmission and reflection) coefficients from SOURCE3D, as well as noise\nfrom the fan wake/stator interaction. This information is used to form a system of linear equations that permit the fan and the FEGV to reflect and transmit to each other. Output from this code includes inlet and aft\npower levels that are used during the design process.\n\nFor more information on these codes, see References 4 to 7.\nThe BFaNS has two major code calculations: The SetupBFaNS and the BFaNS (Figure 2-21). The SetupBFaNS obtains the geometry, performance, and flow turbulence from CFD predictions, streamline curvature code\npredictions, or measured data and organizes the BFaNS input file for the user. The BFaNS then uses this input file\nto predict noise sources shown in Figure 2-21.\nInlet Tip\nTurbulence\n\nSelf\nNoise\n\nRotor Tip\nTurbulence\n\nRotor Wake\nTurbulence\n\nRotor\n\nSelf\nNoise\n\nStator\n\nRotor Hub\nTurbulence\n\nInlet Hub\nTurbulence\n\n134168.cdr\n\nFigure 2-21.

Details of this modeling may be found in References 8\nto 10.\n2.2.2 Evaluation of the TFaNS and BFaNS with Data\nThe ADP 22-in. Fan 1 rig data was used to validate the TFaNS and BFaNS capabilities. The ADP 22-in. rig\nacoustic and aerodynamic test data was obtained at the NASA GRC 9 ft \xc3\x97 15 ft low speed wind tunnel. The fan\nstage contains 18 blades and 45 vanes and runs at a top fan tip speed of 950 ft/sec. The rig includes a fan, an FEGV,\nand a core duct (Figure 2-22). Acoustic data was obtained with a microphone traverse at a constant sideline distance from the model and was postprocessed to a constant farfield radius from the rig. Tone and broadband noise\nwas calculated by subtracting the broadband from the tone levels. Blade passing frequency (BPF) is cut off over the\nentire speed range in this rig. Reference 6 contains additional information on how this rig was configured for\nSOURCE3D.\n\nFigure 2-22. ADP 22-in. Rig Fan Cross Section\nVerification of the system includes predictions using semi-empirical wakes (for the TFaNS only), experimentally measured wakes and turbulence (using hot wire/LDV), or CFD-predicted wakes and turbulence. Measurement\nstations for the experiment are shown in Figure 2-23. As can be seen in this figure, in order to perform LDV and\nhot wire measurements, the FEGV was moved back. For the purposes of this study, the TFaNS predictions were\nbased on flow data from Station 2 and the BFaNS predictions based on data from Station 1.\n\nFigure 2-23. ADP 22-in. Rig Fan LDV/Hot Wire Measurement Stations\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n2-20\n\nFigure 2-24. ADP 22-in. Rig Fan 1 TFaNS Predictions Versus Data\nThe TFaNS tone-noise predictions are presented in Figure 2-24. Acoustic power level predictions were made\nusing the code's semi-empirical wakes across the speed range. In addition, acoustic power levels were predicted\nwith CFD-predicted wakes at the FEGV leading edge and LDV wake data from Station 2 (Figure 2-23). The two\nlatter predictions were only made at the three speeds where the LDV data was obtained.\nResults show that aft 2BPF data is well predicted using all prediction methods, but the best results are obtained\nfrom experimental or CFD wake data. Inlet 2BPF results vary, with prediction shapes not matching the data. Predicted levels match the data at different points along the operating line, depending upon the type of prediction. Inlet\nand aft 3BPF tend to be overpredicted by experimental and CFD wake data and are underpredicted by semi-empirical wakes below about 650 to 700 ft/sec. Semi-empirical predictions then appear to match the data above these tip\nspeeds.\nCFD wakes are shown against experimental wakes in Section 2.3.1 in Figures 2-12 through 2-15. These wakes\nwere employed at the FEGV leading edge to predict the noise above. The trailing edge of the stator is near the Station 2 measurement location (Figures 2-22 and 2-23) so that the FEGV leading edge is in between the two stations.\nFigures 2-12 and 2-13 show that the wake phasing of the upwash velocity, used to calculate noise, is relatively\nwell predicted by the CFD code at both Station 1 and Station 2.\nFigures 2-14 and 2-15 show the tangential CFD wake upwash predictions versus data at various spans for the\ntwo flow measurement stations. A comparison of CFD predictions versus data at the FEGV leading edge is not\navailable. However, noise predictions for the CFD wakes versus the LDV wakes at Station 2 predictions indicate\nthat there is more 3BPF content in the CFD wakes than the measured wakes. This makes sense since the Station 2\nCFD predictions versus experimental data show the CFD wakes to be thinner. Section 2.3.1 discusses the details of\nthese predictions.\nOverall, predictions tend to demonstrate reasonable agreement with data permitting the TFaNS to be used for\ndesign.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n2-21\n\n840 ft/sec\n\nFigure 2-25. ADP 22-in. Rig Fan 1 BFaNS Predictions Versus Data\nBroadband total power level noise predictions using the BFaNS are shown in Figure 2-25. Data is represented\nby symbols, whereas predictions are represented by lines. The top black line is the calculated total power level predictions. The other lines show the predictions for the various noise sources. Predictions here are shown for the three\noperating tip speeds where LDV data was measured. LDV turbulence and fan performance information is used for\nthese predictions at Station 1 (Figure 2-23).\nPredictions show good overall agreement with data. The predicted importance of a number of noise sources\nindicates the complicated nature of broadband noise. Vane generated noise sources, combined with fan self noise,\nappear to be significant. Fan tip turbulence interaction with the FEGV appears to produce the most important noise\nsource for this rig at the two highest powers. This will become an issue in the stator design process in Section 2.4.2.\nFigure 2-26 shows the circumferentiallyaveraged CFD-predicted fan-generated turbulence for ADP 22-in. rig Fan 1 at sideline power\nversus hot wire and LDV data at measurement\nStation 1. Results further reinforce the predicted\nimportance of the fan tip turbulence and FEGV\ninteraction. They also show that CFD models can\npredict the correct trends in circumferentially\naveraged noise, though the levels are underpredicted.\nThe above predictions for both tones and\nbroadband show the importance of wakes and\nturbulence generated by the fan.\nOverall, predictions tend to demonstrate reasonable agreement with data and permit the\nBFaNS to be used for design.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\nFigure 2-26.

These fans are designed to run on the same operating line, but Fan 2\xe2\x80\x99s\nsideline tip speed is designed to be 10 percent lower than that of Fan 1. This reduced tip speed was expected to\nreduce noise further beyond that already achieved with Fan 1.\nEffective perceived noise levels (EPNLs) for this effort were calculated using the standard aircraft flight path\nand takeoff gross weight (TOGW) (e.g., 850,000 lb TOGW with 56,000 lb thrust engines) for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s AST program. Based on previous work, Fan 1 and Fan 2 were scaled to a 130-in. diameter fan.\nBoth fans have 18 fan blades and a 22-in. diameter. Fan 1 has 45 FEGVs while Fan 2 has 51 FEGVs, designed\nfor low noise. The fan tip speeds at the various noise operating conditions are shown in Table 2-1.\nTable 2-1.

Table 2-2 indicates that, based on the standard 50 log\n(tip speed) scaling factor, fan tip speed reductions should reduce Fan 2 noise by 2.5dB relative to Fan 1. In addition, a 0.4dB increase is expected in the broadband noise due to the empirical 7 log (vane number) scaling factor\nfrom Boeing rig testing. Thus, a 2dB broadband noise reduction was expected.\nTable 2-3 illustrates what was actually observed from the data when Fan 1 and Fan 2 were compared. The\nengines were flown with:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBroadband noise data alone\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTotal fan noise data.\n\nAs flown, results show a net broadband noise increase of about 1dB for Fan 2, relative to Fan 1. In addition,\nexcept at approach power, total fan noise increased by over 1dB.\nTable 2-2.

Figure 2-27 shows scaled (to 130-in. diameter fan) Fan 2 minus Fan 1 BFaNS predictions for\nthe total broadband power levels at sideline power.\nThe low frequency 1/3 octave bands (50 Hz to 125\nHz) were excluded because they are normally not\nfan noise dominated. The other 1/3 octave bands\n(8kHz and 10kHz) were excluded because no\nscaled data exists at these frequencies. Fan 2 data\ndoes in fact appear to be about 1dB higher than the\nFan 1 data, which is consistent with the broadband\nFigure 2-27. Broadband Sound Power Level Deltas (Fan 2\nEPNL calculations (Table 2-3). The BFaNS predicMinus Fan 1) with 1/3 Octave Band Spectrum and Sideline\ntions also show an increase in noise on the order of\nPower\n2dB. These consistent results show that the basic\nscaling rules used in Table 2-3 do not apply to these two differently loaded fans.\nFurther examination of the BFaNS predictions finds that fan tip turbulence interaction with the FEGV was the\nmajor contributor to fan broadband noise. This noise rose in Fan 2 relative to Fan 1. Figure 2-28 shows CFD predictions at the FEGV leading edge. These predictions illustrate the circumferential and radial content of the fan turbulence. Results show the rise in turbulence for Fan 2 relative to Fan 1. The cause of this increased turbulence is\nunknown.\n\nFigure 2-28. Rotor Wake Turbulence at FEGV Leading Edge: CFD Prediction at Sideline Power\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n2-24\n\nAt approach power, a small decrease in total fan EPNL is noted (Table 2-3). This decrease appears to be mostly\nbecause the 2BPF tone emanating from Fan 2 is cutoff, while it is cuton in Fan 1. Thus, at approach power, the total\nfan EPNL delta is strictly a vane number effect.\nOne other method was also employed to evaluate these Fan 1 versus Fan 2 results. As a result of work done by\nD.C. Mathews, a simple broadband sound power level formulation was developed. This formulation used the\nknowledge of basic isolated airfoil acoustics to determine possible scaling parameters for broadband noise. The\nformulation was then applied to sideline power. The D.C. Mathews formulation equation is:\n\n[\n\nSound Power \xe2\x88\x9d 10 log C 3V02 NV\n\n]\n\nWhere:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nC = Absolute velocity into the stator (ft/sec)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nV0 = Turbulence (ft/sec)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNV = Number of FEGVs.\n\nTable 2-4 illustrates the results of this equation (given as the P&W Results) along with the results from the\nBFaNS and from data for broadband noise only. In all three cases, Fan 2 noise goes up rather than down, as conventional scaling factors might predict.\nTable 2-4.

Fan 2 was\nintended to go further with this concept. However, it was apparently too highly loaded to support a further decrease\nin tip speed.\nIn Section 2.4, a preliminary fan and FEGV design are shown, which were intended for the next build of this\nrig (that was dropped from the contract).1 The fan design in Section 2.4.1.2 uses Fan 2 as a baseline for improvements. The FEGV design in Section 2.4.2 features Fan 1 as its baseline fan and details the creation of a new design\nfrom this fan stage.\n2.3\n\nRIG AIRFLOW AND INLET SEPARATION ANALYSIS\n\nThis section describes the method used to determine the total fan airflow used in the analysis and includes\ncomparisons of measured boundary layer profiles to predictions for verifying rig airflows. In addition, it describes\nthe analysis used to determine the inlet separation angle-of-attack and shows a typical inlet distortion pattern that\nwas produced during angle-of-attack/fan surge margin distortion testing. This discussion is split up into three sections. The first section, Section 2.3.1 describes the inlet configuration and instrumentation. Section 2.3.2 describes\nthe method to determine airflow, and Section 2.3.3 covers inlet distortion and separation angle-of-attack.\n1\n\nThe next rig build was dropped from the contract.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n2-25\n\n2.3.1 Inlet Configuration and Instrumentation\nThe 22-in. rig inlet configuration (shown in Figure 2-29) used in this test was designed:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWith an inlet throat area (At) that is sized for a maximum corrected flow of 99.53 lb/s without an internal\nshock.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo have a shock free external contour.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo be separation-free up to a 27-degree angle-ofattack at a takeoff corrected airflow of 90 lb/s.\n\nFigure 2-30 shows the 22-in. rig inlet instrumentation.\nDuring rig performance testing, the inlet wall static pressures\nat Station 2 were used to obtain total fan airflow, while the\naxial static pressures and the total pressure boundary layer\nprobes/pole rakes were used to measure inlet separation and\ndistortion. The boundary layer probes were also be used to\nverify the predicted boundary layer thickness used in the airflow calculation.\n\nFigure 2-29. ADP 22-in. Rig Inlet\n\n2.3.2 Method to Determine Fan Airflow\nAirflow is determined from the method shown in Figures 2-31 and 2-32, where a code calibration process and\nmeasured wall pressure was used. To describe this in more detail, a correlation between measured static pressure\nand inviscid airflow was created in a parametric inviscid CFD study of the inlet. The airflow was then adjusted for\nviscous effects by calculating a \xe2\x88\x86 CD correlation through the use of a standalone strip integral boundary-layer code.\nThe information from these two calculations was combined to create a correlation between measured Station 2\nstatic pressure and corrected airflow\n\nWall Static Pressure at Station 2.0/\nTunnel Total Pressure\n\n.\n\n1.0\n0.9\n\nData\nIncreasing\nAirflow\n\n0.8\n\nFan Leading\nEdge\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n\nAirflow Measurement Plane\nSubsonic\nSupersonic\n\n0.4\nAxial Station\n134178.cdr\n\nFigure 2-31.

The calculation was then compared to measured data. This comparison can be seen in\nFigure 2-33 where predicted total pressure profile (lines) for two airflows (80.54 lb/sec and 57.7 lb/sec) are compared to data (symbols). Except near the edge of the profile, the prediction agrees well with the data.\n\nDistance from Surface \xe2\x80\x94\n\nR in.\n\n2.3.3 Inlet Distortion and Separation Angle of Attack\nThe inlet separation angle was determined by monitoring\n0.6\nPrediction WC = 80.54 lb/s\nthe static and total pressure instrumentation on the model.\nPrediction WC = 57.7 lb/s\nFigure 2-34 shows how the instrumentation was used.

FAN DESIGN OPTIMIZATION STUDIES\n3.1\n\nROTOR PARAMETRIC STUDIES\nIn support of the reduced noise goals for Fan 3, parametric studies were conducted on the rotor to investigate\nthe effects of fan loading distribution on fan noise. Fan 2 was used as the baseline fan stage for this study.\nTo perform the studies, general design concepts were considered jointly by aerodynamic and acoustic designers. An aerodynamic designer proposed designs that were reviewed with an acoustic designer. The acoustic\ndesigner then predicted the noise for each design using the CFD wake and turbulence information produced by the\naerodynamicist as input to the fan noise design system outlined in Figure 2-19.\n3.1.1 Aerodynamic Configurations\nThe following aerodynamic configurations were considered for acoustic evaluation:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ADP 22-in. rig Fan 2 \xe2\x80\x93 baseline\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ID-biased fan loading \xe2\x80\x93 fan loading is biased towards the hub of the fan, i.e., the hub is doing more work to\nturn the flow. Figure 3-1 illustrates the radial pressure profile variations relative to the baseline Fan 2 profile.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 OD-biased fan loading \xe2\x80\x93 fan loading is biased towards the tip of the fan, i.e., the tip is doing more work to\nturn the flow (Figure 3-1).\n\nFigure 3-1. Radial Profile Variation\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFigure 3-2. Converging Tip Flowpath\n\nConverged fan tip \xe2\x80\x93 the original flowpath has no convergence in the tip region; this was done so that the\nfan could have variable pitch capabilities. By converging the fan tip, it was anticipated that better fan performance would result. Figure 3-2 shows the converged tip relative to the original flowpath.\nForward swept fan \xe2\x80\x93 the effect on wakes was investigated when the fan was swept forward. This fan\nneeded to be run at a different operating point (e.g., flow and pressure ratio) than the other cases because of\nthe sensitivity of this preliminary design. Figure 3-3 illustrates the forward sweep and Figure 3-4 shows\nthe swept fan operating line change.\n\nFigure 3-4. Forward Swept Fan Operating Line\n\nFigure 3-3. Forward Swept Fan\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n3-1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIncreased tip chord \xe2\x80\x93 an increased tip chord configuration as shown in Figure 3-5 was also considered.\nThis case was not run for acoustics because there was so little change in the fan wake/turbulence quantities\npredicted by the CFD code.\n\nFigure 3-5. Increased Tip Chord Distribution and Loading Parameter\nThe output of the 3-D Navier-Stokes studies of the selected rotor configurations is predicted circumferentially-averaged turbulence and wakes. Figure 3-6 shows the predicted turbulence for the various rotor configurations. Figure 3-7 shows an expanded scale for the duct tip region.\n\nFigure 3-7. Predicted Circumferentially-Averaged\nTurbulence \xe2\x80\x93 Tip Region\n\nFigure 3-6. Predicted Circumferentially-Averaged\nTurbulence\n\nPredicted wakes for the baseline (Fan 2) and ID- and OD-biased configurations are illustrated in Figure 3-8;\npredicted wakes for the other configurations are depicted in Figure 3-9.\n\nFigure 3-8. Predicted Fan Wakes for Base Fan 3 and\nID and OD Configurations\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\nFigure 3-9. Predicted Fan Wakes for All Other\nConfigurations\n\n3-2\n\nIn conclusion, Figures 3-6 and 3-7 show that turbulent kinetic energy for all configurations is similar out to the\n85 percent span location. In the tip region, Figure 3-7 shows that only the swept fan profile and the converging tip\nprofile differ from the others, with the swept fan showing the lowest profile.\nFigures 3-8 and 3-9 show general similarity for the wake profiles at the 95 percent span location.\nThe effect on acoustics for the turbulence and wake profiles illustrated previously is discussed in the next section.\n3.1.2\n\nAcoustic Studies\n\nSection 3.1.1 discusses the configurations considered by the aerodynamic/acoustic team. For this design study,\nonly the sideline operating condition was considered (756 ft/sec for Fan 2; see Table 2-1). Tone noise predictions\nwere made by coupling the rotor and stator, with a rotor wake/stator interaction noise source as the driver\n(Figure 2-20). All broadband noise sources were predicted according to Figure 2-21. Delta power levels from the\nbaseline Fan 2 design were determined and added to Fan 2 farfield acoustic data. EPNL predictions were then performed using the engine/aircraft configuration outlined in the beginning of Section 2.3.3.\nTable 3-1 shows the tone noise deltas (relative to Fan 2 noise levels) for each tone, inlet, and aft. In this configuration, there are 18 blades, and 51 vanes making BPF cutoff. Results show that the best configuration for tones is\nfor an ID-biased fan. However, the OD-biased fan also shows noise reductions.\nTable 3-1.

The forward swept fan was likely impacted by the subsonic nature of this fan\xe2\x80\x99s tip\nspeeds, combined with the preliminary design issues associated with the fan.\nThe reason for the fan tone noise reductions with the ID-biased fan appears to relate to the interaction of the\nrotor wake phasing with the FEGV. This interaction is seen in Figure 3-10, which shows the upwash velocities for\nthe two fans (i.e., the flow variation through the wake, perpendicular to the mean absolute velocity into the\nFEGVs). Since the FEGV leading edge is a radial line from the rig centerline, more of the wake is radial and slapping the FEGV with the baseline Fan 2 than with the ID-biased loaded fan. This effect appears to be important to\nthe noise; it causes a noise reduction for the ID-biased loaded fan. Also in Figure 3-10, the wakes appear to not be\nsmooth. This results from how the wakes are interpolated by the plotting routine used for this visualization and\ndoes not impact the noise source.\nIn further analysis, it appears that the wake harmonic magnitudes at the FEGV leading edge do not vary much.\nFigure 3-11 illustrates this point by showing the ID-biased wake harmonic magnitudes of 20 log (wake harmonic\nmagnitude) versus those of the baseline Fan 2 calculation. Based on noise theory, the 20-log calculation denotes\nnoise differences at the various harmonics. There is little difference between the two fans for 2BPF and 3BPF, indicating that the wake phase interaction with the stator geometry explains the great majority of the difference\nbetween the two fan tone noise levels. Similar results are found for the other fans.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n3-3\n\nFigure 3-10. Wake CFD Predictions Near FEGV (Upwash Velocity [ft/sec])\n\nFigure 3-11. Fourier Decomposition of CFD Wake Upwash (20 Log [Wake Harmonic Magnitude])\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n3-4\n\nThus, the following conclusions are made about the tone noise predictions for these various fan designs:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The ID-biased loaded rotor is the quietest\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wake harmonic magnitudes are similar for the different rotors\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Predicted tone noise changes appear to be largely due to rotor wake phase lag.\nFigure 3-12 shows the broadband noise deltas (relative to the Fan 2 noise levels) for the ADP rig, scaled to a\n130-in. diameter fan, inlet, and aft. Broadband levels are given on a narrowband basis. Results are color coded in\norder from highest to lowest noise levels:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Converged tip is red\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Forward swept is blue\n\xe2\x80\xa2 OD biased is orange\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ID-biased is green.\nResults show very modest noise reductions for the ID-biased fan and near zero noise reductions for the ODbiased fan. Other fans show a noise increase.\n\nFigure 3-12. Fan Broadband Predicted Deltas Scaled to 130-in. Diameter Fan\n(Delta Power Levels Relative to Baseline Fan 2 and CFD Turbulence Used as Input)\nOverall, fan tip turbulence interaction with the stator is\npredicted to be the most important noise source for these\nfans. To investigate these results somewhat further, the predicted circumferentially-averaged turbulence intensities at\nthe FEGV leading edge are shown for all fans in\nFigure 3-13. These turbulence intensities, in part, determine the noise levels for the fan wake turbulence/stator\ninteraction noise (for midspan turbulence), fan tip turbulence/stator interaction (tip turbulence), and fan hub turbulence/stator interaction (hub turbulence). There is little\ndifference in the turbulence levels at the center of the\nFEGV. At the hub and the tip, there are some differences\npredicted by the CFD code. However, these differences are\nmainly confined to the converged tip and forward swept fan\nconfigurations. This explains the small changes seen in the\nOD-biased and ID-biased broadband noise levels relative to\nthe baseline fan. Thus, broadband noise predictions show\nthe following characteristics:\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n3-5\n\nFigure 3-13. CFD Predicted CircumferentiallyAveraged Turbulence (ft/sec) Near FEGV Leading\nEdge\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe ID-biased loaded rotor is the quietest\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTurbulence levels are similar for all fans\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFan tip turbulence/stator interaction dominates at most frequencies\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInlet boundary layer turbulence/rotor interaction dominates at very high frequencies.\n\nTo best understand these results, the tone- and broadband-predicted deltas (relative to Fan 2 predictions) are\nadded to the Fan 1 and Fan 2 data and flown in the 130-in. diameter fan configuration engine at flight conditions.\nFor the purposes of simplicity, only the results from the ID-biased fan, the best fan configuration, are shown in the\nform of deltas from the baseline ADP 22-in. fan rig configurations (Table 3-2).\nEPNL predictions were completed using three different methods:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAdjust for tones \xe2\x80\x93 database adjusted for tone deltas only (no broadband deltas added)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAdjust for broadband minus 0.3 dB \xe2\x80\x93 database is adjusted down 0.3 dB for broadband noise only. This is\nthe average noise reduction found in Figure 3-12\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAdjust for tones and broadband \xe2\x80\x93 full EPNL prediction, including both tone and broadband noise.\n\nResults of these EPNL predictions are shown in Table 3-2. By adjusting for tones and broadband separately,\nthe impact of each of these noise components on the total EPNL reduction is investigated. Also, predictions are\nshown using two different baseline configurations, Fans 1 and 2. This provides information on the impact of using\neither fan stage as a baseline, even though tone and broadband deltas are all relative to Fan 2.\nAs can be seen, the EPNL noise reductions observed are mainly due to the predicted reductions in fan tone\nnoise. Broadband noise reductions were minimal.\nTable 3-2.

After presentation to NASA management and joint review of these results, agreement was reached to continue work on optimizing FEGV stator\ndesigns with the rotor design of Fan 1.\nTo perform the studies, general design concepts were considered by aerodynamic and acoustic designers.\nBased on these discussions, aerodynamic designers developed designs. Acoustic designers discussed the designs\nwith aerodynamic designers and predicted the noise for each design using the fan noise design system outlined in a\nprocess, which will be discussed below. Fan 1 was used as the baseline fan stage for this study.\nTable 3-3.

The configurations outlined below use the same numbering system as in Table 3-3. Figures 3-14 and 3-15 illustrate the general vane geometries that were predicted. The configurations are:\n1) ADP 22-in.Fan 1 rig FEGV \xe2\x80\x93 Baseline.\n2) Vane number study with constant FEGV solidity \xe2\x80\x93 These studies assumed the vane solidity (chord/pitch\nratio) remained constant as the vane number changed. This assumption was used for all vane number studies of the configurations below.\n3) Solidity (chord change) \xe2\x80\x93 This configuration involved adding 20 percent to the FEGV aerodynamic chord\nin preparation for sweep/lean/bow studies that may require the additional stiffness. This relatively modest\nchord change was not considered acoustically significant; thus, it was not predicted.\n4-6) Stacking line variations \xe2\x80\x93 These variations included adding 30 degree axial sweep to the FEGV, adding\nbow/lean to the vane, and adding both sweep and bow/lean to the vane.\n5) (See Figure 3-14 where PS = pressure side of the airfoil, SS = suction side of the airfoil).\n6) Baseline Fan 1 radial vanes in forward position with simulated tip boot \xe2\x80\x93 Shown in Figure 3-15, this\ngeometry approximation was intended to determine the effect on noise of forward sweeping the vane tip\nregion by 45 degrees. This configuration was considered because of the predicted importance of the fan tip\nturbulence/FEGV interaction broadband noise source.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n3-7\n\nFigure 3-14. FEGV Geometry Considered\n\nFigure 3-15. Tip Boot Geometry\nAll calculations were performed with the FEGV leading edge in the existing forward FEGV position on the rig\n(Figure 2-22).\nFor this design study, sideline, cutback, and approach, operating conditions were considered (see Table 2-1).\nTo perform FEGV acoustic studies, the fan noise design system was modified somewhat from that shown in\nFigure 2-19. Instead, the design system shown in Figure 3-16 was used. This system eliminates the running of the\nBFaNS and replaces it with the calculation of two empirical deltas:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n30 log [cos(vane sweep angle)] \xe2\x80\x93 comes from Allison swept vane testing (Reference 12) and first order\nmodeling.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n7 log (vane number) \xe2\x80\x93 comes from Boeing rig testing and the BFaNS predictions.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n3-8\n\nTones\n(TFaNS)\n\nInput Files\n\nBroadband\n\nSOURCE3D\nInput File\nModified to\nAWAKEN\n\nRotor and Stator\nGeometry;\nStreamline\nCode\nPerformance\n\nBaseline Broadband Spectra\n\nAWAKEN\n\nCFD Code Output\nFEGV Leading Edge\n\nSOURCE3D\n\nFrom Boeing/Allison Tests,\n1st Order Modeling, and\nBFaNS Running\n\n30 log [cos (Vane Sweep Angle)]\n7 log (Vane Number)\n\nCUP3D\nTone Power Levels\n30 log [cos(Vane Sweep Angle)]\nTone Power Levels\n\nPredicted Broadband Spectra\n\nD PWLs Relative to FAN 1\n\nD PWLs Relative to FAN 1\n134205.cdr\n\nFigure 3-16. Noise Design System for FEGV Study\n\nThis modification permitted FEGV geometry to be analyzed for a wide range of vane numbers, thus allowing\nfor more effective stator design. Tone noise was predicted using the same process that was used for the rotor design\nstudies. The rotor and stator were coupled using a rotor wake/stator interaction noise source as the driver\n(Figure 2-20). Delta power levels from the baseline Fan 1 design were determined and added to Fan 1 data. EPNL\npredictions were then performed using the engine/aircraft configuration outlined in the beginning of Section 2.3.3.\nCumulative EPNLs (sums of the three operating conditions) were calculated and compared to the baseline. Delta\nEPNLs were then created relative to the baseline Fan 1 design.\nTo predict BPF noise when it was cuton, inlet and aft BPF tone SPL directivity shapes from an existing fullscale engine were used for multiple low speeds. Sound power levels were also calculated for this full-scale engine\nfor each speed. Measured normalized inlet and aft BPF SPL directivities were then calculated using the equation:\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n( )\n\nSPLNORM \xce\xb8 , N1C = SPL \xce\xb8 , N1C \xe2\x88\x92 PWL N1C\n\nwhere:\nSPLNORM = Normalized BPF sound pressure level, inlet and aft (dB)\nSPL = Full-Scale BPF sound pressure level, inlet and aft (dB)\nPWL = Full-Scale BPF sound power level, inlet and aft (dB)\nN1c = Function of corrected rotational speed\n\xce\xb8 = function of farfield directivity angle.\nNormalized BPF SPL directivity shapes, inlet and aft, were then combined and curve fitted. ADP 22-in. rig\ninlet and aft BPF SPL directivities were predicted by adding normalized directivities (from above) to the TFaNS\npredicted inlet and aft BPF power levels. The remainder of the system explained above was then used to calculate\nfan tone deltas and EPNLs.\nThe tip boot configuration predictions were made by using tone levels from the straight vane configuration.\nBroadband noise was then calculated by assuming that the fan tip turbulence/stator interaction noise source dominated. Thus, using 30 log [cos(sweep)] where sweep equals 45 degrees, we expect a 4.5 dB noise reduction.\nAssuming all other broadband noise sources are down about 10 dB, the noise reduction totals about 4.0 dB. This\ndelta was applied to the broadband database before the result was flown.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n3-9\n\nFigure 3-17. CFD-Predicted Upwash Velocities with Cutback Power at the Straight Stator\nLeading Edge for ADP Fan Rig 1\nFigure 3-17 was used for the development of bow/lean designs. This figure shows the CFD predicted upwash\nvelocities (i.e., the velocities perpendicular to the average mean flow) at the baseline straight stator leading edge\nwith cutback power. Assuming a zero incidence on a cascade of flat plate stators, these velocities indicate the type\nof unsteadiness encountered by the stator. The non-smooth shapes in the plot are a function of how the plotting routine interpolates the velocities from one grid point to the next. The direction of rotor rotation is noted as counterclockwise.\nFigure 3-17 is useful in determining the phase of the wake across the span of the FEGVs. Potential vane leading edges were compared with this figure, including the present straight vane, leaned vane, and bowed vane possibilities. In Figure 3-17, the three most promising configurations are considered a straight vane (the baseline), a\nleaned vane, and a bowed vane. If the FEGV and the wake are in line with each other, wake slapping occurs. This\ntends to cause high noise levels because the phase lag from radius to radius is zero. On the other hand, a vane that\nsweeps smoothly through the wake produces different radial phases and, usually, low tone noise. Each vane set\nconsidered was assessed qualitatively for the smallest amount of wake slapping.\nThe straight vane shows some phase lag from the midspan to the tip and near the hub. However, there is a section of the vane at about 30 percent span where the wakes slap the vanes. This is hypothesized to cause higher tone\nnoise in this region that could be lowered. The leaned vane shows improved phasing from the midspan to the tip,\nbut also suffers from vane slapping at about 30 percent span to the hub. The bowed vane shows no vane slapping\nanywhere across the vane. Thus, this bowed vane design was one of the design concepts considered in addition to\nthe straight (baseline vane).\nVane sweep has been found to have a powerful effect on fan noise (Reference 12). This effect impacts both\nbroadband and tones from the point of view of reducing the effective Mach number going into the stator. It also can\nlower noise by reducing the impact of vane slapping, as described in the bow/lean discussion, by changing the distance the wake must travel from hub to tip. Reference 12 found that at least 30 degrees of sweep is desirable to\nreduce noise. Thus, this concept was used as another method for reducing noise.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n3-10\n\nFigure 3-18. Cumulative Delta EPNL (APP+C/B+S/L): Straight Versus Bowed Versus Swept Vanes\nThe evaluation of the various vane geometries will now be discussed in the form of cumulative delta EPNLs\nrelative to the Fan 1 baseline configuration. Figure 3-18 shows cumulative delta EPNL predictions for the baseline, bowed, and swept vane geometries for vane numbers ranging from 11 to 79 vanes. The baseline Fan 1 rig has\n18 fan blades and 45 FEGVs. The baseline FEGV prediction point is denoted by the red dot on the figure. At the\nbottom of Figure 3-18, cuton vane number ranges are shown that correspond to BPF, 2BPF and 3BPF, from APP\nto sideline S/L powers. The specified harmonic remains cuton below these vane number ranges. The thick horizontal black line denotes no change from the baseline engine; below that line is a noise decrease and above that line is\na noise increase.\nA number of observations can be made about Figure 3-18:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe swept vanes produce the most noise reduction.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThis is, in part, due to the 30 log [cos(vane sweep angle)] used in the calculation of tones and broadband\nwhich, by itself, accounts for a 1.9 dB noise reduction at each operating condition. The maximum noise\nreductions are found for cuton vane numbers and are shown as thick blue lines.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAt high vane numbers, the noise goes up with increasing vane number linearly or near linearly. This is due\nto the 7 log (vane number) in the broadband noise model.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOnce 2BPF begins to cuton, then the effects of the tones become more noticeable.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVarying vane number using the baseline vane geometry provides limited noise reductions. These are\nshown as thick blue lines on the baseline vanes curve. Noise reductions amount to less than three-quarters\nof a cumulative EPNL, relative to the baseline.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe bowed vanes result in more noise reduction. This type of vane is best for cuton vane numbers. The low\nnoise vane numbers are outlined along the bowed vane line as thick blue lines.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe vane numbers where the most noise reduction can be obtained seem to surround the fan blade number\n(i.e., vane numbers of around 15 to 19).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNoise reductions can also be made for vane numbers around twice the number of fan blades (i.e., 35 to 39\nvanes)\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n3-11\n\nFigure 3-19. Cumulative Delta EPNL (APP+C/B+S/L): Straight Versus Swept Versus Swept/Bowed Vanes\nResults for the baseline vanes, swept vanes (the best configuration in Figure 3-18), and the swept and bowed\nvanes are shown in Figure 3-19. This figure is configured in much the same fashion as Figure 3-18. The following\nresults can be stated from Figure 3-19:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe swept/bowed vane configuration shows the most noise reduction of all the cases shown so far.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBy sweeping and bowing the vanes, the design system essentially shows a 7 log (vane number) trend above\napproximately 37 to 39 vanes, which is consistent with the broadband noise prediction. Below this point,\ntone noise enters the total noise results.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMaximum noise reduction potential appears to be a little above the 18 fan blade number (approximately 21\nto 25 vanes) with a secondary minimum at 35 to 41 vanes.\n\nIt should be noted that for Figures 3-18 and 3-19, these noise reductions can be quite significant. The noise\nreductions are predicated on certain tone noise reductions based on rotor wake/stator interaction noise only. Broadband noise also follows certain assumptions regarding the importance of rotor turbulence/FEGV interaction noise\nsources relative to only fan noise sources. These assumptions may overpredict the overall noise reduction potential,\nthough the trends appear reasonable. There appears to be some significant noise benefit possible with a swept/\nbowed FEGV.\nThe last vane configuration to be discussed is the tip boot. This is essentially the baseline vane with a modification in the tip region that reduces fan tip turbulence/FEGV interaction noise. Thus, this noise source is assumed to\nbe dominant (which it appears to be in this rig). Figure 3-20 shows this configuration along with the baseline configuration and the swept/bowed vane configuration. As before, maximum noise reduction vane numbers are shown\nas thick blue lines on this chart for each configuration.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n3-12\n\nFigure 3-20. Cumulative Delta EPNL (APP+C/B+S/L): Straight Versus Swept Versus Swept/Bowed Vanes\nObservations from Figure 3-20 include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBoth the swept/bowed vane and the tip boot appear to maximize the fan stages\xe2\x80\x99 noise reduction potential,\ngiven the optimum vane numbers for each configuration.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe tip boot only works on broadband dominated vane numbers, assuming fan tip turbulence/FEGV interaction is the noisiest broadband noise source. Thus, it is optimum at the higher vane numbers (approximately 53 to 61 vanes). The swept/bowed configuration works best when tones contribute, and makes vane\nnumbers on the order of 21 to 25 vanes the quietest.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe contribution of 3BPF is seen more clearly for the tip boot configuration, since broadband noise has\nbeen dropped an additional 4dB per operating condition due to the tip boots.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTip boots do lower noise at lower vane numbers, just not as effectively as sweep and bow or lean, since\ntone noise dominates at lower vane numbers.\n\nTable 3-4 summarizes the potential noise reduction that can be obtained from the FEGV geometries studied.\nThe optimum vane numbers for each configuration are also given based on Figure 3-18, Figure 3-19, and\nFigure 3-20. The noise reductions quoted are based on the assumptions made about the noise. Thus, it is likely that\nsome of the noise reduction will be lost due to other noise sources. However, significant noise reduction potential\ndoes exist with properly designed FEGVs.\n\nTable 3-4.

This back-to-back nacelle stiffness check was conducted to verify that acceptable fan blade tip clearances would exist under test facility loads.\nThe existing finite element model of the 22-in. fan/nacelle test rig provided the baseline configuration. The\nnew FEGV configuration was developed from an airfoil shape representing the bowed/swept configuration and\nincorporated into the model. Back-to-back finite element stiffness checks were performed for both rig configurations. Stiffness results were tabulated.\n3.3.1 Finite Element Results\nThe original ANSYS models obtained by archival retrieval were converted into MSC/NASTRAN V68 files.\nThe translator used was FEMAP V5.0. All analyses were performed using MSC/NASTRAN V68.\nThe models were constrained at the FEGV I.D. rear. A unit load of 1,000 lbf was applied in the nacelle at the\nfan tip location for each coordinate direction. This would allow for stiffness comparison of the original and bowed/\nswept configurations. Geometry and material definition was copied for the 22-vane model. In each FEGV model,\nthe FEGVs were modeled with steel properties. Deflection results were recorded and are organized in Table 3-5.\nNomenclature\nThe cylindrical coordinate system was used:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nx \xe2\x80\x93 a direction radially from the rig centerline\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xce\xb8 \xe2\x80\x93 a direction tangential to the radial direction and perpendicular to the rig centerline\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nz \xe2\x80\x93 a direction along the rig centerline.\nTable 3-5.

The results indicate the new configuration would be suitable for operation in the rig.

CONCLUSIONS\nThis task was originally authorized to design and build the third (Fan 3) in a series of 22-in. diameter tip fan\nrigs for testing at NASA GRC. The design of Fan 3 was intended to incorporate experience gained from Fans 1 and\n2 and demonstrate noise reduction technology that would surpass accepted 1992 levels by 6 dB.\nMidway through the program, NASA decided to cancel the design, fabrication, and testing phases of the work.\nThe scope of the program changed accordingly to concentrate on two subtasks:\n1. Rig data analysis and CFD code validation\n2. Fan and FEGV optimization studies.\n4.1\n\nCFD AND FAN NOISE DESIGN SYSTEM VALIDATION CONCLUSIONS\n\nA noise prediction system is in place and integrated with CFD. The CFD tool predictability has been assessed\nto gain understanding of fan noise sources, such as wakes and turbulence. The resulting tool predicts well 3-D\nflowfield features from the blade trailing edge to about a chord downstream. However, the CFD tool loses accuracy\nas the distance from the trailing edge increases beyond a blade chord. The comparisons of CFD predictions to data\nhinge on several assumptions. These assumptions encompass any modeled geometric discrepancies with actual\ngeometry, modeled inlet turbulence profiles, modeled turbulence transition, and modeled fan/core flow split with\ntest.\nThe comparisons of noise predictions to rig test data showed that both the TFaNS and the BFaNS demonstrated\nreasonable agreement with the data to the degree that these tools can reliably be used for design work.\n4.1.1 Rig Data Analysis\nFan 1 and 2 test data were analyzed for noise differences. This analysis found that the expected 2 dB noise\nreduction for Fan 2 was not realized. The scaling rules used for this prediction were:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe standard 50 log (tip speed) scaling factor for the reduced tip speed of Fan 2, which indicated a reduction of 2.5 dB\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe empirical 7 log (vane number) scaling factor from Boeing rig testing for broadband noise, which predicted a 0.4 dB increase.\n\nThe result was a net 2 dB BFaNS reduction. When using the BFaNS to evaluate Fan 2, the results confirm a\nnoise increase on the order of 2 dB. The results show that the scaling rules initially used do not apply to the different aerodynamic loading of these two fans.\nThe section on rig airflow and inlet separation analysis describes the method used to determine total fan airflow and shows the good agreement of predicted boundary layer profiles to measured profiles. The results of the\ninlet flow separation studies show separation angles-of-attack ranging from 29.5 degrees to 27 degrees for the\nrange of airflows tested.\n4.1.2 Fan Optimization Studies\nFive aerodynamic rotor configurations were included in a parametric study to investigate the effects of fan\nloading distribution on fan noise. The results of the studies were significant in leading to the decision not to pursue\na new rotor design for Fan 3. Noise predictions for a 750 ft/sec Fan 3 rotor showed little reduction in comparison to\nFan 2, and resulted in the recommendation to concentrate efforts on FEGV stator designs.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n4-1\n\n4.1.3 FEGV Optimization Studies\nThe parametric study on FEGV designs included variations on\n1. Vane numbers\n2. Solidity (chord change)\n3. Stacking line variations including sweep, bow, and lean\n4. Vane tip boots.\nThe study results showed the potential for 8 to 10 EPNdB noise reduction relative to the baseline, with the configuration featuring 22 bowed vanes, each with 30 degrees of sweep, showing the greatest potential.\nA preliminary rig nacelle structural analysis was performed on the 22-vane configuration that is bowed with 30\ndegrees of sweep relative to the 52-vane configuration of Fan 1. The results showed the 22-vane configuration to\nbe significantly stiffer than the original in the torsional and axial directions and only slightly stiffer in the transverse direction. Stress results were not determined, since this part of the program was cancelled.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942004-212718\n\n4-2\n\n5. REFERENCES\n1.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)\n\nThis report presents results of the work completed on the preliminary design of Fan 3 of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s 22-inch Fan Low Noise Research\nproject. Fan 3 was intended to build on the experience gained from Fans 1 and 2 by demonstrating noise reduction technology that\nsurpasses 1992 levels by 6 dB. The work was performed as part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) program. Work on\nthis task was conducted in the areas of CFD code validation, acoustic prediction and validation, rotor parametric studies, and fan exit\nguide vane (FEGV) studies up to the time when a NASA decision was made to cancel the design, fabrication and testing phases of the\nwork. The scope of the program changed accordingly to concentrate on two subtasks: (1) Rig data analysis and CFD code validation\nand (2) Fan and FEGV optimization studies. The results of the CFD code validation work showed that this tool predicts 3D flowfield\nfeatures well from the blade trailing edge to about a chord downstream. The CFD tool loses accuracy as the distance from the trailing\nedge increases beyond a blade chord. The comparisons of noise predictions to rig test data showed that both the tone noise tool and the\nbroadband noise tool demonstrated reasonable agreement with the data to the degree that these tools can reliably be used for design\nwork. The section on rig airflow and inlet separation analysis describes the method used to determine total fan airflow, shows the good\nagreement of predicted boundary layer profiles to measured profiles, and shows separation angles of attack ranging from 29.5 to 27\xe2\x88\x9e for\nthe range of airflows tested. The results of the rotor parametric studies were significant in leading to the decision not to pursue a new\nrotor design for Fan 3 and resulted in recommendations to concentrate efforts on FEGV stator designs. The ensuing parametric study on\nFEGV designs showed the potential for 8 to 10 EPNdB noise reduction relative to the baseline.\n14. SUBJECT TERMS\n\n15.
