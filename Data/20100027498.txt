b'National\nAeronautics and\nSpace\nAdministration\n\nTechBrie s\n\nAbout the NASA\nTechnology Utilization Program\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 , which established NASA\nand the United States civilian space program , requires that " The Administration shall provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of\ninformation concerning its activities and the results thereof. "\nTo help carry out this objective the NASA Technology Utilization (TU)\nProgram was establ ished in 1962. It offers a variety of valuable services to\nfacilitate the transfer of aerospace technology to nonaerospace applications,\nthus assuring American taxpayers maximum return on their investment in\nspace research ; thousands of spinoffs of NASA research have already\noccurred in virtually every area of our economy.\nThe TU Program has worked for engineers , scientists , technicians , and\nbusinessmen . And it can work for you .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs\n\nTech Briefs is published quarterly and is free to any U.S. citizen or organization . It is both a current-awareness medium and a problem-solving tool .\nPotential products ... industrial processes ... basic and applied research . ..\nshop and lab techniques .. . computer software ... new sources of technical\ndata . .. concepts . .. you will find them all in NASA Tech Briefs. The first section\nhighlights a few of the potential new products contained in Tech Briefs. The\nremainder of the volume is organized by technical category to help you quickly\nreview new developments in your areas of interest. Finally, a subject index\nmakes each issue a convenient permanent reference file .\n\nFurther Information\non Innovations\n\nAlthough many articles are complete in themselves, others are backed up by\nTechnical Support Packages (TSP\'s). TSP\'s are available without charge and\nmay be ordered by simply completing the enclosed TSP Request Card. Further\ninformation on some innovations is available for a nominal fee from other\nsources, as indicated at the ends of the articles. In addition , Technology\nUtilization Officers at NASA Field Centers will assist you directly when\nnecessary. (See page A4.)\n\nPatent Licenses\n\nMany of the inventions described are under consideration for patents or have\nbeen patented by NASA. Unless NASA has decided not to apply for a patent,\nthe patent status is described at the end of each article . For further information\nabout the Patent Program see page A8.\n\nOther Technology\nUtilization Services\n\nTo assist engineers , industrial researchers, business executives , city\nofficials , and other potential users in applying space technology to their\nproblems , NASA sponsors six Industrial Applications Centers . Their services\nare described on page A6 . In addition , an extensive library of computer\nprograms is available through COSMIC , the Technology Utilization Program \'s\noutlet for NASA-developed software . (See page A5 .)\n\nApplications Program\n\nTo help solve public-sector problems in such areas as safety, health,\ntransportation, and environmental protection, NASA TU Applications Teams,\nstaffed by professionals from a variety of disciplines , work with Federal\nagencies , local governments , and health organizations to identify critical\nproblems amenable to technical solutions . Among their many significant\ncontributions are a rechargeable heart pacemaker , a lightweight fireman \'s\nbreathing apparatus , aids for the handicapped , and safer highways .\n\nReader Feedback\n\nWe hope you find the information in NASA Tech Briefs useful. A reader\nfeedback card has been included because we want your comments and\nsuggestions on how we can further help you apply NASA innovations and\ntechnology to your needs . Please use it , or if you need more space, write us a\nletter.\n\nNI\\SI\\Tech Briefs-\n\nWINTER 1977\nVolume 2, Number 4\n\nNational\nAeronautics and\nSpace\nAdministration\n\nNASA TU Services\n\nA3\n\nTechnology Utilization services that can\nassist you in learning about and applying\nNASA technology.\n\nNew Product Ideas\n\nA9\n\nA summary of selected innovations of\nvalue to manufacturers for the development of new products.\n\nTech Briefs\n\n427\n\nElectronic Components\nand Circuits\n\n449\n\nElectronic Systems\n\n459\n\nPhysical Sciences\n\n479\n\nMaterials\n\n495\n\nLife Sciences\n\n501\n\nMechanics\n\n523\n\nMachinery\n\n531\n\nFabrication Technology\n\n551\n\nMathematics and\nInformation Sciences\n\n559\n\nItems in this issue are-Indexed by subject;\na cumulative index will be published yearly.\n\nSubject Index\n\no\n\nCOVERS: The photographs on tha front and back covers Illustrate commercial and nonaerospace advances made with the\ness/stance of NASA\'s Technology Utilize/ion program and from new technology developed by NASA end Its contractors .

Each is\ndiscussed further on the referenced page in the appropriate section in this issue. If\nyou are interested in developing a product from these or other NASA innovations,\nyou can receive further technical information by requesting the TSP referenced at\nthe end of the full-length article or by writing the Technology Utilization Office of\nthe sponsoring NASA center (see page A4) . NASA\'s patent-licensing program to\nencourage commercial development is described on page A8.\n\nNew Process Produces\nHigh-Power Schottky Diodes\n\n(such as the output of many optical\ntransmitters), \'is the heart of the\ncoupler. The stationary image is\npicked up by detectors at the\nreceiving end of the system . The\ninterface is bidi rectional so that the\nroles of object and image can be\nreversed.\n(See page 468.)\n\nA new high-yield process produces mesa-geometry Schottky\ndiodes with high reverse breakdown\nvoltage and low reverse leakage\ncurrent. The diodes can carry\ncurrents up to 50 amperes with less\nthan 0.7-volt forward voltage drop.\n\nMiniature Diaphragm Valve\nfor Medical Equipment\n\nCOIL ASSEMBLY\n\nPIN\n\nSwitching times are typically less\nthan 50 nanoseconds. The new\nprocess involves forming a Schottky\nbarrier by depositing a film of\nplatinum on epitaxially-grown silicon\nwafers while they are help at an\nelevated temperature . The platinum\nreacts with the silicon to form\nplatinum silicide over the entire\nmesa top right up to the surrounding\nsilicon oxide boundary. This metalization prevents edge breakdown\nand minimizes surface leakage.\n(See page 431.)\n\nNe>Splll Touchup Paint\nContainer\nSmall paint cans used for touchup\npainting can be converted to "spillproof" containers with a new threaded spout that is installed in a hole in\na standard paint-can lid. The spout\nhas a funnel that makes it easier to\ndip the brush and a central tubular\npart that extends almost to the\nbottom of the container. If the can\n\nAl0\n\ntips, the seal between the spout and\nthe lid prevents spillage. The device\nis simple and can be made is most\nshops .\n(See page 529.)\n\nRotating Optical Coupler for\nSignal Transmission\n\nData can be transmitted across a\nrotating interface without sliprings or\nother mechanical contacts using a\nnew optical coupler able to handle\nsimultaneously many high bit-rate\nsignal channels. This coupler could\nbe incorporated into several types of\noptical-communications and datatransfer equipment. A rotating Dove\nprism assembly, which forms a\nstationary image of a rotating object\n\nA proposed new valve isolates the\nmoving parts of the valve assembly\nfrom the valved fluid . This feature is\nuseful in biomedical applications\nwhere fluids that are subjected to\nsterilization temperatures might\nleave a residue that could degrade\nthe performance of the valve. The\nfluid is isolated by molding the\npoppet and diaphragm in a single\nunit that separates the plunger\nmechanism from inlet and outlet\nports . The design also gives a\npositive locking action for effective\nseating and unseating of the diaphragm .\n(See page 498.)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1977\n\n"Either-Side-Up" Inflatable\nLifera"\n\n(I)\n\nA new one-man life raft can be\nthrown into the water and boarded\nregardless of which side falls up\nwhen it lands. The "both-sides-up"\nfeature is made possible by positioning the floor midway between the\ntop and bottom of the inflatable float\ntube. The raft is symmetrical about a\nhorizontal plane through its midheight and can be ridden on either\nside. Other features include a\nzippered entry door in the floor of the\nraft that is easily fabricated and\nmakes boarding easier and a\ndouble-sectioned float tube that\nprovides an extra margin of safety\nagainst punctures .\n(See page 518.)\n\nVersatile Communications\nTerminal\n\nMany widely separated parties are\njoined in an efficient communications network by a versatile new\ncontrol terminal that handles voice\nand data transmissions via both\ntelephone lines and radio-frequency\nchannels . The system combines\ncommercially available subassemblies into an attractive package that\nis easily operated by nontechnical\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1977\n\npersonnel. Special features include\n-a telephone autooialer, three r-adio\nand three telephone channels, and a\ntelephone-to-radio "patch." A prototype is presently being used to link\nhospitals, ambulances, and specialcare centers for rapid communications in emergency medical services\noperations.\n(See page 497.)\n\nSpace-Age Cleaning Devices\nImaginative concepts in cleaning\ndevices, originally developed for\nspace applications, may find use in\nindustry, research , and medicine.\n\nminiaturization possible. The present design can accept up to eight\nanalog Signals (blood pressure,\nblood flow, respiration , or oxygen\nconsumption, for example). The\ndata are converted to digital information and relayed to an RF transmission stage. The electronics are\npackaged in three units, each only 2\nby 5 by 8 cm in size, and power is\nsupplied by two 9-volt batteries.\n(See page 500.)\n\nCryogenic Liquid-Level\nDetector\n\nIncluded in the proposals and\ndevelopments for more effective\nbrushes and air handling are: a\ntapered-bristle brush that uses flowing air and an electrostatic-charge\nneutralizer to remove tiny surface\nparticles, a cross-sweeping brush\nthat sweeps in two directions simultaneously, an aerodynamically designed brush with a low sharp-edged\ntuftholder shaped like a diverging\nnozzle, and a notched-nozzle cleaning head that directs air into twin\ncounterrotating vortexes to detach\nand entrain particles.\n(See page 544.)\n\nBiotelemetry System for\nAmbulatory Patients\nA new system for multichannel\ntransmission of EEG, EKG, and\nother biomedical information is so\ncompact that it can be carried in a\npatient\'s belt. Pulse-code modulation is used for a high-quality signal ,\nand CMOS integrated circuits make\n\nA new continuous-reading cappcitance sensor is an accurate level\ndetector for cryogenic liquids. The\ndetector has been designed for\nquick assembly, fast response, and\ngood performance even when there\nis sloshing , boiling , or other disturbance in the liquid. The sensor,\nessentially a long parallel-plate\ncapacitor with a specially-designed\ndielectric spacer, gives an accuracy\nof better than 1 percent when used\nwith any of several simple signalconditioning circuits.

Cells of p-Ga1-xAlxAs,\np-GaAs, and n-GaAs have been\nmade by a single-step process,\nwhich replaces previous methods\nthat required ,several more-involved\ngrowth sequences . In addition, the\nefficiency of the new cells is 18.5\npercent compared to the about\n15-percent efficiency that had been\nthe best achievable previously.\nThe high efficiency of GaAs solar\ncells depends on large minoritycarrier diffusion lengths (>3 ~m) in\nthe photoactive region of the cell\nplus a thin (<O . 5-~m) Ga1-xAl xAs\nlayer. The GaAs required is necessary for high current collection\nefficiency, and the thin Ga1-xAlxAs\nlayer enhances the amount of solar\nradiation absorbed in the photoactive region of the GaAs. Earlier\nliquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) techniques utilized to grow the thin\nGa1-xAl xAs layer resulted in a\ndeterioration in minority-carrier diffusion lengths in the region of the\nGaAs next to the Ga1-xAlxAs layer.\nThis lowered cell efficiency. Deterioration of the GaAs substrate could\nbe prevented by contacting the substrate with a saturated LPE melt for\na specific time followed by cooling ,\nbut the cooling leads to the growth of\na discontinuous nonuniform layer of\nGa1-xAlxAs at the thin thicknesses\ndesired.\nThe new one-step technique produces a solar cell with a uniform and\ncontinuous Ga1-xAl xAs layer thinner\nthan 0.5 ~m and produces a minority\ndiffusion length in the photoactive\nGaAs region greater than 3 ~m.

A newly-developed anodization technique produces GaAs\npn-junction solar cells that exhibit\nboth an improved response to highenergy photons and a higher opencircuit voltage.\nA conventional GaAs pn-junction\nsolar cell is made by diffusing zinc\nfrom a 5-percent-Ga, 50-percentAs, 45-percent-Zn source into an\nn-type GaAs substrate at 7000 C for\n2 minutes, yielding a pn junction\n0.3 to 0.5 /Am in depth. This structure is then fabricated into a solar\ncell by applying a Au-Ge-Ni alloy\ncontact to the n-type surface and\napplying a p-type contact by the\nevaporation of, first, chromium,\nthen aluminum. The decreasing\nspectral response with increasing\nenergy (see Curve 1 in figure) for\nthis type of cell is probably caused\nby carrier-recombination losses at\nthe surface, where Significant\nabsorption of the high-energy\nphotons occurs .\nAnodizing the cell in a HP-H?O 4\nsolution of pH around 2.0 with an\napplied voltage of 40 V for 1 minute\nliroduces a GaAsO 3 layer about 750\nA thick and a refractive index of 1.S.\nThis oxide layer reduces reflection\nlosses from the GaAs surface; in\naddition, it greatly improves the\nhigh-energy response (Curve 2 in\nfigure) and increases the\nopen-ci rcuit voltage by about 15\npercent.\n\n430\n\n7\n\nw6\n\n(/)\n\nz\n\no\n\n~ 5\nw\n\nII:\n..J\n\nC2\n\n-- -CURVE\n\n4\n\nlt)\n\nW\n\n~ 3\nw\n\n3\n\n................\n\ni=\n\n:5\n\nw\n\n-- --........\n\n>\n\n2\n\nII:\n\n1 .5\n\n1 .6\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n2.2\n2.4\nPHOTON ENERGY, eV\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3.0\n\nThe Spectral Responses of three types of GaAs pn-junction solar cells\nshow the effects of surface anodization and suggest the significance of\ncarrier-recombination losses at the cell surface. Curve 1 refers to a conventional cell. The upper curve, Curve 2, is obtained after anodizing the\ncell as explained in the text. The anodlzation forms an antireflection\nlayer and probably eliminates a surface layer of GaAs with high carrierrecombination rates. This conclusion Is supported by Curve 3, the\nresponse after the anodization layer is removed. The removal of the\nantireflection coating reduces the response, compared to Curve 2, but\nthe removal of a GaAs layer during the preceding anodization results in a\nresponse that is still higher than for the conventional cell in Curve 1.\nCurve 3 shows the spectral\nresponse of the cell after the\nanodized layer has been removed by\nHCI , suggesting that anodization\neliminates a GaAs layer with high\nca rrier -recombination rates.\nThis single operation, which\nreduces reflection losses, improves\nhigh-energy response and increases\n\nopen-circuit voltage, produces highefficiency GaAs solar cells without\nthe use of heterojunction structures\nsuch as Ga1-xAlxAs/GaAs.\nThis work was done by H.

Processing procedures\nwere demonstrated, using lowtemperature platinum silicide to\nform the silicon/metal Schottky\ninterface. Over 50 power Schottky\ndiodes with forward and reverse\ncharacteristics that approach\ntheoretical values have been built\nand tested .\nSchottky diodes made by the new\nprocess have been operated with\nreverse breakdown voltages as high\nas 150 volts and leakage currents\nless than q milliamperes at 21 \'Z\' F\n(373 K). The diodes are rated to\ncarry currents up to 50 amperes with\na forward voltage drop less than 0.7\nvolt . Switching times are typically\nless than 50 nanoseconds.\nSchottky diodes have long been\nattractive for high-power applications by virtue of their reduced\npower loss in forward conduction\nand their rapid recovery time compared with pn junction rectifiers .\nThese advantages, however, are\nbalanced by the inherent disadvantages of greater reverse leakage\nMETAL\n\ncurrent, lower reverse-bias breakdown voltage , and far greater variability than their pn junction counterparts in electrical characteristics\ndue to processing difficulties.\nNew-process Schottky diodes\nwere fabricated in a mesa geometry\nas shown in Figure 1. Epitaxiallygrown n-type silicon 10 to 15\nmicrons thick, ranging in resistivity\nfrom 1 to 4 Q-cm , was used as\nstarting material. Silicon nitride\n(Si]N J was used as an etch mask to\ndefine the mesa top, which eventually comprises the a,ytive device\narea. Mesas 8,000 A high were\nformed by etching away the unprotected silicon with an HNO]:HF\netch. Wafers were oxidized at\n\nCOPPER\n\n1,832\xc2\xb0 F (1,273 K) in steam\nfollowed by a 1,83\'Z\' F argon anneal\nto paSSivate the mesa sides and\nreduce leakage currents. The same\nSi 3N. mask that served to define the\nmesa top due to its resistance to the\nmesa etch also protects the silicon\nagainst oxidation . In this way, the\nSi0 2 mesa passivation is automatically prevented from extending\nonto the mesa top , and the metal\nbarrier, to be formed later, will\npreCisely cover the mesa top. A\nconventional POCI] gettering step\nwas required in order to produce\nhard non leaky junctions. It was\nperformed either before or after\nmesa formation and passivation.\nThe barrier itself is formed as\nfollows. First, the Si/J.etch mask is\nremoved with hot H3PO., Next, the\nexposed silicon is lightly sputteretched to remove surface impurities\nand any heavily doped regions at the\nsurface formed during the getter\n\nTUNGSTEN DISK\n\nPb-Sn-Ag SOLDER\n\n~~~~~~~~~~!I.!ijMF--\n\nPtSI CONTACT\nSILICON CHIP\no\n\n1,000 A TI\n\nDEPLETION\nLAYER\nBOUNDARY\n\nFigure 1.

In this way, the\nPtSi Schottky metalization covers\nthe enti re mesa top right up to the\nSi0 2 boundary and prevents edge\nbreakdown and surface leakage.\nIn the assembly phase (Figure 2),\nthe pretested chips were first\neutectic-bonded to tungsten backup\nplates at a temperature of 9320 F\n(773 K) .

Contacts that work well with\n~type GaAs work poorly with\nGa 1-xAlxAs. For example , a Au-Zn\ncontact works very well for ~type\nGaAs but is unsuccessful with\nGaO.3AI0.7As, even when the latter\nis diffused with zinc to raise the\nacceptor concentration level. This\ncontradiction in requirements has\ncomplicated the fabrication of\nreliable Ga1-xAlxAs/GaAs solar\ncells, particularly when the GaAIAs\nlayer is less than 1", in depth, due to\nthe high series resistance resulting\nfrom the poor contacting. Diffusing\nthe cell with zinc and annealing it at\na high temperature after contact\nevaporation can lower the contact\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1977\n\nresistance to an acceptable level,\nbut the high-temperature process\noften ruins the cell .\nLow-resistance contacts for\nGaAlAsI GaAs cells have now been\nmade by using palladium to contact\nthe GaAlAs, followed by gold, silver,\nchromium, or <!Iuminum for bonding.\nTypically, 500 A of palladium are 0\napplied, followed by about 5,000 A\nof aluminum. The palladium forms\nan ohmic contact of low resistance\nto undiffused GaAIAs, as well as to\ndiffused materials. Low-temperature\nannealing at 300\xc2\xb0 C with aluminum\nstrongly bonds the palladium and the\nGaAIAs. (Firing temperatures even\nas high as 5000 C with gold or silver\ncontacts does not produce equivalent results.) The palladium can be\napplied by evaporation, sputtering,\n\nor electro less plating, using a palladous chloride solution.\nThe ohmic contact obtained by\nthis method greatly reduces the\nseries resistance and increases the\nreliability of GaAlAs/GaAs solar\ncells. The results obtain~d have not\nbeen achieved by any other metallurgy to date, and this technique is\nalso applicable to the fabrication of\nlasers such as the room-temperature heterojunction laser.\nThis work was done by H.

Radiation-hardening techniques can be incorporated into its\nprocessing with no degradation in\nperformance.\nThese results are achieved by\nforming an integrated-circuit CMOS\nincluding an asymmetrical doublediffused metal-oxide-semiconductor\n(DMOS) transistor as half of the\ncomplementary pair and a\nV-notched metal-oxide-semiconductor (VMOS) transistor as the\nother half of the pair. The figure\nshows this arrangement.\nThe device has a fast response\ntime because both the DMOS and\nVMOS transistors have high-speed\nchannels . The asymmetric DMOS\nhas fast transit time across the\nchannel because a carrier is\naccelerated as it crosses the n-type\nmaterial between the p+ layer and\nthe p- well. (In contrast, in a symmetric DMOS configuration, a\ncarrier is both accelerated and\ndecelerated as it crosses the\nrelatively-short channel length .)\nBecause double diffusion in the\nDMOS transistor occurs only on the\np+ side of the device where the\nsource electrode is located, there is\na relatively-high voltage breakdown\nbetween the source and drain electrodes of the DMOS transistor.\nThe V-notched transistor has a\nfast response time because it has a\nrelatively-short channel length. The\nshort channel is achieved without\nsacrificing the voltage breakdown\ncharacteristics of the device. It is\nmade by diffusing successive p+\nand n+ regions into the p- well, and\nthen cutting a V-shaped notch along\nthe edge of the p+ region (see\nfigure) . Thus there are three regions\nalong one side of the V-notch - p- ,\np+ , and n+ - and only two regions\n\n434\n\nComplementary Transistors, a p-channel DMOS and an n-channel\nVMOS, both feature asymmetrical double diffusion for high-speed\noperation and high breakdown voltage. Their combination has all of the\nadvantages of conventional CMOS devices.\nalong the other side. The channel is\nformed through the p+ region on the\nthree-region side, between the pwell and the n+ contacting region .\nThe V-notch is formed on a plane\nhaving a crystalline surface state of\n<111> in a substrate having a crystalline structure of <100>. This\nstructure results in a shift in the\nthreshold voltage of the well; the\nwell has a low impedance with zero\nbias applied to a metalized gate\nelectrode that covers an oxide layer\nformed over exposed portions of the\nwell and diffusion layers in the\nnotch. With zero bias, there is no\nconduction through the p+ region.\nConduction occurs when a forward\nbias voltage at the gate electrode\ncauses charges to flow across the\nrelatively short length of this region .\nThe breakdown voltage is relatively\nhigh because the avalance current,\nwhich must be achieved before\nbreakdown results, must be through\nthe relatively high concentration of\nthe p+ channel of the three-region\nedge to the diffusion layer along the\nother edge of the notch.\nThe DMOS and VMOS devices\nhave been fabricated with channel\n\nlengths of between 0.5 and 1.0\nmicrometer. Devices having theoretical cutoff frequencies of approximately 2 GHz were formed, with\nmaximum transconductances of 190\nmicromhos for the p-channel DMOS\ntransistor and 490 micromhos for\nthe n-channel VMOS transistor. The\nn-channel and p-channel transistor\nwidths were 1 .1 mils (28 micrometers) and 0.7 mil (18 micrometers),\nrespectively. The absolute value of\nthe threshold voltage of the individual devices was between 0.8 and\n4.0 volts; the inverter was found to\noperate satisfactorily for supply voltages ranging from 2 to 15 volts.\nThis work was done by Murzban\nD.

A wafer of a single-crystal\nsemiconductor, such as silicon, may\nbe bonded to the diode to produce a\ncollector with an extremely low work\nfunction . It has been found that\nthese materials can be bonded by\nraising the substrate temperature to\naround 1,100" C and cooling it at a\nslow controlled rate .\nBefore bonding, the interfacing\nsurfaces must be carefully prepared. A typical as-received silicon\n\nwafer has a lapped and polished\nplanar surface with a native-grown\noxide; the oxide can be removed\nwith a hydrofluoric acid dip and a\ndistilled-water rinse immediately\nprior to processing. Surface oxidation is removed from the smoothmachined and lightly-polished molybdenum substrate by electrolytic\ncleaning in sulfuric acid and distilledwater rinsing just prior to\nprocessing.\nThe exact substrate temperature\nat which bonding begins is a function of the thermal conductivity at\nthe interface; this depends on the\n\ncleanliness and flatness of the surfaces to be bonded.

The switch\nremains open during most of each\nhalf cycle and then is closed for a\nshort time so that energy can be\ndelivered to the load . The transformer primary voltage falls to zero\nwhile the switch is open , so the\naverage primary voltage is greatly\nreduced. With fewer volt-seconds\nimpressed on the transformer during\neach half cycle , a given core can\n\nhave fewer turns per volt and\ntherefore can use larger wire . The\nsecondary voltage is regulated by\nvarying the phase angle at which the\nswitch is closed .\nA conventional power-transformer / rectifier circuit was breadboarded and tested . Then a\nregulator employing the technique\nillustrated in Figure 1 was designed\nwith a modified transformer that had\nfewer turns of larger wi re. This\ncircuit also was breadboarded and\ntested .

The input volt-\n\nage Signal (Ein) is applied to the\nopen-loop amplifier U1 . The output\nof U1 goes to the \'input of unity-gain\ninverting amplifier U2 and to one\nside of the load.

The\nsensed output is amplified by U3\n(gain\nA) and is applied to the\ninverting input of U1, completing the\nloop.\nSince the load is not referenced to\nground, the susceptibility of the\ncircuit to noise and electromagnetic\ninterference is reduced . Also, since\nthe voltage applied to the load is\ndouble that provided by a groundreferenced configuration (except for\na small drop across RS), a higher\nvoltage range is available with\nlower-voltage power supplies; this\ncan save weight, space, and cost in\nmany applications.

Unlike other twisted pairs ,\nthis cable is fabricated with carefully-controlled electrical characteristics and can function without\ntuning networks at frequencies up to\n10 MHz. It requires no special connectors, is lightweight, and is\nsmaller in diameter than all-Teflon\ninsulated cables . Attenuation is\ntypically less than 1 .5 dB per 100ft.\nTypical electrical characteristics\nof the cable, using 24-gage conductors, are shown in the table .\nThe construction of the cable is\nshown in the figure. The inner conductors are nickel-coated stranded\ncopper alloy with extruded-Teflon\ninsulation , twisted 15 to 20 turns per\nfoot. High-strength copper is used\nfor conductors smaller than\n22-gage.

It is also\nlighter in weight than brush\ntachometers.\nThe tachometer uses two Halleffect devices mounted in the flux\npath of a magnet on the rotating\nshaft (see figure). The Hall devices\nare arranged 90\xc2\xb0 apart with respect\nto the poles of the magnet and are\nsupplied with excitation voltages of\nconstant frequency and amplitude\nbut 90\xc2\xb0 out of phase. The devices are\nconnected in series, to produce an\noutput frequency that increases for\none rotational direction and decreases for the other. This signal is\n\nconditioned and filtered to give a dc\noutput proportional to the speed. Its\npolarity indicates direction.\nThe Hall devices are small chips\nof silicon containing impurities such\nas indium arsenide. When a current\nis passed through each device in the\npresence of a magnetic field, it produces a transverse output voltage\nthat has a magnitude that is dependent on the product of the excitation\ncurrent and the magnetic field .\nA signal generator supplies a\nsinusoidal excitation current at a\ncarrier frequency wc. The signal is\nfed through an operational amplifier\ndirectly to one Hall device; and the\nresistor R1 and capacitor C1 shift\nthe phase of the current by 90\xc2\xb0 at\nthe input to the other device. The\nmagnetic fields seen by the devices\noscillate at the shaft frequency Ws\nand are separated by 90 electrical\n\nOPERATIONAL\nAMPLIFIER\n\nHALL\xc2\xb7EFFECT\nDEVICE\n\nMAGNET\n\nG])\n\ndegrees. Trigonometric identities\nverify that the output signal from the\nseries combination is either the sum\nor difference of the carrier and shaft\nfrequencies, depending on whether\nthe shaft is turning clockwise or\ncounterclockwise.\nFor zero shaft speed, the output is\nsimply the carrier frequency. It\nshould be at least five times greater\nthan the maximum shaft frequency\nso that the output frequency varies\n20 percent above and below the carrier. A stable oscillator should be\nused. The summed output of the two\nHall-effect devices is fed to a zerocrossing detector that produces a\nsquare-wave output with a frequency that increases in proportion to increasing shaft speed for\none direction of rotation and decreases in proportion to increasing\nshaft speed for the opposite\ndirection.\nFrom this point on, the circuitry is\nsimilar to that in conventional tachometers. The square wave is differentiated to form narrow voltage\nspikes that drive a one-shot multivibrator.

For further information,\nWhen the shaft is not turning, the\nfrequency (we) of the pulse train out\nof the multivibrator produces a constant bias voltage. This bias is nulled\nby introducing an equal and opposite voltage into the final op amp\nfrom a reference, so that the circuit\noutput is zero volts for zero shaft\nspeed. As the shaft turns, the dc output increases for clockwise rotation\n\nfor the transducers. For example,\noptical encoders, electromagnetic\nresolvers, or electronic multipliers\nmight be substituted.\nUnlike conventional tachometers,\nthe ripple voltage of the new circuit\nis low because the frequency even for zero rpm - is always high.\nThus, the circuit is accurate even at\nvery low turning speeds.\n\nCircle 68 on the TSP Request Card.\nThis invention has been patented\nby NASA [u.

These circuits produce an output that is proportional to the cosine\nof the phase angle between the input\nsignal and a reference, so that their\nindication is zero when the angle is\n90\xc2\xb0, has a maximum when it is 00 ,\nand is a minimum when it is 1800.\nThus, the phase is identified over\nonly two quadrants, with one quadrant represented by a positive voltage and the other by a negative\nvoltage.\nFor some applications, it is necessary to have a phase detector that\ncovers all four quadrants, preferably\nwith a linear rather than cosine indication. This requirement is met by\nthe phase-detection circuit, shown\nin the figure . The circuit functions\nover a full 360\xc2\xb0 and gives a linear\noutput that is proportional to the\nphase difference. In addition, its\noutput has a single polarity; thus, it\nis compatible with logic circuitry\nwithout the need for additional\nprocessing .\nAs seen in the figure, the input\nsignals (V1 and V2) are fed to operational amplifiers that are wired as\nzero-crossing detectors. The zerocrossing detectors produce negative\nvoltages when their inputs swing\npositive . They can be selected so\nthat the transitions occur for arbitrarily small input signals (limited\nonly by the inherent noise of the devices) . Thus the outputs are square\nwaves with the same phase relationship as the original signals.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nVarious codes have been developed to detect bit errors automatically in computer-data transmission.\nBits can be received incorrectly due\nto hardware failures, noise, or other\ntransmission faults. The errordetecting codes are implemented by\ntransmitting the data according to a\nprescribed pattern; deviations from\nthe pattern at the receiving end\nindicate that tne data are faulty.\nTwo new codes have been developed to provide fail-safe operation of\na launch processing and control\nsystem in which a common memory\nis the coordination point for the\ninterconnection of up to 64 minicomputers. High reliability is clearly\nneeded since a single failure in the\nmemory could knock out the entire\nsystem.\nThe new codes, termed "modified\nb-adjacent interleaving codes," are\nmore effective than the standard\nerror-detecting codes, including the\nmany varieties of Hamming and\nBCH codes. They are 16 bits in\n\n458\n\nlength and contain 8 data bits\n[denoted (16,8)] ; the codes satisfy\nthe following requirements:\n-correct all Single random-bit errors\nand detect all random double-bit\nerrors,\n-correct all single double-adjacentbit errors on an even/odd hardware\nboundary,\n-detect all combinations of two\ndouble-adjacent-bit errors over the\nsame even/odd hardware\nboundary,\n-convert to codes that can correct\nall Single four-adjacent-bit errors\non an even/odd hardware\nboundary, and\n-detect a data stream of all 1\'s or all\nO\'s as an uncoriectable error.\nTo implement code 1, a special\nsymbol , d, defined by\nd\n\ni5\n\n~ 6J\n\nis inserted into the data section of\nthe parity matrix of any maximum\ndistance (8,4) code, such that the\n\n(1)\n\ncode remains balanced (Le ., one d\nper row) .

In addition to its meeting the above requirements, this code detects 94.1\npercent of possible double-adjacent\nerrors of 3, 4, 5, or 6 bits involving\nthree hardware failures on an\neven/odd boundary.\nFor code 2, the d symbols are\nsubstituted for the 1\'s in the diagonal\nof the data section of an (8,4) oddweighted column code.

For instance, the heat\nexchanger must have two walls\nbetween the heated-water source\nand the potable water to be heated.\nMost heat exchangers employing\nthis principle sacrifice considerable\nefficiency to gain the extra measure\nof insurance against contamination\nof the domestic water supply.\nA double-walled heat-exchanger\nproposed for solar collectors would\nretain most of the efficiency of\nsingle-walled exchangers and\nincludes an automatic indication of\nleaks in either of the two walls. Of\ncourse, it could be also used with\n462\n\nnonsolar heat sources using water\nas a heat-transfer medium.\nThe new heat exchanger, shown\nin the figure, consists of four spiralrolled metal tubes installed within\nconcentric smooth metal tubes.\nEach spiral tube touches, or is very\nclose to, the surrounding smooth\ntube . Heat-transfer fluid from the\nsolar collector flows inside the\nspiral-walled tubes; the potable\nwater to be heated flows around the\noutside of the smooth tubes . The\nmany contact points between the\ntwo tubes transfer heat efficiently,\nyet the spi ral void between the tubes\nserves as a path for any leaked fluid\nto leave the exchanger.\nIn operation, both the solarcollector loop and the domestic\n\nwater are under pressure. If a leak\noccurs in either tube, water will be\nforced into the nonpressurized\nspace between the spiral and\nsmooth tubes. The excess water will\nultimately flow out weep holes in the\nwall of the exchanger housing . By\nplacing a nontoxic dye in the space\nbetween the tubes, leaks can be\nidentified readily.\nA potable liquid (e .g., glycerine)\nwith a boiling point higher than that\nof water could be used between the\ntubes to improve heat transfer. A\npowdered metal, or metal granules,\ncould also be placed between\' the\ntubes as long as they are porous and\nchemically compatible with the heatexchanger walls and fluids.

The device is essentially a conventional\nthermometer that has been almost\ntotally isolated from convective and\nconductive heat transfer with its surroundings. Therefore, its temperature (and its liquid level) is determined mainly by the incident radiation intensity and by radiative heat\ntransfer. Its reading is somewhat dependent on the ambient temperature; however, this effect is predictable and can be accounted for\nby proper calibration.\nThe thermometer is encased in\nan evacuated transparent-glass or\nplastic jacket to isolate it from the\n\nsurroundings. Its reservoir is spherical to present a constant surface\narea as the Sun moves across the\nsky. Thus it will maintain its calibration for any time of day or year (for a\ngiven ambient temperature).\nAny liquid that does not freeze or\nboil at the combined radiation intensities and ambient temperatures to\nwhich it is exposed can be used. For\nthe range of conditions encountered\nin the U.S., mercury is a good\nchoice.\nThe capillary must be long\nenough to accommodate the expected expansion of the fluid. For\nexample, mercury in a capillary\n0.005 in . (0 .13 mm) in diameter and\na O.20-in. 3 (3.28-cm3 ) reservoir will\nrise 6 in. (15 cm) as the radiation intensity increases from zero to 330\n\nBtu/h-ft2 (249 cal/s-m2), the maximum solar intensity expected in the\nUnited States.\nThe mounting is coated with a\nlow-reflectivity paint so that it does\nnot reflect radiation into the reservoir. The reservoir is exposed to the\nSun \'s rays; however, it may be\nnecessary to shield the capillary.\nFor steady-state operation, the\nthermal energy into the device (determined by the solar intensity and\nconstants such as the transmittance\nof the glass reservoir) is balanced by\nthe thermal energy out (determined\nby the temperature difference between the reservoir and the air outside and the radiation properties of\nthe reservoir). This energy balance\nallows the solar intensity to be related to the reservoir temperature and\n(continued next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1977\n\n463\n\n(I\n\nCONVENTIONAL\nTHERMOMETER\n(OPTIONAL)\n,-_MOUNT\n\n--;r--.-\n\nANTI REFLECTIVE\nCOATING\n\nRADIATION\nINTENSITY\n(Btu/h-ft2)\n\nF\'\n\nVACUUM\nI.-------~---JACK~\n\n~--l------_+- CAPILLARY\nTUBE\n\nIIJ-;-----!._ SPHERICAL\n\nRESERVOIR\n\nultimately to the volume of the expanding liquid.

These\nreasons , however, are invalid in\ncertain situations . Although less\nfouling should occur inside the\ncollectors (through which the flow\nvelocity is greater than that across a\nheat exchanger immersed in a\nstorage tank), fouling would still be\nexpected to occur on the exterior of\nthe heat exchangers. In areas that\nrarely freeze , freeze protection is\n\n464\n\npreferably provided by a frost cycle\nin the autocontrol ; automatic circulation would occur when the\ncollectors reach a preset temperature just above freezing . In these\nsituations, the use of direct heating,\nrather than a heat exchanger, is\npossible.\nFor those installations that experience regular and frequent freezes ,\nthe use of direct heating and a frost\ncycle are not preferred, since too\nmuch energy is consumed operating\nthe automatic circulation equi~\nment. For these installations, a\npositive drainage system , such as a\ndump tank, is required .\n\nA new five-port ganged valve isolates the collectors from the primary\nload (system pressure) and drains\nthe collectors , allowing the use of\ndirect heating with all its advantages . The valve, shown providing\nthis direct-dump option in a collector\nflow line in the figure , could be\nopened and closed by the same\nswitch that controls the pump , or by\na temperature sensor set at 3~ F\n(CJ\' C) plus some small safety\nmargin.

This is largely due to the eX1ensive use of formed metal parts for\nthe collector plates and for the\ntubing , channeling, or the equivalent\nthat circulate the energy-collection\nfluid (usually water) within the\ncollector.\nIn a proposed design , heat would\nbe removed from the collector plate\neffectively by bringing the collector\n\nfluid into direct contact with the\nabsorber plate without the use of\ntubing or channeling . As can be\nseen in the figure, this could be\naccomplished by spraying the collector fluid onto the undersurface of\nthe collector plate. This would\nproduce a convective heat-transfer\ncoefficient large enough so that only\nminimal spatial temperature variations would occur in the plane of the\nabsorber. Consequently, the\nrequirement for high in-plane\nthermal conductance, a necessity\nfor collectors with absorbers that\n\nmust conduct absorbed solar energy\nto attached fluid conduits, would be\neliminated .

Such connections are\nneeded between the fluid boiler,\nwhich is mounted at the focal point\nof the parabolic collection surface ,\nand the ground-supported heat\nengine that utilizes the collected\nenergy.\nThese connections might be eliminated by mounting the boiler in fixed\npositon at the parabolic collector\nfocuses . In a fixed position, hard line\n\n466\n\nconnections capable of withstanding\nthe optimum high-temperature fluid\nflow can be utilized to connect the\nboiler and the heat engine .\nA proposed type of solar-tracker\ncollector assembly (shown in the\nfigure) makes this possible. Two\nconcentric circular tracks are\nplaced about a vertical axis in a\nshallow spherical hole in the ground.\nThe boiler is mounted in a fixed\nposition over the hole . The tracks\nsupport a frame that can be moved\naround the perimeter of the hole\n(shifted in azimuth). This " azimuth\nframe " in turn supports an elevation\nframe that rides up and down the\nside of the bowl . The elevation frame\n\nsupports the parabolic mirror or\nreflector, which focuses the incident\nsolar energy on the fixed boiler at all\nazimuths and elevations .\nThe elevation frame is counterbalanced by a cable and a weight\nsystem. Pulleys for the cable are\nattached to the azimuth frame, and\nthe cable is attached to the elevation\nframe . The weight falls into a circular ditch on the shady side of the\nbowl . The counterbalanced weight\nleaves the elevation drive system\nwith only frictional losses to be overcome . The reflector elevates at a\nslow (sidereal) rate and can be\nreadily driven by a small motor with\na very large gear reduction.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1977\n\nThe Two-Axis Movable Concentrating Solar-Energy Collector could be\nmounted in a spherical hole in the ground. The boiler position would be\nfixed at the parabolic collector focuses, eliminating the need for flexible\nor slip connections for transporting high-temperature fluid between the\nboiler and the heat engine.\n\nThe fixed position of the boiler\neliminates the high cost of flexible\nand movable connections and\nreduces length of the ul>-and-down\npiping; thus construction costs can\nbe reduced, maintenance requirements can be lessened. and reliability and flexibility are improved.\nThe low wind profile of this belowground installation also contributes\nto overall optimization.

The device, which uses a rotating Dove prism assembly to form\na stationary image of a rotating object (such as the output of multiple\noptical transmitters), can handle\nmany high-bit-rate data channels.

Therefore,\nthe image rotates at twice the rotation speed of the prism .

The\nretroreflective pattern can be\ntailored to suit specific requirements; for example, it could be used\nto aline a distant surface normal to\na beam of laser light.\nThe reflector, seen in the figure,\nconsists of a dielectric sheet, transparent to the wavelength of interest,\nwith identical patterns of black\n(opaque) pigment deposited on both\nsides in a precisely matching relationship. One of the sides is backed\nby a white surface having a roughness that makes it a good light\nscatterer at the wavelength of\ninterest.\nIncident light normal to the reflector passes through the two layers\nof black pigment, seen in perfect\nregister, and illuminates the\nexposed white surface. Light is\ndiffusely scattered by the white surface and is returned to the direction\nof incidence. As seen, light incident\nat an oblique angle illuminates a\nportion of the white scattering surface, which is smaller as the angle\nof incidence increases, resulting in a\ndecrease of backscattered energy.\nThree methods for generating the\nrandom pattern of black pigment\nhave been proposed. In one method,\nmicroscopic pigmented resin\nparticles could be dispersed in a\nchamber and allowed to settle on a\nclean glass plate until they cover\napproximately 50 percent of the\nglass surface.

However, as the angle e increases, the area of exposed\nwhite surface decreases, reducing the reflected wave front and giving\nthe intensity pattern shown.

Turbulence not only degrades\nresolution but also absorbs large\nportions of the electromagnetic\nspectrum. Telescopes placed in\nspace , however, offer opportunities\nto perform extraterrestrial observations without interference from the\natmosphere. To take full advantage\nof space astronomy, new telescopes\nare needed that have high resolution\nover a wide field of view. These telescopes should also be all-reflective,\nto cover the spectral range from the\nfar ultraviolet to the far infrared.\nThe Ritchey-Chretien, an\nimproved version of the classical\nCassegrain , is today\'s most popular\ntelescope . However, this two-mirror\nsystem has a rather limited field of\nview and does not have a flat image\nsurface. To widen and flatten the\nfield , refractive correctors are\nsometimes added, but this approach\nnarrows the spectral response.\nAlthough several three-mirror telescopes have been proposed, none\nprovides a practical solution. The\nmain shortcomings are the inaccessibility of the image plane , large\ncentral obscuration, and the\nfast-focal ratio forced by the configurations.\nThe proposed three-mirror telescope shown in the figure provides\nvery high resolution over a flat field\nof 1.50 \xe2\x80\xa2 This is considerably better\nthan the best two-mi rror telescope\nwhich gives the same resolution\nover only a few arc-minutes in a\ncurved field.

The secondary Image is relmaged by a tertiary mirror at\napproximately unit magnification. A flat perforated fold mirror is placed\nbetween the primary and tertiary so that the perforation coincides with\nthe exit pupil of the terltiary.\nMost practical two-mirror configurations can be corrected for only\ntwo aberrations (usually spherical\naberration and coma); this threemirror telescope is corrected for\nfour aberrations: spherical aberration , coma , astigmatism, and field\ncurvature. The mathematical conditions for correcting these aberrations can be solved for all pertinent\ndesign parameters by standard\ntechniques .

This type of pump weighs\nabout 90 kilograms owing to the\nlarge permanent magnets that provide the strong magnetic fields required for confining electrons in the\ndischarge. The weight and cost of\nthe maser unit are reduced significantly by replacing the large ion\npump with a hydrogen sorption\npump and a miniature ion pump.\nThe sorption pump acts as a\n"getter," having a cartridge with a\nvery large surface area of activated\nzirconium and aluminum sintered on\na thin stainless-steel substrate. The\nsheet is bent back and forth over\nitself and is formed into a cylindrical\narray in the same manner as an\nautomotive oil filter . The cartridge ,\nwhich is normally stored in an inert\ngas to prevent contamination, is\nactivated at about 75CJ\' C under a\nvacuum . If the cartridge is to cope\n\nwith non hydrogen products , it is kept\nhot, though at a lower temperature.\nWhen the su rface becomes\nsaturated with active gas products ,\na new surface can be prepared by\nreactivation of the vacuum system .\nAfter total saturation , the cartridge\nis easily replaced with a fresh one. If\nit is primarily to absorb hydrogen, as\nin the maser application, the cartridge does not have to be heated.\nHydrogen goes into solid solution,\nand its pumping speed is independent of temperature . It can be\nreleased from a saturated cartridge\nby a rise in temperature .\nIn the maser system, the miniature ion pump removes residual air,\nargon, hydrocarbons, and other\nnonhydrogen gases. A typical ion\npump has a capacity of 0.21/s and\npumps hydrogen as well as other\ngases. Hydrocarbons are apparently\nbroken up by the ion pump, but\neventually only the carbon is\npumped, and the sorption cartridge\n\nremoves the hydrogen . In small\nquantities, argon is pumped effectively ; but if there is a small atmospheric leak, argon can concentrate.\nIf this happens, the ion pump can\nbecome unstable, regurgitating the\nargon and repumping it cyclically.\nIn one maser system, consisting\nof well-outgassed metal , a few "0"\nrings , and large surfaces of Teflon\nand vacuum epoxy, the combination\nion pump and sorption cartridge was\noperated continuously without\nfailure for nearly a year.\nThis work was done by the\nSmithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory for Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.

Instead of detecting\nthe electrons directly, a secondary\ngaseous species is used to trap\nthreshold-energy photoelectrons.\nThe resulting negative ions are then\ndetected in a mass spectrometer.\nThe technique has several advantages over conventional electron\nand threshold-photoelectron spectroscopy, including:\n-high resolution in final ion states\nthat can easily approach 3 to\n5 meV,\n-the suppression of autoionization\nfeatures that give rise to nonthreshold electrons , and\n-easy conversion of a conventional\nphotoionization mass spectrometer\nto the threshold device by the addition of a suitable trapping gas.\nTrapping gases such as CFCI 3 and\nSF~ have been used with the new\ntechnique. The gas is combined with\nthe species being studied , and the\nmixture is illuminated by narrowband radiation from a scanning\nmonochromator. Threshold photo-electrons are released when the\nincident photon energy corresponds\nto a vibrational or electronic energy\nlevel of the primary gas. Tile electrons attach themselves to the\ntrapping molecules and form negative ions that are detected by a\nquadrupole mass spectrometer. The\ntransit time of the ions is 50 JAs or\nlonger.

A common\ncoolant passage serves both cells,\nand sealing gaskets are only used at\nthe water-removal field between\nmodules. The design would require\nfewer parts and occupy less space\nthan conventional fuel cells; since it\nis simpler , the cell would be easier\nto assemble and maintain .\nA cross section of a typical\nmodule is shown in the figure .

With the new design,\nmost of the seals are eliminated;\nparts can therefore be thinner, and\nreactant and coolant heights can be\nminimized.

Negative ions are formed by collisions\n. with surfaces having a low work function.\n\nCaltechlJPL, Pasadena, California\nMost proposed controlled thermonuclear reactors (CTR\'s) require\nrapid heating and compression of\nthe fuel. However, limits on present\nheating techniques and mass loss\nfrom the confined plasma necessitate the use of auxiliary heating\nmethods. One promising approach\nhas been to inject energetic neutral\ndeuterium into the plasma after the\ninitial compression. The neutral\nparticles penetrate the magnetic\nfields and further heat the compressed plasma by collisional interaction .\nPresently, the neutral beam is\ncreated through several steps .\nPositive deuterium ions are first\n\npositive ions, because the detachment cross section does not fall off\nwith ion energy nearly as rapidly as\nthe charge-exchange cross section.\nHowever, present methods for\ncreating large quantities of negative\nions (such as adding two electrons\nto low-energy positive ions) do not\nappear to offer the necessary efficiencies and production rates.\nA new method that shows promise\ndirectly forms negative ions by surface ionization ; an atom (or a\nmolecule) strikes a surface of low\nwork function , extracts an electron ,\nand rebounds as a negative ion. By\nusing a low work-function surface of\ncoated porous material, a greater\nsurface area is presented to the\nsource gas, and ionization efficiency\nis improved.\n\nformed in a gas discharge and then\nare electrically accelerated to the\ndesired energy. The ion beam\npasses through a gas cell in which\ncharge-exchange collisions convert\nthe energetic ions to the energetic\nneutrals. Tens of amperes are\nreadily produced by this method at a\nfew tens of kilowatts, in millisecondduration pulses. However, future\ndemands of the CTR program will\nrequire beam energies of the order\nof 200 keV; at that level the chargeexchange cross section becomes\nvery small, and neutralization efficiency becomes poor .\nThe neutralization efficiency is\nlarger for negative ions than for\n\n(continued next page)\n\nPRELIMINARY\nACCELERATOR\nGRID\n/\n/\n"\n\n/\n\n/ \'V:,\n\nDIRECTENERGY\nCONVERTER\n\nPERMANENT\nMAGNET\n\n/\n\n,\n\n~~\n\nNEGATIVE\nIONS\n\nI\n\nMAIN\n. / ACCELERATOR\nGRID\nHIGH-ENERGY\nNEUTRALS\n\n~\n\n---7-t--- -;;E~;~;- ==v\nI\n\n~\n\nACCELERATOR\nSUBSYSTEM\n\n\\\n\nNEUTR!UZER\nSUBSYSTEM\n\nJ\n\nBEAM PUMP\nOR\nRECIRCULATOR\n\nProposed Negative Deuterium-Ion Source, shown here as part of a neutral beam generator for use with\ncontrolled thermonuclear reactors, uses a low work-function porous plug in the path of neutral deuterium\natoms; the ions are generated by collisions between the atoms and the porous surface. A magnet is used to\nseparate electrons (also generated in the ionizer) and neutral atoms from the negative ions.\nNASA Tech Briefs , W inter 1977\n\n475\n\nA neutral-beam generator\nemploying this approach is shown in\nthe figure. It can be divided into five\nmajor subsystems : dissociator,\nionizer, separator, accelerator, and\nneutralizer. The dissociator breaks\ndown diatomic molecules of\ndeuterium into the neutral atoms . It\nis located a short distance upstream\nof the ionizer. The actual dissociation takes place either by directing\nthe flow around a heated filament in\nthe flow tube or by an RF discharge\ncreated in a cavity in the line by coils\nor electrodes outside the line. The\natomic deuterium flows through the\nionizer, a porous plug of tungsten or\nactivated-nickel base metal coated\nwith a low work-function material,\nand collides with the porous surface .\n\nA transparent accelerating grid\nand a permanent magnet are used to\nseparate electrons (which are also\nemitted from the surface) , the\nnegative ions, and the neutral\natoms. A series of grids focuses and\ncollimates the ions and accelerates\nthem to high energy . The neutralizer\nsubsystem converts the negative\nions back to neutrals for injection\ninto the reactor.\nMost metals have intrinsic work\nfunctions (the amount of energy\nnecessary to remove an electron\nfrom the surface) between 4 and 5\neV. However, the work function can\nbe decreased to less than 2 eV by\nabsorbing a thin layer of an electropositive material, such as sodium,\npotaSSium , or cesium. Some photoemitter and thermionic-emitter\n\nmaterials have work functions lower\nthan 1.5 eV.\nThe application of low workfunction materials to the production\nof negative deuterium ions depends\non whether the surface is compatible with deuterium gas at its operating temperatures .\nThis work was done by Raymond\nGoldstein and James E.

In one application ,\na screw extruder (see figure) can\nfeed coal to a furnace operating at\nnear-ambient pressure. Crushed\ncoal is supplied to the hopper. The\nscrew compresses and plasticizes\nthe coal at a pressure of 2,000 to\n12,000 psi (14X10\' to 83x10\' N/m2)\nas it is heated to 7340 to 9140 F\n(3900 to 4900 C). The coal is forced\nthrough a die, and as it exits, volatile\ncomponents abruptly flash off. The\ndevolatilizing coal continuously disintegrates into a fine powder and\nvapor - a highly combustible\ncombination.\nAny mixture of coal sizes that will\nfit into the screw can be used. A\nscreen over the hopper excludes\npieces that are too large. The die\nshape and the direction of extrusion\ncan be designed to suit the furnace .\nIf a "ong combustion zone is needed,\nl\nthe coal jet can be extruded roughly\nparallel to the air jet entering the\nfurnace ; or, many orifices can\nextrude the coal radially and\ntangentially to promote mixing.\nThe same principle can be used to\npyrolyze coal - that is, to convert\ncoal into char , oil , and gases. These\nproducts , instead of being burned as\nthey emerge from the screw\nextruder, are collected separately\nfor use as chemicals or fuel . If the\nextrusion rate , extrusion temperature, temperature gradient, die and\norifice size and shape, and\nreceiving-chamber pressure and\ntemperature are regulated to suit\nthat particular coal , the coal can be\ndevolatilized to any degree .\nBecause screw extrusion ejects\ncoal at very high pressure, highpressure reactions can be carried\nout in the post-extrusion chamber\nunder conditions of high shear.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1977\n\nCOAL HOPPER\n\nA Screw Extruder Conveys Crushed Coal to a hot, intense-pressure\nregion and ejects it through a die as a fine spray. The spray can be\ndirected at an oxidizer for gaSification or directed into a furnace for\nburning. If the coal is mixed with water in the extruder in the presence of\ncatalysts, liquefaction and desulfurization occur; if it is mixed with\npowdered metallic ore and fluxing materials, the spray can be used for\nthe continuous reduction of ores.\nPressures approaching 12,000 psi\n(83)<10\' N/m2) are possible - far\n\nhigher than the 300 to 400 psi\n(2.06><10\' to 2.76><10\' N/m2)\npossible with conventional pressurized coal systems, such as lock\nhoppers.\nThese high pressures and high\nshear rates may liquefy and desulfurize coal. The coal is screw-extruded\ninto a vessel where temperature and\npressure are above the critical\npoints for water - 3,200 psi\n(22 .4><10\' N/rn2) and 7070 F (3740\nC) . Water containing a catalyst\n(sodium or potassium salts) is\npumped into the die.

While these methods\nare sound, they either destroy the\nsample or take a great deal of time.\nA new method for uranium analysis is both nondestructive and relatively fast. The technique involves\nsimultaneous irradiation of an unknown rock sample, a standard\nsample, and mica detectors in a\nspecial vacuum assembly. By maintaining a relatively large separation\nbetween the rock sample and its detector (compared with the scale of\nsample nonuniformity), the integrated track density in the detector\nrepresents the whole-rock uranium\nconcentration.\nAs seen in the accompanying\nfigure, a long tube holds the samples, detectors, glass standards, and\nspacers for irradiation. The entire\nassembly is placed in a reactor. To\navoid material activation and to reduce track background, fused quartz\nis used for the spacers, and nylon is\nused for the vacuum tube and caps.\nThe spacers are notched at both\nends to allow air to pass during\nevacuation.\nThe bottom end of this vacuumtube assembly has a screwcap O-ring\nseal; the top is a sliding plug that\nmaintains the compression placed\non the samples and detectors during\nirradiation. The sliding plug is guided\nby nylon screws attached to the\nvacuum tube body. The detector\nmaterial is very-low-uranium mica\nthat has been etched to remove ressidual tracks.\nThe assembly may be evacuated\nbefore irradiation and sealed off by\ncrimping or by valving.

Until now,\nefforts to solidify Pb-Sb eutectic with\nthe expected plasticity and desired\naverage density have not met with\nsuccess. Although portions of a melt\ndo solidify into a chinese eutectic\nstructure of the proper composition\n(88.8 percent Pb), invariably there is\nalso some segregation that appears\nto be primary crystallization. It has\nbeen speculated that this occurs\nbecause the eutectic tends to supercool, setting up a nonequilibrium\ncondition that shifts its composition.\n\nA new study of the solidification of\neutectic Pb-Sb has found that this\ninterpretation of the segregation\nprocess is not correct. Microstructures of eutectic, hypoeutectic, and\nhypereutectic alloys of Pb-Sb were\nstudied after solidification in both\n"microgravity" and at 1 g. In all\ncases, the apparent primary crystallization product formed in the solidified material . Centrifuge experiments were conducted to determine\nthe temperature at which these\ncomponents formed. The experiments conclusively showed that the\nsystem forms a "divorced eutectic"\nthat appears to be primary crystallization, but actually forms at the\neutectic temperature. Some of the\neutectic forms as blocky primary Sb\n\nsurrounded by eutectic rich in Pb\ndendrites.\nThis secondary eutectic phase\ncan be removed by applying a high\ncentrifugal field (1 ,000 g\'s) during\nsolidification .

The problem goes beyond\nsimply finding defects such as\ndelaminations, inclusions, and\nsimilar discontinuities. CompoSites\ncan often be free of overt defects yet\nstill have inadequate strength . These\ninadequacies may result from poor\nprocessing during fabrication or\nfrom degradation during use. Lowerthan-acceptable strength can, for\nexample, result from microvoids\ndistributed throughout the compOSite\nstructure . Currently, nondestructive\nevaluation can find overt discontinuities or gross damage, but better\ntechniques are needed to evaluate\nthe actual strength and endurance\nproperties of composite materials.\nThese new techniques must be\n484\n\nsensitive to factors that cannot be\nevaluated by conventional methods.\nPreviously, measurement of the\nattenuation of ultrasonic waves had\nbeen used to evaluate strengthrelated factors in various materials.\nThe method described herein has\ncapabilities that are not available in\ncurrent ultrasonic methods for\nevaluating composites . The prime\nadvantage is that a single number\nproduced correlates closely with the\nstrength properties of the composite. Also, the method requires\naccess to only one side of a part, an\nimportant advantage when only one\nsurface is readily accessible .\nThe principle involves the introduction of simulated stress waves in\na composite structure . These stress\nwaves are ultrasonic and resemble\nthe resonant waves that would occur\n\nfrom microfractures if the material\nwere to undergo a destructive test,\nbut they cause no damage. However, as the simulated stress waves\npropagate through the material,\ntheir character is strongly affected\nby the same factors that influence\nstrength properties. After they have\npropagated a fixed distance through\nthe material, the stress waves are\nanalyzed. One result of analysis is a\nsingle numerical value, called\n"stress-wave factor, " that relates to\nvariations in phYSical properties of\nthe test specimen and thus to\nstrength characteristics such as\ninterlaminar shear strength . This\nnumber is a relative value ; but by\ncalibrating against a similar object\nwith a known strength , the actual\nstrength of the test object can be\nstated .

The\ncenter frequency of the input\nultrasonic transducer is selected to\noptimize the response of the test\nobject to the input wavelength; i.e.,\nto achieve a resonance or nearresonance condition. Consequently,\nthe test object experiences a continuously repeating series of\nsimulated acoustic emissions\nemanating from one place on the\nobject and resembling the stresswave " bursts" that accompany\nmicrofractures in a material under\nstress .\nA waveguide pickup is coupled to\nthe surface of the test object at\nsome fixed distance from the input\nsource. A component of the simulated stress wave is transmitted to a\nreceiving transducer at the end of\nthe waveguide . The bandwidth\nsensitivity of the receiving transducer is selected for optimum\nresponse in the frequency domain of\nthe simulated stress wave . Waves\narriving at the receiver location are\nattenuated and dispersed. At the\nreceiver pickup, the amplitude and\ndecay mode are proportional to the\nenergy loss suffered by the wave\nafter having propagated through the\ntest object. The received wave, as\nmodulated by the material , relates to\nthe strength of the material between\nthe input and output probes.\nThe apparatus shown in the figure\nprovides a simple and effective\nmeans of measuring the energy\ncontent of the received signals.

Nylon, for\nexample, can be leached from the\nlaminate by boiling in 5 percent\nhydrochloric acid. The degree of\nporosity can be controlled by the\nfugitive-fiber diameter and by the\ndensity of the stitches (per unit\narea). The stitching can be done by\n\nhand, on a conventional sewing\nmachine or carpet-tufting\nequipment. or by any other economIcal method.\nThe graphite/ epoxy prepreg is\nformed in sheets and is cut into\nlamina of the correct size and\nshape . The layers are stacked and\nencased in Teflon separator sheets\n0.5 to 1 mil (0 .01 to 0.03 mm) thick.\nIn early tests , this composite was\nleft with a rough surface due to\nstitched-fiber impressions remaining\nin the lamina. Therefore, lined\npolyester-film sheets 8 mils (0.2\nmm) in thickness were used to\nencase the layup; this considerably\nreduced the stitched-fiber markoff.\nOther techniques for obtaining a\nsmooth surface are being explored.\nOne promising method is to abrade\nexcess resin mechanically from the\nface surface on the side from which\nthe needlepoint exits. As the stitching needle enters the layup, a\n\nchamfer is formed ; then , as the\nneedlepoint exits from the OPPOSite\nside , a burr that remains after curing\nis raised . Smooth surfaces can be\nproduced by abrading this burr.\nThe technique was found to work\nwell with graphite/ epoxy fabric as\nthe base material . Two types of\nmonofilament nylon stitching were\ntested : fishing lines, rated from 2\nthrough 8 pounds (8.9 through 35.6\nnewtons) and a 10-mll (0 .25-mm)\nnylon monofilament supplied directly\nfrom the manufacturer. Those fibers\nless than 8 mils (0.2 mm) were\nfound difficult to dissolve .\nThis work was done by R. T. Beall\nand A. O.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe standard procedure for bonding room-temperature-vulcanizing\nsilicon rubber to itself is to apply a\nfreshly-mixed silicone rubber onto\na precured rubber, with a layer\nof silicone primer applied first.\nAlthough this has appeared to give a\nsatisfactory bond, a new investigation indicates that the bond strength\ncan be increased if the primer is\neliminated and the surface is lightly\nabraded.\nIn a test of this procedure, an\naluminum flatwise tensile block was\nprimed and silicone rubber was\napplied and allowed to cure at room\ntemperature for a minimum of 72\nhours. Silicone primer was then\napplied to the cured silicone rubber\nand to the surface of a matching\naluminum flatwise tensile block.\nFinally, freshly-prepared silicone\nrubber was applied to both surfaces\nof matching blocks . Test specimens\nwithout the primer between the\nrubber-te-rubber interface were\nfabricated by applying silicone\nrubber directly to the precured\nsurface.\nAs the Test I data in the table\nindicate, the unprimed specimens\nhad considerably higher bond\nstrengths than the primed specimens.

Houston. Texas\nThermal stress in high-temperature/hlgh-strength materials can\nbe substantially reduced by adding a\nmetallic outer layer that has high\nthermal conductivity. The layer\n(silver or copper, for example) is\ndeposited by standard plating\nprocesses. The technique can help\nto prevent structural overloading in\nturbine blades, heat exchangers,\npowerplant parts, and other applications where a combination of high\ntemperature and low conductivity\ncan cause large deflections and\nthermal stress. The layer is applied\neasily and is Inexpensive when\ncompared with other methods, such\nas adding a thermal-control system\nor increasing the thickness of the\nparts.\nThe effectiveness of the technique\nIs illustrated in the figure, which\nshows temperature-versus-time\ncurves measured for a heated\nsection of a wing panel for the Space\nShuttie Orbiter. The panel is fabricated from an iron/nickel-alloy\nhoneycomb that is closed out by\niron/nickel beams. During reentry,\nthese panels can experience a maximum heating rate of 3.8 BtU/ft2-s\n(1.03 cal/c~-s), which produces\ntemperatures near 1,3O<f F (704\xc2\xb0\nC). The conductivity of the alloy is\nrelatively low [12 Btu/h_oF-ft (0.004\ncal/s-\xc2\xb0C-cm)], and this causes a\nbuildup of localized hotspots.\nThe figure shows heating curves\nextracted from two temperature\nsensors; the dashed curve is for the\nuncoated panel, and the solid curve\nis for the panel coated with a silver\noverlay 10 mils (0 .025 cm) in thickness.

The\ngoal of the LVE monitoring program\nis to assess the applicability and\naccuracy of diffusion models for\npredicting the dispersion of exhaust\neffluents from current and future\nNASA launch vehicles. Early in the\nLVE program , it was determined that\ndetection techniques for HCI gas (a\nmajor exhaust product in most solid\nrocket motors) were inadequate.\nThis requirement for a highperformance HCI detector to monitor\nambient ai r concentrations led to\nwork on the development of suitable\nnew detectors. Nine techniques\nwere evaluated or developed, and\n\nNASA Tech Bri efs, W inter 1977\n\nthe results have been published in a\n_ regprt cile~:tattha.en~oUbls~rticla._ _\nThe techniques are briefly discussed\nbelow and are compared in the\naccompanying table.\nThe first three methods are fairly\nstandard and are frequently\nemployed for HCI dosage (ppm-s)\ndetection:\n5.\n1. Bubbler Method (a standard laboratory and field sampling technique for many gas species):\nHowever, HCI detection capability of the bubbler is only about\n50 ppm-s and is limited by the\nbackground chloride concentration of the bubbler solution .\n2. pH Measurements (based on the\nfact that HCI is hygroscopic and\nreadily forms an acid with water) :\nThese include standard lab techniques, such as the use of pH6.\nsensitive papers, pH electrodes,\nand the like. Such methods are\nlimited, with lower detection sensitivities of about 60 ppm-s o\n3. Indicator Tubes (available commercially for HCI detection and\ngenerally contain a granular material, typically a silica gel, impregnated with a substance that\nchanges color upon exposure to\nHCI): Silica gel indicator tubes\nare most suited for problem estimation , being capable of detecting 1 ppm over a 2- to 5-minute\nperiod. Other indicator tubes (not\navailable commercially) are\ncoated with various other substances that capture the HCI for\nlaboratory analysiS. These techniques have a lower detection\nlimit of about \'10 ppm-s o\nThese three standard techniques\nare all limited in accuracy and/or\nrequire laboratory analYSis. The\nfollowing six techniques are relatively newly developed, involve In\n7.\nsitu sampling , and require no lalx>ratory analysis to obtain HCI concentration or dosage data.\n4. Microcoulometers (a continuousmode technique where the incoming HCI bubbles through an\nelectrolyte) : Silver ions in the\nelectrolyte react with the HCI ,\nprecipitating AgCI and thus\nreducing the silver ion concen8.\ntration of the electrolyte . The\n\nconsequent generation of replacementsil\xc2\xa5er ionS-at-gener- - ating electrodes can be accurately related to the quantity of\nHCI introduced to the system.\nThis method is operational and\nhas a lower detection limit of\nabout 0.08 ppm.\n\nModified Condensation Nuclei\nCounter (HCI is converted to\nNH,cC1 by passing the air sample\nover a solution of NHPH): The\nNH,cC1 particles are detected by a\nconventional condensation nuclei\ncounter and are related by calibration to the HCI concentration .\nThe instrument, existing as a\nbreadboard unit, has some patential for detecting as low as 1 to\n2 ppm with a response time of a\nfew seconds.\nDual-Isotope Infrared Absorption\n(nondispersive infrared analysis) :\nAn IR beam is passed alternately\nthrough a cell containing HCI3s\nand one containing HC137. Each\ncell filters out the wavelengths\nabsorbed by its molecule. The\nfiltered/ chopped beam is passed\nthrough the sample cell, where\nthe nonfiltered wavelengths are\nabsorbed in an amount dependent on the ambient HCI isotope\nconcentrations and on other\nfactors (cell constants, temperature, and so forth) that are the\nsame for each beam . Since ambient HCI contains a known and\nconstant ratio of the two isotopes,\nthe at1enuation of the two beams\ncan be electronically processed\nto produce a readout signal proportional to HCI concentration.\nThis detector currently exists as\na breadboard unit capable of detecting 0.3 ppm HCI in 8 seconds\nto 90 percent of reading .\nGas-Filter Correlation (a modification of the nondisperslve infrared analyzer): An open-cell gasfilter correlation instrument that\nis designed to operate onboard\nan aircraft has been constructed\nand is being tested. It has a\nlower detection limit of about 5\nppm with a response time of 10\nseconds to 90 percent of reading.\nChemiluminescent Nitric Oxide\nDetection (the reaction of HCI\n\ngas with NH 3and the conversion\noUile remaining NH-y-to-NO): The\nNO is then measured, using a\nconventional chemiluminescent\nNO detector, and the measurement of NO is related by calibration to the concentration of HCI\nin the sample . The breadboard\nunit has a lower detection limit of\n1 to 2 ppm with a response time\nof a few seconds to 90 percent of\nreading .\n\n9. Chemlluminescent LuminolOxidation Detection (based on a\nchemiluminescent reaction in\nwhich visible light is generated in\nan alkaline solution of luminol\nduring oxidation by HP~: The\nvisible light is monitored by a\nphotomultiplier tube and is proportional to the HCI concentration of the airstream. The\nalumina tube that conducts\nsample gas to the reaction cell is\ncoated with NaBrO) and NaBr.\nThis coating reacts with the HCI\nto produce a series of bromine/\nchlorine compounds that catalyze the luminol oxidation. This\ndetector is commercially available and has a lower detection\nlimit of about 0.05 ppm with a\nresponse of 1 to 20 seconds.\nSunvnary of Meeaurement Methods\nMethod\n(See\nText)\n\nHCI\nConc.\nMeas.\n\nLower\nDet.\nUm.\n(ppm)\n\nTime\nt090% of\nReading\n(Seconds)\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\'50\n\'60\n\'10\n0.08\n1 to 2\n0.3\n5\n1 to 2\n<0.05\n\n-\n\n>60\n<5\n8\n<10\n<5\n1 to 20\n\n\'(ppm-s)\n\nComplete data on specificity and\ninterference by other species are not\nyet available.

One such steel , 18-3 Mn\n(Nitronic 33) stainless contains\napproximately 18 percent chromium ,\n3.5 percent nickel , 0.05 percent\ncarbon , 13.5 percent manganese,\nand 0.3 percent nitrogen .

Included in the study were\nthe ambient and liquid hydrogen\ntemperature (20.5 K) tensile properties and the ambient stresscorrosion resistance of annealedparent and tungsten/inert-gas (TIG)\nwelded specimens .\nTensile tests on longitudinal and\ntransverse specimens of both parent\nand welded specimens indicated\nexcellent mechanical properties at\ntest temperatures down to -2000 F\n(144.26 K). At lower temperatures ,\nthe elongation rapidly decreased to\nless than 6.0 percent at liquid\nhydrogen temperature . The notched\ntensile properties of the longitudinal\nand transverse parent-metal specimens indicated a progressive\nincrease in notched tensile strength\n(NTS) from ambient to liquid nitrogen temperature.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nMany widely separated parties\ncan be linked into an efficient communications network by a versatile\nnew control terminal , shown in the\nfigure . The terminal can handle\nvoice and data communications via\nboth telephone lines and radiofrequency channels. It includes\ntelephone-to-radio "patch ," a telephone autodialer, and other\nadvanced features to provide rapid\ncommunications for applications\nsuch as emergency medical\nservices (EMS) operations . The\nsystem combines commercially\navailable subassemblies into an\nattractive package that is easily\noperated by nontechnical personnel .\nA prototype of the terminal has\nbeen used for several months at the\nOdessa, Texas , Medical Center to\nassist in EMS operations . The\nprototype controls three radio\nchannels and three telephone lines.\nIt includes a 32-number telephone\nautodialer and the telephone-toradio patch .\nThe radio channels may be any\nfrequency in the VHF or UHF range .\nSignals are transmitted through\nthree remote unmanned radiofrequency base stations. Communications between the terminal and\nthe base stations are along dedicated telephone lines. One channel is\nreserved for EKG transmissions ; a\nsecond handles hospital to hospital\nand ambulance to hospital communications in the region serviced by\nthe EMS; and the third is a local\nambulance to hospital communications channel that uses a locally\naSSigned frequency.\nA subaudible tone is automatically\nsent from the ambulance when\ntransmitting to the hospital over the\nlocal channel .

The terminal also\nhas an auxiliary control unit that allows personnel to radio/transmit via\nthe station from a remote location.

The muting\nsystem can be overridden in special\nsituations (such as a disaster) so\nthat all parties transmitting at the\ndeSignated local frequency can be\nheard at the control unit.\nFor the regional channel , each\nhospital has a three-digit address\nthat is dialed to contact that\nhospital . By using the three-digit\ncode , the operator can contact other\nhospitals equipped with similar\nterminals . Also, each ambulance is\nequipped with a tone-code dialer to\ncontact the regional hospitals via\nthis channel .\nThe telephone circuits are standard , commercially available items .\nOne line is a " hotline " to an\nemergency dispatch center (911\nnetwork) ; a second is an incoming\nEKG line that can interface with a\ncardioscope and strip-chart\nrecorder; and the third is a programable telephone dialer that\n\nstores up to 32 numbers (to specialcare centers , poison-control\ncenters , a blood bank , and other\nservices) . The console operator\ninitiates communications to one of\nthese centers without dialing , simply\nby preSSing a button .\nAll terminal functions are clearly\nmarked and accessible on the front\nof the console . Three speakers are\nmounted for receipt of the radio\ncommunications . Each has an\nindicating light that flashes when the\ncorresponding channel is activated\nby an incoming call . When this\nSignal is received , the operator\nrotates the select switch to engage\nin two-way communications on that\nchannel .\nThis work was done by Norman\nBelasco, Sam L. Pool, and Richard\nL.

Should a fluid, for example,\ncontain a nutrient that becomes\ngummy and sticky when heated (as\noccurred in one of the Viking spacecraft biological instruments), the residue of the nutrient will lodge within\nthe plunger cavity and hinder or prevent the proper functioning of the\nvalve.\nA proposed valve assembly\n(shown in the diagram) keeps the\nnutrient out of the moving parts of\nthe valve by physically isolating the\nplunger from the fluid . The poppet\nand the diaphragm are molded together, and the latter is shaped to\nact as a static seal, which remains\nseated during the valve operation.\nAs the plunger moves, the diaphragm also moves to form a separate cavity for the nutrient and\nthus isolates it from the plunger\ncavity and the latching mechanism.\nWhen the plunger changes direction , the diaphragm returns to its atrest pOSition, and the nutrient is expelled through the outlet ports into a\nmanifold, a line, or a reservoir.\nThe diaphragm/poppet combination functions as a mechanical lock\nas well ; this results in a positive\nseating and unseating action of the\n\nCOIL ASSEMBLY\n\nPIN\n\nSEAT SEALING\nSURFACE\n\nDIAPHRAGM (MOLDED\nINTEGRALLY WITH\nPOPPET) INCORPORATING\nSTATIC SEAL AND SEAT\nSEAL\n\nIn the Miniature Diaphragm Valve, the poppet and diaphragm are\nmolded together.

In such systems, however, it\nis not uncommon for significant\nerrors to be caused by distortion\nintroduced by the image intensifier\nelectro-optics and by skew due to\nmisorientation of the image intensifier with respect to the X-ray source.\nGreater accuracy in making calculations from resultant images can\nbe obtained with a detachable alinement gage that shows the amount\nand direction of skew. The alinement\ntool, as shown in the photograph ,\nconsists of an upper plate and a\n\nlower plate separated by an aluminum post. Both plates are grooved in\na pattern of concentric rings and\ncoordinate lines. The gage is\nmounted on the face of the image\nintensifier. Skew is corrected by\nviewing the gage on the video\nmonitor and adjusting the imageintensifier position and tilt angle .

Pulsecode modulation (PCM) , is used\nfor a high-qual ity signal , and lowpower CMOS integrated circuits\nmake miniaturization possible. The\ntransmitter is useful for electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrocardiograms (EKG) and other biomedical patient-monitoring\nsituations .\nA block diagram of the part of the\ntelemetry system that is carried by\nthe unrestrained subject is shown in\nFigure 1. (The receiver and demodulator that recover the analog data\nare powerline operated and are not\nminiaturized .) The system is configured with eight low-noise preamplifiers for multichannel EEG\napplications or EKG with reduced\namplifier gains. Of course , any\ntransducer (such as pressure, blood\nflow, respiration , oxygen consumption , or dimension) that has a suitable signal conditioner to provide an\nanalog output in the \xc2\xb11 .O-V range\ncan be connected to the multiplexer.\nAfter time multiplexing the resultant composite analog signal is converted to a pulse-width-modulation\n(PWM) format , as seen in the typical\nwaveforms of Figure 2. The analog\nsignal is converted to PWM by inputting it and a ramp function to a comparator amplifier . The sample\ninterval is approximately 100 J.I s per\nchannel , which results in a frame\nrepetition rate of 1,OOO/s (eight\nchannels plus one zero reference\nand one frame sync interval).\nThe PWM signal is converted to\npulse-code modulation (PCM) by\ngating a 5-MHz oscillator on and off\nwith the PWM signal and counting\nthe number of 5-MHz cycles. The\ncounted cycles at the end of each\nword are parallel shifted to a shift\nregister, and the counter is reset to\nzero, ready to accept the next word.\nWhile the next word is being\ncounted , the previous word is serial\n500\n\n8 DATA\nAMPLIFIERS\n\nCLOCK\n\n8 DATA\nINPUTS\n\nFigure 1.

However, the effectiveness of\nthese methods differs Significantly\nwhen certain combinations of\nelements are examined.\nThe attenuation of X-rays is determined largely by the electron density\nof the material; thicker and denser\nmaterials appear more opaque. The\nmass attenuation coefficient for\nN-rays is a function of both the\nscattering and capture probabilities\nfor each element; thus the density or\nthickness of a material is less\nimportant in determining its transparency to neutrons.\nThe mass attenuation coefficients\nof different elements for X-rays\npresent a nearly linear increase with\nincreasing atomic number. In contrast, the (thermal) neutron attenuation coefficients show no such proportionality. High attenuation coefficients are exhibited by elements\nscattered throughout the periodic\ntable. Hydrogen, boron, cadmium ,\nand gadolinium with atomic numbers\nof 1, 5, 48, and 64, respectively all\nhave exceptionally large coefficients. (Hydrogen has the highest\nscattering probability, while the\nother three have high neutroncapture probabilities .)\nFor the case of hydrogen in\ntitanium, as an example, the\ntitanium neutron attenuation coefficient is only 0.2 percent that of\nhydrogen; the titanium X-ray absorption coefficient is 79 percent, or\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1977\n\nREACTOR\n\nREACTOR\n(a)\n\nCASSETTE\n\nINTENSIFER\nTUBE\n\n(b)\n\nMONITOR\n\nNeutrons Are Transmitted through an object to probe its inhomogene-\n\nties.

The system is considerably\nsimpler to use than helium leak\ndetectors and allows rapid leak\nchecks to be made as part of routine\nmaintenance.\n\nWhen helium leak detectors are\nused, the tester must bleed helium\ngas into the system from one side of\nthe leak and attach the detection\nsystem, usually a mass spectrometer, to the other side. Besides\nbeing tedious, this method is not\napplicable to welded lines since the\ninner wallis inaccessible. In addition, the helium may be incompatible with the "getters" used to\nprevent contamination.\nTwo forms of the ultrasonic\ndetector have been developed. The\nfirst (Figure 2a) picks up the\nturbulent-jet signal with an ultrasonic microphone and mixes it with\na local oscillator signal to generate\nan audible frequency. The audio\nsignal is amplified and used to drive\na speaker. This method can detect\nleaks through holes as small as\n0.007 in. (0.018 cm) and requires no\ndirect coupling to the fluid line.

Thus , the equipment\ntemperature is maintained closely,\nindependent of variations in the sink\nenvironment.\nWhen water is used as the\nworking fluid, the vapor-modulated\nheat pipe is limited to applications in\nwhich the water will not freeze .\nHowever, methanol and ammonia\ncan be used as well as water.\nIn a heat pipe that uses ammonia\n(see figure) , a variable-conductance\nsection approximately 10 inches (25\ncm) long and 1 inch (2 .5 cm) in\ndiameter connects two conventional\nheat pipes . When the valve is fully\nopen , liquid is evaporated from the\nexternally grooved surface of the\nevaporator heat pipe . The vapor\nflows through the valve and condenses on the externally grooved\nsurface of the condenser heat pipe.\nThus , with the valve fully open , the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , W inter 1977\n\ntwo conventional heat pipes are\ncoupled with a small temperature\ndifference between them .\nWhen the heat sink is colder than\nthe source , the heat-pipe system\ncauses the source temperature to\nfall until it reaches a set point. At\nAt this point , liquid in the sensor\nvolume, which is thermally coupled\nto the source, contracts and closes\nthe valve. The vapor is throttled , and\nthe pressure buildup on the evaporator side of the bulkhead exceeds\nthe capillary-pressure limit of the\ngrooves and wick . As a result, the\nliquid flows out of them to the other\nside of the bulkhead . The evaporator\nside dries out, and a large temperature difference is incurred between\nthe condenser and evaporator heat\npipes . The pressure buildup is large\nenough to " blow through " the\ncapillary barrier consisting of a few\nlayers of fine-mesh screen that\nseparates the wicks at the bulkhead .\nBlowthrough does not affect performance because by the time it\noccurs , the wick structure on the\nevaporator side is dried out. The\ncapillary barrier reestablishes isolation before the pressure difference is\n\nlow enough to allow the wick to\nrewet.\nWith the valve closed then . the\noverall conductance of the system is\nlow, and the heat source increases\nin temperature. When it rises above\nthe set point, liquid in the sensor\nvolume expands , and the valve\nopens . With the pressure relieved ,\nthe wick and grooves become wet\nagain , and high conductance\nbetween the source and sink is\nreestablished . The source then\nbegins to cool , and the cycle\nrepeats. In steady state , the valve\ncloses just enough to produce a\npartial dryout that achieves the\nrequired temperature drop.\nThis work was done by Donald K.\nEdwards, James E. Eninger, and\nEdward E.

It has an aluminum panel\ncontaining variable-conductance\nheat pipes that can be coupled to\neither a fluid header or a flexible\nheat-pipe header that is capable of\ntransporting 850 watts in a 900 bent\nconfiguration .\nAs shown in the figure, the radiator consists of four detachable\npieces of hardware: a heat-pipe\npanel , a flexible heat-pipe header, a\nheat exchanger, and a fluid header.\nThe panel contains six L-shaped\nlongitudinally-grooved aluminum\nheat pipes ; the long condenser leg is\nadhesively bonded to the panel, and\nthe short evaporator leg is clamped\nto the fluid or heat-pipe header.\nFlats across the pipes are the\nthermal-contact interface for the\nclamped connections to the header.\nThe area of control is increased by\njogging the evaporator section in the\nmiddle so that two consecutive\nevaporator sections can be clamped\nside by side on the header. Stainless-steel reservoirs are welded to\neach pipe through an aluminum/\nstainless-steel transition piece .\nValved charge tubes are used in\nplace of a permanent seal to allow\nsingle-fluid or variable-conductance\nheat-pipe (VCHP) operation .\nThe flexible heat-pipe header consists of an evaporator section (an\naluminum tube), a flexible transport\nsection (a stainless-steel bellows\nhose assembly overwrapped with\nwire braid and designed for a 900\ninside bend radius), a condenser\nsection (a thick-walled aluminum\ntube), and a stainless-steel reservoi r\nwelded to the condenser.\n\n514\n\nPANEL\nHEAT\nEXCHANGER\n(CLAMPED TO\nEVAPORATOR\nOF HEAT PIPE\nHEADER)\n\nCLAMPS\n(TYP.)\n\nFLEXIBLE\nHEAT-PIPE\nHEADER\nFLEXIBLE\nSECTION\nFREON-21\nOUTLET\nFREON-21\nINLET\n\nA Deployable Heat-Pipe Radiator has four separate pieces of hardware:\na heat-pipe panel, a flexible heat-pipe header, a heat exchanger, and a\nfluid header. ~ingle-fluid transport capacities of about 850 watts,\ncorresponding to 51,000 watt-inches, have been achieved in a 90" bend\norientation of the heat-pipe header.\nThe heat exchanger is a two-piece\naluminum clamshell deSign that\nclamps over the circular evaporator.\nThe heat-exchanger effectiveness\nbetween Freon 21 (or equivalent),\nwhich flows through an annular\nsection , and ammonia vapor in the\nheader has been estimated at over\n80 percent.\nThe fluid header is made of aluminum and clamps di rectly to the six\nevaporators of the panel feeder\n\npipes.

The formula\nwas the result of a study to determine the complete theoretical solution of the isothermal elastohydrodynamic lubrication of fully-flooded\nand starved elliptical contacts . It\nwas not until recently that the\ninfluence of lubricant starvation\nupon elastohydrodynamic behavior\nreceived serious consideration .\nPrior to this time, it was assumed\nthat the inlets were fully flooded .\nMaintaining a fluid film of adequate\nthickness is extremely important to\nthe operation of machine elements .\nThe film thickness in a starved conjunction is less than that of a fully\nflooded conjunction. This means\nthat starved conjunctions have\ninc.reased wear and decreased\nfatigue lives when compared to fully\nflooded conjunctions .\nThe formula is based on the computed area in and around the\nHertzian contact.

A fully\nflooded condition is said to exist\nwhen the dimensionless inlet\ndistance ceases to influence in any\nSignificant way the minimum film\nthickness. When starting from a fully\nflooded condition and decreasing m,\nthe value at which the minimum film\nthickness first starts to change is\ncalled the fully flooded/starved\nboundary and is denoted by m* .\nTherefore, lubricant starvation was\nstudied by using the elastohydrodynamic lubrication point-contact\ntheory and observing the effect of\nreducing the dimensionless inlet\ndistance.\nThe expression for the fully\nflooded/starved boundary can be\nwritten as shown in Figure 2.\n\nA fully flooded condition exists when\nm ~ m* , and a starved condition\nexists when m <m* .\nHaving fully established the limiting location of the inlet boundary for\nthe fully flooded condition, the\nequation defining the dimensionless .\nfilm thickness for lubricant starvation conditions can be written as\nshown in equation (8) in Figure 2 on\nthe next page .\nTherefore , whenever m <m* ,\nwhere m* is defined by equation (1)\nin Figure 2, a lubricant starvation\ncondition exists, and the dimensionless minimum film thickness should\nbe expressed by equation (8) in the\ntext .

The program optimizes static strength and scales up\nto satiSfy fatigue and fracture\ncriteria. It has multimaterial capability and a library of materials properties, including advanced composites. APAS III can be used to evaluate the impact on the weight of variables such as materials, types of\nconstruction, structural configurations, minimum gage limits, applied\nloads, fatigue lives, crack-growth\nlives , initial crack sizes, and residual\nstrengths .\nUp to six external static-strength\nloading conditions can be Input.\nEach condition consists of a set of 3\nforces and 3 moments for up to 20\nstations along the structure . Any\nconvenient reference axes may be\nadopted . Internal computations\nautomatically transfer the loads to\nthe section elastic axis .

Shear and bending stresses\nare found by assuming that plane\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Wlnter1977\n\nsections remain plane . Torsional\nmoment and direct shear can have\nprescribed distributions.\nThe geometry is defined by discrete nodes on the contour of the\nsurface.

The allowable\nstresses for static strength are calculated , using buckling , crippling,\nand net-tension analyses. The allowable stresses for the fatigue, crackgrowth, and residual-strength\ncriteria are calculated , using\nMiner\'s analysis and fracture\nmechanics. The stress spectra for\nthese analyses are generated at\neach analysis station , using the\nflight profile for a medium-range,\nlarge, commercial transport .\nThe optimization procedure for\nstatic strength is a two-step process\nthat proceeds systematically from\n\none rib or frame location to another.\nIn the first step of the synthesis\nprocess, initial sizes of structural\nmembers are adjusted iteratively\nuntil each element has a zero\nmargin of safety for at least one\nloading condition or until a\nminimum-gage constraint is encountered . In the second step, the\nmargins of safety are maximized by\nchanging element geometry and\nholding structural weight constant.\nUSing the new deSign as the initial\ndeSign, the two steps are repeated\nuntil the design converges .\nThis optimized deSign is then successively checked for the fatigue,\ncraCk-growth , and residual-strength\ncriteria. If any criterion is not met,\nthe structure is scaled up in size,\nand a new pass is made through the\nstatic-strength, fatigue , crackgrowth, and reSidual-strength\nanalyses . This procedure is repeated until all criteria are met.\nA Fletcher, Powell, Davidon technique is used to maximize the\nmargin of safety, rather than to\nminimize the weight, to allow\nconstrained-function optimization\nmethods to be used.

Written for the analysis of\npowered or unpowered vehicles\noperation near a rotating oblate\nplanet, typical applications of POST\n(6 OOF) include:\n-Guidance and flight-control system\nSimulation and analysis ,\n-Loads and dispersion-type analysis,\n-General-purpose six-degrees-offreedom simulation of controlled\nand uncontrolled vehicles, and\n-Six-degrees-of-freedom performance validation .\nPOST (6 DOF) features a NAMELIST-type input feature that significantly reduces input deck setup time\n(and cost) ; it is readily used by\ntrajectory engineers without specialized training in such areas as systems programing and optimization\ntheory. This program is also capable\nof using general-purpose discrete. parameter targeting and optimization to solve a broad spectrum of\nproblems related to the impact of the\ncontrol system design on the performance characteristics of aerospace\nvehicles.\nThe basic simulation flexibility is\nachieved by decomposing the trajectory into a logical sequence of\nsimulation segments . These trajectory segments , referred to as\nphases , enable the trajectory\nanalyst to model both the physical\nand the nonphysical aspects of the\nsimulation accurately and efficiently. By segmenting the mission\ninto phases , each phase can be\nmodeled and simulated in the\nmanner most appropriate to that\nparticular fIi]ht regime . For\nexample , the planet model , the\nvehicle model , and the simulation\noptions can be changed in any\nphase to be compatible with the\nlevel of detail required in that phase .\nEvery computational routine in the\nprogram can be categorized according to five basic functional elements :\nthe planet model , the vehicle model ,\nthe trajectory simulation model , the\nauxiliary calculations module, and\nthe targeting and optimization\nmodule . The planet model\ncomprises an oblate spheroid\nmodel , a gravitational model , an\natmosphere model , and a winds\nmodel. These models define the\nNASA Tech Briefs , W in ter 1977\n\nenvironment in which the vehicle\noperates. The vehicle model comprises mass properties, propulsion,\naerodynamics and aeroheating, an\nairframe model, a navigation and\nguidance model, and a flight-control\nsystem model. These models define\nthe basic vehicle simulation characteristics.\nThe trajectory simulation models\nare the event-sequencing module\nthat controls the program cycling,\ntable interpolation routines, and\nseveral standard numerical-integration techniques . These models are\nused in numerically solving the\ntranslational and rotational equations of motion. The auxiliary calculations module provides for a wide\nvariety of output calculations. For\nexample, conic parameters and\nrange calculations are among the\nmany output variables computed.\nThe targeting and optimization\nmodule provides a general discreteparameter iteration capability. The\nuser can select the optimization\nvariable, the dependent variable,\nand the independent variables from\na list of more than 400 program\nvariables. An accelerated projected\ngradient algorithm is used as the\nbasic optimization technique. This\nalgorithm is a combination of\nRosen\'s projection method for\nnonlinear programing and Oavidon\'s\nvariable metric method for unconstrained optimization. In the targeting mode, the minimum norm\nalgorithm is used to satisfy the\ntrajectory constraints. The cost and\nconstraint gradients required by\nthese algorithms are computed as\nfirst differences calculated from\nperturbed trajectories . To reduce\nthe costs of calculating numerical\nsensitivities, only that portion of the\ntrajectory influenced by any\nparticular independent variable is\nreintegrated on the perturbed runs .\nThis feature saves a significant\namount of computer time when\ntargeting and optimization are\nperformed .\nPOST (6 OOF) is written in\nFORTRAN IV and has been implemented on a CDC 5000-series\ncomputer with a central memory\nrequirement of approximately 107K\n(octal) of 50-bit words .

The term transonic refers\nto ai rcraft speeds less than the\nspeed of sound but close enough so\nthat on the top of the wing , where\nairflow is the fastest, the mach\nnumber becomes greater than 1.\nFor aircraft designed to fly near the\nspeed of sound, it is desirable that\nthese supercritical wing sections be\ndesigned such that the transonic\nflow is shockless or that the shock\nwave be as weak as possible . This\nprogram should be of aid in the\ndesign phase of a new airfoil and in\nthe analysis of existing airfoils.\nThe program was first developed\nfor off-design analysis of supercritical airfoils, but it can be used as\na stand-alone program to analyze\nthe flow field about any airfoil. It\ncalculates weak solutions of equations of motion that include one or\nmore isentropic shocks. The flow\nequations, including a semiempirical\nturbulent boundary-layer correction,\nare solved by a rotated finitedifference scheme in a more-or-Iess\narbitrary curvilinear-coordinate\nsystem. This allows the prediction of\nshock waves as far back on the airfoil as desired. Inputs are the airfoil\ngeometry (coordinates) and one or\nmore sets of prescribed mach\nnumbers and angles of attack.\nOutputs are the flow field about the\nairfoil.\nThe program has yielded results\nthat agree very well with experimentally obtained data. Recently the\nanalysis results have been compared to schlieren photographs with .\n\nvery suitable agreement. The pro-gram provides numerical and plotted\noutput for further proceSSing.\nThis program is written in\nFORTRAN IV for the CDC 6000series computer and has a core\nrequi rement of approximately 113K\n(octal) 50-bit words . The program\ncan use a tape drive to stop and later\nrestart a flow calculation. If plotted\noutput is requested, a CALCOMP\nPlotter is required. Experimental\ndata can be included on the\npressure distribution plot for\ncomparison with the theoretical\nresults.\nThis program was written by\nFrances Bauer, Paul Garabedian,\nAnthony Jameson, and David Korn\nof New York University for Langley\nResearch Center.

The\nprograms are easily used for design\nand analysis and include constraints\non linear theory methods to provide\nphysical realism. The package\nshould prove useful for any type of\nsupersonic configu ration.\nThe integrated system consists of\nan executive "driver" and seven\nbasic computer programs including\na geometry input module. The individual modules provide data for configuration design or analysis. Skin\nfriction is computed using turbulent\nflat-plate theory. Wave drag is\ncalculated with either far-field\n(supersonic area rule) or near-field\n(surface pressure integration)\nmethods. The far-field method is\n(continued next page)\n\n521\n\n0\n\nused for wave-drag coefficient calculations and for fuselage optimization according to area-rule\nconcepts .\nThe near-field method is used\nprimarily as an analysis tool where\ndetailed pressure distributions are of\ninterest. Lifting pressure , drag due\nto lift, pitching moment, and trim\ndrag are computed from the lift\nanalysis program , which breaks\narbitrary wing/fuselage/ canard/\nnacelles/horizontal-tail configurations into a mosaic of "Mach-box"\nrectil inear elements that are\nemployed in linear theory solutions .\nA complementary wing-design and\noptimization program solves for the\nwing shape required to support an\noptimized pressure distribution at a\nspecified flight condition .\nA geometry module handles all\nconfiguration geometry for the\nsystem . All "paneling " of the configuration for theoretical analyses is\naccomplished within the programs,\nand the user prepares only\n" drawing-type" geometry specifications for input. A plot module\ndraws configuration pictures\naccording to size and view requests.\nThus the basis of the system is\nsupersonic linearized theory, modified with the "Whitham" correctionto-disturbance positioning being\nused in the propagation of body\npressure fields , an optional limitingpressure feature to control the\npermissible level of upper-surface\npressure coefficient, and a constraint to limit the upper-surface\nstreamwise pressure gradient.\nThe entire design and analYSis\nsystem is a single overlaid program .\nThe executive level of the system\ncontrols module execution by means\nof special identification cards in the\ninput data . Data in the system are\ntransferred between modules by disk\nstorage and common blocks . The\nsystem was developed with an interactive graphic capability, but this\nability was developed specific to the\nNASA Langley Research Center CRT\ndisplay system and its associated\nsoftware . This part of the system is\nconsidered inoperative in the\ndistributed code because of the lack\nof supporting software .\nA user may be able to revive the\ninteractive graphics segment if they\n522\n\nalready have existing interactive\ngraphics capabilities . The program\nalso provides offline plotting abilities\nthat require a Calcomp plotter. The\nLangley Research Center graphic\nlibrary routines are provided in\nrelocatable form as a plot library.\nThis program is written in\nFORTRAN and has been implemented on the CDC 6000-series\ncomputer with a central memory\nrequirement of approximately 77K\noctal of 6O-bit words .\nThis program was written by R.

These\ncomputations are useful in efforts to\nimplement boundary-layer suction\non a wing to maintain laminar flow in\norder to reduce net drag. Based on\nthe current state of the art for\nboundary-layer computations for\nfinite swept wings and that for transition estimates, a rigorous computation would be complex and difficult\nto use. Hence, STAY LAM contains a\nnumber of approximations to\nsimplify the analysis; yet the results\nare accurate enough to be useful ,\nparticularly in the preliminary deSign\nphase.\nSTAYLAM is based on a previous\nprogram for the calculation of the\nincompressible laminar boundary\nlayer and prediction of transition on\nan infinite sheared wing . It includes\ndistributed wall suction and compressibility effects. To allow for discontinuous changes in the suction\ndistribution , the boundary layer is\ncomputed by using a first-order\n\naccurate finite-difference scheme in\nthe streamwise marching variable .\nThe Stewartson transformation is\nused to account for compressibility\neffects. The Prandtl number is\nassumed to be unity, and the total\ntemperature is assumed to be the\nsame as the free-stream value. A\nfurther approximation in the treatment of the streamwise pressure\ngradient term allows the incompressible, infinite, swept-wing equations to be obtained after the\nStewartson transformation . This\nlatter approximation restricts the use\nof STAYLAM to speeds in the transonic range or less.\nThe boundary-layer results are\nanalyzed to determine whether\nleading-edge instability or crossflow\ninstability occurs . The Owen-Randall\ncriterion is used for the crossflow\ninstability test. The TollmienSchlichting instability is estimated by\nusing a correlation of the critical\nReynolds number as a function of\nthe external pressure gradient. The\npoint where transition is completed\nis estimated by the Granville correlation . Input quantities to these tests\nare the actual compressible values,\nnot the incompressible values given\nby the Stewartson transformation.\nInput to the program includes\ngeometric description of the airfoil ,\nfree-stream information, compressibility parameters , and various parameters controlling the numerical\ntechniques used in the program.\nOutput includes displacement and\nmomentum thickness, skin-friction\nvalues , and results of the transition\nestimates at each location on the\nairfoil where a boundary-layer\ncalculation is made.\nThis program is written in\nFORTRAN IV and has been implemented on a CDC SOOO-series\ncomputer with a central memory\nrequirement of approximately 24K\n(octal) of SO-bit words.\nThis program was written by\nJames E.

The beam is locked by applying tension to the cables. During stowage the segmented longerons collapse to lie adjacent to each other.\nAn articulated beam that\nbecomes a rigid triangular truss\nwhen deployed, is stored by folding\nit flat as it is heliced about a cylinder.\nThe t:>eam, shown in its deployed,\npartially stowed, and fully stowed\nconfigurations, is composed of longerons, diagonals, and scissors\narms.\nOn one side of the beam the longerons are hinged; on the opposite\nside they are segmented and have\ncables reeved through them.

This produces a flat envelope\nthat allows more beams to be\nstowed on the cylinder than would\nbe possible if the beams did not fold\nflat.\nThe beam is deployed by retracting the cables until the segmented\nlongerons are pulled together.

The object is to rotate the load\nfrom one rest position to the next as\nquickly as possible - and that\n\nmeans high acceleration and deceleration of a heavy load .\nThe digital/analog control ci rcuit\nshown in Figure 1 provides the controlled high torque/high damping\nneeded .

Waveforms illustrate the principle of the damping method.\nFull excitation on winding 1 accelerates the load until it reaches set\npoint P; then reverse excitation on winding 2 decelerates the motor\nquickly for a short period. When the speed drops below a predetermined\nthreshold, proportional damping (both windings energized) brings the\nload to a smooth stop.\n526\n\neter determines when currents\nshould be applied to the motor\nwindings to index precisely with a\npredetermined position . The method\nrequires no brushes, can turn the\nstepper clockwise or counterclockwise, and automatically compensates turning and damping for load\nvariations . This type of circuit could\nbe used in scanning instruments ,\nantenna drives , numericallycontrolled machine tools , film\ndrives , x-y plotters , computer\nperipheral eqUipment , and other\nstop-and-go applications .\nA step starts with the motor and\nload at rest . Full current is applied to\none of the two motor windings and\naccelerates the shaft and load\ntoward the new rest position , which\nis 90 electrical degrees from the\ninitial position (Figure 2) . At a preselected angular position , P, before\nthe final position , the first winding is\ndeenergized , and full reverse\ncurrent is applied to the second\nwinding , decelerating the load until\nthe angular speed (measured by the\ntachometer) drops to a predetermined threshold . At this point , R,\nwinding 1 is reenergized, and\nwinding 2 is allowed to come out of\nsaturation . Winding 2 thus damps\nessentially proportionally, stopping\nthe shaft at the new position .\nWhether a load is heavy or light ,\nthe desired damping can be\nobtained by adjusting the c ircuit\ngain.\nIn operation , the motor step is\ninitiated by a 50-millisecond clock\npulse applied to a stepper waveform\ngenerator (Figure 1) . (The clock\npulse duration is long enough for the\nstep to be completed and fully\ndamped .)\nThe stepper waveform generator\nsends a short sequence of pulses to\ninstruct a control logic circuit to\nperform its function - that is, to\nselect the proper windings and\ndirections of excitation to drive and\ndamp the motor.

In conventional valves, the\npoppet and seat are normally\nmounted in line with the flow stream.\nDuring the closing cycle, the flow is\nabruptly stopped, and contaminants\ncan adhere to the surfaces adjacent\nto the seal. When the poppet moves\naway from the seat, the adhering\npart,icles tend to be attracted onto\nthe sealing surfaces. These particles\ncan cause leakage after only a few\ncycles.\nIn the design shown in the figure,\ncontaminants in the flow stream are\nremoved before they reach the sealing surfaces by altering the direction\nof the flow several times before it\nenters the poppet-and-seat flow passage. Particles are separated and\nare deposited on surfaces not affecting sealing performance.\nThe valve has a metallic spherical\nseat and a nonmetallic poppet in a\nmetallic enclosure. To eliminate excessive wear due to parts misalineme nt, the poppet swivels on the\nspherical surface of the seat. The\npoppet guide is provided with ample\nlateral clearance, allowing it to float\nand to seek its center on the seat\nduring the closing cycle.\nThe poppet is made of a polyimide\nthat can withstand high compressive\nloads and remains dimensionally\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1977\n\nOUTLET\nFLOW\n\nINLET FLOW\n\nSelf\xc2\xb7Alining Poppet\xc2\xb7and\xc2\xb7Seat Combination is designed with several\nchanges in direction in the inlet flow path to trap contaminants before\nthey settle on the active seal area.

Floating Nut Assembly uses a pair of shoulder screws to lock\nthe nut while allowing some float. The main connection is to a\nback-mounted screw that passes through an oversized hole in the\nmounting flange attached to the equipment housing.\n\nA novel floating nut can hold an\nassembly in place even if the mounting screw becomes loose. This nut is\nuseful for all types of mechanical\nand electronic assemblies in which\naccumulated tolerances can add up\nto a sloppy fit at the chassis side of\nthe equipment. In the case of stacks\nof electronic assemblies , for\ninstance, individual mounting-hole\ntolerances can add and subtract so\nthat screw-mounting them to a less\nflexible structure (e .g ., a cabinet or\nhoneycomb deck) requires the\nfloating nut.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the main\nstructural connection is made with a\nback-mounted screw that passes\nthrough an oversized hole in the\nmounting flange attached to the\n\n528\n\nSHOULDER\nSCREW\n\nequipment housing . The nut is rectangular , ana is slotted to accommodate a pair of shoulder screws as\nshown in Figures 1 and 2. Each of\nthese screws has two shoulders one to rest on the top of the rectangular nut, and the other to slide in a\ngroove cut into the bottom of the\nnut . The threaded portion of the\nshoulder screw enters the mounting\nflange on the equipment housing .\nThus , while the mounting screw is\nrelatively inflexible, the floating nut\nthat secures the equipment to it, via\nthe mounting flange , can be moved\nlaterally to accommodate the accumulated tolerances . Furthermore , if\nfor some reason the mounting screw\nshould become loose , the shoulder\nscrews will keep the nut assembly in\nplace because the rectangular nut\ncannot turn any further than the\nbottom shoulders allow it. In fact ,\nthe nut will tend to lock onto the\nbottom shoulders .\nTo facilitate further a reliable connection, the nut and screws can be\npainted with a bonding agent to\ninsure a lock . If the assemblies are\nto be removed a number of times,\nthe nut and screws can be made of\nsteel to reduce wear and tear on the\nthreads and the risk of faulty\nthreads.\n\nThis work was done by Lawrence\nJ.

The atomic nature of solid\nsurfaces plays an important role in\nthe wear behavior for materials in\nsolid-state contact.\nWhile those solids that undergo\nwear can consist of a wide variety of\nmaterials both crystalline and\nnoncrystalline, wear is most frequently encountered with crystalline\nsolids . With elemental metals, the\nsurface will consist of the interface\nbetween the outermost layer of\natoms , which is not bound by a layer\nof like atoms, and the foreign\nmedium to which the layer is\nexposed. For alloys, the surface\nmay be more complex, containing a\n\nnumber of different elements or a\nparticular element that. because of\nenergy considerations, chooses to\nsegregate at the surface.\nThere are a number of tools that\ncan be extremely useful in the study\nof wear. They range from such\nunsophisticated techniques as\nSimple chemical etching to the use\nof the field ion microscope with atom\nprobe .\nThe surface tools, their use, and\nthe results obtained and described in\nthe report are : chemical etching .\nX-ray diffraction, electron diffraction , scanning electron microscopy,\n(continued next page)\n529\n\nlow-energy electron diffraction,\nAuger emission spectroscopy\nanalysis, electron spectroscopy for\nchemical analysis, field ion microscopy, and the atom probe. These\ndevices provide useful information\nas simple analytical tools to examine\nwear surfaces as well as to conduct\nin situ dynamic monitoring of wear\nstudies.\nAnalysis of wear surfaces and the\nwear process with these tools has\nindicated the anisotropic nature of\nthe wear process. Revealed are\nproperties of surfaces and wear\nsurface regions that affect wear,\nsuch as surface energy, crystal\nstructure, crystallographic orientation, mode of dislocation behavior,\nand cohesive binding. A number of\nmechanisms involved in the\ngeneration of wear particles are\nidentified with the aid of these tools.\nThe use of these surface tools has\ndone much to help clarify basic\nmechanisms involved in the friction\nand wear behavior of materials.\nContinued and expanded use of\nthese devices in the future will help\nto provide the necessary fundamental understanding of material surfaces, resulting in a reduction of\nfriction and minimizing maintenance\ncosts associated with wear.\nThis work was done by Donald H.\nBuckley of Lewis Research Center.\nFurther information may be found in\nNASA TM-X-73437 [N77-19901] ,\n"The Use of Analytical Surface\nTools in the Fundamental Study of\nWear, " a copy of which may be\nobtained at cost from the New\nEngland Research Application\nCenter [see page A 7J.\nLEW-12910\n\nDisconnects, Couplings,\nFittings, Fixed Joints, and\nSeals\nDesign criteria monograph\nA design monograph has been\nwritten to organize and present significant experience and knowledge\n\n530\n\naccumulated by NASA in development and operational programs.

The monograph treats component design rather than the procedure or process by which a part is\nmade.\nThe problem most prevalent in\nvalve-type disconnects is leakage,\nwhich may be caused by the misalinement of components, extreme\nenvironment. extreme fluid requirement, or mechanical loads.\nThe primary problem with couplings and seals also involves leakage, which may arise from structural\ndeflection, differential thermal\nexpansion, inadequate control of\nsurface finish and dimensions , or\nhandling damage.\nProblems with fittings that lead to\nleakage or inadequate functioning\nhave been due primarily to initial\ndesign inadequacies, such as\nimproper flow levels and flow distribution , excessive pressure loss, and\nundesirable thermal gradients.\nProblems with fixed joints include\nleaks, corrosion due to improper\ncleaning and purging , poor dimensional control of parts to be jOined,\nexcessive weld dropthrough that\nrestricts flow, and structural failures\ndue to inadequate support or higherthan-predicted vibrations.\n\nSince the primary problems related to the components discussed\nin the monograph are concerned\nwith design details, emphasis is\nplaced on experience with particular\ndetail problems and on successful\nproblem solutions .\nThe monograph comprises two\nmajor sections : "State of the Art , "\nand " Design Criteria and\nRecommended Practices."\nReferences complement the text .\nBoth major sections are divided\ninto six subjects: "Disconnects"\n(design configuration and integration) ; " Couplings" (design configuration and intergration) ; " Fittings"\n(configuration) ; "Fixed Joints"\n(welded, brazed , bonded , soldered ,\nand interference-fit) ; "Seals"\n(static-seal configuration and\nintegration and dynamic-seal configuration and integration) ; and\n" General Considerations for\nDesign" (material selection , handling , and testing) .\nThis monograph is one of a series\nbeing published on space vehicle\nchemical propulSion , environment,\nstructures , and guidance and control .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThis is the fi rst of four consecutive\narticles that describe systems and\ntechniques for obtaining aluminum\nalloy welds of the highest quality. In\nfabricating the crew module for the\nSpace Shuttle it was necessary to\ndevelop techniques to produce\nweldments of high integrity and\ndurability under severe conditions.\nThe magnitude of this program,\nillustrated in Figure 1, indicates the\nneed for a systematic approach.\nThe crew module is.made from\naluminum alloys of the 2219 series\nand is designed for automatic welding by the gas tungsten-arc process.\nThis process, with 100-percent\nhelium gas, produces a narrow\nstraight-sided bead that minimizes\ndistortion and avoids weld peaking.\nThe design philosophy is to use\nsquare-butt joints, kept away from\nsharp contour changes . Intersecting\nwelds are configured forT-type\nintersections rather than\ncrossovers. Differences in panel\nthickness are accommodated with\ntransition step areas where the\nthickness increases or decreases\nwithin the weld, but never at an\nintersection.\nHigh quality in the welds requires\naccurate dimensional control of\nparts and assemblies. In the machining of the parts, allowance is\nprovided for growth during aging and\nfor transverse shrinkage during\nwelding. Longitudinal shrinkage is\nconsidered in the tooling for subassemblies.\nThe tooling is a key element in\ncontrolling dimensions. It must be\nrigid and massive, as shown in\nFigure 2, to maintain moldline\ncontrol during welding. Yet, it must\nallow complex sculptured parts and\nsubassemblies to be loaded, trimmed, cleaned, welded, and removed\nwithout disassembly of the tooling .\nStainless-steel fingers and backup\nbars or contour backup members\nhold the parts in place . Penetration\nis controlled by a groove in the\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n[b]\n\nFigure 1. Fabrication of the Space Shuttle Crew Module required\ndevelopment of a systems approach to high-quality aluminum welding.\nThe 36 welds, some of which can be seen in color in (a), were performed\naccurately, reliably, and automatically with the aid of massive tooling.\nThe completed module (b) is essentially a large pressure vessel.\n(continued next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1977\n\n533\n\nFigure 2. The Multiple Assembly Weld Tool, shown here with sizing\nplug installed, is one of the special jigs that hold the parts for accurate\ndimensional control.

Flat or verticalclimb positions for welding are utilized whenever possible.\n\nTo avoid the risks in moving large\nparts, as well as the expense of\nelaborate handling eqUipment, a\nuniversal skate system was developed. This precision skate-and-track\n\narrangement allows routing, sawing,\nwelding, and x-raying in all positions. Joints are first tacked intermittently and then tacked continuously with a partial penetration.\nThe fill-penetration pass is either\nfollowed by or combined with a\ncover pass . The weld beads are\nground nearly flush to prevent\ncracking.\nThe universal skate welder is discussed separately in "Technology of\nWelding Aluminum Alloys - IV"\n(MSC-18084), in this issue. The\nother two topics that are treated\nindividually are techniques for\nmanual and machine welding in\n"Technology for Aluminum Welding\n- II" (MSC-18082) and the control of\nporosity in aluminum welds in\n"Technology for Aluminum Welding\n- III (MSC-18083) .\nThis \'WOrk was done by James R.\nHarrison, Lawrence J.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAs part of the welding improvement program described in the\npreceding article, step-by-step procedures were developed for high\nintegrity manual and machine\nwelding of aluminum alloys. These\nprocedures start with prewelding\nsteps for preparation of the jOint,\ncleaning , fit-up into tooling fixtures,\nselection and testing of shielding\ngas, and selection of the filler alloy.\nDetailed instructions are given for\neach of these steps with tables and\ngraphs to specify materials and\ndimensions.\n\n534\n\nThe welding is performed by\neither the gas tungsten-arc or gas\nmetallic-arc process. After the tack\nwelds, if any, and the first welding\nrun, the work is inspected in a prescribed manner. The bead may be\ncontoured and cleaned if necessary,\nand then the welding steps are\nrepeated until the operation is\ncompleted .\nThe finished weldment is removed\nfrom the tooling, and the head is\nflushed if required. After inspection ,\nparts are packaged , stored , or\nrouted to the next operation.\n\nThroughout this work sequence,\nthe proceSSing procedure designates manufacturing verification\npoints and inspection points. The\nquality assurance requirements are\nspelled out in detail and illustrated\nby many drawings; a typical\nexample is shown in the figure .\nQuality procedures for tests, inspections, and record-keeping are specified with the same thoroughness as\nthe processing procedures.\nManual and machine welding\npractices are similar, but differ in\ntwo respects .

When undercut or concavity exists in an area in\nconjunction with a suckback condition, the depth dimensions shall be\nadditive. All sharp notches (defined by depth greater than width) are\nunacceptable. For undercut, concavity, and suckback, the maximum\nallowable width "w" is the lesser of t/4 or 0.125 inch (smoothly\nblended).\n\nTechnology of Welding Aluminum Alloys - III\nControl of porosity\nin aluminum welds\n\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nControl of porosity in weld beads\nwas a major objective in the development of the aluminum welding\nprogram described in the two preceding articles . Porosity, the most\ndifficult defect to control, is caused\nby hydrogerr gas unable to escape\nfrom the bead during solidification .\nEither conventional spherical pores\nor long stringerlike defects are produced when the hydrogen bubbles\n\nfollow the molten bead as they try to\nsurface .\nTo allow the hydrogen gas to\nbubble out of the molten bead as\nmuch as possible , the ideal welding\nposition is either flat or a vertical\nclimb for the bead. The horizontal\nposition is undesirable for welding\nbecause hydrogen rising to the\nupper edge of the weld nugget is\ntrapped by the solid metal above the\n\nbead and therefore forms a pore.\nSoi loff of the hyd rogen is also\nfacilitated by a high bead temperature . Hard welding, in which the\njoint rests against a grooved backup\nplate. produces fewer pores than\nfree-fall welding. in which there is no\nmetal behind the joint (see figure) .\nThe chilling effect of the backup bar\nallows more heat to be put into the\nweld bead and thus allows greater\n(continued next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1917\n\n535\n\n---\n\nPART\nTO BE\nWELDED\n\nSUPPORT\nTOOLING\n\nlaJ\n\nTORCH~QJJ HOLD-DOWN\nSTAINLESS\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n\nFINGERS\n\nOPENING\nTO VIEW\nDROP-THROUGH\n\nR\n\nIbJ\nThe type of Tooling Affects Porosity in an aluminum weld bead.

Likewise,\ndefect-control considerations make\ndirect current superior to alternating\ncurrent for welding because the\nbead is hotter and narrower and thus\nhas reduced porosity. The use of\nhelium, rather than argon or an\nargon-helium mixture, also\nincreases the arc intensity and\nappears more effective in boiling off\nhydrogen .\nThe hydrogen is formed by the\nbreakdown of hydrocarbons and/or\nmoisture in the arc; therefore moisture is tightly controlled . The helium\ngas has a -7f!\' F (212 K) dew point\nand is piped through polyvinyl\nchloride tubing that does not absorb\nwater. The weld wire is packaged\nwith desiccants, stored in a hot drybox, and mounted on the welding\nhead in an airtight drum from which\nit is fed out by rollers through Nylon\ntubes.\nCleanliness of parts and tools is\nalso extremely important for avoidance of pores. Systematic procedures for handling, preparing,\ncleaning , and inspecting parts\nbefore welding thus contribute to\nhigh quality in aluminum welding .\nThis work was done by James R.\nHarrison, Lawrence J. Korb, and\nearl E. Oleksiak of Rockwell\nInternational Corp. for Johnson\nSpace Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAs part of the welding improvement program described in the three\npreceding articles , a skate-weld\ncarriage and track assembly were\ndeveloped for controlled fusion\nwelding on compound-curvature\nsurfaces . Unlike the fixed-position\ncarriage used for vertical , hori-\n\n536\n\nlontal, and circumferential welding ,\nthis carriage has a suspension\nsystem that permits angular positioning of the weld head on the\ncarriage. It also has a carriage-anddrive track mechanism capable of\ntraveling over compound curvatures , which is not possible with the\n\nrack-and-pinion drive mechanism in\nexisting skate welders. Figure 1\nshows the complete skate welder.\nPrevious track welders were\nlimited to coplanar curved paths.\nFlexible-type skate drives have been\navailable , but they could not provide\npositive tracking over compound\ncurves .\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1977\n\nThe, carriage incorporates a threepoint suspension system that allows\nangular positioning of the carriage .\nThis is accomplished by two followers on the carriage. The followers\nengage a guide bar on the outboard\nside of the track, as shown in Figure\n2. The bar is positioned byadjustable supports and is formed to the\ncontours of the surface to be\nwelded . Rack-and-pinion drive is replaced with a contoured drive track\nthat has special teeth that mate with\na compatible drive gear on the carriage . This driving mechanism provides positive tracking over the\ncurved contours where the welding\nmust be done . Spring-mounted\nrollers even hold the skate drive\nengagement in vertical or overhead\nweld positions .\nThe carriage is designed with a\nuniversal mounting platform so that\na trim tool , a weld head, or an X-ray\nunit can be interchanged without\nneed for any realinement. Since all\nthree of these are required in each\nweld operation, their simple interchangeability saves time and\nassures precision.\n\nDETAIL A\n\nFigure 1. The Universal Skate-Welder carriage can carry a trim tool, a\nwelding torch, or an X-ray head over compound curvatures on any\nassembly.

The Vacuum-Soldering Chamber contains a heater, a heat\nsink, and push rods for manipulation of the solder fixture.\n538\n\nPrevious methods for joining\nmetalized-ceramic microstrips to\ntitanium carriers have resulted in\nvoids and airspaces between the\nmetalized surface of the ceramic\nand the carrier. In many ca$es , the\ncomposites have been judged unsuitable for aerospace and microelectronic applications because of\nthis problem. By using a new\nvacuum-soldering method, attachments that are 85 to 95 percent void\nfree can now be made. This method\nshould be useful for various largescale substrate attachment processes in the microelectronic industry.\nThe titanium carrier is seen at the\nupper left of Figure 1, along with the\nflat solder shim stock and the\nceramic substrate. The substrate\nhas electronic circuitry on one side\nand a metallic coating on the other .\nAt the bottom of the figure is the\nsolder assembly fixture.\nThe vacuum-soldering chamber is\nseen in Figure 2. A heat sink is\nlocated at the left center of the\nchamber and a heater block at the\nright. Push rods are included to\ntransfer the solder assembly\nbetween the heater and the heat\nsink. The parts are assembled and\nplaced on the heat sink, as seen in\nFigure 3. Also shown are asbestos\npads that are placed over the assembly and a weight used to exert a\ndownward force . The weighted assembly is transferred to the heater\nby manipulating the push rods after\nthe chamber has been evacuated .\nAfter solder flow, the push rods are\nused to return the soldered assembly to the heat sink , and positive\npressure is applied to the vacuum\nsoldering chamber.\nPrior to thei r being mounted in the\nfixture, the parts are cleaned ultrasonically in 1,1,1-trichloroethane for\n10 minutes, are rinsed in fresh\n1,1,1-trichloroethane and then in\nisopropyl alcohol , and are blown dry\nwith dry nitrogen gas. They are\nplaced in a clean petri dish and are\ncovered with distilled water.\nNASA Tech Briefs , W inter 1977\n\nThe surface of the ceramic sub-strate is scrubbed with a felt-tipped\napplicator for the removal of residual\nfilms , is rinsed in isopropyl alcohol,\nand is blown dry with dry nitrogen .

In some instances the two\nends to be welded are deep within a\nsubsystem . With numerous components crowded nearby, radiographic\ninspection of the weld is very costly\nand time consuming and may be\nimpossible in many cases .\nHowever, a new study finds that\nwhen an automatic in-place tubewelding head is used to butt-weld\ntwo stainless-steel tubes together ,\nthe welding process can be made so\nreliable that when the weld exceeds\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , W inter 1977\n\na certain minimum dimension , penetration of the weld can be assumed\nto be complete . A detailed procedure for tube welding has been\ndeveloped that considers the effects\nof arc gap, shielding gas, welding\nspeed , and other parameters related\nto weld reliability. When the procedure is adhered to, the minimum\ndimension criterion becomes a\nSimple visual test of the weld quality.\nThe test is performed by verifying\nthat:\n- The welded tubes are alined axially\naccording to specifications;\n- Oxide discoloration of the tubes is\nnot darker than " straw" color;\n-The weld concavity is within specifications ; and\n\n- The weld width at any point around\nthe tube exceeds a minimumdimension criterion that depends\non the tube diameter and thickness.\nWhen these criteria are not met,\nradiographic inspection is\nnecessary.\nA new inspection tool [described\non page 540 of this issue in "TubeWeld Inspection Tool " (NPO-13978)]\ngreatly aids the visual inspect I""\nprocedure, which should be applicable to other high-performance weld\nsituations .\nThis work was done by Joseph C.\nLewis of CaltechlJPL.For further\ninformation, Circle 61 on the TSP\nRequest Card.\nNP0-13977\n\n539\n\ni i\n\nTube-Weld Inspection Tool\nCalibrated notch and fiber optics\nare used to determine weld integrity.\n\nGaltechlJPL, Pasadena, California\nALiNEMENT DEVICE\n(TIGHTLY CLAMPED\nAROUND TUBE TO\nKEEP INSPECTION\nHEAD ALiNED\nWITH WELD.)\n\nTWO-PIECE\nINSPECTION HEAD\n\nThis Tube-Weld-Dimension Inspection Tool compares the weld width\nwith a notch width. The weld is considered satisfactory if the weld is\nwider than the notch. The figure is schematic, enlarged, and somewhat\ndistorted to show significant elements. The fiber optics permit the\ninspection head to be completely rotated around the tube for complete\ninspection of the weld. A 45 0 mirror over the notch aids in comparing the\nnotch and weld widths.\n\nIn crowded systems , tube welds\nmay be inaccessible to conventional\nX-ray radiographic inspection . A\nnew tool that uses a calibrated notch\nand fiber optics can be used for\nsimple visual inspection of welds in\nhard-ta-reach areas .\nThe inspection head is clamped\n(slip-fit) around the tube and is\nali ned with the weld as shown in the\nfigure. Light is transmitted through\nthe fiber optics to illuminate the weld\narea. The operator then looks into a\nmagnifying eyepiece that compares\nthe width of the weld to the width of\na notch in the inspection head\n(which lie in the same optical plane).\nIf the weld width exceeds the notch\nwidth, the weld is considered satisfactory . [See "Linear Dimension\nEstablishes Weld Integrity"\n(N PO-13977) on page 539 of this\nissue.] The fiber optics permit the\noperator to rotate the inspection\nhead completely around the tube to\ncompare the width of each increment of weld to the width of the\ntube.\n\nThis work was done by Howard B.\nStanford of CaltechlJPL.

Surface area,\nand consequently heat dissipation ,\ncan be considerably increased by\nusing a star-shaped , rather than a\nround cross section (see figure) .\nWhen used with modern high540\n\ntemperature insulating materials ,\nthe pointed-star wire is suitable for\napplications where low-cost lightweight wire is required .\nStandard 12-gage copper wire\nhas a circumference of 251 mils\n(0 .64 cm) .

Aluminum , however, is an excellent substitute. It makes reliable\nbeam leads and can be used with\nminor modifications in existing processing equipment. However, many\nof the physical and chemical properties of aluminum are quite different\nfrom those of gold aod must be\ntaken into account if the less expensive metal is to be used successfully.\nA report, based on a study of attachment methods for IC\'s with\naluminum beam leads, makes it\nrelatively easy for hybrid-circuit\nmanufacturers to convert to IC chips\nwith aluminum beam leads. The report covers: techniques for handling\nthe tiny chips ; proper geometries for\nultrasonic bonding tips; the best\ncombinations of pressure, pulse\ntime , and ultrasonic energy for bonding; and the best thickness for the\nmetal films to which the beam leads\nare bonded. The report is based 0n\n\nan investigation of bonding techniques and tests of bonded devices.\nA major difference from gold\nbeam-lead bonding is the layer of\noxide on the aluminum. If this layer\nis not penetrated by the bonding tip,\nthe bond is not reliable . If the tip penetrates too deeply, the beam is\nweakened and can break. The solution is to use a small hemispherical\nsapphire tip, 75 mm in diameter.\nAnother major difference is that\naluminum beam leads attach best to\nrelatively thick metalization on the\nhybrid substrate. The accepted\nstandard in the semiconductor industry for ultrasonic bonding is a\n12,000-angstrom nickel-chromiumaluminum interconnection pattern.\nHowever, when aluminum beam\nleads are bonded to such films,\nholes are created in the beam leads.\nWhen the film thickness is increased to the 25,000- to 60,000angstrom range , bonding quality is\nconsistent and reliable.\nWith the thicker metal, a modification is necessary in the process\nused to etch a conductor pattern in\nthe metal film . The acid etchant\n\nordinarily used undercuts the thick\nmetal film . Substitution of a hot agitated alkaline etchant solves the\nproblem.\nWhen proper bonding conditions\nand procedures are used, the bonded units easily pass electrical and \'\nmechanical tests. Environmental\ntests (thermal shock, vibration\nfatigue, and step stress) of 144 units,\nfor example, produced no failures.\nOver the entire test program, transistor beta varied by no more than\n\xc2\xb1 2 percent. Operators quickly became proficient and produced a\nvery high yield of good bond. Nearly\n1,000 beams were ultrasonically\nbonded with less than 0.2 percent\nbond failures.\nThis work was done by F.

In addition , if the parts\nare later separated , the seal tends to\nstick to the flat surface OPPOSite the\ngroove. This damages the O-ring,\nwhich must be replaced before the\nseal is reestablished .\nA proposed sealing techn ique\ncombines a normal seal with a\nspring, as shown in the figure . When\ntiny O-rings are involved , the spring\nis a steel disk around which the ring\nis molc;led . (An optional " handle"\n\ncan be fitted onto the disk to make it\neasier to insert the spring between\nthe metal surfaces to be sealed .)\nWhen the O-ring lies flat on the surface , the technique can be modified\nto allow the seal/spring combination\nto be locked in place by a screw or\nrivet at its center, mooring the disk\nto one of the surfaces.\nIn addition to O-rings, the technique may be applied to soft or hard\nseals or to other geometries , such\nas triangular seals .

The seal could\nbe mounted either inside or outside\nthe seal line, and it could be\ninstalled in final assembly without\nexposing the part to the heat and\npressure of curing .\nThis work was done by Jon W.\n44.artin and Harry M.

The O-ring is molded around the\nspring much like a tire on a rim. The metal disk can be fastened in place\nto hold the O-ring firmly. A handle on the spring helps one to put the\nspring/seal combination between the surfaces to be sealed.\n\nMetallic Coating Reduces\nThermal Stress\nThermal stress in high-temperature/high-strength materials can\nbe substantially reduced by adding a\nmetallic outer layer that has high\nthermal conductivity. The layer can\nbe deposited by standard plating\nprocesses .

The process should\nallow a wide range of controlled\nporosity materials to be manufactured at low cost.\n(See page 487 .)\n\nImproved Si/icone-Rubber-toSilicone-Rubber Bonding\nFlatwise tensile-test results indicate that stronger silicone-rubberto-silicone-rubber bonds result if the\nrubber is left unprimed and the\ncured surface is lightly abraded\nbefore the uncured layer is applied .\nAverage maximum tensile loads for\nseveral specimens were more than\ndoubled by this procedure, indicating that standard bonding methods\nshould be modified.\n(See page 488.)\n\n547\n\nCast-In-Place Grommets for Honeycomb Substrates\nCable grommets are easily\ninstalled without weakening subchassis.\n\nCaltechlJPL, Pasadena, California\nTo reduce weight, some electronic assemblies, such as those\nused in spacecraft, must be\nmounted in lightweight, relativelyweak honeycomb subchassis. These\nhoneycomb structures are weakened even further if conventional\ncable grommets are installed in the\nhoneycomb web.\nA new Teflon grommet that is\ncast-in-place (see figure) is easily\ninstalled and compatible with honeycomb structural integrity. After\ncasting, the grommet blank has only\na minimum hole size; however, the\nopening can be enlarged by drilling\nto accommodate a range of larger\ncable diameters.

However,\nuntil now, it has been impossible to\nattach thermocouples to columbium\nthrust chambers for testing. Conventional welding methods\n(capacitance-discharge spot\nwelding and heliarc welding with\nstainless-steel rod and even with\nhigh-columbium-content rod) used\nfor stainless-steel or molybdenum\nchambers has been ineffective. Test\nengineers have resorted to springloading tungsten-rhenium thermocouples so that thei r exposed junctions pressed against the chamber\n\nwall; but the data that resulted\nseemed highly suspicious because\nthey differed widely from the\nexpected temperature readings.\nTo solve the problem, an investigation was made of thermocouple\nwelding, with the goals of finding a\nsuitable welding method, evaluating\nthermocouple materials, and developing a welding procedure . Using\ntitanium weld rod turned out to be\nthe answer to the attachment problem. A small bead of titanium,\nheliarc-welded to the columbium\nchamber (with or without its coating\nbeing ground off), adhered so tightly\nthat it could not be dislodged with a\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1977\n\nhammer and chisel . Next, various\nthermocouples were tested for\nresponsiveness and durability when\ntitanium-welded to columbium .

Platinum-6 percent rhodium/\nplatinum-30 percent rhodium\n\ncouples perform ideally in measuring temperatures up to 3,300\' F\n(1 ,8000 C) - a high enough range\nfor the temperatures that occur in\nthe columbium chamber .\nAlthough the platinum-rhodium\nalloys clearly make the best themxr\ncouple , they are extremely expensive. The long run of thermocouple\nwire to reach a reference junction\nbox - standard pr~ctice with\nChromel-Alumel and other common\nthermocouple materials - would be\nprohibitive . Instead , a short length of\nplatinum-rhodium wire can be connected to a copper extension wire\nthat leads directly to the instrumentation; but this means that the reference junction (the thermocouplewi re-to-copper-wire junction) will be\nat ambient temperature . It is important , therefore, to protect this junc-\n\ntion so that it will not be influenced\nby heat radiated fromlhe engine.\nUsually, merely insulating or\nshielding it is enough.\nThe procedure developed for\nattaching thermocouples is simple\nand explicit. It includes such steps\nas preparing the columbium surface\nby cleaning it, depoSiting a globule\nof titanium, and remelting the\nglobule and inserting the thermocouple wires in it.\nThis work was done by Frank R.\nDeMonbrun, Lawrence A.

The projected density O(Xo)\nis processed to represent a continuum of values as a function of probe\nposition for a particular angle of\nprojection. Further sets of projections are then taken at different scan\nangles, e.g., 4> .\n\nThe image is reconstructed by the\np[ecise lllver-se of scanning, Signal-\n\nvalues corresponding to the density\nof projection are added as constant\nterms along the line corresponding\nto the original path between the two\nprobes that give rise to that density\nvalue.

Such superposition may be\naccomplished by a computer or by\nany imaging device capable of the\nappropriate time-exposure reci-\n\nprocity, such as film or scan converter displays.

When the image is recorded as digital data, the matching\nprocedures (registration) can be\nused to detect changes in ground\nfeatures as a function of time . For\ninstance, registration based on\nsatellite imagery is used to estimate\ncloud velocities for global weather\ninformation . For multispectral\ncamera data, images from the different camera stations must be\nregistered before analysis can be\nperformed.\nSince image registration typically\ninvolves large quantities of raw data,\nit is desirable to make the procedure\nmore efficient and shorten computer\nrun time. A registration technique\nthat matches binary boundary maps\nextracted from the raw data, rather\nthan matching the actual data, is\nconsiderably faster than other techniques [such as the fast Fouriertransform (FFT) correlation routine] .\nThe boundary maps, which are\ndigital representations of regions\nwhere the image amplitudes change\nsignificantly , typically represent a\ndata compression of 60 to 70 percent. Additional data simplifications are made by working with\nsequences of boundary points .\nSince the binary boundary maps\ncontain only " O\'s" and "1\'s" ,\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1977\n\ncomputational factors needed for\nregistration, such as averageamplitude products, are always\npositive and are sharpened so that\nthe removal of means and normalization is not necessary. Furthermore, the maps allow the average\nproducts to be computed with addition rather than multiplication,\nfurther reducing computation time.\nThe program that generates the\nboundary maps runs about 13\nminutes on a large computer , for an\narea of 1,000 row scans by 255\ncolumns. This includes time to read\nand compile the program in addition\nto the calculation time. The program\ncalculates the average change in the\ndata at each row and column intersection for displacements by a\nsingle row or column. The spectroscopic changes in the x (scan) and y\n(column) directions are stored in a\njoint histogram. These changes may\nbe selected as boundary points if\nthey are large compared to the x\nand y modes of the joint histogram.\nIn this comparison "largeness" is\ndecided by a discriminating criterion\nwith several decision input parameters . The selected points are\nassigned the value "1" ; the remaining points are aSSigned " 0" to form\nthe boundary map that corresponds\nto the image.\nPairs of boundary maps are registered according to a correlation and\nregistration procedure that\ncompares one map (the "picture " )\n\nwith local areas ("windows") on the\nother map. It is assumed that the\nimages can be registered through\ntranslations and rotations only, that\nthe images have the same scale,\nand that little or no distortion exists .\nIt is further assumed that by working\nwith several local areas, rotation\neffects in the local areas can be\nneglected; by treating\nmisalinements of the local areas as\ntranslations , rotational and translational misalinements of the larger\nimages can be determined . This\nprocedure can be repeated until the\ndesired degree of registration is\nachieved. When correlating,\nsequences of boundary points on the\nwindow and the picture are\ncompared, and row and column\nshifts are made until coincidence is\nmaximized .\nThis work was done by J. F.\nAndrus, C. W. Campbell, and R. R.\nJayroe of Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

Limit loads describing the extreme design condition are typically defined as percentile values (e.g., 30) of the nominalload probability distribution.\nA new method for defining limit\nloads uses the probab11ity distribution of the largest load occurring\nduring given time intervals. The\nmethod is compatible with both deterministic and probabilistic structural deSign criteria. It also rationally\naccounts for the fact that the longer\na structure is exposed to a random\nloading environment, the greater is\nthe possibility that it will experience\nan extreme load.\nThe lognormal distribution is proposed as an acceptable approximation to the exact distribution of normal extremes. Referring to equation\n1 in the figure, the design limit load\n\nInxp\n\n= In<Y\xc2\xb7o) + Kp \xc2\xb76\n\nf\n\nv+..\n\nwhere p =\n\n(1 )\n\nKp2/\ne - tj 2dt\n\n_00\n\nF(Y) -\n\nexp\n\n(2)\n\n~lnO.5) [1 - F(~)IJ\n\n6 = 0.OO199u - 0.0633 + O.6634u - 1 - 0.2648u - 2 for 1\n1\\\n\nu-\n\n[\n\n~1/2\n\n2In(T\'E[N+(0)~\n\n< U<16\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nEquations Defining the Design Limit Load [xp1 are discussed in the text.\n(xp) is defined as the pX1 00 percentile value of the lognormal variate representing the random extreme largest load. In equation 1,0\nrepresents the standard deviation of\nthe nominal load probability distribution. The standardized extreme median (y) and the parameter d are expressed in equations 2 and 3 in\nterms of the standardized characteristic largest value (0) given in equation 4. In this equation, E[N + (0)) is\nthe expected rate of zero crossings\nwith positive slope, as given by\n\nRice\'s standard formula, and T is the\ngiven time duration for which the\nlargest load is desired. The method\nis primarily a comprehensive interpretation of load quantities that are\ntypically calculated as part of conventional structural analyses for random loading conditions.\n\nAutonomous Rendezvous and\nFeature Detection System\n\nOptimizing Simulated\nTrajectories\n\nAutomated Process Planning\nSystem\n\nAlgorithms and equations have\nbeen developed for converting\nstandard televiSion-image data into\nsteering signals for spacecraft.\nAccurate relative position is obtained by scanning a ground area that\n" overlaps " the spacecraft edge ,\nthen converting the images into\nthreshold maps. The data can\naugment primary spacecraft guidance , navigation , and attitudecontrol equipment.\n(See page 451 .)\n\nA general-purpose, six-degreesof-freedom program solves a variety\nof rigid-body flight-mechanics problems .

The\nhandbook provides rapid access to a\nwide variety of element types and\ncan facilitate the evaluation of different elements as to their features ,\nprobable accuracy\', and complexity.\n\nThe compilation can serve as a\nguide in the choice of nonlinear\nelements for specific problems and\nas background to provide directions\nfor new element developments. It\nshould be particularly useful in generating computer codes for finite\nelements.\nThe elements are classified according to type as beams, plates.\nshells, and solid or three-dimensional elements. Within each type,\nthe elements are further identified by\nthe assumed displacement shape\nand form of the nonlinear strain\nequations. Solution procedures are\ndeemphasized. except when a\nparticular element formulation poses\nspeCial problems or capabilities .\nEach handbook description includes a brief definition of the\nelement. followed by the displacement function equations and a concise description of the element in\nnarrative form . This is followed by an\nidentification of the reference in\nwhich the element was derived,\n\nvariations from the basic element .\nand any known advantages or disadvantages it may have. The strain\ndisplacement equations are given to\nindicate how the geometric nonlinearities are introduced into the\nstrains and what nonlinearities are\nincluded in the formulation. Finally,\nthere is a discussion of the element\nthat presents user-oriented information concerning material description, coordinate systems, and\nsolution procedures .\nThis \'NOrk was done by R.

Designers preparing a\nsoftware system that requires\nplotted output will find that this\npackage offers many advantages\nover the standard hardware support\npackages available.\nThe WOLF package is divided into\na plot segment and a contour\nsegment. The plot segment can\nproduce output for any combination\nof line-printer, SC4020, Gerber,\nCalcomp, and S04060 plots . The\nline printer allows the user to have\nplots available immediately after a\njob is run at a low cost.\nAlthough the resolution of lineprinter plots is low, the quick results\nallow one to judge whether a highresolution plot of a particular run is\ndesirable. The SC4020 and S04060\nprovide high-speed high-resolution\ncathode-ray plots , with film and\n\nhard-copy output available. The\nGerber and Calcomp plotters\nprovide very-high-quality (of publishable quality) plots of good\nresolution . Being bed- or drum-type\nplotters, the Gerber and Calcomp\nplotters are usually slow and not\nsuited for large-volume plotting .\nAll output for any or all of the\nplotters can be produced simultaneously . The types of plots supported\nare : linear, semilog , logllog , polar.\ntabular data using the FORTRAN\nWRITE statement, 3-D perspective\nlinear, and affine transformations. A\nlabeling facility prepares horizontal\nlabels, vertical labels, diagonal\nlabels, vector characters of a\nrequested size (special character\nfonts are easily implemented) , and\nrotated letters. Gridding routines\nlabel the gridlines according to user\nspecifications .

The package can contour\nany data that can be placed on a grid\nand any data that are regularly\nspaced , including any general affine\nor polar grid data. The package\nincludes routines that will grid\nrandom data. Contour levels can be\nspecified at any values desired.\nInput data can be smoothed , with\nundefined points being acceptable\nwhere data are unreliable or\nunknown. Plots that are extremely\n\n558\n\nlarge or detailed can be automatically output in parts , to improve\nresolution or overcome plotter size\nlimitations. The contouring segment\nuses the plot segment for actual\nplotting; thus all the features described for the plotting segment are\navailable to the user of the contouring segment.\nIncluded with this package are\ntwo data bases for producing world\nmap plots in Mercator projection .\nOne data base provides continent\noutlines only , and another provides\ncontinent outlines and national\nborders in great detail.\n\nThis package is written in\nFORTRAN IV and IBM OS Assembler\nand has been implemented on an\nIBM 360 with a central memory\nrequi rement of approximately 140K\nof 8-bit bytes .
