"Vega ai\xc2\xb1plane is a very clean-cut design,\nsuitable for commercial purposes. While the methods of construction used. are so far in advance of present-day general\npractice as to seem almost radical, no item in its design or\nfabrication departs from proven successful and advanced. methods. A glance at the general arrangement shows a cleanliness\nof line and. lack of parasite resistance seen only in the high\nspeed and. costly racing types. Because of this beauty of line\nthat is absolutely essential in successful raciiig airplanes,\nthe Lockheed. Vega will carry the same pay load. farther and\nfaster with less fuel expenditure than any of the present-day\ntypes. A moment\'s thought will show that ten or fifteen miles\nan hour greater cruising speed. or two or three hundred feet a\n/\nminute greater climb at altitude will often make the difference between success or failure in the commercial application\nof aircraft to severe service conditions. Combined with clean\nlines, the Lockheed. method of construction enables us to pr\nduce airplanes of the greatest possible strength and ruggedness\nfor a given weight.(Figs. 1, 2, 3, and. 4).\n*Prepared by the Lockheed A ircraft Company.\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 61 \t\n\n2\n\nMethods of Construction\nFuselage.- Wherever perfect streamline and highest quality are required, monocoque plywood fuselages have always\nbeen used. This type of fuselage construction has been used\nfor all successful modern racing airplanes (including Italy\'s\nsuccessful contender in the 1926 Schneider Cup race, and the\nfamous Curtiss racers of past years) as well as some of the\nmost recent and successful military airplanes of Great Britain\nand France.\nMonocoque plywood construction has not been used to a\nlarge extent for the manuIacture of commercial aircraft because\nof its excessive cost.\t\n\nnother disadvantage has been the dif-\n\nficulty of obtaining a perfect product because of the laborious processes generally used in applying and gluing each strip\nof wood separately to the form over which the fuselage is usually built.\nBy a patented process, developed by Malcolm Loughead\n(inventor of the Lockheed Hydraulic Brake), Allan Loughead,\nJohn K. Northrop, and Anthony Stadlman, which is exclusively\ncontrolled by this company, one-half of the complete fuselage\nshell is assembled, and glued as a unit, under a pressure of\n150 tons, so that an absolutely perfect, uniform, and homogeneous shell of plywood results. The materials used are verS\n\ntical grain spruce and best quality casein glue, so that with\nproper protective coverings the strength and life of the plywood is practically unaffected by time.\n\n1\n\nJ\n\n-\t\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 61\n\n\t\n\n3\n\nThe completed fuselage shells are assembled to laminated\nspruce diaphrais or rings, which hold the shells rigidly in\nple, and make of the fuselage in effect a giant tube, tapered\nat both ends, which gives the greatest possible strength for a\ngiven weight (Figs. 5, 6, 7, and a).\nAt points of concentrated loading, such as engine mount,\nwing and tail surface attacliment, and landing gear attachment,\nheavier stiffening diaphragns are uaed, so that the bending\nand torsional loads are uniformly distributed throughout the\nshell. A short section of aluminum cowling around the engine\nin front. and a small aluminum fairing in the rear complete the\nfuselage structure, which is perfectly streamlined, and requires\nno alignment, inspection, recovering, dr further attention except for an occasional coat of varnish or lacquer. Minor repairs are simply made by cutting away the damaged section o\xc2\xb1\nshell and nailing and gluing in a new panel of plywood between\nthe adjacent transverse diaphrais. In case of a serious crash,\nthe tremendous strength and resiliency of the structure tend to\nminimize\' the damage done both to airplane and personnel. There\nare no struts, longerons or wires to cut or impale anything\ncarried within the fuselage, and in -the worst cases a complete\nnew fuselage can be furnished at a cost below that at which\nother types can be rebuilt.\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circu.lar No. 61\n\n\t\n\n4\n\nWinRs.- The Lockheed \'Ve\' monoplane wing is ofthe full\ncantilever plywood covered type pioneered by Anthony H. G.\nFokker, and successfully used by Mr. Fokker, as well as others,\nfor a number of years. By the application of the utmost care\nin desii, this wing has been built to compare favorably in\nweight to the conventional wood and fabric type, thus eliminating the one objection of excessive weight that has heretofore\nbeen raised. The spars arc of spruce box type, with spruce\ncaps and spruce plywood webs. The spars taper in depth and\nsize in proportion to the load imposed throughout the wing,\nbeing about 18 inches deeD in the center and 5 inches deep at\nthe tips.\nThe ribs are of the latest type of girder construction\ngiving the maximum possible strength to weight ratio. The\nwhole wing is covered with 3/32 inch spruce plywood, which\nadds greatly to the general stiffness and rigidity of the\nstructure, and does away with the necessity of periodical recovering. Experienced operators know that loose fabric will\ninterfere seriously with an airplane\'s performance as well as\nrender its use dangerous. The wing of the Iockheed htVegaU with\nan occasional protective coat of varnish will remain equally\nefficient throughout the life of the airplane. The features\nof ruggedness and ease of repair that apply to the monocoque\nfuselage, are equally aplicab1e to this plywood-covered wing\nand result in a minimum of attention, inspection and repair.\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 61\n\n\t\n\n5\n\nThe wing is \xe2\x80\xa2atached to the fuselage at 4 points by 16 standard\n5/16 inch diameter tie rods, giving a factor of safety of over\n30 at this point. The main wing fittings are provided with eyes\nfor hoisting the wing or airplane when required.\nControl Surfaces.- Control surfaces carry out the same type\nof construction as above outlined, being covered with plywood,\nand rigidly reinforced where necessary. The ailerons are attached to the wing throughout their full length at the upper\nedge by means of a continuous duralumin hinge. The aileron\nloads are in this rnanne .r distributed throughout the whole wing,\nand the gap between wing and aileron is completely closed, obviating any possible danger through jamming with snow and. ice in\ncold weather. The movable tail surfaces are also carefully\nfitted to reduce the gap to a minimum and prevent jamming.\nAttacIient of all surfaces is simple and their removal, when\nnecessary, may be quickly accomplished. The stabilizer is adjustable, being actuated by two small diameter screws operating in trunnions at its leading edge. Special attention has\nbeen paid. to the stabilizer attaclnent and actuating mechanism\nto insure &osolute rigidity, and at places where wear might\noccur in service, due to the continuous pounding and vibration\nto which the tail is subjected, extra large bearing surfaces\nare provided. The stabilizer is a cantilever structure and. is\ncarried through the fuselage without a break in order to obtain all possible strength and stiffness.\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft CircularNo. 61\t\n\n6\n\nLanding gear.- Airplane wheels 30 X 5 are provided as\nstandard equipment and. may be replaced when desired in wet\nweather by 32\n\nX\n\n6 tires. The wheeis.are mounte&-n-a-c .hiome-\n\nmolybdenum alloy steel ftivided type axle, which is braced by\ntwo struts, one extending to the rear and one upward to the\nfuselage. Standard shock absorber cord is used as the shock\nabsorbing medium, the rebound being taken by a special hydraulic\ntype snubber. The shock cord is carried on duplicate bridges,\nhoused within the shock absorbing strut, in such a manner that\nit is absolutely protected from weather and dirt, and failure\nor breakage of one of the two sets of cords in each strut will\nnot cause failure of the strut or damage to the airplane. The\nuse of rubber shock cord in combination with suitable snubber,\ngives the non-rebound advantages of the oleo gear, and has\nadditional advantages in that it is simpler, not subject to\ntroubles due to oil leakage, and provides a fully adequate\nspring system during taxying as well.as when landing. The tail\nskid also of heat-treated alloy steel tubing is exceptionally\nwell braced. It. is rubber sprung, and a hardened alloy steel\nshoe is attached, which is reversible to provide for further\nuse after one end is worn out.\nLockheed hydraulic wheel brakes are provided, being built\ninto the fairing of the wheels in such a manner that no additional head resistance results in their use. Steering action\nis provided by means of th .e rudder pedals which increase\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 61\n\n\t\n\n7\n\nthe braking action on one side and proportionately decrease it\n.on the other when operated while the brakes are engageth Provision is also made for locking the brakes when starting or\nwarming up the engine.\nPower P1at.- The engine provided for standard installation is the Wright utWhirlwind U J-5 220\t\n\n. Due to the compar-\n\natively light weight and lack of parasite resistance of the\nLockheed \'Vega monoplane, it is possible to operate the\n"Whirlwind at little over one-half its rated power output,\nand still maintain a cruising speed close to the maximum speed\nof most competing types. This advantage further \'engthens the\nserviceable life of the engine and decreases the already remote chance of breakage or serious damage.\nAs previously stated, the nose of the airplane is completed\nby a section of aluminum cowling. The engine is partially\nhoused within this cowling, being mounted on a steel framework,\nahead of a carefully fitted fire shield. Carburetor drains\nand air intake are carried outside the cowling, which is readily removable for inspection or repair to the engine. No wQoden\nmembers are used within the engine section.\nGasoline is carried in two 50-gallon tanks cradled between\nthe wing spars just outside the fuselage. This excess built-in\ntankage provides an emergency cruising radius of over 1000\nmiles when occasion demands, and is ready for immediate use at\nany time. It should be noted that the nQrmal wing loading of\n\nI\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 61\nabout 11 pounds is a very reasonable loading for this type of\nairplane. For this reason, excess emergency loads may be carried without seriously reducing the performance. Normal gas\ncapacity is 55 gallons, or fuel for about 550 miles.\nThe tanks are p rovided with a simple dump valve for emergency use. The fuel feed is by gravity, of the simplest possible type, without pumps or pressure system complications,\nand consists simply of a fuel line from each tank with a shutoff convenient to the pilot, connecting to a strainer located\nso that it may be drained while in flight and a single line\nfrom strainer to carburetor.\nNumerous tests have proven that the fireproof ing of aircraft consists, to a large extent, in the proper installation\nof power plant, tanks, and piping.\nIn the Lockheed Vea" monoplane the engine is supported\non a simple all-steel mount, in a fireproof compartment, carefully insulated from the rest of the airplane. With the fuel\ntanks protected from damage in the strongest part of the wing,\noutside the fuselage, it is practically impossible for gasoline to come in contact with any of the engine parts, even in\nthe most serious crash.\nGeneral Arrangement\nDuring the past two years, the high-wing monoplane type\nhas come more and more to the front, until at the present time\nit is generally accepted as the standard arrangement for medium\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 61 \t\n\n9\n\nsize commercial airplanes . Due to the deep wing and well-\'\nstreamlined fuselage of the 11Vega, u this general arrangement is\ndoubly attractive, affording as it does, perfect. vision, as\nwell as very excellent protection for the pilot in case of a\nnose-over. The \' pilot\' s cockpit is well shielded, and comfortable, and has a transparent cover which may be slid into place\nwhen desired, enclosing the pilot for additional wath and\nprotection in bad weather.\nThe large unobstructed cabin provides ample space for four\npassengers and baggage, or six passengers if desired, and the\ncomfortably upholstered wicker seats may be quickly removed to\nprovide cargo space, of which 100 cubic feet is available.\nComplete perfoance data may be found \'by referring to the\ngeneral arrangent drawings following. While the speed and\nclimb of the Lockheed U Vea U may seem almost phenomenal, these\nfigures are conservative.\n\nN.A.C.A.
