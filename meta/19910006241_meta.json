The Laboratory Telerobotic Manipulator (LTM) is a highly advanced 7 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) telerobotic/robotic manipulator. It was developed and built for the Automation Technology Branch at NASA's Langley Research Center (LaRC) for work in research and to demonstrate ground-based telerobotic manipulator system hardware and software systems for future NASA applications in the hazardous environment of space. The LTM manipulator uses an embedded wiring design with all electronics, motor power, and control and communication cables passing through the pitch-yaw differential joints. This design requires the number of cables passing through the pitch/yaw joint to be kept to a minimum. To eliminate the cables needed to carry each pitch-yaw joint's sensor data to the VME control computers, a custom-embedded electronics package for each manipulator joint was developed. The electronics package collects and sends the joint's sensor data to the VME control computers over a fiber optic cable. The electronics package consist of five individual subsystems: the VME Link Processor, the Joint Processor and the Joint Processor power supply in the joint module, the fiber optics communications system, and the electronics and motor power cabling.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19910006241, "endDate": "1991-02-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Topical Meeting on Robotics and Remote Systems", "location": "Albuquerque, NM", "id": "9bbc426c9f594c939a4af59135eb1951", "startDate": "1991-02-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910006241, "id": "07f7dbf5226142bdac8dc1e631130ea8", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910006241.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910006241/downloads/19910006241.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910006241/downloads/19910006241.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910006241/downloads/19910006241.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
