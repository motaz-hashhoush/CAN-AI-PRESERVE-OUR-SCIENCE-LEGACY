Techniques that are being used to enhance our ability to characterize the global distribution of aerosol properties include well-calibrated multispectral radiometers, multispectral polarimeters, and multi-angle spectroradiometers. Though most of these sensor systems rely primarily on visible to mid-infrared spectral channels, the availability of thermal channels to aid in cloud screening is an important additional piece of information that is not always incorporated into the sensor design. In this paper, we describe the various satellite sensor systems being developed by Europe, Japan, and the U.S., and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each of these systems for aerosol applications. An important underlying theme is that the remote sensing of aerosol properties, especially aerosol size distribution and single scattering albedo, is exceedingly difficult. As a consequence, no one sensor system is capable of providing totally unambiguous information, and hence a careful intercomparison of derived products from different sensors, together with a comprehensive network of ground-based sunphotometer and sky radiometer systems, are required to advance our quantitative understanding of global aerosol characteristics.", "title": "EOS Science Plan and EOS Science Plan Executive Summary", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T08:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990079770, "meta": {"author": {"name": "King, Michael D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "da6302869b4043538a912c39555d2d3c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19990079770, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kaufman, Y.
