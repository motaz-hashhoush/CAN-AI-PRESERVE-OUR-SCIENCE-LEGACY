Material properties and impact cratering dominate the shaping of these objects. Long fragmentation histories can produce a variety of internal structures, but so far there is no direct evidence that any small satellite is an equilibrium ellipsoid made up of noncohesive gravitationally bound rubble. One many bodies that orbit close to their primary the tidal and rotational components of surface gravity strongly affect the directions of local g and thereby affect the redistribution of regolith by mass wasting. Downslope movement of regolith is extensive on Deimos, and is probably effective on many other small satellites. It is shown that in some cases observed patterns of downslope mass wasting cold produce useful constraints on the satellite's mean density. The diversity of features seen in the few high-resolution images of small satellites currently available suggests that these objects have undergone complex histories of cratering, fragmentation, and regolith evolution.", "title": "Small satellites", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T03:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870036050, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Thomas, P."}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell Univ.", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "2830f465c22c4587b73e2a8df22d56f4"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19870036050, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Veverka, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell Univ.", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "1d90356619e9433c9e2a2b012362da82"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19870036050, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dermott, S."}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell University", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "73476e74c7574496b9df66ab9ec05ecb"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870036050, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870036050, "id": "383d61b683ed45bf8307d2b7f6e33a23", "publicationDate": "1986-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
