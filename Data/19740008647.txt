b'PERCY THOMAS WIND GENERATOR DESIGNS\nCharles W. Lines\nFederal Power Commission\nWashington, D. C. 20426\nFor the benefit of all present, I would like to begin with a general description of the organization and responsibilities of the Federal\nPower Commission. The Federal Power Commission is a federal regulatory\nbody, administering the National Gas Act and the Federal Power Act, and\nis comprised of five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate and supported by a staff, which includes members\nof all professions and activities - legal, engineering, economic, and\nmany others.\nAs such, the Federal Power Commission has no responsibility,\nauthority, or funds for any research and development activity. It,\nnevertheless, remains interested in all these activities and does contribute indirectly to the advancement of the art and science. Through\nthe Uniform System of Accounts (the reports made to the Commission\nabout the cost and expenditures of regulated industry and its actions\nthrough rule-making processes and hearings) the Commission can give encouragement to the regulated industry. One such example is allowing\nfor the cost of research and development activity in the determination\nof allowable consumer rates (that is, wholesale rates) so that the costs\nmay be recovered by the utility which makes the expenditure. The Commission and its staff is also interested in any development that would affect, of course, the various aspects of reliability, adequacy, economics,\nand things of that nature.\nBut I would emphasize that anything I say that might be construed\nas an opinion is mine and not that of the Commission. Any Commission\nactivities always are a result of hearings in rate, or similar, cases,\nor are produced in the form of orders made public and followed by\nindustry.\nMr. Thomas devoted about 10 years, in addition to his other duties,\nto a detailed analysis of wind power electric generation and its effect\non the electric utility industry. He actually produced, and they were\npublished by the Commission, four monographs, the first one was titled\n"Electric Power from the Wind" (March 1945). (Notes on these monographs\nappear at the end of this paper.) This first monograph was prompted by\nthe 1941 to 1945 construction and operation of the 1,250-kilowatt installation on Grandpa\'s Knob near Rutland, Vermont, which we have just seen.\nThis installation was integrated with the Central Vermont Public Service\nCorporation, and, as we know, it suffered fatigue in blade failure.\n11\n\nAs Mr. Smith and Mr. Wilcox have advised, it was not rebuilt because of\neconomic considerations.\nNow, Mr. Thomas envisioned wind power electric generation for use\non interconnected utility networks firmed up by hydroelectric storage\nfacilities in order to overcome the firm power deficiencies of wind\ndriven generators. He used to a great extent the economic data from the\nGrandpaTs Knob operation, and he concluded that between 5,000 and 10,000\nkilowatts were necessary for economic viability.\nIn the first monograph, he described the twin wheeled, two bladed\npropeller design for a 7500-kilowatt unit and a twin wheeled, three\nbladed propeller design for a 6500-kilowatt unit. In order to overcome,\nin part, the difficulty in coupling a variable speed, wind driven mechanical source to a synchronous speed, alternating current commercial system,\nMr. Thomas* design proposed a wind driven, direct current generator,\nelectrically coupled to a dc to ac synchronous converter. He calculated\nthe cost, based on extrapolations and estimates from Grandpa\'s Knob, to\nbe $68 per kilowatt capacity for the 7500-kilowatt unit and $75 per\nkilowatt capacity for the 6500-kilowatt unit. Mr. Thomas concluded that\nwith certain assumptions the economics warranted the collection of wind\ndata in greater detail and specifity than that then accomplished. He\nalso suggested testing propeller designs in wind tunnels over and above\nthat done, and, in addition, the necessity of constructing a full-size\n7500-kilowatt prototype.\nI would like to emphasize that in not only Mr. Thomas\' first work\nbut the three that succeeded it, and probably in all the works and\ntreatises of people writing in the same area, that there is almost universal agreement that wind data including duration curves be acquired\nover a very wide area.\nIn March of 1946, the second monograph was published. It is devoted primarily to the detailed design features of the twin-wheel 7500and 6500-kilowatt wind powered generators he discussed, in general, in\nthe previous monograph. He commented on the March 1945 shutdown of the\nGrandpa\'s Knob installation and reiterated the desirability of larger\nunits, between 5,000 and 10,000 kilowatts for utility operation.\nIn January 1949 the third monograph was published. In it Mr. Thomas\ncompared the detailed aerodynamic designs of the Grandpa\'s Knob unit, an\nEnglish designed unit, and his design. It\'s interesting that in this\nmonograph Mr. Thomas modified, for comparison purposes, his 19 M6 design\nof the. 7500-kilowatt unit by increasing the blades from two to three for\neach wheel, shortening each blade, and increasing the designed rotational\nspeed. In all cases the general overall height of Mr. Thomas\' design\napproximated that at Grandpa\'s Knob, though it has been postulated and he\nmentioned designs that might go up as high as the Eiffel Tower or the\nWashington Monument, 500 or 600 feet. In this third monograph Mr. Thomas\nagain emphasized that, because of intangible characteristics and uncertainties of extrapolation, wind tunnel tests and full scale prototype\n12\n\nconstruction were imperative to efficient design.\nIn February 1954 the last of Mr. Thomas\' works was published. In\nthis last work Mr. Thomas digressed from the detailed technical design\nfeatures that he dealt with in his first three works. This work is\nlargely general in nature, commenting on utilization or integration of\nwind generated electric energy in an electric utility network. He discussed generally the possible benefits of firm and secondary power, derived from wind power generation, when supported by large interconnected\nelectric systems. By this time steam electric generating units having\n250,000-kilowatt capacities were in operation, and the economic benefits\nof economy of scale of these units presented at that time a stiff challenge to competing electric generation sources. Mr. Thomas moved away\nfrom comparative cost base justification for windpower generation in\nfavor of more general statements. In other words, windpower electric\ngeneration would be justified if the cost would be no greater than that\nthen being produced by modern steam plants. So, if I may insert\nat this time from my readings of the literature that you can find today,\nthere are no real good present day costs that one can put a handle on to\nmake an economic comparison. Mr. Thomas also stated, regarding wind\npowered electric generation, and this is to a degree at variance with\nhis earlier implications, that economies of scale were a questionable\nattainment and implied that capacities of 2,000 to 4,000 kilowatts might\nyield maximum economic benefits. He had moved away from the 5 to 10,000\nkilowatt installations, and there is no reason given why he made his\nstatements in what he had written. But he did say that the 2,000 to\n4,000 kilowatt units might be a maximum size. Again the implication is\nthat there is a lot of study needed in an economic way.\nI believe that no one in this room, or no one with any construction\nbackground whatsoever, would question the technical feasibility of constructing a windpowered electric generator. We have actually seen one\nwork, and the fact that the blade suffered that failure is really no\ncriticism, since in development activities things of that nature happen\nall the time. But even today there is a lack in economic justification\nfor the use of the wind as a source of energy.\nIn his previous publications Mr. Thomas made some reference to the\nuse of windmills to generate mechanical power, not necessarily associated\nwith conversion to electric energy. In this last work he also commented\non a windpowered waterpump and some general applications, including its\nuse as a pumping source for hydroelectric pump storage operations.\nThat, essentially, gentlemen, constitutes the works of Mr. Thomas.\nThey were rather lengthy, and in deference to the program I have abstracted them briefly and the abstracts are given at the end of this paper.\nI might comment from my own reading that, while it is technically\nfeasible to construct such a plan and to integrate it into a central\nstation operation, in the economic evaluation of any generating source\ntwo main costs must be borne in mind. One is the cost of the fuel, which\n\n13\n\nis a production cost for the energy so generated, electric energy. In\nthe case of wind it essentially is nothing; therefore, it enjoys that\nadvantage. Now, because of the nature of electric energy and its use by\nthe consumer it does not allow, in general, a storage of that energy\nexcept in an indirect form. It can be stored in hydroelectric storage;\nit can be stored in fuels which then are called on in accordance with\nthe demand of the customer. That is the serious defect in getting a\ngood, firm power worth to electric generation if it\'s merely integrated\ninto an operating system. And it appears, from what I have seen, the\ncosts are the biggest obstacle to overcome to the adequate use of this\nsource.\nDISCUSSION\nQ:\n\nA:\n\nYou mentioned there were two costs. One thing that I didn\'t detect\nin your comment was the cost of eliminating the traces that had made\nthe power, or to use the word "pollution." Do you see this becoming\na factor, or do you see a shortage in fuels becoming a factor that\nwould influence the balance of economic trade -off for this power?\nWe are very aware of the economic cost of environmental controls on\nmethods of generating electricity. In the end the consumer, the\npurchaser of the energy, will be the one who actually determines\nwhat steps are taken in these regards.\nWe have coal resources that can be exploited for all the foreseeable\nenergy needs until such times as our breeder nuclear reactor program,\nor our fusion program, or anything else comes into being. So what\nwe are really asking, are we not, is what will we pay in an intermediate time period for the home environmental freedom that windpower offers?\nNow,even though there is nothing in the sense of air pollution or\nwater pollution that windpower generation implies, it does require\ncertain land uses, and there are certain esthetic aspects of mile\nafter mile of windmills scattered over the landscape. Those are\nenvironmental costs also. But, to answer your question, I think the\nconsuming public by the cost of what they buy will be the eventual\ndecider of what environmental degradation they will stand.\nThere is another thing, too. We are prone to, I think, attribute\ntoo great an advantage to some things and consider that the money\nsupply is inexhaustible. After all, money is a resource and does\ncome from production and other efforts, and if we waste money, then\nwe are implying a resource waste in other areas.\n\nQ:\nA:\n\nCould you tell me where I could get these four pamphlets?\nThey have long been out of print. I have four copies, which are\nactually the file copies. The Office of Information of the Federal\nPower Commission can arrange to have them reproduced.\n\nQ:\n\nWhat are your impressions on the subject of storage, not just on the\n\nA:\n\nwind energy system, but the solar energy system?\nWhenever I look at pumping energy into the electric utilities system,\nI relate it really in terms of the proportion of windpower that could\nbe supplied in proportion to the total power output of the utility.\nIf the proportion of windpower is relatively small, I really don\'t\nsee the need for storage, because you have basically three systems\nin the utility where the intermediate and backing systems essentially\ncan perform the storage function. Obviously, if a large proportion\nof wind energy is being pumped into the utility, then is there a\nstorage problem. I disagree that carte blanche storage is a problem.\nIt depends on how much of the energy is being supplied.\nThere is a cyclical value to energy produced in the electric utility\noperation; in other words, the cost of energy varies second by second.\nThe economic computers that load and unload the various components of\ngeneration are so programmed that they evaluate the incremental cost\nof energy as it\'s produced on cyclical basis.\nIf I might use a rather basic evaluation, if you are generating\nunder pump-hydro, or even run-of-the-river hydro, that has a nonline\nat the time worth of 2 mills, then any energy produced by wind\npower will not" have a higher value in the planning phase.\n\nQ:\n\nA:\nQ:\n\nA:\n\nDo you have any information on the attempt to get money to build a\nlarger prototype in 1951? I have a copy of the Congressional Record\nin which the hearing was reported, but I have not been able to get\nany information on what happened in that attempt.\nI have no other information except the hearing record myself.\nI was wondering if Mr. Smith had any comments to say in collaboration\nwith the Federal Government. Were there ever any attempts to work\nwith Mr. Thomas of the FPC?\nWe had a good many sessions. We came to New York very frequently\nand discussed this with Mr. Thomas. The problem Mr. Thomas had was\nthat his economic evaluations were rather broad.\n\nCOMMENT: I am manager of a municipal light plant in Massachusetts.\nWith regards to the economics and to energy storage, let me say that, at\nthe time that these wind generators were being made the total demand for\nelectric energy was quite different than it is today.\nFor example, total electric living was not being pushed to as great\ndegree at that time. Today they are pushing a total electric home, as\nan example. In the total electric home, your greatest need is for heat,\nalmost 70 percent.\nTherefore, the greatest potential of th e wind generator is to generate\nheat directly, not to go to electricity and then make heat. The efficiencies of a direct conversion from mechanical to heat energy, such as\nin our community, are greatest when it is the coldest. That\'s when the\nwind is blowing the hardest and all the heat is blown out of the buildings,\n\n15\n\nand therefore we would have a direct need at that time for the greatest\namount of heat and a peak demand for electrical needs.\nThis appears to have significance. I mean heat storage is becoming a\ngreat thing - using heat exchanges, heat pumps, and storing up by water\nin tanks for big commercial buildings - all of this in order to combat\nthe problems. If you buy power on peak, the cost of power is greater\nthan off peak, so all these things figure into peaking and storage which\nis being substantially pushed already to reduce the demand costs.\n\nThe following are abstracts of Percy H. Thomas\' four monographs which\nwere the results of his studies on the potentialities of wind power.\nELECTRIC POWER FROM THE WIND\nMarch 1945\nPercy H. Thomas\nFederal Power Commission\nWashington, D. C.\nThis monograph by Mr. Thomas on the general subject of power from\nthe wind was prompted by the 1941-1945 construction and operation of a\n1,000-kilowatt installation at Grandpa\'s Knob near Rutland, Vermont, on\nthe system of the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation. This unit\nsuffered a blade failure on March 26, 1945, and was abandoned because of\neconomic considerations.\nMr. Thomas envisioned wind powered electric generation for use on\ninterconnected utility networks, firmed up by hydroelectric storage\nfacilities in order to overcome the firm power deficiencies of wind\ndriven generators. Using certain economic data from the Grandpa\'s Knob\noperation, the author concluded that units of a size between 5,000 and\n10,000 kilowatts were necessary for economic viability. The author described a twin-wheeled, two-bladed propeller design for a 7,500-kilowatt\nunit, and a twin-wheeled, three-bladed propeller design for a 6,500-kilowatt unit. In order to overcome in part the difficulty in coupling a\nvariable speed, wind-driven mechanical source to a synchronous speed\nalternating current commercial system, the design included a wind-driven,\ndirect-current generator electrically coupled to a dc to ac synchronous\nconverter. The author\'s calculated costs were $68 per kilowatt of capacity for the 7,500-kilowatt unit, and $75 per kilowatt for the 6,500kilowatt unit.\nMr. Thomas concluded that, with certain assumptions, the economics\nwarranted the collection of wind data in greater detail and specificity\nthan that then accomplished, the testing of propeller designs in wind\ntunnels, and the construction of a full size (7,500 kW) prototype.\n\n16\n\nTHE WIND POWER AEROGENERATOR \xe2\x80\x94 TWIN WHEEL TYPE\nMarch 1946\nPercy H. Thomas\nFederal Power Commission\nWashington, D. C.\nThis monograph is devoted to the detailed design features of the\ntwin wheel, 7,500- and 6,500-kilowatt wind powered generators discussed\nin the previous monograph.\nThe author commented on the March 1945 shutdown of the 1,000-kilowatt\nGrandpa\'s Knob unit, and he reiterated the desirability of larger units\nhaving capacities between 5,000 and 10,000 kilowatts for utility operation.\n\n*\n\nAERODYNAMICS OF THE WIND TURBINE\nJanuary 1949\nPercy H. Thomas\nFederal Power Commission\nWashington, D. C.\nIn this monograph, the author compares the detailed aerodynamic designs of the Grandpa\'s Knob unit, an English design, with his design.\nMr. Thomas modified his 1946 design of a 7,500-kilowatt unit for this\ncomparison by increasing the blades from two to three for each wheel,\nshortening each blade, and increasing the designed rotational speed.\nMr. Thomas again emphasized that, because of intangible characteristics and uncertainties of extrapolations, wind tunnel tests and full\nscale prototype construction were imperative to fix a design.\n\n17\n\nFITTING WIND POWER TO THE UTILITY NETWORK\nFebruary 1954\nPercy H. Thomas\nFederal Power Commission\nWashington, D. C.\nThis is the last of the four monographs published by the Federal\nPower Commission relative to the studies made by Mr. Thomas in the 19441954 period regarding wind powered electric generation.\nThe author\'s prior works involved highly technical and specific design matters, particularly in the field of aerodynamics. This shorter\nwork was largely general in nature, commenting on the utilization, or\nintegration, of wind generated electric energy in an electric utility\nnetwork. He discussed generally the possible benefits of firm and secondary power derived from wind powered generation when supported by\nlarge interconnected electric systems. By this time, steam-electric\ngenerating units having 250,000-kilowatt capacities were in operation,\nand the economic benefits of economy of scale of these units presented,\nat that time, a stiff challenge to competing electric generation sources.\nIn this monograph, Mr. Thomas moved away from comparative cost based justification for wind powered generation in favor of more general statements; i.e., justification would be sufficient if steam generation costs\nwere met. He also stated, regarding wind powered electric generation\nand to a degree at variance with earlier implications, that economies of\nscale were of questionable attainment, and he implied that units having\n2,000- to 4,000-kilowatt capacities might yield maximum economic benefits.\nIn previous publications, Mr. Thomas had made some references to the\nuse of wind mills to generate mechanical power, not necessarily associated\nwith conversion to electric energy. In this work, he also commented on\na wind-powered water pump and some general applications, including its\nuse as the pumping source for hydroelectric pumped storage operations.\n\n18\n\n'
