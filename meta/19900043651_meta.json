The analyst must be satisfied with the constraints that are intrinsic to any combination of solution technique and model abstraction. To get a better idea of the nature of these constraints, three reliability analysis tools (HARP, ASSIST/SURE, and CAME) were used to model portions of the Integrated Airframe/Propulsion Control System architecture. When presented with the example problem, all three tools failed to produce correct results. In all cases, either the tool or the model had to be modified. It is suggested that most of the difficulty is rooted in the large model size and long computational times which are characteristic of Markov model solutions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 19900043651, "endDate": "1989-05-26T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "c89d4cba478b520a8c47b5bcac2f6911", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "Piscataway, New Jersey, United States"}}, "meetingId": "29dd9da15f004aadbcdcdacf575168b0", "id": "389504caf2bb45058841eba3b21464f6"}], "name": "IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON 89)", "location": "Dayton, OH", "id": "29dd9da15f004aadbcdcdacf575168b0", "startDate": "1989-05-22T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900043651, "publisher": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "id": "f2ccaf23b32248ab864902949e651921", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference", "publicationDate": "1989-05-22T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "doi": "10.1109/NAECON.1989.40229"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
