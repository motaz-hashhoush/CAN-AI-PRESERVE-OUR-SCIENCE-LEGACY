b'Small Business Innovations\n\nI\n\nIndustrial Productivity and Manufacturing Technology\n\nhown below is a Series 140 single frequency laser\nproduced by Lightwave Electronics Corporation,\nMountain View, California. It is a new member of a\nfamily of laser systems based on technology originally\ndeveloped under a NASA Small Business Innovation\nResearch (SBIR) contract.\nThe original contract with Jet Propulsion Laboratory\ncalled for development of a prototype laser-diode-pumped\nsolid state transmitter. Lightwave delivered a low noise\nring laser with wavelength tuning that could be used as a\n\nlocal oscillator in an optical communications network.\nThe wavelength tuning feature allows "phase locking" two\nlasers, generating electronic frequencies, in the manner\nof radio and microwave electronic oscillators.\nFrom this technology, Lightwave developed the commercial Series 120/122, Series 123 and the Series 140\nlasers, which have applications in fiber optic communications, difference frequency generation, fiber optic sensing\nand general laboratory use. They feature a patented resonator design known a s NPRO (nonplanar ring oscillator).\n\nThe combination of NPRO and laser diode pumping, says\nLightwave, offers "greater reliability, smaller size and\nsuperior performance compared to conventional lamppumped products."\nEstablished by Congress in 1982, the SBIR program\nis designed to increase small business participation in\nfederal high technology R&D activities and to stimulate\nconversion of government-funded research into commercial application; it has generated spinoff applications in\nabout one of every three projects approved for funding\nfrom proposals submitted by small businesses.\nA second example of an SBIR spinoff is the Phase\nDoppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) developed by\nAerometrics, Inc., Sunnyvale, California a s an offshoot to\nan SBIR contract with Lewis Research Center. The PDPA,\nshown above conducting a spray characterization test, is\na non-disruptive, highly accurate laser-based method of\ndetermining particle size, number density, trajectory, turbulence and other information about particles passing\nthrough a measurement probe volume. The system\nconsists of an optical transmitter and receiver, a signal\nprocessor and a computer with software for data acquisitlon and analysis.\nVelocity and size data are inferred from particles\nthat are carried within the flow field being studied.\nVeloclty profiles are obtained by analyzing the Doppler\ndifference frequency of light scattered by particles passing through the intersection of two laser beams. Particle\ndiameter is determined by measuring the phase difference\nbetween three detectors positioned a known distance from\neach other.\nAerometrics offers a variety of PDPA systems for different applications. A major application is spray characterization for various sprays and spray generators, such\na s paint, agricultural, fire sprinkler and fuel sprays; electrohydrodynamic flows; atomizers and spray nozzles. The\nPDPA also has utility in combustion, aerodynamic and\nunderwater research studies.\n\nA related product stemming from the same SBIR\nwork is Aerometrics\' Microsizer (above),an adaptation\nof PDPA technology for medical equipment manufacturing\nand analysis of small sprays, nebulizers, aerosols, mists\nand other contained flows. Developed for a customer producing metered dose inhalers (MDIs), the Microsizer provides discrimination between propellant and medicine by\ndetermining the size of particles emitted and their concentrations, information important to quality assurance.\nA third example of SBIR commercialization is the\nwork of Millitech Corporation, South Deerfield,\nMassachusetts. Millitech specializes in high frequency\ncomponents and subsystems operating in the upper portion of the millimeter wave (MMW) frequency range, from\n30 to 700 gigahertz; this is an area where the commercial\nstate of the art is limited and Millitech has focused on this\narea to carve a business niche by developing a broad line\nof high performance, readily-available products.\nMillitech has conducted a number of NASA SBIR projects, principally with Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and this\nwork has generated several commercial MMW products; a\nsampling is shown at right. Millitech considers its most\nimportant contributions to be in\nquasi-optical components and\nactive components. In particular, the company has advanced\nthe state of the art in sensitive\nreceiver technology by developing very high performance mixers and multipliers.\nAlthough the principal\nmarket is the scientific research\ncommunity, Millitech high frequency components are finding\npractical applications beyond\nlaboratory use. They are generally used in receivers and transceivers for such applications a s monitoring chlorine\nmonoxide, ozone, water vapor and other atmospheric\ncompounds; in radioastronomy; in plasma characterization: and in material properties characterization.\n\n'
