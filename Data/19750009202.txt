Appleton and\nHey, 1946).\n\nIn his book on the historical review of the development of radio\n\nastronomy, he has described the story of his discovery of these continuums (Hey,\n1972).\n\nDuring the period mentioned above, a large sunspot group in the northern\n\nhemisphere, accompanying these continuums, was very active and produced solar proton\nflares twice, from which Bev-energy particles were ejected on 28 February and\n7 March (see Lange and Forbush, 1942; Forbush, 1946).\nSince the end of World War II, the Australian group, headed by Bolton,\ninitiated the research on solar radio astronomy with galactic radio astronomy.\nBased -on the -early research results, Wild -(951, 1957) proposed.a classification\nsystem on various aspects and characteristics of solar radio emissions, which\nmainly defines three groups of characteristic radio emissions, called the bursts\nof spectral types I, II,and III.\n\nThe radio noise continuums observed by Hey are\n\nclassified as type I burst storms, although the characteristics of these storms\nwere sometimes considered to be different from isolated bursts of type I (see\nPawsey and Smerd, 1953; Wild, 1957).\n\nHowever, it is very likely that these\n\nbursts are produced as a result of superposition of many type I burst emissions,\nsince the observed characteristics of these bursts are very similar to those of\ntype I bursts (e. g., Kundu, 1965; Zheleznyakov, 1970).\n.As well known, these noise continuum storm sources are generally\nassociated with sunspot groups fully developed as classified to the E and F types\n\n-3-\n\n(Fokker, 1960, 1965).\n\nThe characteristics of these storms and their relation to\n\nthe passage of associated active sunspot groups were first investigated by Boischot\n(1958) using the observational results from the Nancey interferometer at 169\nMHz.\n\nHis results indicate that these sources are usually associated with sunspot\n\ngroups well-developed, and that they are located somewhere above or close to\nthese groups.\n\nIn this case, it should be noted that, because of their narrow\n\nemission directivity, the flux intensity from these radio sources is not high\nwhile they are located near the limb of the solar disk (see Fokker, 1965).\nRecent observations at Culgoora, -Australia, at both 80 and 160 MHz show\nthat these noise continuum storms are generally of composites of two oppositely\npolarized sources usually located adjacent to each other (Kai, 1970; Wild, 1970;\nKai and Sheridan, 1973).\n\nThe polarization-of these sources well reflects the\n\ndirection of sunspot magnetic fields ambient in these sources.\n\nFurthermore, the\n\nobservational results suggest that these noise continuum storms are generated by\nsome mechanism related to plasma processes since the emission region of these\ntwo frequencies (e.g., Kai and Sheridan, 1973; Dulk and Nelson, 1973).\n\nAlthough\n\nwe have not known yet what mechanism can generate these noise.storms, it is\nvery likely that energetic electrons of 10 - 100 Key are mainly responsible for the\nexcitation of plasma waves, which is transformed into electromagnetic waves due\nto some non-linear plasma processes as discussed by Ginzburg and Zheleznyakov\n(1958), Takakura (1963), Trakhtengerts (1966) and Tsytovich (1966, 1967).\nidea has been sophisticated by theoretical works of Melrose (1970 a, b) and\n\n-4-\n\nThis\n\nSmith (1970 a, b, 1972, 1973), in relation to their consideration on type III bursts.\nIt seems that the formation of energetic electron bemns and their instability due\nto the interaction with ambient plasmas play a very important role in generating\nnoise continuum storms.\n\nAlthough this formation seems to be closely related\n\nto energyzation mechanism of ambient electrons and the processes of bunching\naccelerated electrons, it is certain that this energyzation occurs independently\nfrom solar flare activity, as shown by Fokker (1965).\n\nHowever, our recent\n\nresults suggest that efficient generation of energetic electrons is closely tied up\nwith the growth of associated sunspot groups into complex types such as / y and\nY\n\n(Sakurai, 1974).\n\nThis suggests that these electrons are accelerated as a\n\nresult of instabilities associated with sunspot magnetic configurations.\nThe emission bandwidth of these noise continuum storms was first thought\n-as limited to-very"narrow one \'such as 10 MHz wide (e.g., Kundu, 1965).\n\nHowever,\n\nrecent observations show that the emission frequencies of these storms are often\nextended into decametric frequencies (e. g., Warwick, 1965) and sometimes farther\ninto hectometric frequencies (e. g.,\n\nFainberg and Stone, 1971), although this\n\nnarrow-band characters seem to be maintained with respect to each observed\nfrequency.\n\nThese observations, therefore, suggest that energetic electrons are\n\nejected high up into the solar corona by exciting plasma waves which are determined\nby the distribution of the density of the electrons ambient in the outer solar corona.\nIn this case, it seems important to point out that the same electron beams are\npossibly responsible for the generation of such wide-band continuum emissions from\nmetric to hectometric wave frequencies (e.g., Sakurai, 1973).\n\n-5-\n\nIn this paper, a review is given on various problems as discussed above\nwith the aim to summarize the current status on the research for solar radio\ncontinuum emissions from metric to hectometric wave frequencies.\n\nIn so doing,\n\nthe role of energetic electrons is extensively considered in relation to the\nmechanism of these continuum emissions.\n\nA theoretical model is briefly considered\n\nto interpret the observational characteristics of these emissions.\n\n-6-\n\n2.\n\nProperties of Radio Continuum Storms\n\nIn order to study the development of these radio noise continuum storms, it\nis necessary to find out young active regions which have become active in these\nstorm emissions since they were newly born on the visible disk within fifty\ndegrees east in solar longitude.\n\nIf not so, it is impossible to study how these\n\nstorm sources are developed in association with the growth of active sunspot\ngroups and other associated phenomena.\n\nSince these sunspot groups are\n\ngenerally accompanied by flares and other active phenomena, it is possible to\nstudy the relation of the noise continuum storms with these active phenomena.\n\nIn\n\nparticular, it is interesting to find out how these storms are related to other\nradio phenomena such as the S-component of microwave emissions in their\n-developmental phase; it-seems-that the S-component -emissions are causatively\nrelated to the development of these noise storm sources (e.g., Kai and Sekiguchi,\n1973).\nWe here pick up the solar radio phenomena observed during the period from\n3 to 15 May, 1971 in order to study the relation mentioned above in association\nwith the development of the active region MacMath No. 11294.\n\nThis active\n\nregion became active in the emission of noise continuum storms in metric and\ndecametric wave frequencies on 6th of May.\n\nThe activity of this emission\n\nsharply increased on 7th of this month, one day after the beginning of this emission\n(see Fig. 1).\n\nIn Fig. 1, we show the daily flux values of both metric continuum\n\n(200 MHz) and S-component (2800 MHz) emissions.\n\n-7-\n\nThese data are obtained from\n\nthe Quarterly Bulletin of Solar Activity (1971).\n\nThe result shown in this figure\n\nindicates that the sharp increase of the metric continuum flux is delayed about\na day from that of the S-component flux.\n\nIt should be remarked that this sharp\n\nincrease shown in Fig. 1 is accompanied by the very high activity on type Ill\nbursts in decametric frequencies (Gergely, 1974).\n\nFurthermore, it is interesting\n\nto note that this sharp increase also seemed to be related to the growth of the\nsunspot group into the PY type, which is the one of very complex configuration of\nof these groups (Fig. 1).\n\nIn fact, as shown in Fig. 2, the flux intensity of metric\n\ncontinuum storm emissions tends to sharply increase just after associated sunspot\ngroups become the complex configurations like fy\n\ntype.\n\nIn this figure, we show\n\ntwo cases associated with the sunspot groups MacMath Nos. 11294 and 12094.\nThe latter was observed on the solar disk for 18 to 30 of October, 1971.\n\nIts\n\ndevelopmental pattern of radio emission activity in both metric and microwave\nfrequencies is almost the same as that of the region MacMath No. 1.1294.\n\nAs\n\nclearly seen in Fig. 2, the sharp increase of metric continuum storm emission\ntends to occur just after an associated sunspot group becomes the configuration of\nPYtype.\n\nIt is also clear that, for first several days, the activity of metric noise\n\ncontinuum storm is very low and almost constant, while the activity of microwave\nS-component emission tends to increase very sharply (Fig. 2).\n\nThis fact suggests\n\nthat the growth of the sources for the S-component emissions is very important\nfor the birth of the source of metric noise continuums.\nIn order to find out the statistical relation between the developments of\nboth metric continuum and microwave S-component emissions, it seems\nreasonable to study the,time delay from the maximum activity of S-component\n\n-8-\n\nemissions to that of metric noise continuum emissions by taking into account the\nThese time delays are analyzed for the\n\ndaily flux values for both these emissions.\n\nperiod 1969-1972 and are indicated in Fig. 3.\n\nThis result shows that the maximum\n\nflux intensity of metric continuum emissions is mainly reached within a day after\nthe S-component emissions attain maximum.\n\nThis suggests that the growth of the\n\nsource of S-component emissions is considered as an important precursor of the\ndevelopment of metric noise continuum storms.\n\nFurthermore, it may be said that\n\nthe birth and growth of metric continuum storm sources is closely associated\nwith these of microwave S-component emissions; that is, metric continuum sources\ndo not grow independently from microwave S-component sources, though such\nindependence was once suggested (see Fokker, 1965).\nThe result shown in Fig. 3, further, suggests that the growth of the sources\nfor microwave S-tomponent emission tends to induce that of metric noise continuum\nsources.\n\nThis relation was once suggested by Kai and Sekiguchi (1973), but our\n\nresult shown above indicates that the change of sunspot groups into complex\ntypes is very important in forming metric noise continuum storm sources.\nGergely (1974) has found that type III burst activity at decametric wave frequencies\nassociated with metric noise continuum emissions was highest on.7th of May 1971,\nalthough this activity was observed between 3rd and 13th of this month.\nactivity is schematically shown in Fig. 4.\n\nThis\n\nDuring this period, the IMP-6 satellite\n\nwas also observing solar radio emissions, and detected many type III bursts in\nhectometric and kilometric wave frequencies.\n\nAlthough the data obtained by\n\nthis satellite were not good in quality during the period from 7 to 9 of May, we\n\n-9-\n\nmay say that the type III burst activity in these low frequencies was delayed by\na few days in comparison with this activity in decametric wave frequencies (Fig. 4).\nThis delay may be related to the further growth of the sunspot group MacMath\nNo. 11294 during its passage over the solar disk.\n\nAs suggested by Kai and\n\nSekiguchi (1973), this delay may be explained by considering an outward expansion\nmotion of sunspot magnetic field lines of arch-like configuration, since the\nfield intensity and background plasma density are both decreased with this motion.\nIn fact, this arch-like configuration extending farther out, was deduced by Gergely\n(1974).\n\nThis configuration calculated by Trotter et al (1973) was here indicated\n\nin Fig. 5.\n\nThe sources of radio emissions with wide-band frequencies from\n\nmicrowave to decametric waves, really speaking, were all confined in this extended\narch-like structure of sunspot magnetic fields.\n\nThe sources for type III bursts,\n\nespecially, "on-fringe" type III bursts were located above this structure (Gergely,\n1974).\nAs shown in Fig. 2, it is clear that the activity of metric noise continuum sources\nsharply increases when the type of associated sunspot groups grows into complex\ntypes as /3 y and Y..\n\nFokker (1965) analyzed the relation between sunspot types\n\nand the activity of these sources and found that the sunspot groups classified as\nE and F types (the Zurich Classification) are most active on the formation of these\nradio sources.\n\nIn the analysis of the metric continuum noise storm sources\n\nobserved in July to August, 1967, which was associated with the active region\nMacMath No. 8905, Sakurai.(1971 a) found that the development of the storm source\nwas not related to the flare activity associated with this active region.\n\n-10-\n\nThese\n\nresults, therefore, suggest that the generation of the energetic electrons\n(10 - 100 Kev) responsible for those radio emissions is independent from flare\nactivity (Skaurai, 1971 a).\nThe relation of the low-frequency continuum storms with energetic electron streams\ndetected at the earth\'s orbit was first shown by Sakurai (1973) on the observations\nfor the period October to November, 1968.\n\nTlhis result suggests that these\n\nelectron streams are responsible for the excitation of radio noise continuum\nstorms from metric to hectometric wave frequencies.\n\nSimilar observation was\n\nmade for the period 10 - 26 August, 1968 (Fainberg and Stone, 1970, 1971;\nSakurai, 1971 b).\n\nThe changing patterns of both metric and hectometric continuum\n\nstorm emissions were very similar for these two cases cited above.\n\nWe examined\n\nthe IMP-6 satellite records to find out some evidence on the continuum emissions\nin low\'frequencies during the period from 3 to 14 May, 1971.\n\nHowever, we did\n\nnot see any trend on the increase of background continuum storm emissions in\nthese frequencies.\n\nAlthough it seems that the active regions on metric noise\n\ncontinuum storm emissions tend to be accompanied by the sources of hectometric\ncontinuum storms (Stone and Fainberg, 1973; Fainberg and Stone, 1974), it seems\nnatural that these continuum storms are not often observed because of diverging\ntendency of these sources, which is closely associated with an expansive nature\nof sunspot magnetic field lines above active regions.\nRadio waves emitted from the sources of these noise continuum storms are\nusually polarized in circular modes.\n\nIt seems that the modes of polarization are\n\nstrongly dependent on the distribution of sunspot magnetic fields identified as these\nsources.\n\nUsing the data obtained by the Culgoora radio heliograph, Kai and\n\n-11-\n\nSheridan (1973) have proposed a model on the source structure of noise continuum\nstorm emissions in two discrete wave frequencies (80 and 160 MHz).\n\nAccording\n\nto them, this structure is very important in explaining the observed features on\npolarization, both L-H and R-H waves, since these two polarization modes can be\nexplained by taking into account the polarity distribution of sunspot magnetic fields\naccompanying these radio sources.\n\nSeveral years ago, Kai (1970) found that there.\n\nexist double sources of these noise continuum emissions above sunspot groups,\nwhich are usually oppositely polarized, as schematically described in Fig. 6.\nThe results obtained by Kai and Sheridan (1973) also show that double sources,\noppositely polarized from each other, were observed.\n\nHowever, one of these\n\nsources is sometimes missing as found by Dulk and Nelson (1973).\n\nTheir\n\nresult indicates that this kind of absence may occur in accordance with the\nconfiguration of associated sunspot magnetic fields,\nFig. 6 schematically shows that energetic electrons released from\n-noise continuum source regions are mainly transported along magnetic field\nlines radially extending outward of these regions.\n\nThese electrons seem to be\n\nidentified as sources of type III burst storms (Kai, 1970).\n\nThese burst storms\n\nmay be identified as the "on-fringe" burst storms as found by Gergely (1974),\nfor the highest emission frequencies of these bursts are expected to be generally\nlower than the lowest emission frequencies of noise continuum emissions.\nFainberg and Stone (1970) found that, in August 1968, type III burst storm in\nlow frequencies was observed in association with the passage of the active\nregion MacMath No. 9597.\n\nIn this period, the activity of decametric continuum\n\n-12-\n\nemissions also was very high (Sakurai, 1971 b).\n\nIt seems that these type MI\n\nburst storms were produced by the passage of Kev electron streams in the outer\ncorona and the envelope of the sun.\n\nIn fact, these streams were observed during\n\n20 to 23 in August, 1968 while the active region mentioned above was on the\nwestern hemisphere, though the electron flux was not high (Lin, private communication, 1970).\n\nAs shown in Fig. 6, it seems that the electron streams\n\nreleased from the noise storm regions tend to move mainly along the neutral\nsheet which forms above the active regions (Wild and Weiss, 1964; Sakurai\nand Stone, 1971).\n\nSince it seems unlikely that this sheet is maintained in the\n\nregion far away from the active region, say more than 20 solar radii from the\nsun, it may be almost impossible to detect these electrons in any sector\nboundary observed at the earth\'s orbit.\n\nIn this respect, however, it should be\n\nnoted that these electrons are well controlled by the interplanetary magnetic\nfield lines during their propagation (e.g., Lin, 1970; Fainberg and Stone, 1974).\nAt present, noise continuum storm emissions and type III burst storms\nare thought to be generated by energetic electrons due to their interaction with\nambient plasmas.\n\nIn particular, the noise continuum storms are generated by\n\nthe electron streams continually emitted from the sun (Sakurai, 1971 b, 1973).\nA clear evidence has been shown in the period between 20 October and 4 November,\n1968; the time variation of Key electrons fluxes (>22 and 245 Kev) observed at\nthe earth\'s orbit was very similar to those of the noise continuum storm fluxes\nat metric and hectometric wave frequencies.\n\nA similar evidence, though not\n\nmuch clear, was found in August, 1968 (Sakurai, 1971 b; Stone and Fainberg, 1973).\n\n-13-\n\nThese evidences are important in considering theory to explain the emission\nmechanism of noise continuum storms of wide-band frequencies.\n\n-14-\n\n3.\n\nRelation to Type ImBurst Storms\n\nGergely (1974) has found that type III burst activity at decametric wave\nfrequencies was very high while the active region MacMath No. 11294 was on\ntransit over the solar disk.\n\nThis activity indicates that many type III bursts\n\nwere consecutively superposed and then may be said to be type III burst storms.\n\nThe\n\nhighest activity of this burst storm associated with the active region mentioned\nabove was observed on 7 May, 1971 when the type of the associated sunspot\ngroup changed to the py type (see the discussion in last chapter).\nThis sort of type III burst activity in hectometric wave frequencies was\nfirst discovered by Fainberg and Stone (1971), based on the analysis of the\nobservational data from the RAE-A satellite.\n-obtaned by them in Fig. 7,\n\nWe here show one of the results\n\n,In this figure, the data on metric continuum storm\n\nemissions at 200 MHz, observed at Hiraiso, Japan, is also shown.\n\nThese two\n\nresults in both metric and hectometric wave frequencies indicate that the\nchanging patterns of the radio fluxes in the two frequencies are very similar to\neach other except for small-scale variations in time.\nshown in\n\nFurthermore, the results\n\n\'ig. 7 suggests that the same source responsible for metric noise\n\ncontinuum storm emissions was extended into the outer corona around 10 to 20\nsolar radii away from the sun.\n\nDuring the period shown in Fig. 7, we also\n\nobserved continuum storms in decametric wave frequencies, 10 - 60 MHz, the\ndata of which were obtained at Boulder, Colorado (Malitson, 1969; see also,\nSakurai, 1971 b).\n\nThese continuum emissions, classified as type I noise continuum\n\n-15-\n\nstorm, are explained as a composite of many type III and type I bursts superposed\non type I continuum storms.\n\nSince these bursts are continually emitted, they\n\nseem to be really observed as if continuum storm emissions were generated in\nthe active region.\n\nHowever, this problem is not finally solved yet.\n\nThe relation between this type of noise continuum storm and type III bursts\nhas been investigated by several authors (e. g., Malville, 1962; Hanasz, 1966;\nWild and Tlamicha, 1964; Gordon, 1970; Gergely, 1974).\n\nThe analyzed results\n\nindicate that the starting frequencies of the emission of type III bursts, which are\nclassified as the "on-fringe" bursts (Gergely, 1974), is usually lower than the\nlowest emission frequencies of (Type I) noise continuum storms.\n\nIn fact, these\n\n"on-fringe" type III bursts are generated directly above associated active sunspot\ncomplexes (see Gergely, 1974).\nIn August, 1968, the noise continuum storm source was observed as shown\nin Fig. 7 and associated with low-frequency continuum storm (0.54 - 2.8 MHz),\nwhich seemed to be located higher up in the solar outer corona beyond 10 solar\nradii or more from the sun (Fainberg and Stone, 1970).\n\nThis continuum storm\n\nwas connected with a noise continuum storm (e. g., type I noise storm) in the\nfrequency range from metric to decametric waves as discussed here before\n(see Fig. 7 (b)).\n\nIn order to interpret this connection with these noise continuum\n\nstorm sources widely separated from each other, Sakurai (1971 b) and Stewart\nand Labrum (1972) have considered models of associated active regions and the\nconfiguration of magnetic fields extended out of these active regions.\n\n-16-\n\nBoth of\n\nthem discussed the relation between these low-frequency continuum storms and\ntype I noise sources observed in metric and decametric wave frequencies.\n\nStewart\n\net al (1972) have given a detailed discussion on this connection by referring to the\nradio data obtained by the Culgoora radio-heliograph.\nSince the time of the CMP of the noise continuum source at hectometric\nwave frequencies was delayed by about one day from that of the active region\nassociated with the noise continuum source at metric wave frequencies (Fainberg\nand Stone, 1970), it is concluded that the former source was not formed radially\nabove the latter source; this fact suggests that the source structure was tilted\neastward with the elevation of the radio source from the solar surface into the\nsolar outer corona.\nIn the case of the radio noise activity in May, 1971, the type III burst\nactivity in hectometric wave frequencies was observed by the IMP-6 satellite\n(Sakurai, 1974).\n\nAs shown by Gergely (1974), this activity in decametric wave\n\nfrequencies was observed during 4 to 14 of May.\n\nThe highest activity was found\n\non 7th of this month, but this activity in hectometric wave frequencies was very\nlow on this day.\n\nIn fact, the increase of this activity was found a few days after\n\n7th, and reached maximum around 9 and 10 of May. \'Such delay may have been\nresulted from the expanding motion of the associated active sunspot groups,\nalthough we need to examine many more events similar to that which has been\ncited here.\n\n-17-\n\n4.\n\nEmission Mechanism\n\nAs discussed in the last two chapters, Kev-energy electrons generated in\nactive sunspot groups must be the sources of radio continuum storm emissions for\nThese electrons seem to excite plasma oscillations in the\n\nwide frequency bands.\n\nmedium, through which they are passing.\n\nIt is noted that the frequency of these\n\noscillations is expressed as\n2\n\n2\n\n3kT\nm\n\n(4-1)\n\n2\n\nwhen the oscillations are excited in thermal plasmas.\n\nHere,\n\no ,\n\nop, k, T and\n\nm are, respectively, the wave and the plasma frequencies, the Boltzmann constant,\nthe temperature and the mass of electron.\noscillations.\n\nK is the wave number of plasma\n\nSince these oscillations consist of longitudinal waves only, it turns\n\nout that some mechanism must be found on the transformation from these waves\nto transverse waves, identified as electromagnetic waves, which are emitted into\nouter space.\n\nAlthough many theories have been proposed until now to find out\n\nthis mechanism, we may say that the fundamental process has first been\ndiscovered by Ginzburg and Zheleznyakov (1958,\n\n1961).\n\nThis process takes into\n\naccount the scattering of those longitudinal waves on the polarization clouds of\nions, i.e., electron density fluctuation, and is described as\np+i\n\n-\n\nt + i,\n\n(4-2)\n\nwhere p, t, i and i1 are, respectively, the longitudinal plasma waves, the transverse\n(electromagnetic) waves and the polarization clouds of ions before and after the\n\n-18-\n\ncollision with the longitudinal waves.\n\nIn this interaction, there is a possibility\n\nfor the transverse waves to be amplified as faras this interaction continues in\nthe medium (Smith, 1970 a, 1973).\nWe may, further, consider the emission mechanism of the second harmonic\nof transverse waves by taking into account the following interaction:\np+-p --\n\n(4-3)\n\nt (2 o p).\n\nHowever, this process does not seem important in the theory of radio noise\ncontinuum storm emissions, although this process is applied to explain the\nsecond harmonic observed in type III radio bursts (e. g., Kundu, 1965; Smith,\n1970 ay.\nIn the processes as described in eq. (4-2), we assume that Key electron\nstreams excite plasma waves oscillating with wave frequencies given by eq,\n(4-1).\n\nAs first pointed-outby.Sturrock .(1964), these plasma waves thus generated\n\ntend to grow without limit and then produce the two stream instability in the\nparent electron beams.\n\nGenerally speaking, these beams are, therefore, not\n\nmaintained stably while moving in the medium like the solar outer corona.\n\nIn\n\nfact, this instability is very serious in the theory of type III radio bursts (see\nSmith, 1970 a, b; Melrose, 1970 a, b; Papadopoulus et al, 1974).\n\nIn case of radio\n\ncontinuum noise storm emissions, this instability may be useful to explain the\ndispersive nature and other characteristics of these emissions.\n\nTakakura (1963)\n\nfirst found that the observed short duration of these emissions could be explained\nby taking into this instability associated with the electron beams, though not\nclearly mentioned.\n\nThe cause of this observed short duration seems to be closely\n\n-19-\n\nassociated with the instability observed on the electron beams or bunches if we\nrefer to the theoretical results by Melrose (1970 a)."\nIt is well known that radio noise continuum storm sources are usually\nassociated with type III burst activity observed above these sources (see the\ndiscussions in the last chapter).\n\nAs shown by Malville (1962) and Gergely (1974),\n\nthe starting emission frequencies of type III bursts (e. g., "on-fringe" bursts)\nare generally lower than the lowest frequencies of associated noise continuum\nstorm emissions.\n\nSince these bursts are mainly observed in the regions where\n\nsunspot magnetic field lines are distributed almost radially in direction, the configuration\nof these field lines may have some effects on the stabilization of electron beams\nreleased from the noise continuum source regions.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 5, these\n\ncontinuum sources are usually confined in the sunspot magnetic fields with archlike configuration (Gergely, 1974).\n\nThe contrast of magnetic field structures\n\nbetween continuum storm source regions and the regions in which "oi-fringe" type\nIII bursts are generated, must be considered in investigating the emission\nmechanisms of both noise continuums and type III bursts.\nSo far many theories have been proposed to interpret these mechanisms,\nbut none has considered the effect of ambient magnetic fields on the stability of\nelectron beams in the solar atmosphere above sunspot active regions, because\nof theoretical difficulty to include this effect.\n\nAs considered by Gordon (1970),\n\nthe stabilization of electron beams may be dependent on plasma parameters in\nthe region where plasma waves are excited, but the contrast mentioned above\nseems to give us a clue to find out some mechanism to stabilize the beams under\n\n-20-\n\nthe action of ambient sunspot magnetic fields.\nIt is known that type III burst storms are usually observed in the regions\nabove active sunspot groups associated with radio noise continuum storms in\nmetric or/and decametric wave frequencies (see the discussion in the last\nFurthermore, it is now believed that the energetic electrons responsible\n\nchapter).\n\nfor the emission of type m bursts are released from the regions where radio\nnoise storms are generated for these electrons are continually produced in active\nsunspot groups.\n\nAlthough we do not know how these electrons are released from\n\nnoise storm source regions, it seems likely that they are ejected out of these\nstorm source regions as a result of rapid variation of associated sunspot magnetic\nfield lines.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, type III burst activity was sharply increased\n\nwhen the type of associated sunspot group grew into the complex type classified\nas /3\n\n.\n\nThis result suggests that both efficiencies of generation of energetic\n\nelectrons and of their release are highly dependent on the growth oi associated\nsunspot groups.\nThe energetic electrons released from\n\noise continuum storm regions seem\n\nto propagate outward along sunspot magnetic field lines radially extending into the\nouter solar corona.\n\nWhile propagating, they would excite plasma waves with\n\nfrequencies given by eq. (4-1).\n\nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, these\n\nwaves are transformed into electromagnetic waves which are emitted as type III\nbursts into outer space.\n\nMost of energetic electrons, being trapped by sunspot\n\nmagnetic field lines with arch-like configuration, are identified as the sources of\n\n-21-\n\nnoise continuum storms in metric and decametric wave frequencies.\n\nTherefore,\n\nthese sources usually form double source structures, the polarization of which\nis opposite from each other (e.g., Kai, 1970; Kai and Sheridan, 1973; Wild, 1970)\n(see Fig. 6).\n\n-22-\n\n5.\n\nPossible Magnetic Configuration of Radio Continuum Sources\n\nIt has been shown in Figs. 5 and 6 that radio continuum noise storm sources\nare usually accompanied by magnetically active sunspot regions.\n\nAbove these\n\nregions, magnetic field lines generally consist of bipolar type configuration,\nthbugh very complicated.\n\nIn fact, the activity in these continuum emissions usually\n\ntends to increase when associated sunspot magnetic configurations change into\nsuch types as fP Y and y . This fact suggests that magnetic configuration above\nsunspot groups is very important in generating the condition favorable to the\noccurrence of these noise continuum emissions in the solar corona, although this\ncondition is clearly dependent on the efficiency on the generation of energetic\nelectrons of Key energy (e. g., 10 - 100 Kev).\nIn order that these electrons are well confined in the region above associated\nsunspot groups must not be opened into infinity, but closed somewhere in the\nsolar corona or envelope.\n\nIf these field lines were opened, all electrons generated\n\nin sunspot groups would be soon released into outer space and therefore, no radio\nnoise continuum storm sources would be formed above sunspot groups.\n\nSince\n\nsuch closed field lines are able to confine charged particles, though slowly releasing\ndue to their drift motion (Benz and Gold, 1971; Newkirk, 1973), it may be said that\nthe magnetic configuration associated with noise continuum sources are usually\nsimilar to those shown in Figs. 5 and 6.\n\nHowever, it should be remarked that any\n\nsimple configuration of bipolar type sunspot magnetic fields is not useful to explain\nefficient generation of Kev electrons in sunspot groups, because this configuration\nis not appropriate to the onset of instability effective to electron acceleration.\nindicated in Fig. 1, the activity of metric noise continuum emission was highly\n\nAs\n\nintensified immediately after the configuration of the sunspot magnetic fields,\nfor instance MacMath No. 11294, changed into the\n\n1Y\n\ntype.\n\nThis result suggests\n\nthat this type of complex configuration is very efficient to the generation of Key\nelectrons.\nIt may be, however, mentioned that the region where Key electrons are\ngenerated, is not identified as that where radio noise continuum emissions are\nproduced, even if they are both located in the solar coronal region.\n\nIt seems\n\nthat the former is closely connected with observable sunspot groups because\nKev electrons seem to be generated deep in the solar atmosphere in association\nwith some instability of sunspot magnetic fields which are indirectly seen as the\nchange of sunspot magnetic fields into some complex types as /37 and y . As\nshown in Fig. 5, radio continuum sources are generally formed in the region\nwhere extended sunspot magnetic field lines are closed with an arch-like\nconfiguration.\n\nThe results obtaineJ by Gergely (1974) indicate that almost all\n\nthe cases have such magnetic configurations as shown in Fig. 5.\n\nSeveral models\n\nproposed thus far also show that the configuration shown in this figure is most\nplausible to explain the development of radio noise continuum storm sources (see\nKai, 1970; Wilcox, 1968; Sakurai and Stone, 1971; Sakurai, 1971 a, b; Daignes\net al, 1971; Kai and Sheridan, 1973; Dulk and Nelson, 1973; Stewart and Labrum,\n1972).\n\nHowever, it must be remarked that there exist two distinct types of these\n\nradio sources with respect to both the extension of arch-like magnetic configurations\ninto the solar corona and the electron density distribution associated with these\nconfigurations (Gergely, 1974).\n\nHighly densed plasma regions extended into the\n\n-24-\n\nsolar corona are usually associated with the largely extended arch-like magnetic\nconfigurations accompanying radio noise continuum storms and vice versa.\n\nAs\n\nindicated by Gergely (1974), in general, newly-born active radio continuum sources\nare, however, accompanied by far-extended regions with high background electron\ndensity concentration into the solar corona.\n\nThis fact suggests that, as suggested\n\nin Chapter 2, arch-like sunspot magnetic field lines tend to generally extend\noutward through the coronal region after newly born while trapping energetic\nelectrons generated below.\nKai and Sekiguchi (1973).\n\nThis explanation is consistent with that proposed by\nSakurai (1974) has also considered the possibility as an\n\nimportant step on the development of radio noise continuum storms in metric and\ndecametric wave frequencies.\n\n-25-\n\n6.\n\nGeneration and Storage Mechanisms of Energetic Electrons Responsible\nfor The Storms\n\nIt has already been mentioned that both radio noise continuum storms and\nassociated type III radio bursts are generated by some plasma processes being\nexcited by the streams of Key electrons passing through the background plasma medium in the\nsolar coronal region.\n\nAt the present moment, we do not know any emission mechanism\n\nindependent from the role of these energetic electrons in the solar corona.\n\nAs shown\n\nby Sakurai (1971 b, 1973), the continuous streams of Key electrons from radio\ncontinuum storm sources were sometimes observed by means of satellites at the\nearth\'s orbit.\n\nIn fact, the tiine variation of the electron flux was very similar\n\nto that of radio continuum flux in hectometric wave frequencies or higher during\nOctober to-November, 1968.\n\nThis ,sort of observation gives us an important clue\n\nto find out the emission mechanism of these continuum storms, because these\nstorms are generally accompanied by enhanced activity of type III burst storms\n(Fainberg and Stone, 1971, 1974).\nAs we have described in Chapter 2, the development of radio continuum\nstorm sources are usually preceded by that of the sources of microwave S-component\nemissions.\n\nSince the S-component emissions are also generated by energetic\n\nelectrons (10 - 100 Kev), although the emission mechanisms are not the same as\nthat of radio continuum storms in metric wave frequencies or less, the generation\nof these electrons is, therefore, very important in explaining steady components\nof radio emissions associated with the growth of magnetically active sunspot\nregions.\n\n-26-\n\nIn order to explain radio noise continuum storms with respect to their emission,\nwe, therefore, have to consider the role of these electrons based on the consideration\nof electron beam-plasma interaction in the solar corona.\n\nIn so doing, we first\n\nconsider the acceleration processes of these electrons independent from observable\nsolar flare activity.\n\nThese processes have been considered by several authors in\n\nrelation to the origin of radio continuum noise storm emissions in metric and\ndecametric wave frequencies (e.g., Takakura, 1963; Fokker, 1965; Trakhtengerts,\n1966; Sakurai, 1967, 1971 b; Gordon, 1970).\n\nIt seems that the interaction of thermal-\n\ntail electrons with plasma waves generated by some microinstability in ambient\nplasmas produces energetic electrons (Takakura, 1967; Gordon, 1970).\n\nSuch\n\ninstability seems to be continually produced in and above sunspot regions while\nthey are rapidly growing and changing into a magnetically complex configuration.\nAlthough, at present, we do not know yet the real processes for electron acceleration\nin active regions, it is very certaua that this acceleration is closely connected with\nmicroinstability associated with changing sunspot magnetic fields.\nAfter acceleration to Kev energy, these electrons begin to interact with sunspot\nmagnetic fields ambient in the region where the acceleration takes place.\n\nThis\n\ninteraction mainly seems to consist of diffusion process due to drifting motion of\nthe accelerated electrons, which renders these electrons to disappear sooner or\nlater from the acceleration regions or their neighborhood.\n\nSince it seems likely\n\nthat the source regions of radio continuum emissions in metric and decametric\nwave frequencies are located above or close to the acceleration regions mentioned\nabove, it is necessary to consider the storage mechanism of the accelerated\n\n-27-\n\nelectrons after they have moved into the radio source regions observed.\nAs estimated by Sakurai (1967) and Kane and I\'in (1972), these electrons seem\nto be stored in the regions where the intensity of ambient sunspot magnetic fields\nis 10 to 100 gauss and the background electron density is 108 to 10 9 per cm 3 .\nBecause of the intense magnetic fields, it seems difficult for the electrons to\nescape so soon from both the acceleration and the source regions by means of\ndiffusion.\n\nHence various processes regarding the energy loss of these electrons\n\nbecome important in estimating whether these electrons are fully considered as\nthe source of noise continuum emissions under consideration.\n\nOne of these processes\n\nmay be considered as the mechanism of these continuum emissions.\n\nAlthough we\n\nare unable to estimate the energy loss rate of individual electrons for these emissions\nbecause of the lack of theory, it may be said that, as energy loss process, these\nemissions are one of the most important phenomena related to the behavior of\nthese electrons in the solar corona.\nIt is known, as discuss ed in last chapter, that the configuration of sunspot\nmagnetic fields plays a role on the formation of the sources of radio noise\ncontinuum emissions.\n\nTherefore, it seems useful to take into account this con-\n\nfiguration as an important factor on the efficiency of storage of energetic electrons\nin small regions above active sunspots.\n\nIn fact, we have known that, in general,\n\nthe configuration of sunspot magnetic fields in the solar corona is similar to\nthat which is shown in Fig. 5.\n\nThe arch-like structure of the field lines is usually\n\nnecessary for energetic electrons to be efficiently confined in order that they are\nthe source of radio continuum storm emissions.\n\n-28-\n\n7.\n\nRelation Between Metric and Decametric Noise Storm Sources and\nMicrowave S-component Emissions\n\nRecently Kai and Sekiguchi (1973) 1 ) proposed an idea about the relation\nof metric continuum noise storms often called type I storms, with the S-component of microwave radio emissions.\n\nTheir result indicates that these noise\n\nstorms are developed as a result of the growth of the S-component emissions\nassociated with active sunspot groups.\n\nAs an example, they showed the time\n\nvariation of both noise storms and S-component emissions associated with the\nactive region MacMath No. 11294, which passed through the central meridian\nof the solar disk on the late 6 of May 1971.\n\nAccording to Gergely (1974)2) , this\n\nregion was quite active on the generation of both decametric type III burst storms\nduring its passage over the solar disk.\nIn this paper, we consider various activities reported by Kai et al. (1973)1)\nand Gergely (1974)2) by taking into account the properties of this active region\nand its relation to low-frequency radio burst emissions observed by the IMP-6\nsatellite.\n\nIn so doing, we examine the relation of metric noise continuum storms\n\n(200 MHz) with the S-component of microwave emissions (2800 MHz).\n\nTaking\n\nthe results analyzed here into consideration, we propose a model on the growth of\nradio noise continuum sources in metric and decametric frequencies and its relation\nto microwave and other solar active phenomena.\n\n-29-\n\nIn order to study the relation between metric noise continuum storms and\nS-component of microwave emissions, we have selected the radio data recorded\nat Hiraiso (200 MHz) and Ottawa (2800 MHz) as representatives for metric and\nmicrowave emissions, respectively.\n\nSince the decametric emission activity\n\nobserved activity at Clark Lake has been analyzed by Gergely (1974)2) in greater\ndetail, this paper refers to his results in the discussion on this activity in relation\nto the activity in other wave frequencies.\n\nThe data obtained by the IMP-6 satellite\n\nare also considered in studing low-frequency type III burst activity.\nThe active region MacMath No. 11294 appeared at the east limb of the sun\non 1 May 1971, and then passed through the central meridian on the late 6 of May\n1971.\n\nThe CMP of the active region at 169 MHz on-6-7 May has been reported in\n\nthe Solar Geophysical Data (1971)\n\n. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the S-component of\n\nmicrowave emission at 2800 Mitz began to increase on 3 and reached maximum on\n9 of May.\n\nAt metric wave region (200 MHz), the radio flux intensity started to\n\nabruptly increase on 6 and then reached maximum intensity on 8 of May.\n\nThe\n\ndecametric continuum noise emissions also showed an activity similar to that at\n200 MHz (see Gergely, 1974)2 .\n\nWhen we\n\nconsider the sunspot characteristics of\n\nthis active region, we find that the sunspot type changed from pP to py types on 6\nof this month.\n\n(Fig. 1(b)). This spot group is also classified as the E type when\n\nit became the fsconfiguration.\n\nIt may be here remarked that the association of ihetric noise continuum emissions\n.\nwith sunspot groups of E and F types has been well established 4) One day later\n\n(7th), type III burst activity in decametric frequencies became most intense above\nthis region 2). Furthermore, Gergely (1974)2) found that this intense activity was\nseen above the active region under discussion and was mainly restricted in the\nfrequency range below 45 MHz.\n\nThis activity seems to have been extended into\n\nthe frequency region less than 5 MHz since type III burst activity observed by the\nIMP-6 satellite indicates that these low frequency burst storms were associated\nwith the activity in decametric wave frequencies.\n\nFurthermore, these storms were\n\nobserved between 7 to 10 of this month by means of this satellite.\n\nThese results\n\nindicate that the intensification of metric and decametric noise continuum storms\nmight have occurred in association with the growth of the sunspot group into the\ncomplex types such as fy.\n\nFurthermore, it should be remarked that the mean field\n\nintensity of this sunspot group also reached maximum on 6 of May, as shown in\nFig. 1(b).\nAs understood from the results shown in Fig. 1, the activation of the S-component\nemission began on 3 of May and therefore occurred three days earlier than that of\nmetric continuum emission (see Kai et al., 1973)1).\n\nThis difference between metric\n\nand microwave emissions is clearly seen in Fig. 3 since it turns out that S-component\nemissions tend to increase first several days before the beginning of sharp increase\nof metric noise continuum flux.\n\nIn this figure, we show the observational results\n\nfor two active regions, MacMath Nos. 11294 and 12094.\n\nIt is clear that the tendency\n\nof the variation of radio flux intensity is very similar between these two active\n\n~-31-\n\nregions.\n\nThis tendency is usually seen for almost all the cases analyzed though\n\nslightly different from each other.\nIt is clear from Figs. 1 and 3 that the maximum flux intensity at 2800 MHz\nwas reached on 8, one day later after the metric flux intensity reached maximum\non 7.\n\nHowever, in general, the maximum in metric noise continuum flux intensity\n\nis reached on the same day or day later when S-component emission reaches maximum, as indicated in Fig. 4.\n(1973)1).\n\nA similar result has been obtained by Kai et al.\n\nWith the result of Fig. 3, this result strongly suggests that the growth of\n\nS-component emission at microwave frequency is very important to the development\nof metric and decametric continuum noise storms.\n\nWhen considering the fact that\n\nthe S-component activity begins several days earlier then that of metric continuum\nemissions (Fig. 1(a)), we may say that the change of sunspot activity as shown\nin Fig. 1(b) is very important on the fast growth of metric and decametric noise\ncontinuum storm sources.\nAlthough causal relationship between sunspot activity change and the formation\nof these noise storm sources has not been found yet, it seems natural that energetic\nelectrons responsible for these noise continuum emissions are very effectively\ngenerated when sunspot groups grow into complex configurations such as/ Y type\nin magnetic polarity distribution.\n\nWhen we consider that these noise continuum\n\nemissions are generated by plasma processes from these electrons, 5)-7) the\nrelation obtained in this paper would be reasonably explained.\n\nIn this case, we\n\nshould recognize that the S-component activity is not much dependent on the metric\n\n-32-\n\nnoise continuum emissions, but this activity and its growth tend to produce the\nsources of metric and decametric noise continuum emissions.\n\nType III burst\n\nstorms would also be produced as a result of the escape of the electrons mentioned\nabove from the top region of metric and decametric noise continuum sources.\nThis interpretation would also be useful to explain the cause of the highest observed\nfrequencies of type III bursts associated with continuum noise sources in metric\nand decametric frequencies. 2), 8)-9) The on-fringe type III bursts, 2) therefore,\nseem to be generated by those electrons described above.\nIn summary, it is concluded that the growth of sunspot groups into very complex type such as fly is very important to the development of metric and decametr ic\n\'noise continuu mstorm sources associated with type III burst storm activity in low\nfrequencies.\n\n-33-\n\n8.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nWe have considered the development of radio continuum storm sources in\nmetric wave frequencies or less in reference to the growth of the S-component\nsources in microwave frequencies.\n\nIn the discussion on the relation between\n\nthese two sources just mentioned, we have emphasized the important role of\nenergetic electrons of 10 - 100 Key on the emissions of these radio waves in\nwide-frequency range.\n\nAs described in Chapter 4, we do not know yet the\n\nmechanism of radio noise continuum emissions in metric and decametric wave\nfrequencies, although many theories have been proposed.\n\nIn this paper, in order\n\nto explain some observed characteristics, we have pointed out the importance of\ntwo-stream instability associated with energetic electron streams, although it is\nknown that the inhibition of this instability is very important to explain the emission\nprocesses of type III radio bursts.\n\nFurthermore, it nay be said that the onset\n\nof this instability is closely connected with the behavior of energetic electrons\nin ambient sunspot magnetic fields: that is, type III bursts are generally produced\nby electron streams moving along ambient sunspot magnetic .field.lines radially\nextended into the solar corona.\n\nOn the other hand, the noise continuum storm\n\nemissions under discussion are produced in the sunspot magnetic fields with a\nconfiguration as shown in Fig; 5.\n\nThis sort of configuration seems to be very\n\neffective on the onset of the instability associated with electron streams.\n\nOn this\n\nproblem, some further investigation would be necessary.\nWe here summarize several important problems in future investigation as\nfollows:\n-34-\n\n1)\n\nThe relation among radio noise continuum storms (metric or less), the\n\nS-component of microwave emissions and type III burst storms.\n2)\n\nThe emission mechanism of radio noise continuum storm.\n\n3)\n\nThe relation of radio noise continuum storms to solar active phenomena\n\nduring their growing and decaying phases.\n4)\n\nThe generation mechanism of energetic electrons in sunspot magnetic fields\n\nactively growing.\n5)\n\nThe role of energetic electrons on the mechanism of the S-component\n\nemissions in microwave frequencies.\nThese problems described above seem to be important in understanding the\nnature of radio noise continuum storm sources in metric or lower wave frequencies.\nIt seems that the satellite observations in hectometric and kilometric wave frequencies\ngive us a clue to find-out what mechanism is working on the emission of radio -waves\nin these frequencies.\n\nFurthermore, these electrons would be very useful to find\n\nthe mechanism of radio noise continuum storms in higher wave frequencies.\n\n-35-\n\nReferences\n\nAppleton, E.
