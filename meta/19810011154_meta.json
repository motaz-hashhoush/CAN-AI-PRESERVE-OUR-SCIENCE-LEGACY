Due to difficulty in making accurate vector measurements, early satellites such as Sputnik and Vanguard measured only the magnitude survey. The attitude accuracy was 20 arc sec. Both the Earth's core fields and the fields arising from its crust were mapped from satellite data. The standard model of the core consists of a scalar potential represented by a spherical harmonics series. Models of the crustal field are relatively new. Mathematical representation is achieved in localized areas by arrays of dipoles appropriately located in the Earth's crust. Measurements of the Earth's field are used in navigation, to map charged particles in the magnetosphere, to study fluid properties in the Earth's core, to infer conductivity of the upper mantels, and to delineate regional scale geological features.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810011154, "id": "f3eeb5f92d494d128c2c0ef818e9ac69", "publicationDate": "1981-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19810011154.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19810011154/downloads/19810011154.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19810011154/downloads/19810011154.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19810011154/downloads/19810011154.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
