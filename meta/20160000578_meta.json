NASA research on NexGen airspace solutions and its development of autonomous and intelligent technologies will revolutionize both the nation's air transporation systems and have applicability to the low altitude flight economy and to both air and ground transporation, more generally. NASA's understanding of the Earth as a complex of integrated systems contributes to humanity's perception of the sustainability of our home planet. Research at NASA Ames on closed environment life support systems produces directly applicable lessons on energy, water, and resource management in ground-based infrastructure. Moreover, every NASA campus is a 'city'; including an urbanscape and a workplace including scientists, human relations specialists, plumbers, engineers, facility managers, construction trades, transportation managers, software developers, leaders, financial planners, technologists, electricians, students, accountants, and even lawyers. NASA is applying the lessons of our mission-related activities to our urbanscapes and infrastructure, and also anticipates a leadership role in developing future environments for living and working in space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160000578, "endDate": "2015-10-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Urban Age Institute", "location": "San Francisco, CA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "a662b762f8364dff82967723fdff0567", "id": "99e4cabf5c9e4dc6a82abf07ae6a2f43"}], "name": "Meeting of the Minds 2015", "location": "Richmond, CA", "id": "a662b762f8364dff82967723fdff0567", "startDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160000578, "id": "55b0caed72014aaebab7468a6d1c050e", "publicationDate": "2015-10-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160000578.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160000578/downloads/20160000578.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160000578/downloads/20160000578.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160000578/downloads/20160000578.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
