Prior to receiving new sample collections from carbon rich asteroids, we instituted a monitoring program to characterize the microbial ecology of these labs and to understand how organisms could interact with and potentially contaminate current and future collections. Methods: Beginning in Oct. 2017 we sampled the Meteorite (ISO 7 equivalent) and Pristine Lunar (ISO 5 equivalent) labs on a monthly basis. Surface samples were collected using dry swabs. Air samples were collected using an impactor style air sampler. Cultivable organisms were identified and characterized. Aliquots of each sample were also preserved for DNA sequencing. For each sampling event recovery rate was calculated as the percentage of samples showing microbial growth1. Fungal colonies were selected for amino acid extraction and analysis via Ultra- Performance Liquid Chromatography with Fluorescence Detection and Mass Spectrometry. \n\n\n\n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190026763, "endDate": "2019-06-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Geophysical Union (AGU)", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "12f8dc5516504ceaa6aa5f70166b2bbb", "id": "2149eb620dd14d3fa33e2b07a27a1b62"}], "name": "AbSciCon 2019", "location": "Bellevue, WA", "id": "12f8dc5516504ceaa6aa5f70166b2bbb", "startDate": "2019-06-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190026763, "id": "da6ca7f28f304996b094c8bf65707664", "publicationDate": "2019-06-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190026763.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190026763/downloads/20190026763.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190026763/downloads/20190026763.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190026763/downloads/20190026763.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
