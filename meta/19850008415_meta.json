This facility is a superfluid-helium-cooled, 0.85-meter infrared telescope to be placed in orbit in 1993. It is designed to carry out photometry over the wavelength range 2 to 700 micrometers, and diffraction-limited imagery in either broad or narrow spectral bands over the range 1.8 to 200 micrometers. It is proposed that SIRTF measure spectra in the range 2.5 to 200 micrometers with resolving power between 50 and 1000 and that the focal plane contain about 20,000 detector elements, both discrete and in arrays. The SIRTF observatory is designed to be a long-lived facility providing opportunities for general investigations by the entire scientific community. For following up the all-sky survey carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), SIRTF is ideal. It can do a deep survey to flux levels 5000 times fainer than IRAS and can obtain spectra of even the faintest IRAS sources.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850008415, "id": "b4aca9ff967649568ca73f0452841a7c", "publicationDate": "1984-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19850008415.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19850008415/downloads/19850008415.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19850008415/downloads/19850008415.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19850008415/downloads/19850008415.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
