According to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, a Biological Assessment must be conducted and a Biological Opinion, with terms and conditions, rendered (the Opinion by the U.S. Department of the Interior) before construction of any federal project that may affect endangered or threatened flora or fauna. After construction, a final report is filed with the Department. The desert tortoise, designated \"threatened\" by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Mojave ground squirrel and the Lane Mountain milk vetch, both designated \"candidate threatened,\" required the reporting specified by the Act. The Assessment found no significant danger to the animal species if workers are educated about them. No stands of the plant species were observed in the surveyed construction area. The Department issued a Biological Opinion to safeguard the two animal species. The Service and the California Department of Fish and Game both issued a Biological Concurrence that JPL had satisfied all environmental criteria for preserving threatened species.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19970037555, "id": "0a96d5cc3a2041558e0b56942501d55a", "publicationDate": "1996-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19970037555.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19970037555/downloads/19970037555.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19970037555/downloads/19970037555.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19970037555/downloads/19970037555.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
