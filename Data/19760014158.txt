ESULTS\n\nI.\n\n.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nThis study has been diicted at the rendezvous and docking operations\n\nassociated with the full capability Space Tug.\n\nIt has investigated all of the associ\n\n\nated technologies; selected and ranked alternate mechanizations capable of performing\n\nrequired operations, and recommended development activities\nto a proven system design.\n\nthat will lead\n\n\nWhile this study has been directed at only one of the\n\n\nrendezvous and docking applications to be encountered in the next decade, the find\xc2\xad\nings are pertinent to, several STS applications that can be foreseen.\n\nAs a conse\xc2\xad\n\nquence, these study results have a general value beyond the specific study objec\xc2\xad\ntives.\n\nA.\n\nOBJECTIVES & EMPHASIS\n\nThese specific objectives for the Space Tug Docking Study were outlined\n\n\nin the original request for proposal as follows.\n\nFirst, to define, through a\n\n\ntotal systems analysis, requirements, techniques, schemes, mechanisms, components\n\nand subsystems for rendezvous and docking operations.\n\nSecond, synthesize candi\xc2\xad\n\ndate rendezvous and docking systems providing rationale through analysis for their\n\nselection.\n\nThird, recommend through an evaluation of relative merits the best\n\n\nmanual, automated and hybrid systems.\n\nAnd finally,,provide plans for the accom\xc2\xad\n\nplishment of the simulation/demonstration testing of the sele&ted systems.\n\n\nevls of\n\nk\n\nAutonomy\n\nSTDS Fining\n\nReidezvou.\n& ockingx

together with the ultimate result of Tug R/V & D activity -- which\n\nwill either be servicing or retrieval of a spacecraft.\non the inspect, align, close and dock operations.\n\nThis study concentrates\n\n\nThe reason for this concentra\xc2\xad\n\ntion is that a considerable amount of recent or concurrent effort has been di\xc2\xad\nrected at the other operations.\n\nIt has been the intent of this study to build\n\n\nupon and supplement these other activities.\n\nSeveral of these study relationships are particularly significant.\n\nFirst,\n\n\nthe General Dynamics Tug Avionics Study has defined a highly accurate navigation\n\nsystem based upon updates received from an Interferometer Landmark Tracker.\n\nThe\n\n\naccuracy of this system minimizes the range of initial conditions over which the\n\nR/V & D system must operate.\nsystem mechanization.\n\nThis GDC study also recommended a particular R/V &D\n\n\nThis system has been taken into account in the current\n\n\nstudy, but investigation of various levels of autonomy and spacecraft cooperation\n\nas well as more detailed docking evaluation has led to several alternate system\n\nrecommendations.\n\nThe MDAC Payload Requirements Compatibility Study and the MMC Multi-Use\n\nMission Support Equipment Study have investigated the problems of supporting\n\n(structural support, particularly) retrieved spacecraft.\n\nThe problem of meeting\n\n\ndocking requirements and structural support requirements on return into the\n\nShuttle payload bay for return to earth is particularly complex and involves\n\nsignificant trades.\n\nThis study builds on the flindings of these two studies, com\xc2\xad\n\npares, and recommends some new alternatives.\n\nThe MMC Integrated Orbital Servicing Study investigated the basis for\n\nthe selection of a cost effective orbital maintenance system supported by the\n\nspace transportation system.\n\nThe conclusions and recommendations reached during\n\n\n.this servicing study effort have been taken into account in the STDS effort.\n\nCom\xc2\xad\n\npatibility with servicing is considered a desirable goal, and has been taken into\n\naccount in the selections and rankings developed here.\n\n\n1-2\n\n\nWBS 1100\n\nTask A\n\n&D\nDa\ntRqrt\'s Base\n-\n\n\nri\nBriefing-\n\n\nWBS 12M\n\nWBS ]300 Task

effort.\n\nRequirements and data base information was compiled early in the study and changed\n\nminimally afterward.\n\nAnalytic support in the areas of flight mechanics and dock\xc2\xad\n\ning dynamics continued throughout the study.\n\nTask B concentrated on synthesizing\n\n\ncandidate systems (manual, autonomous and hybrid types) capable of meeting the.\n\nrequirements defined in and comprising the data base generated in Task A.\n\n\'These\n\n\nsystems were then ranked based on criteria developed and weighted with a sensi\xc2\xad\ntivity to functional requirements, operational and cost objectives.\n\nAn evaluation\n\n\nof developmental problems associated with the candidate systems selected lead\n\ninto the Task C effort, where SRT and Simulation/Demonstration objectives and\n\n\n1-3\n\n\nplans were evolved.\n\nThe SIM/DEN plans evolved married developmental requirements\n\n\nto MSFC laboratory facilities, supplementing with other test facilities when re\xc2\xad\nquired, recommending MSFC facility modification where applicable.\n\nThis total\n\n\neffort was\'supplemented by programmatic analyses to provide realistic and cost\n\nconscious background

objectives.\n\nIt has been a superior effort, in relation\n\nto the dollar value of the study., These -activities do, of course, suggest further\nactivity: formal simulation of the inspection maneuvers; expansion of the dodking\nsimulation from planar to 3-D space; detailed application of the docking dynamics\nprograms to more detailed specification of docking mechanism parameters (e.g.\n\ndanping, spring constants, et al).\n\n1-5\n\n\n,\'\xc2\xad\n\n/system\nSReqirements\n\nt\n\nSConcepts.\nConfiguration J\n\nI\n\n\\\n\nAvionics\n\n"\n\nu\n\nSubsystems ,\n\nAAutonomous Ranking\noManual Ranking\nFig. 1-5\n\nSystem Configuration & Selection Approach\n\n\nThe system configuration and ranking process used in this study is depicted\n\n\nin Fig.\n\n1-5.\n\nThis process involved generation and ranking of a set of manual can\xc2\xad\n\ndidates and a set of autonomous candidates.\n\nUsing the evaluations of the manual\n\n\nand autonomous candidates, a single hybrid system combining the best features of\n\nboth was evolved. Each of these system candidates is capable of meeting system\n\nlevel requirements defined under Task A.\n\nThe ranking process used to identify the\n\n\nmore promising system candidates used a numerical approach.\n\nThe candidates were\n\n\ncompared over a range of selection criteria (cost, performance and growth potential\n\nparameters).\n\nNumerical rankings were weighted to reflect relative importance and\n\n\nsummed to establish a comparable figure of merit.\n\nThe top ranking candidates were\n\n\nused to establish SRT and SIM/DEM requirements.\n\nThe basic philosophy behind the developmental activity defined during this\n\nstudy has been practical.\n\nThe top ranking system candidates have been evaluated\n\n\nto identify long lead component development requirements, and areas where opera\xc2\xad\ntional problems may develop.\n1-6\n\nPlans have been evolved to assure that these\n\n\nrequirements/operations are addressed in\'a timely manner -- to assure that po\xc2\xad\ntential problems are understood and worked out before expensive developments\n\nhave proceeded too long down the wrong path.\n\nThis kind of attention early in a\n\n\ndevelopment program is sure to save money in-the long term.\n\nThe only hazard is\n\n\nthe possibility of changing requirements as the program evolves.\n\nThis possi\xc2\xad\n\nbility requires continued integration of. new requirements running in parallel\n\nto SRT and SIM/DEM activity.\n\nD. \t\n\nMAJOR STUDY FINDINGS\nCurrent technology, conventional RF-RADAR and video systems, easily accom\xc2\xad\n\nmodates remote rendezvous and docking in the manual mode where real time ground\n\nsupport is used to direct the sequence of events.\n\nAutonomous docking requires\n\n\nsome relatively low risk new development work -- either flight qualification of\n\nthe proven GaAs Scanning Laser Radar or advancement of autonomous TV docking al\xc2\xad\ngorithms.\n\nHybrid systems are most attractive as they provide a desirable level of\n\nredundancy, provide flexibility to accommodate unforeseen events.\n\nHybrid systems\n\n\noffer a low risk approach to the development of an autonomous rendezvous and dock\xc2\xad\ning capability.\n\nThus the hybrid approach is the most feasible development option.\n\n\nEarly flights can be made with heavy manual supervision.\n\nAs confidence is gained,\n\n\nautonomous approaches can be verified -- eventually evolving a flexible rendezvous\n\nand docking capability able to operate effectively in any situation.\n\nAttractive alternate development paths are available in close-in RF dock\xc2\xad\ning sensors and in non-impact docking mechanisms.\n\nClose-in RE sensing, to within\n\n\none or two feet of the target, is possible using passive (no power required) time\n\ndelay retroflectors on the spacecraft.\n\nThis approach has the advantage of using\n\n\nflight proven technology, although new component development/qualification would\n\nbe required.\n\nNon-impact docking is achievable through the use of a close-in sta\xc2\xad\n\ntion keeping mode coupled with an articulated docking device (e.g. a steerable\n\nSTEM device).\n\nThis approach has the advantage of a simple structural interface\n\n\nbetween Tug and retrieval spacecraft, and a potential for minimal impact on the\n\n\t\nspacecraft.\n\nIt is felt that these options should be kept open until future\n\n\nrendezvous and docking requirements are more completely understood.\n\n\n1-7\n\nE.\n\nRECOMMENDED FUTURE ACTIVITY\n\nThree major types of future activity are recommended as a result of this\n\n\nstudy.\n\nThe first category is the Simulation/Demonstration activity that has been\n\n\ndefined in the Task C effort.\n\nPursuit of this laboratory testing activity affords\n\n\na technique for economically selecting between development options, arriving at a\n\nproven design approach soundly based on an adequate simulation bf anticipated\n\nflight conditions.\n\nThe second category is the specific technology areas that have been identi\xc2\xad\nfied during the studyO These areas include development and application of digital\n\nsimulation tools, flight algorithm development, and design effort required to ad\xc2\xad\nvance alternate design options. These activities should be pursued over the next\n\n2-3 years and then either discarded or integrated into the SIM/DEM activity.\n\nThe final category is a broad integration role that should be begun imme\xc2\xad\ndiately and continued throughout the STS operational life. It is apparent that the\n\nrole of rendezvous and docking in future space operations is expanding.\n\nMany appli\xc2\xad\n\ncations are emerging that can benefit from the technology surveyed in this study.\n\nAn initial activity in this integration role is an applicationd system study to\n\nplace varied future requirements in perspective and define overall development/\n\noperation plans that will most effectively meet all objectives.\n\nThe implementation\n\n\nof these plans leads to an integration role that on one hand pursues the develop\xc2\xad\nment of a rendezvous and docking capability, and on the other hand supports opera\xc2\xad\ntionAl activities throughout the active life of this capability.\n\n\nI-8\n\nII.\n\nREQUIREMENTS AND DATA BASE\n\nPrevious studies have been conducted for many aspects of Space Shuttle,\n\n\nSpace Tug and payloads which assume a rendezvous and docking capability.\n\nThe\n\n\nSpace Shuttle Payload Description Activity (SSPDA), the NASA Mission Model and the\n\nBaseline Space Tug requirements documents are examples.\n\nAlso, a significant amount\n\n\nof research and development work has been underway in developing new subsystems\n\nwhich are useful for rendezvous and docking.\n\nHowever, there has been no concerted effort to research these areas and\n\nderive a set of requirements for a rendezvous and docking system, nor to catalog\n\nthe existing candidate sensor, mechanism or strategy characteristics.\n\nThe object\n\n\nof this task was to accomplish these goals.\n\nAdditionally, analyses were performed to evaluate rendezvous and docking\n\nschemes and to determine effects of docking dynamics.\n\nA.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS DERIVATION\n\nRendezvous and Docking System requirements were derived from many sources\n\n\nas well as generated from engineering analyses.\n\nAdditionally, desirable features\n\n\nof a docking system were identified and used as weighting factors for selection\n\nof candidate subsystems.\n\nThe major sources of requirements were Space Tug, Space\xc2\xad\n\ncraft, Interface and Operations documents.\n\nThe key system level docking require\xc2\xad\n\nments from these areas are illustrated in Figure II-1 and are described in more\n\ndetail in the following paragraphs.\n\nRequirements derive from many sources;a complete tabulation of all system\n\nlevel requirements with

mechanism designs could be eliminated by the system level\n\nrequirement to deliver one diameter spacecraft and retrieve another.\n\nOther\n\n\nfactors considered in the analyses included servicing, infant mortality retrieval\n\nand impacts of docking with non-cooperative spacecraft.\n\nSince the STDS charter was for a system to retrieve spacecraft, the cap\xc2\xad\nability to service was not imposed as a requirement.\n\nThe approach for the study\n\n\nwas to evaluate the candidate systems based on servicing potential capability\n\nand rank each system on this basis.\n\nThe capability for infant mortality retrieval of spacecraft has numerous\n\nimplications.\n\nA prime requirement is that spacecraft status be ascertained while\n\n\nthe space tug or delivery vehicle is in the vicinity.\n\nIf this service is provided\n\n\nfor all spacecraft delivered, including those for which retrieval was not planned,\n\ndocking aids/mechanisms must be provided.\n\nAlso, the spacecraft mortality can\n\n\noccur after partial deployment of appendages and jettison of these appendages\n\nplus safing of the spacecraft before recovery must be assured.\n\nImplications to\n\n\nthe tug include a stationkeeping capability with TV observing the spacecraft for\n\nstatus.\n\nThis requires mission control involvement with man-in-loop and operational\n\n\nplanning for alternate missions/sequences and detection and correction capabiliiies\n\nbe provided via RF links.\n\nAn analysis of spacecraft top-level functional failure modes and the re\xc2\xad\ntrieval capability of a malfunctioning (non-cooperative) spacecraft.\n\nAt this stage\n\n\nof spacecraft design definition the analysis was necessarily gross in nature with\n\nan objective of determining an estimated percentage of spacecraft failure types\n\nwhich are potentially retrievable.\nfied for each spacecraft.\n\nThirteen major types of failures were identi\xc2\xad\n\nSome of the results, as a percent of total failure\n\n\nmodes, are provided in tabular form below, followed by some conclusions.\n\nThree-Axis\nRetrieval not feasible at all\n\n7%\n\nSpin\n\n0%\n\n\nRetrieval potential high (stable vehicle)\n\n46%\n\n\nRetrieval feasibility depends on inspection\n\n6i%\n\n38%\n\n\nVehicle state is known on ground\n\n38%\n\n30%\n\n\nVehicle state is not known on ground\nVehicle state uncertain\n\n11-4\n\n15%\n\n38_/\n\n46%\n\n\n24%\n\n24%\n\n\nRetrieval of failed spacecraft,,particularly spin-stabilized, appears\n\nfeasible in a number of instances.\n\nOnly a very small percentage of failure modes\n\n\nleaves the spacecraft in a totally nonretrievable state.\n\nThe potential of retrieval of a high percentage of spacecraft failure modes\xc2\xad\n(over 50% for either type) depends on an inspection by the tug.\n\nThere is consider\xc2\xad\n\nable hesitation to expend alot of orbital energy in pursuit of a spacecraft whose\n\nretrievability is not known until rendezvous with it.\n\nTo alleviate that unknown,\n\n\nit might be worth requiring that every spacecraft has some low-bit-rate method of\n\ndumping vehicle status to the ground from an omni antenna when a failed condition\n\narises in order to gain some likelihood of retrievability.\n\nThe large percentage of spacecraft failure modes requiring inspection before\n\nretrieval, and the unknowns involved in making a "retrieve" decision, virtually\n\ndictate a man in the loop for failed spacecraft retrieval.\n\nTrades between manual,\n\n\nautonomous, and hybrid should consider this seriously when looking at growth from\n\nan operative to a failed spacecraft retrieval capability.\n\nKnowledge of vehicle state, e.g., attitude and rates, is not known, or at\n\nleast uncertain, for well over half the possible failed spacecraft conditions.\n\nAssuming the inspection phase has found docking feasible, it is necessary for the\n\ntug to determine the spacecraft attitude and rate prior to LOS tracking during\n\nclosure.\n\nThis capability impacts hardware sensors, cooperative devices and modes\n\n\nof operation.\n\nCandidate selections should be made considering growth to the cap\xc2\xad\n\nability for determining the vehicle state necessary to accomplish this.\n\n2.\n\nTug Imposed Requirements - Those requirements which derive from Tug sources\n\n\nas well as the desirable features of a docking system from the tug standpoint are\n\nsummarized in Table 11-2.\n\nThe uncertainties in tug position and attitude, as well as spacecraft\n\nposition and attitude must be accommodated by the Docking System.\n\nThis, in\n\n\neffect, reduces the available system budget which can be allocated to the sensors\n\nor increases the uncertainties which must be accommodated by the mechanisms.\n\nFigure\n\n\n11-3 illustrates the Space Tug Control System characteristics and a typical\n\nthree-axis stabilized spacecraft limit cycle deadband.\n\n\n11-5\n\n\nTable

be\n\n1\n2.1 m (7 ft) and for the tug, 5.4 m (18 ft). The tug mass is\n14,590 kg (1000\n\nslugs) and the pitch or yaw moment of inertia is\n48,585 kg-m 2 (37,000 slug-ft 2 ).\n\nIt is also assumed a close-in sensor is employed, that maintains a given\n\nrange and relative attitude as well as lateral translation corrections.\n\nThe trans\xc2\xad\n\nlation corrections are presumed to be provided in much the same way as attitude-\xc2\xad\nby pulsing the side-pointing thrusters to stay within a predetermined translation\n\ndeadband.\n\nFor this example it was assumed two jets would fire at a time and only\n\n\n.for the minimum impulse time of 20 ms.\n.012 inches/sec.\n\nThis pulse results in a lateral rate of\n\n\nThe limit cycle deadband limit is taken at .06 inches by assum\xc2\xad\n\ning an ACS firing to reverse the lateral translation motion no more often than.\n\nonce each five seconds.\n\nThese assumptions represent a close approximation for\n\n\nthe autonomous and hybrid systems.\n\nHowever, for a strictly manual system using\n\n\na TV, no close-in sensor is baselined and the control system relies on the iner\xc2\xad\ntial platform for attitude hold with command inputs for maneuvers.\n\nThe docking dynamics effects impose requirements on the system with re\xc2\xad\ngard to loads, accelerations and shock attenuation requirements.\ninvestigation during the study was propellant slosh effects.\n\nA major area of\n\n\nThe groiindrules,\n\n\napproach definition and results from the dynamics analyses are presented in para\xc2\xad\ngraph D of this section\n\nIn the area of Tug supplied services to spacecraft, the docking system\n\nmust carry the services across the interface.\n\nThe types of services envisioned\n\n\nfor the rendezvous and docking system to support are illustrated in Figure 11-4.\n\n3.\n\ninterface Imposed Requirements -

In the analysis for this study it was found\n\nthat a significant contributor to the errors for an impact docking is traceable\n\na\n\nto the Tug vehicle lateral velocity. For a manual docking that parameter is \n\nfunction of how well the man can discern the target cue and detect he is drifting\n\noff of alignment. It is a nebulous parameter to pin down, but of great importance\n\nbecause of the major contributor to errors that it is.\nin-the-loop- simulation.\n\nIt .undoubtedly requires man\xc2\xad\n\nFor an autonomous docking, much tighter control of the\n\n\nvehicle can be achieved due to reasonably high accuracy of the attitude determine\xc2\xad\ntion sensors. There are limits to the sensor, of course, but there are also\n\nfinite limits on trimming lateral velocities imposed by the Tug vehicle, its con\xc2\xad\ntrol system autopilot design, ACS thrust levels, ACS minimum impulse bits, etc.\n\nThese must be known and accounted for in a total error analysis.\n\nA similar argument arises for the non-impact docking,only in this case the\n\nconcern relates to the stationkeeping period; When the retrieval probe is being\n\nextended. A translation deadband is being maintained using lateral position\n\nsensing and the Tug control system in \n a manner similar to the familiar attitude\n\ncontrol rotational deadband. The rendezvous and docking sensor accuracies are key\n\nerror sources, of course, but again the Tug inherent control system implementation\n\nlimitation, and the man\'s capabilities are equally significant.\n\nThe conclusion of all this is that the capabilities of Tug designs and\n\nman himself should be carefully evaluated, in simulation if necessary, and finite\n\nand credible specifications be placed on the Tug, or any other applicable trans\xc2\xad\n11-21\n\nH\n\nRANGING SENSOR REQUIREMENTS\n\nTABLE It-9\n\nAUTONOMOUS\n\nMANUAL\n\nREQUIRMETS\n\nIMPACT\n\nNON-IMPACT\n\nIMPACT\n\nNON-IMPACT\n\na)\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nN/A\n\n91M\n\nAttitude Determination Capability\n1) Attitude Determination\n\nN/A\n\n(300 ft)\n\n\'Maximum Range\n2) Attitude Determination\n\nN/A\n\n3)\n\nAttitude Determination Accuracy\n\nN/A\n\nI1ma\nN/A\n\n3m\n\nN/A\n\n(0 ft)\n\nMinimum Range\n\n\xc2\xb1llra\n\n_17 mrad\n(+I deg)\n\n46 km\n25 n mi)\n\n91M\n\n(300 ft)\n.m\n\n(3 ft)\n\nC 17 mrad\n(+ I deg)\n46 km\n(\xc2\xb1 25 n mi)\n\nb) Acquisition Range\n\n46 km\n(25 a mi)\n\n46 km\n(25 n mi)\n\n(\n\nc) Range Data Minimum\n\n3m\n(10 ft)\n\n.3m\n(1 ft)\n\n3m\n(10 ft)\n\n.9m\n(3 ft)\n\n+30.5m\n(\xc2\xb1 100 ft)\n+ .3m\n\n+30.5m\n(\xc2\xb1 100 ft)\n+.15m (_+ ft)(long term)\n.5\n\n+30.5m\n(\xc2\xb1 100 ft)\n\xc2\xb1 .3m\n\n+30.5m\n(\xc2\xb1 100 ft)\n+ .3m\n\n(j I ft)\n\n(\xc2\xb1 1 ft)\n\nd) Range Accuracy Far- .93 km to 93 to\n(.5 n mi to 50 n ml)\nNear-3m to .93 km\n(10 ft to .5 n ml)\n\nNear.. m to .93 km\n(3 ft to 10 ft)\n\n+ i ft)\n\n\xc2\xb1.02m (\xc2\xb1.08 ft)(short term)\n\nN/A\nN\xc2\xb1.03m\n\nN/A\n\nNIA\n\n\xc2\xb1.lSm (\xc2\xb1.5 ft)(day-to-day)\n(+. ft)(short term)\n\ne) Range Rate Accuracy\n\nFar- .93 km to 93 km\n(.5 n mi to 50 n mi)\nNear-3m to .93 km\n(10 ft to .5 n ml)\nNear-.9mto .93 km\n(3 ft to 10 ft)\nf) Field-of-View\ng)\n\nh)\n\nLOS Accuracy (Incl.

study,\n\nbut rather, emphasis was placed on refining and verifying the tools that develop\n\nthese requirements.\n\nOur approach and the tools developed are discussed in detail\n\n\nin Section I of

are\n\n\nto provide the following data on the target S/C:\n\nRange\n\nRange Rate\n\nLine-of-Sight Angle\n\nTarget Attitude\n\nAn initial objective in this study Was to canvas all existing or poten\xc2\xad\ntial sensors that could provide any one of, or all, the data desired.\n\nThat\n\n\nsurvey was conducted, vendors were contacted and from that a number of optimum\n\nsensors representing several different technologies were selected as the hard\xc2\xad\nware data base from which the candidate manual autonomous and hybrid systems\n\nwere configured in Section III.\n\nOne\n\nof the key criteria in the candidate selection process was that the\n\n\nlist should represent several different feasible technologies, specifically\n\nsome proven and some advanced.\n\nIt should also include some high performing\n\n\nsensors as well as some lower performing but inexpensive units.\n\nEach sensor\n\n\ndid not have to provide all the data desired; however, where only some data was\n\nachievable, other alternative methods of arriving at the remaining data had to\n\nbe available before this sensor could be considered a valid candidate.\n\nA list of the final set of sensor

referred\n\n\nto as a rendezvous radar, which is useful only up to 30 m (100\')\n\nof the target,\n\n\nand a Dual Mode radar which incorporates a close-in data gathering capability\n\nalong with the rendezvous radar above.\n\nThe latter is comparable to the SLR in\n\n\nthe ranges over which it performs and the type of data gathered.\n\nThe pertinent\n\n\ncharacteristics of four radars are summarized in Table 11-17.\n\nRendezvous Radar - This uhit is a derivative of the Apollo IM rendezvous\n\nradar.\n\nA design similar to Tug needs is being defined for the Shuttle program.\n\n\nIt is presumed much of any development required will have been accomplished on\n\nthe Shuttle program.\n\nConsequently, a major advantage of this unit is the minimal\n\n\ndevelopment costs and low risk associated with a flight proven design.\n\nThe radar is a pulsed doppler X-band\' radar with a .9 m (3-foot) casegrain\n\nantenna.\n\nIt will provide a probability of detection (rd) of .99 on a S/C cross\xc2\xad\n\nsection of 10 m 2\n.\n\nAcquisition time at 46 Km (25 n mi) is less than 6 seconds.\n\n\nThe radar design employs a frequency diversity implementation utilizing five\n\nfrequencies spaced 50 MHz apart at X-band.\n\nThis reduces the radar power require\xc2\xad\n\nments and improves the target radar cross-section of the complex target vehicles\n\nconsidered for the space Tug mission.\n\nThe cooperative version requires a trihedral, triangular corner reflector\n\n.24 m (.8\' on a side) on the target vehicle.\n\nIn other respects, it is the same\n\n\nexcept for the expected reduction in power required and correspondingly in the\n\nweight as well.\n\nDual Mode Radar - The dual mode radar incorporates the rendezvous\n\nradar above, both the cooperative and non-cooperative, with a close\xc2\xad\n\n11-36\n\n\nin radar that is essentially new design.\n\nIt is cooperative in all versions.\n\n\nIt utilizes four small RF retroflectors on the target S/C which support the de\xc2\xad\ntermination of range, range rate; LOS and target attitude determination down to\n\n1 TO (3\').\n\nA 9 A\'sec transmitted\'pulse width is employed for this phase and a\n\nwide band receiver is utilized to provide the required high range measurement\n\naccuracy.\n\nAs stated earlier, this close-in capability is a new design, however,\n\n\nit has the advantage of using existing technology hardware.\n\nSome predevelopment\n\n\neffort should be expended in this area to develop an alternative to the laser\n\nradar techniques.\n\n\nSensors\n\nRendezvous Radar\nNoncooperativ\n\nCooperaive\n\nTye\nFrequenq\'\nAngle Tracking\nPea POW\n\nNon-Coherent Pulse-Dapler\nX-Band\nAmpl Componopuls\nM\n42K W\n\nPRIF\nBeanTldth\nSearch Volume\nAntenna\n\nL6KI\n.04 Rad (2.3)\n.52 Rad X.52 RadflXr)\nCassagrain Dual Ref\n\nPulsewitth\n\n1 Sc\n\nAnl Polarization\n\nCircular\n\nDual Mode Radar (Rendezvous Plus Docking)\nNoncooperative Rendez-ous\nCooperatlv\n\nNon-Coherent Pulse-Doppler Non-Coherent Pulse-Doppler\nX-Band\nX-Band\nAmpi Comp onciulse\nM\nAmpi Or Phase Comp onopulse\nM\nWOK\nW\n42K WRendezvous Mode\n\n10WDocking Mode\n\n46L Hz\n.O(Radt 3 )\n.52 Rad X.52\nOadO\nX3\nCassegrain Dual Ref\n\nRecuiver 8 W\nTarge Vehicle\nM\n\nMono-puise Array (Docking)\n\n9.psec (lime Shared\nReceive Mode)\nCircular (Rendezvous)\nLinear (Docking) L.M Hz\nTrihedral,- Triangular Corner\n\nReflector (Rendezvous);

the spin-up requirement should be carefully\n\nassessed before this capability is implemented.\n\nHybrid Soft Dock System:\n\nThis approach (Figure 71-15),\n\nalthough not\n\n\nas well developed as the previous two, incorporates several desirable features.\n\nIt achieves soft docking through the use of a steerable, extendable STEM mounted\n\nprobe (Figure 11-16).\n\nThis probe can be gently inserted in a lightweight space\xc2\xad\n\ncraft mounted drogue using man-in-the-loop video concepts.\n\nThe device then\n\n\ndraws the spacecraft back for a soft attachment to a rigid A-frame structure\n\nattached to the Tug.\n\nThe A-frames can be rotated in or out to match spacecraft\n\n\ndiameter in a variety of ways; perhaps the preferable approach being an adjustable\n\nsquare frame similar to the MDAC approach.\n\nThe A-frame structure need not have\n\n\nthe variable length shock absorbing struts required for an impact docking.\n\nThere\xc2\xad\n\nfore, the A-frames are rigid, singly hinged panels rather than being constructed\n\nfrom universal-jointed struts.\n\nThe impact of this system on the spacecraft is\n\n\nminimal, since the drogue device on the spacecraft can be small and light, and\n\nsince shock loads imparted to the spacecraft will be minimal.\n\nEach of these approaches has some special merit, and some special dis\xc2\xad\nadvantage.\n\nThe square frame approach is light, and has a fair level of development\n\n\nII-43\n\n(374.5 in)\n\n9.4w\nm\n(97.5 in)\n\n-\n\n------\n\n--\xc2\xad\n\n3.0 in)\n6.0 m\n\n5\n\n(234 in)\n\nin\n\n(-(1\n210\nin)\n\nn\n-\n\n-\n\nMultiple Payloads\n\n-\n\n.. .\nFigure 11-14\n\nPIhEflMG PAGE BLANK N\n\nM\n\nCN-51 (Aft)\nEO-59 (Fwd)\n\nMMSE Docking System\ni-45\n\n!-A\n\n\nFigure 11-15\n\nHybrid Soft Dock System\n\n\nShc Absorbers\n\nHinged\nProbe\n\nDrive\nBearing\n\nFigure 11-16\n\nSpring Loaded\nProbe Clamp\n\nFlexure Load\n\nRelief Bearing\n\n\nSteerable STEM Detail\n\n11-47\n\n\nFh~mi~dtf~tAl4\n\nNOT tMM\n\nactivity behind it.\n\nOn the other hand, the structural members involved are com\xc2\xad\n\nplex mechanisms that are not yet qualified.\n\nThe MNSE approach uses a flight\n\n\nproven docking mechanism, and supports retrieval spacecraft flight loads with a\n\nstatic structure.\n\nThe approach, however, appears to be quite heavy.\n\nThe hybrid\n\n\nsoft dock\'approach simplifies the support structure over the MAC approach and\n\neases the spacecraft impacts at the cost of a complex development in the steerable\n\nSTEM probe.\n\nComparative weights were developed for these systems for one par\xc2\xad\n\nticular ap lication (structure designed to carry the spacecraft illustrated in\n\nThe comparative weights were:\n\nFigure 11-14 and -15).\n\nMDAC, 253 kg (556 Ibs);\n\n\nNMSE,441 kg (970 Ibs);

the methods by which rendezvous, inspection, alignment and docking are to\nbe accomplished.\n\nWhen strategies are combined with the requirements of a de\xc2\xad\n\nsired autonomy level and the requirements of particular sensors (Figure 11-17)\nit becomes possible to define implementation algorithms that will effect the\nstrategy in a computer.\n\nThese algorithms divide into decision, maneuver, sensor\n\nutilization and redundancy management algorithms.\nRendezvous Phase - The first rendezvous task is acquisition of the target\nspacedraft.\n\nIn the scenario developed for Tug, this will be accomplished at a\n\nnominal range -of 23 km (12.5 nm) by searching the \'\nof view where the S/C is anticipated to be.\n\n/6 radians\n\n(300) total field\n\nThis procedure will depend on the\n\nsensor mechanization, but will be straightforward in any case.\nSeveral candidate techniques for rendezvous approach have been suggested\n\nin the past (Figure 11-18), but two have received the most attention.\n\nOne of\n\n\nthese is a mechanization of Lambert\'s Theorem which is generally suitable for\n\nthe direction of precise orbital maneuvers intended to efficiently reach the\n\nimmediate vicinity of the target spacecraft.\n\nWith the highly accurate Tug navi\xc2\xad\n\ngation system anticipated,,this type of maneuver is considered to be unnecessary\n\nfor this application.\n\nThe proportional navigation approach, where line-of-sight\n\n\nrates are nulled and the Tug is constrained to follow a prescribed range/range\n\n\nIT-48\n\n\nAutonomy\nConcept\nStrategy -I\nConcepts\n\nmplementation\nAlgorithms\n\n\'\n\n*Inspection\n-DockingManeuvercison\n\nSeDecision\nCharacteristics\n*Video\n*SLR\neRF\n\n*Auxiliary\n\n\n*Alignment\n-Location\n-Maneuver\n\'Docking\n-End Spec\n-Maneuver\nFigure 11-17\n\n*Manual / Automated\n\n*Onboard I Ground\n\n\nAlgorithms\nManeuver Algorithms\n*Sensor Utilization\n*Redundancy Management\n\nOperational Strategies Lead to Implementation Algorithms\n\n\nLambert Type\n\nCandidate echniques\nPursuit Course\nModified Pursuit Course\nJanus Beam Rider\nConstant Beaming Course\nProportional Navigation\nModified Proportional Nav\nace Scheme\n\nFigure I-18\n\nPast\nExperience\n\nOptimal Guidance\nTime Constrained\nAny 8V Direction\nPast Application for\nOrbital Maneuvers\nNew Development\nfor Term RN\n\nProportional Navigation\nF1\nter\nSub-Optimal\nOnboard Calculations\nReal ime (Closed Loop)\nLOS\nExecuted 6V\n\'No Attitude Maneuvers\nTarget Centered Relative\nCoordinates\nSimple Sotware\nimplementation\nDeveloped Guidance\nScheme\n\nPN\nSelected\n\nRendezvous Strategy Selection\n\n\n11-49\n\n\nrate approach profile is considered appropriate.\n\nStudies described in more de\xc2\xad\n\ntail in Section IID of this report volume have shown this to be an efficient\n\nrecommetdatiorf with a,desirable insensitivity to sensor errors.\n\nInspection Phase - The objectives of the inspection phase are to verify\n\nthe spacecraft ready for docking and to locate and maneuver to the docking axis.\n\nA circular inspection maneuver is suggested where the Tug is controlled to always\n\npoint toward the spacecraft so forward pointing sensors can be used.

simulations were used to support analyses of three principal\n\n\nphases of the rendezvous and docking sequence.\n\nThe rendezvous phase was simu\xc2\xad\n\nlated using an existing proportional navigation program that was developed in\n\nsupport of Martin Marietta\'s planetary programs.\n\nDocking closure was simulated\n\n\nusing a new, planar simulation developed under this contract., The dynamics of\n\nimpact docking was simulated with two digital simulation programs.\n\nThe first\n\n\nwas a new simulation developed in support of this contract (under IRAD funds)\n\nthat was designed to quickly identify major parametric relationships.\n\nThe\n\n\nsecond was an existing program, developed under previous MSFC contracts, which\n\n\n11-54\n\n\nwas modified to include propellant slosh modes and a new docking mechanism.\n\nThis subsection summarizes the major results obtained using these simulations.\n\n1.\n\nRendezvous Simulation - PROGRAM RENDZ is a simulation, in three\xc2\xad\n\ndimensional space, of the closure of two vehicles in a central force field\n\nutilizing a proportional navigation scheme.\n\nThis program provides a capability\n\n\nto mechanize the proportional navigation logic in different ways.\n\nThe optioi\n\n\nused in this study was to describe the desired closure relationship as R = K\n\n*2\n\n(R) , and to maintain this relationship with pulses of axial thrusting when a\n\nprescribed deadband is exceeded.\nmonitored.\n\nSimultaneously, line-of-sight rates were\n\n\nWhen these rates exceed a prescribed threshold, a lateral component\n\n\nof thrust is added to the axial thrust to null the sensed line-of-sight rate.\n\nTime of closure for a given set of initial conditions is controlled by setting\n\nthe constant of proportionality relating R and R2.\n\nThis program also provides\n\n\nan ability to study the effects of systematic sensor errors on the closure\n\nmaneuver.\n\nThis capability was modified during thd course of the study to per\xc2\xad\n\nmit the following error types:\n\nRange and range rate measurements - a percentage\n\n\nerror plus a bias error; line-of-sight rate - a percentage error plus a bias\n\nerror; line-of-sight angle - a bias error.\n\nTypical program output for a closure\n\n\nfrom a range of 25 km (12.8 n mi) is shown in Figure 11-23.\n\nThis particular\n\n\nclosure used 55 pulses totaling 7.8 m/sec (22.2 ft/sec) to achieve a closer\n\napproach of 35 meters (115 ft) at a relative velocity of 0.9 m/s (3 ft/sec).\n\nApproximately 2.3 hours was required to effect the closure.\n\nAn empirical relationship between the velocity and the time required\n\nto complete a rendezvous closure was developed by fitting the results of several\n\nclosure simulations at geostationary altitude.\n\nThe precise nature of this\n\n\nrelationship is determined by the area under the prescribed R/i curve, the\n\ninitial closure velocity, the non-linear orbital mechanics effects, the non\xc2\xad\nlinear nature of the ON/OFF control mode and the effects of sensor errors.\n\nIn\n\n\nspite of these fairly involved relationships, an empirical fit accuracy within\n\n0.15

pro\xc2\xad\n\nduced a velocity in the neighborhood of 3 m/sec (10 ft/sec), as compared with a\ntypical 1 m/sec (3 ft/sec) with no sensor errors present.\nThe major conclusions reached from the rendezvous phase analyses are as\n\nfollows:\n\no \tThe proportional navigation algorithm is suitable for directing\n\nrendezvous approach.\n\no \tThis algorithm is insensitive to sensor errors, and rendezvous\n\napproach produces no driving sensor accuracy requirements.\n\no \tGeostationary rendezvous can be effectively performed in 2-2.5\n\nhours with an energy expenditure of less than 7.6 m/sec (25 ft/\n\nsec)\n\no \tThe lack of terminal precision of the rendezvous algorithm\n\nused here suggests that transfer to the inspection algorithm\n\nshould be made at a relative range of at least 180 meters\n\n(600 ft).\n\nThese analyses have verified the suitability of proposed rendezvous\n\nsystem candidates to successfully complete the rendezvous approach phase of\n\nflight.\n\n2.\n\nDocking Simulation - No digital simulation capability for the docking\n\n\nphase existed at the beginning of this study.\n\nInitial plans for relating sensor\n\n\naccuracies and\' operating ranges to docking mechanism requirements called for\n\ngenerating sensitivity relationships and generating appropriate parametric data.\n\nThis was done and is reported in Section IItB of this volume.\n\nIt was felt, both\n\n\nby the NASA COR and the study personnel, that this key phase should be verified\n\nmore rigorously by simulation.\n\nAnalyses of the same problem made in different\n\n\nways would add to the confidence in the results.\n\nAlso, the simulation generated\n\n\nwould be a prototype of an analysis tool-required later in the rendezvous and\n\ndocking development program.\n\nA decision was made in late September to develop\n\n\nsuch a digital simulation program.\n\n11-58\n\n\nThe primary capability required of the program was that it be capable\n\nof simulating all aspects of docking trajectory control that contribute to dis\xc2\xad\npersions at the instant of contact between the Tug and target spacecraft docking\n\nmechanisms.\n\nAt the same time, the program should run rapidly enough to permit\n\n\nMonte Carlo simulation of the varied\n\nnon-linear contributions to these dis\xc2\xad\n\npersions.\n\nThe contributors to contact dispersion that required simulation included\n\nthe following:\n\no \tAttitude and translation control implemefited by pulsing RCS\n\nnozzles in accordance with a phase-plane logic.\n\no \tRigid Body Dynamics.\n\no \tSensor errors in the measurement of relative position and\n\nattitude, and the derivation of rate information from these\n\nmeasurements.\n\no \tThe loss of certain measurements as the docking vehicles approach\n\ntoo closely for the sensors to function.\n\no \tThe performance characteristics of simplified maneuver control\n\nalgorithms.\n\no \tThe effect of offset centers of gravity, probe rotation arm,\n\ntranslation/attitude loop cross-coupling and differential\n\ngravity effects.\n\nI\n\n\nThe general nature of a simulation capable of addressing these require\xc2\xad\nments is illustrated in Figure 11-25.\n\nThe program\n\nis\n\na\n\nplanar simulation.\n\n\nIt uses the baseline Tug attitude phase-plane logic and the indicated transla\xc2\xad\ntion control logic to make ON/OFF decisions for each of the 24 RCS n6zzles used.\n\nThe steering logic incorporated in the program is very simple, but has proven\n\neffective.\n\nThis version of the program simulates impact docking approach.\n\n\nGeneration of such a simulation is not unusual, but the desire to make the pro\xc2\xad\ngram run rapidly made the problem somewhat unique.\n\nMost existing phase-plane\n\n\nsimulations readily available run in the ne ghborhood of real-time.\n\nThis would\n\n\nbe much to slow for economical Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n\t\n\n11-59\n\nO K

Second, an elaborate control of computation cycles was\n\ndeveloped. The flight computer used to implement the dodking maneuver will\n\nquired.\n\noperate on two computational intervals. \n The minor cycle, using an interval of\n\nThe\n\nabout 0.020 seconds, will handle the attitude control phase-planA logic.\nmajor cycle of about 1.00 seconds will handle navigation calculations and direct\n\nthe translation control loop. \n In this simulation, these two computational\'in\xc2\xad\nternals and a third longer interval (a simulation speeding \'coast\' interval)\n\nthe longest of these intervals whenever\n\nare implemented.

their individual effects.\n\nThe results were somewhat inconclusive, since\n\n\nthe effects were masked by the deadband effects of the Tug control systems.\n\nAbout\n\n\nall that could be discerned was that the-system could cope, with varying degrees\n\nof success, with all the variables.\n\nOne not surprising result was that the ability\n\n\nto derive lateral velocity became quite important when it was coupled with a loss\n\nof measurement at a large distance from the target spacecraft.\n\nIn any event, it was decided that this simulation should be run in a\n\nMonte Carlo mode, where random selections of input variables were run individually,\n\nand the net result observed to determine statistical effects.\n\nAccordingly, the\n\n\nfollowing variables were selected for random variation:\n\no\n\nFive sensor errors (RGER, TAERD, LOSERD, VVER, VHER)\n\nO\n\nFive initial conditions (k, Y, Y, 9, 9)\n\n\nAn input of a 3-sigma variation in these parameters is accepted in a

impact attenuation mechanism design for both Tug and\n\nspacehraft, possible requirements for limiting large amplitude fluid mo\xc2\xad\ntions, and pre- and post-latch control system requirements.\n\nThis section\n\n\ndetails the two-phase approach to docking dynamics analysis that was de\xc2\xad\nveloped, validated and implemented during the course of these studies\n\nand summarizes the numerical investigation .\n\nA complete description of\n\n\nthe analyses and supporting digital computer programs appears in Volume\n\nIV - Supporting Analyses.\n\n\nDuring the early stages of the study, it was established that the\n\noriginally proposed plan to use the Martin Marietta developed digital\n\ncode for detailed docking analyses (IMPLES) would not provide a cost effec\xc2\xad\ntive approach due to the long computer running times associated with this\n\ndigital code combined with the fact that the impact attenuation mechanism,\n\nTug flexible body properties and control system logic were not suffici\xc2\xad\nently defined to warrant such a detailed investigation.\n\nIt was there\xc2\xad\n\nfore decided to implement a two-phase approach to problem solution where\n\nPhase I would provide a new analytical tool to be used to examine the\n\ntotal dynamical system in the large and Phase II would use a modification\n\nof the IMPRES code for a selected few impact analyses.\n\nBoth analytical\n\n\ntools incorporate an analog to simulate large amplitude fluid excursions\n\nand provide an assessment of vehicle and fluid motions as well as defini\xc2\xad\ntion of interface forces realized during a docking maneuver.\n\nThe Phase I approach is structured such that the total dynamical\n\nsystem (including Tug structure, propulsion tanks, spacecraft and attenu\xc2\xad\nation mechanisms) is considered to be an assembly of interconnected sub\xc2\xad\nstructures.\n\nThe entire system (or portions thereof) may be spinning or\n\n\nnonspinning and individual bodies of the system are capable ,of undergoing\n\nlarge relative excursions with respect to each other.\n\nThe system is, by\n\n\nits nature, a feedback sy-stem wherein inertial forces (e.g., centrifugal\n\nand Coriolis accelerations) and restoring and damping forces are motion\n\n\nI-67\n\n\ndependent.\n\nA control system may be included to actively control posi\xc2\xad\n\ntion and rate error through use of reaction control jets, servomotors,\n\n,or momentum wheels.\n\nThe bodies of the system are interconnected via\n\n\nlinear or nonlinear springs and dashpots, by gimbal/slider block combina\xc2\xad\ntions, or a combination of the above.\n\nAny two bodies may be free (one\n\n\nfrom the other) with six degrees of relative motion freedom and, addi\xc2\xad\ntionally, any or all of the six degrees of freedom between two bodies\n\nmay be controlled as an explicitly prescribed function of time.\n\nWith reference to Figure Il-30, the\n\nmechanical\n\nsystem\n\ncon\xc2\xad\n\nsists of six bodies which are connected to form a composite two-body\n\nsystem where the composite Tug vehicle consists of the Tug

masses and the composite\n\nspacecraft consists of the vehicle and its associated attenuation mechan\xc2\xad\nism.\n\nThe attenuation mechanisms may have one or more relative degrees\n\n\nof freedom with respect to their associated vehicles to simulate the\n\nstiffness and damping effects of attachment structure; the fluid mass\n\npendulums have three relative degrees of freedom with respect to the Tug\n\nstructure.\n\nA fixed length pendulum analog simulates the mass associated with\n\nthe liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants.\n\nThis is equivalent to\n\n\nspecifying that the propellants are constrained to move as a point mass\n\non a spherical surface; the radius of the sphere being adjustable with\n\nvarious tank fill levels (the lower the fill level, the larger the equiva\xc2\xad\nlent radius).\n\nThis assumption of a spherical constraint surface is not\n\n\nunduly restrictive in view of the known Tug tank geometry.\n\nThe Phase II approach was centered about the Martin Marietta de\xc2\xad\nveloped TMPRES code" as modified to consider the effects of large ampli\xc2\xad\ntude fluid motions.\n\nIn this formalism the Tug (chase vehicle), space\xc2\xad\n\ncraft (target vehicle), and their associated docking/attenuation mechanisms\n\nare considered as separate entities.\n\nEither vehicle may be characterized\n\n\nas a rigid or flexible body and may be spinning or nonspinning.\n\nA signifi\xc2\xad\n\ncand feature is the definition of the attenuation mechanisms which are\n\nmodeled as an assembly of interconnected rigid links (elements) which are\n\nin turn connected by linear or nonlinear springs and/or dashpots and which\n\nmay experience large relative excursions with respect to each other.\n\nThe\n\n\ntotal mechanism is then assembled from a library of geometric shapds in\xc2\xad\ncluding rods, tubes, cones, spheres, helixes, etc.\n\nIn this manner the\n\n\nanalyst may describe a physical system in great detail as

large amplitude fluid motion analog that is considerably more\n\ngeneral than the analog developed under Phase I.\n\nHere the fluid is again\n\n\nassumed to move as a point mass on a constraint surface but the surface\n\nis assumed ellipsoidal. This analog was originally developed by Martin\n\n\nIIL--f\n\nMarietta Corporation and has been shown to yield excellent correlation\n\nwith experimental data .\n\nA modification to the basic equations of motion\n\n\nwas necessary to implement the analog; the technique is summarized in\n\nVolume IV - Supporting Analyses.\n\nThe intent of the numerical studies was to establish those sys\xc2\xad\ntem parameters which most influence the docking maneuver and to isolate\n\npotential problem areas that might require further or extended investi\xc2\xad\ngation.\n\nSeveral system characterizing parameters were selected for in\xc2\xad\n\nvestigation studies performed to establish gross effects and relative\n\nsensitivity of the response to variations in the parameters.\n\n-The possibility of large amplitude fluid excursions and the re\xc2\xad\nsulting effect upon the maneuver was defined to be of major interest as\n\nwere the effects of variations in Tug tank fill level and variations in\n\ntime to execute the maneuver.\n\nVariations in attachment structure stiff\xc2\xad\n\nness and damping characteristics were felt to be of lesser importance\n\nas were variations in spacecraft inertial characteristics and the initial\n\nposition of propellants within the tanks.\n\nSeveral important and interesting conclusions were established as\xc2\xad\na result of the numerical studies.\n\nSome of these conclusions are sig\xc2\xad\n\nnificant with respect to the impact docking maneuver itself; others are\n\nsignificant with respect to post-latch system requirements. "\n\nThe effects of propellant motions, in that the propellant masses\n\ncombine to represent (for nominal burn conditions) a large fraction of\n\nthe total system mass, are appreciable when the entire maneuver including\n\npost-latch vehicle motions is considered.\n\nFor nominal time to execute\n\n\nthe impact, closure and latch condition, the resulting propellant excur\xc2\xad\nsions are seen to be relatively small as would be expected.\n\nThese ex\xc2\xad\n\ncursions are on the order of a few degrees and do not significantly affect\n\nthe total system dynamic response or resultant interface load requirements.\n\n\n*\t\n\nExperimental Study of Transidnt Liquid Motion in Orbiting Spacecraft,\nMCR-75-4, Martin Marietta Corporation, February 1975.\n11-7]\n\nOn the other hand, nominal acceleration profiles resulting from nominal\n\ninitial offsets andrates, are shown to yield relatively large residual\n\npropellant rates which may have (over long periods of time) a signifi\xc2\xad\ncan-t effect upon post-latch system motions and may well impact Tug con\'\n\ntrol system requirements,\n\nThis would indicate that some form of propellant\n\n\nmanagement device.(perhaps tank baffles) may be required.\n\nFurther studies\n\n\nin this area appear warranted.\n\nOf major concern to the attenuation mechanism designer is the\n\naccommodation of interface loads; a measure of which was es-tablished\n\nthrough examination of representative Tug/spacecraft impact maneuvers.\n\nAn\n\n\nApollo/Skylab-type probe/drogue mechanism and representative initial con\xc2\xad\nditions and Tug propellant fill conditions were employed in several simu\xc2\xad\nlations.\n\nThe results indicate that the docking interface forces and torques\n\n\nare relatively insensitive to spacecraft inertial characteristics and Tug\n\nfill level but are quite sensitive to the relative vehicle rates at impact,\n\nincreasing markedly with increasing impact velocity.\n\nHowever, the re\xc2\xad\n\nsultant interface load levels are, in general, rather moderate and probably\n\nwill not be critical to mechanism design.\n\nShould this not prove to be the\n\n\ncase, some means of Tug translational control during the capture phase\n\n(with resultant increase in time from initial impact to final latch) may\n\nbe used to alleviate undesirable loading conditions.\n\nIt must be pointed\n\n\nout here that these studies considered no flexible-body properties of\n\neither vehicle and therefore there is no measure available of the dynamic\n\nresponse of spacecraft solar panels or other flexible appendages.\n\nIf,\n\n\nfor given class of spacecraft, it becomes necessary to maintain structural\n\nintegrity during the docking maneuver, the analyses should be extended\n\nto consider vehicle flexibility and the possible requirement for stowage\n\nof the flexible appendages.\n\n\n11-72\n\nIII.\n\nSYSTEM SELECTION\n\nThis section will result in recommended configurations for a manual, an\n\n\nautonomous and a hybrid rendezvous and docking system for the Space Tug.\nconfiguration will be discussed individually.\nbe presented:\n\n(1) a strategy, or sequence\n\nEach\n\n\nFor each, the following data will\n\n\nof events, (2) a brief description\n\n\nof the candidates that were configured for evaluation, (3) criteria used for the\n\nevaluation process, (4) the method by which the candidates were ranked, (5) the\n\nresults of the ranking in the form of the best three candidates and rationale\n\nfor their selection, and finally (6) a more detailed description of the best\n\ncandidate, including cost estimates.\n\nA.\n\nMANUAL CONFIGURATION\n\nThe strategy adopted for the non-impact manual configuration, in the\n\n\nform of a sequence of events, is as follows:\n\n1)\n\nSequence starts with ranging sensor acquisition at 23 Km (12.5 n mi).\n\n2)\n\nRanging sensor data is used to perform terminal rendezvous to\nstationkeeping at inspection range of\nmonitors the TV image.\n\n\'\n\n30 m (100 ft) while ground\n\nTug attitude is controlled from sensor\n\nLOS data.\n3)\n\nThe ground initiates inspection (preprogrammed or manual lateral\ntranslation of known duration and direction).\n\nIt is assumed\n\nthe docking port attitude is known.\n4)\n\nThe ranging sensor corrects LOS during inspection.\n\nThe\n\nground monitors and can back it up if acquisition is lost,\nor whatever.\n5)\n\nManual +X thrusting is used to correct for orbit\'s normal\nacceleration.\n\n6)\n\nThe docking port.is located visually.\n\n7)\n\nThe ground manually stops the inspection orbit (reverse\nlateral thrusting).\n\n8)\n\nThe crew manually aligns to the docking port axis by per\xc2\xad\nforming lateral thrusting, using an offset T as a cue, while\n\nIII-I\n\n\nthe ranging sensor and/or manual ground commands, maintain\n\nLOS on the target.\n\nThe Tug is now in an inertial attitude\n\n\nhold mode unless overriden by manual or sensor generated\n\ncommands.\n\n9)\n\nIf all looks well; e.g., lighting, spacecraft stability,\n\netc., a predetermined (from Tug mass, ACS thtust, etc.)\n\ntranslation is manually commanded to achieve N .3 m (1 fps)\n\nclosing velocity.\n\n\n10)\n\nThe ranging sensor monitors and trims that velocity during the\n\nfirst few seconds.\n\nIt could also command it, if desired,\n\n\nwith manual command as a backup.\n\n11) \t As the vehicle closes, the ground monitors range and range\n\nrate data from the ranging sensor on a TV screen.\n\nVehicle\n\n\nlateral thrusting is commanded to align the offset\xc2\xb0"T"\n\ntarget on the spacecraft (ACS pulsing would be in a minimum\n\nimpulse mode.\n\nThe number desired would be determined by\n\n\ncrew judgment based on the "T" offset and range).\n\nThe Tug\n\n\nattitude is maintained by ranging sensor LOS data to the\n\ncorner reflector until that is not accurately available.\nthat\n\ntime GN&C inertial attitude hold is maintained.\n\nAt\n\n\nRanging\n\n\nsensor range and range rate data is lost at tv.9 to 3 m (3 - 10 ft).\n\nManual lateral translation corrections may still be sent, based on\n\noffset "T" viewing, but few are likely since less than 10 seconds\n\nremain until docking\n\nVx = .3 m/sec (1 ft/sec)\n\n\n12)\n\nDocking occurs; spacecraft attitude control is deactivated.\n\n\n13)\n\nMechanism contact monitoring is conducted.\n\n\n14)\n\nHard latch is commanded.\n\n\nThe non-impact manual configuration is the same as the impact docking\n\nfor the rendezvous and inspection phases; Steps 1 through 8 in the prev-ious\n\nsequence, but from there to docking the following steps are followed:\n\n9) \tIf all looks well; e.g., lighting, spacecraft stability, etc., a\n\npredetermined translation is manually commanded to achieve\n\nn .15 m/s (.5 fps) closing velocity.\n\n111-2\n\n\n10)\n\nThe ranging sensor will monitor and trim this velocity during\n\nthe first few seconds (it may even initiate it).\n\nRange and\n\n\nrange rate data will be provided to the ground along with TV\n\npictures.\n\nAt predetermined range gates, the range rate will be\n\n\nreduced manually based on precalculated thrusting durations.\n\n11) \t Range rate equals 0.0 m/s at .9 - 1.5 m (3 - 5 foot) range.\n\nThe\n\n\nman will continue to monitor the visual display to ensure a\n\nstationkeeping mode.\n\n12) \t The ranging sensor will maintain the LOS automatically, or it\n\ncan be provided manually.\n\n13) \t Docking axes co-alignment will be provided by lateral thrusting\n\ncommands from the ground based on an offset "T" or similar TV\n\ntarget.\n\nConsequently, a target attitude determination capa\xc2\xad\n\nbility will not be provided.\n\nRange sensor range and range-rate\n\n\ndata is highly desirable at close-in ranges to provide more\n\ncontinuous and real time data on the ground for monitoring to\n\nsee that stationkeeping continues to be maintained within a\n\nfairly rigid band during STEM insertion.\n\n14) \t On verification of stable stationkeeping, a separate ground con\xc2\xad\ntroller will command extension of the STEM.\n\n15) \t Observing the TV picture (once each 16 seconds or less),\n\nthe STEM\n\n\nwill be inserted into the drogue by commanding STEM pitch, yaw,\n\nand extend/retract commands.,\n\n16) \t On receipt of a STEM contact signal, the tug will maintain its\n\nattitude at the time of contact and the vehicles will\n\nslowly be\n\n\ndrawn together by manual control of the STEM.\n\n17)\n\nSoft contact is monitored.\n\n\n18)\n\nAt contact the hard dock latches are commanded closed and the\n\ntarget vehicle control system is disabled.\n\n\nBased on these sequences, candidates were configured from the hardware\n\ncomponents presented in Section II.C.\n\nAll combinations of hardware elements\n\n\nthat \t\nmet the requirements of IA and B were considered.\n\nThe resulting list of\n\n\n19 candidates is shown in Table III-1.\n\n\n111-3\n\nTable lUI-l.\n\nManual Candidate Summary\n\n\nWeight -Kg\nCandi-\n\ndate\n\nSensor\n\nDocking\n\nMechanism\n\n(Lb)\n\nTV\n\njMechanism\n\nR&R Sensor\n\nLights\n\nPower\n\nSensor\n\nTV\n\n\nMI\nM2\nM3\n\nGaAs SLR\nTV\n\nMDAC\nMME\nNon-Impact\n\n252 (556)\n440 (970)\n241 (531)\n\n25\n25\n25\n\n9 (20)\n9 (20)\n9 (20)\n\n40\n40\n40\n\n12\n\n12\n\n12\n\n\nM4\nM5\nM6\n\nC02 Laser\n(Non-Cooperative)\nTV\n\nMAC\nMMSE\nNon-Impact\n\n252 (556)\n440 (970)\n241 (531)\n\n9 (20)\n22.7 (50)\n9 (20)\n11.7 (50)\n22.7 (50), r 9 (20)\n\n200\n200\n200\n\n12\n\n12\n\n12\n\n\nM7\nM8\nM9\n\n002 Laser\n(Cooperative)\nTV\n\nMAC\nMMSE\nNon-Impact\n\n252 (556)\n440 (970)\n241 (531)\n\n18\n18\n18\n\n(40) i 9 (20)\n(40) 1 9 (20)\n9 \'(20)\n(40)\n\n100\n100\n\n12\n\n12\n\n12\n\n\nM10\nMIl\n\nRend.

Rationale for each of\n\nthe weighting factors is provided below.\n\n1.\n\nManual Candidate Evaluation - The evaluation matrix for the manned\n\n\ncandidates is shown in Table 111-2 for each of the 19 manual candidates in\n\nTable III-1.\n\nThe first column for each candidate is a rating (R) for that\n\ncandidate, while the second is a value (V) obtained from the rating multiplied\n\nby the weighting factor.\n\nThe rationale for the weighting factors is provided\n\n\nin (a) below and rationale for the ratings in (b).\nbe grouped in three categories:\n\nThe criteria can generally\n\n\n(1) those that are Tug design related, (2)\n\n\nthose that are S/C related and, finally, (3) mission and operations oriented\n\ncriteria.\n\nIn assigning weighting factors to the criteria, it has been assumed\n\n\nthat the rendezvous and docking system is really provided as a service to the\n\nS/C community, therefore, those factors that enhance attractiveness to the\n\nspacecraft, Group 2, are weighted highest.\n\na.\n\nWeighting Rationalew-\n\n\nMechanism Weight - Mechanism weights are large and vary widely so they\n\nare important, but they impact the Tug design only, not S/C or mission. Con\xc2\xad\nsequently, a weighting of 2 is assigned.\n\nS&nsor Weights - The deviations in weight from sensor to sensor are less\n\nthan half those of the mechanism; consequently, a weight of I was assigned.\n\nPower - Only the sensors really require any power.\n\nThere are some\n\n\nreasonably large differences from sensor to sensor, but none appear to be\n\nbeyond accommodation in a Tug power subsystem design, therefore, a I was assigned.\n\nDevelopment Risk - Some candidate systems contain features or hardware\n\nthat present greater risks in developing successfully. These reflect in higher\n\ncosts but, in addition, raise concerns among the program management and potential\n\nusers as to flight worthiness at the promised flight date.\n\nThis is a far-reaching\n\n\nconcern, but the anticipated lead times before the first flight for the Tug\n\nshould allow considerable reduction of most risks; consequently, a 2 was assigned.\n\n\n111-5\n\n\nTable 111-2\n\nManual Candidate Evaluation\n\n\nH\n\nHw\n\n\ne\n\nH\'\n\nCANDIDATE\n\n\n0t\n0\n0.\n\nh\ng\n\nEvaluation\nCriteria\n\nM1 tM2\n\nM3\n\n-\n\nM4\n\nt RVRVRVR\n\nM5\n\n-\n\nM6\n\n-\n\nV R\n\nM7-\n\n-\n\nM48\n\nM9\n\nM10_\n\n_\n\nV R V R VRV\nR V\n\n_\nMi\n\n-\n\nM12-\n\nM13\n\nM14\n\nM15\n\n-M16\n\nM17\n\nMI8\n-\n\n-\n\nM19 _\n\nR V R V R V R V A V R V R V R V R V\n\n2 4 8 1 2 4 8 4 8 1 2 4 8 4 8 1 2 4 8 4 8 4 8 4 8 4 8 4 8 1 2 4 8 4 8 1 2 4 8\n1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 212 2 2 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3\n1 5 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nFMechanism Weight\nSensor Weight\nPower\nDevelopment Risk\nMission Success\nProbability\n\n\n2 3 6 3 6 3 61 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 4 2 4 2 4 5 10 5 10 5 10 4 8 4 8 4 8 4 814 8\n2 4 8 4 8 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10 3 6 3 6 3 6 3 6 5 10 5 10 5 10 5 10\n\nSoftware OperaMission\n\n2 4 8 4 8 3 6 4 8 4 8 3 6 4 8 4 8 3 6 4 8 4 8 4 8 4 8 4 8 4 8 3 6 4 8 4 I\n 3 6\n\n8\n\ntions (Complex.) 2 3 6 3 6 2 4 3 613\nServicing Poten-\n\n3 3 9 2 6 5 15\n\nSpinning Spacecraft Compat.\n\n\n2 4 8 4 8 2 4 484\n\n5 10\n\n\n6 2 4 3 6 3 6 2 4 4 8 4 8 4 8 4 8 3 6 3 6 2 4 3 6 3 6 2 4\n\n\n3 9 2 6 515\n8\n\n3 9 2 6 515\n\n2 4 4 8 4 8 24\n\nSpacecraftlIm3 3 93 9412 39 3 9412 3 93 9412\npact-Struct.I\nI\nSpacecraftlm2484848510510510484848510-5101212484848\npact-Cues\nGrounuOperations 1\n32\n3\n3\n2\n3\n3 \n 2\n3\nGronde\n\n4 8 4 8\n\n5 10\n\n3 9 2 6 3 9 3 9 3 9 2 6 515\n\n3 5 2 6 515\n\n\n4 8 4 84848484824484824\n\n\n39\n\n3939\n\n3 93\n\n93\n\n94\n\n123 9 3 9412\n12 1212\n\n3\n2\n32\n3\n2\n3\n3\n2\n3\nrain \n 3 3 2 2 3 31 3 3 2 2 31 3 3 3 221 3 3 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 \'2 3 3 2 2 3 3 3 3 2 2 3 3\n\n1\n\n(GSE)\n\nRecurring Cost\n\n2 3 6 2 4 316\n\nNonrecurring Cost2 3 64\n\nTOTAL\n\n95\n\nDocking\n\n2 4\n\n1 2 2 4 2 4 1 2 2 4-5 10\n\n8 2 4 1 2 1 2 1 21 1\n\n95\n\n84\n\n1\n\n84\n\nU,\n\n4 8\n\n5 10\n\n4\n\n4 8 3 6 4\n\n510\n\n510\n\n510\n\n4 8 510\n\n97\n\n98\n\n95\n\nW\n\n72\n\n87\n\n87\n\n75\n\n88\n\n103\n\n97\n\nSensor\nGroup\n\nSLR (Coop.)\nTV\n\nE\nCO Laser\n(Ngncoop.)\n\nCO Laser\n(C9 p.)\n0\n\nTV\n\nTV\nSTV\n\nI\n\nless important; 3 - more important\n\n\nR - Rating, 1\n\n=\n\npoor; 5\n\n=\n\ngood\n\n\nV - Value which isweight x rating\n\n\n87\n\n4\n\n3 6 4 8\n\n\n3 6 4 8 5 10\n\n96\n\n94\n\n84\n\n3 6\n\n92\n\n,\n\n\' r\n\nMechanism\n\nNOTES:\n\nWeight:\n\n1 2 1 2 510\n\nRend.

consequently, no more than a 2 is justified.\n\nMission Operations -\n\nrn\n\nthis evaluation this relates primarily to the\n\n\ncomplexity of the ground operations required to support the vehicle during rendez\xc2\xad\nvous and docking;

consequently, should be weighted\n\nequally unless there are programmatic reasons why funding for one or the\n\nother will be particularly difficult to obtain in a given time frame.\n\nThe down\xc2\xad\n\nstream scheduling of Tug does not currently provide any insight into such\n\nproblems.\nb.\n\nA 2 was assigned to both criteria.\n\n\nRating Rationale - Some gener4l\n\nfeatures and characteristics were evident\n\n\nthat influenced the ratings in Table 111-2.\n\nThey are summarized below.\n\n\nDocking Mechanism - The MDAC square frame is a medium weight, relatively\n\ncomplex scheme that is not currently developed.\n\nIt is basically an impact sys\xc2\xad\n\ntem, not ideal for servicing, but a capability for docking with spinning\n\nsatellites is feasible.\n\nThe HMSE is a very heavy scheme, but does use some developed hardware;\n\nthe Apollo probe and drogue.\n\nIt is less suited to servicing than the MDAC.\n\n\nThe non-impact device with a STEM probe is a medium weight.\n\nIt is\n\n\nideally suited to servicing, though not to spinning spacecraft retrieval.\na paper design only.\n\nIt is\n\n\nIt has a higher risk regarding mission success-and a\n\n\ngreater mission operations complexity for the manual configuration because of\n\nthe additional control required from the ground for STEM articulation, as well\n\nas close-in vehicle stationkeeping.\n\nThe software requirements are slightly\n\n\nhigher.\n\nSensors - There are seven sensor groups, each of which has a TV for the\n\nclosure and docking operation.\n\nThree of the sensor groups are merely coopera\xc2\xad\n\ntive versions of the RF rendezvous radar, CO2 laser radar and the dual mode\n\n(close-in and far-out) RF radar.\n\nThe only real difference between the coopera\xc2\xad\n\ntive and non-cooperative is that the latter has the advantage of requiring no\n\nreflectors on the target for ranging.\n\nIn all cases, however, the power (and\n\n\nconsequently the weight) of the non-cooperative versions is higher.\nSLR does not have the power capability for a non-cooperative mode.\n\n\n11I-8\n\n\nThe GaAs\n\n\nthe RF rendezvous radar is an Apollo program developed unit.\n\nThe dual\n\n\nmode RF radar, however, includes a close-in capability which has not been de\xc2\xad\nveloped.\n\nThe CO 2 laser is complex and has no real development, to date.\n\nThe\n\n\nGaAs SLR is relatively complex also, but has been under development for some\n\ntime.\n2.\n\nIt has not flown in space.\n\nSelection - From the 19 candidates, the three highest ranked are shown\n\n\nbelow in Table 111-3.\n\n\nTable 111-3.\n\nHighest Ranked Manual Candidates\n\n\nRank\nSensors\n\nMechanism\n\nRF Rendezvous Radar\n\nMDAC Square Frame\n\n(Score)\n\n(103)\n\n(Non-cooperative)\n\nand TV\nMI\n2\n(96)\n\nDual Mode RF Radar\n(Non-cooperative)\nand TV\n\nNon-Impact System\n\n144\n\n3\n\nGaAs SLR and TV\n\n(95)\n\nNon-Impact System\nMl\n\nAn evaluation score generated in the manner illustrated is not sufficient\n\njustification alone for corroborate ranking.\n\nThere is additional rationale that\n\n\ncorroborates the above selection\n\nThe RF rendezvous radar/TV sensor package was ranked No. 1, primarily\n\ndue to the developed state of the sensors.\nmized as are cue impact on the S/C.\n\nCosts and development risks are mini\xc2\xad\n\n-One concern with this candidate is the heavy\n\n\nload on the TV and man to accomplish the final docking phases with no real back\xc2\xad\nups available.\n\nThere is not as much growth to greater accuracy or other\n\n\nperformance capability, but it does meet the established requirements and for\n\nwhat is probably a significantly lower cost than the other candidates.\n\nThe remaining two candidates are potentially more capable, but are more\n\ncostly as well." Both utilize the non-impact docking mechanism, thus providing\n\nsomewhat improved accommodation for servicing, which the first one does not.\n\n111-9\n\n\nBoth have the capability of providing target attitude data, if necessary.\nredundancy is inherent, however, more development is required as well.\n\nMore\n\n\nThe latter\n\n\ncandidates do not require total dependence on the ground for commands, nor do\n\nthey require TV algorithms to derive range data.\n\nThere is more flexibility in\n\n\nimplementing vehicle control as more reliable data is available to work with to\n\nprovide some backup control in the event of ground link data loss.\n\n3.\n\nLescription - Figure III-i pictorially shows the elements of the highest\n\n\nranked manual candidates.\n\nThe interface with other Tug electronics is shown as\n\n\nwell as the software programs required in the Tug computer.\n\nA detailed descrip\xc2\xad\n\ntion of all software routines is provided in the autonomous candidate description,\n\nPart B.\n\nRefer to the applicable software routine descriptions in that part.\n\nThe RF rendezvous radar needs no cues; it ranges on skin track data.\n\n\nThe TV will utilize target outline and centroid data computations for LOS and\n\nrange information.\n\nThe only S/C cue is an offset "T" or similar cue for pro\xc2\xad\n\nviding target attitude misalignment and LOS data to the ground via TV.\n\nThe\n\n\nunique TV algorithms that compute target information from imaging data are im\xc2\xad\nplemented in a small 2K word microprocessor contained on one or two boards in\n\nthe TV electronics.\n\nThis minimizes Tug computer software and maintains a simple\n\n\nuniform interface between the rendezvous and docking system and the mother\n\nvehicle;

The ground also has the capability of manually performing the entire\n\nsequence, thereby providing redundancy of a functional form.\n\nThis is desirable\n\n\nsince it provides protection against generic type of failures.\n\nsystem, then, is basically autonomous with manual control of sequenc\xc2\xad\nThe \t\ning.\n\nWhere relatively complex autonomous tasks were identified in the autonomous\n\n\nconfiguration, however, such as docking port recognition, the task has been left\n\nto the man on the ground.\n\nThe detailed sequence of events for this impact dock\xc2\xad\n\ning \t\nconfiguration is:\n\nI) \tThe sequence starts at automatic target acquisition at 23 km (12.5 n mi).\n\n2) \tRendezvous to the stationkeeping point is accomplished autonomously\n\nusing ranging sensor range, range rate, and LOS data.\n\nThe ground\n\n\nmonitors this phase on TV.\n\n3) \tGround monitors satisfactory accomplishment of stationkeeping and\n\nprovides a "go" for orbit inspection (possibly selecting an optimum\n\norbit from a presotred library of them).\n\n\n11-28\n\n4)\n\nThe orbit inspection is computed and initiated onboard based on\n\nrange and prestored desired orbit period.\n\n\n5)\n\nLOS is being maintained autonomously throughout.\n\n\n6)\n\nThe docking port is sighted manually.\n\n\n7)\n\nWhen it is within range of the onboard attitude determination capa\xc2\xad\nbility, the orbit inspection is stopped by ground command, the\n\ninitial orbit insertion A V is automatically removed, and station\xc2\xad\nkeeping is assumed.\n\n\n8)\n\nThe Tug ranging sensor computes the target attitude with respect to\n\nthe Tug and displays it on the ground.\n\n\n9)\n\nAfter a "go!\' from the ground, the maneuver required for X-axis co\xc2\xad\nalignment is calculated and executed in the form of translation\n\ncommands, with LOS to the spacecraft maintained automatically.\n\nThe\n\n\nground monitors the maneuver and can take over in the event of\n\nanomalous conditions.\n\n10)\n\nAfter coalignment is accomplished, another "go" from the ground\n\ninitiates the closure phase.\n\n\n11) \t A closing\n\nV of I fps is imparted using a prestored +X jet on-time.\n\n\nThis is monitored onboard and trimmed automatically using sensor\n\nrange rate data.\n\n12) \t LOS to the spacecraft is maintained until approximately .3 m (I foot).\n\n13) \t The Tug continues to compute target attitude to verify vehicle X\n\naxes coalignment.\n\n14) \t If lateral position error is detected, translation commands are com\xc2\xad\nputed and executed to maintain coalignment automatically until target\n\nattitude information is lost at approximately 3 m (10 ft).\n\n15)\n\nThroughout this phase the ground is monitoring the closure on TV\n\n(both image and range, range rate, and LOS data from ranging the\n\nsensor) and has the capability to take over from the Tug control\n\nsystem and complete the closure manually at any time.\n\n\n111-29\n\n\n16)\n\nDocking occurs; spacecraft attitude control is deactivated.\n\n\n17)\n\nMechanism contact omintoring is conducted.\n\n\n18)\n\nHard latch is commanded.\n\n\nThe hardware elements selected for the hybrid system are:\n\no\n\nGaAs SLR\n\n\no\n\nTV\n\n\no\n\nImpact Docking Mechanism (MAC square frame)\n\n\nThe rationale for that selection is as follows:\n\nRanging Sensor - The GaAs SLR was chosen because it can autonomously pro\xc2\xad\nvide both ranging data and target attitude information with basically the same\n\nhardware; only the cues are expanded and some software is added.\n\nThe RF candi\xc2\xad\n\ndate utilizes a different concept altogether for attitude determination,adding\n\nhardware development.\n\nThe SLR is also relatively light and low-power.\n\nThe ex\xc2\xad\n\ntended range capability the CO2 SLR could provide is not required in the present\n\nscenario that show acquisition at 23 km (12.5 n mi).\n\nUtilization of the TV for\n\n\nranging is not practical due to ranging limitations.\n\nIt is more useful in a\n\n\nbackup role for docking only.\n\nSome development has already been done on the GaAs SLR.\n\nVisual Sensor - A TV is provided for monitoring the autonomous operations\n\nand furnishing a capability for manual control of the vehicle in a backup mode.\n\nDocking Mechanism - An impact mechanism was selected, as it was for the\n\nother candidates, because\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nadditional complexity\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nstation\xc2\xad\n\nkeeping control mode and steerable probe control of a non-impact device.\n\nServic\xc2\xad\n\ning is, of course, not readily achievable with the impact system, but for this\n\nstudy was not a requirement.\n\nThe MDAC mechanism is currently recommended as it\n\n\nis reasonably lightweight and shows some growth potential to a servicing role\n\nand to spinning spacecraft retrieval.\n\nThe hybrid configuration is depicted in Figure 111-6.\n\nIt is much the\n\n\nsame as the autonomous candidate in that it utilizes the same docking mechanism,\n\n\n111-30\n\n\nthe same ranging sensor - GaAs SLR - and the same basic ranging cues.\n\nA TV for\n\n\nmanual backup control and decision making has been added, however, this has\n\n,allowed some reduction in software required; specifically the abort recogni\xc2\xad\nA\n\n\ntion, abort command routines and the docking port recognition routine.\n\ndetailed description of software routines for all configurations is provided\n\nunder the autonomous configuration description, Part B of this section.\n\nRefer\n\n\nto the applicable routines described in that section.\n\n\nDocking Mechanism\n\nS\'7\n\n.\n\n. . . ..\n_TugComputer\n\n. ,arge\nWords\'\n\n200 1\n\n\nA S AS Range Control\nLOS Control\nManeuver\nCommandsiTarget Attitude Comp.\n\n100\n\nControl Loop\n& Control\n\n+Cor\n\nSLR\nElectronics\n\n300\n200\n\nSLR\n\n50\n\nClosure Initiation\nTotal\n\nL---L\n\nCorner\n\nReRR \n\n\nLOS\n\n750\n\n[Docking Port Coalignment 200\n1Translation\nSequencing\n\nDia.\n\nSmall Dia.\n\n.\n\n1\n1\n\n\n1500\n50\n\n\'Rendezvous\nInspection Orbit\n\nTug\n\n3350\n\nTOffset\nact"\n\na a\nProcessor 4 IMa\nr "D\n-,.-\n\n0\n\nI Data\n\nSignai\n\n-7 -\n\n\n/\'\n4/\nFloodlight\n\nL\n, ransponder \n\n\nTo Ground\nFigure\n\n111-6.

The\ncomplexity of performing this same function while the Tug is maneuvering around\nthe target is\n\nadded for the second inspection phase test.\n\nCheckpoints along the\n\nway reduce the nu her of variables and expedite the test flow. This allows veri\xc2\xad\nfication of the first capability before introducing another "building block" of\n\ncomplexity; thus proceeding stepeise through the scenario.\n\nThe test elements described in the following paragraph are subdivided into\nsupportive test rationale and facility selection for each defined test.\n\nA fur\xc2\xad\n\nther subdivision is made by manual, autonomous and hybrid candidate systems\ntests.\n1.\n\nManual System Tests - The test rationale for performing the recommended\n\nseries of tests for the manual system is summarized in Figure IV-3.\n\nThe desire\n\nwas to make use of one facility for a total test series, if possible, to reduce\ntest setup costs and provide an orderly progression of tests.\n\nAnother considera\xc2\xad\n\ntion is the fact that an end-to-end systems test covering all phases has been\nproven to be cost effective in the long run.\n\nThis approach has historically un\xc2\xad\n\ncovered problem areas which were not anticipated, and allowed testing of transition\n\nfrom phase-to-phase.\n\nThis approach produces a higher confidence in the results.\n\n\nThe facilities considered for each pease of the test program and the ad\xc2\xad\nvantages/disadvantages for each are illustrated in Figure IV-4.\n\nEach facility\n\n\nselection was made to maximize the use of existing MSFC facilities and minimize\n\nthe modification to these facilities.\n\nThe fidelity requirements dictated\n\n\naccurate dynamics and good representation of mission effects (celestial scenes\n\nand day/night simulations).\n\nRefer to test procedure RIM of Volume III of this\n\n\nreport for details.\n\nThese requirements are hest met by the T27 Space Flight Simulator (SFS)\n\nof the MSFC Rendezvous and Docking Laboratory.\n\n\nIV-5\n\n\nDOCKING\nSELECTIONMANUAL\nFACILITY\n\n- MANUALRENDEZVOUS\nSELECTION\nFACILITY\nAircraf Flight\n\nT27 ace FI ht Simulator\ng\n\nAdvvantages\nA\n* RedUced ltitude Effects\nAlles ActualRanges\n* Permits Full Scale\n\nS.\nAdontage\n* Easiy Prcduces Composite\nImage\n* Minimum Facilities Modse\n.Visual Sitaularis Available\nlCelestial(Lightingl\nCost\nO\n* Relui ea\n" Requires Mission Or t To\n\n* LewCost\no Full SizeTargetAl\nActuat Ranges\n\nTarget\nAPass\n.ebrac\n\nImag\ninan\n* Requires TwoAircraft\ne\xe2\x80\xa2 caoti~ong\nFacility\n*LHigh Coal\n\nShuac\n\nIncreasd Tove\n\nDiadantes\nRequires cl\nPiner SupplY\nNo xsigFclt cm upyDifficult\n* Requires Moblcale\nMini-computer\nAdded\nGroundI\notion\n\nNputralBuoyancy\n\nale Hardware\nF\nWide Range\nOfOffset\n(Initial\nAnalable\nConditions}\n.

The fidelity requirements dictated full\n\nscale target mookups due to sizing and placement of spacecraft mounted aids\n\n(e.g., retrorefleotors). Further, good dynamics representation is required from\n\nthe inspection range to final docking.\n\nSince scaling cannot be easily accommodated, the rendezvous phase tests\n\n-require approximately 25 miles separation between sensor and target, A Shuttle\n\nflight test and an aircraft flight were considered to reduce atmospheric effects.\n\nAm alternative approach which reduces atmospheric effects significantly, hut\n\nnot as much as the other options, is recommuended due to cost. This approach in\xc2\xad\nvolves mounting a target in the Rooky Mountains west of Denver, Colorado and\n\nproviding a vehicle mounted sensor.\n\nThe details of this test may be found in\n\n\nTest Procedure RIA, Volume III of this report.\n\nIV-8\n\nRIA - Acquisition, Tracking & Ranging\nAt Max Range\n\ntMa Rne\n* New Technology SensorslSoftware\n" Defines Range Specifications\n\n*\n\nI1hA Automatic Target Tracking\n1A-AtmIai agtTak~\n\nTests RIA Thru R3A\nInitial\nTerminal\nRendezvous Rendezvous\n\nUncertainty Of Target Distinguishment.\n\n*Reduceil Range Requires More Stringent Control\n\nDetermines UghtinglPointing Constraints\n\n* Definesi Range Specification For Sensor\n\n\nInspection\n\n\n.Vieing\n\n12A - AutomatedTarget Inspection\n\n\nFrom Background\n\n* Lighting Effects \t\n\n*Adds Cbomplexity Of Tracking While Maneuvering\npaRefines; Inspection Range Specification\nR Defines!

SRT activity includes long lead effort and activity that will keep design\n\noptions open until a sound technical basis fo\n\ndeletion can be developed.\n\nThe\n\n\nR/V&D integration activity is

to\n\n\nidentify potential for commonality among programs and provide for a greater flex\xc2\xad\nibility in design to accommodate the multiple purposes that will evolve from the\n\nbroader application of the system.\n\nAnother rather broad conclusion was reached with regard to the payload\n\nintegration task that will evolve as new space systems become operational, and\n\nthe number and variety of users grow in the years ahead.\n\nAny payload desiring\n\n\nmore than simple deployment will interface with STS through what could, and\n\nshould, be a common system; the Rendezvous and Docking System.\n\nThis interface\n\n\nrole leads to the conclusion that the R/V&D system should be a part of the total\n\nSTS payload integration effort, rather than constrained to a specific STS vehicle,\n\nsuch as the Space Tug.\n\nIt appears that a developmental/operational role for a\n\n\nrendezvous and docking integrator should be implemented.\n\n\n-\n\nV-2\n\nDockingsi\n\n0;\n\nFree

the\n\nspacecraft community are illustrated in Figure V-i.\n\nThese interfaces are closely\n\n\ninterrelated; payload integration and rendezvous and docking tasks are closely\n\nallied.\n\nMany of the tasks involved in payload integration are required to arrive\n\n\nat a rendezvous and docking system.\n\nCreation of a broad integration role en\xc2\xad\n\ncompassing both rendezvous and docking, and payload integration seems desirable\n\nfor the following reasons:\n\no \tThe major interface between STS elements and spacecraft is\n\nthrough the rendezvous and docking system.\n\no \tSTS and payload designers are preoccupied.with internal design\n\nproblems.\n\n\nV-3\n\n"AL\'4j\n\no \tAn integrator can act as an unbiased negotiator between STS and\n\nthe spacecraft community.\n\no, The integrators broad knowledge will provide an efficient transi\xc2\xad\ntion to the operational phase.\n\nShould this integration role be sanctioned, the tasks required to define and\n\nimplement the required development and operational activities are as follows:\n\n\n\'Programs \t\n\nI\n\n.Rendezvous\t\n& \tDocking_\nlnteatio\nPhase A/B \t\n\n_\n\n_\n\n__\n\nPhase C DDT&E\n\n__ _ __ _\nPhase D

to rendezvous and docking system development and operation\n\ni\nthat meets all STS objectives.\n\nThen the Phase B effort should be broadened to\n\n\nencompass the total payload integration effort, and scoped to permit specific\n\ndefinition of each identifiable application.\n\nv-4\n\nPhase C DDT&E activity must follow\n\n\na common thread developed in the Phase A/B activity, but must be pointed par\xc2\xad\nticularly to support specific operationa requirements.\n\nThose recognized at this\n\n\ntime are Shuttle rendezvous activity, IUS servicing missions, EOTS missions, and\n\nOTV missions (beginning with geostationary space station assembly).\n\nPhase D\n\n\nactivity is oriented at operational support,an area where payload integration\n\nand rendezvous and docking mission planning are key continuing roles.\n\nThe\n\n\napproximate schedule of these integration activities is shown in Figure V-3.\n\nTable V-2 outlines the first step in the implementation of the Rendezvous\n\nani docking System Integration role.\n\nAs noted, the objective is to bring the\n\n\nmany RIV&D requirements anticipated in the STS era into a common perspective.\n\nIt\n\n\nis necessary to understand all objectives, and to evolve a comprehensive approach\n\nthat will yield the most cost effective path to achieving all these objectives.\n\nThe study outlined will provide that common base that leads to efficient utiliza\xc2\xad\ntion of available funding.\n\nThe most important specific output of this study will\n\n\nbe system interface definitions that will assure future STS vehicles, spacecraft,\n\nand ground support facilities will be able to effectively meet anticipated opera\xc2\xad\ntional goals involving rendezvous and docking.\n\n-\n\nC.\n\nSIMULATION/DEMONSTRATION RECOMMENDATIONS\nA simulation/demonstration activity is considered to be a key element in\n\n\nthe development of remote rendezvous and docking capability for the STS era.\n\nThe development program defined during this study includes SRT activities and\n\nanalyses which should precede simulation/demonstration tests.\n\nThe tests are\n\n\nseparated into manual and autonomous systems procedural sets.\n\nIt is recommended\n\n\nthat these efforts be pursued concurrently and the hybrid system tests only be\n\ndeltas to address interactions and interfaces which result from bringing manual\n\nand autonomous elements together in a hybrid "best mix" system.\n\nA simulation/demonstration test program was specified which maximized\n\nusage of existing MSFC facilities,\n\nThe test program provides an end-to-end\n\n\nsystems test flow demonstrating all phases of a rendezvous and docking mission.\n\nTest Descriptions and Test Procedures were developed and are presented in Parts\n\nIII and IV, respectively, of Volume III of this report.\n\nA Facilities Modification\n\n\nV-5\n\n\n76 77 78 79 80 81 82\'83 84 85\nShuttle\nOTV\nD ta Assy\nS\nA\nSu tleS \n\nServicing\n\n..\nMissions\n\nPotential
