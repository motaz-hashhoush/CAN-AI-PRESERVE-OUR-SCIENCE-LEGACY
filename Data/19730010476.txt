GENERAL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\n1.\n\nSystem Concept\n\nUnder NASA Contract NAS8-27538 a prototype quad redundant data\nterminal and associated multiplexer/demultiplexer units (MDU\'s) have\nbeen designed and built. The quad redundancy allows the system to\nmeet a fail operational, fail operational, fail safe criteria. As\nshown in Figure\n1 , the data terminal interfaces with a redundant\nmain supervisory bus and a redundant main data bus. Up to 64 data\nterminals can be operated from these buses. Three redundant local\nbuses, for supervisory words, data in, and data out, are provided to\ninterface with the MDU\'s. Data from the MDU\'s is stored in memory\nin the data terminal until requested. Provision is made for transfer\nof data between data terminals. The system can operate at either a\n1 MHz or 500 kHz.bit rate. Words are 20 bits in length with each\ndata word containing two eight bit bytes. Each MDU has .32 analog\nand 32 bi-level (digital) inputs and the same number of outputs.\nThe system design has been .conceived to provide flexibility to adapt\nto changing data handling requirements, minimum software complexity,\nand minimum bus transfer rate for a given vehicle data flow requirement.\nThe following paragraphs provide a general description of both\nthe data terminal and MDU.\n\ni\na\n\n-&\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 ...\n\nHI\n\nM\n\n>*\n\n\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7\n\nu\n3\n\nu\nH\n\ng\nM\n\xc2\xa3\n\ni\n\n1\n\n(0\n\nI\ni\n\n\xc2\xa7\n.\n\nsi\n3 3\n3\n\n2.\n\nRedundant Data Terminal\n\nThe Data Terminal is an element of a data bus subsystem and serves as an\nentry and exit point to the data cable for messages whose destination\nor point of origin is one or more user subsystems located in a given\nlocalized area of a vehicle. The Data Terminal is quad redundant with\na fault tolerance criteria of fail operational/fail operational/failsafe.\nThe Data Terminal Functions are: a) detect the signalling waveforms\non the supervisory and data cables, b) perform waveform checks, parity\nchecks, and comparison checks on the detected inputs, c) decode supervisory\ncommands, d) produce the proper format and waveform for subsystem, f) buffer\ndata inputs from the user subsystem in a scratch pad (random access) memory\nto accommodate the timing requirements of data bus .transfer operations, g)\nproduce on the data cable the proper outputs at the times dictated by the\nsupervisory commands.\n.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 "\nThe Data Terminal receives supervisory information from a set. of\n4 supervisory cables all of which carry the same supervisory commands.\nHowever, the time relationship is altered; so that.the commands are delayed\nby 0,. 5, 10, or 15 bits. The Data Terminal realigns the commands\nand then compares them all in each of four separate channels. Each\nchannel has its own power supply and functions independently from the\nother three channels. All timing and synchronization signals are derived\nfrom the supervisory input which is a bi-phase level (Manchester) waveform.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n.\nEach channel checks its own supervisory input to ascertain that the\nincoming signal has the correct waveform at the correct frequency. If\nan error is detected a waveform error signal is issued. Next, each command\nis checked for correct parity. A clock and sync signal are also generated\nin each channel. Each channel uses the clock generated by its own supervisory input unless a waveform error is detected in which case it\nselects a clock from one .of the other channels. This clock is put into\na Johnson counter to generate the timing signals required by the channel.\nThe supervisory command, error signals, and sync signal are aligned\nfor all four channels through the use of delay registers. Then each\nchannel assembles its own version of the supervisory command on a bit\n;\nby bit basis.\n\nTo do this, each channel compares its own bits,against those received\nby the other channels. If a waveform error is detected in a..channel, ,\nthe bit from that channel is not used in the comparison. The bit which\nis in the majority is entered into a storage register. In the case of\na tie vote, the channel uses its own bit.\nThe parity bit is received at the end of the supervisory word when\nthe storage register is fully loaded. At this time, each channel\nselects the word in its own register unless a waveform or parity error\nhas been detected in that channel; in which case it selects the word\nfrom one of the other channels where no errors have been detected. The\nword finally selected by each channel is referred to as the authentic\nsupervisory word. If errors are detected on all four channels, that\nparticular supervisory word is rejected and not acted upon.\nThe Data Terminal also receives and transmits information on a set\nof 4 main data bus cables each of which is associated with one channel\nof the Data Terminal. (The time relationship between these cables is\naltered the same as for the supervisory cables.) .The incoming data words\nare checked and compared and an authentic, data word is selected exactly\nas with the supervisory word. The authentic data word is then either\nstored in the memory or transmitted to the user subsystem. .\nOutgoing words on the main data cables are handled somewhat\ndifferently from the incoming data words. These words are taken from\nthe buffer memory and are available in parallel with a known parity.\nThus, a parity check can be performed immediately; and channels with words\nwhose parity is incorrect can select the word from another channel.\nThese words are now compared on a bit by bit basis as the word is;being\nshifted out of the Data Terminal. Here again, each channel selects\nthe bit which is in the majority. However, in the case of a tie vote\na signal is generated which causes the word to be transmitted with\neven parity (odd parity is correct). In this way, the receiving\nsystem will be warned that the data is bad and will reject it.\nIn this design, it is assumed that the local user systems with which\nthe Data Terminal will interface are redundant. Therefore, each channel\nof the Papa Terminal has its own local output data bus, local input\ndata bus, and local supervisory bus; The information transmitted to\nthe user system is not compared. This should be done at the user system\nto detect any errors, such as noise, which may occur during transmission.\nFor most types of failures, this design should continue to function\nproperly despite three failures. Only if a failure occurred at the \'same\npoint in three of the four channels. would three failures.result in\nerroneous operation; and this is an extremely low probability type of\noccurance.\n\n3.\n\nMultiplexer/Demultiplexer\n\nThe multiplexer/demultiplexer (MDU) interfaces with the data terminal\nand the various subsystems. The MDU can receive information from and transfer information to the subsystems. Twenty bit polar RZ supervisory and data\nwords are transmitted from the data terminal to the MDU. Bit twenty is\nactually a missing bit to provide word synchronization.\nThe MDU can be\noperated in two Modes (A & B) both of which are time synchronous with the\ndata terminal because the clock is derived from the supervisory word. In\nMode A the MDU is completely controlled by the data terminal. A supervisory\nword enables the multiplexer to accept subsystem data or the demultiplexer\nis enabled to provide data to the subsystem. In Mode B the demultiplexer\nis enabled by the supervisory word but the multiplexer is wired to an internal address generator which continuously sequences through all of the\nmultiplexer addresses. The internally generated addresses are sent to the\ndata terminal on the data line, with each address followed by the related\ndata. Consequently the data in the data terminal is continuously updated.\nThe MDU has 32 analog and 32 binary data channels in both the multiplexer/demultiplexer portions. Analog data levels are 0 to +5 volts and\nbinary.data.levels are TTL compatible..\nAll multiplexer analog addresses either from a supervisory word or\nfrom the .internal address generator enable two analog channels to 8 bit\ndigital form during the first half of the word time following receipt of\nthe address. The data from the second channel is similarly processed\nduring the second half of the word. Both 8-bit words, are loaded into\na data output register for transmission back to the data terminal during\nthe next word time after processing. Thus 16 bits of data are transmitted.\nAs long as a Mode A MDU is addressed, there will be a continuous stream of\ndata returned to the data terminal. However, Mode B MDUs will always\nreturn information continuously}but as indicated previously every other word\nwill be the address of the succeeding data. Bit seventeen is an odd parity\nbit which defines the parity of the sixteen bits. Bits eighteen and nineteen\n;\nare zeros.\n\'\nTwo multiplexer binary addresses each enable sixteen binary channels.\nControl logic enables ampling of these channels two at ,a time in four sequential time periods during the word time following the address. As\nin the case of the analog data. The data is transmitted to the data terminal\nduring the next word time. Parity bit 17 and zero bits 18 and 19> are again\nadded to the data stream.\n\nSimilarly the analog and the binary demultiplexer addresses enable\nthe acceptance of data. Each analog data address enables two channels\nand a binary address enables sixteen channels. There is only one mode\nof operation for the demultiplexer and all addressing is done by\na supervisory word from the data terminal. When a supervisory word\nconveying a demultiplexer address is transmited the related data will be\ntransmitted during the third word time after completion of the address.\nTherefore, the demultiplexer contains a buffer storage register in\nthe address receiver so that address decoding occurs during the data\nreceipt time.\nAll demultiplexer data is received in digital form. The data\nword format is basically the same as a supervisory word, that is, 20\nbits long with the twentieth bit missing for sync. Because of other\nsystem requirements bits 1, 18, and 19 are not used. Bits 2 through\n17 are data.\nIf the data is related to an analog address the sixteen bits represent two 8 bit digital equivalents of the two desired analog outputs.\nThese digital words are loaded into 8-bit storage registers which interface with two D/A converters. The resulting 0 to 5 volt analog voltages\nare supplied to the user through linear buffer amplifiers.\nIf the data is related to binary outputs, bits 2 through 17 are\nparallel loaded into output storage registers where each output\nline of the register acts as a TTL compatible binary source for each of the\n16 users.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORY OF OPERATION OF DATA TERMINAL\n\n1.\n\nGeneral Explanation\n\nThe Data Terminal contains four redundant channels. The logic circuitry\nfor each channel is contained on three Cambion boards making a total of\ntwelve boards per Data Terminal. Two of the three boards have 126 sixteen\npin sockets for dual in line packages. The third board is a universal\nboard on which larger size sockets can be mounted. This board is used to\nmount the 24 pin memory packages and some large size component boards as\nwell as a variety of 14 and 16 pin packages. The schematics for these\nboards are designated 380-111, 112, and 113 with 380-112 being the universal\nboard. A block diagram of one channel of the Data Terminal is shown on\nschematic 380-110. Dotted lines indicate how the various blocks have been\nallocated to each board. The partitioning was based on minimizing interconnections between boards. In general, each block in the diagram represents one sheets of the schematic.\n\n2.\na.\n\nBoard No. 380-111 Supervisory Word Logic\n\nSheet 2 - Adjustable Delay\n\nThis sheet contains the adjustable delay circuit which is used\nto compensate for the different distances from each Data Terminal\nto the Bus Controller. Single shots G18 and G17 are set for identical\npulse lengths and are used to delay the leading and trailing edges\nof the supervisory word signal (SW) coming into the board from the\nline receiver. For demonstration purposes a 0.3 -ysec. delay has\nbeen chosen. A leading (positive going) edge triggers G18. When\nG18 times out, flip-flop, E15, is set. E15 .remains, set until a trailing\n(negative going) edge triggers G17. When G17 times out, it triggers\nF16, which produces a 0.2 microsecond pulse to reset E15. .Thus, the\noutput of E15 reproduces the input signal delayed by the time for\nwhich G17 and G18 are set.\n\nb.\n\nSheet 3 - Waveform Detector 1.\n\n.:\n\nThis sheet contains circuitry which generates a .sync pulse, clock\npulses and data bits from the supervisory word line pulses. Checks\nare made to ensure that the incoming signal has a transition in the\nmiddle of each bit time and that parity is correct. The times for the\nsingle shots used on this sheet have been chosen for a 1MHz input\nbit rate and would need to be changed for 500KHz^operation.\nFigure\n1 shows the timing for most of the significant signals\ngenerated in the waveform detector. At the top.a typical signal to\nthe positive supervisory word input is shown. This signal is differentiated\nby an input gating arrangement to produce the X pulses shown in the\nfigure. These pulses are between 50 and 100 nanoseconds duration.\nAs shown in the figure an X pulse occurs at least every 2 microseconds\nexcept for the period at the end of a word (bits 17-20) when there is\na 3.5 microsecond gap. Consequently, F15 is constantly being retriggered\nand does not time out until the last half of bit; 19, at which time\ni\nflip-flop, E15, is set. The Q output from E15 enables F12. On the :\nnext X puj.se, which occurs in the middle of bit 20, F12 triggers and\nputs out a sync pulse, which clear E15 and triggers G15 and G16.\nThe output from G15 is the clock pulse. When G16 triggers, its output\nis used to inhibit further inputs to G15 and G16 until G16 times out.\nIn this way, X and Y signals which occur at the beginning of a bit\n. .\ntime are filtered out and only transitions in the middle of a bit time\nwill generate clock pulses. Only bits 17 and 19 do not have transitions\n\nIn the middle of a bit time. To generate clock pulses for these\nbits, D15 is used to provide a 0.27 microsecond delay after G16 times\nout; When D15 times out, D16 triggers and provides a pulse, which\nwill cause a clock pulse to be generated, provided that the Tl-T 16 signal\nis not present and that an X or Y pulse has not appeared.\nflip-flop, E9, counts the number of zeros in a supervisory word\nduring the period T1-T16. An even count at the end of this period\nindicates a parity error and places a high signal on the SP line.\nG14 is retriggered every time a clock pulse occurs. If it should\never time out, it would indicate that something was wrong with the\nwaveform on the supervisory word line or that a failure had occurred in\nthe input circuitry. G13 is also triggered by the clock pulses. When\nit times out, G12 Is triggered. If the clock pulse is still present\nwhen the pulse from G12 appears, it is an indication that the clock\npulses are appearing too frequently or are of too long a.duration.\nIf either of these error indications occurs, flip-flop, E9, is set\nand a "hard" error indication signal, SH, is generated.\n\nc.\n\nSheet 4 - Clock Selector and Delay Register\n\n.\n\nThe clock selector circuit is shown at the top of Sheet 4.\nThe 93L18, C3, is a priority encoder whose output is an address\ncorresponding to the highest order input. The inputs are the hard\nerror indication from the four redundant channels. The signal SHW\nis the hard error indication for this particular channel and is low\nIn the absence of a hard error. Since, this signal is connected to\nthe highest order input of C3(7), address seven would normally\nappear at the output pins. (Because the address selects only one of\nfour clocks, only the two least significant bits of the address are\nactually used.) A hard error in this particular channel would cause\nSHW to go high and C3 would then put out the address of the next\nhighest order input that remained low. C2 is a four input multiplexer\nthat selects one of four inputs in accordance with address bits S\nand S.. .\nThe delay register is used to realign the entering data. Thus,\ndifferent delays must be used for each of the four channels. The\ndata, sync, and hard error indications are delayed in shift registers.\nThe parity indication, which is only used on a word basis, requires\nonly one flip-flop, which provides a one word time delay. The 74L99\ncircuits are four stage shift registers. The data and sync information\nare delayed by 15 bits for channel A, 10 bits for channel B, and 5 bits for\nchannel C. Because the hard error indication is generated in the bit time\nsucceeding the one in which the error occurred, it is delayed by one bit lesr>\nper channel. The signals for channel D are not delayed at all.\n\n10\n\nd.\n\nSheet 5 - Sync Selector\n\nThe two flip-flops designated D14 are used to check for the sync pulse\ncoming at the correct time. The top flip-flop is cleared at T19 and generates\nan error signal until the advanced sync pulse is detected. The bottom flip-flop\nis cleared during the first half of the Tl bit time^ If an advanced sync pulse\noccurs any time from Tl through T19, the bottom flip-flop is set, generating\nan error signal. An error signal causes the next sync, in order of priority,\nto be selected by the 93L18 priority encoder and 93L09 four input multiplexer.\ne.\n\nSheet 6 - Supervisory Word Channel Selector\ns\n\nThe 93L21 circuits, which are one of four decoders, on this sheet\nare actually part of the bit selection circuitry shown on Sheet 7.\nThe state of the hard error signals from the four channels are decoded\nto energize one of 16 output lines. Only seven of these lines are\nactually used.for bit selection. The states are given in Table 1.\nThe manner in which these signals are used and the bit selection\nprocess are discussed under the description for Sheet 7.\nOnce the parity bit has been received, additional information\nis available to select a complete word. This is done using the priority\nencoder D9. Each channel will use the word in its own supervisory\nregister (Sheet 7) provided that a hard error or a parity error/for\nthat particular channel does not exist. A check is made to see if\nall channels have errors. If this is the case a signal is fed to the\nall faults logic (Sheet 5 on Board 380-113) causing the supervisory\nword just received to be rejected.\n\nf.\n\nSheet 7 - Supervisory Word Bit Selector\n\n.\n\nEach channel forms a new supervisory word by selecting bits on\nthe basis of the error indication? that are available. If three of\n.\nthe four channels have hard errors, as indicated by H7, Hll, H13, or\nH14, the bit from the remaining channel is selected. If such a situation does not exist, the entering bits from all four channels are\ncompared using the five 93L21 blocks shown (Each 93L21 is a one of\nfour decoder. Together, they make up a one of 16 decoder.) The.various\ncomparison states are given in Table 2. Where one channel disagrees\nwith the other three, that channel is presumed to be in error (i.e.,\nstates C7 and C8). When a two vs two comparison exists and the bus\nagreeing with bus W has a hard error, but the other two busses do not\nhave hard errors, then bus W is presumed to be in error. These error\n\n11\n\nTABLE 1\nHARD ERROR DECODING\n\nSTATE\nIDENTIFICATION\n\nOUTPUT\n\nPOINT\n\nHW\n\nHX\n\nDETECTOR STATE\nHZ\nHY\n\nHo\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNot Used\n\nHI\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nGil -11\n\nH2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\nGll-10\n\nH3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nNot Used .\n\nH4;\n\no\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nG10-4\n\nH5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nNot Used\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\nNot Used\n\nH7\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nG10-7\n\nH8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNot Used\n\nH9\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\nNot Used\n\nH10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNot Used\n\nHll\n\n- 1\n\n1\n\nG10-9\n\nH12\n\n1\n\n0\n\nNot Used\n\nH13\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nG9-5\n\nH14\n\n1\n\nG9-6\n\n.1\n\n1\n1\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H15\n\nd\ni\ni\ni\ni\n\n1\n1\no\n\n1\n\nNot Used\n\nH6\n\n;\n\nHARD ERROR\n\n.\n\n;\n\n12\n\nTABLE 2\nDATA.

This bit is shifted into a 16 stage register A9 and A10 at the\nmiddle of a bit time. This allows one-half of a bit time for propagation\ndela_s through the bit selection logic. The output of flip-flop, BIO,\nwhich is set from Tl through T16, is used to gate the shift clock pulses\nto the register. Since no shift pulses occur from T17 through T20 the output of the register remains constant during this time period.\ng.\n\nSheet 8 - Supervisory Word Multiplexer\n\n.\n\nUsing the address bits generated on Sheet 6, the multiplexers on this\nsheet select the output from one of the four supervisory word registers,\nSheet 7. This word is then available, in parallel, for use in the channel\ncontrol logic.\nh.\n\nSheet 9 - Address Comparator\n\nThe requirement exists that a data terminal must receive certain\n.\nselected words transmitted by other data terminals. This means that the\ndata terminal addresses and data word addresses must be stored for\ncomparison purposes. This is done using programmable read only diode\nmatrices. Six bits comprise a data terminal address, and up to seven\nbits may be used for a data address within the data terminal. These\nthirteen bits are entered into a 26 x 10 diode array. Since both the\ntrue and false states of the address bits must be used to detect a comparison,\n26 inputs are used. Ten possible comparisons may be programmed. The RM-184\nis an 8 x 5 array and the RM-177 is a 5 x 5-array. When a comparison\nis detected, one of the ten output lines from the diode array is\nenergized. These output signals are then inverted through the RD-1534\ncircuits.\n\n14\n\ni... Sheet 10 - Address Generator\nWhen an address comparison is indicated by one of the input lines,\nW1-W10, going low/ a stored address is read from the 10 x 7 programmable\ndiode array implemented with the RM-113 circuits. At the same time a\ncomparison signal is generated. Interface inverters are used to provide\na TTL drive capability for the seven output address lines.\nj.\n\nSheet 11 - M/DU Supervisory Word Generator\n\nThe data terminal transmits commands to the M/DU over the local supervisory bus instructing the M/DU to transmit or receive data or to receive\na command. The address bits for the local supervisory word may come either\ndirectly from the main supervisory word or from the programmable diode\narray on Sheet 10. Selection is accomplished using quad 2 input multiplexer\ncircuits, G4 and G5, which provide parallel inputs to the local supervisory\nword register, Fl, G3, and F2. A zero is always loaded into the output\nstage of the register, Fl-4. Shift pulses are provided to the register\nonly during the T9-T19 time period. This insures that bits 1-9 of the local\nsupervisory word, which are not used, are always zero. Flip-flop, BIO,\nprovides a signal which disables the output clock during the T20 period.\nk.\n\nSheet 12 - Programming Boards\n\n.,\n\nThe component socket adapters, B2 and B3, contain only wires. They\nare used to provide a Data Terminal address (000001 in this instance),\na means of changing the mode of operation (A or B), and two local supervisory word bits (LSW10 and LSW11) which -are used to provide bits required\nby the M/DU, but which are not included in the main supervisory work.\nThe DT SELECT signal is generated at T19 bit time if the main supervisory\nword contains the correct address. Grounding the Mode Control line will\ncause the Data Terminal to operate in Mode A, while connecting it to +5V\nwill provide Mode B operation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2:\n\n15\n\n3.\na.\n\nBoard No. 380-112 Input Data Word and Memory Logic\n\nSheet 2 - Waveform Detector 2\n\nThis detector reconstructs the data and checks the parity and the\nform of the incoming waveform. An input on line DR1 corresponds to a\npositive pulse on the Main Data Bus; an input on line DR2 corresponds to\na negative pulse. Flip-flops (28, 64/1) and (28, 64/2) check the width of\nthe incoming pulses and put out a hard error signal (DH) if the input\ndoes not last at least 0.8/ysec. One additional hard error check is performed by flip-flops (30, 48/1) and (30, 48/2). These flip-flops produce\na hard error signal if the inputs DRl and DR2 do not alternate, corresponding to the laternating polarity of the Bi-Polar NRZ waveform.\nThe Input pulses are smoothed out to a consistent 0.8^ sec by one\nshots (22, 72) and (20, 72). These signals are then ORed together to\nproduce the Main Bus Data, MBD. Finally, the parity of the MBD is determined by flip-flop (20, 64/1) and a data parity error signal (DP) is\nproduced if the parity is even.\nb.\n\nSheet 3 - Data Clock Selector\n\nThe pulses on the main data bus input may be delayed up to 750 nanoseconds with respect to the supervisory word clock. This delay overlaps\nthe clock pulse transition time making it possible, for clock transition\nand data transitions to occur so close together that the operation of\nflip-flops and registers cannot be guaranteed. To circumvent this problem,\nthe circuitry on this sheet selects the clock phase (CL or CL) whose\nleading edge occurs after the start of the da-ta pulse but before its\nconclusion.\nTo accomplish this, the leading edge of the first bit of a data word\n(which is always a one) is used to set flip-flop (20, 64).\nThe next leading\nedge of a clock phase will cause either flip-flop (20, 55/1) or (20, 56/2)\nto be set. This selects that particular clock phase and resets flip-flop\n(06)\n2 / 4 . The clock phase remains selected for the duration of the data\nword. The selection flip-flops are reset at the 20th bit time of the corresponding supervisory word.\nc.\n\nSheet 4 - Data Delay Register\n\nThe selected clock is used to clock data into a flip-flop (30, 40/1)\nfrom which it is clocked into the delay register using \'CER. The data\nhard error signal (DH2) is also delayed in a register. The parity error :\nindication is stored in a flip-flop.\n>\n.\n\n16.\n\nd.\n\nSheet 5 - Data Channel Selector\n\nThe data channel selector is identical to the supervisory channel\nselector described for Board No. ^380-111.\ne. Sheet 6 - Data Bit .Selector\nThe data bit selector is identical to the supervisory bit selector\ndescribed for Board No. 380-111.\n.\nf. .Sheet 7 & 8 - Data Selector\n. , .The data selector is identical to the supervisory word selector\ndescribed for Board No. 380-111. Sheet 8 contains the circuitry for selecting\nthe seventeenth bit (excluding the initial one) of the word.\ng.\n\nSheet 9 - Local Output Register\n\nThe local output register is an eighteen stage register which is\nloaded with a data word from the main data bus. The first bit of the\nword is always a one, so the output stage is preset to a one when the\nregister is loaded. Register shift pulses are inhibited during T19 and T20\nwhen the register is being loaded. The XFER to M/DU signal cuts off during\nthe last half of T19 so no LOB clock pulse is generated during T20.\nh. ,Sheet 10 - Memory Input Data Selector\n\n:\n\nData from the local input bus (LDI) is shifted into a 17 stage\nregister. Either the outputs from this register or the data from the main\ndata bus can be selected by the 93L22 multiplexers. Normally, the local\ndata is selected unless the Receive From Main Data Bus and T20 signals are\npresent.\ni.\n\nSheet 11 - 64 x 17 RAM\n\nEach MK4002P contains storage for 64 four bit words. Five of these\ncircuits are used to provide a total word length of 20 bits, of which only\n17 bits are used. Reading or writing occurs when the Read Enable or\nWrite Enable line is pulsed.\n.\n\n17\n\n4.\na.\n\nBoard No. 380-113 Control and Output Data Logic\n\nSheet 2 - Bit Timer\n\n.\n\nThe bit timer supplies all timing signals used by a channel of\nthe data terminal. It consists of a ten stage shift register with\ninverted feedback which is cleared by the aligned sync pulse from the\nsupervisory bus. During the ten clock pulses after the sync, ones are\nshifted into the register until it is completely loaded with ones.\nThe, during the next ten ones, zeros are shifted in until the register\nis completely cleared. The sync occurs during the 20th bit when the\nregister would normally be cleared anyway. With this arrangement all\ntiming signals can be generated using two input gates with inverters\nwhere required.\n.\nb.\n\nSheet 3 - Control Logic 1\n\nThe control logic generates the command signals used to control\nthe logic in a channel of the data terminal. It also provides delay\nshift registers for storing the information until it is required. Information is set into the first stages of the delay registers at T19\ntime. It is then shifted by each T18 pulse.\nA preset signal is generated at Bll-4 whenever a type B or C\nsupervisory word is received addressed to that particular data terminal\n(i.e., whenever the data terminal is to transmit or receive data). If\na comparison signal is generated (See board 380-111 sheet 10) and if\nthe transmit (S7) and destination (S8) bits are true, a preset signal\nis generated at Cll-4. A preset signal is generated at C14-4 whenever\nthe transmit (S7) bit is true. A preset signal is generated at D12-4.\nwhenever the destination (S8) bit is true. The information in the\nregisters is decoded to obtain channel control signals. Figure 2 shows\nthe timing for these signals.\nc.\n\nSheet 4 - Control Logic 2\n\nThis sheet contains the logic which controls the storage and\nselection of status data, the reading of the memory, and the loading\nand shifting of output data.\n\n18\n\nTo read out status data, a supervisory command word (Type .A\nsupervisory word) is sent to the data terminal. The command bits\nare S10 through S15. Command No. 1 ( 0 0 1 is used to request a\n000)\nstatus readout. When this command is received, a preset signal is\ngenerated at C7-4. Then, two word times later, a status data select\nsignal is generated which .causes the data terminal to feed status\ndata instead of memory data .into the output register.\nThe read address select signal is used to select the proper\naddress when reading the memory. The Bit 1 signal ensures that the\nfirst bit of each output data word is a 1. The local clock signal\ngates either status data or memory data into the output data register,\nThis register is then shifted by the data register shift signal.\nThe data shift enable signal enables the output-delay register which\nprovides the proper skew between output data words. The read enable\nsignal is the signal that actually causes the memory to read.\nd.\n\nSheet 5. - All Faults Logic\n\nWhen all four channels in the Data Terminal indicate faults, it\nis imperative that action be taken to prevent improper data being used\nin the user system. If errors are detected in all four output data\nwords, even parity is transmitted to indicate an erroneous word. If\nall four input data words are in error, the word is rejected and no\ndata is transmitted to the M/DU. If all four supervisory, words are\nin error, the supervisory word is not used (decoding is inhibited).\nThe information that all words had simultaneous errors is also\nstored in flip-flops until a command is received to read out a status\nword. The all error indications are then read out as status bits 13,\n14, and 15.\n\ne.\n\nSheet 6 - Status Register\n\nWhen a status word is commanded, the error signals for operations,\nimmediately proceeding transmission of the status word are stored to\nmake up the bits for the status word. Four bits are used for output\ndata word error indications; four bits are used for input data word\nerror indications; four bits are used for supervisory word error\n\n19\n\nindications; and three bits are used for the all error indications.\nThe sixteenth bit (SI17) is not used and a parity indication is generated by the 74L86 exclusive or gates for the seventeenth bit (SI18).\nf.\n\nSheet 7 - Data Register and Parity Checker\n\nThe quad 2-input multiplexers, 93L22s, normally select the memory\noutput data unless the status data select signal is present. The\nselected data is entered into a seventeen stage register (G8, G7, G6,\nG5 and G2) when the load clock pulse occurs. It is then shifted out by\nthe data register shift signal during the T7-T4 time interval. The\nbit 1 signal is entered at T6 time to make the first bit of the word\na one. Parity is checked by the exclusive or gates. If parity is correct\nflip-flop,\' D3, is set and PW, the parity error indication, will be\nlow.\ng.\n\nSheet 8 - Authentic Data Selector\n\nWhen wrong parity is indicated for an output data word, the next\nhighest order word without a parity error is selected by the priority\nencoder, 93L18. The priorities differ from channel to channel as\nspecified in Table 3. This is done to ensure that in the cases of two\nchannels with parity errors, the same data will not be used as a substitute for both.\n\nDesignation\n\nA\n\nw\n\nA\n\nX\n\nChannel No.\nB\nC\n=\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nD\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nC\n\nD\n\nA\n\nB\n\nY\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nA\n\nZ\n\nD\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nTABLE 3\nCHANNEL BIT SELECTION PRIORITIES\nThe selected word, W1, is now compared bit by bit with the selected\nwords from the other three channels, where W compares with at least two.\nof the other three bits, it is transmitted. If W does not compare with\nany of the other three bits, then X\' is transmitted in its place. If W\ncompares with only one other bit, then a conclusive selection is not possible\nand even parity is transmitted to indicate the word may contain a possible\nerror.\n\n20\n\nh.\n\nSheet 9 - Output Delay Register\n\nBecause of differences in design, the output delay registers for all\nfour channels are shown on this sheet. These registers provide the skew\nrequired between output words. The 74L91 is an eight stage shift register,\nwhile the 74L99 is a four stage shift register. Channel D is delayed\nby 15 bits; channel C is delayed by 10 bits; channel B is delayed by 5\nbits; and channel A is not delayed.\n\ni. Sheet 10 - Main Data Bus Waveform Generator\nThe logic on this sheet converts the data and clock signals to the\nsignal required by the line drivers for the main Data Bus. On the Main .\nData Bus, ones are indicated by alternating polarity and zeros by a zero\nlevel. The waveform generator causes the first one in a word to appear on\nthe DCB line, and the next one to appear on the DAB line, etc. For.a zero\nboth DCB and DAB :are high.\n. . . . . - \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 , \'\xe2\x80\xa2...\n\nj.\n\nSheet 11 - Local Data Input Logic\n\nThis sheet contains the logic which gates the first 17 bits of a\ndata word into the memory input register. It also contains logic for sync\ndetection, address recognition, and write control during Mode B operation.\nFlip-flop, A5/1, is set by the supervisory word sync pulse. This\nallows data clock pulses to be gated into the four bit counter, A4. At\nthe end of the sixteenth clock pulse A5/1 is cleared; and at the end of\nthe seventeenth clock pulse, the input to A4 is inhibited. Thus, exactly\n17 clock pulses are allowed through on the LDC line.\nIn Mode B operation, the M/DU sends first an address word and then\na data word on the local data input line. The 20th pulse of each word\nis deleted for sync purposes. Single shot, B4, is continuously retriggered\nuntil the missing sync pulse allows it to time out. Single shot, B7, ,\nis then initiated, clearing fliprflop, A2/1,\' on its leading edge. This\ncauses the succeeding data word to be gated into a nine state register\nconsisting of Al and A5/2. On the next sync pulse, if the last two bits,\nOA and OB, in the register are ones, flip-flop A2/1 is set. This provides\nan output from B2-6 which enables the next 17 clock pulses on the LDC :\n\n21\n\nline. These pulses clock the next 17 bits into the memory input register.\nOn the next T18 pulse, a IA XFER signal is generated which transfers the\nlocal address bits into the memory address register. A WRITE B signal\nis also generated at this time to write the data into the memory.\nk.\n\nSheet 12 - Memory Address Register\n\nThe memory address register actually consists of four separate registers each of which hold the address for one word time. A7 and A6 are loaded\nwith an address fro;.; the incoming supervisory word at the middle of T19,\nThis address is then parallel transferred down through the other registers\nat the middle of each succeeding T19 bit time. C2 and Cl are four bit\ndata selectors/storage registers which select either the address from the\nsupervisory word or the local address for writing data.\nE2 and El are quad 2 input multiplexers which select either a read\naddress or a write address as desired.\n\n22\n\n5.\n\nLine Drivers and Receivers\n\n. The line drivers and receivers for the Data Terminal are shown on \xe2\x80\xa2\nschematic 380-114. There are a total of six circuits of three different\ntypes: the Local Data Bus Receiver, the Main Data Bus Receiver, and the\nMain Supervisory Bus Receiver are the same; the Local Data Bus Transmitter\nand the Local Supervisory Bus Transmitter are the same; the Main Data .\nBus Transmitter is different from the other two transmitters because of\nisolation requirements. Each redundant channel has an identical set of\nsix circuits. All 24 circuits are packaged on three PC boards which\nare identical. These boards are designated -009, -019 and -029. Two\nsets of component designations and pin numbers appear on each sheet of\nthe schematic.

The demultiplexer is a new circuit design. Although the functions\nof the multiplexer and demultiplexer are generally independent, the address\nreceiving and some control logic are common.\nb. ; Multiplexer\n\n-\n\nThe basic operation of the multiplexer is to receive a supervisory word\nfrom the data terminal, decode an address from the supervisory word and in\nresponse to a correct address, sample data. Sampled analog data is converted to digital form and is returned to the data terminal serially. Sampled\nbinary data is also returned to the data terminal in digital form. The\nmultiplexer is capable of interrogating 32 analog channels and 32 binary\nchannels. Two analog channels are sampled for each related address and 16:\nbinary channels are sampled per assigned address. Both supervisory and data\nwords are twenty bits long. Analog data words consist of two 8-bit data\nsamples, a parity bit, two zero\'s and a missing pulse for sync. Binary data\nwords contain 16 binary bits, a parity bit, two zero\'s and missing pulse for\nsync.\nThe multiplexer is designed to run in two modes if wiring changes are\nmade. When a multiplexer is connected in the most common mode, designated\nA, data is only sampled and updated upon command from the data terminal.\nReiterating, analog data is sampled and converted to digital form upon decoding of a valid address. The data processing occurs during the word time\nafter the correct address. The data is transmitted to the data terminal two\nword time after the address. In the other mode, designated B, the multiplexer is used as a dedicated unit and data to the data terminal is updated\ncontinuously.\nIn the mode B operation the multiplexer is wired to operate,\nfrom an internal format generator. This generator continuously cycles through\nall of the valid addresses. The internally generated addresses are sent\nback to the data terminal serially on the data line. Each address is followed\nby its related data. In mode B all addresses are still encoded in a 20 bit\nword, but only bits 12 through 20 are necessary for identifying the addresses.\nBits 12 through 17 are specific addresses; bits 18 and 19 are ones and- b$.t\ntwenty is missing for sync. The data format is the same as thaf described\n. for mode A.\n\n25\n\nc.\n\nDemultiplexer\n\n, The operation of the demultiplexer is to receive data upon command\nfrom the data terminal and transmit it to the user. All received data is\nin serial digital form. Analog originated data is reconverted to analog\nform for the user and binary data is separated into the necessary discrete\noutputs. Thirty-two analog channels and 32 discrete channels are demultiplexed. Similar to the multiplexer, the demultiplexer decodes correct\naddresses and receives corresponding data. Timing is such that data is\nnot received until the start of the third word after the address. Data\nto the user is updated at the end of the third word after the related\naddress. Like the multiplexer each address corresponds to two analog\nwords or to 1.6 binary bits of data.\nd.\n\nCommon Circuits\n\nAs can be seen from the block diagram there are some circuits common\nto both the multiplexer and demultiplexer sections of the MDU. Only one\naddress receiver is necessary for receiving all addresses from the data\nterminal for multiplexing and demultiplexing and the basic control logic\nof the multiplexer is usable for the demultiplexer control. Detailed\ndescriptions of these common circuits and all the rest of the circuits\nare presented in the discussion to follow:\n\n26\n\n2.\n\na.\n\nAddress Processing\n\nWaveform\n\nThe address receiver receives twenty bit supervisory words from the\ndata terminal. The waveform is a bipolar RZ with positive going infor- .\nmation representing a digital one and negative going information is a\ndigital zero. Zero level is quiescent. Drawing 380-52 shows this waveform. The voltage levels of the waveform are +4 + 10%, -4 + 10%, and 0.\nA supervisory word contains 19 information bits and a missing twentieth\npulse for sync. The nineteenth bit is the least significant bit. Bits\n9 through 18 and sync are the bits used to address the MDU.\nb.\n\nReceiver Circuits\n\nDrawing 380-23, sheet 1, contains the schematic diagram of the address\nreceiver. The input amplifier, HA2515 and associated components, comprise\na unity gain high input impedance buffer amplifier .for loading of the\naddress line. The amplifier is operated from plus and minus 12 volts which\nare provided by an isolated winding in the power transformer so that the\nMDU system ground is isolated from the data terminal ground. Since a dcisolated coupling is required between the two systems, two MCD-2 light\ncouplers interface the output of the amplifier with LM-306 comparators in.\nthe MDU system. Diode CR5 couples positive going pulses (ones) into one\nlight coupler and diode CR6 couples negative going pulse (zeros) into the\nother coupler. One LM306 converts the output of the "ones" coupler to TTL\ncompatible one information pulses and,the other LM306 converts the "zeros"\ncoupler to zero information pulses. OR combining of one and zero pulses\nprovides a system clock (All, A3 of 380-23, sheet 2.) Although the light,\ncouplers are fast their inherent circuit capacities degrade rise and fall\ntimes of output pulses unless considerable input drive power is used. Transformers Tl and T2 are peaking transformers used to maintain good switching\ntimes without excessive power.\nc.\n\nSync Generators\n\nThe schematic diagram of the sync generators is shown on drawing 380-23,\nsheet 2, Three type 74L122 low power retriggerable one shots (A5, A6, A7)\nare used for sync generation. The clock derived from the supervisory word\nis used to trigger A5. The time constant of A5 is set slightly longer than\none clock period; therefore, A5 will never time out as long as there are\nclock pulses. When no clock pulse occurs during the twentieth bit time A5\nwill time out and changes states, which will trigger A6 to generate a 300\nnanosecond sync pulse. Since there is some need for a delayed sync pulse\nthe output of A6 is used to trigger A7 which generates another 300 nanosecond\npulse immediately following the first sync pulse.\n\n27\n\nd. Multiplexer Address Decoding In Mode A\nThe output of the address "1" comparator is fed into a ten bit serial\nshift register (Fl thru F10).\nThe first 9 bits of a supervisory word are\nshifted out the end of the register. Bits 10 through 1.9 are the multiplexer\naddress and these bits fill the register prior to twentieth bit. A sync\npulse which is derived at the twentieth bit time transfers the 10 address\nbits in parallel into a holding register (Fll thru F20).\nThe Q and Q outputs are decoded by a two level decoder which was developed on contract\nNAS8-25066, "Remote Multiplexer". The first level decoder consists of AND\ngates which decode all the outputs of the ten bit storage register into\nthree groups. By combining various outputs of the three groups into three\ninput AND gates any of the 1024 possible addresses can be decoded. The\nsecond level decoder consists 18 three input AND gates and a printed circuit\ngrid matrix to connect the gates to the various first level group outputs\nas desired. Drawings 380-20 and 380-21 are diagrams of the decoders.\ne-. Multiplexer Addressing in Mode B\nDrawing 380-23, sheet 3 shows the address shift register connections\nfor Mode B operation. Flip-flops Fl thru F6 are connected to form a counter.\nFlip-Flops F7 thru F10 are hardwired to form the most significant bits of\nthe address which must be the same for all addresses in a specific multiplexer. Flip-Flops Fl thru F10 have their correct direct set or clear\ncircuits hard wired to Address Encode Logic (EA), which cyclically loads the\nsmallest numerical address into the flip-flops.\nThe address encode pulse occurs at the delayed sync pulse time. Another\npulse designated "Address Load and Update" (ALU) transfers the contents of\nthe counter - register into the address holding register and into the output\ndata register. ALU also increments the address in the counter register by\none count after transferral of the initial address to the holding register.\nALU occurs at every other sync pulse so that an address can be sent back to\nthe data terminal one word time followed by data the next word time. The\nALU pulse is generated by logic shown on drawing 380-23, sheet 1. Basically\nthis logic counts clock pulses and gates the count with the sync pulse.\nSince each word time represents an odd number of clock pulses a toggleconnected flip-flop- will alternate states at sync bit times and thus the\nALU is generated.\nAll eighteen addresses are loaded in the^ address register by ALU. At\nthe same time a count-to-eighteen counter A8 thru A18, drawing 380-23,\nsheet 1 counts ALU pulses to generate Address Encode EA which starts the\ncycle over. In mode B the incoming supervisory word is not loaded into the\naddress registers, but the clock and sync data are still obtained from the\nsupervisory word.\n\n28\n\nf.\n\nDemultiplexer Address Processing\n\nDemultiplexer addresses are received by the same address receiver as\nthe multiplexer. Decoding, however, is performed by a separate circuit\nbecause demultiplexing must be performed in both modes A and B which\nprohibits a common use of the decoder. Drawing 380-25 is the schematic\ndiagram of the demultiplexer\'decoder. Operation is the same as the multiplexer with some exceptions. The first difference is that two holding\nregisters are added to provide two additional word delays before an address\nis decoded. A second difference is that only the last eight bits of a\nsupervisory word need be decoded to perform all demultiplexing functions.\nThis number of bits will allow two bits for distinguishing demultiplexing\nfrom multiplexing and the remaining six bits can identify 64 addresses\nfor demultiplexing. Only eighteen, addresses are required per demultiplexer\nso one data terminal can interface with three separate MDU\'s. Another\nchange is the addition of a clock signal to the channel address decoders.\nThis clock signal is derived from the incoming data so that no clock will\nexist unless data is actually transmitted. This design takes care of the\nsituation where an address is sent down saying "demultiplex", but in the\nprocessing of data to follow,,a discovery is made that no valid data can be\nidentified. Consequently, the transmission .of no data is considered preferable to updating with questionable data.\nThe programmable decoder matrix in the demultiplexer is the same as the\nmultiplexer except for size.\n\n29\n\n3.\n\na.\n\nMultiplexer Data\n\nProcessing\n\nGeneral\n\nDrawings 380-52 and 380-53 are timing diagrams showing the relationship\nbetween supervisory words, and associated data. As was previously stated,\nthe multiplexer in mode A decodes a supervisory word; processes data during\nthe next word time; and sends data to the data terminal the second word time\nafter the address. The multiplexer in mode B generates an address; sends\nthe address back to the data terminal; and data related to the address is\nsent to the data terminal immediately after the address. In mode B, bits\n18 and 19 are always one\'s for an address and zeros for data so that the\ndata terminal can distinguish the two. Again repeating, the demultiplexer\ntiming.is independent of the mode of the multiplexer. Data for demultiplexing is received as the third word after the related address. It is important\n. to note that bits 12 and 13 of a supervisory word determine whether the word\ncontains a multiplexer or a demultiplexer address. Control logic for data\nprocessing will be described next.\n\nb.\n\n.Control Logic\n\nA nine stage Johnson counter is the foundation of the MDU control logic:\nThis counter is shown on drawing 380-22. Flip-flops FF1 through FF9 form\nthe.counter. Flip-flop FF10 inhibits the counter at bits 18 and 19. Various\nstates of the counter can be decoded spike free to control most of the data\nprocessing of the MDU. The counter operates continuously from clock pulses.\nWhen power is first applied to the system the states of the Flip-flop will\nbe random, but all of the output logic is gated with the address decoder so\nno operation occurs unless a valid address has been received. It is possible for a valid address to appear incorrectly at turn on, but the first sync\npulse will set all flip-flops of the control counter and address registers\nto correct states and the unit\'will operate correctly thereafter. Valid\naddresses are recognized by OR gates (A16, A17, A12) shown on:drawings 380-23,\nsheet 1. The outputs of the OR gates are inverted by AND gates (A12) and\nrouted to the control logic as signals LAI, LA2, LB. In mode A one of these\nsignals is always present with a correct address, but in mode B indications\nof correct address must be inhibited one word time before data processing\ncan occur so that the address can firpt be sent back to the data terminal.\nData Load (L) enables the gates outpufcing LAI, LA2, and LB in ode B. L is\ngenerated at alternate word times by using the odd bit count of a word from\nthe same toggle flip-flop that generates ALU. Drawing 380-53 shows the\ntiming diagrams of the control functions. The timing diagram is generally\nself-explanatory in the respect that logic equations are shown for functions\ngenerated by multiple states of the Johnson counter.- The use of the control signals is further defined in following descriptions of the various\ndata processing circuits.\n\n30\n\nc. Analog Data Processing\nDrawing 380-28 is a diagram of the multiplexer data\'sampling switch pc board. The switches are all double pole MOS-FET for balanced input to a\ndifferential amplifier. Two pc boards are-used in this MDU with only sixteen of the possible twenty channels being used on each board. The switches\nare divided into two equal groups per board, as can be seen from the diagram. Each switch has a separate control and each group of switches has\ntwo group controls. One group control (first level), which enables all\nswitches, is hardwired to +5 volts for continuous enable. The other group\ncontrol (2nd level), enables a double pole switch, which is in series with\nall channel switches in that group. The individual channels are enabled\nby a decode address. Two channels, one in each group, are enabled by a\ndecoded address applied to the channel controls, e.g., Cl and Cll, etc.\nThe second level controls are enabled by "ODD" .and "EVEN" control pulses\nCOA and CEA as shown on the timing diagram. COA enables one 2nd level control and CEA enables the other 2nd level control. This arrangement provides\nthe sequential sampling of two channels per address. In actual circuit\nconfiguration COAl, COA2, CEA1 and CEA2 are generated so that each multiplexer board has separate second level .controls. This is done by gating ,\nthe COA and CEA pulses with the valid analog address group signals Gl and\nG2 (drawing 380-23, sheet 1). This design minimizes input circuit capacity\nand also limits the number of channels to eight that could be conceivably\nimpared by any type of single channel failure.\nThe closing of a multiplexer switch connects data of the associated\nchannel to the input of a unity gain buffer amplifier (Al thru A4).\nThe\namplifier circuit is shown on the signal conditioner schematic diagram,\ndrawing 380-29. The amplifier is a proven circuit used previously on NASA\ncontract NAS8-25066, "Remote Multiplexer." At the time a valid analog\naddress is recognized the first associated data channel is sampled for 4\nbit times. During the sample time a sample-hold switch Ql is closed and a\nsample-hold capacitor C14 is charged to the data voltage. Capacitor C14\nis coupled to an A/D converter thru a high input impedance buffer amplifier\n(A6 and A7). As shown on the timing diagram, an A/D convert start pulse\nis generated the last 1/2-bit time of the sample. At the time of the sample\npulse trailing edge capacitor C14 is charged and isolated from the input\nand A/D conversion starts.\nThe sampled analog voltage is converted to an eight bit binary equivalent by .a successive approximation converter manufactured by Varadyne (Model\nADC-M8B2A1). This converter, shown diagramatically by drawing 380-27.,\nhas its own internal asynchronous clock. The conversion time is 3.8 microseconds maximu. Five bit times of the MDU are allowed for\' the conversion\nand after conversion is completed a load pulse transfers, in parallel, all\nof the eight bits of the A/D converter" into the. output register. At the\nsame time .the load pulse occurred the second analog switch associated\nwith the selected address closes and the data processing cycle is repeated\nfor the second word. During processing of the second word, data in\nthe output register is shifted toward the output so that the register is\nclear to accept the second word. The second word is loaded into the output\nregister on the eighteenth bit time. The data output register and other\ndata output circuits..are discussed in more detail in later paragraphs.\n\n31\n\nAnalog data processing is essentially the same for modes A and B except\nin mode A data output .occurs in response to a supervisory word and can\noccur as often as every word time. In mode B, however, data output always\noccurs every other word period.\nd. Binary Data Processing\nBinary data processing uses multiplexer switches identical with those\n.described for the analog data. . Two of the multiplexer circuit boards are\'\nalso used for binary multiplexing. Again, only 16 of the 20 possible channels on each board are used. One binary address, addresses a multiplexer\nboard by enabling the second level controls. Each group of eight channels\nis connected to its own buffer input amplifier. One buffer amplifier circuit consists of 1C amplifiers A8, A9, and AlO. The other amplifier circuit\nconsists of All, A12, and A13. This arrangement allows the sampling of two\nbinary channels at a time. At the time a binary address is valid, binary\nload pulses shown on the timing diagrams are generated from decoding of the\nJohnson counter. Eight sequencial pulses are generated .and each pulse\nenables two channel gates on the multiplexer boards. Binary, load pulses\ntransfer two binary bits at a time into the output data register until six-?\nteen bits of binary data have been loaded. Variations in operation between\nmodes A and B are the same as was described in the analog multiplexing\nsection.\ne. Data Output Circuits\nDrawing 380-27 previously mentioned to show the diagram of the A/D converter also shows the data output register. This output register consists\nof 20.flip-flops FF1 through FF20. All data except the parity bit is loaded\ninto flip-flops FF1 through FF10. Flip-flops FF11 through FF20 are primarily\nused for buffer storage so that the nineteen bit data words can be assembled\nfor ultimate transmission back to the data terminal. To some extent the\nloading of data has already been described, hut some of this description\nwill be repeated and expanded upon.\nWhen anaIpg data has been interrogated and converted to digital form\nthe parallel output bits of the A/D converter 2 through 2 are loaded intothe output register. Analog, odd or even, load commands enable gates\ncoupling the data to the direct sets of flip-flops FF3 through FF10.\nThe\nleast significant bit is set in FF3. A careful examination of the timing,\ndiagram will show that "odd" analog word is shifted into FF1 through FF18\nbefore the "even" analog word is loaded at the eighteenth clock time. In\nmode A operation FF1 and FF2 contain zeros. The nineteenth clock pulse\nshifts the 16 data bits into FF4 through FF19 and a zero is shifted into .\n\n32\n\nFF3. Since data is to be transmitted out beginning with the first bit of\nthe next word, the data register is properly loaded. The first bit of the\nnext word will shift 16 bits of data and one zero into FF4 through FF20\nand another zero will be loaded in FF3.\nData actually is being transmitted beginning at the first bit time of\nthe word after data processing, because Output Data Control (ODC) enables\nthe line driver so that the contents of FF20 actually appear on the data\nline. The generating circuit for ODC is shown on drawing 380-22, sheet 1.\nNormally, the output of FF12 is low which inhibits the line driver. When\na valid address occurs, a one is set into FF11. At the next sync bit time\n(end of referenced valid address) the one is transferred from FF11 to FF12\nand the line driver is enabled. At the same time a zero is clocked into\nFF11 if no new valid address is recognized. If a new address becomes valid ,\nFll retains a one, therefore, at the next sync time the ODC will go low if\nno new data is forthcoming or will remain high for any immediately followi.ng data.\nThe line driver is shown on sheet 2 of drawing 380-22.\nwith the data register by the logic gates shown\n\nIt is interfaced\n\n33\n\n4.\n\na..\n\nDemultiplexer Data Processing\n\nGeneral\n\nIf a supervisory word containing a demultiplexer address is received\nby the MDU, the address will have been shifted to the output of the demultiplexer decoder by three word times after the initiation of the address.\nRelated data will be arriving from the data terminal at the same time the .\nvalid address is decided. The address will be either associated with data\nrepresenting the binary equivalent of two analog words or with a binary\nword consisting of 16-bits of discrete data. If the data is intended as\nan analog output, data processing will end with D/A conversion. If the data\nis discrete, processing will end with parallel separation of the 16 bits.\nTiming diagrams are shown on drawing 380-53 and -54. Details of the\ncircuits are described as follows:.\n\'\nb.\n\nData Receiver\n\nThe incoming data has the same waveform and sync bit configuration as\nthe supervisory word. The data receiver (schematic diagram shown on drawing\n380-24, sheet 1) is identical with, the address receiver already described.\nc. . Analog Demultiplexing\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\nThere are 32 analog data output channels as previously indicated-. Each\nchannel output circuit consists of an output amplifier driven by an 8-bit . . \xe2\x80\xa2 \'\'\nD/A converter. An 8-bit storage register drives each D/A converter.\nTwo of these 8-bit registers are connected serially so that the 16 bits\nof incoming data representing the two words can be received serially.\n.\nWhen a correct address is decoded the decoder output, in effect, enables\nthe clock circuit to the appropriate pair of registers so that the 16 bits\ncan be loaded. The complement of the data is loaded into the reigsters\nbecause the D/A converter requires inverted logic to provide the desired\n0 to +5 volt input. Since incoming data is actually nineteen bits long,\n.\nlogic control from the MDU control counter is used to control the data\n.loading. The timing diagrams show that seventeen bits are actually shifted\ninto the register. The first bit is not real data and is shifted out the\nend. Bits 18 and 19 which are parity and undefined bits are not clocked\ninto the register. While the registers are being loaded the analog data\noutput may be changing with the bit variations, but the total response time\nof the amplifier and user circuits will be slow enough so that transient ;\nchanges will be ignored. Analog output data will correspond to the digital\ninput word within a few microseconds after the registers have been loaded.\nSchematic diagrams of analog demultiplexing circuits are shown by drawings\n380-24, sheet 3 and 380-26,sheets 1 .through 5.\n\n,\nj\ni\n\\\n]\n\n;\nj\ni\nj\nj\nj\nJ\ni\ni\ni\nj\n\n34\n\nd. Discrete Data Demultiplexing\nThe demultiplexer contains a serial input 16-bit shift register.\nDecoding of either of the two discrete data addresses enables the shift\nreigster clock so that data is clocked into the register. Seventeen bits\nof data are clocked into the register as is the case for the analog data.\nAgain the first bit, which is not real data, is clocked out of the register\nand bits 18 and 19 are not entered into the register. After the register\nis loaded a pulse, generated from the MDU control logic acts as a clock\nfor parallel entry of the sixteen bits into one of two sets of 16 storage/\noutput flip-flops. The decoded addresses enables a gate to route the load\npulse to the correct set of flip-flops. Binary demultiplexer circuitry\nis shown by drawing 380-24, sheet 2.\n\n35\n\nIV.\n\nINSTALLATION, OPERATION AND TESTING\n1.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe data terminal and demultiplexer are designed constructed and\ntested to operate in accordance with NASA/MSFC Specification Number\nGC-110547. These specifications provide for operation at laboratory\nenvironments only. The units as constructed will operate at a system\nclock rate of 1MHz but operation at any lower frequency is possible.\nFor any other frequency operation the one shot circuits that provide\nsync and clock pulses at the missing twentieth bit intervals must be\nmodified to time out at the center of the desired, time interval.\nThese changes are basically the changes of RC time constants. No\nother circuit modifications are required. Regardless of the frequency of operation, the knowledge of some design specifications\nother than presented by GC-110547 is desirable for optimum performance.\nThese are as follows:\nData Terminal\n.\n\nInput power:.\n16 watts/channel @ 28VDC\nSupervisory bus, Data bus, and local bus\nSignal Amplitudes: Positive going +4 +107= VDC\n.\n\'\n.\nNegative going - 4 +10% VDC\n. .\nZero level, signals - 0.7 to +0.7 VDC\n.\nMDU\n\nInput power:\n23 watts @ 28 VDC\nLocal bus signal amplitudes: Positive going +4 +10% VDC\nNegative going -4 +10% VDC\nZero level -0.7 to +0.7 VDC\n\n2.\na.\n\nData Terminal\n\n.\n\nInstallation and Operation\n\nWhile the installation of the data terminal in a system is relativelysimple, certain precautions must be observed. Wiring to the connectors\nshould conform with the connector arrangement drawing, Figure 2 , and\nwith the Pin Assignment list, Table 4.\n. Cables should be 75 ohm shielded\ntwisted pair similar to Trompeter, TWC-78-2.\nIf the data terminal is\ninterfaced via the main buses to only one other piece- of gear, such as\nthe bus controller no line termination is required.

In the case of the\ndata bus, however, the line must always have some termination at the\ncontroller and the most remo,te station. Depending on cable lengths,\nthe matching impedances are not necessarily restricted to as low a\nvalue as the cable characteristic impedance. However, if the cables\nare longer than 200 feet characteristic termination is. likely necessary.\nSince terminations on the lines do load line drivers, the drive\ncapability must be adequate to drive the terminations at required voltage\nlevels. It has already been specified that the prototype data terminal\nrequires plus and minus 4 volts. Obviously this may result in undesirably\nhigh powers. The power consumption can be reduced by increasing receiver\namplifier gains for operation at lower signal levels. This is fairly\neasily done by changing the feedback resistors. Increasing, receiver .\ngains, however, is not done without penalty. Signal to noise.ratios\nare reduced but this penalty may be acceptable if the amplifier gains\naren\'t made greater than 3.\n.\n; \'\nNo terminations will be required on local buses to the.MDU since\nthese lines are all 50 feet or less.\nAll bus controllers and/or other interfacing equipment must have\nline driver circuits with the appropriate 5-bit information skewing\nbetween the quad redundant buses, and this skew must be accurate to\n1/2 bit. Since local buses are not redundant to the MDU, no such\ncriterion exists for local buses.\n\nb.\n\nTesting\n\nNo specific test routines are recommended here for installed systems,\nexcept the general procedure of the Functional Test Plan and Procedure\nMCR-72-66 can be followed. This plan can be used directly if a basic\nsystem of a central controller one data terminal, and one or more\nMDU\'s is involved. If the system is more complex various procedures\nmust be established. General test routines can be established to monitor and correlate command functions, input/output data, and status. Automatic test routines and data analyses can be performed by interfacing\nthe system with a computer.\n\n40\n\n,\na.\n\n3.\n\nMultiplexer/Demultiplexer\n\n.\n\nInstallation and Operation\n\nOnly minimal precautions are necessary in the installation of the MDU.\nAll wiring connections must conform with the Connector Arrangement Drawing\nFigure 3, and the Connector Pin Assignment List, Table 5. Again\nshielded twisted pair are the recommended cables. As previously stated,\nlocal buses require no terminating loads. The terminations to the\nsubsystem data input/output circuits are also not critical except\nthey must conform to the requirements of the specifications. The\nprototype MDU is wired to operate with the address words listed\nin Table 6.\nb.\n\nTesting\n\nAgain no specific test routines are recommended for installed\nsystems except for the general procedures of the Functional Test Plan\nand Procedure MCR-72-66. Without an automated routine most testing is\nmore readily performed with Mode A connection because of difficulties\nin bookkeeping in Mode B. General accuracy and data reproducibility is\neasily tested in either mode but fault and impedance tests are difficult\nwith Mode B connections. Although the prototype MDU is constructed in\nMode B configuration most acceptance testing was done in Mode A.\nTherefore, a computerized check program looks especially appealling with\nMode B operation.\n\n41\n\n"\\ /"\n\nJ20\n\nJ19\n\nJ17\n\nJ16\n\nJ18\n\nMDU CONNECTOR ARRANGEMENT\nFIGURE\n\n3.\n\n42 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTABLE\n\n5\n\nMDU CHASSIS PIN CONNECTOR ASSIGNMENTS\nANALOG INPUT
