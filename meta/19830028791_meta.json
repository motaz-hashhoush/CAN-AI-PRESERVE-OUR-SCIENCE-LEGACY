Two synthetic aperture radar images of the ice edge region were obtained. In addition, a C-130 aircraft took aerial photographs and made active and passive microwave measurements and associated environmental measurements. The ship-based microwave observations gave values of the emissivity and backscatter of the different ice types in the MIZ over the spectral range covered by SMMR and at varying angles of incidence. In conjunction with the backscatter measurements, the ship and aircraft radiometry indicated the potential of a combined active/passive system for ice type determination. It was found that the ice edge could be located with an accuracy limited primarily by the geographical location of the SMMR fields of view. Ice concentration changes as deduced from the movement of buoys in the 200 x 200 km area with corresponding values for the SMMR ice concentration algorithm were found to be of the same order of magnitude", "title": "Nimbus-7 SMMR evaluation performed during the Norwegian remote sensing experiment /NORSEX/", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T14:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830028791, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Crawford, J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "04dfafb9357346b1a58ac734bdf1419e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19830028791, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Harrington, R.
