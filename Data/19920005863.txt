Activation of the segments of the drive coil is\nsynchronized such that the resulting traveling magnetic\nfield is always aft of the superconductor. Synchronization is accomplished with sensors disposed between\neach segment of the drive coil. With this arrangement,\nas the projectile passes each drive coil sensor, a signal is\nproduced which is used in providing energization of the\nnext adjacent drive coil segment to be activated.\nThe projectile preferably includes an arrangement for\nselectively supplying a liquid coolant, such as liquid\nnitrogen, to the superconducting layer or surface. This\narrangement advantageously includes a plurality of\ncoolant channels formed in the surface of a support wall\nfor the superconductive layer. The channels are preferably formed by a spiral groove in that surface. The\nsupply arrangement also includes a coolant tank and\nmeans for selectively releasing the coolant from the\ntank.\nOther features and advantages of the invention will\nbe set forth in, or apparent from, the following detailed\ndescription of preferred embodiments of the invention.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION O F T H E DRAWINGS\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a preferred embodiment of the present invention;\nFIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the projectile of\n30\nFIG. 1;\nFIG. 3 is an exploded cross-sectional view of the\nprojectile of FIG. 2;\nFIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view, drawn to an enlarged\nscale, of the aft section of the projectile of FIGS. 1 to 3;\nFIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view, drawn to an addi- 35\ntionally enlarged scale, of the conical tip of the projectile of FIGS. 1 to 4;\nFIG. 6 is a schematic side elevational view, partially\nin cross section, of a launcher control system in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present in- 40\nvention; and\nFIG. 7 is a schematic block diagram of the control\nand activation circuit of FIG. 6.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION O F T H E\nPREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\nReferring to FIG. 1, the basic components of a preferred embodiment of the present invention are shown.\nThe projectile launcher of the invention basically comprises a drive coil 20 for generating a travelling magnetic field 110, and a projectile (spacecraft) 10 adapted\nto be propelled by the travelling magnetic field 110\nwithin and along the drive coil 20. The projectile 10\ncomprises a payload section lOa, a separation section\n10b and a superconducting section lOc, the latter providing propulsion of projectile 10 by interaction with\nthe traveling magnetic field 110 via diamagnetic repulsion. The substantially tubular drive coil 20 forms a\nbarrel for launching the projectile 10. Both the drive\ncoil 20 and the projectile 10 have circular cross-sections\nwith the inner diameter of the drive coil 20 being sized\nso as to closely surround the projectile 10.\nAs discussed above, unlike other coaxial launchers of\nthe prior art, the projectile launcher of the present invention requires only a single activation coil, viz., the\naforementioned drive coil 20. The force between the\ndrive coil 20 and the superconducting section 1Oc of\nprojectile 10 is due entirely to diamagnetic repulsion\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n4\n\nbetween the travelling magnetic field 110 and the superconducting section 1Oc. More particularly, the travelling magnetic field 110 generates screening currents on\nthe surface of the superconducting section 1Oc. These\nscreening currents induce a second magnetic field,\nwhich , as discussed above, repels the travelling magnetic field 110 and prevents the travelling magnetic field\n110 from penetrating the superconductor section 1Oc.\nTherefore, a magnetic pressure is produced between the\nsurface of the superconducting section 1Oc and the travelling magnetic field 110.\nThe magnetic pressure produced is inversely related\nto the square of flux area. In the projectile launcher of\nthe present invention, the flux area is the difference\nbetween the inner area of the drive coil 20, Le., the\ncross-sectional area defined within the inner circumference of the drive coil, and the cross sectional area of the\nvolume enclosed by the superconducting section 1Oc.\nHigh thrust is achieved by tapering the superconducting section 1Oc of the projectile 10, thus producing a\nflux gradient in the magnetic field which, in turn, creates a high magnetic pressure vector in the forward\ndirection. Consequently, the magnetic pressure vanes\nfrom a maximum magnetic pressure at the forward end\nof the superconducting section 1Oc to zero magnetic\npressure at the extreme aft or tip of the tapered superconducting section 1Oc.\nThe magnetic pressure on the forward surface of the\nsuperconductor section 1Oc is equal to the magnetic\npressure existing between the drive coil 20 and the\nsurface of the superconductor section 1Oc parallel to the\ninner wall of the drive coil 20. Diamagnetic repulsion\nbetween the inner wall of the drive coil 20 and the\nprojectile 10 acts to maintain the superconductor section 1Oc in equilibrium near the center of the drive coil\n20.\nAs mentioned above and as is shown in more detail in\nFIGS. 2 and 3, the projectile 10 comprises three major\nsections, the forward payload section loa, the center\nseparation section 106, and the aft propulsion or superconducting section 1Oc. The payload section 10a itself\ncomprises an outer housing wall l l a which defines a\npayload cargo area 12a. As will be appreciated, the\nshape of the payload cargo area 12u can be designed to\naccept various payload configurations. The separation\nsection 106 contains insulation 116 and includes a bulkhead or isolating wall 126 provided to insulate the payload from the propulsion section 1Oc. The insulation 116\nis used to fill any void that may exist in the propulsion\nsection. Additionally, the separation section 106 may\nhouse mechanisms (not shown) to further separate the\npayload from the propulsion section 1Oc.\nThe superconducting section 1Oc is composed of an\nouter shell of superconductive material, denoted l l c , an\ninner housing 12c, a nitrogen tank 13c including liquid\nnitrogen indicated at 14c, and a nitrogen supply line 15c.\nThe nitrogen tank 13c is disposed within the inner housing 1 2 . As illustrated in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the inner\nhousing 1 2 , which includes a cylindrical portion and an\naft portion that is substantially conical in shape, constitutes the main support wall of the superconducting\nsection 1Oc. The nitrogen supply line 15c connects the\ninner housing 12c to the nitrogen tank 13c at an inlet\npoint 16c in inner housing 12c so as to enable liquid\nnitrogen 14c from tank 13c to be supplied thereto. More\nspecifically, as illustrated in FIG. 4 and shown in more\ndetail in FIG. 5, the outer surface of the inner housing\n12c includes a spiral passage or channel 17c machined\n\n5\n\n5,017,549\n\ntherein which is connected to inlet point 16c and which\nspirals around the outer surface of housing 12c up to the\nconical tip thereof. Spiral channel 17c thus enables liquid nitrogen to be supplied to the surface of inner housing 12c over the length thereof As can best be seen in 5\nFIG. 4, the width of the spiral channel 17c is somewhat\ngreater at the conical tip portion of semiconducting\nsection 1Oc than at the cylindrical portion.\nAs noted above, a layer of superconductive material\nllc is securely adhered to the exterior of the inner hous- 10\ning 1 2 and has the same cylindrical-conical shape. As\n,\nillustrated in FIG. 5 the conical tip of the superconductor layer llc includes an exit aperture 1 for the liquid\n&\nnitrogen 14c. In operation, the liquid nitrogen 14c flows\nthrough and along the machined path 16c between the 15\nceramic/superconductor interface to the conical tip.\nAs is best seen in FIG. 5, which is a detail of the\nconical tip of section lOc, in one preferred embodiment\nof the invention, control of the flow of the liquid nitrogen 14c is effected using a piezoelectric plug assembly 20\n1 c Piezoelectric plug assembly 18c is composed of a\n8.\nsealing surface material 19c, a cylindrical piezoelectric\n0.\nceramic element 2 c and associated electrodes 21c.The\ncylindrical piezoelectric ceramic element 2Oc is poled\nsuch that, when a voltage is applied across the elec- 25\ntrodes 21c,the diameter of the cylindrical piezoelectric\nceramic element 20c is reduced. In use, the piezoelectric\nceramic element 20c is forced out of the sealing surface\nmaterial 19c by the pressure in the liquid nitrogen tank\n13c, thus initiating the flow of the liquid nitrogen, indi- 30\ncated at 14c, down the spiral machined path 17c, and\nthereby providing the required cooling of the superconductive material llc. It will be understood that the\npiezoelectric ceramic element 20c is placed in the seaiing material 19c before the liquid nitrogen 14c is placed 35\nin the tank 13c. It will also be appreciated that other,\ndifferent forms of control for the liquid nitrogen can be\nprovided including a control valve (not shown) in suppIy line 15c or a frangible diaphragm (not shown) at the\n40\nconical tip of the semiconducting section 1Oc.\nIt is noted that it is only necessary to cool the superconducting material llc to a superconducting state\nduring the time which the projectile is accelerated so\nthat coolant is not supplied to channel 17c when the\nprojectile 10 is not in use and is, e.g., being stored. Fur- 45\nther, the projectile 10 is preferably stored in an insulated\ncontainer (not shown) until just prior to launch.\nReferring to FIG. 6, a control system for the drive\ncoil 20 is shown. The control system includes a plurality\nof laser light sources 31 disposed in serial relation along 50\none side of coil 20 between the turns of the coil, as\nillustrated, and a corresponding plurality of optical\nsensors 32 which are disposed in serial relationship\nalong the opposite side of coil 20 between the turns\nthereof, so that an optical sensor 32 is positioned oppo- 55\nsite each\xe2\x80\x99of said laser light source 30.The drive coil 20\nitself comprises a plurality of drive coil segments 33\nwhich are energized independently of one another\nunder the control of an activation and control circuit 34.\nThe travelling magnetic field 110 is generated by 60\nsequentially energizing each segment 33 of the coil 20.\nThe activation of each drive coil segment 33 is controlled by control circuit 34 and is synchronized such\nthat the resulting traveling magnetic field 110 is always\nlocated aft of the projectile 10.This synchronization is 65\naccomplished using the optical sensors 32 disposed between each drive coil segment 33. In particular, each\nsensor normally receives a laser light beam 35 from the\n\n6\n\nlaser light source 31 located thereacross. Thus, as the\nprojectile 10 moves along coil 20, the forward and aft\ntips of the projectile 10 will pass by and thus block or\nunblock a laser beam or beams 35 from individual ones\nof the light sources 31,in sequence, so as to permit the\nlaser light to not fall or to fall on the corresponding\noptical sensor 32.Accordingly, the position of the projectile 10 in the coil 20 can be determined from the\noptical sensors 32 which are not receiving laser light.\nConsidering this operation further, refemng to the\nexample illustrated in FIG. 6 and assuming that projectile 10 is moving from right to left, and considering that\ncoil activation is due to the motion of the aft tip, for the\nposition of projectile 10 illustrated, a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d light sensor\nhas just been unblocked and this sensor, and all other\nsensors 32 located downstream thereof, are illuminated\nby corresponding laser light beams 35. On the other\nhand, the next adjacent light sensor and all other sensors\n32 upstream thereof which lie laterally adjacent to projectile 10, are still blocked by the projectile. As each\nnew light sensor 32 is unblocked, Le., exposed to the\ncorresponding laser light beam 35 by the passage of\nprojectile 10 thereby, that sensor generates an output\nsignal which is transmitted to activation and control\ncircuit 32.Thus, in operation, as the projectile 10 passes\nby each \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d drive coil sensor 32, a corresponding\nsignal is transmitted to activation and control circuit 34\nwhich, in turn, causes the next forward or upstream\ndrive coil segment 33 to be activated, thereby generating the new leading edge of the traveling magnetic\ndrive field 110. It will be appreciated that control circuit 34 can be simple in construction in that the purpose\nthereof is simply to receive a position or timing signal\nfrom the laser light sensors 32 and to generate a corresponding energizing signal for the appropriate coil signal 33 based on that signal.\nReferring to the example in FIG. 7,a schematic block\ndiagram of a simple implementation of the activation\nand control circuit 34 is shown. The heart of this system\n~\nis a computer 3 4 (such as made by IBM, Apple, and\nothers) which is connected to a laser activation circuit\nor module 346, a coil activation circuiter module 34c.\nand the optical sensors 32 (not shown in FIG. 7. con)\nnection to these are accomplished through interface\ncards (not shown) for the IEEE-480 bus which are\ndesigned to directly plug into the expansion slots of\nmost computers. Interface boards for data acquisition\nand control, together with the software to control them\ncan be purchased through such companies as the MetraByte Corporation, 4-40 Myles Standish Boulevard,\nTaunton, Mass., 02780. The computer 34a,by means of\nthe interface boards and programming, initiates the\nsupply of power to the lasers 31 (not shown in FIG. 7)\nthrough the laser activation module 346, as well as\nreceives signals from optical sensors 32, and decodes\nthe signals and directs the coil activation module 34c to\nsupply power to whichever coil segment 20 needs\npower. The laser activation module 346 can be simple\ncomposed of a relay switch (not shown) which, when\nclosed, allows power to be applied to the lasers. The\ncoil activation module 34c can also be simply composed\nof multiple relays (not shown) which direct power from\nmultiple charged capacitive banks 34d to the individual\ncoil segments as is required to propel the projectile 10.\nAlthough the present invention has been described\nrelative to specific exemplary embodiments thereof, it\nwill be understood by those skilled in the art that variations and modifications can be effected in these exem-\n\n7\n\n5,817,549\n\nplary embodiments without departing from the scope\nand spirit of the invention.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.
