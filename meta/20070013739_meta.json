Within this preview, the mission of this project is to provide cross cutting solution network and rapid prototyping capability for the Gulf of Mexico region, in order to demonstrate substantial, collaborative, multi-agency research and transitional capabilities using unique NASA data sets and models to address regional problems. SERVIR Mesoamerica is seen as an excellent existing framework that can be used to integrate observational and GIs data bases, provide a sensor web interface, visualization and interactive analysis tools, archival functions, data dissemination and product generation within a Rapid Prototyping concept to assist decision-makers in better understanding Gulf-scale environmental issues.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20070013739, "endDate": "2006-12-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "SERVIR Summit", "location": "Syracuse, NY", "id": "411aa3c536dc44a5981b7dc966cd7572", "startDate": "2006-12-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070013739, "id": "eeb2be7a8b8145adaddcc9eabaecd4c6", "publicationDate": "2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
