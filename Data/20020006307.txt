These components\nare required to\noperate at high speed and load and for an extremely\nlarge\nnumber of cycles in these applications.\nAn example of spiral\nbevel gears use in a rotorcraft drive system is shown in Fig. 1\n[1]. In this application spiral bevel gears are not only used to\nturn the corner from the horizontal engines to the vertical rotor\nbut also as a means of combining the two engines to power the\nmain and tail rotor shafts.\nGears that are manufactured\nfor this purpose are made to the\nhighest quality economically\nattainable (AGMA quality 12 and\nhigher, usually [13-14]) and using the best current materials.\nUtifizing these specialty manufacturing\nmachine tools and\ncomputer numerical\ncontrolled coordinate\nmeasurement\nhas\n\nNASA/TM-----2001-210940\n\nFigure 1.--UH-60\nsection.\n\n1\n\nhelicopter main rotor transmission cross\n\nprocessouldbefoundthatcouldreducehe number\nc\nt\nof\n\nTable 1 Basic spiral bevel gear\ndesign data\n\nmanufacturing\nsteps, this would reduce costs and lower the\nchances that a particular manufacturing\nstep will cause the gear\nto be scrapped.\nThe project to be described\nin this report compares the\noperational\nbehavior of face-milled,\nthe current manufacturing process for spiral bevel gears used in aerospace applications, to face-hobbed\nspiral bevel gears that have potential\nmanufacturing\ncost savings. Testing results on spiral bevel\ngears in general have limited availability in the open literature,\nas the majority of information\nfound has been done on parallel\naxis gears. There have been some studies that have looked at\nmeasurements,\nsimilar to the data taken in this report, within\n\nNumber of teeth pinion/gear\nDiametral pitch (I/in.)\nMean spiral anglc (deg)\nMean cone distance (in.)\nFace width (in.)\nNominal pressure an_le (de_)\nShaft angle (deg)\n\n12/36\n5.141\n35.0\n3.191\n1.0\n22.5\n90.0\n\nhigh-speed helicopter gearboxes or in specially fabricated test\nrigs for intersecting axis gears [ 1,5-10]. However these results\nhave only been on face-milled spiral bevel gears.\nTest hardware was manufactured\nto fit within the NASA\nGlenn\n\nResearch\n\nCenter\n\nSpiral Bevel\n\nGear Test Facility\n\nand\n\ngears were manufactured\nto aerospace\nquality. Tests were\nconducted for stress, vibration and noise. A comparison of the\nresults attained will be presented.\nGEAR\n\nMANUFACTURE\n\nSpiral bevel gears were manufactured\nusing two different\nmanufacturing\nmethods. Face-milled\nand face-hobbed\ngears\nwere manufactured\nto fit within the NASA Glenn Research\nCenter Center Spiral Bevel Gear Test Facility. The basic\ndesign data for these gears are shown in Table 1. Gears were\nmanufactured\nto aerospace precision quality.\nThe difference between the two different manufacturing\nmethods is shown in Fig. 2 [11,12]. During the tooth generation process, in the face-_lling\ntechniqUe, the grinding wheel\n\ni\n\ninteracts with one tooth space and is then indexed to the next\nlocation (cutting or grinding). The process continues until all\ntooth spaces are finish cut to the required depth. In the facehobbing technique\nindividual\ncutting blades interact with\ndifferent tooth spaces. Face-hobbing\nis a continuously\nindexing tooth generation process, where all the teeth are cut a little\nat a time, until all the teeth are finished to the final desired\ndepth. Test hardware that was face-milled was manufactured\nusing grinding as the final machining process to the gears. For\nthe face-hobbed\ngears the final operation is the hard-cutting\nprocess. Both manufacturing\ntechniques gave similar surface\ntexture and roughness. The pinions manufactured\nfrom the two\ndifferent methods are shown in Fig. 3.\n\n""\\\n\n\\_,\n\n:(/\ni\n\ni\n\\\n\nTEST\n\nFACILITY/TEST\n\nSET-UP/TEST\n\nNASA/TM--2001-210940\n\n\xc2\xa2\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nThe test facilities that were used to conduct the experimental studies are located at NASA Glenn. The test facility is a\nclosed-i00p\ntorque regenerative facifity:that tests two Sets\nof spiral bevel gears at the same time. A sketch of the facility\nis shown in Fig. 4.

The rest\nof the load is applied using a floating helical gear that is forced\ninto mesh via a thrust piston. The loop torque is meas-ured at\nthe test gear shaft side within the loop. Facility operational\nparameters are measured and recorded via a laboratory computer.\nThe test hardware\n\nwas instrumented\n\n(b)\n\nL.

(b) Facility cross section.\n\nfor these tests using\nAll root gages operated adequately over the test performed.\nHigh frequency accelerometers\nwere also installed just above\nthe pinion in the beating support housing on both the test and\nslave sides. A hand-held sound level meter was used to make\n\nstrain gages. The gages were placed in the fillet and root areas\nto investigate the differences of the strain measured due to the\nface-milled and face-hobbed geometry differences. The strain\ngages used were only 0.38 mm (0.015 in.) active gage length\nto fit within the root and fillet regions without being immediately damaged by the meshing action of the teeth. An example\nof the strain gage arrangement\nis shown in Fig. 5. Strain gages\nwere placed in position using a microscope.\nFillet gages are the\nmost troublesome\nwith respect to placement. As will be seen\nlater, many of the gages applied in this region were damaged\nin the build-up/pattern\nchecking operation prior to operation.\n\nNASA/TM----2001-210940\n\n_- Spiral bevel\nslave section\n\nqualitative noise measurements.\nmeasurements\nwill be described\n\nAll the test procedures\nand\nin-depth later in this report.\n\nContact pattern development\nand backlash measurements\nare part of the normal setup procedure for spiral bevel gears.\nContact patterns for the face-milled\nand face-hobbed\ngears at\nhigher load (-282 Nom (2500 in.\xc2\xb0lb) at the pinion shaft) are\nshown in Fig. 6. The one main item to note is that teeth on the\n\n3\n\nFigure 5.--Close-up\n\nof strain gauge and associated wiring.\n\nface-hobbed\ngears use a larger percentage\nof the available\ntooth profile than the face-milled\nteeth. Use of more of the\ntooth surface should intuitively\nhave improved operational\ncharacteristics.\nThe procedure followed to conduct the tests was the following. First the facility was warmed up via the lube systems\nto the point where the lubrication inlet temperature for the test\nhardware was -71 \xc2\xb0C (160 \xc2\xb0F). The strain gage instrumentation was balanced at zero applied load. Next, calibration\nsignals were applied to the tape recording system (used for\nstrain gages and vibration data). Finally the necessary torque\nwas applied prior to test operation through the split coupling.\nOnce a set point of speed and torque were reached, data was\nrecorded on tape for a predetermined\nperiod of time (typically\n1 rain).\nDATA\n\nACQUISITION\n\nData was taken for the test hardware\n\nusing strain gages,\n\nhigh frequency accelerometers,\nand a sound level meter. Data\nfrom the strain gages and accelerometers\nwas recorded on FM\ntape for post-test processing. The noise measurements\nwere\nmade using a hand-held sound level meter.\nThe tape-recorded\ndata was downloaded\nto a personal\ncomputer\nusing analog to digital boards contained\nwithin\nthe personal computer. Dynamic data was time synchronous\naveraged using a once-per-revolution\nsensor attached to the\ngear shaft. For each revolution of the gear the pinion rotates\n3 revolution (3:1 ratio). For the strain gage data that will be\npresented later, the data was typically averaged for 50 revolution of the gear shaft, All dynamic data was taken after set point\nconditions were reached (speed and load) for several minutes.\nSince strain gages have a finite life at high strain rates the\nfacility was not operated for long periods while waiting for\nthermal equilibrium to be reached.\nThe strain gage wiring passed through a high-speed slip\nring prior to being recorded on the FM tape recorder. No\nfiltering of the raw data was made and all dynamic data was\nrecorded at 30 in./sec tape speed.\n\nNASA/TM--2001-210940\n\nFigure 6.--High 10adcrntaet\npatterns for gears.\n(a) Face-milled. (b) Face-hobbed.\n\nThe strain gage data was then downloaded\nto a personal\ncomputer. Calibration\nsignals recorded on the tape recorder\nprior to operation were used to correct the tape recorder\noutput. Once the data was corrected for tape recorder errors,\nthe signals were then corrected for gage drift. The data was\ntransformed\nfrom voltage to strain using shunt calibration\ninformation\nfrom each of the strain gage channels.\nFinally\nthe strain was transformed\nto stress assuming\na uniaxial\nstress field.\n\n4\n\nThevibration\ndatathatwastaken\nused\nhigh-frequency\naccelerometers.\nTheoutput\nfromtheseensors recorded\ns\nwas\ndirectly nthe recorder\no\ntape\nwithout\nanyfiffering. output\nThe\nwasplayed\nbackinto a spectrum\nanalyzer.\nThedatawas\naveraged\n(25averages) the\nover spectrum 0to12.8\nfrom\nkHz.\nHanning indowing\nw\nwasused\nonthesignalsnalyzed.\na\nThe\ndatareported\nlaterwill showthefundamental\nandnext\nharmonic\nofthemeshing\nfrequency.\nThe noise measurements\nwere made using a hand-held\nsound level meter using the "A\'" weighted scale.

All\nresults attained from the two different\ngear tooth surface\ngeometries will then be compared for each of the measurement\ntypes made.

As can be seen, the fillet locations\nproduced\nthe highest tensile stress and the root locations\nproduced the highest compressive\nstress. A comparison of the\n\nin the same test facility in an earlier\n\nstudy [6]. The mid face fillet gages produced the highest strain\n(stress) and the toe and heel gages meas-ured lower values.\nFor the face-hobbed pinion the strain gage that was located\nat the mid face fillet location failed prior to any testing and only\nthe two gages located at the heel locations produced data in the\n\nTable 2 Strain gage location and results from experiments for face-milled spiral bevel gears\n\nNASA/TM--2001-210940\n\n(b) l\n\nOne thing to note from the results of Fig. 7 is that the root gage\noutput was different for the two different gear types. The root\ngages on the face-milled\npinion had the maximum alternating\nstress at the mid position root gage and the face-hobbed\npinion\nhad the maximum alternating stress at the heel position.\nA complete summary of the strain gage data taken for the\nface-milled and face-hobbed pinions is shown in Tables 2 and\n\nstrain gage output is shown in Fig. 7 for\npinion.

The magnitude of the alternating stress absolute values\nis presented. As can be seen from this figure, the face-milled\ngear type produced the highest alternating stress at the midface position, and the face-hobbed\ngear type produced the\nhighest alternating\nstress at the heel position at the highest\ntorque conditions.\nThe maximum alternating stress value of\nthe face-hobbed\npinion was at least 10% less than that of the\nface-milled pinion at all conditions.\n\nA-weighted scale. The results from the two different gear mesh\ntypes are shown in Table 5.

As can be seen from the data, the gear meshing\nfrequency dominated\nthe vibration.

While the data was all favorable\nfrom the face-hobbed\ntest hardware, this is still only a single\n\nages. The data from the conditions tested is shown in Table 4.\nAll data was taken from the test side vibration where the pinion\ndrives the gear in the normal speed reducer mode. The first or\nfundamental\nmeshing frequency\nand the next harmonic are\npresented.\nFrom the table the data indicates that the facemilled gears produced higher vibration for similar conditions\nat the fundamental\nmeshing frequency. The face-milled hardware however had begun to have a surface scoring damage at\nthe two higher speed and load conditions. Both gear types\nindicated\na trend of increasing\nvibration\nwith the power\ndelivered through the gear mesh. The peak loading condition\nwas at 353 kW (474 hp).\n\napplication. Since manufacturing\ncosts should be reduced for\nthe face-hobbed\ntest hardware spiral bevel gears, due to the\nreduction in time to manufacture\nand number of machines\nrequired to complete the part, cost reduction\nmance degradation\nshould be attainable.\n\nwithout\n\nperfor-\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nNoise Results\nThe noise results were attained using a hand-held\nsound\nlevel meter. The sound level meter was held -15 cm (6 in.)\nfrom the lexan cover of each side of the test facility and the\nmaximum value noted.
