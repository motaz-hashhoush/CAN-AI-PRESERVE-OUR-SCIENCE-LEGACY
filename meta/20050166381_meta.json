The OBSS is a laser-and-imaging-sensor- equipped 50-ft. extension to the existing 50-ft. arm, increasing the shuttle's reach to 100 ft. The return-to-flight mission will debut the autonomous robotic self-inspection capability to detect and possibly aid the repair of the type of damage that doomed Columbia and her crew, were it to occur again. With 3D imaging and laser contour-mapping capability, the OBSS will enable the diagnosis of cracks in reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) wing and nose areas and thermal protection system (TPS) tiles beyond the view of the standard manipulator arm. Given the major changes to the shuttle external tank, no damage is expected. But the OBSS is a direct response to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board's recommendations. The new boom and a significant amount of its supporting software was developed by MacDonald Dettwiler heads. Space and Advanced Robotics Ltd. (MD Robotics) in Brampton, Ontario, a key contractor in the shuttle program for 25 years. The Canadian Space Agency is also heavily involved in supporting shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) robotics.", "title": "Self-Examination", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T04:57:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050166381, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Covault, Craig"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "d8a0e0995e79443ba88da188cbd38677"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050166381, "publications": [{"volume": "162", "submissionId": 20050166381, "issue": "18", "issn": "0005-2175", "id": "77fc088f8dc84285bc460da3c54bde74", "publicationName": "Aviation Week and Space Technology", "publicationDate": "2005-05-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
