A dynamic editing display technique and a static microfilm\nmethod are described. These editing techniques have been used to reduce the cost of\nprocessing large volumes of r e s e a r c h data and of eliminating redundant data. They have\na l s o been helpful to the engineer in detecting faulty instrumentation and defining processing instructions.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe volume of recorded digital r e s e a r c h data at Lewis Research Center far exceeds\nthe amount of data which can be reasonably processed by the existing computer systems.\nIncreasing the computer processing capability would result in a direct increase in cost\nf o r additional computing equipment and computing personnel. Since only a portion of the\nrecorded data is essential to the solution of a n experimental problem, the processing of\nredundant or superfluous data can be eliminated without adversely effecting the results\nof the experiment. In any data processing system identifying and eliminating redundant\nand faulty data as e a r l y as possible in the processing sequence produces the largest reduction in cost. Also, the technique of visually editing the data before processing provides a method of identifying redundant or faulty data and provides the contrdls to eliminate its processing.\nP r i o r t o the work described herein, editing at Lewis was done on a s m a l l digital\ncomputer with a cathode -ray tube display device and light pen (ref. 1). This digital dis\nplay was moved from the s m a l l computer and interfaced with a large general purpose\ntime -sharing computer. Function keys were added as communication devices to the display system. The display software system, which was rewritten to run on the timesharing system, utilizes the large core and disc capabilities of the computer. This revision resulted i n a n expanded dynamic display system on a large time-sharing computer\n\n-\n\nproviding u s e r communication by means of function keys, a light pen, and a communication terminal. A second and different approach to editing, using a microfilm recorder,\nwas a l s o developed f o r the time-sharing system. This technique produces a permanent\nrecord of the data on microfilm which may be reviewed at the u s e r \' s convenience.\nThe final result is a comprehensive editing system on a time-sharing computer\nwhich provides flexability in the editing of r e s e a r c h data. The r e s e a r c h engineer has the\nchoice of selecting the method which best satisfies his requirements for successfully\nediting his data. The data editing system described herein has been in operation for several y e a r s at Lewis.\n\nOverview of the System\nLewis Research Center is engaged in the recording and processing of large amounts\nof experimental data. Transient or high speed recording systems located at Lewis or the\nPlum Brook Station digitize the data at rates from 2 to 30 kilohertz and record them on\nmagnetic tape. A computerized data reduction system, which is available at Lewis,\nprocesses and analyzes the data. The data recorded on the tape a r e the output of test instruments used during the running of a n experiment. These data are separated into readings, where a reading corresponds to the data recorded under a unique set of test conditions and identified by a unique number. A reading consists of many data blocks o r s c a n s\nthrough all channels of a sampling sequence (order in which the channels are digitized).\nEach channel represents the output of one instrument of the experiment.\nThe editing system is designed to operate on the IBM 360 Model 67 computer under\nthe control of the TSS/360 time -sharing system. This computer controls various peripheral devices that are functionally available t o u s e r s wishing to edit recorded data. Since\nthese recorded data are stored on magnetic tape, the computer uses tape drives as its\nbasic input devices for editing. Communication between the display s y s t e m s and the computer is initiated by any of a number of communications terminals attached to the 360/67.\nThe display of data is done either on a CDC Model DD-20 display device o r on a CDC\nModel DD-280 display.\nThe DD-20 display consists of a large (15-in. (38.1-cm) diameter) cathode-ray display tube mounted in a console unit and a n associated control unit. The control unit contains a separate core memory which stores the control information and data necessary to\ncontinuously r e f r e s h the display tube. A light pen attached to the display console is used\nto select points on the screen. Information concerning these points is transmitted to the\nediting program through the control unit. Function keys on the face of the console are\nanother means of communication between the editor and the display program; these keys\npermit unique predetermined functions to be requested of the display program. Depressing a function key interrupts the computer and provides identification of the key depressed\n2\n\nto the display program. The DD-280 display consists of a 14 by 14 inch (35.6 by 35.6\ncm) cathode-ray s c r e e n and two DD-280 35-millimeter microfilm r e c o r d e r s . The m i crofilm c a m e r a s photograph the plotted information displayed on the face of 5.25-inch\n(13.34-cm) cathode-ray tubes. Data editing may then be performed either dynamically\non the s c r e e n of the DD-20 display or by using permanently recorded microfilm plots.\nThe time -sharing system (TSS/360) is a very comprehensive computer operating\nsystem which permits many u s e r s to simultaneously perform scientific calculations. In\nother words, one display user may be performing editing t a s k s at the s a m e time many\nother computer u s e r s are accomplishing tasks of their own. The time-sharing system\noperates i n such a manner that each user seemingly has complete use of the computer. *\n\n.\n\nDynamic Editing\nThe dynamic editing system enables the engineer to interact with a digital display of\nhis r e s e a r c h data. The display program uses a light pen, function keys, and a communication terminal t o facilitate this interaction (fig. 1). Commands to the display program\nare entered through either the function keys or the terminal. The function keys are a\nmore efficient communications device than the typewriter for requests that do not require\ndescriptive information through the typewriter.\nThe editor must use the terminal to request the initial reading he wishes to review.\nSubsequent readings on the tape may be requested for display by using a function key or\nthe terminal. When a requested reading is located, it is read from the tape and stored\nin the computer. The identifying information and the total number of data blocks in that\nparticular reading are displayed as alphanumeric information on the screen. The display\nof selected data channels may be initiated at this time. T o enter a s e t of channel numbers through the terminal, a function key is depressed which will request the system to\ninitiate the terminal f o r input. The terminal then indicates to the user that he may proceed to enter the command (in this case, channel number). The data are displayed as\ndata points as functions of a time plot of up to four channels; each plot is on a separate\naxis and identified by channel number.\nThe length of a high-speed data reading frequently exceeds the number of points\nwhich can be plotted on DD-26 screen. To enable the engineer to review the complete\nreading, data from this reading may be plotted i n either of two modes - reference or expanded. A reference plot selects representative points from the entire reading to produce a general picture of the data. A r e a s which the engineer wishes to review in g r e a t e r\ndetail are selected by the light pen and the plot is expanded t o include all data points from\nthis starting point (up to the maximum number of points allowed on the screen). The expanded display may now be shifted along the time axis i n either direction. This "move\nmode" uses two of the function keys to control the direction of the shift and the light pen\n3\n\nto select the start or end of the new area. This move mode has been found to be useful\nf o r editing readings of great length and is a comprehensive method for locating instrument failure or determining which areas are important for processing.\nThe appropriate function keys may be used t o sequence through additional channels\nfrom the s a m e reading, t o input the next reading for display, and to add or delete a grid.\nAppendix A lists the complete set of commands available in the display editing program.\nPerhaps the most important function of the light pen is its ability to communicate to\nthe pr,ogram enough information to determine the magnitude and the real time of a selected data point (fig. 2). The point selected by the light pen is blinked on the display\nscreen. The time and magnitude (in percent of full scale) of this data point are displayed\nin alphanumeric c h a r a c t e r s at the bottom of the screen. This information can be used to\nlocate m a r k e r channel changes o r other significant events in the data.\nVarious other functions are available to handle specific editing needs. One of these\nis a display of data i n a channel as a function of channel rather than the standard channel\nas a function of time mode. This display format has proved to be of value t o those engineers wishing to observe phase relations in related data channels. Several channels may\na l s o be plotted together on the s a m e axis (fig. 2). This feature compares similar data t o\ndetect faulty instrumentation. Sufficient information may be obtained from the channels\ncontaining the faulty data to enable the engineer to c o r r e c t the instrumentation before\nfurther data are recorded. The engineer may also determine the necessary corrective\naction which should be taken before processing. The processing program may then be\ninstructed to either avoid processing the faulty data altogether o r to substitute other useful o r theoretical data f o r the questionable data. Sometimes it is more useful to tag or\ncode out the channels representing the output of the faulty instruments before processing.\nA code-out is a tag or bit appended to the data word and transmitted (propagated) with the\ndata through all processing steps. The tagged arithmetic system (ref. 3) performs the\ncalculations with the data values and tags the r e s u l t s rather than replacing the tagged\nvalue with a preselected value. On a printout the tag is represented by a literal character to the right of the data value.\nFacilities which record very s h o r t data readings may be interested in displaying the\ndata for s e v e r a l or all of their readings at one time. This type of display is initiated by\nrequesting that the editing program s t o r e the entire set as if it were a single reading.\nDuring this mode of display all of the basic editing commands are available t o the editor.\nHowever, when a data point is selected by the light pen, the reading to which the data\npoint belongs is reported r a t h e r than the time of the point. The engineer is thus able to\nobtain quickly and with ease a display of a n entire set of readings and at the same time\nrequest information about specific readings in the set.\n\n4\n\nSTATIC ED ITlNG\nThe static editing system produces a permanent record of selected recorded data\nthrough the use of the microfilm recorder and Lewis\'s microfilm plotting package\n(ref. 2). This editing program r e a d s the recorded data from magnetic tape and cons t r u c t s time plots of up t o eight channels of data similar to the display constructed by the\ndigital display editing system. The resultant picture is transmitted t o the microfilm recorder along with the necessary identifying information (facility, program and reading\nnumbers, initial time of the reading, run date, and channel numbers) and the microfilm\nis then produced (figs. 3 and 4). The number of time points in a reading may exceed the\nnumber of points which can be plotted on a standard frame of microfilm. To produce a\ncontinuous plot of the data for the channels requested, the f r a m e size is expanded (called\nf r a m e butting) and all data points from these channels are displayed regardless of the\nlength of the reading. Data which are questionable, either because they are out of range\no r are coded out on the input data tape, are flagged (marked). Figure 4 is an example of\na data plot which includes faulty o r out-of-range data.\nThe engineer has the option of specifying beforehand that all or only certain channels\nare to be microfilmed. The user may also request that other specified channels (such as\nmarker channels) are to be scanned f o r marked changes i n the magnitude of the data.\nThe specific times of these changes (in addition t o their value if requested) are printed on\nthe microfilm as alphanumeric characters (fig. 5).\nCoordinate grids at fixed time intervals may be requested, thereby providing a time\nscale for the engineer to use in his analysis of the data (fig. 6). Time can then be used\nas a control to selecting data for processing. Figure 6 illustrates the technique of expanding the Y-scale, which allows the detailed study of, or comparison of, particular\nmeasuring instruments.\nData recorded on the high-speed digital recording system a r e microfilmed when the\ndata are received in the computing center, unless otherwise instructed by the user. The\nprocessed film is given t o the engineer who may then review his data at any of s e v e r a l\nmicrofilm viewers located around the laboratory. The obvious advantage to this method\nof editing data is that the engineer may review his data quickly and at his convenience.\nFor the engineer who needs only to input times of events to the processing program to\nreduce the volume of data processed this is a simple, but effective, editing method. I\nf\nfurther analysis is required, the engineer may then review his data using the dynamic\nediting mode.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe high cost of processing a large volume of r e s e a r c h data may be cut considerably\nby the proper editing of the data. To accomplish this, editing techniques which are flexible enough to satisfy the varying needs of the r e s e a r c h engineer, while remaining s i m ple in use, must be made available.\nAn editing system has been designed to utilize a general time-sharing computer with\na large Storage capacity. Display devices are accessible through the time-sharing s y s tem, and this capability has made possible the development of two editing techniques. A\nd y k m i c editing method enables the engineer to interact with his data as displayed in a\ntime-plot mode on a digital display device, whereas the static editing technique is designed to produce a microfilm of the data which may be reviewed at the user\'s convenience. The engineer has the choice of selecting the method that best satisfies his requirements f o r successfully editing his data.\nThe static editing technique provides a way of obtaining a fast overview of the data.\nFaulty data and instrument failures can be detected and the t i m e s of preselected events\ncan be determined. A permanent microfilm record of the data is provided for the engineer. The engineer can review these data at his convenience at a number of viewing stations. The microfilm results are fixed, and further interaction with the data requires\ndynamic use of the editing program.\nThe dynamic editing technique allows interaction between the user and his data. The\nlight pen permits the u s e r to dynamically interrogate his data to obtain the time and magnitude. This method is better suited for following up on unexpected events in the data.\nSince there is only a single dynamic display device, editing time must be scheduled in\nadvance.\nA significant reduction in processing costs h a s resulted with the use of these editing\ntechniques. The engineer can select f o r processing only those areas necessary to the\nsolution of his problem. This eliminates the cost of processing redundant or nonessential data. Faulty or questionable data can be located and sufficient information obtained\nto determine the necessary corrective action which should be taken before processing.\nThe processing program may then be instructed to either substitute other useful data for\nthe questionable data, tag or code out the data, or avoid processing data altogether. Reprocessing because of undetected faulty data is then avoided.\n\n6\n\nEditing is also used by the engineer to detect failing instrumentation and then to c o r r e c t the problem before further data are recorded. It is also used in analyzing the noise\ncontent of the data and in selecting processing techniques to minimize the effects of this\nnoise.\nLewis Research Center,\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration,\nCleveland, Ohio, January 7, 1971,\n129-04.\n\n7\n\nAPPENDIX - DISPLAY EDITING COMMANDS\nThe following is a list of the commands available t o the user through the terminal\no r the function keys.
