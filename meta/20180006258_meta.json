Line-of-sight wind speed measurements are generated at each direction and a derivative with respect to distance of the line-of-sight wind speed measurements is calculated at each of the directions. A predicted angular position of a wind event is determined, and the lidar unit may then operate in a fine scan mode in which only a limited sector is scanned. The potential wind event is then quantified utilizing data obtained using the fine scan mode.", "title": "Wind Event Warning System", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2018-10-15T09:23:00.3900000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20180006258, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Koch, Grady J."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "05a65d1af003412a95d8e48060ae239b"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20180006258, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Barnes, Bruce W."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "e47274510fa441708852a7daf8581d5f"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20180006258, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180006258, "id": "c46458b1759b4ce29ef568f3c22668a3", "publicationDate": "2018-09-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180006258.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180006258/downloads/20180006258.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180006258/downloads/20180006258.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180006258/downloads/20180006258.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
