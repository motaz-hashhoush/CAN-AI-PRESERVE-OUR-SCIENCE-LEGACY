The model expresses the relative motion of the cometary fragments in terms of the time of splitting and the differential force, which are determined by measurements of the position angle and the separation distance between fragments. The test is applied to 18 comets suspected of having multiple nuclei, of which the comets Sawerthal 1888 I, Campbell 1914 IV, Whipple-Fedtke-Tevzadze 1943 I, Honda 1955 V, Wild 1968 III and Tago-Sato-Kosaka 1969 IX were found to be clear cases of split comets and Davidson 1889 IV and Periodic Giacobini 1896 V were judged to be likely candidates. At least three of the secondary nuclei confirmed can be classified as short-lived companions, while only two appear to be persistent.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "38", "submissionId": 19790051823, "id": "4035321bc6b8455094d601b862963121", "publicationName": "Icarus", "publicationDate": "1979-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
