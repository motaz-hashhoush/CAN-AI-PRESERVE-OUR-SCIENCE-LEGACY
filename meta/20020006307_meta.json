The two differently manufactured spiral bevel gear types were tested in a closed-loop facility at NASA Glenn Research Center. Strain, vibration, and noise testing were completed at various levels of rotational speed and load. Tests were conducted from static (slow-roll) to 12600 rpm and up to 269 N-m (2380 in.-lb) pinion speed and load conditions. The tests indicated that the maximum stress recorded at the root locations had nearly the same values, however the stress distribution was different from the toe to the heel. Also, the alternating stress measured was higher for the face-milled pinion than that attained for the face-hobbed pinion (larger minimum stress). The noise and vibration results indicated that the levels measured for the face-hobbed components were less than those attained for the face-milled gears tested.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Japan", "submissionId": 20020006307, "endDate": "2001-11-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "Japan"}}, "meetingId": "9f5e4133e8e94b7a948a0afa855ff677", "id": "c114652a1ae74825a5d7241f28ab6d9d"}], "name": "International Conference on Motion and Power Transmission", "location": "Fukuoka", "id": "9f5e4133e8e94b7a948a0afa855ff677", "startDate": "2001-11-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020006307, "id": "619f39d0b242484ab5da64e617985a20", "publicationDate": "2001-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020006307.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020006307/downloads/20020006307.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020006307/downloads/20020006307.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020006307/downloads/20020006307.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
