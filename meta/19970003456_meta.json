These inversion-based techniques have been successfully applied to the endpoint tracking control of multi-joint flexible manipulators and to aircraft control. The specified output trajectory uniquely determines the required input and state trajectories that are found through inversion. These input-state trajectories exactly track the desired output; however, they might not meet acceptable performance requirements. For example, during slewing maneuvers of flexible structures, the structural deformations, which depend on the required state trajectories, may be unacceptably large. Further, the required inputs might cause actuator saturation during an exact tracking maneuver for example, in the flight control of conventional takeoff and landing aircraft. In such situations, a compromise is desired between the tracking requirement and other goals such as reduction of internal vibrations and prevention of actuator saturation; the desired output trajectory needs to be redesigned.", "title": "Optimal Output Trajectory Redesign for Invertible Systems", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T18:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19970003456, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Devasia, Santosh"}, "organization": {"name": "Utah Univ.", "location": "Salt Lake City, UT United States"}}, "id": "bcdb627edfdf4c2282ce7ea569839c51"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19970003456, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19970003456, "id": "abda99b6921947519d8cda046308d589", "publicationName": "Guidance of Nonlinear Nonminimum-Phase Dynamic Systems", "publicationDate": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19970003453, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Guidance of Nonlinear Nonminimum-Phase Dynamic Systems", "stiType": "CONTRACTOR_REPORT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
