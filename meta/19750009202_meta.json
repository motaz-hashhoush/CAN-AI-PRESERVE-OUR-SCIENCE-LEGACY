The radio noise is associated with actively varying sunspot groups accompanied by the S-component of microwave radio emissions. It is shown that the S-component emission in microwave frequencies generally occurs several days before the emission of the noise continuum storms of lower frequencies. It is likely that energetic electrons, 10 to 100 Kev, accelerated in association with the variation of sunspot magnetic fields, are the sources of the radio emissions. A model is considered to explain the relation of burst storms on radio noise. An analysis of the role of energetic electrons on the emissions of both noise continuum and type III burst storms is presented. It is shown that instabilities associated with the electrons and their relation to their own stabilizing effects are important in interpreting both of these storms.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750009202, "id": "2519037e86704397b7f2982e77527a84", "publicationDate": "1974-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19750009202.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19750009202/downloads/19750009202.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19750009202/downloads/19750009202.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19750009202/downloads/19750009202.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
