It was originally developed at NASA Langley Research Center as a way\nto quickly display aircraft configurations described in any one of a variety of geometry definition formats.\nThere are two software sections within CODAC: a hidden-line package, and a user dialog package.\nThe hidden-line package was developed by David R. Hedgley, Jr., of NASA\'s Dryden Flight Research\nFacility [Hedgley,1982]. This package is noteworthy for two reasons. First, it solves the hidden-line\nproblem in the general sense, meaning that the object may be viewed from any angle, with or without\nperspective, resulting in high-quality, publication-grade images. Second, the package performs\nthese functions in a fraction of the time required by other comparable packages. Versions of this\npackage presently exist for Calcomp, Tektronix Plot 10, and Dl-3000 applications.\nThe user dialog package was developed by Computer Sciences Corporation, under contract to NASA\nLangley Research Center. It has two purposes. First, Hedgley\'s hidden-line package is a collection of\nFORTRAN subroutines, not a stand-alone program. The user dialog package functions as its\nexecutive, providing the necessary information, and handling the resulting graphics. Second, the\ndialog package includes many additional features which make creating an image much easier than if a\nsimpler program ran the hidden-line routines.\nThe current version of CODAC executes under CDC NOS 2.4.3 and CDC NOSNE 1.2.1. Both\ninstallations use Precision Visuals\' DI-3000 graphics package. Installing CODAC on other systems is a\nrelatively simple process because it is written in ANSI FORTRAN 7 and all graphics utilities are drawn from\n7\nthe standard 01-3000graphics library (PV1,1984]. A separate document, the "CODAC 1.4 Installation\nGuide", is highly recommended.\n\nList of Features\nQuick, High-Quality images\nFirst and foremost, CODAC was designed to quickly create realistic images of three-dimensional\nobjects. It is relatively fast when compared to similar packages, and produces high-quality,\npublication-grade hardcopies.\nAxis Orlentatlon\nfqather than have the user work with a fixed axis system, CODAC comforms to fit the object\'s axis\nsystem. This makes it easier for the user to visualize the three-dimensional workspace and position\nthe object for the desired view.\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n1-1\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nYaw, Roll, and Pitch\nSimilarly, rather than have the user work with fixed directions of rotation, CODAC accepts the aircraft\ndirections yaw, roll, and pitch. For example, rather than ask for a rotation of -45 degrees around the\nZ-axis, the user asks the object to yaw left 45 degrees. This gives CODAC the name "Cockpit\nOriented", since each rotation is performed as if the user is sitting in the cockpit of the aircraft. In\naddition, any or all rotations may be requested, and in any order.\nAutomatic Scaling\nIf desired, CODAC automatically scales each image it creates to fit on the terminal screen. The user\nmay turn this option off anytime during the interactive session and take manual control.\nGeometry File Formats\nCODAC accepts five geometry file formats: Langley Wireframe Geometry Standard (LaWGS), Craidon\n(1983 LaWGS), Free Vortex Sheet (FVS) Data Check, Hess, and Integrated Aerodynamic Analysis\nSystem (IAAS) General Geometry (GG). Additional formats, such as Hypersonic Arbitrary Body,\nCarlson/HarrisWave Drag, CDS wireframe, and PAN AIR, may be available in future releases.\nAutomatic Formats\nGiven a geometry file, CODAC automatically recognizes any of the formats listed above, and\nprocesses it accordingly.\n\nDI-3000 Metaf Iles\n\nCODAC makes full use of the DI-3000 metafile option, which offers two benefits. First, images written\nonto metafiles are easily transformed into hardcopies on a variety of graphics postprocessing devices.\nSecond, the DI-3000 metafile translator (a utility usually available along with the DI-3000 library) lets the\nuser edit images stored in a metafile. For example, the user may selectively extract images from a\nmetafile, scale or translate them, or even superimpose them on top of other images, then save these\nnew images on a new metafile.\n\nI\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n1-2\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nSection 2\nInteractive Use\n\nFiles\nThe user is responsible for ensuring that the geometry file(s) CODAC uses are available, and that any files\nCODAC writes are retained.\n\nUnder NOS 2 a typical command sequence is:\nGET,F106.\n(CODAC execution)\nSAVE,METAl ,METAP.\n\nmakes geometry file "F106" available\nretains t o metafiles\nw\n\nUnder NOS/VE a typical command sequence is:\nATTF F106\n(CODAC execution)\nCOPF $LOCAL.METAl META1\nCOPF $LOCAL.METAP METAP\n\nmakes geometry file "F106 available\nretains two metafiles\n\nOther operating systems will have different command sequences.\n\nExeciitio n\nCODAC\'s execution sequence depends on its host\'s operating system.\nAt NASNLangley under NOS 2 the commands are:\n\nGET,CODAC/UN=NTFLIB.\nCODAC.\n\nthe first of two menus appears:\n\'Terminal Menu:\n1104.\n4014.\n,4105.\n4107.\n4109.\n41 15.\n\nSieko 1104\nTektronix 4014\nTektronix 4105\nTektronix 4107\nTektronix 4109\nTektronix 41 15\n\nWhich Terminal are You Using ?\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n2- 1\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nFor example, if you are using a Tektronix 4109 terminal, enter 4109; if you are using a Seiko 1104, enter\n1104; and so on.\nThe second menu appears:\n\nI\n\nCapacity Menu:\n100.\n1000.\n\n1400.\n\n100 or fewer panels\n1000 or fewer panels\n1400 or fewer panels\n\nHow Many Panels Does Your Geometry Have ?\nIf your geometry file defines 100 or fewer panels, enter 100. If it defines 1000 or fewer panels, enter\n1000. If it defines 1400 or fewer panels, enter 1400. If you don\'t know how many panels it defines, enter\n1400 (the maximum capacity).\n\nAt NASNLangley under NOSNE the commands are:\n\nSETCL A=$FAMILY.NTFLIB.PROCS\nCODAC\n\nThe first of two menus appears:\n\nI\n\nThe available device drivers are:\nTEK4105\nTEK4107\nTEK4109\nTEK4115\n\nTektronix 4105\nTektronix 4107\nTektronix 4109\nTektronix 41 15\n\nWhich Terminal are You Using ?\n\n1\n\nFor example. if you are using a Tektronix 4109 terminal, enter TEK4109; if you are using a Tektronix\n41 15 terminal, enter TEK4115; and so on.\n\nThe second menu appears:\nThe available panel capacities are:\nSMALL\nMEDIUM\nLARGE\n\n100 or fewer panels\n1,000 or fewer panels\n\n10,000 or fewer panels\n\nHow Many Panels Does Your Geomerty Have ?\nIf your geometry file defines 100 or fewer panels, enter 100 or SMALL. If it defines 1000 or fewer\npanels, enter 1000 or MEDIUM. If it defines 10,000 or fewer panels, enter 10,000 or LARGE.\n\nI\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n2-2\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nWhatever the host operating system, the following welcome banner then appears:\n\nCODAC\nCOCKPIT ORIENTED DISPLAY OF AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATIONS\nVERSION 1.4\n\nJANUARY 1988\n\nNote that the version number and date will change as new versions of CODAC are released.\n\nGeometry File Name and Format\nThe first prompt is:\nENTER THE NAME OF THE FILE CONTAINING YOUR GEOMETRY:\nYou must enter a file name - CODAC cannot use a default file if you only press the RETURN key. The\nname you specify must be valid for the host operating system. If it is not, CODAC wriies an ermr message,\nand asks for another file name. The file also must be available. If it is not, or if the file doesn\'t exist, CODAC\nwrites an error message, and asks for another file name.\n\nAfter a satisfactory file name is entered, CODAC attempts to match its contents with a recognized\ngeometry file format. If a match is made, CODAC names the format used. If the file\'s format is not\nrecognized, CODAC writes an error message and returns back to the previous question asking for a file\nname.\nIf you wish to stop CODAC, enter END, STOP, or QUIT\n\nAxis Orientation\n"Axis Orientation" refers to the three-dimensional environment of the object described in the geometry\nfile. In other words, how are the X, Y, and Z axes arranged relative to the object? CODAC must have this\ninformation before it can correctly manipulate the object. The prompt is:\n\nWHEN IT WAS CREATED, THIS MODEL HAD A SPECIFIC\nXNR AXIS ORIENTATION. AS IF YOU WERE SITTING IN\nTHE COCKPIT, ENTER THE DIRECTION AND AXIS NAME FOR\nTHREE DIRECTIONS: FORWARD, TO THE RIGHT, AND UP.\nFOR EXAMPLE, "-X,+Y ,+Z INDICATES THAT X DECREASES\nMOVING FORWARD, Y INCREASES MOVING TO M E RIGHT,\nAND Z INCREASES MOVING UP.\nTHE MODEL ORIENTATION "-X+Y+Z WILL BE ASSUMED\nIF YOU SIMPLY PRESS THE "RETURN" KEY.\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n2-3\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nFor example, the response:\n\n-x +Y +z\ntells CODAC that "forward corresponds to a negative change in X (\'I-X"), "to the right" corresponds to a\npositive change in Y ("+Y"), and "up" corresponds to a positive change in 2 ("+Z").\nThe response:\n+Y,-z\n\n-x\n\ntells CODAC that "forward corresponds to a positive change in Y ("+Y"), "to the right" corresponds to a\nnegative change in 2 ("Z), "up" corresponds to a negative change in X ("-X).\nand\nThere are some guidelines for entering the orientation. First, all three axes (X, Y, and 2)must be specified.\nSecond, each axis must have a sign (+ or -) preceeding it. Third, the axes in the list can be separated by\nblanks, commas, or no separator at all. For example, the responses:\n\n+z-x-Y\n\n+z,-x, -Y\n+z -x, -Y\n+z,-x-Y\n\n+z-x ,Y\n\nare all valid and all refer to the same orientation.\nIf you wish to stop CODAC, enter END, STOP, or QUIT.\n\nObject Rotation\nThe next prompt is:\nENTER THE YAW, ROLL, AND/OR PITCH ANGLES:\n(IF YOU PRESS ONLY THE "RETURN" KEY\nTHE ANGLES \'YR120 RR20\' WILL BE USED.)\n\nFor example, the response:\nYL45 PU30\n\nasks CODAC to perform a yaw to the left ("YL") 45 degrees, then pitch up ("PU") 30 degrees. Yaw is\nspecified with the prefixes "YL" and "YR", corresponding to "yaw left" and "yaw right", respectively. Roll is\nspecified with the prefixes "RL" and "RR", corresponding to "roll left" and "roll right", respectively. Pitch is\nspecified with the prefixes "PD" and "PU", corresponding to "pitch down" and "pitch up", respectively. For\nexample, the response:\n\nPU15 YR150 RR10\nasks CODAC to perform a "pitch up" of 15 degrees, a "yaw right" of 150 degrees, and a "roll right" of 10\ndegrees. Each rotation request begins with the cockpit facing forward and the viewer directly behind the\nobject .\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n2-4\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nThere are some guidelines for entering the rotations. First, any or all rotations may be entered, and in any\norder. Second, each rotation entered is expected to have its angle of rotation in degrees. Angles less\nthan -360 or greater than +360 are subjected to a modulus function (e.g., "YR380" is converted into\n"YF120"). Third, all rotations in the list are separated by blanks or commas. For example, the responses:\nYL165 PD10 RL30\nYL165, PD10,RL30\nYL165 PDlO,RL30\n\nare all valid and all refer to the same rotations.\n\nIf you wish to stop CODAC, enter END, STOP, or QUIT.\n\nScale Factor, Viewing Distance, and Perspective\nThe next prompt is:\nENTER THE SCALE FACTOR AND VIEWING DISTANCE,\n\nOR ENTER "AUTO FOR AUTOMATIC SCALING WITH\nA SLIGHT PERSPECTIVE.\n(IF YOU PRESS ONLY THE "RETURN KEY THE RESPONSE\n"AUTO WILL BE ASSUMED)\n\nFor example, the response:\nAUTO\n\nselects the automatic scaling option. The image is scaled to fit on your terminal\'s screen and will have a\nslight perspective. Use of the auto-scale option is highly recommended.\nYou also have the option of using a manual scale factor and viewing distance. For example:\n30,99999\nasks for a scale factor of 30 and a viewing distance of 99999.\n\nThe scale factor and viewing distance control the image\'s final appearance. The scale factor sets the\nnumber of object units mapped into each screen unit. Thus a small scale factor produces a large image,\nand a large scale factor produces a small image. The viewing distance controls the amount of perspective\nin the image. A small viewing distance moves the "eye" closer to the object, increasing perspective. A\nlarge viewing distance moves the "eye" away from the object, decreasing perspective. A very large\nviewing distance (like 99999) produces a parallel projection (no perspective).\nThe scale factor and viewing distance operate independently. Image\nfactor. Image perspective is controlled only by the viewing distance.\n\'\n\nis controlled only by the scale\n\nYou may wish to change only orie item of the pair. For example, the response:\n45\n\nsets the scale factor to 45, but leaves the viewing distance unchanged (its previous value is retained).\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n2-5\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nThe response:\n,5000\n\nleaves the scale factor unchanged (its previous value is retained) but sets the viewing distance to 5000. If\nboth items are entered, they are separated by a blank or a comma. For example, the responses:\n45,5000\n45 5000\n45 5000\n45,5000\n\nare all valid and equivalent.\nNote\n\nViewing distance is measured from the object\'s origin (O,O,O). If the yaw/roll/pitch entry\nand viewing distance entry place the vantage point (or "eye") inside, on, or extremely\nclose to the object, CODAC may not draw an image, or may draw a very distorted image.\nIf you wish to stop CODAC, enter END, STOP, or QUIT.\n\nFraming\nThe next prompt is:\nDO YOU WANT THE IMAGE FRAMED?\n(IF YOU PRESS ONLY THE "RETURN" KEY\n\nA FRAME WILL NOT BE DRAWN.)\nIf you press only the RETURN key, or enter N or NO, the next image is not framed with a rectangle. If you\nenter Y or YES, it is framed.\nIf you wish to stop CODAC, enter END, STOP, or QUIT.\n\nAngle Display\nThe next prompt is:\nDO YOU WANT THE ANGLES DISPLAYED ABOVE THE IMAGE?\n(IF YOU PRESS ONLY THE "RETURN KEY\nTHE ANGLES WILL NOT BE DISPLAYED)\nIf you press only the RETURN key, or enter N or NO, the rotation angles will not be displayed. If you enter\nY or YES, they will be displayed.\n\nIf you wish to stop CODAC, enter END, STOP, or QUIT.\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n2-6\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nPlaltting\nlmrriediately after you answer the above question, CODAC clears the screen and draws the requested\nimalge. Depending on the complexity of the object, and on how many other users are sharing your\ncomputer, drawing the image may take less than a minute or up to 10 minutes (for a faster response, try\nusing CODAC early in the morning or during lunchtime, when the system load is generally lower).\nCODAC may pause a number of times before the image is completed. DO NOT request system status\ninformation (escape E under CDC NOS) or change your terminal characteristics while CODAC is drawing\nthe ,action may remove the terminal from graphics mode and fill the terminal screen with gibberish.\n\n-\n\nWhen it is finished drawing an image CODAC activates the crosshaWjoystick cursor. If this cursor interferes\nin seeing the object it can be moved by using the terminal\'s thumbwheels, joystick, or joydisc. Be careful\nto keep the crosshair cursor on the screen (perhaps tucked away in a comer), as positioning it off the\nscreen may confuse the 01-3000 device driver and lead to unpredictable graphic operations.\nUntil you enter the command to continue, CODAC remains suspended. This is the time to make a local\nworking hardcopy, or figure out what changes are needed to obtain a better image. To have CODAC\nresume processing, press the space bar. CODAC immediately clears the terminal screen, and continues\nwith the next series of questions.\n\nMeitaf iles\nA "metafile" is a special file used by the 01-3000\ngraphics package to store one or more graphic images.\nFor a full discussion on metafiles and making hardcopies, see section 4.\n\nThe next prompt is:\nDO YOU WANT THE IMAGE SAVED IN A METAFILE?\n(IF YOU PRESS ONLY THE "RETURN" KEY\n\nTHE IMAGE WILL NOT BE SAVED.)\nIf you press only the RETURN key, or enter N or NO, the preceding image is not saved in a metafile. If you\nenter Y or YES, it is saved in a metafile.\n\nIf you wish to stop CODAC, enter END, STOP, or QUIT.\nIf you answer YES, the next prompt will be:\n\nENTER THE NAME OF THE METAFILE TO BE CREATED:\n(IF YOU PRESS ONLY THE "RETURN KEY\nTHE METAFILE "MF1" WILL BE USED.)\nIf you press only the RETURN key, metafile MF1 is created and the previous image is saved in it. If you\nprovide a file name, it is created and the preceding image is saved in it. If the file name you specify is invalid\nfor the host operating system, or if the file already exists, CODAC writes an error message and asks for\nanother name.\n\nIf YOIJ wish to stop CODAC, enter END, STOP, or QUIT.\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n2-7\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nOnce you save an image in a metafile, subsequent prompts become:\nENTER THE NAME OF THE METAFILE TO BE USED.\n(IF YOU PRESS ONLY THE "RETURN KEY\nTHE METAFILE "mfname" WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED.)\nwhere "mfname" is the name of the metafile currently in use.\nIf you only press the RETURN key, the metafile currently open continues to be used (subsequent images\nare appended to the metafile after the last saved image). Ifyou enter a new file name, the previous metafile\nis closed, a new metafile is opened, and the preceding image is saved in it. If the file name you specify is\ninvalid for the host operating system, or if the file already exists (as a metafile or not), CODAC writes a\nwarning message and asks for another metafile name.\nA multiple image metafile is created\n\nwhen a sequence of images is saved while the same metafile\nremains open and in use. Once you close a metafile, CODAC cannot re-open it and append subsequent\nimages at its end.\n\nDialog Loop\nOnce you complete the metafile prompt(s), CODAC clears the terminal screen and cycles back to the\nobject rotation (yaw/roll/pitch) prompt. A simple diagram of this dialog loop is shown in figure 2-1.\n\nCODAC continues to cycle the dialog loop until you specifically ask to stop. Notice that you may stop\nCODAC at any prompt by entering END, STOP, or QUIT.\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n2-8\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nSection 3\nBatch Use\n\nExecuting CODAC in batch mode is similar to using it interactively, with the following exceptions:\nAll responses to CODAC\'s questions should be contained in the batch jobs command stream. Also,\nyou must include a "QUIT\'\', "STOP, or "END" as the last directive.\n\nFor those questions which accept only a carriage return ("if you press only the RETURN key") a blank\nline (i.e., a line actually containing one or more blanks) in your batch input stream performs the same\nfunction. Note that an empty line or null line may not be the same as a blank line. To be safe, use a\nblank line.\n\nInteractively, CODAC pauses after drawing an image, and you must press the space bar to continue.\nThis does not occur in batch mode. Your batch input stream must not contain any responses between\nyour responses to the question about displaying the rotation angles and the question about wanting\nto save the image on a metafile.\nA sample CDC/NOS batch job to execute CODAC in batch mode is shown as example #1 in Appendix B.\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n3-1\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nSection 4\nMetafile/Hardcopy Postprocessing\n\nConcept of Metafiles\nWhen CODAC draws an image on your terminal screen, two distinct steps are performed. First, the\nDI-3000 library routines create a set of graphics instructions. Second, these instructions are interpreted by\na device driver and the results are displayed on your terminal screen (see figure 4-1).\n\n1\n\nCODAC\n\nGraphics\nInstructions\n\nI\ne\n\nDriver\n\nScreen\nImages\n\nFigure 4-1.\nIn addition to screen images, you may wish to save these graphics instructions for creating high quality\nhardcopies. These instructions can be processed by the metafile driver and written to a metafile (see\nfigure 4-2).\n\nGraphics\ninstructions\n\n-\n\n[\n\nCODAC\n\n1\n\nDl-3000\ne\n\nDevice\nDriver\n\n*\n\nMetafile\nDriver\n\nScreen\nImages\nD 1-3000\n\nMetafiles\n\nFigure 4-2.\nThu!; a metafile is a file containing DI-3000 graphics instructions.\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n4- 1\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nEditing Images\nOnce you have a metafile containing your images, you can use the Metafile Translator to perform any\ndesired editing (see figure 4-3).\n\nMetafile\n\nTrans lato r\nDi-3000\nMetafiles\n\nDevice\nDriver\nMetafile\nDriver\n\nScreen\nImages\nHardcopies\nDI-3000\nMetafiles\n\nFigure 4-3.\nUsing the Metafile Translator, you can perform any of the following functions:\nDisplay all images saved in a metafile.\nDisplay select images from a single metafile or many metafiles.\n- Position and scale images.\n- Create a new metafile and store any sequence of images.\n- Superimpose or otherwise combine many images (even from different metafiles) into a single new\nimage, and optionally store it into a new metafile.\n-\n\n-\n\nFor a full description of the Metafile Translator, including an excellent tutorial, refer to the "Metafile System\nUser\'s Guide" [PV1,1984].\nUnder NOS 2 the Metafile Translator execution sequence is:\nGET, MFE DIT/U N=NTFLI B\nMFEDIT,device\nwhere "device" is the device name of your graphics terminal (4014 for a Tektronix 4014, 512 for an AED\n512, etc.).\nUnder NOSNE the execution sequence is:\n(if not already set)\n\nSETCL $FAMILY .NTFLIB.PROCS\nMFEDIT device\n\nwhere "device" is the device name of your graphics terminal (TEK4105 for a Tektronix 4105, TEK4115\nfor a Tektronix 41 15, etc.).\nFor a detailed discussion of running 01-3000 software under NOSNE, refer to the Software Release\nBulletin, PVI Products, for NOS/VE [CDC,1987].\n\nCODAC 1.4 User\'s Guide\n\n4-2\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nR equest ing Hardco pies\nThe metafiles you create using CODAC can be processed directly by a variety of graphic devices. Users at\nNPiSNLaRC may obtain a list of the available devices and instructions for their use in NASA Technical\nMemorandum 87622 [Taylor,l985]. A sample CDC/NOS batch job to obtain an 11 inch Calcomp hardcopy\nis shown as example #3 in Appendix B. Other installations will have different procedures.\nIf you are using NOSNE you may or may not have plotting devices available. If not, the metafile may have\nto be transferred to an appropriate operating system. For example, NASAlLaRC has no graphic\npostprocessing devices available directly from NOSNE, and all metafiles must be transferred to a\nmainframe running NOS.\n\nCODAC\'s metafiles are 32-bit (high precision) formatted files, permitting them to be transferred across\nmost communication networks.
