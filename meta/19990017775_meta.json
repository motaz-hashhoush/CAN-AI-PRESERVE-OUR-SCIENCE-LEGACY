It is found that the amount of 6 x l0(exp 18) sq cm column NO2 (or even less) given by Sinton as an upper limit for the Martian NO2 content could adequately explain the phenomenon of the blue haze. This finding made it worthwhile to investigate the effect of the temperature and pressure sensitive equilibrium 2 NO2 reversibly yields N204 upon the total NO2 content and the altitude-number density distributions of NO2 and N204. Computations were carried out for surface temperatures of 273 K, 243 K, 213 K, and 183 K and for three different temperature distributions. The discussion of the results leads to the suggestion of several important new experiments.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990017775, "id": "326092db0cce40f68f165398690695fb", "publicationDate": "1963-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990017775.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990017775/downloads/19990017775.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990017775/downloads/19990017775.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990017775/downloads/19990017775.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
