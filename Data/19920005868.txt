b'2-15086\nKBS Demonstration\nB. Aggarwal, A. Artiles, and W. Shapiro\nMechanical Technology, Inc.\nThe demonstration included five different items; the executive program, three\nof the industrial codes, and graphical data display capability using current\nMTI MS-DOS programs. The graphics capability included two- and threedimensional plots viewed from different angles. This capability will be\nported to OS/2 and made an integral part of the KBS executive program.\nThe executive program has a button for each industrial code and facilities to\nprint and browse input and output files generated by the analysis codes. The\nplotting capability will be added in the future. The user can start any of\nthe codes by clicking on the button for the code. The number of codes running\nsimultaneously is limited only by the amount of memory available on the\nmachine. Multitasking capabilities of OS/2 are exploited to perform printing,\nbrowsing and analysis functions in parallel.\nThe three codes demonstrated included Spiral Groove Gas Seals (SPIRAL), Gas\nCylindrical Seals (GCYL) and Incompressible Seals (ICYL). SPIRAL and GCYL\ninterface has the standard PM interface while ICYL interface was designed\nusing ToolBook.\nSPIRAL and GCYL have pull down menus to access input screens. The names of\nthe menu items are the same in both programs. Program options area chosen\nusing radio buttons and check boxes instead of entering numbers. Entry fields\nfor numeric information have built in checks to ensure that the numbers are\nwithin acceptable ranges. Context sensitive help is provided for all input.\nWhen the input is complete, the user may start the analysis by clicking on the\nanalyze button in the menu bar. The output is stored in a use specified\noutput file. The user may also elect to save the input data is a file for\nfuture use.\nInteractive graphics have been used to ease the input process. In SPIRAL, the\nuser can get immediate feedback during analysis grid specification by clicking\non the DRAW button. The program will display the grid as currently specified.\nIn GYCL, the layout of features such as Rayleigh Steps, Recesses, fluid\nsources, etc. on seal pads is done interactively. The components are laid out\non the specified grid using the mouse. This provides a visual representation\nof the seal pad and avoids having to input a large volume of numerical data.\nThis capability will be extended to include variable grid specification.\nICYL interface shows an alternative approach. The menu items are laid out on\nthe screen in the traditional manner. Submenus appear cascaded on the same\nscreen when a menu item is selected by clicking on it. The concept is similar\nto the pulldown menus of the standard PM interface. Direct access is provided\nto any input screen from any other input screen. Menu item names are the same\nas in SPIRAL and GCYL. Program options and numeric data input procedures are\nthe same as in SPIRAL and GCYL. Arrays of numbers are input using scrollable\nentry fields. This capability will be added to SPIRAL and GCYL.\n\n47\n\nSPIRAL-GROOVE CODE\n\nDr. Jed Walowit\n\nStator for Spiral Grooved Face Seal\n\n48\n\nSpiral Grooved Gas Seal Computer Codes\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nShaft seals and face seals\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCompressible flow\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFinite eccentricity and misalignment\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFour degrees of freedom for shaft seals (three for face seals)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFrequency dependent dynamic coefficients\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nArbitrary end pressures\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPredicts load, flow, power loss, dynamic coefficients, shaft\ndisplacements and minimum film thickness\n\nICYL (Incompressible Cylindrical Seals) Code\n\nDr. Antonio Artiles\n\nMTI\n\n49\n\nPROGRAM ICYL\n\nCAPABILITIES\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 2-D incompressible isoviscous flow in\ncylindrical geometry\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rotation of both rotor and housing\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Roughness of both rotor and housing\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Arbitrary film thickness distribution,\nincluding:\n- Steps, pockets, tapers\n- Preloaded arcs\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rotor position and velocity is described\nby four degrees of freedom\n(translational and rotational)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 External forces and moments may be prescribed\nto find rotor position\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Pocket pressurs or orifice size are prescribed\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Laminar or turbulent flow\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cavitation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Inertia pressure drop at inlets to fluid film\n\n- From ends of seal\n- From pressurized pockets\n\n50\n\nComputer Code GCYL\n(Gas Cylindrical Code)\n\nWilbur Shapiro\n\nMTI\n\n51\n\nComputer Code GCYL\n\nThe general capabilities of the GCYL include:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Varying geometries\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Variable or constant grid (30 x 74)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Shaft eccentricity and misalignment\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Specified boundary pressures and periodic\nboundary conditions\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Symmetry in axial direction\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determining load (function of displacement)\nor seal position to satisfy given load\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Choice of English or SI units.\n\nThe output of the program include:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Clearance distribution\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Pressure distribution\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Leakage at specified flow paths\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Load and load angle\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Righting moments\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Viscous dissipation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cross-coupled, frequency-dependent,\nstiffness and damping coefficients\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Plotting routines (pressure and clearance\ndistribution)\n\n52\n\n'
