To\nachieve these objectives, NASA 757 flight test research was conducted at the Eagle-Vail, Colorado airport to\nevaluate three SVS display types (Head-Up Display, Head-Down Size A, Head-Down Size X) and two terrain\ntexture methods (photo-realistic, generic) in comparison to the simulated Baseline Boeing-757 Electronic Attitude\nDirection Indicator and Navigation / Terrain Awareness and Warning System displays. These independent variables\nwere evaluated for situation awareness, path error, and workload while making approaches to Runway 25 and 07\nand during simulated engine-out Cottonwood 2 and KREMM departures. The results of the experiment showed\nsignificantly improved situation awareness, performance, and workload for SVS concepts compared to the Baseline\ndisplays and confirmed the retrofit capability of the Head-Up Display and Size A SVS concepts. The research also\ndemonstrated that the pathway and pursuit guidance used within the SVS concepts achieved required navigation\nperformance (RNP) criteria.\nINTRODUCTION\nLimited visibility is the single most critical factor\naffecting both the safety and capacity of worldwide\naviation operations. In commercial aviation alone, over\n30-percent of all fatal accidents worldwide are\ncategorized as controlled flight into terrain (CFIT),\nwhere a mechanically sound and normally functioning\nairplane is inadvertently flown into the ground, water,\nor an obstacle. The primary causes of these accidents\nare principally due to the lack of outside visual\nreference and lack of situation awareness. The NASA\nAviation Safety Program\xe2\x80\x99s Synthetic Vision Systems\n(SVS) Project is developing technologies with practical\napplications that will eliminate low visibility conditions\nas a causal factor to civil aircraft accidents, as well as\nreplicate the operational benefits of flight operations in\nunlimited ceiling and visibility day conditions,\nregardless of the actual outside weather or lighting\ncondition. The technologies will emphasize the costeffective use of synthetic/enhanced vision displays,\nworldwide navigation, terrain, obstruction, and airport\ndatabases, and Global Positioning System (GPS)derived navigation to eliminate \xe2\x80\x9cvisibility-induced\xe2\x80\x9d\n(lack of vis ibility) errors for all aircraft categories\n(transports, General Aviation, rotorcraft). A major\nthrust of the SVS Project is to develop and demonstrate\n\naffordable, certifiable display configurations which\nprovide intuitive out-the-window terrain and obstacle\ninformation, including guidance information for\nprecision navigation and obstacle/obstruction avoidance\nfor Commercial and Business aircraft.\nThe safety benefit of SVS is projected to be the result\nof an intuitive cockpit display of terrain and obstacles\nthat should help reduce, or even prevent, CFIT, which\nis the single greatest contributing factor to fatal\nworldwide airline and general aviation accidents.1\nOther safety benefits include reduced runway\nincursions and loss-of-control accidents.2 Operational\nbenefits potentially include more approach and\ndeparture options and lower visibility minimums for\nSVS -equipped aircraft.3,4\nBecause intuitive perspective displays can naturally\ndepict effective precision pathway (tunnel) guidance\nconcepts, SVS may also significantly improve flight\npath tracking performance and help meet new FAA\nrequired navigation performance (RNP) criteria. RNP\nis a statement of the navigation performance accuracy\nnecessary for operation within a defined airspace.5\nRNP type is a designator according to navigational\nperformance accuracy in the horizontal plane (lateral\nand longitudinal position fixing). This designator\ninvokes all of the navigation performance requirements\n\n\xe2\x88\x97\n\nAIAA Associate Fellow, Aerospace Technologist\nAerospace Technologist\n\xe2\x80\xa1\nAIAA Member, Aerospace Technologist\n\xc2\xa7\nAIAA Member, Aerospace Technologist\n\xe2\x80\xa0\n\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nThis material is declared a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States.\n\nassociated with the applicable RNP number, which is a\ncontainment value. For example, RNP-1 means that for\nat least 95% of the time the navigational performance in\nthe horizontal plane, or the total horizontal system\nerror, is less than 1.0 nmi. In addition to requiring 95%\npositioning accuracy for RNP operations, these types of\nprocedures also require integrity of the positioning\naccuracy at 99.999% at 2 x RNP number. In our\nexample above with an RNP-1, the position accuracy\nwithin 2.0 nmi of the ownship (2 x RNP value of 1.0\nnmi) would have to be guaranteed to be correct\n99.999% of the time to enable RNP-1 operations.\nThere are three lateral components of navigation error:\npath definition error, path steering error, and position\nestimation error.5\nThese errors, defined in the\nfollowing, represent the total horizontal system error of\nthe airplane and are the difference between the\naircraft\xe2\x80\x99s true position and desired position:\n\xc3\x98\n\nThe path definition error is the difference\nbetween the defined path and the desired path at\na specific point.\n\n\xc3\x98\n\nThe path steering error is the distance from the\nestimated position to the defined path.\nIt\nincludes both the flight technical error (FTE) and\ndisplay error. FTE is the accuracy with which\nthe aircraft is controlled as measured by the\nindicated aircraft position with respect to the\nindicated command or desired position.\n\n\xc3\x98\n\nThe position estimation error, also referred to as\nthe ship\xe2\x80\x99s actual navigation performance (ANP),\nis the difference between the true position and\nthe estimated position.\n\nVertical navigation (VNAV) capability further\nenhances flight operations by enabling the specification\nof a flight path vertically for the lateral flight path.\nVNAV ensures that for at least 99.7% of the time the\nnavigational performance in the vertical plane, or the\ntotal vertical system error, is less than a specified\naltitude deviation measure based on the airspace being\nflown in (below 5000 feet MSL, 5000-10000 feet MSL,\nabove 10000 feet MSL) and the type of flight operation\n(level flight/climb/descent or flight along specified\nvertical profile) being performed (see Table 1).\nThere are four vertical components of navigation error:\naltimetry system error, vertical path steering error,\nvertical path definition error, and horizontal coupling\nerror.5 These errors, defined in the following, represent\nthe total vertical system error of the airplane and are the\ndifference between the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s true vertical position\nand desired vertical position at the true lateral position:\n\xc3\x98\n\nAltimetry system error is the error attributable to\nthe aircraft altimetry installation including\nposition effects resulting from normal aircraft\nflight attitudes.\n\n\xc3\x98\n\nThe vertical path steering error is the distance\nfrom the estimated vertical position to the\ndefined path. It includes both FTE and display\nerror.\n\n\xc3\x98\n\nThe vertical path definition error is the vertical\ndifference between the defined path and the\ndesired path at the estimated lateral position.\n\n\xc3\x98\n\nThe horizontal coupling error is the vertical error\nresulting from horizontal along track position\nestimation error coupling through the desired\npath.\n\nTable 1.

This approach employs existing head\ndown display (HDD) capabilities for glass cockpits\n(i.e., cockpits already equipped with SVS -compatible\nHDDs) and head-up display (HUD) capabilities for\nthe other aircraft. A major NASA flight test at\nDallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and\nseveral simulator studies have occurred for\nassessment and evaluation of the SVS developments\nand the retrofit approach. The HDD objective of\nthese studies was to examine whether an SVS display\ncould be retrofitted into an Electronic Flight\nInstrumentation System (EFIS) Size \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d (e.g., B757-200) Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator\n(EADI) and Size \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d (e.g., B\n-777) Primary Flight\nDisplay (PFD). A Size \xe2\x80\x9cX\xe2\x80\x9d (8 in. x 10 in.) headdown display was also tested that may represent the\ndisplay area available on future aircraft. The HUD\nobjective was to examine the feasibility of retrofitting\nSVS display technology with HUDs for aircraft\nwithout SVS-compatible HDDs. The feasibility of\nretrofitting SVS display technology with HUDs was\nverified for nighttime operations.6 Two terraintexturing techniques were also evaluated during the\nresearch. One method of terrain texturing, generic\ntexturing, involved the selection of terrain color\nbased on absolute altitude. The other method of\nterrain texturing, photo-realistic texturing, employed\nfull-color ortho-rectified aerial photographs draped\nover the elevation model. The results of those studies\nconfirmed that an SVS display, with pilot-selectable\nfield of view (FOV), could be incorporated as part of\nan EFIS suite and effectively replace an EADI or\nPFD. Regardless of HDD display size, and for the\nnighttime HUD application, pilots reported greater\nsituation awareness and had lower FTE while\noperating with the SVS displays compared to\nconventional displays.6 For both HDD and HUD\napplications, no significant performance effects were\nfound between texturing techniques, although most of\nthe pilots preferred the photo-realistic terrain\ntexturing technique to the generic texturing\ntechnique.\nThis research identified the potential of SVS to\nenhance situation awareness and improve aviation\nsafety during approaches to terrain and operationallycomplex airports.6,7,8 The DFW flight test showed\nthat all SVS display concepts provided precise path\ncontrol and significantly improved spatial awareness\nfor approaches under nighttime conditions.\nHowever, although the fixed-based simulator results\n\nhad provided convincing data on the efficacy of SVS\nfor terrain-challenged environments, these results had\nyet to be replicated and validated under operational\nflight test conditions like that conducted at DFW in\n2000. (The 1999 flight test / demonstration of the\nSVS technology did make approaches to the\nAsheville, NC airport, but no empirical data was\ncollected to substantiate the claims that SVS was\neffective in terrain-challenged environments.)\nTherefore, the Aviation Safety program and SVS\nproject conducted a flight test in the vicinity of Eagle\nCounty Regional Airport, CO (FAA identifier: EGE)\nto further examine the utility, capabilities, and\npotential of SVS to enhance situation awareness and\nimprove pilot performance for operations in\nmountainous environments. This paper documents\nthat flight test experiment.\nMETHODOLOGY\nSubjects\nSix evaluation pilots, representing three airlines,\nFAA and Boeing flew 12 research flights totaling\n51.6 flight hours. Eighty-four data flight test runs\nwere conducted to evaluate the NASA display\nconcepts with 49 being flown to EGE Runway 07 and\n35 flown to Runway 25. All participants were rated\nB-757 captains with operating experience at EGE.\nPrior to deployment, all evaluation pilots received a\none-day training course (briefing and simulator\nsession) at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC)\nto familiarize them with the SVS display concepts.\nFlight Test Vehicle and Equipment\nAircraft. The flight test was conducted using the\nNASA LaRC Boeing 757 (B-757) Airborne Research\nIntegrated Experiment System (ARIES) aircraft (see\nFigure 1). The left seat in the Boeing 757 was\noccupied by the Evaluation Pilot (EP). The right seat\nwas occupied by the NASA Safety Pilot (SP). The\nleft seat included the installation of an SVS Research\nDisplay (SVS-RD) and an overhead HUD projection\nunit (see Figure 2). A vision restriction device\n(VRD) (see Figure 3) was placed in the left-seat\nforward windscreen to block the EP\xe2\x80\x99s forward vision\nand thus simulate instrument meteorological\nconditions (IMC) when needed experimentally.\nSVS -RD. The SVS-RD is a Commercial Offthe-Shelf 18.1\xe2\x80\x9d diagonal high brightness Liquid\nCrystal Display monitor, modified for installation\nover the forward instrument panel cluster on the left\nhand side of the ARIES cockpit (see Figure 2). Since\nthe SVS-RD was capable of generating high\nresolution, multi-sized displays, this monitor\n\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ndisplayed all head-down display concepts for\nevaluation. The SVS-RD has 1280 vertical by 1024\nhorizontal pixel resolution (approximately 90 pixels\nper inch) with 900 nits brightness for reasonable\nsunlight readability in the Boeing 757 aircraft.\n\nFigure 1. NASA 757 during EGE approach.\n\nSVS-R D\n\nFigure 2. SVS-RD installed in ARIES 757 aircraft.\n\nFigure 3. VRD in ARIES 757 aircraft.\n\nSynthetic Vision Systems Graphic Engine (SVSGE).\nThe NASA SVS display concepts were\ngenerated by two Intergraph Zx10 personal\ncomputers using Windows NT \xe2\x84\xa2. The Zx10 was a\ndual 866 MHz Pentium III processor with 1+\nGigabytes of Random Access Memory. A video card\nfrom 3D Labs, Inc. - the Wildcat\xe2\x84\xa2 4210 - provided\nSXGA, 1280x1024 at 60 Hz anti-aliased\n(SuperScene\xe2\x84\xa2 enabled) video rendering at real-time\n(>30 Hz) update rates to drive the SVS-RD.\nSymbology was generated using the OpenGL\napplication programming language (API). For the\nHUD raster input, a XGA (1024x768) video output\nfrom the Zx10 was scan converted to RS-343 (875\nline, 30 Hz Interlaced) format video.\nHead-Up Display.\nThe left-seat, overhead\nDassault projection HUD was interfaced with a\nresearch Flight Dynamics Head-Up Guidance System\n(HGS)-4000 computer. The HGS-4000 was modified\nby NASA to conduct research on certain HUD\nconfigurations. The HGS-4000 could be placed in a\n"Normal" mode, which triggered the HGS-4000 to\nfunction with its nominal commercial functionality,\nor in a \xe2\x80\x9cResearch\xe2\x80\x9d mode. For this flight test, the\nHGS-4000 was operated in the \xe2\x80\x9cResearch\xe2\x80\x9d mode,\nwhich triggered the HGS -4000 to include some\nspecial purpose symbology, as described in the\nfollowing.\nThe HGS -4000 computer is stroke-on-raster capable\nusing an RS-343 raster video format input. The\nHGS-4000 raster input consisted of the synthetic\nvision terrain and tunnel symbology while retaining\nhigh-quality stroke symbology for primary flight\ninformation (e.g., airspeed, altitude). The HGS-4000\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrimary Mode\xe2\x80\x9d stroke symbology set was used in\nthe flight test, albeit with the compass rose symbol\nset removed when in \xe2\x80\x9cResearch\xe2\x80\x9d mode. The raster\nimage consisted of \xe2\x80\x9clayers\xe2\x80\x9d of imagery and\nsymbology. Synthetic terrain imagery formed the\n\xe2\x80\x9cBackground Raster\xe2\x80\x9d. Guidance symbology and\ntunnel (\xe2\x80\x9cPathway-in-the-Sky\xe2\x80\x9d) symbology were\ncombined to create the \xe2\x80\x9cForeground Raster\xe2\x80\x9d. The\nFOV of the ARIES HUD was measured to be 22o\nvertical by 28o horizontal. Note that to maintain\nconformality with the outside world, the FOV for the\nHUD raster image was fixed and could not be varied\nby the EP. As the minification/magnification factor\nwas thus unity, the condition was colloquially known\nas unity FOV.\nBrightness and contrast controls were provided: a)\nStroke-only brightness; b) Overall raster image\nbrightness; c) Background raster (synthetic terrain\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nimagery) contrast; d) Background raster brightness;\nand e) Foreground raster (guidance and tunnel\nsymbology) brightness.\nAlthough somewhat\ncomplex, these controls gave the EP the needed\nflexibility to tailor the image.\nA HUD declutter button was available on the control\nyoke.\nThe declutter button cycled the HUD\nsymbology between four modes: 1) No declutter \xe2\x80\x93\nAll display elements present; 2) Foreground raster\n(raster guidance symbology & tunnel) deleted; 3) All\nHUD raster deleted; and, 4) All display elements\n(both stroke and raster) deleted.\nField of View Control. FOV control for the\nNASA HDD SVS concepts was available to the pilot\non a four-position wafer switch on a conveniently\nlocated center console panel. The FOV options were:\nUnity, 30\xc2\xba, 60\xc2\xba, and 90\xc2\xba. The FOV provided at the\n\xe2\x80\x9dunity\xe2\x80\x9d setting changed depending upon the size of\nthe experimental HDD condition being flown.\nEvaluation Tasks\nFMS Runway 25 Approach and Cottonwood-2\nDeparture ("FMS25"). The FMS25 task started on a\ndogleg to the final approach course, level at 13,100 ft\nMSL (see Figure 4). At the waypoint TALIA,\napproximately 16 nm from the airfield \xe2\x80\x93 the final\napproach fix \xe2\x80\x93 the turn to the offset localizer\n\napproach course was made and the descent into the\nEGE local operating area was initiated. The initial\ndescent angle from TALIA was nominally 4.4\ndegrees.\nSeveral descent angle changes were\ncommanded until approximately 1000 ft Above Field\nLevel (AFL), where the guidance directed a 3 degree\ndescent to the runway touchdown zone. A missed\napproach was declared before 200 ft Above Ground\nLevel (AGL) and the NASA SP took over control of\nthe 757 from the EP and performed a level-off and\nreconfigured the aircraft for the departure. The\nmissed approach mimicked the nominal FMS-based\npath (the Cottonwood-2 departure) with a left turn\nwell before the departure end of the runway to ensure\nclearance from Snow Mountain \xe2\x80\x93 an 1800 ft AFL\npeak approximately 2 nm from EGE. After the\ndeparture turn, the EP was given control of the\naircraft and flew the departure task. A reduced climb\nangle departure, loosely replicating the climb of a\nmoderately loaded 757 in a single engine condition,\nwas flown. The simulated single engine departure\nprovided a worse-case operational scenario but a\nbest-case condition for terrain awareness testing. The\nsimulated single-engine Cottonwood-2 departure\nrequired a turn at Waypoint F219G to maintain\nterrain and obstacle clearance along Cottonwood\nPass. The departure concluded upon reaching 10,000\nft Mean Sea Level (MSL), which typically occurred\njust prior to Waypoint F204K.\n\nFigure 4. Approach and departure tasks flown at EGE.\nVisual Arrival to Runway 07 and KREMM\nDeparture ("Visual 07"). The Runway 07 approach\ntask started with the same FMS25 approach\n\nprocedure (see Figure 4). At approximately 5.3 nm\nDME, a level off at 8100 ft MSL was commanded\nfollowed by an approximate 20 degree left turn into a\nmodified downwind leg. When about abeam the\n\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nRunway 07 end, a descending right turn was flown\nfor landing. For this flight test, a go-around was\ndeclared before 200 ft AGL and executed by the\nNASA SP. The SP took over control of the 757 and\nperformed a level-off and reconfigured the aircraft\nfor the departure. A reduced climb angle departure\nwas again established to provide a best-case testing\ncondition.\nThe missed approach procedure\n(following the published KREMM departure\nprocedure) was a left turn to a 050 heading once off\nthe departure end of the runway. After the departure\nturn, the EP was given control of the aircraft and flew\nthe remainder of the departure task. A 050 heading\nwas held until intercepting the 059 radial from the\nSnow VOR beacon. The run ended upon climbing\nalong the 059 radial through 10,000 ft MSL.\n\ncorresponded to different absolute terrain elevation\nlevels. Lower terrain levels were colored with darker\ncolors, while higher terrain levels were assigned\nlighter colors. A shade of green was set to the field\nelevation. The photo-realistic texturing was derived\nfrom full color ortho-rectified aerial photographs.\nThe resulting scene was a highly realistic view due to\nthe photographic imagery employed.\n\nDisplay Conditions\nSix NASA SVS tactical display configurations were\nevaluated in comparison to a simulated Baseline\nBoeing-757 EADI which included a Navigation\nDisplay (ND) with simulated Terrain Awareness and\nWarning System (TAWS) information (see Figure 5).\nThe SVS configurations were obtained by presenting\nSVS terrain databases of two terrain texturing types\n(generic or photo-realistic) on three displays: a HUD\nand two HDD sizes (A or X). The HUD concepts\nutilized the Baseline EADI concept head down, along\nwith the TAWS ND.\n\nFigure 5. Baseline display.\nTerrain Texturing Types.\nTerrain-texturing\nrefers to the method used to fill the polygons that\ncomprise the rendered terrain database. The two\ntexturing concepts tested were elevation-based colorcoding, or generic, and photo-realistic. The generic\ntexturing concept consisted of applying color based\non interpolation between index color bands that\n\nFigure 6. Head-Up Display with generic texturing.\nSVS HUD Concept. As mentioned previously,\nthe NASA SVS Project is investigating the potential\nof HUD technology as a retrofit solution for display\nof terrain database SVS concepts in non-glass\ncockpits. The terrain database scene is presented on\nthe HUD as a raster image with stroke symbology\noverlaid upon it (see Figure 6). It is similar to\nenhanced vision system (EVS) concepts, which\ntypically use advanced imaging sensors to penetrate\nweather phenomena such as darkness, fog, haze, rain,\nand/or snow, and are displayed in the HUD raster\nchannel. However, in the SVS HUD concept, the\nterrain database scene replaces the sensor image. The\nHUD database image is always available to be\ndisplayed and is not compromised by weather\npenetrating capabilities or other sensor anomalies of\nan EVS sensor. Also, unlike EVS displays, the SVS\nHUD concept shows a \xe2\x80\x9cclear sky\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a\nsensor image of the sky, so there is no obstruction of\nthat area of the display. Below the horizon, the raster\nimage may obstruct the view of the outside real world\nin visual meteorological conditions, particularly if the\nraster brightness is not controlled appropriately by\nthe pilot. This possible obstruction was a concern so\ndeclutter control was provided to the pilot and\ntraining was given to mitigate this issue. In addition\nto the raster, nominal flight information symbology\ncharacteristic of most airline HUDs was overlaid on\n\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nthe HUD imagery.\nHDD Tactical Display Sizes. Two different\nSVS-HDD configurations were evaluated during this\nflight test to explore retrofit concepts of SVS display\ntechnology into existing glass cockpits (cockpits\nalready equipped with raster-capable HDDs). One\ndisplay configuration, referred to as the SVS Size A,\nwas similar to a B-757-200 EADI with separate\nairspeed, altitude, and vertical speed gauges, with the\naddition of SVS information (see Figures 7-8). The\n\nsecond HDD configuration, referred to as Size X,\nfeatured an enlargement of an integrated PFD to\nreplicate future SVS HDD concepts (see Figure 9\n10). Evaluation pilots could control the FOV of the\nHDD EADI and PFD concepts evaluated to enhance\ndisplay effectiveness. As mentioned previously, a\nconventional Size A EADI HDD configuration with\nno SVS information was also provided as a baseline\nfor comparison purposes (see Figure 5). Terrain\ninformation was available on the Navigation Display\nfor all of the concepts.\n\nFigure 7. Size A with photo-realistic texturing.\n\nFigure 9. Size X with photo-realistic texturing.\n\nFigure 8. Size A with generic texturing.\n\nFigure 10. Size X with generic texturing.\n\nTunnel and Path Guidance Depiction\nRaw data (path error) information was depicted on\neach display concept by using path deviation\nindicators on the localizer and glideslope scales.\nSVS\n\nDisplays.\n\nA tunnel depiction was\n\nnominally drawn for approach guidance on the SVS\nconcepts (Size A, Size X, HUD) to increase the\npilot\xe2\x80\x99s situational awareness of the desired aircraft\ntrajectory.\nThe objective was to create path\nawareness yet not to obscure or occlude the terrain\nportrayal of the Synthetic Vision image by display\nclutter. With this objective, a \xe2\x80\x9cminimalist\xe2\x80\x9d tunnel\n\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nwas constructed using \xe2\x80\x9ccrow\xe2\x80\x99s feet\xe2\x80\x9d. The crow\xe2\x80\x99s\nfeet were spaced at 0.2 nm along the desired path.\nThe top crow\xe2\x80\x99s feet of the tunnel were only displayed\nup to 1.0 nm in front of the aircraft. The bottom\ncrow\xe2\x80\x99s feet are linearly scaled in brightness so, by 3.0\nnm from own-ship, the brightness of the bottom\ncrow\xe2\x80\x99s feet was reduced to zero.\n\ncondition). The first three runs were always FMS25\nruns to ensure some fuel weight reduction before\nattempting the more challenging Visual 07 runs. The\nSVS Size A and X concept runs, along with SVS\ntexture type variations, were balanced across pilots in\nthe usual manner to alleviate learning and fatigue\neffects.\n\nAdditional guidance information for the SVS display\nconcepts was provided by a ghost airplane symbol.\nThe ghost airplane was positioned by a modified\nform of pursuit guidance to keep the aircraft\ntrajectory tracking the tunnel.9 During the missed\napproach tasks, the tunnel and ghost aircraft were\nremoved and a single cue flight director based on the\nship\xe2\x80\x99s FMS was drawn to provide speed-on-pitch and\nroll steering commands.\nBaseline Display. The Baseline condition had no\ntunnel or ghost airplane guidance symbol, but it did\nhave path deviation indicators on the localizer and\nglideslope deviation scales. Because of difficulties\nencountered with the ship systems\xe2\x80\x99 FMS and flight\ndirector, approach guidance for the Baseline Concept\nvaried according to Task. For the FMS 25 approach\ntask, flight director guidance was provided on\nconventional dual cue flight director needles. For the\nVisual 07 approach task, no flight director guidance\nwas available, and the pilots resorted to the raw\nlateral and vertical path deviation indicators. During\nthe missed approach tasks, a dual cue flight director\nbased on the ship\xe2\x80\x99s FMS was drawn to provide\nspeed-on-pitch and roll steering commands.\nOrganization of Trials\nApproximately 6 evaluations per flight were planned.\nEach evaluation consisted of the approach and\ndeparture task to either Runway 25 ("FMS25") or\nRunway 07 ("Visual 07") (see Figure 11). For\naircraft performance considerations (fuel weight),\nRunway 07 evaluations were planned for the latter\nportions of each flight. Because of the desire to\nensure collection of HUD flight test data, the HUD\nruns were always flown first of all the SVS display\nconcepts.\nThe experimental run matrix was\ndeveloped with these constraints in place.\nGenerally, an EP\xe2\x80\x99s first experimental run used the\nBaseline concept with no VRD installed. In fact,\nwhenever the Baseline condition was evaluated, the\nVRD was not installed. The second experimental run\nused the HUD without the VRD installed. After the\nfirst two experimental runs were flown, the VRD was\ninstalled and used for the remaining display concept\nevaluations (except as noted for the Baseline\n\nFigure 11. NASA 757 during KREMM departure.\nRESULTS\nImproved Path Performance\nDis play/Task Analyses .\nSeparate ANOVAs\nwere performed on the Root Mean Square (RMS)\nlateral path deviation and the RMS vertical path\ndeviation for the entire approach with display type\n(Baseline, Size A, Size X, HUD), task (FMS25,\nVisual 07), and pilot as the independent variables.\nSix runs (4 HUD, 1 Size A and 1 Baseline) were not\nincluded in these analyses due to known data\ncontamination problems (operational restrictions,\nequipment problems, raster guidance symbology\nlimitations, and cockpit distractions). For example,\ntwo HUD runs were excluded due to a low cloud\nceiling of 12,500 feet MSL that prevented the pilot\nfrom flying the required altitude of 13,100 feet MSL\nduring the inbound approach to Waypoint TALIA\n(operational restriction). Another HUD run was\nexcluded due to a pilot\xe2\x80\x99s inability to discern the raster\nguidance symbology from the raster terrain, which\ncaused him to miss the initial descent at Waypoint\nTALIA (symbology limitation).\nDisplay type (F(3,61)=102.143, p<.001) was highly\nsignificant for the measure of RMS lateral path error\nduring the entire approach (see Figure 12). Post hoc\n\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ntests (using SNK with \xce\xb1 = .05), showed that\nsignificantly worse tracking of the lateral path\noccurred when using the Baseline Concept (missing\ndata for FMS25; raw data only for Visual 07:\nmean=818 ft, n=5) as compared to the three SVS\nConcepts, with which the pilots had precision\npathway guidance during each task: Size A (mean =\n61 ft, n=19), Size X (mean=51 ft, n=22), HUD\n(mean=67 ft, n=27). There were no significant\ndifferences among the SVS concepts for this\nmeasure.\nTask, pilot, and the second order\ninteraction of display type and task were not\nsignificant (p>.05) for this measure.\nDisplay type (F(3,65)=18.227, p<.001) was highly\nsignificant for the measure of RMS vertical path error\nduring the entire approach. Post hoc tests (using\nSNK with \xce\xb1 = .05) showed that the vertical path\ndeviation when flying with the Baseline Concept (the\npilots had differing conventional guidance\ninformation across the two tasks: mean=147 ft, n=10)\nwas significantly worse than when flying with any of\nthe three SVS Concepts, with which the pilots had\nprecision pathway guidance: Size A (mean =38 ft,\nn=19), Size X (mean=40 ft, n=22), HUD (mean=32\nft, n=27). There were no significant differences\namong the SVS concepts for this measure. Task,\npilot, and the interaction between display type and\ntask were not significant (p>.05) for this measure.\nApproach RMS Path Error\n900\n\n818\n\nRMS path error (feet)\n\n800\n\nRMS lateral error\n\n700\n\nRMS vertical error\n\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n\n147\n61 38\n\n100\n\n51 40\n\nSize A\n\nSize X\n\n67\n\n32\n\n0\nBaseline\n\nHUD\n\nFigure 12. RMS lateral and vertical path error over\napproach path.\nSVS Display/Texture/Task Analyses . Separate\nANOVAs were performed on the RMS lateral path\ndeviation and the RMS vertical path deviation for the\nentire approach with SVS display type (Size A, Size\nX, HUD), texture type (generic, photo-realistic), task\n(FMS25, Visual 07), and pilot as the independent\nvariables. For the reasons cited previously in the\n\nApproach Path Display/Task Analyses section, six\nruns were excluded from these analyses. Neither the\nmain factors nor the second order interaction between\nSVS display type and texture type was significant\n(p>.05) for the measure of RMS lateral path error\nduring the entire approach.\nSVS display type\n(F(2,56)=8.449, p=.001) and task (F(1,56)=12.884,\np=.001) were significant for the measure of RMS\nvertical path error during the entire approach. Post\nhoc tests (using SNK with \xce\xb1 = .05) showed that the\nvertical path deviation (see Figure 12) when flying\nwith the HUD SVS concept (mean=32 ft, n=27) was\nsignificantly better than when flying with the headdown SVS Concepts: Size A (mean=38 ft, n=19) and\nSize X (mean=40 ft, n=22). The pilots had worse\ntracking of the vertical path during the FMS25\napproach (mean=39 feet) than with the Visual 07\napproach (mean=34 feet). Texture type and the\nsecond order interaction between SVS display type\nand texture type were not significant (p>.05) for the\nmeasure of RMS vertical path error during the entire\napproach.\nRequired Navigation Performance Criteria\nFor the reasons cited previously in the Approach Path\nDisplay/Task Analyses section, six runs were\nexcluded from the Lateral Navigation analyses and\nVertical Navigation analyses described below.\nLateral Navigation Analyses. Lateral path FTE\nhistograms were generated over the entire approach\nfor the four display concepts (Baseline, Size A, Size\nX, HUD). The path steering error component of the\nRNP calculation includes both FTE and display error.\nFor this analysis, it was assumed that display error\nwas negligible, so FTE was the only component of\npath steering error. It was also assumed that the other\ntwo components (path definition error and position\nestimation error) of the RNP calculation would be\nequivalent across the display concepts evaluated.\nWith these assumptions, the SVS concepts yielded a\nhorizontal FTE navigational accuracy of 0.05 nmi at\nleast 95% of the time; while the Baseline concept was\nonly able to yield a horizontal FTE navigational\naccuracy of 0.25 nmi at least 95% of the time. As\nsuch, based on the FTE distributions, the SVS\nconcepts (Size A, Size X, HUD) would enable RNPtype operations that were five times smaller than\nthose that would be allowed with the Baseline EADI\nconcept.\nVertical Navigation Analyses. Vertical path FTE\nhistograms were generated over the entire approach\nfor the four display concepts (Baseline, Size A, Size\n\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nX, HUD). The vertical path steering error component\nof the VNAV performance calculation includes both\nFTE and display error. For this analysis, it was\nassumed that display error was negligible so FTE was\nthe only component of vertical path steering error. It\nwas also assumed that the other three components\n(altimetry system error, vertical path definition error,\nand horizontal coupling error) of the VNAV\nperformance calculation would be equivalent across\nthe display concepts evaluated. In addition, it was\nassumed that the pilot was flying a specified vertical\nprofile so that the required vertical navigation\nperformance accuracy was 300 feet (see Table 1).\nThe HDD SVS concepts (Size A, Size X) yielded a\nvertical FTE navigational accuracy of 150 feet at\nleast 99.7% of the time and the HUD SVS concept\nyielded a vertical FTE navigational accuracy of 100\nfeet at least 99.7% of the time. The Baseline concept\nwas unable to yield a vertical FTE navigational\naccuracy of 300 feet for at least 99.7% of the time.\nAs such, based on the vertical path FTE distributions,\nthe SVS concepts (Size A, Size X, HUD) would\nenable RNP-type operations along a specified vertical\nprofile of 300 feet and the Baseline EADI concept\nwould not. Thus, the SVS concepts enhance flight\noperations by enabling the specification of a flight\npath vertically for the lateral flight path.\nSituation Awareness\nSA-SWORD Ratings. Pilots were asked to\ncomplete a paired-comparison SA-SWORD10 . The\nSA-SWORD for this experiment was designed t\no\nallow a statistical analysis of the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s subjective\nassessment of the situation awareness for each of the\ndisplay configurations (Baseline, Size A Generic,\nSize A Photo-realistic, Size X Generic, Size X Photorealistic, HUD Generic and HUD Photo-realistic).\nFor this exercise, SA was defined as: The pilot\xe2\x80\x99s\nawareness and understanding of all factors that will\ncontribute to the safe flying of their aircraft under\nnormal and non-normal conditions.\nThe responses were averaged and the overall rank\norder was: Size X Photo-realistic, Size X Generic,\nHUD Photo-realistic, Size A Photo-realistic, Size A\nGeneric, HUD Generic, and Baseline. An ANOVA\nwas performed on the mean rankings with display\ntype and pilot as the independent variables. Display\ntype (F(6,18)=6.968, p<.001) was highly significant\nfor this measure. Post hoc tests (using SNK with \xce\xb1 =\n.05) showed that the Size X Photo-realistic had\nsignificantly higher SA-SWORD ratings than all\nother SVS display concepts except for Size X\n\nGeneric. Three dis tinct overlapping subsets were\nformed: 1) Size X Photo-realistic & Size X Generic;\n2) Size X Generic & HUD Photo-realistic; and 3)\nHUD Photo-realistic, Size A Photo-realistic, Size A\nGeneric, HUD Generic, & Baseline.\nPilot Workload Ratings\nPost-run pilot workload ratings revealed differences\namong the display concepts (F(6,73)=5.594, p<.001).\nPost hoc tests (using SNK with \xce\xb1 = .05), showed that\nthe Baseline concept imposed significantly more\nworkload on the pilot as compared to the three SVS\nconcepts: Size A, Size X, and HUD. There were no\nsignificant differences among the SVS concepts for\nthis measure.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe results of this study further confirmed that an\nSVS display, with pilot-selectable FOVs, could be\nincorporated as part of an EFIS suite and effectively\nreplace an EADI or PFD. Regardless of HDD\ndisplay size, and for the daytime, instrument\nmeteorological conditions HUD application, pilots\nreported greater situation awareness and reduced\npilot workload, and had lower flight technical error\n(FTE) while operating with the SVS displays\ncompared to conventional displays. For both HDD\nand HUD applications, no significant performance\neffects were found between texturing techniques.\nIt was hypothesized that the increased path precision\nprovided by the SVS pathway and pursuit guidance\npresentation would enable pilots to make manual\napproaches within RNP accuracies that normally\nrequire RNAV capabilities. The lateral navigation\nanalyses confirmed that flight technical error for all\nthe SVS display concepts achieved an accuracy of\n0.05 nmi for at least 95% of the approach compared\nto just 0.25 nmi for the Baseline condition. The\nvertical navigation analyses paralleled these results in\nthat for at least 99.7% of the time, the Size A and\nSize X concepts achieved a vertical accuracy of 150\nfeet and the HUD concept achieved a vertical\naccuracy of 100 feet which are significantly better\nthan the required vertical accuracy of 300 feet.\nVertical path control with the Baseline EADI concept\n(which met required accuracy 89.0% of time) was\noutside RNP permissible limits. Based on these\nresults, therefore, synthetic vision would enable\nmanual RNP operations that are five times smaller\nfor lateral RNP and within required vertical\nperformance accuracy values than similar operations\nwith current 757 instruments. The outcome would be\n\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nan increase of RNP operations to runways that\notherwise would not meet current Minimum Aviation\nSystem Performance Standards (MASPS), resulting\nin a significant economic advantage to airlines\nemploying SVS technology.3,4\nThe NASA Synthetic Vision Eagle-Vail flight test\nprovided valuable research data that have enabled\nsignificant improvements to be made to the SVS\ndisplay concepts. To date, several findings of the\nflight test have been incorporated into current\nsynthetic vision displays. For example, several pilots\nsuggested that photo-realistic and generic texturing\nshould be combined together to achieve the best that\neach method has to offer, and a new hybrid texture\nhas been developed that helps achieve this. Other\nchanges include development of several new tunnel\nconcepts and modifications to the HUD to use stroke\nsymbology to better discriminate against raster\nterrain imagery, particularly, the implementation of a\nstroke tunnel depiction. NASA researchers have\nbeen focused on developing new synthetic vision\nconcepts, such as SVS navigation displays. These\nare part of a suite of R&D activities that form the\nfuture directions that are being taken to help ensure a\n\xe2\x80\x9chuman-centered\xe2\x80\x9d synthetic vision system.\nA flight test evaluation is anticipated in 2003 by the\nNASA/Langley Research Center (NASA/LaRC)\nunder NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Aviation Safety, Synthetic Vision\nSystem Project to examine a synthetic vision system\nthat integrates the enabling technologies (Runway\nIncursion Prevention System, SV-Sensors, and\nDatabase Integrity Monitoring Equipment) of SVS.\nThe research will focus on the integration of runway\nincursion prevention technologies, surface map\ndisplays, integrity monitoring, enhanced vision\nsensors, SVS navigation displays, and enhanced\nsynthetic vision primary flight and HUD displays.\nTogether, such a synthetic vision system may\nconsiderably help meet national aeronautic goals to\n\xe2\x80\x9creduce the fatal accident rate by a factor of 5\xe2\x80\x9d and to\n\xe2\x80\x9cdouble the capacity of the aviation system\xe2\x80\x9d, both\nwith 10 years.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\n3.\n\nHemm, R.V.
