The AEMS provides\ncomputer-driven cockpit displays that indicate when to manually set the flaps, ge,ir, and\nthrottles to follow an optimized deceleration profile and consistently stabilize the final\napproach at a predetermined target speed and altitude. Operational implementation would\nrequire airplane retrofit and installation of DME ground stations collocated with VASI or \t\nILS glide slopes.\nThe technical feasibility and potential benefits of the concept were evaluated during a\nBoeing engineering and piloted simulation study, reported separately. Since the concept\nappeared promising, the work was extended to include estimation of operational implementation costs, reported herein.\nBudgetary costs in 1976 dollars for retrofit of a typical 727-200 configuration were estimated by Boeing with avionic vendor participation, for three market bases (100, 300, 500\nshipsets). For a market base of 300 shipsets, the initial implementation cost was estimated\nto be $66 000 per airplane, which includes purchase of a master change (MC) retrofit kit\n($56 000), installation by the customer (256 man-hours), and other one-time costs such as\nspares and maintenance training. Airplane down time could be minimized by accomplishing\nthe installation (5 calendar days) concurrent with other scheduled layups (e.g., "C" check)\nand is not included in the cost estimate. A cost-benefits analysis indicates the estimated\nfuel savings would provide a 33% to 38% rate of return on investment which would pay\nback the investment costs in less than 3 years. In addition to conserving about 0.19m\n(50 U.S. gal.) of fuel per approach (still air, VFR conditions) the AEMS has potential for\nsubstantially reducing approach time and noise.\nNo additional ILS or VASI facilities are necessary to meet the NASA study objective of\nusing the AEMS on 50% of all 727 approaches, However, additional colocated DME stations\nare required, the number depending on the runway distribution criteria used. A DME cost of\n$5 million appears representative for a Distribution placing high priority on noise abatement.\nTo equip all existing ILS runways with collocated DME at all 727 airports would cost $12\nmillion. These DME costs are relatively small compared to the cost of airline fleet retrofit.\nBoeing studies were conducted to provide scoping level information as part of a NASA-ARC\nresearch program. There is no commercial program in progress for AEMS implementation.\nAdditional studies with airline and FAA participation would be required to further develop\nthe technical aspects of the concept and to evaluate operational feasibility before considering airline fleet retrofit.\n\n....\n\n2.0 INTRODUCTION\nThis cost study was conducted as part of a NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) program to\ndevelop and evaluate an approach energy management system (AEMS) and associated delayed\nflap approach (DFA) procedures for commercial jet transports. The NASA delayed flap\napproach procedures are an extension of the noise abatement approach techniques used by\nAir Transport Association (ATA) member airlines (ATA memo 72-90). These procedures\nreduce approach time, fuel, and noise by retaining a low drag configuration for as long as \t\npractical and by using the minimum landing flap setting where possible. The AEMS increases\nthe benefits of the procedures by providing computer-driven cockpit displays to assist the\npilot in the following optimized speed, thrust, and configuration schedules. Implementation\nof the AEMS would require aircraft retrofit and installation of distance measuring equipment (DME) ground stations collocated with the visual approach slope indicator (VAST)\nor instrument landing system glide slope.\n\n!^,\n\nThe AEMS concept was initially developed and flight tested by NASA ARC on the CV-990.\nBoeing began an engineering and piloted simulation study in July 1975 (contract NAS28953) to adapt the NASA concept to the 727, determine the potential benefits, evaluate\nsystems compatibility and pilot workload, and provide a preliminary avionic specification.\nThe results showed that the concept has potential for substantially reducing approach time,\nfuel consumption, and noise with a moderate increase in aircrew workload. These studies are\ndiscussed in reference 1, and the resulting avionic configuration is specified in reference 2.\nAfter reviewing the engineering and simulation study results, NASA-ARC continued the\ninvestigations to obtain additional information necessary for judging operational acceptability. Since an important operational consideration is the cost of the equipment, the\nBoeing study was extended to estimate implementation costs for (1) AEMS avionic development, and 727 fleet retrofit, and (2) DME ground station installation.\nThe intent of the cost study is to provide scoping level cost data for consideration by the\nNASA Research and Technology Advisory Council in deciding if further NASA research in\nthis area, possibly including prototype hardware development and flight test, is warranted.\nIt should not be inferred that a commercial retrofit program could be initiated at this time.\nAdditional work to improve the concept and establish operational feasibility would be\nrequired before considering fleet retrofit.\nThe extent of the additional work necessary to further develop the AEMS and demonstrate\noperational acceptability and the degree of government involvement in such a program has\nnot been determined. In addition to the technical and economic aspects which have been\ninvestigated, there are several other operational concerns such as:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n2\n\nWill the required DME ground stations be installed?\t\nCan air traffic control (ATC) accommodate the higher initial approach speeds (220 kn)?\n\nr\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAre the procedures safe and acceptable to airline pilots?\n\n0\t\n\nWould the noise benefits be allowed in showing compliance with noise restrictions?\n\nIt would be difficult for an individual airline and/or airframe manufacturer to resolve these\nquestions. For this implementation cost study, it was assumed that all work necessary to\nestablish operational feasibility would be completed under NASA-funded research programs\nbefore beginning hardware implementation. This work would include further conceptual\ndevelopment, simulator evaluations to determine airline pilot acceptance, ATC compatibility studies, safety analyses, and update of the AEMS equipment specification as required to\ndefine an operationally acceptable configuration. This study considers only the costs for\ncommercial implementation of a concept that has been fully developed and evaluated by\nNASA.\nThe preliminary 727 AEMS avionic specification (ref. 2), resulting from \',e initial Boeing\nengineering and simulator studies, was used as a basis for estimating implementation costs.\nSince the AEMS is advisory in nature, only a single-channel installation is specified. However,\nthe specification requires high reliability and adequaie failure detection.\nAlthough the specification was considered to be final for purposes of the cost study, some\nrevisions should be expected prior to releaa ng a specification for prototype hardware. A\nmajority of the revisions would be in the digital computer program logic which should not\nappreciably affect the equipment costs, However, some additional avionic and airplane\ninstallation hardware may also be required: e.g,,\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nA free air temperature input may be necessary to adjust the profile prediction for nonstandard conditions, (Boeing studies to date have been limited to standard days only.)\nAdditional avionics to provide independent monitoring of speed margins relative to\nflight safety limits may be desirable.\n\nNo allowances have been made in the cost estimates for these or any other components not\nincluded in the current specification.\nThe estimated prototype program costs through type certification, but excluding airline\npilot flight dr.monstrations, were identified separately as requested by NASA. Recovery of\nthe prototype program costs is included in the total retrofit kit price estimates.\nA comprehensive NASA-commercial program for 727 AEMS development and implement. ation has not been established, since the concept is in research and feasibility study status.\nTo provide a basis for distinguishing NASA study costs from equipment implementation\ncosts, the following program was assumed:\n\napp\nt\n\n4" .PA\nAzloi\n3\n\ns,\n\nr\n\nProgram phase\t\n\nSource of funding\n\nFeasibility studiesa\tNASA\nIncluded in kit price\nPrototype development and\t\ncertification\n3. \' Flight demunstrationsa\tNASA\n4.

Equipment operation,\nflight profiles, estimated benefits (time/fuel/noise), and other results of the Boeing engineering and piloted simulator study program (ref. 1) are summarized in appendix A for convenience. Other possible applications for the AEMS equipment and an alternate independent\nspeed monitor concept are discussed in section 4.3 for future consideration, if the AEMS is \t\nfurther developed.\n\n-\xe2\x80\x9e\n\n4.1 CONCEPT\nThe delayed flap approach is an operational procedure that could be used with existing\nVASI or ILS glide slopes (one segment) to reduce approach time, fuel, and noise. As indicated in figure 1, the approach is initiated from a low drag configuration at a higher-thannormal initial approach speed; e.g., clean, 220 kn. Gear and flaps are extended by the pilot\nat distances computed on board by the AEMS while decelerating at reduced power to the\nfinal approach speed. The final approach is stabilized in the landing configuration at a target\nspeed and altitude above 152m (500 ft) selected by the pilot. The deceleration phase of\nthe approach is flown with throttles fixed--essentially at idle. Drag management rather than\nthrottle modulation is used to control energy to arrive at the selected stabilization altitude\nat the proper speed. Otherwise, the airplane is controlled in the normal manner.\nThe AEMS employs a digital computer and computer-driven cockpit displays to assist the\npilot in following an optimized flight profile (which is adjusted for variations in wind,\nweight, and other operational variables) and in consistently stabilizing at a minimum practical target altitude. The system can be used during either manual or autopilot coupled\napproaches, under visual flight rule (VFR) or instrument flight rule (IFR) conditions, and\ndoes not involve any modifications to the existing flight control systems. The AEMS is\nstrictly an advisory system that can be used, ignored, or turned off at the discretion of the\npilot.\n4.2 EQUIPMENT\nThe 727 AEMS configuration as specified by reference 2, whi, h was used as a basis for this\ncost study, includes the following avionics;\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAirborne digital computer and interface equipment\nIt\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Control panel\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAnnunciator panel\t\n\nThe AEMS concept also requires a fast/slow indicator on the ADI, which would require an\nADI modification for about 80% of the 727 fleet.

The proposed locations for the cockpit displays and the physical\narrangements of the control panel and annunciator panel are shown in figures 3 through 5.\nThese locations and arrangements are as defined in the preliminary avionic specification\n(ref. 2). The final configuration for an airline installation could be tailored to meet individual airline requirements.\n4.3 OTHER POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS\nThe AEMS concept requires installation of:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAn airborne digital computer\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nA cockpit control panel including a digital input keyboard\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nCockpit displays showing the proper settings for throttles, (EPR), flaps, and gear\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nA fast/slow indication of energy\n\nIf the concept is further developed, it is expected that an independent speed monitor,\nprobably based on angle of attack, would also be incorporated. In this case, the fast/slow\nindicator on the attitude director indicator (ADI) might be used as the independent speed\nmonitor with the energy monitor(s) combined with the annunciator panel, as indicated in\nfigure 6, or installed separately; e,g., adjacent to airspeed indicators.\nThe AEMS is utilized only during terminal area descent and approach, so the equipment is\navailable for other functions during other flight phases such as:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Takeoff Noise Abatement--Use of the computer, displays, and DME range information\nto assist the pilot in minimizing takeoff noise.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nEngine Limits\xe2\x80\x94Systems to compute and display maximum power settings are currently\nin service on some Boeing aircraft (TAT/EPRL computer).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Performance Optimization\xe2\x80\x94Computation and display of optimum climb and cruise\nconditions and other performance information to minimize fuel consumption.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wind Shear Detection--The AEMS, using DME ground speed, continuously computes\nwind velocity during approach, which could be used for shear detection logic and \t\nimplementation of cockpit warning,\n\n10\n3\nk\n\nIt\n\nAnnunciator\t\npanel\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Throttle ( No, l) position\ntransducer (now sensor)\t\n\n1\t\n\n.^,.\n\nControl\npanel\n\nFast/slow\nin ADI\n\n_\nQ\n-\n\nDigital\ncomputer\nand\nInterface\nequipment\n3/8\xe2\x80\xa2ATR-long\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Outboard flap position\nLanding gear handle position\n0 Engine anti-ice switch position\n0 DME receiver\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Range\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Range rate\n0 Off flag\nCADC, airspeed\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Altimeter (baro\xe2\x80\xa2corrected altitude)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cabin pressure controller\n(landing field elevation set)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Flight director go-around mode select\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nExisting fast/slow\ncommands\n\nShip\'s power\n\nFigure 2.-727 AEMS Schematic\n\nI1\nEa\n\n0-\n\nt4\n\nAnnunicator panel\nFast slow indicator on ADI\n\nFirst Officer\'s\n\t\nPilots\' FWD radio and radar\n\nFigure 3-727 AEMS Cockpit Displays\n\nControl panel\n\n\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI!\t\n\nf\n\nDigital Display\n\nIL\n1:1 is C3i0\n%O Q s\n\nIDLE\n\n1.1\nAPP\n\nEPH\n\nf\n\n06-\n\n0\n2\n5\n\nGEAR\n\t\nFLAPS\n\nG ri\n\n15\n25\n30\n\niNOP\nPUSH TO RESET\n\nShown\nfull\nScale\n\nNote; This configuration\nused for cost study\n\nFigure 4.\xe2\x80\x94Annunciator Parcel\n\n13 L09\nu\n\nVFINAL\n\nu\n\nFIELD EL\n\nVFiEF 30\t\nWEIGHT\t\n\nu\n\no\t\n\nH MIN\nG/S ANGLE\n\nTEST\t\nOFF\n\nD D C1\n\nFigure 5.\xe2\x80\x94Control Panel\n\n13\n\nOther applications for the AEMS computer, displays, and DME ground station have been\nsuggested, but some of these (e.g., performance monitoring during takeoff roll, energy\nmanagement for a two-engine-out landing) might have safety-of-flight implications that\nwould alter the current HEMS design philosophy (advisory system only).\nThese potential applications have much in common.

Major emphasis was to determine\nthe initial costs for AEMS implementation including prototype hardware development, certification, and airline fleet installation. These implementation costs were estimated by the\nBoeing 707/727/737 Division with avionic vendor participation. Estimating procedures were\nsimilar to those used in preparing budgetary estimates for an MC retrofit kit in response to\nan airline request. After the implementation costs had been determined, a brief cost of\nownership study was conducted by the Product Assurance Engineering and New Technology\nPricing; groups. In addition to the implementation costs, this study included other cost considerations such as training, maintenance, spares, tax credits, and the return on the equipment investment resulting from fuel savings.\n\n.*1.\n\nNote: There is no Boeing commercial program in progress for AEMS implementation. The\ncost data in this report are intended for use as part of a NASA R&D study to provide\nscoping-type information con-.erning system costs versus benefits and should not be interpreted as an offer to manufacture or install the equipment.\n5.1 INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION COST STUDY\n5.1.1 COST DATA\n\nEstimated costs for implementing the currently defined AEMS (ref. 2) in the 727-200 are\npresented in figure 7. The price curve shown is for a Boeing-supplied MC kit, which includes\nthe vendor-supplied avionics and other components as listed in table 1. Since the potential\nmarket for the AEMS has not been determined, the kit price is presented as a function of\nvarying market base. The kit prices are expressed in 1976 dollars. The man-hours and\ncalendar time estimated for customer airline installation of the kit are noted in figure 7\nbut are not included in the kit price curve.\nPrototype development and type certification price of $2.2 million are identified as a lump\nsum as requested by NASA. The MC kit prices in figure 7 include recovery of the prototype\nprogram price as well as all other nonrecurring; and recurring costs of the kits.\nCost data for the vendor-supplied avionics were obtained by requesting several avionic\nvendors to provide budgetary cost estimates based on the preliminary AEMS avionic specification (ref. 2). Five vendors responded with estimates for development and delivery of two\nprototype units to Boeing, including support of simulator and flight testing and for subsequent avionic production, Representative vendor estimates for the avionics are included in\nthe Boeing estimates (fig. 7) for the prototype program and MC kits.\n\nI5\n\nBO\n\n60\n\nShipset\nprice,\t\n$1000\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n100\t\n\nJuu\t\nMarket base, shipsets\n\nNote:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Includes recovery of prototype program price ($2.2 million)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Customer installation time (256 man hours, 5 days)\nnot included\n\xe2\x80\xa2 1976 dollars\n\nFigure Z--727 AEMS Retrofit Kit Price, Planning Estimate\n\n16\n\nou0\n\nTable 1.-727 AEMS Retrofit Kit Components\nDigital computer and interface equipmenta\nControl panel\nAnnunciator panel componentsa\nModified instrument panels (formed sheet metal only; i.e., no instruments)\nFast/slow installation kit for ADl\nParts kits to modify two DME interrogators for ARINC 668 outputs\nThrottle position transducera\nThrottle cable quadrant and cables\nLanding gear lever position switch\nEngine inlet anti-ice switch\nAEMS wire bundles\nMiscellaneous wire stock and circuit breakers\nElectronic equipment shelf modification parts\nDocumentation for customer installation, operation, and support\naSupplied by AEMS Avionic vendors,\n\n}\t\n\n5.1.2 DISCUSSION OF PROTOTYPE PROGRAM COSTS\n\nk\t\n\nThe prototype program provides for hardware implementation and FAA certification of the\n727 AEMS concept as currently defined by reference 2.

Hence, the engineering estimates reflect only detailed design costs and do not include\nany exploratory development or simulator evaluations to establish feasibility.\nFlight test costs am based on the use of a new factory airplane to be modified by Boeing\nflight test operations. The airplane would be used for the AEMS test and then returned to\nthe normal production configuration prior to delivery to the customer. This approach was\nselected because Boeing at present has no suitable 727-200 flight test airplane, and it would\ncost more to use an operational aircraft leased from the owner; e.g., the inspections required\nto establish conformity to specifications would already be accomplished on the factory\nairplane at no cost to the AEMS program.\nThe prototype program emphasizes simulator testing rather than flight testing of the AEMS\nhardware in order to minimize costs. Computer logic and cockpit display operation should\nbe completely checked on the simulator before making the first flight. As currently envisioned, the only requirement for engineering flight testing of the AEMS is to adjust the\nthrust and drag models in the airborne computer, if necessary, to match the actual airplane\nand to confirm proper equipment operation in flight. Type certification tests would be flown\n\n18\n\nR\n\nr\'\nI\n\n0\n\non the same airplane immediately following the engineering flight test program. Tile prototype avionics, "red-labeled" to identify any modifications incorporated during the flight\ntest program, would be used for the type certification testing.\n5.1 .3 DISCUSSION OF FLEET RETROFIT COSTS\nCosts for 727-200 fleet retrofit were estimated using one typical airline customer configuration as a baseline for determining the MC kit price and customer installation costs. The\n1k vendor-supplied avionics were assumed to be identical for all customers. Therefore, it should\nbe noted that the current AEMS computer program applies only to the 727-200 with\nJT8D-9 engines, Additional costs, including first of model certification for each airframe/\nengine combination, would be incurred in adapting the AEMS for use on airplanes equipped\nwith other engines or with engine intermix. These costs have not been included in figure 7.\nA majority of the avionic design work and part of the airplane installation design would be\naccomplished during the prototype program. The engineering necessary to provide suitable\nairplane sense, inputs to the AEMS (e.g., new throttle position transducer, sensor interface\nisolation to prevent failure propogation, etc.) are included in the prototype program.\nAdditional engineering and customer support man-hours will be required following prototype certification to implement the AEMS into airline fleet service. These production\nengineering and support costs along with manufacturing and acceptance test costs are included in the curves of retrofit kit price.\nRetrofit kit program costs common to all 727-200/JT8D-9 customer configurations include;\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAvionic production (engineering, tooling, manufacturing, and manuals)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAvionic qualification and bench testing\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nComputer production software\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nCommon installation components (cable assemblies for throttle position transducer,\nelectrical wires, etc.)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Design support and documentation of common components\nPlanning estimates are shown in figure 7 for market bases to 500 shipsets. Because of the\nnumerous airframe/engine combinations and customer configuration variables involved it\nshould be recognized that few components other than the avionics hardware would be the\nsame for all kits. There would be minor variations in the computer software to account for\nairframe/engine model differences, and the AEMS cockpit display packaging may vary\ndepending on customer preferences. In addition to variations in the AEMS avionics, much of\nthe Boeing work necessary to supply a retrofit kit is applicable only to one customer configuration. This includes:\n\ni\n19\n\nr^\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI \t I\t\n\nI\t I\t T\t f\'\ni\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nFlight deck rework design and parts\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nElectronic equipment shelf rework design and parts\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nDesign of wire routing and interface with ADI and air data systems\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nRevision of customer manuals (operations, training, maintenance, and wiring diagram)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nService bulletin preparation\n\ns\n\nThe estimated man-hours and calendar time required for customer installation of the retrofit\nkit include ground functional checkout of the AEMS but do not include defueling or normal\npreflight and/or postflight inspections of the airplane. The installation could be made concurrent with other scheduled maintenance layups to minimize airplane down time.\n5.1.4 TECHNICAL WORK DESCRIPTION\nImplementation of the AEMS requires several airplane modifications to install the avionics\nand provide the necessary sensor inputs. To establish a good basis for estimating retrofit\ncosts, engineering work statements were prepared by the appropriate 727 project groups to\ndefine the AEMS retrofit kit and kit installation requirements. One typical customer airline\nconfiguration, requiring a representative amount of rework, was selected for study. A general\ndescription of the installation corresponding to the cost estimates is presented in the following paragraphs.\nFigure 8 shows the relative locations of the various AEMS components and inputs located in\ntwo general areas: the electronic bay and the cockpit.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Electronic Bay\xe2\x80\x94The AEMS computer and interface equipment, including a power\nsupply module, are packaged in a 3/8-ATR-long box which is installed on a reworked\nelectrical equipment shelf. The central air data computer (CADC) and the DME receivers, which provide inputs to the AEMS computer, are also located in this area.\nAlthough the flap position transmitter is located in the wing, the AEMS wiring can be\nspliced into existing wire runs to the flap position indicator in the cockpit.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cockpit\xe2\x80\x94The AEMS annunciator panel, control panel, fast/slow indicator, and throttle\nposition transducer are installed in the cockpit area, where the other required sensors\nand switches are also located.\nThe throttle position transducer is a completely new installation which requires installing\na throttle cable quadrant and two new cable assemblies (replacing one existing cable assembly) in addition to the transducer and wiring. The Ianding gear lever switch is a new switch\nthat provides a logic signal (ground) to the AEMS computer when the gear lever is placed in\nthe down position. The engine inlet anti-ice logic signal (ground) is provided by adding an\n\nP.\n\n20\n\nA\n\nA\t\n\n.^\t\nit\t\n\nit\n\n0\nb\n\no\n57 1\n\nEngine anti- ice switch\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nField elevation seta\n\nIM\nFlap position transmitter\n\nDigital computer b\nInterface equipment b\n\nCADC, airspeed\nDME receiver\n\nFlight director mode select (go-around)\n\nThrottle position transducer b\n\nControl panel b\nAnnunciator panel b\n\nFast/slow indicator\n\nClear lever position switch\nBarometric altimeter\n\na Not available on some 727 models.\nb Supplied by AEMS vendor.\n\nN\n\nFigure 8,-727 AEMS Installation\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nf\t\n\ni .I\t\n\nf\n\nadditional contact to an existing switch, The flight director go-around mode logic signal is\nprovided from an existing switch. This signal returns the AEMS computer to standby status\nwhen a go-around is initiated.\nThe field elevation input from the electronic cabin pressure controller is used by the AEMS\nas a default value which the pilot can replace through the AEMS control panel if he so\nchooses. While useful in reducing pilot workload, this input may not be essential. Since\nmany 727 air: s aft are equipped with a pneumatic rather than electronic cabin pressure\ncontroller, deletion of the requirement for this input should be considered if the AEMS is \t\nfurther developed.\nThe airspeed synchro signal and a CADC-valid signal are available from the CADC. Barocorrected altitude signals (fine and course synchro) are obtained from the captain\'s altimeter.\nThe existing DME interrogators (two per airplane) are of the ARINC 52ID type for the\nparticular 727 customer configuration selected as a baseline for preparing the work statements. It was assumed these would be modified by the customer to provide the ARINC 568\nrange (pulse pair) and range rate required for AEMS operation. The DME-valid signal is available without modification. The technical concepts for obtaining and processing the DME\ninformation should be carefully reviewed, including consideration of serial word (ARINC\n561) transfer, if the AEMS is further developed. However, the approach used in this study\nshould provide representative cost data.\nThere is no fast/slow indicator on the ADI installed in the particular 727 airplane selected\nfor this study. However, the manufacturer has a kit for modifying the existing ADI, so it\nwould not be necessary for the customer to purchase a new instrument. Since a fast/slow\nindicator is already installed on some customer configurations, provisions for switching the\nfast/slow signal source are incorporated within the AEMS. Modification of the existing fast/\nslow wiring on airplanes so equipped would be required to bring the existing signal into the\nAEMS computer. Installation of the AEMS control and annunciator panels requires rework\nin the flight deck area. For the customer configuration selected for this study, it would be\nnecessary to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nInstall modified ADI\'s\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nRelocate the ATC controller from the pilots\' forward electronic panel to the pilots\'\noverhead panel\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nInstall the AEMS control panel in the space vacated by the ATC controller\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Install the annunciator panel components: light plate, incandescent numeric displays,\nand annunciator lights. (These would be installed individually rather than being incorporated in a single box.)\nElectrical power for lighting the AEMS control and annunciator panels is available from\nexisting 0- to 5-Vac cockpit lighting circuits. Input power (115-Vac, four-wire, three-phase\nship\'s power) to the AEMS computer power supply is available in the electronic bay. The\n\n22\n\n4\t\n\nr.,\n\nE\n\nAEMS computer receives inputs from the AEMS control panel and from all other sensors\nand switches, including the reset switch on the annunciator panel. Outputs from the computer must be provided to the annunciator panel, the digital readout on the control panel,\nand the fast/slow indicator. Electrical equipment shelf wiring must be revised and additional\nwires added to connect the various components. About 20 existing wire bundles are affected.\nlo,\nInstallation details would vary between customer configurations. However, these types of\nmodifications are typical.\n5.1.5 COST STUDY GROUND RULES\nThe implementation cost estimates were based on the following ground rules:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nKit Prices---Prices are to be in 1976 dollar budget estimates presented as a function of\nmarket base (100, 300, and 500 shipsets).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nPrototype Program\xe2\x80\x94For NASA planning purposes, the prototype program costs included in the kit price are to be identified as a lump sum.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Airplane Configuration\xe2\x80\x94Only the 727-200 with MD-9 engines in a typical airline\ncustomer configuration, requiring an average amount of rework in order to install the\ndelayed flap system, will be considered.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fleet Installation\xe2\x80\x94To be accomplished by the individual airlines using an MC retrofit\nkit supplied by Boeing. Customer installation costs to be expressed as kit installation\nman-hours and calendar time.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Certification\xe2\x80\x94A revision to the 727 basic type certificate will be obtained as part of\nthe prototype program. First-of-a-model certification to cover customer variations will\nbe accomplished by the airline.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Avionics\xe2\x80\x94The AEMS computer and cockpit displays will be part of the retrofit kit.\nAlthough cockpit arrangement may vary, the avionic components will be assumed to\nbe identical for all customers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fast/Slow Indicator\xe2\x80\x94It will be assumed that the existing ADI has no fast/slow indicator\nand will be modified by installing a Collins fast/slow kit P/N 768-1352-001 per Collins\nservice bulletin No. 7. The AEMS kit costs will include the cost of the Collins fast/slow\nkit but not the cost of the entire ADI.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Autothrottle--Costs are to be estimated for airplanes not equipped with autothrottles.\nAutothrottles are not required for AEMS implementation. Existing autothrottles\nwould have to be modified (additional cost) or turned off for delayed flap approaches.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Simulator Testing\xe2\x80\x94All simulator testing required for design support and testing of the\navionic software and hardware will be conducted using Boeing simulation facilities,\nwith vendor participation as required.\n\n23\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Prototype Installation\xe2\x80\x94The prototype installation is to be made by Boeing Flight Test\nOperations on a new factory airplane as normally delivered. The airplane is to be leased\nfor the AEMS test program and then returned to the production configuration prior to\ndelivery to the customer.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Flight Testing--All engineering flight testing and type certification (one 727-200 only)\nwill be conducted by Boeing in Seattle, Washington. No costs are to be included for:\n(1) DME ground station and (2) noise measurements.\n....\nNote: It is assumed the DME ground station will be supplied by NASA for the flight test\nprogram. Since noise certification would not be affected, noise measurements art: not required for AEMS certification.\n5.2 COST-OF-OWNERSHIP STUDY\nA brief cost-of-ownership study was conducted to give an indication of the total costs for\nAEMS implementation and operation and of the potential return on the equipment investment which could accrise from the resultant fuel savings. A typical domestic airline with a\n727 fleet of 58 airplanes (average) was selected for study.\nCumulative costs for implementation and operation of the AEMS and the cumulative dollar\nvalue of the estimated fuel savings (at 1976 fuel price) are shown in figure 9 in constant\n(1976) dollars. In the absence of a defined retrofit program, the cost curves are shown for\nthree arbitrary AEMS retrofit kit market bases (100, 200, and 500 shipsets), assuming all\n58 airplanes are modified simultaneously at year zero. Although simultaneous modification\nis not practical, the curves illustrate the total magnitude of costs for a typical fleet. The\nsome cost data are presented on a per-airplane basis in figure 10.\nAssuming an AEMS retrofit kit market base of 300 shipsets, cost and benefit data from\nfigure 9 were used in an investment analysis for the 58-airplane fleet. This analysis (sec.\n5.2.3) was based on present value of net cash flows, referred to as net present value (NPV).\nTwo NPV models were examined, one in constant (1976) dollars with constant (1976) fuel\nprices and the other in real time (inflated) dollars with increasing fuel prices. The cash flows\n(fig. 11) include a discount rate of 15% and adjustments for Federal taxes, which were\nexcluded from the cost and benefit data shown in figures 9 and 10.\nResults indicate the fuel savings would pay back tite initial investment in less than 3 years\nand provide a 33% to 38% rate of return on the investment, based on NPV, The additional\nAEMS benefits of reduced approach time and noise were not included in the economic\nanalysis.\n5.2.1 OPERATIONAL COSTS (EXCLUDING FUEL SAVINGS)\nThe cumulative cost curves (figs. 9 and 10) include initial implementation costs as follows\n(per airplane):\n\nt\n\n24\n\n1\n\n4\nMillions\nof 1976\ndollars\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\t\n\n4\t\n\n6\t\n\n8\t\n\n10\n\nYears of ownership\n\nNote;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tax adjustments and finance costs not included\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Constant dollars and fuel prices (1976)\n\nr\n\nFigure 9.\xe2\x80\x94Cumulative Costs and Fuel Savings for 58 Airplane Fleet\n\n25\n\na\n\n100\n\nm\n\n80\n\n60\nThousands\nof 1976\ndollars\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\t\n\n6\n\n\t\n$\t\n\nYears of ownership\nNote:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tax adjustments and finance costs not included\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Constant dollars and fuel prices 0976)\n\nFigure ia\xe2\x80\x94Cumulative Costs and Fuel Savings per Airplane\n\n26\n\n10\n\n.r\xe2\x80\xa2.\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\nMillions\nof\ndollars\n5\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa25\n0\n\n2\t\n\n4\t\n\n6\t\n\n8\t\n\n10\t\n\n12\t\n\n14\n\nYears of ownership\n\nFigure 11.\xe2\x80\x94Cumulative Cash Flows for 727 AEMS Retrofit\n\n27\n\ni\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAEMS retrofit kit purchase price (fig. 7)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nKit installation man-hours ($6100)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Spares purchase (10% of LRU costs)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nMaintenance training ($500)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Support equipment (main base only)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nInsurance ($650)\n\nThe slope of the cost curve reflects the annual operation costs ($400 per airplane) for\nmaintenance, spares holding, and the slight (less than 4.45 N (1 lb) per flight] cruise fuel\npenalty caused by the AEMS equipment weight, 111 N (25 lb).\nLine and shop maintenance cost estimates were based on the reliability requirements of the\navionic specification and on inservice data for similar equipment. These data were also used\nin determining the number of spare avionic units required (10% of fleet). In determining the\nnumber of spares, it was assumed there should be one spare at each line maintenance base\nand enough spares at the main base to sustai , the system with a 14-day main-base shop\nturnaround time. The maintenance training costs were based on the number of line and shop\nmechanics employed by the airline considered, assuming training times of 20 hr for each line\nmechanic and 80 hr for each shop mechanic. Main-base ground support equipment costs\nwere estimated to be $50 000.\nSome possible costs not included in the curves are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Airplane Down Time\xe2\x80\x94it was assumed the AEMS would be installed during other\nscheduled layups.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nInstallation Checkout Flight\xe2\x80\x94Except for first-of-a-model certification flights, ground\ncheckout should suffice.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Delays and Cancellations\xe2\x80\x94Since the AEMS is advisory in nature and would not be\nrequired for dispatch, it was assumed there would be no delays or cancellations of\nrevenue flights due to the AEMS.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Flightcrew Training and Simulator Modification\xe2\x80\x94Costs would vary with the airline and\nhave not been estimated. Probably the most economical way to modify the airline\nsimulators would be to install the actual AEMS flight hardware, including computer.\n\n28\n\n4\n\n5.2.2 FUEL COST SAVINGS\nAs discussed in appendix A, the AEMS allows use of DFA procedures that conserve 1420 to\n1750 N (320 to 395 lb) of fuel per approach, relative to current airline procedures. The\ndollar value of the fuel savings resulting from use of the AEMS was computed from:\nAnnual Fuel Cost Savings = (G) (P) (nDFA)\nwhere:\nG\t\n\n= Quantity of fuel saved per approach\n\nP\t\n\n= Price of fuel\n\nn DFA = Number of delayed flap approaches per year\nThe values used in computing the constant dollar, constant fuel price lines shown !n figure 9\nare:\nG\t\n\n= 0.17m 3 (45 gal) per approach (see app. A)\n\nP\t\n\n= $90/m 3 ($0.34/U.S. gal)\n\nn DFA - 0.75 x 160, 700 approaches per year\nThe number of DFA\'s assumes that delayed flap procedures can be used for 75% of the\napproaches. The domestic airline used as a basis for this study made 160 700 landings in\n1 year with a 58 airplane 727 fleet (average of about 7.6 landings per airplane per day).\nApplying the 75% factor (assumed) gives about 120 000 DFA\'s per year for the fleet (5.6\nper airplane per day).\nUsing these data, fuel savings are computed to be about S 15.30 per approach. This accumulates into about $31 800 per airplane per year (fig. 10), which results in a total savings\n(before taxes) of about $1.8 :ailiion per year for the 58 airplane fleet considered (fig. 9).\nThese savings based on 1976 fuel prices were used for the constant dollar investment analysis in section 5.2.3. The real time (inflated dollar) analysis used the same fuel savings data,\nexcept domestic fuel prices were assumed to increase linearly from $90/m 3 ($0.34/U.S. gal)\nin 1976 to $148/m 3 ($0.56/U.S. gal) in 1985.\n5.2.3 RETURN ON INVESTMENT\nA costs-benefits analysis, based on present value of net cash flows [referred to as net present\nvalue (NPV)1, was used to determine the return on the investment for AEMS implementation and operation. Two NPV models were examined, one in real time or inflated dollars\nand the other in 1976 or constant dollars.\n\nI\n\n29\n\n^\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nl\t\n\nI\t\n\nf\n\nIn evaluating an investment decision, NPV measures the relationship of cash expenditures\nversus cash receipt\xe2\x80\x94the net difference being annual cash flows. In determining annual cash\nflows, the annual fuel savings less the yearly direct operating costs (DOC) adjusted for taxes\n(50%) were added to the yearly depreciation tax credits and computed on the doubledeclining balance method, a form of accelerated depreciation. The yearly flows start at\nperiod zero and run through period 15.\nThe basic idea of net present value is simply to find the balance of the tradeoff between the\ninvestment outlay and the future benefits or cost savings, in terms of time-adjusted present\nvalue dollars. Present value is the inverse of compound interest. A dollar earned today, even\nwithout inflation, is worth more than a dollar earned 5 years from now, because the dollar\ntoday could be invested to provide a rate of return or earnings. In the analysis, a 15% discount rate was used. The term discount rate may be viewed as the minimum acceptable rate\nof return or an earnings standard. Given such a standard, it is possible through a computer\nprogram to determine the present value of all cash inflows over the economic life of the\nsystem. Since the net present value was positive in both models, it indicates that the project\nexceeded the earnings standard or minimum acceptable rate of return.\nTables 2 and 3 show the annual flows, the annual discounted flows, the cumulative flows,\nand the cumulative discounted flows. Table 2, presented in 1976 constant dollars, shows a\nnet positive present value of $ .0 million or an internal rate of return of 33% after taxes.\nTable 3 presented in real time or inflated dollars, shows a net positive present value of $4.8\nmillion or an internal rate of return equivalent to 38% after taxes.\nWhether viewing the investment in terms of real time or constant dollars, the return or yield\n(33% to 38 %) is greater than the assumed minimum acceptable return rate of 15 %. In the\nconstant dollar model, the rate of return was computed at 33.03 %. This is the same as saying\nthat with an initial investment of $3 433 691 an average yearly return of profit of 33.03%\nwould be realized. In the real time or inflated dollar model, the rate of return was computed\nat 38.22 %; here an average yearly return or profit of 38.22% would be realized.\nIn both models the payback period occurs in less than 3 years. This is the time required to\nrecoup the initial cash outlay needed for purchase and installation of the AEMS. This breakeven point is illustrated in figure 11 by showing cumulative cash flows and nondiscounted\nvalues for the two respective models. Initial cash outlay, the negative value entered in period\nzero for both models, is computed as: $3 815 212 the nonrecurring costs less the 101yo\ninvestment tax credit of $381 521 which equals $3 433 691.\n\n30\n\n\xc2\xb0\t\n\n:em.\n\nTable 2.\xe2\x80\x94Net Present Value\nAnnual\n\nFuel Savings - DOC + Depreciation Credit = Annual Cash Flow After Taxes\n\n2\n1976 Constant Dollars\n\nFlow\n\nAnnual flows\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n15% discount rate\n\n$ -3 433 691\n1 239 200\n1 186 210\n1 162 125\n1 138 037\n1 113 952\n1 089 866\n1 065 781\n1 041 694\n1 017 608\n993 523\n969 437\n945 350\n921 265\n921 265\n921 285\n\n$ -3 433 691\n\n1 078 104\n896 775\n764 678\n650 957\n553 634\n470 822\n400 734\n340634\n289 001\n245 379\n208 429\n176 780\n150 166\n129 898\n113 316\n\nCumulative\nflows\n\nCumulative\ndiscount\nflows\n\nrw\n\n$ -3433691\n$ -3 433 691\n-2 355 587\n-2 194 491\n-1 458 812\n\xe2\x80\xa21 008 281\n694 134\n153 844\n-43177\n1 291 881\n510 457\n2 405 833\n3495699 981 279\n1 382 013\n4 561 480\n1 722 647\n5 603 174\n2011 648\n6 620 762\n2 257 027\n7 614 305\n2 465 456\n8 583 742\n2 642 236\n9 529 092\n2 792 402\n10450357\n2 922 300\n11 372 622\n3 035 616\n12 292 807\n\nNet present value (NPV) w $ 3 035 616\nRate of return (ROR) = 33.03%\n\n31\n\nTable 3.\xe2\x80\x94Net Present Value\n(Annual Fuel Savings - DOC) + Depreciation Credit = Annual Cash Flow After Taxes\n2\nReal Time Dollars\n\nFlow\n0\n1\n\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\nAnnual flows\n\n$ -3433691\n$ -3433691\n1 077 427\n1 238 422\n1 251 591\n946 203\n851 187\n1 293 597\n1 335 528\n763 922\n1377303 684 559\n1 419 153\n613 074\n1 460 832\n549 273\n1 502 411\n491 288\n1 543 883\n438 463\n1 585 241\n391 555\n1 626 474\n349 692\n1 667 571\n311 836\n1 708 025\n278 408\n1 773 407\n250 050\n1 837 619\n226 027\n\nNet present value INPVI = $ 4 789 273\nRate of return IRORI = 38.22%\n\n32\n\n15% discount rate\n\nCumulative\nflows\n\nCumulative\ndiscount\nflows\n\n$ .3 433 691\n-2 195 269\n943 678\n\n$ -3433691\n-2 356 364\n-1 410 061\n\n349 919\n\n-558874\n\n1 685 447\n3 062 830\n4 461 983\n5 942 815\n7 445 226\n8 989 109\n10 574 350\n12 200 B24\n13 868 395\n15 576 420\n17 349 827\n19 187 446\n\n205 048\n889 607\n1 502 681\n2051 954\n2643242\n2 981 705\n3 373 260\n3 722 952\n4 034 788\n4 313 196\n4663246\n4 789 273\n\nL.\n\n6.0 GROUND FACILITY COST STUDY\nA DME ground station collocated with a glide slope reference (ILS, VAST, or other) is\nrequired for operational use of the 727 AEMS. A study to determine the availability of\nexisting ground facilities and the cost of the necessary additional ground facilities was conducted as part of the AEMS implementation cost study. Objectives of the ground facility\nstudy, as specified by NASA, were to determine the number and cost of the new installations necessary so that DFA procedures using the AEMS could be employed for 50% of all\ndomestic 727 approaches. To establish a data base for this study, the ATC Systems Analysis\ngroup at Boeing provided cost estimates for typical DME installations, and the 727 airport\ntraffic and facilities summaries presented in Appendices B and C.\nBased on review of the traffic and facilities data, it was concluded that no new ISL or VASI\ninstallations would be required to meet the 50% of 727 traffic objective. However, collocated DME ground stations are currently available on only 14 domestic runways which\nhandle Iess than 10% of the 727 traffic (see sec. 6.2).\nThe cost of installing one new DME station is estimated to be;\nDME\t\nlocation\t\n\nDME\ncost\t\n\nReference\n\nILS\t\n\n$ 60 300\t\n\nFAA facilities and equipment (F&E) budget,\nFY \'76\n\nVASI\t\n\n$100000\t\n\nBoeing estimate (includes additional costs for\nshelter and power)\n\nThe number of new DME installations required to meet the 50% of 727 traffic objective\ncould vary widely, depending on the criteria used in selecting the runways to be equipped.\nGround facility expense could be minimized by installing the DME staitons at the specific\nrunways handling the most 727 traffic. This approach was not used, partly because available\nairport traffic data for the 727 do not list traffic for individual runways. Instead, the\nnumber of new DME stations was based on two sets of DME runway selection criteria. As\ndiscussed in section 6.5, one method (low DME cost) emphasizes DME installation on runways with high density 727 traffic. The other method (noise emphasis) requires more DME\nstations distributed at more airports, including some with relatively low density traffic but\nwith communities located so that the AEMS would be effective for noise abatement.\nCumulative costs for the DME installations are shown in figure 12 as a function of cumulative approaches. It is seen that DME installation costs to accommodate 52% of 727 approaches vary from $3 to $5 million for the two selection criteria considered.\n41\n\nOperating and maintenance costs per year to keep one DME operational were estimated to\nbe $34 663 computed as follows. Reference 3 indicates that the FAA allocation for maintenance is 0.71 man-years per DME. Reference 4 indicates that FAA maintenance man-year\n\n33\n\nk_t\n\nNote: $12 Million would equip all ILS runways at\nall airports used for scheduled 727 operations.\n\n(percent of total approaches undetermined)\n\np.11 IL5and VAS!\nrunways at 16\nF busiest airports\n\nNoise emphasis\ncriteria-\n\nO\'Hare\n\nLow cost criteria\n\nNASA study objective\n\ni\t\nLAX\t\n\n10\t\n\nI\t\n20\t\n\n1\xe2\x80\x9e\t\n\n30\t\n\nI\t\n\nT\n\n40\t\n\n50\n\nDFA, percent of total 727 approaches\n\nFigure 72.\xe2\x80\x94Cumulative Costs for New DME Stations\n\n34\n\ncosts are approximately $45 000. Thus, maintenance costs would be $31 950. Stocks and\nstores (4.5%) would be $2713 for a total of $34 663/unit/year. Total annual costs would be\nabout $ l.7 million for 49 units (low cost criteria) and $2.4 million for 69 units (noise\nemphasis criteria).\nBecause of the arbitrary nature of the criteria used for this scoping study, these data should\nbe used primarily as an indication that costs for new DME ground stations are relatively\nsmall compared with airplane retrofit costs, e.g.:\nAssumed\t\ninstallations\t\n\nAirplane retrofit\t\n\n69\t\n\n$ 5 million\n\n500\t\n\nDME ground stations\t\n\nApproximate\ncost\n\n$30 million\n\nA 500 airplane retrofit program would equip only part of the domestic 727 fleet. 1f the\nAEMS ,vere installed in all transport models, the ground facility costs might become insignificant compared to the airline fleet implementation costs.\nIf an AEMS implementation program were initiated, a much more comprehensive study\nwould be required to select the best locations for new DME installations. Such a study\nshould involve the FAA (ATC, and F&E) and the airlines. The study should consider individual airline route structure so that each AEMS-equipped airplane could use the system at\nevery destination.\n6.1 REQUIRED GROUND FACILITIES\nDF\'A procedures are flown on conventional one-segment glide slopes. Since the AEMS predicts deceleration profiles for a preselected glide slope angle, some type of flightpath ref; erence (ILS, VASI, or other) is required so that the airplane can be flown along approximately the same final approach glide slope as that set into the computer. The path reference\nneed not be electronic because the AEMS computer determines the airplane\'s position in\nspace from altitude and distance information; i.e., ILS glide slope deviation is not used.\nAvailability of an ILS glide slope is preferable from a pilot workload point cf view, so that\nthe autopilot can be used. However, in the interest of operational flexibility, the current\n727 AEMS avionic configuration (ref. 2) does not require ILS signals, either for the energy\ncalculations or as an operational interlock.\n\nDistance and groundspeed information are necessary to adjust the profile predictions for\nwind, to compare actual energy against the desired profile, and to determine when successive flap, gear, and EPR settings should be made. Since a typical 727 is not equipped with\nu\' inertial navigation system (INS) or area navigation (RNAV) capability, the current 727\nAEMS avionic concept requires that the necessary distance and groundspeed information\nbe obtained from a DME ground station colocated with the glide slope.\nIn the interest of eliminating the requirement for installing collocated DME ground stations,\nan engineering study was conducted to determine if the 727 AEMS could be adapted to\n\n35\nI\ni\nai\n\nwork with range information derived from the ILS. Two concepts were evaluated: one using\nbarometric altitude and glide slope deviation and the other using localixer only (antennas on\neach wingtip). It appeared that AEMS performance would not be very satisfactory with\neither concept for several reasons:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Initial Approach Configuration\xe2\x80\x94ILS derived distance would not be available until\nlocalizer glide slope capture. To preclude overshooting, the pilot would have to establish\na reduced speed, higher drag configuration sooner than if DME were available. This\nwould reduce the operational utility and approach time, fuel, and noise benefits. \t\n\n...\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Seam Irregularities--Sample calculations of distance based on actual ILS beam data\nshowed that large fluctuations in computed distance relative to true distance could be\nexpected, even for "good" beams.\n\n0\t\n\nWind Effects--A derived distance signal would be too irregular to use in deriving\ngroundspeed, so the profile predictions would have to be based oil assumed wind.\nComputer studies indicated that the AEMS could advance or delay the flap, gear, and\nEPR commands to hit the stabilization point for reasonable wind variations, However,\nthe command spacing and speed margins relative to flight limits were degraded, particularly for headwinds.\n\nAlthough the study results did not conclusively rule out the possibility of eliminating the\nDME requirement, no satisfactory alternative was apparent. The studies of the ILS-only\nconcept were terminated, and the DME inputs were retained in the AEMS avionic specification. The ILS-only studies are reported in more detail in ref. 5.\n6.2 AIRPORT TRAFFIC REVIEW\n\nUsing information extracted from Boeing computerized files of airline operational data,\n727 approaches were summarized by airport and operator. In a typical week, Boeing 727\naircraft operated by 26 domestic air carriers made 30 455 approaches at 155 airports in the\nUnited States. The data for each airport, ranked according to total approaches for a typical\nweek, are tabulated in appendix B. A running total of approaches flown at these airports,\nbeginning at the most active (Chicago O\'Hare), is presented in figure 13, which illustrates\nthat a majority of 727 approaches are flown at relatively few of the 155 airports:\nCumulative\t\napproaches\t\n25%\n50%\n\n5\n16\n\n75%\n\n36\n\nCumulative\nairports\n\n40\n\n.\n\nr\t\n\nt\n\n!\n\n100\n\nValdez,\nAlaska\n\n80\n\n60\nCumulative\npercent\nof 727\napproaches\n40\n\n20\n\n0\t\n\n100\t\n50\t\nCumulative number of domestic airports\n\nFigure 13.\xe2\x80\x94Airport 727 Traffic Summary, 1975\nw\n\n150\n\nFive most active airports\nAirport\t\n\n727 approaches/week\n\n1.\n\nO\'Hare\t\n\n2744\n\n2.\n\nDallas/Ft.

The ILS- and VASI-equipped runways are indicated for the 30\nmost active airports. Thereafter, non-ILS runways are generally not included.\nRunways with existing DME ground stations colocated with the ILS are listed in table 4.\nAirports included in the FY \'76 or FY \'77 Department of Transportation (DOT) appropriations (FAA F&E budget) for new colocated DME installations are listed in table 5.\n6.4 RUNWAY RANKING FOR NOISE ABATEMENT\nThe DFA procedure reduces noise under the flightpath beyond the stabilization point, 152 m\n(500-ft) altitude. To identify some of the runways that should be equipped with DME if\nnoise abatement were used as the selection criteria, a brief study of community locations\nrelative to the runways was conducted by the Boeing noise staff. Consideration was limited\nto ILS runways at airports used by 727 operators for which community location data were\nreadily available.\nThe runways were ranked as shown in table 6 by the extent, in nautical miles, of communities located under the flightpath. Only communities between 1.3 nmi and 3.3 nmi\nfrom the runway threshold were considered because the AEMS would offer no noise benefits\nat distances closer than the final approach stabilization point, and community location data\nwere not readily available beyond 3.3 nmi. Due to unavailability of data beyond 3.3 nmi,\na maximum community extent of 2 nmi is shown in table 2 for the first 28 airports listed.\nThe noise benefits would extend for several additional miles at some of the cities.\nSince table 6 lists only ILS runways for which community location data were readily\navailable, it should not be inferred that a runway not on the list would not benefit. For\nexample, the VASI-only runways at Washington National were not evaluated.\n\n38\n\nTable 4.\xe2\x80\x94Existing ILS/Collocated DME Installations\nAirport\nLos Angeles International\nMinneapolis-St. Paul\nJohn F.

Since this is a scoping\nlevel study and the airlines, if any, that might install the AEMS are unknown, it appeared\ninappropriate to consider the route structure of particular airlines. Furthermore, data regarding traffic on individual runways and information concerning ATC practices at specific\nairports were not readily available, so no attempt was made to investigate the choice of\nrunways to that level of detail.\nA quick estimate of DME requirements was made by considering only the 16 busiest airports which account for 50 17c of the 727 traffic. There are a total of 63 ILS-equipped runways and 27 VASI-equipped runways at these airports. Collocated DME. stations are currently available on eight of the ILS runways, with installations on four other ILS runways\nincluded in the FAA FY \'76, and \'77 F&E budget. Additional DME installations would be\nrequired on 51 more ILS runways and on the 27 VAST runways. The cost for the 78 additional DME installations necessary to equip all 90 ILS and VAST runways would be about\n\n$5.8 million.\nA second estimate was made using a low cost criteria to determine DME placement. The\ncost per approach for a DME installation was computed by dividing the DMI\' cost by the\nnumber of approaches per week, assuming all 727 approaches to be flown on the ILS\nrunways only. Exceptions were made for busy airports having only one ILS runway (e.g.,\nWashington National and Fort Lauderdale) where one VASI runway was also included.\nThe airports were then ranked in order of lowest cost per approach as ^7dicated in table 7.\nLos Angeles ranks first because all ILS runways are currently equipped with collocated\nDME. The cumulative dollars and approaches from table 7 are plotted in figure 12. With\nthis low cost criteria, 49 new DME installations would be required at 20 airports at a cost of\nabout $3 million.\nThese methods for estimating DME requirements considered primarily the busiest airports.\nIt is expected that the DME installations would be more widely distributed in an actual\nimplementation program and that noise abatement considerat i on.- would be given high\npriority. Consequently, noise emphasis criteria were set up which would result in DME\ninstallations at more airports than considered in the second estimate. The airports and the\nnumber of runways used in plotting the noise-emphasis DME cost curve are listed in table 8\nalong with some of the factors considered in making the selections. The airports are listed in\norder of average approaches per runway computed by dividing the total number of ILS and\nVASI runways per airport into the total number of approaches per airport. The number of\nrunways at each airport used for estimating DME costs was based on equipping;\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAt least the first 56 runways shown in table 6, for which noise benefits of the AEMS\nwould extend over 0.8 nmi or more of the community\n\n41\n\nf\n\nTable Z --OME Costs Basuci on Low-Cost Criteria\n\nAirport\nLos Angeles\nDenver\nLa Guardia\nWashington National\nPortland, Ore.\nOklahoma City\nAtlanta\nNew Orleans\nDallas-Ft.

(The number of airports selected on\nthis basis (table 8) was limited to meet the 50% of 727 traffic objective.)\n\nUsing these criteria, 101 runways at 42 airports were identified as DFA runways. Excluding\nthe currently planned DME installations listed in table 3, an additional 74 DME stations\nwould have to be installed. Of these, 69 would be on ILS runways and five on VASI run-\t\nways.

This excludes the 14 existing collocatedDME\'s and the\n44 additional installations already budgeted. The cost of the 200 installations would be\n$12 million.\n\n45\n\nr f\t\n\n11 I I ^^\n7.0 CONCLUSIONS\n\nPrior NASA /Boeing engineering and piloted simulator studies have shown that the AEMS\nconcept can be adapted to the 727 and has potential for reducing approach time, fuel, and \t\nnoise. Pilot workload was found to be higher than for current ILS procedures but reasonable,\nbeing comparable to an IFR nonprecision approach. The procedures are compatible with\ncurrent systems, with no modifications required to the existing autopilot or flight director\nexcept for installation of a fast/ slow indicator. No operational restrictions on usage in tailwinds or icing conditions are necessary, although benefits are reduced, particularly with the\nhigher power settings (N I > 55%) required for inlet anti-ice.\nCosts for avionic development and airplane retrofit have been estimated using the preliminary AEMS avionic specification prepared in the prior study. The price of prototype hardware development and type certification is estimated to be $2.2 million. The price of an\nAEMS retrofit kit for airline fleet implementation would depend on the AEMS kit market\nbase. Budgetary estimates of kit prices, based on a typical 727-200 customer configuration\nare as follows ( 1976 dollars):\nAEMS market base\t\n\nKit price\n\n(shipsets)\t\n\n(per shipset)\n\n100\t\n\n$78000\n\n300\t\n\n$56000\n\n500\t\n\n$51 000\n\nAdditional one-time costs to the airline are estimated to be $10 000. This includes kit\ninstallation by the airline ( 256 man- hours) and other costs such as spares purchase and maintenance training. Airplane down time, not included in the costs, could be minimized by\ninstalling the AEMS during other scheduled layups. Annual continuing costs are estimated\nto be $400 per airplane for maintenance, spares holding, and the slight cruise fuel penalty\ndue to AEMS equipment weight. A cost -benefits analysis indicates the estimated approach\nfuel savings would provide a 33% to 38% rate of return on the investment, which would pay\nback the investment costs in less than 3 years.\nNo additional ILS or VASI installations are required to meet the NASA study objective of\nusing the AEMS for 50% of all 727 approaches. Based on a study criteria emphasizing noise\nabatement, 74 collocated DME installations, in addition to those included in FAA FY 76, 77\nbudgets, would be necessary at a cost of $5 million. If desired to accommodate additional\napproaches, the cost of installing DME on all ILS runways at all 727 airports would be $12\nmillion. In either case, the DME costs are relatively small compared with the costs for airline\nfleet retrofit. Individual airline route structure, not considered in this scoping level study,\nshould be reviewed prior to selecting runways for actual DME installation, so that each\nAEMS-equipped airplane could use the system at every destination airport.\n\n46\n\n1\n\nf\n\nAdditional development to improve the concept and further evaluations involving the FAA\nand airlines are required before reaching a conclusion regarding operational acceptability,\nIf operationally acceptable, the AEMS appears to offer an economically attractive means of\nreducing approach time, fuel, and noise. Prior to selecting the final AEMS configuration for\nfleet retrofit, the potential benefits of integrating the AEMS with other related concepts,\nwhich might utilize the same computer and displays, should be explored.\n\nr\n\n3\n\n1\n\nfa\n\n47\nr_\n\nAPPENDIX A\nThis appendix supplements the descriptive data provided in section 4.0, to summarize major\nresults of the Boeing engineering and piloted simulator studies. This work, which preceded\nthe implementation cost study, is reported more completely in reference 2.\nA-1, EQUIPMENT OPERATION\nThe pilot uses the control panel (fig. 5, sec. 4.2) to enter the desired final approach speed,\nstabilization altitude, and other operational variables (weight, glide slope angle, and field\nelevation). The proper time to make the successive flap, gear, and power settings is determined by the computer and displayed on the annunciator panel (fig. 4, sec. 4.2) by illuminating the appropriate annunciator light. At the same time the corresponding digital display\nindicates the desired flap or EPR setting. When the pilot responds to the command, as determined by the flap, gear, and throttle position sensors, the annunciator light is automatically\nturned off. The fast/slow indicator allows the pilot to monitor total energy relative to the\ndesired profile, which is particularly useful during the descent and initial approach phase.\nTo generate the information required for the cockpit displays, the AEMS computer performs three basic functions:\n1.\n\nProfile Prediction\xe2\x80\x94Using airplane thrust and dra , data, a speed versus distance profile\nis computed starting at the existing flight condition and following a predetermined\nspeed schedule for flap/gear/throttle setting. The prediction is updated at least once a\nsecond.\n\n2.\n\nOperational Logic\xe2\x80\x94Logic is provided to determine when the next flap/gear/throttle\ncommand should be displayed to the pilot, based on the results of the profile prediction. Airplane flight limits (e.g., flap placards and stall speeds) are included in the logic.\nEnergy Reference--The predicted profile is stored in the computer as an energy refererence for use in driving the fast/slow doughnut on the ADI.\n\nThe AEMS compensates for wind variations and other operational factors so as to consistently hit-the-target speed and altitude. For example, if high in energy (overshooting), the\nnext configuration command will be given sooner to increase drag.\nA-2. FLIGHT PROFILES\nA 727 DFA profile for a typical weight condition of 578 000 N (130 000 lb) is il\'ustrated\n:n figure A-1. The airspeeds for selecting the next flap detent were chosen to minimize pitch\nattitude variations (60) on final. The distance from touchdown corresponding to the first\nflap command is determined by the computer, and the fast/slow indicator assists the pilot in\narriving at this point at the desired speed. Thereafter, the fast/slow indicates energy deviations from the computed profile.\n\n48\n\n\t\n\nL\t\n\nti.\n\n727 Delayed flap approach\n*Typical landing weight\n(ft)\t\n\n*Still air\n\nm\n\n(3000)-- 900\n\nAltitude, m (ft)\t\n\nAt\n\n(2000} 600 152 m \t\n{500-ft}\nTarget\n(1000)\t\n300\n\nY .,-^\n\nr\t\n\nOM\n\na\n240\n\nFlap placard\n\nFlaps 2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n200\t\n\n\tAirspeed, KCAS\t\n\n5Desired profile (min 0$) computed on hoard\n15 010^\n\nGear f^\n2.5\t\nEPR 1.1 t\n\n160\t\n\n1.3 VS\nOM\n\nEPR APP 30 ^r\t\n120\n\n1.6\n\nNormal approach\n\nEPR\t\n\nEPR 1.1 to initiate spool ups+\n1.2\n\nIdle\t\n\n.8\t\n\n0\t\n\n2\t\n\n4\t\n\nOM\n\n6\t\n\na\t\n\n10\t\n\nNMI from touchdown\n\nFi9 ure A-1.\xe2\x80\x94Desired Deceleration Profile for 727 DFA Procedure\n\n12\t\n\n14\t\n\n- ^---- i\nl\n\ni\n\nThe preferred flight profile for nonicing conditions begins in a clean configuration at a speed\nof 220 kn. However, flaps 2 (at a lower speed) can be used with little reduction in benefits,\nand the AEMS will adjust to any initial flap-speed combination that might be required in the\noperational environment. Thrust is reduced to idle at a point determined by the AEMS.\nFlaps, gear, and thrust are then sequenced as indicated by the displays to stabilize at a target\naltitude above 152m (500 ft) selected by the pilot for the particular approach conditions. \t\nAs indicated, the nominal profile provides reasonable speed margins relative to the flap\nplacards and minimum approach speeds. This allows the commands to be given at higher or\nlower speeds if necessary to hit the target.\nPiloted simulator data for a typical delayed flap approach are presented in figure A-2. The\nprecomputed nominal profile from figure A-1 is shown for reference.\nA-3. BENEFITS AND PILOT EVALUATION\nThe piloted simulator data in figure A-3 compare the delayed flaps approach (DFA-1) to\nanother procedure (A-1) which is representative of an approach procedure currently used by\nsome ATA member airlines. Disadvantages of the delayed flaps procedure include increased\ncockpit activity at low altitude and delayed checklist completion. The higher initial approach speeds may cause problems for ATC but, in combination with the cleaner configuration, will provide reductions in approach time, fuel, and noise. The higher initial approach\nspeeds also allow flying much of the final approach at idle power, which further enhances\nthe community noise benefit.\nAs part of the Boeing engineering and simulator study, approach time, fuel, and noise were\nestimated for several types of procedures in still air, headwind, and tailwind conditions.\nDescriptions of the procedures and discussions of the potential benefits are contained in\nreference 1. Comparisons of the delayed flaps procedure (DFA-1) against two reduced flap\nprocedures considered typical of current ATA airline operations indicate the AEMS concept\ncould substantially reduce approach time, fuel, and noise.
