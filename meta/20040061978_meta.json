Similarly, the information will be used by the Genesis Sample Allocation sub-committee of CAPTEM to determine the optimum allocation scheme, and by the Genesis Curator to determine the processing sequence for allocation production. The plan includes a decision process and detailed examination and documentation protocol for whole arrays and individual collectors (wafers, concentrator targets, bulk metallic glass, gold foil, and polished aluminum). It also includes a plan for communicating the information obtained to the scientific community. The plan does not include a detailed plan for preliminary examination of the SRC lid foil collectors, the process for removal of individual collectors from their frames, or for the subsequent subdivision of collector materials for allocation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040061978, "id": "4c7eb075775146b894604b67b5d0b64b", "publicationName": "Lunar and Planetary Science XXXV: Genesis Mission", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "id": 20040061973, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Lunar and Planetary Science XXXV: Genesis Mission", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
