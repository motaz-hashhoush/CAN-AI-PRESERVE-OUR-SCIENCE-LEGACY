A percussive cone penetrometer was used in this study to penetrate a regolith ice mixture by breaking up ice and decompacting the regolith. As compared to a static cone penetrometer, percussion allows low reaction forces to push a penetrometer probe tip more easily into dry regolith in a low gravity environment from a planetary surface rover or a landed spacecraft. A percussive cone penetrates icy regolith at ice concentrations that a static cone cannot penetrate. In this study, the percussive penetrator was able to penetrate material under 65 N of down-force which could not be penetrated using a static cone under full body weight. This paper discusses using a percussive cone penetrometer to discern changes in the concentration of water-ice in a mixture of lunar regolith simulant and ice to a depth of one meter. The rate of penetration was found to be a function of the ice content and was not significantly affected by the down-force. The test results demonstrate that this method may be ideal for a small platform in a reduced gravity environment. However, there are some cases where the system may not be able to penetrate the icy regolith, and there is some risk of the probe tip becoming stuck so that it cannot be retracted. It is also shown that a percussive cone penetrometer could be used to prospect for water ice in regolith at concentrations as high as 8 by weight.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160005056, "endDate": "2016-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Civil Engineers", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "f6ef50759ea54593be2cc72edaf86b07", "id": "51e5e88fd04240528a5ef7a48b4020cf"}], "name": "ASCE Earth and Space Conference 2016", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "f6ef50759ea54593be2cc72edaf86b07", "startDate": "2016-04-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160005056, "id": "f1e70115c8e647a6adbfb356a487bc4a", "publicationDate": "2016-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160005056.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160005056/downloads/20160005056.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160005056/downloads/20160005056.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160005056/downloads/20160005056.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
