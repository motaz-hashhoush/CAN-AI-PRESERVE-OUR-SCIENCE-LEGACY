SHELS consists of a Marman band clamp push-plate ejection system mounted to a launch structure; the launch structure is mounted to one Orbiter sidewall adapter beam. Avionics mounted to the adapter beam will interface with Orbiter electrical services and provide optional umbilical services and ejection circuitry. SHELS provides an array of manifesting possibilities to a wide range of satellites.", "title": "Shuttle Hitchhiker Experiment Launcher System (SHELS)", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T09:21:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990087527, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Daelemans, Gerry"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "9123383dec954ec2a419ff61e02f9b0c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19990087527, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990087527, "id": "948e0137c5ed40919742e065c5beaa02", "publicationName": "1999 Shuttle Small Payloads Symposium", "publicationDate": "1999-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990087527.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990087527/downloads/19990087527.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990087527/downloads/19990087527.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990087527/downloads/19990087527.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
