Each pair of steps is repeated at needed intervals to maintain desired continuous movement of the portion of elements to be moved,\nsuch as the solar array of a spacecraft. In order to account for uncertainty as well as slow change in the\nperiod of torsional oscillation, a command unit may be\nprovided for varying the interval between steps in a\npair.\n\n/521\nMOTOR\nDRIVE\n\n14\n5\nI\n\n6 Claims,2 Drawing Sheets\n\n-\n\n26\n\n4\n*\n\n318/696\n244/170\n\nPrimary Examiner-William M.

This application describes a spacecraft solar 60 tion. Specifically, the spacecraft 10 includes a satellite\narray pointing drive which uses a stepper motor, with\nbody 12,a solar array 14 mounted via a shaft 16 or the\nthe object of achieving smoother array movement with\nlike to the satellite body through a gear box 18,comprisa small gear ratio and hence less of an overtorque reing, for example, a first gear 20 coupled to the array\nquirement. The thrust of this disclosure is the achieveshaft 16 and a second gear 22 coupled to a motor shaft\nment of fractional parts of the step through single step 65 24 of a stepper motor 26. Stepper motor 26 is driven by\nchanges of the drive signals. However, the problem of\nmotor drive electronics generally designated motor\nmechanical resonance of the load is not addressed in this\ndrive 28.Occasional command signals may be directed\ndisclosure.\nto the spacecraft 10 from a control station on the earth\n\n3\n\nI\n\n4,843,294\n\n4\n\nfor example. T o this end, an antenna 30 may be provided on the spacecraft 10 whereby signals may be\ncoupled to the array drive 28.\nThe array 14 is designated as element A. The satellite\nbody 12 is designated as element B. When the stepper 5\nmotor 26 is activated, a torque is developed by the\nStepper motor 26 which is transmitted to the Solar array\nshaft l6 through the gear box 18\' The rotation\nto a comnion\naxis Of the gear 2o and Of\nthe array 14 are given, respectively, by Og.Oa. In addi- 10\ntion, associated with each of the elements 1s a moment\nof inertia designated, respectively, by IGIA,as hereinafter explained.\nne simplified equations of motion relating the\ntorque TMapplied by the stepping motor are as fo~~ows:\n15\n\nTherefore, it is important to provide a mechanism for\neliminating oscillation or at the very least minimizing\noscillation in the long term.\nTherefore, according to the invention, the stepper\nmotor is excited in accordance with the following criteria: a first step signal is applied to a stepper motor at a\nf i t time to induce a first step movement of the device\n(the array 14)in a first direction, namely, a first angular\nrotation of a preselected fractional amount (as determined by the stepper motor and gearing). Thereafter, a\nsecond\nto the stepper motor to\nsignal is\ninduce a second step movement in the same angular\ndirection but at a fued time following the first time by\none-half of the oscillation period of the device which .\nmust be stabilized.
