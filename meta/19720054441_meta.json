As a first step in the development of a general model for STOL systems, a mathematical formulation is presented which accepts as inputs nine variables felt to be important in flight under STOL-type conditions and presents an index of human response as the output. The variables used are three linear motions, three angular motions, pressure, temperature  and noise level. The results are used to establish specifications for stability augmentation systems to improve the ride quality of existing STOL aircraft.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19720054441, "endDate": "1972-08-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "4740ca46a32742dc9dd0ec54bfbc9310", "id": "b2c46fb154814c289afb3016dc417658"}], "name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Aircraft Design, Flight Test, and Operations Meeting", "location": "Los Angeles, CA", "id": "4740ca46a32742dc9dd0ec54bfbc9310", "startDate": "1972-08-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720054441, "id": "4cb37284bfad4d01a313d6519c492a65", "publicationDate": "1972-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
