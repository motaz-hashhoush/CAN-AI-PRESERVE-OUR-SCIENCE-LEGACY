An air jet transporter\nbrings material from a trash shredder to the evaporator, while liquids from the urine\nseparator are pumped in.\n\nThe resulting slurry undergoes evaporation with high\n\ntemperaturepyrolisisof the evolved vapor, then further processing and condensation\nto potable water. The solids from the evaporator are first squeezed in a solids pump,\nthen carried to the incinerator in a cart system.\n\nThis total system is fully designed\n\nand was undergoing verification testing at the end of 1973.\n\nSome significant\n\ndifficulties have, not surprisingly in work of this type, been encountered and some\nre-design has resulted. G.E. has been reluctant to make full details of its work\npublic, citing the necessity of protecting trade secrets, but on the whole it seems\nto be progressing well.\n\nAlthough originally funded through NASA Headquarters,\n\nthis work is now being monitored by Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville.\nHamilton-Standard Division of United Aircraft (H-S) has been engaged in two\nlines of waste management work, both with Johnson Space Center (JSC) support.\n\n*Underscored numbers in parentheses indicate references listed at the end of this\nreport.\n\n3\n\nThe first was aimed at developing a complete waste management system based on\nspace vacuum drying of waste and overboard dumping of off-gassing products.\nResidual solids accumulate in a tank which is exposed to space vacuum after each\ndefecation.\n\nAir transport is used from the commode seat area to the storage tank.\n\nUser testing on earth of a prototype system over an extended period produced\ngenerally favorable results.\n\nThis system is probably very nearly ready for design of\n\nspace-qualified hardware, i.e., its development cycle is virtually complete.\nH-S has also done work in the area of steam and/or liquid reformation of\nwaste.\n\nFollowing a decision at NASA Headquarters, funding for this work was\n\nmoved from JSC to ARC and the work itself from H-S to the M.I.T. Chemical\nEngineering Department.\nAn alternate waste treatment method being developed by Lockheed Missile\nand Space Center with NASA Headquarters support is wet oxidation.\n\nHardware\n\nbuilt by LMSC for this system includes a grinder to reduce wastes to the proper\nconsistency for treatment, a reactor vessel, heat exchanger, controls and pressure\npumps.\n\n1.2 Objectives, Tasks and Schedule of the Third GARD Contract Prior to Re-Direction\nAs originally negotiated in April of 1971,\ncalled for three phases of work.\n\nthe third GARD contract (NAS 2-6386)\n\nScheduled for completion in October 1971,\n\nPhase A was to consider several waste transporter concepts.\n\nA basic design was to\n\nbe established and verification tested for each concept, each was to be analyzed\nfor function, configuration, operating characteristics, reliability, maintainability,\nand human engineering, and for each it was to be established whether the concept\nwas suitable for spacecraft application.\n\nDefined tasks to accomplish these objectives\n\nincluded design of a basic system for each of the three candidate concepts, fabrication of a simple model of each system, testing of each model, and modifications as\nrequired by design and performance criteria, evaluation and choice of a single most\neffective system for further development.\nTo be completed by May 1972, Phase B was to demonstrate suitability of the\nchosen system design and its conformance to design specifications, to demonstrate\n\n4\nthat it was sanitary and suitable for zero-gravity, to determine flow capacity, size,\nweight and power requirements, and to determine suitability of system construction\nmaterials.\n\nTasks called for included detailed prototype design, a formal NASA design\n\nreview (per NASA publication SP-6502) prior to parts fabrication, fabrication and\nassembly, verification testing using human feces, urine distillate residue, paper and\nother miscellaneous waste materials, modifications to incorporate necessary changes\nindicated by verification testing and performance testing.\nTo be completed by October 1972, Phase C was to integrate the waste transporter with.the four-man incineration unit which GARD had developed under Contract\nNo. NASA 2-5442.\n\nThe incinerator was to be modified if necessary to accommodate\n\nthe transport system components.\n\nDesign modifications were to be carried out on\n\npaper so that the GARD transporter could be used with the isotope-heated incineration unit under joint development by AEC, NASA and the USAF, i.e., the G.E.\nincinerator.\n\nTasks included modification of the incinerator design, fabrication and\n\ntesting, and the on-paper design changes for use of the GARD transporter with the\nG.E. incinerator.\n\nIn April 1972, an increase in scope and a 15-month time extension of the then\ncurrent GARD contract (NAS 2-6386) was negotiated.\n\nThe basic objective of the\n\nwork was changed from transporter development and integration with an existing\nincinerator to development of an integrated, zero-gravity waste management system.\nTo accomplish this broadened objective, Phases D, E and F were added to the work.\nTo be completed by April 1973, Phase D was to provide the means for users to input\nmaterial to the transporter, specifically a commode and separate trash chopper for\nfood scraps and housekeeping debris.\n\nTo be completed by July 1973, Phase E was\n\nto be concerned with an oxidant supply subsystem to satisfy the needs of both incinerator\nand afterburner, a product gas collection subsystem (if the rumored no-overboarddumping policy became a reality, this would be necessary) and an ash removal and\ncollection subsystem for the incinerator.\n\nTo be completed by January 1974, Phase F\n\nwas to provide a zero-gravity condenser to process the output of the incinerator\n\n5\n\nafterburner.\n\nPhases D, E and F each called for the following seven tasks: design\n\nand analysis, manufacture, design verification testing, integration, performance\ntesting, shipment and documentation.\nIn May 1973, another increase in scope to NAS 2-6386 was negotiated and a\nPhase G was added to the contract. Phase G was to include a tradeoff and\ninterfacing study (trading off the GARD system with other candidate systems;\ninterfacing the GARD system with a spacecraft), in-depth performance testing of\na totally integrated zero-gravity dry incineration system and a study of autoclaving\nas a waste management technique.\n1.3 Performance of GARD Prior to Re-Direction\nGARD issued a Phase A research report in December 1971, indicating the work\nwas substantially on schedule at this point (Phase A was to be completed in October\n1971).\n\nIn my view the report indicated successful completion of this phase of the\n\nwork and the report itself was an adequate account thereof.\nThough Phase B was scheduled for completion in May 1972, no Phase B research\nreport appeared until October 1972.\n\nThis report included detailed results of induced\n\nair flow tests for various sections of the pneumatic transporter separately and for the\nsystem as a whole.\n\nIt included vague descriptions only of the results of dropping\n\nsolids and liquids into the center of the input section of the transporter (some material\nwas blown back out), placing liquid drops on a pressurized porous plate (no air\ncushion was observed) and suspending water droplets in a porous tube (results were\napparently uniformly poor).\n\nI concluded from my reading of the report that all tests\n\ndescribed which were directly related to system performance as a transporter indicated\nnon-feasibility (though it is not my opinion based on everything I have learned that\npneumatic transport of human waste is infeasible).\n\nYet the stated conclusion of GARD\n\n(page 4-1 of the Phase B research report) is that "on the basis of tests conducted during\nPhase B... the basic concepts of creating a pneumatic drag effect with pressurized\nnozzles and supporting wastes on an air cushion have been shown feasible."\n\nIt is my\n\nopinion that the Phase B report conclusions were not warranted and should have been\nrejected as unsatisfactory relative to contractural requirements by the NASA technical\n\n6\n\nmonitor at the preliminary review stage; this would have precipitated earlier (prior\nto June, 1973) discussions of what should be done about the substantial schedule\nslippages which had by then occurred in the contract.\nAlthough explicitly specified in the contract, no quarterly progress reports\nwere issued between July 1972 and the summer of 1973.\n\nNo written reports of any\n\nkind, in fact, were issued since the October 1972 Phase B research report. Following\nre-direction, the missing quarterly reports were finally issued and a quite comprehensive interim summary report of all NAS 2-6386 work to date (2) was released in\nOctober 1973.\n1.4 Role of the Author of This Report\nI originally became involved with the GARD effort under contract no. NAS 2-6386\nwhen a mini-grant to Stanford University from NASA Ames Research Center under\nthe auspices of the NASA University Consortium enabled me to undertake a critical\nstudy of the work during the summer 0fi1973.\n\nThis study included examination of\n\nvoluminous file material at Ames Research Center, extended conversations with the\nthen Technical Monitor Dr. Jacob Shapira and a site visit at GARD facilities in\nNiles, Illinois, in late June 1973.\nmentioned above.\n\nI then wrote the limited circulation report (1)\n\nIn ensuing discussions with Environmental Control Research\n\nBranch Chief Dr. Philip Quattrone and Dr. Shapira, I recommended that the GARD\neffort under the then-current work specification be terminated and that a revised\nspecification of narrower focus be issued. At their request I drafted a revised work\nspecification (details of which are discussed briefly in Section 2.1 of this report)\nwhich was subsequently formally transmitted by AR\'C to GARD.\nGARD responded with Proposal 91887 for development of an integrated, zero-g\npneumatic transporter/dry incinerator/catalytic afterburner subsystem for spacecraft\nhuman wastes. I reviewed the proposal and recommended on 28 September 1973 that\nit be accepted.\n\nGARD was officially notified of acceptance of this proposal in\n\nmid-October and commenced the re-directed effort immediately.\nSince I was willing to continue being involved as a part-time participant in\nthe work and Dr. Quattrone and Dr. Shapira were eager to have me do so, I proposed\n\n7\n\nto NASA the funding of a modest continuing effort; as a result, I was awarded\nNASA/Ames Grant No. NGR 05-020-706.\n\nMy level of effort under this grant\n\nconsisted of one (usually lengthy) phone conference each week with GARD personnel working on the project, a half-dozen site visits, critical review of reports,\nspecifications and drawings,* and occasional reports by phone or in person to\nDr. Quattrone.\n\nDr. Shapira was becoming increasingly incapacitated by illness\n\nby fall 1973, so that even prior to his death in November, 1973, I had become a\nsort of unofficial surrogate Technical Monitor for the GARD effort and continued\nin that capacity until the end of the contract 30 June 1974.\n1.5 Purposes of This Report\nThe present report is the official final report of my effort under NASA/Ames\nGrant No. NGR 05-020-706.\n\nIts major objective is to review critically the\n\nGARD effort since re-direction at the end of summer 1973 and hence together with\nmy previous report (1)it is intended toserve as an assessment of the entire GARD\neffort under Contract No. NAS 2-6386.\n\nMy own function during my involvement\n\nwith the work will also be reviewed briefly. The report closes traditionally with\nconclusions and recommendations, many of the latter carried over with slight\nchanges from (1).\n\n*In fairness to GARD, I should acknowledge that some of the criticism in this report\nwas made with the benefitofhindsight. Other criticism was not strongly emphasized\nin my contact with GARD personnel during the course of the work because of my\nopinion that insufficient resources were available at GARD to respond to it effectively;\nin these instances I felt that I would, on balance, only hinder the progress of the work\nby speaking out. See also Section 3.2.\n\n8\n\nSection 2\nReview of GARD Effort Since Re-Direction\n2.1 Objectives of Revised Specification of Work and of GARD Proposal 91887;\nComments on Schedule and Budget\nThe revised work specification transmitted to GARD by NASA in August 1973\nindicated that further effort under Contract No. NAS 2-6386 was to have two major\nobjectives:\n1.\n\nTo develop and characterize the technologies of pneumatic transport and of\nincineration with catalytic afterburning as used in human waste management\nsystems for spacecraft so that a reliable basis is provided for flight system\ntradeoff studies, flight hardware design, etc., including especially the\neffects of zero-gravity operation.\n\n2.\n\nTo design a prototype integrated pneumatic transporter-incinerator-afterburner\nsubsystem and to perform comprehensive testing of the prototype with real\nwaste materials.\n\nFour tasks were described in detail in the specification. Task titles included:\n1. Particle Size Reduction Mechanism for Feces\n2.\n\nTechnology Development and Prototype Hardware Design and Testing: Subsystem\nComponents (the three major components were identified as the transporter,\nincinerator and afterburner with particle size reduction mechanism included as\npart of either transporter or incinerator pending the results of Task 1)\n\n3.\n\nTechnology Development and Prototype Hardware Design and Testing: Integrated\nSubsystem\n\n4.\n\nAnalysis\n\nResults of previous experimental work by GARD indicated that particle size reduction\n(i.e., breaking up the bolus into smaller fragments) was a requirement for proper\nincineration; GARD\'s inability to find a suitable mechanism for accomplishing this had\nbeen perhaps the principle barrier to progress prior to re-direction. Given a solution\nto the particle size reduction problem, pneumatic transport of waste materials from\n\n9\n\nthe collection site to the incinerator and the incinerator itself were the most important\nundeveloped components of a complete waste management system for spacecraft based\non the dry incineration concept. The afterburner was mentioned as one of the components to be worked on in Task 2 only because it was a necessary part of an integrated\nwaste processing subsystem; it was anticipated, however, that the catalytic afterburner developed by GARD during its work on the previous contract would be used\nvirtually unchanged (except perhaps for scaling up) in the integrated subsystem\nspecified in Task 3. This third task was to be concerned principally with extensive\ntesting of the integrated subsystem made up of components developed and tested in\nTask 2.\nAnalysis was called out separately as Task 4 not because it was intended that\nanalytical effort be separate from the development and design work of the other tasks,\nbut because previous GARD effort had seemed so poorly informed by even order-ofmagnitude analytical techniques that I felt the subject should be given special\nemphasis.\nGARD Proposal 91887 was prepared in response to the revised work specification.\nIn it GARD consolidated Tasks 1 through 4 of the specification into Tasks I and II.\nAdded were Task III for a paper study of autoclaving as a possible waste management\ntechnique for spacecraft (my interaction with performance of this task was essentially\nnil and it will not be discussed in this report) and Task IV for documentation.\n\nIn\n\nSection 1.2 of the proposal, GARD proposed "a modified program to:\n(1) Develop and characterize the technologies of pneumatic transport and of\ndry incineration with catalytic afterburning of product gases to provide a\nreliable basis for flight system trade-off studies, flight hardware design,\netc., including the effects of zero-gravity operations.\n(2) Design a prototype integrated pneumatic transporter/dry incinerator/ catalytic\nafterburner subsystem and to perform comprehensive testing of this subsystem\nwith actual waste materials."\nA third objective to be satisfied by the autoclaving study was also stated.\nOn page 2-13 of the proposal, Dr. StephenF ie lds-was proposed as an addition fe-the\nGARD project team whose "past experience in the area of fluid mechanics and gas\ndynamics should be of particular value in analyzing and optimizing the pneumatic\ntransport mechanism."\n\n10\n\nIt was explicitly recognized in my conversations with GARD personnel and with\nDr. Quattrone before and after this proposal was submitted to NASA that both the\ntime and money available (i.e., the time remaining before scheduled completion\nof Contract No. NAS 2-6386 and unexpended funds in the then-current contract\nbudget) were insufficient for accomplishment of the objectives stated in the proposal.\nAlthough it was clear that no further funding would be available, a no-cost time\nextension was expected to be necessary (as it proved to be).\n\nThe objective of the\n\nre-directed effort was to move as far as possible toward achievement of the stated\ngoals within the constraints of available funds.\n\nIt was apparent that a good many\n\nof the dollars expended prior to re-direction had not accomplished the NASA objectives and it seemed equally obvious that recovery of that loss was very unlikely.\nTherefore, the acceptable alternative for NASA was to try to get as much technical\ninformation as possible for the remaining funds.\n\n2.2 Brief Chronology of Events\nThe revised specification of work was transmitted to GARD in early August\n1973.\n\nIt instructed GARD to terminate all tasks associated with Phases A through G\n\nof the then-current specification and to initiate the tasks of the new specification.\nThere was to be no change in contract price and the scope of each task in the new\nspecification was to be subject to negotiation upon receipt of the new GARD proposal.\nThe following account of subsequent events is based primarily on my telephone\ncalls and personal visits to GARD and possibly errs in some details.\n\nGARD apparently\n\nceased all work on the contract upon receipt or prior to receipt of the revised\nspecification except for preparation of the missing quarterly reports, the Interim\nSummary Report (which was to describe results of all work on NAS 2-6386 prior to\nre-direction) and the new proposal.\nNASA.\n\nIn mid-September, the new proposal reached\n\nBy the end of September I had reviewed it and recommended acceptance.\n\nAnd in mid-October 1973, GARD received official notification that it should commence work as described in its Proposal 91887.\nConsideration of alternative concepts for the particle reduction mechanism,\npneumatic transporter configuration, and incinerator design continued through 1973\n\nand into early 1974.\n\nThe various exploratory tests which were performed and the\n\nconcepts considered are well described in the Component Performance Summary\nReport (3) of April 1974.\n\nIn early spring 1974, detail design of the components to\n\nbe used in the integrated subsystem testing began.\n\nMaterials procurement and com-\n\nponent fabrication took until May 1974; preliminary testing and system debugging\nuntil late in May.\n\nThe final series of tests was concluded in mid-June and the final\n\nreport then written in the two weeks before expiration of the no-cost extended\ncontract on 30 June 1974.\n\n2.3 Accomplishments\nPerhaps the most important positive accomplishment of GARD effort on Contract\nNo. NAS 2-6386 was the design and limited test results of the six-inch diameter\n(6 man design capacity) rotating paddle incinerator (4).\n\nAlthough there has been\n\nno really hard evidence either experimental or analytical that this is so, it seems\nreasonable to assume that the rotating paddle incinerator is much closer to a configuration which would operate successfully in zero-g than the stationary incinerator\ntested on the previous GARD contract.\nDuring this work GARD performed an extensive compilation and evaluation of\nalternatives for particle reduction mechanism, pneumatic transporter and incinerator\nconfigurations -- all of which would, of course, be required in a complete functional system.\n\nThese together with operational specifications for each component\n\nare reported quite completely in (3) and should be useful in any future development\nand design effort in this area.\nA number of particle reduction mechanism concepts underwent exploratory\nevaluation; results here were mostly negative.\n\nHowever, the reported results are\n\nof value since the nonfeasible concepts need not be tried again.\n\nEven the shear\n\nbar concept which was incorporated in the final incinerator design proved not\nfully satisfactory in testing as reported in (A).\nSome insight into solid and fluid particle motion within a rotating paddle\nincinerator is offered by the reported results of testing a transparent plastic incinerator\nmodel (3) and certainly the account of the successive trials of the 4-inch diameter\nincinerator (3) should be read by anyone continuing work in this area.\n\n12\n\n2.4 Uncompleted Work\nAny account of work that did not get accomplished on NAS 2-6386 should be\nprefaced with a repetition of my earlier acknowledgement that everyone involved\nknew that full accomplishment of the objectives formulated at the time of re-direction\nwas extremely unlikely given the time and money remaining.\n\nIt is nonetheless\n\ndisappointing to me in retrospect that several important categories of work remained\nnearly or totally untouched.\n\nThese include:\n\n1.\n\nPneumatic transporter development past the "on-paper" concept evaluation\n\n2.\n\nComprehensive testing sufficient to support technology characterization\n\n3.\n\nSubstantial analytical work of any kind\n\n4.\n\nZero-g vs. one-g issues\nI remarked in my earlier report (1) that there was a tendency for both GARD\n\nand NASA personnel involved with this contract to focus on hardware development,\nto the detriment of more fundamental work aimed at understanding and characterizing in detail sufficient for design of the technology areas involved. Despite\nmy efforts in the revised specification and GARD\'s apparent good intentions in\nProposal 91887, old habits and time pressure combined to maintain the old focus\nvirtually intact.\nTwo men who had long been involved in GARD work in this area left the\norganization during the post-re-direction effort. If more time had been available,\nthis probably could have had a net positive effect. As it was, however, it simply\nincreased the administrative burden on the new Project Engineer, Dr. Fields.\n\nMy\n\npersonal impression of Dr. Fields was of a man of very substantial theoretical/\nanalytical/experimental talent who never had a real chance to apply his significant\nengineering scientific skills to the problems of this project because his time was\nconsumed with managing it.\n2.5 Comments on Component and Integrated Subsystem Performance Summary\nReports, NASA CR 114763 and 114764\nOne thing which had particularly disturbed me when reading GARD technical\nreports on NAS 2-6386 which had been issued prior to contract re-direction, was\n\n13\nthe frequent failure to report negative results completely. The three major reports\nprepared thereafter (the Interim Summary Report (2) and the two which are the subject\nof this section) seemed to me by refreshing contrast very complete and frank, particularly in the narrative descriptions of actual results which made up the body of\nthese documents.\n\nSome mild advocacy seems to me to be residual in the intro-\n\nductory material in these reports, however.\nTwo of the conclusions reported at the end of the integrated subsystem report\n(4) would be directly useful in future tradeoff studies of waste management system\nconcepts, i.e., energy consumption of the subsystem estimated to be 2 kw\'hr per\nman per day and oxygen consumption approximately one gram per gram of waste\nsolids.\n\nBoth performance reports, however, would probably be much more useful to\n\nfuture workers if a conscientious effort had been made to abstract and highlight all\ninformation contained in or inferrable from the test results which would be useful\nin system concept tradeoff studies. Dr. Fields did treat many of these questions\nconscientiously in his lengthy letter (5) of 14 August 1974 to Mr. David Putnam\nof the SAE Study Group IV (see Sections 4.1 and 4.3) which perhaps should be\nmade generally available as a supplement to (4).\nI had explicitly included a requirement in the revised work specification for\nwritten operational specifications for both components and integrated subsystem\nbecause of my impression that GARD personnel had been having difficulty separating\nfunctional requirements from specific concepts for accomplishing them; with the\nparticle reduction mechanism problem, for example, they seemed to be suffering\nfrom a classic case of locking onto a concept early in the development cycle and not\nnot being able to let go of it even though results of feasibility trials had been very\ndiscouraging. The operational specifications included in Section 2 of the component\nreport (3) seem to me to have met at least my intended purpose for them well, i.e.,\nthat they be capable of serving as criteria for judging candidate alternative concepts\nbut not embody unnecessary preconceptions as to operating principle, configuration,\netc.\n\nSome parts of the subsystem operational specification presented as Appendix A\n\nof the subsystem report also serve this purpose well; others, however, represent merely\na description of the designed prototype.\n\nIt would make better sense to me to separate\n\n14\nthe descriptive material specific to this design from the specification of how any\nsuch subsystem ought to operate.\nTwo unexplained inconsistencies in the test results described in the subsystem\nreport are adequately acknowledged: the substantial mass balance deficits and the\ndoubled 02 consumption when these results are compared with those of the previous\ncontract tests of the stationary incinerator.\n\nThe mass balance deficits were subse-\n\nquently explained in Dr. Fields\' letter (5).\nIn closing this section, I want to emphasize my overall impression that these\nare good reports of the work actually accomplished since re-direction.\n\nThe stated\n\nobjective of the revised work specification regarding reports and reporting was in\nmy opinion amply satisfied.\n\n15\n\nSection 3\nReview of the Author\'s Role in Effort since Re-Direction\n\n3.1 Prior to Mid-October 1973\nMy work up to the time of GARD\'s commencing work under the terms of Proposal\n91887 in mid-October 1973 was apparently quite effective.\n\nI brought a fresh view-\n\npoint to a badly stagnated effort and because of my lack of permanent allegiance to\neither NASA or GARD could afford politically to grasp the nettle of acknowledging\nthat something had decidedly gone wrong.\n\nThe majority of my July 1973 report\n\nstill appears to be applicable to the GARD work from the perspective of a year later.\nI am also still satisfied with the revised work specification, though I have been\nforced to acknowledge that it was totally unrealistic in scope in the context of time\nand dollars available and the capability available at GARD.\n\nThe revised specification\n\nwould have been better couched in more specific, less ambitious detail.\n\nI do not,\n\nhowever, in any way disavow the viewpoint expressed therein concerning appropriate\nfundamental objectives for research and development work of this type.\n\nSpecifically,\n\nI remain convinced that technology development and characterization should be\nhigher objectives than specific hardware design and test in work this far upstream of\nflight hardware.\n\nI also recognize fully the difficulties of remaining true to this\n\nideal when upper-level NASA management wants tangible evidence of something\nfunctional for R & D dollars expended.\n\n3.2 Subsequent to Mid-October 1973\nIt does not really seem possible for me to effectively assess my contribution or\nlack thereof once the re-directed effort had begun, though perhaps the following\nobservations may help anyone else who tries to do so.\n\nWhether GARD perceived\n\nme as a pest, a help or something in between I do not know.\n\nSuch a perception\n\nwould be only a partial truth anyway, relative to accomplishment of NASA objectives.\nI probably made some direct technical contribution in the sense of solving or\nsuggesting directions toward solving engineering problems.\n\nBut probably my major\n\n16\ncontribution consisted in being someone who cared whether things were moving or not;\nI served as a sounding board and psychological support for a GARD project team which\nhad been apparently badly disspirited prior to re-direction.\nMy relationship with GARD personnel at the working engineer level was always\nvery friendly and cooperative.\n\nMy sense was that they were fully as concerned as I\n\nthat the best effort possible be made with the time and funds remaining to be expended.\nI never had any indication that the irregularity of my formal status (i.e., that I was\nnot a NASA employee and an official Technical Monitor) interfered with their\nwillingness to let me know what was happening and to listen to my opinions.\n\n17\n\nSection 4\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\n4.1\n\nRe: The GARD Effort\n\nMy final evaluation is that the GARD effort since re-direction was reasonable\nand workmanlike but certainly not overwhelmingly impressive in view of the time\nand funding available.\n\nWith prospects for future funding poor, there was little\n\nmotivation for higher company management to insist upon and support a superlative\neffort. Substantial progress was made during the re-directed effort nonetheless and\nthe results of the work stand a fair chance of being genuinely useful in the longerterm perspective of spacecraft human waste management system development.\nI hesitate to draw conclusions or to make recommendations regarding the suitability of GARD vs. other possible contractors for future work in this area. Although\nI did serve for a time as a member of Study Group IV under NASA Contract\nNASW-2439 which was concerned with such comparative evaluations (see Section\n4.3), my total effort in the area of spacecraft human waste management systems\nwas so dominated by the time I spent on the GARD work that I feel unqualified to\nmake such comparisons.\nThe overall results of all GARD effort on Contract No. NAS 2-6386 must, of\ncourse, be termed quite disappointing though that is primarily due to poor performance prior to re-direction.\n\nCertainly a careful evaluation of GARD capability\n\nrelative to any specific future effort would be in order prior to letting a contract,\nas well as close-in, technically qualified monitoring by NASA personnel.\n4.2 Questions Concerning NASA Conduct of R & D Efforts in this Area\nIn my July 1973 report (1), I included a list of issues raised by my investigation\nto date.\n\nThe list was presented in the form of a series of ten questions proceeding\napproximately in order from the most sweeping, requiring policy decisions at the\nhighest level, to the most specific; partial or full answers and their sources were\nincluded for each question to which I had been offered an answer or had thought of\n\n18\none myself.\n\nThe last question had to do with technical specifics of the GARD effort\n\nand has already been resolved for better or for worse by the conclusion of this work.\nThe other questions seem to me to be fully as important today as in July, 1973, and\nI therefore repeat them below.\n\nI have revised the answers somewhat in light of\n\nintervening events.\n1. Why does NASA invest in development of sophisticated waste management\nsystems when future manned missions have been so severely curtailed?\nDr. Shapira of NASA-ARC cited strong crew complaints about manual\n"baggie" systems used in the past.\n\nLonger duration missions seem certain to\n\nfly sooner or later.\n2.\n\nWhy is an absolute ban on overboard dumping even rumored?\nEven relatively innocuous gaseous products may foul sensitive astronomical\nmeasurement equipment, particularly lens surfaces. There is also concern about\nthe long-term effects of introducing contaminated micro-organisms into outer\nspace.\n\nThe products dumped by thrust jets used for station-keeping are always\n\nmentioned in discussions of this issue; their effect on instruments is not known\napparently. The overboard dumping ban is to my knowledge still in the\nnebulous status of "may be imposed" and gives the contractor for waste management system development, the impression that NASA does not know what it wants.\nThe overboard dumping ban was included as a contingency in the GARD contract\nprior to re-direction (the product gas collection system called for in pre-redirection Phase E-2 would be unnecessary if dumping is permitted).\n3.\n\nWhy had an automated baggie or canister system with autoclaving not been\n\nseriously considered?\nGARD stated that a proposal had been submitted "years ago", but NASA\nwas uninterested.\n\nNo clear NASA position on this issue had been obvious to\n\nme, though Task Ill of the re-directed contract produced a paper-only study of\nautoclaving; no doubt other consideration of the technique has been given\nsomewhere in the maze of various NASA efforts on waste management.\n4.\n\nWhy did NASA fund parallel path development efforts with different contractors\n\nwhen missions are so far off and uncertain?\n\n19\n\nNASA replied that missions are not so very far off when realistic delays\nbetween development and qualified space hardware are considered.\n\nPerhaps\n\nmore importantly, government competitive bidding requirements seem to\nnecessitate maintaining more than one contractor capable of doing such work.\n5.\n\nWhy did NASA supervise four different contractors doing closely related work\n\nfrom four different activity centers, practically guaranteeing total lack of coordination?\nThis writer suspects that competition between various NASA units, each\nseeking the glory of having developed the system which actually flies, is at\nleast as important as the need to protect trade secrets of the various contractors.\n6.\n\nWhy is NASA technical and fiscal monitoring of contract work so completely\n\nseparated, when the result is frequently inferior technical reports submitted to\nsatisfy a schedule rigidly enforced by the fiscal monitor?\nThis is no doubt the result of attempts to provide checks and balances\nwithin the government, avoiding the concentration of too much power in the\nhands of one man, on the one hand, and to avoid loading the technical\nmonitor with unnecessary adminstrative detail, on the other.\n\nIt is perhaps\n\nalso the result of a similar separation at the highest level; i.e., a relatively\ntechnically unsophisticated Congress seeking tangible evidence of value received\nfor dollars spent pushes for hardware delivered on schedule, while NASA\nmanagement recognizes that it is often more important to invest first in fully\nunderstanding a basic technology.\n\nIn any case, GARD had certainly felt\n\nstrong pressures to produce a hardware system which "works" (however poorly),\nrather than focus\n\non technology exploration in its development work under\n\nthis contract.\n7.\n\nWhy was a contract written for a complete system (i.e., the expansion in scope\n\nof NAS 2-6386 prior to re-direction to include Phases D, E and F) when the central\nconcept of coupled pneumatic transport and incineration had not yet been proven\nfeasible?\n\n20\nApparently NASA-ARC felt this was necessary because the alternative\nsystems being backed by other NASA centers were nearing readiness for complete\nsystem testing.\n8.\n\nWhy was a contract with a firm, tight schedule written when it was unknown\n\na priori whether one, none, or many ways were possible to solve various technical\nproblems associated with the work?\nLast summer I answered this one with the observation that GARD had\nindicated in its proposal a high level of confidence in concepts which had\nbeen validated by neither analysis or experiment, while NASA was (in my\nopinion) trying to use a tight schedule as a substitute for effective in-close\ntechnical supervision. After my own efforts at writing (what seemed to me)\na more sensible work specification and at providing in-close technical supervision, I am left with the sense that in exploratory R& D work such as this,\nNASA is very much at the mercy of the contractor once a contract has been\nsigned.\n\nThe technical monitor can never make up for deficiencies in the\n\ncontractor and short of threatening to cut off funding has little power other\nthan that of persuasion to influence what the contractor actually does day\nby day. A specific schedule is, in my opinion, a good thing if it is realistic\nand truly agreed to in spirit by the contractor.\ncannot be met is worse than none.\n\nA schedule everyone knows\n\nThe fundamental problem of how to\n\nschedule work when no one can know before doing it how long it will really\ntake is endemic to research and advanced development work and knows of\nno real solution that I have ever seen.\n9.\n\nWhy was there not effective technical monitoring prior to re-direction when\n\namounts of money this large were involved?\nEngineering personnel were simply not available within the cognizant\nNASA group, though this contract was largely concerned with the development\nof engineered hardware.\n\nThe scientifically trained monitor assigned to this\n\ncontract was overburdened with other work and had personal problems which\nreduced his effectiveness. Travel budget monies permitted less than two site\nvisits by the technical monitor per year.\n\nThe solution employed after re-direction,\n\n21\ni.e., a NASA grant to permit the participation of someone in a position like\nmine, might be used again.\n\nI would not personally be interested; though I\n\nknow I learned enormously from this experience, work in this area has not\nbecome a mainstream interest for me.\n\nFor an academic person already seriously\n\ninvolved or seeking means of entry to a field in which he intends to do serious\nwork of his own, a stint as a surrogate technical monitor might well be attractive and beneficial.\n4.3 Recommendations for Action by NASA\nMy earlier report concluded with four recommendations for action, the last two\nof which dealt specifically with the GARD effort which has now been concluded.\nThe first two were directed to NASA more generally and had to do, respectively,\nwith a NASA-wide review of work on human waste management systems for spacecraft and with the process of technical monitoring of work in this area.\nThe idea of a critical review committee was not mine and was already being\nimplemented in the summer of 1973 under the leadership of Dr. Jack Spurlock of\nTheodore Jonas/Associates, Arlington, VA, and with the support of NASA Contract\nNASW-2439 let to the Society of Automotive Engineers.\n\nI participated in the\n\ndeliberations of this study group during the last four months of 1973.\n\nIn December\n\n1973 the study group met with NASA Headquarters personnel in Washington and an\ninterim report was prepared early in 1974.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, this\n\nreport was never circulated beyond NASA Headquarters and the members of the\nstudy group.\nAs of the end of 1973, the study group had identified the need for more\ntechnical detail and some specific additional experimental results not then available concerning the systems under development at General Electric and GARD.\n\nThe\n\ngroup had agreed that until this information was available, further progress with\nits tasks was not feasible. Of even greater importance, however, was the apparent\nuncertainty within NASA as to whether further effort in the area of spacecraft human\nwaste management systems was to be supported at all and if so what the objectives\n\n22\nof such work ought to be. The study group therefore did no further work until very\nrecently (July 1974) when it apparently began again with its NASA-wide review\neffort. Since I am no longer a member of the group, my information about its current\nactivities is limited; questions should be directed to Dr. Spurlock.\nMy recommendations in July 1973 for the charge to such a review group still\nseem valid to me and I therefore now repeat them virtually unchanged.\n\nRecommendations:\n\na small committee of critical, active scientists and engineers from\n\noutside the NASA establishment should be provided the financial means to review\nobjectively all NASA work on human waste management systems for spacecraft. This\ngroup should undertake at least the following tasks:\n1.\n\nEstablish realistic general specifications for second and third generation systems\n\nwith estimated intermediate milestone dates and target dates for operational deployment (Skylab system is defined as the first generation system).\n2.\n\nReview all system concepts currently under consideration or which have been\n\nsuggested.\n\nDecide whether or not a detailed, formal tradeoff study is required\n\nbefore recommending a concept for the second generation system.\n\nHelp NASA\n\nperform or contract for this tradeoff study if it is necessary.\n3.\n\nPrepare written recommendations for the NASA statement of work for the\n\nsecond generation system development contractor(s); decide whether further technology development work is required before contracting for development of a specific\nsystem.\n4.\n\nReview the multi-contractor policy. If it must be maintained inflexibly, consider\n\nalternatives to the present duplication of effort; e.g., give an incinerator contract to\nG.E., a transporter contract to GARD and a commode contract to Hamilton-Standard\nand force them to work together by effective, centralized technical monitoring.\n5.\n\nReview the notion of an overboard dumping ban and recommend a NASA policy\n\non this issue for development efforts on human waste management systems.\n6.\n\nRecommend a procedure and date whereby this group will reconstitute itself to\n\ngo through a similar exercise for the third generation system.\n\n23\nWith regard also to the process of technical monitoring of work in this area,\nmy recommendations for action made a year ago seem valid still with minor modifications and additions.\nRecommendation: provide effective technical monitoring of NASA contract work\non human waste management systems for spacecraft by implementing at least the\nfollowing specific actions:\n1.\n\nCentralize all human waste management system development contract monitoring\n\nand administration at one NASA location under technical supervision of a two-man\nscientist/engineer team, thus eliminating wasteful competition between centers,\npromotion of "pet" systems and contractors, etc.\n2.\n\nScale the workload on the technical monitoring team so effective, in-close\n\ntechnical collaboration with the monitored effort is possible.\n\nConsider supple-\n\nmenting the team with part-time surrogate monitors from outside NASA using my\nparticipation in the GARD effort as a starting point for designing the best format(s).\n3.\n\nProvide travel funds for at least four site visits to each contractor per year.\n\n4.\n\nMake it an explicit NASA policy to be implemented by the technical monitor\n\nteam that maximum interchange of information occur at all times among all contractors working in the human waste management area.\n\n24\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nJ.R.
