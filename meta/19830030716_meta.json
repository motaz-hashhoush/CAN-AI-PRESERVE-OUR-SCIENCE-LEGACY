Traffic volume is suggested to be at levels exceeding the STS ability to deliver, thereby necessitating use of unmanned launch vehicles. Some payload delivery increase is possible using an Aft Cargo Carrier attached to the bottom of the external tank. This configuration would handle cargo with a diameter larger than the 15 ft allowable in the Orbiter bay. Various configurations of solid rocket booster cargo rockets are described, together with use of a module containing the Shuttle main engines and avionics as a recoverable part of a system able to place cargo 30 ft in diam and 90-100 ft tall in orbit. Using liquid reusable boosters would permit an increase of cargo capacity by the Shuttle of 50%, while a side-mount cargo vehicle (unmanned) offers a payload capacity of 165-200 klb. It is predicted that launch vehicles in the beginning of the 21st century will be of a fully reusable design.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19830030716, "endDate": "1982-03-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Spacelab, space platforms and the future; Fourth Joint AAS/DGLR Symposium and Twentieth Goddard Memorial Symposium", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "71c96048cbc34a659b76abfa768e690f", "startDate": "1982-03-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830030716, "id": "cb22a4da1d774464b654d795fcbde04e", "publicationDate": "1982-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
