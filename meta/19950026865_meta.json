Despite the advent of high speed personal computers and fast analog-to-digital converters (ADC's), care must be taken to ensure that reliable data are obtained in a timely fashion. This is especially true in hyphenated techniques, e.g. GC-IMS, where the amount of data increases dramatically when gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) data is being collected. Using the Graseby GC-IMS, with a gate repetition rate of 33 Hz, it is theoretically possible to collect 33 spectra per second. This collection rate is not realistically obtained due to a number of factors. Among these factors are inaccuracy of the timing signal from the IMS, the necessity to store the data, disk input/output limitations, disk operating system limitations, and program overhead. Taking these factors into account, we have achieved a data collection rate of 20 spectra per second. This paper will describe these problems, demonstrate the practical effects these problems present, and present methods for minimizing these effects.", "title": "Data collection in IMS: It's not as easy as it looks", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950026865, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Davis, Dennis M."}, "organization": {"name": "Edgewood Research Development and Engineering Center", "location": "Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, United States"}}, "id": "43e44bbb9e8d49ba8486ef273c12a403"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950026865, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Maswadeh, Waleed"}, "organization": {"name": "GEO-Centers, Inc.", "location": "Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD., United States"}}, "id": "c1a31f7cac904926bd2e7fea6b136e2a"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19950026865, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Shoff, Donald B."}, "organization": {"name": "Edgewood Research Development and Engineering Center", "location": "Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, United States"}}, "id": "68f70f19a1354b578f9c1d8be230d1a5"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19950026865, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Harden, Charles S."}, "organization": {"name": "Edgewood Research Development and Engineering Center", "location": "Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, United States"}}, "id": "e1dd16013f324883b0fda082d806a7b1"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19950026865, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Snyder, A.
