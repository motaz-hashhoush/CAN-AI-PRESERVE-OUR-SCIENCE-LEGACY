The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to show the intrinsic attributes required to adapt an earth orbiter into a Martian orbiter compatible with the scientific requirements, and (2) to show the minimum requisite changes needed to make the adaptation. It is shown that major deficiencies of such conversion for earth-orbiting satellites lie in the not-unexpected inability of its telecommunications system to operate at Martian distances and its lack of an autonomous recovery system from anomalous performance. Since these deficiencies can be overcome without too great a financial or schedule penalty, the study shows that the adaptation can be made cost effectively.", "title": "Earth orbiter into planetary orbiter - What's the problem?", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T03:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840059057, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brodsky, R.
