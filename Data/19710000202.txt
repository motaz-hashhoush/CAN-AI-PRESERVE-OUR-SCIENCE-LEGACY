Each cell is divided\ninto 3 compartments, viz., water, hydrogen, and oxygen. The oxygen and hydrogen compartments are\nseparated by a porous matrix sandwiched between\ntwo catalytically active electrodes; the electrolyteimpregnated matrix is held between these electrodes.\nA water-feed membrane separates the feed-water\ncavity from the gaseous hydrogen compartment. During electrolysis, i.e., when electrical power is applied\nto the electrodes, water vapor diffuses from the feed\nmembrane to the porous cell matrix.\nThe feed-water manifolds, ports, and compartments, are electrically insulated from current-carrying components, and the method of construction\neliminates intercell electrolysis, a direct cause of gas\ngeneration inside feed-water passages.\nThe primary structural material selected for the\nelectrolysis cells is polysulf one plastic, but polypropylene spacers and support screen are used in the water\ncavities. All metallic parts (except electrodes) exposed\nto electrolyte are manufactured entirely of nickel or\nfrom other metals that are subsequently plated with\nnickel. The latter method of manufacture was used\nto obtain thin parts with corrosion resistance and\nhigh thermal conductivity.\nThe water-feed cavity is filled initially with potassium hydroxide electrolyte at the same concentration\nat that in the cell matrix. As water in the cell matrix\nis consumed by electrolysis; the vapor pressure of the\nwater in the electrolyte decreases as the KOH concentration increases. The vapor pressure of the water\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis documet was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

As a result, water vapor diffuses through the\nfeed membrane during electrolysis, through the hydrogen cavity and the pores in the hydrogen electrode, and into the cell electrolyte. The transport of\nwater continues as long as the vapor pressure of the\ncell electrolyte is lower than that of the water-feed\nelectrolyte. Makeup water is forced into the waterfeed cavity from a feed reservoir that is divided into\ntwo parts by a flexible diaphragm; the pressure on\nthe gaseous side of the diaphragm is adjusted to\nmaintain the water-feed cavity at a pressure of 1-1.5\npsi below the pressure in the hydrogen cavity so as\nto prevent flooding of the hydrogen cavity.\n\nNotes:\n1.
