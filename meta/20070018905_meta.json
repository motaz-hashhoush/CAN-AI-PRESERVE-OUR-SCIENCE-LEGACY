The same pipes handle a number of different products, such as gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel or fuel oil. The fluids are temporarily stored in tanks, pumped into the pipes in turn and routed to other way stations along the pipe line. The complex job of controlling, measuring and monitoring fuel flow is accomplished automatically by a computerized control and communications system which incorporates multiple space technologies.", "title": "Pipe Line Control", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T22:59:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070018905, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070018905, "id": "d94ea770f46643faa3e559a064a2fbb4", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1978", "publicationDate": "1978-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20070018873, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1978", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070018905.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070018905/downloads/20070018905.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070018905/downloads/20070018905.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070018905/downloads/20070018905.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
