The goal of the mission was to return to Earth a very small part of a comet for study. The success of the mission gave us a small part of a comet to use for research into questions such as the cometary origin of water and life on earth and the formation of the solar system.  The slides review the challenges, the strategy, the laboratory experiments, the instrument development, the characteristics of Aerogel, the Stardust trajectory,  pictures of the samples and a listing of the firsts that were accomplished during the Stardust project.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Italy", "submissionId": 20070035052, "name": "Science Outreach", "location": "Venice", "id": "68b5ac024afe42028285c869c45ca905", "startDate": "2006-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070035052, "id": "9275c409bd8848b7a874862f00a4cb97", "publicationDate": "2006-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
