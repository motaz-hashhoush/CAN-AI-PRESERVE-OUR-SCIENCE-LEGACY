S. private sector\nin America\'s space future has emerged as a key\nnational objective, and NASA\'s Office of\nCommercial Programs is providing a focus for\naction.\nStrengthened by a rich tradition of NASA\ncooperation with industry, the office supports\nnew high technology commercial space ventures,\nthe commercial application of existing\naeronautics and space technology, and expanded\ncommercial access to available NASA capabilities\nand services.\nThis report, prepared by the Office of\nCommercial Programs, Public Affairs Office,\nhighlights the progress NASA has made in\ncarrying out its new assignment.\nFor additional information, write to:\nJames Ball, Public Affairs Officer\nOffice of Commercial Programs\nNASA Headquarters\nWashington, DC 20546\n\nLetter\n1988: A Year of Renewal and\nNew Initiatives\nReview of Programs\nCommercial Development\nTechnology Utilization\nSmall Business Innovation\nResearch\nSelected Economic Indicators\nInternational and Domestic\nR&D Trends\nSpace Sector\nBudget Highlights and Trends\nCommercial Programs\nManagement\nCommercial Programs Advisory\nCommittee\n\nTo our shareholders:\n\nEvery American is a shareholder in our country\'s space\nenterprise.\nEach citizen has contributed to our national investment in\nspace, an investment which has produced a high-yield return by\nany measurement. And each American has benefited, in some\nway, from technological advances and improvements in the\nquality of life that have resulted from our space program.\nThis progress report describes how NASA is exercising\nleadership in seeking ways to increase our economic return\nfrom space.\nA new era of challenge and opportunity confronts our\nnation.\nWe face a disturbing trade imbalance in a changing global\neconomy, and America\'s once undisputed position of leadership among the world\'s industrialized nations can no longer be\ntaken for granted. We face capable, determined competitors in\nthe international marketplace.\nYet opportunity abounds. Scientific discovery and technological innovation produce new products and services that\ncan benefit people throughout the world, resulting in entirely\nnew industries.\nSpace is proving to be a fertile field for such economic\ngrowth.\nThe United States has for some 30 years been a leader\namong spacefaring nations in conducting space research and in\napplying the results to practical use. Our success has won\nworldwide admiration, and inspired other countries to invest in\nthis new frontier. Where we ventured, others followed. Today,\nspace represents a new competitive territory for commercial\nopportunity and economic expansion.\nNASA is working with U.S. industry to ensure that\nAmerica\'s hard won space leadership is preserved and advanced. Through these cooperative efforts with American\nbusiness, NASA is helping to strengthen our nation\'s economic\nbase, enhance our international competitiveness, and prepare\nthis country for meeting the challenges of the 21st century.\n\n.I-\n\nX.\n\nJames T.

President Reagan\nsigned a new National Space Policy\nwhich strongl y supports a national\ngoal of creating opportunities for\nU.S. commerce. He concurrently\nannounced a Commercial Space initiative which outlines a series of\nsteps to advance this objective.\nThe 1980s has witnessed an\nemerging awareness of the potential\neconomic value of space.\nAmid a growing consensus that\nU.S. leadership in the commercial\ndevelopment of space is in the\nnational economic interest, the\nPresident directed in 1984 that\nNASA take steps to significantly\nexpand commercial space activity.\nThe Congress enacted legislation\nassigning NASA to "seek and\nencourage. to the maximum extent\npossible. the fullest commercial use\nof space."\nNASA responded by adopting a\nCommercial Use of Space Policy\nand establishing the Office of\nCommercial Programs (OCP) to\nprovide a focus for action to expand\nU.S. private sector investment and\ninvolvement in the civil space\nprogram.\nToda y , over half of the fifty largest U.S. industrial corporations are\nparticipating in one or more of\nNASA\'s programs to stimulate\ncommercial space activity.\nThese top Fortune 5(X) companies represent a diverse range of\ncommercial interests. Some wish to\nuse space as a new industrial laboratory, a unique place to do\nresearch and develop new or improved processes with commercial\nproduct potential.

Unocal\xe2\x80\x94these giants of U.S.\nindustry are among those that today\nshare it common interest in the\ncommercial potential of space.\nTheir participation in NASA\'s\nprograms to encourage the commercial use of space underscores the\nstrong progress that has been\nachieved in just a few short years.\nand validates a key strategy of the\nNASA approach: leveraging the\nU.S. government investment in\nspace to attract the enormous\nresearch and development muscle\nof U.S. industry.\n\nNew Management, Restored\nConfidence\nFiscal year 1988 opened with it\ntransition to new management in\nthe Office of Commercial\nPrograms.\nAfter a decade of pioneering\ncommercial space manufacturing at\nMcDonnell Douglas Astronautics\nCompany (MDAC). James T. Rose\nreturned to NASA and was\nappointed to serve as Assistant\nAdministrator for Commercial\nPrograms.\nHe brought to the job it strong\nbackground of aerospace experience in management of both\ngovernment and industry programs.\nLeading MDAC\'s companyfinanced efforts to explore the\ncommercial potential of manufacturing pharmaceutical products in\nspace. Rose signed the first industrial Joint Endeavor Agreement\nwith NASA. providing MDAC with\naccess to Space Shuttle flights for\nastronaut-tended research and\ndevelopment.\nDuring his first year as head of\nNASA\'s commercial programs, the\nfocus has been on new initiatives,\nstrategic planning, reorganizing for\nan active and growing flight program, and an expansion of the\nNASA-industry partnership.\nThese efforts have restored confidence in the vitality of the NASA\ncommercial development program,\nand built a new base for resuming\nindustrial sponsored research in\nEarth orbit, research that will ultimatel y lead to the development of\nnew products and services that contribute to America\'s economic\ngrowth.\n\nWithin it few weeks of assuming\nhis new post, Rose announced a\nprogram of new initiatives to\nrevitalize the commercial space program in the post-Challenger era.\nAmong these was the establishment of an industry advisory\ncommittee, it group to he composed\nof senior corporate and university\nexecutives who would provide\nNASA with the invaluable viewpoints of business and industry.\nIn February. the Commercial\r\nPrograms Advisory Committee was\nrmally created and Edward\n1)onley. Chairman of the Executive\nmmittee. Air Products and\nChemicals. Inc.. was named to\nserve as its chairman. A distinguished group of corporate chief\nexecutive officers and their university counterparts agreed to serve as\nmembers of the committee and the\ninitial meeting of the advisory panel\nwas convened in July.\nAs a subcommittee of the NASA\nAdvisory Council, the new group\nwill assist NASA by reviewing policies and programs, and recommending strategies to implement\nthe national space policy goals to\npromote greater investment and\nparticipation by the U.S. private\nsector in America\'s civil space\nprogram.\nAnother key management initiative of 1988 was the development of\na strategic plan for the next quarter\ncentury. This comprehensive plan,\nprimarily aimed at meeting the\nneeds and interests of U.S. industry\nover the next 25 years, is being prepared with the assistance of the\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics\nand Astronautics and it steering\ncommittee composed of senior research executives representing\ndiverse industries.\nFiscal year 1988 also witnessed\nthe addition of key management\nand technical skills in the Office of\nCommercial Programs to\nstrengthen and enhance the organizations support for new, hightechnology commercial space\nventures.\nThe office submitted to agency\nmanagers a reorganization plan to\nsupport the management and technical requirements of a growing\ncommercial flight program, the\nimplementation of national space\npolicy objectives. and the expansion\nof it research and technolog y base\nthat encourages increased commercial participation.\n\nExpanding the Partnership\n\nThe NASA-industry partnership\nwas expanded in 1988, with the signing of new cooperative agreements.\nIn August. NASA and\nSPACEHAB. Inc. signed a Space\nSystems Development Agreement\nto provide six shared Space Shuttle\nflights for the firm\'s privately developed and financed middeck augmentation module. The agreement\nallows the company to pay NASA\nfor standard services on a deferred\nbasis.\nThe Spacehab module is a truncated cylinder designed to fit in the\nShuttle\'s cargo hay and expand the\npressurized volume of the orbiter.\nSpacehah will provide customers\nwith a variety of locker and rack\naccommodations, with associated\nsupport and integration services.\nCommercial ventures and sponsored research requiring crewtended access to the space\nenvironment will provide the primary target market.\nAnother agreement signed in\n1988 provides McDonnell Douglas\nwith access to payload processing\nfacilities at the Kennedy Space Center in support of the firm\'s\ncommercial launch operations,\nscheduled to begin in 1989. The Office of Commercial Programs\nnegotiated other commercial launch\nvehicle support agreements with\nMartin Marietta and LTV.\nUnocal, which in 1988 continued\nits cooperative research and\ndevelopment effort with NASA\'s\nStennis Space Center under a\nProprietary Work Agreement, initiated discussions with the Office of\nCommercial Programs on a proposed Joint Endeavor Agreement\n(JEA). The firm, which is working\non the development of a remote\nsensing instrument to assist the\nsearch for energy resources, has\nexpressed interest in development\nflights aboard both the Space\nShuttle and the Space Station.\n\nThe JEA is a no-exchange-offunds arrangement under which\nNASA sponsors space flight\nopportunities for companies that\ninvest corporate resources to test\nand develop commercially promising concepts.\nTo facilitate early flight experiment opportunities for the NASA\nCenters for Commercial Development of Space and their industrial\nparticipants, work began this year\non the creation of a new agreement\nmechanism\xe2\x80\x94a pre-joint endeavor\nagreement.\nNASA also negotiated a Technical Exchange Agreement with\nAmoco, an industrial affiliate of the\nCenter for Advanced Materials\nlocated at Battelle Columbus\nLaboratories.\nThe family of cooperative agreements provide the framework for\naccomplishing key commercial\nobjectives: encouraging industr ydeveloped, commercially oriented\nresearch and development activities\nin space; supporting commercial\nventures to provide privately\nfinanced and constructed space\ninfrastructure and commercial services; and accomplishing the privatization of expendable launch vehicle\nservices.\nOn June 1, NASA published in\nCommerce Business Dail y an invitation for the U.S. private sector to\nexpress interest in commercially\nusing the Space Shuttle\'s jettisoned\nexternal tanks. The notice was the\nfirst step in implementing one of the\nspecific actions included in the\nPresident\'s Commercial Space Initiative. At present.

By gaining access to\nNASA\'s drop towers, research aircraft, and similar facilities,\nindustrial researchers can perform\nimportant groundwork that improves the chances of success when\nspace flight opportunities become\navailable.\nIn 1988, industrial users\naccounted for approximately half of\nthe total research activity at the\nNASA Lewis Research Center\'s\nMicrogravity Materials Science\nLaboratory, in Cleveland, Ohio.\nCommercial use was also\nsubstantial this year at NASA\'s\nMarshall Space Flight Center in\nHuntsville, Alabama. Industrial\nexperiments there represented a\nsignificant share of total usage of\nthe 100-meter drop tube and flights\nof the KC-135 microgravity aircraft.\n\nStrengthening U.S.\nCompetitiveness\nThe NASA resource of technology gained through 30 years of\nspace exploration is helping to\nstrengthen U.S. competitiveness.\nThe year 1988 marked the 25th\nyear of NASA\'s widely respected\nTechnology Utilization Program,\nwhich has led to thousands of\ncommercial applications of space\ntechnology on Earth.\nThe last two years have seen a\ndramatic expansion of the NASA\ntechnology transfer network, with\nnew linkages to state economic\norganizations and significant growth\nin the capabilities of NASA Industrial Application Centers.\nThe network now reaches into\nvirtually every state of the union,\nproviding easy access for large\ncompanies and small businesses\nalike to NASA technology.\nThe Technology Utilization\nDivision reported strong, continued\nprogress in the implementation of\nrecent congressional and executive\nactions aimed at accelerating the\ntransfer of federally funded technology into the private sector. NASA\'s\nwell-developed program is serving\nas a model for other agencies as government efforts to assist U.S.\nindustrial competitiveness intensify.\n\nScientist at the NASA Lewis\nResearch Center\'s Micrograt\'ity\nMaterials Science Lab analyzes a\npolymer sample.

NASTRAN is one of five\nNASA technologies appearing in the\nnewly inaugurated Spinoff Hall of\nFame, located in Colorado Springs,\nColorado.\nCapitalizing on New Ideas\nfrom Small Business\n\nThe Office of Commercial\nPrograms launched an effort in 1988\nto identify new opportunities for\nAmerican small businesses to\ncapitalize on their innovative ideas\nby developing commercial applications of space research. Wa ys to\nincrease small business participation in the commercial development\nof space are also being actively\nexplored.\nA growing number of small business concerns are initiating new\ncommercial products in many fields\nas a result of research and development funded through NASA\'s continuing Small Business Innovation\nResearch Program (SBIR), a program administered by the Office of\n\nCommercial Programs. Since 1983.\nNASA has spent or committed $175\nmillion for 755 Phase I and 299\nPhase II SBIR contracts placed with\n446 small businesses in 40 states,\nterritories, and the District of\nColumbia.\nDuring FY 1988. NASA announced the selection of SBIR\nresearch proposals resulting in 204\nPhase I contract awards from the\n1987 Program Solicitation and 85\nPhase II awards for continuations of\nPhase I projects initiated the previous year. Also during FY 1988 the\noffice\'s Small Business Innovation\nResearch Division completed a\ncomprehensive review assessing the\nresults of Phase II projects completed to date. Many of the results\nand products are being utilized in\nNASA programs and several have\nbeen successfull y commercialized.\n\nNew Economic Strength\n\nNew methods of transportation\nhave played a key role in expanding\nour nation\'s economy. In years past,\nAmerica\'s wilderness frontiers were\nopened for development by the railroad. Air travel has revolutionized\ninternational commerce, and aerospace products are today among the\nstrongest U.S. competitors in world\ntrade. In the 21st century, a robust\nand expanding space economy will\nbe the legacy of our pioneering\nefforts to venture outward from\nEarth.\nThe United States is uniquely\ncapable of leading the exploration\nand development of space, and\nNASA\'s cooperative efforts with\nU.S. industry offer hope for new\neconomic strength from America\'s\nspace enterprise.\n\nREVIEW\t\nCommercial\nDevelopment\n\nOF\t\n\nPROGRAMS\n\nCenters for the Commercial\nDevelopment of Space\n\nThe Commercial Development\nProgram encompasses NASA\'s diverse activities to seek and\nencourage the commercial uses of\nspace and to expand the role of the\nU.S. private sector in civil space\nactivities.\nThe program saw a renewed\nvigor in 1988, resulting from the\nresumption of an active space flight\nprogram coupled with major policy\nand management initiatives.\nCommercial Development\nobjectives are met through program\nactivities managed by two Office of\nCommercial Program divisions: the\nCommercial Development Division\nand the Plans, Policy, and\nEvaluation Division.\nSome of these activities include:\nSelecting, funding, and administering the Centers for the Commercial Development of Space.\nAdvocating and encouraging\nthe development of a domestic\nexpendable launch vehicle industrial base to provide access to space.\nNegotiating, executing, and\nfunding bilateral or multilateral\nSpace Act agreements in coordination with the appropriate NASA\nHeadquarters program offices and\nNASA field installations.\nDeveloping and maintaining\nrelationships with the private sector\nand fostering opportunities for new\ncommercial uses of space.\nDeveloping, in conjunction\nwith other NASA program offices,\nactivities which encourage: (a) the\ncommercial application of space\ntechnology.

That\nbreakthrough, in which scientists\nwere able to raise the temperature\nat which material becomes\nsuperconductive\xe2\x80\x94thereby reducing\nthe costs associated with coolants\nrequired for this work\xe2\x80\x94has led to\nfurther advancements in this field.\nIn 1988 one of the same scientists, Dr. Paul Chu, of the Center\nfor Space Vacuum Epitaxy, University of Houston, advanced research\nin this area even further with his\ndiscovery of a material which is\nsuperconductive at an even higher\ntemperature.\nAlthough the superconductivity\nbreakthroughs received worldwide\nattention, impressive R&D\naccomplishments have been made\nat many of the centers.\nCCDS accomplishments include\nsome 615 drop tube/tower microgravity experiments conducted, 21\nKC-135 microgravity flight experiments, involvement in four Space\nShuttle flights, one series of Lear\nJet flights, and five experiments\nprepared for a sounding rocket\nflight.\nSince initiation of the program in\n1985, participation and interest has\nsteadily risen, with the number of\nCCDS industrial affiliates now\ntotaling well over 100.\nIn 1989, an increased emphasis\nwill be placed on providing CCDS\nindustrial affiliates with opportunities for early flight experiment\nventures through the use of new\nagreements. In the future, NASA\nenvisions that each center will\nengender at least five Joint\nEndeavor Agreements.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 10\na\n\n-4\n\n986\t\n\n1987\nINDUSTRY\t\n\nNASA\n\n9\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\r\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\nExpendable Launch Vehicle\nPrivatization\nAssuring a highway to space by\nfostering growth of a U.S. commercial launch industry is one of the key\ninitiatives of the President\'s new\nnational space policy. Over the past\nfew years. NASA\'s efforts to advocate and encourage development of\nan expendable launch vehicle\n(ELV) industrial base have helped\nmake commercial space transportation services a reality.\nNASA\'s signing in 1987 of the\nfirst agreement transferring operation of a government-developed\nELV to the private sector marked a\nmajor milestone in these efforts.\nThe agreement was with General\nDynamics Corp. for operation of\nthe Atlas Centaur vehicle.\nKennedy Space Center has\nentered into a related agreement\nwith General Dynamics allowing\nthe company to use NASA Launch\nComplex 36 and associated facilities\nfor commercial launch operations of\nthe Atlas Centaur vehicle.\nIn 1988, NASA and the Department of Commerce made history\nwith their award of a $200 million\ncontract to General Dynamics to\nprovide ELV transportation services for the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration\'s family of geostationary operational\nenvironmental satellites, marking\nthe first U.S. government procurement of commercial launch services.\nNASA also signed this year an\nagreement with McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics Company.\nmanufacturer of the commercial\nDelta launch vehicle, for use of\nKennedy Space Center payload\nprocessing and launch facilities.\nSimilar agreements are also\nbeing negotiated with Martin Marietta, producer of the Titan, and\nLTV, which builds the Scout\nvehicle.\nNASA\'s efforts to assist the\nstartup of new, privately developed\nlaunch vehicles by entrepreneurial\nfirms is demonstrated by the\nagency\'s 1987 Memorandum of\nAgreement with Space Services,\nInc., for use of NASA\'s Wallops\nFlight Facility in Virginia. The company plans to begin commercial\nlaunches of their Conestoga vehicle\nin 1989. A similar agreement with\nConatec was under negotiation.\n\n1ff\n\nFurther support for the new\nindustry comes from NASA\'s adoption in 1988 of a mixed-fleet plan. in\nwhich unmanned launches, purchased by NASA as a commercial\nservice, will complement Space\nShuttle operations. A need has been\nidentified for 30 such government\npurchased launches throu g h 1994.\n\nAn Atlas- Centaur rocket rises Jroni\nits Cape Canaveral launch pad.\nDeveloped by NASA as a government launch vehicle, the AtlasCentaur has been privatized through\nan agreement between NASA and\nGeneral Dynamics, its manufacturer. General Dynamics will\nprivately produce the booster and\nmarket commercial launch services.\n\nSupport for New High-Tech\nCommercial Ventures\nIn 1988 Commercial Development also sought to increase and\nbroaden its support for new hightechnology commercial space\nventures by coordinating NASA\'s\nnegotiation, execution, and funding\nof a variety of bilateral and multilateral agreements with industry.\nActivities in this area were aimed\nnot only at increasing the number of\nagreements signed, but also at\nreviewing the type of agreements\npresently offered and anticipating\nthe types of agreements which will\nbe needed in the future to facilitate\ngrowth of a vigorous U.S. commercial space industry.\nAt present, NASA utilizes a\nnumber of innovative and functional agreements which provide\nindustry with assistance, services,\nand facilities to help reduce the risks\nassociated with commercial space\nventures.\nThis family of agreements\ninclude:\nJoint Endeavor Agreements,\nwhich involve no exchange of funds\nand are designed to encourage early\nspace ventures and demonstrate the\nuse of space technology to meet\nmarketplace needs. Private industry\nfunds the experiments and NASA\nprovides transportation and other\nservices.\nSpace Systems Development\nAgreements, providing industry\nwith a deferred payment schedule\nfor Shuttle launch services. This\nallows the entrepreneur to have a\nmore favorable cash flow during a\ntime when capital investment costs\nare typically the greatest.

An ambitious\nassessment was also undertaken to\nreview the program\'s status and\nprogress, as well as to help NASA\nmanagement determine a future\ncourse.\nThe program was instituted in\n1983 to comply with congressional\nSBIR legislation and policy guidelines established by the Small\nBusiness Administration.\nNASA finances SBIR by setting\naside one and one-quarter percent\nof its annual research and development appropriation for the award of\nPhase I and Phase II contracts to\nsmall businesses. Proposals are requested annually in areas of interest\nto the agency, many of which have\ncommercial potential. Contracts are\nplaced and projects are managed by\nnine NASA field installations across\nthe country.\nSpecifically. NASA\'s SBIR Program and SBIR legislation seeks to\nstimulate U.S. technological\ninnovation, increase the participation of small businesses in federal\nR&D programs, foster greater\nparticipation of minority and disadvantaged persons, and increase\ncommercialization in the private\nsector of innovations derived from\nfederal R&D.\nTo meet these objectives, the\nprogram undertakes a number of\nactivities including:\n\nBiospherical Instruments, Inc. \'s\nmoored oceanographic spectroradiometer, a commercially\nsuccessful SBIR project developed\nunder contract to NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory, is shown\nbeing maintained by a diver off the\ncoast of La Jolla, Calif.\nFormulating policies, and\ndeveloping, overseeing, evaluating,\nand implementing NASA SBIR\nactivities which encourage U.S. private sector participation in civil\nspace activities.\nSelecting and funding small\nbusiness activities that directly support NASA program objectives and\nrequirements.\nIncreasing the small business\ncommunity\'s awareness and\nparticipation in NASA\'s SBIR and\nother programs.\nDeveloping a synergy between\nthe NASA SBIR program and other\nOffice of Commercial Program\nobjectives and programs.\nOCP Budget for Small Business\nInnovative Research Program\n4\xc2\xb0\n\na\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n\n0\nIs\n10\n\n15 N5\t\n\n16\n\nFY 86\t\n\nVV 87\t\n\nFY 98\n\nAssessing Progress\n\nIn 1988 an assessment of the program was conducted to establish the\nbasis for an agency position on\nSBIR, which was transmitted to the\nGeneral Accounting Office.

Reasons given included a sense of\npersonal commitment to an idea of\ntheir own, the incentive provided by\nthe focus on a product having\ncommercial potential, and adequate\nfunding, along with a definite schedule for completion.\nThe projects studied were also\nfound to have significant applications by NASA. NASA personnel\njudged more than half of the\nprojects to have either immediate\napplications in NASA missions or\ngood prospects for being chosen\nwithin five years.\nThe assessment also disclosed\nthat successful commercial applications are developing from the\nprojects. Some 22 percent of the\n\nprojects were said by small business\nofficials to be well along in the\ncommercialization process.\nAnother 12 were judged by company officials as having good\nprospects for generating marketable\nproducts.\nAn example of the commercial\nand scientific benefits of one of the\nfirst completed SBIR projects is evident in the moored oceanographic\nspectro-radiometer developed by\nBiospherical Instruments, Inc.\nunder contract to NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.\nThe optical instrument system,\nwhich was designed to provide spectral data on sunlight reflected in the\nocean, is now the standard for longterm monitoring of the ocean\'s\nsurface.

The project has also become\nthe basis for expansion of this business and company development of\nadditional optical sensing\ncapabilities.\n\nNASA SBIR Award Distribution by State\n\nPHASE I\n\nProgram\nSolicitation\nYear\n\nProposals\n\n1983\n\n977\n\n102\n\n4.93\n\n1984\n\n919\n\n127\n\n6.23\n\n1985\n\n1164\n\n150\n\n1986\n\n1628\n\n1987\n\nTOTALS\nTO\n\nAwards\t\n\nTotal\nFunding\n$M\n\nPHASE II\n\nAverage\t\nFunding\n\n483\n\nProposals\n\nAwards\n\nTotal\nFunding\n$M\n\nAverage\nFunding\n$K\n\nPhase III Funding\nCommitments\nTotal\n\nAwards\n\nTotal\nProgram\nFunding\n$M\n\n92\n\n58\n\n23.77\n\n410\n\n54\n\n37\n\n28.70\n\n49.1\n\n113\n\n71\n\n32.91\n\n463\n\n62\n\n38\n\n39.14\n\n7.43\n\n49.5\n\n129\n\n85\n\n40.48\n\n476\n\n55\n\n41\n\n48.91\n\n172\n\n8.5\n\n49.4\n\n154\n\n85\n\n40.49\n\n476\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n48.99\n\n1826\n\n204\n\n10.1\n\n49.2\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n6514\n\n755\n\n37.2\n\n49.4\n\n488\n\n299\n\n137.65\n\n460\n\n171\n\n116\n\n164.74(1)\n\nDATE\n\nNOTE: (1) Total program funding is for first four program solicitation years, Phase I plus Phase II\n\n17\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\r\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\nNASA SBIR Award Distribution by State\n\nAwards by Program Year\n83-1\n84-1\n85-1\n86-1\n87-1\n\nPhase I & II\nII\nPhase I\t\nPhase 1 & II\nPhase I & II\nPhase I\n\n(160)\n(199)\n(235)\n(256)\n(204)\n1054\n\nSelecting and Funding\nInnovative Ideas\n\nSBIR activities in 1988 to select\nand fund small business ventures\nthat support NASA missions culminated in the issuance of the sixth\nannual SBIR Program Solicitation.\nThe solicitation invited qualified\nsmall businesses to submit proposals\nin response to 150 subtopics contained in 15 Technical Topic areas.\nEach subtopic described research\nproblems or desirable innovations\nwhich could assist NASA in its mission. Many of these innovations\ncould also lead to commercial\napplications for the small\nbusinesses.\nThe 1988 solicitation is expected\nto result in more than 200 Phase I\ncontracts, totalling $10 million.\nThese contracts have a maximum\nvalue of $50.00() each and six-month\ndurations to investigate the feasibility of innovative ideas proposed in\nresponse to the solicitation.\nIn 1989, about half of the Phase I\nprojects selected in 1988\xe2\x80\x94those\nwhich show the most promise and\nvalue to NASA at completion\xe2\x80\x94will\nbe selected competitively for twoyear, follow-on Phase II contracts,\nvalued at up to $500,000.\nFrom the 1987 program solicitation, $40 million in SBIR funding\n18\n\nwas used to fund 204 Phase I contract awards and for incremental\nfunding support of 170 Phase II contracts resulting from the previous\ntwo annual solicitations.\nSince 1983, the agency has spent\nor committed $175 million for 755\nPhase I and 299 Phase II contracts\nplaced with 446 small businesses in\n40 states, territories and the District\nof Columbia.\nThe program continues to attract\nincreasing interest among small\nbusiness community members. The\nnumber of proposals received from\nannual solicitations more than doubled since initiation of the program,\nincreasing from 977 proposals\nsubmitted in 1983 to 2.379 in 1988.\nTo further draw the talent and\ncreativity of this labor pool to its\nmissions, NASA undertook new\nefforts in 1988 to increase the small\nbusiness community\'s awareness\nand participation in SBIR and other\nprograms.\nIn addition to attracting these\nfirms through annual requests for\nproposals, the agency is presently\nworking with the Small Business\nAdministration to develop linkages\nbetween the NASA Industrial\nApplication Network and Small\nBusiness Development Centers.\n\nSmall Business Links to the\nCommercial Development of\nSpace\nNew efforts were also undertaken in 1988 toward developing\nfurther synergy between the NASA\nSBIR Program and other Office of\nCommercial Program objectives\nand programs.\nThe 1988 SBIR solicitation included several subtopics which were\ndirectly related to commercial space\napplications. OCP may issue a special solicitation on commercial\nspace opportunities at a later date,\ndepending on the response to this\nsolicitation and on the possible\ndevelopment of new ways to assist\nsmall businesses in developing the\ncommercial potential of their\nprojects.\n\nSELECTED\t\n\nECONOMIC\t\n\nThe charts and graphs included in this section\ncharacterize key international and domestic trends\nin research and development expenditures.
