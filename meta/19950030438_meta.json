Forty-eight weeks of coarse resolution Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a digitized climax vegetation map, land cover samples from space shuttle photographs and actual vegetation samples were used as inputs. Principal components analyses and a clustering algorithm were applied to the NDVI data to generate a single layer that was stratified by the climax vegetation zones map. The purpose is to create a new layer that differentiates climax vegetation (hypothesized potential vegetation) from non-climax vegetation land covers. One of the keys to developing a present-day vegetation map was differentiating intrazone land covers based on the stratification; as great as 75% of the sampled land cover types differed from the climax vegetation. The present-day vegetation map achieved 80% classification accuracy when calculated from available ground reference data. About 55% of the temperate zones and 37% of the tropical zones were found to contain original climax vegetation. Most changes coincide with areas of major agricultural activity.", "title": "Mapping small-scale vegetation changes in Mexico", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T21:59:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950030438, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Turcotte, Kevin M."}, "organization": {"name": "Ball State University", "location": "Muncie, IN, United States"}}, "id": "a4207126974041e99f487757368b6568"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950030438, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lulla, Kemlesh"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "41c486700111458294d79629849a1382"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19950030438, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Venugopal, Gopalan"}, "organization": {"name": "Ball State University", "location": "Muncie, IN, United States"}}, "id": "58b65f5e78b74b6ea89c1fed278711f6"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950030438, "publications": [{"volume": "8", "submissionId": 19950030438, "issue": "4", "issn": "1010-6049", "id": "d4e55256a0c6481e8a5d3a465f4297fc", "publicationName": "Geocarto", "publicationDate": "1993-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
