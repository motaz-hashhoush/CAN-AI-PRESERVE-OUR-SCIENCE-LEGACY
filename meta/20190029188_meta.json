Building off previous free flyer experience, this technology will eventually improve safety of human spacecraft by offering a variety of inspection capabilities for both routine and emergency scenarios providing increased capability and safety over current inspection methods. Seeker 1.0 is capable of 6 degree of freedom flight via a cold gas propulsion system and can operate up to 1 hour via a semi-autonomous guidance, navigation, and control system. The prototype spacecraft is capable of capturing still images at a variety of resolutions up to 13 MP. The initial test flight utilizes a command and data relay box called Kenobi. Kenobi is a derivative of the Seeker design and will communicate between Cygnus and Seeker and store data for post-mission downlink. Seeker and Kenobi have launched inside a NanoRacks External CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD-E) attached to the NG-11 Cygnus ISS resupply vehicle and will operate after Cygnus departs ISS and moves to a safe altitude. Operations will last approximately 30 minutes and will consist of basic vehicle maneuvers while capturing high-resolution still images. With any remaining time and propellant, Seeker will demonstrate additional safety capabilities and maneuvers required for operations around a crewed spacecraft. The Seeker project utilized the Class IE process that allows for streamlined flight hardware development and increased mission risk tolerance.\n\n\n\n\n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190029188, "endDate": "2019-08-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "b20e79b68a5d47e69d83ea9aee17c8e1", "id": "a000310f39304bc3ad93f1a567e163e3"}], "name": "Annual Conference on Small Satellites", "location": "Logan, UT", "id": "b20e79b68a5d47e69d83ea9aee17c8e1", "startDate": "2019-08-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190029188, "id": "6090ab6c4ee24f1c9150ad0863cfc42b", "publicationDate": "2019-08-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190029188.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190029188/downloads/20190029188.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190029188/downloads/20190029188.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190029188/downloads/20190029188.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
