Examples of current design tasks will be used to emphasize the areas where new or expanded VLSI CAD tools are needed. To provide a basis for projecting the future of VLSI tools, a brief history of the evolution of VLSI design software and hardware platforms is presented. The role of design methodology is considered with respect to the anticipated scale of future VLSI design projects. Future requirements of design verification and manufacturing testing are projected based on the challenge of surviving in a competitive market. Examples of VLSI tools reflect the author's involvement on VLSI design teams developing integrated circuits for disk memory and other computer peripherals for the last eight years.", "title": "Next generation VLSI tools", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T15:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940004321, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gibson, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Hewlett-Packard Co.", "location": "Boise, ID, United States"}}, "id": "c2358bff1fa14aedb63af385fc535214"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940004321, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940004321, "id": "87e02901e58f4f2fa6d64cd23c5ad0d1", "publicationName": "Idaho Univ., The First NASA Symposium on VLSI Design", "publicationDate": "1990-01-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940004319, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA SERC 1990 Symposium on VLSI Design", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
