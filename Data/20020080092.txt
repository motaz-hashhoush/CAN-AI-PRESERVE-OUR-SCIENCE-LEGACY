b'Ice Protection\n\nI\n\nce buildup -or "accretion" - on the wings of\naircraft represents a\npotential source of accidents\nor damage to airplanes.\nTherefore any innovation that\npromises greater deicing efficiency is of special interest to\nairline operators, the military\nservices, aircraft manufacturers and public safety\nagencies.\nNow commercially available is a new ice removal\nsystem designed to overcome\nsome of the limitations of\nexisting electro-thermal\ndeicers. Originally developed\nby Ames Research Center,\nthe system was refined by\nDNE Technologies, Inc.,\nWallingford, Connecticut and\nis being marketed by DNE\nunder a NASA license.\nThe system employs a\ntechnique known a s expulsive\nice shedding. Expulsive separation "blankets" are applied to an aerodynamic surface\nsubject to ice accretion - a wing, helicopter rotor or\nengine inlet, for example - and the blankets protect the\nsurface by mechanically expelling the ice periodically.\nThe force to expel the ice is developed magnetically by\npassing a strong direct current pulse through conductors\nembedded in the blanket; this causes an explosive expansion of the blanket that ejects the ice on the aerodynamic\nsurface.\n"Expulsive blankets have the ability to cleanly shed\nall forms of meteorological ice at virtually any thickness,"\nDNE officials say. The system has been proved effective\nin a variety of icing tunnels and in natural icing conditions. The sequential photos show a DNE tunnel test of\nthe expulsive separation system on an ice-covered aircraft wing segment. In the top photo, the system has\n\njust been activated; in the lower photo, taken less than\na millisecond later, most of the ice has been pulverized\nand ejected.\nDNE substantially modified the Ames technology to\nmake the system commercially viable. Among refinements are extended service life, achieved by controlling\ninternal conductor deformation in a manner that virtually\neliminates conductor metal fatigue; improvement of blanket efficiency by better conversion of electrical energy to\nmechanical energy; blanket level redundancy; and a sharp\nreduction in the size and weight of the blanket\'s electronic\ncontrollers. The laboratory development system of 1988\nneeded a power supply that weighed nearly 40 pounds for\neight square feet of blanket; the advanced system\'s power\nsupply drives 16 square feet of blanket and weighs less\nthan 10 pounds.\n\n'
