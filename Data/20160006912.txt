on extended\nmissions; conventional approach is to bring all spares that may fail, but that results in significant\nmass of spares being manifested that do not end up being used\n\xe2\x80\xa2 On-demand fabrication enables producing only spares needed during missions\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This approach has been successfully demonstrated in-theater: Army Mobile Parts Hospital buildas-you-go paradigm
