We also evaluate the effects of OMI Row\n\n72\n\nanomaly (RA) on the retrieval by dividing the data set into before and after the occurrence of\n\n73\n\nserious OMI RA, i.e., pre-RA (2004-2008) and post-RA (2009-2014). The retrieval shows good\n\n74\n\nagreement with ozonesondes in the tropics and mid-latitudes and for pressure < ~50 hPa in the\n\n75\n\nhigh latitudes. It demonstrates clear improvement over the a priori down to the lower troposphere\n\n76\n\nin the tropics and down to an average of ~550 (300) hPa at middle (high latitudes). In the tropics\n\n77\n\nand mid-latitudes, the profile mean biases (MBs) are less than 6%, and the standard deviations\n\n78\n\n(SDs) range from 5-10% for pressure < ~50 hPa to less than 18% (27%) in the tropics (mid-\n\n79\n\nlatitudes) for pressure > ~50 hPa after applying OMI averaging kernels to ozonesonde data. The\n\n80\n\nMBs of the stratospheric ozone column (SOC, the ozone column from the tropopause pressure to\n\n81\n\nthe ozonesonde burst pressure) are within 2% with SDs of < 5% and the MBs of the tropospheric\n\n82\n\nozone column (TOC) are within 6% with SDs of 15%. In the high latitudes, the profile MBs are\n\n83\n\nwithin 10% with SDs of 5-15% for pressure < ~50 hPa, but increase to 30% with SDs as great as\n\n84\n\n40% for pressure > ~50 hPa. The SOC MBs increase up to 3% with SDs as great as 6% and the\n\n85\n\nTOC SDs increase up to 30%. The comparison generally degrades at larger solar-zenith angles\n\n86\n\n(SZA) due to weaker signals and additional sources of error, leading to worse performance at\n\n87\n\nhigh latitudes and during the mid-latitude winter. Agreement also degrades with increasing\n\n88\n\ncloudiness for pressure > ~100 hPa and varies with cross-track position, especially with large\n\n89\n\nMBs and SDs at extreme off-nadir positions. In the tropics and mid-latitudes, the post-RA\n\n90\n\ncomparison is considerably worse with larger SDs reaching 2% in the stratosphere and 8% in the\n\n91\n\ntroposphere and up to 6% in TOC. There are systematic differences that vary with latitude\n\n92\n\ncompared to the pre-RA comparison. The retrieval comparison demonstrates good long-term\n\n93\n\nstability during the pre-RA period, but exhibits a statistically significant trend of 0.14-0.7%/year\n\n94\n\nfor pressure < ~ 80 hPa, 0.7 DU/year in SOC and -0.33 DU/year in TOC during the post-RA\n\n95\n\nperiod. The spatiotemporal variation of retrieval performance suggests the need to improve\n\n96\n\nOMI\xe2\x80\x99s radiometric calibration especially during the post-RA period to maintain the long-term\n\n97\n\nstability and reduce the latitude/season/SZA and cross-track dependence of retrieval quality.\n4\n\n98\n\n1 Introduction\n\n99\n\nThe Dutch-Finnish built Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board the NASA Aura satellite\n\n100\n\nhas been making useful measurements of trace gases including ozone and aerosols since October\n\n101\n\n2004. There are various retrieval algorithms to retrieve ozone profile and/or total ozone from\n\n102\n\nOMI data (Bak et al., 2015), including two independent operational total ozone algorithms\n\n103\n\n(Bhartia and Wellemeyer, 2002; Veefkind et al., 2006) and two ozone profile algorithms. Of the\n\n104\n\ntwo ozone profile algorithms, one is the operational algorithm (OMO3PR) developed at KNMI\n\n105\n\n(van Oss et al., 2001), and the other one is a research algorithm developed at Smithsonian\n\n106\n\nAstrophysical Observatory (SAO) by (Liu et al., 2010b). Both algorithms retrieve ozone profile\n\n107\n\nfrom the spectral region 270-330 nm using the optimal estimation method, but they differ\n\n108\n\nsignificantly in implementation details including radiometric calibration, radiative transfer model\n\n109\n\nsimulation, a priori constraint, retrieval grids, and additional retrieval parameters. The SAO\n\n110\n\nozone profile retrieval algorithm was initially developed for Global Ozone Monitoring\n\n111\n\nExperiment (GOME) data and was adapted to OMI data (Liu et al., 2010b). Total ozone column\n\n112\n\n(OC), Stratospheric Ozone Column (SOC) and Tropospheric Ozone Column (TOC) can be\n\n113\n\ndirectly derived from the retrieved ozone profile with retrieval errors in the range of a few\n\n114\n\nDobson Units (DU) (Liu et al., 2006b; Liu et al., 2010a). This algorithm has been put into\n\n115\n\nproduction in the OMI Science Investigator-led Processing System (SIPS), processing the entire\n\n116\n\nOMI data record with approximately one-month delay. The ozone profile product titled\n\n117\n\nPROFOZ\n\n118\n\n(https://avdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.php?site=1389025893&id=74). This long-term ozone profile\n\n119\n\nproduct, with high spatial resolution and daily global coverage, constitutes a useful dataset to\n\n120\n\nstudy the spatial and temporal distribution of ozone.\n\n121\n\nTo effectively use the retrieval dataset, it is necessary to evaluate and understand its retrieval\n\n122\n\nquality and long-term performance. Although validation of the ozone profile product (mostly\n\n123\n\nearlier versions) has been partially performed against aircraft, ozonesonde, and Microwave Limb\n\n124\n\nSounder (MLS) data, these evaluations are limited to certain time periods and/or spatial region\n\n125\n\nand/or to only portion of the product (e.g., total ozone columns (OC) or TOC only) (Bak et al.,\n\n126\n\n2013a; Hayashida et al., 2015; Lal et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2010a; Liu et al., 2010b; Pittman et al.,\n\n127\n\n2009; Sellitto et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2007; Ziemke et al., 2014).\n\nis\n\npublicly\n\navailable\n\nat\n\nthe\n\nAura\n\n5\n\nValidation\n\nData\n\nCenter\n\n(AVDC)\n\n128\n\nAdditionally, the quality of ozone profile retrievals is very sensitive to the signal to noise ratio\n\n129\n\n(SNR) of the radiance measurements as well as their radiometric calibration, which may degrade\n\n130\n\nover time as shown in GOME and GOME-2 retrievals (Cai et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2007).\n\n131\n\nAlthough OMI\xe2\x80\x99s optical degradation is remarkably small to within 1-2% over the years, the SNR\n\n132\n\nand the number of good spectral pixels (not flagged as bad/hot pixels) have been gradually\n\n133\n\ndecreasing over the years due to the expected CCD degradation (Claas, 2014). Furthermore, the\n\n134\n\noccurrence of RA, which affects level 1b data at all wavelengths for particular viewing directions\n\n135\n\nor cross-track positions and likely due to blocking objects in the optical path, started in June\n\n136\n\n2007 affecting a few positions. This effect abruptly worsened in January 2009 affecting ~1/3 of\n\n137\n\nthe cross-track positions (Kroon et al., 2011). The impacts of RA not only evolve with time but\n\n138\n\nalso vary over the duration of an orbit. Analysis indicates that radiances in the UV1 channels\n\n139\n\n(shorter than ~310 nm) used in our retrievals might have been affected at all positions (Personal\n\n140\n\ncommunication with S. Marchenko) and are not adequately flagged for RA. Therefore, we need\n\n141\n\nto evaluate the impacts of instrument degradation and especially row anomaly on the temporal\n\n142\n\nperformance of our ozone profile product. Currently, we are planning an update of the ozone\n\n143\n\nprofile algorithm to maintain the long-term consistency of the product. The update will include\n\n144\n\nempirical correction of systematic errors caused by the instrument degradation and row anomaly\n\n145\n\nas a function of time. Such correction also requires us to evaluate the long-term retrieval quality\n\n146\n\nof our product.\n\n147\n\nTo understand retrieval quality and the resulting spatial and temporal performance of our OMI\n\n148\n\nproduct, we evaluate our data from October 2004 through December 2014 against available\n\n149\n\nozonesonde and MLS observations, respectively, in two papers. This paper evaluates our ozone\n\n150\n\nproduct including both ozone profiles and stratospheric and tropospheric ozone columns using\n\n151\n\nozonesonde observations with a focus on retrieval quality in the troposphere. More than 27,000\n\n152\n\nozonesonde profiles from both regular ozonesonde stations and field campaigns are used in this\n\n153\n\nstudy to provide a comprehensive and global assessment of the long-term quality of our OMI\n\n154\n\nozone product. This paper is followed by the validation against collocated MLS data with a focus\n\n155\n\non the retrieval quality in the stratosphere (Huang et al., 2017), also submitted to this special\n\n156\n\nissue).\n\n6\n\n157\n\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes OMI retrievals and ozonesonde data. The\n\n158\n\nvalidation methodology is introduced in Section 3. Section 4 presents results, analysis and\n\n159\n\ndiscussions regarding the OMI and ozonesonde comparisons. Section 5 summarizes and\n\n160\n\nconcludes this study.\n\n161\n\n2 OMI and Ozonesonde Datasets\n\n162\n\n2.1 OMI and OMI Ozone Profile Retrievals\n\n163\n\nOMI is a Dutch-Finnish built nadir-viewing pushbroom UV/visible instrument aboard the NASA\n\n164\n\nEarth Observing System (EOS) Aura satellite that was launched into a sun-synchronous orbit in\n\n165\n\nJuly 2004. It measures backscattered radiances in three channels covering the 270-500 nm\n\n166\n\nwavelength range (UV1: 270-310 nm, UV2: 310-365 nm, visible: 350-500 nm) at spectral\n\n167\n\nresolutions of 0.42-0.63 nm (Levelt et al., 2006). Measurements across the track are binned to\n\n168\n\n60 positions for UV2 and visible channels, 30 positions for the UV1 channels due to the weaker\n\n169\n\nsignals. This results in daily global coverage with a nadir spatial resolution of 13 km \xc3\x97 24 km\n\n170\n\n(along \xc3\x97 across track) for UV2 and visible channels, and 13 km \xc3\x97 48 km for the UV1 channel.\n\n171\n\nThe SAO OMI ozone profile algorithm was adapted from the GOME ozone profile algorithm\n\n172\n\n(Liu et al., 2005) to OMI and was initially described in detail in Liu et al. (2010b). Profiles of\n\n173\n\npartial ozone columns are retrieved at 24 layers, ~2.5 km for each layer, from the surface to ~60\n\n174\n\nkm using OMI radiance spectra in the spectral region 270-330 nm with the optimal estimation\n\n175\n\ntechnique. In addition to the OC, SOC and TOC can be directly derived from the retrieved ozone\n\n176\n\nprofile with the use of tropopause (defined based on the lapse rate) from the daily National\n\n177\n\nCenter for Environmental Protection (NCEP) reanalysis data. The retrievals are constrained with\n\n178\n\nmonth- and latitude-dependent climatological a priori profiles derived from 15-year ozonesonde\n\n179\n\nand SAGE/MLS data (McPeters et al., 2007) with considerations of OMI random-noise errors.\n\n180\n\nOMI radiances are pre-calibrated based on two days of average radiance differences in the\n\n181\n\ntropics between OMI observations and simulations with zonal mean MLS data for pressure less\n\n182\n\nthan 215 hPa and climatological ozone profile for pressure greater than 215 hPa. This \xe2\x80\x9csoft\n\n183\n\ncalibration\xe2\x80\x9d varies with wavelength and cross-track positions but does not depend on space and\n\n184\n\ntime.\n7\n\n185\n\nThe current algorithm of our SAO OMI ozone product that is used in this paper was briefly\n\n186\n\ndescribed in Kim et al. (2013). The radiative transfer calculations have been improved through\n\n187\n\nthe convolution of simulated radiance spectra at high resolutions rather than effective cross\n\n188\n\nsections, which is done by interpolation from calculation at selected wavelengths assisted by\n\n189\n\nweighting function. In addition, four spatial pixels along the track are coadded to speed up\n\n190\n\nproduction processes at a nadir spatial resolution of 52 km \xc3\x97 48 km. Meanwhile, minimum\n\n191\n\nmeasurement errors of 0.4% and 0.2% are imposed in the spectral ranges 270-300 nm and 300-\n\n192\n\n330 nm, respectively, to stabilize the retrievals. The use of floor errors typically reduces the\n\n193\n\nDegree of Freedom for Signals (DFS) and increases retrieval errors. Compared to the initial\n\n194\n\nretrievals, the average total, stratospheric, and tropospheric DFS decrease by 0.49, 0.27, and\n\n195\n\n0.22, respectively, and the mean retrieval errors in OC, SOC, and TOC increase by 0.6, 0.5, and\n\n196\n\n1.2 DU, respectively. The corresponding changes to the retrievals are generally within retrieval\n\n197\n\nuncertainties except for a systematic increase in tropospheric ozone at SZA larger than ~75\xc2\xb0,\n\n198\n\nwhere the TOC increases to ~12 DU. Validation against ozonesonde data indicates that this TOC\n\n199\n\nincrease at large SZA makes the retrieval worse. Therefore retrieved tropospheric ozone at such\n\n200\n\nlarge SZA should not be used, but the retrieved total ozone still shows good quality (Bak et al.,\n\n201\n\n2015).\n\n202\n\nFor current products, retrievals contain ~5.5-7.4 DFS, with 4.6-7.3 in the stratosphere and 0-1.2\n\n203\n\nin the troposphere. Vertical resolution varies generally from 7\xe2\x80\x9311 km in the stratosphere to 10\xe2\x80\x93\n\n204\n\n14 km in the troposphere, when there is adequate retrieval sensitivity to the tropospheric ozone.\n\n205\n\nRetrieval random-noise errors (i.e., precisions) typically range from 0.6\xe2\x80\x932.5 % in the middle\n\n206\n\nstratosphere to approximately 12% in the lower stratosphere and troposphere. The solution\n\n207\n\nerrors, dominated by smoothing errors, vary generally from 1-7% in the middle stratosphere to 7-\n\n208\n\n38% in the troposphere. The solution errors in the integrated OC, SOC, and TOC are typically in\n\n209\n\nthe few DU range. Errors caused by the forward model and forward model parameter\n\n210\n\nassumptions are generally much smaller than the smoothing error (Liu et al., 2005). The main\n\n211\n\nsources of these errors include systematic errors in temperature and cloud-top pressure.\n\n212\n\nSystematic measurement errors are the most difficult to estimate, mostly due to lack of full\n\n213\n\nunderstanding of the OMI instrument calibration.\n\n8\n\n214\n\nCertain cross track positions in OMI data have been affected by RA since June 2007 (Kroon et\n\n215\n\nal., 2011). Loose thermal insulating material in front of the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s entrance slit is believed\n\n216\n\nto block and scatter light, causing measurement error. The anomaly affects radiance\n\n217\n\nmeasurements at all wavelengths for specific cross-track viewing directions that are imaged to\n\n218\n\nCCD rows. Initially, the anomaly only affected a few rows. But since January 2009, the anomaly\n\n219\n\nhas spread to other rows and shifted with time. The RA also shows slight differences among\n\n220\n\ndifferent spectral channels, and varies during the duration of an orbit. Pixels affected by the RA\n\n221\n\nare flagged in the level 1b data. The science team suggested that they are not be used in research.\n\n222\n\nFor data before 2009, the RA flagging is not applied in the processing. Pixels seriously affected\n\n223\n\nby RA will typically show enhanced fitting residuals. The algorithm was updated to use RA\n\n224\n\nflagging in the UV1 channel and was used to process the data starting from 2009. If a pixel is\n\n225\n\nflagged as a row anomaly then it is subsequently not retrieved to speed up the processing except\n\n226\n\nthat the cross-track position 24 is still retrieved due to reasonably good fitting. It should be noted\n\n227\n\nthat the retrieval quality of those non-flagged pixels may still be affected by the RA, because of\n\n228\n\nthe different RA flagging in the UV1 and UV2, the lack of RA flagging before 2009 and\n\n229\n\ninadequacy of the RA flagging.\n\n230\n\nTo screen out OMI profiles for validation, we only use OMI ozone profiles meeting the\n\n231\n\nfollowing criteria based on three filtering parameters: 1) nearly clear-sky scenes with effective\n\n232\n\ncloud fraction less than 0.3; 2) cross track positions between 4 and 27, due to the relatively worse\n\n233\n\nquality and much larger footprint size of the off-nadir pixels beyond this range; 3) SZA should\n\n234\n\nbe less than 75\xc2\xb0 due to very limited retrieval sensitivity to tropospheric ozone and the\n\n235\n\naforementioned positive biases. The selection and justification of these criteria will be discussed\n\n236\n\nin Sects. 2.1.2-4.1.4, in which we will use all OMI pixels of each filtering parameter when\n\n237\n\nevaluating retrieval quality as a function of that specific parameter. The fitting quality of each\n\n238\n\nretrieval is shown in the fitting RMS (root mean square of the fitting residuals relative to the\n\n239\n\nassumed measurement errors). The mean fitting RMS including both UV1 and UV2 channels has\n\n240\n\nbeen increasing with time as shown in Figure 1. This is primarily due to the increase of fitting\n\n241\n\nresiduals in UV1 caused by the instrument degradation and RA since the fitting residuals of UV2\n\n242\n\nonly slightly increase with time. As aforementioned, the retrieval information of stratospheric\n\n243\n\nand tropospheric ozone mainly comes from UV1 and UV2, respectively. Consequently, retrievals\n9\n\n244\n\nin the troposphere, the focus of this paper, are less impacted by the increasing fitting RMS.\n\n245\n\nHowever, to apply consistent filtering in validation against both ozonesonde in this study and\n\n246\n\nMLS data in the companion paper (Huang et al., 2017), we set the RMS threshold based on the\n\n247\n\noverall fitting RMS and select retrievals with fitting RMS smaller than the sum of monthly mean\n\n248\n\nRMS and its 2\xcf\x83 (i.e., Standard Deviations (SDs) of fitting RMS).\n\n249\n\n2.2 Ozonesondes\n\n250\n\nThe balloon-borne ozonesonde is a well-established technique to observe the ozone profile from\n\n251\n\nthe surface to ~35 km with vertical resolution of ~100-150 m and approximately 3-5% precision\n\n252\n\nand 5-10% accuracy (Deshler et al., 2008; Johnson, 2002; Komhyr, 1986; Komhyr et al., 1995;\n\n253\n\nSmit et al., 2007). Ozonesonde data have been widely used in the studies of stratospheric ozone,\n\n254\n\nclimate change, tropospheric ozone and air quality, as well as the validation of satellite\n\n255\n\nobservations (Huang et al., 2015; Kivi et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2011).\n\n256\n\nHowever, the accuracy of ozonesonde observations depends on data processing technique, sensor\n\n257\n\nsolution, and instrument type and other factors. Consequently, station-to-station biases may\n\n258\n\noccur in ozonesonde measurements and could be as great as 10% (Thompson et al., 2007c;\n\n259\n\nWorden et al., 2007).\n\n260\n\nA decade (2004-2014) of global ozonesonde data with locations shown in Figure 2, are utilized\n\n261\n\nin this study to validate our OMI ozone profile product. Most of our ozonesonde data were\n\n262\n\nobtained from the Aura Validation Data Center (AVDC) archive. It contains routine launches\n\n263\n\nfrom ozonesonde stations, mostly weekly and occasionally 2-3 times a week at some stations. It\n\n264\n\nalso collects launches from field campaigns, for instance, IONS 06 (INTEX-B Ozone Network\n\n265\n\nStudy\n\n266\n\n(http://croc.gsfc.nasa.gov/arcions/) (Tarasick et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2008). Data not\n\n267\n\navailable at AVDC are obtained from other archives such as the World Ozone and Ultraviolet\n\n268\n\nRadiation Data Center (WOUDC) (http://woudc.org/), the Southern Hemisphere Additional\n\n269\n\nOzonesondes (SHADOZ) (Thompson et al., 2007a; Thompson et al., 2007b), as well as archives\n\n270\n\nof recent field campaigns including DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface\n\n271\n\nConditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality,\n\n272\n\nhttp://discover-aq.larc.nasa.gov/) (Thompson et al., 2015) and SEACR4S (Studies of Emissions\n\n2006),\n\nARCIONS\n\n(Arctic\n\nIntensive\n\n10\n\nOzonesonde\n\nNetwork\n\nStudy)\n\n273\n\nand Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys,\n\n274\n\nhttps://espo.nasa.gov/home/seac4rs) (Toon et al., 2016). Almost all of the ozonesonde data in\n\n275\n\nthis study were obtained from electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesondes, which is\n\n276\n\nbased on the oxidation reaction of ozone with potassium iodide (KI) in solution. The exceptions\n\n277\n\nare Hohenpeissenberg station in Germany that uses Brewer-Mast (BM) ozonesondes, the New\n\n278\n\nDelhi, Poona, and Trivandrum stations that use Indian ozonesondes, and four Japanese stations\n\n279\n\n(i.e., Sapporo, Tsukuba, Naha and Syowa) that switched from KC ozonesondes to ECC\n\n280\n\nozonesondes during late 2008 and early 2010. These types of ozonesondes have been reported to\n\n281\n\nhave larger uncertainties than ECC ozonesondes (Hassler et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2013; WMO,\n\n282\n\n1998).\n\n283\n\nTo avoid using anomalous profiles, we screen out ozonesondes that burst at pressure exceeding\n\n284\n\n200 hPa, ozone profiles with gaps greater than 3 km, more than 80 DU TOC or less than 100 DU\n\n285\n\nSOC. In the SOC comparison, we also filter measurements that do not reach 12 hPa. Some\n\n286\n\nozonesonde data used in this paper (e.g. WOUDC data) are provided with a correction factor\n\n287\n\n(CF) derived by normalizing the integrated ozone column (appended with ozone climatology\n\n288\n\nabove burst altitude) to the coincident total ozone column measured by a Dobson or Brewer\n\n289\n\ninstrument to account for uncertainties mainly from the pump efficiency especially near the top\n\n290\n\nof the profiles. The CF is also included in our screening processes. If the CF is available, we\n\n291\n\nselect ozonesonde profiles with the CF in the range of 0.85 to 1.15 to filter profiles that require\n\n292\n\ntoo much correction, and apply the correction. Finally, a small number of obviously erroneous\n\n293\n\nprofiles are visually examined and rejected.\n\n294\n\n3 Comparison Methodology\n\n295\n\nPrevious studies on the validation of satellite observations used a range of coincidence criteria.\n\n296\n\nWang et al. (2011) set a 100 km radius and 3 hour time difference as coincidence criteria. Kroon\n\n297\n\net al. (2011) applied coincidence criteria of \xc2\xb1 0.5\xc2\xb0 for both latitude and longitude and 12 hours.\n\n298\n\nIn this paper, we determine our coincident criteria based on the balance between finding most\n\n299\n\ncoincident OMI/ozonesonde pairs to minimize differences due to spatiotemporal samplings and\n\n300\n\nfinding a sufficient number of pairs for statistical analysis. For each screened ozonesonde profile,\n\n301\n\nwe first select all filtered OMI data within \xc2\xb11\xc2\xb0 latitude, \xc2\xb13\xc2\xb0 longitude and \xc2\xb1 6 hours and then\n11\n\n302\n\nfind the nearest OMI retrieval within 100 km from the ozonesonde station to perform the\n\n303\n\nvalidation on the individual profile basis.\n\n304\n\nOzonesondes have much finer vertical resolution than OMI retrievals. To account for the\n\n305\n\ndifferent resolutions, ozonesonde profiles are first integrated into the corresponding OMI vertical\n\n306\n\ngrids and then degraded to the OMI vertical resolution by using the OMI retrieval Averaging\n\n307\n\nKernels (AKs) and a priori ozone profile based on the following equation:\n\n308\n\n310\n\nwhere x is the ozonesonde profile integrated into the OMI grid, \xef\xbf\xbd is the retrieved ozone profile if\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\n\n311\n\nprofile. We refer to this retrieval as \xe2\x80\x9cconvolved ozonesonde profile\xe2\x80\x9d, which is a reconstruction of\n\n312\n\nozonesonde profile with OMI retrieval vertical resolution and sensitivity. Missing ozone profiles\n\n313\n\nabove ozonesonde burst altitude are filled with OMI retrievals. The convolution process\n\n314\n\nessentially removes OMI smoothing errors and the impacts of a priori from the comparison so\n\n315\n\nthat OMI/ozonesonde differences are mainly due to OMI/ozonesonde measurement precision,\n\n316\n\nspatiotemporal sampling differences and other errors. However, in the regions and altitudes\n\n317\n\nwhere OMI has low retrieval sensitivity, the comparisons can show good agreement because\n\n318\n\nboth the retrieval and convolved ozonesonde approach the a priori profile. To overcome the\n\n319\n\nlimitation of such a comparison, we also compare with unconvolved ozonesonde profiles since it\n\n320\n\nindicates how well the retrievals can represent the actual ozonesonde observations (i.e.,\n\n321\n\nsmoothing errors are included as part of retrieval errors). In addition, we also compare OMI a\n\n322\n\npriori and convolved/unconvolved ozonesonde profiles to indicate the retrieval improvement\n\n323\n\nover the a priori.\n\n324\n\nFor consistent calculations of TOC and SOC from the OMI/ozonesonde data, the tropopause\n\n325\n\npressure included in the OMI retrieval and ozonesonde burst pressure (required to be less than 12\n\n326\n\nhPa or above ~30 km) are used as the proper boundaries. The TOC is integrated from the surface\n\n327\n\nto the tropopause. And the SOC is not the total stratospheric ozone column, but the ozone\n\n328\n\ncolumn integrated from the tropopause pressure to the ozonesonde burst pressure.\n\n329\n\nThe relative profile difference is calculated as (OMI- Sonde) / OMI a priori \xc3\x97100% in the present\n\n330\n\ncomparison with ozonesonde and with MLS in the companion paper. Choosing OMI a priori\n\n309\n\n\xef\xbf\xbd = \xf0\x9d\x92\x99\xf0\x9d\x92\x99 \xf0\x9d\x92\x82\xf0\x9d\x92\x82 + \xf0\x9d\x91\xa8\xf0\x9d\x91\xa8(\xf0\x9d\x92\x99\xf0\x9d\x92\x99 \xe2\x88\x92 \xf0\x9d\x92\x99\xf0\x9d\x92\x99 \xf0\x9d\x92\x82\xf0\x9d\x92\x82 ),\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x99\xf0\x9d\x92\x99\n\n(1)\n\nthe ozonesonde is observed by OMI, A is the OMI AK matrix, and \xf0\x9d\x91\xa5\xf0\x9d\x91\xa5 \xf0\x9d\x91\x8e\xf0\x9d\x91\x8e is the OMI a priori ozone\n\n12\n\n331\n\nrather than MLS/ozonesonde is to avoid unrealistic statistics skewed by extremely small values\n\n332\n\nin the reference data especially in the MLS retrievals of upper troposphere and lower\n\n333\n\nstratosphere ozone (Liu et al., 2010a). Unlike the profile comparison, ozonesonde/OMI\n\n334\n\nSOC/TOC values are used in the denominator in the computation of relative difference. To\n\n335\n\nexclude remaining extreme outliers in the comparison statistics, values that are exceeding 3\xcf\x83\n\n336\n\nfrom the mean differences are filtered.\n\n337\n\nAfter applying the OMI/ozone filtering and coincident criteria, approximately 10,500\n\n338\n\nozonesonde profiles are used in the validation. We performed the comparison for five latitude\n\n339\n\nbands: northern high latitudes (60\xc2\xb0 N-90\xc2\xb0 N), northern mid-latitudes (30\xc2\xb0 N-60\xc2\xb0 N), tropics (30\xc2\xb0\n\n340\n\nS-30\xc2\xb0 N), southern mid-latitudes (60\xc2\xb0 S-30\xc2\xb0 S), and southern high latitudes (90\xc2\xb0 S-60\xc2\xb0 S) to\n\n341\n\nunderstand the latitudinal variation of the retrieval performance. We investigated the seasonal\n\n342\n\nvariations of the comparisons mainly at northern mid-latitudes where ozone retrieval shows\n\n343\n\ndistinct seasonality and there are adequate coincidence pairs. To investigate the RA impacts on\n\n344\n\nOMI retrievals, we contrasted the comparison before (2004-2008, i.e., pre-RA) and after (2009-\n\n345\n\n2014, i.e., post-RA). Although we filter OMI data based on cloud fraction, cross-track position,\n\n346\n\nand SZA in the final evaluation of our retrievals against ozonesonde observations as shown in\n\n347\n\nSect. 4.1.1., we conduct the comparison as a function of these parameters using coincidences at\n\n348\n\nall latitude bands to show how these parameters affect the retrieval quality as shown in the Sects.\n\n349\n\n4.1.2 \xe2\x80\x93 4.1.4. In these evaluations, the filtering of OMI data based on cloud fraction, cross-track\n\n350\n\nposition, and SZA are switched off, respectively. Approximately 15,000 additional ozonesonde\n\n351\n\nprofiles are used in this extended evaluation. To evaluate the long-term performance of our\n\n352\n\nozone profile retrievals, we analyze the monthly mean biases (MBs) of the OMI/ozonesonde\n\n353\n\ndifferences as a function of time using coincidences in the 60\xc2\xb0 S-60\xc2\xb0 N region and then derive a\n\n354\n\nlinear trends over the entire period as well as the pre-RA and post-RA periods.\n\n13\n\n355\n\n4 Results and Discussions\n\n356\n\n4.1 Comparison of Ozonesonde and OMI profiles\n\n357\n\n4.1.1\n\n358\n\nComparisons of ozone profiles between OMI/a priori and ozonesondes with and without\n\n359\n\napplying OMI AKs for the 10-year period (2004-2014) are shown in the left panels of Figure 3.\n\n360\n\nThe MBs and SDs vary spatially with altitude and latitude. Vertically, the SD typically\n\n361\n\nmaximizes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) in all latitude bands due to\n\n362\n\nsignificant ozone variability and a priori uncertainty. Bak et al. (2013b) showed that the use of\n\n363\n\nTropopause-Based (TB) ozone profile climatology with NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS)\n\n364\n\ndaily tropopause pressure can significantly improve the a priori, and eventually reduce the\n\n365\n\nretrieval uncertainty. Consequently, the SDs of OMI/sonde differences in the UTLS at mid- and\n\n366\n\nhigh-latitudes can be reduced through reducing the retrieval uncertainties in a future version of\n\n367\n\nthe algorithm that uses the TB climatology. Latitudinally, the agreement is better in the tropics\n\n368\n\nand becomes worse at higher latitudes. The patterns are generally similar in the northern and\n\n369\n\nsouthern hemispheres. The MBs between OMI and ozonesonde are within ~6% with AKs and\n\n370\n\n10% without AKs in the tropics and the middle latitudes. Large changes in the biases between\n\n371\n\nwith and without AKs occur in the tropical troposphere where the bias differences reach 10%.\n\n372\n\nThe MBs increase to 20-30% at high latitudes consistently with large oscillation from ~-20-30%\n\n373\n\nat ~300 hPa to +20% near the surface both with and without the application of AKs. At pressure\n\n374\n\n< 50 hPa, the SDs for comparisons with OMI AKs are typically 5-10% at all latitudes except for\n\n375\n\nthe 90\xc2\xb0 S-60\xc2\xb0 S region. For pressure > 50 hPa, the SDs are within 18% and 27% in the tropics\n\n376\n\nand middle-latitudes, respectively, but increase to 40% at higher latitudes. The SDs for\n\n377\n\ncomparison without applying OMI AKs, i.e., including OMI smoothing errors in the\n\n378\n\nOMI/ozonesonde differences, typically increase up to 5% for pressure < 50 hPa, but increase up\n\n379\n\nto 15-20% for pressure > ~50hPa. The smoothing errors derived from root square differences of\n\n380\n\nthe MBs with and without OMI AKs are generally consistent with the retrieval estimate from the\n\n381\n\noptimal estimation.\n\nOzone Profile Differences\n\n14\n\n382\n\nThe improvements of OMI over the climatological (a priori) profiles can be reflected in the\n\n383\n\nreduction of MBs and SDs in the comparisons between ozonesondes and OMI retrievals, and\n\n384\n\nbetween ozonesondes and a priori. The retrieval improvements in the MBs are clearly shown in\n\n385\n\nthe tropics and at ~ 100 hPa pressure in the middle latitudes. At high latitudes, the MBs and\n\n386\n\ncorresponding oscillations in the troposphere are much larger than these in the a priori\n\n387\n\ncomparison, suggesting that these large biases are mainly caused by other systematic\n\n388\n\nmeasurements errors at high latitudes (larger SZAs and thus weaker signals). As can be seen\n\n389\n\nfrom the reduction of SDs, OMI retrievals show clear improvements over the a priori at pressure\n\n390\n\n< 300 hPa. For pressure > 300 hPa, the retrieval improvements vary with latitudes. There are\n\n391\n\nconsistent retrieval improvements throughout the surface - 300hPa layer in the tropics and only\n\n392\n\nthe 550 - 300 hPa layer at middle latitude, while there is no retrieval improvement over the a\n\n393\n\npriori for > 300 hPa at high latitudes. The failure to improve the retrieval over a priori in part of\n\n394\n\nthe troposphere at middle and high latitudes is caused by several factors. They are the inherent\n\n395\n\nreduction in retrieval sensitivity to lower altitudes at larger SZAs as a result of reduced photon\n\n396\n\npenetration into the atmosphere, unrealized retrieval sensitivity arising from retrieval\n\n397\n\ninterferences with other parameters (e.g., surface albedo) as discussed in Liu et al. (2010b) and\n\n398\n\nthe use of floor-noise of 0.2% that underestimates the actual OMI measurement SNR. In\n\n399\n\naddition, the a priori ozone error in the climatology is quite small since the SDs of the\n\n400\n\ndifferences between the a priori and ozonesonde without AKs are typically less than 20% in the\n\n401\n\nlower troposphere for middle and high latitudes, which also makes it more difficult to improve\n\n402\n\nover the a priori comparison.\n\n403\n\nThe right column of Figure 3 shows the comparisons between OMI retrievals and ozonesondes\n\n404\n\nconvolved with OMI AKs in the pre-RA and post-RA periods, respectively. In the tropics and\n\n405\n\nmid-latitudes, the pre-RA comparison is better than the post-RA comparison, with SDs smaller\n\n406\n\nby up to ~8% at most altitudes especially in the troposphere. The pre-RA comparison also shows\n\n407\n\nsmaller biases near ~300 hPa at middle latitudes while the post-RA comparison exhibits negative\n\n408\n\nbiases reaching 8-12%.\n\n409\n\nimprovement during the post-RA period. The pre-RA comparison shows slightly smaller SDs at\n\n410\n\nmost altitudes and smaller negative biases by 10% around 300 hPa in the northern high latitudes,\n\n411\n\nand smaller positive biases by 20% near the surface in the southern high latitudes. The worse\n\nAt high latitudes, the pre-RA period does not show persistent\n\n15\n\n412\n\nresults during the post-RA period are caused by increasingly noisy OMI measurements with\n\n413\n\nsmaller SNR and the additional radiometric biases made by the RA, which vary with space and\n\n414\n\ntime. The smaller SDs at some altitudes of high latitudes may reflect a combination of ozone\n\n415\n\nvariation, uneven distribution of ozonesondes with varying uncertainty at different stations, and\n\n416\n\ncancellation of radiometric errors by the RA.\n\n417\n\nAs seen from the number of OMI/ozonesonde coincidences shown in Figure 3, the northern mid-\n\n418\n\nlatitudes and the tropics have sufficient coincidences to validate the retrievals as a function of\n\n419\n\nseason. In the tropics, the retrieval comparison does exhibit little seasonality as expected (not\n\n420\n\nshown). Figure 4 shows the comparison similar to Figure 3(c) for each individual season at\n\n421\n\nnorthern middle latitudes. The comparison results are clearly season-dependent with different\n\n422\n\naltitude-dependent bias patterns, and with the smallest SDs in the summer (except for the MBs)\n\n423\n\nand the worst SDsin the winter. This indicates the general best retrieval sensitivity to lower\n\n424\n\ntropospheric ozone during the summer as a result of small SZAs and stronger signals and worst\n\n425\n\nretrieval sensitivity during the winter as a result of large SZAs and weaker signals. The MBs for\n\n426\n\nwith and without AKs at 300 hPa vary from ~12% in the winter to -10% in the summer. The\n\n427\n\noverall MBs are the smallest during the spring, within 6%; but the MBs at pressure < 50 hPa are\n\n428\n\nthe best during the summer. The maximum SDs vary from 31% in the winter to 20% in the\n\n429\n\nsummer. Also, the retrieval in the summer shows the most improvements in terms of reduction in\n\n430\n\nSDs over the a priori in the lower troposphere at all tropospheric layers except for the bottom\n\n431\n\nlayer, while the retrievals during other seasons show the improvement over a priori only above\n\n432\n\nthe lowermost two/three layers. The seasonal variation of retrieval quality is partially caused by\n\n433\n\nthe seasonal variations of the retrieval sensitivity and ozone variability. Bak et al. (2013b)\n\n434\n\nshowed that the use of TB ozone climatology with daily NCEP GFS tropopause pressure can\n\n435\n\nsignificantly reduce the seasonal dependence of the comparison with ozonesondes. In addition,\n\n436\n\nradiometric calibration errors such as those caused by stray light and RA also contribute to the\n\n437\n\nseasonal variation of retrieval quality.\n\n438\n\n4.1.2\n\n439\n\nThe SZA of low earth orbit (LEO) satellite observation varies latitudinally and seasonally;\n\n440\n\ntherefore the SZA dependence of the retrieval can cause latitudinal and seasonal dependent\n\nSolar Zenith Angle Dependence\n\n16\n\n441\n\nretrieval biases. SZA is one of the main drivers that affect retrieval sensitivity especially to\n\n442\n\ntropospheric ozone. At large SZA, the measured backscattered signal becomes weak due to weak\n\n443\n\nincoming signal and long path length; the retrieval sensitivity to the tropospheric ozone\n\n444\n\ndecreases due to reduced photon penetration to the troposphere. In addition, measurements are\n\n445\n\nsubject to relatively larger radiometric errors such as those from stray light and as a result of\n\n446\n\nweaker signal, and radiative transfer calculations can lose accuracy at larger SZA (Caudill et al.,\n\n447\n\n1997).\n\n448\n\nFigure 5 gives the MBs and SDs of differences between OMI and ozonesondes (with OMI AKs)\n\n449\n\nin a function of SZAs. We can see that retrieval performance generally becomes worse at large\n\n450\n\nSZA. The SD typically increases with SZA especially at pressure > 300 hPa. At SZA larger than\n\n451\n\n75\xc2\xb0, the SD at ~300 hPa increases to greater than ~45%. The variation of MBs with SZA is more\n\n452\n\ncomplicated. We see generally larger positive biases at larger SZA in the troposphere with >\n\n453\n\n20% biases at SZA larger than 75\xc2\xb0. The MBs near ~ 30 hPa becomes more negative at larger\n\n454\n\nSZAs. There is a strip of positive biases of ~10% that slightly decreases in pressure from ~50\n\n455\n\nhPa at low SZA to ~10 hPa at large SZA; it might be due to some systematic radiometric biases\n\n456\n\nthat can affect ozone at different altitudes varying with SZA. Because of the clear degradation of\n\n457\n\nthe retrieval quality at large SZA, we set the SZA filtering threshold of 75\xc2\xb0 to filter OMI data.\n\n458\n\n4.1.3\n\n459\n\nThe presence of cloud affects retrieval sensitivity since clouds typically reduce sensitivity to\n\n460\n\nozone below clouds and increase sensitivity to ozone above clouds. The accuracy of ozone\n\n461\n\nretrievals is sensitive to the uncertainties of cloud information and cloud treatment (Ant\xc3\xb3n and\n\n462\n\nLoyola, 2011; Bak et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2010a). Our OMI ozone algorithm assumes clouds as\n\n463\n\nLambertian surfaces with optical centroid cloud pressure from the OMI Raman cloud product\n\n464\n\n(Vasilkov et al., 2008), and partial clouds are modeled using independent pixel approximation\n\n465\n\nsuch that the overall radiance is the sum of clear and cloudy radiances weighted by the effective\n\n466\n\ncloud fraction. The cloud albedo is assumed to be 80% and is allowed to vary (>80%) with the\n\n467\n\neffective cloud fraction.\n\n468\n\nFigure 6 gives the influences of effective cloud fraction on the comparisons between OMI and\n\n469\n\nozonesonde observations convolved with OMI AKs. The MBs and SDs do not change much with\n\nCloud Fraction Dependence\n\n17\n\n470\n\ncloud fraction for pressure < 100 hPa, and typically increase with the increase of cloud fraction\n\n471\n\nfor pressure > 100 hPa. The MBs at pressure > 100 hPa, especially greater~300 hPa, increase to\n\n472\n\nmore than 10% with cloud fraction greater than ~0.3. This indicates that the cloud fractions have\n\n473\n\nsmall impacts on the stratospheric retrievals but large impacts on the tropospheric retrievals as\n\n474\n\nexpected. Some of the variation with cloud fraction such as negative biases near ~300 hPa at\n\n475\n\ncloud fraction of ~0.4 and the decreases of positive biases at ~ 50 hPa for cloud fraction greater\n\n476\n\nthan ~0.8 may be partially related to the uncertainties of the cloud parameters. The chosen\n\n477\n\nfiltering threshold of 0.3 in cloud fraction is a tradeoff between validating OMI data with\n\n478\n\nadequate retrieval sensitivity to tropospheric ozone and finding adequate number of\n\n479\n\nOMI/ozonesonde coincidences.\n\n480\n\n4.1.4\n\n481\n\nThe OMI swath is divided into 30 cross-track pixels at the UV1 spatial resolution of our product.\n\n482\n\nEach cross-track position is measured by a different part of the CCD detector, i.e., essentially a\n\n483\n\ndifferent instrument. Radiometric calibration coefficients of the instrument are characterized\n\n484\n\nduring pre-launch only at selected CCD column pixels and then interpolated to other columns,\n\n485\n\ncausing variation in the radiometric calibration performance across the CCD detector. This in\n\n486\n\nturn causes cross-track dependent biases in the calibrated radiance (Liu et al., 2010b), which\n\n487\n\ntherefore causes stripping in almost all the OMI data products if no de-striping procedure is\n\n488\n\napplied. Our retrieval algorithm has included a first-order empirical correction independent of\n\n489\n\nspace and time to remove the cross-track variability (Liu et al., 2010b). However, residual\n\n490\n\ndependence on cross-track position remains and the radiometric calibration at different position\n\n491\n\ncan degrade differently with time (e.g., the RA impact). In addition, the viewing zenith angle\n\n492\n\nranges from ~0\xc2\xb0 to ~70\xc2\xb0 and the footprint area increases by approximately an order of magnitude\n\n493\n\nfrom nadir to the first/last position. So the varying viewing zenith angle causes the variation of\n\n494\n\nretrieval sensitivities and atmospheric variabilities within varying footprint areas may also cause\n\n495\n\nadditional cross-track dependence in the retrieval performance.\n\n496\n\nFigure 7 provides the MBs and SDs of the differences between OMI and ozonesonde convolved\n\n497\n\nwith OMI AKs as a function of cross-track position for pre-RA and post-RA periods,\n\n498\n\nrespectively. It clearly exhibits cross-track dependence especially with large positive/negative\n\nCross-Track Position Dependence\n\n18\n\n499\n\nMBs and large SDs at the first/last several extreme off-nadir positions. This is why we select\n\n500\n\ncross-track positions of 4-27 in the validation to avoid positions with large biases. The enhanced\n\n501\n\nbiases/SDs at positions 24 (RA flagging not applied) and 27 (flagged as RA in UV2 since June\n\n502\n\n25, 2007 but not flagged/applied in UV1) are due to the RA impact during the post-RA period.\n\n503\n\nCross-track positions 1-10 show consistent bias patterns with negative biases in ~300- 50 hPa\n\n504\n\nlayer and positive biases in ~surface \xe2\x80\x93 300 hPa layer, and large standard deviation around ~ 300\n\n505\n\nhPa although the magnitude decreases with increasing cross-track position. This pattern occurs\n\n506\n\nduring both pre-RA and post-RA periods although the values are larger during the post-RA\n\n507\n\nperiod. For other cross-track positions, the variation is relatively smaller but we can still see\n\n508\n\nsmall striping patterns.\n\n509\n\n4.2 Comparison of Partial Ozone Columns\n\n510\n\nWe investigate and validate OMI partial ozone columns, including SOCs, TOCs, and surface-\n\n511\n\n550 hPa and surface-750 hPa ozone columns in this section. We define the lowermost one and\n\n512\n\ntwo layer as surface-750 hPa and surface-550 hPa in this paper, respectively, for conveniences.\n\n513\n\nSimilarly, we also analyze the validation results of SOCs and TOCs during pre-RA and post-RA,\n\n514\n\nrespectively, to test the impacts of RA on OMI partial ozone columns. In addition, we validate\n\n515\n\nozone columns from the surface to ~550 hPa (bottom two layers) and ~ 750 hPa (bottom one\n\n516\n\nlayer) against ozonesonde observations in the tropics and mid-latitude summer where there is\n\n517\n\nbetter retrieval sensitivity to these quantities.\n\n518\n\n4.2.1\n\n519\n\nThe left column of Figure 8 shows the MBs and SDs of the comparisons of OMI and ozonesonde\n\n520\n\nSOCs for each of the five latitude bands during 2004-2014. In all regions, the OMI SOCs have\n\n521\n\nexcellent agreement with ozonesonde SOCs regardless of whether ozonesonde data are\n\n522\n\nconvolved with OMI AKs. The application of OMI AKs to ozonesonde SOCs only slightly\n\n523\n\nimproves the comparison statistics. The MBs with OMI AKs are within 1.8% except for a\n\n524\n\nnegative bias of 3% at northern high latitudes, while the SDs are within 5.1% except for 5.7% at\n\n525\n\nhigh latitudes. The correlation coefficient is greater than 0.95 except for 0.90 in the tropics due to\n\n526\n\nthe smaller SOC range. The SDs are typically larger than the comparisons with MLS data (Liu et\n\nComparison of Stratospheric Ozone Columns (SOCs)\n\n19\n\n527\n\nal., 2010a) due to worse coincidence criteria, relatively larger uncertainty in the ozonesonde\n\n528\n\nstratospheric ozone columns compared to MLS data, and different altitude ranges of integration.\n\n529\n\nThe middle and right columns of Figure 8 show comparison results during the pre-RA and post-\n\n530\n\nRA periods, respectively. The comparison is typically better during the pre-RA with SDs smaller\n\n531\n\nby 0.2-0.6% and larger correlation coefficients although the MBs are generally smaller during\n\n532\n\nthe post-RA period. One exception is at southern high-latitudes where the post-RA comparison\n\n533\n\nstatistics are significantly better except for the MB, consistent with Figure 3, likely due to a\n\n534\n\ncombination of ozone variation between these two periods, uneven distribution of ozonesondes\n\n535\n\nat different stations, and cancellation of various calibration errors.\n\n536\n\n4.2.2\n\n537\n\nThe left column of Figure 9 shows the comparison of OMI and ozonesonde (with and without\n\n538\n\nOMI AKs) TOCs for each of the five latitude bands during 2004-2014. Without applying OMI\n\n539\n\nAKs, the MBs are within 1-3% except for 9% at northern high latitudes; The SDs are within 20%\n\n540\n\nin the tropics and mid-latitudes and increase to ~30-40% at high-latitudes. The correlation\n\n541\n\ncoefficient ranges from 0.83 in the tropics to ~0.7 at middle latitudes, and 0.5-0.6 at high-\n\n542\n\nlatitudes. The linear regression slopes are in the range 0.6-0.8 typically smaller at high latitudes\n\n543\n\ndue to reduced retrieval sensitivity to the lower troposphere. After applying the OMI AKs to\n\n544\n\nozonesonde data to remove smoothing errors, we see significant improvement in the comparison\n\n545\n\nstatistics except for MBs, which are within 6% at all latitudes. The SDs are reduced to within\n\n546\n\n15%in the tropics and middle latitudes and ~30% (5.5-8.1 DU) at high latitudes; the correlation\n\n547\n\nimproves by 0.04-0.12 and the slope significantly increases by 0.12-0.23 to the range 0.8-1.0 at\n\n548\n\ndifferent latitude bands due to accounting for inadequate retrieval sensitivity to the lower and\n\n549\n\nmiddle troposphere.\n\n550\n\nThe middle and right columns of Figure 9 show comparisons during pre-RA and post-RA,\n\n551\n\nrespectively. The comparison between OMI and ozonesondes with OMI AKs TOCs during the\n\n552\n\npre-RA period is significantly better than these during the post-RA period in the tropics and mid-\n\n553\n\nlatitudes with SDs smaller by 3.4-5.5% and greater correlation. The MBs during the post-RA\n\n554\n\nperiod is smaller by ~2 DU at mid-latitudes, but larger by ~1 DU in the tropics. However, the\n\nComparison of Partial Ozone Columns in the Troposphere\n\n20\n\n555\n\npost-RA comparison is similar to the pre-RA comparison at northern high-latitudes and is even\n\n556\n\nbetter at southern high latitudes probably due to the aforementioned ozonesonde issues.\n\n557\n\nFigure 10 shows examples of time series when comparing individual OMI and ozonesondes\n\n558\n\n(with OMI AKs) TOCs and their corresponding differences at six selected stations, one for each\n\n559\n\nlatitude region of 90\xc2\xb0 N-60\xc2\xb0 N, 60\xc2\xb0 N-30\xc2\xb0 N, 30\xc2\xb0 N-0\xc2\xb0, 0\xc2\xb0-30\xc2\xb0 S, 30\xc2\xb0 S-60\xc2\xb0 S and 60\xc2\xb0 S-90\xc2\xb0 S.\n\n560\n\nOMI TOC shows good agreement with ozonesondes at these stations with overall MBs \xe2\x89\xa4 3 DU\n\n561\n\nand SDs less than 5.1 DU. The comparison is also good even in the high latitude regions partially\n\n562\n\nbecause the Summit and Neymayer stations only have ozonesonde launches during local\n\n563\n\nsummer. Seasonal dependent biases are clearly seen at Payerne, and bias trends can be seen at\n\n564\n\nseveral stations with positive trends at Summit and Neumayer and a negative trend at Naha. In\n\n565\n\nthe pre-RA and post-RA periods, the MBs are typically within 2 DU and the SDs are typically\n\n566\n\nsmaller during the pre-RA period except for Naha. The better comparison (both mean bias and\n\n567\n\nstandard deviation) during the post-RA period at Naha is likely due to the switch to ECC\n\n568\n\nozonesondes beginning on November 13, 2008 from KC ozonesonde that have greater\n\n569\n\nuncertainty (WMO, 1998).\n\n570\n\nFigure 2 also shows the MBs and SDs of the TOC differences between OMI and ozonesonde\n\n571\n\nconvolved with OMI AKs at each station/location where there are at least 10 coincident\n\n572\n\nOMI/ozonesonde pairs. OMI data generally exhibit good agreement with ozonesondes at most of\n\n573\n\nthe stations, with MBs of \xe2\x89\xa4 3 DU and SDs of \xe2\x89\xa4 6 DU. In the tropics (30\xc2\xb0 S-30\xc2\xb0 N), very large\n\n574\n\nSDs (>11 DU) occur at the two Indian stations (New Delhi, and Trivandrum). In addition, there\n\n575\n\nis a large bias of > 6 DU at New Delhi. The poor comparisons at these two stations are likely\n\n576\n\nassociated with the large uncertainties of the Indian ozonesonde data. Hilo has large biases of\n\n577\n\n~4.5 DU with 3.2 and 6.2 DU for pre-RA and post-RA, respectively. Java also has a large bias of\n\n578\n\n~5 DU but shows little difference between pre-RA and post-RA. Consistent ~2% and ~5%\n\n579\n\nunderestimates of OC by ozonesondes compared to OMI total ozone are found in Hilo and Java,\n\n580\n\nrespectively (Thompson et al., 2012). These OC underestimates may partly explain the large\n\n581\n\nTOC biases in Hilo and Java. However, the reason for underestimates of ozonesonde-derived OC\n\n582\n\nis unknown. In the middle latitudes, noticeably large SDs and/or biases occur at a few stations\n\n583\n\nsuch as Churchill, Sable Islands, Hohenpeissenberg, and Parah. Three Japanese stations,\n\n584\n\nSapporo, Tateno, and Naha, exhibit relatively large biases of 2-3 DU and even larger biases\n21\n\n585\n\nbefore switching from KC to ECC sondes. Almost half of the 11 northern high latitude stations\n\n586\n\n(60\xc2\xb0 N-90\xc2\xb0 N) and two of the 6 southern high-latitude stations have large SDs/biases. In addition\n\n587\n\nto retrieval biases from the OMI data, some of the large biases or SDs might be partially related\n\n588\n\nto ozonesonde type with different biases and uncertainties due to different types (e.g., Indian\n\n589\n\nsonde stations, Brewer-Mast ozonesonde at Hohenpeissenberg, three KC sonde stations),\n\n590\n\nmanufacturers (e.g., SP vs. ENSCI for ECC sonde), sensor solution or related to individual sonde\n\n591\n\noperations, which was shown in the validation of GOME ozone profile retrievals (Liu et al.,\n\n592\n\n2006a).\n\n593\n\nFigure 11 shows the comparison for each season at northern mid-latitudes. Consistent with\n\n594\n\nprofile comparison, the TOC comparison is season-dependent. When applying OMI AKs, the\n\n595\n\nmean bias varies from 3 DU in winter to -1.5 DU in summer. The SDs are within 6.8 DU with\n\n596\n\nthe smallest value during fall due to less ozone variability. The regression slopes are very close,\n\n597\n\nwithin 0.04 around 0.67. The retrieval sensitivity is smallest during the summer as seen from the\n\n598\n\ngreatest correlation and slope and relatively small standard deviation, and is the worst during the\n\n599\n\nwinter. With OMI AKs applied to ozonesonde profiles, the MBs only slightly change (varying\n\n600\n\nfrom 3.5 DU to -1.3 DU), but the SDs are significantly reduced to within 5.2 DU, the slopes\n\n601\n\nsignificantly increase by ~0.2 to 0.8-1.0, and the correlation improves significantly during the\n\n602\n\nwinter and spring.\n\n603\n\nFigure 12 compares the surface~550 hPa and surface~750 hPa ozone columns with ozonesonde\n\n604\n\ndata in the middle latitudes during summer and the tropics. Compared to the TOC comparisons\n\n605\n\nin Figure 9 and Figure 11, the comparisons of these lower tropospheric ozone columns exhibit\n\n606\n\nsmaller regression slopes and correlations that are a result of reduced retrieval sensitivity. In the\n\n607\n\ntropics, the slopes decrease from 0.78 in TOC to 0.65 in the surface~550 hPa ozone column and\n\n608\n\n~0.50 in the surface~750 hPa column, with corresponding correlation from 0.83 to 0.74 in the\n\n609\n\nsurface-~550 hPa column, and 0.66 in the surface-~750 hPa column. This indicates that the\n\n610\n\nretrievals in the surface~550 hPa/750 hPa can capture ~65%/50% of the actual ozone change\n\n611\n\nfrom the a priori. During the middle latitude summer, the slope decreases from 0.71 in the TOC\n\n612\n\ncomparisons to 0.42 in the surface-~550 hPa comparisons and 0.32 in the surface-~750 hPa\n\n613\n\ncomparisons, with corresponding correlation coefficients from 0.74 to 0.5 and 0.46. Thus, the\n\n614\n\nretrievals in the surface~550 hPa and ~750 hPa only capture ~40%/30% of the actual ozone\n22\n\n615\n\nchange from the a priori. The MBs are generally small within 0.5 DU (5%) with SDs of ~3.6 DU\n\n616\n\n(20-28%) in the surface~550 hPa ozone column and ~2.5 DU (25-36%) in the surface~750 hPa\n\n617\n\nozone column. After applying OMI AKs to account for inadequate retrieval sensitivity and\n\n618\n\nremoving smoothing errors, the slope significantly increases to approach 1 (as expected). SDs\n\n619\n\nare reduced to ~10% in the middle latitudes and ~15% in the tropics.\n\n620\n\n4.3 Evaluation of Long-term Performance\n\n621\n\nComparisons in Sects 4.1 and 4.2 indicated systematic differences between pre-RA and post-RA\n\n622\n\nperiods and generally worse performance during the post-RA periods. To further illustrate the\n\n623\n\nlong-term stability of our ozone profile product and understand the quality of OMI radiometric\n\n624\n\ncalibration as a function of time, we analyze monthly MBs of OMI/ozonesonde differences with\n\n625\n\nOMI retrieval AKs in ozone profiles, SOCs, and TOCs. Due to the lack of OMI observations\n\n626\n\nduring some months at high-latitudes, we focus the evaluation by using coincidence pairs in 60\xc2\xb0\n\n627\n\nS-60\xc2\xb0 N. Monthly MBs are calculated only if there are more than 5 OMI-ozonesonde pairs in a\n\n628\n\ngiven month. Linear regression trend is on the MBs for the entire period (2004-2014) and/or for\n\n629\n\nthe pre-RA and post-RA periods, respectively. The trend is considered statistically significant if\n\n630\n\nits P value is less than 0.05.\n\n631\n\nThe linear trends of monthly mean ozone biases for each OMI layer between 60\xc2\xb0 S-60\xc2\xb0 N are\n\n632\n\nplotted in Figure 13 for each of the three periods. During 2004-2014, marked in black, ozone\n\n633\n\nbiases at layers above 50.25 hPa show significant positive trends of 0.06-0.17 DU/year (0.17-\n\n634\n\n0.52%/year), while ozone biases between 290 hPa and 110 hPa exhibit significant negative\n\n635\n\ntrends of 0.1-0.19 DU/year (1-2%/year). The positive trends in the stratosphere are generally\n\n636\n\nconsistent with those shown in OMI-MLS comparisons (Huang et al., 2017). In the lowermost\n\n637\n\nthree OMI layers, ozone differences are more stable but with several large spikes during the post-\n\n638\n\nRA periods likely due to the RA evolution or instrument operation. The derived trends for the\n\n639\n\npre-RA period are generally more flat and insignificant at all layers indicating good stability of\n\n640\n\nour product as well as the OMI radiometric calibration. During the post-RA period, the derived\n\n641\n\ntrends are positive above 75 hPa with statistical significance. These positive trends in the\n\n642\n\nstratosphere are generally similar to those over the entire period, suggesting the dominant\n\n643\n\ncontribution of the post-RA period to the overall trend. In the altitude range 214 \xe2\x80\x93 108 hPa, the\n23\n\n644\n\npost-RA trends are also flat similar to the pre-RA trends, but the values are systematically\n\n645\n\nsmaller during the post-RA period, causing significantly negative trends over the entire period.\n\n646\n\nThe SOC biases exhibit small positive trend of 0.14\xc2\xb10.09 DU/year in 2004-2014 with no\n\n647\n\nstatistical significance (Figure 14(a)). This slight positive trend is a result of trend cancellation\n\n648\n\nby the positive trends above 80 hPa and negative trends between 220 hPa and 80 hPa The TOC\n\n649\n\nbiases reveal a significant negative trend of -0.18 \xc2\xb1 0.05 DU/year (Figure 14(b)), mostly from\n\n650\n\nlayers in the upper troposphere. In the pre-RA and post-RA periods, both trends of both SOC and\n\n651\n\nTOC biases are relatively flat during the pre-RA period, while the SOC trend in the post-RA\n\n652\n\nperiod is 0.77 \xc2\xb1 0.20 DU/year with significance. It is noticeable that the P value of TOC trend in\n\n653\n\nthe post-RA period is 0.06.\n\n654\n\nThe significant trends of ozone biases at different layers as well as in SOC and TOC suggest that\n\n655\n\nthe current ozone profile product is not suitable for trend studies especially during the post-RA\n\n656\n\nperiod. The relatively flat bias trends during the pre-RA periods and statistically significant\n\n657\n\ntrends during the post-RA period confirm that the better stability of our product during the pre-\n\n658\n\nRA period and more temporal variation of the retrieval performance during the post-RA period\n\n659\n\nare likely associated with the RA evolution. In previous sections, the validation of our retrievals\n\n660\n\nrevealed latitudinal/seasonal/SZA and cross-track dependent biases even during the pre-RA\n\n661\n\nperiod. This indicates the need to remove signal dependent errors and the calibration\n\n662\n\ninconsistency across the track. To maintain the spatial consistency and long-term stability of our\n\n663\n\nozone profile product, we need to further improve OMI\xe2\x80\x99s radiometric calibration especially\n\n664\n\nduring the post-RA period. Preferably, the calibration improvement should be done in the level\n\n665\n\n0-1b processing. If this option is not possible, we can perform soft calibration similar to Liu et al.\n\n666\n\n(2010b) but derive the correction as a function of time and latitude/SZA. In addition, it should be\n\n667\n\nnoted that the trend calculation might be affected by factors such as the availability of correction\n\n668\n\nfactors with ozonesondes (Morris et al., 2013), station-to-station variability and the uneven\n\n669\n\nspatiotemporal distribution of the ozonesondes, which can introduce considerable sampling\n\n670\n\nbiases (Liu et al., 2009; Saunois et al., 2012).\n\n24\n\n671\n\n5 Summary and Conclusion\n\n672\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of OMI ozone profile (PROFOZ)\n\n673\n\nproducts produced by the SAO algorithm, including their spatial consistency and long-term\n\n674\n\nperformance using coincident global ozonesonde observations during the decade 2004-2014. To\n\n675\n\nbetter understand retrieval errors and sensitivity, we compared the retrieved ozone profiles and a\n\n676\n\npriori profile at individual layers with ozonesondes before and after being degraded to the OMI\n\n677\n\nvertical resolution with OMI retrieval average kernels (AKs). We also compared the integrated\n\n678\n\nSOC, TOC, and surface-~550/~750 hPa ozone columns with ozonesonde data. To understand the\n\n679\n\nspatial distribution of retrieval performance, the validations are grouped into five latitude ranges:\n\n680\n\nnorthern/southern high/middle latitudes, and the tropics. To investigate the impacts of the OMI\n\n681\n\nrow anomaly (RA) on the retrievals, we contrasted the comparison before and after the\n\n682\n\noccurrence of major OMI RA in January 2009, i.e., pre-RA (2004-2008) and post-RA (2009-\n\n683\n\n2014) periods. In addition, we quantified the dependence of retrieval performance on seasonality\n\n684\n\nand several key parameters including solar zenith angle (SZA), cloud fraction, and cross-track\n\n685\n\nposition. Finally, we analyzed the monthly mean variation of the mean biases (MBs) to examine\n\n686\n\nthe long-term stability of the PROFOZ product.\n\n687\n\nThe comparison between OMI and ozonesonde profiles varies in altitude, with maximum\n\n688\n\nstandard deviations (SDs) in the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (UTLS) due to\n\n689\n\nsignificant ozone variability, and varies with latitude similarly in the northern and southern\n\n690\n\nhemispheres. There is good agreement throughout the atmosphere in the tropics and mid-\n\n691\n\nlatitudes. With the application of OMI AKs to ozonesonde data, the MBs are within 6%, and the\n\n692\n\nSDs increase from 5-10% for pressure < ~50 hPa to within 18%(27%) in the tropics/mid-\n\n693\n\nlatitudes for pressure > ~50 hPa. In the high latitudes, the retrievals agree well with ozonesondes\n\n694\n\nonly for pressure < ~50 hPa with MBs of < 10% and SDs of 5-15% for pressure < ~ 50 hPa, but\n\n695\n\nwith MBs reaching 30% and SDs reaching 40% for pressure > ~50 hPa. The comparison results\n\n696\n\nare seasonally dependent. At northern mid-latitudes, there are generally the best retrieval\n\n697\n\nsensitivity and the smallest SDs as great as 20% in the summer, and the worst sensitivity and the\n\n698\n\nlargest SDs reaching 31% in the winter. The MBs near 300 hPa vary from 12% in the winter to -\n\n699\n\n10% in the summer. The post-RA comparison is generally worse in the tropics and mid-latitudes\n\n700\n\nthan the pre-RA comparison, with SDs larger by up to 8% in the troposphere and 2% in the\n25\n\n701\n\nstratosphere, and with larger MBs around ~300 hPa in the mid-latitudes. But at high latitudes, the\n\n702\n\npre-RA comparison does not show persistent improvement over the post-RA comparison, with\n\n703\n\nsmaller biases and larger SDs at some altitudes, especially at southern high latitudes. The\n\n704\n\nretrieval improvement over a priori can be determined from the SD reduction of the retrieval\n\n705\n\ncomparison from the a priori comparison. The retrievals demonstrate clear improvement over the\n\n706\n\na priori down to the surface in the tropics, but only down to ~750 hPa during mid-latitude\n\n707\n\nsummer, ~550 hPa during the other seasons of mid-latitudes and ~ 300 hPa at high latitudes.\n\n708\n\nRetrieval performance typically becomes worse at large SZA, especially at SZA larger than 75\xc2\xb0,\n\n709\n\nwhere the MBs in the troposphere are >20% and the SDs near ~300 hPa are > 45%. The worse\n\n710\n\nperformance at larger SZA is due to a combination of weaker signal and greater influence by\n\n711\n\nradiometric calibration errors such as due to stray light, and radiative transfer calculation errors.\n\n712\n\nThe variation of SZA is likely responsible for the majority of the retrieval dependence on latitude\n\n713\n\nand season. The retrieval quality for pressure > ~100 hPa degrades with increasing cloudiness in\n\n714\n\nterms of MBs and SDs, with MBs greater than 10% at cloud fraction > 0.3. The retrieval\n\n715\n\nperformance also varies with cross-track position, especially with large MBs and SDs at the\n\n716\n\nfirst/last extreme off-nadir positions (e.g., 1-3 and 28-30). The dependence is stronger during the\n\n717\n\npost-RA period.\n\n718\n\nThe integrated SOCs and TOCs also exhibit good agreement with ozonesondes. With the\n\n719\n\nconvolution of OMI AKs to ozonesonde data, the SOC MBs are within 2% with SDs within\n\n720\n\n~5.1% in the tropics and mid-latitudes. These statistics do not change much even without the\n\n721\n\napplications of OMI AKs. The comparison becomes slightly worse at high latitudes, with MBs\n\n722\n\nup to 3% and SDs up to 6%. The pre-RA comparison is generally better with smaller SDs of 0.2-\n\n723\n\n0.6% except for southern high latitudes, although with slightly larger MBs. The TOC MBs and\n\n724\n\nSDs with OMI AKs are within 6%, with SDs of <~15% in the tropics and mid-latitudes but reach\n\n725\n\n30% at high latitudes. The pre-RA TOC comparison is also better in the tropics and mid-latitudes\n\n726\n\nwith SDs smaller by 3.4-5.5% but worse values at southern high latitudes. The TOC comparison\n\n727\n\nat northern mid-latitudes varies with season, with MBs of 11%. There are worse correlation\n\n728\n\nduring winter and MBs of -3% and best correlation in summer. The TOC comparison also shows\n\n729\n\nnoticeable station-to-station variability in similar latitude ranges with much larger MBs and/or\n\n730\n\nSDs at the two Indian stations and larger MBs at several Japanese stations before they switched\n26\n\n731\n\nfrom KC ozonesondes to ECC ozonesondes. This demonstrates the impacts of ozonesonde\n\n732\n\nuncertainties due to sonde types, manufacturers, sensor solution and operations. Without\n\n733\n\napplying OMI AKs, the TOC correlation with ozonesondes typically becomes worse at higher\n\n734\n\nlatitudes, ranging from 0.83 in the tropics to 0.5-0.6 at high latitudes. The linear regression slope\n\n735\n\nis within 0.6-0.8, typically smaller at higher latitudes, reflecting the smaller retrieval sensitivity\n\n736\n\ndown to the troposphere at higher latitudes mainly resulting from larger SZA. The convolution of\n\n737\n\nAKs significantly improves the correlation and slope. The impact of retrieval sensitivity related\n\n738\n\nto SZA is also reflected in the seasonal dependence of the comparison at mid-latitudes.\n\n739\n\nThe surface-~550/750 hPa ozone columns in the tropics during mid-latitude summer compare\n\n740\n\nquite well with ozonesonde data, with MBs of < 5% and SDs of 20-25%/28-36% without OMI\n\n741\n\nAKs. The correlation and slope decrease with decreasing altitude range due to reduced retrieval\n\n742\n\nsensitivity down to the lower troposphere. These columns capture ~65%/50% of the actual ozone\n\n743\n\nchange in the tropics and ~40%/30% in the troposphere. Convolving ozonesonde data with OMI\n\n744\n\nAKs significantly increases the slope to ~1 and reduce the SDs to 10-15%.\n\n745\n\nThe contrast of pre-RA and post-RA comparisons indicates generally worse post-RA\n\n746\n\nperformance with larger SDs. Linear trend analysis of the OMI/ozonesonde monthly MBs further\n\n747\n\nreveals additional RA impact. The temporal performance over 60\xc2\xb0 S-60\xc2\xb0 N is generally stable\n\n748\n\nwith no statistically significant trend during the pre-RA period, but displays a statistically\n\n749\n\nsignificant trend of 0.14-0.7%/year at individual layers for pressure < ~80 hPa, 0.7 DU/year in\n\n750\n\nSOC and -0.33 DU/year in TOC during the post-RA period. Because of these artificial trends in\n\n751\n\nour product, we caution against using our product for ozone trend studies.\n\n752\n\nThis validation study demonstrates generally good retrieval performance of our ozone profile\n\n753\n\nproduct especially in the tropics and mid-latitudes during the pre-RA period. However, the\n\n754\n\nspatiotemporal variation of retrieval performance suggests that OMI\xe2\x80\x99s radiometric calibration\n\n755\n\nshould be improved, especially during the post-RA period, including the removal of signal-\n\n756\n\ndependent errors, calibration inconsistency across the track and with time to maintain the long-\n\n757\n\nterm stability and spatial consistency of our ozone profile product.\n\n27\n\n758\n\nData Availability\n\n759\n\nOMI PROFOZ (version 0.9.3) used in this study is available to users at Aura Validation Data\n\n760\n\nCenter (AVDC) (https://avdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.php?site=1389025893&id=74).\n\n761\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n762\n\nThis study was supported by the NASA Atmospheric Composition: Aura Science Team\n\n763\n\n(NNX14AF16G) and the Smithsonian Institution.
