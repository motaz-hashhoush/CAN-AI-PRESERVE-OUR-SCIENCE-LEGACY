20).\nSYSTEM\nSTUDIES\nRESULTS\nThe intensive evaluation of LFC system concepts in NASA\ncontract NASI-14631\n(ref. 15) resulted in the preliminary design of the LockheedLFC transport shownin\nFigure 3. It is a wide-body configuration designed to carry 400 passengers and\nbaggage over an intercontinental\nrange of 6500 nautical miles at M = 0.80 cruise\nspeeds with adequate fuel to account for adverse winds, intermittent LFC disruption\ndue to atmospheric conditions at cruise, and international fuel reserves. The total\npayload of the aircraft including passengers and baggage is 84,800 pounds.\nThe general arrangement drawing of the LockheedLFC transport aircraft is presented in Figure 4. The aircraft is a low-wing T-tail monoplanewith four aftmounted engines. An independently driven LFC suction unit is located in a fairing\nunder each wing root. Fuel is carried in the wing, including the wing centersection box. The wing has 25\xc2\xb0 sweepat the leading edge, an aspect ratio of 11.6,\nand a wing loading of 111.8 pounds per square foot. Full-span flaps, including\ndrooped ailerons, provide the required airport performance for a lO,000-foot runway.\nLeading-edge, high-lift\ndevices are not required. Partial-span spoilers are provided. Small-chord (i0 percent) secondary flaps incorporated into the main flaps\nprovide upper surface pressure gradient and shock position control for off-design\noperation, and serve as active controls to minimize structural requirements. The\ntakeoff gross weight of the aircraft is 592,205 pounds. LFC suction capability is\nprovided on upper and lower wing surfaces from 0 to 75 percent chord and on the\nempennage\nfrom 0 to 65 percent chord. The effectiveness of the Lockheed design\napproach in the integration of LFC-peculiar items resulted in the relatively low\nweight of 4.4 percent of the empty weight incurred for LFC. The dedicated slots at\nthe leading edge for dispensing the flow of a liquid to present contamination of the\nsurface during takeoff and climb out required an amount of fluid per flight which is\n2.6 percent of the gross weight of the aircraft.\nThe benefits of LFC shown in Figure 5 were determined by comparison of the performance of the LFC aircraft and an equivalent advanced technology turbulent aircraft\nwhich performed the samemission as that of the LFC aircraft.\nThe calculations of\naircraft drag indicate a 60 percent reduction in the wing and empennage\ndrag, resulting from the effects of LFC in reducing skin-friction\ndrag. The corresponding reduction in total aircraft drag due to LFC is 15 percent. The weight empty of the LFC\naircraft is about 1 percent greater than the turbulent aircraft but the takeoff gross\nweight of the LFC aircraft is 8 percent lower, primarily due to the 22 percent reduction in fuel required for the long-range mission. The lower fuel burned provides a\n4 percent reduction in direct operating costs (DOC).\nDuring the time period of the intensive system evaluation studies of commercial\nLFC transport studies under contract NASI-14631, Lockheedwas continuing its preliminary design studies of military cargo airlift\naircraft under Independent Research and\nDevelopment projects.\nA general arrangement drawing of one of the military LFC\ntransports presented in Figure 6 shows a M = 0.68 cruise speed with four times the\npayload of the 400 passenger commercial transport in the NASA\nstudy. With a lower\namount of sweep in the wing, the aspect ratio was increased to 15, and for the\n6000-nautical-mile-range capability, the takeoff gross weight is about 1.2 million\npounds. The results of these military LFC transport studies were presented at a\n56\n\nspecial meeting on laminar-flow control conducted by the Defense AdvancedResearch\nProjects Agency on May 2, 1978. The parametric study included cruise Machnumbers\nfrom 0.65 to 0.80 and ranges from 6,000 nautical miles to 12,000 nautical miles.\nFuel savings of 16 percent were indicated for the laminar-flow control aircraft\nas comparedto that for the turbulent flow aircraft\nfor the samemission\ncharacteristics.\nNASA\nLEADING-EDGE\nSYSTEMS\nFLIGHTTESTPROGRAM\nEncouragedby the progress madein the development and validation of leadingedge cleaning, anti-icing,\nand suction systems so vital to the success of an LFC\ntransport, Lockheed and Douglas developed flight test articles with NASA\nfunding\nthat were installed and tested on the NASA-Dryden\nFlight Research Facility JetStar\naircraft.\nThe Lockheed activity is reported in reference 18. An early review of\nthe total NASA\nprogram is given by Wagnerand Fischer in reference 21. In addition\nto the development of the leading-edge test article, Lockheed had the added responsibility\nfor providing the aircraft structural and support system design and\nintegration.\nThe schematic diagram in Figure 7 shows the NASA\nJetStar flight test airplane\nwith the McDonnell-Douglas perforated leading-edge flight test article on one wing\nand the Lockheed slotted test article on the other wing. Both LFC suction concepts\nare logical candidates, and the flight tests were madeto determine the effectiveness\nof these system concepts for leading-edge cleaning, anti-icing,\nand cruise suction\nLFC conditions.\nThe test articles were instrumented for measuring boundary-layer\nconditions, suction flows, and other basic aircraft\nflight parameters. After ground\nand flight check-out and acceptance tests, the aircraft was operated in a simulated\nairline service phase to accumulate the operational flight data required.\nThe total\nflight program is reviewed by NASAin reference 22.\nThe Lockheed leading-edge test article shown in a cross-section view in Figure 8\nis a sandwich construction consisting of a 0.Ol6-inch-thick\ntitanium outer skin\nbonded to a substructure of graphite/epoxy face sheets with a Nomexhoneycombcore.\nSuction slots are cut in the titanium outer skin by a high-speed steel jeweler\'s\nsaw to provide fine spanwise slots about 0.0035 inch wide on both upper and lower\nsurfaces back to the front spar location.\nThe suction flow passes through the wing\nouter skin into slot ducts which have metering holes into the collector ducts\nimbedded in the honeycomb. The insert protection and anti-icing are accomplished by\ndispensing the cleaning/anti-icing\nfluid over the wing surface through the slots\nabove and below the wing flow attachment line as denoted by slots C and D on Figure 8. These slots are purged of the fluid during climbout and provide suction to\nachieve laminar flow at cruise conditions in combination with the slots denoted by\nU and L.\nA problem in fabrication of the leading-edge test article was discovered upon\nsuction flow check out of the final article.\nIt was determined that migration of\nthe adhesive during the titanium-to-graphite\nfaced core bonding process had plugged\nup a few of the slots, metering holes on collector ducts in a randommanner on the\ntest article.\nThe attendant loss of suction flow in these locations prevented the\nlocal attainment of conditions necessary for laminar flow. As a result, the attainment of laminar flow over the entire test article could not be realized during the\nflight testing.\n57\n\nA\n\nclose-up\n\nJetStar\nof\n\nLFC\n\nthe\n\nphotograph\n\nflight\n\naircraft\n\nof\n\ntest\n\nin\n\nAt\n\na

High-Altitude,\nLong-Endurance,\nUnmanned\nAircraft,\nthe PS-22 Multimission\nRemotely\nPiloted\nVehicle,\nand the PS-35 Airborne\nSurveillance\nSystem.\n\n59\n\nA recent study of military laminar-flow control transport aircraft was conducted\nby Lockheed under an Air Force contract study, "Technology Alternatives for Airlift\nDeployment" (ref. 24). A sketch of the military LFC transport given in Figure 17 is\nfor a Mach 0.80 cruise aircraft with a payload of 212,000 pounds, a range of 5800\nnautical miles, and a takeoff gross weight of 786,700 pounds. The aircraft utilized\nLFC from the leading edge back to 65 percent of the wing chord and to 75 percent\nchord on the empennage\nsurfaces. As comparedto a comparable turbulent flow transport the LFC transport showeda 40 percent increase in range for the samepayload\nbut with an attendant i0 percent increase in structural weight.\nThe laminar-flow control transport showeda 14 percent reduction in mission fuel\nas comparedto that for the turbulent flow aircraft.\nThe fuselage-mounted engine\nlocation is a compromiseamongconsiderations of weight and balance, nose wheel lift\noff at takeoff and, of course, avoidance of wing-mounted engines.\nThe scope of the Task 2 preliminary design study of contract NASI-18036is\nincluded in five study elements: (i) Basic Data Assumptions, (2) Mission Characteristics,\n(3) Configuration Development, (4) Configuration Selection, and (5) Analysis\nof Laminar-Flow Benefits.\nIn element (i), the approach is to utilize\nthe technology\ndata base in the Lockheed Generalized Aircraft Sizing and Performance (GASP)computer program used in the Air Force Technology Alternatives for Airlift\nDeployment\n(TAFAD)study. Modification is madeto the data base to account for the change to\nthe hybrid laminar-flow control concept from the previous LFC concept. Mission\ncharacteristics\nsuch as payload, range, cruise Machnumber, airfield\nperformance,\nand operational concepts have been mutually agreed upon amongNASA,the Air Force,\nand Lockheed. The baseline mission characteristics\npresented in Figure 18 are based\nupon the following considerations:\nthe payload of 132,500 pounds is generic for\nmulti-purpose missions of the Air Force under study by Lockheed under AFWAL\ncontract\n(see ref. 25); cruise speed of Mach 0.77 will be increased to Mach0.80; initial\ncruise altitude will be a fallout to provide best cruise efficiency for the Pratt &\nWhitney STF-686 turbofan propulsion system and initial\nresults of about 31,000 feet\nwere increased to 36,000 feet; the initial\ntakeoff field length and field length at\nthe midpoint are representative of those for long-range transoceanic flights;\nand\nthe radius-type payload/range with no refueling at the mid-point provides military\nforce projection to manyparts of the world of interest to the Air Force. The range\ncapability provides access to Pacific Rim countries which are important to operators\nof commercial transport aircraft.\nThe HLFCdesign ground rules listed in Figure 19 are, with a few exceptions,\nbasically self-explanatory and consistent with previous LFC studies. Turbulent flow\nis assumedto occur during 6 percent of cruise time to assure mission completion\nshould atmospheric conditions preclude the use of HLFCfor short periods during\ncruise. The 12 percent excess cruise thrust provides the capability to maintain\ncruise altitude and/or speed with the HLFCsystem inactive.\nThe wing sweepwas\nvaried for both the HLFCand comparison turbulent flow aircraft in the parametric\nsizing studies as will be discussed later.\nThe number in the flight crew provides\nfor rest cycles for this long-range mission. It was assumedthat technology readiness of 1994 will provide an initial\noperational capability (IOC) for the year 2000.\nResults of the ongoing parametric design studies of Task 2 are provided in Figure 20 of an initial\nbaseline HLFCdesign concept for the long-range mission and at a\ncruise Machnumber of 0.77. The design concept features the fuselage-mounted engines\nsimilar to the previous Air Force TAFADstudy (ref. 24). In addition, geometric\nfeatures include a wing sweep of 20\xc2\xb0 , an aspect ratio of 13.86, and a wing span of\n60\n\n259 feet.\nPerformance characteristics\ninclude a takeoff gross weight of\n594,548 pounds, mission fuel of 253,330 pounds, and a lift-to-drag\nratio of 30.9.\nAs mentioned earlier, wing sweepsof 20\xc2\xb0 and 25\xc2\xb0 were investigated in the parametric\nsizing runs for the HLFCaircraft.\nA comparison of the parametric data for the two\nsweepcases showedmixed results with the 20\xc2\xb0 sweep design indicating slightly higher\nlift-to-drag\nratio than the 25\xc2\xb0 design but the 25\xc2\xb0 design indicating slightly less\nfuel burned and takeoff gross weight. The 20\xc2\xb0 sweep design was selected because it\nwas expected that less leading-edge cross flow would be encountered than that for\nthe higher sweep design.\nParametric sizing data were derived for the turbulent flow aircraft with the\nwing sweepvarying from 25\xc2\xb0 to 40\xc2\xb0 for identical mission requirements as those for\nthe HLFCdesigns. The data indicate a superiority of the 30\xc2\xb0 sweepdesign based on\nan overall comparison of minimumfuel burned, maximum\nlift-to-drag\nratio, and minimum\ntakeoff gross weight. A general arrangement drawing of the baseline 30\xc2\xb0 sweep turbulent design presented in Figure 21 features wing-mounted engines, an aspect ratio\nof 13.5, and a wing span of 256 feet.\nPerformance characteristics\ninclude a takeoff\ngross weight of 616,125 pounds, mission fuel of 291,401 pounds, and a lift-to-drag\nratio of 26.\nThe benefits of HLFCpresented in Figure 22 were determined by a comparison of\nthe performance of HLFCdesigns with that for the baseline turbulent design, which\nperformed the samemission as that of the HLFCdesigns. Data for the HLFCbaseline\ndesign and two variations from that design are presented in the three columns of\nFigure 22 and the percentage changes are all referenced to the baseline turbulent\ndesign. As presented in the first column, the baseline HLFCdesign as comparedto\nthe baseline turbulent flow design indicates an increase in operating empty weight\nof 5.4 percent, a decrease in takeoff gross weight of 4 percent, a decrease in fuel\nconsumption of 13.4 percent, and an increase in lift-to-drag\nratio of 18.4 percent.\nThe second column of Figure 22 shows the effects of deleting laminar-flow control\nfrom the empennage the HLFCaircraft;\nof\nand the results, as expected, are small with\nslightly higher aircraft weights, an improvement in the fuel consumption, and little\nchange in the lift-to-drag\nratio.\nThe effects of deleting HLFCon the lower wing\nsurfaces show significant\nadverse effects on aircraft weights, fuel consumption, and\nlift-to-drag\nratio.\nAs comparedto the HLFCbaseline aircraft,\nthe overall effect\nof a decrease in lift-to-drag\nratio of 32 percent and an increase in fuel consumption\nof 41 percent gives an increase in takeoff gross weight of 85 percent. Although not\nshownon Figure 22, an increase in initial\ncruise altitude of the HLFCdesign to\n36,000 feet has a slightly adverse effect on the weights and fuel consumption and\nan improvement in the lift-to-drag\nratio.\nIt should be noted that the aspect ratios of both turbulent flow and HLFCdesign\nconcepts are relatively high as comparedto the state-of-the-art\nand to near-term\nprojections.\nAlthough a number of conceptual design studies have utilized design\nconcepts with aspect ratios from 13 to 16 and even higher, there is concern that\nsuch aspect ratios will be achievable on a fully operational, flight worthy and\ncertified aircraft in the next 5 to i0 years. The global range Task 2 study will\naddress this concern with a study of a lower aspect ratio design.\nIn summary, these studies of the application of HLFCto global range military\ntransport aircraft show a significant\nincrease in lift-to-drag\nratio (18 percent),\ndecrease in fuel consumption (13 percent), and decrease in takeoff gross weight\n(4 percent) for a 5 percent increase in empty weight as comparedto that for global\nrange turbulent flow aircraft.\n61\n\nSTATUS NDRECOMMENDATIONS\nA\nFORFURTHER\nWORK\nIt is clear that substantial progress has been madein the NASA/Industry technology development of laminar-flow control over the past i0 years as indicated in\nFigure 23. The recently completed flight tests of LFC leading-edge systems have\nsuccessfully demonstrated solutions to leading-edge contamination. These tests have\nalso obtained laminar flow over both slotted and perforated surfaces for a variety\nof flight conditions and from operation out of manyairport operating environments.\nThe current NASA/Industry Laminar-Flow Enabling Technology Development projects\ninitiated in 1985 are continuing to provide direction to the achievement of technology readiness for application of LFC to future long-range transport aircraft.\nAs discussed previously the simplified HLFCconcept reduces the complexity of LFC\nand thus provides for one more near-term application of this technology. The significant benefits of HLFCindicated in the global range aircraft studies described\nherein provide the justification\nfor an accelerated effort to develop the desired\ndata base on HLFCfor application to long-range transport aircraft.\nWith the present\nstate of the art in HLFCtechnology, additional development is required especially\nfor application to long-range transport aircraft in the high Reynolds number regime.\nThe current LFC data base in wind tunnel and flight tests is limited to a maximum\nReynolds number of about 20 million.\nThis situation leads to the next logical step\nin the development of HLFC.\nWhat is now needed in HLFC, as outlined in Figure 24, is an experimental flight\nprogram on a swept wing aircraft to obtain the required data at high Reynolds numbers, i.e., 30 to 50 million, and at cruise Machnumbers and altitudes representative\nof long-range transport operation.\nThese tests are needed to obtain the physical\nflow properties of the boundary layer including leading-edge crossflow and twodimensional disturbances aft of the leading edge and over the main wing box area.\nThese data can only be obtained by meansof flight tests on a representative subsonic speed, long-range aircraft.\nA program of this type is a logical extension of\nthe ongoing NASA\nprogram in laminar flow and laminar-flow control research. Such a\nprogram has been discussed with NASA Lockheed utilizing\nby\nthe C-141 as the flight\ntest aircraft.\nTo this end it is gratifying to note the issue of NASA\nRFP\n1-42-3610.0049, "High Reynolds NumberHybrid Laminar-Flow Control (HLFC) Flight\nExperiment," in a cooperative effort with the Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories.\nThis flight investigation is envisioned as the final step in the achievement\nof the technology readiness for application of HLFCto long-range transport aircraft\nin the mid to late 1990\'s.\nSUMMARY\nANDCONCLUSIONS\nThe summaryand concluding remarks for this paper are outlined in Figure 25.\nConsiderable progress has been madein the NASA/Industry LFC program from its inception in October 1974. Furthermore this work has provided the United States with a\ncompetitive edge over our foreign competitors. In order to maintain this edge, a\nhigh Reynolds number flight test program on a subsonic speed, swept wing aircraft\nwith HLFCshould be initiated at the earliest possible time. It is hereby noted\nthat NASA\nhas issued an RFPfor such a program in a cooperative effort with the Air\nForce Wright Aeronautical Laboratories.\nIndustry as yet does not have the required data base to proceed with the design\nand fabrication of an HLFCaircraft for operational use. The global range aircraft\n62\n\nstudy has shown significant\nbenefits for HLFCapplication on the order of an 18 percent increase in lift-to-drag\nratio and a 13 percent reduction in fuel consumption\nas comparedwith turbulent flow aircraft.\nThese results warrant an accelerated\neffort to develop the HLFCtechnology data base required for technology readiness.\nREFERENCES\ni.\n\nBraslow, Albert L., and Muraca, Ralph J., "A Perspective of Laminar-Fuel\nControl," AIAA Paper 78-1528, Los Angeles, CA, August 1978.\n\n2.
