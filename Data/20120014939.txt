b'Series Bosch System Development\nMorgan B. Abney1, Christopher Evans2, and Matt Mansell3\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL 35812\nand\nMichael Swickrath4\nNASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX 77058\n\nState-of-the-art (SOA) carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction technology for the International\nSpace Station produces methane as a byproduct. This methane is subsequently vented\noverboard. The associated loss of hydrogen ultimately reduces the mass of oxygen that can\nbe recovered from CO2 in a closed-loop life support system. As an alternative to SOA CO 2\nreduction technology, NASA is exploring a Series-Bosch system capable of reducing CO2\nwith hydrogen to form water and solid carbon. This results in 100% theoretical recovery of\noxygen from metabolic CO2. In the past, Bosch-based technology did not trade favorably\nagainst SOA technology due to a high power demand, low reaction efficiencies, concerns\nwith carbon containment, and large resupply requirements necessary to replace expended\ncatalyst cartridges. An alternative approach to Bosch technology, labeled \xe2\x80\x9cSeries-Bosch,\xe2\x80\x9d\nemploys a new system design with optimized multi-stage reactors and a membrane-based\nseparation and recycle capability. Multi-physics modeling of the first stage reactor, along\nwith chemical process modeling of the integrated system, has resulted in a design with\npotential to trade significantly better than previous Bosch technology. The modeling process\nand resulting system architecture selection are discussed.\n\nNomenclature\nACM\nALSSAT\nAR\nCFr\nCM\nCO2\n\nESM\nEVA\nH2\nISS\nLSS\nM\nMSFC\nO2\nRWGS\n1\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nAspen Custom Modeler\xc2\xae\nAdvanced Life Support Sizing and Analysis Tool\nAtmosphere revitalization\nCarbon formation reactor\nCrew member\nCarbon dioxide\nPower equivalency for ESM analysis, [kg/kW]\nCooling equivalency for ESM analysis, [kg/kW]\nCrew-time equivalency for ESM analysis, [kg/CM-hr]\nVolume equivalency for ESM analysis, [kg/ m3]\nEquivalent system mass\nExtra-vehicular activity\nHydrogen\nInternational Space Station\nLife support system\nMass, [kg]\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nOxygen\nReverse Water-Gas Shift\n\nAerospace Engineer, ECLSS Development Branch, ES62, AIAA Member.\nAerospace Technologist, Thermal Analysis and Control Branch, EV34, Non-Member.\n3\nAerospace Engineer, ECLSS Development Branch, ES62, AIAA Member.\n4\nAnalyst, Crew and Thermal Systems Division, 2101 NASA Parkway/EC2, Houston, TX 77058, AIAA Member.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n2\n\nSLPM\nSOA\n\n= Standard liters per minute\n= State-of-the-art\n\nI. Introduction\n\nH\n\nistorically, NASA has designed and developed hardware to meet specific mission objectives, constrained to a\nlarge extent by the destination, and therefore, the duration of the mission. NASA is now looking at a future that\nmay include any number of destinations such as near earth objects, Lagrange points, and Lunar or Martian surface\nmissions, among others. Although there is some level of mission ambiguity, each of these missions will require\nreliable and robust life support systems capable of maximizing resource recovery and recycling.\nFor Atmosphere Revitalization (AR) systems, state-of-the-art (SOA) technology on the International Space\nStation (ISS) is capable of 50% theoretical recovery of oxygen (O2) from metabolic carbon dioxide (CO2). Testing\nof development-level hardware for the SOA system suggests that only about 42% O2 recovery is actually achieved.1\nThis results in a loss of over 153 kg O2 per crew member (CM) per year. For a crew of four, and assuming $55,000\nto launch one kilogram of mass to ISS ($25,000 per pound), this translates to annual launch costs of over $37.8M,\nwhen resupplied as water. For missions beyond low earth orbit, this cost will be significantly greater, making\nfrequent resupply missions prohibitive. As an alternative to SOA technology for long-duration missions, NASA is\ninvestigating Bosch-based systems capable of 100% theoretical recovery of O2 from metabolic CO2.\nIn recent years, efforts have been ongoing at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to redesign a\nBosch-based CO2 reduction system. Bosch-based systems have been a part of the NASA CO2 reduction portfolio\nsince the early 1960\xe2\x80\x99s. However, engineering challenges, most notably the large resupply requirements, carbon\ncontainment and handling difficulties, and low single-pass efficiencies, have resulted in poor comparative\nperformance with respect to alternatives with lower recovery performance (e.g. SOA with only ~42% O2 recovery\nfrom metabolic CO2).2 In an effort to address these challenges, a new approach to Bosch-based CO2 reduction has\nbeen proposed.3 In short, this approach seeks to separate the two steps in Bosch-based O2 recovery such that each\nstep can be optimized for maximum performance and provide alternative options for carbon collection/containment.\nThe first step in Bosch-based O2 recovery is the Reverse Water-Gas Shift (RWGS) reaction as shown in equation\n1 below. The second step is the carbon formation step comprised of two reactions occurring in parallel as shown in\nequations 2 and 3 below.\nCO2 + H2 \xe2\x86\x94 CO + H2O\nCO + H2 \xe2\x86\x94 C + H2O\n2CO \xe2\x86\x94 CO2 + C\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\nThe RWGS is an endothermic reaction that is kinetically and thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures.\nThe two carbon formation reactions are exothermic. These reactions are kinetically favorable at high temperatures\nbut thermodynamically favorable at lower temperatures. Thus, for an S-Bosch system, a RWGS reactor can be\noptimized to operate at high temperatures on a relatively small catalyst bed. A Carbon Formation reactor (CFr) can\nbe optimized to operate at a high temperature at the inlet to favor kinetics and a lower temperature at the outlet to\nfavor thermodynamics. Additionally, the CFr can be designed such that carbon handling/containment is much less\ncrew-intensive than previous designs, and may possibly avoid thermal cycling. The two-staged series approach to\nBosch that provides optimization at both steps in the process will theoretically result in 50-70% single-pass\nefficiencies, compared to 5-8% from traditional Bosch.\nRecent efforts in S-Bosch development have focused on system and sub-system design. Aspen modeling of a\npreliminary system architecture has provided critical information for a proposed brassboard S-Bosch. Similarly,\nCOMSOL modeling of a RWGS reactor has led to the design of a 4-crew member sized sub-system. Both of these\nefforts are detailed below.\n\nII. Series-Bosch System Architecture Model Development\nIn an attempt to facilitate ongoing hardware design efforts, modeling of both system level architecture and the\nRWGS sub-system were undertaken. The methodology for each effort is described in detail below.\nA. Series-Bosch System Architecture Model Development\nIn order to begin understanding performance in the context of a system, a Series-Bosch model was developed.\nThe model provides the capability to explore how system temperature and pressure influence the equilibrium\ncomposition. In addition, the system model was constructed in a modular format with specific subcomponent models\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nso that subcomponents can be easily added, removed, or re-located to explore design impacts. The following section\nserves to elaborate on sub-component models as well as demonstrate some results from the model.\nThe model was constructed in the Aspen Custom Modeler\xc2\xae (ACM) software package (Aspen Tech, Inc.;\nBurlington, MA). The current schematic representation is illustrated in Error! Reference source not found.. As is\nevident in the illustration, a number of sub-components exist within the system including gas source tanks for CO2\nand H2 introduction (CO2 and H2O), gas reactors (RWGS and CFR), stream mixers (Mixer1 and Mixer2),\nregenerative heat exchangers (RegenHX1 and RegenHX2), heaters (Heater1 \xe2\x80\x93 Heater4), a compressor, a condensing\nheat exchanger (CHX), a pre-compression cooling unit (PreCool), a stream splitter, and membrane separators\n(CO2Membrane and MembraneH2). Each subcomponent represented in Figure 1Figure 1 has an associated model.\nThe models for separate subcomponents vary in fidelity and will be discussed in the following sections.\n\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of S-Bosch reactor system as constructed in Aspen Custom Modeler\xc2\xae software\npackage.\n\n1. Series-Bosch Reactor Models\nThe Series-Bosch system is being deliberately designed to control the rate and location of coke formation\nthereby reducing reactor maintenance and consumables associated with catalyst replacement. Toward this objective,\nthe Bosch process is separated into a series reactor system with each reactor operating at a temperature and pressure\nmore favorable for the generation of specific products. In particular, six separate reactions are believed to occur\nduring the Bosch process.\nReverse water-gas shift:\n\n(1)\n\nCarbon dioxide methanation:\n\n(2)\n\nCarbon monoxide hydrogenation:\n\n(3)\n\nCarbon monoxide methanation:\n\n(4)\n\nCarbon methanation:\n\n(5)\n\nBoudouard reaction:\n\n(6)\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nEach equilibrium reaction has an associated equilibrium coefficient that can be manipulated through reactor\ntemperature and pressure to favor the desired products. In particular, the first reactor is operated at a higher\ntemperature and lower pressure to encourage the RWGS reaction to proceed. The second reactor is operated at a\nhigher pressure and lower temperature favoring carbon monoxide consumption.\nTo model the influence of temperature and pressure, equilibrium coefficients are calculated from a first\nprinciples approach. The temperature dependence on equilibrium is captured through the formal definition of the\nequilibrium coefficient, , expressed with respect to species activity, .\n(7)\n\n\xe2\x88\x8f\n\nIn Eq. (7),\nrepresents the stoichiometric coefficient of species\n,\nis the universal gas constant\n(8.314472 J/mol-K), and\nis the Gibbs free energy of reaction at standard temperature and pressure (0\xcb\x9aC and\n1.01325 bar). Through the definition of the free energy of reaction and enthalpy of reaction,\n, Eq. (7) is\nrelated to free energy\nand heat of formation,\n, for each species.\n[\n\n\xe2\x88\x91\n\n]\n\n(8)\n\n\xe2\x88\x91\n\nThe heat of reaction at elevated temperatures is calculated with the reactive change in mixture constant pressure\n\xe2\x88\x91\nspecific heat,\n. The component constant pressure specific heat values were determined from\npolynomial fits to experimental data annotated in elsewhere. 4\n(9)\n\n\xe2\x88\xab\n\nWith substitution of Eq. (9) into Eq. (8) and subsequent integration, the expression used in the model for the\nequilibrium coefficient calculation at elevated temperatures.\n[\n\n]\n\n[\n\n]\n\n(10)\n\nAssuming ideality since reactor pressures are far beneath the component critical pressures, the equilibrium\ncoefficient expressed in terms of component activity is related to pressure according to the following relationship.\nFinally, Eq. (11) provides a quantitative value for the equilibrium coefficient as a function of temperature, pressure,\nand component molar fraction .\n\xe2\x88\x8f(\n\n)\n\n(11)\n\nAs suggested by Eq. (11), the pressure can have a significant influence on the reactions that do not have gas-phase\nstoichiometric coefficients that sum to zero.\nFor the calculation of equilibrium composition, an extent of reaction analysis is employed.5-6 Specifically, the\nfinal molar fraction, , is determined from initial molar fraction,\n, and the extent of reaction, , for reaction\n.\n\xe2\x88\x91\n\n(12)\n\nEquations (11) and (12) provide relationships for the final composition of all species and the extent of reaction to\noccur to achieve these compositions as a function of temperature and pressure. The equations were solved\nsimultaneously with the ACM software package.\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n2. Series-Bosch Regenerative Heat Exchanger and Heater Models\nA steady-state heat exchanger model was constructed for the Series-Bosch system. With limited data on the\nactual heat exchanger to be employed for testing, specifications of which will likely follow from the analytical\nresults, a number of transfer units (\n) analysis was employed. In this analysis, the number of transfer units has\nthe following definition.\n\xcc\x87\n\n(\n\n(13)\n\n\xcc\x87 )\n\nThe denominator represents the minimum value of the cold (c) and hot (h) molar flow rates ( \xcc\x87 ) multiplied by the\nmolar specific heat of the mixture. It is necessary to take the minimum of the product of these terms in order to\ncapture the maximum physically achievable heat transfer that can occur between the working fluids. The quantity\nis the overall heat transfer coefficient multiplied by the area available for heat transfer. This quantity is not\nknown at this point. Instead, the number of transfer units is fixed to a large number (10-50) and a value for\narises\nthat would need to be achieved in practice in order to attain high heat transfer efficiencies. This value can\nsubsequently be used in evaluating existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) heat exchangers for application in the\nSeries-Bosch reactor system.\nIn addition to Eq. (13), the steady-state energy balance over the regenerative heat exchangers is as follows.\n\xcc\x87(\n\n)\n\n\xcc\x87 (\n[(\n\n)\n(\n[\n(\n\n(14)\n)\n\n(\n\n(15)\n)]\n\n(16)\n\n)\n]\n)\n\nConsequently, equations (13-16) provide all data required for the calculation of hot and cold outlet temperature\n(denoted by f for \xe2\x80\x9cfinal\xe2\x80\x9d temperature) as well as the heat exchanger requirements to attain the associated\ntemperatures as a function of\n.\nIn the case of the heater models, desired outlet temperatures are set while inlet temperatures are calculated within\nthe model. Consequently, the heat load to achieve the temperatures is calculated similar to the previous analysis\n\xcc\x87(\n(\n)).\n3. Condensing Heat Exchanger Model\nThe condensing heat exchangers (CHX and PreCool in Figure 1) were modeled similar to the heaters where a\ncooling requirement is calculated based on the desired outlet temperature (assumed to be 50 \xc2\xb0F which slightly\nexceeds the temperature of cooling water on ISS). Consequently, a heat rejection requirement is determined to cool\nthe gas to the desired temperature for subsequent chiller sizing. Moreover, an additional calculation is performed to\nassess the inlet partial pressure of water vapor versus the vapor pressure of water. Water vapor pressure was\ncalculated with the Antoine equation. The moles of water associated with the excess partial pressure of water over\nvapor pressure are presumed to condense and the molar flow rate of both water vapor and water are subsequently\ncalculated.\n4. Stream Mixer Model\nStream mixers are modeled as an adiabatic mixing process within ACM relying on built-in properties\ncalculations. Within ACM, the streams are allowed to mix and then a check is performed to assess whether any\nmaterials exist under conditions favorable for condensation. If condensation appears favorable, ACM determines the\ncomponent partitioning according to the thermodynamics properties of the system. For this analysis, the PengRobinson equation of state has been applied for thermodynamic property calculations.\n\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n5. Compressor Model\nGas compression is treated as a polytropic process in which the outlet temperature of the compressor is dictated\nby the ratio of outlet to inlet pressures.\n(17)\n( )\nIn Eq. (17), the parameter n is the polytropic expansion index characteristic of the compressor. Two limiting cases\nexist bounding the expected temperature range. Isothermal compression occurs when n=1. Conversely, adiabatic\ncompression occurs when the polytropic index is equivalent to the isentropic expansion factor for the gas,\n\xe2\x81\x84(\n(\n) 1.38 for air at standard temperature and pressure).\nIn the adiabatic case, compression results in a significant temperature rise. The compressor for the Series-Bosch\nsystem is a Dia-Vac\xc2\xae R1525700-100 (Air Dimensions, Inc.; Deerfield Beach, FL). While the exact polytropic\nexponent for this custom compressor is not known, the temperature rise observed during compression experiments\nin the laboratory seem to indicate this process is much closer to adiabatic. Consequently, the model currently\nassumes the compression process is adiabatic. When modeled under this assumption, temperatures approach levels\nthat pose a threat to the compressor diaphragm material if the gas is not cooled to threshold levels prior to\ncompression. The advantage of the system model is that it provides the means to explore cooling requirements in\ndetail from a system context. Consequently, the upfront analytical efforts are serving to tailor system design to the\nhardware that will be used during the experimental investigation.\n6. Membrane Models\nCurrently, spiral-wound membrane separator systems are under consideration from Membrane Technology &\nResearch, Inc. (Menlo Park, CA). Data such as membrane permeabilities, component selectivities, and membrane\nactivation energies are not known due to their proprietary nature. Consequently, a high fidelity membrane model\ndoes not exist. As a placeholder until experimental characterization can yield this data, the CO2 membrane is\npresumed to achieve 80% recovery while the H2 membrane assumes 60% recovery. These assumptions were\nsuggested by the vendor as reasonable approximations while the custom membrane separators are being fabricated.\n\nB. Reverse Water-Gas Shift Sub-System Model Development\nComputational models of the RWGS reactor were developed\nusing COMSOL 4.1. The models were designed to capture the\nkey features of the experimental setup while also allowing\nsimulations of a larger-scale system. The computational geometry\nis shown in Figure 2. For this effort, the system was modeled in\ntwo dimensions with symmetry about the reactor axis (r=0). The\ngeometry included five entities: the tube interior, the porous\ncatalyst (at the center of the tube), two insulating disks of porous\nquartz batting (one on either end of the catalyst), and the tube\nwall. Points along the length of the tube were marked to identify\nthe boundaries of the heated furnace, the insulation, etc. (e.g. pt7,\npt10, etc). Properties of the porous materials were obtained from\nthe manufacturer and from laboratory tests. The catalyst was\nmodeled as porous nickel with a void fraction of 0.972 and\npermeability of 6.65e-10 m2. The insulation disks were modeled as\nporous quartz with a void fraction of 0.9 and a permeability of\n1.42e-10 m2. The tube wall was modeled as solid quartz. The inlet\nFigure 2. RWGS reactor computational\nflow consisted of a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and\ngeometry. Points on the outer wall mark the\nhydrogen, which entered well-mixed.\nboundaries of the heated furnace area and\nThree COMSOL physics modules were used in this model:\ninsulation.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFree and Porous Media Flow\xe2\x80\x9d for the fluid mechanics, \xe2\x80\x9cHeat\nTransfer in Porous Media\xe2\x80\x9d for heat transfer, and \xe2\x80\x9cTransport of Dilute Species\xe2\x80\x9d for chemistry. Fluid behavior was\nmodeled as laminar flow with no slip at the wall. The fluid enters the system with a fully developed laminar velocity\nprofile. Several modes of heat transfer were included: conduction within the solid tube wall and porous materials,\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nconvection within the fluid stream, free convection with the hot furnace and cool ambient air at the outer surface of\nthe tube, and radiation exchange with the furnace and ambient environment at the outer surface of the tube (though\nradiation effects were found to be very minor). Chemical reactions, which occur in the catalyst region, were\nmodeled as one-step reversible Arrhenius reactions.\n\nIII. Results and Discussion\nAspen and COMSOL modeling were conducted to facilitate the design of a brassboard S-Bosch system. The\nresults of these modeling efforts are detailed below.\nA. Series-Bosch System Architecture Model Results\nSubcomponent models for the hardware comprising the Series-Bosch process have been developed in an effort to\noptimize performance from a system context. Consequently, a wide variety of operational scenarios can be rapidly\nexplored lending insight into expected system performance under a variety of conditions. This section presents some\nmodel verification experiments as well as expected results for various pressures and temperatures not explored in the\nlaboratory.\n1. Reverse Water-Gas Shift Reactor Verification\nA comprehensive reactive-flow computational fluid dynamics analysis has been performed for the reverse watergas shift reactor. The analysis indicates equilibrium outlet concentrations can be attained at the temperature and\npressure under consideration so long as the reactor dimensions are chosen appropriately. From the perspective of the\nsystem model, this suggests the equilibrium analysis described in the methodology is appropriate.\nAs a verification of the equilibrium reactor model, simulation results were compared against experimental data\npreviously collected at MSFC. In particular, results were collected for a sub-scale reactor with approximately 10.1\ncm (4 inches) of catalyst packed in a\ntube of 4.6 cm (1.81 inches) ID. The\nreactor was heated to 650 \xc2\xb0C (1200\n\xc2\xb0F) with a flow rate of 0.180\nstandard liters per minute (SLPM).\nHydrogen to carbon dioxide molar\nratio was varied from 0.4 to 0.8\nH2:CO2. Outlet composition was\nassessed\nvia\nmicro-gas\nchromatography. A comparison\nbetween experimental and model\nresults is illustrated in Figure 3.\nAs demonstrated in Figure 3,\nmodel and experimental results are\nin good agreement. Moreover, as the\nH2:CO2 ratio\nincreases\nCO2\nFigure 3. Experimental verification of the Series-Bosch reverse water-gas shift\nconcentration\nis\ndramatically\nreactor model. Results were collected in a sub-scale reactor with a 1.81\xe2\x80\x9d ID\nreduced. Conversely, with an\nreactor with 4\xe2\x80\x9d of catalyst. The flow rate for the experiment was 0.180 SLPM with\nincrease in the ratio of H2:CO2,\na reactor temperature of 1200 \xc2\xb0F (650 \xc2\xb0C) at a pressure of 14.7 PSIA (1.01325\nwater concentration tends to\nbar).\nincrease\nalthough\nnot\nas\nsignificantly as CO2 decreases which indicates the reactions in Eq. (2) through Eq. (6) do have an impact on\ncomposition. The results from this analysis are encouraging with respect to the predictive capability of the model to\nsimulate the chemistry in the Series-Bosch system RWGS reactor. The CFr model is constructed through a similar\nanalysis. However, the data for model verification has not been collected at this point. Until that data is acquired, it\nis presumed that the analytical approach is correct although any data generated by the model is still considered\npreliminary until properly verified.\n2. Feed-ratio, Temperature, and Pressure Parametric Analyses\nWith experimental data verifying the approach to analyzing the steady-state reaction equilibrium, the system\nmodel now provides a means to parametrically analyze the system for optimal operating specifications. Eq. (10) and\n(11) suggest that reactor temperatures and pressures are important in determining equilibrium composition.\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nMoreover, the Bosch reaction requires two moles of hydrogen to convert a mole of carbon dioxide to products.\nAccording to this stoichiometry, it is also apparent that the H2:CO2 molar feed ratio also dictates steady-state CO2\nconversion. As a result, it was determined that a parametric analysis should be performed on the temperature and\npressure of both reactors as well as the feed ratio.\nA full-factorial parametric analysis was performed in this investigation for five separate parameters: (1)\ntemperature of the RWGS reactor, (2) pressure of the RWGS reactor, (3) temperature of the CFr, (4) pressure of the\nCFr, and (5) molar feed ratio of H2:CO2. It was previously determined that lower pressures favor completion of the\nRWGS reaction while higher pressures were optimal for the reactions relevant to the CFr. In the factorial analysis,\npressure was varied across 4 levels (0.172-0.276 bar (2.5-4.0 PSIA) for the RWGS and 0.483-0.689 bar (7.0-10.0\nPSIA) for the CFr). The numerical stability for the reactor system was found to be poor when large perturbations in\ntemperature were forced on the reactors presumably due to the orders of magnitude the equilibrium coefficients vary\neven across narrow temperature ranges. For the factorial analysis, this means the temperature dependence needed to\nbe assessed across many more levels than pressure. Consequently, 12 levels were chosen since it was experimentally\ndetermined to maximize stability while balancing computational costs. For the analysis, temperatures of 625-675 \xc2\xb0C\nwere chosen for the RWGS and 475-525 \xc2\xb0C for the CFr discretized to twelve nodes. For feed ratio, stoichiometry\nsuggests that of a ratio of H2:CO2 of 2 is optimal. In reality, the Bosch reaction does not proceed according to a the\nidealized overall equation but instead proceeds according to the reactions represented in Eq. (1-6) to varying degrees\nof completion giving rise to the observed equilibrium composition. Consequently, 2 may not be the optimal molar\nfeed ratio and this parameter was varied from 1 to 2 to 3.\nBased on the factorial analysis number of factors (5) and levels (4 levels for 2 pressure settings; 12 levels for 2\ntemperature settings; 3 levels for molar feed ratio), a total of 6,912 calculations were involved in the analysis.\nMoreover, uniformly distributed random noise was added to the temperature and pressure settings to increase variety\nin the data for the purposes of subsequent multivariate regression. For the analysis, the uniformly distributed noise\nwas bounded by \xc2\xb10.003 bar (\xc2\xb10.05 PSIA) and \xc2\xb10.5 \xc2\xb0C for the pressure and temperature settings. Results for this\nanalysis are demonstrated in Figure 4. After performing the calculations, the data was regressed to develop a model\n\nFigure 4. Left: Combinatorial investigation for Series Bosch Reactor System. Surface plots generated from multi-variate\nregression on feed ratio, temperature and pressure of the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactor, and temperature and\npressure of the RWGS reactor, and temperature and pressure of the CFr. Right: Incremental calculations for the S-Bosch\nreactor system to optimize CO2 conversion as a function of reactor temperatures and feed ratio. Marker color is\nassociated with the percent conversion of CO2.\n\nrelating feed ratio and temperatures and pressures to conversion. Regression processing resulted in p-values for all\ncoefficients. With a p-value of less than 0.05, the null hypothesis that a given factor does not influence reactor\nconversion was disregarded. While the model is indeed sensitive to pressure, the p-values associated with the\npressure coefficients where greater than 0.05. This indicates that although pressure does deterministically influence\nconversion in the model, the model is far less sensitive to reactor pressures than to temperature and feed ratio for the\npressure ranges evaluated in the parametric analysis.\nIn Figure 4, the ratio of H2:CO2 molar feed dramatically influences the percent conversion of carbon dioxide as\nindicated by the separate surfaces generated with the regression model. The bottom surface is associated with a\nH2:CO2 molar feed of 1.0. In this case, the CO2 reduction reaction is hydrogen-limited and conversion is poor. The\nmiddle surface is associated with a ratio of 2. Based on reaction stoichiometry, this value would be the optimum if\nthe Bosch reaction did not proceed according to the sub reactions illustrated in equations (1-6). The top surface is\nassociated with the ratio of 3 which shows increased conversion indicating that additional hydrogen is required to\ncompletely react all of the carbon dioxide that enters the recycle loop of the series-Bosch system.\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nIn addition to generating surface plots, the multivariate regression model can be used for optimization. In\nparticular, the model regresses the 5 factors in the parametric analysis to a second order polynomial. Identifying the\nfactors (RWGS pressure, RWGS temperature, CFr pressure, CFr temperature, and feed ratio) as\nfor k = 1,\xe2\x80\xa6,5,\nthe regression model takes the following form.\n(18)\n\xe2\x88\x91\nWith the explicit 11-term expression for conversion percentage, optimization can now be performed. An objective\nfunction, f, was defined in which a minimum was sought using the Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method.\n[\n\n\xe2\x88\x91\n\n]\n\n(19)\n\nUsing the simplex method, the optimization routine predicted a minimum for f (associated with a conversion\npercentage near 100%) with a feed ratio of 2.923 and reactor temperatures of 888.0 \xc2\xb0C for the RWGS and 360.0 \xc2\xb0C\nfor the CFR. The temperature values were somewhat unexpected based on previous reactor component-level\noptimization without recycle streams. Moreover, these results are outside of the bounds in which the regression\nmodel was established. Consequently, this result requires verification with the model. However, these temperature\nvalues are a large excursion from what the model was established with, meaning the model needs to be run\nincrementally along an optimization path to arrive at the desired temperature settings. These results are in the right\npanel of Figure 4. The four dimensional plot indicates the values of reactor temperatures and feed ratio on the x, y,\nand z axes. The fourth dimension, conversion percentage, is indicated in the marker color intensity ranging from\n64.3-97.3%. Consequently, even though the regression model was employing extrapolation, the model still seemed\ncapable of predicting an optimum for CO2 conversion in this case. Consequently, the system model and optimization\nroutines provide a powerful tool for reactor system design.\nWith the high temperature requirement for the RWGS predicted by the model, additional practical considerations\nneed to be addressed including whether a heater can be sized and incorporated into the system given space\nlimitations and whether or not the high temperatures can cause damage to downstream components such as the\ndiaphragms within the compressor. These factors will continue to be addressed in the design stage. From a modeling\nstandpoint, the unconstrained optimization technique can be modified to include terms such as a maximum\nallowable\ncompressor\ntemperature\nvalue.\nHowever, this analysis demonstrates the power of\nsystem model and regression techniques.\nB. Reverse Water-Gas Shift Sub-System\nModeling Results\nThe RWGS sub-system modeling effort was\ncompleted in phases. The first phase of the effort\nfocused\non\nsimulating\nlaboratory-scale\ndimensions, allowing verification of the model\nbefore scaling to a larger RWGS sub-system. The\nsecond phase of the effort focused on modeling a\nfull-scale RWGS sub-system to explore the\ngeneral performance. The final phase of the effort\nattempted to optimize the full-scale RWGS subsystem to facilitate sizing and other design\nconsiderations.\n\nFigure 5.\nExperimental and computational centerline\ntemperatures for various furnace setpoints.

Simulations at Laboratory-Scale Dimensions\nThe first simulations with the computational\nmodel were for systems with dimensions and\nconditions\ncomparable\nto\nthe\nexisting\nexperimental system, for the purpose of validating\nthe model against experimental data. The quartz\nreactor tube was given a length of 61 cm (24 inches), with an inner diameter of 4.6 cm (1.81 in) and wall thickness\nof 0.05 cm (0.02 in). The 30.5 cm (12 in) length in the middle of the tube was exposed to the hot furnace air at the\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nouter wall boundary. On either side of this section was a 5cm (2 in) long insulated boundary (corresponding to the\ninsulation at the furnace ends), with the remaining 10cm (4 in) at each end of the tube exposed to the cool ambient\nair. The catalyst length was 15cm (6 in), and the quartz insulation disks were each 3.8 cm (1.5 in) long. The\nconvection heat transfer coefficients between the tube wall and the air in the furnace and ambient were calculated\nfrom the Grashof number and assigned a value of 7.188 W/m2K.\nOne set of simulations was intended to validate the heat transfer models. For these tests, the inlet gas flow\nconsisted of 0.5 SLPM of non-reacting CO2 entering at 25\xc2\xb0C and 1.01325 bar. The ambient air temperature was set\nto 25\xc2\xb0C at 1.01325 bar pressure. Simulations were performed with the furnace temperature set to 100, 300, 490, and\n650\xc2\xb0C, all at 1.01325 bar pressure. The reactor centerline (r = 0) temperature distributions of these simulations are\npresented in Figure 5 along with experimental measurements at locations from the center of the catalyst (z = 0) to\nthe exit of the tube (z = 12). The experimental measurements for 100\xc2\xb0C were for a non-insulated tube, the\nmeasurements for 490\xc2\xb0C and 650\xc2\xb0C were for a tube with insulation from the furnace exit to the end of the tube, and\nthe measurements for 300\xc2\xb0C included both insulated\nand non-insulated cases. The model shows\ntemperature elevations that are localized around the\nfurnace and very uniform within the furnace area.\nGas entering the heated area is warmed to the\nfurnace temperature over a relatively short distance,\nkeeps a consistent temperature throughout the\nfurnace area, and quickly cools after leaving the\nfurnace. The experimental and computational\ntemperature curves are generally similar, though\nthere are some differences in the experimental\ntrends. The experimental data shows a temperature\ndistribution that is less uniform within the furnace,\nand rapid cooling of the exiting gases starting earlier\nin the experimental data \xe2\x80\x93 before the gas fully exits\nthe furnace. Both of these trends suggest an air leak\nnear the furnace exit that allows cooler ambient air\ninto the heated area. However, in general there is\ngood agreement between the experimental and\ncomputational trends, suggesting that the model\ncaptures the essential elements of the heat transfer.\nAdditional simulations were performed to test the\nchemistry models. The catalyst length was set to 10\ncm (4 in). The temperatures of the furnace air and\nambient air were 650\xc2\xb0C and 25\xc2\xb0C, respectively, at a\npressure of 1.01325 bar. The inlet gas stream\nconsisted of well-mixed H2 and CO2 entering at 25\xc2\xb0C\nand 1.01325 bar pressure, with a total flow rate of\n0.18 SLPM. Simulations were performed with the\ninlet H2:CO2 ratio set to 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8.\nThe results of the simulations are presented with\nthe experimental concentration levels at the exit in\nFigure 6. The model results show a very rapid\nprogression to equilibrium upon entering the catalyst\nregion. The model shows the expected final\nconcentrations from equilibrium data for this\nreaction. In the experimental case, however, the\nconsumption of reactants is greater than what would\nbe expected in an equilibrium case. A small degree\nof uncertainty is inherent in the experimental data.\nEven so, the progression of the experimental\nreactions past the expected equilibrium, combined\nwith the detection of trace amounts of methane,\nraises the possibility of secondary reactions not\nFigure 6.

The small discrepancies suggest that these\neffects are minor, however. On the whole, the computational results show a good degree of agreement with the\nexperimental data and theoretical predictions of equilibrium composition.\n2. Full-Scale RWGS Sub-System Behavior\nWith the validation tests complete, we next performed simulations of a\nfull-scale reactor. The intent of these tests was to gain insight into trends\nin the fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and chemistry of the system, and to\ndetermine what aspects of the design might need to be revised for larger\nscales. At full scale, the reactor is estimated to have an inlet flow of 1.412\nSLPM of H2 and 3.295 SLPM of CO2, or double these values with flow\nrecycling. For these tests, only the inlet gas stream was changed; the\ndimensions and external conditions of the system remained the same as in\nthe laboratory scale system, with a 15cm (6 in) catalyst length and 650\xcb\x9aC\nfurnace temperature. The inlet gas stream was set up with the properties\nneeded for full-scale operation with recycling: a temperature of 25\xc2\xb0C, a\nreduced pressure of 0.207 bar (3.1 psi), and a well-mixed flow consisting\nof 2.824 SLPM of H2 and 6.590 SLPM of CO2.\nFigure 7 shows the velocity distribution in the gas stream. The open\nsections of the tube show the\nexpected laminar distribution,\nwith high velocities at the\ncenterline and lower velocities\nnear the walls. Within the\nporous media of the catalyst and\ninsulation disks, however, the\nvelocity is much more uniform,\na desirable trait to promote\nuniform reaction progress. It is\ninteresting to note that this\ntransition is not instantaneous.\nFigure 7. Velocity magnitudes\nFigure 8 highlights the entrance\nthroughout the system.

Placing even a small amount of porous material such as this one\nupstream of the catalyst helps to provide a much more uniform\ndistribution of velocities for the catalyst section.\nFigure 9 shows the temperature distribution in the system. The existing\nfurnace setup is effective at heating the catalyst region, but the\ntemperature elevation is somewhat localized to that area. In the upstream\nregion, heating occurs only near the walls prior to the porous region.\nDownstream of the furnace, the flow is cooled rapidly through convective\nlosses to the wall and ambient air. Within the porous region, however, the\ntemperature is much more uniform, due in large part to the high thermal\nFigure 8.

Full-Scale Sub-System Optimization\nOur last simulations with the COMSOL model were intended to identify optimum catalyst dimensions for a fullscale system. Ideally, the system should be designed such that the gas temperature in the catalyst has minimal\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 9. Temperature distribution\ninside full-scale reactor.\n\nvariation, ensuring uniform reaction rates, and the residence time is\nsufficient to achieve the desired reaction completion throughout the flow. To\nthis end, simulations were performed with the same basic design for the\nsystem, but with varying dimensions for the catalyst length and diameter.\nComputational experiments showed that the length of the catalyst section\nhad little effect on the curvature of the concentration plots, instead affecting\nonly how far the curves progressed toward equilibrium. This is primarily\nbecause the high thermal conductivity of the catalyst limits temperature\nvariations along the catalyst length, so that changing the length will affect\nthe residence time but not the reaction rate. Catalyst diameter, on the other\nhand, affects both the residence time and the distance from the heat source to\nthe catalyst center, impacting both the reaction rate and the ultimate\nprogression toward equilibrium. For this reason, the results presented here\nfocus on the effects of diameter variation on the system performance. Basic\nconditions for these tests are the same as those in the previous large-scale\nsystem test. Two inlet flows were examined: the basic full-scale flow rates of\n1.412 SLPM of H2 and 3.295 SLPM of CO2, and the flow rates with\nrecycling of 2.824 SLPM of H2 and 6.590 SLPM of CO2. The catalyst length\nwas set to 20 cm (8 in) for all cases, and the diameter was examined for sizes\nranging from the original value of 4.6cm (1.81 in) up to 25.4 cm (10 in).\nFigure 10 shows the radial temperature distribution at the upstream edge\n(or entrance) of the catalyst. Since at this point the gas stream has had the\nleast time to receive heat from the warm walls and catalyst, this point\nrepresents the worst case for temperature distribution, with all downstream\nportions being more radially uniform. The temperature at the centerline is the\nlowest since it is farthest from the warm walls, while nearer the walls the\ntemperature approaches the value for the furnace. As expected, larger\ndiameters increase the distance between the centerline and the hot walls,\nthereby depressing the centerline temperature and making the distribution\nless uniform. However, since the catalyst has high thermal conductivity, the\n\nFigure 10. Radial temperature distribution at the inlet face of the catalyst for a full-scale system without recycle. The\nlegend indicates the catalyst and tube diameter for each curve in inches.\n\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\neffect is not very large. Even at the largest diameter of 25.4 cm (10 in), the radial variation in absolute temperature is\nless than 5%. Moreover, the temperature distribution downstream only becomes more uniform as the gas receives\ndirect heating from the catalyst.\nFigure 11 shows the concentration of CO2 along the centerline of the catalyst, which provides a gauge of reaction\ncompletion. Since the centerline should have the coolest temperatures and lowest reaction rates, this too provides a\nworst case view of reaction completion. As the plot shows, several of the larger diameters approach equilibrium by\nthe end of the 20 cm (8 in) catalyst length, while diameters smaller than 12.7 cm (5 in) fall short. With little\ntemperature variation within the catalyst, the degree of reaction completion is primarily a function of the residence\ntime. Larger tubes decrease the flow speed and lengthen the residence time, though the same effect can be achieved\nwith a longer catalyst. As little as 10 cm (4 in) of catalyst is sufficient for some of the largest diameters, while a 12.7\ncm (5 in) diameter needs a full 20 cm (8 in) of length. In principle a long enough catalyst would allow even the\nsmaller diameters to reach equilibrium, though this would also require lengthening the furnace. With the existing\nequipment, a 12.7 cm (5 in) diameter tube and catalyst should be sufficient to achieve the desired level of reaction\ncompletion for a basic full-scale system.\n\nFigure 11. Axial CO2 concentrations along the catalyst centerline (r = 0) for a full-scale system without recycling. The\nlegend indicates the catalyst and tube diameter for each curve in inches.\n\nFigure 12 and Figure 13 show results for the recycling system. The general trends are similar, though the higher\nflow rates make this case even more demanding. Interestingly, the smallest diameters produced the worst\ntemperature uniformity. The reason for this is that the velocity is so high in these small tubes that the insulation\nmaterial is not sufficient to fully mix and even out the flow distribution before the gas reaches the catalyst. As a\nresult, at the upstream edge of the catalyst the centerline receives much cooler and faster-moving fluid, while near\nthe wall the gas stream is slower and warmer due to preheating by the warm walls. This makes the radial\ntemperature distribution much less uniform. A longer insulation section could potentially resolve this issue, and for\ndiameters of at least 10 cm (4 in) the flow speed is slow enough that the existing insulation is sufficient to limit the\nvelocity distribution at the catalyst entrance. At this point, the temperature distributions are not much worse than in\nthe non-recycling case. The demands of a doubled flow rate make chemical equilibrium more difficult to achieve as\nwell, as seen in Figure 13. The trends in the concentration profiles are essentially the same as for the non-recycling\ncase, but a larger diameter of at least 20 cm (8 in) is needed to approach equilibrium by the end of the catalyst.\n\n13\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 12.

Conclusions\nA steady-state equilibrium system model has been established for the Series-Bosch Reactor System. The model\naccepts reactor temperature, pressure, and feed composition inputs among a number of other parameters.\nConsequently, large-scale parametric analyses were performed for reactor optimization. As an example,\ntemperatures and feed ratios were employed as inputs for the parametric analysis described in this work. A\nmultivariate regression model was subsequently generated from the parametric analysis results to predict CO2\nconversion. Unconstrained Nelder-Mead optimization was performed with the regression model in order to\nmaximize percent conversion. The regression model predicted reasonable values for temperatures and feed ratio\nalbeit the temperatures were outside of the bounds used to generate the model. Consequently, a verification study\nwas performed to assess and confirm that the regression and system models were in agreement.\nA COMSOL-based RWGS model was established to facilitate full-scale sub-system design for Series-Bosch\nsystem. The model varied temperature, pressure, length, and diameter in an attempt to optimize a reactor for\noperation both with and without gas recycle. The model suggested that diameter was a much more influential\nparameter than length for approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Additionally, a design involving quartz\ninsulation at the inlet of the reactor provides the benefit of flow distribution prior to entrance into the catalyst.\nWhile results from the unconstrained optimization studies were encouraging, practical considerations need to be\nevaluated prior to acceptance of the results. This work is ongoing and will likely require optimization constraints\nassociated with specific hardware requirements.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the Office of the Chief Technologist Next Generation Life Support\nProject for funding this effort.
