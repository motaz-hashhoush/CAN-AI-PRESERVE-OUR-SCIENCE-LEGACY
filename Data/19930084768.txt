The\nthird route from Toulouse occupies twodays\n\nand covers a distance of 1,850 kilometreg\n-say1,50mile.\nThe first day\'s journey is from Toulouse to\nAlicante via Barcelona, the departure being\n90\' clock in the morning, the destination being\nreached at 3.15 in the afternoon the next\nday the departure is made at 8 o\'clock from\nAlicante, and the arrival at Casablanca is at\n3 . 45 in the afternoon.\nFigure A gives the map of these routes. It\nis interesting to observe on this map how\nEurope is cut up from an air point of view by\nthe Alps and the eastern extensions. The\ncrossing of these mountain ranges must\npresent great difficulties from the air point\nof view for very many years to come.\n(3) The results in passengers carried and\nefficiency of the service.\nI have taken as an example the London\xe2\x80\x94\nParis route, as more attention has been given\nto this than the two other routes, and it,\ntherefore, serves as an illustration of the way\nin which the traffic has developed.

The first is the great similarity\nbetween the passenger distribution for the\ndifferent months in any given year. The\nhigh peak attained in July and August of\neach year indicates either that the service is\nlargely composed of tourists, or that weather\nconditions . or the longer days of summer\npermit of flying and, therefore, more services\nto be run. All of these causes, no doubt,\noperate to produce the effect shown. Very\nnoteworthy are the low figures of passengers\ncarried in the four months November, December, January and February, a result largely\ndue to the number of days on which flying\nis prevented owing to fog and bad visibility.\nThe increase, in traffic in succeeding years is\nnegligible for these months compared with\nthe big increases in the summer months.\nThis disparity between traffic in winter and\nsummer working must be evened up if air\ntransport is to be an economic proposition.\nIt would be interesting to have a comparison\nof the seasonal variations of passenger\ntraffic in other forms of transport.\nThe results for 1922 are particularly\ninteresting. For , this year, three British\ncompanies were in competition, and two\nFrench, and a great deal of publicity was\ngiven to the services. This competition\nstarted from April 1st. Prior to that, the\ncurve shows that there was an increase in\npassenger traffic over 1921, a year of exceptionally fine weather, In April, a collision\n\n33\n45\n86\n408\n559\n686\n841\n920\n592\n560\n274\n176\n\n23\n45\n269\n338\n470\t\n746\n766\n817\n362\n279\n118\n60\n\n56\n90\n355\n746\n- 1,029\n1,432\n1,607\n1,737\n954\n839\n392\n236\n\n113\n183\n380\n577\n\'808\n769\n1,011\n1,722\n1,053\n519\n206\n186\n\n39\n85\n178\n174\n259\n174\n261\n322\n329\n351\n73\n75\n\nI\n\nTotal.\n152\n268\n558\n751\n1,067\n943\n1,272\n2,044\n1,382\n870\n279\n261\n\nin the air occurred in France, a machine\noperated by the Daimler Hire, Ltd., colliding\nwith one belonging to the Compagnie dos\nGrand Express Aeriens, and, in consequence,\nthe adverse effect is shown in the April\nfigures, which drop below those of 1921.\nThe good results of the next few weeks\'\nworking helped . to make this accident forgotten, so that, in May, the figures for I92I\nand 1922 are approximately equal. In June,\na Spad belonging , to theCompagnio dos\nGrand Express Aerieis fell into the \'sea off\nFlkestone, the pilot and three passengers\nbeing killed. The effect of this accident is\nagain .shown in the June and July figures,\nthese falling below those of 1921. An\nexamination of the weather figures for 1922\nfor these months does not afford any meteorological explanation for the fall in passengers.\nIn August, September and October, the\nadverse effect of the accidents is no longer\nfelt and the numbers increase. These figures\nare \'interesting as showing the effect of (a)\nfog and bad weather conditions, and (b)\naccidents, upon the resulting traffic. More\nimportant than all, it is interesting to see the\nway in which the traffic has grown.\nI have\' given the number of passengers\nwho in these years travelled by British\nmachines, and the figures for both the total\npassengers, as well as the British passengers,\nare given in Tables i and 2 for\' the\nthree years. In 1920, 80 per cent.\' of the\npassengers went by British machines. In\n1921, the number of British machines was\nrestricted owing to the subsidy. conditions\n\nTABLE 2.\nMONTHLY RECORD OF FLIGHTS CARRIED OUT ON LONDON-PARIS ROUTE BY BRITISH AND \r\nFRENCH AIRCRAFT.\n\n1920.\nBritish.

It is a matter for gratification to us in this country that this preference is accorded to British machines.\nIt might be claimed that this preference is\ndue to the nationality of the passengers, for\npractically all the passengers are either\nEnglish of American and, as such, might\nprefer to travel by a company with an\nEnglish-speaking personnel. No doubt this\nhas some influence on the traffic, but the\ngreater regularity and reliability of the English services is without doubt the primary\ncause.\nTABLE 3.\n\nEFFICIENCY* OF BRITISH AIR SERVICES ON THE\r\nLONDON-PARIS AIR ROUTE.\n\n1922.\n\nJanuary\t ...\t\nFebruary\t\n...\t\nMaxch\t\nApril\t\n...\t\nMay\t\n...\t\nJune\t .\t ...\t\nJuly\t\n...\t\nAugust\t ...\t\nSeptember\t\nOctober\t ...\t\nNovember...\t\nDecember\t\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n..\n\n42.1\n68\n71.4\n76.7\n- 78.6\n85.3\n75.3\n89.4\n86\n87.3\n78.5\n61.8\n\n58.3\n76\n95.4\n-\t 94.8\t .\n94.7\n91\n93.8\n94.8\n93\n92.9\n71\n71.6\n\n65.9-.\n92.9\n93.9\n92.3\n92.3\n95.2\n95.2\n95.4\n89.5\n84.6\n-\n\n* Per cent. to total flights commenced of flights\n\xc3\xa7othpleted in less than-four hours.\t\n-\n\n48\n48\n102\n104\n161\n211\n193\n222\n167\n148\n110\n51\n\n1922.\nTotal.\n63\n73\n136\n162\n237\n323\n352\n377\n278\n254\n184\n119\n\nBritish.

The argument deduced\nis that the country\'s money is wasted in\nsubsidies merely to provide such pleasure\ntrips. There is, however, another side to the\nargument. If it is a national necessity to\nhave a reserve of machines in the air and\npilots and mechanics in training, the cost to\nthis country of such service is diminished by\nthe amount of the contribution made by such\npassengers, and the greater the number of\npassengers from abroad who patronise and\npay for the service, the greater the proportion\nof the contribution paid for from abroad.\nThe figures given above relate to the\nLondon-Paris air service and have been\ntaken as - typical; more passengers travel\non this route than on any other.\nThe results from these French lines are\ngiven in Tables 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and are\nexceedingly interesting, especially on the\nCasablanca route. Here there is a clear\nindication of the gradual patronage by the\npublic for postal purposes of the service\nwhen the saving of time becomes appreciated\nby the public.\n\n\'7\nTABLE 4.\nTRAFFIC UPON THE PARIS, BRUSSELS, AMSTERDAM AIR ROUTE IN \r\nFRENCH, BELGIAN OR DUTCH AIRCRAFT.\n\nFlights\nmade,\n1919\t\n...\n...\n1920\t\n...\n1921\t\n...\n1922\t\nup to 31st\nOct., 1922)\n\n497\n388\n814\n503\n\nKilometres\nflown.\n101,789\n110,245\n310,710\n138,615\n\n(4) The costs of the service.\nAir transport, to be successful, must not\nbe too expensive, although, owing to its\nhigh speed, a higher price can be obtained\nthan for slower means of transportation.\nThe largest portion of the cost, when the\nservice is small, is the over expense and\ngeneral establishment charg e s, which cannot\nbe reduced below a certain amount. These\nreach a high figure per passenger when the\nservice is small. The capital of the transport\ncompany is mostly invested in machines,\nengines and spare parts necessary for the\ncarrying on of the service, and it is essential,\nif the cost per passenger is to be kept down,\nthat the equipment should be used the\nmaximum amount possible. Aircraft in\noperation, as regards the aeroplane itself,\ncost little - to keep up, and have quite a long\nlife ; it is the motor that is the most expensive part to run. In determining the actual\ncost of running, it is, therefore, an obsolescence rather than a depreciation charge for\nthe aircraft that has to be included, the\namount to be written off per annum depending\non the rate of technical progress in aircraft.\nIt is obvious that the aircraft should be\nkept flying continuously in the service with\nno time on the ground beyond that necessary\nfor inspection, adjustment or overhaul, and\nthat there should be a sufficient supply of\nengines always available for change when they\nrequire overhaul or when a fault develops.\nThere are limits, however, imposed upon such\nsystem of operation, owing to night flying\nbeing as yet impossible commercially, and\nowing to the restricted hours of flying in\nwinter time caused by the shorter flying hours,\nalso by bad weather such as fog, etc. As\nthe services expand so will the overhead\ncharge per passenger or pound freigh t\n\n4ai(\n\nPassengers\nCarried,\n\nFreight\nin kg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94Best\nin kg.\n\n193\n371\n2,010\n1,224\n\n4,217\n1,739\n20,522\n38,183\n\n214\n225\n566\n474\n\ndecrease, and. therefore great improvement is\nto be expected along these lines.\nThe actual costs at the present day vary\nconsiderably, and are dependent on whether\nthe aircraft are used in an extensive manner,\nor whether a large fleet is used with a large\nnumber of machines in reserve but not used.\nThe cost, for instance, of the twin engine\nmachines used on the London\xe2\x80\x94Paris service\nis approximately 6s. per mile flown, and the\nsingle engine machines about 4s. 6d. This\ncorresponds to a cost per ton mile, calculated on the full load capacity of the\nmachine, of 3s. 6d. for a twin engine machine\nand 4s. 6d. to 5s. for the single engine machine\nof a similar capacity. The cost of petrol and\noil in the twin engine machine is approximately\nL4 per ho\xc3\xb1r. With an average flying speed\nof 85 miles per hour, this corresponds to\nis. per mile, or, say, 7d. per ton mile. It\nis evident, therefore, that between this\nfigure and 3s. 6d. there is an ample margin for\neconomy and improvement. These figures\nshow that the actual cost of running to-day\ndoes not depend so much upon the economy\nof the actual machine used and petrol, oil, etc.,\nor even on the question of upkeep. The cost\nof air transport to-day is mainly due to the\nminimum cost of the general charges that\nhave to be maintained if a service of any\ndescription is run.

They are as follows: Firstly-a\npolitical consideration. If a country subsidizes an international line, the aeronautical\noutlook of the countries through which that\nline passes tends, towards the same point of\nview as that of the- country subsidizing the\nservice. This might be considered as a\n\npolitical penetration to obtain a control in\naeronautical policy.\nThere is a possibility, too, of orders resulting\nfor the aircraft industry of the country\ngiving the subsidy. The latter is not,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 however, a valid reason for the subsidy being\ngiven. If the organization and running of\nsuch an international air line will benefit\nthe aeronautical industry with orders, then\nit is for the industry to subsidize the line to\nobtain the business.\nThe second reason is a military one. Even in a country where there is conscription, the\nprovision of a large enough number of pilots\nand mechanics by military training only is\na matter of difficulty. By maintaining a\nlarge number of machines in the air on\ncommercial air services, with a corresponding\nnumber of pilots and mechanics, etc., there\nis available, in time of war a reserve for\nnational emergencies. Whether this is a\nbetter means than, say, a territorial air force\nis a matter for the service experts to determine, and also is dependent upon the relative\ncost to the State of the two methods. On\nthe face of it, it would appear to the layman\nthat it would be cheaper to maintain reserves\non the civil aviation basis, as a large proportion of the cost is contributed by the public\nin the shape of the air transport companies\'\nreceipts.\nA further and more important point is\n\nI0\nTABLE 8.\nTRAFFIC ON THE TOULOUSE, CASABLANCA AIR ROUTE BY THE \r\nLATECOERE AIR LINE.\n\nFlights\nmade,\n1919\t\n1920\t\n1921\t\n1922\t\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n250\n923\n1,900\n2,270\n\nKilometres\n\nflown,\n\nPassengers\ncarried,\n\n107,470\n366,049\n692,415\n840,406\n\n41\n223\n455\n739\n\nthat, unless the public in a country is educated\nto air travel and the use of aircraft, it is impossible to develop fully an \'air sense. Military supremacy in the air will not, unless\ncivil- aviation is encouraged, come to any\nnation in the way that supremacy on the sea\nhas come to the British Empire as a result\nof the great mercantile marine development\nthat there has been always in the Empire.\nThe third reason for the giving of subsidies,\nis a. commercial one. Improvement of\ncommunication develops the resources of a\ncountry. It is especially necessary within\nthe British Empire where such large distances\nhave to be traversed. At the commencement, the cost of organisation of air communication owing to overhead charges, etc.,\nis high, and it is to help the initial lean years\nthat a subsidy is necessary. Eventually,\nhowever, from a commercial point of view\nthe subsidies must cease and the whole policy\nunderlying their grant must be to make the\nservices ultimately self-supporting.\nThe way in which subsidies should be paid\nhas been a subject of discussion in many\ncountries. From the military point of view,\nas machines have to be kept in the air and\npilots and mechanics kept in training, the\nbasis of a lump sum payment per annum for a\nminimum number of miles flown and pilots\nand mechanics kept in training, seems to be\nthe fairest one that is possible to both sides.\nFrom a commercial point of view, unless the service results in a minimum amount of\ntraffic, it has no ultimate value to the State.\nTherefore, it would appear that here again\na lump sum payment for a minimum amount\nof passenger traffic or freight obtained during\nthe year would be the most equitable basis.\nBetter still it would be if, in addition to the\nlump sum payment for the minimum traffic,\nthere were a subsidy increasing in amount the\nresults obtained; so that there was a direct\n\nFreight\nin kg.\n678\n9,948\n\' 25,555\n33,560\n\n\xe2\x80\x94Pest\nin kg.\n178\n3,417\n6,707\n24,995\n\nincentive to the further development of the\nline.\nIn Great Britain at the present time, the\nsubsidy is based on the lump sum payment\nfor a minimum number of flights made and\nmachines, pilots and mechanics kept in\ntraining. The basic reason for the subsidy in\nGreat Britain, therefore, seems to be military.\nAttached hereto are the subsidy conditions\nfor three of the French companies, with\nexamples of the sums paid per trip. A\ncomparison between the English and French\nsubsidy amounts is as striking as the discrepancy between the results achieved. It\nwould appear that some intermediate subsidy\narrangen\'ient between the two extremes which\nwe have in the two countries, would lead to\nthe most favourable development of aviation.\n(6) Probable future developments.\nThe development of civil aviation in the\nfuture from the point of view of the British\nEmpire has been most ably dealt with in\nthe report of the Air Ministry for the halfyear ended September 30th, 1921, in Appendix III, where the value to the Empire of\nair services, and the services rendered by\nthem, is dealt with very fully. I do not\npropose to go over this ground which has\nbeen so often covered.\nI have referred in the costs to the figures\nwhich obtain to-day, namely, approximately\n3s. 6d. per ton mile. If civil aviation is to\nrun on its own feet, without subsidy, although\nthe first necessity is expansion of services so\nas to reduce .overhead charges per passenger\nor per lb. of freight, yet, \'at the same time,\nthere is ample scope for improvement in\nmachines. To-day, the average covered\naircraft carries between 15 and 17 lbt for\nevery horse-power installed, of which, at the\noutside, 4 to 5 1bper horse-power is the\nuseful or paying \'load. The cruising speed\n\n\t\n\nII\n\nCommercial profits subsidy.\nvaries between 85 and ioo miles per hour.\nIt should not be impossible within the next\nPassengers ...
