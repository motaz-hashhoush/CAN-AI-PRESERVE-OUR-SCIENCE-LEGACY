The main difficulty with the 1 \xc2\xb5 powders\nis the difficulty of keeping them in suspension in the teflon long\nenough for the resultant slurry to be usefully applied to a Ni mesh.\nOn the other hand the 0.1 p powders, while easier to handle, must\nbe at higher temperatures carefully protected from air,and its preparation\nis relatively prolonged and involved.\nWe have used this particular catalyst to learn a lesson that\nought to apply to all other catalysts of this class, i.e. blacks.\nA problem both present and future 1s the following: when does\none stop trying to improve on past performance? For instance at\npresent while the best performances are very good indeed, PRA thinks\nthat another large factor (3-5) in current may still be missing, due\nto still imperfect mounting techniques.\nThus comparison may have to be limited to comparison between\ntwo similarly handled materials rather than comparison between optimized\nresults.\nOur demountable fuel cells are presently duplicating results\nquite well, and confidence in our results is consequently higher.\n\npage 2\nl\nA. Metallurgy\nThe crystal puller has been slowed down so that speeds of\nthe order of 5 mm/h are possible. The best we could do before was about\n2.5 cm/h. The resulting boules are more uniform and tend to be composed\nof larger crystals. In an effort to achieve better uniformity we have\nalso added a smoothing run.\nDuring the last period we have prepared a number of crystals\nincluding a final run on AuCu + 22 at % Al.\nWe have also produced two crystals of AuCu + 22 at % Ga and\nIn respectively. These will be ground and used for electrodes as soon\nas the present tests on AuCu + Al are completed.\nIt is our intention to complete the study of brittle\nmaterials during the next period. The first run of AuCu 3 with the same\npercentage of dopants that had produced brittle materials before are\nstill ductile. At some level of impurity they will become brittle, too.\nThese crystals will be rerun with added impurities.\nAs regards face centered materials we have found that these\ncan be ground using suitable surfactants down to suitable sizes,\nprovided the initial powder size does not exceed a maximum limit of the\norder of 30 p. The problem therefore of producing powders ,3 easier\nthan it was thought originaU v,particularly as most methods of direct\nfine powder production appear very difficult to use with very high\ntemperature materials although they work very well with iow\ntemperature materials. This is because most mechanical devices do not\nperform when overheated, in this case, by radiation.\n\nPage 3\n\nWe expect to use a spinning disk on which a stream of molten\nmetal is impinged. This disk can be driven from outside the vacuum and\nthus completely avoid the direct heating problem of the spinning motor.\nA large proportion of resulting powder is expected to be in the 30 \xc2\xb5\nregion and therefore suitable for direct grinding.\n\nB.\t\n\nPowder Production\n\nAt present the crystals are first sawed down to a suitable\nsize and cracked in the\n\nmetallurgical mortar. Such portions of the\n\ncracking that pass through a 35 mesh sieve are ground in two grinders\n(Fisher mortar grinder) in aluminum oxide mortars. At the end of two\ndays grinding one achieves, this way, a powder Whose size centered\naround 5 \xc2\xb5 but which has a relatively large size distribution. The\ncoarse sizes are separated by filtering, using a Buchner funnel and\nfilters of calibrated fineness. The section below 5 \xc2\xb5 can now be\nhandled in either of the following two ways.\n\nIf a uniform 1 \xc2\xb5 size is desired it is sufficient to grind\nit in a tungsten carbide mortar, using water as a lubricant -- 6 hours\nof grinding being sufficient.\nIf, however, a 0.1 \xc2\xb5 size is desired, the 5 \xc2\xb5 material is\nground in tungsten carbide mortar using ethyl alcohol as a lubricant and\na surfactant. The first surfactant we used on the basis of information\nobtained from (1) wixe aluminum nitrate. This produced beautifully\nuniform material of the desired size, but it proved nearly impossible\nto remove the aluminum nitrate from it and unfortunately the aluminum\nis a strong poison to an oxygen catalyst.\n\n\t\n\npage 4\n\nWe were fortunate enough to try triton x-100 as a surfactant,\nand this appears to be completely satisfactory giving a material which\nis consistent with the treatment it will undergo to produce an electrode.\nAll materials so obtained have to be etched in KOH to remove\nsurface impurities and possible traces of excess dopants originally\nlocated in the intercrystalline spaces. When this is done, after\nfiltering, the 1 \xc2\xb5 material is ready for the next process. The 0.1 \xc2\xb5\nmaterial, on the other hand, reagglomerates during the KOH etching and\nmust undergo a final light grinding again using ethyl alcohol and x-100.\nC.\t\n\nElectrode Preparation\n\n1. 1 u Powders\nf-\t\nAs already mentioned 1 p powders turned out to be very\ndifficult to use because their relatively great mass makes it practically\nimpossible to suspend them in teflon solution and to produce a suitable\nslurry.\nAbout the only method that could be used was to spray a\nmuch diluted teflon suspension, while continuously agitating the\ncontainer. In this way, which however proved to be extremely wasteful\nin time and material, the better electrodes were obtained.\nTwo-inch disks of 75 mesh (several other meshes were\ntried, but we finally concentrated on this) 7.5 mil wire Ni screen were\nplaced against a magnetic chuck. A stream of hot air was directed at\nthe same time as the spray and the spraying continued in short bursts.\nThe precedingly deposited material was air dried. The results so\nobtained will be discussed in Section D.\n\nrage 5\nc\nIn order to increase the surface tension and the\nviscosity of the suspension, several additives were tried,\ncharacteristically toluene. None of these was sufficiently effective\nto improve the handling of this powder.\nPossibly the addition of x-100,which was later used\nto improve the suspension of 0.1 \xc2\xb5 powder, may have some beneficial\neffects.\n2. 0.1 u Powders\nAt this moment we suspend the 0.1 \xc2\xb5 powder in the\nfollowing manner which has proved the most satisfactory.\nFor an average loading for a 2 " disk of 75 mesh 7.5\nmil wire Ni screen 1 g of 0.1 \xc2\xb5 size powder is mixed with 0.3 ml water,\n0.075 ml teflon 30 suspension, and 0.1 ml x-100. This mixture combines\nto a slurry which is applied with an artist\'s brush to the wire screen,\nair dried, and sintered under argon at 3750C for 15 minutes.\n\nFor thinner wire screens an alternative method has been\nadopted. The 1 g of 0.1 p size powder is mixed with 0.075 ml teflon 30\nsuspension and water added adlib. This mixture is heated at a temperature\nclose to 1000C till a rubbery dough forms which is then rolled onto the\nscreen. This then is sintered under argon at 2750C.\nAll screens are goldplated before mounting the powders.\n\nit\n\nr\n\npage E\n\nults\n\nD. Res\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\nAll materials were tested in demountable tefion cells which\nuntil recently proved quite troublesome, mainly because of gas leaks,\nwhich tended to dry the electrolyte and rendered the cell inoperative.\nThe cells could be heated and the temperature recorded by\na thermocouple in a Varian two-pen recorder. The other pen recorded\nthe voltage across a series of fixed loads versus time. The cell was\na completely self-enclosed system, so the actual pressure difference\nat the electrodes which allowed the influx of the gases was directly\n\nproportional to the rate of combustion of the gases. The gunge\npressure was kept normally around 15 lbs., but the results were quite\nInsensitive to variation of pressure because of the above reason, save\nwhen a change in pressure caused a more advantageous interface to\nestablish itself between electrolyte and catalyst. When this occurred,\n-e\ncharacteristically in the case of thin screens, t% current would\nsignificantly increase by reducing the o-pressure to -- say 7 lbs.\nGraph # 1 compares the best results obtained with 1 and 0.1 p\npowders. The 0.1 p curve doubles at each voltage of interest the curves\nobtained for 1 p. While the results obtained for .1 \xc2\xb5 would in general\nbe considered quite acceptable for an 0 electrode, the following\nconsiderations cause us to hope that considerable further improvements\ncould be otained. Whether you consider that the increment in current\ndue to the reduced catalyst size is due to the increased surface or\nalternatively due to the increased number of channels available in the\nelectrode for both electrolyte and gas, the resulting current should be\nlinear inversely to the size of the material. We would expect this to\nresult in better than a factor of 2 improvement for a factor of 10\nreduction of material size and are distantly hopeful that a further\nincrease in current will materialize.\n\npage\n\n7\n\nAft\n\nGraph # 2 shows the best and an average 1 \xc2\xb5 curve.\nRegrettably these were not produced with the same precautions as became\nnecessary to use for the 0 . 1 \xc2\xb5, because apparently they did not need\nthem. For i%stance they did not appear to oxidize when heated to 2750C\nin atmosphere.\nGraph # 3 shows a collection of curves produced using .1 \xc2\xb5\npowder. The two lower-most curves which :.now high open voltages but\ndiminished ability to sustain high currents were probably somewhat\noxidized during preparation.\n# 3 0 , which is the topmost curve, differs from the others\nby being curved under argon. The other eurves,intermediate between the\nbest and the worst, represent various changes in technology, the most\nimportant of which was that they were cured under N 2 . Under the\nconditions of our experiments Ar t is a much surer way to displace the\nair i.n the oven than N 2 . As a result these intermediate curves are\nall probably somewhat oxidized. Nevertheless they all exceed\n200 mA/cm2 at 0.8 V.\nIn the immediate future, as already mentioned, this work\nshall be ccupleted, following the schedule on pp. 4-5 which appears to\nbe the best on thy- basis of our experience. However, the loading will\n\nbe systematically changed, with all electrodes produced simultaneously\nwith as similar conditions as possible.\nIt does not appear to us that the loading can be arbitrarily\nincreased, presumably because the pores in the -.eavier lo+^:Ing may become\nmore frequently discontinuous. If this is the ::P, an optimal loading\nshould exist and we should be able to find it. A few additional\nelectrodes at, optimal loading will be produced with every effort to\nmaintain all variables as constant as possible to see what the range of\nvariation might be.\n\npage 8\n\nE.\t\n\nFuture Work\n\nDuring the next period we expect to finish comparing the\nperformance of brittle materials including not only the Ga and In\ndoped AuCu already prepared but also AuCu 3 doped with Al, Ga, I n, and\nAg, similarly doped.\nShorn in Fig. 1 is a print of our new metal fuel cell\nwhich will be ready for testing in a few days. When adopted these cells\nwill completely substitute for the teflon demountables so far used\nand with suitable modifications be used as premanent as well as\n\ndemountable cells.\nWork will continue on the pulverization of face centered\nmaterials. As mentioned before, conditions can be considerably relaxed.\nr\t\n\nTwo different models of pulverizing equipment are being developed.\nIn the first the molten stream in an argon atmosphere is impinged upon\nI\n\n)y\n\na high energy water jet and in the second by a high power siren\n\noperating at 40 kc/se c.\nFor simplicity, the first runs will be performed on low\nmelting temperature metals. The difficulty in pulverizing metals\nalways lies in their extremely high surface tension so that one metal\nis much like the next one, as far as the means needed for pulverizing.\nOn tta other hand in the melting of a high temperature\nmetal, such as AuCu, enough heat is radiated to require very careful\nshielding of motors, oscillators, and the like so they will not\noverheat and become inoperative. However, this second problem does .ot\nappear to be insoluble, once the means of pulverizations are decided upon.\n\npage 9\n4\n\n1.\t\n\nMax Quatinetz, Robert J. Schaefer, and Charles R.
