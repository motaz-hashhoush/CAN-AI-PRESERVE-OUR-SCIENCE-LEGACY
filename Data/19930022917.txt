The\nmonitoring function has been implemented\nwith a neural\nnetwork doing the real-time task segmentation.\nThe interactive path planner\nhas been implemented\nfor redundant manipulators\nto specify arm configurations\nacross\nthe desired path and _atisfy geometric,\ntask and performance constraints.\n\nI\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAdvanced\nteleoperation\nsystems\nare characterized\nby\ncomputerized\nfeatures\naimed at reducing\nthe operator\'s\neffort and enhancing\nhis concentration\nduring\ntasks.\nTypical\nfeatures\nare force reflecting\ncontrol\njoysticks,\nmixing of video images with computer\ngraphics and advanced control modes such as sensor or model-referenced\ncontrol.\nThese features\nachieve\nbetween operator\nand task that\nof the remote task status.\n\nof Technology\n\nCalifornia\n\nAbstract\nTeleoperation\nexperiments\nat JPL have\nshown that advanced features in a telerobotic\nsystem are\na necessary condition for good results, but that they are\nnot sufficient to assure consistent\ngood performance\nby\nthe operators.\nTwo or three operators are normally used\nduring training and experiments\nto maintain the desired\nperformance.\nAn alternative\nto this multi-operator\ncontrol station is a man-machine\ninterface embedding\ncomputer programs\nfunctions.\n\na level of transparency\nassures good awareness\n\n87\n\nLee\n\nLaboratory\n\nInstitute\n\nPasadena,\n\nSukhan\n\n91109\n\nThe\n\nteleoperation\n\nexperiments\n\ncarried\n\nout\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nAdvanced\nTeleoperation\n(ATOP)\nlaboratory\nof the Jet\nPropulsion\nLaboratory\n(JPL) have shown that these features are necessary\nfor good results, but not sufficient\nfor consistent\nperformance.\nThe control of the many\ncomplex features of advanced\nteleoperators\noften results\nin excessive\nmental\nload and fatigue even during simple realistic experiments.\nTo avoid this potential\nproblem, two, often three, operators\nare used to manage the\nATOP\nsystem during training and experiments.\nA primary operator is in charge of the manipulation\nand the\nothers carry out support\nfunctions\nor serve as trainers.\nThe multioperator\napproach\nis convenient\nwhen there are\nno constraints\non the manpower\navailable\nat the control\nstation,\nbut, when its volume\nis constrained,\nthe manmachine interface\nshould be controllable\nby a single person without compromising\nperformance\nand task completion time. Thus the need for automatize\nsome of these\nfunctions.\nMost of the activities\nof the supporting\noperators are\nquite simple and yet very time consuming\nand could,\nin principle,\nbe replaced by computer\nprograms\nembedded in the man-machine\ninterface.\nSome of these operations\ninclude setting\nthe manipulator\ncontrol gains,\nmoving cameras\nand lights and operating\nthe data acquisition\nfunctions.\nAll the values in these functions\nare predetermined\nand the only free variable is the time\nat which those functions\nhave to be done.\nOther features that should be performed\nunder computer\nsupervision because of their computational\nrequirement,\nare task\nand path planning.\nA man-machine\ninterface embedding\nthese tools would cooperate\nwith the primary\noperator\nby providing\ndirect suggestions,\npresenting\ncommand\nalternatives\nand monitoring\nperformance\nfluctuations.\nTo test the feasibility\nof automatic\nwe have implemented\ntwo prototypes\n\ntools of this type,\nof an automatic\n\nFigure 1: The JPL Dual Arm Advanced Teleoperator\nmonitoring program and of a redundant manipulator\nplanner. The first tool is based on a neural-network for\nrecognition of task phases and real time task measure\nment and it will permit the flexible automation of some\ntask activities and the generation of feedback messages\nto the operator. In this way, a cooperative environment\ncan be set, in which the telerobot and the operator share\nduties and monitoring functions of a teleoperated task.\nThis approach would extend the paradigm of supervised\ncontrol to the case in which the telerobot monitors and\nsupervises the operator actions [4].\nThe second tool that we have also developed is an\ninteractive path planner for redundant robots that allows the operator to specify arm configurations across the\ndesired path satisfying geometric, task and performance\nconstraints. Redundant manipulators are designed to enhance dexterity and robustness in task execution because\nthey are equipped with more degrees of freedom (dof)\nthan the minimum required by the task space. These\nmanipulators allow the operator to carry out the primary manipulative task and, at the same time, to satisfy\nadditional constraints such as avoidance of singularities\nand joint limits, maximization of manipulability indices,\nsatisfaction of impedance characteristics, collision avoidance and fault tolerance. These constraints are satisfied\n\n88\n\nby using the redundant dof\xe2\x80\x99s of the manipulator, while\nmaintaining the position and orientation required by the\ntask. These motions of the manipulators are called self\ns\nmotions and the space in,which they are executed i the\nmanipulator null space.\n\nWhen redundant manipulators are used in teleoperation, there are additional technical issues that relate to\nthe operator\xe2\x80\x99s role in resolving the redundancy. Information must be provided to the operator to understand the\neffects of self motions in A meaningful and natural form.\n\nNext section gives a brief description of the elements\nof the ATOP system and of its operator interface. Our\ninitial results in developing a task model that can be\nused for interface/operator interaction are presented in\nsection 111. Section IV presents a brief summary of the\ncontrol problems of redundant manipulators, of the specific issues of redundant teleoperation and of our param\neterization approach [7].The conclusion summarizes the\npaper and presents our current research and development\ndirections.\n\nFigure 2: The JPL ATOP Operator Interface\n\nI1 THEADVANCED\nTELEOPERATION\nSYSTEM\nThe Advanced Teleoperation Laboratory (ATOP) is\nphysically divided into two parts: the remote site and\nthe local site. The main features of the remote site are:\n\n1. A Camera Positioning System consisting of a steel\nframe capable of supporting five movable TV c a m\neras. Currently, the frame supports three cameras\nmounted on pan/tilt platforms attached to computer controlled beams moving on the frame sides\nand ceiling. A monoscopic camera is mounted on\nthe ceiling and one on a side beam, while a stereo\ncamera is mounted on the other side beam.\n\n2 . A Dual Arm System consisting of two AAI 8 degreeof-freedom redundant manipulators, two Model C\nJPL Smart Hand and two sets of Universal M e\ntor Controllers (UMC) systems (fig. 1). The UMC\nelectronics performs the joint servo, the inverse and\ndirect kinematics of the redundant manipulators,\nand handles the communication with the smart\nhands and with the local site via fiber optic serial lines. Several advanced control features are\navailable in the dual arm system, such as contour\n\n89\n\nfollowing, shared compliance and harmonic motion\ngenerator [l], [8].\n\n3. Controlled Light Sources to create viewing conditions similar to those found in a space environment.\nThe local site of the ATOP system consists of the\ncontrol room with the operator interface (fig. 2). This\ninterface has evolved following the development and the\nintegration of new technologies into the teleoperation s y 5\ntem and is organized in three main subsystem:\n\n1. A Data Interface consisting of:\n(a) Parameter acquisition interface to enter robot\nconfiguration and control parameters.\n(b) Data acquisition interface to handle the communication with the smart hand and process\nincoming force and torque data.\n(c) Progmmming, debugging and set up interface\nfor the development, monitoring and setup of\nthe control programs for the manipulators.\n(d) Sensors interface to visualize in real time force\nand torque data collected by the manipulators\nsensors.\n\n2.

A Manual\n(a)\n\nInterface\n\nconsisting\n\nequipped\ndelay com-\n\ninclude in the input layer a set of nodes connected\nto the\noutput\nunits, to create a context\nmemory.\nThese units\nrepresents\nthe task phase already executed\n- the previous\nstate.\nA set of fixed weight connections\nhave been established\namong the output\nand context layer units (see\nfigure 3).\n\nof:\n\nForce Reflecting\nHand Controllers\n(FRHC),\ndriven by a pair of UMC\'s\nto command\nthe\nmovements\nof the robots\nand to feed back\nF\n\nforce\n\ninformation\n\nEK/TIPUT\n\nLAYI_.\n\nto the operator.\n\n(b)\n\nCamera Gantry Controls, to move the beams\nholding the cameras to the desired viewing position.\n\n(c)\n\nCamera\nControls to adjust\npan,\nzoom and iris of the cameras.\n\n(d)\n\nFoot Pedals for the\nsite.\nIII\n\nAUTOMATIC\n\npower\n\ntools\n\ntilt,\n\nfocus,\n\nin the\n\nremote\n\nSUPERVISION\n\nAn efficient\nsingle-person\nteleoperation\ninterface\nmust\nperform\nsome of the functions\nassigned\nto the operators of a multi-operator\ninterface.\nTo experiment\nwith\nthis idea, two different functions\nare under study:\nthe\nfirst one is the automatic\ndisplay of camera and control\nmenus during a task, and the second is the generation\nof\nfeedback\nmessages\nto the operator.\nIn the first case, the\ninterface\nmust automatically\nshow the operator\nthe appropriate\ncommand\nIn the second case,\n\nmenus for the specific task\'s phase.\nthe interface\nmust provide the oper-\n\nator with performance\nfeedback\nmessages\nderived from a\nstored model of the task execution.\nIn both cases, a key\nelement of these advanced tools is a program that can follow the development\nof a teleoperated\ntask by segmenting\nthe sensory data stream into appropriate\nphases.\nA task segmentation\nprogram\nof this type has been\nimplemented\nby means of a Neural Network architecture\n[2] and it is able to identify the segments\nof a peg-in-hole\ntask.\nWith this architecture,\nthe temporal\nsequence\nof\nsensory data generated\nby the wrist sensor on the manipulators\nare turned into spatial patterns\nand a window\nof sensor observations\nis associated\nto the current\ntask\nphase.\nThis problem\nis referred in the literature\nas that of\nlearning time sequences and has been approached\nprimarily with two architectures:\nTime-Delay\nand Partially\nRecurrent networks\n[5]. Partially\nRecurrent\nNetworks better represent\n\nthe temporal\n\nevolution\n\nof the task since they\n\n90\n\nFigure\n\nand\n\n3: Partially\n\nRecurrent\n\nNeural\n\nNetwork\n\nTraining\nis carried out to associate\nthe previous state\nthe window of sensor signals to the current\nstate:\n\n- At),..,\n\n- at), x(t - (! - 1)zxt),.,x(t)\n.\n..,\n\nwhere (0"1 (t),...,\nO\'n(t)) is the state corresponding\nto the\nx-force sensor signal x(t).\nThe window length\n(1 value)\nis a critical design factor.\nThe Partially\nRecurrent\nnetwork\ngave good results\nboth in training\nand in simulation\nand it has been interfaced to the ATOP telemanipulator\nsystem for real-time\ntests. The ATOP configuration\nis significantly\ndifferent\nfrom the one used for the training\ndata and therefore\nthese tests also verified the robustness\nof the approach\nto hardware\nvariations.\nFigure 4 shows as a dotted\nline the output of the realtime segmentation\nperformed\nby the network\nduring an\nactual peg-in-hole\ntask. The solid line represents\nthe correspondence\nbetween\ntask\'s phases and data.\nThe time\nresponse\nof the network is evident in the lag between homologous\ntransitions\nbetween\nthe solid and the dotted\nlines and it depends\nprimarily\non the computer\nused to\n\nbian inversion is performed near singularities and the lack\nof global optimization of the arm configurations.\nTo eliminate these problems, a parameterization\napproach has been proposed for the control of redundant\nmanipulators [7]. The redundant joints are considered as\nparameters of a non-redundant\nmanipulator for which we\ncan obtain a closed form solution of the inverse kinemat-\n\n2O\n16\n12\n$\n4\n0\n-4\n-8\n-12\n-le\n\ni\n\nl\n\nii\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nii\n\nIII\n\nI\n\n**lllllll*lll\n\nIllllllll[\n\n.2o\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\ne\n\nII\n\nt0\n\n12\n\n14\n\nFigure 4: Segmentation\n\nle\n\n18 20\n\nTint\n\n(_C)\n\n99\n\n24\n\n2e\n\nN\n\n_lO _1_ 14\n\nM\n\nin the real-time experiment\n\ncollect data and perform the network calculations. Several experiments\nhave been carried out and the results\nhave been quite encouraging with a percentage of correct segmentations\napproximately\nequal to 65%. Figure\n4 refers to the a typical Peg-in-Hole phases\' sequence [3].\nApproximately\nat time 29 sec the network miselassifies\nthe end of the extract phase (index n. 8) that should have\noccurred at time 34 sec. The network showed also unexpected capabilities to recover after misclassification and\nit was also able to follow tasks whose phases\' sequence\nvaried from the training one. During peg extraction, for\nexample, if the operator decided to regrasp the peg, the\nnetwork was sometimes able to make the transition from\nextraction to insertion and again to extraction. These\ntests were quite encouraging and this type of architecture can provide a building block for the automatic tools\nof an advanced teleoperation interface.\n\nIV\n\nCOOPERATIVE\n\nREDUNDANCY\n\nMANAGEMENT\nFor redundant manipulators\nit is not possible to formulate a closed form solution of the inverse kinematic problem and many control algorithms use a mixture of velocity based control and optimization procedures.\nThe\ninverse J acobian is used to compute the velocity transformations and a local optimization of some evaluation\ncriteria is used to determine the values of the redundant\njoints in the arm null space [9], [6]. The above velocitybased kinematic control has several drawbacks, including\ncomputational\ncost, numerical instability when the Jaco-\n\n91\n\nics. This approach transforms the problem of controlling\na redundant arm into that of selecting optimal values for\nthe configuration parameters, i.e. the redundant joints,\nalong the required trajectory.\nThis method has computational\nand numerical advantages over velocity-based\nkinematic controls and it\nprovides the necessary support for implementing cooperative redundancy management in teleoperation. In fact,\nthe operator can be shown a display of the parameter\nspace in which a surface representing a performance criterion is visualized. Every point on the surface is associated with values of the redundant joints and the operator\ncan immediately determine the best configuration.\nThe\nvalues of the redundant joints are the parameters that are\nused to compute the inverse kinematics of the associated\nnon redundant manipulator.\nMore specifically, a null space manifold is formed in\nthe parameter space with the consideration\nof individual\njoint limits, and characterized\nby an artificial potential\nfield representing the performance\nassociated with the\nindividual null space joint configurations.\nA null space\nmanifold can be easily formed by varying the parameter\nvalues within their limits, and by checking the availability\nof a solution through the position-based\nkinematic solution. The manifold can be incrementally\nupdated and\nanimated along the given task trajectories. The artificial\npotential function is then formed over the null space manifold based on a combination of several desired attributes\nsuch as proximity to joint limits, proximity to singularities, and measures of kinematic and dynamic manipula,\nbility. The potential function represents the performance\ncriterion for the selection of the joint configuration.\nIt\ncan be used either automatically\nby the system, following a local gradient search, or manually by the operator.\nIn this case, globally optimal joint configurations may be\nselected by extrapolating\nthe variations of performance\nassociated with the selected parameter values, or by analyzing the variation of the potential function at successive task points along the given task trajectory. In short,\nthe parameterization\nmethod allows the visualization of\nmanipulator internal performance through the display of\npotential functions in the parameter space. This provides\na medium for an interactive and cooperative interface for\nredundant telemanipulator planning, through which the\n\noperator can decide whether, when and how to reconfigure the arm for optimal task execution.\n\nachieves a high dexterity\nand singularity\navoidance.\nThe proposed\nparameterization\nmethod\nhas been suecessfully applied to the derivation\nof the closed form, parameterized\ninverse kinematic\nsolution\nof AAI manipulators. The derivation\nwas simplified\nby taking advantage\nof this arm decomposability:\nthe inverse position\ntransformation\nuses two joints as parameters,\none in the lower\narm (first 4 joints)\nand the other in the upper arm (last\n4 joints).\nA potential\nfunction\nover the solution manifold\nis then mapped onto the parameter\nspace for a given task\npoint, as illustrated\nin fig. 5.\nIn our current\nimplementation,\nsented with a 3-D graphic\ndisplay\n\nthe operator\nis preof the criterion\nfunc-\n\ntions plotted\nover the null space of the robot\ndifferent\nend effector positions\nand orientations.\n\nfor five\nCorre-\n\nsponding to each end effector position\nand orientation,\na\nsurface is plotted showing the value of the criterion\nfunction over the two dimensional\nnull space.\nThe operator\ncan specify the weights for each criterion function\nfor the\ndifferent\nsurfaces.\nThe display seen by the operator\nis\nshown on Fig. 5.\nThe input to the program is with a graphic\ninterface\nand it consists values of the redundant\njoints with which\nto start or to tune the computation\nof the optimal\ntrajectory.\nThis approach\nto redundant\npath planner\noffers\na number of advantages\nto the operator\nfor constructing\nfeasible\npaths during a task. In particular,\nthe operator\nhas complete\ncontrol in selecting\nthe robot configuration\nand the process is carried out in real-time\nsince the tool\nprovides immediate\nvisual feedback\non the quality of the\nselected\nparameters.\nFigure\nThe\n\n5: Criterion\nAAI arms\n\nfunctions\n\non the 2-D null space\n\nused in the ATOP\n\nlaboratory\n\nV\n\nare de-\n\ncomposable\narms and particularly\nsuited for the proposed\nparameterization\nmethod that can be applied to each one\nof the two subarms\nin which the manipulators\ncan be\npartitioned.\nIn this case, the parameterization\nmethod\nis very simple because a closed form of the parameterized\ninverse kinematic\nsolution can be readily obtained\nfrom\neach subarm\nand the null space manifold\nin the parameter space can be easily described.\nThe AAI arm is an 8 dof manipulator,\nwhere the 4\nlower revolute joints are configured\nas a cascaded\nspherical arm for positioning\nand the 4 upper revolute joints are\nconfigured\nas a Z-X-Y-Z wrist for orientation.\nThe AAI\narm has no link offsets and since the 4 wrist axes intersect\nat one point, the arm is decomposable.\nThis manipulator permits an easy kinematic\ncontrol because of its zero\noffsets and orthogonal\nmechanical\nstructure\nand it also\n\n92\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have described\nour current\nefforts to\nimprove\nthe communication\nbetween\nthe operator\nof a\ntelerobotic\nsystem and the system itself.
