b'Proposal for the IAC Business Cluster\n62nd IAC Cape Town, South Africa\nCrowdsourcing for Challenging Technical Problems \xe2\x80\x93 It Works!\nProposal: The NASA Johnson Space Center Space Life Sciences Directorate (SLSD)\nand Wyle Integrated Science and Engineering (Wyle) will conduct a one-day business\ncluster at the 62nd IAC so that IAC attendees will understand the benefits of open\ninnovation (crowdsourcing), review successful results of conducting technical challenges\nin various open innovation projects, and learn how an organization can effectively deploy\nthese new problem solving tools to innovate more efficiently and effectively.. Results\nfrom both the SLSD open innovation pilot program and the open innovation workshop\nconducted by the NASA Human Health and Performance Center will be discussed.\nNHHPC members will be recruited to participate in the business cluster (see membership\nhttp://nhhpc.nasa.gov ) and as IAF members.\nBackground: Crowdsourcing may be defined as the act of outsourcing tasks that are\ntraditionally performed by an employee or contractor to an undefined, generally large\ngroup of people or community (a crowd) in the form of an open call. The open call may\nbe issued by the organization wishing to find a solution to a particular problem or\ncomplete a task, or by an open innovation service provider on behalf of that organization.\nIn 2008, the SLSD, with the support of Wyle, established and implemented pilot projects\nin open innovation (crowdsourcing) to determine if these new internet-based platforms\ncould indeed find solutions to difficult technical challenges. These unsolved technical\nproblems were converted to problem statements, called \xe2\x80\x9cChallenges\xe2\x80\x9d by some open\ninnovation service providers, and were then posted externally to seek solutions to these\nproblems. In addition, an open call was issued internally to NASA employees Agency\nwide (11 Field Centers and NASA HQ) using an open innovation service provider\ncrowdsourcing platform to post NASA challenges from each Center for the others to\npropose solutions).\nResults: From 2008 to 2010, the SLSD issued 34 challenges, 14 externally and 20\ninternally. The 14 external problems or challenges were posted through three different\nvendors: InnoCentive, yet2.com and TopCoder. The 20 internal challenges were\nconducted using the InnoCentive crowdsourcing platform designed for use internal to an\norganization and customized for NASA use, and promoted as NASA@Work.\nThe results were significant. Of the seven InnoCentive external challenges, two full and\nfive partial awards were made in complex technical areas such as predicting solar flares\nand long-duration food packaging.\n\nInnoCentive Pilot:\nChallenge Data and Statistics\nChallenge Title\nImproved Barrier Layers \xe2\x80\xa6\nKeeping Food Fresh in Space\nMechanism for a Compact\nAerobic Resistive Exercise\nDevice\nData-Driven Forecasting of\nSolar Events\nCoordination of Sensor\nSwarms for Extraterrestrial\nResearch\nMedical Consumables\nTracking\nAugmenting the Exercise\nExperience\nSimple Microgravity Laundry\nSystem\n\nDeadline\n\nProj\nRms\n\nSub\n\nAward\nDate\n\nAward\nAmount\n\nJSC 12/18/2009 2/28/2010\nSLSD\n\n174\n\n22\n\n5/7/2010\n\n$11,000\n\nJSC 12/18/2009 2/28/2010\nSLSD\n\n564\n\n95\n\n5/14/2010\n\n$20,000\n\nJSC 12/22/2009 3/22/2010\nSLSD\n\n579\n\n11\n\n5/13/2010\n\n$30,000\n\nLRC\n\n2/27/2010 4/26/2010\n\n423\n\n37\n\n6/4/2010 $18,000 (3)\n\nGRC\n\n5/17/2010 7/27/2010\n\n365\n\n56\n\nin progress $15,000 (3)\n\nJSC SLSD\n\n5/27/2010 7/27/2010\n\n229\n\n18\n\n9/20/2010\n\n$10,000\n\nJSC EA\n\n5/27/2010 7/27/2010\n\n598\n\n108\n\n9/21/2010\n\n$7,500\n\nCtr\n\nPosted\n\nSpace Life Sciences\nExploring Space | Enhancing Life\n\n22\n\nSimilarly, the TopCoder challenge yielded and improved optimization algorithm for\noptimizing a lunar medical kit, and the yet2.com challenges yielded many new industry\nand academic contacts in bone imaging, microbial detection and even the use of\npharmaceuticals for radiation protection.\nThe internal challenges through NASA@Work drew over 6000 participants with\nsignificant participation across all NASA centers. An example for three challenges\nconducted by the Ames Research Center demonstrates the rapid and efficient\nparticipation from employees at multiple centers to contribute to problem solving:\n\nARC Challenges\n16\nSSC\n14\n\nMSFC\nLARC\n\n12\n\nKSC\n\n10\n\nJSC/WSTF\n\n8\n\nJPL\n\n6\n\nHQ\nGSFC/WFF\n\n4\n\nGRC\n\n2\n\nDFRC\nARC\n\n0\n394-Creating\n\xe2\x80\x9cInternSpace"\n\n395-Robotic Sensor\nPlatform\n\n430-Measuring Gas\nin Microliter Samples\n\nFinally, on January 19, 2011, the SLSD will conduct a conference on open collaboration\nand innovation best practices and implementation through its newly established (October\n18, 2010) NASA Human Health and Performance Center (NHHPC), with five speakers\nand participating members contributing to an exceptional panel facilitated by the GSA\nand aimed at crowdsourcing and running effective challenges (Harvard Business School,\nMozilla, General Mills, Proctor & Gamble, NASA, InnoCentive, and Yet2.com). The\nfindings from this workshop, including the ability of the NHHPC to enable publicprivate partnerships, will be available for the business cluster. One of the findings [will\nbe] for a traditional aerospace organization (NASA) to effectively form partnerships with\nnon-traditional partners. Others will be communicated following the workshop. At\npresent, the NHHPC membership includes ESA (pending approval),JAXA, DLR, FAA\nAST, FAA CAMI, Wyle and many more (see\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/offices/NHHPC/members/index.html ) NASA will recruit NHHPC\nmembers to support the business cluster and as IAF members as well.\n\n'
