\xe2\x80\x93 Introduction and Background\nAir travel had a profoundly positive impact on the world in the 20th century. Airliners provide\nefficient, fast, and safe transport unmatched by any other mode of long distance travel.\nFurthermore, air travel has rapidly expanded to connect all corners of the earth due to its flexible\ncapacity and routing, low infrastructure cost and freedom from geographic barriers. However,\nseveral factors are now combining to threaten air transportation over the coming decades.\n\n2010\n\n2005\n\n2000\n\n1995\n\n1990\n\n1985\n\n1980\n\n1975\n\nUSD\xc2\xa0/\xc2\xa0Gallon\n\n$4.00\nIncreased demand for fuel and diminishing\nwww.bts.gov\xc2\xa0(1977\xe2\x80\x901999)\nsupply is resulting in increasing and volatile\n$3.50\nwww.bts.gov\xc2\xa0(1986\xe2\x80\x902007)\nfuel prices. As illustrated in Figure 1.1, the\nwww.bts.gov\xc2\xa0(2000\xe2\x80\x902010)\n$3.00\ninflation-corrected jet fuel price started\n$2.50\nclimbing rapidly in 2000 and increased nearly\n$2.00\nfour-fold compared to prices of previous\ndecades. Growth of the world\xe2\x80\x99s economy is\n$1.50\nstraining natural resources, increasing the cost\n$1.00\nof fuel while simultaneously growing travel\n$0.50\ndemand. Global consumption of carbon-based\nenergy for all purposes is changing the\nenvironment in worrisome and unpredictable\nways3. While commercial aviation\xe2\x80\x99s share of Figure 1.1 \xe2\x80\x93 The Rise and Volatility of Fuel Prices is\nSeriously Impacting Aviation1,2\nglobal CO2 production is only about 2%4, it is\na conspicuous contributor, subject to\nregulation or taxation that may reduce its ability to sustain growth into the future.\n\nAnticipated air travel growth may also become restricted due to airport capacities and mounting\nresistance to airport noise and air pollution. These factors present an important opportunity for\nthe aerospace community to apply exciting new technologies and design tools for the benefit of\nthe United States and the world in the 21st century.\nThe most challenging factors point toward the need for reduced energy consumption by airliners\nthus mitigating both the impact of high fuel prices and environmental effects. Exploration of\nalternative fuels and forms of energy along with more energy efficient aircraft will reduce the\nvolume of fossil fuel required. These more efficient airplanes tend to be less noisy and combined\nwith additional active and passive acoustic suppression measures can address NASA goals\n(Table 1.1).\nThe ambitious goals of the study\nforce reconsideration of every\naspect of airplane efficiency.\nChanges in operations can\nprovide significant improvements in energy consumption.\nFor example, some airlines have\nrecently reduced cruise speeds to\nand\nincrease\nefficiency5\nimproved flight paths are\nincreasingly applied as a means\n\nTable 1.1 \xe2\x80\x93 NASA\'s Technology Goals for Future Subsonic Vehicles6\nCORNERS OF THE\nTRADE SPACE\n\nN+1 (2015 EIS)\nGeneration\nConventional\nTube and Wing\n(relative to B737/CFM56)\n\nN+2 (2020 IOC)\nGeneration\nUnconventional\nHybrid Wing Body\n(relative to B777/GE90)\n\nN+3 (2030-2035 EIS)\nAdvanced Aircraft Concepts\n(relative to user defined\nreference)\n\nNoise\n(cum. below Stage 4)\n\n-32 dB\n\n-42 dB\n\n55 LDN at average airport\nboundary\n\nLTO NOx Emissions\n(below CAEP 6)\n\n-60%\n\n-75%\n\nbetter than -75%\n\nPerformance:\nAircraft Fuel Burn\n\n-33%\n\n-40%\n\nbetter than -70%\n\nPerformance:\nField Length\n\n-33%\n\n-50%\n\nexploit metro-plex concepts\n\n1\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nto wring the greatest possible efficiency from existing airplanes. While valuable, these changes\nalone cannot provide improvements that meet the goals of this study. A change to improve one\nfactor of fuel efficiency can diminish another. However, new technologies promise to improve\nindividual factors of airplane energy consumption with reduced adverse effects. For example,\nadvances in material and structural technology may mitigate the increase in structural weight that\nusually results from using higher span to increase L/D. The broad time frame of the study\nencourages exploration and extrapolations of current technology trends as well as the invention\nof new technologies. These must be physically realistic and reasonable in the study time frame.\n\n1.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Defining \xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe definition of \xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x9d technology is important as it serves as the reference for meeting the four\nNASA goals. At the beginning of the contract, communication with NASA verified that for the\npurpose of this study, 737NG vehicle and CFM56 engine technology are the in-service standards\nand thus the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x9d. It should be noted that the 737 will not be used directly for\ncomparison to any advanced concepts developed. The \xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x9d Baseline configuration will be\ndeveloped using the same rules, tools, and levels of fidelity as the advanced concepts but with\ntechnology levels consistent with a 737NG.\n\n1.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Vehicle Class Definitions\nThe Boeing Company recognizes Regional Jets (RJ\xe2\x80\x99s), Single Aisles, Twin Aisles, Very Large\nJets (VLJ\xe2\x80\x99s), and Freighters as five classes of commercially operated airliners. For the SUGAR\ncontract (with exception to the future scenario), these classifications will be simplified into\nRegional, Medium, and Large classes. The simplification also serves the purpose of separating\nthe vehicle classes from the species discriminating names Twin Aisle and Single Aisle.\nPassenger airplanes dominate the commercial market and tend to push airplane technology\nforward. Freighters are historically fallouts from passenger driven designs and are thus excluded\nfrom the SUGAR study. These class definition changes are illustrated in Figure 1.2.\n\nBoeing Classification\n\xe2\x80\x93 Regional\n\xe2\x80\x93 Single Aisle\n\xef\x82\xa7 737\n\xef\x82\xa7 757\n\xef\x82\xa7 A320\n\nSUGAR \xe2\x80\x9cN+3\xe2\x80\x9d Contract\nClassification\n\xe2\x80\x93 Regional\n\xe2\x80\x93 Medium\n\xe2\x80\x93 Large\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Twin Aisle\n\xef\x82\xa7 767\n\xef\x82\xa7 777\n\xef\x82\xa7 A340\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Very Large Jets\n\nAll vehicles sized for this\ncontract are considered\nfamily center points\n\n\xef\x82\xa7 747\n\xef\x82\xa7 A380\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Freighters\nFigure 1.2 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR Vehicle Class Definitions\n\n2\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n2.0 \xe2\x80\x93 Future Scenario\nA 20 year forecast of the commercial airline current market outlook (CMO)7 has been published\nfor 40 years and shared with airlines, journalists, bankers, investment analysis, governments,\nsuppliers and educators. The forecast includes all commercial aircraft 30 seats and over in all\nregions of the world. It is the only complete forecast that combines a top down and bottom up\nanalysis.\nHistorically the CMO has a good record of predicting aggregate air travel demand, however at\ndisaggregated levels it has somewhat under predicted the demand for the future number of new\nairplanes in various size categories. This under-prediction is comprised primarily of an underforecasting of demand for the single-aisle market and the ability of twin-aisle airplanes to open\nup new long-range city pairs with a higher number of frequencies. In addition, the distortion of\nmarket forces with the introduction of Regional Jets and associated scope clause also impacted\ndemand in these size categories. Much of the misestimated demand for large airplanes (e.g.747,\nA380) was predicated on historical behavior and regulatory r\xc3\xa9gimes in force at the time. These\nimpacts have been reduced as these phenomena have been incorporated into the knowledge base\nand tools underpinning the CMO.\nThe CMO tools, described in Section 2.1, were exercised for the SUGAR contract and provide\nspecific forecasts for the 2030 and 2055 timeframes which are discussed in Section 2.2.\n\n2.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Forecasting Tools\nPrior to understanding how Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s market forecasting tools work, one must understand the\nunderlying dynamics of the airline industry. The airline operating environment is challenging\nand is driven by pressures that are hard to predict including volatile oil prices, a varying world\neconomy, shifting regulatory policies, geopolitical events, slowing traffic growth, congestion,\nand environmental pressures.\nTypically, world airline revenue is approximately one percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nThis relationship varies by country and is shown in Figure 2.1. While airline revenues remain a\nconstant percentage of GDP, travel demand grows over time.\n1.80%\n1.60%\n1.40%\n1.20%\n\nAfrica\nAsia-Pacific\n\n1.00%\n\nEurope\nLatin America\n\n0.80%\n\nMiddle East\n\n0.60%\n\nNorth America\nWorld\n\n0.40%\n0.20%\n0.00%\n1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n\nFigure 2.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Airline Revenue as Percentage of GDP\n\n3\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nTrade, measured as imports and exports, typically grows one and a half to two times faster than\nGDP. The ratio of GDP to Available Seat Miles (ASM), or travel share, grows with increased\ntrade. A steady positive trend of travel share with time is illustrated in Figure 2.2.\n180\n\nTravel Share of GDP (GDP/ASK index\n\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2020\n\n2025\n\nFigure 2.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Time Trend Travel Share of GDP\n\nThese relationships are used in conjunction with a world model that predicts the GDP growth of\ntwelve economic regions (Figure 2.3). These regions were formed to best represent major world\ntraffic flows and do not always match political or geographic regions. This defines 64 traffic\nflows both internal to the region and between regions. Recognition of the impact of liberalization\nof air services on airline competition and the subsequent stimulation of traffic as the value of air\ntravel increases are also modeled and incorporated into the demand model.\n\nC.I.S.\nNorth\nAmerica\n\nEurope\n\nCentral\nAmerica\nSouth\nAmerica\n\nMid\nEast\nAfrica\n\nSouth\nWest\nAsia\n\nChina\n\nNorth\nEast\nAsia\n\nSouth East\nAsia\nOceania\n\nFigure 2.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Traffic forecasted within and between 12 world regions\n\n4\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nThe GDP forecasted demand is met by forecast airline operators. 149 individual airlines\n(including cargo, charter, regional, low cost carriers (LCC), and subsidiary carriers) are modeled\nbased on their existing fleet, operational models, and financial situation. Predictions estimate\nhow airlines react to forecast demand. Factors that would affect airline decisions are illustrated in\nFigure 2.4 and primarily depend on the duration of the forecasted demand and the financial\nimpact on the airline. The airline models also try to predict what additional new markets would\nbe served by each airline.\nDemand modeling also includes effects of transportation mode shifts, infrastructure, air traffic\nmanagement (ATM), and operations. Transportation mode shifts (e.g. air-rail in Europe, rail-air\nin India) both positive and negative to air travel in the short-haul markets are estimated and\nincorporated. Infrastructure in general is assumed to lag demand, there is a build-up of pressure\nto improve the infrastructure before it is improved. NextGen ATM is included in the model, but\nis assumed to not be as efficient as planned. Metroplex operations are not explicitly in the\nforecast but they are also not excluded from being a solution to pent-up demand from\ninfrastructure lag. Environmental concerns are modeled as a broadening cap and trade\narrangement lead by Europe, followed by USA and Asian countries. This equates to an\nincreasing cost of flying and, by holding %GDP constant, leads to less demand for travel than\nwould be otherwise expected.\nGlobal economic growth drives air\ntravel and in turn airline fleet growth\n\nFleet Growth\n\nAirline Decisions\nFleet Requirements\n\nNew Airplanes\n\nLong term\n\nUsed Airplanes\nParked Airplanes\n\nTraffic growth\n\nDelayed\nRetirement\n\nShort term\n\nUtilization\n\nEconomic growth +\nLiberalization\n\nHigh\n\nLow\nCapital intensity\n\nFigure 2.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Underlying Dynamics of the Airline Industry\n\nThe CMO is driven by economics. Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s product forecasters create a bottom-up scenario at\nthe airline level by adding services (frequency, city pairs, and capacity) to balance the top-down\ntraffic forecast (driven by GDP) on a regional flow basis (Figure 2.5).\nThe product forecast used for the process is derived by examining data about the current and\nprojected fleet. Figure 2.6, an example of this data, shows the number of tickets sold in a day for\nevery origin-destination pair (international and domestic). Highlighted areas have low traffic\ndensity and thus limited product availability. These are created by geography, (few fly to the\nmiddle of an ocean), and probability, (the odds of needing to fly to exactly the opposite side of\n5\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nthe world).

Short term economic fluctuations are not expected to significantly change the long\nterm growth trends.\n\nFigure 2.7 \xe2\x80\x93 2010 to 2030 Forecast: Strong Long Term Growth\n\nOver the past 20 years, air travel grew by an average of 4.8 percent each year, despite two major\nworld recessions, terrorist acts, the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, and two Gulf wars. During 40 years of producing the CMO,\nBoeing has learned that the resilience of air transport growth comes from its intrinsic importance\nto the livelihood of people around the world.\nOn average over the next 20 years, passenger travel will grow at 5.0 percent and cargo at 5.8\npercent. The fastest growing economies will lead the transformation into a more geographically\nbalanced market. The average growth in airline passenger numbers will be around 4.0 percent\neach year. More people will be traveling by air as economies grow. Markets will open up\nthrough reduced regulation and increased competition. As these markets expand, new travel\nopportunities will mostly be on longer-distance flights.\nThe air transport fleet plays a fundamental role in stimulating and sustaining economic activity.\nThis tie-in is clear, with the 3.2 percent annual fleet growth in line with expected long-term\neconomic growth of 3.2 percent.\nTotal fleet size as well as the rate of aircraft replacement have been estimated and are shown in\nFigure 2.8. This shows a large demand for replacing older, less efficient aircraft.\nWith the projected passenger and cargo growth, the total in-service fleet will nearly double by\n2030 growing from 18,000 airplanes to over 32,000. It will take 14,000 new airplanes to meet the\ngrowth requirements. In addition, it will take about 11,900 new airplanes to replace retiring\nairplanes. That\xe2\x80\x99s a total need of about 25,900 new airplanes over the next 20 years.\nApproximately 54 percent of the 25,900 new airplanes being delivered over the next 20 years are\nattributable to growth in the market. The remaining 46 percent of the demand for new aircraft is\ncoming from replacing older airplanes, up from 36 percent last year. This strong replacement\n7\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\ndemand is being driven by high fuel prices and the introduction of new, very efficient, very\ncapable aircraft. In a tough, competitive environment, airlines are looking for ways to cut costs\nfrom their operations. With high fuel prices, it certainly makes more and more sense for airlines\nto replace their old aircraft with new, fuel efficient airplanes, and we have reflected that trend in\nour analysis.\nApproximately 6,100 airplanes, about 34 percent of the fleet operating today, will still be in\noperation 20 years from now.\nUnits\n40,000\n\n32,000\n30,000\n\n14,000\nGrowth\n54%\n20,000\n\n25,900\n\n18,000\n\n10,000\n\n11,900\nReplacement\n46%\n\n6,100\nRetained Fleet\n0\n2008\n\n2030\n\nFigure 2.8 \xe2\x80\x93 Increasing Demand for Replacing Older, Less Efficient Aircraft\n\nThe projected fleet compositions for 2008, 2030, and 2055 are listed in Table 2.1. The table\nshows the rate of fleet retirement based on aircraft technology level and also helps illustrate the\ntime it takes for a new airplane to comprise a significant percentage of the market. A new\nmedium sized aircraft with an entry to service of 2030 will comprise about 50% of the fleet in 25\nyears. This trend is consistent with other sized aircraft though the actual percentage varies.\nThe CMO also predicts the required airplane size for the estimated entry to service. The size is\ndriven by many factors. Technology and the environment, depending on specifics, may pull\ntoward either larger or smaller vehicles. Seat mile economics and airport congestion generally\ndrive toward larger aircraft. Crew costs, direct markets, turn time, competition, and the overall\npassenger experience drive toward smaller aircraft.\nFigure 2.9 shows the weekly frequencies of airplanes with relation to their size. Future markets,\nfuel prices, infrastructure, and environmental issues are predicted to force an up-gauging in the\nsmall airplane market driving small and medium regional jets into large regional jets and small\nsingle-aisle categories. Single aisle and regional jets comprise 90% of airplane frequencies, a\ntrend which should continue into 2055.\nDetailed future fleet information is needed for aircraft sizing. The CMO was used to predict the\nnumber of aircraft in the fleet in 2030 as discussed in the previous paragraphs. It was also used to\ngenerate more specific data about each airplane class shown in Table 2.2. The data in the table is\na mixture of design goals and operational characteristics generated with the assumption that\nvehicles will fly the same speed they fly today and in the current air traffic management system.\n\n8\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nThe number of seats, average trip distance, and maximum trip distance are used as design\nparameters for the airplane.\nTable 2.1 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR Fleet Mix by Year and Aircraft Class\nSeries Class\n\nRegional\n\nMedium\n\nLarge\n\nGeneration\nN+3\nN\nN-1\nN-2\nN-3\nTotal\nN+3\nN+1&2\nN\nN-1\nN-2\nN-3\nTotal\nN+3\nN+1&2\nN\nN-1\nN-2\nTotal\n\n2008\n0\n0\n1,800\n1,350\n75\n3,225\n0\n0\n0\n6,050\n4,400\n950\n11,400\n0\n0\n0\n1,550\n1,800\n3,350\n18,000\n\nGrand Total\n\n2030\n0\n1,000\n1,575\n100\n0\n2,675\n0\n9,000\n1,500\n11,350\n300\n0\n22,150\n0\n1,000\n4,400\n1,700\n125\n7,225\n32,000\n\n2055\n2,000\n1,250\n150\n0\n0\n3,400\n20,000\n18,000\n1,000\n1,000\n0\n0\n40,000\n5,000\n3,350\n5,000\n250\n0\n13,600\n57,000\n\nRegional jets\n450\n\nSingle-aisle\n\nTwin-aisle\n\n747 & larger\n\n(below 90 seats)\n\n(90-240 seats)\n\n(180-400 seats)\n\n(over 400 seats)\n\n400\n\nWeekly Frequency (1,000)\n\n350\n300\n\n90% of all frequencies\n\n250\n\nNotional 2050\n200\n\n99% of all frequencies\n\n150\n\n2030\n100\n\n2010\n50\n0\nAirplane Size\n\nFigure 2.9 \xe2\x80\x93 Weekly Frequency vs. Airplane Size\n\nSince the air traffic management system is unconstrained for SUGAR the airplanes are allowed\nto fly slower than what is listed in the chart.

For SUGAR the assumption is that the fleet\ndaily air miles (fleet size times daily miles), or demand, remains fixed independent of speed.\nSlowing a vehicle class down will result in an increased fleet size inversely proportionate to the\nchange in speed. Since the total fleet daily air miles remains fixed, each airplane would fly less\ncycles in a day and thus burn less fuel for the day. On a fleet basis, the fuel burn benefit for\nslowing down is proportional to the individual airplane fuel burn benefit.\nTable 2.2 \xe2\x80\x93 CMO 2030 Aircraft Fleet Information\n\nNumber of Aircraft\nFamily Midpoint # of Seats\nAvg Distance\nMax Distance\nAvg Trips/day\nAvg MPH\nFleet Daily Air Miles (K)\nDaily Miles\nDaily Hours\n\nRegional\n2,675\n70\n575\n2,000\n6.00\n475\n8,500\n3,200\n6.92\n\nMedium\n22,150\n154\n900\n3,500\n5.00\n500\n100,000\n4,500\n9.23\n\nLarge\n7,225\n300\n3,300\n8,500\n2.00\n525\n55,000\n7,600\n13.96\n\nAircraft utilization, desired operational city pairs, and airline driven economics drive a minimum\nspeed for aircraft.

Since 1970 the air transportation system is about 70% more efficient,\nthis improvement has come from airspace management, airline operations, airplane design, and\nmaterial technology. The underlying assumption of progress aligns with this trend. Projecting\nforward to 2030-2035 yields ~35% improvement from the current system. It is important to\nremember that in 1970 the world was a much different place, and one would be hard pressed to\n10\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nimagine all of the advancements that have been delivered over that time. After the configurations\ndiscussed later in this report were analyzed, it was determined that, when combined with air\ntraffic control improvements, the assumptions in the Future Scenario are similar to the results\nachieved by the Refined SUGAR, SUGAR High, and SUGAR Ray. Therefore, the technologies\nand designs studied are in-line with the assumptions made at the beginning of this study, so the\nexisting Future Scenario is still valid for the SUGAR advanced concepts. Even though these\naircraft fly slower than what is suggested by Table 2.2, their gate to gate time is actually a little\nfaster due to improvements in direct routing and taxi times (Figure 6.3). The city pairs the\naircraft can serve are not greatly impacted because the cruise Mach number was held to Mach\n0.70. Overall, the data in the table remains valid.\nThe SUGAR Volt concept uses less fuel but assumes significant changes in airport infrastructure\nto handle the charging and transportation of modular batteries. A separate analysis of energy and\nbattery cost associated with this concept is recommended.\nRecent changes in the World economy, although significant, are still thought to be captured by\nthe long term trends assumed in the Future Scenario. The influence of oil price fluctuations on\nBoeing forecasts have also been studied, and tend to influence all forms of transportation,\nreducing the unique impact on aviation.\nThe baseline Future Scenario is driven by many factors, like technology investment, regulation\nof air travel, as well as basics like airport and airspace infrastructure. There is a basic assumption\nthat government and industry worldwide will continue to invest to allow air travel to compete\nwith other transportation modes and continue to act as a catalyst for trade and business\ndevelopment in the future. If this assumption were to be removed, then the Future Scenario\nwould change greatly.\nFor this alternate Future Scenario, the resulting travel demand can be evaluated and there is a 1015% decrease in travel that depends on the rate of technology investment in other modes, i.e.\nwould they slow down their investment because they have less competition. The decrease in\ntravel is equivalent of not needing ~10,000 airplanes during the 20 years after the change in\ntechnology assumption, or ~7,000,000 passengers per day. More speculatively, the effect on\ntrade and global economic development could slow GDP by 0.3%, but this effect has not been\naccounted for.\nIn this alternate Future Scenario, the cost of flying is up, while the level of service is down; this\nis a compounding effect that reduces travel demand further and squeezes profits across the\nindustry. The profit squeeze reduces investments and slows development compounding the issue.\nThe total effect of this is not captured in the forecast of the reduction in fleet need because it\nquickly spirals out of control until there is no more air travel; we know that something would\nchange and equilibrium would be restored.\nIn this alternate Future Scenario, seat mile economics and scarce infrastructure drive toward\nlarger aircraft, while direct markets, competition, and the overall passenger experience suffer.\nThis alternate Future Scenario is not considered likely, but is discussed here only to serve as an\nindication of the value of the technology work that is being conducted at NASA, Boeing, the\nengine companies, and universities.\n\n11\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n3.0 \xe2\x80\x93 Advanced Concept Selection\nThe Boeing Company solicited input from the Georgia Tech (Ga. Tech) Aerospace Systems\nDesign Laboratory (ASDL) to facilitate a workshop for concept selection for the SUGAR\naircraft. Working closely with Boeing and General Electric, ASDL formalized a custom process\nand created tools specifically created for the concept selection activity based on past experience\nin similar programs.\nThe overall goal of the workshop was to downselect a few operational, airframe and engine\nconcepts for further analysis and study. The workshop required coordination between the\npartners prior to the actual events of the workshop to create the interactive tools which would aid\nin workshop activities.\n\n3.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Process Overview and Background\nThe workshop for SUGAR concept selection was centered on using an Interactive\nReconfigurable Matrix of Alternatives (IRMA) as a tool to aid in the discovery of configurations.\nIRMA is a systematic qualitative procedure that is unique to the conceptual design process\ndeveloped by ASDL. It was created to provide an \xe2\x80\x9caudit-trail\xe2\x80\x9d to define reference systems upon\nwhich quantitative analysis could be performed in a traceable, structured and systematic manner.\nIRMA builds on the concept of a Morphological Analysis created by Fritz Zwicky. Zwicky states\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the final and true world image everything is related to everything, and nothing can\nbe discarded a priori as being unimportant.\xe2\x80\x9d8\nGiven the complexity of the new systems, there are millions of possible alternatives in the\nhyperspace of requirements, technologies and responses. Not all these alternatives can be\nquantitatively compared within the practical time limits imposed by the program management.\nTo overcome this issue, a qualitative brain-storming exercise has been developed by ASDL to\nprioritize and down-select the important requirements and alternatives with feedback from\ndisciplinary experts and program management. This allows the quantitative process of the downselected alternatives to be much more manageable.\nThe IRMA is a combination of Systems Engineering techniques such as Matrix of Alternatives,\nMulti-Attributes Decision Making (MADM) and Technique for Ordered Preference by Similarity\nto Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS)9. Figure 3.1 depicts the Interactive Reconfigurable Matrix of\nAlternatives (IRMA) which was created for the SUGAR workshop. These tools provide a\nprocess for functionally decomposing the problem, identifying alternatives and technologies to\nmeet the functions, and identifying the solutions that meet the top level needs. These tools and\nprocesses provide a mechanism for encouraging collaborative communication at the early stages\nof conceptual design.\nThe general procedure for selecting a system through the Morphological Matrix of Alternatives\nis as follows:\n-\n\nFunctionally decompose the existing system\n\n-\n\nFor each function, list all the possible ways in which it might be satisfied\n\n-\n\nExamine the matrix for the possible new permutations.\n\n12\n\nWing\nS&C\nPropulsor\nIntegration\n\nVehicle Characteristics\n\nFuselage\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nNumber of Fuselages\nWing-Body Blend\nNo. of Passenger Decks\nNumber\nLocation\nHigh Lift System\nBracing\nJoin\nFolding\nMorphing\nWinglet\nPitch Effecter\nYaw Effecter\nRoll Effecter\nLocation\nPropulsor Type\nPropulsor Arrangement\nEnergy Conversion\nAugmentation\nPrimary Fuel\n\nMetrics Selection\nAlternatives (First)\nFuel Burn and\nEnergy\nOrder of\nConsumed\nSelection\nAlternative #1\nScore Select\nAlternative #2\nScore Select Alternative #3\nScore Select\nAlternative #4\nScore Se\nNone\n0\nYes\n1\n2\nNone\nNone\nFairing\nModerate Blend\nExtreme Blend\nNone\n1\n1.5\n2\nHigh\n3\n1\n2\nMed\n9\nLow\nMid\nHigh\nPylon Mount\nLow\nConventional\nTriple Slotted Flap\nYes\nUSB\nEBF\nLow\nNone\nStrut\nCable\nTruss\nMed\n7\nNone\nTip\nMid\nBox\nMed\n8\nNone\nIn Flight\nOn Ground\nLow\nNone\nPlanform\nVariable Camber\nBoth\nHigh\n2\nNone\nConventional\nRaked\nFeathers\nHigh\nConv.

The IRMA process contains a dynamic dashboard for visualizing the effects of each\ndecision. When a selection is made, incompatible options are filtered out thereby facilitating\ndown-selection. The interactive nature of the IRMA tool allows for decision makers to\nunderstand the impact of decisions at the initial point of decision making. In a collaborative\ngroup such as seen at the SUGAR workshop, this tool provides a mechanism for understanding\nthe impacts of the order of decisions as well as facilitating discussions among group members.\n\n3.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Pre-Workshop Steps\nIn order to create an IRMA and have a successful workshop for selecting advanced vehicle\nconcepts, a fair amount of systems engineering activities must occur prior to the workshop.\nFigure 3.2 depicts the necessary general steps to creating the IRMA in preparation for the\nworkshop. This section will describe the details and major outcomes of each step.\nThese steps are carried through by a subset of workshop participants who have demonstrated\ntechnical competence in systems engineering techniques as well as the technical aspects for the\nproblem at hand. The subgroup for the development of the SUGAR IRMA consisted of\nrepresentatives from The Boeing Company as well as representatives from General Electric. The\nrepresentatives from General Electric provided input and guidance supporting engine\ntechnologies and integration issues.\n\n13\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nSet of Customer\nRequirements\n\nDefine\nProblem in\nterms of\nRequirements\n\nDecompose\nrequirements\nin terms of\nfunctional\ntaxonomy\n\nIdentify\nalternatives to\ndecomposition\nand compose\nmorphological\nmatrix\n\nCreate\nconditional\nrelationships of\nfunctional\ndecomposition\n\nIdentify and\ndiscuss\nattributes for\neach row of\ndecomposition\n\nRank order\ndecomposition\nbased on\nrelative\nimportance to\nrequirements\n\nSet optimal\nsuitable\nreference\nsystems\n\nIRMA\n\nFigure 3.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Pre-Workshop Activity Sequence\n\nPre-workshop Step 1: Identify a set of customer requirements\nPreparation for the workshop begins first with understanding the needs of the customer. Section\n1.0 and 2.0 discusses the current outlook for the commercial aircraft market and illustrates the\nneed for a more efficient, environmentally friendly fleet. In response to this, NASA has issued an\naggressive set of goals to drive next generation aircraft design. Table 1.1 shows the various goals\nNASA has set for future aircraft design. The SUGAR initiative strives to develop N+3 vehicle\nconcepts to meet the most aggressive set of goals: reduction of aircraft noise, NOx emissions,\ntakeoff field length, and fuel burn. These requirements, coupled with the current market outlook,\nprovide the initial constraints for the SUGAR initiative and direct IRMA construction.\nPre-workshop Step 2: Define problem in terms of requirements\nOnce the customer has issued a set of requirements, and the overall project goal has been\nestablished, the requirements must be translated such that the problem can later be mapped to\nrealizable engineering characteristics. Section 2.0 discusses how the aircraft fleet is changing and\nhow aircraft will be used in the future. This information, coupled with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s goals, helps\nformulate the overall problem: to design advanced concept, improved performance aircraft which\ncan fit the changing market while also meeting aggressive environmental standards. Therefore,\nthe problem can be understood as one primarily involving aircraft architecture; changes to the\naircraft architecture will either enhance or detract from the vehicle performance relative to one or\nmore of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s goals. In order to thoroughly address vehicle performance, the specific vehicle\nsystems that most affect performance should be identified and targeted as important areas for the\nconceptual design process. The Boeing team noted that design changes made to the aircraft\nfuselage, wing, stability and control system, and propulsion system would most impact the\n\n14\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nvehicle\xe2\x80\x99s performance. The problem then becomes one that involves conceptual design tradeoffs\nof the vehicle characteristics.\nPre-workshop Step 3: Decompose requirements in terms of functional taxonomy\nOnce the targeted areas of vehicle architecture have been defined, it is important to break down\nthe architecture in terms of its functional components. This is the first step in building the\nmorphological matrix essential to IRMA. Using the sub-categories defined by Boeing (i.e.\nfuselage, wing, stability and control, propulsion) as a starting place, the vehicle can be\nfunctionally broken down into its parts. These functional \xe2\x80\x9cparts\xe2\x80\x9d will serve as points of decision\nfor each concept created. Design decisions are then made at this level of detail, ensuring that the\nconcepts can be built from the \xe2\x80\x9cbottom up\xe2\x80\x9d with much freedom to generate the N+3 concepts\nthat will best address NASA\xe2\x80\x99s goals.\nIn order to begin vehicle decomposition, it is important to know the vehicle components which\nmake up each subsystem as these generate decision making points in the IRMA. For example, a\nfew of the design points that make up the wing subsystem are the number of wings, wing\nlocation, the type of high lift system, and the type of wing bracing.\n\nWing\nS&C\nPropulsor\nIntegration\n\nVehicle Characteristics\n\nFuselage\n\nThe functional decomposition was completed by Boeing and GE in keeping with the fuselage,\nwing, stability and control, and propulsion categories.

For example, an airplane may\nrealistically have 1 or 2 wings. Therefore these are the two alternatives which would populate the\n\xe2\x80\x9cnumber of wings\xe2\x80\x9d category. Similarly, the realistic options for \xe2\x80\x9cwing morphing\xe2\x80\x9d would be to\nhave no wing morphing, variable camber morphing, planform morphing, or simultaneous\nvariable camber and planform morphing. It is important to populate the list with as many\nalternatives as one can think of, also allowing for capabilities which may not be developed now\nbut are projected to be fully developed by the N+3 timeframe. These alternatives serve as\n15\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\npossible \xe2\x80\x9cchoices\xe2\x80\x9d in the IRMA, guiding the users in creating vehicle concepts. The alternatives\nare populated across a row for each entry created in the functional taxonomy. Once the\nalternatives have been entered, the morphological matrix is complete and the backbone for the\nIRMA is set.\n\nWing\nS&C\nPropulsor\nIntegration\n\nVehicle Characteristics\n\nFuselage\n\nThe complete morphological matrix created by Boeing and GE for the SUGAR workshop is\nshown in Figure 3.4.\nNumber of Fuselages\nWing-Body Blend\nNo. of Passenger Decks\nNumber\nLocation\nHigh Lift System\nBracing\nJoin\nFolding\nMorphing\nWinglet\nPitch Effecter\nYaw Effecter\nRoll Effecter\nLocation\nPropulsor Type\nPropulsor Arrangement\nEnergy Conversion\nAugmentation\nPrimary Fuel\n\nAlternative #1\nAlternative #2\n0\n1\nNone\nFairing\n1\n1.5\n1\n2\nLow\nMid\nConventional\nTriple Slotted Flap\nNone\nStrut\nNone\nTip\nNone\nIn Flight\nNone\nPlanform\nNone\nConventional\nConv.

The goal of conditional relationships is to\neliminate alternatives that are physically incompatible with each other. For example, if the user\ninitially selected a flying wing configuration with no fuselage, it would be unnecessary and\nphysically impossible, to have any type of wing bracing or join. Therefore, the alternatives under\nthese categories on other rows of the matrix would be removed as alternatives for the vehicle\nconfiguration.\nIt is important to note that the incompatibilities being dealt with merely reflect those vehicle\nattributes which are impossible by the laws of physics or by engineering standards. These\nincompatibilities do not reflect combinations of attributes which may be uncommon or suggested\nagainst. This allows for more freedom in generating concepts. It is important that the users also\napply their engineering judgment when making decisions to ensure the designs are not only\nphysically possible, but also logical, as incompatibilities cannot account for engineering logic.\nThe compatibility matrix should be filled in by those who helped populate the morphological\nmatrix. It is helpful if each individual fills out the compatibility matrix for those attributes which\nfall under their discipline specialty. The compatibility matrix is symmetrical and at minimum,\nconsists of the numbers 1 and 0. A 0 indicates that two alternatives are incompatible while a 1\nindicates they are compatible. The compatibility covers alternatives in the same row as the\nattribute in question as well as those alternatives in other rows that affect other aspects of the\nvehicle architecture.

When an alternative is selected, any alternatives that will\ncouple with the previously selected one and thereby improve performance will be highlighted for\nthe user to view. However, the SUGAR team elected not to incorporate this option into the\ncompatibility matrix.\nOnce the compatibility matrix is complete, it is linked to the morphological matrix to enable\ndynamic decision making. The results of the compatibility will automatically be reflected to the\nuser with each choice made during the workshop. This can be seen in Figure 3.6. The red cells\nindicate those options which have been ruled out due to the incompatibility matrix. Which cells\nappear red is a result of choices selected previously in the decision making chain (these choices\nare marked with a green \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d) and helps to drive vehicle concept design. This is a function of\nIRMA and will be discussed in more detail in the workshop section of this report.

Red cells indicate incompatible options.\n\nPre-workshop Step 5.2: Identify and discuss attributes of each row of the decomposition\nOnce the backbone of the IRMA has been completed, it is important to go over the results of the\nfunctional decomposition to ensure it is comprehensive. Additionally, it is important to discuss\neach attribute and alternative to ensure that the function and meaning of each is understood by all\nthose involved. It is also especially important to identify the benefit or cost of each attribute and\nalternative, in this case to identify how each affects aircraft performance relative to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\ngoals. Understanding the importance of each attribute is crucial to the next pre-workshop step.\nAdditionally, it allows the users to scrutinize the choices they made in the functional\ndecomposition to ensure that the problem can be adequately addressed with those attributes listed\nin the matrix.\nPre-workshop Step 6: Rank order decomposition based on relative importance to requirements\nUsing the discussions begun in step 5.2, it is important to set up the basics for IRMA scoring by\nidentifying the importance of each functional attribute to the problem. IRMA scoring ensures\nthat those decisions which most directly impact the customer requirements get weightings\nreflecting their importance. For example, fuel burn is highly affected by the aircraft propulsor\ntype. Therefore, the functional attribute \xe2\x80\x9cpropulsor type\xe2\x80\x9d would be given a high rating such that\nit would count highly towards the overall score of the vehicle concept. Additionally, knowing the\npropulsor type is an attribute highly affecting fuel burn, the user is given a logical place to start\nthe decision making process. Because of the incompatibility matrix, the order in which decisions\nare made will affect the vehicle architecture options available towards the end of the decision\nmaking chain. Therefore, it is important to begin making decisions with those attributes that will\nmost highly affect the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s performance.\nIn order to use the rankings effectively in the decision making process, each attribute must be\nevaluated prior to the workshop. For this instance, each attribute was evaluated for its effect on\neach one of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s goals. The attributes are marked as having a high impact, medium impact,\nlow impact, or no impact on a specific goal. The impact may be positive or negative; a positive\nor negative influence is accounted for during the workshop when scoring each alternative. The\n\xe2\x80\x9chigh-none\xe2\x80\x9d scale allows for the user to think of the problem qualitatively rather than\nquantitatively while still capturing the importance of a specific attribute. Once the attributes have\nbeen rated, the stage is set to allow for more logical, effective decision making, allowing those\ndecisions which are more critical to vehicle performance relative to a certain goal to occur early\non in the chain of decisions.\n\n18\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nThis step is performed both pre-workshop and during the workshop. Conducting this exercise\nprior to the workshop helps users ensure that the matrix is complete and its entries are\nunderstood. Conducting the exercise during the workshop helps check the work done before the\nworkshop and brings all participants together. It is important that the rankings are as accurate as\npossible, as they end up driving the decision making process heavily.\nPre-workshop Step 7: Select optimal suitable reference systems\nBefore groups can come together and begin to brainstorm unique vehicle concepts at the\nworkshop, it is important that everyone be given a frame of reference in which they must make\ndecisions. This frame of reference includes a baseline vehicle as well as the type of mission for\nwhich the vehicle is being designed.\nThe baseline vehicle provides a reference system for users when they are scoring alternatives in\nthe workshop. During the workshop, each alternative will be given a score (1-10) reflecting how\nwell they contribute to the customer goals. In this case, the score reflects how well an alternative\nwill improve performance towards specific NASA goal. Knowing the features of the baseline,\nthe user is able to make these decisions relative to existing systems. For example, the baseline\nalternative may be given a score of 5. Each alterative can then be scored against that, being given\na higher score if it improves performance or a lower score if it hinders performance.\nAdditionally, choosing a reference mission is important prior to the workshop. The reference\nmission stipulates such decisions as the class of vehicle being designed and the mission it will be\nexpected to perform. Users will make different design choices for a regional jet than for a long\nrange aircraft. In order to minimize confusion, it is important to stipulate these parameters ahead\nof time so everyone may understand the context in which they are designing.\nThe SUGAR team selected a 2008 technology conventional configuration (similar to 737NG) as\nthe baseline aircraft and assumed a medium range aircraft flying at approximately M=0.7 for all\nvehicle concepts created.\nHaving these guidelines gives structure to the workshop and ensures the participants are able to\neffectively contribute to the overall workshop process.\nPre-workshop Step 8: Exercise IRMA\nThe group is now ready to exercise the IRMA at the workshop. The IRMA will simply aid the\ngroup in the decision making process by providing structure and support for the conceptual\ndesign process. The steps of the workshop and details on how the IRMA is used to aid dynamic\ndecision making will be discussed in the next section of this report. A complete IRMA, ready for\na workshop, is depicted in Figure 3.7. Again, this IRMA is a notional example and does not\nreflect real decisions made prior to the workshop.\n\n19\n\nWing\nS&C\nPropulsor\nIntegration\n\nVehicle Characteristics\n\nFuselage\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nNumber of Fuselages\nWing-Body Blend\nNo. of Passenger Decks\nNumber\nLocation\nHigh Lift System\nBracing\nJoin\nFolding\nMorphing\nWinglet\nPitch Effecter\nYaw Effecter\nRoll Effecter\nLocation\nPropulsor Type\nPropulsor Arrangement\nEnergy Conversion\nAugmentation\nPrimary Fuel\n\nMetrics Selection\nAlternatives (First)\nEnergy\nOrder of\nConsumed Selection\nAlternative #1\nScore Select\nAlternative #2\nScore Select Alternative #3\nScore Select\nAlternative #4\nScore Select Alternative #5 Score Select\nNone\n0\n1\n2\nNone\nNone\nFairing\nModerate Blend\nExtreme Blend\nNone\n1\n1.5\n2\nMed\n1\n2\nMed\nLow\nMid\nHigh\nPylon Mount\nLow-High\nHigh\nConventional\nTriple Slotted Flap\nUSB\nEBF\nIBF\nLow\nNone\nStrut\nCable\nTruss\nLow\nNone\nTip\nMid\nBox\nMed\nNone\nIn Flight\nOn Ground\nLow\nNone\nPlanform\nVariable Camber\nBoth\nHigh\nNone\nConventional\nRaked\nFeathers\nMorphing\nLow\nConv.

The Interactive Reconfigurable Matrix of\nAlternatives (IRMA), information on specific technologies, information on the baseline vehicle,\ninformation on mission requirements and information for the NASA goals will be provided to\neach of the teams. The IRMA integrates the decomposition of requirements, the alternatives in\nthe matrix of alternatives and the compatibility matrix in an interactively accessible format.\nThe workshop participants consist of a subset of the individuals who participated in the preworkshop activities and other technical experts who may not have been involved in the preworkshop activities. These participants were selected by their past experience in specific\ntechnology areas, configuration design or possess a broad understanding of engineering trades.\n20\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nThe purpose of the Workshop Step 1 is to orient the participants to the mission that they are\ndesigning for and the steps that they will be required to go through during the workshop.\nAn orientation for the tools that will be available to them along with reference vehicle and\nmission information. Furthermore, each of the groups will be required to select architectures that\nrelate to each of the functional metrics. These metrics were specified by NASA and refined in\nthe earlier phases of the program.\nWorkshop Step 2: Score Matrix of Alternatives\nThe participants were broken up into three groups consisting of an averaged level of experience,\nboth on years of experience and technical expertise. These groups worked together to identify the\ninitial aircraft configurations for each of the NASA Goals or \xe2\x80\x9cMetrics of Interest\xe2\x80\x9d (MOI).\nThe teams investigated a single MOI and qualitatively ranked the benefit of each characteristic\nrelative to the MOI. The groups identified the characteristics with high benefits progressing from\nmedium to identifying characteristics with low or no benefit to the MOI. This progressive\nidentification of relative benefit supplies the team with a general \xe2\x80\x9corder of selection\xe2\x80\x9d to be used\nin the future.

In this conceptual phase of the program,\nperforming a sizing algorithm on the alternatives is premature. In order to bring the concept to\nlife and understand different individual\xe2\x80\x99s interpretations of the integration aspect of the design\nchoices, each member of the group will sketch each of the proposed aircraft.\nThe result is a collage of interpretations of drawings. The teams then compared individual\nsketches for each of the different aircraft and reach group consensus on what the aircraft should\nlook like. Based on the results of the discussions, the team will redraw the concepts\nincorporating any changes. An example of one of the group\xe2\x80\x99s original interpretations and final\ndrawing is depicted below in Figure 3.13.\n\nFigure 3.13 \xe2\x80\x93 Concept sketches\n\n23\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nWorkshop Step 5: Down-select among group concepts\nAt this stage of the workshop, there exist at least three concepts to meet each of the NASA goals.\nIn order to arrive at a select few configurations to apply technologies toward, the teams regroup\nand present their concepts.\nEach team presents their concept sketch and provides discussion for the rational for their\nconfiguration selection. Since different alternatives for each of the vehicle characteristics provide\nadvantages and disadvantages alone as well as the integrated, the teams discuss the expected pros\nand cons for their concepts.\nOnce all the groups have discussed their concepts, the large group down-selects to one or two\nconcepts per metric. To facilitate the down-select, the group compares the concepts to each of\nthe metrics of interest based on the perceived pros and cons of each concept. The group discusses\ncommonalities among all concepts, configuration selection issues and integration issues which\nmay lead to reassessing the configuration selection. Upon reaching consensus, the large group\nwill arrive at a concept or two for each metric as and repeats the concept selection process to\nidentify a configuration that represents a compromise between all metrics.

By\nexercising the interactive tool, the teams were able to gain an enhanced understanding of the\nsystems selections for the vehicle characteristics and the impacts of selecting a particular\nalternative without the need of exercising expensive analysis codes. The tool\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic nature\nand extensible, flexible framework allowed for the down-selection process to be rapidly repeated\nin order to select multiple configuration alternatives. This tool also facilitated discussions related\nto all major components of the aircraft and the integration issues.\nThe process used for exercising the tool provided a systematic process to obtain a sufficient set\nof reference systems and a mechanism for documenting the decisions that were made over the\ncourse of the workshop. The resulting files were given to the participants for use in further\nanalysis in the follow on phases of the contract.\n\n3.5 \xe2\x80\x93 Post Workshop Selection of Concepts for Detailed Analysis\nThe Concept Workshop resulted in six advanced concepts (Figure 3.15). It was decided that\nbecause of resource limitations, only one HWB concept would be considered and that it would\nemphasize low noise (Combined DNL #2) rather than performance (Combined Fuel Burn #2).\nThere were two possible architectures for the \xe2\x80\x9cCombined NOx and Emissions\xe2\x80\x9d concept: One\nusing fuel cells and the other batteries. Therefore, two reference concepts and six advanced\nconcepts were selected for consideration (Figure 3.16).\n25\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nN Baseline\n\nN+3 Reference\n\nN+3 Improved L/D\n\nN+3 Fuel Cell\n\nN+3 Emissions\n(Batteries)\n\nN+3 Reduced Noise HWB\n\nN+3 TOFL\n\nN+3 Reduced Noise\n\nFigure 3.16 \xe2\x80\x93 Candidate Configurations for Detailed Analysis\n\nBased on available contract resources, we decided to focus our efforts on the corner points of the\ndesign space that appeared the most challenging and to reduce the number of advanced concepts\nto three. To achieve this, we decided to group the fuel-cell, battery, and hybrid electric aircraft\ninto an \xe2\x80\x9cElectric Trade Aircraft\xe2\x80\x9d. The HWB configuration was judged to be the configuration\nwith the best chance of making the aggressive N+3 low noise goal, so it was selected over a strut\nbraced wing configuration with tail shielding. The dedicated take-of-field-length (TOFL)\noptimized aircraft was dropped in favor of looking at TOFL sensitivities for one or more of the\nother configurations (Figure 3.17). All of the eliminated configurations have merit, and should be\nconsidered for inclusion in future studies. The five aircraft selected for detailed analysis are\nshown in Figure 3.18, and are summarized below:\n1. SUGAR Free \xe2\x80\x93 Current technology, similar to 737 class aircraft. Used as Baseline for\nperformance comparisons.\n2. Refined SUGAR \xe2\x80\x93 Reference conventional configuration with estimated 2030-2035\ntechnologies.

A variation of this\nconfiguration with N+3 advanced technologies will be provided for direct comparison to\nthe advanced concepts.\n3.

Each of these engines was designed to the thrust requirements for\ntheir respective point-of-departure vehicle designs (Section 5.1.3) and each is shown\napproximately to scale. The engines were given the informal designations \xe2\x80\x9ceFan\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cfFan\xe2\x80\x9d,\n\xe2\x80\x9cgFan\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cgFan+\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9chFan\xe2\x80\x9d. Starting at the top left of the figure, the baseline engine for this\nstudy is a conventional gas turbine (GT), the CFM56 with a 61\xe2\x80\x9d fan diameter and 27,000 pound\ntakeoff thrust rating. The \xe2\x80\x9ceFan\xe2\x80\x9d is an all-electric propulsor that is basically an electric motor\nconnected to a high bypass fan via a gearbox. The electric power required to drive this propulsor\nis derived from a source external to the propulsor itself.\n\nFigure 3.20 \xe2\x80\x93 GE Engine Family for Consideration in SUGAR Vehicles\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cfFan\xe2\x80\x9d is a fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid concept featuring a single spool gas generator\nattached to the same shaft as an electric motor. A portion of the compressor discharge air is\npulled from the primary flowpath via a scroll system and fed to a fuel cell stack external to the\npropulsion nacelle (not shown). The exhaust effluent from the fuel cell is then fed back into the\ncombustor and subsequently expanded in the turbine. The electric power from the fuel cell is\nused to power the electric motor/fan for some portions of the mission, provide electric power to\nairframe systems, and (possibly) power external electric propulsion units.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cgFan\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgFan+\xe2\x80\x9d engines are advanced high bypass 2-spool turbofan engines. The\nprimary difference between the two is that the \xe2\x80\x9cgFan+\xe2\x80\x9d represents an aggressive push on gas\nturbine technology whereas the \xe2\x80\x9cgFan\xe2\x80\x9d is intended to be an extrapolation on were gas turbine\ntechnology will be in 2035 given a more moderate (but still aggressive) pace of development.\nFinally, the \xe2\x80\x9chFan\xe2\x80\x9d is a gas turbine-electric hybrid engine capable of operating in an all gas\nturbine, all-electric, or combined modes depending on mission requirements, where the electric\npower is assumed to come from a source external to the engine (e.g. batteries).\n\n29\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9ceFan\xe2\x80\x9d engines, when integrated on the point-of-departure version of the SUGAR Volt,\ncould not achieve the needed 3,500 nmi mission range without assuming a phenomenal\nimprovement in battery technology relative to today\xe2\x80\x99s state-of-the-art. The \xe2\x80\x9cfFan\xe2\x80\x9d showed some\npromise, but was ultimately not as competitive as the \xe2\x80\x9chFan\xe2\x80\x9d engine concept. This, in\ncombination with the challenges of realizing a compact, lightweight, high power output, primereliable fuel cell subsystem, deterred further work on the \xe2\x80\x9cfFan\xe2\x80\x9d concept. As such, only the\n\xe2\x80\x9chFan\xe2\x80\x9d was selected for more detailed analysis and sizing on the SUGAR Volt.\nFinally, one area holding considerable promise toward meeting the aggressive fuel burn goals of\nthis project is the open fan. Open fan is also desirable from an emissions reduction point of view\ninasmuch as emissions are correlated to fuel burn. Open fan is less desirable from the point of\nview of meeting the very aggressive noise goals of this project, though it is clear that\nconsiderable progress could be made in this area with concerted effort.\nIt was clear at the outset that the number of possible engine concepts worthy of study in this\nproject far outstrips the resources available. Furthermore, it was clear that the team would need\nto set a strategy on how to approach the number of engine concepts to be evaluated versus the\ndepth of analysis. In general, the philosophy of this study has been to study a fewer number of\nthe most promising engine concepts, and to do so at a level of analysis fidelity conducive to\ndrawing useful conclusions from the results.\nThus, the team made a conscious decision early in this study to eschew the detailed evaluation of\nan open fan in favor of spending additional time and resources developing other \xe2\x80\x9cout of the box\xe2\x80\x9d\nconcepts such as fuel cell and electric hybrids. Furthermore, open fan is presently being studied\nby industry and NASA in other venues. It therefore seems logical to focus the bulk of the effort\nin this project on those concepts that have heretofore received little or no attention.\nAs a result, the open fan is evaluated in only the most rudimentary way for this project.\nSpecifically, the open fan\xe2\x80\x99s impact on vehicle fuel burn is estimated by treating the open fan as a\nsimple cruise SFC delta and an engine weight delta applied on top of the \xe2\x80\x9cgFan+\xe2\x80\x9d engine\nperformance and weight estimates. This is sufficient to give some insight as to how the open fan\nperformance benefit might be expected to impact the sized vehicle system. No attempt was made\nto evaluate open fan noise, as this would have required considerable effort and would have\ndetracted from resources available to develop other concepts.\nTo recap, propulsion selections and top level technology assumptions are summarized below:\no N Baseline (SUGAR Free)\no CFM56\no Fuel burn Baseline\no N+3 Reference (Refined SUGAR)\no \xe2\x80\x9cgFan\xe2\x80\x9d\no High bypass ratio turbofan with 2030 engine technologies\no SFC reduction goal of 20%\no N+3 High L/D (SUGAR High)\no \xe2\x80\x9cgFan+\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n30\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\no High bypass ratio turbofan\no An open fan variant was also evaluated at a very high level using simple weight\nand SFC deltas relative to the \xe2\x80\x9cgFan+\xe2\x80\x9d concept\no Advanced technologies to improve engine performance relative to Refined\nSUGAR\no SFC reduction goal of 25%\no N+3 Electric Trade Aircraft (SUGAR Volt)\no \xe2\x80\x9chFan\xe2\x80\x9d\no Ducted fan\no Hybrid gas turbine-battery electric architecture\no Fuel cell hybrid (\xe2\x80\x9cfFan\xe2\x80\x9d) and battery electric (\xe2\x80\x9ceFan\xe2\x80\x9d) versions were evaluated\nbut not selected for further analysis\no N+3 Low Noise HWB (SUGAR Ray)\no \xe2\x80\x9cgFan+\xe2\x80\x9d (same as SUGAR High)\n\n31\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n4.0 \xe2\x80\x93 Advanced Technologies Selection\nThis section provides a brief overview of the technologies included in this study.\n\n4.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Aerodynamics Technologies\nA team of aerodynamicists developed a list of technologies that would be applicable to a 20302035 technology aircraft. The technologies to be applied to vehicles are shown in Table 4.1. As\ncost was not considered directly, trade studies were not performed to determine the optimum mix\nof technologies for each vehicle. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) determined the matching of the\ntechnologies to the configurations.\nTable 4.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Aero Technology Summary\nConfiguration\n\xe2\x80\x98N\xe2\x80\x99\nSUGAR Free\nLaminar Flow\nAero Technology Areas\n\nRiblets\nExcrescence\nDrag\nEmpennage\nAirfoil\nTechnology\nAdditional\nTechnologies\n\nNone\n\n\xe2\x80\x98N+3\xe2\x80\x99\nRefined\nSUGAR\nNatural /\nPassive\n\n\xe2\x80\x98N+3\xe2\x80\x99\nSUGAR High\n\n\xe2\x80\x98N+3\xe2\x80\x99\nSUGAR Volt\n\n\xe2\x80\x98N+3\xe2\x80\x99\nSUGAR Ray\n\nNatural, Passive and Active Where Appropriate\n\nFuselage, Wing, Tails,\nTBD\nNacelles Where Appropriate\nMulti-Functional Structures,\nConventional\nReduced Fasteners,\nReduced Flap Fairings, Gapless\nConventional\nC.G.

Drag Reduction is accomplished by delaying the buildup of two primary\ntransition mechanisms, Stationary Cross-Flow (SCF) and Tollmien-Schlicting (T-S) waves. For\nthe SUGAR study, the following strategies are discussed:\n-\n\nNatural Laminar Flow (NLF): is achieved through shaping. Wing airfoil design with\nextended favorable gradients delays the buildup of T-S waves.\n\n-\n\nPassive Laminar Flow: is similar to Hybrid Laminar Flow but does not require power for\na suction system. The delta pressure needed for suction is designed into the airplane.\n\n-\n\nHybrid Laminar Flow (HLFC): employs suction in a non-structural region ahead of the\nfront spar and design for favorable gradients to sustain laminar flow over the wing box.\nPower is still needed for the suction system.\n\n32\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n-\n\nActive Laminar Flow: is achieved through integrating the suction system with the\nstructural wing box to ensure laminar flow. This requires power and plumbing for the\nsuction system.\n\nAs shown in Table 4.1, different levels of laminar flow designs will be applied to each\nconfiguration. The trade between the strategies depends on the design features of the\nconfiguration. No trade studies will be performed to determine which level of laminar flow is to\nbe applied and the chosen amount will be determined by SMEs.\nKruger flaps were chosen for the low speed leading edge device. This provides the high lift\nneeded for low speed and is an enabler for laminar flow at cruise. The Kruger also stows below\nthe wing behind the attachment line providing a clean uninterrupted upper surface for laminar\nflow in cruise.\nIn the Aerodynamic drag buildup, the laminar surface area must be calculated to apply the proper\ndrag reduction relative to turbulent values. Transition Reynolds Number of 12 to 17 million\n(variation with span) was used to determine the extent of the laminar run in the streamline\ndirection. An eight-degree turbulent wedge created by the intersection of the body and the\nleading edge of the wing establish the inboard wing boundary for laminar flow. It is also\nassumed that NLF can achieve the same transition Reynolds number as HLFC. These\nassumptions were used in the Aerodynamic buildups.\n4.1.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Riblets\nRiblets have been studied for fuselage drag reduction in the past. They offer drag reduction but\ntraditionally are not damage tolerant. The lower surface of wings may also benefit but these\nsurfaces typically encounter more extreme environments resulting in riblet delamination. In these\nstudies, aircraft using the technology will assume features are manufactured into the vehicle\nwing skin or take the place of paint resulting in no weight change. A 7% drag benefit on skin\nfriction drag will be applied to each component using this technology (based on wind tunnel and\nflight tests).\n4.1.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Excrescence Drag\nApplication of multi-functional structures, reduction in fasteners, reduced flap fairings, and\nsealed surfaces will result in a 20% reduction of excrescence drag. Structures enables a portion\nof this savings, the rest comes from reduced flap fairings resulting from optimized high lift\nsystems.\n4.1.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Empennage\nReducing the tail size for horizontals and verticals attained through active CG management and\nincreased design lift coefficient results in drag reduction. This is reflected in the configuration\ngeometry and is not explicitly carried as an aerodynamics increment.\n4.1.5 \xe2\x80\x93 Airfoil Technology\nAdvanced supercritical airfoil technology will be applied to the baseline and reference vehicles.\nThe SUGAR High and SUGAR Volt configurations will benefit from higher cruise lift\ncoefficients compared to conventional configurations. A 3% reduction in airplane drag is\nassumed from wind tunnel derived database levels for a given lift coefficient based on wing\ndesign studies.\n33\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n4.1.6 \xe2\x80\x93 Additional Aero Technologies\nAdditional technologies include low drag strut integration, low interference drag nacelle, and\nairframe noise shielding. For the strut-braced wing a 4.8% drag improvement was used over\nempirical methods. Low interference nacelle assumes an interference drag free installation.\nAirframe noise shielding is an Aerodynamic technology which enables future takeoff and\napproach operations.\n\n4.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Structural Technologies\nA team of structural engineers developed a list of technologies that would be applicable to a\n2030-2035 technology aircraft. The technologies, and vehicles they can be applied on, are shown\nin Table 4.2. As cost was not considered directly, trade studies were not performed to determine\nthe optimum mix of technologies for each vehicle. The application of the technologies was left to\nthe aircraft designers and discipline experts.\nTable 4.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Structural Technologies Summary\n\n\xe2\x80\x98N\xe2\x80\x99\nSUGAR Free\nAluminum\n\nLoads &\nEnvironments\n\nNone\n\nDesign & Criteria\nStructural Technology Areas\n\nMaterials /\nManufacturing\nHealth\nManagement\n\nDeterministic\n\nAdaptive\nStructures for\nControl Systems\nEnergy\nManagement\nCoatings\nInteriors\n\nAdditional\nStructures\nTechnologies\n\nNone OnBoard\n\nConventional\nNo Structural\nIntegration\nConventional\nPaint and\nCorrosion\nPrev.\nStandard\n\nNone\n\nConfiguration\n\xe2\x80\x98N+3\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x98N+3\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x98N+3\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x98N+3\xe2\x80\x99\nRefined\nSUGAR\nSUGAR\nSUGAR Ray\nSUGAR\nHigh\nVolt\nAdv.

The estimated structural weight reductions for advanced materials\nare shown in Table 4.3. These are based on expected improvements in critical material properties\nand the distribution of the dominant material properties.\nTable 4.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Advanced Material Applications and Improvements\nComponent\nStrength Dominated Structure\nStiffness Dominated Structure\nMetallic Structure\nLanding Gear\nAll Structure\nHigh Temperature Structure\n\nWeight\nReduction\n15%\n25%\n10%\n25%\n15%\n25%\n\nMaterial Type\nAdvanced Composites\nAdvanced Composites\nAdvanced Metals\nAdvanced Materials (MMC / CMC)\nAdvanced Joining\nAdvanced Ceramics\n\n4.2.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Structural Health Management (SHM)\nThis is an enabling technology required for the weight reductions claimed in Sections 4.2.1 and\n4.2.3. The technology works in close conjunction with non-deterministic design criteria by\npermitting reduced conservatism in the structural design criteria. The amount of structural weight\nthat can be reduced depends upon the critical structural sizing criteria and the damage\nassumptions built into those criteria. The primary structural weight savings results from the\nenhanced knowledge of the probability of occurrence of damage scenarios coupled with\nquantitative knowledge of actual damage events. This permits damaged structure to be designed\nfor Design Limit Load (DLL) or in some cases for 70% of DLL. Full application of this\ntechnology to save weight will require significant changes to current aircraft design requirements\nand methods.\nThe weight penalty for this SHM system itself is estimated to add 0.005 pounds per square foot\nto all wing and fuselage wetted areas. This SHM weight is based on our experience using current\ntechnology piezoelectric guided wave technology, but assumes in the 2030 time frame we take\nfull advantage of advanced structurally integrated wiring technology (Direct Write) to reduce\nSHM system weight allowing for large area coverage at very high sensor density. Structural\nweight reduction is estimated to be dependent upon SHM sensor density as shown in Figure 4.1.\nThe weight savings are estimated at 5% - 30% away from fastener holes, 5% - 12% near edges\nand fastener attachment holes. It is expected that bonded/welded structural joining will result in a\nlarge reduction in the use of fasteners.\n\n35\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n35\nLarge Damage Critical\n\n30\n\n% Weight Reduction\n\nSmall Notch Critical\n\n25\n\nBarely Visible Damage\nCritical\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0.00\n\n0.20\n\n0.40\n\n0.60\n\n0.80\n\n1.00\n\n1.20\n\nSensor density (#/in)\n\nFigure 4.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Structural Weight Reduction Expeccted from SHM\n\n4.2.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Loads and Environments\nLoad alleviation is currently being used on Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s latest aircraft. Conservatively extrapolating\nthis technology to 2030 would yield about a 15% reduction in wing weight due to Gust Load\nAlleviation and Maneuver Load Alleviation. A significant technology push in this area will\nprovide the ability to integrate active aeroelastic response control into the flight controls and\nenable the tailoring of spanwise load control into the flight controls. This is likely a larger benefit\nto high aspect ratio configurations and 25% reduction is estimated for the high aspect ratio\nconfigurations.\n4.2.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Design and Criteria \xe2\x80\x93 Reliability Based Loads and Design\nStructural Health Management (SHM) technology will work in conjunction with a transition\nfrom current deterministic structural design methods to probabilistic analyses, also known as\nReliability Based Design. This will have the dual advantage of quantifying the actual reliability\nof a structure in terms of both probability distributions of load levels and probability distributions\nof load carrying capability. SHM sensors will provide real time data to validate both probability\ndistributions (applied load levels) and the current load carrying capabilities of the structures. The\njoint probability of these distributions will define reliability of the structure and dictate\nrestrictions as required to assure safe operation of the aircraft. Taking advantage of these\ntechnologies will require a significant shift in structural design requirements and practices that\ncan only be achieved through an extended evolution of these criteria to assure continued\nairworthiness throughout the transition.\n4.2.5 \xe2\x80\x93 Adaptive Structures and Control Systems\nAdaptive structures and control systems are assumed to allow a 50% reduction in complex high\nlift systems and a 20% reduction in simple high lift systems. High Lift and control surface\n36\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nsystems currently comprise approximately 50% of the weight of typical commercial aircraft\nwings. It is estimated that conformal wing shape change (adaptive structures, sometimes known\nas morphing) will provide benefits that include reduced weight for high lift systems primarily\nthrough simplification of these structures. Additional benefits include significantly reduced noise\nthrough elimination of slat and flap gaps and possibly reduced drag due to elimination of gaps\nand joints between flaps and control surfaces and the main wing surface. Elimination of such\ngaps will also support the drag reduction estimates by supporting enhanced laminar flow.\nBecause of the reduced need for extensive high lift systems for the high aspect ratio concepts,\nonly 20% reduction is estimated for SUGAR High and Volt.\n4.2.6 \xe2\x80\x93 Integrated Energy Management\nIntegrated energy management provides reduced overall aircraft weight through the use of\nelectrical and thermal management approaches that are highly integrated with aircraft structure.\nElectrical power distribution systems in addition to wiring weight include parasitic structural\nweight required to attach wiring to the structure as well as weight penalty due to the required\nstructural penetrations. As subsystems thermal loads continually increase, conducting those heat\nloads will require increasingly complex thermal energy management technologies. Using\nstructure as thermal conduction paths will reduce overall aircraft weight.\n4.2.7 \xe2\x80\x93 Coatings\nA 50% Reduction in paint weight has been estimated base on use of advanced coatings and\nappliqu\xc3\xa9. Advanced coatings also enable the use of advanced metals.\n4.2.8 \xe2\x80\x93 Interiors\nA 5% reduction in insulation weight is estimated using advanced insulation materials and\nthrough integration of insulation with structure. A 20% reduction in weight of interior walls and\nseats is also estimated.\n4.2.9 \xe2\x80\x93 Multi-functional Structures Technologies\nMulti-functional design and integrated systems/structures technology has been estimated to yield\na 50% reduction in wiring weight. Further reductions are expected through structural integration\nof thermal and electrical energy management systems and components and of lightning\nprotection.\n4.2.10 \xe2\x80\x93 Additional Structures Technologies\nAdditional technologies include environmentally friendly manufacturing processes, and features\nsuch as lightweight wing folds for large span aircraft and adaptive structural features such as\nvariable geometry wing tips, adaptive wing camber and adaptive engine inlets and nozzles. Large\nunitized structures will reduce the weight of joints. Hybrid composite and metallic structures\nwith advanced joining technology will permit the usage of the best materials depending upon\napplication.\n\n4.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Subsystem Technologies\nBoeing technology engineers compiled a list of anticipated subsystem technologies that could be\navailable in the 2030 timeframe (Table 4.4).

Power demands are driven by payloads and TOGW. ECS\nloads drive power requirements for steady state and are dependent primarily on the payload and\ncabin altitude constraints while landing gear, and control system power loads are aircraft weight\nand technology driven. Passenger comfort enhancements like lower cabin altitude, in flight\nentertainment systems, and reduced recirculation ECS all increase power demand. However,\npeak power demand may be reduced by intelligent power management systems.\nIt should be noted that for all \xe2\x80\x98N+3\xe2\x80\x99 airplanes the ECS is expected to be completely electrified\nincorporating more advanced generations of the \xe2\x80\x9c787 No-Bleed Electrical Systems\nArchitecture\xe2\x80\x9d. The primary motivation for the no-bleed architecture is fuel burn reduction, as\nwell as improved airplane maintenance and dispatch reliability. The architecture incorporates\nhighly efficient electrical cabin pressurization scheme utilizing adjustable speed electrical\nmotors, as well as electrical wing ice protection, engine starting, and driving the high capacity\nhydraulic pumps if required. The engine start function is accomplished via starter/generators that\nact as the starter motors for the engines, as well as providing electrical power when the\nrespective engine is running.\nTable 4.5 shows the power requirements for each configuration. It also shows the peak power\nreduction attained by the use of advanced energy management.

These top level requirements were turned into specific\npayload-range requirements which are illustrated in Figure 5.1. The figure has several points of\ninterest called out.\n1. The airplane is required to fly the average range at max payload (also maximum zero fuel\nweight). Max payload is required to be 15,200 pounds heavier than the payload from\npoint 2 for a Medium sized airplane.\n2. The airplane is required to fly the maximum range at the average number of seats using\n200 pounds per passenger and no revenue payload. This point must be achieved using\nless than 90% of the useable fuel.\n3. This point will be used to calculate vehicle fuel burn performance and TOFL\nperformance for the SUGAR program. This represents the point that represents how an\noperator would most commonly operate the vehicle class.\nMax Zero Fuel Weight\n1\n\nLow Density Payload\n2\n\nAverage Range\n\nMaximum Range\n\nPayload\n\n3\n\nRange\n\nFigure 5.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Payload-Range Requirements\n\nBoth point 1 and 2 are required for sizing because airplane characteristics may change which\npoint is critical.\n5.1.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Configuration Synthesis Ground Rules\nCritical requirements shape conceptual airplane configurations. Several configuration rules have\nbeen utilized for the SUGAR study.\nOverall Configuration: When an advanced concept is developed, it is often difficult to\ndetermine which performance advancements are attained because of the configuration layout and\nwhich are obtained due to technology improvements. In response to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s request, the team\nhas developed an N+3 reference airplane to help separate the performance improvements. The N\n42\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nand N+3 reference vehicles are required to topologically be 737 like layouts (also known as tubeand-wing). Both will have turbofans, low wings, conventional tail layouts, etc. All the advanced\nconcepts are allowed to take whatever form makes the integration developed during the Georgia\nTech workshop possible.\nInterior Arrangement: The interior layout of the all configured aircraft will be generated using\nthe appropriate rules for the vehicle size. For regional aircraft this is a single class arrangement\nwith relatively short seat pitch. For medium aircraft, dual class seating will be used. For Large\nconfigurations, long range tri-class rules will be used.\nSpan: Airport infrastructure is the primary reason for airplane span limitations. The future\nscenario predicts an increase of flight operations in the 2030 timeframe and airports are already\ncongested. Increasing the distance between gates, assuming the airport cannot expand, would\nreduce the number available thus reducing throughput. Secondly, a considerable amount of\ninfrastructure already exists that would have to be replaced if spans were increased beyond that\nof the current fleet. Span constraints are not just an issue at the gate. They are also an issue on\nrunways and taxiways.\nAirport regulations dealing with span limitations are described in an FAA Advisory Circular10. In\norder to accurately assess the impact of increasing airplane span beyond 118\xe2\x80\x99 a survey of which\nairports currently served by 737/A320 class airplanes would be affected is necessary. This would\ndetermine how much of current and projected service a larger span airplane would be unable to\nperform and how big an impact that would have on its utility and marketability. Table 5.1 shows\nall of Boeings commercial products FAA / ICAO designations.\nThe SUGAR team has decided that all Regional airliners should be Group I or II, a typical\nMedium airliner would be Group III, and that a Large airliner would be Groups IV thru VI.\nGreater spans are allowed on advanced concepts provided a folding mechanism is used to meet\nthe gate constraints. All folding is done AFTER landing or BEFORE takeoff. The airport\noperations aspect of takeoff and landing with high span has been ignored in this study and its\nimpact should be addressed in future studies.\n\n43\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nTable 5.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Airport Compatibility Group Codes\nAIRCRAFT\nFAA / ICAO DESIGNATION\nCODE\nI/A\nII / B\nIII / C\nIV / D\nV/E\nVI / F\n0 \xe2\x80\x93 49\xe2\x80\x99\n49 \xe2\x80\x93 79\xe2\x80\x99\n79 \xe2\x80\x93 118\xe2\x80\x99 118 \xe2\x80\x93 171\xe2\x80\x99 171 \xe2\x80\x93 214\xe2\x80\x99 214 \xe2\x80\x93 262\xe2\x80\x99\nSPAN\n0 \xe2\x80\x93 15m\n15 \xe2\x80\x93 24m\n24 \xe2\x80\x93 36m\n36 \xe2\x80\x93 52m\n52 \xe2\x80\x93 65m\n65 \xe2\x80\x93 80m\nLIMITS\nIV / D\n707\nIV / D\n720\nIII / C\n717\nIII / C\n727\nIII / C\n737\nV/E\n747\nIV / D\n757\nIV / D\n767\nV/E\n777\nIV / D\nDC-8\nIII / C\nDC-9\nIV / D\nDC-10\nIV\nE\nMD-11*\nIII / C\nMD-80\nIII / C\nMD-90\n* NOTE: MD-11 is the only aircraft that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remain in the same category between FAA\nand ICAO.

At first glance, the speed for maximum range\nappears to be a good choice for SUGAR vehicles, since a wide range of engine possibilities exist.\nUsing an initial sizing process (discussed in Section 5.1.3) several vehicles were optimized for\nvarying cruise Mach numbers. Initial cruise altitude (ICA) was allowed to vary but was limited\nto 43,000 ft. The fuel burn for these optimized aircraft is shown in Figure 5.3. Each vehicle is\noptimized to minimize fuel burn for the given Mach number. The curve clearly shows an\nadvantage for slowing down.\nFor this study we will adhere to the lower limit of Mach 0.70 for Medium sized airplanes as\nsuggested by the Boeing Current Market Outlook (CMO).\n5.1.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Initial Sizing and Points of Departure\nTo size the advanced configurations, an initial sizing tool was developed based on a combination\nof textbook aerodynamic methods, Douglas heritage compressibility tables, textbook mass\nproperties methods with span and strut corrections, a scaled engine deck, and simplistic stability\nand control for tail sizing. The analysis was calibrated to a known airplane and then used for\nsizing wing area and aspect ratio, while respecting span constraints and vehicle performance\nrequirements (Section 6.1.2). The tool accepts factors for technology impacts such as weight\nfactors and laminar flow percentage.\nSUGAR Free (765-093) is a 2008 technology conventional configuration sized for the 2008\nreference mission rules (discussed in Figure 6.2). The sizing for SUGAR Free is particularly\nimportant because it sets the baseline performance for all of the advanced configurations\nanalyzed for the contract. Simply analyzing or using the performance of an existing airplane\nwould not be acceptable for this study because it would not be sized for the mission defined by\nthe future scenario (either in number of passengers or range). Early in the analysis of SUGAR\nFree (765-093) it became clear that any span less than the constraint was a penalty. This leaves\nwing area, thickness to chord ratio, and sweep as the highest level optimization variables of\ninterest. Figure 5.4 shows the wing area trade using aspect ratio as a surrogate for wing area\n(span is fixed). Table 5.3 shows the input parameters and information on the selected initial\nsizing point for the configuration. Note that the effective aspect ratio and span include the virtual\nspan added from a winglet. The actual span was held to the constraint of 118 feet.\n\n46\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nTable 5.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Initial Sizing: 765-093 SUGAR Free Results\nVehicle Specifications:\n13,050\nEffective AR: 10.5\n13,000\nArea: 1,440\n12,950\nEffective Span: 123\n12,900\nt/c Root: 0.145\n12,850\nt/c Tip: 0.094\n12,800\nTaper Ratio: 0.18\n12,750\nCL Cruise: 0.625\nSweep: 20.0\xc2\xb0\n12,700\nL/D: 18.45\n12,650\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\nICA: 37,000\nWing Aspect Ratio\nOEW: 101,642\nFigure 5.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Initial Sizing: 765-093 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR\nTOGW: 175,635\nFree Aspect Ratio Trade\nSLS Thrust: 56,315\nFuel Burn (900nm): 12,681\nFuel Burn (lbs)\n\nConditions and\nAssumptions:\nMach: 0.78\nMax Range (nm): 3,500\nTOFL: 7,000\nICA: 37,000\nStrut: NO\nROC at ICA (fpm): 300\nCL Takeoff: 2.4\nReserves: N\nSFC Delta: 0%\nLaminar: NO\nRiblets: NO\nIndirect Routing: 5%\nTail Size Factor: 1.05\n\nRefined SUGAR (765-094) was sized in a similar way to SUGAR Free.

Even at 300,000 pounds\nthe battery powered airplane cannot make the\nrange requirement with very aggressive\nenergy densities. The battery powered\nairplane produces no in flight emissions,\nburns no fuel, and could potentially be very\nquiet. However, it was discarded from this\nstudy based on its inability to meet range\nrequirements for a medium sized airliner. It\ncould be attractive for Regional airplanes for\nmissions less than 1000 nm.\n\n6,000\n500\n5,500\n5,000\n\nFuel Cell\nWatts/kg\n\n-55%\n750\n\nThe Hybrid Brayton-Battery propulsion\n4,500\nsystem shows the greatest promise in reducing\n1,500\nvehicle fuel burn. The propulsion system is\n4,000\nenvisioned to have both a Brayton core and an\n180,000 220,000 260,000 300,000 340,000 380,000\nelectric motor powering a propulsor (fan or\nTOGW (lb)\nopen fan). The airplane performs takeoff and\nFigure 5.7 \xe2\x80\x93 Fuel burn from a Fuel Cell Powered\nclimb using power from both systems, but\nSUGAR Volt\nthrottles down one of the systems during\ncruise. Jet fuel powers the Brayton core and batteries power the electric motor. Maximizing\npropulsive energy use from batteries is desirable when trying to reduce fuel burn. However,\nbatteries have much lower energy density, limiting range under battery power alone. A key\nfeature of this concept is the ability to use modular batteries, so that the same vehicle can trade\nbattery and fuel depending on the mission. Generally, more fuel and fewer batteries are used for\nlong ranges, and less fuel and more batteries are used for short ranges. For all but the shortest\nmissions, the aircraft has the same takeoff weight, as illustrated in Figure 5.8.\nBy designing the vehicle to carry more battery weight (increase the design TOGW), greater\ndistances can be flown using energy from batteries. This results in lower jet fuel burn, but higher\nTOGW. Lower gross weights result in shorter range capability when cruising on electric\npropulsion only.

The component performance calculations for the typical gas turbine components were\nbased on GE standard calculation methods. Simplified PD representations were developed for\nnon-standard components, notably the electric motor and motor controller, such that the impact\nof those components on overall engine performance could be estimated for the eFan and hFan\nconcepts (the fFan concept was not evaluated to this level of analysis fidelity). The component\nperformance levels assumed were based on GE historical data for current engines with\nprojections for advances in the N+3 timeframe. Additional component performance corrections\nwere included based on specific technology concepts included in the basic engine design, as\nneeded. Cycle performance for the fFan concept was estimated via simple spreadsheet-type\ncalculations based on available fuel cell component performance data.\nEngine weight and flowpath geometry were estimated using GE internal tools. These tools utilize\na combination of physics-based analysis and historical correlations. These tools design to the\nlevel of estimating turbomachinery vector diagrams at the pitch line with corrections for hub and\ntip of each stage. Thus, the aeromechanical design is consistent with the cycle and suitable for\nfurther refinement if selected. Engine weights were adjusted to reflect materials technology\nassumptions. Electric motor and motor controller weights were scaled from a current state-of-the\nart machine with corrections to account for the assumed N+3 technology timeframe.\nEngine emissions were estimated based on GE internal correlations with adjustments to account\nfor the future progression of technology. Noise was estimated by anchoring to a known\ncomparable baseline. Estimates on noise deltas for specific noise reduction technologies were\nthen applied to this baseline at both the engine and airframe levels to arrive at an overall estimate\nof vehicle noise levels.\nA detailed evaluation of open fan engine concepts was beyond the intended scope of this study\ndue to resource constraints. However, this does not mean that the open fan isn\xe2\x80\x99t promising for\nthis application and it is desirable to at least give some insight into the potential benefit available\nfrom open fan concepts. Thus, the open fan was treated as a cruise SFC delta and an engine\nweight delta applied to the gFan+ engine concept. It should be noted that the open fan is\nexpected to be somewhat more challenging with respect to meeting the very aggressive N+3\nnoise goals. No attempt was made to assess the noise implications of open fan in this project.\n\n5.3 \xe2\x80\x93 765-093 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR Free (2008 Baseline Configuration)\nThe configuration that serves as a baseline for all metrics in our study is defined as the 765-093\n\xe2\x80\x98SUGAR Free\xe2\x80\x99.

This engine is shown in Figure 5.29 and features a\n66 OPR, 9.2 BPR, and relatively low hot section temperatures. The high OPR in conjunction\nwith advanced component aerodynamic and materials technologies gives this engine very good\nthermal efficiency. The modest hot section temperatures in conjunction with advanced TAPS\ncombustor technology make this engine very compatible with the aggressive N+3 emissions\ngoals. This engine features an advanced shrouded fan/nacelle arrangement that yield good noise\ncharacteristics. This engine makes extensive use of CMCs in the hot section both for weight\nreduction and performance improvement. Key geometry, performance and weight information\nfor this engine is provided in Table 5.13. This table also provides an overview of the various\ncomponent technologies employed in this engine.\nThe combustor selected for this engine is a generation beyond the advanced TAPS combustors\npresently being planned for future products. This \xe2\x80\x9cGEN++ TAPS\xe2\x80\x9d combustor is of generally\nsimilar design to today\xe2\x80\x99s TAPS system but with improved mixing and improved operability\nfeatures. This, in conjunction with significantly reduced cruise T4 levels relative to today\xe2\x80\x99s\nnarrowbody engines, enables drastic reductions in NOx emissions. It is anticipated that this\ncombustor design will yield significant reductions in particulate emissions levels. The impact on\ncontrail formation is a topic for future research and will be better defined as the combustor\ndesign progresses in the future.\n\n70\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nAdvanced Composite Fan\n1.4 PR, 70\xe2\x80\x9d fan\nAdvanced 3-D aero design\nSculpted features, low noise\n\nAdvanced nacelle\nHighly integrated\nMinimum OD\nUnitized composite\n\n4-Stage Booster\n\nAdvanced\ncombustor\n\nUltra-high PR core compressor\n66 OPR, 9 BPR\n9 stages\nHPT\n2-Stage\nCMC nozzles + blades\nAdvanced aero features\n\nLPT\n7-Stage\nModerate loading\nCMC & TiAl nozzles + blades\nIntegrated thrust reverser/ VFN\nVariable fan nozzle\n\nFigure 5.29 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cgFan\xe2\x80\x9d Engine Walk Around\nTable 5.13 \xe2\x80\x93 gFan Engine Description\nPropulsion system wt\nFan diameter\nLength\nPerformance\nSLS\nRolling takeoff\nTop-of-climb\nCruise\nEmissions\n\n6411\n70\n122\nThrust, lbf\n18,900\n14303\n4229\n4025\n-58%\n\nlbm\nin\nin, spinner to TRF\nSFC, lbm/lbf-hr\n0.256\n0.344\n0.534\n0.528\nrelative to CAEP/6\n\nProjected Technologies\nAdvanced 3-D aero composite fan\nUltra-high PR compressor\nAdvanced low-emissions combustor\nIntegrated thrust reverser/variable fan nozzle\nCMC turbine blades/vanes\nNext-gen component aero technology\nNext-gen nacelle technology\nImproved shaft material\nAcoustics technology suite\nHigh DN bearings, high speed/temperature seals\nTiAl materials & process technology\n\n71\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n5.5 \xe2\x80\x93 765-095 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR High (2030 Advanced Strut Braced High Span)\nThe SUGAR High configuration is a high span strut-braced wing concept that is tailored toward\nreducing fuel burn and noise via the aerodynamic benefits of high span.\n5.5.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Configuration Layout\nThe 765-095 configuration is a high wing airplane with turbofan engines mounted on pylons\nbelow the wing and a T-tail layout.

The wing was analyzed using station based analyses\nwhere the bending material was sized using empirical data, assuming that the strut reacted all\noutboard shear. Due to the inherent low bending and torsional resistance properties of this wing,\nan analysis was performed to account for aeroelastic effects. As a surrogate to more rigorous and\ncostly analyses, a tip rotation constraint was imposed to assess the torsional penalty incurred by\nthe bending material. The high weight of this wing is primarily due to the bending material\nthickness relative to the available box depth, even after including advanced aeroelastic load\nrelief. The standard methods used to estimate the wing weight are not considered adequate to\naccount for all of the advanced technologies. Therefore, there is high wing weight uncertainty\nand significant, although unproven, potential for weight reduction.\nFurther analysis using simple spreadsheet methods was done to explore potential weight\nreductions, as summarized in Figure 5.38. A non-optimized planform and the need for increased\ntorsional rigidity were major contributors to the high wing weight of the point design\nconfiguration. With the goal of reducing this, parametric variations were made to the simple\nanalysis model. Provisions were made to preserve the same stiffness while reducing structural\nmaterial. The thickness of the wing was increased slightly; resulting in greater stiffness over the\n78\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nentire wing. The planform was modified to reduce taper inboard of the strut, which increased the\nchord at the strut-to-wing intersection. This allowed the strut to have greater leverage in resisting\ntwist at the strut-to-wing intersection. These changes might allow the wing cover panels to be\nsized almost entirely by bending loads alone, with just a small increment added to meet the\ntorsion requirement. The reduced stresses, which would result in lower skin thicknesses, would\nallow the N+3 weight reduction factors to be applied. The total benefit of these changes, when\nincorporated, could result in up to 20,000 lbs of weight savings (Figure 5.38).

The overall engine design very similar to the gFan reference engine,\nbut incorporates a variety of advanced technologies above and beyond those in the gFan design.\nThus, the architectural concept is again a 2-spool separate flow turbofan but with a 59 OPR and\n13 BPR (at top of climb). The difference in OPR between the gFan and gFan+ is primarily due to\nthe lower FPR employed on the gFan+, which in turn leads to a slightly lower OPR for the same\nbasic booster and compressor design. The difference in OPR is more than made up for in the\nimproved propulsive efficiency and higher bypass ratio that ensue with the lower FPR. This\nengine also features relatively low hot section temperatures and makes extensive use of advanced\nCMCs.\nLike the gFan, this engine design is compatible with the aggressive emissions goals by virtue of\nthe relatively low hot section temperatures and an advanced low emissions combustor design.\nThe combustor is a \xe2\x80\x9cNGEN+ TAPS\xe2\x80\x9d design that is similar to the gFan engine but with additional\nmixing effectiveness improvements and other features to improve NOx and particulate emissions\nlevels. This engine is also more compatible with the very aggressive noise goals in that it\nfeatures a conventional shrouded fan/nacelle that provides good inherent shielding and also has a\nsuite of advanced acoustics technologies for lowest possible noise. Finally, this engine design\nfeatures an advanced nacelle design to minimize nacelle drag associated with low FPRs and\nlarger fan diameters.

In addition to the engine\npackage itself the airplane has modular batteries fitted beneath the fuselage on centerline. The\nconfiguration also permits batteries to be mounted in wing pods instead of the body. The\nfuselage mount accommodates the battery volume and hard point structure better while the wing\nwhile pod mounts may benefit from flutter relief, spanload, and ground servicing. The mounting\narrangements have not been traded. A three view drawing of the configuration is shown in Figure\n5.40.\nThe fuselage and LOPA are nominally the same as that of the 765-093 configuration (SUGAR\nFree). The LOPA can be seen in Figure 5.13.\n\n82\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nFigure 5.40 \xe2\x80\x93 765-096 3-View Drawing\n\n83\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n5.6.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Aerodynamic Buildup\nThe 765-096 aerodynamic buildup is the same as SUGAR High (765-095) (Section 1.1.1) with a\n2.5 count parasite drag increase (applied with the performance tools) to account for the battery\nfairing. Only the battery fairing is different from the SUGAR High\xe2\x80\x99s outer mold line (OML). No\nnew polars were generated for this configuration. The drag increase reduces the maximum M *\nL/D from 19.22 to 19.05 for the turbofan installation.\n5.6.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Mass Properties\nThe group weights statements for SUGAR Volt were the same as SUGAR High with a few\nexceptions. The engine weight was increased 9,522 pounds to account for the difference between\nthe gFan+ and hFan. Battery weight was added dependent on the sizing outputs. The capability\nto carry batteries was accompanied by an estimated 6,000 pound weight increase for mounting\nand wiring. The data represented for the SUGAR Volt include a lightweight wing consistent with\na 15,000 pound weight reduction applied as a fixed increment during sizing. This weight\nreduction was applied with the assumption that three quarters of the total opportunity will be\nattainable from SUGAR High (765-095) discussed in Section 5.5.3.\nIt should be noted that the SUGAR Volt propulsion system could also be integrated on the\nRefined SUGAR or SUGAR Ray. Most of the benefit obtained by the SUGAR Volt concept\nwould be available on the other concepts in the event the wing weight reduction goals are not\nmet. It is recommended the installation be studied on other platforms since configurations with\nlower L/D will have larger performance decrements due to the increased propulsion system and\nbattery weights.\n5.6.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Engine Data \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9ce-f-hFan\xe2\x80\x9d Engines\nSeveral engine designs were developed for consideration on the SUGAR Volt vehicle platform.\nThese were given the informal designations \xe2\x80\x9ceFan\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cfFan\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9chFan\xe2\x80\x9d. The eFan is an allelectric propulsor basically consisting of an electric motor coupled to a fan via a gearbox. The\nfFan is a gas turbine-fuel cell hybrid engine concept utilizing the gas turbine core to produce the\npower required for takeoff and climb, but relying mainly on the fuel cell system to provide cruise\nelectric power to a motor/gearbox attached to the LP spool. The hFan is a gas turbine-electric\nhybrid that has both a gas turbine and an electric motor attached to the LP spool such that it can\nrun on a combination of jet fuel and battery power. This section describes each of these concepts\nin further detail.\n\xe2\x80\x9ceFan\xe2\x80\x9d Propulsor:\nThe \xe2\x80\x9ceFan\xe2\x80\x9d propulsion system is effectively an advanced fan coupled to a lightweight, high\npower motor via a gearbox. The electric power required to drive the motor is assumed to come\nfrom an external source (batteries). The propulsion system is contained in a nacelle and lends\nitself to a variety of configurations, including distributed propulsion. The engine as sized for this\napplication is intended to be one of two engines mounted on the vehicle but the basic design\ncould easily be scaled down to a size appropriate for a plurality of distributed propulsors.\nKey dimensions, weight and performance figures for the eFan propulsor are provided in Table\n5.17. This propulsion system is surprisingly lightweight for its size, and this is aided by the fact\nthat large portions of the nacelle and structure can be fabricated from composites. It should be\nnoted, however, that the eFan geometry is not designed to the same level of fidelity as the gas\n84\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nturbine-based counterparts, simply because the database and tool set is much more limited for\nthis type of engine. The weight estimate must therefore be recognized as having significantly\nwider error bands than the comparable gas turbine concept. Also, note that the engine is designed\nfor a much higher thrust than the competing gas turbine concepts due to the mass of the battery\nrequired for an all-electric airplane to make the required mission range. This in turn makes the\nabsolute weight of the eFan propulsor higher than the competing gas turbine concept.\nTable 5.17 \xe2\x80\x93 eFan Key Weight, Dimensions, Performance, and Technologies\nPropulsion system wt\nFan diameter\nLength\nPerformance\nSLS\nRolling takeoff\nTop-of-climb\nCruise\nEmissions\n\n~7000\n90\n~105\n\nlbm\nin\nin, spinner to TRF\n\nThrust, lbf\n25500\n18258\n4732\n3333\n\nElec.

This is intended to take advantage of the strengths of\neach subsystem while mitigating the weaknesses. Specifically, use of the gas turbine to produce\nthe high horsepower requirements at takeoff and climb takes advantage of the inherently high\npower/weight of gas turbines while use of the fuel cell-electric subsystem for cruise takes\nadvantage of the high theoretical thermal efficiency of the fuel cell system while minimizing the\nphysical size and weight of the fuel cell.\nThe general arrangement of the fFan propulsion system is shown in Figure 5.41. The nacelle\ncontains the gas turbine propulsor, an electric motor, gearbox, and the fan. The gas turbine\nportion of the propulsor consists of a single spool unit connected to the main fan via a gearbox.\nThis gas turbine core is designed to be compatible with the RPM requirement needed for an\nefficient, lightweight electric motor. The single spool arrangement provides relative simplicity\nand the modest pressure ratio and temperatures employed in the gas turbine portion of the unit\nare conducive to low cost and very good emissions characteristics. The principal disadvantage of\nthis arrangement is the need for a high power gearbox to connect the fan and core shafts.\nAlternate 2-spool arrangements are possible, but the electric motor will still require a gearbox in\norder to minimize motor size and weight.\nThe fuel cell itself consists of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack fed by pressurized air bled\nfrom the gas turbine subsystem when in cruising flight. The solid oxide fuel cell was chosen\n85\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nprimarily because it offers the possibility of on-cell fuel reform of Jet-A type fuels (a\nfundamental assumption of this study was that the propulsion system had to use Jet-A fuel).\nFurther, the SOFC offers the possibility of a self-cooled system and its inlet/discharge\ntemperatures are quite compatible with the gas turbine.\nThe relatively low power/weight of projected fuel cell systems as well as their physical bulk\n(volume/power) makes them too large to fit inside the propulsion nacelle for the configuration\nstudied. Thus, the fuel cell itself is presumed to be located outside the propulsion nacelle\n(presumably in the fuselage). The air supplied to the fuel cell is taken from compressor discharge\nand is collected in a volute as shown in the figure. The effluent discharged from the fuel cell is\npassed back into the gas turbine through the combustor and subsequently through the turbine.\nNote that the provision of a variable bleed system to supply the necessary cruise flow to the fuel\ncells while maintaining acceptable gas turbine performance is non-trivial and requires the use of\ninnovative features in the gas turbine portion of the engine. Also, the reintroduction of the fuel\ncell effluent back into the combustor is a challenge, as the available pressure drop across the fuel\ncell system will be limited to something on the order of 5%. It is unclear at this point what\nimpact the reintroduction of fuel cell effluent into the combustor would have on the emissions\nlevels of the gas turbine portion of the system and this is an area that would require further study.\nIt became evident relatively early in the course of developing the fFan propulsion concept design\nthat a fuel cell-based propulsion system would face numerous challenges relative to the\nincumbent gas turbine-based system. Further, the experience base and tools available to aid in\nthe design are in a relatively primitive state in comparison to the gas turbine knowledge base.\nThus, this design was not developed to the level of detail that the other engines were. Engine\nperformance was only roughly estimated for cruise and takeoff, and no detailed performance\nmodel is yet available.

The hFan also features a conventional fan and nacelle arrangement\nfor lowest possible noise, as shown in Figure 5.42. The hFan and gFan+ engines share a common\ncore design with only minor differences between the two cores. However, the LP spools are\nconsiderably different. Specifically, the hFan engine is designed to the same FPR as the gFan+\nbut with a higher thrust level (required to cope with the added weight of the batteries needed to\npower the electric subsystem). The additional power required to drive the larger hFan fan is\nderived from the electric subsystem, which consists of an electric motor mounted inside the core\nexhaust nozzle and attached to the LP spool via a gearbox.\nThe hybrid electric system offers considerable flexibility to utilize gas turbine versus battery for\nvarious missions. In general, the gas turbine is used for long range cruise while the electric motor\nis used for short range cruise. This enables dramatic reductions in mission fuel burn for short\nrange missions. The electric motor and gearbox are sized to 5500 HP output. This is sufficient to\nmake adequate top-of-climb thrust in electric mode but is not adequate to make full thrust at\ntakeoff and climb (the fan power input requirement at takeoff is on the order of 20,000 HP).\nThus, the gas turbine is always needed for the low altitude portions of the mission.\nA further consideration in the design of this engine is the attainment of top-of-climb thrust. The\noriginal requirements for this engine design specified that the engine should be able to make full\ntop-of-climb thrust in either electric or gas turbine modes. However, when in electric mode, the\nloss of the thrust from the core nozzle implies that some other means would be required to make\nup the difference (such as increased electric power to the fan or oversizing the fan to regain the\nadditional thrust). However, this may be a heavier solution because it increases the electric\nhorsepower requirement and may compromise the design of the fan. Therefore, the thrust\nrequirements were modified such that the top-of-climb thrust available in electric mode is\n\n87\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nsomewhat less than that available in combined mode. As a result, the full top-of-climb thrust can\nonly be made in combined mode using both the gas turbine and the electric subsystems.\nSpecifically, if the gas turbine core is operating at full power output at the top-of-climb\ncondition, an additional 1275 HP motor power input to the LP spool is required to reach full\nthrust. This translates into an electrical power input of 1363 HP (1.01 MW).\nThis arrangement yields a good compromise between providing maximum capability to provide\nmission thrust via the electric subsystem while minimizing the required motor size and power\noutput. General weight, dimension and performance characteristics for the hFan engine are\nshown in Table 5.19. This table also shows the suite of technologies envisioned for this engine.\nThese technologies include all those applicable to the gFan+ propulsion system as well as many\nof the eFan electric power technologies. A final technology unique to this engine is the use of a\nvariable core nozzle that is independent from the variable fan nozzle. This is needed to\ncompensate to the speed-speed shift and accompanying booster operating line migration induced\nby modulation of the electric motor power input to the LP spool during the operating mode shifts\nbetween gas turbine, hybrid, and electric modes.\nAdvanced Composite Fan\n1.35 PR, 89.4\xe2\x80\x9d fan\nAdvanced 3-D aero design\nSculpted features, low noise\nThin, durable edges\n\n4-Stage Booster\n\nUltra-high PR core compressor\n59 OPR, 9 stages\nActive clearance control\nHPT\n2-Stage\nCMC nozzles + blades\nNext-gen ceramic\nActive purge control\nNext-gen disk material\nVariable core nozzle\n\nAdvanced nacelle\nHighly integrated\nMinimum OD\nUnitized composite\nAdvanced acoustic features\n\nAdvanced\ncombustor\nIntegrated thrust reverser/VFN\nHighly variable fan nozzle\n\nAdvanced Motor & Gearbox\n5500 HP power output\nAdvanced gear box\nLPT\n8-Stage\nHighly loaded stages\nCMC blades/vanes (weight)\n\nFigure 5.42 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9chFan\xe2\x80\x9d Engine Walk Around\n\n88\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nTable 5.19 \xe2\x80\x93 hFan Key Weight, Geometry, Performance, and Technologies\nPropulsion system wt\nFan diameter\nLength\n\n10475\n89\n156\n\nPerformance\nThrust, lbf\nSLS (GT mode)\n18800\nRolling tkoff (GT mode)\n13385\nTop-of-clmb (hybrid md)\n4364\nCruise (typ. hybrid mode)\n3344\nEmissions\n\nlbm\nin\nin, spinner to motor\nSFC, lbm/lbf-hr\n0.211\n0.301\n0.372 + 1363 HP in\n0.341 + 1363 HP in\n\n-72% to -100% relative to CAEP/6\n\nProjected Technologies\nAdvanced 3-D aero composite fan\nUltra-high PR compressor\nAdvanced low-emissions combustor\nIntegrated thrust reverser/variable fan nozzle\nNext-gen CMC HPT vanes, blades, and shrouds\nNext-gen component aero technology\nNext-gen nacelle technology\nImproved shaft material\nAcoustics technology suite\nHigh DN bearings, high speed/temperature seals\nTiAl materials & process technology\nAdvanced hot section disk material\nActive purge control\nAdvanced CMC blade and vane features\nClosed-loop, fast-response turbine ACC\nAdvanced high efficiency gearbox\nHigh-efficiency lightweight motor controller\nAdvanced lightweight high efficiency motor\nAdvanced battery technology (booked w/ airframe techs)\nLightweight, low loss radiators and surface coolers\n\n5.7\xe2\x80\x93 765-097 - SUGAR Ray (2030 Advanced Low Noise Hybrid Wing Body)\nThe SUGAR Ray configuration is an advanced HWB concept with a technology suite similar to\nthe SUGAR High.\n5.7.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Configuration Layout\nThe 765-097 configuration is a semi-high wing blended body consisting of a center body, a\ntransition region and an outboard wing.

For\na definition of the payload-range requirements please reference Table 2.2 and Figure 5.1.\n6.1.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Performance Analysis Tools\nThe Boeing Mission Analysis Program (BMAP) is the principal tool used by Boeing\nCommercial Airplanes (BCA) to calculate mission performance such as payload, range, or fuel\nburn. It can analyze missions of varying complexity and has been validated to actual airplane\nperformance. It has the capability to model complex tracks with enroute and alternate waypoints\nand complex profiles with multiple cruise segments including step and cruise climbs. It will\ncalculate airplane performance including redispatch, through-stop, radius, and extended-range\ntwin-engine operations (ETOPS) capability.\nUse of the Low Speed Performance System (LSPS) provides field length analysis. LSPS can\ncalculate takeoff performance at any specified atmospheric condition (altitude and temperature\nwithin its atmospheric model) and includes One Engine Inoperative (OEI) in its calculations.\nLike BMAP, it is calibrated to existing commercial airplanes.\nVehicle performance and sizing is performed with Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s Aircraft Design Navigator (ADNav)\nwhich encapsulates both mission performance (BMAP) and airfield performance calculations\n(LSPS). It provides the capability to scale engine thrust and wing area and provides the ability to\nsize airplanes to their optimum sizes given a set of constraints (such as TOFL, ICAC, time and\ndistance to climb, etc). It also provides some data visualization tools.\nThe sizing process is illustrated in Figure 6.1\nRequired Inputs\nAirplane Weight Data\n- Basic OEW\n- Sizing Data\n- f (Sw, TOGW, Fn)\n\nAirplane Drag Data\n- Basic Polar\n- CDPmin Buildup\n- Takeoff Polars\n- Stall Lift Coefficients\n\nAirplane Propulsion Data\n- Takeoff Thrust / Fuel Flow\n- Cruise Thrust / Fuel Flow\n- Idle thrust / Fuel Flow\n\nBasic Airplane Performance\n- Mission Performance\n- Takeoff Field Length\n\nSize Airplane (Wing and Engine) to\nMeet Performance Requirements\n- Design Range\n- Climb Performance\n- Takeoff Field Length\n\nFigure 6.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Airplane Sizing Using ADNav\n\n98\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nIt should be noted that BCA uses reference Wimpress area as the reference area for nondimensional quantities.\n6.1.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Mission Profiles\nThe future scenario (discussed in Section 2.0) was used to generate the desired vehicle\ncharacteristics (Table 2.2). These characteristics, along with the payload range requirements\n(discussed in Section 5.1) and the mission profiles outlined in this section, are used for vehicle\nsizing.\nFuture Ground and Air Traffic Management systems will allow for reduced mission fuel burn,\nemissions, and noise. The current environment introduces delays and mission inefficiencies into\nthe system, which in the future can be eliminated. In addition, future predictive technologies and\nreal-time mission optimization will allow for a higher confidence level in completing the mission\nas planned.\nMission Profiles have been developed to approximate the difference between an airplane\noperating in the current environment, versus an airplane operating in the future environment.\nDifferences between the two profiles are shown in Table 6.1.\nA schematic of the 2008 Reference Mission Profile is shown in Figure 6.2, and a schematic of\nthe 2030 Mission Profile is shown in Figure 6.3. The sizing payload is the low density seats (dual\nclass) at 200 pounds per passenger at the maximum range specified in Table 2.2 and Figure 5.1.\nThe still air range of Figure 6.2 is five percent longer than the maximum range shown in Table\n2.2 while in Figure 6.3 they are the same.\n\n99\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nTable 6.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Mission Changes due to NextGen ATM\n\nTaxi Out\n\nClimb\n\nCruise\n\nDescent\n\nTaxi In\n\nFlight Fuel Allowance\n\nClimb\n\nDescent\n\nHold\n\n2008 Mission Profile\nFigure 6.2\nMission\nAirport congestion and queues at\nrunways increase airplane idle time\nwhile waiting to takeoff\nAir Traffic Management requires airplane\nto climb at or below 250 kts below\n10,000 ft altitude.

A\ngeneric airport, similar to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, was selected. This enables\nmodel calibration to actual Cleveland airport noise data, but allows additional flexibility in\nestablishing the airport boundaries and defining the airport scenarios. Cleveland is an airport that\nhas a recent Noise Exposure Map (NEM) approved by FAA and this airport has an appropriate\nfleet mix that contains a significant number of medium sized aircraft that are being evaluated in\nthe SUGAR study. The future scenario supplies the fleet mix and generation mix for today, 2030,\nand in the future when N+3 aircraft will be present in large numbers.\nNoise Power Distance (NPD) information for the current aircraft in the fleet mix, the expected\nfleet mix in 2030, 2055, and an all N+3 technology aircraft fleet was generated. An Integrated\nNoise Model (INM) was then used to generate 55, 60, and 65 DNL contours and compare the\ncontours for the different fleet scenarios. Sensitivities to fleet size and N+3 fleet replacement\npercentage were also generated.\nInitial calculations were made using 2008 Cleveland noise data, and the model has been\ncalibrated to match these results (Figure 6.4). The noise performance of all five concept aircraft\nwas estimated to allow a comparison between the concepts. The noise signature for the SUGAR\nRay low noise configuration, and how it performs relative to the NASA noise goals was studied\nin detail.\n\nFigure 6.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Noise Methods Calibrated to Airport Data\n\n102\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n6.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Vehicle Performance and Sizing\n765-093 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR Free:\nThe reference 2008 performance level airplane is known as \xe2\x80\x9cSUGAR Free\xe2\x80\x9d. SUGAR Free was\nsized to provide a 3,500 nmi range with 154 passengers @ 200 lb / passenger dual-class payload\n(design range). SUGAR Free performance is quoted using the 2008 Reference Mission Profile.\nThe SUGAR Free sizing chart is shown in Figure 6.5. The chart represents a matrix of airplane\nperformance variation as airplane wing area and engine scale vary, while design range is held\nconstant. The x-axis is wing area variation, and the y-axis is engine scale variation. Plotted on\nthe chart are contour lines of constant takeoff field length, distance to altitude, approach speed,\nOperational Empty Weight (OEW), and block fuel / seat on a 500 nmi mission. Constraint lines\nof takeoff field length ~ 8,200 ft at Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW), at Sea Level, on an 86\xc2\xb0\nday, and a distance to climb to 35,000 ft after a takeoff at Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW)\non a Standard Day are also plotted in red. These two constraints were chosen as representative of\nthe performance level of airplanes in service today, and the intersection of those two constraints\nwas used as the wing and thrust sizing point for SUGAR Free. All other performance levels, as\nshown in Table 6.2, were a fallout from these two constraints.\n\nFigure 6.5 \xe2\x80\x93 765-093 Sizing\n\n103\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nTable 6.2 \xe2\x80\x93 765-093 - SUGAR Baseline Sizing\nMODEL\nSizing Level\n\nSUGAR Free\n154 / Dual\n\nPASSENGERS / CLASS\nMAX TAKEOFF WEIGHT\nMAX LANDING WEIGHT\nMAX ZERO FUEL WEIGHT\nOPERATING EMPTY WEIGHT\nFUEL CAPACITY REQ\nENGINE MODEL\nFAN DIAMETER\nBOEING EQUIVLENT THRUST (BET)\nWING AREA / SPAN\nASPECT RATIO (EFFECTIVE)\nOPTIMUM CL\nCRUISE L/D @ OPT CL\nDESIGN MISSION RANGE\nPERFORMANCE CRUISE MACH\nLONG RANGE CRUISE MACH (LRC)\nTHRUST ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nTIME / DIST (MTOW, 35k FT, ISA)\nOPTIMUM ALTITUDE (MTOW, ISA)\nBUFFET ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nTOFL (MTOW, SEA LEVEL, 86 DEG F)\nAPPROACH SPEED (MLW)\nBLOCK FUEL / SEAT (900 NMI)\n\nLB\nLB\nLB\nLB\nUSG\n\n184,800\n151,000\n142,000\n96,000\n9,710\n\nIN\nLB\n\nScaled CFM56-7B27\n62\n28,200\n\nFT2 / FT\n\n1429 / 122\n10.41\n0.583\n18.068\n\nNMI\nFT\nMIN / NMI\nFT\nFT\nFT\nKT\n\n3,500\n0.785\n0.785\n37,200\n23 / 148\n35,000\n36,200\n8,190\n126\n\nLB\n\n92.35\n\nA trade was done to quantify the block fuel benefit of changing from the 2008 Reference\nMission Profile to the 2030 Mission profile using SUGAR Free as the base airplane. The trade\nwas done by changing the mission profile in BMAP, rerunning the performance, and resizing the\nairplane.

Designing an\nairplane to be able to utilize smaller metroplex airports, i.e. ones with shorter field lengths,\nwould result in an airplane which required more thrust and wing area, and hence pay a penalty in\nblock fuel / seat. This penalty is quantified in Table 6.7. Operationally, an airplane can takeoff\nfrom smaller fields, as noted by quoting the 900 nmi takeoff weight mission takeoff field length\nwithout paying this penalty, but would need to reduce payload, or range, or both. Alternately, the\nhigh lift system can be made more powerful to reduce field lengths, with potentially less fuel\nburn penalty, but this option has not been explored in this study.\n\n108\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nTable 6.7 \xe2\x80\x93 795-094 \xe2\x80\x93 Refined SUGAR Takeoff Field Length Trade\nMODEL\nSizing Level\n\n+500 ft\n\nENGINE MODEL\nFAN DIAMETER\nBOEING EQUIVLENT THRUST (BET)\nWING AREA / SPAN\nASPECT RATIO (EFFECTIVE)\nOPTIMUM CL\nCRUISE L/D @ OPT CL\nDESIGN MISSION RANGE\nPERFORMANCE CRUISE MACH\nLONG RANGE CRUISE MACH (LRC)\nTHRUST ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nTIME / DIST (MTOW, 35k FT, ISA)\nOPTIMUM ALTITUDE (MTOW, ISA)\nBUFFET ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nTOFL (MTOW, SEA LEVEL, 86 DEG F)\nTOFL (900 NMI MISS, SEA LEVEL, 86 DEG F)\nAPPROACH SPEED (MLW)\nBLOCK FUEL / SEAT (900 NMI)\n\n-500 ft\n\n-1,000 ft\n\n154 / Dual\n\n154 / Dual\n\n154 / Dual\n\n154 / Dual\n\nLB\nLB\nLB\nLB\nUSG\n\n138,400\n130,800\n122,800\n76,800\n5,457\n\n139,700\n131,800\n123,800\n77,800\n5,512\n\n141,200\n132,900\n124,900\n78,900\n5,571\n\n142,900\n134,300\n126,300\n80,300\n5,615\n\nIN\nLB\n\nScaled gFan\n65\n15,100\n\nScaled gFan\n66\n15,700\n\nScaled gFan\n68\n16,300\n\nScaled gFan\n69\n16,700\n\nFT2 / FT\n\n1400 / 128\n11.63\n0.660\n21.874\n\n1440 / 129\n11.63\n0.654\n21.981\n\n1490 / 132\n11.63\n0.652\n22.109\n\n1580 / 136\n11.63\n0.653\n22.374\n\nNMI\nFT\nMIN/ NMI\nFT\nFT\nFT\nFT\nKT\n\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n38,400\n30 / 189\n38,400\n45,100\n8,680\n5,790\n116\n\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n38,800\n29 / 182\n38,400\n45,200\n8,190\n5,510\n115\n\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n39,500\n28 / 177\n38,800\n45,700\n7,690\n5,240\n113\n\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n40,100\n29 / 168\n39,900\n46,800\n7,190\n4,940\n111\n\nLB\n\n50.84 (-1.3%)\n\n51.53 (Base)\n\n52.29 (+1.5%)\n\n52.97 (+2.8%)\n\nPASSENGERS / CLASS\nMAX TAKEOFF WEIGHT\nMAX LANDING WEIGHT\nMAX ZERO FUEL WEIGHT\nOPERATING EMPTY WEIGHT\nFUEL CAPACITY REQ\n\nBase TOFL\n\n765-095 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR High:\n\xe2\x80\x9cSUGAR High\xe2\x80\x9d, is a strut-braced, large span, high wing airplane configuration utilizing the\ngFan+ engine, and increased technology beyond the Refined SUGAR as defined in Section 4.0.\nSUGAR High was sized using the same process, mission profile, and performance requirements,\nas Refined SUGAR.

The General\nElectric hybrid engine is designated hFan. The airplane was sized such that on the design\nmission, while provisioning for batteries is included, no batteries are actually used in the\nmission. The lack of batteries for the design mission results in an airplane with a lower MTOW\nthan if batteries were used on that mission. As mission range is decreased, more and more\npotential weight is available for adding batteries and still remaining below MTOW for the\nmission. Table 6.12 shows the performance level of the SUGAR Volt airplane.

As horsepower applied to the engine is increased, maximum thrust is increased. There is\nthen the potential to use increased levels of horsepower during periods of high thrust utilization,\ne.g. takeoff and climb, and less during periods of low thrust required, e.g. cruise and descent.\nTable 6.14 shows the results of one attempt at doing that. The airplane and engine were resized\nusing 1,250 horsepower for just the takeoff and climb portion of the design mission. Since the\nengine has more thrust capability during takeoff and climb when horsepower is applied, and the\nengines are sized for climb and cruise thrust, engine scale for the airplane was reduced, as shown\nin the 1,250 hp column airplane. While the airplane sizes to be smaller and lighter, when the\nairplane reaches its cruise altitude, and battery power is exhausted, the airplane is no longer\ncapable of remaining at the altitude achievable during climb, if that altitude is at or above the\noptimum altitude. Cruise thrust available without the added horsepower boost from the electric\nmotor is not enough to sustain the airplane at its optimum altitude as shown by the cruise thrust\nInitial Cruise Altitude Capability (ICAC) being over 1,000 ft below the airplane optimum\naltitude.\n\n114\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nTable 6.14 \xe2\x80\x93 765-096 Power Trade for Core Sizing\nMODEL\nSizing Level\n\nNo Electric\nSystems\n\nENGINE MODEL\nFAN DIAMETER\nBOEING EQUIVLENT THRUST (BET)\nWING AREA / SPAN\nASPECT RATIO (EFFECTIVE)\nOPTIMUM CL\nCRUISE L/D @ OPT CL\nDESIGN MISSION RANGE\nPERFORMANCE CRUISE MACH\nLONG RANGE CRUISE MACH (LRC)\nCLIMB THRUST ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nCRUISE THRUST ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nTIME / DIST (MTOW, 35k FT, ISA)\nOPTIMUM ALTITUDE (MTOW, ISA)\nBUFFET ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nTOFL (MTOW, SEA LEVEL, 86 DEG F)\nAPPROACH SPEED (MLW)\nBLOCK FUEL / SEAT (900 NMI)\n\n1,250 hp\n1,800 lb Battery\n\n154 / Dual\n\n154 / Dual\n\n154 / Dual\n\nLB\nLB\nLB\nLB\nUSG\n\n140,100\n136,000\n128,000\n82,000\n4,928\n\n154,900\n148,600\n140,600\n94,600\n5,250\n\n152,500\n148,300\n140,300\n94,300\n4,930\n\nIN\nLB\n\nScaled gFan+\n78\n16,200\n\nScaled hFan\n80\n17,300\n\nScaled hFan\n73\n14,300\n\nFT2 / FT\n\n1292 / 187\n26.94\n0.865\n24.161\n\n1498 / 201\n26.94\n0.831\n24.992\n\n1592 / 207\n26.94\n0.837\n25.751\n\nNMI\nFT\nFT\nMIN / NMI\nFT\nFT\nFT\nKT\n\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n42,900\n44,800\n28 / 181\n41,900\n42,900\n8,150\n120\n\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n42,800\n44,900\n29 / 178\n42,000\n43,900\n8,180\n116\n\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n45,200\n42,600\n29 / 182\n43,700\n45,400\n8,190\n113\n\nLB\n\n46.78 (Base)\n\n50.64 (+8.25%)\n\n45.67 (-2.4%)\n\nPASSENGERS / CLASS\nMAX TAKEOFF WEIGHT\nMAX LANDING WEIGHT\nMAX ZERO FUEL WEIGHT\nOPERATING EMPTY WEIGHT\nFUEL CAPACITY REQ\n\nSUGAR Volt\n0 lb Battery\n\nBecause the amount of batteries the airplane can carry on shorter range missions is directly\nproportional to the difference between the airplane\xe2\x80\x99s MTOW and Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW =\nOperational Empty Weight + Payload Weight), the airplane can carry more batteries, i.e.\ndecrease fuel burn, by increasing MTOW. This is exactly the opposite effect of fuel only\nairplanes. Increasing the difference between MTOW and ZFW is effectively increasing the\ndesign range of the airplane. This trend is illustrated in Table 6.15. As design range is increased,\nthe airplane becomes bigger and heavier, but because the airplane can carry more batteries on a\n900 nmi mission and utilize that extra power instead of burning fuel, the actual fuel burn on that\nmission decreases. If the airplane is sized large enough to carry enough batteries, the fuel burn\ncan reach the NASA goal of a 70% block fuel reduction.\n\n115\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nTable 6.15 \xe2\x80\x93 765-096 MTOW Trade\nMODEL\nSizing Level\n\nSUGAR Free\n\nSUGAR Volt\n\nSUGAR VOLT\nIncrease MTOW\n\nSUGAR VOLT\nIncrease MTOW\n\n154 / Dual\n\n154 / Dual\n\n154 / Dual\n\n154 / Dual\n\nLB\nLB\nLB\nLB\nUSG\n\n184,800\n151,000\n142,000\n96,000\n9,710\n\n154,900\n148,600\n140,600\n94,600\n5,250\n\n163,100\n152,300\n144,300\n98,300\n5,948\n\n179,700\n159,600\n151,600\n105,600\n7,373\n\nIN\nLB\n\nScaled CFM56-7B27\n62\n28,200\n\nScaled hFan\n80\n17,300\n\nScaled hFan\n82\n18,000\n\nScaled hFan\n86\n23,600\n\nFT2 / FT\n\n1429 / 122\n10.41\n0.583\n18.068\n\n1498 / 201\n26.94\n0.831\n24.992\n\n1597 / 207\n26.94\n0.827\n25.365\n\n1769 / 218\n26.94\n0.826\n25.894\n\nNMI\nFT\nMIN / NMI\nFT\nFT\nFT\nKT\n\n3,500\n0.785\n0.785\n37,200\n23 / 148\n35,000\n36,200\n8,190\n126\n\n3,500\n0.70\n0.70\n42,800\n29 / 178\n42,000\n43,900\n8,180\n116\n\n4,000\n0.70\n0.70\n42,900\n29 / 181\n42,200\n44,200\n8,190\n114\n\n4,900\n0.70\n0.70\n43,100\n29 / 177\n42,300\n44,300\n8,200\n111\n\nLB\nLB\nLB\n\n0\n96,000\n92.35 (Base)\n\n20,900\n116,500\n33.83 (-63.4%)\n\n25,200\n123,500\n31.54 (-65.8%)\n\n35,500\n141,100\n26.23 (-71.6%)\n\nPASSENGERS / CLASS\nMAX TAKEOFF WEIGHT\nMAX LANDING WEIGHT\nMAX ZERO FUEL WEIGHT\nOPERATING EMPTY WEIGHT\nFUEL CAPACITY REQ\nENGINE MODEL\nFAN DIAMETER\nBOEING EQUIVLENT THRUST (BET)\nWING AREA / SPAN\nASPECT RATIO (EFFECTIVE)\nOPTIMUM CL\nCRUISE L/D @ OPT CL\nDESIGN MISSION RANGE\nPERFORMANCE CRUISE MACH\nLONG RANGE CRUISE MACH (LRC)\nCLIMB THRUST ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nTIME / DIST (MTOW, 35k FT, ISA)\nOPTIMUM ALTITUDE (MTOW, ISA)\nBUFFET ICAC (MTOW, ISA)\nTOFL (MTOW, SEA LEVEL, 86 DEG F)\nAPPROACH SPEED (MLW)\nBATTERIES CARRIED (900 NMI)\nOPERATING EMPTY WEIGHT (900 NMI)\nBLOCK FUEL / SEAT (900 NMI)\n\nAnother possibility for exploiting the increased thrust capability of the hybrid engine is to use it\nto reduce TOFL. If the engine is sized using fuel only thrust capability to the TOFL requirement,\napplying horsepower to the engine will have the effect of reducing that TOFL. This effect is\nillustrated in Table 6.16. As more horsepower is applied, the TOFL of the airplane at MTOW,\nand on a 900 nmi mission, is significantly reduced. It was assumed takeoff thrust capability\nwould need to be available for 5 minutes, and the weight of the batteries carried is reflected in\nthe slight penalty in both design range and block fuel.\nTable 6.16 \xe2\x80\x93 765-096 TOFL Trade\nMODEL\nSizing Level\n\nSUGAR Volt\nBase\n\n1,250 hp\n\n2,500 hp\n\n3,750 hp\n\nMAX TAKEOFF WEIGHT\nBATTERY WEIGHT\nOPERATING EMPTY WEIGHT\n\nLB\nLB\nLB\n\n154,900\n0\n94,600\n\n154,900\n320\n94,600\n\n154,900\n530\n94,600\n\n154,900\n740\n94,600\n\nENGINE MODEL\nFAN DIAMETER\nBOEING EQUIVLENT THRUST (BET)\n\nIN\nLB\n\nScaled hFan\n80\n17,300\n\nScaled hFan\n80\n19,400\n\nScaled hFan\n80\n21,300\n\nScaled hFan\n80\n23,000\n\nDESIGN MISSION RANGE\nTOFL (MTOW, SEA LEVEL, 86 DEG F)\n\nNMI\nFT\n\n3,500\n8,180\n\n3,450\n6,800\n\n3,420\n6,040\n\n3,385\n5,600\n\nTAKEOFF WEIGHT REQUIRED (900 NMI)\nTOFL (900 NMI, SEA LEVEL, 86 DEG F)\nBLOCK FUEL / SEAT (900 NMI)\n\nLB\nFT\nLB\n\n136,500\n5,980\n50.64 (Base)\n\n136,800\n5,140\n50.71 (+0.1%)\n\n137,000\n4,740\n50.76 (+0.2%)\n\n137,200\n4,425\n50.81 (+0.3%)\n\nSimilar to the SUGAR High airplane, a trade was done to examine the effect of applying an\nOpen Fan engine to SUGAR Volt.

It also allowed for low level trade\nstudies to be performed that were calibrated to the higher level analyses. The data in this section\nis a result of these calibrated lower fidelity methods.\nContrails may contribute to global climate change and can be avoided by flying at altitudes that\nprevent their formation. An extreme solution is to restrict all air traffic to 27,000 feet which\nwould adversely affect vehicle performance. To quantify this, a Refined SUGAR configuration\nwas sized with both unrestricted and restricted initial cruise altitude allowing thrust, wing area,\nand aspect ratio to change.

The vehicle fuel burn will depend on what\nTOGW is selected and what level of battery technology is available. Figure 6.11 shows the\nvehicle\xe2\x80\x99s fuel burn and energy utilization sensitivity to TOGW and battery energy density. As\nTOGW is increased, more batteries are carried, which decreases fuel burn. What is not obvious is\nthat, above a critical battery energy density, the energy used starts to decrease also. If fuel burn\nminimization is the only metric and one does not care about wing span or vehicle TOGW,\nmaximizing TOGW results in the minimum fuel burn. There is a limit on how little fuel is\nburned that is caused by the operational restrictions placed on the engine.\nAs previously stated, the fuel burn is being measured for the average 900 nautical mile mission\nthat was an output from the future scenario. In order to verify that increasing TOGW and\nminimizing fuel burn for the 900 nautical mile mission was not increasing fleet fuel burn a\nweighted average was calculated based on projected Medium sized airplane frequencies verses\nrange. Figure 6.12 shows that after 220,000 pounds there is diminishing return from a fleet\nstandpoint.\n\n122\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n46\n\n50%\n50\n0\n\n44\n39\n\nBattery\nWh/kg\n\n32\n\nTOGW 163,100\n\n75\n0\n\n35\n\nScaled hFan,\n\n60%\n\n220,000\n\n30\n\n65%\n\n240,000\n\n28\n\nNASA Goal\n\n10\n00\n\nBlock Fuel Per Seat (900 NMI)\n\n37\n\n55%\n163,000\n180,000 TOGW\n200,000\n\n25\n23\n\n70%\n75%\n\n21\n\nScaled hFan,\n\n18\n\nTOGW 179,700\n\n80%\n\n16\n14\n\n85%\n\nPercent Fuel Burn Reduction\nPercent Fuen Burn Reduction\n\n42\n\n12\n90%\n\n9\n7\n\nFuel burn reduction reaches a limit\ndue to taxi and gas turbine operation\nassumptions\n\n5\n2\n\n95%\n100%\n170\n\n0\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n\n160\n\nMillions of BTU\'s (900 NMI)\n\nFigure 6.11 \xe2\x80\x93 SUGAR Volt Fuel Burn Opportunities\n\n35,000\n30,000\n25,000\n20,000\n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n2000\nRange (NM)\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n50%\n\n42\nBlock Fuel Per Seat (900 NMI)\n\n46\n\n55%\n60%\n\n37\n32\n\n160,000\n\n28\n\n180,000\n\n23\n\n65%\n\nTOGW\n\n70%\n75%\n\n200,000\n\n18\n\n00\n22 0,0\n\n750 Wh/kg\n\n14\n\n80%\n\n240,000\n\n85%\n\n9\n\n90%\n\n5\n\nPercent FuelBurn Reduction\n(900 NM)\n\nMission Frequency\n\n40,000\n\n95%\n\n0\n64%\n\n65%\n\n66%\n\n67%\n\n68%\n\n69%\n\n70%\n\n71%\n\n72%\n\n73%\n\n100%\n74%\n\nMission Frequency Weighted Fuel Burn Reduction\n\nFigure 6.12 \xe2\x80\x93 Medium Airplane Frequencies vs. Range and SUGAR Volt Fleet Fuel Burn\n\n123\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n6.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Evaluation of NASA Metrics\nThe following section contains charts that illustrate the range of the charted variable for each\nconfiguration that was generated with the low and high fidelity methods. These charts should\nNOT be interpreted as the minimum and maximum attainable values for the configuration. A\nnote on the right of each of the bars indicates which trade dominated the variation of the plotted\nvariable. For example for take-off field length (TOFL) one would expect to see TOFL on the\nright for all vehicles that have TOFL trades performed as that trade should dominate the range\nfor that variable. Also included on the chart is a grey dot that represents the baseline\nconfiguration shown in the summary tables from the sizing analysis.\n6.4.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Fuel Burned and Energy Consumed\nThe fuel burn for the five concepts at the average mission range of 900 nm was computed for a\nbase vehicle and trade studies were performed using high fidelity methods. The results of these\ntrades are illustrated in Figure 6.13. The only trade performed on SUGAR Free was for advanced\nair traffic management (ATM) and the size of the bar illustrates how powerful the ATM is at\nreducing fuel burn. Also of interest is the range of the metric for SUGAR High. Surprisingly\n20,000 pounds of OEW doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the fuel burn as much as one would expect. It does show\nthat the high span technology must be light in order to beat the Refined or SUPER Refined\nSUGAR. It does show that potential for the airplane to be better for this metric than the\nconventional arrangement.\nSUGAR Volt is the only configuration that is capable of meeting or exceeding the NASA 70%\nfuel burn reduction goal. This hinges on advanced energy densities for batteries.\nThe chart also shows carbon emissions since it is directly proportional to the fuel burned. The\ncarbon emissions shown are for JP based fuels and take no credit for biofuels.\n\n90\n\nATM\nTrade\n\n80\n\n40\n30\n\nOEW Trade\n\n50\n\nNASA Goal\n\nOEW Trade\n\n60\n\nFOM Trades\n\n70\n\nTOFL Trade\n\nFuel Burn (900 NMI) (lb / Seat)\nCarbon Emissions (900 NMI) (klb)\n\n315\n100\n\n20\n10\n0\n0\n\nSUGAR Free\nBase\n\nRefined SUGAR\n\nNominal Point Design\n\nSuper Refined\nSUGAR\n\nSUGAR High\n\nPoint Design Trade Range\n\nSUGAR Volt\n\nSUGAR Ray\n\nOpportunities Trade Range\n\nFigure 6.13 \xe2\x80\x93 Fuel Burn and Carbon Emissions\n\n124\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nThe 900 nautical mile mission was used for the fuel burn metric for SUGAR because it is\naverage mission projected for 2030.

The purpose was to constrain the efforts of the study to air vehicle design. Using these\nrules, an electric airplane would burn no fuel. However, this may not be the intent of the rules\noutlined by the NRA as electric commercial airliners may have been viewed as an impractical\nsolution. The total energy used by each configuration is shown in Figure 6.15.

For Metroplex capability, it was assumed that a TOFL of\n5,000 feet or better at the 900 nmi mission weight would be sufficient. Hence, TOFL was used as\na surrogate to Metroplex compatibility. However, with unfolded spans reaching into 200 feet it is\nobvious that more work needs to be completed prior to declaring these configurations\n\xe2\x80\x9cMetroplex Compatible\xe2\x80\x9d.\nOverall, achieving field lengths as low as 5,000 feet at the 900 nautical mile mission weight is\nnot difficult though only three vehicles were analyzed at that condition. SUGAR Volt is of\nparticular interest as it was found that the operator could choose the field length desired at the\ncost of efficiency. For a 900 nautical mile mission, the operator could choose to use JP fuel for\nthe entire cruise and climb, thus reducing takeoff weight, and batteries for a thrust augmentation\non takeoff. The engine has significantly more thrust when operated in the dual mode than with JP\nor batteries alone. That combined with wing areas sized for the long missions with heavy\nbatteries yields very high thrust-to-weight and low wing loadings.\n\n126\n\n10,000\n9,500\n\n7,000\n\nOEW Trade\n\nTOFL Trade\n\n7,500\n\nTOFL Trade\n\n8,000\n\nTOFL Trade\n\n8,500\n\nNo Trades\n\n9,000\n\nNo Trades\n\n900\nnmi\n\n6,000\n5,500\n5,000\n\n900 nmi\n\n6,500\n\n900\nnmi\n\nTOFL (3,500 NMI Mission unless noted)\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n4,500\n4,000\nSUGAR Free\nBase\n\nRefined SUGAR\n\nNominal Point Design\n\nSuper Refined\nSUGAR\n\nSUGAR High\n\nPoint Design Trade Range\n\nSUGAR Volt\n\nSUGAR Ray\n\nOpportunities Trade Range\n\nFigure 6.16 \xe2\x80\x93 Vehicle Field Length Capability\n\n6.4.3 \xe2\x80\x93 LTO NOx Emissions\nFigure 6.17 shows the results of the LTO NOx emissions.

The GE noise reduction technologies are shown in Section 7.3.5.\nThe following is a list of assumed airframe noise technologies:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAirframe weight reduction from improved structures/materials, propulsion, and systems \xe2\x80\x93\nreduces aircraft size, TOFL, and engine size\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nLightweight low speed high lift devices to reduce thrust required for cutback flyover and\napproach conditions\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAirframe noise reduction methods including wing planform (airfoil design), main gear\nfairings, lift & control surface treatments (sealing, etc.)\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nRear fan duct noise treatment methods\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nInlet noise shielding from top of wing mounted engines (SUGAR Ray)\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nRear jet and exhaust fan duct noise shielding from rear deck/platform for flyover and\napproach noise reduction and twin verticals for lateral noise reduction (need to assess\nnoise shielding increments) and exhaust nozzle designs for distributed jet noise source\nreduction from shielding (SUGAR Ray)\n\nThe configuration noise results are shown in Table 6.23. The Refined SUGAR with the gFan\nengine acoustic technologies is calculated to have a noise reduction of 16 dB relative to the\nSUGAR Free CFM-56 Baseline. Adding advanced gFan+ engine acoustics technologies yields\nan additional 6 dB reduction for the SUGAR High configuration. The additional shielding\n129\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nprovided by the HWB configuration, gives the SUGAR Ray an additional benefit of 15 dB. All\nof the quoted reductions are approximate. The noise build-ups are not necessarily as \xe2\x80\x9clinear\xe2\x80\x9d as\nwe have assumed, as some technologies may not work together in a simple additive manner. The\nSUGAR Volt, which essentially uses a gFan+ engine with an added electric motor, was not\nspecifically evaluated, because use of the electric system as part of the noise calculation\nprocedure was not investigated. However, since the electric system is inherently quieter than\nconventional propulsion, any electric system use would tend to reduce the overall noise. If the\nbest performing configuration, the SUGAR Ray (at -37 dB), is used, then the 55 DNL contour is\nat approximately 2.5 miles, which is 0.8 miles outside the 1.7 mile airport boundary with a 100%\nN+3 fleet (Figure 6.19). Additional noise reduction to achieve -45 dB, or a reduction in fleet size,\nis required to meet the 1.7 mile airport boundary. Both are required to meet the 1.0 mile airport\nboundary. Alternatively, significant aircraft and engine noise reduction (beyond -45 dB), would\nbe required to bring the 55 DNL boundary inside the 1.0 mile airport boundary for the projected\n2055 fleet size.\nTable 6.23 \xe2\x80\x93 Vehicle Noise Comparison\nRefined\nSUGAR\n\nSUGAR High\n\nSUGAR Volt\n\nSUGAR Ray\n\nScaled\nCFM56-7B27\n\nScaled gFan\n\nScaled gFan+\n\nScaled hFan\n\nScaled gFan+\n\n0\n\n-16\n\n-22\n\nBetter than -22\n\n-37\n\nMODEL\n\nSUGAR Free\n\nENGINE MODEL\ndB\n\nNOISE\n\nAssumes 100% N+3 Aircraft in 2055\nDistance to 55 DNL Contour (NMI)\n\n5.0\n4.5\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\nAssumed Airport\nBoundary\n\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-45\n\n-40\n\n-35\n\n-30\n\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\nN+3 Noise Reduction\n\nFigure 6.19 \xe2\x80\x93 Sensitivity of 55 DNL Distance to N+3 Noise Reduction\n\nLooking at the impact of other N+3 propulsion options is recommended.

At this workshop, the\nteam accelerated the generation of inputs and validated results to support the technology risk\nassessment and roadmapping process. The risk assessment results are documented here. This\ninformation was used as a starting point for the generation of the technology roadmaps.\n\n7.1 \xe2\x80\x93 Technology Ranking\nTechnology impacts were obtained through either the direct modeling of the technologies on the\nvehicles or sensitivity analysis of certain parameters which they affect. At the top level each\ntechnology is scored against how much improvement of each NASA goal it produces and then\nthese impacts are rolled up to a total value based on weightings for each of the goals. It should be\nnoted that these rankings do not capture the compounded effect of synergistic technologies, as\nthe sensitivity of each goal to each technology was evaluated independently. All the information\nwas compiled into a front end dashboard tool which allowed for dynamic tradeoffs to occur and\nbe visualized.\nThe dashboard allows for goal weighting tradeoffs to be made and the impacts on the technology\nranking to be assessed in real time. The layout shows several pieces of information which are\nhighlighted in Figure 7.2. The top left corner contains the concept selection and goal weightings\nwhere the user can determine which technologies to assess and how much priority to assign to\neach of the goals in the calculation of the overall score. The majority of the screen is dominated\nby the technology ranking itself where each tech is listed in order based on its impact to the\n\n133\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\ngoals. If a Technology is not applicable to the concept selected or has no impact on the goals\nthen it is hidden from view. Next to the rankings the graphs depict the overall score of the\ntechnologies based on the goal weightings as well as the individual goal contribution that each\nprovides. The plot in the lower left hand corner shows the risk of the technologies which appear\nin the ranking with the size of the bubble indicating how many technologies have the associated\nlikelihood and consequence value.\n\nFigure 7.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Technology Ranking Dashboard Layout\n\nThis dashboard was utilized to create the following technology ranking figures. For the purpose\nof the final report the technologies were ranked for each aircraft using a variety of weightings:\nequal weighting, fuel burn only, cruise emissions only, NOx only, and noise only (Figure 7.3 \xe2\x80\x93\nFigure 7.22).\nA wide range of technologies contribute to the fuel burn reduction goal. The highest ranking fuel\nburn technologies are the Next Generation Air Traffic Management System, laminar flow, and\nengine technologies. However, 10-15 technologies make significant contributions. For cruise\ngreenhouse gas emissions, biofuels and the Next Generation Air Traffic Management System\nhave the highest rankings. TAPS & next generation TAPS combustor technologies are key to\nreducing LTO NOx. Finally, engine and airframe noise technologies, as well as airframe\nshielding, are critical to the NASA noise goal.\n\n134\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic

This helps to differentiate the risks, especially\nthe medium ones, as some are more \xe2\x80\x9chard fail\xe2\x80\x9d (high consequence), but can be low likelihood of\nfailure. Others are \xe2\x80\x9csoft fail\xe2\x80\x9d, in that the consequence of failure is lower, but the likelihood of not\nreaching the full potential is higher.\nTable 7.4 shows the assessment of risk for each of the candidate technology groups. First, the\ntechnologies were assessed by subject matter experts on a simple High/Medium/Low scale.\nImbalances between disciplines were addressed and the risk level assessed on a universal scale.\nRisks were assessed primarily for technical impact. For instance, Risk ID 1, Low sulfur Jet A,\nsynthetic fuel and biofuels, the technical risk of integrating the fuels into the airplanes is low \xe2\x80\x93\nnoted as \xe2\x80\x9cX int\xe2\x80\x9d in the table, alternative fuels have been demonstrated at a fairly high TRL. The\nrisk for synthetics and especially biofuels are being able to produce them in a large enough\nquantity to make an impact. This is more of an economic and political issue than a technical one,\nand is thus beyond the scope of consideration here.\nFor most technologies, the risk across the spectrum of airplane concepts is broadly equal. One\nitem where this is not the case is risk item 11, Active/Passive Aeroelastic Response for Load\n144\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nControl. In this case, the technology is much more critical to the high aspect ratio, high wing\nconcepts, Sugar High and Sugar Volt, so they have been designated with a consequence of 5,\nversus 3 for the other concepts. However, as the technology is reasonably well understood, the\nrisk of failure is designated fairly low, at 2.\nTable 7.4 \xe2\x80\x93 Candidate Technologies Risk Assessment\nTechnical Risk\nTechnology\n\nRisk ID High\n\nLow sulfur Jet-A, Synthetic or Biofuels\nNextGen ATM Capable\nHigh Performance Modular Batteries\nNatural Laminar Flow\nFuselage & Wing Riblets\nRelaxed Static Stability & Increased CLMax Empennage\nAdvanced Supercritical Airfoil\nLow Interference Nacelles\nLow Drag Strut (no interference, laminar flow in NLF)\nAirframe Noise Shielding\nActive/Passive Aeroelastic Response for Load Control\nLightweight Wing Folds\nAdv.

For the purposes of\nthis roadmap the technology is limited to the on-aircraft components only. Overall these new concepts\nwill impact every phase of flight in some way. Increased situational awareness of other aircraft will\nallow for reduced taxi times. Better aircraft positioning data and route planning will allow for a more fuel\noptimized climb and reduced separation requirements. Better weather detection means that pilots can\noptimize their route in flight to find the compromise in avoiding the weather while still retaining a fuel\nefficient trajectory. Increased communications and optimized planning will allow for better descent\nprofiles to save fuel, increase safety, and reduce noise.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\n151\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B

Work completed includes the development of a comprehensive future\nscenario for world-wide commercial aviation, the consideration and selection of baseline and\nadvanced configurations for study, the generation of technology suites for each configuration,\ndetailed performance analysis of the baseline, reference, and advanced configurations, noise and\nemissions of all concepts, and the development of technology risks and roadmaps.\nThe future scenario is based on a 20-year current market outlook process that Boeing has used\nfor the last 40 years. The future scenario was used to establish baseline, reference, and advanced\naircraft in three size classes (regional, medium, and large) for the 2008-2055 timeframe. Also\nderived from the future scenario were the payload, speed, design range, and average range for\neach of the size classes. For this study, it was decided to concentrate design and analysis\nresources on a medium size aircraft carrying 154 passengers to a maximum range of 3500 nm.\nA concept selection workshop was held at Georgia Tech to discuss and select advanced concept\nconfigurations and enabling propulsion technologies. From the workshop and post-workshop\ndiscussions, the following five configurations were selected for detailed analysis:\n1. SUGAR Free \xe2\x80\x93 Current technology, similar to 737 class aircraft. Used as Baseline for\nperformance comparisons.\n2. Refined SUGAR \xe2\x80\x93 Basic conventional configuration with estimated 2030-2035 N+3\ntechnologies, including improved NEXTGEN air traffic control mission efficiency.\nIncludes \xe2\x80\x9cgFan\xe2\x80\x9d turbofan engine from GE.\n3. SUGAR High \xe2\x80\x93 High span strut-braced wing configuration with advanced 2030-2035\nN+3 technologies. Assumes significant technology development beyond the technologies\nin the Refined SUGAR concept. \xe2\x80\x9cgFan+\xe2\x80\x9d turbofan and open fan propulsion options\nsupplied by GE.\n4. SUGAR Volt \xe2\x80\x93 Builds off of SUGAR High configuration to add electric propulsion\ntechnologies. Initially considered a variety of electric-propulsion architectures (Battery\nelectric only, fuel-cell gas turbine hybrid, battery electric gas turbine hybrid), but Boeing\npoint-of-departure sizing analysis and GE analysis led to selection of battery gas turbine\nhybrid propulsion architecture. \xe2\x80\x9chFan\xe2\x80\x9d turbofan-electric hybrid engine data developed by\nGE.\n5. SUGAR Ray \xe2\x80\x93 A HWB configuration that uses a similar suite of advanced technologies\nas the SUGAR High. Primary design emphasis is on reducing aircraft noise, while\nmaintaining performance similar to the SUGAR High.\nTechnology and system experts were engaged to establish technology suites for each of the five\nconfigurations. Technologies were selected in four categories: Aero, Structural, Subsystem, and\nPropulsion. Refined SUGAR technologies assume a \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness as usual\xe2\x80\x9d technology development\nbetween now and 2030-2035. SUGAR High, SUGAR Volt, and SUGAR Ray assume significant\nadditional focused development of technologies for these aircraft.\n187\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nTo begin the analysis and sizing process, a point-of-departure sizing analysis was conducted.\nThis conceptual analysis provided initial sizing information to start the more detailed design and\nanalysis process. These results established \xe2\x80\x9cgoal\xe2\x80\x9d performance levels for the configurations and\ntheir technologies. For the SUGAR Volt, the point-of-departure analysis included a trade study\nto establish required battery technology levels and to compare various electric propulsion\narchitectures. Ultimately a battery electric, gas turbine hybrid propulsion architecture was\nselected. These results were presented at the 6-month review, and for the average 900 nm\nmission, showed approximately a 50% reduction in fuel burn for the Refined SUGAR, a 58%\nreduction for the SUGAR High, and up to a 90% reduction in fuel used for the SUGAR Volt.\nDetailed analysis and sizing began when the point-of-departure results were used to draw each\nconfiguration. From this geometry model, aerodynamics and mass properties analyses were\nconducted on the as-drawn configuration. The point-of-departure results were also used to\ndevelop an initial size for the engines. Then a mission performance analysis was used to resize\nthe as-drawn aircraft to meet all constraints. In some cases, constraints were adjusted as part of a\nrequirements analysis trade study. Detailed analysis and sizing was completed for all\nconfigurations.\nThe Refined SUGAR results indicate a 44% reduction in fuel burn compared to the\nSUGAR Free baseline on a 900nm mission. Opportunities have been identified for up to\na 54% fuel burn reduction by using the gFan+ engine and a higher span wing. NOx\nemissions were reduced to 42% of CAEP 6 levels by using an advanced combustor. CO2\nemissions can be reduced by 72% by adding biofuels to the other technologies. Noise is\nreduced by 16 db. Design takeoff distances of 8200 ft can be achieved at full weight or\nreduced to 5500 ft or less for the average mission fuel load.\nThe SUGAR High results indicate a 39% reduction in fuel burn compared to the SUGAR\nFree baseline on a 900nm mission. Opportunities for wing weight reduction and\naerodynamic improvements have been identified for up to a 58% fuel burn reduction.\nNOx emissions were reduced to 28% of CAEP 6 levels by using an advanced combustor.\nCO2 emissions can be reduced by 69% by adding biofuels to the other technologies.\nNoise is reduced by 22 db. Design takeoff distances of 8200 ft can be achieved at full\nweight or reduced to 6000 ft or less for the average mission fuel load.\nThe SUGAR Volt results indicate a 63% reduction in fuel burn compared to the SUGAR\nFree baseline on a 900nm mission. Opportunities have been identified for up to a 90%\nfuel burn reduction through greater electric usage. If total energy usage (fuel plus\nelectricity) is considered, a 56% reduction is achieved. NOx emissions were reduced to\n21% of CAEP 6 levels by using an advanced combustor with a potential for even greater\nreductions (to 11%) by optimizing electric motor usage. CO2 emissions can be reduced\nby 81% by adding biofuels to the other technologies. Noise is reduced by at least 22 db,\nwith more reduction available by optimizing the electric motor usage and trajectory\nduring takeoff and climb-out. Design takeoff distances of 8200 ft can be achieved at full\nweight or reduced to 4000-5200 ft for the average mission takeoff weight.\nThe SUGAR Ray results indicate a 43% reduction in fuel burn compared to the SUGAR\nFree baseline on a 900nm mission. NOx emissions were reduced to 28% of CAEP 6\nlevels. CO2 emissions can be reduced by 75% by adding biofuels to the other\ntechnologies. Due to additional airframe shielding benefits, noise is reduced by 37 db.\n188\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nThe team conducted a Technology Workshop in November 2009. At this workshop, the team\naccelerated the final technology roadmap prioritization and risk assessment. The risk associated\nwith the technology suites for each configuration has been assessed and the relationship between\neach technology (or technology group) and each NASA goal has been quantified. Development\nroadmaps for each technology (or technology group) have been established.\nA wide range of technologies contribute to substantial fuel burn reduction. Biofuels are a large\ncontributor to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Advanced combustor technology is key to\nreducing NOx emissions. Reducing aircraft noise requires an array of engine and airframe noise\ntechnologies.\nFinally, the results of the configuration assessment and technology analysis processes were used\nto develop recommendations for Phase 2 work.\n\n8.2 \xe2\x80\x93 Conclusions\n1. Fuel Burn \xe2\x80\x93 The NASA fuel burn goal of a 70% reduction is very aggressive. A\ncombination of air traffic management, airframe, and propulsion improvements were\nshown to achieve a 44-58% reduction in fuel burn for conventional propulsion. The\naddition of hybrid electric propulsion to the technology suite has the potential for fuel\nburn reductions of 70-90%. If electric energy is considered in a modified goal of \xe2\x80\x9cenergy\nusage\xe2\x80\x9d, then a 56% or greater reduction in energy use is possible.\n2. Greenhouse Gases \xe2\x80\x93 Although NASA did not establish a goal for greenhouse gas\nemissions, Boeing considered the goal of reducing life cycle CO2 emissions. The fuel\nburn reductions identified above directly reduce CO2 emissions as well. Sustainable\nbiofuels can be used to reduce CO2 emissions by 72% for conventional propulsion and\neven more with hybrid electric propulsion using \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d electrical power to charge the\nbattery system.\n3. NOx Emissions \xe2\x80\x93 Landing and takeoff NOx emissions can be at or near the NASA goal\nof a 75% reduction from CAEP 6 using advanced combustor technology. The use of\nelectric power in the hybrid electric propulsion concept offers the opportunity for even\nlower emissions.\n4. Noise \xe2\x80\x93 The original Phase I noise reduction goal to provide a 55 DNL contour at the\nairport boundary is difficult to achieve. An investigation of airport characteristics shows\nthat a 1.8 nm boundary distance is representative. At this distance a 45 dB reduction\nrelative to the SUGAR Free is needed to provide the 55 DNL contour. However, the best\nperforming configuration, SUGAR Ray, achieved only a 37 dB noise reduction and needs\na larger 2.5 nm boundary to contain the 55 DNL contour. To further reduce the airport\nboundary distance, or meet the updated 71 dB reduction NASA goal, requires significant\nadditional reduction in aircraft noise.\n5. Field Length \xe2\x80\x93 Takeoff distances are designed to be approximately 8,200 ft at Maximum\nTakeoff Weight (MTOW). For the average 900 nm range with reduced takeoff weight,\ndistances of approximately 5,000 ft are achieved. The use of hybrid electric propulsion\nallows additional application of power for takeoff, possibly lowering the takeoff distance\neven more. This was achieved without adding aggressive high lift technologies. For the\nstudy, it was assumed that a takeoff distance of approximately 5,000 ft for the average\nrange mission is sufficient for operation at an adequate number of airports to support\n189\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\nnecessary operations. We chose not to expend limited study resources to further\ninvestigate configurations and technologies needed to achieve shorter takeoff distances.\n6. Advanced Configurations \xe2\x80\x93 The SUGAR High configuration has potential to beat the\nconventional configuration (Refined SUGAR) with regard to fuel burn, but the present\nuncertainty in the wing weight and high cruise lift coefficient prevents a definitive\nconclusion at this time. The SUGAR Ray HWB configuration is clearly the quietest.\n7. Technologies \xe2\x80\x93 A wide portfolio of technologies is needed to achieve the NASA N+3\ngoals. Significant improvements in air traffic management, and aerodynamic, structural,\nsystem, and propulsion technologies are needed to address fuel burn goals. Biofuels are\nneeded to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Advanced combustor technology is\nnecessary to meet NOx goals. Even more aggressive engine and airframe noise reduction\ntechnologies than applied in this study are needed. The hybrid electric engine technology\nis a clear winner, as it has the potential to improve performance relative to all of the\nNASA goals.\n\n8.3 \xe2\x80\x93 Recommendations\nBased on the Phase 1 configuration assessment and technology analysis results, we recommend\nthe following for Phase 2 activities (in approximate order of priority):\n1. Additional design and analysis of hybrid electric gas turbine propulsion architectures and\nthe integration of the concept into other configurations (like the Refined SUGAR or\nSUGAR Ray). A noise analysis for the hybrid electric propulsion system needs to be\nconducted to determine potential noise benefits for operating on partial or full electric\npower.\n2. A comprehensive study of high aspect ratio strut/truss braced wings, accounting for\ncoupled aerodynamics, structures, materials, propulsion, and control. Making this wing\naerodynamically effective while controlling weight is key to enabling this high L/D\nconfiguration. A detailed finite element model is needed, and an aeroelastic test is\nnecessary to validate the structural analysis and to determine the weight of the wing. The\nhigh cruise lift coefficient required at Mach 0.70 for high aspect ratio wings requires\nadditional analysis, optimization, and experimental validation.\n3. Additional noise technologies need to be identified and validated to achieve the updated\nNASA -71 db noise goal. This could include use of trajectory optimization, greater use of\nelectric propulsion, turboprops, and low noise propellers. Airframe and tail shielding\nshould continue to be investigated in HWB and conventional configurations.\n4. A follow-on to this study to consider the synergistic benefits of methane and/or hydrogen\nfuel (high heating value, thermal management, fuel cells, and superconducting electric\npropulsion).\n5. A follow-on to this study to include the large aircraft size class. It is anticipated that some\ntechnologies will become more important as the length of the cruise segment is increased.\n6. An aircraft power system study to determine the best architecture for aircraft power,\nincluding diesel and conventional APUs, fuel-cells, batteries, and both engine power\ntake-off and bleed air. This study should include traditional, more-electric and all-electric\naircraft system architectures, per aircraft size class.\n190\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n7. A follow-on to this study to include the regional jet size class. Special emphasis should\nbe placed on low noise propulsion, field length, and possible use of electric or hybrid\nelectric propulsion.\nAdditionally, work should continue to investigate and validate the performance for the HWB\nconfiguration. It is anticipated that the HWB configuration will be emphasized in the N+2\nEnvironmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program, as well as other ongoing NASA, Air\nForce, and Boeing funded projects. This other work can be effectively leveraged, and the HWB\nconcept should continue to be carried in the N+3 program, as most N+3 technologies can be\napplied to improve the HWB concept as well.\n\n191\n\nNASA Contract NNL08AA16B \xe2\x80\x93 NNL08AD01T \xe2\x80\x93 Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research \xe2\x80\x93 Phase I \xe2\x80\x93 Final Report\n\n9.0 \xe2\x80\x93 References\n[1] \xe2\x80\x93\n\nUS Department of Transportation; Research and Innovative Technology Administration;\nBureau of Transportation Statistics, Airline Data and Statistics.
