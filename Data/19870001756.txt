b'N87-II189\nEVALUATION\n\nRESULTS\n\nNational\n\nOF THE 700 \xc2\xb0C CHINESE\n\nSTRAIN\n\nGAGES\n\nHoward F. Hobart\nAeronautics\nand Space Administration\nLewis Research Center\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThere has been a continuing interest and need for resistance strain gauges\ncapable of making static strain measurements on components located in the hot\nsection of gas-turblne\nengines.\nA paper by Tsen-tal Wu, et al., (ref. l) describes\nthe development\nand evaluation of hlgh-temperature\n(700 \xc2\xb0C) gauges fabricated from\nspecially developed Fe-Cr-AI-V-TI-Y\nalloy wire.\nAs part of the Lewis HOST program,\nseveral of these gauges and a quantity of P12-2 ceramic adhesive were purchased for\nevaluation from the China National Aero-Technology\nImport and Export Corporation\nof\nBelJlng, China.\nNine members of the aircraft turbine engine community were invited to participate in an evaluation of these gauges.\nEach participant was sent one strain gauge,\na small amount of ceramic adhesive, instructions for mounting the\ngauge on a test beam (not supplied), and a set of suggestions for the evaluation\nexperiment.\n\nture,\n\nThe following discussion includes data on gauge factor variation with temperaapparent strain, and drift.\nThe reported results are from six participants.\n\nDISCUSSION\nGauge\n\nFactor\n\nFigure 1 is a plot of percentage change in gauge factor from its room temperature value versus temperature for five evaluators.\nThe trend is for gauge factor to\ndecrease with increasing temperature.\nThe average slope is -3.5 percent per lO0 K,\nwith a maximum data spread of _8 percent.\nThe curve labeled Wu is from reference l\nand is based on eight gauges bonded to both sides of a constant-moment\nbeam strained\nto 938 mlcrostraln.\nCurves from the other evaluators are averaged data in both tension and compression at several strain levels in the range 300 to 2000 mlcrostraln.\nBy way of comparison,\nsome interesting results have recently been reported on\nby Stetson (ref. 2) wlth Kanthal A-l (Fe-Cr-Al-Co) gauges.\nThese gauges exhibit\ngauge factor characteristics\nsimilar to the Chinese gauges (fig. 2).\nThe solid line\ncurves are the envelope of curves from flgure l and the dashed llne curves show the\ndata spread on the eight Kanthal A-l gauges tested.\nThe average values of gauge factor at room temperature and the Indlcated high\ntemperatures are listed in table I. All the Chinese gauges used in the evaluation\nhad a specified room temperature gauge factor of 2.62, which is within 4 percent of\nthe average of the five gauges listed in table I.\n\n77\n\nApparent Strain\nThe comparison of apparent strain data between evaluators is difficult\nbecause\nseveral factors influence the shape of the reslstance-temperature curve. Aside from\nthe sensor temperature coefficient of resistance, the magnitude and curve shape\nappear to be most strongly affected by the cooling rate of the previous temperature\nexcursion and to a lesser degree by the difference in temperature coefficient of\nexpansion between the gauge alloy and the substrate material.\nA further consideration is the construction of the Chinese gauges. These gauges have a relatively\nlarge amount of ceramic cement, which encapsulates the wire and, together with the\nlarge size of the gauge, could influence apparent strain by causing a bending moment\nto occur, especially if bonded to a thin substrate.\nTable II lists the evaluator, the substrate material\nnumber of thermal cycles reported.\n\nused in the test,\n\nand the\n\nFigure 3, a plot of apparent strain versus temperature, is based on an average\nof the numberof cycles from table II.\nAll curves are normalized to pass through\nzero at room temperature. A gauge factor of 2.0 was used to calculate mlcrostraln.\nIn order to comparethe Kanthal A-l data wlth the Chinese gauges, figure 4 was\ndrawn to showthe envelope of the curves from figure 3, shown as solid lines, and\nthe Kanthal A-l data, plotted as dashed lines.\nIt is obvious from figure 4 that\nboth alloys have similar S-shaped curves, but the Kanthal A-l has a much higher\nvalue of apparent strain at elevated temperatures. The maximum\ndata spread for the\nalloys at any temperature is similar in spite of the fact that the Kanthal data were\nobtained from a single facility\nand the samesubstrate material for all eight gauges\nas opposed to how the Chinese gauge data were obtained. The implication here is\nthat under carefully controlled tests, the Chinese alloy should exhibit much better\nrepeatability\nin cycle-to-cycle apparent strain testing.\nFigure 5 has been reproduced directly from the data of evaluator 5. This figure is a typical slow cycle and is presented to illustrate\nthe inflection\npoint,\nwhich is present in each cycle at about 700 K (425 \xc2\xb0C). Two other evaluators also\nshow a bump occurring near that same temperature.\nA possible explanation for this\nanomaly is the extremely high negative drift rate in the range of 700 to 870 K, as\nreported by evaluator 3. This behavior, which is related to some specific metallurgical process, reinforces the statements in the CONCLUSIONS pertaining to the care\nrequired in using these gauges in that unstable temperature\nregion.\n\nDrift\nDrift test results are shown in figure 6. All evaluators reporting drift data\nagree on the slope of the curves, with the long-term (50 hr) Lewis data having an\noverall drift rate of about -9 mlcrostraln/hr.\nShort-term drift rates, however, are\nhigher, in the range -30 to -50 mlcrostraln\nfor the first hour.\nRecent supplementary data by evaluator 3 (fig. 7) indicates that drift rate is\na strong function of temperature level.\nThere appears to be short-term instability\nin the 700 to BTO K range, wlth drift rates as high as 1700 mlcrostraln\nfor the\nfirst hour at 870 K.\n\n78\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTest results have been presented from five participants in the comparative\nevaluation of the Chinese strain gauges. Data are also included from work done by\nProfessor Wufrom his original paper describing the Chinese alloy.\nK. Stetson of\nUTRC\nand H. Grant of PWA,as part of a recent contract effort for NASA,have published data in a contractor report on Kanthal A-l gauges. Kanthal A-l is a ternary\nalloy similar to the Chinese alloy, but with different trace elements\xe2\x80\xa2 These data\nare also included. HowardGrant will discuss the Kanthal A-1 results fully in the\nfollowing session.\nGage factor. - Results of gauge factor versus temperature tests show gauge factor decreasing with increasing temperature.\nThe average slope Is -3.5 percent per\nlO0 K, with an uncertainty\nband of 18 percent.\nValues of room temperature\ngauge\nfactor for the Chinese and Kanthal A-l gauges averaged 2.73 and 2.12, respectively.\nThe room temperature\ngauge factor of the Chinese gauges was specified to be 2.62.\nApparent strain. - The apparent strain data for both the Chinese alloy and Kanthal A-l showed large cycle to cycle nonrepeatablllty.\nThls variability is influenced by heating and cooling rates of the previous cycle, dwell times at various\ntemperatures and type of substrate to which the gauge Is bonded.\nH. Grant of PWA in\nConnecticut as a result of extensive testing, has identified cooling rate as the\npredominant factor.\nAll apparent strain curves had a similar S shape, first going negative and then\nrising to positive value with increasing temperatures.\nThe mean curve for the\nChinese gauges between room temperature and lO00 K had a total apparent strain of\n1500 mlcrostraln.\nThe equivalent value for Kanthal A-l was about 9000 mlcrostraln.\nDrift. - Drift tests at 950 K for 50 hr show an average drift rate of about -9\nmlcrostraln/hr.\nShort-term (1 hr) rates are higher, averaging about -40 mlcrostraln\nfor the first hour.\nIn the temperature\nrange 700 to 870 K, however, short-term\ndrift rates can be as high as 1700 mlcrostraln for the first hour.\nTherefore,\nstatic strain measurements\nin thls temperature range should be avoided, and care\nmust be taken in making drift corrections, especially when drift rate is expressed\nas a small hourly rate based on some longterm test.\nThe results of these tests indicate that to use these gauges at high temperatures for measuring static strain to a reasonable accuracy level, certain precautions are required.\nGauge temperature must be known to allow compensation\nfor gauge\nfactor and apparent strain; also, gauges must be calibrated at known cooling rates\nto establish repeatable apparent strain.\nA hlghtemperature\nsoak for at least l hr\nappears necessary to ensure that the apparent strain reaches the same value "starting point" for each cycle.\nThe actual strain measurement\nshould then be made at\nthe same cooling rate if possible.\n\nREFERENCES\nl\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\nWu, Tsen-tal, et al.: Development of Temperature-compensated\nResistance Strain\nGauges for Use to 700 \xc2\xb0C.\nExp.
