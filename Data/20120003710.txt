b'2011 FALL AGU MEETING\nDecember 5-9, 2011\nTitle : Weekly Cycle of Lightning and Associated Patterns of Rainfall,\nCloud, and Aerosols over Korea and Adjacent Oceans during Boreal Summer.\nBy Ji-In Kim (WEST) and Kyu-Myong Kim (Morgan State Univ)\nAbstract:\nIn this study, we analyze the weekly cycle of lightning over\nKorea and adjacent oceans and associated variations of aerosols, clouds,\nprecipitation, and atmospheric circulations, using aerosol optical depth\n(AOD) from the NASA Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\n(MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), cloud\nproperties from MODIS, precipitation and storm height from Tropical\nRainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, and lightning data from the\nKorean Lightning Detection Network (KLDN) during 9-year from 2002 to\n2010. Lightning data was divided into three approximately equal areas,\nland area of Korea, and two adjacent oceans, Yellow Sea and South Sea.\nPreliminary results show that the number of lightning increases\nduring the middle of the week over Yellow Sea. AOD data also shows\nmoderately significant midweek increase at about the same time as\nlightning peaks. These results are consistent with the recent studies\nshowing the invigoration of storms with more ice hydrometeors by\naerosols, and subsequently wash out of aerosols by rainfall.\nFrequency of lightning strokes tend to peak at weekend in\nland area and over South Sea, indicating local weekly anomalous\ncirculation between land and adjacent ocean. On the other hand,\nlightning frequency over Yellow Sea appears to have very strong weekly\ncycle with midweek peak on around Wednesday. It is speculated that the\nmidweek peak of lightning over Yellow Sea was related with aerosol\ntransport from adjacent land area. AOD data also suggests midweek peak\nover Yellow Sea, however, the weekly cycle of AOD was not statistically\nsignificant.\nChanges in weekly cycle of lightning from pre-monsoon to monsoon\nseason, as well as associated clouds and circulation patterns are also\ndiscussed.\n\n'
