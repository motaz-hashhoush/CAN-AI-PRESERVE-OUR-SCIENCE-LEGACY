b"Potential Market for Satellite Technology\nin Meeting Telecommunication Needs of\nDeveloping Nations\n\nA recent study examined the potential for satellite technology to meet the\ntelecommunication needs of developing nations. The growth of these nations depends on\ntheir attracting and holding the industrial investments of developed nations. This will not\nbe likely with the antiquated telecommunications infrastructure typical of developing\nnations. On the contrary, it will require an infrastructure that is compatible with\ninternational standards. Most of the developing nations perceive this necessity and are\npursuing the necessary upgrades. The rate of replacement, types of technology, services\naffected, and the terrestrial/satellite mix differ by each nation's priorities and gross national\nproduct (GNP).\nTo gain a perspective on the variety of national needs, the NASA Lewis Research Center\ncommissioned Space Systems Loral to perform case studies of Brazil, China, and Mexico.\nMexico has made the most progress in terms of percent of population served and the\nsophistication of services offered. Although China lags behind Mexico in coverage\nachieved, its recent fiber, cellular, and satellite installations have been impressive,\nconsidering the nation has a much larger population and land mass.\nIn each of these nations, it was found necessary to separate the telecommunications needs\nof the general population from those of the business community. Because of the expense\ninvolved, these nations have concentrated on meeting the needs of the business community\nfirst. And this is particularly true of China. In general, the primary telecommunications\ndemand is for conventional telephone service and television. By volume, data services are\na smaller niche market, primarily used by government and business communities.\nHowever, this does not mean that the data market is not important. In fact, these\ngovernments see data services as playing a critical role in business development.\n\nConsequently, the thrust of the telecommunications upgrades tends to favor fiber for\nurban areas, wireless for outlying areas, and fiber or satellite to connect the two.\nChina, Brazil, and Mexico are all using satellites to augment their respective\ntelecommunication infrastructures. However, they are not relying solely on satellites to\nmeet their needs. Each of the countries is pursuing both wireless and wired\ntelecommunications technologies in parallel. For example, China is installing terrestrial\nfiber networks in urban areas along with wireless cellular systems. In parallel, they are\npursuing both a very-small-aperture terminal (VSAT) based backbone data network and a\nnationwide fiber network interconnection.\nSome of the services driving the satellite markets include broadcast television distribution,\nrural telephone exchange interconnection, private VSAT networks, mobile telephony, and\ndirect-to-home television. For these, terminal equipment must be widely available,\ninexpensive, and easy to use. Furthermore, for the rural telephone exchange (and perhaps\nthe mobile) application, the overall satellite network must incorporate many of the\nfunctions of the terrestrial telephone system, namely switching, routing, and access\ncontrol.\n\nBibliography\nBarker, K.; Barnes, C.; and Price, K.M.: Space-Based Communications Infrastructure for\nDeveloping Countries.
