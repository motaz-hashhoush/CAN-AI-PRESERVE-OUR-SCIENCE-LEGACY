This will be accomplished by building beams of a single material and composite beams of a mixture of materials (popsicle sticks, fiberboard sheets, and tongue depressors); testing these layered beams to determine how and where they fail; and based on the failure analysis, designing a layered beam that will fail in a predicted manner. The students will learn the effects of lamination, adhesion, and geometry in layered beam construction on beam strength and failure location.", "title": "Craft Stick Beams", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T12:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960052152, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Karplus, Alan K."}, "organization": {"name": "College of Western New England", "location": "Springfield, MA United States"}}, "id": "c5ca1197023943599635c3f135d15f91"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960052152, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960052152, "id": "f54f776607f6409c92b6d75fd7efc036", "publicationName": "National Educators' Workshop: Update 95.
