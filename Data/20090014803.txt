EPO-Demos are videotaped, edited, and used to\nenhance existing NASA education resources and programs for educators and students in grades K-12.\nEPO-Demos are designed to support the NASA mission to inspire the next generation of explorers.\nResearch Summary:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEducation Payload Operations - Demonstrations (EPO-Demos) utilizes tools and other common\nitems in the microgravity environment of the ISS to create educational video and multimedia\nproducts that inspire the next generation of mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and other\nscientists.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEPO-Demos are a continuation of education demonstrations that have been conducted by ISS\ncrewmembers since Expedition 7. The products are used for demonstrations and to support\ncurriculum materials that are distributed across the United States and internationally to educators\nto encourage students to pursue studies and careers in science, technology, engineering, and\nmathematics and inspire the next generation of space explorers.\n\nDetailed Research Description: The objective of Education Payload Operations - Demonstrations\n(EPO-Demos) is to use toys, tools and other common items in the microgravity environment of the ISS to\ncreate educational video and multimedia products that inspire the next generation of engineers,\nmathematicians, physicists, scientists and space explorers. The EPO-Demos support curriculum\nmaterials that are distributed across the United States and internationally. Each ISS Expedition involves\ndifferent on-orbit activities and themes, as well as different partners, such as museums, universities, and\npublic school districts.\n\nSome of the activities cover physical properties, such as Newton's Laws of Motion or Bernoulli's Principle\nfor air pressure, and others are specific to life in space, such as explaining how the ISS solar panels work\nor demonstrating extravehicular activities.\nProject Type: Payload\nImages and Captions:\n\nTeaching From Space Office team members in the Johnson Space Center TeleScience Center supporting an\nEPO-Demo conducted by astronaut Suni Williams.

Each demonstration will have its own props (e.g., toys or tools). The\ndemonstration is then dismantled and returned to stowage. After the videos are returned to Earth, they\nwill be used to develop teaching guides, project plans, and educational packages focusing on the physical\nsciences and technology.\nCategory: Observing the Earth and Educational Activities\n\nSubcategory: Educational Activities\nSpace Applications: These investigations and related activities will have strong ties to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Vision for\nSpace Exploration and will be designed to encourage students to pursue studies and careers in science,\ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\nEarth Applications: These investigations and related activities will have strong ties to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Vision for\nSpace Exploration and will be designed to encourage students to pursue studies and careers in science,\ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\nManifest Status: Planned\nSupporting Organization: Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD)\nPrevious Missions: EPO-Demos have been performed on multiple Space Shuttle flights.\nWeb Sites:\nJohnson Space Center Education and Student Programs\nhttp://education.jsc.nasa.gov/\nNASA Education Program\nhttp://education.nasa.gov/home/index.html\nCentral Operations of Resources for Educators (CORE)\nhttp://core.nasa.gov/\nRelated Payload(s): EPO, EPO-Kit D, EPO-Educator\n\n"
