Currently, NASA and other organizations are actively working to identify and mature technologies necessary to bring EAP designs to reality. A requirement for the development of any civil aircraft and its systems is to ensure that potential hazards in the design are identified and appropriately mitigated to ensure that the system is safe. During aircraft development, a system safety assessment that consists of a functional hazard assessment is conducted to identify all potential failure conditions of each function, and classify those failures according to the severity of their effects on the aircraft or its occupants. The more severe a function's failure condition classification, the greater the development assurance level required for the function to ensure that the probability of the hazard is acceptably low. Today, aircraft engines and their control systems receive type certificate approval as a stand-alone system to signify their airworthiness. However, the complex coupling and distributed nature of EAP designs are expected to place added challenges on the certification of these systems. This presentation will provide an initial high-level review of the potential failure modes and hazards posed by a generic EAP system along with potential mitigation strategies for those failures. The EAP system is assumed to be a hybrid design consisting of gas turbine engines, mechanical drives, electric machines, power electronics and distribution systems, energy storage devices, and motor driven propulsors. The functionality provided by each of these EAP subsystems will be discussed along with the potential failure modes they may encounter. This will include a discussion of coupled failure effects, where a fault in one EAP subsystem effects the operation of other subsystems in the architecture. Next, potential failure mitigation strategies are discussed including both software-based and hardware-based mitigation strategies. The presentation will conclude with an example evaluation of the potential failure modes and mitigation strategies for a concept EAP system proposed by NASA.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190033197, "endDate": "2019-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "03cd5a65f76b4f7593c4fccaf8463835", "id": "36d9b8d084dc40e4bea72cf21ded6fa2"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) Foundation", "location": "San Diego, CA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "03cd5a65f76b4f7593c4fccaf8463835", "id": "4c65f3546f35400cbad7ef8df271185d"}], "name": "EnergyTech2019 Conference and Expo", "location": "Cleveland, OH", "id": "03cd5a65f76b4f7593c4fccaf8463835", "startDate": "2019-10-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190033197, "id": "5ddffebe14d64636887a1834f3ae1ecc", "publicationDate": "2019-10-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190033197.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190033197/downloads/20190033197.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190033197/downloads/20190033197.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190033197/downloads/20190033197.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
