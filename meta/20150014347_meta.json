The relation between risk, vulnerability, and resilience is analyzed. The paper describes how complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity are the most critical factors in the definition of the approach and criteria for decision-making. Uncertainty in its various forms is what limits our ability to offer definitive answers to questions about the outcomes of alternatives in a decision-making process. It is shown that, although resilience-informed decision-making would seem fundamentally different from risk-informed decision-making, this is not the case as resilience-analysis can be easily incorporated within existing analytic-deliberative decision-making frameworks.\n\n\n\n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150014347, "id": "2729a778388e4fb1b0fa2c05cbf06a6d", "publicationDate": "2015-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150014347.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150014347/downloads/20150014347.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150014347/downloads/20150014347.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150014347/downloads/20150014347.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
