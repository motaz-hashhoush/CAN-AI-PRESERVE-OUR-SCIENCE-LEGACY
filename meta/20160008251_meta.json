NICM also includes the ability to perform cost by analogy as well as joint confidence level (JCL) analysis. The latest version of NICM, Version VI, was released in Spring 2014. This paper will focus on the new features released with NICM VI, which include: 1) The NICM-E cost estimating relationship, which is applicable for instruments flying on Explorer-like class missions; 2) The new cluster analysis ability which, alongside the results of the parametric cost estimation for the user's instrument, also provides a visualization of the user's instrument's similarity to previously flown instruments; and 3) includes new cost estimating relationships for in-situ instruments.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160008251, "endDate": "2014-08-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "f2855cef77884e4f9259aceaa2f2307c", "id": "ab0045b95bf048b4a23ac77870823b7e"}], "name": "AIAA Space 2014", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "f2855cef77884e4f9259aceaa2f2307c", "startDate": "2014-08-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160008251, "id": "22b7a34641ca4965b196396b8ce4c96d", "publicationDate": "2014-08-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
