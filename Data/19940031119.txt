Zimmerman2\nThe ATLAS-series Spacelab missions is comprised of a diverse group of scientific\ninslzurnents,including instrumentsstudying the sun and how the sun\'senergy changes\nacross an eleven-year solar cycle. The ATLAS solar insuumentsare located on one or\nmore palletsin the Orbiter payload bay and use the Orbiter as a pointingplatform for their\nexaminations of the sun. One of the ATLAS insmunentscontaineda sun sensor allowing\nthe scientists and engineers on the ground to see the pointing error of the sun with respect to\nthe instrument and correct for the error based upon the information coming from the sun\nsensor. This paper presents the solar operation activities and flight experience from the\nATLAS 1 and ATLAS 2 missions with particular attention given to identifying the sources\nof pointing discrepancies of the solar instruments and to describe the crew and ground\ncontroller procedures that were developed to correct for these discrepancies. The Orbiter\npointing behavior from the ATLAS I and ATLAS 2 flights presented in this paper can be\napplied to future flights which use the Orbiter as a pointing platform.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Atmospheric\nLaboratory\nfor Applications\nand Science\n(ATLAS)\nseries\nof SlYacelab\nmissions,\nan element of NASA\'s Mission to Planet Earth, is chartered to study the composition\nof\nthe middle\natmosphere\nand the possible\natmospheric\nvariations\ndue to solar changes across an\neleven-year\nsolar cycle.\nThe fh\'st and second missions in the ATLAS series successfully\nflew in\nMarch\n1992 and April 1993 and mission planning\nhas begun to support\nthe ATLAS\n3 launch\nscheduled\nfor October\n1994.\nThe ATLAS\npayload\ncomplement\ncomprises\ninvestigations\nfor both solar sciences\nand\natmospheric\nsciences.\nThe ATLAS instruments\nare also co-manifested\nwith other payloads.\nAs\na result, the solar operations\nare scheduled\nduring the orbital day portion of 20 to 30 orbits during\nthe flight.\nThe orbital\nnight portion\nof each revolution\nis devoted\nto other non-solar\nscience\noperations\nor to instrument\ncooling.\nOVERVIEW\n\nOF ATLAS\n\nSOLAR\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nIn order to better understand\nthe driving force behind global atmospheric\nchanges,\nthe solar\nscience portion of the ATLAS payload intends to measure the total solar irradiance and the solar\nenergy\ndistribution\nand how these properties\nvary with time.\nTwo of the ATLAS\nsolar\ninstruments,\nthe Active Cavity Radiometer\nIrradiance Monitor (ACRIM)\nand the Measurement\nof Solar Constant\nexperiment\n(SOLCON)\nexamine the solar irradiance,\nalso known as the solar\nconstant, and how this value changes with time. The Solar Spectrum Measurement\nexperiment\n(SOLSPEC)\nand the Solar Ultraviolet\nSpectral Irradiance\nMonitor (SUSIM)\nstudy the solar\nenergy\nvariations\nat various wavelengths.\nAlthough\nthe ATLAS\nsolar science\ninstruments\noperate only briefly in the context of an eleven year solar cycle, their ability to be precisely\ncalibrated before and after flight provides an excellent\ncalibration\nsource for satellites operating\nfor extended periods of time. Three of the ATLAS solar instruments\nhave sister instruments\non\nfree-flying\nsatellites.\nDuring the ATLAS\nmissions,\nACRIM\nand SUSIM\ntook coincident\nmeasurements\nwith their counterparts\non the Upper Atmospheric\nResearch\nSatellite\n(LIARS)\nwhich was launched in 1991.\nSOLCON\nprovided comparison\ndata for the Nimbus-7,\nthe Earth\nRadiation Budget Satellites, as well as the ACRIM instrument on ATLAS and UARS.

An additional\nguideline\nexpressed\nby the solar science group states that the\nindividual\nsolar periods\nshould\nbe scheduled\nthroughout\nthe mission\nto provide\nthe greatest\npossible\nseparation\nbetween\nthe first and last observations.\nThis guideline\nis accomplished\nby\nplacing the first solar period directly after mandatory\n24-hour out-gassing.\nThe last solar period is\nscheduled\nsuch that the final observation\noccurs\njust before\nthe required\nPassive\nThermal\nConditioning\nperiod prior to de-orbit.\nThe remaining\nsolar period(s)\nis distributed\nas equally\nas\npossible\n\nbetween\n\nA summary\nof the ATLAS\n1 and ATLAS\n2 solar periods\nis shown in Figure\n1.

[4]\n\n274\n\nThis need for accurate\npointing\ninformation\ncaused the creation of the Pointing and Alignment\nWorkstation\n(PAWS)\nwhich brought together\na small team of engineers\nto gather realtime\npointing\ninformation\nfrom Orbiter and payload\nsources and to examine the pointing\nbehavior\nof\nthe Orbiter and the ATLAS instruments.\nThe PAWS engineers were also tasked to determine the\nmagnitudes of the instrument pointing errors resulting\nfrom the various contributing\nsources.\nPrior to the ATLAS-1\nflight, possible errors sources and their advertised\nlimits were researched.\nThe pointing\nerror sources were identified and grouped as Orbiter-related\nand instrument-related.\nThe primary\nOrbiter-related\nerror sources\nare the IMU uncertainty\nand Orbiter\nthermal\ndistortions.\nThe payload-related\npointing errors sources are thermal distortions and misalignment\nof the pallet, instrument calibration\nerrors and mechanical\nmisalignments.\n[5]\nUsing\n\nthe identified\n\npointing\n\nerror sources\n\nand\n\nadvertised\n\naccuracies\n\nfrom\n\nOrbiter\n\nand ATLAS\n\npayload documentation,\na pre-mission\nerror tree was constructed\nto provide the only prediction\nto\nthe on-orbit\npointing\nenvironment.\nThe pre-mission\npredictions\nof an example\nACRIM\ninstrument pointing\nerrors budget are shown in Figure 5.\n\nACR1\n\nPointing\nErrors\n\xc2\xb11.15 \xc2\xb0\nI\n\nI\n\n[\nPayload/Pallet\n_-+0.56\xc2\xb0\n\n_+1.0\nOrbiter\xc2\xb0\nI\n\n[\nS truc tural\n5.-0.8 \xc2\xb0\n\n!\nI\nInstrument/]\nSensor(5)\n\nI\n\n[\n\n_0"17\xc2\xb0\n\nOrthogrid\nPallet/ \xc2\xb0\n_-_+0.53\n\nJ\n\n1) All values are 3-sigma about all axes.\n2) The values are combined via RSS.\n3) Known better following alignment\n4) Estimate; no known data\n5) Estimate;\n\nJ\n\ndata to be supplied\n\n]\nFigure\nOrbiter-based\n\nPointing\n\n5.

Prior to the flight of ATLAS 1, the payload planning team developed\na procedure to allow\nfor the solar experimenters\nto request\npointing\ncorrections\nin the event\nof instrument\nmisalignment.\nOne of the ATLAS solar instruments,\nSUSIM, was equipped\nwith a sensor to\ndetermine the relative position of the sun in the instrument field of view.\nDuring ATLAS\n1, it\nbecame\nclear that the SUSIM sun sensor would be used as the basis for determining\npointing\naccuracy for the solar experiment\ncomplement.\nFortunately,\nthe majority\nof solar observations\nwere performed\nwithout difficulty.\nHowever, at the beginning\nof the third solar period, SUSIM\nnoted from their data that a pointing correction\nwould be necessary.\nThis initiated a call/response\nloop between\nthe planning\nteam and SUSIM which proved only marginal effectiveness\nat fixing\nthe problem\nand in some cases made it worse.\nFigure 7 shows a histogram\nof the SUSIM sun\nsensor data for the first four observations\nof the third solar period on ATLAS\n1 [5].\n\ne.\n\n"\n\no.o ....\n\nttl\n\nt\n\n___\n\n.......\n\n__\n\n.\n\ni\n\n: I\n\nI\n\n"\n\nlo\n,\n167\n\nIqT\xc2\xa2_\n\n_,,t,,,\n\n,,,,\n\n,I,,,,,\n16.q\'\n\n1_;_\n\nFigure\n\n7.

The maneuvers\nwere very small, approximately\n0.3 \xc2\xb0, and were extremely\ndifficult to perform manually.\nConsequently,\nthe ATLAS-2\nSUSIM\nalignment\nverifications\nwere performed\nfrom a detailed\nlist of procedures\nfor the complex\noperations,\nand by using the DAP, the pilot performed\nprecise Orbiter pointing.\nThe solar criss-cross\nare directed.from\nthe\nperform\neight scans\nscan was developed\nwas scheduled\nusing\ndeveloped\nto simplify\n\nactivities are much less complex than the 5-point alignment verification\nand\nattitude timeline.\nA special solar crisscross on ATLAS-2\nwas developed\nto\nacross the sun in a pattern resembling\nan asterisk.\nSince this complex\nsun\nduring the flight, it was not possible\nto develop\na crew procedure\nand so it\nthe attitude timeline.\nFor future ATLAS missions,\na crew procedure\nwill be\nthe complex\nsun scan activities.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere was much pressure during the ATLAS 1 on-orbit operations\nto quickly assess and correct\nthe pointing\nerrors.\nImmediate\naction caused two problems:\nto understand\nthe pointing\nbehavior,\ntime was required to let the trends develop and to examine\nthese trends; the second, is to properly\ncoordinate\nthe necessary\nchanges\nto the solar operations\nthrough\na number\nof different\ngroups\nlocated at different\nNASA centers and ultimately\nto the crew.\nResulting\nfrom lessons learned during ATLAS 1, hardware\nand procedural\nchanges were made to\nallow the ATLAS 2 crew to view on-board\ninstrument\npointing data and to correct the instrument\npointing\nerrors immediately.\nThe crew and flight planners\nwere extejasively\ntrained prior to the\nsecond ATLAS\nflight to perform the correction\nprocedures.\nThe flight of ATLAS\n1 for payload planners provided\nmany lessons\nfor understanding\nthe\nbehavior\nof the Orbiter\nas a pointing\nplatform.\nThis experience\npermitted\nimproved\nsolar\noperations\nfor ATLAS\n2 and can be applied to future flights which use the Orbiter as a pointing\nplatform.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe author\'s\nwould\nlike to thank the JSC Pointing\nOfficers,\nJSC Guidance,\nControl Officers,\nand the PAWS engineers\nfor providing\ninsight and experience\nhelp and suggestions.\n\nNavigation,\nand\nwhen we needed\n\nThis work was supported\nby the National\nAeronautic\nand Space Administration\n(NASA)/\nMarshall\nSpace Flight Center (MSFC),\nHuntsville,\nAlabama,\nunder Contract\nNAS8-41000.\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nATLAS Brochure, NASA/MSFC Payload Project Office, 1993.\nSUSIM Instrument Interface Agreement, NASA/MSFC Document JA-606E Rev.
