Its\n\ngreatest assest, however, is its adherence capability, even under extreme\nconditions such as salt fog and thermal shock.\nZinc has a higher electromotive potential than iron or steel and, in\nthe presence of an electrolyte such as saltwater, will be sacrificed to\nprotect the steel.\n\nWhen zinc ions go into solution, they liberate elec-\n\ntrons, which cause a current flow into the steel to prevent ferrous ions\nfrom going into solution and beginning the electrochemical corrosion\nprocess.\n\nTo function anodically, the zinc particles must be in intimate\n\ncontact with one another so that the coating film is electrically conductive.\n\nContact is achieved by very high zinc loading Aith a relatively\n\nsmall amount of binder.\nPotassium silicate is known to be an effective binder for zinc dust,\nprovided the mole ratios of silica to potassium oxide are maintained at\na high level.\n\nThe mole ratios of currently available zinc-rich coatings\n\ngenerally peak at about 3.1:1; however, because of its unique binder\nformulation, the NASA coating boasts a range of 4.8:1 to 5.3:1.\nThe NASA coating contains 19 to 23 parts (percent solids in solution)\nby weight of potassium silicate, plus zinc dust (at 6 to 27 times the\npercent by weight silicate solids).\n\nTo this basic mixture, methyltri-\n\nmethoxysilane is added in amounts up to 3% by .veight to act as a buffer\n\n*\nMany coatings are postcured, which requires spraying .vith water after\napplication.\n\nand to provide better adherence to steel.\nmixing with the zinc.\n\nThe silane also facilitates\n2\nThe original formulations are given in Table 1.\n\nThe coating has a water base and is nontoxic and nonflammable.\n\nTest Performance\nTen panels coated with formulations of NASA\'s zinc-dust composition\nwere placed in the salt spray chamber at the California Department of\nTransportation\'s Materials and Testing Laboratory on March 11, 1974.\nThe formulation selected for this test vvas:\nPercent by Weight\nPotassium silicate solution 20K 5.3\n\n17.6\n\nMethyltrimethoxysilane\n\n0.4\n\nZinc dust, 325 mesh\n\n82.0\n\nSeven of the panels were given the following antifouling topcoats\n(developed for use on Navy vessels):\nUrethane-polyester\n\n(vinyl phenolic tiecoat)\n\nEpoxy (vinyl phenolic tiecoat)\nVinyl acetate\nVinyl acetate (vinyl phenolic tiecoat)\nChlorinated rubber (vinyl phenolic tiecoat)\nVinyl chloride (vinyl phenolic tiecoat)\nVinyl chloride GW (vinyl phenolic tiecoat)\nAll three panels coated with the zinc-dust formulations alone gave excellent performances, with no rusting or blistering after 5300 hours in\nthe salt spray chamber (Figure 1).\n\nThe vinyl acetate with vinyl phenolic\n\ntiecoat also withstood a 5300-hour test with no sign of corrosion (Figure\n2).\n\nCalifornia engineers consider a coating superior if it endures a\n\n3000-hour test (3% brine), whereas the paint industry places its test\nrequirement as high as 4000 hours.\n4\n\no\nc\no\n\nci \xc2\xab\n- \'-\'\nO \xe2\x80\x94\n\nr =\n\nx\no\na\n\ng\n\n^\n\nr\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(a)\n\nWITH VINYL ACETATE\nFINISH COAT\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\nFINISH COAT AND ZINC\nPRIMER REMOVED\n\nSAME AS (b), MAGNIFICATION 3X\nSA-3670-2\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nNASA\'s POTASSIUM SILICATE ZINC DUST COATING AFTER\n5300-HOUR SALT SPRAY TEST\xe2\x80\x94NO SIGN OF CORROSION\n\nMAGNIFICATION 3X\nSA-3670-8\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nNASA\'s POTASSIUM SILICATE ZINC DUST COATING\nAFTER 5300 HR SALT SPRAY TEST\n\nTests of Commercial Coatings\nFifty-nine zinc-rich coatings, all available commercially, vvere ex3\nposure tested at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).\nSeventeen were able to\nendure the 18-month test by completely resisting corrosion and adhering\n*\nuniformly;

L. Manta, President of J.L. Manta, Inc., a Chicago paint contractor,\nexpressed his opinion that the steel surface must be sandblasted white*\nclean (no stains, no pits, no grease or dirt) for the inorganic primer\nto adhere.\n\nManufacturers of inorganics contend that only a near-white\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2surface is required.\n\nThat is, the surface must be free of grease, dirt,\n\nand paint but may contain stains and mill scale binder.\n\nThe heavier the\n\nsteel, the harder it is to clean.\nWhen the sandblasting (or steel grit blasting) is done in the open,\nas is necessary for bridge members, a dry abrasive of uniform grain size\nis discharged through a nozzle outlet of specific size at a predetermined\npressure.\n\nWith a 3/8-inch-diameter\n\nnozzle and a 90-pound air pressure,\n\n3 to 6 ft/min. can be cleaned with 72 pounds of abrasive.\n\n*\nNACE (National Association of Corrosion Engineers) Standard No. 1\n\nt\nSteel Structures Painting Council Surface Preparation Specification\nNo. 10.\n\n15\n\nLike other-inorganics, the NASA coating is a two-component system.\nThe zinc dust must be combined with the binder at the site.\n\nThe mixing\n\nstep is eliminated by using air spray equipment that contains an agitator,\nThe spray gun should be held close to the structure so that coating is\nsprayed wet and zinc dust is not lost.\n\n.".\n\n.\n\nThe NASA coating is applied at a dry film thickness of 2-3 mils.\nOne gallon is reported to cover 375 square feet, whereas the usual coverage for inorganics is about 200 square feet per gallon.\n\nThe potassium\n\nsilicate binder appears to be easier to apply than the more common ethyl\nsilicate.\n\nIf necessary, a second coat or a topcoat may be applied after\n\n24 hours.\n\nComplete self-cure requires five days.\n\n16\n\nIll\n\nSUPPLIERS\n\nSuppliers of Raw Materials\nThe NASA coating contains three ingredients: zinc dust, potassium\nsilicate, and methyltrimethoxysilane (plus water for dilution).\n\nThe\n\nsupply of zinc dust is limited and may create some inconvenience.\n\n.\n\nSuppliers with assets over $100,000 are listed below.\n\nPacific Smelting, Torrance, California\nKraft Chemical Company, Chicago\nSipi Metals Corporation, Chicago\nBall Corporation, Muncie, Indiana\nAnchor Alloys, Inc., Brooklyn, New York\nBelmont Smelting & Refining Works, Brooklyn, New York\nNey Metals, Inc., Brooklyn, New York\nRepublic Metals Company, Brooklyn, New,York\nAmerican Smelting and-Refining Company, New York\nInternational Minerals & Metals Corporation, New York\nNew Jersey Zinc Company, New York\nPhillipp Brothers Chemicals, Inc., New York\nJ.

Towanda, Pennsylvania.\na deposit of $65 each is charged.\nrequired deposit would be $390.\n\nFor the returnable drums,\n\nThus, for 30 gallons (6 drums), the\n\nShipping costs are small but must be\n\nconsidered\xe2\x80\x94approximately $25 for 50 gallons by truck from Towanda,\n22\n\nPennsylvania, to Menlo Park, California, for example.\nThe cost of Dow Coming\'s methyltrimethoxysilane is $2.47 per pound\nin 37.5-pound lots.\n\nFor convenience, the lots may be broken down into\n\n1 and 2-pound cans.\nIn Table 7 , raw material costs are estimated for one gallon of\nNASA\'s potassium silicate/zinc dust coating.\n\nEquipment\nMost paints, which have a heavy weight and consistency, require\nan assortment of rugged machinery.\n\nEquipment recommended for a typical\n\nsmall paint plant manufacturing many types of paints and coatings\nincludes three mixers, three mills of different types, a high-speed\nagitator, twenty portable tanks, scales, and electric hoist, strainers,\n9\nfilling attachments, and conveyors.\nThe manufacture of zinc coatings is a simpler operation that can\nbe undertaken by a small business.\n\nUp to 2000 gallons/day of the NASA\n\ncoating can be manufactured with only a scale for measuring\na reaction tank with an agitator, and a hoist.\nrugged, and require little or no adjustment.\n\ningredients,\n\nThe scale must be

(approximately 2000 pounds)\nas quoted by Navajo Freight Lines in San Jose, California, are as follows:\nSan Francisco to Denver (approx. 1000 miles)\n\n$124.80\n\nSan Francisco to Houston (approx. 2000 miles)\n\n138.20\n\nSan Francisco to Phoenix (approx. 800 miles)\n\n105.00\n\nFrom these figures, an average shipping cost of $1.25 per gallon has been\nestimated.\n\nDelivery costs for the finished .product can be minimized by\n\nlocating plants at key points throughout the area to be served.\nFrom the supplier\'s standpoint, the paint industry is relatively\nfree of government regulation, at least in comparison with such industries\nas drugs or food.\n\nLabeling of paints is regulated by the U.S. Food and\n\nDrug Administration and by some states as well.\n\nThe Federal Housing\n\nAuthority and many local governments set specifications for the painting\n25\n\nof buildings.\nThe federal government is an important user of paints, generally bought\nunder one or more of the over 200 federal specifications on paints, pigments, or related products.\n\nAn index to these specifications with in-\n\nstructions for purchasing is issued annually, with a cummulative monthly\nsupplement: "index of Federal Specifications, Standards, and Handbooks,"\nGeneral Services Administration, Washington, D.C. 20402, U.S. Government\nPrinting Office.\n\nAnnual subscription (including monthly supplements)$1.50.\n\nThe National Paint, Varnish, and Lacquer Association also publishes a\nquarterly "Guide to U.S. Government Paint Specifications," available only\nto members.\n\nProduction Costs\nTo get started and make a first delivery of, say, 5000 gallons would\nrequire an investment of approximately $2000 for equipment, $46,200 for\nraw materials, $2100 for packaging and labeling materials, and $6250 for\nshipping and receiving, for a total of $56,550-\n\nSpread over a 50,000\n\ngallon production period (50 days at 1000 gallons per day), the equipment\ncost per gallon of coating becomes $0.04, and a total cost per gallon\nbecomes approximately$10.00 (see Tables ).\n\nLabor costs for mixing and\n\nhandling are estimated at 30\xc2\xa3 per gallon with overhead costs about twice\nthat amount.\nTo cover material, profit, labor and overhead costs, a competitive\nprice of $20-25 per gallon could be charged.\n\nThe latest quote for a\n\ncommercially available inorganic zinc-rich coating (January 1975) to the\nGolden Gate Bridge Authority was $35 per gallon.\n\nLocating the plant in\n\na low-cost neighborhood can reduce overhead costs.\n\nHowever, communities\n\nthat have low tax and utility rates should not be chosen if rail and truck\nfacilities are not convenient.\n\nConsideration should also be given to\n26\n\nTable

for this amount of stock is approximately 1000 square feet.\n\n28\n\nV\n\nBUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS\n\nSales Potential\nApplications for zinc-rich coatings have been identified with state\nhighway departments, utility companies, and railroads, particularly for\ncoastal operation, and with the maritime services and off-shore drilling\nfacilities.\nState highway departments want greater protection for coastal bridges,\nparticularly the large bridges that are difficult and expensive to paint.\nFor example, to coat the Golden Gate Bridge, which has 23,000 pounds of\nsteel per linear foot, approximately 5,000 gallons of inorganic zinc\nare needed.\n\nWith an estimated 500,000 highway bridges in the United\n\nStates averaging 2,500 gallons per bridge every 15 years, the total\nmarket could be 83 million gallons per year.\n\nCurrently, inorganic\n\ncoatings are being marketed by about twenty major paint companies.\n\nAt\n\n$24 per gallon, each company could gross $94 million per year on bridge\n*\ncoatings alone.\nU.S. utility companies plan to spend $6 billion on lines and equipment\nin the next few years, with paint (mostly zinc-rich) accounting for $3.5\nmillion.\n\nAccording to the Transportation Association of America, 228,550\n\nmiles of oil pipeline criss-cross the country in 1972, compared with\n204,064 miles in 1962.\n\nZinc-rich coatings are also being considered for\n\nprotection of nuclear reactors.\n10,000 gallons.\n\nEach unit will require approximately\n\nAlthough there are only about 45 nuclear reactors in\n\nthe United States at present, the number is.steadily climbing (forecast\nfor 1984: 140).\n\nIn short, public utilities are expected to have a siz-\n\nable impact on the zinc-rich coating industry during the next five to\nten years.\n*\nCurrent prices run as high as $43 per gallon.\n29\n\nThe railroads are looking at inorganics to coat their hopper cars.\nThe cars currently have a 40-year life, but the hopper walls become badly\ncorroded within 20 years from the abrasive action of the hopper contents.\nCar replacement costs $30,000; replacing the hoppers,costs $15,000.\n\nThere\n\nare approximately 400,000 hopper cars in the United States.\nTo increase hopper life, zinc coating on the walls is being considered.\nBecause of the abrasion factor, the hoppers may have to be recoated\nevery 5 years.\n\nAt about $500 per coating including labor costs, a con-\n\nsiderable saving could be achieved ($2,000 in 20 years compared with\n$15,000 for wall replacement).\nOff-shore drilling facilities are being coated with inorganics.\nEight years ago, Freeport Sulphur Company put two coats of a zinc silicate (or one coat of zinc silicate plus a coat of polyimide epoxy) on\n*\nits platform structures.\nA twenty-year life is forecast. The two-coat\nsystem replaces the original five coats of vinyl.\n\nEach facility con-\n\ntains close to a million square feet of surface to be coated, at approximately 100,000 square feet per year.\n\nThe petroleum/gas industry listed\n10\n12,000 offshore wells as of January 1974.\nA new vitality in American shipping has resulted in the addition\n(construction or conversion) of approximately 25 ships (cargo and\n\npassenger) per year.\n\nThe current fleet consists of more than 1400 vessels,\n\nboth government and privately owned.\n\nIn 1964, 10 million gallons of\n\npaint (primer and finish coat) were applied to ships.\n\nSince the size\n\nof reserve fleets decreased and then rebounded during the past ten years,\nthis gallonage may be about the same today.\n\nAs reported at the National Zinc-Coating Conference in Chicago,\nDecember 4-5, 1974.\n\n30\n\nNo long-term forecasts of production were found for inorganic zincs.\nHowever, Table 9\n\nprojects the market for the entire surface coating\n\nindustry (paints, varnishes, etc.) of which inorganic zincs are only a\nsmall percentage (less than 10%).\ncast is very conservative.\n\nCurrent trends indicate that the fore-\n\nTable 10,which shows the current demand for\n\ninorganic zinc-rich coatings, does not include the maritime market.\n\nCommercial Channels of Distribution\nZinc-rich coatings are used primarily by public utilities and the\npublic sector and are purchased in large quantities directly from the\nmanufacturer.\n\nLarge paint manufacturers have representatives in major\n\ncities.\nSince the NASA-developed coating faces competition from established\nbrands, its longer life and competitive price are not enough to assure\na market.\n\nTo enter the field successfully, a company probably should\n\nalready have some channels of distribution, e.g., previous connection\nwith highway, maritime, or public utility procurement.\n\nCompanies that\n\nare current suppliers of paints/coatings, batteries, nonferrous metals,\nand metallic pigments could probably enter the market readily. Distribution centers in several coastal areas are advisable.\n\nPatent Position\nNASA has been granted a patent for its potassium silicate/zinc dust\ncoating (U.S. Patent No. 3,620,784).\n\nRights to the patent may be licensed\n\n.through the Patent Counsel at Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 204,\nGreenbelt, Maryland\n\n20771.\n\nExclusive rights may be considered.\n\nNASA will assist in the transfer of this technology to interested\ncompanies.\n\nDiscussions may be held with NASA personnel as well as with\n\nthe SRI Technology Applications Team.\n31\n\nTable 9\nFORECAST DEMAND FOR SURFACE COATINGS\n(millions of gallons)\n\nTrade Sales\n\nIndustrial\n\n344\n\n319\n\n663\n\nLow\n\n327\n\n167\n\n494\n\nMedium\n\n373\n\n296\n\n670\n\nHigh\n\n471\n\n503\n\n974\n\nLow\n\n306\n\n302\n\n608\n\nMedium\n\n452\n\n653\n\n1105\n\nHigh\n\n945\n\n1377\n\n2322\n\nYear\n\nTotal\n\n1960\nActual\n\n1980\n\n2000\n\nSource:\n\nH.H.
