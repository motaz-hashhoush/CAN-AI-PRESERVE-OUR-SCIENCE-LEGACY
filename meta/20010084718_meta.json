However. theoretical models or large icosahedral fullerenes predict highly faceted shapes for molecules with more than a few hundred atoms. This discrepancy in shape may be explained by the presence of defects during the formation of carbon onions. Here, we use the semi-empirical tight-binding method for carbon to simulate the incorporation of pentagon-heptagon defects on to the surface of large icosahedral fullerenes. We show a simple mechanism that results in energetically competitive derivative structures and a global change in molecular shape from faceted to round. Our results provide a plausible explanation of the apparent discrepancy between experimental observations or round buckyonions and theoretical predictions of faceted icosahedral fullerenes.", "title": "Why are Buckyonions Round?", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T11:42:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20010084718, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bates, Kevin R."}, "organization": {"name": "Rice Univ.", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "6e05e856b77444a1b911eebbf90e5fe8"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20010084718, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Scuseria, Gustavo E."}, "organization": {"name": "Rice Univ.", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "0f9419ce505c4fff85221d227d0a3d7d"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20010084718, "publications": [{"volume": "99", "submissionId": 20010084718, "publisher": "Springer-Verlag", "id": "4715b92e20054509b5dabc17f9de69c7", "publicationName": "Theoretical Chemistry Accounts", "publicationDate": "1998-01-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
