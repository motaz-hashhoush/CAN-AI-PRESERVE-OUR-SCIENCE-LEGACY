This\nunit controls both the valving of the fuel and oxidizer to the engine combustion chamber\nand the ignition spark required for timely and efficient engine burns.\nIn addition to this basic function, the unit is designed to manage it\'s own redundancy\nsuch that it is still operational after two hard circuit failures. Further, it communicates to the data bus system several selected information points relating to the operational status of the electronics as well as the engine fuel and burning processes.\nThe system design represents a significant advance in the state-of-the-art of digital\ni\nsystems for NASA in that it proves out the feasibility of implementing Complimentary\nMOS circuitry both in discrete form or LSI form within the Shuttle vehicle control\nsystems. In addition, this implementation typically demonstrates the level of complexity\nrequired to acquire subsystem dual-failure immunity.\n2. 0\n\nDESIGN PHILOSOPHY\n\nThe underlying philosophy behind the circuits designed for the APS/DIU is that they\neasily be implemented into CMOS LSI with a minimum of documentation alterations.\nSeveral breadboard modules, in this case, could be incorporated within a single LSI\nchip where the two prime considerations are device density and I/O requirements.\nThis philosophy creates complexity in a breadboard system that would not otherwise be\nrequired if the system were merely constructed with discrete logic or passive\n\\\ncomponents. For example, a seven input NAND function is a simple part within a LSI\nchip and the addition of three inputs to a four input NAND layout occupies very little\n\nreal estate. However, a seven input gate was not available in CMOS during the\nfabrication of this breadboard and had,to be constructed from several devices. This\noccupies.-quite a bit .of breadboard real estate and is costly in that the excess gates\nwithin, the packages required to create the function are not always useful at the given\nlocation.\nTo minimize this costly approach, the breadboard was fabricated of pure CMOS where\ntiming and propogation considerations were of a critical nature. Here, the function\nmay be transferred directly to a LSI configuration with little or no logic alterations,,\nAn example of these designs are found in the Input Supervisory Validity Comparison and\nStatus Monitor Circuits.\nAlternately, where timing and propogation delays are not considered critical, discrete\ncomponents are used to compliment the use ofv additional logic thereby reducing complexities and cost. Several examples of this will be demonstrated in this report.\nFunctionally, the designs with discrete components perform identically to the pure\nlogic form desired.\n;\n3. 0\n\nAUXILARY PROPULSION ENGINE DIGITAL INTERFACE UNIT ELECTRICAL\nDESIGN\n\n3.1 SUMMARY OF ELECTRICAL DESIGN\nThe purpose of this breadboard has been to:\n(1) verify the feasibility and operational complexity of an APS/Dili\ncapable of dual-failure immunity\n\' (2) verify the feasibility and performance parameters of Complimentary\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ,-f..-,\nMOS. logic in performing this function.\n3.1.1\n\nFunctional Complexities\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTo complete these tasks, the circuits were fabricated using CMOS on plug-in cards\nwhich were rack-partitioned within a commercial bench style cabinet. The circuits\nwere partitioned both according to module function as well as a redundant function. Here,\n\ninter changeability is maintained as universal as possible for performance evaluation ;. \xe2\x80\xa2\nand troubleshooting. Where simplicity dictated that\'a specific function and it\'s re- \xe2\x80\xa2 ->:\ndundant\'couhterparts should be mounted on the same module, it was done so. Here,\'" \' \xe2\x80\xa2\ntesting and observation can be accomplished by placing the card on an extender card. \'\nEach module is powered in accordance with the partitioning of the redundancy scheme.\nThat is, ftir example, Line Receiver "A" in position "A" is powered by:"A" power; supply.\nIt would be, however, capable of performing in the Lme Receiver "B" position in which\ncase it would become Line Receiver "B", Exceptions to this arrangement are found on.\ncertain modules where single-failure majority voting is accomplished. Here, the:\npower supplies are "ORed" to preempt a prime power failure reducing the majority\nvoting capability.\nThe module back plane wiring uses a point-to-point scramble scheme intended to reduce\ncross-coupling capacity between signal paths. The power wiring is the only shielded - \xe2\x80\xa2< \xe2\x80\xa2\nwiring in the system and the shields are intended to reduce the coupling\'from the \' \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 \'\ncurrent-carrying lines to the high-impedance signal lines. Because the system is\xc2\xaba ; :\nbreadboard by definition, no attempt to create cables was made since their formation\nwould, in most probability, be detrimental to the system performance\'. \'\nThe architecture of the system breadboard is, at best, a very poor representation of\nan LSI type construction. The signal paths, for instance, are measured an feet insteadof mils as would be the case on a chip. Nevertheless,, if the devices perform the\n,. ,\nfunctions desired within this architecture, obviously the design would operate in an\nLSI configuration. A computer verification of the shorter propogation delays in the\nLSIlayout is all that is required to confirm nominal .operation.. In additipn,, the breadboard architecture offers a circuit exposure to radiant noise that most certainly would\nnot exist in the LSI format. Again, the natural immunity of the circuit designs to noise\nproblems is demonstrated and assured to improve in the conversion to LSI. . ,The philosophy of dual-failure immunity would include.not only active device redundancy\nbut signal path redundancy to protect against.such failures as broken wires or failed .\n\nconnectors: \xe2\x80\xa2\' The breadboard does not include the, signal path redundancies. The\nthinking here was that the signal path wiring redundancy would do nothing to verify\nthe functional redundancies of the logic and would merely complicate the logic boards\nand back-plane system. "And; the multitude of additional redundant wiring would not\nnecessarily be representative of the signal paths within an LSI system due to the\npartitioning of the breadboard. Broken wires, failed solder or wirewrap connections\nor interrupted connector connections should be relatively easy to locate and repair\nwithin the breadboard\'should they occur. .-; . \xe2\x80\xa2\n3.1.2\n\nPerformance of CMOS Logic\n\nWithin the architecture discussed, the CMOS logic devices selected performed well\nbeyond ECI\'s expectations. Because they are very high impedance devices, we had\nexpected to witness rather severe noise pickup from sources different from the APS/DIU\nas well as internal crosstalk and interference. This did not happen, in spite of the fact\nthat virtually all of the signal lines within the breadboard are excessive in length. The\nsystem frequency limit is just about two megahertz because some pulse shape deterioration was witnessed at these frequencies. This deterioration, however, was not\nsevere enough to inhibit the desired performance.\nPerhaps the most severe problem that has existed in the application of CMOS,was the\ndifficulty in turning it off. Because of the input protective diode network, the logic will\nperform it\'s natural function with the presence of an input signal. Here, the input\nsignal will provide power for the logic Vcc while not deteriorating the quality of the\nsignal pulse characteristics. Now, to test a specific logic function where several\nsimilar functions are in parallel to provide the redundancy, the obvious method would\nbe to power down .the logic functions in sets and verify that the remaining sets still\nperform as expected. Disconnecting power does not work in this case. Instead, the\ninput circuits had to be resistively isolated and the power lines of the specific function\npulled to ground. The resistive isolation was such that it did not load the desired inputs\nto the active redundant circuits.\n.\n\nAn alternate method that resultantly was not ideal for the breadboard,, was to open the r *\nsignal inputs with logic switches. Here, each input (signal/ clock, etc.) would have to.-,,\nhave a series switch to interrupt signal and a parallel switch to commit the opened .\ninput. This method, although feasible, is not practical. The switches increase cost\ncomplexity plus add a series element subject to failure.;\n.\n,\n:-\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2.\xe2\x80\xa2\nRe-evaluation of this method .will be conducted, however, for an LSI fabrication to ;\nassess its impact on reliability and cost. On a LSI chip, only the inputs would necessarity have this network whereas on the breadboard every input-per-package is\nprotected.\n,-.-> .... .. ,\n; ,<\n3.2\n\nSYSTEMS FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThis section describes the operation of the APS/DIU as depicted in the Functional\nBlock Diagramj Figure 1.\n,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 - . .\n\xe2\x80\xa2-.\xe2\x80\xa2..;. \',.- .\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\xa2/\n; , , \xe2\x80\xa2:,\nThe data inputs to the APS/DIU from a Data Terminal which communicates with the\nvehicle data bus/ The format of this information is 20 bits Polar RZ with the 2Qth bit\nmissing for word synchronization.

This -;\nfeature eliminates any contradictions of redundant command paths and insures that any ,\ngiven command is sourced from a (virtual) single source. Table I lists the specific \xe2\x80\xa2\'\ncommands for the APS/DIU and their encoded format. ,\n3.2.2\n\nFiring Logic\n\n,\n\nThe firing logic sections are configured in triplicate such that a failure in "A" automatically causes switchover to "B" and a failure in "B" causes automatic switchover to\n"C. " The Firing Logic that is in use is the only one that is powered "on. " The others\nare powered down until activated either automatically or by external commando\n-\'\nThe system initiates itself into Firing Logic "A" at "power-on;" And, it will remain\nthere until it fails. < K its failure mode is such that it cannot (or itSfassociated drivers\ncannot) operate the valve, then the switchover will occur the* first time an "engine-on"\ncommand is issued. If its failure mode is such that it attempts to issue an uncommanded\n"engine-on", then the switchover occurs immediately., Similarly, if "B" has an inert\nfailure as described.for "A", switchover to "C" will occur at the next "engine-on"\ncommand.

Each .. , \xe2\x80\xa2.\ndriver contains a "modulate" stage plus two stage of series inhibit to disable the .\ndriver in the event of two shorting failures. The three drivers within, for, example,\nthe Valve Driver are in parallel but operate singly with a given Firing Logic set. .This\nis true also for the Spark Driver.\n.\n;\nBoth drivers are identical in structure and components with exception to the currentmeasuring resistors which restrict the Valve Driver to 50 ma output while the Spark\nDriver output is 1 ampere. This was intentionally done for this breadboard to demonstrate the versatility of the circuit and to provide for loads which were undefined during\nthis program. It was assumed, therefore, that the valve would require 50 ma and the\ncurrent-monitoring resistors would swing 0 to 1 volt for this load. Similarly, the\n;\nspark was assumed to be 1 amp and the current monitor would also indicate 0 to 1,volt. .\nThese currents are continually monitored by A/D converters and can be accessed.at\ni\nany time for information reporting to the data bus system.\n\'.\n..\n3.2.4\n\nHigh Voltage Supply\n\n,\n\n.\n\n;\n\nThe High Voltage Supply illustrated in the block diagram is for information purposes\nonly in describing the system and is not part of the APS/DIU. /This supply provides\nspark for the engine combustion chamber.\n.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xab \xe2\x80\xa2\n.\n3o2o5\n\nEmergency Shutoff Monitor\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe function of this device is to close the additional valve shown in the event of a\nj\ncatastrophic failure not self-correctable by the APS/DIU. The monitor compares the \xe2\x80\xa2\nchamber and line pressure thresholds, the spark and valve outputs from the drivers\n:\nand the s state of the valve switches.

Monitors. The ESO Monitor seeks uncommanded and undriven engine\nreactions. The Function Monitors seeks faulty commands which were not dictated to\nthe APS/DIU0 The ESO monitor may cause shutdown of the Firing Logics depending\non the conditions but the Function,Monitors will never cause Emergency shutoff.\n3.2.6\n\nStrain Gauge Amplifiers\n\n, :.\n\n,\n\n. ,\n\nThese amplifiers are analog interfaces with the pressure transducers located in the\nGH2 and GO2 fuel lines plus the engine combustion chamber. The original intent of the\nsystem design was that these amplifiers interface with redundant strain gauge pressure\ntransducers.. However, for purposes of this breadboard, at least, the triplex sets\ninterface, with a single transducer for each of the monitoring points. The breadboard\nis configured such that either configuration may be employed with minimum adjustment\nto the circuitry., ,.In addition,; each amplifier set is presently oriented to interface with\na single strain.gauge with the bridges configured on the breadboard. Alternate types\nof pressure transducers may be substituted by eliminating the bridge circuitry and rescaling the amplifiers.\nIt is the function of these amplifiers to monitor the specific pressures at their designated\npoints and.report .this information both to the threshold detectors and the A/D converters.\nHere, both the nominal performance and "graceful degradations" can be monitored.\n3. 2. 7 Pressure Threshold Detectors and A/D Converters\nThe Pressure Threshold Detectors yield a binary "go, no-go" indication of the pressure\nstatus. .Their intent is to permit the engine to be on-line and operational with some\ngiven degradation bounds. Outside of these bounds, the system will shut down.\nThe A/D Converters with 8-bit accuracy yield a continual measurement of the linear\ncharacteristics of these pressure measurements. Here, this information may be\nreported to the, data bus (upon request) and analyzed for specific pressures nominal\nor degraded. In addition, there are A/D converters provided to monitor the\n\n10\n\nperformance of both the Spark and Valve Drivers. As will be detailed later in this ,\' ::\nreport, several items of information are yielded here, such as transistor leakage, etc.;\nbesides the measured "on" and "off" currents.:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\'.\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\',\xe2\x80\xa2:\nThe converters employed are "tracking" A/D converters and 8-bits were selected to\nyield 0 to 5 V nominal scaling with 40 mv accuracy at the LSB. They may be accessed\nasynchronously at any time except during the 2 //sec clocking period.\n\'\n3.2.8\n\nStatus .Monitor\n\n,\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 . . . . \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe function of this section is to collect the status information from the A/D converters,\nvarious binary points such as the Power Enable/Disable circuits and the Test Sequencer\nand report it to the Data Bus Terminal upon requests Table I listed the input commands\nto the APS/DIU and of these, ten commands are status request commands including the\nself-test command. (See Table II.) These commands set up the Status Monitor Timing\nand Control function and adjust the multiplexers to view the requested information. The\ndata is parallel loaded to the registers and serially shifted to the Data Terminal through\nthe Polar RZ modulators 40 usec after the initial request.\n:\xe2\x80\xa2\'->.;\nThe Status Monitor is a straightforward quad system with no intervoting required. The\nsystem depends on the voting mechanisms at the Data Terminal to overcome any two\nfailures that may occur in this area.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 .\xe2\x80\xa2 ,.\n3.2.9\n\nTest Sequencer\n\n.\n\n;.\n\nIt is the purpose of the Test Sequencer to verify the internal redundancies of the\'\nAPS/DIU and report these statuses to the data bus.

The firing logics are also\nstimulated and the outputs monitored for proper operation while the drivers are inhibited\nand tested for shorts and/or opens. Similarly, the Strain Gauge Amplifiers and the\nFunction Monitors are stimulated to verify their performance.\nAs the various tests are sequenced, the performance is stored in a series of two-bit\ncodes to formulate a 16-bit word indicating the total test results. With proper performance on all circuits, the 16-bit word is all zeros. At the end of the test the status .\nword is automatically loaded into the Status Monitor and shifted to the Data Terminal.\nIn appearance, the "self-test" command is issued to the.APS/DIU,, Several seconds\npass and the next activity out of the unit is an automatic status word indicating the test\nresults. The APS/DIU will not accept any commands during this test activity. And,\nregardless of its redundancy configuration prior to the self-test cycle, the system .will\nautomatically reset itself back into its prime mode of operation.\nFor example, if the unit has failed in its attempt to use Firing Logic "A" in the normal\noperating mode and has proceeded to use "B" continually, the system will be reset back\nto Firing Logic "A" following a "self-test" command. However, because "A" is, in\nfact, failed, switchover to "B" will occur as soon as the "A" set is tried. The unit will\nthen continue to use "B" as it did prior to the self-test cycle.\n\n13\n\n3. 3 MODULE DESIGNS\nThis section will detail and discuss the specific operation in each of the APS/DIU\nbreadboard modules. The modules are oriented and constructed for versatility within\nthe breadboard architecture and are not to be construed as a typical LSI chip design.\nBecause of the high densities possible on an LSI chip, several of these schematics can\nbe incorporated into one package.\nThe boards that are listed are identified by number both on the schematic and in the\nbreadboard system itself. Some numbers-do not appear and this is either, because they\nhave been designated to the Actuator Interface Digital Interface Unit or they have been\neliminated due to a design change. Board No, 1,\'the Supervisory Command Comparator,\nhas been eliminated from the original systems design. The board coordinate system is a straightforward layout defined in Figure 1-A. Each\nboard is capable of holding 24 sockets although only those required for a given circuit\nwere used. All of the sockets used were 16 pin although in many cases only 14 pin\ndevices were used. Where 14 pin devices were used, the pins 8 and 9 of the socket\nwere not counted and the remaining 14 pins were counted for device correspondence, as\nshown in the illustration. These coordinates are labeled for each device on the\nschematics discussed in this section.\n3,3.1\n\nSupervisory Parity Checker; Board No. 2 (Figure 2)\n\nThis circuit is,;comprised of a parallel tree of exclusive OR\'s which monitors the 19 bits\nof information stored in the parallel storage registers. The parallel tree was constructed\nto minimize the propagation delay experienced between the. time that the new information\nis entered and the validating state is set at the output. Valid parity enables the decoders\n(reference Figure 1).\nThere are two parity checkers per board with separate power inputs for each. However,\nboth are operated from the same supply .(A; B, C or D)-and one checker .monitors a one\'s\nregister while the other monitors the corresponding zeros register.\n\n14\n\nPIN I\n\nA\n^ Plu 22.\nftU Z\n\n\xc2\xa3Aai?

The\nscheme is oriented td eliminate any two hard-failed or floated inputs by reducing this :\nindication to a single\'line within the first level of majority voters. The second level of\nmajority voters performs a bit-correction operation such that the summed outputs are ;\nall in the correct state. Above this, the module in itself is immune to two device .\nfailures. Open \\ resistors at the output will not contribute any degradation to the ;\nsignal state. Shorted output gates (two) will deteriorate the output logic level by 25% : ,\nwhich leaves a 25% margin of additional level certainty. Two wrong states at the out- :\nputs of the first level of majority voters could not result in more than two wrong states\nat the summing resistor inputs resulting in, again a 25% degradation.\n3.3.3 Serial Voter; Board No. 4 (Figure 4)\n\n;\n\nThis circuit provides bit correction and correlation from four different but simultaneous\nserial inputs to four separate outputs.\nA set of four majority voters views the input signals in four sets of three each and outputs corrected data against a single incorrect input each. Where two inputs to a\nmajority voter are in some hard failure mode (high, low or open), there is no contribution to the RC summingnetwork by that majority voter. Two majority voters may either\nfail or view two failed inputs and the summing network will still provide corrected data\nto the four recovery/driver output gates.\n:\n(1) Open resistors are considered the prime resistor failure mode in the APS/DIU\ndesigns. Within a final package employing LSI techniques, most of these resistors\nwill necessarily be thin film deposit resistors. Shorted thin film or metal film resistors is about 0. 01% of the probability of an open failure mode. To additionally protect\nagains the short failure mode, series resistors may be added which increas the\n[\nprobability of an open failure mode. It is, therefore, reasonable to ignore the shorting\nfailure mode because of its low impact on system reliability.\n\n17\n\nw\n\n(6\nW\nEH\nO\n\nH\nHH\n\nOQ\n\nCO\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nCO\n\nW\n\n; 18\n\no3\n\nI\nI\n\nLJ\n\nor\no\n<-> i\no%\n\nLJ_\n\nz\xc2\xb0\n\n2\'\nCC.\no\n\no%\n\no\no\no\n\ntf\nw\n\nH\n\no\n\ns\n\nCO\n\nO\n\n$. >\n\nVj \xc2\xbbj V\n\ny\n\nQ Q ^^ .\n^ o -y * o \xe2\x80\xa2"ft ^\n\nO 3\n\n> \xe2\x80\xa2> ^ ^r \xc2\xab ^\nI,\nHj Uj lu Ui\n^ - Oi oa 3- >\n\n5| \xc2\xa3\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n;\n\n19\n\nThis circuit takes decided advantage of the 50% switching characteristics of CMOS\nlogic devices. A bias network is added to the inputs of the recovery gates such that\nthey may operate at lower input logic swings than normally required. The output gates\nare paralleled to provide additional drive to the lines within the breadboard.\nThe;circuit will :pei|form with no noted changes in the output if two of the input lines\nare shorted to ground, tied high, combined high and low or have different interfering\nsignals of any frequencies. Two sets of different signals cause considerable confusion\n; because the circuit cannot determine which two are correct.\n3.3.4 : Supervisory Serial and Storage Registers; Board Nos. 6 & 7 (Figure 5)\nThis schematic illustrates two types of similar boards, one for the 1\'s information and\n;one for ; the ; 6\'s information. The difference is in the information taken off of the\nstorage; elements XQ of Q)o\n.\nThe clock and data are buffered coming on to the board (not needed in LSI format) and\nthey feed a 19 bit serial register. .The "parallel transfer" input is, in fact, the "end. of-word" pulse detected within the System Clock Generator and this pulse loads the\ninputted data into the storage elements.\nThe information remains in storage for 20 microseconds while the next word (or "allzero "pattern) is shifted in.\n:\nOf the 19 bits shown outputted, only 8 bits are employed in the APS/DIU breadboard.\nThis added capability is provided in the event that there are changes to the system\n.requirements.\n<\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \' , \' . \'\n\n.\n\nThe serial data input is buffered by two parallel buffers and feeds a 40 K resistor which\nis in series with the input to the shift register.

Each polar RZ driver has a transistor configuration\non its output such that in the "one" state, one side of the line is tied to +5 while the\n;\nother is tied to ground. In the "zero" state, the opposite line is tied to +5 while its\nalternate is grounded. During the "no-data" state, both output lines are open. The waveforms are shown on the schematic.\n.\n.\n,\n\'\n3.3olO\n\nLine Receiver-Photo Isolator Interface Circuit; Board No. 18 (Figure 11)\n\n.\n\nThis circuit provides the isolation and data recovery from each line that inputs to the\nISVC circuits. The primary of the board is powered separately from the remainder of\nthe APS/DIUo Two comparators sense the "ones" and "zero\'s" separately and drive\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nphoto-isolator diodes. The network on the output of the photo-diodes provides both gain\nand high speed recovery of the bit waveshapes. The diode network along with the biasing configuration at the input of the output comparator, provides temperature compensation for the temperature characteristics of the photo-diode.\n:\n\'\n:\n\n27\'\n\n\xc2\xa7\nQ\nO\nN\n\no\ni\xe2\x80\x94i\nH\n\n28\n\n!\n--4\n\ncr\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\nii *< <Sj \xc2\xa7\n:?\n^ fc\n51 \xc2\xa7 S\n\nOQ^\n\no\no\n\n1\n\n^S ^\n^ ^\n\n= 0\n\ng;\nio ; i s s 25S\nS\n\nO\n\nH\n\n\xc2\xa7\nft\n\ntf\n\nw\nH\nO\n\nw\n\nW ;\nO i\n*-H\n\n29\n\nThe photo-isolating concept utilized in this circuit is not a new or difficult circuit to\ndesign.. However,\'.making a photo-isolator perform consistently throughout the temperature; of T55\xc2\xb0C to .+ 125\xc2\xb0C is difficult because of the photo-diode characteristics at\n+ 125\xc2\xb0C. As a result, this circuit became more complex than is "reasonable" for its\nfunction. An industry search reveals that other materials (different from the gallieum\narsenide jused in:thesMCD-4) were being investigated for application in photo-isolation\nand devices should be available during the last quarter of 1972. The circuit developed\nfor the APS/DIU proves the feasibility of this technique; better devices would certainly\nreduce, the\'functional complexity.\n.\n3, 3. li\n\nSystem Clock Generator; Board No. 19 (Figure 12)\n\nThe function of this circuit is to extract the clock information from the data that is inputted\'to; the APS/DIUc Since there is an all "zero" input when no data is present, the\nclock will be continuous. The data coming out of both sides of the Line Receivers is\neither a "one" or \'.\'zero" and these are Ored at the input to each clock generator in\ndirect correspondence A, B,\'-Cj and D.\nThe leading edges are detected at the output of the Or circuit by a logic differentiator\nwhich is jcapacitively timed to yield a 250 nanosecond pulse per each data bit. These\nclock pulses are buffered and outputted off the board. They also feed a "missing-pulse"\ndetector circuit comprised of a driver, diode and RC circuit. Here, the 20th bit slot is\nidentified and this pulse is shaped by another logic differentiator timed to 500 nanoseconds\nand labeled "End-of-Word" pulse.,\n3. 3.12\n\n(Dual) Tracking Analog-to-Digital Converter; Board No. 20 (Figure 13)\n\nThere are two A/D converters per board as detailed in the schematic. The schematic\nlists the dual coordinates for the components required.\nThe A/D converter is oriented to convert a \xc2\xb15 volt analog input to an 8-bit digital number\nin two\'s complement form. The converter will track the input by counting either up or\ndown depending on the relative polarity of the input to the feedback amplifier.

The 9th bit or LSB continues to complement with each clock pulse as\ndoes the up/down count mode once the A/D converter has reached equilibrium.\n;\nThe input clock is 12. 5 Kc with a clock pulse width approximately 2 microseconds. This\npermits maximum access time to the converter and eliminates the clocking effect of \xe2\x80\x94\ncomparator oscillations when the A/D converter is on the near-edge of equilibrium. >\n3.3.13 Emergency Shutoff Monitor; Board No. 21 (Figure 14)\nThis circuit is one of two boards cpmprising the Emergency Shutoff Monitor. Here, the\nlogic, in triplex, seeks several faults which are unique to the engine itself and causes\nclosure of the Emergency Shutoff Valve. The faults include (1) an uncommanded engine\nburn which is detected either by sensing unwarranted chamber pressure or a closure in\nthe engine-valve switches; (2) a drop in line pressure accompanied by a closure in the\nengine-valve switches which is also not commanded.\n.... .\n;\nThese conditions are sensed andORed at the circuit output in three sets of. three NOR\ngates. Each set of NOR gates will feed a separate series driver inBoard No. 22.\nAs is shown on the schematic, the inputs to this board use resistive isolation to the\ninputs to each gate. This is to isolate similar circuits which operate from the same\n:\nsource such that any two inputs may assume a failure mode (shorted high or low) without\ndisturbing the logic level of the input to the third input.\n3. 3.14\n\nEmergency Shutoff Monitor; Board No. 22 (Figure 15)\n\nThis board receives as its inputs, the decisions made on Board No. 21 and the external\n\n33\n\n\xc2\xa7\nEH\n\nfa\no\nH\n\no\nw\n*\n\nw\no\n\n34\n\nw\nJ.\n\nO\'\n\n\xc2\xa3\na\no\n\nCO\n\nO\n\nAAAAAAAA/^AAAAAA^A/\n\nW\nO\n\ntf\nw\nw\nin\nTH\n\nw\n\n35\n\ncommand for e\'mergency shutoff; Again, the logic and drivers are configured in triplex/\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 ^\nparallel to provide; dual failure immunity.\nThe emergency shutoff and reset commands from the "Input Data Validity Comparison"\ncircuitry feed a triplex set of three latches. The latches feed a set of CD 4010\'s which\nare used for CMOS-to-TTL conversion for both the external commands and the information fed in from Board No. 21. These data are ORed in TTL 5412\'s which are opencollector gates used to control the drivers. Each driver set is comprised of three NPN\ntransistors gated on essentially in parallel (but by different sources) which drive a set\nolPNP transistors in, series. Here, all three inputs must be identical to turn the\ndriver^ "on" which protects a driver set against two shorted transistors. ,As shown,\nthere are three jdriver sets in parallel which protect against two open-failed transistors.\nDuring "Self-Test" the Emergency Shutoff Monitor is inhibited both on Board No. 21 and\nBoard\'NOo 22. On Bpard No 22, it is inhibited at the latches such that ESO does not\nget activated during*\'the input circuit tests.\n3:3.15 ,-.

J The two inhibit inputs\nset the latches to the "off" state and are, in fact, the "use Firing\nLogic \'B\'" and "use Firing Logic \'C\'" commands.

The resultant states are ORed in Cl, C2 and C3 simultaneously. Here, a\none-shot is triggered and ANDed with the one-shot input signal after it has passed\n. .\nthrough some delay gates.\nThe purpose of the one-shot is to create an inhibit-time to block out sensing the difference\nbetween the valve and spark pulses and the difference between when the ignition is commanded and actual chamber pressure is detected. The test is, then, a kind of "reasonableness" test to verify that the system is performing approximately as expected. The\none-shot inhibit time is approximately 15 milliseconds.\nIf a failure were to occur, it would be detected within 15 milliseconds of turn-on command\nand the majority voting quad-transistors would output a "low" to the Power Enable/Disable\nlogic to disable that Firing Logic set.\n.. \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e " \xe2\x80\xa2 ;.\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 .-.-,.Two failures that would majority-vote to cause a disable signal would eliminate that\nFiring Logic set and turn on the next backup.

Then, in an additional 10\nmilliseconds, it turns off the ignition pulse. If it is permitted to time-out to 50 milliseconds, the valve pulse will remain on for 50 milliseconds.and then it.is turned off\nwhile the ignition pulse "stays on for an additional 10 milliseconds. Figure 21 illustrates\nthis timing.\n, - ?\nAlthough this relative valve and spark timing is subject to change, the thinking was to\ninsure that burning would start by initiating the spark prior to the entry of fuel and\nmaintaining that spark until after the valves were closed, insuring complete burning\nwithout wetting the spark points. This insures that each burn cycle is initiated with\nd r y points.\n. , . . - . ,,.....\n........\n.\' "-. -v- \'\xe2\x80\xa2 -. i\n\nFunctionally, the process begins with the 20 microseconds "on" command being received\non pin 6. This sets latch E1/E2 which also sets latch B1/D2 to turn on the "spark" pulse.\nThe change-in-state of latch E1/E2 is detected by the logic differentiator D1/E2/E2 to\ntrigger the one-shot (10 ms) C2/C1. The end of the one-shot period is detected by the\nlogic differentiator B1/B1/B1 which creates a pulse that is NANDed in gate A2(9). This\nsets latch A1/A2 to begin the valve pulse.\nNow, the valve and spark pulses continue until a turn-off command is received at the\nlatch E1/E2 either by ISVC command or by automatic turn-off as timed out by the\ncounter E3/D3/C3.\nOnce the latch E1/E2 \'is reset, the logic differentiator D1/D1/D1 senses this change\nand re-triggers the one-shot. The logic differentiator B1/B1/B1 recognizes the end of\nthe one-shot period and resets the valve pulse la\'tch A1/A2. This delays the turn-off of\nthe valve the same amount of time that it was delayed in turn-on. The logic differentiator\nA1/A1/A1 recognizes that the valve pulse latch Was reset and it steers another trigger\n\n46\n\n\xc2\xa32-Z\nD2-6\n\nSfAtlC\nC2-3\n\n10 ms\n\ni\nVAIVS\n\nI"*"\n\n50 *s\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2IT\nSPAKK\nVAIM?\n\nTbfiti -GIF\n\nCOMMAUbEb\nFIGURE 21.\n\nFIRING LOGIC TIMING\n\n47.\n\npulse back to the one-shot. Again, a one-shot pulse is generated and detected by\nB1/B1/B1. , the last differentiator pulse then resets the spark latch B1/D2. The \'\nstring of inverters B2 delays the change-in-state of the valve pulse latch from reaching\ngate D2; until a^ter the one-shot pulse has been restarted.\nIn review, the one-shot ;C2/C1 is used to generate three time delays for each engine\nfiring; the first to delay the valve-on T amount after spark has beenturned on; the\nsecond to delay valve^off T amount to maintain proper valve duration; and the third to\nturn-off the spark T amount after the valve has been turned off.\nTo^keep the: engine "on" full time, a command must be received more frequently than\n50 ms to inhibit the automatic turn-off.\n3,3.18 Chamber;Pressure Amplifier/Comparator and A/D Converter;\nBoard No. 26, (Figure 22)\nThis circuit monitors the Chamber Pressure Transducer with an internal strain gauge\nassumed to have a nominal resistance of 511 ohms.

The\'scaling, then is set based on 1 volt across IK or 1 ma; SK\'at 1 ma is\n5 volts which is the .\'input to the A/D Converter.\n\n50.-\n\n51\'-\n\n3. 3. 20 Line-Pressure Amplifier/Comparator; Board No. 30 (Figure 24)\nThe function of this circuit is to monitor pressure transducers which indicate fuel and\noxidizer line pressures. As with the previously discussed Chamber Pressure Amplifier,\na strairi-guage nominal value of 511 ohms was assumed and the amplifiers are nominally\nscaled at approximately 1 volt per 10 ohm change. And, as before, the amplifiers feed\nA/D Converters and the comparators shown.\nFunctionally, the circuit senses a drop in pressure below some acceptable level yet to\nbe, definted.\' However, once the comparators sense this drop, the information is fed to\nthe Emergency Shutoff Monitor to disable the engine. The ESO data is the outputs of the\nNOR gate\'sjpl,; B2 and B3. The remaining gates are used for inverters which feed the\nbinary\' status to the status monitor for reporting to the data bus.\nThe logic records hard failure states and the A/D Converters Monitor slower degradation.\n3.3.21 ;A/t).Clocks; Board No. 31 (Figure 25)\nThe function of this board is to provide a 12. 5 KHz clock for the tracking A/D Converters.\nTherelare three generators each sensing a different "end-of-word" source at 50 KHz\nand each divides this frequency by 4. Pulse shaping is accomplished with an RC circuit\nfeeding-the inverters ;D1, D2 and D3 such that the pulse width is approximately two (2)\nmicroseconds. The remaining gates are used in a buffer configuration for driving the\nlines to the A/D Converters.\nIn addition, there is inter-synchronization added between the three generators using\n150 pf capacitors cross-coupled to the reset lines of the flip-flop dividers.\' This insures\nthat one of the generators becomes "command" and that the remaining will slavesynchronize. It is academic which generator has command or that synchronization truly\nexist. The feature was added for test arid monitoring convenience,,\n3.3.22 Status Monitor Timing and Control; Board No. 32 (Figure 26)\nThis circuit both enables the Status Monitor Multiplexers and sets up the timing for outputting the Status Monitor,word selected to the Polar RZ Modulators.\n\n52\n\no\nu.-\n\n\'<\nft\nw\nCQ\n\nw\'\n(Si\n\no\n\nO\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\nCQ\n\nffi\n\nO\n.\n(M\n\nW\n\n53 ;\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nO\n\nw\n\n1\n0\n(M*\n\no\n\nS\no\np\n\nW\n\n54\n\nThe Status Monitor word request command inputs to the inverters as shown on the\nschematic from the ISVC circuitry.

This loads the informa-\xe2\x80\xa2 :\ntion into the Status Monitor serial registers of Board 14. With this event, a two bit\ncounter is enabled which counts off 40 microseconds or two "end-of-word" cycles.\n;\nWhen\'XI and X2 of D4 reach the states of low-high respectively, the Status Monitor\n\\\nclocking and Polar RZ clocking trains are developed,, These are used to shift the data\nout. The end of this event is decoded to reset the B1/B1 latch back to the standby state. >\nAn alternate mode is operated during the "Self-Test" sequence of the APS/DIU. Because!\nthe self-test sequence does iterate all the system commands, the Status Monitor Timing\nand Control module must ignore this function or all status words would be outputted.\nConsequently, the B2/C1 latch recognizes the self-test command and is armed to inhibit ;\nlatch B1/B1 from reacting to the self-test generated words.\nOnce the self-test is complete, a status word is available at the multiplexer and the\nTest Sequencer issues a "load/send" pulse to the Status Monitor. At this time, the\nregisters are loaded and latch B1/B1 initiates the send cycle as before.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe inverters E3 that output to pin S shape up the clock pulses to the registers and the ;\nC2 X-OR gate and additional E3 inverters provide sufficient delay, along with the dioderesistor-capacitor network to the C3 inverters to provide the Polar RZ clock.

The results are (or\nshould be) a series of decoded commands providing the ISVC circuits are performing\ncorrectly.\n..\nAs these commands are iterated, the Subroutine Word Test Read Logic verifies that\neach word appears as it should and that there is only one command at that time, (a ,,\xe2\x80\xa2\nsingle \'zero\', in a field of one\'s). As the commands are generated by an address counter\non the Subroutine Control Logic, Board No. 36, the shift register X3 is clocked while\nthe gate logic of XI and X2 decode the states of bits 4 and 5 of the address counter. The\ncombinations of these outputs are NANDed in the test gates such that there is correspondence in the \'zero\' out of the test gates with each \'zero\' sensed at the wojg input.\nThat iSj test I/word; 1, test 2/word 2, etc.\nFor a.continuous normal operation, the outputs of the Exclusive-ORs will remain at\nzero during the word test time.

As with the rest of the Test Sequencer logic, this board only operates\nduring the "self-test" exercise and, in fact, it is powered down at all other times.\nThe control memory receives its clocking information from the Test Sequencer Timing\nand Control logic, Board No. 35.

In addition, there is an initial-;\nizer circuit that is active during APS/DIU power "on" and end-of,-test. This initializes\nthe unit such that Firing Logic "A" is on and insures that the Redundancy Override\nReset has been issued to reset the power interrupt circuits to their normal configuration.\nUpon receipt of the "self-test" command, latch D1/D1 sets such that Dl-6 is high which\nenables the Test Sequencer power supply. In addition, the positive transition at this\ntriggers the mono stable Cl. This one-shot outputs a pulse of approximately 100 milliseconds which is used for the "initial reset" of all the Test Sequencer functions. (Note\nthat the timing elements are slow and, at times, .appear to be randomly selected. Some\nare. The timing is configured to be sufficient to do the operation without approaching\nthose time-increments where propogation, response time, etc., become interfering\nproblems; 100 milliseconds, for instance is a long time for reseting logic devices;\nhowever, it allows sufficient time for the power supply to stabilize before any test\n\n63\n\no\ntfH\n\xc2\xa3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa20\n\nu\n\nQ\nO\n\nw\no\n^\nw\n.cy.\nw"\nOT\n\nH"\nCQ\n\n^\n\nH\no\n\nCO\n\nW\n\n64,\n\nsequences are started. Further, there is no real requirement for exercising the selftest sequence "in a hurry.")\n;; ,\n!\n\nAfter the initial reset pulse, the reset pins of the two monostables B1/B1 are released,\nand the clock cycles are started. Each monostable is timed for one millisecond for a\nclock frequency of 500 Hz. The clock then drives the timing registers B4, A4, C3 andB3 to generate the sequencer timing. For each step of the control memory, the timing"\nregisters clock through 200 milliseconds to create the various read pulses caused by\nthe stimuli injected into the system. The times and functions are detailed on the\nschematic and their use will be discussed with each applicable function.\nThe timing registers are interrupted and inhibited by the Subroutine Control Logic which\ncreates its own timing. During this time, the system configuration is fixed and the subroutine will iterate through the input commands for ISVC circuit verification. Following\neach iteration, control will return to! the Timing and Control board for continuation to\nthe next step.\nAt the. end of the test sequence, the control memory will enable gate D2, which selects\na pulse from the timing register, to reset latch D1/D1. At this time, the Test Sequencer\npower supply is shut down and the initiator circuit will reset the system to the starting\nnormal configuration.\n..\n\xe2\x80\xa2 - .

With continued activity in\nthe subroutine logic, a retrigger is regularly provided from the Subroutine Timing.\nRegister D3 pin 6. Once the iterations are complete, however, gate B4 flags the \'lastword-through\' which initially returns control to the control logic and, once the remain- ;\nder of the \'enable subroutine\' command has been cycled through, the timing register will\ncease retriggering C4 which will time out to complete the return-control cycle.\' A\n;\nsecond function of C4 is to yield a \'return-control\'signal to the control logic should the\ntiming logic fail within the Subroutine Logic. This prevents lock-up in a non-functioning :\nsubroutine. This could happen if an ISVC circuit set were to fail while under test such <\nthat the Subroutine Logic did not receive either clock or end-of-word information. Here,\nthe D3 register would cease clocking and, therefore, the required retrigger would be\nmissed.\n.\n.\n.\n\n;.\n\'\n\nThe timing sequence is illustrated in Figure 32 Subroutine Timing Diagram. As can be\nseen from this diagram, the shift register is made to load and shift on alternate 20 microsecond time slots as determined by the JK D4. And, during the shift cycle the address\ncounter is made to increment to the next word. Also, during the same word-frame time\nthat is used to load new data, a "read" pulse is generated such that the results of the\nlast word entered into the ISVC can be verified.\nThe discrete pulses for clocking the address counter, loading the register, retriggering\nthe one-shot, etc., are derived from the 8-bit Shift Register D3 which is clocked by the\nsystem clock after it has been divided-by-two at the Cl flip-flop. This spreads these\noperations out,over a period of 16 microseconds of the 20 microsecond word frame\nlength. .NOR gate A4 insures that the timing shift-clock is the same phase for each\nframe by resetting Cl at each end-of-word.\n\'.\n\ni\n\nThe counter B1/C1 generates the address for the ROM located at Al which is configured \xe2\x80\xa2.\n\'for a Signetics Device 8223.

The provision is _>\' ,\nthere, though to re-assign the word format and program a ROM for this location.\n.-; \'\nB2 is the parity generator which assigns odd parity to the word that is loaded into the\nshift register.\n.\nThe output of the shift register at A3 drives a set of four buffer-inverters used for\ninterface to complementary transistor sets. The transistors are used to "force" one\'s\nand zero\'s at the input of the ISVC input registers regardless of what information is\n.:\nthere at the time. Normally during this time, the input word to the ISVC circuits should\nbe. "all zero\'s" to provide clock and word sync. A zero enters the one\'s registers as a \xe2\x80\xa2". .\nlow and the zero\'s register as a high. The single exception is the odd parity bit for the\nincoming all-zero word which is a high for the one\'s register and a low for the zero\'s\n;\nregisters. In any case, the Subroutine Logic output will force in the proper state for\nthe word injected and the ISVC will be made to ignore incoming data. The incoming\nclock, however, is used to clock the test word into the registers.\n;\n3.3.27 Firing Logic; Valve and Spark Driver Test Encoder; Board No. 37 (Figure 33)\nThe purpose of this logic is to "read" and record the results of the test sequences\napplied to the Firing Logic and Spark and Drivers in steps 7 through 12 of the Test\nSequencer Control Memory. The status of the driver transistors is measured as well\nas the automatic turn-off feature of the Firing Logic.\nGates El, Dl and Cl are the "level 1" and "level 2" test gates which view the states of\n\'X\' and \'Y\' outputs of the Valve and Spark Drivers shown in Figure 23. Here, during\nthe test, one level at a time, is inhibited while a firing command is issued to verify the \xe2\x80\xa2\nstatus of the inhibit transistors.\nFor example, with level 1 inhibited (Figure 23) the top driver transistors should be\n"off" and open. The center transistors are on and the modulate transistor (bottom) is\n\n69\n\n\xc2\xa7\nu\ns\nw\n\nH\nW\n\nW\nH\n\ns\nCO\n\n.1\nW\n\no\n\ns\no\n6\nCO\nCO\n\n.w\no\n\nTO\n\nturned on when a firing command is programmed. During this state, the voltage ratio\nbetween the 4. 7K resistor (located across the top transistor) and the load is measured.\nAt this time, the current through the load is approximately 5. 3 ma for the Valve Driver\nand 5. 9 ma for the Spark Driver (both values being far below that current required to\noperate the load). The voltage across the load, then, for the Valve Driver is 100 mv.\nThe constant-current diodes located at emitters of the level 2 transistor, and the modu- \xe2\x80\xa2\nlate transistor would then both have low voltages at their inputs and their load resistors\nwould output logic \'zero\'s\' if_the level 1 transistor was open and not leaky or shorted.A similar situation exists during level 2 inhibit except that the level 2 constant-current\ndiode will output sufficient current (approximately 500 /^a) to let its load resistor output\na logic high (10V). The constant-cur rent diode at the modulate-transistor would again;\nbe current-inhibited such that the \'X\' output would be a low. This condition verifies \' ;\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n-*\nthat the level 1 transistor came on and that the level 2 transistor is off and open. Both :\ntests verity that the modulate-transistor is \'on1.\nNOTE: The current measurements that are made with the A/D converter monitoring : ;\nthe current of each branch of both the Valve and Spark Drivers yield a wealth\nof information about the drivers other than just the "on" load current. These\ndata are not recorded during the "self-test" but they could be. The various\ncurrents measured during the different level-inhibits and engine firings are :\nessentially .indicative of the transistors off-leakages as well as the states of .\nthe NPN controlling transistors and their sinking currents. A table of data\ncould be established as a troubleshooting guide to pin-point specific deteriora- ;\ntions different from nominal performance in the driver system.\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2\nWith the proper states outputted from the "X" and "Y" points of the drivers, the gates !\nEl, Dl and Cl will output a high during the read access time (Figure 33). The two level\ntests are distinguished by the decoder logic at the left of the schematic which views the\nlevel test in progress as well as which Firing Logic set is under test. The "read \'on\' ;\npulse" at pin 13 enables a set of six gates to set a group of latches to record the test\nresults.\n!\n\nIn addition, gates E3 and D3 are employed to verify the automatic turn-off feature of the\nFiring Logic under test. Here, a read pulse is issued after the firing pulse should be\nover.

The remaining inputs are the word errors from the logic on\nBoard No, 33 and the; read pulse from the Subroutine Logic Board No. 36. The word\nerrors are registered and recorded in the latch set in accordance with the ISVC pair\nthat the errors occurred in. Grates Bl, B2, B2 and B2 view the latch indications and\ndecode, and output which ISVC circuit(s) have failed.\nThe logic at the right of the schematic reads and records the status of the pressure\namplifiers into a two-bit code.\nEact set of "A" amplifiers for the chamber pressure and line pressure are stimulated\nwith an offset voltage as is "B" and "C" in sequence. The status of their corresponding\noutput comparators are logically sampled first in the unstimulated mode then in the\nstimulated mode to verify their performance. The information is recorded in the\nfollowing two-bit code:\n\n72\n\n73\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2-,-\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 0\n0\' 1\n10\n11\n\xe2\x80\xa2 , " ; \' . \'\n\n0-\n\nall amplifiers performing normally\nan "A" amplifier failed\na " B " amplifier failed\neither an "A" amplifier and a "B" amplifier failed\nor a "C" amplifier failed or one each of all three\nfailed\n\n3. 30 29\'- Function Monitor Performance and Redundancy Test Encoder;\nBoard No. 39, (Figure 35)\nThis logic verifies that the Function Monitors perform normally when operated with\nonly two of their three input supplies. Each powers a similar but separate section where\nthe outputs are majority-votedo In addition, this logic verifies that the automatic switchover feature performs as expected among the Firing Logic sets.\nThe logic to the left of the schematic verifies the Function Monitors performance during\nsteps 7, 8 and 9 of the Test Sequencer Control Memory. Here, each function monitor\nhas one of its sections power-disabled at the same time that the Firing Logics are\nexercised.. However, because the drivers are inhibited, the sensors will feed back\n"failure" information to the Function Monitors indicating that the set is inoperative.\nAlthough the Function Monitor Control has been inhibited from controlling the Firing\nLogic configuration, the outputs can be measured in response to the sensor indications.\nThese outputs are verified both prior to and during the "engine-on" activity by the "read\nnormal state" and "read sensing" pulses. The Function Monitor outputs are high prior\nto stimulation and low during stimulation to indicate system failure.

The control memory\ninitiates the system into the "A" set and the engine-on command is issued. The system\nshould the:n switch-\'over\'\' to the "B" set since there was no engine reaction. The engineon command is again issued and the system should switch once more to the "C" set. A\nthird cycle should witness shutdown of the "0" set.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\'<\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nAfter the "A" \'failure\' is withessed good or bad, the logic is forced into the "B" configuration for the next test. Again, after the "B" test good or bad, the logic is forced into\nthe "C" CQhfiguration for the second test. And, in turn, the "C" configuration is programmed for the last test. .

This circuit is comprised of an\nEMI filter with a re verse-polarity diode and a saturating-core inverter with associated\nrectifiers and filters. The shunt diode across LI in the EMI filter prevents a large\nvoltage spike from being developed when the inverter core saturates and the inverter\ncommutates. The operating frequency of the inverter varies from 13. 7 to 17. 8 KHz for\ninput,voltages of 24 volts to 32 volts.\n3. 3. 32.1.2 Isolated \xc2\xb110 Volt Supply\nA regulated supply of nominally + 10 V is generated by an absorptive type regulator\nutilizing a /M.723 precision voltage regulator and a series pass element. This type of\n\n78\n\n79\n\n___....\n\nf-,\no.\n\na\nPH\n\nCO\n\nI.\n00\nCO\n\nW\n\n80\n\ndesign is characterized by excellent transient response and good regulation against\nload and input voltage variations. Short circuit protection is simply provided by\n; ,\nsensing the voltage drop across a small resistor (20 7 ohm) which is proportional to the\nload current. When this voltage exceeds approximately 0. 6 volt corresponding to an\noverload condition, the base current of the pass element is decreased and the regulator ;\nlimits the output current to a safe value in excess of the normal maximum of 130 ma.\nSince the regulation on the -10 volt, 8 ma, supply is not critical, a simple one transistor\nregulator is adequate. A limiting resistor (180 ohms) protects the active components : .\nfrom a load short.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n"\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \'\xe2\x80\xa2 \'\n3.\'3. 32.1.3 \xc2\xb115 Volt Supply\n.:\nThe operation of the +15 volt, 170 ma, regulator is identical to that of the isolated\n;\n+ 10 volt regulator. The -15 volt regulator utilizes the +15 volt regulated voltage as a\nreference. This eliminates the need for a reference zener and provides automatic\nshutdown on the negative supply when the positive supply drops to zero. Short circuit :\nprotection is provided by sensing the voltage across a 2,7 ohm resistor. When the\nvoltage exceeds the base-to-emitter breakdown of a 2N2907A transistor, the transistor\nconducts, thus reducing the base drive of the pass element and limiting the output,\ncurrent to a safe level.\n;\n3. 3.32.1.4 +5 Volt Supply\nThis circuit provides a regulated output of 5 volts at a load current of up to 1. 5 amps.\nIn the circuit of Figure 38, Q5 functions as a comparator which compares the output\nvoltage to a reference voltage established by CR2 and the resistor divider network. The\noutput of Q5 controls the driver transistor Q2 which in turn drives the main pass\n;\nelement, Ql. Due to the large amount of power dissipated, the main pass element is\nmounted on a large heat sink fastened to the DIU chassis.\nOverload protection is accomplished by sensing the load current via the voltage drop\nacross R5. Because of the high current involved, a foldback current limiting scheme\n\n81\n\n\'\n\nis used; The foldback " characteristic is produced by R2, R3 and\xe2\x80\xa2 R4, which set the base\n: " \xe2\x80\xa2\n. .\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2\n,\\f\nbias of\'transistor (^3 just below the output voltage at zero load current.\nAs the voltage across the current sense resistor R5 increases with increase in load\ncurrent, the base voltage of Q3 increases to approximately 5. 6 volts at which point\nQ3 conducts and diverts the current supplied by CR1 from Q2. This action causes the ;\noutput voltage to start\'to crop. As:the load decreases further, Q3 conducts more\nheavily and.the potential across R4\'reverses. As the potential across R4 increases, the\nvoltage across R5 will decrease, thus causing the load current to foldback.\nOperation of the 5 volt regulator is controlled by the +10 volt, 230 ma supply and the\ncurrent limiting diode CR1. Removal of the regulated 10 volts will cause the 5 volt\nr\n\nregulator to immediately shut off.\n\n:\n\n3.3:32.1.5 +10:Volt; 230 ma/-10 Volt, 30 ma Supply\nThe/operation arid construction is similar to the \xc2\xb115 volt supply.\n,. i\n\n\'\n\n.\n\n:\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 - r\xe2\x80\x94\n\n~~;\xe2\x80\x94\n\n.,\n\n.\n\n...\n\n,\n\n3. 3i 32. 2 Power Supply D (Reference Figure 39)\nOutput Voltages & Loads\n\n:\nInput Voltage :\nAmbient Temperature\nDC Isolation. ;\n\n:\n\n+ 10 V, 130 ma\n-10 V, 8 ma\n:-10 V, 43 ma\n+ 10 V, 140 ma\n+ 10 V, 25 ma\n+ 5 V, 4.2 amp\n+ 5 V, 50 ma \',\n+ 15 V, 50 ma\n24 to 32 VDC\n-55\xc2\xb0Ctol25\xc2\xb0C\n. >10 ohms input to output\n\nTABLE;VL POWER SUPPLY D REQUIREMENTS\n\nDue to, the similarity between power supply D and power supply A, only the major\ndifferences will be discussed.\n\n82-\n\n83\n\n3.3.32.2.1\n\n+10 Volt, 25 ma Supply Shutoff\n\nThe operation of the +10 volt supply is controlled by a logic level supplied to pin 5 on\nthe emitter of the 2N2222A transistor. A low level ties the emitter lead to ground and\nallows the transistor to conduct. This in turn shuts off the regulator. A high level or\nan open will allow the regulator to function properly. The +10 V regulator in turn\ncontrols the 5V, 4. 2 amp supply.\n/ \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\',-"\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n3 . 3 . 3 2 . 2 . 2 + 5 Volt, 50i ma Supply\nSince the current requirement on this supply is low, a LM109 was chosen to provide the\nregulated 5 volts.

The\ncontrol panel sources information to be sent to the APS/DIU as a simulation of the Data\nTerminal/Data Bus function. The display panel utilizes the outputs of the APS/DIU to\ndisplay the spark ;and valve functions, the\'Status Monitor output words, the Emergency\nShutoff Monitor status plus various controls to normalize, fail or input external bridge\nresistances for .the system pressure strain gauges. The remaining displays are\nActuator Interface Unit functions which are not to be included in this report.\n3.4.1.1 Control Panel\nThe Control Panel incorporates toggle switches to manually program the Supervisory\nWord used to feed the APS/DIU when" the "MANUAL COMMAND/ENGINE ON-OFF"\nswitch is in the "MANUAL COMMAND" position.

When\nthe toggle is placed in the "CONT WORD",position, the Supervisory Word outputted is\nthat which is programmed (including the parity selected) and the word will exist within\neach 20 microsecond word frame produced. When the "SINGLE WORD" position is\ntoggled into this momentary position, a single word is issued at the supervisory output\nin accordance with .the program set. After the single word outputs, the Test Set will\nthen continue,.to output.the/all-zero\' word as before.\n.\nNow, when the MANUAL COMMAND/ENGINE ON-OFF switch is in the ENGINE ON-OFF\nposition, manual,control is inhibited,except that either CONT WORD or OFF is\nprogrammed., ; In CONT WORD, the output word is controlled by the ENGINE ON-OFF\ninput. Here,r<a square-wave generator is used for a singnal source where the frequency\nmay be^set for repetitious engine,.firings ie., 1 Hz. In.addition, when operating in this\nENGINE ON-OFF,mode, the "off" command may be inhibited by the switch provided.\nThe OPERATE/STANDBY switch inhibits all test set functions in the STANDBY mode\nsuch that it will output nothing.\n,\n,\n...\n3.4.1.2., Display, Panel . . ,\n...\nThe panel essentially "closes-the-loop" for the APS/DIU by displaying the outputs available. The EMERGENCY SHUTOFF lamp is illuminated when a Emergency Shutoff\nCommand has-been issued on the Control Panel or when the system senses and generates\nits.own ESO condition. ,,The pin.jacks provided permit metering the voltage available\nfrom the APS/DIU ESO driver. The SPARK lamp illuminates when the Spark Driver is\nactivated within the APS/DIU as does the VALVE lamp. Both the Spark and Valve inputs\nto the Test Set are appropriately loaded to simulate the system load; 25 ohms for the\nSpark Driver:and^560 ohms for the Valve Driver. ._ Again, pin jacks are provided to\nmeasure both the voltage of the,drivers as well as the timing. Two additional toggles\n\n86\n\nare provided to simulate "failure" modes of the Valve and Spark terminations. The\n\' Valve may be \'failed\' open or closed meaning that the fuel line is closed or opened\nrespectively. The Spark has the same failure provisions of the Display Panel except\nthe APS/DIU does not receive feedback from the Spark High Voltage Supply in the system\nand, therefore, the APS/DIU will not react to a Spark failure except if its internal\ndriver fails.\nThree additional sets of controls are available specifically for the GH2, GO2 and\nCHAMBER PRESSURE indications to the APS/DIU. Each has an associated toggle\nswitch such that the transducer may be "NORMAL", "FAILED" or simulated "EXT"\n(externally).\nThe"N<DRMAL" position provides a resistance (511 ohms) for the bridge -inputs of the\nAPS/DIU Strain Gauge Amplifiers. This value remains fixed during engine-fir ings for\nboth the GH2 and GO2 line pressures. The resistor is altered, however, for the\nCHAMBER PRESSURE during engine firings to simulate the generation of chamber\npressure. This is done with a relay which adds approximately 12 ohms to the 511 ohms\nin the bridge load.\nThe"FAIL" position of these switches alters the bridge such that the amplifiers will\ncross the failure-detected threshold of approximately 1 volt. In the CHAMBER PRESSURE\nset, the failure eliminates the capability to simulate \'chamber pressure\' during engine\nfiring by keeping the bridge resistance fixed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\'\'\n\nThe "EXT" position allows utilizing an external decade resistance box for substitution\ninto the bridge. Here, the amplifiers and A/D Converters monitoring these values may\nbe calibrated.\n3.4.2 Electrical Design\nThe modules discussed for the Test Set are assembled on boards similar to those used\nin the APS/DIU breadboard. All logic components are TTL 7400 devices or comparable\n\n87\n\nequivalents. The boards are .wirerwrapped and the power is supplied by external\nlaboratory bench supplies. \xe2\x80\xa2\nL\n\n*\n\n"(\n\n-\'\n\n3. 4. 2.1 Supervisory Word Generator (Figure 41)\nThis board generates the specific commands to be entered into the word stream feeding\nthe APS/DIU ISVC/circuits.\nThe switches shown,at,the left of the schematic are used to program the significant\n,..;\n!

This information is multiplexed-selected with the\nencoded ."engine-on" and "engine-off" commands developed automatically by the logic at\nthe lower-left which is feclby a squarewave generator. The ENGINE ON-OFF/MANUAL\nCOMMAND switch controls which data is selected.\n;\n\nThe data\' is leaded into a 20-bit serial register comprised of Fairchild 9300\'s and is\nshifted put through <a single Polar RZ modulator (75325) to drive the four lines to the\nAPS/DIUo During this shift cycle, the outputted data is detected by a comparator and\nre-cycled back through the shift register. At the end of each 20-bit 20 microsecond word\nframe, the information is parallel-shifted into a set of quad "D" storage elements which\ndrive display lamps. This mechanism provides assurance by the lamps that the word\nthat was programmed was outputted through the Polar RZ modulator. The data selected .\nto load into the registers is pre-empted by the \'cycle-control\' which disables.the multiplexer arid enters all zero\'s into the registers.\xe2\x80\xa2\n- \xe2\x80\xa2(\'\n\n3.4. 2. 2 Timing Logic (Figure 42)\nThis logic develops the timing and control for the Supervisory Word and the Data Word\n(employed in the Actuator Interface breadboards).\nThe logic is configured to generate 20-bit consecutive word frames plus the data frames\nwhich are in sync with the Supervisory Word.

The logic at\nthe top and at the bottom of the schematic is nearly identical to develop the controls of\n"Continuous Word", "Single Word" or "all-zero" words (off) for both the Supervisory\nand Data sections.\nFigure 43 describes the timing and signals generated.\n3.4.2.3 Display Panel Status Monitor (Figure 44)\nThe function of this circuit is to accept single words from the APS/DIU (or A,,I.) and\nstore and display the word information in 19 bits.\nThe data is received on four pair (schematic left) and line-selected by a rotary switch.\nThe line is then transformer coupled into a pair of comparators used as line receivers\nto recover the clock from the data. The data is outputted from comparator El and is\nfed to the shift register comprised of Fairchild 9300\'s. The two one-shots at Al are\nused to develop the register shift clock (125 nsec) and the "end-of-word" pulse (1. 25 jjsec).\nThe end-of-word pulse loads the storage elements which feeds the lamp drivers.\nA latch is shown (upper left), at location X2, which is used to recognize and drive a\nlamp indicating that a 19-bit word has been received and accepted. The purpose of this\nadded lamp is to inform the operator that an "all zero" word has been received as\nopposed to the Test Set receiving an "all-zero" word without any indications of activity.\nA reset switch is provided to clear this latch.\n3.4.2.4 Display Panel Control Logic (Figure 45)\nThis board serves two functions:\n(1) provide simulated hydraulic switching to close-the-loop\non the Actuator Interface Breadboard, and\n;\n(2) provide both a load and display for the APS/DIU as well\nas pressure sensor simulation.\n\n91\n\n:\n\nO\n\nu\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\nrt\nO\n\n92;.\n\n\xc2\xa7\nH\n<\nH\nOT\nJ\n\nH\n\nOT\nt\xe2\x80\x94i\n\np\n\n93\n\nO\n\xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\x94i\n\no\n\n2\n-O\n.U\nJ\n\nw\n\xc2\xa3\n\n2\nPn\n\nra-\n\n:^l\xe2\x80\x94\ni?\n\nin\nW\n. i \'V\n\n-HP-\n\n-\n\n.\n\nP\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2- \'\n\nI--.\n\n94\n\nThe Ac I\xc2\xbb Uo portion of this board will not be discussed in this report.\nThe right side of the schematic details the hardware used exclusively for the APS/DIU,\nThe Valve Drive is shown inputted on pins L and M of connector 3 and driving a relay B2.\nThe load presented by this relay is 40 to 50 ma so no additional load resistor is\nincluded. The contacts of this relay are used to feed through the "failure" switch SW11.\nThis switch is tied to the valve lamp as well as relay B4. A pair of contacts are brought\nout from B4 to simulate the "Valve Switch" requirements of the APS/DIIL In addition,\nanother pair of contacts are placed across a 12 ohm resistor such that the resistance\nincreases during valve activity.\nThe Spark input also drives a relay but, in addition, a 25 ohm resistor is across the\nrelay to raise the driver load current to 1 amp. The Emergency Shutoff Monitor is also\nfed to a relay. The relays for both the Spark and ESO drivers are used to illuminate\nlamps.\nA contributing asset derived from the use of relays (with diode protection) is the inherent\ndelay in turning them on and off. This delay somewhat simulates the delays that may\nbe experienced in driving the actual valves.\n3.4.2.5 Actuator Interface Breadboard Test Set Modules\nThe remainder of the Test Set functional modules are utilized exclusively for testing the\nActuator Interface Breadboard(s) and will not be discussed in this report,, They are\nincluded only for information purposes.\nFigure 46:\n\nClock Generator and A/D Converter\n\nFigure 47:\n\nA.

Because the design was oriented toward a "final\nproduct" in LSI format, the designs of several areas became more complex than that\nwhich would have resulted from a "minimum hardware" approach. Some design areas\nare merely \'go-as-is1 circuits; that is, the implementation into LSI is virtually an\nimmediate conversion from the operational schematics. Other areas require modification of minor changes in concept for more efficient implementation; this was proven by\n-j C\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 - - , , - , .\n\'\n.<. - ;\nthe breadboard effort, \'\n-\'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2i\n\nt\n\n. , * . - - -\n\n\\\n\n;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n>\n\nMaking this breadboard perform yielded several ideas. First, it proved that the dualfailure immunity concept is complex;\' Yet it; is hot so complex to make if impractical to\nimplement. Even to the extent that it was implemented in the APS/DIU where it\nmanages\'its own redundancy. \'" Second; the breadboard demonstrated two types of redundancy philosophies; four-wide and three-wide. Here, the four-wide circuits "perform\nidentically and in parallel as in the\'ISVC circuits. Failure immunity is achieved by a\ncomplex of inter-voters to compare-out the errors. The three-wide operates singly\n\xe2\x80\xa2f\n^ - i \xe2\x80\xa2 \\ -\xe2\x80\xa2 -\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 .\n,\n*\nand individually.\' A single function, as in the Firing Logic set, implements sufficient\ncircuitry to\'-determine its own validity. And,"\'when it fails, it powers up an identical\nbackup to perform thV same function.\nBoth techniques have\'their merit; both performed well. \'Both required added hardware;\nboth are difficult to test. Yet, together they complement the requirements of functional\nperformance, minimum density and minimum power requirements.\n4.2\n\nDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n\n"As proven out in the breadboard system, the circuit designs operate. However, some\ncircuits are basically inadequate or over-designed and; although this has been recognized,\nno additional time wlis consumed ttf re -arrange these designs.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2<\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nC\'-\'-\n\n\'\n\n*\n\n\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2-\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nV*1*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'\n\n98\n\n,\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIt is the function of a breadboard program to point out deficiencies and, unless the\n;\nproblem is major, they usually need not be corrected as long as the \'fix\' is operational\nand the problem is clearly identified.\n.\nThese areas will be discussed in this section.\n4.2.1 Line Receiver/Photo-Isolator Interface Circuit (Reference Figure 11)\nThe function of this circuit is to provide an isolated interface between the input lines and\nthe APS/DIU processing circuits. The purpose of designing a photo-isolator interface\nwas that, in microTinin technology, it could conceivably be packaged in less volume\nthan a transformer plus its related circuitry. This may still be true; however, the\ncircuit that resulted during the breadboard program became necessarily complex such\nthat it would perform over temperature, and, its power requirements are high. The\nMCD-4 photo-isolator diode works over temperature provided that it is driven hard\n(160 ma each) and the recovery circuits required to re-establish the data are complex ,.\nand consume considerable power. Consequently, the circuit is considered too complex\nfor the function that it performs; and, since it is a "power-hog" it is doubtful that it\ncould be efficiently micro-miniaturized considering the heat that has to be removed.\nConclusively, the photo-isolator technique should be shelved until more efficient devices\nare available and the circuit should be replaced with a pulse transformer coupler, as\nshown in Figure 48. The volume of the transformer can be small and its associated\ncircuitry can be hybridized. The end volume consumed would probably be less than\nthat required to produce the photo-isolated unit plus the power supply required to\nsupport it.\n.\n,\n4.2.2 Power Enable/Disable Logic (Reference Figures 16, 17 and 18)\nThe logic in these functions is triplex/majority-voted to an output set of quad transistors\nand parallel transistors used as switches to \'turn-on\' or \'ground\' the power to the Firing\nLogic. This circuit can be considerably simplified using a set of buffer/drivers to\ncontrol the power switching instead of transistors. The power requirements of the\nFiring Logic is considerably less than is presently deliverable.\n\n99\n\n4A/ES.\n\nFIGURE 48. POLAR RZ LINE RECEIVER INTERFACE.\n\nThe original design was intended to open both the power and ground paths to the Firing\nLogic. However, because of the input protective circuits employed in CMOS gates, the\nresults of opening the power lines was to output the input signals from the Firing Logic.\nThe logic became a resistive pass-element and mixed the input signals to any singleoutput. Consequently, the only way to completely disable this logic was to resistively\nisolate each input and ground "the\'power line.\nThe Power Enable/Disable Logic was then modified to generate either a +10 volt or a\nground to the Firing Logic power^ line,,; Much of the circuitry incorporated became\nunnecessary, but was left in.\ny\nFigure 49 illustrates this output circuit for the Power Enable/Disable.\n\n100\n\nKflAY\n\ntoeic\n\nFIGURE 49.\n\nSUBSTITUTE POWER ENABLE/DISABLE DRIVER\n\n101\n\n4.2.3\n\nTest Sequencer;.-(Reference Figures 28 through 35)\n\n.\n\n.\n\n4.2. 3,1 TTL versus CMOS\'Implementation\n.\n-.\xc2\xab\nThe circuits designed and fabricated for the Test Sequencer were done, in part in TTL\nas opposed to CMOS. During the design effort, several areas had to remain flexible so\nthat during system test the functions of the Test Sequencer could\'easily be updated if "\nnecessary. Consequently, TTL was employed in the timing and control sections because\nof its convenience and availability.\n.\nIn the final configuration, the Test Sequencer would be implemented in CMOS/LSI\nbecause its design has been virtually finalized. Again, the breadboard proved out the ,\nfeasibility of the technique, and the direction has been defined-for the final package.\n4. 2; 3. 2 \'Philosophy of .Data.Formulation\nPresently,^ the Test Sequencer is configured to output an "all-zero" word if all functions\nperform correctly or a pattern of one\'s, some of which are 2-bit codes identifying\nprobable if not specific, failed area. Two significant changes are recommended in\nthis area: " \' . . \xc2\xab \'\n. . ; \' ,-\xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\xa2 , . , . : \xe2\x80\xa2\n\'. \'\n- \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n,\n* -\xe2\x80\xa2\n,\n"\' "l \' "\n\xe2\x80\xa2 I .. \'\n\n--\xe2\x80\xa2 >(1) At the initiation.of the \'self-test\' a reset pulse is issued to ;..,,.- ... n fix the re cor ding, latches to a \'zero\' state and then as failed\ninformation is collected," it is used to set the latches to the v\n^ j ? \xe2\x80\xa2 .- \'one\'state. After this scheme had been-implemented, .it .\n,.\n.\nbecame obvious that this initiation method and collection\n.\n"\'"\'"\nmethod is inverse of the ideal process. That is, the reset\n. " \xe2\x80\xa2"-\xe2\x80\xa2:.\' pulse should fix the latches to an all \'one\' state (the failed .\nstate) and as good information is collected, the latches are\nset to the \'zero\' state. Here, it takes correct logical activity\n, , ,, to recognize "good" performance rather than inactivity imply, ,,.,ing "good" operation and activity recognizing "failed" data.\nAn examination of the system shows several areas where a\nTest Sequencer gate could fail and the resultant outputted information would indicate that the tested operation was valid. The\nTest Sequencer operation would not be suspect until the system\n.;\xe2\x80\xa2 -\xe2\x80\xa2 - - itself did not perform as well as the Test Sequencer indicated it should.\n\n102\n\n(2)\n\nAnother area which should be considered for design\nalteration is the bit scheme used to indicate the test\nresults. Presently, the outputted 16-bit word is a\ndirect readout of several tests; some single bits\nassigned for "go-no" of a specific section or a twobit code indicating such things as "A is bad; B is\nbad, or both A and B are bad, or C is bad. " These\ntwo-bit schemes depend somewhat on the probability\nof catastrophy and are really insufficient as a measure\nof the system performance,, It is recommended,\ntherefore, that an encoding scheme be devised to take\nadvantage of the 2*6 possible combinations that could\nexist for the \'self-test\' report.\n\n4. 2. 3, 3 Test Sequencer Tests 13 through 15\nThe intent of these three tests was to validate the automatic switch-over capability from\nFiring Logic "A" to "B" to "C" and then off. The sequence would depend on the Function\nMonitors to recognize that the engine was not responding to the Firing Logic commands\n(they were inhibited) and would therefore shut down their associated set and cause turn- .\non of the backup.\nOnce the system had been assembled and operating, it was recognized that this function\ndid not work as a process of the Test Sequencer. The control memory function of the\nTest Sequencer has "hard control" of the various APS/DIU functions including the\nPower Enable/Disable Logics as it sequences through the various tests. That is, it\nwill force a circuit on or force it off and it will hold that given state until the reverse is\nrequired. This hard-control has to be released during tests 13 through 15 but maintained\nfor the earlier tests. For instance, at the beginning of test 13, Logic Set "A" has to be\nturned on such that the Function Monitor can turn it off when it recognizes the \'failure.\'\nThe Control Memory, however, holds it \'on\' continually and therefore the Function\nMonitor \'turnoff activity is not recognized nor is the backup logic "B" turned \'on\'\nsince it too is held off by the memory.\nBecause this problem emerged at the time that the unit was due to be delivered to NASA,\na redesign was not undertaken to fix this test although the method for doing so is\n\n103\n\nrecognized and the modifications will be added if NASA requires it in the breadboard.\nFirst, two "test^enable",and test disable!1 inputs have to be configured to each of the .\nPower Enable/Disable boards "A", "B" and. "C". One of these sets would be used for\nthe \'hard-control\';requirements and the other would be considered \'soft-control\' where\nthe required configuration is capacitively pulsed at the beginning of the test and control\nreleased throughout the test. Here, for instance, Power Enable/Disable "A" would be\npulsed "on" at the beginning of test 13 prior to the issuance of the "engine-on" command.\nPower.Enable/Disable sets "B^ and "C" would be pulsed "off" at this same time. Then\nthe logics would be free to act among themselves and the results measured. .-At the\nbeginning of test 14 "B." would be pulsed \'on and "A" and "G"-would be pulsed "off:\nprior to the !\'engine-on" command. Again, the logics would be free to act among\nthemselves and the results measured. A similar process would be exercised for\ntest 15.\n4..2.S/4 :Power Supplies and Power Consumption\nThe system breadboard consumes approximately sixty watts in its present configuration\nwhich is considerably higher than.necessary. The power supplies are designed to supply\nthis energy for the breadboard. In the final configuration, with all circuits LSI and/or\nhybridized and with the TTL elements minimized, it is estimated that the power require\'*ments:wili-be less than 10 watts maximum. This means a considerable reduction in the\nvolume requirements for the power supplies (although the same design philosophy will .\nbe followed) and less-heat to remove.\n.\xe2\x80\xa2 Theicircuits adjusted for -reduced power would be the Line Receiver (transformer ,\ncoupling instead of photo-isolation), the Power Enable/Disable Logic, the Test\nSequencer (CMOS instead of TTL)j and the Power Interrupt circuits which are designed\nto switch heavier loads than will be required.\n\n104\n\n4.3 LSI IMPLEMENTATION\nThe next step in the APS/DIU development would be the manufacture of LSI prototype\nmodels using CMOS/LSI and hybrid techniques for the non-digital circuitry. Because\nthe chip manufacturing technique yields multiple chips for each single run, the prototype\nfabrication would, in fact, yield approximately 20 models for the cost of one.\n4.3.1 Implementation Procedures\nThe system would first be partitioned into areas that operate from a common supply\nwith a minimum I/O count plus maximum device count. Specifications would be rigidly\ndefined for the function(s) such that the logic diagram may be computer verified for\nfunctional validity. At this time, revisions may be programmed to improve response,\npropagation delay, etc., and this also will be computer-verified as well as generate\nupdates i n t h e logic diagrams.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 - . . - \' . .\nOnce the functional diagrams have been idealized, the design is ready for layout. Here,\nthe "cells" are compiled from the library of devices presently available to generate the\nfunctions required. Computer layout may be used exclusively or it may be complemented\nwith additional hand layout to maximize the density if the particular chip design is ,\ncrowded.\nOnce the layout is complete, the photo artwork is generated to create the masks required.\nThen the wafers are exposed and the processes of diffusion, oxidation and metalization\nare performed as required. Several tests are performed on the wafers as they are\nproduced to verify their operational characteristics and then they are packaged in multipin flat packs or just dices for chip-and-wire bonding to other devices on a-substrate. f;\nThe processes briefly outlined here are shown in Figure 50, in block diagram form. . \xe2\x80\xa2\n4.3.2 jliSI Implementation Program Requirements\nA typical turn-around time for chip production is approximately 60 days, given 30 days\nfor design and thirty days for prototype production. However, several tasks must be\n\n105\n\nJTEST\n\nMANUAL AIDE\n\nFIGURE 50.\n\nLSI PROTOTYPE PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAM\n\n.accomplished prior to the design of any chips. A brief list of these tasks are as\nfollows:\n(1) Firm systems definition on I/O; word format, codes, etc.\n(2) Firm definition on valve and spark requirements.\n(3) Firm definition on sensor format; valve switches, pressure\nsensors, etc.\n(4) Revision and update on certain circuit designs and procedures\noutlined in this report.\n.- (5) Firm definition of package goal; (64 in^)0\n(6) Partitionm^ofjrthe APS/DIU circuitry to minimum number of\nchips with\' maximum density and compatible I/O.\n(7) Partitioning and layout of hybrid micro-miniaturized circuitry.\nAfter these items have been covered, chip design may begin. Qnce,the chips are available arid the hybrid hardware has been layed out, the first prototypes may be assembled,,\nAs a budgetary time estimate, ECI feels that a one-year program is a reasonable goal\nto produce several prototypes following firm systems definition.\n\n106\n\n'
