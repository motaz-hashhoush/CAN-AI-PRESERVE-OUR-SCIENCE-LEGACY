The new EOC has been upgraded and enhanced to support a wide spectrum of emergencies affecting JSC and neighboring communities. One of the main features of the EOC is its premier computerized dispatch center. The new system unites many of JSC's critical emergency functions into one integrated network. It automatically monitors fire alarms, security entrances, and external cameras. It contains the JSC inventory of hazardous materials, by building and room, and can call up Material Safety Data Sheets for most of the generic hazardous materials used on-site. The EOC is available for community use during area emergencies such as hurricanes and is a welcome addition to the Clear Lake/Galveston Bay Area communities' emergency response resources.", "title": "Emergency Operations Center at Johnson Space Center", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-18T22:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19980235656, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Caylor, Gary C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "8c73543731b141e582e7c2bfc856900e"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19980235656, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980235656, "id": "3204e63a27ea4809bf3cc4cc5ab1b88e", "publicationName": "Proceeding from the 1997 NASA Occupational Health Conference: Achieving Quality in Occupational Health", "publicationDate": "1997-12-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19980235636, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Achieving Quality in Occupational Health", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
