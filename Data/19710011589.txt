The disadvantage of many of these prior art devices is that, in instances where they do have a desired elasticity, they are\ninherently limited by the fact that they tend to fail when\nthey are subjected to extreme temperature conditions,\nsuch as approximately 200\xe2\x80\x9d F. Conversely, where the\nprior art devices may have a desired temperature quality,\nthen they are not sufficiently elastic for stretching at such\ntime as the last stage rocket booster expands in its circumferential dimension as a result of and due to internal\npressure and temperature conditions that exist during the\noperation of the rocket booster.\nA further disadvantage with many prior art tie-down\ndevices is the absence of \xe2\x80\x9cfail-safe\xe2\x80\x9d features in that a\nportion thereof attains a temperature in the range of 400500\xe2\x80\x9d F. due to any number of possibilities, such as the\nrocket booster case burning through in one spot or local\nexcessively hot spots. Also encountered in the prior art\ndevices is the difficulty of joining different types of cords\ntogether such as fiberglass types to nylon types. It has\nbeen observed that when two different types of cord materials are joined together, they are generally unreliable\nas a tie-down mechanism inasmuch as they are subjected\nto failure at the joint thereof in being exposed to high\ntemperatures.\nThe present invention relates to a tie-down cable comprising a nylon cord housed within a woven, braided Teflon-treated fiberglass covering which is selected to be\nlonger than the nylon cord. This cable is formed approximately into a circle or loop under tension about the last\nstage of the rocket booster with the ends thereof being\njoined together under compression by a copper retaining\nsleeve (Nicopress sleeve), so that the cable holds the\nappendages securely in place. Since the braided fiberglass\n\nPatented Qct. 31, 1967\n\n20\n\n26\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\nsleeving is longer than the nylon cord, only the nylon\ncord is pre-loaded when the cable encircles the rocket\nbooster and has its ends securely joined by the copper retaining sleeve. With the cable constructed in this manner,\nthe rocket booster can expand several inches before the\nfiberglass covering carries any load at all. Explosive activated guillotine means cooperate with the cable to sever\nit at a predetermined time to thereby permit the appendages to be extended upon the release of the cable.\nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an appendage tie-down mechanism that precludes\npremature erection of appendages.\nIt is another object of the present invention to provide\na tie-down mechanism useful in retaining satellite appendages, and that can withstand high temperatures and yet\nbe capable of possessing a high degree of elasticity.\nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide a satellite appendage tie-down mechanism that precludes premature erection of appendages and that possesses \xe2\x80\x9cfail-safe\xe2\x80\x9d features should abnormally high temperature or pressure conditions exist.\nThe above and other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon full consideration of\nthe following detailed description and accompanying drawings in which:\nFIGURE 1 is an isometric view of a rocket booster\nand satellite combination with the satellite appendages retained to the booster by the tie-down mechanism of the\npresent invention;\nFIGURE 2 is a plan view of a preferred embodiment\nof the tie-down mechanism formed into a circle about\nthe last stage of the rocket booster of FIGURE 1;\nFIGURE 3 is an enlarged view of the cut-away portion\ntaken along line 33 of the tie-down mechanism of FIGURE2;and\nFIGURE 4 is an enlarged, partial cross-sectional view\nof the joint of the tie-down mechanism of FIGURE 2\ntaken along line 4 4 thereof.\nReferring now to the drawings, there is shown in FIGURE 1 a space vehicle 2 including a satellite 3 having\nbooms 4 and solar paddles 5 affuted thereto, and a rocket\nbooster 6 formed as an integral part therewith. Tie-down\nmechanisms 10 and 10\xe2\x80\x99of the type shown in FIGURE 2\nand described in more detail hereinafter, are used to hold\nbooms 4 and solar paddles 5, respectively, against and\nalongside rocket booster 6 during the launch and powered\nflight of space vehicle 2.\nTie-down mechanism 10, as shown in FIGURE 2, comprises a cable 11 formed into a circle about the appendages to be tied down, such as the booms and/or solar\npaddles (not shown), and in which there is a joint 12 including a retaining sleeve 13 to connect the ends of cable\n11.Two cutting devices 15 are positioned relative to cable\n11 to sever the cable at a predetermined time.\nCable 11, as illustrated in FIGURE 3, is essentially a\nnylon cord 14 housed within a loose fitting, woven,\nbraided, Teflon-treated, fiberglass covering 18. As used in\nFIGURE 1, and more clearly depicted in the cut-away\nportion showing of FIGURE 3, under normal operating\nconditions nylon cord 14 is held under tension by the\ncompression action of retaining sleeve 13 at joint 12. On\nthe other hand, the fiberglass covering 18, which is selected to be longer than the nylon cord 14 housed therewithin, is loosely fitted and under no tension.\nNylon cord 14, under ideal operating conditions of the\nspace vehicle, serves to hold the appendages in place.\nHowever, as already explained above, under abnormal\nconditions, such as excessive temperature variations or\nbooster case failures (burn through), the nylo? cord\ncould very well give a d & break, thereby releasing the\nappendages prematurely. m e n such a condition exists,\nthe fiberglass covering, which has not been previously\n\n3,350,034\n3\n\n4\n\nunder tension and which can withstand up to approximately 1000\xe2\x80\x9d F., takes over to hold the appendages in\nplace. By the cable 11 being constructed in this manner,\na \xe2\x80\x9cfail-safe\xe2\x80\x9d feature is provided in the form of fiberglass\ncovering 18. In addition, by fiberglass covering 18 being\nloosely fitted about nylon cord 14, the nylon cord is able\nto elongate or stretch as the casing of the booster expands\ndue to heating and/or pressure during normal operating\nconditions. In other words, fiberglass covering 18 does\nnot restrain the circumferential movement of nylon cord\n14.\nFiberglass covering 18 also provides protection for\nnylon cord 14 by acting as a thermal insulator therefor.\nIt is worthwhile to note that it is both braided and woven\nto provide extra strength and is treated with Teflon to\nreduce the friction between it and the appendages. Accordingly, it can be stated that during normal operation of\ntie-down mechanism 10, nylon cord 14 serves to hold the\nappendages against booster 6 and fiberglass covering 18\nacts as a thermal insulation therefor and, at such time\nwhen abnormal conditions exist and nylon cord 14 fails,\nfiberglass covering 18 takes the place of the nylon cord\nand thereby prevents premature erection of the appendages.\nFIGURE 4 illustrates an embodiment of the copper\nretaining sleeve 13 used in maintaining nylon cord 14\nunder tension and having two apertures 17, 19 therein,\none for each end of cable 11 to pass through and be retained upon retaining sleeve 13 being swaged or crimped.\nIn the use of this particular retaining sleeve, for example\na Nicopress, it has been found that the most reliable grip\nis achieved when both ends of cable 11 are prepared as\nfollows:\nThe fiberglass covering 18 is bunched up to expose the\nextremities of nylon cord 14. Then, an inner silicon rubber collar 16 is inserted between nylon cord 14 and fiberglass covering 18, and an outer silicon rubber collar 22\nis placed over fiberglass covering 18. These two collars\nare chosen to have a length slightly longer than the length\nof the apertures within retaining sleeve 13 and diameters\nsuch that they can easily be formed with cable 11 and\nstill, at the same time, form a snug fit therewith. In addition, the total diameter of cable 11, with the collars, must\nbe such that cable 11, with the collars, can be inserted\ninto apertures 17, 19 of retaining sleeve 13.\nCollars 16 and 22 are used to enhance the friction fit\nof the various elements of cable 11 with the apertures of\nretaining sleeve 13 and also to assist in preventing the\nedges of retaining sleeve 13 from rupturing or cutting\nfiberglass sleeve 18.\nOnce both ends of cable 11 are prepared in the manner\njust described, they are inserted in apertures 17 19 as\n1,\nshown, and the extremities of nylon cord 14 are pulled\nso that nylon cord 14 is put under tension. Then retaining\nsleeve 13 is crimped so that those portions of cable 11\nwithin apertures 17, 19 are gripped tightly and prevented\nfrom moving. Finally, the exposed extremities of nylon\ncord 14 are tied together into a square knot which, in\nconjunction with retaining sleeve 13, forms joint 12.\nIn summary, it can be stated that tie-down mechanism\n10, because of nylon cord 14 being elastic, compensates\nfor the expansion of rocket booster 6 about which it is\ndisposed, due to variations in temperature and pressure\nwhen the space vehicle is in launch and flight phase. On\nthe other hand, should nylon cord 14 fail for any reason\nwhatsoever, then the appendages will open very slightly\nand fiberglass covering 18 will take over to restrain\nthese appendages from erecting. Accordingly, fiberglass\ncovering 18 provides the \xe2\x80\x9cfail-safe\xe2\x80\x9d feature for the tiedown mechanism 10.\nAt a predetermined time and just prior to the separation of satellite 3 from booster stage 6, cutting devices 15\nsever cable 11, thereby permitting -yelease of solar cell\npaddles 5 and booms 4 so dhat\xe2\x80\x99they can assume their\ndesired position relative to the satellite. It should be un-\n\nderstood that while two cutting devices 15 are shown in\nFIGURE 2, the same result can be achieved with one.\nThe second cutting device is included as an added insurance feature.\nWhile the tie-down mechanism 10 has been described\nas generally having an inner nylon cord 14 and an outer\nfiberglass covering 18, it should be noted that the cord\ncan be of any one of a number of materials which are\nelastic and can withstand such temperature and pressure\nconditions as are associated with rocket boosters in\nflight, and the covering can likewise be of a material that\nhas strength and can withstand rather abnormally high\ntemperature and pressure conditions as are concerned\nwith rocket boosters in flight.\nIt should be understood that various changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which\nhave been described and illustrated to explain the nature\nof the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art\nwithin the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.A tie-down system for restraining various appendages\nof a space vehicle against the surface of a rocket booster\nattached thereto, comprising: an elastic cord of sufficient\nlength to fit around the circumference of said booster,\na woven, braided, Teflon-treated fiberglass covering\nadapted to overlie said elastic cord and being slightly\nlonger in length than said elastic cord when said cord is\nin its unloaded condition, and a retaining means for\njoining the ends of said elastic cord and the ends of\nsaid fiberglass covering into a composite joint such that\nsaid outer fiberglass covering is under conditions of no\nload, while said elastic cord is pre-loaded.\n2.
