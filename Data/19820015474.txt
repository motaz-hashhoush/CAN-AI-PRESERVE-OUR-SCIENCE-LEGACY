For a door drive system failure\nsuch\nthat the door can neither\nbe opened or closed,\nthe EVA crewmember uses the\ntubing cutter\nto cut the upper or lower drive tubes.\nOnce the door drive\ntubes have been cut, the EVA winch rope hook is routed over the number 4\nbulkhead hook roller\nand attached\nto the number 4 latch bellcrank\nat the\ntip of the door.\nThe rope is then reeled back in by the winch until\nthe\ndoor has been fully\nclosed.\nIf a gang of bulkhead latches\non either\nend of\none or both doors fails\nto operate properly,\nthe EVA crewmember uses the\n3-point\nlatch tool to fully\nclose and secure the door.\nCENTERLINE LATCH TOOL\nIf\nfails\nto\nmeans.\nlatching\n(enough\n\na gang of centerline\nlatches\non the right-hand\npayload bay door\noperate properly,\nthe doors must be safely\nsecured by some other\nThe centerline\nlatch tool is an EVA manual backup device for\nthe Orbiter\'s\npayload bay doors for reentry.\nFour of these tools\nto bypass one gang of latches)\nare carried\nonboard the Orbiter.\n\nDesign criteria\nrequired\nthat the tool fit\nall 16 centerline\nlatches.\nIt had to be able to interface\nwith the existing\ncenterline\nlatch mechanisms\nand payload bay doors.\nThe problem of misalignment\ndue to thermal\ndistortion was also considered.\nThe tool had to close the doors having 5.05 cm\n(1.99 inches) misalignment\nin the y-axis\nand 10.97 cm (4.32 inches) misalignment in the z-axis.\nMisalignment\nin the x-axis was considered\nnegligible\nbecause the four passive shear fittings\nalign the doors in the x-direction.\nThe tool provides\na load path for y and z forces on the payload bay doors\nto maintain\nthe Orbiter\'s\nstructural\nintegrity\nduring reentry.\nThe centerline\nlatch tool\'s\nand procedures had to be within\n\ncontrols,\nhandgrips,\noperating\nthe capabilities\nof a partially\n\n64\n\nforces,\nrestrained,\n\nEVA crewmember in a zero-gravity\nenvironment.\nThese design requirements\nare set by the Shuttle\nEVA Description\nand Design Criteria\nDocument\nAnother requirement\nis that the tool be provided\na safety\n(~~~-10615).\ntether\nattach point since it will\nbe transported\nor handled during EVA.\nThe tool also had to retain\nitself\nin position\nwhile being used by the\ncrewmember.\nThe centeriine\nlatch tool (Fig. 4) consists\nof a frame, a screw/nut\ndrive assembly turned by a ratchet\nthat pivots\nin the frame, and the latch.\nThe ratchet\nhandle folds down into a stowed position\nto conserve space.\nThe release button,\nwhich is used to deploy the tool latch,\ncan be depressed\nfrom either\nside of the tool frame.\nIt has a safety catch, also on both\nsides,\nsuch that it cannot\nbe inadvertently\ndepressed.\nThe installation\nsequence is shown on Fig. 5.\nINSTALLATION\nThe tool is installed\nby first\ninserting\nit on the failed\ncenterline\nhook latch.\nThen the tool is rotated\nto brace it in place (Fig. 6).\nThe\nsafety catch is removed on the release button to be depressed.\nWhen the\nrelease button is depressed,\nthe tool latch is deployed.\nThe tool latch\nbypasses the existing\nhook latch regardless\nof the position\nof the centerline hook latch.\nThe ratchet-handle\nis now unfolded.\nIn this configuration,\nthe crewmember holds the tool and extends the screw by ratcheting\nuntil\na\nforce is applied on the centerline\nlatch passive roller,\nclosing\nand\nsecuring the door.\nThe sleeve on the ratchet\nhandle is raised and the\nhandle folded to the stowed position.\nOne tool is installed\non each centerline\nlatch in the disabled\ngang\nin the same sequence as normal door closure.\nAfter installing\nthe last\ntool,\nthe crewmember is ready to reenter\nto the crew module.\nTESTING\nThe centerline\nlatch tool has undergone development and evaluation\nby\ncrewmembers and NASA personnel.\nExtensive\ntesting\nand training\nhave also\nbeen done using the full-scale\nmockup of the Orbiter\nin the Weightless\nEnvironment\nTraining\nFacility\n(WETF) at the Johnson Space Center.\nThis\ntesting\ndetermined\nthat the centerline\nlatch tool was within\nextravehicular\ncapabilities\nand workload limits.\nA qualification\ntest fixture\nwas also\non the latches.\nThe centerline\nlatch tool\nlatches.\nThen, using a hydraulic\ncylinder,\nit would see during reentry.\n\n65\n\nI\n\nbuilt\nto simulate\nthe loading\nwas installed\non the test fixture\nthe tool reacted the loads that\n\nCONCLUDINGREMARKS\nThe flight\ntools are stored onboard the Cargo Bay Stowage Assembly,\nflights.\na stowage container\nlocated\nin the payload bay, during the Shuttle\nThe centerline\nlatch system is a reliable\nmechanical\nsystem;

cross-sectional\nview of a TBI configured\nfor an ETA tip input.\nA high-explosive\ndonor charge is press loaded into the\ncavity\nagainst the bulkhead on the input side, and a receptor\ncharge is
