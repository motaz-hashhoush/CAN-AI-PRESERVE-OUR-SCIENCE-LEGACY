Since there was no corresponding Red Team for the Code O Blue Team, the Blue Team assumed a Red Team independent attitude and challenged the status quo, including current work processes, functional distinctions, interfaces, and information flow, as well as traditional management and system development practices. The Blue Team's unconstrained, non-parochial, and imaginative look at NASA's space communications program produced a simplified representation of the space communications infrastructure that transcends organizational and functional boundaries, in addition to existing systems and facilities. Further, the Blue Team adapted the 'faster, better, cheaper' charter to be relevant to the multi-mission, continuous nature of the space communications program and to serve as a gauge for improving customer services concurrent with achieving more efficient operations and infrastructure life cycle economies. This simplified representation, together with the adapted metrics, offers a future view and process model for reengineering NASA's space communications to remain viable in a constrained fiscal environment. Code O remains firm in its commitment to improve productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency. In October 1992, the Associate Administrator reconstituted the Blue Team as the Code O Success Team (COST) to serve as a catalyst for change. In this paper, the COST presents the chronicle and significance of the simplified representation and adapted metrics, and their application during the FY 1993-1994 activities.", "title": "Re-engineering NASA's space communications to remain viable in a constrained fiscal environment", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950011170, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hornstein, Rhoda Shaller"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "5a424c905c16473b83486872fc771e40"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950011170, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hei, Donald J., Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD., United States"}}, "id": "e025a01f5bd445b7ba8a4c16a5082d7b"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19950011170, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kelly, Angelita C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD., United States"}}, "id": "b2337318b861455f9e118f95a2eb5889"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19950011170, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lightfoot, Patricia C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD., United States"}}, "id": "50022960c3424e358a29b5bf0a132ad2"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19950011170, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bell, Holland T."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Wallops Flight Facility", "location": "Wallops Island, VA., United States"}}, "id": "58538e80ffd341e580959b9a84479295"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 19950011170, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cureton-Snead, Izeller E."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab.", "location": "California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena, CA., United States"}}, "id": "9de6e2bc6a78423a87bbf609f7f1f5ce"}, {"sequence": 6, "submissionId": 19950011170, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hurd, William J."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab.", "location": "California Inst. of Tech., Pasadena, CA., United States"}}, "id": "7d89d5be40a9402b8d6cce9f16628ff1"}, {"sequence": 7, "submissionId": 19950011170, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Scales, Charles H."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL., United States"}}, "id": "1db06801f5eb4e03a48f6c2c4c015349"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950011170, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950011170, "id": "b2afe143674c47d8bf33f64e507ab07c", "publicationName": "NASA.
