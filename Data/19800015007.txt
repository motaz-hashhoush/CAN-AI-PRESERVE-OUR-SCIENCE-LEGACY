A review of that report will\nhelp to understand the need and use of the EVA tool set.\n\n"\n=\n\ni\n\n!_:\n\nto a designated position by two actuator systems, one on either side of the\nThe payload bay doors are closed by a drive system that moves consists\npaylnad bay.

The gear box output is transmitted through drive linkage to the\ndoor as shown in figure 2.\nThe forward edges of the doors are connected to the bulkhead by l_tch\nmechanisms mounted on the doors and mating hook rollers mounted on the bulkhead (fig. 3). The latch mechanisms consist of a right-hand and a left-hand\ngang of four latches, one on each door, that operate sequentially. Each gang\nof latches is driven by an electromechanica[ rotary actuator.

Various cutting angles and wheel thicknesses were tried untila combination that could withstand the side loads and the cutting loads was\nfound.\nThe tubing cutter (fig. 5) consists of the housing, the body that congains two fixed rollers, a spring-loaded roller, and the cutting wheel/screw\nratchet assembly.\nThe body is turned in one direction within the housing by\nthree pawls mounted in the housing.\nBy alining openings in the housing and\nthe body, the goal can be installed anywhere along the tube.\nThe tool is\nretained in position by a spring-loaded roller until the cutting wheel can be\nforced against the tube by the screw ratchet.\nOnce a load is applied on the\ncutting wheel, the handle on the housing is ratcheted back and forth, causing\nthe body to turn around the tube. After the body has made one complete revolution around the tube, the cutting wheel is again advanced against the tube\nwith the screw ratchet.\nThis procedure is continued until the tube has been\nCUt.\n\n20\n\ni \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_\n_\ni .,\ni\n!_\'\ni_,\n\nAfter _he tube is cut,\n_ha _ool is removed from eha tuba and rese,_ for\neha next cue by alining\neh_. openings\nin th_ housing and body, re,versing\nthe.\ncontrol\nle,ver,\nand re,erecting\neha cute i ng wheel with the. screw ratchet\nuntil\nthe ne,xt tuba to he cue will move into position\nin the tool.\nThe control\nlaver\nis returned\ngo the original\nposition\narid the` cutting\nwhee,1 is forced\nagainst\nthe second tuba by the arrow ratchet.\nThis procedure\nis repea_e,d\nuntil\nall six drive\ntubas on the a_fected\ndoor have be_n cut.\nThe` door is\nthen ready to be,manually closed by using the winch to pull the disabled door\nto a position where the bulkhead leeching system can be actuated.\n\ni "\nI\n\n,\n\ni :\n\nW INCH\n\ni_i._\n.......\n\nTwo EVA w_nches, one mounted to each bulkhead, are provided to manually\nclose the doors to a position where the bulkhead latching system can be aclusted or the thr_-@oint latch tool can be installed.\n\n_i\'\n\nhandle_ and a mounting adapte_.

The rope\ncan be pulled frownthe winch with a 4.45-newton (I pound) force by placing the\ncontrol handle momentarily to GEAR RELEASE to release the load on the reel\nratchet and then to REEL OUT, and moving the ratchet control lever to the NEUTRAL position. The rope can be extended but will not automatically retract\nwith the controls in this position. When the crewmember returns to the winch,\nslack rope is automatically retracted by placing the controls to RATCHET OUT\na_d NEUTRAL. A load of 2669 newtons (600 pounds) can be applied on the rope\nby placing the controls to RATCHET IN and ENGAGE and either cranking or racheti_g the ratchet handle. When that load is reached, a torque limiter incorporated in the handle allows it to "collapse" approximately 15\xc2\xb0. This is verified\nby misalinement of indicator marks on the handle and also by feeling the handle\nsuddenly give way. _. this occurs, the crewraemberfinds the obstruction to\ndoor movement, removes it, and completes closing the door.\nThe rope can be safely extended under load by placing the controls in\nthe RATCHET OUT and ENGAGE positions and applying a load on the ratchet handle\nand then releasing it.

Eight of these\ntools (enough to bypass two gangs of latches) will be-ca_ied on the first\nOrbiter.f Li gh.r_\nDesigw criteria for this tool recruitedthat the tool must fit all 16\nlatches, must be able to be installed and close a door that is 5.1 centimeters (2 inches) open with the number 1 latch hook 37\xc2\xb0 or more from being\nclosed, must withstand design reentry loads on the latch, must transmit these\nloads into the latch pivot points wish similar magnitudes and directions as\nthe latch mechanisms, and must retain itsel_ in position wh_le being used by\nthe crewmember.\nThe three-point latch tool (fig. 7) consists of a _rame of two parallel\nplates, a compensator that pi_ots in the _rame and att-ches to the nt_t,a\nscrew turned by a ratchet, and a bellcrank. The ratchet handle hinges to conserve stowage space. The force required to retain the tool in place is supplied by a spring-loaded telescoping pi_ot held in the compressed position\nby a release catch. The trigger to release this catch is mounted on the\nhandle, requiring that the rod that releases the catch also hinge at the same\npoint as the handle. The catch also incorporates a means to lock the ratchet\nhandle offset 30\xc2\xb0 on either side of the tool to aid _n installing the tool.\nReleasing the telescoping pivot also releases the ratchet handle positioning\nfolk; however, a position release button Ls--providedto reposition the handle\nin the desired position.\nThe tool is installed by first straightening the handle and offsetting it\nto the desired side (fig. 7(a)). The hook portion of the frame is fitted on\nthe latch hook pivot shaft (fig. 7(b)) with the frame plates straddling the\nlatch hook, which may be in any position greater than 37\xc2\xb0 from the closed position. The frame is then rotated until it contacts the bellcrank pivot. The\ntelescoping pivot is released (fig. 7(c)), forcing the tool betlcrank against\nthe hook roller, and the nut forces the compensator against the bellcrank\npivot. In this configuration, the tool will hold itself in position while Ihe\ncrewmember extends the screw by means of the ratchet until a force is exerted\non the hook roller, closing and securing the door (fig. 7(d)).\n\n22\n\nOne tool\nis i\xc2\xa2gtalled\non _h\nl_tch\nnor,\nsCa_rtir_\nwi_h umber\nI and proceeding\n\xc2\xa2_osing\ntb.e door at each position\nbefore\nirmuatling\nthe last\nre_glred\nthree-polnt\ntO enter\nehe c_\xc2\xa2W medic.\n\niu\n\nthe disabled gang _n _ho same manin ordeg\nto the number 4 latch,\nproceeding\nto the next\nlatch.\nAfter\nlatch tool,\nthe cre_nembar\nis ready\n\nBOLT EXTRACTOR\n\n:\n\nIf the actuator of a gang of bulkhead latches fails such that a latch\nhook prevents installation of the tliree-point latch tool, the gang linkage\nmust be disconnected from the-disabled actuator.\nThe bolt extractor (fig.\n8)\nwas-.d_signed for this task.\nThe linkage is attached to the actuator through a clevis joint using a\nshoulder bolt as the connecting pin. Removal of the bolt is required to disconnect the linkage.\nA force can be expected to be transmitted acro_S the\njoint at the tim_ of. removal.\nThe bolt extractor consists of an expanding frame that straddles the\nclevis, a socket that turns the bolt, and an extractor that pulls the bolt\nf_ee after the nttt is removed.\nTo operate the tool, the nut retaining slot in\nthe frame_ is fitted, completely ou the nut and held in place while the tool is\nsqueezed at points A--and B. This compresses the _ame until the socket confacts the bolthea_.\nWith pressure still being applied at points A and B, the\nbolthe_d socket handle is turned to aline the socket with the bolthead and the\ntool--can-be fully installecL-on the bolthead.\nThe nut retainer keeps the nut from turning and also holds it against the\nclevis while the bolt is unscrewed.\nWhen the bolt threads have cleared the\nnut, the bolthead has been pushed into the socket past the extractor hooks.\nThe bolt removal ratchet is then ratcheted back and forth to force the extractor away from the clevis and pull the holt out. The tool will then slip off\nthe clevis and the bolt can be removed _rom the socket.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThree bolt extractors will b_ taken on Shi,\nttle flights, normally making\nit unnecessary to re_et the tool _or further u_e.\nThe tool can be reset in\nflight if required, however, by holding the frame at point A and li_ting up on\nthe ratchet latches and point B simultaneously.\nThe reset disk is turned to\nmove the extractor\nend socket\ninto position\nagainst\nthe upper\npart\nof the\nframe.\nThe same procedure is followed to remove any other bolts necessary to\nprepar_ the latch system to accept the three-point latch tool.\nWith the required bolts removed from the clevis joi_ts, the latch gangs\ncan be manually moved to rotate the latch hooks, thus allowing the three-polnt\nlatch tool to be installed and door closure to be completed.\n\n23\n\ni\n\nI\n\nEach o\xc2\xa3 the door Cloottrc tools\n\nhas _dergon_\n\na period\n\n0._ d_velopmeut _nd\n\navaLuatlo_-by\nc_e_nuembe_s and _A\nofficials\n_d .t_s _epeatedly\nbeen\nst_cccss i.u the Ne_:_.al l$_oysucy Faciligy\nat the Johusov_.
