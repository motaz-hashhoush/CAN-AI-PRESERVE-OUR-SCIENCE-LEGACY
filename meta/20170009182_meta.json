The purpose of the requirements document is to provide battery designers with information on design provisions to be incorporated in and around the battery and on the verification to be undertaken to demonstrate a safe battery is provided. The term \"safe battery\" means that the battery is safe for ground personnel and crew members to handle and use; safe to be used in the enclosed environment of a crewed space vehicle; and safe to be mounted or used in unpressurized spaces adjacent to habitable areas. Battery design review, approval, and certification is required before the batteries can be used for ground operations and be certified for flight.", "title": "Crewed Space Vehicle Battery Safety Requirements Revision D", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2017-09-28T16:49:14.3270000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20170009182, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Russell, Samuel"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "c09e0e571ef4485aad02ad5a0150b2d9"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Standard/Specification", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20170009182, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170009182, "id": "92183843867a4bdb96b36c25b8c5198d", "publicationDate": "2017-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170009182.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170009182/downloads/20170009182.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170009182/downloads/20170009182.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170009182/downloads/20170009182.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
