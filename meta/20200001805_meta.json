These X-ray amorphous materials are commonly ironrich and aluminum poor and likely some of them are weathering products rather than primary glasses due to the presence of volatiles. Outstanding questions remain regarding the chemical composition and mineral structure of these X-ray amorphous materials and the smectites present at Gale crater and what they indicate about environmental conditions during their formation. To gain a better understanding of the mineral transitions that occur within ferromagnesian parent materials, we have investigated the development of secondary clay minerals and shortrange order materials in two soil chronosequences with varying climates developing on ultramafic bedrock. Field Sites: We investigated soil weathering within two field locations, the Klamath Mountains of Northern California, and the Tablelands of Newfoundland, Canada. Both sites possess age dated or correlated recently deglaciated soils and undated but substantially older soils. In the Klamath mountains the Trinity Ultramafic Body was deglaciated roughly 15,000 years bp while in the Tablelands a moraine was dated to about 17,600 years bp. The Klamath Mountains feature a seasonally wet and dry climate while the Tablelands are wet year-round with saturated soil conditions observed during sampling and standing water observed within 3 of 4 soil pit sampling locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20200001805, "endDate": "2020-03-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI)", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "meetingId": "6d4064a993324fd78caa7a11ab115d9f", "id": "474274934be34eb9a244b369afbe5bfd"}], "name": "Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC)", "location": "The Woodlands, TX", "id": "6d4064a993324fd78caa7a11ab115d9f", "startDate": "2020-03-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20200001805, "id": "64d5893ec50f4f289c51d9bcc6b65880", "publicationDate": "2020-03-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20200001805.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20200001805/downloads/20200001805.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20200001805/downloads/20200001805.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20200001805/downloads/20200001805.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
