In addition to their application as a training tool for pilots, simulators have become essential in the design, construction, and testing of new aircraft. Simulators allow engineers to study an aircraft's flight performance and characteristics without the cost or risk of an actual test flight. Because of their practicality, simulators will become more and more important in the development and design of new, safer aircraft.", "title": "The vertical motion simulator", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T23:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890009013, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hosein, Todd"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "99bf1f46c79246a6908f755f8f5c1322"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890009013, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890009013, "id": "e794e78d163a48778717bbae3e1beb84", "publicationName": "NASA Ames Summer High School Apprenticeship Research Program: 1986 Research Papers", "publicationDate": "1988-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890009013.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890009013/downloads/19890009013.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890009013/downloads/19890009013.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890009013/downloads/19890009013.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
