At low operating temperatures, commercially available electrode materials for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries do not meet energy and power requirements for NASA's planned exploration activities. NEI Corporation, in partnership with the University of California, San Diego, has developed layered composite cathode materials that increase power and energy densities at temperatures as low as 0 degC and considerably reduce the overall volume and weight of battery packs. In Phase I of the project, through innovations in the structure and morphology of composite electrode particles, the partners successfully demonstrated an energy density exceeding 1,000 Wh/kg at 4 V at room temperature. In Phase II, the team enhanced the kinetics of Li-ion transport and electronic conductivity at 0 degC. An important feature of the composite cathode is that it has at least two components that are structurally integrated. The layered material is electrochemically inactive; however, upon structural integration with a spinel material, the layered material can be electrochemically activated and deliver a large amount of energy with stable cycling.", "title": "High-Capacity, High-Voltage Composite Oxide Cathode Materials", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2016-04-26T17:00:50.3070000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20160005364, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hagh, Nader M."}, "organization": {"name": "NEI Corp.", "location": "Somerset, NJ, United States"}}, "id": "d3bb5ed904144df5b3636f9b49ad4d38"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20160005364, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160005364, "id": "5f0b6cbe06fe457e8f15d21884afd39b", "publicationName": "An Overview of SBIR Phase 2 Materials Structures for Extreme Environments", "publicationDate": "2015-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20150018400, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "An Overview of SBIR Phase 2 Materials Structures for Extreme Environments", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160005364.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160005364/downloads/20160005364.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160005364/downloads/20160005364.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160005364/downloads/20160005364.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
