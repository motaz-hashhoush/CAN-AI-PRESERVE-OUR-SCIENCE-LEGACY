This concept leverages elements  developed through the UAS Traffic Management project with respect to a cooperative, service-based approach that provides services and capabilities in areas (e.g., Upper E airspace) that currently receive no or limited service from Air Traffic Control. This concept is meant to provide a safe, fair, and scalable approach to management of Upper E operations that reduces the burden on ATC while providing the flexibility and access desired by current and new users of the airspace. This set of slides includes partner feedback on the following concept elements: Upper E Traffic Management (ETM) planning processes, transit phase of operation, data sharing, time horizons for data sharing, and cooperative integration of military operations. An additional segment of the slides consists of an overview of the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) concept and its relationship to ETM.
