b'By utilizing an input file provided by\nthe lander team, along with a managed\nconfiguration file, the MRO relay\nSASF/PTF generation software runs\nMRO\xe2\x80\x99s MTT (Mars Target Tool) software recursively to construct the Relay\nPTF. It also references these same input\nproducts to generate the SASFs needed\nto support the overflight. Each SASF has\n\nall of the parameters and commanding\nrequired to instruct MRO to initiate the\nrelay session and to configure the onboard radio to transfer data to and from\nthe landed asset. In addition, the software performs version checking on the\ncurrent input file and determines any\nmodifications to the file from any previous version. If instructed, it will output\n\nonly that information which is relevant\nto the changed entries.\nThis work was done by Roy E.

Four windows are\ndisplayed: a \xe2\x80\x9ccam\xe2\x80\x9d window shows a 3D\nview of the satellite; a second window\nshows the standard position plot of the\n\nsatellite on a Mercator map of the\nEarth; a third window displays star\ntracker fields of view, showing which\nstars are visible from the spacecraft in\norder to verify star tracking; and the\nfourth window depicts Sun sensor\nmeasurements, enabling verification of\nthe solar array deployment state. Each\nof these windows has telltales showing\nuseful information applicable to each\nwindow, such as spacecraft axes, magnetic field vectors, the Sun-pointing direction, and the like. These can be tog-\n\ngled on or off as desired. By breaking\nup the data into applicable windows, it\nis easier to monitor specific data of interest. Because the displays operate in\nreal time and visually, any changes to\nthe spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s configuration or attitude are seen immediately. This allows\nfor fast and intuitive spacecraft geometry assessment.\nThis work was done by Eric T. Stoneking\nand Dean Tsai of Goddard Space Flight Center.

GSC-15572-1\n\nRobot Vision Library\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThe JPL Robot Vision Library (JPLV)\nprovides real-time robot vision algorithms for developers who are not vision\nspecialists. The package includes algorithms for stereo ranging, visual odometry and unsurveyed camera calibration,\nand has unique support for very wideangle lenses (as used on the Mars Exploration Rover HazCams). JPLV gathers\nthese algorithms into one uniform, documented, and tested package with a con-\n\nsistent C API (application programming\ninterface). The software is designed for\nreal-time execution (10\xe2\x80\x9320 Hz) on\nCOTS (commercial, off-the-shelf) workstations and embedded processors.\nThis package incorporates algorithms\ndeveloped over more than ten years of\nresearch in ground and planetary robotics for NASA, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and\nthe Army Research Labs, and is cur-\n\nrently being used in applications as diverse as legged vehicle navigation and\nlarge-scale urban modeling.\nThis work was done by Andrew B.

Goldberg of Indelible Systems for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

The software\nprovides an integrated, simplified, and\nflexible system that can be easily maintained to serve the needs of future missions in need of navigation services.\n\nMONTE has an integrated case management system that allows users to create\ntaxonomies to describe and categorize\nruns. It has the ability to plot and display\nmultiple cases and scenarios simultaneously, using color to differentiate, allowing\nfor side-by-side analysis. Users can define\n\n53\n\n'
