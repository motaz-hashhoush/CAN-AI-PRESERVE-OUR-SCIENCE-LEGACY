b'Collaboration of the NASA Glenn\nResearch Center and Rolls-Royce\nDeveloped Thin Film Multilayered\nDielectrics for Harsh Environments\nThe use of thin films to electrically insulate thin film sensors on engine components\nminimizes the intrusiveness of the sensors and allows a more accurate measurement of the\nenvironment. A variety of insulating films were investigated for preventing electrical\nshorting caused by insulator failure between the sensor and the component. By alternating\nlayers of sputtered high-temperature ceramics, a sequence of insulating layers was devised\nthat (1) prevents pinholes from forming completely through the insulator and (2) maintains\nhigh electrical resistivity at high temperatures. The total thickness is only a fraction of that\nneeded for conventional insulating techniques.\nThe Sensors and Electronics Technology Branch of the NASA Glenn Research Center has\nan in-house effort to develop thin film sensors for surface measurement in propulsion\nsystem research. Thin film sensors do not require special machining of the components on\nwhich they are mounted, and they are considerably thinner (less than 10 \xc2\xb5m thick) than\nwire or foil sensors. The thin film sensors are thus much less disturbing to the operating\nenvironment and have a minimal impact on the physical characteristics of the supporting\ncomponent.\nTo further this research, NASA Glenn and Rolls-Royce (Derby, UK), with assistance from\nthe Ohio Aerospace Institute (OAI) and the Akima Corporation, pursued a joint\ninvestigation using multilayered thin film dielectrics as a reliable insulator in harsh\nenvironments. The use of a multilayered scheme is thought to be promising for the\nfabrication of electrically insulating thin films. A major cause of conduction in thin film\ndielectrics is the presence of defects, such as pinholes, that propagate through the film to\nthe underlying substrate surface. By alternating the insulating material, each new growth\npattern would deviate from the previous one, eliminating direct pathways for conduction\nto the substrate.\nThe film depositions and testing were conducted in the Instrument Research Laboratory at\nGlenn. The multilayered insulator test samples were made from alumina and stainless steel\nshims that were first covered with a sputtered underlayer of either yttria-stabilized zirconia\nor chromium carbide, and then overcoated with a sputtered top layer of alumina. An\nexample of a test sample is shown in the following photograph. Each multilayered\ninsulator sample was 5 \xc2\xb5m thick, at least an order of magnitude thinner than conventional\ninsulators. The insulating properties of the samples were tested in a high-temperature air\noven to determine their suitability.\n\nZirconia-alumina multilayer on a metal substrate.\nThe multilayer insulators tested showed a stabilized film at temperatures in excess of 800\n\xc2\xb0C (1472 \xc2\xb0F). The underlying materials in these multilayers allow thermal expansion\nstresses produced during the heating to be graded. The chromium carbide-alumina\nmultilayer had the best adhesion at high temperatures, presumably from the induced\nchemical bonding between the substrate and the chromium carbide underlayer. However,\nthe zirconia-alumina multilayer proved to have slightly better insulating properties when\nadhering.\nThe application of the zirconia-alumina insulator has been demonstrated on a nickel-alloy\nfan blade, as shown in the next photograph. The insulators using thin film sensors still\nneed to be tested in a relevant high-temperature combustion environment.\n\nZirconia-alumina multilayer insulating a resistance temperature detector on a nickelalloy fan blade.\nGlenn contact: John Wrbanek, 216-433-2077, John.D.Wrbanek@nasa.gov; and Gus\nFralick, 216-433-3645, Gustave.C.Fralick@nasa.gov\nAuthors: John D.
