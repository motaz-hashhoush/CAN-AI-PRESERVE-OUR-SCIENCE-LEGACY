That\'s because\na raw laser diode is a fragile and\nhighly volatile device with extreme\nthreshold behavior that will quickly\n"blow up" under unstable environmental conditions. The typical laser\ndiode is capable of turning on in "one\nmillionth" of a second... and one very\nshort "mistake" usually results in total\ndestruction, rendering the laser diode\nuseless. Applied Laser Systems\n(ALS) has solved this problem and\nmakes the laser diode usable in the\nreal world.\nSo, while it may seem practical to\nengineer your laser product "from the\nground up," it makes far more sense to\nbypass the frustrating process of\ntrying to stabilize the laser diode by\nsimply "plugging in" our patented\n\nVLM\'" product directly into your application. Our modular system is so\nuser friendly, all you have to do is add\na power supply.\nSimply put, the ALS Visible\nLaser Module, or VLM\'" product is\nthe most advanced laser module\nsystem on the market today. Our\nminiature design incorporates the\nlaser diode, drive circuits, and\nsophisticated optics into one tiny,\nself-contained, shock resistant\npackage, allowing us to maximize\npower efficiency while protecting the\ninternal circuitry from electro-static\ndischarge, spiking overload and\nreverse polarity. In short, the-VLM\'"\nproduct makes the fragile laser diode\nvirtually indestructible.\nAnd with a field failure rate of\nless than 1 percent, Applied Laser\nSystems supports its products with\na full two year warranty, setting\nthe industry standard. In addition,\na small green LED indicator is\nmounted on the rear of each\nmodule to indicate when the laser\nis operating .. .a safety factor that\nALS alone provides.\n\nThe versatile VLM\'" product\ncomes ready-to-use in a variety of\nbeam configurations and wavelengths, in both the visible and infrared bands. Modules can easily be\nintegrated into a wide variety of\napplications that require precision\nand accuracy, such as alignment\nand positioning, counting and timing,\nsignal transmission, testing and\nmeasurement, and illumination ...\nright out of the box.\nWhy waste critical R&D funds on\ncostly experimentation?

Attia, and\nGerald Harpert, Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory\nLithium-based batteries have the high energy density and low weight needed for\nadvanced space, communications, and automotive applications. However, lithium is\nhighly reactive with most inorganic and organiC electrolytes, which results in lower\ncycling efficiency. Further, prolonged cycling produces large quantities of dendritic\n\nlithium, increasing the risk of thermal runaway. Using M92Si as an anode material at\nambient temperature results in formation of\ncrystalline U ,M92 Si that offers superior stability towards organic electrolytes, a large\ncapacity for lithium storage, good reversibility,\nand satisfactory mechanical strength after\ncycling. Since there is no free lithium available, there is no dendritic growth.\nFor More Information Write In No. 741\nSystem for Installation and Replacement\nof Components in Hostile Environments\n(US Patent No. 5,290, 121)\nInventors: James L.

Based on\nmonthly observations of climate, sunlight,\nand ground vegetation, the model simulates the planet removing C02 from the\natmosphere during plant photosynthesis\nand releasing it as soil microbes decompose plant debris.\nGases such as C02 reside in the atmosphere and absorb long-wave radiation emitted by the planet\'s surface. Increases in their concentrations could trap\nheat in the atmosphere and gradually\nwarm the planet, resulting in an increasing "greenhouse effect."\nMany of the fundamental questions\nabout the global carbon cycle can be\naddressed using simulations such as\nthe Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach\n(CASA) model, which emulates seasonal\npattems in the functions and interactions\nof the biosphere and atmosphere. The\nCASA model is a product of Ames\' Earth\nSystem Science Division in cooperation\nwith the Camegie Institute and Stanford\n\nS\n\n16\n\n~\n\n~\n\nThis computer-generated global projection emulates patterns in the production and\nabsorption of C02 by the Earth \'s land and atmosphere in a typical June. Areas where\nplant growth results in a net C02 uptake are green; red indicates net C02 release from\ndecay of plant matter by soil microbes.\n\nUniversity faculty and is funded by\nNASA\'s Office of Mission to Planet Earth.\nCASA is the first ecosystem carbon\nflux model to incorporate satellite images\nof the global land surface, collected by\nthe Advanced Very High Resolution\nRadiometer (AVHRR), a sensor aboard the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration\'s NOAA-9 environmental\nobservation satellite. Launched in the late\n1970s to provide more global and continuous coverage of ecological phenomena, the sensor gives a detailed assessment of vegetation density in relatively\nsmall areas. "We\'ve gone from the resolution of a climate model cell, about the size\nof Colorado, to an area approximately 60\nmiles square," said Ames/Johnson Controls research scientist Christopher Potter.\nThe AVHRR takes readings of infrared\nlight which, when combined with groundbased temperature, preCipitation, and\nsolar radiation readings, yield an estimate\nof net photosynthesis. The model also\ntakes into account soil texture and vegetation type-leafy material, twigs and\nstems, rotting wood, and roots-important because different types of plant\n\nmaterial decompose at different rates.\n"By developing correlations between\nthe raw data from both fieldwork and satellites, we\'re able to combine them into\nsomething useful," said Ames researcher\nSteven Klooster. "In the past, we could\nlook only at directly sensible things such\nas temperature from satellites. Modeling\nenables us to produce a map of C02 distribution, something not directly sensible."\nThe model shows that annual production of C02 from soils is at least ten times\nthe annual increase of CO2 in the atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion. However, C02 from plant decay is balanced\nby the annual uptake during plant growth,\nwhereas even a slight imbalance caused\nby human activities such as buming fossil\nfuels and deforestation could have a dramatic effect. Any small degree of global\nwarming could cause temperature-sensitive soil microbes to decompose organic\nmatter more rapidly, thereby releasing\nmore C02 into the atmosphere. Elevated\nC02 WOUld, in tum, raise temperatures\nfurther to renew the cycle.\n"With the Simulation, we begin to see\nlocal processes applied on a global scale,"\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1994\n\nKlooster said . "This carbon has been\nstored in the soils for tens of thousands if\nnot millions of years and man\'s recent\nactivity has begun releasing it."\nThe researchers\' next step is to extend\nthe simulation to ten years. "We have\nglobal satellite imagery and real climate\nmeasurements-not just long-term averages-for the last decade," said Potter.\n"These can be significantly affected by\nthe types of volcanic eruptions and EI\nNino events we\'ve had in recent years.\nOur goal is to determine how sensitive\nthis breathing process is to year-to-year\nchanges in climate."\nIndependent measurements help to\nverify and refine the simulation. "There are\nup to 50 sites around the planet where\nscientists have been collecting data for\nyears," said Klooster. "We\'ve used that\ndata to make the model more realistic."\nThe team also is looking for ways to\nbridge the gap between global coverage,\nfor which there is only monthly satellite\ndata, and daily and even hourly processes that may influence the carbon flux.\n"We know from field experiments that\nthere are processes occurring on shorter\nintervals that are very important-such as\n\nCASA has yielded clues to its own\nrefinement. "We\'ve discovered that information about soil texture is critical in reproducing the proper breathing sequence,\nyet the available soil data is less reliable\nthan what we have for climate and from\nthe satellite," Potter said. "Many areas are\ndifficult to sample or even inaccessible,\nsuch as the northem tundra. Soils data\nstands out as an area in which we need\ninternational scientific cooperation for\nimprovement."\nPotter said it also has proven difficult\nto simulate areas converted to permanent agriculture because of limited understanding of how human management affects the ecosystem. "We know from experimentation that if humans are disturbing the soil, tilling it for example, the rates\nat which microbes metabolize are accelerated. In trying to model the subtleties of\nthe system, transitions caused by humans\nbecome very important, yet the global\nsatellite doesn\'t piCk them up."\nTo address such distinctions in land\ncharacteristics, the researchers employ a\ntechnology known as the Geographic\nInformation System (GIS), which provides\nlayers of data representing continuous\n\nwhen it warms up very quickly and plants\nburst into activity in the northem regions,"\nexplained Potter. \'\'These critical transition\nperiods are averaged out when you look\nat months or seasons, but we\'re trying to\nrepresent them mathematically to make\nthe model more realistic."\n\ninformation on climate and vegetation .\nIndividual calculations are carried out at\neach of the global model\'s 14,000 grid\ncells before the simulation is constructed.\nThis permits application of a slightly different algorithm in cells designated as cultivated land. The team hopes to apply the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1994\n\nsame technique to distinguish areas receiving applications of chemical fertilizers.\nAccording to Potter, the CASA model\ncould be used to study the role of forests\nand land use in global biochemical\ncycles, such as the effect on atmospheric\nC~ as rainforest is replaced by farmland.\nOther potential uses include determining\nthe effects of population increases and\nirrigation techniques, as well as studying\nother important greenhouse gases such\nas nitrous oxide and methane.\nUnderstanding the links between large\nenvironmental systems, such as the\nEarth\'s land surface and the atmosphere,\nis a fundamental goal of NASA\'s Mission\nto Planet Earth. By collecting, analyzing,\nand distributing its findings, the project\nhopes to support informed policy decisions regarding human action and its\neffects on the Earth\'s environment. 0\n\nFor more information about the technologies described above, contact Christopher Potter, NASA Ames Research\nCenter, Mail Stop 242-4, Moffett Field,\nCA 94035-1000, Tel: 415-604-6164,\nFax: 415-604-4680.\n\nThe above map, computed from satellite, climate, and soils databases in the\nCASA biosphere model, illustrates the\nfixation of C02 by plants in June after\ncorrecting for metabolic requirements.\n\n17\n\nNew Produclldeas\nNew Product Ideas are just\na few of the many Innovations\ndescribed In this Issue of\nNASA Tech Briefs and having\npromising commercial applications.

The\nresonant frequencies and the variations\n(dispersion) in the frequency intervals between resonant modes are directly related\nto the attenuation, phase velocity, and characteristic impedance of a transmission\nline. At lower frequencies, a superconducting transmission line is expected to be\nlossless and nearly dispersionless. As the\nfrequency rises toward and through the\nsuperconducting energy-gap frequency\nfg = 2tJh (where ~ is the superconductor\nenergy-gap parameter and h is Planck\'s\nconstant), one expects to see the onset of\ngreater dispersion , with mode spacing\ndecreasing to a minimum at a frequency\nslightly above fg. At frequencies well above\nfg, one expects the superconductor to\n5ehave as a normal metal.\nFigure 1 illustrates an Nb/AIOx/Nb\nJosephson junction fabricated integrally\nand electrically in parallel with an Nb/\nSiOx/Nb microstrip transmission line. In\nits voltage-controlled-oscillator function, the\njunction provides a signal of frequency f =\n2eV/h, where e is the fundamental unit\nof electric charge and V is the dc bias\nvoltage across the junction. This signal sets\nup a standing wave in the resonator\nformed by the combination of the junction capacitance and the input admittance\nof the microstrip transmission line. In its\ndetector function, the junction acts as a\nmixer, responding to the power reflected\n22\n\nfrom the resonator by putting out a dc\ncomponent (I) of current. The maximum\npower is reflected at the resonant frequencies. Thus, as the bias voltage (and,\nthereby, the frequency) is swept, the resulting I-vs.-V curve includes small current\nsteps at the resonant frequencies.\nFigure 2 shows data from such measurements taken on a microstrip transmission line 500 IJm long and 12 IJm\nwide. The measured fg was 660 GHz.\nThe mode spacing was nearly uniform at\nabout 85 GHz at lower frequencies and\n\ndecreased to a minimum of about 50\nGHz at a frequency of 730 GHz. These\nresults were in good agreement with the\ntheoretical prediction, according to which\nthe minimum mode spacing should occur at 740 GHz.\nThis work was done by Hamid H. S.\nJavadi, William R. McGrath, Bruce Bumble,\nand Henry G. LeDuc of Ca/tech for\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor further information, write in 106 on\nthe TSP Request Card.\nNPO-18905\nS iOx Layer\n\nFigure 1.

Signals would be transferred into and out of such a package by\nelectromagnetic coupling via apertures in\nthe structural base of the package. The\nheart of the package is the structural base.\nIt provides the mechanical support for the\nmultilayer dielectrics and active devices. It\nalso incorporates the means to employ a\nphysical interconnection to the extemal\nenvironment via combination of waveguideto-planar and planar-to-planar transmission\nline types. The dielectric layers and the apertures in them would be configured to\nprovide low-loss electromagnetic coupling\nwith transmission-line, waveguide, and/or\ntransition structures outside the package\n(see figure).\nThe basic goal of this development effort is to provide circuit packages that are\nsmall, lightweight, rugged, and inexpensive\nin mass production. Most likely, these packages would be embedded in planar\nmicrostrip and coplanar waveguide circuits, in\nwaveguide-to-planar and planar-to-waveguide circuitry, in waveguide-to-waveguide\ncircuitry, between radiating (antenna) elements, and between planar transmission\n\nlines and radiating elements. Other applications in automotive, communication, radar, remote sensing, and biomedical electronic systems are also foreseen.\nThe variety of potential applications, electromagnetic-coupling configurations, packaging materials, and techniques of fabrication together presents the designer with\nan impressive array of both design requirements and opportunities to satisfy\nthose requirements. The structural base of\na package is of primary interest in this\nregard because it would provide not only\nelectromagnetic coupling as mentioned\nabove but also structural support (as its\nname suggests) and thermal management (e.g., heat sinking) for the circuitry\nwithin the package. Thus, the considerations that would affect the design of the\nstructural base include (but are not limited\nto) the thermal conductivities and coefficients of thermal expansion of the metal,\ndielectric, and packaging materials, the\nelectrical parameters of these materials\nat the intended operating frequency, the\nposition of the package relative to extemal\ncircuitry, mechanical characteristics, and,\nof course, the electromagnetic-coupling\nrequirements.\nNumerous challenges and opportunities\n\nalso arise with regard to the interior of the\npackage. For example, the advanced packaging concept is amenable to the packaging of multilayer circuits, incorporation of\nresonator structures (e.g., cavities), efficient coupling to a single device (e.g.,\ntransistor or diode), efficient coupling to a\nsingle integrated-circuit chip, and efficient\ncoupling to a multiple-chip module. Low-frequency, digital, and optoelectronic circuitry\ncould be placed in the package to handle\ncontrol and data signals.\nA typical hermetic outer housing would\nconsist of side walls and a lid. The side\nwalls could comprise a solid ring of metal\nor dielectric (with or without metal coating).\nDirect-current and/or radio-frequency feedthroughs could be incorporated into the\nside walls. Windows for optical coupling\n(e.g., for control signals) could also be\nincorporated into the lid or side walls.\nThis work was done by Martin I.\nHerman, Karen A. Lee, Lynn E Lowry, Alain\nCarpenter, and Paul Wamhof of Caltech\nfor NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor further information, write in 91 on\nthe TSP Request Card.\nNPO-19094\n\nRadio-Frequency\nSignal Out\n\nRadio-Frequency\nSignal In\nStructural Base\nWith Etched\nExternal Transition\nand Coupling\nApertures\n\n. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~==~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSignals Wou ld Be Coupled Electromag netically between external circuits and electronic devices in the package.\n\n~ Improved Micromachined Transducers\nFeatures would include autonomous commanded calibration, monitoring, and adjustment\nduring operation, and protection when nonoperational.\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nSensor systems of a proposed type\nwould incorporate (1) micromachined silicon-based structures as electrostatic force\nand displacement actuators and (2) micromachined quantum-mechanical-tun-\n\n24\n\nneling electrodes as one form of displacement transducers, along with electronic\ncircuits that would provide multiple electrical\nstimuli to the displacement electrodes for\nmeasurement, calibration, monitoring of\n\nsensor status, and adjustment.

Purely mechanical devices with\nsuch a capability would at best be exorbitantly complicated .\nThe proof mass would be caged by means of a battery, a simple\ntransistor switch , and a thin layer of insulation separating a\nproof-mass platen from a parking platen. In addition, the electrical bias could counteract not only a constant extemal field but\nalso an independently measured or generated varying field .\nCancellation of forces could then be executed within a sensor\nrather than extemal to it, such as where compensation is needed to offset seismic accelerations for measurements of microgravitational accelerations.\nThe purely electrical calibration of a sensor of the proposed\ntype (without stimulating the sensor with the quantity or phenomenon to be measured) would be based on the known relationship between that phenomenon and the force that it exerts on the\nsensor/actuator structure and the known electrostatic force exerted by a known voltage applied to the electrodes in the actuator.\nThese relationships are thermally and temporally invariant; once\nestablished, they could be used to apply calibrating actuator\nsignals equivalent to known levels of the phenomenon to be\nmeasured. The response of a sensor to such calibrating signals\ncould be analyzed to determine the operational status of the sensor,\nto determine frequency response and the thermal and aging characteristics of the sensor, and to compensate digitally for drift in bias\nand other errors in the measurement.\nA continuous, nominally fixed (except for drift with age) electrostatic bias would provide an offset, about which an amplified\nsensitivity scaling or coefficient of response could be established. A\nfixed bias could be used in characterizing the static response of a\nsensor by, for example, supporting a sensor element in a fixed\ngravitational field. This bias technique might be extended to\ndynamic characterization of a sensor in which alternating voltages of\nvarious frequencies and amplitudes would be applied. The potential\nfor such a direct coupling would eliminate the nonlinearities\nand/or phase lags generally associated with extemal excitation and\nenable the precise excitation of ultrasensitive devices.\nTo alternate measurement with calibration and monitoring of status repeatedly during operation, it would be necessary to timemultiplex (1) the calibration-and-monitoring stimulus voltages, the\nnormal operating bias + feedback voltage, and a zero-bias voltage applied to the actuator electrodes and (2) the tunnelingcurrent responses to these voltages. The measurement bandwidth should be N times the bandwidth of the quantity to be\nmeasured, where N is the total number of all multiplexed stimuli\n0ncluding the normal bias plus feedback). The filtered-step-response\ntransfer function for each stimulus must be determined for use in digital correction of the measurement. The aggregated results of the\ndigital processing of responses to these stimuli would provide for\nautomation of the sensor operation with repeated calibration and\ncompensation for changes in offsets and for changes in coefficients of response .\nThis work was done by Frank T.

Pasadena, California\nImproved conceptual designs for the\nwriting conductors in a micromagneVHalleffect random-access integrated-circuit\nmemory would reduce the electrical current\nneeded to magnetize the micromagnet in\neach memory cell. These improvements\nare important for further development of\nmemories of this type because the writing\ncurrents needed in simplistic prior designs\nare too large to be handled conveniently by\nmodest-sized transistors that would normally be used in such memories.\nThe basic concept of the micromagnet/Hall-effect random-access memory\nwas presented in "Magnetic Analog Random-Access Memory" (NPO-17999),\nNASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 15, No. 11 (Novem-\n\n_ _.....~I\n\nMicromagnet\n\nt (Below Conductor)\n\ni-7-,.-7-T7-h""\';"\':.,-7-i-771\n\n.t t t t\n\nt t t t,\n\nCu~rent\n\nSIMPLISTIC DESIGN\n(CONDUCTOR IS ESSENTIALLY\nA HALF-TURN COIL)\n\nConductor\n\nber 1991 ), page 30. As described in more\ndetail in that article, each memory cell\naccording to the Simplistic design concept\nwould include an essentially planar strip of\nferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material (the\nmicromagnet that serves as the storage\nelement) and a simple, essentially planar\nconductor strip separated by a thin layer of\ninsulating material. The current in the conductor would induce a magnetic field substantially in the plane. The magnetomotive\nforce would be proportional to the current\ndensity (current per unit width) in the conductor. The top part of the figure is a\nschematic illustration of the writing conductor and micromagnet in a typical simplistic design.\nThe middle part of the figure shows an\nimproved design in which gaps would be\nintroduced into the conductor to concentrate the current into narrow strips, beneath\nwhich the magnetomotive force would be\ngreater in proportion to the increase in current density as long as the spacing\nbetween the conductor and the magnetic\nmaterial is thin compared to the thickness\nof the conductor. Provided that the width\nof the gaps is much greater than the thickness of the insulating layer between the\nconductor and the micromagnet, and\nassuming that the magnetic material is\nhighly permeable, the current needed to\nmagnetize to the same degree as in the\nequivalent simplistiC design would be\napproximately proportional to the ratio\nbetween (1) the total width of the remaining conducting strips and (2) the Original\nwidth of the simplistiC conductor. Given\n\nthe dimensions shown in the figure, about\nhalf the current would be needed.\nThe lower part of the figure shows\nanother improved design that reduces the\nneeded magnetizing current to one twentyfifth that of the simplistic design. The width\nof the conductive strip would be reduced\nto one-fifth the width of the simplistic\ndesign, thereby multiplying the current density and the local magnetomotive force by\n5. To multiply the magnetomotive force by\nanother factor of 5 (thereby obtaining an\noverall multiplication of 25), the conductor\nWOUld, in effect, be wrapped around the\nmicromagnet in a 2i-l!-tum coil. Of course,\nthis would necessitate an additional layer\nof metal below the micromagnet and additional integrated-circuit-fabrication steps\nto form the lower half tums of the coil.\n\nThis work was done by Jiin-chuan Wu,\nHenry L.

This codec can handle digital\nsignals at data rates up to 300 Mbps,\ndepending on the particular modulation\nformat (with proper extemal data-formatting logic circuitry, it can be used with any\ntype of modulation).\nThe ASIC features a low-power complementary metal oxide/semiconductor standard\ncell design containing about 18,000 equivalent gates. It is mounted in a 132-lead\npin-grid-array package. It includes flexible interface circuitry that can be configured\nto accept data in widths of 1, 2, 4, or 8\nbits and in blocks of varying total sizes from\n256 to 512 bits in increments of 16 bits. In\naddition, coding can be tumed on and off\non a burst-by-burst basis without altering the throughput delay.\nThe coder and decoder are independent of each other. The decoder can correct all patterns of 3 or less errors per\nblock. The only other circuit known (as of\n1992) to be competitive and commercially available is limited to a data rate of 30\nMbps and to correction of no more than 2\nerrors in a codeword that has a fixed size\nof 51 1 bits.\nThis codec can provide up to 4 dB of\ncoding gain without soft decision information at a bit -error rate of 10-8 at code\nrates frorn %to 15/16.

The primary reason for choosing a single-barrier varactor instead of another nonlinear device (e.g., a Schottky varactor)\nis that unlike the other devices, the single-barrier varactor has a symmetrical\ncapacitance-vs. -voltage characteristic and\nan antisymmetrical zero-frequency currentvs.-voltage characteristic.

The Single-Barrier Varactor has a symmetrical capacitance-vs.-voltage characteristic\nand an antisymmetrical dc current-vs.-voltage characteristic. As a result, this varactor generates\nonly odd-ha rmonic currents when a radio-freq uency voltage is applied at zero dc bias.\n\n36\n\n1,000 A thick, Ni 200 A thick, and Au\n1,600 A thick. The top contact is made\nwith a whisker, and the bottom contact is a\nlarge-area ohmic contact. The conduction\ncurrent through the varactor is blocked\nby the AI0.7Gao.3As barrier.\nThermionic emission is the primary\ncause of the conduction current at moderate voltages. A variation in bias voltage\nchanges the width of the depleted part\nof the moderately doped epitaxial layer,\nthereby forming a voltage-dependent\ncapacitance. The minimum capacitance,\ndetermined by the concentration of dopant\nand the width of the moderately doped\ndrift region, is obtained at maximum bias\nvottage. The maximum capacitance, determined by the thickness of the\nAI0.7Gao.3As barrier, is obtained at zero\nbias voltage. An appropriate design is\nexpected to yield a capacitance-vs.-voltage characteristic similar to that of a\nSchottky varactor diode in reverse bias.\nThe radio-frequency current is maximum\nat zero bias because the capacitance is\nmaximum there. At zero bias, the drift regions on both sides of the barrier are undepleted. Thus, this varactor exhibits larger\nlosses attributable to dynamic series resistance than do Schottky varactors.\nThe embedding impedances needed\nto optimize the performance of the single-barrier varactor as a tripler are 7 to\n30 Q resistive, 40 to 100 Q reactive in\nthe input circuit, and 15 to 42 Q reactive in\nthe output circuit. These impedances are\nprovided by the crossed-waveguide\nmount, wherein the varactor is mounted\nacross the output waveguide. In Figure\n2, the output waveguide is shown schematically parallel to the input waveguide,\nbut in a more realistic rendering it would\nbe oriented perpendicular to the page.\nThe output waveguide has reduced\nheight (0.99 mm), and a transition to a\nfull-height WR4 waveguide is integrated\ninto the mount.\nThe fundamental-frequency pump (input) power is fed to the varactor via a\nlow-pass filter that consists of a pattem of\ngold 2 ~m thick on a quartz substrate\n76.2 ~m thick and 0.71 mm wide.

PWM control can satisfy voltage-regulation tolerances much\nsmaller than the increments of discrete\ncontrol, and can respond to transients,\nbut involves large switching losses and\nnecessitates a large capacitor to suppress\nripple. In the discrete/PWM control ballastresistor controller, the discrete method\ncan be regarded as providing the coarse\nvoltage adjustment, while the PWM\n38\n\nFigure 1.

Bus voltage is\nregulated with low bus impedance and\nlow switching loss. In addition, the discrete/PNM ballast-resistor controller compensates automatically for an open- or\nshort-circuited ballast resistor.\nThe discrete/PNM ballast -resistor controller contains N normally active plus M\nspare ballast resistors, each controlled by\na corresponding comparator output SO, ..\nSN+M-1 (see Figure 1). The pUlse-repetition period is 1$. During each period, current source r gives rise to a ramp waveform up to a maximum voltage of\nacross the capacitor. Meanwhile, approximately equal current source I gives\nrise to voltage drops, in increments of IR,\nacross the resistors.\nThrough the combined actions of the\nmetal oxide semiconductor field-effect\ntransistor (MOSFET), S-R flip-flop, and\ncomparators, the circuit puts out N + M\nramp waveforms, each with ramp height\nrR and progressive offsets of IR (see\nFigure 2).

This hybrid\napproach offers the combined advantages\nof high-speed semiconductor active devices that can be made only on epitaxialIy deposited GaAs substrates with lowdielectric-loss, mechanically rugged quartz\nsubstrates.\nTypically, the GaAs-based integrated circuit in a hybrid circuit of this type is less\nthan 5 ~m thick and contains passive and\nactive discrete circuit elements (e.g., transistors, diodes, and resistors), most of\nwhich are much smaller than the wavelength at operation; the quartz-based circuit\nis much thicker and typically includes integrated stripline circuit elements (e.g., antenna\n40\n\nThis Millimeter-Wave Mixer Circuit includes filters made by the lift-off process, plus a\nseparately mounted GaAs planar diode in a 200-GHz waveguide mount.\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1994\n\nelements, transmission lines, low-pass filters) and possibly dielectric lenses, most of\nwhich have linear dimensions (except thickness) of the order of the wavelength. By\nmaking the GaAs layer much thinner than\nthe wavelength and by keeping it undoped\nexcept in the small regions that contain the\nactive devices, one ensures that the\nmicrowave electromagnetic field generated by the currents in the stripline circuitry\ninteracts with a dielectric medium that consists primarily of the quartz substrate and is\nrelatively unaffected by the GaAs semiconductor material.\nFabrication begins with the epitaxial\ndeposition of an undoped layer of AlAs, 50\nto 75 Athick, on a GaAs wafer. This layer\nis subsequently etched away, as explained\nbelow following an established \'lift-off\'\nprocess developed at Bell Laboratories.\nThe GaAs integrated circuit, including all\npassive and active circuit elements, is fully\nformed on top of the AlAs layer by use of\nepitaxial growth, photolithography, and\nother established techniques. The top surface of the GaAs integrated circuit is coated with black wax dissolved in trichloroethylene , then dried in an oven at a\ntemperature of 160 \xc2\xb0C .\nTo separate the thin integrated circuit\nfrom the GaAs wafer, the AlAs layer is\netched away in a 10-percent solution of\nhydrofluoric acid at O\xc2\xb0C. The black wax is\ncritical to this step in that it places the integrated-circuit layer under slight tension so\nthat it peels up as the etch proceeds\ninward from the edges of the wafer. When\nthe etch is complete, the thin integratedcircuit layer and wax float off the GaAs\nwafer and are removed from the solution.\nThe GaAs integrated-circuit layer, still coated with wax, is attached to the quartz integrated circuit, either by proximity bonding\nor by use of an ultraviolet-cured optical\ncement. The wax is removed by dissolving\nit in trichloroethylene . The resulting\nGaAs/quartz hybrid can then be processed\nby established techniques of chemical\ncleaning, dicing, slight heating, and/or\nbump bonding .\nTest hybrid structures that contain lowpass microstrip filters , micro-airbridges,\nand planar GaAs diodes have been fabricated (see figure). This hybrid approach is\nalso being followed in developing a 640GHz integrated mixer circuit that includes a\npair of planar GaAs diodes in the middle of\ntwo GaAs-on-quartz loW-pass microstrip filters. Other potential applications include\nintegration of antenna elements with active\ndevices, using carrier substrates other than\nquartz to meet particular requirements\n(for example, more-efficient dissipation of\nheat), using the lifted-off GaAs layer in a\nmembrane configuration with the quartz\nsubstrate supporting the edges only, and\nusing the lift-off technique to fabricate\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1994\n\nultrathin discrete devices that can be\ndiced separately and inserted into predefined larger circuits.

The proposed separators would block the growth of lithium\ndendrites and thereby help prevent short circuits. Each cell would contain one separator made of microporous polypropylene placed next to the anode, and one\nseparator made of microporous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (which reacts\nchemically with lithium but not with the\ncell electrolyte) next to the cathode.\nBy helping to prevent short circuits in\ncells, the proposed separators could increase the cycle lives of secondary lithium\ncells. The cells to which this concept is\nexpected to be applicable are those of the\nLi/TiS2 \' Li/NbSe3\' Li/Co02\' Li/MoS2 \'\nLJ/VOx, and LJ/Mn02 chemical systems.\nResearch has shown that the growth of\nlithium dendrites and the attendant shorting\ncould also be prevented by the use of alternative lithium anodes in which the lithium is\nnot in metallic form, but that the specific\nenergy of an AA-size cell that contains such\nan alternative anode is only about 65\nWo\nh/kg. In contrast, an AA-size cell that\ncontains the proposed improved separators\nwould exhibit a specific energy of about\n120 Wo\nh/kg. Cells of this type could prove\nadvantageous in spacecraft, military, communications, automotive, and other applications in which high energy density and\nrechargeability are needed.\nThe currently widely used microporous\nseparators of polypropylene and nonwoven glass paper have been found to be\nincapable of preventing shorting by lithium\ndendrites during repeated charge/ discharge cycling, as shown at the top of the\nfigure. The state-of-the-art separator in current use is of a thermal-fuse type that\nincludes a wax coat on its surface. When\na cell that contains such a separator\nbecomes short-circuited by lithium dendrites, the heat generated by the discharge\nof the cell through the short circuit melts the\nwax, blocking the pores in the separator\nand thus blOCking the transport of electrolyte ions and causing the cell to reach\nan open-circuit condition.\nIn a cell that contained the proposed\nseparators (see bottom of figure) any\ngrowth of a dendrite that was not blocked\nby the inert polypropylene separator and\nthat reached the PTFE separator would\nreact with the PTFE separator. This re42\n\naction would produce only local blockage of pores in the PTFE separator and\nwould thus allow the continued transport\nof electrolyte ions everywhere else through\nthe PTFE separator. Thus, the cell could\ncontinue to function until lithium had reacted with a major portion of the PTFE\nseparator.\nThis work was done by David Shen,\nSubbarao Surampudi, Chen-Kuo Huang,\nand Gerald Halpert of Caftech for NASA\'s\nJet PropulSion Laboratory.

If the predicted\neffects are undesirable in some way (for\nexample, if they include or would lead to\nunstable behavior), then the control signals\nare not passed on to the control actuators;\ninstead, a new set of fuzzy rules is\ninvoked. Thus, undesirable behavior of\nthe system is prevented, and fuzzy rules\nare nested.\nIn addition to increased robustness, anticipatory neurofuzzy control offers the\nadvantage of reduced computing time:\nThe nesting of rules reduces the incidence\nof calls to predictive routines, with consequent decrease of time spent in control\ncomputations.

Typically, the maximum\nmagnitude of the random noise signal is\ncommensurate with the least-significant\nbit of the new, reduced word length. An\nNCO that performs the dithering process\nfor the amplitude samples is shown in\nFigure 2. An equivalent process can be\nperformed on the phase samples. In that\ncase, the reduced-word-Iength dithered\nphase values are sent as input to a lookup table that contains the corresponding\namplitude values .\nThe advantage gained by dithering the\namplitude is that the spurious components in the output at the shorter word\nlength are reduced to the level of the spurious components at the original greater\nword length. The disadvantage is that the\nreduced components are accompanied\nby noise. However, this disadvantage is mitigated by the fact that the noise is either\nspread over the entire sampling frequency\nrange or else concentrated within a passband acceptable for subsequent filtering.\nThe reduced word length enables the\nuse of less-complicated multipliers in purely digital applications. In a typical analog\napplication, this dithering method enables\nthe generation of signals with high nonharmonic spectral purity by use of a fast\nvideo digital-to-analog converter, the word\nlength of which is typically limited to no\nmore than 8 to 12 bits.\nThe advantage gained by dithering the\nphase is either to improve the spurious\nperformance to that of the original longer\nphase word length or else to steepen the\ntypical 6-dB-per-bit falloff of the spurious\ncomponents to 12 dB per bit. Because the\nsize of a sinusoid lookup table is exponentially related to the number of phase\nbits, this dithering technique can dramatically reduce the complexity of an NCO.\nThe noise required for the dithering\nprocess can be generated efficiently in\napproximate form as a pseudonoise sequence by use of a linear feedback shift\nregister.\nThis work was done by George A.\nZimmerman and Michael J.

In the\noriginal application, the hot gas plume is a\nrocket-engine exhaust during a test firing.\nThe darts and launcher may be adaptable to a variety of terrestrial uses like\nresearch on particulate emissions of vol canoes or determining the origin of a bUilding fire while it is still buming .\nThe basic idea is to send darts periodically through the hot gas plume. Doublesticky-sided foil carried by the dart gathers particles en route.\nA dart is first placed on a launch tube,\nwhich in turn is mounted on the outlet\nport of a solenoid-controlled dump valve.\nThe valve is opened, releasing a blast of\nhigh-pressure nitrogen into the tube and\nsending the dart on an approximately parabolic trajectory through the plume (see\nfigure) . The dart is recovered , and the\nsticky foil is removed for examination of\ncollected particles.\nThe pressure of the nitrogen can be\nvaried to adjust the trajectory. For example,\nwith a pressure sufficient to produce a\nlaunch speed of 125 ftls (38 m/s) and with\nthe dart aimed at 80\xc2\xb0 up from horizontal,\nthe dart attains a height of about 235 ft (72\nm) and a range of 166 ft (50.6 m) along a\npurely ballistic trajectory. In practice, the\nplume can give the dart some aerodynamic lift, extending the height and range\nbeyond the purely ballistic values.\nThe dart is made of stainless-steel tubing 1;h in. (38.1 mm) in diameter and 0.095\nin. (2.4 mm) thick. It weighs about 14 Ib\n(about 6.4 kg).\nThis work was done by James F Taylor\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n/\n\nTrajectory\nof Dart\n\n\\\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n/\n\n,\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n/\n\n\\\n\\\n\nThe Dart Travels through a plume of hot gas, gathering particles from the plume.

The two techniques are velocitygradient focusing (VGF), which is suitable\nfor rectangular electrophoresis chambers;\nand field-gradient focusing (FGF), which is\n\nsuitable for step-shaped electrophoresis\nchambers. In VGF, the electrical -field\nstrength, E, is held constant along the\ndirection of electrophoresis (dEldx = 0,\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1994\n\nwhere x, is the position along the direction\nof electrophoresis), whereas the opposing\nelectro-osmotic velocity, Veo , increases\nalong x, as shown in Figure 1. In FGF, Veo is\nheld constant with x, whereas E decreases along x, as shown in Figure 2 .\nThe theoretical basis for both VGF\nand FGF is the Smoluchowski equation, which expresses the relationship\namong Veo , E, and the t; potential of the\nwall:\nwhere D and 11 are the dielectric constant and the viscosity, respectively, of\nthe buffer medium. This equation predicts\nthat for a given buffer (constant D and\nl1),veo can be controlled by varying the t;\npotential of the wall.\nRgure 1 schematically illustrates VGF in\nan open chamber of rectangular cross\nsection. The Veo profile is plug shaped,\nwith the velocity counter to the direction of\nelectrophoresis. Furthermore, the rectangular cross section ensures that E is\nindependent of x. Thus, a series of step\nchanges in I; along x should lead to a\nseries of step changes in V , making it\neo\npossible to focus particles of different\nmobilities in zones of different 1;.\nRgure 2 schematically illustrates FGF in\nan open step-shaped chamber. Again, the\nVeo profile is plug shaped, but unlike in\nthe rectangular chamber, the field strength\nand therefore Veo vary with the thickness of\nthe chamber. However, by making the I;\npotential inversely proportional to E at\neach step, it should be possible to make\nVeo independent of x, leaving only a gradient in E.\nA crucial feature of the VGF and FGF\nmodifications is the adjustment of Veo.\nThis can be done by coating the walls\nwith a protein (or other suitable substance)\nthat has the desired I; potential under the\noperating conditions. However, a better\ntechnique would be to adjust the potential\nof the wall directly, as shown in Figure 1.\nThis work was done by Rizwan\nSharnez, Garland E.

The sensor\nmust be isolated from both the temperature and the fluctuations of pressure in\nthe test environment because it is sensitive\nnot only to oxygen content but also to\ntemperature and pressure effects in that\nenvironment.) This flow-system-and-sensor\narrangement can also be adapted to other\ngas-analysis instruments that must be isolated from pressure and temperature effects of test environments.\nA sample stream of gas is withdrawn\nfrom a low-pressure [typically, 2-psi (14kPa)] test environment by a metal bellows\nextraction pump and directed to a T-fitting, one end of which is open to the\natmosphere [14 psi (about 97 kPa) at the\nlocation of the wind tunnels]. the other\nend of which is connected to the inlet of\nthe second stage of the system through a\nO.035-in. (O.89-mm) orifice. The second\nstage includes a heating tube leading to\nthe oxygen sensor. The flow of gas through\nthe heating tube into the oxygen sensor is\nkept at a constant rate (typically 4 L/min)\nand is pulled through the second stage by\nuse of a sample pump and a flow controller. The heating tube heats the sample\n\nInlet\n\nSample Flow From\nLow-Pressure\nTest Environment\nTube 20 ft Long\n\nExtraction\nPump\n\nReference\nAir\n\nThis Two-Stage Flow System isolates an oxygen sensor from pressure and temperature effects\nin the atmosphere of the test environment.\n\nflow to a constant temperature, and the\nopen-ended T ensures a constant sample\npressure.

Velocity\nVectors in an\nInterrogation\nRegion are chosen from magnitude and angle\nhistograms constructed from the\ncentroid map of\nthe region .\n\ngraph by this technique, magnified video\nimages of the interrogation regions are\nfirst generated by use of a charge-coupled-device video camera equipped with\na zoom lens and a microscope objective.\nThe output of the video camera is sent to\na frame grabber, then to a computer for\nprocessing. During the acquisition of the\nmagnified video images, the photograph\nis illuminated by white light and mounted\non a translation stage, which is used to\nscan incrementally over the flow field (see\nFigure 2).\nThe image of each interrogation region is\nthresholded to reduce noise, then processed into a centroid map, which is essentially a simplified version of the image in\nwhich a single-pixel dot indicates the centroid of the image of each particle. The vector and histogram computations are then\nperformed, using the centroids as the locations of the particles.\nTo quantify the probability of detection of\nvalid vectors in this technique, a limited\nsimulation study has been performed. The\nresults of this study indicate that there are\nstrong correlations among the density of\nparticle images, the separations between\nthe double-exposure images of the particles, and the vector-detection rate. The\nresults suggest that to obtain a valid-vector-detection rate of 90 percent or more,\nthe number of image pairs per interrogation region must be maintained between 3\nand 7, with a separation of no more than\n20 percent of the size of the interrogation\nregion. Thus, the accuracy of the technique depends heavily on how wen the\ndensities and separations of image pairs\nare controlled during the analysis.\nIn a demonstration of the technique,\nPIV photographs taken in air of the flow\naround an airfoil were analyzed. By maintaining the density of image pairs in the\ninterrogation regions close to 5, a falsevector-detection rate of approximately 5\npercent was obtained. This is consistent\nwith the results of the simulation study.\nThis work was done by William M.\nHumphreys, Jr., of Langley Research\nCenter.

Older\nwater-reclamation apparatuses based on sorption and ion\nexchange are ineffective in eliminating such materials, which include\nakxlhoIs, aldehydes, ketones, amides, glycols, and thiocarbarnides. This\ncatalytic-oxidation apparatus reduces the total amount of organic\ncarbon in the effluent to less than 350 parts per billion (ppb) below the maximum allowable level of 500 ppb established by\nNASA for potable water in its life-support systems.\nThe apparatus (see figure) includes an oxygen saturator, in\nwhich oxygen passes through hollow, permeable fibers, into the\ninfluent stream, where it is dissolved (see figure). A regenerative heat\nexchanger preheats the oxygen-saturated influent. (The heat exchanger draws heat from the effluent, which is heated during\nthe catalytic oxidation step.)\nThe influent enters the catalytic reactor, where its organic contaminants are oxidized by physical and chemical processes at the\nsurface of the catalyst. For example, a primary alcohol like ethanol\nis adsorbed along with oxygen on the catalyst, and is then oxidized\nto the corresponding organic acid. This reaction is followed by a\nslower oxidation of the organic acid to form carbon dioxide and\nwater. Larger contaminant molecules pass through intermediate\nstages; for example, isopropanol is partially oxidized to form acetone, which in tum is oxidized to carbon dioxide. Of the catalysts\ntested in a prototype reactor, the most effective have consisted of\nplatinum and ruthenium on carbon supports.\nThe effluent from the catalytic reactor passes through the heat\nexchanger, where its heat is transferred to the influent. The concentrations of carbon dioxide and unused oxygen in the effluent\nfrom the catalytic reactor and heat exchanger depend on the initial\nconcentrations of oontaminants and dissolved oxygen. Mer the effluent has passed through the heat exchanger and transferred much of\nthe heat acquired in the reactor to the influent, oxygen and carbon\n\nSpecify Universal, and get air filters custom designed to:\n\xc2\xb7 Meet your specs precisely\n\xc2\xb7 Keep your product clean\n\xc2\xb7 Be easily maintained\n\xc2\xb7 Withstand serious abu e\n... air ftlters custom manufactured with a wide choice of\nmedia, to close tolerances, under strict quality control,\nby people who value their reputation.\nPhone or Fax now while you\'re thinking about it, for a free\nsample ftlter and technical data.

The spatial variations of phase delay in these holograms are quasi-continuous, as\ndistinguished from stepwise as in binary\nphase holograms made by integrated- circuit fabrication. These holograms are more\nprecise than are binary holograms. The\ngreater continuity and precision of these\nholograms should result in decreased\nscattering loss and increased imaging efficiency.\nIn preparation for fabrication of a hologram, a layer of PMMA of thickness corresponding to somewhat more than one\nwavelength of optical retardation relative to\nair is spun on an optical flat. The film then\nis exposed to a scanning electron beam\nthat is spatially modulated under computer control to generate the holographic pattern, in which a specified phase delay is\nencoded in each picture element. Next,\nthe pattern is partially chemically developed (analogously to development of a\nphotograph) to render the holographic\npattern in relief. Rapid development in a\nstrong developer (e.g., etching for 6 s in\nacetone) approximately linearizes the doseresponse characteristic of the film and\nthereby enhances the ability to obtain the\ndesired phase delay.\nThe figure shows a typical dose-response curve and indicates that the depth\nof etch can be controlled to within \xc2\xb120 nm,\nwhich corresponds to an optical phase\nshift of \xc2\xb1%o of a typical visible wavelength.\nThis curve is characterized by low contrast, which is needed for precise control\nof depth of etch .\nAlthough the local electron-beam dosage exerts the primary effect on the local\ndepth of etch , there is also a secondary\neffect (a proximity effect) of dosage at\n\n56\n\n1.8r-- - --\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDevelopment:\n6.0 Seconds in Acetone\n\nE\n\nI\n\n- - - - -- - - - -- - - - -- - - - ,\n\n:L\n\n1.2\n\na:\n\n~\n\n::IE\nD..\n\n\'0\n0.6\n\n3rd-Order Fit\nStandard Error =17 nm\n\nO.O_...::;;....._ _ _ _ _ _-\'-_ _ _ _ _ _--L.._ _ _ _ _ _ _...J\n\no\n\n60\nDose, IIC/cm 2\n\n120\n\n180\n\nThe Thickness of PMMA Removed and thus the phase delay varies continuously with the local\nelectron-beam dose.\n\nother pOints in the vicinity. The data in the\nfigure were obtained by exposing isolated\n50-~m-square patches, then measuring\nthe depth of etch at the center of each\npatch, where the proximity effect was uniform and therefore related only to local\ndosage.\nIn addition to the proximity effect, there\nis also a side-wall-etching effect caused\npartly by the isotropy of the etching process. A mathematical model of the sidewall-etching effect might be used to correct for it via further modification of the\nlocal electron-beam dose. In exposing a\ncomplicated phase hologram with picture\nelements that are about as large as (or\nsmaller than) the characteristic radius of\nthe proximity effect, it would be desirable\nto modify the local dosage to correct in\n\nadvance for the proximity and side-walletching effects.\nThis work was done by Paul D.

The improvements in\nmechanical and chemical properties are\nattributable to the semicrystaliinity that\nis introduced into the otherwise amorphous polymers by the incorporation of\nthe carbonyl and ether linkages.\nThe carbonyl and ether linkages are\nincorporated into a polyamideimide of the\nnew type via one of the novel diamines.\nThe diamine is reacted with trimellitic anhydride chloride (see figure). trimellitic\ntrichloride, trimeliitic anhydride, monomethyltrimellityl chloride, or trimellitic acid.\nThe resulting intermediate product - a\npolyamide acid - is then cyclodehydrated to the polyamideimide either chemically\nor by heating to a temperature above\n150\xc2\xb0C.\nThe best overall combination of properties was obtained by the synthesis of\ncopolymers of the polyamideimides. For\nexample, the copolyamideimide from the\nreaction of trimellitic anhydride chloride\nwith a 60:40 mole percent mixture of 1,3bis(4-aminophenoxy-4\'-benzoyl)benzene\nand 1 ,4-bis(4-aminophenoxy-4\' -benzoyl)benzene formed a tough, solvent\nresistant semicrystaliine film with a glasstransition temperature of 224\xc2\xb0C and a\ncrystalline melt transition at 347\xc2\xb0C.

The primary impetus for the use of polymer matrix materials is a net saving of weight for air and\nspace vehicles. The design of advanced\naircraft requires the saving of weight to\nincrease thrust-to-weight ratios for superior performance . Both performance\nand cost of advanced materials will provide\nthe impetus for the use of polymeric\nmatrix materials in future aircraft and\nspacecraft designs. Yet the performance\nof polymeric materials in advanced aircraft engines suffers in envirehments\nwhere temperatures rise above 300\xc2\xb0C\n(575\xc2\xb0F).\nTwo resins that have been developed\nat Lewis Research Center to replace meta\x01s in aircraft engines are PMR-15 and\nPMR-II -50. Where temperatures can\nreach 300\xc2\xb0C, PMR-15 is the resin of\nchoice. PMR-II-50, a higher-temperature\nthermoset polyimide, is being considered\nfor use in aircraft-engine components that\noperate at temperatures up to 371 \xc2\xb0C\n(700\xc2\xb0F). The end-cap compound used in\nPMR-15 and PMR-II-50 is nadic acidester. Nadic acid-ester contains many\naliphatic carbon atoms, which limit upper\nuse temperature in both PMR-15 and PMRII-50. Also, during polymerization , this end\ncap emits a gas (see Figure 1) that must\nbe entrained completely during the polymerization process, or voids occur in the\ncured resin.\nN-CYCAP (amiNe substituted CYClophane Addition Polyimide) is a thermoset\npolyimide developed at Lewis Research\nCenter. N-CYCAP contains 4-amino[2.2]paracyclophane as its end cap (see Figure\n2). Each of the pairs of aromatic rings of\nthe cyclophane end cap is held together\nby two two-carbon bridges: this imparts a\nlarge strain energy to the end cap. To\nrelieve the strain, the bond between one of\nthe two-carbon bridges in each pair of aromatic rings ruptures at 250\xc2\xb0C (480\xc2\xb0F) and\npolymerizes to form a highly aromatiC,\ncross-linked polyimide. No volatile gases\nare evolved during the polymerization\nprocess.\nPreviously, the synthesis of the 4-amino[2.2]paracyclophane end cap was a\nlong, low-yield process. Current improvements in the synthesis of the end cap\ninclude increasing the yield to 60 percent\noverall and decreasing the manufacturing time by simplifying the synthetiC procedure. This has enabled large-scale production and increased the viability of\ncyclophane end caps for polymers for\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1994\n\n~N~N~\n~I\'\n\'Y\'P\nPMR\n\no\n\n~~,Q."\'.\n\n-----t\n..\n\n\xc2\xa2N-ANV-\xc2\xa2\n\n(Gas)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nFigure 1.

A fault tree must have a\ntreelike structure; that is, neither cycles\nnor loops are allowed in such a graph.\nHowever, a digraph may contain any pattem of interconnection between nodes.\nA common operation performed on digraph and fault-tree models is the calculation of minimal cut sets. A cut set is a set\nof basic failures that could cause a given\n(target) failure event to occur. A minimal\ncut set for a target-event node in a fault\ntree or digraph is any cut set for the node,\nsuch that if anyone of the failures in the\nset is removed , the occurrence of the\nother failures in the set will not cause the\ntarget failure event.\n\nThe CLJrSEfS computer program identifies all the minimal cut sets for a given\nnode. The CUTSETS software package\ncontains subprograms that solve for minimal cut sets of fault trees and digraphs by\nuse of object-oriented programming techniques. These cut-set codes can be used\nto solve graph models for reliability analysis and identify potential single-point failures in a modeled system.\nThe fault-tree minimal-cut-set code reads\na fault-tree-model input file with each node\nlisted in a text format.

The\nmethods are based on approximate equations for the limiting stresses in a singlebolt joint in the five modes of failure that\noccur most commonly in practice (see\nfigure) .\nThe first is the local -bearing-failure\nmode, in which a plate fails locally in compression, crushed at the contact with the\nNASA Tech Briefs.

To design preliminarily against failure\nin this mode, one chooses these parameters so that F/dtc is less than the compressive stress of the composite.\nIn the second mode of failure, called\n"net tension," the applied tensile force is\ndeemed to be distributed evenly over a\ncross-sectional plane that includes the axis\nof the bolthole. The tensile stress in this\nplane is apprOximated as F/(w - dltc\' where\n\nw is the width of the plate. In designing\npreliminarily against failure in this mode,\none chooses the parameters to make this\nstress less than the tensile strength of the\ncomposite material.\nIn the third mode of failure, called\n"wedge-type splitting ," a crack opens at\nthe local bearing point and propagates\nalong the plate to a free edge. Failure in\nthis mode is caused by the lateral pressure of the bolt against the bolthole, and\noccurs when the transverse splitting stress\nexceeds the transverse tensile strength .\nThe transverse splitting stress is approxi63\n\nIf you \' re looking for a Loran receiver that performs like a\nchamp, check out just a few of\nthe features that make our NEW\nModel 2104 loran Receiver the\ntop contender:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMinimizes impact of\nindividual transmitter failures\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLow cost\nField upgradeable to include\nCPS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nQuick acquisition of Loran\nstations\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUnknown Position Locator\ndetermines best CRI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProvides optimal control of\ninternal disciplined crystal\noscillator\n\nMetal or\nComposite\nPlate\n\nOnly frequency receiver to\ntrack multiple Loran stations\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNut\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUS NO and NIST traceable\ncalibration source\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNew technique for quick\nexternal frequency\nmeasurements\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSelectable report generation\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSupports up to 2,000\' antenna\ncable\n\nThe Model 2104 comes standard with disciplined crystal\noscillator, I/O interface (RS-232\nor IEEE-488), input module (1,5\nor 10 MHz), output module (.1,\n1, 5, or 10 MHz), passive whip\nantenna and cable.

The\nshear stress that causes this failure is\napproximated as F/2etc\' and one chooses preliminary design parameters to make\nthis stress less than the shear strength\nof the plate material.\nIn the fifth mode of failure, called \'\'tension\nwith shear-aut ," a chunk on one side\nbreaks off in both tension on a crosssectional plane and shear on a longitudinal\nplane. The load that causes failure in this\nmode is approximated by the equation\ntc[(w - d)SCXXT + 2e Scxysl\n\nF=--------------2\nwhere S cxxT is the tensile strength and\nScxys is the in-plane shear strength of the\nplate material.\nWhile a multiple-bolt joint can be analyzed and designed by use of the same\nequations, one must be careful to allocate the loads correctly among the various\nbolts. In the traditional first approximation,\none assumes that all bolts share the load\n\nequally. In a more realistic approximation,\nthe bolts in the first row carry most of the\nload. In a yet more realistic approximation in\na partial worst-case analysis, one might\nconsider the effects of redistribution of loads\nto remaining bolts after a failure in one of\nthe five modes at a specified bolt. The\nanalysis can be made still more accurate\nby considering such factors as the transfer of loads through friction , effects of cydic\nloading and unloading, effects of heat and\nmoisture , effects of biaxial loading ,\nthrough - the-thickness compression\ncaused by tightening of bolts, and f1atwise local bearing stresses at the edges of\nbolts, nuts, and washers.\n\nThis work was done by Christos C.\nChamis of Lewis Research Center.\nFurther informauon may be found in NASA\nTM-100281 {N88 - 15020}, "Simplified\nProcedures for Designing Composite\nBolted Joints.

The thermostatic valves\nwould all be set to the same opening!closing temperature, so that\nthey would regulate the flows in all the passages to equalize or\nnearly equalize the temperature across the panel in the presence\nof transient, nonuniform surface heating. This simple concept of\nthe combined regulation of flow and temperature could be especially beneficial in an application in which (1) overheating could\ncause damage and (2) both overcooling and excessive circulation\nof coolant could occur in the absence of regulation if the cooling\ncapacity of the panel were made large enough to handle the peak\nheat load. Potential applications include cooled structures for\nadvanced hypersonic aircraft and engines.\nTypically, a cooled panel would contain multiple parallel passages. The upper part of the figure shows one such passage of\nrectangular cross section, in which a simple thermostatic valve in\nthe form of a shape-memory-alloy flap would be incorporated in\nthe downstream end or another suitable temperature-sensing\nlocation. The opening/closing temperature of this valve would\nbe the critical transition temperature of the shape-memory alloy:\nabove this temperature, the alloy is relatively strong and stiff;\nbelow this temperature, the alloy is relatively weak and flexible. A\nflap made of this alloy can exert considerable force when it is heated from below to above this temperature and it attempts to\nretum to its original shape.\nAbove the critical transition temperature, the flap would straighten itself out into the open configuration and would be deflected\nonly slightly by the pressure of the flowing coolant. If the temperature in the passage were to fall below the critical transition temperature, the alloy would become flexible, so that the flap would\nbe bent toward the closed configuration by the pressure of the\nflowing coolant. Thus, the flap would ease or restrict the flow of\ncoolant, respectively, depending on whether the temperature\nwas above or below the critical transition temperature.

A 7-DOF manipulator has one\nredundant DOF because six DOF\'s suffice\nto specify the position and orientation of\nits end effector. The class of 7-DOF manipulators with revolute joints is important\nbecause it includes manipulators that have\nshoulder, elbow, and wrist joints like those\nof the human arm (see figure).\nThe present development based on the\narm angle is an intermediate product of a\ncontinuing effort to exploit the redundancy in\na manipulator according to the concept of\nbasic and additional tasks. The concept\ncan be summarized in somewhat oversimplified form as (1) using the non redundant\ndegrees of freedom to perform the basic\ntask of positioning and orienting the end\neffector as specified and (2) using the\nredundant degrees of freedom to perform a\nsimultaneous additional task; e.9:... reaching\naround an obstacle or maintaining a desired\nposture while positioning the end effector.\nThis concept was also discussed in\n"Configuration-Control Scheme Copes With\nSingularities" (NPO-18556), NASA Tech\nBriefs, Vol. 17, No.2 (February 1993), page\n81, and "Increasing the Dexterity of\nRedundant Robots" (NPO-17801), NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 14, No. 10 (October 1990),\npage 88.\nThe arm angle can be defined as the\nangle between (1) the plane that contains the\nshoulder, elbow, and wrist jOints and (2) a\nreference plane that includes the line from\nthe shoulder joint to the wrist joint. The arm\nangle can be described equivalently as an\nangle of motion of the elbow about a line\nfrom the shoulder to the wrist. Of oourse, the\narm angle is undefined when the arm is\nheld out straight or folded to a configuration\n66\n\nin which the wrist and shoulder joints line up.\nThe forward kinematic mappings from\nthe manipulator-joint angles to the Cartesian\ncoordinates of all of the components of the\nmanipulator. In the arm-angle representation, the forward kinematic mappings\nbecome, more specifically, the mappings\nfrom the manipulator-joint angles to the\ncoordinates of the end effector and to the\narm angle. The differential kinematic mapping maps joint velocities to end-effector\nand arm angle velocities. The practical significance of the arm-angle representation is\nthat the efficiency of the resulting algorithms\ncan accelerate the kinematical computations - an advantage in the case of a typical redundant manipulator, for which it is\nnecessary to update the kinematic map-\n\npings at a rate between 40 and 200 Hz for\ncontrol. This development also has more\ngeneral significance in that similar enhancements of the efficiency of computation of\nthe forward and inverse kinematics of any 7DOF robotic manipulator can be obtained\nby use of any appropriate redundancyresolving scalar parameter, which does not\nnecessarily have to be the arm angle.\nThis work was done by Homayoun Seraji and Mark K.

Slots on the side\nof the grip body accommodate inlet and\noutlet oonnections for cooling water. Threads\non the bottom of the grip body mate with\nthe hydraulic-actuator housing.\nThe bottom of the actuator housing of\none of the two grips is attached to the\nstationary head of the test machine. The\nother grip is similarly fastened to the loading\nram of the test machine.\nA technician loads a specimen by slipping each end between a pair of wedges in\neach wedge housing. A bracket atop the\ngrip body aligns the specimen with the\ncenterline of the machine. The technician\nthen uses the hydraulic control system to\nadvance the piston extension shafts; the\nshafts push the wedges along the sloped\ninternal surfaces of the wedge housing,\nthereby clamping the specimen. The\nhydraulic pressure is regulated to obtain\nthe required clamping force. Figure 2\nshows a complete setup with a specimen\ninstalled in a pair of grips.\nThe grips are dimensioned so that they\ncan transfer loads of up to 5,000 Ib (22\nkN) while fitting in a furnace 22 in. (56\ncm) long. The grips are made of a nickel\nalloy that retains its strength at the maximum operating temperature.\nThese hydraulic grips offer important\nadvantages over older devices for gripping\nspecimens in high-temperature tests. Unlike\nin the case of pin-loading grips, there is no\nneed to drill holes in specimens, with attendant stress concentrations that may distort\ntest results. Unlike bolted-clamp grips,\nthese grips maintain a constant gripping\nforce on specimens, unaffected by thermal expansion. Rnally, unlike conventional\nhydraulic grips, these can be heated to the\nsame temperature as that of the specimen, without risk of heating the hydraulic\nfluid and actuator components.\nThis work was done by R.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA filter removes foam from the soapy\nwater stream discharged by the primary\nphase separator of a water-reclamation\nsystem. The filter uses no antifoam chemicals, which would not only have to be\nreplenished but would also place an\nadded load on a water-reclamation system. The filter contains no moving parts\nand requires no energy input other than\n\n68\n\nthe small energy needed to pump the\nwater through the filter.\nThe mixture of air and water from the\nprimary unit flows into, along, and radially\nthrough the core of the filter (see figure). A\nporous membrane surrounds the core.\nBecause the membrane is wet, water\nflows through it much more readily than air\ndoes. (This phase selectivity of a wet\n\nmembrane is used in the "bubble point"\ntest for the integrity of a filter medium.\nThe wet medium is pressurized with air; a\ngood filter contains the air up to a pressure that decreases with increasing size of\nits pores.)\nThe water and air that do not enter the\nmembrane flow axially out the core and\nare retumed to the primary separator.

Heretofore,\nreleasable linear actuators have typically\nbeen relatively large solenoidal electromagnets, which have low mechanical advantages and which consume high powers\nduring engagement. The proposed actuator would require low power to maintain\nrelease and no power to maintain engagement.\nPins on a yoke on one end of the ball\nscrew would be spring-loaded into engagement with a slot on the piston and\nwould be withdrawn from engagement by\nturning-on small solenoidal electromagnets. During disengagement, an optical\nsensor on the yoke would detect optical\ntargets on the piston, and the output of\nthis sensor would be used in a feedback\ncontrol system that would drive the ball\nscrew in such a way as to make the yoke\ntrack the movement of the disengaged\npiston as though it were engaged.\nWhen it was time to restrict the free\nmovement of the piston and constrain it to\nmove according to the ball-screw-drive\ncommand, the solenoids would be deactivated, allowing the springs to push the\npins into engagement in the slot on the piston. Spring loading of the pins would also\nserve as a fail-safe feature in that it would\nmaintain engagement when electrical\npower was lost.\nThis work was done by Gordon H.\nYoung of Rockwell International Corp. for\nLewis Research Center.

This electromechanical actuator is\ncleaner (because there is nothing to leak)\nand simpler, and needs less maintenance.\nOther electromechanical actuators of\nsimilar size and design are available. This\nelectromechanical actuator includes a rotary-to-linear-motion converter. Two brushless dc motors drive a threaded rollerscrew shaft via a gear train; a piston\nattached to a shaft nut travels along the\nthreaded shaft when the shaft is rotated.\nThe two principal innovative features that\ndistinguish the new actuator from prior\nelectromechanical actuators of this type\nare (1) the use of a shaft -angle resolver\n(instead of a linear variable-differential\ntransformer) as a source of position feedback to an electronic control subsystem\nand (2) an anti backlash gearing arrangement.\nThe actuator (see figure) is attached,\nwith spherical bearings at its ends, to the\ntwo objects that are to be moved incrementally with respect to each other. Increments of linear motion are monitored\nand controlled via the increments of angular motion measured by the shaft-angle\nresolvers and the known relationship (from\ngear ratios and thread pitch) between rotation and translation. The anti backlash gearing arrangement, which helps to maintain\nprecision of the increments, is implemented in a special fabrication sequence that\nincludes precise machining and small\nadjustments.\nThe idler gears, which are parts of the\nanti backlash gearing, also reduce the\nspeed of rotation of the shaft and increase\nthe torque applied to the output gear. The\noutput gear is keyed to the threaded shaft.\nThe shaft is supported by a quadruplex\nset of angular-contact ball bearings. Seals\nprevent the entry of contaminants into the\nbearings. A linear bearing impregnated\nwith graphite keeps the piston aligned with\nthe axis of linear motion.\nThis work was done by John R. Cowan\nand William N. Myers of Marshall Space\nFlight Center.

It was\ndecided to interpret brain waves via those\nmovements of the eyes that are associated with tasks: the eyes indicate cognitive processes, and the tasks provide a\ncontext.\nAt the heart of the testbed is a computer that records positions of the eyes\nand head, the activity of the brain, and\nkeystroke responses and that controls\nall aspects of experimental tasks. The\ndata on brain waves are collected by a\ncommercial electroencephalograph . An\noculometer mounted on a helmet (see\nFigure 2) collects the data on the movements of the eyes. A magnetic head\ntracker measures the location and orientation of the head.\nThe computer uses a specialized algorithm to process eye-movement data\nfrom the oculometer and the spatial information from the magnetic head tracker to obtain the location of the eye with\nrespect to the magnetic source of the\nhead tracker. The algorithm also calculates a three-dimensional vector, the origin\nof which is at the location of the eye.\nThis represents the line of gaze of the\neye. This vector is extrapolated to a point\nof intersection - called the su bject\'s\npoint of gaze - with the graphical display\nof the computer.\nAnother point-of-gaze algorithm enables the experimenter to determine\nwhere the subject was looking at any\ntime during the experiment. Sy processing a window of data on the positions and orientations of the head and\neyes, it is possible to study the behavior\nof the eyes during a specified interval.\nThe eye-analysis software module that\ncontains this point-of-gaze algorithm also\ncontains software filters that remove data\non blinks and saccadic (twitching) movements. These functions are necessary to\ntransform the raw eye-movement information into a form in which it can be\nreadily correlated with brain-wave information in a task context.\nTo calibrate the oculometer, the subject\nis instructed to look at nine predefined\npoints on the graphical display, and the\noculometer records eye-position data during one-half second for each point (30\nrecords per point). From these nine\npoints, the oculometer can extrapolate\nany location on the screen. The accuracy\nof calibration has typically been between\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1994\n\nRyan, and James M.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA proposed fastener would include\nmetal loops and hooks that could be repeatedly put together and pulled apart\nlike the familiar Velcro (or equivalent)\nplastic fastener. Until now, there has\nbeen a fundamental obstacle to making\nmetal analogs of plastic hook-and-Ioop\nfasteners: metals can tolerate far less\nelastic unit strain than plastics can (1\npercent for metals versus 5 percent for\nplastics). As a metal loop of conventional\n\ndesign is pulled away from a hook, the\nhook is greatly deformed, briefly, until the\nloop escapes . The resulting strain is\nenough to deform permanently or even\nbreak a metal hook the first time a fastener is disengaged.\nThe design of the proposed fastener\nwould prevent this permanent deformation\nor breakage by using hooks with rigid tips\nand flexible stems that both bend and\ntwist as loops are pulled away (see figure).\n\nThe bending and twisting would take\nplace at the maximum distance from the\nend of each hook so that stress for a\ngiven deflection would be minimized.\nThis work was done by Bernard Sawar,\nJ. P. Ross, and Andrew C. Harvey of\nFoster-Miller, Inc., for Johnson Space\nCenter.

Many such strips\nwould be arrayed in parallel to form the hook half of the fastener. Each hook would twist and bend as its loop was pulled away.\n\nFatigue-Resistant Metal Hook-and-Loop Fastener\nTorsion and bending would be largely eliminated.\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA proposed metal hook-and-Ioop\nfastener could be engaged and dis engaged many hundreds of times without breaking. The fastener would have a\nlifetime much greater than that of other\nmetal hook-and-Ioop fasteners, which\ndepend on flexure for disengagement\n[for example, see the preceding article,\n"Hook-and-Loop Metal Fastener" (MSC21586)]. The proposed fastener could\nwithstand many hundreds of openingand-closing cycles, whereas a fastener\nof the type described in the preceding\n\n74\n\narticle is expected to be limited to\nfewer than 100 cycles.\nThe fastener would open by mechanical action - any of several forms\nof translation (see figure) . The translation\nwould move hooks out of loops or push\nloops away from hooks. The hooks\nwould not be required to flex and , therefore, would not fail by fatigue.\nThe figure shows three alternative\nproposed schemes for locking and\nunlocking translation . In scheme A,\nhooks would be spaced so that they\n\nwould trap loops in the "closed" position . Before actuation, the tip of each\nhook would be shielded by the tip of the\nhook facing it. This kind of locking is\nuseful when a part has to be positioned\nand adjusted several times before it is\nfinally engaged. Somewhat simpler is\nscheme B, in which parallel rows of\nhooks would be pushed together to\nengage hooks. In scheme C, one of an\nadjacent pair of strips might consist of\nhooks, and the other might consist of\nposts. In this case, the movement of the\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1994\n\nposts past the hooks would push the loops off the hooks.\nA further advantage of the new concept is that little effort\nwould be needed to disengage a fastener. In flexing metal\nhook-and-Ioop fasteners, the separation force must exceed\nthe rated maximum load and can be as much as 100 Ib/in. 2\n(690 kPa). In the nonflexing version, the major disengagement force would be the minimal one involved in translating\nthe hooks. The maximum load can be quite high, well over\n100Ib/in. 2 .\nThis work was done by Bernard Sawaf of Foster-Miller,\nInc., for Johnson Space Center.

In the case\nof a dispersion-strengthened aluminous\nalloy, this involves a pressure generally\nless than 15 kpsi (about 100 MPa) and a\ntemperature in the range of 600 to 950 OF\n(about 316 to 510 0G). Densification in a\ndouble-acting press is usually variable,\nbeing maximum at the ram faces and\nless in the center. By using the wrought\nband and an appropriate temperature, a\ncompact of 100-percent density at the\nend faces can be obtained, and an airtight bond can be achieved between the\npowder and the wrought peripheral band.\nThe band does not become corrugated\nduring consolidation, as happens to the\nside wall of a can when a canned billet is\nconsolidated.\nThe peripheral band is also essential\nin the next fabrication steps - forging\nand rolling. Inasmuch as the billet is substantially densified, it is suitable for effective induction heating and can be handled in air as long as it does not crack\nand expose a porous interior. Thus, the\nbillet can be heated in minutes to the\ntemperature necessary to press its major surfaces for sufficient reduction to produce a rollable ingot.\nThe band acts to constrain the outer\nfibers of the powder billet, reducing the\npotential for cracking. The band is also\nretained during rolling, in which its ductile nature reduces the tendency for the\npowder alloy article to crack at the edge\nor split. The band is finally removed in normal edge, head, and tail trim .\nOne disadvantage of the technique is\nthat it creates mixed alloy scrap. Potential\nuse would be in the production of plates\nand sheets and perhaps other objects\nfrom "hard" powders, particularly from\npowders, the objects made from which\nhave a propensity to crack when mechanically worked to other forms.\nThis work was done by James R.\nThomas of Langley Research Center\nand Ogle R.

The codes in question must have\nthe same Nand K parameters (defined\nbelow) but can otherwise be two distinct\nRS codes . The mapping was intended\noriginally to enable the same ground based decoder to decode telemetry signals from two spacecraft in two different\nRS codes of (N, K) = (255 , 223) . The\nmapping could also be useful in purely\nterrestrial data communications and in\noptical and magnetic recording and playback of digitized audio and video signals.\nIn particular, the mapping could be implemented in interface circuitry and/ or software to enable communication between\ncoding systems of different manufacturers\nthat use different RS codes within the\nsame (N, K) family.\nRS codes contain redundant data that\ncan be used to correct errors. An RS code\nis characterized over a finite or Galois field,\nGF(~) , where J is the number of bits in a\nsymbol. An RS code word is N = ~-1\nsymbols long; K of these symbols represent the information to be conveyed,\nwhile the remaining N - K symbols are\ncheck symbols, which are redundant in\nthat they are computed over distinct subsets of the information symbols. The check\nsymbols provide the capability to correct\nerrors in E = (N - K)/2 symbols. The elements of GF(2J) for a given RS code are\ndefined by a Jth degree primitive fieldgenerator polynomial over GF(2), and the\ncode over the particular GF(2J) is characterized by another polynomial of\ndegree 2E known as the code-generator polynomial.\n\nTECH BRIEFS INDEXES\nNASA publishes annual and\ncumulative NASA Tech Brief\nindexes in hard copy format\nat a very reasonable cost.\n\nConsider two RS codes - code 1 and\ncode 2 of the same (N, K)\n[equivalently, of the same (J , E)l .\nSuppose that the decoder is designed for\ncode 1, and it is desired to decode\nreceived words that are in code 2 and\nthat may contain erroneous symbols. The\nmapping involves, first , a succession of\nlinear transformations that convert each\nreceived word in code 2 to an equivalent\nword in code 1. The transformations are\nderived from the field- and code-generator polynomials. The transformations are\nperformed before decoding, and they do\nnot change the number of erroneous\nsymbols. After decoding, including correction of errors, the inverses of the\n\ntransformations are applied in reverse\nsequence to correct the received word .\nThe transformations and their inverses can\nbe incorporated into the decoder via hardware or software.\nThis work was done by Marvin\nPeriman of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Typically, a hole is drilled\ninto the skull and a catheter with a pressure-sensing device is inserted into the\nbrain to monitor the ICP. To determine\nthe PVI, saline solution is inserted into the\ncerebrospinal fluid system while the\nchange in ICP is monitored.\nThe disadvantage of these techniques\nis that an open wound must be maintained. Because antibiotics are only partially effective in treating cranial infections, the ICP sensor can be left in situ\nfor only 2 weeks or less. After that time,\nthe sensor must be removed to close\nthe wound. Consequently, the physician\nmust try to guess the interval during the\npatient\'s treatment when the knowledge\nof ICP and of the PVI is most needed.\nTo overcome these disadvantages, a\ntechnique has been proposed at NASA\nLangley Research Center to measure ICP\nand the PVI by noninvasive techniques.\nThe peak pressure in the cerebrospinal\nfluid can be determined by use of the\nintracranial dynamics (ICD) instrument (see\nfigure) to determine the sensitivity of the\nskull to changes in pressure and by use\nof a mechanical device to exert an\nextemal calibrated pressure on the skull.\nBy monitoring the volume of blood flowing into the jugular vein, one can determine the change of the volume of blood\nin the cranial system. By measuring the\nresponse of the skull to increasing pressure (where pressure is increased by tilting the patient a known amount) and by\nusing cranial blood pressure, one can\ndetermine the initial pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid. Hence, the PVI can be\ndetermined by noninvasive means. Once\nthe PVI has been determined, the ICP\ncan be determined.\nThe ICP instrument has been built and\ntested. The instrument works by sending\nultrasound through the cranium and monitoring the ultrasound signal after its traversal. The determinations are based on\nan equation of state for the cerebrospinal\n78\n\n---\n\nTransducer\n\nr-------+--?------.-~ --\n\nSampled-PhaseSignal Output\n\nReceived-Signal Output\n\nSumming\n\nCircuit\n\nPhase-Signal\nOutput\n\nFrequency-Setting\nClrcuij\n\nAnalog (Main)-Signal\nOutput\n\nThe Intracranial Dynamics Instrument probes the cranium ultrasonically to obtain data for\nthe determination of the intracranial pressure and the pressure-volume index.\n\nsystem. By determining the appropriate\nvalues in the equation of state, measured\nacoustical parameters and their evolution in time can be used to determine\nthe significant physiological parameters.\nThe voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)\nis set close to the resonant frequency of\nthe transducer by the frequency-setting\ncontrol. The logic and timing circuits send\nout a gate signal, the width of which is preset. The mixer forms a tone burst, which is\nsent to the transducer. The transducer\nsends an ultrasonic tone burst through\nthe skull. This is reflected from the opposite side and is received by the same\ntransducer.\nThe received signal is amplified, and its\nphase is compared by a mixer, the output voltage of which is proportional to the\ndeviation of the received signal from quadrature with the signal of the VCO. This voltage is sampled, held, and integrated. The\noutput of the integrator is fed through a\nsumming circuit to the VCO. The frequen-\n\ncy of the VCO is changed until quadrature between the output of the VCO and\nreceived signal is achieved. The frequency is recorded, and the process repeated. This repetition takes place at intervals of approximately 500 microseconds.\nAs the parameters change within the cranial cavity, the phase of the signal changes,\nforcing the frequency of the VCO to\nchange. The outputs are monitored to\nrecord the changes. From the values\nrecorded, the ICP and the PVI can be\ndetermined by calibration of the cranial\nsystem to known changes in pressure.\nThis work was done by John H. Cantrell\nand William T.
