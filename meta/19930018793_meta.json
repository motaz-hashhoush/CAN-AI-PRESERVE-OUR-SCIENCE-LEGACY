They form a synergistic system when properly used in concert with human activities. This paper discusses the various areas where robotics and automation may be used to enhance lunar base operations. Robots are particularly well suited for surface operations (exterior to the base habitat modules) because they can be designed to operate in the extreme temperatures and vacuum conditions of the Moon (or Mars). In this environment, the capabilities of semi-autonomous robots would surpass that of humans in all but the most complex tasks. Robotic surface operations include such activities as long range geological and mineralogical surveys with sample return, materials movement in and around the base, construction of radiation barriers around habitats, transfer of materials over large distances, and construction of outposts. Most of the above operations could be performed with minor modifications to a single basic robotic rover. Within the lunar base habitats there are a few areas where robotic operations would be preferable to human operations. Such areas include routine inspections for leakage in the habitat and its systems, underground transfer of materials between habitats, and replacement of consumables. In these and many other activities, robotic systems will greatly enhance lunar base operations. The robotic systems described in this paper are based on what is realistically achievable with relatively near term technology. A lunar base can be built and maintained if we are willing.", "title": "The use of automation and robotic systems to establish and maintain lunar base operations", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:09:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930018793, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Petrosky, Lyman J."}, "organization": {"name": "Westinghouse Electric Corp.", "location": "Madison, PA, United States"}}, "id": "1223f6bfc9ef478c9c24f076d649a5c7"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930018793, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930018793, "id": "e381060df51149b9b99096ac5d501c1f", "publicationName": "Arizona Univ., Proceedings of the Lunar Materials Technology Symposium", "publicationDate": "1992-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930018767, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Proceedings of the Lunar Materials Technology Symposium", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930018793.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930018793/downloads/19930018793.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930018793/downloads/19930018793.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930018793/downloads/19930018793.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
