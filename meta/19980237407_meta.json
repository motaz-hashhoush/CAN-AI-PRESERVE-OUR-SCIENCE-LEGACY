Each experiment in the overall package is designed to exercise a different technology objective that may be found in the overall satellite communications and telemetry system design. The data communications through TORSS portion is designed to demonstrate that low-power communications systems with non-gimbaled antenna systems can transport significant quantities of data through TDRSS to the ground based on only transmitting through a TDRS when the experiment is near the TDRS subsatellite point. The remaining time. the payload communications system is not active. The demand access experiment is to demonstrate that the request for a demand access service can be transmitted through TDRS and received and decoded at the ground station. In this mode, the TDRS does not track the experiment but signal processing components at the White Sands Complex are used to detect and track the transmitted request. The laser communications experiment is designed to demonstrate passive transmission of telemetry data from the experiment. This mode uses a ground-based laser source to illuminate the experiment and modulate the beam with the data. Ground-based reception recovers the data from the reflected beam back to the ground station.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980237407, "id": "b533aa1f59ad49039480407f5bf6873c", "publicationDate": "1998-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980237407.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980237407/downloads/19980237407.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980237407/downloads/19980237407.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980237407/downloads/19980237407.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
