These are; (1) the aspect sensitivity of the scattered signal and that this aspect sensitivity is largest in the lower part of the mesosphere, and (2) the correlating between the scattered power and the signal correlation time. This behavior is similar to that of the scattering from the troposphere/stratosphere region, and it is suggested that the scattering mechanisms are similar in these three regions. Several different experiments are performed. They all show strong indications of aspect sensitivity and changing correlation between scattered power and correlation time. There is no indication of stratified reflecting layers unless these layers are modulated in space and time to a degree that they cannot be distinguished from turbulence in any other way than that they cause somewhat aspect sensitive scattering.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840019032, "id": "bb082c7bb7154b02a42449fa6f5b566a", "publicationName": "International Council of Scientific Unions  Middle Atmosphere Program, Vol. 9", "publicationDate": "1983-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19840019032.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19840019032/downloads/19840019032.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19840019032/downloads/19840019032.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19840019032/downloads/19840019032.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
