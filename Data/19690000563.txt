The literature search produced considerable data on steadystate supersonic flow around protuberances, little\ndata on transient state supersonic flow, and no data\nat all on transonic flow. Thus, in the velocity region\nin which a vehicle experiences maximum dynamic\npressure and aerodynamic loading, the designer had\nno data on which to predict steady or fluctuating\nloads in the vicinity of a protuberance.\nAs an initial attempt to remedy this deficiency, a\nsmall-scale test program was conducted using a 14\nby 14-in. transonic wind tunnel to investigate the\nflow around generalized (cylindrical) projections, and\nalso around several specific configurations used on\nthe Saturn V launch vehicle. At best, these tests\nrevealed only qualitative information, since the small\nsize of the model limited the amount of instrumentation and the measurement accuracy. The data from\nthese tests are currently being analyzed.\nThe experimental design for a large-scale test to\nobtain more detailed data is the primary subject of\nthis report. A 16-ft square transonic wind tunnel\nwill be used to test both generalized and specialshaped protuberances.\nThe second section of the report presents a theoretical discussion of the experiment, the construction\nof the experimental apparatus, and the instrumentation design.\n\nThe third section outlines the computing facilities\nand the various programs needed for data reduction\nand analysis.\nThe final section gives many references to direct\nthe interested reader to more detailed information on\nthe background and prior experimentation.\n\nNotes:\n1. This report may be useful to persons involved in\naerodynamics research. Also, although no specific\nresults or engineering criteria are given, it may\ninterest those who are engaged in aerodynamic\ndesign in the transonic region.\n2.
