In another embodiment (not shown), solid (i.e.,\nslideably mounted on the two longitudinal flanges.\nFIG. 11 is a partial side view of an embodiment of an 6s solid to the core) elongated tracks are used.\nWith continued reference to FIG. 1, a hinge 3 provides\napparatus illustrating a carrier slideably mounted on longitudinal flanges.\none first means for connecting the elongated tracks in a\n\nPORTABLE CATAPULT LAUNCHER FOR\nSMALL AIRCRAFT\n\nUS 6,851,647 B1\n\n3\n\n4\n\ncontiguous and longitudinal manner as well as arranging the\ntrack system 4 from a fully extended configuration to a fully\nretracted configuration. Other first means for connecting the\nelongated tracks as described above include telescopically\nsliding overlapping elongated tracks from the fully retracted\nto fully extended configuration and vice versa; temporarily\njoining two elongated tracks by the use of bolts, nuts, pins\nor any combination; and temporarily joining two elongated\ntracks by the use of spherical bearings and molded indentures (not shown). Connection of the elongated tracks results\nin a continuous track system 4. In the embodiment illustrated\nin FIG. 1, the hinge 3 may be centered across the border of\nthe two elongated tracks and installed on both of the tracks,\nthus providing a means to fold the tracks. FIG. 3 illustrates\nthe track system 4 in its folded configuration. By folding the\nelongated tracks outward (i.e., the fully extended\nconfiguration), the elongated tracks are connected end-toend in a longitudinal manner such that the resultant track\nsystem 4 has four contiguous longitudinal sides. In this\nembodiment, two elongated tracks are utilized. However, for\neach additional elongated track greater than two, an additional first means for connecting the elongated tracks (e.g.,\nan additional hinge) may be added (not shown).\nWith reference to FIG. 14, a lever 47 and locking pin 48\nlock provides one means for interlocking two contiguous\nelongated tracks. In one embodiment, the lock comprises a\nlever 47 and locking pin 48 wherein the lever 47 may be\nattached to one of the respective contiguous elongated tracks\nand the locking pin 48 may be connected to the second\ncontiguous elongated track. In the fully extended configuration of this embodiment, the lever 47 may be placed over\nthe locking pin 48 and subsequently pressed down such that\nthe lever 47 captures the locking pin 48 in a lever groove or\nlever hole, thus interlocking the contiguous elongated tracks.\nAs illustrated in FIGS. 16 and 17, in another embodiment,\na means for interlocking two contiguous elongated tracks\nmay be comprised of a locking plate 49 of rigid material\nslidably connected to one of the respective contiguous\nelongated tracks and to the other respective contiguous\nelongated track in the fully extended configuration. In this\nparticular embodiment, the locking plate 49 is slideably\nconnected by use of locking plate grooves 51, which are\nincorporated into the connecting elongated tracks at predetermined locations. The locking plate 49 is designed to\ncorrespond to the design of the locking plate grooves 51\nsuch that a slideable connection can be made. In this\nembodiment, the locking plate 49 of rigid material may be\nconnected to the track system 4 by a security bungee cord 50\nto prevent losing the locking plate 49 when it is not used as\na lock. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, two elongated tracks are utilized. However, for each additional\nelongated track greater than two, an additional means for\ninterlocking two contiguous elongated tracks (e.& an additional lock as described above) may be added (not shown).\nWith continued reference to FIG. 1 and reference to FIG.\n6, a carrier 5 is slidably mounted to the track system 4. With\nreference to FIGS. 10 and 11, a flange-based carrier 41 is\nslideably mounted to a track system. In an embodiment, the\ngrooves 15 or flanges 40, as discussed above, are the primary\nmeans to slidably mount a carrier on the track system 4.\nFurther, the grooves 15 or flanges 40 also serve as guide rails\nto ensure a proper trajectory for a carrier during the launch\nphase. With continuing reference to FIG. 1, a secondary\nmeans to slidably mount the carrier 5 on the track system 4\nmay include the use of a multiplicity of bearings engaging\nthe carrier 5 and track system 5 . As illustrated in FIG. 6, in\none embodiment, roller bearings 12 may engage both the\ncarrier 5 and track system 4 thereby reducing the amount of\nfriction during the launch phase. In another embodiment,\nfriction during the launch phase may be further reduced by\nusing a dry style lubricant 52 as illustrated in FIG. 12. In a\n\nthird embodiment, the primary and secondary means discussed above are both employed. In a fourth embodiment,\nthe individual use of the primary or secondary means for\nslidably mounting the carrier 5 to the track system 5 is\nutilized. Further, in an embodiment, two (2) roller bearings\ninstalled on each longitudinal side of the carrier (four (4)\ntotal roller bearings 12) may be used as illustrated in FIG. 6.\nIn additional embodiments, a multiplicity of roller bearings\nmay be used. As illustrated in FIG. 6, in an embodiment, the\ncarrier 5 may be generally elongated in shape and may\ninclude a cross-sectional design having a generally rectangular shape. In this embodiment, the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s cross-sectional\ndesign forms a cavity as part of the carrier structure. In\nanother embodiment, a carrier cross-sectional design that\nresults in a carrier that is solid to the core is used (not\nshown). The shape of the carrier may be a function of the\nshape of the elongated tracks. Therefore multiple embodiments consisting of multiple shapes and sizes for the carrier\nexist. As an example, FIG. 5A illustrates a generally triangular shape for a carrier 30. As an example, FIG. 5B\nillustrates a generally elliptical or more specifically, circular,\nshape for a carrier 31.\nWith continued reference to FIG. 1, and reference to FIG.\n6, FIG. 12, FIG. 13, FIG. 18, and FIG. 20, in an embodiment,\nan adapter 6 may be temporarily connected to the carrier and\nprovides a means to temporarily attach an aircraft 8. In an\nembodiment, the adapter 6, is comprised of a center launch\nbracket and two side brackets, wherein the center launch\nbracket and two side brackets are temporarily attached to the\ncarrier 5. In one embodiment, the adapter 6 is temporarily\nattached to the carrier 5 by fasteners such as screws, nuts,\nbolts, or the like. In another embodiment (not otherwise\nshown), the adapter 6 is temporarily attached to the carrier\n5 by a plurality of self-actuating latchipin devices. Multiple\nmeans for attaching the adapter 6 to the carrier 5 exist. In this\nembodiment, the adapter 6 may utilize slots 43 to interface\nwith the aircraft. The number of slots 43 and their design\nmay be a function of the aircraft interface. Thus, for different\naircraft, different adapters may be switched out and temporarily connected to the carrier. The design as illustrated in the\nfigures is not intended in any way to limit other designs. As\nstated before, the adapter\xe2\x80\x99s design may be a function of the\naircraft interface. In another embodiment, the function of an\nadapter may be integrated with the carrier. In this embodiment (not otherwise shown), there is no separate adapter\nelement.\nWith reference to FIG. 2 and FIG. 9, in an embodiment,\na multiplicity of latex surgical tubes 7 is one means for\npropelling the carrier longitudinally along the track system\n4. In another embodiment, one latex surgical tube may be\nused. Latex may be natural latex. The one or more latex\nsurgical tubes 7 store potential energy and subsequently\nconvert the stored potential energy to kinetic energy necessary for propelling the carrier 5 and launching the aircraft 8.\nIn additional embodiments, other means for propelling the\ncarrier longitudinally along the track system 4 are used (such\nas one or more compression springs, one or more extension\nsprings, one or more roll springs, or one or more elongated\nelastic members such as one or more polyurethane bands,\none or more latex bands, one or more surgical tubes, one or\nmore silicone bands, or one or more bungee cords). The\nmeans for propelling the carrier longitudinally along the\ntrack system may be resistant to extreme temperatures, for\nexample, sub-zero temperatures. The means for propelling\nthe carrier longitudinally along the track system may operate\nin a temperature range from about -65 degrees F. to about\n180 degrees F. The means for propelling the carrier longitudinally along the track system may have an elongation at\nbreak up to about 750%.Another embodiment consists of a\ncombination of the defined means for propelling the carrier\n(not shown). If two or more means for propelling the carrier\n\nio\n\n2o\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n6o\n\n65\n\nUS 6,851,647 B1\n5\n\n6\n\nare used, these means for propelling may be installed\nparallel with respect to each other. An embodiment utilizes\none or more latex surgical tubes with a predetermined outer\ndiameter (OD). In another embodiment, depending on the\ninitial launch condition requirements, the OD for the latex\nsurgical tubes may be scaleable. This scalability may also\nresult in scaling the dimensions of other elements of the\napparatus (e.g., the elongated tracks, carrier, combinations\nof elements, all of the elements, etc.). With reference to FIG.\n2, a third embodiment may utilize five latex surgical tubes of\n0.625 inches OD latex surgical tubes attached to two mounting plates 9, 10 of rigid material (for example, a metal). In\nan embodiment, the means for propelling has two ends\nwherein connecting the means for propelling to each mounting plate 9, 10 may be accomplished by a capture screw 13\nsecured by a tie device 14 within both ends of the means for\npropelling as partially illustrated in FIG. 9. Multiple\nembodiments exist for the tie device 14, for example a wire\n(as illustrated in FIG. 9), a clip (not shown), or a clamp (not\nshown). In an embodiment, the means for propelling may\ncomprise one or more latex surgical tubes 7, thus, two sets\nof one or more capture screws (hereinafter referred to as the\nfirst set and second set of one or more capture screws) and\ntwo sets of one or more tie devices (hereinafter referred to\nas the first and second set of one or more tie devices) are\nrequired for this specific embodiment (one set for each end\nof the one or more latex surgical tubes 7). As illustrated in\nFIG. 2, in an embodiment, two mounting plates (hereinafter\nreferred to as the first mounting plate 9 and second mounting\nplate 10) may be required for each set of one or more capture\nscrews 13. In this embodiment, the first set of one or more\ncapture screws 13 may be attached to the first mounting plate\n9 and the second set of one or more capture screws 13 may\nbe attached to the second mounting plate 10. Further, one\nend of the one or more latex surgical tubes may be attached\nto the first set of the one or more capture screws 13.\nSecondly, the other end of the one or more latex surgical\ntubes 7 may be attached to the second set of the one or more\ncapture screws 13. Thirdly, the first set of one or more tie\ndevices 14 may be wrapped around one end of the one or\nmore latex surgical tubes 7 to secure the one end to the first\nset of the one or more capture screws 13. Finally, the second\nset of one or more tie devices 14 may be wrapped around the\nother end of the one or more latex surgical tubes 7 to secure\nthe other end to the second set of the one or more capture\nscrews 13. In an embodiment, the first mounting plate 9 may\nbe adjustably attached to the track system 4. Use of the first\nmounting plate 9, the first set of one or more capture screws\n13, and the first set of one or more tie devices 14 independently or in any combination represents one means to\nadjustably attached one end of the means for propelling\nrelative to the track system 4. As illustrated in FIG. 2, in an\nembodiment, the second mounting plate 10 may be connected to a first cable 11, which is described in more detail\nbelow. The use of a first cable 11, second mounting plate 10,\nsecond set of one or more capture screws 13, and second set\nof one or more tie devices 14 independently or in any\ncombination represents one second means for connecting the\nmeans for propelling to the carrier. In an embodiment, the\nfirst cable 11 may be permanently or temporarily affixed to\nthe carrier 5. The attachment of the means for propelling to\nthe track system 4 may be at any point, but it is recognized\nthat if this attachment is as far aft as possible relative to the\ntrack system 4, then this location maximizes the potential\nenergy storage and acceleration length. In addition; attachment of the means for propelling to the track system 4 may\nbe adjustable in a longitudinal manner thereby providing a\nmeans to vary the amount of potential energy necessary to\nlaunch aircraft of varying mass. In another embodiment, an\nultraviolet or \xe2\x80\x9cUV\xe2\x80\x9d coating 39 as illustrated in FIG. 2 may\nbe applied to the latex surgical tubes to protect the latex\nsurgical tubes from UV induced degradation.\n\nWith continued reference to FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3, and\nFIG. 4, in an embodiment, a manually driven winch system\n16, pulley 17, first cable 11, and second cable 18, may be\nused to move the carrier 5 into a launch position. In another\nembodiment, a motor driven winch system is used. As stated\nearlier, the first cable 11 is part of a second means for\nconnecting the means for propelling to the carrier 5 . Moving\nthe carrier 5 to the launch position increases the potential\nenergy of the means for propelling the carrier longitudinally\nalong the track system 4. As illustrated in FIG. 2, in an\nembodiment, the carrier 5 may be moved to the launch\nposition by a second cable 18 and the manually driven winch\nsystem 16. The second cable 18 is part of a third means for\nconnecting the carrier to the manually driven winch system\n16. With particular reference to FIG. 12, in an embodiment,\nthe connection of the second cable 18 to the carrier 5 may\ncomprise one or more cable spherical bearings 53 attached\nto the second cable 18 and a cable catch 54 attached to the\ncarrier 5 wherein one of the one or more cable spherical\nbearings 53 are fastened to the cable catch 54. More than one\nspherical bearing may be installed on the second cable 18 to\nprovide adjustability as well as redundancy in case of\ndamage. In an embodiment, the second cable may be unfastened to the cable catch 54 prior to launch but after the\ntrigger 28 (discussed below in more detail) has engaged the\ncarrier 5 . The second cable 18, one or more cable spherical\nbearings 53, and cable catch 54 individually or in any\ncombination is one third means of connecting the carrier 5\nto the manually driven winch system 16. An exploded view\nof an embodiment of the manually driven winch system is\nillustrated in FIGS. 7A and 7B. With reference to FIG. 7A\nand FIG. 7B, in an embodiment, the manually driven winch\nsystem 16 employs a tapered winch spool 19 to manually\nwind the second cable 18 and thus, move the carrier 5 into\nthe launch position by cranking a handle 20 while maintaining a relatively uniform input torque during the entire\nprocess of moving the carrier 5 into its launch position. In\nan embodiment, the winch handle 20 may be foldable. In\nanother embodiment, a non-foldable winch handle is used\n(not shown). Further, in the embodiment whereby the manually driven winch system 16 is used, a first worm gear 21 and\na second worm gear 22 may be used to provide the required\ngear reduction and avoid the back-drive potential of the\nwinding mechanism. In this embodiment, a threaded cylinder 23 may be employed to lock the first worm gear 21 and\ntapered winch spool 19 as an integrated winch system. As\nillustrated in FIGS. 7A, 7B, 18, and 19, in an embodiment,\nthe manually driven winch system 16 may be mounted on\none of the elongated tracks by a winch pin 24, which may\nbe attached to the threaded cylinder 23, a winch plate 25,\nwhich may be secured to the track system by the winch pin\n24 and threaded cylinder 23 assembly, as well as a selfactuating lock 55, which may be attached to the track system\n4 and secures the winch pin 24 to the track system 4. FIG.\n19 illustrates how an embodiment of a self-actuating lock 55\nengages a tapered end of a winch pin 24 such that the\nself-actuating lock slightly recoils via a simple spring\nmechanism and subsequently locks itself to the winch pin\n24. In an embodiment, a cover 26 may be employed as\nillustrated in FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B.\nWith continued reference to FIG. 1, FIG. 12, FIG. 21A,\nand FIG. 21B, a trigger 28 may lock the carrier 5 in the\nlaunch position as well as releases the carrier 5 from the\nlaunch position thereby launching the aircraft 8. The trigger\n28 is attached to an elongated track in such a location\nwherein the carrier 5 is temporarily locked to the trigger 28\nin a pre-launch position. In an embodiment, the trigger 28 is\ncomprised of a trigger block housing 44, trigger latch 45,\ntrigger release lever 46, and at least one spring (not otherwise shown) as is commonly known in the art. In an\nembodiment, the trigger 28 may be self-actuating. For\n\nio\n\n2o\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nso\n\n55\n\n6o\n\n65\n\nUS 6,851,647 B1\n\n7\n\n8\n\nexample, the carrier 5 is moved to a launch position and\ninterlocks with the trigger latch 45 in such a manner\nwhereby no manual intervention is required. Specifically, the\ntrigger latch 45 recoils upon contact with the carrier 5 ,\nwherein the recoil movement activates the at least one spring\nand the trigger release lever 46 in a coordinated movement.\nIn another embodiment, a non self-actuating trigger is used\n(not shown). With reference to FIG. 13, in an embodiment,\na safety pin 42 may be employed to ensure an unintentional\nlaunch does not occur. In this particular embodiment, the\nsafety pin 42 is placed in a predetermined position in front\nof the carrier 5 when the carrier 5 is in its pre-launch\nposition. Thus, if the trigger 28 is unintentionally activated,\nthe safety pin 42 if properly used, will retain the carrier 5 and\nprevent an unintentional launch.\nWith continued reference to FIG. 1 and reference to FIG.\n8, in an embodiment, a bi-pod stand 27 may be used to\nelevate and aid in the securing of the track system 4 in its\nfully extended configuration at a predetermined angle relative to a surface. Other embodiments for the stand, such as\ntri-pod, telescopic, and an adjustable jack exist (not shown).\nAs illustrated in FIG. 8, in an embodiment, a first cord 29\nmay be attached to one of the elongated members of the\nbi-pod stand 27 on one end and to the other elongated\nmember of the bi-pod stand on the other end secures the\ntrack system 4 to a surface. Specifically, rocks or other heavy\nmaterial may be set on top of the first cord thereby minimizing any movement of the track system 4 resultant from\na launch. In another embodiment, a second cord 32 may be\nattached to one of the elongated tracks and subsequently\nattached to a weight 33. In one embodiment, the weight may\nbe a container 34 (ref. FIG. 3) that is used to stow the\napparatus. In this manner, a downward force is applied to\nminimize movement of the track system 4 as a result of the\nlaunching process. Thus, the container 34 may serve two\nfunctions. The container\xe2\x80\x99s 34 primary function is to stow the\napparatus in its retracted configuration for easy transport.\nThe container may also serve as the weight 33 to minimize\nthe movement of the track system 4 during an actual launch.\nWith continued reference to FIG. 1 and FIG. 3, as well as\nreference to FIG. 15, an energy absorption barrier 35 may be\nused to absorb excess kinetic energy remaining at the end of\nthe launch sequence. In an embodiment, an energy absorbing material 36 may be sandwiched between two barrier\nplates 37, 38 to form the barrier 35. In an embodiment, the\nbarrier 35 may be installed at the end of one of the elongated\ntracks. The two barrier plates of rigid material 37,38 may be\nselected from a group consisting of metal, wood, plastic, and\ngraphite. In one embodiment, the two barrier plates may be\ncomprised of aluminum. The energy absorbing material may\nbe selected from a group consisting of polyurethane, a\nvisco-elastic polymer, and foam. For the purposes herein,\nfoam is defined as any of various light, porous, semi-rigid or\nspongy materials. For the purposes herein, visco-elastic is\ndefined as any material the exhibits properties of both\nliquids (viscous solutions) and solids (elastic materials).\nThe apparatus as described above has two basic configurations: the extended configuration (illustrated in FIG. 1)\nand the retracted configuration (illustrated in FIG. 3). In the\nextended configuration, the track system 4 is folded outward\nto its full length and may be interlocked. In the retracted\nconfiguration, the track system 4 is folded inward where it\nmay be interlocked and compactly stored in a backpack or\nother container.\nMultiple methods exist for using the various embodiments described above. With reference to FIGS. 1 , 2 , 3 and\n8, for example, in one method, the user un-stows the\napparatus from the container 34 and extends as well as\ninterlocks the track system 4, comprised of two elongated\ntracks, to its full length. The locking plate 49 is used to lock\n\nthe two elongated tracks together. The user then uses the\nbi-pod stand 27 to elevate and aid in the securing of the track\nsystem 4 in its fully extended configuration at a predetermined angle relative to a surface. The user then uses rocks\nor other heavy material on top of the first cord 29 attached\nto the bi-pod stand 27 to help secure the track system 4 to\nthe surface. The user next secures the container 34 to the\nsecond cord 32, which is attached to one of the elongated\ntracks and subsequently is used as a weight 33. After the\ntrack system 4 is secured to the surface, it is ready for\noperation. The user temporarily secures the second cable 18\nvia the attached spherical bearing 53 to the cable catch 54\nand then moves the carrier 5 to the launch position via a\nmanually driven winch system 16, pulley 17, first cable 11,\nand second cable 18 thereby extending the means for\npropelling the carrier, which herein in this embodiment\ncomprises a multiplicity of latex surgical tubes 7. The carrier\n5 is locked in a launch position by the trigger 28, which is\nself-actuating. The user employs the safety pin 42 in its\npredetermined location to ensure an unintentional launch\ndoes not occur. The user next temporarily attaches the\naircraft 8 to the adapter 6, which is temporarily secured to\nthe carrier 5 . When the user is ready to launch the aircraft 8,\nthe user will remove the safety pin 42 as well as the second\ncable 18 from the cable catch 54 and then release the trigger\n28. The subsequently conversion of stored potential energy\nto kinetic energy in the multiplicity of latex surgical tubes 7\npropels the carrier 5 along the track system 4. At the end of\nthe launch sequence, the carrier 5 impacts the energy adsorption barrier 35 and the aircraft 8 is launched. After the\naircraft 8 is launched, the user removes the rocks or other\nheavy material on top of the first cord 29 and de-attaches the\ncontainer 34 from the second cord 32. The user then\ndisengages the locking plate 49 to unlock the two elongated\ntracks. The user next retracts the apparatus, prepares the\napparatus for stowage, and stows the apparatus in the\ncontainer 34.\nThe corresponding structures, materials, acts, and equivalents of all means or step plus function elements in the\nclaims below are intended to include any structure, material,\nor acts for performing the functions in combination with\nother claimed elements as specifically claimed.\nThe embodiment of the apparatus described herein are\nonly for purposes of illustration and understanding of the\napparatus.
