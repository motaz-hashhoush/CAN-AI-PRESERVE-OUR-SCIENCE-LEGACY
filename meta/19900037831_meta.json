Broad-line flux variations correlated with nonstellar continuum changes were measured. H-beta, H-gamma, and He II 4686A all respond rapidly to continuum variations providing strong evidence for photoionization by a central continuum source. Additionally, H-beta profile variations have occurred during the 1900 day monitoring period. These profile variations also correlate with changes in the continuum, but lag behind by about 90 days or less. A kinematic model that incorporates radial outflow and an internal line opacity source is proposed to explain qualitatively the observed H-beta profile variations.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "350", "submissionId": 19900037831, "issn": "0004-637X", "id": "38c089ba15c94fea9d22db9d1805af28", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal, Part 1", "publicationDate": "1990-02-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
