This paper uses a real-time operations scenario to convey this message. The real-time operations scenario begins at the initiation of payload operations and runs through post run experiment analysis. In developing this scenario, it is assumed that the ISS payload operations flight and ground capabilities are fully available for use by the payload user community. Emphasis is placed on telescience operations whose main objective is to enable researchers to utilize experiment hardware onboard the International Space Station as if it were located in their terrestrial laboratory. An overview of the Payload Operations Integration Center (POIC) systems and user ground system options is included to provide an understanding of the systems and interfaces users will utilize to perform payload operations. Detailed information regarding POIC capabilities can be found in the POIC Capabilities Document, SSP 50304.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19990041198, "endDate": "1999-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Space Technology and Applications International Forum (STAIF-99)", "location": "Albuquerque, NM", "id": "0036b774ce554a739a41396400839d45", "startDate": "1999-01-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990041198, "id": "950ab6334b454ae78043e920831d94cf", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990041198.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990041198/downloads/19990041198.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990041198/downloads/19990041198.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990041198/downloads/19990041198.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
