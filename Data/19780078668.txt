Heyman was presented his award at a\nbanquet in Chicago Sept. 21.\n\nThis is the first time that\n\na single individual has been selected three times by the\nmagazine for research work.\n\nHeyman\'s previous awards were\n\nin 1974 and 1976.\n\n-mor.e-\n\nOnclas\n\n-2The 1978 device, jointly developed at Langley and at\nWashington University, St. Louis, is called an acoustoelectric transducer.\n\nIt greatly improves the accuracy of\n\nmeasuring deviations in structural properties by using\nvery high-pitched sound waves.\n\nThe advantage of the acoustoelectric transducer over\nconventional transducers is its insensitivity to the shape\nof sound waves.\n\nNew information provided by the device will\n\nallow researchers to more accurately identify and evaluate\nmaterial flaws and to characterize biomedical specimens and\ntissue.\n\nResearch on the acoustoelectric transducer was con-"\nducted by Dr. Heyman, of Langley Center\'s Instrument Research\nDivision, and by Dr. James G. Miller, professor of physics,\nand Lawrence J. Busse, research physicist, both of Washington University\'s Laboratory for Ultrasonics.\n\nHeyman\'s research concentrated on the measurement of\nmaterials, while Miller and Busse studied the medical applications of the new device.\n\n-more-\n\n-3-\n\nHeyman\'s first IR-100 award, presented in 1974, was\nfor the development of a medical monitoring device.\n\nCalled\n\na continuous wave ultrasonic microemboli monitor, it is an\nultrasonic instrument that monitors impurities in a patient\'s\nblood during open-heart surgery.\n\nThis instrument, compact in size, easy to operate and\nrelatively cheap, was also jointly developed by Heyman and\nresearchers at Washington University.\n\nIn 1976 Heyman won\n\nhis second IR-100 award for the\n\ndevelopment of an ultrasonic bolt stress monitor.\n\nIt mea-\n\nsures the strain in bolts with an ultrasonic instrument that\ncan indicate changes in bolt strain to better than one part\nin 10,000.\n\nThe bolt monitor is portable, easy to use, in-\n\nexpensive and extremely accurate.\n\nThe 100 winning 1978 new products are being displayed\nfor several weeks at Chicago\'s Museum of Science and Industry\nfor engineers, scientists, educators and the general public.\n\n-end-\n\n'
