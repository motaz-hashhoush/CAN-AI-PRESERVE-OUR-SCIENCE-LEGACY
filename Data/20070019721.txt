b"Solar Energy Demonstrations\nThe building at upper left houses the\noffices of the Reedy Creek Utilities\nCompany, a Walt Disney Productions\nsubsidiary which provides utility services for the 27,000-acre Walt Disney\nWorld resort complex at Orlando,\nFlorida. The photos below show the\n\nVisitors Center at Mount Rushmore,\nSouth Dakota. These are two of more\nthan 100 solar-powered facilities\nmanaged by NASA's Marshall Space\nFlight Center for the Department of\nEnergy's National Solar Heating and\nCooling Demonstration Project. Aim\nof the program is to promote national\nenergy conservation by stimulating\n\ninterest in solar energy as an alternative to fossil fuels.\nSolar energy furnishes all of the heating and hot water needs, plus 80 percent of the air conditioning, for the\ntwo-story Reedy Creek building. A\nunique feature of this installation is\nthat the 16 semi-cylindrical solar collectors (center photo on opposite\npage with closeup of a single collector below it) are not mounted atop the\nroof as is customary, they actually are\nthe roof. This arrangement eliminates\nthe usual trusses, corrugated decking\nand insulating concrete in roof construction; that, in turn, reduces overall building costs and makes the solar\ninstallation more attractive economically. The Reedy Creek collectors were\ndesigned and manufactured by AAI\nCorporation of Baltimore, Maryland.\nThe Mount Rushmore installation is\nsomewhat different. It employs 112\nindividual collectors which are\nsmaller than Reedy Creek's and are\nflat plates rather than concave. They\nsupply more than half the building's\nheatinglhot water needs and about 40\npercent of the cooling requirement.\nLennox Industries, Marshalltown,\nIowa produced the Mount Rushmore\ncollectors.\nMarshall Space Flight Center's role in\nthe National Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Project is that of\nsupervisor and technical advisor for a\nvariety of demonstrations in such\nfacilities as industrial plants, office\nbuildings, schools, museums, libraries and private homes. The Center\nlends its broad solar energy expertise\nin handling contract negotiations, reviewing designs and overseeing construction. A major Marshall responsibility is monitoring solar equipment\nperformance. Sensors installed by the\nCenter's engineers take frequent data\nsamplings at each sire. The information is stored on tape and relayed\nonce a day to a central processing\nfacility at Marshall's Huntsville,\nAlabama headquarters. There it is\nanalyzed and evaluated to determine\nthe effectiveness of the various types\nof equipment being used in different\nparts of the country, providing information that can be applied to development of advanced solar energy\nsystems for the future.\n\n"
