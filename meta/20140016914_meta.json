The data support the hypothesis that export of wine by ship from Etruria in central Italy to southern Mediterranean France fueled an ever-growing market and interest in wine there, which, in turn, as evidenced by the winepress, led to transplantation of the Eurasian grapevine and the beginning of a Celtic industry in France. Herbal and pine resin additives to the Etruscan wine point to the medicinal role of wine in antiquity, as well as a means of preserving it during marine transport.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"volume": "110", "submissionId": 20140016914, "issue": "25", "publisher": "National Academy of Sciences", "id": "d6508fcbc0a14a3db4aea6c841f6fea7", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "publicationDate": "2013-06-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20140007395, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Beginning of Viniculture in France", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140016914.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140016914/downloads/20140016914.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140016914/downloads/20140016914.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140016914/downloads/20140016914.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
