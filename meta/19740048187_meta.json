The hydromagnetic  dynamo equations are used here, as particularly appropriate for such  an investigation. The calculations show that in one case the exact and approximate solutions agree. In the other case the approximate solution is wrong. Hence, in the absence of a general criterion for validity, a result based on first order smoothing theory is a conjecture rather than a fact. This impacts strongly on much of the recent work on hydromagnetic dynamos.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "14", "submissionId": 19740048187, "id": "72dbbb4acf1f47efaeb2e176f8f57189", "publicationName": "Journal of Mathematical Physics", "publicationDate": "1973-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
