The frequencies would have to be high enough to pass through the atmosphere relatively unattenuated but low enough that antennas and transmission lines would not be so critical in length and properties that unexperienced students would have difficulty with handling them. In conversations with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington D.C., the frequencies of 450.000 MHz and 137.900 MHz were decided upon and applied for licensing. The 450.000 MHt up-link is used on a \"non-interference\" basis to control the satellite while the 137.900 MHz frequency down-links data from the satellite.\n\nA reasonable amount of time was spent discussing the mods of transmission to be used in communication with the satellite. Representatives of the amateur radio satellite organization, AMSAT, were contacted for ides. This organization seems to favor AM types of emissions such as CW to control their OSCAR series of satellites and also the current Phase 111 unit. NUSAT personnel felt, however, that there would be merit in the improved signal to noise ratio usually obtained in an FM mode. Doppler shift of the transmitted information on the NUSAT also had to be considered. The final decision WBS to use Audio Frequency Shift Keying (AFSK) modulated on an FM carrier. In this mode the audio tones used would not shift frequency with Doppler - only the carrier would shift in frequency. If necessary, the receivers could be fitted with a form of AFC control or simply have enough bandwidth to handle the Doppler shift with an acceptable increase in noise.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 19860017829, "endDate": "1985-10-09T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "e081fcbdcd5059fa8fa7b6c5c6a2c483", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, Maryland, United States"}}, "meetingId": "92efb0d6919446a1a51914870ef59922", "id": "7776a7f1551e446fa37a06f2bb0caa20"}], "name": "Get Away Special Experimenter's Symposium", "location": "Greenbelt, MD", "id": "92efb0d6919446a1a51914870ef59922", "startDate": "1985-10-08T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860017829, "publisher": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "id": "375ecc8ded8d424992eb29a8648d36d0", "publicationName": "1985 Get Away Special Experimenter's Symposium", "publicationDate": "1985-10-08T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "issuePublicationDate": "1986-01-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19860017825, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "The 1985 Get Away Special Experimenter's Symposium", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PUBLICATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19860017829.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19860017829/downloads/19860017829.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19860017829/downloads/19860017829.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19860017829/downloads/19860017829.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
