It is shown that such schemes do not always converge to the correct physical answer. The approach presented here is to construct schemes that numerically satisfy the second law of thermodynamics on a cell-by-cell basis. Such schemes can only converge to the correct physical solution and in some cases can be shown to be TVD. An explicit scheme with this property and second-order spatial accuracy was found to have extremely restrictive time-step limitation. Switching to an implicit scheme removed the time-step limitation.", "title": "Smoothing and the second law", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T15:42:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880050132, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Merriam, Marshal L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "299ef97c26e54581944f0b5f5f8e190d"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880050132, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1016/0045-7825(87)90039-9", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "64", "submissionId": 19880050132, "issn": "0045-7825", "id": "2313148dda9a4c4ba055600c7053fe29", "publicationName": "Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering", "publicationDate": "1987-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
