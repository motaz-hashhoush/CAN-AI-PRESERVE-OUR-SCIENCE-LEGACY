Effects of contamination from these sources are being quantified and have been reported on in several papers. For a designer, the essential question is how much contamination from all sources can be tolerated without causing a given spacecraft system to degrade below a critical performance level, or fail altogether. Even a rudimentary knowledge of the mechanisms by which molecular and particulate contamination can occur will allow simple design options to be chosen to circumvent potential contamination problems and reduce contamination levels. Because of the varied nature and condition of hardware used on LDEF experiments, examples of many types of contamination were seen and these provide a useful guide to expected performance of many types of materials in space environments.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940026515, "id": "e9bab6a1784245478b24b2885bb67158", "publicationName": "NASA.
