b'Science Teacher Fred Holtzclaw\nHas Successfully Created Energy In\nA ClassrooIn.\nIn the nearly 20 years that Mr. Holtzclaw has been teaching high\nschool science in Tennessee, he\'s learned a lot about energy. How to impart\nenthusiasm, for instance. The hard work needed to overcome inertia. And most\ndifficult of all, what to do about burn-out.\nHe\'s not alone. Every day, teachers allover the country face the\nsame challenges.\nThat\'s why Martin Marietta is helping to underwrite a new regional\nAcademy for Teachers of Science and Math at the University of Tennessee. It\'s\nan intensive program of study and discussion for Martin Marietta Fellows; outstanding educators in all grade levels. Through the Academy, the private sector,\ngovernment and academia are all joining together to support a critical educational\ninitiative by President Bush.\nIt\'s important to help keep things moving in the classroom, and teachers\nlike Fred Holtzclaw are the right place to start. If we want to fire-up the masterminds of tomorrow, the best thing we can do is IWARTIN IWARIETTA\nkeep our outstanding teachers energized today. 6801 ROCKLEDGE DRIVE, BETHESDA, MARYLAND 20817\n,\n\nMASTERMINDING TOMORROW; TEGINOLOGIE5\n\n\xc2\xa9 1990 Martin Mariena Corporalion\n\nTo some, 300 dots per inch may seem quite adequate.\nTo old Spot here, the 300 dpi of conventional laser printers is good enough.

We didn\'t. Did you know about the\nimpending cataclysmic changes in\nEastern Europe? We didn\'t, not even in\nour wildest dreams.\nWhat we did know was that we were\nin an election year, and several congressmen had suggested that NASA\ncontractors hire advertising agencies to\ngenerate support for NASA because\nthey weren\'t hearing much from their\nconstituents and thought that the American people didn \'t care about the space\nprogram . Dr. James C. Fletcher, then\nthe administrator of NASA, warned, "...the\nnation\'s civil space program is facing\nextinction this year." We weren\'t thrilled\nwith that prospect, and in this column in\nJuly 1988 I wrote :\nI wondered what we at Associated\nBusiness Publications could do to help\nspread the word. I\'ve long been a believer that a few determined people can\nmake a difference, so I wrote to every\nrepresentative, senator, and presidential aspirant, asking them to state whether\nthey were for or against a strong national space program.\nIn total, I received 47 responses, all\nin favor of a strong space program. That\nleaves another 500 government decision-makers who did not respond. Which\nis why we need your help. From the\nthousands of feedback cards we read\nevery month, we know that there are\nfew Americans more aware of the benefits we have all obtained through the\nactivity of NASA and its contractors than\nthe readers of NTB. These feedback\ncards also attest that you \'re eloquent\nletter writers.\n\nA\n\nTherefore, we thought this would be\nan apt time to announce a writing contest in which everybody wins. In honor\nof Independence Day, and in the interest of continuing a long line of future Independence Days, we hereby announce\na contest for the best letters in support\nof NASA and U.S. space exploration\nwritten to government leaders.\nIt worked so well that NASA Tech\nBriefs\' editorial board was swamped\nwith over 1000 letters. We had a difficult\ntime determining the winner. Make that\nwinners. We never dreamed that children would enter a contest in a highly\ntechnical magazine, but enter they did,\nand we decided to establish a children \'s\ncategory.\nSince then we have seen President\nBush commit the U.S. to landing astronauts on Mars by 2019. In establishing\nthe Space Exploration Initiative, which\naims to send humans to the moon and\nthen on to Mars, the President has\nrequested $1 billion in the fiscal year\n1991 budget. That\'s fine ...but congress\nhas to appropriate the money. To help\n"raise the consciousness" of our representatives, we are initiating another\ncontest, which we hope will be even\nmore successful than the last.\nOne major improvement in this year\'s\ncontest: We\'re not doing the judging.\nThe National Space Society (NSS) is\ncosponsoring the contest with us, and\nwill set up a blue-ribbon panel of judges.\nLetters will be judged on strength of\nargument and creativity.\nHere\'s how the contest works: Write\na letter of 500 words or less to the\npolitician(s) of your choice, outlining your\nreasons for asking him or her to support\nthe President\'s Space Exploration Ini-\n\ntiative. Then send a copy of your letter(s)\nto the National Space Society at the\naddress listed on page 12. All letters\nreceived by August 15, 1990 will be\njudged by the NSS panel, and the winning letters in the adults\' and children\'s\ncategories will be published in the October issues of both NASA Tech Briefs\nand Ad Astra, an official NSS magazine.\nAll letter writers will be listed on an honor\nroll appearing in the October editions of\nboth publications. Further, we plan to\nsend copies of the letters to every congressman on the Hill.\nThe grand prize winners will receive\na tuition-free stay at the United States\nSpace Camp , an educational camp that\nsimulates an astronaut\'s training program. Second prize in the adults\' category is a VIP invitation to a space shuttle\nlaunch. Five merit winners will each\nreceive one free category from the\nNTB:BASE software library, a PC-compatible database covering over 25 years\nof NASA technology.\nGentlepeople, we are all responsible\nfor what will or will not happen to our"\nspace program. We can\'t afford to wait\nfor the other guy to do it for us. So\nplease, start those letters flowing to the\npoliticians. This is a contest in which\nevery American will prove ultimately to\nbe a winner.

It is the\ngreatest leap in astronomy since\nGalileo first gazed into a telescope in 1609.\nNo telescope has ever been\nthis precise. Its eight-foot primary\nmirror is smooth to within a haIfa-millionth of an inch. And its fine\nguidance system can lock onto a\nhummingbird 1500 miles away.\nBoth are part of Hubble\'s\nOptical Telescope Assembly,\ndesigned and developed by\nHughes Danbury Optical Systems,\nformerly part of Perkin-Elmer\nand now a subsidiary of Hughes\nAircraft Company.\nOrbiting high above the earth\'\natmosphere, the Hubble Space\nTelescope will have a clear view\n\nof the universe.

At the\nheart of this mission is an x-ray\ntelescope system now being\ndeveloped by Hughes Danbury\nOptical Systems. It will reveal\nlight patterns in outer space that\noptical telescopes can\'t see. And it\ncould help us uncover the secrets\nof "black holes;\' perhaps the key\nto understanding how the universe was formed.\nWe have also set our sights on\nsomething much closer to home.\nOur own planet\nIn NASKs "Mission to Planet\nEarth;\' our technology will help\n\nscientists study the earth\'s\nenvironment from distant observation points, to find ways of\nmaking our precious planet a\nsafer, healthier place.

Among the telescopes in operation or\nunder construction on Mauna Kea is the threemeter NASA infrared telescope, which is pioneering the use of infrared detector arrays that\nfunction much like a charge-coupled device\n(CCD) but are sensitive to infrared light.\nThe Big Island is also the proposed site for\nwhat could be America\'s first commercial satellite launch facility. As the southernmost point\nin the country, it offers the potential for both\npolar and equatorial launches.\nAs an island state, Hawaii has a long history of both marine research and aquaculture.\nThe ancient Hawaiians invented aquaCUlture;\nthey built ingenious fish ponds which were\nclosed on all sides except for small openings to\nthe sea. Young fish could enter through a\ngrating of bamboo to feed on the rich nutrients\nin the pond. As the little fish ate, they grew too\nbig to get back through the grate and out of the\npond. Today Hawaii is a center of aquaculture\ndevelopment for the world.\nOther high-tech developments seem to be\nhappy accidents. In electronics, communications, and biotechnology, innovative companies were formed because the people who\nfounded them happened to be in Hawaii. And\nthey had a chance to succeed because the\nstate has made a comm itment to the support of\nhigh-tech industry as part of its goal of a\ndiversified economy.\n\nT\n\nRenewable Energy\nSince the 1973 oil crisis, Hawaii has encouraged the development of renewable energy alternatives aimed at energy self-sufficiency and has established several organizations to conduct research and foster the commercialization of renewable energy.\nThe Hawaii Natural Energy Institute is a\nchild of the gas lines, created in 1974 at the\nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa, to "coordinate\n\nand undertake the development of non-polluting natural energy sources for Hawaii." Institute researchers calculate that Hawaii currently uses about 32 billion kilowatt hours\nequivalent of energy annually. In theory, any\none of Hawaii\'s prime renewable energy resources-biomass, geothermal , ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) , solar, or wind\n-could produce more than enough power to\nmeet this demand. And the maximum combined potential from all renewable energy\nsources would yield almost fifteen times the\ncurrent demand.\nThe Pacific International Center for High\nTechnology Research (PICHTR) was established in 1983 to assist the state\'s High Technology Development Corporation in promoting\neducational, scientific, technological, and literary pursuits in the areas of high technology\nand to support Hawaii technology industry.\nPICHTR has become a major player-along\nwith the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii\n(NELH)- in the development of both openand closed-cycle OTEC technology and is\nworking to establish a model utility tied into\nnatural energy sources on the island of Maui.\n\nOTEC Research\nIn open -cycle OTEC, warm surface ocean\nwater is brought into a vacuum chamberwhere\nitturns into steam to push a turbine. The steam\nis condensed by cold water pumped up from\ndeep in the ocean. This maintains the vacuum\nand pressure on the turbine and also produces\nfresh water.\nClosed-cycle OTEC uses warm surface\nwater to evaporate ammonia, which expands\nand pushes the turbine, and is then condensed\nby cold, deep ocean water. In the late 1970s,\nthe state conducted a mini-OTEC test project\nwhich showed a net gain in power after pumping the cold water up from two thousand feet\nbelow the surface. This provided conclusive\nproof of the concept, and could have led to\ncommercialization of OTEC, had the price of\noil not collapsed. Throughout the 1980s,\nNELH conducted experiments on bio-fouling\nof the plumbing that would handle the sea\nwater. One of the high-expense items of\nOTEC in past analyses has been the heat\nexchanger, which had been made of titanium\nto prevent corrosion. A much less expensive\nalloy of aluminum that is resistant to sea water\ncorrosion has been developed by the Argonne\nNational Laboratory and tested at NELH , lowering the overall cost projections for success-\n\nProduced by NASA Tech Briefs Magazine\n\nGeothermal power is not a new idea-the\nItalians built the first commercially successful\ngeothermal plant at Lardarelio , Italy, in 1904.\nThe Big Island, with two active volcanoes, is a\nprime geothermal location. The state had a\ndemonstration plant producing about three\nmegawatts of power on the Big Island from\n1981 to 1989. Hawaiian Electric Company\nissued a request for proposals in May 1989 for\ndevelopment of geothermal power on the Big\nIsland and delivery of the power generated to\nthe island of Oahu, which contains 80 percent\nof the state\'s population. Five consortia responded and negotiations are under way with\na group headed by Mission Power of Southern\nCalifornia and Bechtel.\nPlants will be constructed in modules of 25\nto 50 megawatts, adding up to a nominal 500\nmegawatts. To carry the power 300 miles from\nthe Big Island to Oahu, an innovative deep\nwater power cable is required . Research on\nthe Hawaii Deep Water Cable Project ended\nwith successful sea trials which laid a model\ncable early this year.\n\nThe Maul Model\nMaui Electric Company was chosen to\ndevelop a model solar power project under the\numbrella of a nationwide program, Photovoltaics for Utility Scale Applications (PVUSA), in\nwhich government and industry are working\ntogether to generate electricity cost-effectively\nusing solar energy. The $500 thousand test\nsystem will produce 20 kilowatts of electricity.\nMaui Electric is also the front-runner in a\nproject headed by the Department of Energy to\ncreate a model Pacific utility, tying in several\nrenewable energy sources. Maui Electric now\nhas solar, wind , biomass, and hydroelectric\npower coming into its grid-in addition to\npower generated by fossil fuel-and looks to\ngeothermal power for the future. The company\nis now interconnecting its neighboring islands\nof Lanai and Molokai. Therefore it can serve\nas a model power company for any Pacific\nisland.\n\nBasic Energy Sources\nIn Hawaii the trade winds blow almost\ncontinuously. On one hill on the Big Island\nalone, one can count 297 wind turbines at\nwork. The problems with wind power under\nstudy by the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute\nand Hawaii\'s power compan ies are : almost\nconstant variation in output due to fluctuations\nin the wind force ; energy storage; and interface with the utility grid. One proposal would\nuse excess wind power to pump water from\nthe wet side of the island to a reservoir in the\nmountains, from which it could be released on\nthe dry side to drive a hydroelectric plant and at\nthe same time provide water for irrigation.\nHawaii\'s sugar mills burn the sugar cane\nplants, after the sugar has been extracted, to\ngenerate power to run the mills. Biomass from\nwood chips and other sources is also used for\npower generation . Excess power is sold to\nutility companies.\nElectriCity, however, accounts for only\nabout 30 percent of the state\'s energy needs.\n\nThe Other Maui\n\nThe Maui Research & Technology Park is a new development on the island of Maui which boasts\nthe fastest economic growth in Hawaii. The Park is an ideal location for high-technology enterprises\nand supporting activities such as research and development, office and business, manufacturing and\nwarehousing, and other uses consistent with its general plan. A special Maui County R& T Park\nordinance has streamlined the permit process to facilitate development, and the Park\'s\ndesign guidelines will ensure the integrity of long-term investment.\nWithin the Park, a state of Hawaii-sponsored Research & Technology Center will\nprovide incubator space for emerging technology-based businesses and a phase-in\ncenter for established companies considering a location in the Park. It will also\ncontain centers for video and telecommunications, business support, and University of Hawaii-related activities.\nMaui\'s special geographic position makes it an advantageous location for firms\ndoing business in the Asian I Pacific sphere - exchanges between the East\nCoast and the Far East are possible on the same business day;\nfrequent non-stop flights are available from Hawaii to most major\ndomestic and Pacific Rim cities; and satellite and fiber optics\ncable allow excellent communication worldwide. In addition, the state provides monetary incentives that include low\ninterest loans and tax advantages.\nExcellent ocean and mountain views are available, and all\nsites offer open space, privacy and security in a\ncontrolled environment. Located on 330 acres of\nformer ranch land, the R & T Park is buffered\nfrom the highway by an 18-hole golf course.\nFee simple sites in the first 60-acre phase are\nnow available for sale.\n\nFar more energy is needed to fuel ships, aircraft, and surface vehicles. The Hawaii Natural Energy Institute and PICHTR are exploring\nways in which methanol could be used to\nreplace fossil fuel. This requires not only\ntechnical ability to create methanol from biomass, but also a parallel or alternative infrastructure which will provide methanol as a fuel,\nalong with engines equipped to burn it.\nHydrogen may well be the fuel of choice in\nthe 21 st century. And Hawaii is the site of\nWorld Hydrogen Energy Conference Number\nEight, in July, reflecting the state\'s preeminence in natural energy research .\n\nOcean Science and\nMarine Research\nInternational law now recognizes a 200\nmile zone-the Exclusive Economic Zone\n(EEZ)-within which coastal nations have\nsovereign and exclusive rights over living and\nnonliving resources. For Hawaii, the increase\nwas dramatic. With the 200 mile zone extending around the entire archipelago from the Big\nIsland to Kure Atoll , Hawaii jumped from 47th\nto second among states (behind Alaska) in\ncombined land and sea area.\nSeveral sites on the ocean floor appear to\nbe rich in manganese crusts, from which the\nstrategiC metal cobalt can be extracted. There\nis potential for an undersea mining operation\nand a processing operation to extract the\ncobalt. Most estimates place this fifteen to\ntwenty years away.\nA growing area of research and development is the production of pharmaceutical products from the sea, which promises economic\nbenefits from EEZ resources.\nHawaii is assuming a leadership position in\nocean science and marine research . With one\nof the most extensive and accessible EEZs,\nHawaii has the potential to become America\'s\nR&D center for EEZ use.\n\nDeep Wat er Cab le\nAn example is the Hawaii Deep Water\nCable Project, designed to test the feasibility of\ncarrying 500 megawatts of geothermal power\nfrom the island of Hawaii to Oahu . Most of the\nprevious research on deep water cables remains the proprietary information of private\ncompanies outside the United States. The\nDeep Water Cable Project advances American scientific knowledge in this field to the\ncutting edge of current research activity. "The\nfederal government doesn\'t care so much\nabout geothermal energy in Hawaii," stated\nWilliam A. Bonnet, director, engineering research, for Hawaiian Electric.\n\'\'They\'ve\nfunded this research to pick up technology\nwhich can be used by American industry in the\nUnited States and elsewhere."\nAnd there is real international interest.\nBoston Edison, for instance, wants to bring up\nto 1200 megawatts of power from a coal-fired\ngenerator in Nova Scotia, 250 miles away by\nsea. Further, the Iceland Power Company\nwould like to export power to the United Kingdom via a 600 mile cable from Iceland to Scotland at a maximum depth of 3000 feet.\nMakai Ocean Engineering, a Hawaii firm\nconducting research and development of\nocean systems, created a real-time model for\nlaying the cable at a precise tension in a\nspecific location. At a depth of 4000 feet, technicians will have to install three cables which\n\nPholO courtesy Seafloor Surveys InU.\n\nComputers turn sonar data into charts of\nthe ocean floor.\ndon\'t overlap within a width of 260 feet at a\nradius of curvature of four-tenths of a mile. In\nthe at-sea test, the model cable had to be laid\nat the narrowest point within plus or minus ten\nmeters of its intended path. The actual placement of the cable was plus or minus three\nmeters.\n"As a result of this project, nobody in the\nworld knows more about designing and installing submarine power cables than the participants in this program," Bonnet said. "This is\npublic information . But the expertise-the experience of having been through the process-is here in Hawaii."\n\ntotally supported by buoyancy from those fully\nsubmerged hulls, rather than by hydrodynamic lift as with a hydrofoil or planing craft.\nThe design is said to virtually eliminate seasickness and crew fatigue, offer more usable\ndeck space, and permit the ~hip to maintain\nspeed and direction in rough silas. Immediate\napplication is as a passenger carrier. Navatek\nI has been chartered for use in the tourist\nindustry, runn ing whale-watching tours, charters, and dinner cruises.\nNavatek I represents an exclUSively private-sector investment of $4.5 million over\ntwelve years by Hawaii-owned Pacific Marine.\nThe company\'s subsidiary, Honolulu Shipyard, Inc., is exploring the economics and\nmanpower requ irements for fabricating\nSWATH subassemblies in Hawaii and perhaps even building complete SWATH vessels\nof a smaller size. Pacific Marine\'s R&D affiliate, PAMESCO, already designs SWATH\nships in Honolulu , employing computer specialists, marine engineers, and design draftsmen.\n\nAstronomy and Space\nThere is no better place on the surface of\n\nChartin g The Ocean F loor\nSeafloor Surveys International is a Hawaii\ncompany whose specialty is charting the\nocean floor. The company\'s clients include\ntelecommunications giants such as AT&T,\nwho is stringing fiber optic cable along the\nbottoms of the world\'s oceans. By creating\nprecise charts of the ocean floor, Seafloor\nSurveys is able to recommend optimum routes\nfor the cables. This makes life easier for the\ndeployment crews and avoids the hazardous\nareas where accidents and cable losses can\noccur.\nSeafloor\'s technology is based on sidescanning sonar and a proprietary computer\nprogram which turns the sonar data into a\nuseful chart of the ocean bottom . For the\nscientists and engineers who study the maps,\nit is almost as though the ocean has been\npoured off, leaving only dry land. On one\nsurvey operation near Hawaii, the sonar encountered a puzzling formation which turned\nout to be the wreck of a B-24 bomber that\ndisappeared during World War II.\nA year ago the company built a survey\nsystem for a research vessel operated by the\nUniversity of Tokyo and the Japanese Ministry\nof Education. Currently, the company is engaged in what chief engineer Grant Blackinton\ncalls "one of the largest survey jobs ever done.\nOffshore Telecommunications Company of\nAustralia has hired us to survey the route for a\ncable from Hawaii to New Zealand and from\nAustralia to Guam."\n\nSWATH Vessel\nNavatek I, the pioneering high-technology\nSWATH (Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull)\nship, is an example of "home-grown" technology. The patented design was invented by\nProfessor Ludwig H. Seidl, chairman of the\nDepartment of Ocean Engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The principal components of a SWATH ship are two submerged\nlower hulls of varying cross section connected\nto upper hulls (sponsons) by four struts which\npierce the water surface and connect to a\nplatform riding above the water. The vessel is\n\nthe Earth from which to look out into space\nthan the 13,000 foot summit of Mauna Kea on\nthe Big Island of Hawaii. According to Bob Joseph, director of the NASA Infrared Telescope\nFacility, "Images are really sharp from the top\nof Mauna Kea. Infrared light doesn\'t get\nthrough the atmosphere easily , but there are\nsome windows. The higher and drier you are\nthe better. Mauna Kea is high and dry."\nClose behind is the 10,000 foot summit of\nHaleakala crater on Maui. home of the Mees\nSolar Observatory. The remarkable clarity,\ndryness, and stillness of the air above these\nisolated high-altitude sites has resulted in the\nstate of Hawaii becoming, over the last 20\nyears, the most sought-after location in the\nworld for the construction of large groundbased telescopes.\nSix telescope facilities are in place on\nMauna Kea. A seventh, the W. M. Keck Observatory, which will house the largest telescope in the world, is under construction.\nOther projects under discussion or in the\nplanning stages for Mauna Kea include the\n7.S-meter Japanese Large National Telescope, an 8-meter National Optical Astronomy\nObservatory telescope, and antenna of the\nVery Long Baseline Array (VLBA) radio telescope.\n\nThe House of the Sun\nHaleakala, which means "House of the\nSun" in Hawaiian, is the site of the Mees Solar\nObservatory, which has a wide range of instruments for study of the sun and its corona.\nHaleakala is also the site of the Lunar Ranging\nObservatory of the University of Hawaii, which\nuses a Neodymium YAG laser to reflect pulses\nfrom the moon and from Earth satellites, yielding essential data for the study of continental\ndrift, polar motion , and the determination of\nUniversal Time. These observations are also\nrelevant for studies of general relativity and the\npossible time dependence of the gravitational\nconstant.\n\nSatellite Spotting\nat Science City\nThe Maui Satellite Tracking Site (MSTS),\nlocated at Science City at the summit of Hal-\n\neakala, operates several space-related programs. MOTIF (Maui Optical Tracking and\nIdentification Facility) consists of twin 1.2\nmeter telescopes mounted on opposite sides\nof a single polar or right ascension axis, and\nattached to a common declination axis, so that\nthey move precisely in unison . MOTIF operates every night, tracking satellites.\nAMOS (Air Force Maui Optical Station) is\ndedicated to furthering research and development efforts in electro-optics. Using AMOS,\nAvco Research Laboratory (ARL) -TEXTRON, which manages the facility for the Air\nForce, has helped more than 20 government\nagencies and several universities run experiments. "We\'ve worked with Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory, MIT/Lincoln Labs, and many others: said Tom Reed, managing director of\nARL-TEXTRON. "We have tested cameras\nfor the University of California (Berkeley) and\nthe University of Arizona. And we have recently been doing polarization measurements\nover the open ocean for the Navy."\nGEODSS (Ground-Based Electro-Optical\nDeep Space Surveillance), operated by\nEmhart Planning Research Corporation, is the\nbackbone of Space Command\'s Electro-Optical Sensor Systems, and dovetails nicely with\nMOTIF, while its method of operation is\nunique. The GEODSS system consists of\nthree telescopes-two primaries and one\nauxiliary-that are smaller than either the\nMOTIF or AMOS telescopes.\nAccording to Major Richard Kelly, MSTS\nsite commander, "Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance, as its name\nimplies, is primarily used for tracking objects in\ndeep space or beyond 3000 miles. Due to\nconstraints in the design, we physically cannot\nget a good track on anything closer. " Unlike the\nother systems which lock onto particular objects and follow them as they pass overhead,\nGEODSS synchronizes its movement with the\nstars. "With GEODSS we can track an object\nthe size of a grapefruit up to 20,000 miles out in\nspace: said Kelly.\nAs the telescope slowly moves with the\nrotation of the Earth, the low-light-level TV\ncameras connected to GEODSS take a series\nof pictures which are overlaid and fed into a\ncomputer. The computer then erases the fixed\nstar images, leaving visible only the trace of\nany non-fixed or orbiting object. Over a period\nof time these moving space objects produce a\nstreak across the display screen which can be\nanalyzed for poSition in orbits from 3000 to\n22 ,000 miles. GEODSS tracks an average of\n300 space objects a night, and with its close\ntolerances, Ihere isn\'t much that escapes its\nnotice.\n\nSpaceport Project\nHawaii has been a part of America\'s space\neffort since the days of the Mercury Program.\nThe Kokee tracking station on Kauai has been\nan Integral part of manned space flight.\nWith one foot already on the stairway to the\nstars, Hawaii took another step toward space\nlast year when Governor John D. Waihee\nnamed Admiral Thomas B. Hayward, retired\nU.S. Chief of Naval Operations, to serve as\nchairman of the Hawaii Space Development\nAuthority and to be his special advisor on\nspace.\nState officials and consultants have been\ndeveloping plans to build the world\'s first\ncommercial launch center in Hawaii. If all goes\nwell, by 1992-the International Space Yearground will be broken for a commercial launch\nfacility for unmanned, small to mid-sized\n\nrockets in the Ka\'u region of the Big Island.\nThis would take advantage of Hawaii\'s unique\ngeography. Hawaii is nearer the equator than\nany other place in the U.S., allowing rocket\nlaunches to take advantage of the Earth\'s spin.\nAnd it is the only site in the U.S. where rockets\ncan be launched into either an equatorial or a\npolar orbit without overflying populated areas.\nTwo possible sites have been identified for\nthe spaceport-Palima Point and Kahilipali\nPoint on the Big Island- and draft environmental impact statements for each are expected this summer.\nThe commercial launch facility would\nhandle expendable launch vehicles (ELVs).\nincluding those similar in scale to the Scout\nand Delta II vehicles, and up to the commercial\nTitan III vehicle. Sub-orbital sounding rockets\nalso could be launched.\nFollowing release of the draft environmental impact statements, Hawaii will still\nhave much to accomplish. The site must be\nacquired. Funding-in the form or one or more\npartners, probably international in scope, quite\nlikely from Japan-must be achieved . And a\nlaunch facility must be built. But if all goes well,\n"an ML V could be launched from Hawaii in late\n\'93 or early \'94: Admiral Hayward said.\n\nInformationlElectronics\nHawaii designs and manufactures goods\nand services for telecommunications and\nelectronics, and sells the products all over the\nworld . With its mid-Pacific location, Hawaii is\nthe hub for telecommunication flowing from the\nU.S. mainland to Asia and the Pacific.\n"We have established Hawaii as a highspeed digital communications hub-both fiber\nand digital satellite: states Bill Martin of AT&T.\n"This means for businesses in Hawaii, service\nto the Pacific Rim is direct and less costly. Any\nplace that AT&T goes by gateway is available\nfrom Hawaii ."\nA major long distance carrier, Long Distance USA (which has since merged with\nSprint), got its start in Hawaii. SoftStyle, a\ncomputer software company which designed\nand published drivers for many major computer peripherals, began in Hawaii, and is now\na part of Phoenix Technologies. On the consumer side, Hawaii took to automatic teller\nmachines with a passion, while the mainland\n\nwas still wondering if they weren \'t just a passing fad . And the island of Kauai became the\nfirst rural service area in the U.S. for cellular\ntelephone service, when GTE Mobilnet began\nservice there in August 1989.\n\nlntelectJ.Unndversary\nIntelect, Inc., an international supplier of\nvoice and data communications equipment for\ngovernment and military systems, recently\ncelebrated its 25th anniversary by moving into\nits new, 30,000 square foot facility at the Mililani Technology Park and announcing its entry\ninto the commercial telecommunications market with its new Black Panther line of equipment.\nThe new product line begins with a digital\nvoice-data switching platform from which Intelect plans to derive a family of advanced telecommunications products. The Black Panther\nis a digital multiple parallel bus system using\npulse code modulation (PCM) time division\nswitching. Two platforms using the same\narchitecture will be available-one serving 32\nto 1024 ports and the other 32 to 2048 ports.\nTwo key points differentiate the Black\nPanther from conventional PABXs and key\nsystems : Each port card has its own microprocessor and memory, and each port has its own\ntime slot. According to the company, "EPABXs\nare designed without a full complement of time\nslots for the absolute lowest manufacturing\ncost per port. EPABXs also can\'t afford the\ndistributed processing that gives Intelect\'s\nBlack Panther its full conferencing capacity\nand ease of adaptation to special consumer\nneeds. The Black Panther line is aimed at a\nmarket that needs non-blocking , full availability traffic capacity."\n\nAutomation Leader\nVeriFone, Inc. was founded in Hawaii in\n1981 by Bill Melton to develop, manufacture,\nmarket, and support transaction terminals and\nmicrocomputer systems. In eight years the\ncompany has become the international leader\nin the transaction automation business with\n500 employees worldwide and offices\nthroughoutthe U.S., Europe, the Far East, and\nAustralia.\nThe company began in the new field of\ncredit verification terminals, which check\ncredit cards quickly and automatically. This\n\nHawaii offers the opportunity for both polar and equatorial launches of spacecraft.\nPhoto courtesy Hawaii Space Oevelopment Authority\n\nreplaced the lengthy process by which the\nclerk had to place a phone call. wait while the\nrecords were checked. and receive a verification number. Hard work and aggressive sales\nhave given the company a majority of the\nmarket. \xc2\xb7Since 1982, revenues have grown at\n110 percent a year~mpounded annually,"\naccording to Hatim A. Tyabji, president and\nCEO. The company shipped its one millionth\nsystem in September.\nA critical factor in VeriFone\'s rapid growth\nhas been the backing it received from Bank of\nHawaii. According to Robert Paris, senior vice\npresident and senior lending officer of the\nbank, "We took some risk because we saw\nsome potential there. This goes all the way\nback to when they were waiting for their first\nventure capital. We gave them a $7 million line\nof credit when they were waiting for $5 million."\nAccording to Paris, the most important\nthing was that VeriFone\'s management grew\nto keep pace with the company\'s expansion.\n"Too often people try to take their company too\nbig too fast and they crash and burn. Melton\ntook it to the point where it was starting to get\ntoo big for his expertise, and he went beyond\nHawaii to recruit the people he needed . He\nfound a financial person who had taken other\ncompanies public. And he gotthe right venture\ncapital group."\n\ncalled in Hawaiian limu-make-o-Hana or "the\ndeadly seaweed of Hana."\nAnother company, Moana Bioproducts,\nhas developed an antibody for detecting ciguaterra, a poisonous substance that contam inates fish and shellfish in coral reefs. Funded\nin part by $45,000 in state and federal SBIR\ngrants, the ciguaterra immunotoxin can be\nused by fishermen to do on-site testing. It\nchanges the pigment of a fish\'s flesh from\ncolorless to blue when the ciguaterra is present.\n\nValuable Waste\n\nFounded in 1979 by Albert D. Rich, an\napplied logician, and David R. Stoutemyer, a\nuniversity engineering professor, Soft Warehouse, Inc., has found its niche with two software products for use on IBM PCs and compatibles. muLlSP-87 is a high-performance\nLISP language pseudo-code compiler, interpreter, and programming environment for the\ndevelopment of artificial intelligence software.\nDerive, A Mathematical Assistant, is a menudriven symbolic math system which intelligently applies the rules of algebra, trigonometry, calculus, and matrix algebra to solve a\nwide variety of mathematical problems.\n"Derive lets you do symbolic math on a\nPC," said co-founder Rich. "It\'s taking the education world by storm. It\'s the way math is\ngoing to be taught in the next ten years."\nOther software developers in Hawaii include Data House, Boeing Computer, SAIC,\nand Martin Mariena.\n\nUniversal Synergetics, Inc. (Unisyn Hawaii) takes waste material that nobody wants\nand turns it into something of value. The waste\nmaterial is processed in an anaerobic digester,\nproducing a biogas that is mostly methane and\ncarbon dioxide. The methane is used as fuel to\ngenerate electricity. The carbon dioxide can\nbe routed to an algae pond where Unisyn\ngrows spirulina, which is then processed,\nfreeze-dried, and sold in more than 350 health\nfood stores on the mainland. Or C02 can be\npiped to Unisyn\'s three-and-a-half acre greenhouse to encourage plant growth. What remains in the digester is a single-cell protein\nwhich can be processed as either a feed for\nfarm animals and aquaculture, or as an organic fertilizer.\nIn its current configuration, the Unisyn\nsystem starts with manure, but James D.\nMcElvaney, vice president, biotechnology and\ndevelopment, points out that "this shouldn\'t be\nthought of as a manure process. We want to\nlook at every kind of waste treatment."\nIn February , Unisyn\'s proprietary process\nwas licensed by Ecotechniek bv, a pollution\nabatement firm located in Utrecht, the Netherlands, for use in the Netherlands, Austria,\nBelgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and West Germany. Unisyn will receive a\nlicensing fee for the technology and assistance associated with Ecotechniek\'s first\nplant, a $50 million manure processing plant\nnear Dordrecht, scheduled for completion in\n1991 .\n\'\'The Unisyn system gets rid of unwanted\nwaste and produces products which otherwise\nwould have to be imported," McElvaney said.\n"The integration of processes results in higher\nquality products at lower cost. For example,\n\nBiotechnology\n\nInstrumentation used in eddy study\n\nSoft Warehouse\n\nIn the Manoa Valley, the Natural Products\nLaboratory of the University of Hawaii is the\nsole national source of a blue-green marine\nalgae strain which is being used in research on\ncures for cancer, AIDS, herpes, and several\nviruses. The laboratory provides cultures from\n1000 blue-green algae to the National Cancer\nInstitute (NCI), which screens them for anticancer activity against various human cancer\ncell lines. NCI is looking for activity which is\nselective : Activity in marine algae that will just\nkill breast cancer cells or colon cancer cells.\nSince 1983, Hawaii Biotechnology Group,\nInc., a genetic engineering company in Aiea,\nhas received $2,311 ,697 in federal Small\nBusiness Innovative Research (SBIR) awards\n-71 percent of the total won by Hawaii companies. Hawaii Biotech\'s research includes\ndevelopment of a flightless female medfly\nwhich could provide a genetic answer to the\nfruitfly problem, and work on a vaccine against\ndengue fever. Among its other efforts is a longterm project looking at a potential cancer cure\nderived from Palythoa toxica, a seaweed\n\nPhoto courtesy Oceanic Institute\n\nbecause we were producing our own electricity on site, we were able to consider freezedrying our spirulina. Once we did that, we saw\nthat there were quality advantages. We use no\nheat to dry the spiru lina so there is no damage\nto pigment and no damage to the beta carotene. But if we hadn \'t had our own electricity,\nwe probably wou ldn\'t have tried it. \'\n\nAquaculture\nFor nearly 30 years the Oceanic Institute,\nlocated just around Makapuu Point on the\nWindward side of Oahu, has been conducting\nresearch to increase the yield of food from the\nsea. For the most part, that means developing\nthe techniques of intensive aquaculture.\nRecently, the institute has had success in\nusing hormones to get two popular food fish,\nmullet and milkfish, to spawn and grow to maturity in a high-density aquaculture environment. Other work has gone into improving\nshrimp culture, and restocking the Hawaii fishery with mullet to the benefit of Hawaii\'s sports\nfishermen . And the institute has aquaculture\nprograms running internationally from Egypt to\nIndonesia.\nAmorient Aquafarm , Inc., has been active\nin commercial aquaculture in Hawaii since\n1977, raising prawns, shrimp, and some specialized food fish at a facility in Kahuku near the\nNorth Shore of Oahu. "We are really the only\nlong-term operating shrimp farm out here,"\nstated vice president and general manager\nLyndon Burzell. "The others have come and\ngone."\nBurzell sees the market for his products as\nboth special and limited. "We got in thinking\nthe market was better than it was. The only\nreason we can make it is that we have an\nisolated market with no natural supply. People\nare willing to pay a premium for fresh shrimp\nrather than frozen shrimp-for instance for\nsushi.\n"The majority of the science is in the hatching and reproductive phases," Burzell said .\nAmorient gets about two-and-a-half crops of\nshrimp a year. "We had to manipulate the\nhormone level in the adults and trick them into\nthinking it was spring. In the wild, shrimp\nproduce a huge number of offspring with a\nminiscule survival rate. Once you crack the\nproblem , you have a superabundance of\nshrimp. With 250 males and 250 females we\nget 5-7 million babies per month."\n\nUsing OTEC Water\nOTEC research led to the investigation of\nother ways to use cold, deep ocean water\nonce it had been brought to the surface.\nTanks, ponds, and pipes cover the NELH\nlandscape, bringing the water to a series of experimental and commercial applications in\nnatural energy, aquaculture, pharmacology,\nand agriculture.\nPumped up from 2200 feet , the water is\nabout 9\xc2\xb0C and not only nutrient-rich but relatively pathogen-free. Projects operating at\nNELH include an abalone farm , a company\ngrowing microalgae for health food , a company growing Maine lobsters, a project to grow\nopihi, and several aquaculture projects raising\nfood fish , including salmon and trout.\nAquaculture Enterprises, for example,\nuses cold NELH water to test and demonstrate\nthe technology of growing the lobsters. "You\nhave to have cold water, because you can\'t\nraise lobsters in the tropics," Wilson said.\nEqually important, "the deep water is clean.\nMost places along the Continental United\n\nStates, the water is polluted." Raising the\nlobsters in this way has decreased the time it\ntakes for a lobster to mature from seven years\nin nature to about two-and-a-half years under\naquaculture conditions.\n\nMililani Technology Park,\nLeilehua Building , Suite 35,\nMililani, Hawaii 96789.\nTelephone (808) 625-5293\nFAX: (808) 625-6363\n\nOcean Farms\n\nOther Technology Parks\n\nOcean Farms Hawaii has had so much\nsuccess in aquaculture using Keahole Point\nwater that it has built three more ponds and installed four eighteen inch pipes to bring up the\nwater from below 2000 feet. Early on, Ocean\nFarms found that both the abalone and the\nkelp to feed them grow more quickly and\nsafely in Keahole water than in the natural\nconditions of the ocean off California. They\nalso have about three million salmon and ten\nmillion oysters. "The combination of salmon\nand kelp is important," said company president\nGeorge Lockwood. "The kelp absorbs the\nwaste products of the salmon and produces a\nhigh level of oxygen, which the salmon need.\nAnd the oysters eat microalgae diatoms which\notherwise would shade the kelp and retard\ngrowth."\nOcean Farms Hawaii expects to send to\nmarket this year 500,000 pounds of salmon, a\nmillion oysters, and 300,000 pounds of abalone.\n\nMililani Technology Park on Oahu is the\nhome of Intelect, Inc., VeriFone, Inc., the\nHTDC, and several other Hawaii high-tech\nbusinesses.

To obtain a high and stable\nquantum efficiency, the device must be\nbiased in a strong accumulation mode.\nThis, in turn, requires a high electric field at\nthe back surface to repel photogenerated\nelectrons and to direct those electrons\ntoward potential wells on the front surface.\n\nThe physical principle of the enhancement\nis explained more fully in "Metal Rim Increases OCD Output" (NPO-16815), NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 13, No. 4, page 24.\nIn the new treatment, the back side of a\npositively-doped silicon charged-coupled\ndevice is exposed to an atmosphere of nitric oxide, which is strongly electronegative and bonds strongly to the surface ..The\nnitric oxide adsorbed by the device forms a\nnegative charge on the back surface. This\n\ncharge repels electrons toward the front,\nas required. Devices thus treated would be\nuseful for imaging at wavelengths from Ultraviolet to blue; for example, in astronomical observations.\nThis work was done by Michael H. Hecht\nof Caltech and Edward H.

Like the surface layer of nitric\noxide described in the preceding article,\nthe iridium film would enhance the quantum efficiency according to the principle\ndiscussed in "Metal Rim Increases ceD\nOutput" (NPO-16815), NASA Tech Briefs,\nVol. 13, No.4, page 24.\nThe iridium would be deposited on a\nlayer of silicon dioxide 30 A thick on the\n\nback surface of the silicon charge-coupled\ndevice. Because iridium has a work function in the required range, this structure\nshould constitute a metallinsulatorlsemiconductor Schottky barrier, which would\nrepel photogene rated electrons to the front\nsurface, thus assuring high quantum efficiency.\nThe device described in the referenced\narticle is similar, except that its film is gold,\nnickel, or platinum. However, the platinumcoated device is sensitive to hydrogen unless oxygen is present, and the oxide in the\nplatinum-coated device deteriorates in a\n\ndry atmosphere. The new iridium film does\nnot react with hydrogen, so that the device\nneed not be kept in oxygen: This is an advantage where the high absorption of ultraviolet light by oxygen would be undesirable;\nfor example, when the device is used to\nmake astronomical observations from high\naltitudes.\nThis work was done by Michael H. Hecht\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

In its interaction with the positivelydoped bulk Si of the OCD, the silicide/oxide\nlayer would form a Schottky barrier that\nINOOId repel electrons, thus promoting the accumUlation of the photogenerated charge\ncarriers in the front-side CCD potential\nwells. The phYSical principle responsible\n26\n\nfor the improvement is explained in "Metal\nFilm Increases ceD Output" (NPO-16815),\nNASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 13, No.4, page 24.\nThe back-surface coat described in the\nnoted article is PtlSi0 2. Because of a catalytic property of Pt, this combination of materials is sensitive to hydrogen unless oxygen is present; but oxygen is unsuitable in\nastronomical, airborne, or other operations\nthat involve the detection of ultraviolet radiation, because it absorbs strongly in the Ultraviolet range. Furthermore, the oxide is\n\ndegraded by a dry atmosphere.\nBoth PtSi and IrSi have the work functions necessary to bias the ceD strongly in\nthe accumulation mode. Neither PtSi nor\nIrSi reacts with hydrogen. The degradation\nof the oxide can be corrected by use of a\nlow-temperature oxide-deposition process.\nThis work was done by Michael H.\nHecht of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propul\xc2\xb7\nslon Laboratory.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA concept for the distribution of 6(}Hz\nac power in a large building devoted to the\nassembly and testing of equipment would\nimprove safety, reduce the number of outlets and lengthy cables, and readily accommodate frequent changes in operations and configuration. According to the\nconcept, power \'M)uld be fed from floor recesses by cable to secondary distribution\ncenters in the areas (see figure). Instead of\nbeing mounted in fixed locations on the\nfloor, the power panels would be in carts\n\nand could be moved close to the equipment under test; multiple long cables on\nthe floor \'M)uld not be needed. One cart\n\'M)uld furnish 25 kVA of power.\nWhere ordinary industrial loads are to\nbe supplied, they could be connected\ndirectly to carts. For computers and other\nequipment susceptible to minor transient\nvariations in voltage, instrumentation\npower isolated from the commercial powerlines would be provided. Two sources of\npower, industrial and instrumentation,\n\nwould be available to these carts. The instrumentation power would meet tighter\nstandards to feed computers and delicate\ninstruments. The industrial-grade power\nwould be suitable for power tools and other\nhardware. Three-phase and single1)hase\noutlets \'M)uld be available from each.\nThis work was done by Robert L Mears\nof McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co.\nfor Kennedy Space Center.

The processor would be able\nto "learn" when provided with suitable c0mbinations of inputs and enforced ootputs. It\nwoold include programmable resistive memory elements (corresp:n:ling to synapses),\nthe conductances (synapse weights) of\nwhich could be adjusted during learning. It\nwoold also ooude buffer arrpIifiers, summing circuits, and sarrpIe-and-hoI circuits\narranged in layers of electronic neurons in\naccordance with the delta-back-propagation algorithm. The algorithm would be\nmodified to suppress unintended changes\n28\n\nin synapse weights caused by circuit drifts.\nIn the analog neural net\'MJrk of Figure 1,\nthe neurons are represented by summers\nand threshold-function (f) circuits connected in series. The degree to which a\ngiven "neuron" is activated depends on\nthe activation of the neurons in the preceding layer and on the conductances of the\n"synapses" leading to the neuron.\nA major consideration in the design of\nneural net\'MJrks is how to adjust the synaptic weights. In the delta-back-propagation\nscheme, the weights are adjusted (that is,\nthe network is trained) by example. For the\ntask at hand, the network is repeatedly\ntrained by applying representative input\n\nvalues and simultaneously applying the\ndesired outputs to the net\'MJrk. A backpropagation system is then used to modify\nthe weights so that the target output is\nmore likely to occur given the applied input.\nBecause the weights cannot be changed\ngreatly during a back-propagation pass\n(otherwise previously stored information\nmay be corrupted), many thousands or millions of back-propagation training passes\nmay be necessary to train such a net\'MJrk\nfully.\nThe design and use of back-propagatlon\ncircuitry is quite complicated. In one implementation, the back propagation is serially\nperformed one layer at a time.

Eight diodes are used to\nprovide isolation between the two motors.\nClock pulses are applied to both counters U4 and U5, but only the counter selected by switch SW4A is enabled to count.\nThis same switch, acting through CD4049\ninverters U2B and U2C, enables the outputs of only that counter to be gated\nthrough U5. The three-input CD4075 OR\ngate U3B with output pin 6, and inverter\nU2D with output pin 10, were incorporated\n32\n\nto prevent decoder U6 from interpreting its\ninputs as a zero during the transition time\nwhen switch SW4A is operated. This is accomplished by applying a high level to input\npin 11 of U6 during the transition time, thereby forcing the decoder to put out an eight,\nwhich is not used.\nThe source of the clock pulses for the\ntwo counters is either the single-step pushbutton, SW2, circuit, if Single-step mode\nhas been selected, or else the auto-stepping circuit, if it has been selected by\nswitch SW3. In the single-step mode, the\nmaximum width of the clock pulse is determined by the duration of closure of SW2.\nThe minimum duration is determined by\nthe values of the resistor and capacitor\nconnected to SW2.\nTo prevent unintentional auto-stepping\n\nof the motors in the auto-stepping mode,\nthe circuit has been configured to require\ndepressing switch SW2 in addition to selecting the auto-stepping mode with switch\nSW4. The repetition rate of the auto-stepping is determined by the fixed reistors,\ncapacitor, potentiometer, and length of the\ndivider chain selected.\nThe clock pulses from either circuit are\ninhibited when the motor-power switch,\nSW1, is off. This prevents advancement of\nthe counters when the motors are not able\nto track them.\nThis work was done by Roger Ratliff,\nKenneth Rehmann, and O1arles Backus of\nGoddard Space Right Center.

Light from a 25-mW Hel\nNe laser fed into optical fiber 1 travels\nthrough a fiber coupler to output fibers 2\nand 3. Rber 2 is wound tightly around piezoelectric transducer PZT2, and fiber 3 is\nwound around PZT1.The light emitted from\none of the output fibers is used as the 0bject beam for an interferometric system;\nthe light from the other output fiber creates\nthe reference beam. The output fibers are\nshown forming an interferometer for direct\ndetection of the relative phase 6, but one\nadvantage of this system is that the phase\ncontrol is independent of fiber placement,\nso that these fibers can be set in any configuration .\nSome of the light traveling through the\noutput fibers is reflected by the glass/air interface at the fiber faces and returns\nthrough the coupler, travels through optical\nfiber 4, and is detected by photodiode 1. A\n1D-kHz sinusoidal voltage applied to PZT1\nmodulates the phase of the light traveling\nthrough fiber 3, thereby modulating the\nlight detected by photodiode 1. A lock-in\namplifier multiplies the signal generated by\nphotodiode 1 by the modulation signal and\nfilters the result, producing an error voltage\nthat is proportional to sin 26. This voltage is\napplied to PZT2 to alter the optical path\nlength of fiber 2 until the error voltage is\nnUlled, stabilizing 6.\nManipulating the sign of the output of\nphotodiode 1 relative to the modulation\nsignal forces 26 to be an even or odd multiple of 180 0, so that 6 can be set to any\nmultiple of 90 0 . To produce a monotonically increasing sequence of 90 \xc2\xb0 phase steps\nfor phase-stepping interferometry, the\nphase controller is temporarily deactivated, and voltage steps are applied to PZT2\nto change the relative phase by roughly\n90\xc2\xb0. When reactivated, the controller\nquickly provides the fine tuning that is required to produce and maintain an accurate 90 \xc2\xb0 phase step.\n7h1s oork was done by Carolyn R.

This study has led to the development\nof a class of efficient parallel algorithms for\nthese problems. URRCS represents an algorithmically specialized architecture, in\nthe sense that it is capable of exploiting the\ncommon properties of this class of parallel\nalgorithms.\nPrevious proposals for parallel computation of the kinematic and dynamic problems\nhave been based on rather conventional\nparallel architectures; i.e., either MultipleInstruction/Multiple Data (MIMD)or SingleInstruction/Multiple-Data (SIMD). The\ndrawback of these proposals is that they\neither require rather complex architectures (as in most SIMD proposals) or are\ncapable of exploiting only one type of\nparallelism (mostly coarse grain parallelism as in MIMD proposals), which is not\nthe most significant parallelism and leads\nto the inefficiency in the computation. In\norder to exploit different types of parallelism at different computational levels efficiently, URRCS is designed with the\ncapability of both MIMDand SIMDtypesof\nparallel processing. In this sense, it is a\nreconfigurable parallel architecture that,\ndepending on the algorithmic requirements, can perform the computation as an\nMIMD/SIMD or SIMD/SIMD architecture.\nAnother possible configuration of the\nURRCS is MIMD/SIMD/SIMD. This is particularly suitable for inverse dynamics\ncomputation, which allows the exploitation\nof parallelism at three computational\nlevels.\nFor the purpose of interfacing to the outside world, URRCS is an attached processor that can be interfaced to the bus of an\nexternal host as part of the bus memory\n(see figure). It includes n SIMD processors\ncalled "cells" and an internal host processor, which acts as an interface with the\n36\n\nexternal host, controls the activities of the\ncells, and performs the inpuUoutput operations. Each cell is capable of exploiting fine\ngrain parallelism. Specifically, each cell\ncan perform two matrix-vector operations\nin parallel while fully exploiting parallelism\nin each operation. The cells\' architecture is\noptimized for the size of matrices and vectors involved in the computation. However,\n\ndue to the architectural flexibility, paral\xc2\xb7\nlelism can also be efficiently explOited in\noperations with matrices and vectors of\nlarger size or in purely scalar operations.\nThe cells are interconnected through a\nring structure, which enables a rapid com\xc2\xb7\nmunication between adjacent cells as well\nas the reliable distribution of the global\nclock signal among the cells.

The fast and synchronous communication among the cells reduces the overhead caused by message\npassing. The basic synchronization mechanism of the architecture is data-driven,\nwhich, similar to the wave front array processors, provides local synchronization\namong the cells. However, because all the\ncells are driven with the same global clock\nand because of the regularity of the computations, global clock-based synchronization similar to the systolic arrays can also\nbe used.\nThe internal host controls the activities\nof the system by interpreting the instructions sent by the external host. The instruc-\n\ntions are decomposed into a series of computationS to be performed by the cells. For\nthe internal host, the cells are considered\nas memory units that are connected to its\nmemory bus and can be accessed randomly. Depending on the required computation, the internal host distributes the data\namong the cells and initiates their actMties\nby procedure calls. The actMties of the\ncells are then carried out independently\nfrom the internal host. The end of the computation is indicated by the cells to the internal host, which then transforms the results to the external host.\nURRCS represents a successful approach to the design of algorithmically\nspecialized parallel architectures in which\nthe algorithmic study has resulted in the\npractical implementation of a low-cost and\nhigh-performance architecture for a class\n\nof problems. For a six-degree-of-freedom\ngeneral robot manipulator (with no 0ptimization), the computation time of the inverse dynamics problem, using the Newton-Euler formulation, has been measured\nas 187 JAS, and that of the forward kinematics plus Jacobian as 75 JAS.\nThis work was done by Amir Fijanyand\nAntal K Bejczy of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA remote maintenance monitoring system Is being developed to diagnose protr\nlems In a large distributed computer network. The network consists of data links,\ndisplays, controls, software, and more than\n200 computers. The computers, the average age of which is more than 10 years,\nhave no built-in self-testing ability. The monitoring system uses sensors to collect data\non failures and an expert system to examine the data, diagnose the causes of\nfailures, and recommend cures.\nThe monitoring system was designed to\nbe retrofitted into the launch processing\nsystem at Kennedy Space Center, which\nwill not be replaced for several years. In the\ninterim, the system will reduce downtime\nand lower the workload and expense of\nmaintenance. It will also make the network\nless dependent on human expertise, which\nis becoming increasingly scarce.\nThe system is based on integrated diagnostics, a systems engineering approach In which all elements that affect\nmaintenance are combined. These ele-\n\nments include built -in testing, maintenance\naids, management tools, training, artificial\nIntelligence, logistics support, data bases,\nand automatic test equipment. Ideally, Integrated diagnostics should be included in\nthe design of a network. Retrofitting integrated diagnostics into an existing network\nshould nevertheless improve maintenance\nsignificantly.\nHardware monitors are implanted in the\ncomputers of the network. The monitors\ncapture memory-dump data, back-trace\ninstructions and addresses from the central processing unit, monitor regulated voltages, and record a variety of signals. In effect, the monitors integrate and automate\nthe data-collection activities of maintenance personnel.\nA UNIX-based workstation is used as a\ndata manager. All of the data captured by\nthe hardware monitors is transfered to and\ncataloged by the data manager. The information is then provided 10 various applications for display and analysis. A real-time\ncoprocessor within the data manager moni-\n\ntors system message traffic and captures\nall relevant information. The message data\nallows a configuration status of the system\nto be maintained.\nAn expert system uses the monitor data\nto create probable failure scenarios and to\ndetermine the most likely cause of such\nthings as memory parity errors and power-supply anomalies. The expert system\nemploys knowledge acquired from maintenance personnel; the knowledge base\nexplicitly defines the reasoning process\nused in diagnosis. Because maintenance\npersonnel apply a mixture of heuristics and\ncausal modeling to diagnose failures, the\nexpert system is both rule-based and\nmodel-based.\nThis work was done by Richard C.\nOwens and Lorenz Simkins of Kennedy\nSpace Center and Donn Rochette of\nGrumman Technical Services.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn electronic memory system of 32-bit\nwords corrects bit errors caused by some\ncommon types of failures - even the\nfailure of an entire 4-bit-wide random-access-memory (RAM) chip (one of eight\nsuch chips in the system). Furthermore,\nthe system detects the failure of two such\nchips, so that the user can at least be\nwarned that the output of the memory may\ncontain errors.\n38\n\nCircuits to detect and correct errors are\nusually included in the memory subsystems of computers designed for high reliability. By use of Hamming encoding, a\nvariety of commercially available circuits\ncorrect single-bit errors and detect (but do\nnot correct) double-bit errors. Where the\nnumber of erroneous bits exceeds two,\nsuch a circuit may fail to detect the errors\nor may erroneously alter the erroneous\n\ndata in the attempt to correct them.\nWhere low power, compactness, and\nhigh performance are required in computer memories, 4-bit-wide dynamic\nRAM\'s (DRAM\'s) are usually the best\nchoice. However, common types of failures In such a DRAM can cause errors in\none, two, three, or all four bits. To overcome this disadvantage, the new 32-bitwide memory includes eight 4-bit-wide\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1990\n\n.....

The system , called BETUS for\nBarcode Equipment Tracking and Utilization System, maintains a data base on\nwhat items have been borrowed, who is\nusing them and where, and when they\nhave been calibrated. BETUS also keeps\nrecords on tools and small electronic components.\nEach item holds an aluminum tag containing a unique six-character bar code.\nEach coded tag represents a record in the\nBETUS data base:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 part number,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 serial number,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 manufacturer,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 description ,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 date due for calibration,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 calibration-cycle time,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 malfunctions,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 number of times and total number of days\nthe item has been checked out by technicians,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 number of times and total number of days\nthe item has been in the calibration laboratory, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 the supply area wherein the item resides\nor the name of the person who has\nchecked it out.\n42\n\nTechnicians and engineers who draw\nequipment from supply areas have their\nown bar-coded user cards, small enough\nto fit in wallets or on identification cards.\nEach card bears a three-digit number that\nis cross-referenced in the data base to the\nuser\'s name, mail stop, and telephone\nnumber.\nBETUS currently includes five terminals\n(see figure). Asynchronous modems, operating at 9,600 baud, connect the terminals\nto a host microcomputer. The host software is a multiuser, menu{jriven database-management package.\nBar-Code\n\nTh e Host Microcomp uter serves\nterminal areas 5\nand 6mi (8 and\n10km) distant. It\nalso serves a terminal that generates reports and\nmaintains the data\nbase , one that\ndetermines the\nstat uses of small\nparts, and one used\nto develop software.\n\nWhen a user checks out an item at a\nsupply area, the supply clerk selects the\ncheck-in/checkout menu from the main\nmenu and passes a bar -code wand over\nthe equipment tag , the user\'s card, and the\nbar code on the checkout menu for the\nlocation to which the item will be taken. The\ninformation is fed to the data base, with the\ntime of the transaction, as it is entered.\nWhen the item is subsequently checked\nback in, BETUS calculates the time during\nwhich it was in use.\nBETUS prints daily activity reports that\nshow the number of times equipment has\nbeen checked out to technicians or for\nAdmin istration\n(Reports.

The\nunderlying concept of the device is applicable to magnetiC or optical disks,\nAs shown in Figure 1, the device includes two reading/writing heads, one on\neach of two disks. (Alternatively, two heads\non opposite sides of one disk could be\nused.) The data are recorded in concentric\ntracks on the disk. The tracks on one disk\nare numbered starting with track 1 near\nthe outer edge, while the tracks on the\nouter disk are numbered starting with track\n1 at the inner edge of the recording area.\nThe combined lengths of the two tracks\ndesignated by the given number is constant, equal to the combined length of two\ntracks designated by any other number. If\nthe data are recorded on all tracks at the\nsame high density (number of bits per unit\nlength of traCk), then the recording area is\nutilized fully, and the combined capacity of\n\nWhen a user checks\nsupply area, the supply\ncheck-in/checkout men I\nmenu and passes a bar\nthe equipment tag, the USI\nbar code on the checkc\n~ation to which the item \'\nI~formation is fed to the de\ntIme of the transaction, \'\nWhen the item is subsec\nback in, SETUS calculate\'\nwhich it was in use.\n\'\nBEWS prints daily act;\nshow the number of times\nbeen checked out to tee\n\nevery numbered pair of tracks is a constant.\nTo simplify control and access, the disks\nare turned at constant speed. This means\nthat the data rate in each reading/writing\nhead is proportional to the radius of its\ntrack, and the sum of the data rates in the\ntwo heads positioned on any numbered\npair of tracks is a constant.\nAs shown in Figure 2, data to be recorded are first fed into a buffer. A master\noscillator and programmable frequency\nsynthesizers generate clock signals at the\nappropriate data rates, and these clock\nsignals are used to transfer the data from\nthe buffer to the recording circuits at the\nrates appropriate for the two tracks in use.\nDuring readout, data from the two reading\ncircuits are fed into the buffer. With the help\nof either timing signals interspersed with\nthe data or clock signals from the master\noscillator, the buffer reassembles the data\nfrom the tracks into an output signal containing the sequence of data recorded previously. Since each numbered pair of\n\nReadlngl\nWriting\nHead A\n\ntracks contains the same constant number\nof bits, the data rate is also a constant.\nIf the number of tracks on each disk is\nlarge, the circuitry necessary to generate\nthe correspondingly large number of recording and playback frequencies can be\nexcessively complicated. In that case, it is\nmore practical to group convenient numbers of adjacent tracks together and use\nthe same data rate on all tracks within\neach group on a disk, For example, on a\npair of disks with 100 tracks each, tracks\ncould be arranged in groups of 10, with a\ncombined data rate of 2.9 Mb/s on each\nnumbered pair of tracks. In this example,\ntracks 91 through 100 would have a data\nrate of 1.0 Mbls on disk A and 1.9 Mb/s on\ndisk S. On a disk on which the outermost\ntrack has twice the radius of the innermost\ntrack, this arrangement yields a data rate\n95 percent of the ideal rate and utilizes the\nrecording area at 95.5 percent of the ideal\nutilization.\nThis work was done by Ronald M.

After all the input elements in a\nframe have been so processed, the 8 most\nsignificant bits of each output picture element are dumped to an output memory,\nand the accumulator memory begins to\naccumulate the next frame. An output se-\n\nquencer feeds the contents of the output\nmemory to a digital system for further processing or to a digital-to-analog converter\nfor display as the output image.\nFor simplicity, the figure does not include the subimage processor, which is a\nsubsystem that performs a partly one-tomany mapping. The subimage processor\nsynthesizes picture elements in the input\nimage that lie between the actual elements; this is necessary in regions where\nthe transformed coordinate grid becomes\nso fine that it requires picture-element\nspacings smaller than those of the input\nimage. The subimage processor operates\non 4- by 4-element patches of the input image, performing a combined interpolation\nof up to cubic order and remapping via an\nalgorithm distinct from that of the many-toone processor. The many-to-one and subimage processors operate in parallel on\neach frame of data, and the outputs of both\n\nare processed into one composite image.\nThe principal advantages of the new\nsystem include the antialiasing effect of the\nmany-tex>ne data path and the speed of\nlookup-table operation. Furthermore, the\nlookup tables can be reprogrammed easily\nwith the help of a computer that generates\nthe table values from a mathematical description of the desired transformation.\nThis work was done by Richard D.

The extra degrees of freedom\ncan be used to perform a simultaneous\nsubtask (for example, to avoid obstacles or\nto keep jOint angles within ranges that maximize manipulability). The new control\nscheme is adaptive and is based on the observed performance of the manipulator. It\ninvolves neither a complicated mathematical model of the dynamics of the manipulator nor a time-consuming inverse kinematic transformation.\nIn a system of n degrees of freedom, the\n48\n\npoSition and orientation of the end effector\nare represented by an m-dimensional coordinate vector Y. while the kinematic functions are represented by the (-dimensional\nvector where r + m n. The redundancy\ncan be utilized by placing kinematic equality constraints on to specify the subtask.\nThen the task and subtask vectors can be\ncombined to obtain X = (P, the augmented n-dimensional vector, which increases the apparent dimension of the\ntask space from m to n. In this formulation,\nthe configuration of the manipulator is fully\nspecified and is not redundant.\nThe velocities of the manipulator are related via\nX (t) = J(8)B(t)\nwhere t = time, 8 represents the joint angles, and\n\n+\n,\n\n=\n\n+\n\nis the n x n augmented Jacobian matrix.\nThe m xn submatrix J e(8) is associated\nwith the end effector, while the (X n submatrix Jc(8) is related to the kinematic functions. The two submatrices Je and Jc combine to form the square augmented Jacobian matrixJ.\nThe problem is to devise a scheme that\nmakes X(t) track the desired trajectory\nXJ.t) as closely as possible. In the control\nscheme shown in Figure 1, the actual endeffector coordinates Y(t) and the current\nvalues +(t) of the kinematic functions are\ncomputed and fed back to the controller.\nThe controller uses this feedback information together with the commanded end-efNASA Tech Briefs, June 1990\n\nMATLABTM\nHigh-Performance\nNumeric Computation\nand Data Analysis\n\nM\n\n"MATLAB is\nthe undisputed\nchoice for\ncomputationintensive\nengineering\nwork."\n\nATLAB has rapidly become an\n\nindustry standard for engineering and scientific research.

To test this\nsystem, a compact analyzer/controller has\nbeen developed, built, and tested in a\nsmall-scale wind tunnel that is a prototype\nof the 8/ HTT.\nThe atmosphere in the system is sampled through a specially designed probe\nand transported to a platinum-coated zirconia cell kept at a temperature of 800 \xc2\xb0c.\nThis cell produces a voltage proportional to\nthe difference between the 02 contents of\nthe gases on the two faces of the cell. Air is\nused as the reference gas.\nThe sampling probe is cooled, thus cooling the sample gas and necessitating an inline heater to bring the sample back up to\n300 to 800 \xc2\xb0C to improve the response of\nthe sensor. In addition, a compressor is\n50\n\nused to increase the flow of the sample to\nabout 6,000 to 8,000 cm 3/min and to raise\nsimultaneously the pressure of the gas\nsample. A vent to the atmosphere is provid\xc2\xb7\ned to ensure that the sample is at atmospheric pressure when it arrives at the face\nof the cell. This arrangement keeps the\npressure constant across the zirconia cell\nand allows the use of relatively simple\nequations to calculate the O2 content of\nthe sample gas.\nThe result of a typical run is shown in the\nupper right portion of the figure. \'Nhen the\nwind tunnel is started with air, the continuous-immersion probe displays the 20.95percent 02 content of air. The accuracy of\nthe readout is about to percent. The sensor reading is updated every 0.2 second,\nmaking the system capable of essentially\nreal-time control of the liquid-oxygen valve.\nThe response time of the detector is only\nabout 30 ms, but the total response time of\n\nthe system is about 200 ms, achievable\nwith short lengths of the probe-to-detector\nline.\nWhen combustion is established, the 02\ncontent drops rapidly to 5 percent or less.\nThe system is brought to a stable total\npressure and temperature, with typical\nvalues of 800 to 2,000 psia (5.5 to 14 MPa\nabsolute) and 3,000 to 3,500 OR (1,700 to\n1,000 K), respectively. The system for the\naddition and control of liquid oxygen is then\nbrought on-line, and the 02 content rapidly\nrises. The addition of liquid oxygen is controlled manually and then switched to the\nautomatic preset or closed-loop control to\nbring the 02 content to the desired level of\n20.95 percent, simulating air.\nThe control of the system is remarkably\nstable, with very little overshoot, thus minimizing the time required before the engine\ncould be inserted in the test medium.

This is an important topic because all physical systems are\ndistributed, and therefore, complete representations would require, in principle, infinite numbers of degrees of freedom.These\nconsiderations are particularly relevant to\nsystems for the active control (e.g., the\nsuppression of vibrations) of large, flexible\nstructures.\nThe goal of this study is to find a methodology for the design of model-reference\nadaptive controls for systems of both finite\nand infinite numbers of dimensions, of both\nsingle-inputlsingle-output and multiple-input/multiple-output, and in which the\nNASA Tec h Briefs, Ju ne 1990\n\norders of the plants to be controlled are unknown. The approach involves a generalization of the command-generator tracker\n(001) theory. The appeal of this method is\nthat it does not require the reference\nmodel to be of the same order as that of the\nplant, and the knowledge of order of the\nplant is not needed. In fact, state space\nmay even have an infinite number of dimensions. However, alternative assumptions are needed to ensure closed-loop stability.\nThis method is naturally suitable for application to high-order systems inasmuch\nas its main emphasis is on the adjustment\nof a low-orderfeedback-gain matrix.The disadvantage is that instead of the dimensionality requirement, there are other conditions\nto be satisfied. While the generalization of\nthe CGT technique to the infinite-dimensional systems is not straightforward, it is\nvery promising. The three principal obstacles to the generalization are the following: (1) the solution of the Lyapunov equation may not be coercive, (2) the invariance\nprinciple cannot be applied immediately,\nand (3) strict positive realness is never attainable without positive feedthrough .\nA previous modification of the adaptive\ncontrol law of the finite-dimensional controller partially overcame these obstacles.\nIn exchange, only the Lagrange stability of\nthe error signal has been shown. This\npaper suggests a further modification, in\n\nwhich the error signal is shown to be driven\nto a residue set asymptotically.\nIt is shown that if there exists an output\nfeedback in the further-modified controller\nsuch that the closed-loop system is close\nto positive realness On the sense that there\nexists a small fictitious feedforward that\nmakes the closed-loop system positive\nreal), then Lagrange stability is assured.\nThis is an improvement in that stability is\nachieved in the original space and asymptotic stability is maintained for the finitedimensional case O ,the modification is a\n.e.\ntrue generalization and the performance in\nthe finite-dimensional case is not compromised). As an additional bonus, Lagrange\nstability is preserved under a variety of perturbations; e.g., singular and regular perturbations, bounded state and output\nnoises, and the perturbation of the modelmatching condition (the OOT condition).\nThe example of a simple damped beam\nis presented to illustrate the techniques.\nThe nominal , the sensor-actuator-mis\xc2\xb7\naligned, and the noise-disturbance cases\nare simulated to show that behavior of the\nclosed-loop system agrees with the theory.\nThis work was done by John ring-Yung\nWen of Caftech and Mark J.

These and other compounds that\nhave large nonlinear optical properties\nmay eventually find use in electro-optical\nmodulators, switches, and signal-processing equipment.\nThe new organic salts have the general formula R(CH CH)n - (p - C 5H4N CH~ +X - , where R can be one of a variety\nof organic electron{jooor moieties; n = 1,\n2, or 3; and X can be, for example,\nCF~j", BF PF6", p-CH 3 -C6H 4\ni,\nSOj",\nCH 3S0 4 , or HSOi.

The\ncompact, lightweight, low-power instrument was developed for use on a high-alti60\n\ntude research airplane.\nThe instrument shines ultraviolet light at\na wavelength of 253.7 nm from a mercury\nlamp through a sample of air in a chamber\n(see figure). The light impinges on a vacu-\n\num phototube (the sample detector), the\nelectrical output of which decreases with\nincreasing concentration of ozone and the\nconsequent increases in absorption of the\nultraviolet light in the sample. An electrometer circuit processes the output of the\nphototube.\nAir flO\'vVs into the instrument from a\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1990\n\nprobe on the outside of the airplane. An inlet valve admits the air once the airplane\nhas attained an altitude of 1,500 m, where\nthere is little chance of ingestion of airborne debris. A transfer valve switches the\nairflow alternately between the measurement chamber and a scrubber chamber in\nwhich manganese dioxide removes ozone\nfrom the air. Scrubbed and ozone-laden\nsamples thus enter the chamber alternately. The instrument uses the scrubbed samples to compensate for variations in constituents other than ozone.\nA beam splitter diverts parts of the ultraviolet beam as it leaves the mercury lamp.\nA second vacuum phototube (the reference detector) measures the diverted\nbeam, which does not pass through the\nsample chamber. The output of this phototube is used to compensate for variations\nin the intensity of light emitted by the lamp.\nBoth phototubes are "solar blind" devices.\nThey do not respond to visible radiation, but\nonly to a narrow wavelength band between\n160 and 320 nm. There is therefore no\nneed for extensive filtering of external light.\nA microprocessor controls timing and\nthe acquisition of data. A random-access\nmemory backed by a battery stores data\non the transmission of ultraviolet through\nthe samples, on temperature, on pressure,\nand on navigation of the airplane. An experiment can last as long as 8 hours. When\nthe airplane lands, the data are transferred\nto a portable computer.\nA single{)oard computer in the instrument simultaneously calculates the concentration of ozone in real time (but with\nless resolution).

The laboratory would be used for research in such\ndelicate phenomena as the A transition in\nhelium, the growth of crystals, and the formation of alloys that would separate into\ntheir constituents before solidification if\ngravitation (G) were present.\nThe laboratory would consist of two\nparts: an outer part (the spacecraft) and a\nseparable inner free-floating part that\nwould house the experimental apparatus.\nDuring launch and insertion into orbit\naround the Earth, an arresting mechanism\nwould hold the inner part rigidly within the\nouter part. Once in orbit, the spacecraft\nwould be oriented with its main axis along\nthe orbital velocity. The arresting mechanism would be deactivated to allow the inner part to float freely within the outer part.\nAs long as the inner part remained near\nthe center of gravity and did not strike the\nouter part, the former would be subjected\nonly to the gravitation that governs the orbit\nand would be protected against disturbances caused by spacecraft thrusters, vibrations, rotations of the spacecraft, atmospheric drag and the like. To keep the\ngravity gradient forces also small , the\nlargest dimension of the experiment has to\nbe aligned along the flight path (See von\nBun et ai, Acta Astron. vol.

It\ndescribes the instrumentation and procedures used and demonstrates that the\ncalibration accuracy achieved exceeds\nthe design requirements. The AVIRIS was\ndeveloped for use in remote-sensing\nstudies in such disciplines as botany,\ngeology, hydrology, and oceanography.\nThe AVIRIS includes four spectrometers, the spectral ranges of which overlap\nslightly, to acquire images in contiguous\n1().nm spectral bands at wavelengths from\n0.4 to 2.45!4Tl. Flown at an altitude of 20\nkm, the instrument scans through an angle\nof 30\xc2\xb0 to cover a swath 10.5 km wide on\nthe ground. After processing, each scan\nline of the image contains 550 picture elements, each representing a surface area\napproximately 20 m across.\nOptical fibers connect the foreoptics to\nthe spectrometers. The first spectrometer\nhas a 32-element line array of silicon\ndetectors and covers the spectral range\n0.4 to 0.71 !Jm. The remaining spectrometers cover the ranges 0.68 to 1.28,\n1.24 to 1.86, and 1.83 to 2.45 !4Tl; each has\na 64-element line array of indium antimonide detectors.\nThe spectral calibration determined the\nwavelength distribution of light falling on\neach detector element to an accuracy\n\nwithin 2.1 nm, which is less than the 5-nm\nmaximum allowable by design. The paper\ndescribes the steps required: calibrating a\nlaboratory monochromator, aligning the\nmonochromator with the AVIRIS, and recording the scan of a narrow spectral\nbandwidth of light from the monochromator across the AVIRIS detectors. Also included are a diagram of the laboratory apparatus and a graph showing the spectral\nresponse determined for one of the detector elements. A tabi lists the following\nspectral calibration parameters for each\nspectrometer: average bandwidth, spectral sampling interval per detector element,\nstandard deviation of the linearity measurement, the uncertainty in the calibration\nof the monochromator, and the accuracy\nof the spectral calibration.\nThe radiometric calibration achieved an\nabsolute accuracy of 7.3 percent (traceable to a National Bureau of Standards\nlamp), which is within the 10-percent design requirement. The steps described are\nthe following: calibration of a spectroradiometer; calibration of the AVIRIS radiance\nsource, an integrating sphere 40 in. (1 m) in\ndiameter, with the spectroradiometer; acquisition of digital readings of the output of\nthe integrating sphere from the AVIRIS\ndetectors; and, finally, the calculation of a\ntable of multipliers used to convert raw\ndetector readings directly to radiance. A\ndiagram shows the apparatus used in calibrating the spectroradiometer and integrating sphere.\nThe paper includes an error-budget\nanalysis of the accuracy of the radiometric\ncalibration , which takes into account the\nfollowing: the accuracy of calibration of the\nintegrating sphere, the temporal stability of\nthe AVI RIS, the radiometric effect of uncertainty in the spectral calibration, sensitivity\nto polarization, and the effect of spectral\nand spatial stray light. Instrumental effects\nthat limit temporal stability include thermally induced drift and vibrationally induced\nfluctuations in output levels.\nFuture plans for improving the stability\nand calibration accuracy of AVIRIS include\nthe following: realignment of the foreoptics\nto eliminate vignetting, substitution of preamplifier and clock-driver circuit boards\nless vulnerable to vibration, reconfiguralion of the spectrometer heaters, installation of kinematic mounts to reduce the\ntransmission of vibration to the instrument\nand of heat from the instrument, and improvements in the built-in calibrator.\nThis work was done by G.

Some of the desired\nproperties for this material are significantly\nincreased toughness , increased resistance to microcracking, good processability, and good mechanical performance. A\nnew approach to the production of this material involves the simultaneous synthesis\nof a semi-interpenetrating network (semiIPN) polyimide, consisting of an easy-toprocess but brittle thermosetting polyimide\nand a tough but difficult-to-process thermoplastiC poIyimide. The synthesis is illustrated\nschematically in the figure.\nUnlike previous sequential syntheses,\nthe "simultaneous method" involves a\nprocess in which one polymer is crosslinked in the immediate presence of the\nother, undergoing simultaneous linear\nchain extension. This synthesis can lead to\na network in which one polymer interlocks\nwith the other, forming permanent entanglements in certain regions of the network\nsystem. The resulting physical crosslinking\ncan provide synergistic properties that are\nnonadditive and are greatly improved over\nthe properties of the constituents.\nThe new material, LaRC-RP40, was synthesized from the current leading commercially available high-temperature thermosetting imide prepolymer (chosen\nprimarily because of its easy processability\nand relative low cost compared to those of\nother high-temperature materials) and\nfrom a leading thermoplastic monomer\n(selected because of its outstanding thermo-oxidative stability, toughness, and resistance to microcracking).\nThe physical and mechanical properties\nof the neat LaRC-RP40 resin and of a graphrte-fiber-reinforced composite made with it\nwere compared wrth those of the commercially available resin used under identical\nconditions.

The development of LaRCRP40 has also demonstrated that simultaneous improvements in both toughness\ncharacteristics and glass-transition tem-\n\nperature, which are very difficult to achieve\nby conventional polymer syntheses, are\ntechnically feasible and are an attractive\nfeature of the current semi-IPN syntheSiS.\nThis work was done by Ruth H.

The thin metal-foil\nbarrier is necessary to prevent such fuels as\nliquid hydrogen and liquid methane from\ngradually oozing through the wall of the\ntank. HOINever, when the tank is filled, the\ntemperature inside drops well below room\ntemperature, causing the foil to contract\nwhile the graphite/epoxy composite shrinks\nvery little. As a result, the foil tends to pull\naway from the composite wall.\nThe tank would be made of an outer layer of graphitelepoxy plies to which double\nlayers of foil and a single layer of the liner\nwould be attached by adhesive films (see\nfigure). The sheets of foil would be placed\non the inside of the tank. The edges of the\nsheets of foil would be resistance-welded\nto form leakproof seams.\n\nGraphite/Epoxy Laminate\nWall of Tank"""\n\nThe new liner would consist of epoxy\ncontaining fibers of Spectra 1000 (or\nequivalent), a high-strength, high-modulus\nmaterial that expands with decreases of\ntemperature in the temperature range in\nwhich the tank is to be used. However, in\nthe same temperature range, the graphitelepoxy composite wall neither expands\nnor contracts significantly. As the temperature decreased in a tank of circular cross\nsection, the liner would therefore compress the foil against the wall, preventing it\nfrom pulling away. Possible choices for the\nfoil material include stainless steel, titanium, aluminum, copper, or bronze.\nBecause the liner would have to create\na hoop stress in the foil, the thickness of the\nliner would have to be chosen in consideration of the tension properties of the foil yield stress, ultimate stress, elongation,\nand modulus of elasticity. However, be-\n\nOuter Surface\nof Tank"",\n\ndh\nA\n\n.\neSlve\n\ncause the foil would be relatively thin, the\nliner could also be made thin in comparison with the wall.\nThe lined composite tank could be used\nto hold liquids from room temperature to\ncryogenic temperatures.

Recent research has been directed toward the synthesis of polyimides\nthat are soluble in common organic solvents, melt-processable, and thermally\ncurable without the evolution of volatile byproducts. Melt-processability can be enhanced by lowering the flow temperature\nvia synthesis by such techniques as the incorporation of aryl ether and meta-phenytene linkages in the backbone of a polymer.\nA previous approach to obtaining phenylated polyimides involved the Diels-A1der\npolymerization of phenylated biscyc\\opentadienones with bismaleimides. One disadvantage of this process is that during the\nreaction, carbon monoxide is produced\nafter the Diels-A1der addition. Furthermore,\nat temperatures >300 \xc2\xb0C, dehydrogena66\n\ntion and other decomposition processes\noccur, yielding polymers of poor solubility.\nConsequently, research was conducted to\nprepare, by Diels-A1der polymerization,\nhigh-temperature polymeriC materials that\nwill maintain their integrities and toughnesses during long exposure times at elevated temperatures.\nA unique monomer, N-phenyl-3,4-dimethylene-pyrrolidine can be modified to\nform a bis(exocyclodiene) (compound I in\nthe figure) for the preparation of polyimides\nby the Diels-A1der process. This bis(exocyclodiene) undergoes Diels-A1der reaction with a bismaleimide (compound 1\\ in\nthe figure) without the evolution of gaseous\nbyproducts. Dimerization, which can result\nfrom a Diels-A1der reaction between two\nexocyclic dienes, was observed in the\nDlels-Alder Polymerization yields compounds that maintain their integrities and\ntoughnesses during long exposure times at\nhigh temperatures.\n\n~--------~y----------~\nCompound I\n\no\n\n0\n\n~\n\nII\n\no\n\n0\n\n~N-\xc2\xa9-X-\xc2\xa9-N~\n\n~--------~yr---------J\n\nCompound II\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

However, it was observed that bis\n[4~3,4<fimethylene-pfrrolidyl}fj1enyl] methane reacts very rapidly with bismaleimide\nby Diels-Alder addition. This polymerization\nwas followed by 1H nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) spectroscopy. At a temperature of 50 \xc2\xb0C in trifluoroacetic acid,\ncomplete polymerization could be achieved\nwithin 48 hours. The polymerization yield\nwas estimated to be 92 percent, based on\nthe integration of the 1H NMR spectrum.\nA polymer powder was prepared from\nthe prepolymer solution, which contained\nequimolar amounts of bis[4~3,4-<limethyl\xc2\xad\nene-pyrrolidyl)-phenyl] methane (as compound I) and bismaleimide (as compound\nII) in solution. Good, flexible films were\nprepared by casting the prepolymer solu-\n\ntion onto a clean glass surface. However,\nthe original polymer film was insoluble in\norganiC solvents.\nThe thermal stability and decomposition\ntemperature of the polymer films were\nanalyzed by thermogravimetric analYSis\n(TGA). The measurements were carried\nout in nitrogen and in air, respectively. In nitrogen , the polymer film was thermally\nstable, with only 10 percent weight loss at\n357\xc2\xb0C and 20 percent weight loss at\n413 OC. On the other hand, TGA plots in air\nshowed different behavior. The first moderate weight loss occurred at a much lower\ntemperature, 239\xc2\xb0C. The second rapid\nweight loss occurred above 400 \xc2\xb0C and\nwas indicative of total decomposition of the\npolymer backbone.\nHigh-temperature polymers can be syn-\n\nthesized by use of this technique. Rims\nand perhaps fibers can be fabricated from\nthe prepolymer in solution.

The calculation of the mass\nproperties of structures of this type can be\ntedious and repetitive, but ACfOMP helps\nautomate the calculations. A structure can\nbe mathematically modeled in AutoCAD or\na COf1\'1I:Bti:>le computer-aided design (CAD)\nsystem in minutes by use of the thr~i\xc2\xad\nmensional elements. The resulting model\nprovides all the geometric data necessary\nto calculate the mass properties of the\nstructure.\nACTOMP reads the geometric data of a\ndrawing from the Drawing Interchange\nFile (DXF) used in AutoCAD. The geometric entities recognized by ACTOMP include POINTs, 3DLlNEs, and 3D FACEs.\nACTOMP requests mass, linear density, or\narea density of the elements for each layer,\nsums all the elements, and calculates the\ntotal mass, the center of mass (CM), and\nthe mass moments of inertia (MOl).\nAutoCAD uses layers to define separate\ndrawing planes. ACTOMP uses layers to\ndifferentiate between multiple types of\nsimilar elements. For example, if a structure is made of various types of beams,\nmodeled as 3DLI NEs, each w~h a different\nlinear denSity, the beams can be grouped\nby linear density, and each group placed on\na separate layer. The program requests the\nmass information of 3DLlNEs for each\nnEl\'-N layer ~ finds as it processes the drawing information. The same is true with\nPOINTs and 3DFACEs.\nBy using layers this way, a very complex\nmodel can be created. POINTs are used\nfor point masses like bolts, small machine\nNASA Tec h Bri efs, June 1990\n\nPart No.\n94 - Stress Analysis\n100 - StresS+Dynamics\n\n-SPrice\n\n\xc2\xb73HPrice\n\n$ 889\n\n$ 1290\n\n$ 1290\n\n$ 1689\n\nOther packages available:\n\nSeparate CAD package not needed.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Random Vibration Analysis\n\nNo artificial node or element limits.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Composite Element Analysis\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Buckling Analysis for Beam and\nPlate/Shell Elements\n\n101 - Heat Transfer\n\n$ 1090\n\n$ 1489\n\n102 - 100+101\n\n$1690\n\n$ 2089\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dynamic Analysis with Load Stiffening\n\n106 - Transient H.T:\n\n$ 300\n\n$ 495\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Nonlinear Gap AnalysiS\n\n110 - AccuPak Nonlinear\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\n\n$ 895\n\n$1295\n\n109 - ElectroStat\n\n$ 995\n\n3102 - FEA Demo\n\n$29\n\n3106 - ElectroStat Demo\n\n$19\n\n150D - PipePlus Demo\n\n$ 19\n\n3101 - Algor Catalog\n\nNlC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Adds to part 101 or 102.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 "\xc2\xb73H" version not necessary.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Adds to part 100 or 102.

This program is designed to support flight-dynamics research and analysis activities\nconcerning software models, algorithms,\nand techniques used within the flight Dynamics Division at the Goddard Space\nFlight Center.\nThe purpose of FDAS is to assist analysts and programmers in building, testing,\nand evaluating applications software by\nproviding an integrated support system for\nthe modification and reconfiguration of\nsoftware. This includes the capability of assembling reusable software components\ninto applications programs, as well as the\ncapability of reconfiguring an assembled\nprogram after it has been partially or fully\ncompleted.\nThe stand-alone FDAS system-manager\nutility program creates, deletes, and maintains the user-information data base, and\ncreates andlor sets up directory data\nbases for each new user. A directory data\nbase contains a user\'s application-software components and program "trees"\nconstructed from these components.\nThe installation utility program enables\napplication programmers to install their\ndeveloped Ada software components into\ntheir directory data bases under FDAS,\nthus making their code available to others\nworking on the project. Upon invocation of\nthe utility, the identity of a given user is\nvalidated against the information contained in the user-information data base.\nThe FDAS executive system program\nprovides analysts and programmers with\nthe ability to configure, test, and reconfigure program trees of their applicationsoftware components through the use of a\nwindow-based interface. This interface\nuses the user-information data base to\nvalidate the identities of users and to gain\naccess to the application-software data\nbases.\nIt is anticipated that all of the software\nplaced in the central FDAS library will be\nwritten in Ada. However, individual users\nwill have the option of importing modified\nFORTRAN software via the Ada "import"\npragma.\nFuture developments of FDAS are\nplanned to combine the system-manager\nand installation utility functions into the executive program as well as provide access\nto the VAA Ada compiler and editors.\nThe system is developed in Ada for use\non a DEC VAA computer operating under\nVMS 4.3 or higher and version 1.3 or higher\nof the VAA Ada Compilation System (ACS).\nFDAS has a central-memory requirement\nof approximately 360,000 bytes.

The honeycomb is designed to absorb impact energy by buckling, while the inner and outer skins - 0.15\nand 0.125 in.

Notable among the\nmethods incorporated into this scheme is\nthat of pseudocompressibility, in which the\nincompressible fluid is considered to have\na small artificial compressibility.\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are written\nNASA Tech Bri efs, Ju ne 1990\n\nin the form of conservation laws in nondimensional variables . A derivative of\npressure with respect to pseudotime is\nadded to the equation of continuity to couple the pressure directly to the velOCity.\nIterations are performed to obtain the\ndivergence-free velocity field that satisfies\nthe equation of continuity. The equations\nare then advanced to the next step in physical time, and the iterations are performed\nin pseudotime until a divergence-free velocity field is obtained again.\n\nAA upwind-differencing scheme based\non flux-difference splitting is used to compute the convective terms . Upwind differencing increases the speed of computation by making the numerical process\nmore stable. The upwind differencing is\nbiased on the basis of the sign of the local\neigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix. Third- or\nfifth-order spatial accuracy is maintained\nthroughout the interior points of the grid.\nEquations are solved in an implicit line\nrelaxation scheme. This scheme is stable\n71\n\nand can accoomodate large steps in pseudotime, leading to fast convergence at\neach step in physical time. Implicit, nonreflective boundary conditions based on the\nmethod of characteristics enable the\nplacement of the boundary relatively close\nto the body about which the flow is computed.\nThe scheme has been verified by application to several flows, ranging from very\nsimple ones for which analytical solutions\nare available (see figure) to more complex\nflows that include the shedding of vortices\nand for which experimental data and other\ncomputational data are available. The predictions of the new scheme agree well with\nthe previously obtained analytical , experimental, and numerical results.\nThis work was done by D. Kwak of\nAmes Research Center and S. E.

Analysis of\nrocket tu rbine blades has shown that radial\nand chordwise cracks occur after various\namounts of cyclic testing. Because radial\ncracks are relatively benign in comparison\nwith chordwise cracks, the prior appearance of a radial crack or cracks in a used\nblade could serve as a warning that a\n\nmore-threatening crorctvVise crack or cracks\nmay subsequently appear. The blade could\nthen be replaced before it fails.\nAdvance radial cracking could be promoted in design by adjusting thermal\nstresses and net bending stresses. Thermal stresses depend on the local thickness\nThin Wall In This Region To\nIncrease Chordwlse-Crack Life\n\nFigure 1.

By judicious distribution of the\nthicknesses on the concave and convex\nsurfaces, the radial- and chordwise-crack\nlives could be adjusted.\nNet bending stresses are the sums of\ngas bending and tilt bending stresses.

The mathematical model\nof the panel includes skin elements and assemblies of thin, flat, rectangular plate elements that represent the stiffening ribs.\nThe loads on each plate element are calculated under the assumption of uniform\nlongitudinal strain. The transverse load is\nassumed to be carried by the skin elements. In this application, a fillet is approximated by a stack of thin plate elements, the\nwidths of which increase at the transition\nfrom the rib to the skin. This provides a\nstepped-cross-section approximation to\nthe rounded cross section of the real fillet.\nA biaxially stiffened panel can be analyzed by treating it as an assembly of uni-\n\naxially stiffened panels, the interfaces\nbetween which are the locations of the\ntransverse stiffeners. However, PASCO\nalone cannot account for the boundary\nconditions (other than the simply-supported-beam condition) at the interfaces.\nTherefore, the WAFFLE program, which\nprovides a comprehensive stress analysis\nof a waffle panel, can be used to determine\nbending moments at the interfaces.\nThe experiments consisted of buckling\ntests of waffle panels, which were instrumented with strain gauges. Stress readings\ntaken in the buckled regions were compared, where applicable, with the predictions of WAFFLE, of PASCO without the\nfillet approximation, and of PASCO with the\n\nBooks and Reports\nThese reports, studies, handbooks are\navailable from NASA as Technical\nSupport Packages (TSP\'s) when a Request Card number is cited; otherwise\nthey are available from the National\nTechnical Information Service.\n\nNumerical Simulation of\nBuckling in Waffle Panels\nAccurate results are\nobtained when fillet\nradii are considered.\nTwo reports describe a numerical and\nexperimental study of the application of the\nPASCO and WAFFLE computer programs\nto the analysiS of buckling in an integrally\nmachined, biaxially stiffened panel (which\nresembles a waffle). The waffle pockets of\nsuch panels are machined with rounded fillets, the radii of which were not taken into\naccount in previous applications of pAS/X).\nAs a result, previous panel designs were\noverconservative; that is, the structures\nwere designed to be heavier than they had\nto be to withstand the anticipated buckling\nloads.\nPASCO (Panel Analysis and Sizing Code)\nis a finite-element stress-and-strain code\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1990\n\nFor tracking and positioning anything\nfrom a cursor to a crane, MSI offers\nyou the greatest range of high quality,\ndisplacement and force-operated\njoysticks.

These calculations are important to future design studies\nbecause it is necessary to determine the\nneed for COOling by transpiration or ablation of the most-severely heated surfaces.\nEven approximate previous calculations\nhad shown that the requirements for thermal protection would be determined by the\nconditions during ascent. This is because\nthe vehicle would use primarily an airbreathing engine or engines, and consequentlythe ascent trajectory would have to\ninvolve a long flight through the atmosphere at up to nearly orbital speeds. The\nsevere aerodynamic heat filuxes and total\nheat loads of such hypervelocity ascent\nthrough the atmosphere would be more\nsevere than those to be encountered during entry and descent.\nThe calculations begin with the study of\ntrajectories likely to be used, so that trajectories can be varied parametrically to obtain a range of realistic heating conditions.\nRates of heating, temperatures of the walls,\nand total heat loads were calculated for\nlaminar flow at the stagnation point and for\nlaminar, transitional, and turbulent flows\nalong the leading edge of a postulated\nwing, and on the centerline of the windward bottom surface. Calculated rates of\nheating were compared with data from\nflights of the Space Shuttle.\nThe numerical results of the calculations show that the combination of the high\nheating rates experienced by surfaces\nwith small curvatures and the long ascent\ntimes would result in severe heating and\nlarge total heat loads. The peak equilibrium\ntemperatures of the walls at the leading\nedge of the wing and at the stagnation\npoint during ascent could reach values of\n3,000 and 4,000 K, respectively, in trajectories of high dynamic pressure. Therefore\nactive cooling, such as transpiration or\nablation, may be required in these regions\nof the vehicle. (The corresponding temperatures during entry would be about 1,500 K\nlower.)\nHowever, the temperature on the windward centerline would be lower, with peak\nvalues of about 1,500 K. Therefore, radiative cooling should be effective over large\nareas of the vehicle. In contrast with the\nheat loads at the stagnation point and at\nthe leading edge ofthewing, the heat loads\non the windward centerline would be relatively insensitive to the dynamic pressure\nof the ascent trajectory. The heat loads for\nthe windvvard surface during entry would be\nmuch lower but would depend strongly on\nthe flightpath .\nThis work was done by Michael E.

Mjustable valves of different configurations\n(e.g., gate and globe valves) that could handle the mass flows and pressures of the\ntests are too expensive and bulky, and they\ndivert the flow away from straight streamlines to an extent that is undesirable for the\npurposes of the tests.\nThe valve includes an orifice housing,\nwhich is essentially a thick, stationary disk\nwith six sectoral holes. Immediately upstream of the fixed disk is a rotatable disk\nwith a similar pattern of holes.

As can be seen in the figure, the\noverlapping holes lie along or near most\nstreamlines, so that the variable orifices effect minimal diversion of the flow.\nThe rotatable disk is turned by a hydraulic rotary actuator. The angular position of\nthe actuator and rotatable disk is measured by a shaft-angle encoder. The valve\ncan be calibrated in terms of angle or open\nflow area versus back pressure, so that the\nvalve can be preset at the angle necessary\nto obtain the desired back pressure.\nThe remotely-controlled variable-orifice\n\nvalve is small in comparison with other\ntypes of valves designed to control similar\nflows and pressures. The valve can be\nmoved easily from one flOW-test facility to\nanother. It can be sandwiched between\ntwo 18-in. (46-cm) flanges and requires an\naxial gap of only 5 in.

To a first\napproximation, the motor and reaction\nwheel dedicated to damping vibrations\nabout a given axis would produce reaction\ntorques that oppose those vibrations when\nthe motor is excited by an opposing voltage\nproportional to the corresponding component of linear/angular velocity.\nFigure 2 illustrates, in greater detail, the\nprocessing of accelerometer outputs into\nmotor-control signals for one axis. The\ndifferential-acceleration signals would first\nbe integrated to obtain the velocity signal,\nthen simultaneously band-pass filtered at\nthe frequencies of n l<I1own modes of vibration of the particular structure about the\nparticular axis. When the velocity signal in\neach modal channel exceeded a predeterNASA Tech Briefs, June 1990\n\nmined threshold, it would be fed to a compensation network, which would condition\nit for proper phasing for use by the motor.\nAfter conditioning, the signal would be\namplified by an amount appropriate for\neach mode.\nThe amplified signal for each modal\nchannel would be fed to the motor through\na stepping switch. Once the velocity signal\nin each modal channel was reduced below\nthe threshold, the switch would step to\nanother channel. The switch could be controlled by either sequential stepping logic\nor by highest-modal-vibration-energy logic.\nThus, a single accelerometer-inertia wheel\ncould be used to damp several vibration\nmodes about one axis sequentially. If a\nthree-axis damper (two orthogonal directions for bending and a third axis for torsion) is on each of the major appendages\nof the spacecraft (see Figure 1), with ap-\n\npropriate logic coordinating the dampers,\nthen all of the significant system vibration\nmodes can be damped.\nThis work was done by Joseph V.

This combination of state-of\xc2\xb7the-art\ncomponents would offer the thermodynamic efficiency of the Stirling cycle, relatively low vibration, and automatic adjustment of operating parameters to suit the\nchanging load on the generator.\nFigure 1 is a partially schematic axial\nview of the inside of the rotary Stirling engine. Three rotors are mounted on concentric shafts in the cylindrical engine chamber.\nEach rotor is a pair of diametrically opposite,\npaddlelike sectors of cylinders that act as\nrotary pistons. Heat from an external\nsource enters the working gas of the engine (for example, helium) through the right\nheat exchanger at the top of the engine.\nExhaust heat from the engine leaves\nthrough the left heat exchanger at the bottom.\nEach rotor moves clockwise at a speed\nthat varies semisinusoidally with its angular position so that it alternately almost\ncatches up with and then falls behind the\nrotor that moves in front of it. The motions\nof the rotors are coordinated in such a way\nthat the following combination of compression and expansion cycles occurs:\n1. Cool working gas is drawn into the\nchamber through the lower left port as\nthe rotary piston ahead of the valve races\nahead of the piston behind the valve.\n2. The piston ahead slows down, the piston\nbehind races ahead, and the cool gas is\ncompressed between the two pistons as\nthey move toward the upper left port.\n3. As the space enclosed by the two rotary\npistons passes the upper left port, the\ncompressed gas flows through the upper\nleft heat exchanger, where it receives\nrecycled heat, then flows through the upper right heat exchanger, where it receives heat from the extemal source.\n4. The compressed, heated gas enters the\nspace between two rotary pistons through\nthe upper right port. This gas expands as\nthe piston in front races ahead of the\npiston behind.\n5. The piston ahead passes the lower right\nvalve, allowing the expanded, hot gas to\nstart escaping through the lower right\nheat exchanger, which recyles some of\nits heat to the upper left heat exchanger,\nthen continues through the lower left heat\n78\n\nexchanger, which rejects the unusable\nheat to the environment. The piston behind catches up, helping to push the hot\ngas through the lower heat exchangers.\n6.

The method is intended for a\ncryogenic turbopump in which the race is\nmade of 440e stainless-steel alloy and the\nshaft is made of Inconel* 100 nickel alloy.\nThe stainless-steel race material is chosen\nfor its hardenability. The coefficient of thermal expansion of the stainless steel is\nmore than 15 percent less than that of the\nnickel alloy. Therefore, as the cryogenic liquid cools the pump, the race loosens on\nthe shaft because the shaft shrinks more\nthan the race. The centrifugal force at the\nhigh rotational speed of the turbopump\nadds to the loosening of the race.\nIf the race were allowed to loosen\nenough to slip on the shaft, it would wear\nand gall the shaft. Accordingly, the practice\nhas been to shrink-fit the race when it is installed on the shaft. But this creates tensile\nstresses in the race that can cause stresscorrosion cracking while the turbopump is\nstored at room temperature before use.\nIn the proposed new method of attaching the race, the guiderail flanges of the\nrace, which guide the rollers, would be replaced by tension bands of a strong material that has a coefficient of thermal expansion greater than that of the 440e alloy.\nOne such material is Waspalloy, which has\na coefficient substantially larger than those\nof both the stainless-steel and nickel alloys.\nAs the assembly would cool , the Waspalloy\ntension bands would shrink more than\nwould the race or shaft, so that the tension\nbands would hold the race firmly on the\nshaft.\nLike the stainless-steel alloy, Waspalloy\nis strong and resistant to corrosion. It cannot be hardened as much as the 440e alloy, but it is tougher. Inasmuch as the rollers\nmake contact with the flanges only interNASA Tech Briefs, June 1990\n\nmittently, the tougher, slightly softer flange\nmaterial may prove to be superior.\n* Inconel is a registered trademark of the\nINCO family of companies.\nThis work was done by Dale H.

The mechanism is intended for use\nwith a shield like the one described in the\npreceding article "Crash-Resistant Shield"\n(NPO-17616).\nThe mechanism would include a seg-\n\nmented-band device that would hold the\nshield on a base on which the equipment to\nbe protected is mounted (see FlQure 1). An\nelectrically actuated explosive separator\nwould hold the band together. On command, the separator would release the\nsegments of the band from each other (see\nFigure 2).\nAt separation, a pair of springs would\npush the shield away from the base.\n\nRollers on the inside wall of the shield\nwould ride in a pair of diametrically 0pposed tracks. The tracks would guide the\nshield along its entire length until it separates from, and is safely clear of. the object\nto be protected and the rest of the vehicle.\nA truss would be connected to the shield\nfor support during maneuvers before ejection. Explosively retractable pins would join\nthe truss to the shield.The command to jettison would cause the retraction of the pins\nso that the shield could move freely.\nThis work was done by Richard A.

The pneumatic spring, which could be a bellows or a\npiston and cylinder, would exert a force independent of position along its stroke.\nThus, the gun could apply an accurately\ncontrolled force to the joint to be welded,\nwithout precise positioning at a critical\nposition within the stroke.\nA conventional spot-welding gun includes a spring-loaded welding tip and a\nswitch set at a tripping point within the\nstroke of the tip and spring, corresponding\nto a preset welding contact force. When\nthe tip is pressed against the workpiece\nwith the preset force, the switch initiates\nthe pulse of welding current. However,\nonce the welding current is initiated, the\nforce can deviate from the preset value\nbecause it depends on how far the spring is\nsubsequently compressed beyond the tripping point.\nIn the proposed spot-welding gun, the\nstatic contact force would depend only on\nthe atmospheric pressure and the pressure inside the pneumatic spring. The tripping force could be adjusted easily and accurately by adjusting a pressure sensor\nandlor a pressure regulator that would\nfeed the pneumatic spring. Pos an additional benefit, during the typical short duration of the welding pulse, the pressure in\nthe pneumatic spring could momentarily\nbe increased substantially to apply a\nwelding contact force greater than the\ntechnician could exert by pushing against\nthe weld. This mode of operation would rely\non the mass of the gun and the technician\nto minimize recOil, in a manner similar to\nthat of a firearm.\nThis YrOrk was done by Richard K.

The carrier holds\nthe harness while the operator is fabricating it, while it is being stored, and while it is\nbeing transported to an equipment frame\nfor mounting. Previously, three people\nwere needed to move the board, which\nmeasures 8 by 5 ft (2.4 by 1.5 m) and\nweighs 54 Ib (24 kg), exclusive of the harness.\nThe operator assembles the harness on\nthe board while the carrier holds the board\nin locking channels and supports it at a\nconvenient height and angle (see figure).\nWhen the work is complete, the operator\nremoves a safety lockpin from the carrier\nand lifts the right side of the board, tilting it\nto a vertical orientation. The operator locks\na safety arm to maintain the board in the\nvertical orientation and presses an electri\xc2\xb7\ncal switch on the carrier to lower the board\nonto a roller track on the base of the carrier.\nThe operator unlocks the casters on the\nbase and rolls the carrier and board to a\n\ncabinet for storage. At the cabinet, the ~\nerator pushes the board along the roller\ntrack forward into a vertical storage slot.\nWhen the time comes to take out the\nharness again, the operator reverses the\nprocedure, sliding the board back onto the\nroiler track on the carrier. For fabrication,\nthe carrier can be adjusted so that the\nboard is at an angle of 30\xc2\xb0, 45\xc2\xb0, or 60\xc2\xb0.\nSimilarly, the board can be raised or low\xc2\xb7\nered by the switch-operated motor on the\ncarrier.\nThis work was done by Samuel D.\nShepherd and Isaac Gurman of Rockwell\nInternational Corp. for Marshall Space\nAight Center.

The tool is designed for use in the narrow, intricate coolant channels of a rocket engine. The tool\nlends itself readily to modification for use in\nengine blocks, heat exchangers, general\nplumbing, and the like.\nThe tool includes a long polytetrafluoroethylene outer tube that contains a corrosion-resistant stainless-steel inner tube\ncovered with polytetrafluoroethylene. The\nworking end of the inner tube may have to\nbe bent to fit the narrow space in which it is\nto be used. The inside of the inner tube is\nlined with polytetrafluoroethylene.\nThe obstruction is located by a radiographic, infrared, or other suitable inspection technique. Together with a borescope,\nthe tool is threaded into the blocked channel until the working end approaches the\nobstruction. Magnets can be attached to\nthe working end of the outer tube to enable\nit to be pulled along the channel from outside. If the outer tube is prevented by the\nsize of the channel from moving farther, the\ninner tt.be can be pushed farther in through\nthe outer tube.\nA manual impact mechanism is attached\nto the outer end of the stainless-steel tube.\nA copper-coated stainless-steel wire is fed\n\n_\n--""\'"\n--.....\n\nTOOI..IH\n\nust.

The impact mechanism is then\n\nused to apply an impact load to the wire;\nand the wire, in turn, strikes the obstruction, hopefully breaking it loose. The dislodgement of the obstruction should be visible through the borescope. The removal of\ndebris is completed by flushing the passage at a high rate of flow and verified by\nradiographic or other suitable inspection.\nThis work was done by Steven K.

The use of the\nmodified barrel finisher eliminates the\nneed for shot peening (the conventional\nway to impart compressive stresses). It\ntherefore eliminates the rounding of edges\nand burrs caused by shot peening and,\nconsequently, the need for mass finishing\noperations to remove the burrs. In addition,\nthe modified barrel finisher improves the\nsurface finish of the "fir trees."\nThe turbine blades are suspended in a\nceramic-based abrasive slurry that is contained along the periphery of the barrel\nfinisher. The barrel finisher is rotated very\nrapidly to generate extremely high centrifugal loads, which are distributed evenly\n\nslurry. These loads generate the residual\ncompressive stresses.\nThose portionS of the surfaces of the\nblades that are not to undergo compressive loading are masked with urethane or\nepoxy before insertion in the barrel finisher.\nThe barrel-finishing process removes only\nabout 10 -5 in.

STAR"TooL\nprovides the language and capabilities for\nthe compilation of application programs\nwritten in the Common LISP programming\nlanguage. Unlike other expert-system\n"shell " programs, STAR"TooL features\nmodularity that enables the elimination of\nunnecessary capabilities from the final application program and thereby achieves\ngreater computing performance.\nThe unique approach of STAR "TOOL to\nthe creation of knowledge-based systems\nis based in part on the use of sophisticated\ncompiler techniques. STAR"TooL can be\nrun on any computer that supports Common LISP and that has sufficient memory.\nSTAR"TooL provides the programmer\nwith the necessary software tools to build a\nwide variety of reasoning and inference engines for such applications as planning, diagnosis and analysis, and simulation. The\nhigh efficiency of STAR"TOOL\'s implementation also enables the building of realtme systems, including those for monitoring\nreal-time processes. Vv\'hen STAR"TooL is\nrun in an environment that supports multiple programming languages, STAR"TooLs\ncapabilities can be utilized via local and remote procedure calls and through shared\ndata structures. This enables portions of\nthe application system to be developed in\nthe most suitable programming language\nand allows such portions to be connected\nto the Common LISP STAR "TOOL application in a straightforward, natural way.\nSTAR"TooL enables and encourages\nthe development of embedded expert systems. Thus, STAR"TooL could be a supervisor of many other systems written in\neither STAR"TooL or conventional programming languages. Most of the software\ntools provided by STAR " TOOL, such the\nblackboard, memory model, process model, and process scheduler, can operate independently of one another (see figure).\nHowever, when operated in combination ,\nthey form a fully integrated synergistiC set\nof software tools. Since the user is able to\nchoose only those portions of STAR " TOOL\nthat are applicable to a given application,\nthe computational overhead of including\nunnecessary excess software is avoided,\n86\n\nresulting in greater application effiCiency.\nThus, the resulting application program\ncan run on a smaller computer than the\none on "Yhich it was developed.\nWhen an application program is developed in STAR "TOOL, STAR"TooL first\ntranslates the program to Common LISP\ncode. It can then optionally pass the resulting Common LISP code through an extensive source-to-source LISP code optimizing compiler. STAR " TOO L generates code\nthat is custom-tailored for each application. There are no intermediate levels of interpretation for execution, unlike many\nother knowledge-based system software\nshells. STAR"TooL programs are executed directly by Common LISP interpreter\n\nMajor\nSubsystems\nof\nSTAR-TOOL\n\nand compiled directly by Common LISP\ncompiler. This results in greater speed and\nbetter portability to other computers.\nSTAR " TOOL builds upon the Common LISP\nprogramming language and environment\nso that programs written in STAR " TOOL\nhave direct use of all the features of the underlying Common LISP software systems\nand computing environment.\nA single line of STAR " TOOL code can\ntranslate into many lines of Common LISP\ncode. To support ease in application system development and subsequent software maintenance, all error messages\ngenerated from the STAR "TOOL compiler\nand run-time environment reference the\noriginal STAR"TooL source code.

The protocol applies to a muitiple-channel packetmessage system with synchronous timeslots on all channels. During each timeslot\nit is possible to transmit only one packet of\ndata on each channel. Simultaneous requests from two or more originating stations for connection to the transmission\nmedium can result in "collisions" between\npackets on a channel. The problem in devising a protocol is to resolve such collisions in a manner that is stable, prevents\ndeadlocks, and provides for efficient utilization of channels and times lots.\nThe communication system has Q channels. Transmissions of packets are allowed\nto begin only at the beginnings of the timeslots. The system provides, to all users,\nbinary feedback information on the state of\nthe channel - namely, whether or not\nthere is a collision - during each timeslot.\nWhen the round-trip propagation delay is\nnegligible in comparison with the packettransmission time, the feedback information is known to the users immediately at\nthe end of each timeslot.\nThen the protocol is as follows:\n1. An attempt is made to transmit a new\npacket immediately at the start of the first\ntimeslot that follO\'NS its arrival by independently selecting one of the Q channels\nwith probability 1/0.\n\n(Three Channels)\n\n20\n\n\'iii\'\n\n~ 15\n\n!!2.\n\n~\n~ 10\n\n---\n\nOL-__- L____L -__- i_ _\n0.000 0.100\n\n0.200\n\n0.300\n\nDo It Yourself\nTest Systems For\nAerospace\nEngineers\n\n~\n\n0.400\n\nThroughput, Packets Per Channel\nPerTlmeslot\n\nThe New Collision-Resolution Protocol results In decreased delay and increased\nthroughput.\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1990\n\nbasis.

The next attempt to transmit the packets\nthat collide in channel i will be made during a timeslot in which all collisions in\nchannels 1 through i -1 shall have been\nresolved. This attempt will be made by independently selecting one of the Q channels with prd:>ability Q. When the roundtrip prcpagation delay is equal to d slots,\nthe feedback information is known to the\nuser d + 1 slots later. In this case, d + 1 interleaved copies of the above protocol\nare er1l>loyed.\nThe throughput performance of the new\nprotocol was derived analytically and the\ndelay performance obtained by computer\n\nsimulations, assuming an infinite number\nof users and a Poisson distribution of arrival times of packets at a rate of Apackets\nper timeslot. As measured in terms of the\naverage delay per packet necessitated by\nretransmission of colliding packets in a\nthr~hannel system, the new protocol is\nsuperior to a previous collision-resolution\nprotocol (see figure). The maximum stable\nthroughput of the new protocol is 0.402\npackets per channel per timeslot, while\nthat of the older protocol is 0.368 packets\nper channel per timeslot.\nThis work was done by Harry H.

In computer simulations, the\nalgorithm increased the number of landings by 3 to 5 percent at a representative\nairport, Stapleton at Denver.\nThe algorithm rearranges the order of\nlanding according to the weight class of\neach airplane. For example, inasmuch as\na lighter airplane must follow a heavier one\nat a relatively large distance to avoid a\ndangerous wake, landings could be speeded ~ a group of heavy aircraft were made to\nfollow a group of lighter ones. Of course,\nthe algorithm limits the extent of one rearrangement to avoid penalizing any airplane\nor category of airplanes.\nThe algorithm is a version of a wellknown algorithm for the "traveling-salesman" problem, which selects an efficient\nitinerary for sales calls. The object of the\naircraft-scheduling algorithm is to minimize the time in which the last airplane in a\nstring of arriving airplanes is allowed to\nland. It observes the following rules:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The first airplane must still be scheduled\nfirst in the revised schedule.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 M airplane must be scheduled within a\npreset number of landing slots of its orig~\nnal position.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Airplanes following the same incoming\nroute may not pass one another.\nThe algorithm takes the original order of\narrival as the initial schedule and computes the time to land all airplanes. It then\nrandomly selects adjacent airplanes and\ninterchanges their landing order. It generates a new schedule, but one that is still\nfeasible according to the rules. Starting\nwith the new schedule, the algorithm considers all feasible repositionings of a given\nairplane and the associated time to land\nthe aircraft. It selects the best repositionings. The algorithm does this for each air-\n\nc:\nfl\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\n7.0\n\n:;\n\nQ.\n\nr;\n\ng 3.5\n\ne\n\n~\n\n-=\n\n3l\n\n~\n\nu\n\n-=\n\nO ~----~1~----~2------~3\n\nMaximum Position Shift (MPS)\n\nThe Increase In Throughput of an airport is\nincreased in a simulation in which the order\nof landing of any airplane in the queue is\npermitted to shift by a number of positions\nup to the maximum position shift (MPS).\nThe resulting new schedule is a suboptimum solution to the scheduling problem\nand approaches the optimum as the MPS\nincreases.\n\ncraft to arrive at the solution - a nearly\noptimum schedule (see figure).\nIn simulations, the time required to\nschedule a queue of 40 aircraft on a V/lX\ncomputer ranged from 10 to 30 seconds.

The PO controller places\nthe poles of the transfer function (in Laplace-transform space) of the control system for the linearized mathematical model\nof the dynamics of the robot. The PIO controller tracks the trajectory and decouples\nthe input from the output.\nThe mathematical model of the dynamics of an n-joint robotic manipulator can be\nrepresented by a set of coupled nonlinear\ndifferential equations of the general form\nM(B)B + N(B.9) + G(B) + H(9) = T\nwhere t\ntime; fX,t).9(t) and 8(t) are the\nn x 1 vectors of joint angles,velocities, and\naccelerations respectively; T(t) is the n x 1\nvector of joint torques; M(fJ) is the n x n inertia matrix, N(B.U) is the n x 1 Coriolis-andcentrifugal-torque vector; G(B} is the n X 1\ngravity-loading vector; and H (B) is the n x 1\nfrictional-torque vector. This s~t of eq~a\xc2\xad\ntions is highly nonlinear in fX,t), fX,t), and fX,t).\nThe problem is to obtain a control\nscheme that generates the jOint torques\nT(t) required to ensure that the joint angles\nfX,t) track the reference trajectories B/t)\nas closely as possible. The multivariable\ncontroller, which is designed to do this, is\nbased on linear multivariable control\ntheory. The theory, in turn, requires a linearized mathematical model of the dynamics\nof the robot. The model is, in effect, piecewise-linear because the equations of mer\ntion are treated as linear for small perturbations during small intervals of time.\nThe controller derived from the linearized equations (see figure) includes the\nstabilizing (inner-loop) controller K(s) and\nthe tracking (outer-loop) controller O(s)\nwhere Kand 0 are transfer-function matrices and s is the Laplace-transform complex frequency.

In\nthe second approach, high controller gains\nare used to obtain desirable performance\nduring gross motion and changes in the\npayload. In the high-gain approach, uncertainties in the mathematical model of the\ndynamics of the robot have negligible effect on the performance of the closed-loop\nsystem.\nThe results of the numerical simulation\nof a controller for a twerlink manipulator\nshow that satisfactory performance is 0btained even when the robot is subjected to\nlarge changes in payload and torque disturbances.

In\nthe new method, the theories of the two\nprior methods are incorporated into a unified theory, which yields a more general adaptation scheme.\nIn the signal-synthesis method, an "auxiliary" signal is synthesized by the adaptation scheme and is fed into the system to\nsupplement the operation of a nominal\nfixed controller. In the parameter-adaptation method, the gains of the controller are\nadjusted by the adaptation scheme; no external signals are introduced. In both\nmethods, the objective is to match the response of the system with that of a predefined reference model.\nThe new method applies to an MRAC\nsystem that includes both an adjustable\nsystem and a reference model (see figure).\nThe adjustable system contains both the\nplant to be controlled, which is fixed, and\nthe controller, which can be adjusted. For\ninstance, given the multivariable plant\nM(t)y(t) + N(t)i/(t) = v(t)\nwith the control law\nv(t)\nf (t) + K(t)[Yr(t) - y(t)] + O(t)Yr(t)\nthe adjustable system is obtained as\ny(t) = [- M -1(N + K)]y(t) +\n[M -1(K + 0)] y~t) + [M- 1f(t)]\n\n=\n\nwhere t = time, v is the m X 1 control vector, y and Yr are the m x 1 actual and reference output vectors, M and N are the\nm X m plant matrices with IMI 0, f is the\nm X 1 auxiliary input vector, and K and 0\nare the m xm controller~ain matrices.\nIn general, the adjustable system can\nbe represented by the state model\nx(t)\nA(t)x(t) + B(t)u(t) + w(t)\nwhere x(t) is the n X 1 state vector, u(t) is\nthe m X 1 reference input vector, w(t) is the\nn x 1 auxiliary input vector to be synthesized, and A and Bare n xn and n xm\ntime-varying matrices that contain adjustable parameters, and all entries of A, B,\nand w can be adjusted independently. The\nreference model expresses the desired\nperformance of the system specified by\nthe designer as\nxm(t) = A~m(t) + Bmu(t)\nwhere xm(t) is the n x 1 model state vector,\nand Am and Bm are constant prespecified\nn X n and n X m matrices. The reference\nmodel is stable. The MRAC problem is to\nadjust the parameters of A(t) and B(t) and to\nsynthesize the signal w(t) in such a way\nthat for any arbitrary input u(t), the state x(t)\n\n*\'\n\nof the system approaches the model state\nxm asymptotically.\n(t)\nThe laws of the adaptation scheme are\nderived from the dynamics of the adaptatioo-error vector e(t)\nx,J.t)-x(t). The derivatioo involves the use of an improved\nLyapunov function. The results are given\nby\nt\n\n=\n\nw(t)\nA(t)\n\n= w(O) + O~Pe(t) + 0 0 1pIe(t)dt\n\n= A(0)+0;P[e(t)x \'(t)](S~ -1 +\nt\n\n0 1 1pI[e(t)x\'(t)}::It(S2)-1\n\nand\n8(t)\n\n= B(0)+0;P[e(t)u \'(t)](RID -1 +\nt\n\nOi1pI[e(t)u \'(t)}::It(R2)-1\n\nwhere the O\'s, R\'s, and S\'s denote constant weighting matrices and P is the solution of the Lyapunov equation for the\nreference model.\nIt is interesting to note that the auxiliary\nsignal w(t) can be generated by a proportionaHntegra! (PI) controller with constant\ngainsKp = OoPandK, = 0 o\'Pdrivenby\nthe adaptation error e(t).

Polyethylene glycol was used in\nthe experiments, but it is expected that\nother neutral, hydrophilic polymers like\npolyvinyl alcohol and copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol could also\nbe used.\nThe objective is to electrophoretically\nseparate specific macromolecules, cells,\nor other particles on the basis of their\nspecific interactions with immunoglobulins\n(immuno-affinity electrophoresis), alkyl\nhydrophobic molecules (hydrophobic-affinity electrophoresis), or other ligands (ligand-affinity electrophoresis). In a precursor to the new technique, reported in 1981,\npoIyethylene.glycol-linked dyes that have\nspecific affinities for certain types of\nnucleic acids were used to carry out ligand-affinity electrophoresiS of fragments\nof deoxyribonucleic acid molecules.\nIn the new technique, the reduction of\nelectrophoretic mobilities by the addition\nof polyethylene glycol to the ligands increases the electrophoretic separabilities.\nIn immuno-affinity electrophoresis, this\nmodification of the ligands extends the\nspecificity of electrophoretic separation to\nparticles that have surface electric-charge\nstructures that would otherwise make\nthem electrophoretically inseparable. Furthermore, the modification of the antibodies by polyethylene glycol greatly\nreduces their ability to aggregate while\nenhancing their ability to affect the electrophoretic mobilities of cells. In hydrophobic-affinity electrophoresis, the addition of polyethylene glycol also reduces the\ntendency toward the aggregation of cells\nor macromolecules.\nThis work was done by James M.

The pores in\nthe hollow fiber allow exchange of gases,\nnutrients, and metabolic waste products\nbetween the IMng cells and the extemal\nculture media. The hollow fiber lies on the\naxis of the vessel (see figure), which is\nrotated by a motor equipped with torque\nand speed controls. The desired temperature is maintained by operating the clinostat in a standard tissue-culture incubator.\nThe axis of rotation can be made horizontal\nor vertical.\nCells are Injected into the lumen of the\nfiber through a hypodermic needle. The\nends of the fiber are then sealed by hot wax\nor by heat alone, and the fiber is mounted\nin a fiber holder under spring tension,\nwhich keeps it aligned with the axis. The\nholder is mounted in the vessel, the vessel\nis filled with the culture medium, and the\nvessel is sealed. Ports in the vessel provide\naccess for exchange and sampling of the\nculture medium and for the injection of biochemical agents. The clinostat is designed\nfor use with conventional methods of sterilization and sanitation to prevent contamination of the specimen. It is also designed\nfor asepsis in assembly, injection of the\nspecimen, and exchange of the medium.\nDepending on the difference between\nthe densities of the cells (or particles to\nwhich the cells are attached) and the liquid\nin which they are suspended, the particles\nmay settle down to motion within circular\ntrails about a horizontal axis of rotation.\nWhen the rotation is sufficiently rapid,\nmlcrogravity is simulated in the sense that\n\nr\nJ\n\nWall of\nVessel\n\nRotation\n\nIn the Hollow-FIber Cllnostat, shown here In simplified schematic form , specimen cells are\nsuspended in liquid Inside a hollow fiber on the axis of a culture vessel. The vessel and fiber\nrotate about the axis to simulate some of the effects of mlcrogravlty.\n\nthe particles cease to move vertically. The\nsimulation approaches 100 percent for\nparticles In suspensions in which the centrifugal forces and Brownian motions offset each other. Operation with rotation\nabout a vertical axis provides the motional\ncondition for a control experiment in the\nsense that the gravitation is then constant\nalong the axis. Another control condition is\nprovided by non rotational operation with\nthe axis horizontal.\nThe hollow-fiber-clinostat concept also\nembraces several alternative designs.\nSuspension cultures of cells or organisms\ncan be studied by selecting speeds of rotation that maintain the positions of the cells\nwithin the fiber. Larger quantitites of cells\nor organisms can be tested by lengthening\nthe fiber, fiber holder, and culture vessel.\n\nSlip-type connectors and tubing can be\nadded for continual circulation of the CUlture medium to enable monitoring and/or\ncontrol of the concentrations of substanc\xc2\xb7\nes in the medium. Cells or organisms de\xc2\xb7\npendent on anchorage could be grown on\nbeads injected into the hollow fiber. This\nwould facilitate removal of samples of cells\nfrom the fiber.\nThis work was done by Percy H. Rhodes,\nTeresa Y. Miller, and Robert S. Snyder of\nMarshall Space Right Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA system for the measurement of respiratory flow employs two flowmeters, which\nare complementary: one compensates for\nthe deficiencies of the other. The combination yields an easily calibrated system that\nis accurate over a wide range of gas flow.\nThe flowmeters are in series in the flow\npath. A vortex flowmeter has stable characteristics, so that it rarely needs calibration. Its accuracy is independent of the\ncomposition, pressure, and temperature of\nthe gas. However, it is not accurate over\n96\n\nthe entire range of flow rates from rest to\nmaximum exercise. A pneumotach flowmeter provides a linear output over the\ncomplete range of flow, but It tends to drift\nand needs frequent calibration . It also\nneeds compensation for changes in the\ncomposition of the gas.\nThe vortex flowmeter, which can go for\nyears without calibration, even in rugged\nduty, is therefore used as a calibration\nstandard for the pneumotach flowmeter\nwhenever the flow through the vortex flow-\n\nmeter exceeds its lower operating threshold. During each breath, the outputs of\nboth flowmeters are stored in arrays of\ndata. At the end of each breath, if enough\ndata are recorded and if the peak flow was\nhigh enough, a linear regression between\nthe two flowmeter signals is calculated,\nand the regression coefficient is used to\ncalibrate the pneumotach.\nThis work was done by Dwayne R.\nWestenskow and Joseph A.

Marketed\nunder the trade name CorTemp by\nHuman Technologies Inc. of St. Petersburg, Florida, the Ingestible Thermal\nMonitoring System (ITMS) enables\nimproved patient care in hospitals and\noffers opportunities in medical experimentation.\nThe 0.6" x 0.4" silicone capsule contains a telemetry system , a microbattery, and a quartz crystal temperature\nsensor. When the capsule is ingested,\nits sensor resonates a frequency that\nvaries according to body temperature .\nThe oscillation drives a circuit with an\n"air" core coil , which responds by generating a magnetic field that passes harmlessly through the body and is detected\nby a coil connected to a remote receiver. The receiver amplifies the signal\nand sends it to a frequency counter,\nwhich converts the frequency into temperature . The receiver can be connected to a digital readout, or to a\ncomputer for data analysis. The ITMS\nmonitors continuously during the 24 to\n106\n\n72 hours it takes the capsule to travel\nthrough the digestive system . Its receiving unit can record a patient\'s temperature every 30 seconds, and can be\nprogrammed to sound an alarm if the\ntemperature exceeds preset limits. The\nunit can record and store 4500 temperature readings, requiring only battery replacement and the use of a series\nof capsules.\nResearchers developed the ITMS to\nobtain internal temperature readings for\ntreatment of such emergency conditions as dangerously low (hypothermia)\nand high (hyperthermia) body temperatures. Extremely accurate temperature\nreadings are vital in treating such cases.\nWhereas the average thermometer is\naccurate to 0.1\xc2\xb0C , the ITMS is off no\nmore than 0.05\xc2\xb0C, and provides the\nonly means of gauging deep body temperature.\nAlthough the concept for the temperature pill dates back to the 1950s, until\nnow technology could not produce\ncomponents small enough for an\ningestible capsule, while meeting reliability, accuracy, and cost objectives.\n"Fitting the components compatibly in\nthe smallest possible volume was probably the most difficult problem to solve,"\nsaid Dr. Russell Eberhart, project direr.-\n\ntor at APL. "Achieving the system\'s power,\nperformance, and high-density packing\nrequirements was possible only by incorporating NASA\'s recent technological advances."\nThe ITMS features such space-based\ntechnologies as miniaturized integrated\ncircuits, a rechargeable microbattery,\nand telemetry techniques originally developed for transmission of coded data\nsignals to Earth from orbiting satellites.\nThe capsule is listed with the Federal\nDru g Administration for one-time use. It\ncan be reused for animal research ,\nhowever, since its outermost silicon\ncoating remains unaltered. This coating\ncan be removed , the inner cylinder sterilized, the battery recharged , and the\ncapsule recoated.\nTo date, the system has been used\nfor research in areas such as reproductive endocrinology, substance abuse,\nobesity related to metabolism, gerontology (aging), and radiation treatments in\noncology. "The ITMS is now being utilized to monitor high-risk ambulatory\npatients in wards, one of the ultimate\napplications of the system ," said Arthur\nGimpelson, director of production at\nHuman Technologies. "It is also aiding\nin monitoring patients\' temperatures prior\nto and duri ng cardiac surgery, as well as\nin the post-operative recovery period."\nIn addition to these medical applications, the ITMS may be used to measure the internal temperature of food\nduring processing , and to study the\nreaction of foods to heat. Further, the\nmilitary wants to use the system to\ndetect when personnel in extremely hot\nor cold envi ronments are approaching\nlife-threatening conditions.\nAPL researchers are working on an\nadvanced, three-channel capsule that\nwill simultaneously monitor temperature,\nheart rate, and inner body pressure.\n\nTHE DIGESTIVE TRACT\n\nIllustration courtesy APL\n\nNASA Tech Briefs.
