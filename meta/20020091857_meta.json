In an effort to cut down on waste of electrical power used by these motors, Chesebrough organized a Corporate Advanced Technology Group to devise ways of improving productivity and cut manufacturing costs. Chesebrough used NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center's Power Factor Controller technology as a departure point for development of their own computerized motor controller that enables motors to operate at maximum efficiency regardless of the motor's applications or operating condition.", "title": "Big Savings from Smart Motors", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T22:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020091857, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020091857, "id": "fb5816aeb371470dad74c44333c5ae0f", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1984", "publicationDate": "1984-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020091857.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020091857/downloads/20020091857.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020091857/downloads/20020091857.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020091857/downloads/20020091857.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
