Photorefractive crystals promise information storage densities on the order of 10(exp 9) to 10(exp 12) bits per cubic centimeter at real-time rates. Several studies in recent years have investigated the use of photorefractive crystals for storing holographic image information. However, all of the previous studies have focused on techniques for storing information in a single crystal. The disadvantage of using a single crystal is that the read process is destructive. Researchers have developed techniques for fixing the information in a crystal so that it may be read many times. However, when fixed, the information cannot be readily erased and overwritten with new information. It two photorefractive crystals are used, holographic image information may be stored dynamically. That is, the stored image information may be read out more than once, and it may be easily erased and overwritten with new image information.", "title": "Optical storage device", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:31:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910013720, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Welch, Sharon S."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "959a849db25547c0a23c36cfb898b37c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910013720, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910013720, "id": "49c521d3326647c1ba9fa7899f981ee8", "publicationName": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Technology 2000, Volume 1", "publicationDate": "1991-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910013720.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910013720/downloads/19910013720.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910013720/downloads/19910013720.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910013720/downloads/19910013720.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
