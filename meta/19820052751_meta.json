The Centaur launch record is summarized and the Atlas/Centaur launch schedule is shown. Improvements in capability are reported on, and current and proposed vehicles are depicted. Dual Delta class spacecraft will be flown using a tandem adapter or large direct broadcast satellites in a single launch model. Shuttle/Centaur will permit spacecraft weights of up to 14,000 lb to be put into orbit, including payload lengths up to 40 ft. A new capability to transfer large deployed space systems from the Shuttle to high-altitude orbits at low thrusts will be available. Spacecraft lengths requiring the full, 60-foot cargo bay and weighing 20,000 lb could be placed in geosynchronous orbit with on-orbit rendezvous and assembly of the Centaur and spacecraft in low earth orbit.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19820052751, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "80824f679cc3419480076a781e184875", "id": "350a86008e3d4b2cb89fce6db958d12c"}], "name": "Communications Satellite System Conference", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "80824f679cc3419480076a781e184875", "startDate": "1982-03-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820052751, "id": "9eb55745722b45bcbf76cd8f386e041e", "publicationDate": "1982-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
