The system has a turboelectric power\nconversion system operating on the mercury-Rankine cycle. Considerable attention has been directed towards defining startup procedures for the power conversion system. The procedures must be dependable and, a t the same time, compatible with the operational constraints of the reactor.\nStartup studies have been both analytical and experimental. Computer si~nulations\nwere used to formulate promising startup procedures and to point out problem a r e a s \'equiring experimental investigation (Refs. 1, 2). The experimental startup worlr began in 1965\nwhen a simplified mercury-Ranlune system was coupled with a reactor simulator a t Lewis Research Center. This system was used to\nstudy reactor loop transients during startup of the mercury loop\n(Ref. 3). In 1968, the contractor for the power conversion system\n(Aerojet-General Corporation) conducted a s e r i e s of startup t e s t s on\na power conversion system using a gas-fired heat source. In these\ntests, the feasibility of completely automatic startups was demonstrated. The culmination of the startup work came in 1969 a t Lewis\nResearch Center when 135 startup t e s t s were conducted on a power\nconversion system coupled with a reactor simulator. F o r the f i r s t\ntime, startup procedures for a complete power conversion system\nw e r e experimentally evaluated concurrently with realistic reactor\nloop transients. The results a r e discussed in this paper.\nT e s t System and Startup Method\nSystem Description\n\na:\n\n,\n\nThe test system in the startup program was essentially a complete power conversion system coupled with a reactor simulator and\n\'adiator sinlulator. These simulators were used s o that the t e s t s\nwould include the dynamic interactions of these components with the\npower conversion system. The t e s t system was assembled in breadboard fashion rather than flight configuration; however, attention was\ngiven to preserving the first-order dynamic characteristics of a flightconfigured system.\nA simplified diagram of the t e s t system i s shown in Fig. I. The\n\'eactor simulator used an electric heater configured similar to the\nreactor. A power controller matched the heater electrical power\nwith the time-varying reactor power signal from an analog computer.\nDetails of the reactor simulator a r e given in Ref. 4. Heat from the\nF\nreactor simulator mas carried by 1 3 0 0 ~ NaK to the mercury boiler.\nMercury vapor from the boiler drove the turbine-alternator. Turbine\nexhaust flowed into the condenser where i t was condensed, subcooled\nand returned to the mercury pump. The condenser was cooled by\nMaI< and the waste heat was rejected by the radiator simulator. The\nzi i cooled heat exchangers of the radiator simulator had a heat capacity equal to the anticipated heat capacity of the space radiator.\n\':\'his heat capacity, together with feedback control on the outlet temperature, allowed simulation of the steady-state and transient characteristics of the radiator (Ref. 5). All loops used prototype centrit,.cg,:l pumps driven by electric motors. The power for the pump\nmotors \\\\?as supplied by the turbine-alternator.\n\nIn o r d e r to provide flexibility in conducting the test program, thc\n\ncontrols and other equipnient necessary lor startup were not flighttype. A gas-pressurized reservoir (Fig. 1)was used to injet the\nmercury-loop inventory during startup. An electrohydraulic flow\ncontrol valve in the mercury loop was used in a feedback control of\nmercury flow. A pneuinatic flow control valve in the heat-rejection\nloop was used in feedback control of the condenser coolant flow. This\nflow control was part of the condenser pressure control system to be\ndiscussed later. The other valves shown in Fig. 1 were used in the\non-off mode. Valve sequencing and other procedures were automated\nin 27 startups by use of a start programmer (ref. 6 ) . Additional details of the t e s t system a r e provided in Ref. 7.\nStartup Method\n\nIn SNAP-8 startup, the first step i s to start the reactor and\nslowly bring the reactor and boiler to operating temperature with the\nmercury loop evacuated. During this time the pumps in the NaK\nloops a r e running at reduced speed on battery-supplied inverter\npower. When the temperatures have stabilized, the startup of the\npower conversion system begins.\nFirst, the mercury pump is started with the inverter. Then the\nmercuiy reservoir valve (Fig. 1) i s opened and mercury fills the\nliquid lines from the condenser outlet valve to the boiler inlet valve.\nNext, the boiler inlet valve i s opened and the flow control valve s t a r t s\nthe flow ramp to the "self-sustaining" mercury flow, drawing inventory from the reservoir. Self-sustaining mercury flow i s defined a s\nthe steady-state flow that provides a safe margin of turbine-alternator\npower over that required by all the pumps a t rated speed. When the\noutput frequency of the accelerating turbine-alternator matches the\nfrequency of the auxiliary power going to the pumps, the pumps a r e\ntransferred to alternator power. The turbine-alternator-pump combination then "bootstrapsfl itself to rated speed. That is, the mercury pump provides the flow of power to the turbine, and the turbinealternator in turn, provides the power f o r the pump. At the end of\nthe mercury flow ramp, the valve a t the condenser outlet i s opened.\nThe mercury reservoir valve i s closed when the desired amount of\ninventory has been injected into the system. The mercury loop i s\nthen a closed system with the pump inlet pressurized by the condenser. P r e s s u r e a t the inlet of the condenser is controlled by the flow\ncontrol in the heat-rejection loop.\nThe startup sequence provides for a time-delay between the conclusion of the bootstrap operation and the start of the second \'amp in\nmercury flow. This delay allows reactor loop transients to subside.\nThe second ramp starts a t the self-sustaining mercury flow and concludes a t the flow that gives rated power output. This ramp, therefore, i s called the power ramp. At the end of the power ramp, the\nSNAP-8 system i s ready for use. The complete startup transients of\nmercury flow, speed of the rotating components, and net power output of the alternator a r e shoxvn i n Fig. 2.\nResults and Discussion\nBootstrap Operation\nThe most critical p a r t of the startup i s the bootstrap operation.\nA large share of the startup runs, therefore, were devoted to studying this operation Ninety-one runs mere made where some, o r all,\nof the pumps were brought to rated speed by the accelerating turbinealternator. One of the prime variables in these runs was the rate a t\nwhich the merculy flow was ramped up to the self-sustaining flow.\nThe objective was to determine the ramps that would givc dependable\nbootstrapping and, at the same time, cause minimuu~ndistui-bances in\nthe reactor loop.\nMaximum limit for duration of mercury flow ramp. - A startup\nshowing the m a s i ~ n u m\nlimit for duration of the bootstrap ramp is\nshown i n Fig. 3. Mercury flow and turbine-alternator speed a r e\nshown a s functions of time. The mercury flow was started up on a\n\nramp with an intended duration of 145 seconds, indicated by the dashpower a t\ned lines. After the punips were transferred to altel-~lator\n70 seconds, the turbine-alternator and pumps acceleyated slowly towards rated speed The accclcration was s o slow that the mercury\nflow dropped off the desired ramp. As the turbine-alternator approached rated speed, a small increment of load due to the activation\nof the speed control was added to the alternator load a t approximately\n100 seconds. With tlus addition, the load exceeded the available\npower, causing the turbine-alternator to decelerate rapidly. The\nnxercury flo\\v came do~.n, too, due to the deceleration of the punlp.\nAt this point, the pumps were manually transferred to a n auxiliary\npolver supply, allo~ving turbine-alternator to recover i t s accelthe\neration to rated speed. Othenvise, the startup xvould have been unsuccessful.\nAn understanding of the problem experienced in this run can be\ngained from Fig. 4. This i s a slcetch of the speed and power characteristics of the turbine and pumps during a typical bootstrap operation. In the speed plot, the initial pump speeds a r e represented by\nthe horizontal dashed line. The intersection of this dashed line with\nthe turbine speed curve represents the time of the pump transfer\nfrom auxiliary po\\srer t o alternator power. The remainder of the\nspeed curve, up to rated speed, applies to both the pumps and turbine\nand represexts the bootstrapping. The turbine power provided by the\nmercury flow ramp and the pump power load on the turbine-alternator\na r e shown in the power plot. Thc shaded a r e a represents the power\nmargin between the turbine and pumps. The turbine will accelerate\na t a rate proportional to this margin. The nunimum power margin\nthe\noccurs ~vhen turbine approaches rated speed because the power\nrequirement of the pumps goes up approximately with the cube of the\nspeed. If the duration of the mercury flow ramp i s too long, the\npumps will be requiring close to their rated power before the turbine\npower has reached the self-sustaining level. With a small power\nmargin any perturbation, such a s the one experienced i n the rnn\nsl~own Fig. 3, could cause deceleration of the turbine.\nin\nStartup test data i n Fig. 5 show the minimum turbine power margin a s a function of mercury flow ramp duration As s h o r n i n the\nfigure, the turbine power margin f o r the shorter ramps was equal to\nthe steady-state value associated with the final flow of the bootstrap\nramp. However, a s the ramp duration increased, the nunilnum\npower margin during the ramp decreased until i t was essentially zero\nf o r a ramp of 145 seconds duration.\nMinimum limit for duration of merculy flow ramp. - Decreasing\nthe duration of the mercury flow ramp from the 145-second limit,\ntherefore, increases the turbine power margin f o r bootstrapping. In\ndoing this, however, consideration must be given to two factors that\ntend to impose a minimum limit on the ramp duration. The f i r s t of\nthese was a problem encountered i n the mercury loop involving the\ntransient pressure-drop characteristics of the boiler. The second\nwas the concern regarding reactor loop transients.\nFigure 6 illustrates the mercury loop problem. Parameters\nshown a r e pump and turbine speeds, pump discharge pressure, boiler\ninlet and exit pressures, and niercury flow. The merculy flow ramp\nwas intended to be linear with a duration of about 30 seconds (dashed\nlines). While the mercury pump was still a t i t s initial speed, however, the flow fell off considerably from the intended ramp. This\nwas due to the nature of the pressure transients. Comparison of the\nboiler exit pressure transient with the merculy flow ramp indicates\nthat boiling began abruptly a t approximately 28 seconds. Then, the\nboiler illlet pressure r o s e sharply to a level approaching the merculy\npump discharge pressure. Consequently, the reduced pressure drop\navailable for the flow control valve, meant the scheduled flow ramp\ncould not be maintained A higher initial speed of the mercury pump,\nof course, would overcome this problem.\nThe initial speed of the mercury pump required to nlaintain the\nliorv \'amp was related to the duration of the merculy flow ramp.\nFigure 7 shows this relation. F o r a given ramp duratio4 initial\npump speeds above the curve produced sufficient pump discharge\np r e s s u r e to maintain the intended merculy flow ramp, despite the\neurge rn hoiler inlet pressure; initial pump speeds below the curve\nL i d not. A s shown in the figure, the mercury pump initial speed reyuireincnt increased by approximately a factor of 2 in going from a\n145-second ramp to a 30-second ramp. The battely power required\nto drive the pump a t the higher speed would increase by a factor of 8.\n\nFor the mercury pump alone, the power involved would be small,\nand the factor of 8 would not be significant. For sinlplicity, however,\nall pumps of the system should have a common anxiliary power supply and tun at the same lnitial speed. For this reason, the factor of\n8 beconies important.\nAs already mentioned, the transient imposed on the reactor i s\nthe second factor that tends to dictate a nunimum linut for the duration of the mercury flow ramp. When the mercury flow is raniped to\nthe self-sustaining level in a shor-t time, heat i s extracted suddenly\nfrom the boiler and, therefore, the temperature of the NaK entering\nthe reactor may drop too quicldy. Consequently, the rate of change\nof reactor inlet temperature i s an important startup constraint. An\nexcessive temperature change in a short time interval could cause\nundesireable thermal stressing of the fuel elcments. The effect of\nramp duration on lnaximum temperature change in 10 seconds a t the\nreactor simnlator inlet i s shoxvn in Fig. 8. There was a definite increase of the temperature change a s ramp duration was decreased.\nThe startups using a 30-second ramp had an average 10-second temperature change that was about twice a s large a s the change for the\n140-second ramp. Still, the average temperature change for the 30second ramp was well below the reactor constraint shown by the\ndashed line. The increase in the temperature change became steeper\nwhen the durations became l e s s than about 90 seconds. For ramp\ndurations of about 90 seconds the value of the temperature change in\n10 seconds was a factor of 3 from the reactor constraint. A more\ndetailed discussion of the reactor loop transients obtained in the t e s t\nprogram i s presented in Ref. 8.\nSelection of ramp. - In selecting the niercury flow r a m p duration\nf o r the bootstrap operation, consideration must be given to the niaximum limit associated with the turbine power margin and the consequences of baclung off too f a r from this limit. It has been shown that\na penalty i s paid in battery power required for the pumps a s the ramp\ntime i s decreased Another consequence of the shorter ramps i s the\nincrease in the reactor t e ~ n p e ~ a t urate of change. F o r convenience,\nre\nthe trade-offs involved i n selecting the ramp duration a r e shown together i n Fig. 9. F r o m Fig. 9, i t can be seen that ranip durations\ni n the range of 80 to 100 seconds provide almost the steady-state\nvalue of turbine power margin and require relatively low battery\npower for the pumps. With ramps i n this range, the n m i m u m tenlperature change a t the reactor simulator inlet i n a 10-second interval\nprovides a safety factor of 3 from the constraining value for the\nreactor.\nCondenser pressure control. - Another important consideration\ni n the bootstrapping of the system to the self-sustained condition is\nthe buildup and stabilization of the condensing pressure. Associated\nwith the self-sustaining level of mercury flow i s an upper limit of\ncondenser pressure, since this pressure i s the turbine baclc pressure.\nDuring the mercury flow ramp, the pressure must not build up towards this limit too quickly, o r the turbine acceleration will be impeded. A lower limit also exists, once the injection process ends,\nsince then, in zero gravity, the pump suction p r e s s u r e i s essentially\nequal to the condenser pressure. Unless the suction pl-essure i s\nsome amount ahove the mercury vapor pressure, the pump will cavi-tate and fail to produce the self-sustaining flow. Because of these\nlimits a condenser p r e s s u r e control i s used i n the startup.\nThe control concept i s shown i n Fig. 10. The lower sketch shows\nthe mercury flow ramp to the self-sustaining level. The upper slcetch\nshows the allowable corridor for the condenser p r e s s u r e a s prescribed by the requirements in turbine back p r e s s u r e and pump suction pressure. The cross-hatched a r e a s represent the unacceptable\nvalues. The control i s a deadband type. Corrective action i s taken\nwhenever the pressure goes outside the deadband indicated by the\ndashed lines i n the allowable corridor. The corrective action i s\nshown in the middle slcetch and consists of ramping the condenser\ncoolant flow upwards when the pressure i s ahove the deaclband and\ndownwards when the pressure i s below the deadband. The control i s\nnot allowed to operate during the initial buildup of the pressure into\nthe deadband. Instead, a n initial flow of coolant i s used to govern the\nl a t e of this buildup.\nDuring the test program, the capability of the control was investigated for various values of the control parameters and f o r variations\nin the startup procedures which subjected the control to extreme condenser transients. The testing showed that deadbands a s small a s\n\n2 psi could be used without excessive oscillations oi the p i e s s u r e provided tlle ramp rate of the coolant flow was low. With this ramp rate\nlow, however, initial overshoot of the deadhancl anrl, hence, high turbine back pressure was a problem for some sta.rtups. The ove~.shoot\nproblem was corrected by doubling the speed of the coolant flow ramp\nto a value of about 30 percent of rated NaIC flo\\v p e r minute. With\nthis higher rate, deadbands of 3 o r 4 psi were required for good stability. The zero-gravity requirement for pump suction pressure was\nsatisfied by using initial coolant flows belov: about 15 percent of the\nrated value.\n\nThe perfovmance of the contro! during extreme condenser tiansients i s illustrated i n Figs. 1 and 12. I11 the startup of Fig. 11the\n1\nnrercury flow was ramped up to the self-suslaiuing level in 30 sec-.\nonds rather than in the preferred time of 80 to 100 seconds. In the\nstartup of Fig. 1 2 more than twice tlle design value of liquid mercury\nwas allo\\ved to accul~lulate the condenser before injection was\nin\nstopped. For both startups, the pressure response was satisfactory\nin regards to initial overshoot, oscillation, and pressure a t the end\nof injection. Tests such a s these showed that the control could cope\nwith a wide range of conditions in the bootstrap operation.\n\nant flow; tlie maximum flow limit of the heat-rejection loop was\nreached. The pressure, therefore, increased further.\nThese two problems could be corrected to allow use of a 500-second power ramp. A variable ramp rate in coolant flow could be built\ninto the condenser pressure control to allow it to cope with both the\nbootstrap operation and a fast power ramp. And the transient flow\ncapacity of the heat rejection loop could be made g r e a t e r than what i s\nrequired for the steady-state rated power operation of the system.\nHowever, when the disadvantages of control complexity and increased\npunlping power a r e considered, the more attractive solution i s to slow\ndown the mercury-flow power ramp.\nA 900-second power ramp i s shown i n Fig. 16. For this ramp in\nmercury flow, the control had tlie same coolant-flow ramp \'ate a s in\nthe previous figure. Of course, i t also had the s a m e maximum flow\nlimitation. Both were sufficient for the 900-second power ramp. The\ncondenser pressure was maintained within the deadband throughout the\ntransient. Additional data and discussion related to the power ranip\na r e included i n Ref. 10.\nSummary of Results\n\nPower Ramp\n\n-\n\nStabilization time.\nEarly startup concepts for the SNAP-8 syst e m called for the mercury flow ramp to the rated power level to begin very shortly (100 to 200 sec) after the ramp to the self-sustaining\nlevel. The basis of this concept was to take advantage of the initial,\ntransient surge i n reactor power. More recently, however, planning\nf o r potential missions has shown that the probable configuration of a\nflight-type system would include a stand-by power conversion system\ncoupled to the same reactor. With such a configuration, the transient\ncharacteristics of the reactor\'s power surge would be dependent on\nwhich power conversion system was being started. Therefore the\ntransient matching of the power ramp in mercury flow to the reactorts\nresponse i s impractical. The current concept i s to wait until the\ntransients in the reactor loop have died out before begimdng the power\nramp.\nAn indication of the length of time required for this stabilization\nis illustrated in Fig. 13. The \'eactor loop transients a r e diminished\nafter the f i r s t cycle of power or temperature. The system i s almost\nsteady after the second cycle. It i s important to realize that the stabilization time needed f o r a flight system may be different than that\nindicated by the ground-based tests. The differences could be due to\nchanges in the reactor loop heat capacity or to changes in the reactor\ntemperature coefficients of reactivity. The coefficients used in the\nsimulator were the coefficients determined in t e s t s of the latest reactor, the SNAP-8 Development Reactor. Coefficients expected for a\nflight reactor would provide closer control of temperature and, thus,\ntend to allow shorter stabilization time.\nEffect of ramp duration - Once stabilization i s achieved the system i s ramped to full power operation. Figure 14 shows reactor simulator transients during a 500-second ramp to full power operation.\nI t i s apparent that the changes a r e occurring almost on a quasi-steady\nstate basis. The curves a r e smooth between self-sushining power\noperation and full-power operation. The niinor i r r e g ~ ~ l a r i t i e s the\nin\npower and outlet tenlpera.ture traces a r e due to the siniulated reactor\ncontrol steps. The reactor could easily tolerate a ramp duration of\n500 seconds o r longer. With improved temperatore coefficients of\nreactivity, even shorter power ramp durations would be compatible\nwith the load-foilowing capabilities of the reactor.\nProblems in condenser pressure control, however, were encountered in the 500-second power ramp. As shown by the condenser\np r e s s u r e plot in Fig. 15, these problems began a t about 360 seconds\n: ~ i the ramp, Up to this time, corrective actions of the control had\no\nC~:"ri.tid condenser pressure back into the deadband whenever it exthe\n:-ii*ded die upper limit. The stepwise increase io the coolant flow\nh c i ~ :t,his time indicates that the control was operating correctly.\n~\n2 i i i c . r 360 seconds, however, the pressure remained ahove the deadLriiii r v a i rhougii the control rarnped the coolant fl-v upwards in a\ncoii~nuous\nmanner. This situation indicates the raiilp rate of the control was too small for the 500-second power ramp even though i t was\nsci close to the optimum value for tilt? biiillstl-ap operation discussed\nIj,.O :. . iolisly. Another problem is evicierit ncar" the end of tile ramp.\nA t ;ij,oilt 450 sccor?ds, the coni~,o!!osl its ability to increase the coo!-\n\nOne hundred thirty-five startup tests were conducted on a SNAP8 power conversion system coupled with a reactor simulator. Both\nthe relatively fast transient to a self-sustained condition and tlie gradua! transient that achieves rated power were investigated. The investigations have shown that satisfactoiy startup of the power conversion system can be ensured with procedures that will t r e a t the reactor very gently.\nThe more specific results of the testing a r e a s follows:\n1. Startup to the self-sustained level was successfully accomplished with mercury flow \'amps up to a maximum limit of 145 seconds in duration. The turbine power margin, however, for acceleration of the brbine-alternator and pumps to rated speed was larger f o r\nshorter ramps. Ramp durations of 80 to 100 seconds provided substantial margin and still caused minimal reactor loop transients. The\nshort-term temperature change a t the inlet of the reactor simulator\nwas only about 1/3 of the specified acceptable value f o r the reactor.\n2. A simple deadband control of condenser p r e s s u r e effectively\ncoped with a wide range of condenser conditions during the transient\nto self-sustained operation. The control i s \'equired to limit turbine\nback pressure and maintain adequate mercury pump suction pressure.\n\n3. A 500-second mei-cury flow ramp from the self-sustaining\nlevel to the rated-power level was very compatible with reactorsimulator load-following capabilities. In fact, reactor simulator temperatures indicated the change in operating point was almost quasisteady. The 500-second ramp, however, exceeded the capability of\nthe condenser pressure control a s optimized for the f i r s t phase of\nstartup. Slowing the power ramp down to 900 seconds enabled the\ncontrol to perform satisfactorily without complicating changes in the\ncontrol.\n\nReferences\n1 Code, C.
