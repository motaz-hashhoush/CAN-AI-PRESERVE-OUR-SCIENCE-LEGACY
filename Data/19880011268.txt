Chan\nUNISYS Corporation\nHuntsville, Alabama\n\nSUMMARY\nA significant speed improvement in processing NASTRAN bulk data cards, in\nthe order of 10 to 40 times faster, has been achieved, as compared to COSMIC\n1986 and 1987 NASTRAN releases. This improvement is directly proportional to\nthe NASTRAN problem size. The improvement represents typically a 20% to 35%\nsavings of time and cost on a normal NASTRAN job. In this project, a new\nXSORT2 module was written to replace the original XSORT module, which handles\nall the bulk data cards, and the old bulk data cards from the OPTP file. The\nXREAD routine that reads the input bulk data cards from the system input\nstream required major changes.\nThe RCARD routine that interprets all\ncharacters in an input card and determines their type (BCD, numeric, or\nblanks) required minor changes for improved efficiency. Although the RCARD\nroutine is not used in XSORT2, its changes increase the efficiency of the\nInput File Processor (IFP) module, which contributes to the overall efficiency\nof NASTRAN LINK 1, where the speed timing is checked.\n\nXSORT2 is a completely new module with completely new logic, a new\nsorting technique, a new filing system, and a new data base management method.\nIt bears no resemblance to the original XSORT module, and does not use any of\nthe original supporting routines. However, it does the same job with the same\nresult much faster and better. (The original XSORT did fail in several test\ncases. For example, multi-level of restarts with delete cards did not work\nproperly).\nXSORT2 also uses new logic to handle a large number of\ncontinuation cards efficiently, while the original XSORT is known to handle\nthis situation poorly and to be very time consuming.\nThe XSORT2 source\nprogram, written in machine independent Fortran, is much easier to read and to\nunderstand.\nAll bit and byte shiftings, word maskings, and character\nmanipulations are kept to a minimum.\nThe new XSORT2 module has been thoroughly field tested. It is now a\ndefault module in the COSMIC 1988 NASTRAN release, replacing the less\nefficient XSORT module.\nHowever, the XSORT2 is actually installed in the\nCOSMIC version in parallel with the original XSORT module. A user can invoke\nthe original XSORT module by simply including a "DIAG 42" card in his NASTRAN\ninput deck.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA NASTRAN job usually consists of an input phase of data processing,\nfollowed by a computational phase. The input data processing normally falls\ninto three categories - the processing of the Executive Control cards, the\nCase Control cards, and the bulk data cards. A fourth category is required\nonly if sub-structuring is requested.\nThe Executive Control cards are\nprocessed by the Input File Processor, Part 1 (IFP1). The Case Control cards\nare handled by the Executive Case Control Processor (XCSA).\nThe bulk data\ncards are processed by the XSORT module (Executive Bulk Data Card Sort), which\nreads and sorts the input bulk data deck. The input cards to the Executive\nand Case Control are completely free-field, and ordering independent. The\nbulk data cards are ordering independent and can be in fixed-field or freefield formats.\nThis paper concerns only the bulk data cards, and the\nsignificant speed improvement.\nAll NASTRAN input cards are read into NASTRAN by the XREAD routine, which\ncalls FFREAD to do the actual card reading from the system input stream. The\nfollowing are the tasks that the XSORT module must handle when it processes a\nnew bulk data card coming from XREAD:\nFree-field vs. fixed-field format;\nSingle-field vs. double-field cards;\nCold-start vs. re-start;\nModified vs. unmodified restart;\nRestart with or without delete;\nSorted and/or unsorted echoes, and punch;\nContinuation cards and their parent cards;\nMachine dependency, various word sizes, and word architectures;\nSmall vs. large input deck (where computer memory space is limited\nto handle all or part of the input cards in a single pass);\nData sorting and merge;\nMixed BCD and numeric data on input cards, and on output listing; and\nUser error checks, and error messages.\n\nThe input to NASTRAN can be considered quite user-friendly. User\'s\nerrors will be flagged and messages printed out, but a NASTRAN job will not be\nterminated prematurely.\nHowever, it is not an easy matter internally to\nhandle all the generous and flexible capabilities that NASTRAN allows during\nthe input data processing phase. The complexity of the tasks involved can be\ngauged by the supporting subroutines that the XSORT module uses, which are\nlisted below.\nXREAD\nXRECPS\nRPAGE\nINITCO\nXFADJ\nXBCDBI\nXPRETY\n\n- calls FFREAD to read the input cards, in free-field or\nfixed-field formats;\n- positions the continuation cards to proper records;\n- a special page control routine;\n- initializes machine dependent masks and constants;\n- calls XFADJl to adjust four character fields left or right,\ntwo or four fields at a time;\n- converts BCD characters to binary integers for sorting;\n- "pretties-ups"BCD characters, integers, and floating point\nnumbers for output printout;\n\n2\n\nCRDFLG\nEXTINT\n\n-\n\nINTEXT\nISFT\nKHRFNi\n\n-\n\nGIN0\n\n-\n\nsets card type flags for restart;\nconverts card type field from machine dependent character code\nto an internal machine independent code - a process that is\nneeded for alphanumeric sorting;\nprovides the reverse process of EXTINT;\na special shifting function for XFAJ1;\na group of four function routines for character-byte\nmanipulation; and\na group of General Input and Output routines.\n\nThe complexity of the XSORT module is further complicated by the fact\nthat the routines are highly machine sensitive, especially in the areas of bit\nand byte manipulations where different machines have different word sizes. The\ncharacter function routines, KHRFNi (i=1,2,3,4), must be used for the VAX\nmachine to bypass the word shifting and word masking difficulties (the VAX has\ndifferent computer word architecture).\nBecause of their simplicity and well\ndefined functions, the KHRFNi group of routines has been gradually migrated\ninto the source code for the other three machines (IBM, CDC, and UNIVAC).\nBefore 1985, all the KHRFNi functions were written in machine dependent\nFortran. In 1985 and thereafter, the KHRFNi functions in COSMIC N A S T W were\nstandardized and made machine independent, by the use of internal file 1/0\ntechnique.\nSOURCE OF DEFICIENCY\nThe XSORT module reads and processes the bulk data input cards either\nfrom the system input stream or from the Old Problem Tape (OPTP), and outputs\nthe information in an orderly sequence to the New Problem Tape (NPTP), to be\nprocessed later by the IFP (Input File Processor) module. XSORT processes\neach character on an input card ( 8 0 characters per card) and determines its\nproper type - BCD, blank, or numeric. The characters are then split, moved,\nre-positioned,re-combined, or substituted to form meaningful data. Since the\nraw data are initially stored in BCD form, and 4 characters per word, the\ncharacter manipulation functions, KHRFNi, or the equivalent left/right word\nshifting and word masking, are frequently employed to decode or encode the\ninformation. On average, 20 to 150 encode and decode operations are needed\nfor an input card. The machine independent versions of KHRFNl and KHRFN4\n(since 1985) are highly 1/0 bound and time consuming, and the XSORT module is\n4 to 8 times slower than the pre-1985 release. The VAX machines, heavily\nreliant on the KHRFNi routines, are greatly affected by the change made in\n1985, and the XSORT module runs relatively slower.\nNASTRAN requires all input bulk data cards to be sorted. The original\nXSORT module examines (via bit and byte manipulations) each input card by its\nfirst, second, third, and possibly up to the 9th, fields, and sets up its\nrecord position pointer, with respect to the other input cards previously\nprocessed. Each time a new input card is read in, a chain reaction of setting\nand resetting pointers follows (plus bit and byte manipulations).\nFinally,\nwhen either all the input cards are read in, or the computer available core\nspace is full, the bulk data cards, saved in the core space, are transferred\nto either a scratch file or NPTP file, in sorted order given by the pointers.\nThis method of sorting at each input card level provides a means to process a\n\n3\n\nlarge number of input cards with limited computer core space. However, it is\ndefinitely not the best way available.\ninteresting, but not necessarily the most efficient. The input cards are read\nin by XREAD, saved in the open core space, and transferred to a scratch file\n\nThe original XSORT module is also known to be very slow when a large\nnumber of continuation cards is present. The problem seems to be 1/0 bound\nagain. Another shortcoming of the original XSORT module is that it does not\nfully utilize the capability of GINO (General Input and Output package) to\nbuffer in and buffer out short blocks of data efficiently. In XSORT, each\n20-word input card image is written to a scratch file as a record (a record\ncan be from 800 to 1600 words). This original carelessness makes XSORT/GINO\n1/0 bound again, and wastes disk storage space in all machines except VAX.\n(VAX has a different GINO package.)\nNEW XSORT2 WITH NEW LOGIC\nThe first attempt to improve the original XSORT module was to plug the\nholes where time is slipping out. This requires great understanding of the\nsource program, including some sections of the source code poorly written or\npoorly documented and hard to understand. Difficulties were also encountered\nin many machine dependent areas involving word maskings, left and right word\nshiftings, word size, and bit and byte operations. It was finally realized\nthat it was easier to write a completely new module to replace the original\nXSORT. New logic, new techniques, and new methods can be applied freely to the\nnew product without fears of crashing with some existing old source code.\nThe new XSORT2 module is machine independent. It completely avoids the\ncharacter manipulation routines KHRFNi.\nIn fact, it does not use the old\nXRECPS, RPAGE, INITCO, XFADJ/XRADJl, XBCDBI, XPRETY, CRDFLG, EXTINT, INTEXT,\nand ISFT supporting routines. The unsorted bulk data card echo is now moved\nto FFREAD where the card is actually read in from the system input stream.\nXSORT2 takes full advantage of the data already left adjusted (good for sorted\nbulk data echo) coming from FFREAD if the bulk data is in free-field format.\n4\n\nIf the bulk data is in fixed-field form, XW left adjusts all input fields\nR\nif and only if it is called by XSORT2. Since in XREAD the input raw data are\navailable in both BCD form and character format, XREAD converts part of the\nbulk data into their equivalent internal numeric codes, a prerequisite for\nalphanumeric sorting (done in XSORT2). The XREAD routine also informs XSORT2\nof the current input card type - regular bulk data, comment, restart delete,\ncontinuation, or an ENDDATA card. (This task was previously done by XSORT).\nThe new XSORT2 uses only two additional subroutines for support services:\nSORT2K\n\n-\n\nBISLC2\n\n-\n\n(An existing in-core sorting routine) to sort table by two\nkey words, and\nA new routine similar to BISLOC, to search an entry of two\nkeys in a given table.\n\nXSORT2 loads all input cards in their card image forms, and their\ncorresponding equivalent internal numeric codes, into the open core, except\ncomment, continuation, and delete cards. At the end (either the open core is\nfull, or an ENDDATA card is read) XSORT2 calls SORT2K to sort the cards in\ncore, then save them all in one GINO record to a scratch file. This process\nis repeated until all input cards are read and processed. XSORT2 allows up to\n30 scratch files to be used to receive incoming data. (For practical reasons,\nonly up to 1 7 files can be used.) The continuation cards and delete cards are\nsaved separately in two different scratch files.\n\nIf more than 10 scratch files are used in the above process, a 2-to-1\nfile merge follows. If more than 1 7 files are employed, a 3-to-1 file merge\nis done before final file merging and the creation of the NPTP file. This\npre-merging of files is intended to save buffer space during the final file\nmerge.\nHowever, if the number of continuation cards is within manageable\nsize, this pre-merging of files is not needed.\nBefore the final merging of all scratch files, the entire core space is\nallocated to hold as many continuation cards as possible. The final file\nmerge involves merging of all scratch files simultaneously and the insertion\nof the continuation cards to their designated parents, to form the NPTP file.\nTo be consistent with the rest of NASTRAN program requirements, each input\ncard image to NPTP is written as a 20-word short record. Before this final\nmerging, however, all GINO files are written in large blocks (as large as the\nworking space in the open core can hold). Finally, a check is made for any\nunused continuation cards. User\'s warning messages are printed out if they\nexist.\nAppendix A gives a step by step description of the method used in the new\nXSORT2 module. It gives more detail about the open core space usage, the OPTP\nfile, the pre-merging and final merging of the scratch files, the setting of\nthe restart flag, and the redundant unused continuation cards.\nCONCLUSION\n\nl\n1\n\nThe original XSORT module is slow, inefficient, wasteful of disk space,\nand makes NASTRAN LINK 1 costly to run. The new XSORT2 is ultra efficient,\nand is 10 to 40 times faster (as compared to 86/87 COSMIC NASTRAN release).\n\n5\n\nThe new XSORT2 module has been field tested in all four machines (IBM,\nCDC, VAX, and UNIVAC).\nAll 119 NASTRAN standard demonstration problems ran\nsuccessfully with the new module. Other tests designed to check out restart\nand substructuring also ran successfully. A few tests with intentional input\nerrors stopped at the end of LINK 1, and proper error messages were echoed out\ncorrectly. A few tests with large input decks, 8,000 to 15,000 cards and\n1,500 to 2,500 continuation cards, ran very fast. The speed improvements can\nbe translated into some 2 to 5 times faster if they were to be compared to the\npre-85 NASTRAN releases. The new XSORT2 module makes LINK 1 run noticeably\nfaster when NASTRAN is run interactively.\n\nThe XSORT2 module is now installed in the COSMIC 1988 NASTRAN release,\nreplacing the less efficient XSORT module.\nIt is presently installed in\nparallel with the original XSORT module, and a user can invoke the old XSORT\nmodule by simply including a "DIAG 42" card in his NASTRAN input deck.\nThe new XSORT2 and the original XSORT modules are completely\ninterchangeable - that is, XSORT2 can work with the bulk data deck coming from\nan OPTP tape, which is generated by XSORT, and vice versa.\n\n6\n\n1\n\nI,\n\nI\n~\n\nAPPENDIX A\n(To be inserted in the NASTEUN Programmer\xe2\x80\x99s\nManual following pages 4.4-1 through 4.4-11.)\n\n7\n\nEXECUTIVE PREFACE MODULE XSORT2 (EXECUTIVE BULK DATA CARD SORT)\n\n4.4\n\nEXECUTIVE PREFACE MODULE XSORT2 (EXECUTIVE BULK DATA CARD SORT)\n\n4.4.1\n\nENTRY POINT:\n\n4.4.2\n\nI\n\nPurpose\n\nXSORT2\n\nI\n\ne\nThe function of XSORT2 i s t o prepare a f i l e on t h e N w Problem Tape\ncontaining t h e s o r t e d bulk d a t a .

On the third pass, scratch5 is used, and so on. For practical\nreasons, up to 17 scratch files can be used, which gives a capacity of roughly\n35,000 input cards if an open core space of 50k words is used. The capacity\nis directly proportional to the available open core space. (The XSORT2 source\ncode actually allows up to 30 scratch files.)\nStep 3. If this is an unmodified restart run with no delete card and no\nnew bulk data card, the bulk data cards in OPTP are read and transferred to\nthe NPTP file. The rest of the XSORT2 operation is skipped.\nStep 4. If this is a modified restart with delete, the work area in core\nis loaded with the delete ranges from scratchl. Scratch1 is closed and\nreopened for reuse. The bulk data cards are moved from OPTP to scratchl with\ncards deleted as specified by the delete ranges. The deleted cards, or\nparents of the deleted continuation cards are flagged for restart operation.\nIf this is a modified restart, with or without delete, all continuation cards\nfrom OPTP are transferred to the continuation file, scratch2. These\ncontinuation cards from OPTP are marked so that in final file merging in Step\n9 , their parents will be flagged for restart operation.\nStep 5. This pre-merge step is needed only when (a) more than 10 scratch\nfiles are used in Step 2, and (b) the open core space is not big enough to\nhold simultaneously all continuation cards, GINO buffers, and scratch working\narrays. If Step 2 uses 10 to 17 scratch files, every other two files (2-to-1)\nare merged to form a new file. If more than 17 files are used in Step 2, a\n3-to-1 file merge is used. The total number of scratch files that contain\ninput data is now reduced to n. If this pre-merge step is skipped, n is the\noriginal number of scratch files used in step 2 .\nStep 6 .\n\nn in Step 5 is increased by 1 if this is a restart run.\n\nStep 7. The open core in /ZZXSRT/ is reaccessed. It is now divided into\nn GINO buffers, n 24-word arrays, a table area, and a data area. The table\narea must be big enough to hold the first 2 words of all the continuation\ncards plus a pointer for each card. The data area must hold at lease 300\ncontinuation card images (minus the first 2 words each) to make XSORT2\nefficient.\nStep 8 . The table area and the data area in Step 7 is loaded with the\ncontinuation card data previously saved in scratch2. The first 2 words plus a\npointer are saved in the table, and the remaining card image is saved in the\ndata area in a location corresponding to the pointer. When the data area is\nfull, this entire data area is copied as one block of records to a new scratch\nfile. Loading of the continuation cards into the table area and the data area\nis repeated if needed. (If the data area is big enough to hold all the\ncontinuation cards, no new scratch file is generated.) When scratch2 is\nexhausted, the in-core sorter, SORT2K, is called to sort the table\nStep 9 . All the scratch files that hold the bulk data cards, and if\napplicable, the scratchl file that holds the OPTP data, are ready for final\nfile merge. A record of each file is loaded into one of the n 24-word arrays\n\n9\n\nEXECUTIVE PREFACE MODULE XSORT2 (EXECUTIVE BULK DATA CARD SORT)\nin an orderly sequence. By comparing the last 4 words of each of the n arrays\n(these are the 4 internal numeric code words), the first 20 words of the\nsmallest array are written out to NPTP. The array is then replenished by the\nnext record from the same scratch file. If the record just written out to\nNPTP specifies a continuation card, the continuation table is searched via the\nBISLC2 routine, and the continuation card is picked up from the continuation\nwork area, or from the new continuation scratch file. If the continuation\ncard originated from OPTP, the parent card in NPTP must be flagged for restart\noperation. The continuation card in the continuation table is now marked as\n"used". Step 9 is repeated until all scratch files are exhausted.\nStep 10. This final step checks and prints any continuation cards that\nare left "not used". The continuation cards of a "not used" continuation card\nare marked off to avoid redundant messages.\n4.4.5 Subroutines\n4.4.5.1 Subroutine Name:\n\nXREAD\n\n1. Entry Point: XREAD\n2. Purpose: It reads an input card, and left-adjusts all fields. If\nXREAD is called by XSORT2 (the 5th word in labeled common /XECHOX/ is\nnon-zero), it converts the first three input fields (plus the 4th or 5th\nfield in some card types) to a set of 4 internal numeric codes, that can\nbe used for sorting. These 4 coded words are saved in labeled common\n/XSORTX/. XREAD calls FFREAD to actually read an input card from the\nsystem input stream. The input card can be in fixed-field or free-field\nformat.\n3. Calling Sequence: CALL XREAD (*n,BUF) See subroutine XREAD for more\ndetails.\n4.4.5.2 Subroutine Name:\n\nSORT2K\n\n1. Entry Point: SORT2K, A secondary entry point in SORT, an in-core\nsorter\n2. Purpose: It sorts a table by first 2 key words.\n3. Calling Sequence: CALL SORT2K (O,O,Nl,N2,TABLE,LEN)\nSee subroutine\nSORT for more details.\n4.4.5.3 Subroutine Name:\n\nBISLC2\n\n1. Entry Point: BISLC2\n2. Purpose: Binary search to position a double word in a table using the\nfirst entry. (Same function as BISLOC, which is a single word search)\n3. Calling Sequence:\nCALL BISLC2 (*nl,ID,ARR,LEN,KN,JLOC)\nWhere: nl\n- Nonstandard return if ID is not found in the first entry\nin ARR\n- Integers to locate as first double word of entry - two\nID\nintegers in ID(1) and ID(2) - input\nARR - Table to search - input\n\n10\n\nMODULE F\'UNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS\n\nLEN\n\n-\n\nKN\n\n-\n\nJLOC\n\ni\n\n4.4.6\n\nNumber of words in each entry of the array ARR - integer\ninput\nNumber of entries in AFU - integer - input\nInteger pointer to location of first double word in the\nentry.\n\n-\n\nDesign Requirements\n\n1. Data cards operated upon by XSORT2 must conform to the NASTRAN format\nfor bulk data cards (ten eight-character fields per card for fixed-field\ninput, or all fields separated by comma or blanks for free-field input).\nSee section 2 of the User\'s Manual for details.\n2. Data cards must contain only valid BCD key punch codes or blanks.\nNonstandard multi-punched code (e.g., some IBM EBCDIC) will cause\nunpredictable results.\n3.\n\nFor IBM machine only, data cards can be punched in EBCDIC or BCD\n\n4.\n\nXSORT2 requires sufficient open core to contain three GINO buffers and\na work buffer for at least 200 data cards (each data card requires\ntwenty-five core locations). However, for a large input deck (15,000\ncards or more, and a large number of continuation cards) up to 11 GINO\nbuffers may be needed.\n5. The continuation cards must fit into the core work area during final\nfile merge. Each continuation card requires three core locations.\n6 . XSORT2 logic is not biased toward input that is already sorted. An\nultra fast in-core sorter is used for input card preparation. The\nintermediate (if needed) and the final file merges are ultra efficient.\n7 . During initial input card preparation and for practical reasons,\nXSORT2 is limited to 20 scratch files. 17 of these files are used to\nstore input card images. The number of card images per file is n, where\n\nn\n\n=\n\n((available open core space)\n\n-\n\n3*(GINO\n\nbuffers)) / 25.\n\nAt this initial preparation stage, only three GINO buffers are used.\n4.4.7\n\nI\n1\n\nDiagnostic Messages\n\nXSORT2 can produce two categories of diagnostic messages. The first are\ntermed USER messages and deal with bulk data card errors. The second are\ntermed SYSTEM messages, which are generally fatal in nature and indicate\nserious 1/0 malfunctions.\nXSORT2 message numbers include 201 through 216. All messages are listed\nand explained in section 6 of the User\'s manual.\n\nI\n\n11\n\nEXPERIENCES WITH A NASTRAN TRAINER\n\nB\nY\n\nH. Grooms, P. Hinz, and K. Cox\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEngineers entering today\xe2\x80\x99s world have a fundamental theoretical understanding of the finite element\nmethod but have virtually no practical experience with it. The difference between understanding the theoretical\nfoundations of the finite element method and analyzing a real structure using a computer program can be substantial. The NASTRAN Trainer was developed to address the latter issue.\nMany researchers (ref. 1, 2, 3, 5 ) have addressed the development of user-friendly finite element analysis\nand design tools, but training engineers to use these tools is still an issue. Sadd and Rolph (ref. 6 ) concluded that\ntraining engineers in the use of the finite element method could be accomplished by any of three ways:\n\n1 . Using traditional university training\n2. Utilizing the increasing number of specialized seminars and short courses offered in finite element\nanalysis\n\n3. Developing a tailored in-house training program\nSadd and Rolph took the third option and established a 28-hour course (4 hours per week for 7 weeks).\nGrooms, Merriman, and Hinz (ref. 4) presented the concept of a NASTRAN Trainer as an automated\nmethod for familiarizing engineers with applying the finite element method to structural analysis problems. The\nNASTRAN Trainer is one of the functional elements in the system shown in figure 1 . The documentation module of this system is completely functional, while the adviser (used for debugging models) is in the test stage.\nThis paper will explain the following:\n\n1 . The organization of the NASTRAN Trainer\n2. Contents of the Trainer\n\n3. Steps that a user follows\n\n4. Users\xe2\x80\x99 observations and suggestions\n5 . Plans for other applications\n\n12\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n1\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nORGANIZATION AND PURPOSE OF THE TRAINER\n\nThe Trainer was developed as a stand-alone tool that an engineer could use at his own convenience and\npace. The system was designed so that the user would need very little knowledge of the job control language or\nthe operating system before he could sit down at a terminal and solve an example problem.\nThe Trainer is organized into three main modules: (1) Overview, (2) User\xe2\x80\x99s Guide, and (3) Problem Set.\nFigure 2 shows some of the details of each module. The user accesses these modules by using the primary menu.\nMore details of the \xe2\x80\x9cNASTRAN Environment\xe2\x80\x9d sections are given in figure 3.\nThe typical sequence of events for a user is shown in figure 4. The Trainer has been planned so that it is\nvery easy for a first-time user to get started on an example problem.\n\nCONTENTS OF THE TRAINER\n\nI\n\nI\n\nTen example problems are contained in the Trainer. These examples and their salient features are summarized in table I. The problems, which range from a statically determinate, two-dimensional truss to a ringstiffened cylindrical tank, are shown in figures 5 through 14.\n\nUSER EXPERIENCES\n\n1\nI\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nI\n\ni\n\nSince 1986, approximately 65 engineers have used the NASTRAN Trainer. The majority of these users\nwere new graduates who had taken one or more finite element courses in school but who had almost no actual\nexperience with NASTRAN. These users typically went through the set of ten problems in two months while\nalso performing their regular work. Approximately 20 engineers were surveyed by use of the questionaire shown\nin table 11. The percentages shown in the table indicate the responses. By using the program, the average user\nreduced his training time from 135 hours to 60.\nMany of the comments were directed to the NASTRAN documentation. The comments made about particular example problems are being used to modify and improve the Trainer. The users\xe2\x80\x99 consensus was that the\nTrainer is a useful and effective tool that should be expanded.\n\nEXTENSIONS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS\n\nI\n\nI\n~\n\nThe ten example problems that are currently in the Trainer were chosen to familiarize the novice user with\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nj\n\n1. Bar and rod elements\n\n2. Beam elements\n3. Geometric symmetry\n\n4. Loading symmetry and antisymmetry\n5 . Boundary conditions and stability constraints\n\n13\n\nI\n\n6. Plate elements\n7. Plane stress\n8. Grid fineness\n9. Temperature and loading\n10. Three-dimensional considerations\n\nThe substructuring module would deal with\nSingle versus multiple level\nSequence of joining substructures\nData handling\nI\n\nThe normal modes analysis module would cover\nReduction of stiffness matrices\nReduction of mass matrices\nAccuracy considerations\nDynamic response\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe NASTRAN Trainer has demonstrated that it is an efficient and effective training tool as well as an aid\n\nI\n\nto productivity improvement.\n\n1\nREFERENCES\n1.

Rue to the importance of its applications, a\nnumber of commercial packages have been written to implement the method and to make\nit available for engineering applications. Examples of such packages are Cosmic\nNastran, MSC/Nastran, ANSYS etc. These packages are typically very large, very\nexpensive, and require powerful and expensive computers.\nUse of a finite-element analysis package requires highly trained engineers,\npossessing not only expertise in their professional area but also possessing\nknowledge of the inner structure of the software package. Further, this knowledge\nmust be coupled with awareness of assumptions underlying the finite-element method\nimplementation.\nWith continued tumbling of computer hardware costs, and concomitant reductions in\nsoftware costs, it is the availability of such highly trained personnel that poses a\nbarrier t o widespread use of finite-element analysis.\nThis paper describes some aspects of our research project intended to make a breach\nin this barrier by constructing a knowledge based finite element wplications\nconsulting and training ustern (FEATS). The ultimate goal of FEATS is to test the\nproposed theories necessary to describe the functions of an intelligent system\nconsultant and teacher in a finite element training environment. FEATS will be\nimplemented on the TI EXPLORER LX. It will reside on the Explorer processor: the\nCOSMIC NASTRAN finite-element package will reside on the LX side ( an M68020\nprocessor).\nThe pragmatic aims of FEATS are to create an interface to a Finite Element Package\nto offer intelligent features for control and interrogation of the underlying finite\nelement system, as well as facilities for effective training of personnel in the use\nof the system resources. To perform its consulting/training functions FEATS will\ncommunicate in natural language and will use models of the user\'s knowledge, of the\nconversation, and of the domain. (The natural language interface is adopted from\nOSCAT [Bykat, 19861 .)\nTEE PROBLEM.\n\nIntimate knowledge of a sophisticated package requires a great deal of training, and\nmany hours of practice coupled with the constant availability of a patient "guru".\nUnfortunately, whereas the novice user is (usually) willing to allocate the time\n\n21\n\'\n\nneeded, and to put up with the training required, the guru is frequently not\navailable and often is not at all patient.\n\n\'\n\nA novice user, and indeed a more advanced one, may be easily discouraged by the\nconstant need of experimentation which is frequently the only major alternative open\nas a complement to the very few hours at which the teacher is available. Indeed such\nan experimentation results also in a very inefficient utilization of human\nresources.\n\nI\n\n1\n\nManuals, be it on-line or not, are valuable but only as one of training options;\nthey are of little merit when available as the only training tool. Using the online, or the hard copy, reference manual, the novice user is faced with masses of\ninformation to scan through. (For example, NASTRAN documentation has already over\n8,500 pages! 1 Yet, frequently, the same information could be offered in \'no time\'\nby an expert consultant. Furthermore, to avail himself even of this avalanche of\nfacts, he must be sufficiently trained to be able to index his query with a correct\nkeyword: incorrect keyword might at best retrieve no information at all, though more\nfrequently it will simply swamp the user with irrelevant facts.\n\nI\n\nCustomer service and \'hot lines\' provided with expensive packages are helpful, but\nwhen used they do disrupt the application training process, turning frequently into\ndiscouragingly long procedures.\nTOWARDS A SOLUTION\n\n1\n\n-\n\nA WISH LIST.\n\nAs a consequence of such a situation, the need for an automated consulting system\ncapable of training, answering, and explaining its answers to questions about the\nusage of the underlying system (and its domain) becomes apparent.\nTo be effective, the system should be unobtrusive, should support a mixed initiative\ndialogue, and should be able to measure the apprenticeship level of the student.\nSuch a measure can then be used to choose a level of interaction which is\nappropriate to that particular student.\nI\n\nThe system should also perform various other functions related to its consulting,\ntraining, and management of the underlying hardware roles. These functions require a\n.model of the user (capturing his knowledge), a model of the machine (resources\navailable), a model of the domain (FEP), and a model of the dialogue.\n\nI\n\nI1\nI\n\nThe capabilities of training functions to be investigated fall within the area of\nopen problems in design of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Much of the work in this\nfield concentrates on construction of student models. Notable examples are GUIDON\nWMPUS [Goldstein, 19821 , SOPHIE I,II,\nI11 [Brown, 19821, and BUGGY\n[Clancey, 19821\n[Burton, 19783. Our work differs in the theories proposed. The main differences lie\nin the mechanism of knowledge collection and the calculus adopted for evaluation of\nthe students knowledge and misconceptions.8\n\nA natural language interface is a requirement of great importance. .Such interface,\nwhenever appropriate, should use the graphics facilities offered by the system, to\nenhance the interaction with the user. This is of particular relevance in a finite\nelement and training environment. In such applications, the expressive power of\ngraphics input/output is a necessity.\n\na\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nOF POOR QUmm\n\n22\n\nI\n\nTOWARDS A SOLUTION\n\n-\n\nTHE FEATS PROJECT.\n\nFEATS environment will consist of the components specified in Fig.1. FEATS will\ncommunicate with the Nastran finite element package (FEP) using the \'cooperating\nprocesses\' paradigm, using direct streams as well as the shared memory protocols.\nkhen needed, the remote procedure call (RPC) protocol will be employed. All three\nethods are supported by TI EXPLORER LX hardware, which is used in development of\nFEATS.\nI\n\n\'\n\nFEATS unifies a number of cooperating modules including:\n/A.\ncommunication interface for input of user utterances and presentation of\nI\nsystems conclusions,\nI\ncontrol module for rule construction, conflict resolution and rule invocation,\nreasoning module for interpretation of possibly ill-formed user utterances ,\nselection of appropriate rules, and explanation of conclusions reached,\nID. model construction module for collection of facts and rules describing the\nuser, his machine, and his conversation,\n/E. teacher module for instruction and training of concepts and facilities\navailable under the underlying FEP system,\nI\n\n: :1\n\nThe knowledge base of the system will be programmed mostly into production rules.\nThe concept of frames, [Minsky, 1975; Bobrow, 19771, is adapted to support the\nlimplementation of the models used by FEATS. Identification of these modules imposes\n\' a hierarchical structure which will be helpful in orderly implementation of this\nlproject. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show FEATS\'S architecture; various principles of the\nabove modules are discussed below.\nI\n\nI!The OSCAT\'s\n\nCOMUNICATION INTERFACE.\n\nNL interface prototype, [Bykat, 19863, is adopted for FEATS project.\n/This interface performs as an expectation driven parser which processes each\n,sentence as an individual unit. The sentences are parsed by using a dictionary of\npredefined words. Each word defines the expectation of other words which either\nprecede it or follow it. The structure of the word definitions is fashioned after\nthe Conceptual Dependency theory, [Schank & Abelson, 19751.\nDuring parsing, the meaning of the sentences is formulated as a graph of linked word\nframes representing the semantic content of a sentence. Once the parse of the\nsentence\' has been terminated, the information acquired is then passed on to\nappropriate modules for further processing (identify goals, plan actions, generate\nresponse, etc).\nThus for example, a user utterance such as:\n\'I want to substructure this region into two parts.\'\nwill be transformed by the NL interface into:\n\nM1:\nC1:\nAl:\nN1:\nN2:\nN3:\nC1:\n\nmood(ta1k).\ngoal (actor (Ul), object (C1)1.\nmutate(actor (U1), object (El), to(E2))\nconfig(re1 (divided), object (El), object (E211\nconfig(rel(part-of), object (P1), object (E211\nconfig(rel(part-of), object(P2) , object (E211\nutter (act (All , mod1 (N1), mod2 (N2), mod3 (N3))\n\n23\n\n.ORIGINAL PAGE IS\nQUALITY\n\nOB ROOR\n\nu1:\nEl:\nE2:\nP1:\nP2:\nS1:\nS2:\n\nS3:\nS4:\n\n(user i )\nd.\np-obj (id(sl), mod(-) 1.\np-obj (id(S2), mod(-) 1.\np-obj (id(S31, mod(-) 1\np-obj (id (214) mod (-1 1 .\n,\n(description of a region).\n<description of a subdivision).\n(description of a subregion).\n(description of a subregion).\n\nI\n\n,\nI\nI\n\n% exists\n% to be described\n% to be described\n% to be described\n\ni\nI\n\nNotice the separation of the utterance into a number of concepts. Each of these 1\nconcepts can be manipulated appropriately as the current focus of conversation \'\nwarrants. Further, since these concepts are preserved, they can be referred to in\nsubsequent conversation too.\nNote also, that the main operation (action) is \'change an object\' (ie. mutate).\nWhen \'mutate\' is qualified by various nuances, it becomes \'substructure\' (eg. Nl),\n\'rotate\', \'translate\', \'shrink\', etc.\n\n,\n\nREASONING MODULE.\nThe functions of the reasoning module are concerned with selection of rules which\nare appropriate for firing (invoking) in the current context. There are frequently a\nnumber of rules suitable for selection in any given situation. Conflicts can arise \'\ndue to, the origin of two categories of rules, which are candidates for selection:\n(1) general rules inherited from the initial model of the FEATS world, and (2)\nspecific rules selected by the pending goals as implied by the user\'s utterance. The\nreasoning module resolves all conflicts that arise.\nSome of the more salient functions of this module are: goal extraction and plan\nformation. For example, the control module uses the internal representation of the\nconversation, to extract the goals and to create plans to satisfy these goals. Thus\nin the above example, the following goals will be extracted:\nFormulate instructions to mutate a region.\nExplain these instructions.\n\nI\n\nNote, how simple these important inferences are to obtain. This is achieved by a\ncareful construction of the internal representation which in turn depends on\ndictionary definitions.\nThe training and the consulting aspects of FEATS require plan building. In this\nprototype we employ a hierarchical plan construction. Once the goal of the utterance\nis understood, the first level of the plan is established. The first level is then\nrefined to produce a second level, the second level is refined to produce a level\nthird, and so on.\nRefinement of plans proceeds by invoking plan fragments which are pre-defined. On\nthe other hand, composition of the plan fragments into subplans and whole plans\ndepends entirely on the particular goal that is extracted from the utterance.\nThus, for example, for the goal "create Object", FEATS produces the following plan\n(indentation shows plan refinement):\n\n24\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nexists (Object ,new)\nmaterial (Object,Enough)\nuse-tool(create,Object)\nidentify-tool(create,Object,Tool)\nexistsfool (Too1,Id)\napply-t 001 (Id,create, Ob ject 1\nuse-method(Tool,create,Object,\ncall (Method)\n\nMethod)\n\n/ T h e interesting fact about the above plan is its generality. Thus, given the\noperation \'Operation\' (eg. create), and the object \'Object\', it requires only\ngeneral search routines for the predicate exists and material to form a general\nm o d e l for performing the Operation on the Object.\n\'The dependence on the domain of FEATS is thus isolated to specification of the Tool\n(looked up by the identify-tool predicate), discovery of the particular Tool\'s Id\n(in exists-tool predicate), and the specification of the method for using the tool\n(found by the use-method predicate). In the case of "create file" goal, these are\n\' specified in the knowledge base as:\n,\nI\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\n,\n\nfile(create,editor).\nS to create a file use editor\neditor(\'V1\').\nS \'VI\' is an editor\n\'VI\' (create,file, [vi,FID] 1.\nS to create a file using VI\nS specify command: vi <file id>\nIn addition to the above functions the reasoning module will perform, whenever\nrequested, explanation of the conclusions reached by FEATS in satisfaction of user\nposed goals. This, of course, is of major importance for the training aspect of our\nproject.\nCONTROL MODULE.\nA major function of the control module is the selection\n\nof rules applicable within\nthe current context. Since the knowledge base is expected to grow into a\nconsiderable size, a crucial pragmatic concern for this module is its search\nefficiency.\n\nTo reduce the number of rules to be searched in any given instance, the knowledge\nbase will be structured into classes of rules with each class declared as separate\nmodule. The search can then be restricted to a class of rules, subject to a\nparticular set of goals, then within the class for a subclass of rules, subject to a\nparticular subset of goals, etc. Other indexing structures will be considered.\n\n25\n\nMODEL CONSTRUCTION.\n\nI\n\nThe following models will be created and used by the system:\n(1) user model\nincludes: history of achievement, topics of deficiency, and a \'\nmeasure of apprenticeship level\n(2) domain model\nincludes: machine resources, invariants and norms of the FEP\n1\nsystem\n( 3 ) conversation model\nincludes: history of discourse, focus of current dialogue.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nI\n\nConstruction and use of these models is intended to allow processing of possibly 1\nill-formed user utterances, to select system\'s responses\nin the context of user\napprenticeship level and conversation focus, as well as to guide the training\nprocess.\nTEACHING MODULE.\nFEATS will be designed to perform its evaluation actions unobtrusively. To achieve\nthis we shall investigate an approach to gathering as much information for the user\nmodel as possible in a supervisory manner. That is, as the user interacts with the\nsystem, FEATS will gather information for the user model by carefully evaluating the\nuser actions, much as a human supervisor would. This supervisory function will\ncoexist with the test-and-grade (TAG) approach.\n\n,\nI\n\nThe supervisory function will extract (mainly negative) evaluation information from\ncommunication failures which attempt to violate the system model or the pragmatic\nbeliefs of the system. The TAG function will yield (positive and negative) ,\nevaluation information by observing the effect of actions performed by the user\nunder direction of FEATS.\nI\n1\n\nThus, two sources will supply data for the user model: the supervisory function, and\nthe training TAG function. Information gathered in this model will then be used to\nselect appropriate inteFaction level with the user.\nCONCLUSION\nThis paper describes early stages of the FEATS project. FEATS offers intelligent\nfeatures for control and interrogation of the underlying finite element system, as\nwell as facilities for effective training of personnel in the use of the system\nresources.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nA prototype of FEATS is being written in Prolog on a Texas Instruments Explorer LX.\nThe latter is a dual processor machine consisting of a lisp machine (EXPLORER) and\nan If68020 based computing engine (LX)\nrunning a Unix System V. This provides\ntherefore an ideal environment for cooperation between AI type of a system and an\nengineering type of a system. In our case, the AI system is FEATS, whereas the\nengineering system is NASTRAN.\nAPPENDIX 1: FINITE ELEMENT PRINCIPLES.\nThe Finite Element Method is a\n\ndominant numerical\n\n26\n\nmethod used\n\nin the solution of\n\n,\n\nPartial Differential Equations over regions with irregular geometries. This method\n, finds applications in many fields, eg: aeronautics, structural engineering, reactor\ndesign, shipbuilding, geology, mining, to mention but a few. A number of commercial\nfinite element packages exist, eg. NASTRAN, W I S A , ANSYS, etc. As a rule, these\npackages are large and complex. For example, the M W N A S T R A N has over 480,000 lines\nI of FORTRAN code, and over 15 volumes of documentation.\n\nI\n\nEssentially, the method consist of three main phases.\n\nIn the first phase\n\nthe region of integration is subdivided into a number of\n(simplicial) elements, and over each such element a trial function is proposed. A\ntrial function approximates the solution of the system over that element. The\n\'total\' solution is then expressed as a sum of solutions over the elements of the\nregion.\n\nIn the second phase, the total solution is formulated in terms of the trial\nfunctions (with prescribed continuity conditions). This phase, referred to as the\n\'assembly phase\' results in a system of equations whose unknowns represent the\nvalues of the required solution at the nodes of the elements. Typically, the\nresulting equations are very large and sparse. The distribution of nonzeros in ths\nequations is then condensed via node reordering, or element reordering.\nIn the third phase, the resulting equations are solved. In fact, the solution can be\nrealized without the assembly phase. Such methods have a number of advantages, as\nwell as disadvantages.\n\nt\n\nWhen the above three phase cycle is completed, the accuracy of the solution may\nrequire refinement of the subdivision (local or global), and the above solution\nprocess to be repeated over a new subdivision. To afford an automatic implementation\nof this refine-and-solve loop, the data structures representing the subdivision must\nbe appropriately designed.\nSome of\n\ni\n\nthe research\n\nby the author concerning the above stages of FEM is described\n\nin the following papers [Bykat, 1973; 1974; 1976; 1977; 19831.\n\nI\n\n27\n\nREFERENCES.\nAnderson J.R.

Bender and Malcolm P. Johnson\nPDA Engineering\n\nSUMMARY\nThe Mechanical Computer-Aided Engineering (MCAE) market is expanding rapidly through\nadvanced hardware and software systems. The communication channels in the MCAE market is\ncrucial in obtaining the information necessary for design decisions. A design model can be created\nin one software package, analyzed in several others, and the results processed in still other\npackages. Loss of data means loss of important design information. PATRANs neutral file format\nis designed for storing information in a clear, concise and complete format. This format allows\ncomplex design information to be passed between PATRAN and other software packages.\nPATRAN and COSMIC NASTRAN@ are used at many major manufacturing companies\nworldwide. These companies use the PAT/COSMIC-NASTRAN interface developed by PDA\nEngineering to transfer design data between these two powerful software programs. The data\ntransferred between PATRAN and NASTRAN includes finite element data, loads and boundary\nconditions, material and property definitions, and analysis results data. The coupling of these two\ncodes helps an analyst make intelligent decisions regarding his complex design. PATRAN and\nNASTRAN were used at Deutsch Metal Components for analysis of swage head tooling. Through\nthe use of these two software codes they were able to make important design modifications\ncontributing to increased functionality of the tool.\nINTRODUCTION\nMCAE is the process of defining a physical model of a design in a computer, then\nsubjecting that model to a simulated environment to determine its response (ref 1). By\nanalyzing the model\'s reaction to the applied loads, the design can be verified and\noptimized.\nThe great benefit of MCAE is that it allows the engineer to take his design from conception\nto reality with less need for prototypes. More "what if\' questions can be asked by the\nengineer, improving the design, shortening the development cycle and reducing the product\ncosts.\nUntil recently, MCAE has been composed of a range of valuable but incompatible software\ntools, each designed to perform some aspect of the CAE function-structural analysis,\nthermal analysis, composite materials analysis, kinematics, and others, plus pre- and postprocessing.\nThe PATRAN System, however, offers an extensive MCAE software interface system.\nPATRAN not only has the capability to perfonn many of the MCAE functions itself, it also\ngives the engineer access to many existing software tools, and makes all those tools easily\naccessible-and useful. This allows the engineer to model the design, model the\n\n31\n\nenvironment, analyze the model within the environment and interpret the results, and then\noptimize that design.\nThe PATRAN System is composed of PATRAN Plus, application modules and application\ninterfaces. The gateway utilities of PATRAN allow users the freedom to define their own\nsoftware environment, while application interfaces bring the "world" of MCAE into\nPATRAN. Virtually every major finite element code such as NASTRAN, as well as many\nimportant computer aided drafting and manufacturing software packages, can be tightly\nlinked into the PATRAN interface system.\n\nI\nI\n\n\'\n\nThe PATRAN System\n\nPATRAN is an open-ended, general purpose, 3-D mechanical computer aided engineering\n(MCAE) software package that uses interactive graphics to link engineering design analysis\nand results evaluation functions. The package includes an advanced solid modeler,\nextensive graphics imaging capabilities, the industry\'s acknowledged leading finite element\nmodeler, interactive representation of analysis results, and a unique, open-ended "gateway"\narchitecture that facilitates access to virtually every design, analysis and manufacturing\nsoftware program.\nPATRAN provides users with the ability to conceptualize, develop, and test a product on\nthe computer prior to committing manufacturing and material costs. Its powerful yet\nconcise command structure permits realistic, detailed model representations to be generated\non most major hardware configurations, from workstations to super computers. The\npackage consists of five tightly integrated modules, including P/SOLID, P/FEM,\nP/IMAGE, P/POST, and P/PLOT, plus G/GATEWAY.\nP/SOLID is a geometric modeling system that incorporates both analytic solid modeling\n(ASM) and trimmed surface modeling (TSM) techniques. ASM defines entities based on\nparametric cubic curves, surfaces, and solids. TSM represents bodies by their surfaces, a\ncollection of trimmed bicubic surface patches. For solid model generation using Boolean\noperations, TSM is optimal. ASM permits mass property calculations, including fixed or\nvariable properties such as density. ASM also provides the link to finite element mesh\ngeneration for two and three dimensional objects, and spatially dependent boundary\nconditions. The two modeling methods are interwoven, allowing the engineer to use both\nsimultaneously and interactively. P/SOLID\'s integration into PATRAN Plus makes it easy\nto accurately conceptualize, model, and modify potential designs.\nPFEM helps prepare models for analysis. The geometry created by P/SOLID is accessed\ndirectly to develop a finite element mesh, apply loading and boundary conditions, and\ndefine physical properties. Because of the strong tie between P/FEM and P/SOLID, a finite\nelement mesh is easily developed from the geometric model, permitting generation of\nmultiple code-specific meshes and constraints. Meshes can be uniform across a model or\nconcentrated around critical regions, supplying the needed refinement to examine design\nconcerns. P/FEM provides capabilities to help insure the integrity of the mesh, including\nplate element checking. Additionally, the module uses P/IMAGE to display and verify all\ndata prior to executing an analysis.\nP/IMAGE encompasses the complete graphics capability found within PATRAN Plus. The\nmodule includes graphic feedback for all commands, provides presentation shading, and\nserves as a visual verification prior to executing an analysis. P/IMAGE features a number\nof options that take advantage of the hardware\'s capabilities, including local view\n\n32\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n1\n\nmanipulation, local shading, multiple light sources, and transparency. Apart from these\nadded enhancements, the PATRAN display is similar across all machines. This makes it\neasy for the user to learn the program within a heterogeneous hardware environment.\nP/POST quickly and clearly displays analysis results onto a PATRAN model. Results can\nbe structural, thermal, fluid, magnetic, or any other application where the resultant values\nare associated with their respective nodes or elements. P/POST eliminates the need for\nstacks of printout, making it easy for the user to understand the analysis results and\ndetermine critical regions. Its tight integration into the PATRAN Plus package allows users\nto super-impose results directly onto a P/FEM model, and subsequently modify the design\naccording to optimization requirements. In-house codes should have no trouble interfacing\nto the post-processing file\'s simple format. P/POST employs a variety of means to depict\nresults, including animation, deformed geometry plots, contour plots, fringe plots, carpet\nplots, vector plots, and X-Y plots for beam elements.\nP/PLOT, the newest module to be nested within PATRAN Plus, generates engineering XY plots. The module permits the user to display and compare two generic data sets, results\nvs. location for example, and assists in evaluating a design. Its coupling to the other\nmodules of PATRAN Plus enables the user to easily generate multiple graphs from within\nthe PATRAN system environment.\nGateway Utilities\nG/GATEWAY constitutes a collection of utility programs and features that enable a user to\njoin PATRAN Plus with external software packages. Utilities supplied with G/GATEWAY\nallow easy data transfer with PATRAN Plus, providing the link needed to interface\nbetween different software packages. G/GATEWAY permits PATRAN Plus to run on a\nvariety of hardware configurations, giving users a wide choice of operating environments.\nOther features include a number of separate utility programs to assist in the documentation,\npresentation, and manipulation of the information output by PATRAN Plus, as well as\nother application software.\nPATRANs open architecture can be used in a variety of ways for the exchange of useful\ninformation. G/GATEWAY features have broad implimentations across software and\nhardware systems. There are literally hundreds of ways in which the user can interact with\nPATRAN files. Below are just some examples of the use of G/GATEWAY which are\nprovided in the standard PATRAN package. Later we will concentrate on the PATRAN\nneutral file, which is the file used to communicate wt NASTFWN.\nih\n\nI\n\nt\n\nGDB-Access (DBXS) is a collection of FORTRAN utilities that access the PATRAN Plus\ndatabase directiy. It permits other applications to directly read PATRAN data through the\nGATEWAY system.\nPATRANIFC pennits users to customize the interface menu. It includes calls to PATRAN\nSystem supported Application Interfaces but can include invocation of any external\nsoftware package.\nHARDCOPY is a program to reformat PATRAN Plus generated graphic files into\ncommands.for CALCOMP and compatible plotters, For TRILOG and PRINTRONIX dot\nmatrix printers on some computer systems, and has ancillary support for the TEKTRONIX\n45 10 rasterizer.\n\n33\n\nOPTIONSET automatically customizes the PATRAN session environment through a\nsimple command file.\nThe Neutral System is the most commonly used method of linking PATRAN to other\nsoftware packages. The neutral file is a text formatted or binary file, generated and/or read\nby PATRAN, which contains selected PATRAN information. The neutral file includes\ngeometric model data, finite element definitions and associated properties, loads and\nboundary conditions, and groupings of entities called Named Components. The neutral file\nis used to communicate with analysis codes such as NASTRAN.\nPAT/COSMIC\nPAT/COSMIC is the link between PATRANs pre- and post-processing and NASTRANs\nanalysis of a model (ref 2). It consists of two software programs: PATCOS, which takes\nPATRAN neutral file data and converts it to a NASTRAN bulk data deck for analysis; and\nCOSPAT, which converts a NASTRAN OUTPUT2 file into PATRAN-compatibleresults\nfiles. COSPAT can also be used to read a NASTRAN bulk data deck and convert it into a\nPATRAN neutral file. PAT/COSMIC is an interactive program. Inputs required from the\nuser are minimal and execution time is short.\nPATCOS can produce 59 different NASTRAN bulk data cards, including 29 different\nelement types. Prompts and other aids built into the program should enable a new user to\nobtain a successful PATCOS run on the very first try, without any external instructions.\nIf desired, three parameters may be set during PATCOS execution: MINSD, LGRID, and\nAPZERO. MINSD defines the minimum permissible number of significant digits for real\nvalues on the bulk data cards. LGRID determines which coordinate frame is specified on\nthe GRID card, whether the frame used during creation of a node or the global coordinate\nframe. A E R O is a value specified which causes all values less than that to be set to\nabsolute zero during translation @e. if APZERO is set to 1.OE-4 and a node is identified as\nhaving a coordinate value of 1.OE-5 in PATRAN, PATCOS will set that coordinate in the\nGRID card to 0.0).\n\nThe complete list of supported card types are contained in Table 1.\nCOSPAT creates PATRAN-readableresults files from a NASTRAN OUTPUT;! file. These\nresults files include nodal displacements, element centroidal stresses and strains, and nodal\nstresses. In order to generate an OUTPUT2 file from a NASTRAN analysis, DMAP Alter\nsequences must be included in the bulk data deck prior to analysis. DMAP Alter sequences\nare provided with COSPAT for the most commonly used solution sequences.\nCOSPAT results files can be read into PATRAN for post-processing. The results files are\nin a column format, with various columns of data associated with each node or element.\nFor example, fust principal stresses are contained in column 22 for CHEXAl elements.\nAs mentioned previously, COSPAT can also read a NASTRAN bulk data deck and create a\n\nPATRAN neutral file. This could be very useful for a new PATRAN user who already has\nNASTRAN models stored on his computer. Many companies have taken finite element\nmodels which were not built with a graphics pre-processor and brought these models into\nPATRAN. The users were surprised to find errors in their modeling technique, such as\n"bow-tied" elements (incorrect connectivity turns rectangular shaped elements into a bowtied shape), that are only apparent with graphics systems. By utilizing PATRAN these\n\n34\n\ncompanies were able to go back and correct modeling errors and design judgements based\non these incorrect analyses.\nAlso, many large companies provide sub-contractors with already-built finite element\nmodels for further analysis. These NASTRAN models can be easily read into PATRAN for\nmodification, such as changes in the design or material properties. After the changes are\nmade, the analyst can simply write out another neutral file, run PATCOS to create a\nNASTRAN bulk data deck, and take the new model into NASTRAN for further analysis.\nDeutsch Metal Components is a good example of how a company uses PATRAN and\nNASTRAN to design and analyze a specific part.\nPATRAN and NASTRAN at Deutsch Metal Components\nDeutsch Metal Components is a manufacturer of Permaswage@advanced tube connecting\nsystems and swage tooling for the Aerospace, Marine, and Oil industries. Deutsch has one\nof the largest manufacturing facilities in Southern California. Advanced equipment at\nDeutsch includes computerized order processing and inventory control, CNC\nmanufacturing, and the latest in CAD/CAM systems.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nDeutsch currently has three PATRAN users running on a PRIME 2655 computer.\nPATRAN has been in-house at Deutsch since February 1985. Initial designs are created\nusing PRIME MEDUSA and translated to PATRAN via an interface snpplied by PRIME.\nThe finite element models, including nodes and elements, material and property definitions\nand loading conditions are created in PATRAN. Hardcopies of the k i t e element model and\nanalysis results were obtained by PATRAN through a Tektronix 4115 terminal hooked to a\nTektronix 4692 ink-jet plotter. Finite element data is passed to NASTRAN for analysis via\nPAT/COSMIC.\nDeutsch initiated a redesign of their swage tooling, which radially compresses fittings onto\npipes, eliminating costly welding of these pipes. A hydraulic power unit is connected to the\nswage head tooling and provides the force needed to fit the pipes together. Prime\nconsideration in the redesign of the swage tooling was reduction ot the swage head radius.\nThis radius controls the distance between two piping systems. The smaller the swage head,\nthe closer together the pipes can be placed, creating a more efficient piping system\nenvironment. Other design considerations of the swage head were weight and cost of\nmanufacturing. PATRAN and NASTRAN were used to minimize the swage head radius\nwhile keeping the stress levels generated in the part under the maximum allowable stress\nlevels.\nThe swage tooling is comprised of three parts: the swage head, the die block, and the\ncylinder (see Figure 1). The finite element model was created with 2D axisymmetic\nelements. Vertical force loadings were applied to the model to simulate the hydraulic\npressure translated through the swage head. Single point constraints were applied along the\nvertical axis as well as axisymmetric boundary conditions. PATCOS created the\nNASTRAN bulk data deck from the PATRAN model. The analysis took 1-2 hours on the\nPrime computer. Results were translated back into PATFUN for post-processing.\n\n35\n\nSwage I Iead\nBearing area radius\n\nDie Block\nt\n\nI\n\nCylinder\nI\n\nr\n\nl\n\nr\n\nl\n\nFigure 1.

The classic text in vibrations by Timoshenko\'\nprovides closed form solutions to the frequency equations f o r\nsimply supported uniform bars. So the tests that are logical tc\nrun involve simply supported bars (hinged) under various combinstions of parameters. The results can be checked by substituting\nthe test parameters into the appropriate Timoshenko frequency\nequation and, then by comparing frequencies f o r corresponding\nmodes. The next question to ask is, "Can the mass cou3ling\nalgorithm be improved?" One is inclined to think s o , >-,ecause (1)\nthe algorithm in 1987 NASTRAN cdnsiders only how the x a s s is\ndistributed along the length and not how mass is distriauted o v e r\nthe cross-section; and ( 2 ) it couples this translational ; n a S S\ndistribution to the gird points at the end of an element chrough\nthe static displacement due to bending and ignores displacement\ncontributions from shear.\n\n44\n\n1\n\nLast year I presented a paper2 on this topic and di.i a Lot of\nright things, but I did one thing wrong which took all the stzam\nout of the paper. This year I will take one step backwards and\nrecoup my goof, then I will advance the topic by including defa3rmation due to shear. The goof that I made in 1987 was tc use t k e\nwrong theoretical basis for judging the merits of the r e s u l t s .\nNow when the proper criterion is used, the conclusions are 3 s\nrewarding as I had hoped that they would be.\nThe parameters to be controlled fall into 3 cateaori$:;:\nnamely geometric, elastic, and mode of mass coupling.\n\nI\n\nABSTRACT\n\ni\nI\n\ni\n\n1\nI\n\nt\n~\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\ni\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\nI\n1\n\nCoupled mass for bars in bending has been investigated. The\ninclusion of rotary inertia for the case in which shear is ianored (infinite) has a beneficial effect. Once shear effects are\nincluded, there is some question as to how well static defleztions approximate the dynamic shape.\n\nTest Basis\nTests will be run by analyses using NASTRAN. The qecmetric\nparameters will be invariant throughout all tests. The bar will\nbe prismatic, 20" long, of rectangular section 4" x 1". with\nfreedoms in bending and none in axial or torsion.

The higher moces are more\nsensitive to omission of refinements.\nWithout any refinements\nthe 10th mode can have 4 0 % error in the class of soft modes and\ncan have error of a factor of 4 for the class of stiff modes.\nJust including.rotary inertia without shear can cut the error S y\n60% in the class of soft modes and by a factor of 2 in the class\nof stiff modes. Just including shear without rotary inertia can\nkeep modes within 3% of accurate values. It remains to be seen\nhow the scheme of consistent mass with and without rotary icertia\nbased on the assumption that static deformation is representative\nof dynamic behavior for purpose of computing inertia coupling.\n\n,\n\ni\n1\n\ni\n\nI\n~\n\nI\n\nI\n\nRESULTS\nReturning to the unfinished business from last year\'s paper,\nthe wrong impression can be quickly dispelled by comparing logarithmic p l o t s of the ratios of computed to theoretical frequend e s . Errors range over 4 decades from .01% to 100% against 10\nmodes in each class.\n\n\'I\n\ni\n\nI\nFigure 1 represents a model for which the shear modulus can\nlegitimately be neglected and rotary inertia can be ignored. The\nsimplified frequency equation is included in the legend. This is\na popular practice of many NASTRAN users today.\nStandard\nCOUPMASS was used; xhich means that only translational n a s s was\ncoupled to the ends through the static delfections from bending\nwithout shear. Modes in both the soft and stiff classes fall an\ntop of one another. The first 3 modes contain < 0.1% error. The\n\n52\n\nfirst 5 modes contain ( 0.5% error. The first 6 modes contain\n1% error.\nThe first 9 modes contain < 4% error. Only when the\nmodal harmonic is ) 2 less than the total mass points does the\nerror make a sudden jump. This confirms last year\'s results and\nthe results that Archer3 published.\nNext, Figure 2 makes a proper comparison of models havinq\ninfinite shear, when one couples only translational inertia acd\nthe other couples both translational and rotational inertias\nthrough the static deflections from bending only. Note that the\nfrequency\nequation is like the one in figure 1 without rotary\n\nLJL~\n\nI\n\nI\n\n+ n2r2r2. This tends\ninertia except that L2 is replaced by\nto depress the frequency with mode number and with high ratios of\nI/A. The curves marked BBRl and BBR2 are plots of the NASTRAN\nmodels which used mass coupling of both translational and rotational inertias. Their accuracy picture relative to this set of\ntheoretical frequencies is almost a duplicate of the curves in\nFigure 1 for the translational coupling case versus its simplified theoretical frequencies. To demonstrate the improvement of\nadding rotary inertia, the ratios of modal frequencies of the\nfirst case, without rotary inertia, to the second frequency\nequation are drawn on this plot. n;at marked BBTl is for the\nstiff class of modes acting in plane 1 and BBT2 is for the sofc,\nclass of modes acting in plane 2 . Note that none of the modes of\nBBTl have errors less than 5% and accumulate 100% error as it\nreaches the 9th mode. The soft class, BBT2, produces 6 modes\nwith errors under 5%. In contrast, all 9 modes of both BBRl and\nBBR2 are < 5%. The work of the 1987 paper is vindicated!\n\nI\n\n53\n\nA\n\nlot of work was involved in computing the couplinq of\ntranslational inertias and then rotational inertias through the\nstatic deflections due to both bending and shear. Once calculated, there opens up many permutations of actions.\nTake the\ncase of the model that includes elastic actions from bendinq and\nshear, but no rotary inertia coupling. The translational nass\ncoupling can now take the options of: coupling from displacements acting through only; or coupling from displacements actinq\nthrough both bending and shear. Results from these two options\nare displayed in Figure 2 for the two class of stiff and soft\nmodes.\nThey are marked SSTl and SST2 for translational lnercia\ncoupled through static displacements from bending and shear; and\nSBTl and SBT2 for translational inertia coupled throuqh static\ndisplacements from bending only. Note that the frequency equation for this case including shear without rotary inertia is like\nthat for the rotary inertia case without shear except that the\nterm involving r2 is scaled by the ratio E/(kG). This implies\nthat the frequency is depressed as the shear factor for the cross\nsection "k" increases. But "k" is a non-dimensional shape factor\nindependent of size so \'*k"is the same for both the stiff and the\nsoft classes.\nBecause "E" is always ) "G" the effect of the\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nscaling is to shift importance away from the length and increase\nthe emphasis on mode number and section ration I / A . One would\ntend to develop a bias towards what results to expect based on\nthe trend of the first 2 cases; i.e. the case of coupling that\nembraces the more complete set of options in an instance would be\nexpected to perform best. It turns out that the most accurate\ncase is for SBT; i.e. mass which is coupled through displacements\ndue to bending only without shear. All 9 modes for the soft\n\n54\n\nI\n\nI\n\nclass SET2 have errors ( 5% and all 9 modes for the stiff class\nSET1 have errors < 7%. But the behavior of models with couplir,g\nthrough static displacements due to both bending and shear have\nmore error. The soft class SST2 has the first 4 modes with error\n( 1%; the first 6 modes with error < 5%; the first 8 modes\nwith\nFor the stiff class SSTl only the first 2 modes\nerror ( 10%.\nhave error ratios ( 1%; the first 4 modes have error ratios < 5 % ;\nthe first 5 modes have error ratios ( 10%; ar.d the 9th mode r i s e s\nto an error ratio of 20%. It would appear that for the c a s e zf\nbending with shear, NASTRAN is equipped to handle that well as i t\nnow stands by calling for COUPMASS and entering a shear coefficient on the PBAR card. Refining the coup1ir.g to embrace the\ndeformations from shear impair instead of benefit the modeling in\nthis case.\nIt is now instructive to see how much error results\nfrom using COUPMASS without shear for the case when shear is\nimportant.\nSoft case BET2 has only the first mode with an error\nratio < 1% and the 9th mode climbs to an error ratio of 3 5 % .\nStiff case BBTl has no modes with an error ratio ( 6% and the\nupper modes climb to an error ratio of 350%. BBRl and BBR2 with\nrotary inertia are only slightly better than BBTl and BBTZ.\nFinally we consider the fully refined case in Fiqure 4.\nElasticity includes both bending and shear. There are 4 permutations of mass coupling to consider:\n1.\nTTR=Translational inertia coupled through static Wrdinq displacement only; rotational inertia coupled through static Sending\ndisplacement only.\nTSR=Translational inertia coupled\n\n2.\n\nthrough\n\n55\n\nstatic\n\nbending\n\ndis-\n\nplacement\nplacement\n\nonly; rotational inertia coupled through static disfrom\nboth\nbending\nand\nshear.\n\n3 . SBR=Translational inertia coupled through static displace-\n\nment from both bending and shear; rotational inertia coupled\nthrough static bending displacement only.\n4.\nSSR=Translational inertia coupled through static displacement\nfrom both bending and shear; rotational inertia coupled through\nstatic displacement from both bending and shear.\nLooking at Table 1 and noting the theoretical ratios of shear\nwith and without rotary inertia, one is inclined to think that\nthe trend obtained for the third case would persist f o r this\nfourth case too; i.e. the fully coupled scheme might not be the\nmost accurate.\nBut the plotting of this fourth case will be\nsplit in two between responses in plane 1 and plane 2 , because\nthere is so much to put on one chart. The plot of plane 2 will\ncontinue as a semi-log plot, but plane 1 will be plotted\nCartesian.\nThe soft class will be considered first. The mass coupling\nthat produced the least error was that for which both translational and rotational inertias were coupled through the displacements from bending only, \'ITR2. All modes had frequency error\nratios < 2%. Only a fraction more and still within 2% were the\nmodels using translational inertias coupled through static displacements from bending only while rotational inertias were\ncoupled through static displacements from both bending and shear,\nTSR2.\n\n56\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\'\n~\n\nI\n\nI\n\nGdhen the translational mass is coupled through static d i s placement from both bending and shear and the rotary inertia is\ncoupled through alternates of with and without shear, SSR2 and\nSBR2, the error ratio is within 5% for the first 8 modes f o r both\nkinds of coupling. For the 9th mode there is only 1% spread\nSBR and SSR, s o \' other than this they are almost conbetween\ngruent. Even when no rotational inertia is included, the translational mass coupled through static displacements from bending\nonly, SBTZ, maintains the error < 10% for the first 3 modes.\nWhen translational mass is coupled through static displacements\nfrom both bending and shear, SSTZ, the error is < 10% for t h e\nfirst 7 modes.\nThe picture changes dramatically f o r the class of stiff\nmodes.\nOnly the fundamentals of all 4 types of coupling a r e\nwithin 1% accuracy. Only the 2nd mode for all 4 types is within\n3% accuracy.\nOnly the first 3 modes for 4 types have error\nratios within 10%. The error increases steeply to 40% in the 8th\nmode.\nThe one case that has error less than 10% f o r all nine\nmodes is SST1. This also was best f o r the case examir,ed in\nFigure 3 .\nThe generaletrend from all four of these figures is that\ncoupling of translational mass serves a majority of cases, Sut\nrotational inertia is needed for the beams without shear deformation and whose section has sizeable moments of inertia. Rotational inertia is also good for the soft case of the most refined\nbeam.\nThis leads to a\'possibility that not all bugs were found\nin doing this work for the rotational inertia stiff class of the\n\n57\n\nmost refined case.\nand anomaly.\n\nThe fact that the error is negative suggests\n\nThe rule has.been confirmed that the highest mode that can be\ntrusted is the one that is 2 l e s s than the number of mass points.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

To reduce problem size\nduring optimization, least-square orthogonal polynomials or\nbilinear shape functions may be employed to link design\nvariables. In an effort to automate optimum design of\ncomposites, this capability has been developed for ROCKWELL\nNASTRAN, by integrating RPK Corp,\'s CRAY version of NASA\'s\nCOSMIC-released NASTRAN, the ADS nonlinear programming code,\nand NASA/AMES NASOPT interface program, on Rockwell\'s CRAY\nX-MP computer, Numerical examples tested demonstrate that\nproper use of optimization can be effective in a real-life\nenvironment, by promoting design economy within a timely\nschedule.\nINTRODUCTION\nWith the primary objective of minimizing structural weight,\ncost (including producibility), or (1.0 - reliability), as a\nsingle-valued function, the design optimization module has\nbeen designed, developed, and implemented in ROCKWELL NASTRAN\nto generate a series of designs until convergence to the best\ndesign, in a minimum number of design iterations. The number\nof trial designs determined should be governed by whether or\nnot the cost of new calculation would exceed savings resulting\nfrom the improved design, To do this manually would be\ndifficult, time-consuming, and expensive, With computers\nbecoming larger in storage, faster in turnaround, and cheaper\n\n64\n\nin price, it has become cost-effective to determine optimum\nsolution quicker with better limits on design variables,\ngeometric shapes can be refined, feasible mass and\ntemperature-dependent modulus can be derived from experimental\ntest data through close correlation with analytical FEM\npredictions. However, the ability to formulate problems is\nlimited based on design experience, especially with composites.\nIn a future implementation, the discrete optimization problem\nwill have discrete data for design variables from spare\npart-size inventory, e g , w r t,\n..\n..\nprescribed orientations for\nlayered composite fibres, and the number of layers; parametric\nstudies often yield the immediate answer at the present,\nRockwell NASTRAN finite-element structural analysis program,\nbased on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s COSMIC-released NASTRAN code (l), has been\naugmented with ADS Constrained Optimization Code (2,3) to\nautomate optimum structural design in a cost-effective manner.\nThe program minimizes structural weight by reducing thickness,\netc. for predefined shape/design configuration. The program is\nalso useful to adjust the finite element model stiffness and\nmass for validation against test data, e-g. on frequencies and\nmode shapes of vibration, or i f already validated, to reduce\nvibration by detuning based on selective structural\nmodification (4-8). Other comparable codes are - ASTROS ( 9 ) ,\nSTARSTRUC (lo), NISA (ll), ANSYS (12,131, MSC/NASTRAN ( 6 ) ,\nCSAR/OPTIM (141, and STARS (15). A typical problem in\nstructural optimization consists of 200 design parameters, 2000\nconstraints, and bounds on design variables to yield a\nproducible design among the multiple local optima discoverable\nby solving the mathematical programming problem using\nreasonable starting designs, which must be obtained first\nthrough either fully stressed design (1,13,14), stress ratio\nmethod (151, or optimality criteria formulation (10,16-22),\nPROBLEM FORMULATION\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAs summarized in Table 1, the problem of structural optimization\nis formulated as a mathematical programming problem. The\nobjective is to minimize weight, to validate FEM against test\ndata with least structural change, or to reduce vibration under\ntransient or harmonic excitation. For the test/analysis\ncorrelation problem, the objective represents a weighted sum of\nthe squares (Euclidean norm) of the errors between test and\nanalytical frequencies and/or eigenvectors. I f the test data is\nincomplete or uncertain, other approaches (4-8,23) seem more\npractical. I f the optimum structure is a minimum weight\nstructure of specified natural frequencies, a strain energy\ndensity approach is often adopted. Elements possessing maximum\n\n65\n\nstrain energy density are stiffened to seek the desired\nfrequency separation between excitation frequency and the\nnatural frequencies, To design composite structures (21,24,25)\nfor minimum weight, detailed models involving substructures ( 2 6 )\nmay be optimally re-sized (laminae thickness, assuming discrete\nnumber of layers and fibre orientation angles), subject to\ndeflection, stress, buckling, and frequency constraints, in\naddition to constraints on lamina failure indices and stresses.\nThe design can involve thickness, area, moment of inertia, mass\ndensity, but excludes grid coordinates or shape variables, and\nflutter derivatives in the present code; nor does it optimize\nthe dynamic response which may involve time-dependent\nconstraints over certain period, or mean stress (integral-type):\nthe equations of motion constitute an initial-value problem, We\ndo not address the shape optimization problem (27-30) with a\ndomain defined by a polynomial with unknown coefficients as\ndesign parameters, which NISA and ANSYS can probably do.\nProblem Statement\nLet (g(i), i=l,..,m)\nand (h(i), i=1, , . , p ) be sets of\nfunctions defined on the n-dimensional Euclidean vector space\nRn with values in the real space R. Let D = (Z: Z E Rn,\nand h(i,Z)= 0 for every\ng(i,Z) GE 0 for every i=l,..,m\ni=l,..,p).\nThe mathematical programming problem is to\ndetermine Z* E D such that f(Z*) = glb(f(Z): Z \xe2\x82\xac D), where\nf(Z*) is the value of the objective function f at the global\npoint Z*,\nPenalty Function Approach\nTransformation methods transform the constraints and objective\nfunction to an unconstrained problem by means of an exterior\nor interior penalty function. We have modified our copy of\nthe ADS fortran source code to enable optional use of the\ninterior logarithmic penalty function, shown by Gupta (31) to\nbe effective in solving the problem of constrained\noptimization problem as an unconstrained one:\nP(z,r) = f(Z)\n\n-\n\nrxlog(g(i))\n\n+\n\n(l/r)\n\nh(j)*h(j)\n\nwhere r is a non-negative scalar initialized such that the\ninequality penalty term is an order of magnitude smaller than\nthe objective function, The problem is most frequently\nnon-convex in that the hessian of P(2,r) wrt\n..\nZ is\nsemi-indefinite, yielding several local minima depending on the\n\n66\n\nstarting design 2. A large condition number for the hessian\nmatrix, i r e r ,the ratio of its largest to smallest eigenvalue\ncan cause poor rate of convergence, particularly with the\nsteepest descent method. The Davidon-Fletcher-Powell or BFGS\nvariable-metric method in ADS code, on the other hand, is\nuseful to generate an approximate hessian which is positive\ndefinite and preferrably well-conditioned for sake of\nconvergence,\nThe interior-point penalty function formulation option in the\nADS code is premised on maintaining feasibility of the design\nthroughout the design iterations, Design parameters, e g ,\n..\nthickness, area, moment of inertia, can be constrained to\nremain within user-specified limits, To estimate limits on\nstate variables - maximum displacement, stress allowables,\nupper and lower bounds on frequency - is more difficult,\nSENSITIVITY GRADIENTS\nThe analysis module solves equilibrium equations to predict\nresponse in terms of analysis variables - displacements and\nfrequencies - which are implicit and nonlinear functions of\ndesign parameters, It provides values of the objective function\nand constraints and their gradients, separately; e g , gradients\n.,\n..,\nparameters. Analytical\ndisclose how sensitive stress is w r t\ndifferentiation is laborious, error-prone, and difficult to\nimplement. Though costly and dependent upon problem size and\nnumber of design variables, implicit differentiation (24,321 by\nperturbation of the equilibrium equations has been made possible\nin Rockwell\'s COSMIC-released NASTRAN; it reproduces the results\nof MSC/NASTRAN, following the same mathematical procedure\n(24,321, The design space method is not as efficient as the\nstate space method, but chosen as in MSC/NASTRAN for ease of\nimplementation. It provides the optimization code with first\nderivative or the Jacobian of the constraints and objective\nw,r.t, set of selected design variables, The scalar objective\nfunction represents the weight along the in-plane or normal\n(bending) direction, when seeking minimum-weight design.\nSpecifically, in implicit differentiation, assuming first-order\nperturbation, change in element stiffness matrix is computed,\nand then multiplied by the original static displacement solution\nto obtain pseudo loads. The displacement increment due to\npseudo nodal loads is solved for using the original stiffness\nmatrix, and is added to the original displacement solution to\nobtain the perturbated displacement solution for recovery of\nconstraint and stress values,\n\n67\n\nOPT1 MI ZATION STRATEGY\nSeveral Fortran codes - IDESIGN (33,34), CONLIN ( 2 4 ) , NEWSUMT\n(301, and ADS ( 2 ) - are commercially available, for interface\nwith your FEM code, or to solve mathematical programming\nproblems with constraints, For unconstrained optimization, IMSL\nand NAG libraries provide several different gradient routines,\nThe ADS code was selected for incorporation into ROCKWELL\nNASTRAN, in continuation of work with its predecessor CONMIN and\nits proclaimed success in ASTROS ( 9 ) with the modified method of\nfeasible direct ions.\nOptimization steps involved with the use of ROCKWELL NASTRAN and\nNASOPT/ADS codes that may be repeated to achieve an acceptable\noptimum design are as follows:\nStep 1: Fully Stressed Design (FSD)\nFSD module in NASTRAN was improvised to generate for ADS a good\nstarting design to assure convergence to an acceptable\nminimum-weight design, Each element is re-sized in ratio of its\nstrain-energy density, sqrt(E/M), where E is % of total strain\nenergy, and M the % of total structure mass, to reach the\nprescribed displacement or stress limit, as if, decoupled from\nother element s ,\nThe stress ratio method in FSD was greatly improved by making\neach element independent; its cross-sectional area and inertia\nwere adjusted to remain mutually compatible and within\nprescribed lower and upper limits, based on linear stress\nratio of its material stress allowable to that calculated f o r\nits current section modulus and area,\nStep 2 FEM Analysis (Outer Loop)\n:\nStatic analysis for minimum-weight design or an eigenvalue\nanalysis for FEM validation is a pre-requisite for providing ADS\noptimization code with values of objective, constraints,\ngradients, and selected design parameters,\n:\nStep 3 Design Variable Linking\n\nIt is cost-effective to optimally re-size upto 100 independent\ndesign parameters using ADS code to achieve minimum-weight\ndesign or to validate FEM Model to closely approximate dominant\n\n68\n\n\'\n\n1\n1\n\nI\ni\n\ntest frequencies and mode shapes. The extra variables can be\nmade dependent through design variable linking, based on our new\ncapability to automatically generate bilinear shape functions\n( 3 5 ) - The use of least-square orthogonal polynomials looks\npromising for the future (36)Step 4 ADS Optimization (Inner LOOP)\n:\nThe independent design parameters are iteratively re-sized using\ninitially-supplied gradients by the modified ADS code until\nconvergence to a local minimum. The NASTRAN cards with the new\ndesign variable values are prepared to repeat as needed the\nexpensive analysis of step 2, which the user can monitor and\ncontrol, interactively.\nEXAMPLE PROBLEMS\n\n,I\nI\ni\n\n1\n\nTable 2 lists some demonstration problems that have been\nsuccessfully solved using Rockwell NASTRAN\'s newly implemented\noptimization capability based on the ADS code, Rockwell NASTRAN\nGroup assists users with specific problem formulation and\nsolution strategy selection.\nNUMERICAL CONS1 DERATI ONS\nlinear elastic structure is assumed here, I f structure\nrequires nonlinear analysis, the incremental design (37)\nsensitivity approach in ANSYS enables optimum design. More than\none minimum solution may be found, because most structural\nproblems are inherently not convex in nature in that they do not\nlend themselves to the globally convergent unique optimum\nsolution from an arbitrary or random starting design, but\ninstead rely on the proximity of the starting design. Numerical\nConsiderations for the optimization technique require attention\nto generality, reliability of global convergence, efficient rate\nof convergence, variable step size to minimize the number of\ntrials, selection procedure for potentially active constraints,\nease of use, and designer-friendliness.\nA\n\nConvergence to Optima\n\ni\n\nConvergence to an optimum solution within ADS is indicated\nwhen relative change in design parameters is less than the\nuser-specified tolerance (2%,say) in order to reduce the\n\n69\n\nobjective further. Linear rate of convergence occurs with\nmethods of Feasible direction, gradient projection,\ngeneralized reduced gradient and cost function bounding\ntechniques. Potentially active constraints at current design\niteration are included, the rest deleted from the next\niteration to save cost, Feasible direction method zigzags\nwith equality constraints, The variable-metric method with\nour implementation of the logarithmic penalty function tends\nto be more effective, However, for large structural problems,\nVanderplaats ( 2 ) recommends Sequential linear, quadratic, or\nconvex programming option for ISTRAT in Table 1 along with\npolynomial interpolation for 1-D search instead of using\nPenalty function and Golden section search, in an effort to\nreduce the number of NASTRAN FEM analyses. Generally, the\nimplementation requires defining zero, heuristic rules to\nhandle adverse situations based on user experience and safety\nmeasures, so as to seek convergence for ill-conditioned cases,\nsince theory is valid in exact arithmetic not with limited\nar i thmet ic prec i sion ,\nThe quadratic programming problem with a quadratic cost\nfunction and linear constraints (especially with reciprocal\nvariables: y = PL**3/3EI - nonlinear constraint becomes\nsomewhat linear w/o need for a push-off factor in ADS) offers\nsuperlinear convergence with variable-metric methods for the\nconstrained optimization problem, in which linear constraints\nrepresent Taylor series expansion of the given nonlinear\nconstraints around current design state. Pshenichny\'s\nlinearization (33) of constraints has been recommended, The\nsuperlinear rate occurs with the quadratic programming method,\nInteractive Design Iterations\nInteractive finite-element modelling facilitates verification\nwith automated easy-to-use mesh-generation and refinement,\nLikewise, interactive design optimization allows design decision\nmaking and monitoring of algorithm interactively, but intuition\nor some experience is necessary. It can be slow for large\nproblems, need supercomputers at back end, and can save valuable\nresources by proper monitoring of algorithms. One may introduce\nnew design variables, objective and constraint functions,\nutilizing constraint violation histories and interactive\ngraphics. Ability to choose algorithm, to restart from any\ndesign, to manually change design, or to fix design parameters\nfor later release, are desirable features,\nThe new software trend will be dictated by problem size, lessons\nlearnt or knowledge-base (38,39) in design optimization, data\n\n70\n\n1\n\nI\n\ni\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI,\n~\n\n1\n\niI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\n1\nI\n\n,\n\nI\n\nbase management (40) concepts, modular programming, efficiency\nand robustness, and parallel processing (41-43).

Several structural performance and resizing (SPAR)\nthermal models and NASA structural analysis (NASTRAN) structural models were set up for the orbiter\nwing midspan bay 3. The thermal model was found t o be the one that determines the limit of finiteelement fineness because of the limitation of computational core space required for the radiation view\nfactor calculations.

For simple structures, the\nelement sizes may be reduced sufficiently t o obtain highly accurate solutions. However, for large complex\nstructures, such as the space shuttle orbiter, the use of excessively fine elements in the finite-element\nmodels may result in unmanageable computations that exceed the memory capability of existing computers.\nThis computational limitation is frequently encountered during radiation view factor computations in the\nthree-dimensional finite-element heat transfer analysis of complex structures. Because of computational\nlimitations in the past heat transfer analysis of the space shuttle orbiter, only small local regions of the\norbiter structure were modeled. Several regions of the space shuttle were modeled by KO, Quinn, and\nGong. For the past several years, these finite-element models were used to calculate orbiter structural\ntemperatures, which were correlated with the actual flight d a t a during the initial orbit tests of the space\nshuttle Columbia (refs. 1 t o 7). Recently, Gong, KO, and Quinn (ref. 4) conducted a finite-element heat\ntransfer analysis of the orbiter whole wing (fig. 1) using a thermal model with relatively coarse elements\n(fig. 2). A similar whole wing finite-element structural model was used by KO and Fields (ref. 8) in the\nthermal stress analysis of the orbiter whole wing. Both the thermal model (fig. 2) and the corresponding\nstructural model (fig. 3) set up for the orbiter whole wing were too coarse t o give sufficiently accurate\nstructural temperature and thermal stress distributions. Before modifying the existing wing models by\nincreasing the number of joint locations t o improve the solutions, it is necessary to determine the minimum\nnumber of joint locations required for the modified wing thermal model (the corresponding wing structural\nmodel requires far fewer joint locations) t o give reasonably accurate structural temperature distributions\nwithout causing the radiation view factor computations t o become unmanageable. This report describes\n(1) heat transfer and thermal stress analyses of a single bay a t the orbiter wing midspan using several\ndifferent thermal and structural models having different numbers of joint locations (or different element\nsizes), (2) the effect of element sizes on the accuracies of solutions, and (3) the minimum number of joint\nlocations required for the single-bay model t o give reasonably accurate solutions. The results of this report\nwill form the basic criteria in remodeling the whole orbiter wing or modeling other types of hypersonic\naircraft wings (hot structures).\n\nWHOLE WING THERMAL AND\nSTRUCTURAL MODELS\nIn finite-element thermal stress analysis of the space shuttle orbiter, the temperature input to the structural\nmodel for the calculation of thermal stresses is usually obtained from the results of finite-element (or finitcdifference) heat transfer analysis using the corresponding thermal model. Since the thermal protection\nsystem (TPS) is not a major load-carrying structure, it is neglected in the structural model. Thus, the\nstructural model has far fewer joint locations (JLOCs) than the corresponding thermal model. For tlie\nwing models, the thermal model contains 2289 JLOCs, while the structural model has only 232 JLOCs\n(see table 1). Even though the thermai model has oiiiy one degree of freedom (temperature), heczuse of\n\n81\n\nthe radiation view factor computations and the transient nature of heat transfer, the computer core space\nrequired by the thermal model is always many times more than that required for the structural model,\nwhich has six degrees of freedom. Thus, the thermal model is the one that limits how fine the element size\ncan be reduced for improving the solutions.\n\n,\n\n,\n\nONE-CELL THERMAL MODELS\n\nI\n\nI\n\nTo study the improvement of structural temperature distributions by reducing the element sizes, ant1\nalso t o study the associated effort involved in the computations of radiation view factors, five structural\nperformance and resizing (SPAR, ref. 9) finite-element thermal models (with different degrees of element\nfineness) were set up for the orbiter wing midspan bay 3 bounded by Yo-226 and Y0-254 (see fig. 1). The\nfive SPAR thermal models A, B, C, D, and E are shown in figure 4. The thermal model A is set up to\nmatch the coarseness of the existing whole wing thermal model. The four-node area conduction (K41)\nelements were used t o model the wing skins, spar webs, rib cap shear webs, room temperature vulcanized\n(RTV) rubber layers lying on both sides of the strain isolation pad (SIP), and TPS surface coatings. The\naerodynamic surfaces for providing source heat generation were modeled with one layer of K41 elements\nof unit thickness. The spar caps, rib caps, and rib trusses were modeled with two-node line conduction\n(K21) elements. The TPS was modeled in 10 layers on the lower surface and 3 layers on the upper surface\nusing eight-node volume conduction (K81) elements. The SIP layer was modeled with only one layer of\nK81 elements. The external and internal radiations were modeled by attaching a layer of four-node area\nradiation (R41) elements t o the active radiation surfaces. The radiation into space was modeled with one\nR41 element of unit area. No radiation elements were attached t o the surfaces of spar caps, rib caps, rib cap\nshear webs, and rib trusses because of small exposed areas. A layer of four-node forced convection (C41)\nelements were attached to the internal surfaces of the bay t o model the internal convection of air resulting\nfrom the entrance of external cool air into the interior of the orbiter wing a t 1400 sec after reentry (or at\n100,000 ft altitude). The front and rear ends of the thermal models were insulated. Table 2 summarizes\nthe sizes (joint location number, number of different types of elements) of the five SPAR thermal models\nA, B, C, D, and E.\n\nHeat Input\nThe external heat inputs t o the SPAR thermal models are shown in figure 5. These aerodynamic heating\ncurves are associated with STS-5 flight trajectories and are taken from reference 4, which describes in\ndetail the method of calculations of aerodynamic heating.\n\nView Factors\nThe view factors used in the radiation to space were calculated by hand. However, for the internal radiation\nexchanges, the view factors were calculated by using a VIEW computer program, which is incorporated\ninto the SPAR thermal analysis computer program (ref. 9).\nFor both the external and the internal thermal radiation exchanges, all the view factors were calculated\nfrom the equation (ref. 9)\nA t K , = AJJt\n(1)\nwhere A, is the surface area of radiation exchange element i and FtJ is the view factor, defined as the\nfraction of radiant heat leaving element i incident on element j. In the calculation of view factors foi\nthe external radiation exchanges (considering that element i represents the space element and elemerit 3\nany radiation exchange element on the wing surface), FJ2was taken t o be unity; therefore, Ft3 = A,/-%\naccording to equation (1).\n\n82\n\n1\n\n\'\n\nValues of emissivity and reflectivity used to compute radiant heat fluxes are given in table 3. The\ninitial temperature distribution used in the analysis was obtained from the actual flight data. In thermal\nmodeling, the majority of the time was consumed in t h e computations of view factors.\n\ni\n\nInternal Forced Convection\nand induces convective heat transfer. The heat transfer coefficients used for C41 elements were calculated\nusing the effective air flow velocities inside the wing, listed in table 4 (ref. 6).\n\nTi+\' = Ti\n\n+ Ti At\n\n1\n\n1 .*\n\n+,\n\n-T; At2 +- -Ti At3 + . . .\n2!\n3!\n\n(3)\n\n, where Tj is the temperature vector a t time step ti and At is the time increment. The vector Tzis determined\n\n1\n\ndirectly from equation (2) as\n\nTi= -C-\'(17Ik\n\nKr\n\n+ Iih)Ti f C-\'(Q + R + H )\n\n(4)\nHigher order derivatives are obtained by differentiating equation (2) according to the assumptions that (1)\nmaterial properties are constant over At, (2) Q and H vary linearly with time, and ( 3 ) R is constant over\n\nAt:\n\n11\n\n\'\n\n1\n\n1\n\nIn the present computations, the Taylor series expansion (eq. (3)) was cut off after the third term. The\npressure dependency of the T P S and SIP thermal properties was converted into time dependency based\non the trajectory of the STS-5 flight.\nTime-dependent properties were averaged over time intervals (RESET TIME), which were taken to be\n25 sec. Temperature-dependent properties were evaluated at the temperatures computed a t the beginning\nof each time interval. The values Q, Q , and R were computed every 2 sec.\n\n83\n\nONE-CELL STRUCTURAL MODELS\nFor the thermal stress analysis, the NASA structural analysis (NASTRAN, ref. 10) computer program was\nused because it can handle temperature-dependent material properties. The SPAR structural computer\nprogram lacks this capability. The five NASTRAN structural models (not shown) corresponding to the\nfive SPAR thermal models A, B, C, D, and E (fig. 4) are essentially the same except that the T P S layers\nare removed in the NASTRAN structural models. Thus, each set of thermal and corresponding structural\nmodels have identical joint locations so that the temperature distribution obtained from the thermal model\ncan be input directly t o the corresponding structural model for the calculations of thermal stresses. The\nwing skins, spar webs, and rib cap shear webs were modeled with quadrilateral membrane and bending\n(CQUAD2) elements. The spar caps, rib caps, and rib trusses were represented with two-node tensioncompression-torsion (CROD) elements. To approximate the deformation field of the midspan bay 3 when\nit is not detached from the whole wing, the following boundary conditions were imposed on the NASTRAN\nstructural models.\n\n1. Yo-226 plane fixed-The grid points lying in the YO-226 plane have no displacements in the y\ndirection but are free to move in the 2 and z directions. The rotations with respect t o the 2 , y, and z axes\nare constrained.\n2. YO-254plane free-The grid points lying in the YO-254plane are free t o move in the\ndirections. The rotations with respect t o the 2, y, and z axes are constrained.\n\n2,\n\ny , and\n\n~\n\n1\n\n1\n\ni\n\'I\n\nI\n\n2 I\n\nT h e thermal loadings t o the NASTRAN structural models were generated by using the structural\ntemperature distributions calculated from the corresponding SPAR thermal models. Table 5 summarizes\nthe sizes of the five NASTRAN structural models. Because the T P S is removed, the structural models\nhave far fewer joint locations as compared with corresponding SPAR thermal models (see table 2).\n\nRESULTS\n\nI\n\n,\nI\n\n1\n\nStructural Temperatures\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nFigure 6 shows the time histories of the midbay TPS surface temperatures calculated by using different I\nSPAR thermal models. The five temperature curves respectively associated with the thermal models I\nA, B, C, D, and E are so close as t o be pictorially undiscernable. This implies that the element sizes\nin the substructure have negligible effect on the T P S surface temperatures. The STS-5 flight data are\nalso shown in figure 6 (solid circles) for comparison. Figure 7 shows the time histories of the structural I\ntemperatures in the midbay regions of the lower and upper wing skins calculated from different thermal\nmodels. The thermal models B, C, D, and E yielded almost identical skin temperatures in the midbay 1\nregions. However, the thermal model A gave slightly lower wing skin temperatures because of coarseness of\n\'\nthe model. The STS-5 flight d a t a are also shown in figure 7 (solid circles) for comparison. Figure 8 shows\nthe three-dimensional distributions of the wing skin temperatures, a t t = 1700 sec from reentry, over whole\nsurfaces of the lower and upper wing skins, calculated from different thermal models. The roof-shaped\nwing skin temperature distributions given by thermal model A (fig. 8(a)) is inadequate t o represent actual\ndistributions of the wing skin temperatures. The dome-shaped wing skin temperature profiles calculated\nfrom the thermal models B, C, D, and E (fig. 8(b) t o (e)) are caused by the existence of the spars and\nribs, which function as heat sinks. The dome-shaped wing skin temperature profiles imply the degree of\nthermal stress buildup in the wing skins, as will be discussed in the following section.\nFigure 9 shows the calculated structural temperature distributions in the plane YO-240of bay 3 at\n\nt = 1700 sec from reentry. The thermal model A definitely yielded inaccurate solutions. The structural\ntemperature distributions given by thermal models B, C , D, and E are quite close. Especially, the thermal\n\n84\n\ntions because they have the same number of elements in the spanwise direction. The shapes of the skin\ntemperature distributions given by model E approach circular arcs. The solutions given by the thermal\n\n\xe2\x80\x99 Figures 13 t o 15 respectively show the distributions of the chordwise stresses ux,spanwise stresses cry, and\n\nI shear stresses T~~ calculated using different NASTRAN structural models.

For the wing lower skin, the models C and D give uy distribution with\nstress-release zone at the mid bay region (fig. 14(c) and (d)). The uy distribution given by model E\n(fig. 14(e)) exhibits two zones: (1) stress-release zone between y = -240 and y = -254 and (2) stressincrease zone between y = -226 and y = -240. Figure 16 shows distributions of the spanwise stress\ncry calculated by using different NASTRAN structural models. Notice that the thermal stresses are very\nsensitive t o the finite-element sizes (or structural temperature distributions). The coarser models A and B\nyielded peak compression in the midbay regions of both lower and upper skins. However, as the number of\nelements increased (models C, D, and E), the shallow U-shaped distributions of oy in the lower skin shifted\nto shallow W-shaped distributions, and the peak compression regions moved near the spar webs. The slight\nstress release in the midbay region of the lower skin, based on the structural models C, D, and E, is due to\nthe bulging of the wing skin (described later in this section). For the upper skin, the zone of slight stress\nrelease showed up only for the stress distributions calculated from models D and E. These stress releases\nin the midbay regions of the wing skins were never observed in the earlier thermal stress analysis, which\nignored the three-dimensional deformations of the orbiter skins (that is, skin-bulging effect). Figure 17\nshows the distributions of chordwise stresses ux calculated from the five structural models. Again, the\nsolution given by the model A is quite poor. The distributions of uz given by the structural models B, C,\nand D (all of which have four elements in the spanwise direction) are quite close. The structural model E,\nwhich has eight elements in the spanwise direction, gave a magnitude of peak compressional stress about\n1.2 ksi above those predicted from the structural models B, C, and D. The marked difference in the ux\ndistribution given by model E and those given by models B, C, and D is due t o the existence of a stressincrease zone, which appeared only in model E. Unlike the distribution of uy (fig. 16)) the distributions of\ncrx calculated from all structural models did not exhibit stress release effects in the midbay regions of the\nwing skins. The magnitude of thermal stress ux (either in tension or compression) is higher than that of\nthermal stress oy shown in figure 16. Thus, ox is more critical than uy because the buckling strength of\nthe wing skin in the z direction (normal t o the hat stringers) is lower than that in the y direction (parallel\nto the hat stringers). The orbiter wing skin buckling stresses are in the neighborhood of ux = -12 ksi\n(normal t o hat stringers) and uy = -25 ksi (parallel to hat stringers).\nFigure 18 shows the distributions of shear stresses rxy and ryz in the cross section YO-252 (plane of\nhighest shear) predicted from different NASTRAN structural models. The high shear-stress regions are\nnear the lower spar caps.\n\n85\n\nWhen the number of finite elements is increased sufficiently, the ultimate distributions of the thermal\nstresses in the midspan bay 3 will look like the curves shown in figures 19 t o 21. Those curves in the figures,\nwere constructed by fitting the data points obtained from NASTRAN structural models E with s m o o t h\ncontinuous curves. Figure 22 shows the deformed shape of the orbiter wing midspan bay 3 due to STS-5\nthermal loading. The front half of the wing lower skin bulged inwardly, but the rear half bulged outwardly;\nalmost the entire wing upper skin bulged outwardly with more severe deformations in the front half region.\n~\n\nComputation Time\nTable 6 summarizes the number of internal radiation view factors Ft3 needed for different SPAR thermal I\nmodels, the total computation time used in the transient heat transfer analyses associated with each 1\nthermal model, and the radiation view factor computation time. The d a t a shown in table 6 are plotted 1\nin figure 23. Both the SPAR computation time and the number of internal radiation view factors appear\nt o increase almost exponentially with the increase in the number of JLOCs. However, the time required \xe2\x80\x98\nfor the radiation view factor computations turned out t o be insignificant compared with the total SPAR\ncomputation time. The curves in figure 23 show how fast the computational \xe2\x80\x9cbarrier\xe2\x80\x9d will be reached by\naccelerating the increase in the number of JLOCs.\n\nI\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nI\n\nFinite-element heat transfer and thermal stress analyses were performed on the space shuttle wing midspan\nbay 3 using several finite-element models of different degrees of element fineness. The effect of element\nsizes on the solution accuracy was investigated in great detail. The results of the analyses are summarized\nas follows:\n\n~\n\ni\nI\n\n1. The finite-element model A (thermal or structural), which has the same coarseness as the earlier\nwhole wing model, is too coarse t o yield satisfactory solutions.\nI\nI\n\n2. T h e structural temperature distribution over the wing skin (lower or upper) surface of one bay was\n\xe2\x80\x9cdome\xe2\x80\x9d shaped and induced more severe thermal stresses in the chordwise direction than in the spanwise\ndirection. The induced thermal stresses were very sensitive t o slight variation of structural temperature\ndistributions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nI\n\n,\nI\n\n3. T h e structural models with finer elements yielded spanwise stress distributions exhibiting a stress\nrelease zone (due to skin bulging) at the midbay region of the wing skin (lower or upper), and the peak wing\nskin compression occurred near the spar caps. However, the coarser models gave the peak skin compression\nin the midbay region.\n\n4. T h e front half of the wing lower skin bulged inwardly, but the rear half bulged outwardly. Almost\nthe entire wing upper skin bulged outwardly with more severe deformations in the front half region.\n5. For obtaining satisfactory thermal stress distributions, each wing skin (lower or upper) of one bay\nmust be modeled with a t least 8 elements in the spanwise direction (model E) and 10 elements in the\nchordwise direction (model D); each spar web must be modeled with at least 5 elements in the vertical\ndirections (model D).\n6. Both the computation time required for the SPAR transient heat transfer analysis and the number\nof view factors needed for internal radiation computations appeared t o increase almost exponentially with\nthe increase of the number of joint locations.\n\n86\n\n~\n\n7. Even with t h e huge number of radiation view factor computations, the radiation view factor comhtation time was found to be insignificant compared with the total computer time required for the SPAR\n.ansient heat transfer analysis.\n\nLEFERENCES\n1.

SHEERER\n.\nTEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED\nPERIPHERAL PRODUCTS DIVISION\nDATA SYSl\'EMS GROUP\n=LE,\n1 ABsTRAm.\nUsing the COSMIC NASTRAN computer program with modifications to allow\nmodelling of nonlinear magnetic materials, a model was made of a rotating\narmature printhead such as is used in the majority of dot matrix computer\nprinters. The results from the model were compared with experimental data\nand with the results of an approximate calculation and found to be in good\nagreement. Using a modification to NASTRAN which output element magnetic\nquantities directly to the PATRAN pre- and postprocessor,\nplots of magnetic\nflux, permeability and field energy were produced which provided a useful\nillustration of the parameters controlling the device\'s performance.\n2 DESCRIPTION OF A ROTATING ARMATURE PRINTHEAD:\nA rotating armature printhead consists of several actuator assemblies such\nas are shown in Fig.(l) and Fig.(P). Each assembly comprises a magnetic core\n(A) and actuation coil (B), with a magnetic iron armature (C) pivoted on one\nleg of the core. The armature is in contact with a print wire (D) and is held\nin an equilibrium position by a return spring (E) such that a working air gap\n(F) exists between the armature and one leg of the core. Application of\nelectrical current to the coil results in a magnetic traction force tending to\nclose the working gap, thus accelerating the wire toward the print media (G).\nFig.(3) shows the magnetization curve, B vs. H, of the material used for\nboth the core and the armature, 3 percent Silicon Iron. To maximize the\nefficiency of the device it is necessary to operate at as high a magnetization\nlevel as possible, while keeping the permeability, p = B / H large. An accurate\nanalysis of the circuit will allow use of a current level just short of\nsaturating the armature or core. Ftg.(4) shows the permeability and also the\ndifferential permeability\nd B / d H of t h e material.\n\nB\n\nE\n\nI\n\nFig.(l): Rotating Armature Rlnth-d\n\n153\n\nType 1\n\n"Y\n\nr c\n\nE\n\n\'.\nFig.(2): RotaUng Armature Printhead\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n2\n\n0\n\nH (Oersteds)\n\nFig.(3): Magnethtion Curve of sillcon Iron\n\n154\n\nIO\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\nso\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n10\nI\n\n0\n\nn\no\n\n4\n\n2\n\n8\n\n6\n\n10\n\nH (Oersteds)\n\n+\n\nPSRUEABILITY\n\nDIFF.

It is customary to picture the circuit as the analog of an electrical\nnetwork in which the source of MMF is equivalent to a voltage source and\nthe various components of the magnetic circuit are analogous to electrical\nresistors. A schematic of the electrical analog of the magnetic circuit is\nshown in Fig.(S). The magnetomotive force (MMF) of the coil is readily\nobtained for any given current level, and a solution obtained by equating the\nmagnetic potential drop around the circuit to the MMF and combining this\nwith the condition of continuity of flux around the circuit to obtain the level\nof magnetic flux in the circuit:\n\n@ = Z n H ;1 ,\n\nThis approach neglects the fact that some flux passes through the air\nsurrounding\nthe assembly,\nand also treats\nthe source of flux a s a\ndiscontinuity in the Magnetic Potential @ at the center of the coil. It is also\ndifficult (although not impossible) to allow for variation in permeability due to\nnonlinear\nmaterial properties.\nFig.(6)\nshows the magnetic potential\nand\nmagnetic field in a close path around the circuit in actuality and using this\napproximation.\nActual\nModelled\n\nF&.(6): Magnetic Potential And Field around the Magnetic Circuit\n\n156\n\nTABLE 1: MAGNEXOSTATIC QUANTITIES\n\n1\n\nQUANTITY\n\nUNITS\n\nSYMBOL\n\nMAGNETIC POTENTIAL\n\nGILBERT\n\nMAGNETIC FIELD\n\nOERSTED\n\nMAGNETIC INDUCTION\n\nGAUSS\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX\n\nEQUATION\n\nMAXWELL\n\nRELATIVE PERMEABILITY\nMAGNETOMOTIVE FORCE\nENERGY DENSITY\n\nGILBERT\n\nu\n\nI\n\nGAUSS-OERSTED\n\n4 MODIFICATIONS To COSMIC NASTRAN To A L u ) W MODELLING OF NONLINEAR\nMAGNETIC MATERIAIS:\n\nNASTRAN already has the capability to model linear magnetic circuits,\nincluding the magnetic fields due to arbitrary\nconfigurations\nof current\nsources, using its existing heat transfer capabilities (1). The use of this\ncapability is described in the NASTRAN user\'s manual (2). The modification to\nallow modelling of nonlinear magnetic permeability involved the addition of\nmodules which, after a linear heat transfer solution is obtained and the\npotential gradient calculated for all elements, examines a table describing the\nmagnetization curve of the materia& such as in Fig.01, and assigns a new\nvalue to the element permeability. The element data in the element stiffness\ntable HKELM are multiplied by the ratio of old to new permeability values and\na new global stiffness table HKGG i formed from the updated HKELM. The heat\ns\ntransfer solution is now repeated for as many iterations as are required to\nobtain a converged\nsolution. The DMAP ALTER statements and additional\nsubprograms required have been described elsewhere (3).\nThere are several ways to interpret the magnetic field, H, all of which are\nequally valid. In the class of problems where an external source such as a\ncurrent loop or the earth\'s magnetic field provides the MMF, the component of\nH due to the source may be analytically calculated from the Biot-Savart\nequation:\n\nwhere H , is the field due to the current element dl at distance r.\nIn this approach NASTRAN is used to calculate the component of H due to\nthe presence of ferromagnetic materials, H m using\n\n157\n\nThis method is known as the reduced scalar potential method (RSP), and\nrefers to H , as the anomaly field in (2). The total field is\nHurwitz\nobtainable by summation of the two components. This approach has the great\nadvantage of allowing the modelling of arbitrary current sources, which need\nnot be located within the finite element model. It is described in considerable\ntheoretical detail by Simkin and Trowbridge in (4) and McDaniel et al. in ( 5 ) .\nA potential\nsource of error lies in the near-cancellation\nof H , a n d H , in\nregions of high permeability, for models containing air gaps. The vector\nsummation of these components is a small difference between two large\nnumbers, which is a classic receipt for arithmetic error. Although such errors\nare reported in ( 4 ) , using a special purpose program, the results in (5),\nusing MSC/NASTRAN were accurate\nfor the test cases examined, and\nCOSMIC/NASTRAN is expected to produce equally accurate results.\nThis\nmethod requires,\nhowever that the source of H , be decoupled from the\neffects of the anomaly field, which is not the case if a permanent magnet is\nmodelled, as the magnet is a nonlinear source of MMF which is affected by\nthe magnetic properties of its environs. While it is possible to model such a\nmagnet as a combination of coil and nonlinear material, as is, done, for\nexample, in the AOWMAGNETIC program, it has been preferred here to use\nthe total scalar potential approach historically used in permanent magnet\nwork, wherein the source of MMF is considered\nto have a negative\npermeability and B is opposite in sense to H. In this approach the field is\nrelated to potential simply by:\n\nJust as a coil combined with a magnetic material can simulate a magnet in the\nmethod described above, in the total scalar potential method the case of a\ncoil may be handled by replacing the coil with a magnet having appropriate\nmaterial properties.\nIf the coil modelled is around a high permeability\nmember, accurate results are also obtainable by introducing a discontinuity in\npotential at the coil center using a value obtained from equation (1). While\nthis is not as elegant as using negative permeability values for the materials\nenclosed by the coil, it has the advantage of requiring less computer time.\nWhile models having positive values of permeability require a 5 or 1 0 percent\ndamping factor in their iterative solution, a value of 90 percent has been\nfound adviseable for the modelling of negative permeability values using the\niteration scheme employed. An advantage of the reduced scalar potential\nmethod which must be noted is that the effects of arbitrary current sources\nwhich can be modelled using the Biot-Savart\nequation and reduced scalar\npotential method are not easily, if a t all, soluble using the total scalar\npotential method.\n5 GRAPHICAL DISPLAY\n\nOF MAGNETOSTATIC PARAMETERS:\n\nThe values of magnetic potential obtained from NASTRAN are calculated at\nnodes, but the permeability is clearly an element property. The values of B\nand H are obtained by differentiating\nthe potential, #, and they, and the\nderived energy density, U, are essentially element data. The module which\nupdates NASTRAN\'s element stiffness table HKELM outputs to a file a table of\nelement results consisting of the vector components of H and B, in addition to\npermeability and energy density, which can be directly read by the PATRAN\nfinite element analysis program, and graphically displayed by PATRAN. plates\n\n158\n\nTABLE 2: CAu=uLATED AND N A S I "\n\nFLUX LEVEE3\n\nIMF (GILBERT) :LUX (NASTRAN) :LUX (CALCULATION)\nMAX WELLS\nMAXWELLS\n20\n50\n100\n150\n200\n300\n350\n450\n\n145\n380\n770\n1160\n1430\n1659\n1771\n1992\n\n120\n280\n560\n840\n1100\n1200\n1250\n1350\n\nPARAMETERS FROM THE F " ELEMENT MODEL:\nIE\nThe electrical parameters of interest are the inductance of the circuit,\nwhich determines the rate of current rise when the coil is activated, and the\ncurrent level at which saturation occurs. In a nonlinear magnetic device the\ninductance varies with current level, and must be measured by a complex\nincremental method, but the initial inductance is well-defined\nand readily\nmeasured. Familiar formulae for the voltage across an inductor are:\n7 DERIVATION OF " R I C A L\n\nV = -L .di/dt\nV\n\n=-\n\nN . d&/dt\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nr is the potential difference across the cc\ni is the current, 1 is 1 h e\nnumber of turns and L is the inductance. Combining these equations gives:\n\nwhere\n\nwhere i may be related to MMF as shown in table (1). The coil has 320 turns,\ngiving an initial permeability value for the device of 9.9 mH, compared with a\nmeasured value of 9.2 mH. The variation is well within that to be expected\ndue to assembly variation. By calculating d i l d t for different current levels,\nthe current profile for a given applied transient voltage may be calculated\nusing equation (7). Fig.(9) shows a current profile for an applied voltage of\n58V using a current-limiting\ndriver circuit. The initial slope corresponds\nto\nthe measured and calculated values of inductance, while the tfkneetf in the\ncurve occurs at a current level of approximately 800-900 mA, or an MMF of\n256-320 Gilberts. This corresponds\nwell with the "knee" of the curve of\nFig.(8), which shows the circuit beginning to saturate at this level of MMF.\n\n159\n\n(2) through (lo), discussed below, are contour plots produced by PATRAN. Ir\ninterpreting these results it must be noted that PATRAN does not plot element\nresults but instead averages element data at shared nodes. This is correct ii\nthere are no discontinuities\nin the material properties\nof the model, but\nproduces\nspurious\neffects at boundaries\nbetween materials of different I\npermeability. The well-behaved slopes at the boundary between steel and aid\nin these figures should in reality be step-function\ndiscontinuities.\nFig47) 1\nshows a section through an iron component with magnetic field as calculated\nby NASTRAN, and the distortion\nas a result of nodal averaging\nSo long as\nthe component is more that one element wide the central value will be correct, I\nand will be representative\nof the value in the elements on either side of itj\nThe distortion in the plot can be reduced by location of very thin elements\nthe interface, so that the averaging effect will be confined to them, but at\nconsiderable cost in model size. The magnetic potential is written to PATRAN in\nnodal form using NASTRAN\'s OUTPUT2 module, and is not subject to distortion\nin plotting.\n\n.\n\nsf:\n\nAIR\n\nIRON\n\nI\n\nAIR\n\nI\n\n- ELEMENT\nVALUES\n--e\n\nNODAL\nVALUES\n\nFg() DISTORTING EFF\'ECT OF NODAL AVERAGING ON PuyrS OF ELEMENT\ni.7:\nDATA\n6 APPLICATION OF THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD TO THE ROTATING ARMATURE\nPRINlWMk\n\nModelling the coil as a discrete continuity as described above, there is a\nsignificant gain in accuracy to be had by replacing the simple circuit by a\nfinite element mesh consisting of elements representing both the ferromagnetic\nmaterials and the surrounding medium. This is particularly advantageous if, as\nin this case, we are interested\nin the behaviour of the material i the\nn\nsaturation region (the region of Fig.(J) where the slope of the curve begins to\nbecome small) and for complex geometries which cannot be modelled simply.\nPlate(1) shows a two-dimensional\nfinite element model of the armature and\n160\n\nI\n\ncore. Using single point constraints or loads a discontinuity can be created at\nthe center of the coil and the quantities B, H, V, p , V and U obtained\nvalues. The NASTRAN\nthroughout\nthe model for a range of discontinuity\nresults \xe2\x82\xacor this simple geometry are compared with values obtained by a\ngraphical approximation method in Table (2). Fig.($) is a plot of the curve of\nthe graphical solution with the NASTRAN results\nsuperimposed.\nBoth the\nNASTRAN analysis and the approximate calculation show that the behaviour of\nt h e system is linear for MMFs less than approximately 300.0 Gilbert. Contour\nplots of V, B, H, P and U show that the subsequent nonlinear behaviour is due\nto the onset of saturation of the armature. plates (2) to (10) show carpet plots\nof V, B, H, p and U for values of MMF below, above and at the knee of the\ncurve of Fig.(8). The results obtained show that agreement is fair between the\nhand calculation and t h e NASTRAN model for the unsaturated part of t h e curve\nbut less good for the saturation region.

Output of magnetic field\ndata to PATRAN allows the visualization of the magnetic field and flux paths\nwithin the system. The plots of permeability and of energy density are of\nparticular use in observing the onset of saturation in the iron parts of the\ncircuit, and in comprehending the behaviour of the device. The calculations of\nmagnetic traction force have a degree of accuracy which is unobtainable by\nconventional methods, and which is surprising in view of the simple nature of\nthe model. Of particular interest is the ability of the model to predict the\nelectrical behaviour of the device, which should allow the use of NASTRAN in\nconjunction with a circuit analysis package such as SPICE to predict t h e\ntransient and low frequency behaviour of circuits including nonlinear magnetic\ndevices such as power transformers, relays and other actuator mechanisms.\n\n163\n\nWhile it is unlikely that the agreement between NASTRAN and measured dat$\nin this case is fortuitous, similar analysis of other magnetomechanical devices1\nis required to fully validate the methods used and determine how generally1\nthey may be applied.\n\n10 REFERENCES:\n\n1\n\n(1).
