The most difficult task was to estimate the number of early tornadoes in 1916-50 when the reporting efficiency was very bad, resulting in undercounting of the incidents. In generating the best possible data, Fujita's Tornado Tape produced at the University of Chicago, the book Significant Tornadoes, 1880-1989, by Thomas P. Grazulis, and the NSSFC Tornado Tape were combined. First, the annual number of tornadoes were smoothed to obtain the smoothed number of annual tornadoes which was normalized to the standard number of tornadoes defined as the mean number in the recent 30 years 1960-89. The normalization factor was obtained by computing the ration of smoothed and standard number. In the early years, the factor was in excess of 7. Thereafter, the normalized number of annual tornadoes was computed and plotted, finding that the results are very satisfactory. In order to visualize the variation of tornado activities, the tornado activity number (TAN) was initiated and computed. The TAN including all annual tornadoes show certain periodicity. For climatological evaluation, the peak-activity day of each year, such as Superoutbreak day, 3 April 1974, Palm Sunday, 11 April 1965 were eliminated. The TAN, excluding peak-day tornadoes, is of extreme interest.", "title": "Climatic variation of storms", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930010895, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fujita, Ted"}, "organization": {"name": "Chicago Univ.", "location": "Chicago, IL, United States"}}, "id": "c58ddd5800564f4e91a481ea94e8ad54"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930010895, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930010895, "id": "f2555749cbe64241b5e404e72e0abe8e", "publicationName": "NASA.
