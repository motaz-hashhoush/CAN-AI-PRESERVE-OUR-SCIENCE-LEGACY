Condon1, Jacob Williams2\n1\n2\n\nNASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX 77058\n\nERC, Inc., JETS Contract Group, Houston, TX 77058\n\nIn 2010, the President announced that, in 2025, the U.S. intended to launch a human mission to an\nasteroid [1]. This announcement was followed by the idea of a Capability Driven Framework (CDF) [2],\nwhich is based on the idea of evolving capabilities from less demanding to more demanding missions to\nmultiple possible destinations and with increased flexibility, cost effectiveness and sustainability.\nFocused missions, such as a NASA inter-Center study that examined the viability and implications of\nsending a crew to a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) [3], provided a way to better understand and evaluate the\nutility of these CDF capabilities when applied to an actual mission. The long duration of the NEA\nmissions were contrasted with a concept described in a study prepared for the Keck Institute of Space\nStudies (KISS) [4] where a robotic spacecraft would redirect an asteroid to the Earth-Moon vicinity,\nwhere a relatively short duration crewed mission could be conducted to the captured asteroid. This\nmission concept was included in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) fiscal year\n2014 budget request, as submitted by the NASA Administrator [5]. NASA studies continued to examine\nthe idea of a crewed mission to a captured asteroid in the Earth-Moon vicinity. During this time was an\nannouncement of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Asteroid Grand Challenge [6]. Key goals for the Asteroid Grand Challenge\nare to locate, redirect, and explore an asteroid, as well as find and plan for asteroid threats. An Asteroid\nRedirect Mission (ARM) study was being conducted, which supports this Grand Challenge by providing\nunderstanding in how to execute an asteroid rendezvous, capture it, and redirect it to Earth-Moon space,\nand, in particular, to a distant retrograde orbit (DRO). Subsequent to the returning of the asteroid to a\nDRO, would be the launch of a crewed mission to rendezvous with the redirected asteroid. This report\nexamines that crewed mission by assessing the Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission (ARCM) nominal\ndesign and performance costs associated with an Orion based crewed rendezvous mission to a captured\nasteroid in an Earth-Moon DRO.\nThe ARM study includes two fundamental mission phases: 1) The Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission\n(ARRM) and 2) the ARCM. The ARRM includes a solar electric propulsion based robotic asteroid return\nvehicle (ARV) sent to rendezvous with a selected near Earth asteroid, capture it, and return it to a DRO in\nthe Earth-Moon vicinity. The DRO is selected over other possible asteroid parking orbits due to its\nachievability (by both the robotic and crewed vehicles) and by its stability (e.g., no orbit maintenance is\nrequired). After the return of the asteroid to the Earth-Moon vicinity, the ARCM is executed and carries a\ncrew of two astronauts to a DRO to rendezvous with the awaiting ARV with the asteroid. The outbound\nand inbound transfers employ lunar gravity assist (LGA) flybys to reduce the Orion propellant\nrequirement for the overall nominal mission, which provides a nominal mission with some reserve\npropellant for possible abort situations.\nThe nominal mission described in this report provides a better understanding of the mission\nconsiderations as well as the feasibility of such a crewed mission, particularly with regard to spacecraft\ncurrently undergoing development, such as the Orion vehicle and the Space Launch System (SLS).\n\n[1]\n\nObama, B.H., \xe2\x80\x9cRemarks by the President on Space Exploration in the 21st Century, \xe2\x80\x9cJohn F.\nKennedy Space Center, April 15, 2010, (http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarkspresident-space-exploration-21st-century).\n\n[2]\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuman Space Exploration Framework Summary\xe2\x80\x9d, National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, January 12, 2011,\n\n[3]\n\nDrake, B., \xe2\x80\x9cStrategic Implications of Human Exploration of Near-Earth Asteroids\xe2\x80\x9d,\nIEEAC Paper 1069; JSC-CN-25037, IEEE 2012 Aerospace Conference, Big Sky, MT,\n3-10 Mar. 2012, United States.\n\n[4]\n\nBrophy, J., Culick, F., Friedman, L., et al., \\Asteroid Retrieval Feasibility Study," Technical\nReport, Keck Institute for Space Studies, California Institute of Technology, Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory, April 2012.\n\n[5]\n\nRamsey, S., Kraft, R., \xe2\x80\x9cNASA Announces Asteroid Grand Challenge\xe2\x80\x9d, Release: 13-188, NASA\nHQ, June 18, 2013. http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2013/jun/HQ_13188_Asteroid_Grand_Challenge.html\n\n[6]\n\n6/18/13: NASA Announces Asteroid Grand Challenge Release: 12-188, NASA HQ\n\nChronology\n1) 4/15/10: President announces U.S. (et. al.?) will send first crew to an asteroid.
