b'Network Coordinator\n\nNVI, Inc.\n\nNetwork Coordinator Report\nEd Himwich, Richard Strand\nAbstract\nThis report includes an assessment of the network performance in terms of lost observing time\nfor the 2012 calendar year. Overall, the observing time loss was about 12.3%, which is in-line with\nprevious years. A table of relative incidence of problems with various subsystems is presented. The\nmost signi\xef\xac\x81cant identi\xef\xac\x81ed causes of loss were electronics rack problems (accounting for about 21.8%\nof losses), antenna reliability (18.1%), RFI (11.8%), and receiver problems (11.7%). About 14.2% of\nthe losses occurred for unknown reasons. New antennas are under development in the USA, Germany,\nand Spain. There are plans for new telescopes in Norway and Sweden. Other activities of the Network\nCoordinator are summarized.\n\n1. Network Performance\nThe overall network performance was for the most part good. This year we return to reporting\na detailed assessment, which was not provided for the two previous years.\nThis network performance report is based on correlator reports for experiments in calendar year\n2012. This report includes results for the 148 24-hour experiments that had detailed correlator\nreports available as of March 8, 2013. The data set examined includes approximately 500,000\ndual frequency observations. Results for 16 experiments were omitted because either they were\ncorrelated at the VLBA, they have not been correlated yet, or correlation reports were not available\non the IVS data centers. Experiments processed at the VLBA correlator were omitted because\nthe information provided for them is not as detailed as that from Mark IV correlators. The\nexperiments that have not been correlated or do not have correlator reports available yet include\nsome JADE, JAXA, OHIG, R&D, T2, and EUR experiments. In summary, roughly 90% of the\ndata from scheduled 24 hour experiments for 2012 are included in this report. That is similar to,\nand actually a little more complete than, the coverage of reports for previous years.\nAn important point to understand is that in this report, the network performance is expressed\nin terms of lost observing time. This is straightforward in cases where the loss occurred because\noperations were interrupted or missed. However, in other cases, it is more complicated to calculate.\nTo handle this, a non-observing time loss is typically converted into an equivalent lost observing\ntime by expressing it as an approximate equivalent number of recorded bits lost. As an example,\na warm receiver will greatly reduce the sensitivity of a telescope. The resulting performance will\nbe in some sense equivalent to the station having a cold receiver but observing for (typically)\nonly one-third of the nominal time and therefore recording the equivalent of only one-third of\nthe expected bits. In a similar fashion, poor pointing can be converted into an equivalent lost\nsensitivity and then equivalent fraction of lost bits. Poor recordings are simply expressed as the\nfraction of total recorded bits lost.\nUsing correlator reports, an attempt was made to determine how much observing time was lost\nat each station and why. This was not always straightforward to do. Sometimes the correlator\nnotes do not indicate that a station had a particular problem, while the quality code summary\nindicates a signi\xef\xac\x81cant loss. Reconstructing which station or stations had problems\xe2\x80\x94and why\xe2\x80\x94in\nthese circumstances does not always yield accurate results. Another problem was that it is hard\nto determine how much RFI a\xef\xac\x80ected the data, unless one or more channels were removed and that\n60\n\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\nNVI, Inc.\n\nNetwork Coordinator\n\neliminated the problem. It can also be di\xef\xac\x83cult to distinguish between BBC and RFI problems.\nFor individual station days, the results should probably not be assumed to be accurate at better\nthan the 5% level.\nThe results here should not be viewed as an absolute evaluation of the quality of each station\xe2\x80\x99s\nperformance. As mentioned above, the results themselves are only approximate. In addition, some\nproblems such as weather and power failures are beyond the control of the station. Instead the\nresults should be viewed in aggregate as an overall evaluation of what percentage of the observing\ntime the network is collecting data successfully. Development of the overall result is organized\naround individual station performance, but the results for individual stations do not necessarily\nre\xef\xac\x82ect the quality of operations at that station.\nSince stations typically observe with more than one other station at a time, the average lost\nobserving time per station is not equal to the overall average loss of VLBI data. Under some\nsimplifying assumptions, the average loss of VLBI data is roughly twice the average loss of station observing time. This approximation is described in the Network Coordinator\xe2\x80\x99s section of\nthe IVS 2001 Annual Report. For 2012, this agrees reasonably well with the actual number of\n(single frequency: S or X) single baseline observations on which the correlator reported failure,\napproximately 21.1%, but other factors, particularly the dual frequency nature of useful geodetic\nobservations, complicate the picture. For 2012, the actual percentage of data (dual frequency) that\nwas not included by the analysts was approximately 28.1%. This is even larger (by approximately\n34%) than the single baseline observations reported lost by the correlator. It is expected that this\nnumber should be higher because the analysts use additional criteria beyond what is discussed\nhere to decide when to exclude observations. However, it means in e\xef\xac\x80ect that only about 72% of\nthe observations we attempted to collect were useful.\nFor the 148 experiments from 2012 examined here, there were 1,261 station days or approximately 8.5 stations per experiment on average. This compares to 135 experiments considered in\nthe report for 2009 (the most recent year with a detailed report), which included 1,051 station days\nwith 7.9 stations per experiment. The increase in the number of analyzed experiments essentially\njust re\xef\xac\x82ects that the results for more experiments were available for consideration at the time the\nreport was written. However the increase in the number of stations per experiment is probably\ndue to a concerted e\xef\xac\x80ort by the IVS Coordinating Center to make the networks in the experiments\nlarger. The onset of operations by the AuScope and Warkworth stations helped to make this\npossible. Of the station days for 2012, approximately 12.3% (or approximately 155 days) of the\nobserving time was lost. For comparison to reports from earlier years, please see Table 1.\nThe lost observing time for 2012 is more in-line with results from years before 2009. The results\nfor 2009 may be arti\xef\xac\x81cially high due to a change in the way the results were tabulated for that\nyear. We believe this year\xe2\x80\x99s calculations are more in-line with how they were made before 2009.\nAn assessment of each station\xe2\x80\x99s performance is not provided in this report. While individual\nstation information was presented in some previous years, this practice seemed to be counterproductive. Although many caveats were provided to discourage people from assigning too much\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cance to the results, there was feedback that suggested that the results were being overinterpreted. Additionally, some stations reported that their funding could be placed in jeopardy\nif their performance appeared bad, even if it was for reasons beyond their control. Last and least,\nthere seemed to be some interest in attempting to \xe2\x80\x9cgame\xe2\x80\x9d the analysis methods to improve station\nresults. Consequently, only summary results are presented here. Detailed results are presented to\nthe IVS Directing Board. Each station can receive the results for their station by contacting the\n\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\n61\n\nNetwork Coordinator\n\nNVI, Inc.\n\nTable 1.

The distinction between\nthese two groups was made on the assumption that the results would be more meaningful for the\nstations with more experiments. The average observing time loss from the large N group was\nmuch smaller than the average from the small N group, 10.6% versus 25.7%. There are many more\nstation days in the large N group than the small N group, 1,125 versus 136, so the large N group\nis dominant in determining the overall performance.\nThere are 19 stations in the large N group. Nine stations observed in 50 or more experiments.\nOf the 19, eight stations successfully collected data for approximately 90% or more of their expected\nobserving time. Nine more stations collected 80% or more of the time. The two remaining stations\ncollected data for more than about 60% of their observing time. These results are not signi\xef\xac\x81cantly\ndi\xef\xac\x80erent from previous years.\nThere are 24 stations in the small N group. The range of lost observing time for stations in\nthis category was 0%-100%. The median loss rate was approximately 11.3%, better than previous\nyears.\nThe losses were also analyzed by sub-system for each station. Individual stations can contact\nthe Network Coordinator (Ed.Himwich@nasa.gov) for the sub-system breakdown (and overall loss)\nfor their station. A summary of the losses by sub-system (category) for the entire network is\npresented in Table 2. This table includes results since 2003 sorted by decreasing loss in 2012.\nThe categories in Table 2 are rather broad and require some explanation, which is given below.\nAntenna This category includes all antenna problems, including mis-pointing, antenna control\ncomputer failures, non-operation due to wind, and mechanical breakdowns of the antenna.\n62\n\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\nNVI, Inc.\n\nNetwork Coordinator\n\nTable 2.

Maser problems and\ncoherence problems that could be attributed to the Maser were also included in this category.\nPhase instabilities reported for Kokee were included in this category.\nMiscellaneous This category includes several small problems that do not \xef\xac\x81t into other categories,\nmostly problems beyond the control of the stations, such as power (only prior to 2012),\n(non-wind) weather, cables, scheduling con\xef\xac\x82icts at the stations, and errors in the observing\nschedule provided by the Operation Centers. For 2006 and 2007, this category also includes\nerrors due to tape operations at the stations that were forced to use tape because either they\ndid not have a disk recording system or they did not have enough media. All tape operations\nhave since ceased. This category is dominated by weather and scheduling con\xef\xac\x82ict issues.\nOperations This category includes all operational errors, such as DRUDG-ing the wrong schedule, starting late because of shift problems, operator (as opposed to equipment) problems\nchanging recording media, and other problems.\nPower This category includes data lost due to power failures at the sites. Prior to 2012, losses\ndue to power failures were included in the Miscellaneous category.\nRack This category includes all failures that could be attributed to the rack (DAS) including the\nformatter and BBCs. There is some di\xef\xac\x83culty in distinguishing BBC and RFI problems in\nthe correlator reports, so some losses are probably mis-assigned between the Rack category\nand the RFI category.\nReceiver This category includes all problems related to the receiver, including outright failure,\nloss of sensitivity because the cryogenics failed, design problems that impact the sensitivity,\nLO failure, and loss of coherence that was due to LO problems. In addition, for lack of a more\nclearly accurate choice, loss of sensitivity due to upper X band Tsys and roll-o\xef\xac\x80 problems\nwere assigned to this category.\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\n63\n\nNetwork Coordinator\n\nNVI, Inc.\n\nRecorder This category includes problems associated with data recording systems. Starting with\n2006, no problems associated with tape operations are included in this category.\nRFI This category includes all losses directly attributable to interference, including all cases of\namplitude variations in individual channels, particularly at S-band. There is some di\xef\xac\x83culty\nin distinguishing BBC and RFI problems in the correlator reports, so some losses are probably\nmis-assigned between the Rack category and the RFI category.\nShipping This category includes all observing time lost because the media were lost in shipping\nor held up in customs or because problems with electronic transfer prevented the data from\nbeing correlated with the rest of the experiment\xe2\x80\x99s data.\nSoftware This category includes all instances of software problems causing observing time to be\nlost. This includes crashes of the Field System, crashes of the local station software, and\nerrors in \xef\xac\x81les generated by DRUDG.\nUnknown This category is a special category for cases where the correlator did not state the\ncause of the loss and it was not possible to determine the cause with a reasonable amount of\ne\xef\xac\x80ort.\nInteresting results for 2012 include the fact that the largest source of losses was due to \xe2\x80\x9cRack\xe2\x80\x9d\nproblems, (21.8%). About half the loss in this category is associated with DBBCs, which were in\nuse at several stations in the Southern Hemisphere. The remaining rack problems were largely due\nto problems at stations with aging racks for which replacement parts are hard to \xef\xac\x81nd. However,\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cant improvements were made at two of the three stations with these problems by the end\nof the year.\nThe next largest area of loss was \xe2\x80\x9cAntenna\xe2\x80\x9d problems (18.1%). This is down signi\xef\xac\x81cantly\nfrom previous years and re\xef\xac\x82ects the fact that there were no lengthy outages due to catastrophic\nantenna failures. Stations with signi\xef\xac\x81cant antenna problems were Matera, Svetloe, Tsukuba, and\nYarragadee.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cRFI\xe2\x80\x9d losses (11.8%) were more back in-line with years before 2009. The higher value in\n2009 may be related to di\xef\xac\x80erences in how the losses were treated that year. The stations with the\nmost serious RFI problems were Fortaleza and Matera.\n\xe2\x80\x9cReceiver\xe2\x80\x9d sub-system problems (11.7%) was lower than in previous years. For 2012 this is\nprobably due to fewer cryogenic problems, due partly to several new stations having uncooled\nreceivers.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cMiscellaneous\xe2\x80\x9d category loss was smaller than previous years. This was to a small extent\ndue to the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cPower\xe2\x80\x9d was broken out as a separate category this year, but this does not\naccount for the majority of the change.\nOverall, while the network operated well for the most part, there are a few notable issues (in\nalphabetical order of station), while some situations improved from the previous year:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fortleza RFI for channel SR4U caused almost 15% data loss for that station over the year.\nAn attempt to \xef\xac\x81x this by bandpass \xef\xac\x81ltering the RFI signal in the station\xe2\x80\x99s S-band IF did\nnot work.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hobart26 is now observing without a phase calibration antenna unit.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hobart, Katherine, and Yarragadee have timing issues with the DBBC back-ends. These\ncause occasional clock breaks and data gaps when they occur. The manufacturer is investigating this issue.\n64\n\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\nNVI, Inc.\n\nNetwork Coordinator\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Kokee Park\xe2\x80\x99s damaged gearbox was repaired and was re-installed. This improved the antenna\xe2\x80\x99s pointing and its SEFDs but did not return them to their normal levels. There are still\nproblems with both azimuth gearboxes, which will need to be repaired. The station replaced\nthe AC wiring going to the telescope to prevent the cryogenic compressor from tripping o\xef\xac\x80.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The receiver at Medicina warmed up in November 2011. It is not clear when it will be\nrepaired.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Matera\xe2\x80\x99s Mark 5 samplers for S-band channels 5 and 6 have failed. E\xef\xac\x80orts are being made\nto locate replacements. Matera had an antenna failure that was repaired.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 After completion of its bearing repair, the Noto antenna started observing again in May\n2012. Noto also repaired its BBCs, so that it has at most one or two bad BBCs now. In any\nevent, it is expected that Noto will replace its aging VLBA4 rack with a DBBC in 2013.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ny-\xcb\x9alesund\xe2\x80\x99s receiver communications were repaired using the system that the TIGO station\nA\ndeveloped for their receiver, which had the same original design.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Svetloe had intermittent antenna problems that caused occasional data losses. Badary and\nZelenchukskaya\xe2\x80\x99s antenna reliability has improved.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 TIGO has shown higher than normal SEFDs for several years. There has been no success in\nresolving this issue.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Tskuba32 telescope had a major structural failure and was repaired.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Warkworth lost most of the scans scheduled for 2012 because of a maser failure, now repaired.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Westford azimuth antenna drives continue to trip o\xef\xac\x80 sometimes when the site is unattended.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Yarragadee solved its antenna problems by installing a bandpass \xef\xac\x81lter in a diplexer to eliminate the need to stow the antenna when a satellite up-link is active.\n\n2. New Stations\nThere are prospects for new stations on several fronts. These include (in approximate order of\nhow soon they will start regular observations):\n\xe2\x80\xa2 At GSFC in the USA, a new 12-m antenna has been erected and is undergoing testing. While\nthis antenna is primarily for use in the development of the VGOS systems, it is expected\nthat it will eventually join the network for regular observing.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 At Wettzell in Germany, construction of the new Twin Telescope Wettzell (TTW) for VGOS\nis underway and is expected to be commissioned in April 2013.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 At Arecibo in Puerto Rico a new 12-m antenna has been erected and is expected to be used\nfor geodetic observing.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In Spain/Portugal, the RAEGE (Atlantic Network of Geodynamical and Space Stations)\nproject aims to establish a network of four fundamental geodetic stations including radio\ntelescopes that will ful\xef\xac\x81ll the VGOS speci\xef\xac\x81cations: Yebes (1), Canary Islands (1), and Azores\n(2).\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\n65\n\nNetwork Coordinator\n\nNVI, Inc.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In Norway, the Norwegian Mapping Authority (NMA) has received initial funding for a\nproject to establish a fundamental station at Ny-\xcb\x9alesund, which will include a twin telescope\nA\nof the Wettzell type.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Onsala has applied for funds for a twin telescope system.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In Russia, an e\xef\xac\x80ort is underway to get 12-m VGOS antennas at some of the QUASAR\nnetwork sites.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Korea is planning to build one antenna primarily for geodesy (Korea VLBI system for\nGeodesy, KVG) at Sejong. There is also interest in geodetic use of the Korean VLBI Network\n(KVN), which will consist of three stations intended primarily for astronomy.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There is interest in India in building a network of four telescopes that would be useful for\ngeodesy.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Saudi Arabia is investigating having a combined geodetic observatory, which would presumably include a VLBI antenna.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Colombia is investigating having a combined geodetic observatory, which would presumably\ninclude a VLBI antenna.\nMany of these antennas may become available for use in the next few years. E\xef\xac\x80orts are being\nmade to ensure that these antennas will be compatible with VGOS.\n\n3. Network Coordination Activities\nNetwork coordination involved dealing with various network and data issues.
