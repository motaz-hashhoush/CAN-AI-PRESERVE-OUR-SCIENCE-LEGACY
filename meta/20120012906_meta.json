Next we see shots of various parades welcoming the three astronauts home. Following these celebrations, we see the Lunar Receiving Lab, where the Lunar rocks are processed, and the various questions that science hopes to begin to answer about the moon, the development of the solar system and the evolution of life on earth, with the close examination of the rocks are asked.", "title": "Moonwalk Series", "stiType": "VIDEO", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-26T02:45:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Video", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20120012906, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "http://youtu.be/nh0FvK-Kc8E", "type": "URL"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120012906, "id": "a4fd4837cffc4eb0893616a7a82b9495", "publicationDate": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
