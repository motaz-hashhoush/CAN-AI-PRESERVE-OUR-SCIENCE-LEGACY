A Crawler Transporter (CT)\nthen carries the MLP and the stacked vehicle (12 million pounds total weight) to the launch complex located 5 miles away.\nThis operation is performed at 0.9 mph resulting in a 4.5-hour transport. A recent test was performed to monitor the dynamic\nenvironment that was produced during rollout. It was found that the rollout is a harmonic-rich dynamic environment that was\npreviously not understood.\nThis paper will describe work that has been performed to estimate the forcing function that is produced in the transportation\nprocess. The rollout analysis team has determined that there are two families of harmonics of the drive train, which excite the\nsystem as a function of CT speed. There are also excitation sources, which are random or narrow-band in frequency and are\nnot a function of CT speed. This presentation will discuss the application of the Sum of Weighted Accelerations Technique\n(SWAT) to further refine this understanding by estimating the forces and moments at the center-of-mass.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Space Shuttle vehicle is comprised of several major elements during launch: the manned Orbiter with the Space Shuttle\nMain Engines (SSME\'s), two reusable Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB\'s), and the External Tank (ET) that connects everything\ntogether. This entire three million pound stack is mounted to an eight million pound Mobile Launch Platform (MLP) and\ncarried to the launch pad by the one million pound Crawler Transporter (CT). Figure 1 shows this process underway at the\ntypical rollout speed of 0.9 miles per hour (mph).\nThe rollout has been considered a relatively benign environment during most of the life of the Shuttle System. However, as\nthe System ages and more emphasis has been placed on understanding the fatigue characteristics, this assumption has become\na aubjw~ validation. Ah the technical cvn~munity g a ~to study this environment, the rollout forcing fun\'ctinn was fnund\nfur\nh\n~\nto contain a fairly rich spectrum.\nA series of tests were performed in November of 2003 to develop the data necessary to understand the dynamic environment\nof Rollout and the response of the Space Shuttle Vehicle [l, 21. The hardware used in these tests consisted of an MLP and a\nCT as well as a partial stack. This partial stack consisted of two SRB\'s and a crossbeam forming the upper interface. This\ncrossbeam is a component that is normally embedded in an ET. Figure 2 shows the configuration. It should be noted that\nthis configuration contains all but 250,000 pounds of the 12 million pound stack. However, the missing Orbiter and ET do\nadd significant stiffness and dynamics to the stack.\nData was acquired on the system at several different speeds (0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8, and 0.9 mph). There were nine channels of\nacceleration (three sets of triaxial sensors) acquired on each SRJ3 (18 total). There were an additional 20 locations (60\nchannels) with triaxial measurements on the MLP. These are the 78 channels of data that were of most interest in this work.\nAdditionally the SRBIMLP interface was monitored with additional strain gauges and the CT had nine additional locations\nwith triaxial measurements. Wind speed and direction, CT speed, and pressures in the hydraulics that lift the MLP were also\nmonitored [ I].\n\nFigure 1. Space Shuttle Stack During Rollout\n7.-\n\nFigure 2. Partial Stack During Rollout Testing\n\nSignificant follow-on work has been underway to develop and apply the Rollout forcing functions studied in these tests to\npredict vehicle response [3-41. The work reported herein represents one aspect of these efforts. Specifically, the authors have\nbeen using a force reconstruction technique developed at Sandia National Laboratories called the Sum of Weighted\nAcceleration Technique [5] or SWAT to estimate the forcing function operating on the MLP and partial stack during the\nRollout tests. An estimate of the forcing function will be used to understand the causes and effects of the transportation\nenvironment It is also hypothesized that the partial stack forcing function will be very similar to the full stack forcing\nfunction. This is primarily due to the fact that the dynamics of the stack will not significantly affect the input forces. The\nalternative (and primary analysis approach for full stack rollout) is to use a set of base drive accelerations to drive the system.\nThis approach is initially easier to implement and has been used historically in this situation. However the acceleration\ninputs will not be directly transferable from the partial stack rollout test to the full stack vehicle rollout because of the\nchanging dynamics of the stack due to the missing mass and stiffness and the resulting modal differences [4].\n\nSWAT FORCES AT THE CENTER OF GRAVITY\nSWAT combines measured accelerations multiplied by scalar weights to produce estimated forces. The weights, which\nappropriately sum the accelerations, are chosen to filter out the system dynamics, retaining the acceleration of the center-ofmass as described by the rigid body modes of the system. Knowledge of the mass and mass moments of inertia then allows\nNewton\'s law to be applied to estimate the forcing functions summed together at the center of gravity (CG) [5].\n\nis\nWhere Em is the six Degree-Of-Freedom (DOF) CG force vector, M is the rigid body mass matrix, and gg the acceleration\nvector at the CG Reference [6] covers the development of SWAT in detail. However, an abbreviated development of the\ntheory begins with the relationship that the measured acceleration time histories 0can be described as a summation of\naccelerations of modal participations ( p ) and mode shapes ( p . ) as shown in Equation 2:\n-I\n\nAfter converting the standard structural equations of motion into modal space and assessing only the contributions of the rigid\nbody modes, the stiffness and damping properties of the structure vanish. The inertial properties of the structure describe the\nresponse to externally applied forces as shown in equation (3):\n\nWhere:\nm,\n\nIs the mass property of a rigid body mode,\n\np, Is the modal acceleration of the rigid body mode,\n\n4\n-r\n\nIs the rigid body mode shape,\n\nf(t) Is the external force vector.\nEquation (3) is a manifestation of the basic premise of reference (6): "Knowledge of the rigid-body modal coordinates is\nsufficient to determine the sum of all externally applied forces".\nAs mentioned previously, a weighted summation of the accelerations will be used to create a generalized DOF as in equation\n(4):\ns i ( t ) = C w i k o kt )= E i T\n(\n\n*&).\n\nk\n\nWhere si is a generalized coordinate and is a weight vector. Substituting (2) into (4) and rearranging, the following\ndescription of the generalized coordinate is pi-udwd:\n\nNow the proper selection of weights will allow the generalized coordinate (s) to be interpreted as an acceleration of a DOF of\nthe center-of-mass (acG). Specifically, the weights must be chosen such that the product of the weights with all retained\nelastic modes and all non-desired rigid body modes are null. The weight matrix is normalized such that the product with the\ndesired rigid body DOF is 1.0 as shown in equation (6):\n\nWhere 6, is the delta function which is only a non-zero value (1.0) if i = k. The user must be careful in the choice of sensor\nlocations and the subset of included modes to assure that equation (6) can be solved for the weights of interest. It is critically\nimportant that the mode shape matrix not be singular or ill-conditioned with respect to the measurement locations. Reference\n[6] and other papers by the SWAT developers should be used to develop a proper understanding of the intricacies of\ndetermining SWAT weights.\nSubstituting (6) into (5) and equating to (3) results in:\n\nAnd finally equation (7) and equation (1) can be combined after multiplying (7) by the mass property and relating the sum of\nthe forces at the CG:\n\nNote that if the rigid body mode of interest is a translation mode, then the mass property is the total mass of the system and\nthe force is the sum of all external forces in that direction. If the rigid body mode is a rotational mode, then the mass property\nis the mass moment of inertia about the axis of rotation and the force is the sum of all moments about that same axis. Hence,\nsix sets of weights and rigid body properties are required to develop a complete description of the sum of all external forces.\n\nSWAT FORCES FOR THE PARTIAL STACK/MLP OPERATING AT .9 MPH\nSWAT forces at the CG of the partial stack were developed using 78 accelerometer channels on the SRB\'s and the MLP. The\nweights were developed using the six rigid body modes along with the first ten flex modes of the system (up to 4.22 Hz) as\nproduced by the free-free model of the partial stack system. It should be noted that the CT was not modeled in the system and\nis considered the source of the input forces. Figures 3 - 8 provide these six SWAT traces (three forces and three moments)\nwhile the system is moving at .9 mph. The upper plot is the time domain and the lower plot is the associated autospectrum.\nThe force plots (Figures 3-5) suggest that net forces in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 lbs are imposed on the system.\nAlthough several peaks are seen in Figures 3-8, the critical first harmonics at .56 and .9 Hz are visible as well as the dominant\npeak at 2.7 Hz [l].\n\nSWAT FORCE COMPARISON TO JEL FORCES AS ESTIMATED FROM PRESSURES\nThe Space Shuttle System CT includes a hydraulic system that lifts the MLP and vehicle stack called the Jacking, Elevation,\nand Leveling (EL) system. There are eight independent pressure systems (two sets of two 20 inch diameter pistons at each\ncorner of the CT). During the Partial Stack Rollout tests, the pressures in these hydraulic systems were measured. This can\nbe directly related to the forces in the X direction (vertical). These forces were summed and scaled to convert pressure to\nforce (assuming that each piston is 20 inches in diameter). The comparison between this measurement of X force and that\ndeveloped from SWAT is shown in Figure 9. Note that the overall magnitude of the E L force is very similar to that of the\nSWAT force at the dominant 2.7 Hz harmonic. Also, the relative character of the traces looks very similar. Figure 10\nprovides the autospectrum representation of the time domain data in Figure 9. The frequency representation of the data\nsupports the observation that the character of the data is very similar although there are differences. However, the magnitudes\nin Figure 10 are squared functions and the differences are accentuated. The trend seen in the Figure 10 comparisons could be\ndue to model errors (which will manifest themselves in incorrect SWAT weights) or an incomplete understanding of the\nconversion of JEL pressures to force. Also, to further enhance the frequency fidelity of the SWAT forces, more sensors or a\nnil)re lincarly indclxndcnr wt of ~ncu~urcmcrit\nltxations would h ~ t tr) l u v c bccn u~jlizcd.\nc\n\nXld\nE-\n\nFigure 3.

There are two sowces of potential error that must be\nconsidered when performing such a comparison. First, the NASTRAN model is not expected to be a perfect representation of\nreality. The complexity of the structwe and the lack of ability to perform extensive modal testsJmode1correlation limit the\nability of the model to exactly match reality. SWAT is somewhat immune to this issue, as the technique does not require an\nexact match of modal frequency. The retained modes of the actual system only have to be spanned by the retained modes of\nthe model. However, the model inconsistencies will still be a factor when using it to predict structural responses. Second,\nthe SWAT forces must be applied at the CG Since the model does not have a load-carrying node at that location, rigid links\nto the actual force interface locations (the four CT/MLP interface points) are required. This artificially increases the stiffness\nof the MLP. It is also important to note that the system modes used to develop these SWAT weights were estimated from a\nmodel without the CG node or the rigid links. Figures 11 and 12 illustrate the range of these comparisons.\nFigure 11 is an example of the least favorable comparisons and is typical of measwements from the MLP. This location is on\nthe left side of the MLP as the vehicle rolls toward the pad. Note that there is significant variation at the lower frequencies in\nthe Y (lateral) and Z (travel) directions. At the higher frequencies, some peaks are captured well, but the general trend is a\nlower analytical response. It should be noted that the MLP model has undergone less rigor in dynamic testing and correlation\nthan the flight elements of the Space Shuttle System. This situation is further degraded by the application of false rigid body\nlinks that were needed to apply the SWAT forces to the CG of the model. On the positive side, the contribution of the MLP to\nthe elastic modes of the system is limited until 4.5 Hz.\nFigwe 12 provides a much more positive result. These data are in the Z direction (direction of travel) at the top of the righthand SRB. This result is typical for the SRB locations in this test. Note that the test and analysis correlate well. In fact this is\nan important result as this location is very near one of the attach points for the ETIOrbiter and is potentially more indicative of\nthe fidelity that a full stack analysis might have. The SRB\'s have been subjected to much more diagnostic testing and model\ncorrelation than the MLP model. Also, at these frequencies and excitation levels, the SRB is a simpler structwe to model than\nthe MLP.\n\nSWAT-ESTIMATEDFORCING FUNCTION AS A FUNCTION OF ROLLOUT SPEED\nRollout data was acquired for constant speed rollouts at .5, .6, .7, .8, and .9 mph. Figwes 13-18 are plots of the six SWAT CG\nload components vs. rollout speed. The frequency content is almost entirely comprised of harmonics of 0.59 times the rollout\nspeed and harmonics of 0.975 times the rollout speed (Reference [I]). Both families of harmonics overlay for the harmonic\nrunning from 1.3 Hz thru 2.7 Hz in the plots, making that harmonic the dominant sowce of excitation. While the specifics of\nthe excitation source for the two harmonic families are not fully understood, the plots are a testament that the two harmonic\nfamilies do exist. The harmonic excitation sowce may involve some interaction between the crawler tracks and the ground.\nThe peak at the 2.7 Hz harmonic while traveling at .9 mph shows a significant increase in the X direction (vertical) as this\nspeed is approached (Figure 13). This harmonic appears dominant for a wider range of speeds in the Y direction (lateral Figwe 14) and the X moment (yaw - Figwe 16). The Z direction (travel - Figwe 15). the Y moment (pitch - Figwe 17). and\nZ moment (roll - Figwe 18) show strong contributions at the fundamental harmonics. In general, the contributions of the\nsystem elastic modes have been effectively filtered out by SWAT (although the peak at .8 mph in Figwe 18 may be an\nexception).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSWAT has been used to extract forcing function estimates from the acceleration measwements of the Rollout Test data. This\nwas accomplished by utilizing the free-free model of the partial stack attached to the MLP. The modes for this system were\nused to develop the SWAT weights. In an ideal world, the weights would have been developed from test data in the modal,\nfrequency, or time domain. However, performing a free-free test on the 11.7 million pound system is cost and technology\nprohibitive. Hence, the user must be aware that model errors may be present in the estimated SWAT forces. Also in an ideal\nworld, pre-test analysis would have been performed to place the sensors at locations to allow the selection of SWAT weights\nfrom the largest set of modes as possible. However, in spite of these shortcomings, the resulting forces are able to reproduce\nmany of the necessary aspects of the real forcing function such as frequencies and amplitudes of the critical harmonics;\nvariability with respect to the CT speed; lack of modal frequency content; and reproduction of critical response accelerations.\n\n0.9 MPH Grid 14164= Accd 15, ( 7.25 -798 1119).

This provides a unique check of the estimated SWAT forces. The SWAT force reproduced the major harmonics of the\nJEL force. However, it was found that the overall amplitudes of the SWAT forces were off by an approximate factor of two.\nThere was also a trend of a higher SWAT force at higher frequencies. However, this is not surprising as only a limited number\nof modes were used in the generation of the SWAT weights.\nThe final verification of the applicability of rollout forces involves the response output of the system model when driven with\nthe extracted forces. The work reported herein compared model output at . mph to measured accelerations. The responses\n9\non the SRB\'s were matched well, while the MLP responses were more deficient. This could be due to model errors or to the\nlimitations in the modal response of the SWAT forces. The SRB-dominated modes begin at .45 Hz, while the MLPdominated modes begin at 4.5 Hz. Since the SWAT weights were necessarily skewed to the lower frequencies, it is not\nunexpected that the SRB accelerations were matched with higher fidelity. It should also be noted that some elements of the\nShuttle Vehicle that were not present during the test (the ET and the Orbiter) are attached to the SRB\'s and not the MLP.\nHence, the reproduction of the SRB responses is considered a critical indicator of goodness. It should also be noted that the\nSRB models are more highly correlated. There have been multiple opportunities during ground tests, static firings, and flight\nto verify SRB modes. The dynamics of the MLP have not been studied to the extent of the flight elements until recently. It\nshould also be noted that the direct application of SWAT forces, requires artificial stiffness must be added to the MLP to\nconnect a CG node to the actual force interface locations. This degrades the fidelity of the MLP model even further.\nThe SWAT approach was used to generate forcing functions at multiple speeds. This allows a clear visualization of the\nincreasing force magnitudes that are generated as the speed of the rollout is increased. This information will be coupled with\nknowledge of full stack modal frequency locations to assess the level of resonance excitation that is expected during a typical\nrollout. This information will also be extremely helpful in choosing a rollout speed that will assure that fatigue life of Shuttle\ncomponents are not affected by rollout.\nThere are several follow-on activities suggested by this work. First, the six DOF SWAT forces need to be decomposed into\nequivalent forces at the MLPICT interface points. This will more closely model reality and negate the need to add artificial\nstiffness to the MLP model. Second, an analytical representation of the forcing function needs to be developed. Amplitude,\nphase, and input shape parameters as a function of CT speed need to be developed. This will then allow the forcing function\nto be tailored for use on analysis of the historical full stack rollouts, which is the third follow-on activity.\nThere are two more follow-on activities that are suggested and should be pursued as time allows. The system used for all of\nthe rollout analysis to date does not include a model of the CT. However, the testing has shown that the CT is an active part\nof the system. SWAT forces should be generated for a system that includes a model of the CT. A comparison to the current\nSWAT forces will then allow an assessment of the need to include such a model in subsequent rollout analyses. And finally,\nthe most import utility of the derivation of forcing functions is to understand the genesis of these forces and to determine if\nthey have or will change over time.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThere are a multitude of individuals and organizations that have made the Rollout Test and analysis activities a success. The\nSpace Shuttle Loads Panel has been the technical community within which all of these activities have been performed. The\nSpace Shuttle System Engineering and Integration Office continues to manage and fund these activities. The Space Shuttle\nProgram Managers have had the difficult task of balancing the technical recommendations and the larger program needs and\nhave allowed this work to proceed. The success of the testing and the quality of the data have been made possible by the\ndedication of the NASA Kennedy Spaceflight Center personnel who assisted, enabled, and led the test activities. NASA\nLangley Research Center, NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center, Sandia National Laboratories, Boeing, and NASA Johnson\nSpaceflight Center all have provided test equipment and personnel for the test. However, the most critical individual to the\nhistorical and future activities related to the understanding and control of the rollout environment is the Space Shuttle\nProgram\'s Jene Richart. He has been the critical link in all phases of NASA\'s response to the rollout issue.\n\nREFERENCES\n[l] K. Elliott. R.
