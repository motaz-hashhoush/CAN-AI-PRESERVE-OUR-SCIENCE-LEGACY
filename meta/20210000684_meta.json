However, substantial challenges exist that could delay (and possibly prevent) these developments and thus research is needed in a variety of areas to leverage technologies in autonomy, Air Traffic Management (ATM), multi-redundant flight systems architectures, and advanced wireless connectivity like 5G to meet these challenges. The goal of this ULI project is to develop new technologies and innovative operational concepts which will ensure safe, secure and robust integration of autonomous vehicles into Advanced Air Mobility-tailored transportation infrastructure.  All this must be done while maintaining inter-operability with current civil air transportation systems and associated safety standards. The project is organized into four Technical Challenges (TCs) areas designed to provide unique UAM solutions and a transition roadmap for industry and government to utilize research product output.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210000684, "publisher": "NASA", "id": "047ba40f13d643699a2eda18cb6825e8", "publicationName": "NASA TechPort", "publicationDate": "2021-01-26T08:00:00.0000000+00:00", "url": "https://techport.nasa.gov/view/96905"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "TechPort Data Sheet - NCAT - Download 01_20_2021 01 15 PM PST.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210000684/downloads/TechPort%20Data%20Sheet%20-%20NCAT%20-%20Download%2001_20_2021%2001%2015%20PM%20PST.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210000684/downloads/TechPort%20Data%20Sheet%20-%20NCAT%20-%20Download%2001_20_2021%2001%2015%20PM%20PST.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210000684/downloads/TechPort%20Data%20Sheet%20-%20NCAT%20-%20Download%2001_20_2021%2001%2015%20PM%20PST.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
