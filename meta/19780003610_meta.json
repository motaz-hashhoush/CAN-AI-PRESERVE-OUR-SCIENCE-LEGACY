The geometric description of the surface and the analytical description of the gravity field of the earth by means of worldwide reference systems, with the aid of satellite geodesy, are presented. A triangulation method based on photogrammetric principles is described in detail. Results are derived in the form of three dimensional models. These mathematical models represent the frame of reference into which one can fit the existing geodetic results from the various local datums, as well as future measurements.", "title": "National Geodetic Satellite Program, Part II: National Geodetic Society", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T13:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780003610, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Schmid, H."}, "organization": {"name": "National Geographic Society", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "id": "8911f035a10f470c86f88ed3fb140168"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2018-12-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19780003610, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780003610, "id": "f9e836301ce84cd7ae6bbfa5dcf676a0", "publicationName": "National Geodetic Satellite Program, Part II: A Report Compiled and Edited for NASA by the AGU", "publicationDate": "1977-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780003609, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "National Geodetic Satellite Program, Part II: A Report Compiled and Edited for NASA by the AGU ", "stiType": "SPECIAL_PUBLICATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19780003610.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19780003610/downloads/19780003610.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19780003610/downloads/19780003610.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19780003610/downloads/19780003610.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
