A series of increasingly challenging missions awaits, and this new\nspacecraft will take us farther than we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone before. It will be most advanced spacecraft ever built capable enough\nto take us to a variety of destinations including exploring a captured near earth asteroid. Under the Asteroid\nRedirect Mission (ARM) plan, a near earth asteroid would be redirected into a Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO)\naround the Earths Moon where an Orion capsule launched atop an SLS rocket will carry crew members and the\nequipment necessary to explore the asteroid, collect samples and return safely to Earth.\nPlanning a mission to explore the asteroid poses several challenges to mission designers including balancing\ncompeting constraints including cost, risk and spacecraft performance metrics like launch mass, mission duration\nand consumable limitations. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of a crewed asteroid mission many critical\nparameters including mission objectives, crew size, mission duration, crew consumables and spacecraft performance\nare examined to develop a feasible mission plan.\n\nII.\n\nARCM MISSION OVERVIEW\n\nA. Reference Mission Schedule\nCurrent NASA policy is to perform asteroid missions as soon as 2021 and before 2025. For planning purposes\nasteroid 2009BD was selected as a feasible target. The reference ARCM evaluated for this study targets Asteroid\nRedirect Vehicle (ARV) rendezvous with 2009BD and redirecting the asteroid to a DRO no earlier than November\n2024. However performance assessment showed than an Orion rendezvous and dock with the ARV is feasible in\nMay 2024 prior to full DRO insertion by allowing the ARV to coast along the \xe2\x80\x98spiral\xe2\x80\x99 during the short docked\noperations. Once the Orion has undocked, the ARV can continue to the final DRO.\n\nB. Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission Concept Overview\nAfter capturing the asteroid, the ARV spacecraft is used to redirect the trajectory of an asteroid, capture it into\nthe Earth-Moon system, and transfer it to a stable DRO with an orbit altitude of roughly 70,000km.\nThe crew will be transported to the DRO utilizing the Orion spacecraft launched atop a SLS rocket. The\nARCM design reference mission is designed around the translunar transit, rendezvous and docking with the ARV in\nthe DRO orbit and return to earth.\nAt the asteroid, crewmembers will perform two four-hour Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVA) to explore the\nasteroid and retrieve samples for Earth return. The ARCM design reference mission supports five days total time at\nthe DRO for joint operations, with a day between EVAs and protection for a contingency day. Upon completion of\n\nintegrated operations the Orion spacecraft returns to earth on a tar\ne\nrget line traject\ntory splashing down in the P\nPacific\nOcean off the coast of California. The total mission duration is be\n30 days depen\nC\ne\netween 24 and\nnding on the sp\npecific\nepoch selected.\n\nC. Orion ARCM Reference Co\nR\nonfiguration\nn\nansports up to four crew me\nThe Orion spacecraf is a pressuri\nO\nft\nized, crewed element that tra\ne\no\nembers to spac and\nce\nreturns the safely back to the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface at the end of a missi\nem\nion. The Orion provides all s\nn\nservices necess\nsary to\nsupport fou crewmembe for up to 21 days. Figure 1 depicts a r\nur\ners\n2\ne\nrepresentative Orion configu\nuration includin the\nng\nCrew Mod (CM), Serv Module (S\ndule\nvice\nSM), Spacecraf Adapter (SA and a Launch Abort System (LAS).\nft\nA)\nh\nm\n\nFigure 1: Orion Config\nF\nO\nguration\nFor th feasibility study, the Orion configuration is based on the Orion for the Exploratio Mission-2 (E\nhis\non\nEM-2)\nLunar Orb mission. Th Orion vehic configurati summary f the EM-2 mission is sho\nbit\nhe\ncle\nion\nfor\nown in Table 1 and\nincludes pr\nrovisions for four crewmemb for up to 21 days. For th study, the Orion referenc configuratio was\nf\nbers\nthis\nce\non\naugmented to add rendez\nd\nzvous and dock\nking, EVA, and sample return functionality required to acc\nd\nn\ncomplish the A\nARCM\nobjectives. To minimize the integrated Orion hardw\ne\nd\nware and softwa configurati changes, th additional A\nare\nion\nhe\nARCM\nfunctionali is provided as add-on miss\nity\nsion kits that will interface w the existing Orion system where practi\nw\nwith\ng\nms\nical.\n\nTable 1: Orion EM- Referenc Configura\n-2\nce\nation\n\nTable 2 contains a list of the ARCM kits required to support rendezvous and docking, EVA, and sample return\nobjectives. The EVA Suit Kit contains the elements necessary to convert the launch and entry suit into an EVAcompatible suit. The EVA Servicing Kit contains hardware to replenish and recharge suit consumables between\nEVAs and provide communications between the ground and crew during the EVAs. The EVA Repress Kit provides\ncabin air required to repress the Orion cabin following the two EVAs. The EVA kits are designed to leverage\nexisting development work or to utilize existing technology.\n\nTable 2: Orion ARCM Functionality Kits\nFunctionality\n\nKit\n\nEVA\n\nEVA Suit Kit\nEVA Servicing Kit\nEVA Repress Kit\n\nVehicle Mating\n\nRelative Navigation Kit\nDocking Kit\n\nThe vehicle mating kits consist of: Relative Navigation Kit which includes the sensors required for rendezvous\nand proximity operations and a Docking Kit which includes the International Docking System Standard (IDSS)\ncompliant mechanisms necessary to securely attach the two spacecraft. Although not included in the EM-2 mission,\nthe Orion spacecraft is designed to accommodate the IDSS compliant mechanism without design modifications.\nThe sensor data generated by the Relative Navigation Sensor kit during rendezvous and docking must be integrated\ninto the Orion Guidance and Navigation software. Because the reference EM-2 mission does not include docking\nactivities, the integration of the rendezvous sensors and guidance algorithms required for docking is not included in\nthe EM-2 baseline.\n\nIII.\n\nMISSION DESIGN TRADES\n\nA. Trajectory\nThe reference ARCM trajectories evaluated for this study targets an Orion launch to rendezvous and dock with\nthe ARV/asteroid in a retrograde orbit around the moon. The trajectory utilizes powered lunar gravity assist\nmaneuvers to assist the Orion spacecraft to and from the DRO. Several different trajectory approaches were\nexamined including minimizing total duration, minimizing the number of burns required to perform the mission and\nminimizing the Orion \xe2\x88\x86V required to complete the mission.\nThe reference trajectory was selected based on minimizing the Orion \xe2\x88\x86V required in order to maintain some\nmeasure of abort capability. The reference trajectory is shown in Figure 2. The outbound leg requires 7 days with\n1 day to rendezvous and dock with the ARV, 5 days of operations at the asteroid and 10 days to return to earth for a\ntotal mission duration of 23 days.\n\nFigu 2 ARCM Reference Trajectory\nure\nM\ne\ny\nB.

This section describes the\nsensors and components required to successfully rendezvous and dock.

The star trackers will be supporting long-range and mid-range\nbearing computation to a target vehicle, in addition to providing attitude updates to the Orion absolute navigation\nsoftware. The S-band will provide range and range-rate measurements from the Orion to the ARV from 100km until\nthe LOCI is the primary relative navigation sensor (approximately five to six kilometers).\nOrion\xe2\x80\x99s Relative Navigation Kit, pictured in Figure 3, is comprised of two (2) Vision Navigation Sensors\n(VNS) and two (2) docking cameras into a single unit called the Laser Optical Camera Instrument (LOCI). LOCI is\na single chassis, dual one-fault tolerant sensor suite. LOCI is mounted to the docking hatch, operating through the\ndocking hatch window. The crew installs and connects LOCI prior to performing any rendezvous and docking\nmaneuvers at least one day prior to rendezvous operations.\nA prototype system, called Sensor Test for Orion RelNav Risk Mitigation (STORRM), consisting of a VNS and\na docking camera, was tested on STS-134. The prototype system was demonstrated during docking, undocking and\nre-rendezvous operations.\n\nFigure 2: Orion Relative Nav\ne\nR\nvigation Sen\nnsor Operat\ntional Regim\nme\n\nFigur 3: LOCI mounted to Orion dock\nre\nm\nking hatch (\n(interior vie\new)\n\nsumable An\nnalysis\nF. Cons\nFor this feasibility st\ntudy, the SM is assumed to fl with the full consumables capacity of 89\ns\nly\nl\n9.4kg oxygen, 3\n35.8kg\nnitrogen, and 227.8kg water. Orion EM carries suf\na\nM-2\nfficient ECLSS consumables to support 4 c\nS\ns\ncrewmembers for 18\nnominal days and 3 co\nd\nontingency da\nays. Addition capacity in\nnal\nncludes suffic\ncient consuma\nables to suppl one\nly\ncontingenc event. For this analysis, many cases were studied t determine t worst case O2, N2, and water\ncy\nw\nto\nthe\ne\n\nstorage required on the SM and CM. Consistent with the EM-2 baseline, the Orion cannot support all of the\ncontingencies in the same mission, but it can accommodate any one of them. The list includes:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nAn MMOD strike or other leak, followed by \xe2\x80\x9cFeed-the-Leak\xe2\x80\x9d for suit donning, and an unpressurized\nreturn to Earth\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nA cabin depressurization and repressurization (after atmosphere contamination)\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nPartial cabin depressurization and repressurization (after a failed hatch leak check)\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nA contingency EVA using umbilicals, including depressurization and repressurization\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nEngine out case which increases mission duration\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nThese cases, and the associated analysis, apply to the ARCM concept of operations with one exception.\nThe duration of an unpressurized return to Earth or increased mission duration would change.\n\nConsumables are driven by crew needs or by Orion contingencies. Orion Mission Functionality kits are used to\nprovide oxygen during the EVA and to repressurize the vehicle. Therefore, consumables specifically related to\nARCM activities are not drivers of consumable requirements. Figure 4 illustrates the allocation of each consumable\nto the mission requirements.\n\nFigure 4 Consumables Required\nIII.F.1.1 Oxygen\nOxygen is consumed by the crew and lost as a result of leakage or venting of several systems. The rate of\nmetabolic consumption of oxygen varies depending on crew activity. The nominal 18-day Orion mission includes\n11 exercise days and 7 non-exercise days. Leakage rates are affected by vehicle pressure. Oxygen is lost by\nventing the ullage volume of the amine swingbed system that controls CO2 and humidity, and may be lost if urine\nventing is included. When EVAs are performed, the oxygen (and other gases) in the cabin is vented so that the\nhatch can be opened. The EVA Repress Kit, not by the Orion tanks, replaces cabin gases. The PLSS provides\noxygen for the EVA, some air will be lost to suit leakage. Orion oxygen will be used while the crew is on\numbilicals during EVA preparation; this operation includes an oxygen purge to de-nitrogenate the spacesuit prior to\ncabin depressurization.\nContingency analysis for this mission has not identified any unique failure cases for the ARCM mission beyond\nthose documented for Orion EM-2. However, due to the trajectories, if an unrecoverable depressurization occurs\n\nearly in the mission, in which the crew has to don their suits in an unpressurized cabin, the total duration of suited\ntime may be increased. The spacesuits have a considerably higher leak rate than the vehicle cabin, therefore the SM\ntanks must provide the additional oxygen needed.\nConsumable management of oxygen for the mission is feasible because the total additional oxygen required for\nthe extended duration, EVA operations, and additional contingency capacity is less than the quantity saved by the\ncrew size reduction. Figure 5 depicts Orion oxygen consumption.\n\nFigure 5: Orion SM Oxygen Usage\nIII.F.1.2 Nitrogen\nNitrogen is provided for leakage and system venting makeup, as well as for repressurization from 10.2psia to\n14.7psia before earth re-entry. Mission duration, system venting, and pressurization of a volume drive nitrogen use;\nit is not consumed metabolically. Nitrogen used to repressurize the cabin after EVA is provided by the Cabin\nRepress Kit, not the Orion SM tanks. Contingency nitrogen stores could be used to feed a leak while the crew dons\ntheir suits. Orion contingency stores sized for the \xe2\x80\x9cFeed the Leak\xe2\x80\x9d case must be preserved for this mission. The\nARCM Concept of Operations does not change the nitrogen related contingency stores, and nitrogen use is not\ndriven by crew size. The increase in the duration of the mission will increase nitrogen usage somewhat, but only by\na very small amount. Figure 6 illustrates nitrogen consumption during the ARCM mission.\n\nFigure 6: Orion SM Nitrogen Usage\nIII.F.1.3 Water\nOrion water use includes single-use and daily-use volumes. Single-use volumes include eyewash contingencies\nand mission events, such as rehydration prior to landing. Daily nominal use rates include drinking water and food\nrehydration water. The crew requires additional drinking water on EVA days, an addition to the ARCM mission\nscope as compared to Orion EM-2. The reduction in crew size from four to two substantially compensates for the\nadditional water required for EVA hydration and the small increase in mission duration. Figure 7 shows water\nconsumption throughout the mission.\n\nOrion SM Water\n\nSM Consumables (kg)\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nMission Day\n\nFigure 7: Orion SM Water Usage\nG. Integrated Orion ARCM Mass\nThe ARCM mission kit masses were derived from a bottoms-up estimation of the required hardware. With the\nexception of the Relative Navigation Kit, all hardware masses were based on existing hardware elements and\nrepresent an accurate estimate of the additional mass required. The Relative Navigation Kit mass is derived from\nprevious engineering estimates and represents the current best estimate. The EVA hardware kit mass of 283kg\n\nincludes the EVA Suit kit, PLSS, EVA Tools and EVA Communications mass estimates. The mounting hardware\nmass estimate is a parametrically derived mass to account for adapter plates required to stow the kit hardware in\nOrion.\nDespite offloading crew and equipment, the ARCM mission required mass exceeds the Orion Gross Lift-Off\nMass by 519 kg. However the integrated trajectory analysis shows sufficient Orion Service Module \xe2\x88\x86V\nperformance exists to execute the mission including performing part of the Trans Lunar Injection (TLI) burn.\n\nARUM Mission MPCV Off\nKit Mass\nLoaded Mass\n\nTable 4: Orion ARCM Mass Delta\nOrion Launch Mass for ARUM\nCrew\nCrew Seat\nGFE Crew Systems\nSuits\nSM Water*\nSM Oxygen*\nSM Nitrogen**\nCabin Repress Kit (26.5% O2)\nEVA Suit and Tools Kit\nSample Return Container\nDocking Mechanism Kit\nLAS Separation Hardware\nRelative Navigation Kit\nARUM Mission Crew Module Mass Delta\n\nlb\n-360.0\n-130.1\n-102.0\n-142.3\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n189.5\n624.8\n22.0\n751.8\n193.3\n97.0\n1144.1\n\nkg\n-163.3\n-59.0\n-46.2\n-64.6\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n85.9\n283.4\n10.0\n341.0\n87.7\n44.0\n519.0\n\nIn addition to the Orion launch control mass, the feasibility analysis must also address the nominal and abort\nlanded mass for Orion which is the load of the vehicle mass on the parachutes during landing. Table 5 shows the\nmass for nominal and abort landed mass.\nThe Service Module and docking mechanism are jettisoned prior to Earth entry and are therefore not included in\nthe landed mass estimates. For the nominal landing, crew consumables and EVA repress air have been expended\nfurther reducing the landed mass. Following a successful mission, some of the EVA tools from the Orion EVA Tool\nKit will likely remain in the ARV toolbox to support possible extensibility missions and up to 20kg of asteroid\nsamples will return in the sample container. The nominal landed mass is higher than the EM-2 baseline\nconfiguration by 39.9kg and requires additional detailed analysis to identify mitigation options.\nDuring an abort landing, this study assumes that the crew will not have had an opportunity to use any of the\nmission consumables and the landed mass in an abort scenario exceeds the EM-2 baseline value by even more than\nthe nominal landed mass. Both the abort and nominal landed mass challenges must be resolved in the context of the\ngreater Orion mass challenge where mitigations include accepting additional risk, increasing program dispersion\nparameters or reduced mission functionality. Further analysis is required.\n\nTable 5: Orion Nominal and Abort Landed Mass Delta\nOrion Nominal\nOrion Abort Landed\nLanded Mass\nMass\nlb\nkg\nlb\nkg\n-360.0\n-163.0\n-360.0\n-163.3\n\nMPCV Off\nARUM Mission Loaded\nKit Mass\nMass\n\nCrew\nCrew Seat\n\n-130.1\n\n-59.0\n\n-130.1\n\n-59.0\n\nGFE Crew Systems\n\n-102.0\n\n-46.2\n\n-102.0\n\n-46.2\n\nSuits\nCabin Repress Kit (26.5% O2)\nEVA Suit and Tools Kit\nDocking Mechanism Kit\nSample Return\nLAS Separation Hardware\nRelative Navigation\nLanded Mass Delta\n\n-142.3\n119.7\n560.9\n0.0\n44.1\n0.0\n97.0\n87.9\n\n-64.6\n54.3\n254.4\n0.0\n20.0\n0.0\n44.0\n39.9\n\n-142.3\n189.5\n624.8\n0.0\n22.0\n0.0\n97.0\n199.0\n\n-64.6\n85.9\n283.4\n0.0\n10.0\n0.0\n44.0\n90.3\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMission kits are utilized to augment Orion with the necessary functionality without introducing costly new\nrequirements to the mature Orion spacecraft design effort. Understanding how the mission kits are incorporated\nwhile minimizing cost, schedule and mass impacts will be is important on any spaceflight. The Asteroid Redirect\nCrewed Mission provides an exciting early mission for the Orion and SLS while providing a stepping-stone to even\nmore ambitious missions in the future by leveraging the ARCM kit investments to provide the added functionality\nthat will be beneficial to future exploration missions.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Asteroid Redirect Mission teams from JPL, LaRC, JSC,\nand KSC for their inputs.\n\n'
