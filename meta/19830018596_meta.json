This survey paper will review some of the more recent work on the effect of space environment on (1) thin films, (2) structural composites, and (3) thermal control materials. Degradation in thermal-mechanical and optical properties associated with atmospheric and trapped particles and ultraviolet light will be highlighted. Finally, the dimensional instability associated with microcracking during thermal cycling will be examined and a methodology for estimating thermal fatigue effects from results of mechanical fatigue tests will be presented.", "title": "Spacecraft material applications:  Long-term stability questions", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T14:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830018596, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Crossman, F.
