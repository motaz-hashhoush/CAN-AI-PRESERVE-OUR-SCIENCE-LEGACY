Frequently\nrivets must be set in places made tight by the proximity of structural members or by other factors.\n\nThe solution:\nA new and very simple tool suffices for all such\nriveting, whereas formerly a special tool had to be\nfabricated for each different type of setting.\n\nHow it\'s done:\nA typical tool consists of a 4-inch length of rubber\nhose, of 5/8-inch inner diameter, encased in a similar length of braided metal hose. An anvil for the\nriveting gun is set in one end of the rubber hose\nwhich is loaded with five steel bearing balls of 5/8inch diameter; in the other end a rivet-set is mounted.\nWhen this tool is flexed to any degree between the\nhead of a riveting gun (or any impact tool) and a rivet,\nthe loss of impact is negligible. The tool may be made\nin any of many diameters and lengths, and its principle and use are not restricted to riveting. The ball-toball line of contact might be improved by insertion\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
