b'HEALTH AND MEDICINE\nCOMMERCIAL BENEFITS\xe2\x80\x94SPINOFF\n\nRobotic Surgery\n\nO\n\nperating rooms are stepping into the 21st\ncentury thanks to a robotic arm that can\nassist surgeons in non-invasive, endoscopic procedures. Computer Motion, Inc., in\nSanta Barbara, California, originally performed\nresearch under a NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract from the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory to develop AESOP,\xc2\xae\n(Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal\nPositioning).\nNASA hopes to make use of the technology\npowering the robotic arm of AESOP to service\nsatellites and inspect payloads on the Space Shuttle in\nthe future. The hope is to use robotics on space repair\nmissions requiring exact and precise movements that\nexceed human dexterity.\n\nNearly a million endoscopic surgeries are performed annually by inserting a slender camera into a\nsmall incision in the patient to access the part of the\nbody targeted for the operation. The surgeon uses the\ncamera to monitor the operation, which requires long,\nnarrow instruments. This endoscopic approach\nreduces the healing and recovery time needed by the\npatient and lowers healthcare costs.\nNow, with Computer Motion\xe2\x80\x99s AESOP, surgeons\ncan control the motion of the camera, which is\nattached to a robotic arm. AESOP eliminates the need\nfor surgical staff to hold the camera in place. The\nrobotic arm also allows for a steadier view of the\nsurgery and more precise and consistent movements\nof the camera.\nThe AESOP arm uses Computer Motion\xe2\x80\x99s voice\nrecognition software, which is pre-recorded onto a\n\nDoctors seated in the\nZEUS\xe2\x84\xa2 Robotic Surgical\nSystem can perform\nminimally invasive\nsurgeries without suffering\nfrom fatigue or stress\nduring lengthy operations.\n36\n\nNASA SPINOFF 2000\n\nvoice card and inserted into the controller.\nComputer Motion\xe2\x80\x99s NASA-funded\nresearch determined that voice controlled\ncommands are preferred in the operating\nroom as opposed to alternatives such as\neye-tracking and head-tracking, which\ncontrol motion in response to movements\nof the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s head.\nA second generation of this technology,\ncalled the ZEUS\xe2\x84\xa2 Robotic Surgical\nSystem, has the potential to make endoscopic procedures even more accessible.\nTraditional endoscopic methods require a\nlong learning curve and a greater dexterity\nthan some possess. Also, suturing for\nmicrosurgical procedures such as endoscopic coronary artery bypass graft often\nexceeds typical human dexterity limits.\nHowever, through the use of a masterslave robotic system, surgeon motions are\nscaled down, allowing the doctor to make\nmore natural movements. By manipulating additional robotic arms, the surgeon\ncan move the instruments with the\nprecision the procedure requires. Incisions\ncan be made smaller than the diameter of\na pencil as compared to the 12- to 15-inch\nincision and cracked ribs traditional openheart surgery requires.\nOne final benefit of the ZEUS system is that it\nallows the surgeon to perform the operation seated in\nan ergonomic position, eliminating the problems of\nfatigue and frustration resulting from leaning over the\npatient in an awkward posture for hours.\nLast summer, the first completely endoscopic\ncoronary artery bypass graft was performed using the\nZEUS system and has now been put in use at 19 sites.\nComputer Motion hopes to use AESOP and ZEUS as\nthe cornerstone technologies for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Intelligent Operating Room.\xe2\x84\xa2\n\nCOMPUTER THEALTH AND MEDICINE\nCOMMERCIAL BENEFITS\xe2\x80\x94SPINOFF\n\nAESOP,\xc2\xae a voice-controlled robotic endoscopic\npositioning system, provides an absolutely steady picture\nduring minimally invasive surgeries.\n\nAESOP\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of Computer Motion, Inc.\nZEUSTM and Intelligent Operating RoomTM are trademarks of Computer Motion, Inc.\n\nNASA SPINOFF 2000\n\n37\n\n'
