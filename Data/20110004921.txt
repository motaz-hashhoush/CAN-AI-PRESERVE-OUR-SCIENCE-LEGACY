After each flight, each one\nof the 24,000 tiles must be inspected. Engineers from NASA\'s Ames\nResearch Center in Moffett Field,\nA, and the Boeing Co. in Huntington Beach, CA, have developed\na handheld laser scanner for inspecting the tiles.\nThe scanner uses a digital camera and lasers in a measurement\ntechnique called laser triangulation. It is the first step toward\ndeveloping an Electronic Inspection and Mapping System (ElMS)\nthat could aid evaluation of the\nshuttle\'s Thermal Protection System (TPS). The 5 x 9" box, when\nplaced over a tile, measures flaws\nwithin a 3 x 3" area. The scanner\nF sends the data to a laptop computer. Software locates and characterizes the damage and generates a\n\nand sore of the flaw. Thc system\nalso contains a database of tile fabrication and maintenance information for each tile on the orbiter\nbeing measured.\nThe system could make the\ninspection process more efficient,\naccording to Suzy Cunningham,\nTPS project manager at Kennedy\nSpace Center. That, in turn, would\nreduce vehicle turn-around time.\nThe technology also may have\napplications in other fields, including integrated circuit inspection\nand in manufacturing processes\nthat require high accuracy.\nFor more information, contact Ann\nHutchison of NASA Ames at 650604-3039, or visit hllp://amesnews.\narc. nasa.gov/releases/2001/01_J6AR.\nhtml.\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 200 1\n\nthkinn\n\nTotal mobility means the freedom to create,\n\xe2\x80\x94anytime, anywhere.\nchange and communicate\nPocketCAD PRO, powered with Autodesk\'\ntechnology; is the only fully functional CAD\nsoftware for Windows\'-powered Pocket PC\'s\nand mobile devices.

In fact, virtual reality\nand simulation technology are both key\ncomponents in a number of different\nareas, chief among them being manufacturing and design.\nTo understand what\'s being done with\nVR and simulation technology, one must\nunderstand that the differences between\nthem are largely just a matter of interface. Both simulation and VR are tools\nthat can he used for analyzing and testing materials, training people in numerous wa ys, and the design and implementation of new ideas and concepts.\nThe main distinction between the two\nis how the users operate the technology.\nVR often requires much more physical\ninteraction on the user\'s part, while simulation typically is more passive.\nVirtual reality is thought of as a very\ntactile process, incorporating gloves,\njoysticks, head-mounted displays, 3D\n16\t\n\nste) en glasses. aII(l ea1proje(tlo11 ideo\nscreens and walls. Simulation involves visualization software with high-end\ngraphics - often using 3D CAD models\n- operating on high-speed workstations. The two are used together by designers and engineers to create almost\nany type of artificial world imaginable.\nIn these digital environments, most\ntypes of real-world situations, variables,\nand reactions can be duplicated.\nFor instance, an aerospace engineer\ncould replicate a plane in flight and subject it to a myriad of stresses, including\nwind shears, thunderstorms, and equipment failure. By using this simulation,\nthe engineer can see the results of tests\nand variables without using physical materials and possibly risking damage to\nperson antI property. In a more NR-oriented environment, the same engineer\ncould design a program that allows a\npilot to don a pair of 3D stereo glasses\nand use a joystick to "fl y" that simulated\nplane. Then, when the plane is subjected\nto stresses, the pilot can react to them.\nThis would provide data for both the\npilot and the engineer to improve the\ndesign of the plane and its components.\nwwwnasatech.com\t\n\nI lie ultiniate ailsant,ii.e of these technologies is truly collaborative design, engineering, and analysis - enabling\ngroups of engineers to view and manipulate, in real time, a virtual object as easily as they could a ph ysical object.\n\nPioneers in Reality\nFakespace Labs, a Mountain View, GAbased virtual reality company, began as a\nNASA spinoff originally contracted in\nthe early 1990s by NASA\'s Ames Research Center (Moffett Field, CA) to develop a teleoperated motion platform\nfor transmitting sounds and images\nfrom remote locations.

While engineers ma y have to\nlearn how to operate the simulation\ntechnology itself, the y still have other familiar design tools at their disposal.\n\nTools of the Trade\nAccording to SGI\'s Govers, having the\nright equipment is the first and most important step in running a VR system. "In\norder to do large-scale 3D graphics," he\nsaid, "first of all, you have to have a fast\ncomputer. Second of all, you have to\nhave the ability to bring data in and out\nof that computer very quickly and at very\nhigh bandwidth."\nOther high-end computer suppliers,\nin addition to SGI, are working to make\nsuper-fast workstations more accessible.\nHewlett-Packard offers the HP Visualize\nCenter, a fulls\' immersive visualization\nsystem powered by three synchronized\nHP j6000 workstations with VisualizefxlOpro graphics. The machines work in\ntandem with large-scale 3D stereographic display systems and OpenGL\nsoftware to bring products to life in a\nseamless, wide-field display.\nThe HP Visualize workgroup solution\nis a smaller, desktop version built around\na single dual-processor HP j5600 workstation. The workgroup drives seamless\ndisplays that can be deployed right into\nthe engineering workspace or on the engineer\'s desk.\nConnecting the user to the equipment is just as important as having the\nright equipment. One of the constant\nthemes in VR and simulation technology\nis ease of use. As markets and uses for\nthe technology continue to broaden, the\npeople who are using it aren\'t necessarily trained to understand simulation\ncoding and physics. Williams stressed\nthe fact that the human part of the equation is becoming more and more vital as\nthe field advances.\n"It is one thing to provide a tool that\ncan do all these sorts of simulations,"\nsaid Williams. "It is another thing to provide a tool that makes it easy to do this.\nWe\'ve also spent a lot of time focused on\nmaking the set-up and just building on\nthese models, utilizing these models,\nand also looking at results and how they\nbehave."\nBy focusing on how everything works,\nWilliams explained that it makes it easier\nto understand how to make the systems\nmore intuitive. For a company like\nALGOR, which focuses on finite element analysis and mechanical event simulation, the goal is making sure users\ncan understand what stresses they are\napplying to their models.\nFor a company like SGI, which offers a\nbroader range of simulations, the need\nfor ease of use is much more about how\nNASA Tech Briefs,June 2001\n\n4\n\n14\n\n-4\nI\n\nre you Sure\nrou have A\n\nL\n\nGood Design.?\nWill it overheat?

But still the industry\ncontinues to improve the techniques\nand the equipment, making life easier and analysis times shorter - for the\nresearcher in the laboratory. And as\nmore powerful and more compact lasers\nare developed for the needed excitation\nwavelengths, mature techniques such as\nRaman spectroscopy gain new adherents.\nAccording to Thermo Nicolet Instruments of Madison, WI, the spur that\nmade Raman spectroscopy a routine\nanalytical method was the development\nof Fourier transform detection techniques. Fourier transform IR (FT-IR)\ninstruments measure the interaction of\ninfrared radiation with samples. Both\nthe absorption frequencies and the\nabsorption intensity of the radiation are\nrecorded. The frequency data is used to\ndetermine the sample\'s identity, and the\nintensity information the concentration\nof the material or materials of interest.\nIn FT-IR Raman spectroscopy the 2D\nspectral plot shows Raman shift emission\nalong the x-axis rather than intensit y, as\nin competing methods. When near-IR\nlight strikes it, the sample scatters\nRaman radiation, at slightly longer\n(Stokes lines) or slightly shorter (antiStokes lines) wavelengths than that of\nthe laser that causes the excitation. After\nthe scattered light is detected, the computer, using the Fourier transform\nprocess, converts the data into a spectrum. Among the experiments and analytical methods now using FT-Raman are\nmonitoring real-time polymerization\nreactions at controlled temperatures\nand using fiber optic probes to identify\nnuclear waste materials remotely.\n\n4\n\nHa\t\n\nJobin Yvon Raman Multiwell Anal!Jzer\n\nThermo Nicolet points to research\nand development of new products, quality control of manufactured goods and\nincoming materials, forensic analysis,\nenvironmental testing, and other applications where FT-IR analysis proves valuable.

Other capabilities are dualchannel collection for PM-IRRAS,\nadvanced scanning velocities for rapid\nscan and slow scan, and extended spectral range (from 25,000 to 20 cm), and\nhyphenated techniques such as advanced infrared microscopy and FlRaman spectroscopy.\nAmong FT-Raman systems, Thermo\nNicolet offers the FT-Raman 960, which\nthe company says was designed for corporate or academic researchers who\nwant the optimum in FT-Raman performance. It uses gold-coated reflective\noptics throughout its high-throughput\noptical design. The 960 offers the ability\nto search unknown spectra against several commercial libraries. It allows data\ncollection with no sample preparation,\nand collection from aqueous solutions\nwithout strong interference from the\nwater content. It also allows nondestructive sampling through thin plastic bags,\nblister packs, or glass bottles without the\nneed to remove or have contact with the\nsamples inside.\nFrom another leading supplier of\nspectroscopic systems, Kaiser Optical\nSystems, of Ann Arbor, MI, a Rockwell\nCollins company, comes a wide range of\ninstruments providing Raman or other\nkinds of spectroscopic techniques.\nProminent among these is the HoloLab\nSeries 5000 modular Raman spectrometer. Kaiser says that its modular architecture provides experimental versatility\nand stability, yet allows for future expansion or upgrading. At its heart is Kaiser\'s\naxial transmissive imaging spectrograph\ndesign, which combines fast f/1.8 optics\nwith HoloPlexTM transmission grating\ntechnology. This grating, and the instrument\'s multichannel CCD array detector, yields spectral coverage from 100 to\n4400 cm\' with 532-nm excitation without aperture sharing or scanning. Kaiser\nOptical says this means reduced data\nacquisition times per sample.\nThe Series 5000 spectrometer can be\noutfitted with the Mark II holographic\nfiltered prohehead (HFPI-I), which\nKaiser says will supply high signal-tobackground measurements. This probehead uses a single fiber for excitation\nand another for collection. Standard\ntelecommunications fiber diameters\n\n2a\t\n\n(less than 100 microns) result in\nincreased mechanical stability.\nKaiser says that, for process equip- ment, single fibers reduce the cost of\nlong runs of multiple collection fibers,\nand also permit multichannel operation\non a single spectrograph. Noncontact\noptics with working distances of 0.1 in.\nto 17 in. can measure through windows\nor bottles, or simply at a safe distance\nfrom a sample. Immersion and insertion optics use single, double, or triple\nwindow designs to allow safe, direct\ninstallation into reaction vessels or\nprocess streams.\n\nInstant Collection\nThe HoloLab Series 5000 Raman integrated system is also based on Kaiser\'s\naxial transmissive imaging spectrograph\ndesign, featuring f/1.8 optics and\nHoloPlex transmission grating technology. The company says that the entire\nRaman spectrum is collected instantaneously at high resolution by optically\nfolding the scattered Raman photons\nonto a large-format multichannel CCD\ndetector. Options include a Raman\nmicroscope, a remote filtered probehead, and a Class 1 sampling compartment, as well as three excitation wavelengths (532, 633, or 785 nm). Alternative gratings, cameras, and laser\nsources are available. Kaiser says\nWindows\xc2\xae-based H010GRAMSTM data\nacquisition and GRAMS/32/0C spectral\nanalysis software makes Raman data easily acquired and quickly analyzed.\nAlso incorporating the HoloPlex grating technology is Kaiser\'s line of\nRamanRxn2 analyzers, which, like the\nHoloLab Series 5000, collect the entire\nRaman spectrum instantaneously at\nhigh resolution. This enables the collection of wavelengths of chemically changing samples such as polymerizations,\ncuring, and bubbling solutions or\nspecies with widely separated analytical\nbands of interest. Kaiser says more accurate quantitative analysis results, and\nthat the modular instrument design and\nfiber optic coupling provide robust performance and analyzer stability.\nKaiser\'s entries in the telecommunications arena are the UltraSpec-C 160 and\nUltraSpec-L160 for DWDM network\nmonitoring applications. The C-160 has\nthe range and resolution necessary for\ncharacterization of the telecommunications C-band spectrum at 50-GHz channel spacing, while the L-160 extends that\nto the L-band spectrum. Expanding on\nholographic optics deployed in Raman\nspectrographs and military avionics, the\n\nsww.nasatech.com\t\n\npatent-pending UltraSpec grating/prism\nstructure uses a Volume Phase Holographic (VPHTM) transmission grating\nrecorded in dichromated gelatin and\nsealed between two precision prisms.\nKaiser says the expanded beam footprint\non the grating, much larger than the\nbeam cross-section, results in a combination of high dispersion and high resolution in a very compact package.\n\nHigh-Throughput Screening\nAccording to sources at Jobin Yvon,\nthe spectroscopy arm of the Horiba\ngroup, based in Edison, NJ, the latest\napproach in analytical technology is\nhigh-throughput screening. This technique has become important in the\npharmaceutical industry and in life-science laboratories, where it is used in\nscreening of drug design and analysis of\nbatch production. JY Horiba says the\nnew Raman Multiwell Analyzer was\nspecifically constructed for use in the\nmanufacturing environment. Highthroughput applications mean the sample reaction process is undertaken in\nmultiwell plates, and this instrument,\nbased onjY Horiba\'s analytical LabRAM\nsystem, has been adapted for use as a\nfully automated multiwell analyzer. The\ncompany says its new optical designs\nmean a single multiwell plate - the standard is 12 x 8 - can he analyzed in a matter of seconds. Additional features\ninclude a dedicated long-travel autofocus system to compensate for different\nwell filling heights; two selectable gratings inside the spectrometer, allowing\neither high-resolution mode or quick\nanalysis with full spectral coverage; and\nfull integration of different lasers.\n\nGet connected with the\ncompanies mentioned\nIn this article:\nThermo Nicolet Instruments\nCorp.\n(608) 275-6100\nwww.nicnlet.com\nKaiser Optical Sciences Inc.\n(734) 665-8083\nwww.hosl.com\nJobln Yvon Inc./Horlba\n(732) 494-8650\nwww.jljhorlba.com\n\nPhotonics Tech Briefs,June 2001\n\nAlien yourself\nwith telecom\'s\nmost accurate\n\nimagine\n\nFEATURES INCLUDE:\n\nIndium Gallium Arsenide.

In\nother words, the function of a light coupler on a QWIP is to redirect normally\nincident light to oblique incidence.\nHeretofore, the only wavelength-independent light couplers for QWIPs have\nbeen corrugated ones - parallel ridges\nand valle y s. A corrugated light coupler\ncan redirect normally incident light in a\ndirection with vector component perpendicular, but not parallel, to the ridge\nlines. On the other hand, a pyramidal\nlight coupler could redirect normally\nincident light along directions with vector along both mutually perpendicular\naxes in a plane parallel to the quantumwell surfaces; as a result, light should he\ncoupled more efficiently by a pyramidal\nthan by a corrugated coupler.\nCorrugated light couplers are fabricated by wet chemical etching that is selective\nwith respect to crystallographic planes.\nConsequently, a corrugated light coupler\ncan be oriented only parallel to one crystallographic plane; it is not possible to fabricate two crossed, superimposed corrugated light couplers by wet chemical etching to obtain a pyramidal light coupler.\nThe proposed p y ramidal light couplers would he fabricated by polv(methv\n\nWavelength-independent light couplers in the form of planar arrays of pyramids have been proposed for use on\nmultiple-quantum-well infrared photodetectors.

This leads to the concept of slots.\nThe positions and dimensions of the\nslots would be chosen to correspond to\nthe low-absorption regions.\nWhile the incorporation of slots\nwould exert little or no effect on pluitocurrent, it would significantly affect\nnoise. The dark current of a QWIP is\nproportional to its effective area. In the\npresence of slots, the effective area\nwould be the cross-sectional area of the\ncolumns between the slots. In a typical\ncase, this remaining area would be only\none-fourth the original area; consequently, the dark current of the slotted\nQWIP would be only one-fourth the\ndark current of the unslotted QWIP.\nInasmuch as the noise current of a\nQWIP is proportional to the square root\nof its dark current, the noise current of\nthe slotted QWIP would be reduced to\nhalf that of the unslotted QWIP, resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio twice that of\nthe unslotted QWIP at any wavelength\nand temperature.\nAnother anticipated benefit of slotting would he an increase in the fraction\nof incident light converted to polarization perpendicular to the planes bounding the quantum wells and thus an\nincrease in light-coupling efficienc y.

The result is that the signal power is spread over a\nspot much wider than the diffraction-limited spot in the focalplane, and the portion of signal power received at a given\npoint in this wider spot tends to fluctuate on a time scale of\nabout 10 to 100 ms. Hence, in order to capture most of the\nreceived signal power, it would be necessary to use a correspondingly larger-diameter detector, which, because of its\ngreater field-of-view, would also capture more of the undesired\nbackground radiation.\nIn a system according to the proposal, a single large detector\nwould he replaced by an array of smaller detectors, the photoncounting outputs of which would be fed to a digital signal\nprocessor (see figure). In the processor, the temporally varying\nphoton counts from the detectors would be effectively weighted\nand combined by algorithms that assign greater weights to\ndetectors receiving greater signal powers; thus, the contribution\nof undesired background radiation from detectors receiving less\nsignal power would be reduced, the net effect being that the\noverall signal-to-noise ratio of the received signal is increased.\nThe detection algorithms have been formulated specifically\nfor a communication system that uses M-ary pulse-position\nmodulation in which the receiver attempts to determine which\nof M possible symbols has been received by observing the photon counts accumulated during each of the M time slots of a\nsymbol period. It is assumed that the receiver is synchronized\nand, hence, "knows" the beginning and ending times of each\nsymbol period as well as the time of arrival of each detected\nphoton, and that these times and the associated photon counts\ncan be stored for the limited amount of time needed for pro- cessing. It is also assumed that the photon-count outputs of the\ndetectors are Poisson-distributed in time.\nOne of the algorithms utilizes continuous weighting of the\ncounts from the individual detectors to implement an optimism array-detector receiver. However, this algorithm is not\npractical because the computational burden quickly becomes\nexcessive as the number of detectors increases.\nIn the alternative simplified algorithm, continuous weighting is replaced by hard decisions on the selection of detectors\nfrom which the counts are to be considered at a given instant.\nThis algorithm would implement a computationally simpler,\nsuboptimum array-detector receiver. Computational simulations for representative cases have shown that the performance\nof the simpler suhoptiinum algorithm is almost equal to that of\nthe more complex optimum algorithm, and that the improvement in performance over a single detector of diffraction-limited size would be equivalent to an increase in signal strength\nof about 5 dB under realistic operating conditions.\n\nFT-1\n\nThis work was done by Victor Vim rotter and Meera Snnivasan of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Moreover, because no gear\ntrains are included, the number of moving parts is reduced and thus reliability\nis increased, relative to assemblies of\nprior design.

If one simply passes\nthe lamp light through a polarizer on the\nway to the LCD panel, then one wastes\nthe half of the light that is in the undesired polarization. To increase the efficiency of illumination, one would have to\nrecycle the otherwise wasted light, converting the undesired polarization to the\ndesired one; this is what is meant by\npolarization recycling."\nUnlike a related older polarizationrecycling technique, the two proposed\npolarization-recycling techniques would\nnot enlarge the cross section of the illuminating beam. (Such enlargement is a disadvantage in a typical application in which\none seeks to illuminate a small panel.)\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nFigure 1 schematically depicts the optical configuration for the first proposed\ntechnique. The unpolarized light from a\nlamp would be concentrated by a reflector and directed to a polarizing beam\nsplitter. The p-polarized light would pass\nthrough the beam splitter, while the spolarized light would be reflected perpendicularly toward an LCD panel. The\np-polarized light would strike a flat mirror, then would travel back to the lamp\nreflector, where it would he reflected\ntwice. After emerging from the lamp\nreflector, the p-polarized light would\npass through a half-wave retarder that\nwould occupy half of the beam cross section. The half-wave retarder would cause\nthe reflected p-polarized light to become\ns-polarized. In the beam splitter, this\nnewly s-polarized light would be reflected perpendicularly toward the LCD\npanel, along with the originally s-polarized light.\nFor the portion of unpolarized lamp\nlight that would hit the half-wave\nPhotonics Tech Bricfs.Jiine 2001\n\nHall-Wave Retarder\nPolarizing Beam Spitler \t\n\nMm-or\n\nReflector\n\nLamp\t\np_\n\nTo LCD Panel\n\np\t\n\nC\n\nPolarization in Page (p Polarization)\n0 Polarization Perpendicular to Page is Polarization)\n\nFigure 1. This Optical Configuration for Polarization Recycling would be suitable for illuminating a\nsmall panel facing perpendicularly to the optical axis of a lamp reflector.\n\nretarder first, the end result would be\nthe same, though the sequence of events\nwould differ: After passing through the\nhalf-wave retarder, the initially unpolarized light would remain unpolarized\nuntil it reached the polarizing beam\nsplitter. The p-polarized subpart of this\npart of the light would pass through the\nbeam splitter, while the s-polarized subpart would be reflected perpendicularly\ntoward the LCD panel. The p-polarized\nlight would strike the flat mirror and\nwould go back through the half-wave\nretarder, which would convert it to spolarized light. Continuing along its\npath, this portion of s-polarized light\nwould be reflected twice by the lamp\nreflector, and would finally be reflected\nperpendicularly, by the beam splitter,\ntoward the LCD panel.\nFigure 2 schematicall y depicts the configuration for the second proposed technique. Light from a lamp would reach a\nreflective polarizer; the p-polarized light\nwould pass through to the LCD panel,\nwhile the s-polarized light would be\nreflected. The reflected s-polarized light\n\nwould pass through a quarter-wave\nretarder, becoming circularly polarized.\nThe circularly polarized light would he\nreflected by a flat mirror and would go\nback through the quarter-wave retarder.\nwhich would cause this light to become\np-polarized, as needed to join the originally p-polarized light in illuminating\nthe LCD panel.\nThis work was done by In hang of Calf er/i\nfor NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor further information, access the Technical\nSupport Package (TSP) free on-line at\nwww.nasatech.com under the Physical\nSciences category.\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517, the\ncontractor has elected to retain title to thu\ninvention.

Th\nproject is focused on\nfinding new applicatiii\nmaterials, as well as finding methods\nfor applying those materials, specifically in aircraft.\nNASA Tech Briefs: What is the mission\nof the Morphing Project?\n\n!15\n\nNv.\nM,\nKpDA is micro-processor based and software\ncontrolled to solve\nalmost any position\nmeasurement problem.\nEasy push-button calibration, interchangeable sensors, and the\nability to save and\nrecall specific sensortarget calibration configurations make KpDA\nideal for the lab environment. Inductive\ntechnology is noncontact and immune to\ndust, fluids and color.\nFor More Information\r\nCircle No. 411\n\nAnna McGowan: The Morphing Project division is looking 20 years or further into the future and asking what\nairplanes are going to look like in 20\nyears, and what technologies we need\nto be researching today to make that\npossible. If we want airplanes that are\nextremely lightweight, maybe we need\nstructures and materials that are more\nlike bones, or very lightweight, porous\nmaterials that are still very strong. We\nwant wings that can handle rocks flying\nat them, or other damage. Can we\nmake things that self-heal - something that you can shoot a bullet\nthrough and it heals? We are not focusing on a specific vehicle, but rather\ndifferent technologies that would be\napplicable to a variety of different\nstructures.\n\nNTB: Could you explain what makes\nthe materials you work with "smart"?\nMcGowan: Smart materials actually\nrespond to a stimulus and you can control that response to your benefit. So,\nas an example, if y ou need to control\nvibration, you can take one of these\nmaterials that vibrates, you can control\nit to vibrate in the opposite direction\nyour wing is vibrating, and you therefore control wing vibration. That\'s why\nthey\'re called smart materials. They respond in a reproducible manner. For\nexample, when you apply five volts, it\nmoves six inches. Some of these materials are vibrational, which means they\nwork better at higher frequencies. Others are more static - they move slowly\nbut are very strong and can bend huge\nstructures very easily. For the materials\nwww.nasat(-ch .C( )T1\n\nthat move, you can compare those to\nnon-smart materials like steel or wood.\nIf you apply heat to steel or wood, they\ndon\'t move. They don\'t do anything except maybe melt or burn.\nThe idea is that basically, today, to\nmake things move, we need gears, hydraulics, pumps, cables, etc. Here, you\nwould not need that. All y ou would\nneed is the smart materials and stimuli\nlike heat, electricity, or magnetism.\nNTB:How many different types of\nsmart materials are you working with?\nMcGowan: There are actually far too\nmany to name because there are so\nmany different variations. Nickel titanium is a very common shape-memory\nalloy, but you can add different elements to change different aspects of\neach alloy. We\'ve mixed and created a\nlot of different materials, although we\ntend to stay with the ones we know\nwork very well. Langley is, for all of\nNASA, the Center of Excellence for\nstructures and materials, so we can create new materials here, modify existing\nmaterials, and build and test a lot of\ndifferent and eccentric structures in a\nlot of different ways.\n\nNTB: Have you discovered any\nunexpected applications for these\nmaterials that may cross over into the\npublic sector?\nMcGowan: Without a doubt, we\'ve\nfound uses for these materials. I\'ll give\nyou a classic example. The THUNDER\nActuator is an actuator that was created, developed, and patented right\nhere at Langley. It is now considered\ncommercial and off the shelf. It is\nmade from smart material. It\'s being\nused in all sorts of applications, including medical and pumping applications.\nA lot of these different materials can be\ntailored for medical applications, and\nvibration suppression in washing machines, cars, trucks, and buses. If you\ncould shave five percent off the drag of\na truck, you\'d save millions of dollars\nin fuel.\nA full transcript of this inten\'iew appears\non-line at www.nasatech.com/whoswho.

Dynamic bearings usually consist\nof two parts that move ill close proximity relative to each\nother, separated by a thin film of lubricant under pressure.\nThis technology features three new sealing methods and an\nactive lubricant reservoir devised by Philips.\nThe first of the three sealing methods features an elastic 0ring held in place by a flange and i-im on the two parts. The\nsecond involves manufacturing the inner bearing part with an\nannular raised portion and the rotating outer bearing part\nwith an oblique surface. The third features a V-shaped annular recess in the outer bearing part that angles out from the\ninner bearing surface. The lubricant reservoir ensures the\ncontinuous, effective containment and distribution of lubricating fluid within the bearings.\nPhilips\' dynamic groove sealing structures and lubricant\nreservoir are suited for virtually any hearing application that\nrequires continuous motion, such as disk drives, laser scanners, CD and DVD systems, rotating magnetic recording and\nplayback heads, and spindles.\n\nwww. nasatech. corn /techsearch/tow/roche. html\n\nGet the complete report on this technology at: \r\n\nwww.nasatech.com/techsearch/tow/philips.html\n\nNew LCD Technology Enhances\nDisplay Viewing\n\nSatellite/Internet-Based Detection and\nNotification System\n\nTony Cupolo, Perimeter Technology, inc.\n\nJack Baxter, Baxter Technologies\nLiquid cista1\ndisplays (LCD)\nare found virtually everywhere\nin ncr- today\nr\t\n-sonal digital as-\t\nsistants, cell\nphones, and laptops.

Optical noses\nshould not be confused with electronic\nnoses, which are single-point sensors\nbased on chemical-induced variations of\nthe electrical resistances of carbonblack/polymer composite films. Optical\nnoses could enable rapid measurement\nof gas mixtures (e.g., volatile compounds in air) at multiple sensing locations along their lengths, which could be\nof the order of kilometers. Optical noses\ncould function well in locations where\naudio- and radio-frequency electromagnetic interference renders electronic\nnoses ineffective. Moreover, it may be\neasier to fabricate optical noses than to\nfabricate electronic noses because it\nwould not be necessary to handle carbon black.\nAn optical nose (see figure) would include a commerciall y available handheld optical time-domain reflectoineter\n(OTDR) and a fiber-optic transducer,\nwhich would typically he prepared as follows: An optical fiber would he coated\nwith a polymer that swells when it absorbs a volatile compound. The outer\nsurface of the pol y mer would be coated\nwith a gas-impermeable film. At designated sensing locations along the optical\nfiber, the impermeable film would he removed in patterns to form hallcircumference, mill i meter-wide notches\nthrough which gases could enter the\npolymer.\nThe absorption of one or more\nvolatile compounds through the notch\nat a given sensing location would give\nrise to asymmetric swelling of the pol y\n-mer;thasyicwlngoudegender shear stress which, in turn,\nwould cause local variation in the index\nof refraction of the fiber. (Optionally,\nthe notches could extend the full ciicumft\'rence, iii which case the swelling\nand the resulting shear-stress pattern\nwould be symmetric. However, the asvmnmetric configuration is preferred beNASA Tech Brief. June 2001\t\n\nwould give rise to local variations in the index ot retraction at sensing\nlocations along an optical fiber. The locations and magnitudes of these variations would be measured\nby use of optical time-domain reflectometry.\n\nVolatile Compounds in the Air\n\ncause the shear stress and the associated\nchange in the index of refraction would\nbe greater.)\nThe OTDR would launch picosecond\nlaser pulses into the optical fiber at one\nend. The index-of-refraction variations\nassociated with the presence of volatile\ncompounds at the notches would cause\npart of the incident laser light to be reflected. The OTDR would make time-resolved measurements of the intensity of\nthe reflected laser light. For a given reflected pulse, the location of the corresponding sensing notch could be inferred from the measured round-trip\npulse travel time.\nIt should be possible to construct arrays of optical noses for discrimination\namong different volatile compounds.\nEach fiber-optic transducer in such an\narray would be coated with a different\npo1yi1ei-, which would be chosen so that\nthe index-of-refraction response of this\ntransducer to different volatile compounds of interest would differ from the\ncorresponding responses of the other\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\ntransducers. For automated or semniautomated operation, the readouts of all the\ntransducers in the array could be digitized, then processed by principal-component-analysis and pattern-recognition\nalgorithms to discriminate the volatile\ncompounds of interest.\nThis work was done fry Adrian Ponce and\nDmmtri Kossakooski of Caltec/m fir NASA\'s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory.

To achieve compactness and low mass - and thus low-power\nconsumption - the resonator is micromachined out of silicon. In addition to\nthe resonator, the device includes an\nelectronic circuit that drives the oscilla-\n\ntion and effectively measures the resonance quality factor (Q), which is inversely proportional to the rate of damping.\nThe drive circuit generates a drive\nvoltage that alternates at the frequency\nof the mechanical resonance.

The circuit includes a feedback loop that measures\nthe amplitude of the oscillation and adjusts the drive voltage to maintain the oscillation at a preset amplitude.\nAt a given time, the magnitude of\nthe drive voltage needed to maintain\nthe preset amplitude of oscillation depends on the rate of damping and thus\non the pressure at that time. Accordingly, the magnitude of the drive voltage developed by the feedback loop is\nsampled and taken as an indication of\npressure.\nThe overall sensitivity of the device depends partly on the intrinsic Q of the\nresonator (the Q that the resonator\nwould exhibit during operation in a perfect vacuum) and partly on the sensitivity of the drive circuit. Inasmuch as the\nintrinsic Q of a micromachined resonator like the one used in this device\ntypically ranges from 100,000 to 200,000,\nhigh sensitivity to pressure can be\nachieved readily.\nThe device can be designed to have a\nwide dynamic range. For example, an\nearly version of the device was found to\nindicate pressures in the range of 10\' to\n10-2\ntorr (approximately 10- to 1 Pa)\nwith nearly linear response over a large\npart of that range (see figure). It should\nhe possible to extend the upper limit of\nthis pressure range to as much as 10 atm\n(approximately 1 MPa) and the lower\n-6\nlimit to <,() torr (<10-\'Pa) by slight\nmodifications of the resonator and drive\ncircuit.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe feasibility of a capacitive sensor for\nmeasuring the level of liquid nitrogen in\na container has been demonstrated. The\nbasic sensor design could also readily be\nadapted to measurement of the levels of\ncryogenic liquids other than nitrogen.\nThe general concept of capacitive sensors is not new. The novel aspect of this\nparticular capacitive sensor lies in the use\nof the liquid nitrogen as part of the dielectric of a capacitor. Two vertically parallel, electrically conductive plates constitute the electrodes of the capacitor and\nare partly immersed in the liquid from\nthe top, so that the top surface of the liquid lies somewhere along the plates. As\nthe level of the liquid varies, the amount\nof dielectric material between the plates,\nand thus the capacitance, also varies. It is\npossible to compute the level of the liquid from (1) a measurement of the capacitance or a quantity related to capacitance in a known way and (2) the known\nrelationship between the liquid level and\nthe capacitance.\nSeveral other types of sensors for measuring the levels of cryogenic liquids are\navailable. The transducers in those sensors include, variously, cryodiodes, carbon resistors, hot-wire sensors, and simple floats. Each type is disadvantageous\nin one or more ways:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cryodiodes are expensive (costing\nabout $500 apiece), and the electrical\ncurrents through them must be conditioned in order to enable detection of\nliquid/vapor interfaces for proper\nmeasurement of liquid levels.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Because carbon resistors are insensitive to liquid/vapor interfaces, they\ngive only rough indications of the levels of cryogenic liquids.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hot-wire sensors can give inaccurate\nreadings when liquids boil next to the\nwires.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Simple floats provide good visual indications of liquid levels, but their outputs cannot be fed directl y to computer data-acquisition systems.\nThe first step in the development of\nthe present capacitive sensor was to establish the relative permittivity of liquid\nnitrogen ( = 1.454), gaseous nitrogen\n(1.0005480), and air (1.0005364) at the\nboiling temperature of liquid nitrogen at\nstandard atmospheric pressure. The dcctrodes of a prototype of this sensor were\nmade from two copper-clad circuit\nboards with a thickness of 0.010 in. (0.254\nmm), a length of 10 in. (25.4 cm), and a\nwidth off in. (2.54 cm).

The plate structure was\nplaced inside a Dewar flask, into which\nliquid nitrogen was poured. As the liquid\nlevel increased, the capacitance of the\n\nplate structure likewise increased. In subsequent demonstrations, this prototype\nsensor performed consistentl y, and thus\nits capability was proved conclusively.\nThis work wa.o done &\' Tim E.

These range from\na receiver to determine precise (1-cm\nradial accuracy goal for JASON-1) orbits, to missions using the GPS signals\nfor remote sensing of the Earth\'s atmosphere. The BJ receiver follows the\nTurboRogue space receiver, which was\nsuccessfull y used in collaboration with\nengineers and scientists at JPL on five\nsatellite missions. While the TurboRogue was initially designed as a\nhigh-accuracy ground receiver, the BJ\nwas designed from the start as an instrument for use from orbit. The BJ\ncontains many innovations to better\nsuit it to this application. In order to\nsimplify the analog electronics, it directly samples the amplified and filtered RE (radio-frequency) signal.\nThis sampling produces two sample\nstreams in quadrature for improved\nSNR (signal-to-noise ratio). The BJ\n\nsemicustom Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) uses a full matrix switch so that inputs from multiple antennas can be directed to any of\n48 tracking channels. Other ASIC capabilities are telemetry reception,\ntone tracking, and precise time tagging of external events. Although the\nreceiver is designed as a science instrument rather than for mission-critical operation, it does contain innovative features such as the capabilit y to\noperate in a bit-grab mode. In the\nevent the highl y-redundant digital\nprocessing fails, the main processor\nstops, or the spacecraft can no longer\npower the GPS receiver, the BJ can\nturn on for less than a second every\nhour, and still transmit data to the\nground allowing sub-100-m orbit determination. The BJ receiver is designed with excess processor capacity\nto allow it to perform non-GPS functions; for example, on the GRACE mission, the BJ controls an intersatellite\nK-band link and also processes the\n\noutput of a star camera to determine\nspacecraft attitude.\nThis work was done by Thomas Meehan,\nJeffrey Srinivasan, Jeffrey Tien, Garth\nFranklin, Donovan Spitzmesser, Timothy\nMunson. and Charles Dunn of Co/tech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Heretofore, fuzz y membership functions have been implemented, variously, by use of purely analog or purely digital circuits. Purely\ndigital circuits afford flexibility at the\ncost of less speed and greater circuit\narea. Purely analog circuits offer\ngreater speed and occupy less area but\ntend to be limited in flexibility and\nprogrammability. The present invention takes advantage of both the programmability of digital circuitry and\nthe speed and compactness of analog\ncircuitry. The analog aspect of the invention creates the potential for highspeed parallel processing with relatively low power consumption.\nIn designing a circuit according to\nthe invention, one uses current-mode\ncircuitry to implement fuzzification in\na fully parallel architecture while using\n\na digital interface for programmability\nof attributes of membership functions.\nIn a typical case, a membership-function circuit accepts an analog input potential and implements a trapezoidal\nmembership function (see figure).\nFirst, the input potential signal (X) is\nconverted to a current-mode signal\n(Ii,) for further processing. Two current-mode digital-to-analog converters\n(DACs) provide currents I, and \'R that\nrepresent zero-crossing locations of the\nleft and right legs, respectively, of the\ntrapezoidal membership function.\nCurrent suhtractors generate I. and J - Ii ,,, and feed these difference\ncurrents as analog inputs to dividing\ndigital-to-analog converters (DlvDACs). [Alternatively, one could use\nmultiplying digital-to-analog converters (M-DAC5); the advantage of DlvDACs is that they provide more evenly\nspaced increments, which makes the\nrange of programmable slopes more\n\nuseful.] The digital input to each DIVDAC is a number inversely proportional to the slope of the corresponding leg of the trapezoidal membership\nfunction. In each DIV.DAC, the analog\ndifference-current input is divided by\nthe digital inverse-slope input to obtain the ordinate on the affected leg of\nthe trapezoid. A comparator circuit selects the output of either the left- or\nthe right-leg DIV-DAC, and a limiting\ncircuit clips the output at a level corresponding to the top of the trapezoid.\nThe output current of the limiting circuit is converted to an output voltage.\nThis work was done by Tyson Thomas and\nDavid We/don of Ca/tech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The receiver in the transponder\nlocks onto the uplink carrier signal, demodulates the ranging signal, and remodulates the ranging signal onto another carrier signal (denoted the\ndownlink carrier signal), which is coherently related to the uplink carrier. A receiver at the master station locks to the\ndownlink carrier signal and demodulates the ranging signal. Finally, the received ranging signal is correlated with\nthe transmitted ranging signal, and the\noffset between the two signals that yields\nthe maximum correlation amplitude\nconstitutes the estimate of the roundtrip signal travel time.\nIn this case, the ranging signal would\nbe a pseudonoise binary sequence that\nwould be phase-modulated onto the uplink carrier. Pseuclonoise binar y sequences have been used before in turnaround ranging of spacecraft because\ntheyoffer a desirable combination of\nhigh ranging resolution, low ranging\nambiguity, and no need for receivers to\n"know" when pseudonoise sequences\nstarted.\nThe need for regeneration of the\npseuclonoise sequence (or, for that matter, any other ranging signal) in a\ntransponder arises as follows: In the\ntransponder, in the absence of regeneration, uplink noise is received along with\nthe ranging signal, so that unavoidably,\nthe uplink noise is modulated onto the\ndownlink carrier along with the ranging\nsignal. Iii a typical deep-space application, the retransmitted uplink noise\npower can exceed the retransmitted\nranging power by as much as 30 to 40\ndB. Thus, a considerable amount of\npower that could otherwise be used for\ntelemetry or other purposes is wasted retransmitting the uplink noise, and the\nretransmitted noise degrades the ranging signal received at the Earth or other\nmaster station.

Part of this task is to determine the current phase of\nthe ranging signal. Assuming that the ranging signal is frequency-coherent with the uplink carrier signal, following standard practice in turnaround ranging, the proposed technique\nwould involve locking to the received uplink carrier signal to\nobtain a timing signal for a numerically controlled oscillator in\na pseudonoise-sequence-tracking loop (also called a "chiptracking" loop).\nBecause the ranging signal would look like a square-wave signal except for an occasional flip in polarity, the phase of the\nsignal would he tracked by use of a first-order square-wave\nphase-locked loop. The nature of the pseudonoise sequence\nwould be such that the tracking phase error would average out\nto zero in the long term, and the effect of the tracking phase\nerror could be diminished through low-pass filtering. Because\nthe phase-error output of a phase-locked loop is proportional\nto the signal amplitude, which can vary widely, an automatic\ngain control (AGC) would be necessary for normalizing the\namplitude before input to the loop filter. The reference amplitude signal for the AGC would be the amplitude of the signal in the in-phase channel of the carrier-tracking loop.\nThe chip-tracking loop would contain correlators instead of\na traditional lock detector. The correlators would integrate\nover a desired number of pseudonoise-repetition periods\n(chips), and the current position relative to the pseudonoise\nsequence would be determined from the correlator outputs.\nThe timing of the transmitting pseudo noise-sequence generator would he set accordingly, and the numerically controlled\noscillator in the chip-tracking loop would be used to clock the\nbinary modulation sequence to the downlink transmitter. After\neach integration period, the current positions in the transmitted and received pseudonoise sequences would compared;\nagreement of these positions would signi\' lock.\nThis work was done by Jeff Bern er James M.

Starting from the beginning of\na pulse cycle, a membrane potential rises\nat rate that decays exponentially until\nthe potential passes a time-varying\nthreshold, at which point the neuron\nsends a spike along its axon. At the in-\n\nstant of the spike, the membrane potential returns to a resting level from which\nthe cycle starts anew. If the threshold,\nthe resting potential, or the rate of rise\nof the membrane potential is modulated, then the pulse-repetition rate\n(also called the "spiking frequency" or\nthe "firing rate") of the neuron is\nchanged.\nBy locally connecting neurons like\nthis one into an array in which the axons\nof neighbors would transmit their spike\ntrains via synapto-dendritic connections\nthat would modulate the thresholds, one\n\ncould construct a complex processing\nnetwork. In a computational simulation,\nsuch a network has been shown to he capable of invariant mapping of binary\npatterns.\nThe invariance of the mapping is a result of encoding images in time rather\nthan space. In particular, if the same\nimage is fed as input to a different set of\npixels but the same spatial relationships\nare maintained among parts of the\nimage, the temporal representation of\nthe image remains the same and the\nmapping is invariant to translation. Invariance with respect to brightness is\nachieved partly by recognizing that\ngreater brightness is represented simply\nby a uniform increase in the average firing rates of all affected neurons.\nThe upper part of Figure 2 depicts a\ndevelopmental spiking-neuron circuit.\nThe clock voltage source (%z jk) pumps\ncharge through a subthreshold biased\ntransistor (Ml) onto the gate capacitance of transistor M2, the gate potential of which represents the membrane\npotential.

When the membrane potential\nbecomes high enough to pull M3 out\nof its linear current-vs-voltage region,\nthe voltage at the swing node rapidly\ndecreases as M2 pulls the node toward\nground. The low voltage on the swing\nnode then triggers the inverter formed\nwith M4 and M5 to go high, and the inverter potential is digitally buffered to\nthe output terminal. The clocked\nswitching transistor M7 latches the voltage output on the noncharging portion of the cycle of the current pump at\nMl. M8 and M9 are sized to constitute\nan inverter that triggers at a relatively\nhigh dc potential to insure an adequate\nspike amplitude before the discharge\ntransistor M6 is activated. When M6 is\nswitched on, all charge at the membrane is drained to ground (zero potential) or, alternatively, to a source of\nnonzero resting potential connected to\nthe source terminal of M6. When the\nmembrane potential falls, M2 shuts\ndown and the swing node is pulled\nhigh again as M3 returns to its linear\nregion. This change in the swing node\nreturns the output to low, ending the\n\nspike and switching off the discharge\ntransistor at M6.\nThe lower part of Figure 2 shows a\nsynapto-dendritic input circuit connected\nto the swing node of a spiking neuron. In\na locally connected network, there could\nbe eight input circuits like this one for\ncoupling the outputs from eight nearestneighbor neurons as inputs to the affected neuron. Transistor Msl sets the\ngain of the coupling, while transistor Ms2\ncontrols the timing. Essentially, the spike\nfrom a neighboring neuron injects\ncharge onto the gate of Ms3 through\nMsl. This charge then slowly leaks away\nvia Ms2 to produce a decaying exponential culTent response through Ms3. This\ncurrent modulates the threshold of the\nspiking neuron by pulling M3 closer to\nsaturation, thereby enabling a decreased\nmembrane potential to trigger a spike.\nThis work was done by Tyson Thomas of\nCaltech far NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

As explained in more detail in\nthe earlier article, the intermittency of\nthe operation of the microprocessorcontrolled strain-gauge circuit would\ncontribute a major portion of the reduction in time-averaged power. A further\n\nreduction would be effected by use of a\nstrain gauge of unusually high electrical\nresistance - about 3 M instead of the\ncustomary value of about 120 92. Ordinarily, the use of the lower resistance\nwould be dictated by the need to minimize noise pickup on strain-gauge-output wires, where the noise voltage can be\ncomparable to the strain-gauge output\nvoltage. In this case, however, the straingauge circuit would be very small and\none could mount the rest of the straingauge circuit very close to the strain\ngauge; this would make it possible to\nshorten the electrical connections and\nthereby reduce noise pickup, enabling\nthe use of the higher gauge resistance\nwithout incurring excessive noise.\nA preliminary estimate shows that\nwith a 3-ku strain gauge and associated\ncircuitry operating at a supply potential\nof 3 V at a sampling rate of twice per\nsecond with sampling periods 100 Vs\nlong, the overall time-averaged power\nconsumption would be about 12 pW. A\n\ntypical calculator-type solar battery supplies a current of about 10 pA at a potential of 3 V (power of about 30 1iW)\nunder full illumination. Thus, one such\nbattery would provide at least 50 percent\npower margin to allow for reduced illumination.\nAs explained in the earlier article, the\nstrain-gauge circuit would automatically\ncorrect for variations in the supply voltage. The microprocessor in the straingauge circuit could also be programmed\nto correct for nonlinearity in the straingauge response, and to provide a digitally controlled analog offset to correct\nfor tare weight.\nThis work was done by Shannon P Jackson and Harold Kirkham of Caltech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

ARDS can be used\n50\t\n\nto analy ze the dynamics of such diverse\nmachines as turbocompressors, turbopumps, gas turbines, steam turbines coupled with electric generators, power-transmission shafts, and other rotating\nmachinery in which the flexibility of shafts\nis significant. Researchers at Arizona State\nUniversity wrote the original version of\nAi,DS in the FORTRAN 77 language during the early 1980s for execution on a\nmainframe computer. Retaining the original FORTRAN 77 language and capabilities, the code was modified into the present version, denoted ARDS-PC, for\nexecution on personal computers. ARDSPC is also readily convertible to a FORTRAN 90 version for personal computers.\nARDS utilizes finite-element analysis\nand component-mode synthesis to quickly\nand accurately calculate transient and\nsteady-state rotor responses. The program\nincludes a fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator that uses a fixed time step specified\nby the user. ARDS can compute transient\nresponses to four types of excitation: turns\nof entire machines about axes other than\nshaft axes (these turns affect rotor behavior through gyroscopic effects), variable\nbase acceleration, variable applied forces,\nand suddenly applied imbalance (e.g., loss\nof a blade). The effects of squeeze-film\ndampers and dropping onto (and thus\nrubbing against) backup bearings and the\nfinite stiffness of bearings (including magnetic bearings) can be included in simulations. The customary steady-state responses, including natural frequencies,\ncritical speeds, and effect of rotor imbalance can all he calculated.\nAdditional functions in ARDS-PC include (1) estimating the peak response\nfollowing loss of a blade without resorting\nto a full transient analysis; (2) calculation\nof sensitivity of response to input parameters; (3) formulation of optimum\nrotor and damper designs that are optimized in the sense that critical speeds are\nplaced in desirable ranges or bearing\nloads are minimized; and (4) generation\nof Poincar\xc3\xa9 plots so the presence of\nchaotic motion can be ascertained.\nARDS-PC produces printed and plotted output. The executable code uses\nthe full array sizes of the mainframe version and fits on a high-density floppy\ndisc. ARDS-PC can be executed on personal computers equipped with \'486 (or\nmore capable) processors that utilize the\nDOS operating system with an extended\nmemory manager.\nwww.isasatech.com\t\n\nThis program was written by David P\nFleming of Glenn Research Center.

As explained below, an\nadditive of this type exerts beneficial\nelectrochemical effects both within the\nbulk of the electrolyte and on the surface of the carbon anode, such that the\nlow-temperature electrical characteristics of the cell are improved.\nThe discovery of lithium alkoxide\nelectrolyte additives was made during\ncontinuing research directed toward extending the range of practical operating\ntemperatures from the present lower\nlimit of-20 \xc2\xb0C down to \xe2\x80\x9440 \xc2\xb0C, and even\nlower if possible. This research at earlier\nstages was reported in "Update on Electrolytes for Low-Temperature Lithium\nCells" (NPO-20407), NASA Tech Briefs,\nVol. 24, No. 1, (January, 2000), page 56.\nTo recapitulate: the loss of performance\nwith decreasing temperature is attributable largely to a decrease of ionic conductivity and the increase in viscosity of\nthe electrolyte. What is needed to extend the minimum operating temperature from \xe2\x80\x9420 "C down to \xe2\x80\x9440 \xc2\xb0C is a stable electrolyte solution with relatively\nsmall low-temperature viscosity, a large\nelectric permittivity, adequate coordina-\n\ndon behavior, and appropriate ranges\nof solubilities of liquid and salt constituents.\nThe electrolytes investigated intensively at earlier stages of this research\nwere made of LiPF 5 mixed with various\nproportions of aliphatic carbonates. One\noptimal formulation that was found to\nyield excellent room- and low-temperature performance is a 1.0 M solution of\nLiPF6 in a solvent that consists of equal\nvolume parts of ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate.\nPrototype cells that contained this electrolyte exhibited high charge and discharge capacities at temperatures from\n\xe2\x80\x9420 to \xe2\x80\x9440 "C, capability for discharge at\nhigh rates, and high cycle lives at both\nlow and room temperatures.\nA lithium alkoxide additive helps to\nimprove the low-temperature performance of a cell in the following two ways:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A film forms on the surface of the carbon\nanode. Whether the anode is made of\ngraphitic or nongraphitic carbon, the\nsurface film acts as a solid/electrolyte interface, the nature of which is critical to\nlow-temperature performance. Desirably,\nthe surface film would exert a protective\neffect yet would remain conductive to\nlithium ions to facilitate intercalation of\nlithium. The effect of the lithium alkox-\n\n0\nCH 3\n\n\t\n\nide additive is to render the surface film\nmore favorable in these respects.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This results in the formation of asymmetric carbonates via a disproportionation reaction, such as ethyl methyl\ncarbonate in the electrolyte solution\ndescribed above. Thus, this approach\nrepresents a novel method of introducing asymmetric carbonates, which\nhave been identified as being beneficial to low-temperature characteristics,\ninto electrolyte formulations.\nThis work was done by Marshall Smart,\nRatnakumar Bugga, and Subbarao Surampudi of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

EMC is an asymmetric\naliphatic carbonate, and, as noted in the\nfirst of the two immediately preceding\narticles, asymmetric carbonates confer\ncertain benefits. In the research deNASA Tech Briefs, June 2001\t\n\nscribed in that article, the asymmetric\ncarbonates were formed in situ, in reactions catalyzed by lithium alkoxide additives. In contrast, the present finding\nthat EMC is a suitable cosolvent was\nmade by following a different approach;\nnamely, formulating the electrolyte solvents to include an asymmetric aliphatic\ncarbonate - EMC - in the first place.\nThe table shows the compositions of\nelectrolytes used in experiments on the\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\neffects of using EMC as a cosolvent.\nThese compositions were chosen on the\nbasis of the expectation of the beneficial\neffects of adding a low-viscosity, lowmelting-temperature solvent (in this\ncase, EMC) to carbonate solvent mixtures that had previously been observed\nto have desirable stabilizing and passivating qualities.

The\nresults of the experiments were interpreted in terms of stability of SEIs, kinetics of intercalation of lithium into\n\ngraphite electrodes, and electrical conductivities of electrolytes. In the formulations studied, the addition of EMC exerted no observable adverse effects on\nthe SEIs or on the kinetics; instead, the\naddition of EMC was found to reduce\nlow-temperature film resistances and to\nenhance the kinetics and the discharge\ncharacteristics. The best low-temperature\nelectrical performance was observed in\nthe case of the electrolyte with the highest EMC content; this is consistent with\nthe lower (relative to the other carbonate solvents) viscosity and freezing temperature of EMC.\nThis work was done bv Marshall Smart,\nRatnakumar Bugga, and Subbarao Surampudi of Galtech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

Among other things, high polarization resistances make it necessary\nto charge and discharge at low rates in some cases as low as 1= c/100, where\nI is the charge or discharge current in\namperes and Cis the nominal charge capacity in ampere-hours.\nTwo major reasons for choosing TiS2\nas a candidate alternative anode material are that (1) the diffusivity of Li in\nTiS2 is high and (2) solid/electrolyte interphases are not expected to form on\nthe surfaces of TiS2 electrodes because\nthe voltage of TiS2 versus Li in the fully\ndischarged condition (1.7 V) lies within\nthe stability window of state-of-the-art\nelectrolytes for lithium-ion cells.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA method that exploits rapid prototyping has been conceived to reduce\nthe time and cost associated with the\nproduction of small quantities of composite-material parts that have complex shapes. In this method, mandrels\nand dies used in forming composite\nlayups are sized and shaped by molding them on rapid-prototype masters\nand are made of disintegrating mold\nmaterial (DMM). The method is particularly suitable for manufacturing\nventilating air ducts and water ducts\nfor the International Space Station and\nmanifolds and ducts for low-temperature [<350 \xc2\xb0F (<177 \xc2\xb0C)] fluids in aircraft and other vehicles. For the space\nprogram, this method is most advanta-\n\ngeous when the quantities desired are\nlow - typically fewer than 10 copies of\nthe same manifold or other design for\na specific application.\nIn a related prior method, master\nparts are made of plaster; fabrication is\ndifficult, guided by standard paper\ndrawings, and often subject to workmanship errors. In this prior method,\nplaster is cast against a plaster master\npart, then split along appropriate lines\nto create a slush mold. Next, the slush\nmold is filled with DMM, which is a special plaster. The part thus formed in\nDMM is then used as a die or mandrel\nfor la y up of a composite-material part.\nThe DMM mandrel is not reusable; it\nmust be remade for each part to be\n\nmanufactured. The temporal and monetary costs of building the master part\nand the slush mold and associated tooling are often greater than the other\ncosts of the three or four detailed\ncopies typically manufactured from\neach master part.\nIn the present method, neither a plaster master nor a slush mold is used.

These savings are attributable mostly to elimination of the\nslush molds and associated tooling. In\none application at Johnson Space Center, the method was found to cut weeks\noff the time needed to build the first\npart and to reduce the cost of the part\nby more than $8,000. The present\nmethod also affords greater accuracy,\ntolerances of \xc2\xb10.005 in. ( =0.13 mm)\n\nbeing normal. The present method also\neliminates the need for reworking masters because the rapid-prototype masters are made from computer-aideddrawing data. The total saving, relative\nto the prior method, is expected to\namount to about 75 percent; this translates to >5240,000 per year at NASA\'s\nPalmdale, California site alone.\nThe present method has also been\nconsidered for use in a Marshall Space\nFlight center program in which a few\ncomposite-material parts are fabricated\nb\'., among other things, wrapping tapes\n\ndirectly on a stereo] ithographic master.\nThe present method has shown potential to enhance the program by making\nit possible to reduce the number of steps\nin fabricating the master and increasing\nthe accuracy of the master.\nThis work was done l Robert E.

One of the\ntraditional procedures for rounding a corner on a rectangular metal sheet is to first\nmake a rough cut with a band saw and/or\nhand metal snips, then to file the roughly\ncut edge; this procedure is time-consuming and does not result in an accurate radius. The use of a punch-and-die set of the\npresent type takes less time and results in\na corner with an accurate radius.\nThe figure shows a punch and die of\nthe present type. Of course, the dimensions of the punch and die must be chosen to suit the thickness of the metal\nsheet and the corner radius to be\nformed. Thus far, punch-and-die sets\nhave been made for sheet thicknesses up\nto 0.125 in. (=3.2 mm) and corner radii\nfrom 0.2 to 2 in. (= 5 to 51 mm).\nThis work was done bi Cecil L.

Superheated steam enters the\nreactor through holes in the bottom and\nflows out freely at the top. The sand is a\nhigh heat capacity medium used for\nheating the biomass. The biomass particles, initially at room temperature, are\nintroduced into the already hot reactor\nand become heated primarily through\ncontact with the sand. Upon reaching a\nthreshold temperature, the biomass particles undergo chemical reactions, the\ngaseous products of which are carried\naway by the flow of steam. The "bubbles"\n\nare regions of the fluidized bed that are\nmostly devoid of particles; these regions\noccur as a result of the interaction of the\nturbulent gaseous flow with the particles.\nThe mathematical model is one of\nmultiphase flow. The mixture of biomass\nand sand is regarded as a particulate\nphase divided into two classes of particles\nthat interact with a flowing gas phase. Initially, the solid biomass is regarded as\nconsisting of three chemical species: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. From\neach of these initial species, two new solid\nspecies are generated during pyrolysis: an\n"active" species and a char. The gas phase\nis regarded as consisting of the original\ncarrier gas (steam), plus tar and gas that\nare generated through pyrolysis.\n\nThe model includes equations for the\nconservation of mass, momentum, enthalpy, and chemical species. The conservation equations for the particles are\nderived from the Boltzmann equations\nthrough ensemble averaging. The particulate-phase stresses are expressed as a\ntensor sum of collisional and Reynolds\ncontributions; contributions from collisions between particles of different\nclasses are included. The conservation\nequations for the gaseous phase are the\nNavier-Stokes equations augmented by\nthe species and energy equations and by\nthe perfect gas law. A distinctive feature\nof these equations are the source/sink\nterms portraying the dynamic interaction between particles and gas phase.\n\nProtective Eyewear:\nvisors, goggles,\nspectacles\nSpecialty Eyewear:\nsports, ophthalmic,\nsunglasses\nCall 978-250-4200 or email nanotuf@tritonsystems.com\nWindshields: airplane\nand transportation\nvehicles\n\ntoday for more information.\n\nJ\n\nTriton Systems, Inc. .

Such\nalignment is not consistent with the recirculating flows that occur in fluidized beds.\nInstead, in this model, turbulence is repre-\n\nsented by the equations of the full differential Reynolds stress model (DRSM) for\ntwo-phase flows. Some of the terms in the\nDRSM equations are mathematical submodels that have yet to be defined. It will\nbe necessary to complete the modeling of\nRe ynolds stresses for both the gaseous and\nthe particulate phases in order to close\nthe system of governing equations.\nThe model is extremely complex because of the coupled nature of the dynamic and thermodynamic evolution of\nthe phases, and because of the turbulent\nfeatures of the gaseous carrier and particulate flows. Because many of the aspects of\n\nthe model are novel, it is expected that the\nfirst numerical simulations to be performed by use of the model will be those\nof sand/biomass dynamics in absence of\nheat transfer, turbulence, or chemical reactions. The results of the first simulations\nshould enable the validation of the parts\nof the model that represent the dynamic\ninteraction between phases and the particulate stress tensor.\nThis work was done by Josette Bellizn and\nDann) Laihouwers of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Glenn Research Center,\nCleveland, Ohio\nA portable apparatus that operates at\natmospheric pressure generates a beam\nof monatomic oxygen. The apparatus is\ndesigned to be used in a dry, noncontact\nprocess for removing organic contaminants from the surfaces of paintings. Organic contaminants that can be wholly or\npartly removed by use of this apparatus\ninclude some deposited in acts of defacement (e.g., lipstick and marks left by felttip and ball-point pens) and some deposited from fire (e.g., soot and charred\nbinder). In some cases, this apparatus\nmay make it possible to restore works of\nart that were previously counted as lost.\nThe use of monatomic oxygen to remove undesired organic materials from\nthe surfaces of paintings was reported in\nseveral articles in previous issues of NASA\nTech Briefr namely, "Atomic Oxygen Removes Varnish and Lacquer From Old\nPaintings" (LEW-16031), Vol. 20, No. 4\n(April 1996), page 61; and "Cleaning\nSoot From Oil Paintings With Monatomic Oxygen" (LEW-15896), NASA Tech\nBriefs, Vol. 20, No. 10 (October 1996),\npage 110. Monatomic oxygen reacts with\ncarbonaceous deposits on the surfaces of\npaintings, converting the carbon to CO\nand CO2 and converting any hydrogen\ncontent of the deposit to H 2O vapor.\nConventional techniques for cleaning\npaintings involve the use of solvents,\nwhich are not effective in some defacement cases and cases of severe fire damage. In contrast, the use of wonatomic\noxygen causes the removal of caihonaceous deposits at controlled rates, and\ncleaning can be stopped at any point.\nThe cited prior articles describe placing each painting to he cleaned in a vacuum chamber, where it was exposed to\nmonatomic oxygen from either a plasma\nor a beam source. The present atmospheric-pressure apparatus makes a vacuum chamber unnecessary. In this apparatus, monatomic oxygen is generated in\na dc arc in a mixture of oxygen flowing\nat rate of 0.1 to 0.2 L/min and helium\nflowing at a rate of 4.3 L/min. The role\nof the helium is to inhibit the recombination of monatomic oxygen into diatomic oxygen.\nNASA Tech Bnefli, June 2001\t\n\n150 MHz DSP, 2 OMNIBUS sites seeks long\nterm relationship with intelligent end-user.\n\n-,\nCall anytime 805-520-3300.\n\nnow\nFeatures\nOMNIBUS modules to uitom tailor your\nembedded solution!\n\nA04\t\nA4D1\t\nA16D2\t\nAD16\t\nAD40\t\n\n401\t\n\n16-br 0-2006266\n\n401\t\n\n16-bit\t\n\n0-200kHz\n\n40h\t\n\n14-bit\t\n\nI 01\t\n\n14-bit\t\n\n0-10MHz\n\n0-10111Hz\n\n16th. 16-bit 0-196626,\n20h\t\n\n12-bit\t\n\n401\t\n\n16-5,1 0451,1Hz\n\n0-40MHz\n\n401.\t\n\n16-bit\t\n\n0-200 kHz\n\n0th.\t\n\n12-bit\t\n\n0-65Mhz\n\n2th.\t\n\n12-bit\t\n\nSD\t\nServol6\t\n\n24-bit\t\n\n2-96kHz\n\n4th.\t 24-bit 50-96kHz\n\n16(6-\t\n\n16-bit\t\n\n0-1011 6Hz\n\n16(6\t\n\n1, Noise Cancellation\nEmbedded Control\nWide-Channel Audio\nPrecision Motion Control\n\n"S Mutt\n\n4th,\t\n\nMOT\n\nRF\t\n\nApplications\n\nISO MHz TMS320C671I\nfloating-point DSP\nOperates independently\nfrom a host PC\nPlug-n-Play USB interface\nP.

Wavelets, being localized in both time and frequency (or\nspace and wave number), serve as means\nfor transforming and extracting information from signals that have temporally or\nspatially varying properties. In a sense,\nwavelet methods combine the best features of time and frequency methods\n(e.g.. Fourier-transform methods). Modem wavelet research began in the mid1980s, but until now, there has been no\ncommercially available, general-purpose\nsoftware to support rapid prototyping for\nresearch on, and application of, wavelets.\nS+Wavelets satisfies the need for such a\ncomputer code.\nS+Wavelets provides a variety of transform objects for one- and two-dimensional\nsets of data, including the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The discrete wavelet transform with orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelets;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multiresolution analysis and decompositions;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wavelet-packet and cosine-packet trans- forms with best-basis selection;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Matching pursuits decompositions;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Robust and outlier-resistant wavelet\ntransforms;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Translation-invariant (nondecimated)\nwavelet transforms;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Decompositions of signals into atomic\nwaveforms; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Estimates of signals through wavelet\nshrinkage\n\nS+Wavelets is available as part of a software system called "S-PLUS." S+Wavelets\nsupports such basic S-PLUS functions as\nprint, plot, and summary, specializing\nthese features and functions for wavelet\nobjects. Other basic S-PLUS generic functions supported in S+Wavelets include\nsubscript and assignment operators, arithmetic and logical operators, mathematical\nfunctions, and a suite of "tools" that assist\nin visualization of data. The visualization\ntools include autocorrelation-function\nplots, box plots, bar plots, dot charts, his-tograms, and quantile-quan tileplots. All of\nthese functions are specialized for wavelet\nobjects; for example, in the case of a discrete wavelet transform, side-by-side box\nplots would depict wavelet coefficients\ngrouped by resolution levels.\nS+Wavelets introduces several new functions that are especially useful for wavelet\nanalysis. These include provisions for displaying a palate of "interesting" views,\ntime-scale and time-vs-frequency plots,\ntransfer-function plots, evaluation of\nFourier transforms of wavelets, plots of energy-concentration efficiencies of waveforms, and plots for visualizing the type of\ntransform basis selected for analysis.\nS-i-Wavelets offers the following other\ncapabilities and features that are important for wavelet analysis:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Perfect Reconstruction - All transform\nobjects can be inverted to recover original signals to within round-off errors.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dual Implementation in S-PLUS and C\n- Most of the algorithms in S+Wavelets\n\nare implemented in both the S-PLUS\nand C languages for flexibility and efficiency. The S-PLUS versions are used to\nmake modifications and extensions,\nwhile the C versions are ordinarily used\nto perform computations.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ability to Create New Wavelet Filters Users can create their own wavelets and\nwavelet filters for use in addition to, or\nin place of, built-in wavelets and filters.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Support for Arbitrarily Sized Signals Most transforms can be applied to a signal or image of any size, and are not restricted to sample sizes divisible by integer powers of 2.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Variety of Boundary Conditions Boundary-treatment rules and boundary conditions accommodated in\nS+Wavelets include periodic, reflection, zero, polynomial extension, and\ninternal wavelets.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wavelet Matrix Filter Operations Matrix filter operations can be created\nfor wavelet transforms. This is useful\nfor education and research.\nThis work was done by Andrew Bruce and\nHong-Ye Goo of MathSoft, Inc., for Stennis\n\nSpace Center.\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517, the\ncontractor has elected to retain title to this invention.

Since 1983, All has provided thousands of customers\nwith F/I\'s ranging from the smallest six-axis sensor in the world (17 mm diameter) to sensors measuring thousands of pounds. The F/I can\nprovide data via voltage outputs, RS-232 serial or interface with either ISA, PCI, PCMCIA or cP(l buses. All is developing interfaces to Firewire,\nVXI, USB, DeviceNet and Ethernet. The F/i\' can also interface with analog data acquisition systems (seven channels required).\nFor more information, contact Milton Gore at mgore@ati-ia.com or extension 132.\n\nINDUSTRIAL\nOur\n\n\t\n\n"IL\t\n\nISO 9001 Registered\n\nRobotic Tool Changer\nProte:\t\nSpeedev\t\nCompeasr\t\n\nRobotic Crash Protection Device\nRobotic Deburring Tool\t\nAutomated Assembly Alignment Device \t\n\nPinnacle Park, 1031 Goodworth Drive, Apex, North Carolina 21502 LISA\nTel: # 19197720115 \xe2\x80\xa2 Fax: +1.919.772.8259\nEmail: info@ati-ia.com \xe2\x80\xa2 wwwah-,o.aim\n\nFor More Information Circle No. 565\n\n'
