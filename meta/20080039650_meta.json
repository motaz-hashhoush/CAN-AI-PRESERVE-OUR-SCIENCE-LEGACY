A pulsed laser source at 1 micron based on Earth has been recorded on MLA. Simultaneously, the spacecrafts altimeter has been properly aimed and laser pulses transmitted to earth where they were detected and recorded at the same facility. This optical link was used to calibrate and verify operation of the MLA instrument and onboard laser, as well as to gain valuable information with the methods and means of very long range optical communication pointing and receiving techniques. An overview of this experiment, the hardware, and data products will be presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Netherlands", "submissionId": 20080039650, "endDate": "2006-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "a75cb13ec46345afa65e20dc639e5ba2", "id": "c9c31b1f46344dc3b4f42cca2f1a07d0"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "European Space Agency", "location": "France"}}, "meetingId": "a75cb13ec46345afa65e20dc639e5ba2", "id": "26c61eb07a2c4e919a143c566983c5cf"}], "name": "The Second ESA-NASA Working Meeting on Optoelectronics: Qualifications of Technologies and Lessons Learned from Satellite LIDAR and Altimeter Missions", "location": "Noordwijk", "id": "a75cb13ec46345afa65e20dc639e5ba2", "startDate": "2006-06-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080039650, "id": "ea566d96dc4140cb82d5316359e241ea", "publicationDate": "2006-06-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
