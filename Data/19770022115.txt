With major flights in the offing, we would like to review\nMercury concepts and hardware in the light of our development\nexperience thus far.\nThe original aims and concepts for Project Mercury, announced\nwhen it receivcd official status Oct. 5, 1958, still guide the program. The main aims of Project 3Iercury are to orbit and recover\na man in a space capsule safely and to study man\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities\ni n space. The llrrcury concept calls for simplicity and reliability.\na minimum of new developments. and a progressive build-up of\ntests to demonstrate reliability. The basic engineering approach\nhas been a drag vehicle boosted by an available ICBM propulsion\nunit; retrorockct start of descent from orbit; parachute braking\nof the final phase of re-entry; and an esciipe system {or :he launching and early-flight phases. The prcsscnt state of space-vehicle\ntcchnology indicates that the decision to base work on a high-drag\nshape for ballistic re-entry was a wise one.\nThe illustration on page 33 s h o w the Project Mercury capsule\nwith its escape system. The c.1psiile h;is a maximum diametcr of\napproximately 7.1 in. With escape rig, it is about 25 f t high.\nThe heat shield is an ablating phcmolic resin. There are t h e\nrockets in the retro unit, mounted on the heat shield. Tlic\ncapsule\xe2\x80\x99s afterbody has a sheath of cobalt-alloy shingles that can\ncxpand in all directions to minimize stress from high hentinb\nrates.\nThe cylinder atop the capsule proper contains the parnchrrte\nrecovery system. This system continues to be tested cxteiisivefv\nto insure high reliability. The capsu!e, moreover, will have 3\nr e s e w chute to back up the primary one.\nThe escape rig. tripod-mountcd above the capsule during\nlaunch can rcmove the capsule from the booster at any tirnr.\nTests uf this system simulating an off-the-pad abort. an abort 31\nmaximum d!marnic pressure on exit, and abort at very high d t i t . 2- id vclocity have all been successful. There have as YC\xe2\x80\x99t\nbeen DD booster malfunctions thnt would have prevented a safe\n\nil\n\nThe iuustratioo at left shows the capsule complete with retrorocket unit m heat shield and escape rig tripoded on top.\nCenter, an illustration of the capsule\xe2\x80\x99s internal arrangement, with the Astronaut in flight position. The drawing at\nthe right shows the position of the window and hatch added to the apmrle at the suggestion of the Astronauts.\n\nescape of the capsule from the scene of immediate\ntlunger.\nThe illustrations above depict the .4stronaut\nin the capsule. The window and egress hatch are\ntwo modifications that have been made to the capsule since its initial design. The window, directly\nabove t h e Astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s head, allo\\vs him to make\nobservations independent of a periscope. The hatch\ncmploys primacord t o cause it to fail and fall free\nwhen its handle is turned.\nSafety Built 1m\nThe capsule is complicated by the redundant\nsystems which have been added for increased safety.\nFrom right t o left, one can distinguish the antenna\ncan, two horizon scanners, parachute packase, pitch\nand yaw jets a n d associated plumbing, periscope\nhousing, instrument panel, side-arm controller. and\nsundry electronic and power packages. The environmentaI.-control system is mainly below the\n.lstronaut\xe2\x80\x99s couch. T h e capsule is completely automatic, b u t provisions have also been made for\npiloted operation. Each systcm has a backup; and\nin the area of communications, there are several\nbackups. There a r e two te!emetry systems for scnding Sack capsule and pilot data. Also, there are\non-board records which collect the same infonnation sent by telemetry.\nThe Astronaut may take over completely and\nperform all t h e functions of the automatic control\n\nsystem. Because of the parallel manual system, he\nw i U also be ab!e to fly aqy mode that might fai! on\nthe automatic system.\nLet us look at a few of the capsule systems of\nspecial interest. Seginning with the instrument\npanel, shown on page 73. The controls a n d disp!ay\non this panel arc grouped as to function. T h e group\non the left side has various pilot controls, such as\nthose concerned with the attitude-control system\nand the retrorockets. The two large handles are\nfor decompression and repressurization. Decompression worild be used to e s t i n p i s h a fire.\nT h e next group, ;i sequencing display, consists\nof a series of lights-red and green-to indicate\nwhether various Functions did or did not occur at\nthe proper time. The handle just to t h e left of each\nlight is the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s control to override and correct\nthe failure of any particular function. The light\nat the very top of this group is the abort light.\nwhich comes on if an abort is initiated. If the\nabort does not occur. the pilot can abort by w i n <\nhis left-hand grip. The switch immediately iinder\nthe abort light is the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cready\xe2\x80\x9d switch. This\nswitch is used prior to launch to light up n \xe2\x80\x9c r e d y \xe2\x80\x9d\nlight on the test conductor\xe2\x80\x99s panel in the blockhouse.\nThe next series of dials are flight instrumentation.\nT h e dials indicate acceleration, rate of descent,\naltitude, and the fuel supply in the hydrogen-peroxide tanks. The top center of the panel is the\nattitude display, which shows rate and attitudr in\npitch, roll, and yaw. T h e Astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s control of\nattitude will be aided by (CONTINUED ON PAGE 73)\n\nAugust 1960 / Astronautics 33\n\nproject Mercury Report\n(CONnNUED FROM PACE\n\n33)\n\na periscope, which is centered below\nthe instrument panel, and the window\nd i r e d y above the pane!. The .I\\strc:]aut will be able to see the horizon in\nback of the capsule throiigh this\nwindow in the normal orbital attitude\nof 14 deg, as well as in the retrofiring\nattitude of 34 deg. The periscope\nprovides the Astronaut with a vie\\\\*of\nthe earth beneath the capsule. He\nc.in control the attitude by location of\nthe earths imagc in the periscope.\nThe instrument in the left center is\n:I de;td-reckoiiing device based on a\nm a l l model of the earth, clock-driven\nt o rotiite in time with the orbit. In\nt h r right center is the main capsule\n:lock. which, in addition to firing the\nrvtrorockets, indicatrs time of day, the\nlapsed time since laulrch, and timeto-go for retrorocket firing.\nThe\n.\\stronaut aLso has an additional timeto-go dial, which he can set for any\ndesired event, and a separate stop\n\\r.ateh.\nThe instruments grouped in the\nlipper right-hand corner o f the panel\nfi~llow the environmcntal-cr)ntrol svst u n : Cabin pressure. trmperatiirr.\nrrlative humidity. and oxygen partinl\npressure; primxy-and emcrtymcv-oxyczn-supply prersure; and carbon-ditwde partial presslire clow~nstreamof\n:Le lithium hydro\\iclc canister in the\npressure-suit cmtrol system. This pnr-\n\nta of the panel also\ni\n\nh s controls for\na\n\nthe cabin-prcssure-system fans.\nA light pancl. adjacent to the environmen!al-coritrol-s).stem instruments,\ngives the Astronaut visual warning of\nmajor system failures. At the same\ntime, an alarm sortrrds when a failure\noccu~s. The Astronaut turn off the\nauditory warnins sicnal by actuating 3\ncwitch located by an associated light\nand then takes corrective action.\nWaminq lights are provided for !OSS\nin cabin pressurimtioii, depletion of\nprimarv oxygen siipply. emergencyrate mode of operation, decrease in\ncabin oxvgen partial pressure below\n3 psi, mcreasc of ciirtm-dioxide partial\npressure to 3 per cc'rit in the pressurrsuit circuit, and excessive d i n g water\nto the suit and cabin heat exchangers.\nManual Backup Controls\n\nA trlelight panel on the left console\nqives the Astronaut indication of lightevent sequential operation.\nThe\nlaunching oxygcn supply and snorkel\noperation are also shown\njs panel.\nManual backup conirc s are installec!\nadjacent to the liplits. [eatexchanger\nwater-flow controls and the emergency-rate valve cpntrol are located\non the richt console, which is not\nshown in the illustration below.\nThe instrument panel and Astronaiit\nwill be photographed in flight. In addition, instrument data will be telemetered and will be recorded on\nboard. The Astronaut's electrwardi+\n\nr\n\ngram, body temperature, and respiration rate and depth will also be taken\nand recorded on board and telemetered continuously.\nThe environmental-control system.\ndiagrammed on page 74, maintains the\nenviroiiiiicitt for the Astroiiarrt at ii\ntemperature between 50 and 90 F.\nThe Astronaut can manually select the\ntemperatiire in this range that miikes\nhim most comfortable. During reentry, when the cabin air temprrature\nmay approach 80 F, his suit will still\nmaintain its air within the desired tcmperature range. The system is capable\no operating for about 32 hr. Body\nf\nodor is relno\\ved by activated charcoal.\nand cartwn dioxide is removec! by\nlithium hydroxide.\nFresh oxygen\nenters thc suit at the torso and exits\na t the hrlmct. As oxygen leavcs the\nhelmet, it enters a debris trap, where\nsmall particles are removed, and then\ngoes through the odor and carbondioxide absorbers. A fi!ter downstream of the carbon &xi& absyfher\nprevents lithium-hydroxide dust from\ncontaminating the oxygen. Pressure\ndrop is counteracted bv an incrcasrd\nsupply of giis from the oxygen hottlc.\nTen cubic f w t per minute is the flow\nrate through the suit at anproximately\n5 psi. Considering the fact that this\nsvstem only weighs about 130 Ib. it\nrepresents indeed a noteworthy engineering accomplishment.\nAmong the more complex systems in\nthe capsule is the one for automatic\nstabilization and control.

The history of all parts go1 1 1 ~into a particular booster will he\nr.jrefully documented and revirwed.\n131 this manner, the operational proficiency of all systems and individual\ncomponents should be made known.\nMoreover, after a capsule has been\nm.ited with a booster and the mechanic.J and elecwical integration cornpleted, a flight-safety review board\ntrill be held. This review hoard will\n:qort on the over-all expected relialiilitv of the Capsule and booster together. Only after the capsule-booster\nroinbination meets the requirements of\nthe flight-safety review boar<\\ will approval for flight be given.\nAs to tracbng, a total of 17 stations,\nincluding the control center at Cape\nCanaveral, will be active while the\nMercury capsule is in orbit. Of these\nI;. two will be located on-board ship\nin the mid-Atlantic and lndian Oceans.\n.4t each tracking station there \\rill h\ntelcmetry readout giving the personnel\nreal-time indication of the pilot's and\nthe capsule system's condition.

In the U.S.,\n\nMain Recovery Areas Planned for Mercury Capsule\n1\n\nthere are six such tracking installations.\nCertain areas, shown by the chart\nbelow left, have beel; designated as\nprimary recovery areas. A long recovery area. from Cape Canaveral\ntoward the Bermuda Islands, includes\nall impact points in case of an earlv\na b r t . Iletwem the Berrnuda !slands\nand the Canary Islands are othcr primary recovery areas. These areas are\nSO located that if velocity or insertion\nangle is not correct firing of the rctrorockets should cause the capsule to\nimpact in thfm. If the initial orbit is\nnot correct and conditions prevent the\ncapsule from making three orbits, a\nsecond impact area will be aimcd at\ntoward the end of the second orbit.\n'Xhe impact arca from a nominal fiiqht,\nhowever, m n r s at the end of the. t!i!rd\norbit down the Atlantic Missile lbuiqc.\nAs mentioned, this would mean co*itinuous tracking of the capsule tlriririg\nre-entry from Hawaii until impact.\nMile5tones\n\nNQ. 1 4 m p a c t areas possible in an early abort; No. ?--*roes pasible with an impeded am*mPt\n0' orbit; and No. 3-Area\nfor a normal three-abit flight.\n\nThe Astronatit in Project bfcrcrirv\nwill furnish other milestones in man's\nconquest of space.\nThc Xlercric orbital missions \\vi11\npermit thc stwly of the effects of prolonged \\reightlessness on the physiological rextions, the subjective psvchological reactions, and the performance of the .+stronaut.
