b'Additive Manufacturing Infrared Inspection\nNotable Accomplishments\t\n\nDarrell Gaddy/ER43\n(256) 544\xe2\x80\x930198\n\nThe task successfully proved the feasibility of infrared hardware detecting an additive manufacturing process and developed custom software which created 3D\ngeometry files of the additive manufactured part.\n\nMindy Nettles/XP50\n(256) 544\xe2\x80\x931569\n\nSponsoring Program(s)\t\n\nReferences\t\n\nHuman Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate\nSpace Launch System Advanced Development\n\nCrumbly, C.M.; Bickley, F.P.; and Hueter, U.: \xe2\x80\x9cSpace\nLaunch System Spacecraft/Payloads Integration and\nEvolution Office Advanced Development FY\xc2\xa0 2014\nAnnual Report,\xe2\x80\x9d NASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015\xe2\x80\x93218201, NASA\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL,\nJanuary 2015.\n\nProject Description\t\nThe Additive Manufacturing Infrared Inspection Task\nstarted the development of a real-time dimensional\ninspection technique and digital quality record for the\nadditive manufacturing process using infrared camera\nimaging and processing techniques. This project will\nbenefit additive manufacturing by providing real-time\ninspection of internal geometry that is not currently\npossible and reduce the time and cost of additive manufactured parts with automated real-time dimensional\ninspections which deletes post-production inspections.\n\nOrion Delta 3D printer and manufactured part.\n\n29\n\nSLS AD\n\nProject Manager(s)/Lead(s)\t\n\n'
