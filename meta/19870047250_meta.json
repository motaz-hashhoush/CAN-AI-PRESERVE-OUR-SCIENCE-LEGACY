It has been reported by Kui et al. (1984) that the alloy Ni40Pd40P20, which exhibits a scaled glass temperature of about 0.68, has been melt quenched, under a flux of dehydrated B2O3, to a glass at rates as low as 1 deg/s. Here some specimens of this alloy, when similarly fluxed during reheating, have been reheated to temperatures within 50 deg of T1 and 280 deg above Tg at rates of about 2.5 deg/s, and then cooled again to Tg, without crystallization. From this behavior it is inferred that the steady frequency of homogeneous nucleation of crystals in the alloy is less than 0.1/cu cm s.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "47", "submissionId": 19870047250, "issn": "0003-6951", "id": "3a4c8317067a4067b719ff158ae1f3fb", "publicationName": "Applied Physics Letters", "publicationDate": "1985-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
