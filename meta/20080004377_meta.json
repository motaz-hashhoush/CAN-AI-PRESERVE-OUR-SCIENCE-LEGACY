The double face sealing device includes a plurality of sections or segments mounted to one of the surfaces, each having a main body portion, a pair of outwardly extending and diverging, cantilever, spring arms, and a pair of inwardly extending and diverging, cantilever, spring arms, an elastomeric cover on the distal, free, ends of the outwardly extending and diverging spring arms, and an elastomeric cover on the distal, free, ends of the inwardly extending and diverging spring arms. The double face sealing device has application or use in all environments requiring a seal, but is particularly useful to seal openings or hatchways between compartments of spacecraft or aircraft.", "title": "Double face sealing device", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080004377, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Weddendorf, Bruce C."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "eab12c2c58bd4079bb275a0749563a6f"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080004377, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080004377, "id": "0868684ec2034a6e961ac2cca70c5ea8", "publicationDate": "1991-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080004377.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080004377/downloads/20080004377.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080004377/downloads/20080004377.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080004377/downloads/20080004377.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
