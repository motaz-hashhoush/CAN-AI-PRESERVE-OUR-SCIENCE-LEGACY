A two-component system is described, which uses a gas monomer condensible at the soil temperature and a gas phase catalyst acting to polymerize the monomer. A one-component system using a monomer which polymerizes spontaneously on and within the top few millimeters of the soil is also considered. The two-component system employs a simpler apparatus, but it operates over a narrower temperature range (approximately -40 to -10 C). Other two-component systems were identified which may operate at soil temperatures as high as +100 C, at relatively narrow temperature ranges of approximately 30 C. The one-component system was demonstrated to operate successfully with initial soil temperatures from -70 C or lower to +150 C.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720011197, "id": "c3c046adb2b84850afc4c2ce1b4a83fb", "publicationDate": "1972-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19720011197.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19720011197/downloads/19720011197.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19720011197/downloads/19720011197.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19720011197/downloads/19720011197.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
