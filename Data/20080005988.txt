The hold-up power supply provides the flash memory\nwith the power needed to temporarily operate when a power\nloss exists. This allows the flash memory system to complete\nany erasures and writes, and thus allows it to shut down\ngracefully. The hold-up power supply detects when a power\nloss on a power supply bus is occurring and supplies the\npower needed for the flash memory system to temporally\noperate. The hold-up power supply stores power in at least\none capacitor. During normal operation, power from a high\nvoltage supply bus is used to charge the storage capacitors.\nWhen a power supply loss is detected, the power supply bus\nis disconnected from the flash memory system. A hold-up\ncontroller controls the power flow from the storage capacitors to the flash memory system. The hold-up controller uses\nfeedback to assure that the proper voltage is provided from\nthe storage capacitors to the flash memory system. This\npower supplied by the storage capacitors allows the flash\nmemory system to complete any erasures and writes, and\nthus allows the flash memory system to shut down gracefully.\n\n16 Claims, 3 Drawing Sheets\n\n231\n\n23\n\nPOWER SUPPLY BUS\n\nPOWER SUPPLY\nOUTPUT\n\nHOLD-UP SIGNAL\n\nit 200\n\nU S .

This disconnects the power supply bus from\ndiode 204, FETs 205 and 207, comparators 211, 212 and 65 the power supply output, and prevents power supplied by the\n213, capacitors 221, 222, 223 and 224, and resistors 231,\nhold-up power supply 200 from flowing back into the power\nsupply bus.\n232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241 and 242.\n\nUS 6,735,117 B2\n\n6\n\n5\nThe high hold-up signal at the positive input of the\ncomparator 212 causes the output of comparator 212 to float.\nThus, the voltage at the negative input of comparator 213 is\ndetermined by resistors 241, 242 and zener diode 204. The\nzener diode 204 supplies a reference voltage even when the\nPower SUPPlY output has droPPedbelow its normal level. For\nexample, where the Power SUPPlY output is a 5 volt output,\nthe zener diode 204 and resistors 241 and 242\nprovide\n2.5\neven when the power supply Output has dropped\nbelow normal levels. This voltage is used in hold-up power\nsupply 200 as a reference voltage to determine when comparator 213 is turned on. In this embodiment, the value of the\nzener diode 204 was chosen to be 2,5 volts to allow it be\naccurate even when the power supply output is much less\nthan its nominal value of 5 volts. Resistor 242 supplies\nsufficient current to zener diode 204 to cause it to be 2.5\nvolts even when the power supply output has dropped to\nonly 3.5 volts. The ratio of resistors 239 and 240, in\nconjunction with zener diode 204 thus provide a dependable\nreference voltage to comparator 213. This facilitates the\ncomparator 213 Properly determining the Power SUPPlY\noutput voltage during operation in the hold-UP mode. It\nshould be understood that the reference could be provided\nby elements other than the illustrated zener diode 204. For\nexample, it can be provided with precisionintegrated circuit\nvoltage reference such as a LT1009 voltage reference.\nDue to component tolerances, when the power supply bus\nfirst fails, the voltage provided from the power supply bus\nthrough resistors 239 and 240 to the positive input of\ncomparator 213 may be higher or lower than the reference\nvoltage provided by device 204 through resistor 241 to the\nnegative input of comparator 213. However, due to the flash\nmemory system drawing power from the power supply\noutput, the voltage on the power supply output will drop\nbelow the operational voltage. Thus, the voltage at the\nnegative input of comparator 213 begins to exceed the\nvoltage at the positive input of comparator 213. This causes\ncomparator 213 to go to the low state. The voltage at the gate\nof PFET 207 is then determined by the voltage provided\nfrom the high voltage bus through resistor 232 and 235. This\ncauses the PFET 207 to momentarily turn on, allowing\ncurrent to flow from the capacitors 221 and 222 to the power\nsupply output. Thus, the needed voltage to operate the flash\nmemory is provided from capacitors 221 and 222.\nAs the voltage on the power supply output again rises to\noperational levels, the positive input of comparator 213 rises\nand the\noutput again goes open, This turns off\nPFET 207 until the voltage on the power supply output again\ndrops below operational levels. Thus, when the hold-up\nsignal is high, the reference voltage from device 204,\ncomparator 213 and PFET 207 work together using feedback to controllably provide the appropriate voltage at the\npower supply output, Thus, the flash memory systems\npowered by the power supply output can continue to operate\nuntil the power from capacitors 221 and 222 is exhausted,\nThis allows the flash memory to finish writes and erasures,\nallowing a graceful shutdown.\nAgain, it should be noted that many of the elements\nillustrated in hold-up power supply 200 are not necessary\nand could be replaced or supplemented with additional\nelements. For example, resistor 234 is used to insure that\nexcessive current does not flow from capacitors 222 and 221\nduring hold up. This same result could be achieved using an\ninductor of appropriate size. This would have the advantage\nof preventing the current from changing immediately, and\npossibly allow the use of smaller storage capacitors.\nIn some cases the power supply output provided by the\nhold-up power supply 200 will not be at the correct voltage\n\nto operate the flash memory. In these cases, voltage regulators can be provided to convert the power supply output to\nthe correct voltage. Turning now to FIG. 3, a voltage\nregulator 300 is illustrated that receives a power supply\ns input and provides two regulated outputs. The voltage\nregulator 300 uses two three-terminal regulators to provide\nthese regulated outputs. As an example, when supplied with\na five volt power supply input, the voltage regulator 300 can\nbe configured to output two regulated 3.3 volt outputs. This\ni o allows modem flash memory systems that use this voltage to\npower\ninput\' Of course2\nbe powered Off the five\ndifferent applications may require different voltage outputs\nand receive different voltage inputs. Other applications may\nnot require the use Of a\nregu1ator 300 at\n15\nIn the illustrated embodiment, voltage regulator 300 comprises two three terminal regulators, capacitors 301, 302,\n303,304,305 and 306, and resistors 311,312,313, and 314.\nAs an example implementation, the capacitors 301 and 304\ncomprise 0.47 microfarads and the capacitors 302,303,305\n20 and 306 comprise 47 microfarads. In this implementation,\nresistors 311 and 313 comprise 200 ohms, and resistors 312\nand 314 comprise121 ohms,\n\nThe present invention thus provides hold-up power\nply for flash memory systems.
