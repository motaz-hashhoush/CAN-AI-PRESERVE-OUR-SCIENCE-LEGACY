b'Internet-Protocol-Based Satellite Bus\nArchitecture Designed\nNASA is designing future complex satellite missions ranging from single satellites and\nconstellations to space networks and sensor webs. These missions require more\ninteroperability, autonomy, and coordination than previous missions; in addition, a desire\nexists to have scientists retrieve data directly from the satellite rather than a central\ndistribution source. To meet these goals, NASA has been studying the possibility of\nextending the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite for spacebased applications.\n\nGeneric satellite bus architecture.\nFlow diagram showing emergency commands, commands, data, ancillary data, Recorder\nSubnet, spacecraft command system (firewall and router), recorder, altitude control\nsystem subsystem, housekeeping subsystem, additional subsystem, instrument subsystems\n1, 2, and 3, additional subsystems 1 and N, Satellite Status & Maintenance Subnet,\nInstrument Subnet, and additional subnet.\n\nThe objective of this research at the NASA Glenn Research Center was to develop a\ngeneric IP-based satellite bus architecture as shown in the diagram. The onboard\narchitecture includes command and control, housekeeping, and science instruments to take\nmeasurements and data recorders to store the data until download. The bus also provides\n\na standard interface to connect each of these components. The goal was to leverage the\nadvances made in the terrestrial Internet while providing a flexible architecture to meet the\nrequirements of different satellite missions.\nIP can provide a number of benefits for a satellite mission. First, IP can provide end users\nwith simple access to satellite platforms using standard terrestrial Internet tools (e.g.,\ntelnet, ftp, ssh, scp, etc.). Second, IP can permit the integration of heterogeneous\nplatforms by standardizing the communication protocols. These platforms can be\ndeveloped by universities, foreign governments,or private industries. Finally, it can free\nNASA from developing and maintaining the communication infrastructure and allow the\nagency to focus on new missions. NASA will have the flexibility to incorporate research\nby universities, private industries, and other Government agencies.\nUsing terrestrial Internet concepts, the generic bus contains four different subnets, as\nfollows: (1) the Satellite Status & Maintenance Subnet, which contains the command,\ncontrol, and housekeeping instruments; (2) the Instrument Subnet, which contains the\nscience instruments; (3) the Recorder Subnet, which is the central repository for the data\ncollected by the satellite for download; and (4) Additional Subnet(s), which represents one\nor more subnet(s) that are needed to meet specific mission requirements.\nLeveraging terrestrial security concepts, the architecture includes both firewall and a\nrouter. The firewall scrutinizes packets on the basis of rules implemented by the missions\n(e.g., IP addresses or port numbers). The router is responsible for routing data packets to\ntheir correct destination, keeping the satellite and instrument commands on separate\nsubnets. Together, these components function as the interface between the local onboard\nnetwork and the ground. All communications are required to pass through this interface\nbefore reaching any module on the satellite. If additional security is required, the mission\ncan implement a Virtual Private Network between the ground and satellite.\nAlthough this study focused on the satellite bus architecture, it, along with other NASA\nresearch, shows that true IP connectivity from the ground station to the satellite is a\npossibility. However, a detailed design is needed for the bus architecture to ensure that\neach component can be easily and seamlessly integrated. Then, the design must be applied\nto more complex missions that are coming on the horizon.\nFind out more about this research: http://ctd.grc.nasa.gov/5610/5610.html\nGlenn contact: Rich Slywczak, 216-433-3493, Richard.A.Slywczak@nasa.gov\nAuthor: Richard A.
