The algorithm uses a constraint: to find the footpoint on the surface\nLhat is "closest" to the actual. pixel.. The closest is in geometrical terms and\nunder certain conditions the footpoint is near, but not the actual closest point.\nThese conditions will only allow determination of the closest point in an\n,\ninvolved manner, which is not: considered to be justified. \t\nThe separation of the pixel from this footpoint can then be tested against\nstatistical or geometric thresholds to determine whether the pixel can be classed\nas belonging, or not belonging co the vecLor surface.\nTI, procedure dctermfnes the proportions of the vnriuus nodes represented\nin the pixel, so Lhal: those pixels classified as belonging to t:he vecLor can be\nsub-classified according to their proportions of the various surface types.\nThe derivation is based on independant types of surface cover similar to\nthose used by Horwitz and Nal.eplca in Lhei.r article "Estimating the proportions\nof objects within a single resolution element: of a multispeclral. scanner",\npresented at the 7th Symposium in this series.

The footpoint response values are then determined\nby substituting the proportion values into equation 4.\nOften the footpoint will fall outside of the domain of the nodes, in which\ncase one or more propor^ions will. be negative. One or more may be positive.\nThe author decided to restrict the footpoint to within the domain of the nodes.\nThis is done by making all negative proportions zero and dividing all new\nproportions by the sum of the new proportions, This approach has advantages\nand disadvantages, which will be discussed, the author believing that the advantages\noutweigh the disadvantages.\nIf the covariance arrays for the nodes are given as COV I , COVz i ...COVn, then\nit can be shown, by the law of propagation of error, that:\nz\t\nz\nCOV (I,J) = a 2 COV I (I,J) + az COVz (I, J) +...+ a n COVn (I,J)\nfor all (I l i). This I gives the covariance array of the selected footpoint, so\nthat the likelihood of the actual pixel belonging to the vector can be tested\nstatistically, in a variety of ways,\nThe statistical envelope defined in this way are parabolic surfaces on\neither side of the vector. surface. The author believes that in many cases it\nis not convenient to either determine or estimate the covariance arrays and\nbelieves that testing the geometric distance between pixel and footpoint will\nnot introduce significant errors, for a saving in classification time.\nENVIROMENTAL SUPPORT FOR CLASSIFIER\n\nr\n\nl;\n\nThe turbid lakes of Western Victoria display linear relationships between\nthe response bands through the series of lakes sampled. The response values\nare related to turbidity levels, although not necessarily in a linear manner.\nProfiles across a large swamp lagoon, Bool Lagoon, give a .linear relationship\nbetween the bands, from water surfaces through to the dry reed beds.\nRESULTS ACHIEVED\n\nThe classifier had been n--ad \'in two studies, Bool Lagoon and classifying\nthe Sand Dunes front\n\t scrub near Lake Bonney on the South Australian Coast.\nBoth exercises were successfull and will be reported in more detail at the\nsymposium. The Boot Lagoon work was done at three dates, 29th November, 1972,\n30th December, 1975 and 16th January, 1976.\n\n'
