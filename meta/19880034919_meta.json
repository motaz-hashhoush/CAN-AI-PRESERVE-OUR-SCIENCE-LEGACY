In cases where the threat is overestimated, in either space or time, an opportunity cost is accrued. This paper describes a small thunderstorm initiated over the KSC by terrain effects, that serves to exemplify the impact such an event may have on ground operations at the Center. Data from the Air Force Lightning Location and Protection System, the AF/NASA Launch Pad Lightning Warning System field mill network, radar, and satellite imagery are used to describe the thunderstorm and to discuss its impact.", "title": "Lightning threat extent of a small thunderstorm", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T14:35:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880034919, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nicholson, James R."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Kennedy Space Center", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "dce86566db7e4669b021b22782e213b2"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880034919, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Maier, Launa M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Kennedy Space Center; Computer Sciences Corp.", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "ccf139f81ba242c0928c6425afe8ef71"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19880034919, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Weems, John"}, "organization": {"name": "USAF, Cape Canaveral Forecast Facility, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station", "location": "FL, United States"}}, "id": "b09c25a9bfad41a193a6eb58474121c2"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880034919, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880034919, "id": "f757c1adddfa4ba58e78c96c36ac5ca7", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
