Conventional peak detectors do not retain\nall of the frequency information in these signals.\nThe s'olution:\n\nA solid state circuit that selects the highest of several (six shown in block diagram) ac accelerometer\n\nsignals and gates this signal to an output amplifier,\npreserving all the frequency information in the peak\nsignal. If the amplitudes of the accelerometer signals\nchange with time, the circuit will continually switch\nto the highest signal, rejecting the smaller signals.\nHow it's done:\n\nThe ac accelerometer signals, direct coupled to dc\ninput amplifiers, are amplified and then rectified to\nproduce dc voltages proportional to the accelerometer\ninput signals. These dc voltages are coupled to a\nlogic or circuit, which controls the gate.

The signal from\nthis amplifier is fed to a standard servo system which\ncontrols the vibration levels applied to the accelerometers mounted on the test structure.\nNotes:\n\n1. Several multichannel selectors can be connected\nin such a manner that the output from each additional selector is fed into any one of the channels\nof the next selector. The output amplifiers would\nbe set for unity gain.\n\nBrief 66-10462\t\n\n2.
