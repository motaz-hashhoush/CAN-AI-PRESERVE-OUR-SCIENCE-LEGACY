For simplicity,\nthe following paragraphs refer only to AEC regulations. Contact the Environmental Health Contractor for appl icable state regulations.\n\n3.2\n\nAREA DESIGNATIONS\nThe following area designations shall apply for purposes of radiation control at\nKSC:\na.\n\n,\n\nControlled Area\nAny area to which access i s control led for purposes of protection of individuals from exposure to radiation and radioactive material. The term "control led" is meant to be synonymous with the term, "restricted" as used i n\nthe AEC Regulations.\n\nb.\n\nRadiation Area\nAny area, accessible to personnel , i n which there exists radiation at such\nlevels that a major portion of the body could receive in any one hour a dose\nin excess of 5 millirem, or in any 5 consecutive days a dose i n excess of\n100 millirem.\n\nc.\n\nHigh Radiation Area\nAny area, accessible to personnel, i n which there exists radiation at such\nlevels that a major portion of the body could receive, in any one hour, a\ndose in excess of 100 millirem.\n\nd\n\n.\n\nAirborne Radioactivity Area\nAny room, enclosure, or operating area i n which airborne radioactive\nmaterials exist i n concentrations in excess of the amounts specified i n\nTitle 10, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Part 20, Appendix B, Table I, Column 1 or any room,\n;\nenclosure, or area in which concentrations, which averaged over the\n\nnumber of hours in any week during which individuals are i n the area,\nexceed 25 percent of the amounts specified in Title 10, CFR 20,\nAppendix B, Table I, Column 1.\ne\n\n.\n\nUncontroll.ed Area\nAny area to which access i s not controlled for purposes of protection of\nindividuals from exposure to radiation and radioactive materials. The\nterm lluncontrolled" is meant to be synonymous with the term llunrestricted\'l\nas used i n the AEC Regulations.\n\nRADIATION DOSE LIMITS\nRadiation dose limits at KSC are based upon limits specified by the AEC in\n10 CFR 2 0 . It should be recognized that the KSC limits are established as\nmaximum values and, in a l l cases, personnel exposure should be maintained at\nthe lowest practical level.\na.\n\nDose Limits for Controlled Areas\nPersonnel shall not be exposed routinely to radiation or radioactive\nmaterial i n such a manner that the following limits are exceeded:\nRem/Calendar\nQuarter\nWhole body; head and trunk;\nactive blood forming organs;\nlens of eyes; or gonads.\n\n....................\n\nHands and forearms; feet\nand ankles\n\n.............................\nSkin of whole body .......................\n\n1.25\n\n18.75\n7.50\n\nIn exceptional cases an individual may be permitted to receive a quarterly,\nwhole body dose greater than 1.25 rem provided:\n(1)\n\nDuring any calendar quarter the dose to the whole body shall not\nexceed 3 rem; and\n\n(2)\n\nThe dose to the whole body, when added to the accumulated\noccupational dose to the whole body, shall not exceed 5 (N-18)\nrem where N equals the individual\'s age i n years at his last birthday, and\n\n(3)\n\nThe individual\'s prior accumulated exposure has been determined.\n\nDose Limits for Minors\nAn individual under the age of 18 years shall not be permitted to enter or\nbe employed in controlled areas such that he w i l l receive doses of radiation i n amounts exceeding 10 percent of the limits i n para. 3.3, a.\nExposures shall be averaged over periods not to exceed one calendar\nquarter.\nDose Limits i n Uncontrolled Areas\nRadiation dose limits in uncontrol\'led areas shall be such that an individual\nw i l l not receive a dose to the whole body i n excess of 0.5 rem i n any\ncalendar year. Furthermore, radiation levels shall be such that i f an\nindividual was continuously present i n the area, he would not receive a\ndose i n excess of 100 millirem in any seven days.\n\n3.4\n\nAIRBORNE CONCENTRATION LIMITS\nAirborne concentrations of radioactive materials to which personnel at KS C may\nbe exposed are also based upon limits specified by the AEC in Title 10 CFR 20.\nAgain, the KSC limits are established as maximum values, and in all cases airborne concentrations should be maintained at the lowest practical level. Special\nauthorization by the KSC-RPO is required for work which may create airborne\nconcentrations of radioactive material. such operations w i l l require the presence\nof the Environmental Health Contractor.\na.\n\nControl led Areas\nWith no allowance made for protective clothing or equipment, no personnel\ns ha1l be exposed to airborne radioactive material in average concentrations\ni n excess of the limits specified i n Title 10 CFR 20, Appendix 9,\nTable 1. These limits are based upon an exposure to these concentrations\nfor forty hours in any period of seven consecutive days. For exposure\ntimes, other than forty hours, the airborne concentration limits may be\nincreased or decreased proportionately.\n\nb.\n\nMinors\nAn individual under the age of 1 8 years shall not be exposed to airborne\nradioactive material i n an average concentration in excess of the limits\nspecified i n Title 10 CFR 2 0 , Appendix 9, Table 2. Concentrations\nmay be averaged over periods not greater than one week.\n\nc\n\n.\n\nUncontrol led Areas\nNo personnel i n uncontrolled areas shall be exposed to airborne radioactive\nmaterial i n concentrations i n excess of the limits specified i n Title 10\nCFR 20, Appendix B, Table 2. Concentrations may be averaged over a\nperiod not greater than one year.\n\n3.5\n\nPERSONNEL MONITORING\na.\n\nPersonnel monitoring i s required in any area where there i s a probability\nthat an individual may receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 percent\nof the limits i n Section 111, para. 3.3, a.\n\nb.\n\nThe details of the monitoring procedure shall be determined i n each case\nby the Environmental Health Contractor i n consultation with the Radiation\nUse Supervisor and with consideration of the KSC dose limits (Section Ill,\npara. 3.3).\n\nc.\n\nPersonnel monitoring procedures shall include, as a minimum, the wearirig\nof film badges and/or pocket dosimeters. Film badges shall be changed\nfor processing on or about the first working day of each month or as otherwise determined by the RPO or his designated alternate.

Radioactive materials\ncan be spread very rapidly and easily by the air currents set up by a fire. They\nmay also find their way into an air-conditioning system, or, i f spilled on the\nfloor, they may be tracked around by personnel. This contamination is undetectable except by the use of specific radiation-detecting devices. Since it is\nextremely difficult to set up adequate detection controls i n an emergency, preplanned emergency procedures are included in this handbook. Personnel whose\nwork involves the use of radioactive materials shall familiarize themselves with\nthese procedures.\n\n4.2\n\nPROCEDURES AFTER SPILLAGE OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL\na.\n\nGeneral R e s ~ o n s i b i l i t i e s\nImmediately after the occurrence of a spill, the involved person must\nvacate all.affected personnel to a safe area. He w i l l then notify by telephone, or by the most rapid method of communication, the KSC-R PO and\nfollow his instructions or those of his authorized representative.\n\nb.\n\nSpecific Precautions\nUnless he has received different instructions from the KSC-RPO, the\nperson involved i n the spillage shall proceed to:\n\n(1)\n\nPrevent a l l affected personnel from approaching the contaminated\narea, or from attempting to deal with the spillage.\n\n(2)\n\nClose a l l windows and other openings such as ventilating grills.\n\n(3)\n\nClose and lock a l l doors.\n\n(4)\n\nIf the spillage involves powdered or gaseous radioactive material,\nseal a l l doors and other openings after closing. Suitable sealing\nmaterials usually handy are wide masking tape, adhesive tape, or\nheavy wrapping paper, secured to the frames.\n\n.\n\nc.\n\nRules Affecting Conduct of all Personnel\n\n(1)\n\'\n\nNo person shall enter the affected area until the KSC-RPO or his\ndesignated alternate has conducted a contamination survey and has\npronounced the area safe to resume work.\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nDe.contamination procedures shal l ALWAYS be conducted under\nthe supervision of the KSC-RPO or his designated alternate.\n\n(4)\n\n4.3\n\nUnauthorized personnel shall not attempt to make a survey, or to\nclean up the spillage. Under special circumstances, personnel\nauthorized by the KSC-RPO shall direct and closely supervise\nthese tasks.\n\nPersonnel shall be instructed to keep their movements i n the contaminated area to a minimum to avoid spreading the contaminant\nby tracking.\n\nFIRES IN RADIATION AREAS\nIn case of fire i n areas where radioactive materials are in use, every practical\neffort should be made by the user to replace the material i n i t s shielded container.\nIn any event, it is the responsibility of the user to prompt1y notify the Fire\nDepartment and the KS C-RPO.\nFire Department personnel w i l l be knowledgeable of radiation hazards, and the\nFire Department i s encouraged to contact the Environmental Health Contractor\nfor periodic instruction. The Fire Department shall be kept notified by the\nEnvironmental Health Contractor of a l l locations of radioactive materials in\namounts that may prove hazardous to Fire Department personnel either externally\nor internally or that may present a serious contamination problem. Upon call to\none of these locations, the Fire Chief, in consultation with the Environmental\nHealth Contractor, shall be responsible to see that proper procedures are implemented to minimize radiation exposure to personnel and spread of contamination.\n\n4.4\n\nLOST OR MISPLACED SOURCES OF RADIATION\nLost or misplaced sources of radiation should be reported immediately to the\nKSC-RPO.\nThe KSC-RPO shall report immediately to the AEC after a theft or loss of\nlicensed material.\n\n4.5\n\nNOTIFICATION O F ACCIDENTS\na.\n\nRadiation users w i l l report to the KSC-RPO immediately any incident or\naccident involving radiation sources or malfunction of radiation producing\nequipment. The KSC-RPO will promptly investigate any such report and\nadvise NASA management of his findings.\n\nb.\n\nThe KSC-RPO w i l l notify the AEC immediately following an accident as\ndescribed i n Title 10 CFR 2 0 , para. 2 0 . 4 0 3 .\n\nc.\n\nThe KSC-RPO shall submit a written report within 30 days following an\noverexposure to radiation levels of radiation and concentrations of radioactive material as described i n Title 10 CFR 20, para. 2 0 . 4 0 5 .\n\nSECTION V\nLAUNCH OPERATIONS WITH RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS\n\n5.1\n\nGENERAL\nRadioactive material w i l l be used in launched spacecraft when authorized by\nNASA Headquarters which assumes responsibility for coordination with other\nagencies to assure compatibility of the proposed use with national policies and\nobjectives.\n\n5.2\n\nACTIVITIES\na.\n\nPrelaunch\nActivities involving sealed radioactive flight sources shall conform to the\nprovision of this handbook i n addition to the applicable license conditions.\n\nb.\n\nLaunch\n\n(1)\n\nManned Flights\nUpon launch ,.
