Ka-band MMIC arrays have long been considered as having high potential for increasing the capability of space, aircraft, and land mobile communication systems in terms of scan performance, data rate, link margin, and flexibility while offering a significant reduction in size, weight, and power consumption. Insertion of MMIC technology into antenna systems, particularly at millimeter wave frequencies using low power and low noise amplifiers in close proximity to the radiating elements, offers a significant improvement in the array transmit efficiency, receive system noise figure, and overall array reliability. Application of active array technology also leads to the use of advanced beamforming techniques that can improve beam agility, diversity, and adaptivity to complex signal environments.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960003029, "id": "155e73126bb34b34bef364dcf6f9cbde", "publicationDate": "1995-06-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960003029.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960003029/downloads/19960003029.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960003029/downloads/19960003029.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960003029/downloads/19960003029.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
