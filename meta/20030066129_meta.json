The Space Shuttle Vehicle utilizes two SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters) to assist during the launch sequence and achieve the predefined orbit and mission objectives. A critical feature of this program involves post- flight SRB retrieval, disassembly and reuse of case structural components to manufacture future RSRM motors. To ensure these components can be safely reused, inspection criteria based on dimensional, structural and fracture requirements, has been established in the form of Engineering specifications and drawings. These criteria originated from actual hardware testing (both subscale and full scale) coupled with conventional Engineering hand calculations and computerized Finite Element Analyses (FEA). The intent of this paper is to provide an overview of the RSRM Case component refurbishment requirements and the associated case hardware inspection and evaluation processes that has been established to satisfy these requirements. Many of these processes have been recently upgraded to comply with environmental regulations, obsolescence concerns and technological advancements. Qualification of these process changes has been closely monitored and documented through test plans and reports.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030066129, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "4afc70635f5241559dbdb9f5c239e97c", "id": "72d2536554dc4c0ea717a0472bd6e284"}], "name": "AIAA 2003 Joint Propulsion Conference", "location": "Huntsville, AL", "id": "4afc70635f5241559dbdb9f5c239e97c", "startDate": "2003-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030066129, "id": "f801165ba29d472982b3fd6f19726832", "publicationDate": "2003-04-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030066129.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030066129/downloads/20030066129.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030066129/downloads/20030066129.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030066129/downloads/20030066129.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
