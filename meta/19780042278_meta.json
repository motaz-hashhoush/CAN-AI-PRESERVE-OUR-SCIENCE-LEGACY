The data is stored in key ordered format for retrieval but is not input in key order. Existing access methods for large data bases with rapid data replacement by keys become inefficient as the volume of data being replaced grows. The Round-Robin method was developed to alleviate this problem. The Round-Robin access method allows rapid updating of the data with continuous self cleaning where the oldest data (by key) is deleted and the newest data (by key) is kept regardless of the order of input.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19780042278, "endDate": "1977-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Data Management Symposium", "location": "Huntsville, AL", "id": "5d3ae059e55d4aa79221ab183b8360d0", "startDate": "1977-10-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780042278, "id": "429f6d719ca44b8893fbb570f543c10c", "publicationDate": "1978-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
