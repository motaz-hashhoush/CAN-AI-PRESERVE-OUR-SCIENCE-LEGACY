The Agency is shifting from an exploration-based program with human\nactivities in low Earth orbit (LEO) and targeted robotic missions in deep space to a more sustainable and integrated pioneering\napproach. However, pioneering space involves daunting technical challenges of transportation, maintaining health, and\nenabling crew productivity for long durations in remote, hostile, and alien environments. Subject matter experts from\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) are currently studying a human exploration\ncampaign that involves deployment of assets for planetary exploration. This study, called the Evolvable Mars Campaign\n(EMC) study, explores options with solar electric propulsion as a central component of the transportation architecture. This\nparticular in-space transportation option often results in long duration transit to destinations. The EMC study is also\ninvestigating deployed human rated systems like landers, habitats, rovers, power systems and ISRU system to the surface of\nMars, which also will involve long dormant periods when these systems are staged on the surface. In order to enable the\nEMC architecture, campaign and element design leads along with system and capability development experts from HEOMD\xe2\x80\x99s\nSystem Maturation Team (SMT) have identified additional capabilities, systems and operation modes that will sustain these\nsystems especially during these dormant phases of the mission. Dormancy is defined by the absence of crew and relative\ninactivity of the systems. For EMC missions, dormant periods could range from several months to several years. Two aspects\nof uncrewed dormant operations are considered herein: (1) the vehicle systems that are placed in a dormant state and (2) the\nautonomous vehicle systems and robotic capabilities that monitor, maintain, and repair the vehicle and systems. This paper\ndescribes the mission stages of dormancy operations, phases of dormant operations, and critical system capabilities that are\nneeded for dormant operations. This paper will compare dormancy operations of past robotic missions to identify lessons\nthat can be applied to planned human exploration missions. Finally, this paper will also identify future work and analysis\nplanned to assess system performance metrics and integrated system operations.\n\npg. 1\n\nBACKGROUND\nJourney to Mars\nNASA is on a Journey to Mars (J2M), seeking to expand\nhuman presence into the solar system in a sustainable way.\nThis strategy implements the policies outlined in the 2010\nNASA Authorization Act and U.S. National Space Policy.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s goal is not just to reach a destination, but rather\nit is to develop the capacity for people to work and learn\nand operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended\nperiods of time, ultimately in ways that are more\nsustainable and even indefinite. And in fulfilling this task,\nwe will not only extend humanity\xe2\x80\x99s reach in space -- we\nwill strengthen America\xe2\x80\x99s leadership here on Earth. To\nrealize this goal, NASA is actively developing the\ncapabilities that will enable humans to thrive beyond\nEarth for extended periods of time, leading to a\nsustainable presence in space. Investments in initial\ncapabilities will be continuously leveraged and reused on\nthe journey to Mars, enabling more complex operations\nover time. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s approach to pioneering is designed\naround a set of key strategic principles that will increase\nsuccesses and rewards over the coming decades. These\nkey principles for a sustainable, affordable space program\nprovide overarching guidance to help ensure NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\ninvestments efficiently and effectively achieve the\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s goals.\nAs part of NASA\xe2\x80\x98s continuing efforts in space\nexploration, the agency regularly seeks to improve upon\npotential approaches for sending humans into deep space.\nThe Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC) builds on the\nresults of other previous NASA studies focused on human\nexploration beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO), but instead of\na point solution, the EMC employs a conceptual design\nphilosophy that focuses on iterative trade analyses that\nembrace previous and parallel studies as well as new\ncapabilities\nand\ntechnologies,\nnew\nscientific\nunderstanding, and all interested and viable partnerships.\nThe EMC trade studies are working toward a more\noptimal set of systems. The range and diversity of the\ntrades are key and customer focused. The EMC was\ndeveloped with an emphasis on programmatic flexibility,\nlimiting unique capability development as much as\npossible, emphasizing modularity, progressively building\nto Mars surface missions, and slowing the cadence of\nmissions to maintain affordability. The EMC represents a\nfundamental philosophy change to enable sustained\nhuman deep space exploration and results in a long-\n\nduration presence on Mars, rather than optimizing for\nspecific consecutive missions.\nThe EMC study is an ongoing series of architectural trade\nanalyses that defines the capabilities and elements needed\nfor a sustainable human presence on the surface of Mars.\nThe Human Exploration and Operations Mission\nDirectorate (HEOMD) leads the analysis, with subject\nmatter expert participation across nine NASA centers and\nclose coordination with other architectural analysis groups\nwithin the following organizations, the Science and Space\nTechnology Mission Directorates and the Offices of the\nChief Scientist and the Chief Technologist. The EMC\nidentifies a set of operational capabilities and architectural\ntrades required to sustainably expand human presence\nfrom LEO into deep space. The capability-driven EMC\nintegrates science missions, robotic precursors, system\nmaturation and risk reduction pathfinders, and a\nsustainable cadence of cargo and crewed missions that\nlead to an extended human presence on the surface of\nMars. Several scenarios have been considered for a\nhuman mission to the Martian surface. Of these, only one\nspans all Mars vicinity destinations. The \xe2\x80\x9cMars vicinity\nand Phobos, followed by a mission to Mars surface\xe2\x80\x9d\nscenario represents an ambitious campaign that leverages\nmost of the capabilities and potential tradeoffs described\nin the EMC. This particular campaign acts as a point of\ncomparison for future trade assessments and serves as the\nbaseline reference campaign for the EMC. This baseline\nreference scenario is then used to evaluate capabilities,\nschedules, risks, challenges, and mitigation strategies.\nEMC DORMANCY OPERATIONS\nThe EMC has defined several periods during the mission\ncampaign when assets will be deployed to the Mars\nsurface. There will be long periods of time between\ndeployment of the assets and use when the astronauts\narrive on the surface. Once the astronauts leave the\nsurface of Mars, there will be additional long periods of\ntime when assets will be in dormant stages then as well.\nIt is critically important for the EMC to design elements\nand systems that will be monitored, repaired and survive\nduring these dormant phases. Deployment of assets for\nhuman planetary exploration (e.g., a habitat on a planetary\nsurface, a propellant module in orbit) may necessitate the\nmaintenance of those assets in a dormant state for a period\nof time during transit, after deployment, and prior to\narrival of the mission crews in order to preserve vehicle\nsystems and associated consumables. The dormant period\ncould range from several months to several years. Two\naspects of uncrewed dormant operations are considered\n\npg. 2\n\nherein: (1) the vehicle systems that are placed in a dormant\nstate and (2) the autonomous vehicle systems and robotic\ncapabilities that monitor, maintain, and repair the vehicle\nand systems.\nDormancy is addressed by the mission stage:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 During aggregation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 During transit to destination\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In orbit at destination, including:\no Elements in orbit prior to deployment to\nsurface or use by crew\no Transit habitat while crew is on the\nsurface\n\xe2\x80\xa2 On the surface of destination\n\xe2\x80\xa2 During transit in the return to Earth/Cis-Lunar\nvicinity\nDormancy operation needs also may change between\nperiods of crew residency: (1) during the deployment\nphase, prior to crew arrival, or (2) between occupied\nphases, following departure of a crew and in preparation\nfor arrival of the next crew. Each of these phases has\nunique requirements for establishing a dormant state and\nawakening from that state. See Figure 1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFigure 1. Dormancy Scope\n\nCrewed elements (e.g., initial cis-lunar\nhabitation, transit habitation, Phobos surface\nhabitat, Mars surface habitat, pressurized rovers)\n\xe2\x80\x93 dormant during transit and after deployment\n(active following deployment for functional\ntesting) and partially dormant between crew\nvisits.\nLanders \xe2\x80\x93 descent stage landers are dormant\nduring cruise, and after landing will supply their\ncargo (e.g., surface habitat) with the necessary\nresources, such as power to maintain a dormant\nstate until the landers can be attached to the\nsurface power source; landers with an ascent\nstage are dormant during cruise, while in orbit,\nand after deployment on the surface until needed\nby a crew for ascent to orbit. Onboard power and\nthermal systems are active for cryogenic fluid\nmanagement to negate boil off of methane\npropellant. Once surface power is connected insitu resource utilization (ISRU) systems can be\nactivated for liquid oxygen (LOX) production.\nSupport systems (ISRU unit, kilo-power unit,\ncommunications) \xe2\x80\x93 dormant during cruise but\nactive on the surface after deployment, however,\nISRU may have periods of dormancy between\ncrew visits. ISRU remains onboard the descent\nstage to produce the LOX for the Mars ascent\nvehicle (MAV).\nThe cryogenic fluid\nmanagement (CFM) system goes with the MAV.\nPayloads (science instruments, prototype\nequipment such as ISRU) \xe2\x80\x93 dormant during\ncruise but active in orbit or on the surface after\ndeployment. Some instruments require crew for\noperation, which may involve long dormant\nperiods.\n\nAs stated previously, dormant periods could range from\nseveral months to several years.

Since crew is not present, these mission\noperations activities must be performed remotely,\nautonomously, or robotically.\nMission operations\nincludes:\n1.\n\n2.\n\nSystem monitoring. The sensing technologies\nneeded for monitoring critical systems and the\nenvironment (e.g., toxicity levels, pressurization\nfor habitable modules; fluid state for tanks) to\ndetermine the vehicle operational condition and\ndetermine if timeline is being respected (see\nbelow). A critical aspect of this capability is\ndetermining how much and what data should be\nsent to the ground for analysis.\nExecute timeline. Dormant operations will still\nrequire planning and performing activities, both\nduring cruise and at the destination. Classes of\nactivities on the timeline include:\n\n3.\n\nManeuvers - Orbit and trajectory\nmanagement,\nsurface\noperations,\nperhaps rendezvous and docking.\nThese activities are needed for thermal\ncontrol, power management, and\nenabling communications.\nb. Logistics - Site preparation, resource\nproduction control and transport.\nc. Maintenance - Conducting periodic\nservicing operations to keep a system at\na certain state of functionality during\ndormancy which will allow it to become\nfully operational when needed.\nd. Repair - Replacing failing or failed\ncomponents\nor\nto\nrestore\nmalfunctioning systems will be needed\nto keep the vehicle in operational\nreadiness.\nThe execution of the timeline can be distributed\nbetween vehicle system automation, robotic\nsystems, and ground. This distribution will\nrequire analysis of tasks to determine suitability,\nanalysis of robotic system and computational\nresources, etc.\nOperational or occupancy preparations /\ndeparture preparations. Preparing systems for\nthe dormant period post-departure by performing\noperations such as: stowing of equipment,\nflushing & purging fluid systems, and powering\ndown systems to be maintained on keep alive\npower. Similarly, preparing the system for\noccupancy by bringing the cabin environment to\na habitable temperature and air mix.\n\nPAST ROBOTIC MISSIONS UTILIZING DORMANT\nOPERATIONS\nExisting capabilities for dormant operations are primarily\nthose employed by robotic planetary spacecraft such as\nNew Horizons, Rosetta, and Dawn, from which valuable\nlessons can be applied to crewed vehicles since minimal\nexperience exists in their dormant operation. Dormancy\noperation is common in long-duration robotic missions.\nFor these types of missions, typically dormant operations\nmay involve thrusters and associated plumbing being\nturned off until they are used, e.g., post-cruise,\ninstruments are turned off until they are used. Other\nexamples of this type of operation include dormancy\nemployed for short durations during the Skylab program\nand an assessment of a \xe2\x80\x9cdecrewed\xe2\x80\x9d mode for the ISS. The\nfollowing sections provide brief overviews of these\ncapabilities. New or different capabilities are needed for\n\npg. 4\n\nhuman missions. Human missions use systems that are\ncomplex, which means sensors with increased\nperformance may be used. Human mission systems are\nmuch larger than robotic systems and there are human\nsystems like ECLSS that most robotic spacecraft don\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave or need.\nHuman Spaceflight Missions\n\xef\x82\xb7 Skylab - America\xe2\x80\x99s first space station was placed\nin a dormant state for several weeks between the\nSkylab 2 and 3 missions and between the Skylab\n3 and 4 missions as well as following Skylab 4,\nwhich was the final crew visit to the station. A\nnumber of general lessons can be gained from the\nSkylab experiences. For example, while one\nflight controller described activation of the\nvehicle following a dormant state between crew\nvisits as "only a little more complicated than\nwhen you come back from vacation," the crews\nfound the job considerably more involved.\nEvery job took more time than anticipated and a\nnumber of mistakes also slowed the activation.\nFor example, an hour was lost when one of the\ncrew on Skylab 4 left a valve in the wrong\nposition while flushing the potable water system\nwith iodine solution prior to opening a new water\ntank, and dumped the disinfectant into the waste\ntank. Frequent communications from Mission\nControl also caused interruptions that slowed\noperations during activation. Shutting down the\nvehicle and packing equipment to be returned\nalso was a large job. Prior to the end of the\nSkylab 4 mission, Mission Control transmitted a\nlist of changes to the deactivation and reentry\nchecklists, which amounted to 15 meters of\nteleprinter paper being generated onboard\nSkylab.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nInternational Space Station (ISS) \xe2\x80\x93 ISS operated\nin a dormant/unscrewed mode for a year before\nthe first crew arrived in November of 2000. Prior\nto this, ISS buildup flights took place from 1998\nand 1999. While the ISS has not been placed in\na dormant state during its operational lifetime, an\nassessment was conducted to define the\ncapabilities needed to prepare the ISS in the\nevent it would need to be \xe2\x80\x9cdecrewed\xe2\x80\x9d and placed\nin an autonomous/dormant mode. The following\ndesired capabilities were defined by the\nassessment.\nPreventative\nor\ncorrective\nmaintenance must be performed to address\nsystem degradation. Critical systems were\n\nidentified that needed to be redundant. For\ninstance one half of critical loads in the U.S. Lab\nand Node 3 would have a jumper to a redundant\ncooling loop to prevent complete loss in the event\nof cooling loop leak. Maintaining visiting\nvehicle dock/undock and ground control and\nrobotic capability was identified. In order to\nprevent loss of science it was determined that the\nISS office and payload community had to work\ntogether to identify required activities to prevent\nloss of science. One other aspect of this\nassessment included atmosphere management\npressure, temperature and humidity.\nThe\nassessment showed the need to continue intraand inter- module ventilation, in order to\nmaintain U.S. orbital segment (USOS)\natmosphere within temperature and humidity\nlimits, was critical for the \xe2\x80\x9cdecrewed\xe2\x80\x9d mode.\nMaintaining atmosphere management is critical\nfor any human exploration mission that will\nundergo a dormant period.\nAtmosphere\nmanagement is a critical capability for Mars\nsurface systems especially deployed habitats and\npressurized rovers.\nIn order to minimize\ninterruptions to services, maintenance and\nupgrades made prior to decrewed operation were\nalso identified as critical capabilities.\nAdditionally, capabilities, such as a wireless leak\ndetection system currently being tested on ISS that can\nquickly detect and localize leaks based on ultrasonic\nsensor array signals, potentially could be employed during\ndormant EMC operations.\nBefore viewing the critical systems and capabilities\nneeded for dormancy operations, this next section will\ndescribe notional Mars surface operations. The Human\nSpaceflight Architecture Team (HAT) Mars Destination\nOperations team developed this notional mission.\nInformation in this section will detail the specific\noperations needed including dormancy operations and\nwill assist with linking operations with needed critical\nsystems and capabilities identified in the next section.\nNOTIONAL SURFACE MISSION CONCEPT OF\nOPERATIONS\nA notional end-to-end Mars mission was defined in a 2013\nstudy (HAT Mars Destination Operations Team FY2013\nFinal Report, 7 Nov 2013), which included six mission\nphases to help define the operations functions and\ncapabilities needed for surface systems:\n\npg. 5\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPhase 0 \xe2\x80\x93 Prior to Cargo Landing\nPhase 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Post Cargo Landing (~2-4 Years)\nPhase 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Crew Landing & Acclimation (~730 Sols)\nPhase 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Local Exploration (~30 Sols)\nPhase 4 \xe2\x80\x93 Regional Exploration ( ~230-410\nSols)\nPhase 5 \xe2\x80\x93 Preparation for Ascent (~30 Sols)\nPhase 6 \xe2\x80\x93 Post Crew Departure\n\nAn overview of the mission is presented here, highlighting\nspecific aspects related to dormancy. During the in-space\ntransportation phases, there is an extended period of time\n(~3 years for the DRA 5.0 case up to ~7 years for the EMC\ncases) between the launch of surface system assets until\nall of these assets are put into use after the crew arrives.\nTypically, the first lander in all examples will carry the\nfission surface power system (FSPS) and a deployment\nsystem to off-load and move the components of this\nsystem to its operational location \xe2\x80\x93 approximately 1000\nmeters from the lander. This will be an activity that occurs\nat the beginning of Phase 1. The crew\xe2\x80\x99s MAV will land\nwith the FSPS or on the second lander and must be\nconnected to the FSPS in order for ISRU system to begin\nmaking LOX for ascent. One or two small robotic rovers\nwill be part of the cargo delivered during Phase 1 and will\nbe operated by personnel on Earth throughout the\nremainder of Phase 1. Surface assets other than the FSPS,\nISRU plant, and small surface rovers will remain dormant\nuntil the end of Phase 1. The first cargo lander for the\nsecond (and subsequent) crew will carry the MAV and a\nfresh ISRU plant. This ISRU plant must be connected to\nthe FSPS. Note that in all of these examples this cargo\nlander will arrive while the first crew is still on the surface\nand that crew will insure that the power system is\nconnected (this is likely to be the case for all subsequent\ncrews although not all trajectory opportunities have been\nexamined to substantiate this). All other landers (and the\nsurface assets they carry) will remain dormant until the\narrival of the next crew.\nIn all examples there is a period of time, ranging in\nduration from about 8-9 months for the Mars DRA 5.0\nstudy case to about 3-4 years for the EMC cases, when no\ncrew will be present. During this time, the MAV for the\nnext crew will be actively making LOX, which implies\nthat the FSPS and ISRU plant will be fully active. Robotic\nrovers will resume the remotely operated type of activity\nthat occurred during Phase 1 of Mission 1. All other\nsurface systems are likely to be dormant for the duration\nof Phase 1. The crew habitat could be problematic in this\nphase because of potential difficulties placing the\nenvironmental control and life support systems (ECLSS)\n\ninto a dormant state once this system has been wetted.\nDuring Phases 2 through 5, all surface assets are assumed\nto be operating some or all of the time. The ISRU plant\nwill be operating but at a reduced level to provide any\nmake-up LOX needed by the MAV or to produce\nbreathing gases for extravehicular activity (EVA) and\nhabitation make-up. The FSPS will be operating at nearly\nfull power while the crew is at the primary habitat.\nTraverses using the two small pressurized rovers will be a\ncommon event during Phase 4. These traverses are\nassumed to last for two weeks. During these traverses the\nmain habitat is occupied by 2 crew members and therefore\nis not put into a dormant mode, allowing for any-time\nreturn of the crew. When not on a traverse the small\npressurized rovers are likely to remain in operation to\nprovide habitable space for the crew as well as to allow\nmaintenance, restocking, etc. The small robotic rovers are\nassumed to be continuously operating during Phases 2-5\neither under the control of the surface crew or personnel\non Earth. There are two small unpressurized rovers\navailable for the crew to be used in the general vicinity of\nthe landers, assisting local EVAs. These rovers are also\nassumed to be part of a contingency rescue system while\nthe small pressurized rovers are on a traverse. Thus these\nrovers will be very active during Phases 3 and 5 and will\nbe on stand-by during the traverses conducted in Phase 4.\nScience instruments are assumed to be active periodically\nduring Phases 2-5 but the duty cycle is difficult to project.\nSome of these instruments will also remain active during\nPhase 6. A \xe2\x80\x9clarge\xe2\x80\x9d drill is one exception to this comment\nabout science instruments. This device is likely to be used\nonly under the supervision of the crew, but for planetary\nprotection reasons the crew will likely tele-operate this\ndevice. It is likely to be used several times only during\nPhase 4 of the surface mission and otherwise remain\ndormant.\n\nDORMANT OPERATIONS OF HUMAN\nSPACECRAFT SYSTEMS\nThe previous section described notional Mars surface\noperations. This section will describe specific capabilities\nand systems that have been identified by SMT subject\nmatter experts. Initially, planned operations during\ndormant periods were defined and assessed at a system\nlevel in order to define the unique capabilities which will\nbe needed by each vehicle system. The information\npresented here was derived from representative operations\nof individual systems of the surface habitat during\ndormant periods.\n\npg. 6\n\nVehicle Systems Operated During Dormant Periods\nCommunications and navigation supports the transfer of\ninformation between in-space elements and from in-space\nelements to the ground, as well as tracking those elements\nto determine orbits and trajectory maneuvers.\nLong-range communications and navigation will\nremain active during periods of dormancy, since\na state of awareness will be needed for receiving\ncommands and providing telemetry to ensure\nthat the dormant vehicle systems are nominally\nreporting their state to the ground and if\nteleoperations are planned. Point-to-point and\nshort range comm systems may be inactive at\ntimes, but will be needed to support rendezvous\nand docking operations with an approaching\nvehicle as well as monitoring of ascent/descent\noperations and surface operations. An important\nmode for the communications and navigation\nsystem during dormant periods will be fault\nmanagement, if it experiences a problem it may\nneed to take appropriate autonomous action.\nThe environmental control and life support systems and\nenvironment monitoring (ECLSS-EM) provides essential\nlife support and monitoring capabilities for the crew.\nDormant operations will require unique ECLSS\ncapabilities for: monitoring, maintenance, safing\noperations, and surface operations. Expanded\nmonitoring of the pressure and atmosphere will\nbe needed to detect structural leakage, potentially\ncaused by micrometeoroids & orbital debris\n(MMOD) or leakage of the systems into the\ncabin. The levels, pressures, etc. of stored fluids\n& consumables also will need to be monitored.\nIf fans and ventilation motors are required to\nmaintain thermal conditioning during dormant\nperiods, parameters such as the motor power vs\nspeed, pressure drop, etc. will need to be\nmonitored to detect failures. The periodic\nmeasurement of fluid quality may also be needed\nbut is less frequent. Additional types or locations\nof sample points of environmental monitoring\nwill need to be addressed. With the expanded\nmonitoring capabilities and the extended\noperational lifetimes, sensor life and calibration\nis a concern, with the potential need for\nautonomous recalibration of sensors and\ndefinition of associated calibration standards.\nThe data resulting from the monitoring will need\nto be periodically analyzed to determine the\neffects of dormancy on ECLSS functions such as\n\noxygen generation, waste water recovery, fluid\nquality, etc.\nPreventative maintenance tasks will need to be\nconducted during dormant periods and may\ninclude: periodic exercising of moving\ncomponents (fans, cycle valves); recirculation to\nfilter/flush stored fluids; microbial control of\nsurfaces or parts (ultraviolet (UV) light, vapors\nin air); and maintenance of different\nenvironmental conditions than during crewed\noperations (i.e., lower than usual temperatures,\ndifferent atmospheric pressures or gas mixtures)\nto reduce microbial growth or extend life of\nECLSS components. Stored consumables also\nwould have residual biocides to prevent\nmicrobial growth. Corrective maintenance tasks\nalso may be needed during dormant periods, and\nwould include the dosing of biocide or flushes\nafter \xe2\x80\x9cfailed\xe2\x80\x9d measurements. The proper mix of\non-orbit data analysis to identify issues or trigger\nmaintenance versus examination of patterns or\ntrends in the measurements from Earth will need\nto be determined.\nWhen a crew prepares to depart a vehicle, safing\noperations will need to be conducted to place the\nECLSS in a dormant state and prepare it for use\nby the next crew. For example fluid systems will\nneed to be flushed with clean or other\nappropriately treated fluids. Safing operations\nwill require additional consumables for the\nflushing/purging operations, the activities may\nbe time consuming for the crew, and the\noperations will present additional challenges\nwhen conducted in microgravity. When the next\ncrew arrives following a dormant period, the\nECLSS will need to be reactivated, the system\nperformance will have to be evaluated prior to\ncrew arrival, and the environmental conditions\nassessed before crew entry into the vehicle.\nECLSS systems used in surface habitats will\nhave additional challenges, including the need to\ninteract with the ISRU system to recharge fluid\nstores. If a reduced oxygen (O2) atmosphere is\nemployed during dormant periods (as discussed\nin the fire safety section), excess nitrogen also\nmay be required from the ISRU. Additionally,\nan in-situ sterilization capability may be needed\nto address planetary protection concerns.\nFire safety is considered a branch of ECLSS.\n\npg. 7\n\nDormant operations will require unique fire\nsafety capabilities in the areas of monitoring, fire\nsuppression, fire cleanup, and occupancy\npreparations. Continuous monitoring of system\nstates will be needed that could indicate short\ncircuit/smoldering as well as periodic air\ncirculation and monitoring of the cabin\natmosphere.\nThe current fire suppression\nsystems typically are hand-held and employed by\ncrew members. The lack of crew during dormant\noperations will drive the need for a fixed\nsuppression system, which in previous spacecraft\nhave been mass prohibitive. An option would be\nto employ a robotic system with the ability to use\nan existing hand-held gaseous (not water based)\nsuppression system or a robotic \xe2\x80\x9cSynchronized\nPosition\nHold\nEngage\nand\nReorient\nExperimental Satellite\xe2\x80\x9d (SPHERES) with\nsensing and fire suppression capabilities. In the\nevent of a fire, an automated cleanup system\nwould be needed to remove the gaseous\ncombustion products from the atmosphere.\nAnother concern for fire detection and\nsuppression arises if a reduced O2 atmosphere is\nused during a dormant period. The timeframe for\nrestoration of the cabin to a habitable atmosphere\n(21% O2 at 1 atm. of pressure) will need to be\ndefined if it occurs in days, weeks, or months in\nadvance of the crew arrival. In this timeframe, as\nthe system transitions between a reduced O2\natmosphere and a habitable atmosphere, the best\napproach for fire detection and suppression also\nwill need to be defined.\nThe power system generates and manages the power\nnecessary to operate the vehicle.\nThe power system will need to be active at all\ntimes during dormant operations and most likely\nwould not be shut down in order to maintain\npropellant conditioning and keep the avionics\nand communications systems operational and the\nheaters\nactive\nto\nmaintain\nsystem\ntemperatures. However, if a reduced power\nmode is used during dormancy there would be no\nneed to shunt power for solar powered elements;\nthe array regulator will continue to regulate the\nvoltage and the excess power will be radiated off\nthe back of the array. In the event of a complete\nshutdown due to some type of catastrophic\nfailure, the system should include a \xe2\x80\x9cLazarus\nMode\xe2\x80\x9d to allow the power system to be restarted\nand will include a long life emergency battery\nthat would enable an emergency restart in the\n\nevent that all else fails. Additionally, the kilopower unit, batteries, and solar arrays may\nrequire maintenance during dormant periods:\ncharge and discharge cycles and the depth of the\ndischarge will impact the battery life and\ncapacity, while the radiation environment in\nMars orbit will degrade the solar array\nperformance. Active dust mitigation will be\nneeded on the solar arrays.\nPropulsion provides crew and cargo transportation from\nthe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface, though space, to an exploration\ndestination, and back. Five key capability areas include:\n(1) high-thrust, in-space propulsion; (2) low-thrust, inspace propulsion; (3) descent propulsion; (4) ascent\npropulsion; and (5) attitude control propulsion.\nDormant operations will require unique\npropulsion capabilities for system monitoring,\npropellant storage & transfer, and long duration\nenvironmental exposure. Propulsion systems\nwill require monitoring during dormant periods\nto assure that pressurant leakage, propellant\nleakage, and propellant boil-off (with goal of\nzero boil-off under steady state operations) is\nwithin acceptable low levels. As with other\nsystems, an approach also will be needed for\nhealth monitoring and checking of the main\npropulsion system prior to reactivation following\na dormant period.\nFirst-of-a-kind,\nlong-duration\ncryogenic\npropellant storage and transfer systems will be\nneeded for terrestrial and in-space use during\ndormancy, incorporating cryogenic fluid\nmanagement technologies:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Propellant quantity monitoring and\ngauging (in gravity and in microgravity)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Very\nlong-duration\nlow-leakage\ncryogenic valves and regulators\n(requires development)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Passive propellant conditioning systems\n(including low-conductivity structures,\nadvanced\nmulti-layer\ninsulation,\nthermodynamic vent systems with\npropellant acquisition, and vapor cooled\nshielding)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Active propellant conditioning systems\nfor boil-off control incorporating new\ncryocoolers\nZero-G propellant acquisition and propellant\nconditioning/delivery will be needed for the\nattitude control system (O2/methane (CH4)),\n\npg. 8\n\nwhich is also used for minimizing solar heating\nand for station-keeping.\nOn the surface,\nautomated propellant transfer associated with\nISRU production will be needed.\nA number of concerns and challenges exist\nrelated to long duration environmental exposure\nof propulsion system components during periods\nof dormancy. The reliability of electrical\ncomponents such as engine igniters, controllers,\nthrust vector control (TVC) motors, avionics,\nbatteries in electromechanical actuators (EMAs)\nare a concern after long duration exposure to\nradiation. Degradation of materials over long\nduration space and Mars surface environment\nexposure is another challenge. For example,\nvalves sticking or leaking due to degradation of\nseals will drive valve technology development\nand redundancy strategy. Degradation of\nlubricants for moving parts, TVC, etc. also is a\nconcern.\nComposite overwrapped pressure\nvessels (COPVs) could experience overwrap\nfailures due to radiation exposure as well as\nstress rupture failure modes due to pressure\ncycles and thermal cycles. Additionally, the\npotential for foreign object debris (FOD) may\ndrive design to all metal tanks. MMOD and\nsurface debris have the potential to affect\nmultiple systems. The integrity of tank and\npropellant line insulation must be maintained\nsince it is difficult to repair. As the vehicle life\nrequirement is extended system robustness must\nbe considered. (Current references such as\nvacuum jacketed tanks and lines with multilayer\ninsulation (MLI) provide a passive option albeit\nwith a potential mass penalty). Long durations\nalso have the potential for an increase in helium\ndemand for purges, pneumatics, and possibly for\nengine restart requirements.\nStructures provides the mechanical support for the vehicle\nsystems and consists of two main capability areas: (1)\nPrimary structure and (2) secondary structure.\nDormant operations will require unique\nstructures capabilities for system monitoring,\nmodeling,\nand\nself-healing\nmaterials.\nAutonomous sustainment of habitat and vehicle\nstructures in the in-space and planetary surface\nenvironment will be a reliability challenge, both\nthrough extended periods of occupancy and\ndormancy. Since data currently are not available\non long term exposure of crewed vehicle\nspacecraft structures in a deep space\n\nenvironment (from either environmental\nmaterial/structural aging or discrete source\ndamage threats such as MMOD impacts),\ncontinuous health monitoring (diagnosis &\nprognosis) and evaluation of structural integrity,\nresidual strength, and life of critical elements\nwill be needed. This monitoring capability will\ninclude integrated vehicle health monitoring\n(IVHM) (e.g., microphones, strain gauges, and\nembedded sensors) along with non-destructive\nevaluation (NDE) capabilities (e.g., ultrasound,\nthermography, x-ray,). IVHM will need to be\noperational and continuously collecting data\nprior to integration and launch and throughout all\nmission stages as well as supporting diagnostic\nor prognostic data. Using certified physics-based\nmodels, informed by the real-time IVHM data to\nadjust the structural and system integrity (life),\nthe resulting data will be analyzed by mission\ncontrollers who will decide to adapt mission\nparameters to ensure safety or to recommend\nrepair and maintenance operations. Certification\nof the structures following dormant periods in the\nin-space/surface environment also will be\nneeded. Additionally, use of autonomous selfhealing/failsafe materials incorporated into the\nhabitat primary structures can aid prevention of\natmosphere leakage due to an impact event. A\nrobotic capability potentially could be used to\nconduct structural inspection operations (e.g.,\nNDE) and perform associated preventative &\ncorrective maintenance activities during\nunoccupied periods.\nThermal provides thermal control for spacecraft,\nmanagement of cryogens, and protection from the heat of\natmospheric entry, ensuring spacecraft and crewmembers\nare maintained within safe and comfortable limits. It\nincludes three key capability areas: (1) active and passive\nthermal control, (2) thermal protection systems, and (3)\ncryogenic systems.\nDormant operations will require unique thermal\ncapabilities for: monitoring and maintenance of\nspacecraft and surface element thermal control\nsystems. Spacecraft system temperatures will\nrequire monitoring in order to control heat\nrejection turndown. Thermal transport loop fluid\nquantities will be monitored for leakage\nevaluation and cryogenic fluid quantities will be\nmonitored to assess boil-off rates. Thermal\ntransport loop pump performance will be\nmonitored as well as thermal transport loop fluid\n\npg. 9\n\nchemistry for corrosion evaluation. Preventative\nmaintenance capabilities during dormant periods\ninclude dosing of the thermal transport loop for\ncorrect chemistry maintenance.\nCorrective\nmaintenance may include the need for remote\nvalve control for radiator loop isolation to\ncompensate for potential leaks. The capability to\nswap transport loop pumps through an automated\ntransition may also be needed. Surface element\nthermal systems will require capabilities for\nmonitoring radiator surface emissivity to assure\nradiators maintain an appropriate heat rejection\ncapability during dormant periods. Periodic\nremoval of surface dust from the radiators will be\nneeded to maintain the appropriate heat rejection\ncapability, which could be accomplished through\nautomated capabilities such as coatings or an\nelectrostatic cleaning system to repel dust\nparticles. Additionally, a robotic system to\nperiodically clean dust from radiator surfaces\ncould be employed.\nAutonomous and Robotic Support Systems\nThe following sections discuss those capabilities provided\nby the autonomous and robotic systems to support the\noverall vehicle and supporting subsystems during\ndormancy:\nAutonomous mission operations (AMO) includes all\nprotocols, controls, and systems to ensure missions are\nexecuted safely and effectively, and includes four\ncapability areas, which vary based on whether mission\ncontrol (ground), crew, or systems within the vehicle are\nperforming the function: (1) monitor displays, (2) perform\nprocedures, (3) execute timeline, and (4) fault\nmanagement:\nDormant operations will require unique AMO\ncapabilities in all of the above defined capability\nareas. Monitoring displays will not be performed\non the vehicle during dormant periods since no\ncrew are present However, system displays in\nmission control (ground) will need to be\nmanaged similar to how deep space (Mars and\nouter planets) robotic missions are conducted\ntoday. As the time delay increases, real-time\nmonitoring on the ground becomes more batchdriven data playback and analysis.\nPre-planned initiation of procedures will be\nconducted on-board the spacecraft to operate\nvehicle systems as part of a plan uplinked from\nthe ground (see execute timeline below). These\n\nprocedures can be part of maintenance activities,\nscience activities, maneuvers, etc. Procedure\nexecution status will be recorded and sent to the\nground for analysis (e.g., when the procedure\nstarted, ended, succeeded or not, steps/\ncommands performed). Procedures must be\nflexible enough that, in case there are unexpected\nevents or faults, the vehicle does not have to\nimmediately halt procedure execution, but can\nproceed by postponing or promoting steps,\nreordering steps, or skipping steps that are\novertaken by events. Once the vehicle reaches\ndistances of larger than ~1 light minute, initiation\nof procedures and direct commanding from the\nground becomes inefficient for nominal\noperations. However, in some cases, initiation of\nprocedures from ground can be performed even\nat Mars distances.\nExecute timeline is the automated execution of\nthe plan as uplinked from ground. The plan\nincludes the procedures to perform, as discussed\nabove; the difference is that the plan consists of\nsequences of procedures, including multiple\nprocedures active simultaneously. As with the\nprocedures, the plan should also be flexible\nenough that, in case there are unexpected events\nor faults, the vehicle does not have to halt plan\nexecution immediately, but can proceed by\npostponing or promoting activities, reordering\nactivities, skipping activities that are overtaken\nby events, and opportunistically performing\nactivities if time permits. Significant problems\n(major faults or inability to replan due to difficult\nconstraints) will be reported to ground, and\naddressed in the ground-based planning cycle\n(see fault management below). The daily,\nweekly and monthly planning of spacecraft\nactivities will be similar to the process currently\nutilized for spacecraft, including analysis of\nresources (power, ECLSS, mass properties,\ntrajectory and navigation). The daily plan will be\nuplinked to the vehicle and activity status will be\nreturned from the vehicle to the ground in a\nmanner similar to that currently used for Mars\nand outer-planet robotic missions. Note this may\nmean that, on a specific day, the status from\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s plan is available, while today\xe2\x80\x99s plan\nis being executed, and tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s plan is being\nproduced.\nFault management or IVHM onboard the vehicle\nwill require the ability to detect, isolate and\n\npg. 10\n\nrecover from time-critical faults. On-board fault\nmanagement may change a plan (see execute\ntimeline above) to perform fault-specific\nprocedures (see Procedures above). If the fault\ncannot be identified, recovered from, or\nmitigated, then it must be managed on the\nground. As distance increases, the number of\ntime critical faults increases as well. The onboard\nfault management function must generalize\nexisting onboard fault-management functions to\naddress more problems than traditionally\nmanaged onboard low Earth orbit (LEO)\nspacecraft, due to the larger time delays between\nground and spacecraft. In the presence of\ncomplex faults or non-time-critical faults, the\nground will conduct analysis of faults, planning\nfault recovery actions, and pre-planned initiation\nof procedures to operate vehicle systems to\nrecover from faults as part of a plan (see execute\ntimeline above).\nSome ground-based\ncommanding to retrieve high-rate data for\nanalysis is possible even at Mars distances.\nRobotic systems enable dormant operations by\nperforming preventative and corrective maintenance tasks\nthat human crews typically would perform during\noccupied phases. EMC robotic systems can be divided\ninto two archetypes based on the mobility approach and\nwhere the system is used (intra-vehicular activity (IVA)\nor EVA).\nDormant operations will require incorporation of\nrobotics capabilities into crewed and uncrewed\nspacecraft to perform preventative and corrective\nmaintenance of human serviceable spacecraft\nsystems. The use of robotic systems for\nmaintenance and repair of spacecraft systems\nduring dormant periods is analogous to human\ntended facilities in a terrestrial environment. The\nrobotic system requirements for these types of\ntasks will vary according to the maintenance and\nrepair requirements of the spacecraft systems.\nThese spacecraft systems will be designed to\nallow servicing, repair, or replacement of\ncomponents up to entire subsystems. Archetypes\nof robotic system requirements to conduct\nmaintenance and repair of this type include\nlightweight, dexterous and strong hands that are\nable to handle interfaces like handles, knobs,\nvalves, and power tools. Lightweight and strong\narms will be able to position tools, connect cables\nand hoses, and carry spare parts to a worksite.\nMobility for micro gravity is more akin to\n\nclimbing, so robotic legs and feet are designed to\ninterface with crew hand rails and other hard\npoints on spacecraft designed for human use to\nprovide access to maintenance and repair sites.\nOn the outside of spacecraft there will be\nspecialized interfaces for EVA gear like the\nworksite interface fixture, a socket designed to\nreceive stabilizing foot restraints used by the\nhuman crew. Today\xe2\x80\x99s robots are able to handle\ntools and objects as previously described, and\nboard-level maintenance on computers,\nreplacing valves, cleaning tubes and filters,\nswapping fuses, and other small scale\nmaintenance is possible. All systems need to\nhave design requirements that accommodate\nthese robotic maintenance and repair\ncapabilities.\nRobotics will conduct monitoring tasks, such as\ninspecting plumbing and electrical networks by\nusing\ninstruments\nand\nhand\nsensors.\nTroubleshooting & board level diagnostics and\nrepair also will need to be conducted by robotics,\nas appropriate. Prior to maneuvers, robotics may\nconduct inspections to identify loose hardware\n\xe2\x80\x9cfloaters\xe2\x80\x9d and ensure they are secured.\nSimilarly, robotics can play a role in logistics\ntasks by locating and returning objects to\ninventory, using radio-frequency identification\n(RFID) readers and vision systems. Robotics\nalso will be needed to perform a number of\npreventative maintenance tasks, identified as\nbeing serviceable by robotics, such as:\nmaintenance of orbital replacement unit (ORU)\nelements; inspecting and cleaning tubes and\nfilters; and cleaning touch surfaces to prevent\nbiofilm and other biological growth. Likewise,\nrobotics will perform corrective maintenance\ntasks such as: removing computer boards and\ninstalling new ones; replacing valves and tubes;\nand replacing wear components like tires,\nblankets and covers on surface systems. Robotics\nalso will be used on the surface for tasks in\npreparation for occupancy/ departure, such as:\nunloading cargo from landers/logistics supply\nvehicles; collecting geological samples; setting\nup large scale science instruments like\ngeophones; loading of science payloads for\nreturn to earth; and inspection, safing, &\nshutdown of systems as needed.\n\npg. 11\n\nSeveral additional candidate robotic capabilities\nneeded to support dormant operations also were\nidentified in the vehicle capability section:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Robotic capability to use existing handheld gaseous fire suppression system\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Robotic capability such as SPHERES\nwith sensing and fire suppression\ncapabilities\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Robotic capability to conduct structural\ninspection operations (e.g., NDE) and\nperform\nassociated\npreventative/corrective\nmaintenance\nactivities\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Robotic capability to periodically clean\ndust from radiator surfaces on planetary\nsurface\nIn addition to AMO and robotics, ISRU also will support\nsurface systems during dormant periods as well as require\ncapabilities and support from AMO and robotics.\nISRU capability involves any hardware or operation that\nharnesses and utilizes in-situ resources to create products\nand services for robotic and human exploration. ISRU is\ncomposed of five capability areas: (1) resource\ncharacterization and mapping, (2) mission consumable\nproduction, (3) civil engineering and surface construction,\n(4) in-situ energy generation, storage, and transfer, and (5)\nin-situ manufacturing and repair.\nIn preparation for dormant operations, ISRU may\nsupport occupancy and departure tasks by\nproviding resources for safing operations. From\na Mars ISRU perspective, there are 4 potential\npurge gases that can be used for safing\noperations: carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2),\nargon (Ar), and hydrogen (H2). For cryogenic\nsystems, only H2 has a low enough melting point\nto prevent freezing of liquid O2 and CH4\nareas. However, N2 can be used for purging\n\xe2\x80\x98warmer\xe2\x80\x99 areas, such as dormant engines, but\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be used to purge lines after usage. ISRU\nalso may require support from robotic systems to\nperform preventative and corrective maintenance\nto ISRU systems, including rovers, during\ndormant periods.\nAn overview of the unique capabilities needed for the\nindividual spacecraft systems during dormant operations\nof long-duration human exploration missions was\npresented in the individual system sections above.\nSUMMARY\n\nThis paper has identified critical operations needed to\nsurvive dormant periods identified in the EMC. Also, key\ncapabilities needed for a variety of systems have been\nidentified and analyzed. This information will assist the\ncontinued study of the EMC and can be used for future\nhuman exploration mission trade analysis.\nSummary of key drivers during dormancy operations:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Expanded\nsensing\nand\nmonitoring\ncapabilities will be needed beyond what is\ncurrently employed on existing vehicles,\nsuch as ISS.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Additional sensors throughout\nvehicle and systems\n\xe2\x80\x93 Sensor life and calibration is a\nconcern\n\xe2\x80\x93 Multiple vehicles may be dormant\nat one time that will need to be\nmonitored\n\xe2\x80\x93 Impacts to on-board and ground\ncommunications/data systems\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The execution of dormant operations will\nneed to be balanced between vehicle system\nautomation, robotic systems, and ground\ncontrol.\n\xe2\x80\x93 On-board software to detect faults,\ndetermine\nthe\nroot\ncause,\ndetermine the ramifications of the\nroot cause, and define appropriate\ncourse of action\n\xe2\x80\x93 What level of on-board processing\nwill be required versus downlink to\nground?\n\xe2\x80\x93 Robotics capabilities needed to\nperform\npreventative\nand\ncorrective maintenance\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Preparations for dormant periods between\nthe operational/occupied phases will present\nunique challenges.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Reactivation activities to bring the\nvehicle out of a dormant state\n\xe2\x80\x93 Capabilities/operations to place\nvehicle in dormant state after being\noperational\n\nFUTURE WORK\nThe HEOMD\xe2\x80\x99s EMC and SMT activities will continue to\nstudy dormant operations applicable to human exploration\nof Mars.
