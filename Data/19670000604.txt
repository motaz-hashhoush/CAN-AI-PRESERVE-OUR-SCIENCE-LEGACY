With the conventional method,\nusing shear waves, many extremely small or very shallow defects were undetectable.\nThe-solution:\n\nLamb waves offer improved sensitivity and resolution for the detection of small defects in thin plates\nand small diameter, thin-walled tubing. This improvement over shear waves applies to both longitudinal\nand transverse flaws in the specimens.\nHow it's done:\n\nLamb waves consist of an infinite number of modes\nof vibration that can be generated in elastic materials. In a given material, each Lamb wave mode has\na different velocity of propagation (phase velocity),\ndependent upon the thickness of the specimen, the\nwave frequency, the order of the mode and the material in which the wave is generated. Thin materials\n\nare the most suitable for the generation and detection\nof Lamb waves at ultrasonic frequencies.\nLamb waves can be generated in thin materials\n(plates or tubing) in the manner shown in the figure:\nA longitudinal sound wave with a speed VL is sent\nthrough a coupling medium, usually water, such that\nit strikes the plate specimen at angle 0. The speed\nat which the line of contact of any wave, front runs\nalong the surface of the plate is\nVa = V L/Sifl Oj\nIf the speed Va equals the phase velocity of a Lamb\nwave mode, the mode is generated in the plate by a\nresonance process. The wave travels down the plate\nand'radiates from it, along the entire length, with an\nexit angle OE equal to 01. A receiving transducer,\npositioned at angle 0e, will detect this energy, which\ncan be amplified and displayed.\nOnce a Lamb wave is generated, it will continue to\ntravel down the plate, attenuated but otherwise undisturbed, until it reaches a discontinuity such as the\nedge of the plate or a flaw. A flaw or crack is easily\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the Atomic\t\nliability resulting from the use of the information contained in this\nEnergy Commission and/or the National Aeronautics and Space document, or warrants that the use of any information, apparatus,\nAdministration.

A receiver transducer aimed at this flaw area thus indicates the presence of the flaw by the absence of a signal.\nA flaw can also be detected using one transducer\nas both sender and receiver. In this configuration, no\nsignal is received until the Lamb wave reaches a discontinuity. The mode is, in part, reflected from the\ndiscontinuity and travels back along the plate. It also\nis radiated from the plate at an exit angle OE equal\nto O, and thus can be detected by the same transducer that was used to generate it.\nThe technique itself is identical to that used for\nshear wave testing, although a completely different\nstress wave is involved. Using the one-transducer\nmethod and a simulated crack, numerous experiments\nwere run which illustrated that greater sensitivity and\nresolution for nondestructive testing can be obtained\nwith Lamb waves.\nNotes:\n1. The main limitation of this technique is the necessary critical alignment of the equipment.\n\nBrief 67-10605\t\n\n2.
