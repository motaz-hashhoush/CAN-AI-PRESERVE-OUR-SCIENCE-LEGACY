In certain research situations, such as use\naboard a space vehicle, a boom is needed that will\ncarry electrical contduc t ors yet be capable of compact storage. Available designs either are too\nbulky or they are not suitable for carrying the electrical conductors.\nThe solution: A boom constructed from a metal\nstrip that can be rolled into a storage drum. This\ndesign will carry- three separate electrical conductor tapes. When extended, the boom has an effective length of 21 feet. Tape is curved in cross\nsection so that the boom automatically forms a\ntube shape as it is extended.\n\nDrum Outer Surface\n\nHow it\'s done: A flat beryllium copper strip 4\ninches wide by 0.005 inch, heat treated into a\ntubular shape, forms the structural member of\nthis extensible boom. The strip can be extended\nor retracted by a motor drive mechanism and rolled\ninto a storage drum approximately 3 inches in diameter. When the boom is formed, as the strip unwinds, the edges overlap slightly resulting in a\ncross section that is almost, but not quite, circular\nwith a nominal diameter of 1.25 inches. Three conductor tapes also extend or retract with the boom\nand are enclosed by the copper strip as it forms\ninto a tube shape.\nThe conductor tapes are wound on the storage\ndrum by an "interchange loop" method. Since\nthe boom strip and the conductor tapes are fixed\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

One, a smaller core drum, is mounted to\nthe sideplates and remains stationary. The larger\nmain storage drum is rotated by an electric motor.\nBetween the two drums there is a space called\nthe interchange chamber. When the boom and\nconductor tapes are retracted, rollers first flatten\nthe tapes, which then are fed through a slot, reversed in direction, and reversed again to form a\nloop. As the outer drum turns, the slot and tape\nloop cause the tapes to wrap around the stationary\ninner drum.\n\nBrief 64-10011\n\nNotes:\nI. This compact extensible boom system might\nbe applied to the design of antenna mechanisms\nfor aircraft and for mobile radio and TV vehicles.\n2.
