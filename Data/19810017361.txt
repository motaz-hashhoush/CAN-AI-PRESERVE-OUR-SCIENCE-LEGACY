New observations during Martian late fall in\nthe south were made.\nINTRODUCTION\nOzone was discovered on Mars by the ultraviolet\nspectrometer on board the\nMariner 7 spacecraft\n(Barth and Hord, 1971), and was subsequently measured\nextensively from the Mariner 9 orbiter (Barth et al., 1973; Lane et al.,\n1973; Barth and Dick, 1974; Wehrbein, 1979).\nThose measurements\ndemonstrated variations in both its vertical and global distribution.\nThe total\nozone amount was found to be a maximum during winter over the north pole\nbut slowly decreased throughout the spring.\nIn the south it was absent\nduring the Martian midsummer season but appeared again in late summer.\nDaily variations were also observed and were occasionally\nassociated with\nthe presence of clouds.\nThe general conclusion of these observations was\nthat ozone is present when the Mars atmosphere is cold and dry.\nThe photochemical theory of ozone, which considers the role o_ water vapor, supports\nthis conclusion.\nThe Mariner measurements were restricted to northern winter-spring,\nand\nsouthern summer.\nIn this report we describe a technique of using the IUE\nsatellite to observe ozone on Mars, and present the results of a preliminary analysis on some of the data acquired.\nTECHNIQUE\nOzone is detected by observing its absorption of sunlight in the wavelength\nregion from 2100 to 2800 _ where the Hartley bands have a peak cross section\nof i x lO-l?cm 2. Because of its restricted global distribution on Mars, a\nsuccessful detection with IUE depends on the ability to restrict the instrument\'s field of view to that region of the planet where ozone is present.\nAs shown in Figure i, the angular diameter of the planet as seen from earth\nhas varied between 5 and 13.8 arc sec since April of 1979.\nThe optimum\nobserving time is at opposition when the 3 arc see small aperture includes\nonly about 5% of the bright disk.\nIdeally the small aperture would be\n\n33\n\nplaced\n\nover the winter\n\npole where\n\nMariner\n\nfound\n\nozone\n\nto bemost\n\nabundant.\n\nHowever Figure i shows that the aspect b_ M_rs also varies considerably,\nwiththe\nsub-Earth point moving between -25 v latitude.\nDuring the February\nopposition the northern hemisphere faced the Earth and provided the opportunity to observe the northern mid to late spring,\nUnder these same conditions Mariner observed between 5 and I0 _-atm. of ozone (l_-atm. = 2.68 x\nI0-Is molecules cm-S).\nThe drift rate of Mars with respect to the stars and its position were\ncalculated in spacecraft-centered\ncoordinates.\nEven though Mars had a\nmaximum magnitude of -0.3 it was possible to track using the center-oflight lock after placing the planet in the large aperture.\nThe pattern of\nscattered light in the Fine-Error-Sensor\n(FES) image was monitored to\nverify the tracking.\nDuring an observing session a pattern of five exposures were made as shown in Figure 2. Displacements were made in ecliptic\ncoordinates by first slewing the spacecraft 4.5 aTc sec in the desired\ndirection from the center-of-llght\npoint and then moving directly to the\nsmall aperture.\nThe orientation\nof Mars shown in Figure 2 is for March 15,\n1980.\nIn January, before the opposition,\nthe terminator was to the west of\nthe planet and its north pole was 10 deg closer to ecliptic north.\nBetween\nJanuary and April the phase angle varied between -30 and +30 deg.\nObservations were made on September 25, 1979 and on January 23, March 15,\nand April 8, 1980 with exposure times varying from 9 to 75 see.\nThese\nexposures were made with the long wavelength\ncamera in low resolution using\nboth the large and small apertures.\nFor the observations with the small\naperture a i0 sec exposure gave good signal without saturation.\nOBSERVATIONS\nFrom the set of observations made in the pattern shown in Figure 2, the\nrelative reflectance\nof the various regions of Mars was calculated as\nfollows.\nThe center-of-llght\nobservation\nfrom each session was taken to\nrepresent the equatorial region and was used as the standard spectrum.\nEach of the other four observations were divided by this spectrum and the\nratio was normalized to unity in the 3000 _ region.\nThe extracted net\nspectra computed by the IUE data processing operation were used.\nFigures 3 and 4 show the relative reflectance\nspectra for the wavelength\nregion from 2400 to 3000 _.\nIn each figure the ratio for the northern\nregion is on the right and that for the southern region is on the left.\nThe data were smoothed by an ll-point running average before the ratio was\ncalculated.\nIn all of the southern ratios and in the northern ratio for\nJanuary, the smooth\nof ozone normalized\n\ncurve plotted\nto the data.\n\nover\n\nthe data is the absorption\n\nspectrum\n\nOn the basis of this analysis, we conclude that these observations have\ndetected ozone in the Mars atmosphere.\nThe observations of the northern\nregion in January and March occurred when the Martian seasons were mldand\nlate spring respectively.\nThey show a positive detection in mldsprlng and\n\n34\n\nthe absence of ozone in\nMariner 9 over the north\nfor Martian mid to late\nsince Mariner 9 did not\n\nlate spring.\nThis is the same behavior observed by\npole.\nThe observations of the southern region are\nfall.\nThese IUE observations\ncontain new information\noSserve the south during those seasons.\n\nREFERENCES\ni.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nBarth, C.A. and C.W.
