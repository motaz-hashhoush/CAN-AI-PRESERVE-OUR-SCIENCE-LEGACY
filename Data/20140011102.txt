These assumptions include the following:\n1. Space, especially Low Earth Orbit (LEO), will always be available to governmental and commercial\nspace entities that launch Earth remote sensing missions.\n2. Space launches are benign with respect to environmental impacts.\n3. Minimization of Type 1 error, which provides increased con\xef\xac\x81dence in the experimental outcome, is\nthe best way to assess the signi\xef\xac\x81cance of environmental change.\n4. Large-area remote sensing investigations, i.e. national, continental, global studies, are best done\nfrom space.\n5. National space missions should trump international, cooperative space missions to ensure national\ncontrol and distribution of the data products.\nAt best, all of these points are arguable, and in some cases, they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. Development of observational\nspace systems that are compatible with sustainability principles should be a primary concern when Earth\nremote sensing space systems are envisioned, designed, and launched. The discussion is based on the hypothesis that reducing the environmental impacts of the data acquisition step, which is at the very beginning of\nthe information stream leading to decision and action, will enhance coherence in the information stream and\nstrengthen the capacity of measurement processes to meet their stated functional goal, i.e. sustainable management of Earth resources. We suggest that unconventional points of view should be adopted and when\nappropriate, remedial measures considered that could help to reduce the environmental footprint of space\nremote sensing and of Earth observation and monitoring systems in general. This article discusses these \xef\xac\x81ve\nassumptions in the context of sustainable management of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s resources. Taking each assumption in turn, we\n\xef\xac\x81nd the following:\n(1) Space debris may limit access to Low Earth Orbit over the next decades.\n(2) Relatively speaking, given that they\xe2\x80\x99re rare event, space launches may be benign, but study is\nmerited on upper stratospheric and exospheric layers given the chemical activity associated with rocket\ncombustion by-products.\n(3) Minimization of Type II error should be considered in situations where minimization of Type I error\ngreatly hampers or precludes our ability to correct the environmental condition being studied.\n(4) In certain situations, airborne collects may be less expensive and more environmentally benign,\nand comparative studies should be done to determine which path is wisest.\n(5) International cooperation and data sharing will reduce instrument and launch costs and mission\nredundancy. Given \xef\xac\x81scal concerns of most of the major space agencies e e.g. NASA, ESA, CNES e it seems\nprudent to combine resources.\n\xc3\x93 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n\nKeywords:\nSpace remote sensing\nEarth observation systems\nSpace junk\nSustainability\nSustainable management\nLidar\nForest\nBiomass\nLife cycle assessment\n\n1.

Presently, constantly\nimproved and updated information is a given for resource monitoring and management as they can capture the dynamic nature of\nenvironmental conditions such as climate change, water allocation,\nas well as soil and biodiversity loss [2].\nAs early as in 1969, in the \xef\xac\x81rst editorial of the Remote Sensing of\nEnvironment journal, Simonett [1] stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe quickening of\nscience, and resource use, and the demands of society have\nincreased the urgency to obtain quantitative, timely information\nabout the environment at a variety of scales in space and time\xe2\x80\x9d. He\nposited that observations made using ground-based sensors,\naircraft, and space platforms could help to meet these information\nrequirements [1]. Three years later, the launch of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s Resources Technology Satellite ERTS-1, later renamed Landsat-1,\nmarked the beginning of the Landsat era, thereby providing signi\xef\xac\x81cant impetus for the development of environmental applications based on remote sensing data at local to global scales [3].\nSome of the most common applications in the remote sensing\nworld, such as agriculture or water management, can be traced\nback to research performed on speci\xef\xac\x81c landscape features identi\xef\xac\x81ed by Kondratyev et al. [4] on one of the \xef\xac\x81rst Landsat 1 images\nrecorded in July 1972. Navalgund et al. [5] classi\xef\xac\x81ed the current\nremote sensing applications into the following categories: sustainable agriculture, water security, environmental assessment and\nmonitoring, disaster monitoring and mitigation, and infrastructure\ndevelopment. Other \xef\xac\x81elds of research such as \xef\xac\x81sheries management, weather and climate studies have also bene\xef\xac\x81ted from the\ndevelopment of the remote sensing sector [5]. More recently,\nremote sensing data have more been instrumental in advancing the\n\xef\xac\x81elds of ecology, biodiversity and conservation [6].\nAs environmental impacts of human activity make resource\nmanagement more and more complex and as, at the same time, our\nunderstanding of complex natural processes increases, our need for\ncritical information layers at appropriate spatial and temporal\nscales and extents increases too [2]. The growing number of themespeci\xef\xac\x81c satellites, noted by Navalgund et al. [5], re\xef\xac\x82ects a technological response that can help to overcome such limitations,\nthereby facilitating natural resource management.\nThe relevance of such spaceborne theme-speci\xef\xac\x81c missions can\nbe taken as a given from the measurement point of view. However,\nthe premise that spaceborne observation can best provide information for sustainable management of Earth resources should be\nsubjected to more critical debate. Indeed the sustainability of Earth\nobservation from space is not as evident as it might seem, a point\nthat is seldom discussed.\nThe paper, which is partially based on a previous work [7] aims\nto take a fresh look at measurement processes designed to support\nthe monitoring of Earth resources and to promote debate about the\nrole of remote sensing from space within the context of sustainable\nmanagement of these resources. Sustainability is de\xef\xac\x81ned as the\ncapacity to endure, and sustainable development as \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment\nthat meets the needs of the present without compromising the\nability of future generations to meet their own needs\xe2\x80\x9d [8]. In this\npaper, we look at Earth observation sustainability from two\ndifferent directions. First, given the number of space launches to\ndate, the amount of space debris currently in orbit, and the expected number of future launches, can we safely assume access to\norbit for operational environmental missions in the future? Second,\ngiven a full accounting of the environmental costs associated with\nspace launches, are satellites necessarily the best way to sustain the\n\xef\xac\x82ow of measurements needed to monitor the status of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nenvironment?\nThe common thread of this paper is the idea that to increase\nef\xef\xac\x81ciency and durability of observation and measurement systems\ndesigned to support sustainable management of the Earth\n\nresources, those measurement and monitoring systems should,\nthemselves, be as sustainable as possible. In short, this means that\nthe environmental, social, and economic cost of a mission must be\nless than the corresponding returns. Referring to ecological engineering principles [9,10], environmental impacts from the system\nproduction stage to its end of life should be better understood and\ntaken into account. This would enable the design of measurement\nsystems capable of providing valuable information for managers\nwhile minimizing their inevitable environmental impacts. Forgetting to limit those impacts when designing an observation system\nis liable to lead to suboptimal or even inappropriate solutions.\nSection 2 examines two issues that challenge the assumption\nthat spaceborne Earth observation systems are sustainable. Section\n2.1 calls into question the basic assumption that Earth-orbiting\nplatforms will always be available to the civilian remote sensing\ncommunity. Section 2.2 focuses on the environmental impacts of\nspace activity on the Earth and reports on how these impacts affect\nsustainability. Section 3 presents some unconventional points of\nview that, in our opinion, are required to address the sustainability\nissue of space-based Earth observation systems. In this section we\nalso suggest using environmental life cycle assessment as an\nanalysis tool that might be particularly relevant to help reaching\nthese goals. Section 4 details possible initiatives that follow naturally if these non-traditional points of view are deemed valid and\nthat might be taken to mitigate impacts associated with space\nmissions and improve sustainability of Earth observation systems.\nWe addressed some issues that are common to all remote sensing\nmissions. In addition a study case was chosen, i.e. vegetation lidar\nmissions, to illustrate a few case-speci\xef\xac\x81c possible actions. Section 5\nsummarizes and concludes.\n2. What can put the sustainability of Earth observation from\nspace in jeopardy?\nIn what follows, sustainability is considered with respect to\ndurability, space debris, and with respect to space activity as an\nEarth pollution source.\n2.1. Uncertainties about the durability of Earth observation from\nspace\n2.1.1. Historical context, current state and outlook for space activity\nThe development of the space sector began in 1957 with the\nlaunch of Sputnik, the \xef\xac\x81rst arti\xef\xac\x81cial, Earth-orbiting satellite. The\ntotal number of launches since 1957 exceeded 5000 during year\n2009 (see Fig. 1) and the mean annual number of launches over the\nten last years has been slightly higher than 65 [11]. Even though the\nnumber of launches per year have trended downward since the end\nof the cold war in 1991 (Fig. 1), the total number of operational\nsatellites has continually increased due to a rise in both the lifetime and mean number of satellites per launch.\nThe development of space activities has long been driven by the\npolitical and military aspirations of the USA and Russia, the two\nmain players in this sector. One of the peace dividends from the end\nof the cold war was the rise in commercially viable applications e\ne.g. telecommunication and Earth observation e and the emergence of new space powers, which led to the whole-scale transformation of the space sector. This transformation affected space\nprograms but also space activity architecture as a whole, affecting\nboth military and civilian applications [12], paving the way for the\nemergence of new features which are speci\xef\xac\x81c to the current set of\nactive satellites. There are currently close to 1000 active satellites in\norbit, operated by 41 countries and several international consortiums [13]. Fig. 2a and b shows the distribution of satellites according to orbit classes and scienti\xef\xac\x81c/commercial disciplines,\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Durrieu S, Nelson RF, Earth observation from space e The issue of environmental sustainability, Space Policy\n(2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.07.003\n\nS.

It\ncan be assumed that all these factors will result in an ongoing increase in the number of active satellites.\n2.1.2. Space debris and threats to future orbital activities\nSpace development has resulted in an increase in the amount of\nspace debris to such an extent that orbital debris is currently a\nthreat to spacecraft health and safety [14]. Space debris is made up\nof non-functional satellites (23%), upper stages of launchers (18%),\nfunctional debris (14%), e.g. bolts, belts, and fragments (45%) originating from collisions, launcher upper stages and spacecraft explosions. The current number of catalogued objects, i.e. objects\nlarger than 5e10 cm at Low Earth Orbit (LEO) altitudes and 30e\n100 cm at Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO) altitudes, which are tracked\nby the US Space Surveillance Network, is about 16 000 and is\nincreasing by several hundreds per year [14,15]. Estimations of noncatalogued objects vary depending on the source. According to the\nFrench Space Agency (CNES) estimates, there are roughly\nw200 000 objects with sizes ranging between 1 and 10 cm and\nw35 million of between 0.1 and 1 cm [16].\nMost objects making up orbital debris populations, and around\n40% of debris greater than 1 mm in size, is located in LEO [16] (see\nFig. 3). LEO space debris mitigation is a critical issue for space activity sustainability. Up to now four accidental collision events have\nalready been recorded [16] along with three other suspected collisions [17]. A collision between a satellite and a piece of debris\nlarger than 10 cm would lead to loss or explosion of the satellite. To\nprevent collisions involving catalogued debris, alert systems for\nhigh-risk conjunction events have been developed by space\nagencies, permitting them to implement avoidance manoeuvres\nwhen necessary [14,17]. Non-catalogued debris ranging from 1 to\n10 cm can also generate very signi\xef\xac\x81cant damage due to their kinetic\nenergy but the collision risk can only be studied statistically\nthrough analysis of impacts on dedicated experimental platforms\nor on launchers and large space debris that return to the Earth\nsurface. Table 1 reports collision probabilities. These probabilities\nare a function of particle \xef\xac\x82ux, which, in turn, depends on altitude,\nvehicle surface area and time spent in orbit.\nA simulation model of LEO predicted that, even with no future\nlaunches, the critical tipping point where the population of arti\xef\xac\x81cial\nspace debris would grow at a faster rate than the natural decay rate\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Durrieu S, Nelson RF, Earth observation from space e The issue of environmental sustainability, Space Policy\n(2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.07.003\n\n4\n\nS.

The eventuality that LEO\ncould be rendered inaccessible by a chain reaction of debris collisions e perhaps for thousands of years e is underlined by several\nauthors [18e21]. In this context, the successful Chinese FengYun 1C\nanti-satellite weapon test in 2007, which signi\xef\xac\x81cantly increased the\nprobability of collision, has been widely condemned [18,22].\n2.2. Space activity as a source of pollution contributing to the\ndeterioration of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s environment\nThe risks linked to space activities that are most frequently\ndiscussed in the popular literature are on-orbit collision risks,\nwhich threaten the commercial exploitation of space, and risks to\npeople on the ground during debris re-entry. We will discuss now a\ntopic which has seldom been addressed: the role of space activities\nas a source of pollution for the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s environment. We will focus\non environmental impacts that are related to launch, life on-orbit,\nand end-of-life stages.\n2.2.1. Environmental impacts during launch and orbit insertion\nThe launch stage is responsible for two main kinds of pollution.\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst one is the immediate return-to-Earth of the accelerator\nstage which separates from the launcher after fuel exhaustion. The\naccelerator stages are not systematically salvaged and seldom\nreused. To give an idea of the material quantity that can return to\nEarth, the two empty accelerators of Ariane 5 (mainly composed of\nsteel) weigh about 38 tons each. The second source of pollution is\nrelated to propulsion system functioning. Most spacecrafts depend\non a rocket engine for propulsion. Approximate emission levels for\nthe main propellant types are given in Table 2.\n\nTable 1\nProbability of collision over one year according to debris size for a satellite with a\n20 m2 surface area at an orbital altitude similar to SPOT, i.e. 825 km.

It is the case for example at the French Guiana Space\nCenter (CSG). At each launch, about 600 measurements are taken at\nseveral distances from the launch zone and include concentration\nmeasurements of hydrochloric acid, nitrogen dioxide, hydrazine\nand alumina. These measurements show that impacts are mainly\ncon\xef\xac\x81ned to the vicinity of the launch area (<2.3 km) where high\nlevels of HCl and Alumina concentrations have been recorded (see\nTable 3).\nImpacts were found to be low at intermediate distances (up to\n8 km) and non-signi\xef\xac\x81cant beyond. Impacts on water quality,\nvegetation and fauna are also monitored and up to now no significant negative impact has been noted [23]. In order to minimize\nlocal environmental impacts caused by Space activities, the Guiana\nSpace Centre (CSG) also pays particular attention to both the\ntransport and storage of substances for launcher and satellite propulsion. Filling procedures are also carefully monitored; substances\nwhich escape during launcher and satellite \xef\xac\x81lling procedures are\ntrapped and neutralized (http://www.cnes-csg.fr/web/CNES-CSGen [23],).\nBesides transient changes near the launch site, which affect the\nlowermost troposphere, emissions, albeit small, may cause lasting\nglobal changes in the stratosphere. As in the case of aircraft,\nspacecraft rocket emissions include greenhouse gases that directly\nadd to radiative forcing and warming, such as CO2, and compounds\nthat indirectly contribute to production or loss of greenhouse gases\nsuch as ozone and methane [24]. Furthermore, water vapour and\nsoot, which are components of condensation trails, are also\nresponsible for positive radiative forcing and contribute to warming [25]. The amount of emitted gases is trivial compared to other\nsources. For example annual CO2 emissions are estimated to be\nseveral kilotons compared to emissions of several hundred kilotons\nfrom aircraft, which, in turn, accounts for between 2 and 3% of the\ntotal emissions from all activities [24e26].\n\nTable 3\nExample of maximal concentrations of HCL and alumina measured during an Ariane\n5 launch (\xef\xac\x82ight 185, August 24, 2008).

Durrieu, R.F. Nelson / Space Policy xxx (2013) 1e13\n\nHowever, rocket combustion products are the only humanproduced pollutants injected directly into the middle and upper\nstratosphere. Up to now, few authors have studied phenomena\noccurring in higher atmospheric strata associated with rocket\nemissions. Impacts of emissions in the stratosphere are liable to be\nmore important than impacts of emissions occurring in the\ntroposphere. First, atmospheric circulation in the stratosphere is\ncharacterized by faster horizontal mixing of gases. Thus emissions\nwill spread throughout the stratosphere layer and will be longer\nlasting [24]. Second, the speci\xef\xac\x81c composition of the stratosphere\nwill give rise to speci\xef\xac\x81c reactions. The stratosphere includes the\nmajor part of the ozone layer and is characterized by a low water\nvapour concentrations. Indeed, atmospheric water vapour concentration decreases with altitude and over 99% of water vapour\nlies within the troposphere. While climate response seems to be\nindependent of where CO2 emissions occur (http://www.\nco2offsetresearch.org/aviation/DirectEmissions.html), the increase\nin forcing due to water vapour emissions in the stratosphere is\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cant compared to a similar water vapour emission in the\ntroposphere [25]. Emitted compounds also contribute to ozone\ndepletion in several ways. Some of these substances are highly\nreactive radicals e NOx, HOx, ClOx e that are directly involved in\ncatalytic cycles, thus leading to an increase in the ozone removal\nrate. As catalysts, they can have huge impacts even if present in only\ntrace amounts. A single radical molecule can destroy up to 105\nozone molecules before being deactivated e for example through\nreactions that remove radicals from the cycle by forming reservoir\nspecies e and transported out of the stratosphere. Other emitted\ncompounds contribute to an increase in tropospheric radical reservoirs. For example, particles such as alumina and, possibly soot\nparticles, are responsible for the liberation of radicals from the\nradical reservoirs present in the stratosphere. Concerning solid\nrocket motors, emitted HCl is in itself a radical reservoir. Furthermore, while water vapour emissions are widely considered inert,\nH2O, which is emitted by all rocket engines, is the source gas for\nHOx radicals and contributes to the formation of ice particles also\nresponsible for ozone loss. Ozone loss linked to water vapour is\nhighly nonlinear and dif\xef\xac\x81cult to predict [24]. The ozone layer is\nprotected by international agreements that limit the production of\nsubstances causing ozone depletion (i.e. the Montreal Protocol on\nSubstances That Deplete the Ozone Layer). Ross et al. [24]\ndemonstrated that if the Space Shuttle had met its original goal\nof weekly launches it would have been responsible for an ozone\nloss close to a quantity that Ross et al. [24] deemed to be the upper\nlimit acceptable to the international community that established\nthe Montreal protocol to protect the stratospheric ozone layer, even\nwhen taking into account the unique contribution of space activity.\n2.2.2. Environmental impacts during on-orbit life\nSeveral compounds are also released in the upper atmospheric\nlayers during the on-orbit lifetime of LEO satellites. First, the atmospheric drag in LEO causes orbital decay and the platform has to\nbe repositioned occasionally. This is usually performed using\nnozzle-based systems, and hydrazine is the most favoured monopropellant. The highly exothermic catalytic decomposition of hydrazine produces jets of hot gas and thus thrust. The emitted gas is\ncomposed of ammonia (NH3), hydrogen (H2) and nitrogen (N2).\nSecond, the presence of a diffuse atmosphere slowly erodes satellite\nplatforms. Atomic oxygen, the predominant component in the LEO\natmosphere, is responsible for the degradation of thermal, mechanical, and optical properties of exposed materials [27]. It interacts with hydrocarbon polymers (e.g. Kapton, Te\xef\xac\x82on, Mylar.)\nthat are used to thermally insulate and protect parts of the satellite.\nIn a recent study, Banks et al. (2011) [28] developed a model to\nassess the oxygen erosion yield according to the molecular\n\n5\n\ncharacteristics of several polymers. The experimental data they\nused shows that erosion yields (expressed as the volume lost per\nincident atomic oxygen atom in cm3/atom) vary from a factor of\nabout 90 between the most and least resistant polymers. According\nto these results Kapton, a commonly used spacecraft material, is a\nmoderately resistant polymer. Important Kapton mass losses have\nalready been observed, e.g. up to 35% reported by NASA on the STS3\nshuttle mission [29]. Even if this announced rate is open to discussion due to possible inconsistency in dehydratation states between pre- and post-\xef\xac\x82ight mass measurements [28] the above\nmentioned studies demonstrate that a signi\xef\xac\x81cant portion of the\ninsulation materials used to protect the satellites can be released\ninto the LEO domain in the form of volatile oxidation products.\n2.2.3. Environmental impacts associated with satellite end-of-life\nThe on-orbit lifetime of non-active satellites and other debris\ndepends on the presence and density of the terrestrial atmosphere.\nAtmospheric density decreases the greater the distance from the\nEarth but, at a given altitude, it also varies as a function of several\nfactors including solar activity and latitude. Atmospheric drag\nslows down orbiting objects, leading to their return to Earth within\na time period that depends on the orbit altitude (e.g. ISS lifetime\norbiting at 300e400 km would be w6 months to 1 year, SPOT\nlifetime orbiting at 825 km e about 200 years) [16]. During atmospheric re-entry objects are intensively heated and part of the\nmaterial is sublimated, thus slightly changing atmosphere\ncomposition, though probably with insigni\xef\xac\x81cant impact. Large\npieces of debris can also return to Earth. On average a piece of large\norbital debris (radar cross-section > 1 m2) falls back to Earth once\nor twice a week. Most of them (>70%) will impact water bodies\n[30]. Casualty risks are more closely associated to natural reentries, including premature ones as in the case of launch failure.\nLaunch failure rates reported for the April 2009eSeptember 2009\nperiod was one failure for every 39 launches [31]. Casualty risks are\ncurrently estimated to be lower than the risk associated with\nmeteorite impacts [16]. However both controlled and natural reentries are a potential source of orbital debris returning to Earth.\nFor instance, during the controlled Mir re-entry, while the initial\nmass in orbit was around 140 tons, 30 tons of debris fell into the\nPaci\xef\xac\x81c Ocean [16].\nThe re-entry of Phobos-Grunt is a recent example of accidental\nre-entry. The main objective of this Russian mission was to study\nPhobos, one of the moons of Mars. The satellite was launched in\nNovember 2011 but the spacecraft failed to exit the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s orbit\nand fell into the Paci\xef\xac\x81c Ocean on January 15, 2012. Onboard, there\nremained about 11 tons of unused highly toxic propellant: the\nunsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH). Fuel tanks are likely to\nhave exploded high above the Earth and some experts suggested\nthat the propellant was burnt. However other experts think that\npart of the material that vaporized could have re-condensed into\nsmall particles that may remain in the upper atmosphere for many\nyears and in\xef\xac\x82uence, even if in a minor way, atmospheric chemistry\n(http://www.space.com).\nThe re-entry of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS)\nin September 2011 is another recent example of uncontrolled\nnatural re-entry, but one which occurred after the satellite had\nceased its scienti\xef\xac\x81c life in 2005. NASA estimated that twenty-six\nsatellite components, weighing a total of more than 500 kg, may\nhave reached the Earth surface (http://www.nasa.gov).\nAnother environmental threat from space activities comes from\nthe use of nuclear reactors. Such reactors generate substantial\namounts of electrical power. Their use on military satellites is behind\nthe increased spatial resolving power of on-board radars and does\naway with the need for large solar sails. Decreasing the satellite\ncross-sectional area is paramount, thereby making localization more\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Durrieu S, Nelson RF, Earth observation from space e The issue of environmental sustainability, Space Policy\n(2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.07.003\n\n6\n\nS.

The radioisotope thermoelectric generators\nhave also enabled missions such as the Apollo Lunar surface experiments and interplanetary missions that require travel to areas\nwhere sunlight intensity and temperatures are low and where radiation belts are very severe [33]. Since 1961, the United States and\nthe former Soviet Union have \xef\xac\x82own at least 43 radioisotope thermoelectric generators and 36 nuclear reactors to provide power for\nrespectively 24 US and 37 Soviet single or multiple reactor space\nsystems [33]. Several nuclear-powered space vehicles are known to\nhave fallen to Earth, e.g. Transit in 1964 or Cosmos-954 in 1978, and\nwere responsible for the release of radioactive elements in the atmosphere and on the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface [32]. Current knowledge makes\nit very dif\xef\xac\x81cult to assess environmental impacts and the amount of\nradioactivity that would reach the Earth surface in case of the\ndisintegration of a reactor core, in particular in the upper atmosphere, during accidental re-entry [32].\nIn Section 2.2, we have only discussed environmental impacts\nfrom launch to satellite end-of-life. During launches and re-entries\nchemical components and debris are released in all atmospheric\nlayers and part of them falls back to Earth. Based on current\nknowledge we can only say that, due to its speci\xef\xac\x81c characteristics,\nspace activity is a source of casualty risk and also contributes to Earth\npollution with a pollution capacity dif\xef\xac\x81cult to assess but with\npotentially high risks. But for many manufactured products a signi\xef\xac\x81cant portion of the environmental impact is not directly linked to\nproduct use but rather to its manufacture and transport [34].\nTherefore, impacts associated with launcher, platform and instrument manufacturing, and those impacts related to the functioning of\nthe ground segment should also be carefully examined. Unfortunately these impacts have not been studied until now and we found\nno study report or paper dealing with this topic. The only actions we\ncould identify in order to \xef\xac\x81ll this gap are those recently initiated by\nthe European Space Agency, ESA, within the frame of the Clean Space\ninitiative [35]. First results should be available soon.\n\n3. Toward sustainable Earth observation systems\nRemote sensing scientists view satellite data acquisition as the\n\xef\xac\x81rst step in an information stream that ultimately leads to informative products, decisions and actions based on those products,\nadditional questions stemming from recent research, and perhaps\nfollow-on missions to address the most important outstanding\nquestions. However, prior to the acquisition of the \xef\xac\x81rst byte of data,\nconsideration should be given, to uncertainties associated with the\ndurability of Earth observation from space and a lack of knowledge\non the consequences of space activities on the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s environment.\nAlso, in keeping with the transparency1 quality of a measuring\ninstrument, as a community, we should do our best to ensure that\nthe methods used to observe and measure the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s environment\ninterfere least with that environment. For example, when measurements are acquired to assess carbon pools and \xef\xac\x82uxes, with the\naim of better understanding the carbon cycle and climate change,\nthe measuring system should contribute as little as possible to the\nglobal carbon cycle.\nWe suggest points of view that, if shared, naturally lead to\nconsideration of questions concerning the environmental sustainability of Earth observation systems.\n\n1\nIn the \xef\xac\x81eld of Metrology and Units of Measure, transparency is the ability of a\nmeasuring instrument not to alter the measurand e term and de\xef\xac\x81nition approved\nby ISO, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), the International\nElectrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Organization of Legal\nMetrology (OIML).\n\n3.1. Integrating environmental considerations when designing\nsystems\nFirst we should shift from a view where systems are designed to\nmeet measurement objectives that consider primarily economic\nand technical constraints, to a more holistic view that considers an\nindividual system as a contributor to the whole satellite set and that\nincludes consideration of interactions between remote sensing\nsystems and the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s environment, including environmental\nimpacts from the system production stage to its end of life. This\nwould enable the design of measurement systems capable of\nproviding valuable information for sustainable management of the\nEarth resources while reducing to a minimum their inevitable\nenvironmental impact. This would thus help remove the contradiction that currently exists between the environmental impact of\nspace activities and the purpose of the Earth remote sensing\nmission, which is to assist sustainable management of the planet.\nBut this would also require major and challenging changes.\nAcquisition processes are currently designed based on usual\nmeasurement quality criteria, e.g. degrees of precision and of accuracy, and are mainly determined by economic costs, technological readiness levels, and technical constraints. A perspective that\nconsiders sustainability would also include environmental and\nsocial dimensions. As the environment underpins both society and\nthe economy [36], an essential step in designing measurement\nprocesses that respect sustainability principles is to integrate\nenvironmental dimension when evaluating the data acquisition\nprocess as regards sensor performance and data quality. For\ninstance, should a country spend $1 billion on its own space radar\nto ensure control of the data if better or similar data could be acquired less expensively by (1) cooperating with international\npartners or (2) utilizing aircraft radar systems to better effect? The\ncorrect answer to this question becomes even more obvious if\nenvironmental concerns are taken into account, though such\ntreatment excludes more ambiguous though important concerns\nsuch as national pride and maintenance of technological readiness.\nTools designed to assess environmental impacts exist and could\nbe used at several levels to better take into account environmental\nconcerns in the evaluation of Earth observation data and products\nsupply chain. Le Pellec-Dairon [37] proposed a novel approach to\nbetter assess the environmental value of Earth observation data.\nThis approach requires one to evaluate the economic value of\nenvironmental goods and to move from this value to the value of\nEarth observation data that are used to improve Earth resource\nmanagement. Certainly, assigning an economic value to an environmental good can be challenging, possibly subjective and probably arguable. As with any qualitative versus economic comparison,\none central issue becomes assigning a defensible monetary value\nto, for instance, a vista, a hiking path, a clean river, or, in the case of\nsatellite missions, closure of the global carbon budget, a 10% increase in the precision of a biomass estimate, or a more accurate\nmap of deforestation. That said, Le Pellec-Dairon [37] developed\nsuch an approach to help improve the ef\xef\xac\x81ciency of the strategy for\nEarth observation mission management and to select the missions\nwith the largest positive effects, including economical, political,\ntechnical and environmental values. However, the proposed\napproach only considers the total economic value of the environmental information supplied by Earth resources missions and will\nremain incomplete while this value is not weighed against the\neconomic value of environmental degradation due to the manufacture, launch, on-orbit maintenance, and eventual destruction of\nthe mission hardware.\nWe think that using tools such as environmental LCA can be an\neffective way to assess environmental impacts of space activity and\nto improve sustainability of Earth observation systems and thus\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Durrieu S, Nelson RF, Earth observation from space e The issue of environmental sustainability, Space Policy\n(2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.07.003\n\nS. Durrieu, R.F. Nelson / Space Policy xxx (2013) 1e13\n\nincrease ef\xef\xac\x81ciency and environmental value of the Earth data\nproduction chain. Environmental LCA methods and procedures\nhave already been standardized (ISO 14040 and ISO 14044). LCA are\nmulti-criteria, quantitative approaches that enable assessment of\nenvironmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product\xe2\x80\x99s\nlife from-cradle-to-grave (i.e. from raw material extraction through\nmaterials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and\nmaintenance, and disposal or recycling) [34]. Environmental impacts are assessed through either midpoint or endpoint indicators\nderived from the inventory of \xef\xac\x82uxes of both raw materials and\npollutants. Ozone depletion, climate change (in practice all the\ngreenhouses gazes emissions are transformed into an equivalent of\nemitted CO2 according to their warming capacity and taking into\naccount their lifetime), land use change, acidi\xef\xac\x81cation, nutriphication, natural resources depletion (such as minerals, fossil fuel.) are\nexamples of indicators provided by LCA, when a midpoint impact\ncategory, or problem-oriented approach, is chosen. Impacts are\ntranslated into environmental themes. Endpoint modelling, also\ncalled damage-oriented approach, can also be used but is considered more uncertain. Indeed endpoint impacts result from the\ncombination and the transformation of midpoint environmental\nimpacts into issues of concern such as damages on human health\n(e.g. number of cancers), on ecosystems (e.g. loss of habitats), on\nnatural resources.\nWe suggest that environmental LCA methods and mid-point\nimpact indicators be considered as one of a number of tools and\nmetrics that could be employed to facilitate, for instance, comparisons between different mission scenarios or to optimize a given\nmission. In addition to improving the coherence between the data\nacquisition step and the end goals of some space missions, it can be\nargued that acting to develop a space activity with reduced environmental impacts on both Earth and space has advantages for\nspace sector. ESA has adopted a pioneer position in this area with its\nClean Space initiative [35] and, among the arguments put forward\nto justify this initiative, some are worth highlighting:\n- Laws evolve, and the space community should expect environmental law to eventually address space-related activities,\nespecially those having to do with launch and space debris. The\ndevelopment of eco-friendly space policies and programs is\none way to proactively address legal evolutions that are liable\nto lead to disruption of classical space-quali\xef\xac\x81ed materials and\nprocesses. Among candidate green technologies are development of green propellants to replace hydrazine or other toxic\nliquid propellants, replacement of chromates used for surface\ncoating and bonding, green electronics, and reductions in bulk\nmachining that are sources of raw material waste. Hydrazine\nhas already been included in the list of substances of very high\nconcern by the European Community Regulation on chemicals\nand their safe use that deals with the Registration, Evaluation,\nAuthorization and Restriction of Chemical substances (REACH).\n- By acting proactively, ESA expects to be well positioned to help\nshape future laws, thereby making it easier to comply with\nfuture regulations.\n- The act of encouraging industrialists to develop and adopt ecodesigns and eco-technologies promotes innovation and is thus\nan ef\xef\xac\x81cient way to make industry more competitive in world\nmarkets.\n\n3.2. The bene\xef\xac\x81ts of changing our relationship with statistics\nSecondly, with regards to environmental risk management, it\nwould be necessary to shift from minimizing Type-I error, i.e. rejecting\nthe null hypothesis (or status-quo) when it is true, to reducing Type-II\n\n7\n\nerror, i.e. reducing the chance of accepting the null hypothesis when it\nis false [9]. Usual scienti\xef\xac\x81c approaches tend to minimize Type-I error.\nThis allows us to achieve high levels of con\xef\xac\x81dence in the decision in\norder to reject a null hypothesis and accept that some sort of change\nhas occurred or that a \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d condition exists. When applied to environmental management, minimizing Type I error means that we need\nto be virtually-certain that environmental or ecological damage has\noccurred (due to space activity in our case) before we would accept the\nalternative hypothesis [9]. The net effect of relying on such an\napproach e when determining if and what actions must be taken e is\nthat the damage would have already been done by the time the test\nalerts us of the need to act. With respect to prevention, mitigation, or\nremediation, this course of action is counterproductive. In order to\ncalculate Type II error, the analyst would have to de\xef\xac\x81ne an alternative\nhypothesis, i.e. that condition beyond which intolerable damage\nwould be done or a tipping point is reached. Such an alternative could\ntake the form of a chemical concentration at a particular altitude, a\nradiation level, or a collision probability. Furthermore, for lowprobability high-impact events e e.g. LEO becomes inaccessible for\nhundreds of years e Taleb et al. [38], who analysed common errors in\nthe way risks are managed, maintain that it is more ef\xef\xac\x81cient to reduce\nthe impact of threats we cannot control rather than to focus on statistical predictions of such events. This is why, the development of\nspace debris mitigation and removal technologies like those considered by ESA in the context of its Clean Space program are essential.\nDebris mitigation/removal research complements research conducted\nto collect information on small debris, i.e. those objects not detected\nwith current methods, and to model the behaviour of the space debris\nenvironment [35]. Innovation in this area can also have spin-off bene\xef\xac\x81ts for the space industry sector allowing an early positioning on\nemerging markets that might replace part of the space sector traditional markets if a stronger regulation of the use of space became\neffective.\n3.3. Revisiting common ideas in the remote sensing and space\nactivity sectors\nIt would be useful to qualify three commonly held arguments\nfor remote sensing data that are taken as a given. First, from a\nstrictly economical point of view, space remote sensing is considered cost effective for end-users, especially given that much of the\ndata are freely available, e.g. Landsat, MODIS. But this statement\ndoes not take into account all national funding invested in space\nactivity. Consideration of the full range of expenditures might\nindicate that, for certain space missions, airborne solutions may be\nmore viable and may provide better data from the standpoint of\nseasonality, spatial coverage, and higher radiometric and spatial\nquality at a lower cost. This is especially true when the mission\nobjective addresses national or regional concerns rather than\ncontinental or global concerns. Second, \xef\xac\x81eld data are often\ndescribed as being costly and time consuming [39] and in many\ninstances this common idea is correct. In south-eastern Alaska, for\ninstance, the cost of establishing and measuring one US Forest\nService \xef\xac\x81eld plot in 2013 is estimated to be $9000 USD. That said,\nsuch costs should not imply that remote sensing data, sometimes\n\xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d, can replace \xef\xac\x81eld observations. Field measurements are\nessential for calibration/validation steps in most remote sensing\ndata processing approaches, and also provide information that\ncannot be acquired by other means, e.g. assessment of local biodiversity, soil properties, presence/absence of rare species, estimates\nof downed woody debris, regeneration. Remote sensing will never\nreplace the need to make \xef\xac\x81eld measurements and maintaining\nsuf\xef\xac\x81cient \xef\xac\x81eld observation networks and \xef\xac\x81eld expertise remains\nessential. Third, it is worth noting that, for the space activity sector,\nany object (satellite, piece of launcher.) is considered as recycled\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Durrieu S, Nelson RF, Earth observation from space e The issue of environmental sustainability, Space Policy\n(2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.07.003\n\n8\n\nS.

This is very remote from the\nnotion of recycling in the context of sustainable development. The\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to sequester human waste is limited [36] and\nrecycling aims to reduce waste. Furthermore a part of so-called\n\xe2\x80\x9crecycled\xe2\x80\x9d spacecraft is in reality composed of pollutants emitted\ninto the atmosphere or deposited on the ground.\n4. Potential measures to improve environmental\nsustainability of Earth observation systems\nEmbracing the unconventional points of view presented in the\nprevious section leads to suggestions on suitable actions that could\nhelp to design more ef\xef\xac\x81cient Earth observation systems and networks.\nIn order to illustrate some of the suggested actions we will rely\non a study case: the design of lidar systems for forest monitoring.\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst sub-section presents this study case and sets out the\ngeneral context, the required data on sustainable management of\nforests, and some spaceborne solutions that have been under study.\nThe second subsection suggests some measures that might be\nadopted when planning an Earth observation space mission. In the\nthird subsection the scope of the discussion is extended to incorporate airborne missions in an Earth observation network.\n4.1. Study case: lidar, a valuable technology to improve sustainable\nmanagement of forest ecosystems\nWhile sustainable management of forests is recognized to be\ncrucial for the future of mankind, forest ecosystems are heavily\nimpacted by climate change, natural hazards and anthropogenic\npressures, particularly deforestation and degradation. Over the last\ndecade, about 13 million hectares (0.33% of total forested area)\nwere converted to other uses or lost through natural causes each\nyear [40]. Robust systems for measuring, assessing, and reporting\nkey forest parameters, e.g. biomass, carbon, must be developed in\norder to de\xef\xac\x81ne appropriate management practices and policies to\naddress the challenge of sustainable management of forest resources and to strengthen forest-based climate change mitigation\nstrategies [41e44]. The utility of lidar has been widely demonstrated with respect to forest structure measurements and biomass\nestimation [45e54]. This is also the case in closed-canopy tropical\nareas supporting high biomass forests greater than 200 t ha\xc3\x801\n[55,56], where optical vegetation indices and volumetric radar\nmeasurements typically saturate [57].\nConsequently a spaceborne lidar that acquires vegetation height\nand canopy closure measurements, when employed as a global\nsampling tool e either alone or in combination with optical and\nradar imagery e and supported by ground observations would\nappear to be a promising solution to estimate aboveground forest\nbiomass and carbon at a global scale. Indeed such a solution would\ncombine the bene\xef\xac\x81cial measurement properties of spaceborne\nremote sensing, i.e. acquisition of global information that is\nconsistent both in space and time, with lidar technology. A detailed\nreview of measurement requirements for the assessment of\nbiomass, biomass change and carbon \xef\xac\x82ux, biodiversity and habitat,\nis provided by Hall et al. [58]. The authors identi\xef\xac\x81ed several requirements for lidar measurements which notably include the\nfollowing [58]:\n- global coverage of forested areas;\n- based on 25 m footprints, measurements, of forest height with\n1 m accuracy at zero slope, of forest vertical structure with a 1e\n2 m accuracy and of canopy cover measures accurate to within\n10%;\n\n- a spatial sampling in order to have a mean canopy height\nwithin 1e2 m for 1 ha and 1 km grid cells (50 cloud-free observations per 250 m grid cell would be required to achieve the\nrequired height accuracy at 250 m);\n- contiguously sampled pro\xef\xac\x81les for primarily ecological reasons,\ne.g. estimation of height correlation length scales and height\ndistributions, but also technical and practical ones, e.g. ground\n\xef\xac\x81nding and local structural context;\n- a temporal resolution enabling the production of two annual\nbiomass maps in order to capture seasonal variability and to\nmonitor annual biomass change and a minimum of a 5-year\nobservation period to capture the successional dynamics of\nforest ecosystems.\nICESat, an ice mission which collected data useful to terrestrial\nstudies from 2003 to late 2009, was the \xef\xac\x81rst spaceborne lidar\nsystem designed to measure terrestrial surfaces. Despite the icecentric design, several studies used ICESat/GLAS data to estimate\nforest structure and biomass at regional scales [56,59e64]. Lefsky\n[64], Simard et al. [65], and Los et al. [66] have demonstrated the\nglobal capabilities of space-based GLAS measurements while\nNelson [67] outlines some of the limitations associated with GLASbased biomass estimates. ICESat-2, scheduled for launch in 2016,\nwill be the second lidar mission dedicated to Earth surface monitoring. It is also primarily designed to characterize and monitor\npolar ice, and includes among its secondary scienti\xef\xac\x81c objectives\nmeasurement of vegetation canopy height as a basis for estimating\nlarge-scale biomass and biomass change [68]. However data simulations have demonstrated that ICESat-2, in its current design, will\nnot replace the recently shelved DESDynI vegetation lidar mission\n[69]. Even under ideal conditions e clear sky, night-time data\ncollect, minimal topography e we expect the ground signal to be\nlost at canopy closures exceeding w96%, thus making calculation of\ncanopy height problematic in closed-canopy forest growing in\nareas with appreciable local topography.\nScientists have designed and proposed to space agencies space\nlidar missions with forest measurement and monitoring as primary\nscienti\xef\xac\x81c objectives (e.g. VCL, LVTM, Carbon-3D, DESDynI-Lidar,\nLEAF, SpeCL. [69e74]). All proposals e US, ESA, and Japan e have\nthus far been unsuccessful; none have been launched. The Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) was selected in March 1997 by NASA as\nthe \xef\xac\x81rst Earth System Science Path\xef\xac\x81nder (ESSP) space\xef\xac\x82ight mission\nand was scheduled for launch in January 2000 [75]. The mission\nwas discontinued due to unexpected technical limitations that\nprecluded construction of the lasers within the initial quoted cost.\nThe reasons underlying the decision to discontinue the lidar part of\nthe DESDynI mission, a vegetation measurement and monitoring\nmission initially approved by NASA, are unknown even to scientists\nthat were directly involved in the project. It was cancelled by the US\ngovernment as an austerity measure, but we guess that it may have\nbeen jeopardized due to what was seen by budget or science\nmanagers as mission overlap with ICESat-2. With respect to ESA\xe2\x80\x99s\nLEAF project, the evaluators estimated that the mission was technically feasible but above budget (\xc3\xbe15% above the recommended\nindustrial ceiling cost). The evaluators acknowledged that the\nmission could have been complementary to the BIOMASS mission,\na P-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) also dedicated to biomass\nestimation that was selected as one of the three candidates for the\n7th Earth Explorer mission. The evaluation team also mentioned\nthe possible mission overlap between LEAF and ICESat2 or DESDynI, which was not yet discontinued when the LEAF project was\nsubmitted. The chosen revisit period, i.e. 3 years, and the fact that\nthe same individual laser pulse locations cannot be revisited were\nidenti\xef\xac\x81ed as shortcomings. SpeCL, a large footprint multifrequency lidar with the capacity to revisit previous spots, was\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Durrieu S, Nelson RF, Earth observation from space e The issue of environmental sustainability, Space Policy\n(2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.07.003\n\nS.

This may be interpreted as an additional evidence of the acknowledgement by ESA of\nthe scienti\xef\xac\x81c interest of vegetation space lidar missions, even if\nfrom a technological point of view revisiting previous spots is,\npractically speaking, currently not achievable in the civilian space\nsector.\nIn May 2013 BIOMASS radar mission was selected by the ESA\xe2\x80\x99s\nEarth Observation Programme Board to become the seventh Earth\nExplorer mission. However, while we have the bene\xef\xac\x81t of hindsight\nabout the capacity of lidar systems to provide valuable information\nfor biomass estimation, there are still uncertainties and open scienti\xef\xac\x81c questions about the potential of the BIOMASS system to\nprovide the expected information, in particular in forests with very\nhigh biomass levels. In 2011, several projects were submitted to\nNASA (GEDI project), JAXA (i-LOVE project), and ESA (GRAIL project) that would involve embedding on the International Space\nStation (ISS) either a vegetation lidar system or a blue and green\ncarbon system, i.e. a dual frequency lidar to assess biomass both on\nland and in oceans and coastal waters. These projects would\npartially replace the DESDynI lidar mission. Only the project submitted to the JAXA, renamed MOLI, is currently selected for further\nstudies. The project submitted to NASA was rejected despite the\nfact that the evaluation committee acknowledged its high scienti\xef\xac\x81c\nvalue [76]. In December 2012, the decision of non-selection for the\nGRAIL project was also communicated by the ESA to the principal\ninvestigator.\nConsidering this international context, we will rely on this\nexample to illustrate some of the actions that are suggested in the\nfollowing subsections in order to help to increase sustainability of\nEarth observation systems, with a focus on systems dedicated to\nforest biomass monitoring.\n4.2. Improving sustainability of space remote sensing\nDue to geopolitical constraints, satellite-based solutions seem to\nbe the only way that is currently available to acquire data globally.\nFurthermore they guarantee a higher data consistency than what\ncan be expected from airborne solutions that are managed at\nregional or national levels and also facilitate user access to data.\nHowever, when designing space missions, actions that are in\nkeeping with the above-mentioned considerations could be taken,\nthereby making them more compatible with environmental sustainability principles. Two main challenges hamper the sustainable\ndevelopment of space activity: space debris, which threaten the\nactivity itself, and the sector\xe2\x80\x99s potential negative impacts on both\nspace and Earth environments.\n4.2.1. Mitigation and remediation of space debris\nAccording to Williamson [77], ethical and code policy for space\nshould include protection of the various orbital zones surrounding\nthe Earth given their importance as a commercial and scienti\xef\xac\x81c\nresource by formalizing debris mitigation measures. Space\nagencies, e.g. CNES, ESA, NASA, have already developed guidelines\nto mitigate space debris. At an international level, the United Nations Committee for the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS)\nhas already taken a keen interest in space debris and in the use of\nnuclear energy in space. But, as a consultative body, it has no legislative power [21,77]. Bradley and Wein [18] demonstrated that\nachieving full compliance with the 25-year spacecraft deorbiting\nguidelines could maintain the lifetime risk from space debris at a\nsustainable level. Williamson [15] underlines that despite their\npotential ef\xef\xac\x81cacy, technological solutions to space sustainability\nwill not be effective without the development of international\npolicies and laws to support and promulgate them. He presents\nseveral initiatives and places for discussion and negotiations that\n\n9\n\ncould contribute to the establishment of such international policies\n[15]. However the consequences of heeding the advice from Taleb\netal. [38] concerning low-probability high-impact events would be\n1) to do everything in our power to reduce space junk by developing, for example, orbital debris removal operations as proposed\nby Weeden [20], 2) to do our utmost to mitigate future launch\npollution and debris, thereby keeping space as pristine as practically possible, and 3) to think about alternatives to spaceborne\nsolutions in case LEO becomes inaccessible.\nEven if it has a limited contribution to current space debris\nenvironment, ESA clearly expresses its willing to tackle questions\nconcerning space debris mitigation and remediation within the\nframe of its Clean Space program. Among the planned actions are\nthe following [35]:\n- for space-debris mitigation: develop compact, robust and\nautonomous systems for de-orbiting of spacecraft in LEO, develop end-of-life passivation of propulsive and power systems\nto lower the risk of spacecraft break-up, develop spacecraft\ndesigned to break-up during re-entry in such a way as to avoid\nlarge space debris impacting the Earth surface (\xe2\x80\x9cDesign for\nDemise\xe2\x80\x9d concept);\n- for space-debris remediation: develop hardware to approach,\ndock with, and control a spacecraft scheduled for de-orbit or\nsizeable debris soon to de-orbit so as to fully control reentry to\nassure the best environmental (and societal) outcome.\n4.2.2. Mitigation of environmental impacts\nTo better grasp this issue of damage related to space activity on\nthe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s environment, research is needed to assess the behaviour\nof materials released into the upper atmospheric layers by launch\nvehicles, fuels, and re-entry debris. A unique characteristic of space\nactivity is that it is the only human activity that releases elements\ninto the upper atmospheric layers where concentrations of natural\ncompounds are low. Consequently even the introduction of elements in small quantities can greatly affect atmospheric composition and chemistry; as evidenced by the effects of reactive radicals\non the ozone cycle [24]. Impacts of space activity on complex\nprocesses occurring in upper atmospheric layers have been little\nstudied until now and there is a clearly a lack of knowledge on the\npotential consequences of space activity on atmosphere composition and on radiative transfer.\nIn addition to site impact studies performed on industrial sites\n(e.g. launch site), environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) could\nbe used more generally to help quantify the environmental impacts\nof Earth observation systems and to identity critical stages where\nthese impacts might be mitigated. Environmental LCA could also be\nused to compare several mission scenarios and to help choose the\nscenario that will provide data meeting the information requirements speci\xef\xac\x81ed by scientists and end-users while leading to\nthe lowest environmental impact level.\nIn this \xef\xac\x81eld, ESA has adopted a pioneer position and has started\nusing LCA to study environmental impacts of a whole mission, from\nthe early research stages to the mission end-of-life, including all the\ntests required to check the system resistance to hostile space\nenvironment, i.e. high temperature gradients and radiation.\nConvinced of the bene\xef\xac\x81ts of green-technology development (see\nSection 3.1), one of ESA\xe2\x80\x99s objectives is to generalize the assessment\nof environmental impacts of space activity and to develop a\nframework, with databases and tools, dedicated to this activity that\ncould be used by European space agencies and industry [35]. A\npreliminary version of this LCA tool is currently being implemented\nto model environmental impacts of missions (launchers and satellites) representative of various application \xef\xac\x81elds [35]. First results\nwill be of great interest as it is the \xef\xac\x81rst study in this \xef\xac\x81eld.\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Durrieu S, Nelson RF, Earth observation from space e The issue of environmental sustainability, Space Policy\n(2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.07.003\n\n10\n\nS. Durrieu, R.F. Nelson / Space Policy xxx (2013) 1e13\n\nFurthermore, if we see each mission as an activity contributing\nto space activity as a whole and therefore as a contributor to the\nproblems discussed in this paper, very simple measures can be\nproposed to improve sustainability of space activity from this point\nforward. First, if we consider space as a limited resource we should\nstrive to use it parsimoniously and to launch a satellite embedding a\nmeasurement system only when a high level of con\xef\xac\x81dence on the\nsystem\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to meet measurement requirements has been\nreached. Second priority might be given to missions with longer\nlifetimes in order to reduce the number of launches, space debris,\nand to lessen environmental damage. Third, priority might also be\ngiven to international missions in order to reduce mission duplication, e.g. multiple X, C, L-band radars, multiple w30 m Landsatlike clones, or multiple satellite constellations embedding very\nhigh resolution imagers. Consideration should also be given to the\nuse of existing space infrastructure. For instance, the International\nSpace Station (ISS) hosts relatively short-lived (e.g. 2 year) systems\nthat allow instrument engineers to test, re\xef\xac\x81ne, and improve their\ninstrument designs and allow scientists to assess the utility of the\ndata products. These packages may truly be recycled since they\xe2\x80\x99re\ncarried to and from the ISS on cargo spacecraft and placed in\nexterior slots speci\xef\xac\x81cally designed for Earth remote sensing experiments. Further experiments could be conducted during the\nremaining lifetime of the ISS (current expectation, w10 years).\n4.2.3. Actions speci\xef\xac\x81c to the study case\nWhen scientists de\xef\xac\x81ne mission requirements they tend to\nfavour the acquisition of a maximum amount of data. For a vegetation lidar mission this is liable to reduce the mission life-time,\ngiven that laser life-time is typically driven by number of emitted\npulses rather than time in orbit. This is why, to optimize mission\nspeci\xef\xac\x81cations while adhering to the principles and recommendations that mitigate environmental impacts of the mission, we\nsuggest the following:\n- Identify the best trade-off between measurement contiguity\nand laser life-time considerations. The choice can then be made\nwhether to give priority to a longer lifetime and noncontiguous\nmeasurements or to contiguous measurements with a resulting shorter lifetime. Due to space activity sustainability issues,\nthe added value of contiguous lidar measurements should be\ncarefully examined. Currently, studies that involve regional\nbiomass or carbon assessments tend to treat satellite orbits as\nobservational units, i.e. clusters, rather than considering individual laser shots as separate observations (e.g. [59,62,63].\nSuch an approach precludes any need to account for alongtrack, within-orbit spatial autocorrelation. If laser lifetime is\nnot a concern, then contiguous, along-track measurements\nmake sense since spatial adjacency makes it easier to \xef\xac\x81nd and\ntrack ground while increasing the number of individual pulse\nobservations available to characterize a particular cover type or\nstratum. If laser lifetime is a limiting factor, then fewer shots\nspaced further apart would suf\xef\xac\x81ce.\n- Explore the lidar signal dynamic in forests to make sure that\nthe pulse characteristics are capable of supplying a signal from\nboth the ground and the forest canopy under a wide variety of\ncanopy conditions, from sparse to very dense. Analyses of\nICESat/GLAS data, a large-footprint waveform system, have\nhighlighted some limitations in forest height assessment in\ndense forests where an underestimation of height has been\nobserved (see e.g. [78]). Sparse forests challenge analysts processing GLAS data for a different reason; the canopy may be so\ndiffuse, e.g. high boreal forests, that no discernable canopy\nsignal is returned [67]. Shrublands present a third problem,\nthat being the fact that the signal from short-statured\n\nvegetation, though dense, may be convolved with the pulse\nwidth (ICESat/GLAS, 6 ns FWHM) such that waveforms from\n\xef\xac\x82at surfaces and waveforms from shrublands are essentially\nidentical. ICESat-2, a photon-counting, moderate footprint\n(10 m diameter) space lidar due for launch in 2016, may be\nunable to retrieve ground reliably under very dense forest\ncanopies that exceed 95e96% canopy closure. To be fair, ICESat2 is an ice mission that is expected to meet stringent performance criteria associated with measurement and monitoring\nof ice sheets, sea ice, and glaciers. Vegetation measurements\nare of secondary concern.\n- Evaluate the added-value created by coupling a very high\nspatial resolution multispectral imager with the lidar. Such an\nimager, if accurately boresighted, would provide contextual\nand geolocation information contemporaneous with the lidar\nacquisition that could help to improve both accuracy of inversion models used to estimate forest parameters from lidar data\nand extrapolation of biomass estimations. This coupling could\nthus help achieving the target level for biomass measurement\naccuracy with a reduced amount of lidar measurements\ncompared to what would be required without imager.\nHowever, while sustainability issues are not considered as\ncrucial, the model \xe2\x80\x9cmore data is better\xe2\x80\x9d is likely to last and priority\nis likely to be given by default to lidar missions providing higher\nmeasurement densities without studying the above mentioned\nissues and, thus, to the detriment of mission life-time.\nIf one of the projects submitted to embed a vegetation lidar\nonboard the International Space Station were approved, measurements of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s forests south of 51.6\x14 N over the lifespan of the\nISS would be available. There are several points which argue for\nsuch a solution. First, the operation of an ISS lidar would obviously\nbe physically and operationally supported by existing infrastructure. Second, the means to transport the lidar to the ISS and to\nservice the lidar while operating aboard the ISS would depend on a\ntransportation system that is already used to maintain the crew and\nstation. Third, as the ISS was originally conceived to promote international cooperation, we expect that the space agencies would\nbe willing to work together on an ISS lidar system, therefore sharing\nexperiences and costs and avoiding the development of multiple\nsatellite systems providing duplicated data. Lastly, while the system\nwould be designed to acquire ranging and possibly active spectral\nmeasurements on tropical and temperate forests, it would be a\ntechnology demonstrator from which lessons could be learned to\nprepare future space missions.\n\n4.3. The contribution of airborne missions to a more sustainable\nEarth observation network\n4.3.1. Comparing spaceborne and airborne missions to optimize\ntheir respective contributions\nThe rigid technical speci\xef\xac\x81cations associated with space technology and related industries might give rise to environmental\nimpacts during system manufacturing (for both the satellite and\nthe launcher), deployment, and operational phases that would be\ngreater than those associated with deployment of an aircraft system able to provide data that meet the same requirements. For a\ngiven mission, then, it would be worth checking to see if a space\nsystem is the best solution from an environmental viewpoint taking\ninto account, among other factors, data requirements, multipurpose uses of data, and number of satellites launched at the same\ntime by a given launcher. The results of a comprehensive,\ncomparative analysis are hardly predictable. To our knowledge, no\npaper has been published that indicate trends or that suggest\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Durrieu S, Nelson RF, Earth observation from space e The issue of environmental sustainability, Space Policy\n(2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.07.003\n\nS.

We believe that an LCA-like approach\nmight be the best way to combine the complementary available\nmeasurement processes to provide the data sets that will best meet\nthe data requirements in the context of minimizing environmental\nimpacts. Indeed they would facilitate the assessment and comparison of the several available measurement methods, i.e. spaceborne and airborne systems but also \xef\xac\x81eld campaigns, thereby\nproviding elements to determine the cost/bene\xef\xac\x81t trade off that\ntakes into account environmental aspects in addition to metrological and economic ones. Attempts to integrate social impacts\nmight also be considered using societal life cycle assessment (SLCA)\nmethodologies [80]. LCA could be used to help decide if priority\nshould be given (1) to series of short-lifetime satellites or ISS instruments acquiring dense lidar measurement samples, (2) to a\nlong lifetime satellite acquiring sparser measurement samples\ncompleted, where and when needed, using airborne systems to\nincrease sampling density in space or time, (3) or to the use of\nairborne systems alone.\n\nMoreover lidar lends itself well to the development of innovative and alternative solutions because even sampled measurements are highly relevant. Traditional lidar acquisitions with\ntopographic airborne systems are cost prohibitive, in particular for\ndeveloping countries. Developing low cost, light systems designed\nspeci\xef\xac\x81cally for forest resource assessment, e.g. PALS [81] or LAUVAC systems [82,83], might be one way to provide accurate forest\ninventory capacities to developing countries. By thinking \xe2\x80\x9coutside\nthe box\xe2\x80\x9d, could we embed light lidar systems on commercial jet\naircraft? This could diminish both cost and environmental impacts. In the study from Wilkerson et al. (2010) that analyses\nemission data from global commercial aviation, a map shows the\ntotal CO2eC (kg/m2) emitted for the year 2006 along the main\ncommercial aircraft lines. This map gives an idea of the distribution of the main commercial aircraft lines over the world and of\ncommercial traf\xef\xac\x81c density worldwide (Fig. 4). It can be seen that\nall terrestrial areas, except the Antarctic, are covered, albeit at\ngreatly varying \xef\xac\x82ight line densities. Handling such data sets acquired on these commercial routes would certainly be challenging\nfrom a statistical standpoint but might become an ef\xef\xac\x81cient and\nsolution.\n5. Conclusion\n\n4.3.2. The place of airborne missions for our study case\nConsidering our study case, exploring the place of airborne\nmissions in an observation network dedicated to forest and\nbiomass monitoring is particularly relevant. Indeed, in the current\ninternational context, two missions are likely to be launched with\nworldwide biomass measurements as a primary or secondary\nobjective, i.e. the BIOMASS radar mission and the ICESat2 lidar\nmission. Lidar and radar data are complementary and lidar ranging\ndata will be available, even if not optimized for vegetation, especially in very dense forests. While no vegetation lidar mission exists, it could be worth considering an airborne solution to complete\nmeasurements acquired by ICESat2, especially over dense forests,\nin order to improve global biomass estimations.\n\nWithout doubt, global data sets provided by the plethora of\nEarth remote sensing satellites have greatly improved our understanding of Earth systems. We do not argue against such acquisitions. We do, however, argue that a change in perspective\nconcerning space-based measurements is needed. Simply put, our\nchanged perspective would place sustainability and environmental\nconcerns on an equal footing with the more traditional view where\nmeasurement quality is assessed through metrology properties\nalone and where measurement processes are designed to take into\naccount mostly economical and technological constraints. This\nholistic approach would integrate interactions between remote\nsensing observation systems and the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s environment. This\n\nPlease cite this article in press as: Durrieu S, Nelson RF, Earth observation from space e The issue of environmental sustainability, Space Policy\n(2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.07.003\n\n12\n\nS. Durrieu, R.F. Nelson / Space Policy xxx (2013) 1e13\n\nnew perspective would require that the measurements needed to\nmonitor Earth resources be acquired at regional and global scales in\naccordance with sustainability principles and with our commitment to reducing environmental impacts. For instance, LCA analyses may indicate that the objectives of some projects may be\nbetter met by an extensive, long-term airborne campaign rather\nthan with a new satellite launch. We recognize that these analyses\nare complicated and may introduce ambiguous imponderables\n(e.g. national pride, technological primacy, data control) that are\nnear-impossible to quantify in terms of, for instance, a CO2 budget.\nHowever, many projects or missions are not necessarily cuttingedge and may, in fact, be redundant with, or worse, less capable\nthan, satellites currently acquiring data globally. Software and databases exist that can facilitate the decision-making process, but\nthey must be adapted to model space activity impacts to be effective. The European Space Agency (ESA) is currently developing an\nLCA tool that will facilitate implementation of LCA studies for some\nof its missions. And ESA intends to generalize the use of such approaches in the European space activity sector.\nSuch goals strengthen the capacity of measurement processes\nto meet their stated functional goal, i.e. sustainable management\nof Earth resources. Currently, space remote sensing is mainly\ndriven by economic and technical considerations; sustainability is\nsimply assumed. There are notable uncertainties concerning the\nfuture of LEO accessibility and on the effects of pollution concomitant with space activity. We suggest some measures that\ncould help to design future observation systems in a more sustainable way. To this end, studies that carefully assess the environmental impacts of the several measurement approaches\ncurrently available should be considered. As a study case, we\nfocus in the last part of this paper on vegetation lidar missions,\nthe principal scienti\xef\xac\x81c objectives of which would be the measurement and monitoring of forest structure. Several spaceborne\nvegetation lidar projects have been proposed by scientists to\nspace agencies, but to no avail thus far. Such remote sensing solutions would be very useful in the development of much needed\nmonitoring systems for measuring, assessing, and reporting key\nforest parameters such as biomass and carbon. However, we are\nconvinced that durability of forest observations that rely on\nspaceborne lidar systems would be increased by taking into account the issues discussed in this paper and by exploring some of\nthe avenues suggested here to improve the sustainability of these\nremote sensing systems. To reach such a goal the \xef\xac\x81rst step is to\nincrease awareness of the issues addressed in this paper, issues\nwhich are rarely mentioned and discussed. Acquiring data in\naccordance with sustainability principles increases their quality in\nthe value-pluralism context of sustainable development. The ESA\nhas reached the same conclusions, even if some of the arguments\nthat they put forward concern the wellbeing of space industry.\nThe Clean Space Of\xef\xac\x81ce, which is part of the ESA policy department, is a pioneer in this area and has initiated studies to directly\naddress such issues. We look forward to their initial reports and\nexpect that their results will provide concrete examples and\ncriteria to foster debate on many of the issues discussed in this\npaper.\nReferences\n[1] Simonett D.
