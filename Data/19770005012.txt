Above a Hale sector\nboundary the green corona has maximum brightness, while above a non-Hale\n\n=\t\n\nboundary the green corona has a minimum brightness.

Wilcox\n\ni\'\ni\n\nInstitute for Plasma Research\nStanford University\nStanford, California\n\nThere is growing acceptance of the importance of large-scale\nstructures on the sun. Such large-scale organizations of solar\nfeatures are being recognized both on spatial and on temporal scales.\n\ni\n\nSolar activity is also being studied with increasingly higher\nresolution in time and space; the interplay between these small-scale\nfeatures and the large-scale structures is poorly understood both observationally and theoretically.\nThe Large-scale solar structures can be divided into zonal structures and sectorial structures. Zonal structures include the polar caps\n(e.g. Howard, 1972), the sunspot zones, and the prominence zones (e.g.\nWaldmeier, 1973). Sectorial structures include magnetic sectors (e.g.\n(Timothy et al.,\nWilcox, 1968) and at least some coronal holes \t\n1975), With each class of structures there are associated phenomena\nthat share basic characteristics of their class, In particular we should\n\nmention the varied influences of these large-scale structures on the corona\nand its entension into the solar wind. The importance of magnetic fields\nfor all classes of structures is paramount,\n\' Due to their antisymmetric character the zonal structures exhibit\n\n&\t\n\nry\n\nr\n\na strong solar cycle dependence. Magnetic features change polarity with\nthe cycle and the zones move in latitude. The sectorial structures. seem\nit\n\nto be much_ less controlled by the solar cycle (Svalgaard and Wilcox, 1975;\nl\n\n17\n4\t\n\n142\n\nM\n\n6.\n\ne\n5\ni\nA\n\nSvalgaard et al., 1975), although some coupling has been observed.\nMagnetic sectors drift slowly westward during the first half of the\nsunspot cycle and slowly eastward during the second half (Svalgaard\nand Wilcox, 1975), It is characteristic for sectorial structures to\nshow little or no differential rotation, whereas zonal structures are\nclosely linked to - and possibly maintained by - the differential solar\nrotation. These rather different properties of the zonal and the sectorial\nstructures \' are difficult to explain and have lead to the suggestion\n\n(\n\nWilcox,\n\n1971) that the two classes of structures have different origin and co-exist\nmore or less independently,\nObservations of the sun show the zonal structures most readily,\nwhile observations of the interplanetary medium\n\n(\n\nat least near the solar\n\nequatorial plane) show clear sectorial structures which then can be used\nin statistical analyses to recover sector structure in the photosphere. In\ni\n\nthe inner corona, where both structures can be directly observed through the influence of associated enhancements, streamers and current sheets, an\nextremely complicated configuration can result. Only occasionally is\nthe inner coronal structure simple enough to clearly reveal its nature\nand origin. With increasing distance from the sun the configuration becomes increasingly simpler and already at about 6R0 the coronal structure\nis dominated by large-scale sectorial forms\n\n(\n\nHoward and Koomen, 1974) in\n\nthe low-latitude region. At higher latitudes the polar cap fields dominate\n1.\n\nG\t\n5\t\n\n:.\n\nF\t\n\nduring most of the sunspot cycle and it is very likely that this dominance\n\n^.\n\nextends into the solar wind\n\n(\n\ne.g._Svalgaard , et al., 1975) so that the\n\ns.\n\nsector structure of the interplanetary magnetic field most of the time is\nconfined to a rather thin region near the solar equatorial plane. The implir\n\ncation is that in most of the heliosphere the polar fields determine the\n\n4p\n\npolarity of the interplanetary magnetic field. Such afield geometry could\nlF^\n\nhave important consequences forthe propagation of cosmic rays within the\n\n1\t\n\nr\nt\'.\ni\n\nsolar system (Svalgaard and Wilcox, 1976). Discussions of the coronal\nstructure that may result from coexistence of the polar fields and of the\nlow-latitude sector fields can be found in Svalgaard et al. (\nHansen et al.\n\n(\n\n1\n\n974a) and in\n\n1974).\n\n2\n\na_\n\n....\n\n,\n\n,,\n\na\n\n.,..\n\n....\n\n,\nSince the discovery by Wolfer 1 1897) that solar activity often\nhas a nonuniform distribution with heliographic longitude, the concept\nof "active latitudes" has been discussed by several workers. Using the\nsynoptic charts of weak fields from the \'Atlas of Solar Magnetic Fields\'\nobserved at the Aft_ Wilson Observatory, Bumba and Howard (1969) convincingly\nshowed the reality of active longitudes as recurrences in the large-sca,e\nphotospheric magnetic field distribution. Bumba and Howard (1969) found\na strong regularity of magnetic polarity alternations in longitude and a\npersistence of these features in time. Single-polarity features (called\nsections by \'Bumba and Howard), usually resulting from the fusion of the\nsame polarity fields of several active regions) generally extend across\nthe equator. Such sections can often be followed for at least ten rotations,\nand form rows when the synoptic charts are arranged below each other in time.\nSeveral rows may be associated to forr streams that may be followed for\nseveral years. These streams as well as the individual rows have a synodic\nrotation period of 27.0 days and show no differential rotation of the overall pattern, while single short-lived features within the rows do partake\nin the differential rotation. In addition, intensifications of the streams\noccur that drift in longitude from one stream to the next, etc., corresponding to a synodic rotation period near 28 3/4 days.\nIt seems clear that the existence of "active longitudes" implies\nthat the distinction between zonal and sectorial. structures is not absolute\non an observational basis. Zonal structures can have longitudinal or sectorial organization. A major problem is the identification of the "sections"\nk`\tx-\n\nwith the sector structure. The sections are generally too small (typically\n0\n0\n30 wide) compared to sectors (typically 90 wide or more) and therefore\neach sector will often encompass several sections of alternating polarity.\n\nr\n{\t\n\nClear observations of individual sector boundaries in the photosphere have\n\ni\ni\t \'-\n\ndi\n\nnot yet been made, thus forcing us to a statistical approach that has not\nso far been able to reveal the detailed solar source of the sectorial structures.\n\na\n\nStudies by Antonucci and Duvall (1974) and Svalgaard et.al .(1974b) suggest a\ncoupling between the sector structure and solar activity. We shall discuss this\n\nr\n\ncoupling or link in greater detail later in the present paper; for the\nr\n\nmoment we might comment on a possible implication of a coupling between\n\nF\n\n3\n\ne\n\n4y\t\n\nsolar activity and solar sector structure. At first sight\n\nsucn a\n\ncoupling\n\nis obvious: The dispersing remnants of active regions form extended mainly unipolar - magnetic regions on the sun. These large-scale structures\nmap out into the corona and the solar wind resulting in a similar ordering\nof the interplanetary magnetic field. Schatten et al. (1968) discuss observations of a solar active region that appeared to produce magnetic loops in\nthe interplanetary medium resulting in the formation of a new sector in the\ninterplanetary magnetic field and suggest that "the evolution of sectors\nfrom magnetic bipolar regions" may be similar in general to the specific\ncase they studied. That the dispersion of active regions into weak background fields and the subsequent evolution of these extended fields provide\na reasonable explanation for the apparent sectorial structures is a point\nof view commonly found among solar researchers (e.g. Timothy et al., 1975).\nThe alternative viewpoint\n\nis\n\nalso viable. Here it\n\nthe sector structure of the magnetic field\n\nis\n\nis\n\nassumed that\n\na fundamental property of\n\nthe sun and probably other magnetic stars as well. Physical mechanisms\nthat result in sectorial structures have been discussed by several workers\nincluding Stix (1974), Suess (1975) and Wolff (1974). The fundamental\nlarge-scale magnetic structures couple to general solar activity resulting\nin active longitudes and long-lived recurrent features.\nAs a specific example of an interaction between the zonal and\nsectorial properties of solar magnetism, we discuss the concept of the\nHale sector boundary. As shown schematically in Figure 1, the Hale\nboundary is the half of a sector boundary in which the change of sector\nfield polarity is the same as the change ofpolarity from a preceeding\nspot to a following spot. Consider the righthand boundary in Figure 1,\nwhich represents a change of sector field polarity from - to +. In the\nr\n\nnorthern hemisphere this change of magnetic polarity is the same as the\nchange from preceeding to following spot polarity, so the northern half.\nof this boundary is the Hale boundary_\n\n}\n\nWe shall first show that above a Hale sector boundary the green\ncorona has maximum brightness, while above a non-Hale boundar y the Breen\n4\n\na\n\n\t\n\nt\n\ns\n.z\ncorona has minimum brightness. Figure 2 shows the observed relative\nbrightness of the northern green corona during sunspot cycles number 18,\n19 and 20 as a function of distance from the sector boundary. The\nordinate is the quantity 2(N-SV(N+S), where N represents the brightness\nof the green corona on the Pic du Midi scale for each day, and S is the\nsame for the southern hemisphere. Computing the relative brightness of\nthe northern hemisphere in this way removes the effect of brightness\nvariations through the sunspot cycle,and of variations in instrumental\ncalibration.\t\n\nThe top curves are for a sector boundary with polarity\n\nchange from + to - and show that the n=thern half of such a boundary is\nat a minimum in coronal brightness in cycle 18, a maximum in brightness\nin cycle 19, and a minimum in brightness in cycle 20. As shown in Figure 1,\nthe northern half of this boundary was not a Hale boundary in cycles 18 and 20\nand therefore has a minimum in coronal brightness. The bottom curves of Figure 2\nshow that for a sector boundary with polarity change from - to + the relative\nbrightness in the northern hemisphere is just the opposite. In particular,\nas we see from Figure 1, the northern half of this boundary is a Hale boundary\nin cycles 18 and 20 and has a clear maximum in coronal brightness in these cycles\nWe note in Figure 2 that the time interval between maxima (and between minima) is usually approximately 131 days, showing that four sectors\nper rotation is the predominant pattern (Svalgaard and Wilcox, 1975),\n\nThe maximum in green corona brightness over a Hale boundary and a\nminimum over a non-Hale boundary are observed at low, middle and high\nlatitudes. The filled dots in Figure 3 show the relative coronal brightness above Hale boundaries during cycles 18, 19 and 20. The open circles\nshow the relative coronal brightness above non-Hale boundaries during these\ncycles. We see that the effect is to be found in all three ranges of latitude._\nFigure 4 shows how rapidly the Hale portion of * a sector boundary\t\nchanges from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere (or vice\n\ni\n[\nt\n\nversa) near the time of sunspot minimum. The ordinate of the top frame\nin. Figure 4 shows the relative coronal brightness in the northern hemisphere\nabove a boundary with polarity change + to -. During sunspot cycle 19 the\nt\n5\nY\'S\nY\n\n,3i\n\n.\n\nnorthern half of the boundary was a Hale boundary, We see that within\noue year near 1954 the northern half of this boundary changed from having\nminimum coronal brightness to maximum coronal brightness. The opposite\nchange occured within one year near 1964 when, with the change of spot\npolarities from one cycle to the next, the northern half of this boundary\nchanged from being a Hale boundary to a non-Hale boundary.\nThe bottom frame of Figure 4 shows the total brightness of the green\ncorona as a function of time from 1947 to 1970. Note that there is almost\nno variation in the maximum coronal brightness from one cycle to the next,\ndespite the fact that the maximum sunspot number decreased by almost a\nfactor of 2 between the maximum of cycle 19 and the maximum of cycle 20.\nThis suggests that the large-scale coronal brightness may be more closely\nrelated to the sectorial aspects of solar magnetism (which appear to be\nrelatively unchanging from one cycle to the next) then to the zonal\n(activity) aspects of solar magnetism.\nThe Hale portion of a photospheric sector boundary tends to have\nmaximum magnetic field strength while the non-Hale portion has minimum\nfield strength. Figure 5 shows an average synoptic map of the magnitude\nof the photospheric magnetic field observed at Mt, Wilson Observatory\nduring 1967 to 1973 around 104 sector boundaries in which the polarity\nchanged from - to +. At this time the northern hemisphere portion of\nthis boundary was the Hale boundary and we see in Figure 5 a maximum\nin the magnitude of the photospheric field near the boundary in the\nnorthern hemisphere and a minimum near the boundary in the southern (non\nHale) hemisphere. Figure 6 shows the same analysis except for 107 sector\nboundaries with polarity change from + to -. The Hale portion of this\nboundary at this time was in the southern hemisphere. We see a maximum\nin photospheric field magnitude near the boundary in the southern hemisphere,\nand a minimum near the boundary in the northern hemisphere. Thus we see\nthat both the coronal brightness and the magnitude of the photospheric magnetic field are a maximum near the Hale portion of sector boundaries, and\na minimum near the non-Hale portion of boundaries.\n\n6\n\nSince the two fundamental quantities coronal brightness and magnitude\nof the photospheric field are a maximum near the Hale portion of sector\nboundaries and a minimum near the non-Hale portion of boundaries, we\nmay expect that other aspects of solar structure and solar activity may\nbe related to Hale boundaries and to non-Hale boundaries. \t\n\nFurther study\n\nof this interaction between the sectorial aspect of solar magnetic structure\nand the zonal (activity) aspect of solar magnetic structure may improve our\nunderstanding of solar magnetism.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank-Robert Howard for the Mt.
