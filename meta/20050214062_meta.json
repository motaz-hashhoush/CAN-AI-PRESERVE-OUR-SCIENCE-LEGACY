The ICTD Project will provide the opportunity to conduct technology demonstration tests of advanced turbine engine components (e.g., combustor, compressor, turbine, and materials) as part of an integrated system (TRL 6). Initially, the major objectives of the Integrated Components Technology Demonstrations project are to Conduct component technology evaluation and system studies to determine, and prioritize, the most promising propulsion concepts, cycle, and architecture for a propulsion system with a Technology Availability Date of approximately 2010 and Entry Into Service of 2015. Determine the most attractive, cost-effective approaches for conducting the needed demonstration tests. Conduct demonstration tests of selected component technologies (i.e.,2200 F CMC combustor liner and aspirating seal) in partnership with industry.", "title": "Integrated Components Technology Demonstrations Overview", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T12:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050214062, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Long-Davis, Mary Jo"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Glenn Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "5836fa19391e442e8e35c0a44afb8423"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050214062, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050214062, "id": "6333b7dd48c542b2b3f4b425e0873535", "publicationName": "NASA Glenn Research Center UEET (Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology) Program: Agenda and Abstracts", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20050214031, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Glenn Research Center UEET (Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology) Program: Agenda and Abstracts", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
