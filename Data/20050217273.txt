b'2.2 Experimental Microfluidic System\nFLIGHT DATES:\nJune 28 - July 2, 2004\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS:\nChristopher Culbertson, Kansas State University\nSteve Gonda, NASA/Johnson Space Center\nJohn Michael Ramsey, University of North Carolina\n\nGOAL:\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to integrate microfluidic devices with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s space\nbioreactor systems. In such a system, the microfluidic device would provide realtime feedback\ncontrol of the bioreactor by monitoring pH, glucose, and lactate levels in the cell media; and\nwould provide an analytical capability to the bioreactor in exterrestrial environments for\nmonitoring bioengineered cell products and health changes in cells due to environmental\nstressors. Such integrated systems could be used as biosentinels both in space and on planet\nsurfaces.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo demonstrate the ability of microfabricated devices to repeatedly and reproducibly perform\nbead cytometry experiments in \xc2\xb5, lunar, martian, and hypergravity (1.8g).\n\n9\n\nBACKGROUND:\nMicrofluidic or Lab-on-a-Chip devices are small platforms upon which a complete chemical\nanalysis can be performed. These devices consist of a series of small interconnecting channels\n(10\xc2\xb5m deep and 40 to 200mm wide) etched in glass, or molded in polymers, through which\nfluids can be moved. The fluids can either be controlled with electric potentials generating\nelectric fields within the channels that move fluid electrokinetically, or by generating pressure\ndifferentials using a syringe pump or peristaltic pump that moves the fluid hydrodynamically.\nUsing these two methods of controlling fluid flow it is possible to generate devices that have\nmultiple uses. For example it is possible to use hydrodynamic flow to rapidly move large\nnumbers of cells or large particles, such as beads, through a focusing intersection much faster\nthan if one were to use electrokinetic flow. On the other hand electric fields allow for the\nseparation of differentially charged analytes using capillary electrophoresis, something\nhydrodynamic flow alone can not accomplish. These devices provide many advantages over\nconventional bench top scale instrumentation as a result of their ability to integrate sample\nhandling and sample processing operations with analyte detection on a single, monolithic\nsubstrate. Such integration allows for the efficient automation of chemical analyses. In addition\nto automation and integration, microchips have several other inherent advantages over\nconventional chemical analysis instrumentation. These advantages include (1) the ability to\nperform faster separations with no loss in separation efficiency, (2) lower reagent and sample\nconsumption (< 1mL/year), (3) less waste production, and (4) the ability to fabricate many\nparallel systems on the same device. Thus far, their performance has been either equivalent to or\nbetter than conventional laboratory devices in all cases investigated. They appear to offer the rare\ncombination of better-faster-cheaper simultaneously, and their ability to manipulate reagents and\nreaction products \xe2\x80\x9con-chip\xe2\x80\x9d suggests the potential to perform virtually any type of \xe2\x80\x9cwetchemical\xe2\x80\x9d bench procedure on a microfabricated device.\nThe advantages described above make these devices especially interesting for use in\nextraterrestrial environments where small, portable, rugged, and reliable devices capable of\nsustained remote automated operation will be required.\n\n10\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS:\nMicrofluidic Experiment Description\nThe portable microfluidic device developed for these tests contained in a Bud box enclosure\n(NBA10148) which had exterior dimension of approximately 30 cm wide x 18 cm deep x 40 cm\nhigh. The microchips, in their custom machined 2-part PMMA holder, were attached to an x-y\npositioning plate (ST1XY-S; Thor Labs Inc.; Newton, NJ) and positioned above a microscope\nobjective (CD-240-M40X; creative devices, Neshanic Station, NJ). This objective was used to\nfocus the excitation light of a green laser pointer (The Laser Guy, Seabrook, TX). The laser was\nmodified to have a remote switch and power supply (2 D cell batteries). The laser module\nconsisted of an 808 nm laser diode which was shifted to 1064 nm and then frequency doubled to\nprovide a continuous output of 5 mW at 532 nm. The laser beam was reflected off a dichroic\nmirror (560 DRLP: Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) prior to being focused into the microchip\nchannel by the microscope objective. The fluorescence from the labeled amino acids was\ncollected by the same microscope objective, passed through the dichroic mirror, a 1.0 mm\npinhole, and a 565 nm longpass filter (565ALP, Omega Optical) prior to being detected at a\nchannel photomultiplier tube (MD972; Perkin Elmer; Fremont, CA). The PMT was powered by a\n5 volt power supply. The gain was manually controlled by a potentiometer which had a locking\nmechanism to prevent accidental change.\nThe high voltages used for making injections and performing the electrophoretic separations on\nthe microchip were provided by two independent high voltage power supplies cabable of 125 ma\noutputs at up to 8 kv (C80; Emco High Voltage Corp.). Each high voltage power supply was\npowered by a 15 VDC source. The HV output was determined by a 0-5 VDC control signal\nprovided by a National Instruments AO card (DAQCard AO-2DC). These power supplies each\noccupied only 19 cm3 and weighed 51 g, making them very suitable for portable applications.\nA syringe with a locking stop was used to provide pressure to drive the hydrodynamic flow for\nthe bead and cell focusing experiments.\nThe entire instrument was controlled and data were acquired using in-house written LabVIEW\nsoftware run off a laptop computer.\nProtocol\nOrange fluorescent polystyrene microspheres that have a 10\xc2\xb5m diameter were diluted into the\nrunning buffer to make a bead concentration of 6.5x106 beads/ ml (Molecular Probes, Eugene,\nOR). The run buffer was composed of 25 mm NaBorate and 0.01% (v/v) Silwet. The Silwet\nhelped prevent aggregation of the particles and particles adsorption to the capillary sidewalls.\nSonication of this solution was performed prior to focusing experiments to further reduce bead\naggregation.\nTo perform the bead focusing experiments a 25 mm NaBorate and 0.01% Silwet solution were\nplaced in channels B and C (Figure 1), while the bead solution was placed in channel A. A low\npressure was applied to channel D using a syringe pump. This caused fluids from A, B, and C to\nconverge at the cross intersection. The beads were consequently focused and detected using the\nLIF system described above.\n\n11\n\nA\nA\nC\n\nB\nB\n\nC\n\nD\nD\nFigure 1: Schematic of bead cytometry experiment, and CCD imaging of 10 micron spheres being\nfocused at the cross intersection.\n\nRESULTS:\nBead cytometry was performed on two of the three flights, June 30th and July 1st. Figure 2 below\nshows an example of the bead cytometry experiment at 0.026 g. There was no significant\ndifference between the cytometry experiment at 0.026 g, and 1.768 g. The particle velocity was\n2.3 meters per second and the volumetric flow rate was 0.036ml/s. To properly sample the\nrapidly flowing beads, the data acquisition rate used was 20 kHz. The maximum particle count\nrate at this data acquisition rate is about 3,000/s. Our experiment had a count rate of 200/s with\nan average intensity of 0.95\xc2\xb10.4. The velocity of the beads, maximum count rate, average and\nstandard deviation of the intensity and flow rate can be seen in Table 1.\n\n12\n\nFluorescence (Arb.

The separation was working on the ground prior to the flight, but unfortunately an\nelectrical failure with the laser catastrophically caused the experiment to fail. This problem was\nsolved by integrating a new 30 mW laser that has a longer lifetime for future flights.\nDISCUSSION:\nThis data shows that it is possible to perform bead cytometry in reduced gravity environments.\nThe throughput of the device is absolutely outstanding with respect to the number of beads it can\ncount per second, although the standard deviation of the mean amplitude of the fluorescent signal\nis relatively high. This suggests that the focusing at the intersection needs to be tighter to assure\nthat the particles pass through the interrogation beam single file.\nTable 1: Summary of Results for Bead Cytometry Experiments\nBead Velocity\n2.3 m/s\nMax.
