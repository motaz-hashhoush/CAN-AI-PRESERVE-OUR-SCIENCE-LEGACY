The impacts are at velocities of 35 to 830 m/sec with a single-stage powder gun. The morphology of craters formed in loose sands is generally conical, whereas that of craters formed in self-compacted sands varies with increasing impact velocity from a flat-floor type to a double-ring type. The present data, together with previous experimental data and the 'late-stage equivalence' of Dienes and Walsh, are seen as indicating that the crater diameter is expressed by a function of the 'late-stage effective energy' but not of the impact kinetic energy. The diameter of a crater formed in a noncohesive sand is found to be proportional to one-fourth the power of the late-state effective energy. For general impact cratering in a target with a finite strength, a relation is given between the velocity and the diameter, suggesting that there are four regimes in the crater diameter versus kinetic energy relation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19830040100, "endDate": "1982-03-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Lunar and Planetary Science Conference", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "d3954561085342f0a1f0f6afba1f81bf", "startDate": "1982-03-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830040100, "id": "9b9215b19a1b43c58589bd4f5abe8397", "publicationDate": "1983-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
