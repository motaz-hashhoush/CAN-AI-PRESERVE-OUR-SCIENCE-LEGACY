the payload bay of the Space Shuttle Orbiter, the\nouter module would be telescopically deployed to achieve nearly twice as\nmuch usable space station volume per Shuttle launch as would be achieved\nthrough the use of more conventional module concepts.\n\nBy retracting the\n\nouter module over the inner module, significantly enhanced protection\nagainst space debris and radiation could be achieved.\n\nThe telescoping\n\nnature of the modules lends the concept to variations in space station configuration, assembly, and disassembly.\n\nAdaptations of the telescoping con-\n\ncept could also provide flexibility in the methods in which the Shuttle\nOrbiter is docked or berthed with the space station and decrease the chances\nof damage because of accidental contact between the station and the orbiter\nduring such maneuvers.\n\nThe concept requires no new technologies.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCurrent NASA plans regarding the\n\nconstr~ction\n\nof a permanently manned\n\norbiting spdce station include the use of the Space Shuttle to deliver\nmodules to orbit.\n\nThese modules will provide living and working quarters\n\nfor the space station crews and will house experimental and manufacturing\nequipment.\n\nIn order to minimize the transportation costs, prudence must be\n\nexercised to assure the delivery of maximum space station capability per\nlaunch or per series of launches.\n\nPreliminary studies have indicated that\n\nif instrumented space station modules were packaged within the orbiter payload bay, payload volume constraints would be reached before payload mass\nconstraints.\n\nA space station module design concept described herein seeks\n\n1\n\nto take better advantage of the payload capabilities of the Shuttle Orbiter,\nwhile enhancing the capability of the space station.\nThe concept involves what might be described as telescoping modules\n(two modules in each assemblage).\n\nTwo assemblages could easily fit within\n\nthe Space Shuttle Oribter payload bay with additional volume and payload to\nspare.\n\nUpon deployment at the space station, each assemblage would provide\n\nessentially twice the usable volume of the more conventional module concepts.\n\nThis concept appears to offer the following advantages over more\n\nconventional module concepts:\n(1) Additional usable space station volume at a reduced delivery to\norbit cost per volume.\n(2) Enhanced protection against debris and radiation hazards.\n(3) Amenability to variations in space station configuration.\n(4) Enhanced flexibility regarding berthing and docking with the\nShuttle Orbiter.\nTHE BASIC CONCEPT\nThe basic concept involves essentially a cylindrical can within a can\n(fig. 1).\n\nThe outer can, which has one open end, encloses the inner can.\n\nThe inner can has one tapered end with a hatch and one untapered end with a\nhatch.\n\nThe outer can has one tapered end with a hatch.\n\nThe overall length\n\nof the outer can is 25 feet, and its outer diameter is 14 feet.\n\nTwo such\n\nassemblages could easily fit end to end in the Shuttle Orbiter payload bay,\nwith room to spare.\n\nAssuming that the STS payload capability to the orbit\n\nfor the space station is 65,000 pounds and that each twin can assemblage\n(uninstrumented) weighs 16,000 pounds, 33,000 pounds of payload are\navailable (for instrumenting the cans).\ninstrumented prior to launch.\n2\n\nOnly the inner can could be\n\nPRESSURIZATION\nThere are two options regarding module pressure at launch.\n\nOne is to\n\nvent the entire assemblage from ground to orbit and then pressurize on\norbit.\n\nThe other is to pressurize the inner can to 30 psia air prior to\n\nlaunch, and through expansion of the assemblage at the station and equalization of the compartment pressure, provide the standard 14.7 psia initial\natmosphere.\nDEPLOYMENT\nUpon arrival at the station and removal of the assemblages from the\nOrbiter payload bay, the unpressurized and vented outer can is deployed from\nthe inner can (fig. 2).\n\nAlthough this deployment could probably be accom-\n\nplished by unventing the outer can and pressurizing it with air from the\ninner can, air losses would be quite high unless the inflatable seals\n(fig. 2 and detailed in fig. 3) were inflated.\nthe seals inflated could damage the seals.\n(fig. 4) might be advisable.\n\nDeploying the outer can with\n\nTherefore, mechanical deployers\n\nRelease of some air into the outer can may be\n\nnecessary during deployment in order to prevent binding between the surfaces\nof the two cans.\n\nHowever, proper control and monitoring of the amperage on\n\nthe electric drive motors should preclude such binding problems.\n\nUpon\n\ndeployment of the outer can to obtain a total assemblage length of perhaps\n48 feet, the three inflatable seals (fig. 3) are inflated, or an alternative\nseal system\n\nis\n\nengaged.\n\nAll vents to the outer can are then closed, and the\n\npressure between the inner and outer can be equalized to atmospheric\npressure.\nEach of the two deployed assemblages consists of an empty can and one\nwhich is probably already instrumented.\n\nEither end can be attached to an\n\nexisting set of space station modules or utilized to formulate the initial\n\n3\n\nspace station.\n\nThe empty end may remain unattached in order to simplify\n\ntransfer of equipment from the Orbiter.\n\nThe useful space station volume\n\ndelivered to orbit by a Shuttle mission can be essentially doubled by\nutilizing this concept.\n\nUse of this volume is discussed later.\nSAFE HAVEN\n\nIf a situation evolves where the station is in danger of being struck\nby space debris, and evasive maneuvers by the space station are impractical,\na potential option offered by this concept is to make one of the assemblages\na safe haven.\n\nWith volume a prime concern onboard the station, the unin-\n\nstrumented end of the safe haven assemblage could provide an excellent location for storage, cleaning, and repair of extravehicular activity (EVA)\nsuits.\n\nProvided sufficient warning was available, the EVA suits and associ-\n\nated equipment could be removed from the uninstrumented can, the hatch\nbetween the two cans closed, the outer can vented, seals depressurized, and\nthe outer can translated over the inner can.\n\nBoth of the cans could consist\n\nof a double wall structure, the inner wall being the pressure vessel and the\n\nouter wall being a meteoroid/debris "bumper."\n\nWith the outer can covering\n\nthe inner can, all but one end of the inner can is afforded four layers of\nprotection against space debris.\n\nShould such a technique be utilized, four\n\nlayers of protection could be built into the end of the inner can which is\nnot protected by the outer can.\n\nBecause of the nature in which meteoroid\n\n"bumpers" function, actual double protection might not be achieved, but substantial enhancement of protection would be assured.\nSimilar actions could be taken in the event of a potential exposure to\nabnormally high radiation levels.\ncause such a situation.\n\n4\n\nA high-altitude nuclear explosion could\n\nThere also exists the possibility of a solar flare\'\n\nproducing abnormally high radiation levels at the altitude and inclination\nof the space station.\n\n(Plasma from the solar flare may alter the structure\n\nof the Earth\'s magnetosphere and thus the distribution and levels of radiation.)\n\nAlthough doubling the mass of a radiation shield does not double its\n\nshielding capabilities, substantial shielding enhancement is achieved.\n\nIn\n\naddition, proper selection of pressure vessel and "bumper" materials may\ngreatly enhance the ability of the multiwall protection system described\nherein to reduce the formation of Bremsstrahlung or "secondary radiation"\n(formed by space radiation penetrating the station structural material) and\nenhance the ability of the system to attenuate that which is formed.\nProvided there is sufficient free volume in the safe haven\n(instrumented inner can), enhanced safe haven capabilities could be obtained\nby placing the EVA suits in the inner can safe haven prior to enclosing the\nsafe haven in the outer can.\n\nBy doing so, the suits would be available for\n\nEVA inspection of the exterior of the station following a hazardous situation.\n\nThis could be particularly important in that it would preclude enter-\n\ning a potentially dangerous volume of the station in order to don the\nsuits.\n\nAlso, if on the outside chance that a tumbling uncontrolled station\n\nresulted from some mishap, direct EVA egress would permit rescue by the\nShuttle Orbiter without attempting a hazardous berthing or docking of the\nOrbiter with the tumbling station.\nSTATION CONFIGURATION VARIATIONS\nClosed loop or "race track" space station configurations (fig. 5) have\nan advantage over other configurations in that dual egress is provided from\nany hazardous area within the station.\n\nOnly one safe haven is required for\n\nsuch configurations because it can be reached by anyone onboard.\n\nHaving a\n\n5\n\nsingle safe haven has the advantage of holding down the cost of consumables,\nmonitoring systems, and controls required for multiple safe havens.\n\n"Race\n\ntrack" concepts have been difficult to configure, particularly for an initial station.\n\nThe modules currently being considered for space station are\n\ntoo short and not sufficient in number to lend themselves to such a configuration.\n\nThe present concept would essentially double the length of the\n\nmodules, making a "race track" configuration more viable.\nA potential problem with "race track" configurations is that they can\npresent difficulties when replacing a module, particularly if the station\nconfiguration is rectangular in nature.\n\nCare must be taken not to induce\n\nundue moments in the connecting joints of the remaining modules.\n\nThis can\n\nmean dealing with very close clearance between very large structures.\ntelescoping concept would nullify such problems.\n\nThe\n\nModules could be partially\n\nor fully collapsed to permit module change out without fear of overloading\njoints.\n\nDOCKING AND BERTHING\nThe telescoping module concept or modifications thereof might provide\nflexibility in docking/berthing of the Orbiter with the station.\n\nA concern\n\nhas been the avoidance of accidental contact with and damage to portions of\nthe station or Orbiter during such maneuvers.\n\nThe use of a telescoping\n\nmodule, perhaps one comprising more than two cans (fig. 6), could greatly\ndecrease the chance of the Orbiter contacting other parts of the station\nduring docking or berthing by moving out to meet the Orbiter.\n\nUSE OF ADDITIONAL VOLUME\nStudies (unpublished) of the human factors aspect of living and working\non a space station have indicated the importance of free volume to occupants\n\n6\n\nof the station.\n\nThe additional volume made available through the use of\n\ntelescoping modules could likely be put to good use in providing privacy\nareas, exercise areas, and a place for all the crew to meet.\nvolume tends to fill up as a space program progresses.\n\nUnallotted\n\nAs activity on the\n\nstation grows, new pieces of scientific equipment will be arriving.\n\nThis\n\nequipment could be either temporarily or permanently placed within the\nvolumes available in the outer cans.\nSEALS\nInitial studies of seal concepts (fig. 3) indicate several\npossibilities.\n\nInflatable seals of the type used for many years in the\n\nlarge butterfly valves in vacuum systems at NASA langley Research Center are\none option.\n\nThe outer surface of the inner can would be grooved to prevent\n\nthe seals from translating.\n\nIncluded in the figure is a process by which\n\nthe outer seal could be replaced. \' The outer seal is the only one which\nwould require replacement by EVA.\n\nAdditional safety features not discussed\n\nherein could easily be incorporated into this seal system.\n\nTwo concepts\n\ninvolving compression seals or a combination of compression and inflatable\nseals are also shown.\nMECHANICAL DEPLOYERS\nTwo potential translation mechanisms are shown (fig. 4).\n\nThey consist\n\nmerely of electric motors and either worm gears or gear tracks embedded in\nthe inner wall of the outer vessel.\n\nThese would be located every 90 0 around\n\nthe assemblage.\nCONCLUSIONS\nA design concept has been described wherein telescoping space station\nmodules would be utilized to take better advantage of the payload capabilities of the Shuttle Orbiter, while enhancing the capability of the space\n\n7\n\nstation.\n\nThe concept requires no new technologies, and appears to offer the\n\nfollowing advantages over more conventional space station module concepts:\n(1)\n\nNearly twice the usable space station volume at no additional\nlaunch
