Students will view an informative video on\nmy educational experience at KSC. We will then do a hands-on activity that will reinforce what\nmy team was in charge of After an overview of my experience, students will be assigned to a\ncooperative group that will be in charge of a specific engineer job. They will individually\nresearch that engineering job and summarize what they learned to their group. There will be an\noral presentation from each group that will allow all groups to hear about different areas of\nengineering. The groups will then work on practical math applications that deal with their\nparticular job. These will relate to specific standards and problem-solving areas listed on the\nFCAT. After the groups are done with their activities, they will move on to the next group and\nrepeat the process till they had a chance to experience a little bit what each specific engineer\ndoes. A guest speaker from USA will come into the class and explain what they do and answer\nquestions that will further enrich the students\' understanding. Finally, the students will\nparticipate in the MATHCOUNTS competition.\n\nSignature- SIFT Employee:\n\nSignature- Supervisor:\t\n\n\t Date:\n\nDate:\n\nPage 1\n\nKratz 2007\n\nTable of Contents\t\n\nPage\n\nOverview .

Test Operations includes the\nmanagers, engineers, and technicians that run the tests on the aft skirt and forward assembly of\nthe solid rocket booster including the electrical components of the lEA and the TVC system.\nBecause I am new to area, I knew little about the space program. I felt as though many of\nthe students knew more about the space program than I did. I wanted to be able to have, an\nunderstanding of what goes on at NASA and also get my students interested in the program.\nThanks to the people at USA, I was able to have tours of the different facilities and see many\noperations and tests being run. I gained a valuable experience that I will be able to take back into\nmy classroom and share with the students and help motivate them to learn.\nFirst, I want to give my students an idea of what the solid rocket boosters are and how\nthey work. We will be doing a group experiment to show how the rocket launches and use math\nto show what had to be done in order for the rocket to even be able to launch. Many students\nprobably don\'t know about the long process that goes into preparing for a successful launch.\nWhile at NASA, I became familiar with many different people with many different jobs.\nBecause my students have to do a senior project on careers, I would like to involve my students\nin different careers at the space center. Not only will they research a career of their choice, they\nwill also have an understanding of the specific careers I worked closely with during my\nfellowship.\nFinally, I would like to incorporate teamwork into my lesson. I was able to participate in\nmeetings with employees from different divisions and I watched how they problem-solved and\nworked together to hypothesis and come to conclusions on future projects. My students will\nhave to work together on hands-on lessons that involve practical math applications that the actual\nengineers work with.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Students will work effectively in cooperative learning groups\n\'Students will be encouraged to learn more about the space program\n\'Students will learn Problem-Solving strategies\n\'Students will learn about exciting career opportunities\n\'Use communication skills\n\'Use hands-on experiments to arrive at outcomes\n\'Learn about the aeronautics of the space shuttle\n\'View and work with practical applications of mathematics in the workplace\n\'Collect, organize, and interpret data\n\'Learn the importance of creative\n\'Be exposed to current technology\n\nPage 3\n\nKratz 2007\n\nImplementation:\nThis project will be about three weeks long (students will not be working on it everyday in a\nrow). Below is a timeline of events.\n\nWeek!:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Have a PowerPoint presentation on my summer experience and what I learned.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide a hands-on activity for reinforcement.\n* Students will do an experiment with a balloon that shows how a rocket engine\nworks\n* Students will record and use equations to see how a rocket would travel with\ndifferent amounts of fuel (we will use air for the balloon)\nWeek 2:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Invite guest speakers from USA to speak with students about the vast possibilities and\nopportunities of the space program.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Allow students the opportunity in class to use the computer to "Meet NASA people"\nhttp://quest.nasa.gov/services/people.html\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide materials needed such as Internet and computer access.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide students with the opportunity to research different careers at the NASA\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Students will write a one page paper on their selected career (rubric will be given)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Students will present their paper to the rest of the class\nWeek 3:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Student will be put into four groups\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Each group will be assigned and specific engineer (Mechanical, Electrical, Software, and\nChemical) that I worked with\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Students will watch interviews from each type of engineers that discuss their job title,\nwhat they do, what education they have had and other interesting facts\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Students will then become that engineer\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In their groups they will work on hands-on math projects that the actual engineers do\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Materials, pictures of the actual engineers doing the same applications, and worksheets\nwill be provided to the groups\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Students will have computers available to work on excel to organize their data\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The groups will work together to finish their project and move on to the next station that\nwill be provided till they completed all four stations, thus experiencing each type of\nengineer\n\nExtension:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If groups move on too quickly, they can begin participation in MATHCOUNTS.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This is a problem of the week given to students from all around the area. Available at\nwww.mathcounts.org\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Students will work on the specific problem with their group when they are finished with\ntheir project\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This activity gives the students the opportunity to compete in a competition that rewards\nthem for their achievements.\n\nPage 4\n\nKratz 2007\n\nAssessment:\nStudent\'s grades will be based on the following scale\n\nIndividual paper: 20 points\nGroup paper/Presentation: 10 points\nMath activities: 40 points\n*These will be based on completion and being mostly correct\nParticipation: 30 points\n\nTools/Materials/Experiences Used:\n*DVD\n*powerpoint presentation of what I learned\n*Balloon\n* String\n*Drinking Straw\n*Tape\n*Worksheets\n*Note cards with career jobs\n* Internet, computer access and listed websites\n*Include parameters, instructions, and rubrics for design.\n*pictures from my experience as a reference\n*Teacher..generated instructions, problems, and rubrics for practical math use\n*Contacts through USA\n*MATHCO[JNTS entrance sheet\n*Knowledge gained through summer experience\n*Include State Standard and Benchmarks\n\nStandards\nMA.A.1.2.l, MA.A.3.3.1, MA.B.2.3.2, MA.B.3.3.1, MA.E.1.3.1, MA.E.2.3.1, MA.E.3.3.1,\nMA.E.3.3.2, MA.E.3.3.3, MA.A.4.3.1, MA.D.1.3. 1, MA.D. 1.3.2, MA.D.2.3.1\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2007 by United Space Alliance, LLC.
