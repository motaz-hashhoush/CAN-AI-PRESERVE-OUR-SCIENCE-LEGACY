A summary of propulsion-related operations cost drivers derived from a two-year study of Shuttle ground operations is presented. Examples are given of the inordinate time and cost of launch operations caused by propulsion systems designs that did not adequately consider impacts on prelaunching processing. Typical of these cost drivers are those caused by central hydraulic systems, storable propellants, gimballed engines, multiple propellants, He and N2 systems and purges, hard starts, high maintenance turbopumps, accessibility problems, and most significantly, the use of multiple, nonintegrated RCS, OMS, and main propulsion systems. Recovery and refurbishment of SRBs have resulted in expensive crash and salvage operations. Vehicle system designers are encouraged to be acutely aware of these cost drivers and to incorporate solutions (beginning with the design concepts) to avoid business as usual and costs as usual.", "title": "Operational cost drivers", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:35:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900019320, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Scholz, Arthur L."}, "organization": {"name": "Boeing Aerospace Co.", "location": "Kennedy Space Center, FL., United States"}}, "id": "d14a5890abb34310ab2a58334fd37f72"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900019320, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dickinson, William J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA John F.
