Pauley\nof Mechanical\nEngineering\n\nObjectives and Potential Impact on Propulsion\n\nSupersonic flow is a topic of strong interest which arises in applications ranging\nfrom the nozzle of a booster rocket to the National Aerospace Plane. Many\ncharacteristics\nof supersonic flow have been studied in detail and are well understood.\nThe transition of a supersonic laminar boundary layer to turbulence, however, has\nbeen very difficult to study. Experimental measurements\nof transition are particularly\ndifficult in rocket nozzle applications because the flow temperatures\nexceed 2300 \xc2\xb0 C.\nIn this case, only temperature\nmeasurements\nalong the outside of the nozzle wall can\nbe made. This yields the wall heat flux within the nozzle but does not indicate flow\nvelocities or temperatures.\nIt also does not provide a tool to predict the performance of\nnozzles.\nTo further investigate the nozzle flow, numerical computations\nare employed.\nThe computations\nproduce complete flow velocity and temperature\nfields within the\nnozzle. As a check these results can be compared with experimental data at the wall.\nOnce an accurate numerical scheme has been validated, it can be used as a design\ntool to predict the performance\nof other nozzle designs without the cost of experimental\ntesting.\nTypically the numerical analysis assumes either a laminar boundary layer or a\nfully turbulent boundary layer which is steady and two-dimensional.\nBoundary layer\ntransition is not considered.\nComputing both the completely\nlaminar boundary layer\nand the completely turbulent boundary layer conditions gives the minimum and\nmaximum wall heat flux possible for a specified geometry.\nWhen the experimental\nheat flux measurements\nlie between these two values, the nature of the boundary\nlayer is unknown.\nThe boundary layer may have transitioned\nfrom laminar to turbulent,\nthree-dimensional\nstructures may be present in the boundary layer, or the inlet flow\nconditions\nmay not be correctly specified in the computation.\nIn the NASA Lewis 1030:1 Area Ratio Nozzle, a series of experiments were\nconducted over a range of chamber pressures (Smith, 1988). The nozzle being tested\nwas a low thrust nozzle design for space applications such as for orbital transfer\nvehicles.\nThe throat diameter of the nozzle was 1 inch and the chamber pressure was\nvaried from 360 to 1004 psi to give a thrust range of 500 to 1200 Ibs. The heat flux\nmeasurements\nwere compared with numerical predictions.\nAt low chamber pressures,\nthe experimental\nheat flux data corresponded\nclosely to the laminar boundary layer\ncomputations.\nWhen higher chamber pressures were tested, the heat flux was found\nto be between the laminar and fully turbulent boundary layer predictions.\nThe\ncharacteristics\nof the boundary layer were not correctly described by the laminar or\nturbulent calculation and therefore the heat flux was not predicted.\nUnder these\nconditions, the nature of the boundary layer can not be inferred from the data.\n\n719\nPRE_Dtl"_31\n\nPAGE _L,_1%K NOT\n\nFILMED\n\nA boundary layer stability analysis can reveal the onset of transition or the\ngrowth of a three-dimensional\nstructure in a laminar boundary layer. In the present\nstudy, a stability analysis will be used to investigate the supersonic boundary layer in a\nrocket nozzle. The study will focus on the NASA Lewis high-area-ratio\nnozzle\nconditions which experimentally\nproduced wall heat flux values between those\npredicted by laminar and turbulent computations.\nThrough a stability analysis, the\nlocation where transition begins and the structure of the most unstable disturbance\ncan be predicted.\nTollmien-Schlichting\n(planar waves) and Taylor-GSrtler\n(longitudinal\nvortices) instabilities will be considered\nas possible transition\nmechanisms.\nThis study will define the boundary layer region which is laminar and\nwhich can be predicted accurately by a two-dimensional,\nsteady, laminar computation.\nEstablishing the structure of the most amplified instability will then lead to an accurate\nmodel of the transition region. On the concave wall of the supersonic nozzle, it is\nexpected that transition will be triggered by the Taylor-GSrtler instability.\nThe stability\nanalysis will determine the wavelength of the disturbance which grows most rapidly.\nA\nthree dimensional\nboundary layer computation\nwill then predict the enhancement\nof\nthe heat flux when a vortex structure of the dominant wavelength is present. These\npredictive models will be compared with the results from high-area-ratio\nnozzle\nexperiments\nreported by Smith (1988). Once validated, the methods developed can\nbe used in predicting the performance of new nozzle designs.\nI1.\n\nCurrent\n\nStatus and Results\n\nThe research program will investigate the boundary layer structure found in\nhigh-area-ratio\nrocket nozzles. The experimental\nresults of Smith, (1988) will be used\nto validate the numerical findings. All chamber pressures tested will be repeated in\nthis numerical investigation.\nAs higher chamber pressure results become available,\nnumerical computations\nwill also be conducted at those conditions.\nThis research\nprogram will yield a predictive tool useful in analyzing other rocket nozzle designs.\nThe research can be divided into three tasks, a boundary layer computation,\na stability\nanalysis and a transition model development.\nThe first task is to compute the laminar boundary layer flow throughout the\nentire length of the nozzle. This provides the mean flow which will be used in the\nstability analysis.\nAt low chamber pressure conditions, the laminar computation\nshould produce heat flux values similar to the experimental results. At high chamber\npressures, the laminar heat flux predicted from the computations will be below the\nexperimental\nvalues. This indicates that the experimental boundary layer begins to\ntransition to turbulent flow. At the high chamber pressure conditions, a stability\nanalysis will be used to predict the location where the laminar boundary layer begins\nto undergo transition.\nThe first stage of the research has been started. A well-tested\ncomputer program is used to solve the compressible\nNavier-Stokes\nequations in the\nentire nozzle. The program uses a flux-splitting\nscheme and has been shown to give\naccurate results for a wide variety of nozzle geometries. Accurate results are also\nexpected for the high-area-ratio\nnozzle of interest.\nAccurate flow inputs and a smooth computational\n\n720\n\ngrid are required for accurate\n\nnumerical results. A chemical equilibrium and composition\nprogram* was used to\ndetermine the chemical composition and properties of the inflow gas using the\nexperimental\nconditions cited by Smith (1988). A frozen flow (constant chemical\ncomposition)\nassumption\nwas then made when computing the flow within the\nsupersonic nozzle. Using tabulated properties for hydrogen-oxygen\nsystems (Svehla,\n1964), constants for the Sutherlands law viscosity expression were found so that the\nviscosity was accurately predicted throughout the entire temperature\nrange of interest.\nA computational\ngrid was produced which includes mesh clustering near the nozzle\nwall in order to resolve the boundary layer (see figure 1). Mesh clustering was also\nadded near the throat where strong velocity gradients are expected.\nTo minimize the\nskewness of the velocity vectors with respect to the grid cells, each spanwise grid line\nis a circular arc which is normal to the nozzle wall.\nPresently we have obtained nozzle results when the chamber pressure is 360\npsi. Within the diverging nozzle, the wall temperature was set to the average wall\ntemperature\nmeasured experimentally.\nThe velocity contours within the supersonic\nportion of the nozzle are shown in figure 2 and the Mach contours near the throat are\nshown in figure 3. In figure 4, the heat flux from the present computations\nis compared\nwith the experimental\nresults. The computational\nresults are approximately\n10%\nabove the experimental\nresults. For the low chamber pressure conditions, the\ncomputational\nresults should accurately predict the experimental\nmeasurements.\nTo get a better comparison between the computational\nand experimental\nresults, several modifications are currently being tested. The accuracy of the\nparameters in the viscosity model is being reexamined and improvements\nin the\nmodel across the operating temperature\nrange will be implemented.\nThe program is\nbeing modified so that a temperature distribution can be specified along the wall.\nCurrently, the wall temperature is set to a constant in the entire supersonic region. The\ngrid resolution near the nozzle wall and in the inviscid flow region is also being tested\nto assure that the numerical solution is grid independent.\nThe modifications\nwill lead\nto a more accurate representation\nof the problem and should also yield more accurate\nheat flux results. When the experimental heat flux results are correctly predicted, it will\nbe inferred that the boundary layer flow within the nozzle has been correctly described\nby the computation.\nAfter producing accurate results at the low chamber pressure, high chamber\nconditions will be computed.\nThe laminar boundary layer results at the high chamber\npressures will be used as the mean velocity profiles for the stability analysis.\nThe\nlocation where the boundary layer begins to transition and the structure of the\ndisturbance\nwhich triggers transition will be determined by the stability analysis.\nIII.\n\nProposed\n\nWork for Coming Year\n\nIn the second phase of this research, the stability of the laminar boundary layer\nwill be tested numerically.\nThe stability analysis will indicate the structure and\nwavelength\nof the disturbance which will be amplified most rapidly and thus which will\n* Referred to as CEC76 and developed\nLewis Research Center.\n\nby S.

Typically transition occurs when the amplitude ratio reaches\ne 9 or el0. The criterion has been found to give an accurate prediction of the transition\npoint when either Tollmien-Schlichting\nor Taylor-GOrtler instabilities cause transition of\ncompressible\nor incompressible\nboundary layers. This method for predicting the\ntransition location is known as the e N method.\nChen, et aL (1985) investigated the transition of the boundary layer in the\ndiverging nozzle of a supersonic wind tunnel.\nTollmien-Schlichting\nand Taylor-GSrtler\ninstabilities\nwere considered along the curved wall. From a boundary layer stability\nanalysis, they found that Taylor-GSrtler\ninstabilities grew more rapidly in the\nsupersonic\nnozzle and caused the transition of the laminar boundary layer on the wind\ntunnel walls. Transition in the experimental facility occurred at the location where the\namplification\namplification\n\nratio from stability analysis had a value of e 9 to e! ]. They suggest\nratio of e 9.2 as a design criterion for transition.\n\nan\n\nTo predict the location where transition begins, the e N method will be used in the\ncurrent investigation.\nThe e N method was successfully used to predict transition in the\nsupersonic\nwind tunnel (Chen, et aL) and the method is expected to give accurate results\nin the current rocket nozzle study since the two applications have similar geometries.\nChen, et aL determined that the Taylor-GSrtler vortices were responsible\nfor the\nboundary layer transition in the wind tunnel nozzle. It is expected that Taylor-GSrtler\nvortices will also trigger transition in the current investigation.\nThe third task in the\nproposed research will be to predict the enhancement of the heat transfer due to the\nlongitudinal vortices. To do this, a vortex array will be added to the boundary layer\ninflow of a three-dimensional\ncompressible\nboundary layer computation.\nThe wall\nheat flux will be determined and comparisons\nwill be made with experimental\nresults.\nReferences\nChen, F.J., Malik, M.R., Beckwith, I.E., (1985), "Instabilities\nBoundary Layers of Low-Disturbance\nSupersonic Nozzles\',\n\nand Transition\nin the Wall\nAIAA Paper 85-1573.\n\nSmith, T.A., (1988) "Boundary Layer Development\nas a Function of Chamber Pressure\nin the NASA Lewis 1030:1 Area Ratio Rocket Nozzle", NASA TM 100917.\nAlso AIAA\nPaper 88-3301.\nSvehla,\nOxygen\n\nR.A., (1964), "Thermodynamic\nSystem", NASA SP 3011.\n\nand Transport\n\n722\n\nProperties\n\nfor the\n\nHydrogen-\n\nFigures\n\n:50-\n\n2.5-\n\nO-\n\n20\n\n0\n\n20\n\nAxial\n\nFigure\n\n1.
