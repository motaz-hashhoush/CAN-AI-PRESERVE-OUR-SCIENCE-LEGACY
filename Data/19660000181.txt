For space applications, these\ndevices pose serious weight problems because of the\nlarge amounts of carrier gas they must dissipate in\neffecting an analysis. Additionally, it is desirable to\nanalyze the gases more rapidly than the typical 5 to\n10 minutes required of prior art.\nThe solution:\nA subminiaturized gas chromatograph weighing\nonly 100 grams and capable of analyzing samples in\na few seconds with a carrier gas flow of one milliliter\nper minute.\nHow it's done:\nA one-microliter gas sample is injected with the\ncarrier gas into a subminiaturized column (microcolumn) where the selective absorption of the constituents by the column packing causes characteristic\ndelays in traversal time, thus separating the constituents. The column is packed with fine-grain (25micron) particles of uniform size that are held in\nplace by electronically machined, sintered stainlesssteel plugs that allow the gas to pass through while\nretaining the particles. The small volume of gas from\nthe microcolumn is passed through a subminiature\ndetector that compares the conductivity of the carrier\ngas and sample with that of the carrier gas alone in\nseparate chambers. Each chamber is equipped with a\n\nplatinum\xe2\x80\x94rhodium thermal conductivity element hot\nwire 0.012-inch long and 10 5 -inch in diameter, each\nforming half of a ratio arm of a Wheatstone bridge.\nChamber volume is 0.1 microliter and power drain is\nonly 0.5 milliwatt.\nNotes:\n1. A microcolumn three inches long will separate\ncertain compound constituents in one second with\na carrier gas flow rate of only one milliliter per\nminute. A typical prior art column would be 10\nfeet long, require a carrier gas flow rate of 60\nmilliliters per minute, and require 10 minutes to\neffect the same separation.\n2. In extraterrestrial exploration, the system could be\nused with a mass spectrometer for the detection of\nlife-supporting compounds.\n3.
