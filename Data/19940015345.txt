The work is the combined\neffort of the Computatioral Chemistry\nand Aerothermodynamics Branches.\nThe principal goal of the work was the prediction of radiation signatures from\nshock layers from ascending vehicles. Some work was also directed at\nunderstanding the chemistry in the plume and plume induced separation.\nThe\nresearch in the two branches was complementary in that both accurate\nmolecular properties and the flow characteristics must be included in the\ncodes that attempt to produce the signatures observed on actual flight\nexperiments.\nNevertheless, the work in the two branches is sufficiently\ndistinct that the contributions from the two are described separately in the\nfinal report.\n\n3\n\nComputational\nA.\n\nStatement\n\nChemistry\nof\n\nthe\n\nBranch\n\nProblem\n\nThe ultimate goal of the research is to be able to prelict the radiation\nsignature of ascending vehicles. This is essential in order to intercept missiles\nduring their boost-phase.\nOur recent work is directed at demonstrating that\ndetection of the hard body in the ultraviolet region where the Earth\'s\nbackground radiation is small is a viable concept.\nThere are two actual flight\nexperiments that have provided very accurate spectral data in the 3-5 km/s\nvelocity range.\nIn collaboration with the aerothermodynamics branch at\nAmes as well as other researchers in this program we have worked on\nunderstanding the physics of shock heated air and in the development of codes\nto predict the radiation signature as a function of altitude and speed.\nThis\nsection of the final report describes the work that was done in the\nCor\xe2\x80\xa2put=a\'onal Chemistry Branch.\nThe molecular data that is needed to predict the bow-shock radiation and to\nunderstand the chemistry and emission from the plume can be divided into\nfive major classes: (1) radiative transition probabilities for molecular\ntransitions that contribute to the signatures; (2) transport properties such as\nthermal diffusion, thermal conductivity and viscosity needed to describe the\nflow in the shock; (3) thermodynamic properties such as heats of formation to\nunderstand the chemistry in the plume; (4) cross sections for electron\nmolecule interactions; and (5) reaction rates for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium reactions.\n\n4\n\nOne of the main objectives of our research program is to compute radiative\nintensity factors for air species that contribute to the radiation signatures of\nhard bodies and exhaust plumes. The NO molecule is one of the key species, as\nit is formed in significant concentrations in shock layers, for example, from\nDuring the three year period of this\nthe reaction of oxygen atoms with N2.\nproposal we have determined accurate transition probabilities for the beta,\nogawa, and epsilon systems of NO. The beta system (B2 FI--X 2 Fl) was particularly\nchallenging theoretically, because the upper state changes from Rydberg to\nvalence character\nin the Franck-Condon\nregion of the\ntransition.\nNevertheless, the radiative lifetimes as a function of vibrational level are in\ngood agreement with recent laser induced fluorescence measurements.\nThe\n4 \'--a 4 1l) do not agree as well\ntheoretical results for the NO ogawa system (b\nwith experiment.\nHowever, we believe the theoretical values are the most\naccurate available for this band system.\nMore recently we have been computing accurate radiative intensity factors\nfor the epsilon system of NO. The epsilon bands are a prominent constituent of\nshock-heated air in the spectral region between 180 and 210 nanometers.\nOur\ntheoretical radiative lifetime of 19 nanoseconds for the low-lying vibrational\nlevels is in good agreement with experiment.\nThus our Einstein coefficients\nfor this band system should represent a substantial improvement over existing\nvalues. These data are being incorporated into the NEQAIR code for computing\nthe radiation from shock-heated air.\nEmission from the Cameron band system of CO is observed in the plumes of\nrockets.\nTo gain insight into the possible mechanism for this long-lived\nchemiluminescence, we have studied the quintet states of CO that are populated\nfrom recombination of ground state atoms.\nOf all the quintet states dissociating\nto ground state atoms, only two are found to be significantly bound. This work\nresulted in the assignment of two new band systems of CO, and it was shown\nthat the emission observed between about 360 and 520 nanometers is due to the\nai\'5n--a\' 3 E+ and a" 5 I--d 3 A transitions.\nThus it is possible that the quintet\nstates, populated through recombination of ground state atoms, serve as\nprecursor states for the formation of the upper state of the Cameron system.\nHowever, the lifetime of this process is too short to explain the long-lived\nchemiluminescence from the Cameron system.\nWe computed the thermodynamic properties of various AI-CI-O radical species\nthat are expected to be present in rocket plumes.\nSpecifically we determined\nthe thermochemical heats of formation of plume species comprised of one or\ntwo aluminum atoms and various numbers of chlorine and oxygen atoms.\nWork is continuing on refining the geometry of the most stable isomer of\nA1202 with an extensive treatment of electron correlation.\n\n5\n\nOur laboratory has been a leader in the computation of accurate transport\nDuring the last three years we considered the interaction of\nproperties.\nnitrogen and oxygen atoms and ions.

The specific goal of\nAerothermodynamics Branch is to develop a computer code that numerically\nreproduces the flight data. This consists of: (1) interpreting the flight data, (2)\ndeveloping the theoretical model that describes the thermochemical\nphenomena occurring in the flow, (3) developing the CFD code that\naccommodates the thermochemical model, (4) run the code for the flight\nconditions, and compare the calculated results with the flight data.\nAerothermodynamics Branch has grants to both Stanford University, with\nProf. Dean Chapman as the principal investigator, and North Carolina State\nUniversity, with Prof. Graham Candler as the principal investigator, to carry\nout portions of the task. These two universities have had other professors, such\nas Prof. Robert MacCormack, and several graduate students to assist the\nprincipal investigators. Ames staff collaborated with these university\npersonnel. In addition, Ames staff collaborated also with Institute for Defense\nAnalysis (IDA), with Dr. Debrah Levin as the principal investigator, which has\nbeen funded independently of Ames.\nThe Bow Shock Ultraviolet Flight I was flown in April 1990, at a flight of about\n3.5 km/s. The spectrometers and monochromators located in the nose region of\nthe vehicle measured a substantial radiation in the ultraviolet region, which\nconsists mostly of nitric oxide (NO) band systems. The Flight 2 was flown in\nFebruary 1991 at a flight speed of about 5.1 km/s. In the second flight, the\nradiation from the plume region was determined as well as the nose region.\nOne radiometer viewed the plume approximately along the centerline, while\nthe other viewed far-field, that is, at 25 degrees off the centerline. The\nintensity of NO radiation in the nose region in the second flight behaved in\nthe same as manner as in the first flight, though at a different level.\nSignificant radiation was detected both from the centerline and the far-field\nregions of the plume.\n\n10\n\nB.\n\nProgress\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nWork\n\nBefore the first flight. it has been predicted, based on existing experimental\nand theoretical dot- that the flowfield will be in thermochemical\nnonequilibrium. "tier the first flight experiment, calculations were carried\nout for the radiative signal received in the blunt nose region of the vehicle\nusing the then standard nonequilibrium codes. The standard codes consisted of\nthe t,,o-temperature nonequilibrium blunt body flow code and the\nnorequilibrium radiation code (NEQAIR). In the low altitude range, namely,\nIetween 40 and 50 km, the calculated radiation intensity agreed approximately\nwith the flight data. However, at higher altitudes, the calculation\nunderpredicted the measurement by at least seven orders of magnitude. This\ntrend was later found to be the same even for the second flight.\nThis discrepancy between the measured and the calculated radiation intensity\nof NO set off concerted efforts within the Branch, IDA, and elsewhere. The\nimmediate response was to attempt explaining the experimental data in terms\nof equilibrium, that is, that the flowfield and radiation mechanism were in\nthermal equilibrium. The equilibrium calculation yielded radiation intensity\nvalues that are uniformly an order of magnitude higher than the flight data at\nall altitudes. The fact that this discrepancy existed at altitudes of 40 to 50 km,\nwhere NEQAIR gave a satisfactory result, was particularly disturbing. This\nreinforced the belief that the flowfield is in nonequilibrium.\nIt was understood at once that the original version of the code NEQAIR is\ninappropriate for this problem because the intended flight speeds are\ndifferent: the code assumes that electrons, prevelant only at high flight speeds\n(above 5 km/s), are responsible for excitation of internal states.\nLevin made a\ncorrection to the NEQAIR code to effect that it is the heavy particles, and not\nelectrons, that cause excitation of electronic states. This correction raised the\ncalculated radiation intensity at high altitudes by an order of magnitude,\nleaving the discrepancy to be two orders.\nThereupon, several hypotheses were developed to explain the still remaining\ndiscrepancy between the theory and the flight data. These included: (1)\nneglecting of Burnett terms in the constituency equations in fluid mechanical\nequations, (2) slip at the wall boundary, (3) inaccuracy in modelling of the\nrotational relaxation behavior, (4) inaccuracy in the value of the cross section\nfor excitation of electronic states of NO, (5) inaccuracy in the spectroscopic\nand radiative parameters for NO band systems, (6) inaccuracy in modelling the\nNO formation processes, and (7) the nonBoltzmann distribution of translational\nmode in the shock wave.\nLumpkin et al first explored the effect of neglecting of Burnett terms. They\nfound that inclusion of Burnett terms improved the theory slightly, that is, by\nan order of a factor of 1.5.\nLumpkin also pioneered maodelling of the rotational relaxation correctly. This\nwas done by extending the existing rotational model by incorporating the\nrecent theoretical and experimental data obtained from the linewidth\nmeasurements. This correction produced a slight improvement. Later, Moreau\net al made a drastic modification to rotational model by incorporating the socalled diffusion model. This correction greatly increased the calculated\n\nradiation\n\nintensity.\n\nThe cross section for electronic excitation of NO molecule was studied\nexperimentally at Stanford Research International (SRI). The work showed\nthat the cross section is very large, that is, about 50 square angstroms.\nBoyd et al explored the question of whether the non-Boltzmann energy\ndistribution is responsible for the discrepancy between the flight data and the\ncontinuum calculations using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)\ntechnique. It was shown first that DSMC technique is at least equivalent to the\ncontinuum approach in the regime where they are expected to be, and that\nindeed the non-Boltzmann distribution is partly responsible for the\ndiscrepancy. But the extent of this effect was found to be uncertain.\nLaux et al and Moreau and Laux investigated the accuracy of the spectroscopic\nand radiation intensity parameters for NO by comparing the calcualted results\nwith the experiment conducted at Stanford University with a plasma torch. By\nusing the spectroscopic and radiative parameters generated recently at\nComputational Chemistry Branch, rather than the set used in the original\nversion of NEQAIR, they were able to demonstrate that the experimental data\ncan be closer reproduced. This led to creation of the NEQAIR-2 code. Use of this\ncode narrowed the discrepancy still further.\nMoreau developed a five-temperature model to describe the process of\nformation and removal of NO molecules in an experiment conducted at\nCALSPAN (W. Wurster\'s experiment). The model so developed can numerically\nrecreate CALSPAN experiment by assigning a vibrational temperature of NO\nmolecule which is different from that of N2 molecule. The new model lowers\nthe calculated radiation intensity at high altitudes.\nThe last two innovations by Moreau have not yet been fully incorporated in\nthe calculation of radiation intensity. However, if one assumes that the crosssection of excitation of NO electronic states is infinitely large, then, by\nincorporating all the improvements made, the calculated intensity agrees\nclosely with the flight data at high altitudes, for the first flight. For the second\nflight, the same approaches overestimates the radiation intensity.\nIn order to study the dynamics of the plume, a theoretical calculation was first\nmade of the fluid flow in the plume. The flight data on the plume region were\ncalculated and compared by Candler et al. A problem exists in that the\nthermochemical state of the rocket effluent at the nozzle exit is uncertain. By\nadjusting the state parameters at the exit, it was shown that the observed\nradiation intensity along the centerline can be numerically recreated. The\nradiation is attributed to that from the solid particulates in the effluent.\nHowever, for the far-field radiometer, that is, that viewing at 25 degrees, the\ncalculation severely underpredicted the measured value. The experimental\ndata can be recreated numerically by first assuming that the radiation\nemanates mostly from the CO Cameron band system, and that the relative\npopulations of electronic states of CO molecules are frozen at the nozzle exit\nconditions. Thus, the far-field radiation signal seems to emanate from the gasphase radiation.\n\n12\n\nC.\n\nSummary\n\nof\n\nMost\n\nimportant\n\nResults\n\n1. It was shown that, by including the Burnett terms in the constituent\nequation, accounting for the non-Boltzmann energy distribution, correctly\nmodelling the NO formation and rotational excitation proccises, and using the\ncorrect transition probabilities for NO radiation, one can numerically\nreproduce the observed radiation of NO in the bow shock region for the flight\nvelocity of 3.5 km/s, provided the rate of excitation of the electronic states\nthrough the vibration-electronic energy transfer is very fast. (For the 5 km/s\nflight, the agreement between calculation and measurement is not as good.)\n2. It was found that the DSMC technique is at least equivalent to the continuum\ntechnique in determination of nonequilibrium radiation.\n3. In the expanding plume flow behind the second flight vehicle, the\nelectronic excitation temperature seems to be frozen at the value at the exit of\nthe nozzle.\n\n13\n\nD.\n\nList\n\nof\n\nPublications\n\nBoyd, I.
