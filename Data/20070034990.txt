b'System engineering the Space Infrared Interferometric Telescope\n(SPIRIT)\nT. Tupper Hyde, David T. Leisawitz, David A. Di Pietro, and Stephen A. Rinehart\nNASA Goddard Spaceflight Center (GSFC), 8800 Greenbelt Rd., Greenbelt, MD 20771\nABSTRACT\nThe Space Infrared Interferometric Telescope (SPIRIT) was designed to accomplish three scientific objectives: (1) learn\nhow planetary systems form from protostellar disks and how they acquire their inhomogeneous chemical composition;\n(2) characterize the family of extrasolar planetary systems by imaging the structure in debris disks to understand how\nand where planets of different types form; and (3) learn how high-redshift galaxies formed and merged to form the\npresent-day population of galaxies. SPIRIT will accomplish these objectives through infrared observations with a two\naperture interferometric instrument. This paper gives an overview of SPIRIT design and operation, and how the three\ndesign cycle concept study was completed. The error budget for several key performance values allocates tolerances to\nall contributing factors, and a performance model of the spacecraft plus instrument system demonstrates meeting those\nallocations with margin.\nKeywords: SPIRIT, InfraredAR, Interferometry, Telescope, System Engineering, Error Budget\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe Space Infrared Interferometric Telescope (SPIRIT) will provide integral field spectroscopy throughout the\nwavelength range 25 - 400 ym with sub-arcsecond angular resolution and hIAh = 3000 spectral resolution in a 1\narcminute instantaneous field of view. Many of the astronomical targets of interest will be resolved for the first time at\nfar-IR wavelengths. SPIRIT\'s spatially resolved spectra will break model degeneracy and enable a new physical\nunderstanding of forming stars and planetary systems, mature planetary systems, and galaxies.\nA single scientific instrument gives SPIRIT its powerful combination of spatial and spectroscopic measurement\ncapabilities. SPIRIT is a Michelson stellar interferometer with a scanning optical delay line for Fourier transform\nspectroscopy and compensation of external optical path length differences. Following beam combination in the pupil\nplane, detector arrays multiplex the area coverage, expanding the field of view from the diffraction spot size of the\nindividual light collecting telescopes to the desired arcminute scale. SPIRIT\'s two telescopes can be moved to sample\nmany interferometric baselines, and therefore spatial structure on all of the angular scales necessary to produce highquality far-IR images. The image resolution, 0.3 (h1100 ym) arcsec, is determined by the maximum baseline length, 36\nm. To attain superlative sensitivity, limited by astrophysical background photon noise, the SPIRIT optics are cooled to 4\nK and sufficiently sensitive detectors will be used.\n\nThe results of a pre-Formulation Phase study of the SPIRIT mission concept are given in a series of papers, of which this\npaper is one. The scientific objectives, measurement requirements, and an overview of the design concept are described\nby Leisawitz et al. (2007).[11Wilson et al. (2007) 12] describes the optics and stray light trades. Budinoff et al.

This paper covers the system engineering of SPIRIT: a walk-through of SPIRIT\'s\ndesign and operation, a re-cap of the three design cycle concept study, and an error budget and performance estimates for\nkey interferometric performance metrics.\n*Tupper.Hyde@nasa.gov; phone 301 286 5386; Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate, NASA GSFC.\n\nFigure 1: Overall functional schematic of the SPIRIT instrument showing how mechanisms (yellow), optics (blue and white), and\nmetrology (green) subsystems interact to bring science light (red) to the detectors. Only the +Y (left) collector telescope is\nshown. There is an equivalent collector telescope on the -Y (right) side not shown. The combiner cryogenic enclosure is the\nlarge box in the center with a 4 K inner shroud where all the small beam science optics and detectors are kept cold.\n\n2\n\nSPIRIT DESIGN OVERVIEW\n\nSPIRIT is a Michelson combining, double Fourier infrared interferometer which operates by collecting science light in\ntwo telescopes separated by a baseline. Figure 1 shows the functional layout of the SPIRIT instrument. Figure 2 shows\nthe full observatory. The baseline is variable from 6 to 36 m by moving the telescopes on trolleys along a boom,\nsymmetrically from the center. The light is compressed and steered into a combining instrument in the center. Here, the\nbeam is further compressed, collimated, and steered into a delay line with multiple passes and channel outputs for final\nbeam combining, focusing, and detector arrays. Shorter wavelength (2 micron) pickoffs from the science beams are\ninterfered to create a zero path delay sensor and an angle sensor. A separate internal metrology laser interferometer\nmeasures the delay line stroke. Thermal barriers and cryocoolers allow for 4 K optics, 1 K final beam combining, and 50\nmK ADR cooled focal planes. A "walk-through" of the instrument is now given by following the science light.. .\n\nACTS wlthermal shields and baffles\n\nIM wlbaffles\n\nACT radiator (both sides of boom)\n\nHigh Gain Antenna\n\nACT solar array (underneath boom)\n\nDeployable Radiators (2)\n\n36 m Boom Structure\n\nBus Solar Array\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\\\n\nFigure 2: The SPIRIT observatory consists of a spacecraft bus supporting an instrument module (IM) and two array\ncollector telescopes (ACTS)on deployable booms. Other deployables are solar array, high gain antenna, and two\nradiators.\n\n2.1 Collector Telescope\nThere are two collector telescopes, on the two ends of the boom. Each collects, compresses, collimates, and steers the\nscience light onto the central beam combiner. The primary telescope is an off axis parabola (OAP) 1.0 m in diameter.\nMaking the primary larger allows better sensitivity or shorter integration times, but adds mass, cryo-cooler power, and\nmakes packaging in the shroud more challenging. At the selected diameter, the optics are fixed; there are no\ndeployments in the optical train. Smaller telescopes also widen the single telescope point spread function and reduce the\nnumber of array pixels required for a given field of view (FOV). The secondary mirror is an OAP on a six-axis\nmechanized mount (the secondary mirror pointing mechanism, SMPM) that corrects for alignment errors, focus, and\nperiodic large pointing corrections. The third optic in the science light chain is the collector steering mirror (CSM), a flat\nmirror which folds the collimated beam and directs it to the central combiner with small stroke, but high bandwidth\npointing correction. The beam is collimated after leaving the secondary; the (de) magnification is 10, making for an\n-10cm SM and CSM. The degree of beam compression is an important trade discussed in Wilson et al. (2007) 12]. An\noptics bench provides the near zero CTE, structural connection for the three telescope optics.\nThe whole collector telescope sits in and on sunshields; details in DiPirro et al. (2007) 14]. The remaining components are\non the warm side. A trolley mechanism periodically adjusts the distance along the boom, thereby setting variable\nbaselines. A collector telescope pointing mechanism provides rough (10 arcsec over 3 deg) pointing of the entire\nassembly to allow both left and right collector telescopes to boresight the same star on the sky. A bearing and distance\nsensor head works with similar units on the central combiner to give coarse relative bearing angles and distance\nmeasurements between the collector and central combiner. Finally, there are electronics on each collector unit: a solar\narray, mechanism drive electronics, and a wireless (perhaps lasercom) data link back to the central combiner electronics.\n\n2.2 Combiner Instrument\n\nThe combiner instrument sits in the center of SPIRIT and receives the science light from the left and right collector\ntelescopes and interferometrically combines them creating multiple bands of output images. A series of shrouds keep the\ninterior optics cold. A thermal baffle surrounds the incoming light port, thereby limiting thermal flux from "viewing"\nwarm parts of the collector. The length and diameter of the thermal baffles, both on the combiner and collector, were a\nmajor thermallstructural system trade; longer tubes perform better but require more mass, cooling power, and sunshield\ncoverage. The incoming beams are compressed further to allow smaller optics in the delay line; again the degree of\ncompression is an important trade covered in Wilson et al. (2007).I\'[ A shutter with a calibration lamp array is placed in\neach leg and used in instrument alignment and calibration. By blocking the light from one arm, a single telescope\nimaging instrument is created from the other arm. A combiner beam steering mirror (CBSM) nulls the angle errors in the\nincoming beam. A dichroic splits off the near infrared (2 micron) light for use in the two science metrology sensors; the\nzero path delay (ZPD) sensor keeps the interferometer on the central combined fringe, and the angle sensor (AS)\nmeasures the overall pointing of the two arms of the interferometer. Choosing the much shorter wavelength near infrared\nlight was a trade in that it provides better angular and path length resolution but requires instrument wavefront error and\npathlength stability to a fraction of that shorter wavelength for acceptable fringe visibility in the ZPD sensor.\nThe science light then enters a delay line with four output ports, one for each wavelength band channel. The shortest\nband (25-50 micron) makes just one pass through the delay length and exits through a wire grid beamsplitter.\nSuccessively longer bands (50-100, 100-200, and 200-400) go through additional passes of delay (3, 5, and 7\nrespectively). The physical stroke of the delay line needs to be just 6.15 cm to provide 86 cm of optical delay to the\nlongest band output. Each channel output beam then goes on to the Michelson beam combiners (beamsplitters of fused\nsilica with coatings) where they are interfered with the light from the other arm and pass into twin detectors with\nfocusing optics and detector arrays. Using both outputs from the beam combination improves sensitivity and provides\nfault tolerance (with 3dB loss of sensitivity upon one detector failure). The detectors are housed in a 1 K shroud and\ncooled with ADRs to 50 mK. Total photometric efficiency (including optical throughput and detector efficiency) is\ngreater than 18 percent. The detectors pixel count is determined by FOV and resolution of a single telescope. A separate\nmetrology interferometer (the path length sensor) measures the differential pathlength between the two arms in the delay\nlines to 0.5 micron resolution. It is fed by a laser in the warm side of the instrument by a fiber. A thermal shield divides\nthe cold side instrument enclosure from the warm side components. The warm-side components of the cryo-cooler and\nADR are below the shield. Two range and bearing metrology sensor heads are aimed at each of the collector telescope\nunits. Instrument electronics include the interfaces for: focal planes, mechanisms, metrology, cryo-cooler, ADR, wireless\n(perhaps lasercom) transceivers to the collector telescopes, instrument command and data handling with 1553 interface\nto the spacecraft.\n2.3 Spacecraft and orbit\n\nSPIRIT will operate from a halo orbit about the Sun-Earth L2 point. This is an attractive location because it provides a\nstable, cold thermal environment and a relatively constant distance from the Earth for communication. The SPIRIT\nobservatory is shown in Figure 2. The full observatory is 4497 kg (incl. 25% contingency). The spacecraft bus supports\nthe combiner instrument module (IM) and the 36m deployable boom with the two collector telescopes. Thermal shields\nfor the collector telescopes and the IM provide for a +I-20 deg field of regard (FOR) in two axes about the line to the\ntarget. In SPIRIT\'S L2 halo orbit, this provides full coverage target around the ecliptic plane and up to +I- 20 degrees\ndeclination. This FOR selection was a strong trade parameter in celestial coverage versus size of the thermal shields; at\n20 deg the thermal shields do not need to be deployable. The spacecraft uses deployable booms, radiators, solar arrays,\nand high gain antenna to fit in the launch fairing.\nThe spacecraft bus has the typical subsystems and is similar, but smaller, than the JWST spacecraft bus. It consists of a\nbox structure approximately 1.5 m on a side with electronics and propellant tank mounted inside and deployables and\nthrusters mounted outside. The propulsion system is hydrazine monopropellant. The attitude control system (ACS)\nconsists of six reaction wheels of 100 Nms each providing a slew rate of 1 degimin and supports an average collection\nrotation rate of 0.63 r o a r . Star trackers and gyros provide sensing for the coarse ACS control of 5 arcsec. This puts\nguide stars on the instrument\'s angle sensor for further accuracy. The communication system uses Ka-band for high data\nrate (100 Mbps) link and S-band for a contingency low data rate link. The electrical power system (EPS) consists of a\ndeployed solar array panel, battery, and power management electronics. The EPS supports the spacecraft systems and\nprovides 1081 W for the IM (separate power systems on the collector telescopes have their own fixed solar arrays).\n\n2.4 Operation\n\nSPIRIT will be launched on a medium EELV with a 5 m fairing directly to its L2 transfer orbit. The spacecraft performs\nsmall correction and halo orbit insertion burns. SPIRIT will operate for 3 years with a 5-year goal (propellant for 5\nyears). Orbit station keeping maneuvers are performed infrequently (every few months). The primary driver for\noperations .is science efficiency, that is, percent of total time spent integrating on detectors. Slewing to new targets,\ntrolley positioning, alignments, calibration, and data downlink time must be minimized. Data downlinks occur every\nother day for two hours at 100 Mbps to DSN allowing 247 Gbitslday of science and housekeeping data (includes\nencoding overhead, margin and assumes 2:l compression on science data).\nA typical observation begins by slewing to the new target, typically 10 degrees away in less than 2 hours. The spacecraft\nspins slowly axis towards target. Calibrations and alignments take a few minutes. The target is observed for % a\nrevolution, and then the trolley moves to a new position (while continuing to spin). Trolley spacing is dependent on\ndesired U-V plane coverage but typically consists of 31 positions with baselines from 6 to 36 m. Downlinks interrupt\nscience observations. During integration, the delay line is continuously stroked over the full range during the time the\ncollecting telescopes have moved one half of a diameter tangentially due to spacecraft rotation. Images are read from\nthe 8 focal planes (2 each of the 4 channels) which creates an on- board data set with baseline, rotation angle, and delay\nline stroke per image read. Frame read rates depend on stoke rate and channel and are is 573 Hz on the short wavelength\nchannel typically. This results in a total uncompressed raw science data rate of 5.4 Mbps. This data is post-processed on\nthe ground to create a double Fourier data set with high spatial and spectral resolution. Total integration time depends on\nthe desired sensitivity but typically is 24 hours of detector integration in 28.2 hour (29 hour with margin) total\nobservation for 85 percent science efficiency and a 0.85 targetslday mission planning number.\n\n3\n\nSYSTEM ENGINEERING THE SPIRIT DESIGN CONCEPT\n\nA SPIRIT pre-formulation study was conducted from August to December 2004 at NASA GSFC with science and\nengineering team partners. The objective was to develop one viable, not necessarily optimized, concept for\naccomplishing the SPIRIT mission. The goal was to maximize science return within given constraints, determine\ncredible estimates for life cycle cost and development schedule, and identify program risks. This intense concept design\nphase built on previous instrument and mission design studies and was done for three point design cycles and trades.\n\nLO\n\nMission Life Cycle Cost\n\nFigure 3 : The system engineering approach to the SPIRIT conceptual design was to use three design cycles. The A\ndesign was done first based on the PI\'s desired configuration. The B design was done second and met only the science\n"floor" requirements. This allowed informed trades in cost and performance so the final C design cycle could be targeted\nto for the most science return given the constraints on mission life cycle cost and development schedule.\n3.1 A three design cycle concept study\nThe system engineering approach taken was to bracket the likely solution in first two design cycles, then interpolate to\ndetermine technical capability (and resulting science return) that corresponds to the given cost and development schedule\nconstraints of the Origins Probe mission class. Figure 3 shows graphically the idea of a three design cycle concept study.\nThe first (A) design cycle used the PI\'s desired configuration as the starting point; an ambitious "Cadillac" design. The\nsecond (B) design cycle evaluated the science "floor" mission; the point below which the science team believed science\n\nreturn would not justify the investment; an austere design. Trades were then introduced by each subsystem design lead\nand integrated by the instrument and mission system engineers to create a trade sensitivity and breakpoint matrix with\noverall system capabilities tied to costs and packaging feasibility. While the engineering team was conducting trades in\npreparation for targeting the final (C) design cycle parameters, the science team w a s completing a design reference\nmission (DRM) with 15 "use cases" defined by individual science team champions. Established SPIRIT primary and\nsecondary science goals were used to weight the science utility the use cases. Each use case then derived it\'s science\nrequirements: field o f view, field o f regard, number o f fields, wavelength range, spatial resolution, spectral resolution,\nand sensitivity. Evaluation of the D R M information allowed for informed targeting of the C design cycle parameter to\nget the most completion of the D R M with a mission concept that would meet constraints. Engineering and science\nteams then met with the PI to define the targeted critical parameters for the final (C) design cycle. The results of the C\ndesign were those presented in the previous section. Table two lists critical parameters for the A, B, and C design cycles\nfor side-by-side comparison.\n\n3.2 Lessons learned\nIn analyzing the trades results from the A and B design cycles and pushing hard on the science driving use cases o f the\nDRM, w e found a few important things that were key elements o f the C design: 1) high spectral resolution was very\nattractive, even more so than high spatial resolution or wavelengths longer than 400 micron; 2) fixed (non-deployed)\ntelescopes and sunshield elements save money, fairing volume, risk, and integration and test headaches; 3) boom length\nis very attractive and was maximized given the available fairing volume, even at the expense of telescope diameter.\nTable 2: Comparing key requirements and key configuration aspects o f the three design cycle concept study for\nSPIRIT. The C design used information learned from the A and B designs, trades and engineering breakpoints, along\nwith science utility metrics derived from the science team\'s design reference mission.\n\nSpectral Range\nAngular Resolution\nSpectral Resolution\nField of View\nSensitivity\nNumber of Observations\n\nSky Access\nImage Quality\n\nMission Life (on station)\nScience Capability\nScience Field of View\nObserving Rotation Rate\nScience Data Collect Rate\nOptics Temperature\nScience Detector Temp\nPhase B Start to Launch\nScience Telescopes\nTelescope Diameter\n\nA-Design (Ambitious)\n25-800 microns\n(5 octave bands)\n.04 arcsec @ 25 microns (60 m\n\nB-Design (Austere)\n50-400 microns\n(3 octave bands)\n.21 arcsec @ 50 microns (24\n\nC-Design (Final, Targetted)\n25-400 microns\n(4 octave bands)\n.07 arcsec @ 25 microns (36 m\n\nR >= 1000\n(860 mm ODL scan range,\noptical pathllongest band)\n2.5 arcmin\n(100 x 100 pixels)\n.35 to .70 mJ @ le6 sec\n(3m collectors, 5e-19 WIrtHz\ndetector noise)\n3600 (2lday for 5 years, 400 Hz\nframe rate, 574 Gbits stored, 47\nMbps downlink, 4hr/day, 10:1\ncomp.)\n+I- 20 from anti-sun\n(deployed sun shades)\nFull u,v 95% visibility\n(1200 Nms momentum, 0.65\nmicron RMS wavefront match,\n0.25 micron metrology)\n5 years\n\nR >= 100\n(5 1 mm ODL scan range,\noptical pathllongest band)\n1.0 arcmin\n(8 x 8 pixels)\n3 to 6 mJ @ le6 sec\n( l m collectors, 5e-19 WIrtHz\ndetector noise)\n1800 (llday for 5 years, 20 Hz\nframe rate, 6.3 Gbits stored,\n1.0 Mbps downlink, 2hrlother\nday, 2: 1 comp.)\n+I- 20 from anti-sun\n(fixed sun shades)\nFull u,v, 90% visibility\n(< 100 Nms momentum,\n2.6 micron RMS wavefront\nmatch, 1.0 micron metrology)\n5 years\n\nR >= 3000\n(860 mm ODL scan range, optical\npathllongest band)\n1.0 arcmin\n(14 x 14 pixels)\n3 to 6 mJ @ le6 sec\n( l m collectors, 5e-19 WlrtHz\ndetector noise)\n900 (.85lday for 3 years, 793 Hz\nframe rate, 492 Gbits stored, 100\nMbps downlnk, 2hrlother day, 2:l\ncomp.)\n+I- 20 from anti-sun\n(fixed sun shades)\nFull u,v, 90% visibility\n(-300 Nms momentum,\n1.3 micron RMS wavefront match,\n0.5 micron metrology)\n3 Years wlpropellant for 5 yrs\n\n2.5 arc min\n0.80 revihr (8.0 revlobs)\n82Mbls (derived)\n4K\n0.05 K\n\n1.0 arc min\n0.45 revihr (9 revlobs)\n57 kbls (derived)\n->4 K ( to 400 micron max)\n0.05 K\n\n1.0 arc min\n.63 revihr (1 5 revlobs) avg.\n5.37 Mbls (derived)\n4K\n0.05 K\n\n2 Off-Axis\n3.0 m A-focal\n\n2 Off-Axis\n1.0 m A-focal\n\n2 Off-Axis\n1.0 m A-focal\n\nGround Contacts\nInstrument Cold Mass\nObserv.

The table below shows the visibility budget for SPIRIT at 2 and 25 microns.\n\nThese budgeted values lead to a 94 percent visibility at 25 microns wavelength and 26 percent visibility at 2 microns\nwavelength. Pupil area overlap contributes 2 percent loss of visibility. Amplitude, polarization, and polarization shift\nmatch all contribute about 1 percent visibility loss for each of these three terms. The beam wavefront matching terms\n(OPD due to piston, OPD due to tilt, and OPD due to differential WFE) contribute to negligible (0.8 percent) visibility\nloss at 25 microns about 69 percent visibility loss at 2 microns. Obviously it is the 2 micron metrology light case that\ndrives fringe visibility requirements, so we will focus on that. Some of these sources of visibility loss listed above are\nmitigated through the use of controls as will be described in this document. There are, however, several additional\nsources of visibility loss that cannot be compensated for by mechanisms. These include polarization, polarization shift,\namplitude matching, and optical surface (WFE) errors. We detail information about these at the end of this document,\nand discuss how the engineering of SPIRIT provides estimates on these.\n4.1 Telescope Pointing: Bearing sensor and telescope pointing actuation\nThe requirement on the pointing of the individual collectors is determined by two factors; the unvignetted field of view\nof the telescope and the angular range of motion of the collector steering mirror. The telescopes will be accurately\npointed by the spacecraft augmented with the rangehearing sensor to determine the position and orientation of the two\ntelescopes relative to the spacecraft. The telescope mounts are then mechanized to move the entire telescope assembly.\nIt is assumed that for this purpose, the accuracy of telescope pointing will be the limitation, and that the accuracy of the\nbearing sensor will be more than sufficient to achieve the required level of pointing. The field-of-view requirement is\n\nthat the two telescopes should include an identical 1 arcmin FOV but have an unvignetted and unabated FOV of +I- 3\narcminutes. The second requirement is due to the collector steering mirror; the telescopes must have absolute pointing to\nwithin the range of the collector steering mirror. We anticipate that the collector steering mirror range of motion will be\nof order of at least 10 arcmin, which again does not provide a strong constraint on the telescope pointing. More\nimportantly than this, the telescope pointing requirement leads to the required size of the collector steering mirror. The\ncollector steering mirror (and the secondary) must be sized to accommodate the desired 1 arcminute FOV plus the\nadditional FOV due to allowable telescope mispointing. For large uncertainties in the FOV, this could lead to significant\ngrowth in the size of these optics. Ultimately, we have assumed that the telescopes can be pointed to within 1 arcminute\nof the desired telescope FOV center.\nThe pointing of the telescope also needs to be stable between corrections, and any uncertainties in the pointing need to\nhave amplitudes that are correctable through the use of the bearing sensor and the collector steering mirror. The thermal\nbending of the boom was shown by integrated analysis to be 0.3 mm static with the amplitude being reduced by an\nunknown factor for the rotating case. This equates to a sinusoidal variation of the telescope pointing of 3.4 arcsec at the\nrevolution frequency. So the "good" FOV of the telescope must handle the 1 arcmin of initial pointing error as well as\nthe 3.4 arcsec of thermal error that will come with SPIRIT rotation. The time varying thermal and spacecraft attitude\npointing error will be removed downstream of the collector telescope. The requirements for this are rolled into the next\nsection on controlling beam alignment using the bearing sensor and collector steering mirror.\nTelescope polntlng\n1 Telescope polntlng, percent of FOV\n60 Telescope polntlng\n-Instrument\nCenter (IM) oolntlna error\n~,\nfrom RBS angle error\nfrom telescope polntlng mechan~sm\nfrom motlon not measured b y RBS\n\n5 Spacecraft polntlng error ( 1 slgma)\n5 Spacecraft to I M alignment error (max phys~cal)\n4 85E-05 Allowed telescope polntlng error (rnax physlcal)\n10.00 Allowed telescope polntlng error (max physlcal)\n4 85E-05 Allowed RBS angle error (max physlcal)\n10 Allowed RBS angle error (max physlcal)\n5 Allowed struct deform. between RBS and telescope\n5 Allowed callbratlon error of RBS t o telescope\n\narcsec\narcsec\narcsec\narcsec\narcsec\narcsec\narcsec\narcsec\nrad\narcsec\nrad\narcsec\narcsec\narcsec\n\n1 estlmate from ST (spec\n1 guess\n\nIS\n\n5)\n\n4.8E-06 calc\n1 from MECH report\n4.8E-05 calc\n10 from METR report\n1 guess\n1 guess\n\nThe flowdown of requirements through the telescope pointing error budget of 60 arcsec is shown above. The values are\nmax and taken to be worst case (contributions are summed, not RSSed). The majority of the budget is given to the RBS\nangle sensor error and the rest to telescope pointing mechanism, RBS to telescope calibration error, RBS to telescope\nstructural stability. There is 16 percent unallocated margin.\n4.2 Beam Alignment: Bearing sensor and collector steering mirror actuation\n\nOnce the telescopes are accurately pointed, we have to use the collector steering mirror to accurately place the two\nbeams on their respective combiner steering mirrors. Misalignment of the optical train by a certain percent of the beam\nwill cause a mis-overlap of the combined beam in the pupil plane. A downstream pupil stop was considered to mitigate\nthis, but this is problematic as the physical pupil size changes as the trolley is moved in and out. The beam alignment is\ndone in an open-loop fashion, making use of the bearing sensors. The bearing sensors, as designed, should accurately\nmeasure the position (translation) and pointing (angle) of the collector telescopes. This information is fed back to the\ncollector steering mirrors, which make use of the information to steer the beam to the combiner steering mirrors. There\nis no feedback control to ensure that this pointing is accurate. The accuracy of the collector steering mirror, therefore, is\nrequired to at least as good as the accuracy of the bearing sensors, since we do not have any way of determining if fine\ncorrections are necessary. The accuracy for these components is determined by the need to align the two beams on their\nrespective combiner steering mirrors. We have assumed that this coalignment needs to be 2% of the beam diameter at\nthe combiner steering mirror. This requirement is most stringent at the longest, The collector steering mirror will update\nits position at roughly 2 Hz based upon the readings from the bearing sensor, in order to account for possible flexure in\nthe boom due to thermal deformation (estimated by integrated thermal struclral analysis to be 3.4 arcsec). Effects\noccurring faster than 2 Hz are beyond the scope of this mechanism (and, in fact, all our mechanisms) and should\ntherefore be minimized in other ways.\n\nBeam Alignment Budget\n0.02 MIS-overlap ratlo o f area\n152.360 Size o f beam a t ZPD combiner\nAllowed b e a m w a l k (single axis) a t combiner entrance\nContribution f r o m RBS translational error\nContribution f r o m RBS angle error\nContribution f r o m motion n o t measured b y RBS\n0.1 C o n t r ~ b u t i o n r o m collector steering error\nf\n10.347198l~argin\n1 8 0 0 0 Effective distance f r o m collector t o combiner\n5.56E-06 Allowed\n1.15 Allowed\n5.56E-05 Allowed\n11.46 Allowed\n1 Allowed\n0.30 Allowed\n0.30 Allowed\n\ncollector steering error ( m a x physical)\ncollector steerlng error ( m a x physical)\nRBS angle error ( m a x physical)\nRBS angle error ( m a x physical)\nRBS translation error ( m a x physical)\ncalibration error o f RBS t o optics train\nstruct. deform. between RBS a n d optics train\n\nmm\n\nEstimate\n\nmm\nmm\n\nrad\narcsec\nrad\narcsec\nmm\nmm\nmm\n\n4.8E-06 calc\n1 f r o m MECH report\n4.8E-05 calc\n1 0 f r o m METR report\n1 f r o m METR report\n0.3 guess\n0 . 3 guess\n\nThe flowdown of requirements through the beam alignment error budget of 3.0 mm is shown above. The values are max\nand taken to be worst case (contributions are summed, not RSSed). The majority of the budget is given equally to four\nerrors. Max allowed requirements are: RBS angle sensor error (1 1 arcsec), RBS translation error (1.0 mm), collector\nsteering mirror error (1.15 arcsec), RBS to optics train calibration error (.30 mm), RBS to optics train structural stability\n(.30 mm). There is 11 percent unallocated margin.\n4.3 Tilt: Angle sensor and combiner steering mirror actuation\nOnce the beams from the two arms are aligned to a small fraction of a beam diameter at the combiner steering mirror,\nthere remains the possibility that the two beams, as they enter the combiner, are coming in at an angle. This leads to a\nrelative wavefront tilt between the two beams, and a subsequent loss in visibility related through (The Jinc function,).\nFurthermore, this angular tilt will lead to a small offset in the positions of the two beams as they impinge upon the\ndetectors, leading to further loss in visibility. In order to minimize this effect, we require that the angle sensor accurately\nmeasure the relative wavefront tilt between the two beams and feed this back to the combiner steering mirrors which will\nremove the tilt. This will limit the visibility loss due to wavefront tilt. As with the collector steering mirror, the\ncombiner steering mirrors will be updated at 2 Hz based upon the readings from the angle sensor. This, unlike the\ncollector steering mirror and the bearing sensor, is a closed-loop process, as the angle sensor will provide effectively\nimmediate feedback on the relative position of the combiner steering mirror. This image motion compensation (IMC)\nloop will have a 0.2 Hz bandwidth (unity gain frequency) with a 2 Hz sample rate (10 x rule of thumb for acceptable\nloop phase loss).\nEst~mate\n\n1\n\nContr~but~on angle sensor nolse\nfrom\nContr~but~on actuatton nolse\nfrom\n0.051~ontr1butions measured at angle sensor\nnot\nfrom unrejected disturbances\n0.50\n2.00\n0.50\n0.20\n\nlntegratlon tlme of ZPD sensor\nAngle sensor readout rate\nlntegratlon tlme of angle sensor\nBandw~dth Image motion compensation loop\nof\n\narcsec\narcsec\n\narcsec\nsec\nHZ\nsec\nHz\n\n0.10 Allowed angle sensor NEA ( 1 sigma) In band\narcsec\n1.06 Allowed comb~ner\nsteerlng mlrror nolse (1 slgma, physclal), out of bancarcsec\n0.35 Allowed collector steerlng mlrror nolse ( 1 slgma, physclal), out of band arcsec\n0.03 Allowed cal~brat~on\nerror of ZPD tllt to AS\narcsec\narcsec\n0.03 Allowed stab~l~ty ZPD tllt to AS\nof\n0.14 Allowed unrelected errors at .02 Hz (ACS)\narcsec\n0.02 Allowed unrejected errors at l/rev (thermal)\narcsec\n0.06 Allowed other unrejected tllt d~sturbances\nOltter)\narcsec\n20.00 Reject~on\nfactor at .02 Hz\n2.70 Allowed open loop errors at .02 Hz (ACS)\narcsec\n0.00077 l l r e v frequency\nHZ\n13365.30 Relection factor at l l r e v freq\narcsec\n200.48 Allowed open loop errors at l l r e v freq (thermal)\n1049.71 Allowed open loop errors at lfrev freq (thermal)\nmm\nmas\n63.64 Allowed polntlng jltter (above control bandw~dth)\n\n0 . 1 from MET report\n0.3 from MECH report\n0.3 from MECH report\n0.03 guess\n0.03 guess\n0.0045 calc\n0.01543 CalC\n0.0001 calc\n0.09 from ST and Gyro KF\n3.43775 calc\n0.3 FROM STOP report\n0 . 1 from RWA Imbalance\n\nThe flowdown of requirements through the differential tilt error budget of 0.23 arcsec (1 sigma, on the sky) is shown\nabove. The values are taken to be 1 sigma over the integration time of the ZPD sensor (contributions RSSed). The\nbudget is divided equally between the sensor noise, actuation noise, and unrejected disturbances. There is also a small\n\ncontribution from the non-common path errors associated with the sensor (the angle sensor) not being co-located with\nthe sensitive instrument (the ZPD interferometer). There is 1 1 percent unallocated margin.\nFrom this allocation, 1 sigma allowed requirements are: angle sensor noise (.lo arcsec), and unrejected (out of band)\ncollector steering mirror noise (1.06 arcsec, physical = 0.07 arcsec on sky) and collector steering mirror noise (0.35\narcsec physical = 0.07 arcsec on sky). These are 1 sigma noise allocations over the 2 Hz bandwidth of the ZPD sensor.\nThey may be due to quantization (divide by square root of 12) or amplifier noise. Further, the allowed calibration and\nstability (between calibrations) requirements for alignment of the angle sensor null point to the true ZPD zero tilt\ncondition are 0.03 arcsec each. Finally the unrejected tilt disturbances are allocated to three categories. Those\ndisturbances at .02 Hz (ACS and ODL imbalance induced) are rejected by the image motion compensation by a factor of\n20 and can therefore be up to 2.7arcsec open loop (spacecraft ACS is speced at 0.3 arcsec, 1 sigma and is predicted to do\n0.09 arcsec, 1 sigma). Those disturbances at the once per SPIRIT revolution (thousands of seconds) are rejected by over\n13,000 and can therefore be up to 200 arcsec (covers the 3.4 arcsec predicted thermal pointing motion at llrev). Finally,\ntilt disturbances at frequencies higher than the image motion compensation bandwidth of 0.2 Hz are given a total\nallocation of 63 mas (structural damping of 0.5 percent and well balanced RWAs allow the vehicle to meet this with\nsignificant margin, prediction is 0.1 mas due to RWA imbalance).\n4.4 OPD: ZPD sensor and pathlength compensation\n\nOnce the beams are aligned and the wavefronts parallelized, there may remain a piston error difference between the two\narms. This error is mitigated through use of the ZPD sensor and the pathlength compensator. The ZPD sensor makes\nuse of a NIR guide star in the FOV of the instrument. The fringe pattern from this star is scanned to find the zero path\ndifference (ZPD) point, and is then shifted to place the first zero-crossing of the fringe pattern in delay line space. Using\nthe position of this zero-crossing, the pathlength compensation mechanism is used to adjust the total pathlength\ndifference of the two arms of the interferometer (including the delay line) to 112 of the optical delay distance (i.e. so that\nthe ZPD for the center of the FOV is at the center of the delay line range of travel). Then, as the delay line scans through\nthe fringe pattern, the ZPD sensor monitors the zero-crossing, adjusting the path length compensator to keep the total\npath length of the two arms (prior to the ZPD sensor - i.e. prior to the delay line) constant. The sensor and mechanism\ntogether keep the total optical delay shift to less than a fraction of a wave of science light. The control must also stabilize\nthe metrology (near IR) light on the ZPD sensor to a fraction of it\'s wavelength over the integration time of the ZPD\ndetector readout (0.5 sec) in order maintain visibility on the ZPD sensor fringe. The overall situation is actually a bit\nmore stringent than this, as we require that the total piston error be small, and the total piston error consists of both errors\nprior to the delay line, and errors within the delay line itself. The latter are discussed in a later section.\nOPD Bud et\n0.2 OPD rms at ZPD sensor over lntegratlon tlme\nC c o n t r i b u t t o n from ZPD sensor noise\n0.10I~ontributlon\nfrom actuation nose\n0.11 Contribut~on\nfrom unrejected disturbances\n0.021 Margin\n2.00 ZPD readout rate\n0.50 inteqratlon tlme of ZPD sensor\n0.20 ~ a n d w ~ d of ~ m a g e\nth\nmotlon compensation loop\n\nI\n\nu\n\n0.10 Allowed ZPD sensor NEA ( I slgma) In band\n0.05 Allowed pathlength compensatlon nolse ( 1 slgma, physclal), c\n0.09 Allowed unrejected errors at .02 Hz (ACS)\n0.07 Allowed other unrejected errors (ytter + negllg~ble\nthermal)\n2000.00 Rejection factor at .02 Hz (~nclude tlme factor)\nInt\n176.00 Allowed open loop errors at .02 Hz (ACS)\n4.89E-06 Allowed open loop ACS polntlng at .02 Hz\n1.01 Allowed open loop ACS polntlng at .02 Hz\n0.07 Allowed OPD litter (above control bandw~dth)\n\nmlcron\nmlcron\nmlcron\nmlcron\nmlcron\nHZ\nsec\nHz\nmlcron\nmlcron\nrnlcron\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0.00785\n0.022\n\nmlcron\nrad\narcsec\nmlcron\n\n15.708 calc\n4.4E-07 calc\n0.09 from ST and Gyro K F (0.3 spec)\n0.022 from RWA ~mbalance\n\n\' bani mzcron\n\nfrom METR report\nfrom MECH report, 1 slgma\ncalc\ncalc\n\nThe flowdown of requirements through the OPD error budget for the ZPD sensor of 0.20 micron (1 sigma) is shown\nabove. The values are taken to be 1 sigma over the integration time of the ZPD sensor (contributions RSSed). The\nbudget is divided equally between the sensor noise, actuation noise, and unrejected disturbances. There is 10 percent\nunallocated margin.\nFrom this allocation, 1 sigma allowed requirements are: ZPD sensor noise (.lo micron), and unrejected (out of band)\npathlength compensation noise (0.05 micron physical = 0.10 micron optical). The pathlength compensation mechanism\nnoise is 1 sigma over the 2 Hz bandwidth of the ZPD sensor. It could be due to quantization (divide by square root of 12)\nor amplifer noise. Finally the unrejected OPD disturbances are allocated to two categories. Those disturbances at 0.02\nHz (ACS and ODL imbalance induced) are rejected by the image motion compensation by a factor of 20 (with another\nfactor of 10 to account for the ratio of motion frequency to integration frequency) and can therefore be up to 176 micron\n\nopen loop. This is equivalent to 1.01 arcsec over the 36 meter baseline (ACS is speced at 0.3 arcsec, 1 sigma and is\npredicted to do 0.09 arcssec, 1 sigma). And tilt disturbances at frequencies higher than the image motion compensation\nbandwidth of 0.2 Hz are given a total allocation of 0.07 microns (structural damping of 0.5 percent and well balanced\nRWAs allow the vehicle to meet this with significant margin, prediction is 0.02 microns OPD from wheel imbalance).\nThose disturbances at the once per SPIRIT revolution (thousands of seconds) are rejected by such as huge amount as to\nbe negligible and are not included in the budget.\nAs mentioned above, piston error in the system consists of both piston error outside of the combiner (pre-delay line) and\nwithin the delay line itself (due to vibration, uneven motion, etc.). The latter should be a small effect, and as such, rather\nthan having to control the delay line motion to better the same level of accuracy as the pathlength compensation\nmechanism, we need merely to have knowledge of the pathlength within the delay line to a small fraction of a fringe.\nFor this purpose, knowledge of this path length to better than a small fraction of a fringe should be sufficient, say 0.5\nmicrons. This should be easily achievable with laser metrology systems. It is also critical to calibrate any non-common\npath OPD between the ZPD sensor and each science detector. This is easily achieved by observing a bright point source\non axis in all science detectors and the ZPD sensor simultaneously. The stability of that non-common path calibration\nshould be quite stable (much better than the required 0.5 micron) due to the cold and very stable instrument module\noptics bench structure.\n4.5 WFE (Optical surface errors)\n\nA single aperture telescope shows a spread in the point spread function due to rough optical surfaces. An interferometer\nis also susceptible to optical surface errors, but is more sensitive to them because they cause the wavefront to have phase\nvariations. These phase variations are the equivalent to local "piston" errors that do not match between one arm and the\nother, and therefore lead to a loss of fringe visibility. In general, for a given optical surface, the visibility loss due to\nwhere s is the RMS of the difference in wavefront error (WFE) between the\nsurface roughness is given by 1- e-(2"\'A)2,\n)~\narms. This is approximately a loss of ( 2 ? ~ o / hfor small 6. If we assume that we have eight reflective surfaces prior to\nthe beam combination. The metrology light at 2 microns needs to have a total visibility loss due to wavefront error that is\nbetter than 50%. This leads to a requirement that the total wavefront error from the surfaces is less than 0.2 microns.\nRemember that it is the differential WFE between the arms that matters. WFE from aberrations that are part of the design\nare identical in both arms and therefore not part of this budget (but are part of the Strehl and encircled energy\ncalculations).\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis paper showed the basic design and operations for the SPIRIT concept. The three design cycle approach for\nconceptual design was explained. The science team\'s design reference mission was used to guide the design process\nthrough requirement specifications and performance appraisals. Interferometric performance error budgets were flowed\ndown from visibility requirements and allocated to subsystems (optics, sensors, controls, mechanisms, and structures).\nPerformance estimates were then rolled back up based on the actual component performance reported in subsystem\ndesign documents. For science light at 25 microns, a 98 percent visibility is estimated against a 90 percent requirement.\nFor the more stringent near infrared metrology light at 2 microns, a 47 percent visibility is estimated against a 25 percent\nrequirement.\nThe SPIRIT study team accomplished the goal, which was to demonstrate the scientific promise and technical viability\nof a space-based far-IRI submillimeter spatial and spectral interferometer as a candidate Origins Probe mission. The IR\ncommunity recommended SPIRIT in its "Community Plan," and the mission is well aligned with NASA programmatic\nand science objectives.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
