ODC is an open-source platform for processing satellite data. We have developed software products and tools around the core ODC that would help users perform machine learning on EO satellite data. \n\nThe recent United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Agenda provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and for the planet, considering our current situation and helping to create a plan. The core of this agenda is a set of seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which represent an urgent call for action by all countries - both developed and developing - in a global partnership. The CEOS SEO team has recently developed and released a set of innovative Jupyter notebooks addressing UN SDGs 6.6.1 (spatial extents of water-related ecosystems), 11.3.1 (ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate), and 15.3.1 (proportion of land that is degraded over total land area). These notebooks\nempower users by providing features that will assist with streamlining analysis ready data retrieval, processing, and visualization. We have recently incorporated several machine learning techniques in these notebooks.\n\nIn this paper, we present the lessons learned from our experience on classifying land using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques using ODC framework for UN SDGs. We identify the current limitations of ODC to seamlessly support machine learning techniques. We propose features that would help machine learning, specifically within the ODC framework. We propose a thematic indexing/loading of data for both unsupervised learning as well as data annotation/labeling pipeline. Currently, ODC supports machine learning by separating data-management from the analysis process. It works as a mechanism to load cubes of data. ODC does not natively support features that are vital in machine learning such as\nvalidation splits, fair/balanced sampling, establishing load size constraints, etc. We believe that our proposed features will empower users by providing features that bring machine learning techniques closed to ODC. Enhancements to ODC to better accommodate machine learning techniques can assist in fulfilling UN SDGs such as 6.3.2, 6.4.2, 6.6.1, 11.3.1, 14.1.1, 15.1.1, 15.3.1, and 15.4.2.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20200005395, "endDate": "2019-10-11T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "38ca4396b5dc5e7b8e3ab7a00047cac9", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "location": "Bethesda, Maryland, United States"}}, "meetingId": "77ee3660630b47bbae651cacac241288", "id": "40acf8b26c5043f1bf017bd12c3f32ad"}], "name": "21st William T.
