Abstract (Limit: 200 words)\n\nA relationship is derived, on a single-entry interference basis, for the\nminimum allowable spacing between two satellites as a function of electrical\nparameters and service-area geometries. For circular beams, universal curves\nrelate the topocentric satellite spacing angle to the service-area separation\nangle measured at the satellite. The corresponding geocentric spacing depends\nonly weakly on the mean longitude of the two satellites, and this is true also\nfor elliptical antenna beams.\nAs a consequence, if frequency channels are preassigned, the orbital\nassignment synthesis of a satellite system can be formulated as a mixed-integer\nprogramming (MIP) problem or approximated by a linear programming (LP) problem,\nwith the interference protection requirements enforced by constraints while some\nlinear function is optimized. Possible objective-function choices are discussed\nand explicit formulations are presented for the choice of the sum of the absolute\ndeviations of the orbital locations from some prescribed "ideal" location set.\nA test problem is posed consisting of six service areas, each served by one\nsatellite, all using elliptical antenna beams and the same frequency channels.\nNumerical results are given for three "ideal" location prescriptions for both the\nMIP and the LP formulations. The resulting scenarios also satisfy reasonable\naggregate interference protection requirements.\n17. Document Analysis\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.

Here we shall introduce an intermediate step:\n\nfrom an\n\nestimate of the required single-entry protection we shall first\ncalculate the required satellite separations and then use these as\nconstraints in a linear-programming optimization, which should require\nless computational effort.\n\nTo do so, it is first necessary to derive\n\nquantitative relationships between the required satellite separations,\nthe service-area geography, the protection ratios, and other system\nparameters.\n\nII. REQUIRED SATELLITE SEPARATIONS\nConsider the single-entry interference between two down-link\nsatellite communications circuits. The up-link calculation has been\nshown to be dual, i.e., of precisely the same form [6],\nshown in Figure .1. The following notation is used:\n\nThe geometry is\n\nS - satellite,\n\nE - earth station, W - wanted network, I - interfering network, T transmit, R - receive. These symbols will also be used as subscripts in\nthe equations below.\n\nIt should be noted that the angle 4\xc2\xbb, is a\n\n1\n\nEARTH\n\n(a) Overall geometry\n\nSW\n\nGROUND AIM\nPOINT OF SI\nGROUND AIM\nPOINT OF SW\n\nCOVERAGE AREA OF SW\n\xe2\x80\xa2WANTED SIGNAL PATHS\nINTERFERING SIGNAL PATHS\n\n(b) Detail with Earth radius exaggerated for clarity\nFigure 1.\n\nInterference geometry between down-link networks.\n\ntwo-dimensional vector since, for elliptical or shaped beams, not only\nits magnitude is important, but also the orientation of its plane with\nrespect to the plane defined by the beam axis and the beam-maximum (or\nother reference) direction, e.g., the ellipse major axis for elliptical\npatterns.\n\nSimilarly the angle ty* is\n\na\n\nvector, but ip., can be treated as\n\na scalar since there is no incentive for earth stations to use\nnon-circular beams.\nThe carrier and interference powers can be determined by means of\nthe Friis transmission formula [7] and combined to give a\nwell-approximated single-entry carrier-to-interference\n\nEWR\n\nratio\n\n" E SIT\n\nwhere E denotes effective isotropic radiated power, n antenna\ndiscrimination relative to the beam maximum, and G antenna gain in the\nbeam-maximum direction [8].\ncarrier-to-interference\n\nFor satisfactory performance the\n\nratio must equal or exceed the required\n\nprotection ratio, which is the product of a co-channel protection ratio\nP and a relative protection ratio p ( f ) , where f denotes the frequency\noffset from co-channel [9],\n\nTherefore Equation (1) shows that the\n\nminimum allowable satellite spacing is implied in\n\n\'\n\nD\n\nSIT<V GSIT>\n\nwhere R\n\nDN\n\n= P\n\nP(f> ESWT ESIT Dsl (V\n\nG\n\nSWT>\n\nThe first four factors in RON are known system parameters.\n\nAlso since\n\ncalculations will always be performed at test points on the boundary of\na service area and since, in practice, satellite beams will be shaped to\ngive a-- reduction of approximately 3 dB at these test points, one can set\n-\xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\xa2\nDSNT^I\'^SMT) a !/2\xc2\xab Tne left side of Equation (2) can therefore be\nconsidered known in an orbit synthesis procedure.\nIt is important to note that Equation (2) is an implicit equation\nrelating the required satellite separation to the separation of the two\nservice areas. The existence of such a relationship has long been\nrecognized qualitatively [10,11], Equations (2) and (3) state\nquantitatively that, when frequency isolation is insufficient, the\nsystem requires antenna discrimination to achieve a required protection\nlevel, and that this is obtained as the product of the earth and\nsatellite antenna discriminations.\n\nIII.\n\nSEPARATIONS FOR CIRCULAR BEAMS\n\nFor circular beams, the angle ^2 in Equation (2) becomes scalar and\nit is possible to solve explicitly for 1^3 as a function of i|>2 when the\ndiscrimination patterns DsiT> nEWR\n\nare\n\nspecified. The relationship can\n\nbe plotted conveniently as a universal set of contour curves, with R^\nas parameter and normalized values of ^.^\n\nas coordinates.\n\nThe need\n\nfor normalization is implied in Equation (2) by the presence of the\n\ngains G as arguments in the antenna discriminations.\n\nFor example, when\n\nGEWR is large, corresponding to a narrow Earth-station beam, a given\nvalue of DEHR is reached with a smaller value of ^3 than when GE^R is\nsmall.\n\nThe universal curves are shown in Figure 2 for discrimination\n\npattern envelopes recommended by the CCIR for co-polarized FSS\nantennas [12,13],\n\nUnfortunately, no corresponding cross-polarized\n\npatterns have been recommended as yet.\n\nTwo sets of curves are required\n\nbecause of the piecewise specifications of DC^).\n\nAt first sight it\n\nmight appear that four sets would be required since four "pieces" are\nused in the CCIR specification of Earth-station discrimination.\nHowever, it turns out that the far side-lobe and back-lobe regions imply\nso much discrimination that the interference can be neglected, while the\nconstant part of the pattern, representing the near-sidelobe envelope,\nis accounted for by the discontinuity in the ^3 values which results\nfrom switching between Figures 2a and 2b in accordance with the\ndirections given below them.\nThe expression of the universal curves in terms of the\nantenna-centered "off-axis" angles \\|>2 and t3 is natural and also useful:\nfor example, it shows that the "separation" of service areas, measured\nby i|>2\xc2\xbb is rigorously the distance from the aimpoint of the interfering\nsatellite antenna to that test point of the area suffering interference\nwhich is on the highest discrimination contour of the interfering\nsatellite antenna pattern on the Earth surface.\n\nFor circular beams and\n\nhigh satellite elevations this would be the test point nearest to the\ninterfering satellite aim point.\n\nNevertheless, for many system\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n0\n(a) Use for t- > 26.3 G^un 3 degrees or above appropriate\nEarth station antenna gain line.

SEPARATIONS FOR ELLIPTICAL BEAMS\n\nFor elliptical beams, the required satellite separations can be\ncalculated by the following procedure:\n(1) For each service area choose test points on the periphery and\ncalculate the orientation and axial ratio Ar of the minimum\nprojected ellipses which enclose them, using 2\xc2\xb0 increments in\nsatellite longitude [15],\n(2) Choose a wanted and an interfering satellite and a longitude\nwithin the orbital arc under consideration, and consider the\ndesired and interfering satellites collocated at that longitude.\nBy incrementally increasing A<{>, with the satellites located\nsymmetrically on each side of the initially chosen central\n\n10\n\nlongitude, calculate the required satellite separation from\nEquation (2) with\n\nwhere \\|\xc2\xbb0 is the half-power beamwidth in the direction of the major\naxis and 6 is the angle between the plane in which ^ is measured\nand the plane determined by the SIT beam axis and the SIT ellipse\nmajor axis.\n\nEquation (5) is used for evaluating ^ in this\n\ncalculation.\n(3) Repeat step (2) for other central longitudes.\n\nThe result for the\n\nworst test point for each service area shown in Figure 5 is shown\nin Table 1 for a sequence of central longitudes.\n\nFor each pair of\n\nsatellites two separation values can be obtained, depending on\nwhich service area is considered protected, with the satellite of\nthe other area considered interfering.\nappears as A<|> in Table 1.\n\nThe larger of these\n\nNotice the slow variation of A<|> with\n\nthe mean satellite longitude, provided that this longitude is not\ntoo different from that of the protected service area. One\nsatellite per service area was assumed in these calculations.\n(4) Choose the largest of all the A<J> values obtained in this process\nover the allowable orbital arc for each satellite pair and denote\nit AS.

Three\nfunctions have occurred to us:\n(a) to search only for some point in the feasible region by setting\nthe function to be minimized equal to zero;\n(b) to minimize the occupied orbital arc;\n(c) to minimize the sum of the absolute deviations of the satellite\nlocations from a specified set of locations.\n\n14\n\nThe last objective has been implemented in the formulation described\nbelow. The following parameters and non-negative variables are used:\nej(wj) - easternmost (westernmost) feasible location for satellite\nj, in \xc2\xb0W,\n\ndj - desired location for satellite j,\nAS-JJ - required minimum separation between satellites i and j, as\nin Table 2,\nXj - relative location (in degrees west of ej) of satellite j,\nXj+(xj~) - degrees west (east) of dj that satellite j is located,\np\n\nij(nij) - degrees west (east) of satellite j that satellite i is\nlocated (defined for i < j).\nThe FSS orbit assignment synthesis is then formulated as follows:\n\nMinimize\n\nz = I (Xj+ + xj-)\n\n(8)\n\nJ\n\nsubject to\nXj - Xj+ + Xj- = dj\n\nfor all j ,\n\n(9)\n\nx-j - Xj - p-jj + n-jj = 0 for all i,j\n\nwhere i < j ,\nPij + njj > ASfj\n\n(10)\n\nfor all i,j\nwhere i < j ,\n15\n\n(11)\n\nXj < Wj - ej\n\nfor all j ,\n\n(12)\n\nXj, xj+,\n\nfor all j ,\n\n(13)\n\nPlj\xc2\xbb\n\nn\n\nXj- > 0\n\nij > \xc2\xb0\n\nfor all i,j\nwhere i < j ,\n\n(14)\n\nand\n\nwhere i < j .\n\n(15)\n\nThe objective function, Equation (8), computes the sum of the\nabsolute deviations of the prescribed satellite locations Uj\'s) from\nthe desired or ideal locations (dj\'s). These absolute deviations are\nmeasured in the first set of constraints, Equation (9). The actual\nseparations between all pairs of satellites (p^j + n-jj) are computed in\nthe second set of constraints, Equation (10), and are compared to the\nminimum required satellite separations in the third set of constraints,\nEquation (11). The constraints of Equation (12) guarantee that the\nlocation prescribed for each satellite is feasible. Constraint Equations\n(13) and (14) indicate that all of the variables in the problem are\nrestricted to non-negative values. Finally the complementary\nrelationships between pairs of variables p^j and n^j are enforced by the\nconstraints of Equation (15).\nLinear programs are much more readily solvable than nonlinear\nprograms and integer programs. They are most often solved by the simplex\nmethod [19],\n\nThis technique examines a sequence of basic solutions to\n\nthe constraints of the linear program. Each solution examined has an\n16\n\nobjective function value no less favorable than that of the previous\nsolution. The algorithm terminates when it is determined that no\nimproved solution can be found.\nThe presence of the nonlinear side constraints of Equation (15)\nprevents us from using the simplex method in its most common form. The\nmethod can be modified to handle these additional constraints through the\nuse of restricted basis entry: p-jj can not be a basic variable if njj is\na basic variable, and vice versa [20],\n\nWhen employing the simplex method\n\nwith restricted basis entry, we are certain to find a local, but not\nnecessarily a global, optimum. As formulated, the problem has m(m+2)\nvariables, where m is the number of satellites, and m2 constraints, not\ncounting the simple bound constraints of Equations (12) to (14) and\ncomplementarity constraints of Equation (15).\n\nThe formulation is similar\n\nto one suggested by Ignizio for the N-job, single-machine scheduling\nproblem\n\n[21],\n\nVI. MIXED INTEGER PROGRAMMING FORMULATION\n\nThe same problem can also be formulated as a mixed integer program\n[22],\n\nA global optimum is guaranteed when this formulation is employed.\n\nHowever, the computational effort required to find a final solution can\nbe immensely greater than it would be with the linear programming\nformulation.\n\nIn any case, this formulation is helpful in assessing the\n\nquality of the solutions found using the linear programming formulation\non small test problems.\n\n17\n\nTo complete this formulation, we need the following definitions:\n\ne = mi.n {e.}\nJ\nJ\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nw = max {w.}\n,\nJ\nJ\n1 if satellite i is located west of\nx\n=\nsatellite j\nij\nf satellite j.\n0 otherwise .\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\nThe objective function and the constraints (9), (10), (11), (13) and\n(14) appear in this formulation precisely as they did in the linear\nprogramming formulation.\n\nThe complementarity constraints (15) are\n\nreplaced by two new constraints:\n\n< 0\n\n(15a)\n\n(w-e)x1j + ni . < (w-e)\n\n(15b)\n\nwhich, together with the nonnegativity restrictions on p^j and njj,\nconstraints (14), guarantee that either PJJ = 0 or n-jj = 0 for all pairs\nof satellites i and j.\nIf there are m satellites, the mixed integer formulation entails\nm(m+2) continuous variables, m(m+l)/2 binary variables, and 2m2-m\nconstraints specified by Equations (9), (10), (11), (15a), (15b). The\ntime required to solve an FSS synthesis problem with this formulation\nwill be most heavily dependent upon the number of binary variables. For\nlarge problems (many satellites), this formulation may involve\nprohibitive solution times.\n\n18\n\nVII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nThe FSS synthesis minimizing the sum of absolute deviations of\norbital positions from a prescribed "desired" set was solved, both as a\nlinear program with the simplex method with restricted basis entry and\nas a mixed integer program via branch-and-bound [23].\n\nThe service areas\n\nand test points were those of Figure 5 with one satellite per service\narea.\n\nThe available orbital arc for each satellite was specified as\n\n80\xc2\xb0W to 110\xc2\xb0W.\n\nIt was assumed that each satellite would carry a full\n\ncomplement of frequency channels, so that a co-channel calculation is\nappropriate.\n\nA single-entry C/I value of 30 dB was chosen with the\n\nintent of achieving a 25 dB aggregate co-channel C/I ratio.\nassumptions the As values of Table 2 are pertinent.\n\nWith these\n\nThree problems were\n\nrun, differing only in the specified "desired" satellite locations.\n\nIn\n\nproblem 1, this "desired" location was specified for every satellite as\n95\xc2\xb0W, the center of the arc.\n\nIn problem 2, all\n\n"desired" locations were\n\nspecified at 110\xc2\xb0W, the westernmost end of the arc.\n\nIn problem 3, each\n\nwas specified near the central longitude of the ellipse circumscribing\nthe service area to be served; these "desired" longitudes are indicated\nin the column labeled DL in Table 3, which shows the solutions obtained\nfor all\n\nthree problems by both methods.\n\nThe LP formulations required 48\n\nvariables and 36 constraints, while 63 variables, 15 of them binary, and\n66 constraints were needed for the MIP formulation.\nThe solutions to these test problems illustrate some important\npoints.\n\nFirst of all,\n\nthe solution of a synthesis problem by means of\n\nan integer program can require a substantially greater amount of\n\n19\no\n\n5?\n\nro\nE\n\xe2\x80\x94\nn\n\nQ""*\n\no\nf\n\nVC\n\nCO\n\noo\n\nCNJ\n\nCO\n\nQ_\n\n\xc2\xabS-\n\nO\n\nCO\n\nr-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2<*\n\nCM\n\nI-H\n\nCD\n\nCXi\n\nCO\n\nC\nt\xe2\x80\x941\n\nvc\nCM\ni-H\no\n\nr*\xc2\xbb\ni^^\nr^\n01\n\nLO\nr^\noo\n\nr^vo\n^n\nCM CM\no\nco\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2-H\n\nir>\n\nvo\n\nC\nCM\n\nCO\n\nm\nCM\nen\n\nCM\nLT>\n\nCM\n\nCM\n\nCO\n\nin\n\nvc\n\nCO\n\nl-H\n\nCM\n\n^j.*\n\nO\n\nl-H\n\nl-H\n\nCM\n\nvo\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\nCM\n\nCO\n\nCO\n\nCO\nCM\n\nCM\n\nCO\n\nl-H\n\nl-H\n\nen\nto\n\n^>\n\nO\n\nCM\n\nCO\n\nCO\nCO\n\nCM\ni-H\n\n1\xe2\x80\x941\n\ncn\n\nCO\nCM\n\nl-H\n\nQ-\n\nir>\n\nun\n\nto\n\nin\n\nin\n\ntr>\n\nr^\n\nCM\n\nr-^ \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nr\xc2\xab~ \'\n\nCM\n\nCM\n\nCO\n\nQ\n\nCT>\n\nCT)\n\nCO\n\nO\n\nCO\n\nl-H\n\nIf}\n\n00\n\no\nex.\na.\nCO\n\n00\n\n5?\n\nc-o\n\nco\n,-H\n\n.-H\nr~-\n\nO\n\nO.\n\nCD\n\n^\n\nir>\ni\xc2\xab\n\n^"\n\nCO\n\nin\ni^\n\nvo\nen\n\nC\n\no\no\n\nO\n\nC\n\nO\n\nI-H\n\nf-H\n\nl-H\n\nl-H\n\nl-H\n\ni-H\n\n10\nr^\nen\nen\n\n^o\nr^\nr^\nen\n\nen\ntf>\nco\no\n\nen\n\nE\n\nO)\n\noo\nUJ\n\nCO\n\nJ3\nO\nt\nQ-\n\no\no\no\ni\xe2\x80\x94i\n\nco\nco\n*3~\no\n\nr\xe2\x80\x941\n\nr- 1\n\nO.\n\nCO\nVO\n\nf1^\n^^\n\nCD\nCD\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\nco\nco\n\nen\nen\n\n^\nr~-\n\nt^.\nm\n\nf\\\n_*_\n\n_J\n\noo\nz\no\n\nc\noo\nr\xe2\x80\x941\n\nvo\nco\nm\no\n\ni-H\n\ni\xe2\x80\x941\n\nCD\nCD\n\n^O\nCD\n\nCTi\nl^\n\nCM\n\ni"\nen\n\nco\nen\n\nI-H\nen\n\nvo\nen\n\nCO\n\no\no\n\no\no\n\nvo \xc2\xab*\xe2\x80\xa2\no 10\n\nl-H\n\nco CM\nen cr>\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'\n\n^~\n\nCO\n\no\n\nl-H\n\nIf)\nCM\n\nf-H\n\nE\nO\n0\n\nc_\n\nD- Ql\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nir>\no\n\n^H\no\n\nl-H\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nr^\nen\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ni\xc2\xab\nen\n\no\nCM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ni\xe2\x80\x941\nCO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nCO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\ni-H\n\ni-H\n\nCO\nCM\n\ni-H\n\nZJ\nQ\n.\nO\n\n1/}\nl\n\nz\n\n<\xe2\x80\xa2D\nt-H .\xe2\x80\xa2i\xe2\x80\x94 *^\nh\nS\n\xc2\xab\xe2\x80\x94 <>\n\xe2\x80\xa2I\n<J --\'\n(\xe2\x80\xa2D\n_l\n\nf\n\nO\n\na:\n\n*f.\n\n_l\n\n_l\n\nCO\n\nO\n\no\n\n:n\n\nCS\n\na;\n\nQ.\n\n=>\n\no;\n\nO-\n\nO\n\noi\n\nZ3\n\n>\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa24->\nU\nO)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2-}\n\n.O 3T3\n0 M-^--\n\n20\n\n.c\n\n~-~.\n\nCZ 10\nO <U\n\xe2\x80\xa2!\xe2\x80\x94 <D\n4-> 1.\nU C7>\nC O)\n\nU) I/)\n!\xe2\x80\x94\n\nC\n\n01\n\nO\nO\n\nOl\n*\n\nE ******\n\nto 0) CD\n4-> \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94 t\xe2\x80\xa2iCT\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r- O\n\nJ3 U <V\n^_ &_ ^O\n^5 \'O ^\xc2\xab\xe2\x80\x94***\n\n~~v \xe2\x80\xa2*^-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa24-1)\n\nQJ\n\ntox\n\nO.\nO\n\nCO\n\no\nI\nco\n\nCO\n\ncomputer time than by means of a linear program.\n\nSecondly, the two\n\napproaches used can produce strikingly different solutions.\nresults for Problems 1 and 2.)\n\n(See the\n\nIt may also happen that the same\n\nsolution will be found with both methods, even though this is not\nevident from the results presented here.\n\nFinally, acceptable solutions,\n\nin terms of aggregate co-channel C/I ratios, are obtained even when the\nobjective function value for the linear programming solution differs\nsubstantially from the mixed integer programming solution, the global\noptimum.\n\nThis is not unexpected because the AS constraints guarantee\n\nacceptable single-entry C/I ratios.\n\nTable 4 shows the distributions of\n\naggregate co-channel C/I ratios for the two methods and three problems.\nIt will be remembered that a 30 dB single-entry constraint was used to\ncalculate the As table on which all these calculations are based.\n\nTABLE 4\nNUMBER OF TEST POINTS CORRESPONDING\nTO A GIVEN AGGREGATE CO-CHANNEL\nC/I RATIO RANGE FOR EACH PROBLEM AND METHOD\n\nProblem\n\nMethod\n\n<27\n\nC/I Interval (dB)\n27-28 28-30 30-35\n\n>35\n\n1\n\nLP\n\n0\n\n1\n\n8\n\n16\n\n29\n\n1\n\nMIP\n\n0\n\n1\n\n6\n\n18\n\n29\n\n2\n\nLP\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n20\n\n29\n\n2\n\nMIP\n\n0\n\n4\n\n10\n\n25\n\n15\n\n3\n\nLP\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n16\n\n34\n\n3\n\nMIP\n\n0\n\n0\n\n9\n\n14\n\n31\n\n21\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAn i m p l i c i t relationship has been derived which relates the\ntopocentric separation of two satellites as required for a given level\nof single-entry protection to the separation and orientation of their\nservice areas. For circular beams and topocentric angles the results\nare presented explicitly; a computational approach is given for\nelliptical beams and for use with longitude and latitude variables.\n\nIt\n\nis found that the geocentric separation depends primarily on the service\narea separation, secondly on a parameter RQN which characterizes the\nelectrical design, and only slightly on the mean orbital position of the\nsatellites. Both linear programming (LP) and mixed integer programming\n(MIP) algorithms have been implemented, with the sum of the absolute\ndeviations of the orbital locations from a prescribed "ideal" set as\nobjective function. Three "ideal" sets were used. A single-entry\nprotection ratio of 30 dB was specified with the intent of satisfying an\naggregate co-channel C/I ratio of 25 dB. The set of orbital locations\nchosen by the LP and MIP methods differed substantially in two cases\nand, to a lesser degree, in the third. S t i l l , all six solutions which\nwere found provided acceptable protection ratios at all 54 test points.\nThe worst aggregate co-channel C/I ratio found was 27 dB.\nThe results are encouraging with respect to applying the LP\nprocedure to larger scenarios.\n\nThe MIP formulation may result in\n\nexcessive computation times when many satellites are involved, but it is\nguaranteed to arrive at a global optimum; it w i l l therefore be useful\nfor evaluating the efficacy of the LP approach via smaller test\nproblems, such as the three presented here.\n22\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1]\n\nY.
