Traditionally chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have been used in the precision cleaning of LOX systems, specifically CFC 113 (C2Cl3F3). CFCs have been known to cause the depletion of ozone and in 1987, were banned by the Montreal Protocol due to health, safety and environmental concerns. This has now led to the development of new processes in the precision cleaning of aerospace components. An ideal solvent-replacement is non-flammable, environmentally benign, non-corrosive, inexpensive, effective and evaporates completely, leaving no residue. Highlighted is a green precision cleaning process, which is contaminant removal using supercritical carbon dioxide as the environmentally benign solvent. In this process, the contaminant is dissolved in carbon dioxide, and the parts are recovered at the end of the cleaning process completely dry and ready for use. Typical contaminants of aerospace components include hydrocarbon greases, hydraulic fluids, silicone fluids and greases, fluorocarbon fluids and greases and fingerprint oil. Metallic aerospace components range from small nuts and bolts to much larger parts, such as butterfly valves 18 in diameter. A fluorinated grease, Krytox, is investigated as a model contaminant in these preliminary studies, and aluminum coupons are employed as a model aerospace component. Preliminary studies are presented in which the experimental parameters are optimized for removal of Krytox from aluminum coupons in a stirred-batch process. The experimental conditions investigated are temperature, pressure, exposure time and impeller speed. Temperatures of 308 - 423 K, pressures in the range of 8.3 - 41.4 MPa, exposure times between 5 - 60 min and impeller speeds of 0 - 1000 rpm were investigated. Preliminary results showed up to 86 cleaning efficiency with the moderate processing conditions of 323 K, 13.8 MPa, 30 min and 750 rpm.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Brazil", "submissionId": 20140010719, "endDate": "2013-12-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Universidade Estadual de Campinas", "location": "Brazil"}}, "meetingId": "657df01abf36424ab3164114c88ce930", "id": "98315b7dc5e14ee2a58b433bbfc4be36"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Science Foundation", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "657df01abf36424ab3164114c88ce930", "id": "ad073d99397d4583b74b065d01e9737e"}], "name": "Workshop on Supercritical Fluids and Energy", "location": "Campinas, Brasil", "id": "657df01abf36424ab3164114c88ce930", "startDate": "2013-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140010719, "id": "89ab38375ef74e79bbc7bbf85db26b15", "publicationDate": "2013-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140010719.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140010719/downloads/20140010719.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140010719/downloads/20140010719.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140010719/downloads/20140010719.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
