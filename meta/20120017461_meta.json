Key components include the ability to effectively move relevant information through a large community, process patterns that support model reuse and the identification of the necessary meta-information (ex. history, credibility, and provenance) to safely use and re-use that information. In order to successfully Use and Re-Use Models and Simulations we must define and meet key organizational and structural needs: 1. We must understand and acknowledge all the roles and players involved from the initial need identification through to the final product, as well as how they change across the lifecycle. 2. We must create the necessary structural elements to store and share NIMA-enabled information throughout the Program or Project lifecycle. 3. We must create the necessary organizational processes to stand up and execute a NIMA-enabled Program or Project throughout its lifecycle. NASA must meet all three of these needs to successfully use and re-use models. The ability to Reuse Models a key component of NIMA and the capabilities inherent in NIMA are key to accomplishing NASA's space exploration goals. 11", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120017461, "id": "effb39497abc4dc288414f1e9a4e3c70", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120017461.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120017461/downloads/20120017461.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120017461/downloads/20120017461.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120017461/downloads/20120017461.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
