The passwe vehicle is nontranslating\nand should provide\nfor maintenance\nof the desired\napproach\nattitude.\nIt must\naccommodate\nthe active\n(translating)\nvehicle\ninduced\nstructural\nloads and performance\ncharacteristics\n(mating hardware tolerances),\nand support sensor compatibility\n(transponder, visual\ntargets, etc). The active vehicle must provide adequate sensor systems (relative state information,\nfield-of-view,\nredundancy),\nflight control hardware\n(thruster sizing, minimal\ncross-coupling,\nperformance\nmargins,\nredundancy)\nand soft-ware (reconfigurable,\nattitude/rate modes, translation\nand rotation f\'me control authority) characteristics,\nand adequate non-propulsive\nconsumables\nsuch\nas power.\nOperational\nconcerns must be considered.\nThese include: (1) the desired approach\ntrajectory and relative orientation;\n(2) the active vehicle thruster\nplume effects\ncontamination)\non the passive vehicle;\nand (3) procedures\nfor contingencies\ncommunications,\nsensor or propulsion failures, and target vehicle loss of control.\n\n(forces, torques,\nO 7._\ni\nsuch as loss of\n,,5",_2 -- 1 _\'\nI? ,,,_..r..di.v\n\nGuideline\n\nRequirements\nInterfaces\n\nfor Serviceable\nSpacecraft\nGrasping/Berthing/Docking\nBased\non Simulations\nand Flight\nExperience\nby A.

It includes telemetry,\nguidance and navigation,\ncontrol electronics,\nthrust vector control, and redundancy\nlevels.\nThe new INU combines the inertial measurement\nsystem with the flight control system into a single\nradiation hardened package including\nring laser gyros, accelerometers,\nprocessors,\nand electronics.\nThis new system resulted in a weight savings of over 100 pounds and a four-to-one\ncost reduction.\nThe new Remote\nVoter Unit (RVU) receives\ncommands\nand performs\na 2 out of 3 vote on the\ndiscrete\ncommands\nwith a center select on the analog\nsignals.\nThe RVU is fully internally\nredundant,\nhas been developed,\nbreadboarded,\nand demonstrated.\nThe integration\nof a Global\nPositioning\nSystem receiver into the inertial navigation\nsystem has been accomplished\nfor _th the\nadvanced\nCentaur\nand the cruise missile programs.\nThe capability\nprovidedby\nthis system will\nmeet the accuracy\nrequirements\nfor low earth operations\nindependent\nof mission duration\ntime.
