Gilkey and Sandra L. Olson\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nGlenn Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\n\n1.0\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.1\n\nPurpose of the Technology Development\n\nAn oxygen concentrator is needed to provide enriched oxygen in support of medical contingency\noperations for future exploration human spaceflight programs [Watkins]. It would provide continuous\noxygen to an ill or injured crew member in a closed cabin environment. Oxygen concentration technology\nis being pursued to concentrate oxygen from the ambient environment so oxygen as a consumable\nresource can be reduced. Because oxygen is a critical resource in manned spaceflight, using an oxygen\nconcentrator to pull oxygen out of the ambient environment instead of using compressed oxygen can\nprovide better optimization of resources. The overall goal of this project is to develop an oxygen\nconcentrator module that minimizes the hardware mass, volume, and power footprint while still\nperforming at the required clinical capabilities.\nShould a medical event occur that requires patient oxygenation, the release of 100 percent oxygen into a\nsmall closed cabin environment can rapidly raise oxygen levels to the vehicles fire limit. The use of an\noxygen concentrator to enrich oxygen from the ambient air and concentrate it to the point where it can be\nused for medical purposes means no oxygen is needed from the ultra-high purity (99.5+% O2) oxygen\nreserve tanks. By not adding oxygen from compressed tanks to the cabin environment, oxygen levels can be\nkept below the vehicle fire limit thereby extending the duration of care provided to an oxygenated patient\nwithout environmental control system intervention to keep the cabin oxygen levels below the fire limits.\nThe oxygen concentrator will be a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearable device. A\ndemonstration unit for the International Space Station (ISS) is planned to verify the technology and\nprovide oxygen capability. For the ISS, the demonstration unit should not exceed 10 kg (approximately\n22 lb), which is the soft stowage mass limit for launch on resupply vehicles for the ISS. The unit\xe2\x80\x99s size\nshould allow for transport within the spacecraft to an ill crewmember. The user interface needs to be\ndesigned for ease of use by the local care provider and with consideration to the limited amount of\ntraining available to the astronaut corps for medical equipment and procedures.\n\n1.2\n\nEvaluation Criteria\n\nThis section lists the draft requirements for an oxygen concentrator for exploration missions. They\nwill be referenced by number in the prototype test results evaluation. There are five main categories of\nrequirements: atmosphere (oxygen and pressure), flow, timing, power, and other miscellaneous\nrequirements. The first three have some quantitative requirements for which the prototypes can be directly\nevaluated. Other requirements were beyond the scope or technology readiness level (TRL) of the\nprototypes, and are included here for completeness.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n1\n\n1.2.1\n1.2.1.1\n\nAtmosphere (Oxygen and Pressure) Requirements\nThe OCM shall be capable of generating an oxygen concentration output of at least\n50 percent oxygen on a minute average basis.\nRationale: This is the minimum oxygen concentration output coupled with the minimum flow\nrate described in requirement 1.2.2.2 needed to maintain the oxygen saturation of a\ncrewmember during a medical contingency based on treatment protocols [Watkins].\n\n1.2.1.2\n\nThe OCM shall be capable of generating an oxygen concentration output of over 90 percent\noxygen on a minute average basis for critical cases.\nRationale: Nearly pure oxygen concentration will allow for increased care should the patient\nrequire more oxygen at the cost of increased power usage.\n\n1.2.1.3\n\nThe OCM shall operate without increasing the overall partial pressure of oxygen in a closed\ncabin.\nRationale: Ensures that the medical oxygen needs can be supported for extended periods of\ntime without exceeding the fire limit for cabin oxygen concentration. The OCM in and of\nitself will not be a source of oxygen. Its input and output oxygen mass balance should be a net\nof zero.\n\n1.2.1.4\n\nThe OCM shall provide an output pressure of 55 to 60 psia regulated as needed as part of the\ndelivery system.\nRationale: Provide at least some positive pressure when oxygen is being supplied to a patient\nusing a mask. The system must maintain a pressure safe for patients and other medical\nequipment downstream of the output flow.\n\n1.2.1.5\n\nThe OCM shall operate using ambient cabin air as the input gas supply.\nRationale: The system needs to meet the specified performance requirements without access\nto high pressure or preconditioned gases.\n\n1.2.1.6\n\nThe OCM shall operate in the exploration ambient environments with the following\ncharacteristics [CxP 70024, Campbell, Conkin, Gerstenmaier]:\nA. Atmospheric temperature within the range of 18 \xef\x82\xb0C (64.4 \xef\x82\xb0F) to 27 \xef\x82\xb0C (80.6 \xef\x82\xb0F).\nB. Average relative humidity level over each 24-hour period between 25 and 75 percent.\nC. Average oxygen concentration of 21, 26.5, or 34 percent O2 by volume, depending on\ntotal pressure.\nD. Internal pressure to operate within 7.5 and 15.0 psia.\nE. Partial pressure of oxygen in the internal atmosphere to operate within 2.69 and 3.44 psia.\nF. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the internal atmosphere to less than 0.100 psia\naverage over any 1-hr time frame.\n\n1.2.2\n1.2.2.1\n\nFlow Requirements\nThe OCM shall have a maximum output flow rate of at least 6 liters per minute.\nRationale: This is the maximum output flow rate coupled with the maximum oxygen\nconcentration output described in requirement 1.2.1.2 needed to maintain the oxygen\nsaturation of a crewmember during a medical contingency based on treatment protocols\n[Watkins].\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n2\n\n1.2.2.2\n\nThe OCM shall have a minimum output flow rate of 2 liters per minute.\nRationale: This is the minimum output flow rate coupled with the minimum oxygen\nconcentration output described in requirement 1.2.1.1 needed to maintain the oxygen\nsaturation of a crewmember during a medical contingency based on treatment protocols\n[Watkins].\n\n1.2.2.3\n\nThe OCM shall be able to provide on-demand oxygen flow to reduce power consumption for\nless critical cases.\nRationale: Any on-demand flow system senses the inhalation of the patient using a nasal\ncannula, and only provides flow during the actual inhalation. This decreases the duty cycle\nand reduces the power consumption of the unit.\n\n1.2.3\n1.2.3.1\n\nOperational Time Requirements\nThe OCM shall operate within performance requirements within 2 min of startup. An\nindicator on the unit should indicate when it is operating at the set flow rate. \xe2\x80\x9cPerformance\nrequirements\xe2\x80\x9d are defined as the production of oxygen at the desired concentration and flow\nrate.\nRationale: Limits the amount of time after startup that patient oxygen saturation would have\nto be maintained using cabin air or an alternative oxygen supply.\n\n1.2.3.2\n\nThe OCM shall operate within performance requirements after up to two years without\nsignificant maintenance required.\nRationale: Ensures the device shelf life supports the nature of the exploration mission and\nother space flight programs.\n\n1.2.3.3\n\nThe OCM shall be able to support more than one non-concurrent medical contingency event\nwithin its certified operational life.\nRationale: The intent of this requirement is for the OCM to not be a single use device. The\ndevice can be used multiple times for non-concurrent medical events.\n\n1.2.3.4\n\nThe OCM shall be capable of operating continuously for a minimum of 168 hr.\nRationale: This requirement stems from a potential medical contingency return from the\nlunar surface to recovery on Earth that has potential duration of seven days.\n\n1.2.4\n1.2.4.1\n\nPower Requirements\nThe OCM shall support input power from 28 to 120 VDC.\nRationale: The system needs to support power input from various aircraft and spacecraft\nalong the chain of care during a medical contingency. ISS currently uses 120 VDC, and the\nConstellation Orion vehicle is being designed to use 120 VDC. However, terrestrial transport\naircraft typically use 28 VDC. Therefore, to maintain continuity of care, the OCM will need\nto support this range of power source voltages.\n\n1.2.4.2\n\nThe OCM shall operate without exceeding a power draw of 360 W.\nRationale: The system needs to use external power supplies without exceeding the capacity of\nthe host vehicles for power and subsequent heat rejection.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n3\n\n1.2.4.3\n\nThe OCM shall operate on internal battery power for at least 8 hr.\nRationale: The system needs to be able to continuously supply oxygen to the patient while\nbeing transferred from once host vehicle to another. Furthermore, following return to Earth,\nrecovery by the recovery team could take up to 8 hr.\n\n1.2.4.4\n\nThe OCM shall be able to switch between external and internal power while continuing to\noperate.\nRationale: The system needs to be able to continuously supply oxygen to the patient while\nbeing transferred from once host vehicle to another.\n\n1.2.5\n1.2.5.1\n\nMiscellaneous Requirements\nThe OCM shall be portable between vehicles.\nRationale: The system needs to be easily removed from its primary use location and\ntransported with the patient while being transferred from one vehicle to another.\n\n1.2.5.2\n\nThe OCM shall provide removable inlet filters to filter smoke from a fire or fumes from a\ntoxic spill, so the ambient cabin air is clean as it enters the device.\nRationale: The system needs to meet the specified performance requirements in emergency\nsituations where the breathable atmosphere is contaminated.\n\n1.2.5.3\n\nThe OCM shall provide closed loop oxygen ventilation capability for smoke inhalation and\nother medical conditions requiring oxygen.\nRationale: Automated oxygen ventilation control and monitoring is needed to allow\ncrewmembers to focus on other patient care. The closed loop system needs to include a COoximeter for smoke inhalation as well as the normal pulse oximeter for oxygen saturation.\n\n1.2.5.4\n\nExternal monitoring and control capability with system parameters accessible in electronic\nform.\nRationale: Remote access to control and monitor system performance is needed to support\ncomputer control for remote care providers. The parameters should include power\nconsumption, battery life and status, and the concentration and flow rate of the oxygen\noutput, among others.\n\n1.2.5.5\n\nThe OCM shall conform to military airworthiness requirements in MIL-HDBK-516B.\nRationale: In the event of a medical contingency during space flight, transport of the ill or\ninjured crew member may require transfer to a definitive care facility via military aircraft.\n\n1.2.5.6\n\nThe OCM shall conform to space flight certification requirements (SSP 41172 Revision AB).\nRationale: The OCM needs to be able to be certified for flight on the ISS and the associated\ntransfer vehicles.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n4\n\n2.0\n\nExperimental Setup\n\nThe Spacecraft Exploration Atmospheres Test Lab at NASA Glenn Research Center (Bldg. 77- Rm.\n151) was used for the evaluation of the oxygen concentrator prototypes. The area of the lab used for the\ntesting is shown in Figure 1, and includes the test chamber, a vacuum exhaust system, a gas supply rack,\nchiller, power supplies, and data acquisition system.\n\n2.1\n\nLab Equipment\n\nThe test chamber is a 24- by 24- by 24- in. vacuum chamber with a cold plate at the floor level.\nMultiple flow and electrical feed-throughs provide access for the testing.\nA chiller is used to provide temperature-conditioned water to the cold plate in the bottom of the\nchamber. This is used primarily for heat rejection to maintain the chamber temperature at near-ambient\nconditions. Saturated salts are used to control the initial humidity in the chamber.\nThe vacuum system is used to evacuate the chamber so it can be filled with the desired gas mixture. If\nthe concentrator cannot withstand a hard vacuum, the chamber is partially evacuated and filled with the\ndesired gas mixture repeatedly to obtain the desired ambient oxygen concentration and total pressure.\nThe chamber is filled from the gas supply rack, which contains different O2-N2 blends of 21 percent\nO2, 30 percent O2, and 34 percent O2. In addition, a combustion products \xe2\x80\x9cdirty air\xe2\x80\x9d blend is present that\ncontains 20 percent O2, 1 percent CO2 and 55 ppm of CO. Additional bottles of 95 percent O2 and 100\npercent N2 are used to calibrate and purge the oxygen sensor before and after each test, respectively.\n\nTest chamber\nGas supply rack\nVacuum\nexhaust\nsystem\n\nPower\nsupplies\nData system\nChiller\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94The Spacecraft Exploration Atmospheres Test Lab at NASA Glenn Research Center.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n5\n\nFigure 2.\xe2\x80\x94Test apparatus concept.\n\nA concept for the oxygen concentrator prototype evaluation test setup is shown in Figure 2. The\noxygen concentrator is placed in the test chamber, draws in ambient atmosphere from the chamber, and\nseparates the gases to a waste stream that is predominantly nitrogen, and a product stream which is\npredominantly oxygen. Each of the three flow streams is measured for pressure, flow rate, temperature,\nhumidity, and the oxygen concentration of the product stream is also measured.\nIn addition, the voltage and current draw of the prototype was measured, and CO and CO2 sensors\nwere used in some tests that used a gas mixture with these contaminants present.\nA full description of the flow systems, electrical systems, and sensors used can be found in\nAppendix A.\n\n2.2\n\nTest Procedure\n\nPrior to each test, the prototype was prepared for the test. This included filling the liquid reservoir\nwith deionized water for the electrochemical prototype, and checking the touchpad flow setting (liters per\nminute or lpm) for the PSA prototype. The electrochemical prototype had external software control, so\nthe software was started and Ethernet connectivity was verified.\nSaturated salts were installed in the chamber to control the initial humidity level in the chamber, if\ndesired for the test point. The chamber was then sealed, and filled with the desired gas mixture at the\ndesired pressure. The chiller was activated to control the cold plate temperature. The data system and\npower supplies were turned on and allowed to warm up for at least 1 hr prior to the start of the test.\nThe oxygen sensor was calibrated prior to each test point using a premixed supply of 95 percent O2 in\nN2 and then purged with 100 percent N2 gas to provide an initial low oxygen reading so that the start of\noxygen production could be detected accurately. Appendix B has the calibration for the pressure\ncorrection factor for the oxygen sensor, since the oxygen sensor is sensitive to the ambient pressure in the\nchamber.\nThe data system was set up to record data at 1 Hz for the desired test time. The data collection was\nstarted, and then the power was turned on to the prototype so that that the time from activation to oxygen\nproduction could be evaluated. To end a test, the prototype was powered down prior to data collection\ntermination, to capture the power-down profile and timing.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n6\n\nAfter data collection was complete, the chamber was either evacuated to the fume hood or vented to\natmosphere, depending on the gas being used. At the end of data collection for the day, the O2 sensor was\nagain flushed with 100 percent N2 gas to prolong the electrochemical sensor life. The data was\ndownloaded for analysis. The chiller was turned off, power systems and data systems powered down, and\ngas bottles resealed with regulators depressurized.\n\n3.0\n\nPressure Swing Adsorption Prototype Evaluation\n\n3.1\n\nPSA Prototype Description\n\nThe National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) prototype was developed under a 4 year\ngrant, utilizing pressure swing adsorption technology (PSA) [Ritter, Bhadra, Ebner, Giesy, Lucas,\nMehotra, Wang]. Pressure swing adsorption technology separates oxygen from the air using packed beds\nof zeolite sorbent that preferentially passes oxygen while adsorbing the nitrogen in the zeolite pores under\nelevated pressures. The prototype, built by Chart Industries, a partner in the NSBRI grant, was delivered\nto NASA Glenn Research Center in late 2013. The prototype is shown in Figure 3, installed in the test\nchamber.\nThe prototype measured approximately 14 in. long by 12 in. wide by 8 in. tall, and weighed less than\n18 lb. The primary component of the system was a commercially available SeQual packed bed system, as\nshown in Figure 4.\nTesting was performed under a range of varying chamber conditions including oxygen level, pressure\n(along the normoxic curve), temperature and relative humidity. Normoxic equivalent environments were\nchosen because oxygen transport across the alveoli in human lungs is dependent primarily on the partial\npressure of O2, preventing hypoxia. The flow rate of the prototype was varied during testing to\ndemonstrate a variety of operational conditions. A premixed bottle with atmospheric contaminants was\nused to simulate the atmospheric conditions of smoke. This \xe2\x80\x9cdirty air\xe2\x80\x9d consisted of 20 percent O2,\n79 percent N2, 1 percent CO2 and 55 ppm CO.\n\nFigure 3.\xe2\x80\x94Photograph of PSA prototype oxygen concentrator\ninstalled in the test chamber.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n7\n\nFigure 4.\xe2\x80\x94Top left image shows packed bed module from SeQual,\nand bottom left image shows same packed bed (right) next to the\ncompressor (left). Both sit on a bed of foam to provide vibration\nand noise dampening. Shown on the lower right is the exposed\ntop circuitry and a display of the flow rate. The image on the top\nright shows the touchpad control on the prototype that toggled\nbetween off, 6, 3, 2, and 1 lpm.\n\nTABLE 1.\xe2\x80\x94SUMMARY OF ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHAMBER.\nFlow rate,\nOxygen level,\nTemperature,\nPressure,\nRelative humidity,\nlpm\npercent\npsia\npercent\n\xef\x82\xb0C\n1\n21\n20\n8.2\n37\n2\n30\n28\n10.2\n78\n3\n34\n14.7\n83\n6\nDirty air\nAtmospheric air\n\nDuring all test conditions, the power consumption of the prototype was recorded, capturing device\npower profiles during plug-in, start-up (power on), steady-state operation, shutdown (power off) and\nunplugging the device. Data collected during the evaluation includes start-up time, power profile,\nshutdown time, steady-state outlet oxygen concentration, flow rate, relative humidity, temperature,\npressure, O2, CO, and CO2 level.\nTable 1 outlines the atmospheres tested for this prototype, including oxygen level, pressure, relative\nhumidity and temperature. These atmospheres were selected to capture a variety of environmental\nconditions, from best case to worst case (see Appendix C for psychometric chart).\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n8\n\nThe chamber was completely sealed during testing and was instrumented to capture a plethora of\nperformance characteristics of the oxygen concentrator prototype. These data included pressure (chamber\npressure, pressure out and O2 pressure), humidity (chamber relative humidity, relative humidity out, O2\nrelative humidity), temperature (chamber temperature, prototype touch temperature, O2 temperature,\ntemperature out and plate temperature), flow rate (flow rate in, flow rate out, and O2 flow rate), voltage\n(system, prototype voltage and reference voltage), current draw, O2 concentration levels, CO\nconcentration levels, and CO2 concentration levels. The plate temperature refers to a cold plate located at\nthe floor of the chamber upon which the oxygen concentrator prototype sat. A photograph of the PSA\nprototype oxygen concentrator is shown in Figure 5.\nThe environmental chamber was completely sealed with the oxygen concentrator outlet going through\nthe external oxygen sensor and then back into the chamber, so all air remained in the chamber. For each\ntest point the power supplies, external data acquisition system and chiller were allowed to warm up for at\nleast 1 hr prior to data collection. The oxygen sensor was calibrated prior to each test point using\n95 percent O2 and then purged with 100 percent N2 gas so the initial level of oxygen was lowered. This\nwas done to detect when the prototype started enriching the ambient oxygen in the environmental\nchamber. After calibration, a hard vacuum was pulled on the chamber (down to 0.5 Torr) to pull residual\nair and calibration gas out of the lines and chamber and then the chamber was filled with the appropriate\ngas. After 5 to 10 min, data collection was started, followed by plugging in and turning on the oxygen\nconcentrator prototype to record the start-up power profile and timing. Data was then collected for 60 to\n90 min followed by the power-down sequence (turning off and unplugging the prototype) prior to data\ncollection ending, to capture the power-down profile and timing. After data collection was complete, the\nchamber was either evacuated to the fume hood or vented to atmosphere, depending on the gas being\nused. At the end of data collection for the day, the O2 sensor was flushed with 100 percent N2 gas and\nsealed to prolong sensor life.\n\nFigure 5.\xe2\x80\x94Photograph of the environmental test chamber with the PSA\nprototype installed.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n9\n\n3.2\n\nPSA System Performance Relative to Requirements\n\n3.2.1\n\nAtmosphere (Oxygen and Pressure) Requirements\n\nThe PSA prototype was designed to provide variable levels of oxygen at four discrete flow rates:\n1, 2, 3, or 6 lpm.\nAs indicated in Figure 6 the prototype generates about 45 percent oxygen at 6 lpm, 75 percent oxygen\nat 3 lpm, 85 percent oxygen at 2 lpm and approximately 90 percent oxygen at a flow rate of 1 lpm under\nthese chamber conditions. This fulfills requirements 1.2.1.1 and 1.2.1.2. This also demonstrates the\nprototype meets requirement 1.2.1.5.\nThe prototype meets requirement 1.2.1.3 as demonstrated by the nearly constant pressure within the\nenvironmental chamber during operation (see Figure 7).\n\nFigure 6.\xe2\x80\x94Oxygen concentration at varying flow rates.\n\nFigure 7.\xe2\x80\x94Partial pressure of oxygen in a closed environment.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n10\n\nO2 Pressure\xc2\xa0(14.7\xc2\xa0psia,\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0oC,\xc2\xa021%\xc2\xa0O2 Ambient)\n15.4\n\nPressure,\xc2\xa0psia\n\n15.2\n15\n14.8\n14.6\n1\xc2\xa0lpm\n2\xc2\xa0lpm\n3\xc2\xa0lpm\n6\xc2\xa0lpm\n\n14.4\n14.2\n14\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nTime,\xc2\xa0minutes\nFigure 8.\xe2\x80\x94Pressure of oxygen at varying flow rates.\n\nThe prototype was not tested against requirement 1.2.1.4. The pressure of the oxygen flowing directly\nback into the chamber is just slightly above ambient pressure (reference Figure 8).\nThe prototype was demonstrated in a variety of exploration ambient environments and therefore\npasses requirement 1.2.1.6. These data are shown in Figure 9 to Figure 14.\nA. Atmospheric temperature within the range of 18 to 27 \xef\x82\xb0C. The prototype meets this requirement\nand is able to provide 45 to 50 percent oxygen at 20 and 28 \xef\x82\xb0C (see Figure 9).\nB. Average relative humidity level over each 24-hr period between 25 to 75 percent, as shown in\nFigure 10. The prototype meets this requirement and is able to provide 45 to 50 percent oxygen at\n37 percent relative humidity and 78 percent relative humidity at 20 \xef\x82\xb0C and at 83 percent relative\nhumidity at 28 \xef\x82\xb0C. The PSA prototype meets this requirement and is able to provide oxygen at the\n6 lpm flow rate, however the prototype does not perform optimally at high humidity levels (78\nand 83 percent), as noted by the drop in flow rate of the N2 outlet after 20 to 30 min of operation),\npossibly due to condensation in the mass flow meter. The N2 flow is used in the prototype to\nreject heat and purge excess water, and the warm saturated gas cools and the water condenses in\nthe lines. This is a limitation of the measuring system used, not necessarily of the prototype.\nC. Average ambient oxygen concentration of 21, 26.5, or 34 percent O2 by volume. The prototype\nmeets this requirement, as it is capable of putting out 45 percent O2 with a chamber oxygen level\nof 21, and 60 and 67 percent O2 with chamber oxygen levels of 30 and 34 percent (see Figure 11).\nDry air bottles containing 21, 30 and 34 percent were used. The prototype meets this requirement,\nas it is capable of operating with 100 to 120 W of power at 21, 30, and 34 percent chamber\noxygen levels (reference Figure 12).\nD. Internal pressure to operate within 7.5 to 15.0 psia. The prototype meets this requirement at 10.2\nand 14.7 psia but does not at 8.2 psia (see Figure 13). This is a limitation of the PSA prototype,\nbut not necessarily the inherent technology.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n11\n\nFigure 9.\xe2\x80\x94Oxygen concentration with varying chamber temperatures at atmospheric\npressure and oxygen levels.\n\nFigure 10.\xe2\x80\x94Oxygen concentration at varying relative humidity levels and temperatures.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n12\n\nFigure 11.\xe2\x80\x94Oxygen concentration at varying chamber oxygen levels.

The prototype shows good correlation with the user-selected flow rate at atmospheric\npressure (14.7 psia). The PSA was designed for on-demand flow as well as steady flow, and is capable of\nrunning in pulsed mode at rates of 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, and 96 mL, therefore it meets requirement 1.2.2.3.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n14\n\nFigure 15.\xe2\x80\x94Power profile during start-up.\n\n3.2.3\n\nOperational Time Requirements\n\nThe PSA prototype meets requirement 1.2.3.1, as shown in Figure 15. The slight jump up in power\nindicates the prototype was plugged-in, followed by the rapid increase in power after the prototype was\nturned on. The prototype was capable of reaching steady-state conditions within 2 min of being turned on.\nThe prototype has an indicator displaying flow rate as shown in Figure 4. The prototype was run over a\nperiod of months and many test points, therefore it meets requirement 1.2.3.3. Requirement 1.2.3.2 was\nnot evaluated. The PSA prototype was run continuously for 168 hr successfully and therefore meets\nrequirement 1.2.3.4.\n3.2.4\n\nPower Requirements\n\nThe PSA prototype used a 120 VDC power supply and operated at less than 140 W of power, as\nshown in Figure 16 and Figure 17. It passes requirements 1.2.4.1 and 1.2.4.2.\nThe prototype requires the least amount of power to run at 1 lpm (about 60 W), followed by about\n90 W at 2 lpm and the same level of power (about 120 W) for both the 3 and 6 lpm conditions. All flow\nconditions require less than 360 W.\nThe prototype requires less power at lower chamber pressures, as shown in Figure 17. At atmospheric\npressure, the prototype needs about 110W of power to provide 6 lpm of oxygen with 34 percent ambient\noxygen levels and a temperature of 20 \xef\x82\xb0C. At 10.2 psia, the prototype requires about 55W of power and at\n8.2 psia it requires about 40 W of power to produce 6 lpm of oxygen flow. The data collected at 8.2 psia\ncorresponds with the data shown in Figure 13 where it does not produce the desired flow rate.\nThe PSA prototype did not have an internal battery, so it fails requirements 1.2.4.3 and 1.2.4.4 but the\nprototype could conceivably run on an appropriately sized battery.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n15\n\nFigure 16.\xe2\x80\x94Power profile during overall operation at varying flow rates.\n\nFigure 17.\xe2\x80\x94Power demands at varying chamber pressures.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n16\n\n3.2.5\n\nMiscellaneous Requirements\n\nThe PSA prototype is not portable in its current configuration due to the lack of an internal power\nsource, so it fails requirement 1.2.5.1 although it could potentially meet this requirement with\nmodifications to the prototype.\nThe prototype meets requirement 1.2.5.2, as it filters carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (shown in\nFigure 18). There is a drastic reduction in CO and CO2 levels in the first 10 min of operation. The level of\nCO2 decreases to nearly that found in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere (0.04 percent) at 20 \xef\x82\xb0C and slightly more\nthan that at 28 \xef\x82\xb0C. It also thus meets the sub-requirement in 1.2.1.6 that the partial pressure of carbon\ndioxide in the internal atmosphere be less than 0.100 psia average over any 1-hr time frame.\nThe CO levels decrease to 10 to 15 ppm after 30 min of operation at both 20 and 28 \xef\x82\xb0C, although this\nis higher than the trace amounts found in the atmospheric air of the United States (2 to 4 ppm). The\nprototype is able to output about 45 percent oxygen at both 20 and 28 \xef\x82\xb0C using dirty air in the chamber as\nshown in Figure 19. The PSA prototype does not have closed loop ventilation capability, so it fails\nrequirement 1.2.5.3. It does not have external monitoring and control capability, so fails 1.2.5.4 and is a\nlow TRL device so it fails 1.2.5.5 and 1.2.5.6.\nThe oxygen concentrator module shall provide closed loop oxygen ventilation capability for smoke\ninhalation and other medical conditions requiring oxygen.\nThe prototype meets this requirement, as shown in Figure 19. It should be noted that the highest\ntemperature tested using the dirty air mixture was 28 \xef\x82\xb0C, which may not be reflective of the environment\nin close proximity to an actual fire. There may also be additional contaminants found in smoke that were\nnot included in the \xe2\x80\x9cdirty air\xe2\x80\x9d mixture, which consisted of 20 percent O2, 79 percent N2, 1 percent CO2\nand 55 ppm CO.\n\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\nppm\xc2\xa0CO\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0C\nppm\xc2\xa0CO\xc2\xa028\xc2\xa0C\n%CO2\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0C\n%CO2\xc2\xa028\xc2\xa0C\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nCO2 Level,\xc2\xa0%\n\nCO\xc2\xa0Level,\xc2\xa0ppm\n\nCO2 and\xc2\xa0CO\xc2\xa0Concentrations\xc2\xa0\n(Dirty\xc2\xa0Air,\xc2\xa014.7\xc2\xa0psia,\xc2\xa06\xc2\xa0lpm)\n\n60\n\nTime,\xc2\xa0minutes\nFigure 18.\xe2\x80\x94Concentrations of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide utilizing \xe2\x80\x9cdirty air\xe2\x80\x9d and\nvarying temperatures.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n17\n\nO2 Concentration\xc2\xa0\n(Dirty\xc2\xa0Air,\xc2\xa014.7\xc2\xa0psia,\xc2\xa06\xc2\xa0lpm)\n\n50\n45\n40\nO2 Level,\xc2\xa0%\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n\n20\xc2\xa0C\n\n5\n\n28\xc2\xa0C\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\nTime,\xc2\xa0minutes\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFigure 19.\xe2\x80\x94Oxygen concentration using \xe2\x80\x9cdirty air\xe2\x80\x9d in the chamber.\n\n4.0\n\nElectrochemical Prototype Evaluation\n\n4.1\n\nElectrochemical Prototype Description\n\nThe electrochemical prototype, shown in Figure 20 and Figure 21 in the test chamber, was developed\nunder a Phase II SBIR contract with Lynntech, Inc. [Cisar, Balasubramanian]. The prototype was\ndelivered on September 6, 2012. It is an electrochemical stack that utilizes a cathode-air vapor feed,\nwhich was proposed on the premise that, unlike conventional electrochemical stacks, it did not require a\nliquid water feed. The prototype measured 16- by 16- by 16- in., and weighed approximately 70 lb.\nThe prototype\xe2\x80\x99s interfaces include gas ports on the front of the prototype for O2 out, Air in, and\nReturn Air out. Also on the front is an Ethernet plug connection, and an on/off switch and power and\nalarm LED lights. The O2 out and Return Air out lines had condensate collectors attached to catch\ncondensate from these lines, which were supersaturated with water that otherwise condensed and\ncollected on the floor of the test chamber. On the top of the prototype is a terminal strip for input power of\n120 VDC, and a 50 oz water reservoir that was required to provide a liquid water feed to the device, since\nthe contractor was unable to keep the stack from drying out without this liquid feed.\nThe test chamber was modified to include cooling fins on the cold plate, and a large recirculating fan\nin the chamber to improve heat rejection.\nThe prototype came with control software that allowed the user to select the delivery oxygen\nconcentration and provided data on prototype performance. The system was run under a range of\nconditions, to evaluate its performance against the draft requirements listed in Section 1.2.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n18\n\nFigure 20.\xe2\x80\x94Electrochemical prototype, inside the test\nchamber.\n\nFigure 21.\xe2\x80\x94Water reservoir for deionized water.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n19\n\n4.2\n\nElectrochemical System Performance Relative to Requirements\n\n4.2.1\n\nAtmosphere (Oxygen and Pressure) Requirements\n\nThe electrochemical prototype was designed to provide 60 percent oxygen at 4 lpm. The delivered\nprototype provided a steady-state flow of 3.2 lpm of 72 percent oxygen when the set-point was 60 percent\noxygen in the prototype software. The offset is possibly due to calibration differences in the internal\nprototype oxygen sensor and the lab oxygen sensor. This meets requirement 1.2.1.1 as shown in\nFigure 22.\nThe prototype software had a user selectable oxygen delivery concentration, so the prototype was\ncycled between 50 and 90 percent.\nAs shown in Figure 23, the prototype was able to generate oxygen concentration output of over\n90 percent oxygen, thus meeting requirement 1.2.1.2. The prototype also did not increase the ambient\noxygen in the chamber, thus meeting 1.2.1.3. The prototype was not tested to provide an output pressure\nsignificantly above ambient (~0.5 psia), and thus did not meet 1.2.1.4. The prototype uses ambient air, so\npasses 1.2.1.5. Lastly, the prototype was not designed to run at sub-atmospheric pressures, and thus did\nnot meet 1.2.1.6.\n\nFigure 22.\xe2\x80\x94Electrochemical prototype oxygen flow and concentration with\ntime for a set point of 60 percent O2.\n\nFigure 23.\xe2\x80\x94Electrochemical prototype toggled between 50 and\n90 percent oxygen.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n20\n\n4.2.2\n\nFlow Requirements\n\nThe electrochemical prototype was designed for 4 lpm oxygen flow at 60 percent oxygen, and thus\ndoes not meet 1.2.2.1. It does meet 1.2.2.2 for 2 lpm, as shown in Figure 22. It was not designed for\non-demand flow, so does not meet 1.2.2.3.\n4.2.3\n\nOperational Time Requirements\n\nThe electrochemical prototype took over 4 min to begin to produce adequate oxygen after initial\npower on and auto-sequence startup via the software, as shown in Figure 24. It does not meet 1.2.3.1.\nThe electrochemical prototype suffered a significant failure during testing that required significant\nmaintenance, and so it failed 1.2.3.2. The water reservoir unexpectedly ran dry during a 3 hr low humidity\nair test, and in reviewing the data, it appears that the internal water feed rate had increased from previous\ntests of 1.4 to 3.5 ml/min, thus draining the water reservoir at over twice the expected rate. Prior to that\nfailure, a number of tests had been performed, so the prototype passes 1.2.3.3.\nThe electrochemical prototype was deemed to be not able to operate continuously over a 7 day period,\n1.2.3.4, due to the lack of adequate heat rejection in the design, which allowed the exterior of the\nprototype to heat up beyond touch temperature limits, while simultaneously needing to remove and refill\nthe water reservoir many times during the 7 day operation. In addition, the water condensate collectors on\nthe O2 out and Return Air out would similarly need to be drained multiple times during that 7 days.\n4.2.4\n\nPower Requirements\n\nThe electrochemical prototype used a 120 VDC power supply, and operated at 600+ W of power, as\nshown in Figure 24. It passes 1.2.4.1 but fails 1.2.4.2 due to the greater than 360 W power draw.\nThe prototype did not have an internal battery, and no reasonable size battery would be able to sustain\nthat power level for 8 hr, so the prototype fails both 1.2.4.4 and 1.2.4.5.\n4.2.5\n\nMiscellaneous Requirements\n\nThe electrochemical prototype is determined to be not portable due to its weight, lack of an internal\npower source, and need for high power and heat rejection, so it fails 1.2.5.1.\nIt does not have inlet filters to protect the prototype against smoke or toxic fumes, and it uses inlet air\ndirectly to mix with the oxygen generated to produce concentrations less than 100 percent, so it fails 1.2.4.2.\nIt does not have closed loop ventilation capability, so it fails 1.2.5.3.\n\nFigure 24.\xe2\x80\x94Startup time for electrochemical prototype, showing power, current,\nand oxygen flow.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n21\n\nThe prototype does have external monitoring and control capability using the provided software, so it\npasses 1.2.5.4.\nThe prototype is a low TRL, so fails 1.2.5.5 and 1.2.5.6.\n\n5.0\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\n5.1\n\nPrototype Evaluation Summary Table\n\nBoth prototypes met some of the requirements, but not all of them, since these are prototype units and\nnot high TRL. Table 2 has a summary of the evaluation results presented here. Based on these results, of\nthe two prototypes, the PSA technology meets significantly more of the requirements.\nTABLE 2.\xe2\x80\x94PROTOTYPE EVALUATION SUMMARY\nRequirement\nPSA Prototype\nElectrochemical Prototype\n1.2.1 Atmosphere\n1.2.1.1 50% O2 min\nYes\nYes\n1.2.1.2 90% O2\nYes\nYes\n1.2.1.3 ambient PPO2 not enriched\nYes\nYes\n1.2.1.4 50+ psia**\nN/A\nN/A\n1.2.1.5 Use cabin air\nYes\nYes\n1.2.1.6 Exploration atmospheres\nYes\nNo\n1.2.2 Flow\n1.2.2.1 6 lpm maximum\nYes\nNo\n1.2.2.2 2 lpm minimum\nYes\nYes\n1.2.2.3 On demand operation\nYes\nNo\n1.2.3 Timing\n1.2.3.1 2 min startup\nYes\nNo\n1.2.3.2 2 years**\nN/A\nN/A\n1.2.3.3 Repeated use\nYes\nYes\n1.2.3.4 7 day op\nYes\nNo\n1.2.4 Power\n1.2.4.1 28-120 VDC\nYes\nYes\n1.2.4.2 < 360 W\nYes\nNo\n1.2.4.3 8 hour battery\nNo\nNo\n1.2.4.4 Switch power during ops\nNo\nNo\n1.2.5 Misc.\n1.2.5.1 Portable\nNo\nNo\n1.2.5.2 Filter smoke/fumes\nYes\nNo\n1.2.5.3 Closed loop control*\nNo\nNo\n1.2.5.4 External monitor/control\nNo\nYes\n1.2.5.5 Military airworthiness*\nNo\nNo\n1.2.5.6 Spaceflight certification*\nNo\nNo\nSummary\n14/23 Pass\n8/23 Pass\n* The prototypes were not designed for closed loop ventilation capability, since these requirements were added after the\nawards were issued. In addition, the TRL level of the prototypes was not expected to meet air worthiness or flight\ncertification requirements.\n** We did not attach the oxygen output to a ventilator, so we did not test for the delivery pressure requirement. We did not\ntest the prototype for 2 years. Those requirements are included for completeness, and since both prototypes were\ndeveloped in parallel, both are judged against the same criteria fairly.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n22\n\n5.2\n\nPSA Prototype Discussion\n\nOverall, the PSA prototype met the majority of the requirements, with a few notable exceptions.\nThese exceptions included:\n1. The OCM shall provide an output pressure of 55 to 60 psia regulated as needed as part of the\ndelivery system (reference Figure 8). We did not test this capability.\n2. Internal pressure to operate within 7.5 to 15.0 psia (reference Figure 13). Specifically, the\nprototype does not function properly at an environmental chamber pressure of 8.2 psia as it does\nnot produce the desired flow rates, although it is still able to output acceptable oxygen levels\n(see Figure 25). The appropriate conversion factors to correct the oxygen sensor for the pressure\ndependence were applied (reference Appendix B for chart).\n3. Average relative humidity level over each 24-hr period between 25 to 75 percent. Although the\nprototype meets the requirement to function within a 25 to 75 percent relative humidity range and\nis able to provide oxygen at the 6 lpm flow rate, the prototype is unable to perform optimally at\nthe high humidity levels (78 and 83 percent), which may result in overheating or other damage\nfor long operations.\n4. During operation, there was a small temperature and pressure increase over time in the chamber\ndue to the power use of the prototype (refer to Figure 7 and Figure 26 for pressure and\ntemperature changes, respectively). This is reflective of the heat up time of the prototype.\nIn conclusion, the NASA Exploration Medical Capability element should continue to pursue pressure\nswing adsorption technology for medical applications with an understanding of limitations of the\ntechnology as related to low pressure and high relative humidity environments. The PSA prototype\noxygen concentrator performed admirably in a variety of environmental chamber conditions, several of\nwhich pushed the limits of the PSA technology itself. The data collected on the PSA prototype presented\nin this report can be compared to other prototype oxygen concentrators as well as commercial units and\nevaluated against the flight requirements for an oxygen concentrator.\n\n5.3\n\nElectrochemical Prototype Discussion\n\nThe electrochemical technology has issues that make it difficult to implement in an exploration\nmission scenario. The primary issues are the very high power draw and associated heat rejection for the\nprototype. The supply of deionized water to the prototype, and the collection of excess water from the\nproduct stream and return air lines will complicate the design to accommodate microgravity fluid\nhandling. The prototype is not currently designed to operate at exploration atmospheres, and it is unclear\nif the technology will support lower pressure operations, which will exacerbate heat rejection and\ncondensation in the exhaust lines.\nThe prototype was not designed to have inlet filters since that requirement was added after the award.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218709\n\n23\n\nFigure

B.\xe2\x80\x94Calibration for Ambient Pressure Correction of\nOxygen Sensor\nThe oxygen sensor used is also a function of the ambient pressure in the chamber, so a calibration was\nconducted to correct for the internal pressure of the chamber. Two different gases were used for the\ncalibration, and the overall correlation can be used to correct the reading at any given pressure to give an\naccurate reflection of the oxygen concentration.
