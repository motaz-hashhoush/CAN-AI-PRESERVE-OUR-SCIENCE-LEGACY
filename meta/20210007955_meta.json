In this paper, we discuss a downlink receiver\r\nconcept capable of demodulating optical pulse-position modulated (PPM) waveforms with data rates varying from\r\napproximately 50 kbps up to 265 Mbps, using a range of PPM orders, slot widths, and code rates. The receiver\r\noperates on recorded timestamps corresponding to the times-of-arrival of photons detected by a photon-counting\r\ndetector array followed by a commercial time-tagger. Algorithms are presented for slot, symbol, and frame\r\nsynchronization as well as parameter estimation. Estimates of link performance are evaluated through Monte-\r\nCarlo simulation for an optical channel that includes optical losses, detector blocking, signal clock dynamics,\r\nand pointing-induced downlink fades. Based upon these simulation results, it is expected that link closure may\r\nbe achieved with at least 3 dB of margin under a variety of relevant conditions.", "title": "Downlink Receiver Algorithms for Deep Space Optical Communications", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210007955, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tkacenko, Andre"}}, "id": "15db6784f6e34cc09bd9d6848ef4f487"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210007955, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Shaw, Matthew"}}, "id": "3196ad38371147ad8058d68053f73f82"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210007955, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lay, Norman"}}, "id": "7430b0227b0944eab70a93391db21d13"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210007955, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rogalin, Ryan"}}, "id": "862a9efc1cb24e2fb6b41034267b8288"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210007955, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Srinivasan, Meera"}}, "id": "2776f753f1094e69ab09d9e313e98fba"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:16:37.7527810+00:00", "id": 20210007955, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/47766", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210007955, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2017", "id": "da2f02c93ac549519fc2650a1c9c93ef", "publicationDate": "2017-01-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
