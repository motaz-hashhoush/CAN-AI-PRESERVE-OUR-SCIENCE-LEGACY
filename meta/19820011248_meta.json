Emphasis is placed on processes of astrophysical interest, e.g., on particle acceleration, collision-free shocks, particle motion, parallel electric fields, magnetic merging, substorms, and large scale plasma flows. The general morphology and topology of the Earth's magnetosphere are discussed, and important results are given about the magnetospheres of Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury, including those derived from the Voyager 1 and 2 missions and those related to Jupiter's satellite Io. About 160 references are cited, including many reviews from which additional details can be obtained.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820011248, "id": "566779fb38444fe599788098d8219b63", "publicationDate": "1981-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19820011248.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19820011248/downloads/19820011248.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19820011248/downloads/19820011248.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19820011248/downloads/19820011248.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
