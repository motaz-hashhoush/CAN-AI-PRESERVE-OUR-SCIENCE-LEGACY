After briefly reviewing the evolution of TAB, consideration was given to factors influencing and motivating TAB, including current major problem areas. Solutions to these problems are being investigated under five Department of Defense programs. These complementary efforts are discussed and compared. The findings are contrasted against recent improvements and advancements in automated wire bonding.", "title": "Comparison of DOD tape automated bonding programs", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T13:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780008327, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Unger, R.
