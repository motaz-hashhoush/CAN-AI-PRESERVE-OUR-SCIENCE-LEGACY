Some control functions are currently included as part of the Open System Interconnection model. For local area networks, it is widely recognized that there is a need for additional control functions, including fault isolation functions, monitoring functions, and configuration functions. These functions can be implemented in either a central or distributed manner. The Fiber Distributed Data Interface Medium Access Control and Station Management protocols provide an example of distributed implementation. Relative information is presented here in outline form.", "title": "Network reliability", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T11:27:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870019724, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Johnson, Marjory J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "5937c1e2ee164bccb29a8de87ec437a2"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870019724, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870019724, "id": "f102c1a69baf47c48e7d289ed3cf4621", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Proceedings: Computer Science and Data Systems Technical Symposium, Volume 2", "publicationDate": "1985-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19870019724.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19870019724/downloads/19870019724.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19870019724/downloads/19870019724.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19870019724/downloads/19870019724.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
