More specifically, a thermal lens-forming\nmaterial is provided which has first and second opposite, substantially parallel surfaces. A reflective coating\nis formed on the first surface, and a radiation-absorbing\ncoating is formed on the reflective coating. Chopped,\nincoming optical radiation to be detected is directed to\nirradiate a small portion of the radiation-absorbing coating. Heat generated in this small area is conducted to\nthe lens-forming material through the reflective coating, thereby raising the temperature of a small portion\nof the lens-forming material and causing a thermal lens\nto be formed therein. The thus-formed thermal lens is\noptically detected by irradiating the thermal lens by a\ncollimated light beam. The light beam, after having\npassed through the thermal lens, is reflected by the\nreflective coating back through the thermal lens, and\ndirected by a beam splitter to an optical detector. In a\nfurther embodiment of the invention, the optical radiation to be detected is passed through a template, thereby\ndefining a plurality of areas on the radiation absorbing\ncoating to be irradiated. A corresponding template is\nprovided in a spread, collimated light beam to define a\nplurality of coherent light beams, each of which passes\nthrough a thermal lens in the lens-forming material.\nEach beam is then reflected by the reflective coating,\npasses back through the thermal lens, and is directed by\na beam splitter to an optical detector. The invention is\nparticularly useful as a broadband infrared detector.\n26 Claims, 9 Drawing Figures\n\nE.

The first type Of optical detector inchdes\nphotodiodes, photomultipliers, and the like. These de- *O\ntectors utilize quantum mechanical processes involving\nseparation of charge due to absorption Of a photon. The\nsecond type of optical detector includes pyr-lectric\ndetectors and thermistors. These detectors utilize all\ntypes of couplings in which a temperature change 25\ncauses a direct change in voltage, resistance o r capacitance.\nThere is a generally recognized need for a\nsensitive, broadband optical o infrared detector or\nr\ndetector array both in government and in industry. 30\nUtilizing conventional thermal detectors, high sensitivity can be achieved at certain wavelength ranges in the\ninfrared region by using detectors operated at cryogenic temperatures, one example being a Ge4u detector which operates at 1.4\' K. Alternatively, pyroelac- 35\ntric detectors can be utilized; however, these have reduced sensitivity and relatively flat wavelength response. There is a need today for o p t i d &&tom\nwhich have high sensitivity, broad wavelength nspon%es, be\nat room temperature ( 1 0 * 4 * JO\nC.) and can be easily fabricated into detector arrays.\nThe optical detector provided by the invention meets\nthese needs.\n\n,..\n\n2\n\nThe them1 lens is dissipated during periods when the\noptical radiation is blocked from the radiation absorbing\nmaterial. The thermal lens is continuously monitored by\na collimated light beam o monitoring beam which is\nr\ndirected to the volume in which the thermal lens is\nformed. This beam is orthogonally directed with respect to the reflective coating. Portions of the light\nbeam reflected by the reflective coating back through\nthe thermal lens are provided to an optical detector by\na beam splitter located in the collimated light beam. In\nanother embodiment of the invention, a plurality of\nthermal lenses are formed by the optical radiation to be\ndetected, and a plurality of optical detectors are provided to monitor the thermal lenses. Output signals\nfrom the detectors can be used to form a profile of the\nfield o view of the optical radiation to be detected.\nf\nT i contactless probing o r monitoring of the volhs\numes in which the thermal lenses are formed results in\nseveral advantages not achieved by conventional detectom. First, eiectrkal noise which is limiting for p y r e\nelectrical detecum is n m v d , thus eliminating bngent\ndelta loss and John- dge,\nA surface area\nthan 0.

However, it is to be recognized that other means\ning, The thermal energy created by the radiation to be 65 for transmitting the optical radiation to be detected to\nthe radiation-absorbing materirl, and other means for\ndetected icl thermally conducted by the reflective coat.\ndetecting the p r w n c e of thermal lenses in the lens.\nin$ to the lena-forming materirl, a nmall volume of\no\nforming material could be utilized. Accordingly, the\nwhich is heated n that a thermal lene is formed therein,\n\n*\n\n3\n\n4,262J98\n\n5\n\n4,262,198\n\nappreciated that any number of apertures defining the\noptical radiation 32 to be detected could be utilized.\nThe thermal lens detecting means can be further understood in reference to FIG. 2. In FIG. 2, the collimated light beam 28 passes through the beam splitter 34\nand into the lens forming material 12. The optical radiation 32 to be detected heats the radiation-absorbing\ncoating 16, the heat being thermally conducted through\nthe reflective coating 14 and forming a thermal lens 38\nin the lens-forming material 12. The dotted line defining\nthe thermal lens 38 is merely outlining a volume within\nthe lens-forming material 12 where the refractive index\nof the material is changed as a result of the heat generated by absorption of the optical radiation 32 to be\ndetected. The collimated light beam 28\xe2\x80\x99 is spread or\ndiffused as it enters the thermal lens 38, is reflected by\nthe reflective coating 14, and spread again as it leaves\nthe thermal lens 38. The thus-spread collimated light\nbeam 28\xe2\x80\x99 is reflected downwardly by the beam splitter\n34 and subtends an area one dimension of which is indicated by the parenthesis at 4 .In the absence of a ther0\nmal lens 38 in the lens forming material 12, the collimated light beam is reflected by the beam splitter 34 to\nthe optical detector 32 and subtends an area one dimension of which is shown by the parenthesis at 42. As one\ncan appreciate, so long as the active area of the optical\ndetector 32 is smaller than the area defined by the\nspread collimated light beam 28\xe2\x80\x99 then the output of the\noptical detector 32 will be lower than when it is irradiated by an unspread reflected collimated light beam.\nThus, the output signal 44 from the optical detector 32\nwill vary from a maximum when there is no thermal\nlens in the lens forming material 12, to a value lower\nthan the maximum when the thermal lens 38 is spreading the collimated light beam so that portions of the\nspread beam do not irradiate the optical detector 32.\nThe optical detector output 44 is shown in FIG. 3. In\nFIG. 3, the thermal lens is at a maximum as represented\nby the voltage shown at 46,and begins to dissipate until\nit is fully dissipated as represented by the voltage at 48.\nIn order to eliminate the rather large DC bias corresponding to a voltage related to the voltage at 48, an\nAC coupling means 50 is provided, the output thereof\nbeing an alternating voltage 52 shown in FIG. 4. Thus,\nthe magnitude of the alternating voltage 52 is directly\nrelated to the thermal lens 38 formed in the lens-forming\nmaterial 12,and can be displayed by any suitable display\nmeans 54 which could be a vidicon, a strip recorder, or\na display means associated with a processing computer.\nCharacteristics of thermal lenses formed in the types of\nmaterials above-described can be seen in FIG. 5. In\nFIG. 5, an optical detector output voltage 56 is shown\nfor a radiant input of 10 nanoseconds to a lens-forming\nmaterial, the output voltage 56 being related to the\nformation and dissipation of the thermal lens formed\ntherein.\nA second embodiment of the invention is shown in\nFIG. 6.The chopper 22, lens-forming laminate 10 and\nthe laser 26 are the same as in the first embodiment.\nHowever, in this embodiment the optical radiation from\nportions of an entire scene is to be detected. An optical\nradiation source 60 outputs a beam 62 of optical radiation to be detected. A first template 64 is provided between the radiation-absorbing coating 16 and the optical radiation source 60,the template 64 defining a plurality of openings, as will be explained below, so that\nselected portions of the optical radiation beam 62 to be\ndetected can pass therethrough and irradiate the radia-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n6\n\ntion-absorbing coating 16. A second template 66 is provided on the other side of the lens-forming material 12,\nthe second template 66 defining a plurality of openings\neach of which corresponds to an opening in the first\ntemplate 64.For reasons to be explained below, the two\ntemplates 64 and 66 are aligned with respect to each\nother by a holding bracket 68. A collimated light beam\n70 from the laser 26 is provided to a conventional beam\nspreader 72 which outputs a spread beam 70\xe2\x80\x99 sufficiently large to irradiate an area defined by the openings\nin the second template 66. Thermal lenses in the lensforming material 12 are formed in front of each of the\nopenings in the first template 64 and are irradiated by\nlight passing through corresponding openings in the\nsecond template 66. Light reflected by the reflective\ncoating 14 defines a reflected beam 70\xe2\x80\x9d which is reflected by a beam splitter 73 to an optical detector array\n74, the detector array 74 having a detector corresponding to each of the openings in the second template 66.\nOutputs from the detector array are provided to a display means 76. As one can appreciate, the reflected light\nbeam 70\xe2\x80\x99 actually comprises a plurality of smaller light\nbeams, each being formed by part of the spread beam\n7 0 and defined by the various openings in the second\ntemplate 66.\nAn exploded view of certain portions of the second\nembodiment shown in FIG. 6 can be seen in FIG. 7.\nReferring to FIG. 7, the first template 64 is shown in\nwhich a plurality of openings are provided. The number\nof openings can vary greatly. A typical opening for\ndetection of infrared radiation would have a diameter\nbetween 0.05 millimeters and 0.1 millimeters, and be\nspaced-apart 0.5 millimeters with respect to each other.\nOne of the openings 77 in the first template 64 allows a\nportion of the radiation to be detected to pass therethrough, that portion defining a light beam 78 which\nstrikes the radiation-absorbing coating 16. As a result of\nconduction of heat through the radiation absorbing\ncoating 16 and the reflective coating 14, a thermal lens\nT\xe2\x80\x99 is formed in the lens-forming material 12. This thermal lens T is formed in a volume intersected by the axis\nof the light beam 78 passing through the first template\n64.A portion of the collimated light beam 7 0 passing\nthrough the beam splitter 73 passes through an opening\n79 in the second template 66, this opening being positioned so that the axis of the collimated light beam\npassing therethrough will be colinear with the axis of\nthe optical radiation 78 passing through the corresponding opening 77 in the first template 64 and will intersect\nthe thermal lens T formed in the lens-forming material\n12. The collimated light beam passing through the\nopening 79 in the second template 66 is reflected by the\nreflective surface 14 and passes backwardly along its\naxis through the opening 79. It is reflected downwardly\nby the beam splitter 73. The detector array 74 is positioned so that a corresponding detector element D\xe2\x80\x99 is\nintersected by the beam of collimated light passing\nthrough the opening 79 in the second template 66. Thus,\na decrease in light intensity measured by the detector D\xe2\x80\x99\nis related to spreading of the collimated light beam as it\npasses through the thermal lens T\xe2\x80\x99. As in the first embodiment, the absence of a thermal lens T will result in\na maximum irradiation of the detector D\xe2\x80\x98, and the presence of a thermal lens T\xe2\x80\x99 will result in a spreading of the\ncoflimated light thereby reducing the intensity of light\nat the detector D\xe2\x80\x99. In a corresponding manner, each of\nthe other detectors comprising the detector array 74\ncorresponds to an opening in the second template 66\n\n7\n\n4,262,198\n\nwhich, as previously explained, corresponds to an opening in the first template 6 .Thus, each detector of the\n4\ndetector array 74 provides an output related to optical\nradiation passing through one of the plurality of openings in the first template 64.\nReferring to FIG. 8, a plurality of optical fiber bundles 84 are provided in a third embodiment of the invention. The output from the beam spreader 72 irradiates\none end of the optical fiber bundles 84, the other end\nbeing terminated in a template 66\' which is positioned\nwith respect to the first template 64 in the same way as\nthe second template 66 was positioned. The optical fiber\nbundles could be utilized whenever it would be impractical to orthogonally direct the output 70\' from the\nbeam spreader 72 at the second template 66. A second\nplurality of optical fiber bundles 86 is also provided,\neach of which is connected to one of the first plurality\nof optical fiber bundles. The second plurality of optical\nfiber bundles 86 is terminated in a detector array 74\', the\nend of each of the optical fiber bundles being oriented\nso as to irradiate an individual optical detector. The\ndetector array 7 4 again provides a plurality of outputs,\neach of which corresponds to one of the openings of the\n6.\nsecond template 6 \' Refering to FIG. 9, an enlarged\nportion of an area designated as 88 in FIG. 8 is shown.\nHere, one of the optical fiber bundles is shown having a\nbeam splitting means 90 provided therein. Light reflected from the beam splitting beams 90 is provided to\none of the second optical fiber bundles 86.\nIt is theorized that if 8 6 9 0 % of incident radiation is\nabsorbed by the thermal lens-forming material having\noutput characteristics as shown in FIG. 5, and a thermal\nlens is formed in the lens-forming material 12 by a circular chopper rotating at 20 Hz and having a 115" window, then the radiation to be detected will correspond\nto a continuous radiation level 2 8 10 Exp(-9) watts\n~\nover an absorption area of 10 Exp(-4) square centimeters. Using the above parameters, it is further theorized\nthat responsivity will be approximately equal to 2~ 10\nExp( -9) volts/watt-cm Exp(2), the noise equivalent\npower will be I . 1 X 10 Exp(- 10) watts Hz Exp(- A,\n)\nand D* will be equal to 9 X 10 Exp(7) watt Exp( - 1)Hz\nExp( - 4) cm.\nThus, it should be apparent from the foregoing description that a high sensitivity optical detector has\nbeen described in which optical radiation to be detected\nis directed to form one or more thermal lenses in a\nlens-forming material. Each thermal lens is probed by a\ncollimated light beam which, after having passed\nthrough the thermal lens, has characteristics which are\nrelated to the optical radiation to be detected.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.
