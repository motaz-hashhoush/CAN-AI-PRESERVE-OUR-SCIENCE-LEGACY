Pro clress Toward\n\nProject\'s\n\nGoals:\n\n(1). Insulin and_lGF-1\nIn order to analyze which growth factors are essential for stretch-induced muscle growth in\nv/tro, we developed a defined, serum-free medium in which the differentiated, cultured avian muscle\nfbers could be maintained for extended periods of time: The-defined medium (muscle maintenance\nmedium, MM medium) maintains the nitrogen balance of the myofibers for 3 to 7 days, based on\nmyofiber diameter measurements and myosin heavy chain content. Insulin and IGF-1, but not IGF2, induced pronounced\nmyofiber hypertrophy when added to this medium. In 5 to 7 days, muscle\nfiber diameters\nincrease\nby 71% to 98% compared .to untreated\ncontrols (73). Mechanical\nstimulation of the avian muscle fibers in MM medium increased the sensitivity of the cells to insulin\nand IGF-1, based on a leftward shift of the insulin dose/response\ncurve for protein synthesis rates.\n(54). Thus, one mechanism\nby which mechanical\nactivity stimulates\nmyofiber growth is by\nincreasing the sensitivity of the cells to insulin-like growth factors. This mechanism\nis compatible\nwith the known beneficial effects of exercise in patients with diabetes. The intracellular\nsignalling\nmechanisms by which muscle stretch increases their sensitivity to insulin and IGF-1 was examined\nin FY 1993. Using an RIA, we measured IGF-1 efflux from the cultured avian muscle cells in\nresponse to stretch. Under static culture conditions the differentiated\nskeletal muscle cells were\nfound to release large amounts of endogenous IGF-1 (1-3 nM) into the culture medium (54). When\nmechanically stimulated, the rate of IGF-1 release into the medium was significantly increased, but\nonly during the first hours after initiating mechanical stimulation.\nLonger periods of stimulation led\nto a significant decrease in IGF-1 release from the cells. We tested several different mechanical\nactivity patterns with similar results. This type of IGF-1 stretch response is compatible with a model\nwhereby stretch increases the secretion but not the de novo synthesis of IGF-1 (54). Interestingly,\naddition of collagen (type I) to cultures of differentiated\navian myofibers stimulated IGF-1 release\nfrom the skeletal muscle cultures 3 to 11 fold. Although\nIGF-1 has been shown by others to\nstimulate the synthesis of extracellular matrix molecules, this is the first time an extracellular\nmatrix\nmolecule has been found to stimulate the production of IGF-1. Since stretch is known to stimulate\nextracellular matrix production, the exogenous collagen which was used to embed the cells in our\nnormal stretch protocol may mask any long term additional stretch effect on IGF-1 production.\nThe avian skeletal muscle cells also synthesize and secrete IGF-1 binding proteins which\ncan influence the growth-stimulating\nproperties of IGF-I. We developed a ligand binding assay for\nIGF-1 binding proteins and found that the avian skeletal muscle cultures produced three major\n\nPHS398\n(Rev, 9/91)\nNumber pages cgnsecul[vely\n\nPage.\n2\nat Ihe bottom throughoul the application.

Stretch of the myofibers was found to have\nno significant effect on the efflux of IGF-1 binding proteins, but addition of exogenous\ncollagen\nstimulated\nIGF-1 binding protein production 1.5 to 5 fold (54).\n(2). Steroids\nSteroid hormones have a profound effect on muscle protein turnover rates in vivo, with the\nstress-re_ated\nglucocorticoids\ninducing rapid skeletal muscle atrophy while androgenic\nsteroids\ninduce skeletal muscle growth. Exercise in humans and animals reduces the catabolic effects of\nglucocorticoids\nand may enhances the anabolic effects of androgenic steroids on skeletal muscle.\n\nLLI\nI-(,3\nm\n\nZ\nm\n\ntj3\nZ\nn-\n\nZ\n"1I.-i\n\nF.\nI-(/)\n\n(5\nEl..\nZ,\n\nO\n!-::3\nZ\nI-Z\nm\n\nO\n(J\n\nIn our continuing\nwork on the involvement of exogenous growth factors in stretch-induced\navian\nskeletal\nmuscle growth, we have performed\nexpenments\nto determine whether\nmechanical\nstimulation\nof cultured\navian muscle cells alters their response\nto anabolic\nsteroids or\nglucocorticoids.\nIn static cultures, testosterone\nhad no effect on muscle cell growth, but 5adihydrotestosterone\nand the synthetic steroid stanozolol increased cell growth by up to 18% and\n30%, respectively, after a three day exposure. Mechanical stimulation did not alter the muscle cell\'s\ngrowth response\nto testosterone\n(12), and we are currently examining\nthe interactions\nof\ndihydrotestosterone\nand stanozolol with mechanical stimulation.\nThe glucocorticoid\ndexamethasone\ninduces atrophy of the differentiated\ncultured avian\nmyofibers after 3 to 5 days of incubation (10). Mechanical stimulation of the muscle cells for 3 to\n4 days in the presence of dexamethasone\nsignificantly attenuated this atrophic response, based\non a 79% reduction in the dexamethasone-induced\nfall in protein/DNA ratios and myosin content.\nThus, mechanical stimulation modifies the response of the muscle cells not only to insulin and IGF-1\nbut also to glucocorticoids.\nWe have extended these observations to determine whether stretch\nattenuates\ndexamethasone-induced\nmuscle atrophy by a prostaglandin-dependent\nmechanism.\nDexamethasone\ninhibited the production of the anabolic prostaglandin F2a in static muscle cultures\nand mechanical\nstimulation\nreversed this decrease (11 ). The stretch-induced\nincrease in PGF2a\nresulted partially from stretch activation of the enzyme responsible for synthesizing\nprostaglandins,\ncyclooxygenase.\nThus, mechanically-induced\nprotection of muscle fibers from the catabolic effects\nof stress-related\nhormones such as the glucocorticoids\nacts at the level of cyclooxygenase\nand\ncould be an important mechanism by which exercise protects skeletal muscle from stress-related\natrophy\nin space.\nUnderstanding\nthe molecular\nmechanism\nby which\nstretch regulates\ncyclooxygenase\nactivity and prostaglandin production could eventually lead to the development\nof\nbeneficial pharmacological\nagents in the treatment of muscle wasting and is a major focus of FY\n1994 studies.\n(3). Computerization\nof the mechanical cell stimulator and growth of myofibers in a flight certified\nbioreactor system\nWe completed\ndevelopment\nof a new IBM-based mechanical cell stimulator\nsystem to\nprovide greater flexibility in operating and monitoring our experiments. Our previous long term\nstudies on myofiber growth were designed around a perfusion system of our own design. We have\nrecently changed to performing these studies using a modified CELLCO cartridge bioreactor system\nsince it has been certified as the ground-based\nmodel for the Shuttle\'s Space Tissue Loss (STL)\nCell Culture Module. The current goals of this aspect of the project are three fold: 1) to design a\ncell culture system for studying avian skeletal myofiber atrophy on the Shuttle and Space Station;\n2) to expand the use of bioreactors to cells which do not grow in either suspension\nor attached to\nthe hollow fibers; and 3) to combine the bioreactor system with our computerized\nmechanical cell\nstimulator\nto have a better in vitro model to study tension/gravity/stretch\nregulation\nof skeletal\nmuscle size. The hollow fiber growth cartridges in the CELLCO system have been modified in our\nlab to accept differentiated\nskeletal muscle organoids, as described in (4) Preliminary\nStudies. In\naddition,\nlong term growth of three dimensional\nskeletal\nmuscle organoids\non permeable\nbiopolymers in bioreactor cartridges may be useful for subsequent in vivo transplantation\nfor gene\ntherapy studies, which is part of this renewal application.

Release of tension induces rapid atrophy of tissue cultured avian skeletal muscle cells" `-All our previous studies have emphasized mechanically-induced\nhypertrophy of skeletal\nmyofibers.\nIn order to begin examining how mechanical stimuli and growth factors interact to\nprevent or reverse decreased tension/microgravity-related\nmyofiber atrophy, we determined\nwhether release of tension on differentiated avian skeletal myofibers in tissue culture indeed causes\natrophy, as seen in adult skeletal muscle in vivo. Seven day avian skeletal myofiber cultures were\n\nZ\n-U\')\nZ\n\nreleased from their resting tension by approximately 20%. Total noncollagenous\nprotein and myosin\nheavy chain content of the cultures rapidly decreased by 40%-50% in three days (Figure 1). This\n\'tension-release" atrophy may be analogous to hindlimb suspension-induced atrophy in vivo, and\ntissue cultured mammalian myofibers will be utilized as part of this renewal proposal to study the\nrole of growth factors and mechanical\nstimulation in attenuating or reversing "tension-release"\n\na\nILl\n\nmuscle atrophy in tissue culture.\n\nn-\n\n50\no\n-::I.\n_\n\n"I"--"\n\nI--\n\nE\n=\n\n}._.>"\n\n"_\n\no_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ,-4\n\n*\n\neleased\n\n_\n\n-_\no\n\n_\n\n**p<.O03\n\n40\n0\n\n1\n\nI\n\n40\n\n.----O\n\n.____.\n1\n2\n\n1\n,.3\n\n.._..:i\n30\n\n20\n:a\n\n10\n\nDays\n\n***p<.03\n\'\n1\'\n\n\'\n2\n\n3\n\nafter tension-release\n\nTissue cultured\nskeletalyofibers(Day 7) releasedfrom theirrestingtensionrapidly\nm\natrophy,\n\nZ\n\nchain\n(2).

First, this has been approved as the ground-based\nmodel for the\nShuttle\'s Space Tissue Loss Cell Culture Module (STL).
