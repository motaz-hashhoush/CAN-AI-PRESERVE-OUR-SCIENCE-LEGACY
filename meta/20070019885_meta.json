Advanced technology offers savings to the family in utility costs and energy conservation. Solar panels on the roof of tech house provide the principal energy saving. They capture the sun's rays to heat water in pipes that run through the solar collectors. The heated water is then stored in a large, well insulated underground tank. A heat exchanger extracts beat from the water and blows it through ducts to warm the house. Tech House is well insulated for energy savings. The principal insulation is fireproof Tripolymer foam which is sprayed onto walls and ceilings in thicknesses up to six inches.", "title": "The House that NASA Built", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T23:04:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070019885, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070019885, "id": "e17ad0dc219b4c629ebcfd485556f888", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1977", "publicationDate": "1977-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070019885.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070019885/downloads/20070019885.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070019885/downloads/20070019885.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070019885/downloads/20070019885.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
