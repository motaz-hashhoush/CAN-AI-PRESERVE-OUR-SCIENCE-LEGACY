Guide members in the form of slots\nare formed in a rear portion of opposite walls of the case\nfor receiving a back plate to cover the opening and\nthereby secure the computer within the case. An opening formed in the top wall of the case exposes the keyboard and display of the computer. The back plate is\nlocked in the closed position by a key-operated plug\ntype lock. The lock is attached to one end of a hold\ndown cable, the opposite end thereof being secured to a\ndesk top or other stationary object. Thus, the lock simultaneously secures the back plate to the case and\nretains the case to the stationary object.\n\n[21] Appl.
