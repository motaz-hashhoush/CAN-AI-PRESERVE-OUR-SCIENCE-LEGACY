Gas porosity occurs because most metals have dissolved gas in the\nmelt which comes out of solution upon cooling to form empty pockets in the solidified material. Gas porosity on the surface can interfere with or preclude certain NDT methods, while porosity\ninside the part reduces strength in its vicinity. Like voids, gas porosity causes a part to be less than fully dense.\nvoids, n\xef\x82\xbe flaws created during the build process that are empty or filled with partially or wholly un-sintered or un-fused powder or wire creating pockets. Voids are distinct from gas porosity,\nand are the result of lack of fusion and skipped layers parallel or perpendicular to the build direction. Voids occurring at a sufficient quantity, size and distribution inside a part can reduce its\nstrength in their vicinity. Voids are also distinct from intentionally added open cells that reduce weight. Like gas porosity, voids cause a part to be less than fully dense.\n\n13\n\nDevelop and Capture\nBest NDE Practice\n\n14\n\nNASA/TM-2014-218560 Recommendations & Gap Analysis\n\nRound Robin Test Goals\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop in-situ monitoring to improve feedback control, maximize\npart quality and consistency, and obtain ready-for-use certified parts\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop and refine NDE of as-built and post-processed AM parts\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop voluntary consensus standards for NDE of AM parts\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop better physics-based process models using and corroborated\nby NDE\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use NDE to understand scatter in design allowables database\ngeneration activities (process-structure-property correlation)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fabricate AM physical reference samples to demonstrate NDE\ncapability for specific defect types\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Apply NDE to understand effect-of-defect, and establish acceptance\nlimits for specific defect types and defect sizes\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop NDE-based qualification and certification protocols for flight\nhardware (screen out critical defects)\n66\n\nEffect of Design Complexity on NDE\nContact: Evgueni Todorov (EWI)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Great initial handling of NDE of\nAM parts\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Report has a ranking system\nbased on geometric complexity\nof AM parts to direct NDE\nefforts\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Early results on NDE application\nto AM are documented\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Approach for future work based\non CT and PCRT\n16\n\nEffect of AM Part Complexity on NDE\nMost NDE techniques can be used for Complexity Groups\xc2\xa7 1 (Simple Tools and\nComponents) and 2 (Optimized Standard Parts), some for Group 3 (Embedded\nFeatures); only Process Compensated Resonance Testing and Computed Tomography\ncan be used for Groups 4 (Design-to-Constraint Parts) and 5 (Free-Form Lattice\nStructures):\n2\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\n\xc2\xa7 Kerbrat, O., Mognol, P., Hascoet, J.

The ASTM classes are\nused to represent part processing only and are unrelated.\n\n54\n\n55\n\nBack-ups\n\nAMSC NDT of AM standards gaps\n\nGaps Identified by AMSC NDE Working Group:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Led by Patrick Howard, GE Aviation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 28 members drawn from aerospace, automotive\nand medical industries\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mapping started May 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 September2016\n\xe2\x80\x93 One Face-to-face meeting\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Met bi-weekly \xe2\x80\x93 Web meeting\n\xe2\x80\x93 Hosted by ANSI\n\xe2\x80\x93 6 to 8 members participated\n\xe2\x80\x93 Identified 6 Standardization Gaps\n\n57\n\nConceptual Physical Reference Samples\n\nDemonstrate NDE capability\n\n58\n\nQualification & Certification/NASA MSFC AM Risk, Cumulative Criteria\n\n59\n\nQualification & Certification/NASA MSFC Guidance\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It is incumbent upon the structural assessment community to\ndefine critical initial flaw sizes (CIFS) for the AM part to\ndefine the objectives of the NDE.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Knowledge of the CIFS for AM parts will allow the NDE and\nfracture control communities to evaluate risks and make\nrecommendations regarding the acceptability of risk.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 CIFS defects shall be detected at the accepted probability of\ndetection (POD), e.g., 90/95, for fracture critical applications.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Demonstration of adequate part life starting from NASASTD-5009 flaw sizes is generally inappropriate for fracture\ncritical, damage tolerant AM parts.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It is recognized that parts with high AM Risk may have regions\ninaccessible to NDE. To understand these risks it is important\nto identify the inaccessible region along with the CIFS.\n60\n\nQualification & Certification/NASA MSFC Guidance\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Parts with low AM risk should exhibit much greater coverage for\nreliable NDE.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multiple NDE techniques may be required to achieve full coverage.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Surface inspection techniques (PT, ECT, UT) may require the asbuilt surface be improved to render a successful inspection,\ndepending upon the defect sizes of interest and the S/N ratio.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For PT, surfaces improved using machining, for example, require\netching prior to inspection to remove smeared metal.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Removal of the as-built AM surface to a level of visually smooth may be insufficient\nto reduce the NDE noise floor due to near-surface porosity and boundary artifacts.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NDE demonstration parts with simulated CIFS defects are used to\ndemonstrate NDE detection capability.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NDE standard defect classes for welds and castings welding or\ncasting defect quality standards will generally not be applicable\n61\n\nQualification & Certification/NASA MSFC Guidance\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Relevant AM process defect types used must be considered.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 AM processes tend to prohibit volumetric defects with significant\nheight in the build (Z) direction. The concern instead is for planar\ndefects, such as aligned or chained porosity or even laminar cracks,\nthat form along the build plane. The implications of this are:\n\xe2\x88\x92 planar defects are well suited for growth\n\xe2\x88\x92 planar defects generally have low contained volume\n\xe2\x88\x92 the orientation of defects of concern must known before inspection,\nespecially when detection sensitivity depends on the defect orientation\nrelative to the inspection direction\n\xe2\x88\x92 the Z-height of planar defects can be demanding on incremental step\ninspection methods such as CT\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Until an AM defects catalog and associated NDE detection\nlimits for AM defects are established, NDE acceptance criteria\nshall be for part-specific point designs.\n62\n\nQualification & Certification/NASA AM Part Classification\n\nStructural Margin Criteria\nMaterial Property\nLoads Environment\nEnvironmental
