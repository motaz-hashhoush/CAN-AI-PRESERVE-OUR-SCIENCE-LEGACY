Currently, a benchmarking standard for use in validating the accuracy of computational aeroelasticity codes does not exist. Many aeroelastic data sets have been obtained in wind-tunnel and flight testing throughout the world; however, none have been globally presented or accepted as an ideal data set. There are numerous reasons for this. One reason is that often, such aeroelastic data sets focus on the aeroelastic phenomena alone (flutter, for example) and do not contain associated information such as unsteady pressures and time-correlated structural dynamic deflections. Other available data sets focus solely on the unsteady pressures and do not address the aeroelastic phenomena. Other discrepancies can include omission of relevant data, such as flutter frequency and / or the acquisition of only qualitative deflection data. In addition to these content deficiencies, all of the available data sets present both experimental and computational technical challenges. Experimental issues include facility influences, nonlinearities beyond those being modeled, and data processing. From the computational perspective, technical challenges include modeling geometric complexities, coupling between the flow and the structure, grid issues, and boundary conditions. The Aeroelasticity Benchmark Assessment task seeks to examine the existing potential experimental data sets and ultimately choose the one that is viewed as the most suitable for computational benchmarking. An initial computational evaluation of that configuration will then be performed using the Langley-developed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FUN3D1 as part of its code validation process. In addition to the benchmarking activity, this task also includes an examination of future research directions. Researchers within the Aeroelasticity Branch will examine other experimental efforts within the Subsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) program (such as testing of the NASA Common Research Model (CRM)) and other NASA programs and assess aeroelasticity issues and research topics.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Turkey", "submissionId": 20100016316, "endDate": "2010-04-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "AVT 25th PBM Meeting", "location": "Antalya", "id": "85a41a32f54f4a4e813cacf1e8370260", "startDate": "2010-04-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100016316, "id": "7cfe80ce83884dc980444bd841129d4a", "publicationDate": "2010-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100016316.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100016316/downloads/20100016316.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100016316/downloads/20100016316.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100016316/downloads/20100016316.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
