The Atmosphere Explorer C satellite measurements of the motion of the high latitude ionosphere show that the dayside and nightside convection patterns are influenced by the interplanetary magnetic field and that the relationships between the energetic particle precipitation and the convection reversal boundaries are very complex. The existence of a magnetospheric boundary layer is consistent with the satellite observations, but its relationship to open and closed field lines cannot be determined.", "title": "Ionospheric convection at high latitudes", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T13:43:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19800005296, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Heelis, R.
