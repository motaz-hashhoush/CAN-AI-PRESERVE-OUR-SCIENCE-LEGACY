I f these tendencies continue in the award of\nFederal research, development and production contracts, w\ne\na r e on the road t o manpower chaos, economic chaos, social\nchaos, defense chaos.

Freerksen f o r his assistance in t h i s\nstudy.\n\n2\n.\n\nI\n\nthe existence of an uneven geographical pattern of federal R&D expenditures\nand recommended t h a t corrective action be taken.\n\nA second study of the\n\nsectoral a n d regional implications o f the R&D programs of federal agencies\nwas published in December, 1964, by the House Select Committee on Government Research.\n\n[13]\n\nAdditional hearings were held in the Senate in June\n\na n d July, 1965, by the Subcommittee o n Employment and Manpower [17] and in\nJuly, 1966, by the Subcommittee on Government Research [16].\n\nBoth Congress and President Johnson appear t o be in agreement t h a t the\npresent geographical distribution of federal R&D funds i s n o t s a t i s f a c t o r y\nand t h a t a more equitable pattern requires a more equal regional d i s t r i b u -\n\ntion of R&D funds.\n\nOn September 13, 1965, President Johnson issued a policy\n\nmemorandum t o the heads of federal agencies and departments directing t h a t\n\'\'research supported t o f u r t h e r agency missions should be administered n o t\nonly with a view t o producing specific r e s u l t s , b u t also with a view t o\nstrengthening academic i n s t i t u t i o n s and increasing the number of i n s t i t u tions capable of performing research of high q u a l i t y .

geographical d i s t r i b u t i o n\nof federal extramural R&D funds awarded by federal agencies t o performers\nwere requested from the National Science Foundation by the Subcommittee.\nThese data indicated an unequal geographical d i s t r i b u t i o n of federal R&D\nf o r f i s c a l year 1963.\nsummarized i n Table 1 .\n\nThe extent of the geographical concentration i s\nCalifornia, Massachusetts, and Nw York, the three\ne\n\ns t a t e s with the l a r g e s t amount of RAD funds, accounted f o r 52 percent of\nthe federal R&D funds; one-half the s t a t e s received 97 percent

awards.\n\nIn order t o consider t h e e f f e c t of subcontracting on t h e d i s t r i -\n\nbution of federal R&D funds, the Subcommittee requested inforination on the\nf i r s t - t i e r subcontracts from the ten largest prime contracts awarded in\nf i s c a l year 1963 by each agency.\n\nThese d a t a were received from 6 agencies\n\nf o r 60 prime contracts awarded i n 21 s t a t e

f i r s t - t i e r subcontracts resulted i n a more equal geographical\n\nd i s t r i b u t i o n of R&D expenditures, b u t the redistribution tended t o take place\nwithin the same number of s t a

t o get a more s p e c i f i c measure of the correlation\n\nbetween the variables, Spearman rank correlation coefficients have been\ncomputed f o r each relationship.\n\n[12, p p . 202-2121\n\nThe s

.\n\nThe\n\nreport concluded t h a t federal tax contributions , population , and number of\ns c i e n t i s t s a r e each successively more highly correlated with federal R&D\nfunds.\n\n[14, p p . 12-13]\n\nA comparison o f rank correlation coefficients of\n\n.73, .70, and .81 , respectively, indicates e s s e n t i a l l y the same r e s u l t s .\nThe s t a t e d i s t r i b u t i o n of

Recommendations\nBased on t h e i r investigations, the Subcommittee found the existing\ngeographical distribution of federal R&D funds t o be "vastly unequal" and\nagreed t h a t a more equal distribution was required t o reduce the "degree\nof inequity" associated w i t h the existing d i s t r i b u t i o n .\n\n[14, pp. 48-49]\n\nThey f u r t h e r suggested the geographical distributions of population,\nindustrial employment, s c i e n t i s t s , advanced degrees, a n d student enrollment\nas possible norms against which t o determine a more equitable and thus a\nmore equal distribution o f federal R&D funds among s t a t e s .\n\n[14, p . 49 ]\n\nSome confusion e x i s t s i n concepts involved in the Subcommittee\'s consideration of the equitable treatment o f regions with respect t o t h e d i s t r i -\n\nb u t i o n of R&D funds.\n\nOn the one h a n d , a more equitable distribution of\n\nfederal R&D funds i s viewed as a means of overcoming regional d i s p a r i t i e s\n\ni n the level a n d growth of economic a c t i v i t y , the quality of colleges and\nu n i v e r s i t i e s , and the u t i l i z a t i o n of trained s c i e n t i f i c and

the reduced achievement of other\ngoals.\n\nThe t o t a l federal expenditure process can be viewed as the attempt\n\nt o achieve an e f f i c i e n t allocation of a given budget i n the sense of maxi-\n\nmizing t h e net gains i n terms of a hierarchy of national goals.\nHere, s p a t i a l aspects a r e only implicitly involved i n the allocation\nproblem.\n\nA particular spatial allocation of funds i s implied i n the\n\ne f f i c i e n t use of the budget.\n\nGiven the hierarchy of national goals, a\n\ndeparture from t h i s spatial allocation comes a t the cost of a reduction\n\ni n

t o regional goals i n the hierarchy, the e f f e c t\ncan be judged i n terms of the.resulting additional benefits and costs i n\nthe overall achievement of national goals.\nIn f i s c a l year 1965, 1 5 percent of the federal budget was devoted t o\n\nR&D a c t i v i t y .\n\n[7, p . 41 R&D expenditures can be judged as an a l t e r n a t i v e\n\nuse of the budget i n terms of t h e i r net contribution t o the achievement of\n\n14\n\nnational objectives.\n\nIn practice, federal agencies consider R&D a c t i v i t i e s\n\nas only one of a number.of alternative ways of attaining s p e c i f i c agency\nmissions.\n\nDOD, NASA, A E C , and HEW were the source of 96 percent of federal\n\nR&D f u n d s i n 1965.\n\n[8, p . 271\n\nThus, the major p a r t of federal R&D expendi-\n\ntures a r e directed primarily a t the missions\n\nof these agencies and only\n\nsecondarily a t other national goals affected by RAD a c t i v i t y .\n\nFor the\n\nmost p a r t , only NSF has d i r e c t responsibility f o r encouraging the expansion\nof the nation\'s s c i e n t i f i c and technical c a p a b i l i t i e s ; i n 1965, i t accounted\nf o r 1.2 percent of federal R&D obligations [8, p

on the\nachievement of national goals and on the p r i o r i t i e s attached t o these goals.\n\nAn e f f i c i e n t allocation o f R&D funds implies some spatial allocation of\nthese funds.\n\nThe opportunity cost o f an a l t e r n a t i v e geographic pattern o f\n\nR&D funds is measured by a l e s s e r achievement of the s e t of national goals.\nA reallocation of a given R&D budget among

national goals.\n\nSome c r i t i c s have suggested i n effect t h a t the existing uneven d i s t r i -\n\nb u t i o n of federal R&D funds i s explained in p a r t by an i n e f f i c i e n t spatial\nallocation of R&D funds.\n\nThey contend t h a t federal agencies have under-\n\nestimated the s c i e n t i f i c c a p a b i l i t i e s of i n s t i t u t i o n s i n some regions,\n.particularly the Midwest, and t h a t this has resulted in a misallocation of\nfederal R&D funds [See, f o r example, 17, p . 5441.\n\nThe misallocation has\n\n15\n\'\n\n1\n\nbeen a t t r i b u t e d t o both the contracting procedures of federal agenties and\nI\n\ninadequate conmunications between the agencies and potential R&D performers\n[17, pp. 8-10].\n\nAlthough agency o f f i c i a l s generally a s s e r t t h a t the best\n\navailable s c i e n t i f i c and technical resources are u t i l i z e d i n agency programs,\nseveral agencies have responded t o this problem by holding regional conferences\ndesigned t o acquaint potential performers w i t h agency R&D requirements,\n\nA similar argument often made i n support of a more uniform regional\nd i s t r i b u t i o n of federal R&D funds i s t h a t the l e s s favored regions possess\nsubstantial underutilized R&D c a p a b i l i t i e s .\n\nIn t h i s case i t is argued t h a t\n\na geographic redistribution of federal R&D funds could be effected by the\nallocation of additional funds i n these regions.\n\nS t i l l assuming a given\n\nhierarchy of national goals, an e f f i c i e n t regional allocation of additional\nR&D funds would depend on the character and purpose of the additional R&D\n\nexpenditures i n relation t o the distribution of R&D c a p a b i l i t i e s . The\ne f f i c i e n t use of additional funds m i g h t r e s u l t i n a greater concentration\nof expenditures.\n\nA t any given time the regional distribution of federal R&D funds i s\nconstrained by the location and quality of s c i e n t i f i c c a p a b i l i t i e s in\ni n d u s t r i a l , university, government, and private i n s t i t u t i o n s .\n\nEven over a\n\nlonger period of time, the a b i l i t y o f federal agencies t o influence the\nlocation of R&D a c t i v i t y i s somewhat limited.\n\nThey are perhaps l e a s t\n\nr e s t r i c t e d i n decisions about\'the location o f RAD performed i n government\nlaboratories and federal contract research centers, which accounted f o r\napproximately 29 percent of federal RAD funds i n 1965.\n\nt h i s case, the existence of strong agglomeration\n\nHowever, even i n\n\neconomies might favor\n\nt h e i r location i n areas w i t h h i g h R&D concentrations.\n\n16\n\nThe regional d i s t r i b u t i o n of R&D funds t o i n d u s t r i a l , educational , and\nprivate research organizations depends t o a much greater extent on the\nexisting R&D c a p a b i l i t i e s in these organizations.\n\nMore t h a n 60 percent of\n\nthe federal funds go t o industrial organizations yet they tend t o be concentrated in fewer regions t h a n other performers.\n\nEducational i n s t i t u t i o n s\n\nare spread more evenly; however, they receive only 8 percent of the federal\nR&D.funds i n 1965.\n.\n\nA geographic redistribution of federal funds may become desirable as\n\nthe r e s u l t of p r i o r i t y changes within the hierarchy of national goals or\nthe consideration of regional goals.\n\nI n recent years, f o r example, increased\n\nemphasis appears t o have been placed in the research programs o f federal\nagencies on the development o f science education.\n\nI n response t o the\n\nPresident\'s September, 1965, memorandum "Strengthening Academic Capability\nfor\n\nScience Throughout the Country,\'\' basic research funds awarded t o\n\neducational i n s t i t u t i o n s in f i s c a l year 1967 are expected t o increase 10\npercent, while support in many other areas i s expected t o f a l l [ 7 , p . 111.\nThe allocation of R&D funds by federal agencies has also been a-ffected by\nrequirements t h a t agencies consider the e f f e c t s of t h e i r R&D policies on\nsmall business, the gold supply, labor-surplus areas, a n d , as w have seen\ne\nhere, the regional equitableness of the d i s t r i b u t i o n o f R&D funds.\nThe Equitable Treatment of Regions 1\nThe general notion t h a t federal expenditures should be distributed\ne i t h e r equitably or more equitably among regions i s n o t , as such, a very\n\'This section benefits from the discussion of the concept of equity in\na paper by Reiner [ l l ] on the use of regional allocation c r i t e r i a in regional\na n d national planning.\n\n17\n\'\n\n-1\n\nuseful guide for the spatial allocation of government expenditures;\n\nIn t h i s\n\ncontext, the idea of the equitable treatment of regions may be viewed a s an\nallocation of federal f u n d s designed t o achieve an equal regional accomplishment of one or more objectives or goals.\n\nAs w i t h national goals, regional\n\ngoals a r e l i k e l y t o be assigned different p r i o r i t i e s according t o the values\nof decision makers, so t h a t they occupy various p o s i t i o n s i n a hierarchy of\ngoals.\n\nWhen more than one goal i s considered and regional equity i s measured\n\ni n terms of the e f f e c t of federal expenditures on a hierarchy of goals, regional\nequity may e x i s t even t h o u g h d i s p a r i t i e s occur i n the achievement of s p e c i f i c\n\ng o a l s among regions.\n\nThe benefits and costs of the greater achievement o f\n\nany one objective, then, a r e measured i n terms of the resulting positive or\nnegative influences on the achievement of other regional and national goals.\nSome confusion between the concepts of equity and equality almost\ninevitably seem t o creep i n t o discussions o f the equitable treatment of\nregions.\n\nAn equitable distribution of federal funds will n o t necessarily\n\nbe an equal regional distribution.\n\nAn equitable distribution has been\n\ndefined as a distribution t h a t involves an equal regional achievement of a\nhierarchy of objectives.\n\nIn most cases, the regional distribution of\n\nfederal funds needed t o correct existing d i s p a r i t i e s among regions i s l i k e l y\n\nt o be an unequal distribution t h a t i s biased toward the l e s s favored regions.\nThe concept of an equitable regional d i s t r i b u t i o n of federal funds in\n\nany g i v e n time period depends on the t a r g e t date for attaining regional\nequity.\n\nIn a given time period, then, an equitable d i s t r i b u t i o n o f federal\n\nfunds may be one t h a t r e s u l t s i n an equal regional achievement of a\nhierarchy of regional goals, one t h a t leads t o gradually greater equality,\n\n18\n\'\n\n.,\n\nor one t h a t prevents greater inequality [ l l , p . 1161.\n\nThe notion of a n\n\nequitable d i s t r i b u t i o n of federal funds may also include the requirement\nt h a t no region should be made worse off or t h a t each region should be\nassured a t l e a s t a m i n i m u m achievement of the hierarchy o f goals.\n\nUnder\n\nthese circumstances, an equal or a more equal regional allocation o f\nfederal funds m i g h t represent an equitable allocation i n a p a r t i c u l a r t i n e\nperiod.\nRegional equity may be attained among regions;
