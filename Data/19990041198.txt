b"Payload\n\nOperations\n\nIntroduction\nThe objective of this paper is to provide the future ISS scientist and/or engineer a sense of what ISS\npayload operations are expected to be. This paper uses a real-time operations scenario to convey this\nmessage.\nThe real-time operations scenario begins at the initiation of payload operations and runs\nthrough post run experiment\nanalysis.\nIn developing this scenario, it is assumed that the ISS payload\noperations flight and ground capabilities\nare fully available for use by the payload user community.\nEmphasis is placed on telescience operations whose main objective is to enable researchers\nto utilize\nexperiment\nhardware onboard the International\nSpace Station as if it were located in their terrestrial\nlaboratory.\nAn overview of the Payload Operations Integration Center (POIC) systems and user ground\nsystem options is included to provide an understanding\nof the systems and interfaces users will utilize to\nperform payload operations. Detailed information regarding POIC capabilities\ncan be found in the POIC\nCapabilities\n\nDocument,\n\nPOIC Systems\n\nSSP 50304.\n\nand User Interface\n\nOptions\n\nThe Payload Operations and Integration Center (POIC) is an International\nSpace Station (ISS) facility that\nmanages the execution of on-orbit ISS payloads and payload support systems in coordination\nwith the\nMission Control Center in Houston (MCC-H), the distributed International\nPartner (IP) Payload Control\nCenters (PCCs), Telescience\nSupport Centers (TSCs), and payload-unique\nfacilities.\nThe POIC is\ncomprised of the Payload Data Services System (PDSS), the Enhanced Huntsville Operation\nSupport\nCenter (HOSC) System (EHS), the Payload Planning System (PPS), and the Enhanced Mission\nCommunications\nSystem (EMCS).\nPDSS acquires, stores, and distributes ISS data to the EHS, IPs, TSCs,\nand other payload-unique\nfacilities.\nThe EHS performs command processing and real-time and near-realtime telemetry processing for pre-launch\nintegration and checkout, simulation training, and flight\noperations.\nThe EHS also provides a Payload Information Management\nSystem (PIMS). The PPS\nprovides a set of software tools to automate planning and schedule payload activities.\nThe EMCS receives\nvoice, video, and data from external interfaces and distributes voice and data to the POIC user community.\nDownlink video is distributed to the payload user community by JSC. Figure 1-1 illustrates the\nrelationship\nof the POIC and its systems with the ISS, MCC-H, and the POIC user community.\n\n-H\n\nHOSC\n\nE\n\nE\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nx\nt\n\ne\n\ne\nr\nehicle\n\n/\n\nn\n\nmyloud-\n\nI\n\nn\na\nI\n\n$\n\nTSCs\n\nI\n\nucilil|el\n\nC\nCC-H\n\no\nm\n\n_-_\n\nUSOC\n\nm\n\nM\n\nEM\n\nII\n\nm\nm\n\nFigure\n\ns\n\nCS\n\n1-1. POIC Context\n\nDiagram\n\nThe POIC and its supporting systems (PDSS, EHS, PPS, and EMCS) reside primarily within the Marshall\nSpace Flight Center (MSFC) HOSC. The United States Operations Center (USOC) also resides within the\nHOSC and provides an ISS host facility where payload users can choose to control and monitor the\noperations of the onboard payloads instead of being located remotely.\nUsers choosing\nthe options\n\nremote\n\navailable\n\naccess to POIC capabilities\n\nare:\n\nand interfaces\n\nare provided\n\nseveral\n\noptions.\n\nSome of\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nobtain a copy of the EHS software to be run at the user's site\naccess POIC capabilities through X-Windows\nand Web interfaces\ndevelop Ground Support Equipment (GSE) software to interface with the POIC systems\nuse the Telescience\nResource Kit (TREK)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nor use a combination\n\nof any of the above.\n\nFor the purposes of this paper, the option that will be discussed in the scenario will be the TReK option.\nThe POIC Capabilities\nDocument should be referenced for further information\nregarding other options.\nThe TReK option is suitable for small payload and/or experiment\nteams or individuals\nthat require\nminimal ground support tools in order to monitor and control low data rate payloads. It is intended to\nsupport a single individual.\nIn a team setting, each individual on the team would need a TReK platform.\nEach TReK platform operates independently\nfrom other TReK platforms. A TReK system is a personal\ncomputer (PC) configured with Commercial\nOff The Shelf (COTS) software, shareware, freeware, and\nMarshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Mission Operations Laboratory (MOL)-developed\nsoftware to\nprovide the same basic functions as a workstation located within the POIC. Hence a remote user has the\nsame set of capabilities that are provided to a user that resides in the POIC. TReK users have local\ncontrol over their systems, and as such also have responsibility\nfor system configuration,\nsystem\nmanagement,\nand security. TReK provides users telemetry acquisition, processing,\nstorage, monitoring\nand manipulation\ncapabilities.\nTReK also provides users command and database capabilities,\nalong with\nseveral standard utilities (such as a web browser, electronic mail, word processing, etc). Since TReK is a\ncommercial\nPC and TReK users have control over their system, they are free to add other software\nproducts (user developed or COTS) to their TReK system that they find useful in their operations\nactivities.\nTo provide POIC-like capabilities,\nTReK utilizes POIC interfaces to access real-time telemetry,\nto send and receive commands,\nand transfer files between TReK and the POIC. TReK also provides\naccess to POIC capabilities to request real-time and stored telemetry, access to the Payload Information\nManagement\nSystem, access to the POIC telemetry and command databases, and voice communications.\n\nPrologue\nDr. Reilley Smart, a professor at the University of Greater Knowledge,\nis the Principal Investigator\non a\nstation experiment\nstudying fluid physics.\nThere are three people on Dr. Smart's team. His primary\nassistant Lois is a graduate student at the University of Greater Knowledge.\nDr. Smart's experiment\nuses\na special test cell that is placed in the Fluid Physics Facility Processing Apparatus\nwhich is located in an\nEXPRESS Rack in the US Element. This Facility provides the electrical interfaces, computer control,\ntemperature\ncontrol, and video support services required to conduct his experiment\noperations.\nA typical\noperations scenario involves the Facility Engineer activating the Facility, then the crew installing the test\ncell in the chamber. The experiment\nteam then activates the experiment\nby ground command and initiates\na computer program which sends commands to the facility and test cell to execute a series of test profiles.\nDuring the course of these profiles, telemetry data and downlink video are transmitted\nto the ground for\nreal-time monitoring\nof experiment\nperformance\nby Dr. Smart and his science team at the University.\nAdjustments\nto the profile can be made in real-time via ground commands from the science team. If\ncommunications\ncoverage is not available, telemetry and video from the test can be recorded onboard and\nlater downlinked\nto the science team for subsequent analysis. After completion of the experiment\nrun, the\nscience team sends commands to deactivate the test cell. The crew then removes the test cell and stows it\nfor future experiment\nperformances\nand the Facility Engineer deactiviates\nanalysis of test results, Dr. Smart can modify the computer file containing\nparameters\n\nfor future experiment\n\nruns.\n\n2\n\nthe facility. Based on their\nthe test profile to adjust profile\n\nReal-time\n\nOperations\n\nExecution\n\nScenario\n\nPreparation\n\nThe first time we dropped in to see Dr. Smart, he and his science team were preparing\nfor an upcoming\nperformance\nof their experiment.\nDuring their run the previous week, Dr. Smart's graduate student Lois\nused their TReK system to record the telemetry that was downlinked\nduring the run. During the week the\nteam analyzed the data using their favorite COTS software and decided to make some modifications\nto\nenhance science results during their next run. They identified the changes in an Operations Change\nRequest which is part of the POIC Payload Information\nManagement\nSystem (PIMS).\nPIMS is an\nelectronic information\nmanagement\nsystem used by payload users, POIC cadre, and others for increment\npreparation\ninformation\n\nand execution.\nThe primary\nmanagement\nfor controlling\n\npurpose\nchanges\n\nof PIMS is to provide\nto payload operations\n\ncentralized payload operations\nand managing\nthe products\n\nrequired to support operations execution.\nTo submit the Operations Change Request, Lois used their\nTReK web browser to connect to PIMS and submit the Operations Change Request.\nThe change request\nwas reviewed and approved for implementation\nby the POIC cadre. The team was moving out to\nimplement all of the changes required to prepare for the next run. The computer profile was modified to\nmake some of the required adjustments.\nLois accessed PIMS to transmit the revised profile to the POIC\nfor uplink to the Space Station.\nShe also updated the crew procedures in PIMS to reflect some changes\nrequired to support the revised operations scenario and used PIMS to send the procedures update to the\nPOIC.\nPrior to the run, refresher training was scheduled for the crew to review the installation\nand removal\nprocedures for the test cell since it had been a long time since they had received training on this hardware\nand experiment.\nAdditionally,\nDr. Smart had requested that the crew monitor the experiment\nrun and\nprovide some real-time feedback to the science team regarding details of the fluid phenomena\nthey were\ntrying to see. The science team had prepared a short instructional\nvideo discussing and illustrating\nthe\nscience they were looking for, what specific details they wanted the crew to look for and how they wanted\nthe crew to respond. This video had been transmitted\nto the POIC and was uplinked to the station to\nsupport the refresher training session. Lois used the TReK web browser to access the Payload Planning\nSystem to retrieve the Short Term Plan for the upcoming week. By looking at the Short Term Plan the\nteam knew they would be running on Wednesday,\nand would find out Monday afternoon the specific\nscheduled time. Until then, it was back to the classroom.\n\nExperiment\n\nExecution\n\nOur next visit to Dr. Smart wasn't\n\nscheduled\n\ntill 2:00 Wednesday\n\nafternoon,\n\nbut we got there a little early.\n\nDr. Smart and his science team were gathered in the lab making final preparations\nfor their next run.\nasked the team several questions regarding how their telemetry was sent to them and how they\ncommanded\ntheir payload.\nDr. Smart drew figure 2 on the board.\n\nWe\n\nInternational\n\nSpace Station\n\nShuttle\nSpace\n\n__/_ll_\n\nWhite\n\nSands Complex\n\nThru\n\nSSCC/\nMCC-H\n\nJSC\n\nSSCC\n\nIP Uplinks\n\nP/L\n\nI\n\nUser\n\n_\n\nData\nTelescience\nSuplxlrl\nCenters\n\nP/L\n\nMSFC\n\nPOIC/\nPDSS/\nPPS\n\nUser\n\nData\n\nU.S.\n\nP/L Uplinks\n\nP/L\n\nUplinLs\n\nP_L\nU_rO_\n\nP/L\n\nUplinks\n\nPnw.e_ed\n\nP/L\n\nData\n\nUS.\ns*_\n\nInvestigator\n\nU.S.\n\nP/L Uplinks\n\nDr. Smart indicated that their Space Station telemetry is downlinked\nfrom the Space Station via the\nTracking and Data Relay Satellite to the White Sands Facility where it is then sent to MSFC's PDSS. The\nPDSS then transmits the telemetry directly to their university where it is routed to their TReK\nworkstation.\nOn the other hand, their commands\nare sent to the POIC's EHS where it checked to ensure\nthat there are no hazardous commands and that the source and destination of the commands are valid.\nThe EHS then forwards the commands to JSC's MCC-H where it is sent to White Sands, uplinked to\nTDRS, and then to the Space Station.\nDr. Smart also mentioned that he received command responses\nlet him know that his command was successfully received by JSC and then the onboard flight system.\nSmart also indicated to us that he is required to identify his telemetry and command requirements\n\nthat\nDr.\n\npreflight, to ensure that communication\nlinks are properly established between his university and the\nMSFC. As part of this input, his team arranged to receive multiple telemetry streams from PDSS.\nDr. Smart then focused\n\nour attention\n\non Lois who was setting\n\ntelemetry they were interested in for this run. Although\nstreams, they were only interested in one of the streams\n\nup their TReK system to capture\n\nthe\n\nPDSS would be sending them several telemetry\nfor this run. Lois started the TReK telemetry\n\nprocessing software and identified the stream they were interested in. She knew that they wanted to\nrecord the stream, but decided she would wait and turn the recording on once they got to the important\npart of the run. Since they weren't interested in analyzing the data from the first part of the run there was\nno need to record it. She knew that if they decided they wanted the data at a later date, they could always\nuse their TReK web browser to access POIC services to submit a request to have PDSS redistribute\nthe\ndata.\nWhile Lois was finishing her preparations\nfor the upcoming run, we got a briefing about the latest\noperations activities.\nThe refresher training that morning went great. The crew watched the video and\nthen stepped through the procedure updates. Since they had a few questions, the POIC enabled Dr. Smart\non the Air-to Ground voice loop. Since the team's TReK system is equipped with voice communications\n\n4\n\nsoftware\nandamicrophone,\nDr.Smart it tocommunicate\nused\nwiththeCrew discuss\nto\n\nthe changes and\nanswer their questions.\nAlter the voice conference with the Crew, everyone felt more prepared and ready\nfor the next run. She then accessed PIMS to store the command file she had created earlier that contained\nthe revised profile information\nand the commands that would start the automated experiment\nrun. A few\nminutes later she accessed\nthe TReK command software to verify that the file had been uplinked.\nSince Dr. Smart had concluded\n\nthe briefing,\n\nwe turned our attention\n\nback to the team.\n\ncompleting\ntheir standard pre-support\ncommunications\nchecks. During\nran into a few problems with the communications\nlines. They contacted\nover a voice loop to work the problem.\nready to go.\n\nAfter a few minutes,\n\nthe problem\n\nThey were now\n\nour briefing with Dr. Smart, they\nthe POIC Communications\nteam\nwas resolved\n\nand now they were\n\nRight on schedule, telemetry started to appear on the telemetry displays. Everything\nlooked nominal - the\nEXPRESS Rack and Fluid Physics Facility Processing Apparatus were powered up and telemetry\nindicated they were ready for the experiment\nrun. The voice loop on their TReK system came alive with a\ncall from the Facility Engineer reporting the facility had been activated by the crew and they were starting\nto install the test cell per the revised crew procedures.\nA few minutes later, Lois heard over another voice\nloop that she had been enabled for ground commanding,\nso she was ready to complete the ground portion\nof the experiment\nactivation as soon as the crew finished installing the test cell. Per the procedures,\nthe\ncrew called down on the Air-to-Ground\nvoice loop and reported that the test cell was installed and ready\nto go.\nAt this point, Lois called up several displays on the TReK system to verify the experiment\nconfiguration.\nShe then proceeded to send the commands to the experiment\nto complete the experiment\nactivation. As\nshe sent the commands,\nshe verified their receipt and execution by monitoring the downlink telemetry on\none of the displays.\nAs scheduled, the video appeared on her monitor and Lois turned on the VCR. Using the voice loop she\nmade one last call to the POIC to have the cadre relay to the crew that they needed to be available in 10\nminutes to monitor the experiment\nrun and voice down their observations.\nDr. Smart and his science\nteam intently watched the TReK displays as the data came in. A few days ago they had built some new\ndisplays that used both tabular layouts and graphs to display the data. They could see that their new\ndisplays were an improvement\nover their earlier ones. Since they were now coming up on the important\npart of the run, Lois turned data recording on so their TReK system would record the telemetry stream for\nlater analysis.\nTwenty\n\nminutes\n\nlater ....\n\nSince their TReK system was equipped with an Acquisition of Signal/Loss\nof Signal (AOS/LOS)\nprediction\nutility, Lois could see that they were coming up on a Loss of Signal. According to the schedule\nthe Loss of Signal was expected to last about 10 minutes.\nLois knew that they would not lose any data.\nThe data would be captured on board the station and then dumped to the ground.\nWhen the data was\ndumped to the ground PDSS would distribute the data and tag it as dump data. The time period of the\ndownlink of the dump data is in the data flow timeline. The team would then be able to receive the realtime data stream simultaneously\nwith the Dump (recorded) data stream and have their TReK system\nrecord both streams at the same time.\nDuring the LOS, Dr. Smart and his team did a quick analysis of the experiment\nprogress and discussed\nany changcs to the experiment\nsettings that needed to be made when they regained communication\nwith\nthe experiment.\nJust prior to the AOS period, Lois verified that the dump is scheduled to start just after AOS. She\nconfigured the TReK system to receive the Dump telemetry stream in parallel with the real-time stream.\nA few minutes later, when they entered the AOS period, they were receiving and recording both the realtime stream and the dump stream simultaneously.\nA short time later, the Facility computer finally\n\nreached\ntheend\noftheautomated andsent messagethe\nprofile\na\nin telemetry\nstream\ntoannounce\nthatthe\nrunwas\ncomplete.\nLoisturned\nofftheVCRand\nthenstarted\nthedeactivation\nprocedure.\nUpon\ncompletion\noftheground\ncommanded oftheprocedure, used\nportion\nshe thevoice tonotify\nloop\nthePOIC\ncadre Facility\nand\nEngineer\nthatshe readyorthecrew\nwas\nf\ntoremove\ntheTest elland handinghe\nC\nwas\nt\nrestoftheoperations totheFacility\nover\nEngineer.

Dr. Smart and\nLois were staring intently at a graph on their TReK system. They told me that they had just received some\ndata from PDSS that filled in some gaps. Dr. Smart had analyzed the data and video from the experiment\nrun and thought they were getting really close. The crew had given them some really valuable insight into\nwhat was really happening,\nthings they just couldn't get from the video and data. For their next run, he\nwanted to make some slight adjustments\nto the profile and leave everything else the same. He needed to\nget in the Operations Change Request for a file uplink of the revised profile\nfew changes in the Short Term Plan. No big deal.., business as usual.\n\nand he needed\n\nto include\n\na\n\nConclusion\nThis fictional scenario used a simplistic approach to convey the payload operations capabilities\navailable\nto remote users and to convey the relationship\nbetween the remote user and the cadre.
