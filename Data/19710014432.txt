S . Marriott\nand\nT. P. Sciacca, Jr.\nGoddard Space Flight Center\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe primary objective of this investigation was to locate an accelerator capable of firing simulated\nmicrometeoroid particles at velocities of 20 to 25 km/s under thefollowing constraints:\n(1) The projectile mass should be fixed, and the accelerator should be able to fire 10-6-g projectiles.\n(2) Each firing should result in multiple impacts on the specified target.\n\nA request for information on such an accelerator prompted only one reply-from Rhodes and\nBloxsom, Canoga Park, California. An evaluation was undertaken to obtain preliminary data on micrometeoroid impact on solar cells for missions through the asteroid belt and to ascertain the usefulness\nof a hypervelocity impact facility for future studies. This document contains an evaluation of the tests\nconducted at the contractor\'s facility.\nPROJECTILE ACCELERATOR\n\nThe projectile accelerator (Figure 1) uses an electrical arc discharge to heat hydrogen gas in a\nclosed chamber to a temperature of 30,000" K and a pressure of 25,000 psi. A tungsten electrode in\nthe hydrogen chamber receives power from a capacitor bank with a storage capacity 15,000 joules. A\nof\nconical expansion nozzle is attached to the exit port the hydrogen chamber. A Mylar diaphragm is\nof\nused to seal the exit port. The projectiles are attached to the Mylar diaphragm with scotch tape on the\nhydrogen chamber side of the diaphragm. The specimens are mounted perpendicular to the axis of the\nexpansion nozzle at a distance of approximately 6 ft.\nThe entire apparatusis enclosed in a vacuum chamber, and fittings were made to cool the specimens to the cryogenic temperature selected for the experiment, - 135\'C. The 1- by 5-ft viewing ports\n\n*This report is a republicationof NASA-Goddard Space Flight CenterDocument X-735-69-518, November\n\n1\n\n1969.\n\nVACUUMCHAMBER\n\nTO CAPACITOR BANK\n\nI\n\nHYDROGEN\n\n-\n\nCRYOGENIC\n\nSO LAR-C E L L\nARRAY\n\nCONE\n\n?I\n-\n\n~\n\n"\n.\n\n-\n\nPROJECTILESTAPEDTOCONCAVESIDE\nI\n\nTUNGSTEN\nELECTRODE\nFigure I-Accelerator schematic diagram.\n\non both sides of the vacuum chamber (not shown in Figure 1 ) permit the use of photodetectors and a\ncamera for velocity determination.\nThe fact that only one contractor responded to the request for services simplified the evaluation.\nThe main objective was to determine maximum projectile velocity. The contractor proposed measuring projectile velocity with a smear camera, and verifying the measurement by calculating the P/d* values from craters made by the projectiles in 2219-T37 aluminum. The agreement stated that a P/d\nvalue of 2.65 for the projection of glass spheres into 2219-T37 aluminum corresponds to a velocity of\n25 km/s. While this relationship was being verified, it was disclosed that the P/d values used by the\ncontractor came from a curve obtained from smear camera data, and not from an existing formula for\nPld.\nHowever, several formulas do exist for deriving P/d. They are the result of both experimental\nand theoretical studies. In one of Bjork\'s papers on hypervelocity impact (Reference 1 ) he states the\nP\nfollowing formula for depth of penetration when aluminum targets and aluminum projectiles are\nused :\n\nP = 1.09(mvp3 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\nP = depth of penetration (cm),\nm = projectile mass (g),\nand\n\nv = projectile velocity (km/s).\n*The ratio P/d is a nondimensional crater parameter, which relates the depth of penetration P of a projectile into a target to the\ndiameter d of the projectile. Investigators used this ratio to characterize projectile velocity.\n\n2\n\nFor an aluminum projectile with a mass of\ng and a velocity of 25 km/s, Equation 1 * gives a\ncm. A spherical aluminum projectile of 10-6-g mass and 2.7-g/cm3 density\nvalue of P = 3.18 X\ncm, and from this, a P / d of 3.57. This formulation is\ngives a particle diameter of 89 pm, or 8.9 X\nfor the projection of aluminum spheres into\naluminum targets. Investigators (Reference 2) have stated\nthat penetration is an exponential function of the ratio ofprojectile and target densities:\n\nwhere\nP = depth of penetration,\np = projectile density,\nP\np, = target density,\n\nand\n\nO<n<l.\nBecause the densities of glass and aluminum are fairly close (2.5 g/cm3 and 2.7 g/cm3, respectively), the ratio (p,/p,)" is fairly insensitive to the choice of exponent n . Denardo** suggests the use\nof n = 0.425. Combining Equation 2 with the equation developed by Denardo and others (Reference\n3) for hard-aluminum targets, we find that\nPld = 3.12 1X 1O-3di/18v2\'3\nyields\nP / d = 3.12 1 X 1O-3d1/i8v2/3\n-\n\n,\n\nwhere\nP / d = dimensionless ratio relating depth of penetration to projectile diameter,\nd\n\n= projectilediameter (ft),\n\nv\n\n= projectilevelocity(ft/s),\n\np,\n\n= projectile density (g/cm3),\n\np,\n\n= target density (g/cm3).\n\nand\n4\nFor a glass sphere of 10\'6-g mass at 25 km/s, Equation yields a value of P / d = 3.62.\n\nBecause the contractor contended that the\nforegoing formulation did not apply to glass projectiles and aluminum targets, particles consisting of\nboth glass and aluminum sphereswere used for one\n*This formula is of particular interest because the contractor claims\nthat it agrees with his experimental data.\n**Personal communication.\n\n3\n\nof the test runs. It was believed that the resuitant crater distributionwould be useful in the derivation\nof projectile velocity and would also clarify the validity of the foregoing equations for the glass projectile, aluminum target configuration.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the contractor used a smear camera to determine projectile velocity.\nThe limitations of this technique are described under test\nresults.\nAn attempt was then made to develop an optical-sensing system capable of determining projectile\n\nvelocity (Figure 2). Two photomultiplier tubes were placed adjacent to one of theviewing ports of\nthe accelerator chamber. Narrow-bandpass filters were placed between the photomultiplier assembly\nand the viewing port. The outputs of the photomultiplier were fed to a dual-beam oscilloscope. The\nfilters were selected to permit passage of a spectral wavelength characteristic of silicon. Oscilloscope\nobservations gave the flight time of theglass projectiles over the fixed distance between the two photomultiplier tubes; from the flight time the velocity was derived. (Lack of time and available equipment greatly hampered the development of this apparatus.)\nSOLAR CELLS\n\nBowman and others (Reference 4) investigated solar-cell performance after hypervelocity impact\nat much lower velocities (2.65 km/s). Fager (Reference 5 ) reported on solar cells subjected t o comparable velocities.* Fager reports certain conclusions which appear to oppose the accepted theory of\nhypervelocity impact. For example, he states in his concluding remarks that penetration is not affected\nby an increase in projectile velocity in the 60,000- to 9OyO0O-ft/srange (i.e., 18.3 km/s to 27.4 km/s).\nTherefore, the reason for selecting solar-cell panels as test specimens was twofold: to obtain data on\nsolar-cell degradation on impact by hypervelocity projectiles at 25 km/s and to clarify certain aspects\nof Fager\xe2\x80\x99s test results.\nSELECTION OF PROJECTILE FLUX\n\nBefore the test was conducted, it was necessary to select the size and quantity of projectiles to be\nfired at the solar-cell test panels. It was decided to conduct two tests: one with 10-6-g mass projectiles (Figure 3), and one with 1O-8-g mass projectiles. The contractor claimed that he could fire a mix\nof projectiles having a preselected mass distribution. Although variable mass is an important characteristic of all micrometeoroid flux models, in this testan uncontrolled mass distribution would have made\nit impossible to determine the mass of the projectile causing specific solar-cell damage.\nKessler\xe2\x80\x99s detailed report** describes the meteoroid environment to be expected in the course of a\nJupiter flyby mission. Assuming the conditions of the\nKessler model for a 600-day flight, we have\n\n*Rhodes and Bloxsom performed the experimental work.\n**Kessler, D., \xe2\x80\x9cTheInterplanetaryMeteoroidEnvironment,\xe2\x80\x9dMannedSpacecraftCenterunpublishedmanuscript,April\n\n4\n\n1969.\n\nCRYOGEN IC\n\n0\n\nEXPANSION CONE\n\nSOLAR-CELL\nARRAY\nI\n\nI\n\n4\n\nI\n\nI\n\nL\n\nI\n\nFILTER\nCOLLIMATOR\nUBEHOUSING\n\nVIEWING PORT\n\nVACUUM\nCHAMBER\n\n\'0\n\nDUAL-BEAM OSCILLOSCOPE\n\nFigure 2-Photomultiplier device schematic.\n\nand\n\n3\nA\n\n,-1.207\n\n, 10"j Grn < 10\' ,\n\nwhere\nNo\n- the number of asteroidal impacts per unit area,\nA\n\n"\n\nNc\n\n- the number of cometary impacts per unit area,\n\n"\n\nA\nand\n\nm = micrometeoroid mass (g).\nEquations 6 and 7 represent a nominal-flux model; therefore, the values obtained should be adjusted to give the Kessler maximum-flux model to obtain worse-case results.

Applying Equation 9\nfor a micrometeoroid of mass\ng yields N T = 3.0. Because three impacts would not produce\nenough information to be statistically meaningful, each test panel was subjected to approximately 100\nimpacts.

When the capacitor bank\ndischarged to explode the tungsten electrode and initiate acceleration, the field created deflected the\noscilloscope trace, causing the initial edge of the upper trace to lost. A more refined technique\nbe\n(Reference 6), using photomultipliers, should be considered in future testing.\nThe smear camera technique (Table 2)used by the contractor to obtain\nprojectile velocity involves many uncertainties. The smear camera is positioned so that it can photographically record the\nprogression of the shock front. (The term \xe2\x80\x9cshock front\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses projectiles, Mylar-diaphragm\nfragments, gases, and any debris that might be accelerated down the vacuum chamber.) The image\nappears on the rapidly moving (5000 frames/s) film in the form of a slanted streak (Figure 4), the\nslope of which is used to calculate the velocity of the shock front. Note that the image on the film is\nactually a series of streaks of various slopes.\nThe contractor maintains that the streaks corresponding to solid particles can be distinguished\nfrom those caused by gases. Furthermore, he contends that the streaks corresponding to projectiles\ncan be distinguished from those caused by other solid debris if it is assumed that all Mylar-diaphragm\nfragments and other fragmentary particles are larger than the projectiles and therefore move slower.\nThe investigators take issue with the latter assumption.\nTable 2-Contractor\xe2\x80\x99s test report.\n\nProjectiles\n\nObtained by\n\nGlass (Run 1)\nAluminum (Run 1)\nGlass (Run 2)\n\n21 .o\n21 .o\n27.9\n\n12.5\n19.5\n26.0\n\nIf it can be assumed that the solids and gases can be differentiated on the film, it must also be assumed that vaporization of solids does not occur. However, the exploding Mylar diaphragm produces\nparticle sizes ranging from large irregular fragments to vapor. It is therefore erroneous to assume that\nall the Mylar particles necessarily travel slower than the projectiles.\nThe physical dimensions of hypervelocity impact craters can be very useful in the derivation of\nprojectile (impact) velocity.* Before the existing formulas can be applied, the following must be\nknown:\n(1) Projectile density.\n\n(2) Target density.\n*Impact velocity and projectilevelocity will be used interchangeably.\n\n8\n\n(a) Test run 1\n\n(b) Test run 2\n\nKeDi\n\nstance\n\nFigure 4-Smear camera photographs.\n\n9\n\n(3) Projectile mass.\n(4) Projectile shape (which need not be precisely known).\n\nAlthough it appears that these parameters may be\neasily evaluated, the accelerator contains at\nleast two sources of unwanted projectiles: the Mylar diaphragm and the exploding tungsten electrode.\nOne must therefore determine which craters are made by preselected projectiles and\nwhich are caused\nby "debris."\nIf the periphery of the crater is not approximately circular, it is assumed that the craterwas made\nby an irregular particle. However, the converse is not true; nonspherical particles can produce nearly\ncircular outlines. Projectiles traveling at hypervelocity speeds vaporize on impact, causing localized\nvaporization and flow in the target. Therefore, a fairly irregular projectile can make a crater which is\ndifficult to distinguish from a crater caused by a spherical projectile. Also, extremely irregular projectiles (with respect to sphericity) can form sphere-like craters if properly oriented at the time of impact\n(Reference 7).\nTable 3 contains projectile-crater data taken from the aluminum witness plate in the center of the\nsolar-cell test panel. The ratio P/D is another nondimensional crater parameter, which relates the\ndepth of penetration P of a projectile into a target to thediameter D of the crater measured in the\nplane of the undisturbed surface. Table 3 does not include craters* with noncircular diametersor craters containing any residue. It contains only data from test run 1, which was made with a 3-to-I glasssphere-to-aluminum ratio, the mass of the spheres being 10-6 g (Figure 4). The craters were characterized by means of a Bausch and Lomb microscope having a vertical adjustment graduated in microns.\nA 20X objective and a 1OX ocular were used for all data recorded.\nCrater data on test run 2 were not usable because it was difficult to distinguish between impact\ncraters and surface imperfections in the aluminum witness plate.\nTo obtain the\nmaximum velocity value, it is necessary to divide the largest value of P in Table 3\nby the smallest diameter of the projectiles fired. The aluminum projectiles were 90-pm-diameter\nspheres, and the glass projectiles were 1 IO-pm-diameter spheres; therefore, using the diameter of the\naluminum sphere yields P/d = 1.58. This value corresponds to a velocity of 6.6 km/s when Equation 4\nis applied. Closer examination of Table 3 reveals that of the 45 craters characterized, 43 can be\ngrouped into three size ranges:\nP (depth\npenetration)\nof\n26 to 58 pm\n79 to 9 8 p m\n120 to 140 pm\n\nCraters\nNumber\nof\n22\n14\n7\n\nThis distribution might indicate that thecraters resulted from the fragmentation of projectiles.\nThe effective diameter of the impacting projectile would then be smaller and the corresponding P/d\n*One crater was omitted from the table which, because of its dimensions (P= 445 pm, D = 1080 pm), is believed to have been\ncaused by debris.\n\n10\n\nTable 3-Impact crater data.\n~.\n\nPenetration\nDepth,\nP\n\nCrater\nDiameter,\nD\n\nP/D\n\n~\n\nPenetration\nDepth,\nP\n\n-~\n~\n\nCrater\nDiameter,\nD\n\nP/D\n\n~\n\n23.5\n25.5\n26.0\n26.2\n29.3\n29.5\n29.8\n30.1\n30.5\n30.7\n34.3\n39.5\n41 .O\n43.5\n46.5\n47.0\n51.0\n52.2\n52.3\n5 2.4\n57.0\n58.2\n66.0\n~"\n\n63\n70\n84\n95\n105\n95\n105\n105\n95\n105\n126\n147\n147\n147\n168\n168\n189\n168\n178\n189\n189\n178\n210\n"\n\n-\n\n0.37\n0.36\n0.3 1\n0.28\n0.28\n0.3 1\n0.28\n0.29\n0.32\n0.32\n0.27\n0.27\n0.28\n0.30\n0.28\n0.28\n0.27\n0.39\n0.29\n0.28\n0.30\n0.33\n0.3 1\n\n252\n273\n252\n252\n23 1\n23 1\n294\n294\n273\n273\n294\n273\n273\n315\n357\n378\n378\n357\n399\n420\n420\n400\n\n79.0\n81.0\n81.5\n82.0\n83.2\n83.5\n84.5\n86.0\n86.5\n87.0\n90.0\n92.0\n93.0\n98.5\n120.5\n124.5\n124.8\n128.0\n137.0\n139.0\n141.0\n141.5\n- - - - .. .\n\n.\n\n0.3 1\n0.30\n0.32\n0.33\n0.36\n0.36\n0.29\n0.29\n0.32\n0.32\n0.3 1\n0.34\n0.34\n0.3 1\n0.34\n0.33\n0.33\n0.36\n0.34\n0.33\n0.34\n0.3 5\n\n"\n\nvalue would be larger. However, if fragmentation of projectiles did occur, it would be impossible to\ndetermine theP/d values because the resulting diameter of the fragments would be unknown.\nIn addition, it is improbable that all 45 craters tabulatedin Table 3 resulted from fragmented proused when constant projectile mass is required.)

Figure 6 shows the solar-cell test panels after micrometeoroid exposure, with\nthe aluminum witness plates moved slightly off center to show the overall darkening of the test panel\nafter exposure. This darkening of the test panels caused a decrease in cover-slide transmission. An attempt to clean the test panels before electrical characterization was not entirely successful (Figure 7),\nand the cover slides were removed. Figure 9 and Table 5 give the results of the electrical testing. Table\n6 lists the percent of current loss at various voltages.\nBecause the test panels were darkened by exposure, it was impossible to determine the percentage\nof degradation of cover-slide transmission resulting from projectile impacts. Figure 9 shows that most\nof the damage was confined to the cover glasses. The loss in current caused by the cover glasses and\nadhesive accounts for the higher curve after glass removal. Current-voltage curves for this solar-cell\nconfiguration are typically 4 to 8 percent lower in current with the 6-mil cover slides than without\nthem.\nTable 5-Effects of cleaning and glass removal on postexposure opencircuit voltage (Voc).\nPanel A\nMeasurement\n\nDegradation\n\n(%I\n\nT\n\nPanel B\n\nI\n\nvoc\n\n(VI\n\nI\n1\n\nDegradation\n(%>\n\n~\n\nInitial\nAfter exposure\nAfter cleaning\nAfter glass removal\n\n9.5\n7.2\n8.4\n9.0\n\n-\n\n24\n12\n5\n\n*This section is an abstract of a personal communication from N.

Pro2,\njectile velocity was not obtained for test run because it was impossible to distinguish craters in the\nwitness plate. The darkening of the test panels during exposure complicated the evaluation of solarcell damage. The following conclusions have been drawn:\n(1) Most of the damage was confined to the cover glasses.\n\n(2) Cracks in solar cells did not always result in failure of the cell; panel 1 had many more\ncracked cells than panel 2.\n(3) Conclusions cannot be drawn from space-flight data because projectile velocity is uncertain\nand analysis of cover-slide transmission is complicated by darkening of the panels.\nThe fact that the magnitude of impacts the tests is much higher than that expected on flight\nin\na\nthrough the asteroid belt does not exclude the possibility of using the flight data. For example, if\ndamage to solar-cell arrays at these fluxes is minimal or negligible, the data can be safely extrapolated\nto lesser fluxes.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIn its present state, the facility cannot be used for micrometeoroid simulation except in tests\nwhere only relative data is required (e.g., several hull composites tested side by side on the same shot)\nand projectile velocity is not critical. The facility cannot be used for general micrometeoroid simulation without the following changes:\n\n( I ) Determination of projectile velocity by additional instruments that function independently\nof the smear camera.\n\n(2) Use of a technique for determining projectile integrity during the flight.\n(3) Removal from the test run of material responsible for darkening the test specimens.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors wish to thank Mr. J.
