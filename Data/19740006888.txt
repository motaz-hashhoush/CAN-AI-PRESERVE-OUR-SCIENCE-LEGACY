Abstract:\n\nThe boundaries of application of ERTS and aircraft data are established for St. Thomas\nHarbor within which useful water quality information can be obtained. In situ physical,\nchemical and biological "water quality" and benthic data were collected. Moored current meters were employed. Optical measurements of solar irradiance, color test\npanel radiance and water absorption were taken. Procedures for correlating in situ\noptical, biological and chemical data with underflight aircraft 12 S data and ERTS-1 MSS\nscanner data are presented based on Grumman developed calibration techniques. Comparison of Bulk and Precision CCT computer print out data for this application is made,\nand a simple method for geometrically locating bulk data individual pixels based on land\nwater interface is described. ERTS spacecraft data and I2 S aircraft imagery are correlated with optical in situ measurements of the harbor water, with the aircraft green\nphotographic and ERTS-1 MSS-4 bands being the most useful. The biological pigments\ncorrelate inversely with the optical data for inshore areas and directly further seaward.\nAutomated computer data processing facilitated analysis.\n\n17.

(The primary sewage treatment plant is scheduled to come on line in the fall\nof 1973).\nSCOPE OF WORK\n* Calibrated color test panels, identifiable on the aircraft I 2 S multiband photographic imagery were placed on Brewer\'s Bay Beach parking field. The parking\nfield is composed of coral sand, has an area approximately 300 feet by 1200 feet\nand was detectable by the spacecraft MSS scanner. Ground optical photometric\ndata were acquired of the color test panels and the coral sand.\n\nThese measure-\n\nments were recorded simultaneously with aircraft underflight passes and about\none half hour preceding ERTS-1 pass. They enabled quantitative establishment\nof aircraft and ERTS-1 photometric levels.\n\nThis accurate establishment of\n\nphotometric levels provided the basis to precisely quantify the water radiance in\nrelation to the biological and chemical parameters.\nCONCLUSIONS\n* Ground truth data is necessary to properly interpret ERTS-1 MSS Scanner\nRadiance Values, ie, to correlate turbidity with physical, chemical and\nbiological water properties.\n* There is a correlation between the optical in situ data, the aircraft I2S\ngreen and red imagery and the ERTS-1 MSS band 4 and 5 data.\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\niii\n\ne The water characteristics of turbidity also correlate well with these data.\n* Chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments inversely correlate with turbidity near\nthe sewage effluent and directly correlate toward the seaward direction.\n*\n\nTurbidity correlated inversely with benthic species diversity, furnishing an\ninferential tie between an easily sensed water quality variable and a sensitive\nindicator of average "water quality" conditions.\n\n* Computer processing assisted in revealing correlation by calculating correlation\nmatrices, performing factor analyses, producing graphical representations of\ndata useful for first look analyses and producing print outs of MSS data for\ndetail analysis of specific areas.\n*\n\nBulk CCT MSS, Band 4, computer print out quantum value contours of St. James\nBay, St. Thomas match very closely the charted bathymetric contours where\nthe bottom was visible, the water of uniform clarity, and depths approximately\n30 feet or less. Bathymetric charting of coastal areas within these limitations\nappears to be a promising application of ERTS data.\n\n* The need for high radiometric fidelity dictated the use of bulk rather than\nprecision data. Further the necessity of accurately locating (within 2 pixels)\nthe MSS data precluded the use of MSS imagery for this experiment.\ne Bulk CCT print outs can be utilized in coastal zone investigations rather than\nprecision data, even for those objectives requiring high positional accuracy,\nby constructing a grid scaled to match the computer print out to the reference\nchart being used.\n\nMSS band-7 delineated the land-water interface boundary\nused in constructing the grid.\ne Registration of the 4 MSS spectral bands to each other was within one pixel as\nshown by comparing ERTS-1 bulk print outs with the aircraft I2S imagery of the\ntest site.\ne\n\nThe geographical location accuracy of the ERTS-1 bulk CCT data is + 1 pixel (i. e.\nh 80 m along the track and \xc2\xb1 57 M across the track) for the St. Thomas Harbor\nArea based upon initial area location using the scaled grid. The aircraft photographic I2S resolution is about one foot.\nan accuracy of about \xc2\xb1 10%.\n\nThe optical in situ measurements have\n\nThe photometric resolution of the I S imagery is\nabout 1% and the absolute accuracy is about 10% whereas, the photometric relative\nresolution of ERTS-1 MSS scanner, from NASA Data Users Handbook, is & 1 digital\nlevel equivalent to about 1. 5% based on the range of 63 levels.\niv\n\ne\n\nFor the Virgin Islands area Band 4 radiances ranged from quantum levels of\n20 to 30 for water to 80 to 90 for dry beach sand. To uniquely interpret the\ncomputer print out each character must designate a specific quantum value,\nnot 2 values -- one high and one low as in the present system.\n\n(As an alternative\n\nwe made a second print out which left blank all pixels in the high range; i. e.\nabove the 53 quantum level - total range of 127).\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nWe recommend our present program approach which, combines in situ optical,\nbiological and chemical monitoring with similar calibrated aircraft I2S and ERTS imagery\nto conduct the following:\n* Large scale surveys of Northern Industrial Coastal areas for establishment of\nlimits of utilization of ERTS-1 and aircraft for monitoring water quality in areas\nmuch more turbid than Carribean waters; in many areas certain industrial wastes\ndarken the water, which effect is opposite to the brightening of St. Thomas harbor\nwaters due to domestic wastes.\n* Investigation of visible sea bottom bathymetry.\nFor future programs we suggest improvement in the following areas:\n-\n\nAdapt rigid specifications to control the Kodak Versamat during processing\nof the film and prints; i. e.,\n\nstability of illuminating lamp, constancy of\n\ndeveloper strength and uniformity of contact pressure of negative on print\nduring exposure.\n-\n\nConduct, on location, the biological and chemical measurements and\nanalysis of water samples\n\n-\n\nMore detailed in situ optical measurements to establish the water\nspectral characteristics of the area of interest\n\n-\n\nOperable internal calibration of ERTS sensors\n\n-\n\nMore digital radiance levels in high gain mode; i. e., increased relative\nresolution for darker areas, (water)\n\n-\n\nIncrease spectral resolution to detect discrete water characteristics; i. e.,\nchlorophyll 645 and 665 nanometer bands, carotenoids 480 and 510 nanometer\nbands and others as appropriate.\n\nV\n\n-\n\nIncorporate capability to insert, by ground command, the filters required\nto obtain radiance data in specific spectral bands selected for the particular\nwater or other target characteristics anticipated.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nThermal sensing capability would be desirable for detecting different water\nmasses based on temperature differences.\n\n-\n\nvi\n\nPolarimetric capability should be incorporated in future ERTS sensor to\nincrease the optical information acquisition in each spectral band.\n\nFor coastal zone application retain MSS Band 7 for land water interface\nboundary determination.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\n\nSection\nI\n\nSUMMARY OF ERTS-1 VIRGIN ISLANDS EXPERIMENT #589 ..........\n1-1\n\n1.0\n\nIntroduction ....................\n\n1.1\n\nDescription of the Test Site ............................\n\n1-1\n\n1.2\n\nOperational Plan ...................................\n\n1-2\n\n1.3\n\nData Acquisition ..................................\n\n1-6\n\n.........\n\n..\n\n..................\n\n1-6\n\n1.3.1\n1.3.2\n\nAircraft Data .................................\n\n1-6\n\n1. 3. 3\n\nOptical Photometric Data ........................\n\n1-10\n\n1.3.4\n\nBiological, Chemical and Physical Water Quality Data....\n\n1-10\n\n1.3.5\n\nCurrent Meters ....................................\n\n1-15\n\n1.3.6\n1.4\n\nSpacecraft Data ................\n\nRhodamine Dye Release.........................\n\n.\n\n1-15\n1-21\n\nData Processing .....................................\n1.4.1\n\nSummary of Data Products. . ..........\n\n1.4.2\n\nGeographical Location of Bulk CCT Computer\n\n..........\n\n.\n\n1-21\n\nPrint-Out Pixels ..............................\n\n1-21\n\n1.4. 3\n\nCloud and Cloud Shadow Boundaries. ... ..............\n\n1-22\n\n1.4.4\n\nEffect of MSS Response Time Characteristics ...........\n\n1-22\n\n1.4.5\n\nCalibration Test Site, Brewer\'s Bay Beach - Location\nand Registration Between Bands of ERTS-1 MSS Data.....\n\n1.5\n\n1-22\n\nData Analysis and Correlation ..........................\n\n1-31\n\n1.5.1\n\nOptical Measurements and Correlation ..............\n\n1-31\n\n1.5.2\n\nHarbor Biological, Chemical and Physical Data\nAnalysis and Correlation........................\n\n1.6\n\nDiscussion of Appendices ..............................\n\n1-32\n1-36\n\nvii\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS (Continued)\nSection\nII\n\nPage\nCORRELATION OF ERTS-1 AND AIRCRAFT OPTICAL DATA WITH\nWATER QUALITY PARAMETERS OF CHARLOTTE AMALIE HARBOR,\nST.

G. Egan, Research Department, Grumman Aerospace\nCorporation describes the procedures used in the acquisition analysis and correlation of\nsatellite, aircraft, surface and in situ optical data. The format of this section is that of an\nindependent report in order to maintain the integrity of authorship.\nSection III prepared by D.A. Olsen of Marine Resources Development Foundation\ndescribes the water quality parameters of the test site, the biological, chemical and physical\nwater data acquisition program, and initial correlation of these data. The format of this\nsection is also that of an independent report in order to maintain integrity of authorship.\nSection IV, Data Processing prepared by Mr. G. Heaslip, Grumman Data Systems\nCorporation, describes the procedures used to log the data, the format of the data bank,\nvarious data presentation methods, procedure for geographically locating pixel elements of\nCCT bulk print outs, and computation by computer of correlation matrices and rotated\nfactor analyses.\n\nGrumman Data Systems Corporation accomplished the computer operations\n\non the data and supplied correlation matrices and factor analysis results used by Dr. Egan\nin Section II.\n1.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE TEST SITE\nThe St. Thomas harbors as a water quality test site are unique in that they provide\nnearly laboratory conditions on a macro scale.\n\nWithin a small area of three miles by seven\n\nOriginal photography may beau[\n\nEROS Data Center\n10th and, Dakota Avenue\nSioux Falls, SQ 5719\n\nmiles are found three distinct types of polluting effluents, so separated that their dispersion\nplumes are virtually independent of each other. With reference to the chart Figure 1-1:\n* Raw sewage effluent: a peak of 3 x 106 gallons per day flows into Charlotte\nAmalie Harbor. Major outfalls are located at Long Bay near West Indian\ndock, Kings Wharf, Charlotte Amalie, and at the juncture of East and West\nGrecerie channels.\n\nOrganic discharge of 154, 000 gallons per day peak\nfrom a black strap molasses plant also occurs.\n* Combined desalinization/power plant discharge into Lindbergh Bay:\n- Coolant water, 21, 000 gallons per minute at 380C\n- Brine, 2, 000 gallons per minute at 70 parts per thousand\n* Solid waste ocean dump and fill off the western tip of Truman Airport\nTo the south of the harbor entrances the island platform slopes from 60 feet to\n150 feet in a distance of about 7 miles. It then drops abruptly to deep ocean, several\nthousand feet.\n\nThe normal set of the ocean current is from the S.E. to N.W., thus providing a source of ocean water which slowly flushes the harbors. Tides generally vary from\ndiurnal to semi-diurnal over a lunar period with a height range of 6 inches to 12 inches. On\nOctober 17, 1972, the predicted tidal range was 6 1/2 inches, peak current recorded was\n0. 5 kts, and average current speed of all readings of all current meter stations for the\n24 hour period was 0. 14 kts. Water mass movement is quite slow for these harbors.\n1.2 OPERATIONAL PLAN\nThe program operational plan included acquisition of aircraft multiband photography,\noptical measurements on the ground of calibration test panels and coral sand, optical in situ\nmeasurements of the water, and biological, chemical and physical data of the harbor water.\nThe aircraft photography and ground optical data facilitated correlation of ERTS-1 data with\nwater in situ data and established the limits of utility of the aircraft data. The steps followed in data acquisition, analysis and in determining the degree of correlation are set forth\nin the Flow Diagram, Figure 1-2, which was formulated by Dr. W. G. Egan. The following\nexplanatory notes refer to the operations listed on Figure 1-2:\n* Measurements of the sun on the ground enabled determination of the amount\nof atmospheric attenuation and scattering that occurs between the satellite\nand the ground at the solar elevation in blue, green and red spectral bands.\n\n1-2\n\n*:\n\n-\n\n--\n\n-T\n\nBREWER\'S BAY BEACH\n_~~/; "~-~\nTEST SITE\nL,:\nXi ,\n:\n\n< .........\n\nSTORM RUN-OFF\n\n=---\n\n,,\n\nLAUNDRY"\n\n,\n\n-lJ\nSEWAGE\n\n.RAW\n\nd\n\n.J\n\n"\n\n-\n\n2.0 MGD\n\n"~ -aP\n\nSTORM &DOMESTIC\nSEWER 0.3 MGD\n!ik "\n,\n\nK\n\n8 rj\n\nTHERMAL\nHIGH SALINITY\n\n. ..\n\nS\n\n,,\n\n.L\' K\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-\n\no"\n\no\n\nano\n\n4;\n\n10-\n\n"\n\n93\n\na\n\n-\n\nNIS\n\no ..\n\na\n\nvOa,.R\n\n-...\n\n.\n\n~o .\n...\n\n- .....\n\n589\n\nJAN 1973\n\n_0"\n\nT\n\no\n\noN"ow\n\n-\n\nMMC\n\nO*\n\n~~\n\n~\n\nET\n\nI\n\n-e:-e\nFEET\nSOUNDINGS IN U~;1~\n\nigue 1-1.

B. Heaslip, Grumman Data System Corp.\n\nThe objective\n\n1-5\n\nwas to maximize the use of computers in both the presentation and analysis\nof the data.\n1.3 DATA ACQUISITION\n1.3. 1 Spacecraft Data\nERTS-1 MSS data were acquired on October 17, 1972, scene #1086-14162 at\n1016 a.m. local time.\n\nFigure 1-3 includes 9X enlargements of the 70 mm black and white\n\nimagery of the 4 MSS bands, 3X enlargement of the 9" x 9" color composite, and the original\n70 mm MSS Band 5 scene. The acquisition of in situ data was tightly scheduled in order to\nmatch the time of the satellite passage as closely as possible.\n\nFigure 1-4 shows the\n\nchronology of data acquisition for October 17, 1972.\nThe harbor water data acquisition program extended over three satellite passes,\nOctober 10th to November 22nd, in order to improve chances of obtaining cloud free ERTS-1\ndata of the test site coincoident with in situ data.\nper month with cloud cover less than 0.3).\n\n(Historical weather data showed five days\n\nERTS-1 data of St. Thomas were not acquired\n\non the preceding pass September 29th nor the two subsequent passes November 4th and 22nd.\n1.3.2 Aircraft Data\nAircraft photography and thermal imagery were obtained in order to locate variances\nin color, turbidity, temperature, bottom features, etc. which should be detectable by the\nERTS-1 satellite.\n\n(We understand the MSS might include a thermal band for subsequent\n\nERTS spacecraft.)\n\nThese data were acquired by a Kennedy Space Center/NASA team under\n\nthe direction of Messrs. R. Withrow and J. O\'Conner. Kennedy Space Center supplied the\naircraft and remote sensing crew. Grumman Ecosystems supplied an IZS camera, the\nDaedalus line scanner, and also designed and fabricated the bracketry required to install the\nDaedalus thermal line scanner into the aircraft, NASA 6. Maximum cooperation existed\nbetween KSC and Grumman personnel, which enabled acquisition of the remotely sensed\naircraft data in a very efficient manner. The aircraft flew approximately 15 hours on\nstation, collecting about 350 line miles of photography and a lesser amount of thermal IR\nimagery of particular sites. (This does not include flight time to and from Roosevelt Roads\nNaval Air Station for refueling and supplies.)\nFour missions were scheduled to record conditions under four tidal phases; i. e.,\nhigh tide slack water, ebb tide, low tide slack water and flood tide. The I2S Multiband\ncamera recorded in the following spectral bands Blue . 410 , . 470, Green .475 - . 580,\nRed .590 - .690, Near IR . 740 - .900 micrometers.

A thermal run at 2000 feet was also\nmade over Lindbergh Bay. The aircraft then climbed to 6000 feet altitude and flew the harbor\nflight lines operating both the multiband camera and the thermal line scanner. At completion\nof the 6000 feet altitude runs the aircraft again passed over the optical targets at 2000 feet to\nacquire calibration data. Kennedy Space Center in collaboration with Manned Space Center\nand Dr. Egan of Grumman processed the photography and supplied working positive transparencies to Grumman. Refer to Figures 1-5 and 1-6 for chart depicting flight lines.\n1. 3. 3 Optical Photometric Data\nPhotometric measurements on the ground and in the harbor were acquired by\nDr. W. G. Egan during ERTS-1 passage October 17, 1972 and as closely coincident thereto as\nwas possible. These measurements involved: (1) In situ measurements of the harbor water\nat 7 optical stations located along the harbor transect line between biological stations 102 and\n120, (2) Spectral reflectance measurements of color test panels on the ground and the coral\nbeach sand at Brewer\'s Bay Beach, for use as a calibration standard for ERTS-1 and aircraft\ndata.\n\nRefer to Figure 1-1 for location of the transect stations and Brewer\'s Bay Beach,\nnorth of the airport. Refer to Section II, page 2-2 and subsequent for detail discussion.\n1. 3.4 Biological, Chemical and Physical Water Quality Data\nBiological, chemical and physical water quality data were obtained under the direction of Dr. David A. Olsen. A total of 95 stations were located about the harbor in order to\nbracket the water conditions. Weekly repetitive sampling was accomplished at seventeen\n(17) stations to obtain information on the variability of the water conditions. Current meters\nwere also located at these 17 repetitive stations. Fort-four (44) stations were located in\norder to provide a geographical spread of data. These stations were sampled only once\nduring the six-week program. Twenty-two stations were located along the transect\nextending from the inner harbor docks out the shipping channel a distance of approximately\ntwo miles. In situ optical data were acquired by Dr. Egan along this transect. Also,\nDr, Olsen acquired pigment samples along the transect and also from 12 additional stations\nlocated to provide a geographical spread of pigment data. Diurnal variation in water quality\nparameters was studied at two stations (9 and 12) of the repetitive program.\nData were collected at the surface mid-depth and bottom.

National Ocean Surveys, NOAA) gave a maximum tidal range of\nabout 1 foot, although during our period of data acquisition the predicted tidal range was less\nthan 7 inches.\n\nThe wind was usually from the East or Southeast with a gentle force of about\n\n6. 0 mph, see Figure 1-11.\n\nPartial reduction of the current meter and wind data substan-\n\ntiated our visual observations that the harbor waters are quite sluggish, and also that comparing data acquired on different dates during similar tidal phases was a reasonable\nprocedure.\n1. 3. 6 Rhodamine Dye Release\nRhodamine dye was released in Lindbergh Bay beginning at 0830, October 17, 1972\n(1 hr. 45 min. prior to ERTS-1 pass).\n\nThe dye plume was clearly defined on the I 2 S\n\nphotography which was acquired shortly after ERTS-1 pass at 1016.\n\nThe plume covered\n\nan area about 300 feet in a north-south direction and 80 feet east-west direction.\n\nThis area\n\nequates to four ERTS-1 MSS computer print out pixels along the ERTS-1 flight path and\n1-1/2 pixels across the flight path.\non the ERTS-1 data print outs.\n\nThe area was too small to be identified with certainty\n\nUse of ERTS data, but not to the exclusion of aircraft\n\nimagery, is suggested for applications where large area studies are involved and ERTS\nsynoptic imagery would facilitate understanding water mass movements.\n\nOf course, this\n\napplication is not limited to recording dye plumes, but includes recording water masses\nwith distinguishable differences in turbidity.\n\n1-15\n\nSAINT\n\nTHOMAS\n\nHARBOR\n\n3",\n\n.--\n\n-\n\n.\n\nQ\n\n13\n\n1-\n\n0.\n\n8\n1s.\n\nO\n\no4\n\n4l\n\niO\n\nME\n\n6o\n\nST\n\nTARGET\n.

Heaslip,\nGrumman Data Systems Corporation.\n\nComputer print-out in four formats of all data by\n\nstations (refer to page 4-2) constitutes the expandable data bank which pertain to the status\nof the harbor waters of St. Thomas, as of the fall of 1972. This data bank should be useful\nas a baseline for future investigations.\n\nComputer base maps were designed where each com-\n\nputer line printer character represented a one-second latitude cell by one-second longitude\nwell as in situ\ncell, and provided a means of accurately displaying ERTS-1 precision data as\ndata.\n\nComputer maps were generated using scaled shaded circles, in lieu of numeric\n\nvalues, for use in first look analysis of data.\n\nLevel slicing of aircraft thermal IR data,\n\ntime-history charts, current meter plots, etc. were also provided.\n\nRefer to Section IV,\n\npage 4-3 and subsequent pages for detailed description of these data products.\n1.4.2 Geographical Location of Bulk CCT Computer Print-Out Pixels\nGoddard Space Flight Center/NASA supplied imagery of scene #1086-14162 all bands\nin 70 mm bulk black and white, 9 x 9 bulk black and white positive prints, 9 x 9 color composite (4, 5, 7), 9 x 9 precision black and white positive transparencies and both bulk and\nThe scale of the enlarged 9 x 9 imagery is approximately 1 to 1 million.\nThe problem of locating a sampling station on such imagery (Figure 1-3), within 80 meters\n(one CCT print-out pixel) is very difficult. This combined with loss in photometric and\nprecision CCTs.\n\nradiometric fidelity, spatial resolution and non linearities resulting from conversion of\ndigital data to imagery, dictated the necessity of working with the CCT data. We developed\na program for computer print-out of the precision CCT data pixels corresponding to each\nof the sampling stations. Preliminary evaluation of the precision print-out values indicated\nthe desirability of using the bulk CCT data tapes for their greater radiometric accuracy.\nA program was written to print out the bulk tapes and the geographical accuracy problem\n(location of the pixels on a harbor chart) was solved as follows: The direction of satellite\ntrack, approximately 1910 true, was plotted on a chart of the St. Thomas harbor. Prominent points of land-water boundaries on the chart were selected and located on the MSS Band\n7 print-out at a convenient distance apart both along track and across track. (Band 7 was\nbest for land-water delineation.)\n\nThe number of MSS scan lines between the two points for\n\nacross track and a second two points for along track compared with the distance measured\non the chart determined the scale of the scan lines and consequently the grid layout. The\ngrid overlay scan lines were numbered to match the corresponding computer CCT print outs.\n\n1-21\n\nEach pixel of Band 7 could then be accurately located on the chart to within the original\nland-water interface determination (instrumentation non linearities are assumed to be\nnegligible).\narea.\n\nWe believe this positional accuracy is within 1 pixel for the St. Thomas harbor\n\nRefer to Figure 1-12.\n\n1.4.3 Cloud and Cloud Shadow Boundaries\nThe chart overlay grid (Figure 1-12) was essential in accurately establishing boundaries of clouds and cloud shadows in the test area.\n\nWith reference to (Figure 1-13), ERTS-1\n\nMSS quantum values were contoured for highest pixel grouping (clouds) and lowest grouping\n(cloud shadows).\nprint out.\n\nFor confirmation the sun\'s azimuth was computed and laid on the computer\n\nSample stations 112 and 115 were also laid on the print out.\n\nwholly within the cloud shadow and115 partially within the shadow.\n\nStation 112 was\n\nAccordingly, in com-\n\nparing ERTS-1 data with in situ data we discarded ERTS-1 values for station 112 and 115\nand utilized closely adjacent data pixels which were free of the cloud influence.\n1.4.4 Effect of MSS Response Time Characteristics\nIn a similar manner the chart overlay grid was utilized to investigage ERTS-1 MSS\nquantum values for station 102.\n\nWith reference to Figure 1-14, the pixels corrpsponding\n\nto the concrete waterfront street and sea wall have high values (about 60), and about\n3 pixels are involved before the across track scan values fall to a level representative of the\nwater.\n\nThis delay is due to the response time characteristics of the ERTS-1 MSS scanner.\n\nAlso in this particular case by using the grid overlay we could eliminate those pixels which\nincluded the town dock and Coast Guard ship, and in lieu thereof use closely adjacent pixels\nwhich appeared to be more representative of the actual water characteristics of station 102.\n1.4.5 Calibration Test Site, Brewer\'s Bay Beach - Location and Registration Between\nBands of ERTS-1 MSS Data\nIn order to establish more accurately the geographical location of ERTS-1 Bulk CCT\nprint out pixels relative to the calibration test site, a grid overlay was made to match the\nscale of the aircraft . 2 S imagery, Figure 1-15 of the test site.\n\nFigures 1-16, 1-17, 1-18\n\nand 1-19 show the bulk CCT print out values superimposed on this grid overlay.\n\nGeograph-\n\nical location of the CCT print out by this method checked precisely, line to line, with the\norientation for the entire St. Thomas Harbor. The highest MSS quantum value for each band\noccurred at the same pixel location, across track line 1584 and along track line 846.\n\nThe\n\ngeographical location of this pixel was the coral sand parking lot at Brewer\'s Bay Beach\nwhere the color test panels were laid out. We therefore concluded that registration\n\n1-22\n\n(OU)\n\nAEJC7/-.-CGFF\n0\n\n-1575831580-\n\nIVSS BAND 7\n-//289A 89AAACCCEE BDF D5568GJJEF\n1CGFF\n-:--I!C\nIEJKC7/--------------178895FNM6-:------2FDE\n------ ::--15666FLLA:---.-..-/9HG\n:---:---::249FLKH3.-...---1AJP\n--------:-2GIKIH3.--..-.-/6CF\n....\n... 3GMIAO...........6\n-.-..\n.....4GL4.-........\n09\n\n1584--15831585\n\n1590-\n\n-.---.. ---.- /9M9\n.----....\n-4G6 ........\n....\n\n-,\n.6\n..- -:- LINE 1603 -\n\n.. .....\n\n-\n\n0\n\n..\n\n.\n\n1595-\n\n7\n\n"\'1600-- I\n\nS1605-,\n\n2FI G GHNL.--...-\n\n1101-.-c\n\nO\n\n:bIMJKJLL8.-.-.\n\n1DI\nILMIKLIE-\n\n--.-- 09GKMKHJKIJDO\n....- :06FHGIJKKCO.\n.. ... -OCJJKMMF2..\n\nV)1\n\n< 1610\n\n.\n\n-. 3EKLLC/-.\nSIFO.-..\n+ ......\n-2c4 ....-\n\n1610.......\n\nrr\n\nLINE 603\n\n11\n\no 1615-\xe2\x80\xa2.\ntL!\n1620\n1625\n1630-\n\n10\n\n16351640\n/l\n\n1\n\n855 860 865\n\n875\n\nFigure 1-12.\n\nl\n885\n\nl\n895\n\n1\n\n905\n\nl\n\nT\n\n7\n\nT\n\n/\n\n/\n\n915\n\n925\n\n935\n\n945\n\n955\n\n965\n\nERTS-1 MSS Bulk CCT Computer Print Out Grid of Scene 1086-14162.\n\nChart #933, St. Thomas, V.I.\n\n7\n975\n\n985\n\n995\n\nScaled to Match C & GS\n\n9\n3\n9\n\n9 9\n4 4\n0 1\n\n1594\n1595\n\nm\n\n26 2\n20 2\n\n1596\n\n2\n\n9\n4\n2\n\n1597\nz\n:, 1598\nzt 1599\n<z\n1600\n0uw 1601\n< E 1602\ncn 1603\nS1604\n\nO- 1605\n0\no 1606\n1607\n1608\n1609\n\n9\n4\n3\n\n?\n\n8\n\n9\n!\n5\n\n9\n4\n4\n\nERTS MSS BAND 4 - BULK CCT VALUES\'\nALONG TRACK SCAN LINES SCALE 234m.

The water varied\nfrom a polluted highly turbid condition at station 101, to quite clear at station 108 where the\nbottom is usually visible, to the very clear Caribbean waters offshore where the bottom is\nvisible to depths of 60 feet or more.\nIn situ water optical measurements made with a M-H Photometer were peaked at\n0.433, 0. 533 and 0. 633 nanometers. Data were taken at seven optical stations along the\ntransect, Table 2-1, page 2-5.\nSpectral reflectance characteristics of Brewer\'s Bay Beach coral sand were measured in the Grumman Optics Laboratory on samples returned from the test site. The color\ntest panels were also calibrated in the Laboratory. These calibration data are plotted as\nFigures 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5 and 2-6, pages 2-7 through 2-11. Radiance measurements\nwere recorded closely coincident with ERTS-1 and aircraft I S passes on October 17, 1972\non the white test panel in blue, green and red spectral bands, Table 2-2, page 2-12. Photometric measurements of the clear blue sky in a direction away from the sun were also made.\nThe calibration test panels laid out at Brewer\'s Bay Beach were measurable on the I2S\nphotography and the Brewer\'s Bay Beach coral sand was clearly detected on the ERTS MSS\nCCT print out; hence, the photometric measurements enabled calculation of radiance at the\nsurface for the aircraft I2S and ERTS-1 MSS data. Refer to Tables 2-4 and 2-5, page\n2-28,\n2-29.\nThe resultant radiance calculations for the seven optical stations on the harbor\ntransect are summarized in Table 1-2 and graphically presented in Figure 1-20 which can be\ncompared with Figure 1-21, Graphical Correlation of Turbidity, Chlorophyll, and\nCarotenoids along the Harbor Transect. As discussed by Dr. Egan on page 2-50 and\nDr. Olsen on page 3-19 use of computer generated correlation matrices is a useful technique\nto indicate the degree of correlation of the several variables.

Olsen in Section III of this report the harbor water quality\ninvestigation program was primarily centered around the acquisition of the plankton pigment\ndata for the times of ERTS overflight.\n\nThe three diurnal studies asscssed the hourly variation of plankton pigment and the relation between it and basic water quality parameters.\nThese studies showed a homogeneity between different times at the same locale, but short\nterm temporal variability was too great to permit valid statistical analysis between locales.\n\n1-32\n\n.25\n\n-\n\nDATA FROM TABLE:\n\n1\n\no\n\n-\n\n1 I\n14-\n\n- -\n\no\n\n130\nC .20-\n\nAIRCRAFT GREEN\no AIRCRAFT RED\n\n13\n.020\n\nIN-SITU GREEN\n@ IN-SITU RED\n\n-\n\n13 6&\n\nERTS BULK BAND4\nERTS BULK BAND 5\n\nE\nz\nz\n\no\n\n.15 -\n\n.015\n\nI-\n\n~w\nz\n\nI-\n\n\xe2\x82\xacAIRCRAFT\n\nS.010\nU-\n\nRED\n(.590 - .690 pM)\n\n.10\n\nIN SITU RED\na .633/CM\n\n.005\n\n.05 -\n\nAIRCRAFT GREEN\n.580 MM)\n\n-(.475-\n\nERTS BULK BAND4\n(CORRECTED FOR\nATTENUATION)\n\n"ATMOS.\nIN SITU GREEN\na.533/CM\n\nS\n\nERTS BULK BAND 5\n(CORRECTED FOR\nATMOSPHERIC ATTENUATION)\n\n\'1\n\nL\n\nM\n\n2\n\nFigure 1-20.\n\nr\n3\n\n0\n\no\nM\n4\n\n-\n\n-\n\n5\n\n-\n\n6\n\nro -,\n\nTRANSECT STATIONS\n7\n\nOPTICAL STATIONS\n\nComparison of ERTS-1, Bands 4 and 5, Aircraft Green and Red and In Situ\nHarbor Transect Optical Data\n\nTURBIDITY\n\n25 -\n\n2.5--\n\nTOTAL CHLOROPHYL\n\n\\\nI\n20\n\n2.0-\n\n2.0\n\n5\n,.\n\nMSPU\nF.T.U.\n\\\nITURBIDITY\n\n=\n\nMILLI SPECIAL PIGMENT UNITS\nFORMAZIN TURBIDITY UNITS\n=(EQUIVALENT TO J.T.U.

Data obtained at geographERTS-1.\n\nical sampling stations enabled assessment of the geographical extent or generality of the\ntrends observed at the repetitive stations. The benthic samples described communities that\nhave developed over a period of years in response to water conditions and are therefore\nThere is a growing body of evidence (Hutchinson,\n1969) indicating that community structure can be an indicator of environmental stress. In\nthis manner of sampling, time variables were assessed so that the periodic 18 day over"bio-indicators" of long term trends.\n\nflights of ERTS could be related to long term trends over broad geographical areas, and\nperhaps used to monitor such trends.\nThe results point up the complexity of the interrelations of the oceanographic-biological\nsystem in the Virgin Islands. Benthic diversity is used to delineate the long term responses\nby the biotic community to water quality degradation from pollutants. Turbidity correlates\nwith benthic diversity and ERTS-1 data; hence, offers promise of providing a key for\nmonitoring some aspects of water qdality.\n\nRefer to Section III, page 3-42 and subsequent\n\nfor discussion of data correlation.\n1.6 DISCUSSION OF APPENDICES\nAppendix 1, Water Quality Survey of the Virgin Islands by the EPA, Region II lists\nresults of analysis for heavy metals of sediment and water samples collected by Grumman.\nThis appendix is included in this report not only to acknowledge the interest of EPA but also\nto acquaint the reader with another source of water quality data pertinent to St. Thomas.\n\n1-36\n\nWater Quality Survey of Virgin Islands\n\nBy\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, Region II\nAppendix 1\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, conducted a water quality survey of\nthe Virgin Islands in November and December 1972.

The optical stations, 1 through 7, were\nfewer than those used for the marine biology, mainly because of the length of time required\nfor each in situ set of optical observations (location and measurement = 1/2 hour). There\nwas also a limited time for the entire optical transect, because it was made in the afternoon\nfollowing the 1016 HRS. ERTS-1 passage over St. Thomas Harbor on October 17, 1972,\nERTS-1 SCENE #1086 - 14162.\nA supplementary optical calibration area was situated at Brewers Bay Beach,\nlocated about 3 miles west of the optical study area.\nThe St. Thomas Harbor optical transect begins in a region of high pollution from\nsewage effluent (near the Coast Guard Dock) and terminates in a region of low pollution past\nMuhlenfels point (see Figure 2-1).\n\nRaw sewage was discharged into the harbor at a peak\nrate of about 3 million gallons per day (Ref. 2). Since there is no aquifer on the Island of\nSt. Thomas, drinking water is obtained from catch basins and a desalination plant.\nSanitary sewage (toilet waste) is flushed using bay water pumped inland through a separate\nwater system.\n\nThe raw sewage is presently discharged into the bay along the sea wall at\nthe northerly rim (Figure 2-1).\nThere are additional sources of sediment in the harbor water. One source is the\ndaily docking of cruise ships, generally at the West Indian Dock (east of the initial portion\nof the harbor optical transect, Figure 2-1). Another cause of sediment is a dredge\noperating along the harbor entrance channel, acquiring coral sand for building construction.\nAlso, the ships docked at the West Indian pier discharge raw sewage, as well as do\nsmall craft docked nearby at the Yacht Haven Marina.\n2.2 OPTICAL CALIBRATION PROGRAM\nWhy do we need an optical calibration program? Why can\'t we simply use contrasts\nin color to determine pollution ?\nThese two rhetorical questions serve to introduce a section in this report which is\nunique in the present thinking on interpretation of ERTS-1 and aircraft imagery. There\nare techniques in use of contrast enhancement in imagery using false colors so that we\nmay\n2-2\n\nB4,kb\n.\n\n104\n\nJ\n\n..\n\n,\n\n6\n\nSTA. 2\n\n2,OPT.\n\n2\n\nS .PT 6\'\n1\n\ns 25"p\'"oo\n\n6106\n"o\n\n, STA.\n.,.OPT.\n\nI\n\n12\n\nc\n\n23\n\ng:\n\nD~\nId~\n\n.,\nOPT.\n\n,.,.5\n\n1\n\n,\n\n"\'\n\n26,\n\n\'ioO\n\n1s\n\nr\n\n\'\n\n.-,\n\n116\n\n12\n\nP\n\n52\n\nII*\n\n5\n\nur 1. brA. 5~\nOPT.\n\n26\n\n13,,\n\n3\n\n29\n"\n\nZ\n\n,\n\n.\n\n15k\n\nC.-IcwrLIT\n\n14\n\nT\n\ne\n\nTASTA.\n2\n\nRRII\n\n*4\n\n316\n\nOPT.

Court\ncases may be based on visual evidences of pollution, but the final decision always rests with\nthe exact degree, with well defined specification; an image of water with discoloration does\nnot quantitatively yield information on degree of pollution or even the nature. There must\nbe optical calibration, and this calibration must include spectral (color) effects.\nReference 3 pointed up the need for color calibration and control in true false color\nphotography; this is more difficult with color film than with panchromatic black and white\nfilm because of interlayer effects in color film.\n\nTherefore the preferred approach for\n\naircraft imagery is the use of a 4 lens camera with selective color filtration (such as the\nI2S), with automated film processing (as with the Kidak Versimat).\nSatellite imagery (ERTS-1) suffers from the absolute calibration problem, with\ncomplicating factors resulting from atmospheric scattering and absorption combined with\neffects of reduced spatial resolution.\n\nAbsolute calibration becomes necessary for ERTS-1\n\nimagery to quantify color levels absolutely and to determine the effects of atmospheric\nscattering and absorption.\nThe implementation of the optical calibration program involves four aspects:\n(1) In situ harbor water transect measurements, (2) Brewers Bay Beach and Color Panel\nCalibration, (3) Calibration of the I2S photographic imagery, and (4) Calibration of the\nERTS-1 data.\n\nThese four aspects will now be described.\n\n2.2.1 In Situ Harbor Water Measurements\nThe optical property of the harbor water that will be sensed will be its brightness.\nThe brightness is the result of many factors which include scattering of particulates in the\nwater, sun elevation, and waves which may reflect as sun glint along with the sky reflection.\n\nWhere the water surface waves are small, and the sun glint does not significantly\n\naffect the water surface brightness, the brightness of the water will depend upon the light\nthat is backscattered by macroscopic, microscopic, and submicroscopic particulates in the\nwater.\n\nIf the water is relatively uncolored by dissolved constituents, the transmission of\n\nlight in the water is a good indicator of the concentration of scattering particles.\nscattering particles there are in the water, the lower will be the transmission.\nthis is only an approximation.\n\nHowever,\n\nFurther, the transmission will generally depend upon the\n\nwavelength of the light used in the transmission measurement.\n\n2-4\n\nThe more\n\nThe water optical transmission measurements for this program were made using a\nportable battery operated Minneapolis-Honeywell photometer (with interchangeable narrowband interference filters) mounted on a submarine viewing tube. The submarine tube had a\nwater-tight plexiglass window that permitted photometric measurements under water without\ninterference from surface waves. The optical filters used in the measurements were\npeaked at 0.433, 0.533 and 0.633 p m; they were Optics Technology narrow band interference filters with a bandpass of 0. 02 p m. These measurements for the 7 optical stations\nare presented in Table 2-1; the location of the optical stations relative to the biological\ntransect station is indicated in the second column. Where two biological stations are\nindicated, the optical station is located about midway between them. The quantities listed\nin Table 2-1 are in units of cm- 1 , as defined by the relation\n-ad\nI=I 0\nwhere:\nI o = Intensity of incident (sun) light\'\nI = Intensity of transmitted (sun) light\na = the absorption coefficient\nd = path distance in centimeters.\nIt is to be noted that at optical stations 1, 2 and 3, the concentration of particulates was so\ngreat that a short path length had to be used, and the measurements have a lower accuracy\n(130%) than the other stations which have a photometric accuracy of \xc2\xb13 to 5%.\nThe absorption coefficients are listed in Table 2-1 for the ground truth transect\nwhich is used subsequently in this report.\nTable 2-1.\n\nOptical Data on St. Thomas Harbor Transect on 10/17/72\n\nOPTICAL\nSTATION\n\nTRANSECT\nSTATION\n\n*\na.433/cm\n\n1\n\n102\n\n.019\n\n.014\n\n.019\n\n2\n\n104\n\n.019\n\n.014\n\n.019\n\n3\n\n106-107\n\n.019\n\n.014\n\n.019\n\n4\n\n109-110\n\n.0033\n\n.0044\n\n.0066\n\n5\n\n112\n\n.0018\n\n.0030\n\n.0052\n\n6\n\n115\n\n.0014\n\n.0019\n\n.0047\n\n7\n\n119-120\n\n.0008\n\n.0019\n\n.0041\n\na.533/cm\n\na.633/cm\n\n* Half Bandwidth of Filters = 20 nanometers.\n\n2-5\n\n2.2.2 Brewers Bay Beach and Color Panel Calibration\nThe spectral reflectance of the coral beach sand used as a calibration standard for\nthe ERTS-1 and the aircraft imagery at 6000 feet altitude is presented in Figure 2-2 under\nillumination conditions closely analogous to those existing during the ERTS-1 overpass.\nThe sand in the central area is brighter because it is finer, more firmly packed and free of\nlarger shells that exist in the sand near the water.\n\nHowever the reflectance from the sand\n\nalso depends upon the viewing angle and wavelength of the incident light; this is shown in\nFigure 2-3 (the phase angle on the abscissa is the sum of the incident angle of 400 and a\nvariable viewing angle).\n\nThe reason that the spectral reflectance (Figure 2-2) must be\n\nknown is so that one can use any apparent spectral variation observed from the ERTS-1 or\nfrom high altitude photography to determine the amount of atmospheric filtration and\nscattering.\n\nThe angular dependence (Figure 2-3) is used to determine the vignetting of the\n\nphotographic lens and filter system on a selected photographic image where the Brewers\nBay Beach area extends completely across the frame.\nThe spectral reflectance of the test panels on Brewers Bay Beach (Figure 2-4) used\nfor low altitude (2000 ft) aircraft imagery is presented in Figure 2-5. The white (W) and\ngray panels (G1, G2, and G3) have reasonably uniform reflectance between 0.4 and 1.0\npm,\nbut drop rapidly below 0.4 pm. The red (R) is almost saturated, but the blue (B) and\ngreen (G) are weaker in saturation; the important consideration is that the paints be "flat"\n(i. e. have uniform reflectance at all viewing angles in order not to introduce additional\ncorrections).\n\nThe actual "flatness" of the reflectance is shown in Figure 2-6, which\n\nreveals small changes in reflectance between phase angles of 20 and 1100. At phase angles\nbelow 200, the pronounced increase in reflectance is characteristic of nearly all materials,\nand is generally much stronger.\nThe reason for using 7 test panels is that they serve as an additional check on the\nfilm response in low altitude aircraft imagery, and as a cross calibration check on the sand\nphotometry.

This curve is representative of the other interference filters. It is seen that the\ntransmission at normal incidence is shifted toward shorter wavelengths at 190 incidence\nangle.\n\nThis is important because the extreme rays incident through the camera lens enter\n\nthe filter (which is placed in front of the lens) at an angle of 27. 60 to normal, increasing\nthis effect. This can then affect the bandpass of the combination of Wratten filter and interference filter so as to narrow or expand the bandpass, and thus the response of the photographic system will be angularly dependent.\nHowever, inherent in the imaging process of a lens is a cos 3 dependence on incident\nangle. This is in addition to the angular dependence on the filter transmission properties\nThis cos 3 dependence is quite pronounced and produces a vignetting of the\nAnti-vignetting filters are sometimes employed to minimize this vignetting effect,\n\njust mentioned.\nimage.\n\nbut they slow down the effective speed of the imaging system. It is also to be noted that the\nvignetting effect shown in Figure 2-8b is aperture dependent; smaller f stops result in less\nvignetting. Ultimately the brightness distribution in the film plane must be checked experimentally against imagery having a known brightness distribution. This can be accomplished in the laboratory or in the field; one approach is to photograph a beach area (such\nas Brewers Bay Beach, St. Thomas) so as to cover an entire frame. Then the brightness\nvariation in the photographic image can be used to calibrate the vignetting effect of the lens.\nAlso, there may be differences between the lenses, and the use of a curve such as Figure\n2-8b on one lens would not take these differences into account.\nFilm sensitivity: The spectral response of the type 2424 film is shown in Figure 2-10.\nHowever, this does not reveal the density as a function of exposure. This requires a particular calibration program. Such a calibration program was carried out through the cooperation of Kennedy Space Center/NASA and Manned Space Center/NASA for the present\ninvestigation.\n2-16\n\n.700\n\nRESPONSE OF TYPE 24-24 FILM\n28500 SOURCE\nCORRECTED TO 55000 K\n\n600-\n\n500\nz\no\nw\n\n-\n\n4001\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\nXnm\n\nFigure 2-10.\n\nSpectral Response of Type 2424 film.\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\nEssentially, the original undeveloped, exposed negative type 2424 film was sent to\nthe Phototechnology Division, Houston.\nCorning C5900 and C2043 filters.\n\nThere the film was exposed to a 28500 K lamp using\n\nThe exposures are tabulated in Table 2-3.\n\nUsing the\n\nexposure information given in Table 2-3, the camera system response may be computed;\nthese data are presented in the last column of Table 2-3.\n\nThe exposures listed in Table 2-3\n\nhave produced densities in the type 2424 negative film from a calibrated step tablet; this\ncalibrated step tablet was exposed on the type 2424 negative film through the three filters.\nBy plotting the measured densities on the negative against the original step tablet calibrated\ndensity, an H-D curve is obtained for 3 colors for the 2424 negative film.\nTable 2-3.

It is seen that the Macbeth reads lower densities\nthan the Joyce-Loebl, and that the relation is non-linear. The differences are the result of\ndifferences in the optical systems of the two units; if a non-scattering absorber were compared in the two densitometers, the readings would be the same. Because of scattering,\nsome of the light is not sensed by the Joyce-Loebl optical system and this leads to the\nhigher density readings on it. This does not lead to any problems as long as one densitometer\nis used consistently for a set of readings.\nThe H-D curves for red, green, and blue on the type 2424 negative film are presented\nin Figures 2-12, 2-13 and 2-14. The exposure is the reading on the Macbeth densitometer,\nand the density is read on the Joyce-Loebl microdensitometer with an effective aperture of\n\n2-18\n\n4.0 -\n\n3.8\n3.6\n3.4\n3.2\n3.0\nI-\n\n- 2.80 2.6-\n\nLINEAR\n\n>2.4-\n\nz\n..\n\nS2.2\nU\n\n2.0\n\nMEASURED\n\nO 1.8\nw 1.6 1.4\n1.2\n1.0.8\n.6.4.20\n\n.3\n\n.6\n\n.9\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\n1.8\n\n2.1\n\n2.4\n\n2.7\n\n3.0\n\nKENNEDY MACBETH NEGATIVE DENSITY\n\nFigure 2-11.\n\nMacbeth to Joyce - Loebl Densitometer Conversion\n\n2-19\n\n4.0\n\n3.8\n3.6\n3.4\n3.2\n3.0\n2.8\nz\n\nLu\n\n2.6\n\na\n\n>\n\n2.4\n2.2\n\nz\nLi\n\n2.0-\n\no\n\n,\n\n1.8\n\nI\n.\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n.8\n.6\n.4\n.2\n\n0\n\n.3\n\n.6\n\n.9\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\n1.8\n\n2.1\n\n2.4\n\n2.7\n\n3.0\n\nHOUSTON MACBETH: POSITIVE WEDGE DENSITY\n\nFigure 2-12.\n\n2-20\n\nRed Response of Type 2424 film; Macbeth vs Joyce-Loebl (with No. 25 and\nIR Filters)\n\n4.0 -\n\n3.8\n3.6\n3.4\n3.2\n3.0\n2.8 I-\n\n2.6\nw\n2.4\n<\n\n2.2\n\n-J\nW\n\n1.8\n\n0\n\n0\nO\n\n1.6 C-\n\n0\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n.8\n\n.6\n.4\n.2\n\n0\n\n.3\n\n.6\n\n.9\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\n1.8\n\n2.1\n\n2.4\n\n2.7\n\n3.0\n\nHOUSTON MACBETH POSITIVE WEDGE DENSITY\n\nFigure 2-13.\n\nGreen Response of Type 2424 film; Macbeth vs Joyce - Loebl (with No.\n\n57A\n\nand IR filters)\n\n2-21\n\n4.0\n\n3.8\n3.6\n3.4\n3.2\n3.0 2.8\n2.6\nz\nIL\nS\n\n2.4 -\n\nF\n\n2.2\n\nz\n\n2.0\n\nm\n\n1.8\n\n0\n\n-J,\n\nI\n\n1.6\n\nO\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n.8\n.6\n.4\n.2\n\n0\n\n.3\n\n.6\n\n.9\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\n1.8\n\n2.1\n\n2.4\n\n2.7\n\n3.0\n\nHOUSTON MACBETH POSITIVE WEDGE DENSITY\n\nFigure 2-14.\n\n2-22\n\nBlue Response of Type 2424 film; Macbeth vs Joyce-Loebl\n(with No. 47B\nand IR Filters)\n\n150pi.\n\nThis aperture was large enough to average over the photographic emulsion grains.\n\nIt is to be noted that the images of the original step wedge were not constant in density\nvariation, but increased slightly in density (due to scattering) toward the less dense end of\nthe wedge.\nThe type 2424 negative was then used by NASA, Kennedy to make a duplicate positive\nprint.\n\nBy printing one of the step wedge images from the type 2424 film (No. 25 filter one)\n\non the duplicate positive, the H-D curve for the duplicate positive is obtained (Figure 2-15).\nThere are two curves shown in Figure 2-15, one for the head and tail of a duplicate positive\nroll prepared in June 1973, and those of another duplicate positive prepared in July 1973 of\nFrame 0004 containing the test panels. The second duplicate positive was necessitated by\ninferior resolution in the duplicate positive Frame 0004 of the red and green I2S bands.\nBecause of processing variations, the positive densities may vary by as much as 0.2D\n(Joyce-Loebl) for the same exposure. This is one of the limitations of photograhic\nphotometry.\nThe method of use of the sensitometry curves (Figures 2-12 through 2-15) is as\nfollows: first a density is measured with the Joyce-Loebl microdensitometer on the\nduplicate positive of an area of interest.\n\nThis density of the positive on the ordinate of\n\nFigure 2-15 yields the type 2424 negative density, as read on the Joyce-Loebl for the black\nand white image of the red, green or blue bands. Then using either Figure 2-12, 2-13,\nor 2-14 depending upon whether the red, green, or blue original image was the one of\ninterest that was measured, we determine what was the required Macbeth exposure. Then\nusing this Macbeth exposure (density), and the values listed in Table 3 (Last column), the\nradiance may be calculated. This procedure will be followed in the section on Data Analysis.\n2.2.4 Calibration of the ERTS-1 Data\nThe IN ORBIT calibration of the ERTS-1 MSS scanner is inoperable because the calibration pulse has dropped considerably and appears to have shifted. Therefore we must depend on ground truth measurements for calibration.\n\nHowever the relative radiance levels\n\nfrom the ERTS-1 are still valid.\nSince ground truth was obtained only in the green and red bands, the discussion will\nbe limited to the corresponding ERTS-1 bands 4 and 5.\nThe calibration area of Brewers Bay Beach is shown in the I2S Blue Band Photograph\n(Figure 2-16).

There\nis the possibility of some error being introduced by this procedure.\nIn order to convert the digital levels on Figures 2-17a and 2-17b to the true radiance\nof the Brewers Bay Beach sand, the atmospheric scattering and attenuation must\nbe taken\ninto account. These atmospheric corrections are listed in Table 2-4 for ERTS-1\nBands 4\nand 5. The clear atmospheric attenuation (from Ref. 6) is listed in the second\ncolumn, and\nthe atmospheric scattered radiance in the third column.

The Band 5 imagery was unusable because of horizontal\nstriations caused by\nnon-uniform gain in the ERTS-1 sensor channels. There were\nalso displacements of some\nlines horizontally. Band 4 posed problems as to the location\nof the shore lines, as fiducial\npoints, to initiate microdensitometric scans. The 12 S viewer\nwas used to superimpose the\nimagery, and some photographs were made; however for\nquantitative work, the processed\nbulk tapes proved to be the most suitable.\n\n2-28\n\nTable 2-5.\n\n1\n\nBrewer\'s Bay Beach Radiances from ERTS-1 Data for Bands 4 and 5\n\n2\n\n3\n\nGSFC\nCALIBR\nTABLE\n(VOLT.

An improved remake of that frame was accomplished in July 1973 on the\nKodak Versamat #11 CM, (Developer VER 641).\n\nThe red and green bands of the remake\n\nlacked resolution for the test panels; this can be seen by referring to Figures 2-21 and 2-22,\nwhich are microdensitometric traces of the test panels on Brewers Bay Beach in the blue\nand red bands.\n\nThe effective microdensitometer aperture is 91p.\n\n(This aperture size was\n\ndetermined experimentally to be sufficiently large to average out over enough grains in the\nprint to yield useful densitometry values.) Figure 2-21 clearly reveals the test panel densitometry in the sharp blue print; even the center junction in the 6 foot panel array is revealed.\n\nHowever in the red band (Figure 2-22) it was difficult to resolve the panels, much\n\nless the density values.\nThe more dense direction in Figures 2-21 and 2-22 is toward the right, and each\nmajor division is equivalent to 0. 082D.\nUsing the density levels indicated in Frame 0004 taken at a 2000 ft altitude and the\nprocedure outlined in Table 2-6, we obtain the radiances for the test panels and Brewers\nBay Beach sand (Table 2-7).\n\nAlso listed in Table 2-7 are the photographically determined\n\nradiances at a 6000 foot altitude of the Brewers Bay Beach sand at the panel location on the\nbeach parking lot, and also along the beach area both at 0945 hrs. (Frame 0036), and at\n1430 hrs. (Frame 178).\n\nIt is seen that both the red and green radiances decrease with\n\naltitude change from 2000 to 6000 feet, but the blue only increases slightly indicating the\ndominant effect of atmospheric scattering in the blue.\n\nThe sand near the water is slightly\n\ndarker than the parking lot at 0945 hrs, but the illumination level increases at 1430 hours\nfor a 6000 foot altitude.\n2.3.3 Comparison Of Radiance Measurements, Ground, Aircraft I2S and ERTS-1\nA comparison of the radiance measurements, by the various techniques, of the\nBrewers Bay Beach sand in the parking lot is presented in Table 2-8. Agreement is\nexcellent except for the ERTS-1 green band.\n\nThe most probably source of error is that\n\nthe green atmospheric scattering correction for the ERTS-1 should be greater than that\nused in Table 2-4. This is evident from the fact that at 2000 foot altitude the photographic\ngreen photometric level is greater than at ground level (Table 2-8).\n2.3.4 Observed Color Temperature Effects\nAnother item of atmospheric information may be obtained from the white test panel\ncalibrations: the color temperature of the sun. During aerial photography, the apparent\ncolor temperature of the sun will change as a result of atmospheric filtration.

On the duplicate positive received in June 1973 the cross frame Macbeth\ndensity variability was 0. 03D, and the head to tail 0. 05D.\n\nThis was an improvement from\n\n0. 04D cross frame variability in the Nov. 72 print, but a deterioration of the head to tail\nvariability above 0. 04D. Some of this variability is in the original negative, being 0. 01D\ncross frame and 0. 03D head to tail. All the previous measurements were made with a\nMacbeth TD102 densitometer which has a published variability of \xc2\xb1 0. 02D; by careful\nchecking of the zero of the instrument, this has been reduced.\n\n2-39\n\n200000 250000 300000\n\n000"~~\n\nTHE ENERGY DISTRIBUTION EX ON A\nLOGARITHMIC SCALE.\nABSCISSAE:\nLOG X, CM.\n3\nLOG 2EX, WATT/CM\nORDINATES:\nACTUAL WAVE LENGTHS IN i ARE\nGIVEN BY BOTTOM SCALE\n\n0\n\nS\n\n0\n\n400\n00\n\n100000\n\n2-400\n\n404 000\n0\n\n010000\n\n1,41990\n\nIN\n\n0\n\n2\n\nab\n\n100\n\n400\n\n-5\nT\n\n01\n\ns\n\nes\n\n- 4\nless1,,\n\ni,,h ,\n\n02\n\ni.IIIs..a...t\n..\n\nI.h1\n\n1\n\n.\n\n. ..\n\n03 04 0506 08 1\n\nFigure 2-23.\n\n2-40\n\n8/ I/\nII I\n\nl IIIlll\n\n7\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n-3\nI .....\n\nl....I....I\n\n2\n\n3\n\n.\n\nIII\n\n1\n\nI.\n\nI.

the density level of the red reflectance of the larger numbered optical stations\nis of the order of 0.01D, which is less than the noise (the processing variations may amount\nto as much as 0.06D).\n\nBecause of the processing variations, the density observations for the\n\nSt. Thomas Harbor transect were referred to the maximum density rather than the clear\ntransmission.\nA graphical comparison of the bulk ERTS-1 Bands 4 and 5 data with photographic and\nin situ water observations is made in Figure 2-25, and the tabular data is presented in Table\n2-13.\n2.4.2 Effect of Clouds and Cloud Shadows\nThe ERTS-1 data in Table 2-13 and Figure 2-25 have been corrected for the effect of\na cloud shadow falling along the transect at Stations 112 and 115.\n\nThis can be seen by refer-\n\nring to Figure 2-26 which is a Grumman Data Systems digital printout of Bulk Band 4; the sun\nelevation and aximuth are located to scale in the lower right hand corner of the figure, and the\nprojected cloud shadow is seen to envelop the biological station 112 (Optical Station 5).\n\nFor\n\nthe digital value of Optical Station 5, the pixels closely adjacent outside of the cloud shadow\nwere used.\n2-42\n\nI1: i I\n\np71\n\n-iI i--\n\n=: -:i-.\n-t\n\n.i:\n\n:\n\n-l\n\nL7\n\n\'P t ji\n\n4\n\n:i O T\n\nF\n\n...\n\n....\n\n-~I\n\n-1\n\n.. .\n:~-\n\n4\n\n- 7-7\n\nT7-\n\n:7-7.\n\n-j- i -- j -\n\nI1: .. ....\n.....\n2.OD REFERENCE LEVEL\n....\n\n...\n\n.\n\n:-::!:::\n::R:]:7\n\n_....\n_t+_\n\niiijiirii~:Il~ :i::i\n::iij~iiii llli~iliiii2.ODl\n\n0\n\n:\n\nI:: :\n\n1?\n\nSEA WALL\n_Ili[_~__~.iTllSEA WALL\n\n4--\n\n-A\n...\n\nj.\n\n.1T.\n\n:::ii:--"S U H i\n!!i::i: :i iiii~~i\nll:i:ii\n\n77-t\n::\'\n\n1iliiiili\n\n"~~\n\nI:iiiiiiiir~~~~~\n\n. .. .\ni:: . ..\n\n--- --.\n\n.\n\nI\'\n\ntF\n\n. ...\n~\n\nlrIil~ lll liljjjj/jji liii~i i\n\nOPTCAL\nj\nSTATI:!::\nIONS::1:::::::\n\nKL\xc2\xb1~~\n~\n\nU:--l~fi\n\n.\n\n7_\n\n-_\n\n....\n\n.iiliii~i....\n;ri:\n\ni\n\n~\n\n: i \'::\n\n\'~~~\'""~_\n\nH-\n\nI.\n\n- -t~t-~tl\n-\n\n--\n\nrf~rfi--~\n\n~Lt~~f\n.\n\n. . .. .\n..\n\n. .... .....\n.. ..\n.\n\n...\n.:\n..\n..... .\n.\nil\n\n:\n\nr\n\n...._~ ....\n...\n....\n\niiiiiiii\n\n,,..\n\n:\nI\n\nI\n\n\'\n-__llllil.:l:lllllll.\n\nSOUT\n\'-. . -1-~-i\n. .\n\nt\n\n::.:i\n\n:/:::::\n\n- -t\n\nF:!:::iue -24.I:: icrodensitometry::::::1--::\nof"St\nhma\nabo\n.- 1..-1----1- -in\n--l l---- 1.1-.

The MSS detectors\nhave a finite response time to a step function. The step function is introduced when the\nscanner passes from a bright area to a dark area or vice versa. In Figure 2-27, the\nbright area is the cement sea wall at the St. Thomas Harbor edge; when the scanner passes\nfrom the sea wall to the much darker water, there is a finite time required to drop to the\nlower photometric level (response time). Thus the sea wall reads 61 (Line 1579 Band 4)\nand the water 40, and 3 pixels are involved in this transition; this effect is not the result of\noverlap in resolution elements of the scanner. In addition the town dock and Coast Guard\nship appeared to contribute to the high values of line 1580; hence, we used the values of\nline 1581-930 through 932 inclusive as being most representative of the water at optical\nstation #1.\n2.4.4 Computer Correlation of ERTS-1, I 2 S (Aircraft) and In Situ Optical, Biological\nand Chemical Water Data\nThe most feasible technique for comparison is the use of the computer generated\nmatrices of Tables 2-14 through 2-18. These matrices indicate the degree of correlation\nfrom -100 through 0 to +100. A value of +100 indicates a direct correlation and -100 an\ninverse correlation.\n\nA value of 0 indicates no correlation.\n\nTable 2-14 is a representation of the correlation features, over\nthe entire transect,\nof the optical in situ data, the aircraft photographic data, the ERTS-1 data, and the biological transect data of chlorophylls a and c, total chlorophyll, turbidity, pigment\ndiversity, and total carotenoids.\nIt can be seen in Table 2-14 that the in situ green and red as well as the aircraft\nred and green photography correlate well with the Bulk ERTS-1 Bands 4 and 5 and turbidity.\nThe pigment diversity shows some evidence of weak correlation with the in situ, aircraft\nphotographic and ERTS-1 data: chlorophylls a and c, total chlorophyll and total carotenoids\nreveal a yet weaker correlation.\nIn order to investigate these variations more fully, we devised the 3 station\nmatrices presented in Tables 2-15 through 2-18. The combinations are, sequentially:\noptical stations 1, 2 and 3; 2, 3 and 4; 4, 5 and 6; and 5, 6 and 7. All correlations will\nnot be discussed, because there is evident good correlation between the in situ aircraft\nphotographic and ERTS-1 red and green band data. However, the establishment of\na\ncorrelation with the water biology and chemistry is less clear.\n\n2-50\n\nHARBOR SEA WALL\nAND HIGHwAyL\n\nALONG TRACI SCAN LINES\n1578\n\nS\n\ntto

The correlation of all of these parameters is generally\nnegative in Tables 2-15 and 2-16 (near the sewage effluent area), and positive in Tables\n2-17 and 2-18, far from the sewage effluent area.\n\nThis means that there is low biological\n\nlevel, in terms of plant life, near the sewage effluent area, where the light scattering\nproperties of the harbor water is highest, (Ref 2), as generally would be expected. However,\nthe reversed trend is apparently the result of pigmentation and physical size of the biota\nin the St. Thomas Harbor entrance increasing the optical reflectance.\nThe strong correlation of pigment diversity with turbidity is an indication that there\nare strong variations in the factors making up the pigment diversity at the location where\nthe turbidity is highest. The five factors considered in pigment diversity are chlorophylls\na, b and c, the astacin and non-astacin carotenoids. This would be inferred to mean that\nthe level of biological activity is highest in the turbid areas even though the level of\npigments is not high.\nAs a further check on the optical properties of the St. Thomas Harbor transect,\nwater spectral transmission measurements were made on samples taken near optical\nstations 1 and 6.\n\nThese results are presented in Figures 29a and b. It is observed that\nthe water near the Coast Guard Dock (Optical Station 1) is highly absorbing throughout the\nvisible spectrum, with the strongest absorption in the blue region due to Gelbstoff. Further\nout at biological station 46 (near optical station 6) the level of Gelbstoff drops as expected.\nIt is possible that humic acids, dissolved nitrates and phosphates also could be associated\nwith the reduction in water quality near the Coast Guard Dock. Analysis of water samples\nwas made for these factors by C. Bassett at the Adelphi Institute of Marine Sciences. The\nresults are presented in Table 2-19. It is noted that the humic acids and the disolved\nnitrates and phosphates are highest in the region near the Coast Guard Dock (Optical\nStation 1) as would be expected.\n\n2-57\n\n:TURBIDITY\n\n01\n\n2.5 -\n\n25TOTAL CHLOROPHYL\n\nMSPU = MILLI SPECIAL PIGMENT UNITS\nF.T.U. = FORMAZIN TURBIDITY UNITS\n= (EQUIVALENT TO J.T.U.

The aircraft I2S camera green band was the only usable band for\npollution sensing under the conditions of operation in St. Thomas; for the red I2S band to\nbe useful, the exposure in this band would have to be increased.\nThe relation of the imagery (I2S and ERTS-1) to biology via turbidity is strong; the\ncorrelation to chlorophyll (total, a andc) and carotenoids is opposite in the region of high\npollution to that in the lower pollution areas.\n\nAlso the correlation to chemistry via\n\nturbidity is promising in terms of humic acids, nitrates and phosphates.\nThe optical remote sensing technique applied to a particular area depends upon the\ndesired spatial resolution and time of the survey.\n\nBoth ERTS-1 and I2S camera have\n\nsufficient photometric resolution to distinguish optical reflectance changes due to particulate\nmatter in the water. The exact correlation to the type of pollution must be made with a\nsuitable ground truth program, periodically updated.\nHowever the success of the entire program, particularly the photographic portion,\ndepended upon an adequate photometric calibration program as here used. In particular,\natmospheric filtration effects were revealed in so far as they affected color photography.\n\n2-60\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe author wishes to thank W.

It is situated on\ncommon shelf with the islands of Puerto Rico and all of the Virgin Islands except St. Croix,\nThis shelf\nwhich is separated from this small "continental mass" by the Anegada Trough.\nis an underwater plateau with its top lying 100 to 300 feet below the surface and falling off\n2000 square miles.

It covers about\nsummary of the shelf geology is to be found in Garrison et al (1971) and Nagle (1971).\nSt.\n\nAccording to Donnelly and Whetten (1968) the shelf and the islands are late\nCretaceous - early Tertiary in origin but are still in the process of formation. They are\nthe continental\nalso "oceanic islands" and hence have probably never been connected with\nmass.\n\nThis isolation has profoundly effected changes in the biotic configuration.\n\nSmall oceanic islands such as St. Thomas have little effect on the oceanic weather\nfrom the North\nand currents. The predominant currents affecting St. Thomas originate\nAtlantic and encounter the\nEquatorial and Carribbean currents which sweep in across the\n3-1\n\nlesser Antilles Island arc.\n\nThe current in the region of St. Thomas comes from the ESE\n\nat about 0. 5 kt. (U. S. Navy Oceanographic Office, 1972) during the months of October and\nNovember.\n\nThis same source shows that the wind in the region is either from the east or\n\nENE between 60 and 80% of the time.\n\nTabb and Michel (1968) summarized the wind direction\n\ndata for Truman field and showed that the wind is either east or ENE 57% of the time,\nfurther indicating the lack of land mass effects upon the weather.\nThe general oceanographic parameter trends have been summarized in Dammann\n(1969) and will be discussed alter with results from the present study.\nIt is particularly fortuitous that the present study should occur, since a primary\nsewage treatment plant will be put in operation by late fall 1973.\n\nThis plant will eliminate\n\nmost of sewage effluent into St. Thomas Harbor, and should do much to relieve St. Thomas\'\novertaxed facilities.\n\nThis strain has resulted from the fact that the population has more\n\nthan doubled in the last ten years to the 1970 census level of 30, 000 people in approximately\n32 square miles of available land.\n\nAdded to this is the island\'s yearly influx of tourists,\nwhich increases the population level greatly. The present study should serve as a valuable\nbaseline with which to compare later changes, subsequent to the initiation of the treatment\nplant.\nBesides raw sewage (3 million gallons per day peak) there are three other sources of\npollution within the study area.\n\nA black strap molasses plant pumps 154, 000 gallons of\n\nindustrial effluent into Charlotte Amalie Harbor daily.

These collections were\ncommenced at about 0700 and ended at 1100 on three different overflight days,\nalthough ERTS-1 data was available for Oct. 17, 1972 only.

Since the sampling\ncentered around the Charlotte Amalie region, the samples collected from the reef communities were taken from areas where there was at least some effect of the dumping within the\nharbor.\n\nThe sand and turtle grass community was also sampled from regions where there\n\nwas secondary influence of pollution (as in the case of the channel between St. Thomas,\nWater and Hassel Islands) or perturbations induced by the dredging and thermal effluent with\nLindbergh Bay.\n\nThe algal plain community was found offshore in cleaner oceanic waters\n\n3-9\n\nTable 3-3 shows the ranges between the mean community\nvalues.

Solid lines represent prevailing\nconditions while dotted lines indicate conditions during a Flood-tide related reversal.\n\nreversal is uncertain at present, although it may represent Atlantic waters coming around\nthe northwest corner of the island. A similar reversal has been reported from Puerto\nRico (Frank Torres, personal communication).\n\nAt these times the flow was reversed\n\nthrough the Gregerie channels and some minor effect was observed in the inner harbor\nalthough it was confined to the northwest end.\nThe current patterns during the three diurnal studies are shown in Figures 3-13\nthrough 3-15. At station 12, inner Charlotte Harbor, for days 311 and 312, the current\nnever exceeded .2 knots and flowed towards the northwest on the incoming tide and southeast on the outgoing tide. There were no apparent differences between surface, midwater\nand bottom currents and the low current velocities confused the directional picture\nsomewhat. It seems clear that this area was an unfortunate choice for the existing outfalls\nsince there is little circulation and the effluent tends to remain in the area.\nStation 9 exhibited strong current patterns over the course of the two diurnal studies\nconducted there. The narrow passage between Water and St. Thomas islands restricts the\ndirectional variation markedly.\n\nMaximum currents occurred during the incoming tide\n\nduring the 325-326 (Figure 3-15), and on the outgoing tide on the 318-319 (Figure 3-14)\nobservations. Since the normal current pattern is for the southeast oceanic current to the\nbranch off through the Gregerie channels, it would follow that during normal tidal conditions\nthe oceanic current would enhance the tidal current out the West Gregerie Channel. The\nperiod of 318-319 marked a period when the previously mentioned current reversal was\noccuring. In this case the oceanic current was flowing in opposition to the tidal current\nand damping the current velocity.\n\nDirectional uniformity at this station was to be expected\n\nsince the narrow channel did not offer much potential for directional variability.\n3.2.5 Salinity/Temperature and Water Mass\nPlots of salinity against temperature are frequently used to give indications of the\nexistence of water mass differences (Percious et al, 1972).\n\nIn Figures 3-16 through\n\n3-19 Salinity-Temperature (ST) plots give further evidence of the pollutive effects from\nCharlotte Amalie harbor. In the one-time areal sampling, there is an inherent temporal\nvariability, but Figures 3-16 (bottom depth) and 3-17 (5 feet below surface) indicate the\noffshore cool water mass (cluster A in both figures) as being distinct from the inshore\nmass which is both warmer and lower in salinity (cluster B in both figures). Temporal\nvariation is also evidenced in these figures by cluster C in both figures which were subjected\nto increased salinity (when compared to the inshore cluster of points).\n\nThe surface waters\n\n3-31\n\n.5\n\nPREDICTED TIDE\nCURRENT\n.5\n\nW\n-360\n\n6bot.\n-240\n\n....\n,mid.\n\n\'\n\n|*sur.\n\no.9\n\n*mid.\n\nCURRENT DIRECTION\n\n12"..\n\n.50PLANKTON CONCENTRATION\n\n.25\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n18\n\n21\nHOUR\n\n24\n\n3\n\n6\n\nFigure 3-13.

The normal state is evidenced by\ncluster A while three distinct additional clusters are observed both south of Lindbergh Bay\n(Cluster C), within Lindbergh Bay (Cluster D), and in the inner harbor and West Gregerie\nchannel (Cluster B).\nSalinity/Temperature plots of the three diurnal studies indicate that Station 9\n(at the junction of West and East Gregerie channels) is relatively uniform, (Figure 3-19\nClusters A and B). At Station 12 (in front of the sewage outfall at King\'s Wharf) there is an\nobservable difference resulting in a cluster of daytime points (Cluster C) which are distinct\nfrom the night time points (Cluster D). This is probably related to diurnal sewage patterns.\n3.2.6 Plankton Concentration\nThe plankton concentration was derived from the total volume of plankton captured\nin a vertical tow, divided by the depth of the tow. In Figure 3-20 the values for plankton\nconcentration (cc/M 3 ) are plotted. The average values from the 17 repetitive stations\nindicate much the same water quality statements as the benthic sampling. Clean oceanic\n3\nwater has a concentration of between less than .01 and .15 cc/M . Detailed contour lines\ncould not be drawn since the variability between days was too great. The variability from\nhour to hour (Figures 3-13 thru 3-15) was also very great so that samples taken from\ndifferent times of the day could not be validly compared.\nabundance were observed during the 24 hour studies.\n\nNo diurnal trends in plankton\n\n3.2.7 Plankton Pigments\nDiurnal variation in pigment and water parameters was investigated in the series of\nthree 24 hour studies.

The sites were selected on the basis of prior information from the repetitive sampling\nStation 12 was selected as being typical of the inner harbor with .its low circulation\nand high eutrophication levels from nearby outfalls. Station 9 was located in the channel\nbetween Water Island, Hassell Island and St. Thomas. It was chosen because of the great\n\nprogram.\n\nvariability exhibited, presumably due to the funnelling effect of the surrounding land masses.\nThe choice of days furnished us with comparisons between two locales at tidal cycles\n\n3-37\n\n29.5\n\n29.0\n\no\n\n28.5\n\nI.-\n\nI\n\nsm\n\n28.0-\n\n27.5\n\n27.0 [\n\nI\n\n,\n\nq\n\nC\n\nI\n\n-\n\nD\n\nSALINITY\n\n(PPM)\n\nFigure 3-18.

Further work on this question (of allowance lag between ground truth and\nsatellite\nobservation) must certainly be undertaken before correlative data can be assigned\ncausative\ninterpretation.\n3.2.8 Initial Correlation With Uncorrected ERTS-1 Bulk CCT Data\nStatistical analysis of the relationship between ERTS imagery and ground-truth\nwater\nquality variables was somewhat hampered by cloud cover on all but the October\n17 overflight.\nPartial cloud cover on that day caused us to eliminate several data points\nand therefore the\nfollowing treatment is based on 31 points where plankton pigment density\nand turbidity could\nbe related to cloud-free ERTS bulk CCT quantum data.

Chlorophyll a and total Carotenoids were not significant at the .05% level) but\nthe results indicate that further work may establish a relationship.\n\nTurbidity was highly\n\nsignificant in its relation to the Band 5 data. This is particularly encouraging for remote\nsensing since turbidity is easily measured and appears to be one of the strongest indicators\nof environmental disruption in the present study.\n\nThis last statement is supported by the\n\nfact that benthic diversity correlated with turbidity (r = .655, p .01,\n\ndf - 67).\n\nBenthic\n\ndiversity has been used in the present study to delineate long-term responses by the biotic\ncommunity to water quality degradation from pollutants.\n\nThis tie between satellite spectral\n\ndata, turbidity, and benthic diversity offers encouragement for the ERTS program for use\nnot only as a monitoring device but also as a device for indicating changes in key variables\npertinent to water quality.\n3.3 DISCUSSION\nThe ground truth data acquisition documented the areas of long term influence from\nthe continued disposal of raw sewage and minor industrial waste into the region of Charlotte\nAmalie harbor.\n\nAlthough the inshore areas, particularly the inner harbor which was almost\n\ndevoid of benthic life, show reduced species diversity in the benthic community and increased\nturbidity, and higher phytoplankton pigment concentration (presumably in response to the\neutrophicative effects of the dumping); this effect extends out less than two miles into the\noffshore sublittoral.\nAnalysis of the chemical and oceanographic parameters associated with "water\nquality" demonstrated the dynamic nature of these parameters. Water movement, light,\nhuman activity, and weather parameters all effect changes in these parameters. The\nresulting matrix patterns are further complicated by a high degree of intercorrelation\nbetween parameters which prevents valid univariate statements.\n\nMultiple regression\n\nanalysis of the data offers some hope for establishing functional relationships within the\nmatrix.\nThe studies of diurnal variability indicated a homogeneity between different times\nat the same locale although short time temporal variability is too great to permit valid\nstatistical analysis between locales.\n\n3-44\n\nThis finding offers encouragement for remote sensing\n\n<\nu\n\n22---\n\nY=AX+ B\n95% C.I.\n\n-J\n\n18\n\n14\n\n5\n\n10\n\nCAROTENOIDS (MSPU/M\n\n3\n\nFigure 3-22.

We noted the interaction between bottom topography,\nwind and tidal currents in determining current direction and velocity. The current within\nthe inner harbor is low and the waters are generally higher in salinity and temperature.\nWithin the inner harbor there is greater variability in the water column than in the offshore\nwaters.\n\nThe general current trends indicate that these offshore waters are divided by\nthe harbor entrance and Hassell Island. The water mass is funnelled through the Gregerie\nChannel and normally flows southwest until it rejoins the oceanic water mass. In the\narea south of Lindbergh Bay the inshore waters effect variable water conditions throughout\nlarge area.\nTwice during the course of the study (during maximum tidal flow) this general\ntrend was reversed and the offshore current flowed from the southwest instead of the\nsoutheast.\n\nThe cause of this reversal was not further investigated but the effects should\nbe taken into consideration in any ocean dumping plans by the Virgin Islands\' government.\nAt present this reversal carries much of the loose garbage from the solid waste disposal\nsite at Harry S. Truman Airport back into the Gregerie Channels. This unfortunate\nconsequence could be rectified by regulating dumping during these periods.\nthe new sewage outfall could be affected during reversal periods.\n\nWaste from\n\nBenthic sampling indicates that the waters of the inner harbor have effected changes\nin the benthic communities adjacent to the harbor and extending from at least Rupert Rock\n(Station 13) and southwest to the airport. The inner harbor and Crown Bay is almost\ndevoid of life.\n\nAlthough circulation from the waters of the Gregarie Channel may result in\na "return" to a diverse community type, the inner harbor will certainly lag behind since\nthere is little circulation.\nThe ERTS MSS Band 5 appears capable of monitoring turbidity, which is one of\nthe water quality parameters measured in the "Ground Truth" program. Turbidity is also\none of the best indicators of water quality and correlates with benthic diversity.\n\n3-48\n\nBenthic diversity is the best indicator of the long term water quality conditions\nexisting within the study area. The reason for this was simply that water chemistry\nparameters are very dynamic and instantaneous measurements are stochastically unrepresentative of parametric conditions. We observed a significant correlation between\nbenthic diversity and turbidity. The inferential web that is being woven is that the satellite\nappears to have the capability of sensing turbidity which suggests benthic diversity which is\nindicative of long term water quality conditions.\n\nChanges in turbidity are complex and our\n\nattempts to relate turbidity and ERTS data to two possible sources of increased turbidity\n(Chlorophyll a and Total Carotenoids) were somewhat hampered by the small sample size.\nTurbidity is a complex parameter and changes in any of a number of oceanographic\nparameters can effect changes in it. Certainly phytoplankton blooms as well as sedimentation in the highly euthrophicated waters of Charlotte Amalie Harbor and Crown Bay should\nshow up as increases in turbidity.\nThe results of this analysis suggest positive areas of application for the satellite in\nwater quality monitoring. - The study task attempted to define areas of similar "water\nquality" through the analysis of a broad spectrum of parameters generally considered to be\nindicative of variability in this condition.\n\n(1)The correlation of "water quality" and marin biology data with satellite data is treated\nfurther in Sections II and IV.\n\n3-49\n\nACKNOWLEDGE MENTS\nAs in all field operations, any success is due to the cooperation and assistance of\nmany people.\n\nThe present project was particularly fortunate in that the field team was\n\nmade up of people that were both highly skilled and cooperative.\n\nI think that one of the\n\ngreatest achievements of the field operations is that we all parted friends.\n\nBelow are\n\nlisted most of the people who either worked on the project or aided it through advice and\nexpedition of our interests in the vagaries of the field situation.\nIan Koblick, MRDF president, was responsible for much of the planning during\nproposal preparation.\nField Data Acquisition\nPaul Blackwell - Diver - Research Assistant (MRDF)\nTom Conway - Field Instrumentation Technician - Grumman Aerospace\nDick Cutler - Field Research Assistant - Grumman Ecosystems\nArthur Dammann - Oceanographic consultation - V.I.

This enabled both "first\nlook" anomaly detection, parameter correlation and the specification of final data handling\nsteps required to assess the applicability of ERTS data for monitoring water quality.\nParagraphs 4. 2 and 4. 3 of this report discuss input data and automatic data handling.\nEach of the major analog and digital data products utilized to initially ascertain satellite-toaircraft correlation, and satellite/aircraft-to-water quality relationships are discussed in\nparagraph 4.4. These initial data handling results, both by Grumman Data Systems (ERTS &\n\n4-1\n\nIN SITU) and Dr. W. Egan of Grumman Aerospace Corporation (Optical and Aircraft)\ntogether suggested a strong ERTS-to-optical data and ERTS-to-turbidity correlation.\n\nThe\n\nlatter correlation was also deduced following analysis performed by Dr. D. Olsen of the\nMarine Resources Development Foundation.\nGrumman computers were employed subsequently to test these findings.\n\nFollowing\n\nconversion of MSS quantum data to radiance values and the elimination of cloud affected data\npoints, automated statistical analysis techniques confirmed these initial deductions.\n\nResults\n\nare contained in paragraph 4.4.\nAlso discussed in paragraph 4.4 are observations made by the writer during the course\nof this project.\n\nSummary conclusions, including one related to the application of ERTS data\n\nin visible sea bottom mapping will, we believe, be of use in future studies related to water\nquality.\n4.1 INPUT DATA FORMATS\n4.1.1 Computer Base Map\nThe Department of Commerce C & GS Map #933 served as the base map for this\nstudy.\n\nEach data station was defined as the area contained in a 1-second longitude by 1-\n\nsecond latitude (1" x 1") cell.\n\nMap #933 was digitized and a computer program enabled the\n\nproduction of the base map illustrated in Figure 4-2.\n\nEach computer line printer character\n\ncorresponded to a unique 1" x 1" cell.\n\n..............\n\n=:..==\n\n.\nCELLS!\n\n.......\n. . . ........EBE "\n. - ............\n\nFigure 4-2.\n4-2\n\n..\n\nComputer Base Map - St. Thomas Harbor\n\n4.1.2 In Situ Logs\nAll boat collected in situ data were either directly entered onto or finally transferred\nto Grumman 80 column Field Data Report forms.

In situ data, orginally recorded\non log sheets (sample in Appendix 1) were keypunched and automatically averaged (over a\ndesired time span) with resultant values appearing as a numeric character ranging between\n\n4-5\n\n0 and 9 - (minimum and maximum ranges, respectively).\n\nThese averages (scaled) were\n\nprinted in the 1 second by 1 second map cell associated with each water quality station.\n* Current meter data was converted from microfilm to keypunch cards. A computer\nprogram enabled an analog strip chart display of current velocity, direction,\neast-west and north-south components, predicted tide curves, and time data.\nCorrections for magnetic deviation were applied through a least square\'s third\norder calibration curve computed from Endeco supplied calibration data. Also\nmagnetic variation correction was incorporated for true north output. Figure 4-6\nillustrates the strip chart output record.\n* Data listings, through utilization of the Grumman DEPRINTER program, were\nmade available in four formats (listed below).\nDEPRINTER sorts and tabulates user specified parameters stored in the blocks\nof data resident in the mass storage data base.\n\n(CDC 854 disk).\n\nAvailable Listings\n1.\n\nFormat A - Lists the station, location, acquisition data and data value for\neach in situ measurement recorded.\n\n2.\n\nFormat B - Lists the station, depth, acquisition data and data value for a\nmaximum of 4 user-specified measurements.\n\n3.\n\nFormat C - Lists the weather conditions for a user-specified station.\n\n4.\n\nFormat D - Lists all data parameters acquired at a user-specified station.\n(A message is printed if no data is available for a particular station. Further,\nthis type of tabulation sorted the data first by sampling type* and then by\nstation number and lastly listed in chronological order.)\n\n*\n\nMeasurement value vs time graphs were created via the Grumman DEPICTUR\nprogram which sorts and arranges data in a chronological order on a selective\nbasis.\n\n(User specifies starting and end time, station number, sample depth, and\nparameter ID). Resultant outputs are graphs displayed on CRT and transferrable\nto 35 and 16 mm microfilm. Paragraph 4.3.4 contains sample outputs of the\nDEPICTUR PROGRAM.\n*\n\nThermal IR data was rectilinearized with S-curve corrections applied through\nutilization of the system depicted in Figure 4-4.

Imagery of\nthe\ndesalinization/power plant located on Lindbergh Bay is shown in Figure 4-5.\nThe demonstrated ability of the ERTS MSS system to provide over 100 computer\nresolution elements in the approximately 700 x 900 meter bay suggests that\na future ERTS\ncontaining the NASA planned 10. 4 to 12. 6 nanometer thermal IR band with\nan instantaneous\nfield of view of S 3 times that of bands 1-4, and thermal resolution better\nthan 1. 20 C will\nbe capable of monitoring the subject thermal plume (28-310C\nrange).\nERTS MSS band 7 was used together with easily recognizable land water\ninterface\npoints to compare charted land mass-to-land mass distances (water separated).\nComputer\n\n4-8\n\nINTENSITY 1.94 BACKGROUND 2.6\n\nINTENSITY 2.04\n\nigr\n\nJ-.LnbrhBySitWoaVI\n\nlii\n\n.-\n\n4\n\ni\n\nINTENSITY 2.14\n\nFigure 4-5.\n\nBACKGROUND 2.8\n\nVi~mtr\n\ne~\n\n1\n\nii i\n\n-9\n\nBACKGROUND 3.0\n\nLindbergh Bay Saint Thomas, V.I. 8. 0-14. 0 Micrometer Thermal IR\n\n4-9\n\nprintouts revealed an accuracy of between 1/2 and 1. 0 the area represented by each printout\ncharacter (pixel) of approximately 57 meters by 79 meters.\nCCT data from band 7 enabled mapping of land/water boundaries to within a 1-2 pixel\naccuracy.\n4. 3. 2 Analog Current Meter Measurement Time Histories\nRaw data (16 MM microfilm) was processed on a semi-automatic reader-recorder\nwith valid data segments being converted to keypunch cards for computer entry.\nA digital program effected the transfer of time of day, current speed, and current\ndirection data to an analog pen recorder. Resultant strip charts were utilized to record\ncurrent velocity and direction vs time for each Endeco Type 105 current meter.\nStrip charts generated through utilization of a digital-to-analog converter, were\nformatted as shown below in Figure 4-6.\n4. 3. 3 Scaled In Situ Data Summary Maps\nFollowing entry of all in situ data into the computer data base, selected water\nquality parameters were plotted on the scaled computer maps utilizing the following criteria:\nDEPTH:\n\nSelectable, Number of feet \xc2\xb1 tolerance in feet or midpoint \xc2\xb1 tolerance in %.\n\nTIME:\n\nSelectable, user specifies single day, or, if an average over more than\none day is required, start and stop days.\n\nResultant map printouts show averaged parameter values per station at a scale of\n0 to 9. 0 pertains to lowest value recorded and 9 the maximum value recorded for the\nselected test period. Additionally, the minimum, maximum and average values over the\nentire test period are displayed.\nFigures 4-7 and 4-8 are segments of actual maps generated during the study program.

These graphs\nincluded sample station number, start date, end date and parameter name and depth.\n\nThe\n\ncomputer program also enabled recording measurement graphs on 35 mm and 16 mm microfilm.\n\nFilm products were read on a roll film reader with key data areas being converted to\n\nhard copy.\n\nExamples are contained in Figures 4-13 and 4-14.\n\n4. 3. 5 In Situ Measurement Listings\nIn situ measurement listings are available, in the formats indicated in Figures 4-15a\nand 4-15b, and constitude complete data listings per data station. These are in chronological order, indicating measurement values - with up to four selectable parameters permissible per page.\n\nThese listings comprise the bulk of status data for St. Thomas Harbor.\n\nAdditionally, the analyst can also obtain data printouts sorted by measurement name\nand by weather conditions.\nMeasurement listings were useful in extracting weather and boat mounted current\nmeter data and serving as the detailed reference manual from which measurement summary\nmaps were created.\n4. 3.6 Scaled Computer Maps - Precision & Bulk CCT Data\nComputer aided graphics were employed to facilitate both understanding the variance\nin "water quality" with location, and also correlation of in situ, aircraft and spacecraft data.\nIn each case, satellite computer maps were accompanied with listings of MSS data values at\nand surrounding each data station.\nMSS values for each subject station.\n\n~ 4-14\n\nFigure 4-16 for example, indicates a scaled map and\n\n.....................\n.\n\n.\n\n. .\n\n.\n\n. .\n\n.. .\n\n..\n........\n\n.\n\n.\n\n. .. . .\n\n. .\n\n.\n\n....................\n. .\n\n...\n\n. .

(Mapping\nbased on MSS quantum levels ranging from 0 to 127).\nPrecision CCT and Bulk CCT values at and surrounding sample stations were computed\nfor precision MSS Bands 4-6 and for bulk MSS Bands 4-7.

Each cell was shaded according to its MSS quantum value, based\nupon 127 counts. Utilization of the resultant maps enabled rapid determination of overall\nMSS ranges within the study area, was useful in establishing the geographic location of\nclouds, and demonstrated the ability of ERTS to provide acceptable resolution within the\nnarrow channels and bays of St. Thomas Harbor.\nAlthough the MSS harbor map was manually generated* future programs calling for\nrepetitive (i. e. 18 day) CCT\'s should take advantage of computer plotters which can provide\nmaps much more efficiently. Either the computer output microfilm system or the computer\noutput plotter could be used for bulk CCT-to-map overlay generation.\n4.4\n\nFINAL ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nData handling for the St. Thomas Program was comprised of the subject matter discussed in Sections 1-4 of this report. Preliminary statistical analyses were discussed with\nDr. Egan, Dr. Olsen and coordinated by W. Coulbourn.\n\nFinally, computer processing was\n\ntailored to achieve three goals:\n1)\n\nDetermination of degrees of correlation of in situ acquired data with aircraft and\nsatellite data.\n\n2)\n\nDetermination of the applicability of computer automated simulation techniques\nto future investigations.\n\n3)\n\nUtilization of CCT data for sea bottom mapping.\n\n*The limited quantity of satellite data received did not warrant software modification.\n4-25\n\n.. .........................\n..........\n\n. ...........\ni\n\nTURBIDITY (Surface)\nRange:\n0.12 F.T.U. to 3.10 F.T.U.\n\nAverage:\n\n0.9h F.T.U.\n\nTest Duration:\nScaled:\n\n* Min.,\n\nDay 283 to 326, 1972\n\n0 Max.\n\nFigure 4-18.

Correlation runs 3 and 4\n(Tables 4-2 through 4-5) agree, in that a stronger in situ to aircraft and satellite correlation was recorded in outer waters.\nAlso indicated in the correlation tables is a strong ERTS-to-carotenoids* correlation\nin-shore but a negative correlation in outer harbor waters.\n\n(rjk = -. 90 (MSS4), -. 69 (MSS5)\n\nin Run 2 and +. 88 (MSS4), +. 84 (MSS5) in Run 5.\n\nSimilarly, ERTS-to-Chlorophylls a, b, c,\ncomparisons show negative correlation in-shore and strong positive correlation in outer\nwaters.\n*Plant & Animal Pigments\nTable 4-1 indicates that ERTS MSS Bands 4 and 5 are useful for monitoring harbor\nturbidity.\nThe known link between benthic diversity and turbidity and the indicated strong\nERTS-to-turbidity correlation is indeed promising from a standpoint of developing a method\nof applying ERTS data.\n\nCorrelation tables, however show only weak ERTS to biological data\n\ncorrelations.\n\nAdditional satellite and in situ data are required to establish with certainty if,\nand to what extent biological parameter status can be related to turbidity and thence to ERTS\ndata.\nPrecision MSS 4 values showed weaker correlation with aircraft and turbidity data.\nNote however, that cloud shadow corrections were not employed.\n\nAlthough a bulk CCT vs\n\nprecision CCT evaluation was not part of this program, favorable precision-to-turbidity\nresults were shown in cloud free areas.\n\n(Paragraph 4.4.2.1).\n\nA comparison of Figures 4. 20\n\nand 4.21 (shown in paragraph 4.4) suggests that additional data is needed in order to specify\nthe overall merits of precision vs bulk CCT\'s.\n\nGeometric correction of the bulk digital data\nwithout degradation in radiometric fidelity is of course desired.\n\n4-32\n\nTable 4-1.\n\nIn Situ\n\nR,-d\n\nAi r\n\n2\n\nr a ft Ai\\il i\nraft\n\n3\n\nrft\n\nN1\n\n0r\n\nPrecision\n\n7\n\n0\n\n.; 1\n\n99\n\nNISS I\n\nBulk.SS\n\nN1\n\n5\n\n:\n\n0\n\n0\n\n15\n\n2\n\n17\n\n:\n\n-11\n\n\'0\n\n5\n\nTo-\n\n-o\n1G\n\n5T\n\n15\n\n2\n\n:i\n\n2\n\n-\n\n4.\nI\n\n5:1\n\nN\n\n0(\n\n-;\n\n5:;\n\n0\n\no\n\n31\n\nhlorph\n\n6\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n19\n\n2.5\n\nChlorophyll A\n\nanorr\n\n.-\n\n5\n\n124\n\n2:1\n\n-\n\n17\n\n26\n\nTurit\n\nfor tniospheric ttenuation\nctd\n..

4. 2. 1 Correlation of Satellite Data With In Situ Turbidity Data.\n\nDuring the six-week in\n\nsitu data collection period, many turbidity measurements were taken during tidal periods\nsimilar to the one which occurred during the time of the ERTS-1 overpass on 17 October\n1972.\nThe strong degree of correlation between ERTS MSS bands 4 and 5 and turbidity, as\nreported in paragraph 4.4. 1. 1, suggested that an additional correlation be performed, namely\nERTS-1, 17 October data vs turbidity data acquired over the 6-week test period but only\nwithin the ERTS-1 overpass tidal window.\n\n(Tidal windows are listed in paragraph 4.5.4.)\n\nThree sets of correlation were performed:\n1)\n\nSt. Thomas Harbor Only (Stas. 9-16 & 69)\n\n2)\n\nTotal Test Site (Stas. 2-16 & 69)\n\n3)\n\nTotal Test Site Minus Stas. 7, 8, 9 in West Gregerie Channel\n\nThe validity of tidal window data for West Gregerie Channel was not considered\nreliable due to the rapid changes in current direction.\n\nResultant improved correlation for\n\nset 3 substantiates this deletion.\nThe selected tidal window was 1 hour before to 2 hours following low water slack.\nResultant correlation coefficients (rjk) were as follows:\nSet 1)\n\n.706 vs Precision MSS Band 4\n.660 vs Bulk MSS Band 5\n. 638 vs Bulk MSS Band 4\n\nSet 2)\n\n. 645 vs Precision MSS Band 4\n. 514 vs Bulk MSS Band 4\n. 399 vs Bulk MSS Band 5\n\nSet 3)\n\n.657 vs Bulk MSS Band 5\n.626 vs Bulk MSS Band 4\n.610 vs Precision MSS Band 4\n\n4-38\n\nAn original intent of the St. Thomas data handling program was to compare three\nsets of ERTS data (i. e.,\n\nAlthough data from\n\nthree separate overpasses) with harbor data.\n\nonly one overpass was available, coefficients shown above are based on 6 week data, when\ncombined with the results of the transect data study (paragraph 4. 5. 1), establishes that\nMSS bands 4 and 5 strongly correlate with turbidity.\nNo significant corre-\n\nSix week in situ data was also compared to ERTS MSS band 6.\nlation was recorded.\n\n(Bands 6 and 7 penetrate the water only very slightly.)\n\n4.4.2.2 Analysis of Harbor Data in "Tidal Window" Time Frames.\n\nA statistical analysis\n\nof data collected throughout the program, but selected from only those time periods which\ncorresponded closest with tidal conditions existing at the time of the ERTS overpass, or\n"Tidal Windows", was made.\n\nFurther, the data was segregated into four distinct groups\n\n(see Chart Figure I-1).\n*\n\nInner harbor data (Sample stations No.: 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13)\n\n*\n\nIntermediate harbor data (Sample stations No.: 2, 4, 5, 6)\n\n*\n\nOuter harbor data (Sample Stations No.: 3, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17)\n\n*\n\nRepetitive Sample Station Data (Sample Stations 2 through 17)\n\nThe first three areas, above, were selected on the basis of their spatial similarity\nrelative to harbor topography while the last set was selected to check use of data from all\nstations during the same tidal window.\n\nData acquired in the satellite tidal window was used\n\nto improve homogeneity of samples by providing information which should be more representative of the conditions of the harbor during the satellite overpass, although acquired on\ndifferent days.\n\nAdditionally, these results were used to compare general harbor conditions,\n\nas explained by Olsen (page 3-19) to those at the time of satellite overpass.\n\n4-39\n\nThe objective of using tidal window data was to relate in situ turbidity data to other\nwater quality parameters.\n\nIf positive results were obtained then ERTS detectability of turbi-\n\ndity, determined by the transect data, could be utilized as an inferential indicator of these\nparameters.\n\nGenerally, by inspection of the correlation tables this hypothesis was not sup-\n\nported (see correlation table, keyed to harbor maps).\nAs a further test insofar as data collected allows, the underlying determinants of\nwater quality were investigated by use of factor analysis. The accuracy of factor analysis is\ndependent upon a linear relationship between variables and normal multivariate distributions.\nThe aim in factor analysis is to account for, or explain, the matrix of covariance by a minimum, or at least a small number, of hypothetical variates, or \'factors\'.\n\nHere we attempt\n\nto assign determinants of conditions affecting the defined harbor areas, whatever their basic\nnature, in terms of a relatively small role in determining the other water quality parameters.\nHowever, the importance of turbidity is at a maximum in the inner harbor areas, Tables 4-6,\n7, 8, 9). Inasmuch as this experiment was directed at determining the application of the ERTS\nin harbor areas, and the coastal zone, and the primary detectable parameter was turbidity,\nthis is an encouraging qualitative, if not overpowering quantitative finding.\n\nComparison of\n\nthe Tidal Window factor tables with the conclusions of Dr. Olsen, show that the role turbidity plays during the ERTS Tidal Window is very low compared to its role in Dr. Olsen\'s\nanalysis.\n\n(Olsen\'s results based on use of all data showed a turbidity role of -. 77 in Table\n\n3-8 VIII page 3-26, whereas much lower numbers (8 to 29) were calculated when using only the\ntidal window data, Tables 4-6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nThe availability of only a single ERTS overpass has\n\ndisallowed comparison with other tidal conditions to see if better correlation with turbidity\nwould occur during other tidal windows.\n\nIt is recommended that repetitive coverage to esta-\n\nblish chronistic data acquisition parameters related to turbidity and other ERTS detectable\nmeasures and harbor tidal conditions be made in the future.\n4.4. 3 Application of Computer Automated Simulation Software to ERTS CCT Data\nIt has been stated earlier that either the computer output microfilm system and/or the\ncomputer output plotter could be of valuable assistance to investigators requiring a "contour\nview" of ERTS computer data for geographical areas under study.\nStill another meaningful application of ERTS data is the conversion of CCT values to a\ngraphics format enabling the investigator to obtain perspective views over a fixed geographical\narea. Figures 4-23 and 4-24 show plots generated via the simulation technique. Two separate\nviewing angles are shown.\n\n4-40\n\nTable 4-6.\n\nIntermediate Harbor Sample Stations No\'s 2, 4-6 (Satellite Tidal Windows)\nCORRELATION MATRIX\n\nWind

MSS CCT Data (Viewing Angle:\n\nEast to West)\n\n4-45\n\nIn generating the figures shown on the preceding page, Grumman "Automated Simulation of Terrain" software was utilized.\n\nFormerly, the simulation technique was employed\n\nto aid in landscape management via computer-generated views of large landscapes from\nselected ground sites and altitudes.\nIn adapting this software for use with ERTS data, each bulk MSS CCT pixel became\nan intersection point on a grid overlaying St. Thomas Harbor.\n\nThe "height" or "z" value at\n\nintersect points was directly related to pixel (or MSS computer printout) values.\nWith MSS CCT values entered into computer storage, a variety of output graphics\ndisplays can be generated from a single matrix of values by varying look directions (i. e.,\none point in a grid to another) and by varying the vertical height above the grid.\n\nOutput was\n\ngenerated via a Calcomp plotter.\nMSS graphics presentations, in this format, possess several advantages:\n1.\n\nConceptualization of MSS values, per band, in x, y, and z values.\n\n2.\n\nComparison of bands via plot overlays.\n\n3.\n\nCoordination with topographic overlays.\n\n4.\n\nSimulation of in situ data, along a transect, with ERTS values.\n\n5.\n\nAnomaly detection.\n\n6.\n\nPresents intensity as a third dimension (vertical) on a large scale horizontal\nplot, and facilitates rapid comprehension by the human eye.\n\nAmong other applications is the presentation of sets of data taken over time from\nsampling stations on a transect.\n\nFinal presentations enable combination of spectral, spatial\n\nand temporal aspects of in situ, satellite, and aircraft data in a single format.\nGraphics overlays of three or more MSS bands, presented with identical look angle\nand viewing height, present the data interpretor with a valuable tool in studies related to\ndetermining land/water boundaries and misalignment of data points (pixels) between bands\ndue to sensor error.\nFinally, the utilization of MSS-to-x,y, z plotting technique, when applied for specific\nareas and for each ERTS overpass, offers a practical and valuable tool for displaying trends\nand cause and effect relationships.\nFigure 4-32\n\n4-46\n\n(Page 4-69) is a further example of MSS-to-simulation plotting.\n\n4.4.4\n\nMapping of Visible Sea Bottom\nIn order to determine the usefulness of ERTS CCT data for bottom mapping of high\n\nclarity water areas, a study of St. James Bay (Ref. Figure 4-25) on Eastern St. Thomas\nData utilized consisted of Bulk CCT MSS bands 4 and 7, and multiband\n\nwas undertaken.\n\nBalY\n\nGreat\n\n5\n\n9\n\n65\n\n4-47\n4-47\n\nThe initial step taken was the initilization of MSS band 7 OCT data to determine\nland/watei interface areas. Findings, namely island boundaries, were superimposed onto\na data printout generated from COT MSS band 4.

S. G. S. quadrangle map.\nAreas A, B and the indicated coral reef are not visible on the 0. 74 - 0. 90 micron\nphoto, thus indicating their being subsurface features:\n4.4.5 Final Notes\nAs a result of the data handling activities carried out during this program several\npoints, which are briefly mentioned below, are believed worth highlighting1) Satellite CCT Printouts, when compared to C & GS charts showed an accuracy\nwithin the instantaneous field of view of approximately 80 meters.\n\n(i. e., \xc2\xb1 one\n\ncomputer printout pixel)\n2) Land/Water Interfaces were most easily determined through the use of MSS band 7,\nas expected\n\n4-50\n\nFigure 4-29.\n\nFigure 4-30.\n\n0.41 - 0. 47 micron Aircraft Photography\nSt. James Bay\n\n0. 74 - . 90 micron Aircraft Photography\nSt. James Bay\n\n4-51\n\n3) Cloud Location was best determined through use of CCT computer dumps of\nMSS band 5\n4) Determination of CCT MSS Values from Computer Printouts required blanking out\nof all values from 53 to 127 and printing only values from 0 to 52.\n\nWhere resultant\n\nprintouts showed blank areas, those areas were classified as being in the higher\nenergy range and examined in detail where necessary (i. e., Brewers Beach).\nThis process was mandatory since, for example, under the NASA mapping scheme\non "E" could represent either 18 or 67. If blanking out of upper level showed no\n"E\'s" these were read as 18.\n5) ERTS-1 Imagery was used for reference primarily.*\n\nMSS data was extracted\n\nfrom the CCT tape by computer for correlation with in situ and aircraft data.\n6) Comparison of Precision and Bulk CCT Data revealed precision data to be significantly superior in terms of local geographical resolution. (i. e., a \xc2\xb1 1 element\npositional, error in Bulk CCT\'s was observed).\n\nUse of Bulk CCT\'s necessitated\n\ncluster averaging; namely, determining the average radiance of a group of cells\nin the subject area. Care, however, must be exercised when the value of one\nelement varied sharply from the value of other group cells. (See discussion in\nSection 4. 3. 7).\n7) Graphics Data Summaries for both satellite and in situ data played the major role\nin data handling. Measurement listings were utilized primarily to extract data\npoints to be utilized in performing correlations.\n8) Utilization of 80 Column In Situ Logs are recommended.\n\nTheir use prevents the\n\nnecessity of having to transfer boat data listings to 80 column computer keypunch\nforms.\n9) Determination of bulk MSS CCT values for specific geographical areas may be\nachieved via construction of a transparent grid overlay to a standard map.\n(Reference Figure 4-31).\nThe overlay shown was generated through use of band 7 computer\nprintouts to locate sharp land-water interface points with respect to\nsatellite track and cross track CCT printout lines. The number of\npixels versus ground distance, as measured on a map, yielded the\nground distance per pixel and permitted construction of an overlay\nwith grid lines that correlated directly to computer print lines.\n*Discussed in Report Section II by Dr. Egan.\n4-52\n\n4.5 DATA TABULATION\n4.5. 1 In Situ Boat Data Log-Keypunch Compatible\n\nGRUMMAN\n\nCOr-OYOTMM\nBLT\n"NE\n\no\n\nY\n\nCHARACTERSARE WRITTEN AS FOLLOWS\n.
