The desire to provide software which gives the user the choice between the often conflicting goals of minimizing central processing (CPU) time or storage requirements has led to a diagonal-based algorithm in which one of three types of storage is selected for each diagonal. For each storage type, an initialization sub-routine estimates the CPU and storage requirements based upon results from previously performed numerical experimentation. These requirements are adjusted by weights provided by the user which reflect the relative importance the user places on the resources. The three storage types employed were chosen to be efficient on the CYBER-203 for diagonals which are sparse, moderately sparse, or dense; however, for many densities, no diagonal type is most efficient with respect to both resource requirements. The user-supplied weights dictate the choice.", "title": "Efficient spares matrix multiplication scheme for the CYBER 203", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T23:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840012157, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lambiotte, J.
