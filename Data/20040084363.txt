An overview of these studies is summarized below.\n\nNovel magnetometer boom design and prototype manufacture For all upcoming nanosatellite space physics missions, a magnetometer will be part of any\nscientificpayload. For the purposes of this prototyping study, we chose a digital magnetometer\nas the strawman payload of Constellation Pathfinder (CP). In our original CP design, the\nmagnetometer was affixed to a rigid boom in order to place it far enough away from sources of\nmagnetic clutter produced by the spacecraft electronics and solar panels (see Figure 1). As we\nanticipate launching many of these in a single launch the overall mechanical design is driven by\npackaging concerns and thermal constraints. Several nanosatellites are envisioned to rest on a\nsingle ejection post, hence the need for a hole at the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s center of gravity. Encapsulated\nsprings provide the axial thrust needed to sequentially separate the individual spacecraft from a\nmother ship; these springs also provide the secondary benefits of nutation damping. Thermal\ncontrol coatings and good thermal design are important considerationswith this craft which has a\nmuch larger surface-area-to-volumeratio than traditional spacecraft and which must tolerate\nmoderately long eclipses.\n\nFigure 1.View of the original CP nanosatellite design, showing the digital magnetometer at the\nend of a rigid boom, a deployable RF antenna, spring ejection system, battery boxes,\nelectronics box, and cold gas thrusters.\n\nIn order to maximize packing of the nanosatellites, we explored the feasibility of an\nextensible boom with this study. The design we chose was based on the concept of nested cups,\nin this case the cross section being polygonal in order to maintain position knowledge in the\nazimuthal direction. A mould was constructed of the appropriate length and diameter; the mould\nhad a slight taper. This mould was used to first lay up a G-10 fiberglass boom (see Figure 2,\nleft). After being freed fi-om the mould, the hollow fiberglass boom was sectioned into eight\nsegments and nested (see Figure 2, right). When stowed, the boom was only a few inches long.\nWhen deployed, the boom possessed a desired length equal to the diameter of the spacecraft.\nThe spin-up mechanism of the spacecraft would produce the centripetal force needed to deploy\nthe boom. Upon completion of the fiberglass boom, a second boom was constructed using\ncarbon fiber to improve rigidity and strength. Engineering drawings of the stowed and extended\nbooms are included in the lee panels of Figure 3; the boom connected to the nanosatellite\nstructure is shown in the right panel. We conclude that this design may be sufficient for missions\nrequiring only crude magnetometer pointing requirements (such as those at fairly high altitudes)\nbut would not be sufficient for missions requiring stringent directional information, such as those\nat lower altitudes.\nFigure\n\nm mould (right).\n\n--\n\nFigure 3. Boom shown in\nstowed, extended, and as\nattached to nanosatellite\nconfiguration.\n\n2\n\nSpacecraft structure desim and manufacturability\n\nA considerable issue with the deployment of a fleet of nanosatellites is their\nmanufacturability. The traditional cycle time for building must be reduced greatly if we are to\nfield a large number of hand-built units. This applies to both electronics as well as mechanical\nstructure. With this in mind, we also explored the possibility of constructing a carbon fiber\nstructure. A mould was constructed from a hogged out piece of plastic in the hexagonal shape of\nthe nanosatellite body (see Figure 3). As before, a prototype spacecraft shell was made first from\nG-10, followed by one using carbon fiber. While the strength of this shell was found to be\nsufficient, and while this process was relatively easy to effect, the final outside surface was poor\nand required machining. That process was difficult and insufficient. Based on our experience,\nwe conclude that the advantages (including electrical) of using aluminum for spacecraft structure\noutweigh any advantages that might be gained by using composite materials.\n\nFigure 3.
