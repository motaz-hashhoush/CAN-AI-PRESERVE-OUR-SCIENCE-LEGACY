The combined use of GDCF and DCF to satisfy domain connectivity requirements for systems of overset grids is found to minimize both human and computational resources.", "title": "GDCF - An interactive approach to domain connectivity among systems of overset grids", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T01:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930061093, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mccann, Karen M."}, "organization": {"name": "Sterling Software; NASA, Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "62bd71a781fe497780aebce435083aac"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930061093, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Meakin, Robert L."}, "organization": {"name": "Overset Methods, Inc.; NASA, Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "44740f837e184345a8d2798eac185c95"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930061093, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930061093, "publisher": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "id": "b8f8a446460c42fea0e072cd7e5f45b0", "publicationName": "In: AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Conference, 11th, Orlando, FL, July 6-9, 1993, Technical Papers.
