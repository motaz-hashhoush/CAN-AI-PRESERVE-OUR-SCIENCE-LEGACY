The cost constraint as well as technical\nconstraints currently dictate use of monolithic or possibly particulate or whiskertoughened ceramics. Improvements in properties such as toughness, strength, lubricity, and durability may also be needed for specific applications. In addition,\ntechnology advances in life prediction and nondestructive evaluation are required.\nThese advances in technology will lead to very limited use of ceramics in noncritical\napplications in aerospace engines. For critical aerospace applications, an additional requirement is that the components display markedly improved toughness and\nnoncatastrophic or graceful fracture.

The first is a statistical reliability as illustrated in the figure. Ceramics typically display a broad\ndistribution of strengths. In the inspection approach to reliability, we would\nseparate unacceptable parts by NDE and proof testing and reject them. A more\nefficient and cost-effective approach lies in improved processing that increases\nstrength and yields no defects.\nWe define the second form of reliability as functional reliability because it relates\nto how well a component performs its function during system assembly and service.\nThus, factors such as fracture toughness, impact resistance, and failure mode\n(graceful versus catastrophic), which are governed by micro- and macrostructure,\nneed to be considered. Specifically, particulate and whisker phases can improve\nfracture toughness and continuous fiber additions can also provide a noncatastrophic\nfailure mechanism. This brings us into the realm of engineered microstructures,\ni.e., composites.\n\nAPPROACHES TO CERAMIC RELIABILITY\nIMPROVE THE PROCESS\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cINSPECT IN\xe2\x80\x9d THE QUALITY\n\n- INCLUSIONS I)\n- VOIDS & CRACKS\n- SURFACE FLAWS\n\nUNACCEPTABLEPARTS BY\nNDE AND PROOF TESTING\nAND REJECT THEM.\nREQUIREMENT\n\nQUALITYCONTROLAPPROACH\n0 EFFICIENT\nLOW COST\nRELIABLE\n\nINEFFICIENT\nCOSTLY\n\n1-108\n\nCURRENT NASA LEWIS MATERIALS EFFORTS\n- TOUGHENED CERAMICS Research is focused on Sic and Si3N4 because these materials offer the desired\ncombination of high-temperature strength, thermal shock resistance, and environmental\ndurability. We are concluding efforts on Sic and Si3N4 reliability improvement.\nFuture efforts are being focused on determining the potential of these materials for\nuse in the 1300 to 1600 OC range. This requires improvements in strength and toughness and an understanding of how these improvements translate into use potential.\nThese efforts are synergistic with our effort in fiber-reinforced ceramics where\nmuch of our emphasis is on Sic and Si3Nq materials.\n\nCURRENT NASA LEWIS MATERIALS EFFORTS\n-TOUGH ENED CERAMICs-\n\n-\n\nFOCUS: Sic & Si3N4 FOR USE POTENTIAL ABOVE 1300 "C\nRELIABILITY IMPROVEMENT\nIMPROVED Si3N4 HIGH-TEMPERATURE STRENGTH\nIMPROVED Sic & Si3N4 FRACTURE TOUGHNESS\n\nLIFE PREDICTION OF WHISKER-TOUGHENED Sic & Si3N4\n\nCD-87-28863\n\n1-109\n\nIMPROVED SILICON CARBIDE BY HOT-ISOSTATIC PRESSING\nSome recent progress at the NASA Lewis Research Center in improving the strength of\nsilicon carbide is illustrated. Materials fabricated by dry pressing or slurry\npressing, followed by sintering at 2200 OC for 30 min, have four-point flexural\nstrengths of about 345 and 414 MPa, respectively. Hot-isostatic pressing tantalumencapsulated, green, slurry-pressed specimens at 1900 OC for 30 min improves strength\nto about 552 MPa while achieving the same density. This densification at a much\nlower temperature yields a much finer grain size and a shift in the strength-limiting\nflaw from internal defects, such as pores and agglomerates, to surface machining\ndefects. Improvements are being sought to reduce sensitivity to surface flaws.\n\nIMPROVED SILICON CARBIDE BY HOT-ISOSTATIC PRESSING\nA\n\nB\n\nB\n400\n\nFLEXURE\nSTRENGTH, 3oo\n\nMPa\n\nt\n\n2ool\n\nC\n\n100\n\nLDRY\n\n-\n\n!

This gives stress-strain behavior that mimics a\nmetal and noncatastrophic or "graceful" failure. The penalty for doing this is\ngreater fabrication difficulty. Also, available fibers for high-temperature\n(1400 "C) ceramic matrix composites are limited, and the proper fiber-matrix bond\nmust be maintained in fabrication as well as during the life of the composite. Too\nstrong a bond yields a loss in toughness and a reversion to monolithic ceramic\nbehavior, while too weak a bond yields loss in stiffness, strength, and toughness.\n\nFIBER-REINFORCED CERAMICS APPROACH\nTO RELIABILITY\nINCORPORATE CONTINUOUS CERAMIC FILAMENTS HAVING\nGREATER STIFFNESS THAN MATRIX\nADVANTAGES\nIMPROVED TOUGHNESS IMPARTED BY CRACK DEFLECTION\nAND CRACK BRIDGING\nINCREASED MODULUS AND STRESS TO FAILURE\n"METAL LIKE" STRESSSTRAIN BEHAVIOR\nGRACEFUL FAILURE\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nDISADVANTAGES\nPROCESSING MORE DIFFICULT\nAVAILABLE FIBERS LIMITED\nCONTROL OF FIBER-MATRIX BOND REQUIRED\n\n-\n\nCD-87-28867\n\n1-113\n\nGRACEFUL FAILURE OF CERAMIC COMPOSITES\nReinforcing with ceramic fibers having a modulus and ultimate strength greater than\nthe monolithic ceramic used as the matrix material yields ceramic composites with\ngreater stiffness and greater strength at first matrix cracking. If small diameter\nfibers are used, matrix crack propagation can be delayed by the bridging mechanism\ndepicted in the figure insert. This results in matrix failure for the composite at\na stress and strain level higher than for the monolithic ceramic. If the fibermatrix interfacial bonding is optimum, matrix cracks propagate around the fibers and\nnot through them. Once matrix cracks start to form, they occur at a regular spacing.\nThe ceramic is then held together by the load-carrying capacity of the fibers until\nthey begin to fracture in a statistical manner. The net result for a tough ceramic\ncomposite having an optimum bond between the matrix and fiber is that a metallike\nstress-strain curve is displayed with first-matrix cracking stress corresponding to\nthe yield stress of metals and fiber fracture corresponding to the ultimate strength.\n\nGRACEFUL FAILURE OF CERAMIC COMPOSITES\nFIBER BRIDGING OF MATRIX CRACKS\n\nSTRESS\n\nNREINFORCED\n\nSTRAIN\nCD-87-28868\n\nmrmiw, PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n1-114\n\nCURRENT NASA LEWIS MATERIALS EFFORTS\n\n-\n\n-\n\nFiber-Reinforced Ceramics\n\n-\n\nThe focus of current NASA Lewis research in fiber-reinforced ceramics (FRC) is on\nthe development of fabrication approaches that yield good matrix properties and can\nbe carried out with minimal degradation of fiber strength. Four approaches that are\nbeing pursued are outlined. Extension of the capability of FRC via development of\nadvanced fibers and fiber coatings is a second area of focus. The third area of\nfocus is assessment of FRC capability to perform in applications such as NASP and\nrocket propulsion systems. These efforts thus focus on key issues associated with\neach application, such as process scale-up to enable component fabrication, compatibility with the environment, and resistance to thermal shock.\n\nCURRENT NASA LEWIS MATERIALS EFFORTS\n-FIBER-REINFORCED CERAMICS1.

Silicon\nand Sic fiber monotapes are interleaved and subjected to a mild hot-pressing step to\nburn out the binder and provide some green strength. The composite is then nitrided\nto convert the silicon to Si3N4. The resultant composite microstructure contains\nhigh levels of porosity, particularly between fibers. In four-point flexural\ntesting, the composite exhibits a first-matrix cracking strength comparable to\ntypical monolithic RBSN even though the matrix density at 2.0 gm/cm3 is far lower\nthan that of monolithic RBSN. The ultimate strength of the composite is more than\ntwice that of a typical RBSN at both 23 and 40 percent fiber loading.\n\nSic FIBERS STRENGTHEN AND TOUGHEN REACTION-BONDED Si3N4\nSILICON\nSLURRY\nS i c /Si\nPREFORM\n\n- HOT PRESS -\n\nSIC\nFIBER\n\nMATRIX CRACKING\n\n800\n\nMICRO STRUCTURE\n\n600\nBEND\nSTRESS,\nMPa\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0I\n\n2.6\n\n2.0\n2.2\nDENSITY, gm /cc\n\n2.4\nCD-87-28870\n\n1-116\n\nSiC/RBSN COMPOSITES FRACTURE GRACEFULLY\n\n4\n\nTensile stress-strain data and fracture behavior of 30 vol % SiC/RBSN composites are\nillustrated in this figure.

The fracture surface exhibits the moderate fiber pullout required\nfor achieving a strong, tough ceramic matrix composite. It is expected that with\nthe development of high strength, smaller diameter Sic fibers, the fracture properties of the SiC/RBSN will improve significantly.\n\na\n\nSiC/RBSN COMPOSITES FRACTURE GRACEFULLY\nROOM-TEMPERATURE TENSILE STRESS-STRAIN\nBEHAVIOR FOR SiClRBSN COMPOSITE LAMINATES\n\nFRACTURED SPECIMEN\n\n-\n\n(vf 0.3)\nUTS\n\n, UNREINFORCED RBSN\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nAXIAL STRAIN,\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nI\n\n0.7\n\nO\nI/\nCD-07-28671\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nOF POOR QUALIW\n1-117\n\nHIGH-TEMPERATURE STRENGTH OF SiC/RBSN COMPOSITES\nBETTER THAN COMMERCIAL CERAMICS\nFour-point bend strengths for SiC/RBSN at room temperature, 1200 OC (2200 OF) and\n1400 OC (2550 OF) are compared with data for fully dense, hot-pressed Si3N4, reactionbonded Si3N4, and SEP SiC/SiC composite (one-dimensional).

Results are summarized in the\ngraph. Treatment at 1360 atm in argon results in about a 300 OC increase in the\nmaximum exposure temperature for onset of strength degradation. This effect is\ntransitory in nature. Thus, exposure to high temperature at 1 atm after pressure\ntreatment gives the same results as exposure of a nontreated fiber. However, if\nhigh-temperature exposure is necessary only for processing of the composite, the\npressure treatment approach has significant merit.\n\nHIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS PROCESSING WINDOW\nFOR CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITES\nPROCESS\nb\n\nI\n\nPROCESS TO\nCERAMIC COMPOSITE\nAT 1200 "C AT 1 atm\n\n1200 "C AT 1 atm\n\nPRESSURE\nPROCESS\n\nPROCESS TO 1500\n-AT HIGH PRESSURE"C\n\nI\n\n-\n\nSTRONG, TOUGH\nCOMPOSITE\nPOSSIBLE BECAUSE\n\nHIGH PRESSURE PROCESSING MAINTAINS NICALON SIC\nFIBER STRENGTH TO HIGHER TEMPERATURES\n\n1500\n\nTENSILE\nSTRENGTH, 1DM\nMPa\n\nc\n1360 alm AROON\n\nCD-07-20073\n\nTEMPERATURE, "C\n\n1-1 19\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nFor ceramics to achieve their promise, reliable and economical fabrication processes\nmust be developed for monolithic, whisker-toughened, and fiber-reinforced ceramics.\nIn addition, a basic understanding of the materials science of ceramics is required\nto enable the development of the processing and of the design and life prediction\nmethodologies that will enable them t o be utilized.\n\nMATERIAL CLASS\nTOUGHENED CERAMICS\n\nKEY TECHNOLOGIES\nRELIABLE FABRICATION\n\nMATERIALS\n\nLIFE PREDICTION\nFIBER-REINFORCED CERAMICS\n\nSCIENCE\nFOUNDATION\n\nADVANCED FIBERS AND COATINGS\nFABRICATION\nLIFE PREDICTION\n\nSCIENCE\nFOUNDATlON\n\nCD-07-28874\n\n1-120\n\n'
