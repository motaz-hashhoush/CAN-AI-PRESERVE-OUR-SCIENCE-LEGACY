b'Supply-Chain Optimization Template\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe Supply-Chain Optimization Template (SCOT) is an instructional guide\nfor identifying, evaluating, and optimizing (including re-engineering) aerospace-oriented supply chains. The\nSCOT was derived from the Supply\nChain Council\xe2\x80\x99s Supply-Chain Operations Reference (SCC SCOR) Model,\nwhich is more generic and more oriented toward achieving a competitive\nadvantage in business.\nUtilizing NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Parachute Refurbishment Facility as an example, concepts\n\ncontained in the SCC SCOR Model were\nmodified and expanded to be applicable\nto the unique processes, restrictions,\nand regulations found in aerospace environments. Templates of the optimized\nprocesses were created, samples were developed, and validated effective\nprocesses of implementation were created. These templates, samples, and\nprocesses were integrated into a formal\nstep-by-step set of descriptions of only\nthose processes applicable in aerospace\nsettings. The inclusion of these specific\n\nprocess steps, coupled with the exclusion of generic SCC SCOR Model\nprocess steps that are not applicable in\naerospace settings, is expected to reduce\nthe amounts of time needed to both optimize supply chains and train personnel\nto optimize supply chains.\nThis work was done by William F.

MSC-23423-1\n\nAlgorithm for Computing Particle/Surface Interactions\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nAn algorithm has been devised for\npredicting the behaviors of sparsely spatially distributed particles impinging on\na solid surface in a rarefied atmosphere.\nUnder the stated conditions, prior particle-transport models in which (1) dense\ndistributions of particles are treated as\ncontinuum fluids; or (2) sparse distributions of particles are considered to be\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, December 2009\n\nsuspended in and to diffuse through\nfluid streams are not valid.\nIn the present algorithm, individual\nparticle/surface interactions are modeled. The algorithm uses a few key parameters that can be determined experimentally for the particles of interest in a given\napplication: These parameters are the coefficient of restitution, coefficient of trans-\n\nfer of momentum, diffusivity, and sticking\nvelocity. If many representative particles\nare tracked through modeling by use of\nthis algorithm, a statistically likely distribution of particles can be obtained.\nThis work was done by David W.
