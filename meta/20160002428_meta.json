To date, each of the five space-craft attitude control system (ACS) modes have been operating as expected and meeting all guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) requirements, although since launch, several anomalies were encountered. While unplanned, these anomalies have proven to be invaluable in developing a deeper understanding of the ACS, and drove the design of three alterations to the ACS task of the flight software (FSW). An overview of the GN&C subsystem hardware, including re-furbishment, and ACS architecture are introduced, followed by a chronological discussion of key events, flight performance, as well as anomalies encountered by the GN&C team.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160002428, "endDate": "2016-02-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronautical Society", "location": "Breckenridge, CO, United States"}}, "meetingId": "d462b5816df347338becda59f1ca045a", "id": "c37b1f34b8c64363bc189fc574bab574"}], "name": "AAS Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference", "location": "Breckenridge, CO", "id": "d462b5816df347338becda59f1ca045a", "startDate": "2016-02-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160002428, "id": "e9f22057a5924b58a2a3020d578e5a13", "publicationDate": "2016-02-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20160001692, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Launch and Commissioning of the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR)", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160002428.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160002428/downloads/20160002428.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160002428/downloads/20160002428.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160002428/downloads/20160002428.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
