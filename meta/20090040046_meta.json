The instrument at an earlier stage of development was reported in Optoelectronic Instrument Monitors pH in a Culture Medium (MSC-23107), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 28, No. 9 (September 2004), page 4a. To recapitulate: The instrument includes a quartz cuvette through which the medium flows as it is circulated through a bioreactor. The medium contains some phenol red, which is an organic pH-indicator dye. The cuvette sits between a light source and a photodetector. [The light source in the earlier version comprised red (625 nm) and green (558 nm) light-emitting diodes (LEDs); the light source in the present version comprises a single green- (560 nm)-or-red (623 nm) LED.] The red and green are repeatedly flashed in alternation. The responses of the photodiode to the green and red are processed electronically to obtain the ratio between the amounts of green and red light transmitted through the medium. The optical absorbance of the phenol red in the green light varies as a known function of pH. Hence, the pH of the medium can be calculated from the aforesaid ratio.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090040046, "id": "80429ee232274222b84e545541cea53d", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, November 2009", "publicationDate": "2009-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20090040043, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, November 2009", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090040046.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090040046/downloads/20090040046.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090040046/downloads/20090040046.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090040046/downloads/20090040046.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
