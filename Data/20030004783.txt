b'Fire Protection\n\nMaterials\n\nPlunging into Earth\'s atmosphere\non return from\nspace, the Apollo Command Module encountered\nfriction temperatures\nas high as 5,000 degrees\nFahrenheit\non its exterior surfaces--yet\nthe interior\nremained cool. The reason was the spacecraft\'s\nheat\nshield, coated with an "ablative"\nmaterial applied\nto external surfaces. The material was allowed to\nburn and thereby dissipate heat energy; in addition,\nthe burned material charred to form a protective\ncoating which blocked heat penetration\nbeyond the\nouter surface. The heat shield was designed and\nbuilt by Avco Corporation,\nwhich subsequently-under a contract\nwith Ames Research\nCenter--applied\nthe heat shield technology\nto the\nfield of fire protection,\nspecifically in development\nof fire-retardant\npaints and foams for aircraft and\nother applications.\nAvco has also drawn upon its heat shield\nexperience\nto develop a number of widely-accepted\ncommercial\nfire protection\nmaterials, produced\nby\nAvco Specialty Materials Division, Lowell,\nMassachusetts.\nOne such material is Chartek \xc2\xae 59\nfireproofing,\nan intumescent\nepoxy coating\nspecifically designed for outdoor use by industrial\nfacilities dealing with highly flammable products-oil refineries and chemical plants, for example.\nThe coating is applied--usually\nby spray gun as\nshown at right--to\nexterior structural steel, conduits,\npipes and valves, offshore platforms and liquefied\npetroleum gas tanks, such as the one shown below.\nIn the presence of fire, Chartek 59 fireproofing\nprovides two types of protection:\nablation, or\ndissipation of heat by burnoff, and "intumescence,"\nor swelling; the coating swells to about five times\nits original size, forming a protective blanket of char\nwhich retards transfer of heat to the metal structure.\n\nThis prevents loss of structural strength and possible\ncollapse which would compound\nthe fire-fighting\nproblem. Chartek 59 fireproofing\noffers a bonus:\nbecause it is non-porous,\nit also serves as a superior\nanti-corrosion\ncoating.\nThe technology\ndeveloped\nfor NASA provided a\nfoundation\nfor several other fire protection\nproducts:\nFire-Flex \xc2\xae intumescent\ntape for protective\nwrapping\nof fuel lines, tubes and cables; Thermarest\n\xc2\xaefoams\nfor thermal insulation;\nand Flamarest \xc2\xae_\ncoatings, a\nline of intumescent\npaints for a broad variety\nof applications.\n(R_Chartek,\ntrademarks\n\nFire-Flex,\nof Avco\n\nThermarest\nCorporation.\n\nand\n\nFlamarest\n\nare\n\nre_:istered\n\n'
