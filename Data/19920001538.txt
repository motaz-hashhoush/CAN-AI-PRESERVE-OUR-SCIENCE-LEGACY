Isbell, U.S. Geological\nArizona 86001\n\nSurvey,\n\nFlagstaff,\n\nMuch has been learned about the Valles Marineris, and stratigraphic relations inside the troughs\nhave been reasonably well established.\nHowever, many questions remain, especially questions\npertaining to tectonism and origin.\nWhat is the age of the troughs?\nThe central Valles Marineris troughs disrupted\n\nlavas of Lunae and Syria\n\nPlana of Early Hesperian\n\nage [1]. Accordingly,\nthey may be as old as Early Hesperian.\nThe Noctis Labyrinthus troughs, which\ndisrupted Upper Hesperian or Amazonian lavas [2], may be of Early Amazonian age. An analysis of\nshallow grabens that parallel the Valles Marineris and of wrinkle ridges that trend perpendicular\nto them\nsuggests that wrinkle ridges developed first, grabens second [3,4], and the Valles Marineris\neither at the\nsame time as the grabens or last [5,6], all perhaps in Early Hesperian\ntime.\nInterior layered deposits were emplaced on top of chaotic materials in the eastern and northern\ntroughs that merge with outflow channels of middle to Late Hesperian age. Therefore\nthese troughs are\nat least as old as the channels, but the deposits are younger.\nGeologic relations suggest that some troughs may be split lengthwise into older segments filled by\ninterior layered deposits and younger segments that are devoid of interior layered deposits and locally\nexpose former plateau materials on their floors [7]. Hebes Chasma and the southern parts of Ophir,\neastern Candor, and Melas Chasmata appear to be older, as are the peripheral\ntroughs that merge with\noutflow channels.\nThe northern parts of Ophir and eastern Candor Chasmata are younger, as may be\nthe entire length of the Ins and Tithonium, central Melas, and Coprates Chasmata system [8]. Overall,\nthe opening of the troughs\nto Amazonian.\n\nseems\n\nto have had several episodes,\n\nextending\n\nin time from Early Hesperian\n\nWhat is the evidence for tectonic origin?\nBlasius et al. [9] advocated a tectonic origin for the troughs, because they lie on the flanks of the\nTharsis rise and are radial to its center, are paralleled by grabens, and are bounded by fault scarps\nhaving triangular facets on truncated spurs.\nYet, an erosional origin remained attractive because of an\napparent morphologic continuum between pit chains of probable erosional origin and large troughs.\nA\nrecent morphometrie\nstudy comparing the width-to-depth relations of all the depressions\nin the area [10]\nshowed that a continuum between pit chains and large troughs does not exist, suggesting that the large\ntroughs probably formed through deep-seated coherent failure. However,\nour work in progress shows\nthat erosional back wasting from fault scarps on the major troughs may have played a significant role.\nThirty-two percent of the area of the troughs is attributable to such erosion.\ndigital terrain model of the troughs to calculate the volumes of the materials\nHow\n\ndo the Valles\n\nMarineris\n\nrelate\n\nto the Tharsis\n\nWe are currently using a\nremoved from the walls.\n\nrise?\n\nGeophysical models indicate that isostatic adjustment of the Tharsis rise would have caused\ncircumferential\ntensile stresses in the western part of the Valles Marineris, whereas external loading\n(flexing the dastic lithosphere downward) would have caused such stresses in the eastern chasmata [ 1115]. Thus, these stress models require two distinct events.\nThe different ages of the troughs as\noutlined above do not agree with an age difference between western and eastern troughs.\nPerhaps local\nstructural\ninhomogeneities\nThe Valles Marineris\n\nperturbed\nthe regional stress system.\nare paralleled by shallow, east-trending\n\ngrabens that are part of graben\n\nsystems radial to Tharsis.\nHowever,\nthe sector north of the Valles Marineris is almost devoid of such\ngrabens.\nIt appears that the Tharsis stresses at Valles Marineris were released by a few major, deep\nfaults rather than by distributed shear.\n\n75\n\nThe structural relief of the Valles\n\nMarineris,\n\nwhich is 8-10 km throughout\n\nthe central troughs,\n\ndecreases uniformly eastward to 3-5 km in Coprates Chssma.\nThis decrease would indicate less strain\ntoward the outer periphery of the Tharsis rise, but the stress models do not predict this decrease.\nThe\ndiscrepancy is not yet explained.\nThe amount of strain on the Valles Marineris also depends on the attitude of fault planes.\nCart [16]\npostulated near-vertical planes, whereas Golombek and Davis [17] found planes with dips near 60 \xc2\xb0.\nWe are currently studying fault-plane attitudes by mapping fault traces on stereophotogrammetric\nmodels\n\nacross areas of high relief.\n\nWhat additional\nfactors my have influenced\nthe origin of the Valles Marineris?\nCarr [16] mentioned that the location of the troughs may be related to subterranean aquifers.\n4-km contour on the plateau adjacent to the Valles Marineris coincides approximately\nwith the\n\nThe\n\nappearance of chaotic materials in the eastern (Capri, Eos, and Gangis) and northern (Juventae)\nchasmata that merge with channels.\nThis observation suggests that an aquifer is intersected\nnear the 4km-elevation\nhorizon. Perhaps subterranean\nwater, transported from the Thersis center toward the\noutflow channels along the Valles Marineris, may have increased the pore pressures and lowered the\nstrength\nThe\neastward\nthe crest\n\nof the crust, permitting\nfailure to occur more readily.\nValles Marineris lie along the crest of a regional, elongated topographic\nbulge extending\nfrom Tharsis.\nWise et al. [18] suggested that the troughs represent a "key-stone" collapse\nof this bulge, formed by the extension accompanying\narching.\nAlternatively,\nthe elongated\n\nof\n\nbulge may have formed from isostatic rebound after trough formation.\nAnother explanation\nfor both\narching and rifting is aborted plate tectonism [19]. However, most terrestrial rif_ have many parallel\nfaults in en echelon patterns that taper out along strike, and the rifted beds are tilted. By contrast, the\nValles Marineris faults are more widely spaced, trough ends are blunt, fault planes appear to be steep,\nand tilted beds are relatively few. Perhaps the difference is due to a thicker or more homogeneous\ncrust on Mars than commonly\n\noccurs in rift zones on Earth [19].\n\nReferences:\n[1] Scott, D.H., and Tanaka, K.L. 1986. U.S. Geol.
