TSA has demonstrated multi-octave bandwidth, moderate gain (7 to 10 dB), and symmetric E- and H- plane beam patterns and can be used for many different applications. This chapter summarizes the research activities on notch antennas over the past decade with emphasis on their most recent advances and applications. This chapter begins with some discussions on the designs of single TSA; then follows with detailed discussions of issues associated with TSA designs and performance characteristics. To conclude the chapter, some recent developments in TSA arrays and their applications are highlighted.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040086782, "id": "f7da478165fc4ebc9c8d17b0f1162536", "publicationDate": "2004-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040086782.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040086782/downloads/20040086782.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040086782/downloads/20040086782.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040086782/downloads/20040086782.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
