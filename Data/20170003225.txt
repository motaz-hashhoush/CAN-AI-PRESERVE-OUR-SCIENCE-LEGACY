The impact of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Arctic Dipole (AD) on the radiative flux into the Arctic mean\natmospheric column is quantified. 3-month-averaged AO and AD indices are regressed with corresponding surface and\ntop-of-atmosphere (TOA) fluxes from the CERES-SFC and CERES-TOA EBAF datasets over the period 2000-2014. An\nincrease in clear-sky fluxes into the Arctic mean atmospheric column during fall is the largest net flux anomaly associated\nwith AO, primarily driven by a positive net longwave flux anomaly (i.e. increase of net flux into the atmospheric column)\nat the surface. A decrease in the Arctic mean atmospheric column cloud radiative effect during winter and spring is the\nlargest flux anomaly associated with AD, primarily driven by a change in the longwave cloud radiative effect at the surface.\nThese prominent responses to AO and AD are widely distributed across the ice-covered Arctic, suggesting that the physical\nprocess or processes that bring about the flux change associated with AO and AD are distributed throughout the Arctic.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe net radiative flux into the atmospheric column at the top and bottom of the atmosphere is a crucial component\nof the energy budget of the Arctic atmosphere, as part of the overall Arctic energy balance.1 The magnitude of the\nradiative flux at the top and bottom of the Arctic atmospheric column is affected by changes in cloud properties (i.e.\ncloud radiative effects), as well as changes within the atmospheric column independent of clouds (i.e. clear-sky\neffects). At the surface, longwave and shortwave flux anomalies are a primary mechanism by which atmospheric\nvariability interacts with the surface energy budget, and subsequently sea ice variability during both the melt and\nfreeze-up of sea ice.2,3 Changes in the characteristics of clouds and the atmospheric column have been linked to largescale atmospheric variability in the Arctic. Arctic large-scale atmospheric variability is characterized by preferred\nmodes, or patterns, of variability. Two such patterns are the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Arctic Dipole (AD).4,5 Both\nthe AO and AD have been linked to atmospheric temperature and water vapor content anomalies and cloud vertical\nand horizontal distribution and thus have the potential to affect surface and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes.6\nGiven the potential and established links between atmospheric variability and radiative fluxes in Arctic\natmospheric column, the purpose of this paper is to quantify the impacts of AO and AD on longwave and shortwave\nradiative fluxes at the top and bottom of the Arctic atmospheric column in all seasons. The results presented are a first\nstep toward better understanding the physical mechanism that links large-scale atmospheric variability to changes in\nthe Arctic energy budget.\n\nDATA AND METHODS\nFor all surface and TOA radiative flux quantities, we use NASA Clouds and the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s Radiant Energy System\nEnergy Balanced and Filled monthly data (CERES EBAF-Surface[TOA]_Ed2.8), on a 1-degree latitude by 1-degree\nlongitude grid.7 Both the AO and AD are circulation patterns defined as the result of the application of principal\n\ncomponent analysis on Northern Hemisphere sea level pressure and near-surface geopotential height. The AO is\ndefined as the leading empirical function (EOF) of 1000 mb geopotential height north of 20\xc2\xb0N latitude.8 We use the\nmonthly AO index from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). The AD is defined as the second EOF of 1000mb\ngeopotential height north of 70\xc2\xb0N latitude.9 We calculate the AD index using this definition and NCEP-NCAR\nreanalysis data.10\nTo capture the seasonal response of the surface and TOA fluxes, we regress the 3-month average atmospheric\ncolumn fluxes with corresponding 3-month-average AO and AD indices at each grid point in the CERES-EBAF data\nover the 2000-2014 period. The atmospheric column flux is the sum of the net incoming flux at TOA and net upward\nflux at the surface, and is directly related to the heating or cooling of the atmospheric column. 1 To account for the\ninherent trend in some of the flux quantities over this period (e.g. upwelling shortwave flux) and focus on the\ninterannual variability, we detrend the CERES-EBAF data before regressing with the AO and AD indices.\n\nRESULTS\nWe present the Arctic mean net clear-sky flux and cloud radiative effect anomalies associated with the Arctic\nOscillation (AO) and Arctic Dipole (AD) for each 3-month averaging period (DJF: winter, December-February,\nMAM: spring, March-May, JJA: summer, June-August, SON: fall, September-November) in Table 1. Positive\n(negative) values indicate a net flux into (out of) the atmospheric column that warms (cools) the column. The largest\nmagnitude net radiative flux anomaly associated with the AO is found in the fall (SON), with a clear-sky net flux\nincrease of 2.5 W m-2. An associated positive clear-sky flux anomaly also exists in winter, and an associated negative\nclear-sky flux anomaly exists in summer. The cloud radiative effect associated with AO is near zero or positive in all\nseasons, with the largest associated cloud effect in spring. Overall, the all-sky mean response to AO, which is the sum\nof the associated clear-sky flux and cloud radiative effect anomalies, is positive in all seasons except for summer,\nmeaning that the total radiative flux anomalies associated with a positive AO index tend to warm the Arctic mean\natmospheric column.\nTABLE 1. Arctic-average net clear-sky flux anomalies and net cloud radiative effect (CRE) anomalies for the atmospheric\ncolumn, associated with 3-month averaged AO and AD indices from 2000-2014 (units: W m-2). Arctic average is defined as\nall areas north of 65 degrees North latitude. Associated anomalies are determined by linear regression between time series of\n3-month-averaged CERES-EBAF fluxes and 3-month-averaged AO/AD indices. Positive (negative) numbers refer to net\nwarming (cooling) of the atmospheric column by corresponding net radiative flux anomalies.\n\nDJF\nFlux\nType\nAO\nAD\n\nDJF\n\nMAM\n\nMAM\n\nJJA\n\nJJA\n\nSON\n\nSON\n\nClear-Sky\n\nCRE\n\nClear-Sky\n\nCRE\n\nClear-Sky\n\nCRE\n\nClear-Sky\n\nCRE\n\n1.17\n-0.54\n\n-0.05\n-1.62\n\n0.06\n1.33\n\n0.73\n-2.52\n\n-1.78\n-0.30\n\n0.07\n0.57\n\n2.46\n0.62\n\n0.54\n-0.76\n\nCompared to the AO, the cloud radiative effect anomalies associated with AD are much more dominant than the\nassociated clear-sky anomalies in the Arctic average. A positive AD index is associated with a negative net column\ncloud radiative effect anomaly in all seasons outside of summer. The magnitude of the AO-associated spring cloud\nradiative effect anomaly is of similar magnitude as the AO-associated clear-sky flux anomaly in fall. The large\nnegative cloud effect anomaly in spring is counteracted partially by the clear-sky flux response, thus the largest allsky atmospheric column response to AD is in winter (-2.2 W m-2). Opposite to the AO, a positive AD in all seasons\nbut summer results in a net all-sky flux out of the atmospheric column and a cooling of the Arctic mean atmospheric\ncolumn.\nWe now breakdown the total net clear-sky and cloud radiative effect anomalies into longwave (LW) and shortwave\n(SW) components, and further separate by surface and TOA in Fig. 1, to find the component that most contributes the\nlargest clear-sky flux and cloud radiative effect anomalies shown in Table 1. The large AO-associated clear-sky flux\nanomaly is primarily due to a positive net LW flux at the surface (i.e. an increased net LW flux into the column at the\nsurface), with minor contributions from net LW flux at TOA and net SW flux at the surface (Fig. 1a). Net LW flux\nanomalies at the surface also primarily contribute to the total positive net clear-sky flux in winter and to the total\nnegative net clear-sky flux in summer. There is much cancellation between components in the AO-associated cloud\nradiative effect anomalies (Fig. 1b), explaining the small Arctic mean cloud effect values.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFIGURE 1. Net shortwave and longwave flux components of the Arctic-average (north of 65\xc2\xb0N) net column radiative flux\nassociated with AO and AD (units: W m-2). Clear-sky components are shown in panels a) and c) and cloud radiative flux\ncomponents are shown in panels b) and d).\n\nLike the AO-associated Arctic mean cloud radiative effect anomalies, there is much cancellation between\ncomponents in the AD-associated clear-sky flux anomalies (Fig. 1c). The largest clear-sky response to AD in spring\nis primarily driven by anomalous clear sky net LW fluxes at the surface and anomalous net TOA SW fluxes. The large\nAD-associated cloud radiative effect anomalies in winter and spring are primarily driven by large negative net surface\nLW fluxes, partially counteracted by smaller positive net LW TOA flux anomalies (Fig. 1d). In the summer and fall,\nthe cloud radiative effect response is of much smaller magnitude.\nThe greatest difference between the largest AO- and AD-associated anomalies are that the largest AO-associated\nanomalies are clear-sky flux anomalies, while the largest AD-associated anomalies are cloud radiative effect\nanomalies. In both cases, the largest seasonal responses to AO and AD involve LW fluxes.\nThe AO-associated column net positive clear-sky LW anomalies are distributed across most of the Arctic (Fig.\n2a). Exceptions include the ice-free parts of the Arctic east of Greenland and north of Scandinavia. For the ADassociated longwave cloud radiative effect response in spring, the negative response is similarly distributed across\nmost of the ice-covered portions of the Arctic (Fig. 2b). The widespread coverage of regression values that match the\nsign of the mean Arctic response in both cases hint that the physical process or processes that bring about the flux\nchange are distributed throughout the Arctic. Additionally, Fig. 2 shows that the Arctic mean is not dominated by very\nlarge flux responses in a limited region of the Arctic.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 2. a) Atmospheric column clear sky net LW flux anomaly associated with SON AO index over 2000-2014 (units: W\nm-2). b) Same as panel a), but longwave cloud radiative effect anomaly associated with the MAM AD index is shown.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nBy regressing CERES-EBAF seasonal-mean (i.e. DJF, MAM, JJA, and SON) flux data at the surface and the top\nof atmosphere with the corresponding mean Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Arctic Dipole (AD) indices, we determined\nthe flux anomalies linearly associated with AO and AD in each season. We presented the results as the change in flux\ninto the atmospheric column, directly related to the heating and cooling of the atmospheric column.\nThe largest magnitude atmospheric column clear-sky flux or cloud radiative effect anomaly associated with AO is\nfound in fall (2.5 W m-2, Table 1). The primary contributor to this positive flux anomaly is the net surface LW flux,\nwith minor contributions from the net TOA LW flux and net surface SW flux (Figs. 1a and 1b). The largest associated\nclear-sky or cloud radiative effect anomaly associated with AD is in spring (-2.5 W m-2, Table 1), primarily driven by\nthe surface LW cloud radiative effect anomaly (Fig. 1d). The spatial distribution of these largest associated anomalies\n(Fig. 2) reveal that same-signed anomalies are found throughout the ice-covered part of the Arctic region. These results\nshow the dominance of LW flux anomalies associated with AO and AD. A question for future work and a topic of a\nforthcoming paper is what physical processes lead to these LW flux anomalies.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nFunding for B.M.
