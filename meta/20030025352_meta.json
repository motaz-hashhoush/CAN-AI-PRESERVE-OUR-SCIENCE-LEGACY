Internet protocols and technologies are under study as a future means to provide seamless dynamic communication among heterogeneous instruments, spacecraft, ground stations, constellations of spacecraft, and science investigators. The primary objective is to design and demonstrate in the laboratory the automated end-to-end transport of files in a simulated dynamic space environment using off-the-shelf, low-cost, commodity-level standard applications and protocols. The demonstrated functions and capabilities will become increasingly significant in the years to come as both earth and space science missions fly more sensors and the present labor-intensive, mission-specific techniques for processing and routing data become prohibitively. This paper describes how an IP-based communication architecture can support all existing operations concepts and how it will enable some new and complex communication and science concepts. The authors identify specific end-to-end data flows from the instruments to the control centers and scientists, and then describe how each data flow can be supported using standard Internet protocols and applications. The scenarios include normal data downlink and command uplink as well as recovery scenarios for both onboard and ground failures. The scenarios are based on an Earth orbiting spacecraft with downlink data rates from 300 Kbps to 4 Mbps. Included examples are based on designs currently being investigated for potential use by the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030025352, "endDate": "2002-10-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Telemetering Conference 2002", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "dc6595e51f0844d3bc11f431c9593ad1", "startDate": "2002-10-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030025352, "id": "9761ee7cbcb94f7ca3f4865c7d9e0a0f", "publicationDate": "2002-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030025352.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030025352/downloads/20030025352.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030025352/downloads/20030025352.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030025352/downloads/20030025352.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
