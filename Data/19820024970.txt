The reconfigured, third-generation design embodied\n72 three-inch diameter cells, which were connected in a six parallel by\ntwelve series cell matrix. Figure 1.1 depicts the overall module layout.\nThis design utilizes Czochralski (CZ) silicon cells with redundant acrossthe-cell copper ribbons. The encapulation system consists of a low-iron\ntempered glass superstrate and Tedlar*-aluminum foil-Tedlar backside\nmoisture barrier that is thereto-vacuum laminated with polyvinyl butyral\n(PVB). Edge sealing was accomplished with lead foil tape. The lead tape\nwas overcoated with polyester to increase circuit to case isolation. The\nlaminate was then encased in a gasketed aluminum extrusion frame. The\ninitial aluminum extrusion corner construction, which utilized a barred\nsteel retainer clip, was modified to include stainless steel rivets.\nAddition of the rivets was necessary to maintain structural integrity\nduring temperature cycling.\nA one-piece gasket was selected after intermittant success in attaining the required circuit-to-case isolation. This formed gasket provides a\ncomplete and repeatable dielectric at each of the four corners, and thus\ninsures that the designed circuit-case isolation is maintained.\nAMP "SOLAR-LOK" terminals were utilized in the final design, for ease\nof module-to-module field connects, and to facilitate use of external bypass diodes.\nThe final Photowatt third-generation, intermediate load module design\npassed the JPL Block IV qualifications tests with an average power degration\nof +.5 per cent. The average power output of the qualification modules\nis 38.15 watts (100 MW/CM , 28c). This equates to 6.7 watts per square\nfoot of total module area. The following sections provide a detailed\ndescription of the module and pertinent results of program design reviews\nand qualification testing.\n\n2.0 Technical Discussion\nThe third-generation intermediate load module was Photowatt\'s initial\ndesign in which a thermo-vacuum lamination process was utilized and that\nthe solar cell circuit was specifically configured for the needs of an\nintermediate load array. The initial design also incorporated internal\n(redundant) by-pass diodes and a labor-saving corner attachment approach.\n\n2.1 Detailed Design\nThe Photowatt third-generation module detailed design started with\nknown potential photovoltaic failure modes and their respective design\nsolutions. Additionally, there was a desire to integrate productibility\nrequirements into the Block IV design.\n\n- 4 * Trademark of DuPont\n\n`\n\n^\n^\n\nPhotowatt solar cell processing equipment available at the time of\nthe initial design dictated the three inch diameter CZ cells be utilized.\nTherefore, the electrical characteristics and packaging efficiency of\nseveral alternative circuits were evaluated. It was decided that a six\nparallel by twelve series cell circuit allowed the best compromise amongst\npower density, voltage, dimensional and producibility constraints.\nThis circuit configuration, when combined with by-pass diodes, provided\na reasonable power building block for most intermediate-load applications.\nThe cell metal pattern was next assessed. It was desired to minimize\nthree factors, series resistance, shadowing losses and broken cell related\nmodule power losses. A compromise cell metal pattern was selected and\nis shown in Figure 2.1.\nThis pattern, when combined with redundant across-the-cell copper\nribbons, shadowed nine per cent of the cell. It also contributed\nconsiderably to she average curve fill factor of .74 for the qualification\ntest modules. The two main bus collectors were spread further apart than\noptional for series resistance considerations. This, combined with the\nacross-the-cell copper ribbons, lessened the potential power loss should\na ce\'il fracture occur in the field. The maximum loss occurs when the\ncell fractures just outside of a collector bus. This equates to an individual cell loss of 16 per cent. Since there are six paralleled cell strings,\nthe overall module power loss is less than 3 per cent, for a worst case\nsingle fracture. The metal system can accommodate most other simple\nfractures without power loss. This represents a considerable improvement\nover most previous module designs in which a single cell fracture could\nresult in total loss of power.\nSince the cell-to-cell interconnect ribbon is particularly susceptible\nto thermally induced fatigue, continuous strain relieving, in the form\nof rippling, was utilized. Preliminary thermal shock (Lh -RT water) testing of several configurations lead to the selection of a ?ipple amplitude\nof 10 mils and wavelength of 60 mils. A 3 mil thick by 80 mil wide annealed\n(Alloy 110) copper ribbon was utilized.\nSolid copper buses (20 mils by 200 mils) were employed, at each\nend of the twelve series cell strings, to parallel connect the six strings.\nIn the initial design, these buses were directed from each end of the\nmodule, under a string of cells, to a central location, where two redundant\nby-pass diodes and the AMP SOLAR-LOK connect-or housings were installed.\nSubsequent evaluation of the internally positioned by-pass diodes lead\nco their placement outside of the module.\nThe encapsulation system selected for the Photowatt Block IV module\nis a glass superstrate design. The solar cell electrical subassembly is\nembedded in polyvinyl butyral (PVB) which is sandwiched between a sheet\nof low-iron, tempered glass and a backside moisture barrier. The backside\nmoisture barrier is a composite of Tedlar/aluminum foil/Tedlar. This encapsulation system has proved itself in several low-voltage field applications.\nIt does require edge sealing, which is provided by a lead foil tape.\n\n-6-\n\nwow\n\nOMNAL, PAN 19\n\nOf P" QUALM\nlw\n\n31\n01)\n\n19\nlo\n\nAA\nl\n\nC%\n\ncv\n\n\t\n\n`\t\n\n\'\t\n\n1^\t\n\n14\nL\n\n111 11111\n\n1\n\nIIIIIIINMMN\n\n000,011\n\nT\'\n\nCM\n\nt g ^,\n8.\n0\n\n7\n\nIL\n\n\'\n\nThe primary area of concern when this encapsulation system is\nutilized in high voltage applications is a potential electrical path\nbetween the circuit and frame, i.e., the backside aluminum foil. The\ninitial design specified two sheets of 15 mil thick PVB between the circuit\nand backskin. The inner layer of Tedlar (1.5 mils thick) adds to the\nelectrical isolation, as does (3 mil) layer of mylar tape of the perimeter\nof the laminate. Initial testing of this design showed circuit-frame\nbreakdown in the 5000-6000VDC range. At that time, it was decided to\ntreat the perimeter gasket (between the laminate and frame) as a cushioning\nmember only. This allowed the direct use of the extruded gasket material\nwith a single knife cut, to conform around the laminate corners. This\neliminated the cost of a single-piece formed gasket; but created exposed\nareas at the corners. Measurements of two modules after the complete\nsequence of qualification testing showed that one module experienced\nbreakdown at 1250VDC and second module at 1500VDC. The breakdown occurred\nat one corner in each of the two modules. These results initiated a\ndesign/manufacturing evaluation which culminated in the selection of a\none-piece gasket. The one-piece gasket specification requires that the\ncorner construction be free of pin-holes and that the gasket be loaded\nin compression throughout the -40C to +90C temperature range.\nThe frame selected for the Block IV module is an anodized aluminum\nextrusion of an "E" configuration. Its height is 2.0 inches and its base\nis 1.0 inches wide. The initial corner attachment design specified the\nmitering of the extrusions and use of a barbed retension clip. This approach\nminimized the piece part fabrication and frame assembly labor. A single\n(45 0 ) miter cut was needed for each end of the aluminum extrusion and the\n\nmodule could be framed with simple air-actuated cylinder. Environmental\ntesting of this design resulted in gaps occurring at the corners of some\nmodules. Rivets were added at each corner to insure their mechanical\nintegrity. Environmental testing of the riveted corner construction\nshowed that they are an effective solution. Characteristics of the\nPhotowatt Block IV Module are presented in Figure 2.2.\n\n2.2 Preliminary Design Review\nA preliminary design review of the Block IV design was held at the\nJPL. The module electrical, mechanical and physical attributes were\ndiscussed in detail. Photowatt action items from the review were,\n1) provide a clear definition of the cell interconnect strain relief\ndesign, 2) assess the potential galvanic interaction between the frame\n(aluminum) and corner retaining clip (zinc plated steel) and, 3) propose\ncracked cell criteria. These action items were completed and the preproduction modules fabricated.\n\n2.3 Environmental Testin g\nAn initial group of modules were subjected to the Block IV qualification testing sequence. Modules within this group (both the control\nand test modules) exhibited considerable variation in electrical output.\nThis variation of output power was traced to faulty by-pass diodes.\n\n-8-\n\nFigure 2.3 Summary of environmental Qualification Testing\n\nModule\nSerial No.\n\nEnvironmental\nTest\n\nPower Output\n(Watts)\n\nPer Cent Change\nin Power\n\n2W-32\n\nAs-received\n\n38.28\n\n--\n\n2032\n\nTemperature\n\n38.32\n\n+.1\n\n2032\n\nHumidity\n\n38.50\n\n+.5\n\n2032\n\nMechanical\t (+50PSF)\n\n38.60\n\n+.8\n\n2032\n\nTwist\n\n39.25\n\n+2.5\n\n2032\n\nHail\n\n38.64\n\n+.9\n\n2033\n\nAs-received\n\n39.62\n\n--\n\n2033\n\nTemperature\n\n39.14\n\n-1.2\n\n2033\n\nHumidity\n\n39.39\n\n-.6\n\n2033\n\nMechanical\t (+50PSF)\n\n39.67\n\n+.1\n\n2033\n\nTwist\n\n40.14\n\n+1.3\n\n2033\n\nHail\n\n39.71\n\n+.2\n\n2035\n\nAs-received\n\n36.95\n\n--\n\n2035\n\nTemperature\n\n36.18\n\n-2.0\n\n2035\n\nHumidity\n\n36.19\n\n=2.0\n\n2035\n\nMechanical\t (+50PSF)\n\n36.68\n\n+,7\n\n2035\n\nTwist\n\n37.26\n\n+.8\n\n2035\n\nHail\n\n36.93\n\n+.5\n\n2036\n\nAs-received\n\n38.73\n\n--\n\n2036\n\nTemperature\n\n38.97\n\n+,6\n\n20\'1 6\n\nHumidity\n\n38.53\n\n-.5\n\n2036\n\nMechanical\t (\xc2\xb150PSF)\n\n39.31\n\n+1.5\n\n2036\n\nTwist\n\n39.69\n\n+2.5\n\n2036\n\nHail\n\n39.32\n\n+1.5\n\n2037\n\nAs-received\n\n37.12\n\n--\n\n2037\n\nTemperature\n\n36.47\n\n-1.7\n\n2037\n\nHumidity\n\n37.05\n\n-.2\n\n2037\n\nMechanical\t (+50PSF)\n\n38.21\n\n+2.9\n\n2037\n\nTwist\n\n37.85\n\n+1.9\n\n2037\n\nHail\n\n37.15\n\n+,1\n\n_n_\n\nAdditionally, disadherence of the connector terminal housings occurred\non two test nodules; and the corner retaining clips yielded on two test\nmodules, forming gaps at those corners.\nThese modules were reworked in each of the above stated areas and\nsubmitted for evaluation, along with the additional modules as required\nby contract. Five modules from this group were selected for qualification\ntesting. A summary of the qualification test reults is shown in Figure 2.3.\nThe average power output of these modules (as received at JPL) was 38.14\nwatts and 38.35 watts after the complete qualification test sequence.\nDuring mechanical load (+50 PSF) cycling one module developed an intermittant open in one pair\xe2\x80\x94of its redundant output terminals. Two other\nmodules exhibited circuit-to-frame voltage breakdown at 1250 VDC and\n1500 VDC respectively.\nThe edge gasket design modification discussed in Section 2.1 was\ntaken as a corrective action to solve the low circuit-frame isolation\nvoltage exhibited by the two modules during the second qualification\ntest sequence.\n\n2.4 Final Design\nThe final design configuration is presented in Appendix A. This\ndesign differs from the initial version primarily in three areas:\n1) a one-piece formed edge gasket replaces an earlier version with voids at the\nlaminate corners and allowed circuit-to-frame isolation voltage breakdown,\n2) internal by-pass diodes have been eliminated, and 3) rivets have\nreplaced the initially designed corner retaining clips. Additionally,\ntwo pre-production processes were modified. They are the detailed procedures for removing an injection molding release agent from the AMP\nconnector housing and the elimination of solder from the cell edges to\ninsure that individual cells would not short front-to-back.\n\n3.0 Documentation\nPrimary documentation for the Photowatt Block IV Intermediate Load\nModule consists of the Engineering and Manufacturing Documentation package\nand the Inspection System Plan.\nThe Engineering and Manufacturing Documentation package primarily\nconsists of 1) the interface control drawing that also is utilized as\na top assembly drawing, 2) all piece part and material specifications,\nand 3) the manufacturing process flow chart. This documentation has\nbeen prepared and approved by the cognizant technical monitor. A copy\nof the interface control drawing is provided in Appendix A.\nThe Inspection System Plan delineates the specific quality control\n:heck points, criteria, and inspection methodology. It represents a\nworking document that, in several respects, quantifies the traditional\n)ray areas that have existed between the module manufacturer and procurenent personnel.\n\n-10-\n\nIV\n\nFigure 2.2\t\n\nPhotowatt Block IV Model Characteristics\n\nPARAMETER\n\nVALUE\n\nModel Number\n\nML 1961\n\nPower (IOOMW/CM2 .

It is based on three inch diameter solar\ncells, which are more costly per watt to produce than are larger diameter\ncells.\nThe encapsulation system has been proven in many hundreds of low\nvoltage applications. It wiuld be desirable to identify a replacement\nfor the polyvinyl butyral (PVB) pottant which does not require a backside\nmoisture barrier (e.g., aluminum foil). If such a pottant can be identified, then the potentially serious problem of circuit-to-case shorts\ncan be eliminated. It is expected that pottants of this nature will\nevolve over the next several years.\n\n-13-\t\n\nI\n\n6.0 New Technology\nPhotowatt International, Inc. believes that there were no Subject\nInventions made under this contract.\t\n\n{\n1\n\ni\n\nY\n\n-14-\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nInterface Control Drawing\nfor\nPhotowatt International, Inc.\n\nBlock IV\nSolar Cell Module\n\n-15-\n\n\t\n\ni\t\n\no\t\n\na\t\n\n^\t\n\nu\n\n^\n110 1 1\nod\n\nORIGINAL PAGE 18\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n_ .
