b"METAMORPHISM OF THE ODDANCHATRAM ANORTHOSITE, TAMIL\nNADU, SOUTH INDIA. R A Wiebe, Dept. of Geology, Franklin\n. .\nand Marshall College, Lancaster, PA, 17604 and A S.\n.\nJanardhan, Dept. of Geology, Manasa Gangotri, Mysore 6.\nThe Oddanchatram anorthosite [1,2] is located in the\nMadurai District of Tamil Nadu, near the town of Pahi. It\nis emplaced into a granulite facies terrain commonly presumed\nto have undergone its last regional metamorphism in the late\nArchean about 2600 m y\n. . [ 3 ] . The surrounding country rock\nconsists of basic granulites, charnockites and\nmetasedimentary rocks including quartzites, pelites and\ncalc-silicates. The anorthosite is clearly intrusive into\nthe country rock and contains many large inclusions of\npreviously deformed basic granulite and quartzite within 100\nmeters of its contact [ 2 ] . Both this intrusion and the nearby\nKaduvar anorthosite show evidence of having been affected by\nlater metamorphism and deformation.\nThe anorthosite is typical of Proterozoic anorthosites\nin that it is largely massive and coarse-grained, containing\n) and has\non average more than 90 percent plagioclase (An\nassociated lenses rich in Fe-Ti oxides. Plagioc?&g'is\nvariably recrystallized: it generally displays abundant,\nstrongly curved secondary twinning and has strongly sutured\nboundaries. The most common mafic minerals are hornblende,\naugite and orthopyroxene. Hornblende and some pyroxenes\nprobably crystallized during metamor hism, but some pyroxene\nalso occurs in primary igneous textur 6 . Garnet occurs\nlocally as equant crystals in thin discontinuous bands, but\nhas not been found as a reaction rim between plagioclase and\npyroxene. Although delicate primary igneous features are\nlocally well preserved, this anorthosite appears to have been\nstrongly affected by deformation and metamorphism after its\nemplacement. The rocks do not appear to have suffered\nsignificant strain after the growth of garnet.\nIntrusive contacts of the anorthosite with the\nsurrounding country rock a r e w e l l exposed. Sharply bounded\ndikes of relatively fine-grained anorthosite occur at a few\nlocations; some are tightly folded. Anorthosite near the\ncontact commonly contains abundant elongate inclusions Of\nbasic granulite and lesser amounts of garnet-bearing\nquartzite. Post-emplacement deformation is indicated by a\nlocally strong penetrative fabric and by boudinage of some\ninclusions. Assimilation of metasedimentary rocks appears\ncommon along some portions of the contact: where\ncalc-silicate rocks have been incorporated the anorthosite is\nabnormally calcic and where pelitic rocks have been\nincorporated the anorthosite contains discontinuous zones\nwith disseminated quartz and equant garnets 121. Most\ngarnets are partly or completely replaced by delicate\nsymplectites of hypersthene and anorthite.\nMineral assemblages useful for thermobarometry are found\nin the anorthosite and in the surrounding country rock.\n\n\\\n\nMETAMORPHISM OF THE ODDANCHATRAM ANORTHOSITE\nWiebe, R.A.\n\n190\n\n, Janardhan,\n\nA.S.\n\nAnorthositic rocks locally contain garnet, quartz,\northopyroxene and clinopyroxene in addition to the dominant\nintermediate plagioclase. Pelitic country rocks contain an\nearly assemblage of rutile, garnet, sillimanite, and quartz\nwhich has partly reacted to produce prominant rims of\ncordierite between garnet and sillimanite. A charnockite\nlocated roughly t w o km south of Oddanchatram contains the\nassemblage, quartz-plagioclase-orthopyroxene-garnet.\nAlthough some garnets in anorthosite lack symplectite\nrims and occur in sharp contact with primary intermediate\nplagioclase, they more typically have broad, essentially\nunzoned cores and narrow rims depleted in Ca where they are\nin contact with surrounding symplectites of orthopyroxene and\nanorthite. Garnet in the pelitic rocks is much lower in\ngrossularite component and essentially unzoned. In the\ncharnockite it is also unzoned and very low in MgO.\nOrthopyroxenes in anorthositic rocks have Mg/(Fe+Mg) of\nroughly 0.55. Neither pyroxene is significantly zoned.\nOrthopyroxene in the charnockite has much lower Mg/(Mg+Fe).\nPrimary plagioclase in the anorthosite ranges from about An46\nto An55. Plagioclase in the symplectites is between An95 and\n-5.\n\nIn the charnockite it is An34.\n\nMetamorphic equilibration temperatures in the\nanorthosites, based on coexisting garnet and cliBopyroxene,\nrange from a maximum of about 92OoC to about 700 C It has\n.\nnot been possible to determine a maximum temperature of\nmetamorphism in the country rocks. The assemblage,\ngarnet-cordierite, is widespread in the pelitic rocks but is\nretrogressive. These minerals are essegtially unzoned and\nyield temperatures between 780 and 700 C\ntemperatures that\nclosely match the minimum temperatures recorded by\nsymplectites in the anorthosite. The relict assemblage,\ngarnet-sillimanite-quartz-rutile, could have been stable at\nmuch higher temperatures.\nEstimates of pressures within the anorthositic rocks are\nbased on the association of garnet-plagioclase-quartz with\northopyroxene or clinopyroxene. Garnets that lack\nsymplectite rims and the cores ofoother garnets yield\nestimates of about 11.3 kb at 920 C\n. Garnet rims in\nequilibrium with surrounding anorthite-hypersthene\nsymplectites yield estimates of from 7.3 to 5.6 kb at 775OC.\nPressures estimated for the pelitic rock are based on the\nretrogressive assemblage, garnet-cordierite. The model of\nAranovich and Podlesskii [ 4 ] yields pressures of from 7 7 to\n.\n7.2 kb. These pressures are consistent with the minimum\nvalues recorded by symplectite assemblages in the\nanorthosite. The relict assemblage,\ngarnet-sillimanite-quartz- rutile, could have been stable at\nthe highest pressures and temperatures determined for the\nanorthosite. In the charnockite, the assemblage,\nquartz-plagioclase-orthopyroxene- garnetd yields an estimate\nof 8 8 kb, assuming a temperature of 900 C\n.\n.\nBecause the Oddanchatram anorthosite should be similar\n\n-\n\nMETAMORPHISM OF THE ODDANCHATRAM ANORTHOSITE\nWiebe, R.A.,\n\nJanardhan, A.S.\n\nin age (ca. 1400 my) to the Chilka Lake anorthosite [5] the\nmetamorphism of the Oddanchatram anorthosite should record\ncrustal conditions in this part of the south Indian shield\nduring the middle to late Proterozoic. Temperatures and\npressures reported for other rocks in this portion of the\nshield (e.g. rocks near Madurai and Kodaikanal [6]) may\ntherefore be a record of Proterozoic rather than late Archean\nmetamorphism.\nThe maximum pressures reported here require that Archean\nsupracrustal rocks in the southeastern portion of the south\nIndian shield were buried to depths of 35 km in the middle\nProterozoic. Because the present crustal thickness is still\nabout 40 km (71 and because there is no evidence for\npost-anorthosite underplating, the crustal thickness in this\npart of the shield during the middle Proterozoic should have\nbeen roughly 75 km. The production of such abnormally thick\ncrust could be explained by continental collision and\nunderthrusting of the eastern margin of the south Indian\nshield beneath a converging continent. The Eastern Ghat\norogenic belt, which lies roughly 100 km east of the\nOddanchatram anorthosite, is thought to be such a\nmid-Proterozoic collisional belt [8]. Metamorphic mineral\nages of 1000 my [9] in this belt suggest that the Eastern\nGhat orogenic event could have been responsible for the\nmetamorphism and deformation of the Oddanchatram anorthosite.\nAcknowledgement: We are extremely grateful to Dr. S\n.\nSaravanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Tamil Nadu\nMinerals, Ltd., Madras, for all of his help in field\nlogistics.\nReferences\n[l] Narasimha Rao, P (1964) Jndian Min, 5 , 99-104.\n.\n[2] Janardhan, A S. & Wiebe, R A (1985) JLGeol.
