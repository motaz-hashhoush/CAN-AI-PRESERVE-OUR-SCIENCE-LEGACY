The Station complex, in its initial operating capability configuration, includes a continuously habitable manned element, a polar orbiting unmanned platform, and a second unmanned platform co-orbiting with the manned element. All elements are dependent on the Space Transportation System (STS) for initial placement on-orbit and for subsequent logistical services. The manned element will be designed for long duration operations with systems maintainable on-orbit and operationally autonomous from ground control. A major feature of the Station will be its adaptability to evolutionary technology upgrades; and the Space Station, as a system, is to be designed for maximum ease of use by its users.", "title": "Space station", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T18:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860021130, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Thompson, D.
