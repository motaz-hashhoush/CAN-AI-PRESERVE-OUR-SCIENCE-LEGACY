Testing by the manufacturer usually involves performance testing per the datasheet requirements. However, the customer may have applications that require performance under unique operational and environmental conditions. In general, electrical tests for connectors include dielectric withstanding voltage, low-signal-level contact resistance, insulation resistance, contact resistance, and standing wave ratio. Environmental tests include humidity, temperature, and contaminating conditions, as well as mechanical stress environments including vibration, mechanical shock, and durability cycling exposures.\t\n", "isLessonsLearned": true, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "", "submissionId": 20205007983, "name": "", "location": "", "id": "3e6c5fcf602c4f3386d7c080c586b12b"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20205007983, "isbn": "978-1-119-67976-9", "publisher": "Wiley-IEEE", "id": "1079fe0b03c24855a087a2f8a6277a4a", "publicationName": "Electrical Connectors: Design, Manufacture, Test, and Selection", "publicationDate": "2020-10-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "issuePublicationDate": "2020-12-01T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20205007983 c10.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20205007983/downloads/20205007983%20c10.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20205007983/downloads/20205007983%20c10.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20205007983/downloads/20205007983%20c10.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
