b"MARKET TRENDS\nRichard D. FitzSimnons\nMcDonnell Douglas Corporation\n\nSUMMARY\nThe public,\nby its reception\nand patronage\nof the widening\nConcorde supersonic\nservice,\nwill\ndictate\nwhether a need exists\nfor a second-generation\nsupersonic\ntransport.\nAs of this writing,\nthis need has not been demonstrated\nunequivocally; however, preliminary\nresults\nare favorable\n. . . the public\nis willing\nto\npatronize\nsupersonic\nservice,\neven at premium fares,\nwith-marginal\nschedule\nfrequency,\nand in less than spacious\naccomnodations.\na second generation\nsupersonic\ntransport\nmust meet society's\nWithout question,\nneeds, and at the same time be profitable\nfor the operators\nand manufacturers,\nStudies\nindicate\nthat a design\nor such a program should not be initiated,\nmeeting the requirements\ncan be described;\nhowever, unlike\nmajor civil\naircraft\ndevelopments\nof the past, an advanced supersonic\ntransport\ncannot be conceived\nthat would be economically\ncompetitive\nfor all airline\nlong haul passenger\nmarkets.\nThe supersonic\nairplane\ndirect\nop=ting\ncosts (DOC) seem inherently\nboth as envisioned\ntoday and for the foreseeable\nhigher than subsonic\ndesigns,\nfuture.\nAccordingly,\nno case can be made for an AST to compete for the excursion\ntraveler,\nwho is economy minded and sees no economic value to increased\nspeed.\nA very large segment of the over water,\nlong haul passenger market,\n31% of the\npassengers who provide\n42% of the passenger revenue,\noffers\na significant\nThis is for both the first\nclass\nmarket for an advanced supersonic\ntransport.\nThe supersonic\ntransport\nmay be more\nand full-fare\neconomy passenger markets.\ncompetitive\nhere in spite of lower costs of subsonic\ntransports,\nas passenger\npreference\nis a more powerful\nvariable\nthan DOC. This latter\nfact was amply\ndemonstrated\nin the late fifties\nwhen the jets\ncompletely\nreplaced\nthe\nreciprocating\nengine transports\non most world routes,\nin spite of slightly\nhigher

airlines\nin 1975 realized\nabout the same revenue\nfrom first\nclass than from their\nmore heavily\npublicized\ncharter\nbusiness.\nAnd\nto realize\nthis they handled only l/4 as many passengers.\nANALYSIS\nInitially,\nin the market analysis\nconducted\nin 1973 (fig.\n6) in the NASA contract\neffort,\nMcDonnell Douglas examined more than 500 city-pairs\nthroughout\nthe world\nfor supersonic\nservice\nfor the period\n1985-1994 considering\n12 world market\ngroups such as North Atlantic,\nEurope-Mid-East,\nand North and Central\nPacific.\nThe initial\ncity-pairs\nmet the following\nqualifications:\noverwater\nroutes\n(some tag-end city-pairs\nwere included\nfor joining\ntraffic),\nminimum city-pair\ndistance\nof 1667 km (900 miles)\nand all city-pairs\ncapable of generating\nsuffithe period\n1985-2,909 to suppo,rt scheduled supercient\npassenger traffic\nduring\nsonic service.\nAn iterative\nprocess of computer-aided\nmarket analysis\nwas\nundertaken\nfor these combined world market groups in which market growth rates\nwere projected\nfrom the base year 1975 to the year 2009.\nThe supersonic\nrevenue\npassenger-kilometers\n(passenger-miles)\nare estimated\nto grow from 87 billion\n(47 billion)\nin 1980 to 261 billion\n(141 billion)\nby the year 2000.\nThis is a\n5.7 percent\naverage annual growth rate over the forecast\nperiod.\n986\n\nThe

comparison\nis shown of the payload range capabilities\nof the various\nimportant\nsupersonic\ntransport\nprograms as compared to typical\ncity-pair\ndistances\n(fig.\n7).\nThe Concorde and the former U.S. SST both show limited\nrange as compared to what\ncan be predicted\nfor an advanced supersonic\ntransport\nas a result\nof the\ncooperative\nNASA-Industry\nSCAR efforts\nof the past four years.\nThe payload range shows a 851 Skilometer\n(46!lO-nautical-mile)ca?ability\nfor a\nnear term airplane,\nfor a go-ahead in 1983 w!lic!l would use a low risk enqine\ncycle.\nAlso\nshown is what

satisfy\nfuture\nrange requirements\nfor a supersonic\ntransport.\nOpening up the Pacific\ncan become a reality\nand supersonic\ntravel\nthere can be\nespecially\nappealing.\nAlso shown is a 225-passenger\ndesign somewhat smaller\nthan the DC-lo-30 size used for the tlcDonnel1 Douglas baseline\nsupersonic\ntransport\nat 273 passengers.\nThis seems to be a better\nsize to match tile\npassenger demand as a result\nof recently\ncompleted market trend studies.\nThis\nsubject\nof passenger size is discussed\nlater\nin this paper.\nDirect\noperating\ncosts (fig.\n8) in 1976

even less attractive\nfor purely\neconomy minded passengers._\nIn analyzing\nthe 1974 North Atlantic\nyield\nper passenger\nnautical\nmile (fig.\n11),\nit is readily\napparent\nthat the first\nclass yield\nof over 3.1 cents/seat\nkilometer (15 cents/seat\nmile)\nfar exceeds the yield\nof the other segments of the\nmarket.\nIt is 75% higher than full-fare\neconomy class and over 2-l/2\ntimes as\nhigh as the 22-45 day excursion\nyield.\nIt is also significant\nthat the yield\nof\nfull-fare\neconomy class is 50% higher than for the 22-45 day excursion.\nthe total\noperating\ncosts shown earlier\n(fig.\n9)\nTo put yield\nin perspective,\nwere 1.9 cents/seat\nkilometer\n(3.5 cents/seat\nmile)\nfor the DC-lC)-30 and 2.4\ncents/seat\nkilometer\n(4.4 cents/seat\nmile)\nfor the MDC-AST in 1976 dollars.\nAlso, the Concorde was shown at about 4.3 cents/seat\nkilometer\n(8 cents/seat\nThese total\noperating\ncosts are well under\nmile)\nor about twice the DC-lo-3q.\nthe yield\nof

yield\npassenger market.\nThe North Atlantic\nmarket share that seems to be important\nfor a supersonic\nairplane\n(fig.\n12) can be roughly\nestimated\nto be 19% of the passengers\nwho\nprovide\n27% of the revenue. ' The remaining\n81% of the passengers\nwould continue\nto be served by subsonic\ntransports.\nNot all of the full-fare\neconomy passengers\ncan be expected\nto patronize\nsupersonic\nservice\ndue to
