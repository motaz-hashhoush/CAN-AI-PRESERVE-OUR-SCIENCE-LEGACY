These six teachers were among 91 IISME Teacher Fellows working at various corporate, government agency, and university sites throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. These NASA-Ames fellowship positions are described in brief. One requirement of the IISME Summer Fellowship program is that teachers develop a personal Action Plan for classroom transfer. These Action Plans are published in abstract form in an annual catalog.
