The ball nut is adapted to receive an input torque and in response rotates and supplies a drive force. The ball screw extends through the ball nut and has a first end and a second end. The ball screw receives the drive force from the ball nut and in response selectively translates between a retract position and a extend position. The ball screw stop is mounted on the ball screw proximate the first end to translate therewith. The ball screw stop engages the ball nut when the ball screw is in the extend position, translates, with compliance, a predetermined distance toward the first end upon engaging the ball nut, and prevents further rotation of the ball screw upon translating the predetermined distance.", "title": "Ball Screw Actuator Including a Compliant Ball Screw Stop", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2017-04-03T09:32:08.4600000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20170002889, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wingett, Paul T."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "26a40859de374de48b8205d576001e19"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20170002889, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hanlon, Casey"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "95def7b97ffa4a2dad470f0b61a92058"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20170002889, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170002889, "id": "0452e11fdc554bf3852fe344128f44de", "publicationDate": "2017-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170002889.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170002889/downloads/20170002889.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170002889/downloads/20170002889.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170002889/downloads/20170002889.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
