In order to\nprovide a minimum weight and volume EVA system, it is necessary to use a high\npressure oxygen storage system. Because these systems are designed for multiple\nuse during a flight, a method must be obtained to recharge these high pressure\noxygen tanks from the spacecraft oxygen supply. Normally i oxygen is stored in\nthe spacecraft in supercritical oxygen tanks, having an operating pressure of\nThe oxygen boost pump described in this report is\n+06 6.205 Pa (900 psia).\t\na simple,reliable device, which can be used to charge the high pressure oxygen\ntank in the EVA equipment from spacecraft supply. The Lnly interface with the\nspacecraft is the +06 6.205 Pa supply line.\nThis report presents results of study program activities for the oxygen\nboost pump, conducted by AiResearch for the Ames Research Center, Moffett\nField, California, under Contract NAS 2-8794.\nThis report summarizes the breadboard study results and oxygen tank survey,\n(documented in the mid-term Report, AiResearch Report No. 75-11603) and presents the results of the flight-type prototype design and analysis.\n\n+\t\n\nw^\t\n\nAIRESEARCN MANUFACTURING COMPANY \t\nOF CALIFORNIA\n\n75-12264\nPage 1-1\n\n2.1 BACKGROUND\nA breadboard compressor, built and tested under a prior study program\ndescribed in AiResearch Engineering Report 74-41052A, dated April 15, 1975,\ndemonstrated the free piston expansion concept, generated performance data as\na baseline for evaluation and comparison of follow-on designs, and indicated\nareas where improvement was required. This study program was performed for\nNASA Crew Systems Division, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.\nThe midterm report 75-11603, dated June 26, 1975, documented the study\neffort to that date. This included 1) additional analysis, 2) an update of\nthe computer program with improved modeling to reflct actual performance of\nthe compressor and to predict performance of the flight-type prototype, and\n3) design innovations for the flight-type prototype to improve energy management. These design innovations include a redesign of the automatic cycle valve,\ncapacitor, capacitor scheduler,and control orifices. The study to this point\nalso recommended that final compressor output should be limited to +07 2.758 Pa\n(4000 psia) maximum.\nIn addition, a preliminary evaluation of compression thermal effects indicate that sufficient heat dissipation will be inherent to the compressor design\nso that the compressed gas temperature will not exceed +02 3.442 t KK (1600F),\nwhen operating in cabin ambient temperatures up to +02 2.998 t (80\xc2\xb0F).\nThis final report proposes continuance of this program,resulting in the\ndetail design, fabrication, and testing of a flight-type prototype..\n2.2 ASSUMPTIONS - DESIGN CRITERION\nAn inflow control valve will be used to control pumping frequency,and an\nadjustable tank pressure sensing electrical switch will be used to control tank\npressure.\nThe following performance parameters were utilized in the modeling analysis\nand design of the flight weight prototype:\nCompressor discharge pressure\ndesign point:\n\n+07 2.758 Pa (4000 psia)\n\nCompressor discharge pressure\nrange:\n\nj-06 6.205 Pa to +07 2.758 Pa\n(900 to 4000 psia)\n\nSupply pressure design point:\n\n+06 6.205 Pa (900 psia)\n\nSupply pressure range:\n\n+05 6.895 to +07 1.379 Pa\n(100 to 2000 psia)\n\nCabin flow design point:\n\n+01 7.560 kg/s (1.25 lbm/ h)\n\nNOTE: Cabin flow (motor vent flow plus leakage) is equal to the total\nflow to the compressor minus compressor discharge flow.\n\nH5V\n\nAIRESEARCN MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nOF CALIFORNIA\n\n75-12264\nPage 2-1\n\ni\t\n\nr\n\ni\n\n2.3 OPERATION OF PROPOSED FLIGHT-TYPE PUMP\nThe proposed flight-type prototype pump, shown on Figure 2-I, operates\nin the following manner:\nThe spacecraft oxygen supply +06 6.204 Pa (900 psia) enters the pump at\nthe oxygen inlet port. Oxygen will flow through the compressor inlet and outlet check valves and into the oxygen tank, without any pumping action, until\nthe oxygen tank is precharged to the supply pressure. This inlet supply oxygen\nis also being directed through the inflow control valve into the gas capacitor.\nWhen the force developed by increasing capacitor pressure, acting over the\ntrigger area on the motor piston, approaches supply pressure acting on the\ncompressor piston area, the trigger valve starts to leak, exposing motor piston area to capacitor pressure, causing the motor piston to move. Initial\nmovement fully uncovers the trigger port, which exposes the full motor piston\narea to capacitor pressure, which rapidly accelerates the motor piston, providing the pumping energy. As this assembly (motor and compressor pistons) moves\ntoward the compressor end of the pump, the compressor inlet check valve closes,\ntrapping the gas in the compressor chamber. This gas is then compressed and\nflows out to charge the oxygen tank. At the end of the compression stroke, the\nmotor gas is vented to cabin through vent holes in the side of the unit. The\nsupply pressure of +06 6.204 Pa (900 psia), entering the compression chamber\nthrough the inlet check valve,provides the motive force for the return, or\nsuction stroke.\nThe bellows assembly, located above the capacitor, schedules the position\nof the capacitor piston to increase the capacitor volume as tank pressure\nincreases. This varies the quantity of motor gas as a function of oxygen tank\npressure, which matches the motor energy to the required compressor energy, so\nthat motor gas is not wasted at lower tank pressures.\nThe flight-type prototype pump differs from prior version in the following\naspects:\na.\n\nThe motor ca p acitor and tria4erin q valve have been im p roved. A\ndifferential area bellows and spring assembly senses increasing tank\npressure to increase capacitor volume. This increases motor energy\nper cycle to match pumping energy requirements. The triggering\nmechanism is separate from the energy scheduling mechanism. The\ntriggering device initiates the cycle when proper energy charge has\naccumulated in the capacitor, and discharges to the motor through\nan enlarged flow area to minimize flow losses. Unlike the prior\nautomatic cycling valve, the new capacitor and triggering mechanism\npermits operation over a wide range of supply pressures.\n\nb.\n\nA vernier adjustable inflow control valve has been added. The valve\nallows adjustment of capacitor charge rate and, therefore, pumping\nspeed and cabin flow rate. Capacitor charging time ctn be reduced\nand pumping frequency and vent flow to cabin can be increased.\n\nAIRESEARCH MANUFACTURING COMPANY \t\nOf CALIFORNIA\n\n75-12264\nPage 2-2\n\n0\n\nX\n\n-\t\n\ni\n\nK\t\n\nI\t\nN\n\nO\t\n\nH\n\nz\nw\t\n\t\n\no\n\nO\t\n^\t\n\nI\t\n\nN\t\n\na\t\n\n(y\n\nI\t\n/\n\ns\n\nr\t\n\nj\t\n\n::\t\n\n(\t\n\nj ,^\n\n(\t\n\nI\t\n\n^\t\n\nI I\ti\t\n\nLa.\t\nj\n\nVIA\n\nIn\nM\n\n\\\n\n__\t\n\n--\t\n\nz\nw\n\n}\n\nX\nO\t\n\ng\nN\nLLS\n0:\naW\nJ\n\nc D\n\nUO\n\nOW\n\nY\nV\n\n0 =\nN U\nN\n\naJ^\n\nLLI\npC W W\n\nz\ndO\nH\n\nF-\n\nEa\n\nO\n\no\n\nzo\xc2\xa2\n\n3 0\nOcGW\nJF-_j\n\nJ\n\nF- N\nW W U\nJ GC F W\n1^z awe\n_J\t\noza\nU \t\n\n0^I0m ilL\n\nI\t\n\nI\n\nI ^.^ I ^^ (I\t\n\nI iI \t\nI\t\n\nIill\t\n\nN\t\n\nCL\n\nw\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\t\n\nz Q 1\t\n\nCL.7\n\nN\n\nU\n\n= Q `A\nU\nW\nz\n\nL7\t\n\nJ\nG\nW\nZ\nU\nN\nN\nd\nL7\n\nOnsvv AIRESEARCN MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nOF CALIFORNIA\n\nM\nN\n\nN\n\nrn\nv\n\na\nE\nD\n\nCL\n\nT\n\nv\na\n\nO\nL-\n\nv\n\n0a\nT\nt\nL\n\nv\nm\n\n0\n\nLA\n\n0\n\nL\n\na\n\nN\nv\nL\n7\nO\'1\nLi\n\n75-12264\n\nPage 2-3\n\n_\nI\n\nC.\t\n\na\n\nI^\n\nr\nj\n\nA pressure indicating electrical switch has been added. The switch\nIs actuated by an adjustable screw actuator mounted to the tank\npressure sensing bellows assembly. The switch can be used to shut\noff supply pressure to stop pumping at a preselected pressure. A\nsnap-acting, pneumatically-actuated valve would be used instead of\nthe electrical switch in an actual flight application to avoid an\nelectrical interface with the spacecraft.\n\nd. The variable volume ca p acitor piston has increased area and has been\nconformed to minimum residual volume when cycled. The increased area\nreduces the stroke required from the bellows volume scheduling device\nover the range of operation. The reduced residual or dead capacitor\nvolume provides a small but significant increase in available pumping\nenergy per unit of charge.\n2.4 SPECIAL FEATURES\nThe design selected for the flight weight prototype incorporates many\nspecial features, which are described below.\na.\n\nl\t\n\nPumping over a range of supply pressure. The pumping process is\ndependent on triggering and stroking. The triggering process is\nindependent of supply pressure since the force balance between the\ntrigger and compressor piston at the start of stroke is a function\nof their respective areas, which do not change. The trigger area is\nslightly greater than the compressor piston effective area, and they\nare both fed by a common source of supply pressure. Triggering\noccurs when capacitor pressure reaches a value somewhat below compressor cylinder pressure, independent of level.\nThe stroking process varies considerably with variations in supply\npressure. As supply pressure goes down, pumping energy requirements\nincrease (increased compression ratios) and stored capacitor energy\ndecreases. Trigger cycling continues, but the pumping energy unbalance causes short stroking. At increased supply pressures, excessive\nenergy is stored in the capacitor, resulting in high motor gas usage\nand impact of the motor piston at the end of the stroke.\nThe pump will continue to operate over relatively large variations\nin supply pressure, but gas consumption efficiency will degrade and\nservice life may suffer.\n\nb.\n4\t\n\nConservation of motor gas-pumping efficiency. Expansion of motor gas\nranges from 15:1 to 5:1 at peak pump output. Although useful pumping\nenergy is not extractable over the entire stroke, this expansion\nreduces the motor gas requirements and greatly improves pumping\nefficiency.\n\nAIRESEARCH M ANUFACIURING COMPANY\t\nOf CALIFORNIA\n\n7S- 12264\nPage 2-4\n\n!i\n\nC.\t\n\nAutomatic adjustment of motor energy. Discharge pressure feedback\nto the capacitor scheduling device adjusts the capacitor volume to\nmatch pumping requirements. This prevents excessive energy overstroking at low uutput pressures, short stroking at high output\npressures, and maintains peak pumping efficiency over the entire\npumping range.\n\nd.\t\n\nPreselection of tank pressure and automatic cutout. Discharge pressure feedback to the capacitor scheduling device bellows assembly)\nprovides a linear mechanical stroke proportional to tank pressure.\nA screw adjustment on this mechanical output is used to actuate an\nelectrical switch for setting a predetermined pressure level. The\nelectrical signal, when switched, can be used directly or through a\nlatching relay to interrupt supply pressure,which will stop the pump.\n\nC.\t\n\nAutomatic initial charge of pressure vessel to supply pressure. The\ncompressor inlet and outlet check valves allow the vessel being charged\nto be filled to supply pressure automatically. Compared to other\npositive displacement devices that do not allow flowthrough, considerable pumping gas is conserved at the design point supply pressure\nof +06 6.205 Pa (900 psia). Devices without flowthrough would require\nadditional bypass components to achieve the same results.\n\nf.\n\nA maximum pump discharge pressure of +07 2.758 Pa (4000 psia). This\npressure was selected based on overall system considerations, which\nIncluded tank-gas compressibility relationships, other component\nIn the pump\ncomplexities, and pump design and reliability impacts.\t\n1) maximum capacitor\ndesign, this is reflected in several areas: \t\n^:.lume--reset mechanism stroke at +07 2.758 Pa tank pressure;\n2) compressor seal design; 3) compressor cylinder, inlet and outlet\ncheck valve design; and 4) cutout switch design.\n\ng.\n\nPumping at very low rates to match cabin flow reguirerients_ with\nInflow to the capacitor\noptional selectable increased flow rate. \t\ndetermines charge time per cycle and therefore cycle rate or frequency.\nThe vernier adjustable capacitor metering valve allows capacitor\ncharge times approaching two seconds to be selected. With this inflow, the pump can be slowed to less than 0.5 cycle per second.\n\nIf the cabin usage rate is +01 7.560 kg/sec (1.25 lbm/hr), and the motor\ngas usage is set to match it, the time to charge an oxygen tank and the amount\nof oxygen vented into the cabin is shown in Table 2-1 below:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 AIRESEARCM MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nq\nq -\t\n\nCI CALIFORNIA\n\n75-12264\nPage 2-5\n\n\t\n\nr\n\n4\n\nTABLE 2-1\n\'\t\n\nTANK CHARGE TIME AND QUANTITY OF OXYGEN VENTED TO CABIN\nVS FINAL TANK PRESSURE\n\nFinal Oxygen\t\nTank Pressure\t\n\nTime to Charge\t\nOxygen Tank, min\t\n\n+07 1.379 Pa (2000 psia) \t\n\n17\t\n\n-01 1.633 kg (0.36 lbm)\n\n+07 2.069 Pa (3000 psia) \t\n\n26\t\n\n-01 2.495 kg (0.55 lbm)\n\n+07 2.758 Pa (4000 psia)\t\n\n34\t\n\n-01 3.221 kg (0.71 lbm)\n\nAAnIrll AIR[SEARCN MANUFACTURING COMPANY\n\'^\t\n01 CALIFORNIA\t\t\n\nQuantity of Oxygen\nVented Into Cabin\n\n75-12264\nPage 2-6\n\n1\n\n3.\t\n\nOXYGEN TANK SURVEY\n\n3.1 INTRODUCTION\nAiResearch has conducted a survey of high pressure tank manufacturers to\ndetermine the availability of off-the-shelf tanks. The survey was limited to\ncryoformed stainless steel, filament-wound, and Inconel 718 tanks. Cryoformed\ntanks are fabricated by ARDE, Inc., Mahwah, N.J; filament-wound tanks are\nfabricated by Brunswick, Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, and Structural Composities\nIndustries, Azusa, California; and Inconel 718 tanks are fabricated by\nAiResearch.\n3.2 DISCUSSION\n3.2.1 Design Criteria\nTentative tank design criteria were established as follows:\nPressure range: +07 1.379 Pa to +07 4.826 Pa (2000 to 7000 psig)\nUsable gas:\t\n\n-01 7.258 Kg down to +06 1.034 Pa (1.6ibm down to\n150 psia)\n\nService:\t\n\nOxygen gas\n\nTemp. limits:\t\n\n+02 2.193 t K to +02 3.443 t K (-65 to +1600F)\n\nPress. cycles:\t\n\n10,000 minimum\n\nProof press:\t\n\n1.5 x operating\n\nBurst press:\t\n\n2.0 x operating\n\nCalculations were made to determine tank volume required to hold -01 7.258 kg\n(1.6 ibm) of usable oxygen at various tank pressures. For theses calculations,\nit was considered that the tank usable oxygen supply was depleted when tank\npressure was less than +06 1.034 Pa (150 psis)\'. Results have been plotted in\nFigure 3-1. Volumes given are independent of tank shape.\nAnalysis of Figure 3-1 indicates that the olume decrease from +07 2.758\nPa to +07 4.826 Pa (4000 to 7000 psia) is only +P4 6.880 M 5 (42 in. 3 ), which is\nvery small when c3^mnpared with a typical life supZort system volume of -02\n6.556 m 3 (4000 in.). The most significant volum changes occur in the +06 6.895\nto +07 2.068 Pa (1000 to 3000 psia) range. At ,-;6 6.205 Pa (900 psia), which\nis the spacecraft supeScritical cryogjnic oxygen tupply pressure, oxygen density is +01 8.42 kg/m (3.0426 x 10" lbm/in. ). At this pressure, a -02\n1.028 m 3 (627 in.} tank would provide the desired -01 7.258 kg 1.6 lbm) of\nusable oxygen. Since the boost pump would not be needed at pressures Below\n+06 6.205 Pa (900 psia), tank volumes larger than -02 1.028 m 3 O27 in. ) were\nnot seriously considered for the tank survey.\n\n7A AIRESEARCM MANUFACTURINJ COMPANY \t\nOf CALIFORNIA\n\n75-12264\nPage 3- 1\n\n700\nNOTES:\n1.\t\n\nCONVERSION OF PRESS-. 12 E\t (PSIA)\t TO SI\t UNITS.\nMULTIPLY PSIA BY \t +03 6 . 895 Pa\nEXAMPLE:\t\n1000 PSIA x +03 6.895 = +06 6.895 Pa\n\n2.\t\n\nCONVERSION OF VOLUME\t (IN. 3) TO SI\t UNITS\nMULTIPLY\t IN. 3 BY -05 1.639\nEXAMPLE:\t\n100 IN. 3 x -05 1.639 = -03 1.639\n\n600\n\n500\ni\n3.\t\nz\n\nFOR 1.6 LBM 0 2 GAS AT 53CPR\n(GAS REMAINING IN TANK AT PRESSURES BELOW\n1.0 PSIA\t\n\n400\n\nM\'\n\nIS ASSUMED TO BE NON-USABLE)\n\nW\nJ\nO\n\nZ\t\n\n300\n\nH\n1\n\ni\n\n200\n\nI\ni\n\n100\n\n0\n0\n\n1000\t\n\n2000\t\n\n3000\t\n\n4000\t\n\n5000\t\n\n6000\t\n\n7000\n\nFigure 3-1.

This includes the oxygen fill disconnect, pressure transducer, tubing, and regulator. Each item is evaluated in the following\nparagraphs.\n3.2.3.1 Oxygen Fill Disconnect\nDisconnects are normally available up to +07 2.068 Pa (3000 psia) maximum\noperating pressure. For pressures above +07 2.068 Pa(3000 psia), less are\navailable. There is generally little weight difference between those designed\nfor the lower and higher pressures. Costs for the higher pressure units may\nbe slightly higher and leakage problems are more severe, resulting in lower\nreliability.\n3.2.3.2 Pressure Transducer\nTransducers in the pressure range up to +07 1.724 Pa (2500 psia) are\nreadily available. Above this pressure, they are less available. A transducer\ndesigned for +07 3.447 Pa (5000 psia) may weigh 5 to 10 percent more than the\n+07 1.724 Pa (2500 psia) unit and may be 20 to 50 percent more costly.\n\now w\t\n\nAIRESEARCH MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nOF CALIFORNIA\t\n\n75-12264\nPage 3-5\n\n\t\n\nf\ni\n\n3.2.3.3 Tubin\n4\n\n\t\nThe pressure capability of tubing varies with wall thickness, outside\ndiameter, and material.

Their total weight was\n-01 3.375 kg (0.774 lbm). This represents approximately 8 percent of the\noxygen tank weight.

There is little difference in material\ncost between the first three listed wall thicknesses. The last one, -03 1.981\nm (0.078 in.), is rated as superpressure tubing and can cost considerably more.\nAlso to be considered are costs associated with preparation of tube ends, bend\nradii, types of end fittings, etc. The -03 1.981 m (0.078 in.) wall tubing,\nfor example, requires special fittings, which add additional weight and cost.\n3.2.3.4 Regulators\nPressure regulators in the range up to +07 2.068 Pa (3000 fsia) are also\nreadily available. For units above +07 2.068 Pa (3000 psia), urits are less\navailable and may be considered a special design.

This minimizes potential\nleakage through the fill disconnect and high pressure regulator. A typical\nfill and shutoff valve used in the illustrated system can weigh up to -01 9.072\nkg (21bm ). The same valve, if designed for +07 2.068 Pa (3000 psia) or less,\nwould weigh approximately 25 to 35 percent of the high pressure valve weight.\nFabrication costs for the high pressure valve are extremely high, seat\nmaterials and finishes are very critical, seat coinage (caused by repeated\nvalve operation) is common, and test costs are usually high. All these considerations are minimized at pressures of +07 2.068 Pa (3000 psia) and below.\n3.2.3.6 Additional Benefits\nAdditional benefits that can be expected at lower pressures include:\n1) lower design costs, 2) increased safety, 3) greater reliability, 4) improved\nmaintainability, 5) longer life, and 6) lower spares costs.\n\nZ.\n\nAIRESEARCN MANUFACTURING COMPANY\t\nOF CALIFORNIA\t\n\n75-12264\nPage 3-7\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n4.\t\n\nOXYGEN BOOST PUMP DESIGN AND ANALYSIS\n\n4.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe breadboard boost pump, built and tested under a study program and\ndescribed in AiResearch Report 74-410521, Rev. A, demonstrated the need for\nbetter energy management. Improvements in this area were achieved through\nImproved computer modeling and new mechanical designs. Design innovations\ninclude a redesign of the automatic cycle valve with the attendant capacitor,\npressure feedback, and control orifices. Adoption of the innovations results\nin better performance and reduced size, weight, and volume of the boost pump.\nin addition, an evaluation of compression thermal effects indicated that\nsufficient heat dissipation will be inherent to the boost pump design so that\nthe compressed gas temperature will not exceed +02 3.441 t, (160 0 F) when operating in cabin ambient temperatures up to +02 2.998 t k (860F).\nInitial boost pump analysis indicates that the final tank pressure should\nbe limited to +07 2.758 Pa (4000 psia) maximum to avoid seal and energy management development problems.\n4.2 DISCUSSION\n4.2.1 Alternatives Considered\n4.2.1.1\t\n\nInitial Prototype Design\n\nThe initial prototype design, shown in Figure 4-I, resulted from the objective of improving the energy effectiveness of a constant motor pressure, free\npiston compressor or boost pump. Basically, in a commercial boost pump, constant pressure is applied to a large area motor piston, which strokes a small\narea compressor piston to produce a smaller volume of higher pressure gas. At\nthe end of the compression cycle, the motor piston swept volume (at the same\npressure as supplied) is exhausted to ambient without doing any further work.\nThe objective was to conceive a mechanism that would utilize a greater\npercentage of the specific energy of the input gas to do work before venting,\nand thereby use less input gas.\n\naw wEr* AIRESEARCN MANUFACTURING COMPANY \t\n.92,\n\t\nOF CALIFORNIA\t\n\n75-12264\nPage 4- 1\n\ni\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALPI\'Y\n\ns\t\n\ng ii\t\n\na\t\n\ns\n\no\n\nww^^ AIRESEARCH MANUFACTURING COMPANY\nOF CALIFORNIA\n\nFes.\n\n--\n\ni\nu^\na\n5\n\n^\n\n^^ g\nIt\n\nv\nO\n\nCL v\n\nE a\n7 y,\na ^\nO\n0 0-\n\nL-\n\nN O\n\nC m\n\nm\n\nX C\n\nT\n\nQ1 ^-+\n\nO ^+\n\nv\nL\n7\nu-\n\n75-12264\nPage 4-2\n\n\t\ni\n\na\n\n`\t\n\nThe approach selected was also a free piston, differential area pump, but\none that would use the pressure energy of a reduced volume of gas to accelerate\nthe piston mass, while expanding, before the compression load is picked vp.\nThe mechanism selected for accomplishing this objective was an automatic\ncycling valve. This was a differential area unstable valve with tank pressure\nfeedback reset. When closed, a small area senses pressure in a slowly filling,\nfixed volume capacitor chamber. When the pressure reaches a predetermined\nvalue, the valve opens, exposing a larger area to hold the valve open for\ncapacitor discharge. To suppiy increasing energy for pumping as tank pressure\nincreases, tank pressure feedback resets or increases the pressure in the capacitor at which the automatic cycling valve cracks to initiate the pumping cycle.\nThe automatic cycling valve proved to be less than the optimum device from\nthe standpoint of energy management. The pressure drop and time delay through\nthe automatic cycling valve to the motor piston reduced the effective use of\navailable energy.\n4.2.1.2 Constant Pressure Discharge\nAnother approach considered and rejected was to eliminate the mechanical\ncomplexity of a variable energy capacitor by pumping at a constant pressure.\nThis could be accomplished by making the compressor exhaust check valve into a\nfixed pressure relief valve with a setting greater than the maximum tank pressure required. The pump would then compress the gas in the cylinder with no\noutflow until it reached the relief valve setting. It would then complete the\nstroke, delivering gas at that pressure. Therefore, the work with each stroke\nwould not change and a fixed volume capacitor would be designed accordingly.\nThis approach simplifies the mechanization problems, but sacrifices overall cycle efficiency. Pumping efficiency degrades with increasing discharge\npressure, and this concept dictates that all work is done at this minimum\nIt also sacrifices the direct\nefficiency, maximum discharge pressure point. \t\ninitial precharge of the EVA vessel to source pressure or requires the additional complexity of a bypass precharge circuit.\n4.2.1.3 Other Compression Techniques Considered\nAt initiation of the study and as it progressed, other approaches to both\nmotor and compressor were considered, but were eliminated for reasons given in\nthe following discussion.\na.\t\n\nVane, pear, screw,\t and lobe motors and compressors. These device!:\ninherently offer good size and weight-to-power advantages when operated at high speeds, but are not particularly efficient. Additionally,\nthese devices must operate within a narrow speed range to be efficient.\nTherefore, they lack the flexibility to be able to vary oxygen tank\nchanging time.\n\nw w8v AIRESEARCN MANUFACTURING COMPANY \t\n-tat\xe2\x80\x94\nOt CALIFORNIA\t\n\n75-12264\nPage 4-3\n\n\t\n\nIn a single stage, unlubricated device, compression ratios are limited\nto less than three to one, so two stages would be required. Two such\ndevices would be required; one for motor power and another for\ncompression, which would result in greater complexity.\n\n.,\t\n\nb.\t\n\nAxial and centrifugal compressors. The same comments as above apply.\nAlso, compression ratios attainable for current state-of-the-art\ndesigns are even more limited than above.\n\nC.\t\n\nCrank driven reciprocatin g iston compressors. A design was considered with motor piston(s) and compressor piston(s), mounted on a\ncommon crankshaft and valved to provide the desired expansion ratio\nin motor cylinder(s) and compression ratio in compression cylinder(s),\nand phased for balance and load distribution. Mechanical complexity\nwould be greater than the selected approach and would be justified\nonly if high flow capacity were a goal. Multi-staging may be required\nto attain compression ratios greater than 4, to allow intercooling\nto limit peak temperatures,and to improve volumetric efficiency at\nhigh speed when heat trensfer within the compression cylinder would\nnot be adequate.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.\t\n\n4.2.1.4 Alternatives Considered for the Selected Approach\nPrior to the selection of a multiple bellows device to sense pump discharge\npressure and schedule ca p acitor volume, pressure sensing pistons/pushrods were\nconsidered. This is shown on Figure 4-2, which follows. A comparison with\nthe selected approach, which is shown on Figure 2-1, Page 2-3, shows the\nvery significant package improvement of the bellows design. By eliminating\ndynamic seals, which were required on the sensing pistons, the leakage problem\nwas essentially eliminated, as well as friction hysteresis on the accuracy of\nthe scheduling device. The piston-pushrod feedback imposed the inertia and\nfriction of the entire capacitor system on the cyclical action of the capacitor\npiston. The current bellows feedback mechanism has much less mass and, in\naddition, only the capacitor piston cycles, independent of the scheduling\nmechanism. The net effect of the new approach intuitively offers greater\nefficiency\'and is reflected in the analysis section of this report.\nThe bellows design precipitated a reduction in stroke of the scheduling\ndevice and, therefore, of the capacitor piston. Metal bellows are typically\nlimited in stroke, so the capacitor diameter was increased to provide the same\nvolume change. Correspondingly, the spring rate increase resulted in shorter\nsprings with fewer convolutions. Then, by stacking two springs in parallel\nand packaging them within the length generated by the bellows assembly, the\nlength of the overall unit was reduced by more than the total length of the\nprior spring, even with the addition of the pressure switch and adjusting\nmechanism.\n\na^w wcr^\n\nAIRESEARCH MANUFACTURING COMPANY\t\nOF CALIFORNIA\t\n\n75- 12264\nPage 4-4\n\ni\n\nMix\n\n^;\t\n\ni\n\n1\n\ni\n\nI\n\n^^\t\n\nt\n\na\n\nV\n\n^ECZtO ^\n\nFOLDOUT\n\n!t7 AIRESEARCN MANUFACTURING CUMVANV\nOF CALIFORNIA\n\n^^I\n\nx\n\n^Z\t^1\tZ i J ,.\'.J S\t\n\nI\t\n\nA\nI/\n\nI\t\n\n`\n\n0\nx\n\nMS 33649 -9\n\xe2\x80\x94 Ik"LzT\n^,\n\n7\n\nI\n\nAA\n\n:\'^ AT \xe2\x96\xba,t^/^X1 \xe2\x96\xba^^UM C\'S+C^+AiZ^oE P^\n\nNOTES :\nI\t\n\nCORROSION RESIST.

The compression piston contains an integral\npoppet-type inlet valve, which opens to fill the cylinder during the\nreturn or suction stroke. Multiple, teflon, chevron-type seals are\nretained to the piston by a press fit piston end, which also retains\nI ntegral porting in the piston and in the\nthe inlet valve poppet.\t\ncylinder routes supply p ressure to the inlet valve. A set of\nmultiple, teflon chevron-type seals at one end of the cylinder isolates supply pressure from the back side of the motor piston. The\ncompression piston is not rig;dly connected to the moor piston; thus,\n\nAIRESEARCM MANUFACTURING COMPANY \t\nOF CAUIURNIA\t\n\n75-12264\npage 4-6\n\ni\n\nloads that could possibly arise due to concentricity tolerances are\neliminated. Motor pressure and compressor pressure maintain a force\nbalance that insures synchronization of the two pistons at all t",aes.\nDuring the compression stroke, when cylinder pressure exceeds that\nat the outlet port, the exhaust check valve opens and the remainder\nof the swept volume is pumped. The compression piston strokes completely to the end of the cylinder, contacting the check valve before\nit closes to insure an absolute minimum of compressed gas reexpansion\nfor maximum volumetric efficiency. The compressor piston has a\ndiameter of -02 1.014 m (0.399 in.) and a stroke of -02 3.81 m (1.5\nin.) for an L/D ratio of 3.75.\nSupply pressure +06 6.204 Pa (900 psia) entering the compression\nchamber through the inlet check valve provides motive force for the\nreturn or suction stroke. To insure that the exhaust check valve\ncloses properly, its spring is designed to accelerate the mass of the\ncheck valve in the closed direction at a greater rate than the supply\npressure can accelerate the mass of the compressor and motor piston.\nIn this way, no compressed gas reenters the compression chamber before the exhaust check valve closes.\nb.\t\n\nC.\t\n\n-\t\n\nMotor Piston. The motor piston contains two low friction guide seals\nand the seat for the trigger. The motor cylinder contains a set of\ndiametral vent holes which are uncovered by the motor piston at the\nend of the power stroke to vent the power gas to cabin. A second set\nof diametral vent holes at the end of the motor cylinder vent the\nback side of the power piston during the power stroke. A fluorocarbon rubber bumper, bonded to the compression piston retainer,\ncushions the motor piston at end of stroke. A constant flow orifice\nin the motor piston serves to vent motor pressure during the return\nstroke. Because the power and return stroke act very fast, little\nenergy is lost through this orifice. The trigger area and the compressor piston area are similar,which allows triggering over a broad\nrange of supply pressures. The motor vents are connected and a\nsilencer can be added, if it proves necessary.\nCapacitor. The capacitor functions to accumulate energy in the form\n^- gas pressure at a slow rate, as regulated by the metering valve\n(see item e).

This\nled to a comparison of the performance of the two boost pumps. The boost pump\ndiscussed In 75-11603, referred to herein as the "previous" design,was of a\nlarger displacement than the present boost pump. The frequency of oscillation\nof the two boost pumps was normalized by multiplying by the mass of gas compressed during each cycle and dividing by the cabin flow rate. Expressed\nmathematically,\n_ f M0\nf = W , where:\nc\n\nT = non-dimensional frequency\nf = actual frequency of oscillation (Hz)\n1\t\n\nMO = mass of gas displaced during one cycle (lbm)\nWe = cabin flow rate (lbm/s)\nA comparison of f vs tank pressure is shown on Figure 4-6. It is seen\nthat current design oscillates faster at low tank pressures. This was found to\nresult from a more optimum capacitor volume scheduling for the present design\nthan for the previous design. At low pressures, the previous design capacitor\nvolume was excessive,resulting in slow cycle rates and excessive compressor\nspeed at end of stroke. At higher tank pressure, the capacitor volume scheduling is considered to be more nearly optimum,as evidenced by the similarity of\nthe non-dimensionalized frequency curves. For the present design, the capacitor volume vs tank pressure schedule is considered to be optimum for the range\nof tank pressures of 900 to 4000 psia.\nAt tank pressures above 4000 psia, the compressor continues to operate\nwith incomplete stroking until approximately 9000 psia is reached, at which\ntime the boost pump continues oscillating,but does not achieve displacement of\ngas into the tank.\n4.2.3.1.2 Predicted Performance at Low Supply Pressure\nThe predicted performance of the boost pump at a supply pressure of 500\npsia is presented in Figure 4-7. The performance is presented in terms of nondimensional frequency f (as discussed in paragraph 4.2.3.1.1). Performance for\nthree different conditions is shown. Performance at 900 psia is included as a\nreference and is identical to that shown in Figure 4-6. 500 psia performance\nis shown for two conditions. One condition is for the same capacitor scheduling mechanism as was used for the 900 psia supply performance. The other condition is for a capacitor scheduling mechanism which reaches twice the volume\nat a given tank pressure,as did the original scheduling mechanism. The 500.\npsia data for both scheduling mechanisms is significantly degraded from that\nobtained at 900 psia. Two phenomena appear to account for the rifference\nbetween operation at 500 psia and 900 psia:\nI.\t\n\nNon-optimum capacitor scheduling for the 500 psia can s.\n\n2.\t\n\nIncreased overall compression ratio for the 500 psia uses.\n\nLL Z.)\n\nAIRESEARCM MANUFACTURING COMPANY \t\nOF CALIFORNIA\n\n75-12264\nPage 4-17\n\n3\n}\nv\nz\n\nPRESENT DESIGN\n\nW\n\nW\n\n2\n\nW\nJ\nO\nz\nw\t\nVf\n^\n\nPREVIOUS DESIGN\n\n0\nz\n\n0\nz\n0\t\n\n^_\n\n1\t\n\n0\t\n\n1000\t\n\n\t\n\n2000\t\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\nTANK PRESSURE, PSIA\nFigure 4-6.
