This approachhas already\nled to the identificationf propertieswhich were not previously\no\nobservedor\nrecognized. Equallyimportantresultsfrom solar seismologyare expectedin\nthe future.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe relationship\nbetweenvariationsin the sun\'sluminosityand Ion, :arm\nvariations in the earth\'sclimate remains an open question in spi*\nr .onsiderable recent efforts to define it (see referencesI and 2 for a review).\nVariousmethods may be used to studythe solarluminosity-terrestrial\nclimate\nrelationship. One approachto this study that is receivingseriousattention\nis based on the observation long-termvariationscf the solar diameter and\nof\nrelatedquantities. It is in establishing\nthe relationship\nbetween these observables and solar luminosity where the study of solar pulsations can be\nimportant.\nThe fundamental measurements in a diameter-based pro9ram require a\nprecise determination of the location of an edge of the solar disk. This\nlocation,as deducedfrom observation,\ndependson how the edge of the sun is\ndefined. The edge obtainedby any selecteddefinitionis sensitive,in general,to the shapeof the solar limb darkeningfunction. This functionrepresents the decrease in the brightness of the sun as the limb is approached.\nThe sensitivity the edge locationto time-varying\nof\nwhole-diskproperties\nof\nthis function was a factor in the misinterpretationof the Princeton solar\noblateness measurements and later gave rise to equally serious questions\nconcerningthe reality of the solar oscillations reported at SCLERA_. The\nIThls work was supportedin part by the NationalScienceFoundation,\nthe\nAir ForceOfficeof Scientific\nResearch,and the Departmentof Energy.\n2SCLERA is an acronym for the Santa CatalinaLaboratoryfor Experimental\nRelativityby Astrometry,a facilityjointlyoperatedby Wesleyan University\nand the Universityof Arizona.\n229\n\nP;\n\n_-; \'\n\nm,\n=,,,=..__._\n\nexistence of these oscillations has now been corroborated (reference 3) but in\nso doing, new questions have surfaced regarding stellar pulsation theory at a\nfundamental level.\nFor discussions of this topic, see reference 4 for a\nreview on solar oscillations\nand references 5, 6 and 7 for reviews on solar\noblateness.\nThe limb darkening function reflects\nthe temperature gradient in the\nsolar envelope which in turn is evidenced by an outward energy transport,\ni.e.,luminosity. It is clear that a change in the solar luminosity and,\nhence, in the temnorature\ngradientimpliesan accompanying\nchange in the limb\ndarkeningfunctlo,,.\nBecausethe limb darkening_unctlm_can also be studied\nwith considerable\naccuracy, examination its long-termvariationwould be\nan\nof\nexpectedto be as useful a diagnostic the solarluminosityas an intrinsic\nof\ndiameter study alone. In any case, if solar diameter variations are to be\nused to investigate solar luminosity, then the link between changes in the\nlimb darkening function and the observed diameter must be understood at a\nbasic level.\nThe relationship between changes in the limb dar_enlng function and\nluminosity variationsis likely to be complicated. This possibility makes\nadvisable the use of an empirical procedure in which changes in the limb\ndarkening function are examined for correlations with direct radlometric\nmeasurements of the solar constant.This approach ought to be sensitive to\ncorrelations changesin the solarconstantof aboutone part in I0,000with\nin\nperiodson the order of days. This accuracyis fixed by the currentlevel of\nreproducibilityf direct radlometrlc\no\nmeasurements. However, the extrapolation of the empiricalcalibration\nfrom a periodof days to a periodof years\nto decadesis probablynot justified. Accuracyof the extrapolation\nwould be\nfortuitoussince there is no compel_Ingreason to believethat the physical\nprocesses\nleadingto short-termchangesare the same as those underlying\nlongterm changes. This empiricalcalibration\nwould be useful in providingcomparativedata for more analyticwork to follow.\nEffortshave been made to identifythe primarysourcesof possibleluminosity changes by modeling various convection zone effects. The work described in reference 8 exemplifies this approach. Although this work is\nimportant,it models the solarenvelcpein only the simplestmanner, In spite\nof the fact that it is in the envelope that the complicated manifestations\ndiscussed here are observed. A different approach is pursued here -- an\nempirical one in which the effect on observed quantitiesof a change in the\nrate of energy transport through the solar atmosphere is studied without\nconcernfor the origin of the change. Studyingchanges in the limb darkening\nfunction with time and luminosity would be representativeof this type of\napproach. Determining\nthe empiricalparametersof the observables and identifyingthe importantphysicalprocesses\nhas been and remainsa major thrust of\nthe theoretical\nand its associatedobservational\nwork at SCLER_ Studiesof\nthis type are described in references6, 9, I0, II, 12, and 13.\nReference 12 addresses the nonlocal characterof radiative\ntransferin\nthe solaratmosphere. The work shows that this nonlocalcharacteris of primary importancein the treatmentof perturbations f variablesdescribing\no\nthe\nsolar atmosphere. This formalism can be used to calculate the effect of a\n\n230\n\ni\nif\n\n_\n\ndisturbancelike a gravitywave on the limb darkeningfunctionand the lumlnoslty.\n\n"\n\nWork at SCLERAand the SacramentoPeak Observatory\nhas resultedin a new\nobservationaltechnique to study the propertiesof pulsations in the solar\nenvelope {reference13). Use of this technique has led to the discovery of\nfive-minute-periodtraveling waves in the photosphere which are probably\ngravity waves. This discovery is important because ttese waves may significantly affect the relationship between the solar l!_h darkening fur-=tton and\nthe luminosity.\nThe technique utilized\nin this work determines the frequency\nand vertical,\nratherthan horizontal,\nspatialcharacteristics a disturbance\nof\nby employing the observed Doppler shift of a spectral line as a function of\npositionin the absorptionline.\nIntensity\nand displacement\nfIactuations\narise in the essentially\nadiabatic interiorof the sun, but are observedin the nonadlab)tlc\natmosphere. In\nthe photosphere,radiativedamping should be the most importantnonadiabatlc\nprocess, d\'rectly affecting the properties of global oscillations in the\nphotosphere\nwhere they are observedand, for instance,greatlyaffectingthe\npropagation f traveling\no\ndisturbanceswhich may be responsible for heating\nthroughoutthe atmosphere. It is therefore\nnecessary determinewhat types\nto\nof disturbances\noccur in the photosphere\nand to be able to theoretically reat\nt\nthe radiativedampingof such disturbances detail.\nin\nRADIATIVE\nEFFECTS\nThe theoretical\ntreatmontof a disturbance the atmosphereentailsthe\nin\nstudy of the appropriate wave equation.Radiative damping enters th? wave\nequation through the first law of thermodynamics as the heat gained by the\nsystem. Locally,this heat gain per unit time is given by the divergenceof\nthe radiativeenergyflux,\n\nF R" xp(J\n/\n4_\n\n,\n\nwhere FR is the radiative\nflux,p the density,and (_, Jk, and Sk the opacity,\nthe mean intensity,and the source function,respectively,at wavelength k.\nThe opacityand source functionare determinedlocallywhile the mean intensity is affectedby other regionsof the atmosphere. Referencei2 describesa\nmethod for addressing this problem and demonstrates the inadequacyof the\nstandard(andlocal)Newtonlancooling law and the Eddlngton _pproximation.\nThis inadequacy is manifest in their considerable failure to predict the\nradiativedamping of perturbations the photosphere,\nin\nthe place where such\neffectsshouldbe most importantin the llmb darkening\nfunction.\nThe metho(I\ngiven in reference shows that the nonlocalcharacterof the\n12\nmean intensity,in conjunction\nwith the presenceof llne blanketing,\nleads to\na wavelength dependence of the opacity that 4s also important in the calculation of radiative damping incorporating changes in the opacity.\nThis nonlocal\n231\n\napproach yields more realistic spatial properties of disturbances in the solar\natmosphere, allowing an improved comparison between the luminosity and limb\ndarkening function variations. The calculation of these spatial properties is\nbeing pursued at SCLER_\n\nMECHANICAL EFFECTS\n\nMechanical energy flux has been observed in the photosphere (reference\n13). The flux may be of consequence to the relationship between variations in\nthe limb darkening function and luminosity.\nThe observations discussed here were performed at the Sacramento Peak\nObservatory. The data are high resolution line profiles of the 5434 _ Fe I\nline, which is a nonmagnetic line spanning the photosphere. By examining the\nDoppler shifts closer and closer to the bottom of the absorption line, the\nvelocities of the disturbances are resolved at nine successively higher altitudes in the photosphere. These velocity data are filtered to examine power\nin the five-minute-periodwindow.\nCalculations using the filtered data reveal that there is a disturbance\nin the five-minute-periodwindow in addition to the well-known five-minuteperiod acoustic mode. The secondary disturbance is ,_oundto be traveling\nwaves which have ingoing and outgoing phase velocities. For both the ingoing\nand the outgoing traveling waves, power is observed for vertical wavelengths\nwhich are about 4/3 times the height of the atmosphere spanned by the observations. Longer wavelengths may be present but the current work has considerably reduced sensitivity in that region. Taking the height of the photosphere\nspanned by the observations to be 400 km, the vertical wavelength for both\ningoing and outgoing phases is approximately 530 km. The period of these\ntraveling waves is 278 \xc2\xb1 41 seconds and their vertical phase velocity is about\n2 km/sec.\n\n.\n-\n\nIf the observed traveling waves comprise only a small portion of their\nspatial spectrum or if the waves are not localized, the group of waves which\nthey represent may provide an important net vertical energy flux to the lower\nchromosphere. This flux, which may be as large a_ 10_ ergs/cm2/sec, could\nhave implications for the relationshipbetween the limb darkening function and\nsolar luminosity. The horizontal extent of the traveling waves reported here\nis currently under investigation.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nI.\n\nWhite, O. R., ed.
