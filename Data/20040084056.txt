It is responsible for Agency wide technical\nstandards development, adoption (endorsement), and conversion of Center-unique\nstandards for Agency wide use. One major element of the Program is the review of NSA\ntechnical standards products and replacement with non-Government Voluntary\nConsensus Standards in accordance with directions issued by the Office of Management\nand Budget. As part of the Program\xe2\x80\x99s function, it developed a NASA Integrated\nTechnical Standards Initiative that consists of and Agency wide full-text system,\nstandards update notification system, and lessons learned\xe2\x80\x94standards integration system.\nThe Program maintains a \xe2\x80\x9cone stop-shop\xe2\x80\x9d Website for technical standards ad related\ninformation on aerospace materials, etc. This paper provides information on the\ndevelopment, current status, and plans for the NAS Technical Standards Program along\nwith metrics on the utility of the products provided to both users within the nasa.gov\nDomain and the Public Domain.\nNASA TECHNICAL STANDARDS PROGRAM\n\nThe NASA Technical Standards Program (http://standards.nasa.gov) was formally\nestablished in 1997 as an Agencywide effort by direction of the Administrator. It has the\nfollowing principal elements:\n***Increase NASA Use of Voluntary Consensus (non-Government) Technical Standards.\n***Selective Development of NASA-Unique Technical Standards.\n***Develop and Promote the Use of an Integrated Technical Standards Initiative (FullText Standards Access, Standards Update Notifications, and Lessons\nLearned\xe2\x80\x94Standards Integration).\n***Exploit the Potential of Web-based Standardization Information.\nTechnical Standards are an integral part of all engineering development efforts, especially\nthose in the aerospace industry. Designers and engineers should be among the most\naggressive supporters of a strong Technical Standards program. Standardization activities\nestablish engineering and technical applications for processes and practices and, in doing\n\n1\n\nso, enhance engineering capabilities. Thus, they enable designers to not dissipate their\nenergies on the costly exercise of \xe2\x80\x9creinventing the wheel.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLike their colleagues in the private sector, NASA has also depended upon the active\napplication of Technical Standards developed by the Agency through its various Centers,\nas well as Department of Defense (DoD) Technical Standards (i.e., Military Standards,\nSpecifications, Handbooks, etc.) and those produced by non-Government Standards\nDeveloping Organizations (SDOs). Since the late 1990s, NASA has been engaged in a\nmajor Agencywide effort to review the Technical Standards produced by its Centers and,\nto the degree practical, utilizes a systematic consensus driven approach resulting in the\nadoption (endorsement) of relevant non-Government Technical Standards to replace its\nCenter-developed Technical Standards. The adopted Technical Standards are known as\n\xe2\x80\x9cNASA Preferred Technical Standards.\xe2\x80\x9d In areas where adoption is not practical, efforts\nhave been made to consolidate similar Center-developed Technical Standards and\nproduce replacement Technical Standards endorsed for Agencywide use. This substantial\nendeavor was undertaken and subsequently increased in response to the Office of\nManagement and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119 \xe2\x80\x9cFederal Participation in the\nDevelopment and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment\nActivities\xe2\x80\x9d, February 1998.\nIn the process of responding to the directives contained in OMB Circular A-119, it was\ndiscovered that the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s Programs/Projects and engineering staff were in need of a\nconsolidated Web-based Technical Standards database accessible from a single source\nwith engineering oversight. The information requested included full-text Technical\nStandards products issued by the Agency and its Centers, Department of Defense, and\nnon-Government SDOs. In addition, requirements for timely information on changes in\nTechnical Standards products were also noted.\nThe need for improving the process to address customer needs for efficiency in the\nacquisition of Technical Standards products is one of the Strategic Initiatives identified in\nthe American National Standards Institute\xe2\x80\x99s (ANSI) National Standards Strategy For The\nUnited States (http://web.ansi.org/public/nss.html). In particular the document identified\nthe need for cost-effective mechanisms such as update notification and electronic\naccessibility of Technical Standards products from SDOs. The NASA Integrated\nTechnical Standards Initiative, while not developed to solve this problem for the United\nStates, is a step toward solving the problem of Technical Standards distribution and, thus,\nenhancement of engineering capabilities within one Government Agency that has\npotential for use by others.\nAfter several reviews and pilot exercises, additional dialog with several Program/Project\nManagers and engineering groups, the concept of a \xe2\x80\x9cOne Stop Shop\xe2\x80\x9d web-based NASA\nIntegrated Technical Standards Initiative began to materialize. The two main advantages\nthat became immediately apparent were: (1) The Agency\xe2\x80\x99s engineering capabilities will\nbe considerably enhanced by providing NASA\xe2\x80\x99s technical and engineering communities\nwith immediate on-line access to Technical Standards products and (2) Significant cost\nsavings could be realized by having one unified Agencywide Full-Text Technical\n\n2\n\nStandards System versus having fourteen or more individual groups within the Agency\nacquiring Technical Standard products independent of each other. Standards updates and\nlessons learned were also indicated as important information to enhance the engineering\nusage of Technical Standards. Thus, the unique \xe2\x80\x9cNASA Integrated Technical Standards\nInitiative\xe2\x80\x9d was born. The Initiative consists of the following three Systems:\n(1) Agencywide Full-Text Technical Standards System\n(2) Standards Update Notification System\n(3) Lessons Learned/Best Practices/Application Notes\xe2\x80\x94Standards Integration\nSystem.\nThe primary goal of the NASA Technical Standards Initiative is to develop a suite of\ncollaborative tools to: (1) Augment NASA\xe2\x80\x99s use and support the adoption of nonGovernment Voluntary Consensus Standards by making them available from a single\nsource, (2) Provide notifications on changes, updates, and revisions to existing Technical\nStandards, (3) Provide information on engineering lessons learned, best practices, and\nexperiences related to specific Technical Standards products, and (4) Enhance the\nengineering capabilities of the Agency. Technical Standards provide a major opportunity\nto achieve the goal of enhancing engineering capabilities, especially when a process such\nas the NASA Integrated Technical Standards Initiative is implemented. This Initiative\nconsists of the following Systems.\nAgencywide Full-Text Technical Standards System\nThis System provides access to full-text on-line Technical Standards products and\ndistribution for NASA use. Technical Standards products are currently available from\n108 Standards Developing Organizations, including those of NASA, DoD, and other\nAgencies. For those Technical Standards not available electronically, a hardcopy is made\navailable to the requester within 24-36 hours. A pilot version of the System was\nimplemented in 2000 with favorable feedback leading to the Agencywide implementation\nof the System in June 2001. Currently their are over 5,500 registered NASA and\nsupporting contractor users within the <nasa.gov> Domain.\nStandards Update Notification System\nThis System provides NASA and its supporting contractors with notice of updates\n(revisions, cancellations, superseded documents, etc.) to Technical Standards products\nthat they have identified for use on their Programs/Projects or research activities. This\ninformation is provided so that update notices of technical changes on a Technical\nStandards product can be evaluated by the Program/Project Manager for impact on the\nProgram/Project requirements. This System is linked with the Agencywide Full-Text\nTechnical Standards System to provide the latest full-text versions of the Technical\nStandards on demand. Documents identified by the user and accepted for update\nnotification are screened relative to adoption as NASA Preferred Technical Standards.\n\n3\n\nThe System was made available Agencywide in October 2001. There are now over 4,000\nstandards documents registered by users for update notifications.\nLessons Learned/Best Practices/Application Notes\xe2\x80\x94Standards Integration System\nThis System provides links to Lessons Learned/Best Practices/Application Notes that\nhave applicability to use of individual Technical Standards products. As of this date, 225\nLessons Learned from NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Lessons Learned Information System have been linked to\n125 NASA Preferred Technical Standards listed on the NASA Technical Standards\nProgram Website. Also, 140 Application Notes have been related to 95 NASA Preferred\nTechnical Standards. Identifying other Application Notes and Lessons Learned to link\nwith specific NASA Preferred Technical Standards is a continuing effort. These Lessons\nLearned, Best Practices, and Application Notes will also be of great benefit in identifying\nnon-Government Voluntary Consensus Standards to adopt/endorse for NASA use. Over\n150 links to engineering Lessons Learned/Best Practices Websites and documents have\nbeen identified and provided on the Program\xe2\x80\x99s Website. These additional sites are not\nonly from NASA Facilities, but other Government and non-Government bodies. They\nprovide users with technical information on a variety of aerospace engineering related\nlessons learned topics. The NASA Technical Standards Program Office prepared a paper\nentitled \xe2\x80\x9cLessons Learned and Technical Standards\xe2\x80\x94A Logical Marriage\xe2\x80\x9d that was\npublished in the November 2001 issue of ASTM Standardization News and subsequently\nreprinted in DOD Standardization Journal and The Standards Forum of DOE. It focuses\non the importance of the relationship between Lessons Learned and Technical Standards,\nand, thus, the enhancement of engineering capabilities.\nAn example is provided of what a NASA staff member or supporting contractor user of\nthe NASA Technical Standards Program Website has available. It is shown on the figure\nof the document Summary Page. When the user calls up a NASA Preferred Technical\nStandard under the Agencywide Full-Text Technical Standards System, a document\nSummary Page will appear that provides summary information on the Technical\nStandard. When available, information on applicable Application Notes, Lessons Learned\nand Best Practices is provided along with link to the Standards Update Notification\nSystem to receive notice of any revisions, updates, cancellations, etc. on a given\nTechnical Standard.\nConclusion\nFigure one provides a view of the NASA Technical Standards Program Website\nHomepage. On it the NASA ACCESS and PUBLIC ACCESS menu items are noted\nalong with some allied menu topics. To date, the usage of the three Systems in the NASA\nTechnical Standard Initiative has been outstanding in terms of user interests and value to\ntheir work on NASA Programs/Projects and research activities. The metrics associated\nwith each of these Systems continue to show increased usage. This is due to the ready\navailability of the NASA Technical Standards Program products and related information\non-line, and reinforces the validity of the \xe2\x80\x9cOne Stop-Shop\xe2\x80\x9d concept.\n\n4\n\nThe integration of Technical Standards, update notifications, and lessons learned\ninformation is one step toward the goal of significantly enhancing engineering\ncapabilities necessary to meet the future demands of the Agency for timely, productive,\nand reliable space systems and contributing to improved cost.\nFigures two and three provide an overview on the current focus and future thrusts of the\nNASA Technical Standards Program. The conversion of Center-developed standards to\nNASA Preferred Technical Standards and adoption of non-Government standards\nremains a key focus of the Program. Improving the awareness of the Program and its\nproducts among the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s staff and supporting contractors continues to be a\nchallenge. Promoting the development of new standards that will serve the Agency is a\ncurrent initiative, capitalizing on new technology and experiences. Future thrusts will\ninclude additional efforts on the integration of lessons learned with technical standards.\nNew venues will be explored relative to how the Program\xe2\x80\x99s products can better contribute\nto the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s engineering capabilities and the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOne NASA\xe2\x80\x9d initiative.\nBibliography\nGill, P.
