O\'Connor,\n\nPROTECTION\n\nJr.\n\nDouglas Aircraft Company\nMcDonnell Douglas Corporation\n\nIn recent years there has been a substantial\nincrease in regulatory\nattention in the area of rotor fragment protection.\nConcern appears to\nstem primarily\nfrom an apparent nearly constant per year occurrence of\nincidents involving uncontained\nfragments, large fan blade masses of the\nlarge high bypass ratio turbofans, and degree of secondary damage produced\nin some instances.\nIncrease emphasi[ is evident from NASA and FAA activities\nincluding their sponsorship\nof some industry activities.\n\nr\n\nIt is essential\nthat the containment\nquestion be examined in the correct\nperspective.\nThe commercial\nrecord is a fairly convincing argument\nthat\nthe requirements\nand practices\nin place today are reasonably\neffective.\nSince Douglas\' entry into the jet transport field in 1956, two hulls have\nbeen lost and a single fatality incurred in a third incident involving\nrotor/blade\nfailures.\nIn none would additional "armor" isolation, or\nredundancy have affected the outcome.\nHowever, this is not to imply that\nthere is no room for improvement.\nSome ideas that may provide insight\ninclude review of key controlling\nrequirements,\narmor as a brute force\napproach, and an integrated airframe and engine solution.\nAs part of the approach to rotor/blade\nfragment protection,\nkey airworthiness design criteriaconsiderations\nfor fragment protection\nare reviewed.\nVarious FAA requirements\nin FAR Parts 25 and 33, plus interpretive\n8110\norders, deal with engine and installation\nrequirements\nspecifically\naimed\nat minimizi,_g this type of hazard.\nThese requirements\ncover such features\nand design areas as engine isolation, containment\nof damage from rotor blade\nfailures, containment\nof fire, and design of other features of the aircraft\nto permit continued flight and safe landing in the event of more serious\nengine failures.\nArmor represents one end of the spectrum of protection approaches.\nAn FAA\nsponsored study is in process at Douglas to evaluate the impact of providing aircraft armor in lieu of engine armor for typical 3 and 4 engine wide\nbodied transports.\nThe initial area of discussion\ndeals with protection\nwithin the length of the engine case.\nProtection\nfrom fragments exiting\nahead of the engine inlet flange has some unique considerations\nand is\ntherefore treated separately.\n\n:\n\n\'\n\n/\n\n\'\n\nFor protection\nwithin\nplus fuel burned
