If you try to provide for dual turbopumps to do this, you may have a\nvery complex systeminvolving a number of valves that can isolate the pumping, or that\ncan also get the pumps to share the load equally.\nIn Figure 8, which we have patterned after our experiencesin Nevada,we had actual\nflow pumps that had negative HQ curves. That kind of a systemis inherently selfbalancing. The pumps share the load equally.\nWe have done it here by picking a design point that is closeto the design specific speed\nline, but is far enough over from the predicted stall region so we can actually throttle at\nfull temperature down to 50 percent. This is the value that I assumedin my example. It\nalso represents the kind of limit that the reactor people are comfortable ,,fith in terms of\nhaving full temperature, but reduced coolant flow going through. If you suffered a\nfailure of a turbopump, you would move to a new operating point out to the right, where\nthe developed head and the flow rate intersect with the reactor load line.\nThis example showsan ability to meet that requirement, but notice that we are getting\nclose to what was called a negative flow incidence. That\'s the caseon the inducer at the\nfront end of the pump where the flow incidence angleson the impeller, the front end of\nthe impeller, goes negative, and then your NPSH requirements come up. So if you want\nto try to operate this pump at 70 percent thrust (for reasonsof retrieval on your mission)\nand you want to operate with negative NPSH, it may be necessaryto add a boost pump\nthat would be hydraulically driven so you could match the speedto give you the proper\nincidence angle.\nFigure 9 is a cartoon of one version of the pump that could do this. In this particular\ncasewe have patterned it after what we did on the Mark 25. The design incorporates\nhybrid hydrostatic bearings, at the outboard end of the turbine, which were proven in\nNevada to be able to operate in a very satisfactory manner.\nWe wanted to go for the hydrostatic bearing to get rid of any materials that were in the\nbearings or anywhere else in this turbopump that would suffer any kind of damage from\nthe intense nuclear environment that we anticipated. Those bearings actually provided\nthe meansof doing that, and they worked.\nWe also tested an advancedinducer which actually went up in flow capacity by 50\npercent area. It was made out of titanium so that we could keep the weight overhang off\nthe stub of the shaft reasonable,to maintain a critical speedwhere we wanted it. We\nalso reduced the incidence angle, a design Q over N, to about 1.5 degrees,and we tested\nit. We found that we were able to ingest not only a saturated liquid going into the\npump, but we kept going and we found that we could ingest up to 30 percent vapor and\n\n97\n\nstill the pump put out full pressure.\nIf that can be realized in a flight system,it enablesus to pump a saturated fluid from a\ntank. The other thing we haveshown is a single stageturbine over at the drive end. We\ncould play the gamesof going to two stagesthere, take the pressure ratio and adjust it\nacrosseach stageand make more effective utilization of the turbine drive fluid,\ndepending upon the temperature that we are able to put into that drive fluid by the tie\ntube circuitry. So, we have some flexibility there.\nWe have also looked at integrated, pneumatic fluidics control systemsto come up with a\ncontrol systemthat would enable us to operate the entire engine in an intense radiation\nenvironment (see figure 10). Basedupon the development work that was accomplished,\nit looks like we could do it. In other words, it would not be necessaryto shield this\nengine from anything it doesto itself radiation-wise. If you want to put a shield in this\nengine, it would be to protect the crew, but not becausethe engine requires it.\nFigure 11 showsthe final version of what an expandercycle engine systemwould look\nlike in terms of its operating conditions. This particular setup allows us to meet the\nrequirements I talked about, except that we are talking here about a weight of about\n18,000pounds and not 14,000pounds.\nHow do we get that thrust-to-weight ratio up? Obviously most of the weight is in the\nreactor, but there may be a limit to what can be done there to make the weight as low as\nyou would like to. There is another way to get that thrust-to-weight ratio up, and that is\nto get more thrust out of this configuration. And the thing that determines what you can\nget out of this engine is not the design of the pumps, not the design of the nozzle, but\nthe power density in the fuel elements.\nThis particular design at 100 K has a power density of 1 megawatt per fuel element,\nwhich was actually demonstratedin the Phoebusprogram. There are some indications\nthat you can get as high as 1 and a quarter megawattsper fuel element. That would\nraise the same engine to 125,000pounds of thrust. That\'s the route that you need to\nexamine: how hard you can push the fuel elements in power density for a given outlet\ntemperature and a given total operating time?\n"\n\n98\n\nTYPICAL MANNED MARS MISSION\nNTR PROPULSION REQUIREMENTS\n\n.\n\nTHRUST,\n\nNOMINAL\n\n100,000 LBF\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\n> 900 SEC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMAXIMUM\n\n< 14,000 LBS (WITHOUT\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFULL PERFORMANCE\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEMERGENCY\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNPSH(MIN)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMAXIMUM\n\nOPERATING\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNUMBER\n\nOFRESTARTS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTRANSITION,\n\nFLOW INITIATION\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTRANSITION,\n\n50% THRUST TO CUT-OFF\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMAXIMUM\n\nWEIGHT\nOPERATING\n\nRANGE\n\n110% _\n\nSHIELD)\n\n50%\n\n70%\n\nTHRUST (W ONE PUMP OUT)\n\nONE VELOCITY HEAD FROM\nSATURATED\nLIQUID IN TANK\nTIME\n\n2 HOURS\n_>6\n\nCORE TEMPERATURE,\n\nTO FULL THRUST\n\n30 SEC\n30 SEC\n\nAFTER\n\nHEAT\n\n1800\xc2\xb0R\nFigure\n\nI\n\nPerformance* of NTR Operating with\nHigh Pressure Hydrogen\n\n56OO\n\n1\n\xc2\xb8\n"Gas\n\n5400\n\nkinetics,\n\nj nozzle boundary\nlayer\nlose= end divergence\nB:\n\neffect=\n\nIncluded,\n\n-!\n\nE\no\np-\n\n5000\n\n4100\n\n/,y\n460O\nm\n\n1000\n\n92o\nSpecific\n\nImpulse\n\n99\n\n1040\n\n: Seconds\n\nFigure\n\n2\n\nNTR\n\nExpander\n\nCycles\n\n(Typical)\n\n\\\nCONFIGURATION\n\nA\n\nCONFIGURATION\n\nRover/Nerva\n\nB\n\nFigure\n\n3\n\nFigure\n\n4\n\nCore-Reactor\n\nACTUATOR\n\nFUEL\n\nELEMENT\n\nINTERNAL\nNUCLEAR\n\nSUIISVSTF_M\n\n100\n\nSIIIELi!\n\nASSEMBLY\n\nNTR THRUST NOZZ1J_\nCARBON/CARBON COMPOSITE {SIC)\nRADIATION NOZZI_E WALL TEMPERATURE\n035 inchThckWai\nK\n\n;,3.47\n\nEmts_\n\n10 4\n\nBtu/m\n\nI\nsec\n\nR\n\n- 09Z\n\nI\n\n\\\n\n4000\'\n\xc2\xa2C\n\nI,M\n\xc2\xa2L\n\n30(30\'\n\n=!\n\n_\'_\'_-..._\n\nINSIDE\n\n1000\'\n100\n\n200\n\n300\nAREA\n\nRATIO\n\n400\n\n500\n\nA/A"\n\n7rJ/lm\n\nFigure\n\ni\nI\n\nl\n\ni\n\n;\n\nI \' i\n\nI\n\ni:\ni _!\n\n)0\n\nl_ ols.__/_6\n\nr\n\n5C.\n\n,\n\n1(i01:\nr\xc2\xa2TR)THRUST\nCHef\'Eft\nTHERII,aJ_\nDESIGN PARAMETERS\nl\n;\n;\ni\nI\ni\n\ni\n\n;\n\ni "Ai\'S"R\'Opu\'sIo"\n,\n\n5\n\n,I\n\n.. l_ZlO\ni\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n15O0\n\n"i,ii\'l\n\nI,.\n\n.,:\n\nI\n!,\n\n:i\n\ni:?x\n\n1 .....\na"IZO0\n_:t \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_4\n\ni L:|,.-,\n\n_i\'\n\n\'\n\n-Q1000\nI:il_\n\n: __ _i"\n\n,\n\n!\n\n-,!!\'I!\n!\n.ill A.. 1 !j_\'\nI:?F"\ni\n\ni1\ni, lil,\n; .l:.\n\n=\n\nlc :_I-_t0@ \xc2\xb0\n\nII _o\n":l _\n\n\xc2\xa2"\n\n.,\n\ni:\n\n"I\n\n:_0\n\n" I\n\ni\n\n40\n\n_\n\n6o\n\n1 80\n\n!\n\ni\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n:\n\ni\n\ni\n\n!\nI.\n\n\'\n\n_ii!!:F\n\nI\n10]\n\ni\n\n: : \'\ni\n\n,\n\nI\n\n_I\n\n100\n\n!\n\n14\xc2\xb0! ,\n\nI\nFigure\n\n6\n\n_-\n\n28\n\nFEET\nAREA\nRA;mO\n.SOO\n\nA_A\nP,AT_\n\nt4\n\nFEET\n\nDIA.\n\n100K NTR NOZZLE\n\nASSEMBLY\nFigure\n\nCANDIDATE\n\nDUAL\n\nPUMP\n\nOPERATING\n\n7\n\nMAP\n\n100K NTR ENGINE\n70\n\nI\n\ndesign Ns\n60\n\nagn poinL\n\n5O\nC3\n(\nO\nv=4\n_4\n\nAive flow\ndence\n4O\n\nc_ 3O\n39,875\n\n2O\n\nrpm\n\nI0\n37.542\ni\n2\n\n4\nFLOWRATE,\n\n102\n\nrpm\n\nt N=25.\n6\nGPM\n\n8\n\n10\n\nX 10"3\n\nFigure\n\n8\n\nSCALED\n\n5\n\nSINGLE\n\nSTAGE\n\nSTAGE\n\nMK25\n\nPUMP\n\nEXPANDER\n\nPUMP\n\nFLOWRATE\n\nRPM\n\nTURBINE\n\n37,500\n\nPUMP\n\nINLET\n\n54\n\nDIAMETER\n\nI.B/SEC\n\n5.71\n\nIN.\n\nFigure\n\nNTR\n\nInputs\n\n/\n\n_Sequ\n\nIntegrated\nControl\n\nIntegrated\n\nPneumatic-Fluidics\nSystem\n\nControl\n\n:nce[Pressure,_7\n\nLogic\n\nm[\n\n_-_Fil\n\n_ _Control_\n_\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\',1\n\nA--.\n\n:iiPropeliant_\n_\nValve\n-_-_ _,_ ,._,_,,,ar\'r"\n\nL\n_r\'--\n\n_Sensor_!l\n\n_\' /\n\n._._\n\nurbine_\nValve ,\'q\n\nPrototype\nConcepts\n\nor breadboard\nevolved\n\nor\n\nunits\navailable\n\nIn tab\n\n_:i:!Temperature_\':\'\n\nL.\n\n/\n\n.\n\n9\n\n100K FLIGHT\n\nTwak_\n, .....
