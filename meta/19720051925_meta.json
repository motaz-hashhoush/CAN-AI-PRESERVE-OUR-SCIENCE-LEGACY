The spikes may be divided  into three distinct populations, depending on whether they occur at latitudes below, at, or above the local limit of trapping. These spikes are designated type 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Type 3 spikes occur  in a narrow latitude band about 3 deg wide, centered at invariant latitude Lambda approximately equal to 78 deg at 1000 MLT (magnetic local time) and 68 deg at 2000 MLT. Type 3 spikes appear to be associated with spikes observed near the magnetopause and the neutral sheet. Type 2 spikes also occur in a latitude band about 3 deg wide, centered  at about 71 deg at 1000 MLT and 67 deg at 2200 MLG. Type 2 spikes appear to be related to island fluxes in the neutral sheet, although they occur on closed field lines and may persist for many hours. Type 1  spikes occur in a wider band of latitudes, from about 62 deg to 68 deg near midnight and 66 deg to 68 deg near noon. Although they are observed on closed field lines, type 1 spikes do not persist for periods longer than about 1 hour, and it is concluded that they are produced by strong pitch-angle scattering from the stably trapped population.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "77", "submissionId": 19720051925, "id": "d4d6fa6c7772486b88949bc17a3bdcd7", "publicationName": "Journal of Geophysical Research", "publicationDate": "1972-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
