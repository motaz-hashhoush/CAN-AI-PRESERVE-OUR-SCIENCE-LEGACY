Initially integrated into the Space Shuttle by Rockwell International, production was transferred to Hi-Temp Insulation Inc. in 1974. Over the years, Hi-Temp has created many new technologies to meet the requirements of the Space Shuttle program. This expertise is also used commercially, including insulation blankets to cover aircrafts parts, fire barrier material to protect aircraft engine cowlings and aircraft rescue fire fighter suits. A Fire Protection Division has also been established, offering the first suit designed exclusively by and for aircraft rescue fire fighters. Hi-Temp is a supplier to the Los Angeles City Fire Department as well as other major U.S. civil and military fire departments.", "title": "Reusable Surface Insulation", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020076129, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020076129, "isbn": "0-16-049155-X", "id": "487028b25af84bdf8ed35a96307ee96f", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1997", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19970041341, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1997: 25 Years of Reporting Down-to-Earth Benefits", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020076129.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020076129/downloads/20020076129.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020076129/downloads/20020076129.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020076129/downloads/20020076129.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
