The orbiter, main engine, and solid rocket boosters will be reusable. The Shuttle will be able to abort ascent and return the orbiter plus payload to the launch site if necessary. Mission capabilities include a 7-30 day duration, crew of 4-7 (with 1-4 payload specialists), and 14,500-29,500 kg payloads. Payload accommodations, including cabin, crew provisions, pointing and position stability, thermal constraints, electric power, communications, payload deployment and retrieval, contamination control, and kits for extended missions, are considered. The Thermal Protection System, utilizing pyrolized carbon and  silica tiles, is described. The Space Shuttle Main Engine design and  performance are considered and compared to those of the J-2 engine used on Saturn/Apollo missions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Netherlands", "submissionId": 19750029639, "endDate": "1974-10-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Astronautical Federation"}}, "meetingId": "6bebaaede53141a8a2f423c5a3920ff2", "id": "e4b6665a094b4fdeba1a49d70242c512"}], "name": "International Astronautical Federation, International Astronautical Congress", "location": "Amsterdam", "id": "6bebaaede53141a8a2f423c5a3920ff2"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750029639, "id": "1760354ed9ab4672b9a752195fc8e3ba", "publicationDate": "1974-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
