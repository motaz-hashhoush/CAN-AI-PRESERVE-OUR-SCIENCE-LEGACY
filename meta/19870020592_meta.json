Mechanical simulation studies of these muscle cells in a newly developed mechanical cell simulator can now be performed to study growth processes in skeletal muscle. Conditions in the mechanical cell simulator were defined where mechanical activity can either prevent muscle wasting or stimulate muscle growth. The role of endogenous and exogenous growth factors in tension-induced muscle growth is being investigated under the defined conditions of tissue culture.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870020592, "id": "8369ec9e6b3e4b46a8aed4982f07e86c", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19870020592.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19870020592/downloads/19870020592.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19870020592/downloads/19870020592.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19870020592/downloads/19870020592.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
