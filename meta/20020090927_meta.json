The method has been successful and the company estimates its annual savings as a quarter million dollars.", "title": "Fabric Manufacturing", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020090927, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020090927, "id": "5ce2e7ca2afe404da2164a64d3e52e4c", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1986", "publicationDate": "1986-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020090927.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020090927/downloads/20020090927.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020090927/downloads/20020090927.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020090927/downloads/20020090927.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
