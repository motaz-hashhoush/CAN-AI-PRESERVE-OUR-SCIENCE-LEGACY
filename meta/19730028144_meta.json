During the recent sunspot maximum, new AFSs appeared at a rate of nearly one per day over the entire sun. Evidence is presented for two proposed hypotheses, namely: (1) a twist in the flux tubes of new AFSs is a key factor in determining which new AFSs will grow; and (2) this twist is related to the well-known asymmetry of sunspot groups.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "177", "submissionId": 19730028144, "id": "ef173d7ae96e48f58b6bcdf25acb18f3", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal", "publicationDate": "1972-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
