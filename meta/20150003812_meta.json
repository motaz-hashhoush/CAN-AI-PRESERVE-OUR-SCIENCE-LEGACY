Typical engineering imagery assessments include studying and characterizing the liftoff and ascent debris environments; launch vehicle and propulsion element performance; in-flight activities; and entry, landing, and recovery operations. Integration 2 support has been provided not only for U.S. Government spaceflight (e.g., Space Shuttle, Ares I-X) but also for commercial launch providers, such as Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) and Orbital Sciences Corporation, servicing the International Space Station. The NASA Integration 2 Team is composed of imagery integration specialists from JSC, the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), who have access to a vast pool of experience and capabilities related to program integration, deployment and management of imagery assets, imagery data management, and photogrammetric analysis. The Integration 2 team is currently providing integration services to commercial demonstration flights, Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1), and the Space Launch System (SLS)-based Exploration Missions (EM)-1 and EM-2. EM-2 will be the first attempt to fly a piloted mission with the Orion spacecraft. The Integration 2 Team provides the customer (both commercial and Government) with access to a wide array of imagery options - ground-based, airborne, seaborne, or vehicle-based - that are available through the Government and commercial vendors. The team guides the customer in assembling the appropriate complement of imagery acquisition assets at the customer's facilities, minimizing costs associated with market research and the risk of purchasing inadequate assets. The NASA Integration 2 capability simplifies the process of securing one-of-a-kind imagery assets and skill sets, such as ground-based fixed and tracking cameras, crew-in the-loop imaging applications, and the integration of custom or commercial-off-the-shelf sensors onboard spacecraft. For spaceflight applications, the Integration 2 Team leverages modeling, analytical, and scientific resources along with decades of experience and lessons learned to assist the customer in optimizing engineering imagery acquisition and management schemes for any phase of flight - launch, ascent, on-orbit, descent, and landing. The Integration 2 Team guides the customer in using NASA's world-class imagery analysis teams, which specialize in overcoming inherent challenges associated with spaceflight imagery sets. Precision motion tracking, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) photogrammetry, image stabilization, 3D modeling of imagery data, lighting assessment, and vehicle fiducial marking assessments are available. During a mission or test, the Integration 2 Team provides oversight of imagery operations to verify fulfillment of imagery requirements. The team oversees the collection, screening, and analysis of imagery to build a set of imagery findings. It integrates and corroborates the imagery findings with other mission data sets, generating executive summaries to support time-critical mission decisions.", "title": "Imagery Integration Team", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2015-03-27T17:06:27.3130000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20150003812, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Calhoun, Tracy"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "979a954f27a34800b999f6b8db79cffa"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20150003812, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Melendrez, Dave"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "6b6ecbc1154f4b6f9369efac866d6f78"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20150003812, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150003812, "id": "0f8ea5df66834a04890242bc1cd6bb75", "publicationName": "ARES Biennial Report 2012 Final", "publicationDate": "2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20140011750, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "ARES Biennial Report 2012 Final", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150003812.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150003812/downloads/20150003812.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150003812/downloads/20150003812.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150003812/downloads/20150003812.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
