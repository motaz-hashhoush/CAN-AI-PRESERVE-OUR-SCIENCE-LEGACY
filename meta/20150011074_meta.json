These include: (1) unexpected shock from Solar Array deployment, (2) momentum buildup from the Magnetic Torquer Bars (MTBs) phasing errors, (3) transition into Safehold due to albedo induced Course Sun Sensor (CSS) anomaly, and (4) a flight software error that could cause a Safehold transition due to a Star Tracker occultation. This paper will discuss ways GN&C engineers identified the anomalies and tracked down the root causes. Flight data and GN&C on-board models will be shown to illustrate how each of these anomalies were investigated and mitigated before causing any harm to the spacecraft. On May 29, 2014, GPM was handed over to the Mission Flight Operations Team after a successful commissioning period. Currently, GPM is operating nominally on orbit, collecting meaningful scientific data that will significantly improve our understanding of the Earth's climate and water cycle.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150011074, "endDate": "2015-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronautical Society", "location": "Springfield, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "e63e864205844c928b1776e030d3de40", "id": "2681cc9edbfc4ceab5aa85f02ecfe0ac"}], "name": "Annual AAS (American Astronautical Society) Guidance and Control Conference", "location": "Breckenridge, CO", "id": "e63e864205844c928b1776e030d3de40", "startDate": "2015-01-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150011074, "id": "199f7c62c7bf443da0a041ee10bdfd4a", "publicationDate": "2015-01-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20150008352, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Global Precipitation Measurement Mission Launch and Commissioning", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150011074.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150011074/downloads/20150011074.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150011074/downloads/20150011074.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150011074/downloads/20150011074.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
