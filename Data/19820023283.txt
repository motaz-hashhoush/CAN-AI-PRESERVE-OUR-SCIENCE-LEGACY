Sanchez Pena\nChairman of the National Commission of Space Research\nArgentine Republic\n/1*\nDuring the first decade of the Space Era important practical \t\napplications of the investigation of space were developed and tested\nwhich are of immediate benefit to mankind. The discussions carried\nout up to now indicate that these practical applications might provide\na material co_tribution to alleviate some of the economic and social\nproblems which arise as a consequence of the explosive demographic\ngrowth, the serious shortage of food and the propagation of diseases,\nproblems which in themselves are a source of considerable worry for\nmost of mankind.\nAt the same time it was emphasized that the elements and instruments which are involved in the investigations of extraterrestrial\nspace through the complex, costly and specialized nature and known\nonly to some nations.\nThe advances in space science and technology have been of benefit\nso far to most of the countries who are already at the head of the\nworld economic system. The Space Era is increasing at an alarming\nrate the abyss already existing between the developed and the developing\ncountries.\nIt is proper to acknowledge the critical role of the financial\nresources in the application of science and technology to the development and strengthening of internal capability. Because of the shortage\nof financial resources of developing countries, the application of\nresources to science and technology is usually far below the allocations\nin developed countries. A margin of flexibility of many developing\ncountries is to severely restricted by the shortage of resources to\n*Numbers in the margin indicate pagination in the foreign text.\n1\n\ngive priority to space research.\nThe developed countries have accomplished nearly 95 percent of L\nall the activities of research and development whereas the developing\ncountries representing 70 percent of the world population only\nrepresent 5 percent. Theses figures show the magnitude of the problem\nand the task to be faced.\nThe resources and technological potential required to eliminate\nthe underdevelopment of the developing countries and to increase the\nworth of all mankind exists. The achievement of this objective requires\non one hand for the developing countries to exercise total control of\ntheir own resources and on the other hand the equitable distributic:n\nand creation of scientific and technological capabilities in the world.\nThe developing countries have recognized a long time ago the need\nfor following policies aimed at establishing on a national level the\nnecessary structures allowing them to increase to the maximum their\ncapability for development, absorption and use of science and technology, and to distribute the results of these important tools of\ndevelopment to all the areas of their population.\nThe international and regional cooperation for the development in\nthe area of science and technology should help the developing countries\nto strengthen their capacity for creation and innovation and stimulate\nat the same time their autonomous scientific and technological development. It requires the introduction of changes in the present modalities\nof international relations in this sector so as to increase substantially\ninternational cooperation and dius enhance the scientific and technological capacities in accordance with the needs of each country and in\naccordance with its real situation and its prospects for the future as\nwell as changes in the international process of transfer of technology\nso that these transfers should increase and be made much easier. In\nparticular for the developing countries especially in the case of a\ntechnology as advanced as in the space sector.\nWe will now attempt to define the problem as to how the developing\n2\n\ncountries can take part and achieve optimum use of the benefits of\nspace technology referring in particular to the area of remote observation, the particular topic of this meeting. In this connection we\nconsider what are the characteristics of the space technology being\nanalysed for the purpose of knowing what are the capacities which the\ndeveloping -ountries must acquire to be able to make use of it.\nIn this area we will say that remote observation has a capacity\nof overall monitoring which in order that it should provide a maximum\nbenefit for solving the problems of use and management of natural\nresources while the data acquired should be accessible for use by all\nthe countries.\nThat is why it is proper that those that produce these technologies\nshould consider the needs of the developing countries, adopting the\nmeasures which assure that the space systems established by them should\nsatisfy the needs of these countries.\nA problem which affects in general the developing countries is not\nso much the access to the data obtained by the satellites for the\nnatural resources, but the limited capacity which they have to use the\nlatter so that it would be proper to have a political and social aim of\nestablishing programs for when to use these data.\nThat is why there must be a clear understanding of what must be\nachieved with this data and the availability of adequate equipment and\npersonnel.\nRemote observation using satellites started in developed countries\nwhose natural resources are generally well known and developed, and\ntheir management is carried out on the basis of data and very good\ninformation with continuously improved technology, methodology, education\nand training, so that these areas which are the best known have in their /4 3\nturn the best equipped and trained investigators.\nt\n\nThe contrary usually occurs in the developing countries in which\nthe natural resources are known partly and lacking in data and reliable\nand updated information. While the infrastructure and personnel trained\n3\n\n1\n3\nto resolve the situation are generally inadequate.\nIt is undoubtedly true that remote observation is of high potential\nvalue to remedy the situation but for this to be achieved it is necessary to overcome limitations such as the absence of capable scientists,\nthe lack of equipment and technical support, the resistance of existing\nstructures to changing of the present methods and to work in a coordinated\nmanner, the adequate knowledge of the possibilities of remote observation,\nthe weakness of the decision making structure, etc.\nOne should therefore wonder whether the developing countries are\nfaced with an irreversible situation and the answer is no, provided\nthat the greater effort be made for the training of the human resources\nthan the acquisition of equipment.\nThe situation is such because it is through this trained professional who will be able to put forward programs whose benefits to the\ncountry justify the investment in equipment, defining exactly what\nequipment are needed and avoiding purchases without effective application and using and maintaining it adequately, showing the advantages of\nthe new technology and achieving the combination of efforts to accomplish important work.\nWhen we speak of training human resources we do not refer exclusively to scientists or technicians but also to the persons in charge\nwho have to take the decision. We must keep in mind that tre generalized\nacceptance of a new technology requires years for all the action aimed at\nfamiliarizing, educating and training should be manifested in a reduction\nof time.\nIt may seem that we are al; ready late in the achievement of this\ntraining action, in view of the rate of evolution of this technology,\nbut we must not forget that the systems now in use are of experimental\nnature so that we have the time to tackle successfully the operational\nphase, rendering our structures adequate to make full use of the possibilities.\n4\n\nI\n\n1\n\nAlthough this need for having qualified men and women has b\nwell understood by developing countries, very often the actions\naccomplished have tended to face partial problems and not to ache...\nan overall solution starting sometimes non-coordinated educational\nprograms and aimed only at professional personnel of higher level\nwhile others offer a multitude of courses which cause disorientation\nto anyone who has to offer one of them.\nAnother aspect to be considered is the number of professional\npeople who must be trained so that it must be kept in mind that very\noften projects are attempted in which there are mi; cute evaluations of\nphysical investments, disregarding or not studying with equal interest\nthe number of persons who will have to participate in them which leads\nto failure.\nIt is undoubtably true that the training of a large number of\npersons, sometimes in other more technologically advanced countries is\ncostly, but very often we do not use the multiplication effect in the\nfact that this specialized person can spread his knowledge by not\nplacing within his reach teaching material or demonstration equipment\nor not providing the time within a project for this activity to be\naccomplished.\nWe will now summarize this by saying that the training of human\nresources with the capacity to operate properly the elements which are\ninvolved in space technology is the main basis for the participation in\nthe benefits drawn for mankind, that this training should be accomplished\nat all levels starting from the one at which the political decisions are\nmade and ranging from scientists and professionals to the users; the /6 \t\ntraining method should be harmonious and continuous taking into account\nboth the quality and the number of persons to be trained and finally\nkeeping in mind the effort which is accomplished in this area will\nreduce the period for the space technology to be incorporated in the\ndevelopment of our countries.\nThe international organizations and their specialized agencies as\nwell as those who have and develop these technologies must play an\nimportant role in this area since it must be kept in mind that the dev5\n\nt\n\nelopment of countries is that of mankind.\nAlthough we have laid emphasis\nfail to refer to telecommunications\nsituation in this case is different\nmost developed space technology and\n\non remote observation we cannot\nsatellite systems, since the\ninasmuch as it is possibly the\nthat most widely used by countries.\n\nThis technology is now fully in its operational phase and we\nconsider that it was originated in the form in which it was born,\nseeing that it was initially designed for use on a world scale and the\nneed that it must satisfy is concrete. The contribution produced by\nhuman development is immense both at the social and economic level;\nwith regard to human interest, health, prevention of\nthe\ndisasters, education are indisputable.\n\ncontribution\n\nIt cannot be doubted that the widespread use of this technology in\nthe world has created problems in the frequencies and use of orbit, so\nthat the efforts which are put forward for coordination and cooperation,\nare important so that the benefits derived from satellite teleconmunication systems for mankind be accessible to all countries.\nOnce again we refer to the title of this paper referring to the\noptimal use by the developing countries of space technology to discuss\ntwo aspects apart from that of the training of human resources and which\nare concurrent.\nThe first is the one referring to technology transfer, a subject /7\nwhich is discussed very often in our countries since attention is\nfocussed on what may be received from the high technology centers\nwithout giving equal attention to the implementation of adequate\nmechanisms so that internally within the country itself there should be\na process of circulation thus creating groups with high knowledge, closed\nin themselves and dedicated to investigations without any beneficiaries.\nIt is extremely important to consider this aspect of having the\nmaximum possible participation of the potential users in all the areas\nof investigation and application which they will finally use.\n6\n\nThe intervention of users creates understanding and desire to use\nwhat they have contributed to create thus facilitating the incorporation\nof a new technology.\nThe second aspect refers to what we could call "technological\nstimulation" or "technological magnetism". Day by day technology puts\non the market new equipments and systems, anyone training in countries\nof high technology is acquainted with new instruments. It causes a\npermanent need for acquiring elements and is transformed into a\ncareer to maintain "a style" impossible to sustain. To prevent this\none should plan adequately the investment of the resources (normally\nscarce) in programs with well defined objectives and achieve an\nexhaustive use of the abilities of these "old" systems which are two\nor three years behind.\nWe must keep ii, mind what was mentioned previously with regard to\nthe present experimental nature of the technology of remote observation\nby satellite. If we consider the next 10 years we see a complex of\nnew satellites, each of them with advantages and limitations as compared with the others, which indicates to us that a certain time will /8\nelapse before the system is stabilized, a period which the developing\ncountries should use to obtain the ability to apply the maximum possibilities of space technology.\nNow we refer to the role which the developing countries should\nassume in the evolution of space technology, since we have to accept\npractically so far that we have been passive observers or at most\nconsumers of this technology but never or hardly ever active participants in its development.\nTo remedy this situation it is proper to have a clear idea of what\nwe want, what are our mistakes, so that we can take part in the definition and specification of projects in order that the latter should\nsatisfy our needs and not what we consider necessary to use a technology.\nAs we mentioned previously this requires trained professional people\nwho can formulate concrete technical definitions so that they can become\n7\n\nvalid representatives to speak to those who now possess the technology.\nIt is undoubtedly true that space technology is very costly and\nit is practically impossible to claim. to progress individually in\nthis field. That is why mutual collaboration arises as the basic\nelement which will allow our countries to take part jointly with the\ndeveloped countries in space experiments and research.\nWe see daily this collaboration between developed countries\ninasmuch as even they cannot afford the immense investments which must\nbe allotted. That is why we do not accept the position of those who\nconsider that the countries possessing the technology represent a\nclosed club to which we cannot have access since it is undoubtedly\ntrue that the developing countries must create the proper structures\nto take part in space technology programs.\nThis participation may assume different forms among which we can\nmention those which were described in the previous document 101/BP /8\nof the United Nations:\na) "Participation in basic space research through analysis and\ninterpretation of data of scientific research satellites"\nb) "Participation in the design and manufacture of satellites\nand ground receiving stations"\nc) "Research and development of new applications of telecommunication satellites or data of meteorological or remote observation satellites".\nWe consider that these are only some of the many paths which the\ndeveloping countries can and should take to participate in the advances\nand applications of space technology is an active form and with the\ndynamism which the latter requires; it is a challenge which we must\naccept with the conviction of victory.\n\n/9\n\n'
