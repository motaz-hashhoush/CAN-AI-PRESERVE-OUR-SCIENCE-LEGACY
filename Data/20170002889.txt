The ball nut is adapted to receive an input torque and\nin response rotates and supplies a drive force. The ball screw\nextends through the ball nut and has a first end and a second\nend. The ball screw receives the drive force from the ball nut\nand in response selectively translates between a retract\nposition and a extend position. The ball screw stop is\nmounted on the ball screw proximate the first end to translate\ntherewith. The ball screw stop engages the ball nut when the\nball screw is in the extend position, translates, with compliance, a predetermined distance toward the first end upon\nengaging the ball nut, and prevents further rotation of the\nball screw upon translating the predetermined distance.\n8 Claims, 13 Drawing Sheets\n\nSTART\n1702\n\nM11ASURE WOTOR CURRENT WHILE\nSTOP ME1`a:EER ENuAaED\n\n11:704\n\nL)ETERM NE REL.AT (~NSNIP PETV-,\n\'EEN_r 1 70\nMOTOR CURRENT AND REAL rION FORCE\n\nEN}\n\nUS 9,587,725 B2\nPage 2\n(56)\n\nReferences Cited\nU.S. PATENT DOCUMENTS\n\n4,479,397\n4,712,440\n5,456,330\n5,868,032\n6,761,080\n7,728,477\n7,896,147\n8,109,165\n8,360,397\n8,424,402\n2002/0074866\n2002/0149268\n2003/0037629\n2010/0319472\n2011/0072921\n2011/0303032\n2012/0090418\n\nA\n10/1984 Jelinek et al.\nA\n12/1987 Rousselot\nA\n10/1995 Kojima et al.\nA\n2/1999 Laskey\nB2\n7/2004 Lange et al.\nB2\n6/2010 Birdi et al.\nB2\n3/2011 Burke et al.\nB2\n2/2012 Himmelmann\nB2\n1/2013 Watanabe\nB2\n4/2013 Watanabe et al.\nAl* 6/2002 Morishima .........

The ball nut outer surface\n212 has an input gear 222 coupled thereto and extending\ntherefrom. The input gear 222 receives, via the non-illustrated gear set, the rotational drive torque supplied from one\nor both of the motors 102, which in turn causes the ball nut\n104 to rotate and supply the drive force to the ball screw 106.\nThe ball screw 106 is mounted within the housing assembly 112 and extends through the ball nut passageway 216.\nThe ball screw 106 is configured, upon receipt of the drive\nforce supplied thereto from the ball nut 104, to selectively\ntranslate between a retract position and a extend position. As\nillustrated most clearly in FIGS. 3-5, the ball screw 106\nincludes a first end 302, a second end 304, and an outer\nsurface 306. The ball screw outer surface 306 has a single or\na plurality of ball grooves (or "threads") 308 formed\nthereon. A plurality of non-illustrated recirculating balls are\ndisposed within the ball nut ball grooves 218, and in selected\nones of the ball screw ball grooves 308. The balls, in\ncombination with the ball grooves 218, 308, convert the\nrotational movement ofthe ball nut 104 into the translational\nmovement of the ball screw 106. It will be appreciated that\nthe direction in which the ball screw 106 travels will depend\non the direction in which the ball nut 104 rotates.\nAs FIGS. 6-8 further depict, a ball screw stop 120 is\nmounted on the ball screw 106 in a manner that causes the\nball screw stop 120 to translate with ball screw 106. The ball\nscrew stop 120 may be variously implemented, but is\nconfigured to engage the ball nut 104 when the ball screw\n106 is in the extend position. The ball screw stop 120 is\nadditionally configured such that, upon engaging the ball nut\n104, a portion thereof translates, with compliance, a predetermined distance toward the first end 302 of the ball screw\n106 and, upon translating the predetermined distance, to\nprevent further rotation of the ball nut 104 in one direction,\nwhile allowing rotation thereof in an opposite direction. It\nwill be appreciated that the ball screw stop 120 may be\nvariously configured to implement this functionality. One\nparticular embodiment ofthe ball screw stop 120 is depicted\nmore clearly in FIGS. 9-12, and with reference thereto will\nnow be described.\nThe depicted ball screw stop 120 includes a guide member 902, a stop member 904, and a spring member 906. The\nguide member 902 is mounted directly on, and surrounds,\nthe first end 302 of the ball screw 106. As shown even more\nclearly in FIGS.8 and 13, the guide member 902 is mounted\non the ball screw 106 via a fastener 1302 that extends\nthrough the guide member 902 and the ball screw 106, and\nis held in place via a nut 1304.\nThe stop member 904 is coupled to the guide member 902\nvia the spring member 906, and also surrounds the ball\nscrew 106. The stop member 902 includes a first end 908\n(see FIG. 9), a second end 912, an inner surface 914, and an\nouter surface 916. The first end 908 is coupled to the spring\nmember 906, and the second end 912 has a second dog stop\n918 formed thereon. The second dog stop 918 is configured\nto mate with the first dog stop 214 that is formed on the ball\nnut 104 when the ball screw stop 120 engages the ball nut\n104. The inner surface 914 defines an opening through\nwhich the ball screw 106 extends. The inner surface 914 also\nhas a rotation limit feature 920 formed therein. In particular,\na portion of the inner surface 914 has an increased diameter\nrelative to the remainder thereof, and thereby forms two\nengagement surfaces-a first engagement surface 922 and a\nsecond engagement surface 924. The purpose ofthe engagement surfaces 922, 924 will be described momentarily.\nThe spring member 906 is coupled between the guide\nmember 902 and the stop member 904, and is what causes\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n10\n\nThe following detailed description is merely exemplary in\nnature and is not intended to limit the invention or the\napplication and uses of the invention. As used herein, the\nword "exemplary" means "serving as an example, instance,\nor illustration." Thus, any embodiment described herein as\n"exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred\nor advantageous over other embodiments.All ofthe embodiments described herein are exemplary embodiments provided to enable persons skilled in the art to make or use the\ninvention and not to limit the scope of the invention which\nis defined by the claims. Furthermore, there is no intention\nto be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in\nthe preceding technical field, background, brief summary, or\nthe following detailed description.\nReferring to FIGS. 1 and 2, an exemplary ball screw\nactuator 100 is depicted. The depicted actuator 100 is a\nlinear electromechanical(EMA)actuator and includes a pair\nof motors 102 (102-1, 102-2), a ball nut 104, and a ball\nscrew 106, all disposed at least partially within or on an\nactuator housing assembly 112. The motors 102, which are\nmounted on the housing assembly 112, may be variously\nconfigured and implemented. For example, each motor 102\nmay be implemented using any one of numerous types of\nhydraulic motors, pneumatic motors, or electric motors. In\nthe depicted embodiment, each is implemented using an\nelectric motor, which may be any one of numerous types of\nelectric motors, such as an AC motor, a brushed DC motor,\nor a brushless DC motor,just to name a few. No matter how\nthe motors 102 are specifically implemented, each is\ncoupled to the ball nut 104, preferably via a non-illustrated\ngear set, and each is configured to selectively supply a drive\ntorque to the ball nut 104. Although two redundant motors\n102 are depicted in FIG. 1, it will be appreciated that the\nactuator 100 could be implemented with more or less than\nthis number of motors.\nBefore proceeding further, it is noted that the depicted\nactuator 100 additionally includes a pair of position sensors\n103 (103-1, 103-2). The position sensors 103, like the\nmotors 102, are mounted on the housing assembly 112 and\nmay be variously configured and implemented. In the\ndepicted embodiment, however, the position sensors 103 are\neach implemented using a resolver configured to provide an\noutput signal representative of actuator position.\nThe ball nut 104, which is shown more clearly in FIG. 2,\nis rotationally mounted in the housing assembly 112, via a\nplurality of bearing assemblies 202(202-1, 202-2). The ball\nnut 104 is coupled to receive the input torque supplied from\none or both ofthe motors 102 and is configured, upon receipt\nthereof, to rotate and supply a drive force to the ball screw\n106. The ball nut 104 may be variously configured and\nimplemented, but includes at least a first end 204, a second\nend 206, an inner surface 208, and an outer surface 212. The\nball nut first end 204 has a first dog stop 214 formed thereon,\nthe purpose of which will be described further below. The\nball nut inner surface 208 defines a passageway 216 that\nextends through the ball nut 104 between the first and second\nends 204, 206, and has a plurality of helical ball grooves (or\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nUS 9,587,725 B2\n5\n\n6\n\nthe ball screw stop 120, and more specifically the stop\nFurthermore, depending on the context, words such as\n"connect" or "coupled to" used in describing a relationship\nmember 904, to translate with compliance.
