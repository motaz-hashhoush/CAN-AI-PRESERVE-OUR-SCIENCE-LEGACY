DC coupling\nis used to preserve the original DC offset.\nHow it's done:\nThe circuit is shown in the diagram; the output of\nthe first of three general-purpose operational amplifiers is bridged to its input by a double-anode zener\nor two closely-matched back-to-back zeners (CR1)\nwith breakdown voltages within the excursion capability of the amplifier (say, 8 volts). The amplification\nof the second amplifier (an inverter) is set approximately at unity by resistors of the order of 10 kilohxns\n(\xc2\xb1 5%). The input resistor to the last amplifier is set\n\nOutput\n\nat a few kilohms to 100 kilohms or more, and the\nintegrating capacitor can be from 100 pf or less to 1\nmfd or more in order to set the slope limit. For ad:\njustable slope operation, the input resistor to the last\nstage may be variable and the capacitor value is\naltered by switching. The output resistor in the last\nstage is optional but, if used, it determines the circuit\noutput impedance, and permits use of large capacitances which otherwise must be limited to about 0.05\nmfd by the choice of the operational amplifier. The\nmain feedback resistor, R6, and the input resistor, R1,\ndetermine the overall gain of the circuit; generally,\nthey will be 'a closely-matched pair (say, 10 kilohms\neach). The series resistor-capacitor combination, R7\nand C2, across R6 compensates the loop gain which,\nfor a small signal, is the product of the gains of the\nfirst and third amplifiers (typically about 200 dB); the\nRC combination also stabilizes the gain. The optimum\nvalue of the RC combination is determined empirically, and will be governed by the characteristics of\nthe operational amplifiers, but if the integrating capacitor, Ci, is switched, then the RC compensating\ncombination must also be switched.\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

A constant voltage is applied to\nthe inverter, causing the integrator to slew at a uniform rate until the output very nearly equals the\ninput.\nWhen the change of input signal is sufficiently slow\nto allow the integrator to keep up with it, the circuit\noperates linearly, exactly reproducing the input waveform. (Note that the output signal is inverted in polarity with respect to the input).\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed\nto:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nNASA Pasadena Office\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, California 91103\nReference: TSP .73-10348\nPatent status:\nNASA has decided not to apply for a patent.\nSource: Alexander Engel of\r\nCaltech/JPL\r\nunder contract to\r\nNASA Pasadena Office\r\n(NPO-11773)\n\n.\n\n[IJ\nB73-10346\t\n\nCategory 01\n\n"
