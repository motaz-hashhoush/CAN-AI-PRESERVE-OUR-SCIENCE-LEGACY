b'Edison Demonstration of Smallsat Networks\nA Swarm of Advanced Nanosatellites that Enables Cross-Link\nCommunication and Multipoint Scientific Measurements\nThe goal of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Edison\nDemonstration of Smallsat Networks\n(EDSN) mission is to demonstrate\ninteractive satellite swarms capable of\ncollecting, exchanging and transmitting\nmulti-point scientific measurements.\nSatellite swarms enable a wide array\nof scientific, commercial and academic\nresearch not achievable with a single\nsatellite. The EDSN satellites are\nscheduled to be launched into space as\nsecondary payloads on the first flight of\nthe Super Strypi launch vehicle no earlier\nthan Oct. 29, 2015.\nEDSN consists of a group of eight\nsatellites in a loose cluster arrangement\nthat will be deployed approximately\n310 miles (500 kilometers) above Earth.\nEach EDSN satellite is a 1.5-unit (1.5U)\nCubeSat measuring about 4 inches x\n4 inches x 6.5 inches (10 centimeters\nx 10 centimeters x 16 centimeters)\nand weighing approximately 4.5\npounds (2 kilograms). EDSN satellites\nwere developed to leverage recent\nadvancements in small spacecraft and\ncommercial off-the-shelf hardware\nand software to reduce cost and\ndevelopment time. The EDSN satellites\nemploy a commercial smartphone\nprocessor first tested on a series of\nNASA Phonesat missions in 201314. EDSN uses the same Android\nsmartphone technology to perform\nmany of the spacecraft functions\nnormally accomplished with expensive,\ncustomized electronics components. The\nsatellites use time and orbital knowledge\nprovided by GPS data to autonomously\nplan activities including recording sensor\ndata, exchanging inter-satellite data and\ndownlinking data to a ground station.\n\nEDSN Swarm with Highlighted Satellite\nData Exchange Methods\nAboard each satellite is a sensor that\nmeasures the intensity of energetic\ncharged particles in the surrounding\nspace environment. The measurements\nfrom the whole swarm can be combined\nto characterize the radiation environment\nacross a broad volume of space. Data\nis exchanged among the swarm using\na hub-and-spoke network. Every 25\nhours, the hub is switched to another\nsatellite in the swarm, enabling the\nmission to continue in the event that any\nindividual satellite experiences an upset\nor exceeds communication range.\nThe EDSN swarm has a planned mission\nduration of 60 days during which the\ninter-satellite distances will vary from a\nfew miles to several hundred miles. The\nsatellites will continue recording science\ndata and downlinking to the ground\nstation even after they exceed intersatellite communication range.\nThe launch of tens (or someday\nhundreds) of interacting satellites\nwould enable an unprecedented\namount of sensors, communications\nand computing capability in low-Earth\norbit. Swarm technologies have the\n\npotential to provide flexible data correlation and\ndistribution, system redundancy, simplification of\nsatellite operations and the enabling of new multisatellite science investigations through distributed\narchitectures, sensor webs and disaggregated\nsystems. These architectures can provide\nenhanced scientific data collection for industry,\nuniversity researchers and NASA scientists.\nThe EDSN project is based at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Ames\nResearch Center at Moffett Field, California. EDSN\nproject partners include NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Marshall Space\nFlight Center in Huntsville, Alabama; Montana\nState University; and Santa Clara University.\nThe EDSN project is funded by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Small\nSpacecraft Technology Program (SSTP), which\nis chartered to develop and mature technologies\nto enhance and expand the capabilities of\nsmall spacecraft with a particular focus on\ncommunications, propulsion, pointing, power,\nand autonomous operations. SSTP is one of\nnine programs within NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Technology\nMission Directorate.\n\nFor more information about the SSTP, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/smallsats\nFor more information about EDSN, please\ncontact:\nDeborah Westley\nEDSN Project Manager\nNASA Ames Research Center\nDeborah.M.Westley@nasa.gov\nAndres Martinez\nSmall Spacecraft Technology Program Manager\nSpace Technology Mission Directorate\nNASA Ames Research Center\nAndres.Martinez@nasa.gov\nAndrew Petro\nSmall Spacecraft Technology Program Executive\nSpace Technology Mission Directorate\nNASA Headquarters\nAndrew.J.Petro@nasa.gov\n\nCompleted EDSN Flight Units with Engineers Inspecting EDSN Flight Spares\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nAmes Research Center\nMoffett Field, CA 94035\n\nFS-#2015-03-01-ARC\n\n'
