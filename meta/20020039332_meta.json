Included are: a miniaturized and low power X-band transponder, a constellation communication and navigation transceiver, a cold gas micro-thruster, two different variable emittance (thermal) controllers, flex cables for solar array power collection, autonomous groundbased constellation management tools, and a new CMOS ultra low-power, radiation-tolerant, +0.5 volt logic technology. The ST-5 focus is on small and low-power. A single-processor, multi-function flight computer will implement direct digital and analog interfaces to all of the other spacecraft subsystems and components. There will not be a distributed data system that uses a standardized serial bus such as MIL-STD-1553 or MIL-STD-1773. The flight software running on the single processor will be responsible for all real-time processing associated with: guidance, navigation and control, command and data handling (C&DH) including uplink/downlink, power switching and battery charge management, science data analysis and storage, intra-constellation communications, and housekeeping data collection and logging. As a nanosatellite trail-blazer for future constellations of up to 100 separate space vehicles, ST-5 will demonstrate a compact (single board), low power (5.5 watts) solution to the data acquisition, control, communications, processing and storage requirements that have traditionally required an entire network of separate circuit boards and/or avionics boxes. In addition to the New Millennium technologies, other major spacecraft subsystems include the power system electronics, a lithium-ion battery, triple-junction solar cell arrays, a science-grade magnetometer, a miniature spinning sun sensor, and a propulsion system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20020039332, "endDate": "2002-03-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "1c5cb570b2ad42a0b411d9dcfc6146d1", "id": "f1e7f2ce6c4e439fb12851aae37cccbc"}], "name": "2002 IEEE Aerospace Conference", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "1c5cb570b2ad42a0b411d9dcfc6146d1", "startDate": "2002-03-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020039332, "isbn": "0-7803-7231-X", "id": "35f8be2a4392407a974df63847b40749", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020039332.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020039332/downloads/20020039332.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020039332/downloads/20020039332.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020039332/downloads/20020039332.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
