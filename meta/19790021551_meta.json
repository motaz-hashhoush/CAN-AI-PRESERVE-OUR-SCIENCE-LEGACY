These needs included measurement sensitivities for polar environmental data (ice/snow, atmosphere, and ocean data for integrated support) and the processing and delivery requirements which determine the effectiveness of environmental services. An assessment was made of how well electromagnetic signals can be converted into polar environmental information. The array of sensor developments in process or proposed were also evaluated as to the spectral diversity, aperture sizes, and swathing capabilities available to provide these measurements from spacecraft, aircraft, or in situ platforms. Global coverage and local coverage densification options were studied in terms of alternative spacecraft trajectories and aircraft flight paths.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790021551, "id": "627ef73ad1ac4e6cad1c9e92ddfa86a2", "publicationDate": "1979-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790021551.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790021551/downloads/19790021551.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790021551/downloads/19790021551.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790021551/downloads/19790021551.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
