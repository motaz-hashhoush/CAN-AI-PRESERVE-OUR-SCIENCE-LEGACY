If only slight amounts of water\nmove out of leaf cells due to the development of water deficit\nstress (WDS), turgor pressure typically decreases substantially in response.\n5 If an unusual decrease of turgor pressure in leaf cells could\nbe detected non-invasively and in real-time, such a detection\ncould potentially signal the onset of leaf dehydration and\nhence the development of WDS in plants.\nTraditionally, turgor pressure of cells has been determined\nio by either one of two ways. Turgor pressure of cells has been\nmeasured by some studies directly by actually inserting\nmicrocapillary tubes into the cells under test and measuring\nthe pressure inside the cells directly using pressure transducers or micromanometers. Clearly, such an approach is\n15 destructive, time-consuming, rather cumbersome to conduct,\nand mainly of academic interest. The method mostly used in\npractical applications determines the turgor pressure of leaf\ncells indirectly by determining the overall water potential\n(Xw) and the solute water potential (X S) of a leaf under test by\n20 appropriate means. Since the overall water potential of leaf\ncells equals the sum of the solute water potential and the\npressure water potential (XP; which is the turgor pressure) of\nleaf cells:\n\nAttending to the watering needs of plants has been an issue\nfor mankind ever since the cultivation of plants began many\nthousands of years ago.

In fact, several studies have\ncies, or the interaction with a bio-control for organic disease\nshown that a loss of the relative water content (RWC) of leaf\ncontrol including, cell movement, signal transduction, intercells of just 15% from their nominal high RWC-values may\nnal chemical processes and external environmental processes\ncause the turgor pressure of these leaf cells to decline sub- 65 including when plants require watering, and methods of\nstantially, or to be completely lost. Thus, turgor pressure of\nattending to the watering of plants including signaling the\nleaf cells is one of the most sensitive parameters to detect the\ngrower that the plants are in need of hydration.\n\nUS 7,660,698 B1\n3\n\n4\n\nOne novel method of the present invention includes determining the hydration needs of a plant by non-destructively\nmeasuring of phytometric physiological flux, cell movement,\nsignal transduction, internal chemical processes and external\nenvironmental processes including the thickness of the plant\nleaves in vivo.\nAnother novel method of the present invention includes\nmeasuring the infrared light reflected from the plant leaves as\na means for real-time phytometric assessing leaf water content.\nA third method of the present invention includes real-time\ndetecting plant water deficit stress by phytometric measuring\nthe infrared light transmitted through the plant leaves as a\nmeans for assessing leaf water content and detecting plant\nwater deficit stress.\nThe final method of the present invention describes a realtime phytometric method for measuring the turgor pressure of\nplant leaf cells non-destructively, in real time and in vivo.\nAll of these methods lend themselves to forming an effective plant-human interface including intelligent plant sensing\nand the use of internet based sensors.\nThe real-time phytometric invention can be extremely miniaturized. Since sensors can be manufactured very lightweight, they may be clipped onto leaves for long periods of\ntime without disturbing the plants normal function. Data and\npower may be transmitted to and from these sensors wirelessly, utilizing one or several wireless data- and power-transmission technologies existing today, which are expected to be\nfurther developed and miniaturized in the near future, such as\nZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4), WiFi, Bluetooth, Sensor-MeshNetworks, and RFID.\nThis real-time phytometric invention provides means to\nmeasure water deficit stress in plants by using one or several\nof the described actual sensing methods. It also includes\nmeans to translate measured parameters into human language\nand to communicate with a user or operator in an intelligent\nway, thus fulfilling all the definitions of a smart or intelligent\nsensor.\nFor example, a base station could translate measurement\nparameters into voice-messages. In particular, if a device has\ndetermined that water stress is developing in a plant being\nmeasured, the device could articulate such an alarm-situation\nnot only via lights, light-emitting-diodes, displays, buzzers,\nor the like, but also with an appropriate voice message.\nThe real-time phytometric invention could further be connected to the Internet and transmit messages and data over\nlong distances, providing users and operators access to the\nintelligent leaf water stress sensors remotely and at any time.\nFor example, the data of one or several leaf sensors could be\nmade available on an Internet web site. This way a user/\noperator had access to this data worldwide wherever he/she\nfinds access to the Internet with a computer, PDA, or cell\nphone. If an alarm-situation arises, i.e. if water deficit stress\ndevelops in the plants being measured, a base station could\nsend out an email-alert, a cell phone text message, a pager\nmessage, or a cell phone voice message, thus reaching a\nuser/operator virtually at any time. An alerted user/operator\ncould then use any means of modern communication, such as\nInternet based remote communication via computer, PDA,\ncell phone text messaging, or cell phone voice messages, to\nreact appropriately, for example by remotely initializing plant\nwatering. Of course, a base station could also be used to\ninitiate plant irrigation automatically based on the signals of\nleaf water stress sensors, and only alert the user/operator via\nthe Internet or a cell phone without the need for an actual\nfeedback from the user/operator.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFIG.1 is a schematic drawing showing the elements of the\nplant leaf thickness sensor.\n5 FIG. 2 is a schematic drawing showing the elements of the\nReflectance in the Infrared Based Leaf Water Index, denoted\n"RIRWI-Sensor."\nFIG. 3 is a schematic drawing showing the elements of the\nTransmittance in the Infrared Based Leaf Water Index,\n10 denoted the "TIRWI Sensor."\nFIG. 4 is a graph showing the shift in wavelength of light\ndue to the change of turgor pressure in purple bacteria Rhodospirillum rubrum.\nThe following table of elements is provided to assist in the\n15 recognition of drawing elements taken in conjunction with\nthe accompanying drawings.\n\n20\n22\n24\n26\n30\n32\n34\n36\n38\n40\n50\n52\n54\n56\n59\n60\n\n20\t\n\n25\t\n\n30\t\n\n35\n\nHall Effect Sensor Integrated Circuit\nmagnet\nGripper like fixture\nLeaf\nHousing\n1450 nm LED\n1300 nm LED\nIR Photodiode Sensing Element\nAperture\nBlack Absorbing Background Material\nUpper Housing\n1450 nm LED\n1300 nm LED\nLower Housing\nIR Photodiode Sensing Element\nAperture\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe following definitions are provided to clarify the invention:\nPhysiological Bio-Feedback\nThe plant physiological biofeedback associated with the\nmeasurement of intrinsic physical or behavioral traits within\nthe plant as described in this invention. These traits are measured in real-time. The bio-feedback signal is measured in a\n45 unit yet to be determined, at this point termed "plant-stress".\nThe bio-feedback analog or digital signal is stored in the\nRAM of a computer chip. The plant is said to reach the unit\n"plant-stress" when the data spikes. For example, it has been\nshown that the TIR leaf water index as described in this\n50 invention exhibits a characteristic increase between several\nhours and several days before leaves actually start to dehydrate during the development of water deficit stress. It is our\nbelieve that this phenomenon is a direct result of the relocation of chloroplasts within cells due to the down-regulation of\n55 photosynthetic activity. Thus, the described characteristic\nincrease of the TIR leaf water index may be used to detect the\ndown-regulation of photosynthetic activity easily, non-destructively, and in real-time. Detecting the down-regulation\nof plant-photo synthetic activity easily, non-destructively, and\n60 in real-time, provides an advantageous bio-feedback signal\nfor plant cultivation since at the point in time where photosynthesis is down-regulated due to the influence of stressful\nenvironmental conditions, such as water deficit stress, no sign\nof stress or desiccation is typically visible to visual inspection\n65 of a plant by the unaided eye. Such bio-feedback signals are\ntherefore far more advantageous compared to plain visual\ninspections of plants in terms of detecting detrimental envi40\n\nUS 7,660,698 B1\n5\n\n6\n\nronmental conditions early, or actually in real-time. The biofeedback methods described in this invention also have an\neconomic advantage compared to currently available typical\nmeasurement equipment for the assessment of plant photosynthetic activity based on carbon-dioxide flux, stomatal conductance, or leaf temperature. Such measurement equipment,\ntypically termed "photosynthesis suites", are usually rather\nexpensive, and have so far gained market potential in academic applications mainly. In contrast, the bio-feedback\nmethods described in this invention have the potential to be\nmanufactured rather inexpensive and can be operated fully\nautomatically over longer periods of time under actual field\nconditions, such as in farming or greenhouse applications.\n\ndirect is absorbed by the cell and assimilated into the plant.\nThe invention comprises a phytometric device capable of\nmeasuring internal chemical processes including Ca ion,\nnitrogen, phosphate, potassium, iron, sulfur and other trace\nelements.\n\n5\n\nExternal Environmental Processes\nThe measurement of physiological flux with a phytometric\ndevice for measuring wind and drought conditions are\nexamples of external environmental processes as they relate\n10\ndirectly to the cells of the plant. Another example of an\nexternal environmental process is the phototrophic response\nof a plant bending towards a light source placed near the side\nof the plant. The plant bends because more light is on one side\nof the plant. The bending is due to an increase of photosyn15 thetic process within the plant cells. In such case the plant\nappears to bend away for the dark.\nThe invention comprises a phytometric device which measures pathogen and insect pressures within the local environ20 ment, such as a field. The real-time measure of external environmental processes would provide a phytometric\nbiofeedback signal of plant pathogen response such as the\ndying back of cells where pathogen infection occurs.\n\nPhysiological Flux\nThe Apogee Instruments BQM (basic quantum meter)\nmanufactured by Apogee Instruments Logan, Utah, measures\nthe photosynthetic photon flux of a light source. The BQM\nmeasures and calculates the amount of energy in the light\nsource necessary for plant photosynthesis. NASA has determined the level of photon flux for a number of vegetables and\nfruiting plants (Stoner, NAS10-98030).\nPhoton flux of either sunlight or electrical is measured in\nunits of \xc2\xb5mol\xe2\x80\xa2rri \'\xe2\x80\xa2s\').

An example is\nfrom or transmitted through leaves are not only a function of\nthe Ca ion exchange that takes place when a bio-control 65 the RWC of leaf cells. The overall thickness of leaves influcontaining elicitor described by Stoner and Linden (2006) are\nences such ratios as well. The reason for this dependency is\nin direct contact with the plant cell wall. The ion exchange\nthat leaf water content ratios based on light reflected from or\n\nUS 7,660,698 B1\n7\ntransmitted through leaves are primarily a function of the\nabsolute amount of water perceived by the light reflected\nfrom or transmitted through leaves, which may be approximated by the so-called equivalent water thickness (EWT) of\nleaves. This absolute amount of water, however, depends on 5\ntwo factors: the overall developed thickness of leaves and the\nRWC of leaf cells. Thus, in order to estimate the RWC of leaf\ncells using light reflected from or transmitted through leaves,\nthe overall thickness of theses leaves has to be taken into\naccount in order to convert such leaf water content ratios 10\nbased on reflectance or transmittance qualitatively correct to\nthe RWC of leaf cells, which creates the need to measure the\noverall thickness of leaves conveniently, with high resolution,\nnon destructively, and in real-time.\nThe results of recent studies investigating the dynamics of 15\nleaf parameters during the development of water deficit stress\nin plants have pointed to another application calling for the\nneed to measure the overall thickness of leaves conveniently,\nwith high resolution, non-destructively, and in real time. The\nresults of these studies indicate that the overall thickness of 20\nleaves may be used to indirectly detect the loss of turgor\npressure of leaf cells, hence the onset of leaf dehydration. The\nturgor pressure of leaf cells is one of the most sensitive parameters to detect the onset of leaf dehydration. Thus, if the\nsubstantial decrease of turgor pressure in leaf cells could be 25\ndetected non invasively and in real-time, such a detection\ncould potentially signal the onset of leaf dehydration and\nhence the development of WDS in plants.\nUnusual decline of the overall thickness of leaves may\nindicate the substantial reduction or loss of turgor pressure of 30\nleaf cells which in turn may signal the onset of leaf dehydration as it may happen during the development of WDS in\nplants. Hence, the detection of unusual declining leaf thicknesses maybe used for the detection of WDS in plants, which\ncalls for the need to measure the overall thickness of leaves 35\nconveniently, with high resolution, non destructively, and in\nreal-time, as realized by the developed LTMH leaf thickness\nsensor.\nPlease refer to FIG. 1. The apparatus of the present invention comprises a sensor system known as a LTMH sensor. The 40\ninstant system currently contains a Hall-effect sensor Integrated Circuit (IC) 20 with analog signal output (model\nMLX90215, Melexis Microelectronic Systems, Concord,\nN.H.) and a magnet 22 (model HE155, Hamlin Electronics,\nLake Mills, Wis.). The magnetic sensitivity of the used Hall- 45\neffect sensor IC MLX90215 was programmed to be 20\nmV/mT, the output voltage of this Hall-effect sensor IC 20\nwhen no magnetic flux is present (V,,,gB-0) was programmed to be 2.5 V, and the used magnet HE 155 exhibits a\nnominal magnetic flux density of 12.0 mT (120 Gauss). Both 50\nelements, the Hall-effects sensor IC 20 and the magnet 22, are\nmounted on a gripper like fixture, such as gripper arms 24, for\nexample, in such a way that they can touch a leaf 26 from\nopposite sides.\nThe Hall-effect sensor IC 20 measures magnetic flux den- 55\nsity and converts this measurement into a corresponding voltage, the so-called Hall-voltage. Since both elements are\nmounted on gripper like fixture 24, their positions with\nrespect to each other are fixed, except that the distance\nbetween the magnet 22 and the Hall-effect sensor IC 20 can 60\nbe varied by opening and closing movements of the arms of\nthe gripper like fixture 24. Thus, the magnetic flux density\nperceived by the Hall-effect sensor IC 20 depends on the\ndistance between the Hall-effect sensor IC 20 and the magnet\n22 only. Hence, when this gripper fixture 24 is clipped onto a 65\nleaf 26 and the arms of the fixture 24 are allowed to close, the\nfinal distance between the Hall-effect sensor IC 20 and the\n\n8\nmagnet 22 is given by the thickness of the leaf 26 under test,\nresulting in the Hall-voltage to be a function of the leaf\nthickness.\nThe gripper like fixture 24 not only provides the exact\npositioning of the Hall-effect sensor IC 20 and the magnet 22\nwith respect to each other, but also allows the convenient\noperation of this LTMH-sensor system when measuring the\nthickness of leaves as a clip-on-leaf type sensor. The closing\nforce of this fixture is currently provided by 1 inch thick\nOPENCELL-foam (model 30100, Future Foam, Inc., Denver,\nColo.) mounted between the arms of the gripper like fixture\n24 at the end opposite of the Hall-effect sensor IC 20 and the\nmagnet 22, so that this LTMH-sensor system can be closed on\na leaf 26 extremely gently, avoiding the problems of damaging leaf cells often associated with conventional mechanical\nmicrometers or calibers, although other means for providing\na gentle closing force could be applied as well.\nThe magnet 22 used is cylindrical in form with a diameter\nof about 3 mm. If the gripping fixture 24 is clipped onto a leaf\nso that the magnet 22 is positioned at the abaxial (lower) side\nof the leaf 26, the magnet 22, due to its small diameter,\ntypically fits between major leaf veins, thus allowing the\nmeasurement of the thickness of leaves at typical leaf cross\nsections without the misleading effect of major veins.\nWhen the gripper like fixture 24 is completely closed without any material present between the Hall-effect sensor IC 20\nand the magnet 22, i.e. if the Hall-effect sensor IC 20 and the\nmagnet 22 touch each other, the output voltage of the Hall\neffect sensor IC has been measured to be about 4.2 V. This\nparticular Hall-voltage shall be denoted "zero position Hall\nvoltage" for calibration purposes.\nIn order to calibrate the LTMH-sensor, a stack containing\n20 sheets of writing paper and 4 sheets of plastic foil was\ncreated. Each sheet of writing paper exhibited a sheet-thickness of about 100 \xc2\xb5m and each sheet of plastic foil exhibited\na sheet-thickness of about 25 \xc2\xb5m. This stack was used to\ncreate various calibration thicknesses by combination of various numbers of writing paper and plastic foil, which were\nmeasured with the developed LTMH-sensor and immediately\nverified using a mechanical micrometer (Micrometer No.\n616, Brown & Sharp Mfg. Co., Providence, R.I.). During the\ncalibration process a certain number of writing papers and\nplastic foils was placed between the arms of the LTMH sensor, the arms of the LTMH-sensor were allowed to close, the\noutput voltage of the LTMH-sensor was recorded, as well as\nthe corresponding control measurement of the created thickness of writing papers and plastic foils using the mechanical\nmicrometer, for each thickness investigated.\nThe relationship between the Hall-voltage difference to the\n"zero position Hall voltage" and applied distances, or thicknesses, appeared to be a polynomial function of second\ndegree, exhibiting a coefficient of determination (R 2) of\ngreater than 0.999. Thus, the principle described above\nappears to be an accurate and convenient way to measure the\nthickness of plant leaves. The calibration procedure described\nabove can be justified because the absolute magnetic permeability of water is close to the absolute magnetic permeability\nof air, or vacuum, which is why the relative permeability of\nwater is close to one. Thus, the difference between determining the thickness of plant leaves, the cells of which are mainly\ncomprised of water, and the thickness of sheets of writing\npaper and plastic foil, can be assumed to be negligible. In fact,\nwhen the LTMH-sensor was applied to real leaves, using the\ncalibration formula as obtained in the calibration process\ndescribed above, and these measurements were verified using\na mechanical micrometer, virtually no difference was found\n\n9\n\n\t\n\nUS 7,660,698 B1\n\nbetween the results in leaf thickness obtained using the\nLTMH-sensor, and using the mechanical micrometer.\nThe LTMH-sensor currently exhibits a resolution of about\n0.5 \xc2\xb5m and a repeatability of measurement results of smaller\nthan about 10 \xc2\xb5m. Updating the "zero position Hall voltage"\nmay decrease the repeatability below about 5 \xc2\xb5m. The developed LTMH-sensor is connected to appropriate electronics\n(stand-alone or in conjunction with a computer or a computer\nalone), which provides appropriated control, particularly\nreading of the output voltage of the Hall-effect sensor at\nappropriate times, signal conditioning, and data display and\nstorage.\nBefore measurements are to be taken from leaves, the\nelectronics or computer software records and stores the "zero\nposition Hall voltage" (V,,, o), i.e. the output voltage of the\nHall-effect sensor IC when no leaf is present between the\nHall-effect sensor IC and the magnet and the fixture is completely closed (Hall-effect sensor IC touches the magnet).\nDuring actual measurements, i.e. with a plant leaf 26\nplaced between the Hall-effect sensor IC 20 and the magnet\n22 while the gripping fixture 24 is allowed to close on the leaf\n26, the electronics or computer software records and stores\nthe measured Hall-voltage (V,,,, _f), calculates the "Hallvoltage difference to zero position" (VHaii dam) according to\nthe formula:\nH,1L_\t\nV\n\nVHa1^__1e T V\nH,11 0\n\nand calculates the corresponding leaf thickness (LT) in\nmicrometers of the leaf under test.\nMethod 2: The described sensor-system measures infrared\nlight at specific wavelengths reflected from plant leaves as a\nway to assess leaf water content and to detect plant water\ndeficit stress. The described sensor defines a variety of measurement parameters and keeps those parameters constant.\nDoing so reduces data variability to acceptable levels and\nprovides means for assessing leaf water content fruitfully.\nSpecific signatures of leaf water content indices based on\nlight reflected from leaves can indicate the dehydration of\nleaves in real-time.\nPure water exhibits 5 main absorption bands in the NIR\nlight range, centered at about 970 mu, about 1200 mu, about\n1450 mu, about 1930 mu, and at about 2500 mu. These 5 main\nwater absorption bands in the NIR range can typically be\nobserved in the form of reflectance-troughs when assessing\nlight reflected from leaves. If leaves dehydrate, for example\ndue to prolonged water deficit stress, the above named reflectance-troughs typically tend to decrease with increasing\ndehydration of the leaves. The application of a dual wavelength method utilizing one of the above named water absorbing bands in the NIR, i.e. measuring leaf reflectance at a water\nabsorbing wavelength and at a non (or weakly) absorbing\nwavelength and dividing the non-(or weakly) absorbing\nwavelength by the absorbing wavelength, can be used to\ndetermine the depth of the corresponding water absorption\ntrough in the reflectance spectrum. Applying a dual wavelength method utilizing the 1450 nm water absorbing wavelength and the 1300 nm non (or weakly) water absorbing\nwavelength for light reflected from peace lily (Spathiphyllum\nlynise) leaves exhibiting various degrees of leaf dehydration\nas characterized by the relative water content (RWC) of those\nleaves can be observed. Plotting the ratio of leaf reflectance at\n1300 nm (R1300) divided by leaf reflectance at 1450 nm\n(R1450) versus the RWC of the leaves investigated, which is\noften used to describe the water status of a leaf under test,\nshowed a significant correlation that appeared to be linear\nexhibiting a coefficient of determination (R2) of greater than\n\n10\n0.94. Therefore, the application of such a dual wavelength\nratio utilizing a water-absorbing wavelength when examining\nleaf reflectance may be used to assess the degree of leaf\nhydration, and such a dual wavelength ratio may be referred\n5 to as reflectance based leaf water index (RWI).\nHowever, even though it is easy to correlate RWI, such as\nR1300/RI450, to the RWC of leaves, the true independent\nvariable governing such a leaf water index based on reflectance is the absolute amount of water within a leaf, not the\nio RWC of leaf cells. More specifically, such a leaf water index\nbased onreflectance depends on the absolute amount ofwater\nencountered by light along its path when such light penetrates\na leaf under test and is reflected from this leaf.\nIt is generally understood that light is not simply reflected\n15 at leaf surfaces as specular reflection. Although a small percentage of light incident to the adaxial (upper) side of a leaf\nmay be specularly reflected at the leaf surface (cuticle), the\nmajority of such incident light will penetrate the leaf, which\ncan be shown by applying Fresnel\'s equations and assuming\n20 an index of refraction of 1.42 for typical leaf cell walls, as well\nas an index of refraction of 1.00 for air. Upper epidermal cells\ncommonly focus incident light into the cells of the palisade\nlayer based on their planoconvex shape. Cells of the palisade\nlayer typically guide light straight towards the layer of spongy\n25 mesophyll cells because of total inner reflection. The layer of\nmesophyll cells, consisting of irregularly shaped cells and a\nhigh proportion of intercellular air spaces, intensely scatters\nand reflects light, mainly at cell wall-to-air interfaces due to\nthe jump in the refractive index, eventually causing some light\n30 to be reflected back through the adaxial side of the leaf.\nTherefore, reflection in leaves occurs mainly at the layer of\nspongy mesophyll cells, and the majority of light reflected\nfrom leaves emanates from the interior of the leaf as diffuse\nreflection.\n35 The exact path of light reflected from leaves depends on a\nvariety of factors, such as anatomical specifics, the sizes and\nshapes of cells and their specific arrangements, and the status\nof cell-turgidity, which is why the exact path of light reflected\nfrom leaves can hardly be predicted or described. On the one\n4o hand, light reflected from leaves does not have to travel\nthrough the entire thickness of these leaves since it is likely\nreflected somewhere at the leaf interior. On the other hand,\nlight reflected from the adaxial side of leaves has traveled\nthrough the layer of palisade cells twice, thus experienced the\n45 absorber amount of water of this cell layer 2 times.\nThe absolute vertical amount of water throughout a leaf\ncross section may be approximated by the so-called equivalent water thickness (EWT) of leaves. Although the exact\npath-length of light reflected from leaves may be different\n50 from the overall thickness of these leaves, as well as different\nfrom the EWT of these leaves, leaf water indices based on\nreflectance can typically be correlated closely to the EWT of\nthese leaves. The spectral separation of light necessary for the\nabove-described method can be achieved by several means. In\n55 traditional solutions for spectral separation of light a spectrally broadly emitting light source is used as illumination\nsource, such as the sun or light bulbs. Spectral separation of\nlight into wavelengths of interest is than achieved by applying\nspecific spectral filters in front of receiving/sensing elements,\n60 or by applying various techniques for more complete spectral\nanalysis, such as by splitting light into the spectrum utilizing\nprisms, gratings, and similar means.\nAnother technique of spectral separation of light in spectral\nanalysis of matter is to apply light sources emitting only at\n65 wavelengths of interest, such as lasers or light emitting diodes\n(LED\'s), which is used by this invention.

The TIR-water index\n(TIRWI) is finally calculated by the formula:\n\nEach family of plant leaf pigments exhibits its own characteristic absorption spectra. When assessing light reflected\nfrom or transmitted through leaves, the absorption spectra of\nall pigment families involved overlap, creating an integrated\nabsorption spectrum. Throughout the 400-500 nm range, different individual absorption bands overlap, creating high\nabsorbance over this wavelength range without any clearly\nidentifiable maximum of absorbance, so that this spectral\nrange can likely not be used for the principle of pressure\nshifting of spectral absorption bands.\nWithin the 550-750 mu range, different individual absorption bands overlap as well. The observable integrated absorption spectrum throughout this range, however, does exhibit a\nclearly identifiable absorption maximum, usually occurring\nat about 650 nm, caused by absorption of leaf pigments, such\nas chlorophyll and carotenoids. The following evaluation\nexamined the exact occurrence of this absorption maximum,\ni.e. the center wavelength of this absorption band. In preparation of this experiment, various peace lily (Spathiphyllum\nlynise) plants were subjected to various degrees of desiccation, creating a variety of leaf RWC. Spectral reflectance was\nmeasured using a spectroradiometer scanning the 350-2500\nmu wavelength range (Field Spec Pro FR, Analytical Spectral\nDevices, Inc., Boulder, Colo.). Spectral resolution of this\ndevice was about 2 mu in the 350-1000 mu range, and about\n5 mu in the 1000-2500 mu range. In order to calculate the\ncenter wavelength of the 650 mu absorption band, software\nwritten in Labview (National Instruments, Corp., Austin,\nTex.) was fed with the obtained reflectance spectra. The software examined the 550-750 mu range only and determined\nthroughout this range the wavelength at which minimum\nreflectance, i.e. maximum absorbance, occurred.\nIn the infrared (IR) range, leaf absorption by pigments\nbecomes negligible and the five typically observable absorption bands throughout the 750-2500 mu wavelength range are\ncaused by water exclusively. The following evaluation examined the occurrence of the absorption maximum of the 1450\nmu absorption band using the same procedure as described\nabove for the 650 mu absorption band. A dependency of the\noccurrence of the 650 mu leaf absorption band upon leaf\ndehydration may be observable for light reflected from\nleaves.\nHowever, within the 350-1000 mu wavelength range the\nspectral resolution of the spectroradiometer used was only\nabout 2 nm and within the 1000-2500 nm wavelength range\nthe spectral resolution of the spectroradiometer used was only\nabout 5 mu. Indeed, noise on the order of about 2-5 mu can be\nobserved. Therefore, if the effect of pressure shifting of\nabsorption bands indeed exhibits a sensitivity of only about\n0.1 nm per MPa, as described by Freiberg et al. (1993), the\nspectroradiometer was too insensitive in terms of its spectral\nresolution to resolve the effect for natural turgor pressures of\nabout 2.0 MPa maximum.\nTherefore, the use of spectroradiometers, or other devices\nproviding spectral separation such as spectrally tunable\nlasers, with higher spectral resolution than the spectroradiometer used in the experiments described above may be able\nto resolve the effect of pressure shifting of absorption bands\nas a way to measure turgor pressure of leaf cells much better.\nIn particular, if such spectroradiometers or other devices\nwould offer a spectral resolution of below 0.1 mu they may be\nable to resolve the effect of pressure shifting of absorption\nbands for natural changes of turgor pressure occurring in leaf\ncells.\nThe application of spectroradiometers or other devices\nexhibiting spectral resolution of below 0.1 mu is practically\nfeasible. Examples for commercially available equipment\nalready offering such high spectral resolution include the\nHR4000 high-resolution spectroradiometer of Ocean Optics\noffering a spectral resolution of about 0.02 mu with appropriate optical configuration (Ocean Optics, Inc., Dunedin,\n\nTIRWI=T1300M450.\n\nMethod 4: The present method of measuring turgor pres- 5\nsure in plants utilizes the principle of "pressure broadening\nand shifting of spectral absorption bands".\nThe principle of pressure broadening describes the change\nof the shape of spectral absorption bands, or absorption lines,\nas a function of pressure applied towards an absorbing material. It is generally known that the width of absorption bands, 10\nor absorption lines, typically defined as the full width at half\nmaximum (FWHM), increases if pressure increases. It has\nalso been observed in numerous applications that the occurrence of the maximum of absorbance, or absorption band\ncenter wavelength, may shift to different wavelengths ifpres- 15\nsure increases. These pressure changes can typically be\nobserved for relatively small pressure changes in gases. In\nliquids and solids these effects can only be observed under at\nleast one of two conditions: comparably large fluctuations of\npressure or high spectral resolution of the measurement 20\nequipment.\nLight transmitted through a plant leaf exhibits characteristic absorption bands, such as absorption bands caused by\nwater, various types of chlorophyll, or other types of leaf\npigments. The same is true for light reflected from leaves 25\nsince light reflection occurs mainly at the interior of leaves,\nmore specifically mostly at the layer of spongy mesophyll\ncells, hence reflected light has traveled through a leaf under\ntest to quite some extent. The absorbing materials causing\nthese various absorption bands are typically exposed to the\npressure within leaf cells, which is the turgor pressure of leaf 30\ncells. Thus, the exact spectral occurrences of the absorption\nmaxima of the above described absorptionbands of water and\nleaf pigments, or absorption band center wavelengths, should\nbe a function of the turgor pressure of the cells of a leaf under\ntest. By measuring the spectrum of light reflected from or 35\ntransmitted through leaves, by observing the exact spectral\noccurrence of the absorption maximum of certain absorption\nbands, and by applying the principle of pressure shifting of\nspectral absorption bands it is therefore theoretically possible\nto use this principle as a novel tool for measuring the turgor 40\npressure of cells in plant leaves non-destructively and in\nreal-time.\nPlease refer to FIG. 4. The effect of pressure on the absorption characteristics of the light harvesting pigment protein\ncomplex (LHC) of membranes of the purple bacteria Rhodosphirilum rubrum at room temperature has been studied. 45\nSince the prepared protein complexes of this experiment were\nplaced in water solution, these experiments resemble the\nnatural environment of cells in plant leaves containing various protein complexes. When the absorbance from the above\nnamed solution was measured, the LHC exhibited a single 50\nabsorption band in the very near infrared (VNIR) light range,\ncentered at about 865 mu at ambient pressure of about one\natmosphere (1 arm). When pressure higher than 1 arm was\napplied to this solution, the FWHM of the absorption band\ncentered at 865 mu at 1 arm increased. More importantly, the 55\ncenter wavelength of this absorption band, i.e. the wavelength\nof maximum absorbance, shifted towards higher wavelength\nunder pressure, and the observed shift of the absorption band\ncenter wavelength appeared to be a linear function of the\npressure being applied.\nThe pressures applied were much higher compared to tur- 60\ngor pressures occurring naturally in plant leaves. The maximum values of turgor pressure in plant leaf cells are typically\nbetween about 0.5 MPa and about 2.0 MPa. Scaling the shift\nof the absorption band center wavelength down to natural\nturgor pressures in plant leaf cells yields a shift of the center 65\nwavelength of the above-described LHC absorption band of\nabout 0.1 nm per MPa.\n\nUS 7,660,698 B1\n17\nFla.; Ocean Optics, 2004), miniature spectroradiometers\nknown as optical channel monitors (OCM) typically used in\ntelecommunication applications offering a spectral resolution\nof about 0.025 urn, or the varieties of spectrally tunable lasers,\nsuch as the ECL5000DT tunable laser of THORLABS offering a spectral resolution of 0.001 urn (spectral line width 150\nkHz FWHM) (THORLABS, Inc., Newton, N.7.; THORLABS, 2005).\nIn addition to the use of spectroradiometers or other\ndevices with high spectral resolution of below 0.1 mu, mathematical procedures could be used in order to increase the\nspectral resolution of the method for measuring turgor pressure in leaf cells using the principle of spectral shifting of\nabsorption bands virtually. So far, the method described here\ndetermined the occurrence of maximum absorbance, or\nabsorbance band center wavelength, by feeding software with\nthe obtained spectrum of interest, and the software would\ndetermine the occurrence of maximum absorbance by determining the wavelength at which, for example, minimum\nreflectance, i.e. maximum absorbance, of an absorption band\nof interest occurs. Clearly, such a procedure is limited in its\nspectral resolution to the spectral resolution of the spectrum\nobtained, i.e. is limited to the spectral resolution of the spectroradiometer, or other device, used for obtaining the spectrum. In order to increase spectral resolution virtually one\ncould apply mathematical curve fitting procedures to the\nspectrum obtained. This way, the set of real data of the spectrum with its limited spectral resolution is replaced with an\nexact mathematical model, or function, of the obtained\nabsorption band. The mathematical function, of course, offers\na much higher theoretical spectral resolution compared to the\nset of real data of the spectrum obtained. Differentiating the\nmathematical function of the absorption band and solving this\ndifferentiated function for zero calculates an exact wavelength at which maximum absorption of the absorption band\nexamined occurred. With this procedure the spectral resolution of determining the occurrence of absorption maximum of\nan absorption band can virtually be increased extremely. The\nlimiting factor of this procedure is "how good the mathematical function can be fitted to the set of real data". However,\napplying well fitting mathematical functions to the real sets of\ndata of absorption bands promises to increase the spectral\nresolution substantially when determining the exact occurrence of absorption band maxima.\nFurthermore, it was noticed earlier that the true independent variable for the principle of pressure shifting of spectral\nabsorption bands is the change in density of the absorbing\nmaterial. The density of materials, however, depends on the\npressure being applied and the temperature. In fact, temperature may have a much larger impact on changes in the density\nof water than pressure does. Thus, temperature fluctuations\nmay influence the shift of spectral absorption bands in the\nsame way as pressure fluctuations would. Therefore, the temperature of the absorbing material, in the case of turgor pressure in leaf cells the temperature of leaves under test, need to\nbe measured and taken into account when determining the\nturgor pressure of leaf cells using the principle of pressure\nshifting of spectral absorption bands. Alternatively, the temperature of the absorbing material, in the case of measuring\nthe turgor pressure of leaf cells the temperature of the leaf\nunder test, may be actively controlled to a certain defined\ntemperature, and kept constant throughout the measurement,\nwhich would eliminate the influence of temperature leaving\nturgor pressure to be the only contributor to influence the shift\n\n18\nof spectral absorption bands when measuring light reflected\nfrom or transmitted through plant leaves.\nThe present invention provides a method of determining\nthe turgor pressure in a plant by shining light through a leaf or\n5 measuring the light reflected from the leaf; spectrally examining typical absorption bands of chlorophyll, other pigments, or water; determine the turgor pressure inside the leaf\nbased on the senter-wavelength of the absorption bands.\nSpectral examination can be done by using a broad light\nemitting source and a spectrometer as the receiving element,\n10\nor using a spectrally tunable laser and a simple spectrally\nbroad receiving element such as a photodiode, for example.\nAlthough this invention has been described with respect to\nspecific embodiments, it is not intended to be limited thereto\nand various modifications which will become apparent to the\n15 person of ordinary skill in the art are intended to fall within\nthe spirit and scope of the invention as described herein taken\nin conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the\nappended claims.\nThe invention claimed is:\n20 1.
