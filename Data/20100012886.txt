The NATO Human View is a system architectural viewpoint that focuses on the human as part\nof a system. Its purpose is to capture the human requirements and to inform on how the human impacts\nthe system design. The viewpoint contains seven static models that include different aspects of the\nhuman element, such as roles, tasks, constraints, training and metrics. It also includes a Human\nDynamics component to perform simulations of the human system under design. One of the static\nmodels, termed Human Networks, focuses on the human-to-human communication patterns that occur as\na result of ad hoc or deliberate team formation, especially teams distributed across space and time.\nParameters of human teams that effect system performance can be captured in this model. Human\ncentered aspects of networks, such as differences in operational tempo (sense of urgency), priorities\n(common goal), and team history (knowledge of the other team members), can be incorporated. The\ninformation captured in the Human Network static model can then be included in the Human Dynamics\ncomponent so that the impact of distributed teams is represented in the simulation. As the NATO\nmilitaries transform to a more networked force, the Human View architecture is an important tool that can\nbe used to make recommendations on the proper mix of technological innovations and human\ninteractions.\n\nindividuals performing roles in the same or\ndifferent locations and the same or different\norganizations. The performance of the process\nsupported by the human network is affected by\nthe assignment of roles, responsibilities, and the\nexistence of needed relationships. Attributes of\nhuman networks can also be implemented in a\ndynamic model to simulate the effect on process\nperformance outcomes. The Human View\nArchitecture can "effectively use information\ntechnology to rapidly mesh the individual skills of\nstrangers into interdependent work products" [7].\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nAt the Prague Summit in November 2002, NATO\nrecognized that transformation of the military\nbased upon information age principles was\nessential, and pursued a course of transformation\ntermed NATO Network-Enabled Capabilities\n(NNEC)1. The objective was to initiate a culture of\ninformation sharing to induce better situational\nawareness, faster decision making, and improved\ncollaboration between nations. The potential\nNNEC benefits would also include improved\nefficiency, increased interoperability between\nnations, secure information sharing, improved\ninformation quality, and faster speed of\ncommand. While NNEC is often perceived as a\ntechnical transformation, in practice NNEC\nemphasizes people first, then processes, and\nfinally technology. The challenge of NNEC is to\nachieve the proper mix of new human behaviors\nand competencies, organizational changes, and\ninnovative technologies.\n\n2. THE NATO HUMAN VIEW\n\nThe\nNATO\nResearch\nand\nTechnology\nOrganization (RTO) Human Factors and\nMedicine (HFM) Panel 155 convened a Human\nView Workshop in July 2007 to discuss and\npropose a cross-national Human View; that is an\narchitectural viewpoint that focuses on the human\nas part of a system. A Human View is required to\nexplicitly represent the human and to document\nthe unique implications humans bring to the\nsystem. The workshop panel evaluated emerging\nhuman view concepts, proposed a candidate\nhuman view construct, and developed an outline\nof a NATO-wide Human View. The Human View\nwas designed to be independent of any specific\narchitecture framework and adaptable to different\nprocesses. The outcomes of the workshop\nresulted in the definition of a NATO Human View\ncomposed of eight products [5].\n\nIn order to make the transformation to NNEC,\nmethodologies on how to represent the\nintegration of technology and human/social\nsystems are needed. The objective of this paper\nis to describe the NATO Human View\nArchitecture, and specifically the Human Network\nproduct. Human networks can connect different\n\n\'http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-1 F7151 AF2FE364A 1/natolive/topics_54644.htm\n\n181\n\npredict the impact of operator attributes on\nsystem performance. Trade off analyses can also\nbe conducted to determine the impact of system\nparameters on human performance metrics.\n\nThe NATO Human View can be used to capture\nthe human requirements and the way that\nhumans interact with other elements of a system.\nIt can be a design aid to specify future systems or\nit can be the basis for a methodology to answer\nquestions regarding systems that have alre~dy\nbeen created. The main focus of the Human View\nis to capture human data and information about\nthe interactions between humans and between\nhumans and other elements of a system. The set\nof eight products that compose the NATO Human\nView are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HV-A: Concept - a conceptual, high-level\nrepresentation of the human component in\nthe enterprise architecture.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HV-B: Contraints - sets of characteristics\nthat are used to adjust the expected roles\nand tasks based on the capabilities and\nlimitations of the human in the system.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HV-C: Tasks - descriptions of the humanspecific activities in the system.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HV-D: Roles - descriptions of the roles that\nhave been defined for the humans interacting\nwith other elements of the system.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HV-E: Human Network - the human to human\ncommunication patterns that occur as a result\nof ad hoc or deliberate team formation,\nespecially teams distributed across space\nand time.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HV-F: Training - a detailed accounting of how\nand\ntraining\nrequirements,\nstrategy,\nimplementation will impact the human.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HV-G: Metrics - a repository for humanrelated values, priorities and performance\ncriteria, that maps human factors metrics to\nany other Human View elements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HV-H: Human Dynamics - dynamic aspects\nof human system components defined in\nother views.\nThe objective of the Human Dynamics (HV-H)\nproduct is to capture the interaction of the human\nsystem components defined in the other products\n(HV-A to HV-G). The design decisions recorded\nin the static Human View products can be\nappraised through a dynamic evaluation of the\nhuman system performance using the Human\nDynamics. A tool such as the Improved\nPerformance\nResearch\nIntegration\nTool\n(IMPRINT)2, a human performance modeling tool\ndeveloped by the US Army Research Laboratory\n(ARL), can be used to implement the Human\nDynamics product and help system developers\n\n3. HUMAN NETWORK (HV-E)\nThe Human Network (HV-E) product focuses on\nthe interaction of the human elements of the\nsystem: what nodes they reside at, how the\nhuman functions are distributed and what\ntechnology-based\ncommunication\nnetwork\nenables collaboration. The HV-E maps frequent\nor critical types of information exchanges related\nto human roles as a way of expressing\ncommunication-based dependencies; this may\nto\ninclude\ninformation\nexchange\nlinks\ntechnological systems [1]. Elements of the HV-E\nmay include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Role groupings or teams formed,\nincluding the physical proximity of the\nroles and virtual roles included for\nspecific team tasks.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Type of interaction - i.e., collaborate,\ncoordinate, supervise, etc.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Team cohesiveness indicators - i.e.,\ntrust, sharing, etc.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Team performance impacts\ni.e.,\nsynchronization (battle rhythm), level of\nengagement (command directed).\ni.e.,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Team\ndependencies\nfrequency/degree of interaction between\nroles.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 CommunicationlTechnology impact to the\nteam network - i.e., distributed cognition,\nshared awareness, common operational\npicture, etc.\nThe HV-E architecture product can be\ndecomposed into several sub views to represe~t\ndifferent types of information. An example of thiS\nis shown in Figure 1. The HV-E has been\nsubdivided: HV-E1 Role Groupings (Teams), HVE2 Team Interactions, and HV-E3 Information\nRequirements. This figure also shows the\ninterconnections between the HV-E and other\narchitectural products, including Operational\nSystem Views (SV).\nViews (OV) and\n\nhttp://www.arl.army.miIlARLDirectorates/HRED/imb/imprint/lmprint7.htm\n\n2\n\n182\n\nHuman\nOrganizational\nRelationships\n\nRoles\nHV-D1\n\n\'---_--"-O_V_-4~---.J ~.\nNodes\n\n!\n\n!\n\nRole Groupings Teams\n.\n(Teams)\n. . - Team Interactions\n\n.\nOperational\nNodes\nOV\xc2\xb72\n\n_\n\n!_~~_._._.\nHV-E\n\nHV-E1\n\nInformation\nRequirements\n\n!\n\n~ ~;::~:\n\nHV-E3\n\nl ._ .. _. _.\n\n. _ _ .. _. _ .. _ .. _. _. _. _\n\nHV-E2\n\n~\n_\n\n.\n\nI\n\n._. _ ..\n\nCommlXl\'cat,on\n\nPaths\nr-------\'\'\'---------,\n\nOperational Information\nExchange Matrix\nOV-3\n\nSystem\nReqUirements\n\nSystem Interface\nDescription SV\xc2\xb711\nSystems Communication\nDescription SV-2\n\nFigure 1: Human Network Relationships\n\nwhat networks are active between locations.\nAdditionally, the roles (ovals) are shown grouped\nby their work centers (boxes).\n\n4. HUMAN NETWORK AND DYNAMICS\nThe need for a technology-supported human\ninformation network is often driven by a\nreachback situation. Reachback is "the process\nof obtaining products, services, and applications,\nor forces, or equipment, or material from\n3\norganizations that are not forward deployed ."\nThis term is becoming Widely used in the military\ncommunity to indicate a virtual team. Virtual\nteams exist when decision-making activities are\ndistributed across a team and the team is also\ndistributed across physical locations. This has\nimplications as to which types of communication\nmedia are suitable, how complex data can be\nshared so they are meaningful, how to organize\nteam members across locations to minimize\ntechnology needs, or where to place the authority\nto ensure effective communication of commands\n\nThe Human Dynamics captures the interaction of\nthe human system components defined in the\nother products. The impact on performance of the\ninformation captured in the Human Networks\nproduct can be assessed through the dynamic\nmodel.\nFor\nexample,\nhuman\nnetworks,\nrepresenting a collaborative team, can connect\ndifferent individuals fulfilling roles in the same or\ndifferent locations and the same or different\norganizations. The performance of the process\nsupported by the human network is affected by\nthe assignment of roles, the organizations to\nwhich they belong, and the connectivity between\nthem. Personnel fulfilling designated roles must\nhave the training and experience required to\ncomplete the task and roles in different\norganizations may have different leadership\nstyles and procedures. Collaborative teams also\nhave differing degrees of situation awareness\nand team history. Remote nodes experience the\ngreatest impact of system connectivity and\ninteroperability. Table 1 identifies the three\nhuman-related\nentities\nof\nrole,\ncenter\n(organization) and collaborative team, the\nrelevant attributes of each entity, the baseline\nrequirement in a co-located situation, and the\nimpact on specific performance variables as\nreach back may impact each attribute.\n\n[1 ].\nAn example of a HV-E, shown in Figure 2,\ndepicts the collaboration requirements of a\ndistributed military team. The need to conduct an\noperational activity shared between several roles\ncreates the need for communication independent\nof where they are located and the need for\ntechnology supporting collaborative work. Some\nof the variables that may be inferred from the\ndiagram include: which roles are at which\nlocations, which activities are performed by what\nrole, what roles need to share information, and\n3 Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, US Department\nof Defense, 2005\n\n183\n\nFWD/AFLOAT\n\nRBKlASHORE\n\nMOC Command Element\n\nComrrun,callon and\n\nInformatton Systems Center\n\n1 - - - - - - - - - - - - , COA = Course of Action\nLEGEND\nCOG = Center of Gravity\nWithin Center\nCOPS = Current Operations\n\n_\n\nIPS = Intelligence Preparation of\nBattlefield\nMOC = Maritime Command Center\n\nAcross Centers\nReach Back\n\nFigure 2: Human Network (HV-E) Example [4].\n\nTable 1: Reachback Impacts\nEntity\n\nAttribute\n\nBaseline Requirement\n\nPerformance Impact\n(as deviate from Baseline)\n\nRole\n\nTraining &\nExperience\n\nFully capable to complete task.\n\nAccuracy\n\nCenter (Organization)\n\nLeadership &\nObjectives\n\nCommon goal, sense of\nurgency and commitment.\n\nTimeliness\n\nCenter (Organization)\n\nGuidance &\nProcedures\n\nSame/similar task, techniques,\nand procedures.\n\nAccuracy\n\nCollaborative Team\n\nShared\nAwareness\n\nRemote roles currently\nengaged in the operation\n\nCompleteness\n\nCollaborative Team\n\nTeam History\n\nPrior interaction with the team\n- leads to understanding of\nwhat knowledge, expertise,\nand resources each member\npossesses and requires.\n\nCompleteness\n\nSystem\n\nConnectivity/\nReliability/\nAccessibility\n\nReliable and adequate\ncommunication; access to\nnecessary information.\n\nTimeliness\n\n184\n\n5.\n\nrepresented\nby\nthe\nKnowledge-to-Task\nrelationship. Team History involves knowing who\nknows what; this is represented by the People-toKnowledge relationships; see Table 2.\n\nHUMAN DYNAMICS IMPLEMENTATION\n\nThe Improved Performance Research Integration\nTool (IMPRINT) is a human performance\nmodeling tool to help system developers predict\nthe impact of operator attributes on system\nperformance. IMPRINT can be used to predict\nthe impact of design decisions captured in the\nHV-E on the performance of the operators of a\nsystem; the system can then be optimized by\nbuilding models representing alternative human\nand technology allocations [6]. Data are entered\nthrough user interfaces and task-network\ndiagrams;\nunderlying\nhuman\nperformance\nalgorithms are then employed to perform\nsimulations. IMPRINT incorporates task analysis,\nworkload modeling, performance shaping and\ndegradation functions and stressors, and\nembedded\npersonnel\ncharacteristics\ndata.\nPerformance time and accuracy requirements are\ncollected and workload profiles are generated so\nthat role-workload distribution and role-system\ntask allocation can be examined.\n\nTable 2: People, Knowledge & Tasks Network [2J\n\nPeople\n\nKnowledge\n\nTasks\n\nPeople\nWho\nknows\nwho\n\nKnowledge\nWho knows\nwhat: Team\n\nTasks\n\nWho\nwhat\n\ndoes\n\nHistory\n\nWhat\ninforms what\n\nKnowledge\nneeded:\nShared\nAwareness\n\nWhat task\nhas\nprecedence\n\nBoth the People-to-Knowledge and Knowledgeto-Tasks relationships effect workload outcomes\nand can be assessed using components of\ncognitive load. Cognitive load is increased when\nthe individual roles are more interdependent\n(increased cognitive demand) and require more\ninteraction\nbetween\nroles\n(increased\nis\nmore\ncommunication\ndemand);\nthis\npronounced in a reachback situation. Therefore,\nthe cognitive and speech/auditory parameters\nwithin IMPRINT can be used as surrogate\nvariables to represent the presence of reach back\nin a simulation model.\n\nIn order to demonstrate how the variables\ncaptured in the HV-E product can impact the\nHuman Dynamics model, a methodology to\nimplement reachback in an IMPRINT model was\ndevised. First the entity types of the Human\nNetwork diagram were identified. Secondly, the\nattributes of the entity that vary under a\nreach back or co-located situations were\ndescribed,\nalong\nwith\ntheir impact on\nperformance. Finally, based on network theory\nresearch, workload demand differences that can\nbe manipulated in the IMPRINT model were\nidentified.\n\nReachback can be implemented in the model by\nadjusting these parameters as shown in Table 3.\nThe IMPRINT simulation can then be configured\nto use the correct parameter when the\ninteractions between team members are in either\na co-located or a reach back condition. The\nimpact of the difference will be reflected in the\noverall role workload, which in turn impacts the\ntimeliness and accuracy of the work process\nbeing simulated. For example, as shown in\nFigure 2, there is a reach back condition between\nthe Intelligence Center and the Future Plans\nCenter. When these nodes communicate\nadditional\nworkload\nis\nadded\nto\nthe\ncommunication function in the model. This\nincreases the overall workload of each role, and if\nit surpasses a set workload limit, it will cause a\ndetriment in the performance of the role\'s\nfunctions. Several variables will impact the\nseverity of the performance impact, including the\nworkload threshold, the timeliness penalty, and\nthe workload management strategy. This may\ninclude dropping tasks, off-loading tasks and/or\ndelaying tasks.\n\nAs an example of how reach back can be\nincorporated in the IMPRINT model and affect the\nperformance outcomes, the two "collaborative\nteam" entity attributes from Table 1 were\nexplored further. Research on network theory has\ncharacterized\nCommand,\nControl,\n(C31)\nCommunications\nand\nIntelligence\narchitectures by the elements of People,\nKnowledge and Tasks and has defined the set of\nsix relationships linking them, defined as a MetaNetwork [3]. The Meta-Network also defines\nmeasures to assess each of the six defined\nrelationships. By mapping the entity attributes of\nShared Awareness and Team History to the\nMeta-Network, the resulting measures can be\nused as surrogate variables in the IMPRINT\nmodel to represent differing degrees of\nreach back. Shared Awareness involves knowing\nwhat knowledge is needed for a task; this is\n\n185\n\nTable 3: Reachback adjustments to IMPRINT Parameters\nEntity I Attribute\n\nMeta-Network\nRelationship\n\nIMPRINT Workload Demand Settings\xc2\xb7\n*Workload Demand scale is 0 to 7\n\nWithout Reachback\n\nWith Reachback\nCognitive 6.8\nEval/Judge/Consider\nSeveral Aspects\nSpeech - 4.0 Complex\n(Sentence)\nAuditory 6.0 Interpret\nSpeech Complex\n(Sentences)\n\nCollaborative Team:\nShared Awareness\n\nKnowledge-to-Tasks\n\nCognitive - 4.6\nEval/Judgel Consider\nSingle Aspect\n\nCollaborative Team:\nTeam History\n\nPeople-to-Knowledge\n\nSpeech 2.0 Simple\nAuditory 3.0 Simple\n\n=\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n6. CONCLUSION\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFor network-based operations, such as NATO\nNNEC, the collaboration requirements between\ndistributed roles and the resulting communication\npatterns are of particular importance. The NATO\nHuman View product, Human Networks, focuses\non capturing the parameters and variables that\ncharacterize\nthe\nhuman\ncommunication\nprocesses and can provide the necessary data\nfor a simulation model for evaluation of networkbased systems.\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\nThe NATO Human View is currently being\nevaluated for integration into the NATO\nArchitecture Framework (NAF) 3.0 through the\nHuman\nViews\nextension\nto\nEnterprise\nArchitecture project. Through this process, the\nNNEC elements for the Human View products\nhave been defined, the integration of these\nproducts into the overall framework has been\ndesigned, and example Human View products\nhave been created for the NAF Running\nExample. These documents have been posted on\nthe NATO TIDEPEDIA4 for comment and\nevaluation.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\nBy providing a mechanism for capturing the\nrequired data to characterize the human\ninteractions, the Human Network provides a\nvaluable tool for designing human centered\nsystems and evaluating the impact of the human\ncomponent on the overall system. As the NATO\nmilitaries transform to a more networked force,\nthe Human View architecture is an important tool\nthat can be used to make recommendations on\nthe proper mix of technological innovations and\nhuman roles, interactions, and behaviors.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n4http://tide.act.nato.intlmediawikilindex.php/Human_Views_ex\ntension_to_Enterprise_Architecture_project\n\n186\n\nBruseberg, A.
