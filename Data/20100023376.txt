GSC-15728-1\n\nDistributed Observer\nNetwork\nThe Distributed Observer network\n(DON) is a NASA-collaborative environment that leverages game technology to\nbring three-dimensional simulations to\nconventional desktop and laptop computers in order to allow teams of engineers working on design and operations,\neither individually or in groups, to view\nand collaborate on 3D representations\nof data generated by authoritative tools\nsuch as Delmia Envision, Pro/Engineer,\nor Maya. The DON takes models and\ntelemetry from these sources and, using\ncommercial game engine technology,\ndisplays the simulation results in a 3D visual environment.\nDON has been designed to enhance accessibility and user ability to observe and\nanalyze visual simulations in real time. A\nvariety of NASA mission segment simulations [Synergistic Engineering Environment (SEE) data, NASA Enterprise Visualization Analysis (NEVA) ground\nprocessing simulations, the DSS simulation for lunar operations, and the Johnson Space Center (JSC) TRICK tool for\nguidance, navigation, and control analysis] were experimented with. Desired\nfunctionalities, [i.e. Tivo-like functions,\nthe capability to communicate textually or\nvia Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2010\n\namong team members, and the ability to\nwrite and save notes to be accessed later]\nwere targeted. The resulting DON application was slated for early 2008 release to\nsupport simulation use for the Constellation Program and its teams.\nThose using the DON connect\nthrough a client that runs on their PC or\nMac. This enables them to observe and\nanalyze the simulation data as their\nschedule allows, and to review it as frequently as desired. DON team members\ncan move freely within the virtual world.\nPreset camera points can be established,\nenabling team members to jump to specific views. This improves opportunities\nfor shared analysis of options, design reviews, tests, operations, training, and\nevaluations, and improves prospects for\nverification of requirements, issues, and\napproaches among dispersed teams.\nThis work was done by Michael Conroy, Rebecca Mazzone, William Little, and Priscilla\nElfrey of Kennedy Space Center; David Mann\nof ASRC Aerospace; and Kevin Mabie,\nThomas Cuddy, Mario Loundermon, Stephen\nSpiker, Don Whiteside, Frank McArthur, Tate\nSrey, and Dennis Bonilla of Valador Inc.

KSC-13081\n\nComputer-Automated\nEvolution of Spacecraft\nX-Band Antennas\nA document discusses the use of computer-aided evolution in arriving at a\n\ndesign for X-band communication antennas for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s three Space Technology 5 (ST5) satellites, which were\nlaunched on March 22, 2006. Two evolutionary algorithms, incorporating different representations of the antenna\ndesign and different fitness functions,\nwere used to automatically design and\noptimize an X-band antenna design. A\nset of antenna designs satisfying initial\nST5 mission requirements was evolved\nby use these algorithms.\nThe two best antennas \xe2\x80\x94 one from\neach evolutionary algorithm \xe2\x80\x94 were\nbuilt. During flight-qualification testing\nof these antennas, the mission requirements were changed. After minimal\nchanges in the evolutionary algorithms\n\xe2\x80\x94 mostly in the fitness functions \xe2\x80\x94 new\nantenna designs satisfying the changed\nmission requirements were evolved and\nwithin one month of this change, two\nnew antennas were designed and prototypes of the antennas were built and\ntested. One of these newly evolved antennas was approved for deployment on\nthe ST5 mission, and flight-qualified\nversions of this design were built and installed on the spacecraft. At the time of\nwriting the document, these antennas\nwere the first computer-evolved hardware in outer space.\nThis work was done by Jason D. Lohn of\nAmes Research Center and Gregory S. Hornby\nof the University of California Santa Cruz\nand Derek S. Linden of JEM Engineering.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1). ARC-15568-1\n\n15\n\n'
