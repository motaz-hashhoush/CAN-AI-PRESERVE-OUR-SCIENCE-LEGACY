Likewise, long-term storable liquid propellant candidates that offer significant reduction in personnel hazards and shorter payload processing schedules present a more attractive propulsion subsystem solution to spacecraft builders. Aiming to reduce risk to potential infusion missions and fully comprehend the alternative propellant performance, the work presented herein represents many years of development and collaborative efforts to successfully align higher performance, low toxicity green propellants into NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) missions. High Performance Green Propulsion (HPGP), and the associated propellant technology, has advanced significantly in maturity with increased familiarity with LMP-103S propellant handling, the proven reduction in loading hazards, successful launches conducted at multiple international Ranges, and HPGP on-orbit flight heritage. As science missions move forward to the potential infusion of HPGP technology, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and its partners are working to address gaps in system performance and operational considerations.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Spain", "submissionId": 20180003008, "endDate": "2018-05-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "French Aeronautics and Space Society (3AF)", "location": "Paris, France"}}, "meetingId": "d918bd8e28b34237a9b9aa55a4d8682e", "id": "2594169fa9874cfc9a4e653026d9dace"}], "name": "3AF Space Propulsion Conference", "location": "Seville", "id": "d918bd8e28b34237a9b9aa55a4d8682e", "startDate": "2018-05-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180003008, "id": "97c19f7cfc5e4d3595124db1b0f04950", "publicationDate": "2018-05-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180003008.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180003008/downloads/20180003008.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180003008/downloads/20180003008.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180003008/downloads/20180003008.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
