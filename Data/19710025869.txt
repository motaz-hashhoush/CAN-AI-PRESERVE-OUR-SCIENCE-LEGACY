Seal\n\nleakage rate was to be less than 1 x 10 -\n7 scc helium per second\n\nat one atmosphere-differential pressure. These are the basic\n\ndesign goals set for this program.\n\nThe low current switch, 1242-1, met all\'design goals and passed\n\nall testing without requiring further design or modification.\n\nThe 1241-1 switch met design goals; however, terminal strength\n\ndid not meet torque requirements and further design is necessary\n\nto elevate this switch to production status. Due to need for\n\nredesign of terminal studs, the switch will necessarily exceed\n\nit\'s original envelope by a small amount, to allow for a thicker\n\nterminal seat and the stud material will also have to be changed\n\nto meet torque requirements.\n\n\nPRE-DESIGN\n\nPre-design involved investigation of the study with respect to\n\nschedule and with respect to particular design problems to be\n\novercome.\n\nBasic requirements are that the seal must be true hermetic and\n\nthat switch configuration must be retained. Seal interfaces to\n\nbe considered are the header to housing seal, screw heads to\n\nhousing, and header and terminal seals.\n\nThe terminals presented the greatest problem since they had to\n\ninterface with the present switches and also had to be fusion\n\nsealed. As a result, some internal switch parts had to be revised\n\nfor this study. These parts were revised only to meet new inter\xc2\xad\nface requirements and were not revised from their actual function.\n\nThe high current terminal was the greatest problem since it was a\n\nspecial design that appeared to have no predecessors among terminal\n\nmanufacturers. Initially, it appeared that the terminals would\n\n\nhave to be manufactured independently of the header, and then\n\n\n5WiELEDYNE\nKINETICS\n\nPage 2\n\n\nfused to the header. Since terminal seal interfaces could be\n\ndamaged by heat shock, it was felt that terminals would have to\n\nbe attached to the header utilizing high temperature solder.\n\nThis would provide high temperature switch operation and also\n\nhigh stud torque capability. A layout was made of the switch\xc2\xad\nterminal interfaces, and subsequently drawings of the terminals\n\nwere prepared and sent to more than thirteen vendors. Vendor\n\nresponse showed the high current feed-thru to be beyond the\n\ncapability of many vendors and a special design for those few\n\nvendors who repsonded favorably. After discussion with the\n\nvendor finally selected, it was decided to integrate terminals\n\nand header into one assembly. The terminals and header are\n\nto be nickel plated for corrosion resistance and for solderability.\n\nHeader plate material for the high current terminals is to be\n\nstainless steel and ceramic insulators kill be used for the feed\xc2\xad\nthrus. The 1242-1 header material is to be cold rolled steel\n\nand glass insulators will be utilized.\n\nScrews are utilized to retain the header to the switching unit\n\nand to retain the housing and the switching unit. This problem,\n\nof how to seal the screw heads effectively, is not readily\n\nsolved. With the present configuration, welding is out of\n\nconsideration and so is brazing. it appears that a solder\n\nfillet at the screw head is the best means of sealing in that\n\narea so the least heat input is applied to switch non-metallic\n\nparts. It is conceivable that welding could be considered if\n\nthe screw heads were redesigned to permit welding, and if header\n\nmaterial and housing material are of a weldable alloy. Since\n\nterminal design was the primary problem and since\'it\'s final\n\ndesign would affect the screw to header material interface, it\n\nwas initially seen that screws should be soldered. Terminals\n\nwere initially to be soldered to the header; but, since an\n\nintegral header will now be made, it could be possible to seal\n\nheader screws by welding, if special design is undertaken. The\n\npress of schedule rules out this possibility at present, since\n\ntime and testing would be involved before design could be com\xc2\xad\npleted.\n\nHousing design involves a change in materials, if welding is to\n\nbe considered. Alternatives for the housing seal are electron\n\nbeam welding, laser welding, or solder sealing. Other forms of\n\nwelding offer assembly temperatures which would be too high for\n\nthe switching unit and could result in component damage. Cata\xc2\xad\nlog sources for enclosures were consulted (Zero Manufacturing,\n\nHudson Tool and Die, and Moorlee).\nIt appeared that a weldable\n\nenclosure, which was already tooled, was unavailable.\n\n\nE\nKINETICS\n\nITELEMD\n\nPage 3\n\nContact was made with Solar, Division of International Harvester\n\nCompany, concerning electron beam welding.\nIt was felt that the\n\nnickel plated header material would be weldable and that the\n\nhousing need only be changed from aluminum to stainless steel\n\nto afford a welded header to housing assembly. Since screws must\n\nbe soldered to the housing and purge fittings also soldered to\n\nthe housing, a nickel plating must be utilized here, too.\n\nHeader to Housing Welding\n\nIn consultation at Solar, with our assembly configuration, it\n\nwas seen that the switch housing could be electron beam welded\n\nto the header. Header materials were selected by the header\n\nvendor and will be 304 stainless for the 1241-1 type switch\n\nand AISI 1018 cold rolled steel for the 1242-1 type switch,\n\nThese headers will be watts nickel plated to afford solderability\n\nto the assembly screw heads.\n\nA major problem was the availability of housings; however, it\n\nwas pointed out that housings could be built up of tubing or\n\nfrom rolled sheet and then brazed to make an assembly. The\n\nmaterial would have to be of stainless for weld capability and\n\nwould also have to be watts nickel plated for solderability.\n\nThe possibility of using a material whose surface is solderable\n\nand is also weldable was an unforeseen advantage in the design\n\ndevelopment of the headers for these switches.\n\nIn the case of a welded cold rolled steel header, a corrosion\n\nresistant finish must be applied to the weld bead to prevent\n\nrusting. This treatment is an unknown at this time.\n\nA particularly vexing problem in the case of a welded header is\n\nthe fixturing necessary to weld a bead on the square housing.\n\nThere is no readily available fixture and would, therefore,\n\nrequire design and tooling to overcome this difficulty. On\n\ninspection of the header to housing weld, it appears deceptively\n\nsimple as a tooling problem. Further thought shows what a subtle\n\nproblem it really is.\nSimple tooling to accomplish the task does\n\nnot appear feasible and a method of accomplishing it has not been\n\nworked out, although a gear type concept has been conceived.\n\nDue to the press of schedule, it is felt that welding is not\n\nfeasible at this time and perhaps for this switch configuration,\n\nsince soldering must be employed for screw heads and for purge\n\nfittings.\n\n\n-WTELEDYNE\n\niNETFICS\n\nPage 4\n\nDESIGN\n\nDue to schedule limitations it was felt that welding would be\nout of the question. Since soldering was to be employed for\nsealing screw heads and purge fittings, it was felt that a\n\nsolder sealed housing would offer a readily producible seal\n\nand would be compatible to soldering operations anticipated.\n\nHeaders for both switches were designed utilizing integral\n\nterminals so no assembly of terminal to header was required.\n\nSwitch internal part changes were limited to sub-header and\n\ncontact configuration changes to allow assembly to the header.\n\nThe basic switch actuator and other sub-assembly parts were\n\nunchanged. Housings were modified in order to be compatible\n\nwith the new header design. Since deep drawn housings, as\n\npurchased, contained wide dimensional variation, it was necess\xc2\xad\nary to size the housing entry so that proper clearance for a\n\nsolder seal could be obtained. The housings were tin plated\n\n(fused) for solderability. Additionally, a strip of material\n\nwas machined all around the inside of the housing to act as a\n\nsolder barrier during the solder operation. This strip exposed\n\nbare aluminum and would not wet with solder; thereby acting as\n\na barrier against excess solder being pulled into the housing.\n\nScrews were stripped of cadium plating and were tin plated\n\n(fused) for solderability. The vendor selected for header\n\nmanufacture was also to be utilized for induction soldering.\n\n\n-\'rTELEDYNE\n\nIMJETICS\n\nPage\n\n5\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\n\nThe headers were redesigned on both switches to provide a\n\nglass or ceramic feed-thru for each of the terminals. In\n\nlight of the goal of maintaining the configuration as closely\n\nas possible, and in view of the schedule requirements, it was\n\ndecided that a solder seal would require thd least change in\n\nexisting configuration. A welded seal would have required a\n\nsteel housing and a change in header-to-housing interface\n\naffecting the envelope of the end item.\n\nHeader feed-thru design and development was subcontracted to\n\nPhysical Sciences. Competitive bids were obtained for feed\n\nthru design and we received only two responsible responses\n\nto this request for quote. Based on prior past experience\n\nworking with Physical Sciences, and their close proximity to\n\nour facility, they were selected.\n\n1241\n\nThe header is 304 stainless steel and the insulating material\n\nis a proprietary Physical Sciences material, under the trade\n\nname Durock 204.\nThe original design for the 75 ampere studs\n\nwas to braze an Inconel X750 sleeve over beryllium copper\n\nstud- The beryllium copper was plated with Watts nickel.\n\nSeveral attempts at different combinations of brazing temper\xc2\xad\nature, plating processes, and fits between the sleeve and the\n\nstud were unsuccessful. The braze would not uniformly wet\n\nbetween the faying surfaces. The design was changed to the\n\nconfiguration tested, which is an Inconel sleeve flanged on\n\nthe top side of the header to mate with a corresponding flange\n\non the stud. The seal between the sleeve and stud is accom\xc2\xad\nplished by a peripheral weld around the flange using electron\n\nbeam welding technique.\n\nDue to an oversight on the part of\n\n\nPhysical Sciences, the small studs were unnecessarily designed\n\nto the same configuration as the large studs. The stud mater\xc2\xad\nial, for compatibility with the weld to Inconel, was changed\n\nto OFHC copper.\nThe procurement drawing required that the\n\n1/4 inch stud meet an 80 inch/pound torque, and the number six\n\nstud meet a 12 inch/pound torque. Dielectric testing of the\n\nfirst header resulted in a breakdown, from the 1/4 inch stud\n\nto the header, of 1600 VAC which was attributed to a combin\xc2\xad\nation of the width of the air gap, a sharp point or protrusion\n\non the periphery of the flange, and the humidity. Since the\n\nspecification requirement is 1,000 VAC, the criteria for the\n\nheader was reduced to 1,500.\n\n\nTELEDYNE\nKMNETICS\n\nPage 6\n\n1242\n\nThe header is C018 cold drawn carbon steel and the contacts\n\nare made of Alloy 52, copper cored 446 stainless. The insul\xc2\xad\nating media is potash-soda batium glass. No problems were\n\nexperienced manufacturing this header.\n\nThe headers for both switches are integrated assemblies with\n\nthe insulating material fused directly to the structural\n\nheader. Both headers have a Watts nickel jliting, ALMS 2403F.\n\nThe 1241 header has a tin fused plating, MIL-T-1027 Type I\n\nfused, on top of the Watts nickel. The difference in finish\non the two headers permits evaluation, in this development\nprogram, of these two finishes in a solder seal. Solder seal\nrequires a closer fit between the sealing surfaces than that\nused on the prior designs of the M936 and M938. To accomplish\nthis fit, the deep drawn canswere swedged to a fit tolerance.\n-\n\nIn the design phase, concern for penetration of flux and\n\nsolder to the interior of the switch caused an investigation\n\ninto a barrier that would be effective, yet producible. The\n\ntechnique employed was to remove the plating finish on the\n\ninterior of the can 0.2 inches down from the lip, in a strip\n\n.03 inches wide. This exposed bare aluminum on the interior\n\nThe\n\nof the switch which is protected from the environments.\nbare aluminum will not wetT the solder, and acts as a barrier.\n\nIn the interest of keeping the temperature exposure of the\n\nswitch mechanism to a minimum, the method of soldering used\n\nwas induction heating. The screws in the header and the can\n\non the 1242 were sealed with a flat soldering iron. The screws\n\nwere stripped and tin fuse plated for soldering. On the 1241,\n\nthe screws in the header were induction soldered immediately\n\nprior to soldering the can to the header. This technique\n\nproved far superior, providing a more uniform solder fillet.\n\nThe screws thru the can on the 1241 were sealed with a circu\xc2\xad\nlar iron that was induction heated.\n\nThe 1241 was sealed with a 60-40 cored solder, SN60WRAP3. The\n\nuse of cored solder in the induction sealing process results in\n\nthe solder flowing ahead of the flux at least during the initial\n\nwetting action. It would appear that cored solder is not the\n\nmost desireable material to use with induction heating. The\n\n1242 was sealed using a coreless 60-40 solder bushing on a\n\nrosin flux 3ust prior to applying heat.\n\n\nW\' TELEDYNE\n-\n\nINEICS\n\nPage 7\n\n\nTESTING\n\nNo failures were experienced during any of the environmental\n\ntests- The only failures experienced were during the torque\n\ntest and during post-vibration dielectric tests.\n\nDuring torque and terminal strength testing of the 1241, the\n\n1/4 inch terminal stud exhibited evidence of yielding\'at\n\napproximately 50 inch/pounds. Testing was inlediately stopped.\n\nA minor yield of the terminal akially was observed. This yield\n\nwas caused by the screw jack action of the nut reacting against\n\nthe washers and then the flanges of the stud. It was decided\n\nto move this test to the end of the test program since a\n\nfracture of the stud would have resulted in a\'leak, and would\n\nhave terminated the test program at this point.\n\nFollowing overload testing, the terminals were tested for\n\ntorque and were found to be quite soft. A cap nut was installed\n\non the stud which had not been stressed, and torque was applied\n\nto 40 inch/pounds before the stud yielded. Bottoming the cap\n\nnut on the end of the stud permitted application of a radial\n\ntorque with no axial loads. The yielding took place at the\n\nminor diameter of the thread. No yielding was observed at\n\nthe flange. The maximum torque that can be applied to the\n\n1/4 inch studs without damage is 35 inch/pounds. A speciali\n\nfixture was made to apply the torque to the periphery of the\n\nstud flange. Torque applied at this point on both studs met\n\nthe 80 inch/pound requirement with no damage to the Durock.\n\nThe number six studs torqued with a cap nut, yielded at 5 inch/\n\npounds. A special fixture applying torque to the periphery\n\nof the stud flange on two studs, met the 12 inch/pound require\xc2\xad\nment with no damage to the Durock material. The maximum torque\n\nthat can be applied to the number six stud without damage is\n\n4 inch/pounds.\n\nThe 1241 terminal 13 high potted to case during the post-vib\xc2\xad\nration functional test. The breakdown occurred at 600 VAC.\n\nIt was decided to complete testing since this circuit is not\n\nused in the overload tests. Following the final seal test,\n\nthe dielectric breakdown was still in evidence. No sign of a\n\nleakage path was visually discernable under an 18 times micro\xc2\xad\nscope.\n\nHowever, two small cracks are evident, extending\n\n\ntangentially from the stud, .020 inch in one case and .040 in\n\nthe other. The cracks appeared to be limited to the meniscus\n\nof the insulator.\n\n-TELEYE\nKINETICS\n\nThe portion of the header immediately\n\n\nPage 8\n\nsurrounding this contact was removed from the switch. Visual\n\nexamination of the under side of the terminal stud and the\n\nmating portion of the header and contact pin, revealed no\n\ncause of the breakdown. Subsequent to removal of the fiber\xc2\xad\nglass pin board section from the terminal stud, the high pot\n\nwas lost. Cause of the dielectric breakdown was not determined.\n\nDuring overload testing on the 1241, the power supply was cali\xc2\xad\nbrated to a load of 1540 amps. The switch was then inserted\n\ninto the test circuit and current was monitored with a hot wire\n\nrecorder. Six cycles were performed on the switch. Recorded\n\ncurrent showed that 1350 to 1400 amps were being made and inter\xc2\xad\nrupted by the switch, instead-of 1500 as required. In evalu\xc2\xad\nating time \'ON" to time "OFF" periods for this overload testing,\n\nit is seen that the equivalent heating effect of this lower\n\ncurrent is nearly that of a 1590 amp overload operating at one\nsecond "ON, 19 seconds "OFF", since the "ON" time was the order\nof 1.2 seconds in three instances. Teledyne Kinetics added the\noverload test to test the Durock material for exposure to the\n\nthermal rise characteristics of this size load.\n\n\n1-WTELEDYNE\nKINETICS\n\nPage 9\n\nPOST TEST TEARDOWN ANALYSIS\n\nAfter development testing was completed, the switches were\n\nopened by removing the entire center portion of the housing.\n\nExamination of the switch interior showed the following\n\ncharacteristics.\n\n1242-1\n\nSolder flux was present at the seal joint at the header. The\n\nsolder joint appeared fully wetted along the lap joint. The\n\nsolder barrier, which had been machined into the housing,\n\nappeared-to have no function during the solder operation,and\n\ncan probably be deleted. The insulated segment of the control\n\ndisc was seen to contain two depressions where the contacts\n\nhad formed a permanent deformation. This was probably caused\n\nby material cold flow during the high temperature testing\n\nportion of the testing program. Since later designs have\n\ndeleted this epoxy segment, it is recommended that this change\n\nbe incorporated on this switch also. No flux could be detected\n\nin the interior of the housing, except for a small amount in\n\nthe fillet between the housing and the lap joint where flux\n\ncould be expected to be found.\n\n1241-1\n\nThe 1241 switch was opened and the internal parts examined\'for\n\ndefects or damage. The solder joint appeared to have somewhat\n\nmore voids than on the 1242-1 switch. This is attributed to\n\nthe cored solder.that was used in sealing the header to housing.\n\nIncomplete wetting occurred in some areas, since the flux was\n\n\nnot flowing ahead of the solder but was contained within the\n\nsolder preform. The barrier did not come into use during the\n\nsoldering operation since the solder was confined as a fillet\n\nin the lap joint area. The epoxy segment on this switch also\n\nshowed permanent depressions from the contacts. As before, it\n\nis recommended that the epoxy segment be deleted. Flux was\n\nonly to be found in the area of the solder fillet below the\n\nheader. Some black sooty arc deposits were to be seen in the\n\narea of the high current contacts. This was to be expected,\n\n-due to breaking 1350 amperes during the overload portion of the\n\ntest program.\n\n\n\'WTELEDYNE\nKINETICS\n\nPage 10\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe study program has been successful. The ability to fusion\n\nseal these switch configurations within their prior design\n\nenvelopes has been demonstrated.\n\nThe following recommended changes should be incorporated in\n\nsubsequent units of these configurations.\n\nA. \t Solder sealing of screws and housing to header should\n\nbe accomplished by induction heating only. Solid core\n\nsolder and a brush on, sparingly applied,rosin flux\n\nshould be utilized.\n\nB. \t For solderability, both headers should be tin fuse\n\nplated over the Watts nickel plating.\n\nC. \t The studs in the 1241 header will be of a stronger\n\nalloy, such as molybdenum. Also, the flange will be\n\ndesigned to withstand the axial force introduced by\n\nthe screw 3ack action of the nut. The smaller studs\n\nwill be made of a steel alloy directly fusible to the\n\nDurock, or will simply be made of a stronger material\n\nin the present configuration.\n\nD. \t The machined barrier strip around the inside of the\n\nhousing can be deleted since it performed no function\n\nin solder sealing either switch. The solder remained\n\nas a fillet in the area of the lap joint, which was an\n\nunexpected advantage seen in solder sealing these\n\nswitches.\n\nE. \t Any further configuration changes for these switches\n\nshould incorporate the latest state-of-the-art; such\n\nas, a motor control disc in which the epoxy segment\n\nis deleted and the Teledyne Kinetics motor.\n\n\nWTELEDYNE\nKINETICS\n\nPage 11\n\n\nADMINISTRATIVE DATA\n\n\nPURPOSE OF TEST\n\nThe purpose of this document is to define the procedures used\n\nand data obtained during development testing of switch 1241-1\n\nand switch 1242-1.\n\n\nMANUFACTURER\n\nTeledyne Kinetics\n\n410 South Cedros Avenue\n\nSolana Beach, California\n\n92075\n\n\nPART NUMBER AND DESCRIPTION\n\n\nOne (1) each switch types were submitted for test.\nidentified as follows:\n\nDescription\nSwitch\nSwitch\n\nTeledyne Kinetics P/N\n1241-1\n1242-1\n\nThey are\n\n\nSerial\'No.\n\n0001\n\n0001\n\n\nAPPLICABLE DOCUMENTS\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n\nTeledyne Kinetics\nTeledyne Kinetics\nTeledyne Kinetics\nTeledyne Kinetics\nMIL-STD-202\n\nNASA Contract NAS\nTeledyne Kinetics\n\nWITELEDYNE\nINETIOS\n\ndrawing\ndrawing\ndrawing\ndrawing\n\n1241,\n1242,\nM938,\nM936,\n\nRev.

This testing was discontinued and it was decided to\n\nperform this test at the conclusion of all other testing.\n\nThis testing and analysis has been included as an addendum\n\nto this report.\n\n2. \t Leak rate values at CEL measured higher than values recorded\n\nat Teledyne Kinetics. Since these values were of the proper\n\norder of magnitude, even though higher than 1 x 10 - 7 scc/sec,\n\ntesting was continued and Teledyne Kinetics leak test values\n\nwere relied upon for accuracy. CEL leak rate values were\n\nuseful for comparison of leak rates before and after shock\n\ntesting.\n\n3. \tOverload testing at 1500 amps was set up and adjusted to\n\nabout 1540 amps at 27.2 VDC without the switch installed.\n\nThe switch was installed and one cycle was performed upon\n\nwhich a recording instrument appeared to fail. The test\n\nwas discontinued and the malfunction traced to smoke rising\n\nfrom the hot-wire recorder, which is a normal situation.\n\nSix cycles were then performed per the test requirement\n\nand the testing was discontinued.\' Upon inspection of the\n\ntest recording, it was seen that the switch only made a\n\n1400 amp inrush current, which dropped to 1350 amps before\n\ninterruption. Three cycles of current showed an "ON" time\n\nof 1.2 seconds,which on an 12t basis at 1350 amps is about\n\n95% of the heating developed for 1500 amps at 1 sec. on.\n\nOn this basis the heat rise was roughly equivalent to the\n\nspecified values,although the actual current value at\n\ninterruption was lower than 1500 amps.\n\n4. \t Following overload testing, a dielectric strength breakdown\n\nat about 600 VRIMS was experienced on terminal 13 of the\n\nsignal circuit. At teardown inspection, the breakdown was\n\nduplicated. The offending terminal and mating pieces were\n\n\nVTELPEDYNE \t\nKINEICS\n\nPLge 14\n\ncut from the assembly for analysis. Two cracks in the\n\nsurface of the ceramic could be seen with the aid of a\n\nstereo-microscope. Upon separation of the terminal from\n\nthe mating piece, the breakdown path disappeared or was\n\ndestroyed in disassembly since the breakdown could not be\n\nduplicated. No explanation for the breakdown can be deter\xc2\xad\nmined from analysis. It is felt that breakdown was probably\n\ndue to a conductive particle lodged on the insulator surface,\n\nsince the condition was not permanent.\n\n\nITELEDYNE\nKINETICS\n\nPage 15\n\n1.0\n\nTEST REQUIREMENTS\n\nEach test switch was sub3ected to the following schedule\n\nof tests performed in the sequence shown.\n\n\nTest\nAcceptance Test Plan\nTerminal Strength\nSeal\nOperating Temperature\nSeal\nTemperature Cycling\nSeal\nShock\nSeal\nVibration\nAcceptance Test Plan\nOverload\nSeal\nTerminal Strength\n2.0\n\n-\n\n*\n\nTOLERANCES\n\n\n2.1\n\n1241-1 switch\n1242-1 switch\n\nPara DTP 1241\nPara DTP 1242\nDATP 1241\nDATP 1242\n*3.2.5 pullonly\n3.2.5\n3.2.2\n3.2.2\n3.2.6\n3.2.6\n3.2.2\n3.2.2\n3.2.7\n3.2.7\n3;2.2\n3-2.2\n3.2.9\n3.2.9\n3.2.2\n3.2.2\n3.2.8\n3.2.8\n** DATP 1241\nDATP 1242\n3.2.10\n3.2.2\n\nStandard conditions\n\nUnless otherwise specified herein, testing was conducted\n\nin the following environments.\n\nTemperature\n+25 \xc2\xb1 15 0 C (+75 \xc2\xb1 250 F)\n\nRelative Humidity\n35 to 55 percent\n\nBarometric Pressure\n30 \xc2\xb1 2 in.

Measurements\n\nperformed were seal test, operating voltages, timing,\n\nmotor \t\ncurrent, voltage drop, dielectric strength, and\n\ninsulation resistance.\n\nMeasured values were in accordance with the DATP require\xc2\xad\nments.\n\n3.2 \t Terminal Strength\n\nThe 1242-1 switch solder terminals were subjected to\n\na pull force of ten pounds at 450 from the normal axis\n\nfor 15 to 30 seconds. Force was applied at the top of\n\nthe solder loop. There was no evidence of insulator\n\ndamage or terminal damage.\n\nThe 1241-1 switch stud terminals were subjected to a\n\npull force of fifty pounds on the 1/4-28 terminals and\n\na pull force of thirty pounds on the 6-32 terminals.\n\nThere was no evidence of terminal or insulator damage.\n\n1/4-28 studs were then subjected to torque testing in\n\nwhich \tielding was seen to occur at about fifty inch\n\ny\npounds torque. Investigation of stud materials and\n\nconstruction indicated that the studs would not meet\n\nspecified torques; however, the switch would not be\n\nhampered in meeting the remaining environmental test\n\nrequirements due to this condition. Therefore, torque\n\ntesting was terminated and placed at the end of testing\n\nin the teardown analysis phase of this program.\n\n3.3 \t Post terminal strength leak testing was performed on\n\nboth switches. Mass spectrometer and gross leak testing\n\nshowed bbth switches within required leak rates.\n\n3.4 \t High Temperature Testing\n\nBoth switches were placed in a temperature chamber in\n\nwhich \t\ntemperature was 160 0 F. Contacts were energized\n\nwith rated inputs and voltage drop was monitored through\xc2\xad\nout the four (4) hour period. Transfer time and peak\n\n\n5?TELEDYNE\nKINETIS\n\nPage 18\n\nmotor current were recorded during the last cycle of\n\nactuation. Both switches performed within DATP require\xc2\xad\nments and no evidence of deterioration or out-of-spec\n\nperformance was noted.\n\n3.5\n\nnigh Temperature (Re-entry)\n\nThe switches were subjected to a 2000F ambient temperature\n\nfor fifteen minutes. The switches were cycled five times\n\nduring the last five minutes of exposure and actuator\n\ncurrent and transfer time were measured and recorded. Both\n\nswitches met requirements and no evidence of malfunction\n\nor physical deterioration was noted.\n\n\n3.6\n\nPost High Temperature (Re-entry)\n\nPost high temperature (re-entry) leak testing was performed.\n\nMass spectrometer and gross leak testing showed both\n\nswitches to be within specified leakage rates.\n\n\n3.7\n\nLow Temperature Testinq\n\nBoth switches were placed in a temperature chamber in\n\nContacts were energized\n\nwhich temperature was -650F.\nwith rated inputs and voltage drop was monitored through\xc2\xad\nout the four (4) hour period. Transfer time and peak\n\nmotor current were recorded during the last cycle of\n\nactuation. Both switches performed within requirements\n\nand no evidence of deteriorations or out-of-spec perform\xc2\xad\nance was noted.\n\n\n3.8\n\nPost Low Temperature\n\nPost low temperature leak testing was performed. Mass\n\nspectrometer and gross leak testing showed both switches\n\nto be within specified leakage rates.\n\n\n3.9\n\nTemperature Cycling\n\nBoth switches were subjected to temperature cycling in\n\nwhich two temperature chambers were utilized. Testing\n\nwas performed per MIL-STD-202, method 102, test condition\n\nOne chamber\n\nD; except high temperature was 950 C (+2000F).\nwas set at -55 0 C (-670F) and the other chamber was set at\n\n95 0 C (+2000F). Switches were alternately cycled from the\n\ncold chamber, to the hot chamber with a short time spent\n\n\n5OTELEDYNE\nKINETICS\n\nPage 19\n\nat \t\nrbomarnbient between each temperature extreme. This\n\ntemperature cycling was continued for five cycles. Upon\n\ncompletion of testing, no damage or deterioration was\n\nnoted.\n\n3.10\n\nPost Temperature cycling\n\nPost temperature cycling seal testing was performed on\n\nboth switches. Mass spectrometer and gross leak testing\n\nshowed both switches to be within specified leak rates.\n\n\n3.11\n\nPre-Shock Test Leak\n\nPre-shock test leak testing was performed at CEL to\n\nestablish a reference leak rate on their equipment.\n\nThe 1241-1 showed a leak rate of 1.36x10- 7 scc/sec and\n\nthe 1242-1 showed a leak rate of 4.30x10- 7 scc/sec on\n\ntheir mass spectrometer. These leak rates were greater\n\nthan 1 x 10- 7 scc/sec as specified; but were of the\n\nproper order of magnitude. It was decided to continue\n\ntesting and to use these values as a reference for\n\npost shock leak testing.\n\n\n3.12\n\nShock Test\n\nThe switches, with wiring attached, were subjected to\n\nshock levels of 50 g for 11 milliseconds, two directions,\'\n\nin each of three axes for a total of six shocks. No\n\ndamage or deterioration was noted as a resuit of this\n\ntest.\n\n\n3.13\n\nPost Shock\n\nPost shock seal testing was performed at CEL on their\n\nequipment. The 1241-1 switch exhibited a leak rate of\n\n1.38xi0 - 7 scc/sec and the 1242-1 showed a leak rate of\n\n3.16xi0 - 7 scc/sec. As before, these values were in excess\n\nof \the specified 1 x 10- 7 scc/sec; but were in-agreement\n\nt\nwith the pre-shock leak test values, indicating that the\n\nseals were unaffected by shock testing.\n\n\n3.14\n\nVibration Testinq\n\nSwitches were sub3ected to superimposed sinusoidal and\n\nrandom vibration. Sinusoidal vibration was to be 15 g\n\n\nW \tTELEDYNE\nKINETICS\n\nPage 20\n\n\npeak from 5 to 2000 CPS, limited to 0.4 inch D.A. Due\n\nto equipment limitation, the low end of the frequency\n\nspectrum below 20 CPS was not able to be maintained at\n\nthe proper level. Randdm vibration was 0.13 92 per Hz\n\nfrom 5 to 2000 Hz for an overall level of 16.7 GEMS.\n\nVibration was conducted in each of three axis for ten\n\nminutes per axis (five minutes in each switch position).\n\nThe switch wiring was attached and supported during the\n\ntest. No deterioration or damage was noted at the\n\nconclusion of testing.\n\n3.15\n\nPost Vibration Testing\n\nPost vibration testing consisted of DATP testing of seal,\n\noperating voltage, timing, motor burrent, voltage drop,\n\ndielectric strength and insulation resistance. The\n\nswitches passed all testing except that the 1241-1 switch\n\nexhibited dielectric failure at 600 VRMS 60 Hz on circuit\n\n13. With the aid of a stereo-microscope, two small\n\ncracks were noted in the surface of the ceramic, extending\n\noutward from the central conductor. Since this defect\n\nwould not affect the remaining overcurrent test on this\n\nswitch, it was felt that analysis of this hypot failure\n\ncould be deferred for failure analysis during the teardown\n\ninspection of the switch.\n\n\n3.16\n\nOverload Testing\n\n(1241-1 Switch Only)\n\n\nOverload testing was conducted on this switch making\n\n1400 amps and breaking 1350 amps for a period of one\n\nsecond "ON" nineteen seconds "OFF", for six cycles.\n\nStud temperature was monitored dtiring this test by\n\nutilizing a thermocouple mounted between the hardware\n\nretaining nut and a jam nut. Temperature excursion after\n\nthe first pulse was 41\'F rising from 93 0 F to 134 0 F.\n\nTemperature rise after the last pulse was an excursion\n\nof 8 0 F rising from 194 0 F to 202 0 F.\n\n3.17\n\nPost Overload Testing\n\nPost overload seal testing was performed on the 1241-1\n\nswitch. The switch passed both mass spectrometer and gross\n\nleak test within specified values.\n\n\n5\'"TELEDYNE\nKINETICS\n\nPage 21\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nTERMINAL STRENGTH TESTING AND ANALYSIS\n\n\nAt the conclusion of all other testing, terminals were sub3ected\n\nto torque testing. The 1/4-28 terminal was tested to destruction\n\nby tightening a nut against the hardw.are. Failure of the ter\xc2\xad\nminal seat was experienced at 40 inch/pounds. The nut was\n\ntightened to complete failure. The stud seat will require a\n\nthicker section to prevent the diaphragm effect, which leads to\n\ndestruction of the seat. Actual thickness to be chosen will,\n\nin turn, depend upon the ultimate choice of stud material.\n\nIncreasing the stud seat thickness will cause the switch height\n\nto increase by the amount of seat thickness.\n\nThe remaining 1/4-28 stud terminal was torqued, using a cap nut,\n\nso that pure torque could be applied to the stud. The stud\n\nyielded at the minor diameter of the thread at 40 inch/pou-nds.\n\nSince the actual ceramic-metal seal interface had not been\n\ntorqued to specification values, a special fixture was mad6 so\n\nthat the stud seat could be torqued and, therefore, apply torque\n\nto the actual seal. The 1/4-28 stud seals were subjected to\n\n100 inch/pounds, at which point they failed. One seal gave way\n\nin about five seconds at 100 inch/pounds; the other seal gave way\n\nin about ten seconds under this torqce. The failure appeared\n\nbetween the center conductor and ceramic interface where the\n\nceramic generally failed by localized shattering at the shear\n\ninterface.\n\nThe 6-32 studs were torqued with the nut against the hardware.\n\nJack screw action of the nut caused the stud to fail in tenslon\n\nat five inch/pounds torque applied to the nut. A cap nut was\n\ninstalled so that pure torque could be applied to the terminal.\n\nAt five inch/pounds, the terminal proceeded to fail at the minor\n\nthread diameter. A torque fixture was made, which gripped the\n\nterminal seat at it\'s periphery. In this way, pure torque was\n\napplied to the ceramic seal. The ceramic was torqued to 20 inch/\n\npounds, at which point failure occurred.\n\n\nR\'-TELEDYNE\nKINETICS\n\nPage 22\n\nFrom this testing, it appears that the ceramic-metal seal will\n\nwithstand torques in excess of that specified; but stud material\n\nmust be changed to a stronger material of high conductivity in\n\norder to fulfill original specification requirements. Since\n\ncopper and copper alloys would all be subject to softening at\n\nthe ceramic fusion temperature, a different basic material is\n\nneeded. From discussion with American Metal Climax Company, it\n\nappears that molybdenum is a good choice for strength, conduc\xc2\xad\ntivity, and heat resistance characteristics. It is readily\n\nweldable and is machineable for our purposes. Special care will\n\nneed to be taken to provide an inert atmosphere during the\n\nceramic fusing process, so that oxidation of molybdenum will not\n\noccur. This is not an insurmountable problem and should be\n\nreadily accomplished. In discussing with the header manufacturer\n\nthe use of molybdenum for studs, there appears to be no produci\xc2\xad\nbility problems and this recommended change can be incorporated\n\neasily.\n\nBasic changes will be to specify molybdenum for terminal studs\n\nand to provide greater stud seat thickness on the 1/4-28\n\nterminals.\n\n\n"\'0TELEDYNE\nKINETICS\n\nPage 23\n\nSDZVz/7PAIt,! iIT TEST\n\nJ2 41\n\nEQUIPMENT LIST\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND MODEL NUMBER\n\n1211?,\n\n-c-\n\n/\n\n?ZVsf\n\n/\n\n/AIN\n\'\n\n..\n\notC/\n\n-/pe\n/cc\' \n\n\n~\n\n0\n\nJ3/O7\n"~\n\nATELla\n\n\'~?"TEEEHNFPage\n*\n\nKNETIS\n\n-,,2ZL-\n\n,\n\n/~t j\'/r7/\n67\nleet e j-4\n\n./-Cr4 / - C2,5-c,\n\nSER.
