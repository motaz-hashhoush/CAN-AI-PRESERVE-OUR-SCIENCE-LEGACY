b'MILITARY NEEDS FOR ORBITAL POWER\nL. D. Massie, R. R. Bartheleqy and E. T. Mahefkey\nAir Force Aero Propulsion Laboratory\nWright-Patterson AFB\n\nSUMMARY\nResults of the DOD/ERDA (now Department of Energy) Space Power Study\ncompleted in October 1977 show a trend toward higher power levels for\nfuture DOD space missions. Consequently, the major new thrusts of Air Force\nAdvanced Technology Plans center on the development of military solar power\nsystems which will extend capabilities to the 10-50 KWe power range for new\nclasses of missions while maintaining technology applicability to the .5\nto 10 Wepresent mission class. Plans call for technology level, subsystems level, and integrated power system level efforts. These efforts\nwill emphasize performance, reliability, autonomy and survivability.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe objective of the Air Force Space Power Advanced Development Program\n(Project 6825) is to develop and demonstrate space power system technology\nto meet increasing power needs of Air Force Satellites in the post-1978 time\nperiod.\nPast 6825 efforts which have successfully transitioned to operational\napplications include the Flexible Rolled-up Solar Array (FRUSA), Hardened\nArray Solar Power System (HASPS), and the 2 KWe Long Life Battery (LLB).\nThe 1.5 KWe FRUSA was successfully flown on Space Test Program Vehicle 71-2.\nThe HASPS has been selected for meeting the 7.3 KWe prime power requirement\nof the SIRE (Space Infrared Experiment) ~80-2\nmission. The 2 WeLLB effort\nprovided the baseline technology from which the 14.3 watt- hrs/Kg\n(6.5 watt hrs/Lb) FLTSATCOM battery evolved.\nThe present FY78 efforts in Project 682J include the multiple phase\nTask 682504 High Efficiency Solar Panel (HESP), Task 682505 Nickel-Hydrogen\nGallium Arsenide Solar\nBattery (Ni/H2), a recently completed Task 682~06\nConcentrator Hardness Study (Concentrator) and a February 1978 Task 682507\nnew-start Nuclear Dynamic Power System Applications/Integration Study.\nIn view of findings and conclusions of the DOD/ERDA Space Power Study\nReport, the Technology Program Plan for Space Power Advanced Development\nwas recently modified to address the projected trend toward higher power\nlevels and an enhanced threat environment for military satellites. The new\nplanning initiatives include a Task 682508 High Voltage High Power (HVHP)\n\n93\n\nSystem; Task 682509 High Energy Density Rechargeable Battery (HEDRB); Task\n682~10\nFault Tolerant Power System (FTPS); Task 682~11\nThermal Energy\nStorage Subsystem (TESS) and Task 682512 Cascaded Solar Cell Development\nProgram.\nSTATUS OF PRESENT EFFORTS\nTask 682J04.- HESP Phase I has been completed with the demonstration of\nsilicon solar cells having efficiencies of 14 percent. HESP Phase I1 has\nbeen initiated with the objective of demonstrating 16 percent efficient\nsilicon cells and improved experimental quantities of 16 percent efficient\ngallium arsenide cells. Under HESP Phase 11, recent silicon and radiationhardened gallium arsenide developmental cells delivered to AFAPL have\ndemonstrated efficiencies as high as 15.5 and 17 percent respectively.\nRadiation resistance of gallium arsenide cells has been improved to the point\nwhere some cells are superior to high output silicon cells at 1-MeV electron\nfluence levels as high as 5 x 1015 e/cm2 as shown in Figure 1. As shown in\nFigure 2, temperature coefficients of gallium arsenide cells are clearly\nsuperior to those of silicon, making gallium arsenide cells attractive for\nConcentrating Photovoltaic Power System Concepts. Gallium arsenide cells\nhave favorable vslues of solar absorptance ( a = .78) as compared to silicon\n( a = .85, smooth surface cells; a = .94, textured surface cells). Both HESP\ntextured silicon cells and gallium arsenide cells being flown as experiments\non the NTS-I1 (Navigation Technology Satellite) are performing well after\nmore than 223 days in orbit. Both cell types are to be included in the\nforthcoming DIABLO HAWK underground nuclear test.\nTask 682505,- In the area of rechargeable batteries, Ni/H2 cell design\nhas been completed and the initial group of twenty-six (26) test cells\nare being manufactured for evaluation. In addition NASA Marshall Space\nFlight Center has provided funds for two Ni/H2 cells for independent test\nand evaluation. Twenty-four (24) cells will be built in the spring of 1978\nfor an Industry Dispersal Program under which independent industry tests\nwill be conducted. The Naval Research Laboratory has expressed interest in\nutilizing the Air Force developed Ni/H2 cells on NTS-I11 scheduled for\nlaunch in 1981. Negotiation of a Memorandum of Agreement between the Air\nForce and Navy pertaining to the NTS-I11 cells is anticipated during the\nsecond quarter of 1978. It is presently estimated that a total of fortyeight, 35-ampere-hour cells would be required for meeting NTS-I11 requirements. Sixteen of the forty-eight cells would be assembled into a high\nperformance battery, integrated, and utilized as the NTS-I11 energy storage\nsubsystem. A successful orbital test of early vintage Ni/H2 cells ha5\nalready been conducted on a SAMSO Special Projects Vehicle. The advanced\ndevelopment program Ni/H2 cells currently being fabricated are expected\nto be vastly superior to these early vintage cells already flown in space\nin terms of cycle life, depth of discharge and energy density, Figure 3\nis a schematic of the 50-ampere-hr Ni/H2 cell design. Figure 4 is a\nphotograph of the 21-cell Ni/H2 battery flown on the SAMSO/SP Vehicle. Table\nI is a preliminary weight breakdown for a 1.15-KW-Hr Ni/H;2 Battery based upon\n94\n\na Hughes Aircraft Company conceptual design.\nA\nTask 682~06.- gallium arsenide cell concentrating photovoltaic concept\nrecently studied under a Contract with Rockwell International is considered\nto be a promising technology option for advanced laser threat hardness. The\nconcept utilizes Cassegrainian optics in conjunction with a Winston collector\nto focus sunlight on a single high efficiency gallium arsenide cell at a concentration ratio of about 500\' to 1. Cell operating temperature is maintained\nat approximately 12OoC by an integral, distributed heat pipe radiator. The\nfinal study report (AFAPL-TR-78-30) pertaining to this concept will be\ndistributed in June 1978.\nTask 682~07.The recently initiated Nuclear Dynamic Power System Applications/Integration Study will provide the analysis, design, and spaceflight\nintegration considerations needed to assure a successful space demonstration\nof a 1.3-KWe radioisotope-fueled dynamic power system. An important part of\nthis study will deal with analyzing future special purpose Air Force missions\nwhich will benefit from this technology. In addition, the program will\nprovide for (a) analysis of requirements for integration and orbital\noperations, (b) evaluation of nuclear and laser hardness, and (c) develop\npreparatory information needed for the assessment of safety and environmental\nimpacts. The overall program is to assure Air Force a2plicability of the DOE\nNuclear Dynamic Power System Technology.\nFUTURE PLANS\n\n-\n\nAPPROVED PROGRAM\n\nFuture space power advanced development plans, within the approved\nprogram, are primarily extensions of present efforts and include the following: (a) Gallium Arsenide Solar Panel work which is directed toward panel\ndesign, fabrication and spaceflight qualification; (b) HESP Phases I11 and I\nV\nwhich are for advanced cell production demonstration, flight experiment\ndesign, experiment spaceflight qualification and orbital. flight test; (c)\ncompletion of single-cell Ni/H2 efforts through orbital flight test and\nimplementation of a Common Pressure Vessel Ni/H2 program; (d) implementation\nof a Concentrating Photovoltaic Power System hardware build and evaluation\neffort; and (e) completion of the Nuclear Power Supply Study in support of\nspace payload AFAPL 601 - Nuclear Dynamic Power System Flight Experiment.\nFigure 5 is a Milestone Chart which encompasses present efforts and\nfuture plans within the approved program. The chart shows anticipated\ntechnology advances and when they are expected to occur, based upon present\nbudget allocations. For example, 16 percent efficient space-qualified s o l a r\ncell assemblies are.expected in 1980. Demonstration of advanced solar cells\nthrough a 20,000-cell flight test is expected by 1983. Conclusive demonstration of single-cell Ni/H2 batteries through flight test on NTS-3 should\noccur in 1981. Flight test of a Ihclear Dynamic Power System is scheduled\nfor 1983.\n\n95\n\nO v e r a l l results of t h e s e e f f o r t s , compared t o c o n v e n t i o n a l technology,\nw i l l double t h e e n d - o f - l i f e power p e r u n i t area o f s o l a r a r r a y s , more t h a n\ndouble t h e u s e a b l e energy d e n s i t y o f s p a c e c r a f t energy s t o r a g e subsystems,\nand make new power technology o p t i o n s such as C o n c e n t r a t i n g P h o t o v o l t a i c\nand Nuclear Dynamic Power Systems a v a i l a b l e f o r s p e c i a l purpose DOD\nsatellite applications.\n\nO E T D\nRESULTS O DOD/ERDA SPACE P W R S U Y\nF\n\nA DOD/ERDA Space Power Study w a s conducted d u r i n g t h e p e r i o d from\na\nFebruary 1976 t o M y 1977.

The trend toward military space power requirements in the 10 100 KWe\nrange is valid, based upon the probable needs for advanced surveillance,\nECM resistant communications, space-based radar, and space defense missions.\nb. Performance enhancements in s o l a r cell efficiency and battery energy\ndensity and lifetime are of major importance to spacecraft designers.\ne . Design to performance, survivability and reliability/autonomy\nmandates are important military satellite power system requirements.\n\nd. Advanced solar arrays and batteries will continue to be the predominant\npower system choice for future Air Force satellites in the foreseeable\nfuture. Nuclear power system options should be maintained for specialized\nmissions requiring very high levels of hardness and orbit predictability.\n\n98\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
