Field of view, duty cycle, speed of analysis, photon counting statistics, background, and data release policies differ markedly. The challenge for cooperative studies has been to make the best use of complementary properties. One example is GeV discovery and monitoring surveys for AGN coupled with rev time variability studies. Another is GeV spectral measurements for Galactic sources joined with reV spatial resolution. In many cases, sharing of information has been a positive factor, and continuing to explore ways to exchange results and ideas will help to maximize the scientific return from all gamma-ray observatories.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "India", "submissionId": 20120016009, "endDate": "2012-07-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) Scientific Assembly Meeting", "location": "Mysore", "id": "31cc6308db844852acab5036ff1f7f82", "startDate": "2012-07-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120016009, "id": "f75ea5b10c3544a18d2d588cea900bf9", "publicationDate": "2012-07-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120016009.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120016009/downloads/20120016009.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120016009/downloads/20120016009.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120016009/downloads/20120016009.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
