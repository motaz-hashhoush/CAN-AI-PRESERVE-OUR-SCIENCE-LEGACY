Power output, in watts\n(horsepower) , i s presented at the end of each discussion f o r comparison purposes. The space tools a r e divided into c l a s s e s by types of motion and usage.\nTo f u r t h e r investigate space tools, the tool assemblies were divided into t h r e e\nsections, the power source, the prime mover, and the attachments. Advanced\nelectric tools, because of power t o weight ratio and safety, a r e deemed s u p e r i o r\nto other tool concepts discussed.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe object of this report is to compile pertinent data from investigations\non space power tools and describe an optimum power source f o r operation in a\nspace environment. The majority of the tool concepts require further development and/or modifications to meet the standards for flight rated hardware.\nWith r e s p e c t to safety and reliability in a space environment, the most promising a r e electric dc power tools; however, other tool concepts a r e still under\ninvestigation.\nIn this report, a space tool is divided into t h r e e sections\n1.

F o r example, when w e\na r e considering a jig s a w , w e consider, in addition to the reciprocating motion\nof the saw blade, the translational motion of the s a w itself while i t i s making a\ncut. It i s this translational motion which puts the jig saw in the translation\ncategory. Table I shows the type of motion classification.\nTABLE I.

The\nfact w i l l develop that the inside tools c a n be used outside, but the r e v e r s e i s not\ntrue; that is, safety considerations r e s t r i c t certain tools and power s o u r c e s to\nuse only outside the spacecraft. Table I1 outlines this in c h a r t form.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE TOOLS\nThe various power s o u r c e s for s p a c e tools are listed (Table 1 1 , along\n1)\nwith the type of prime mover necessary to transform the power into mechanical\noutput. Available approximate power-to-weight ratios are given in Table III.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF TOOLS AND POWER SOURCES\nElectric Motor\nA minimum reaction space power tool w a s developed for the U.S. A i r\nF o r c e in 1963. Development objectives and design c r i t e r i a of the tool are discussed in Reference 2. The tool is a battery powered electrical motor that will\nd r i v e various attachments designed for a variety of rotary motion tasks such as\nnut running-, di-illifig, aiid sawing. The principle nf n ~ \\ ~ r a t i n n conversion of\nis\nthe continuous r o t a r y a r m a t u r e motion to a n intermediate reciprocating motion,\nand finally to intermittent, high amplitude r o t a r y motion of the output shaft, all\nmotions being related to the counter-rotating tool body.

A maximum reaction torque of 6 . 4 x\nm-N ( 0 . 9 in. -02) occurred\nduring 27.12 m-N ( 240 in. lb) torque output which exceeded the U. S. Air F o r c e\ncriterion of 20.34 m-N ( 180 in. -1b) . Subsequently, NASA-MSC funded a prog r a m f o r a Itspace Tool Survey Development and Evaluation Program" to:\n\n1. Define the requirements for design of space tools.\n2. Define the interface requirements between the tool s y s t e m s and the\nworker.\n3 . Fabricate a prototype tool kit based upon the requirements established at the beginning of the program.\n\nUnder the NASA-MSC contract, development work done previously under\nthe U.S. Air Force Contract w a s used a s a point of departure. The prime mover\nsection was defined, the various attachment sections were developed and tested,\na battery (silver-zinc) was selected, and the complete tool kit w a s developed.\nThe principle of operation w a s unchanged. The battery location w a s moved from\nthe tool handle to a remote kit because of its s i z e and weight increase from\n0.454 to 2 . 2 8 kg ( 1 to 5 lb) . The maximum reaction torque output is 115.25 m-N\n( 8 5 ft-lb) with 4 . 2 x\nm-N ( 6 in. -oz) reaction; the NASA-MSC goal was\nm-N ( 2 in. -oz) reaction during impacting.\n101.69 m-N-( 75 ft-lb) with 1 . 4 x\n\nGas Turbine\nReference 4 i s a description of a preliminary design and not a proven\nhardware item. It is entitled "Technical Description of a Minimum Reaction\nSpace Tool. " The principle of operation of this tool i s s i m i l a r to that of the\nelectric motor tool.\nThe principal design difference i s that this prime mover is a two stage\naxial flow turbine driven by high p r e s s u r e gas, hot o r cold, from a n external\nsource. The electric motor tool has mechanical bearings between the handle\nand the tool body which give r i s e to reaction torque caused by the friction.\nThis is virtually eliminated in this tool by using s o m e of the high p r e s s u r e g a s\nfor main bearings.\n\n6\n\nThe turbine speed i s made variable by controlling the inlet gas valve\nwith a trigger. Output shaft torque was calculated to be 59.66 m-N ( 4 4 ft-lb)\nfor assumed design and inlet conditions of 3 447 378.6 N/m2 (500 p s i ) and\n449.4"K (350\xc2\xb0F) with a m a s s flow through the unit of 0.005 kg/sec ( 0 . O i l\nlb/sec) .\n\nThermite Fueled Steam Generator\nThe information available briefly describes a conceptual design of a\nspace power tool which has a s t e a m generator f o r the space module [ 51. The\nthermite fuel i s contained in an expendable fuel cartridge which is inserted into\nl\nthe hand-held tool. Upon ignition, the heat of reaction 3 719 i ljoules/kg\n(1600 Btu/lb) i s t r a n s f e r r e d into steam boiler tubes located around the c a r t r i d g e\nchamber. The s t e a m at approximately 1 378 951 N/m2 (200 psi) and 699\xc2\xb0K\n( 800" F) i s throttled into a n energy converted ( a n axial-piston motor)\nAfter\nleaving the motor, the steam passes through condenser tubes on the outside of\nthe tool and then e n t e r s the r e s e r v o i r as water. The output shaft power is\nvaried by controlling a s t e a m by-pass valve with a trigger. The power output\nis specified to be f r o m 186 to 373 W ( 0 . 2 5 to 0 . 5 hp) with a fuel consumption of\n4.54 kg/hr ( 1 0 lb/hr) .\n\n.\n\nMonopropellant Powered Impulse Device\nReference 6 i s a technical description of a space tool conceptual design.\nThis document does not emphasize minimum reaction operations; basically, it\npresents a power module and prime mover concept and not an entire tool.\nThe power module is actually a hand-held gas generator to which various\nworking heads can be attached, utilizing liquid monopropellant (hydrazine) as\na fuel. The power module consists of a propellant supply, combustion chamber,\nigniter, appropriate valving and controls, and a means for precision adjustment\nof charge s i z e . The attachment modules contain different types of prime movers\nas well a s the mechanism required to convert the r o t a r y o r linear output of the\np r i m e mover into the desired output.\nThe shaft output i s calculated to be 11 185. 5 to 1 4 914.0 W ( 1 5 to 20 hp)\nf o r 5 to 10 seconds, producing 40.95 m-N ( 3 0 . 2 ft-lb) of torque at 3600 r p m\nf o r a hydraulic motor.\n\n7\n\nCartridge Driven Impact Devices\nThe information provided in the document describing this concept con-\n\nsists of photographs and a brief description of 5 . 6 m m ( 2 2 caliber) cartridge\npowered tools which have been built for industrial applications [ 7 ] . No suggestions were made toward an approach for applying a cartridge as a n energy\nsource for a minimum reaction space tool; however, such a tool i s feasible,\nand a prototype cartridge actuated tool is being evaluated at the present time.\nA second type is being developed by MSA t o include other operational features.\n\nAdvanced Electric Tool\nThis i s the r e s u l t of a n inhouse effort to determine the type of power\ns o u r c e that would be the s a f e s t and most reliable f o r operations in space. The\nbrushless dc motor was developed originally for satellite application. The\nresults of t h i s investigation and development effort a r e reported in Reference 8.\nThe brushless motor i s battery powered and i s being designed to drive\na n impactor type space tool amd a l s o to drive various attachments f o r tasks such\nas sawing, drilling, and nut tightening. In the brushless motor, the commutator\nfunction is duplicated by a solid state electronic switching s y s t e m that eliminates\nthe sliding contacts. The b r u s h l e s s unit uses a permanent magnet r o t o r for\nfield excitation and a slotted s t a t o r with a conventional dc a r m a t u r e winding.\nThe current in each coil of the a r m a t u r e winding i s reversed by a solid state\npower switching network [ 81. Switching for the electronic commutation proc e s s in the motor is provided by solid-state photo devices which are activated\nby a rotating beam of light. The output is calculated to be approximately\n746 W ( 1 hp) , producing 0 . 0 0 5 m-N ( 0 . 6 7 in. -oz) torque at 3000 rpm with\ninput power of 3 W a t 24 Vdc.\n\nEVALUATION OF THE VARIOUS POWER SOURCES\nEach power source was evaluated using the s a m e c r i t e r i a as information\nw a s available.\n\n8\n\nSafety\nTemperature. Any part of the space tool which could come in contact\nwith the astronaut must not become hotter than 394\xc2\xb0K (250" F) nor colder than\n116\xc2\xb0K ( -250" F ) during the longest expected use of the tool [ 91. The temperature\nof the tool should preferably not come close to either of these extremes for\nextended -we; probably 294" +2S"K ( 7 9 " 1 5 0 " F ) , o r f r z m 266" to 322\xc2\xb0K (20" to\n120" F) , would be safer and impose less load on the space s u i t environmental\ncontrol system. In addition, the exhaust products must lie within this temperat u r e range if there is a chance that they might impinge upon the astronaut.\nExhaust Products. The exhaust must be noncorrosive and non-contaminating if there i s chance of its impinging upon the astronaut o r upon a part of\nthe spacecraft where it could cause damage by corrosion o r become a source\nof contamination. In addition, if the tool is used within the confines of the\nspacecraft p r e s s u r e cabin, the exhaust gases must be nontoxic and impose no\nadditional load upon the environmental control system. In effect, this rules\nout all gas powered o r gas producing power tools for use within the spacecraft.\nThus, f o r internal cabin use, w e are already restricted to electric power o r\npossibly thermite-heated s t e a m power if the exhaust s t e a m i s retained within\nthe tool.\nSpent Fuel Disposal. If fuel cartriges a r e used, some provision m u s t\nbe made for their safe disposal. If, a s in the c a s e of thermite fuel cartridges,\nthey are extremely hot, they must either be allowed time to cool, o r be disposable and storable without having the astronaut come in contact with them.\nIf the spent cartridges are stored in the spacecraft, they must be resealed to\ninsure that no spent material gets loose in the cabin. If t h e r e i s a possibility\nof any m a t e r i a l getting out, the toxicity of the spent cartridge must be considered\nEjecta Caused by Exhaust. The space tool power source must be designed\ns o that its exhaust does not blow chips o r cuttings away f r o m the work site. It\nalso must not damage adjacent equipment, wiring, and s o on.\nCable Fouling. If there is a cable o r hose connecting the tool to either\na r e m o t e power s o u r c e o r the astronaut, the possibility of fouling this cable\nm u s t be considered. The effect of cutting o r pulling loose this cable o r hose\nen the a s t r z n a ~ t fsafety m-l& he evaluated. F o r example, in the c a s e of a\ns\nhydrazine-powered tool with a remote tank, cutting of the hydrazine line would\nresult in contamination and possible blinding of the astronaut. A suitably\na r m o r e d hose could be provided, but a t a substantial weight penalty.\n\n9\n\nHandling of Fuel. If the fuel i s toxic, corrosive, o r contaminating,\neither it must be in sealed containers o r provision must be made f o r remote\nfilling of the supply tank. F o r example, if the hydrazine f r o m the maneuvering\nunit is to be used, all connections must a s s u r e no possibility of leakage during\na filling operation.\n\nTotal Power and Power to Mass Requirements\nStorage Volume to Weight for Used and Unused Fuel. In the c a s e of\npackaged fuel, the weight and volume of the fuel cartridges makes the theoretical power to weight to volume r a t i o worse. If the used fuel cartridges a r e\nretained, storage space must be provided for them, possibly in the s a m e area\nwhere the unused cartridges were stored. It is obvious that packaged fuel does\nnot offer as attractive a solution to extensive space work as does bulk fuel, at\nleast a s far a s weight and volume are concerned.\nPower to M a s s Ratio. Naturally, the system with the highest power /\nm a s s ratio is the most attractive f r o m the standpoint of launching it. Ultimately,\nthe power/mass ratio will be one of the major deciding factors in the evaluation\nof a candidate space power tool system.\nRecharge Capability. Provisions must be made to insure that the power\nsupply, when depleted, can be recharged. F o r the c a s e of batteries, suitable\nc h a r g e r s must be supplied, powered by either s o l a r c e l l s , fuel cells, o r other\navailable means. The fuel cells must be kept supplied with fuel, and replacement batteries must be stocked. If the space tool i s a self-contained hydrazinepowered unit, for example, a refill capability m u s t be designed in f o r any\nextended use period. F o r long t e r m usage, bulk loading of the monopropellant\nhas advantages over cartridge loading, but both types must be considered.\nCertain systems naturally lend themselves m o r e readily to recharging than\nothers.\n\nOther Considerat ions\nEmergency Power Source. In c a s e of a n emergency power failure, the\nspace tool should be useable, but this may not be a r e a l i s t i c situation. Generally,\na major power failure on a spacecraft would s o jeopardize the mission that the\nchance of such a failure must be minimized by having redundant power s y s t e m s .\nIt may not, therefore, be realistic to consider performing operations under a\n\n10\n\n\\\n\ncondition of power failure. It would amount to an unnecessary capability,\nalthough most of the tool systems proposed would work, at least f o r a s h o r t\ntime, without spacecraft power. A completely packaged power tool system,\nsuch a s the thermite system, might be considered to have an advantage h e r e ,\nbut it is slight. Both the electrical system and the hot gas system require spacecraft power for recharge - either battery recharge o r electrical power to open\nvalves. So far t h e r e a r e v e r y few hand operated valves on any existing spacecraft.\nAvailability of Power Source on Existing Spacecraft. P a r t of the\nrecharge/use capability of a space power tool s y s t e m depends on power supplies\no r fuel being normally aboard the spacecraft - either fuel/solar cells for\nbattery recharging, o r monopropellant fuel f o r the gas generator powered tool.\nThe advantage of using existing power o r fuel i s that existing systems can\nm e r e l y be increased in s i z e r a t h e r than duplicated, a situation which will cause\na significant weight reduction. The increased capability system will, in general,\nweigh less than the duplicated system.\nOther U s e s of the Power Module. Other (non-direct tool) uses of the\npower module can often aid in the completion of a mission. A s an example, a\ngas generator power supply could provide gas for an inflatable s t r u c t u r e if the\nexhaust gases were compatible with the structure materials and possible habitation restrictions. Direct electric power is necessary f o r lighting, but could\na l s o be used to heat r e s t r a i n t attachment adhesives o r to power magnetomotive\nforming, punching, o r fastening tools.\nMinimum Reaction Requirements. Gas-powered tools must be designed\nin such a way that the exhaust gases do not generate reaction forces. Such power\ntools can present a v e r y difficult design problem. Naturally, electric tools,\nhaving no exhaust g a s e s , do not present this problem.\n\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nGeneral\nF o r a tool system to be useable within the cabin, it must meet the\nfollowing requirements ; absence of non-life-supporting exhaust gases; no\ns e v e r e temperature load imposed on environment system; and no chips, cuttings ,\no r ejecta. These requirements eliminate the gas-powered tools (exhaust g a s e s\nand temperature) , the thermite steam-powered tools (temperature) , and the\n\n11\n\ncartridge powered tools (exhaust gases). The use of saws, d r i l l s , files, Sande r s , chisels, and g r i n d e r s i s eliminated because of the chips and cuttings. A tool\nusing chemical bonding can a l s o present a problem because of the fumes. We\nare thus led to the conclusion that only electrical power ( e i t h e r from sealed\nbatteries or from an external power source - fuel cell, r e a c t o r , e t c . ) o r hand\npower will be s a f e for use within the spacecraft, and, furthermore, certain\ntools must be prohibited because of chips, cuttings, ejecta, and s o on.\n\nThe result of this restriction on power tools for interior use leads us to\nt h r e e choices for tool system power:\n1. Use no power tools in spacecraft interior. Redesign existing hand\ntools and tether s y s t e m s t o do a better job in the zero-gravity environment.\nSince for most jobs within the spacecraft a spacesuit will not be necessary,\nhand tools can be used m o r e easily. The power tool with the b e s t power/mass\nr a t i o can then be chosen for the outside t a s k s . The advantage of this approach\nis that only one power tool system need be developed. The disadvantage i s that\nno power tools a r e available for inside work.\n2 . U s e only electrical power tools that a r e suitable both inside and outside the spacecraft. The advantage of this is that only one power tool need be\ndeveloped, and it can be used anywhere; the disadvantage i s that for long t e r m\nusage, other power tools may have a better power/mass ratio.\n3. Use electrical power inside and whichever unit gives the best power/\n\nm a s s ratio outside. This approach could have a weight advantage over the\nsecond alternative for sufficiently long missions. The disadvantage i s that two\npower units need to be developed. We next need to consider the point at which\nthe weight of some advanced power tool s y s t e m p l u s a n inside electrical s y s t e m\nc r o s s e s over a pure inside-outside electrical s y s t e m .\nF i r s t w e briefly consider the power cord problem. F o r a gas generator\nsystem to have significant weight advantages, it m u s t make bulk use of the\ngenerant. This means a remote tank and pressurization s y s t e m ( s i n c e a r e m o t e\ngas generator and hot high pressure gas line i s less attractive than a cold\ngenerant pressure line from a s o u r c e to a generator mounted on the space t o o l ) .\nIt s e e m s reasonable to assume that an electrical w i r e will present fewer probl e m s than a p r e s s u r e hose since it can be made s m a l l e r , less subject to damage,\nand thus s a f e r and more flexible.\n\n12\n\nWe assume that both electrical power and monopropellant will be available\non the spacecraft o r on the S-IVB Orbital Workshop, and that furthermore we\nneed not consider a major electrical power failure a s this i s such an extreme c a s e\nas to constitute a mission failure. In any case, both a battery-powered tool and\na propellant gas-powered tool would be useable a s long as their self-contained\npower lasted. Probably neither could be recharged in the event of a power failme.\nW e concluded previously that 186 W to 373 W ( 0 . 2 5 to 0 . 5 hp) would be\nadequate to power all the candidate tool modules, and that a r o t a r y type prime\nmover offered advantages over other types in that it was capable of driving the\nl a r g e s t number of tools. We w i l l therefore consider candidate power s y s t e m s\nwhich are capable of producing approximately 186 W to 373 W in a rotary device,\n\nCandidate Systems\n1.\n\nElectric Motor [ 3 ]\n\na.\n\nSpecifications\nWeight of Power Supply:\n\n2 . 2 1 kg ( 5 lb)\n\nWeight of P r i m e Mover:\n\n2.56 kg ( 5 . 6 2 lb)\n\nPower Supply Capacity:\n\n163 W-hr\n\nPower to Weight of Power Supply: 71.7 W-hr/kg ( 3 2 . 6 W-hr/lb)\nType of Power Supply:\nType of P r i m e Mover:\n\nb.\n\nCommercial silver-zinc rechargeable\nbatteries.\nPermanent magnet 12-Vdc motor with\nminimum reaction features.\n\nComputations\n\nU s e time to depletion:\n\nat 373 W ( 0 . 5 hp) - rate, 1572 seconds\no r 26.2 minutes; at 746 W ( 1 hp) r a t e ,\n786 seconds o r 13.1 minutes; o r 586 356\nTXl--nn\n\nvv\n\n-3Gb\n\nl V 9 C\n[ I U"\n\nhn-car.\n")\n,\n\n(13.1 hp-min)\n\n,\n\n9773 W-min\n\n.\n\n13\n\n2.\n\nG a s Turbine [ 41\n\na.\n\nSpecifications\nWeight of Power Supply:\n\nunspecified\n\nWeight of Prime Mover:\n\n2 . 3 kg ( 5 . 1 5 lb)\n\nPower Requirements:\n\nPower Output:\n\n0.0051 kg/sec (0.0112 lb/sec) gas flow\nat 3 447 378.6 N/m2 (500 psig) and\n449.4"K (350" F) . This a s s u m e s\ny = 1.33, R = 448.02 m-N/kg/"K\n( 8 3 ft-lb/lb/"R) .\n\nThe turbine produces approximately 438 W\n( 0 . 5 8 7 shaft hp) at 25 750 r p m . This is\nreduced to 377 W ( 0 . 5 0 5 hp) and 45 r p m in\nthe reduction and r e v e r s i n g gears.\n\nType of Power Supply:\nType of P r i m e Mover:\n\nb.\n\nunspecified type of gas generator.\ntwo-stage axial-flow turbine with\nreduction gear and gas bearings.\n\nComputations\n\nIf we assume a monopropellant hydrazine gas generator with the low\nturbine inlet temperature, our molecular weight will be about 11. This changes\nR to approximately 756 m-N/kg/"K\n(140 ft-lb/lb/"R) and changes the mass\nflow rate to 3. 9 g r a m s / s e c ( 0 . 00862 lb/sec) . This results in a flow rate of\nmoles/sec o r 0.00797 m3/sec (0.2815 SCF/sec) . If w e assume\n7.84 x\nthat for a sufficiently large gas generator w e can get 1.247 m3/kg ( 2 0 SCF/lb)\nof gas generator [ 101, w e get 6 . 4 g r a m s / s e c (0.01407 lb/sec) f o r 377 W\n(0.505 hp) . This looks extremely unfavorable f o r this candidate, but two\nthings should be noted before we r e j e c t it completely. F i r s t , the turbine p e r formance could be greatly improved by using a higher inlet p r e s s u r e and,\nsecond, the efficiency of the reduction g e a r s could be slightly improved.\n3.\n\nAxial Piston Motor [ 111\n\na.\n\nSpecifications\nWeight of power Source:\n\n14\n\nnot specified.\n\nWeight of Prime Mover:\nInput Requirements:\n\n0.91 kg ( 2 lb) estimated.\n\n14 478 990.12 N/m2 (2100 psig) gas\nf r o m 233\' to 1310\xc2\xb0K (-40" to 1900\xc2\xb0F)\nat approximately 0.0015 kg/sec\n( 0.0034 lb/sec) f o r approximately\n418 W ( 0 . 5 6 hp) output at 7000 r p m .\nComposition of gas is unspecified.\n\nType of Power Source:\nType of P r i m e Mover:\n\nb.\n\nunspecified type of gas generator.\nbent axis type axial piston motor.\nThese figures are estimated f r o m a\n4117 W, 1 . 6 8 kg ( 5 . 6 hp, 3 . 7 lb) unit.\n\nComputations\n\nIf we again a s s u m e a molecular weight of 11 and 1.247 m3/kg (20 SCF/lb)\nof gas generator, w e see that we obtain 0.0031 m3/sec ( 0 . 1 1 1 SCF/sec) o r\n0.0025 kg (0.0055 lb) of gas generator p e r second. F o r 418 W ( 0 . 5 6 hp) and\n2.27 kg ( 5 lb) , we g e t 379 714 W-sec (509 hp-sec) . Again, this does not look\nfavorable compared to electrical power.\n4.\n\nAdvanced Electric Tool\n\nIf w e consider the additional advantages that fuel cells provide over\nbatteries, w e see that electrical tools can offer significant weight and safety\nadvantages over other s y s t e m s . As an example, a n Apollo type fuel cell has a\npower density of approximately 880 W-hr/kg (400 W-hr/lb) as opposed t o the\nbest s i l v e r zinc battery\'s maximum of 220 W-hr/kg (100 W-hr/lb) . The actual\nbatteries used in the minimum reaction tool have a power density of 71.7 W-hr/kg\nIn addition, a motor that is lighter than off-the-shelf i t e m s\n( 3 2 . 6 W-hr/lb).\ncan be developed.\n5.\n\nOther Power Sources\n\nWhile the thermite-fueled steam generator [ 51, the monopropellant\npowered impulse device [ 61 , and the cartridge-driven impact devices [ 71 all\nhave high power-to-weight ratios, none of them includes a device to convert\nthe power into r o t a r y motion. Since this i s probably the main source of\ninefficiency, it i s v e r y difficult to assign a realistic total power-to-weight ratio.\n\n15\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nOn the basis of existing and proposed space tool power s o u r c e s , the\nadvanced electrical power source offers significant safety and power/mass\nadvantages over any other proposed system. This result i s primarily due\nto difficulty in converting the tremendous thermal energy available in existing\nmonopropellants into useful rotational mechanical power and the difficulty in\ncontaining the toxicants generated from tool use.\nWe recommend that emphasis be placed upon developing a purely elect r i c a l rotary driven tool system for space use, at least until a new power s y s tem i s proposed with a significantly better power to weight r a t i o and safety\nfactor than a brushless d c electrical unit using batteries and fuel c e l l s . We\nmust bear in mind that only electrically driven devices are suitable f o r use\nwithin the spacecraft interior, and that any other tool power system must a l s o\ninclude provisions for electrical operation within the spacecraft.\nSome of the types mentioned in the classification section have not been\ncommercially developed; however, none of the types listed should be difficult\nto develop if their use i s deemed necessary.\n\n16\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nSpace Vehicle Power Sources Handbook.
