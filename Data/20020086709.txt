Direction of the project was as-\n\nin the background\nis a fairsized community\non what\nwas recently highly productive farmland.\nA 1981 U.S.\nDepartment\nof Agriculture\n(USDA) study estimated\nthat the nation is converting\nfarmland to non-agricultural\nuses at the rate of 3 million\n\nsigned to the Florida Department of Community\nAffairs\n(DCA), with assistance from\nthe Department\ntation (DOT),\n\nacres a year.\nSeeking reliable information on farmland loss in\n\nexpertise in satellite remote\nsensing operations. As\nMMALP project director,\nDCA assigned Robert Groce,\na resource conservationist\non\nloan from the USDA Soil\nConservation\nService. At\n\nFlorida, the state legislaturemin\n1984--directed\nestablishment\nof a program\nfor development\nof accurate\ndata to enable intelligent\nlegislation of state growth\nmanagement.\nThus was born\nFlorida\'s massive Mapping\nand Monitoring of Agriculrural Lands Project\n(MMALP),\nwhich was to\nemploy data from the\nNASA-developed\nLandsat\nEarth resources survey satellite system as a quicker, less\nexpensive alternative to\nground surveying.\nThe three year project in-\n\nright above, Groce (standing) is comparing notes with\nFlorida DOT remote sensing\nspecialist Jesse Day.\nThe utility of the Landsat\nsystem for land cover survey\nstems from the fact that each\n\n108\n\nEnvironment\n\nprepared.\nMMALP\n\nAn example of an\nimage is shown be-\n\nlow; here pastureland\nis\nhighlighted\nin red and the\nother colors represent cropland, woodland and devel-\n\ntype of land cover emits or\nreflects a unique type of radiation that can be detected\nand differentiated\nLandsat\'s sensors.\n\npare a land cover dassification map of a segment of\n\n_ii_iiii_iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii::ii_!_i::::iii!i!_!!i_i:_i!!_iii::i!_i_iiiii_1ii_:ii!!iii_4\nil_iiiiiiiiii::::_iliiii_ii_::iii_I_iii\ni_\n\n_\n\nprocessing of Landsat data at\nground facilities enables creation of electronic imagery or\ntapes from which informative resource maps can be\n\noped areas.

Maps like these,\ncovering all of the state\'s 67\ncounties, were prepared with\n1984 data, and those maps\nwere compared with another\nset of maps for the same\nareas developed with 1973\nLandsat data, thus providing\na graphic comparison\nof the\nland cover changes that had\noccurred over the 11-year\nspan.\nEarly in the project, Groce\ndecided that combining soil\ndata with the Landsat land\ncover data would make\navailable to land use planners\n\na more comprehensive\nview\nof a county\'s land potential.\nHe obtained the cooperation\nof the USDA Soil Conservation Service, which agreed to\ndigitize--and\npay for--soil\nsurveys for two counties,\nwith data for the other counties to come later. At upper\nright, MMALP soil scientist\nSusan Ploetz is preparing an\noverlay that incorporates\nUSDA soil data. Addition of\ndata on soil types and\ncharacteristics\nallows farmers\nand state officials to determine whether a particular\nblock of land has prime agricultural soil and what types\nof crops might be grown\nthere; it also gives developers\nan overview of areas with\nland characteristics\nbest\n\n(below).\n\nThis involved\n\ntak-\n\ning actual soil samples at a\nparticular site or visually\nchecking the vegetation to\nmake sure the computer\nprocessed information\nwas\naccurate. The information\nproved accurate.\nIn July 1987, Florida\'s\nDCA completed the\nMMALP project and later in\nthe year submitted\na report\nto the state legislature. It\nshowed the agricultural land\nacreage for each county as of\n1973 and 1984 and the percentage of loss of agricultural\n\nland over that span. The total farmland lost to non-agricultural developments\nwas\n1,683,986\nacres, or 5.6 percent. This was substantially\nless than had been estimated\nin other assessments made\nprior to MMALP. However,\nsome counties showed significant losses and they will\nhave to be monitored.\nThe report also detailed\nthe acreage in each of 21\nland cover classifications as\n\nmented by all-state soil data,\nbuilt a comprehensive\ncomputerized data base that provides Florida officials an important planning tool. This\nwas the first effort to use\nLandsat data for mapping an\nentire state and, says project\ndirector Robert Groce, "Everyone seems to be satisfied\nwith the process and with\nthe results."_\n\nof 1984. The agricultural\nland and total cover information, eventually\n\nto be supple-\n\nsuited to the needs of a\nplanned development.\nTo verify the data going\ninto the land cover maps,\nboth USDA soil data and\nLandsat sensor data, the\nMMALP group made frequent "ground truth" tests\n\nEnvironment I09\n\n'
