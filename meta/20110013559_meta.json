In development since 2001, it has been successfully demonstrated in support of a number of actual missions within NASA's Suborbital Science Program. Improvements to software configuration control were needed to properly support both an ongoing transition to operational status and continued evolution of REVEAL capabilities. For this reason the project described in this report targets REVEAL software source documentation and deployment of the software on a small set of hardware platforms different from what is currently used in the baseline system implementation. This presentation specifically describes the actions taken over a ten week period by two undergraduate student interns and serves as an overview of the content of the final report for that internship.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20110013559, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Univ.", "location": "Prescott, AZ, United States"}}, "meetingId": "2958aa66f4b94aeba166600ec918ea63", "id": "c42d5eb6a4c042ec9a1550a107e9199b"}], "name": "REVEAL: Software Documentation and Platform Migration", "location": "Prescott, AZ", "id": "2958aa66f4b94aeba166600ec918ea63", "startDate": "2011-03-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110013559, "id": "e75bdda178e645bba5097c3a326e85bf", "publicationDate": "2011-06-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110013559.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110013559/downloads/20110013559.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110013559/downloads/20110013559.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110013559/downloads/20110013559.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
