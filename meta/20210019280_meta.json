Methods included secure communication to prevent unauthorized access to data, consistency of data obtained via sensors and by processing, and built-in safeguards to prevent mission failure. The motivation for this work are the following. The future air transportation system needs to ensure availability, integrity, confidentiality and safety of operations. Safety of vehicles and operations is paramount for successful integration of Urban Air Mobility (UAM), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), supersonic aircraft and launch vehicles with conventional aviation operations in the National Airspace System. Security is becoming critical because the sensors, networks and computers are far more vulnerable to bad actors than their mechanical or human predecessors. The goal therefore is to design and develop cyber-resilient systems that continue to function even in degraded states. The main findings are (1) off-the-shelf hardware can support development of cyber-resilient onboard flight computers and (2) trust in system design and implementation can be accomplished by integrating layers in depth (detail) and in breadth (scope).", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210019280, "endDate": "2021-08-06T07:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "3f9179ca2db44a86b918a61412f79113", "id": "1cefa1f571304c938c1ef9bdc55a30d5"}], "name": "AIAA Aviation Forum", "location": "Virtual Event", "id": "3f9179ca2db44a86b918a61412f79113", "url": "https://www.aiaa.org/aviation", "startDate": "2021-08-02T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20210019280_Chatterji_Aviation2021.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210019280/downloads/20210019280_Chatterji_Aviation2021.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210019280/downloads/20210019280_Chatterji_Aviation2021.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210019280/downloads/20210019280_Chatterji_Aviation2021.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
