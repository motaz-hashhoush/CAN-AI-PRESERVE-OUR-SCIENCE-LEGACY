This mode of wind transport is only observed for sustained periods in water on earth; thus, there are similarities between aqueous fluid transport on earth and atmospheric transport on Venus. The formation of small sand ridges and grooves oriented parallel to the wind direction is associated with the rolling of grains in Venusian simulations and these structures may be unique aeolian features on Venus.", "title": "Transport of Venusian rolling 'stones' by wind?", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T10:40:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850044994, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Greeley, R."}, "organization": {"name": "Arizona State Univ.", "location": "Tempe, AZ, United States"}}, "id": "34655804ac0740d59f6f38eb06f5616d"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19850044994, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Marshall, J.
