The Russian experiments were designed to determine the effects of space flight on immunological parameters. The Russian experiment included the first in-flight dissection of rodents that allowed the determination of kinetics of when space flight affected immune responses. The support given the Russians by this laboratory was to carry out assays for immunologically important cytokines that could not readily be carried out in their home laboratories. These included essays of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and possibly other cytokines.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960009417, "id": "bd15b5d44a0843149e78b9f2a7825468", "publicationDate": "1995-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960009417.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960009417/downloads/19960009417.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960009417/downloads/19960009417.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960009417/downloads/19960009417.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
