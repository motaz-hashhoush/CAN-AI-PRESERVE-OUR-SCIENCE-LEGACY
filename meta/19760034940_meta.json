A constant envelope television FM signal was transmitted at C  band to the ATS-6 earth coverage horn and retransmitted at 860 MHz through the 9-m antenna to a low-cost direct-readout ground station. The experiment demonstrated that high-quality television and audio can  be received by low-cost direct-receive ground stations. Predetection  bandwidths significantly less than predicted by Carson's rule can be  utilized with minimal degradation of either monochrome or color pictures. Two separate techniques of dual audio channel transmission have  been demonstrated to be suitable for low-cost applications.", "title": "ATS-6 - Television Relay Using Small Terminals Experiment", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T12:10:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19760034940, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Miller, J.
