Two material thicknesses were examined: 0.063 in. and 0.125 in. Middle crack tension and compact tension specimens were excised from 60 in. wide middle crack tension panels which had been previously tested at Boeing. The crack resistance curves generated were compared to the R-curves from 60 in. wide specimens. The experimental program indicated that effective stress intensity from secant compliance based crack length and stress intensity calculated from J-integral testing were equivalent. In addition, comparison of different specimen sizes and configurations indicated that standard validity requirements for compact tension specimens may be overly restrictive.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950010445, "id": "730e41497929467c9dfe426e66acac45", "publicationDate": "1994-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19950010445.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19950010445/downloads/19950010445.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19950010445/downloads/19950010445.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19950010445/downloads/19950010445.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
