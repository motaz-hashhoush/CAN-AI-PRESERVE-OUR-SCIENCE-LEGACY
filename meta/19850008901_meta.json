The antenna and the radar sensor are subsystems carried over from SIR-A to SIR-B with some modifications. The optical recorder (OR) is unchanged from that used in SIR-A. Important new elements in SIR-B are antenna electronics that allow selectable look angles, a digital data handling subsystem (DDHS), increased bandwidth, a calibrator, and a digital data processor on the ground. A list of the SIR-B characteristics is given. Radio-frequency (RF) pulses at 1.28 GHz (L-band) are generated in the transmitter portion of the sensor and radiated by the antenna. The RF signals are reflected from the Earth, collected by the antenna, and sent to the receiver portion of the sensor where they are beaten down to baseband to form the offset video output. This output is then sent to either the CR, the DDHS, or both. An end to end system block diagram is given.", "title": "Experiment description", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T13:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19850008901, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850008901, "id": "40c2736ab27046688ab9216bf31d7fdc", "publicationName": "The SIR-B Sci.
