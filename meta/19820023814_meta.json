The umbilical doors of the space shuttle orbiter are required to be open during vehicle launch. After the external tank is released, the doors are closed. Presently, the device for maintaining the doors in an open position is mounted on the external tank and therefore has a single mission life. The latching mechanism of the invention is mounted in the orbiter and therefore is returned and has multimission capability. The latching mechanism is comprised of a pair of concentric nested, cylindrical cams and motors to actuate the cams, and latch pin all contained within a cover mounted on a support bracket carried by the substructure. A shaft having a latch pin is mounted inside the inner cylindrical cam.", "title": "CAM controlled retractable door latch", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-04T15:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820023814, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Carsley, R.
