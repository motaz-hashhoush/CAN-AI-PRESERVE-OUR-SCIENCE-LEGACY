Field of the Invention\n\nInsulating tiles which are reusable and suitable for\nuse at high temperatures.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nIn the past, reusable surface insulation materials have\nbeen formed by bonding ceramic fibers with an inorganic binder. Among the fibers used have been silica,\nmullite, alumino silicate and zirconia. A large variety of\nbinders has been used, including organometallic precursors, colloidal oxides and finely divided glasses. The\nRSI materials are furnace cured to obtain the desired\nproperties.\nThe prior art composition suffer from a number of\ndisadvantages. The currently available silica reusable\nsurface insulation qaterials are made by a very complex process that requires from two to four weeks in\nPro\nThe material of the present invention can\nbe\nthree days. Fythermore, the mechanical\nproperties and/or thermal stability of the prior art materials are inferior to those of the present invention.\nThe materials of the present invention are superior to\nthe prior art materials in that they are less expensive,\nrequire less time to fabricate and have superior mechanical and/or thermal properties.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nThe sole FIGURE of the drawing is a pictorial diagram showing the steps necessary for preparing insulating materials in accordance with the present invention.\nDESCRIPTION O F THE PREFERRED\nEMBODIMENTS \'\n\n2\nsurface impurities by washing alternately in hydrochloric acid (pH=3) and deionized water. This treatment\ngenerally has a small effect on bulk chemical composition. The small quantities of impurities removed have a\n5 significant effect on devitrification and shrinkage with\nsome fiber lots, however. Average fiber diameter\ndiamater of the Microquartz 108 fiber is 1 to 2.5 microns. Larger fibers up to 6 microns can also be used.\nFiber length should be less than ?4 inch. or stratifica10 tion, during molding, and cracking of the resulting tile\nmay occur. If the fiber is too long for efficient use, it is\nchopped before use. .\nThe quantity of fiber, relative to the quantity of colloidal silica can be varied through a rather broad range\n15 with satisfactory results. For a quantity of fiber of from\n200 to 400 gms, it has been found suitable to use from\n1,000 to 3,000 gms. of binder solution which consists of\n0.5 to 1.0% colloidal silica, 0.025% to 1% reagent\ngrade starch and 1 to 5 ml. ammonia.\n20 The binder solution is dispersed in a high speed mixer\nand then blended with the drained fibers and water in a\nV-b!ender for 30 minutes. The pH is adjusted to 9.0\nwith ammonia. An intensifier bar in the V-blender is\nused to break up fiber clumps. The use of the V25 blender with an intensifier bar is unique to this invention. It allows use of a relatively viscous slurry, and\ngives a better fiber dispersion than other mixing methods. The resulting superior material is largely due to\nthis mixing process. The slurry is poured into a mold for\n30 either single direction or multi-direction pressing and\nrapidly pressed at 10-20 psi. Final tile density is controlled by fiber content and molded dimensions and\nmay vary from 7 to 30 Ib/ft3. Great care must be taken\nto avoid contamination of the raw materials during the\n35 process. All utensils and mixing vessels are polyethylene or stainless steel and only deionized water is used\nin any step in the process. The tile is then dried in an\noven for 18 hours. The temperature is raised at the rate\nof 20F per hour to a maximum temperature of 300\xc2\xb0F\n40 and held for the remainder of the cycle. The tile is\ntaken directlv from the drving oven and daced in the\nfiring furnace and fired. A furnace must be used that\nhas no alkali or alkaline earth oxide impurities in the\nvicinity of the tile being fired. A temperature rise rate\n45 of 300"F/hr. or less is required to avoid cracking and\nwarping the 6 X 6 X 3 inch tiles. For larger tiles, slower\nheating may be required. The time-at-temperature and\nthe exact maximum firing temperature are dependent\non the fiber used. Less stable fiber lots are fired for\n50 shorter time and at a lower temperature. Shrinkage of\neach fiber lot differs during processing and requires\ndifferent initial as-cast densities in order to obtain the\nsame final tile density. Maximum firing temperature\nvaries from 2200\xc2\xb0F to 2400\'F. The firing cycle allows\n55 sufficient time for sintering and stabilization relative to\nshrinkage while not allowing excessive shrinkage or any\ndcviation of the tile. The starch burns out at a temperature of about 800"F, leaving a pure silica unbonded\nstructure. At about 2300\xc2\xb0F fiber-to-fiber sintering oc60 curs at a fairly rapid rate. It appears that the final tile\nproperties are determined by fiber-to-fiber sintering at\nleast as much as they are by fiber-to-binder sintering.\nShrinkage and sintering during firing are much more\nrapid with binder than without, allowing shorter firing\n65 times and thus, increasing long-term stability of thc tile.\nIn general, shrinkage during firing is 25-45% by volume. Warpage during firing can be a significant problem because the tile has essentially no strength at the\n.\n\naterial of the present invention is\nfabricated utilizing high purity silica fibers, colloidal\n(fumed) silica as a binder and reagent grade starch as a\ntemporary binder. Tiles or other desired shapes can be\nmade having densities of from 7 to 30 pounds per cubic\nfoot. The silica fiber and silica binder are selected so\nthat they will be stable with respect to devitrification at\ntemperatures over 2000\xc2\xb0F for long periods of time. The\nstarch must be pure in order not to leave a residue\nwhich would contaminate the finished product, but, as\n.will be later apparent, it is burned out during a processing step and does not form a part of the finished composition. The final composition preferably contains\nfrom 95 to 98% of silica fibers with the balance being\ncolloidal silica binder.\nan be utilized in practicing\nVarious raw materi\nthe invention and one\nble form of silica fiber is that\nknown as Microquartz 108 fiber manufacturcd by\nville, which is at least 98.5% pure silica.\nuitable starting material is the high purity\nena, Califiber is its\ne fiber not\nthan 0.3%\nhave a total bulk\nt should be\nand the total alkali\nbelow 0.06%. The fibers are usua4ly treated to remove\n\nY\n\n3,952,083\n\n3\n\nfiring temperature. Temperature gradients in the tile\nare likely to cause warping. Warping can also occur\ndue to sagging of an unsupported tile during firing.\nAfter firing, the tiles are machined to obtain exact\ndimensions. Usually about 0.5 cm of material is machined off.\nFrequently, it is desirable to modify the optical properties of the tile and this can be accomplished by adding an imprcgant to the slurry in concentrations of 0.1\nto 2% solids. The impregnant should be finally divided\nand preferably is smaller than 300 mesh. Various oxides such as chromium and cobalt oxide as well as\nsilicon carbide can be used.\nThe binder is a finely divided silica. The material sold\nunder the trade name CAB-0-SIL M5 by the Cabot\nCorporation has been found suitable. CAB-0-SIL M5\nis a colloidal silica prepared by a vapor phase hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride. It has high chemical purity,\nlow water content, an enormous external surface area\nand a high degree of particle separation. Because of\nthese properties, it functions in extremely small quantities as a binder in forming the insulation of the present\ninvention.\nAny purified starch can be used in carrying out the\ninvention and it is normally preferred to use chemically\npure reagent grade starch.\nThe steps in carrying out the present invention are\nshown in the drawing. Great care must be taken to\navoid contamination of the raw materials during the\nprocess and all of the utensils and mixing vessels are\npolyethylene or stainless steel and only deionized water\nis used in any step of the process. The fibers are first\nwashed in a drum 1 with hydrochloric acid for about\none hour at a pH of 3 using pure nitrogen as the agitating agent. This is done several times until the fiber is\nsufficiently clean. At the same time the binder solution,\nwhich consists of amorphous silica, starch and water, is\nprepared in a mixer 3 and the fibers and the binder are\nadded together and blended thoroughly in a blender 5\nas a very viscous slurry. After blending, the materials\nare shaped in a mold 7 and then dried in oven 9. The\ndry tiles are then fired in kiln 11 for the required length\nof time and temperature to produce the finished tiles\n13. The tiles are then machined to a desired size and\nshape.\nThe following non-limiting examples illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention.\n\n4\n\nsteel twin shell V-blender having 8 quart capacity.\nDeionized water was added to bring the total water to\n7,000 grams. The ingredients were mixed for 30 minutes with the blender running on a 5-minute-on and\n5-minute-off cycle. The slurry was then transferred to a\nmold and pressed to a 6 X 6 X 2%inches tile at a pressure of 10-20 psi. The bottom and sides of the mold\nwere perforated and covered with a 200 mesh stainless\nsteel screen to allow excess water to flow out. The tiles\nIo were then dried in a drying oven on an 18-hour cycle\nbeginning at a temperature of 50\xc2\xb0F for one hour which\nwas increased at a rate of 20\xc2\xb0F per hour to 220\xc2\xb0F and\nheld for four hours and the temperature then raised 20"\nper hour to 300\xc2\xb0F and maintained at this temperature\nl 5 until the tiles were placed in a curing furnace. In the\nfurnace the curing cycle was 300\xc2\xb0F per hour to 2300\xc2\xb0F.\nheld 2% hours, lowered 300\xc2\xb0F per hour to 1800\xc2\xb0F when\nthe furnace was turned off and allowed to cool to\n300\xc2\xb0F. The total firing time was 24 hours. The tile was\n2o now machined from 5% X 5% X 2 inches in accordance\nwith usual machining practice to the desired size.\nEXAMPLE 1\n1\n25\n\n3o\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nEXAMPLE 1\nIn accordance with this example, tiles 5 X 5 X 1%\ninches having a density of 15 pounds per cubic foot\nwere produced. About 260 grams of Microquartz 108\nfiber were placed in a polyethylene barrel with 8 gallons of deionized water and 10 to 20 ml. of hydrochloric acid were added to bring the pH to about 3. Pure\nnitrogen was bubbled through the mixture to agitate\nthe fiber and aid in the washing. Washing was continued for 2 hours. The acidic water was drained off and\nfresh deionized water was added and the mixture again\nagitated with pure nitrogen for 10 minutes. This process was repeated until the rinse water had a pH of\nabout 6, which ordinarily requires 3 rinses.\nIn a separate vessel, the binder was prepared by combining 20 grams of reagent grade starch, 30 grams of\nCAB-0-SIL M5 and 2 ml NH,OH and 1,000 grams\ndeionized water; the binder was mixed for 2 minutes in\na suitable mixer suck as a Waring blender. The wet\nfiber and binder slurry were combined in a stainlcss\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nIn accordance with this example, a similar tile was\nmade except that the density was 9 pounds per cubic\nfoot. The starting materials were 300 grams of Microquartz 108 washed in the same manner as Example\nI and the binder was 30 grams of reagent grade starch,\n50 grams CAB-0-SIL M5 and 2 ml NH,OH. This mixture was added to 1,000 grams deionized water and\nmixed for 2 minutes.\nThe materials were combined in twin shell VBlender; deionized water was added to bring the total\nwater to 8,000 grams; the wet fiber was mixed in the\nsame manner as Example 1.\npressed in a 7 X 7 X 2% inches\nsame manner as in Example 1.\n300\xc2\xb0F per hour to 2350"F, held for 4 M hours lowered\n300" per hour to 1800\xc2\xb0F and the furnace was turned\noff. After cooling as in Example 1, the tile was 6%X 6%\nX 2% inches and was then machined to a 6 X 6 X 2\ninches final size.\nEXAMPLE 111\nA tile having a density of 12% pounds per cubic foot\nwas prepared which contained silicon crabide\nopacifier.\nOne thousand grams of Microquartz 108 fiber was\nwashed in 15 gallons of deionized water and 40-50 ml\nHCI and rinsed as in Example 1. In a separate vessel\n100 grams starch, 175 grams CAB-0-SIL M5 and 25\ngrams S i c (300 mesh) and 4 ml NH,OH in 300 grams\nof deionized water were mixed in a blender. The mixing\nwas continued for 4 minutes. The wet fiber and the\nbinder-opacifier slurry were placed in a stainless steel\n"intensifier" twin-shell V-blender having a one-cubicfoot capacity. Deionized water was added to bring the\ntotal up to 25,000 grams. The ingredients were mixed\nfor 45 minutes with the intensifier running on a 5minute-on, 5-minute-off cycle. The slurry was then\npressed in a 10%X 10% X 4 inches mold and dried as\nin Example 1. The tile\'was cured by placing the material in furnace and increasing the temperature by 200\xc2\xb0F\nper hour to 2350"F, holding for 2 hours, lowering 200"\nper hour to 1800\xc2\xb0F and turning the furnace off. When\nthe furnace had cooled to about 500"F, the tile was\nremoved. It was then machined to 9 X 9 X 3 inches.\n\n5\n\n3,952,083\n\n6\n\nof 95 to 98% by weight silica fibers and 2 to 5% by\nweight colloidal silica binder, and\n4. machining the tile to the desired dimensions.\n2.
