b'National\nAeronautics and\nSpace\nAdmin istration\n\nTee\n\nOperating just offshore from the St. Louis, Missouri, Gateway Arch Is\nFirefly I - a commercial mobile fireflghting module made possible by\nNASA developments in pumps for rocket engines, lightweight\nmaterials, and compact packaging. Completely self-contained, the\nmodule is transported by a barge fireboat, as shown here, or by a\npickup truck and trailer for fighting fires on land. [See the bottom of\npage At .]\n\nAbout the NASA\nTechnology Utilization Program\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which established NASA and\nthe United States civilian space program , requires that "The Adm inistration shall\nprovide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information\nconcerning its activities and the results thereof. "\nTo help carry out this objective , NASA\'s Technology Utilization (TU)\nProgram was established in 1962. Now, as an element of NASA\'s\nGovernment/Industry Affairs Division, this program offers a variety of\nvaluable services to help transfer aerospace technology to nonaerospace\napplications, thus assuring American taxpayers maximum return on their\ninvestment in space research; thousands of spinoffs of NASA research\nhave already occurred in virtually every area of our economy.\nThe TU program has worked for engineers, scientists, technicians , and\nbusinessmen ; and it can work for you .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs\n\nTech Briefs is published quarterly and is free to engineers in U.S. industry and\nto other domestic technology transfer agents . It is both a current-awareness\nmedium and a problem-solving tool . Potential products .. . industrial processes\n... basic and applied research . .. shop and lab techniques ... computer\nsoftware ... new sources of technical data .. . concepts . .. can be found\nhere . The short section on New Product Ideas highlights a few of the potential new\nproducts contained in this issue . The remainder of the volume is organized by\ntechnical category to help you quickly review new developments in your areas of\ninterest . Finally, a subject index makes each issue a convenient reference file .\n\nFurther Information\non Innovations\n\nAlthough some new technology announcements are complete in\nthemselves , most are backed up by Technical Support Packages (TSP\'s).\nTSP \'s are availabl e without charge and may be ordered by simply completing a TSP Request Card found at the back of this volume . Further information on some innovations is available for a nominal fee from other\nsources, as indicated . In addition, Technology Utilization Officers at NASA\nField Centers will often be able to lend necessary guidance and assistance .\n\nPatent Licenses\n\nPatents have been issued to NASA on some of the inventions described, and\npatent applications have been submitted on others. Each announcement indicates\npatent status and availabil ity of patent licenses if applicable .\n\nOther Technology\nUtilization Services\n\nTo assist engineers , industrial researchers, business executives,\nGovernment officials , and other potential users in applying space\ntechnology to their problems , NASA sponsors Industrial Applications\nCenters . Their services are described on page A7. In addition, an extensive\nlibrary of computer programs is available through COSMIC, the Technology\nUtilization Program \'s outlet for NASA-developed software .\n\nApplications Program\n\nNASA conducts applications engineering projects to help solve pUblic-sector\nproblems in such areas as safety, health , transportation, and environmental\nprotection. Two applications teams, staffed by professionals from a variety of\ndisciplines, assist in this effort by working with Federal agencies and health\norganizations to identify critical problems amenable to solution by the application\nof existing NASA technology .\n\nReader Feedback\n\nWe hope you find the information in NASA Tech Briefs useful. A\nreader-feedback card has been included because we want your comments and\nsuggestions on how we can further help you apply NASA innovations and\ntechnology to your needs .

The new torque brake\ncould help in the design of windmills\nand other rotating systems. The brake\nuses magnetic force to produce friction between a rotating part and a stationary part. The simulator produces a\nconstant torque, selectable between 0\nand 6 inch-pounds, for various flow\nfields and for rotation speeds from 20\nto 1,000 rpm . Output signals give a\nmeasure of torque and rotation speed.\n(See page 311 .)\n\nGage for Surface\nWaviness\n\nTile-Gap Measurement\nTool\n\nSurface irregularities are measured\nby noting readings of the three dial indicators on a simple, inexpensive\ngage. The new gage gives qualitative\nreadings of the flatness, curvature, or\nwaviness of a surface. It consists of a\nframe that is supported by two fixed\nfeet and one movable foot, plus the\nthree dial indicators, which can be\nlocated with various spacings in the\nframe . When the gage is applied to a\nsurface under test, the dial readings\nreveal any irregularities. As the device\nis moved about on the surface, the\ndials indicate any departure from true\nplanar contour.\n(See page 301.)\n\nOOllfOO_1NOo\nIINrOU!_\n... n\xc2\xa3lll.TAKING\n\nhard-steel snap-tool body such as that\nused to turn socket wrenches.

The new system allows\nfor the first time an in-depth study of\nthe effects of tail-fin spin rates on\n\nPrecise setting of gaps between tiles\nor other structures is possible with a\nnew hand-held too\\. Its measurements\nof small gaps between tiles, even when\nthe gap is tapered or indented below\nthe surface, are rapid and accurate\nwithin \xc2\xb1 0.003 inch. The tool consists\nof a flat blade on a shaft held by a\nknurled knob on a calibrated disk. The\ndisk indicates the gap dimensions. The\ndepth of the blade can be adjusted to\nmeasure progressively smaller or\nlarger depths in the gap; when the\nknob is loosened, the blade can be\nmoved from the shallow position to the\ndeep one.\n(See page 300.)\n\nCuff for Blood-Vessel\nPressure Measurements\nLong-term monitoring of the\npressure within a blood vessel is possible with a new noninvasive sensor .\nWithout penetrating the vessel or\n\n....essu...\nTRANSDUCER\n\nCROSS IECTlON\n\nA10\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nharming it, a cufflike device continuously monitors blood pressure for\nup to 6 months or longer.

The voltage regulator, besides furnishing a steady voltage to the transistor and unity-gain\nbuffer, reduces crosstalk from similar\ndevices connected to a common power\nsupply.\nIn a typical application, nine wideband amplifiers and an eight-way power\nsplitter are used to make an eight-output\ndistribution amplifier (Figure 2). As mentioned previously, this provides 90 to\n110 dB of isolation between user ports\n\nFor temperature stability, all circuit\ncomponents are contained in a closed\nmetal housing, and the packages of the\nactive circuit elements are embedded in\na common heat sink. These provisions\nnot only slow down the effect of ambient\ntemperature changes on individual\ndevices but also reduce temperature differences across devices so that differential temperature effects vanish.\nThe amplifier package consists of a\nvoltage regulator powering a driver transistor and an integrated-circuit unitygain buffer amplifier, coupled in a feedback circuit (Figure 1). The transistor\n\nA wideband amplifier, usable from\n30 kHz to 45 MHz is stable enough to\ndistribute the signal from an atomicfrequency standard, such as a hydrogen\nmaser, with negligible degradation of\nphase stability. For a 5-MHz signal, the\namplifier adds a tune jitter of less than\n5 x 10-14 s and has a phase delay that\nchanges by less than 1 x 10-12 s for a\n1 0 C change in ambient temperature or\na 1-V change in the power supply voltage.

Depending on amplitude taper, the number of elements, and design of the network, the\nrequired power-split ratio may not be the\nsame for all power dividers and may\nvary over a wide range of values.\nA simple technique for designing such\nstrip-line or microstrip power dividers\ncan be used for unequal, but inphase,\npower split. The technique allows power\nsplits ranging from equal to as large as\nrequired, with the advantage of using the\nsame line impedances and line spacings\nfor all splits. The output power ratio is\ndetermined by selecting the location of\nthe input port in a manner analogous to\nthe tap point for an electric-power\ntransformer.\nAlthough various couplers and dividers have been designed and implemented in strip line or microstrip for unequal\npower split, if the ratio of power split exceeds about 8 decibels, the narrow line\nwidths due to the required high line impedances are impractical to construct.\nFor power splits exceeding 10 decibels,\nside-coupled quarter-wave lines can be\nused, although they require multilayered\nconstruction. In a power distribution network that includes a wide range of\npower divisions, a variety of unequal\npower dividers, line widths, and line\nspacings may be required.\nIn the new technique, the unequal\npower split is obtained by exciting both\ninput ports of a quadrature hybrid with\nequal amplitudes but different phases.\nThe signals at the two output ports are\nthen the superposition of the response\nof the hybrid to two input signals. By\nproperly selecting the phase difference\nbetween the input signals, the signals\ncombine at the output ports so that the\noutput amplitude ratio can be any value\ndesired, while an inphase relationship is\nmaintained at the output.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nLINE LENGTHS\n\nc\n...--=-_.--_....:b\n=---_-.-_ _-o - _ _\nI\n\nP2\n\nb-a\nb\n\nb\n\n)./4\n\nPo\n\na\n\nL...--~L..---b\n--...J...---o\n\nc\n\n---..\n\nP,\n\nlINE IMPEDANCES\n\nZo\n\nZdV2\n\nZo\n\nPo\n\n\'ldv2\n\nZo\nZo\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nZo L...-_ _ L..-_ _ _ _L-_--o ______ P,\nZdV2\nZo\nZo\n\nA Simple-Tee Equal Power Divider is connected to the inputs of the hybrid by\nunequal line lengths to produce the phase difference at the inputs to the hybrid.\n\nFor the configuration shown in the figure, the ratio of the output power split is\ndetermined by the position of the input\nport. Since the power split depends only\non the ratio, alb, once the physical parameters (dielectric constant, dielectric\nthickness, line widths, and line lengths)\nhave been established for an equal\npower divider and a quadrature hybrid at\nthe design frequency, all unequal power\ndividers for a distribution network can be\ndesigned by simply selecting the proper\nlocation of the input tap point.\nThree experimental unequal power\nsplitters were fabricated in strip line output power ratios at 1,413 MHz of 0.5,\n0.25, and 0.1 (-3, -6, and -10 dB). A quarter-wave transformer was included in\nthe input line for impedance matching.\nAt the design frequency, the measured\npower split agrees with the design values within the accuracy of the network\nanalyzer system used to make the\nmeasurements. Although the power split\n\nand phase vary with frequency, the usable bandwidth is adequate for certain applications. For example, the frequency\nband 1,363 to 1,463 MHz has been\nallocated for an L-band radiometer\nphased array with a cosine distribution,\nwhich is currently being built. The\nSimplicity of the design of the unequal\npower splitter makes it attractive for\nsuch narrow-band phased\xc2\xb7array applications where a tapered-amplitude dis\xc2\xb7\ntribution is required for side\xc2\xb7lobe reduction .\nThis work was done by Marion C.\nBailey of Langley Research Center.\nFurther information may be found in\nNASA TM-81870 [N8D-31684INSP), "A\nSimple Stripline Design for Uneven\nPower Split" [$5].

The box accommodates more\nthan twice as many wires as previous\nboxes - 256 single contacts vs. 122in the same volume.\nLike previous " breakout " boxes, the\nnew box takes in wires via cable connectors and distributes them to contacts on the box face . Instead of separate insulated jacks in a metal face panel , the new box uses pairs of small military-standard metal sockets in a precision-drilled plastic panel (Figure 1). Although the contacts are packed much\nmore densely in the new box, they are\nclearly identified by number. They are\nalso identified with their cable connector by color - red stripes associate\nthe sockets from one of the connectors,\nand black associates those from the\nother.\nBefore a socket is assembled on the\npanel, a wire is crimped on its pin . The\nwire and its socket are inserted in a hole\nin the faceplate , and the socket is\npressed into place. The unattached end\nof each wire is then crimped on the proper pin of one of the two 128-pin connectors mounted on the end of the box.\nA shorting plug (Figure 2) provides\ncontinuity for wires when they are not\nbeing tested . The shorting plug connects the two members of a socket contact pair. It also includes a socket for a\ntest probe. Thus, the complete wiring\njoined by a socket pair can be tested\nwithout removal of the shorting plug.\nThis work was done by Wallace B.\nPierce and Walter G.

These circuits prevent the\ndirect current and consequent motor\nheating that would normally result from\nthe failure of a solid-state switch in the\ncontroller.\nSwitch failure modes include a short\ncircuit or an open circuit in one direc\xc2\xb7\ntion only. In either case, the resulting\nunbalanced waveform includes a\nsteady-state component that may\ncause the motor to overheat. One of the\nnew circuits turns the switch (a Triac, or\nequivalent, switch) fully on in both directions if it detects a short in either direction . Another circuit turns the switch off\nif it detects an open in either direction.\nIn either case, balance is restored.\nThe Single-phase power-factor controller of Figure 1 is equipped with a\nshort detector , shown within the\ndashed line. The combination of R1 and\nC1 acts as a low-pass filter. Amplifier A1\n\'OK\n3W\n\n3W\n\nadditional circuit is needed to apply the\ncorrective measure . Because the\nswitch will not respond to the turn-on\ncurrent in the direction of open-circuit\nfailure, V3 remains at about + 10 V.\nAs shown in Figure 2, V3 is fed to lowpass filter R20C20, the time constant of\nwhich is 1 to 2 seconds, about 20 times\nthat of R1C1 . If V3 remains at + 10 V,\nindicating an open-circuit failure, then it\nwill survive the delay of R20~0 and trip\ncomparator A1 O. The output of A1 0 then\nswings fully positive ( + 15 V). This pOSitive voltage is fed through resistor R24,\nwhich equals the gate-current-limiting\nresistor R26. Thus, the negative voltage\nfrom comparator A2 is balanced, the\nnet voltage at the switch gate is essentially zero, and the switch turns off. The\ncombination of D21 and R24 latches\nA10 in the positive-output state until the\npower is removed. When power is applied to the repaired circuit, charging\ncurrent through C21 insures that A10\n\nNOTES.\n- Pow.r Triac: .wlICI\'I reQulr. .

In normal operation,\nthe switch voltage is symmetrical, and\nthe output voltage V1 of R1C1 is near\nzero.\nIf the switch shorts in either the\npositive or negative direction, V1 departs from zero, resulting in V3\n= + IV 11== 10 volts at the input of comparator A2. A2 then switches to its full\nnegative output ( - 15 V), causing gate\ncurrent for the switch to flow through resistor RS, thus holding the switch fully\non in both directions. The values of R4,\nR5, and R6 are so chosen that A2 remains latched in the negative-output\ncondition until the power is turned off.\n(Therefore full power is applied to the\nmotor until then.) The positive charging\ncurrent through C2 assures that A2\ngoes into the positive-output state when\npower is restored to the repaired circuit.\nUnbalance due to an open circuit\nalso trips comparator A2.

The lamp current is\nswitched between these two modes by a\ntransistor; the transistor is therefore\ncalled a current-mode switch.\nThe active lamp-pulse driver circuit is\nshown in the figure. The small dc power\nsupply keeps capacitor C1 charged and\nmaintains a partially-ionizing simmer\ncurrent flowing in the lamp, once the\nlamp has been ignited. When the transistor is turned on , it allows a high current\nto flow during an incomplete discharge\nof C1 . The monostable multivibrator sets\nthe pulse interval by applying voltage to\nthe non inverting terminal of the basedrive amplifier. A tap on emitter resistor\nR2 delivers a feedback signal to the inverting terminal of the amplifier, thereby\ncontrolling the amplitude of the current\nduring the pulse.\nA flash-time interval greater than 100\nmicroseconds is usually necessary to\ngive adequate damping time to relaxation oscillations in the laser being\npumped. The typical drive-current pulse\nis approximately 350 microseconds long\nand transfers an instantaneous power of\nabout 120 kilowatts to the flashlamp.\nThe duty cycle is 0.1 percent.\nNASA Tech Briefs, FallIWlnter 1981\n\nc1\n400V@300W\nFROM\nde POWER SUPPLY\n\nIGNITION\nVOLTAGE\n\n\xc2\xb1o-y\n-30kV\n\n(LAMP\xc2\xb7\nENERGY\n\n+ ( STIAGE)\n\n~\n\n/"""I\n\nLAMP\n\nSIMMER\xc2\xb7\n\'--"IIV\'r---, CURRENT\nPATH\nCR\n\nFLASH\nCOMMAND\n\n..J\n\nL\nCURRENT\xc2\xb7MODE\nSWITCH\nMONOSTABLE\n\n-= MULTIVIBRATOR\nCURRENT SENSE\nCONSTANT-CURRENT\nVOLTAGE FEEDBACK\n\nStable Light Pulses are emitted from the flash lamp when the monos table multivibrator\ngoes high, in part because the unsaturated transistor switch has a negative feedback\ncontrol that keeps the lamp current constant.\n\nThis work was done by K.

If for example, e = 1.9, then the effective load\nresistance is increased to 10R, which\nmultiplies the first-stage gain to 10 times\nits unloaded value.\nSince the operational-amplifier-stage\ngain equals 1 + e, the overall gain at\nresonance is given by\n\nc\n\nThe Low\xc2\xb7Nolse Band\xc2\xb7Pass Amplifier employs a J FET and an operational amplifier. A high\ngain and a band-pass characteristic are achieved with a suitable choice of the\nresistances and capacitances.\n\nA conventional junction-field-effecttransistor (JFET) amplifier is ac-coupled\nto the noninverting input of an operational amplifier in such a manner that the\ninput impedance of the latter includes\nnegative resistance and inductive and\ncapacitive reactance. The net effect is a\nhigh first-stage gain with a band-pass\ncharacteristic ; that is, a simulated LC\nresonance condition.\nThe equivalent first-stage input noise\nvoltage, Ein, of a two-stage amplifier is\ngiven by\nE?\n\nIn\n\n=E2+E2 /k2\n1\n2\n\n=\n\nwhere E1\nfirst-stage input noise voltage, E2\nsecond-stage input noise\nvoltage gain of the\nvoltage, and k\nfirst stage. If the second-stage noise is\nlarge, then a high first-stage gain is\nnecessary to minimize its effect.\nThe low-noise condition in a JFET\nusually requires a large quiescent current. In turn , this requires a small load\nresistor, resulting, in practice, in a\n\n=\n\n254\n\n=\n\nvoltage gain of about 7 to 10. But a\nfirst- stage gain of 50 to 100 is required\nin the presence of a noisy second stage.\nAt resonance, the circuit shown in the\nfigure effectively places a negative\nresistance in parallel with the first-stage\nload resistor, RL, with a magnitude\nslightly larger than RL. The resistance of\nthe parallel combination is considerably\ngreater than RL, resulting in increased\nfirst-stage gain.\nA straightforward analysis yields an\nexpression for the total admittance (including the operational-amplifier-stage\ndriving-point admittance) seen by the\ndrain of the JFET:\n\ny=~1 R\n\nR\ne\nR2+_1_\n\n.+\nJ\n\nw2c2\n\nt\n\nj wC-\n\nelwC\n\n2\n1\nR +--\n\n(e - 1)V2\nRC\n\n]\n\nKv:::: gm R (1\n2 - e\n\n+ e)\n\nwhere gm = the JFET transconductance, and its drain resistance is considered to be very large.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA hybrid switch allows high-power\ndirect current to be turned on and off\nwithout arcing or erosion. The switch\nconsists of a bank of transistors in parallel with mechanical contacts . The\ntransistor bank makes and breaks the\nswitched circuit; the contacts carry\ncurrent only during the steady-state\n" on" condition.\nOriginally designed for the Space\nShuttle orbiter, the hybrid switch can\nbe used also in high-power control circuits in aircraft, electric autos, industrial furnaces , and solar-cell arrays. With\nits arc-free closure, the device could\nalso be operated in potentially explosive\natmospheres. The switch operates at a\nmaximum of 330 Vdc, in versions with\ncurrent ratings of 100, 300, 500, 600,\n1,000, and 1.500 Adc.\nTo close the hybrid switch, an operator sets a switch on a control panel to\nthe " close" position (see figure). This\nactuates a motor, which moves a set of\ncontacts, 81, together . 81 , designed for\nlow current and voltage, energizes a\ndcldc converter, which biases the transistor bank into saturation. The transistors then apply 270 Vdc power to the\nload. About 10 milliseconds later, the\nmotor closes a second set of contacts,\n82, designed for high current and voltage. 82 short-circuits the transistors\nand carries the full current load. When\nthe motor has closed S2, it is turned off\nautomatically. The dcldc converter remains energized because 81 stays\nclosed. The power drawn by the converter is less than 2 watts.\nTo open the hybrid switch , the\noperator sets the control panel switch\nto \' \'open. " The motor opens S2, and the\ntransistors again furnish power to the\nload since the transistor bank has been\nkept fully saturated by the converter.\nAbout 10 milliseconds after S2 opens,\nthe motor opens 81 . The transistor bank\nis then deenergized, and no further\npower is delivered to the load.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWinter 1981\n\nCONTROL\nPANEL\n\nr - -~E\'\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n.-------------,\nI\nT 52 r - - -0- 2- - - - - - + - .

Contacts S1 energize the MOSFET bank for a brief\nperiod before S2 closes and after S2 opens. The power contacts are therefore never\nsubjected to arcs when they are joined or separated . The 1,500-A version of the switch\nmeasures 7-% by 15 by 10 inches (19 by 38.1 by 25.4 cm).\n\nThe transistor bank is composed of\nparallel groups of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors\n(M08FET\'s). With these devices, the\nauxiliary circuitry is simpler than if\nbipolar transistors were used. The\nMOSFET\'sfor this application must\nhave a drain-to\xc2\xb7source voltage rating of\n400 V and a drain-current rating of 11 A.\n" On " resistance must be low - less\nthan about 0.3 Q. Each parallel group of\nM08FET\'s contains up to six transistors\n(adding more than six devices to the\ngroup makes it difficult to balance the\ndrain-current distribution among the\nmembers). A 100-A switch contains 12\nM08FET\'s divided into two groups. A\n1,500-A switch contains 150 M08FET\'s\ndivided among 25 groups.\nA series diode, 0" protects the transistor bank from negative transient voltages and positive reverse currents from\nthe bus while the bank is deenergized.\n0, is reverse-biased by output transient\n\nvoltages greater than the battery voltage.

When such a transient occurs,\n02 conducts and creates a voltage drop\nacross R1 that turns on the transistor\nbank. The voltage drop from drain to\nsource of the parallel transistors is\nthereby reduced, and damage to them\nis prevented. Although the transient is\npassed on to the load, it is ordinarily so\nshort - 100!-lS long at most - that only\nminimal voltage is developed across\nthe load.\nThis work was done by Wilson N.\nMiller and Ormal E.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\n96 MOSFET\'s\nIN PARALLEL\n\n+27.5 V TO\nSOURCE\n~--4..-.------------------4---o +32.2S\xc2\xb1O.2S V\nMAIN de BUS\n\n.......\n\n+52V\n\n5-V\nREFERENCE\n\nNinety-six Parallel MOSFET Devices with a two-stage feedback circuit form a high-current dc voltage regulator that also acts as a\nfully-on solid-state switch when fuel-cell output falls below the regulated Voltage. Ripple voltage is less than 20 mV, and transient\nrecovery time is less than 50 ms.\n\nA high-current voltage regulator\nbased on metal-oxide-semiconductor\nfield-effect transistors (MOSFET\'s) is\nhighly efficient, dissipating only 115\nwatts of power at a current output of 450\namperes. The control element is a parallel combination of 96 MOSFET devices,\nwhich thus act as though they have a\nsingle source, gate, and drain. Developed to regulate the output of fuel cells\non board the Space Shuttle, the\nMOSFET regulator can be used wherever large direct currents must be controlled. It can be applied, for example, to\ninverters , industrial furnances, photovoltaic solar generators, dc motors, and\nelectric autos.\nMOSFET\'s have a positive temperature coefficient of resistance; thus as\nthe internal temperature of a single device rises because of increased current,\ninternal resistance also rises, tending to\nlimit the current and to divert it to other\nMOSFET\'s in the parallel combination. A\nbipolar transistor with its negative coeffi-\n\n256\n\ncient behaves in just the opposite way,\ntending to draw more current as its\ntemperature rises. The MOSFET regulator is therefore not subject to the current\nrunaway that can lead to catastrophic\nfailure in overloaded bipolar regulators.\nThe MOSFET\'s are the series element\nin a series static regulator (see figure),\nwhich maintains the main dc bus at\n32.25 \xc2\xb1 0.25 volts when the fuel-cell output exceeds 32 volts. When the regulator is in the active range (fuel-cell voltage\nin excess of 32 volts), the MOSFET output (source) voltage is compared with a\nreference voltage. The difference is\nampl ified by A 1 and A2 and presented as\nan error signal at the gate of the\nMOSFET\'s. A 20-V dc-to-dc converter,\npowered by the fuel cell , provides the\nnecessary turn-on bias for the\nMOSFET\'s and the operating voltage for\nA2. An 18-V Zener diode provides the\noperating voltage for A1 ; the 26-V Zener\noffsets the return voltage of A2 so that\nthat amplifier operates at a reasonable\n\nlevel. Protection against lightning-induced voltage transients as high as 96 V\nis furnished by the 18-V Zener across\nA1 \xc2\xb7\nThe fuel-cell output can range from\n27.5 to 38 Vdc. When the fuel-cell voltage drops below 32 V, the MOSFET\'s\nact as a fully-saturated, turned-on solidstate switch.\nThe normal operating-current range\nis 50 to 450 A. The regulator can carry\nabnormally high currents for short\nperiods (until fault-isolating fuses blow)\nwithout being damaged. For example, it\ncan carry 1,000 A for 60 s (570 W dissipation) and 4,000 A for 400 ms (9,120 W\ndissipation). The final temperature of\neach MOSFET does not exceed\n104.3\xc2\xb0 C for the 4,000-A fault.\nThis work was done by Wilson N.\nMiller and Ormal E.

Clusters of 16\nmodules delivering about 50 watts of\ntransmitter power would be arranged in\na phased array controlled from a single\nsource.\nOf the two designs, one is a high-Q circuit that is efficient but mechanically\ncomplex, while the other is simpler but\nless efficient. In either case, the anticipated mass is less than 1 gram per watt.\nIn the high-Q design, the antenna elements are printed on a 3-mil (0.08-mm)\nsheet (Kapton\xc2\xae , or equivalent) spaced\none-quarter wavelength away from the\nmetalized back surface of the solar-cell\nblanket. Each amplifier uses lumpedelement circuits and " bump" -mounted\nGaAs FET\'s, all on a 0.5- by 1-cm sapphire substrate . The modules are fed by\nbalanced lines from the receiver and are\nsupplied with dc power by feedlines extending across the space from the solar\nblanket to the antenna sheet.\nThe alternative concept calls for a\nplastic grid, 20 mils (0.5 mm) thiCk, between the solar blanket and the antenna\nelements.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nThe launch-processing system for the\nSpace Shuttle uses a master console\nand operations consoles at many different locations. All of the consoles interface with front-end data processors and\na processed-data recorder through a\ncommon data buffer (see figure). This\nentire system for the checkout, control ,\nand monitoring of a launch is tested with\njust two computer programs.\nThe first program, which is executed\nin the master console, synchronizes test\ninitiation in the operations consoles and\nalso controls test duration . In addition, it\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWinter 1981\n\nmonitors the " up" or " down" status of\neach operations console.\nThe second program controls the execution in an operations console. An important feature of this program is a\nscheduler with directory of five subprograms that communicate with or process data from a particular front-end\nprocessor (FEP). The scheduler initiates\nthree of these subprograms; and when\none terminates, another is called. Thus\nthree of the five subprograms are active\nat all times. Using this technique, each\noperations console communicates with\n\na different set of FEP\'s at any given time.\nSoftware interrupts facilitate the communications between the scheduler and\nactive tasks . Each task is assigned a\nunique interrupt; and when the task\nterminates, the interrupt is sent to the\nscheduler. The scheduler then initiates\nanother task.\nThe second program monitors the\ncountdown clock and begins initiating\ntasks when the status changes from\nHold to Count. A countdown time of zero\nterminates the test.\n(continued on next page)\n\n263\n\n,...\n...\n~\n\nThe operations consoles all have copies of the second program. These copies\nare identical except for the program directory and the discretes used for communicating with the master console.\nTo execute a test, the control program is called in each operations console. The operator then calls the monitor\nprogram from the master console. Keyboard commands set the countdown\ntime to a value that represents test duration and start the countdown clock. The\ncontrol program in each operations console detects the change in status and\nbegins task initiation. All of the front-end\nprocessors are exercised from the consoles through the common data buffer,\nand all data are logged to the processeddata recorder for posttest analysis.\nThis work was done by R. Edstrom\nand O. Kleckner of IBM Corp. for\nKennedy Space Center.

Since input commands do not affect closed-loop stability, the input com\xc2\xb7\nmands are nulled for the purpose of\nstability analysis.\n\n264\n\nother. The method is called Multirate\nMatrix Frequency Response (MMFR)\nanalysis.\nMMFR was used io the Space Shuttle\nto evaluate the effect of decreasing the\nsample rate of the an error loop in the\nascent-phase digital autopilot. It should\nalso be useful to designers of other control systems and to structural, civil, and\nmechanical engineers for structure and\nvibration analysis.\nOne of the forerunners of MMFR was\na method of open-lOOp frequencyresponse analysis known as the Generalized Determinant Expansion Routine\n(GDER). The latter can expand a large\ndeterminant with elements composed of\npolynomials in Laplace transform\noperator form and can correctly determine the coefficient of the highest order\nterm . Dynamic equations of the plant\nand the control equations necessary to\nclose the control loops (see figure) are\nplaced in the GDER determinant. The\neigenvalues resulting from the expansion determine the total system stability.\n\nA refinement of GDER resulted in the\nimmediate predecessor of MMFR, a program known as Matrix Frequency Response (MFR). A somewhat more direct\napproach than GDER, MFR made substitution of a complex variable the first\nstep in the frequency-response calculation process. Improved computer\nspeeds and the development of an innovative determinant expansion routine\nmade this approach possible.\nIn MMFR, a Z-transform frequency\ndecomposition technique is used to reduce a multirate system to an equivalent\nSingle-rate system that operates at the\nfaster (or fastest) sample rate. The resulting model is then analyzed by GDER\nand MFR techniques. Sample-rate ratios\nother than 2:1 can be accommodated by\nMMFR, though additional complexity is\nthereby introduced.\nThis work was done by Neal Hendrix\nof Marshall Space Flight Center.

At\neach step, energy is lost, yielding an\noverall efficiency of about 35 percent.\nMHO generators, on the other hand, produce electricity directly from a moving\nsubstance such as a plasma or liquid\nmetal, resulting in efficiencies as high\nas 50 to 60 percent. This high efficiency suggests that magnetohydrodynamics may be an excellent way to produce electric power from solar energy.\nTechniques for producing electric\npower from solar energy include solar\ncells , thermoelectric methods, and\nplasma MHO generators. In addition,\nliquid-metal MHO generators driven by\nenergy sources other than solar have\nbeen considered. Plasma MHO generators operated at temperatures greater\nthan 2,000 K are highly-efficient electric\npower producers. However, continuous\noperation at such high temperatures results in severe material problems that\nare yet to be solved. For example, the\nmaximum duty cycle tested for a hightemperature plasma MHO generator\nlasted only a few days with coal gas as\nthe working fluid. A liquid-metal MHO\ngenerator proposed at NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory is driven by a nuclear reactor and uses cesium and lithium as the working fluids. At the Argonne\nNational Laboratory, a NaK-N2 liquidmetal MHO generator was developed\nwith an estimated efficiency of greater\nthan 50 percent at 1,500 K. Various heat\nsources were considered , but solar\nenergy was not included.\nA solar-powered liquid-metal MHO\ngenerator proposed at Langley Research Center focuses solar radiation\n\n268\n\nSOLAR\nCOLLECTOR\n\nSolar MHO Generator focuses radiation from the Sun to heat a driving gas that pushes a\nliquid metal past a magnetic coil (not shown above). Power is extracted directly from the\nelectric currents set up in the conducting liquid.\n\nthrough a transparent window and into a\nsolar oven. The window is cooled and\nkept clean by an inert working gas such\nas helium or argon.\nIn the oven, solar radiation heats the\nworking gas, which is also compressed\nby the conical shape of the oven. As the\nliquid metal is injected into the oven, it\ntoo is heated, and it is mixed with the\ndriving gas. In the mixing area the solar\nradiation is most concentrated, and the\ntwo-phase working fluid is hottest.\nAs the two-phase fluid flows through\nthe MHO channel, electricity is generated. Surrounded by a magnet and\npower-conditioning unit not shown in the\nfigure, the channel acts as turbine and\ngenerator: The gas drives the liquid\nmetal across the magnetic field and\nthereby generates the electric power.\nSince the liquid metal has a high heat\ncapacity, it acts as a large heat source\nfor the gas, and the gas expands at an\nalmost-constant temperature. Most of\nthe enthalpy change in the generator\ndepends on the liquid.\nThe gas is separated from the mixture\nin the separator/diffuser and is recouped\nin the regenerative heat exchanger. The\ngas is then returned to the solar oven by\n\nway of the radiator and compressor. The\nliquid metal is pumped back into the\nmixer.\nAn alternative to the directly-heated\nsolar oven is a heat exchanger similar to\nthat used for a coal-fired liquid-metal\nMHO generator. In this case the solar\nradiation is directed to an absorbing\nmaterial such as graphite in which a\nheat exchanger is enclosed or to an\nensemble of heat-exhanging pipes with\nmultiple fins made of absorbing\nmaterial.\nThis system was first conceived for\nuse in space. Using solar energy as a\nfuel can save considerable costs and\npayload weight, compared to previous\nsystems. The system could, of course,\nbe adapted for use on Earth. Its principal\nadvantages are that the basic technology exists, that near-term application\ncan be expected, and that it could\nachieve an efficiency of up to 55 percent. Other methods including plasma\nMHO generators still require breakthroughs in materials and component\ndevelopment.\n\nThis work was done by Frank Hoh/ of\nLangley Research Center and Ja H.\n\nLee of Vanderbuilt University.

The new unit has the same high\nspatial resolution as the original version.\nThe previous Lixiscope is described in\n"Low-Intensity X-Ray and Gamma-Ray\nImaging Device," on page 67 of NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 3, NO.1. It is\nused with or without an attached radiation source in several radiographic applications, including medical diagnostics.\nThe new unit, with its higher energy\nresolution, is intended for X-ray astronomy, although it could be applied terrestrially wherever a sensitive portable radiation spectrometer is required for the\n2Cl-to-2()(}keV range.\nAs shown in the illustration of the Lixiscope, the incident photons pass\nthrough a shield opaque to visible light\nbut transparent to X-rays and gamma\nrays. They strike a scintillator that converts them into visible-light photons. The\nvisible-light image is then coupled byoptical fibers to an image intensifier, which\nproduces an electron image. Finally, the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nelectron image is impressed on an\naluminized phosphor at the output\nfaceplate, which displays the muchintensified visible image.\nSignificant improvements have been\nmade in the image-intensifier section.\nPreviously, a conventional single-channel microchannel-plate (MCP) amplifier\nwith a peak gain of about 104 was used.\nIon feedback prevented the realization\nof the higher gain (about 107) needed for\nSingle-photon counting.\nThe new unit uses a dual, triple, or\ncurved microchannel-plate amplifier.\nThe dual, triple, or curved MCP\'s\neliminate the ion-feedback problem. The\nmicrochannels are 12 microns In diameter with a total length-to-diameter ratio\nof approximately 100: 1. Since electron\nmultiplications are confined to these\nnarrow channels, image information is\npreserved during the intensification process. For single-photon counting, Nal ,\nCsl, or other fast-decay phosphors can\nbe used as input scintilla tors.\nWhen the multiple or curved MCP\namplifier is operated at saturation, the\ngain for a single-electron input is about\n107. However, since tens to thousands\n\nof simultaneous photocathode electrons\nare produced by each gamma ray, it is\nnecessary to operate below saturation\nto stay below the charge limitation of the\namplifier.\nNonetheless, the multiple or curved\nMCP amplifier operated below saturation has essentially the same gain\ncharacteristic for multiple-electron Inputs that it does in the saturated mode\nfor a Single-electron input. This is a result\nof the statistics associated with large\nnumbers of photoelectrons. Thus even\nwhen operated below saturation to prevent charge overload, the dual MCP\namplifier has sufficiently high gain to\nallow single-photon counting and to give\nenergy resolution .\nThis work was done by Lo I Yin of\nGoddard Space Flight Center.

Because of the\npossibility of extended periods of bad\nweather, a full-sized conventional heating system is required as a backup to the\nsolar heating system.\nThe question of whether to spend the\nextra money depends on how much the\nsystem will save and how long it will take\nto obtain those savings. The SHCOST\n\n274\n\ncomputer program helps to answer\nthese questions by assessing the economic feasibility of solar energy for\nsingle-family residences and light commercial applications.\nThere are several important economic considerations in "sizing" a solar\nheating system. "Sizing" means selecting a collector area and a collector performance and then determining the percentage of the annual energy load that\ncan be provided by solar energy. As the\ncollector area increases, the solarenergy system carries a greater percentage of the annual load. For low collector areas, not much Sunlight is captured and, hence, little heat is supplied.\nA relatively large amount of money is invested to displace a small amount of\nconventional heating. At high collector\nareas a similar cost phenomena occurs.\nAdding collector area when it is already\nhigh provides only a very small increase\nin the percentage of the total load carried by the solar-energy system.\nUsing classic life-cycle costing techniques, the collector area that minimizes\nthe life-cycle cost of the system can be\ncomputed. From an economic standpoint, however, this may not be the most\nattractively-sized solar-energy system to\nthe homeowner or for a light commercial application. Homeowners are usually more interested in a lower initial cost,\nfewer years to positive cash flow, fewer\nyears to recover downpayment, and a\nshorter payback period than are determined in a classic minimum-life-cycle\ncost analysis.\n\nSHCOST analyzes life-cycle costs as\nwell as sensitivity studies to aid the\ndesigner in selecting the most economically attractive solar system for a singlefamily residence or a light commercial\napplication. SHCOST includes a fairly\ncomprehensive list of cost elements\nfrom which the user may select. It is\nassumed that the total heating load has\nbeen determined. Starting with an initial\ncollector area and performance characteristics, the GFL method is used to\ndetermine the percentage of the heating\nload carried by the solar system.\nSHCOST studies a range of values of\ncertain parameters. The parameters\nthat may be varied are collector area,\ndiscount rate, inflation rate, down payment factor, property-tax rate, and\nincome-tax rate. The output consists of\ntabular data on the sizing parameters\nand the sensitivity studies. Plotter output\nmay be generated for the annual cash\nflow results and for the life-cycle cost as\na function of any of the sensitivity\nanalysis parameters.\nSHCOST is written in ASCII FORTRAN\nfor batch execution and has been implemented on a UNIVAC 1100 series computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 25K of 36-bit\nwords. For plotter output, a Cal-Comp\nplotting system or equivalent is required.\nSHCOST was developed in 1979.\n\nThis program was written by J. Alan\nForney of Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

Therefore their use has been\nlimited to service as an extruder or filler\nrather than as a reinforcing agent.\nThe surface condition of sprayed\ncoal is different from that obtained by\ngrinding, however. The cooling and fixing of the surface during spray\natomization of plastic coal can take\nplace in oxidizing, neutral, or reducing\natmospheres, with either fast or slow\nquenching .\n\nBecause carbon blacks behave differently in different elastomers, it is\nsuggested that three typical rubbers be\nused in evaluating the coal substitutes\n(see table). Five carbon blacks and\ncoals would be used. The compounded\nelastomers would be molded into a\nsheet during vulcanization .

Such\na model will help in determining the\npreferred frequency range and sensing\ntechniques. The generator can be used\nin the measurement of such properties\nas sound speed, attenuation rate,\ncharacteristic impedance, and the\nrelationship of these properties to the\nstructure and composition of coal.\nThe sound generator produces two\nbursts of identical sinusoidal waveform\nwith an adjustable separation between\nthe starting times of the bursts.

The frequency of the sine waves is adjustable up to\n500 kHz. The delay between bursts in\nthe two channels can be varied from\none-tenth to 100 periods of a sinusoid.\nThe main components are:\n- A clock, which produces the master\nfrequency;\n\n- Two basic sine-wave generators (one\nfor each channel) - each generator\ncontains a five-flip-flop walking-ring\ncounter and an amplifier; and the\nphase-shifted flip-flop outputs are\nsummed to build up a rising and falling\nstep-function wave, which after being\nfiltered becomes a sine wave;\n- Burst counters, which allow an adjustable number of trigger pulses to pass to\nthe sine-wave generators so that each\ngenerator produces the desired number of sinusoids for each burst; and\nNASA Tech Briefs, FallIWlnter 1981\n\n-A delay counter, which starts the second burst counter and its sine-wave\ngenerator after an adjustable number\nof master clock pulses.\nThe sound transducers for the coal\nmeasurements operate at 100 to 200\nvolts peak-to-peak and present a largely\ncapacitive load. On the other hand, the\nsine-wave outputs come from CMOS operational amplifiers, which are low-output-impedance devices with 10-volt\n\npeak-to-peak output voltage. A buffer circuit with a step-up transformer matches\nthe source to the load.\nBecause the generator produces two\nsound bursts with a controllable delay\nbetween them, it can be used for echocancellation measurements. The coal\nspecimen is placed in a water medium\nbetween two transducers (see figure).\nOne sine-wave channel is applied to the\nleft transducer, and the other channel is\n\napplied to the right transducer.

XP8 is an analytical\ntechnique for understanding the electronic structure of atoms close to the\nsurface in solids, in preference to the\nbulk structure of the material. The study\nfound evidence for core-level chemical\nshifts arising from changes in the local\nstructural environment in amorphous\n8i02 (a-8i02, and at the Si/8i02 interface.\nThe experimental studies were conducted employing a modified commercial spectrometer.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn iodine-dispensing resin can be regenerated after its iodine content has\nbeen depleted, without being removed\nfrom the water system. The resin is\nused to make water potable by killing\nbacteria, fungi, and viruses. [See also\nthe related article "Improved MicrobialCheck-Valve Resins" (MSC-18377) in\nVol. 4, NO.3 of NASA Tech Briefs, page\n392.]\nThe regeneration technique may become the basis of a water purifier for\nvery long space missions. Enough crystalline iodine for multiple regenerations\nduring a mission can be stored in one\nsmall cartridge. The cartridge could be\ninserted in a waterline as necessary on\nsignal from an iodine monitor or a timer.\nThe convenience of regenerating the\nresin without removing it from the water\nsystem will be attractive in terrestrial\napplications as well.\nWater flowing through the iodine crystals in the cartridge carries iodine to the\nresin, where iodine accumulates. When\nthe depleted iodine in the resin has been\nreplaced, the cartridge is removed.\nExperiments have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the regeneration method. For example, an iodine bed that had\nbeen washed until it produced only 40\nparts per million of 12 in effluent water\nwas installed in a waterline containing a\nresin bed. The iodine bed remained in\nthe line until the effluent water from the\nresin bed had built up to 1.8 ppm 12 (see\nfigure), at which point it was removed.\nThe effluent from the resin bed immediately dropped below 1 ppm and\ngradually declined to 0.2 ppm.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\n4.-----------.-----------.-----------~--._,-----~\n\n3\n\n12 SOURCE:\n63 ppm,\n4 HOURS\n\nE\n\nC>\nC>\n\n5"\n\no\n\n2\n\n.!"\n\nOL---------~100~----------~~----------~300~-330~~~-----400~\n\nTIME IN HOURS\n\nThe Temporary Insertion of an Iodine Bed in a waterflow line (Indicated by spikes) quickly\nregenerates a resin bed. The resin is a commercially-available quaternary ammonium ionexchange resin.\n\nNext, a somewhat more-potent iodine\nbed was installed - one that produced\nan effluent containing 63 ppm 12. The\nnew iodine bed was removed when the\nresin bed effluent had risen to a concentration of 3 ppm 12. The resin effluent immediately dropped\nto 2 ppm and\ngradually declined to 1 ppm. (An 12 concentration of about 2 ppm is considered\nboth microbicidal and taste-free.)\nAt that point, a fresh bed of iodine\ncrystals, producing 98 ppm 12 in its effluent, was installed. The resin effluent\nclimbed to 4 ppm in only an hour, when\nthe iodine bed was removed. The resin\neffluent immediately dropped to 1.2\nppm, then gradually dropped to 1 ppm.\nFinally, a 55-ppm-effluent iodine bed\nwas installed. The resin effluent rose im-\n\nmediately to 3 ppm but quickly returned\nto 2 ppm, where it remained for 4 hours.\nThe iodine bed was removed, and water\nwas circulated through the resin bed\novernight. In the morning, the resin effluent concentration was 1.6 ppm.\nThe sharp rise in resin effluent concentration that occurs when the iodine\nbed is first connected is not expected to\nbe a problem. Most purifiers feed a\nstorage tank with a volume that will\ndilute the iodine content to acceptably\nlow levels.\nThis work was done by Gerald V.\nColombo and David F.

The end result is neutral substituted urea.\n\n284\n\nUnreacted amine curing agents and\namine functional groups remain on the\nresin surface after curing . Aliphatic\namines are particular offenders. Moisture and carbon dioxide in the air hinder\nthe cure at the surface, allowing unreacted groups to form. Nevertheless, aliphatic amines are favored because they\nreact at room temperature and cure\nfast. Aromatic amines, in contrast, do\nnot form a corrosive layer; they do not\nreact significantly with carbon dioxide or\nwater. However, they need high temperature to cure epoxies.\nThe new surface treatment is a rapid,\nconvenient, and effective method for\nconverting unused amines and amine\nfunctional groups into neutral, noncorrosive substituted urea. The reaction pro-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nceeds at room temperature, takes only a\nfew minutes, and leaves no corrosive\nresidue.\nFor best results, the surface should\nfirst be washed with alcohol to remove\nas much as possible of the unreacted\namine. Then it should be dried, since\nresidual moisture or alcohol may consume some of the treatment reagent,\nand neutralization may then be incomplete.\nThe reagent, a mono-isocyanate or a\nmono-isothiocyanate, is brushed on the\ncured epoxy surface. The preferred\nreagent is 1-naphthyl isocyanate\nbecause it has a low vapor pressure,\nand its vapor is less irritating than that of\nother reagents. The isocyanate group on\n\nthe 1-naphthyl isocyanate molecule\nreacts with the unused amines and\namine groups on the surface, rendering\nthem neutral (see figure).\nAn excess of reagent should be used.\nIt should be brush-mixed once or twice\nwhile it is reacting. Finally, the surface\nshould be rinsed with acetone followed\nby alcohol. Rinse waste should be collected in one receptacle so that the alcohol can destroy the cyanate.\nThe isocyanate treatment is more effective than previous methods of reducing surface corrosiveness. For example,\nrinsing with a solvent cannot completely\nremove unreacted amine groups because they may be bonded at one end of\nthe molecule to the base material.\n\nReducing the amine content helps little\nbecause there will still be unreacted\ngroups on the surface. Sanding or\nabrading removes the surface layer, but\noften is not practical. Curing in dry air or\nan inert atmosphere reduces surface\nalkalinity but usually not enough.\nThis work was done by Sheng Y Lee\n.\nof Goddard Space Flight Center.

The most promising candidates\nare perfluoropropylene oxide polymers\nwith a degree of polymerization (OP) between 10 and SO. It is desirable to have\nthe OP in the high range because the vapor pressure of the material decreases\nas the OP increases, and hence the\nhigh-OP liquids have lower loss due to\nvaporization (see figure).\nIn some thermochemical cycles for\nhydrogen production, the oxygen release step is the thermal decomposition\nof sulfuric acid. To vaporize the H2SO4\nat 330 0 C, it can be mixed with an immiscible nonreactive hot liquid. The liquid\nused for this purpose must:\na. Be chemically stable to concentrated\nsulfuric acid at temperatures of 300 0\nto 400 0 C,\nb. Have low miscibility with sulfuric acid\nat those temperatures,\nc. Have low vapor pressure at those\ntemperatures to prevent loss by\nvaporization ,\nd. Be liquid at room temperature, and\ne. Be relatively inexpensive.\n\nWhile the fluorocarbon fluids meet\nthese criteria, possible problems include:\na. The commercial polymer liquids are\nimpure and tend to evolve hydrogen\nfluoride during the first hour or so of\ncontact with sulfuric acid at the operating temperatures. However, boiling\nthe polymer for several hours at\n3S0\xc2\xb0 C removes the impurities.\nb. The highly fluorinated fluids may\nreact violently with such metals as\naluminum and magnesium and their\nalloys. Thus the pumps, valves, and\nholding tanks of a system must be\nchosen with care.\nThe perfluoroethers, although stable\nto oxygen and ozone, are decomposed\nby halogenated Lewis acids, such as\nAlCI3, SbFS, and CoFS. Therefore any\nuse in cycles other than service with\nsulfuric acid should be evaluated with\nthis behavior in mind.\nThis work was done by Daniel D.\n\nLawson and Gene R.

In particular, it is expected\nto help in developing processes for the\nproduction of high-quality optical glasses in space. Glass containing bubbles\nwould be unacceptable. Since bubbles\narise from gases dissolved in molten\nglass, the ability to predict gas transport\nunder varying conditions will be useful.\nPreviously, most such analyses of\ngas transport have focused on singlebubble systems. Those that have been\ndirected toward multiple-bubble systems have been limited to steady-state\nrather than varying conditions.\nThe new model overcomes the complexities involved in the analysis of varying conditions by making two simplifying assumptions.

Requirements for\nhigher operating temperatures and\ngreater environmental and dimensional\nstability exceed the capabilities of most\nresin\xc2\xb7matrix systems. Metal-matrix composities, one approach to the solution of\nthese problems, suffer from fiber/matrix\nincompatibility and have significantly\ngreater densities than resin-matrix\nsystems. Another approach is the use of\ngraphite-fiber-reinforced glass-matrix\ncomposites (GIG!).\n\n286\n\nGlGI is a structural composite material made of graphite fibers embedded\nin a borosilicate glass. It is made by\npassing graphite-fiber yarn through a\nslurry containing a suspension of fine\nglass particles in a carrier liquid and\nwinding on a drum to produce a prepregged uniaxial tape. After drying, the\ntapes are cut into appropriate lengths\nand laid up in a graphite die in the\ndesired stacking scheme (e.g., uniaxial\nor cross-plied).\nThe stack is consolidated by hot\npressing in a furnace. First, the furnace\n\nis heated to approximately 1,273 K under vacuum to remove all volatiles. The\nfurnace atmosphere is then changed to\nargon, and heating is continued to the\nhot-pressing temperature of approximately 1,723 K. While the temperature is\nheld constant, a pressure of approximately 6.9 MPa is applied to the stack\nfor a minimum of 15 minutes. While\nmaintaining full pressure, the consolidated composite is allowed to cool to\nabout 873 K, where the pressure is removed; and then cooling is continued to\nambient temperature . This consolidation\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnler 1981\n\nprocess can be used to fabricate either\nflat plates or structural shapes such as\nhat sections directly from prepregged\ntapes. Alternatively, structural shapes\ncan be made from previously-consolidated flat plates by a secondary hotforming operation.\nGlGI is relatively lightweight (for a\n6O-percent-fiber volume fraction, specific gravity of about 2.0) with little or no\nporosity. It has a low coefficient of thermal expansion and a fracture toughness\nsimilar to that of graphite-reinforced\nplastics. High strength-to-density and\nstiffness-to-density ratios make it more\nstructurally efficient than any other\nknown material over the temperature\nrange 600 to 800 K. It is thermally stable:\nStrength and fracture toughness are\nmaintained at temperatures up to 800 K.\n\nG/GI is resistant to thermal and\nmechanical fatigue and should have a\nchemical inertness similar to that of\nmonolithic borosilicate glass. It is wearresistant with a low coefficient of friction\nand is machinable by carbide and diamond tools and electric-discharge\nmethod.\nGlGI is expected to find applications\nin structures that require dimensional\nand environmental stability and resistance to thermal cycling and oxidation at\ntemperatures up to at least 700 K. It is\nsuitable for strong lightweight structures\nat use temperatures above those of\ngraphite/epoxy and graphite/polyimide\ncomposites. GlGI is also expected to find\napplication where chemical inertness\nmust be be combined with mechanical\nreliability, such as in chemical ware, pip-\n\ning, process equipment, and cookware.\n\nThis work was done by Karl M.

The new process, which\nis a hybrid of thermal, solution, and\nemulsion polymerization methods, involves the controlled thermal polymerization of the monomer at moderate temperatures without the use of catalysts\nor additives.\nPoly-(n-butyl acrylate) is of interest as\na possible solar-cell encapsulant because of its ultraviolet stability and a\nglass-transition temperature sufficiently\nlow to give it good resistance to temperature extremes. The catalysts and\nadditives used in conventional polymerization processes can limit long-term\nultraviolet and environmental stability.\nFurthermore, each of the conventional\nprocesses suffers from a particular disadvantage: Bulk polymerization gives\npoor control over product molecular\nweight; solution polymerization gives undesirably low molecular weight; and\nemulsion polymerization results in the\nretention of soap and catalyst-fragment\nimpurities in the polymer.\nTo prepare the polymer by the new\nmethod (see figure), one begins by mixing n-butyl acrylate monomer, methanol,\nand water in a stirred reaction vessel\nunder an inert atmosphere. The mixture\nis then heated to a temperature and for\nan amount of time that depend upon the\ndesired degree of conversion . The polymer clings to the walls of the reaction\nvessel, and the solvents are decanted at\nthe end of the reaction period.

The process Is simple and easy to control.\n\nfied by dissolving it in a solvent such as\nmethylene chloride and then evaporating the solvent.\nThe ratios of monomer to water to\nmethanol are not critical. The water dissipates the heat of polymerization, thus\npreventing thermal runaway that promotes undesired cross-linking and degradation and thereby allowing the reaction to proceed to the desired highmolecular-weight conclusion. In pure\nmethanol, a lower-molecular-weight\npolymer is produced. Thus, the monomeriwater/methanol ratios can be adjusted to control the degree of crosslinking and the molecular weight of the\nproduct.\n\nIn a typical experiment, 10 ml of monomer, 40 ml of methanol, and 40 ml of\nwater were stirred into a 250-ml flask.\nThe flask was heated by immersion in a\n90\xc2\xb0 C bath for 24 to 96 hours, maintaining the flask at about 85 0 C internally.\nAfter 90 hours, 90 percent conversion\nwas achieved.

The device\ncontinuously monitors blood pressure\nfor up to 6 months or longer without\nharming the vessel. It is especially useful for vessels smaller than 4 or 5\nmillimeters in diameter.\nUp to now, measurement of pressure\nin small blood vessels has required the\ninsertion of a hypodermic needle. Such\ninvasive methods, however, damage the\nvessel wall, disturb blood flow, and\ncause clotting . Thus they do not always\ngive reliable pressure measurements\nover prolonged periods.\nThe new device is used on an exposed vessel. It is therefore invasive to\nthe body, although not to the arterial\nsystem. The vessel is clamped between\na solid half cylinder and a hollow half cylinder (see figure) held together by retaining rings. A pressure transducer in\nthe solid semicylinder presses against\nthe vessel and detects internal pressure\nthrough the pliable vessel wall. An electrical lead connects to the pressure\ntransducer, which has a flexible pressure-sensing area 3.5 millimeters in\ndiameter.\nThe flat surface of the transducer\ncompresses the vessel over about 20\npercent of its normal circumference.\nTests show that this compression ensures enough contact for a linear relationship between transducer output\nand pressure. The constriction does not\naffect blood flow significantly. In fact,\nthe blood-pressure waveform and level\nare unaffected by reductions in vessel\ncross section up to about 30 percent.\nThe cuff measures pressure in vessels ranging from 1 to 30 millimeters in\ndiameter. It is equally suitable for the\nsmall pressures in veins and the large\npressures in arteries. It furnished accurate data for studies of the carotid,\ncoronary, and renal arteries.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nRETAINING\nRING\n\nHOLLOW\nHALF CYLINDER\n\nBLOOD\nVESSEL ----,r-+.~,r,\n\nPRESSURE\nTRANSDUCER\n\nRETAINING\nRING\n\nCROSS SECTION\n\nA Two\xc2\xb7Plece Cuff Clamps a Blood Vessel for pressure measurements.

One\nresolver is based on potentiometric\nprinciples, the second uses polarization\nfilters, and the third has a variable-capacitance element.\nIn aircraft navigation systems using\ntwo induction magnetometers, the\nmagnetometers are mounted in a\nhorizontal plane with their sensitive\naxes at right angles to one another: One\naxis is parallel to the direction of flight,\nand the other is perpendicular.

The fabrication\nprocess used in forming composite materials allows the chance for microvoid\nformation and similar hard-to-detect imperfections to be present in the final\nproduct.\nFor these materials to reach their full\npotential, it is necessary for an advanced nondestructive-testing technique to characterize quantitatively the\ndefects and physical properties of the\ncomposite-material components. This\ntest technique must assure that defective materials are not put into service\nand that serviceable materials are not\ndiscarded.\nA new portable ultrasonic inspection\ninstrument measures the strength of\ncomposite materials.

Used in quantity, the fixtures\napply precisely similar loads to many\nsamples.\nThe inexpensive fixture is a commercially-available motorcycle-chain repair\ntool to which a steel shim and calibrated\nscrew have been added (see figure). A\nsmall rectangular sample of a com-\n\n298\n\nposite panel is held in the fixture while\nthe screw and shim apply a bending\nstress.\nMany samples must be tested because composites, unlike metals, deteriorate with time under a load or strain;\ntheir behavior under various loads, periods of time, and environmental conditions must be determined. For statistically meaningful data, a large number of\nsamples must be tested for each set of\nconditions.\n\nIn the past, 24 to 100 test samples\nwere tested in commercial strain devices for fixed periods, after which the\nsample strength was measured. Separate duplicate samples were tested after\n1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks. Such tests were\nconducted for various combinations of\ntemperature and humidity under load.\nWith the new fixture, a strain machine is\nused only briefly, to establish the\namount of displacement needed to produce 50 percent or other desired strain\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\non only one sample.\nSamples are cut from large sheets of\ngraphite/epoxy composite by precision\ndiamond saws. Sample dimensions are\ntypically 1,4 by 1 by 0.070 inch (0.635 by\n2.54 by 0.178 cm). Each sample is inserted in a fixture. With a torque wrench,\nthe screw is turned until the shim just\ntouches the sample. A calibration mark\nis made on a 360\xc2\xb0-angle calibration\nsheet atop the fixture. Next, the screw\nis turned through a fixed arc known to\nadvance it against the sample by the\nrequired deflection. (Alternatively, a dial\n\nindicator can be used to measure the\ntravel of the screw.)\nConventional environmental testing\nthen proceeds. The fixtures and their\nsamples are placed in humidity ovens.\nThey are removed after the requisite\nnumber of weeks and subjected to the\nshort-beam shear test in a testing\nmachine.\nThis work was done by Fred W. Tervet\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

Though\nstructural damping is often negligible\ncompared with damping due to air friction and friction in joints, structural\ndamping can be of major importance in\nstructures having heavy damping treatments or in outer-space structures.\nWhen structural damping is the dominant damping mechanism, its nonlinearity must be considered since there is experimental evidence showing that structural damping is basically a nonlinear\nnonviscous phenomenon. Although linear viscous or hysteretic damping models give adequate results in many\nengineering applications, nonlinear nonviscous models are needed to represent\nrealistic structural damping in freevibration or non periodic-vibration\nsituations.\nOne objective of the method is to incorporate many different structural\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\ndamping functions, viscous or nonviscous, in a structure through finiteelement damping matrices. A second\nobjective is to develop and evaluate an\nefficient solution technique for problems\nwith nonviscous damping.\nThe technique first considers incorporating nonviscous damping in a structure through the use of the finite-element\nmethod. Damping is included through\nthe stresS/strain constitutive law by the\naddition of strain-rate-dependent terms.\nThen, the general equations for representing damping matrices are derived\nthrough the principle of virtual work.\nTo solve the set of nonlinear equations resulting when nonviscous damping is present, a solution technique is\ndeveloped by modifying the Newmark\nmethod to accommodate an iterative sclution and to treat the non viscous damping as a pseudoforce. The solution technique was checked for accuracy and\nconvergence in single- and multipledegree-of-freedom problems and was\n\nfound to be accurate and efficient for\ninitial-condition problems with small\nnon viscous damping. Finally, the approach is demonstrated by determining\nthe effects of a specific nonviscous\ndamping model on the transient motion\nof a free-free Timoshenko beam.\nThus, the modeling of structural\ndamping through strain and strain-rate\nterms in the constitutive law of a material is shown to be an effective analytical\ntool because it readily leads to the calculation of damping matrices in the finiteelement method, which yields equations\nof motion that can be solved to investigate the effect of damping. The practicality of this method is yet to be verified\nexperimentally.\nThis work was done by Louis A.\nRoussos of Langley Research Center,\nM. W.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\n\nFigure 1. The Pointer on Gap\xc2\xb7Measurement Tool indicates the width of a gap, in inches,\non a calibrated scale.\n\nA hand-held tool measures small\ngaps between tiles rapidly and accurately, even when the gap is tapered or\nindented below the surface. The tool indicates the gap dimensions on a calibrated disk. Its measurements are accurate within \xc2\xb1 0.003 inch (76 ~m).\nThe tool consists of a flat blade on a\nshaft held by a knurled knob on the calibrated disk (Figure 1). To measure the\nwidth of a gap, the user inserts the blade\ninto the gap and turns the blade into\ncontact with the walls. With the blade\nfirmly in contact with the wails, the user\nturns the pOinter on the disk scale to\nzero. Next, the user rotates the knob in\nthe opposite direction until the blade\nagain contacts the walls . The pointer\nthen indicates the width of the gap.\nTo change the depth at which the gap\nwidth is measured, the user loosens the\nknurled knob so that the blade shaft can\nbe moved up or down, then tightens the\nknob. The user can thus make measurements at progressively smaller or larger\ndepths in the gap (Figure 2).\nThe tool was developed for determining the gap between tiles on the Space\nShuttle. It may be of use in other applications requiring the precise setting of\ngaps between tiles or other structures.\nThis work was done by Donald H.\nHelman and Andrew R. Keir of Rockwell\nInternational Corp. for Johnson Space\nCenter. No further documentation is\navailable.\nMSC-200S7\n\nFigure 2. The Depth of Blade Can Be Adjusted so that tapered or Irregular gaps can be\nmeasured. When the knob is loosened, the blade can be moved from the shallow posi\xc2\xb7\ntion at left to the deep one at right. The blade appears broader at right because it is\nturned more fully toward the viewer, since the gap is wider.\n\n300\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nGage for Surface Waviness\nThree dial indicators with adjustable spacing\ngive a quick check of surface figure.\n\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA new device gives qualitative\nreadings of the flatness, curvature, or\nwaviness of a surface. It was designed\nto check for waviness in the surface of\nthe Space Shuttle prior to the installation\nof heat-resistant tiles, but it could be\nused to measure the regularity or\nirregularity of other surfaces.\nAs the figure shows, the waviness indicator consists of a frame that is supported by two fixed feet and one movable foot plus three dial indicators that\ncan be located with various spacings in\nthe frame. The dial gages are preset to\nread zero on a controlled flat surface.\nThen when the measurement device is\napplied to a surface under test, the dial\nreadings reveal any irregularities. As the\ndevice is moved about on the surface,\nthe dials indicate any departure from\ntrue planar contour.\nThe sliding foot is positioned so that\nits distance from the fixed feet is equal to\nthe width of the area to be measured e.g., the distance between stringers or\nrivet lines. Then the dial indicators are\nspaced equidistantly on the frame . In the\nunit already in use, the indicators can be\nas close as 4 inches (10.16 cm). They\nread positive or negative displacements\nto within 0.001 inch (0.025 mm).\nThis work was done by George W\n.\nWilliams of Rockwell International Corp.\nfor Johnson Space Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nIn a variation of the usual axial-compression test fixture, the specimen\nraises a platen until the specified load\nis applied. Previous fixtures compress\nthe specimen between platens that are\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nmoved toward each other. The new configuration gives better control over the\nload and allows it to be measured more\naccurately. Testing can be stopped\nabruptly if necessary to prevent buckling\n\nor other damage to the specimen.\nAs shown in the figure, the specimen\nis placed between upper and lower\nplatens. The platens are supported by a\nbase and a threaded steel post. The\n(continued on next page)\n301\n\nlower platen rests on a nut and is constrained laterally by a lubricated ridge.\nTie rods attached to an adjacent post\nprevent the lower platen from rotating. A\nlarge wheel extending beyond the lower\nplaten is used to turn the nut, producing\nupward or downward motion of the\nlower platen. A load cell is located in a\npivot hole at the top of the threaded steel\npost.\nThe upper platen is lowered onto the\nload cell, and weights are applied until\nthe true weight recorded by the load cell\nequals the maximum load the operator\nwishes to apply to the specimen. The\nlower platen and the specimen are then\nraised by turning the wheel until the\nspecimen contacts the upper platen.\nLoading of the specimen is seen as a\ndecrease of the load-cell reading .\nWhen the fixture was used to test\na lightweight fiber/epoxy composite\nstructure, the maximum test load was\n2,8001b (1 ,270 kg), and platen displacement was only 0 .010 inch\n(0.25 mm). Six inches (152 mm) of\nwheel rim displacement produced\n0.001 inch (0.025 mm) of platen movement.

The samples determine the effects of multiple exposures to environmental extremes without disturbing the fit or function of the\nparent. They are less costly and more\nconvenient than the complex instrumentation normally required to measure\nthe complete temperature/pressure\ntime history of the parent component.\nFor the reinforced carbon-carbon\n(RCC) panels of the Space Shuttle, such\nsamples are in the form of RCC buttons\nthree-fourths of an inch (1.9 cm) in diameter.

The probe incorporates two hot film sensors, an\nunheated film for temperature compensation and a heated film for pressure\nmeasurement, and a sonic orifice for\nflow con~rol.\nA conventional static-pressure probe\nhas four equally spaced orifices from\n10 to 20 tube diameters downstream of\nits conical tip. In a uniform stream the\nprobe senses the static pressure of the\nstream at the orifices within 1 or 2 percent, but for low static pressures the\nresponse time through the length of\ntubing required to link it to a transducer\ncould be on the order of 35 to 40\nseconds. Therefore, surveying the\nstatic-pressure distribution in a flow\nfield requires an extremely large\nnumber of runs unless the probe\nresponse time is reduced considerably.\nTo reduce response time, a pressure-measuring setup is used that consists of a pair of hot film sensors inside\nthe probe tubing just downstream of the\nexterior orifices. A low mach number is\nmaintained nearly constant over the\nsensors by placing a small flowcontrolling orifice just downstream of\nthem and connecting the probe to a\nvacuum pump. The front sensor is\noperated without overheat ; i ts\nresistance change is proportional to\nthe change in the temperature of the\ngas. The rear sensor is operated in an\noverheat ratio (operating temperature\nto environmental temperature) of 1.5 to\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nHot Film Probe measures static pressure while compensating for gas temperature.\n\n1.8, and its output is directly proportional to the static pressure. The front\nsensor reading is used to compensate\nfor the effect of temperature on the rear\nsensor.\nFor operation, the probe is calibrated\nfor the test gas of interest over the\nrange of environmental temperatures\nand static pressures that are anticipated during the wind-tunnel tests. The\ncalibration is then used to determine\nthe pressure from the probe sensor\nreadings recorded during the windtunnel test. The hot-film-probe settling\ntime for the two-film design is just a few\nmilliseconds, allowing complete flow-\n\nfield surveys to be made in one or two\nruns (with only a slight loss in measurement accuracy) rather than with the\nlarge number of runs previously required.\nThis work was done by Leonard M.\nWeinstein and George C.

Machining away the material surrounding the cone-shaped hole left in the\nspecimen makes it ready for other uses.\nThe method was developed for measuring the tensile strength of the Space\nShuttle thermal-protection tiles.

One of the most\nsuccessful of these materials is the\nboronlaluminum (B/AI) composite in\nwhich standard aluminum alloys are reinforced with continuous high-strength\nboron fibers. The improved structural\nproperties of the B/Al composite stem\nprimarily from the fiber. The resultant\nproduct is not only much stronger and\nstiffer than the best high-strength aluminum alloys but it also can be used effectively at significantly higher temperatures.\nIn designing for the mechanical behavior of BfAl composites containing\nhigh volume-fractions of fiber, the simplifying assumption is generally made that\nthe fibers and thus the composite\nbehave as brittle elastic materials. Although this assumption is approximately\nvalid at low temperatures (near room\ntemperature and below), it can produce\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nserious design errors for elevated-temperature applications. This is due to the\nfact that boron fibers are not truly elastic\nmaterials but deform and fracture in a\nmanner that is both time and temperature dependent. Thus for tensile stresses applied along the fiber direction and\nat elevated temperatures, there exists a\nneed to design for the fiber-controlled\ncreep and stress-rupture behavior of\nB/Al composites.\nTo develop a predictive theory to account for these timeltemperature effects, a series of deformation and fracture studies was performed on commercial boron fibers over wide ranges of\nstress, stress application time, and temperature. Within these ranges, it was\ndetermined that the deformation strain,\nfracture strain, and fracture stress of the\nboron fiber could be described by very\nsimple timeltemperature-dependent\nequations. By combining these singlefiber results with fracture theory for\nmetal matrix composites, design formulas were also derived that describe\n\nB/Al composite tensile and stress rupture strengths as a function of time and\ntemperature. Calculated short-time tensile strengths for BIAI composites were\nfound to agree to within 3 percent with\nexperimental strength data between 70\xc2\xb7\nand 750\xc2\xb7 F (20\xc2\xb7 and 400\xc2\xb7 C). Because\nthe design equations are based on\nboron fiber deformation, they can also\nbe used for understanding and predicting the time/temperature-dependent\nmechanical behavior of other composite\nsystems reinforced by boron fibers.\nThis work was done by James A.\nDicarlo of Lewis Research Center.\nFurther information may be found in\nNASA TM-81474 [N80-21452INSP] ,\n"Predicting the Time-Temperature Dependent Axial Failure of BIAI Composites" [$6.50].

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA new method for testing the peel\nstrength of a particular thermal\xc2\xb7control\ntape used on the Space Shuttle orbiter\nradiators requires only half the amount\nof tape of the method previously employed. Since each of the 60 rolls of tape\napplied to the Space Shuttle radiators\nmust be peel-tested, the cost saving with\nthe new method is substantial.\nThe new method consumes only\n4 feet (1.2 m) of each 1OO-ft (30 .5-m) roll ,\nwhereas the old method consumed 8\nfeet (2.4 m). The method also avoids the\ncost of labor and materials to prepare a\nsecond test coupon and can be adapted\nfor testing other types of double-facedadhesive tapes in military, industrial, and\nconsumer applications.\nThe thermal-control tape consists of\nlayers of FEP, silver, Inconel metal, adhesive, Kapton film, and a second adhesive layer (see Figure 1). Because two\nadhesive bonds are involved - one\nagainst the aluminum sheet and one\nagainst the Inconel metal layer, both\nbonds must be tested. Previously, each\npeel test was conducted on a separate\n4-ft cutting of tape. Now, however, a\nsingle 4-ft cutting is used.\nThe tape cutting is applied to a 12by 12-inch (30.5- by 30.5\xc2\xb7cm) aluminum\ncoupon in three strips, each extending 4\ninches (10.2 cm) beyond the edge of the\ncoupon (Figure 2). Each strip is slit longitudinally into 1-inch (2.54-cm) ribbons. A\nribbon is peeled back away from the aluminum, while the peeling force is measured, to about half the specimen length,\nas directed in ASTM standard D-903. At\nthat point, the Kapton film separating the\ntwo adhesive layers is carefully cut\nthrough .

Cleaning can then be done on the\nareas that most need it.\nThe photoelectron emission technique is based on the fact that aluminum\nand epoxy surfaces emit electrons when\nthey are exposed to ultraviolet light,\nwhile such emissions are attenuated by\ncontaminating films. Thus, the photoelectron current from a contaminated\nsurface will be less than that from an\nuncontaminated one.\nA contamination-measurement probe\nbased on the photoelectron principle\nconsists of an ultraviolet lamp to which a\ncurrent-collector electrode is attached\n(Figure 1). As the lamp scans the surface, the collected photoelectron current is measured and recorded. Cur(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalilWlnter 1981\n\nFigure 2.

The peaks\n(high photoelectron emission) represent\nlow contamination, and the valleys (low\nphotoelectron emission) represent high\ncontamination .\nIn tests, adhesion properties of surfaces treated with controlled quantities\nof known contaminants (Figure 2, right)\ncorrelated closely with photoemission\nmeasurements for the surfaces. The\ncontamination was removed to various\ndegrees by wiping the surfaces with dry\ntissue or tissue saturated with cleaning\nsolvent.\n\nThe following adhesion tests were\nthen performed:\n\xc2\xb7Pressure-sensitive tapes were applied\nto the surfaces, and the forces required to peel back the tapes were\nmeasured.\n-Contaminated surfaces were bonded\nto uncontaminated ones with foam and\nwere measured for lap-shear strength.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Foam-bonded contaminated and uncontaminated surfaces were placed in\na humidity chamber at 60 0 C and 100\npercent relative humidity for 16 hours,\nwhile the propagation of a pilot crack\nwas observed.\nInterestingly, the photoelectron current emitted by an epoxy surface is not\nconstant, but drops off with increasing\ntime of exposure to ultraviolet light. After\nabout 2 minutes of exposure, the supply\nof electrons apparently starts to become\ndepleted. After the UV light is removed,\n\nthe photoelectron emission does not\nrecover.\nFortunately, the photoelectron depletion effect does not hamper the new\nprobe since it moves continuously over\nthe surface, scanning a swath 9 inches\n(23 cm) wide.

The angle transducer is a rotary\npotentiometer, the wiper shaft of which\nis clamped to a pivoted double-parallelogram reference arm. The moving end of\nthe linkage, to which the potentiometer\nshaft is attached, remains parallel to\nthe fixed end of the linkage because the\nopposite sides of the parallelograms\nremain parallel. Thus the potentiometer\nshaft remains at a constant reference angle in space when the parallelogram linkage is moved to flex the joint.\nFlexing the free end of the pressuresuit jOint by moving the free end of the\nparallelogram linkage rotates the body\nof the angle-transducer potentiometer\nwith respect to the shaft.

The new system allows for the first time an in-depth\nstudy of the effects of tail-fin spin\nrates on pitch-, yaw-, and roll-control\ncharacteristics.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the tail\nrotates on bearings and is coupled\nto an electromagnet by a sliding ring,\nwhich makes up part of the magnetic\npath. The magnet is mounted on a straingage torque balance, which measures\nthe torque between the tail and the\nmodel.\nThe ring coupling is attracted to the\nelectromagnet with a force proportional\nto the current in the coil.

This system allows the\npilot to bailout from the left side of the\nairplane by creating an opening where\nno door exists. ThFi egress system is\nsimple and highly responsive, requiring\nminimal modifications to the airplane.\nThe new emergency system uses a\nsmall quantity of explosive [less than 0.4\nounce (11.3 gm)] to sever and jettison a\npanel from the airplane. The system is\ninitiated mechanically when the pilot\npulls a pivoting handle.

The theory is potentially applicable to such practical problems as\naircraft panel flutter, nondestructive\ntesting, piezoelectric transducer deSign,\nthe distortion of optical surfaces, and\ntolerance stud ies of very precise\nmachine parts.\nThe phYSical model for the study is the\nfree surface of an elastic body streamlined by the flow of an inviscid fluid. The\nequations of motion are formulated from\nthe principle of virtual work, for small\nsurface displacements and corresponding fluid velocities. Motion of the whole\nbody is not considered: Rather, the\npotential-energy term in the equation of\n\nmotion includes only elastic strain\nenergy due to displacements at and\nnear the surface, and the kinetic-energy\nterm likewise Includes only velocities in\nthe surface region.\nAn equation is obtained for the motion\nof the surface in a direction perpendicular to itself. The equation is further specialized by setting the potential energy\nfor shearing deformations in the fluid\nequal to zero for the inviscid case and by\nincorporating the stresS/strain relations\nfor an isotropic elastic body.\nThe resulting wave equation serves\nas a boundary condition relating the\nthree-dimensional equations of fluid and\nelasticity for the two mediums. The\nequation is also of interest in itself since\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalilWinter 1981\n\n313\n\nit can be used to derive qualitatively\nsome basic dynamic properties of the\nfree surfaces of elastic bodies. Consideration of the propagation of high-frequency oscillations with small displacements transverse to the surface leads\nquite naturally to results that depict instabilities - that is, waves that grow\nfrom infinitesimal to finite amplitudes.\nMicroroughness or wrinkling is an instance of this.\n\nThe onset of wrinkling can be described by a quantitative criterion, which\nshows that the stability of the smooth\nsurface shape decreases with an increase in tangential compressive stress\nandlor in fluid velocity. Surface contraction appears to have a low-compression\nregime in which smoothness is not affected and a high-compression regime\nin which free-surface filaments can be\nconsidered to buckle when the longitudinal stress exceeds a limiting value.\n\nThe theory has been applied to a cylindricallinear elastic shaft rotating in an\ninviscid fluid. Even when the shaft transmits no torque to a load, the equations\nshow that wrinkles will be induced by the\nmere rotation of the shaft when the angular velocity exceeds the critical value.\nThis work was done by Michail Zak of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

Next, the\nstructure is redesigned with respect to\nstress constraints based on the results\nof the prebuckling analysis. Then a\nbuckling analysis of the current design,\nunder the action of the internal forces\nobtained in the prebuckling analysis, is\nperformed. The structure then is redesigned with respect to buckling with\nthe element sizes determined in step\ntwo being used as minimum size constraints . The classical stress-ratio\nmethod is employed with respect to\nstress constraints. This procedure will\ndrive the final design to the fully stressed\ndesign, which does not necessarily coincide with the minimum weight distribution of the material. For the constraints\non the general buckling loads, the\nredesign procedure is derived directly\nfrom an optimality criterion . Consequently, the element sizes converge\ntoward the minimum weight design.\nInputs to DESAP 2 consist of an initial\nfinite-element model of the structure\nand a set of constraint conditions. Basic\nstructural elements available in DESAP\n2 include three-dimensional bars, threedimensional beams, quadrilateral and\ntriangular-plane stress elements, quadrilateral shear panels, quadrilateral and\ntriangular plate elements, and a special\nboundary element.

Its objective is to find the element sizes (crosssectional areas, plate thicknesses, and\nthe like) that minimize the total structural\nweight without changing the layout of\nthe structure.\nThe primary constraints used in the\nDESAP 2 synthesis algorithm are upper\nlimits on stresses and lower bounds on\nbuckling loads.

Each program is associated with a distinct physical problem\nclass and has its own finite-element library. The fifth program, SATELLITE, is a\nmath-model preprocessor for data debugging, plotting of input geometries,\nand node resequencing.\nBEND computes the static-elastic,\nelastic-plastic, and elastic-cyclic-plastic\nresponse of arbitrary built-up thin-walled\nstructures where bending and membrane effects are equally important. The\nBEND element library includes a threenode uniform strain triangle, a six-node\nlinearly-varying strain triangle, both a\nfour- and a five-node hybrid triangle for\nuse as a transition element, a two-node\nuniform strain stringer, a three-node\nlinearly-varying strain stringer, a variety\nof cross sections for beams that may be\nsubjected to bending about two planes\nas well as torsion, and a higher-order\ntriangular plate element with bending\nand membrane capabilities.\nHEX performs the static-elastic, elastic-plastic, and elastic-cyclic-plastic response of arbitrary three-dimensional\nsolid structures. for modeling, HEX offers a family of isoparametric hexahedron elements consisting of a basic\n8-node hexahedron and higher order\nhexahedrons with up to 12 additional\nmidside nodes.\nREVBY was developed for the staticelastic, elastic-plastic, and elastic-cyclic-plastic analysis of orthotropic\naxisymmetric solids of revolution subjected to axisymmetric loadings. Three\ndifferent elements are available in\nREVBY for the analysis of both thick and\nthin bodies of revolution. These consist\nof a revolved triangular element, a thin\nshell element, and a thin-ring stiffener\nelement.\nOUT-Of-PLANE MG is used for the\nstatic nonlinear analysis of built-up thinwalled structures, including the effects\nof combined material and geometric\nnonlinearities; however, bending and\nmembrane effects are not considered\nsignificant. The OUT-Of-PLANE MG element library includes a three-node uniform stress triangle, a six-node linearlyvarying stress triangle, both a four- and a\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nfive-node hybrid triangle for use as a\ntransition element, a two-node uniform\nstress stringer, a three-node linearlyvarying stress stringer, and a variety of\ncross sections for beams that may be\nsubjected to bending about two planes\nas well as torsion .\nSATELLITE is a data preprocessor for\nthe BEND, REVBY, and OUT-Of-PLANE\nMG programs. The SATELLITE program\nchecks and plots the undeformed math\nmodel to aid the user in detecting modeling errors. An option is also included\nfor reordering the node numbers\nsuch that the minimum semibandwidth\nis achieved, thus improving the efficiency of the analysis programs.\nAll four of the analysis programs employ the " initial strain" concept within an\nincremental procedure to account for\nthe effect of plasticity and to include the\ncapability for cyclic-plastic analYSis. The\nsolution procedure for treating material\nnonlinearities alone reduces to the incremental analysis of an elastic body of\nidentical shape and boundary conditions\nbut with an additional set of applied\n"pseudoloads." This solution technique\ndoes not require modification of the element stiffness matrix at each incremental load step. Combined material and\ngeometric nonlinearities are treated in\nthe OUT-Of-PLANE MG program by using the "updated" or convected coordinate approach.\nThe PLANS programs are written in\nfORTRAN IV for batch execution and\nhave been implemented on both a CDC\nCYBER 175 computer and an IBM\n370-series computer. Most of the\nPLANS programs for the CDC are segmented with the largest having a central\nmemory requirement of approximately\n256K (octal) of 60-bit words.

Since such\nconditions are characterized by large\nregions of separated flow and are\ndominated by strong viscous interaction\neffects, inviscid methods are not applicable.\nTRANSEP calculates the flow field\nabout a low-speed single-element airfoil\nat high-angle-of-attack and high-lift conditions with massive boundary-layer separation. Since TRANSEP includes the effects of weak viscous interactions, it can\nalso be used for subsonic/transonic airfoil design and analysis. The approach\nused in TRANSEP is based on the directinverse method and its ability to use\neither the displacement surface or pressure as the airfoil boundary condition .\nIn the present TRANSEP code, the\nturbulent boundary layer is computed\nusing the Nash-Macdonald method. for\nthe laminar portion , the boundary layer\nis computed using a compressible\nThwaites method. These integral methods are efficient and reliable and yield\nexcellent predictions for displacementthickness values. Internally, the transition point is determined from a Granvilletype correlation based upon the difference between the local momentumthickness Reynolds number and the\nvalue at the laminar instability point\ncombined with the pressure gradient\nhistory.\nThe calculation procedure used in\nTRANSEP is an iterative successivecolumn-relaxation scheme with the\nseparation point and separated pres\xc2\xb7\nsure level being permitted to vary.

One electrode is a reference\nelectrode, covering all of the outside of\nthe vial except the surface over the path\nof the bubble. The other two electrodes,\nlocated symmetrically on either side of\nthe center position for the bubble, are as\nlong and wide as the bubble.\nAn electrical indication of the bubble\nposition is obtained by a differential\nmeaurement of the capacitances between each sensing electrode and the\nreference electrode. The liquid in the vial\nhas a dielectric constant of about 80,\nwhile the bubble volume has a dielectric\nconstant of 1; the difference in dielectric\nconstant in between the sensing electrodes and the reference produces the\nchanges in differential capacitance.\nThe measuring circuit for the tiltmeter\n(see Figure 2) uses a 300-kHz oscillator\nto excite a diode bridge, which produces\na voltage output that depends on the difference in capaCitances appearing at\neither side of the bridge.

A point-to-point grid\npattern is established to achieve precision spray coverage; the spacer rod or\ntube makes sure that the robot holds the\nspray gun perpendicular to the surface\nbeing coated and at the correct distance\nfrom it. This technique was originally\ndeveloped for applying an ablative composition to a solid rocket booster.\nThe figure shows the teaching aid,\nwith its three-point contact and line level,\nattached to a spray-gun head held by the\nflexible arm of the manipulator. Point-topoint programing is a system in which\nthe moving pattern of the robot manipulator is "taught" by recording of a\nnumber of separate points. The exact\ntime of recording for each point is determined manually - unlike a continuous\nrecording in which a fixed number of\npoints is recorded per unit time. When\nthe recording switch on the handle is depressed, the position of the manipulator\nat that moment is recorded on a disk for\nstorage.

These are\ntransformed by projection onto the joint\nspace of the manipulator. The final control signal for each axis is a weighted\nsum of the force and position control\nparameters provided onto it. Thus there\n\n320\n\nis a continuous control of each actuator\nresponsive to both position and force\nsimultaneously, and there is no need to\nswitch explicitly from one to the other.\nAs the manipulator operates within a\ngiven control regime, there is a gradual\nchangeover shaped by the projection of\nthe changing manipulator geometry.\nRegimes, which involve the specification of orthogonal position and force\ncontrol directions in task coordinates,\n\nare naturally task dependent and are\nspecified at the time tasks are set up.\nIn robot manipulators that are used\nfor manufacturing processes, warehouse storage and retrieval, and the like,\nboth the force and the position trajectory\n(or velocity or acceleration) of each\nmovement must be specified for each\ntask degree of freedom . For example,\nthe simple task of inserting a pin in a\nsocket (see figure) requires position con-\n\nNASA Tech BrIefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\ntrol along the z-axis and force limiting\nalong the other two axes to prevent\nscraping against sides of the socket and\npin.\nThe control of these dual modes of\noperation has involved complex concepts and methods in the past. One approach was to multiplex the sensing and\ncontrol for each actuator and to choose\nwhich mode to employ in each time interval. Thus one actuator might be carrying out a position correction while ignoring the force error caused thereby, while\nanother was responding solely to force\nerror. The result was an output that\ndithered.\nThis new hybrid control technique\ndoes not require the operator to supply\ncomplex transform matrices.

The speeds of the flywheels\nwould be automatically regulated to null\nthe dynamic forces transmitted to the\nbearings.\nAlthough originally developed for\nspace platforms, the concept should\nalso be useful for compensating rotating\nbodies on Earth. For example, it may be\napplied to a large industrial centrifuge,\nparticularly if its balance changes during\noperation.\n\nImbalance forces arise to some extent in any body rotating about a fixed\naxis and connected to a fixed platform.\nThis is because manufacturing imperfections make it impossible to produce a\ntruly symmetrical body and to locate the\nspin axis precisely at an axis of a principal moment of inertia. Moreover, the\naxis of rotation may be quite different\nfrom the axis of symmetry. For example,\na parabolic antenna reflector is symmetric about the boresight axis, which is\nnot generally coincident with the spin\naxis. Although weights .can be attached\n\nto a body to improve its balance, such\ncompensation is always approximate.\nIn the new gyroscopic compensation\nmethod, the spinning body, or rotor, is\nsupported on a stable platform by a\nbearing assembly and driven by a motor.\nTwo additional motors are fixed on the\nrotor so that their axes of symmetry are\nperpendicular to one another and also\nperpendicular to the rotor spin axis (see\nfigure). Flywheels are mounted on the\nshafts of the auxiliary motors.\nThe objective in the technique is to\nspin the motorlflywheel combinations so\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\n323\n\nthat their gyroscopic torques compensate for the imbalance forces of the spinning rotor. The compensation relieves\nforces on the bearings and removes the\ndisturbance to the stable platform.\nIn operation, the rotor is accelerated\nto its operating speed. The jitter produced in the platform by rotor imbalance\nis sensed by accelerometers or strain\ngages. The speed and direction of the\ntwo flywheels are adjusted - either automatically or by an operator - until the\nplatform jitter is reduced. The flywheels\nare then rotated at fixed speeds to maintain the imbalance compensation. If the\nrotor balance changes, the flywheel\nspeeds are also changed.\nFor automatic imbalance control,\nstrain gages can produce signals with\namplitudes that are instantaneously proportional to force components exerted\nby the rotor. These signals can be\nsampled, applied to dc amplifiers, and\nused to control the flywheel motor\nspeeds.\nThis work was done by John A.\nHrastar, Sr., of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.

Its speed and\nblade pressure ensure a high waferproduction rate . Lightweight , balanced construction minimizes blade\nvibration and reduces the sideways\nmotion that would otherwise widen the\nkerf and waste silicon.\nA typical commercial reciprocating\ncutter for silicon ingots 3 in. (7.6 cm) in\ndiameter moves a 220-lb (100-kg) bladehead over an 8-in . (20.3-cm) stroke at a\nrate of 100 ftlmin (30 m/min) or less. In\n\n324\n\ncontrast, the new bladehead (see figure)\nweighs only 37 Ib (17 kg), has a stroke of\n16 in. (41 cm), and travels at more than\n400 ftlmin (120 m/min). The higher\nspeed results in longer blade life and\nbetter cutting action.\nThe new machine employs wire\nblades for lightness, as well as a\nlightweight structure for supporting\nand tensioning the blades. As a result,\nrelatively little mass is accelerated\nwith each sawing motion , and the\nblade comes up to speed faster .\nMoreover, because the stroke is\n\nlonger than on a conventional machine , the blades cut through the\nsilicon much faster for a given rate of\nsawing motion . Two ingots are sliced\nsimultaneously ; the two bladeheads\n(only one is seen in the figure) are\nsynchronized so that both accelerate\nin opposite directions at the same\nrate .

As a result,\nproduction rates are high , cuts are accurate, and little material Is wasted. The wires\nare 30 in. (76.2 cm) long and 5.7 mils (0.14 mm) in diameter.

It uses no brushes that might abrade solar surfaces and\nthereby reduce their efficiency - a\nparticularly important advantage when\nreflectors are made of a relatively soft\nmaterial such as aluminized plastic\nfilm . The machine can be readily\nautomated and can be used on curved\nsurfaces such as parabOlic reflectors\nas well as on flat ones. The cleaning\nfluids are recycled, so that large quantities of water and solvent are not needed.\nThe concept is not limited to solar\npanels, but can be applied to other surfaces as well- for example, operatingroom walls and the windows of highrise buildings. It can be adapted to\nblowing heated air over surfaces for defrosting or drying and to applying\ncoatings.

Several such heads are arranged in a row and scan the solarpanel surface. A cleaning liquid (usually\na detergent, water, or a solvent) is applied to the panel surface from the nozzle shown at the right. A small gap between the head and the panel surface\nallows air to be drawn into the nozzle\nfrom outside and to aid in vortex formation. A gap of 0.020 to 0.040 inch (0.5 to\n1 mm) is effective.\nInside the left chamber, a jet of air\nswirls over the film of cleaning liquid\nwhile a vacuum tube exhausts air. The\nvortex thus created agitates the film,\ndislodging and dissolving dirt particles,\nand draws off the liquid and the particles. The vortex removes oil and\nfilmlike contaminants as readily as it\ndoes dirt particles.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nBushings that are fitted to close tolerances and that have limited access can\nbe removed without damage to their\nhousing by using a bolt with an integrated locking dog. Such self-retaining\npositive-locking bolts (HI-SAFE\xc2\xae , or\nequivalent) are normally used as fasteners in critical joints where an accidentally loosened bolt could cause damage\nor injuries. However, workers on the\nSpace Shuttle orbiter found that these\n\n326\n\nsame bolts could be used to remove\nbushings on the orbiter structure without damaging the delicate thermalprotection tiles. Such bolts could also\nbe used to remove bushings from such\nmach inery as automotive engine\nblocks, transmissions, and gearboxes\nor from water pumps with " blind " rotorsupport bushings.\nBefore installing the bushing, a hole\nis drilled in one side of it to accommo-\n\ndate the short dog on the bolt. The bolt\nfor removing the bushing (see figure)\nhas a button that releases or retracts\nthe short dog. To remove the bushing,\nthe proper-diameter bolt with the dog\nretracted is inserted into the bushing ,\nand the dog is released by removing\npressure from the button. The bolt is\nthen rotated until the dog engages the\nhole in the bushing. When the bolt is\npulled out, the bushing comes with it.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nDepressing the button disengages the\nlocking dog from the bushing.\nOther methods for removing limitedaccess bushings utilize tools that pass\nthrougn the bushing bore and then extend fingers to engage the far end of the\nbushing. During extraction, these fingers, which are in tension, are prone to\nbreak. However, since the dog on the\nbolt is in shear, it is less likely to break.\n[H I-SAFE\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of\nthe Hi-Shear Corp.]\nThis work was done by Charles E.\nHaverkamp of McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. for Johnson Space Center.

Roller Staking Tool (center and right) was used to insert the snap-tool ball, 0.187 inch (4.75 mm) in diameter, in the snap-tool\nbody (left). The three equidistant balls in the ball cage apply rolling pressure to the body. The tip of the central rod contains a recess in a\nball pilot that centers and seats the snap-tool ball. The brass cage can be removed easily so that worn cage balls can be replaced.\n\nA simple tool stakes hard-steel\nparts - that is, forces one part into a recess on another, deforming the receiving part so that it restrains the inserted\none. The tool allows small machine\nshops to stake hard steel without massive presses. It can be used, for example, to insert a ball and spring into a hardsteel snap-tool body such as that\nused to turn socket wrenches (Figure 1).\nIts use is not limited to hard steel ; it can\nbe used as well to assemble parts made\nof softer materials.\nThe tool consists of a mandrel , a cage\ncontaining three balls [each 0.094 inch\n(2 .3 mm) in diameter], and a sliding cen\xc2\xb7\ntral rod (Figure 2). For the staking of a\nball in a snap-tool body, the mandrel is\nmounted in a drill press so that it can ap\xc2\xb7\nply pressure while rotating . The mandrel\ncentral rod seats the ball .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA simple design change for a poppet\nrelief valve enables the flow through the\nvalve to exert additional force to help\nkeep the valve open. Although originally\nintended for relief valves for liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen in the Space\nShuttle orbiter, the concept is applicable\nto pressure- or flow-actuated valves for\na wide range of fluids and temperatures.\nAs shown in the figure, the modification consists in adding a shroud ring\naround the edge of the poppet. Once the\nupstream-to-downstream pressure differential suffices to open the poppet\nagainst the spring and frictional forces,\nthe flow exerts an additional opening\nforce. The flow must reverse itself somewhat in order to clear the shroud ring,\nand so the additional force is a function\nof the rate-of-change of fluid momentum. The maximum flow-pressure differential is reduced, since the additional\nforce causes the valve to open more fully than it otherwise would.\nThe improved design enabled a relief\nvalve for the Space Shuttle to meet all\nspecified performance requirements in\nthe smallest, lightest configuration.\nPotential users include processing\nplants or other fluid-handling facilities.\n\nThis work was done by Julian Luger of\nParker Hannifin Corp. for Johnson\nSpace Center.

The\nprogram is motivated by the need for\nmechanisms that will operate for long\nperiods in spacecraft or space stations.\nTests reported thus far have included\n38 lubricants selected to represent most\nof the military grease specifications as\nwell as promising nonspecification materials. Twenty motors, each containing\ntwo test bearings lubricated with the\n330\n\ncandidate grease, are set up in each test\nchamber. The motors are mounted on\nan aluminum plate furnished with passages \xc2\xb7 for water and liquid nitrogen, so\nthat temperature can be controlled.\nSince the motors are small ac hysteresis\ntypes, there is no problem of overheating or further bearing damage when a\nmotor stalls due to bearing failure, nor is\nthere any brush dust to contaminate the\nbearings.\nTo insure a statistical sample, each\ntest set consists of four motors (eight\nbearings). A set of 20 motors thus allows\nfive different greases to be tested simultaneously. Samples are tested until failure, or else for 1 year. Lubricants that do\nwell in the 1-year tests are selected for\nfurther evaluation in 5-year tests.\nTest environments include:\n-10 psi (6.9 x 104 N/m 2) oxygen at 90\npercent relative humidity;\n-Vacuum , ambient temperature\n(38 0 C);\n-Vacuum, high temperature (93.3 0 C);\n-Vacuum, ambient temperature, with\nstart/stop operation ; and\n-Low-temperature start (various\ntemperatures).\n\nThe evaluations for all tests (except\nlow-temperature start) are based on a\ngo/no-go system: A bearing failure is\ndeemed to occur when the bearing\ntends to seize, causing the motor to\nstop. Data recorded in each case include total test time, vacuum or atmosphere conditions, temperature, and\ntotal number of on/off cycles where appropriate. Bearings are weighed before\nand after testing, so that the fractional\nlubricant weight loss can be calculated. Selected bearings may be disassembled and further examined.\nThe class of lubricants based on perfluoroalkylpolyether (PFPE) with fluorotelomer thickeners has given the best\nresults in the vacuum tests completed\nthus far. Other promising materials include some silicone, synthetic-ester,\nand mineral greases. The test methods\nand performances of the various lubricants could be of interest in the automotive and industrial communities.\nThis work was .done by E.

It has long been recognized that\nthin sheets of metal have greater fracture toughness than thicker sheets. In a\nnew technique developed at Langley Research Center, several thin sheets are\ndiffusion-brazed together in a vacuum\nfurnace to create a thick piece of metal\nthat retains much of the fracture\ntoughness of its thin components. In\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWinter 1981\n\npreliminary testing , Charpy impact\nvalues, indicators of fracture toughness,\nhave been increased by a factor of as\nmuch as 5.\nThis technique is expected to make\nmany of the high-strength stainless\nsteets, not currently suitable, usable at\ncryogenic temperatures.

Feedback Control CIrcuIt focuses the electron beam In response to the weld temperature sensed by photodlode, 01.\n\nAn electron-beam welder is automatically focused by the feedback circuit\nshown schematically in Figure 1. A\nsquare-wave generator modulates the\ncurrent in the electron-beam focus coil\nso that the focal point is varied between\npoints slightly above and below the surface of the weld. A sensor detects the intensity of light emitted by the weld,\nwhich is proportional to the fourth power\nof the temperature at the hottest part of\nthe weld spot. The sensor signal is\ndetected by a chopper demodulator synchronized by the square-wave generator, to determine whether the average\nposition of the focal point is higher than,\n\n342\n\ncoincident with, or lower than the optimum point; and the focus coil current is\nadjusted accordingly.\nWhen the focal point is at the surface\nof the workpiece, the temperature at the\ncenter of the hotspot will be maximum.\nAs the focal point is moved above or\nbelow the surface, the electron-beam\nenergy is distributed over a larger area,\nand peak temperature will decrease.\nHowever, if the focal point is controlled\nso that its average position is at the surface, the power density is approximately\nconstant because the slight degree of\ndefocusing is equal on both sides of the\nsurface. Since power density is then\n\nconstant, both temperature and light\noutput are also constant. If the beam\nbecomes significantly defocused, however, the light sampled by the sensor will\nno longer be constant, and the sensor\nwill then produce a difference signal.\nThe difference signal will be detected by\na differential amplifier, and a servo circuit will alter the modulating current in\nthe focus coil.\nThe optics transmit visible light from\nthe weld spot to the sensor while excluding almost all the radiant heat (see\nFigure 2). An inexpensive glass window\nadmits light to the optics but seals out\nmetal vapors; when the glass becomes\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\ncoated with metal, it can be replaced\neasily. A heat-reflective mirror stops\nmos~ of the radiant heat and passes visible light. Much of the remaining heat is\neliminated by heat-conductive mirrors,\nwhich reflect visible light but allow radiant heat to pass through and be\nlost. A simple lens focuses the visiblelight image of the weld spot on the photosensor.\nThe same principle used to focus the\nbeam can be used to make the beam folIowa seam or crack between the parts\nto be joined. The position of the beam\ncan be alternated between opposite\nsides of the seam. The temperature in\nthe weld area will be higher on the side\nof the seam that receives the most\npower.

Sometimes, however, nickel plating may not\nbe feasible because of the manufacturing sequence, the size of the hardware, or the lack of a suitable source for\nnickel plating. All alternative surface\npreparation in such cases is to grit-blast\nthe surface lightly and then plasmaspray 1 V2 to 2 mils (0.04 to 0.05 mm) of\nfine nickel powder or braze-alloy material directly on the surface. The powder is\nsprayed from a plasma gun, using argon\nas the carrier gas to prevent oxidation of\nthe nickel or braze alloy.\nThe plasma-spraying technique as a\nbrazing aid to replace nickel plating of\nbraze surfaces can be used for brazing\nalloys that contain aluminum and tita-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\nnium, such as A-286, Inconel-718, MARM-246, Rene-41, 713, and others. Unlike\nwet-spray methods, which allow little\ncontrol and do not work with difficult-tobraze alloys, the plasma-sprayed\ndeposit can withstand handling under\nmanufacturing conditions. Moreover,\nthe sprayed braze alloy does not contaminate furnace atmospheres.\nAll example of successful use of this\ntechnique was the brazing of 1,080 tubeto-hole joints in the aft manifold of a\nSpace Shuttle main-engine flight nozzle.\nIn this case the manifold had been welded to the flight jacket and the braze alloy\nhad been attached to the jacket, prior to\nthe discovery that the nickel plating was\npeeling off in the manifold holes. The\nschedule, cost considerations, and lack\n\nof nickel-plating facilities all made it\nmandatory to devise another method for\npreparing the braze surfaces of the\n1,080 holes.\nThe method used was to plasmaspray Nickel-200 into the entrances and\nexits of the manifold holes. One constraint on this technique is that\nalloys containing manganese can be\nused only if the manganese content is\nless than 10 percent and special precautions are taken to minimize oxidation\nof the braze-alloy powder.\nThis work was done by Alexander\nBrennan of Rockwell International Corp.\nfor Marshall Space Flight Center.

Yield\nstress and ultimate tensile strength tend\nto decrease with weld size (see figure).\nThis conclusion supports the view of\nmany professional welders who give priority to weld geometry over welding\nenergy or COOling rate as an indicator of\nweld quality. In fact, it is common practice among welders to adjust weld heat\n(that is, current) from workpiece to work\xc2\xb7\npiece and even along the same bead to\nmaintain constant weld dimensions.\nThe study was conducted on specimens welded at 15 different combina\xc2\xb7\ntions of weld power and heat-removal\nrate. The specimens were made from\nplates 1,4 inch (6.35 mm) thick, joined\nwith multipass, square-butt, gas/tungsten arc welds.\nThe elongation at break, yield stress,\nand ultimate tensile strength were\nmeasured for each specimen. Although\nthese properties were clearly functions\nof both the power input and the cooling\nrate, the precise relationship could not\nbe discerned. Cooling rate was difficult\nto determine or even hold constant. Consequently, power input to a weld can be\nregarded as only a rough determinant of\nmechanical properties, at best.\nThe test results agreed generally with\npredictions based on the soft-interlayer\ntheory of weld strength. According to\nthis theory, weld jOints in metals like\naluminum may be treated as a soft layer\nof material between two hard, flat plate\nends. If the weld is wider than the thickness of the parent metal plate, the joint\nyields at about the yield stress of the\nrelatively-soft weld metal.

The size of the meniscus was minimized previously by removing as much of the accumulated\npaint as possible with a hypodermic\nsyringe, but the properties of the\nmeniscus could not be reproduced or\npredicted with less than 0.05 percent\nuncertainty.\nTo prevent the formation of the meniscus, a small tube is formed at the\napex of the cone. One end of the tube,\nwhich is bent through a 90\xc2\xb0 arc, is accessible through a small hole in the\nthermal conductance.\nDuring the painting process, excess\npaint is drawn out through the tube,\npreventing the formation of a meniscus\nat the apex.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA metal-plated butyl rubber seal has\nbeen devised for the enclosures of electronic equipment that must be maintained under a dry, inert atmosphere.\nThe seal prevents gas leakage over prolonged periods, while its conductivity\nsuppresses electromagnetic emissions\nfrom the sealed equipment.\nSimulataneous gas and electromagnetic sealing usually calls for an electro-\n\n346\n\nmagnetic seal and a separate pressure\nseal. This, in turn, requires two or more\nmachining operations in each of the\nsealing flanges and the maintenance of\nnearly-perfect sealing surfaces. Because precise, near-zero gap alinement\nhas to be maintained, the electromagnetic seal sometimes prevents the\nproper setting of the pressure seal.\n\nA better approach is to use a conductive elastomer that simultaneously seals\nagainst gas and electromagnetic leakage. Heretofore, commercially-available\nconductive elastomers have been made\nof silicone rubber impregnated with\nmetallic particles.

Thus the ampoule would not burst, while the ampoule charge would reach the temperature necessary to promote the desired\nreaction or physical change.\nThe essential elements of the heating system are shown in the figure. A\nscreen, made of the same material as\nthat of the ampoule, is placed between\nthe ampoule and the furnace lining. A\ncooling gas or other fluid flows between\nthe screen and the ampoule.\nThe furnace is raised to a high temperature at which the ampoule material\nis transparent to much of the blackbody radiation from the furnace lining.\nThe portion of the radiation to which the\nampoule is opaque is absorbed by the\nscreen. Most of the radiation that\npasses through the screen also passes\nthrough the ampoule and into the\ncharge, thus heating the charge.\nThe cooling fluid removes the heat\nabsorbed by the screen and maintains\nthe outside of the ampoule at a temperature below the softening point. The inside of the ampoule in contact with the\n\n1,600\'\n1.400\xc2\xb7C\n\ncharge may therefore be above the\nsoftening temperature while the outside remains strong enough to keep its\nshape and to prevent bursting.\nFused silica is essentially transparent to radiation of wavelength shorter\nthan 3.7 microns. At 1,600\xc2\xb0 C, more\nthan 75 percent of blackbody radiation\nwill pass through. In an ampoule of this\nmaterial, it should be possible to use\nthe 1,600\xc2\xb0 C radiation to heat a charge\nbeyond the 1,300\xc2\xb0 C softening temperature. The outside of the ampoule\nwould be kept rigid by cooling it to\n1,000\xc2\xb0 C.

Reaction to these loads\ncauses the seat and occupant to move\nforward and downward. A new yielding\ntorque-tube system limits these loads\nand minimizes injuries. When properly\nintegrated into the seat structure, the\ntorque tube yields in the plastic deforma\xc2\xb7\ntion stage of the material and maintains\na relatively constant resistance to applied torque for many degrees of rota\xc2\xb7\ntion .\nBy properly sizing and selecting\nmaterial for the yielding torque-tube\nsystem, it is possible to limit the loads to\nthe occupant throughout the allowable\nmovement of the seat. By utilizing the\nyielding torque tube as a pivot point for\nthe legs of the seat, load response can\nbe controlled in a predictable way.

The new algorithm has\nbeen tested in the computation of axially\ndirected flow about a blunt body\nhaving a shape similar to that of such\npractical bodies as wide-body aircraft or\nartillery shells.\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are differential equations that provide a comprehensive model for compressible, viscous flow in a nonchemically reacting\nfluid. Conservation equations (for mass,\nenergy, and momentum) and equations\nof state (relating pressure, temperature,\nand density) are incorporated, along\nwith relationships giving the specific\nheats and viscosity parameters of the\nfluid.\nBecause of the complexities of applying the equations to hypersonic flow\nabout realistic, blunt bodies, approximate analytical techniques are inadequate, and numerical techniques must\nbe used. A suitably-formulated numerical method should be able to predict the\nconditions everywhere in the flow field,\nincluding the bow-shock region that divides the flow field into regions\nof supersonic and subsonic flows.\nThe improved computational method\nbegins with the transformation of the\nNavier-Stokes equations from Cartesian\ncoordinates to a boundary-fitted curvilinear coordinate system for the prescribed body and boundary shapes. The\ntransformat ion is performed by\nthe basic relations of tensor analysiS.\nIn the case of a two-dimensional flow\nfield, the curvilinear coordinates map\nonto a rectangular grid in the transformed plane (see figure). Since the\nbody and outer boundary become\nstraight lines in the transformed plane,\nthe statement of boundary conditions is\ngreatly simplified. In addition , this\nmethod of generating coordinates easily\nallows coordinate lines to be concentrated in a dense mesh so as to capture\nthe details of regions of large flow gradients, such as boundary layers and\nshock waves.\n\nPHYSICAL PLANE\n\nr\'2\n\'1 - \'100\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nJ\n\nI r\'3\nI\n\nJ\nr\'l\n\nTRANSFORMED PLANE\n\nA Curvilinear Coordinate System based on the shape of the body and of the outer boundary is used to simplify the calculations. In the two-dimensional case shown here, the\ntransformed Navier-Stokes equations are expressed in the transformed coordinates ~ ,r).\nThe curved physical boundaries r become straight lines ro in the transformed\ncoordinates.\n\nThe transformed equations retain the\nconservation-law form of the original\nequations. The differential equations are\nreplaced by second-order-accurate\nfinite-difference approximations that\nproduce a set of implicit finite-difference\nequations. The set is solved by the\nmethod of successive overrelaxation iteration, which allows for the introduction\n\nof an artificial viscosity term to damp\nnumerical (but nonphysical) instabilities.\n(Numerical instabilities often characterize finite-difference approximations.)\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are\nsolved for all points in the field; that\nis, on both sides of the bow shock and\nwithin the shock region as well. This is\nin contrast to previous methods in which\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalilWlnter 1981\n\n357\n\nthe shock has been treated as a\nsharp boundary across which the solutions for the separated regions had to be\nfitted via the Rankine-Hugoniot shock\nrelations.\nThe improved method was applied to\naxisymmetric flow of a perfect viscous\ngas about a circular cylinder with hemispherical end caps. Calculations of pressure, temperature, density, and velocity\nfields for the axisymmetric case provide\ninitial data for eventual extension to\n\nthree-dimensional flow (e.g., nonzero\nangle of attack).\nThe method offers significant computational advantages because of the conservation-law form of the equations and\nbecause it reduces the amount of metric\ndata required. A major difficulty was\nfound to lie in choosing an initial guess\nthat would remain stable and converge\nto a realistic solution. Numerical instabilities persist, although the approach\n\nused seems promising. Finally, a morerefined mesh system has been proposed to increase the accuracy of the\nsolution in the shock region.\n\nThis work was done by Z. U. A. Warsi,\nR. A. Weed, and J. F.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nIn a proposed solution to the problems of frequent software releases and\nupdates, the documentation would be\ndivided into smaller packages, each of\nwhich contains data relating to only\none of several software components.\nChanges would not affect the entire\ndocument.\nThe new approach is in response to\nthe needs of the Launch Processing\nSystem Checkout and Control Subsystem , but it should also be applicable to\nother large systems. The user documentation published in support of this\nsystem totals approximately 2,700\npages. These pages comprise 14 user\ndocuments. The most active of these is\nthe System Operation document of 800\npages.\nSoftware deliveries are generated\nand released approximately once per\nmonth. "Redlined pages" are subsequently copied, and a small distribution\nis made coincident with each software\nrelease. The redlined pages are generated in lieu of formally published documentation, since the size of existing\ndocuments and frequency of software\nrelease prohibit the handling of large\ndocumentation revisions on a once-permonth production basis.\nThe problems inherent with copies of\nredlined pages are as follows:\n-Copy quality is poor and difficult to\nread.\n-The distribution of redlined pages creates a storage and maintenance problem, since when redlined data are\nplaced in existing documents, they\ntend to mask out existing data.\n\n358\n\nNEW\nPACKAGES\n\nCOMPLETE DATA PACKAGE\nFIE\nI\n\nPACKAGE X\nFIE\n033\xc2\xb7 \'\nLIST OF PACKAGE EFFECTIVITY\nBASELINE FlO FIE\n\nI\n\nSYSTEM OPERATION\nUSER UPDATES\n\nI~- I*\n\nEFFECTIVITY\nLIST OF PAGES\n\n-----\n\nTHIS PACKAGE TO BE USED\nWITH\nRELEASE ONLY\n\n"\n\nFIE\n\n1111111111\n\nDATE\n\n------\n\nFIE\n\n~\n\nI\nI\n\n*I\n\n1111111111\n\nr-\n\nII-\n\nINDIVIDUAL PACKAGE STRUCTURE/\n\nUser\xc2\xb7 Documentation Updates according to the new approach would be released as small\npackages of formal documentation relating to specific software components.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FallIWlnter 1981\n\n-Redllned pages create a configurationmanagement problem since no formal\ndocumentation update is made coincident with the release.\n-The redlined pages are held in a Pending Publication file until a sufficient\nquantity (25 percent) of pages has\nchanged to warrant a formal publication of the documentation.\nIn the new approach, each user package describes only one major user function. Each is marked to permit easy identification of the software release described within the package (see figure).\nCaution statements are located on the\n\nContents page of the package to advise\nthe potential user of the applicable software release described within the\npackage.\nAn appropriate packaging configuration is established for each document\nat the time it is first released. As\nsubsequent software releases occur,\nnew or modified software capabilities\nare documented by updating the appropriate documentation packages. These\npackages are produced as formal documentation. Each is printed, distributed,\nand configuration-oontrolled as an individual entity. To provide package con-\n\ntrol, a list of packages is provided that informs the user of the specific effectivity\nof each package associated with the\nspecific document.\nThe concept would improve the dissemination of information regarding\nchanges and would improve the quality\nof the data supporting the packages. It\nwould thus help to insure both timeliness\nand a more thorough scrutiny of the\nchanges.\nThis work was done by R. Humphrey\nof International Business Machines\nCorp. for Kennedy Space Center.

The model format/approach is dependent upon the use of\nsubsystem cost-estimating relationships\n(CER\'s) in devising a cost-effective\npolicy.\nThe objectives of a reliability/cost\nmodel would normally include the provision of one or more of the following :\n- Means to forecast effects on the reliability of the overall system of changes\nin reliability/cost relationships of the\nsubsystems;\n- Means to allocate programed increases or decreases in the cost/reliability function of the whole system\namong the various subsystems; and\n- System methodology to evaluate the\ncost effectiveness of alternate system\nconfigurations or operating plans.\nThe CER must be established for each\nsubsystem from technical reliability and\ncost experiences with the subsystem.\nThe example in the figure illustrates\ntypical CER\'s with relative-cost-versusreliability plots for the electrical subsystems of two types of spacecraft. The\nselection of a representative set of subsystem CER\'s (from the electrical subsystem, mechanical subsystem, and so\nforth) is up to the decisionmaker, as long\nas the overall model constraints and requirements are met and as long as the\nCER\'s are mathematically well behaved.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, FalllWlnter 1981\n\n5.0\n\nEOS\n\ncr.\n~2.0\n\n~\n\nIii\n\n81\n.01-- _____~,....~-----\n\no\n\n0.2 0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n0.99\n\nEFFECTIVE RELIABILITY (RE)\n\nTypical Cost\xc2\xb7Versus\xc2\xb7Rellablllty Curves Illustrate the concept of subsystem costestimating relationships (CER\'s) essential to the method. These curves are for the electrical subsystems of two types of spacecraft.\n\nThe representative set of CER\'s is\nused to form a characteristic master\ncost-versus-reliability function for the\nwhole system. The overall cost figure of\nmerit (a relative measure of total system\ncost) is taken as a geometric, rather\nthan an arithmetic, sum of subsystem\ncosts. This multiplicative format tends to\nembed each of the participating variables, minimizing unknown or indeterminate influences and interactions among\nand within the various subsystems.\n\nThe proposed methodology should\nhave application in the broad range of\nengineering management decisions. By\norganizing the data requirements and\nclarifying the assumptions to be made, it\ncan help in the development of costeffectiveness and reliability relationships. Model users should be able to\npredict the marginal effect on the\nreliability of a system from increases or\ndecreases in the resources allocated to\nreliability.\n(continued on next page)\n\n359\n\nThis work was done by Leon M.\nDelionback of Marshall Space flight\nCenter.

This is accomplished by first estimating the autocovariance function of\nthe variable and then taking the FFT of\nthe smoothed autocovariance function\nto obtain the PDS. The PDS program is\ntransparent to the ACSL run-time executive (Le., the time history of the reo\ncorded variable is replaced by its PDS)\nso that the ACSL user can perform a frequency analysis from the time-domain\nACSL simulation model.\nEngineering models are often developed with the aid of digital computer\nsimulation programs. One of these programs is the ACSL which models the behavior of the continuous systems de\xc2\xb7\nscribed by time\xc2\xb7dependent, nonlinear\ndifferential equations and transfer functions. The inputs to ACSL are in two distinct groups: The first group contains\n\n360\n\nthose inputs concerned with defining\nthe model or structure of the system\nbeing simulated; the second group contains the sequence of commands that\nexecute this model, such as change pa\xc2\xb7\nrameters, start runs, and plot data. One\nof the outputs of ACSL can be the time\nhistory of specified dynamic variables,\nsampled at regular intervals and stored\non a mass storage device. This record\nmay be compared with the behavior of\nthe physical system to determine the fidelity of the mathematical engineering\nmodel.\nThe accuracy of the engineering\nmodel may also be verified by the use of\npower-density-spectrum analysis. The\nPDS of the model can be calculated and\nthen compared with an experimentally\nmeasured PDS of the physical system.\nOne method used in the past to do this\nutilizes a numerical quadrature procedure, to calculate the complex\nFourier integral, at a number of se\xc2\xb7\nlected frequencies. If a complex system\nwere being analyzed or a large number\nof frequencies were required to define\n\nthe PDS, the numerical quadrature\nmethod could use a substantial amount\nof computer resources.\nThe new program utilizes a fast-Fourier-transform technique to estimate\nthe PDS of the model. Because of the efficiency of the FFT, the program should\nrequire less computer resources than\nother methods. The program is an ex\xc2\xb7\ntension of the ACSL system so that the\nPDS analysis can be performed as part\nof the ACSL sequence of commands\nthat exercise the model.\nThis work was done by Henry J. Dunn\nof Langley Research Center. Further\ninformation may be found in NASA\nTM\xc2\xb783120 [N81-25699INSP].
