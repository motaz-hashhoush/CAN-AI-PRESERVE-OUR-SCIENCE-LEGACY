The anticipated output is 20 mJ per 10 picosecond pulse, running at a repetition rate of 40 Hz. The fundamental wavelength is at 1047 nm. The oscillator is pumped by a single laser diode bar and mode locked using an electro-optic, intra-cavity phase modulator. The output from the oscillator is injected as a seed into the regenerative amplifier. The regenerative amplifier laser crystal is optically pumped by two 60W quasi-cw laser diode bars. Each diode is collimated using a custom designed micro-lens bar. The injected 10 ps pulse from the oscillator is kept circulating within the regenerative amplifier until this nanojoule level seed pulse is amplified to 2-3 millijoules. At this point the pulse is ejected and sent on to a more standard single pass amplifier where the energy is boosted to 20 mJ. The footprint of the entire laser (oscillator-regenerative amplifier-amplifier) will fit on a 3 by 4 ft. optical pallet.", "title": "Nd:YLF laser for airborne/spaceborne laser ranging", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940011090, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dallas, Joseph L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "ceb5386d0f90442baa87bc293b8c3b8c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940011090, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Selker, Mark D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "d6a75c2733144b8f8fa88695cc092e8c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940011090, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940011090, "id": "505e02291f244cbcba6cc2bffd01af39", "publicationName": "Eighth International Workshop on Laser Ranging Instrumentation", "publicationDate": "1993-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940011090.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940011090/downloads/19940011090.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940011090/downloads/19940011090.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940011090/downloads/19940011090.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
