Analyses and hypervelocity impact testing results are described that have been used in developing the shields and equations. Spacecraft shielding design and operational practices described in this report are used to provide effective spacecraft protection from meteoroid and debris impacts. Specific shield applications for the International Space Station (ISS), Space Shuttle Orbiter and the CONTOUR (Comet Nucleus Tour) space probe are provided. Whipple, Multi-Shock and Stuffed Whipple shield applications are described.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030068423, "id": "8c19f8513dac45b48a8bd257f17743f8", "publicationDate": "2003-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030068423.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030068423/downloads/20030068423.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030068423/downloads/20030068423.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030068423/downloads/20030068423.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
