Physiological concerns include the loss of bone structural strength, the long-term effects of zero-gravity, the role of inert gases in breathing, and the danger of slow cosmic-ray particles. With reference to the administration of space habitats, it is suggested that initially Intelsat might serve as a model for supranational sponsorship. Later it is envisioned that space habitats will have some autonomy but will still be subject to earth control; habitats will not wage war on earth or on each other; and that the habitats will be protected from any adverse developments that might occur on earth.", "title": "Human factors", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T00:44:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19770052977, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Billingham, J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, Calif., United States"}}, "id": "36c0a1b135964de98956eac9e5148442"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19770052977, "endDate": "1975-05-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Princeton Conference on Space manufacturing facilities: Space colonies", "location": "Princeton, NJ", "id": "34b1db68276848e49776f9459d521fc2", "startDate": "1975-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19770052977, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770052977, "id": "d41ae711389c46f3bad7f945caaa41f5", "publicationDate": "1977-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
