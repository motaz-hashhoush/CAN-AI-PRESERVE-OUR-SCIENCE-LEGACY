James A. Lovell, USN 0Ret.)\nCommander,\nApollo 13\n\n11\n\nDR. BUZZ ALDRIN: It is my great pleasure to be here\nto pay tribute to the fine Apollo 13 team--several\nof\nwhom have just arrived through the generosity of\nRockwell, the marvel of modern space transportation\nand, of course, the theatrical prowess of the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.\nIt is appropriate that Rockwell play a key role in\nthis tribute, because it had such a fundamental role in\nthe Apollo program 25 years ago. Now, as our\nHYSTAR delivery system departs, I am truly honored\nto introduce to you some of the key participants of that\ndramatic Apollo 13 mission that caused America to\nhold its collective breath until the astronauts were\nsafely back on Earth.\nFirst, and I say first because they did come before\nthe astronauts,\nand none of us could have performed\nour missions without the incredibly talented mission\ncontrol teams: Glynn Lunny, flight director of the\nBlack Team, who worked closely with the other flight\ndirectors; Gene Kranz; Gerry Griffen; and Milt Windler, who led everyone in mission control in coming up\nwith the solutions to every challenge that mission\noffered.\nNext, representing\nAstronaut and Colorado\nCongressman\nJack Swigert, who unfortunately\ndied of\ncancer in 1983, is his sister Virginia Swigert. Finally,\nthe commander\nof the Apollo 13 mission, a good\nfriend and one of my personal heroes, Captain Jim\nLovell, United States Navy (Retired). He joined\nNASA in 1962 and flew a total of four missions before\nhis retirement in 1973. The crew of Apollo 8--America\'s first mission to the moon--was\nnamed "Time\'s\nMen of the Year."\nCaptain Loveli holds a bachelor of science from\nthe U.S. Naval Academy and eight honorary\ndoctorates from such schools as Blackburn University,\nRockhurst College and Milwaukee School of\nEngineering.\nHis honors include the Presidential\nMedal for Freedom; the NASA Distinguished\nService\nMedal, twice; and two Navy Distinguished\nFlying\nCrosses.\nLadies and gentlemen, astronaut and true\nAmerican hero, Jim Lovell.\nCAPT. JIM LOVELL: Thank you, Buzz, and I\nappreciate your introduction\nof some of the great team\nmembers that made the return of Apollo 13 possible.\nMy hat is off to you too, for over the years you have\ncontinued to promote our space activities. You and\n\nSpeaker:\n\nyour teammates occupy a great place in history, and\nwhat a boost that Apollo 11, our first moon landing,\ngave to America in so many ways.\nI wish that my crewmate, Fred Haise, could join\nme tonight. But Fred is still actively involved in the\naerospace business and had a previous commitment.\nToday gave me a chance to renew acquaintances\nwith a few members of the Apollo 13 team, and I am,\nnaturally, very proud of all the men and women who\nworked on that flight and were responsible for our safe\nreturn. And we are all proud of the thousands of\ntalented and dedicated people who continue to push the\nboundaries\nof space today.\nOn behalf of all those involved in America\'s\nspace\nprograms,\nI would like to thank the United States\nSpace Foundation for the important work it does in\npromoting national awareness and support for\nAmerica\'s\nspace endeavors. It is indeed an honor to be\na part of this event tonight.\n\nMercury,\n\nGemini,\n\nand Apollo missions\n\nwere\n\nnot just about beating the Soviets to the\nmoon.\n\nThey also were about challenging\n\nthis\n\nnation to do the hard things that would make\nit great and keep it great.\n\nIt is particularly\nsignificant and appropriate that\nthe United States Space Foundation host this tribute\nbecause when it was founded in 1983, it was dedicated\nto the memory of my crewmate, Colorado\nCongressman\nand astronaut Jack Swigert.\nIt was Jack who first suggested we put down on\npaper the perilous saga of the 13th flight. Shortly after\nthe mission, he visited with the author Ernest Gann,\nan aviation adventure writer. Gann suggested an\noutline on structuring the story. Jack faithfully made\ncopies and sent them to Fred and myself. But the best\nintentions are often forgotten as we drifted into\ndifferent careers. It wasn\'t until I retired the second\ntime that I remembered\nthe promise to write the story.\nJack was the motivator when I started to do research\nfor the book and look back on the heady days of\nAmerica\'s early space program.\n\n11TI-I\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nI think it is important to remember what was\ndriving us so hard.\nMercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions were not\njust about beating the Soviets to the moon. They also\nwere about challenging this nation to do the hard\nthings that would make it great and keep it great. The\nchallenge by President Kennedy marshaled the best\nany country in the world had to offer in those\ndays--government,\nindustry, and academia--and\ninspired magnificent achievements\nin science,\ntechnology,\nhealth, and education.\nThat challenge also\ncreated a unity and national pride that had never been\nachieved in peacetime before or, regrettably,\nsince.\nThe Apollo 13 mission that riveted the world\'s\nattention for several days was not just about a handful\nof people trying to save three astronauts.\nIt was about\nsomething much larger than that. It was about\nAmerican resolve and resourcefulness\nin the face of\ncompeting beliefs. It was about the value this nation\nplaces on human life and its commitment to promises.\nIt was about trust. It was about courage--yes,\nto some\ndegree, at the personal level. But more importantly the\ncourage of our national leaders, first to make such an\noutlandishly visionary commitment to go to the moon,\nbut then to stick to it through some perilous trials.\nThat decision to send Apollo 8 to the moon was a bold\nmove.\n\nIf the day ever comes that the United States\nof America\nbecause\n\nis intimidated\n\nit was too risky---or\n\nexpensive_that\n\nThe leaders\n\nwill forever\n\nnation in modern\n\nwho make that decision\n\ncarry the burden of failed trust\n\nand broken promises.\nthe burden\n\ne.oo hard or too\n\nday will mark the final\n\ndecline of the greatest\nhistory.\n\nby failure and quits\n\nof forsaking\n\ngreat nation\'s\n\nThey also will carry\nthe heritage\n\npioneers\n\nof this\n\nof every era.\n\nRecall that the \'60s were not tranquil times. We\nhad a very unpopular\nwar in progress sapping\nenormous national resources.\nWe had civil rights and\nsocial upheaval. We had major nuclear threats with\n"mutual assured destruction"\nbreathing down our\nbacks everyday. There was unrest in the universities.\nAnd the hippie generation was lobbying hard to\nundermine the values that our nation was founded\nupon.\nYet we prevailed. We succeeded in the greatest\nachievements\nhumans have ever known. Not all\nmissions went as planned. One ended before it started\nwith the death of three of our close friends on the\nlaunch pad. Ours ended successfully\nback on Earth\n\nbut--much to my personal disappointment--not\non the\nmoon.\nBut we didn\'t quit. And thankfully we didn\'t quit\nafter the Challenger disaster either. And let\'s hope we\nwon\'t quit in the face of the next serious setback,\nbecause the human quest for knowledge will continue.\nThe only question is whether America will continue to\nbe a leader of that quest. Exploration,\npushing the\nboundaries of the unknown, will always be a\nhazardous proposition.\nAnd people will die pushing\nthose boundaries.\nLet me leave you with this thought. If the day ever\ncomes that the United States of America is intimidated\nby failure and quits because it was too risky--or\ntoo\nhard or too expensive--that\nday will mark the final\ndecline of the greatest nation in modern history. The\nleaders who make that decision will forever carry the\nburden of failed trust and broken promises.\nThey also\nwill carry the burden of forsaking the heritage of this\ngreat nation\'s pioneers of every era. Thank you.\nFeatured\n\nSpeaker\n\nDR. FRANCE CORDOVA\nNASA Chief Scientist\nWe are seeing a lot of profound changes going on\nat NASA these days. The one that I want to talk about\nthis evening is how NASA is setting its course for the\nfuture. With all the reinventing,\ndownsizing,\nand\nstreamlining,\nwhere is it that we are going? Do we\nhave a compelling vision for our next era in space?\nIn the past, the approach to the future was driven\nby competition with the Soviet Union. NASA\'s feats\nwere ones of technical daring-do,\ndesigned to show\nsuperior competence in engineering.\nAll this changed\nwith the end of the Cold War. Today we are in the\nprocess of formulating\na vision for the future that is\ndriven by the search for answers to fundamental\nquestions about planet Earth, its neighborhood--the\nsolar systems, and the universe..,\nand by\nfundamental\nquestions about ourselves, the origin of\nlife, and the possibility of finding other planets that are\nalive. We still need to demonstrate\nexcellence in\nengineering,\nbut we need to do this to accomplish our\nscientific goals, not just to demonstrate\ntechnical\nsuperiority.\nWe realize that we can do much more in\npartnership:\nat home, by uniting federal government\nwith industry and academia, and abroad, by forming\ninternational\nalliances. Instead of talking about\ncompeting with Russia, we are looking for more ways\nto collaborate with her and with many other countries.\nHow are we building a road map for the future?\nOne of our ways is quite extraordinary,\nand it is this\nway that I want to share with you. NASA headquarters\nsits adjacent to a huge highway in southwest\nWashington,\nD.C. It\'s a block-long,\nunmemorable\nbuilding containing only offices, almost all of the\nmodular and gray. It\'s not a work of art.

It is here that\nonce a month the administrator\nof NASA, Mr. Daniel\nGoldin, has been inviting leading scientists,\ntheologians,\nhistorians,\nand other thinkers to discuss\nwhat would be a significant agenda for America\'s\nnext\nera in space, an agenda that is both profound in its\nsearch for truth, compelling because of its far reach,\nand inspiring to the public. We are only a third of the\nway through this year-long exploratory\nprocess, but\nalready we are starting to see a road map taking shape.\nIt is unusual, perhaps unprecedented,\nfor a federal\nagency to engage in anything like an intellectual dialog\nwith itself and its customers--and\nto expect that that\ndialog will lead to a driving vision for the next\ncentury.\nWhat are we learning? First, we find that our view\nof the universe has changed greatly in the last 60 years\nsince Edwin Hubble discovered the recession of the\ngalaxies, that they were all moving away from each\nother, that the universe was expanding and was 10 to\n20 billion years old. His discovery was an incredible\nchange in our worldview,\na change as profound as the\n\nFigure\nvariables\n\n0C-4:\n\nSpace\nHubble\n\nin another\n\nTelescope\nSpace\ngalaxy\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wide\nTelescope\n\ngives\n\nField Planetary\nobservations\n\nus clues\n\nto age\n\nCamera\nof\n\nof\n\nthe\n\n2\n\nCepheid\nuniverse\n\nCopernican\nrevolution.\nWe have a fancy name for a worldview,\nwe call it\ncosmology because it deals with our myth for the\norigin and workings of the cosmos at large. At the\ntime of Edwin Hubble, a half century ago, we believed\nthat the cosmos was homogeneous,\nuniform, isotropic.\nBut today, our worldview is undergoing\nanother\nprofound change. As a result of applying new large\ntelescopes to the study of the universe--telescopes\non\nthe ground and in space--and\ntechniques like adaptive\noptics, we have recently discovered that the universe is\nclumpy. Huge sectors of it are moving in specific\ndirections because of gravity (Fig. 0C-1).\nWith new, much more precise measurements,\nall\nof our cherished concepts and numbers are challenged.\nWe have less confidence, not more, about the true\nsize, age, and density of the universe, whether it will\ncontinually\nexpand or slow down and will eventually\nclose in on itself. We don\'t understand why the\nuniverse is clumpy, why there are galaxies and clusters\nof galaxies, why the radiation left over from the Big\nBang that was its origin is so smoothly distributed\n(Fig. 0C-2). We used to think that the galaxies were\nfar apart from each other; now we appreciate that,\n3\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nFigure\n\n0C-5:\n\nmission\n\nwill\n\nearly\n\nin the\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nNASA\'s\nprobe\nnext\n\nand\n\nl"ttan for\n\nESA\'s\nsigns\n\nCassini\nof\n\ncentury.\n\nrelative to the scale of the universe, they are so close\nthat they bang into each other and produce weird\nshapes and patterns of radiation (Fig. 0C-3). We\nrecently discovered that the universe appears to be\nyounger than the stars that fill it--a notion that hardly\nmakes sense until you realize that, with all our new\ntechnologies,\nour measurements\nstill lack precision\n\n(Fig. 0C-4).\nThere are four numbers we would like to know:\nthe amount of matter in the universe, the energy\ndensity of the vacuum that is space, the Hubble\nconstant, and the transverse motions of the galaxies.\nThese four measurements\nare fundamental\nto our\nunderstanding\nof the birth and evolution of the\ncosmos. Yet we are far from being able to measure\nany of these fundamental\nparameters\nwell. We lack\naperture and we lack baseline, and with out this,\nwithout extremely large telescopes in a stable\nconfiguration\nin space, above the Earth\'s distorting\natmosphere,\nwe cannot see beyond the local\ndisturbances\nin the flow of galaxies, and we cannot\nmeasure precisely the tiny motions of stars in far-off\ngalaxies. The Hubble Space Telescope is a great\ntelescope, but a limited one. To do better, at an\naffordable price, we will have to find ways of building\nmuch larger, lighter telescopes,\na constellation\nof them\nspread over a great area of the sky (or the surface of\nthe moon) and carefully networked together to operate\nas one giant dish in space.\nSecond, we are learning about ourselves,\nwhat it\nmeans to be alive. If we are going to pioneer the solar\nsystem and beyond, it would be good to have a\ndefinition of what constitutes cellular life, and how we\nwould recognize signs of life elsewhere. Surely the\nknowledge that there is life elsewhere,\neither now or\nin the past, would revolutionize\nour view of ourselves\nin the Universe. Trying to answer the question of\nwhether or not there is life elsewhere used to be idle\nconjecture, but now we have the wherewithal\nto find\nout. We learned from our seminar speakers that one\n4\n\nFigure\n\n0C-6:\n\nHubble\n\nTelescope\n\nimage\n\nof Mars\n\nlife\n\nway to detect life is to look for organic molecules in\nsamples and to look for a degree of complexity that\ncould not arise by accident. We should look for a\nlarge number of equivalent molecules (on the basis that\nthis would not be an accident) or polymers of a\ndefined signature coming up frequently--in\nother\nwords, look for non-random phenomena\nas a sign of\nlife.\nWhere should we look for signs of life? Our\nexperts favored taking samples from Mars and looking\nfor fossil evidence of organic chemicals.\nTitan, the\nmoon of Saturn, is another possibility,\nas is a comet,\nwhich is made of the material that was early Earth\n(Fig. 0C-5). Some scientists make the case that life is\na planetary phenomenon\nand grows exponentially\nunder the right conditions.\nAll our experts agreed that\nif you have the right environment,\nlife will appear\nvery quickly, and there is ample evidence on our own\nplanet to show that this is true. There are, after all, 30\nmillion species on our planet, some with origins 3.5\nbillion years old. Interestingly,\nRNA sequencing\nshows that there is only one form of life on Earth; we\nare all made of the same stuff. Our common ancestor,\nwe learn from the experts, was a thermophytic\nsulfur\nbacterium!\nThe particular abundance of elements on the Earth\nis its signature of life, cell biologists and chemists\nargue. Earth differs from Mars and Venus in that it\nhas more oxygen, nitrogen, and water, and less carbon\ndioxide--and\nEarth is at room temperature.\nThey point\nout that it is nonhuman life that has changed our planet, that organisms regulate the planet and have made it\nwhat it is for 3,000 million years; these organisms\nremoved carbon dioxide and produced the large amount of oxygen we have. Life will grow and grow\nand expand, given only water and food to reproduce.\nThese organisms have made the air and soil suitable\nfor human life.\nOn any other planet that has signs of life we\nshould expect again to find life as an integrated,\nwhole\nplanet system. This requires carbon, nitrogen, sulfur,\nand water. The search for life on other planets is\n\nOPENINO\n\nFigure\n\n0C-7."\n\nHubble\n\nTelescope\n\nimages\n\nof protoplanetary\n\nCEREMONY\n\nnebulae\n\nequivalent to searching for liquid water. Our task\nshould be to measure the surface temperature of\nplanetary bodies at microwave wavelengths\nto see if\nthere is\nliquid water. Mars could be habitable but isn\'t (Fig.\n0C-6). It may have had liquid water in the past, but\nit\'s gone now. Mars is much smaller than the Earth.\nThere are no active plate tectonics, and it can\'t\nmaintain the dynamic interactions that Earth can.\nDo we have to limit our search for signs of life to\nour own solar system? Do we have evidence of other\nsolar systems? Our first real evidence that these\nprobably exist came in 1983 with observations\nby\nNASA\'s Infrared Astronomy Satellite, IRAS, which\ndiscovered\ninfrared-emitting\n"fuzz" around the images of nearby\nstars. More recently the Hubble Space Telescope has\nimaged clearly a stellar nursery called the Orion\nNebula and discovered that about 50 percent of the\nstars have disks of gas around them that could be solar\nsystems in the making (Fig. 0C-7). With present\ntechnology,\nespecially speckle interferometry,\nwe\ncould probably image Jupiters around other solar\nsystems from the ground. With space technology,\nwe\ncould image earths orbiting other suns.\nWe have the beginnings of a road map. We have\nsigns of life to search for, and we have identified\nplaces that could enable this exploration.\nOn the\nMoon a wide, stable interferometer\ncould be placed to\nimage distant earths and to use as a jumping off point\nfor Mars, where robots or humans will search for\nevidence of fossil life. An interferometer\nwith large\naperture, dishes could also be used to measure with\nmuch greater precision the vital statistics of the\ncosmos: How big is it? How old is it? What was its\nbeginning? What is its end? These two explorations\nhave a connection--ourselves:\nWhy are we here? What\nis our purpose? Historians tell us that these are\nquestions that ancient civilizations not only asked\nthemselves,\nbut built elaborate cosmologies\nto answer.\nInterestingly,\nthe difference, for example, between\ntheir cosmologies\nand ours is that theirs were founded\n\nFigure\n\n0C-8:\n\ngenerated\nviewed\n\nDr.\n\nimage\nat\n\nRobert\nof an\n\n10 parsec\n\nBrown\'s\nEarth-like\n\nwith\n\ndifferent\n\ncomputerplanet\nresolutions\n\non images with which every man, woman, and child\ncould easily connect (take the Mayan metaphor of the\nMilky Way as a canoe), whereas ours are abstracted\ninto numbers like omega, lambda, and H-naught.\nIs this vision realizable? Can we hope, for\nexample, to identify an earth orbiting another star? Or\nquantify the numbers that underpin our cosmology?\nYes, it is! Right now scientists and engineers are\nforming teams to study the new technologies\nthat we\nwill need: nonlinear optics, hyperspectral\nsensors,\nadaptive optics, laser ranging, interferometers,\nmethods for precise station keeping.\nIt will take an\nintegrated, multidisciplinary\neffort, but that is something that NASA is good at. Only NASA looks at the\nwhole planet, not the separate disciplines of biology,\ngeology, physics, etc., and it is this unified approach\nthat we\'ll need to accomplish our ambitious goal.\nwhat is the challenge? Look at this slide (Fig. 0C-8).\nThe technical challenge is great, but we see its\npossibility and you see its power.\nOur dialog on NASA\'s next era in space is just\nbeginning. Having looked at some issues in biology,\nplanetary science, and astrophysics,\nwe are now\nplanning to take a closer look at the science of the\nEarth. We want to understand\nmuch better the impact\nnatural and human factors have had on our planet.\nThat\'s the motivation for our mission to planet Earth.\nIt turns out that we know more about the sun--and\nsome of the nearby planets,\ntheir atmospheres\nand\nchemistry and landscapes--than\nwe do about our own\nplanet Earth. Ironically,\nit was our voyages outward,\nto the Moon and the planets, that made us look at our\nown planet in an entirely new way. We had not\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nFigure\n\nFigure\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\n0C-9\n\n0C-10\n\nconsidered remotely sensing ourselves! Our view of\nEarth from the shuttle shook us up (Figs. OC 9-13).\nOur vision is that we learn to be excellent\ncaretakers of our global backyard for future\ngenerations.\nTo do this we will need to understand\nhow all the parts are related to the whole. And this\nwill require a vast information\nnetwork. This slide\n(Fig. 0C-14) reveals a world with a digital pulse, a\nworld aware of itself.\nAnd, finally, in our dialog through the remainder\nof this year, we will explore our own role in this\nadventure. What will human beings do in space?\nPerhaps we\'ll need human beings because we\'ve\nalways been adventurers,\nbecause we can make\ndecisions machines can\'t and because we can do\nchallenging space experiments\nthat require the skill of\na surgeon. Perhaps we need to involve machines that\nhave consciousness,\nand that can live longer than a\nhuman life span. Our dialog at NASA will take us into\nthe science of consciousness\nand the new technologies\nlife and medical sciences are offering that may enable\nsome progeny of ourselves, a mating of human and\nmachine, to explore beyond our solar system.\nTo get ready to explore and utilize space, we use\nthe space shuttle as a laboratory and, soon, we will\n6\n\nFigure\n\nFigure\n\nOC-11\n\n0C-12\n\nenjoy the much longer duration laboratory capability\nof the Space Station. On planet Earth we are 5 billion\nastronauts on a space ship hurtling through space at\n500,000 miles per hour. Our spaceship experiences\nprecisely one "g." But we can alter gravity, one of\nnature\'s four forces, by going into space. This\nprofound capability allows us to explore the natural\nworld that we take for granted, including our own\nbodies and\ncommon processes,\nin a much different way, allowing\nus insight into physics that are masked on Earth by the\neffects of gravity. On the shuttle we have investigated\nthe behavior of living cells, fluids, proteins, and\nprocesses like combustion and phase transitions in a\nmuch reduced gravity. We\'ve been encouraged by our\nsuccesses and the interest of industry in this research.\nWe envision that space is slowly transforming\ninto the\nprovince of not just a few, but of many.\nWe hope that the end of our search for an\nintegrating agenda in space will bring us a new vision\nof what is possible, and new ideas about the\ntechnologies\nwe will need to achieve this vision. We\nwant it to be a distinctly human vision, one that\nsatisfies a need that is deep in the psyche of most of\nus. We want to leave the legacy that a young\n\nOPENINO\n\nFigure\n\nFigure\n\n0C-13\n\n0C-14\n\nastronomer,\nDr. Can Lester at UT Austin, talked\nabout when he recently testified before Congress:\n"The heritage that we leave for future generations\nis\nnot just knowledge of the scale of the universe, or\nevidence for black holes in the hearts of galaxies, but\nthe spirit of exploration of the world around us. For it\nis this spirit of exploration,\nand the curiosity that\ndrives it, that is one of our most profound national\nneeds. A nation that stops exploring is a nation that\ncannot produce the scientists and technologists\nthat we\nso desperately need to be competitive\nin the global\neconomy, and to improve the human condition.\nFederally funded scientific research is a contract with\nthe U.S. taxpayer not only to create new products, but\nto satisfy the national curiosity about the world in\nwhich we live. It is a fundamental\nelement in the\nfederal investment portfolio that ensures our leadership\nin the world."\nI\'d like to close by showing you this portrait of a\ncluster of galaxies (Fig. 0C-15). This is a multitude of\nMilky Ways, each the host of 10 billion stars. Ten\nbillion galaxies in our Universe times ten billion starts\nin each--and\nyet we know of only one solar system\nand only one life-bearing\nplanet (Fig. 0C-16). To\nview ourselves, our home, from a remote suburb in\n\nFigure\n\n0C-15\n\nFigure\n\nC F..RF_ONY\n\n0C-16\n\nspace--and\nto view the evolution of the Universe back\nto nearly its origins--these\nare remarkable\ncapabilities\nthat empower us to continually\nrenew our view of our\nown purpose on this planet and our final connection\nwith the stars.\n\nWe hope that the end of our search for an\nintegrating\n\nagenda\n\nin space will bring us a\n\nnew vision of what is possible,\nabout the technologies\n\nand new ideas\n\nwe will need to\n\nachieve this vision.\n\nAcknowledgments--Thanks\nto our\nvisionaries"\nwho inspired this talk and\nand materials: Robert Brown, Anneila\nMcKay, Lynn Margulis, Leslie Orgel,\nBohdan Paczynski, Linda Schele, and,\nDaniel Goldin.\n\n"space\nprovided ideas\nSargent, Chris\nVera Rubin,\nespecially,\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nVisions\n\nSPACE\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nFuture\n\nMaster\nModerator:\n\nDavid L.

So, where do we go\nnext? Over the last 11 years the U.S. Space Foundation has sponsored this, the National Space Symposium, to bring together the leaders of the world\'s\nmajor space organizations.\nThis year\'s symposium is\nno exception. We have gathered an unprecedented\nassembly of the earth\'s space-faring\nleaders. Today\nand for the remainder of the week the sessions, forums, and exhibits here are designed to provide you\nwith visionary insights into the future and examine the\nmeans to make those a reality.\n\nToday we find the promise\nbecome\n\nimprove\n\nof space has\n\nreality as increasingly\n\nand more\n\npractical\n\nwe find more\n\napplications\n\nthe human condition\nour knowledge\n\nof space to\nand expand\n\nbase.\n\nIt is my great honor to serve as this year\'s program moderator for this premier space symposium\nhere in beautiful Colorado.

I will have the hook ready at all times. So,\njoin us on our odyssey as we examine Vision and\nReality: Face to Face.\nTo kick off our symposium,\nwe are very fortunate\nto have Dr. Moira Gurm who has been the producer\nand host of TechNation since 1987. TechNation is a\none-hour weekly public radio program which features\nconversations\nbetween Dr. Gunn and guests who\nrepresent the past, present, and future of technology\nand evaluations of its impact on our lives. This highly\nsuccessful program has spawned a series of public\ntelevision specials that are currently in production,\nand we are fortunate today\'s session will be among\nthem. Dr. Gunn is a former NASA engineer and\nscientist, who specialized in robotics systems and also\nsoftware development\nfor large scientific applications\nsuch as global weather and climate modeling and\nearthquake modeling and prediction\nas well. She\'s an\nadjunct professor at the University\nof San Francisco\nand holds a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering\nand a\nmaster of science in computer engineering\nfrom\nPurdue University.\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr.\nMoira Gunn.\nDR. GONN: Thank you and welcome to\nTechNation...Americans\nand Technology. Today is a\nspecial broadcast and that means that we all together\nare in that broadcast. First of all, it\'s both televised\nand on radio, and it can be heard over a number of\nvenues including NPR stations and PBS nationally,\nArmed Forces Radio and television internationally, as\nwell as Internet multi-casting and video services all\nthroughout the world. But the problem with any of\nthese broadcasts\nis that unless you are at the right\nplace at the right time you don\'t get to hear them or\n\nVISIONS\n\nFOR\n\nTHE\n\nFUTURE\n\nsee them. So, if you would like to have either a video\nor audiotape of this session, we have arranged through\nthe U.S. Space Foundation\nto provide that to you at\ncost. So you don\'t have to be searching all over the\nplace. This is a live taping before a studio audience.\nFirst of all, during the opening of the show we will\nneed some applause at various times; we\'ll have some\ncues now and at the end as well.\nLive from the National Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, I\'m Moira Gunn and this is\nTechNation...Americans\nand Technology.\nI\'d like to\nwelcome my guests today, in alphabetical order:\nApollo astronaut,\nspace pioneer and futurist, Buzz\nAldrin; commander of the Air University of the U.S.\nAir Force, Lt. General Jay Kelley; former deputy\nadministrator\nof NASA, former Secretary of the Air\nForce and currently a professor of aerospace engineering and engineering\nmechanics at the University of\nTexas, Dr. Hans Mark; long-time moderator of the\nInternet forum on computer-related\nrisks, and principal scientist of the computer science laboratory of SRI\nInternational,\nDr. Peter Neumann; and last, but certainly not least the director emeritus of the Lawrence\nLivermore\nLaboratory,\nDr. Edward Teller.\nGentlemen,\nthank you so much for joining me\ntoday. Now, it seems to me that the funding for space\nexploration\nwas fueled by either a stirring vision, like\nthe race to the moon, or a fear of threat such as the\nCold War. Lacking either, what are the major factors\nthat seem to be affecting space funding today, and\ngiven the real and inherent risk of such programs,\nhow much does the specter of risk affect that funding?\nDr. Mark, if you could start.\n\nI\'m not too sure that they are the principal motivators.\nSeems to me Joe-Bag-of-Doughnuts\nand his cup of\ncoffee standing in front of the Seven-Eleven\nis more\nconcerned with his quality of life. And if Joe, with his\ncup of coffee, doesn\'t understand\nwhat space activities\ndo for him and his way of life, I\'m not sure he\'s\ngoing to be interested in getting too deeply involved.\nSo down at Air University I think a lot about that. We\nthought a lot about that at Space Cast 2020. We\nthought about it from the perspective of education.\nThe U.S. Space Foundation\nis deeply involved in\nworking that problem specifically.\nWe noticed in\nSpace Cast 2020 that if we accomplished\nnothing else,\nif we didn\'t identify one single gadget, gizmo, or\ndoodad that did magnificent things, we were going to\nhave educated 120 Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps officers about space more than they ever\ndreamed in their lives. To go back and drive tanks,\ndrive ships, fly airplanes with a different perspective\nof what space could do for them. So I think education\nand helping people understand\nwhat space can bring to\nthem is perhaps a more important stimulus today.\n\nDR. MARK: First, I would argue that there is still a\nthreat. The dominant trend today is the proliferation\nof high technology weapons including nuclear weapons and launch vehicles around the world. Therefore,\nthe reasons related to national security and, more\nimportantly,\nworld security now for going into space\nare still there. I think they will still be the dominant\nreasons for developing space technology.\nRisk is inherently part of this; one has to make judgments and\nguesses that hopefully are right, but I believe that the\neventual creation of space-based\ndefensive systems on\na worldwide\nbasis is the most interesting prospect. If\nyou go to Europe today, people are concerned about\nthreats from North Africa; for example, missile\nthreats. These are things that will be done in the coming years and that I think will continue to be the dominant motivator for doing new technology in space.\n\nDR. Gtrr_:\n\nDR. Gtn_N: General Kelley, as the leader of the Space\nCast 2020 study, you must agree with that.\nGENERAL KELLEY l Well, not exactly, Moira. We\nneed to add a little controversy.\nCertainly a stirring\nvision and fear are great motivators.\nThey always\nhave been, always will be. But in today\'s environment\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2..\n\nthe reasons\n\nrelated\n\nand, more importantly,\n\nto national\n\nworld security\n\nfor going into space are still there.\nthey will still be the dominant\ndeveloping\n\nNow Buzz,\n\nsecurity\nnow\n\nI think\n\nreasons\n\nfor\n\nspace technology\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nwhat do you think?\n\nDR. ALDRIN: This is not controversy.\nboth of these gentlemen.\n\nI agree with\n\nDR. GUNN: Then never mind.\nDR. ALDRIN: However, having been there I think\nthere are a few other people in addition to Joe-sixpack who might want to dream about wanting to get\nthere sometime in the future. And that says we have\nto look beyond our nose; we have to look beyond just\nthe short-term objectives that may motivate our legislative people who allocate the funds. We have to look\nbeyond the next 10, 20 years, a generation,\na few\ngenerations of evolutionary\nvehicles.\nI think it has to\nmove in the direction of one day when there will be\ntourism in space. The vast billions of dollars that are\nspent on people enjoying once-in-a-lifetime\nopportunities. It will come, I\'m sure, and space will be a part\nof it.\nDR. Gor_:\n\nDr. Teller?\n\n1 ITH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\n\'FELLER"\nThere is a reason why I hesitate to\nbecome a space tourist. On my mother\'s 80th birthday, there was a great activity. People went all around\nthe world in space, and my mother exhibited an unusual interest in this technology. I did not know why.\nAnd when they finally were all safe, she turned to me\nwith a sigh, "But you will never do such a thing."\nAlso there are many things other than tourism that\nwe have to do. Defense is very important. Looking at\nthe Earth, we shall be able to understand the atmosphere and predict weather for two weeks. The rewards are enormous.\nI don\'t know how many of you know about the\nsmall object that was looking at the moon, then it was\ngetting away and gone forever. For that reason it was\ncalled Clementine.\nIt took almost two million pictures\nof the moon, and we now have as good a geography\nof the moon. I don\'t see how people can fail to be\ninterested in all the peculiar things that we find. These\nare exciting things that do not correspond to people\'s\nimmediate appetite for knowledge, but I predict that\nthis appetite will grow with the eating.\nDR.\n\nDR. GUNN: Now let me ask you, let me take another\nlittle turn here, because we\'ll come back to funding.\nI\'m very interested in looking at what we\'re doing in\nterms of humans in space, the risk that\'s involved,\nand how that\'s going to be affecting them. Peter, can\nyou start to talk about humans and risk and that kind\nof thing?\nDR. NEUMANN: Good. The first question here when\nwe\'re talking about outerspace is, of course, innerspace--what\'s\nhappening on the planet. As we try to\ndevelop systems that have very high requirements\nfor\nreliability, human safety, security, whatever, we find\nthat there are tremendous\ninnovations\nthat are emerging from the programs that NASA has undergone in\nthe past years, but there is still a lot that\'s left to do.\nOne of the risks is that we need to keep up not only\nthe education, because our future really depends on\nour young people and older people who are in need of\nretraining, but also the issue of research. There are\nproblems in dealing with complexity in very large\nsystems that must be dealt with very explicitly, and I\nthink this is something that we have to look at: What\nare the risks is certainly one of the questions. But,\nhow do you build systems that will avoid those risks?\nThis a very, very difficult problem we\'ve spent years\non in the research community,\nbut there is still a lot\nleft to do.\nDR. GUNN: Dr. Mark?\nDR. MARK: Let me talk a little bit about\n\nrisk. I was\n\ninvolved in the first launching of the space shuttle\nColumbia and then presided over the next 13\nlaunches. We had yesterday the Apollo 13 event, and\nI was on the accident investigation\nboard for that\n10\n\nflight back in 1970. I have, therefore, a little bit of\nacquaintance with the business of risk taking. About\n20 years ago I had a conversation\nwith Werner Von\nBraun about this subject, the subject of the risk of\nsending people into space, and he drew an interesting\nanalogy. He said that what you have in the case of\nspace exploration\nis already something we\'ve had\nexperience with on earth, namely the exploration of\nAntarctica. This was also a very risky enterprise in\nthe early years of this century. He put together a time\nscale on how things happened and he said, "Look, the\nAmundsen\nexpedition to the South Pole was December\n1911--the equivalent of that was Buzz Aldrin\'s first\ntrip to the moon in 1969." He said it took 30 years to\nreally develop the technology to go to Antarctica and\nthe key enabling technology was airplanes. Lincoln\nElsworth and Richard Evelyn Byrd made it possible\nfor people to occupy Antarctica by demonstrating\nthat\nyou could operate airplanes there. He then said,\n"You know, 20 years from now tourists will go to\nAntarctica."\nI want to pick up on that tourism, Buzz.\nThree years before my father died at the age of 97, he\nactually went to Antarctica on a tourist ship. That was\nin 1991, so that\'s 80 years after 1911. Buzz, I would\nsay that we will have tourists on the moon in the year\n2050, 80 years after your first trip to the moon.\n\nBuzz, I would say that we will have tourists\non the moon in the year 2050, 80 years after\nyour first trip to the moon.\n\nDR. ALDRIN: Without\n\na doubt.\n\nDR. MARK: And the risk will be reduced by the\nintroduction\nof new technologies,\nas you say. Start\nwith very high risk operations,\nand you get to the\npoint eventually where tourists go, and I\'m convinced\nthat will happen.\nDR. ALDRIN: I don\'t think they have to go that far to\nhave a real treat. Zero gravity for a period of time,\nlooking down on the Earth--some\nof those pictures\nthat were put in IMAX of approaching Gibraltar and\nseeing the Mediterranean.\nImagine in real life to be\nable to witness that sort of a view, not just within the\ntheater.\nDR. TELLER: I like to do what my mother tells me to\ndo, and even not to do what she tells me not to do,\nwhich is more difficult. I think to go into space is an\nexpensive business and will not become very cheap\nvery quickly. On the other hand, we have an enormous development of electronics,\nof computers, and\ntherefore the jobs that have to be done can be done, in\npractically all cases, near to the Earth by electronics,\n\nVISIONS\n\ncomputers--without\npeople\nand,therefore, ithout\nw\nanyrisk of life.\nWhenyougoto themoonyouhaveenormous\npossibilities\nlike, for instance,\nusethemoonasa refuelingstation.This will becomplicatednough\ne\nsothat\npeople beneeded. hopethatthese\nwill\nI\nvery importantjobs will getdone.Whatarewe spending n\no\nspace? wentybillion dollarsa year...\nT\nDR. MARK:\n\nA little more.\n\nDR. TELLER: . . .and we should spend much\nmore--but\nwe should spend it where it pays off. Hans,\nI fully sympathize with my old teacher and your father\nHermann Mark. I do want to go to Antarctica; I will\nnot go to the moon.\nDR. MARK: Let me add that some of the most important spin-offs in our technology have come out of the\nspace program. And I think it is again very important\nthat we keep up an awareness of the big picture. The\nbig picture says that we need to do a lot for the people\non this planet, whether it\'s commercial aviation,\nwhich almost gets neglected in a lot of the discussions\nor aeronautics generally, or whether it\'s science education or education at large. I think we also want to\nmake sure we\'re not only looking at what can we do\nwith Mars or the moon. Let\'s also keep an eye on\nwhat\'s happening here.\nDR. GUNN: Well, you know, I find it\'s sort of a hard\nsell to say space has been good to you because of the\noffshoot of technology.\nThis is good, science is good,\nthis is interesting.\nI think Joe-Bag-of-Doughnuts\nsays,\n"Who cares?"\nBut Gen. Kelley, if we spent 10% of\nour budget on sending a whole bunch of Joe-Bag-ofDoughnuts into space, so they\'ve got their ride, do\nyou think that the 100% of the budget might be a lot\nbigger?\nGEN. KELLEY: Could be, depending on the experience. Let me take a slightly different track on this\nthing, from a military point of view. We took a look\nat this in a little study we did. Surprisingly,\nof all the\ninteresting things, concepts, ideas that we\'ve identified\nlooking into the far future, there\'s two things: sometimes when you do a study, it\'s important what you\nfind and then what you don\'t. What we did not identify was a requirement\nfor a military man or woman\nin space through the far future. Did not. We\'ve got a\nlot of sensory capability through machines, generally\nmachines, that do it pretty well. So, what\'s the overriding reason to have a military man or woman in\nspace? I don\'t believe it\'s a trivial question. When\nyou go to space, there\'s mortal risk, so too on the\nAmerican highway, but new venture is risk, money.\nAnytime you try to drive risk to zero because you\'re a\nlittle concerned,\nyou drive the bottom line where? To\nthe red. So, how much is it worth, America? And\n\nFOR\n\nTHE\n\nFUTURE\n\nthat\'s what we\'ve got to engage and that\'s why I\'ll\ncome back again to what I stated earlier; education\'s\nimportant. If Joe doesn\'t understand,\nif he can\'t identify with what we\'re doing, he\'s going to have troubl_\nsupporting it. And so the U.S. Space Foundation,\nevery college and university,\nlike Dr. Mark\'s operation down in Texas, what we do for the military profession, Air University,\nwe\'ve got to help the war\nfighter, we\'ve got to help Joe-Bag-of-Doughnuts,\nwe\'ve got to help America understand\nwhy this is an\nimportant risk to take.\nDR. NEUMANN: An interesting sideline is that JoeBag-of-Doughnuts\nin the emerging world, which is so\ntechnologically\ndependent,\nis going to have to have a\nmuch deeper understanding\nof the technology then he\never has before, simply to survive.\nDR. GUNN: Buzz?\nDR. ALDRIN: Well I\'ve been a military person; I\'ve\nbeen associated with the Air Force. I\'ve observed that\noccasionally it changes its mind over a period of\nyears. I remember a Dyna Soar program that had a\nhuman in it, I remember a Blue Gemini, and an\nMOL, I remember well. And in each case there was a\nprogram and then there was no program, and then\nthere was a change, manned space flight engineers,\nlaunches of shuttles from Vandenberg. Let me just\nquestion whether Black Horse is going to be operated\nby a robot. We\'re going to need policemen to monitor\nwhat does happen in space, in security, in customs.\nMaybe we can do all these things with robots and\nlittle cameras, but I think we\'re going to need some\nmilitary people eventually to pave the way, and\nthey\'re going to be involved. I just came from a\nfighter squadron reunion and those guys want to be a\npart of this, with their children.\nDR. GUNN: We want to be a part of it; I want to be a\npart of it. I\'ll go. I want to go, but when should we\nbe using and how should we be using humans in\nspace?\nDR. MARK: Let me answer that, because again, I\'ve\npersonally been in a position to make such trade-offs.\nIf you talk about Dr. Teller\'s question of using the\nmoon as a cosmic gas station, that depends on finding\nhydrogen there, or water if you will. You find that\neither as ice on the surface--and\nby the way, the\nwater comes from bombardment\nby comets, that\'s the\nsource--or\nyou find it as hydrated rocks that one\nmight look for. I think if you\'re really going to thoroughly look for fuel on the moon, you have to send\npeople. It\'s too difficult to do that robotically,\nbecause\nyou just can\'t anticipate what you\'ll find. You could\nmake some preliminary\nexplorations,\nbut in the end\nyou\'re going to have to send people back to the moon\nand drill into the ground and really look.\n11\n\n1 ITH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nLet me switch subjects for a minute. We haven\'t\ntalked about making money on space. Three years\nago, a friend of mine came to me after the end of the\nGulf War and said that after every war somebody\nfigures out ways to make money out of it. "What is it\nin the Gulf War that has happened that should change\nthings around?" he asked. And I kind of blurted out\nthat GPS was, of course, decisive.\nDR. NEUMANN: The chocolate\ndegrees.\n\nWe have created\n\nhundreds\n\nthat survives\n\n140\n\nof jobs in the past\n\nthree years on some fairly simple\napplications\n\nDR. MARK: The place to look is on the south pole,\nand I would submit that the evidence is not very\nstrong yet. One really has to go back to the moon,\none has to go back with better instruments,\nand even=\ntually one has to go back with people.\nDR. TELLER: What is your bet? I\'m going to bet oneto-one that you find ice there. Not a certainty, but it\'s\nnot a thousand-to-one,\nit\'s not a hundred-to-one,\nit is\none-to-one.\n\nof GPS, and we\'re going to make\nDR. MARK: I won\'t\nwe\'ll find it too.\n\nmoney.\n\nDR. MARK: No, not that. But, we organized a company three years ago to use GPS to manage fleets of\nmaintenance vehicles that the telephone company runs,\nthat cable TV companies run, and now we\'re selling it\nto power companies.\nWe\'ve already sold about four or\nfive thousand of the things we make. We have $50\nmillion worth of orders. Now, Joe-Bag-of-Doughnuts\nworks for us. We have created hundreds of jobs in the\npast three years on some fairly simple applications\nof\nGPS, and we\'re going to make money. We\'re going\nto have a company that will be large. We\'ll go public.\nI think that\'s going to happen more and more as space\nsystems become more available. I think Iridium, for\nexample, is another one that is going to become very\nimportant.\n(Iridium is a worldwide\ncellular telephone\nsystem using many small satellites. It is being developed by Motorola.)\nDR. GUNN: Well, I think Joe-Bag-of-Doughnuts\nsees\nthe end, sees the final result when it\'s finally here and\nhe gets his job. But, this has to start with funding. It\nhas to start with some federal funding here, and that\'s\nthe problem. How do we start it?\nDR. MARK: The funding\nDR. GUNN: It\'s the threat.\nDr. Teller?\n\nstill comes\n\nfrom the threat.\n\nNot a stirring\n\nvision.\n\nYes,\n\nDR. TELLER: What shall we establish on the moon? A\nfueling station. Yes, really to do it people will be\nneeded, no question. But, a little point: Clementine\nhas found something peculiar on the moon. Near its\nsouth pole, there is a big region, more than 100 miles\nby 100 miles, a deep old crater. It is almost precisely\nat the south pole and the moon is almost precisely\nperpendicular\nto the ecliptic. The bottom of that crater\nmay not have seen the sun for a billion years. That\n12\n\nmeans that those comets or whatever hit will stay\nthere. Clementine\nwas a cheap project that cost altogether $80 million, a very small fraction of the $20\nbillion we are spending on space. It has already given\nevidence that the place to find ice on the moon is on\nthe south pole.\n\ntake the bet, because\n\nI think\n\nDR. TELLER: Now another point. I agree with you\nalso on the need of a threat, but I claim there is no\nshortage. And I do not mean the threat from North\nAfrica to southern Europe. I agree that\'s important,\nvery important, but there is the threat of being hit by\none of those comets. The last time it happened was in\nSiberia, the Tunzuska meteorite. I was then six\nmonths old--in 1908. It exploded above the ground,\nan explosion of 10 million tons TNT equivalent.\nHad\nit happened in a populated region, it would have been\na big disaster. We have excellent reason to believe\nthat this is a disaster that, with appropriate notification, can be averted. Here is a threat that is less probable than most other threats, but when it happens, it\ncan become enormous.\nSixty-five million years ago\nthe dinosaurs were killed. The whole population of the\nEarth changed. That I think is a very interesting threat\nthat can help to unify the world\'s efforts. Nations\ncould work together and thereby avoid unnecessary\nthreats.\nDR. GUNN: It looks like the NASA budget is going to\nget cut. It looks like it\'s going to stay cut for awhile.\nGiven what we have--what\nresources we have--what\ndo you think we ought to do? Buzz?\nDR. ALDRIN: I think we ought to preserve the objective of human permanence\nin orbit. Whether it\'s the\npresent international\nspace station that brings together\nthe two former conflicting partners, the Russians and\nthe western powers, or whether it\'s something we\nhave to back off from, we should have something up\nthere that we can go up and visit and occupy. Maybe\nin a temporary way, maybe permanently.\nSo, whatever Congress does, I think we have to preserve that\nand a progressive\nmeans of supplying those assets in\norbit.\n\nVISIONS\n\nDR. GUNN: How about you, Dr. Mark?\nDR. MARK: I think first we have to straighten out\nsome management\nproblems in NASA. I like the move\nnow to take the shuttle off the civil service payroll and\nput it into a single contractor and then perhaps even\nbegin to privatize it. You know, we did that back in\n1962 with communication\nsatellites. We set up a\ngovernment-sponsored\ncorporation\nin 1962. The government had 51 percent of the stock, then AT&T,\nRCA, IBM, and, I believe, Western Union. In 1969,\nseven years later, the government\npulled out and we\nhad a commercial\nenterprise. I would suggest that the\nshuttle be organized, and all other launch vehicles, by\nthe way, be organized somewhat the same way and\nthat\'s, I think, one management...\n\nFOR THE FUTURE\n\nWe need to be able to go into space that way,\ndown a runway of any reasonable length, anywhere in\nthe country rather than this way. And I think that if\nwe can move to that, we can do a lot of good things\nfor America, and get America involved. An F-16 is\nvery sophisticated.\nSo is the B-1 and a B-2 airplane,\nand we maintain them with well-trained\nhigh school\ngraduates. And we fly them with well-trained\ncollege\ngraduate history majors. We need to adopt that kind\nof philosophy in our space business and from a military perspective,\nthat\'s different. I think if we can do\nthat, we\'re going to get more of America behind what\nthis country is doing in space.\n\nTo me it\'s not helpful that the only way this\nDR. GUNN: A priority\n\nof forging\n\na commercial\n\nlink...\n\nDR. MARK: Well forging a link, you can\'t make the\nshuttle a profitable enterprise,\nor any other launch\nvehicle, any big launch vehicle, but little ones you\nmight be able to at the moment. But you can move in\nthat direction;\nyou can bring in people who know how\nto commercialize\nthings, and we in the public sector\ndon\'t generally quite know how to do that.\nDR. GUNN: Looking at, from your viewpoint, what\nyou\'ve been studying and the great joy of spending\nother people\'s money, what would you think, General? What do you think NASA ought to do?\nGEN. KELLEY: In our little work down there at Air\nUniversity,\nwe tried to look at a set of alternative\nfutures. One of those was called a space-faring\nworld,\na very high technological,\neconomic activity, a lot of\npeople playing in space, a lot of strong will by all\ncountries involved to be in space. And we strive to\nsay, "How do you make that happen?" Because we\nlearn from many people, if you can create a vision of\na place that people want to be, they\'re going to try to\ndo that.\nHow many of us in this room remember back\nwhen we were little kids growing up, in what I would\nsay were still the early days of air power, what did\nyou do as a kid if you were interested in airplanes?\nYou went down to the local big airport and watched\nthem land and take off. I used to do that from Indiana, going down to Indianapolis.\nYou look around\ntoday and you don\'t see people doing that very much.\nWhere do they go watch things happen? NASA, Cape.\nWe need to change, in my opinion, a little bit about\nour attitude, \'cause air power moved on and we need\nto get the space business moved on. To me it\'s not\nhelpful that the only way this great nation gets to\nspace is from two pieces of concrete in Florida. Or\nmaybe a couple out in California. We need to be able\nto go to space from Garden City, Kansas.\n\ngreat nation gets to space is from two pieces\nof concrete\n\nin Florida.\n\nin California.\n\nOr maybe a couple out\n\nWe need to be able to go to\n\nspace from Garden City, Kansas.\n\nDR. TELLER: I have a little suggestion concerning\nhow to do things. Of course, I agree, the more we can\nbring in private enterprise, the more reasonable\nwe\nare apt to get. But, even from the present point of\nview, more electronics,\nmore computers,\nmore technology all point in one direction. We can do nearEarth jobs, like looking for the weather and many\nother things, without man, without terribly much\nexpense, with small satellites. The emphasis on small\nsatellites, where the launch will cost not much more\nthan a million dollars, where the satellite might be not\nmuch more than 100 pounds, maybe 200 pounds. This\nis the way to be allowed to make mistakes and learn\nby them. If you want to send man, if you make big\nsatellites, then whenever you make a mistake you pay\nfor it dearly.\nNow I want to quote the greatest physicist of all,\nNiels Bohr. He gave a definition of an expert. An\nexpert is a person who, through his own painful experience, has found all the mistakes that one can commit\nin a very narrow field. If you don\'t make mistakes,\nyou don\'t learn. If you only do big things, you can\'t\nmake mistakes.\nI support exploration and continued investigation\nof the small unmanned objects near the Earth. What\nwill we get out of it? All kinds of things. But to my\nmind one point stands out. Today we are terrified of\neverything.\nWe are terrified of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\nWe are terrified of vanishing\nozone. We are introducing\nall kinds of regulations,\nwhich have been estimated to cost us more than $100\nbillion a year. And all this is being done on incomplete information.\nThe small satellites could help us to\nbecome much more reasonable\nand be worried about\n13\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nthe environment\nonly in the very important cases\nwhere you have to be worried and not to be worried\nunnecessarily.\nSo, I am for high technology with small satellites\nand to use it to learn more, particularly\nabout the\nenvironment\nand where we have really to worry about\nit.\nDR. NEUMANN: Many people have commented,\nand\nHenry Petrosky is the one who gets quoted for it most\noften, that we don\'t learn from our successes. We\nonly have an opportunity\nto learn from our mistakes. I\nwould like to make a very strong plea here for the\nvery, very small percentage of the budget that goes\ninto research. If we are, in fact, cutting dramatically\neverywhere,\nsome fraction of one percent is going\ninto research. Research is the tail that wags the dog; it\nis a very, very long cycle--years\nin the pipeline.\nSome of the things that we were doing in the research\nlabs 25 years ago are now emerging into fly-by-wire\naircraft. Some of the redundancy\nmanagement,\nfor\nexample, is extremely critical. Hans and I were talking before, in many systems half of the complexity is\ndue to the redundancy\nmanagement,\ntrying to create\nreliable systems. This greatly increases your risks, and\nyou need to do something about it. So, I would mention some work that\'s going on at NASA Langley\nResearch Center under Ricky Butler, which is the\nformal methods and mathematical\nrepresentation\nof\nsome of these problems, and really serious evaluation\nof whether these systems that you might want to develop would work.\nYou can demonstrate\nthis long\nbefore you ever build the system. I think research of\nthat nature is absolutely critical here.\n\nThe small satellites\n\nand be worried\n\nabout\n\nonly in the very important\n\ncases where you have to be worried\nto be worried\n\nand not\n\nunnecessarily.\n\nDR. GUNN: Now, Buzz, I was noticing you when the\nGeneral was talking about many different launch platforms. It seems that intrigued you.\nDR. ALDRIN: Yes, I think there\'s a very safe launch\nplatform.\nIt\'s a subsonic airplane that uses the technology that enables people to travel millions of miles,\nand the failure rate of airliners is one in 10 million.\nThat\'s the kind of reliability I think that may be involved in launch platforms. We can get up to a region\nwhere we\'re above some of the denser atmosphere,\nand we can drop a rocket that\'s a little bit smaller that\nmay be in its process of accelerating.\nIt can go super14\n\nDR. GUNN: If we were just to do that, how much\nmore over NASA\'s budget, how many times NASA\'s\nbudget would we need to fund something like that,\ntruly?\n\ncould help us to become\n\nmuch more reasonable\nthe environment\n\nsonic with a rocket and then use ram jet air breathing\nto increase the efficiency. We may be able to take off\nsome of the Black Horse airplanes with a very large\nwing aircraft and have it attached to the very large\naircraft when we\'re doing the refueling of the Black\nHorse.\nI think we need to look at all of the things that are\ngoing on and combine them. There\'s a launch platform that\'s being looked at now by a company that\nfloats on the ocean. It can be based somewhere,\ntake\nthe rocket out somewhere,\nand position it where eventually, maybe, whatever that rocket is. The one I\'m\nthinking of happens to be of Russian origin, Russian\nand Ukrainian origin. But down range from wherever\nthat launch sight might be might be a good place to\nrecover some of the first stage parts of it as a building\nblock toward more reusability.\nI want to really make\nit a point. If we\'re going to decrease the cost of\ngetting to orbit, we\'re just going to have to get into\nreusability.\nBut I don\'t think we have to get into reusability in one fell swoop. To have a national launch\npolicy that says one part of our government\nought to\nconcentrate on expendables\nand upgrading that and the\nother part of our government\nought to look at\nreusables and then to watch that part of our government exercise the reusables in the most difficult way,\nthe single stage to orbit (we may do that one day), but\nthat leaves a big gap right in the middle and that\'s the\nreusable booster. Until we face the facts and start\ndeveloping reusable boosters, stage by stage, I think\nwe\'re destined to have way too expensive a launch\nsystem.\n\nDR. ALDRIN: All you\'d need is to assist the private\nindustry with some of the technical problems.\nBuild\nthe next version that tests the fly-back nature of\nbooster rockets. Make that an X- program, instead of\nan X- that wants to do everything.\nWe have an Xprogram by NASA right now, X-34, a small reusable.\nWhy don\'t we have medium reusable?\nDR. MARK: I\'d like to endorse what Buzz has just\nsaid, and add one point about where you get the\nmoney from. I\'ve told you about our little company.\nWe depend entirely on a public investment called\nGPS. We wouldn\'t be there if it weren\'t for that. We\nought to be taxed (I\'m a director of the company, _\ndon\'t tell anybody) for the privilege of using GPS and\nthen that money ought to be spent on the kind of\nthings that Buzz was talking about and the kind of\nthings Edward was talking about, the network of\nsatellites to do environmental\nmonitoring.\nI remember\nin 1982 we started a program called Global Habitability, where we proposed precisely that and it got shot\n\nVISIONS\n\ndown at the time because we were still in the Cold\nWar. We went to a U.N. meeting in Vienna, I remember, and the Soviet delegate got up and said you\nare just going to build spy satellites and we don\'t want\nto have anything to do with it. So we had to shelve it.\nBut the Earth observation\nsystem we\'re proposing\ntoday is very, very similar to that. We\'ve resurrected\nthe old documents and are doing that now.\nDR. GUNN: So, the concept of the companies that\nbenefit, part of their profit is fed back into the program?\nDR. MARK: Of course.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nTELLER:\nThere are two enormous developments.\nOne has been already mentioned--better\ntechnology,\nbetter electronics.\nI don\'t know how much better it is\nthan 20 years ago. I almost would believe it\'s 100\ntimes as good. That is one reason why we can get\nmuch more information\nfrom space.\nThe other reason is what Hans now mentioned; it\nis a very important point. The peace in the world, the\nnon-existence\nof the Soviet Union, makes international\ncooperation\nnow possible.\nThe lesser expense on electronics,\nthe better cooperation between nations, should make it possible to do\nvery, very much more in the next few years. All of\nthe things that have been mentioned, I would endorse,\nexcept possibly what my mother told me not to do.\n\nDR. MARK: But we didn\'t\ntime, Edward.\n\nFOR THE\n\nFUTURE\n\nknow how to do it at the\n\nI\'m sorry.\n\nDR. TELLER: And that is why we should have thought\nahead about what would be of the greatest benefit.\nNow, we know how to do it, but I claim a very recent\ndiscovery.\nI have discovered the most inert substance\nin the world--that\'s\nthe human brain. What we did not\nplan 40 years ago, we cannot think about today. We\ndid not do it 40 years ago. We should urgently think\nof small satellites so that 40 years from now we\nshould do them well.\nDR. GUNN: Buzz, do you think we should go to\nMars? Fast?\n\nDR.\n\nDR. GUNN: Well, in terms of just humans, how far\naway should we go? Do you all agree we should go\nto Mars soon?\nDR. MARK: We\'ve talked about a lot of things.\nLet\nme talk about vision just a little bit. Between 1952 and\n1954 Collier\'s magazine published a series of articles\ntalking about the human race going into space. It was\nput together by a group of people I can\'t remember.\nI\nknow Werner Von Braun was involved, Joe Kaplan\nfrom UCLA was involved, Fred Whipple the astronomer, and there were a number of people. The articles\nwere put together, edited, by the gentleman who later\non wrote the books about World War II, Cornelius\nRyan. But the gist was that there was a series of steps\nthat we would take: go into Earth orbit, build staging\nbases in Earth orbit, go to the moon, build reusable\nspace ships (space taxis they were called), and build\nwinged rockets.\nThey were all in that article 45 years\nago. We would then make a trip to Mars. I think we\nare still executing the plan that was laid out, the vision if you will, that was laid out in those articles 45\nyears ago.\nDR. TELLER: But we did not do one thing 45 years\nago. We did not emphasize the most important of all,\nsmall satellites.\n\nDR. ALDRIN: Methodically,\nand in a very determined\nway. After the experiences\nof Apollo, when we go to\nMars I think we should go to Mars in a sustained,\ngrowing fashion and not go, with humans let\'s say,\nonce, twice, three times and then find that, O.K.,\nwe\'ve done that so let\'s pull back for awhile. That\'s\ntoo big a venture to not do in a gradually increasing\nway. We should have sustainability\nin mind when we\nthink about going to Mars.\nDR. TELLER: That is where we were very wrong. We\ndid not do it on the moon. And you are now telling us\nnot to make the same mistake on Mars.\nDR. ALDRIN: But it was not a mistake\nmoon at the time we went there.\nDR. TELLER: It was a mistake\n\npulling\n\nI think we are still executing\n\ngoing to the\n\nback.\n\nthe plan that\n\nwas laid out, the vision if you will, that was\nlaid out in those articles\n\n[Collier\'s]\n\n45 years ago.\n\nDR. ALDRIN: Well, that\'s a question of affordability.\nI\nthink the cracks that were begun in the Soviet empire,\nby the bitter disappointment\nof our getting to the\nmoon first, began to fracture that threat.\nDR. GIJI_: Well, how much must the U.S., because\nof its space program today, and the funding that is\navailable, it\'s required by the U.S. to take the lead.\nHow much is possible on an international\nbasis?\nDR. NEUMANN: I think a good deal. We started the\nfirst space program jointly with the Soviet Union back\nin 1970 when we started flying American payloads on\nRussian satellites. They were biological payloads. We\nput together, we\'ve flown about a dozen times now\n15\n\nt 1TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nand I remember,\neven with all the ups and downs\nwe\'ve had with relationships\nwith the Soviet Union,\nwe kept that program going. In the case of the space\nstation, when we started that in 1983 and 1984, that\nwas an international\nprogram. In fact, President Reagan went to the London economic summit in June of\n1984 with a model of that space station, and he invited all the allies at the time to contribute,\nwhich they\ndid. I think the step to use Russian equipment on the\nspace station is a very positive one. I don\'t think it\'s\ngoing to save us much money, but I think it\'s a good\nthing to do from the point of view of unifying efforts\nin the world and using space exploration\nas a way to\ndo that. The international\nthings have been expanding\nand expanding properly. There\'s also competition,\nwhich I think is good. I think the competition in\nlaunch vehicles is a good thing; it sharpens everybody. I think there is a growing international\neffort\nhere, and I suspect that we may be second in some of\nthe things that are going to be done in the future.\n\nI think the step to use Russian equipment\nthe space station\n\non\n\nis a very positive one. I\n\ndon\'t think it\'s going to save us much money,\nbut I think it\'s a good thing to do from the\npoint of view of unifying\n\nefforts\n\nand using space exploration\n\nin the world\n\nas a way to do\n\nthat,\n\nDR. ALDRIN: I think the United\n\nStates should encour-\n\nage and support the European development\nof a crew\ntransfer vehicle. We can\'t afford to do that, and I\ndon\'t think we want to upgrade Soyuz, but a crew\ntransfer vehicle that the Europeans may develop to be\nthe next generation ought to also have the capability\nof being extended to be the first human container that\ncan make a direct landing on the moon and return. So\nthere ought to be that kind of growth.\nWe can\'t do it\nall in this country, but I think we should distinctly\nencourage other international\nefforts and not look on\nthem as competitive.\nGEN. KELLEY: A related subject that\'s come up several times. We\'ve all talked about the exquisite developments that are going on in terms of observing this\nplanet, both militarily and environmentally.\nOne of the\nthings that I think perhaps is not advancing at the\nsame pace is, what do you do with all that information? Where does it go? How do we use it usefully?\nIn taking care of the planet and, from a military perspective, how do I as a military man use that? Today\nwe in the military environment\ntalk a lot about C4I,\nC3I, command, control, communications,\nintelligence,\nand computers. Now the first word in that little phase\n16\n\nis command. We have a structure that\'s based on\ngetting the command down, and I\'m not sure that we\nhave a structure that\'s as well suited to getting information, in the form that I need it, that\'s useful to me,\nwhen I need it. I think there\'s much more that we\ncould do as a nation to more productively\nuse the\ninformation\nthat these exquisite objects on orbit can\nprovide us. And we are not making as much use of\nthat as I believe we should be.\nDR. GUNN: We are talking about vision,\nlike to ask each of you... Dr. Teller?\n\nand I would\n\nDR. TELLER: There is one thing we did not talk\nabout. I think we were right not to talk about life on\nMars or elsewhere. Yet, I think also we were wrong.\nProbably, there is nothing of that kind. But we know\nthat there were indications of life on Earth almost four\nbillion years ago, from the very beginning.\nThe traces\nof that were hard to find. If we could find any traces\nof life anywhere in our solar system, that is one of the\nreally big things.\nSecond point. We talked only about the solar\nsystem, but there have been some ideas, some discussions, that go much farther. I want to make one simple statement. We will not do it without the priority,\nwe will not do it with man. We shall do it in an\nunmanned fashion with nuclear energy. We can do it\nand, when we do it we will be able to find detailed\ninformation\nabout distances within our galaxy.\nI think we should not conclude this session without giving thought to the long-range exploration and\nwithout giving thought to the one very, very, sensational thing that did not happen, that may never happen: find life elsewhere.\nDR. GUNN: Now, we\'re talking about visions throughout the entire Space Symposium this week. If each of\nyou gentlemen\nin a wrap-up could give me 30 seconds\non what thought crosses your mind in terms of vision?\nDr. Mark, if you might start.\nDR. MARK: Following up on Edward\'s statement, I\'m\nglad, Edward, that you didn\'t listen to your mother.\nYou really are a visionary.\nDR. TELLER: I am a theorist.\nthink.\n\nI stay at home and\n\nDR. MARK: I think this question of life elsewhere is,\nof course, a supremely\nimportant scientific, as well as\ncultural, question. I think that Edward\'s\nmention of\nthe rocks on the south shore of Lake Superior where\nwe found the fossil evidence of blue-green\nalgae in\nrocks that were three and a half billion years old is\nvery suggestive.\nOne reason for going to Mars, one\ncompelling reason for sending people to Mars, is to\nlook for rocks on Mars that have the same fossil remains of unicellular\nplants and animals. The fact is\n\nVISIONS\n\nthat we know from the Viking results that conditions\non Mars three and a half billion years ago were probably quite similar to those on the Earth. There was\nliquid water; we know that from analyzing the atmosphere. We know that the temperature\nwas roughly the\nsame. So that question is one that I think creates a\nvision, if you will, for the future of what can and\nshould be done.\nDR. GUNN: Thank\n\nTHE\n\nFUTURE\n\nAdministrator\nof NASA and former Secretary of the\nAir Force, Dr. Hans Mark; long-time moderator of\nthe Internet forum on computer-related\nrisks, Dr.\nPeter Neumann.

Gen. Kelley?\nWe have to keep this wonderful\n\nGEN. KELLEY: This is important work that we do,\nand we gather together here today to flip around an\noften used statement.\nThis is rocket science, and we\ncan do it; we are doing it. But I would also be\nreminded of some guidance I got from an old boss a\nlong time ago, that when we work the biggest problems, you keep touch with the smallest parts. Don\'t\nforget about Joe at the Seven-Eleven.\nDR. GUNN: Thank\n\nFOR\n\nyou. Dr. Neumann?\n\nDR. NEUMANN: I\'m reminded of a panel I was on in\n1968. Arthur Clark was the keynote speaker, and he\nwas lamenting how difficult it was getting to write\ngood science fiction. He said, "The future isn\'t what\nit used to be." I think there\'s a wonderful lesson\nthere for us all. We have to keep this wonderful fantasy view of the future, which I think has led us to all\nsorts of wonderful things. But, we also have to temper\nit with the reality and understanding\nthe risks, and\nunderstanding\nthe balance of all the societal needs.\nWithin that framework\nI think that there\'s a great deal\nof future.\nDR. GUNN: Buzz?\nDR. ALDRIN: I\'d like to stress the value of having an\nopen mind and entertaining\nthe other guy\'s idea and\nnot trying to knock it. Competition\nis great; cooperation is great. Somehow we have to learn how to\nmoderate those so that we provide an incentive within\nan organization\nto find a great idea outside and not\nknock it. We all know what NIH means, and that\'s\nperhaps one of the greatest impediments to progress.\n\nof the future,\n\nfantasy\n\nview\n\nwhich I think has led us to all\n\nsorts of wonderful\n\nthings. But, we also have\n\nto temper it with the reality and\nunderstanding\nthe balance\n\nthe risks, and understanding\nof all the societal\n\nneeds.\n\nI want to give a very special thank you to Dick\nMacLeod, President of the U.S. Space Foundation,\nwhose vision it was to invite TechNation here today.\nThank you, Dick. I\'d like to thank our audience and\nour listeners and viewers. I ask all of you, the people\nhere in this room, the generals and the astronauts, the\nscientists and the engineers, the space executives and\nthe space enthusiasts,\nand beyond this room to the\nmillions of listeners and viewers on NPR and PBS\nstations across the United States, to those of you who\ncan hear my voice over 120 countries listening on\nArmed Forces Radio and Television and digitized\naudio and video worldwide\nover the Internet, I want\nto ask each of you to remember that there is no fantastic reality that was not once a vision.

PAYNE: Now that we\'ve gained some insight\ninto the visions of the future, by an outstanding panel,\nwe will discuss how we best position ourselves for\nthat future. It\'s now my pleasure to introduce Theresa\nFoley, the director of Marketing\nSupplements for\nSpaceNews.\nTheresa Foley is a freelance writer specializing in space programs and issues. She\'s been\ndoing that for the past 15 years, which included five\nyears as editor of SpaceNews and three years as space\ntechnology editor of Aviation Week and Space Technology. She\'s written hundreds of excellent articles,\ncovering an entire range of space endeavors from\nlaunchers, communications\nand small satellites to U.S.\nmilitary, NASA, and international\nprograms.\nPlease\nwelcome our moderator for our next session, Positioning for the Future, Ms. Theresa Foley.\nMS. FOLEY: Good morning, and welcome to the panel\non Positioning\nfor the Future. Moira Gunn\'s panel\ngave us some exciting places to go: Mars, the moon,\nspace tourism. The question we are going to look at\nnow is how do we get headed in that direction, or\nwhatever direction Joe-Bag-of-Doughnuts\nwants us to\ngo in. Times have changed. I can remember a few\nyears ago we used to call him Joe-Six-Pack,\nbut apparently that\'s now politically incorrect, so he\'s having doughnuts and sugar instead of beer.\nOur keynote speaker this morning is Steve\nDorfman, senior vice president of Hughes Electronics\nCorp. and president of Hughes Aircraft Company\'s\ntelecommunications\nand space sector. Steve has long\nbeen one of the most influential voices in the space\nbusiness community.\nHe has led Hughes to the enviable position of dominant supplier of satellites in the\nworld today. He is not a man to shy away from controversy and is unquestionably\namong the small group\nof experts on the subject of how to make money in\nspace without relying 100 percent on the U.S. government as your customer. In fact, his point of view on\nthe future of space may be particularly\nappropriate\nto\nkick off this panel, since even if the government\ngot\nout of the space business tomorrow,\nSteve Dorfman\nwould still have a job; a claim that not everybody in\nthis business can make. He\'s been with Hughes since\n18\n\nDr. John Logsdon\nDirector, Space Policy Institute\nGeorge Washington\nUniversity\nGen. Bernard A. Schriever, USAF\nFirst Commander\nU.S. Air Force Systems Command\nThomas F. Rogers\nPresident\nSpace Transportation\n\n0Ret.)\n\nAssociation\n\n1957, ascending the company ladder through a series\nof positions that combine management\nand engineering\non programs that included LandSat, Pioneer Venus,\nand a list of telecommunication\nsatellite projects that\nwould take the entire 20 minutes he\'s allotted to speak\neven to name. So with that I would like to turn the\npodium over to Steve Dorfman.\nMR. DORFMAN: Thank you, Theresa, for that very\nnice and very kind introduction.\nI think that the\nUnited States Space Foundation\ndoes a terrific job of\norganizing this conference, and it\'s clear to me that\nthe key lies with all of these young volunteers\nfrom\nthe local Air Force and space community.\nYesterday,\nas I was out in the lobby, I noted a young lieutenant\nfrom Falcon who was mastering the use of the shredding machine that they have out there. A three star\ngeneral came up to the lieutenant and, noticing that he\nwas working this machine, said, "Son, can you help\nme with this document?"\nThe young lieutenant said\n"yes, sir" and snapped to attention, took the document, got the shredder working, and put the document\ninto the shredder. As it was disappearing\ninto the\nmachine, the general said, \'TII only be needing one\ncopy, son."\nI think the message for the generals and\nfor the space executives, for all of us, is to have an\nunderstanding\nof the new technologies\nthat we\'re\ntalking about, what they can do, and how to master\nthem.\nI\'ve been asked to talk about the future of the\nspace program, and for me that\'s especially appropriate. As Theresa indicated, I graduated the year the\nU.S. space program began officially, after the launch\nof the Russian Sputnik. So, the space program and my\ncareer are both the same age, 38 years old. The excitement of those early years motivated me to pursue a\ncareer in the space program, as I\'m sure it did as well\nfor many of you in this room. So, essentially all of\nmy adult life has been shaped by the space program,\nand I have not been disappointed.\nQuite the contrary.\nIt\'s been a thrill to be a part of it, all of it. Even\ntoday, especially today, I perceive unprecedented\nopportunities,\nespecially in those areas of greatest\npersonal interest to me--namely,\nspace exploration,\n\nPOSITIONING\n\nbothmanned\nandunmanned;\nnational ecurity;and\ns\nnavigation\nandcommercial\napplications space\nof\nand\ncommunications.\nIn fact, to tell youthetruth, I wishmy career\nwerestartingtoday,becausef all the excitingopporo\ntunitiesahead. utjust asthereareunprecedented\nB\nopportunities,\ntherearealsounprecedented\nchallenges.\nOneof these, f course,is thefall-off in government\no\nfundingof the space program, with tighter budgets\nacross the board. In this context, "better, faster,\ncheaper," in the words of Dan Goldin, has become\nessential not only for NASA, not only for DoD, not\nonly for the space program, but for government\nin\ngeneral. I think Vice President Gore\'s concept of\nreinventing\nthe government\nis right on, and it\'s something we all have to do in the space program and in\nindustry.\nSo, the challenge that this new "better, faster,\ncheaper" imperative imposes on companies like\nHughes is considerable.\nIn order to continue to serve\nour commercial\nand government\ncustomers in this new\nenvironment,\nwe have to learn to do more for less. I\nbelieve that\'s feasible; we can do more for less with\nimprovements\nin productivity\nand technology.\nDuring the next few minutes, I would like to offer\na few observations\nabout the future of the space program. In using the term "space program,"\nI include\nnot only NASA and DoD, but also the satellite-based\ncommercial\napplications\nof space, particularly\ncommunications and navigation.\nBut first I would like to talk\nabout space exploration.\nIn my view manned space\nwill continue to be the largest single component of the\nspace program--constituting\napproximately\na quarter\nof the total U.S. space program and half of NASA\'s.\nThe shuttle continues to demonstrate\nits credentials as\na spectacular\nmachine, with six to eight successful\nlaunches per year, and I think that\'s going to continue\non into the next century.\nWho is not overwhelmed\nwith the grandeur and\nthe audacity of the space program when they go into\nthe vertical assembly building to see the shuttle being\nassembled? Or when they watch a shuttle launch from\nFlorida? And I hope that sense of awe continues for\nme well into the future. I happen to be personally\nindebted to the shuttle team and to the astronauts who,\nto date, have rescued four Hughes satellites over the\nyears that were in the wrong orbit and had to be\nplaced in the right orbit. I think Tom Wolfe was right\non when he credited the astronauts with having "the\nright stuff." I\'ve never met a better or braver group,\nand last night I bought Jim Lovell\'s book, which I\'m\nlooking forward to reading.\nDan Goldin has done a brilliant job, in my estimation, of securing a future for the space station by\nmaking it a multinational\nventure. And what better\nway to symbolize the end of the Cold War than with\nsuch strong Russian participation?\nIt seems like only\nyesterday that Jim Beggs was selling the space station\nprogram as a way of competing with the Russians,\n\nFOR\n\nTHE\n\n_UTURE\n\nand now we\'re collaborating\nwith the Russians.\nOf course, this collaboration\nadds fantastic technical and management\nchallenges to the program,\nwhich, in turn, underscore\nanother challenge that we\nface; namely, safety. It reminds us that we should\nnever again mislead our nation to believe that space\ntravel is safe. No matter how much we emphasize\nsafety, there is a possibility that there will be more\naccidents and perhaps more lives lost, and we should\nbe prepared for that possibility.\nAs we consider both our manned and unmanned\nprograms over the next decade, "better, faster, cheaper" is an excellent motto for NASA, which must renew itself as all mature organizations\nmust. Dan\nGoldin\'s announced plan to downsize people rather\nthan programs is excellent, and consistent with the\nrestructuring\noccurring throughout the world. For\nexample, in my company, Hughes, we have reduced\nour work force more than 30 percent since 1988, even\nthough our sales were growing during the same time\nperiod. A major restructuring\nat NASA will be challenging in a civil service environment.\nBut where\nthere\'s a will, there\'s a way. It must be done.\n\nAs we consider\nmanned\n"better,\n\nboth our manned\n\nprograms\n\nand un-\n\nover the next decade,\n\nfaster, cheaper"\n\nis an excellent\n\nmotto\n\nfor NASA, which must renew itself as all\nmature\n\norganizations\n\nmust.\n\nNASA distinguished\nitself as a superior management team already in the \'60s. The Apollo program\nexemplified excellence in the management\nof launch\nprograms.\nNow, NASA has an opportunity to lead the\nway in reinventing government\norganizations\naccording to the model advocated by AI Gore. I think there\'s\na NASA leadership role here that could be very impressive.\nAs NASA reinvents itself, restructuring\nwill also\ninclude diversification.\nAn efficient, less bureaucratic\noperation will free up resources that can be used to\nexpand the number and range of NASA programs.\nI\nbelieve that NASA\'s planetary program will be a\nmajor beneficiary of the agency\'s restructuring,\nand\nthat a better mix of programs can be carried out. This\nincludes large programs,\nlike Galileo, but also small\nprograms,\nas discussed in the previous session about\nsmaller spacecraft. I\'m particularly\nimpressed with the\nDiscovery program and the opportunity\nit presents for\nmore frequent launches. We have to get out of the\nsituation we\'ve gotten ourselves into, which is a planetary launch every five to 10 years, where we put all\nour eggs in one basket and then suffer the bitter disappointment such as we experienced\nwith the Mars Observer failure. The Discovery program offers the\n19\n\n1 ITH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nopportunity of a launch every year, instead of every\ndecade, and I think that\'s a course of action we should\nbe pursuing.\nWhile a restructuring\nwill help NASA achieve\nthese goals of expanding its breadth as well as its\ndepth, technology will also play a clear role. Advances in space technology will enable NASA to perform future space missions at lower costs. A good\nexample can be found in the recent TDRS acquisition.\nThe next generation of TDRS spacecraft--that\'s\nTracking and Data Relay Satellites--will\nuse new\ntechnology and will cost one half of what the first\ngeneration of TDRS satellites cost per satellite. Furthermore the new TDRS will be able to be launched\non an Atlas 2-class vehicle, instead of ShuttleflUS,\nfor\na quarter of the cost. I think that\'s an example of what\ncan be done with the new technology.\nThe TDRS\nacquisition also benefited from changes in the procurement process, and these changes will produce additional cost savings for NASA. For this procurement,\nNASA adopted commercial\npractices by identifying\nrequirements\nand allowing the contractor,\nin this case\nHughes, to determine how best to meet those requirements.\n\nThe ubiquitous\nseeing satellites\n\nreach of our all-learning,\n\nall-\n\nmakes them indispensable\n\nparts of our national\n\nsecurity\n\nprogram.\n\nAs NASA\'s space program matures, it will also\nbenefit from new management\napproaches.\nFor example, partnerships\nbetween academia, industry, and\ngovernment\ncan be very powerful, and the Discovery\nprogram, as an example, encourages this. In our case,\nwe\'re teamed with Richard Goody of Harvard as the\nprincipal investigator\nand JPL on a proposal for a\nmulti-probe\nmission to Venus, which will be a followup to the successful Pioneer Venus mission. We are\ncompeting against other teams for this total science\nmission, and the final determination\nof which mission\ngoes will be based upon peer reviews of the value of\nthe science mission and its cost. Science is maximized, bureaucracy\nis minimized, and I think that\'s a\ngood example of the many profound changes underway at NASA.\nIf manned and unmanned\nexplorations\nand scientific missions are the most exciting components\nof the\nspace program, then space-based national security\nmissions are surely the most underappreciated.\nClassification requirements\nhave prevented the public from\nfully understanding\nhow important the space program\nhas been to national security. Our eyes and ears in\nspace were a major factor in our Cold War victory,\nand they demonstrated\ntheir decisive power on the\nbattlefield in the Gulf War. Our defense satellites\nhelped us win the Iraqi war in ten hours. The unprec20\n\nedented situational awareness these satellites gave our\nmen and women brought them home with minimum\nbloodshed.\nBut the Gulf War also showed us that the world is\nstill a dangerous place, and that threats can come from\nanywhere. The ubiquitous reach of our all-learning,\nall-seeing satellites makes them indispensable\nparts of\nour national security program. Reconnaissance,\ncommunications,\nand dissemination\nof information\nto end\nusers will be of increasing importance.\nAnd here\nagain, technology\nimprovements\nwill make these satellites more cost effective parts of our national security\nprogram. The term "more for less" is equally appropriate here. Many satellites will be downsized from\nshuttle- or Titan 4-class launch vehicles to Atlas- or\nDelta-class launch vehicles, creating substantial reductions in the cost of manufacturing\nand launching those\nsatellites. Again, more for less.\nIn addition to the positive changes brought about\nby technology improvements,\nadditional benefits are\nresulting from changes to the acquisition system. As\nan example, the Navy UHF Follow-on program,\nwhich Hughes is under contract to carry out, used a\ncommercial\nacquisition approach that enabled Hughes\nto base our winning bid on our dual-use HS601 bus.\nIn this way, the Navy was able to purchase 10 satellites at an average fixed price of $170 million per\nsatellite, including the cost of launching those satellites. This was an unprecedented\nprice compared to\nprevious programs,\nand even more remarkable\nconsidering the fact that it had a complicated\nSHF, UHF and\nEHF communications\npayload. The acquisition approach used by NASA for TDRS and by the Navy for\nthe UHF Follow-on program enabled us to maximize\ndual use. The HS601 bus now serves as the key\nelement for 13 government satellites and more than 18\ncommercial\nsatellites. Both our commercial\nand our\ngovernment\ncustomers benefit as a consequence.\nI\nexpect to see more of this in the upcoming SBIR and\nGPS acquisitions.\nI expect DoD to utilize these same\nkinds of acquisition approaches to get more affordable\nprograms.\nAgain, more for less.\nWhat we have achieved and will continue to achieve in our manned and unmanned space programs\nand in our national security space program is truly\nbreathtaking.\nNow, however, I would like to turn to\ntwo other areas in our space program that offer even\ngreater opportunities,\nin terms of creating jobs and\nboosting this nation\'s economy. I believe the two\napplications\nof navigation and communication\nwill\ncontinue to offer us our most significant opportunities\nfor commercial\naccomplishments.\nAs the Air Force prepares to acquire the third\ngeneration of GPS spacecraft, GPS continues to grow\nin its worldwide use. Hans Mark talked about how\nhe, at the University of Texas, is going into business\nusing GPS. I think there\'s going to be a lot more of\nthat, because the cost of GPS chip sets is going down\ndramatically,\nand as that happens the use of GPS\n\nPOSITIONING\n\nreceivers become\nwill\nmoreprevalentn carsand\ni\nportable\nphones, venin backpacker\ne\ngear.Also, the\nGPSsatellites become coreelement worldwill\na\nof\nwideair traffic controlsystems ndwill beusedfor\na\nfuel-efficient ircraftnavigation, pproaches,\na\na\nand,\nultimately,landing.So,I think we\'regoingto find\nthatthird-worldcountries\nusingGPSwill havemore\nmodern\nandmoreefficientair traffic controlsystems\nthanmanymodern\ncountries,ncludingour own.\ni\nSimilarly,newapplicationsreproliferating\na\nfor\ncommercial\ncommunications,\nwhichis thefocusof my\nbusiness. a result,this business achieving\nAs\nis\nunprecedented\ngrowth.Therearealready145geostationary commercial\ncommunicationatellites orbit tos\nin\nday.Like othermanufacturers,\nHughes experiencis\ningrecordbacklogs\naswedid lastyear,this year,and\nnextyear.Wewill belaunching\nanaverage about\nof\nonesatellite month.In fact, wehaveoneschedper\nuledto launchthis afternoon, oI wantall youguys\ns\nto berootingfor us.

Digital communication\nand compression\nis dramatically increasing satellite capacity.\nIn keeping with our goals of providing our customers more for less, we at Hughes, and other companies also, are incorporating\nthese technology improvements into our satellites and systems. As an example,\nwe developed a lightweight xenon ion propulsion\nsystem that was originally sponsored by NASA for\nstation keeping and that replaces a heavier chemical\nversion.\nBy using this, we can save 800 pounds of\npropulsion,\nand that reduces the launch cost for our\ncustomers by $10 million. We\'ll be launching the first\nsatellite using this propulsion system at the end of this\nyear, Galaxy 3-R.\n\nThere are 900 filings for new communication\nsatellites\n\nbefore the International\n\nTelecommunications\n\nUnion. I don\'t think all\n\nof these will go, but many may.\n\nThese technologies,\ncombined with productivity\nimprovements,\nwhich I\'ll mention later, have improved the cost effectiveness\nof Hughes\' communication satellites by a factor of 25 in the last 10 years.\nThat cost-effectiveness\nfactor incorporates\nsuch measures as improved power, lifetime data compression,\nand costs. As a result, the technological\nadvances, the\nmore powerful satellites, and the cost savings I\'ve\nbeen talking about have stimulated new commercial\nsatellite applications.\nCommunications\nis a very elastic\nmarketplace.\nI\'m talking about communications\nin\ngeneral; so, the lower the cost, the more utilization,\nand the increase in utilization ultimately leads to increased sales. In our case, three of the most promising\nnew commercial satellite applications\nare direct-tohome television, mobile telephony, and high-speed\ninteractive voice, data, and video transmission.\nFirst I\'m going to talk about direct-to-home\ntelevision. At the 1977 World Administrative\nRadio Conference 18 years ago, it was assumed that 60dBW, the\nequivalent of a million watts, would be required for\ndirect-to-home\ntransmission\nand it would require onemeter receive dishes. Well, today, with all the technology improvements\nI\'ve talked about, you can do\ndirect-to-home\ntelevision using a half-meter dish and\nonly 50dBW, or 100,000 watts. What this has led to\nin a very practical sense is the very successful\nDirecTV satellite. I hope many of you already have\nyour DirecTV systems, and if you haven\'t, you should\ngo out and buy one! We put DirecTV into service last\nyear with the launch of our first two satellites, DBS-I\nand DBS-2, and we\'re going to launch a third DBS\nsatellite later this year. As many of you know, by\nincorporating\nall the technology advances I\'ve mentioned and by using an uplink center located a half\nhour from this facility, we\'re able to provide more\n21\n\n1 ITH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nthan 150 channels of very high quality digital video.\nAnd after something like six months of being in\nservice, we can\'t keep up with the demand for the\nreceivers, which are being built by RCA and now\nSony.\nWe have 400,000 viewers; we expect that number\nwill be a million and a half by the end of this year\nand over three million next year. This is not happening only in the United States. It\'s happening worldwide, and next year we will begin business in Latin\nAmerica with a very similar system. We\'re calling it\nDirecTV Latin America, and again we\'ll be using\nhigh power satellites to transmit to small dishes. Programs will be in Spanish and Portuguese.\nDirect-tohome TV is a worldwide phenomenon\nthat is growing\nrapidly. I estimate that today there are 25 million\npeople with privately owned dishes who are watching\ntelevision via satellites built by Hughes and others.\nThey\'re watching American programming\nlike ESPN\nand CNN and Home Box Office, as well as local and\nregional programming.\n\nEnsuring access\ncompetitively\nvehicles\n\nto a sufficient\n\nand\n\npriced supply of launch\n\nis critical to our business\n\ninto\n\nspace.\n\nAnother area of commercial\nopportunity\nis satellite\nmobile telephony. Inmarsat has pioneered this and\nserves tens of thousands of maritime and aeronautical\ncustomers. This afternoon, Hughes will launch the\nfirst of a next generation of satellites that will provide\nubiquitous communications\nfor phone users in cars,\nboats, trucks, and trains throughout North America.\nThis satellite, which is owned by American Mobile\nSatellite Corporation,\nwill also enable interactive data\ntransmission\nand will be linked to the GPS system.\nI\'m expecting mobile telephones to be a very\nimportant application in the United States, but I believe the demand will be even greater outside the\nUnited States. Along with many other companies,\nsuch as Motorola, Loral, Qualcomm,\nand TRW,\nHughes is working on the next generation of mobile\nsatellites, which will permit the use of handheld\nphones. Early this year we signed a contract with a\ncompany in India to provide hand-held mobile telephone service--16,000\ncircuits using geostationary\ncommunication\nsatellites. Our satellite will have an\nunfurlable 40-foot antenna, will use on-board processing and spot beams, and all the technologies\nI mentioned earlier. We\'re expecting to sell a lot more of\nthose satellites, and I think that by the end of the\ndecade, ubiquitous,\nglobal handheld telephony and\nother services of that kind will be available.\nNow the final commercial\napplication that I see\nexploding is interactive,\nhigh data rate voice and video\n22\n\nservices, perhaps using Ka band, which was pioneered\nby NASA. Bill Gates and Craig McCaw made headlines with their proposed Teledesic system, a very\nbold vision comprising\n940 satellites. We have proposed a more modest system in geostationary\norbit:\nnine satellites at Ka band. These satellites will enable\nvideoconferencing\nto be done internationally\nat prices\nthat are lower than the cost of an international\ntelephone call today. It will also enable us to make an\ninternational\ntelephone call for less than the cost of\ntoday\'s domestic telephone calls. That\'s less than ten\ncents a minute. We\'re calling this satellite system\nSpaceway, and it\'s an integral part of our vision for\nthe future. Spaceway, the mobile telephony satellites,\nand the DBS video satellites all will be part of the\nglobal information\ninfrastructure\nthat AI Gore and this\nAdministration\nare keen proponents of. By taking this\nleadership, America will design and build the telecommunications networks that will serve the world in the\n21 st century.\nNow, all that I\'ve talked about depends upon\nreliable, affordable access to space--launch\nvehicles-and\nthat\'s the part of the space program I\'m\npersonally most concerned about. While in the last 10\nyears the cost effectiveness of communication\nsatellites\nhas improved by a factor of 25, the cost of getting\ninto space has been flat, when measured in terms of\ndollars per pound. In fact, in some cases it has been\ngoing up. That\'s going to affect our communications\nbusiness. We\'ve reached the point where launch and\ninsurance costs now exceed the cost of the satellite\nitself, when we figure the total cost of putting a satellite into orbit. And there are still entirely too many\nlaunch failures, which also impacts cost because it\ndrives up insurance rates. In addition to these issues\nof cost and reliability, I also am concerned about\nwhether there will be an adequate supply of launch\nvehicles to ensure that my satellite vision can become\nreality. We must consider how we will launch not just\nthe communication\nsatellites, but all satellites, including the government\nspacecraft, and the additional\nspacecraft that are going to be launched because of the\nchanges at DoD and NASA.\nEnsuring access to a sufficient and competitively\npriced supply of launch vehicles is critical to our\nbusiness into space. In the short term, we must have\naccess to foreign launch vehicles. Two-thirds of\nHughes\' satellites--in\nfact, two-thirds of all communication satellites--are\nnow being launched by foreign\nlaunch vehicles, and I think that for the immediate\nfuture continuing to have that option is going to be a\nnecessity. But, in the longer term, I believe we need\nmore cost-effective\nlaunch vehicles that serve the U.S.\ngovernment\nand commercial\nindustry. An upgraded\nand strengthened\nU.S. launch vehicle industry would\nserve two key purposes. First, it would better support\nthe U.S. space program, especially given the larger\nnumber of spacecraft we will need to launch. And\nsecond, it would bolster America\'s\nability to compete\n\nPOSITIONING\n\nin the international\nlaunchvehiclemarketplace. we\nAs\nknow,this problemhasbeen\ntalkedaboutfor a long\ntime,andin timesof austerity been\nit\'s\ntoughto get\nsucha program\nfunded.ButI submitthat,with a $30\nbillion plusperyearspace\nprogram,a rathersmall\ninvestment space\nin\nlaunchcapability\nwouldseem\nto\nbea prudentnvestment.

NASA\'s shriveling budget is going to take the\nagency down a few more notches. White House policy\nis apathetic at best. Public opinion seems to be at a\nlow point, if some of the recent surveys are to be\nbelieved. And the top Pentagon officials accept military space as a necessity, but we no longer have the\nluxury of avid support for new technology,\nsatellites\nand weapons as we did 10 years ago. The industry is\nconsolidating\nat a frightening\npace, and NASA is to\nthe point where lately it has had on more than one\noccasion received only one credible bid for a contract--not\na good situation. Nobody talks about it, but\nradio-isotope-thermal\ngenerators\nlook to be on their\nlast legs; without some kind of nuclear power supply\nfor space, one sure prediction for the future is that we\nwon\'t be going far from home.\n\nThe real renaissance\nwill come through\nmilitary\n\nbusinesses,\n\nfor the space program\nthe commercial\n\nand\n\nand we\'re likely to see\n\nthe upturn in those two sectors first, within\n\nMS.FOLEY: speech\nHis\ngaveme a lot to think about,\nI don\'t knowaboutyouall.

But, before you get too\ndepressed, I wanted to call to mind something that\nhappens to everybody,\nsomething that I call the law of\nrotation. If you think about it you can see the law of\nrotation applies to our individual lives, just as much as\nthe law guides the spinning of the planets and atomic\nparticles. So, if you\'re feeling a bit hopeless, remember that this is a cyclical business and we are really in\na low point. How long will it last? Can you ride it out\nand survive?\nAs a journalist,\nI\'ve been trying to get the answer\nto that question for the last two to three years, and if I\ncould figure out when the space drought will end, my\npublishing clients would pay me a small fortune for\nthe story. Unfortunately,\nmy guess is as good as anybody else\'s, a risk venturing it here. The drought for\nNASA\'s going to be a long one, lasting well into the\nnext century, largely due to the obsession the agency\n23\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nhas with the shuttle and the space station. The real\nrenaissance for the space program will come through\nthe commercial\nand military businesses,\nand we\'re\nlikely to see the upturn in those two sectors first,\nwithin five years or so. Commercial\nis already there,\nthough people usually take it for granted.\nEnough from me. You came here to hear the\npanelists, and we have three more who are going to\nspeak before the coffee break. The format will be\nmuch different from the first panel. The rules are each\nof the next three speakers will have 10 minutes. I\'m\nallowed to use all of the means at the disposal of the\nfourth estate to pressure them to stay on time. That\nincludes interviewing\nthem, not interviewing\nthem,\nwriting a story about them, and not writing a story\nabout them. So I guess I\'ll either be writing a very\nbig one about Hughes tomorrow,\nor not. When the\nfinal panelist is finished, all four members will rejoin\nus up on the stage and we\'ll take questions from the\naudience. So if you have a question, please write it\ndown and someone will collect it.\nOur first panelist is John Logsdon. He\'s director\nof The Center for International\nScience and Technology Policy and the Space Policy Institute of George\nWashington\nUniversity\'s\nElliot School of International\nAffairs. John is a professor of political science and\ninternational\naffairs and has taught at GW since 1970.\nHe serves on many advisory boards and consults with\nseveral organizations.\nMany of you may be familiar\nwith him through the news media, since he\'s probably\nthe panelist who would win the prize for being quoted\nthe most in the press on the subject of space policy;\nthat is, as long as John Pike isn\'t here this year, and I\ndon\'t think he is. With that I turn the audience over to\nJohn Logsdon.\nMR. LOGSDON: When I thought about what I might\nadd to this morning\'s distinguished panel, I rather\nquickly came to the conclusion that I should take its\ntitle, "Positioning for the Future,"\nquite literally.\nThus the question I want to pose and discuss is:\n"What position in space should the United States seek\nas it develops a national space policy for the 21st\ncentury?"\nAs far as I know, the last comprehensive\nstatement of national space policy was issued on November 2, 1989; it itself was largely a reiteration of the\nfinal policy statement of the Reagan administration.\nThat statement declared that "A fundamental\nobjective\nguiding United States space activities has been, and\ncontinues to be, space leadership."\nIs this objective still valid today, given all that has\nchanged in the world and in this country since 19897\nShould the United States still seek the leadership position as its fundamental\nobjective in space? If not, what\nought to replace the quest for leadership as the guiding principle of U.S. space policy?\nTo answer these questions requires a comprehensive assessment of what the United States wants out of\n24\n\nits civilian, national security and commercial\nspace\nprograms. Leadership\nas it has been defined in the\npast was primarily a political objective. We used\nspace accomplishments\nto demonstrate\nto the rest of\nthe world the technological\nand organizational\nsuperiority of the U.S. society--first\nunilaterally\nduring the\nApollo program and then as the managing partner in\nvarious cooperative undertakings.\nWe used our order\nof magnitude larger investments in space to try to\ninfluence the space programs of our Allies, not always\nsuccessfully.\nWe used space as a symbol to ourselves\nabout what was good in American society--our\nsense\nof adventure and pushing back frontiers.\n\nOur government\nand national\n\nspace budget, when civilian\n\nsecurity\n\nactivities\n\nis still an order of magnitude\nEurope\'s.\n\nlarger than\n\nIf we can\'t have a top quality\n\ncomprehensive\nof funding,\n\nare combined,\n\nspace effort for that amount\nwe have a major problem.\n\nPerhaps we should first ask whether we could\ncontinue to seek a leadership position, given the\nshrinking resources we seem willing to allocate to at\nleast the civilian space program. Most of you know\nabout the major reductions\nin NASA\'s five-year budget outlook in the past three budget cycles. I suspect\nalmost everyone in this room would like there to be\nmore money available for new space technology\nand\nnew missions, but we grudgingly might agree that this\nadjustment in budgets and priority reflects political as\nwell as fiscal reality. Can we have a leadership program at the kind of reduced spending levels that seem\nto lie ahead?\nSure we can. Consider what the United States\ngovernment\nspends on space compared to other space\npowers. Our government space budget, when civilian\nand national security activities are combined, is still\nan order of magnitude larger than Europe\'s.\nIf we\ncan\'t have a top quality comprehensive\nspace effort\nfor that amount of funding, we have a major problem.\nWhat we need to do is spend the available funds wisely, not sulk in the corner until space budgets are once\nagain on the upswing.\nI just commented that we have a major problem if\nwe don\'t have the leading space program in the world,\ngiven the amount of money we spend on space. Arguably, that problem exists--or\nat least has existed until\nrecently. I interpret Dan Goldin\'s reforms at NASA\nand the recent and ongoing changes in the organization of national security space efforts as recognition\nthat there have been major problems in the U.S. approach to space--problems\nthat undermine our quest\nfor comprehensive\nleadership.\nWe have a program\nthat is broken at the strategic and institutional\nlevel,\n\nPOSITIONING\n\nwhatever the accomplishments\nof its specific programs. We have not been getting the leadership payoffs (and the other benefits sought) that should be\nexpected, given the investment made.\nOver the past several years, we have been trying\nto remedy this situation from the bottom up--by\n"fixing" specific programs such as station, EOS, or\nearly warning. These case-by-case efforts are certainly\nnecessary, but may not be sufficient. It may well be\ntime to take another top-down look at all U.S. activities in space, so that one can size budgets, develop\ninteractions\namong program elements, make technology investments,\nand promote international\npartnerships from a strategic perspective.\nJust over two years ago, I participated\nin the work\nof a Task Force operating under the auspices of Vice\nPresident Quayle\'s Space Policy Advisory Board,\nchaired by Laurel Wilkening,\nthat did adopt such a\nperspective.\nThe group\'s report, A Post-Cold War\nAssessment of U.S. Space Policy, was issued in December 1992. I believe much of its analysis remains\nvalid, and could form the basis for an inside-the-government national relevance--national\nsecurity, global\nstability, new knowledge, advanced technology,\ncommercial prospects,\ninternational\ncooperation--should\nhave priority as we decide what to do in space and\nhow best to implement our choices.\nIntelligently\npositioning ourselves for the future,\nthen, requires the national policy machinery,\nand also,\nat least, the attentive public, to take a step or two\nback from current program controversies\nand the\nuncertainty\nof institutional\nchange. We need to ask\nourselves where we want to be in space 10 or 20\nyears from now. We need to understand where the\ngovernment\nmust be involved, and how, and where\nthe private sector should take the lead role. We need\nto create or modify institutions and policies to achieve\nour objectives. We need to nurture productive\nand\nstable international\npartnerships\nwhen those are the\npreferred way to pursue those objectives.\nIf we do this, and continue to invest in space at a\ncomparatively\nmuch higher level than other countries,\nwe cannot help but be the leading spacefaring\ncountry.\nBut rather than declare that position as our objective,\nwe can and should earn it. Thank you.\nMS. FOLEY: Thank you, John. You\'ve really set\nyourself up for the first question with the comment\nabout one more space policy.\nOur next speaker is Bernard Schriever, a retired\nAir Force four star general who has a long list of\ncredentials as a space insider. General Schriever retired from the Air Force in 1966 after serving for 33\nyears. Since then he has been involved in military\nspace efforts as a consultant, advisor, and corporate\nboard member to several companies.\nHe is an expert\non the ABM treaty, serving in the Ballistic Missile\nDefense Advisory Board and the Defense Science\nBoard. He has been called on repeatedly to serve on\n\nFOR\n\nTHE\n\nFUTURE\n\ngovernment\nadvisory boards, including both the Payne\nand Stafford commissions\nthat advised previous administrations\non future space goals. General\nSchriever.\nGEN. SCHRIEVER: One thing I\'m not is an expert on\nthe ABM treaty. I wish it would go away. I\'ve been\nasked to--well,\nI don\'t know whether I\'ve been asked\nto--but I\'m going to speak about military space and\nthe future of military space. I\'d like to make a few\ncomments, just very short, on the past. I\'m wearing a\ntie here which has a P-12 on it. Those were the days\nof the Air Corps back in the early \'30s, I doubt very\nmuch if many of you have even seen a P-12. I\'m sure\nthere\'s nobody here who\'s flown one. Now, in the\nearly \'30s, air was considered to be a force multiplier.\nThere were people in the Air Corps who were fighting\nfor the recognition of air power, not just a force multiplier. The Gulf War launched space activities and\nspace assets as force multiplier. But in my opinion\nspace is going to go much further, just like air went\nfrom the early \'30s through World War II. Now we\'re\ntalking about not just air power and air superiority,\nbut we\'re also talking about global reaching global\npower. That certainly is in the future as far as I\'m\nconcerned in connection with space.\nNow as I said, I\'m here (next slide) to talk about\nthe future of military space. To me, future is in the\n15-year range, as the current acquisition process takes\nabout that long. Another imponderable,\nAlfred Mann,\nthe great naval strategist once said, "A peaceful, gainloving nation is not farsighted,\nand farsightedness\nis a\nneed for adequate military preparation."\nI\'m not sure\nwe\'re in that mode today, but I think we\'re pretty\nclose to it. The Air Force has a rich space heritage,\nwhich culminated shortly after the Gulf War, in General McPeak restating the Air Force mission which\nspecified emphasis of space. He enhanced the Air\nForce mission to exploit and control air and space. I\nagree with this completely.\nI would like to start by\nquoting from statements made by some leading Air\nForce commanders\nin the past. First, Hap Arnold after\nWorld War II had great interest in space and asked\nVon Karman to make a study including the feasibility\nof a reconnaissance\nsatellite. He also created the Rand\nCorporation\nand its first mission was to determine the\nfeasibility of a reconnaissance\nsatellite.\nSo the Air Force very early on became interested\nin space and continues to this day. Now LeMay back\nin 1961, he said, "Looking back at the history of air\npower, you\'ll recall the first use of the airplane in war\nwas for reconnaissance.\nFor a time air operations\nwere conducted politely. Opposing pilots waved and\nnodded at each other as they passed. Both sides had\nequal access to the sky. But once reconnaissance\nbegan changing the course of battles, the rules changed.\nIt didn\'t take long before commanders\nrealized that it\nwas necessary to deny opposition,\nto this aid that the\nsky was providing.\nSoon opposing airmen were en25\n\n11 TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\ngaged in battle. First it was air-to-air bombs and small\narms and then came the machine gun. After this came\nbombers and the sky had become another arena for\nactive warfare. I think we will be very naive if we\ndon\'t expect and prepare for the same trend in space."\nNow this was LeMay\'s statement in 1961. Homer, 32\nyears later, after the Gulf War, said, "Using space\nsystems is now fundamental\nto modem warfare, no\none who doesn\'t understand\nit is truly not a warrior.\nHe has not studied his art, and therefore denying the\nenemy access to space is a fundamental\nto modern\nwarfare."\nI completely agree with McPeak, LeMay,\nand Homer with respect to the future of space. Space\nbrings a new infinite arena and another dimension to\nnational security. Control of space could easily become decisive in future conflicts. The space arena will\nnot remain a sanctuary, but is certain to become an\narena of conflict. Therefore,\nit is only prudent to plan\naccordingly.\n\nWe need to rid ourselves\nmilitarization\n\nof space is bad. But rather, by\n\nbeing combat\nfreedom\n\nof the onus that\n\nready, it fills the same role for\n\nof space as the navy does for\nfreedom of the seas.\n\nSelling military space power has become a more\ndifficult thing than selling air power back in the\n1930s. With this in mind, we must broaden our thinking regarding U.S. policy, that is, the emphasis on\nspace for peaceful purposes.\nNo one can quarrel with\nthis objective, but isn\'t it true that our long-held policy of freedom of the seas also clearly embraces the\nseas for peaceful purposes? History indicates that\nthese objectives have on numerous occasions required\nmilitary action. This being one important reason we\nhave the best navy in the world. Furthermore,\nthis has\nnever led to the charge that our navy militarized the\nseas; rather, it served as a major deterrence as is looked upon as mandatory to maintain freedom of the\nseas. We need to rid ourselves of the onus that\nmilitarization\nof space is bad. But rather, by being\ncombat ready, it fills the same role for freedom of\nspace as the navy does for freedom of the seas. In\nshort, the military needs a space force that has more\nfighting capability beyond just a force multiplier.\nIt is clear from the Gulf War that any aggressor\nwould consider our space capability a prime target. As\nwe move into the 21st century this will become an\nincreasingly\nrealistic threat. We will need satellite\nsystems that can function in wartime and have a quick\nresponse capability to reconstitute,\nif necessary. Both\nactive and passive defense of our satellites will be\nrequired. We must also be able to degrade or destroy\nenemy satellites. Military wartime exploitation and\n26\n\ncontrol cannot be achieved with less. Again, we cannot count on space being a sanctuary, which I think\nmany people wishfully do. It is destined to become a\nbattlefield for the new high ground.\nHowever, our satellite system is designed primarily for peacetime operations which we now have been\nin. Launch complexes to ground control, to satellites\nin orbit, down to the war fighter have vulnerable\nwartime nodes. Unfortunately,\nin the U.S. there has\nbeen no consensus on the need for a wartime fighting\ncapability of our space assets. Our greatest challenge\nis to change this mindset to an acceptance that our\nmilitary space force\'s mission is the control of space\nin war and freedom of space in peace. We have the\ntechnology to get this done.\nWe need a sense of urgency and the funding.\nProbably neither will evolve unless a crisis occurs.\nThere is a list of programs that were recommended\nback in 1988 which dealt with the necessity to provide\nprimarily a rapid space force reconstitution\nin the\nevent of war. One program leading to this has already\nbeen mentioned--a\ncompletely reusable space lifter.\nWe need to continue studies such as Space Cast 2020\nand the current SAB study on the anniversary\nof Von\nKarman\'s\nToward New Horizons study back in 1945.\nI see my time is up; there is no point in discussing\nin detail the programs.\nThey\'re all known. They\'re all\nin the books. But space programs need a further sense\nof urgency to get the kind of support that they need to\nprovide a war fighting capability in space. And I say\nthis, in the 21st century there will be the threats that\nwill require them. Thank you.\nMS. FOLEY: Our last panelist is Tom Rogers, President of the Space Transportation Association.\nHe is a\nphysicist, engineer and private investor. Tom began\nhis career doing scientific and technical work on atmospheric phenomena,\nmoving on to focus on communications,\nrockets, and nuclear missiles. His career\nevolved from helping to get satellite and laser research\nefforts started in the Defense Department\nto working\nat HUD and helping to found the Urban Institute. His\nbiography is quite lengthy, and I\'ll summarize by\nsaying that he has been a futurist and explorer for\ndecades, and I\'m sure we\'d rather use the remaining\ntime to hear what he has to say about the future of\nspace than to listen to me read you more details of his\nmany achievements\nand accolades. Tom.\nMR. ROGERS: I\'d prefer to stand here with you this\nmorning wearing the title of chairman of The Sophron\nFoundation.\nI really enjoy my job at the Space Transportation Association,\nbut after what I have to say\ntoday, I\'d just as soon you addressed your letters to\nmy Foundation than to the Association.\nThe title of my talk is the Future Federal Civil\nSpace Program, Page Zero, Page One and Page Two\nIssues.\nDan Goldin is reported in the current issue of the\n\nPOSITIONING\n\nAir and Space Museum magazine as follows.\nHe\nmakes a point to ask as many people as he can what\nthey want from a space program. Not surprisingly,\nthe\nanswer is only sometimes a space station. So he talks\nof pushing outward to the next destination.\nHe says\nonly three missions are feasible: a return to the moon,\na research station on an asteroid, or a trip to Mars.\nWe should work on the space station so one of these\nthree things can happen. In my view, unfortunately,\nthese are what I would describe as "page two" aspirations. They assume that a decade hence there will be a\nsufficiently large national capacity and will to see\nthem pursued. They are "page two."\nWhat is the zero page issue? Well, the age of\nmiracles has not yet ceased. Let me read to you from\npage seven of the NASA Strategic Plan out in February of this year. "Recent public opinion polls continue\nto show support for U.S. endeavors in space. However, in polls which prioritize national programs,\nspace often does not fair as well as it has in recent\nyears. Continued public support will depend on our\nability to satisfy the nation\'s needs."\nLet me repeat that. "Continued public support will\ndepend on our ability to satisfy the nation\'s needs."\nThat is the zero order issue. That is what should have\nbeen on page one in the NASA Strategic Plan. And\neverything else in it should have flowed from it. And\nwhat Dan is talking about should flow from it. They\ndon\'t.\nI am afraid that if the trend in the civil space area\nis downward,\nI don\'t have to add anything to what\nJohn has said and Theresa has said this morning. I just\nwould point out to you that if, adjusting for inflation,\nthe NASA budget goes down at between 5 and 10\npercent per year, a decade from now at 5 percent\nthey\'d have eight billion per year; 10 years, they\'d\nhave five billion per year. The space station and shuttle cost about five billion. Even I can do that arithmetic.\nWell, what is the first of the page one issues? The\nadministration,\nthank God, is attacking one of its two\nfundamental problems. I have been spending the last\nthree years of my life doing what I can to help drive\ndown the unit cost of basic space transportation.\nMake\nit more safe, make it more reliable; drive down the\ncost per pound and per passenger. Without that, ladies\nand gentlemen, we are dead. And not by a factor of\ntwo or a factor of three. By orders of magnitude. The\nwater is in there; it must, and it can, be squeezed out.\nIf it isn\'t, we\'re dead.\nAnd by the way, we\'ll hear from Jack Mansfield\nlater on here. He and others, especially Dan Goldin,\ndeserve one hell of a lot credit for that. And Jack and\nthe others, they\'re off and running. So far so good.\nNow what is the second issue? Cheaper, better,\nfaster what? Cheaper, better, faster what? Let me\ntranslate the statement in the space strategic plan of\nNASA: whenever the value of public spending upon\ncivil space is compared to spending upon improving\n\nFOR THE FUTURE\n\nthe criminal justice system, to improving education, to\nimproving the delivery of health services, you name\nit, space comes last. Sometimes,\nit\'s not even on the\nchart. By and large, the administration\'s\ncivil space\naspirations today would do nothing to increase the\nprogram\'s\nsharply diminished general public constituent support.\n\nBy and large, the administration\'s\naspirations\nincrease\n\nthe program\'s\n\ngeneral\n\ncivil space\n\ntoday would do nothing\nsharply\n\npublic constituent\n\nto\n\ndiminished\nsupport,\n\nThat\'s the remaining zero order issue today. We\nhave two of them. One is being worked on very hard;\nthe other is ignored. At least we\'re not suffering from\ndon\'t-know-squared\nanymore. We are saying we do\nknow that we are not doing what the American public\nwould like to see done and to support.\nWell, contrast for instance what Dan had to say\nabout the space station and what Bob Walker had to\nsay to the Space Transportation\nAssociation\na few\nmonths ago--his view of the space station. His view is\nthat the space station should be a publicly funded\ncenterpiece of a private sector space business park\nsupported by privately created and operated low-cost\nspace transportation\nsystems. He\'s not talking about\ngoing to the planets.\nFor now I will give you what I believe should be\nthe goal--the\nmajor goal--of our Federal, civil and\npower programs.\nI don\'t care what else we do, providing this goal is addressed, hard: we must see low\nearth orbit opened up to the general public and free\nenterprise. I don\'t care what else we do. That we\nmust do. And we must do it in a business-like\nfashion.\nWe\'ve got to get on with getting our people up there\nas tourists and as business people.\nOne other comment. Whatever else one can say\nabout space today, you certainly must say it has turned out to be quite dull. Can any of you really stand up\nand say what\'s going on up there in the shuttle? Who\nare the individuals up there?\nSo let\'s get some fun into it. Let\'s get some excitement. Let\'s get some competition.\nLet\'s get some\nsports going on in space. I have my own judgment as\nto which sports I would like to see go on. I\'d like to\nsee men and women "jumping"\ndown from orbit. The\nfirst one that lands on the ground, alive, gets into the\nGuinness Book of Records. And the second one is:\nwho gets closest to the X on the ground in downtown\nWaverly, Kansas, establishes the next record. And so\non and so on. Let\'s get some excitement. Let\'s get\nsome verve. Let\'s get some competition.\nLet\'s start it\nwith the young men and women of our Air Force\nAcademy and our Naval Academy. Later, let\'s challenge the Russians. That will have people watching\n27\n\nl 1TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nwhat\'s going on in space!\nAnother thing that should be going on in orbit, a\nmuch more sober one, is relevant to Medicare and\nMedicaid and the great cost of those programs and\nwhat they\'re doing to discretionary\nspending and what\nthey\'re doing to the Federal deficit.\n\nWe must start in the space area to generate\nwealth,\n\nnot just spend it.\n\nWe know that, in the absence of the local force of\ngravity in low Earth orbit, you can study the aging\nprocess. And I believe that we have Nobel Prizes in\nthe offing in such life sciences study in low Earth\norbit. (You know, there hasn\'t been a Nobel Prize, to\nmy knowledge, awarded in the space area. Fifty\nyears, a half-trillion\ndollars, and not a single Nobel\nPrize.) I would suggest focusing on aging related life\nsciences, to learn about what happens to people as\nthey get old. We see what happens to the astronauts in\norbit. (They recover quickly upon return to the surface.) We can imagine research for results being obtained up there much faster--by\norders of magnitude.\nNow, just so my point isn\'t missed, I want to say\none thing just a little bit differently.\nWe must get our\ngeneral public into low Earth orbit. In polls in the\n1980s, 80 million adults of the United States said they\nwanted to take a trip to space. Eighty million! What a\npotential constituency!\nAdministration\nafter administration that has led the greatest democracy\nin the\nworld has taken the position that we will not let our\ngeneral public go to space. That is outrageous!\nIt is\nalso pretty damned dumb.\nSo, in signing off, I would say that what we must\nbe doing over the next few years is focusing on the\ngeneral public getting to space--free\nenterprise getting\nto space. We must start in the space area to generate\nwealth, not just spend it. We must think big about\nspace. Large numbers of small things. Get the unit\ncost down. And we must develop large--and\nI take\nmy hat off to Steve Dorfman--large\nadditional private\nsector business markets.\nThank you very much for having me out here.\nQ&A\nMS. FOLEY: A comment was made to me was that\nNASA has a constituency\nof one, and that is the President, and what the President wants the space program\nto do is basically what gets done. There have only\nbeen two Presidents in the history of the space program who have cared a hoot about space and those\nwould be Reagan and Kennedy. So I wanted to ask\nanyone on the panel who would like to comment on\nthat, whether that\'s a valid viewpoint and, if so, does\nthat mean we all have to begin obsessing about the\n28\n\npresidential\nelection, and should we all be hoping that\nClinton gets washed away because he hasn\'t done\nanything for us except cut the budget?\nMR. ROGERS: I think it\'s a perfectly\ntactical thing to say. And a perfectly\nsay strategically.\n\nreasonable,\ndumb thing to\n\nGENERAL SCHRIEVER: Really?\nMR. ROGERS: Remember: of the people, by the people, for the people. The President is in the job as long\nas we allow him to have it. NASA\'s main customer is\nthe general public. And when it appreciates that, it\'s\n90 percent of the way there. The President will do\nwhat he believes the public wants to have done; that\'s\nhis job.\n\nRemember:\n\nof the people,\n\nthe people.\n\nThe President\n\nby the people, for\nis in the job as\n\nlong as we allow him to have it. NASA\'s\ncustomer\n\nmain\n\nis the general public. And when it\n\nappreciates\n\nthat, it\'s 90 percent\n\nthere. The President\n\nof the way\n\nwill do what he believes\n\nthe public wants to have done; that\'s his job.\n\nMS. FOLEY: John,\n\nwould you like to add to that?\n\nDR. LOGSBON: I think it goes back to the point I was\ntrying to make. As long as the program is driven by\nconsiderations\nof politically defined leadership,\nthen\nPresidential\nengagement\nis crucially important.\nBut if\nthe era is behind us, in which such leadership should\nbe the driver of the program, then I think it\'s both\nPresident and the Congress as reflecting the public\nwill that ought to be defining the future in space.\nMs. FOLEY: Anybody want to say anything about the\nelections that are, what, now two years off?.\nDR. LOGSDON: They\'re\n\ngoing to happen.\n\nMR. DORFMAN: I\'d like to say a few things about\nthat. First of all, I think the public is very supportive\nof the space program and the NASA space program,\nwhose budget has increased during periods when most\nother agencies have seen their budgets go down. Second, I believe $14 billion is one hell of a lot of\nmoney, and I think you can do a lot with those $14\nbillion. And so I think that\'s the challenge that NASA\nhas, and I think that NASA management\nis stepping\nup to that challenge and trying to be more effective.\nThat was the point of my presentation.\nI think it\'s\ndo-able. I think you can have a very strong explora-\n\nPOSITIONING\n\ntion program, which is good science. I think you can\nhave a strong Earth observation program. And you\ncan have a man-in-space\nprogram. I think the issue\nwith the man in space program is that it\'s not a necessity; it\'s a luxury. I know that people might quibble\nwith that, but I think, in fact, that\'s the perception\nthat most taxpayers have. And the difficulty we all are\nchallenged with is the decision of whether or not to\nproceed with it, because it\'s perceived as a luxury by\nthe taxpayers. Fortunately\nfor the space station, it was\ntested several times and it\'s come through.\nThe challenge we have now is to make it an international program. That means it will have to survive\nscrutiny in every single country, and each has the\nsame exact fiscal environment\nwe have. So it\'s going\nto be a challenge to keep the space station going. But\nit\'s a management\nchallenge, which, I think, if we\nfocus on it, we could be very successful in overcoming.\nSo I think $14 billion a year is good enough for a\nspace program, and that we have the support of the\npeople. It\'s now just a question of us coming through\nfor them.\n\nI think the issue with the man in space\nprogram\n\nis that it\'s not a necessity;\n\nit\'s a\n\nluxury.\n\nMR. ROGERS: I don\'t know whether I agree or disagree with Steve on one thing, but we may have a\nsemantic problem here. Certainly the American people\nare interested in space. They love it. But we forget\nthe conical male story. You know, the story of two\nmen who went through college together. They corresponded, they didn\'t see each other. They met suddenly 10 years later. They were talking. One asked\n"How\'s your wife?" The other replied, "Hmm?" The\nfirst repeated, "Well, how\'s your wife?" The other\nresponded,\n"Well, I don\'t understand."\nDumfounded,\nthe first one asked,"You\ndon\'t understand?\nWhat?\nHow\'s your wife?" The second responded,\n"Compared to what?"\nl\'m talking about constituencies,\nnot general interest. I\'m talking about people who will go to the wall\nfor your program and fight the other people who want\nto get the money that you\'ve got and the authority that\nyou\'ve got and the regulations that you\'ve got. So, we\nmay have semantics here, but I\'m talking about constituencies,\nnot general interest.\nThe second thing about people going to space. We\ndon\'t run the world the way we did. The Japanese are\ngiving this matter a great deal of thought, a great deal\nof thought. They\'re laying their plans, they\'re conducting market surveys, they\'ve got the first conceptual design of the first tourist-carrying\nspaceship. So\n\nFOR\n\nTHE\n\nFUTURE\n\nwhen I think of a manned space program, I think of\nthe general public going up there, not technicians like\nmyself.\nFOLEY:\nI want to move on to some of the questions from the audience, but Tom, I also wanted to\ncomment that I think you\'ve hit on one of the main\nproblems that\'s bogging the space program down that\npeople don\'t usually acknowledge.\nAnd that is the\nfighting among people for money and power. That\noften takes place of a vision or an end goal that is a\nhigher noble purpose. Last night, watching the Apollo\n13 video, it was wonderful to see the motivation that\nwas there, and I don\'t know that we have that similar\ndrive behind a lot of the things that are done in Washington today.\nWe could go on on that subject for a long time.\nI\'ve got about 30 questions and I\'m sorry we\'ll only\nbe able to do a couple of them. For Steve Dorfman,\nhow long do you think it will take NASA to transform\nitself into an efficient management\norganization?\nIBM\nsaid they were going to take seven years and maybe\nor maybe not they\'re there now. What about NASA?\nWill it be faster or longer?\nMS.\n\nMR. DORFMAN: I think there\'s no way of saying\nwhen they will achieve the goal of becoming an efficient organization.\nI think, like all organizations,\nthey\nhave to be constantly improving, and I think they are\nimproving. They\'ve set an objective recently to downsize by 10 to 15 percent over the next few years. I\nthink it\'s just a continuing process and I think they are\nnow focused on that, like all institutions.\nI\'m hopeful\nthey\'re going to succeed.\nMS. FOLEY: And a question for Dr. Logsdon, and I\nwanted to ask if General Schriever would add to\nJohn\'s answer on the military side. The question is,\nhow do you compare President Bush\'s space policy\nwith President Clinton\'s National Space Transportation Policy? Does the new policy provide a vision for\nthe future in space? And General Schriever, the question wasn\'t about military space, but what about Clinton? There\'s really been a vacuum on military space\npolicy, I think, so perhaps you could both comment\non that.\nDR. LOGSDON: The Clinton Administration\npolicy\nstatement on space transportation\nof last August is a\nvery good, forward-looking\npolicy statement. It gets\nthe roles right. It says that the pressing need to be in\nspace is national security and that DoD will have the\nlead in making our current ELV fleet as good as it can\nbe and have the responsibility\nfor upgrading it, and it\ngives NASA the technological\nchallenge that NASA is\nsupposed to be able to accomplish--to\ndo leapfrog\ntechnology.\nTo compare that to the Bush transportation\nstatement is not realistic. We\'ve been debating national\n29\n\n1 ITH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nlaunch policy for 12 years, and I think the Clinton\nstatement is a good one--if we can execute it.\nMS. FOLEY: General\n\nSchriever?\n\nGENERAL SCrIRIEVER: Well, I don\'t know specifically about the transportation\npolicies that have been\nstated, but I know from the standpoint of national\nsecurity. I mentioned that one of the most vulnerable\nthings we have in being today is the spacelift capability of the national security satellites. We have two\nlocations, Vandenberg\nand the Cape. They are highly\nvulnerable. They\'re not threatened now because we\ndon\'t have any immediate active threats. But we\'re\ngoing to have to go to smaller satellites, smaller\nspacelift capability, and mobile capability. Small satellites, mobile capability for launch.\nWe use the same technology,\nfor example, for\ncommercial aviation as we do for military air. But the\nequipment is quite different, and I think space is going\nto diverge to some extent that which is necessary for\nmilitary or national security needs as compared to\nwhat is available or necessary for civilian applications.\nMs. FOLEY: I have several questions that are not\naddressed to Steve Dorfman, but he\'s obviously the\nperson to answer them regarding Spaceway and direct\nbroadcasting.\nI don\'t want this session to get technical, but they tend to ask a question about propagation\ndelay of the signal and whether there will be some\nproblem with video and voice not getting instantaneously transmitted.\nAnd then another question about\nwhether direct broadcasting\nwill ever be as interactive\nand expansive as proposed fiber optic cables. So,\nperhaps Steve, you could just talk for a minute about\nhow Spaceway and the futuristic services that new\nsatellites are going to provide are going to operate and\nwhether there are technical flaws that have to be overcome.\nMR. OORFMAN: Well, in the direct broadcast to the\nhome, the systems we have now are interactive.\nAnd\nthe way they interact is we have high band with video\ncoming down in a broadcast sense and a telephone line\nfeedback. I think that\'s going to serve some 97 percent of the needs for interactivity\nin the future,\nwhether the medium is cable, fiber, or satellite. And\nthat is because most people only need very low data\nrate out and high data rate in.\nIn the case of the time delay, it\'s not a technical\nissue. It\'s really a consumer issue. And that is because\ngeostationary\nsatellites, when used for two-way communications,\ndo have a slight time delay, which some\nconsumers will accept and others won\'t. The delay\nrelates to the velocity of light and the fact that it takes\na quarter second for the communications\nto go roundtrip. In telephone conversations\nthat\'s an impediment\nfor some people. But it\'s one that people will live\nwith when there\'s no good alternative.\nAround the\n30\n\nworld, as we get more and more fiber optic and landline capability, people will gravitate to the landlines\nfor telephone conversations\nas opposed to satellites.\nThat\'s going to happen as long as the service is there\nand it\'s economical.\nWith mobile communications,\nit has now for the\nfirst time become technically and economically\nfeasible to communicate\nvoice via satellites in low Earth\norbit, because you don\'t have to have tracking dishes.\nSo for now, for the first time, using the hand-held\nmobile systems I talked about earlier, we have\nchoices. We can go at low Earth orbit, about 1,000\nkilometers;\nat mid-Earth orbit, about 10,000 kilometers; or at geostationary\norbit. Each system has its\nown attributes and economics,\nand we\'re now engaging in a new, and I think very fascinating,\ncommercial\nendeavor in which consumers will be able to choose\nwhich of the three types of systems best suits their\nneeds. Iridium and Globalstar will be in low Earth\norbit, INMARSAT-P\nwill be in medium Earth orbit,\nand the geostationary\nsatellites will continue as they\nhave before. I believe all can co-exist in the marketplace.\n\nWith mobile communications,\nthe first time become\neconomically\nvia satellites\n\nfeasible\n\nit has now for\n\ntechnically\n\nand\n\nto communicate\n\nin low Earth orbit, because\n\ndon\'t have to have tracking\n\nvoice\nyou\n\ndishes.\n\nI think that by the end of this decade we\'re going\nto have all three types of systems, and consumers will\nhave new technologies\nto enjoy and new choices to\nmake. Hughes\' bet is on medium Earth orbit satellites\nand geostationary\nsatellites for mobile telephony applications.\nMS. FOLEY: And we have time for one last question.\nI\'m going to read the question from the audience,\nthen change it a little bit I think. I\'d like to direct it to\nTom Rogers and General Schriever. If anyone else\nwants to comment too, please do.\nEveryone agrees that the U.S. needs a new medium lift space launcher. ARPA has a proven method\nof developing low-cost commercially\ncompetitive\nsmall launchers, Pegasus and Taurus. The questioner\ndidn\'t add this, but ARPA\'s out of the space development business now, so they\'re really not a player.\nWhy not follow that model instead of having the Air\nForce pursue EELV and NASA the reusable launch\nvehicle?\nMy twist on the question is EELV and the\nreusable launch vehicle: a) Is it really going to be a\nlaunch vehicle and b) is it going to get you what several of the panelists have said is the number one priority in getting the space program jump-started?\n\nPOSITIONING\n\nGENERAL SCHRIEVER: First of all, I think we have\ndone a lousy job in the launch vehicle area. We\'ve\nreally upgraded the ICBM program, the Atlas, the\nThor, and the Titan. We need to think bigger. We\nneed to have a completely reusable system that, from\na technical standpoint,\nshould be given optimum support. From a military standpoint, we need mobility in\nour systems. And we need to reduce the vulnerability\nof our ability to launch satellites in a wartime situation. I didn\'t get a chance to get into that in any more\ndetail, but I think by civilian requirements\nthe EELV\nmay be effective.\nIt might reduce costs by a factor of\ntwo or maybe three, but I doubt it. I think we have to\nuse new technology,\nnew ways of thinking. We can\'t\nhave a satellite standing on the pad like a research\nactivity and taking three to four months to launch.\nWe\'ve got to change our thinking with respect to the\nwhole business of launching.\nMS. FOLEY: OK, that\'s\nTom?\n\nthe warfighter\'s\n\nopinion.\n\nMR. ROGERS: I\'d say two things. Jack Gibbons\'\nNational Space Transportation\nPolicy paper. I agree\nwith John. It\'s a good piece of paper. It\'s probably\nthe best one in this area that I\'ve ever seen. I think\nthey probably went about as far as they could,\nTheresa. You know, life is complicated\nin D.C. and I\nthink they probably advanced the ball as far as they\ncould.\n\nFOR\n\nTHE\n\nFUTURE\n\nopportunity to get a good, strong U.S. expendable\nlaunch vehicle industry going again--one\nthat we\ncould claim, with integrity, positions us in a leadership role in launching satellites.\nMR. ROGERS: As Steve is able to articulate today, the\nmarket possibilities\nin the information\nareas are enormous. The whole field is yeasty. But in the non-information areas, we\'ve got to learn how to generate\nwholly new markets. And that should be going on in\nparallel with the technology development\nand the\nthinkings about operations.\nMS. FOLEY: Thank you, Tom. I want to thank the\npanelists for them, they\'ve done a wonderful job.\nThank you for being so attentive. I think Dave Payne\nmay have an administrative\nannouncement\nor two to\nmake and the coffee break will start in a minute.\nMR. PAYNE: Thank you, Theresa, and also to your\ndistinguished\nspeakers for providing us with such an\ninformative session. At this time we will be taking a\nfifteen minute coffee break. We will reconvene at five\nminutes to twelve, or twelve o\'clock it looks like\nnow. Thank you very much. This coffee break is\nsponsored by Spaceport Systems International.\nThank\nyou.\n\nOver the next five or 10 years it\'s going to be\nELVs and the shuttle, and if the military can squeeze\na lot more onto the ELVs quickly and sensibly, I think\nthat will help them. It will help the commercial\nside,\nshort term. But I\'m with Ben. We\'ve got to get those\norders of magnitude and this means the reusable vehicle. We should be going like hell at it.\nMs. FOLEY: Steve, are the EELV and the reusable\nlaunch vehicle going to solve your launch vehicle\ndilemma?\nMR. DORFMAN: I\'m fascinated with the potential\nopportunities\nthe RLV offers, and I think NASA\'s\nnow proceeding to invest in the technology.\nI think\nthat\'s good. I believe that we do need to do a little bit\nmore investigation\nabout how it will ultimately be\nfunded. I think it\'s optimistic to think the commercial\nsector will move in to fund a multibillion dollar investment, so I think we need to sharpen our thinking\nregarding funding.\nI emphasized\nin my talk that we need a new generation launch vehicle that will benefit both the government and commercial\nprograms. To think that a\nnew launch vehicle would be funded exclusively on a\ncommercial\nbasis, when over half the launches are still\ngovernment launches, is, in my opinion, idealistic and\nimpractical.\nBut I believe that by properly combining\ngovernment\nand commercial\ninterests, we have a real\n31\n\n] 1 TH NATIONAL\n\nRemote\n\nSPACE\n\nSensing:\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nThe Emerging\n\nEra\n\nMaster\nModerator."\n\nDavid L.

We\'re fortunate to have with us\ntoday Professor Joanne Gabrynowicz\nwho will be\nchairing the session. She is a professor and an attorney. She\'s a professor at the University of Space\nStudies at the University\nof North Dakota. Professor\nGabrynowicz\nteaches classes in space treaties and\nlegislation, space policy and international\nimplications,\nand remote sensing law and policy. She has a number\nof published papers on these subjects. As a sidebar,\nthe University of North Dakota offers the world\'s\nonly Master of Science and Space Studies degree and\nhas produced approximately\n150 civilian and Air\nForce graduates.\nProfessor Gabrynowicz\nis a member of the International Institute of Space Law and the Congressional\nOffice of Technology\nAssessments\nEarth Observation\nAdvisory Panel. She is currently a member of the\nNational Research Advisory Group on Transporter\nData Policy.\nPlease join me in welcoming the moderator for\nour remote sensing session, Professor Joanne\nGabrynowicz.\nPROFESSOR\n\nDr. Murray Felsher\nPresident, Associated Technical Consultants\nDirector, North American Remote Sensing\nIndustries Association\n\nwould it see a white vehicle.\nThe second story has to do with teaching my\ncurrent Air Force classes, which have 33 officers in\nthem, many of whom are missilears and bomber pilots. I was reporting to them I had just come back\nfrom the Goddard Space Symposium\nwhere I heard\nGeneral Doolah tell us all about Talent Keyhole and\nthe fact that we were now allowed to look at these\nimages in a nonclassified\nenvironment.\nThe sound that\nI heard were 33 jaws dropping simultaneously.\nI\nwrote Talent Keyhole on the board and one of my\nofficers said, "You\'re going to erase that, right?" And\nI said, "No, I don\'t have to."\nThese stories are important,\nnot only because they\nreally happened, but also because they demonstrate\nthe\nchanging culture of the remote sensing environment.\nThe first story demonstrates\nthat you can have a highly technological\ncommunity like the police department, which is very used to high-tech possibilities\nfor\ncriminal investigation and still does not have a clue\nabout what a satellite is or what it does. The questions\nI was asked demonstrated\nthat if I asked this fellow to\ndraw a satellite for me, he probably would have\ndrawn a little grapefruit size ball with sticks coming\nout of it. The second story demonstrates\nthat the dynamics of policy, law, and technologies\nare changing\nso much that they really would be hard to protect, and\nI wouldn\'t try to guess that.\nBut at this point, I think in the future of remote\nsensing, three things do seem to be certain. First,\nthere is a growing diversity of opinion about remote\nsensing. Gone are the days when we can expect lockstock opinion of what it does, who should have it, and\nwhere it should be originated.\nI think today\'s panel\nwill reflect that. We have representatives\nfrom Europe, someone who knows about the developing world\nand industry.\n\nREMOTE\n\nThe second thing I think we can count on is that\nremote sensing is inviting U.S. to seriously consider\nthe proper relationship\nand most efficient and most\neconomic relationship\nbetween the public and the\nprivate sectors. In Europe, there is a viewpoint about\nthe relationship\nbetween the public and private sectors\nthat we engage in here in the United States, and it is\nquickly becoming--if\nnot already has become--a\nmajor policy question at the heart of global activities.\nIn the United States we have a situation where the\ncurrent system, the LandSat system which was originally a public sector system, is aging, is on the verge\nof not being able to return any images in the near\nterm, and we don\'t yet have a private system flying as\nhopeful and as promising as they do seem to be. So\nthe United States has a particular interest in dealing\nwith this relationship\nas we speak. In Russia, who\nknows what\'s going on? It\'s another major remote\nsensing agency, but the entire turmoil of going over to\na market-driven\neconomy certainly is going to affect\nremote sensing as it does everywhere else.\nThe third thing that will definitely be a certainty\nin the remote sensing future is what I call dual-use\ndata. In the Cold War, our difficulties were around\ndual-use technology.\nIn the post Cold War, our issues\nare around dual-use data. It has value for both economic and commercial\nas well as scientific and research purposes. Unlike dual-use technology,\nwhere\nthe issue was who gets the technology,\ndual-use data\nraises the issue of by whom should the data be distributed. And it\'s an issue that will not go away and will\ncontinue to develop as we go along.\nAs you add on top of that the high resolution\ncapabilities that are becoming available to the marketplace, we might call it tri-use data. The military effectiveness and the military importance of data will also\ncontinue to be an important issue.\nThis also is going to be an important issue because\nthe value-added\nindustry in remote sensing is currently\nbeing driven by the phenomenal breakthroughs\nin\ncomputer technology and software technology.\nThat\nindustry is growing by leaps and bounds and is one\nwhich will invite U.S. to consider how quickly data\ncan be made available to people in real time around\nthe world. Data is quickly becoming like smoke, but\nhow do you catch it?\nWith that in mind, I\'m going to go to our panel,\nbecause we definitely have a panel of very informed\npeople who I think will give you some very good\nthings to think about. Unlike Theresa, I\'m not a member of the fourth estate, so I can\'t threaten to write\nabout you or not write about you. However,\nI am a\nlawyer, and if you go over time, I\'ll sue you.\nThe first person I\'m going to invite to come up to\nthe stage is John Morgan. He\'s the current director of\nEUMETSAT,\nthe European organization\nfor meteorological satellites. Mr. Morgan has enjoyed three distinct phases in his career in the general field of operational meteorology:\noperational\nweather forecasting,\n\nSENSING:\n\nTHE\n\nEMERGING\n\nERA\n\ncomputer systems, and satellite meteorology.\nIn operational meteorology,\nMr. Morgan worked in the forecast office within the UK and in northern Africa and\nin areas of what is now known as Yemen. And I\'m\nabout to nominate this next sentence for the absolute\nbest sentence I have every come across in a bio. "This\nproved to be an experience of tremendous\nvalue. It is\nvery character forming to be told that the safety of an\nentire squadron of military aircraft flying in close\nformation depends on your accurate forecast for 12\nhours hence."\nBy 1976 the satellite meteorologic\nbranch of the\nUK setup a computer processing screen for the UK\ninstrument stratospheric\nsounding unit to be flown on\nthe polar orbiting satellites of NOAA and the United\nStates. In 1977 Mr. Morgan moved to Germany and\nhelped in the working group that eventually set up\nEUMETSAT\nfor which, in 1986, he was elected as its\nfirst director. So I\'d like to introduce you to Mr. John\nMorgan.\n\nIn the Cold War, our difficulties\ndual-use technology.\n\nIn the post Cold War,\n\nour issues are around dual-use\nvalue for both economic\nwell as scientific\n\nwere around\ndata. It has\n\nand commercial\n\nand research\n\nas\n\npurposes.\n\nMR. MORGAN: Thank you very much, Joanne, for\nthat introduction.\nIt is true that the experience you\nmentioned is character forming. I\'m not sure whether\nthe character is positive or negative as a result, but it\ncertainly made me think.\nThe meeting has been very interesting so far.\nThere\'s been a lot of vision statements,\nwhat\'s going\nto happen to the future of space, man in space, and so\nforth. Now we\'re focusing more on the applications\narea. There is little vision about what I\'m about to tell\nyou. I\'m about to talk about what we\'re actually planning, the reality of one application area. And the\napplication area is meteorology\nand climate studies\nwithin the general application of remote sensing. If I\ncould have the first slide please. (Fig. RS-1)\nEUMETSAT\nis an intergovernmental\norganization. Our members include 17 countries in Europe.\nOne of the interesting aspects of working in such an\norganization\nis that we have to persuade 17 governments every time we want to start something new. So\nI don\'t have much sympathy with your problems here\nin the United States when you only have one.\nBut we do have 17. So far, they\'ve all managed to\nagree on our programs,\nand perhaps we should stop\nsoon while they\'re still agreeing. If I could see the\nnext slide. (Fig. RS-2)\n\n33\n\n1 1TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMI_SIUM\n\nI|----!-I\nI !1 Im\n\nPlanning;\n\n!\n\nin Orbit\n\n17 Member\n\nTo say something about our objectives, our mission statement. What we are about is in the first line.\nWe are to establish European systems of operational\nmeteorological\nsatellites. Those are satellites intended\nto support weather forecasting.\nBut we also have a\nsecondary objective. We know that weather satellites\nare useful for climate studies and detection of climate\ntrends, and therefore we have formally added to our\nmission statement a need to contribute to the operational monitoring of climate. So those are the two\nthings we\'re trying to achieve with our operational\nsystems. If I could have the next slide please. (Fig.\nRS-3)\nThat\'s the planning that we have to do that. The\nfirst half of the slide showing the Meteosat satellites\nare those which are of the current generation, the first\ngeneration of European weather satellites. They\'re all\ngeostationary\nsatellites. Their frequent images cover\nthe whole of Africa, the whole of Europe, the Middle\nEast, and most of the Atlantic. You can see, if you\nlook at the chart carefully, that we plan to have at\nleast two of those in orbit at any one time. In fact, we\nhave four operable satellites in orbit now and that is a\nfeature of the system used for launching satellites. I\'m\nvery anxious that some of the ideas discussed on day\n34\n\nSatellites\n\none come to fruition so we have more efficient systems of launching. We have to plan so far in advance\nof launching a new satellite, we\'re never quite sure if\nthe old one is going to be operable or not when we\nget there.\nConsequently,\nwe\'ve got rather a lot in\norbit at the present time.\nThe present satellite systems, that\'s up to\nMeteosat-7 there, will give U.S. data continuity until\nthe end of this century. Then we\'ve already got funding for the next generation,\nMSG, Meteosat Second\nGeneration.\nIt\'s a new development\nwhich has been\nauthorized and approved. We have funding for all\nthose satellites, which means the 17 countries that I\nmentioned have agreed a program envelope of the\nmoney needed to prepare the satellites, launch them,\nand operate them up until the year 2012.\nSo although this is not a vision statement, we do\nplan quite a way into the future, and we do have the\nmoney in hand to guarantee geostationary\ndata coverage until well into the next century.\nThe third batch of satellites there, EPS, or\nEUMETSAT\nPolar Systems, is our new proposal for\nthe polar orbiting system to match those presently\noperated by the USA. In fact, we\'re doing it in partnership with NOAA, and we expect to have a new\n\nREMOTE\n\nMeteosat\n\nSystem\n\nSENSING:\n\nMSG SEVIRI\n\nSchematic\n\nTHE\n\nEMERGING\n\nChannels\n\nBasic + Airmass\n\n+ Hi Res Vis\nAirmass\nWV6.2\nWV7.3\nIR9.7\nIR 13.4\n\nBand\n(um)\n5.35- 7.15\n6.85- 7.85\n9.46- 9.94\n13.04-13.76\n\nvI8 0.6\nVIS0.8\nIR 1.6\nIR3.8\nIR8.7\n\na=_ (urn)\n0.56-0.71\n0.71- 0.95\n1.44.1,79\n3.40-4.20\n830 - 9.10\n\nIR 10.8\nIR 12.0\n\nHigh\nResVIS __._._mllng\n11.80\n11.00 13.00 HRV\n0.5 - 0.9\n\n9._0\n\n3 km\n\ndata\n\nImages\n\nGround\n\nSystem\n\nFigure\n\nas ,evise_\n\nfor\n\nDe(\n\n_ EUtiIET,.glT\n\n1995\n\nsampling\n\neach\n\nintervals,\n\nHRV\n\n( 1 km)\n\n,\'_ EUA_ETSAT\'=_==_\n\nFigure RS- 7\n\nRS-5\n\nGround Segment\ndata flows\n\nEPS\n\nInstruments\n\nFunction/Satellite\nCORE\n\nMETOP-1\n\nHumidity\n\nInfra-Red\n\nRadiation\n\nIR Sounder\n\nSudace\n\nWinds\n\nImagery\n\nAMSU-A\n\n(AMSU-A)\n\nMHS\n\nMHS\n\nMHS\n\nHIRS\n\n---\n\nIASI\n\nIASI\n\nIASI\n\nAVHRR\n\n(AVHRR)\n\n!

I would expect\nto continue those two streams of satellites, geostationary and polar.\nPerhaps we would split them into\nsmaller missions so that we have even more satellites\nbeyond that date. So let\'s move on to the next slide,\nplease. (Fig. RS-4)\nAs well as the space segment, we have a ground\nsegment reflecting our international\nstatus. Most of the\nprocessing\nis done in Germany where I work, but our\nmain ground system is being refurbished,\nand we have\na new ground station in Italy as well as substations in\nFrance and UK.\nMoving on to the next slide (Fig. RS-5). This\nshows a diagrammatic\nof the systems that we have in\noperation, showing the number of missions that are\nassociated into the satellites. I won\'t go into detail,\nbut I think the main mission is that we distribute to\nsome thousands of user stations images every half an\nhour, day and night, throughout the year. Next slide\n(Fig. RS-6).\n\nThese are the details of the mission, but I won\'t\ndwell on them. I\'ve just been told that I have five\nminutes to go, and I have a few more things to say.\nSo next slide. (Fig. RS-7)\nThis gets down some real numbers for our next\ngeneration.\nOur present satellites have three channels,\nand they image the Earth over the area I mentioned\nevery half an hour. Our next satellites will have 12\nchannels imaging every 15 minutes. The channels on\nthe left are for looking at clouds on the surface of the\nEarth. The channels on the right are mainly to look at\nthe atmosphere\nitself. So this is a meteorological\nsatellite with extensive climatological\ncapabilities.\nThere\'s\nnot much left to know about clouds once you\'ve got\nthis flying and can monitor the evolution of cloud\nsystems, as I said, every 15 minutes, across the whole\narea of the Earth disc. Next slide. (Fig. RS-8)\nOur polar satellite is going beyond the trend mentioned this morning of only having small satellites.\nMentioned several times, perhaps this is the last of the\nbig ones. But our plan at the present is to have a very\ncapable satellite system with all those instruments\nmentioned on the lefthand side flown on the same\nsatellite. The first batch of instruments\nare those operational instruments presently planned to be flown by\n35\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nUsers in Europe\n\nm\n\nMember Slate\nCooperationAgreement\nMDD Licence\nOne or more known\n\nStates\n_.\n\nwith:\nat least one user station\nand an MDD\n\n_t\n\n_\n_\n\nFigure\n\nLicence\n\n.,_EUME\n\nTSA T_\n\nR$-]O\n\nObjectives of EUMETSAT\ndistribution policy\n\ndata\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 develop data exchange between national met services\nwithin WMO\n\xe2\x80\xa2 establish _exchange\nmechanisms taking\naccount of high cost, and commercial value\n\xe2\x80\xa2 _to\nthe long term\n\nglobal data bases, for\n\n.._ EUMETSAT--_.-_\nFigure\n\nRS-I1\n\nNOAA in the same time frame, with the addition of\nan advanced infrared temperature sounder which we\nplan to develop in Europe.\nThe next set of instruments\nof the so-called\nclimate package are those instruments\nwhich are new,\nall developed in Europe, which specifically\nlook at\nvarious aspects of weather and climate. The first one\ngives U.S. the capability to measure surface winds\n36\n\nover the ocean at intervals of some 25 kilometers.\nA\nvery powerful, active radar system. The next is a\npassive microwave image, rather like the SSMI on\nyour military defense meteorological\nsatellites. And\nthen we will monitor ozone and the thermal balance of\nthe Earth\'s system with the last two instruments.\nSo,\nthose very capable satellites are due to be launched\nfrom 2001. We do not have funding approved for this\nsystem yet, but we are reaching a convergence\non the\ninstruments to be flown, and we hope this year to get\nauthorization\nfor the whole package to fly that until\nthe year 2012 or a bit beyond. Next slide please. (Fig.\nRS-9)\nTo show you something of our user base, I show\nthis slide which documents the EUMETSAT\nmember\ncountries. They, of course, get the data without restriction and without any further complication\nother\nthan they fund the whole program according to their\nwealth. That is, Germany pays more than Ireland\nbecause it has a bigger gross national income, and the\npayments for the system are according to that GNP.\nOther countries do not pay according to such a scale.\nNonetheless,\nin the last year since the opening up of\nthe East, we have arranged agreements with the former eastern bloc countries so you see that we\'ve got\ncooperation\nagreements with the Baltic states and the\nwhole of eastern Europe. And even in Russia and\nbeyond there are users of our system. Next slide. (Fig.\nRS-ZO)\nAfrica too is an area which uses this meteorological satellite data very extensively.\nMost countries in\nAfrica shown in blue or yellow have a user station of\nsome kind. Those shaded in blue also have a formal\nagreement with U.S. to receive one of the data missions that we provide, the meteorological\ndata, which\nis a kind of pure communication\nsystem whereby we\nsend meteorological\nproducts such as forecasts to\nthose countries. These and other missions have been\nextraordinarily\neffective in Africa where their local\ncommunication\nsystems are almost negligible.\nWe\'ve\nhad people responsible for meteorological\nservices in\ndifferent countries in Africa coming to us almost with\ntears in their eyes because, using the systems that the\nsatellite provide, they, for the first time, can get information from observing sites a hundred kilometers\ndown the road. It\'s much simpler to use our satellite\nto transmit data, twice times 36,000 kilometers,\nthan\nit is to have a local land line in many parts of Africa.\nSo, as the moderator is standing up, I shall go on\nto the next and last slide (Fig. RS-11) which is just a\nsummary of the systems I\'ve briefly mentioned,\nshowing that we are providing continuous data coverage in\ngeostationary\norbit until at least the year 2012, and\nwe\'re planning polar observations\nfor the same period.\nThank you for your attention.\nPROFESSOR GABRYNOWICZ: Thank you, John.

VernonSinghroy.\nD\nSINGHROY:\nThank\nyou very much, Joanne. Over\nthe past 20 years in this business, I have travelled in\nmany developing countries and I\'ll share of my opinions here vis-a-vis the utility of remote sensing. What\nI plan to do in 10 minutes is just to review briefly the\nneeds, applications,\nopportunities,\nand some of my\nthoughts.\nOver the past 20 years, our use of remote sensing\nis slower than we think based on some of our current\nexperience.\nI cite two statistics here, one in relation to\nfood in Africa, and one on the case of deforestation\nfor which we have a lot of statistics. There are other\ntopographic\nmaps and ground water and so forth. But\nthere is a problem,\na global problem, very acute in the\ndeveloping countries.\nThere is a serious need to strengthen and upgrade\ncurrent remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) to meet the current environmental\nmonitoring\nand natural resource management needs in\ndeveloping nations. Although these technologies\nare\nused routinely by government\nagencies and private\nindustries in developed nations, their utility in developing nations is limited. Full integration of RS/GIS\ntechnologies\nin the institutional\ninfrastructure\nof developing nations can only be realized through staff training, the development\nof skills through pilot studies,\nthe supply of equipment for operational\nwork, followed by timely maintenance,\nand long-term data\nsupply. If the above requirements\ncannot be fulfilled,\nit is better to postpone the development\nof operational\nRS/GIS capability.\nIf you want to develop a market, remote sensing,\nand GIS capabilities,\nthe technology transfer, in our\nopinion, takes more than 10 years. And if we want to\nrely on donors, the World Bank, and, in our case in\nCanada, CITA and so forth, these donor agencies\nusually commit leverage funds only for five to 10\nyears.\nSome developing countries are becoming very\nsophisticated,\nand you see some hot spots in the world\nlike India, Brazil, and a few other countries. As a\nresult of that, one has to compete with those countries. The value-added\nservices from developed nations are also increasing because of the GIS and image\nDR.\n\nTHE EMERGING ERA\n\nprocessing facilities.\nRemote sensing provides a lot of information\nwith\nregard to improved mapping, assessing and monitoring natural resources, land use, land degradation\nand\nhazards. There\'s thousands of case examples within\nand outside of the developing and undeveloped\nworld.\nBecause the resource information\nbase in developing nations is insufficient,\nremote sensing technology\nis very important. An important point to emphasize is\nthat the economies\nin the developing world are mainly\nbased on fishing, agriculture,\nforestry, and mineral\nresources,\nso you need that resource base which remote sensing can provide.\n\nWe\'ve\nmeteorological\n\nhad people responsible\nservices\n\nin different\n\nfor\ncountries\n\nin Africa coming to us almost with tears in\ntheir eyes because,\nthe satellite\n\nprovide,\n\ncan get information\nhundred\n\nusing the systems\n\nthat\n\nthey, for the first time,\nfrom observing\n\nkilometers\n\nsites a\n\ndown the road.\n\nWe hear a lot that global problems need global\nsolutions. Remote sensing and GIS are essential in the\nglobal food security, particularly\nin developing nations. We\'ve seen examples in the press of this. And a\nvery important point if we want to talk about policy in\na real sense is that developing countries do not have\nthe capabilities to compete and to maintain resources\ninventory because they need a micro management\nview apart from the scientific macro view on global\nchange. If you\'re going to do that resource management, we obviously have to make sure that we have a\nfairly accurate inventory of the land mass of the\nworld.\nMarket forces will decrease the price of satellite\ndata, thereby increasing the use in developing countries. There is always a question of price, and a number of countries in the developing world feel that\nsatellite data is very expensive. But as we have more\ncompetition,\nthis obviously facilitates the price.\nThe full potential of remote sensing is through\ndata integration.\nIt\'s very, very important,\nand here\nI\'ll show you some examples. I\'m looking here at the\nmultifaceted\napproach of electeroptical\nand radar data\nand GIS information,\nand I\'ll throw some pretty pictures at you just to have a feel.\nAs we zero in on a micro level to look at the\ndetailed mapping of inventory, we can look at the\ndissection of the landscape--just\nzero in on the detailed scale where we can provide GIS, again using\nthe electeroptical\nsystems of the thematic or spot data\nand imaging radar that provides the cloud-free imagery that gives you the pseudo-stereo\nor topographic\n\n37\n\nI ITH\n\nNATIONAL\n\ncoverage\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nyou need to look at other aspects\n\nof the re-\n\nsources.\n\nNow we always have to look at the market; we\nhave to look at our client. Basically there are two\nclients in the developing world. One, the government,\nand two, the private sector. Government\nprograms\n_--and\nI underline that--large\nvolumes of electeroptical Earth observation\ndata, radar data, and so\nforth, particularly\nfor regulation and for public good\nprocesses. The private sector, on the other hand, are\nclients that use the remote sensing to gain the commercial advantage, the value-added services, and so\nforth.\n\nMarket forces will decrease\nsatellite\n\nthe price of\n\ndata, thereby\n\nincreasing\n\ndeveloping\n\nthe use in\n\ncountries.\n\nWe are launching Radar Sat in the fall, and as a\nresult, we will have a fairly extensive program flying\napproximately\n15 to 20 countries--over\n40 test\nsites--trying\nto educate the user in technology transfer\npilot programs and so forth. As a result of training\nthese countries will know how to use imaging radar in\ntheir day-to-day activities at the micro level or at the\nregional level. This Canadian GlobeSar program is\nobviously a data acquisition for Sar data, training and\ntechnology transfer, to hone in on the market. It is led\nby the agency I work for, the Canada Center for Remote Sensing, in cooperation\nwith the Canadian Space\nAgency and the Canadian and Radar Sat International,\nbasically about 40 sites from a number of disciplines.\nHere are a few pretty pictures, showing examples\nof GlobeSar and particularly\ndistressed integration and\nthe multifaceted\napproach of localized remote sensing\n(figures unavailable).\nHere we look at the coastal\nareas of Guyana where you have a LandSat thematic\nmapper draped over a Sar imagery. In that particular\narea, for the 20 odd years of LandSat program, that\'s\nthe only cloud-free imagery we\'ve got. Particularly\nfor global change, look at the flooding. There\'s a\nbillion dollars in the coastline for degradation\nof land\nat sea level ranges and so forth.\nHere is the same area again looking at the LandSat thematic and various enhance programs and degradation of the environment\napart from providing information in near surface coastal areas and coastal patterns of the water.\nHere\'s an example of detailed land use classification, from over-cut forests to degraded land to agricultural land use and so forth, whereby these can provide\nthe developing world, in this case Guyana, with land\ncover information\nfor that result from agenda to anyone from the real conference.\nSatellite remote sensing is obviously needed for\nsustainable development\nand environmental\nprotection\n38\n\nin the developing world. And to follow up on what\nDr. C6rdova, NASA\'s chief scientist, said last night,\nthe space community needs to foster and strengthen\nour ties. I think we need a four-lane highway here\ngoing back and forth to the developing world and in\nthe developed world providing training, technology\ntransfer, pilot programs.\nThese are time consuming\nprocesses. We need to train the groups in the developing world because through training we can foster a\nmore global and commercial\nprogram. Thank you.\nPROFESSOR GAIIRYNOWlCZ: When we were planning\nthis session, I talked to Vernon about it and he gave\nme some very interesting statistics, one that I would\nencourage anybody interested in commercial\nopportunities to do a lot of homework in. For example, the\nentire remote sensing budget, national budget, for\nGuyana is $50,000 a year. So there has to be some\nreal marketing done.\nAlso, the other thing, it would appear the threats\nof lawsuits are more effective than the threat of not\nbeing written about because we\'re on time. Our next\nspeaker has threatened not to be on time, so I\'m\nwarning him now: Be on time. We\'re inviting up to\nthe podium Dr. Murray Felsher who began his career\nin remote sensing, is a graduate and research teaching\nassistant in Photogeology\nat the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and received his Ph.D. from the\nUniversity of Texas in Austin. He taught graduate and\nundergraduate\ncourses in oceanography\nand geology at\nSyracuse University.\nHe has a very long and distinguished career in both the public and the private sectors, including working at EPA and NASA. He worked at NASA Headquarters\nas chief of Geological and\nEnergy Applications\nand in the private sector he has\nbeen a consultant. His clients include Eastman Kodak,\nLogicon, Ultra Systems, Orbital Sciences, and Eyeglass.\nSince 1981, Dr. Felsher has continuously published the Washington\nRemote Sensing Letter, and he\nis currently the chairman of the American Society of\nPhotogrometry\nand Remote Sensing Committee on\nSatellite Mapping and Remote Sensing. What he will\nbe speaking to us about today is the industry viewpoint. He is the founding director of something called\nthe North American Remote Sensing Industries Association, and I\'ll let him tell you what the acronym is\nbecause it gets badly battered. Dr. Felsher.\nDR. II_tSnER: Thank you, Joanne. My comments this\nmorning are digests of a more complete presentation\nwhich I have submitted to the organizers\nof this conference for publication\nin the Symposium\nProceedings.\nTHE NORTH\nINDUSTRIES\n\nAMERICAN\nREMOTE SENSING\nASSOCIATION\n(NARSIA)\n\nI appear before you today wearing a relatively\nnew hat. The formation of the North American Re-\n\nREMOTE\n\nmoteSensing\nIndustries\nAssociation, NARSIA,is a\nor\nratherrecentevent.Ourfirst AnnualCongress was\nheld barely nine weeks ago, and it drew representatives from 62 companies covering the broad spectrum\nof data providers,\nhardware/software\ndevelopers,\nvalue-added image information\norganizations,\nand\ncommercial\nend-users. In fact, this, the first effort to\nunite the common interests of the whole industrial\nbody that deals with remote sensing products and\nservices, was deemed a success. What I would like to\ndo this morning is spend a few minutes (1) tracing the\ngenealogy and current status of this activity, (2) outlining its charter and general purposes, and, perhaps\nmost importantly,\n(3) substantiating\nthe role of the\nend-user community\nin defining the ongoing applications of satellite and aircraft remote sensing.\n\nThe veritable\ngovernment\n\nlacuna that has served as\ncivil space remote sensing\n\npolicy, since 1972, has made few look good\nand nobody\n\nproud.\n\nGenealogy and current status: No attempt to trace the\nhistory of a remote sensing industries association\nwould be possible without the acknowledgment\nof the\nprime relevance of the U.S. Landsat program. Most\neveryone in this room--certainly\nthose of us involved\nin the Landsat program as government\nor private\nsector employees, consultants,\nmedia, principal investigators or academicians--are\nfully aware of the\nday-to-day travails, successes, failures, twists, turns,\nand fiascoes related to that program since the launch\nof Landsat-I in 1972. The veritable lacuna that has\nserved as government\ncivil space remote sensing policy, since 1972, has made few look good and nobody\nproud. I will spend no time this morning certifying\nthat random walk for you, but please believe me that\nit has been painful, trying, and altogether frustrating-for\neveryone concerned. The interim years from\nthe then of global technological\nleadership and innovation accorded to the U.S. in this field--to the now,\nwhere the U.S. has been barely able to maintain a\nviable presence is, surely, an attestation to the penalty\nthat will always be paid for muddled planning and\nhesitant implementation.\nThat muddling is not only to\nbe laid at the feet of the various agency and congressional entities responsible for our civil remote sensing\nefforts. Equally culpable has been (1) the lack of a\nunified industrial constituency\nwilling and able to join\ntogether to undertake the necessary outreach activities\naimed at those very same legislative and executive\nbranch institutions and (2) the lack of a unified and\nvocal end-user constituency\nwilling and able to certify\nthe beneficial applications\nof remote sensing.\n\nSENSING:\n\nTHE EMERGING\n\nERA\n\nAnd so Landsat proceeded,\nsmugly and blindly,\nfrom the Principal Investigator-based,\nNASA-ownership paradigm of the \'70s, through the NOAA-ownedbut-disavowed\noperational/commercial\neffort of the\n\'80s, to the DoD/NASA-aborted\nengagement\nof the\nearly \'90s, to the recent NASA/NOAA/USGS\nshotgun\nmarriage,\nand to the just-reported\ncivil suit in federal\ncourt, brought by the current operator. This 23-year\nprogrammatic\nand bureaucratic\ndreamtime walkabout\naside, the end result, insofar as Landsat is concerned,\nhas been universal bewilderment--no\nmore and no\nless. The U.S., certainly the global technological\nleader in satellite remote sensing--whether\nby wistful\nignorance of plan or by whimsical circumstance\nof\nchance--has,\njust as certainly, abdicated that leadership. The French, the Japanese, the Russians, the\nIndians, and others, understanding\nthat it is better to\nbuild and own a space-segment\nsystem than it is to\nrent and pay royalties for a ground-segment\npicture,\nsingle-minded,\n(and in some instances with U.S. government assistance),\nhave all been steadily increasing\ntheir remote sensing smarts and market share, at the\nsame time as they decrease the distance between themselves and putative remnants of U.S. leadership in the\nfield. And mind you, right here at the outset, I make\nno apologies this morning in speaking for and seeking\nAmerican predominance,\nboth commercially\nand technologically\nin this most vital field of endeavor. I have\nno problem with international\ntechnological\ncooperation; I simply insist that the cooperation\nbe fostered\nfrom a position of U.S. strength. In a time when U.S.\ntechnology is being inexorably rotated into an international mindset, including everything\nfrom the information superhighway\nto the ever-shrinking\nspace station,\nI happily note that Cheyenne Mountain is still not yet\nunder United Nations control.\n\nI have no problem\ntechnological\n\nwith international\n\ncooperation;\n\nthat the cooperation\n\nI simply\n\nbe fostered\n\ninsist\n\nfrom a\n\nposition of U.S. strength.\n\nBut I digress. The point is that for many years\npolicy and laws related to civil space remote sensing\nwere contemplated,\ndiscussed, considered,\nenacted,\nand promulgated\nwithout adequate input from that\nvery industrial and commercial\nbase that would be\nmost affected by those policies and laws. As U.S.\ncivilian multispectral\nscanner, thematic mapper, and\nAVHRR space imagery began to permeate through the\ninternational\narena, in-country expertise and technology began to grow, and similar concerns as expressed\nhere were being replicated by commercial\nand industrial entities overseas as well. In December of 1993 a\ngroup of European companies met in Geneva to dis39\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\ncuss the formation of a users group. A formal structure for this European group, which now includes data\nproviders as well, has been formulated\nat a meeting\nheld in Paris on March 7 of this year. In February\n1994 another group met in Melbourne with the same\nidea, and it is my understanding\nthat similar groups\nare in planning stages both in Asia and in Latin America. We recognize the fact that the programs of each\nof these regional associations\nwill reflect the concerns\nand idiosyncrasies\nof that particular region. In fact,\nthe terms of reference of any one regional association\nmight very well include specific principles whose\ntenets could be diametrically\nopposed to those of\nanother regional association.\nIf so, then so be it.\nThere is nothing wrong with that, and, in fact, it is\nthe major reason why any one international\ngroup of\nthis sort would be doomed to failure. Make no mistake, international\ncooperation\nin the diplomatic sense\nnotwithstanding,\nit is international\ncompetition\nin the\ncommercial\nsense that makes the world go \'round, and\nI would rather it be U.S. satellite remote sensing\ncommercial\nentities that dominate the global scene (no\npun intended) than those of any other country. And\nthat brings us to NARSIA\'s charter and purposes.\n\nThe majority,\notherwise\nAmericans,\nphrase,\n\nindeed the vast majority\n\nsophisticated,\n\nare still wholly unaware\n"remote\n\nsensing."\n\naware of the benefits\n\nalready\n\nof the\n\nNor are they\nderived from\n\nthat activity and the expectations\nbeneficial\n\nof\n\nwell-educated\n\npayoffs from satellites\nlaunched.\n\nof future\nnot yet\n\nCharter and Purposes: The well-attended\nFirst Annual\nCongress of the North American Remote Sensing\nIndustries Association\nincluded breakout sessions\nwhich allowed the attendees to help frame the charter\nand terms of reference of the organization.\nMore than\nthat, the participants\nclearly validated the philosophical pillars that form the four underlying purposes of\nthe organization.\nBriefly, and in no order of importance, they are (1) Government\ninterfacing (2) Education and outreach (3) Marketing\nand (4) International\ninteraction. Allow me to say a few words about each.\n(1) Government Interfacing:\nThe brief recital of\nangst related to Landsat that marked my initial comments this morning highlight but the tip of the proverbial iceberg familiar to all facets of our commercial\nand industrial community.\nAnd that community has\nindeed been moved to the hard realization and acknowledgment\nthat in order to be effectively heard by\nthose who enact laws and those who promulgate pol40\n\nicy we must organize and bring together the whole\nsweep of activities that fall under the rubric of remote\nsensing enterprises.\nThat is, NARSIA, to be a compelling force, must engage (a) those data providers who\nbuild and fly Earth-viewing\nspacecraft and sensors, (b)\nthose commercial houses that write lines of code, and\n(c) those facilities that bend Earth-bound\nmetal. These\ninclude industries that work in areas as diverse as\nspace-segment\ncommand and control and ground-segment Earth stations. We must sign up those firms that\ntake the "zeros" and "ones" emanating from the Earth\nstation pipe and manipulate,\nenhance, and otherwise\nconvert those numerical data into digital image information. We must sign up those firms that merge the\ndigital image information\nwith other disparate digital\ndata sets to create a value-added image product. We\nmust sign up those firms that analyze and interpret\nthat image product in response to a specific requirement from a paying end-user. And again, perhaps\nmost important, we must sign up those paying\nend-user entities that would purchase and employ the\nfinal remote sensing-based\nimage product as part of\ntheir own commercial\nactivity or intellectual pursuit.\nThese are the members we seek. And with the breadth\nand depth thus acquired, NARSIA will be a telling\nforce in placing forth the viewpoint of a constituency,\nfinally united, to policy-making\nand law-enacting\ngovernment bodies. NARSIA will prepare and distribute issue papers and white papers. We will testify\nbefore legislative bodies. We will serve on executive\nbranch advisory committees.\nWe will create a situation such that when an agency or a subcommittee\nis\ncontemplating\nan action that deals with remote sensing, someone will always automatically\nsay, "Get\nsomeone from NARSIA to provide us. with the industry\'s and end-users\'\npoint of view." And mind you,\nthis is not being offered in any negative way. That is,\nwe feel that both congress and the federal agencies,\nrather than working blindly as they have all these\nyears, those bodies have frantically been seeking such\nan organization\nas NARSIA to provide them with the\ninput they really need. And so, with the ink hardly\ndry on NARSIA\'s Terms of Reference document, we\nhave already delivered a talk at last month\'s Goddard\nSymposium,\nand we\'re here today. We\'ll be speaking\nat the Fifth Annual Small Satellite Industry Policy,\nRegulatory\nand Financial Conference\nto be held at the\nNational Press Club in Washington\nD.C. next month.\nIn addition, we have been contacted by NASA to\nprovide a full session of NARSIA member speakers\nfor the upcoming NASA/NOAA/USGS-sponsored\nASPRS Conference\non Land Satellite Data Needs,\nscheduled for this September.\nAnd we have just\nlearned that next year\'s U.S. Space Foundation\nnational symposium,\nhere at this venue, will include a\nmajor session comprising\nthe international\nremote\nsensing industry associations,\nat which NARSIA will,\nof course, be proud to participate.\nIndeed, NARSIA\n\nREMOTE SENSING: THE EMERGING ERA\n\nwill provide coherent, cohesive, and cogent information to government\nagencies and all other audiences.\n(2) Education and outreach: The majority, indeed\nthe vast majority of otherwise sophisticated,\nwell-educated\nAmericans,\nare still wholly unaware of\nthe phrase, "remote sensing."\nNor are they aware of\nthe benefits already derived from that activity and the\nexpectations\nof future beneficial payoffs from satellites\nnot yet launched. Yet, ironically enough, our remote\nsensing community has already had clear evidence of\nthe impact of a strong, empowered public as related to\nremote sensing. I speak of the attempt by the Department of Commerce\nto privatize the U.S. meteorological satellite system, along with Landsat, back in the\nearly 1980s. The ensuing public uproar prevented\nCommerce from offering up the metsats, even though\nby any measure the meteorological\nsatellites were (and\nstill are) far more operational than were the Landsat\nsatellites. The difference was in the public\'s perception of the metsat data versus the esoteric, strangely\ncolored Landsat imagery. Indeed, we need no "N E\ndelta rho," signal-to-noise-ratio,\nIFOV techno-babble\nhere. The public saw (and sees) metsat imagery on the\nsix o\'clock news. Cloud patterns, easily visible and\nrecognizable,\nmarch eastward across the TV every\nday, right after the sport highlights and before the guy\nand gal anchors perform their nightly banter with the\nweatherman.\nEvery day. And the public made its\nviews known very quickly. That immediate and unequivocal public response crystallized\nthe federal\ngovernment\'s\ndecision-making\nprocess--nearly\ninstantaneously. And the metsats were taken off the auction\nblock.\nNARSIA will engage in whatever activities are\nnecessary to bring the general public up a learning\ncurve that culminates in an appreciation\nof remote\nsensing as a commercial\nexercise necessary to the\ngood and welfare of the community at large. This will\ninclude all the classic tools, from newsletters\nto press\nreleases. It will also incorporate the newer information\ndissemination\ndevices as well, as the World Wide\nWeb of the Internet. We do recognize, as did the\ncomputer industry early on, the value of early intervention, and so will participate in programs,\nas the\nNASA K-12 project that will bring space-derived\nimagery to the public schools via the Internet. A future voting public that became remote-sensing-literate\nas youngsters\nis a much more effective constituency\nthan is the current adult voting public--one\nthat must\nundergo very "basic training,"\nas it were. In addition,\nNARSIA will engage in curriculum\ndevelopment\nfor\ncollege and university classes to ensure a well-trained\nand continuous flow of professional\ntalent into the\ntechnological\nworkplace.\nAnd, as we grow, we plan to\nconduct in-service seminars so as to provide continuing educational opportunities\nfor members.\n(3) Marketing: NARSIA\'s\nthird underlying purpose falls under the title of "marketing."\nBeginning\nwith the 1984 Landsat Commercialization\nRFP issued\n\nby the Department\nof Commerce,\nmany of U.S. have\nbeen engaged in providing what we would like to\nbelieve are sophisticated\nmarket surveys. These surveys, and the market research and intelligence that\ninvariably accompanies them, purport to speak to the\npresent status and expected future growth of the various GIS/remote sensing market segments as best perceived. In truth, and as a well-paid consultant and\nauthor of several of these studies, I must admit that\nthey are little more than WAGS--Wild\nAss Guesses.\nThose of us, who as consultants have guessed better\nthan others have been rewarded with our growing\nclient lists. This is satisfying in a pragmatic\nsense--after\nall, it will be paying medical school tuition for our youngest. But it is altogether unsatisfying\nin a professional\nsense. Until now there has been no\nreal way of tapping into the actual resources of the\nremote sensing community as a whole to provide the\nquantity and quality of input necessary to build the\nkind of database that would truly define the remote\nsensing marketplace.\nNARSIA is attempting to show\nthat by compiling such non-competitive,\nnon-proprietary information\nas is resident in its member-company\'s\ndatabases, NARSIA will be able to\nconstruct, for the first time, a true picture of the marketing regimen now extant. Further, and more important, we will be able to predict, with much more certainty than hitherto possible, future market segment\npaths that will define our industry\'s growth. With\neach member company contributing\nits own portion of\nmarket survey, research, and intelligence,\nwe will be\nable to construct a whole whose predictability,\nvalidity, and verifiability\nwill be far greater than the sum\nof its parts. And so, as an internal exercise, NARSIA\nwill serve as a central switchboard\nas well as a distribution point for market data and information\nfrom and\nto its members.\n\nAs we view the Earth from space, we are\nalmost never able to perceive\nboundaries.\n\nnational\n\nAnd to speak of imaging\n\nEarth is to automatically\n\nrecognize\n\nthe\n\nthe global\n\nnature of that endeavor.\n\n(4) International\ninteraction: Lest you label me, in\nface of my earlier comments,\nas an atavistic, troglodytic isolationist,\nplease know that I am none of these.\nYes, the technology of remote sensing was indeed\ninvented in the U.S. And yes, if the business of remote sensing were to be dominated by U.S. industry,\nI would not be upset. But the reality of remote sensing\nis its international\naspect. As we view the Earth from\nspace, we are almost never able to perceive national\nboundaries.\nAnd to speak of imaging the Earth is to\nautomatically\nrecognize the global nature of that en41\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\ndeavor. And as noted earlier there are several regional\norganizations\nbeing formed that may very well clone\nour own NARSIA efforts in other parts of the world.\nAnd even though we expect the U.S. commercial\nproviders as EarthWatch\nand Space Imaging, Inc. to\nbe the ultimate framework\nupon which will be papered\nsupplemental\ngovernment-provided\nspace-derived\ndata,\nit is fair to say that as of this date the only Earthviewing satellites up there providing U.S. with imagery are government-owned.\nAnd here I include Landsat, SPOT, the U.S. metsats, Japan\'s MOS-I, JERS,\nESA\'s ERS, India\'s IRS, and all the rest. Today, the\nworld below is being viewed by a government-owned\nworld above. As such, it behooves U.S. at NARSIA\nto not only be cognizant of that truth, but to also\nrespond appropriately\nto its ramifications.\nNamely,\nNARSIA will provide whatever input necessary to\nCEOS--the\nCommittee on Earth Observing Satellites-the\ngovernmental\nagency which serves as the\ninternational\nforum for space-faring,\nEarth-sensing\nnations. In addition, NARSIA will cooperate with any\ninternational,\nbinational,\nor multinational\norganization\nseeking its input. In our role as the spokesman for the\ncommercial,\nthat is, nongovernmental\nremote sensing\ncommunity,\nwe feel that it is necessary for our own\nbenefit, as well as any government\'s\nbenefit, to be\nfully aware of the principals\nand points of view generated by NARSIA. As such, though NARSIA is indeed\ncomprised of a very specific band of cohorts, with a\nvery specific commercial\nagenda, we view remote\nsensing as a truly global activity, with benefits and\nresponsibilities\nthat exist beyond the geographic limits\nof its membership.\n\nRemote\n\nsensing applications\n\nmajor domain and discipline\n\ncross every\nfrom\n\nagronomy\n\nto zoology.\n\nNARSIA and the end-user community:\nPlease believe\nthat much of the turmoil and confusion permeating\nthrough government\nreports and policy statements is\nlittle more than semantic. There has been an inability,\non all our parts, to provide a universally\nagreed-upon\ndefinition of a "user." Is a user the firm that purchases a SPOT image to which it will add value and resell? Is a user a federal government\nagency that trades\nits image tapes to a sister government\nagency? Is a\nuser a GIS firm that purchases an image analysis\npackage from a software house? Yes, indeed, they are\nall users, for if they are not users then what are they?\nBut in terms of concern to NARSIA, and in terms of\nconcern to our industry, they are not a user with an\nuppercase "U." There is only one kind of uppercase\n"U" user, and that is the End-User. How do we recognize him? Well, his first major characteristic\nis that\nhe resides at the terminus--the\nfar end--of the remote\n42\n\nsensing chain. As we go from space segment to\nground segment, and within the ground segment from\nthe "zeros and ones" sliding out of the ground station,\nto a finished piece of image-based\ninformation,\nwe\nindeed pass through legions of using entities and customers. However, the only REAL user is the fellow at\nthe end of that long interactive purchaser-buyer\nline\nthat pays for that final piece of image-based\ninformation. He\'s the end user, and he\'s the one that counts.\nAnd that\'s the second major characteristic\nof the\nend-user, ladies and gentlemen.\nHe pays. A service\nand/or a product is offered to meet the specific and\nstated need and requirement\nset forth. And the enduser accepts that service and/or product in exchange\nfor cash. In kind of reverse phytoplankton-like,\nbase-of-the-food-chain\nconcept, it is the multitudinous\nend-user community that ultimately fuels the business,\ncommerce, and industry of remote sensing. The building and launching of the spacecraft, the fabrication of\nthe sensor, the construction\nof the Earth station, the\nintegration of these systems, the writing of lines of\ncode for ever-more sophisticated\nanalysis software,\nand the technology explosion to accept that software\ninto a desktop workstation--the\nfuture of all of\nthis--insofar\nas is concerned the civilian commercial\nremote sensing industry--is\nin the hands of the enduser. An expanding,\nknowledgeable,\nand paying enduser community is the sine qua non for our industry.\nThe feeding, comfort, and growth of that customer\nbase should be our first concern. Though its existence\nwill never ensure our success, be advised that its nonexistence will certainly ensure our failure.\nRemote sensing applications\ncross every major\ndomain and discipline from agronomy to zoology. The\nvery sweep of applications\nhas been given as a prime\nreason for the inability of the industrial community to\nheretofore organize itself and aggressively\nmove the\nbusiness of remote sensing into the civilian commercial arena. And we agree with this assessment.\nBut in\nthe past this has led to little more than great sighs of\nneglect and retreat, by industry, to a fall-back position. And this fall-back position has always been the\ncomfort blanket provided by the several federal agencies that make up the defense and intelligence community. Well, the world is changing. I am one who believes that the changes we have seen these last years,\nand those we can expect to see in the years ahead,\nwill call for more comprehensive\nreconnaissance,\nmonitoring,\nand surveillance\nactivities by that established customer base. But I also know that a merchant\nthat relies on but a single customer is one of two\nthings. He\'s either foolishly ill-advised or he\'s\nill-advisedly foolish. Budgetary and programmatic\nuncertainties\nnotwithstanding,\nit makes no sense to\nrecognize the impact that remote sensing has across\nthe entire sweep of civilian applications,\nand not take\nadvantage of the opportunities\nthus presented.\nAnd so NARSIA has created a class of membership for the paying\n\nend-user,\n\nthus incorporating\n\nhis\n\nREMOTE\n\nBACKGROUND\nEVENTS\nCONVERGENCE\n\nCONVERGENCE\nOF\nU.S. POLAR-ORBITING\nOPERATIONAL\nENVIRONMENTAL\nSATELLITE\nSYSTEMS\n\nSince\n\n1972,\n\neight\n\nCongressional\n\nstudies\n\nJune\nasked\n\nPrasldentlal\n\nROBERT\n\n11 TH NATIONAL\nAPRIL\n\nFigure\n\nSPACE\n\nAND\n\nIntegrated\nOperational\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\n5,1995\n\nRS-12\n\nknowledge and expectations,\nand so ensuring ourselves of the timely and appropriate\ninput by the membership dwelling at the front end of the space- and\nground-segment\nfood chain.\nI look forward to as many of you as possible, both\nas individuals and as corporate entities, joining us.

Mr. Robert Winokur.\nMR. WINOKUR: Thank you, Joanne. My vision for\nthe future, if I was asked about two years ago, probably never included standing up here talking about the\nsubject I\'m about to talk about. Two years ago or so I\nwas busy in the Pentagon trying to convince flag\nofficers that satellite oceanography\nwas an important\nelement of what we did in anti-submarine\nwarfare and\nsupport to Naval operations in coastal environments.\nBut the world changes; my visions changed, and, so,\nhere I am.\n\nERA\n\npoeelbillty\n\nof convergence\n\n1993,\n\nSenator\n\nPerformance\nDecision\n\nJames\nreview\n\nHouse\n\nExon\nof DOC-DOD-NASA\n\nReview,\n\nSeptember\n\nDirective\n\nsigned,\n\nprograms\n\n1993\nMay\n\n1994\n\n"...REDUCE\nTHE COST OF ACQUtRING\nAND OPERATING\nPOLARORBITING\nENVIRONMENTAL\nSATELLITE\nSYSTEMS,\nWHILE\nCONTINUING\nTO SATISFY\nU_S.

This is a tri-agency program.\nIt\'s dual use, I think, taken probably to its end because we are converging\nand merging a civilian system with a military system. I think that\'s very appropriate in today\'s world, and it particularly\nsupports\nVice President Gore\'s notion and vision for reinventing government.\nBut more importantly,\nI\'m the visible\nspokesman here today for an effort that has been\nundertaken by numerous people from NOAA, from\nthe Air Force, from NASA, and the Office of Science\nand Technology\nPolicy. So I am here as the lead\nspokesman and because I have the lead for putting it\ntogether. But I do want to tell you that a lot of people\nhave worked to make this happen.\nNext slide please (Fig. RS-13). Since 1972 people\nhad visions to make this happen. The vision got\nblurred somewhere along the way, and for numerous\nand valid reasons, convergence\nof the nation\'s civilian\nand military systems was not possible. It is possible\ntoday for a number of reasons, not the least of which\nis that both programs are in the early stages of a block\nupgrade. There was Congressional\ninterest last year,\nfollowed by the National Performance\nReview in\nwhich the Vice President directed the agencies to take\na look at putting together a plan to make polar convergence happen. That was then followed by a Presidential Decision Directive on May 5 of last year (1994)\nthat directed the agencies to proceed to reduce the cost\nof acquiring and operating the nation\'s polar orbiting\nenvironmental\nsatellite systems while continuing to\nsatisfy U.S. operational\nrequirements.\nA very, very\nimportant point. We opened our office for business,\nwe got on with it on October 1 of last year, the beginning of the fiscal year.\nThe next slide is a very brief example (Fig. RS-14).\nThe civilian community has been flying polar orbiting\nsatellites for many, many years. These data not only\nsupport the National Weather Service, but they\'re\nused for a variety of activities: climate studies, ozone,\nmonitoring\nforest fires, and volcano eruptions to support FAA operations.\nWhen I was working for the\n43\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nKEY PARAMETERS--FUTURE\nMETEOROLOGICAL\n\nSATELLITE\n\nDOD/AF\n\nMILITARY\n\nSVs\'i_M\'EV6LUTiON\n\nDODIAF\n\n_,,_D,__\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nx\n\n_=,_,,,\n\n_\n"_\n\nIP.0_\nI .,=oEss_\n\nO\nV.L\n\n=\n\n_.*,.\n\n.a\n\n_lr,;_\n\nb,,.,*,\n\nso=._.,\n\nx\n\nx\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nx\n\nx\n\ns\xc2\xa2.i.b.g\n\n]_=,,m\n_g_ng\n\nR,t\xc2\xb0_ut_.\nSp.a,og.ph\n\nE.T\xe2\x80\xa2m\n\n__\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nx\n\nSour_llng\nclmate\n\nOVER 30 YEARS\n\nFigure\n\nOF CONTINUOUS\n\nRS-]#\n\nFigure\n\nKEY\n\nPARAMETERS\n\n--\n\n__\n\nSERVICE\n\nRS-16\n\nCONVERGED\n\nCURRENT\n\nSYSTEM MANAGEMENT\nTRI-AGENC\xc2\xa5\n\nKEY PAR/MITERS\n\npo\xc2\xa2,_\n\n_lt BlrlWG FJt\'VlRONME;VTALSATELLITE\n\nHIGH*ESOLUr_N\nINF_eO\nWCROWAVE S_OI_\nUNIT\n\nEXECUTIVE\nCOMMITrEE\n\nOMSP\n\nSOURER.\nseNsoR\n\nMicrowAve\n\nWA_R\nIPO\n\nSYSTEM\n\nPFICd_RAM\n\nI_REC\'TOR\nVERrlc_t\n\nIe_peR*TURe\n\nP_O_ILe\n\nSeECI_\nle_BOM U_CR_AVe\nTe=PE_A_U_E\nSO_I\n\xe2\x80\xa2 a_C_L\n\nCLOUD _MA_Y\n\nSeA tCE\n\nSe_ SURF*C_ re_P_TU_E\n\nMO_=_URe\n\nseecl_\n\nseusoR\n\nM_CeOWAW IM_OER\n\nSeA SUnFACE W_OS\n\nS_eCl_\n\n_E_O_\n\nM_OWAVe\n\n_L\n\ntMAGen\n.eo=_euems\nFR_\nAGENCtES\n\nFigure\n\nRS-15\n\nNavy, we used the NOAA sea-surface temperature\ndata on a routine basis.\nLikewise, the military relies very, very heavily to\nsupport its global operations\non satellites for weather\nsupport. I was in the unenviable position a couple of\ntimes after Desert Storm trying to explain to various\nflag officers from battlegroups\nwhy we didn\'t do a\nvery good job of predicting the weather over Baghdad. But we tried, and we tried to explain that it was\na very, very difficult thing to do, but one has to clearly rely on the satellite information\nto do that, as well\nas in situ observations.\nSo where are we? We have 30 years of history of\noperating two separate polar-orbiting\nsatellite systems\nin the U.S.--a\nmilitary one and a civilian one. DoD\nwas proceeding on a Block 6 upgrade in DMSP,\nNOAA was proceeding on a Block upgrade with its\nTIROS series and the O,P,Q series. The Presidential\nDecision Directive says take the two series, merge\nthem together into something that we now call\nNPOESS, the National Polar-Orbiting\nOperational\nEnvironmental\nSatellite System and that\'s managed\nthrough the office I mentioned previously called the\nIntegrated Program Office or the IPO. So we\'ve taken\n30 years of heritage, and we\'re combining it into a\n44\n\nFigure\n\n.......\n\nRS-17\n\nsingle national polar program. The next two slides\nshow current and future key parameters\n(Figs. RS15,;6).\nWe put in place a management\norganization\nthat\nwas outlined in the Presidential\nDecision Directive\n(Fig. RS-17). We have a System Program Director, and\nI have the dubious distinction of being the Acting\nProgram Director until we have a real person on\nboard, hopefully very soon. That will be a NOAA\nemployee. NOAA has the lead for putting the program\ntogether and housing the program. The Deputy Director will come from DoD.\nThis is a tri-agency program. We have three senior positions in the office. One is the associate director for acquisition. That person will come from the\nAir Force, and the Air Force has the lead role in\nproviding support for acquisition.\nSo we\'re using Air\nForce and DoD acquisition procedures,\nthe 5000 Series, if you will. We have an associate director for\ntechnology transition.\nThat person will be provided by\nNASA and will lead the way in our technology studies. And we finally have an Associate Director for\nOperations and Operations will be housed in NOAA\nand that person will come from NOAA.\n\nREMOTE\n\nCONVERGENCE\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nSENSING:\n\nTHE\n\nEMERGING\n\nERA\n\nSYNCHRONIZATION\n\nPROCESS\nDMSP\n053o\n=\n\nt\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nJoint\n\nAgency\n\nRequirements\n\nGroup\n\n(JARG)\n\ndefine\n0730\n\nrequirements\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEach\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ninitial\n\noperational\n\nrequirements\n\nused\n\nlORD\n\nIssued\n\nto\n\nIntegrated\n\nProgram\n\nog30\n\nas\n\npoint\n\nPreliminary\n\n0830\n\n_\n\nagency\'s\n\nstarting\n\nOffice,\nN\'\n\nJanuary\n\n9, 1995\n\nfor\n\nPhase\n\n0\n\n1330\nNOAA-PM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIntegrated\nfinalized\n\n-\n\nOperational\nafter\n\nCost\n\nbenefits\n\nRequirement\n\nFigure\n\nPhase\n\nRequirements\n0 studies\n\nanalysis\nissues\n\nto\n\nand\n\nDocument\ntrades\n\nbetter\n\nworked\n\ndefine\n\nthrough\n\n(lORD)\n\nare accomplished.\n\narchitecture\nengineering\n\ntrades\n\nFigure\n\nRS-18\n\nRS-20\n\nCANDIDATE CONVERGED\nCONSTELLATION PAYLOADS\nVERTICAL\n0S30A\n\n._\':_\n\n\'\n\n_\n\n":\n\nMOISTURE\n\nSATM01\n\nL\n\n:\n\n_;\n\n_+.\'_\'_-_,++\n\n\' *\n\nPROFILE\n\n_\n:_\n\n+ "\n\n,\nM\n\nM\n\n:_\n\n-%\n\nI\n\nPROFILE\n\n_i\n\nS\n\n.\n\n_ ::\n\n3"\n\nG\n\'\n\n\'_\n\nR\n\n....\n\nO\n\nI\n\nTEMPERATURE\n\nC )\n\nU\n\nVERTICAL\n\nOASIS\n\nOASIS\nMISS\n\nAMSU-A1\nAMSU-A2\nMITS\nSEM\nS&R\nARGOS\n\nAMSU-I\nMHS\nAIRS/ITS\nSBUV\nSESS\nS&R\n\nIASI\nGOME\nSCARAB\n\nMISS\nSESS\nARGOS\nMSTRS\n\nAVHRR\nMIMI\n\n:\n\n_\n\nN\n\nU\n\nARGOS\nMSTRS\n\nSEA,CE\nSEA\n\nRS-I9\n\nOutside that box, very importantly,\nis the requirements process (Fig. RS-18). We will define the operational requirements,\nI have to underscore\nthe word\n"operational."\nThis is not a research program;\nthis is\nan operational\nsupport program. Those requirements\nwill then be given to the System Program Director for\nexecution. The program will report to a tri-agency\nExecutive Committee made up of Undersecretaries-the Undersecretary\nof Commerce for Oceans and\nAtmosphere,\nthe Undersecretary\nof DoD for Acquisition and Technology,\nand the Deputy Administrator\nat\nNASA.\nWe have a notional architecture\nright now. The\non-orbit constellation\nis defined by operational requirements with a refresh rate that requires three\nsatellites--0530,\n0930 and 1330 polar-orbital\ncrossing\ntimes (Fig. RS-19). That notional system will be made\nup of two U.S. satellites, and we are working with\nJohn Morgan of EUMETSAT\nin putting together a\njoint polar system (JPS). With EUMETSAT\'s\ncooperation we look forward to EUMETSAT\nproviding and\nworking with U.S. for the 0930 orbit, providing that\nsatellite. This is an outgrowth of conversations\nthat\nstarted some 10 years ago between NOAA and\nEUMETSAT.\nSo there will be a joint polar system,\n\nSURFACE\n\nTEMPERATURE\n\nDOD\n\nFigure\n\nS\n\nFigure\n\nUSERS\n\ni,+\ni\':\n:\n\n::\n\nE\nE\n\nL\nA\n\nI\n\nI\n\n.\n\nE\n\nD\n\n. :_3 + o _::\'_s:\n\n: ....\n; ....\n\nT\n\n::_+_\n_-_:\n\nM\nE\n\n;:::\n_-;:\n\n"_\n\n\'\n\n!\n\n_"\n\n_\n\n\' _\n\nRS-21\n\nand by the end of the year we hope to have an agreement in place.\nThis next viewgraph on convergence\nsynchronization can take a half hour by itself (Fig. RS-20). The\npoint I want to make on this is really quite simple.\nWe\'re going to fly out the DMSP satellites, we\'re\ngoing to fly out the NOAA satellites, the NOAA N\nand N\'. METOP-1 will then be the partner to the\nNOAA satellite. That\'s where the joint polar program\ncomes from. EUMETSAT\nhopefully will then fly\nMETOP-1 in the 0930 orbit; NOAA will continue to\nfly N and N\'. We will then work to have the first\nNPOESS satellite available by the year 2004 for\nlaunch. In addition, we will build into the program the\noption for data denial in time of war or crises so this\ndoes support a DoD mission.\nNext please (Fig. RS-21). This is a user-driven\nprogram. You see on your left the seven key parameters that drive this program. These are the requirements defined by both NOAA, working with our\ninternational\ncolleagues,\nas well as DoD users. They\'ll\nsupport mission needs, mission plans. We\'ll have a C 3\nsegment and a ground segment which will then go\ndirectly to the users.

Three\nsatellites, the data coming down to a civilian community, an international\ncommunity,\nand an operational\nmilitary community.\nThis satellite system will support\na very broad community of users.\nOne of the things we\'re looking at is an early\nconvergence of the Command and Control segment.\nThis is motivated by DoD\'s decision to close its dedicated DMSP satellite operation.\nRight now we are\nevaluating how we can transition DMSP ground segment control from Air Force into NOAA. Our expectation is that in about two years we will see the operations of DMSP transitioned\ninto NOAA, working side\nby side to do the ground control for DMSP. There\nwill be a DoD backup.\nI mentioned the requirements\nprocess. It\'s a joint\nagency requirements\nprocess driven by the two opera\ntional users, DoD and NOAA. We have defined our\ninitial requirements.\nIn January of this year we issued\nour preliminary\nintegrated operational\ndocument.\nThat\'s what the IPO is working to satisfy, and the\nconcept studies are also working to satisfy those requirements and define the concept against those requirements.\nWe\'ll then refine the requirements\nfurther\nas we go into the Phase I and Phase II and look at\ncost benefits. So it is a requirements\ndriven process.\nOur schedule is indicated on the next viewgraph\n(Fig. RS-23). We are constantly defending to Congress\nwhy it takes 10 years to build a new satellite program,\nwhy it costs so much money, and the like. We keep\ntrying to tell them, like the Fram commercial,\n"Pay\nme now or pay me later." If they really want to do it\nbad, they\'re going to get it bad, so we\'re really adhering to our 10-year development\nprocess. We feel\nvery, very strongly about that. The first satellite available for launch is in the year 2004.\nWe are in the Phase 0 concept studies right now.\nThat will be followed next year by Phase I demonstration/validation,\nand that will be full and open competi-\n\n46\n\nFigure\n\nI\n\ntAU_CH\n\nI\n\nRS-23\n\ntion. We\'ll have two contractors participating\nin the\nPhase I demonstration.\nWe have defined our seven key parameters.\nAlthough we have a long list of other parameters,\nwe\'re\nlooking at all technologies\nto see how we can satisfy\nthose seven key parameters.\nEverything\nwe know\ntoday will be considered in the study, as well as the\napplication of small satellite technology.\nMy personal\nopinion is that I fully expect to see this as a large\nsatellite, but we really are looking at augmentation\nto\nthe program and how small sats can fit into the program. We think it\'s going to be a very important\nadjunct to what we\'re doing, as I believe it\'s an important adjunct to what we\'re doing in our geostationary weather satellites.\nThe two agencies, Defense and Commerce,\nhave\nagreed to a 50-50 cost share. We arrive at that cost\nshare by about the year 2000/2001,\nand the reason for\nthat is where DoD was in its POM process and where\nCommerce\nwas in its budget process. So up front,\nCommerce will spend a little more money, DoD a\nlittle less money; then we\'ll flip-flop as we get to\nabout 1998. The point is that the agencies have agreed\nto this funding profile and that\'s what we\'re working\ntoward.\nAn important element that I would like to add is\nthat we\'re constantly asked on the Hill, why do we\nthink this is going to work? LandSat didn\'t work. The\nreason is that we have two agencies supported by\nanother agency with the technology.\nThe two agencies\nhave a vested interest in ensuring this program works.\nWe need these data.\nAnd finally, the next steps (Fig. RS-24). Fully staff\nour program office. Right now we\'re using a staff of\n"loaners" until we get a program director on board.\nWe\'re in the final stages of a tri-agency Memorandum\nof Agreement.\nIt\'s going to the Secretaries of the\nvarious departments\nfor signature. We\'re finalizing\nour agreement with John Morgan and EUMETSAT.\nAnd we\'re finalizing the concept studies. So this is a\nprogram that\'s up and operating.\nIf you come to our\nbuilding in Silver Spring, Maryland,\nyou will see\n\nREMOTE\n\nworking side by side people from three agencies committed to a program--and\na lot of people thought we\ncouldn\'t make it happen. Thank you.\n\nNEXT\n\nPROFESSOR GABRYNOWICZ: Thank you. I\'d like to\nthank the panel members for very informative presentations.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPROFESSOR GABRYNOWICZ: The first question is for\nthe entire panel. Remote sensing--so\nwhat?! No\nspeaker has given any compelling reason for remote\nsensing. We can count global deforestation,\nyes, but\nhow can that help us? What is the real tangible benefit\nof remote sensing? Who wants to go first?\nMR. WINOKUR."I guess I\'m willing to start because\nI\'ve lived now in two communities.\nI spent most of\nmy career working for the Navy, but now I\'m in the\ncivilian community.\nFrom my personal perspective,\nremote sensing is a critical ingredient for a number of\nactivities, not the least of which is weather. I tried to\nexplain that to a Congressman\nyesterday;\nI\'m not\nsure he understood\nit or not. Clearly some of the\nother examples that you\'ve seen here and work that\nI\'ve done, showing that satellite systems are essential\ningredients for supporting military operations,\nseasurface temperature\n(in the old days when we had a\nSoviet submarine threat in certain parts of the North\nAtlantic we relied heavily on remote sensing to know\nwhere the Gulf Stream is), deforestation,\nLandsat,\ncoastal habitat destruction,\nmonitoring volcanos. I\nthink you can put together a huge list of applications\nof satellite remote sensing.\nSINGHROY."\nI have a number of examples I can\nquote, but I\'ll give you some very brief ones. In about\na week from now I\'ll be in Jordan, and I will be using\nSar imagery to map waddis whereby they can find\nground water. Water is like gold in the desert. You\ncan find geological structures,\nyou can drill them, and\nyou can find water. There\'s a lot of money in that. If\nyou go to any big mining conference, and if you come\nfrom a multinational,\nI had an imagery I didn\'t show,\nbut there\'s an example where American and Canadian\nmultinational\nmining companies are using Sar imagery\nintegrated with LandSat thematic and spot data to find\npaleochannels\nin the Amazon, in the upper areas of\nVenezuela where gold and diamonds are being discovered. It\'s an operational\nexploration tool. I can give\nyou examples where the government of Guyana has\nbeen using it for land cover, for forest inventory.\nRead your literature; you\'ll find a lot of examples\nthere.\nDR.\n\nPROFESSOR GABRYNOWICZ: I might also direct the\nquestioner. The Office of Technology\nAssessment just\ncompleted an extensive three-volume\nset that could be\n\nSign\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nQ&A\n\nFully staff\n\nFinalize\n\ntriagency\n\nFinalize\n\nFigure\n\nEMERGING\n\nERA\n\nSTEPS\n\nProgram\n\nMemorandum\n\nfor Joint\n\nconcept\n\npreparation\nValidation\n\nTHE\n\nOffice\n\nOf Agreement\n\nMemorandumofAgreementwith\n\nEUMETSAT\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIntegrated\n\nSENSING:\n\nfor\n\nPolar\n\nstudies\nMilestone\n\nSystem\n\nand requirements\nI and\n\nin\n\nDemonstration/\n\nPhase\n\nRS-24\n\ncalled, "Everything\nyou wanted to know about remote\nsensing." I encourage you to obtain that. There are\nenormous amounts of information\nin there that will\nhelp you with that question.\nDR. FELSHER: Is there a God? I mean, I think all you\nneed do is pick up any textbook--I\nmean any textbook, in any subject. Agronomy to Zoology, A-Z.\nAnd I think you\'ll find applications\nwithout any trouble at all. Perhaps it\'s even better understood by those\nin developing countries who don\'t have the facilities\nwe have. I spent what I thought would be two days--it\nturned out to be over a week--at the UN sponsored\nmeeting in Triesta several years ago for professors\nteaching geography and resources and all sorts of\nsubjects in developing countries that barely understood\nthe words "remote sensing" but understood the need\nfor it. My brain was sucked dry in seven days of\nabout, I would say, literally 15 to 16 hours a day of\nconstant questioning.\nThere were two Americans\nthere, and we had to take turns breathing.\nI think\nthere\'s no question but we can each of us construct a\nlist of applications\nthat covers any subject you want to\ntalk about.\nI\'m not wearing my commercial\nhat now. That is\nmy industrial hat. Simply as a human activity, satellite\nremote sensing--looking\nat the Earth from space and\napplying that knowledge--is\njust at the beginning.\nI\nthink the applications\nare going to be enormous for\nthe world.\nPROFESSOR GABRYNOWICZ: I would just add one\nword: Perspective.\nYou can see from there; you can\nsee things you simply can\'t see from ground level,\nand that\'s what we need to know about.\nThe next question. Should weather data be wholly\nfree, partially commercial,\nor wholly commercial?\nAnd this is for the panel.\nMR. WINOKUR: From the perspective\nof the United\nStates, the U.S. government\'s\nposition is that weather\ndata is free and open. That\'s a position that we still\n47\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nmaintain today. So in that context, that\'s the U.S.\ngovernment\npolicy up until now. It\'s been a longstanding U.S. policy, and because of international\nactivities that are going on right now, the U.S. government has an Interagency\nTask Force that\'s looking\nat that and is making an assessment.\nBut that assessment will take into account that longstanding\nU.S.\npolicy and tradition of free and open and unrestricted\naccess to U.S. weather data. In the international\ncontext, we\'ll work to maximize the international\nexchange of environmental\ndata.\n\nI firmly believe that the remote sensing will\nhave a long-term\nproduce\n\nbeautiful\n\nfuture.\n\nNot because\n\npictures,\n\nin the benefit of mankind,\nan economic\n\nit can\n\nnot because\nbut because\n\nit is\nit has\n\nbenefit.\n\nMR. MORGAN: Bob mentioned the U.S. policy, and I\nthink what\'s critical to this question is that it must be\nin accordance to the national policy of the countries\nconcerned.\nCertainly within Europe there is a different\nperspective.\nOne of the things I must say is that of all\nthe criteria of access to data, we certainly can endorse\nthe idea in Europe also that everybody should have\naccess to weather data. It\'s a value to the community\nand the best possible use should be made of it. But the\ndata are valuable, and the European perspective is that\nas much as possible should be done to make sure the\nuser pays for the data to make sure that there is a\nfeedback from the user to the technology.\nYou didn\'t give me an opportunity\nto speak about\nthe question, "Why remote sensing?" I firmly believe\nthat the remote sensing will have a long-term future.\nNot because it can produce beautiful pictures, not\nbecause it is in the benefit of mankind, but because it\nhas an economic benefit. And that economic benefit\nhas to feed through from the operational\nusers of the\ndata right through to the data producers.\nAnd we want\nto produce a mechanism\nwhereby real costs fall on\nreal users.\n\nback we got from the companies that attended the\nmeeting in January, believe it or not, the Number One\nwas education and outreach. And I got the same feeling here this morning. To get the word out in other\nwords. So we\'re not looking at this as a major thrust\ntoward the legislature, although that is one.\nIn terms of financing it, this is going to be structured as a 501(c)(3). We have put together a rate\nschedule for companies. I can tell you what that is\nnow if you\'d care to hear it; actually, it\'s quite a list.\nBut basically, for the remote sensing industry, that is,\nfor companies in the private sector or those parts of\ncompanies dealing with the remote sensing activities,\nwe have three scales. From less than $1 million in\nannual revenue, between $1 and $10 million, and over\n$10 million. Membership\n$1,000, $3,000 and $5,000.\nBut we expect to make a major thrust into the enduser community,\nand we will have associate memberships from agencies and such where the annual memberships will be $100.\nThe questioner is absolutely correct. If we cannot\nget sufficient funding to do this, there will be no\norganization.\nMy plea for membership\nis a real one.\nAs for myself, and I point this out as I did at the\nGoddard Symposium when I gave a similar talk two\nor three weeks ago, that because of the various things\nI do, I will be putting this together with an Executive\nCommittee and we will be looking for an Executive\nDirector so I can go out and do the things I regularly\ndo.\nIs Dave Johnson here in the audience? David is\nwith CTA, and he\'s one of the three members on our\nExecutive Committee.\nYou will see him at the CTA\nbooth, and if you have additional questions on\nNARSIA for the next several days, talk to him. I\nserve on a Defense Science Board committee and I\nhave to be back in Washington\ntomorrow,\nso I won\'t\nbe around after this talk.\nPROFESSOR GABRYNOWICZ: Have you invited\ndemics and federal employees yet?\n\nHow will NARSIA\n\nbe financed\n\naca-\n\nat a sufficiently\n\nhigh level to do a good job? How do you\n\nPROFESSOR GABRYNOW1CZ: The next question is for\nMurray. How will NARSIA be financed at a sufficiently high level to do a good job? How do you think\nthat you will reach the real users of the data from\nWashington,\nespecially when your thrust is legislative?\n\nthink that you will reach the real users of the\n\nDR. FELSHER: First of all, the thrusts are not legislative. There were four thrusts mentioned in my paper\nand perhaps when you get to read the whole thing\nyou\'ll understand\nit really is four. This is not a lobbying organization\nper se. We certainly don\'t expect it\nwill take that as a major thrust. In fact, of the feed-\n\nDR. FEKSHER: Yes. I didn\'t mean to cast any aspersions on you, Joanne. You will recall that I am an exprofessor. Our initial reaction was that no, we don\'t\nwant people like feds and professors,\nJoarme, but the\nargument was presented and accepted that we don\'t\nwant to exclude anybody. There is a class of mem-\n\n48\n\ndata from Washington,\nthrust\n\nespecially\n\nwhen your\n\nis legislative?\n\nREMOTE\n\nbership--associate\nmembership--for\nthe acadeems,\ndefinitely.\nI mentioned Dave Johnson. Also, General Vivisek\nat Autometric\nand Nicky Trishell at ERM. The four of\nus are putting the thing together. The other three are\nthe executive committee,\nand I\'m acting as the director.\nGABRYNOWlCZ:\nAgain, a question for the\npanel. Space News recently reported that the remote\nsensing market will grow by an order of magnitude\nfrom $800 million to $8 billion by the end of the\ndecade. Does the panel agree with this projection?\nPROFESSOR\n\nMR. WINOKUR: Let me quickly say, the numbers\nhave been coming out from everywhere and as diverse\nas Space News or from your corner drugstore. The\ntruth of the matter is that nobody really knows, because nobody has really defined the market. I say this\nas a consultant that has been paid very well to define\nthe market. Given the choice, my own druthers would\nbe at the higher end. But when I did the Kodak study\nfor NOAA back in \'88, we predicted $2% billion by\nthe end of the century, and we were told we were\noverly optimistic.\nAnd I think, frankly, we were overly pessimistic.\nDR. SINGHROY: I think nobody really knows. The\nremote sensing industry should be part of the information industry; that is, I mentioned the word GIS, for\nU.S. to make this data very useful. Again, it\'s more\nthan a pretty picture. Again, it has to be integrated\nwith a localized system. It has to be integrated with\ndigital terrain data. It has to be integrated with land\ncover information,\nwhat is known in a country. So\nthese are some of the actual bottlenecks for that\ngrowth area. And as these two industries, the digital\nmapping industry and the imaging industry, move\ntogether, one creates a critical mass for the other. So,\nyes there is growth but one obviously depends on the\nother.\nPROFESSOR GABRYNOWICZ."I\'ll add to that. I think\nit\'s going to be very important. I look at that question\nand I say, "What do you mean7 Does that include\nsatellite manufacture\nand building? Is that only the\ndata? Is that the ground stations? Is that the programs?\nAre those the computers?\nWhat do you mean when\nyou talk about remote sensing industry?"\nI think one\nof the difficulties the community has had is, we have\nnot done enough discriminating in terms of answering\nthat question. The two things that you hear over and\nover again, at least since the failed commercialization\nof the LandSat system in 1984, is commercialization\nis\nkind of monolithic.\nThere\'s no distinction between\nthose activities. And data is monolithic without a\ndistinction as to what data does what for whom and\nwhy. And I think to be commercially\nsuccessful, you\nhave to make those distinctions and make your busi-\n\nSENSING:\n\nTHE\n\nEMERGING\n\nERA\n\nness plans based on that. It\'s my personal opinion that\nif you really want to make money, you should be\ngoing into the value added, the GIS, the ground-based\napplications of the data. So you need to be discriminating about that.\nActually, the next one is for me. Do you foresee\nthe United States government\nwithdrawing\nthe licenses\nalready given for commercial\nremote sensing to one\nmeter resolution due to security or other reasons?\nI don\'t know what the government\'s\ngoing to do\nany more than anybody else in this room, but I will\nsay that the foundation for those licenses are in an\nactive Congress. The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act\nof 1992 provides and gives the President the authorization to declassify hardware and software for commercial purposes. The Clinton Administration\nPolicy\nis an extension of that statutory permission,\nand there\nare forces in Congress, most notably by Congressperson Bingamon, who would have that policy\nchanged. And I would just remind people that it has a\nstatutory foundation and the law would have to be\nchanged as well as the policy. From a commercial\npoint of view, that\'s the good news. The bad news is\nthe law also required NASA and DoD to work together in a joint program to operate LandSat, and they\ndecided that Act of Congress notwithstanding\nthat was\nnot going to be the case. So sometimes the statute is\nlistened to and sometimes the statute is not. So that\nwould be my answer to that question.\nDr. Singhroy, can you cite success stories where\nyour Center\'s work has provided data that was used\neffectively?\nDR. SINGHROY: I\'ll take the Jordan case. Ground\nwater, managing water in deserts. We have used Sar,\nagain to map like the veins of the desert. All the dry\nchannels, because that\'s where water flowed. The\ninteresting thing about this, they use a term called\nwater harvesting.\nHow you do that is basically you\nblock your streams and your water percolates\nin the\nexisting aquafiers so you have the water in there and\nyou can tap it later on. You can use a number of\nremote sensing techniques,\nboth LandSat as well as\nSar imagery for that. That\'s one very good successful\nstory.\nThere are a number of success case studies.\nAgain, I don\'t want to harp on the mining business,\nbut the whole mining technology,\nparticularly\nas a\nresult of the open up of developing countries to get\nnew currency. They open up their resources and you\nhave new tracks of land for mineral exploration.\nThere are a lot of examples where multinational\nmining companies are using this data; it\'s not only for the\nCenter\'s point of view.\nA case in Brazil. We are looking at not only forest depletion, but also water shed mapping. A part\nfrom looking at the way you cut the forests and monitor that, is what are the erosions and so forth that are\ngoing on as related environmental.\nCoastal zone map49\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nping, you\'re monitoring\nnot only on the water side but\nthe erosion side. Lots of examples.\nGABRYNOWlCZ:\nNext question is for\nBob. Is there a date when the Program Director will\nbe named?\nPROFESSOR\n\nMR. WINOKUR: I guess the only thing I can say at\nthis point is we have indeed made an offer to an individual. I can\'t name that individual at this point since\nthere are some bureaucratic\nhoops that we have to\njump through. I\'m hoping by the end of April, for my\nown personal health and well-being. As part of the\nhoops we have to jump through, we also have to have\nthe Executive Committee approve the individual. So I\nthink we\'re within weeks.\n\nEven if NOAA were, in some way, to be\ndisestablished,\n\nthere are clear functions\n\nhave to be continued.\nare statutory\nCongress\n\nfunctions\n\nthat\n\nSome of them clearly\nso, Congress\n\ngives,\n\ncan take away, but somebody\n\nhas\n\nto change a number of laws first.\n\nGABRYNOWICZ:\nNext question is for\nJohn. Did I understand there is no approved funding\nfor the METOP series, and what is the current status\nof agreements, MOUs, with the United States?\nPROFESSOR\n\nMR. MORGAN: There is funding for the METOP\nseries, but only the initial start-up studies. We have\nabout $40 million worth of funding in hand in\nEUMETSAT,\nslightly higher than that within our\npartner agency, the European Space Agency, for the\ninitial studies. And we are at the moment in the situation of seeking funds for the remaining program, that\nis, the construction\nof the satellites and their launch\nand operations.\nThat by our standards is a lot of\nmoney. We\'re talking about 1.5 million ECUs (European Currency Units, you might not be familiar with;\nit\'s quoted in the Wall Street Journal so you can do\nthe calculation).\nBut it\'s pretty nearly $2 billion we\nneed for this whole operation. We have to sign up 17\ncountries to that. We hope the process can be completed this year.\nAs far as the agreement with NOAA is concerned,\nwe still have discussions with NOAA in progress\nliterally today, and most of the open issues between us\nare solved. We are talking about an agreement which\nwill cover the so-called Initial Joint Polar System,\ncovering the first two satellites on each side, and\nwe\'re hopeful for a signature of that before the end of\nthis year.\n\n50\n\nPROFESSOR GABRYNOWlCZ: Recent news accounts\nreport a proposed severe cutback or even the elimination of NOAA, and dare I say I heard that news report on NPR, I suppose. Is private industry ready to\ntake that role, and Mr. Morgan, if NOAA were eliminated, how would that affect relations between the\nUnited States and Europe?\nWINOKUR:\nI guess we hear the rumors too, but I\nthink any announcement on the death of NOAA or the\nDepartment of Commerce certainly is premature. We\nwere on the Hill yesterday defending our budget in\nfront of the House Appropriations Committee, and we\nget to do it again tomorrow in the Senate. Certainly\nnobody in the budget hearing we had yesterday said\nNOAA was going away. They did say perhaps we had\ntoo much money in our budget and we needed to cut\nback. So I don\'t think so at this point, at least I\'m not\npersonally prepared to take seriously the demise of\nNOAA. Even if NOAA were, in some way, to be\ndisestablished,\nthere are clear functions that have to be\ncontinued. Some of them clearly are statutory functions so, Congress gives, Congress can take away, but\nsomebody has to change a number of laws first.\nI think the real issue is going to be a budgetary\none, not NOAA disappearing\nfrom the horizon.\nMR.\n\nMR. MORGAN: How will it affect relations? There are\ntwo scenarios. Either the work continues with another\nlead agency and we would cooperate with that lead\nagency. If the work didn\'t continue, I think that\'s a\nvery unlikely scenario, but even so, we would follow\ncertainly the ideas expressed earlier this morning\nwhen we were in the vision part of the discussion,\nwhen essentially it was said, a nation\'s got to do what\na nation\'s got to do. We will decide what observational data we need, and we will build satellites to suit\nthat and we will fly them. I won\'t say that what happens in the United States is immaterial to what we do,\nwe would like to have a cooperative\nendeavor to make\nit more efficient and to save costs on our side. But\nwe\'re going to go ahead regardless.\nMR. WINOKUR: Let me just quickly add, I think most\nof U.S. had at one time or other have had a little note\non our board that says, "When in doubt--reorganize,"\nand I think that there\'s some permanence\nestablished\nin one\'s mind to a government\ninstitution. But you\nhave to remember that before President Nixon did his\nExecutive Order #3 in 1970, there was no such thing\nas NOAA nor EPA for that matter. The functions can\nalways continue elsewhere.\nBy the way, I haven\'t heard a single industrial\ncomponent that said they would like to take over any\npart of NOAA ever, except for that small chunk at\nComSat that wanted the MetSats back in the early\n\'80s. But that\'s a whole different story, and I don\'t\nthink there\'s any danger there.\n\nREMOTE\n\nBut in termsof NOAA disappearing as an organization, they\'re talking about doing away with HHS,\nand they\'re talking about doing away with the Geological Survey. When I say "they," I mean the government. I don\'t frankly think there\'s anything holy about\nany specific agency or part of an agency. Anything\ncan happen, quite literally.\nPROFESSOR GABRYNOWICZ: One quick final question.\nWhat is the proper relationship\nbetween the public and\nthe private sector in remote sensing?\nMR. WINOKUR:\nand SPOT, hand\nthe private sector\nin hand. There\'s\n\nSpeaking in the second row, EOSAT\nin hand. If they can sit together, then\nand the government\ncan work hand\nno question about it.\n\nMR. MORGAN: I certainly agree that cooperation\nis\nneeded and that, for the foreseeable future, both sectors will co-exist. They must. But there must be a\nclear understanding\nthat eventually people will ask,\n"Why is government\nin this particular business? Not\nin the business as a whole, but in certain elements of\nthe business?"\nI think it must be clear eventually that\nit cannot be continued where every part of the service\nis subsidized through taxpayers\'\nmoney on a general\ngovernment\nlevel. It must be, in some cases, done on\na fully commercial\nbasis where the commercial\nentities\neventually have to pay for the satellites. Otherwise\nwe\'re fooling ourselves.\nWe had the mention of applications.\nThere are\nvolumes of applications\nof remote sensing. They\'re\nsuper things--I don\'t want to decry that. But until the\nend user has to pay for the satellite as such, and\ndoesn\'t get the data at rate-subsidized\nfees, you cannot\ncompare it really with aircraft measurements\nof the\nsame item. If you ask somebody in Jordan, "Would\nyou prefer to have aircraft measurements\nor satellite\nmeasurements?"\nI don\'t suppose he would care very\nmuch where it comes from. He would ask, "What\'s\ncheapest?" And he would take the satellite data if it\nwas subsidized and cheap. But if the full cost was put\ntogether, he would have a proper choice.\nAnd we see that from meteorology.\nThe meteorologists that pay for our systems really have to make a\nhard decision. They ask, do we want to pay for a\n\nTHE\n\nEMERGING\n\nERA\n\nsatellite observing the total scene which is very valuable (they certainly admit that), or can we instead\nspend the same amount of money on a ground-based\nsystem? And that\'s the choice they\'re making, and\nthey choose satellites because they\'re cost effective.\nSo I think in the end the users have got to recognize the full cost of the individual elements they\'re\npaying for, but it will mean many years before that\nhappens in most cases, and the government,\nI think,\nhas a duty to start the system going and to provide\nseed corn for the system, probably for the next couple\nof decades or more. But there should be a trend toward commercialization.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2..\nDR. FELSHER: I certainly would second that. Cooperation is essential. I think there are certain services we\nwould view as essential government\nservices. On the\nother hand, I think we have to work hand-in-glove\nwith the private sector, the value-added part of the\nprivate sector. The private sector that provides the\nsatellites, the ground segments, and the like. I think\nwe really do need to work hand-in-glove\nand cooperation is a key part of it. Then there\'s also a customer\nrelationship\nas well. So I think there are numerous\nrelationships.\nPerhaps they\'ll change a little bit, but I\ndon\'t think you\'ll see marked changes.\n\nSENSING:\n\nit\'s useful to think of remote sensing\n\nactivities\n\nlike a web. Everything\n\nto everything\nhardware,\n\nit appears.\n\nthe software\n\nis connected\n\nThe data to the\n\nto the hardware,\n\nthe\n\npublic to the private, the user to the\nproducer\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPROFESSOR GABRYNOWICZ: Before we thank our\npanelists, I\'d just like to close with my remark, which\nis, this has been terrific. And one thing that the conversation has demonstrated\nis that, I think it\'s useful\nto think of remote sensing activities like a web. Everything is connected to everything\nit appears. The\ndata to the hardware, the software to the hardware,\nthe public to the private, the user to the producer.\nAnd it really invites us to do two things, and that is to\nhave a dialogue among the different participants\nin the\nremote sensing community.\nTo be frank, there\'s been\nsevere adversarialism\nbetween users and providers,\nacademics and government,\npublic and private. And I\nthink that adversarialism--I\'m\nnot talking about\nhealthy competition,\nI\'m talking about adversarialism--is\nnot healthy for remote sensing activities.\nAnd the second thing I would encourage us to do\nis to continue this dialogue whenever and wherever\nyou have the chance to do so. On behalf of the panel,\nwe\'ll always be glad to talk to you about that.\nI\'d like to thank the panel, especially John for\ncoming all the way from Europe just for this particular thing. I asked him if he had other work that he\nwas putting together here to make the trip worthwhile\nand he said, "Nope, this is why I came." So I would\nlike to thank everybody for coming and donating their\ntime and giving us what I believe to be a very enlightening conversation.\nThank you.\nMR. PAYNE: Thank you to the session speakers and to\nProfessor Gabrynowicz\nfor chairing such an outstanding session on remote sensing.\n\n51\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nThere\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nAre Opportunities\n\nin Space!\n\nPanel\nModerator:\n\nDr. Peter Swan\nManager of Business Development\nMotorola Satellite Communications\nDivision\n\nSpeakers:\n\nWilliam R.

SWAN: Thank you, Dave. I\'m really excited to be\nhere today because the topic of the Symposium--which\nis Vision and Reality--and\nthe topic of this session are\n\n52\n\nLLC\n\n& COO\n\nMR. PAYNE: We had an excellent morning, talking\nabout visions, positioning ourselves for those visions,\nand discussing remote sensing in terms of opportunities. This next session will examine some of the other\nopportunities\nof space, and it will be chaired by Dr.\nPeter Swan.\n\nThere are opportunities\n\nDr. Francis X. Kane\nPresident\nGPS International\nAssociation\n\ntimely for my business as well as for me personally--the timing is just about right for my personal\ncareer.\nVision and Reality--that\'s\nexactly where we are in\nIRIDIUM \xc2\xae. We have come up with a vision that is to\nprovide a cellular-like\nphone any place, any time, for\nanyone. It is a total vision that encompasses the globe.\nThe reality is that we\'re within 500 days of launch.\nEveryone in this room knows what that means. The\nschedule is starting to become paramount.\nI was over at the exhibits next door and picked up\nAviation Week, and it\'s timely in terms of IRIDIUM \xc2\xae.\nIt has an article entitled "Iridium on Track for First\nLaunch in \'96" and a sidebar entitled "New Technologies Allow 22-day Satellite Assembly."\nIn fact,\nthe IRIDIUM \xc2\xae team is changing the way space is\nconducted. Instead of 18 to 36 months of assembly and\ntesting, we\'re going to do it in less than 22 days.\nThis is the vision: Any place, any time. The reality is: Launch is coming up fast.\nBut first, let\'s talk about the panel. There are\nopportunities\nin space. In my mind, this means there is\nmoney available for viable business projects. The\ntechnological\nadvances over the last 40 years have\nencouraged investment in this arena of commercial\nspace businesses.\nEach panelist is here to discuss some\naspect of that topic. Just recently, I was reading an\narticle by Theresa Foley entitled "Satellite Financing\nor How to Raise Funds for a Risky Business."\nIt still\nis risky. Rockets still blow up. We hopefully are going\nto put up 100 satellites, and that means there are going\nto be a lot of opportunities.\nGoing through that article, I noticed that there was\na list of financing over the last few years. Just a few\nof these are $440 million in \'92 for PanAmSat, $335\nmillion in \'94 for EchoStar, $1.6 billion in \'93-94 for\nIRIDIUM \xc2\xae, $1.4 billion in \'94 for InMarSat-P,\n$180\nmillion in \'94 for Odessy, $294 million in equity funding for Global Star, $200 million in public offering for\n\nTHERE\n\nGlobal Star, $157 million over a period of time in\npublic funding for Orbital Sciences Corporation.\nThe\nmoney is there; thus, the opportunities\nare there.\nWhile there\'s no up and down in space, the ups\nand downs of the business world drive the opportunities for space ventures. Let me just show you\none approach in financing (Fig. 0S-1).\nThis shows the flags and the titles for all the investors for the $1.6 billion for IRIDIUM*.\nIt\'s a consortium that was formed, then provided $800 million in\nJuly \'93 and another $800 million in September\n\'94.\nThe next chart shows the global reach of the telecommunications\ncompanies around the world that invested\nin this business. The real key is that the opportunities\nare there, and there are many of us pursuing them.\nThe excitement is growing, and the financing is becoming real. Now we have to face reality.\nThis distinguished\npanel has a cross-disciplinary\ntexture to it with expertise in launch vehicles, communication systems, navigation,\nearth resources,\nand\nsome expertise on the Washington\nscene and entrepreneurial financing. I will introduce each panel member.\nHe will then present his talk. We will hold the questions until the end. We\'ll have a good 20 to 30 minutes of questions at the end of the period.\nThe first speaker is Bill Claybaugh.\nHe is the\nbusiness manager for NASA\'s reusable launch vehicle\nprogram. He is responsible for the development\nof\ngovernment-industry\nbusiness arrangements\nfocused on\nimproving the economics of the space transportation\nindustry. He recently was a special assistant for commercial programs to the associate administrator\nfor\nAdvanced Concepts and Technology,\nwhere he was\ninvolved intimately with the X-34 program. Mr.\nClaybaugh holds dual degrees from California State\nUniversity Dominguez\nHills in history and Asian studies and a master\'s in management\nfrom Yale University. Let us welcome Mr. Claybaugh.\nMR. CLAYBAUGH: Thank you, Peter. Jack Mansfield\noffers his apologies. He did want to make it here\ntoday. As I gather you know from France C6rdova\'s\ntalk last night, everyone was on the Hill this morning.\nJack will be coming in tomorrow.\nThis presentation\nwas originally called "Bull-ish\nabout Space," but I kept mispronouncing\nit.\nWe\'re going to look at three general areas. Those\nbroadly breaking into effects from space, things that\nare in space, and getting to space.\nMy colleagues in the remote sensing and space\ncommunications\ndivision offered me this slide (slides\nnot available). As a former venture capitalist, I have a\ncouple of comments,\nmost notably with factor of 10\nincreases in market projections.\nEither this is a remarkable business opportunity,\nor they\'ve gotten hold\nof some of that stuff that the senior managers at\nNASA use all the time. In any case, I would particularly like to note the hyperspectral\nbusiness where\nthere is, in my judgment and in the judgment of my\n\nARE\n\nOPPORTUNITES\n\nIN\n\nSPACE!\n\nIRIDIUM" INVESTORS\n\nFigure\n\nOS-1\n\ncolleagues,\na tremendous\nopportunity to build very\nsmall spacecraft that can image across essentially the\nentire visible and infrared spectrum, allowing users to\nchoose the band or bands that they wish to downlink.\nThe communications\nindustry speaks for itself.\nPeter\'s list of investment to date is certainly indicative\nof the kind of expansion that is likely to occur in that\nindustry over the next few years.\nThe Space Processing Division has, for a decade\nand some change now, been looking at trying to figure\nout how to take advantage of the unique properties of\nthe space environment\nother than the altitude. In that\nregard, it has done a lot of work, sponsored a lot of\nindustrial work, and sponsored a lot of joint work with\nindustry on manufacturing\nin low gravity. Probably the\nmost germane thing that we can say about that is after\na decade and a half of offering space travel for free,\nbecause the defacto price of space travel for research\nand materials processing\nis zero, we have--as\na friend\nof mine calls it--bupkus\nso far, which probably reflects the fact that it\'s a hard problem.\nI would like you to all think a little more about\nanother opportunity--that\nis, making use of the high\nvacuum in space. Because of leakage of hydrogen\nthrough chamber walls, there is a fundamental\nlimit to\nthe level of vacuum that can be reached on the Earth\'s\nsurface. The Wake Shield facility can do two orders of\nmagnitude better than that level. And again, recognizing the fact that sponsored research with NASA involves paying nothing for the cost of space travel,\nthere are, one would suspect, tremendous\nopportunities\nthat may, may, come out of the Wake Shield facility.\nI want to talk a little about an area that I suspect\neveryone in this room has finally recognized is the\ncore problem. It\'s the price of space travel. This chart\nis a map, if you will, of the price elasticity for space\ntransportation.\nIt was developed by the Commercial\nSpace Transportation\nStudy team, a joint NASA-industry group that surveyed across the board and is, I\nbelieve, widely regarded as the best effort to date to\nunderstand the effects of price cuts on demand for\nspace travel.\n53\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nFigure\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\n0S-2\n\nYou will note three curves. The bottom-most\ncurve, the most conservative\none, assumes that under\never-decreasing\nprices--as\nyou can see it goes all the\nway down to $100 per pound placed in earth\norbit--nothing\nchanges. All that happens is we keep\ndoing exactly the same businesses that we are doing\ntoday. As you can see, those businesses grow some.\nThe high curve assumes that everything that anyone could ever conceive of gets done. The middle\ncurve, which is the one I want to focus on, is a curve\nthat was put together using the judgment of the team\nmembers--and\nI want to emphasize this was a very\nlarge group of people representing\nall the major aerospace companies. The consensus developed was that\nthere were at least two opportunities\nunder decreasing\nprice that made economic sense.\nThat bottom curve shows, as you will note at\naround $600-700 a pound, a break in the curve. That\nopportunity--and\nI will ask that we reserve the giggle\nfactor on this one--that\nopportunity\nis the business of\ndisposing of nuclear waste. It turns out, after a thorough economic analysis, that everyone makes money\nat around $600-700 a pound getting rid of the 4 percent of waste after processing\nwhich needs to be permanently disposed of. The utilities make money, the\nprocessors make money, the transportation\ncompany\nmakes money, the people who are in the business of\nplacing it in solar orbit or on the far side of the moon\nmake money. That is the first major new market opportunity identified by this study. Setting aside the\npolitical issues, it looks like a way to make money/f\nthe cost of space travel drops below $600 a pound.\nYou will note that the curve then continues to go up in\nan approximately\nexponential fashion.\n\n54\n\nThe delta above the straight line in that curve is\nthe beginning of space tourism which, on the basis of\nthis study, it was concluded would start at around\n$400 a pound and become a very major industry at\naround $100 a pound. Please note the tonnages on the\nY-axis on that graph. We are talking about levels of\nusage of space that are orders of magnitude greater\nthan what we are doing today.\nThis is what we\'re doing about that problem.\nThese are a series of concepts, whose vehicle designs\nare changing very rapidly. The first is a Rockwell\nconcept for a reusable launch vehicle.\nThe next one is the current McDonnell Douglas\ndesign, then a somewhat earlier version of the\nLockheed design. And finally, the X-34 in its current\ndesign. I want to emphasize that all of these vehicles\nare changing very rapidly and that they are X-vehicles.\nWe are not building at this time low-cost space transportation systems. We are building systems to prove\nthe technology to allow us to build low-cost space\ntransportation\nsystems at some point in the future.\nThose systems are the X-34 and, hopefully in a couple\nof years, the X-33. Thank you.\n\nWe are not building at this time low-cost\nspace transportation\nbuilding systems\n\nsystems.\n\nto prove the technology\n\nallow us to build low-cost\nportation\n\nsystems\n\nWe are\nto\n\nspace trans-\n\nat some point in the future.\n\nDR. SWAN: Thank you, Bill. Our next speaker is Ted\nNanz, who is the president of SPOT Image Corporation. He became the president in 1990. Prior to joining\nSPOT Image, Mr. Nanz served as president of\nDynaTech Communications,\na data communications\ncompany; president and CEO of Coherent Communications Systems, in networking.\nHe has a lot of experience in this area and also has been with Motorola for\n10 years.\nHe has a bachelor of science in electrical engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy, but luckily\nwe have two West Pointers on the panel to counter\nthat. He has a master of business administration\nfrom\nFlorida Atlantic University,\nBoca Raton, Florida, and\nhe\'s a certified quality engineer. Let\'s welcome Mr.\nNanz.\nMR. NANz: Had they told me I\'d be surrounded\nby\ntwo West Point guys, I would have had second\nthoughts. But I\'m here, and it\'s good to be here.\nVision and Reality: Face to Face. What is the\nVision? The vision comes from the answer to people\nwho ask me who our customers and potential customers are.

The reality is that this is hard,\nhard work. There are Opportunities\nin Space! What\nare the Forecasts? Space forecasts? Spacey Forecasts?\nSpaced-Out Forecasts?!!\nIt is a pleasure to see so many professional colleagues and personal friends at this symposium.\nI\nrealize that the audience here is quite mixed among\nmilitary, government,\nand commercial.\nSo I\'m going\nto start with the early users, the military, move on to\nremote sensing, GIS, and the industry that we\'re all\nabout, the government,\nand wind up with the commercial users who, in my opinion, are the people who\nare going to make or break remote sensing, GIS, and\nthe industry that we\'re all about.\nThis first slide is a three-dimensional\nSPOT image\nof Colorado Springs. I have brought with me prints of\nthis image that I will make available to anybody who\n\nwould like one at the end of this panel (Fig. 0S-2).\nIt\'s kind of interesting to see the airport in the foreground, the mountain range in the background,\nand the\ncity in the middle depicted by the blue/grey characteristics.\nAs most of you know, the satellite sees\nvegetation red rather than green, so going up into the\nmountains and to Pike\'s Peak in the background,\nyou\nwill note the red from the vegetation on the hills.\nSo, what is the first question the President or the\nCommander\nasks? During the Cold War it was\n"Where are the carriers?" During the "90s it is "What\nimagery do we have? What information\ndo we have?"\nI will be discussing aspects of satellite remote sensing\nwith you this afternoon, but first I would like you to\nparticipate with me in taking a brief journey through\nhistory (Fig. 0S-3).\nNow back to the issue of the symposium--"Vision\n& Reality: Face to Face." In a recent issue of SpaceWatch, a corporate executive was quoted as saying,\n55\n\n11TH NATIONAL SPACE SYI_PO._IUM\n\nFigure\n\n0S-4\n\nFigure\n\n0S-6\n,\n\n/\n\nJ\n!\'\n\nSPOT!\nSPOI?\nSPOT3\nSPOT4\nSPOT5\nSPOT6\n\n1986\nFigure\n\n0S-5\n\n"Build it and they will come." I couldn\'t disagree\nmore. I am here to tell you that even with great vision, the reality is hard, hard work. Great riches are\nnot automatic.\nThis slide shows medieval armies going to war\nwith swords, bows, and arrows (Fig. 0S-4). Behind\nthe commander\'s\ntent is a salesman attempting to sell a\nmachine gun. The commander\nis saying, "No, I don\'t\nhave time to talk with some crazy salesman, we have a\nbattle to fight." This is obviously a light touch cartoon; however, it says volumes about the impediments,\nhurdles, and difficulties that this industry--satellite\nremote sensing--has\nand maybe some of the other\nspace imagery has in growing markets--not\nonly in the\nobvious military and environmental\napplications,\nbut\nalso in emerging commercial\napplications.\nI flew to Colorado Springs on Monday night after\nhaving attended a major commercial\nsymposium\nin\n56\n\nFigure\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n05-7\n\nChicago entitled "Business Geographies."\nWhile our\nindustry\'s vision is great, the reality is that few people\nknow about information from space and even fewer\nhave yet embodied its us_. It is apparent to me that\nwhat we in this industry* la_ to do can be stated by\nparaphrasing\na United St_e,s President:\n"Ask not what\nspace can do for you, ra_er ask what you can do for\nspace." Too many times i hoar people say, if the government would do that, or if industry would do that,\nor if somebody else would do whatever. Again, "Ask\nnot what space can do for you, ask what you can do\nfor space."\nThis slide is a photo of a SPOT satellite (Fig. 0S5). With workmen alongside it, it helps you appreciate\nthe size of one of these satellites.\nThis slide is of the night launch of SPOT 3 in\nSeptember\n1993 (Fig. 0S-6). It\'s interesting to note\nthat while our product is spatial information,\nthe tech-\n\nTHERE\n\nARE\n\nOPPORTUNITES\n\nIN SPACE!\n\nDATA COLLECTION\nAND ARCHMNG\n\n,POTreceivingstationnetwork.\nFigure 0S-8\n\nFigure 0S-10\n\nFigure 0S-9\n\nFigure 0S-11\n\nnology to get it not only includes the sensors on the\nsatellite, but also the designing and building of the\nsatellite, as well as its launch and the satellite\ncommunications\ninvolved, both in uploading programming and downloading\ninformation.\nContinuity is a big question in the industry. Some\nof the overheads this morning showed tentative plans,\nyet-to-be budgeted satellites. This is a real brief overhead showing SPOT 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 into the next\ndecade, century, and millennium\n(Fig. 0S-7).\nThis slide conveys worldwide receiving stations,\nso that you can appreciate that the satellite imagery\ncan be downloaded from the satellite almost any place\nin the world, as well as being stored on recorders\n(Fig. 0S-8). At lunch today we heard a gentleman\nsaying that he\'s only using one receiving station to get\nall of the satellite data. That may be right, or it may\nnot be right, for that company; I\'m not in any position\nto say. But I\'ve got to tell you that based on my experience, having a network of receiving stations circling the globe like this is very, very valuable, and I\nwouldn\'t give this up for all the tea in China.\nThis slide is of Normandy (Wouldn\'t General\nEisenhower\nhave liked to have had something like\nthis!) (Fig-OS-9)\n\nThese next two slides are among my favorites.\nThis first one is of Baghdad with bridges, and this\nsecond one is Baghdad without bridges (Fig. OS-IOH).\nFor several years we have been selling Russian\nsynthetic aperture and high resolution satellite imagery, and there\'s a big international\nimplication to this\nbusiness that we\'ve only heard a little bit about so far\nduring this symposium\n(Fig. 0S-12). This slide is an\ninteresting shot of the Kremlin taken in December\n1991 during negotiations\nwith the then Soviets, depicting the only time in history that two different flags\nsimultaneously\nflew over the Kremlin--the\nSoviet\nhammer and sickle on the right and the Russian horizontal white, blue, and red on the left.\nThis slide depicts some of the reality in achieving\nthe vision (Fig. 0S-13). It talks about making things\nvaluable. The left column shows carbon being made\ninto diamonds, then into jewelry. Carbon has little\nvalue, diamonds have some value, but jewelry has a\nlot of value. The second column shows silicon being\nmade into semiconductor\nwafers, then into integrated\ncircuits. Integrated circuits, as you will appreciate,\nhave great value; sand has very little. The third column addresses our challenges, turning raw satellite\n57\n\n11TH NATIONAL\n\nFigure\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\n0S-12\n\nFigure\n\nFigure\n\n0S-14\n\n0S-13\n\ndata into processed imagery, then into attributed spatial information.\nThe raw data has little value to most\nusers; spatial information\nhas great value. One of\nindustries\' challenges is to develop products that better\ncorrespond\nwith the final element in each of these\nthree progressions.\nSeveral articles in recent publications,\nincluding\nSpace News, talk about convergence\nof technologies\nto\npropel market growth. During the slide of the rocket\nlaunch of SPOT 3, I talked about satellite communications technology for upioading programming\nand\ndownloading\ninformation.\nMore and more related\nproducts and services depend upon the inclusion of\nGPS technology,\nas well as ground processing and\ndistribution.\nAnother analogy has to do with the development of the personal computer industry in the\n1980s. This development\ncame on the heels of the\nconvergence\nof many things--specifically\nhardware,\nsoftware, and distribution.\nThis slide is for my GPS friends (Fig. 0S-14). It\nshows a large ship going aground in the harbor with\npeople on the pier stating, "He said he was using the\nglobal positioning system to navigate the channel when\nthe DoD turned on the selective availability degrader!"\n\n58\n\nFigure\n\n08-15\n\nShowing that we can poke fun at ourselves, the\nnext slide is of the cartoon character Hagar. It shows\nHagar and his friend knee deep in water holding maps,\nand Hagar stating, "When you made this map, why\ndidn\'t you indicate this area was water?"\n"I ran out of\nblue crayons!" was the answer (Fig. 0S-15). This gets\nback to my slide a moment ago about the fact that raw\ndata is of very little use to people, and that special\ninformation\nis of great use.\nAn exciting new development\nis an Air Force\nproject called Eagle Vision, as depicted in the next\nslide, which is a transportable\nsatellite imagery receiving station now located at USAF European headquarters at Ramstein Air Base. It can be transported\nany place in the world and set up to receive imagery\nwithin 24 hours (Fig. 0S-16). Much credit to this goes\nto Air Force Lt. Col. "Snake" Clark. This was developed after the Gulf War, based on the need to send\n\nTHERE\n\nFigure\n\n0S-16\n\n"imagery to the shooter" much faster. For anybody\nwho is interested in the tremendously\nsuccessful usage\nof satellite imagery during Desert Storm, I recommend\nyou read an "after action" report authored by Air\nForce Captain--now\nMajor--Jim\nJeffries, an F-111\npilot who was instrumental\nin getting satellite imagery\nto the coalition forces and who is now stationed at the\nnew Central Imagery Office in Washington\nD.C. The\nUnited States Air Force plans to showcase Eagle Vision at this year\'s Paris Air Show.\nIn conclusion,\nI was asked the other day what\nSPOT stands for. The secret is out, as depicted in this\nfinal slide! (Fig. 0S-17) Ladies and gentleman thank\nyou very much for your attention.\nDR. SWAN: Our next speaker is David Edwards. He\'s\nthe executive vice president and chief operating officer\nof Earth Observation\nSatellite Company. He\'s responsible for all of EOSAT\'s domestic and international\noperations including marketing, satellite mission management and follow-on satellite development.\nHe has\n19 years of experience in the aerospace industry, including 10 years with Hughes Aircraft. Before joining\nEOSAT, Mr. Edwards served since January 1990 as\ndirector of financial planning in Decision Support\nSystem at the Hughes Aircraft Corporation\nheadquarters in Los Angeles.\nHe has earned both a bachelor of arts and master\nof science degree in finance and accounting from\nAdelphi University\nin Garden City, New York. Mr.\nEdwards academic background\nincludes coursework in\noceanography\nat the Florida Institute of Technology.\nLet\'s welcome Mr. Edwards.\nMR. EDWARDS: Thank you. The Symposium\nis about\ngoing beyond the vision, so I would like to share with\nyou about how we see that.\nWhen I began thinking about what I should say to\nstart my talk, a quotation from W. Clement Stone\ncame to mind: "What the mind of man can conceive\nand believe, it can also achieve." This quotation makes\na lot of sense in light of the Symposium\'s\ntheme,\n\nFigure\n\nARE\n\nOPPORTUN1TES\n\nIN SPACE!\n\n0S-17\n\nbecause a lot of the technologies that we are talking\nabout are always pushing beyond the horizon. And\nremote sensing is one of these.\nThe Successful\n\nSatellite-Related\n\nTechnologies\n\nJust to recap a little bit. There has been significant\nsuccess in satellite communications.\nSteve Dorfman\ntalked about that earlier today. A lot of people have\ntalked about navigational\nsystems and GPS. Earth\nobservation\nwill be the next successful commercialization of space technology,\nwith partnerships\nbetween\ngovernments\nand the private sector. I find the significant thread that links these three technologies\nto be\ninteresting.\nIn satellite communications,\nGPS, and\nEarth observation,\npeople in the general public understand the technology and why they need it.\nIn communications\npeople are always looking for\nan easier way to access somebody else so they can\ncommunicate,\ntalk, and exchange information.\nNavigation--GPS--responds\nto people\'s desires to know\nwhere they are or, at least, to their hope of finding\ntheir way out from where they are. Earth observation\naddresses people\'s needs to know what it is going to\ntake for them to manage Earth resources in a very\npractical way.\nRemote sensing is now poised to follow the other\nsatellite-based\napplications\nalong the trajectory of\ninternational\nalliances, private-sector\ninitiatives, and\npublic-private\npartnerships.\nAnd the current focus on\noperational\nusers will lead to geometric growth in the\nindustry (Fig. 0S-18).\nInternational\nPartnerships\nWe in the United States can be justifiably proud of\nwhat we achieved with the U.S. Landsat program.\nRemote sensing, however, is as much an information\nindustry as it is a space industry. And in the Information Age, the need for accurate information\nand\nknowledge will make the nationality of Earth observing systems a secondary issue compared to the utility\nof the information provided.\nIn fact, users who limit\n59\n\n1 1TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nNew Vision of\nRemote sensing\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPrivate\n\nSector\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPublic\n\nI Private\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFocus\n\non Operational\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFigure\n\nInternational\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInformation\n\nPartnerships\n\n"Nations\n\nInitiatives\n\nwill\n\nwither\n\nknowledge\n\nAlliances\n\nwill\nAlvin\n\ntriumph"\n& HlOdl\n\nTofner\n\nUsers\n\nInfrastructure\n\n0S-18\n\nthemselves to data produced by satellites from their\nown countries\' domestic systems really risk cutting\nthemselves off from important information\nresources\n(Fig. 0S-19).\nThe bottom line is that Earth observation\nis inherently international\nbecause knowledge is international.\nThis does not mean that we will not continue to see\nnational systems like Landsat, SPOT, and the Indian\nRemote Sensing ORS) satellites. But it does mean that\ninternational\npartnerships\nand alliances that make data\nfrom a multitude of systems easily available for users\nworldwide are essential for the full potential of the\nremote-sensing\nindustry to be met.\nPrivate-Sector\nInitiatives\nand Public/Private\nAlliances\nLet me talk about some of EOSAT\'s\nalliances.\nOne is with Antrix, the commercial\narm of the Indian\nSpace Research Organization,\nISRO. Under our agreement with Antrix, EOSAT is the exclusive, worldwide\nmarketer of data from the eight-satellite\nconstellation\nto be launched by India over the next 10 years. Two\nof these satellites are already flying today. In October\nof this year, a third satellite will be launched, IRS-1C,\nwhich has a combination\nof panchromatic\ndata with\nspatial resolution between eight and 10 meters and\nfour multispectral\nbands. In 1997, a duplicate satellite,\nIRS-1D, will be launched. By ensuring that the same\ndata sets will remain available in future years, IRS-1D\naddresses the issues of continuity raised by Ted Nanz.\nIRS-1C and 1D will also include a Wide Field Sensor\n(WiFS) with a 774-kilometer\nswath. The WiFS instrument will be particularly\nuseful in ocean sensing.\nThese are the two systems we have coming along\nin the near term, and they will be followed by four\nothers. We will being doing a few studies to help our\npartners in India decide what instruments\nshould fly on\nthese later satellites.\nWe have also become a distributor for Japan\'s\nRESTEC, which holds the rights to JERS data. As we\nhave found out since we started selling JERS data last\nOctober, there are a lot of clients we have not been\n\n60\n\nRemote Sensing is International\n\nFigure 0S-19\nable to support with data from Landsat because of\ncloud cover. The radar sensor on JERS sees through\nthe clouds and thus produces cloud-free data. We have\nbeen satisfying quite a few clients: since October,\nEOSAT has become the single largest distributor of\nJERS data.\nEOSAT has also entered into alliances with the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA). We have an agreement with ESA to start receiving ERS-1 data at our\nNorman, Oklahoma ground station, and then to leverage that into ERS-2 once that satellite is launched.\nActual distribution rights to ERS-1 data are held by an\ninternational\nconsortium,\nand we have signed a parallel\nagreement with one of the consortium\nmembers,\nRADARSAT\nInternational,\nwhich allows us to distribute ERS-1 data.\nOur ground station in Norman, Oklahoma,\nillustrates how the private sector and public sector can\nwork together to expand the availability of remote\nsensed data for the growing market (Fig. 0S-20). The\nstation is commercially\noperated, but it receives data\nfrom the U.S. Government\'s\nLandsat system, ESA\'s\nERS-1, and India\'s IRS-1B and IRS-P2.\nEOSAT has a partnership\nwith Telespazio called\nTeleos. This is a commercial\nversion of the U.S. Air\nForce\'s Eagle Vision, which Ted talked about. We\nhave put a portable ground station in Nairobi. We\nwent into Kenya because, as you heard from earlier\npanels, one of the biggest problems in developing\ncountries is the data deficiency resulting from a lack of\ninfrastructure.\nDeploying a portable ground station in\ndata-deficient\nareas of the world gives us an opportunity to build the infrastructure,\nbeginning with the\nground station itself, and then add the training and\neducation needed to build the market. As the infrastructure develops, a more permanent ground station\ncan be built, and we can take this portable one and go\nto another data-deficient\narea (Fig. 0S-21).\nWe also have a partnership\nwith PADCO and\nKibirso to bring Russian high-resolution\nsatellite data\nto the market. PADCO is an American company;\nKibirso is a Russian GIS company.\n\nTHERE\n\nNorm;\n\nIII_\n\ni=,i_\n\nI Pavate\n\nARE\n\nOPPORTLINITF_\n\nIN SPACE!\n\nSecto_nitiatives\n\nPublic / Private Alliances\n\nFigure\n\n0S-20\n\nFigure\n\n0S-22\n\nIncreasingOperational Use\nBenefits Everyone\n\nEOSAT - Telespazio Alliance\n\nNew\nUsers\n\nCurrent\nUsers\n\n1creased\nCoverage\nGround\n\nof\nStation\n\nNairobi,\n\nPortable\n(PGS)\nKenya\n\n/\n\nData\n\n/\n\nResearch\nIncreased\nInvestment\nMarket\n\nFigure\n\n0S-21\n\nThis slide gives you some sense of the expansion\nassociated with the significant amount of investment\ncoming in from private industry as well as from\npublic-private\nalliances (Fig. 0S-22). Most of the\ncompanies and organizations\nshown on this slide are\nrepresented\nhere today. And this is not a complete list,\nbut it gives a fantastic demonstration\nthat this is an\never-growing\nindustry.\nThese are the kinds of partnerships\nand alliances\nthat the remote-sensing\nindustry needs to encourage.\nOperational\nUsers Drive the Market\nWhat is driving the remote-sensing\nmarket? Operational users. To address the needs of operational users,\nthe industry is focusing on making the data easier to\nget and easier to use. For EOSAT, the focus on the\noperational user includes expanding our product line to\noffer formats and media that are easier to work with.\nWe have joined forces with software and value-added\ncompanies to create products tailored to specific market segments. We are expanding the selection of data\nsets we sell so that data users only need to make one\nphone call to find the remotely sensed data they need.\nLet me stress that the focus on operational users\ndoes not mean that scientific research is neglected. As\n\nFigure\n\n0S-23\n\nthe base of operational\nusers grows--and\ndata sources\nare added to serve them--researchers\nwill have more\ndata from which to choose. Continuing research, of\ncourse, improves the effectiveness\nof the operational\nuse of the data. Thus, both researchers\nand operational\nusers benefit (Fig. 0S-23).\nAn Information\nInfrastructure\nfor Remote Sensing\nIf we look at how everybody is benefiting from\nthis, we can see that the international\nalliances,\nprivate-sector\ninitiatives, public-private\npartnerships,\nin\nwhat can be called an "Information\nInfrastructure."\nand the focus on the operational\nusers come together\n(Fig. 0S-24) From the standpoint of the whole industry, what is key is not the ground segment, or the\nhandshakes\non the international\npartnerships--it\nis the\nusers. The revenue that is going to drive the growth in\nthis industry comes from them. Worrying about a\nhardware competition\nbetween one instrument supplier\nand another, one satellite supplier and another is not\nreally going to make a difference in this industry.\nWhat makes a difference is how we get users their\ndata and satisfy their information\nneeds.\n\n61\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nOPERATINGIN A SPEEDOF LIGHTENVIRONMENT\nInformation Infrastructure\n\nFigure\n\nFigure\n0S-26\n\n0S-24\n\nMAJOR\n\nINITIATIVES\n\nINVOLVING\n\nGPS\n\nGPS USAGE\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDOT\'S\n\nDECISION\n\n8q\n6q\n4q\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n2q\n\n1980\n\nTHE NATIONAL\nWHICH\nIS PART\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 THE\n\nINTELLIGENT\n\nAMERICA\n(NOW\nTRANSPORTATION\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNATIONAL\nVICE\n\nIN THE\n\nGPS\nAIR,\n\nSPATIAL\nDATA\nOF REINVENTING\n\n0S-25\n\nConclusion\nWhat we are trying to\ndata and our international\ninformation\ninfrastructure.\ninformation\ninfrastructure,\na new reality today.

In addition, he has been a consultant over the last few years. He was the director of\nStrategic Systems, Advanced Systems Development,\nRockwell International\nat the corporate offices from\nAugust 1981 to 1986. Prior to 1981 he held many\ncritical positions in industry and government,\nmany\ndealing with space. He graduated from West Point in\nJanuary 1943.

KANE: Thank you for the introduction,\nand sincere thanks to General Hill and Dick MacLeod for\ninviting our GPS International\nAssociation\nto co-sponsor the 1 Ith Space Foundation\'s\noutstanding\nspace\nsymposium,\nespecially the sponsorship\nof GIA\'s first\nannual meeting Friday morning. We are privileged to\nparticipate.\nAs you know, GPS started as a military program,\nbut now the civil users have awakened to what the\nservices have learned over the past years, namely, that\nthe use of GPS increases productivity,\ncontributes to\nsafety, and is important to security (Fig. 0S-25).\nVisions of Commercial\nOpportunities\nIn my discussion I plan to focus on the civil users\nof the GPS community and how they benefit from the\nsame attributes--producing\nsafety and security. First, I\nwould like to make some global observations.\nSome Global Observations\nThe Space Age is now some 40 years old and most\npeople have spent their entire lives in the Space Age.\nAnd we have been living in a rain of electrons and\nphotons, soon to become a torrent. I call it "Living in\na Speed-of-Light\nEnvironment"\n(Fig. 0S-26). GPS is\n\nTHERE\n\nWIDE\n\nFigure\n\nAREA\n\nAUGMENTATION\n\nARE\n\nOPPORTUNITES\n\nIN SPACE!\n\nSYSTEM\n\n0S-28\n\nunique among the space systems because it is the only\none in which we, the users, can interact with it. If we\nhave problems with signal reception and we want to\nknow whether it is our equipment or the satellites that\nare the source of our difficulties,\nwe can call the Coast\nGuard Navigation Center in Alexandria,\nVA and ask\nwhy our display shows that SV13 is not performing.\nOr we can call Colonel Pete Worden, Commander\nof\nthe 50th Space Wing here in Colorado Springs or his\n2nd Space Operations\nSquadron to learn why our\nGDOP is so poor.\nClasses and Types of Users\nThere are four major on-going initiatives involving\nGPS and impacting on nearly all of us users (Fig. 0S27).\nThose of you who are familiar with our inaugural\nnewsletter have seen the list of 123 types of users\ncompiled by George Wiggers of the POS/NAV office\nof DOT Policy and Will Johnson, the GIA Executive\nDirector. I have a different version, one with broad\nclasses of users.\nFirst are static users, the surveyors.\nThey were\namong the first to grasp the importance of GPS for\nposition location because it enhances productivity.\nOne\nsurveyor can do in one day as much as five in a week.\nSecond are the mappers. They have literally inherited the Earth. GPS has made all pre-GPS maps ob\nsolete. We\'re doing this whole thing all over again.\nImagine mapping Russia to GPS accuracy.\nThese two classes are highly specialized and use\nspecial receivers--12\nto 24 channels. The National\nOceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration\nhas proposed\na new national spatial database system consisting of a\nnational space network as the basis for mapping and\nsurveying.\nThe third class is the heart of opportunities-mobile\nusers who want productivity,\nsecurity, and safety. Their numbers are huge:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Trucks\n46 million\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cars\n144 million (Stolen cars is the\ngrowth industry in Europe)\n\nFigure\n\n0S-29\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Railroad\n\nCars\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Buses\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 People\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Locomotives\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ships\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Containers\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Aircraft\n\n1.2 million\n70,000\nHow many million hikers,\ncampers?\n78,000\n8,000\n500,000 (40,000 added each\nyear)\n298,000\n\nOf course, the global numbers are even much higher,\nas the world capitalizes on this free, global utility.\nDifferential\nnavigation has been with us for some\ntime. The surveyors,\nonce again, were among the first\nto want and use it. In Texas, for example, we have 10\ntowers surveyors are using. There are commercial\napplications\ndeveloped by AccuPoint,\nDCI, and John\nE. Chance and Associates, but there will be a big\nboost when Augmented GPS is available through the\nFAA\'s Wide Area Augmentation\nSystem and Local\nArea GPS. When we need accuracy in our business,\nwhether static or mobile, we will have the capability\nfor increased productivity\nthrough Augmented GPS\n(Fig. 0S-28).\nThe fourth class is the time community.\nAs the\ndata networks expand to transmit the planned 40 gigabytes per second, time for synchronization\nwill be\ncome dominant. This chart illustrates some of the\nhighspeed networks being developed for traffic at this\nspeed (Fig. 0S-29).\nAs Dr. Bob Bonometti of the White House has\npointed out, GPS is the key to three major ways in\nwhich GPS impacts on the National Information\nInfrastructure, now the Global Information\nInfrastructure\n(Fig. 0S-30). The specs for GPS II, IIA, and IIR are\n100 nanoseconds of accuracy for the time signal. The\nmeasured performance\nis about 30 nanoseconds.\nThe\nNaval Observatory\nis trying for one picosecond,\nif you\ncan imagine accuracy to that degree, let alone measure\nit.\nBut the big winners for the GPS revolution are the\ncommunications\ncompanies.\nAll mobile users depend\n63\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nUTILIZATION\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nOF GPS BY THE Nil\n\nOF PROPOSED\nSATELLITE\n\nLEO TELECOMMUNICATIONS\nSYSTEMS\n\n(> 1 GHz)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 WIDE-AREA SYNCHRONIZATION OF HIGH SPEED NETWORKS\n-\n\nTDMA\n\nNETWORKS\n\nRAPID\n\nACQUISITION\n\nSATELLITE\n\nOF\n\nFRAME\n\nSYNCHRONIZATION\n\nSYSTEMS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GLOBAL TIMING AND POSITIONING UTILITY TO TAG\nINFORMATION\nVALIDATION\n-\n\nNOT\n\nOF\n\nADDRESSED\n\nINFORMATION\nIN\n\nTRANSMISSION\n\nB*ISDN\n\nPROTOCOLS\n\n(YETI)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NErWORK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS\n-\n\nMOBILE\n,,\n-\n\n-\n\nUSER\n\nPOSITION\n\nPERSONAL\n\nPHONE\n\nNOMADIC\n\nADVANCED\n\nDETERMINATION\n\nFOR\n\nNil\n\nACCESS\n\nPORTS\n\nNUMBERS\n\nCOMPUTING\nDISTRIBUTED\n\nNETWORK\n\nINTELLIGENCE\n\nFOR\n\n"SITUATIONAL\n\nAWARENESS"\n.,\n\nSMART\n\nPDA\n\n(CORDLESS,\n-\n\nSTOCHASTIC\n\nTERMINALS\nMICRO-CELLULAR,\nNE]_NORKING\n\nCHOOSE\n\nWIRELESS\nCELLULAR,\n\nAMONG\n\nACCESS\n\nMODES\n\nSATELLITE...)\n\nCOOPERATIVE\n\nMOBILE\n\nPLATFORMS\n\nFigure\n\n0S-30\n\non communications\nfor tracking, for reporting location, for planning on-time delivery. Trucks are becoming mobile warehouses.\nThey can be rerouted to most\ncustomers\'\ndemands or changing requirements.\nAs a result, we are going to see what I call the\n"Marriage Made in Orbit," the marriage of GPS and\nPCS. Our hand-held transceiver\nwill show\nlatitude/longitude\nand time with GPS accuracy. Now\nwe can know where the Capitol Building is (N 38 \xc2\xb0 53\'\n24", W 77 \xc2\xb0 0" 32"); it is 249 feet from where we\nthought it was. If you want to locate the Eiffel Tower\n(N 48 \xc2\xb0 51\' 35", E 20 \xc2\xb0 17\' 40"), or the Tower of\nLondon (N 51 o 30\' 45", W 00 \xc2\xb0 04\' 90"), just consult\nyour Lat/Long for the precise location.\nBefore, I alluded to the coming torrent of electrons\nand protons. This chart is one of several that summarizes the explosion in proliferation\nof communications\nsatellites at LEO (Fig. 0S-31). These are the "Little\nLEOS," small in size and deployed in low Earth orbit.\nThe ORBCOMM\nsatellite, for example, will weigh\nonly 98 pounds and provide two-way paging.There\nare\nalso the "Big LEOS,"\nMEOs, LEOs, and GEOs yet to\ncome. The numbers are nearly incredible. The\nplanned Teledesic production\nis for over 2,000 satellites. As the Air Force study of the future of space,\ncalled Space Cast 2020, speculated,\nwe may be approaching the need for space traffic control.\nIn summary, my vision is one of unlimited opportunities for productivity\nin business, safety in travel,\nand security everywhere.\nTime is no longer of the\nessence, it is the essence of future business. We users\nhave a bright future ahead of us.\nDR. SWAN: Thank you. Teledesic is really making\nIRIDIUM \xc2\xae a credibility,\nyou know. We thought we\nhad a lot of satellites, but its 840 is a lot. It is going to\nhave to go from a 22-day assembly to a lot less than\nthat.\nOur next speaker is Mr. Courtney Stadd. He is a\nmanaging partner for Global Technology\nVentures, a\nMaryland-based\ncompany providing a full spectrum of\ninvestment, business, marketing,\nand planning support\n64\n\nFigure\n\n0S-31\n\nto a broad range of technology clients. He has held\nseveral high level federal government\npositions. These\nassignments\ninclude senior director for Commercial\nSpace Policy, the White House National Space Council; director, Office of Commercial\nSpace Transportation, U.S. Department\nof Transportation;\nspecial assistant for Space Commerce,\nOffice of the Space Secretary, U.S. Department\nof Commerce.\nHis last job\nwhile he was in the government\nwas the special assistant to the NASA Administrator\nand NASA Deputy\nAssociate Administrator\nfor the Office of Advanced\nConcepts in Technology\xe2\x80\xa2\nPlease welcome Courtney\nStadd.\nMR. STADD: First of all, thank you very much. I am\nparticularly\npleased to speak this afternoon, because\nthe last time I spoke about a space topic was as a\nprivate citizen before the House Appropriations\nSubcommittee. It asked me as part of a panel to talk about\nthe future of the space program. And I, for better or\nfor worse, held forth about my views that NASA\'s\nculture had long become an anathema to entrepreneurship in its broadest risk-taking definition--very\nmuch\naided and abetted by the political system. This makes\nme all the more glad to see my good friend Bill\nClaybaugh touting a title called business manager. It\'s\na good sign.\nUnfortunately,\nI may have come across as more of\na skeptic about our future in space than I intended at\nthe time, and I hope that these remarks will show that\nI am, in fact, quite bullish about our opportunities\nin\nspace.\nMaybe because much of my company\'s\ntechnology\nclient base is caught up in the earth-shaking\nrealities of\nthe digital electronics revolution,\nit strikes me that\nsometimes our perspective in the space community\nseems a bit disconnected\nfrom the real world many of\nus face when we leave conferences like this and return\nto our jobs. But it is indeed within the context of those\nrealities that opportunities\nfor space entreprenureship\nneed to be calibrated.\n\nTHERE\n\nA few anecdotes about the incredible changes\nchanging the economic landscape will, I hope, make\nmy point. While many of us in the space community\nwatch in dismay as government\nand industry announce\npending payroll cuts, keep in mind that we are just\nplaying catch up with a parallel universe. To wit: in\nthe last few years all the blue chips, be it the Boeings,\nthe Kodaks, the DECs, the Phillips, the Compaqs,\netc., have been undergoing\nmajor restructuring\nwhich\noften decimates the work force, especially the white\ncollars. We have not seen the last of the empowerment\nrevolution by a long shot.\nInsecurity and gambling on the next opportunity\nwave is a fundamental feature of life in the\ntechnology-based\nworld we now find ourselves in. A\nrandom walk through today\'s technology-based\ncommercial marketplace\nwould have seemed purely fanciful to attendees of the First National Space Symposium\n11 years ago. Just imagine telling folks back then\nabout a Hewlett Packard that runs its 9,000 person\nink-jet factory with a headquarters\nstaff of four people.\nNintendo with only 892 workers racks up $5.5 billion\nin sales--S6 million per employee--and\nranks third in\n\'92 profits in all of Japan. (These anecdotes are taken\nfrom Tom Peter\'s The Seminar: Crazy 7_mes Call for\nCrazy Organizations,\nVintage, NY, 1994.)\nCheap technology has penetrated economies\naround the world. In \'94 we Americans spent more on\nPCs than on TVs, and today more than 5,000 Vietnamese own digital cellular phones. All of us in this\nroom, if you took an accounting, face an average of\n300 program electronic micro-controllers\neach day of\nour lives. In my case, my own Cannon camera has\nmore intelligence than an early "80s version of the\nApple II.\nThe Space Age that gave us the Digital Age is\nturning the economic world upside down and creating\nendless entrepreneurial\nopportunities.\nOf course this\nbrave new world is giving all of us one hell of a beating. The AT&Ts of the world have taken billions of\ndollars in charges since \'84 to get rid of obsolete jobs\nand equipment.\nThe IBMs, the DECs, the Wang Laboratories are still recovering\nfrom the near death blow\ndealt by the microprocessor.\nAnd as an example of\nhow zany the world has become, who would have\nthought Taiwan\'s Acer Inc., an aggressive PC price\ncutter, would move most of its assembly plant to the\nU.S. market? To San Jose, in fact. Where product\ncycles are the shortest, such as PCs, factories have\nremained inside the biggest markets--the\nU.S. and\nJapan--to\nsave shipping time. And again, who would\nhave guessed that would be the situation a couple of\nyears ago?\nWith all the talk of downsizing\nand outsourcing\nin\nrecent years, those of us in the technology investment\nsector are not surprised to learn that Manpower,\nInc.,\nthe nation\'s largest provider of temporary workers,\nnow has more than a half million people on its roles.\nIndeed, the nation\'s temporary work force has grown\n\nARE\n\nOPPORTUNITES\n\nIN SPACE!\n\n250 percent since 1982, while the total work force has\nrisen by only 20 percent. And more and more firms\nare specializing\nin providing temporary CEOs and VPs\nand senior project managers to networked companies\nthat view, according to management\nguru Tom Peters,\n"permanence\nas a mortal sin."\nNot a week goes by that I don\'t receive a call\nfrom an old friend in NASA or aerospace company\nsetting out a shingle as a management\nexecutive trying\nto play some role in this networked world.\nAs I said, the aerospace world is certainly playing\ncatch up to the upheavals that are reshaping major\nchunks of our society. Every time the political system\n(Republicans\nor Democrats) tries to outguess the marketplace when it comes to the future world of this\ntechnology driven society of ours, it\'s wrong. It\'s\noften dead wrong. And since our space world is fundamentally dependent on gobs of silicon and tons of\nchips, it is critical to be mindful of the new economics\nshaping high-tech products.\n\nThe Space Age that gave us the Digital Age\nis turning\n\nthe economic\n\nand creating\n\nendless\n\nworld upside down\nentrepreneurial\n\nopportunities.\n\nLast week\'s Business Week contained an article\ntitled "Technology\nParadox,"\nwhich I thought did an\nexcellent job of describing this new economic reality.\nRemember the panic surrounding\nDRAMs, the\ndynamic random access memory chips, a few years\nago? U.S. makers fled the marketplace\nin the wake of\nalleged Japanese dumping. Well, guess what happened? The market ultimately found new uses--e.g.,\nWindows software--which\nare pervasive and gobble\nmegabytes of DRAMs. Unit prices fell; gross revenues\nsoared. And on the horizon we see a new wave of\ndemand in.the form of computers that obey spoken\ncommands and communicate\nin 3-D images. Beyond\nthat, as the magazine points out, perhaps believable\nVirtual Reality? What about intelligent artificial intelligence? It is highly probable that someone in this audience is either working on some space-derived\ntechnology (after all, aerospace was the big driver with VR)\nthat will take us another generation beyond in terms of\napplications.\nIn the Digital Age, the economy and society are\nprofoundly reshaping themselves to take advantage of\na demand for digital resources that are infinitely elastic. Be it computers that talk and whose messages can\nbe carried over satellite-based\nnetworks, or satellites\nthat track stolen vehicles, or containerized\npackages,\nor combined with digital-based\nsmart car technologies\nto provide customized tracking of corporate and personal assets. The list goes on and on, truly limited\nonly by the regulatory environment\nand the imagina65\n\n11TH NATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\ntion of the corporate CEOs and their organizations\nand\nalliances.\nIt is important to understand\nthat our very survival\ndepends on acknowledging\nthat the fundamentals\nmany\nof us in this room grew up with--multiple-year\nbusiness strategic plans, deliberate pacing of multiyear\nproduct cycles (a world in which NASA\'s technology\nculture itself was formed)--no\nlonger exists. The ultimate paradox was summarized\nby our moderator\'s\nformer boss, George Fisher, now chairman and CEO\nof Eastman Kodak. He said, "The only thing that\nmatters is if the exponential growth of your market is\nfaster than the exponential decline of your prices."\n\nIn the void left by the decline\npurchasing\nof creative\n\nin federal\n\nspace\n\npower, we see the re-emergence\nfunding\n\nkicked around\n\nideas that used to be\n10, 15 years ago.\n\nAnd that is the world to which the digital-based\ninformation\nproducts of space--remote\nsensing, GPS,\nLEO telecommunications,\ndirect broadcast--and\nother\nspace commerce application opportunities\non the horizon must learn to adjust in order to succeed.\nThat issue of Business Week I referred to earlier\ncontains a compelling example of what I\'m referring\nto--the emergence of digital TV satellites. GM Hughes\nElectronics began planning this project four years ago\nafter it calculated that the necessary components,\nthen\nfar too costly, were on the verge of becoming affordable. A European partner, France\'s Thompson,\nwas\nable to offer a home dish and decoder starting at $699.\nSince last June more than 400,000 American homes\nhave signed up.\nBasing a costly investment on a technology too\npricey at the time the business plan was drawn up\nsounds a little crazy. Turns out to be very canny.\nThat\'s the crazy world we\'re living in today. But the\nfact of the matter is that the folks who envisioned this\nparticular opportunity\nrealized that every 18 months or\nso improvements\nin chip-making\ntechnology make it\npossible to double the performance\nof silicon at no\nincrease in price. Around the year 2000, high volume\nmicroprocessors\nwill execute more than one billion\ninstructions per second, allowing designers to generate\na limitless range of products from holographic\nvideoconferencing\nto personal digital assistance. There is no\ndoubt that a successor to today\'s remote sensing and\nGPS ventures will be intimately involved in some\naspects of these new business opportunities.\nHaving tried, however feebly, to underscore the\nwacky and the bizarre marketplace\nawaiting spacerelated opportunities,\n-allow me to spend a moment or\ntwo focusing specifically\non the paradoxical forces\nshaping the space arena. These are forces that appear\nto wreak havoc for champions of the status quo, but\n66\n\nthey pose tremendous entrepreneurial\nopportunity\nfor\nthe risk takers among us.\nNotwithstanding\nthe tremendous\ninertia and the\nagonizingly\nslow process that appears associated with\nit from time to time, we are, I think, seeing incremental steps in the transition from a government-planned\neconomy which, after all, has characterized\nthe civil\nspace program to one that is more market-based.\nAlthough NASA\'s RLV, Lunar Prospector,\nDiscovery\nprograms,\nand so forth are indeed a minuscule part of\nthe overall civil space budget, there\'s no denying that\nthe trend is going in the right direction.\nAnd for the\nfirst time in memory, the government\nand industry\nseem to be, if not in lockstep, at least well coordinated\nin their efforts to coalesce around a strategy for building low-cost launch systems fundamental to realizing\nmany of the space opportunities\noutside the satellitebased information\nareas we\'ve been talking about.\nAt the same time, federal space purchasing\npower\nis under attack with the very real prospect of it being\nreduced by one-third or more in the next few years.\nThis real reduction in spending is the real motivation,\nquite frankly, behind formerly verboten topics such as\nseeking to privatize shuttle operations. But now these\nthings are being reopened for re-examination\nand\nprovide opportunities\nas the roles and missions between the public and private sectors are being redefined.\nUnder the reinvigorated\nleadership of the House,\nspecifically Bob Walker of the House Committee on\nScience, Congress appears open to a range of what I\ncall "risk mitigation tools," which are fundamental\nto\nthose of us who work in the investment world. Examples include tax relief on space products for a limited\nperiod of time, perhaps even some forms of termination liability, innovative space privatization\nschemes,\nand so forth.\nAnd there also appears to be, as loony as it may\nseem at first, an emergence of a grass-roots\nadvocacy\nfor opening up space frontier to the population-atlarge. This is a movement expressing\nits deep dissatisfaction at a situation where the world\'s greatest democracy has supported a program that has become the\nprovince of a small, technically trained elite. One of\nthe leaders of this movement is, in fact, Tom Rogers,\nwho spoke this morning.\nIn the post Cold War era, this perspective\nis shaping an environment\n(which may take a generation or\ntwo or more to come to fruition) that may, indeed,\nsupport opportunities\nsuch as space tourism, and space\nsports down the road. In the post Cold War era, the\ninternational\nspace marketplace\nis opening up rapidly\nto commercial\nspace opportunities.\nName the joint\nventure across the Atlantic or across the Pacific, and,\nif it hasn\'t been tried, you can bet it\'s on somebody\'s\ndrawing board as we meet here today.\nIn the void left by the decline in federal space\npurchasing power, we see the re-emergence\nof creative\nfunding ideas that used to be kicked around 10, 15\n\nTHERE ARE\n\nyears ago. I\'m hearing people talk about space trust\nfund mechanisms,\nprivately funded in part. I\'m hearing about space prizes. People are now resurrecting\nthe idea of privately supported prizes not unlike what\nwe saw in the pioneering\nage of aviation. In my case,\nI\'m developing a nonprofit that provides small private\ngrants to fledgling space entrepreneurial\nventures.\nSince I am involved in the capital world, let me\nvery quickly say that there\'s no shortage of it. In the\n\'80s businesses raised $126 billion in the capital markets. Ten years later they raised over $1 trillion. Indeed last year, for the first time ever, investment\ncompany assets now exceed the total deposits of the\ncommercial banking system. Who says the \'90s are not\nas go-go as the \'80s in their own way?\nBut little of that capital is going into financing\nspace-related\nventures until the near term space projects (low earth orbiting Comsats, such as Iridium)\nshow some payoffs, and until the political system\ndemonstrates\na commitment\nto the public-private\nrhetoric we\'ve been hearing recently until today\'s CEOs of\ntomorrow\'s\nspace ventures are able to creatively link\ntheir products and services to the digital global economy.\nI will conclude with some potential investment\nopportunites\nin space commerce over the next few\nyears. I think there\'s an incredible, suppressed\ndemand\nout there for mobile telecommunications,\nand I think\nthat Iridium and one or two others providing voice\ncapability will be successful pathfinders.\nI see at least\ntwo non-voice LEOs succeeding in creating a blockbuster industry--opening\nup literally new industries\nfrom asset management\nto global E-Mail, delivery\nsystems, global emergency related systems, satellitebased CD digital radio services, and satellite-based\ndigital TV. GPS is an unbelievable\nmarketplace.\nThe\ngovernment\npredicts a four to five billion dollar GPS\nmarket by the end of the decade. I think it will be\ndouble that and I\'m probably being conservative.\nGPS\nis an area my company is very excited about. It is a\nbusiness that\'s growing by rapidily, it appears, every\nday.\nSatellite-based\ntracking and positioning services, I\nbelieve, will be a several hundred million dollar industry very quickly in the next couple of years. And\ncertainly satellite remote sensing. It\'s always easy to\noutguess the bureaucrats.\nCommerce says at least $2\nbillion by the end of the decade. Certainly at least\ndouble that, if not more, would be a very safe bet, I\nthink, just based on suppressed demand.\nIt\'s very hard to predict these trajectories for any\nof these technologies.\nFor example, one of our clients\nhas a pioneering\nand versatile low-cost electronic\ntagging system using smart-card\ntechnology.\nYou\ncombine that with any one of the various satellite\ntracking and positioning ventures, and you could have\nincredible implications\nfor customizing various and\nsundry markets.\n\nOPPORTUNITES\n\nIN SPACE!\n\nI think there\'s some exciting potential for at least a\ncouple of the commercial\nspaceports that are out there.\nAnd I believe you\'ll see a resurrection\nof some of the\nold platform concepts--the\nuse of the external tank,\nfor example--in\nthe next few years. Finally, companies such as Lunar Corporation\nhave talked about the\ncommercial potential for telerobotics\non other planetary surfaces.\nSo I would conclude by saying that what we can\nbe sure of is that, notwithstanding\nthe fiscal realities\nand the economic and political craziness of the world\nwe all face, that this is an incredible moment, I think,\nin our history in terms of developing the space frontier. I believe that we have a chance to ensure that the\nnext "Space Age" may be even richer, more varied,\nand more empowering\nthan the one that 25 years ago\nmotivated many of us to be part of what is the ultimate\nfrontier, I believe, for opportunities.\nThank you for\nyour time.\nDR. SWAN: Thank you. I\'m glad to hear that there\'s\ngoing to be a lot of money out there. That\'s good.\nLots of opportunities.\nQ&A\nDR. SWAN: We\'ve been given some questions here\nthat I\'ll ask of the members.\nThe first question is for Mr. Nanz. The International French Subsidy of the SPOT system has\nmade SPOT data available. Why is this called commercial? That\'s a loaded question, so I thought I\'d\nstart off with that.\nMR. NANZ: I\'m happy to have that question. The\nanswer is that we are in the midst of a 10-year time\nschedule to become totally commercial.\nAnd in the\nearly days, we were subsidized (not the right word),\nbut the satellite was designed, launched, and managed\nby CNES. As we progressed\nthrough this decade, I\nknow because my chief financial officer reminds me\nevery day, we are paying more and more of our way\nto that system.\nDR. SWAN: Thank you. This question is for Dr. Kane.\nWith GPS available to the whole world, how is cost\nshared and how can a potentially unfriendly user be\ndenied its use?\nDR. KANE: The answer to the first part of the question\nis that there is no cost sharing with users. GPS is free\nto everyone, globally. The costs of the system are\nborne by the U.S. taxpayer and funded through the\nAir Force budget.\nAs for the second question, I\'ve been asked the\nquestion for 30 years. It dates back to the very beginning, before it was GPS, and before we had satellites\nfor warfare. How do you deny it to the enemy? It\'s\nwhat we call the continuing true dilemma. That\'s what\n67\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nfaces the Air Force and DoD every day: what to do\nabout this problem?\nOne answer is to deny the enemy access to the\nPrecision Code (the P Code); the other is to modulate\nthe clear code through a technique called Selective\nAvailability (SA). By using SA, we degrade the precision of the clear code. That affects the enemy; but we\nalso degrade the signal for civil users.\nThe villain, of course, in this problem is GPS,\nbecause it sends out signals. I\'ve been trying to tell the\n"blue suiters" for these 30 years that GPS is like bullets, airplanes, guided missiles--it\'s\na resource to use\nin war. Sometimes you have the signal on; sometimes\nyou have it off. What is the commander\ntrying to do in\nthe war at that time? Why doesn\'t he use GPS like he\ndoes anything else? To make his forces more effective\nor to deny the enemy forces from being effective.\nEveryone gasps at the idea to try to do that. But to\nme, if Dr. Swan can have his IRIDIUM** operate over\nthe U.S. and not over Iraq, why can\'t GPS do that?\nThere\'s a barrier here that says the problem is GPS;\nthe real problem is that we have to recognize that\nfighting wars include new ways of thinking about GPS\nand all satellites. My solution is to think about GPS in\nthe military environment.\nAnd it\'s not a U.S. problem.\nI ask my French friends the same question. "O.K.,\nyou\'re having problems with Algeria. You think the\nAlgerians have a guided missile. Do you want to call\nup President Clinton or President Whomever\nand say\nPlease turn GPS off\'?" Then the rest of the world gets\nmad at the U.S. for turning it off.\nThere is no single answer to this question. It\'s\ncircumstance\ndependent. You have to deal with the\noperational\nsituation at the specific time. But we who\nbuild and operate the satellites have to be much more\nsophisticated\nin how we control the satellites. When\nthe Block 2F is put together and they\'re able to control\nthe satellite within six seconds, we ought to be considering what to do with GPS as a war fighting resource.\nThat\'s the only way to solve the dilemma.\nThis present point of view is too narrow. The\nanswer lies in thinking about war.\nDR. SWAN: Thank you. The next question is for Mr.\nClaybaugh.\nYou say the RLV effort is what is going to\nbring down the price per pound ratio that is so important to the future marketing activities. Isn\'t this what\nthe shuttle was supposed to do? Yet it is the most\nexpensive launch vehicle for small payloads. Why is\nthe current RLV effort any different?\nCLAYBAUGH:\nI\'d note at least three differences,\nstarting with the fact that the shuttle was built by bureaucrats and if,/f, an RLV is built, it will be built by\nAmerican industry. In addition, I would suggest that\nalthough the shuttle is unquestionably\nan expensive\nasset, and in some ways the most expensive asset we\nfly, it\'s worth remembering\nthe shuttle is a flying\nspace station. The 250,000 pounds the shuttle puts in\nMR.\n\n68\n\norbit every time it flies includes a very capable spacecraft with on-board power, the ability to keep people\nalive for weeks, and the ability to maneuver back\nthrough the Earth\'s atmosphere\nand do it all again. To\nthink of the shuttle as comparable\nto an expendable\nlaunch vehicle is rather a lot like thinking of the space\nstation as if it were a launch vehicle.\nAnd lastly, I would note that a major emphasis of\nthe RLV program is operations.\nThe central driver on\nX-34 and subsequently\nX-33, from our point of view,\nfrom what the government\nis acquiring in these programs, is driving technology towards very, very highly operable systems. We are privately looking for\nsystems that can turn around in one day. That may not\nbe the official contracted number, but that is what we\nare telling our people now is the goal: Build us fully\nreusable launch vehicles that can be flown every day.\nI think, in combination,\nall that is vastly different\nthan the shuttle.\nDR. SWAN: Thank you. The next question is for Mr.\nEdwards. How is EOSAT storing the vast quantities it\nreceives and how long is that archived?\nMR. EI)WARIXS: EOSAT archives Landsat data in\nconjunction\nwith the government-run\nEROS Data\nCenter (EDC). Newly acquired TM data are archived\nfor the short term at an EOSAT facility in the Washington, D.C. area. This ensures ready access by our\ncustomers. Eventually all Landsat tapes, however, are\nshipped to EDC for long-term archiving. Data that is\nover 10 years old is available to the public from EDC.\nThis includes all of the original ERTS-1 (Landsat 1)\ndata beginning in 1972.\nDR. SWAN: Thank you. The next one is for the moderator. How does the IRIDIUM** integration assembly\nand test experience doing it in less than 22 days compare to other high-volume--e.g.\nGlobal star--satellite\nproduction experience? The answer is, I really don\'t\nknow. I\'m very familiar with our system. We\'re leading the way as far as I can tell in the sense of hardware. We started first--we\nreceived our financing\nfirst--so we\'re a little bit ahead of the others. Whether\nthat gets us into orbit, of course the market is still up\nin the air. We\'re still working those issues. I do know\nthat Orbcom, if it is going to put up its 30 satellites in\na cost effective manner, would have to do a different\napproach than the standard old government\napproach.\nGlobalstar will certainly have to be different.\nGlobalstar has an advantage, similar to Hughes and to\nthe RCA, GE, and Lockheed Martin, in its commercial geosynchronous\nsatellites experience.\nThe time\nframe is a lot shorter in that business. Loral has an\nadvantage in that it\'s starting from that point. So the\nanswer is, I don\'t know, but we should find out when\nthe first to market comes out and that\'s really what\ncounts, first to market--get\nthe revenue.\n\nTHERE\n\nO.K., Dr. Kane, what sort of policing mechanism\nwill be needed to keep the satellites from being\njammed or harmed by rogue nations?\nDR. KANE: That\'s essentially a variation of the question I answered earlier. When I used to brief on the\nidea of GPS, we had a scenario of flying a fighter\nplane through the Fulda Gap to bomb the Red Army.\nThe opponents of GPS would have the Soviets sow\nhundreds ofjammers\nin the ground and around the\nGap. And I\'d say, "O.K. I\'ll shoot the jammers."\n"You can\'t shoot the jammers."\n"Why can\'t you\nshoot the jammers?"\n"If you shoot the jammers,\nthe\nfighter gets through. But we don\'t want GPS, so don\'t\nshoot the jammers."\nThe whole problem is so complex that people pick\non pieces and try to answer it in that context. There\nare ways to prevent jamming and there are ways to use\njamming.\nYou may want to jam the satellites so the\nIraqis can\'t use GPS. You may want to jam only in his\nterritory or only in our territory. All those are games\nyou play in warfare. The offense does something and\nthe defense does something. In the information war\nthat\'s coming, GPS is one of the principal resources to\nbe used by the offense and defense. It is integrated\nwith the communications,\nthe surveillance\nsatellites,\nand multi-spectral\nimagery in the Command Center.\nAnd the commander\ndecides that today we jam from\n6:00 to 10:00 because we\'re expecting an attack at that\ntime, or we may not want to jam because we\'re expecting some C-5s to arrive between 6:00 and 10:00.\nIt\'s not a simple, easy answer. It\'s a commander\'s\nproblem to think through how to use this\nresource--GPS\nin a combat environment.\n\nARE\n\nOPPORTON1TF_\n\nIN SPACE!\n\nMR. PAYNE: Thank you to the session speakers and to\nDr. Swan for developing and moderating\nsuch an\noutstanding\nand informative session. Thank you very\nmuch.\nAt this time we\'re going to take a 15-minute break\nsponsored by Digital Electronics\nCorporation.\nWe will\nreconvene promptly at 3:45.\n\nSWAN:\nThe final question was addressed to the\ntotal panel. Is the demand and market size large\nenough to provide attractive returns on the huge initial\ninvestments required by companies pursuing new satellite applications\nin direct broadcast satellites, remote\nsensing, mobile communications,\netc.? If yes, what\nwill prohibit space technology manufacturers\nfrom\nentering these markets and intensifying competition\nfor\nthose already operating satellite networks?\nI think I\'ll answer for the panel. That\'s what we\'re\nseeing in the environment\ntoday. The traditional corporations, international\norganizations,\nINMARSAT,\nINTELSAT,\nAT&T, long lines are facing tough competition. That\'s where a lot of technological\ncompanies\nare going. The opportunities\nare there.\nI would like to thank the members of this panel\nand the United States Space Foundation for the chance\nto show that the global opportunities\nin space business\nare there. The excitement is growing. Space is changing. We, the professionals,\nin this room and our\nfriends elsewhere need to trade the vision and the\nDR.\n\nreality.

Well, the fact of the matter is, I know\nyou\'re not brain dead, but you\'re probably a little bit\ntired of listening to us. Hopefully we\'ve got a stimulating session for you to think about, debate about,\nand ask some questions about. And that\'s the part that\nwe\'re going to work with you on.\nThe subject is "We Can Achieve Competitive\nVision with Acquisition Reality." That\'s a nice subject, but quite frankly, what I\'d like to do is change\nthe name of the topic to "We must achieve competitive vision in DoD acquisition."\nSimply stated, we\'ve\ngot to get rid of the bells and whistles. There isn\'t any\nmore room for bells and whistles. We\'ve got to simply reduce the number of people involved. We\'ve got\nto be able to reduce the dollars. I know one of the\nspeakers earlier today said things in the space world\nare low cost enough, we don\'t need to think about\nreducing the dollars. But let\'s face it folks, when the\ntaxpayers see that $15 billion space budget, they want\nto reduce it. Believe me. And quite frankly (and you\nmay disagree with me on this and if you do, say so), I\nthink that we in the industry have to lead the charge.\nWe are the folks who I really think have the wherewithal and quite frankly, as someone said some time\nago, "if you ain\'t the lead dog, the scenery never\nchanges." We want the scenery to change so we want\nto be the lead dog, and that\'s what we\'ve got to concentrate on doing.\nBoth President Clinton and Dr. Perry have talked\na lot about acquisition reform. What they\'re really\ntalking about is that the budget is just not there to buy\nall of the equipment that the troops need if we continue at the levels that we are now. Therefore we need\nto think about ways to streamline, and about ways to\nreduce costs. Affordability\nis the watchword.\nYou\'re\ngoing to hear that again pretty soon. We must buy the\n\nWE\n\nkind of equipment that we need in order to get the job\ndone. But we\'ve got to get rid of the paper.\nFolks, we are sinking in paper. Our backs are up\nagainst the wall. Adlai Stevenson once said Americans\noften can\'t see the handwriting\non the wall until\nthey\'re backs are up against the wall, and that\'s where\nwe are now. Believe me, I\'m beginning to see the\nhandwriting\nand hopefully you are too.\nLet\'s talk a little bit about this business of reform.\nI know some of you out there are saying, "Wait a\nminute. What the heck are you talking about--reform?" The NRO started out as a "reform" organization. The NRO knows how to do business, and it\'s\ndone business in a streamlined\nway for a long time.\nLet me tell you something, folks. As far as in the\nmilitary space business is concerned, the NRO was the\ndumbest idea ever created in the space business. Now\neverybody says, "Whoa."\nI\'m not calling the NRO\ndumb--don\'t\nget me wrong. The idea that space intelligence was so important that we had to get that out of\nthe bureaucracy,\nthat\'s fine. But just think about what\nthe opposite says. On the other hand, military space is\nnot that important to get out of the bureaucracy,\nso\nwe\'ll let the military space program suffer under the\nbureaucracy.\nMeanwhile\nwe\'ll streamline the other\nside. That doesn\'t make sense.\nThere\'s no need for two different programs.\nAnd,\nof course, Jeff Harris is going to fix that, I hope; and\nhe\'s going to talk a little bit about that, I think, tomorrow. But let\'s stop and think of the costs associated with having those two different programs,\nand\nthat says that we\'ve got to do something about it and,\nquite frankly, as a taxpayer, I object to the different\napproaches to working the problem.\nThat\'s where I stand on the subject. We\'ve got a\nlot of outstanding panelists who are going to give us\nsome good words and, in fact, they\'re going to address a number of the questions and a number of the\nissues that were brought up this morning.\nBy the way, one thing I should say right off the\nbat. I heard somebody say it\'s going to take 10 years\nto acquire a weather satellite. Hopefully,\nit\'s not going\nto take that long with acquisition reform. I\'m looking\nat like six to seven years and, just think, we\'ll save a\nlot of money.\nSpace propulsion was raised as an issue, and of\ncourse, Joe Zimonis is an expert in that area. Commercial use was talked about a lot, and Frank Weaver\nis an expert in that area. Industrial cooperation was\ndiscussed a lot, and Doug Heydon is an expert there.\nMilitary space has been talked about, and Jim Noblitt\nis an expert. And, of course, space policy is definitely\nsomething that we all need to discuss, and Brenda\nForman is an expert in that area.\nWe\'re going to start, in fact, with Brenda, and I\'m\nsure most of you know Brenda Forman. She\'s an\nexpert in the business. She\'s a widely published author on space policy and trade policy. She has a\nmonthly column for the U.S. Space Foundation.\nShe\n\nCAN\n\nACHIEVE\n\nCOMPETITIVE\n\nVISION\n\nWITH\n\nACQUISITION\n\nREALITY\n\nwrites in Space News and Acquisition\nReview Quarterly. She joined Lockheed in 1983 as corporate\ndirector of marketing policy and before that she was\nwith OSD in international\nsecurity affairs and then\nwith MITRE. She developed a course which is quite\nhighly regarded at the University\nof Southern California Graduate School of Engineering\nand, in fact, she\'s\nteaching that course right now. As you know, she has\na Ph.D. in political science, is a member of Phi Beta\nKappa, a recipient of the Department\nof Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award, was an honorable\nmention honoree at the 27th Annual Wright Brothers\nBanquet, the Wright Women.\nLadies and gentlemen, please help me welcome\nDr. Brenda Forman.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2..\n\nthe budget is just not there to buy all of\n\nthe equipment\ncontinue\nTherefore\nstreamline,\n\nthat the troops\n\nneed if we\n\nat the levels that we are now.\nwe need to think about ways to\nand about ways to reduce\n\nAffordability\n\ncosts.\n\nis the watchword.\n\nFORMAN:\nIn policy terms, procurement\nreform\nis a "golden oldie." For some 40 years, a parade of\nprestigious blue ribbon panels has identified essentially\nthe same set of problems--the\nsystem takes too long,\nit costs too much, it discourages\ninnovation by penalizing risk-taking,\nand when it finally does field a\nweapon system, the technology\ninvolved is often already pass6.\nBut the status quo is essentially impervious to this\nsort of logic or expertise, because that is not the basis\nof its appeal to its multifarious\nconstituents.\nLogic and\nexpertise are irrelevant to this issue: wise counsel is\nlargely wasted effort because the procurement\nsystem\nas we know and love it today is the end product of\nsome 40 years of relentless politicization.\nIt is by now\nso deeply rooted that it is unlikely ever to be pruned\nback to what industry, at least, would regard as truly\nrational levels.\nAnd why? Because the system as it exists today\nnourishes an enormous and varied constituency.\nAll of\nwhose participants\ncommand powerful political resources.\nFrom their point of view, the system works\njust fine!\nViewed in this light, it\'s no wonder that 40 years\nof reform efforts haven\'t gotten us anywhere. Because\nreform, by definition, seeks to eliminate precisely the\ninefficiencies\nthat have helped to build the status quo\'s\nformidable\nconstituency\nand cement its resistance to\nchange.\nWhen reform finds itself unwelcome\nin so many\nquarters, it tells you that a lot of people are quite\nDR.\n\n71\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACR\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\ncontent, thank you, with the status quo. This has, in\nshort, become a system that feeds on itself--and nobody is innocent!\nIt\'s easy, for example, to blame government\nauditors for resisting reform in order to hang onto their\njobs. But remember, for every government\nauditing\nteam, the contractor being audited must field its own\ncounterpart team. Both teams thereby become dependent on the system for their jobs and livelihood--i.e.,\npart of the system\'s constituency.\nAn ambitious military officer eyeing his next\npromotion knows he must get his program manager\nticket punched along the way. He also knows that in\nso dangerously\npoliticized an environment,\nhe cannot\nafford any misstep, no matter how small. Detailed\noversight authority provides him with an important\ntool for demonstrating\nhis total control over his program and his complete knowledge of everything going\non in it. So even though the total cost of that oversight structure subtracts from the dollars available for\nhis program, he may not want to give it up. So he too\nfinds himself perforce part of the system\'s constituency.\n\n...reform,\nprecisely\n\nby definition,\n\nseeks to eliminate\n\nthe inefficiencies\n\nthat have helped\n\nto build the status quo\'s formidable\nconstituency\n\nand cement\n\nits resistance\n\nto\n\nchange.\n\nA congressman--or\nsometimes even more often, a\ncongressional\nstaffer--sees\na chance to make some\npolitical hay by portraying\nhimself as the defender of\nthe taxpayer\'s\ninterests. He (or she) seizes on some\ninfraction (real or perceived) of the system\'s convoluted regulations\nand sponsors a piece of legislation\nthat adds yet a further oversight layer to the process--all in the name of eliminating waste, fraud, and\nabuse. The system has thereby provided him with an\nopportunity\nfor what every politician wants: political\nvisibility.\nAs an ex-staffer friend put it, "Press is\nalmost like an aphrodisiac\nfor a congressional\npolitician." Furthermore,\nthat piece of legislation is now\nhis baby; so long as he remains in office, he will\nresist its appeal. He thereby joins the systems constituency.\nThen there\'s the curious symbiosis between audit\nand oversight on the one hand and the requirements\nprocess on the other. Everyone knows that over-specification and excessive requirements--a.k.a.\n"goldplating\'--add\nto a weapon system\'s cost. What is less\nwidely recognized\nis the way these also inflate the\noversight burden. The more requirements\nthat can be\nwritten into the contract, the more requirements\nthose\nengender for audits and oversights down the road.\n72\n\nThere is thus a mutuality of interest between those in\ncharge of generating requirements\nand those in charge\nof verifying that those requirements\nare met. Both\ngroups benefit from the system and thereby become\npart of its constituency.\nAnd if the secret truth be told, the long-suffering\ncontractors are not always innocent in all this either.\nWe live in the Age of Protests. You lose a competition, it\'s almost predetermined\nthat you lodge a protest--no matter how flimsy the grounds. This can be a\nvery handy-dandy\ncompetitive tool. At the very least,\nit may slow down your opposition.\nIf you\'re lucky,\nthe auditors will find something to object to. And if\nyou\'re very lucky, the ensuing fuss might even throw\nhim out of the running.\nMeanwhile, there\'s the recalcitrant problem of the\nmedia. Headlines and horror stories drive the system.\nEveryone lives in fear of the six o\'clock news. And\nthe Congress\' stock cure for any problem has been to\nadd more to the oversight!\nBy now, for example, I am royally sick of hearing\nthose antique catch-phrases,\n"the $600 toilet seat," the\n"$9,000 coffee maker," or the "spare parts scandal."\nI do not recall a single news account\'s making any\neffort to explain how those supposedly\nshocking price\ntags were forced by the bizarre requirements\nthe system imposes on contractors for allocating G&A expenses. Nor do I recall any news account that talked\nabout the wholly weird requirements\nprocess that\ndirected that the coffee-maker\ncontinue brewing coffee\nat 9 (or was it 12?) Gs--when\nthe crew presumably\nwould be reduced to a bloody paste on the cockpit\nfloor!\nWhat has at long last begun\npolitical phalanx is the fact that\ning just plain unaffordable.\nBy\ngobbles somewhere between 20\nmost recent estimates.\n\nto make a dent in this\nthe system is becomnow, this monster\nto 50 percent by the\n\nSo long as dollars were plentiful, the country\ncould afford that overhead burden and still buy weapons it needed. But as budgets have shrunk in the postCold War world, every dollar devoted to overhead is\na dollar unavailable for buying real weapons systems.\nThe process, in short, is on its way to consuming\nthe product.\nBut remember:\nthis is a profoundly politicized\nsystem that has had nearly a half century to become\ndeeply institutionalized.\nSo it remains to be seen, for\nexample, whether the implementing\nregs for the Acquisition Streamlining\nAct actually embody the spirit\nof the legislation--or\nwhether they are framed to\nmaintain as much of the older structure as possible.\nEarly indications are that the regs are being framed to\npreserve essentially all the older structure.\nNone of the companies I\'ve talked to have seen\nany meaningful reduction in oversight. Indeed, several\nreport instead that there is more oversight.\nThe audit\nand oversight workforce is coming down, but not at\nanything like the rate at which defense spending has\n\nWE\n\nbeen dropped.\nSo what is to be done? The Defense Science\nBoard\'s 1993 Task Force Report on the procurement\nsystem estimated that it would take four to five years\nof sustained political effort to effect any lasting systemic change.\nIs that sort of policy continuity even possible in\nWashington?\nI wouldn\'t want to bet on it. Washington is a town whose political compass can and does\nveer dramatically\nafter every election. Every incoming\nadministration\njunks its predecessor\'s\nfiles. Yesterday\'s hot policy topics are today\'s old news.\nIn my opinion, therefore, reform momentum will\nsurvive only if the issue of affordability\nis kept hot,\nfront and center. Reform for its own sake has never\nbeen able to muster a constituency\nremotely resembling that commanded by the status quo. Only if the\nexisting system is increasingly seen to consume dollars\nthat would otherwise by available for maintaining\nneed\nprograms (or even starting new ones) can it at long\nlast become politically vulnerable.\nThe necessary leadership will have to come from\nall directions: The Clinton White House and the Petty\nPentagon have assertively pursued reform. The previous Congress provided essential support and legislation. But what will this new Republican Congress do?\nRight now, that\'s a pretty murky question. Procurement reform isn\'t part of the Contract With\nAmerica--although\nit probably ought to be! And if\nreduced oversight is to succeed, it will require that the\nCongress allow it to happen. And the Congress has\nbeen historically\nunfriendly to such efforts.\nReportedly,\ntoo, some of the fiercest advocates of\never-increasing\noversight, ousted by the Democratic\ndefeat, have simply crossed the river to take up key\npositions in...\nthe Pentagon!\nFor years now, the procurement\nsystem has provided ambitious congressmen\nwith a rich supply of\nsound bites and political posturing. We know that the\nnew Congress proclaims\nits dedication to budgetary\neconomy. We know it wants to shore up defense\nspending. And we know the oversight burden is taking\na growing bite out of available defense resources.\nStill, it seems unlikely that the Congress will be able\nto resist the eternal political urge to use even an obscure infraction of ambiguous regs as a political stick\nto beat up on the opposition.\nDoing so may actually\ninjure the nation\'s long-term security by setting back\nthe process of reform--but\nif history is any indicator,\nthe lure of political advantage may be too much to\nresist.\nSo, in sum, we\'ve made some gains, but the outlook is looking pretty stormy.\nFurthermore,\nany\nprogress will always be fragile because as soon as\nsomething goes wrong, all the political forces that\nhave collectively built this monster will pounce on the\nproblem as an excuse to reconstitute\nit.\nSo what do we do to tame this dragon? First and\nforemost, we have to bear down hard on the issue of\n\nCAN\n\nACHIEVE\n\nCOMPETITIVE\n\nVISION\n\nWITH ACQUISITION\n\nREALITY\n\naffordability.\nThe Congress and the American public\nmust be made to understand\nthat procurement\nreform\nhas become a national security issue. With budgets\nshrinking, the nation can no longer afford the luxury\nof the un-reformed\nsystem. As unpopular as reform is\nlikely to be to the existing system\'s myriad beneficiaries, the nation\'s present and future safety requires it.\nTo that end, the leadership--in\nboth the Congress\nand the Administration--must\njoin forces to revive and\nmaintain last year\'s nascent momentum for reform.\nThis neither is nor should be a partisan issue. We\'re\ntalking the national interest and the nation\'s security\nhere--and\nthat should concern Republicans\nand Democrats alike, with equal intensity.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.. if reduced oversight is to succeed, it will\nrequire that the Congress allow it to happen.\nAnd the Congress has been historically\nunfriendly to such efforts.\n\nNext, no effort to significantly\nstreamline\naudit\nand oversight is likely to succeed unless it is coupled\nwith effective discipline in the requirements\nprocess.\nThere must be a determined\neffort to eliminate nonvalue-added\nrequirements\nat the RFP and source selection stage. Along with this, people who state nonperformance-related\nrequirements\nmust be convincingly restrained and disciplined.\nProcurement\nand\ncontracting officers must be made aware that in a\nchanged, budget-constrained\nworld, their reputations\nneed to rest on the thinness rather than the thickness\nof contracts.\nNext, the protest process must be rationalized\nto\neliminate the knee-jerk, frivolous or just plain vengeful protest of a legitimate and carefully awarded win.\nThe ensuing delays needlessly waste time, money, and\nresources which neither the government\nnor the contractors can afford.\nAnd somewhere,\nsomehow, the leadership in\nDoD, the White House and the Congress has to put\nsome steel in its spine and stand up to the media for\nits people and its principles. Yes, everyone lives in\nfear of the media, but this mess isn\'t going to be\nimproved by always running scared. Somewhere\nalong\nthe line, we need to stand and deliver.\nWill we succeed? In part, possibly. We may manage to tame the dragon, but I don\'t expect us to slay\nit. Still, every success, even if small, will be welcome. The message of the hour may just be Keep On\nTruckin\'.\nMR. RANDOLPH: Brenda, I\'m really pleased to see\nthat you love the system so well. Our next speaker is\nJoe Zimonis.

Ladies and gentlemen,\n74\n\nJoe Zimonis.\n\nMR. ZIMONIS: I know many of you in the audience\nare working various programs and deals within Russia\nwith various companies. And I\'m here to tell you a\nlittle bit about a relationship that\'s being established\nbetween Pratt & Whitney Space Propulsion and a\ncompany in Russia called NPO Energomash.\nI\'m going to do a little bit of an overview of our\nspace propulsion operations and those of NPO\nEnergomash.\nI\'ll be showing a few organizational\nslides, but look upon the slides macroscopically,\nbecause I want to use them to portray areas of synergism\nand an area where there are complementary\nproducts.\nThen I\'m going to talk a little bit about the potential\nfor the market and business environment,\nat least as I\nknew of it last Friday. A little bit more on the rationale for the relationship\nbetween Pratt & Whitney and\nEnergomash\nand some of the opportunities\nthat we\'re\ncurrently pursuing and our approach to those opportunities. And finally, a very very brief indication of the\nstatus of those programs.\nThis is an organization\nchart that shows United\nTechnologies\n(Fig. AR-1), and what I want to do is\npoint out a few areas because it\'s going to make some\nsense when you see the next chart. Within United\nTechnologies\nwe\'ve got Carrier air conditioning,\nheating, ventilating;\nOtis elevators and people moving; Hamilton Standard with, as space sees it, life\nsupport systems;\nSikorsky with helicopters,\ncommercial gas turbine engines, military gas turbine engines;\nand then a little organization\nhere on the bottom that\nhandles the space propulsion.\nThis next slide shows the type of involvement that\nvarious pieces of the corporation\nhave in Russia (Fig.\nAR-2). If you remember from the previous chart,\nSikorsky with a venture with a helicopter operation in\nRussia, Hamilton Standard with a company involved\nin the environmental\ncontrol systems, Pratt & Whitney\ninvolved with three different companies that work\nwith gas turbine engines. In the industrial area, Otis\nand Carrier with numerous joint ventures in the areas\nof people moving, air conditioning,\nheating and that\ntype of operation. Otis alone has well over 10,000\npeople in Russia at this point in time.\nIf we get back to that little organization\nI showed\nyou on the bottom of the United Technologies\nchart,\nthat\'s the space propulsion operations.\nAnd here we\'re\ntalking about potential joint ventures with Energomash\nand other discussions that are going on with Soyuz\nand operations like Energia.\nIf we take a look at the space propulsion operations, just to put it in context for you, we have sales\nof about $500 million a year, approximately\n3,000\nemployees, and we provide both solid and liquid propulsion systems for a lot of systems that many of you\nare familiar with. Titan, Atlas, the shuttle, both solid\nboosters and liquid and solid upper stages. One thing\nthat you don\'t see is our involvement\nwith large liquid\n\nWE\n\nboosters, and that was one of the major reasons we\nhooked up with Energomash\nand I\'ll get to that here.\nBack in October of 1992, we signed a joint technology marketing license agreement with Energomash\n(Fig. AR-3). The features of that agreement include\nthe potential for the transfer of the licensing agreement into a joint venture and Pratt & Whitney\'s ability to market the NPO Energomash\nproducts and\ntechnologies\nin this country. There is one exclusion in\nthat agreement at this time at least, and that exclusion\ninvolves the use of an Energomash\npropulsion system\non what is now the Lockheed Martin Atlas vehicle.\nA little bit about Energomash\n(Fig. AR-4).\nThey\'ve been in business since about 1929 under\nvarious names. The significance of their operation\nincludes the development\nof over 50 rocket engines\nover a period of time which started then and proceeds\nup to now. They have provided large liquid boosters\nand some small upper stage engines on virtually every\n(used to be) Soviet and current Russian launch. And\nthat\'s where the connection between Pratt & Whitney\nand Energomash\ngets strengthened\nbecause, as I said\nbefore, we have had no experience nor do we produce\nproducts of the large liquid booster type.\nTheir factory, or their primary offices, are located\nin Khimky, a small town just outside of Moscow. At\none point in time, they employed over 9,000 employees. Over the last two or three years that series has\ndwindled, but we really don\'t have access to the exact\nnumber at this point in time.\nIf you walk around the exhibit, you\'ll see various\npictures of some of these vehicles. A number of companies are working with their counterparts\nin Russia to\npotentially provide access to some of these vehicles.\nThe interesting thing is that Energomash\'s\nengines are\non all these vehicles, mostly as large boosters, but in\nthe case of the Zenit vehicle, not only do they have\nthe booster, but they also have the upper second-stage\nengine.\nThis is a little bit about the Energomash\nCorporation, and the reason I show this is to show its similarity to the companies that we work for (Fig. AR-5).\nYou\'ll see production factories, testing areas, various\nother manufacturing\nfacilities scattered around places\nthat used to be the Soviet Union and are now various\ncountries in that part of the world. If you go down\nand look inside the Energomash\noperation again, you\nsee organizations\nthat look like ours (Fig. AR-6). The\nsame type of people doing the same type of jobs. So\nas we began to work with Energomash,\nit became\nvery apparent that there was a good match between\nthe way things are done in this country that could be\ndone synergistically\nand in cooperation\nwith them.\nOne small technical chart (Fig. AR-7).

Even\nthough they\'ve cut back a lot in their launch volume,\nEnergomash\ncontinues to do development.\nAnd one\nparticular engine, the RD170 is the engine that\'s used\non the booster stage of the Zenit and you can see\nwhere it falls in terms of pressure. It\'s a Lox Kerosene engine. The Lox Kerosene development\nin this\ncountry was stopped 20 years ago, and you can see\nthat the F-1 engine falls down in here. Space shuttle\nmain engine is up around the high pressure line, but\nthat engine burns hydrogen as a propellant,\nand it\'s\neasier to operate at high pressures.\n\nWith the potential\n\nnew starts of the programs\n\nthat are on the horizon, we feel we can\nreduce\nadvantage\n\ndevelopment\n\ncosts by taking\n\nof the work that\'s been done in\n\nRussia, provide\n\nperhaps\n\nbetter performance\n\nbased on their better capability\nthe competitiveness\nsystems\n\nand enhance\n\nof the U.S. launch\n\naround the globe.\n\nSo the intent of this is to show that Russians have\ncontinued their development,\nthat they\'ve continued to\nbe in production.\nAs a matter of fact, they intend to\nupgrade that RD170 engine, produce a new model\nwith higher thrust and better performance\neven next\nyear.\nHow do we see a synergism and a relationship\nbetween what we could obtain from the Russians and\nbring into this country? Both the upgrade to the current expendable systems and potentially the reusable\nsystem have a potential use for these engines. It seems\nthe thinking these days goes toward liquid boosters as\nseeing perhaps more cost effective in launches, not\nnecessarily cheaper to develop but perhaps more operable. And with more and more launches potentially on\n76\n\nAR-8\n\nthe horizon, getting the cost down, getting the development cost and the per unit cost down, is important.\nWhy did NPO and Pratt & Whitney form this\npartnership?\nNPO discussed the potential partnership\nwith many companies in this country. It recognized\nthe long-term corporate commitment on the part of\nUTC. It recognized the complementary\nproducts and\nthe fact that both companies had a good worldwide\nreputation and the fact that other parts of the corporation were investing.\nHow do we think this is going to be a benefit\nwithin the United States? With the potential new starts\nof the programs that are on the horizon, we feel we\ncan reduce development\ncosts by taking advantage of\nthe work that\'s been done in Russia, provide perhaps\nbetter performance\nbased on their better capability and\nenhance the competitiveness\nof the U.S. launch systems around the globe.\nThe challenge as we see it is not technical (Fig.\nAR-8). It\'s tied up in business. Energomash\nunderstands what it takes to do business in this country. We\nunderstand the challenges in terms of requirements,\nespecially within the government to be able to have\nengines that we don\'t depend on Russia for and the\nability to do the production in this country. The Russians understand the need, but they understand the fact\nthat they need to make money. We\'re being told by\ntheir minister of defense and their banking institutions\nthat we must form joint ventures, and the joint ventures will be the vehicle for bringing their products\ninto this country.\nSo that\'s kind of a brief overview of one company\'s involvement with another company in Russia, a\ncomparison of the products and capabilities.\nWe see\nthis as a partnership\nfor the future and a capability of\nenhancing the reliability,\noperability,\nand affordability\nof the systems in this country.

I\'d like\nto move on to our next speaker, Mr. Frank Weaver.\nHe was appointed by President Clinton to be the director of the Office of Commercial\nSpace Trans-\n\nWE\n\nportation. And by the way, I\'ve heard a lot, yesterday\nthere was a lot of talk about commercial\npractice as if\ncommercial\npractice was some kind of a magic solution to things. And, of course, as hopefully everyone\nin this room understands,\ncommercial\npractice is just\nplain common sense. And I think hopefully we in the\nDepartment\nof Defense, and I say "we" based on my\npast experience,\nunderstand\ncommon sense and can\npractice that.\nAnyway, Frank Weaver is working that commercial space transportation\nand he is, of course, responsible for promoting the regulation and the growth\nreally of the commercial\nspace transportation\nactivities. He spent a lot of years in the marketing business,\nmarketed over a billion dollars worth of satellites and\nlaunch vehicles. He\'s been published a lot in Satellite\nNews, Space News, and The Washington Post. He\'s\nlisted in Who\'s Who Among Black Americans. He\'s\nheld a lot of positions in industry like in Martin\nMarietta and General Dynamics and a whole lot of\nother corporations.\nHe has a bachelor\'s\ndegree in electrical engineering\nfrom Howard University,\nan MBA\nin marketing from the University of North Carolina at\nChapel Hill, and an honorary doctor of science from\nSaint Augustine College in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nHe\'s a fellow in the American Institute of Aeronautics\nand Astronautics\nand a member of the National Space\nClub, and he served as the secretary of the Washington Space Roundtable.\nLet\'s welcome Frank Weaver.\nMR. WEAVER" Thank you very much for the kind\nintroduction,\nGeneral Randolph. I\'m certainly delighted to be here, and I\'m glad that everyone had a\nchance to stick around. Space is getting to be such a\nserious topic, I thought maybe I\'d lighten it up a little\nbit because, as I was on my way down on the flight, I\npicked up the airline magazine which contained an\narticle about some new terminology.\nHere our topic\ntoday is "We can achieve--or\nwe must\nachieve--competitive\nvision with acquisition reality."\nIn this age of computerization\nand Internet, one\nway that we can change acquisition is to move to the\nInternet and get rid of a lot of the paperwork.\nSo I\nread this list of terms and definitions. Words today\ndon\'t mean the same thing that they used to mean.\nToday when you say "E-mail," it means you\'re going\nto "interface"\nwith someone. If you talk about "net,"\nwell, net used to be something that a person would\njump over at the end of a tennis match. Now it\'s a\nway to jump into the Worldwide\nWeb. Worldwide\nWeb--I just heard that one the other day myself. This\nmagazine article went on to define the Worldwide\nWeb as a conspiracy launched by spiders to take over\nthe planet.\nPlanet--we\'re\nfinally getting to what we\'re all\nabout, space. Right? I think we all understand\nwhat\nspace is. But this article defined space as what every\nrelationship,\ndysfunctional\nor otherwise,\nneeds more\nof.\n\nCAN\n\nACHIEVE\n\nCOMPETITIVE\n\nVISION\n\nWITH\n\nACQUISITION\n\nREALITY\n\nLanguage is changing. But it started to talk about\nterms that you and I are faced with every day. Words\nlike "downsizing."\nWhat does that mean? It means\nlayoffs, according to this article. What about "rightsizing"? Well, that also means layoffs. What about\n"restructuring"?\nThat also means layoffs. "Streamlining"? That means layoffs." "Reinventing"?\nWhat\ndoes that mean? Yes, you caught on. "Outsourcing."\nThose are preemptive layoffs. Why hire someone who\nyou can contract with? There are no benefits, no\nperks, no fuss, no muss.\nAfter you go through all that, you finally come to\nthe word "synergy."\nThat\'s something that I think we\nall understand.\nBut this article defined synergy as the\nmultiple tasks performed by those left after downsizing, rightsizing,\nrestructuring,\nstreamlining,\nreinventing, and outsourcing.\n\nIn this age of computerization\none way that we can change\n\nand Internet,\nacquisition\n\nis to\n\nmove to the Internet and get rid of a lot of the\npaperwork,\n\nOn a more serious note, what does all of that\nmean? It means if we\'re going to make things more\ncompetitive,\nwe\'re going to have to reinvent government. We\'re going to have to restructure things. Does\nit always mean layoffs? No, not necessarily.\nBut synergy, for those of us who are going to be left after we\nfinish reinventing government,\nreinventing the corporation, rightsizing and restructuring,\nmeans we are\ngoing to have the challenge to stay competitive\nand to\ncreate new markets and jobs for those who have been\naffected by the restructuring\nof organizations\nand\nreinventing the way that we do business. That\'s the\nchallenge that people like you and me are fortunate to\nhave.\nHow are we going to reinvent the current acquisition methodologies?\nThere\'s one premise we\'re all\ngoing to have to adopt. In the current budgetary environment, government is unlikely to fully fund the\ncosts of developing the next generation of launch\nsystems. When President Clinton signed the National\nSpace Transportation\nPolicy, he directed the secretaries of Transportation\nand Commerce,\n(and that kind of\nworks its way down to my office in some miraculous\nway), to identify and promote innovative arrangements\nbetween the U.S. government\nand the private sector to\ndevelop new or improved launch systems and infrastructure.\nWell, we\'ve got our task cut out for us, because if\nwe\'re going to do something different, we\'re really\ngoing to have to reinvent something.\nWe can\'t do\nthings the way we used to do them. We\'re going to\nhave to come up with some new kind of partnership,\nand that\'s one of the things I\'m tasked with. I scratch\n77\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nmy head over this task every day. But before trying to\nfigure it out, I thought maybe we should at least talk\nabout some of the recent developments\nand the new\nprospects that are on the horizon.\nDoT is restructuring.\nWhat is that going to mean?\nSecretary Pefia has proposed shifting my office, the\nOffice of Commercial\nSpace Transportation,\nfrom its\ncurrent location in the Office of the Secretary of\nTransportation\ninto the Federal Aviation Administration. But in this case, restructuring\nour office does not\nmean layoffs. Fortunately,\nSecretary Pe_a has recognized that this industry is growing, and over the past\ncouple of years he\'s allowed our office to enjoy some\nmodest increases, both in terms of budget and in\nterms of the number of people. So in this case, restructuring\ndoes not mean layoffs.\n\nIn the current budgetary environment,\ngovernment is unlikely to fully fund the costs\nof developing the next generation of launch\nsystems,\n\nI see some natural synergy in the move of our\noffice into the FAA. But the synergy really comes\nbecause we\'re going to position the Department\nof\nTransportation\nfor the 21st century. If the FAA today\nregulates and certifies aircraft and airports, in the\nfuture the FAA, through my office, will be regulating\nand certifying spacecrafts and spaceports.\nI want to let you know that FAA Administrator\nDavid Hinson and I are both space enthusiasts.\nI view\nthis move with great anticipation,\nand I look forward\nto this being a real positive step for my office.\nAnother recent development.\nWith NASA having\nmade awards to companies to develop the reusable\nlaunch vehicle, my office is going to be involved in\nthe certification\nof this new launch system. That\nmeans that we\'re going to have to work with the companies that have received the awards while they\'re in\nthe design phase, to try to do it right before they ever\nget the hardware built. We want to make sure that we\ndesign safety in, and make sure that we don\'t overregulate, so we can also get the cost down.\nWe also have international\nspace launch agreements. We just signed a new one with China. Now\nRussia has sent in a request for some more consultations and, just recently, we\'ve gotten notice that\nUkraine would like to begin consultations\nto develop a\ntrade launch agreement with them. We have commercial spaceports that are developing in Florida, California, New Mexico, Alaska, and Virginia.\nThis week was historic because the first Leo constellations began deployment\nwith the successful\nlaunch on Orbital Science\'s Pegasus rocket of the first\ntwo Orbcom satellites. This is really an exciting time\nto be in this business. We\'re seeing new markets\n78\n\ndevelop. So this is how we\'re going to get this synergy to get new markets and get those people who\nhave been restructured\nor reinvented out of jobs employed again.\nThis year we\'re also going to witness the first\nlaunch of Lockheed\'s\nlaunch vehicle and, we hope,\nKistler\'s reusable launch vehicle demonstration.\nWe\'re\ngoing to see in the very near term the entry of the\nnew Ariane-5 launch vehicle, aren\'t we, Doug? We\'re\nalso potentially going to see the entry of the Ukraine\nZenit rocket, aren\'t we, Jim? So this is an exciting\ntime for us to witness new entries into the marketplace, but it\'s also going to create some new issues.\nSome of these issues I don\'t have the answers for.\nI only want to throw them out to you today so that\nyou can help me develop the kind of policy and strategy that is going to help our industry become more\ncompetitive.\nWhat\'s going to be the effect on the U.S. launch\nvehicle manufacturing\nbase of U.S. companies marketing foreign launch vehicles? To reduce the costs of\naccess to space in the short term, maybe foreign\nlaunch vehicles should be proposed.\nBut in the long\nterm, what about a reusable launch vehicle? Isn\'t that\nthe most cost effective solution? If it is, how are we\ngoing to finance it? What about these space launch\ntrade agreements? What are we going to do with\nthem?\nWhat are some of the options that are around to\nfinance new launch systems? There is one that I read\nabout, an article in last week\'s Washington Post. I call\nit the Boeing 777 model. Jim, you might want to\nexplore this a little bit more, but the way that I read\nit, the Boeing Company needed to reinvent itself for\nthe 21st century in terms of how it finances, designs,\ntests and markets its products. It also formed multinational consortiums\nto spread the risk and to diversify\nand attract investment.\nAnd it also got its investors to\norder the planes. Maybe if this model worked to develop a 777, maybe it can be used to develop new\nlaunch vehicles.\nWhat about the Ariane model? You didn\'t think I\nwas going to mention that, did you, Doug? The\nAriane model works for them. They got a consortium\nof European governments\nand their respective aerospace companies to fund the development\nof launch\nvehicles. Hmnun, sounds familiar, doesn\'t it? Maybe\nwe should think about that. What about the prospect\nfor a new federal for-profit launch services corporation that provides space launch services to the federal\ngovernment\nand other domestic and foreign customers--a Comsat-like\ncorporation?\nThere are a lot of models that are out there that\nhave worked. Shouldn\'t we start thinking about how\nwe can apply those to developing new launch systems?\nI have a blank sheet of paper, a lot of questions,\nand\nthere are a lot of issues out there. During the\nquestion-and-answer\nperiod, I hope you can help me\nput some words on this paper and give some thought\n\nWE\n\nWhat\'s\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVision:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReality:\n\nA modernized\nEurope\n\nthan\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nsix\n\ndate\n\nELV\n\nbillion\n\nhas\ndollars\n\nsystem\n\nReality:\n\nElements\n\nto\n\ncome\n\nFigure\n\nFace\n\nFace:\n\ncapability.\nten years\n\ndeveloping\n\nfor application\n\nmodernization\n\nELV\nover\n\nspent\n\nthe\n\nof this\n\nof U.S.\nCan\n\nsystem\n\nmost\n\nthis\n\ncould\n\nneeds\n\nmore\n\nand\n\nVISION\n\nWFFH\n\nACQUISITION\n\nREALITY\n\nU.S. Needs\n\nimprovement:\n\nup-to-\n\nbe made\n\nor as safe as it could\n\nthan it need be, and inefficient\n"A/dridge\nReport"1992]\n\nfor\n\nthese\n\n"Although\nthe near-term\nlaunch needs\ngovernment\nare being met, the system\nas reliable\n\ncapabilities.\nvision\n\nCOMPETITIVE\n\n\xc2\xb0"_"_"\n\n-\n\nto U.S.\nELV\n\nACHIEVE\n\nRepeated analyses\nhave concluded\nthat U.S. launch\nsystems and infrastructure\nare in need of major\nand\n\nin the world.\n\navailable\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nU.S.\n\nIt All About?\n\nCAN\n\nof the\nis fragile,\n\nnot\n\nbe, more expensive\nin its operations."\n\n[The\n\ntogether?\n\nrealities\n\nFigure AR-IO\n\nAR-9\n\nto how we\'re going to develop a strategy to make our\nlaunch systems internationally\ncompetitive and reduce\nthe cost of access to space.

It\'s always a\ngreat pleasure to interface with you--or some of those\nother words that you used.\nBut now folks, let\'s hear from Doug Heydon.\nHe\'s the president of Arianespace.\nPrior to that he\nwas the executive vice president and he\'s had a lot of\ngreat assignments\nin our space business: director of\nmarketing at General Dynamics for a number of\nyears, worked for a little company called TRW at one\ntime, and was involved in lots of programs that I had\na little something to do with like the VELA program\nway back in the \'60s and the FleetSatCom\nprogram in\nthe \'70s and the Atlas Centaur and the Shuttle Centaur\nprogram in the "80s.\nDoug has a bachelor of aeronautic engineering\nfrom Renselear Polytech and a master\'s degree from\nStanford University.\nHe served as an electronic technician in the Navy, and we won\'t hold that against\nhim because he actually did some research and development work for the United States Air Force as part\nof the Air Force Reserve. Doug...\nlet\'s welcome\nhim, please.\nMR. ]H[EYDON:Thank you, General Randolph. There\'s\nbeen some effort made to tie people\'s comments to the\ntitles of the panels or the theme of the meeting. I was\noriginally assigned to a different panel, the one tomorrow afternoon entitled, "The world is into space." I\nthink maybe Brian Dailey, being the moderator,\nsaid,\n"Throw him off there," so now I\'m on Randy\'s panel,\n"We Can Achieve Competitive Vision with Acquisition Reality." I don\'t quite know how to deal with\nthat, so I\'m just going to stick with the main title,\nwhich is "Vision and Reality: Face to Face" because I\nthink there\'s some interesting things we can say about\nthat.\nSome of you are probably\n\nold enough\n\nto remem-\n\nber a television show in the black-and-white\nera a\ngeneration ago called, Have Gun Will Travel. As I\nrecall, Richard Boone was the lead actor and he wore\na black hat, but he was a good guy in spite of that. He\nhad a business card he handed out that said, "Have\nGun Will Travel--Wire\nPaladin, San Francisco."\nIt\nwas a pretty good show for its era. It gave me an idea\nfor the theme here, so let\'s see if I can get the next\nchart up and we\'ll see what we can do with that (Fig.\nAR-9).\nThe idea of vision and reality is something that, I\nthink, leads to some interesting conversational\ngambits. First of all, it\'s pretty clear from what many\npeople have said here that the vision of a great many\nof the people in the U.S. is of a modernized\nU.S.\nELV capability. Some of the realities that we can deal\nwith, and that I\'m personally acquainted with, are the\nfact that Europe, through the European Space Agency,\nhas spent over 10 years and well over $6 billion in\ndeveloping a very modern system that Frank referred\nto, the Ariane 5. Another reality, which isn\'t as obvious to many people, is that elements of this system\ncould easily be made available for application to some\nU.S. needs for modernizationing\ncapability.\nSo the question is does this vision and do these\nrealities come together? There have been several analyses made of the difficulties over the years that have\nfaced U.S. launch capabilities.\nI\'ve just put up a\nbunch of them here to refresh your memories.\nThese\nare only some of the more recent ones (Fig. AR-IO).\nThis is from the Aldridge Report in 1992.\nNext one please (Fig. AR-11). The Congressional\nStaff so called Space Launch Oversight Trip Report in\n\'93. The House Armed Services Committee Report\njust last year. These all gave varying views of the\nnature of the difficulty in this country.\nNext one please (Fig. AR-12). I don\'t think the\nessence of those statements can seriously be questioned and, more recently of course, there have been a\ncouple of equally famous studies and reviews, the\nMoorman Panel early last year, and late last year the\nForeign Launch Systems Comparison\nStudy that was\n79\n\n1 ITH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nU.S. Needs\n\n_v\n\n- "..Specifically,\n\nall major\n\nsubstantially\nimprove\noperational-efficiency\nfailed\n\nmiserably."\n\nReport-\n\n"The\n\nin the last 30 years\n\nthe cost-efficiency\nor\nof U.S. access to space\n\n[Space\n\nLaunch\n\nOversight\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nto\n\nrecognizes\n\ninfrastructure,\n\nhave\n\nlaunch\n\nReport.\n\nStates more competitive\n[House Armed Services\n\nstatements\nstudies,\n\n"\'Coglitore Study\'l\nthese views.\n\nU.S.\n\nvehicle\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nreliability,\nand launch system responsiveness\nto better\nmeet operational\nrequirements,\nreduce costs and\nmake the United\nlaunch services."\n\nrecent\n\ncannot\nsuch\n\nModernization\nPlan [The\nForeign Launch Systems\n\nTrip\n\nthe need to improve\n\nexpendable\n\nThe above\n\n,_ More\n\n1993]\n\nCommittee\n\nlaunch\n\nattempts\n\nU.S. Needs\n\n(Cont.)\n\nAppreciation\n\nbe questioned.\nLaunch\n\n"Moorman\nPanel"] and the\nComparison\nStudy [The\n\nhave provided\n\nof these\n\nby the Air Force\n\nseriously\n\nas the Space\n\n(Cont.)\n\nfacts\n\nfurther\n\nhas resulted\n\nto initiate the EELV\n\nconfirmation\n\nof\n\nin the decision\n\nprogram.\n\nin providing\nCommittee\n\nFY 1994]\n\nFigure AR-11\n\nFigure\n\nrun under the aegis of Seb Coglitore. They provided\nsome further amplification,\nI think, of these views.\nAnd I think those were the major dements that led to\nthe appreciation\nof the need for the EELV program.\nOur view is that Ariane 5, or some derivative of\nit, built largely or entirely here in the U.S. and\nlaunched from modernized\nfacilities from U.S. soil\ncould address many of these concerns in the reports\njust cited and could avoid some of the pitfalls that\nhave been encountered\nin some previous efforts. Combining much of this already developed technology on a\nsystem level with the best of U.S. systems and subsystems could provide both lower risk and certainly a\nmore cost-effective\napproach to meeting some of the\npayload requirements.\nIt\'s pretty clear that the government has determined that it can\'t afford the development\nof new\n"clean sheet" ELV. Price estimates vary, but the low\nnumber is $5 billion and numbers of $10 billion have\nbeen thrown about on many occasions.\nSo, under the\ncurrent anticipated fiscal constraints,\nthat\'s too big a\nbullet to bite.\nIt\'s possible that Ariane 5, in the manner that I\'ve\ndescribed, could assist the U.S. in obtaining some\nmodernization.\nAnd the fact that $6 billion, and that\nnumber is a little rubbery because it depends on how\nyou look at the exchange rate which has changed\nrather dramatically\nover the last 10 years, but that\'s a\nfair estimate. Most of the results of that investment\ncould be made available to the U.S. for relatively\nmodest license fees.\nArrangements\nfor production\nand operation in the\nU.S. without very large capital outlays inherent to a\nnew system such as was discussed in the evolving\nALS/NLS/Spacelifter\nera would approach a much\nhigher level of fiscal acceptability.\nAnd the funding\nrequirements\nfor the production facilities would certainly be below new start levels because design and\ncompletion of them have already been executed at\nleast once in Europe. Another way that that process\ncould be fine tuned is through the judicious timing of\nproduction transfer in the U.S., which would allow\n\nthe capital investment to be adjusted as a function of\ntime.\nAriane 5 is a clean sheet design, and it is being\noptimized to provide both inherently very high reliability as well as lower cost per unit weight to orbit.\nAnd I think it\'s fair to say that, taken with the infrastructure, the whole system if you will, is true stateof-the-art technology.\nThey\'re in place, they\'re committed to continuous long-term production.\nWe plan to\nsign the first production lot contracts for 14 Ariane 5s\nfor flights three through 16 about the time of the Air\nShow in Paris in a couple of months. The environment is fairly stable, and the continuation\nof that\nproduction is reasonably well assured.\nI don\'t think that the reliability of supply in any\nsense would be an issue since the choice could be\nmade to produce either here in the U.S. or for some\ncommon elements to continue to procure from Europe. So it\'s possible that one or more variants of\nAriane 5 manufactured\nand launched in the U.S. could\nalso fulfill the understandable\nrequirement\nfor assured\naccess to space. This is more than a buzz word, and\nwe recognize this is something that needs to be taken\ninto account while still maintaining\nsome affordable\ncost targets. And equally importantly,\nthere is no\nevidence that we can see that would cause this proposed approach to bend any laws, regulations,\nor\nexecutive orders that exist today.\nI think there are some significant cost benefits\npotentially possible by considering an approach of this\ntype (Fig. AR-13). The medium or Atlas class payloads could be launched either on a downsized Ariane\n5 derivative or in a dual mode spreading the fixed cost\nover two missions, which we routinely do today in the\ncommercial\nArianespace\npractice with the Ariane 4.\nThe heavier class payloads, we believe, could be\nlaunched for a cost significantly\nbelow those of the\nTitan IV vehicle. And there are already a limited\nnumber of Ariane 5 launches planned in support of the\ninternational\nspace station. With U.S. involvement,\nthese could be expanded to replace some of the more\ncostly shuttle missions.\n\n80\n\nAR-12\n\nWE\n\nKey Benefits\nt\n\nSignificant\ncost benefits\nAriane\n5 approach:\n-\n\nare possible\n\nspreading\n\nHeavy\n\n(Titan\n\nthe fixed\n\nclass)\n\ncosts significantly\n\nFigure\n\n_r_\n\nby adoption\n\ncost of the launch\ndone\n\npayloads\nbelow\n\ntoday\n\nof the\n\nQualification\n\ncould\n\nthose\n\ncould be expanded\nmissions.\n\nbe launched\n\nof Titan\n\nto replace\n\nReality:\noffering\n\nover two\n\nof Ariane\n\nReality:\n\nopportunity\n\nEurope\n\nis ready\n\nalready\nAriane\n\nmany costly\n\nVision:\n\n5\n\ncould\n\nU.S.\n\nAR-13\n\nThere are some other tangible and intangible benefits, too, that I think need to be taken into account.\nHaving redundant systems in two different parts of the\nwestern world would create a true mutual backup\ncapability, I think for the first time in this business.\nThat is, where nearly identical systems were operating\nunder completely different sets of circumstances.\nIt\nthink there\'s clearly a low level of uncertainty concerning availability of the service, and the political\nand financial risk is moderate and discernible.\nAnother benefit that I think would flow both ways\nwould be that any performance\nor process improvements on either side could benefit both, and improve\nthe overall western competitiveness.\nU.S. hardware\nupgrades, for example, mirroring\nthe development\ninvestment by Europe, could be implemented\nat no\ndevelopment\ncost to Europe and reverse the original\nprocess as I\'ve described it. Sharing the development\ncosts in this manner could result in some future high\ntech systems which neither the U.S. nor Europe can\nafford on their own.\nSo this brings us to the question of reality and\nvision today (Fig. AR-14). One of the realities is that\nthe qualification\nof Ariane 5 is virtually complete, the\nfirst flight is less than eight months away scheduled\nfor the end of November of this year. Another reality,\nI think, is that the U.S. is embarking on the EELV\neffort now. My understanding\nis that the RFP is due\nout in about a month. That seems to me to offer a\nvery good opportunity\nfor consideration\nof some creative alternative approaches to the high cost of new\ndevelopment.\nThird reality: Europe is ready and willing to work\nwith the U.S. in a cooperative approach to meeting\nthe needs for a modern U.S. capability. So the vision\nthat I have is the application of Ariane 5 to current\nU.S. needs as just possibly the beginning of a longterm U.S./European\ncooperation\nin improved space\ntransportation.\nThanks very much.\nMR.

Jim leads the Boeing work in the prime\ncontract for NASA and the Air Force in the inertia\nupper stage booster program. He does research and\ndevelopment\nprograms for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.\nHe is responsible\nfor production\nof the U.S. Army\'s Avenger Air Defense System. In\nthe past he has done a lot of work in the engineering\nbusiness on B-47s and B-52s and work on the Apollo\nprogram, directed the design and proposal efforts on\nSchram and air launch cruise missiles, and did a little\nwork in the air launch anti-satellite\nsystem (which I\nhad a little bit to do with).\nJim is an aeronautical\nengineer with a degree from\nPurdue University.\nHe is a member of the American\nAeronautics\nand Astronautics\nand the National Space\nSociety. Please folks, let\'s welcome Jim Noblitt.\nMR. NOBLITr: Thank you, General Randolph.\nIt\'s a\npleasure to be here today. When anyone talks about\nacquisition reality the thing that flashes into my mind\nis the International\nSpace Station program. Perhaps\nthat\'s because I\'ve spent a lot of time thinking about\nthe program the last few years. But more importantly\nit\'s because the program is pioneering\nbasic changes\nin the way NASA does business. And these changes\nare driven by economic and political reality.\nThe first of these changes is the new way of doing\nbusiness. Things like consolidating\nthe NASA program office at Johnson, having a single prime contractor, the use of Integrated Product Teams, streamlined\nprocesses, and a host of other things. Station is the\npathfinder for how NASA programs will be managed\nin the future. A key element in Dan Goldin\'s initiative\nto reinvent NASA.\nThe second change is the international\npartnership\nthat is building the Station and particularly\nRussian\ninvolvement.\nThe Space Station is the largest international scientific project ever undertaken.\nIn fact, the\nStation is so large that it is difficult for a single coun81\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\ntry to afford. International\ncooperation\nmakes real\nsense.\nThe Russian involvement\nis providing an extraordinary opportunity\nfor the East and West to work\ntogether. To put aside our past animosities and join\nforces on a common effort that will benefit the entire\nplanet.\nBut before I talk about that, let me bring you up\nto date on some of last year\'s major events.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 First, after months of detail work, the prime contract has finally been definitized.\nThat\'s important\nbecause it means that we\'ve agreed with NASA on a\ndetailed statement of work, a schedule and a cost. We\nhave a firm plan of what\'s going to be done. It\'s a\ntough and challenging plan, but it\'s doable. And the\nentire team is fully committed to its successful execution.\n\nThe Space Station\nscientific\n\nis the largest international\n\nproject ever undertaken.\n\nIn fact, the\n\nStation is so large that it is difficult for a\nsingle country to afford.\ncooperation\n\nInternational\n\nmakes real sense.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Second is the rapid maturing of the design. Last\nweek in Houston, we held an Incremental\nDesign\nReview where the entire international\nteam went over\nthe configuration\nwith a fine tooth comb. It really\ndrove home to me how far along we are in the process\nand how most earlier concerns have been resolved--things\nlike EVA time and debris protection.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 And finally, we\'re building real hardware, not just\npaper. To illustrate how well we are doing, let me\nshow you a photo and some data.\nNode #2\nThis is a major piece of real hardware--Node\n#2--coming\nout of the welding fixture in Huntsville\nlast week. It\'s 18 feet long, 14 feet in diameter, and\nweighs 5,000 pounds.\nIt is actually a protoflight unit. Its first use will be\nas a structural test article to verify the structural integrity of the design. Later, it\'ll be refurbished\nas Node\n#2 and will fly in 1999. In the photo you can see parts\nof Node #1 on the floor. It will complete welding this\nJune and fly in 1997 as the first U.S. element.\nWith more time I could have bored you to death\nwith hundreds of hardware photos from all the contractors.\nHardware Production\nCurve\nInstead, I\'ll show a chart that is used as an overall\nmetric. It shows that over 30,000 pounds of hardware\nhave already been completed. It also shows that when\nfully operational\nthere will be over 600,000 pounds of\n82\n\nU.S. hardware in orbit. With the international\nelements included, this number grows to 950,000\npounds--slightly\nmore than the maximum gross weight\nof a fully loaded 747 at take-off.\nBut more important,\nit shows that we are somewhat ahead of schedule today. And we are on-budget\ntoday. We take a lot of pride in these two facts. And\nwe are committed to staying on-cost and on-schedule.\nSpace Station\nNow let me turn to what I believe is the single\nmost important factor in making this rather bold commitment come true. And that\'s teamwork.\nIn the past\nthere has often been an adversarial\nrelationship\nbetween the customer and the contractors.\nThere are\nreasons for that, but it\'s proven to be a pretty inefficient and expensive way to do business. It leads to\nduplication,\nmicro management,\nand unnecessary\npaperwork.\nIt slows the decision-making\nprocess and\nstretches out the schedule.\nWe\'ve eliminated much of that on the Space Station. We are using integrated product teams where\neveryone is working together for a common set of\nobjectives. This includes personnel from NASA, Boeing, Rockwell, McDonnell Douglas, the subcontractors, and the international\npartners. We are dedicated\nto operating as a single unit.\nIn this environment\nthe teams are delegated a\ngreat deal of authority. They control almost every\naspect of product design and production.\nAt the same\ntime, they must accept ownership for the quality, cost,\nand schedule of their product. With empowerment\ngoes responsibility\nand accountability.\nInterwoven\nin the team effort are good management practices. Things like planning, cost and schedule control, technical performance\nmanagement,\nproblem identification,\ntracking, and a host of other techniques. Strong program management\ndiscipline is just\nas important and necessary today as ever.\nThe great part is, it\'s really working. The teams\nare stepping up to the ownership challenge. They\'re\nmaking decisions faster, at lower organizational\nlevels, and with less paperwork.\nAnd I\'m convinced the\ndecisions are just as good, or better, than those of the\npast. Things are truly getting done faster, cheaper,\nand better.\nISSA Elements\nThe other major aspect of Space Station I want to\ndiscuss is the international\npartnership.\nWhile the\nUnited States has lead responsibility,\nthe Station Program is truly an international\nundertaking.\nThe Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians have been involved\nfrom very early on and remain full and active participants.\nBut what\'s new and very exciting this year is the\ngrowing level of Russian participation.\nI view it in\nthree parts.\n\nWE\n\nMIR in Orbit from Shuttle\nThe Phase 1 Shuttle-MIR\nflights are presently\nunderway.\nIn this first phase the Station team is primarily an observer and a beneficiary.\nBut what we see\nis very exciting. The recent Shuttle rendezvous with\nMIR was tremendous.\nIt provided a lot of important\ndata on joint operations.\nThe slide on the screen is MIR as viewed from the\nShuttle. At this very moment Norm Thagard is on\nboard MIR. He\'s getting first-hand experience of its\noperations as well as conducting some high value\nexperiments.\nAnd there is a lot more to come.\nWhile in Moscow in late February, I had a chance\nto see the SPECTR module that will fly to MIR in\nMay and the PIRODA module that will fly in November. SPECTR was just being loaded onto a rail car for\nshipment to Biakonour.\nWhile there have been a few\nschedule problems, I\'m told it will be on orbit and\nready to support the Shuttle-MIR\nmission in June.\nThe missions I\'ve mentioned and the ones to follow are allowing us to conduct experiments,\ncheck out\nequipment,\nand verify operational procedures to be\nused on Station. They are the first steps in our cooperative efforts and they are going very well.\n\nCAN\n\ngether\n\nACHIEVE\n\nCOMPETITIVE\n\nto work on a common\n\nwhere everyone\ncommon\npersonnel\nMcDonnell\n\ntogether\n\nfor a\n\nThis includes\n\nfrom NASA, Boeing, Rockwell,\nDouglas,\n\nthe international\n\nthe subcontractors,\n\npartners.\n\nto operating\n\nACQUISITION\n\nREALITY\n\ndream.\n\nTeamwork\nestablish\nmanned\n\nis essential\n\nif we are going to\n\na base on the moon or fly a\n\nmission to it. It just makes good\n\nsense to work together;\n\nto share the\n\nand the benefits.\n\nproduct teams\n\nis working\n\nset of objectives.\n\nWITH\n\nISSA at PMC\nThis final slide shows the International\nSpace\nStation as it will exist in 2002 after assembly is complete. Our vision for Space Station is rapidly becoming reality. I believe that the sort of teamwork taking\nplace between companies and countries on Station can\nserve as a model for future large space ventures.\nTeamwork is essential if we are going to establish a\nbase on the moon or fly a manned mission to it. It just\nmakes good sense to work together; to share the expenses and the benefits. Together we can accomplish\nmuch more, much faster, than we can individually.\nWorking together, our dreams might just be affordable. Thank you.\n\nexpenses\nWe are using integrated\n\nVISION\n\nand\n\nWe are dedicated\n\nMR. RANDOLPH: Thanks a lot, Jim. Well, I\'m neither\na news reporter nor a lawyer, but I really want to\nthank my panel members for staying right on schedule, and you obviously triggered a lot of interest because there are tons of questions. Unfortunately,\nwe\'re not going to be able to get to all of them.\n\nas a single unit.\nQ&A\n\nAt the same time the design of the International\nSpace Station is being finalized. The Russians, as well\nas the other international\npartners, are actively involved in this process. They have a wealth of data and\nexperience that is proving extremely valuable. At last\nweek\'s Interim Design Review, they presented a substantial amount of data and made excellent contributions.\nThe third area is the Functional Energy Block or\nFEB that the U.S. is buying from Russia. The FEB is\nbeing procured by Lockheed from Khrunichev\nunder a\nsubcontract\nfrom Boeing. While in Moscow recently, I\nvisited Khrunichev.\nI\'m pleased to report the FEB\ndesign is progressing\nwell, with a Critical Design\nReview to be held in two weeks.\nI\'m absolutely convinced that this international\ncollaboration\nis paying off. The station we are building will be a better station because of the partnership.\nIt\'ll be a better station than any one country could\nhave done alone.\nI like this photo (not available) because to me it\'s\nsymbolic. It shows two old adversaries\ncoming to-\n\nMR. RANDOLPH: I\'ll start out, Brenda, surprisingly\nenough, with one for you. NASA\'s Lewis and Clarke\nprogram delegated acquisition responsibility\nand oversight for launch services to their contractors,\npermitting release of two- to three-page RFPs, three- to\nfour-page Commercial\nFixed Price proposals, and\nsigned contracts about 30 days later. Is there hope that\nthis approach will be embraced more widely throughout government\nagencies?\n]DR. FORMAN: I\'d say just let us pray. I don\'t\nwhat else I can say, just, everybody pray.\n\nknow\n\nMR. RANI_LPH: This one is for Joe. Do you think\nthat the EPA would allow the firing of a Lox Kerosene engine? It is said that they would never allow an\nF-1 firing now.\nMR. ZIMONIS: I guess the answer to that is, it\npends on what state you might be interested in\nit. The Russians fire that engine in a little town\noutside of Khimky very frequently.\nIn fact, it\'s\n\ndefiring\njust\na 1.7\n83\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nor 1.8 million pound thrust engine fired in an indoor\ntest stand. The exhaust is cleaned up and it\'s silenced.\nThere are ways of doing it. We discussed the possibility at one time of firing an engine of that size at Marshall Space Flight Center and came to the conclusion\nthat the local environmental\nlaws would make it very\ndifficult. So I guess the answer to the question is I\'m\nnot sure. But I believe that if it became significant to\nthis country to fire an engine of that type somewhere,\nI believe we could work out something.\nMR. RANDOLPH: Thanks. Frank, there is a vast supply of tax paid ICBMs and SLBMs that can provide\ncheap access to space for many of the light sats that\nDr. Teller proposes. Why must a taxpayer pay yet\nagain for small launchers while these systems are in\nstockpile? Is current policy justified regarding these\nsurplus systems?\n\ncommercially\nfriendly way, and that\'s what we\'ve\ntried to do with the Arianespace\nmodel.\nMR. RANDOLPH\'- Jim, do you see any opportunity\nfor\nmaking substantial change to the Defense Acquisition\nSystem from the "bottom up"? Is not that where a lot\nof the system costs are driven?\nMR. NOIILII"r: Candidly, I don\'t think you\'ve got\nmuch chance of a bottom up strategy working. I think\na bottom up can do a lot of things to help and make\nthings better, but if you want to make dramatic\nchanges, you\'re going to have to have a top down\ndrive because you\'re going to have to turn over some\nways of doing business, some regulations,\nsome rice\nbowls that exist. I don\'t think you can do that from\nthe bottom. I believe you have to start at the top.\nMR. RANDOLPH: Yeah. Frank, when will the first\nU.S. private space tourists fly into space? Is your\noffice prepared to accommodate\nthis?\n\nDeveloping\nprobably\n\na reusable\n\nlaunch system is\n\ngoing to be the key to getting the\n\ncost down to a point where it is feasible\nindividuals\n\nfor\n\nto afford to fly in space.\n\nMR. WEAVER: Well, the current policy is stated in\nour National Space Transportation\nPolicy that these\nassets should not have an adverse impact on the commercial launch industry. And only under special circumstances could they be used. That was a well\nthought out policy that tried to listen to all of the\nvarious entities involved in this industry. At the present time, that is the policy.\nMR. RANDOLPH: Doug, in your opinion, why has\nArianespace\nsucceeded with a new launch vehicle\nwhile NASA and the Air Force have not?\nMR. HEYDON: It should be said to be correct\n\nthat\n\nArianespace has not yet succeeded with a new launch\nvehicle. The development\nis being sponsored and paid\nfor by the European Space Agency. Arianespace\nwill\ntake over its commercial\noperation after the second\ndemonstration\nflight. I think the simple answer to that\nvery complex question is that the 13 member states of\nthe European Space Agency have made an extended\nand continuing commitment to improve space transportation, and it\'s very similar to the kind of commitment that Mr. Morgan mentioned this morning in\nconnection with EUMETSAT.\nIt is interesting,\nand to\nsome people surprising,\nthat the 13 member states\nhave provided not only the initial commitment but the\nongoing commitment to develop and fund these systems.\nI think that that\'s the first step. The second step in\nterms of success, of course, is using the system in a\n84\n\nMR. WEAVER: My office is certainly prepared to\naccommodate it. I believe the reusable launch vehicle\nis probably going to be the best prospect, and David\nHinson, the current FAA administrator,\nhas already\ntold me he wants to be the first passenger. Developing\na reusable launch system is probably going to be the\nkey to getting the cost down to a point where it is\nfeasible for individuals to afford to fly in space. I\nthink that these new technologies,\nassuming that they\ncan be proven and developed,\nwill certainly make that\npossible. When? Well, that\'s going to depend on the\namount of money we have, and whether we run into\nany snags along the way in developing these technologies. But yes, my office will be involved. We\'re going to start now working with the companies that are\ndesigning these reusable launch systems to try to certify the vehicle. Hopefully this is going to happen in\nmy lifetime.\nMR. RANDOLPIt: Brenda, let\'s try this one. FFRDCs,\nFederally Funded Research and Development\nCenters,\nhave played an important role in the military space\nacquisition and technical oversight business for many\ndecades with an impressive record of success. Given\nthe increasingly\nshrinking dollars available for space\nand defense, do you see the preservation\nand continuation of these centers as a wise investment,\nand perhaps\neven more essential today than in the future?\nDR. FORMAN: We\'ve got some very difficult questions\ncoming in from the audience. This enters the whole\narea of laboratory and base downsizing\nand the whole\narea of government\ninstitutions involved in science\nand tech and engineering.\nIt\'s this very, very difficult\nconflict between the need to maintain skills, core\ncapabilities,\nand industrial and technical base, and the\nproblem of a shrinking budget that is available to\n\nWE\n\nsupport these various institutions.\nAnd so there are\nsome agonizing choices involved of how much talent\ncan you afford to keep when it\'s very difficult to point\nto what the threat is that that talent focused on countering. We need to maintain these skills. The problem\nis, how do we afford them?\nThe FFRDCs are 0nly one instance of the problems that we see hitting in base closure actions, in the\nwhole question of the lab reorganizations\nand consolidations. They\'re caught up in the same political maelstrom. And how it all comes out, I don\'t know. Whatever it is, the pain will be great. And one of these\ndays we will probably discover that somehow or another we saved some of the right skills and somehow\nor other we\'ve lost some of the skills we needed. The\ntrouble is it\'s almost impossible to predict from here\nwhich is which. I guess we\'ll find it when the next\nballoon goes up, sorry to say.\n\nCAN\n\nACHIEVE\n\nCOMPETITIVE\n\nVISION\n\nWITH\n\nMR. HEYDON: I don\'t have all of the numbers directly in my head. I do know that there\'s a very frequently reproduced\nchart that shows the evolution of\ndollars per pound--I\nprefer kilograms--to\norbit and\nthe most recent place I\'ve seen it is a report I happen\nto have in my room. Whoever asked the question, if\nhe approaches\nme afterwards,\nI\'ll be happy to take a\nbusiness card and send him a copy of that chart. It\'s\nappeared in a whole bunch of government reports.\nMR. RANDOLPH: With such a splendid marketing\npitch on Ariane 5, will Arianespace\nsubmit a proposal\nto the EELV RFP?\nMR. HEYDON: Arianespace\ndoes not plan to submit a\nprime proposal for EELV, but we hope that the ideas\npresented here may result in our participation\nwith one\nof the major U.S. bidders. [Note: After submittal of\nthe EELV proposals,\nit was announced in early July\nby Alliant Techsystems\nthat Arianespace\nhad been\nincluded as a member of their team for the EELV\nproposals.]\nMR.\nride\nCan\nmay\n\nRANDOLPH: IS it true that the absolute cost of a\non Ariane 5 is more expensive than Ariane 4?\nwe assume that the cost of a new launch vehicle\nnot reduce the ride costs?\n\nMR. HEYDON: As a matter of fact, our policy during\nthe transition period when both Ariane 4 and Ariane 5\nwill be operating is to charge the same price irrespective of which vehicle is used. After the initial start-up\nphase of Ariane 5 operations,\napproximately\nby the\nend of the decade, we expect the operational\ncosts of\nthe Ariane 5 to be at or below those of Ariane 4, for a\nsignificantly\nhigher payload capability. In other\n\nREALITY\n\nwords, the cost of a ride for a given size and mass of\nsatellite is expected to come down. We therefore think\nthat the new vehicle (Ariane 5) will lower the ride\ncosts and provide much higher reliability in the bargain.\nMR. RANDOLPH: Why on earth would Arianespace\nwant to help put the U.S. into a competitive position\nwith Ariane 5 built in Europe? Is it meant only to\ncapture the U.S. government\nmarket, while allowing\nEuropean-built\nAriane 5 to capture all the commercial\nbusiness?\n\nGetting launch costs down is more than just\na matter of launching\ndoing it not only faster,\n\nmore of them. It\'s\nbut more efficiently,\n\nthan we are currently\nMR. RANDOLPH" O.K., thank you. This one\'s for\nDoug. Please compare the dollars per pound of an\nAriane-5 with existing U.S. launch vehicles.\n\nACQUISITION\n\ndoing it.\n\nMR. HEYDON: As I said in my presentation,\nthere are\nobvious benefits to cooperation\nand the use of already\ndeveloped technology,\nwith the future prospect of\nbroader cooperation\nas well going both ways. In the\nnear term, we view this as one of the few practicable\nways that Europe can participate,\nin any way, in the\nU.S. government\nlaunch business--not\nto capture it,\nbut simply to have some role. There will, of course,\nbe the direct benefits to European industry of working\nwith their U.S. partners and developing relationships,\nnot to mention the licensing fees involved. Last, but\nby no means least, the possibility of a true mutual\nbackup capability of similar or nearly identical systems has tremendous\nappeal. We also do not have any\nrealistic expectation of capturing all the commercial\nbusiness, and we\'ll be mightily pleased if we can\nmaintain a 50-percent share of this market.\nMR.\n\nRANDOLPH:\n\nlaunch of smaller\nlaunch?\n\nHow would Ariane 5 cover the\nsatellites that EELV is required to\n\nMR. HEYDON: It wouldn\'t cover the entire range,\njust as no other system will either. We expect that\nAriane 5 would be particularly\napplicable to the HLV\nend of the EELV range, and as I said, to the intermediate class either through dual launches or by a downsized version of the core stage.\nMR. RANDOLPH: Current Ariane 5 does not support\nthe heaviest U.S. payloads, is not modular in concept,\nand has yet to be proven. Why then should the U.S.\nevolve to a system that would eliminate U.S. launch\nmanufacturing\ncapability and require as much evolving as U.S. systems?\nMR. HEYIK)N: I disagree with most of the assertions\njust made. While it is true that the LEO capability of\n85\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nAriane 5 will initially be limited to about 40,000\npounds and GTO (at 7 degrees) to about 15,000\npounds (roughly 8,300 in GSO), upgrades already in\nwork will increase its performance\nto Titan IV or\nbetter before the HLV version of EELV is slated to be\nneeded. The most erroneous twist on what I\'ve presented is the notion that this would in some way eliminate U.S. manufacturing\ncapability. If some of the\nAriane 5 concepts and designs are incorporated\ninto\nEELV and built in the U.S., I fail to see the danger to\nU.S. capability.\nMR. RANDOLPH: O.K., last one, for Frank. Ariane 4\nis a very cost-efficient\nsystem. Its efficiency is related\nto the heavy utilization of the launch base. If we\nlaunch Titans, Deltas, and Atlases every 21 days, how\nmuch cheaper would our launch costs be?\nMR. WEAVER: Getting launch costs down is more\nthan just a matter of launching more of them. It\'s\ndoing it not only faster, but more efficiently, than we\nare currently doing it. It\'s more than just the rate and\ngetting the numbers of payloads increased. There have\nbeen a lot of studies. I think we know all of the answers. It\'s just now time to apply everything that\nwe\'ve learned and start doing things differently.\nThat\'s what this whole panel was about.\nMR. RANDOLPH: I want tO thank the panel for a superb set of presentations\nthis afternoon.\nMR. PAYNE: I\'d like to thank the session speakers and\nespecially Randy Randolph for putting together and\nmoderating such an informative\nand outstanding\nsession.\nThere\'s one final event today. That\'s the reception\nin the Exhibit Hall. It starts right now. We\'d like to\nthank co-sponsors\nWestinghouse\nand Lockheed Martin\nwith the U.S. Space Foundation\nfor sponsoring the\nevent. It will end at 6:30, and, of course, it\'s in the\nColorado Hall as last night\'s was.\nAs a final reminder, tomorrow kicks off our second day and begins promptly at 8:30 in the morning.\nThe first session will look at National Security Space\nRequirements,\nwhich will be moderated by General\nJoseph Ashy. There will be a keynote address by the\nHonorable Jeffrey Harris.\nAnd remember,\nas you\'re over at the Exhibit Hall,\nto shop at the Space Discovery Store. Thank you, and\nwe\'ll see you tomorrow\nmorning and also at the Exhibit Hall.\nThank you.\n\n86\n\nNATIONAL\n\nNational\n\nSecurity\n\nRequirements\n\nSECURITY\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nin Space\n\nMaster Moderator:\nIntroductions."\n\nDavid L.

Welcome to the second\nday of the United States Space Foundation\'s\n1lth\nNational Space Symposium.\nToday we have another\nexciting agenda, starting with our national security\nrequirements\nin space, moderated by General Joseph\nAshy, with a keynote address by the Honorable Jeffrey\nHarris.\nAnd at lunch, we will have the Honorable\nSheila Widnall, Secretary of the Air Force, and she\nwill address the Symposium.\nFinally this afternoon\'s\nsession will feature a look at the global space efforts\nwith a keynote address by NASA Administrator,\nthe\nHonorable Dan Goldin. This evening we\'ll cap the\nday\'s events with the Space Technology Hall of Fame\nreception and dinner.\nIt is now my great honor and pleasure to introduce\na leader and a champion of the space industry, the\nChairman of the United States Space Foundation,\nGeneral Jim Hill. Please join me in welcoming General Hill.\nGENERAL HILL: Good morning ladies and gentlemen.\nFirst, let me thank TRW Space & Electronics\nGroup\nfor loaning us Dave Payne to be the master moderator\nfor this Symposium.\nHe\'s got a virtually impossible\njob, which he\'s done very superbly so far, and I\'m\nsure will continue to do that. We do thank you, Dave,\nand thank TRW.\nThis morning it\'s my great pleasure to introduce a\ndear friend of mine, General Joe Ashy, to this group.\nHe is the chairman of this panel and will be with you\nall morning.\nJoe Ashy now is three-hatted.\nHe\'s the Commander in Chief of NORAD, Commander\nin\n\nChief of the United States Space Command, and the\nCommander\nof the Air Force Space Command. Joe\nbegan his career as an Air Force officer in 1962,\ngraduating with distinction from Texas A&M University\'s Reserve Officer Training program. General\nAshy has commanded\nboth the U.S. Air Force Tactical\nFighting Weapons Center at Nellis Air Force Base and\nthe United States Air Force Air Training Command.\nPrior to assuming his current position, General Ashy\nwas Commander\nof NATO\'s Allied Air Forces Southern Europe and 16th Air Force, where he commanded\nNATO forces in the Mediterranean\narea and directed\nthe air operation over Bosnia. General Ashy is a command pilot with more than 3,500 flying hours in\nfighter and attack aircraft, including 289 combat missions in Vietnam.\nWith his many decorations\nincluding the Distinguished Service Medal and the Silver Star, General\nAshy is certainly the most qualified to lead this distinguished panel this morning.\nIt\'s a great pleasure for\nme to welcome and introduce General Ashy.\nGENERAL ASHY: Thank you, General Hill, and welcome to everyone. It\'s certainly an honor for me to be\nable to join you today and this distinguished\ngroup\nhere at the table with me. Before I start, I\'d like to\nthank General Hill, Dick MacLeod, and all the people\nwe can\'t personally recognize who\'ve made this week\npossible. I know you have been doing this for a long\ntime. This is my first experience with it, and I am\nextraordinarily\nimpressed. I know you, Dick, and\nGeneral Hill have a lot of unsung heroes who made\n\n87\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nthings happen, and I know you would permit me to\nrecognize some people we have at "Pete" Field in\nU.S. Space Command,\nNORAD and Air Force Space\nCommand Headquarters\nwho helped. So to all of the\nunsung people who made things happen, I\'d like to\nexpress, on behalf of the Foundation,\nour sincere\ngratitude.\nI think our keynote speaker really requires no\nintroduction,\nbut I\'d like to say a few words about him\nbecause he\'s a close personal and professional\ncolleague, and it\'s great to be teamed up with him. We\'re\nreally fortunate to have him here today. Jeffrey Harris\nis the assistant secretary of the Air Force for Space\nand he\'s also director of the National Reconnaissance\nOffice. In that regard, he formulates\na lot of policy\nand promulgates\nit, he does a lot of planning and\nstrategizing.\nHe\'s had a distinguished\ncareer, and I\nthink I\'m qualified to say and declare that he\'s an\nexpert because he is. He\'s from New York. He graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology.\nHe started in the CIA and knows a lot about that business,\nspecifically\nintelligence instrumentation,\nspace technologies and reconnaissance.\nHe\'s advised the director of\nthe CIA in many ways, and he\'s been very integral in\nthe coordination\nprocess, or the interagency process,\nin Washington\nD.C.\nIn a visit the day before yesterday (we have these\noften and I\'m proud of that relationship\nbecause it\'s\nimportant),\nhe said something that was important to\nme and I think important to all of us. He said that he\nproduces products for the war fighter, and at U.S.\nSpace Command and our components\nwe market them.\nThat\'s a profound statement, and I want you to know,\nJeff, I received that message. And I think that it\'s\ntestament to the relationship\nbetween our organizations\nand the team work that we must have, and that we do\nhave in existence, and I\'m very proud of that.\nOur next panelist is a very distinguished\nleader as\nI think you all know. He\'s the acting deputy undersecretary of Defense for Space and we are really fortunate to have him join us here today. Gil Klinger has a\ndistinguished\ncareer; he received a B.A. from State\nUniversity of New York at Albany and a master\'s\nfrom JFK School of Government.\nHe\'s held several\npositions in the Navy Strategic Systems Office, and he\nworked at Rand and made significant contributions\nthere. He\'s held numerous positions in DoD that include the Presidential\nManagement\nInternship, the\nassistant for Strategy Forces and Policy, deputy director of Targeting Strategic Forces Policy, director of\nStrategic Forces Policy, director of Space and Advanced Technology\nStrategy. As I mentioned,\nwe\'re\nvery fortunate he could join us today, and I really\npersonally appreciate that. I\'m looking forward to his\ncomments. I know that he will bring great insight to\nwhat\'s going on on some very key topics of interest to\nthis group, to include perhaps space organization,\nacquisition issues, perhaps something on the Joint\nSpace Management\nBoard and other pertinent topics.\n88\n\nGil, welcome.\nOur next panelist is Admiral Walt Davis. Walt is\nthe director of Space and Electronic Warfare for the\nUnited States Navy. He is originally from North Carolina. He went to Ohio State University and got a "double E" degree and he has had an extraordinary\ncareer.\nHe\'s a Naval aviator and has flown tactical airplanes\nover 3,500 hours to include two combat tours in Vietnam, principally in F-4s and F-14 Tomcats. He\'s also\na test pilot so I know he\'s flown a lot of other airplanes. Walt has commanded\ntwo carrier battle groups.\nThe first was the Forestall, which supported Desert\nStorm over northern Iraq, and then later, the America\nBattle Group. He\'s got a lot of experience in the policy and force integration business, and we\'re really\nfortunate to have him here today.\nLt. General Jay Garner\'s a side kick. I don\'t know\nwhether that\'s good or bad, I think it\'s good and I\nhope he agrees. As you know, Jay commands the\nArmy Space and Strategic Defense Command and in\nthat regard, he is the Army\'s component commander\nto the United States Space Command. I\'m really honored to be teamed up with him.\nLet me just divert here a little bit. Jay has a forward headquarters\nin Colorado Springs, commanded\nby Colonel Paul Semmens. I imagine he\'s out there\nsomewhere,\nbut I\'d just like to acknowledge\nhim because we have a great working relationship\nwith Paul\nand his people and they do great work.\nIn Huntsville, Jay manages the Army\'s Missile\nDefense Research and Technology\nefforts and in that\nregard, he runs and manages organizations\naround the\nworld. He\'s got a lot of irons in the fire, and he\nknows a lot about it. He\'s had a distinguished\ncareer,\ngraduated from Florida State. He\'s had two tours in\nVietnam, he\'s had many tours in the Air Defense\nArtillery business, he\'s a leader and a warrior. Before\nhe assumed his current job, he was the assistant deputy\nchief of staff in the Army for Force Development\nin\nWashington\nD.C. and that was a very important job.\nOur next, last but not least, panelist is Major General Roger DeKok. He is currently our director of\nplans at Air Force Space Command. He has a distinguished career, particularly\nin the Space Operations\nand Space Policy business. He\'s from Wisconsin,\nattended the University of Wisconsin,\nand later attained a master\'s degree from the Air Force Institute\nof Technology.\nEarly in his career, he was in the\nSpace Surveillance\nbusiness and had assignments\naround the world. He\'s been on the Air Staff several\ntimes, he\'s been in the White House as an advisor on\nspace, and he commanded two Space Wings: the first\nat "Pete" Field and when we activated the Space Wing\nout at Falcon, he commanded that Wing.\nTo set the stage, permit me to make a few remarks\nthat perhaps will frame our focus, and our discussions\nand observations,\nas we respond to your questions\nlater. I think appropriately\nour theme, which is "Vision and Reality," will help us to do that. In that re-\n\nNATIONAL\n\ngard, I think there are a lot of visions we ought to\nfocus on, by some very key people, very key leaders,\nand very key organizations.\nExamples are one which I\nthink Secretary Widnail will perhaps comment on\ntoday in her speech, one that she\'s given us in our Air\nForce hat but really applies across the spectrum, and\nthat is support to the war fighter. I think my colleagues up here all will agree that this is a No. 1 priority. So that\'s the vision, support with reliable information to our customers,\nthe warfighters,\nfrom spaceborne assets. The reality is that I think we do a good\njob. We are learning; our learning curve is going up\nrapidly, but we need to do better. And I think we are,\nwith some great contributions\nfrom our components.\nIn testament to that are examples like the Air\nForce Space Warfare Center and the U.S. Space\nCommand\'s\nproposal to the Joint Staff and General\nShalikasvili to stand up a Joint Space Warfare Center.\nWe\'ve established and standardized\nour space support\nteams and I think they are delivering very good products. We\'re getting great feedback. I know Jay has\nhis, our other two components\nhave space support\nteams, and we are also employing them from the Joint\nHeadquarters.\nSo, the vision is to provide reliable,\nunderstandable,\nusable, high-quality\nsupport to the\nwarfighters,\nand the reality is that we\'re making great\nprogress.\nThe next example could be affordable launch;\nthat\'s the vision. Obviously, we need to do better here\nand that\'s what the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) is all about. Talking to our partners in the\ncommercial\nand civil sectors, I think that we can make\ngreat progress here to create a condition whereby our\ncommercial producers,\nmany of whom are in this\nroom, through the competitive\nprocess, can provide us\nhigh-quality,\ntimely, affordable products to get in\nspace more cheaply. That\'s what the EELV requirements document is all about. We\'re making great\nprogress. I would like to express my personal gratitude\nto our partners in industry, in the commercial\nsector\nparticularly,\nfor your cooperation\nin providing us the\nfeedback before we go in final draft on the operational\nrequirements\ndocument. I look forward to making\ngreat progress here, not only for the country but also\nfor the space business.\nThe next vision is missile defense. Our vision is to\nprovide an effective, umbrella protection for U.S.\npersonnel,\nand our allies that are threatened today by\nthe proliferation\nof missiles in theaters of operation.\nI\nknow Jay Garner will join me here and he will probably talk about this, but we\'re making progress here as\nwell. The status from the U.S. Space Command\'s\nperspective\nis that we do a very good job with our\ncurrent DSP system in providing space-born detection\ncapability. If you haven\'t read about it, we have made\ngreat progress because of the work we have done\nthrough our component organizations.\nI\'m talking\nabout the Naval Space Command, the Army Space\nCommand,\nand the Air Force Space Command, by\n\nSECURrI\'Y\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nimproving the warning manipulation\nthrough digital\ncapabilities that DSP gives us through the Tactical\nEvents System. We can do it better and with more\nquality. That\'s the reality. I\'m pleased to report to the\ngroup that we have finalized the requirements\ndocument for SBIR that will eventually replace DSP, and it\nwill have the capability in a very quality way to deliver warning information\nto our theater commanders\nfor all systems that will have to be contended with.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.. modem\n\nbattle space is complicated\n\ndynamic. We must integrate\neffectively\n\nspace-borne\n\nand\n\nand use\n\nassets to deal in\n\nmodern battle space.\n\nIn summary, modern battle space is complicated\nand dynamic. We must integrate and use effectively\nspace-borne\nassets to deal in modern battle space. To\nkeep the advantage, we must control the high ground.\nTo do this effectively, in the cycle of sensing and\ndetecting and feeding back and analyzing and deciding\nand directing and acting, perhaps shooting, and doing\nthat cycle over and over again, we must do this inside\nthe adversary\'s\ncycle. As technology marches on we\nmust realize that it will be available to our adversaries\nas well. We must keep up with our concepts and our\ncapabilities and our abilities to execute, and that\'s\nwhat this Symposium\'s\nall about. And that\'s what our\npartnership\nwith the commercial\nsectors is all about. I\nlook forward to hearing the perspectives\nof our distinguished speakers and panelists.\nJeff Harris knows a lot about this cycle, particularly the first three steps as I described them and probably the others, specifically\ndetection feedback and\nanalyzing. It\'s an honor for me to be able to introduce\nhim today.\nMR. HARRIS: It\'s a real pleasure to be here this\nmorning and have the opportunity\nto address a Symposium like this, because I can look out and see so many\nof you who have dedicated your professional\nlives to\nthe betterment of space. The theme for today is "Vision and Reality." It\'s always a great pleasure to come\nout to where we can interface with our industrial team.\nBecause it\'s the industrial team and the leadership of\nthat industrial team that over the years has just made\nincredible strides in terms of taking the technology that\nwe have developed in the space business and applied it\nto meet the visions of the future. We don\'t talk about\nwhat we\'re going to do. We actually go off and do it.\nMy theme for this morning will be "A Vision of\nthe Future," a vision that combines the needs with the\nprojected availability of technology.\nI\'m lucky because\nmy current responsibilities\ngive me the advantage and\nthe spot where I can help to focus these leading-edge\n\n89\n\n1 ITH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\ntechnologies--technologies\nthat will serve as the basis\nfor cost-effective,\nmission-effective\nuse of space into\nthe next century. This is something we have done very\nwell in the history of military use of space, but we\nnow have technologies\nthat allow us to do it better,\nfaster, and a whole lot cheaper than we\'ve ever done\nbefore. This is just a truly exciting time that we face.\n\nAll of a sudden when you think it\'s safe to go\nback outside,\n\nthe garden variety terrorism\n\nand just plain nut cases, the saran gas attack\nin Tokyo\'s\nmessage\n\nsubway system I think is a\n\nto us all that the new world order is\nanything\n\nbut orderly.\n\nSpace has been an important contributor to our\nnational security effort. Over the last 30 years, the\nUnited States has dominated the use of space in support of our military forces and U.S. foreign policy\ninterests. During these three decades, the United States\nhas developed programs to develop unequaled capabilities to provide intelligence,\nnavigation,\nsurveillance,\nweather, and communications\nfrom space. These systems support our warfighters\nin both peace time and\ncrisis. In the aftermath of the Gulf War, we, our allies, and (particularly),\nour enemy learned how instrumental these space-based\nsystems were to our success.\nEven more important, the lessons we learned from the\nGulf War. The knowledge-base\nof experience provides\nus with real-world\nexamples to further tune and enhance the support that can be made available from\nthese very magical systems that we have all put together.\nA better understanding\nof how we use space will\nallow us to shift from our Cold War-based strategic\nemphasis to a regionally focused model. Key technologies will be instrumental\nto help meet our needs in\nspace systems. These technologies\nwill allow us to\naddress these needs that are ever increasing.\nToday,\nthe rapid advancement\nof technology\nhas redefined the\nterm "obsolete."\nObsolete used to be years, now it\'s\nmonths; and for many people in the business world,\nyou understand\nif you snooze, you lose.\nTechnology\nmoves very quickly. There is a lesson\nthere, even for those of us in government\nwho have\nnot mastered the profit motive and the cold reality of\nwhat the profit motive does in the business place. The\nrecognition\nof obsolescence\nis pretty important. As a\nresult, the reality of what we do in space is measured\nin the time it takes to fund, engineer, build, and integrate new capabilities into existing systems.\nOur challenge for the future is to move quickly so\nwe are able to incorporate and field the most modern\ntechnology quickly. Ted Turner\'s statement,\n"Lead,\nfollow, or get the hell out of the way," is sound ad90\n\nvice for those of us responsible for implementing\nthe\nvisions we now have for space.\nLast year, Admiral Bill Studeman stood before you\nto discuss the role of space in the new world order.\nHe spoke of the transition in the U.S. intelligence\ncommunity as we evolve from focusing on the monolithic threat of soviet expansion, the worldwide\nthreat\nof communism,\nto policing an explosion of smaller\ncrises around the world. I watch every day with fascination, and with some concern, as the world is being\nredefined. Events that once occupied the foreign policy\nback burner are now of increased importance.\nThese\nevents used to be found in the world section of the\nnewspaper. Those events that were there and happening in the world section now occupy the front pages of\nThe New York 7_mes and other major newspapers around the country.\nThe major shift in those events, as they moved\nfrom the world section to the front pages, is these\nsocieties that were relieved from the iron fist of old\nregimes; governments\nthat held back the regional\nstruggles, the differences,\nthe ethnic disparities for\ndecades can now erupt and they are erupting with\nunexpected frequency.\nLet\'s take a look at the last year from a national\nsecurity focus. Without even stretching,\nwe think back\nto the events of Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and all of the\nformer Yugoslavia,\nRwanda (a country where many of\nus had to look in the atlas to figure out where it was),\ncountries in Africa that have been renamed several\ntimes since we studied them in civics. Proliferation\nreared its ugly head in the form of North Korea, one\nof the most isolated countries in the world, and a very\ndifficult foreign policy and incredibly difficult intelligence challenge. The events in Chechnya and the\nstability of the Russian government\nas they sort out\nsome of their internal affairs cause us to pause.\nAll of a sudden when you think it\'s safe to go\nback outside, the garden variety terrorism and just\nplain nut cases, the saran gas attack in Tokyo\'s subway system I think is a message to us all that the new\nworld order is anything but orderly.\nI was trying to look for some term to put this into\nsomething that\'s of value to the Colorado Rockies and\nthe opportunity\nfor us to spend some time together\nhere in the shadow of the mountains and I immediately\nthought of Coors Light. I was reading The New York\n7_mes last Sunday and it had a little contest, for those\nof you who saw it, that said, "Why don\'t you name\nthe era that we live in?" The example I liked the best\nwas that history really names the era that you\'re in,\nthat you really don\'t have the opportunity\nto name the\nseries of events that\'s framing history as it unfolds.\nBut I read past my favorite and found one I thought\nwas applicable to this morning\'s\ntalk. It was suggesting that perhaps now we have the "Cold War Light"\nera.\nI wasn\'t sure when I read the headline that I know\nexactly what that meant. The author who coined the\n\nNATIONAL\n\nterm put it in pretty good perspective to me as we\nthink about the events moving from the world section\nof the newspaper to the front page. She described it as\n"global skirmishes that are morally appalling and\ncomplex but lack a clear embodiment of evil like Hitler or communism."\nNo where in that statement did I\nsay they weren\'t important. They\'re just a whole lot\ndifferent in terms of how we think about this new\nworld than we did when we had some of these clearly\nfocusable, more monolithic threats. This may define\nthe paradox of national security in the coming decades.\nMy conclusion from that, assuming that the U.S.\ncontinues to be a world leader, is that this uncertain\nfuture demands a global, flexible, and responsive\nspace reconnaissance;\nspace intelligence;\nand space\nsystems architecture.\nAs we get to what this future demands of that,\nlet\'s take a look at the evolution of national security in\nspace. As we establish our vision for the future, let\'s\nlook back at the history that brought us here. Events\nof 30 years ago have framed some of the key drivers\nfor military space. Can the experience we\'ve had over\nthe last 30 years help us to define a path into the future? And, is today\'s plan consistent with tomorrow\'s\nreality?\nThe United States National Security space programs grew out of necessity, a necessity to clearly\nunderstand the Soviets military capabilities and our\ndesire as the U.S. to be an active, and I might add\nwinning, participant\nin the space race. The information\ndemands of the missile gap, the bomber gap, and other\nrelated activities could easily be satisfied with the very\nhigh technology U2 aircraft. Clearly, short development high-tech applied against a problem. But May of\n1960 following the shoot down of Gary Powers, the\ncritical need for intelligence demanded an alternative\nsource.\n\nAs President Eisenhower\nsaid at the Paris Summit\nin 1961, "No one wants another Pearl Harbor."\nThis\nmeans we must have the knowledge of military forces\nin preparations\naround the world, especially those\ncapable of massive and surprise attack. That line in\n1961 and that line today says the U.S. and its allies\njust don\'t want to be surprised.\nIf I turn the clock back to May of 1960, and we\nlost the ability to collect information\non the Soviet\nUnion partially with the suspension of overflights by\nthe U2, we are lucky that the country had embarked\non a credible space program in response to the launch\nof Sputnik in 1957. The leaders at the time recognized\nthe importance\nof space technology and put together an\naggressive program. Eisenhower\'s\nunderstanding\nof\nthe need for space supremacy was a catalyst for the\nCORONA program and the Apollo manned space\nprogram. We started with small teams of dedicated\npeople with a great vision. We experienced\na string of\nproblems and, in several cases, disasters, but we built\ntwo highly successful programs that started in the\n\'60s.\n\nSECURITY\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nThe Apollo astronauts were the first men to land\non the moon, and they focused a series of international\nevents in an international\nstage in which the players all\nraced to surpass technological\nbarriers we had never\ncrossed before.\nThis year the intelligence community began to\npublicly take credit for its contribution\nto the Cold\nWar space race with the declassification\nof the CORONA program by Vice President AI Gore on the\n24th of February. For those of you who get Photogrometric Engineering\nand Remote Sensing, the April\n1995 issue has on its cover the declassification\nof some\nof these early images and an article about the history.\n\nThe United States National Security\nprograms\n\ngrew out of necessity,\n\nto clearly understand\ncapabilities\n\nspace\n\na necessity\n\nthe Soviets military\n\nand our desire as the U.S. to be\n\nan active, and I might add winning,\nparticipant\n\nin the space race.\n\nCORONA,\nwhich operated from 1960 to 1972,\nachieved a number of firsts in space and helped set the\nstandards for the manned space program, again focusing the technologies\nto solve problems. The first CORONA was launched on 28 February\n1959. This is a\nprogram where we were postured to launch sometimes\ntwo rockets within a two-week period. We could build\nthe rockets faster than we could build the reconnaissance payloads. What we found was an incredible\ndifficulty in engineering\nall of the different systems\ntogether because we were having spectacular successes. The booster would work fine; we would get\nthe payload on the orbit. Everything would go fine,\nexcept the film capsule would not eject. We would\nlaunch the next one and the rocket wouldn\'t work.\nWe\'d launch the one after that. The rocket would\nwork, the payload would work, but the timing was off\nand the capsule would come down somewhere over the\nnorthern islands of Norway and spawned the popular\nbook Ice Station Zebra, where the Russians and the\nU.S. are fighting over microfilm.\nThose kinds of\nthoughts as we slowly become declassified,\nyou\'ll find\nadd more reality to the story.\nAnd then there was the technology.\nBecause we\nwere operating under a cover of biomedical programs,\non one of our missions we had a biomedical package\nthat had some ice on board. We had carefully designed\nthe payload portion to instrument it. We had temperature and humidity and air pressure and all of that. We\nerected it on top of the rocket and just prior to countdown, the humidity sensors went wild in the payload\nsection. It took a while for the engineers to recognize\nthis was only the mouse that roared on top of the\nhumidity sensors in the launch position underneath the\n91\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMIK_IUM\n\nrocket.\nBy Discoverer\n13, we successfully\nrecovered the\nfirst object from space on 12 August 1960, and in the\nvery next mission we had successfully integrated all of\nthe pieces together. On 18 August 1960 we had the\nfirst-ever image taken in space and recovered by a\ncapsule. The CORONA vision that allowed this country to anticipate its needs so successfully,\nthat the first\nimage over the Soviet airfield from a space-based\nreconnaissance\nsystem was only 109 days after the\nsuspension of overflight by the U2.\n\nWhat the National\n\nSecurity space program\n\ndid was combine the best of the Air Force,\nthe CIA, the Navy and most importantly,\n\nour\n\nindustry partners to get it done and get it\ndone quickly.\n\nHow did we get there? Let\'s look at the component parts: a need, a vision, a leader, resources,\nand\nabove all else, determination\nto get the job done. The\nCORONA pictures guideposts of history will tell the\nstory of the programs success. With the visual confirmation provided by CORONA\'s\nimagery, we could\ntrack hundreds of military targets in denied areas,\nunderstand the Soviet strategic capabilities,\ntrack arms\nsales and activities of Soviet-client\nstates, and ultimately make informed decisions on national security\nmatters, eliminating much of the previous guesswork.\nThe technology\nallowed us to improve imaging\nresolution from eight meters to two meters over the 12\nyears CORONA operated. It provided the first mapping of the Earth from space. It provided the first\nstereo optical data from space. And if that wasn\'t\nenough, it was the first program to succeed with multiple re-entry vehicles in the first reconnaissance\nprogram to fly in excess of 100 missions.\nOver 18 months, we will release more than\n800,000 images representing\nthe success of the CORONA and her sister programs,\nARGON and LANYARD. These images will become available to scientists and historians through the National Archives and\nthe U.S. Geological Survey. For those of you who are\nanxious to get into this trove of data, we will be releasing about 2.1 million feet of film that is now\nstored in 39,000 cans of film.\nWhat are the lessons learned from this program, a\nprogram built by a small number of people in short\ndeadlines? We learned to empower small groups of\npeople with the latitude to make decisions, and sometimes mistakes. People on a mission. People on a\nmission to explore all the options to achieve their goal.\nWhat the National Security space program did was\ncombine the best of the Air Force, the CIA, the Navy\nand most importantly,\nour industry partners to get it\n92\n\ndone and get it done quickly. Staff oversight was\nminimal, field managers were delegated authorities\nunheard of in any other program. Cultural and authoritative barriers were crossed with impunity, all to accomplish an overwhelming\nmission in utmost secrecy.\nOn the 24th of May this year, we will celebrate the\naccomplishment\nof these early space pioneers. The\nNational Space Club and the National Reconnaissance\nOffice are planning a commemoration\nof these early\nSuccesses.\n\nFrom this program and its technology base grew\ntoday\'s security space programs and a myriad of modem technologies\nthat support both civilian and military\nmissions worldwide.\nThese programs formed the genesis of a web of technology that is still growing that\nincludes the Defense Support Program, the Global\nPositioning\nSystem, the Defense Meteorological\nSatellite Program, DSCS, FleetSatCom,\nMilStar, Atlas,\nDelta, Titan, and today\'s generation of reconnaissance\nsatellites.\nThese systems have provided to our national policy\nmakers and our warfighters\ncapabilities such as global\nweather tracking and forecasting,\nworldwide\ninstant\ncommunications,\npinpoint navigation anywhere on the\nglobe, threat warning, and near real-time intelligence\nto users where they need the data to allow them to act\nquickly.\n\nFrom austere and risky beginnings\nago, we\'ve developed\nspace information\n\nthe most enviable\n\nsystems.\n\ncome close to providing\nquality of information\n\n35 years\n\nNo nation can\n\nthe volume and\n\nwe receive from space.\n\nFrom austere and risky beginnings 35 years ago,\nwe\'ve developed the most enviable space information\nsystems. No nation can come close to providing the\nvolume and quality of information\nwe receive from\nspace.\nLet\'s take a few minutes to focus on what\'s driving the future of space and how we should react. Then\nthe fun part, that of the palm reader, the fortune teller,\nthe carnac--you\nknow, the vision thing. Take an envelope up, put it together and figure out where it is\nwe\'re going to be 30 or 40 years from now.\nI\'ve picked a handful of topics on which to focus.\nAs you probably recognize, there are many factors that\nwill affect our view of space into the 21st century.\nHopefully, some of this will spark discussion with the\npanel to follow. We have assembled an awful lot of\nspace expertise in this room to help us exchange and\nhear each other\'s ideas. This forum will be a good\nway for us to hear our ideas of where we are, and\nwhere you think we are going.\n\nNATIONAL\n\nFirst, the needs of our foreign policy have altered\nthe landscape of information\nprocessing dramatically.\nThe national security apparatus used to have a primary\nfocus on a single continent. Policy makers today and\nthe folks who support them--our\nservices--demand\nmuch more information\nfrom more disparate parts of\nthe globe more quickly than ever before. As a result,\nwe have this information\nexplosion,\ninformation that is\nflowing at the multiple terra-byte miles per second.\nTerra-byte miles per second is a new unit to describe moving large amounts of information\nto the\nusers within their timelines--information\ncollected\nfrom a variety of sources, processed, fused, analyzed,\nand delivered on time to ensure its usefulness to the\nuser. In turn, the analysis will be used to assess the\nsituation, have the information\navailable to protect the\nability to act and decide what to do. Whatever option,\npolitical pressure, economic sanctions or military\naction, information gives us the critical edge. Information supremacy may well define the U.S. as a superpower m the 21st century. Information dominance\nin\npolicy, information\ndominance on the battlefield.\nThe rapid advancements\ntaking place in the information arena shows that information grows exponentially. It comes a lot faster, it comes in much greater\nvolumes, it comes from longer distances and it requires a much faster response time. The productivity\nthat we\'re seeing of the modern workforce is directly\nrelated to the number of beepers, cellular phones, fax\nmachines that have all been a trick by our supervisors\nto get us to work 20-22 hours a day. It used to be you\nhit your car, stop at 7-Eleven, have a cup of coffee,\nthink about what you could do this weekend. Now\nyou\'re putting your second and your third car phone\non hold, going back to the trunk to service your fax\nmachine, driving and typing on your laptop computer\nbecause the information\nis coming in much greater\nvolumes and much longer distances. The days of sending an emissary to Paris to negotiate the deal, traveling\nby ship with an occasional letter back to the leadership, are long gone.\nI wonder how many of you saw a recent issue of\nTime, "Welcome to Cyberspace."\nHere a major U.S.\nweekly focuses a whole issue on the electronic information explosion, an explosion that is now considered\npopular culture instead of the fringe. Now, for computer geeks and technogeeks\nlike myself, this is sort of\nexciting when you can pick up one of these weekly\nnewspapers and we can actually have this information\nexplosion being a very popular culture and affecting an\nawful lot of people. The same people who thought\nmicrowave ovens were dangerous because we were\n"nuking" food. Remember grandma with her first\nmicrowave oven? She said, "I\'m not going to put that\nin there because you can\'t cook a baked potato that\nfast." Those same grandmas and grandpas are now\nsigning on to the Internet and they\'re complaining\nabout their sons and daughters because they\'re not\ncoming along fast enough. And their sons and daugh-\n\nSECURITY\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nters are complaining\nabout their sons and daughters\nbecause they\'re coming too fast.\nSend your kid off to school, brand new computer,\nit\'s about spring break: "Hi mom, I need a new upgrade, I need this...I need that." Showing up in the\nworkplace, those of you who provide information\nsystems to your employees. They come in and they\nmake demands unlike any other new employee of 10\nyears ago: "What do you mean we don\'t have this\nkind of connectivity?\nWhat do you mean we don\'t\nhave this kind of information\nprocessing?"\nTry to buy\na GPS receiver during the Gulf War on the commercial market. They were all bought, put in rucksacks\nand taken with them. The Defense Mapping Agency\nhad a whole bunch of really well-informed\ncustomers\ntelling them exactly where every mistake in one of\ntheir conographic\nproducts were, provided in real time\nfrom space. This is great customer feedback.\n\nTerra-byte\n\nmiles per second is a new unit to\n\ndescribe moving large amounts\ninformation\n\ntimelinesminformation\nvariety of sources,\nanalyzed,\n\nof\n\nto the users within their\ncollected from a\nprocessed,\n\nand delivered\n\nits usefulness\n\nfused,\n\non time to ensure\nto the user.\n\nCyberspace--it\nwas coined in the early 1980s by\nWilliam Gibson, a science fiction writer who was\ninspired by watching teenagers hunched over video\narcades. Gibson defined cyberspace in his stories as a\ncomputer-generated\nlandscape of unthinkable\ncomplexity with great warehouses\nand skyscrapers\nof data.\nThis modern fairy tale of 1980 is now this new way of\nconducting business.\nAnd the business is changing things rapidly. My\nbrother, a frequent surfer of the cyberspace,\nremarked\nto me in an E-Mail how strange it seemed to be sending messages in real-time around the world while he\nwas looking out the window at a horse-drawn\ncart in\nHungary. And he thought that was sort of interesting\nin terms of the kinds of information\nexplosion that\'s\ntaken place where some of the countries that are no\nlonger subjected to the environmental\nconditions that\nthey were under the previous leadership are now able\nto jump in to the cyberspace explosion very quickly\nand you can see the difference in how you can get online a whole lot quicker than you can get rid of the\nhorse and buggy.\nThirty-five\nyears ago, how did we connect cyber\nand space? This coining of the word, I think, was\nreally visionary doing because it saw that space was\nsuch an important piece of this revolution.\nThirty-five\nyears ago when we began this National Security space\nbusiness, it was our search for information\nthat built\n93\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSY_IUM\n\nthe foundation of technology for this information\nage.\nSpace was there in the beginning,\nand she\'s just coming into stride now. You\'ve seen nothing yet.\nIf you think about how quickly technology changes\nour lives, we forget the little things like what a pain\ncarbon paper was. But we do remember the big things.\nThe Wright brothers flew in 1903. We landed on the\nmoon in 1969. Sixty-six years. What a spectrum of\ncapability we crossed, if that is an extraordinary\nperiod. If I use that 66 years as a ruler for high-tech\nprogress, and we\'re 35 years into it now, only half\nway there, ladies and gentlemen,\nhold on to your hats.\nThe issue of information\nis how do we translate all\nof this beneficial environment\ninto something our\ncustomer can recognize?\nTen years ago our customers\nwere content with waiting for a lengthy analytical\nreport. Communications\nwere conducted by mail or\nphone. Today, mail isn\'t fast enough, and a phone call\nwon\'t do. You want the information\nbefore the information is available to be sent. You want it delivered\nfaster and better than anyone. We must set the vision,\nestablish the standards,\nand focus the technology.\nWe\nmust execute a strategic plan and carefully execute it\ninstead of jumping on the technology train for an\nunknown destination.\n\nWinning\n\nthe war in the information\n\nU.S. forces potentially\n\nstretched\n\nage with\n\nthin will be\n\npossible because we control the critical\ninformation.\n\nThe value of having complete,\n\naccurate and timely information\nexponentially\n\nwill increase\n\nas we move into the 21st\ncentury.\n\nInformation\nand information\ndominance will play a\nvery important role in every conflict in the future,\nwhether big or small. We need to understand the benefits of having a systematic way to use information\nin\nour military operations.\nNow that we are in the information age, the military will derive their tactics in\nlarge part from the innovative use of information\ntools. Information\nsystems will be combined in such a\nway to create a consistent,\nseamless, situational awareness where information\nis available to the war fighter\non demand. Space will fit into most facets of these\nmilitary operations with communications,\nweather,\nsurveillance,\nnavigation,\nand reconnaissance.\nWinning\nthe war in the information\nage with U.S. forces potentially stretched thin will be possible because we control\nthe critical information.\nThe value of having complete,\naccurate and timely information\nwill increase exponentially as we move into the 21st century.\nMilitary planners coined the "00DA\nloop" to\nexplain the process by which information\nis received,\n94\n\ncomprehended,\nevaluated, and acted upon: Observe,\nOrient, Determine,\nAct. To make this OODA loop\nsuccessful, we must have interoperability\nbetween our\nsystems and between our systems and our allies. We\nneed to merge formerly separate disciplines,\nand we\nhave to master what the manufacturing\nindustry has\nalready begun to master, just in time delivery of the\nright information.\nSpace provides us the necessary edge to make\nOODA a reality. By employing the right communications, we can provide the latest weather over a strike\ntarget, deliver pinpoint navigation information,\npinpoint targets or obtain broad area reconnaissance\nto\ncharacterize the battlefield. Things like unmanned\naerial vehicles will supplement\nspace-based\nassets so\nthe strengths of each allow the military planners to\nunderstand\nwhat it is they can get and the strength of\neach of the parts combined together to make an integrated greater whole.\nTen years ago we recognized\nthe component parts\nof this technology and we delivered these parts as a\nseries of stovepipe systems. Now we recognize the\npower of integration and crossed to main information\nsharing. To provide the necessary solutions, we need\nto press full court and think outside the box. Space\nsystems are only but one part of the cyberspace equation, but how should we, the space community,\nfit in?\nThere\'s nothing new in this next idea. It is one\nthat we all recognize, but it\'s one that we haven\'t quite\nmatured to the stage where we can take full advantage\nof it. We need to focus on an information\nsystem that\nis "demand-pull"\nin which users select what they need,\nthe acceptable response time, and the frequency of the\nrequired data update. The Internet has mastered a\npiece of this on a small scale. As a user, you can\nselect and download data as you wish, converse with\nother users, learn from each other, and query the\nexperts when you need help.\nOur lives have changed. CNN, C-Span, USA Today, Worldwide Webs--all are part of our daily lives.\nWe focus our information\nneeds with new tools for a\nnew age. The National Security information\nsystems\nneed to recognize these tools and our information\nsystems will be a mixture of commercial\nand government systems. The mixture will allow us to balance\ncost, performance\nand, most importantly,\nassured\naccess to data. The demand-pull\nconcept presupposes\na\nlot about the information\nby assuming a substantial\ndatabase of facts which are accurate, enough information to support the needs of the policy makers, the\nCINCs, the Battalion and the Squadron commanders,\na\nrapid response time, a worldwide dissemination\nsystem\nand a secure communications\nnetwork. If we don\'t\nthink this way, and we don\'t think interoperability,\nwe\nwill never achieve our ability to make decisions inside\nof our enemies OODA loop equivalent. If we do, we\nhave a tremendous lever arm to stay out in front.\nLet\'s talk about the commercialization\nof space\nand how that can be a major driver. The mix of corn-\n\nNATIONAL\n\nmercial development\nwith government\nis a tremendous\nlever arm to help us achieve our vision. Today a multitude of commercial\nventures in space are racing to\nachieve bold new innovations.\nVenture capitalists are\nstarting up new companies with big new ideas. The\ninternational\nmarketplace\nhas recognized the advent of\nspace and will field a variety of systems. The commercialization of space is harvesting technologies\nthat\nwere formerly, exclusively used by the government.\nThe government\ninvested in key technologies\nand these\ntechnologies\nare now paying off to a much larger\nvariety of users. This is good. This commercialization\nwill give us an opportunity\nto take advantage, and the\nadvantage is saving money.\nAs I said earlier, some of our needs can be addressed by leasing or purchasing commercial\nspacecraft. It will change our thinking from military satellites for communication\nto satellites for military communications.\nI think we have crossed that barrier with\na flexible, secure worldwide network that allows us to\nprovide our users with tremendous new capabilities.\nAs the government\nexpenditures\nin space continue to\ndecrease, the commercial\nspace marketplace helps to\nkeep factories open and workers employed. The government will continue to have its unique needs and,\ntherefore, uniquely focused technology programs,\nbut\nwe no longer have to carry as long a portion of the\nspace infrastructure\nourselves.\nThe government\nand\nindustry working together as a team in pursuit of common goals is part of the formula for our future successes in space. To do this, we must have a government policy framework that allows U.S. corporations\nto compete fairly in the international\nmarketplace.\nUnfortunately,\nthe government\nmust continue to restrict this marketplace,\nbut this restriction will be\nagreed to upfront and only when very specific national\nsecurity objectives are threatened.\nSolid cooperation\nwith government\nand industry\nwill ensure several advantages to our nation and our\naerospace industry. Commercial\nsales of space systems\ncomponents\nwill keep the necessary industrial base\navailable between military space development\nand\nproduction runs. As satellites last longer and longer,\nand we make more and more capable satellites, the\nfactories have noticed fewer satellites moving through\nthe factories. We need to resize our production capability and take advantage of the lever arm between\nbalancing the government\nand the commercial satellite\nneeds.\nFrom a national security standpoint, we cannot\nstop the proliferation\nof commercial\nspace systems,\nnor should we want to. In the area of space reconnaissance, we have established a policy with Presidential\nDecision Directive 23 on Commercial\nRemote Sensing.\nThis policy can further our national security goals by\nallowing U.S. firms which pioneered space-based\nreconnaissance\nto compete and compete fairly in the\nglobal marketplace.\nRecent activity by several corporations is indicative of this policy\'s success.\n\nSECURITY\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nTo keep up with the changing environment,\nI\nrecommend\nthat we need to change some of our management practices and methods. This is not a new\nproblem, but we need to take on the debilitating effects of supporting an infrastructure\nthat has been left\nunchecked.\n\nThe government\n\nand industry working\n\ntogether as a team in pursuit of common\ngoals is part of the formula\nsuccesses\n\nfor our future\n\nin space.\n\nI\'d like to read to you a letter that was sent in\nAugust of 1812:\n"Gentlemen,\nWhilst marching from Portugal to a position which\ncommands the approach to Madrid and the French\nforces, my officers have been diligently complying\nwith your requests which have been sent by Her\nMajesty\'s ships from London to Lisbon and by dispatch rider to headquarters.\nWe have enumerated our\nsaddles, bridles, tents and tent poles and all matter of\nsundry items for which His Majesty\'s\ngovernment\nholds me accountable.\nI have dispatched reports of the\ncharacter, wit and spleen of every officer. Each item\nand every farthing has been accounted for with two\nregrettable\nexceptions for which I beg your indulgence.\nUnfortunately,\nthe sum of one shilling and nine\npence remains unaccounted\nfor in one infantry battalion\'s petty cash, and there has been an hideous confusion as to the number of jars of raspberry jam issued\nto one calvary regiment during a sand storm in western Spain. This reprehensible\ncarelessness\nmay be\nrelated to the pressure of circumstances\nsince we are at\nwar with France, a fact which may come a bit of a\nsurprise to you gentlemen at White Hall.\nThis brings me to my present purpose, which is to\nrequest elicitation of my instructions from His Majesty\'s government\nso that I may better understand why\nI am dragging an army over these barren plains. I\nconstrue that perforce it must be one or two alternative\nduties as given below. I shall pursue either one with\nmy best ability, but I cannot do both.\n1. To train an army of uniformed British clerks in\nSpain for the benefit of the accountants\nand copy boys\nin London, or perchange\n2. To see that the forces of Napoleon are driven\nout of Spain.\nYour most obedient servant, Wellington"\nNo secret that we need to examine how we do\nbusiness within DoD in our interface to industry. Lots\nof ideas, lots of areas to attack, but one thing we all\n\n95\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nseem to agree on is we need to make the changes and\nmake the changes now.\nI have good news to report. Change is in the wind.\nWe are very fortunate indeed to have Bill Perry, John\nDeutsch and Paul Kaminski, folks who have been on\nboth sides of the government/industry\ncoin and actually see that the future of DoD acquisition requires\nchanges to be made.\n\nOur dependence\nproblems\n\non space, given the\n\nwe are facing, requires that we\n\nensure U.S. access to space for commercial\nand military payloads.\n\nAs I continue my thought to you, let me shift\ngears. It\'s difficult to give a talk to as prestigious a\nspace group like this without discussing the "L" word:\nlaunch. Our dependence\non space, given the problems\nwe are facing, requires that we ensure U.S. access to\nspace for commercial\nand military payloads. The cost\nof launch continues to be a major driver of our overall\nspace systems. In today\'s budget environment,\nwe\nstand to fall into a spiral where we buy fewer and\nfewer satellites which results in fewer and, therefore,\nmore expensive launches, which results in fewer satellites, which results in fewer launches, which results in\nfewer satellites, which results in fewer launches, and\nso on. The last act is, this is the last rocket we have\nand we didn\'t have any payloads because we couldn\'t\nafford it. We\'re going to launch that and we\'ve gotten\nout of the space business. There will not be a future\nunless we act quickly.\nGood news, the DoD now has a plan called the\nEvolved Expendable\nLaunch Vehicle (EELV). The\nplan calls for the development\nand fielding of a family\nof launch vehicles to handle both medium and heavy\npayloads using building block concepts to maximize\nthe number of interchangeable\nparts and, very importantly, reduce the infrastructure\noverhead. In my opinion, enough studies have been run, enough data collected, all the major players agree we don\'t have a\nbetter option on the table. I\'m eager for the plan to\nmove forward from the drawing pad to the launchpad.\nWe are dealing with fixed budget, so we are essentially in a design-to-cost\nsituation. Our requirements,\na\nmission model, will be provided to industry so it can\nharvest technology,\ndefine a plan and help us to drive\nto a more long-term cost-effective\nand reliable launch\nsystem. It\'s anticipated that the stream-lined\nacquisition process will result in a space launch capability\nflexible enough to meet both our commercial\nand our\nnational security needs. If that is not the case, I believe this country will not be able to afford a U.S.\nlaunch infrastructure.\n\n96\n\nSo, where are we? Assured access to space, U.S.\ndeveloped systems which meet our needs, space continues to provide the high ground, a global vantage\npoint, a flexible communications\nhub. The cyberspace\nexplosion is providing us with new capabilities,\na\nwhole new generation of young technogeeks\nto help us\nand a whole new way to accomplish our mission more\neffectively. It is no longer acceptable to provide airmen, sailors and soldiers less than the full advantages\nof our space capabilities to assist them in their tasks. It\nis clear to both commanders\nand troops that significant\nforce enhancement\nand multiplication\ncan occur if we\nintegrate effectively space capabilities into our military\noperations.\nForces that have adequately trained in\nexercise with these important capabilities.\nThe ideas that come forth from conferences such\nas these will be the very things we talk about as history in space conferences 30 years from now. The\nonly difference between plans and reality is time, and\ntime never stops. We have many of the pieces to meet\nthe challenges ahead. We have a tremendous integration challenge. The integration challenge can be sped\nalong with proper organization.\nThe vision of the\nfuture is truly exciting. I encourage everyone not to\njust plan for the future, but to act on it quickly. Thank\nyou.\n\nIt is clear to both commanders\nthat significant\nmultiplication\neffectively\n\nand troops\n\nforce enhancement\n\nand\n\ncan occur if we integrate\n\nspace capabilities\n\ninto our military\n\noperations.\n\nGENERAL ASHY: Thank you, Mr. Harris. That\'s a\ngreat start and a great keynote. We appreciate it. Now\nladies and gentlemen, I\'d like to recognize Mr. Gil\nKlinger.\nMR. KLINGER: What I propose to do is run through\nthree areas, broadly put: where we\'ve been, where we\nare now, where we think we have to go. I have the\nbenefit of being one of the least knowledgeable\npeople\nabout the technical aspects of space in the Department\nof Defense and certainly in this room, which is good\nnews for me and bad news for everybody else, because I just soak up what people like Jeff Harris are\nsaying and feel good when I sort of independently\nhave been working on something that seems to resonate with what I\'ve just heard. I think you\'ll see a lot\nof things here echo some of the things that Jeff has\nsaid.\nI guess in opening, let me give you two or three\nthoughts to think about with regard to National Security space activities in the Department\nof Defense.\nThey are somewhat related to the things you\'ll see\n\nNATIONAL\n\nhere, more related\nlater.\n\n]_EQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nto things we can talk about a bit\n\nThe first is the FY94 House Appropriations\nCommittee Conference Report, which included language in\nit that said, amongst other things, "If the management\nof National Security space activities in the Department\nof Defense is not broken, it is indeed in need of serious repair," which is a fairly blunt but fairly typical\nBob Davis characterization\nof what the Hill thinks\nabout how we were managing space. It is substantially\nin response to criticisms that some of the changes that\nJeff alluded to that we\'ll discuss here have been getting made--the\nbad news.\nThe good news: Iraqi prisoners of war reporting\nthat when our forces and those of the other coalition\nmembers showed up behind them, having executed the\nleft hook, they were thoroughly\nstunned and equally\nunprepared.\nThey had simply assumed that since they\ncouldn\'t navigate through that barren wasteland that\nthey owned in western Iraq, no one else could; therefore, they didn\'t have to worry about it.\nThe next piece of news is both a good news and a\nbad news story. We have gone through three or four\ndifferent programs for the follow-on early warning\nsystem, spent in excess of $2.5 billion, for which we\nhave produced a large amount of technology that we\'re\ngoing to execute right now in the SBIR program that\nJeff alluded to. But at the moment, what we have to\nshow for it (to be somewhat flip) is a long set of viewgraphs. And one of the commitments\nyou have on the\npart of folks like Jeff Harris and General Ashy, the\nother people up here at the dais, and people in this\nroom is to change that for all the reasons that Jeff\narticulated and one even more pressing--that\nwe are\nflatly out of money.\n\nIn the wake of Desert Storm and even before\nit, the good news is everybody\n\nsaw how\n\neffectively we used space. The interesting\nand somewhat bad news is that now\neverybody\n\nSECURITY\n\nwants part of the action,\n\nSo, without all this backdrop, let\'s go to the first\nslide (Fig. NS-1). Basically, where\'d we come from?\nJim Woolsey put it--his characterization\nwas quite\naccurate--that\nwe have come from a world which is\ndominated by one large menacing dragon and we have\ndefeated that dragon. The bad news is that dragon has\nbeen replaced by a garden filled with a bewildering\nvariety of poisonous snakes and boy, is that the truth.\nHistorically,\nour space forces were appropriately\nand\nvery effectively geared toward that single threat, and\nyou can see that described here. You can also see\ntoward the bottom of the viewgraph the change that\nhas occurred, most obviously represented\nby our re-\n\nO\n\nInternational\n\nSecurity\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Historical\nCold War Focus\nand Nuclear Threat\n-\n\n"Inside\n\n-\n\nArms (\'ontrol\n\nthe t_ehw_ly"\n\nSoviet\n\nOnly\n\nASAT\n\n;rod Strategic\n\nMilitary\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 End of Cold\n\nUsers Predominant\n\nReal Threat to U,S.

The interesting and somewhat\nbad news is that now everybody wants part of the\naction. There is a massive explosion and proliferation\nof other countries, corporations,\nconsortia,\nmulti-national, subnational entities who either have access to\nspace products, goods, services and/or indigenous\nsystems. The problem is that not all of those people\nhave our best interests in mind. You\'ll certainly remember all those IBM commercials\nthat depict different vignettes of people in Paris or the nuns walking\ndown the street saying, "I\'m dying to surf the net."\nAll that\'s true. The problem is that somewhere in the\nLibyan desert or in the Bekka Valley, chances are\nsomebody else is also surfing the net. And they are\ngleaning an awful lot of information\nincreasingly\nrelevant and potentially threatening\nin its application.\nWe\nneed to account for that.\nImagine, for instance, the military utility that is\npotentially available from the amount of increasingly\nhigh resolution commercial\nimagery on which will be\n97\n\n11 TH NATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nNew\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nShifts\n\nFocus\n\nof\n\n- Regional\n\nDefense\n\nDefense\n\nChallenges\n\n- Building Forces\nEnvironment\n- Coalition\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFigure\n\nWarfare\n\nMaintaining\nBase\n\nDeclining\n\nStrategy\n\nPlanning\n\nand Threats\n\nfor Uncertain\n\nFuture\n\nSecurity\n\nEmphasized\n\nTechnological\n\nSuperiority\n\nand Industrial\n\nResources\n\nNS-3\n\nSpace\n\nForces\n\nand National\n\nDefense\n\nSpace Systems Provide Force\nMultipliers Increasingly Important for\nSustaining the Overall U.S. Defense\nCapability\nSatisfy Broad Range of Critical\nRequirements for NCA, Combatant\nCommanders, and Operational Forces\nFigure\n\nN$-4\n\nSpace\n\nForces:\n\nKey Characteristics\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Global Coverage, High Readiness,\nIntrusive Forward Presence, Rapid\nResponsiveness,\n\nNon-\n\nFlexibility\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Real-Time and Near-Real-Time Support for\nMilitary Operations Across the Spectrum of\nConflict\nCapability to Collect and Distribute Large\nAmounts of Information\nFigure\n\nN$-5\n\noverlaid a georeference\nprovided by the Wide Area\nAugmentation\nService of GPS that is going to be implemented in the near future by the Department\nof\nTransportation.\nIt is certainly enough to give anyone\npause in light of the kinds of installations that are of\nvalue to us--civil,\ncommercial\nor military. We need to\nfigure out what to do about that, even as we unleash\n98\n\nthe massive capabilities in space provided by some of\nour industrial partners that are represented\nin this\nroom. At the same time there\'s the good news piece to\nit. There are large numbers of potential areas where\nwe can cooperate with foreign countries and provide\nsome leverage to ourselves and to our allies in an era\nof ever-declining\nbudgets.\nWhat\'s happening inside the Pentagon? Pretty\nmuch you can see the major themes here (Fig. NS-3).\nWe don\'t fight alone when we fight and uncertainty\nis\nthe watchword.\nIf one doubts that, and I doubt myself\nthat anyone would, imagine for a moment that if in\nApril of 1989 I would have handed any of you a sheet\nof paper and on it was listed any of the things that\nhave happened in the past six years starting with the\nfall of the Berlin Wall and the breakup of the Soviet\nUnion. I suspect that the first thing that would have\nhappened is I would have gotten a phone call to get\ndrug tested. There might have been more immediate\nand summary action to lift my security clearances.\nIt is\na way of saying, and again, Jeff alluded to this, that if\nanything is certain in this world, it is change. Rest\nassured that whatever we thought was likely to happen\nis probably going to be replaced or added to by something that we never did expect, either good or bad.\nThe punch line for the Department\nof Defense is\nwe get to do all of this adjustment,\nshift this massive\ninfrastructure\nthat Jeff and the others will make reference to in both our classified and unclassified space\nsystems. We are doing not a 180, but a major change\nin azimuth, from focusing on the former Soviet Union\nto focusing on the whole world, and it\'s all happening\nwhile the defense budget is declining at an unprecedented rate. One of the things that we have told the\nCongress, while admitting rightfully that we do have\nsome problems of the type that they have characterized, is, in fact, what I do most of the time or General\nAshy is confronted with doing or what Jeff is, General\nGarner, Admiral Davis, is the single hardest thing for\nany big organization\nto do. That\'s to bring about cultural change. It\'s hard in the private sector and you\'re\nall doing it. Rest assured, it\'s as hard or harder in the\ngovernment.\nWhat does space provide to all this from a national\nsecurity perspective?\nNone of this should be news to\nyou. You can see the kind of leverage you can provide. Even as we draw back our forward-based\ninfrastructures,\nspace provides a nonintrusive\ncapability to\ndo all sorts of things, all of the activities that you\nheard earlier this morning (Fig. NS-4).\nThese are all motherhood\nstatements, but they are\nno less true and no less important, and I can only echo\nwhat Jeff said, that we are, in fact, in the age of information (Fig. NS-5). It\'s a funny thing. Warfare since\nthe time of Sun Tszu has probably really been at its\nheart about the control of information\nas a prerequisite\nto victory, namely, having uninterrupted\naccess to\nwhat you needed and denying the bad guys whatever\nthey needed. It\'s been recognized, however,\nin recent\n\nNATIONAL\n\ntimes as an important thing to do in its own right. And\nsince the world has gotten much smaller and there\'s\nbeen at the same time an explosion of sources of information that has highlighted the importance of space as\na keystone, if you will, of providing the capabilities to\ncollect and transmit and control the flow of information.\nWe used space during the Cold War to monitor\nour arms control agreements;\nwe use it now for the\nsame reason\n(Fig. NS-6). We use it in peacekeeping\noperations.\nBut the bad guys are disadvantaged\nin\nknowing that we are capable of monitoring what\nthey\'re doing, to paraphrase Shakespeare,\nthrough\nmethods that they know not of.\nLet\'s look somewhat at some of the mission areas\nthat Jeff alluded to (\'Fig. NS-7).\nIn terms of launch, I\ncan only echo what he said. It\'s impossible to overstate the importance\nof our providing an uninterrupted,\naffordable access to space, and the way we are geared\ntoward making that happen is through the EELV program. Jeff made appropriate reference to the vertical\nstove piping and lack of integration in a lot of things\nthat we have done historically\nin space. FITAS is the\nFuture Integrated Telemetry Tracking and Control\nSystem. It is an on-going attempt being shepherded\nmost obviously by the Unified Command by General\nAshy\'s people to find a way to take the existing command and control systems (the Air Force Satellite\nControl Network, the Navy equivalent of that) and\nfind some way where we can integrate those systems,\nbreak down the software and hardware barriers to\nhaving an integrated way of doing business, and, in\nfact, expand that out so that civil space users such as\nNASA can also make use of it. It holds the promise\nfor major economies in all sorts of different ways.\nAgain, you\'re all familiar with this slide (Fig. NS8). We take it for granted, but we certainly should not\nin terms of the massive leverage it provides to our\ntroops and airmen and sailors. I make the point that\nthe Department\nalso recognizes that a lot of these\ncapabilities we make use of on a daily basis have\nparallel utility for our commercial\ncustomers and in\nthe civil sphere, not just in space but in all sorts of\nterrestrial\nactivities. GPS is perhaps the best example,\nwhere we are in a situation in which there is probably\na fairly small set of military purposes which are very\ncritical to us, but the Department\nrecognizes the fact\nthat, in stark contrast to that small set, there is a growing set of civil and commercial\napplications for which\nwe need to provide uninterrupted\nGPS service.\nBut the sticking point, obviously, and something\nwe have to work through, is those bad people out in\nthe world that would make use--now\nand in the future-of\nthose same capabilities for purposes that\nwould do harm to ourselves,\nour military forces, our\nnational economic security or that of our allies. And\nthose are the shoals through which we have to negotiate management of an issue such as GPS proliferation.\n\nSpace\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIntegral\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInfluence\n\nSECURITY\n\nForces\n\nElement\n\nAdversary\'s\n\nIN SPACE\n\nand Deterrence\n\nof Overall\n\nDeterrent\n\nRisk\n\nSituational\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n-\n\nGlobal\n\n-\n\nNon-Intrusive\n\nForward\n\n-\n\nEnhancements\n\nPosture\n\nCalculus:\n\nAwareness\n\nto Operational\n\nPresence\nEffectiveness\n\n(Force\n\nMultiplier)\n-\n\nFigure\n\nComparative\n\nNational\n\nAdvantage\n\nNS-6\n\nO\n\nSpace\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAssured\n- EELV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRobust\n\nAccess\n\nSupport\n\nto Space\n\nSatellite\n\nControl\n\n- FITAS\n\nFigure\n\nNS-7\n\nO\n\nSpace\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Surveil\n\nand Monitor\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Deny Adversary\'s\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Design,\n\nDevelop,\n\nSurvivability\n\nFigure\n\nControl\n\nSpace\nUse of Space\n\nand Operate\n\nSystems\nSystems\n\nto Ensure\n\nand Endurance\n\nNS-8\n\nAgain, to the extent that information control is the\nkey to the future success of our military operations in\nspace and one of the keystones above maintaining that\nso-called information\ndominance,\nwe have to be able\nto have a good handle on what\'s going on in space\n(Fig. NS-9).\n\n99\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nForce\n\nEnhancement\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Integrate\n\nand Deliver\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Global,\n\nNear-Real-Time,\n\nNight\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDay/\nTactical\n\nMultidimensional\n\n3D Grid\n\nGeoreference\nStandard\n\nPicture\n\nReference\n\nPositions.\n\nof Battlespace\n\nSystem\n\nActions,\n\nObjectives\n\nto Common\n\nContinuous,\nReal-Time,\nAll Weather,\nNight Navigation/Location/Timing\n-\n\nFigure\n\nSurveillance,\n\nBDA\n\nDynamic\n\nGlobal\n\nAll Weather,\n\nReconnaissance,\n\nWarning,\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nC4I\n\nNear-Zero\nCEPs Minimize\nAchieve High Pk\n\nLevel\n\nof Force\n\nDay/\n\nRequired\n\nto\n\nNS-9\n\nPotential\n\nFuture\n\nDirections\n\nSpace\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Recognize\nChanges\nEnvironment\nCoverage\n\n-\n\nRecognize\nPotential Benefits and Threats\nSpace Systems.\nProducts, Services\n\n-\n\nDirect\n\n-\n\nCritical\n\nwith Emphasis\n\nSpace Forces\nStructure\n\nSupport\nto U.S.\n\nGENERAL ASHY: Thank you, Mr. Klinger.\npanelist will be Walt Davis.\n\nto International\n\nGk,bal\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Incorporate\nDoD Force\n\nfor DoD\n\nPolicy\n\n-\n\non Tactical\n\nApplications\n\nfrom\n\nSpread\n\ninto Mainstream\n\nDominance\n\nof\n\nof\n\nin Peacetime,\n\nCrisis,\n\nand Conflict\n\nFigure\n\nNS-IO\n\nSo what\'s happening in terms of a policy perspective? You\'ll see here (Fig. NS-IO), I\'m going to leave\naside any discussion about organizational\nchanges, and\nI\'ll be happy to try and address that during questions\nand answers. Strictly from a policy standpoint, I want\nto give you a sense of what kind of things we\'re looking to overhaul the existing Department\nof Defense\nSpace Policy. You can see those listed here. Again,\nwe have done an exemplary job of moving and changing on the fly. Both the NRO and our other classified\nspace activities and all of our unclassified\nspace activities have done an astounding job of changing direction\nin response to real time changes in the world. As good\nas we\'ve gotten, we continue to emphasize the need to\ndo better. The problem, put bluntly, is, in my personal\nestimation, that the next time we have a Desert Shield\nand a Desert Storm (My personal opinion is it is simply a matter of time before someone miscalculates\nAmerican resolve and that of our allies and tries something like it.), the next time we will not have somebody as dumb as Saddam Hussein was to sit there for\nsix months and let us go to spring training, to bring in\nforces and to fix the problems that we discover in a\nbenign environment.\nWe will have to fight our way in\n100\n\nOur next\n\nSecurity\n\nfor Warfighters\nInformation\n\nin a fairly hostile environment.\nThat is not the time to\nfind out whatever the warfare area involved, that we\nshould have fixed our problems.\nIt places heavy emphasis on the need for us to arrest those difficulties\nright now.\nThis last slide is perhaps the perfect lead-in to a\ntheme that Jeff alluded to--we\'ve\ngot to break down\nthe wall (Fig. NS-11). We spend way too much time\nin the Department\nof Defense arguing over who ought\nto be doing things in space instead of deciding what\nwe should do and how we should do it. Let me assert\nmy personal opinion that if you answered the last two\nquestions, the answer to the first would become selfevident. We need to do a better job of that and are\nworking hard to do it. I think you\'ll hear some of that\ntoday.\nThat\'s pretty much all we have to say. I look\nforward to trying to answer your questions. Thanks.\n\nADMIRAL DAVIS: As you might imagine, I\'m delighted to be here in Colorado Springs from Washington. I will give you the Navy\'s perspective\non space\nsupport as it relates to the maritime warfighter.\nI will\nalso talk a little bit about where we are, how we are\ntoday, and where we\'re headed tomorrow.\nI\'ve got three things I\'d like to do here. First, I\nwant to let you see how we see ourselves and our\ngoals. Second, review three or four examples of capabilities developed and innovation in those developments. And then I\'ll solicit your ideas for future innovations.\nFor over 200 years, Navy and Marine Corps have\nprovided forces to influence events overseas. National\nsecurity and national strategies for a Navy that is positioned to deter crisis, respond to crisis when deterrence fails and transition to war as required. Forward\npresence is the essence of our business.\nFor the Navy\nand the Marine Corps team to execute its national\nmission, we must be on the scene with the ability to\nsustain our actions for as long as should be necessary.\nWe must be forward, now and in the future. A maritime force that is globally deployed and broadly dispersed relies heavily on communications.\nWe have\nleveraged communications\nthroughout our history,\nfrom flag signals to radio waves to radar satellites.\nThe Navy has stood, by necessity, at the forefront of\nevery evolutionary\ndevelopment\nin telecommunications.\nToday we look to space systems for a wide range\nof force enhancement\nfunctions. We see space as a\nmedium for space exploitation by the warfighter,\nnot\nas some fourth dimension of the battlefield or as a\nmission in and of itself. It is a medium of connectivity. So we have integrated space into every facet of\nour maritime operations.\nTo measure weather conditions, to navigate the oceans, to conduct surveillance\n\nNATIONAL\n\nand obtain intelligence worldwide, and to communicate\nboth openly and securely to exploit real and potential\nthreats.\nThe end of the Cold War, however, has fundamentally altered the focus of National Security Space activities. Systems designed in response to the threat posed\nin the past by the Soviet Union are now providing data\npoints for decisions in Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti and a\nhost of other areas. The top of the national space\nestablishment\nhas become supportive of military operations, as you heard earlier this morning. Operations\nheavily relied on forward deployed global naval forces\nas demonstrated\nso convincingly\nin the Gulf War.\nSpace support to tactical operations is now an essential\nelement of our ability to wage war.\nDefense spending is down across the board, over\n40 percent overall and 60 percent in procurement\naccounts alone. The magnitude of these changes presents us with a clear mandate to streamline processes\nfor maximum efficiency as we prepare to bring the\nnext generation of space system for warfighting support on line. This mandate is entirely in keeping with\nboth the Reinventing\nGovernment\nInitiative and the\nFederal Acquisition Streamlining\nAct of 1994.\n\nThe Navy has stood,\nforefront\n\nby necessity, at the\n\nof every evolutionary development\nin telecommunications.\n\nIt is most recently reflected in the decision of the\ndeputy undersecretary\nof defense to stand up a deputy\nundersecretary\nof space within the Office of the\nUndersecretary\nof Space for Acquisition and Technology. Today all of the services are working with this\nnew deputy undersecretary\nof defense for space to\nmark a path towards the goal that Congress has placed\nbefore us--the unified management\nof defense and\nnational intelligence space activities.\nThe Navy believes in doing things faster, cheaper,\nand better through a lean infrastructure\nwhich makes\nfull use of the commercial\nsector. Tomorrow\'s\nspace\nmanagement\nwill require a joint and integrated forum\nwhere all the national security space partners not only\nvoice their requirements\nbut also play an active and\nmeaningful role in the satisfaction of those requirements. In this way, we will avoid a process where, as\nMrs. Slatkin says, "Decisions\nare measured with a\nmicrometer,\nmarked with chalk and then cut with an\nax._\n\nDone properly, we will find ourselves with a lean\norganization,\nstreamlined\nacquisition processes delivering affordable space systems quickly and efficiently,\nmaking full use of technology injection, innovation,\nand the best of the commercial\nworld. The Navy has\nalready started down that path.\n\nSECURrrY\n\nFuture\nNeed\n\nREQUIRFAdFAcrs\n\nDirections\n\nfor Improved\n\nIntegration\n\nIN SPACE\n\n(Cont.)\nin Space\n\nSystems\n-\n\nExtensive\n\nDevelopment,\n-\n\nEarlier/More\n\nDesign,\n\nUse of Commercial\n\nUser lnvoh,ement\n\nin Space\n\nSystems\'\n\nAcquisilion\n\nPractices\n\nand Systems,\n\nas Appropriate\n\n--\n\nCivil and Foreign\n-\n\nUlilize\n\nDomestic/Foreign\n\nSystems\n-\n\nLook Across\nClassified\n\n-\n\nStreamline\n\nCivil,\n\nCommercial,\n\nand Consortia\n\nand Services\nMissions,\n\nAcquisition\n\nArchitectures\n\nSyslems,\n\nand Unclassified\n\n-- Include\n\nSystems\n\nof Systems\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Focus on Affordability\nand Requirements:\nEverything\nin the Tradespace\nFigure\n\nNS-11\n\nUHF follow-on is a particularly\ngood example. It\nembodies straight-forward\nfunctional specifications\nbased on existing commercial technologies\neliminating\nthe cost of R&D and UFO\'s firm fixed price bill and\nthe watch contract calls for delivery of that capability\non orbit. We\'ve done that for less than $200 million\nper satellite. Our nation receives these operational\nsatellites while the contractor who has built them provides a commercial bus that promises to set a new\nworld standard for communication\nsatellites. This\nprogram is executed from the program office of only\n16 people, yet enough flexibility by the way, and I\nthink that\'s important,\nto add EHF capability to the\nlast seven satellites without a missed step. We\'re now\nconsidering the addition of direct broadcast capability\nto the last UFO satellite. As you know direct broadcast, this technology will reduce to the man on existing two-way interoperable\ncommunications\nby providing multicharmel,\none-way, high-speed transmission\nof\nlarge data updates as well as high-quality\nimagery\nfrom ashore-to-afloat\nforces.\nOur environment\nsatellite is much the same. The\nGEOSAT follow-on satellite program has this same\nmodel. A four-man program office contracting for a\nsmall satellite on orbit capability under a functional\nspecification using commercial\nstandards and practices.\nIt\'s now scheduled for a 1996 launch, and it\'s on\nschedule and on budget.\nChallenge Athena. Throughout\nlast Fall\'s sixmonth deployment\nof the USS GEORGE WASHINGTON Battle Group, Navy\'s project Challenge Athena\nproved the feasibility of timely delivery of primary\nimagery to the afloat tactical warfighter.\nIn the words\nof the Battle Group Commander,\nthis link changed the\nvery complexion of Battle Group operations.\nWhat does it do? Challenge Athena allows us to\ndeliver over 6,500 national images to the warfighter.\nBy the way, in time frames as low as seven minutes\nthe picture\'s taken out to the warfighter\naboard\nship--full\naccess to the national intelligence data\nbases--use\nof 32 phone lines terminating\nin CONUS\n(Continental United States). Telemedicine,\nwhich\n101\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nassisted during that deployment\nin 105 consultations,\neliminated the need for 31 medical evacuations\nand\nassisted in the diagnosis of five suspected cancer cases.\nNow we\'re looking at Challenge Athena which\nwill deploy with the Carl Vinson Battle Group next\nyear, providing high-volume\ndata to three joint task\nforce groups at 12 times the data rate currently available in our forces today. And it will demonstrate\ninitiatives for inter and intra Battle Group networking,\nassistance to shooter links and video teleconferencing,\nand JDISS connectivity.\nI\'ve got several other examples that I could talk\nabout, but I\'m going to skip some of those and go to\none other technology I think is going to be very important to us, and that is this simulation-based\ndesign.\nRecent ship\'s design work by ARPA, the commercially produced 777, and other projects attest to the\npotential value of this new technology.\nModeling &\nSimulation will let us build new, complex platforms\nand systems faster, better, and more error-free,\nas we\ndo all the preliminary\ndesign and tests work in a computer environment\nand help us get the real thing out to\nthe warfighter\nat a lower cost.\nAs we move towards integrated management\nfor\nNational Security Space systems, we must ensure that\nthe field remains wide open, in our opinion, to give\nincentive for competitive\ninnovation.\nEach service and\neach agency has something to bring to the table. Navy\nexpects to lead and not just play where our primary\ninterest lie. We have long recognized the value of\nspace to the afloat warfighter.\nAfter all, it was for this\npurpose that we established the Naval Observatory\nin\n1844.\nWe are in the midst of a time of significant change\nthat is no less revolutionary\nthan the advent of steam\npropulsion,\ncarrier aviation or nuclear submarines.\nThe so-called revolution in military affairs has moved\ninformation\nand the requirement\nfor information dominance to center stage in our thinking about modern\nwarfare. Successful implementation\nof these innovations requires that they be integrated into our doctrine,\nour strategy, and our systems. We must cross that\nthreshold now.\nWe like your theme because we do truly believe\nthat tomorrow\'s\nreality can be brighter than today\'s\nvision. In fact, if we look at today\'s reality of yesterday\'s vision, we\'ve found that we, in fact, have already been able to do that. So for a swift ship and a\ntrim crew, we\'ll have the tools that they need to maneuver any challenge that may await. This is what we\ncall the way ahead.\nThank you very much.\nGENERAL ASHY:\nner.\n\n102\n\nThanks\n\nWalt.\n\nThis guy\'s\n\nJay Gar-\n\nGENERAL GARNER: Thank you, Sir. I\'ve got a dozen\nslides and I\'m going to cover them in about that many\nminutes (slides not available). What I want to do is\nsort of focus on what a small Army does in the 21st\ncentury that\'s CONUS-based\nand how it goes out and\nfights and what poles it needs from space to do this.\nPut the first slide on.\nI think General Rosenberg had it right. What that\nslide says highlights a statement Gil Klinger made\nwhen he said, "Hey, what we need to do is quit worrying about who does what and figure out how we\'re\ngoing to fight in the future, what we need from space,\nand all the rest of that stuff will fall in place." That\'s\nwhat I want to talk to you, and how the Army\'s going\nto have to fight in the future. Put the next one on\nplease.\nThe military strategy says O.K., you\'ve got to go\nout and win decisively. You have to do that because\nthat\'s what we want to do, plus as you noticed on the\nslide before, talked about coalition warfare. Coalitions\ndon\'t hang together very long, so you need to get in\nthere and do your business and get out. We have to do\nit with minimum casualties because we don\'t like to\ntake casualties, No. 1 and No. 2, because of the political pressures it brings upon us. So the Army of the\nfuture is going to be required to project its force. Once\nyou\'ve projected it, you\'ve got to protect it. Once you\nhave it in place, you have to be able to control it. And\nfor the land warfare guys, you\'ve got to maneuver and\nbe able to kill the enemy. Put the next one on, please.\nSo what do you need from space to do that? Look\nat the environment\nover there. Deployments\nare going\nto be forward based. That means we\'ve got a small\narmy. We\'ve got to get it there and in order to project it we\'ve got to do split-base operations.\nWe\'ve got\nto do absolute Intelligent Preparation\nof the Battlefield\n(IPB) before it starts and en route. Smaller forces are\ngoing to require that we absolutely have leak-proof\ndefenses. We\'ve got to be able to challenge enemy\nmissiles throughout their life cycle. From building\nthem in the factory, throughout the infrastructure,\nall\nthe way to finding when they\'re placed on the ground\nto killing them in every phase of their launch once the\ntrigger\'s pulled--boost,\nascent, and terminal. And it\nhas to be leak-proof.\nInformation-based\nwarfare, Jeff talked about that a\nlot. We\'ve got to control the force. We\'ve got to have\nabsolute situation awareness across the boards, across\nall services, and where that really gets difficult is\nwhen you\'re dealing with coalitions.\nHell, we can\'t\neven do it among ourselves right now. We\'ve got to\nhave real-time intelligence,\nand for the Army and the\nMarine Corps, we\'re now engaged in digitizing our\nbattlefield. And that also brings big problems when\nyou deal with coalitions. And then we have to have\nincreased operational\ntempo. The way we win is doing\nthings inside the other guy\'s decision cycle. Having an\n\nNATIONAL\n\noperational tempo that\'s so overwhelming\nthat he can\'t\nrespond to it. In order to do that you\'ve got to know\nyour environment.\nBlue force tracking; you\'ve got to\nknow the enemy.\nRed force tracking; you\'ve got to\nhave common situation awareness across the joint\nforce. Next slide, please.\nSo what do you get out of space? We\'ve got splitbased operations.\nYou\'ve got to always have Intelligence Preparation\nof the Battlefield even on the move.\nYou\'ve got to have global communications\nto look on\nthe righthand side of that. You\'ve got to have longhaul comms. You really have to be able to do mission\nrehearsals,\nvirtual rehearsals,\nbefore you get there. No\nsoldier, sailor, marine, or airman ought to get in theater in the future with a blank sheet of paper. He\'ll\nhave already been rehearsed through it at home station\nagainst the weapons he\'s going to face. Long-haul\nsatellite comms, absolute mapping. Next slide, please.\nAs we project that force, over on the left that\'s\nkind of the stuff we do right now. We do a fair job of\nmission planning and rehearsal systems, a fair job of\nmulti-spectral\nimaging. We dig up pretty good TENCAP systems. But we need to go in the future with\nbetter jobs on weather, man portable UHF, enhanced\nGPS, down to about one meter resolution,\nand then all\nthe way to where we have GPS follow-ons,\nSatCom\npaging, laser tracking. That\'s how we\'ll do it in the\nfuture. Next slide, please.\nHow do you protect that force? We\'ve got to have\nabsolute threat warning. We\'ve got to know exactly\nwhen launch occurs, where it occurred from, and\nwhere it\'s going to impact so we can whittle that down\nto the unit that\'s going to be impacted. And we need\nprecise targeting where the launcher was when it fired\nso we can kill that launcher where he can never fire\nagain. Flawless missile defense that is leak proof,\ncommon situation awareness,\nand minimum casualties.\nI\'ll hitchhike on what Walt said on telemedicine.\nIn the future, we have to be able to have our medics in\nthe battlefield hook up the wounded soldier or the\nmarine; have that piped back to the experts, maybe at\nWalter Reed; and have that subject matter expert save\nthat soldier or marine\'s life. And we\'ll be able to do\nthat in the 21st century, but it\'s going to take space to\ndo that. Next slide, please.\nToday we do a pretty good job of warning, but we\nhave to do a lot better. We\'re beginning to get into\ntelemedicine.\nWe\'re getting into battle management\nwhere we fuse together all phases of the theater missile\ndefense battle, the attack operations, the air defense\npiece, passive operations to deal with bio-chem, nuclear, and then have the battle management\nsystem tie\nall that together in a synergistic effect. Take all the\ngreat TENCAP products we have on all these huge\ntrailers, trucks and everything;\nshrink it down to about\nsix humvees, where we have better capability, much\nsmaller force able to project it; and then go into these\nthings in the future. Especially in chem and bio detection on the battlefield. Next slide, please.\n\nSECURITY\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nNow how do we control the force when we get it\nthere? Again, we have to have a common situation\nawareness,\nand that\'s across the force. I\'m not talking\nabout CINC to CINC. I\'m talking about soldier to\nsoldier, tank to tank, Bradley to Bradley, aircraft to\naircraft. Absolute navigation on every one of our\nplatforms. GPS on every platform, to every soldier,\nevery truck driver, everybody ought to know where he\nis, where he\'s going, where he\'s got to be. He ought\nto have common situation awareness with the force,\nand we do that with real-time intelligence.\nAnd on the\nright, you see how we get that from space.\n\nWe\'re getting\n\ninto battle management\n\nwhere\n\nwe fuse together all phases of the theater\nmissile defense battle, the attack operations,\nthe air defense piece, passive operations\ndeal with bio-chem,\n\nthe battle management\ntogether\n\nto\n\nnuclear, and then have\nsystem tie all that\n\nin a synergistic\n\neffect.\n\nBig one there is broadcast intelligence.\nWhat we\nneed to do with broadcast intelligence\nis have it in\nsuch a manner where it is winnowed right down to the\nuser. You don\'t overpower the guy with too much, but\nwhat he needs to know is winnowed right down to the\nguy that needs it. Put the next one on, please.\nSo to control the force the way we do it today, of\ncourse, our backbone is DSCS. In the future we need\nto be able to do DSCS smaller and do it on the move.\nWe need to get into the man portable SatCom business, and we need to get into Tri-band and Star-T.\nAnd then you look over on the right here, again it\'s\nSatCom paging, SatCom on the move, global broadcast systems, and we really need to start getting into\nlaser comms. Put the next one on, please.\nNow, what\'s it do for maneuver?\nWhat we want to\ndo is really shrink down the decision cycle on the\nother guy. Operate at such a high operational\ntempo\nthat he can\'t respond to what we\'re doing. He can\'t\nreact to what we\'re doing. In order to do that, you\nabsolutely have to know the environment--everything\nabout your environment,\nthe Blue environment,\nand\neverything that we know from all means about the Red\nenvironment.\nTo do that, we\'re big on breakdown\nlink, continuous comms (especially comms on the\nmove), real-time weather, absolute terrain analysis,\nreal-time targeting and a deep-strike\ncapability where\nwe can shape the battlefield that we\'re going to maneuver on in just a matter of minutes or hours. Next\nslide, please.\nSo how do we get there from here? We\'re doing\nfair right now, but what we\'re really going to do is\ndigitize the battlefield, but we can\'t digitize the battle103\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nfield without big pipes and a lot of poles from space.\nSatCom on the move, multiple sensor platforms (put a\nlot of stuff on one platform) and automatic target\nrecognition,\nwhere you see it you know exactly what it\nis and you can target it and hit it. Put the next slide\non, please.\nSo here\'s what we need from the Army standpoint.\nWe need to improve our sensors, processors,\ncommunications capabilities and have space control; and we\ndo it with those things on the right. Multi-functional\nrays, a lot of stuff on one platform, on-board processing (get a lot of data to the right guys at Wright\nPatterson AFB), assured access, whereas when the war\nstarts you\'re not used to getting it at 6.5 like\nSchwartzkopf\nwas used to getting it. It all of a sudden\nwent to 1.5 because there are too many users. And in\nspace control, all I\'ll tell you there is I believe what\nGeneral Rosenberg says, "The other guy\'s going to\nuse space too." If we\'re not going to have the capability to take down the satellite, we sure as hell better\nhave the capability to take away what the satellite is\ngiving him. Put the next one on, please.\n\nIn a doctrinal\n\nsense, space is recognized\n\nfourth medium,\n\nas a\n\nthe other media being air,\n\nland and sea.\n\nSo that\'s our vision for space in the Army. It just\nsays in the future, the Army warfighter has got to be\nable to use space as a sanctuary from which he observes the enemy, he directs his own operations,\nand\nhe denies that same capability to the enemy. Thank\nyou.\nGENERAL ASHY: Thanks,\n\nJay. Roger\n\nDeKok\n\nnow.\n\nGENERAL DEKOK: Thank you, Sir. Speaking of\nprinciples of war, I think we just witnessed another\ndemonstration\nof a principle of war: how effective\nmaneuver is in preventing\nenemy targeting as I witnessed the photographer\ntry to get General Garner\'s\npicture. That was quite impressive.\nI\'m going to talk for the next 10 minutes or so\nabout a topic that has nothing to do with space systems\nthemselves.\nI\'d like to talk about a topic though that\nhas been the subject of some controversy\nover the past\nsix to 12 months and that\'s the topic of organization.\nBut I\'d like to draw a clear distinction\nat this point.\nI\'m here to talk today about the proper organization\nfor operations.\nThere\'s been a lot of talk, there\'s been\na lot of action, and indeed there\'s going to be more\naction inside the beltway on the organization\nof Space\nfor Acquisition\nand I suspect there will be questions,\nas Mr. Klinger suggested, on that. But I\'d like to\nfocus now for a few minutes on the proper organiza-\n\n104\n\ntion for operations.\nNext chart, please.\nI\'d like to offer some considerations\nfor you.\nAlthough our doctrine is relatively mature, history\nsuggests to us that the high ground has always been\nimportant in warfare and, as I believe all of you recognize, space is the ultimate high ground. The vantage\npoint from which military operations can be observed,\ncontrolled,\nand ultimately conducted. In a doctrinal\nsense, space is recognized as a fourth medium, the\nother media being air, land and sea. Interestingly\nthough, Space Command, Unified Space Command, is\nthe only military organization\nthat is actually assigned\nmissions in space. As General Ashy has indicated,\nwe\'ve done a lot of thought about what that means in a\ndoctrine and organizational\nsense.\nIf I can have the next chart please, you\'ll see\ndepicted the current organization\nof United States\nSpace Command. It has the three service components\nthat are attached to it--Army\nSpace Command, Naval\nSpace Command and Air Force Space Command--and\nthe Air Force Space Command that supports U.S.\nSpace Command is 14th Air Force which is commanded by Major General Bill Jones at Vandenberg\nAir Force Base. Just as General Homer was the Air\nForce component commander\nto General Schwartzkopf\nin the Desert war, General Jones is the Air Force\ncomponent commander to U.S. Space Command. The\nreal question that arises in looking at this chart is, is\nthis organization\nthe correct one for space operations?\nIf I could have the next chart, please. This is\nperhaps the key chart in my entire presentation.\nIt\ndepicts areas of responsibility,\nand that, of course, is\nhow the commander-in-chiefs\nof theater commands are\nassigned geographic areas of responsibility\naround the\nglobe. Now notionally depicted on this chart are the\nland, sea, and air boundaries that are uniquely assigned to an individual commander-in-chief\nof the\ntheater. The boundaries between land and sea and\nbetween land and air obviously are well established.\nNot so well established,\nhowever, is the boundary\nbetween air and space. Exactly where do air operations end and where do space operations\ncontinue?\nOf\ncourse, we can talk about astrodynamics\nas opposed to\naerodynamics\nas being one of the dividing lines, but\nthat boundary itself in a doctrinal sense and, indeed, in\na policy sense is somewhat indistinct today. However,\nwe do have what we call supported CINCs. In the\nGulf War that was General Schwartzkopf\nas CINC\nCentral Command. He was supported, however, by\nother CINCs in this process. In the Gulf War, the best\nexample was European Command which provided a\ngreat deal of support to CENTCOM,\nand they were\nthe supporting CINC in that process.\nOverarching\nall of those areas is this medium of\nspace. This is an important doctrinal distinction that\nI\'d like to make. Only U.S. Space Command is assigned operational\nresponsibilities\nin that medium of\nspace, and that\'s an important consideration,\nI think,\n\nNATIONAL\n\nas the doctrine for Armed Forces evolves and as it\naffects space. Next chart please.\nAnd, of course, as an overarching\nmedium, space\nsupports all of our Service components.\nI think my\ncolleagues have very adequately described the importance of space in supporting land and naval operations.\nThis doctrinal chart raises some interesting questions.\nIs our current organization\nfor space correct? As you\nall know, there are commissions\nlike the Commissions\non Roles and Missions that are looking at these kinds\nof issues under a charter from the United States Senate. People have suggested that there may be alternatives to the current way we organize. Some people\nhave suggested that it may require ultimately a fifth\nmilitary service and some others have suggested that\nthe United States Air Force should be a specified\ncommand in charge of space responsibilities.\nI\'d like to talk about those here for the next minute or so. I think the notion of a fifth military service\nis quite bankrupt from the start, particularly\ngiven the\nresource implications\nand the overhead associated with\na fifth military service. Clearly, I believe, out of the\nquestion today. The other alternative,\na specified command, is often prompted by the considerations\non the\nnext chart. I think it\'s undeniable that the Air Force\nhas a preponderance\nof the resource allocation devoted\nto space, both whether you measure it in dollars or\nwhether you measure it in people. I would like to\nsuggest to you that that resource allocation that results\nin the preponderance\nof the Air Force contribution\nis\nin many cases a representation\nof the fact that the\nacquisition of space systems, multi-service\nspace systems (I might add) has historically been an Air Force\nresponsibility\nand it accounts for the majority of the\nAir Force dollars and people who are currently allocated to space. So if I could have the next chart\nplease, which is my concluding chart.\nAs we look through this process, we recognize that\nGoldwater-Nichols\nassigns to unified commanders\nthe\nability to organize their components\nby either service\nor functional components,\nand clearly it\'s a service\norganization\ntoday in U.S. Space Command. It also\nassigns to U.S. Space Command the missions of space\ncontrol, force enhancement,\nspace support and ballistic\nmissile defense, and space operations.\nAnd U.S. Space\nCommand,\nas I\'ve already stated, operates uniquely in\nthe medium of space.\nFrom all of the above, we conclude that the current organization\nof service component responsibilities\nis clearly the proper one for space operations,\nand I\'!1\nbe glad to take questions on organization\nduring the\nQ&A. Thank you very much.\n\nQ&A\nASHY: This question\'s for both Mr. Harris\nand Mr. Klinger. What\'s your level of confidence that\nwe\'ll field SBIR in a quality, timely manner?\nGENERAL\n\nSECURITY\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nMR. KLINGER: You know, this is one of those glass is\nhalf empty/glass\nis half full approaches,\nand I tend to\ntake the glass is half full approach. Fifteen months ago\nnobody would have bet a dime that we would be\nwhere we are, either from an organizational\nstandpoint\nor with regard to the SBIR program. Quite frankly, it\nhasn\'t been a picnic by any stretch of the imagination\nbecause of points we were making earlier. It\'s a cultural change and that\'s a hard thing to do. And it\'s\nhabit and it\'s mode of operation and all of the things\nthat grew up over 35-some odd years of doing business a particular\nway. But having said that, we\'re\nhere.\nWe have validated requirements\nthat everyone has\nsigned up to. There is consensus above the level of the\nlowest common denominator.\nAnd it\'s not just consensus that matters, because we frequently get consensus\nin the Department\nof Defense; we just get it at the\nminimum everyone can agree upon.\nThat is not the case with this early warning program. We have an unprecedented\nsituation in which\nfolks in Jeff\'s organization--and\nall of the other stake\nholders in space--all\nthe way from the combatant\ncommand user level all the way back to Los Angeles\nwhere Space & Missile Command is, out here in Colorado Springs, and inside the beltway all got together\nand said we need to do business differently.\nIs this as\nfar as we need to go? No. Is it the best of all possible\nworlds? I\'m not sure I know what the definition of the\n"best of all possible worlds" is. I do know that what\nwe have are fairly rigorously defined requirements\nthat\nhave been scrubbed and continue to be scrubbed.\nWe have a high level of cooperation\nbetween the\nworking level people up and down Jeff\'s organization\nand the Air Force. We have the active participation\nand cooperation\nof all the other uniformed\nmilitary\nservices, their civilian secretariats\nand the office of the\nsecretary of defense. And quite frankly, we have the\nfirm commitment\nof the secretary, the deputy secretary\nand my boss, Paul Kaminski. If for no other reason\nthat nothing focuses the mind like the prospect of a\ngood hanging, we have a full-up commitment to make\nthis work. We are in uncharted territory, both organizationally and in terms of how we do business, which\nis to say there are going to be some turns down the\nroad that we decide after some number of weeks or\nmonths, "Nah, we\'ve got to do something differently." But we have no choice but to execute this\nprogram. We have no choice but to change the way\nwe do business in space because there is no question\nthat if we are perceived as having failed to do so, the\nCongress is going to move in on us and change it for\nus. And by their own admission, they bring a meat ax\nand not a scalpel to the job which really requires a\nscalpel. So I guess I don\'t view this as a bad news\nstory. This is a resounding good news story to me. I\nthink it\'s sort of unreasonable\nto expect us to be able\nto go from where we were to where we want to get to\nall in one step, in part because we\'re not sure of\n105\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nwhere we do want to get to, as I said earlier.\nthink this is, in fact, a good news story.\nGENERAL ASHY:\namplify?\n\nBut I\n\nMr. Harris, would you care to\n\nMR. HARRIS: To make it easy--Jay\nGarner said that\ntheater missiles are a threat. We all understand that.\nWe\'ve stopped building DSP which doesn\'t address\nthat threat. We have the time, we have the money, we\nhave the technology.\nGENERAL ASHY: From my perspective, I agree. We\nhave no choice. We have consensus.\nI think we have\nthe technology and to bring an added perspective or\numbrella to this process that Gil and Jeff both spoke\nof, I think through the JROC process. Having taken\nthe requirements\nthat everyone agreed to last summer\nto that process, I think we have unanimous agreement\nand commitment.\nSo, I think the future is bright when\nyou put all those together.\nBefore Gil leaves, let me fire-hose him a little bit.\nWe\'re getting a lot of questions here on perspectives\non space control. I think Jay covered it very well.\nPerhaps Gil, you could give us your perspective\non\nspace control and protection of our side, and denial of\nthe other side.\nMR. HARRIS: I think that as my presentation\nand the\nother presentations\nalluded to, we have always placed\na heavy emphasis on knowing what\'s going on in\nspace. A lot of that emphasis came from our civilian\nspace operations where we had safety of flight considerations and continue to have safety of flight considerations, first for Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and now for\nshuttle operations and in the future for the space station. None of this is in fact news, that\'s the first thing\nI\'d say. We have had an emphasis on being situationally aware with regard to space since 1957.\nWhat\'s changed is our ability to fulfill that set of requirements,\nso that is not new. I think it was Jay who\nmade the point that everyone focuses with regard to\nspace control on what\'s up there. What\'s up there is\nreally a delivery truck. It\'s a collector in some cases\nand a delivery truck in other cases.\nWhat the Department\nof Defense needs to do is\nkeep the bad guys from getting the information\nthat\nthey need, wherever it came from and wherever it\'s\nbeing passed. Therefore,\nif I put a 500-pound bomb\nthrough somebody\'s\nSPOT down-link in Baghdad,\nthat\'s space control. There are lots of ways to do this\njob. They are inextricably woven up with the bigger\npicture of information\ncontrol, and in that sense I\nguess I focus less on space control per se as the relationship between space control and information\nwarfare, if you will, or information\ncontrol. Making sure\nwe have enough protection\nfor our on orbit communications links and terrestrial\ninfrastructures,\na piece of\nthat equation. Obviously it\'s an area we are focusing\n106\n\non now and will continue to focus on. But I don\'t\nwant anyone to have the impression that this is a new\nproblem or a new set of issues. What\'s changed is the\nemphasis.\nGENERAL ASHY: Thank you. Question for Mr. Harris. When will the NRO declassify its organizational\nchart and release documents?\nMR. HARRIS: In the Fall of 1992 Secretary Cheney\ndeclassified the NRO and our seven employees. We\nare quite proud of what we do with those seven employees. This year we will complete the declassification of the overall organization\nand the folks who have\nled to our successes over the years in the acquisition\nof space systems. I suspect we\'ll have that all done in\nthe next month or so.\nGENERAL ASHY: From my perspective, the NRO and\nMr. Harris are trying very hard to work with us because I think it\'s key to supporting the warfighter,\nalthough most areas will not become unclassified.\nWe\nappreciate his efforts.\nBefore Mr. Klinger leaves, we have a couple\nquestions here on the organizational\nbusiness as you\nreferred to it. Could you expand on that please?\nMR. KLINGER: I just want tO go back to a point\nabout JeWs organization. Given its mission, the NRO\nis the most agile, the most innovative organization\nwe\nhave in the acquisition phases and operations\nin the\nDepartment of Defense. Its accomplishments\nare nothing short of awesome. It is a convenient stalking horse\nfor the people who point to the problems that we have\nin space, just as the United States Air Force is a convenient stalking horse. That\'s just an unfair characterization.\nThe Department\nof Defense corporately has challenges and problems it needs to address with regard to\nspace. Those are not confined to any single organization, party, individual, office, whatever. But I will tell\nyou that the flower of what we do as a country technologically, much of that resides within Jeff\'s organization. One of the things I often sort of lament is that for\nnational security reasons we were unable to demonstrate that more openly. It would be a source of pride\nfor everyone who is a taxpayer. But this debate gets\nmisplaced and polarized, and it has been and is a\nsource of great frustration\nto everyone in the office of\nthe Secretary of Defense and, I think, most people in\nthe Department.\nWe need to do space more like Jeff\'s operation\nand not less. And when we do that, we will be a good\nway down the road toward addressing\na lot of the\nproblems you\'ve heard described earlier.\nNow, what was the question? I\'ll expect payment\nfor this later on.\n\nNATIONAL\n\nGENERAL ASHY: Space policy\nupdate.\n\nand organization--an\n\nMR. KLINGER: The Office of the Deputy Undersecretary of Space has been established.\nWe are in the\nmidst of identifying floor space, computers,\nand all of\nthat good stuff while still attempting to execute the\nmission of the organization.\nThe mission of the organization\nis to provide an\nOSD focal point for the universe of space-related\nactivities, no pun intended. Previously,\nthose functions\nare split over the Policy organization\nwhere I was, the\nAcquisition and Technology\norganization,\nand within\nEmmit Page\'s Command, Control and Communications and Communications\norganization.\nWhat we are trying to provide, amongst other\nthings, is a one-stop shopping location for space issues\nwhich would relieve the burden that all of the services\nand defense agencies now face of having to run all\nover the place inside OSD. When they ran all over the\nplace they really didn\'t get good answers to a lot of\ntheir questions. We had a fragmented approach to\ndealing with space, so that\'s one piece of the mission\nand we\'re on our way to doing that.\nThe organization\nwill be populated heavily by\nfolks from all of the services as well as the NRO and\nthe other defense agencies. It is not the mission of the\nOffice of the Secretary of Defense to replicate the\nexisting capabilities resident in Jeff\'s organization,\nin\nthe Air Force, in the Army, in the Navy, and at\nDISA. Rather it is the mission of the organization\nto\nprovide a nucleus of people who do have a capability\nto survey what is going on in all those organizations\nand, more to the point, tap into those resources and\nwork with them.\nPaul Kaminski differentiates\nbetween what he calls\n"doing it" functions or execution and "see to it" functions which, for lack of a better term, are oversight\nfunctions. There are three basic areas for the OSD\norganization:\none is policy, the second is architectures,\nthe third is programmatic.\nIt is in the policy organization that you will find the lion\'s share of the execution\nfunctions within the new OSD space organization.\nThat organization\nis responsible\nin working with the\nJoint Staff, the Unified Command, the NRO and the\nservices for formulating\nDoD space policy and seeing\nto its execution and implementation\nin whatever form\nthat occurs.\nWith regard to the architectural\noffice, the principal responsibility\nfor that office will be to work with\nthe as-yet to be developed or under-development\nDoD\nspace architect to break down some of the barriers you\nheard Jeff and others describe this morning.\nBust\ndown the vertical stovepipes and create a much more\nhorizontally\nintegrated approach to doing things. I\'ll\ngive you an example. If we\'d had that organization\nset\nup 15 months ago, the DoD Space Architect would\nhave run the SBIR summer study. If it was set up\nnow, it would be running the MilSatCom\narchitecture\n\nSECURITY\n\nREQUIREMP2qTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nstudy. All of those cross-cutting\nissues and looking\nboth within missions, whether it\'s MilSatCom or\nlaunch, the execution for that will be in the DoD\nSpace Architect; the OSD component mainly charged\nwith working with the DoD Space Architect. The\nPrograms Office within OSD, as the name indicates, to\nmake sure we\'ve got the funding streams right and we\nhave technical issues to work out supporting the acquisition process, but doing so in a much more streamlined manner.\nOne of the things that Paul Kaminski,\nJohn Deutch\nand Bill Perry are committed to is shrinking the time\nscale by which we do acquisition-related\nprocess with\nregard to everything in the Pentagon, but particularly\nwith regard to space. Those of you involved in the\nSBIR activity hopefully have seen that manifest already. You\'ll see more of it in the future. Heavy emphasis also is placed on involving the operators-General\nAshy\'s organization\nand the other\nCINCs--very\nearly in the process.\n(I think Jay alluded to the fact that you have to get the other CINCs\ninvolved, the warfighters\ninvolved, early on to identify\nthe requirements\nand articulate whether those are real.)\nThose are some of the things that we will be doing.\nThe process is occurring today back in Washington.\nWe are working with the Air Force, which asked to\ncome back to the Secretary of Defense with recommendations\nabout the DoD Space Architect and that is\noccurring in real time.\nGENERAL ASHY: Any other additions to that from the\npanel members? General Garner mentioned integration\nand the challenge of that. I\'d like to ask the service\nmembers on the panel to comment on how you see the\nfuture. I think Jay mentioned it and its importance.\nLet\nme start off with Walt. I think you mentioned it in\nyour remarks. I think it\'s important,\nso could you give\nus a little bit more detail on your perspectives?\nADMIRAL DAVIS: It\'s essential to us. I think I did\nmention it in ours. The focus is to win. We said at the\nbeginning of this that we\'re going to win jointly, and\nif we\'re going to win jointly, then we must be in\nagreement. I don\'t think that that has been a challenge,\nit\'s not been an obstacle at all. The cooperation\namong\nthe services today to do that, in my opinion, is great.\nWe realize that.\nGENERAL ASHY: Jay, you said something about that\nalready. I think certainly I received your point on its\nimportance.\nGENERAL GARNER: I think we\'re on the road to common integration among the services. Right now, from\nmy experience,\nwe make it work, but it\'s awful hard\nto make it work. As we go down this road, I think\nwe\'re getting closer and closer together. Where we\'re\ngoing to have a problem in the future is with coalitions, and I think I said that a couple times. And I\n107\n\n1 1 TH NATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\ndon\'t know how you solve that problem. Eventually I\nthink you\'ll see all the services coalesce and we\'ll\nprobably be pretty well integrated,\nbut I don\'t know\nhow we solve the coalition problem.\nGENERAL ASHY: Roger?\n\nAnything\n\nto add?\n\nGENERAL DEKOK: Sir, I\'d just like to add one additional perspective.\nI think the highest leverage opportunity is to get the services together early on in the\nrequirements\nprocess and to have them participate in\nthe trade that Mr. Klinger talked about in terms of\naffordability vs. capability. And I think if we could do\nthat early in the process and get the requirements\nestablished and understand\nhow far down we are in the\nrequirements\ncost capability trade space. That would\nbe the best thing that we could do.\nGENERAL ASHY" O.K., thank you. We\'ve just received several questions which I think were prompted\nby Gil\'s remarks on the organization\nand the architect\nand so forth, and it has to do with the perception of\nAir Force control. I hope Roger dispelled that; from\nmy perspective\nit has been dispelled. Let me just ask\nWalt and Jay to comment. I think we\'ve got that sorted out, but let\'s ask representatives\nof the other two\nservices. I\'m purple-suited,\nso I\'m not in this argument. Jay, let me start with you. I know that as a\ncomponent commander\nwe\'ve addressed that in the\njoint way, I think we\'ve got it sorted out. I\'m not so\nsure that there\'s an issue with it, but maybe there\'s a\nremaining perception.\nYour thoughts, please.\nGENERAL GARNER: About two months ago I guess,\nthe vices all met with Paul Kaminski, Gil, Jeff, and a\nfew of the rest of us. We all agreed to what\'s happening right now. I don\'t remember there being an awful\nlot of arguments with that. We all agreed to the way\nthings are being laid out now. From the Army perspective, what we\'ve asked for and have received is\nwe said we want a place at the table to delineate our\nrequirements\nfor space. And we\'re receiving that. We\nwant to maintain control of the ground terminals,\nwe\'re doing that. And we want to keep our own unique TENCAP business but certainly there can be\nsome oversight there to make sure all the TENCAPs\naren\'t doing the same thing. And that\'s happening. So\nas I see it, things are progressing\npretty good. I\'m\nreally not upset with the way things work.\nADMIRAL DAVlS: Gil hit it on the head when he was\ntalking about the architect. That\'s certainly recognized\nby the leadership that that architect\'s\noffice must be\nmade up of everyone. That\'s the only way we\'ll be\nable to do this. So as long as we keep that perspective\nthere\'ll be, I\'m sure like all organizations\ndown in the\nbowels there, folks that feel differently about this and\nwill be fighting for what they think is control. But I\n\n108\n\nthink that since we have leadership that understands\nthis, this will be resolved in the right way.\nJay hit it on the head. If we go back and focus on\nthe right thing, most of those things will settle out. So\nif we focus on what we\'re trying to do, that\'ll settle\nout. We\'ve got a good example of that, by the way,\nwhere there\'s not controversy.\nThat\'s in the development of the Global Command and Control System.\nThere we\'re all on focus, there\'s no argument, everybody is focused in there and that\'s evolving in the best\nway. Perhaps we can follow that example.\nGENERAL GARNER: I think we\'re all kind of in\nagreement.\nAll I\'m waiting on is to find out how many\nArmy guys I can stick into this organization\nso I know\nwhat they\'re doing.\nGENERAL ASHY: From my perspective,\nthis is a very\nimportant issue that is certainly lesser of an issue.\nWe\'re all in agreement, we\'re on record in that regard, we\'ve answered questions and made recommendations to the Roles and Missions Commission\nfrom\nthe Unified Headquarters.\nAs all of the panel members\nhave pointed out, we\'re not going to improve and\nfulfill our visions unless we cooperate. From the Unified perspective,\nwe are organized properly with service components.\nEvery service contributes to the\nfight; therefore, they must have the right and have the\nobligation to participate in the process that leads to\nsome of these capabilities that all of the panel members have talked about.\nWhat Mr. Klinger talked about is primarily how\nwe\'re going to fuse that at the top in terms of policy\nand acquire the systems once we decide on what we\nneed. I think that\'s fair to say; is it not true, Gil?\nMR. KLINGER: The only thing I\'d add from an OSD\nperspective as a civilian--with\n30,000 people in the\nPentagon--especially\nas a civilian, it is very difficult\nto stay in touch with what the mission is. I\'ve been\nfortunate because I work with people and work with\ncivilians who are aware of this. My mission is to\nsupport the warfighter;\nnot much else makes any difference. Change in our business frequently starts at the\ntop and what you\'re hearing is a good news story in\nthat that change is occurring from the top down. All of\nyou know that lower down in individual program\noffices where, at any given moment, people are fighting or haggling over this/that/the\nother thing, that\ncultural change hasn\'t pervaded as far as we\'d want it\nto. That\'s going to take time. That\'s the nature of the\nbusiness. But the message that we are sending, I personally believe, is that if we do not have an operational focus that\'s principally geared toward supporting\nthe warfighter,\nthe only good news is--and it\'s because it\'s the lesser of two evils--is that we\'re going\nto fail organizationally\nand the next time you have one\nof these conferences,\nthere\'ll be somebody else sitting\nhere.\n\nNATIONAL\n\nThe down side is that people are going to die. If\nwe don\'t fix what we have to in space, the next time\nwe have to send men and women into combat, some of\nthem will die who will not have had to. If that is not a\nreason to get our act together, I don\'t know what is.\nThat imperative drives me every day, drives the people at this table every day because they are obviously\nmuch closer to it than I, and certainly drives my management. There is a sense of urgency about what we\nare doing in space for a whole variety of reasons, but\nat the bottom line, that is the greatest urgency.\nGENERAL ASHY: Thank you gentlemen.\nMr. Klinger,\ncould you give us your perspectives\non the relationship\nbetween the ABM Treaty and the need for National\nMissile Defense and Theater Missile Defense and\nwhere all that issue is. A very easy question.\nMR. KLINGER: Sure, sure. To my infinitely great\ngood fortune, I have nothing to do with the arms control business and I never have. I was in the targeting\nbusiness, which was the other end of this when I was\nin the strategic business. I would ask all the arms\ncontrol people to leave the room so I could get done\nwhat I needed to at that point. So I\'m no expert on\nthis issue.\n\nSECURITY\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nand in a certain time period where the world looked to\nbe a certain way. I don\'t think it makes much sense to\nsimply continue.\nIf, in fact, we decide that many of\nthose conditions have changed, it sort of fails my\ncommon sense test to continue to adhere to that document for it\'s own sake. I also don\'t subscribe to the\nnotion that the whole house (all the other arms control\ntreaties that we think still make sense, and the remainder of the ABM Treaty), I don\'t buy the notion that\nthe whole house of cards comes crashing down if, in\nfact, you begin to make modifications\nthat we and our\nnegotiating partner believe are in our mutual national\nsecurity interests. I just don\'t buy that argument.\nGENERAL ASHY: As a follow-up to Mr. Klinger\'s\nremarks, let me ask Jay and perhaps Walt to give us\nan update on where you are with testing of core systems, AEGIS and THAAD perhaps. Jay, let me start\nwith you.\n\nI think obviously if you read the papers and you\nhear, those of you who are inside the beltway hear the\nvarious and sundry stories of what\'s going on. This\nissue is in play. All I can give you is the following,\nvery personal perspective--and\nthat\'s exactly what it\nis.\n\nGENERAL GARNER: We are just beginning to do\nTHAAD flights. THAAD seems to be going pretty\nwell. It\'s been pushed to the right a little bit, but most\nof that was due to a $65 million Congressional\ncut that\nwe got in \'95. It seems to be going pretty good.\nWe\'re in dialogue with the Navy on Upper Tier,\nnot necessarily Marinize and THAAD, but on working\nthe leak kill vehicle for the Navy and doing some\nother work there. We are beginning to increase our\ncapability at Kwajalein to test at multiple ranges for\nthe theater missile defense threat. We\'re trying to\nobtain another island to launch from so that we can do\n\nTo the extent that we have a requirement\nbeginning to border on urgent to provide a theater missile\ndefense capability, to the extent that in the future we\nmay decide that that requirement\nextends over to national missile defense, my personal opinion is that we\nwould have to take a hard look at the existing treaties\nin place that made an infinite amount of good sense\nwhen they were signed and to a large measure make\nsense now.\nIf we believe that the threat is of a character that\nour men and women in uniform and those of our allies\nare at risk, I believe it would be foolhardy for us to\nfail to take the actions necessary to protect our capabilities and our people, our most valuable resources,\nmerely on the basis of what I would believe at that\npoint and in those circumstances\nis adherence to an\nobsolete piece of paper. The treaty is obviously much\nmore than that. It is valuable, it is in our national\nsecurity interests, it is in our foreign policy interest.\nBut it is not immutable. Times have changed, and to\nthe extent that those times and the threats and challenges we face, the ones Jeff alluded to, I and my\ncolleagues need to take a very hard to look at what\nkinds of modifications\nor changes--and\nI don\'t know\nthat there necessarily\nare any. That\'s for the lawyers\nand other people to decide. But the ABM Treaty was a\ntreaty negotiated under a certain set of presumptions\n\nsome testing between the 400-500 kilometer range. So\nI think all that\'s coming along pretty good from an\nArmy perspective.\nBut I put on sort of my military hat and take off\nmy Army hat. The problem, I think, in theater missile\ndefense is because of the lack of resources. We\'re\nplaying system vs. system, and that\'s the wrong way\nto do it because the theater missile threat is here now.\nAnd everybody\'s\nproposed a system that brings a lot\nto the table. And I\'m going to tell you, that\'s the show\nstopper of the next war. So I think it\'s wrong, say, to\nplay off Army Upper Tier versus Navy Upper Tier. I\nthink the Navy has to have an Upper Tier because\nthat\'s the only way your going to get, in certain scenarios, some ascent phase shots, which are really\ncritical. Look at the longer-range\nmissiles being fired\nout of, say, Libya into Europe to perhaps threaten us\nwith our force projection. We can take our Army\nLower Tier and Army Upper Tier and we can protect\nsome places in Europe, but we can\'t protect everywhere. So we only have a finite number of assets we\ncan protect. But if you had an Upper Tier capability,\nsay a Naval Upper Tier capability, you could come\nright off shore and get many of those missiles when\nthey\'re fired in the ascent phase.\nSo you say, well, maybe you ought to have a\nNavy Upper Tier and an Army Upper Tier. Well,\n109\n\n| 1TH NATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nthere\'s too many places where the Army operates\nthat\'s so far inland that the tether is no longer long\nenough to protect us. You can\'t trade those two systems off--you\'ve\ngot to have both of them. I just don\'t\nthink you can get enough people, or enough of the\nservices, in the missile defense business right now\nbecause, if I was on the Red team, the first thing I\'d\ntry to do is prevent our force projection\nand the way\nI\'d try to prevent our force projections\nis with weapons of mass destruction.\nAnd the way I\'d deliver\nweapons of mass destruction\non you is with theater\nballistic missiles and cruise missiles. So I don\'t think\nyou can have enough people in the business.\nADMIRAL DAVIS: I concur fully with Jay on that one.\nAs he mentioned, that threat is here today. We\'re\nhaving some great success, I believe, with cooperation\nto try to get some of the things we have to work,\ncorporate engagement\ncapability is one of those. Tests\non that are showing great results and that\'s something\nwe can do with our existing capability and integrating\nthem. There we are back to that integration word\nagain. It\'s all we\'re really doing with that and trying\nto use it in the best way. So I think that\'s surviving\nwell.\nI think this tremendous\nvision of all the leaders is\nthere for that kind of thing and I think the cooperation\namong the services is there to make it happen.\nGENERAL ASHY: From my perspective,\nI couldn\'t\nagree more; and I think what the two gentlemen said is\nwe need defense in-depth, and a term I\'ve learned\nfrom my Army colleagues on the Unified staff: We\nneed to buy battle space. You need to be able to detect\nbefore they take off, as Jay said in his talk, but if they\ndo get airborne, you need to shoot them early. And it\nneeds to be a big umbrella and you need to have more\nthan one chance. And I think that\'s what Jay\'s saying.\nIs that basically true?\nGENERAL GARNER: I think you need to be able to kill\nthem in every phase of their flight.\nGENERAL ASHY: Absolutely.\nGENERAL GARNER" I mean, you can\'t kill them all in\nthe boost phase, you\'re not going to kill them all in\nthe ascent phase. Some of them are going to get\nthrough so you have to have some terminal phase\nstuff.\nGENERAL ASHY: And everyone contributes.\nI think\nthat\'s what both gentlemen are saying. So, in that\nregard, we\'ve got a panel on laser technology development. Could one of you kind of give a short overview\nof where we are in that program?\nJay, maybe you could, or Roger?\n\nGENERAL GARNER: We\'re doing two things in lasers.\nFirst of all, we\'re doing a very low level of funding in\nlaser comms, and I think there\'s a big payoff in laser\ncomms because if you can do that, you get the kind of\npipes you need to do a lot of things. The other we\'re\ndoing is we have a fairly large laser facility at White\nSands we call HELSTAF that the Army unfunded\nbecause of resource implications,\nnot because we\ndidn\'t want to do it. We unfunded it two years ago\nand that money has been put into it at about $25-26\nmillion a year by the Congress ever since \'93 and\nCongress continues to fund that.\nWe\'re right now working at White Sands with the\nIsraelis on a small project called Nautilus to see what\nis the ability to weaponize lasers to do some missile\ndefense work. We\'ll finish that in \'96. The degree to\nwhich we answer that problem will determine how\nmuch further we go in that. The Israelis are very\ninterested to attack the 122 problems they have right\nnow, the Frog problem, and other problems.\nWe\'re kind of interested in it because if it works,\nit\'s a cheap kill against cheap rockets. Right now as\nwe try to kill rockets in flight, we use an awfully\nexpensive system to do that. It\'s not a cost-effective\ntrade-off.\nSo if Congress lets us, we\'ll probably close our\nMIRACL laser in \'96. Then if there\'s any weaponization that comes out of the work we\'re doing with\nthe Israelis, and I kind of think there may be, we\'ll\ncontinue on a smaller level on the weaponization\nof\nhigh-energy\nlasers. But that\'s the tactical stuff, not\nreally the strategic stuff.\nGENERAL ASHY: Thank you, Jay. For Mr. Harris, a\nquestion about what ARPA is doing with reconnaissance. Will it dilute or take away or add to or how\nwill it interface with space-borne collection?\nHow are\nwe integrating those two efforts?\nMR. HARRIS: In my previous job, I was instrumental\nin the establishment\nof the DARO because it\'s an\nimportant capability to be able to integrate the strength\nof airborne reconnaissance\nwith the strengths of spacebased reconnaissance,\nand they are without question\ncomplementary.\nIn the stand-up of the DARO organization, we have worked very closely with General\nIsrael to make sure that the two pieces fit together and\nwe have co-located both offices together, the National\nReconnaissance\nOffice and the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance\nOffice into the same physical office\nspaces at the Pentagon to try and ensure that communications are taking place and we can leverage each of\nour architectures.\nWe have published an Integrated\nProgram and Technology\nPlan that General Israel and\nI have both signed up for. So I think we\'re off to a\npretty good start there.\nGENERAL ASHY: Thank you. Gil\'s got to leave here\nin three minutes. Before he does, one last question,\n\n110\n\nNATIONAL\n\njust sorting through all of these. And I think we can\nall address it. Can you give us the big picture perspective on shared warning and it\'s importance to stability\nin working with our allies?\nMR. KLINGER: I think shared warning is an example\nof one of the places that we were talking about earlier\nthat we have capabilities already in existence and we\'ll\nhave more in the future. Capabilities that are fairly\nunique, quite apart from the systems that Russia has\nwhere we can offer a service to our allies, a service\nthat is critical to them. More critical at any given\nmoment than they are to us with the end of the Cold\nWar. Because if you look at the map, Africa and some\nof the more unpleasant actors in Africa are a lot closer\nto Europe than they are to us. And this simple fact is\nnot lost on our French, Italian, British, and Spanish\nallies, judging from some of their comments two\nweeks ago when I attended the Western European\nUnion Meetings in Grand Canary Islands. While some\nof them were berating us about dominating the market\nin a one-way competition,\nthey also are rather interested in what we have to offer in terms of early warning and what do you get out of this.\nWell, a number of things. First of all, to the extent\nwe increase our cooperation\non early warning both\nwithin NATO and on a bilateral basis with some of\nour other allies, you are guaranteed to increase interoperability.\nTo the extent that those services are provided in return for arrangements\nthat are either financial in nature or of some other type, we get benefits\nand leverage at a time where are own resources are\ndiminishing.\nWe further have the capability to make\nthe path for cooperation\nin other areas. In other\nwords, to the extent that an otherwise reluctant partner\nof the United States discovers to their pleasant surprise\nthat we are a reliable partner, capable of providing\nservices that otherwise are not available but are nonetheless crucial to that country\'s national security, it\'s\ngoing to open the door to some other cooperative\nventures in the future. So I think it is a win-win proposition all the way around and what we\'re working\nboth within NATO and on more bilateral basis is how\ndo we get from here to there. How do you go, as Jeff\nput it earlier, how do you go from the notepad to the\nactualization\nof those capabilities?\nGENERAL ASHY: Gil, you\'re going to have to leave,\nso I\'d like everyone to join in thanking you for coming and have a safe trip. Really appreciate it.\nBuilding on what Gii just talked about in terms of\nshared warning, we\'ve got several questions here and\nI\'m trying to wrap them all up. I\'d like our panel\nmembers to address some specifics about service contributions. It\'s important that we address shared warning. The notion of stability and deterrence is what\nwe\'re about here, and we, in the Unified Command,\nhave been tasked to put an operations concept together. We have the capability now. So what we tried\n\nSECUR1TY\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nto do is construct a system and propose it in our concept to General Shali and the Joint Staff and the DoD\nstaff where it\'s flexible enough so that as the political\nand policy decisions are decided upon, that you can\ntake this pipe of shared warning, (I\'m talking about\nspace-borne\nwarning), and do what you want to with it\nin continence with the policy. So that\'s basically the\nconcept we have proposed using the Tactical Events\nSystem we talked about. I\'m going to ask Jay to talk a\nlittle about JTAGS and Roger to talk about ALERT in\nthat regard. But, the point is that we have improved\nthe tactical events warning capability drastically since\nDesert Storm. I can\'t go into a lot of detail about it,\nbut we have focused quite a bit on it. We have the\nsystem in place, and from the U.S. Space Command\nand NORAD perspective,\nwe are going to follow up at\nmy level, the joint level, the U.S. Space Command\nlevel, and not encumber the flow of data to the theater\ncommander.\nBut we\'re going to back it up and make\nsure it\'s correlated and it\'s correct and fulfill our\nresponsibilities\nin reporting events around the world to\nthe proper authorities.\nSo that kind of covers the policy, the concept.\nPerhaps, Jay, you could give us a\nshort burst on JTAGS. It\'s working well, and maybe\nyou can tell the audience where it is and a few particulars about it.\nGENERAL GARNER: We\'re going to, our plan is to\nhave five JTAG systems. We currently have one in\nEurope and we just put one in Korea. The one in\nKorea is at OSAN. It\'s being tested right now and it\'s\ndoing very, very well. We direct down-link JTAGS\nright into core headquarters.\nWe also put it right directly into the theater missile defense tactical operations center that we have here in ARSPACE that deploys to whatever contingency\nwe have.\nSo JTAGS is working real well. What it does, it\ngives right now within about a 15 square kilometer\nbox--and\nmost times a little smaller than that--where\na\nlaunch came from. That allows us then to cross queue\nwhatever sensor we have, perhaps a UAV into there.\nWe\'ve already gone through a little bit of IPB and\ncanceled out to the terrain in which the class of missiles we\'re fighting can\'t deploy in. So that makes that\nbox a little smaller and narrows the search.\nSo what\nwe try to do is get a sensor in there as fast as we can;\nfind the guy; track him back to his lair if he moves; or\nif he stays right there, kill him. If he moves, track him\nuntil he gets back to the lair and kill him in his lair.\nAnd then it gives us a box in which impact is\ngoing to occur. That varies in size but it\'s always\npretty large. What we need to do with JTAGS in the\nfuture is get the box that shows where a launch occurred from down much smaller, and get the point of\nimpact more precise. The problem we have right now\noccurs with warning. We know when launch occurs,\nwe\'ve got a general idea where the impact\'s going to\noccur, so we want to warn the affected units. The\nproblem is we have to go through so many common\n111\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nnodes that you can\'t get through in time, so you end\nup warning the whole theater. What we have to really\ndo is work on the warning problem so we can do\ndiscrete warning and get it right down to Charlie Company of the 52nd Infantry and tell them you\'d better\nmop up because one\'s coming in.\nFrom where we are right now in the state of the\nart of JTAGS, we\'re doing real well. We will have\ntwo JTAG systems here in Colorado Springs; we\'ll\nprobably have a third one at Fort Bliss where we teach\nthe crews.\nGENERAL ASHY: Thanks,\nALERT.\n\nJay. Roger,\n\na little bit on\n\nGENERAL DEKOK: Yes, Sir. As I believe most in the\naudience know, we\'ve gone operational\nwith ALERT\nlocate and report to the theater. Our theater missile\nwarning system is based on DSP technology using\nvirtually the same software that was developed for JTAGS. The difference is we take all of the DSP\nsources from all of the various satellites around the\nworld and additional information,\nand fuse it centrally\nout at Falcon Air Force Base in the 1lth Space Warning Squadron. We\'ve been extremely pleased with the\ncapability that\'s been developed there. We, very similar to JTAGS, had concerns about the reliability and\ntimelil_ess of the dissemination\nmechanism in terms of\ncommunications\nthat\'s used for that, but I believe we\nhave proven to ourselves that we have just about achieved the limit of capability of milking information\nfrom the fundamental\nfocal plane of the DSP sensor.\nAnd it has been a great improvement\nin our capability\nto provide that warning to the theater.\nIt has also served as a prototype for what we believe will evolve into the ground architecture\nfor the\nspace-based infrared system in terms of ability to fuse\ninformation from multiple sources, which I believe is\nreally the promise of the future when we get to theater\nmissile warning.\nSo we\'re quite excited about the capability.\nIt\'s\nmoving in the right direction,\nand I believe we\'ve\nestablished a linkage to the future with a space-based\ninfrared system that will serve us and the nation well.\nGENERAL ASHY: A related question.\nWhat is the\npreferred system to direct down-link,\nas Jay referred\nto it, in a kind of a centralized hub? Let me try to\nrespond to that.\nIn continence with our organization,\nwith service\ncomponents,\nwe have developed systems by component and we have given the theater commanders\na\nchoice. Direct down-link or a hub. But in the overall\nperspective,\nJ-TAGS and ALERT systems are basically the same. They\'re routed a little bit differently.\nWhat we\'re trying to do, though, from my perspective, is make this a seamless system so that the commander can choose and we give them, no matter how\nit\'s routed, reliable, stereo-quality,\ntrue, quick infer112\n\nmation. And so, I think that the Navy, the Air Force,\nand the Army components\nwould all agree. I think\nwe\'ve made great strides, and Jay covered some of\nthose quantifiable improvements.\nSo the answer is we\'re not going to run this thing\nfrom Cheyenne Mountain, if that\'s the genesis of the\nquestion. We\'re going to back it up because, as the\nunified commander\nwith the components\nwho own\nthese systems, I have to make sure that when we report it, after we do it reliably and quickly and truly,\nthat it\'s correlated and that the proper authorities are\nquickly notified.\nFor Mr. Harris, could you give us an idea of how,\nin your Air Force hat, are you going to fit into this\nnew acquisition scheme as it unfolds? I know it\'s\nprobably not been determined,\nbut maybe you have\ninsight into this.\nMR. HARMS: It\'s clear, as Gil said, that the Department of Defense is struggling to make sure that we fix\nmore than we break in the realignment\nof space to\nmake sure that all of the citronequities\nare well protected. And so as the assistant secretary of the Air\nForce for Space, we\'re working hard to make sure that\nthe avenues for dialogue are open as we begin to make\nthese changes. We continue to be concerned that we\ndon\'t add additional bureaucracy\nto the process that\nwe\'ve all agreed needs to be fixed, and so I think\nwe\'re all working together to try and make sure we\ndot the i\'s and cross the t\'s properly.\nWe\'ve decided to hold, with my second hat on, the\nintegration with the National Reconnaissance\nOffice\naside for a few months here in order, as Paul\nKaminski would say, to allow the process to stabilize a\nlittle bit in some of the streamlining steps to take effect\nwithin the larger effort. So we\'re trying to be very\nhelpful in that process to create a framework that will\nallow for the appropriate\ncoordination\nto take place\nwith the National Intelligence Systems at a later date.\nGENERAL ASHY: Thank you, Jeff. For our military\npanel members, there\'s a question about how we train\nservice members on space systems. Could I get you all\nto maybe give some perspectives\non that? How about\nthe Navy? I\'m sure you do that through Naval Space\nCommand. Walt, perhaps you could start.\nADMIRAL DAVlS: Space Command serves as our focal\npoint for that, and they work closely with the battle\ngroups as they deploy to ensure that the battle group is\nable to use to its maximum advantage the existing\nspace systems.\nGENERAL ASHY: Roger, how about you? Tell us\nabout Air Force training programs.\nGENERAL DEKOK: Yes, Sir. It\'s sort of a dual program. Much of our basic training and education in\nspace is done by Air Education and Training Com-\n\nNATIONAL\n\nmand. Its been well institutionalized\nwith literally\nthousands of graduates over the years who have gone\nthrough our various training and education courses that\ntake our people up through what we call our initial\nqualification\ntraining, which is just short of being\nmission ready and able to operate our systems. I believe that\'s well institutionalized.\nIn the past several\nyears we\'ve transitioned\nvirtually all of that capability,\nsome of which used to be organic to Air Force Space\nCommand, to Air Education and Training Command.\nThey\'re in the process of establishing\na space university, so to speak, at Vandenberg Air Force Base.\nMuch of that has been transitioned.\nWe also have made those courses available to\nmembers of the other services. More recently, the Air\nForce Space Warfare Center has embarked on a wide\nvariety of more operationally\noriented training programs dedicated to space tactics and procedures that\nhave been developed under Brigadier General Vesely\nout at the Space Warfare Center. They vary from a\ncouple of days in duration all the way to almost four\nmonths for one of the newer courses, which is our\nspace tactics course. It\'s an elite course that we\'ve\ndeveloped for very select individuals which then can\nbe populated throughout the various Air Force elements as well as Unified commands around the world.\nWe\'re quite pleased with that. In fact, we\'re in dialogue with Air Combat Command as we work right\nnow, to see if we can even get toward a goal of joint\ngraduation of our courses in order to further integrate\nspace and air operations.\nGENERAL ASHY: I need to help frame this question.\nSince I\'ve been here we\'ve done two operations specifically: Haiti and Southwest Asia again. From my\nperspective,\nhaving been on the other end of this\nthing, it was very interesting to see what the service\ncomponents\ndo to contribute to our land and air and\nsea capabilities to train people and put this stuff in\ntheir hands. And it takes some training. There\'s some\nwonderful examples in Haiti. I know Jay was in the\nmiddle of that. Maybe that\'ll help you, Jay, with the\nquestion.\nGENERAL GARNER: We deal with space a little bit\ndifferent. We see space as something that cuts horizontally and across the land warfare components so we do\nblack space mostly with our TENCAP organization,\nArmy Space Program Office. And most of the training\nin that is done at Ft. Huachuca because it\'s mostly\nintelligence related. And we put those organizations\ntogether. They deploy out to our cores and generally\nspeaking, the bulk of those people are trained at Ft.\nHuachuca, except some of the signals people who are\ntrained at Fort Worth.\nNow the other side of that is everything else in\nspace, which is white space to us. And that\'s done\nhere in Colorado Springs in Army Space under Colonel Paul Semmens and Colonel Bill Hoyman. Those\n\nSECIJRITY\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nare a variety of people from special operations people\nto signal people to air defenders to field artilleryman-and\nthey\'re trained individually in the tradeoff schools in each one of those stovepipes.\nThen we\nbring them here and they do unit-type training. So\nwhat we try to do is, when we then deploy, we try to\nmake the products that the warfighter gets really invisible to him. He just gets it, he wants this, and he gets\nit.\nWhen I say war fighter, I\'m not talking about a\nCINC. I\'m talking about the guy on the deck of a\nship, the guy in a cockpit, or the battalion and brigade\ncommander\nstanding at his tactical operations center\nfighting the current fight and planning the next fight.\nSo what we try to do, we don\'t launch into space, we\ndon\'t fly stuff in space, we do maintain ground terminals and most of those people are taught at Fort\nWorth, and ARSPACE\nis responsible\nfor the unit\ntraining for that. But what we truly try to do is collect\nall the things we need coming out of space, force some\ndesigns on the products that come out of there, process\nthat in a central place in a contingency team that we\nhave here, and then ship that out to the warfighter and\nlet it really sort of be invisible to him.\nDAVIS:\nOne other aspect that might be\nworth mentioning,\nthis is not training so much but\neducation. We\'ve really found this pays off. We, as\nyou know, have that at our Naval Post Graduate\nSchool. I mentioned to you earlier this Challenge\nAthena system and our focus is much like Jay\'s: How\ndo we bring the warfighter what he needs? But in the\nrequirements\nbusiness it\'s really essential that people\nunderstand space so they can help us use it effectively.\nThat Challenge Athena system that I mentioned to you,\nthat capability, really came through one of our post\ngraduate students who studied this at post graduate\nschool because he understood our need to put together\nsomething like that and also understood\nwe need an\naffordable system and was able to do that. So I think\ncontinuing that education, sponsored by the Joint Staff,\ndone at post graduate school but it\'s sponsored by\nthem, that\'s really paying off for all our services.\nADMIRAL\n\nGENERAL ASHY: Perhaps Jeff would like to comment. I see Jeff as a close colleague, but he\'s also a\nwarfighter and he provides very key services.\nSo the\nmerging of all of this is dependent on what you all\nhave talked about and that\'s training and educating\nourselves out of business in terms of educating warfighters as Jay pointed out. Before Jay talks again, I\nthink Gil spoke about this and from my perspective of\nbeing on the other end of this, we need to make it\nunderstandable\nand simple enough that people can\ncomprehend\nwhat it is we\'re talking about, what services we deliver, and, most importantly,\nwho to ask\nfor it. That\'s why we have space support teams. We\nhave them from the components\nand we have them\nfrom the Joint Staff. I hope sometime in the near fu113\n\n1 1TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nture we can get out of that business because, as all of\nthe speakers have stated, we will have people out\nthere, warfighters,\nat all levels to understand\nthis\nwhere they don\'t have to have a team come in and\nhelp them. Go ahead, Jay.\nGENERAL GARNER: I\'il give you a specific Army\nproblem with space, but I really think it\'s among the\nservices; it\'s a definite problem in the Army. Like\nGeneral Ashy said, we\'ve got a space support team.\nIt\'s general white space, we\'ve got our TENCAPs\nunits in black space, and they deploy every time we go\nsomewhere.\nAnd they learn a lot and they bring a lot\nback, and we do a lot of product improvements\nand\nbuilding other things because of what they learn, and\nwe bypass the acquisition system. Means really, if you\nwant acquisition reform, look how we do stuff for\ntoday\'s problems in space. And that is really a good\nprogram. It works.\nNow at Huntsville,\nI\'ve got space technologists\nand they\'re brilliant. They do great stuff; I mean,\nthey\'re out there just as busy as little bees doing all\nkinds of technology.\nBut I tell you what they\'re doing,\nthey\'re hobby shopping. Because what we haven\'t\ndone in the Army is link what we\'re doing currently in\nthe next two or three years out and how we really\nwant to fight this Army in the year 2010-2015,\nand\nsaid O.K. Based on that what are the architectures\nup\nthere we need and what are the poles up there we need\nso that the technologists\nwe have doing these things\nare really focused?\nAnd that\'s the bridge that we haven\'t put together\nin the Army. Last week I went to TRADOC and\ntalked to General Hartzog.\nHe and I both said we\'ve\nreally been remiss in our jobs because we\'re doing a\ngreat job today and we\'ve got a lot of smart people\nworking tomorrow,\nbut we really haven\'t given them\nthe concept of the principles of war for tomorrow and\nthe other things. So if you\'re looking at where something\'s sort of broken a little bit, it\'s right there.\nSo what happens, from my standpoint, you\'ve got\na lot of great things going to happen in the future of\nspace, but they\'re not necessarily driven by the operators because the operators haven\'t stepped up and said\nthis is how I\'m going to fight 15 or 20 years from\nnow and here\'s what I need. We\'re getting there.\nGENERAL ASHY: To add just a little bit more and\nwe\'ll get off this question, in the last six months we in\nthe Unified staff have been working very hard on a\nstory that\'s understandable\nin a format that\'s standard.\nNot that we\'re trying to over standardize,\nbut we\nstarted from scratch and we think we are probably at\nthe 95 percent solution level. We\'ve done this from\nthe Unified staff to the theater warfighters\nat the joint\nlevel and we\'ve given it to our components through\nthe space support teams to say here is the model based\non specific examples. Go out there and teach it and\ngive it and work with them and help them. You can\'t\n114\n\ntake away from it, but you can add to it and tailor it to\ntheir particular needs. So I think we\'re there, and I\'m\nvery proud of that. I think this will add to the understanding.\nFrom my perspective,\nthe people out there want to\nuse this stuff. They just don\'t understand\nit because\nthey don\'t know where to go and ask for it, and I\nthink we\'ve made great strides in that regard.\nWe have a question from a very distinguished\nperson among us. I\'m going to ask you to respond to\nit. Since the change in the world order, vis-a-vis the\nformer Soviet Union and the change in the possible\nICBM threat, why not pursue a general missile defense\nrather than a specific missile defense and therefore\ndiscourage proliferation\nof missiles to Third World\ncountries?\nGENERAL GARNER: General missiles...I\nwhat a general missile defense is...\n\ndon\'t\n\nGENERAL ASHY: I think that\'s the question.\ngo to general vs. theater and or national.\n\nknow\n\nWhy not\n\nGENERAL GARNER: Well, let me muck around on\nthat a little bit. Maybe I\'ll come up with the answer\n\nhe\n\nwants.\n\nFirst thing, I think right now you have to be careful in blending the theater missile defenses into an\nNMD thing, because if you do that you begin to get\nthem bound by the ABM Treaty, and I think you want\nto stay away from that as much as possible. And I\nwon\'t say any more than that. Right now we have to\nbe careful blending the two.\nThe second thing, what we call national missile\ndefense to us is a defense against ICBMs. But national\nmissile defense to say, the Japanese or the Europeans,\ncould be a theater missile defense problem. We don\'t\nhave that problem, but they do.\nThe third thing is then you say, "O.K., what are\nyou doing in national missile defense?"\nWe get in a\nlot of debates on whether or not there\'s a threat there.\nAll I can say is there\'s two scenarios. One\'s an accidental launch. We\'ve been living with that a long time\nand it hasn\'t happened yet, but with the turbulence\nwith the Soviet Union, you could probably say there\nmay be a little bit more increased risk there. I don\'t\nknow the answer to that.\nThe second one is a country or a rogue nation or\nsomeone that is a potential enemy now or a short time\nin the future getting the capability of having an ICBMtype missile. The problem we have in the intelligence\ncommunity,\nwhen we look at that we look at countries\nbeing able to do things within their own structure and\nindigenously.\nWe don\'t give credit for the transfer of\ncomponents\nor the transfer of knowledge.\nIt took this country about 17 or 18 years to build a\nmissile that went from I00 kilometers to 300 kilometers. But once we did all that and all that got out in\nliterature and all those components\ncan be bought, you\n\nNATIONAL\n\nhave things happening now where the North Koreans\ngo from 300 kilometers to 1,000 kilometers in about\n40 months. And now they\'re going to 5,000 kilometers. So I\'m just saying there is the capability to buy\nknowledge or to buy components\nand get there much\nquicker. How much quicker, I don\'t know.\nThe question then becomes, if I see a rogue nation\ndoing this, do I have enough warning time that I can\ngo out and put a capability down on the ground that\nwill protect this nation from that? Certainly, if you\nsee them testing, we\'ll know that immediately.\nIf he\nbuys a whole round, he has instant capability, and I\nthink we have fair knowledge that that\'s what going\non, but that\'s no guarantee.\nIf he\'s buying components\nor scientists or something like that, that\'s sometimes\nvirtually impossible to know. And it varies by region.\nSo I don\'t know the answer to national missile defense. I say, look, if you\'re worried about it and\nyou\'re worried about our vagaries of being able to\nhave enough knowledge on another country\'s capability and it\'s worth $3-4 billion to you, you ought to go\ndo it.\nCandidly, the problem the services have is none of\nthe services want to be the bill payer for that because\nwe\'re all hurting big time. None of us have enough\nmoney to modernize our future force. So I don\'t know\nthat we\'re resistive to it, we\'re just worried about\nwhere the money comes from.\nI don\'t think that answers your question, but I\ndon\'t think until you solve the treaty stuff and you do\nthe right negotiations\nyou can go into a general missile\ndefense, and right now I\'m leary of blurring the two\ntogether. I think we\'d miss a lot of capability on the\nlower end of the spectrum if we do that.\n\nSECURITY\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nIN SPACE\n\nsecretary of the United States Air Force. If you go\nahead and exit through the back doors and go across\nthe hall, there\'s some alphabetical\nlistings where your\nseating arrangements\nare. We will reconvene here at\n1:30 promptly. Thank you very much.\n\nGENERAL ASHY: But missile defense, I know you\nwould agree with this because we\'ve talked about it,\nmissile defense is missile defense and we\'ve got to\naddress it.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nthat was the last question.\nI\'d like to thank Mr. Harris and our other panel members for being with us. I\'d like to thank all of you in\nthe civil and commercial\nsectors for your partnership\nand your support. I\'d like to thank the Foundation.\nI\'d\nlike to thank my colleague, Dave, thanks a bunch, and\nall of you for being here. Thank you very much.\nDAVID PAYNE: I\'d like to thank the distinguished\nspeakers for their candor and their insights and their\ndedication to America\'s\nfuture. And a special thanks to\nGeneral Ashy for moderating this session.\nThe yellow forms out there are surveys, and if you\nwould care to fill those out for the Foundation,\nwe\'ve\ngot some boxes in the back or you can hand them to\nme or any of the volunteers.\nOur next event is our luncheon, and this is cosponsored by Spectrum Astro and EOSAT with the\nSpace Foundation.\nThe speaker at the luncheon, we\'re\nvery lucky to have the Honorable Sheila Widnall, the\n115\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nLuncheon\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nPresentation\n\nFeatured\n\nThe Honorable\n\nSpeaker:\n\nSecretary\n\nSheila E. Widnall\n\nof the Air Force\n\nMost of you think I came here today just to speak\nat this luncheon. While that is true, there\'s another\nreason I\'m here. As many of you know, we\'re in the\nmiddle of a huge Pentagon renovation.\nMy office\nhappens to be in Wedge 1, which means we\'re the\nfirst to move out. They say we can move back in\nabout 10 years, so I\'m relocating the entire Air Staff\nhere to the Broadmoor Hotel. (So much for wishful\nthinking!)\nI am excited at the opportunity\nto speak to you\ntoday because I have lots of good news concerning the\nspace business that should interest you all. As many of\nyou know, last year I announced three goals in the\nspace arena:\nFirst,\n\nmake space support\n\nto the warfighter\n\nrou-\n\ntine.\nSecond, improve military cooperation\nwith civilian\nspace efforts.\nThird, make space launch routine and affordable.\nToday I want to give you a progress report on\nhow the Air Force is doing toward reaching the second\nand third goals. I\'m going to focus any remarks on\ncommercial\ncooperation\nand space launch because\nlaunch vehicles, particularly\nthe commercial\nlaunch\nvehicles, promise the highest dividend for America.\nThis will be an easy talk for you to listen to, because you only have to remember one thing. That one\nthing is that the Air Force has officially ended the\nstudy phase of improving our space launch situation,\nand we\'re aggressively\npursuing the action phase.\nThe reason for my focus on space launch is simple: In 1980, America had 100 percent of the launch\nvehicle market. Today we have 30 percent. I\'m going\nto do my best to make sure 1995 is the year we start\nto reverse this trend! Reversing this trend will require\na national effort and tremendous\ncooperation\nbetween\nthe Air Force and the commercial\nspace launch industry. Without a cooperative\nnational effort, the trend I\njust mentioned will not improve.\nThe good news is we already have an incredible\namount of cooperation\nbetween the Air Force and\ncommercial\nspace at our launch sites.\nAmount of Commercial\nActivity at Cape Canaveral\nSome of you may have heard me talk about the\nnew California Spaceport at Vandenberg\nAir Force\nBase. I\'m happy to announce that several weeks ago\nwe signed a 25-year lease with the Western\nCommercial\nSpace Center. They plan to build facilities\nto launch a variety of small commercial\nlaunch vehicles.\n\n116\n\nHowever, the lion\'s share of Air Force interaction\nwith commercial\nspace occurs at Cape Canaveral.\nIn\nfact last year was a historic transition year for space\nlaunch in Florida. In the past, military space launches\nsignificantly outnumbered\ncommercial\nlaunches. However, in 1994 for the first time ever, the split was\n50/50. In fact, three out of three Atlas II launches and\none of three Delta launches were commercial.\nThese\nlaunches supported Intelsat, DirecTV, and Galaxy.\n\n1995 will be first year commercial\nactually outnumber\n\nlaunches\n\nmilitary launches.\n\n1995 will be first year commercial\nlaunches actually outnumber military launches. Of 11 Atlas\nlaunches, nine will be commercial.\nOf 19 East Coast\nmissions planned, 12 are commercial.\nCommercial\nmissions on the manifest include three Intelsats and\nseveral other communication\nsatellites.\nCommercial\nlaunches at Cape will outpace military\nlaunches for the rest of the decade. Of the 111\nplanned, 69 are commercial\nmissions. In fact, between\nthe early and late parts of the 1990s, the 30/70 civilian/military\nlaunch mix will flip-flop, with 60 to 70\npercent of EELV launches in the late \'90s going commercial.\nAF Contributions\nat Cape\nWith all this commercial\nactivity predicted for the\nfuture, the Air Force is working hand in hand with\nindustry to make access to space easier. In the spirit of\ncooperation and commercialization,\nwe\'ve made our\nAtlas and Delta launch pads available to commercial\nusers on a non-interference basis. This cooperation\nhas\nsaved rocket companies the cost of duplicating some\nvery expensive infrastructure.\nAdditionally, the 45th Space Wing adopted four\ninitiatives to facilitate commercial space. First, they\nhave improved dialogue with industry. Second, they\nimproved the cost accounting system, abolishing indirect costs and unit service charges, and they are evaluating fixed price arrangements.\nThird, they are simplifying procedures by standardizing\nand reducing documentation requirements.\nFinally, they are allowing\ncivilian use of government\nfacilities which are excess\nto our needs.\nAlso, our Range Standardization\nand Automation\n(RSA) program is investing over a billion dollars to\nlower operating costs of ranges, modernize utilities,\nfix roads, and upgrade range infrastructure.\nThe good\nnews for the commercial\nspace industry is that every\n\nLUNCHEON\n\ntime we spend a dime upgrading our infrastructure,\ncommercial\nspace wins since it will be an extensive\nuser of the range.\nHistorical Context\nBut perhaps the most important contribution\nthe\nAir Force can make is our Evolved Expendable\nLaunch Vehicle program, more commonly known as\nEELV. I think the best way to begin the discussion of\nthe EELV program is to put things in a historical\ncontext. Not too long ago, America was the free world\nleader in the launch vehicle business. The biggest\ncustomer was the U.S. government,\nwhose business\npractices and priorities are fundamentally\ndifferent\nthan commercial\npractices. One only has to look at\ncommercial\nlaunch practices regarding insurance, risk\naversion, and launch operations manning to see stark\ndifferences.\nAs most of you know, our boosters are ICBM\nderivatives,\nnot "clean sheet" commercial\nspacelift\nvehicles. The trade-offs we made back in the \'50s to\ndeliver warheads 4,000 miles away with precision are\nprobably not the same trades we\'d make to develop an\naffordable spacelift capability.\nAdditionally,\nI suppose it\'s an American aerospace\ndesign standard to push for cutting edge technical\nsolutions which add performance\nonly at the margin at\nsignificant additive cost. While this is a great philosophy when you\'re designing systems which are essential\nto the defense of America, it may not bode well for\nprofitability.\nWe are changing this paradigm for the\nEELV program.\nLet me give you one example. Some of our rocket\nengines, like the shuttle main engine, operate at the\nupper limit of performance.\nWe achieve this outstanding performance\nby hand tooling, exotic materials,\nand\ncustomizing\neach engine. The trouble is that last 10\npercent of engine performance\ncosts us a lot of money.\nIn the launch vehicle business, we have never designed\nto cost. Likewise, we have never designed for the\nexpress purpose of launching commercial satellites.\nUnfortunately\nthere is someone who has!\nImpressions\nof French Guiana\nI had the opportunity\nto stop by the Ariane launch\nfacility at Kourou, French Guiana, a few months ago.\nI saw what the French do and was very impressed by\nthe launch vehicle processing streamlining.\nThe question is, what can we do? How do we\nmake it more attractive for our own satellite builders\nand buyers to launch American versus going off\nshore? How do we make it simpler, less costly, better?\nLet me give you an example. When the French were\ndesigning the Ariane 5, they selected their rocket\nengine from proven technology,\nnot nearly as complex\nas the Space Shuttle main engine. The French didn\'t\nwant to spend scarce development\ndollars pushing the\nstate-of-the-art\nrocket engines, when an existing one\nmet the requirements\nat minimal risk.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nThere\'s a lesson to be learned here. Although the\nAir Force will be designing a new booster to meet Air\nForce requirements,\nwe must factor commercial\nrequirements into our trade studies. Just as the European\nSpace Agency realized, we too must reduce launch\ncycle times and minimize manpower.\nWe must break\nthat American paradigm of choosing the most technically elegant solution and instead choose the most costeffective solution.\nThere are certainly differences between Ariane and\nthe Air Force. Ariane had a 12-nation consortium\nsubsidize the development\ncosts of the booster and\nlaunch facilities. In fact, in Norm Augustine\'s\nrecent\ninterview with Aviation Week, he said, "One has to be\nvery concerned about the future of any industry where\nyour competitors\nare governments,\nregardless of the\nbusiness you\'re in." Although the Air Force is only\none agency of a single nation, we\'re certainly doing\nour part to build a world-class\nlaunch system.\n\nWe must break that American\n\nparadigm\n\nchoosing the most technically\n\nof\n\nelegant\n\nsolution and instead choose the most costeffective\n\nsolution.\n\nThere\'s another important difference.\nAriane has\none launch pad, one launch team, one launch vehicle\nproduction,\nand one range. We have 11 launch pads,\nfive launch teams, three launch vehicle production,\nand two ranges. I think these metrics confirm General\nMoorman\'s\nconclusion that there is overcapacity\nin our\nlaunch vehicle business. If we\'re successful in the\nEELV program, we should be able to focus our capacity and put this country back on track toward the top\nin the launch vehicle business.\nEELV\nThe central question then is how will the Air\nForce\'s EELV program improve America\'s\ncompetitiveness in the international\nlaunch vehicle business?\nLet me answer that question with two important\npoints:\n- One, we\'re not just building a booster, we\'re\nbuilding a system.\n- Two, we\'re not just building an Air Force system, we\'re building an American system.\nThe EELV system will be a national resource, equally\nviable as a commercial\nor a military booster. And\nwe\'re designing and building this system with Air\nForce budget, infrastructure,\nand personnel.\nDon\'t get me wrong. The DoD is not financing\nunique commercial\nEELV requirements.\nBut we certainly won\'t stand in the way of the winning EELV\nbuilder offering the EELV family to the commercial\n117\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nmarket. Just as in the case of commercial\nAtlas or\ncommercial\nDelta, the only difference between the\ncommercial\nand military markets is capacity, not configuration.\nDepending on what angle you look at it, the EELV\nprogram is either building a commercial\nbooster the\nmilitary can use, or a military booster the commercial\nindustry can use. This unique aspect of the launch\nvehicle industry makes it the epitome of "dual use\ntechnology. "\nThe primary objective for the EELV program is to\nreduce total cost for medium and heavy space launch\nvehicles. One way is to build the system to commercial standards, minimizing\nmilitary specifications\nand\npaperwork.\nAnother big challenge will be to build something\nthat is responsive to commercial\ncycle times. Typically, commercial\nusers want to launch on schedule,\nsince time is money. Conversely,\nmilitary users want\nto launch on need. Currently we achieve a 50-day\ncycle time for Atlas, a 28-day cycle time for Delta,\nand somewhat longer for Titan. We must achieve 30\ndays or less for EELV.\nI\'m happy to report we are making good progress\non EELV. I was briefed on the acquisition approach\nseveral months ago. We\'re hoping to put the RFP on\nthe street soon, and award multiple contracts this summer. We plan to downselect\nto a single contractor\nteams by the end of 1997. We are minimizing government specs and standards, maximizing\ncommercial\nperformance\nstandards and specs, and conducting\nfrequent and early discussions with industry.\nIn the report we are about to send to Congress, we\nsaid our biggest concern for this program was whether\nwe had enough money for this program. Let me say\nfor the record, it has to be! You know the likelihood\nof the Air Force receiving more money as well as I\ndo, so you must also know what a high priority we\'ll\nassign to affordability.\nWe need proven technology,\nwithout a lot of cost risk.\nI have confidence in American ingenuity to figure\nout how to improve U.S. competitiveness\nwhile staying within this cost target. After all, we had over\n600,000 folks in uniform in 1986--now\nwe have\n400,000. If we can figure out how to execute an expanding mission with only two-thirds the manpower,\nwe ought to be able to figure out how to build an\ninexpensive booster!\nNASA Reusable Concepts\nNow I know when it comes to the question of how\nto build a cheap booster, there are two camps--expendable and reusable. I\'ve read several interesting articles concerning the merits of reusable launch vehicles.\nAnd the engineer in me would love to see reusable\nlaunch vehicle technology\ncome up with a breakthrough that makes getting to space inexpensive.\nHowever, I\'m also the Secretary of the Air Force\nwith a duty to make sure we have assured access to\n118\n\nspace. In my opinion, the national space transportation\npolicy signed by President Clinton has the correct\nanswer--we\nneed equally viable expendable and reusable launch vehicle efforts to cover our bets for the\nfuture.\nI don\'t want to repeat the mistake we made in the\nearly \'80s of having all our eggs in one basket. That\'s\nwhy the Air Force is vigorously pursuing the EELV\nprogram.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.. the EELV program\ncommercial\n\nis either building a\n\nbooster the military can use, or a\n\nmilitary booster the commercial\n\nindustry can\n\nuse. This unique aspect of the launch vehicle\nindustry makes it the epitome\n\nof "dual\n\nuse\n\ntechnology."\n\nThat\'s about all I have to say on the launch vehicle\nfront, but before I close, let me quickly mention two\nother items. I know everyone here has heard of information dominance,\nglobal presence, and the contribution of space in the information\nwarfare business. An\nAir Force Space Command blue ribbon panel on space\nin the 21st century reported that: "Information\ndominance can only be achieved through the control and\nexploitation of space, which in the 21st century will be\nthe prerequisite\nfor victory in surface operations."\nA key program to help us achieve information\ndominance is our new space-based\ninfrared systems.\nI\'m happy to report that we\'ve also managed to get\nthis program out of the study phase and into the action\nphase. This program, like the Defense Support Program, will provide all joint warfighters\nthe earliest\nwarning of ballistic missile attack.\nThis will be a streamlined\nacquisition similar to\nEELV. The RFP went out in February;\nwe just received several proposals, and we plan to award contracts this summer. This program has additional significance because we recently signed an agreement between the Air Force and NRO for unprecedented\ncooperation. SBIR is truly an integrated,\nnational program!\nSpace Management\nThe other item I wanted to touch on is the progress we\'ve made in the space management\narena. The\nDeputy Secretary of Defense recently approved Deputy\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Space Reporting to\nPaul Kaminski. He also agreed to form a DoD space\narchitect office within the Air Force reporting to the\nAir Force Acquisition\nExecutive.\nEventually,\nwe plan\nto merge the architect functions for the DoD and\nNRO.\nThis has been labeled a congressional\nissue, a\nroles and missions issue, and a reinventing\ngovernment\nissue. A few have questioned Air Force motives, and\n\nLUNCHEON\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nwhether or not we can be trusted to satisfy other services requirements.\nI say let the following facts speak\nfor themselves.\nThe Air Force spends $6 billion dollars of its TOA\non space. We\'re using our TOA to satisfy the joint\nwarfighter\ncustomer. We buy boosters to launch AF,\nNRO, and Navy satellites. We build communication\nsatellites that carry Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine messages. Seventy percent of the MILSTAR satellite capacity, which we funded entirely out of the Air\nForce budget, carries messages to Joint Task Force\nground commanders.\nWe buy space-based\ninfrared\nsatellites to warn soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen\nof incoming SCUD missiles.\nWith $6 Billion of extra TOA per year, we could\nbuy more B-2s, accelerate the F-22, and deliver the\nC-17 faster - but we don\'t. We believe space is a core\ncompetence of the United States Air Force, and we put\nour money where our mouth is.\nConclusion\nThe launch vehicle plans, space-based infrared\nsatellite program, and the space management issue are\nall contentious\nissues we\'ve faced since I arrived at the\nPentagon. I\'m happy to report we have made great\nprogress in resolving them. In case you haven\'t noticed, I\'m the strongest advocate for space in the\nDepartment\nof Defense. I truly believe space is one of\nthe Air Force\'s core competencies,\nand I will continue\nto do my best to ensure the Air Force provides the\nbest space capabilities to the joint team.\n\n119\n\n11TH\n\nThe\n\nNATIONAL\n\nWorld\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nIs Into\n\nSpace\n\nMaster\nModerator:\n\nDavid L.

PAYNE: We have an excellent afternoon session,\nand it will celebrate the world as a space-faring\nplanet.\nTo introduce Dan Goldin, it\'s my pleasure to introduce General Jim Hill.\nGENERAL HILL: Thank you, Dave, and again I welcome you to this session of the 1lth National Space\nSymposium.\nIn April of 1992 Daniel S. Goldin became the ninth NASA administrator\nand immediately\nestablished himself as a leader for change by bringing\nreform and revitalization\nto America\'s\nspace agency.\nMr. Goldin has focused on streamlining\nthe agency\nand creating a more business-like\napproach with budgetary reforms and the best establishment\nof the\n"faster, better, cheaper" philosophy for space. Under\nthe leadership of President Clinton and Vice President\nGore, Mr. Goldin has been boldly promoting cooperation with his counterpart\nYuri Koptev of the Russian\nSpace Agency.\nPrior to assuming his current position, Mr. Goldin\nwas the vice president and general manager of the\nTRW Space and Technology\nGroup. During his 25\nyear career at TRW, he successfully\nmanaged the\ndevelopment\nand production of numerous advanced\nspacecraft and space instruments.\nMr. Goldin began\n\n120\n\nhis career as a research scientist at NASA after graduating with a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering from the City College of New York. It is my\ndistinct pleasure to introduce one of the world\'s great\nchampions of space, Mr. Dan Goldin.\n\nI\'m going to take you on a trip to the\nfuture--to\n\nthe year 2020. I\'m going to give\n\nyou a picture of where the world could be in\nspace.\n\nMR. GOLDIN: I\'m going to take you on a trip to the\nfuture--to\nthe year 2020. I\'m going to give you a\npicture of where the world could be in space. I want\nto talk about the brilliant and the breathtaking,\nbecause\nthat\'s what the world is capable of.\nIf there was any doubt about the miracles the\nworld can do in space, they were put to rest two\nmonths ago. In a celestial ballet that riveted the world,\nin February, the Shuttle came within a wing\'s length\nof the Russian Mir space station. This was a miracle\n\nTHE\n\nof technology and a powerful symbol of the new trust\nbetween the United States and Russia.\nIt\'s a trust we\'ve helped build through cooperation\nin space. This trust--and\nthe trust we\'ve built with all\nof our international\npartners--is\ngoing to open a new\nera in space. A new era in international\ncooperation.\nA\nnew era in science and technology.\nA bold new era in\nexploration.\nBut before I lay out a vision of where the world\ncould be in the future, I want to tell you why there is\na vision at all. You see, I think it\'s easy for us to get\ncaught up in our own ideas and excitement about\nspace. We can forget what\'s behind it all. We can\nforget the real reason for any space policy or program.\nIt\'s for the children, plain and simple. It\'s for the\nnext generation,\nwho will lead the world into the new\nmillennium.\nBoldly expanding the frontiers of space,\nand driving the science and technology it takes to get\nthere, is one of the most important investments we can\nmake in our children.\nIn every spacefaring\ncountry in the world, people\nsay, "How can we talk about doing things in\nspace--going\nto the moon or Mars or a comet or an\nasteroid--when\npeople are starving?" Of course the\nworld needs to take care of its people. They need\nfood, shelter, health care and many other things.\nBut they also need a future of hope. The world\'s\nchildren will need the technologies,\nscience, jobs,\nindustries,\ninternational\nskills and inspiration that flow\nfrom the exploration\nof space. These skills and benefits aren\'t luxuries. They\'re essential to success in the\n21 st century.\nI\'m going to give you a picture of how space\nexploration\ncould touch the world in the year 2020.\nLet me take you on a fantasy trip and talk about what\nmight be.\nIn the year 2020, the Mars 2 crew has just returned. They\'ve come back to Earth and home to their\nrespective countries. The crew commander\nis holding\na press conference to talk about some of the astounding findings from this three-year journey.\nAs the crew commander\nsteps up to the microphones, the world, and the world\'s children, watch.\nShe begins to speak. She has some incredible news.\nHer crew brought back some core drillings and rocks\nfrom the ancient lake beds of Mars.\nWhen they first surveyed the area, they couldn\'t\nfind any signs of life--just\nlike the Viking mission.\nBut the astronauts learned something from scientists in\nthe 1990s, who cracked open the rocks of the barren\nAntarctica and found lichens. The astronauts cracked\nopen the rocks of Mars, took out their microscopes,\nand found something amazing, too.\nThey found fossils of elemental cells. We reconstructed these cells in a lab and found elements of\nproteins similar to what\'s on Earth. These are the\nbuilding blocks of life. This is exciting because we\'d\nalso found something similar in comet samples. Now\n\nWORLD\n\nIS INTO\n\nSPACE\n\nwe\'re beginning to speculate that there was a comet\nflood on Earth and Mars simultaneously,\nwhich carried\nbasic proteins--the\ncosmic soup.\nFor the first half billion, or billion years, Earth\nand Mars had a similar evolution.\nElemental forms of\nlife developed on both planets. But we didn\'t get this\nconnection until now, the year 2020. We didn\'t know\nwhere that first elemental cell came from until the\nastronauts found it on Mars.\n\nImagine\n\nit. These astronauts\n\none of the secrets\n\nof creation.\n\nhave unlocked\nThe children\n\nthe world have a new connection\nuniverse,\n\nand new knowledge\n\nof\n\nwith their\nabout the\n\norigins of life.\n\nImagine it. These\nthe secrets of creation.\na new connection with\nedge about the origins\nlife and for themselves\nhad.\n\nastronauts have unlocked one of\nThe children of the world have\ntheir universe, and new knowlof life. They have a context for\nno generation before has ever\n\nThe decision to go to Mars also brought the world\npractical benefits.\nSpace agencies had to develop revolutionary\nsystems to get to Mars. The astronauts were gone for\nthree years altogether.\nWe had to develop systems that\ncould keep the air and water in their rocket clean and\nlife-supporting.\nThese systems have had a tremendous\neffect on\nEarth. Knowing how to filter out impurities in water\nand air has given us a much cleaner, safer environment.\nSome of the systems we developed to purify and\nrecycle liquid aboard the international\nSpace Station,\nand then on the trip to Mars, are now used on Earth.\nThey\'re used throughout Alaska to protect permafrost\nand tundra and to provide a more robust sanitary system there.\nSpace agencies also developed incredible medical\nsystems. Our astronauts couldn\'t take hospitals or\ndoctors with them to Mars. So we developed chemical\nsurgery techniques that could heal sick astronauts\nwithout scalpels or incisions. We put micromachines\ninto their bodies that doctors could manipulate from\nthe ground.\nWay back in 1995, these little machines were only\na concept in the minds of engineers and scientists at\nspace agencies and research institutes around the\nworld. Today, they can monitor what\'s happening in\nthe body, and carry antibodies directly to a certain part\nof the body. Or go directly to where a medical problem has begun and resolve it.\n\n121\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nThat means that here on Earth, medical care is\nmore accessible, less expensive and less intrusive than\nit\'s ever been. The same kind of vital sensors we put\ninto the bodies of astronauts to monitor, diagnose and\ntreat them from the ground are used throughout the\nworld. They can monitor a person\'s health and vital\nfunctions from a prenatal period to old age.\nThey\'re used by surgeons to make prenatal corrections. They\'re used to continually monitor the elderly.\nIf something goes wrong, a doctor is on the phone or\nanother interactive system with a patient within minutes. People in remote villages around the world now\nhave access to high-quality\nhealth care. We are diagnosed and treated in our homes. A hospital stay is the\nexception.\nAnd here\'s the connection with the world\'s children. Young people across the globe helped us design\nthese medical and life-supporting\nsystems and test\nthem. University students wrote proposals for NASA\nand other space agencies, working in collaboration\nwith their peers across the globe. Junior high and high\nschool students ran experiments\non closed-loop systems, testing air and water purity. Elementary\nschool\nchildren collected data on the heart rate and vital signs\nof the human subjects in these experiments.\nThey were doing real research with a real purpose.\nThese children had a stake in the trip to Mars. When\nthe astronauts landed, the world\'s schoolchildren\nfelt\nmore than the thrill of this moment. They felt a sense\nof accomplishment\nand connectedness.\nThey helped\nmake it happen.\nScientists and students learned much of what it\ntook to get to Mars through the international\nSpace\nStation. It was our stepping stone to deep space. It\'s\nwhere we learned how human beings could live and\nwork safely and efficiently in space for long periods.\nIt was the next link in the human adventure in space.\nThe Station also gave researchers\nand students\nlong-term access to experimenting\nin microgravity.\nThe insights and new knowledge gained in the areas of\nmedicine and materials has been astounding.\nFew\nthings have added to what the world does in science\nand technology as dramatically\nas the international\nSpace Station.\nThe Station is also where the world learned how to\nwork together on complex projects.\nEvery student in the year 2020 benefits from the\nnew international\npartnerships\nthat have blossomed\nsince then. Children in science, math, language, history and social studies classes collaborate with their\npeers from around the world.\nIt\'s hard to imagine the loss of all the opportunities the Space Station has given us in the year 2020.\nIn the year 2020, every freshman engineering\nstudent can tell you about the revolution that\'s occurred in spacecraft design.\nBack in the early 1990s, spacecraft were the size\nof a tractor-trailer.\nThey weighed 40,000 pounds and\n\n122\n\ntook a decade to build. But a revolution started in the\nmid-1990s.\nSpacecraft were shrunk by orders of magnitude. By the turn of the century, many of them\nweighed tens of kilograms and cost tens of millions of\ndollars, not ten times that. They were built on desktops, not high bay areas. We launched dozens a year\nto explore the universe.\nA mother spacecraft would drop swarms of even\nsmaller spacecraft out to measure the environment\nof a\nplanet, and they\'d radio back information.\nAn international\nchallenge has been issued to increase their capacity. If freshmen engineering\nstudents\naren\'t working on it in class, they\'re communicating\nwith their computers at home. They\'re working furiously to improve the resolution of spacecraft images,\ntheir ability to detect color, and other capacities.\nOther spacecraft developed by space agencies are\nself-healing,\nlike the human body. We had to develop\nspacecraft that could detect and fix problems. Our\nMars crew was too far away to have to depend on\nexperts on the ground.\nAnother part of getting to Mars was learning how\nto live off the land. Successful expeditions on Earth\nlived off the land, instead of trying to take all their\nsupplies with them. The same thing is true in space.\nSpace agencies launched robotic probes. We extracted resources from the atmosphere\nand land to\nbuild up stores of breathing gases and fuel. We can\nuse this fuel to power our mobile vehicles to heat and\ncool. We learned how to plant gardens on Mars. All\nwe brought were seeds.\nIn the 1990s, it took two acres to provide the\nproper nutrition for one person. It was too costly and\ntoo difficult to carry the supplies needed to do that to\nMars. So we figured out how to do it in tens of square\nmeters instead. And these crops are much more productive. They have more nutritional value. Vegetables\ncan provide the full value of amino acids.\nEvery child in the world has reaped the benefits of\nthe new reusable launch vehicle. This is what made\nthe development\nof space affordable. It opened up the\nheavens to space exploration and commercial\nutilization. Now, of course, there is a constellation\nof outposts in space, built and operated by international\npartnerships\nof industry, governments,\nand university\nstudents and faculty.\nIn 2020, students are doing such sophisticated\nenvironmental\nmonitoring that their data is no longer\nfed into a central system for scientists to use. It\'s part\nof a distributed system that\'s used by policy makers\naround the globe. School children don\'t just have\naccess to global environmental\nconferences.\nThey\nparticipate.\nThey present their findings, models and\nproposals.\nThis worldwide program has its roots in the\nGLOBE program. That was one of the ways NASA\ninvested in America\'s\nchildren in the 1990s. Back\nthen, it was a national program, not an international\n\nTHE\nWORLD SPACE\nISINTO\none--ajoint effortby NASA,NOAA, EPAandother\nagencies.\nChildren to selecta plot of land,30meters\ngot\nby\n30 meters. heyput a stakein thegroundandclaimed\nT\nit.

There may be another\nplanet in the universe.\n\nThis is\n\nbreathtaking.\n\nElementary\nclassrooms around the world display a\nlarge, glossy photograph.\nIt\'s a picture of a blue planet\nwith clouds. This planet is circling a star somewhere\nbeyond Alpha Centuri. Teachers point out that because\nof the color of its oceans, it may be life-bearing.\nImagine that. There may be another life-bearing planet\nin the universe. This is breathtaking.\nThese children are dazzled. They stand in front of\nthese pictures and see the shapes and patterns, the\nwater and land mass, of this startling planet worlds\naway from Earth. They wonder what form of life\nexists there, or if humans will ever live there.\nBefore NASA and other space agencies took these\npictures, we did chemical analyses of this planet\'s\natmosphere.\nThat told us there was abundant oxygen,\ncarbon dioxide, methane and water vapor there. The\npictures confirmed that. And because the resolution of\nthese pictures is so high, we can actually see continents.\nLet\'s take a look at an 8th-grade class. The students are trilingual,\nof course, so it\'s not easy to tell\njust by listening what country they\'re from. As part of\ntheir science class, they\'re operating robots on the\nmoons of Mars with students from their "sister\nschool" on another continent.\nIf we listen to them talking, we find that they\'re\nconnected, really connected, to exploration.\nThey\'re\ndoing it. They operate these robots by remote control.\nThey see what the robot sees, as it moves over the\nMartian lunar terrain. They\'re excited. It makes a\ndifference to them.\nSome of these children will be excited about science and discovery all of their lives. Many of them\nwill stay curious and interested about their universe.\nMaybe about other things, too. They\'ll be hooked on\ndiscovery. They\'ll be open to wonder.\nThe high school classes of 2020 are also active.\nThey analyze samples returned from comets, asteroids\nand other planetary bodies, and put the results on the\n\nInternet. The science they do gets shared\nand scientists around the world.\n\nwith students\n\nYou may think I\'ve had a little fun with you this\nafternoon. You may think all this is pie-in-the-sky.\nIt\nisn\'t. The vignettes I\'ve given you--and\nother ones as\nwell--could\nreally happen.\nThe international\nSpace Station is the next big\nstep. The Station is what will make possible the human\njourney into deep space.\nNASA is working toward the vision I\'ve described. And we are also getting ourselves ready for the\n21st century. We are dramatically\nrestructuring\nthe\nAgency to be more mobile, agile and responsive.\nWe\nhave five major reviews going on now of our missions, people and facilities. We are examining everything we do.\nWe\'re cutting out overlap and redundancy.\nWe\'re\nconsolidating.\nWe\'re looking to privatize whatever\nmakes sense to privatize. We are getting back to being\nan R&D Agency and out of the operations business.\nWe\'re going to do what we do best, and let the rest\ngo. We\'re doing things "better, faster and cheaper."\nWe\'re doing more with less. We\'re giving taxpayers a\nbigger bang for their buck than ever before.\n\nSpace is vital to the world\'s future.\ntechnologies\nbenefits\n\nwe develop to get there, the\n\nwe bring back, and the international\n\npartnerships\n\nwe forge in the process\n\ntools of the future.\nchildren\n\nThe\n\nare the\n\nThey are tools our\n\nwill desperately\n\nneed to succeed\n\nin\n\nthe 21 st century.\n\nIn other words, we are revolutionizing\nNASA.\nNASA will be ready for the 21st century. NASA will\nbe ready to work with other nations to give the\nworld\'s children what they\'ll need in the new millennium.\nI don\'t know what new technologies\nand breakthroughs long-term access to microgravity\nwill yield. I\ndon\'t know for certain the technologies\nwe\'ll gain\nfrom sending a human expedition to Mars, an asteroid,\na comet, or where ever we decide to go. I can\'t predict, either, where those technologies\nwill take our\nchildren or what industries and jobs they\'ll foster.\nBut I do know this. Space is vital to the world\'s\nfuture. The technologies\nwe develop to get there, the\nbenefits we bring back, and the international\npartnerships we forge in the process are the tools of the future. They are tools our children will desperately need\nto succeed in the 21st century.\nFor the last 35 years, we have defined the space\nfrontier. Now, we\'re going to open that frontier.\nWe\'re going to do it for the world\'s children.

They are an extremely valuable\nasset to us as we go about planning a future that includes a bright future for space activities.\nI believe that it\'s time we recognize that space has\nto be regarded not just as an item in a $1.5 trillion\nfederal budget, but has to be thought about in light of\na $6 trillion national economy. I believe we have an\nopportunity to begin to think of space as one of those\neconomic frontiers where the United States must not\n\nother committees of the Congress that have an application. I\'m going to try to work with those chairmen and\nmake certain we think of space as a real opportunity\nfor us all.\nAs I said, there are some things the government\ndoes that are very important. We\'re embarking upon a\nprogram to try to build reasonable launch vehicles. I\nbelieve those have a chance of dramatically\ncutting the\ncost of getting to space. That, of course, would be\nvery appealing to people who want to have a future in\ncommercial\nspace. I also believe that the Space Station\nis an extremely important part of what we do for our\nspace future. If human beings are to spend long duration periods in space, we\'ve got to learn what that\nmeans in terms of life science, and they will be able to\ndo that aboard the Space Station. The fact that we\'re\ndoing that internationally\nnow with the Russians means\nwe can take advantage of a lot of what they have\nlearned over the last three decades in space and what\nwe\'ve learned in space and combine those two learning\ncurves in a way that benefits both nations. I believe\nultimately that the Space Station will prove to be an\nextremely valuable laboratory,\none in which probably\nNobel Prizes will be won when we begin to realize the\nnature of space and the fact that it is a very different\nplace to do experimentation.\nI think that\'s all very exciting, and it\'s things that\nNASA can be involved in. But I have to tell you,\nwe\'re going to be doing this in a very, very tough\nbudget climate, because I am convinced we\'re going to\nsee a budget come forward by May that will balance\nthe budget of the federal government\nby the year\n2002. To do so, science, space and technology programs will all be involved in the restructuring\nthat will\nhave to take place in government\nin order to achieve\nthat goal.\nI see this as being a year of challenges.\nChallenges\nin our space future, challenges to make it work in a\nway in that we, as a society, participate totally in our\nspace future and do so within the concept of a balanced budget that ensures that our children don\'t end\nup paying the bills for what we do now.\nIt\'s all going to be very exciting and I look forward to working with all of you as we pursue the\ngoals.\n\nonly lead, but must dominate.\nTo do so, it seems to me we must go beyond just\nfederal spending programs.\nThere are some of those\nprograms that are important, but we need to begin to\nthink about the kinds of tax treatments of space activities that might encourage more people to invest in new\nkinds of launch vehicles, in new kinds of products\nmade in space.\nMy efforts are going to extend beyond just the\nwork of the Science Committee because I recognize\nthat there are things that go on in the Ways and Means\nCommittee that have an application to what we achieve\nin space. I recognize that there are things that go on in\n\nMR.

That\'s an awesome vision.\nWe thank you for your visionary comments,\nMr.\nGoldin.\nAnd now we have a special video address from the\nHonorable Bob Walker, the chairman of the Science\nCommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nI believe ultimately\n\nthat the Space Station will\n\nprove to be an extremely\none in which\n\nprobably\n\nvaluable\n\nlaboratory,\n\nNobel Prizes will be\n\nwon when we begin to realize\n\nthe nature of\n\nspace and the fact that it is a very different\nplace to do experimentation.\n\n124\n\nTHE\n\npresident of Lockheed Commercial\nSpace Company,\nwhere he was instrumental\nin developing several new\ncommercial\nlines of business for Lockheed, including\nremote sensing and space launch.\nDr. Dailey joined Lockheed after serving as executive secretary of the White House National Space\nCouncil where he was responsible for formulating\nand\ncoordinating\nUnited States\' civil, commercial\nand\nnational security space policy. Prior to his appointment\nby President Bush, Dr. Dailey served as senior staff\nmember for the Senate Armed Services Committee.\nDr. Dailey is a graduate of the University of\nSouthern California where he earned a Ph.D. in international relations. Please join me in welcoming our\n"World Is Into Space" moderator,\nDr. Brian Dailey.\nDR. DAILEY: Thanks, Dave, for the introduction.\nAnd thanks to the U.S. Space Foundation for inviting\nme here.\nThis is the first time I\'ve ever had to moderate a\npanel. I\'m actually finding it quite easy. The only\nthing you have to learn how to say is, "It\'s 15 minutes\nor you\'re dead" to the speakers.\nWhat we have today is a very high-powered\npanel,\nand one that I think will provide us with some interesting insights into the key theme of the conference today\nwhich is, of course, Vision and Reality. This panel\nitself, though, is intended to deal with the reality of\nthe internationalization\nof space and to take a look at\nthe past vision that got us here today. And if possible,\nI hope, the speakers will try to prepare and propose a\nvision of where we want to be sometime tomorrow.\nOf special interest is a question of whether or not\nthe path to greater internationalization\nand participation in space will come through such means as the\ncivil space program, or from the apparent aggressive\nnature of what\'s taking place today in the international\ncommercial space marketplace--or\nobviously, a combination of both.\nIn the former case, the end of the Cold War has\nbrought together former foes and space giants on major international projects such as the International\nSpace Station. This offers the prospect of, among\nother things, greater pooling of resources to achieve\nbetter science and human exploration of space. Also,\nthe exchange of technology and methods to provide\nmaximum leverage of the best of each of the industrial\nbase that these countries can provide. And, of course,\nby working together, we hopefully promote a better\nand more stable peace.\nAlternatively, or in addition, an area given little\nnotice by many in the past visions of where we would\nbe today, is the role that commercial space will, and is\nplaying, in promoting greater international cooperation. Soon, space goods and services will have a larger\ndegree of international workshirt content, more than\nwhat you see today in just simple components, but\nmuch more in large scale subsystems.\nIt\'ll occur, as\n\nWORLD\n\nIS IlqTO SPACE\n\nwe\'re already starting to see, in space launch vehicles,\nsatellites and ground systems. It\'ll be something to the\npoint where the question of a national system will\nalmost be outmoded,\nat least in the civil and commercial areas. And of course the possibility strongly exists\nthat we may even see this extended into the military\nspace arena as well.\nIn short, as the title of the panel indicates, "The\nWorld Is Into Space," the discussions today will provide us with some very important insight into that\nparticular area which is becoming more and more\ninternational.\nWhat I\'d like to do is briefly introduce the panelists that we have up here. I\'ll start with Mr. Skip\nJohns who is the associate director of Technology\nat\nthe White House, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy; Dr. Ed Stone, the director of Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory;\nJean-Jacques\nDordain, associate director\nof International\nAffairs, Strategy and Planning, European Space Agency; John O\'Neill, director of Mission\nOperations,\nNASA Johnson Space Center; Chen\nBaosheng, chief executive officer, Great Wall of China\nIndustry Corporation;\nDr. Roland Dor6, president of\nInternational\nSpace University;\nand Mr. Lon Rains,\neditor of Space News.\nLet me begin by formally introducing\nMr. Johns,\nwith whom I used to work. He has worked previously\nup at the Office of Technology\nAssessment\nand Capitol\nHill. He has served there for approximately\n16 years\nand brings to the discussion quite an extensive background in technology and how technology applies to\nspace itself. Prior to joining OSTP, Mr. Johns served\n16 years in management\nof high technology\nindustries.\nHe gained them at the Ocean Science Incorporated,\nHazeltine Corporation,\nthe Magnavox Company,\nand\nGeneral Instruments\nCorporation.\nHe worked on projects involving design development and production of radars, communications,\nsonar, command and control systems. Immediately\nupon\nearning his bachelor of science degree from the University of Virginia, he served as an officer in the\nUnited States Navy, as a career-based\nnaval aviator.\nSkip, it\'s a pleasure.\nMR. JOHNS: Thank you. It\'s a pleasure to be back\nwith you this year. Last year, during my first symposium presentation,\nI\'m sure you thought that I was a\nlittle crazy. Just to refresh your memory, I was asked\nabout the Space Station and whether there was any\nchance it was going to pass the Congress. I indicated\nto you we were going to do everything\nlegally possible\nto make it pass. It took most of that, and a great deal\nof help on Dan Goldin\'s part, I might add. It passed\nby 117 votes. That\'s not one or two votes, that\'s 117\nvotes. So, sometimes a pearl of great price can be had\nif one works at it hard enough.\nI listened to Dan\'s vision this afternoon and enjoyed it very much. I don\'t know a lot about the fu-\n\n125\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nture. One has to be careful in forecasting;\nbut I heard\nOne thing that he said that I think I disagree with him\non. That is, I think bucks will be bytes, not pucks.\nSo\nthey\'re likely to be electronic rather than wood.\nI appreciate the opportunity\nto share some of the\nAdministration\'s\nviews on space with you today. In\nthe short time I have, let me start with the President\'s\nown words: "By advancing a program in robotic exploration using smaller, less costly spacecraft, we can\nfurther expand our understanding.\nBy renewing our\ncommitment to human space flight in concert with\nother nations, we can strengthen the bonds of international friendship\nwhile fostering the technological\ndevelopment\nthat holds the key to long term economic\ngrowth. By completing our Mission to Planet Earth,\nwe will gain unique insight into our planet\'s dynamic\nenvironment.\nWe have one chance to keep our covenant with the generations\nto come, safeguarding\nthe\nthin blue shield that sustains all of Earth\'s inhabitants."\n\n"By renewing\n\nour commitment\n\nspace flight in concert\ncan strengthen\nfriendship\n\nwith other nations,\n\neconomic\n\nwe\n\nthe bonds of international\n\nwhile fostering\n\ndevelopment\n\nto human\n\nthe technological\n\nthat holds the key to long-term\ngrowth."--President\n\nsive, more frequent missions with shorter development\ntimes. By fiscal year \'99, this new approach to space\nexploration will allow NASA to reduce average development costs of space science and Mission to Planet\nEarth payloads from $590 million in fiscal year \'90\'94 to $200 million, cut average development\ntime\nfrom eight years to four years, and increase yearly\nlaunches to an average of eight missions instead of two\nper year. This means expanding opportunities\nfor the\nU.S. and the international\nscience community with\nmore frequent missions and shorter lead times to orbit.\nFourth, this Administration\nhas laid the groundwork for focused investments\nin space transportation.\nIn 1994 we issued a policy designed to enable low-cost\naccess to space. This policy provides a framework\nfor\nNASA and DoD investments in next generation reusable launch systems and modernization\nof current ELV\nfleet.\nLast month the Administration\nannounced a cooperative agreement with three industry teams to begin\npreliminary\ndesign work on a next generation launch\nsystem which might eventually replace the space shutfie. The program will focus on development\nof new\ntechnologies\nand operational techniques which will\nradically reduce the cost of access to space. Again, in\nan international\nsense, increasing affordable access to\nspace is something that stands to benefit all of our\nnations involved in space activities.\n\nClinton\nThe Administration\n\nThe President made these remarks on the occasion\nof the 25th anniversary of Apollo 11. There\'s an awful\nlot there that goes beyond just Apollo and is relevant\nfor those of us dedicated to this nation\'s future in\nspace. Let me just highlight what I\'d call the main\nprinciples and programs underlying the Administration\'s space policy.\nFirst, we view the space program as a fundamental, long-term investment in America\'s\nfuture. President Clinton believes that a balanced, affordable space\nprogram based on revolutionary\nnew partnerships\nwith\nthe private sector and with other space-faring\nnations\nis a critical investment in America\'s 21st century economy.\nSecond, we\'re dedicated to preserving American\nleadership in space. The Clinton Administration\nsupports Dan Goldin in remaking America\'s\nspace agency\nto ensure continuing U.S. world leadership in science\nand technology.\nNASA has implemented\npersonnel\nreductions, major management\nchanges to cut costs,\nreduce bureaucracy\nand improve performance.\nThird, we are revolutionizing\nthe way we conduct\nspace missions, pursuing "faster, better, cheaper"\nscience missions. President Clinton supports NASA\'s\nrevolutionizing\nAmerican space exploration\nby replacing large complex spacecraft with smaller, less expen-\n\n126\n\nin supporting\ninternational\norbiting\n\nhas been at the forefront\nthe development\n\nof the\n\nSpace Station as a world-class\nlaboratory\n\nunprecedented\n\nand a catalyst\n\npeaceful\n\ncooperation\n\nfor\n\ninternational\n\nin space.\n\nFifth and perhaps most relevant to this panel\'s\ndiscussion,\nwe are committed to building the international Space Station. The Administration\nhas been at\nthe forefront in supporting the development\nof the\ninternational\nSpace Station as a world-class\norbiting\nlaboratory and a catalyst for unprecedented\npeaceful\ninternational\ncooperation\nin space. On more than a few\noccasions, both the President and Vice President Gore\nhave personally engaged on this issue.\nIn 1993 the Administration\nrestructured\nthe management of the program, capped its annual budget at\n$2.1 billion. Since the restructuring,\nthe program has\nmet all costs, technical and schedule requirements,\nand\n37,000 pounds of hardware have been manufactured.\nTwelve thousand pounds ahead of schedule. In my\nview, that\'s a pretty impressive record for such a\ncomplex international\nprogram.\n\nTHE\n\nWhen complete, the international\nSpace Station\nwill be a world-class\norbiting laboratory providing a\ntest bed for technologies\nof the future and a laboratory\nfor research on new, advanced industrial materials,\ncommunications\ntechnology and medical research. It\nwill also be an historic symbol of the benefits of\npeaceful cooperation\nin space. Following the Administration\'s lead, the Space Station partners have included Russia in the program, making the station a\npotent tool for fostering productive\ncooperation\namong\nformer adversaries\nand for promoting world peace.\nAnd sixth, we remain committed to the important\nexploration of our own planet Earth. One of NASA\'s\nmost important research programs is the exploration of\nour own planet. NASA\'s Mission to Planet Earth is\nusing satellite technologies\nto monitor the Earth\'s\nenvironment\nand better understand the world in which\nwe live. This program is giving us powerful new tools\nfor analyzing weather, for long-term prediction of\nfloods, drought, violent storms and other natural occurrences. It is also giving us fundamental\nnew insights into how human activities may also have profound effects on our planet.\nIn an era of increasingly\nconstrained budgets, not\njust in the U.S. but also in other countries, international cooperation\ncan and will play an increasingly\nimportant role. At the same time, space technologies\nand applications\nwill increasingly become part of a\nbroader, more competitive\nglobal economy. We have\nseen this evolve in the satellite communication\narena\nand my presumption\nis that other applications\nof space\ntechnology will follow suit.\nOur goal at the national level will be to make\nevery federal dollar count to ensure that the right\npolicy environment\nto encourage civil, commercial\nand\nnational security use of space remains high on the\nnational agenda.\nThank you very much.\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you, Skip. The next speaker is\nDr. Ed Stone, who as I said is the director of Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nDr. Stone is also vice president\nand professor of physics at California Institute of\nTechnology,\nCal Tech. He earned his associates of arts\ndegree in 1956 from Burlington Junior College before\ncontinuing his studies at the University of Chicago.\nAfter receiving his masters of science and Ph.D. degrees in physics, he joined Cal Tech as a research\nfellow in physics. Dr. Stone was appointed chairman\nof Cal Tech\'s Division of Mathematics\nand Astronomy\nin 1983 and vice president of the astronautical\nfacilities\nin 1988.\nSince 1961, Dr. Stone has been the principal investigator on nine NASA spacecraft missions and a coinvestigator\non five other NASA missions. Dr. Stone\nhas served has project scientist for the Voyager missions of 1972, participating\nin both hardware development and mission operations.\nFollowing the launch in\n\nFigure\n\nWORLD\n\nIS INTO SPACE\n\nWS-1\n\n1977 of twin Voyager spacecraft, he coordinated\nthe\nefforts of 11 teams of scientists in their studies of\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and I think he\'ll\nbe able to tell us what the future will hold for us.\nSTONE:\nThank you, Brian. It\'s certainly my\npleasure to be here today. This is a very important\ntime for the space program in the nation and, in fact,\nin the world. And meetings such as this, I think, are\nreally crucial to helping us all understand\nwhat the\nfuture should be because space is clearly about the\nfuture. In the first three decades of the planetary\nprogram (Fig. WS-1), we have flown by every planet in\nthe solar system except Pluto, including Mercury,\nVenus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. We have defined the frontier in the first 30-35\nyears of the space age. Rather than worlds of uninteresting similarity, we discovered\nworlds of intriguing\ndiversity that beckon our return. Now that we have\ndefined the frontier, we need to open it while emphasizing several critical aspects of the space exploration\nprogram.\nThe first aspect is broader participation\nso we can\nfocus the best talent in the nation and the world on\nopening the space frontier. Broader participation\nmeans growing participation\nand partnerships\nwith\nindustry, other government\nactivities, and academia, as\nwell as increasing international\ncollaboration.\nA second aspect that will enable broader participation is an increasing frequency of smaller missions\nwith decreasing\nlife cycle costs. I want to illustrate\nthese two characteristics,\nbroader participation\nand\nmore frequent smaller missions, for the years ahead.\nOur next major encounter is with Jupiter employing the Galileo spacecraft (Fig. WS-2), which arrives\nthis December.\nThis international\nmission uses a German engine to slow down and insert the spacecraft into\nDR.\n\n127\n\n11TH NATIONAL SPACE SYMPOSIUM\n\nFigure\n\nW$-2\n\nFigure\n\nWS-3\n\norbit. Galileo carries a probe developed by Hughes for\nNASA/Ames\nthat will plunge into the atmosphere\nof\nJupiter, providing the first insitu measurement\nof the\ncomposition of the atmosphere,\ntemperature,\npressure\nand cloud layers of the planet. The spacecraft will\ncarry out a two-year orbital tour of the Jovian system,\nflying much closer to the moons of Jupiter than Voyager did in 1979.\nOne of those moons, Europa (Fig. WS-3), is about\nthe size of our own moon but has an icy crust. Europa\nis of interest because it has the smoothest surface\nwe\'ve found in the solar system. The highest features\non this surface are the narrow white streaks that are\napproximately\n200 meters high. It\'s possible that this\nis an ice pack on an ocean of liquid water. Galileo will\nreturn data from this moon with a resolution that is\n100 to 1,000 times better than the very best Voyager\ndata. If this is, indeed, a world with an ocean on it, I\ncan\'t imagine that we won\'t return to explore it in\ngreat detail because of the important role of oceans in\n\n128\n\nWS-4\n\nFigure\n\nFigure\n\nWS-5\n\nthe origins of life here on Earth.\nFurther out in the solar system is another giant\nplanet, Saturn (Fig. WS-4), that will be explored by the\nCassini Mission to be launched in 1997. Cassini is a\njoint NASA/ESA\nundertaking,\nwith approximately\n134\nU.S. scientists and 120 European scientists participating in the mission. In addition, the Italian Space Agency is separately providing the large dish antenna and\nthe radio system, critical to telecommunications,\nring\noccultation studies, and radar mapping of Saturn\'s\nmoon, Titan.\nThe Huggens probe (Fig. WS-5), provided by ESA,\nwill be dropped into the atmosphere\nof Titan, a moon\nthe size of the planet Mercury. Titan\'s atmosphere,\nmainly nitrogen with a surface pressure 60% higher\nthan on Earth, contains methane that solar and particle\nirradiation continuously\nconverts into complex organic\nmolecules. This process may be similar to what occurred on Earth before life evolved. Cassini\'s Huggens\nprobe will drop into the atmosphere\nand provide the\nfirst insitu measurement\nof the organic chemistry occurring there. We are anxious to determine whether\nthe organic material raining out of the atmosphere\nmay\nbe forming lakes of organic material on the surface. I\n\nTHE WORLD IS INTO SPACE\n\nFigure\n\nFigure\n\nWS-6\n\nWS-7\n\nanticipate that we will return to the surface of Titan\nfor further studies of this intriguing world.\nA little closer to home is Mars (Fig. WS-6), a\nneighboring\nplanet that we believe at one time had a\ngreat deal of water on its surface. A Mars\' image\n(Fig. WS-7) shows an old river bed indicating that\nperhaps 3 1/2 billion years ago there was a large\namount of water on the surface. If so, simple life\ncould have evolved and there may well be some fossil\nevidence of primitive life forms somewhere on Mars.\nThe small oval in the image is one of the landing\nsites we\'re considering\nfor the Mars Pathfinder lander,\nto be launched late in \'96. This site is a flood plain\ncontaining rocks washed down from widely spread\nregions. The material will be examined by a small\nmicrorover\n(Fig. WS-8), that is being carried to the\nsurface by Mars Pathfinder. The rover is a miniature\nspacecraft with a mass of 11.5 kilograms.\nUsing an\naverage power of only 8 watts provided by solar cells,\n\nFigure\n\nFigure\n\nWS-8\n\nWS-9\n\nit will maneuver on the surface, using a German-developed camera and an alpha-proton\nx-ray spectrometer to analyze the composition of the rocks. The main\nPathfinder lander will have stereo cameras and a\nweather station.\nMars Pathfinder will be accompanied\nby a second Mars mission, the Mars Global Surveyor\n(Fig. WS-9), which will use aerobraking\nto circularize\nits polar orbit. The Global Surveyor will return maps\nof the surface of Mars - with resolution of two meters\n- so we can begin to explore the surface and look for\nthe sites for future robotic surface exploration missions\nleading eventually to human exploration.\nThe spacecraft is being built by Lockheed Martin and will be\nlaunched on a Delta launch vehicle. It is about half the\nmass of the Mars Observer spacecraft, which was\nunfortunately\nlost several years ago.\nThe Mars \'98 Orbiter (Fig. WS-IO), with a mass of\n250 kilograms,\nis another factor of two smaller in\nmass than Mars Global Surveyor. Both the "98 Orbiter\n\n129\n\n11TH\n\nI\n\nFigure\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\n_\n\nz_.._!" _mi,._"m-_\n\n---\n\nFigure\n\nWS-IO\n\nJIlL\n\nRosetta\n\nChampolhon\n\nWS-12\n\nI Champolllon\n\nLander\nIII.B.I-I\n\nFigure\n\nWS-11\n\nand Lander will be built by Lockheed Martin and\nlaunched on MedLight launch vehicles. Smaller spacecraft that can be launched with much smaller vehicles\nwill allow us to explore Mars every two years rather\nthan every two decades. That\'s the "better" of "faster,\nbetter, cheaper."\nThe \'96 mission includes a French-developed\nradio\nreceiver which will act as a relay for the planned\nRussian \'96 mission, providing an important international connection. With more frequent missions to\nMars, there will be multiple opportunities\nfor increased scientific return through international\ncollaborations.\nThe Champollion\nLander (Fig. WS-11 ) will be\ncarried by the ESA Rosetta spacecraft on a comet\nrendezvous and sample analysis mission. Champollion\nis a joint NASA-CNES\ndevelopment\nwith a tiny 42\nkilogram landed package with spikes to hold it in place\nas it drills into the surface. The sampling depth will\nreach as much as 100 centimeters\nso that we can analyze the composition of the organic material that coats\nthe surface of the comets in the solar system. These\nobservations\nare critical to studies of the origin of the\nsolar system and of the possible role comets may have\n\n130\n\nFigure\n\nTile\n\nS_aceProbe\n\n(?ore\n\nBus/or\n\ntile\n\nSTARDUST\n\nMission\n\nWS-13\n\nhad in the evolution of life here on Earth.\nFigure WS-12 shows another approach to expanding participation\nin planetary exploration through missions headed by principal investigators.\nAllen Binder\nof Lockheed Martin heads the team that will send a\nsmall spacecraft (126 kg) to the moon. Following the\nvery successful Clementine\nmission, Lunar Prospector\nwill carry gamma ray, neutron and alpha particle instruments to map the surface. This mission is the next\nDiscovery Mission after Mars Pathfinder and the Near\nEarth Asteroid Rendezvous\nspacecraft being built by\nthe Applied Physics Laboratory\nand scheduled for\nlaunch in February "96.\nThree other Discovery missions are in Phase A\nstudy; one will be selected. The principal investigators\nput together the teams with JPL in a supporting role to\nhelp implement the mission.\nStardust (Fig. WS-13) is a sample return mission\nwith Don Brownlee at the University of Washington\nas\nthe Principal Investigator.\nThe small yellow container\non top will open and out will pop aerogels developed\nby JPL that will collect comet dust in one case, and\ninterplanetary\ndust in another. This dust may well be\nthe source of organic material in the solar system and\n\nTHE\n\nFigure\n\nWS-14\n\nthese samples will be returned to Earth for detailed\nanalysis.\nAnother sample return mission (Fig. WS-14),\nSuess-Urey,\nhas Don Burner of Caltech as the Principal Investigator.\nLike Stardust, the Suess-Urey team\nincludes Lockheed Martin. The large circular panels\non the spacecraft are disks of pure silicon that will\ncapture the solar wind and bring it back to Earth for a\nprecise determination\nof the composition of the Sun.\nFinally, the Venus Muitiprobe\nMission (Fig. WS15) has Richard Goody at Harvard as Team Leader.\nHughes is responsible\nfor developing the system to put\n16 probes (25 kilograms each) into the atmosphere of\nVenus. These are tiny, but capable probes which will\nbe tracked by Very Long Baseline Interferometry\nfrom\nEarth so we can study the cause of the unusual winds\non this planet.\nFigure WS-16 shows the masses of these and other\nmissions as a function of launch date. Clementine set\nthe stage for the trend toward smaller, more capable\nmissions. The missions which I have described are all\nin the several hundred kilogram class. We are now in\nthe process of developing the road map for the next\nstep--to go below 100 kilogram missions-the New\nMillennium class of spacecraft.\nWe had a workshop at JPL (Fig. WS-17) in March\nattended by representatives\nfrom various groups to\nhelp us define the key technologies\nthat will enable us\nto reduce the mission life cycle costs so that more\nfrequent are more affordable. Industry, university,\nand\nother federal laboratory members will be selected to\nparticipate in each of the five integrated product development teams. Our goals are to develop the technology\nwhich will be the key to the next step toward smaller,\nmore frequent missions.\nNASA\'s focus is on expanding the frontiers of\nspace, taking advantage of the nation\'s capabilities as a\nspacefaring society and working with international\ncollaborators\nto do what hasn\'t been done before.\n\nFigure\n\nWORLD\n\nIS INTO SPACE\n\nWS-15\n\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you. Dr. Stone, what do you see\nas the role of manned space exploration versus i\'obotic\nexploration?\nDR. STONE: I think they really serve complementary\npurposes. Human exploration\nis something which\ninvolves human beings going there, and ultimately,\nthere\'s really no substitute for that, but there\'s a great\ndeal that can be done with robotic exploration.\nConcerning Mars, for instance, it is clear that robotic\nexploration is very important for setting the stage,\nbecause human exploration will be much more complex. We need to be sure that when we send humans\nto Mars, we take best advantage of their capability to\nexplore the most interesting regions. To do this we\nneed to understand Mars a great deal better than we do\ntoday robotically before we would want to send the\nvery precious resource of human explorers.\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you, Ed, for a great preview of\nwhat new science missions we have coming up, and\nwe look forward to the data which it will provide.\nOur next speaker is our first component of the\ninternational\nportion of this panel. I have the great\npleasure of introducing,\nJean-Jacques\nDordain. He is\nthe associate director for Strategy Planning and International Policy at the European Space Agency in\nParis, France. Prior to that he was a research engineer\nfrom 1970-1985 at the Office of the International\nInstitute of Aerospace Research in France. He was\nalso manager from 1986 at the European Space\nAgency, first as the director of Space Station Utilization and Microgravity\nPrograms and then as director of Strategy.\nHe is a member of the International\nAcademy of\nAeronautics\nand a member of the European Science\nand Technology\nAssembly. Welcome.\nMR. DORDAIN: Thank you very much. I am pleased\nand honored to be with you today, and I am ready to\nshare my views about space activities with you.

I have\nstill more questions than I have answers to questions.\nAs a primary remark, I wish to say that after a\ncouple of years of being in charge of strategy in ESA I\nhave arrived at the conclusion that we, the space agencies, should refrain to propose an overall space policy\nfor at least two reasons.\nFirst, because space is not an objective per se, just\na place to run different objectives.\nCultural objectives\nsuch as improving our knowledge or exploring our\nuniverse, strategic objectives such as monitoring disarmament or making foreign policy, and economic objectives, meaning making money.\nThere is not, therefore, one space policy, but a lot\nof different policies involved in space utilization:\npolicy of science, policy of telecommunications,\npolicy\nof environment,\netc. The only common points among\nthese policies are the means of access to space and\nsome space technologies.\nThe second reason why we should refrain to define\none space policy is because there is always some suspicion when a space agency proposes a vision. Suspicion that the only objective of such a policy would be\nto survive.\nI shall not propose a global space policy today.\nAnd I shall limit my presentation\nto address some of\nthe key aspects which I believe drive the near future of\nthese activities.\nI shall start by the general aspects of the transition\nperiod we are all living today. These general aspects\nare important to understand\nthe programmatic\naspects\nthat I shall address in the second part of my presentation.\nWe are leaving the transition period which mostly\nrepresents a sign of maturity. Even though this transition has been disturbed by the political change and the\neconomical difficulties,\nthis transition is a natural\nprocess after 30 years of space age, after 30 years of\nsuccesses. This transition is just a mark of our past\nsuccesses. We must not, therefore,\nregret it, we have\njust to manage it. This transition period ends the first\n\n132\n\nFigure\n\nWS-17\n\nage of space activities. In the first age of space activities we were dedicated to first develop means of access\nto space. And I would like to recall that thirty to\nthirty-five percent of the space budgets in almost all\nspace agencies were dedicated so far to access to\nspace; second, to demonstrate\nthe social and economic\nbenefits of space applications;\nand third, to build up an\nindustrial and technological\nbase.\nThe second characteristic\nof the first space age was\nthat the organization\nwas very simple. There were the\nspace agencies distributing money to industry under\ntheir control and for the benefit of dedicated and specific users.\nThe third characteristic\nof the first space age is\nthat we were accustomed to budget regular growth.\nThis transition period opens the second age of\nspace activities, and the second age of space activities\nwill be characterized\nfirst, by the fact that expertise is\nnow mostly with industry. The mature applications\nof\nspace are driven by the market and are more and more\nintegrated in the regular industrial, economic, and\nsocial world. They benefit each individual and are not\nonly to specific users any more.\nThe second characteristic\nis that the actors are\nmore and more numerous. There are many more actors than just space agencies and industry. And the\norganization\nbecomes more and more complex. Industry has more and more different customers.\nThe third characteristic\nis that the public budget\nwill stay, at best, constant in the foreseeable future.\nThe two main consequences\nof this constant public\nbudget are: first, the increase in the development\nof\nspace activities will rely upon the development\nof\nprivate investments.\nPrivate investments require a\nfeeling of stability. The horizon must be clear and\nclean and the rules of the game must be well defined.\nIt\'s our duty to manage this transition period as quickly as possible in order to show a clear and clean reference picture to potential investors.\nThe second consequence\nis that to start new activities and face new challenges within the constant budget\n\nTHE\n\nof space agencies, it is necessary to transfer activities\nfrom these agencies to other organizations,\nespecially\nthe operational\nand routine activities. This transfer is\nalready well advanced in Europe where Arianespace\nis\noperating the Ariane Launch Vehicle. EUMETSAT\nis\noperating the meteorology\nsatellites. This transfer will\nbe reinforced\nin the future.\nThe role of space agencies will be, therefore, in\nthe future more and more focused towards science;\nscience of the Universe and science of the Earth, science being also a factor of competitivity.\nSecond,\nfocused on access to space with the dramatic reduction\nof efforts dedicated to strategic aspects, but with an\nimportant effort dedicated to technologies\nable to reduce the launch cost. And third, and not the least,\nfocused on exploration--and\nI think that Mr. Goldin\ngave a very interesting presentation\nof what could be\nthe exploration\nin the 21st century.\n\nThere is not, therefore,\na lot of different\nutilization:\n\none space policy, but\n\npolicies\n\ninvolved\n\npolicy of science,\n\ntelecommunications,\n\nin space\n\npolicy of\n\npolicy of environment,\n\netc. The only common\npolicies are the means\n\npoints among these\nof access to space\n\nand some space technologies.\n\nAs for the applications,\nthe role of space agencies\ncan be limited to the promotion of emerging applications such as the utilization of microgravity.\nFor the\napplications\nwhich are already identified for their\nsocial and economic benefits, the basic scheme should\nbe a direct link between customers and suppliers.\nGovernments\nare the worst partners for market-driven\napplications,\nespecially because of the time necessary\nto make public budgets available. In addition, only\ninvestors can really make the cost decrease, not engineers.\nSpace agencies must, therefore, stay on the second\nrow for these mature applications,\ntheir major role\nbeing to accelerate the transition toward the second\nage of space activities.\nThe last general aspect I would like to address is a\ntrend towards an increased globalization\nof space activities. Any space nation cannot define now its future\nactivities without analyzing and taking into account the\ninternational\ncontext. The international\ncontext has\nalways been an important factor for space activities, be\nit for competition or for cooperation.\nBut the recent\npolitical changes have opened new opportunities\nof\ncooperation\nand also have brought new competitors.\nThis new international\npicture has generated instabilities, in particular in Europe, which is the only way to\n\nWORLD\n\nIS INTO\n\nSPACE\n\npass from one equilibrium\nto another equilibrium.\nIn\nEurope, the balance between European autonomy and\ncooperation\nmostly with the United States, which was\nthe basis of the 80s has to be revised now in order to\nbe adjusted to the new world.\nThe most significant consequence of such a revision concerns the large infrastructure\nprograms,\nnamely the Ariane5 Launch Vehicle and the Space Station.\nAs for Ariane, Europe has to face new competitors\nwhich reinforces the need to complete the development\nof Ariane5 as soon as possible. The first launch is\nscheduled now next November,\nmeaning less than six\nmonths of delay compared to the initial plan defined\n10 years ago.\nAs for the Space Station, and more generally,\nmanned space flight, Europe has definitely abandoned\nthe autonomous\npart of its initial plan. The Columbus\nFreeflying Laboratory, then Hermes, then finally the\nCrew Transport Vehicle have disappeared\nfrom our\nplans. Europe has kept its participation\nto the International Space Station. This was not so simple to get rid\nof the autonomous part of the main infrastructure\nand\nto refocus all European efforts toward the international\ncollaboration\npart, even if this decision was the obvious move to do in view of the new international\ncontext.\nThe integration of Russia among the Space Station\npartners has made the International\nSpace Station a\nunique enterprise. Unique because it is the first worldwide pacific enterprise.\nUnique because this is the\nright place to test new technologies,\nlong-term maintenance, complex operations,\nlong duration manned\nflights in view of future international\nexploration programs. Unique because of the resources the station\noffered to scientific users: tens of kilowatts, tens of\ncubic meters, tens of square meters, at least ten times\nwhat can offer a regular satellite, resources which are\nassociated to regular visits, repairs, and reconfigurations.\n\nAny space nation cannot define now its\nfuture activities\ninto account\n\nwithout\n\nanalyzing\n\nthe international\n\nand taking\ncontext.\n\nSo Europe cannot be out of the international\nspace\nstation. Two weeks ago the member states of ESA\nreaffirmed their determination\nto participate,\nand they\nconfirmed the basis of their participation:\nthe provision\nof a laboratory attached to the Space Station and the\nprovision of logistic services during the exploitation\nphase in order to offset their share of the Station\'s\ncommon operation costs.\nAs you can see, this participation\nis exactly what\nEurope has been committed to provide since its initial\n\n133\n\n11TH NATIONAL\n\nFigure\n\nWS-19\n\nFigure\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nWS-18\n\nFigure\n\nSPACE\n\nWS-20\n\nengagement.\nThe only and important decision which\nstill remains to be taken is a multiyear budget commitment which will be decided next October by the 14\nministers representing\nthe member states of ESA.\nThere are still some difficulties to overcome before\nsuch a multiyear budget can be committed,\nespecially\nwhen this commitment\nmust cover not only the devel-\n\n134\n\nopment phase but also the exploitation phase, meaning\nalmost a 20-year commitment.\nIt\'s not so easy with 14\nmember states, and in the middle of a transition period. But the longstanding\ncollaboration\namong the\nESA member states has shown in the past that such\ndifficulties can be overcome, especially in the frame of\na broader package deal.\nAs a matter of fact, the budget decision on the\nEuropean participation\nto the International\nSpace Station is not the only one on the agenda of ministers\nnext October. Three major programmatic\ndecisions\nmust be taken by ministers: the European participation\nto the station, the Ariane5 complementary\nprograms\nincluding the evolution of the Ariane5 performance,\nand the scientific program for the next five years.\nThese three major programs constitute a reasonable\nand balanced package where all member states can\nfind their interest. The final decision will be a global\ndecision on the overall package.\nI shall conclude my presentation\nby recalling that\nthe difficulties we are facing are just a result of our\nsuccesses. In spite of these difficulties,\nspace activities\nare not just discussions\nand paperwork.\nMajor achievements will take place in \'95 in ESA with six major\nmissions, starting two weeks from now with the launch\nof the ERS-2 satellite. ERS-2 is a radar satellite which\nwill be operated in tandem with its predecessor\nERS-1\nto bring stereoscopic\nradar pictures. After ERS-2, the\nnext major mission will be the launch of an astronaut,\nThomas Reiter, to the MIR station for a long duration\nflight of 135 days during which Thomas Reiter will\nperform extravehicular\nactivities and participate to the\nmaintenance\nof the MIR station. This mission is a\nconcrete sign of the European will to participate to the\nstation.\nOctober-November\nwill be a very busy period with\nthe launch of three major scientific missions. The first\none, ISO, is an infrared telescope launched by Ariane.\nThe second one is SOHO, a solar observatory,\nlaunched by a U.S. Atlas vehicle. The last one is\nCluster, consisting of four satellites dedicated to the\nstudy of the magnetosphere.\nThe Cluster mission will\nbe launched by the first Ariane5. The first flight of the\nAriane5 is the first of the two qualification\nflights after\nwhich the operations will be transferred\nto\nArianespace.\nAs you can see, 1995 is a great vintage\nfor ESA, full of missions and full of decisions.\nThank you very much.\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you, Mr. Dordain, for the very\nimportant and useful insight into the European perspective. Another perspective comes from our next\nspeaker, who has really been part of the past vision\nand most certainly was one of the people who brought\nreality to the past vision. We look forward to hearing\nhis insights today with respect to how he sees the\nfuture. I\'m speaking of John O\'Neill, the director of\nthe Johnson Space Center, Missions Operations Direc-\n\nTHE\n\ntorate, which provides the pre-flight planning, training, and real-time flight control for NASA human\nspace flight operations and for supporting transportation elements. He has had a management role in\nall major areas of JSC responsibilities\nfrom providing\nflight control teams and operation support to the disciplines of spacecraft systems, trajectory design, mission\nplanning, and reconfiguration\nof flight software.\nMr. O\'Neill\'s\n30 years with NASA includes space\nsystems operations\nand procedures,\ndevelopment\nfor\nthe Gemini program and management\nof the flight\nplanning, and on-board data processes of Apollo and\nSkylab programs.\nPlease join me in welcoming Mr.\nO\'Neill.\nMR.O\'NEILL:\nThank you. It\'s really a pleasure to be\nhere today, and it\'s particularly\nan honor to share the\npodium with such a distinguished\nand visionary group.\nYes, I have been part of past programs in NASA,\nbut we would like to think in the operations world that\nwe must be an enabling part, a very enabling part, of\nthe vision for the future which you heard articulated\nhere today. The theme, yes, has been reality to vision.\nYou could view what I will discuss as more toward the\nreality end. I would really ask you to share with me\nwhat are more along the lines of ideas as to how to\nenable the future. In particular, we need the participation of industry and new ways to work on that future.\nNew Partnerships\n\nin Space Operations\n\n(Summary)\n\nThe emerging era of international\ncooperation\nin\nspace exploration\nand exploitation\nmust face the constraints of limited resources.\nThe initiation and development of projects that represent the future require\nthat the operations\nexpenditures\nof ongoing and new\nprograms be reduced from present levels. Government\nand commercial\npartnerships\nin a new operations paradigm may provide lowered costs for programs and\nnew opportunities\nfor industry.\nThe Future in Space Operations - (Fig. WS-18)\nThe utilization and exploitation of near-Earth space\nwill continue. The spacefaring\nnations of the world\nwill press beyond low Earth orbit to explore our solar\nsystem and beyond. This will require partnerships\non\nan international\nscale never before achieved in order to\nset the scientific goals, surmount the technical problems, and share the financial burden. The cost will be\nhigh on an absolute scale, but well worth the investment in the more relevant measure of the contribution\nto the future of our world.\nA major challenge in the operations community is\nto fit the price of space endeavors into the agendas and\nthe budgets of participating\nnations. Fortunately,\nthe\noperations\ncommunity\nis an international\ncommunity\nthat knows few boundaries\nand shares lessons learned,\nideas, and plans as we work for the future. The opera-\n\ntions function\n\nwill continue\n\nWORLD\n\nIS INTO\n\nto be critical--critical\n\nSPACE\n\nto\n\nthe current engineering\nprocess of designing and developing better and more autonomous robotic and\nhuman spacecraft and critical to meeting mission objectives and dealing with the unforeseen.\nBudget Challenges - (Fig. WS-19)\nPrograms must operate within tightly constrained\nbudgets and provide for more return on resources\ninvested. This clearly means that available resources\nmust be concentrated on the objectives in space and\nthe science and technology and not on Earthbound\ninfrastructure.\nThe budget must emphasize flight hardware and software. Operations\nand the overall approach to risk management\nmust meet the requirements\nof safe and successful missions, but this must be\nachieved within a cost structure that does not impede\nnew starts.\n\nTwo weeks ago the member\nreaffirmed\n\nstates of ESA\n\ntheir determination\n\nand they confirmed\nparticipation:\nattached\nprovision\nexploitation\n\nto participate,\n\nthe basis of their\n\nthe provision\n\nof a laboratory\n\nto the Space Station and the\nof logistic services\n\nduring the\n\nphase in order to offset their\n\nshare of the Station\'s\n\ncommon\n\noperation\n\ncosts.\n\nA Definition of Operations - (Fig. WS-20)\nBecause the concept to be discussed was developed\nfrom the perspective of flight operations,\na definition\nis presented.\nMission operations\nis the process of\nplanning, rehearsing,\nand conducting the flight phase\nof a spacecraft to attain program objectives. This definition is also pertinent to this discussion because the\nscope of flight operations varies a great deal from one\nspace organization\nto another, making comparisons\ndifficult.\nThe Resource Allocations\nin JSC Mission Operations (Fig. WS-21)\nUsing this definition for flight operations,\nthe\npresent resource allocation within the Mission Operations Directorate\nat the NASA Johnson Space Center is\nuseful in making a point. The point is that approximately 70 percent of the resources go to the development of operations support facilities and systems and\ntheir maintenance\nand sustaining engineering.\nGreat strides have been made in reducing the cost\nof facilities through such logical steps as the use of\ncommercial\noff-the-shelf\nhardware and software and\n\n135\n\n11 TH NATIONAL SPACE SYMPOSIUM\n\nFlight operations cost reduction and process improvement initiatives have been and continue to be\nproductive,\nbut are beginning to show diminishing\nreturns within the existing general framework\nof\nNASA and contractor relationships\nand ways of doing\nbusiness. New paradigms\nmust be examined and new\npartnerships\nexplored in order to achieve the needed\nsavings.\nRestructuring\n\nFigure\n\nWS-22\n\nFigure\n\nWS-23\n\nincreased reliance on the maintenance\nservices of the\nequipment suppliers. Despite these initiatives, the cost\nof ownership\nof the required facilities remains high.\nFurther streamlining\nis also needed in actual flight\npreparation,\ntraining, and flight control processes.\nMission\n\n136\n\nOperations\n\n- (Fig. WS-23)\n\nThe principles guiding the studies of how flight\noperations might be restructured\ninclude the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Maintain NASA\'s bottomline accountability\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Maintain stable operations\nprocesses on ongoing\nprograms.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Transfer stable operations\nprocesses to industry\nat the earliest practical\nopportunity.\nPlace the NASA\nemphasis on the critical operations\ncontrol functions\nand leading edge research and development\nwhich\ncontributes to more effective and autonomous operations.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Phase commercially\nviable operations support\nfacilities and functions to the private sector.\n\nWS-21\n\nFigure\n\nGuidelines\n\nRestructuring\n\n- (Fig. WS-22)\n\nThe New Model for Mission Operations - (Fig. WS-24)\nIn this proposed new model for mission operations, functions have been transferred\nto the contractor\nand to the commercial\nsector on two levels. In keeping\nwith the bottom line accountability\nthat will continue\nto be a government\nresponsibility\non NASA programs,\nthe agency will set the program objectives and define\nthe mission requirements\nthat carry out those objectives. NASA responsibility\nwould continue through the\nmission execution phase, where the mission director\nand flight director working with a small team would\nmanage the real-time activities and support. The powerful automated capabilities and expert systems now\navailable, and rapidly improving, plus increasing\nspacecraft autonomy should facilitate the flight control\ntask and reduce the staffing required.\nThis model then modifies the way we work with\nthe contractors during the flight preparation\nand training phase. The processes are changed from intermingled government\nand contractor tasks to objective\ncontracting where the specific flight operations products and services necessary to execute the mission are\nclearly defined and have deadlines matched and measured against overall program schedules. This will\nreduce the government\ninvolvement and increase the\naccountability\nof the NASA contractors.\nIt will also\nallow the contractors\nmore freedom and incentives to\nstreamline and reduce cost. A small NASA presence\nwill be maintained in each major contractor discipline\nto interpret and coordinate requirements\nand schedules.\nA more radical shift to industry responsibility\nis\nthe third element of the model. It is proposed that\ncommercialization\nof portions of the NASA operations\n\nTHE\n\ninfrastructure\noffers the potential of significantly\nreducing the demands on the NASA budget while providing opportunity,\nnot just cost reduction challenges,\nto industry. In this concept, commercially\nviable elements of NASA\'s command, control, and data services\ninfrastructure\nwould be packaged and offered for commercialization\non a competitive basis. This proposal,\nwhich requires much additional evaluation, is based on\nthe premise that NASA has developed many capabilities that could serve a wide range of other customers\nin the government,\nacademia, industry, and international sectors. If these capabilities were commercialized, the operator could serve NASA programs on an\nanchor tenant basis but the operator would be free,\nand encouraged,\nto provide services commercially\nto\nother customers.\nRecent facility developments\nsuch as the new Mission Control Center in Houston have provided extremely flexible capabilities which could serve a variety of customers with only modest augmentation.\nThe\nservices can be provided remotely at the customer\'s\nlocation. The end result could be significantly reduced\nNASA cost; business expansion potential for the commercial operator; and a cost-effective\nmeans of avoiding unnecessary\ncommand, control, and data services\ninvestment.\nThe funding can be concentrated\non the\ninvestment in space.\n\nFigure\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\n1950s:\n\nOF\n\nCHINA\n\nBEGAN\n\n(WtlEN\n\nintermingled\n\ngovernment\n\ntasks to objective\nspecific\nservices\n\nflight\n\nADVANCEI)\n\ncontracting\n\nprogram\n\nSCIENCE\n\n--\n\nTO\n\n--\n\nPEACFFUL\n\n--\n\nTO\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nPOWER\n\nAND\n\nTECHNOLOGY)\n\nEXPLOIT\n\nTItE\n\nSPACE\n\nUSE\n\nSERVE\n\nTIlE\n\nECONOMY\n\nI\'ROJECTS:\nLAUNCtl\n\n--\n\nAPPLICATION\n\n--\n\nSATELLITE\n\nwhere the\n\nFigure\n\nVEIIICLE\nSATELLITE\nAPPLICATION\n\nTECttNOLOGY\n\nWS-25\n\nand\n\nthe mission\nACHIEVEMENTS\n\nagainst\n\noverall\n\nWITtt\n\nOVER\n\nschedules.\n\n38 YEARS\n\nEFFORTS,\n\nCHINA\n\nABILITIES\n\n--\n\nTO RESEARCH,\nSATELLITES\n\nLAUNCHING\nXICHANG,\n\nMr. Goldin, our NASA administrator,\nat the White House on March 27 re-\n\ngarding reinvention\ngovernment:\n\nSPACE\n\nECONOMIC\n\nAND\n\nAND TEST\n\nTo quote\nhis statement\n\niTS\n\nSTRONG\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nALMS:\n\nfrom\n\nproducts\n\nto execute\n\nand measured\n\nSPACE\n\nDEVELOPING\n\nare clearly defined and have deadlines\nmatched\n\nSPACE\n\nand contractor\n\noperations\n\nnecessary\n\nCHINA\n\nIT LACKED\n\n--\n\nare changed\n\nIS INTO\n\nWS-24\n\nMAJOR\n\nThe processes\n\nWORLD\n\nand restructuring\n\nBASES\n\nDESIGN,\n\nMANUFACTURE\n\nAND LAUNCH\n\nSUCH\n\nAND XI\'AN\n\nDEVELOPED\n\nVEHICLES;\n\nAS JIUQUAN,\n\nSATELLITE\n\nTAIYUAN\n\nCONTROL\n\nAND\n\nCENTER;\n\nin\n--\n\nLONG\n\nMARCH\n\nCARRIED\n\nSERIES\n\nLAUNCH\n\nOUT 36 MISSIONS\n\nVEHICLES\n\nHAVING\n\nSUCCESSFULLY;\n\nin the federal\nCOMMUNICATIONS,\nREMOTE SENSING\nSATELLITES,\n\n"NASA is an investment in America\'s\nfuture.\nThe new NASA, as before, will inspire the\nnext generation of explorers but cost the U.S.\ntaxpayer less.

Although China has no strong economic power and advanced science and technology,\nChina has raised money to develop launch vehicles,\napplication technologies,\nsatellites and satellite application, following the principle of "developing space, for\npeaceful use and serving the economy."\nNext slide\nplease (Fig. WS- 26).\nChina now has highly skilled professional\ntechnicians and workers. China owns the Jiuquan, Taiyuan,\nand Xichang satellite launching bases and Than satellite control center, which are capable of launching low\nEarth orbit satellite, sun-synchronous\norbit satellites,\nand geostationary\norbit satellites. China has also developed a high-energy,\ncryogenic fuel technology for\nlaunch vehicles, rocket strap-on technology,\nand technology for lauching multiple satellites with one rocket.\nLong March Series Launch Vehicles have launched 36\ncommercial\nmissions successfully.\nChina is also improving its satellite recovery technology\nand remote\nsensing, telemetry,\nand telecontrol\ntechnologies.\nNext\nslide please (Fig. WS- 27).\nThe development\nand application of China\'s space\ntechnology has played a special and indispensable\nrole\nin China\'s modernization\nconstruction.\nNext slide\nplease (Fig. WS- 28). The Chinese government\nattaches great importance to the development\nof space\nresources and space technology and has included space\ntechnology as a part of its overall national development strategy. The National Mid- and Long-term\nProgram for Scientific and Technological\nDevelopment\nfor 2000 to 2020 focuses on strengthening\nthe development and research of space power systems, propulsion,\nT\'I\'&C, and manned space technologies.\nNext slide\nplease (Fig. WS- 29).\nWe are preparing\n"The Sustainable\nDevelopment\nAction Plan for the Promotion of China Space Application."

Through these friendly contacts, mutual understanding and friendship have been enhanced. As a\nresult, mutual interest in several cooperative projects\nhas been expressed. In 1984, both parties prepared to\nsign a protocol on space cooperation.\nMr. Richard\nJohnson, the former assistant director in the White\nHouse Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, proposed that Chinese scientific experimental\nequipment\nand Chinese astronauts\ncould be deployed aboard the\nU.S. space shuttle. For various reasons, however,\ncontacts between our two sides have been suspended\nfor several years, and cooperation\ndocuments have not\ncome to any conclusion.\nNonetheless\nsince 1988, the\nChina Great Wall Industry Corporation\n(CGWlC), a\nsubordinate to China National Space Administration,\nand Hughes have cooperated\nin commercial\nlaunching\nservice. Three agreements between the two governments were signed at the end of 1988 and beginning of\n1989.\n\nto launch satellite manufactured\nin the U.S. on Chinese vehicles for the third party or third country.\nThrough our cooperative programs we have not only\ndeveloped a good relationship\nwith Hughes Space\nAircraft Company, but also with Space Systems/Loral,\nLockheed Martin, and other companies. This next\nslide shows the planned launches (Fig. WS- 33).\nWe have found launch services can be also beneficial for other industry cooperations\nbetween China and\nthe U.S. Taking Iridium as a good example, we invest\n75 million American dollars to be a member of board\ndirectors of Iridium Inc. We import ground equipment.\nEventually cellular telephone systems of Motorola will\nwin the Chinese telecommunication\nmarket.\nLaunching\nservice is only a part of space cooperation. We are greatly encouraged when we look at the\noverall cooperation\nin the space sector between our\ntwo countries. In January 1995, a joint Sino-U.S.\nScience and Technology\nCommission\nmeeting was held\nin Beijing. One of the meeting highlights was space\ncooperation.\nBoth sides agreed that potential areas of\nspace cooperation\nmight include Earth science and\nglobal change research, telemedicine,\nand space sciences.\nThe exchange was warmly received by Mr. Goldin\nof NASA and his colleagues. The meaningful and\neloquent speech Mr. Goldin delivered during the Joint\nCommission\nMeeting has left a very good and deep\nimpression on the Chinese participants.\nLater this year\nsenior people from China National Space Administration might be here in Washington\nD.C. It is my hope\nthose mutual visits will open a new chapter in the\nspace cooperation between China and U.S.\nI do believe that as time passes, mutual understanding will deepen, and our cooperation\nin space\ntechnology will be further developed and more extensive with promising and effective prospects.\nFinally, please allow me to conclude my speech\nwith some words from the speech Mr. Goldin delivered in Beijing: "Collaboration\nin space can be a catalytic action for making this world a safer and more\n\nOn behalf of the Chinese and the U.S. governments, Administrator\nLiu Jiyuan and Ambassador\nKantor signed a new seven-year Commercial\nSpace\nLaunch Agreement in Beijing on March 13, 1995. To\ndate, six satellites for international\ncustomers have\nbeen successfully\nlaunched by the Chinese Long\nMarch vehicles. CGWIC has also contracted with\nseveral American companies to launch 30 more satellites. This partnership\nis paving the way for future\ncooperation\non satellites and satellite ground application systems.\nIn 1988 and 1994, I had the honor to participate in\nall the consultations\nbetween our two governments.\nIn\nmy opinion, it is a very good and typical cooperation\n\n140\n\nWS-33\n\nTHE\n\npeaceful place. When nations work together on bold\nand noble tasks to benefit humankind,\nwe build understanding, respect, and trust." Thank you.\nDR. DAILE\xc2\xa5: Thank you very much for a most enlightening speech. Our next speaker is someone who it\ngives me great pleasure to introduce, someone I got to\nknow when I was serving in government\nmyself. He,\nof course, is Dr. Roland Dor6, who, since October\n1994, has been serving as the president of International Space University in Strausberg,\nFrance. ISU is\nan international\nand multidisciplinary\ninstitution preparing professionals\nto respond to the current needs\nand evolving demands of the space sector in a rapidly\nchanging world, truly the ones that are going to be\nproviding our visions and reality in the future.\nPrior to that, though, he held the distinguished\nposition as the president of the Canadian Space\nAgency in May 1992 until July 1994. From 1960 to\n1992, Dr. Dor6 has occupied various professional\nand\nadministrative\npositions in Canada. In 1980 he was\nappointed dean of Research of the Col Holitique and\ndean and director in 1982. He went on to become the\nCol\'s principal and chairman of the board in 1989\nuntil 1992 when he was appointed the head of the\nCanadian Space Agency.\nDr. Dor6 has authored or co-authored more than\n70 scientific papers published in reference journals,\nand he has lectured extensively at international\nconferences devoting his career to engineering,\neducation,\nand research. We welcome Dr. Dor6.\nDR. DORI_: Thank you Mr. Chairman; my friend, Mr.\nGoldin; ladies and gentlemen. Of course I want to talk\nto you about the International\nSpace University.\nBut\nsince we\'re in the business of training and preparing\nyoung professionals\nfor the space world of tomorrow\nand since this space world is changing, I would like to\ngive you my views about why it is changing, how it\nwill change, and how this will affect the education\nprograms around the world to prepare these people.\nOf course, these are not new ideas, but it might\ncome from a different perspective,\na perspective of\nsomebody who is part of a neutral organization\nthat\nhas to do with education.\nThe world is changing now, and it will be changing in the future. But there are two main factors, I\nthink, that are lasting factors that will trigger that\nprogress in the future, the change that will come in the\nfuture years.\nFirst is the realignment of the world political\nstructure. It\'s now tentative. Of course there was a\nmajor event that happened in 1989 and the early\n1990s, but the situation in Russia, if you look at it, is\nstill very unstable, and we hope that our friends from\nRussia will go through that difficult period with a\nhappy ending. This has triggered, of course, (it was\nmentioned this morning when we had the very good\n\nWORLD\n\nIS INTO\n\nSPACE\n\nsession when the military people in this country presented their views on the future of space) a lot of\ninstability all over the world.\nAnd the second major, and I think lasting also,\nreason why the world is changing and how it affects\nspace is the world economic crisis. This crisis will not\nlast for long. So I hope it will be short, but it will be\nlonger than the past crisis.\n\nI do believe that as time passes,\nunderstanding\ncooperation\nfurther\n\nand our\n\nin space technology\n\ndeveloped\n\npromising\n\nwill deepen,\n\nmutual\nwill be\n\nand more extensive\n\nand effective\n\nwith\n\nprospects.\n\nSo are the consequences\nof these two major factors\non the space sector. And if you look at the second\none, the question of economics is that the space sector\nis bound now to generate benefit at the social level and\nthe economic level. It means that now space will be\npulled--the\ndevelopment\nof space infrastructure\nand\nspace activity will be pulled--by\nneeds and not only\npushed by the technology.\nYou know, the engineers\n(I\'m an engineer; I know the way we are.) we have a\nnew technology,\nwe say we\'re going to push that, this\nis finished. It won\'t be like that in the world. The\nneeds could be a scientific need; we\'ve talked about\nthat. It could be a need to explore the universe; this is\na need. But it won\'t be pushed by technology;\nit will\nbe pulled--these\ndevelopments--by\nthe fact we have a\nneed to accomplish.\nThe technologies\nare, of course,\navailable most of the time. And especially when we\nlook at the domain of applications\nthat are more directly related with social needs; that is, telecommunication and Earth observation.\nIn those two domains\nespecially, the driver will be how much economic\nbenefit can we pull out of these activities.\nAnd the second consequence\nof this reorganization\nof the world scene is the fact that the international\ncooperation\nin many sectors (but particularly\nin space\nbecause these programs are very costly and they involve many countries),\nthe international\nnature of the\nspace activity, will certainly follow directly. Of\ncourse, this is not new, cooperation\nat the international\nlevel, but I think the level will increase tremendously.\nThere are other consequences\nof these major\nchanges in the world--the\nreduction of space budget\ncoming from governments.\nPeople are talking about a\nlevel budget. I don\'t think so. For civilian programs I\nthink the budget will go down because the private\nsector will take over the sector of application and\ntelecommunication\nuntil it\'s done; in fact, it is done.\nThe governments\nare investing only in technologies\nof\nthe future. They don\'t invest anymore in developing\n\n141\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nthe satellites. The companies are doing that. This will\ncome also in the Earth observation\nbusiness. It might\ntake longer because the economic benefit of the Earth\nobservation\nmight not be as evident as those in telecommunications,\nbut it will come. So it doesn\'t mean\nthat the total spending in space will go down, but\ncertainly the spending coming from government\nwill\ngo down and will be focused more in science and the\ndevelopment\nof technology\nof the future, science being\nunderstood as science material, exploration,\nmanned\nspace activities and so on.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2..this\n\nnew reality of internationalism\n\nus to consider\n\nanother\n\nform of training.\n\nhave to give a broad education\nyoung professionals\nresponsibility\n\nforces\nWe\n\nto those\n\nwho will have the\n\nto develop the infrastructure\n\nand the space applications\n\nfor the needs of\n\nfuture generations.\n\nThere will be a new equilibrium\nin players. There\nused to be two major players in space, but now it\'s\nspreading. Look at what India has accomplished\nin the\npast 15 years. It\'s tremendous\nwhat they\'ve accomplished in the past 15 years. But we will see also the\nincreased importance\nof the countries that are not\nproviders of a space infrastructure\nbut that are users of\nspace infrastructure,\nespecially in telecommunication\nand Earth observation.\nThese countries will be players\nthat are of importance\nbecause part of the economic\nbenefit--the\ngreatest part of the economic benefit--is\ncoming not from what we put in space. What we put\nin space is spending. It\'s what we do with that on\nEarth in terms of especially telecommunication\nand\nEarth observation.\nWe will see, of course, the convergence\nof civilian\nand military programs.\nThis morning there was a good\nsession; there was a good turnout of civilian and mUitary people, and this intention was clearly stated. It\'s\nnot so obvious this afternoon, but that\'s it.\nMajor changes of attitude in space cooperation,\nspace agencies. Mr. Dordain just mentioned that we\nhave to change our attitude in space agencies. NASA\nis doing that now, but it will also be done in cooperation. If we look at the production of space products\nthat are flowing out of our borders, the borders being\nEurope, being Japan, being United States...\nI mean,\nit\'s minimal. It\'s minimal because companies are being\nfed by government\nprograms.\nBut now we\'re entering\nan era where we will see probably the downfall of\nthese barriers, and companies will be entering the path\nof competition.\nThat means, if you have to train for a\nmarathon, of course, you don\'t do it by driving a car.\n\n142\n\nThis is what we\'ve been doing in the past, because\ncompanies, it was easy, I know, because I\'ve seen it in\nCanada. Companies were being fed by government\nprograms but now they have to be competitive,\nand so\nthey will have to step out of their cars and start training for a marathon which is difficult. It\'s a difficult\ntask. So, I\'m sorry. I\'m sorry, being crude sometimes,\nbut this is my view.\nSo what about space and education? Of course,\nwe\'re talking about international,\neconomic benefits.\nWe need different types of people. We used to train,\nwe still train, and we still mean to train specialists and\nengineers who can develop space infrastructure.\nWe\nneed scientists, we need managers, we need lawyers to\ntell us if we can put a satellite disk at that place or that\nplace. But we need also those people who not only\ncome with their technology baggage of knowledge,\nbut\nalso the openness of mind to understand\nthat when\nwe\'re proposing a new space program, money has to\nbe involved, management has to be involved, law has\nto be involved. And, of course, this is a new type of\nperson.\nThis is the vision that our founders, three young\ngraduates from MIT, had in the early \'80s. These\nthree young men saw that the space world would\nchange in the way it is changing now. And they said,\n"We need to train people with a broader view on\nspace activities."\nSpace and Education--Contribution\ntional Space University flSU)\n\nof the Interna-\n\nSpace activities are now becoming more and more\ninternational. It is obvious that we need to consider the\ntraining of our space professional\nin this new context.\nAnd in fact, in many of our countries, we do have\nprograms by which we train specialists,\nin space medicine, in engineering,\nin science. In some cases it is\nalso in management\nof space activities or in space\npolicies. But, this new reality of internationalism\nforces us to consider another form of training. We\nhave to give a broad education to those young professionals who will have the responsibility\nto develop the\ninfrastructure\nand the space applications\nfor the needs\nof future generations.\nHow does the International\nSpace\ncontribute to fulfill such a need?\n\nUniversity\n\n(ISU)\n\nSince its creation in 1987, the ISU has been a truly\nmultidisciplinary\nand international\ninstitution preparing\nindividuals to respond to the current needs, and the\nincreasing and evolving demands, of the space sector\nin a rapidly changing world. ISU\'s greatest strength is\nits diversity and heterogeneity--both\nintrinsic components of space activities today. ISU considers space\nactivities not as isolated actions undertaken by a narrow community,\nbut as a global undertaking\nof human-\n\nTHE WORLD IS\nINTOSPACE\nity in which diverse systems and new technologies\nflourish. This calls for a non-traditional\napproach to\nthe education of space professionals.\nISU offers a multidisciplinary\ncurriculum\nstressing\ninteractions between disciplines within an international\nsetting. It considers this approach to be an essential\ncomplement\nto traditional training structured around\none or two disciplines.\nIntegrating the output of skilled\nspecialists requires professionals\nwho can see a\nbroader picture. Without sufficient understanding\nof\nthe full range of space disciplines, complex space\nprograms can not be effectively managed. ISU students\nstudy the broad spectrum of space-related\ndisciplines\nwhich gives them the opportunity\nto expand their\nperspectives\nand to understand the complex interactions among disciplines.\nStudying with professional\ncolleagues from around\nthe world leads students into a worldwide network and\ninto a new way of working. Participants join the rapidly growing ISU community which provides unparalleled resources of information\nand expertise spread\nthrough governmental,\nindustrial, and research institutions around the world. The ISU educational process\nhelps participants\nto overcome the cultural barriers\nwhich often impede progress on international\nspace\nprograms.\nThe ISU educational programs are structured so that participants\nlearn to work effectively with\nprofessional\ncolleagues from diverse cultural backgrounds with different problem-solving\napproaches.\nISU currently offers two educational programs:\nthe\nSummer Sessions (SSP) and the Master of Space Studies (MSS). Both programs offer opportunities\nfor\nindividuals to acquire a wide-ranging\nknowledge of\nspace-related\ndisciplines together with a greatly enhanced understanding\nof how space activities really\nwork. The engineering\ndisciplines,\nthe pure and applied sciences, law, management,\npolicy studies, and\nhumanities are among the disciplines studied. Both the\nspace segments and the ground segments of space\nprojects are dealt with, as well as their utilization and\ntheir impact on society.\nThe ISU Summer Session is an intensive 10-week\nprogram which provides an overview of space activities all over the world. The annual program, offered\neach year since 1988, is held at different universities\nand research centers around the world. The ISU Summer Session offers a unique educational experience,\nhighly valued by the more than 850 alumni from 56\ncountries who have already participated.\nThe multidisciplinary\ncurriculum,\nwith its emphasis on international cooperation,\nopens the student to new perspectives on the world\'s space activities, perspectives\notherwise reserved for those with many years of varied\nprofessional\nexperience.\nAll the major space-related\ndisciplines are studied. This, in combination with the\nteam work of the Design Projects, broadens the participants\' knowledge beyond that of their original specialization and gives them a greatly improved awareness\n\nof the total system. Some 450 space specialists from\n25 countries have contributed as lecturers, faculty\nmembers and invited speakers during the past seven\nSummer Sessions.\nThe MSS is a graduate-level\nprogram designed for\nindividuals seeking professional\ndevelopment\nor further academic study by working towards a one-year\ndegree. This new and unique program will be launched\nin September\n1995 in Strasbourg,\nFrance for a class of\n30 to 40 students.\nFor experienced\nprofessionals,\nthe MSS program\nis organized to support career advancement,\na career\nshift within the space sector, or a career move into the\nspace sector.\nFor students who wish to follow a more academically oriented career, the MSS can lead to research\nopportunities\nincluding a Ph.D. program. In the same\ncontext, the MSS could be integrated into a Ph.D.\nprogram that the student is already pursuing. The MSS\nprogram could also constitute a complementary\neducational component after a Ph.D. program, preparing\nindividuals for professional\nlife in industry or government agencies.\n\nThe multidisciplinary\nemphasis\n\ncurriculum,\n\non international\n\nwith its\n\ncooperation,\n\nopens the student to new perspectives\nworld\'s\notherwise\n\nspace activities,\nreserved\n\nof varied\n\non the\n\nperspectives\n\nfor those with many years\n\nprofessional\n\nexperience.\n\nSpace development\nwill remain an important sector\nof activity for the foreseeable future. Space programs\nhave brought major direct, practical benefits to humankind through telecommunications,\nremote sensing, and\nother applications.\nSpace programs are essential for\nthe conduct of many areas of pure and applied scientific research, from astronomy to bio-medical\nresearch.\nSpace programs can also capture the human imagination and provide an unequaled outlet for the human\nspirit of adventure, especially by enabling men and\nwomen to venture into space.\nThe MSS program has been shaped by the need to\nsustain a suitably educated body of professionals\ncapable of adequately managing this important worldwide\nactivity. The creation of a space program, the implementation of the space segment and the ground segment, the exploitation of the results of the program,\nand its interpretation\nto society at large is a very complex process. A very wide range of scientific, engineering and management\nfactors must be combined,\ntaking into account the economic, legal, political, and\ncultural environment\nin which the space program takes\nplace. The successful integration of these disparate\n\n143\n\n1 ITH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nelements into a workable system requires a body of\nhighly capable professionals.\nSkilled specialists are, of course, essential to this\nprocess. Equally important are people who have an\nadequate breadth of knowledge of all the relevant\ndisciplines,\nboth technical and non-technical,\nand who\nare able to see the system as a whole. Since space\nprograms very often involve cooperation between\nnations or cooperation\nbetween private companies in\ndifferent nations, one special quality that is of great\nimportance is the ability to work effectively and efficiently with professional\ncolleagues from different\ncultures having widely different working methods. It is\nthis breadth of knowledge,\ncombined with the ability\nto manage the interactions between disciplines and the\nability to operate on an international\nplane that the\nMSS program will impart to its students.\n\nInternational,\n\nmulticultural\n\ninterdisciplinarymthese\nprinciples\n\nof ISU\'s activities.\n\nand\n\nare the three\nIn this way ISU\n\nhopes to create, for the 21st century\nbeyond,\n\nand\n\na new synergy among the people of\nthe world.\n\nThe MSS program provides an opportunity\nfor\nprofessional\ndevelopment\nand academic advancement.\nIn particular, the participants\nwill:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 gain a comprehensive\nbase of knowledge in all major\nspace-related\ndisciplines (technical and non-technical)\nand their interrelationships.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 become part of an active worldwide network of\nprofessional\ncolleagues.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 take part in a design project, which will provide an\nopportunity\n- to learn through experience how to work with\ncolleagues from around the world,\n- to put into practice the theoretical instruction,\nand\n- to confront the challenge of creating a realistic\ndesign of an international\nspace program.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 pursue an area of specialization\nthrough advanced\nlectures and seminars in selected topics.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 undertake an individual project linked with an\neight-week placement period for practical training in a\nforeign space agency or company or for specialized\ncourses and research at an ISU Affiliate.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 develop the professional\nskills and personal qualities\nrequired to design, implement,\nlead, and manage space\nprograms.\nThe main tools to achieve the stated objectives are\na balanced series of lectures on all major disciplines\nrelated to space; design projects of a nature involving\nmost, if not all, of those disciplines;\nand a series of\n\n144\n\nlectures on contemporary\nissues and events which as a\nwhole provide a multidisciplinary\neducation.\nISU is committed to the concept of a close student-teacher\nrelationship\nin which continued personal\ninteraction constitutes a substantial part of the educational process. The formal supervision\nof each individual student will be ensured by a guiding committee\nwhich will include a guiding professor from the central\ncampus and an academic mentor from an affiliate, and\nmay include other people involved in the student\'s\ntraining. The guiding committee will be responsible\nfor the academic well being of the student and will\nprovide advice and guidance to the student on academic issues such as selecting advanced courses and a\ndesign project, and choosing an affiliate or host institution for the placement period.\nThe Summer Sessions and Master of Space Studies\nprograms are supported by a unique campus consisting\nof a central campus and a number of affiliates (24\naffiliates at the present time), linked together through\nelectronic communication\nand information\nsystems.\nThe central campus of ISU is located in\nStrasbourg,\nFrance and provides the main facilities for\nthe MSS program.\nThe ISU affiliates are located at institutions around\nthe world. The affiliates are integral partners in ISU\nand exchange faculty members, conduct joint research,\nprovide students to the MSS program, host students\nduring their placement period, supervise them during\nthe MSS program, cooperate in the MSS curriculum\ndefinition, and work with the central campus on other\nmutual academic endeavors.\nAfter the MSS program,\nthe affiliates may select some qualified MSS graduates\nto undertake further study or research.\nISUnet connects the many elements and constituencies of ISU--the faculty, students, and alumni-through\nInternet. ISUnet will utilize the most\nappropriate communication\nand information\ntechnologies to provide a simple and cost effective electronic\nnetwork among the ISU campus elements, additional\ninstitutions and corporations\nalong with suitable electronic databases.\nClosely integrated with ISUnet is the ISU Information Resources Center which provides library and\nother information\nresources to ISU faculty, students,\nand the affiliates. ISU will be electronically\nlinked to\nlibraries around the world. Students will also have\nopen access to the libraries of the Strasbourg universities.\nISU intends to maintain a balance between teaching and research. Considering the wide-ranging\ndisciplines of ISU programs,\nsome faculty members will be\nactively engaged in development\nprograms and other\ncreative activities in addition to traditional research\nactivities. ISU, with its international\nand multidisciplinary\ncharacter,\nintends to become a catalyst for\nthe conception of new research and development\nprograms and other creative activities.\n\nTHE\n\nIn all of these activities, ISU professors--supported by students, research/teaching\nassistants, and\nMSS graduates--will\ntake the leading role. Collaboration with research groups in the affiliates and other\ninstitutions will be strongly encouraged.\nTo favor the\nbest environment\nfor research by the academic personnel of ISU, institutional\nsupport will be provided for\nthe development\nof research facilities as the central\ncampus grows and consolidates.\nInternational,\nmulticultural\nand interdisciplinary-these\nare the three principles of ISU\'s activities.\nIn this way ISU hopes to create, for the 21st century\nand beyond, a new synergy among the people of the\nworld.\nThank\n\nyou.\n\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you, Roland. Now, our last\nspeaker is Mr. Lon Rains, who is the editor of Space\nNews. Lon has been editor of Space News since 1993.\nHe is responsible for all of the newspaper\'s\nnews and\neditorial coverage. Lon joined Space News in October\n1989 as the Advanced Technology\nand Soviet Space\nProgram reporter. He was responsible for covering the\nformer Soviet Union\'s military and civilian space\nprograms and a number of civilian and military space\nprograms in the United States.\nIn January 1991 he was promoted to senior editor\nand supervised the editing staff, freelance writers, and\nthe production\nof the newspaper. As a deputy to the\neditor of Space News, he also wrote editorials and was\nresponsible\nfor all facets of the newspaper\'s\npublication in the editor\'s absence.\nHe has worked as a journalist\nsince 1982. He\ncame to Space News from Prince George\'s Journal, a\ndaily newspaper in the Washington,\nD.C. suburbs. His\nassignments\nat the Journal were federal government,\nincluding coverage of the Goddard Space Flight Center; the Maryland Congressional\nDelegation; and the\nMaryland Legislator\nand Governor.\nHe also has covered federal and state courts. He holds a bachelor\'s\ndegree in political science from The University of\nMaryland,\nand I also join in welcoming Lon to the\npodium.\nMR. RAINS: Thank you, Brian. I\'ve been asked to\nsum up the last couple of days of discussion of vision\nand reality, and as the last speaker I feel it\'s my moral\nobligation to be brief, so I\'ll try to do that. Before I\nstart, I want to thank Dick MacLeod and a great staff\nof volunteers\nfor the great job they\'ve done this week.\nHow close the vision is to reality in a space program depends on which program you\'re talking about,\nand clearly, commercial,\nmilitary and civil space programs are at very different evolutionary\nstages right\nnow, as are space programs in different countries.\nI want to start off with the military space programs, because I believe those are where the gap\nbetween vision and reality is currently at its widest.\n\nWORLD\n\nIS INTO SPACE\n\nSpace systems and aerospace technology took center\nstage on the battlefield during the Gulf War, and in the\nmonths that followed, there was a lot of talk about\nwhat an impetus their success in the war would be to\nthe development\nand expansion of U.S. military space\ncapabilities.\nIt didn\'t happen, at least not the way a lot\nof people thought it might. The U.S. budget deficit is\ntoo large, and space programs are as vulnerable as any\nother system as the defense budget continues to shrink.\nIronically,\nfor the United States at least, is the Europeans, who took the lessons of the Gulf War to heart and\nthey\'re moving quickly to develop an independent\nmilitary capability in space.\nThe good news is that budget pressure is forcing\nthe Pentagon to change its ways, and while such\nchange is very slow, there are positive trends such as\nthe move to make much better use of the technology\navailable on the commercial\nmarket. But all in all,\nmilitary and intelligence spacecraft are too large, too\nexpenswe, and too inefficiently\nmanaged.\n\nThe U.S. budget\nspace programs\n\ndeficit is too large, and\nare as vulnerable\n\nother system as the defense\ncontinues\n\nas any\n\nbudget\n\nto shrink.\n\nThe good news is that there are pockets of resistance within the Pentagon, in secret little corners of\nthe military. There are some bright and innovative\nspacecraft managers who know what needs to be done.\nThe biggest favor the top brass and a lot of managers\nin the middle could do is get out of their way and let\nthem show what they can do. I think that\'s important,\nbecause the need for space systems has not diminished;\nit\'s increased.\nThe threats are different than those the U.S. faced\nin the Cold War; but particularly\nwhen you talk about\nthe growing ballistic missile threat, it\'s growing even\nas the budget shrinks. In that environment,\nmoving\naway from the current over-reliance\non large, multibillion dollar satellites is essential. I think the National\nReconnaissance\nOffice, in particular,\nneeds to reinvent\nthe way it manages spacecraft development\nand also\nstart thinking about developing a small spacecraft\ncapability. Every mission does not require the most\nup-to-date and technically sophisticated\nspacecraft\npossible.\nWhether they should or not, defense budgets are\nnot going to grow and are likely to continue to shrink.\nEven if the funding is stabilized, space systems will\nhave to compete with a long list of equally pressing\nneeds. The only way to get more capability in space is\nto get a lot smarter about the way we spend these\nSCarCe\n\nresources.\n\n145\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nNASA, I think, is slightly further along in the\nattempt to streamline and modernize. But make no\nmistake, the movement that Dan Goldin started three\nyears ago to remake NASA is only beginning. Despite\nall the talk about pain and cuts, NASA\'s budget has\nnot been cut significantly\nto date. It is still $14 billion,\nand that\'s a lot of money. If the five-year budget outlook for NASA recommended\nby the White House this\nyear becomes reality, the change ahead will have to be\nfar more revolutionary\nthan the changes to date.\nBut give NASA credit. Dan Goldin does have a\nvision of what NASA should be, and he\'s doing more\nthan any agency head in the U.S. Federal government\nto streamline,\ndownsize, and innovate. If every government manager was a tenth as aggressive as Dan\nGoldin has been, the country would be in far better\nshape.\n\nCommercial\n\nspace activities\n\ntoday are far and\n\naway some of the most exciting things\nhappening\n\nin the industry.\n\nIt is where the\n\ndirect broadcast television. The remote sensing industry and the commercial\nuse of GPS technology are\ncreating vibrant new markets. The amazing thing about\nthe commercial\nmarket is that things are booming\neven, as Steve Dorfman noted yesterday, as launch\ncosts become an ever larger part of doing business.\nImagine the industry\'s potential if launch can become\nmore affordable and more reliant.\nI continue to believe the visionaries\nlike Tom\nRogers also have it right when they say the only way\nto ever get the public\'s full support for space programs\nis to begin shaping programs in a way that includes the\naverage person in a very personal way.\nFor those of you who were here on the opening\nnight, I want to say to Jim Lovell that a lot of those\nhippies he talked about were supporting the space\nprogram then, and as those people enter middle age\nnow, they still share with many people in this room\nthe vision of a space program that will allow them to\nleave low Earth orbit or to reach low Earth orbit in\ntheir lifetime. The longer they\'re shut out of participating in that vision, the harder it will be to find the\nmoney to make it a reality. Thank you.\n\nvision clearly is closest to reality.\nQ&A\n\nThat\'s why I think the White House made a big\nmistake this year when it asked NASA to reduce that\nfive-year budget plan by as much as $8 billion. On\none level, it\'s reasonable to ask any government agency to scale back when industry has been doing it for\nyears. But it seems to me that when an agency has\nbeen more aggressive about changing itself than any\nother part of the federal bureaucracy,\nit sends the\nwrong message to reward the innovator by asking him\nto cut even deeper once he has proved that he can do\nit. The message there to other agency heads is to drag\nyour feet and fight for your budget because if you\ninnovate, you will only be cut faster and deeper.\nThere are legitimate reasons for keeping NASA\'s\nbudget at least at current levels. As too many speakers\nhave noted this week and for too many years to count,\nthe high cost of space launch continues to inhibit the\ngrowth of the space business. While the X-33 and X34 efforts are an encouraging\nsign that the United\nStates may, may, tackle this problem in a significant\nway, it is not the priority that it should be or could be.\nIt\'s a shame because new launch technology could add\neven more impetus to an already thriving commercial\nspace business.\nCommercial\nspace activities today are far and\naway some of the most exciting things happening in\nthe industry. It is where the vision clearly is closest to\nreality. The satellite communications\nindustry, for\nyears the only profit-making\nspace enterprise, is\npoised for dramatic expansion of new businesses like\nsatellite-based\nmobile telephone and data service and\n\n146\n\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you, Lon, for being succinct and\nit has helped, I think, give us some more time for\nquestions and answers. If I might ask all the participants to turn on their microphones,\nwe\'ll be able to\ndirect some questions and, I think, get some interesting dialogue here.\nFirst question goes to Mr. Goldin. Speakers in this\nmorning\'s\nsession and Representative\nWalker spoke of\nhow the U.S. "must dominate" space. How is "domination" international\ncooperation?\nMR. GOLDIN: Space, like any other area, requires\nthat each country do things in the national interest.\nSpace is not going to be WASA, the World Aeronautics and Space Administration.\nSpace is going to be\ndone on a government\nbasis when it\'s in the national\ninterest of each government\nto do it. And if it is in the\nnational interest of each government\nto participate\nin\nspecific programs,\nthey will do it. In the commercial\nsector, the same thing happens. Global alliances get\nformed, a corporation\nis in the lead, it is in their interest to work with other corporations\nbecause it generates new markets. So there\'s no contradiction.\nAmerica does what it believes is right, and Congressman Walker indicated that there are areas where\nAmerica wants to develop technologies\nand leadership\nin the new world. Leadership\nin the new world will\ncome by doing things at a much higher level of technology with system management\nskills so that the\ncountry can grow and prosper and in that way, interact\nwith other nations.\n\nTHE\n\nSo I don\'t think there\'s any contradiction.\nI think\nit\'s the right thing to do. Where countries can do\nthings of mutual interest, and there isn\'t a competitive\naspect, we ought to do it.\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you. The next question goes to\nMr. Johns. If the international\ninformation\nsuperhighway becomes a reality but uses fiberoptics, will the\ncommunication\nand space industries suffer major market share losses?\nMR. JOHNS: In fact, in my view, the satellite industries are going to be a very important part of the GII,\nthe Global Information Infrastructure. Much of our\ncommercial\napplication has been broadcast cable and\nso on, which is a one-way sport. Increasingly, we are\ngoing to be talking about real-time video band widths\nand an interactive transfer of information between\npeople, between governments, between corporations.\nAnd it\'s going to be a ubiquitous system. In similar\nhigh capacity two-way systems, they are going to be\nan important part of the warfighter\'s\nfuture and is\nbecoming so.\nCables, satellite--all\nof them--are\ngoing to be\nimportant and I believe, personally, that the satellites\nhave some real advantages. In fact, being competitive\nis important if, for example, the broadcasters don\'t\nmove to a high-definition,\nhigh-quality signal, they are\nlikely to become like AM radio is to FM radio. If\ncable doesn\'t produce a high-quality\nsignal, it is going\nto be outrun by satellites. I happen to have both cable\nand satellite. And it is a signal that is so much better\nthan the cable signal I receive at home today. I do\nhave a good television set. It is ready for high-definition aspect ratios, and it has Mpeg-2--that\nis the modern compression scheme. The satellite folks are going\nto outrun these terrestrial systems if the terrestrial\nsystems don\'t start running faster.\nSo I wouldn\'t worry about those folks. The more\ncompetition,\nthe better off we are because the services\nthat you and I and everybody in the world get in their\nhomes, whether it\'s for education, entertainment,\nculture or communications,\ntelemedicine,\nwarnings,\nthe wide variety of uses that are going to evolve.\nThose services are going to be more affordable for all\nof us, when companies compete and countries compete\nto provide it for us.\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you. Dr. Stone, what do you see\nas the role of manned space exploration versus robotic\nexploration?\nDR. STONE:\nI think they really serve complementary\npurposes. Human exploration is something which\ninvolves human beings going there, and ultimately,\nthere\'s really no substitute for human beings going\nthere. On the other hand, there\'s a great deal that can\nbe done with robotic exploration.\nWith Mars, for\n\nWORLD\n\nIS INTO\n\nSPACE\n\ninstance, it\'s very clear that the robotic exploration is\nvery important for setting the stage because human\nexploration will be much more complex. That means\nwe need to be sure, when we send humans to Mars,\nwe take best advantage of their capability to explore\nthe most interesting spots on Mars. That means we\nneed to understand Mars a great deal better than we do\ntoday robotically before one would want to send the\nvery precious resource of human explorers.\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you. Mr. O\'Neill: American\nbusinesses have downsized to the point where some of\nthem are useless. How will NASA know when it has\ndownsized enough?\nMR. O\'NEILL:\nI think we will restructure\nin the\noperations part of the business on the basis of the\ntechnology that allows us to restructure\nand still manage the risk appropriately. We are challenged to downsize in many of our processes simply to make the\nfunds available for the development of the new programs, robotic spacecraft, human endeavors or whatever. I think we\'re developing really quite a good\nhandle on our restructuring activity and the goals to go\nafter. The review team activity over the past two years\nhas given us a very solid basis.\nI might say that perhaps the most important part of\nthe review team activity is that it has involved people\nfrom other areas of the agency and, yes indeed, people\noutside the agency, and so we\'ve developed a perspective and a methodology for looking at how we might\napproach restructuring. But we\'ll keep a careful eye\nout on it. We will report to Dan Goidin and our associate administrators, as appropriate, on our progress in\nthese different areas.\nI might go ahead and say that in operations we\'ve,\non occasion, been accused of being a little too afraid\nto make change. I\'m going to turn that into a positive\nthing that we\'ll keep a careful eye out for not destablizing the important processes and yet take advantage\nof the technology, the smart ways to operate, and the\nthings that industry can indeed do more cheaply for\nus, keeping those things firmly in mind and utilizing\nthem.\nMR. GOLDIN: Let me say this, we are not downsizing\nNASA. We are bringing NASA into the 21st century.\nWhen the term downsizing\nis used, it connotes a negative action. NASA is ripe with opportunity\nfor restructuring for the next century. And people shouldn\'t be\nafraid of doing things that need to be done. There is\nno reason to operate a launch system with 35,000\npeople. In fact, it\'s a crime on the space program that\nthat is what we\'re doing. There is no reason that we\nhave marketing teams at each of our centers to keep\nthe work flow going so that we can maintain stability\nin the centers. The object is to give the American\npublic a space program that allows us to leave planet\n\n147\n\n1 ITH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nEarth and to give the next generation of students in\nthis world a future of opportunity.\nThis is the direction\nwe\'re going in.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2..we\n\nare not downsizing\n\nbringing\n\nNASA. We are\n\nNASA into the 21st century.\n\nFinally, NASA is not a place where we have 70\npercent of the budget in operations related to facility\nmaintenance.\nIt\'s not a place where we should have\npeople working on printing the circuit boards in the\nmiddle of the night on custom hardware when we\nshould just go buy computers\noff the shelf. When the\ncomputer breaks down, bring the maintenance\norganization into NASA.\nThis is what we\'re doing. Don\'t be afraid. Let me\ntell you, there are companies that downsize and there\nare companies that look into the future. The companies\nthat downsize get to the place that they deserve. The\ncompanies that look about going into the future will\ncreate new opportunities.\nDon\'t be so afraid. People complained about\nchange at NASA for almost a decade. Now that it\'s\nhere, they\'re holding on to the past with an iron fist.\nDon\'t hold on to the past. Don\'t be afraid. It will be\nO.K.\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you. Mr. Chen, a question for\nyou. What do you feel China can best contribute to the\nSpace Station effort, and I\'il expand that to include\ninternational\nspace cooperation\nand the civil space area\nitself?.\nCHEN:\nWe are grateful to have the great encouragement from the international\nspace community.\nWe\nwill be very happy and excited when we see the Chinese astronauts flying in orbit.\nLast night I had a talk with my friends from\nMcDonnell Douglas at their exhibition booth. They\nsaid, one day, sooner or later, China will join in the\nInternational\nSpace Station project. I think that is our\nhope. We will be very happy to contribute to the Station like the other countries.\nI recently participated\nin the preparation\nfor the\nsigning of the MOU between China and Canada. I was\ntold by my Canadian friends that they play an important role in the Space Station with their Canadian arm\nand other technologies.\nIn general, we hope to have friendly cooperation\nin the space arena with other countries and corporations. Specifically to the Station, I think our technologies in recovering\npayloads and in tracking, telemetry,\nand control are quite good. When the right time comes, we can have further discussions.\nMR.\n\n148\n\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you. Mr. Dor6, what is the age\nlimit for your students? Do you train other than young\nstudents? And what does the one year master\'s program cost?\nMR. DORI_: At the Summer School last summer in\nBarcelona, we had 126 students. The average age was\n28. For the master, the average age will be feasibly a\nlittle higher, most likely around 30 because most of\nthese people are already in the space sector and they\nwill enter the program with high academic qualifications and a few years of practical experience.\nUnfortunately, I don\'t have the exact statistics for \'95.\nIn terms of cost, the tuition fee is $23,000 U.S.\nfor tuition, only for the master. The Summer School\nfee is $13,000 at present. It includes, for the Summer\nSchool, the food and lodging; for the master it does\nnot. You must understand\nwe are a private university\nthat is not being subsidized by any government,\nbecause then we would lose our independence.\nWe want\nto keep that independence\nbecause this a crucial factor\ntowards the success of ISU. Therefore,\nthe tuition is\nsimilar to that of other private universities\naround the\nworld.\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you. Lon, when you say that the\naverage man/woman\nis "shut out," what do you mean,\nand how can we make space more relevant to the\naverage U.S. taxpayer?\nMR. RAINS: I think the first thing I mean is that the\naverage man and woman wants to go to space. They\ndon\'t want to wait. They don\'t want to be voyeurs,\nthey want to go and I think that, to the greatest degree\nthat we can develop systems that will allow that to\nhappen and start moving in that direction, you\'ll see\ngreater public support.\nDR. DAILEY: Mr. Goldin,\non that at all?\nMR.\nsaid,\ndant\nhave\n\nwould you like to comment\n\nGOLDIN: I think the key is as Tom Rogers has\n"You have to get low-cost, safe, reliable, abunaccess to space." This is absolutely the key. We\ngot to move as fast as possible.\nWe have a real problem. Every time we get close\nto the mark, all those interested in maintaining the\nstatus quo fight real hard to prevent it. This is an open\nbook quiz for America as to whether or not we\'re\ngoing to make this RLV work, whether we\'ll get the\nfunding we need, whether we\'ll trickle fund it or\nwhether we\'ll fund it robustly, whether industry will\nstep up and really try or whether industry will try and\nmaintain the EELV fleet and pay lip service to the\nRLV. There are a whole bunch of conflicting forces\nhere, and as the administrator\nof NASA, I have an\nobligation to the American people to make sure this\ngoes forward. I\'m going to do everything I can. From\n\nTHE\n\nthe standpoint of NASA, there is no higher\nnew start. As I testified in the Congress, if\nmore cutting of the NASA budget, we will\nexisting programs.\nBut this will be the last.\ngoing to stop.\n\npriority\nthere\'s any\ncancel\nWe\'re\n\nDR. DAILEY: Mr. Goldin, EOS appears headed toward another restructuring\nfor smaller spacecraft size.\nWhen do you envision a right-size spacecraft so we\nbegin building beyond AM-l?\nMR. GOLDIN: Let me say this. We have taken EOS\nfrom $17 billion for this decade down to $7.3 billion\nfor this decade. It would have been nice to have done\nit in an environment\nwhere people really recognize we\nowe the American public some money, but there was\nquite a bit of resistance every time we went to change\nthe EOS program. So instead of doing so gracefully,\nwe\'re doing it in a few fits and starts.\nThe problem we have is this: if you take a look at\nthe EOS program and say we have three phases to it,\none is to the end of this decade--maybe\nuntil 2003-where we launch 24 instruments and they operate for\nat least five years. Then phase two is another 24 instruments for five years, and phase three is another 24\ninstruments for five years. The tradition in America is\nfirst, when you develop something,\nthe contractor gets\nthe contract and they have a multi-decadeal\ncontract.\nWe do not want to do that with EOS because we projected the outyear funding and we built up a program\nthat was bigger than Space Station. You project it out\nover the 15-year timeframe.\nSo we said, we\'re going to get the first EOS platforms launched and we\'re going to look closely at\ndeveloping technology\nbetween now and 2000 that will\nlet us get away from these medium-sized\nspacecraft\nand go to individual spacecraft. The object is to have\none instrument per spacecraft, and see if we can coregister the pixels from these instruments.\nWe intend to run experiments\nin the next few\nyears, not the next few decades, to prove this. And if\nwe prove this is the case, the very minute we prove\nit\'s the case, we\'re going to start flying these. The\nother nice part about having one instrument and one\nspacecraft is the fact that, with this new technology,\nyou could continually upgrade. You wouldn\'t get\nlocked in to old technology and have the space program become an organic program sustained to protect\nthe jobs of today.\nThe other nice feature of being able to do this is\nthat there will be some fraction of these instruments\nthat will be commercially\ninteresting and viable. Instead of NASA having to go out and do things, the\ncommercial\nindustries will say, "Hey, why don\'t you\nbecome an active tenant, buy some data from us, we\'ll\ntake care of everything."\nWe\'ll be pleased to do that\nand ultimately just turn the whole thing over to the\ncommercial\nsector.\n\nWORLD\n\nIS INTO\n\nSPACE\n\nWe would like to see the remote sensing business\ngo from $1 billion a year to $10 billion a year. It will\nnever go to $10 billion a year if we award a prime\ncontract on the common spacecraft buy and allow that\nto go for 15 or 20 years. We are going to get this\nthing going. I have no sympathy for maintaining\nstability. We\'re going to have the most advanced program in the world. We\'ll make the basic measurements; we\'re going to meet our obligations\nfor the\nnext five years. It\'ll take time to transition,\nbut at the\nturn of the century, I\'d like to see Darwin rule EOS.\n\nWe have a real problem.\n\nEvery time we get\n\nclose to the mark, all those interested\nmaintaining\n\nin\n\nthe status quo fight real hard to\nprevent\n\nit.\n\nDR. DAILEY: Another one for Mr. Goldin. How can\nyou say we are making progress on space when we\ncannot land humans on the moon as we were able to\n25 years ago?\nMR. GOLDIN: The object of going into space is not to\ngo back to the moon and land humans again--to\ndo\nwhat we\'ve already done. I am not so sure that it\'s\nnecessary to go back to the moon, but we need to\nexplore that. We need to keep in mind the vision I just\noutlined.\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you. Dr. Dor6, I\'d like to ask\nyou a question with respect to the students you educate. As the moderator\'s\nprerogative,\nI think I\'il pursue this line of questioning.\nThe students really provide us with insights as to what they see the troubles\nare in the space program. Sometimes we often ignore\nthem or don\'t really take notice of them. What are\nsome of the items that are on the students\' minds or\nthe issues that are on their minds that concern them\nabout the direction of the U.S. space program, and\nwhat kind of recommendations\ndo they make, if any,\nin seeing how they could make it even more looked at\nas an important program for society?\nDR. DORI_: I don\'t think I\'m in a position to really\nanswer your question, because I did not, myself, participate in the past summer schools. The only thing I\ncan say is that, from what I\'ve seen in terms of reports, for example, for the space policies of the world\nand national space policies, is that in the environment\nof the summer school, they come up with ideas that\nare not bound to the constraints\nwe usually work with.\nAnd it produces, sometimes,\nsolutions that make a lot\nof sense, because in the process they were not bound\n\n149\n\nI ITH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nby such constraints.\nThat\'s\ndon\'t have the answer.\n\na very good question,\n\nbut I\n\nDR. DAILEY: O.K. Mr. Rains, you have published a\nnumber of times in your newspaper some public opinion polls about what the Americans think of the U.S.\nspace program. What are the kinds of things--to\nkind\nof elaborate on this issue--how\ndoes the United States\nand even others see the space program and its value?\nWhat are some of the recommendations\nthat you would\nmake that really aren\'t involved inside the beltway\ndiscussions but are really on the minds of Americans\nabout where the space program\'s\ngoing and the problems it may have?\n\nI don\'t know why there\'s\nemotion\n\nabout canceling\n\nsuch passion\n\nand\n\nMedlite. We are\n\ngoing to go to Mars in \'98 and 2001, 2003. We\nwanted a launch vehicle\nthe spacecraft\n\nthat could get us half\n\nthere for half the cost. And\n\nthat\'s what we did when we went out with the\nMedlite procurement.\n\nMR. RAINS: I don\'t think it really is on the mind of\nAmericans.\nI think the Americans like it; I think to\nsome degree it is voyeuristic.\nThere\'s entertainment\nvalue. There is certainly educational\nvalue. But I don\'t\nthink it\'s a burning issue with the voters or with the\npublic. As I\'ve said, I think that the way that\'s going\nto happen is when people see that it is something for\nthem and not just something for scientists or pilots or\na very exclusive group of people. The people like the\nspace program, but it\'s not a burning issue with the\npublic at all.\nDR. DAILEV: We have time for a couple more questions. Mr. Goldin, with NASA\'s charter in RLVs, will\nMedlite be canceled?\nMR. GOLDIN: I don\'t know why there\'s such passion\nand emotion about canceling Medlite. We are going to\ngo to Mars in \'98 and 2001, 2003. We wanted a\nlaunch vehicle that could get us half the spacecraft\nthere for half the cost. And that\'s what we did when\nwe went out with the Medlite procurement.\nWhat\'s been going on behind the scenes in trying\nto get that procurement\ncanceled absolutely baffles me.\nWe are going to use it. We awarded a contract that\nwas bid competitively,\nand so long as it performs and\nwe don\'t have anything better, we will use it.\n\n150\n\nDR. DAILEV: Finally, Mr. Johns, would you elaborate on the changes in the NASA organization\nthat you\nwould propose in the future to make it more efficient?\nLike, give us from the White House perspective.\nJOHNS:\nDan Goldin will be pleased to hear that\nthe White House has no intention of micromanaging\nNASA. We are supportive of the notion that NASA\nhas to modernize.\nIt has a job to do and a new agenda,\nand the American people have indicated they would\nlike to have government\ncost as little as it possibly\ncan. That message has put some urgency into trying to\ndo this as economically\nas possible. We think Dan\'s\non the right track.\nMR.\n\nDR. DAILEY: Thank you. I want to thank the audience for their patience. I think this is a very important\nsymposium.\nInternationalization\nof space is clearly a\nfuture direction and will continue to be a future direction for the nation. I\'d also like to thank Dave Payne\nfor putting this all together and making sure it runs on\ntime like a Swiss clock.\nAgain, thanks all of you for coming, and we look\nforward to seeing you tonight. Thank you.\nMR. PAYNE: I\'d like to thank the session speakers,\nparticularly\nour friends who have come from far away,\nand especially our keynote speaker, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin. And a special thanks to Brian\nDailey for moderating this session.\nWe do have a short video from ITr Aerospace\nCommunication\nDivision to show you their dynamic\ncompany. That will be followed by the reception,\nwhich is also sponsored by ITI" Aerospace Communication Division. That will be in the Colorado Hall.\nSo if we can go ahead and start that video, please.\n\nSPACE\n\nSpace\nFeatured\nSpeaker:\n\nTechnology\n\nHall\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nHALL\n\nOF\n\nFAME\n\nof Fame\n\nC. Michael Armstrong\nChairman & CEO\nHughes Electronics\nCorporation\n\nGeneral James E. Hill, Dick MacLeod. The\nlegendary Dr. Teller. Dignitaries from Space\nCommand and the Air Force Academy.\nAnd in the\nspace of this, the 1lth annual National Space\nSymposium,\nnone of us can underestimate\nthe\nimportance\nof this gathering as an intellectual\nintersection to face change and exchange ideas. To my\nmind, there\'s no better proof than the fact that this\nsymposium unites people from every comer of the\nspace community:\ncivil and military, U.S. and\ninternational.\nAnd this symposium is all the more important\nnow, because we meet at a time of maximum\nuncertainty--an\nidea that is really inherent in this\nyear\'s theme, "Vision and Reality:\nFace to Face."\nIn\nthat theme, there\'s a sense of an industry at a crossroads--if\nnot at cross-purposes.\nAnd that\'s\nunderstandable.\nI think we all know that our approach\nto space, an approach catalyzed by the Cold War, has\nchanged--has\nto change--if\nwe are to realize our new\nfuture in space.\n\nIf some of the mystique\nonce surrounded\n\nour space efforts\n\nof the past, it\'s because\nspace efforts\n\nand mystery\n\nthat\n\nis a thing\n\nthe reality of our\n\nhas become more routine.\n\nBut my purpose tonight is not to deliver a requiem\nfor the Space Revolution.\nAnyone who is tempted to\nsend flowers fails to see the window of opportunity\nnow open to us.\nI\'ll admit, that\'s not quite what we might see out\nour window right now. This week we\'ve heard the\ngeneral prognosis:\nA challenging forecast for\ngovernment\nspace programs and hopeful prospects for\nthe commercial\nspace sector.\nIn Washington\nthese days it seems there\'s a continuing hit list with DoD or NASA\'s name on it. The\nlandscape is littered with programs that are being\nstretched out, consolidated,\nor killed altogether.\nBut there are programs that each of us, if not all\nof us, should fight for--programs\nlike EOS/DIS, an\nintegral part of the Mission to Planet Earth. From\ntheir position in polar-orbit,\nEOS satellites will beam\nback a steady stream of data on our Earth, our\natmosphere,\nand our oceans; information\navailable to\nscientists not just here in the U.S., but also around the\nworld. It\'s a sound example of the way our journey\ninto space is an exploration into our own world, our\ndestiny, and ourselves.\n\nBut the fact is, programs that were once\nsacrosanct are being caught in the cross-hairs.\nThe\nsharp decline from the peak space budget is even\nsteeper than the decline we\'ve seen in defense. Space,\nas far as the budget battle is concerned,\nis now a\ntarget rather than a societal imperative.\nNow, if all of this implies a kind of glass\nhalf-empty assessment,\nthat is not what I mean to\nsuggest.\n\nWe learned some time ago that technology\nspace can secure\n\nin\n\npeace on this earth. We\'re\n\nlearning now that space is a gateway\nsimply to peace, but to prosperity\n\nnot\n\nas well.\n\nIf some of the mystique and mystery that once\nsurrounded\nour space efforts is a thing of the past, it\'s\nbecause the reality of our space efforts has become\nmore routine. That\'s true--whether\nwe\'re a\nbusinessperson\ncommunicating\naway from home, or\nan army on the move.\nTake our experience in Desert Storm. Consider\nthe daring end-run through the Iraqi desert that won\nthe ground war--and\nthe technology that made it\npossible.\nI\'m talking about GPS. The desert is the\nclosest thing our planet offers to a lunar landscape,\nwith almost featureless terrain and few fixed points.\nU.S. forces and their coalition partners could never\nhave executed that kind of ground attack--the\nswinging door that slammed shut on Saddam\'s\nfront-line forces--without\ncontrolling the high ground\nof space.\nWe learned some time ago that technology in\nspace can secure peace on this earth. We\'re learning\nnow that space is a gateway not simply to peace, but\nto prosperity\nas well.\nWe all know the fall of the Berlin Wall was the\nlast gasp of communist ideology. But it was something\nmore as well: It was a victory for a communications\nrevolution whose full effects are only now beginning\nto register--and\nreverberate--through\nour world.\nFrom the cave wall, to the log drum, to the twisted pair, to the signals that arc across the vastness of\nspace, we have always sought a better means to speak\nour mind, to share our ideas, to advance our thoughts.\nBut just as the Cold War and the quest for the\nmilitary high ground sparked the race for space, so,\ntoo, it took the end of the Cold War to clear the way\nfor the true commercialization\nof space.\n\n151\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nEvery day, we see the consumerization\nof space\nbecoming a reality. The GPS system I mentioned a\nmoment ago in regard to Desert Storm: Last month\nour Deice Electronics\nbusiness unveiled its new,\nlow-cost Telepath in-car navigation system. Its an\nin-the-dash integrated approach with street matching\nand directional guidance, and even an electronic Yellow Pages, made possible by the same GPS satellites.\nI submit that the commercialization\nof space, the\ncommunications\nrevolution,\nand the globalization\nof\nmarkets go hand in hand.\n\nWithout\n\nbeating around the bush, the reason\n\nI\'m enthusiastic\nspace is becoming\nbusiness.\nindustry\n\nabout the future is that\na competitive\n\nAnd it\'s because\n\nis driving significant\n\nlivering\n\nbreak-through\n\ndramatically\ndifference\n\nimproving\n\nplace to do\nthe space\n\nchange--de-\n\ntechnology\n\nand\n\nperformance.\n\nThe\n\ntoday is that it\'s getting\n\nall this\n\ndone with costs that are affordable\n\nto the\n\ninvestor,\n\nprices that are competitive\n\nmarket, and returns\n\nthat are attractive\n\nto the\nto the\n\nshareholder.\n\nEvery day we see new evidence that Space is the\nnew media for modem life. At Hughes, in recognition\nof this reality, we\'ve set our sites on a vision we call\nthe Wireless Expressway.\nIn contrast to the images of\nan Information\nSuperhighway\nstitched together by\ncable and wire, we are constructing\nan "instant\ninfrastructure"--a\nportfolio of space-based\nsystems,\nthat, once deployed, put whole countries and\ncontinents on- line. Not only on-line instantly for\neveryone, every place they beam, but also delivering a\nubiquitous,\naffordable service to those that need as\nwell as to those that have. Telephony\nwhere telephones haven\'t begun; communications\nmobility\nwhere wires cannot serve; bandwidth-on-demand\nwhere distance learning, teleconferencing,\nand telemedicine make a difference in our society and\nbetween our societies.\nWe tend to believe that the shortest distance\nbetween vision and reality is often a satellite in orbit.\nAs we implement this vision, the once-sharp\nline\nbetween civilian and military use of space has become\nblurred. Imagine the mobile cities of people we call\nmodem armies, the floating cities we call carriers, and\nthe air assets that project power around the globe.\nImagine the use they could make of this instant\ninformation\ninfrastructure.\nWe have a significant\nopportunity\nto exploit new synergies in space\ntechnology--an\nopportunity\nwith profound impact for\n152\n\nboth peace and prosperity.\nBut there will be no reality to this vision unless\nwe do execute Dan Goldin\'s challenge:\nfaster, cheaper, better. In fact, this challenge is the very\nunderpinning\nof applying space assets to new\napplications,\nboth for commercial\nand government\nmarkets. The key..,\nis affordability.\nThe laws of\neconomics work every bit as much in a gravity-free\nenvironment\nas they do on Earth: Affordability\nopens\nthe door to market acceptance and demand elasticity.\nWithout beating around the bush, the reason I\'m\nenthusiastic\nabout the future is that space is becoming\na competitive\nplace to do business. And it\'s because\nthe space industry is driving significant change--delivering break-through\ntechnology and dramatically\nimproving performance.\nThe difference today is that\nit\'s getting all this done with costs that are affordable\nto the investor, prices that are competitive\nto the\nmarket, and returns that are attractive to the\nshareholder.\nWe see proof of this in the power, payload, propulsion, and performance\nof today\'s satellite\ntechnology.\nIn payload power, there\'s been a four-fold\nincrease in less than 10 years, and we\'re confident\nwe\'ll see an additional two-fold-plus\nincrease within\nthe decade ahead.\nIn payload capacity, we now deliver multiple\npayloads for C-, Ku-, and L-bands--capacity\nthat\npermits a single satellite to offer multiple applications\nfrom broadcast to mobile communications\nto personal\nnetworks.\nIn propulsion,\nour new Xips (pronounced\nZips)\nion propulsion system, scheduled for launch later this\nyear, will reduce the weight of the system while increasing the life of the satellite. Xips brings the\nweight of our 601 satellite down by 800 pounds--a\nsavings of $10 million dollars per launch. This gives\nthe customer the right kind of flexibility:\nTake the\nweight reduction to lower cost, or hold the cost\nconstant and add capacity.\nAnd in performance,\nfor the 100-plus communications\nsatellites we\'ve launched since 1963,\nHughes\' transponder\nchannel availability exceeds 99.4\npercent. A terrific customer service record that\'s only\ngoing to get better.\nThe trajectory of these technological\nadvances is\ncritical, because when it comes to new government\napplications,\nour commercial\nspace effort can offer\nimportant lessons learned. Part of it is just due to the\nnature of the market system. On the commercial\nside,\nwe live on a diet of fixed price contracts. We\'ve got\nto be competitive\non a month-to-month,\nday-by-day\nbasis: We can\'t expect to win a few platforms and\nlive off of them for years.\nIn a commercial\ncompetition,\nthe norm is two to\nthree month\'s compete time, with launch 18 to 24\nmonths later. Cycle times are short and growing shorter, and the distance between technology\ndevelopment\n\nSPACE\n\nand manufacturing\nis closing fast. These trends mean\nbottom line--faster,\ncheaper, better.\nNot only is technology making this a reality,\nmarkets are converging\nand also making it a reality.\nTraditionally,\ngovernment\nsought and bought technology-state\nof the art, with performance\nthe\npriority. The commercial\nsector, in contrast, often\nsought economy, but only as much technology as the\ncustomer wanted and could pay for. Today, both\nmarkets are cost-driven, just as both of their\ncustomers clamor for new technology.\nTraditionally,\nwe have looked for dual use opportunities,\nand we should. But today, it\'s a two-way\nstreet, where we also find commercial\nfeedback into\ndefense systems. We used to speak about spin-offs;\nwe now see spin-backs.\nNot just the modern\nequivalents of Teflon and Tang, but technologies\nat\nthe cutting-edge of change. Technologies\nthat can\nboost morale, win wars, save lives.\nTake Hughes" Spaceway system, for example.\nThis will be an interactive,\nglobal satellite network\nthat will offer high-speed\nvoice, video, and data\ntransmission\nup to 150 times faster than conventional\ntelephony. As just one measure of what Spaceway will\ndo, consider telemedicine\nand the transmission\nof\ndigitized X-rays. Right now, sending an X-ray over\nthe phone line takes an average of 21 minutes. Spaceway will take that transmit time down to 8 seconds.\nBut my point is this: We didn\'t depend on\ngovernment\ndollars to get Spaceway started. We\'ve\ntaken the pulse of the marketplace\nand see the need\nfor a commercial version of the Milstar system the\ngovernment\nspent 10 years to put in place.\nAnd when Spaceway is up and running in 1998,\nwe anticipate the military will literally lease space as\nneeded. No upfront cost. No 10-year wait. No\ndeployment\nof scarce resources long before you need\nthe service. That\'s the beauty of Spaceway\'s bandwidth-on-demand.\nWe see the same opportunities\ntoday with\nDirecTV, our satellite-based\n150 channels of TV to an\n18-inch dish. Last November I had the honor of\nvisiting the USS Abraham Lincoln to inaugurate our\nfirst ship-based DirecTV system. Now, we\'re working\nwith the Navy to bring that service to every ship in\nthe fleet.\nYes, having DirecTV on board means watching\nthe Lakers play the Nuggets live without having to\nwait for Morn or Dad to mail out a videotape. And\nthat matters; it matters because morale is a key to\nmilitary preparedness.\nBut the shipboard telecommunications\nlink I\'m\ntalking about is important in ways that go well beyond\nits entertainment\nvalue. Look at the capabilities for\ndistance learning:\nConnecting\ninstructors and trainers\nto crew members by television. Look at the capability\nfor telemedicine:\nWhat happens when a service\nmember falls ill or is injured at base or in battle? In\nthose first few hours when medical treatment is\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nHALL OF FAME\n\ncritical, it\'s faster, it\'s easier, and it may save more\nlives to beam a specialist in from Walter Reed than to\nget a sick service member to the specialist. With\n63,000 patients airvac\'d a year, this technology should\nmake a difference.\nI\'ve used the Navy to illustrate the kind of new\napplications\nDirecTV makes possible:\nBut it should\nbe clear that this technology promises benefits to the\nforces of every service in many circumstances.\nIt all starts with asking questions. If we can get\n150 channels of bandwidth on our television, what can\nwe do with 150 channels in a tank? How about in a\ntent, or my truck, or a foxhole, or in the cockpit?\nGiven the convergence\nof space technologies,\ngiven commercialization\'s\nimpact on costs, space is a\ncompetitive\nplace to do business today, whether we\nare multiplying\nforce structure, or serving market\nforces.\n\nBut the comprehensive\n\nchange\n\nneeded cannot come from industry\n\nthat is\nalone. We\n\nmust see a parallel shift in space policy from\nthe halls of Congress\nPentagon\n\nto the E Ring of the\n\nto Foggy Bottom\n\nand NASA.\n\nUp to now, I\'ve spoken about the way the market\nis driving change, and the way industry is responding.\nBut the comprehensive\nchange that is needed cannot\ncome from industry alone. We must see a parallel\nshift in space policy from the halls of Congress to the\nE Ring of the Pentagon to Foggy Bottom and NASA.\nFirst, I\'d like to challenge our customers,\nNASA and\nthe JCS, to accelerate realizing the commercial\nspace\npotential.\nNASA is looking at outsourcing\nand importing\ncommercial\npractices. The JCS are looking at jointly\nbuilding information\nand communications\nsystems and\nusing the commercial\nmarket to help get that done.\nThese are positive changes, changes I applaud, and I\nassure you industry will support.\nSecond, the Cold War may be over, but too many\nof the old policies live on. For example, we must end\nthe U.S. Cold War practice of unilateral economic\nsanctions. The annals of history do not provide a\nsingle example where unilateral economic sanctions\nworked. In most cases, the target country finds a way\nto get the technology,\nand third-country\nindustry,\nunaffected by sanctions, gets the sale. That\'s what\nwe\'ve seen in the State Department\'s\nsanctions against\ncommercial communications\nsatellites launched in\nChina.\nCommercial\ncommunications\nsatellites should not\nbe on the munitions list. They are irrelevant to missile\nproliferation\nor threat of technology transfer.\nIncluding them on the munitions list simply costs us\n153\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nexports and jobs. State Department sanctions are the\nmost significant competitive\nadvantage our European\nsatellite competitors\npossess. It\'s a policy that must be\naddressed if the American aerospace industry is to\ncontinue to globally compete.\nAnd third, we\'ve got to make our voice heard and\nour views known as Washington\nrewrites\ntelecommunications\npolicy. This may not sound like\nan issue for many in the audience today, but it\'s part\nof the post Cold-War changes I\'m talking about.\nPhone, cable, and fiber are all weighing in on this\ndebate: We need to make certain wireless technologies are fairly considered as the new rules for the\nInformation\nSuperhighway\nare written.\nIn the area of video distribution,\nwe must ensure\ncontinued equal access to programming.\nWithout equal\naccess, there can be no competitive distribution\nsystem. Vertical integration of the industry would\nquickly prevail, a few mega-companies\nwould rule,\nand chaos at the consumer level would result.\nAlso, as the FCC and Congress try to define just\nwhat is "effective competition"\nin the cable industry,\nas they consider deregulation,\nI would urge them also\nto address the networks,\nwhich everyone seems to\nagree should continue to be regulated. If cable\ncompanies are going to be permitted to package and\nprice upper-tier programming\non an unregulated\nbasis,\nthen for satellite and telephony to be competitive,\nthe\nnetworks should be offered on a regulated, stand-alone\nprice basis.\nAnd finally, while the PCS spectrum auction was\nappropriate\nand successful for local licensees, a\nsimilar approach to spectrum that is satellite-based\nand/or international\nin scope would be a disaster for\nthe U.S. commercial\nsatellite industry. Not only\nwould we have an unfair tax, versus terrestrial\ntechnology,\nbut it would provoke an international\nspace trade war that would decrease the\ncommercialization\nof space and limit international\nmarket access.\nI am encouraged\nthat the FCC and Congresspeople\nI talk to are supportive on these issues, but until legislation or regulations\nare determined,\nwe must speak\nout and secure fair and equitable policy.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nmy message tonight is quite\nstraightforward.\nWe have an exciting and rewarding\nfuture as we make space a competitive\nplace to do\nbusiness. And as we deliver faster, cheaper, better,\nwe need to\n\xe2\x80\xa2 accelerate commercial\napplication to public and\nmilitary use,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ensure technology transfer is a two-way street,\nand\n\xe2\x80\xa2 stand up for the changes in telecommunications\nderegulation that results in fair and balanced policy.\nIt\'s been more than 20 years since Neil Armstrong\ntook one giant step for mankind. There were times\nsince then when we may have lost our sense of\nmission that motivated the space program. As\n154\n\nparadoxical as it may seem, we are regaining our\nsense of excitement and energy about the potential of\nspace. Space is still the high ground--a\nnew frontier\nwhere we explore a world far beyond our own, a\njourney that ultimately brings us back to ourselves.\nI believe we are poised to take another giant step\ninto a space-based future that brings us peace and\nprosperity for years to come. Thank you.\n\nTHE\n\nThe Outlook\nFeatured\nSpeaker:\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nFOR\n\nSPACE\n\nfor Space\n\nGeneral Ronald R. Fogleman\nChief of Staff, U.S. Air Force\n\nSpace - Our Foundation\n\nfor\n\nToday and Tomorrow\n\nIt\'s a real privilege to be back in Colorado\nSprings. I\'ve done two tours here, and still I find this\nan\' exciting place. One of the things that has always\nimpressed me is the history of this city. It is filled\nwith all kinds of stories about pioneers, like Zebulon\nPike, who came here in 1806. There\'s also General\nWilliam Palmer who developed this city in 1871.\nAnd, as I look around this room, I recognize that\nI am in the presence of living pioneers. I see General\n[Bernard] Schriever and others who have been real\npioneers in space. We are not in a situation where the\npioneering era is behind us. I think we\'re in midstride. And, we\'re advancing not just this nation\'s, but\nmankind\'s interests in what lies beyond the earth\'s\natmosphere.\nSo, I am very honored that General Jim\nHill invited me.\nI do want to tell you one thing up front. When I\ngot involved in the programming\nbusiness in the early\n1980s, I kept running into the space portion of our\nbudget. Obviously, at the time, I didn\'t know much\nabout it. There was a young colonel in the building at\nthe time by the name of Tom Moorman. He came to\nmy help and started giving me lessons--space\n101,\n102, and field trips. As a result of that, I became a\nsupporter of space programs.\nI don\'t say that to be\ncondescending.\nBut, I mention it because I had the\nopportunity\nto see, in the beginning,\nthe promise for\nmuch of what has now come to fruition.\nSecretary Widnall has shared the status of our\nspace initiatives with you, so I won\'t go into those\ndetails again. The thing I would like to talk about,\nthough, is something the Air Force is doing that I am\nvery proud of. To appreciate what I\'m talking about, I\nneed to put it in perspective.\nIt starts with the fact that our defense budget is\ndown. That\'s no surprise. And, for the Air Force, our\nmodernization\naccount has fallen something like 60\npercent over the past decade. You know what that\nmeans. There\'s great competition for dollars in the\nbudget. As the chief of staff, I spend my time trying\nto balance what these dollars buy for near-term readiness, force structure, and modernization.\nWe have this\ncompelling\ninterest to maintain readiness. And, certainly, we must maintain our force structure. But, I\nwill also tell you that we must modernize for tomorrow.\nBut, despite the decline in our modernization\naccount, the Air Force has two new acquisition programs in our current budget. Both involve space programs. I am, personally and professionally,\nvery\nproud of this. The evolved expendable launch vehicle\nand the space-based\ninfrared system are critical for\n\nthis nation to maintain our edge in space. I am very\noptimistic that these initiatives will be model programs. I say this for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, we are building a foundation of trust and\nteamwork--a\nshared confidence with industry. I will\ntell you that Secretary Widnall and I view industry as\nfull partners on the Air Force team. We recognize the\nneed to take bold and innovative proposals to make\nEELV and SBIR systems a reality. Your commercial\nand civil ventures give you tremendous\nexpertise and\nknowledge.\nYou don\'t need us telling you how to\nbuild a better mouse trap or a better spacecraft.\nSo,\nwhat we are going to do in these programs--and\nacross our procurement\nprograms--is\ntell you what we\nneed and let you figure out how best to build it. I see\nit as a cooperative\neffort. I think it\'s the right approach.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.. despite the decline in our modernization\naccount,\nacquisition\n\nthe Air Force has two new\nprograms\n\nin our current budget.\n\nBoth involve space programs.\n\nAs a historian, when I look back on the history of\nthis nation, we have been successful and on the leading edge of any activity when government\nand industry worked in a cooperative,\nnot confrontational\nmanner. So, viewing industry as a trusted partner on the\nAir Force team is a major initiative on my watch.\nSecond, we are serious about reducing the cost of\ndoing business with the Air Force. We are doing this\nseveral ways, but I will mention just two efforts.\nCertainly, as I have traveled around and talked to the\nleaders of various industries,\nit has become clear to\nme that we have too much oversight. In some cases,\nwe have too many people who just drop in to visit.\nAll of this drives a certain amount of overhead and\nadministrative\ncosts. In one case, a CEO told me that\nat his complex, he had over 12,000 visitors in one\nyear. Now, I\'ve got to tell you, we were not doing\nenough business with that individual to generate\n12,000 visitors in one year. This is an example of us\nhaving too many visitors. If we\'re going to be serious\nabout reducing costs, we\'ve got to get out of the tourist business.\nSo, if you have too many Air Force folks just\ndropping in, let me know. I know how to solve this\nproblem. As an old programmer,\nI know that if you\ncontrol their dollars, you control their hearts and\nminds. We\'re going to work this issue.\n\n155\n\n11TH\n\nNATIONAL\n\nSPACE\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nSecond, we\'re streamlining\nthe procurement process itself. I think the EELV is a good example.\nWe\'re looking at operating in a paperless environment. You sit there and think, "Geez General, it\'s\nabout time you guys started thinking this way. We\'ve\nbeen doing this for some time." And, I think we\'re\nfinally getting the clue. We\'ve done this most recently\nwith our JAST program--the\nJoint Advanced Strike\nTechnology program that we are doing with the Navy.\nI\'d like to give you an update of how the JAST program is moving forward, to save time and money.\nIn February of 1994, the JAST office issued a\nrequest for concept exploration studies. It was a first\nstep in designing an aircraft. To speed up that process, they required all contractors\nto submit proposals\nelectronically.\nAnd they received 154 separate proposals. Using the old methods, the JAST program office\ncalculated that it would have needed 13 weeks to\nevaluate the proposals.\nIt would have employed four\nclerks, and it would have had to find a way to store\nover 130,000 pages of documentation.\n\nThe bottom\n\nline is that the paperless process\n\nis faster, it is more responsive\n\nto new ideas,\n\nand it costs less.\n\nBut, by using the electronic medium, the JAST\nprogram awarded the contract in two weeks, employed\none clerk, and used no paper at all. The entire process--from\nconcept to contract--took\nonly four\nmonths. Now, if it had used the established methods,\nit would have taken over a year. When you crunch the\nnumbers, you\'ll see that the paperless process reduced\nthe time required by 60 percent. What I have discovered in talking with industry CEOs is that time is money, because time multiplied by people is dollars.\nAnd, if we are doing business with you, we\'re paying\nfor that time and these people. The bottom line is that\nthe paperless process is faster, it is more responsive to\nnew ideas, and it costs less.\nSo, my point is that we\'re trying to make strides\nin our procurement\npractices. And we need to. Particularly, I think, in the space business. As I told you a\nmoment ago, I am great supporter of our space programs. And, if we are to sustain our space operations\nand leadership,\nwe\'ve got to modernize our space\nforces. At the same time, we\'ve got to be able to do it\nin an efficient and prudent manner. This is important,\nnot just to the United States Air Force, but to the\nnation as a whole. Let me explain why.\nWhen the Berlin Wall came down, we found ourselves in a situation where the nation needed to change\nits national security strategy. It was here, in Colorado,\non the second of August, 1990, that President Bush\nenunciated a new security strategy. This strategy reduced our overseas basing. We would maintain\n156\n\nenough forward presence to facilitate the introduction\nof troops if we needed to come to the aid of allies, to\nprovide humanitarian\nassistance, or to defend a vital\nU.S. interest. At the same time, we would build a\ncontinental-based\ncontingency force. As a result, this\nstrategy created new demands. It put an increased\nemphasis, in my view, on space architecture\nand space\nforces. These forces allow us to remain engaged\nworldwide,\neveryday. Our space-based\nassets give this\nnation a degree of global situational awareness that no\nother nation has. As such, I see these assets providing\nour nation a unique form of global presence from the\nhigh ground of space. We monitor events and provide\ntimely information--24\nhours a day, anywhere in the\nworld.\nIt hasn\'t always been that way. In one sense, I\nlook back and think I have had a very short career. In\nanother sense, due to the particular\ntime frame that\nthis 31 years has spanned, I\'ve seen a tremendous\nchange. In the early "60s, when I was first commissioned, space was an arena dedicated to research and\ndevelopment.\nThen, by the early \'70s, when I was on\nmy second trip into Southeast Asia, I saw how satellites started, in a very rudimentary\nway, to support the\nwarfighter.\nPrimarily,\nthey provided weather data. By\nthe end of the \'70s, our space assets were becoming\ncritical to mission planning and communications.\nThey\nplayed a part in the failed Iranian rescue attempt. As\nwe entered the \'80s, space forces gave us a much\nbroader global situational awareness.\nFor example,\nspace permitted us to monitor the Iran-lraq conflict.\nWe gained a lot of valuable information\nin this manner. And then, of course, as everyone knows, Desert\nStorm was the place where space and terrestrial forces\nwere highly integrated for the first time.\n\nOur space-based\n\nassets give this nation a\n\ndegree of global situational\n\nawareness\n\nthat\n\nno other nation has.\n\nDesert Storm was interesting.\nI have a lot of personal experience,\nnot in the desert, but as the air\ncomponent commander\nin Korea at the time. I sat\nthere with a guy who I happen to think is probably\none of the greatest joint commanders\nthat you\'ll ever\nrun across--General\nBob RisCassi. He and I monitored what was going on in the Gulf. We found it\nfascinating.\nI could go up to the Hardened Tactical\nAir Control Center in Osan. My troops could show\nme, in real time, the enemy order of battle--what\nsites\nwere emitting and what sites were not. These were\nthings we had never thought about before. It was a\ncapability that had existed, but the fact of the matter is\nthat we didn\'t know that the architecture\nexisted so\nthis information\ncould be sent around the world.\n\nTHE\n\nSo, when the war was over, General RisCassi\nsaid, "Ron, get a hold of the people at Space Command and have them tell me what they did for General\nSchwarzkopf.\nAnd, then I want them to tell me what\nit would take to build the same capability here." Well,\nan interesting thing happened. They brought a survey\nteam out from Space Command. They looked at what\nwe had in Korea. They said, General RisCassi, you\nhave, in place on the Korean peninsula, everything it\ntook us five months to build up for General\nSchwarzkopf."\nBut, we were ignorant of that. For\nexample, on the third hole of the [Osan Air Base] golf\ncourse, there was this antenna farm. We knew that if\nwe hit a golf ball in there, we couldn\'t go in and get\nit. It turns out that it was one of five downlink stations for DMSP [Defense Meteorological\nSatellite\nProgram].\nWe had this capability all along. What had\nhappened over the years is that a lot of folks looking\nfor a place to prototype equipment had brought it to\nthe Korean peninsula. So, it really drove home for me\nhow disconnected\nwe were in understanding\nspace.\nAnd, I will tell you, that the progress we\'ve made\nsince the war in the desert is just astounding.\nI think that space, in and of itself, is going to be\nvery quickly recognized\nas a fourth dimension of\nwarfare. Desert Storm left no doubt about that. And,\nyesterday, Jeff Harris, assistant secretary of the Air\nForce for Space, talked to you about Information\nWarfare. He described the tremendous\nadvancements\nwe\'re making in this area. And, because of the rate at\nwhich this information\ntechnology is moving forward,\nI think information\nwarfare is becoming a fifth dimension of warfare. Computer capacity is increasing.\nIn\nfact, it\'s doubling every 18 months. It is moving\nforward at such a rate that no one can afford to not be\nin the game. So, in a global sense, everyone is going\nto become dependent on this information\nflow and\nexchange. From that, you get both strengths and vulnerabilities.\nThat\'s why information\nwarfare--understanding\nit and being able to exploit\nit--will be critical. From my study of the history of\nwarfare, I know that successful people are those who\ncan--through\nmanipulating\ninformation--detect,\nplan,\nreact, and strike--faster\nthan the other guy. That\'s\nwhat information\nwarfare and space does for us.\nThis potential for information\noperations has been\nobvious all along. If you go back to the Second World\nWar, the allies used disinformation\nas a weapon. You\nremember\n[General George] Patton was part of a\ndisinformation\ncampaign before the Normandy invasion in 1944. At the time, it was a very rudimentary\noperation. The allies set up a fake Army headquarters\nand made fake transmissions.\nThey knew what the\nother side\'s capability to intercept was and played to\nthat. As a result, the Nazis ended up with a significant\nnumber of troops in the wrong place.\nIt is with this perspective that I think you can see\nhow information\nwarfare can be a tremendously\nhigh\nleveraging tool for today and tomorrow.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nFOR\n\nSPACE\n\nWe are moving forward to realize this potential\nwith a number of our programs.\nWe have our\nTALON programs that are beginning to pay dividends\nfor us. We have other assets too. We have the GPS\n[Global Positioning\nSystem] that gives us a tremendous capability, not only in navigation,\nbut also in\ntargeting and other data. MILSTAR and DSCS [Defense Satellite Communications\nSystem] provide us\nboth tactical and global communications.\nDSP [Defense Satellite Program] and ALERT are contributing\nto missile warning and tracking. We use weather\nsatellites for accurate meteorological\ndata. And, the\nwhole array of intelligence,\nreconnaissance,\nand observation satellites--all\nof these forces are dedicated to\ngetting data from the origin to the decision maker.\n\nI think that space, in and of itself, is going to\nbe very quickly recognized\ndimension\n\nas a fourth\n\nof warfare.\n\nAnd, we\'re working to ensure the warfighter gets\nthe same information,\njust as fast. We are dramatically\nreducing the time from detection to destruction of a\ntarget. Computers,\ncomm networks, and airborne\nsensors, like Joint STARS, play an important part in\nwhat I\'ve described. But, this potential of dominating\nthe information\nmedium is simply not possible without\nspace.\nSome audiences might consider that the things that\nwe talk about--our\ncapability today and what we\nproject for tomorrow--as\nunbelievable.\nBut, certainly\nnot this audience. Throughout\nmy years of service,\nI\'ve learned that space is the place where a vision\nbecomes a reality. I\'ve always admired those people\nwho have had the vision to move us forward. You are\nthe pioneers who take the risks, who make the sacrifices, who think boldly, and capture the promise of\nspace. This has been the case ever since Doctor [Robert] Goddard first launched a liquid-fueled\nrocket in\nMarch of 1926.\nAnd, it goes back farther than that. Think back to\nJules Verne\'s book From the Earth to the Moon, written in the 1860s. He described how, someday, we\nwould put man on the moon. At the time, his work\nwas called science fiction. Today, he is a prophet.\nThe only problem is what Jules Verne misjudged. He\nmisjudged not that man would walk on the moon--but\nthat the entire world would watch..,\non television\n\xe2\x80\xa2.. LIVE!\nIf anything, we may continue to miss the mark. If\nwe err, I suspect that we will not be thinking boldly\nenough about what air and space will do. And, I hope\nthat this is the crowd that will help us go beyond the\nvisions that are constrained\nby the minds of more\nconventional\nthinkers.\n\n157\n\nFEATURED\n\nSPEAKERS\nC.
