Bickler deserves first mention in these acknowledgements. Without his con\xc2\xad\ntinued encouragement, especially during the formulative stage of development, and his\ninsistence that we avoid rules of thumb whenever possible, the SAMICS methodology\nwould not be as widely applicable nor as thoroughly validated as it now is.\nSeveral people, specifically Bruce L. Kleine, James W. Doane, and David C. Crocker,\ncontributed very important ideas in the earliest stages of development. The Leontief for\xc2\xad\nmulation for calculation of indirect requirements resulted from discussions with Bruce\nKleine. The financial model of the firm is based, to some extent, on the model Jim Doane\ndeveloped for evaluating the cost of energy from utility-owned solar electric systems\n(Reference 1). The process model and the one-time cost model followed suggestions and\ncritiques provided by Dave Crocker.\nNumerous technical discussions with Robert W. Aster resulted in clarification and im\xc2\xad\nprovement of many of the detailed computational algorithms, especially those connected\nwith convergence of the indirect requirement calculation. He also developed the Interim\nPrice Estimation Guidelines (Reference 2), which was based on the SAMICS\nmethodology, and consists of a simplification suitable for manual calculation (see also\nReference 3). His constructive criticism in the later stages of development contributed\ngreatly to the validity and usefulness of SAMICS.\nTechnical suggestions by Chester S. Borden, Guy M. Lohman, and Paul J. Firnett have\nalso contributed to the final product.\nTheodore Barry and Associates, a management consulting firm, was engaged to criti\xc2\xad\nque the methodology and to develop the cost account catalog, the indirect requirements\nmatrix functions, and the capital cost estimating relationships (References 4, 5, and 6).\nThe contributions of the following individuals are especially appreciated: Robert J.\nBullemer, James B. Ayers, John Day, David Donovan, and Lawrence Rubenacker. (At\nthe time of this writing, Theodore Barry and Associates is comparing the results of ap\xc2\xad\nplying the SAMICS methodology, as implemented in the SAMIS III computer program,\nto conceptual point designs of three manufacturing plants prepared by conventional\nmethods.)\nThe SAMICS methodology has been implemented by a computer program, SAMIS Ill.\nI would like to express my appreciation to Donald A. Heimburger, Marcia A. Metcalfe,\nMuriel H. Horton, and David G. Weamer (as well as Paul J. Firnett and Bruce Kleine) for\ntheir assistance in coding, and to Cleo Benson, Judy Bevan, Lyn Morris, and Madre Till\xc2\xad\nman for their work on the many stages of the design document (Reference 7). A very im\xc2\xad\nportant silent partner in the evolution of the program design was the Software Design and\nDocumentation Language processor (Reference 8), developed at JPL by Henry Kleine.\nMany other individuals have also contributed to the development and application of\nthe SAMICS methodology. Among these are Brian D. Gallagher, Dale R. Burger, Timo\xc2\xad\n.thy Stevens, and Suresh Balakrishnan.\nSAMICS would not exist if it had not been supported by Harold L. Macomber,\nManager of Project Analysis and Integration; his successor, William T. Callaghan; and\nRobert G. Forney, Manager of the Low-Cost Solar Array Project.\niii\n\nAbstract\nThe Solar Array Manufacturing Industry Costing Standards (SAMICS) provide stan\xc2\xad\ndard formats, data, assumptions, and procedures for determining the price a hypothetical\nsolar array manufacturer would have to be able to obtain in the market to realize a\nspecified after-tax rate of return on equity for a specified level of production.\nThis document presents the methodology and its theoretical background. It is con\xc2\xad\ntended that the model is sufficiently general to be used in any production-line manufac\xc2\xad\nturing environment.\nImplementation of this methodology by the Solar Array Manufacturing_ Industry\nSimulation computer program (SAMIS III, Release 1) is discussed.\n\nv\n\nContents\n\n1.

Each firm is a realization** of a company whose characteristics\nare described by input.\n(2) \t Each firm contains a collection of work stations also arranged in a generalized\ntree structure. Each work station is based on an input manufacturing process\ndescription.\n(3) \t Each process description contains, among other things, a detailed list of direct re\xc2\xad\nquirements for facilities, personnel, utilities, materials, and supplies and a list of\nby-products produced. All of these expense items are contained in-the cost account\ncatalog.\n(4) \t Each entry in the cost account catalog contains the item identifier, an item-specific\nprice versus quantity relationship (possible nonlinear), an item-specific inflation\ntable, and a list of the first-level indirect requirements*** implied by the entry.\nRelative quantity functions are associated with each indirect requirement on the\nlist. The standard facilities construction and staffing assumptions (Reference 5,\nVolume II) are implied by the combined effects of all of the first-level indirect re\xc2\xad\nquirement relative quantity functions.\nB. \t SEQUENCE OF CALCULATIONS\nThe rationale for determining product prices is the required revenue condition: prices\nare to be chosen so that company revenues are just sufficient to recover all company ex\xc2\xad\npenses (including a specified profit). Since the cost of purchased products is one of the ex\xc2\xad\npenses, the prices of those products must have been determined. Therefore, price calcula\xc2\xad\n\nthe structure can be considered to be a restricted network. The restriction is that\nthere be no loops - it must be possible to order the companies in a list so that suppliers always\nappear somewhere below the companies they supply.\n**That is,there is a one-to-one correspondence between "firms" and "companies." The distinction\nis simply that all input descriptors (such as financial leverage and rate of return on equity) are\n* Alternatively,\n\nassociated-with "companies," while calculated results (such asproductpriceand annual returnon\n\nequity) are associated with "firms." This distinction is only important in the context of the\nSAMIS III computer program, and is not always adhered to in this report.\n***For example, a maintenance worker requires a maintenanceforeman at the first level of indirect\nrequirements and a security and maintenancemanager at the second level. The second-level re\xc2\xad\nquirement of a maintenance worker for a securityandmaintenancemanageris accounted for when\nthe first-level requirements of the maintenanceforeman are considered. Higher-level indirect re\xc2\xad\nquirements- are accounted for similarly.\n\n_\nCONVERT \n\nBACK TO\n\nSTART HERE\n\nPRICE\n\nEND \n HERE\n\n"sz"\nS\n\nINPUT INDUSTRY SIZE\n\nUNITS\n\n\nT4C\n\nCONVER\n\nN\xc2\xa5"--,\n\n"\n\nPRICE or\nAPR1CTE\nF\n- .-J\'------------------------UL\nFINAL PROCT TEATEEN\n\nTO PR\n\nO\n\nCM\nA LL\n\nAND\nDEFLATE\n\nRACT\n\nIE\n\nNI S\nCO P\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nSO\n\ngoDU\nCIIISI\n\nLF\n\nANNUAL\nD\'COMPANYPRDCIN\n\'CO-MPANY\nMODEL\n\nOF EACH\n\na\n\n7\xc2\xa9\nATE\nFIRM\'S TOTAL\nNNA EXPENSES\nTO\nWOKANNUAL\nFL TO\n\nRETLLC\nAOTA\nITERATE ON\nREVENUE\nCOSTS\nMISCELLANEOUS\nSCORPORATE ICOME TAX\n\nREQUIRE-AT\nNDNCONE-TIME\n\n.\n-iFIRM\'S\nDIRECT\n-REQUIREMENTS\nCOMPA\nPRODUCTS\nFLOOR SPACE\n\nTHE PRODUCTION\nSEQUENCE AND\nDIREC\nCOMPUTE\nREURMNSOF\n\nPERINFEREL\nBY-PRODUCTS\nCOMMODITIES\n\nRELATION-OTA\n\xc2\xa9FR\' OA\nSIS\nREQUIREMENTS\nNU\nMACNS\n\nAPPLY SUBMODELS\n\nINFLATION\nREPLACEMENT\nDEPRECIATION\n)\n/PRONL\nBY-RDCSINVESTMENT TAX CREDIT\nCAPITAL\nCWMDTSORKING\nANNALCEP\nINSURANCE\nPRODUCT.RESOURCES\n(INCLUDES ALL\nPROPERTY TAXES\nINDIRECTS)\nRETURN ON EQUITY\nINTEREST ON DEBT\nCOSTS\n\nTOTAL\nREQUIREMENTS\nTHE\nFIRM\n\nWOKONE-TIME\n\nFAILITIES\n\nJUTTESCAPITAL\n\n@ PRICE-INDEPENDENTI\nEXPENSES\nCPTLEPNE\nOEAIGEPNE\n\n\'SINUAC\n.-\n\n/\n\nPOET\nRTR\nITRS\n\nAE\nNEUT\nNDB\n\nLOAT\nSTATCATALO\n-FO\n\nPR\n\nR\nD~~\n(NXT COMAN\nANUAPRODUCTIO\nDE -PO\n\nPRI\n\nAK OTHCESUN\nMACHINES\nkPO\n\nWORKA\n\nDEM NDSKE\nND OE NS\nWOR STTOS\n\nR\n\n-ISTS\n\nQNG UA\nO\nIT\n\nESD\n\nT\n\nSTNARIEDDT\n\nAAO\nPRICE\n\nDE A DSK\nY\n\nCMANE\n(b(NEXT~~~\n\nCOMPANY DATATE\n\nC\n(CNPUTLR\n\nQUA[IT\n\nrn\n\nED)\nALULAT\n\nSWORK STATION (PROCESS) DATA\n(INPUT OR CALCULATED)\n\nCA\n\nwithin the industry.

(7)Total expenses include those which depend on\nOther price-independent expenses\n(8) By allocating the overhead to work stations, the price of every product, including (9) the product of interest, is ob\xc2\xad\ntained.\n\ntions must start at the raw materials end of the industry. Expenses also depend on the\nscale of operation. The scales of operation, on the other hand, are chosen to be just suffi\xc2\xad\ncient to manufacture the specified amount of the industry\'s final product. That is, quantity\ncalculations must start at the finished goods end of the industry. Since. prices depend on\nquantities, but quantities do not depend on price (demand is assumed), the quantity\ncalculations must be performed first. The resultant sequence of calculations is as follows:\n(15 \t The firms in the hypothetical industry are placed in a sequence which is ordered\nso that every firm appears on the list before any of its suppliers. Work stations in\neach firm are similarly ordered.\n(2) \t The industry size is an input. Every firm that makes the final product of the indus\xc2\xad\ntry is assigned an annual production quantity based on its (input) market share.\n(3) \t All quantities, of everything throughout the entire industry, which are implied by\nthe specified industry size are calculated by proceeding sequentially through the\nordered sequence of firms, starting at the finished goods end and continuing to the\nraw materials end. That is, the final output quantities are taken as given, and the\nquantities that must be produced at each preceding step, taking yield losses into\naccount, are determined sequentially. Some readers may prefer to think of the\nquantity calculations as proceeding backwards through the industry.\n(4) \t As each firm is addressed in turn, its direct requirements are calculated by se\xc2\xad\nquencing through the ordered list of work stations in much the same fashion.\nWhen all of a firm\'s direct requirements have been accumulated, the implied in\xc2\xad\ndirect requirements are inferred. (The algorithms for making these inferences are\nperhaps the major contribution of the SAMICS methodology to the state of the art\nof economic analysis of manufacturing.) The indirect requirements of the firm are\nthen allocated back to the work stations. Quantities of any required products that\nare not manufactured within the firm are added to the annual production quan\xc2\xad\ntities of the firm\'s suppliers.\n(5) \t After all quantities have been calculated, it is possible to estimate product prices\nby dividing each firm\'s total annualized expenditures by its annual production.\n(The actual algorithm is somewhat more complicated, so as to allow each firm to\nproduce more than one kind of product.) The determination of a firm\'s total an\xc2\xad\nnualized expenditures incorporates capital cost estimating relationships and fi\xc2\xad\nnancial submodels for capital replacement, depreciation, corporate income taxes,\ninsurance premiums, investment tax credits, property taxes, working capitdl, in\xc2\xad\nterest on debt, return on equity, miscellaneous expenses, and an amortization of\none-time costs such as interest during construction, start-up costs and revenues,\nand depreciation to steady-state. The effects of inflation are included in all of\nthese calculations. Eventually, all expenses are allocated back to the work sta\xc2\xad\ntions.\n(6) \t Since one component of a firm\'s expenses is the cost of products purchased\nelsewhere in the industry, product prices are calculated by sequencing through the\nordered list of firms from the raw materials end toward the finished goods end, so\nthat product prices will be available when needed.\n(7) \t Finally, each firm\'s profit and markup can be calculated.\n4\n\n\nSection, II\nThe Environment of the Hypothetical Industry\nA.\n\nAVAILABLE PROCESSES\n\nThe SAMICS procedure was initially developed to provide a means for comparing\nmanufacturing processes. Consequently, a fundamental part of the data environment is a\ncollection of process descriptions.\nA process, in SAMICS terminology, describes the basic complement of resources that\nmust be replicated to increase production capacity. The process may describe a machine,\na "stoichiometric" collection of apparatus, or simply the facilities required to perform a\nspecified function. The SAMICS procedure will generate work stations containing enough\n"machines" - copies of the template provided by the process description - to produce\nthe required amount of product.\nA process description has six parts (see References 10 and 11), in addition to a unique\nidentification:\nPartI - OutputProductDescription.In order to assign prices to products, it was necessary\nto require that each process produce one and only one product. If a real process being\nmodeled produces more than one product, two or more SAMICS process descriptions\nthat conform to this requirement must be prepared. It should be noted, however, that a\nproduct, in the SAMICS context, is an object that must be priced within the model; any\n"product" that can be assigned a price exogenously should be considered either a by\xc2\xad\nproduct (ifoutput by the process) or a commodity (if input to the process). Since quantities\nof the output product will be calculated, it is also necessary to specify the units in which\nthese quantities are expressed.\nPart2 -Process Characteristics. hree parameters suffice to describe the economically im\xc2\xad\nT\nportant operating characteristics of the process: (a) The average rate of production when\nthe process is operating. (b) The average time that goods spend being processed. This in\xc2\xad\nformation is used only for calculation of in-process inventory. (c) The duty-cycle fraction\nif at full production. This parameter includes consideration of reliability, maintainability,\nwarm-up and cool-down, and so on.\nPart3 - Equipment Cost Factors.To permit consideration of inflation, depreciation, and\nthe use of separate books for in-house accounting and for taxes, cost data must include\nnot only the purchase price and the anticipated useful life of the equipment, but also the\nyear for which the purchase price is valid, an inflation rate table, the salvage value, and\nthe cost of removing a worn-out piece and installing its replacement. Furthermore, the\nbook and tax depreciation methods must be specified.\nPart 4 - Direct Facilities and Personnel Requirements. Facilities are specified as the\namount needed per "machine." Personnel is given in terms of the amount needed per\n"machine" per shift.\n\n5\n\n\nPart5 - DirectBy-Products, Utilities, and Commodities Requirements. Data specified is the\nrate at which by-products are produced or utilities or commodities are used by each copy\nof the process.\nPart6 - InputProductRequirements.This data specifies how much of each product which\nis produced elsewhere in the modeled industry is required for each unit of this process\'s\nproduct.\nB.\n\nCOST ACCOUNT CATALOG\n\nThe cost account catalog serves two purposes. First, it provides standard prices for all\nof the expense items that are obtained from outside the modeled industry. Second, it pro\xc2\xad\nvides standard relationships between direct requirements and the indirect requirements\nthat they imply. In both cases, nonlinear relationships are allowed. Inflation rate tables\nare associated with each expense item.\nThe cost account catalog is,divided into six accounts:\nAccount A - FacilitiesParameters.The price versus quantity relationships associated with\nexpense items in this account express initial capital cost estimating relationships, and are\nnot used in the calculation of\'annual operating expenses. They do, of course, influence the\nannual capital expenses and, consequently, the total annual expenses. Account B - Personnel. Prices of expense items in this account are intended tq include all\nbenefits and "expense accounts," in addition to salaries.\nAccount C- Utilities-andPlantServices. Most of the expense items in this account have in\xc2\xad\ndirect requirements for facilities (for example, domestic water requires water service\nfacilities).\nAccount D - By-Products. By-products are sometimes produced by a process in addition\nto the products that define the structure of the industry. The -category of by-products in\xc2\xad\ncludes saleable items, such as rejected silicon wafers; recycleable scrap, such as reusable\npolysilicon; and effluents, such as poisonous fumes. The hypothetical industry does not\nproduce pollutants. Potential pollutants, such as poisonous fumes, have direct require\xc2\xad\nments for processing facilities.. Some of the processing facilities may reclaim a portion of\nthe by-product - these facilities would have negative indirect requirements for the\nassociated commodities (in Account E). For convenience, since there seem to be more po\xc2\xad\ntential pollutants than revenue-producing by-products, it was decided to associate posi\xc2\xad\ntive prices with those by-products that result in expenses and negative prices with those\nthat produce revenues.\nAccount E - Commodities. These expense items are simply the materials and supplies ob\xc2\xad\ntained from outside the modeled industry.\nAccount F- Resources. The procedures developed for calculating indirect requirements\n\'provide an opportunity to keep track of the requirement for natural resources, such as\n\n6\'\n\n\nenergy and silicon. Expense items in this account are never required directly and have no\nprices. These "priceless" expense items are inherent in (that is, indirectly required by)\n"priced" expense items - for example, each cubic foot of natural gas requires\n0.302 kilowatt-hours of the resource energy. These tabulations may be of particular in\xc2\xad\nterest if either the worldwide or the U.S. stock of particular resources is small.\nC.\n\nAVAILABLE COMPANIES\n\nThe data environment contains a collection of company* descriptions to facilitate com\xc2\xad\nparison of the effect of changes in the industry structure on the price of the industry\'s pro\xc2\xad\nduct.\nCompany descriptions contain a list of the products made, a list of the processes used,\nand a list of the suppliers (other modeled companies) for each product purchased from\nwithin the modeled industry. Each suppliers list also contains a specification of the per\xc2\xad\ncent of the annual requirement purchased from each supplier. In addition to these lists,\neach company description also specifies values for the financial parameters to be used for\nthat company.\nD. STANDARD DATA\nThe SAMICS methodology is extremely flexible, and should be able to provide\nreasonably good price estimates when used in a descriptive mode with real company data.\nFor the purpose of comparing manufacturing processes, however, the price estimates pro\xc2\xad\nduced should be normative, and based on realistic, but standardized data, so that it is in\xc2\xad\ndeed alternative processes which are compared, rather than alternative economic assump\xc2\xad\ntions. Hence, standardized values are provided for some of the equipment cost factors, for\nall expense item prices and indirect requirement relationships, for all inflation rates, and\nfor all of the company financial parameters. Standard values are also provided for the\nnumber of working minutes in a year, income tax rates, investment tax credit parameters,\ndepreciation methods, and a few other parameters.\n\n*In the SAMIS III computer program (References 7, 9) companies are associated with the data\nwhich is saved from one computation to the next, and firms are used to identify the calculated\nresults. Since companies and firms have a one-to-one correspondence, the two terms are used\nalmost interchangeably throughout this document.\n7\n\n-NM~EDV PAGE BtNIR41 "TfU$ED\n?\nSection III\nStructuring the Hypothetical Industry\nThe user defines the industry by specifying its final product and listing the companies\nthat make that product, with their market shares. Since each company description in\xc2\xad\ncludes a suppliers list for each product the company buys, the rest of the companies in the\nindustry are identified through the sequence of suppliers lists. These relationships are\nsuggested by Figure 2.\nSAMICS then creates firms to correspond to those companies and builds an industry\nstructure - an ordered list - that has the characteristic that all of a company\'s suppliers\nappear after it on the list. This.structure carries with it the implication (or assumption, if\nyou like) that there are no technological loops in the industry (that is, that no company\nbuys from a company that buys, even indirectly, from it).\nBruce L. Kleine developed an ingenious recursive algorithm for constructing the indus\xc2\xad\ntry structure. This algorithm, illustrated in Figure 3, builds the structure so that its defin\xc2\xad\ning characteristics are satisfied, and readily detects when the structure cannot be built to\nspecifications.\nA similar procedure is used within each firm to place work stations into a structured\nproduction area, in which supplying work stations always appear after the supplied work\nstations.\n20 x 106 Wpk/YR (INDUSTRY SIZE)\n5000 CRATES/YR (INDUSTRY PRODUCTION)\nS.~\n\xe2\x80\xa2 " .\n\nMODLECO\n30 x i06\nCELLS/YR\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nSORT IN AN ORDER THAT ALLOWS CALCULATION\nOF QUANTITIES IN ONE PASS\nVERIFY:\nDETECT INCONSISTANCIES OR INCOMPLETENESS\nTHEN ABORT IF NECESSARY\n\n9:A\n\n2000\nTONS/YR\n\n\'-\n\nWAFERS/YR\n\n..\nECOL\n\n20.x 1\nWAFERS\n\nC\n\n1000\nTONS/YR\nR\n\nRIBBON CO\n\nFigure 2. \t Structuring the SAMICS Industry.

Recursive Algorithm to Structure an Industry\n\n10\n\n\nSection IV\nCalculation of Quantities\nProduct prices are calculated by requiring company revenues to be equal to company\nexpenses. Expenses include the cost of products obtained from other firms in the industry\nand depend, to some extent, on the scale.of operation. Consequently, price calculations\nmust first be performed for those firms at the raw materials end of the industry structure.\nHowever, before those price calculations can be made, factory sizes must be determined.\nThe SAMICS procedure therefore starts at the finished goods end, makes a pass through\nthe industry during which all quantities are calculated, then makes another pass from the\nraw materials end during which all prices are calculated.\nThe calculation of product quantities requires sequencing through each firm\'s struc\xc2\xad\ntured process sequence (that is, through the work stations in the firm\'s production area). As\neach work station is encountered, the number of machines needed to produce that work\nstation\'s annual production quantity is calculated and the firm\'s direct requirements are\naccumulated.\nAfter all of a firm\'s direct requirements have been accumulated, the indirect require\xc2\xad\nments relationships are used to generate the firm\'s total requirements. To take proper ac\xc2\xad\ncount of the firm\'s economies of scale, the firm\'s final indirect requirementsmatrix is used\nto allocate indirect requirements back to the work stations.\nThe quantity calculations that are made for each company are illustrated in Figure\'4.\n\nkg\n\n\nFIRM\'S ANNUAL PRODUCT QUANTITY\n\nMANUFACTURING\nPROCESS\n_DESCRIPTION\n\nNUMBER OF\nMACHINES\n\nDIREC\n\nDIRECT\n\ni \'-\n\nT\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nINDIRECT\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nOTHER FIRMS\nANNUAL\nPRODUCT QUANTITIES\n\nFigure 4. \t Calculation of Quantities within a Tirm. Descriptions of the manufacturing pro\xc2\xad\ncesses used by the firm provide the information needed to calculate the numbers of\nmachines, the direct requirements, and the amounts of required products that the\nfirm needs to manufacture the necessary quantity of the firm\'s pro\'duct. Suppliers\'\nlists are used to determine quantities of the products to be manufactured by other\n\nfirms in the industry. The firm\'s indirect requirements are inferred from the direct\nrequirements. The resultant indirect requirements are completely allocated back\nto the processes.\n11\n\nA. PRODUCT QUANTITIES\nThe first step in calculating annual product quantities is to convert the industry\'s size,\nstated in terms of its objective,* into a product quantity.\n= (industry size)/(hardware performance)\n-\n\n(\n\nAnnual quantity of the final\nproduct of the industry\nExample:\nIndustry objective:\nExpressed in:\n\nNew photovoltaic power production capability\n\nPeak-watts per year\n\n\nIndustry size:\n\n15 x 106 peak-watts per year\n\nFinal industry product:\nHardware performance:\n\nSolar modules (of a particular design)\n\n140 peak-watts per.module\n\n\nThus, product quantity\n\n=\n\n15 x 106 /140\n\n=\n\n1.0714 x 105 modules/year.\n\nThe industry production is then assigned to each of the firms that make the industry\'s\xc2\xad\nfinal product according to their market shares.\nAnnual quantity of the final\nproduct allocated to a firm\nthat makes it\n\n\n/annual quantity of\n\n.\n\nthe final product\n\n*\n\n(firm\'s market share)\n\n\nSince each company may make more than one product, this quantity is inserted into the\nappropriate element of a product quantities vector, which could** already contain entries\nfrom exogenous demands (from outside the modeled industry),\nHaving thus gotten the final product production into the industry structure, it is now\nstraightforward to determine the production quantities of all other firms in the industry\nstructure. Each firm is considered in the order in which it occurs in the structure. As a\nfirm is encountered, its structured process sequence is followed, from the finished goods\nend toward the raw materials end. Process yields are used to determine the annual\namount of each required product needed. If the required product is manufactured by\nanother process in that company, the product quantity of that process is increased by the\nrequired product annual amount. If the required product is not manufactured within the\nfirm, the firm\'s procurement requirements are increased. After all of the procurement re\xc2\xad\nquirements have been determined, the company\'s suppliers list is used to augment the\nproduction quantities of the supplying firms according to the fraction of the procurement\nthat each supplies.\n*The term industryobjective may be somewhat awkward when SAMICS is applied outside the con\xc2\xad\ntext of the Low-Cost Solar Array Project. The basic idea is that the final product does something,\xc2\xad\nand that the industry objective is expressed in terms of the amount of that something. It maybe\nmore convenient to equate the industry objective to the industry\'s final product. Then, the iridus\xc2\xad\ntry size and -the industry\'s final product would be expressed in the same units, and the hardware\nperformance would be unity.\n"Incorporation of exogenous demand is not implemented in the SAMIS III computer program.\n12\n\n\nB. NUMBER OF MACHINES\nAs each work station is encountered while-proceeding through the firm\'s production\narea, a number of simple calculations are made. The relevant"equations follow:\nR =Q\nwhere\nR = \trequired number of machine operating minutes\nQ = \tannual quantity produced at this work station\nT = \toutput rate of one machine, in units per minute.\nA= F*P*\'NS*H* m*\'(D*W-E)\nwhere\nA = \tactual number of minutes that one machine operates in a year\nF = \tprocess usage fraction, the fraction of the time that the plant is operating\nthat a particular machine would operate if at full capacity -(considering\nreliability/maintainability, cleaning, set-up, warm-up/cool-down, etc.)\n\t\nP = fraction of capacity at which plant is operating\nNS = number of.shifts the company operates per fiscal day (normally 1,2,.or 3)\nH = number of fiscal hours the company operates during each shift (typically 8)\nm = number of minutes the company operates in each fiscal hour (60)\nD = \tnumber of fiscal days the company operates per fiscal week (normally 5 or\n7)\nW = \tnumber of fiscal weeks the company operates per fiscal year (normally 52)\nE = \tnumber of plant holidays per fiscal year-(may be none; the term (D * W -\n\nE) is the number of.days the plant is open during the fiscal year)\nN =\n\nR/A\n\nwhere N = actual number of machines needed to produce Q.\n\n13\n\n\nSince it is usually impossible to purchase a fraction of a machine, N is normally*\nrounded up to the next larger integer.\nM=R/[NS*H*m*(D*W -E)]\nwhere M = ideal number of machines required if there were no downtime and no extra\ncapacity.\nI =N-M\nwhere I = number of idle machines.\nC. DIRECT REQUIREMENTS\nThe direct requirements of each work station are obtained by multiplying the one\xc2\xad\nmachine direct requirements that are part of the input process description by a multiplier\nthat depends upon the cost account of the relevant expense item:\nIf the account is "A" (facilities parameters), then\n\nq=r*N\n\nwhere\nq = amount of this facility parameter needed\nr = amount of this facility required per machine (input)\nN = number of machines (after rounding to an integer).\n\nIf the account is "B" (personnel), then\n\nq=r* n* S\n\nwhere\nq = annual number of personnel (of this type) needed\nr = number of positions required per machine (input)\nn = number of machines (before rounding to an integer)\nS = shift multiplier,** in persons (required) per position\n*If the fraction is less than E* N, where e is an input, N is rounded down instead of up. Alter\xc2\xad\nnatively, non-integer numbers of machines may be allowed - if this option is used, results must\nbe interpreted with care, because it implies the assumption that machine prices are linear with\noutput rate.\n**In Release 1 of the SAMIS III computer program (References 7 and 9), the shift multiplier was\nfixed at a value of 4.7, corresponding to the following assumptions:\nNS = 3 shifts\nh = 8 hours/shift\n\nH = 8 hours/shift\nd = 5 days/veek\n\nD = 7 days/veek\nw = 52-1/7 weeks/year\n\nW = 52-1/7 weeks/year\ne = 8 days/year\n\nE = 20 days/year\nv = 13.5 days/year\n\na = 19.0 days/year\n\nLater releases, in which Swill not be fixed at 4.7, will take into account the fact that the indirect\nrequirement relationships also depend upon the number of shifts.\n\n14\n\nThe shift multiplier, S, is not simply the number of shifts; it must include consideration of\nholidays, vacations, sick leave, and absenteeism. It can be calculated by equating the\nnumber of hours that the company operates during ayearto the product of Sand the num\xc2\xad\nber of working hours produced by a person working one shift.\n\nS= [NS*H*(D*W--E)]/[h*(d*w--e-v --a)]\n\nwhere\nNS = number of shifts\n\nH = number of fiscal hours per shift\n\nD = number of fiscal days per fiscal week\n\nW = number of fiscal weeks per fiscal year\n\nE = number of plant holidays per fiscal year\n\nh = number of working hours per person for shift (normally, h = H, and both\nfactors can be omitted)\nd = number of working days per working week for personnel (normally 5,\nperhaps 4 or 6)\nw = number of working weeks per fiscal year for personnel (normally 52)\ne = number of paid holidays per fiscal year (typically 6 to 10; if E > 0, e may\nequal E)\nv = average number of paid vacation days (typically 10 to 15) per fiscal year\na = \taverage number of paid absenteeism days per fiscal year (sick leave, ill\xc2\xad\nness in family, etc.; the term (d * w - e - v - a) is the number of days the\naverage worker comes to work during the fiscal year).\n\n15\n\n\nIf the account is "C" (utilities and plant services), "D" (by-products), or "E" (com\xc2\xad\nmodities), then\nq=r*R\nwhere\nq = \t amount of this utility or commodity required or of this by-product pro\xc2\xad\nduced per year\nr = \t amount required (or produced) per machine per minute (input)\nR = \trequired number of machine operating minutes.\nDirect requirements for the firm are obtained by simply accumulating those of the\nwork stations within the firm. (The purpose of the accumulation is to take advantage of\nany economies of scale that result from the firm\'s larger purchasing power).\nD. TOTAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIRM\nOperation of a company requires more facilities, more staff, more utilities, and more\nsupplies than merely the direct requirements. A great deal of attention, typified by\nReferences 12-25, has been given to the problem of estimating what these additional re\xc2\xad\nquirements cost. The approach usually taken is to determine overhead factors by which\nthe costs of the direct requirements can be multiplied to obtain total costs. This approach\ncan be quite satisfactory when applied within an existing company or when applied to a\nwell-established industry. In fact, the manual implementation of the SAMICS\nmethodology, IPEG (Reference 2), uses it. However, determination of those overhead\nfactors requires the introduction of a variety of assumptions, some of which are ques\xc2\xad\ntionable when applied to an industry which does not have a historical data base. In par\xc2\xad\nticular, the IPEG model distinguishes five kinds of direct requirements: equipment costs,\nfloor space, personnel, utilities, and commodities (materials and supplies); few other\nmodels are as explicit as IPEG, so that comparisons between highly automated process se\xc2\xad\nquences and mostly manual process sequences resulting from such models would be\nunreliable. It should be pointed out that few, if any, of those models are applied to such a\nwide range of technological possibilities as SAMICS/IPEG must be.\nTo permit application to extremely wide ranges of possible industry and company sizes\nand of technological content, the SAMICS methodology makes an explicit determination\nof indirect requirements. A major portion of the SAMICS model of the hypothetical fac\xc2\xad\ntory is embodied in indirect requirements relationships (see Reference 5, Volume II),\nwhich are of the following form;\nINDi = Yj fij (TOT.)\n\n16\n\nwhere\nIND i = indirect requirement for expense item i\nTOT. = total requirement for expense item\nf\n\n3\n\n) = \t functional relationship represented for computational convenience as a\npiece-wise power function (Note: Power=l implies "linear"). (See\nReferences 26 and 27.)\n\nThe above equation expresses the description of indirect requirements used by\nSAMICS, but it is so mathematically succinct that it is somewhat obscure. The equation\nsays that the indirect requirement for expense item i is given by the sum of the indirect re\xc2\xad\nquirements for item i that result from the total amounts of every expense item (denoted j).\nFor example, consider the indirect requirement for passagesand corridors.Only three ex\xc2\xad\npense items have "first-level" indirect requirements for passagesand corridors:administra\xc2\xad\ntive office space,plant manufacturingoffice space, and total manufacturingfloor space. If we\nlabel these expense items 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively, we have\ni or j\n\n= 1 - Passagesand corridors\n\ni or j\n\n= 2 - Administrativeoffice space\n\ni or j = 3 ior j\n\n= 4-\n\nPlantmanufacturingoffice space\nTotal manufacturingfloor space\n\nfl 2 (TOT 2 ) = 1120 * TOT 2\n\nf1 3(TOT 3 ) = 1/15\nfl 4 (TOT4 ) =\n\n*\n\nTOT 3\n\n1/10 * TOT 4\n\nThat is, 1.0 square foot ofpassagesand corridorsis required for every 20 square feet of ad\xc2\xad\nministrativeoffice space, and so on. Then, the first-level indirect requirement for passages\nand corridors would be given by\nIND 1 = 1/20 * TOT 2 + 1/15 * TOT 3 + 1/10 * TOT 4\nUse of this formulation assumes that there is little interaction (other than additively) bet\xc2\xad\nween indirect requirements. Or, to put it another way, possible synergism among total re\xc2\xad\nquirements, with regard to indirect requirements, is negligible.\n\n17\n\n\nThe form of fj(TOTj) can be considerably more general than was shown in the above\nexample: A piece-wise power function has the general form:\np*\n(TOT-Si)p\n\nfor0 <TOT. <\n\nrij 2\t * (TOT. - S--2)P\nj\n\nfor a1 ! TOTj < a2\n\nrijk\n\nfij (TOTj) \t =\n\nfor ak\n\n*\n\n(TOT - Sijk)P\n\nTOTj\n\nThe fact that only first-level indirect requirements relationships need to be stated is a\nconsequence of using total requirements as the independent variable. Second-level in\xc2\xad\ndirects are obtained by finding the first-level indirects of the first-level indirects portion\nof the total requirements; third-level indirects come from the first-level indirects of the\nsecond-level indirects portion of the total; and so on. To illustrate this point, consider the\nabove example again. Administrativeoffice space (one of the determinants ofpassagesand\ncorridors)is a first-level indirect requirement of totalstaffpersonnel,which is a first-level\nrequirement of (52 kinds of staff personnel, including) assemblyforeman, which is a first\xc2\xad\nlevel requirement of (7 kinds of direct personnel, including) general assembler. Thus,\npassagesandcorridorsis a fourth-level indirect requirement of a generalassembler,and a\nchange in the direct requirement for a generalassemblerwill indeed cause a change in the\nrequirement for passages and corridors.\nSince the indirect requirements relationships are based on total requirements, and since\nonly direct requirements have been calculated so far, some kind of an algorithm is needed\nto deduce the total requirements.\nSuppose the total requirements of the firm were known. That is, suppose the annual\namount (or, in the case of facilities, simply the amount) of each expense item were known.\n(For convenience, some expense items are composites, such as office supplies.) There may\nbe a couple of hundred different items; the corresponding amounts can be put into a vec\xc2\xad\ntor, which can be denoted TOT. Then, the vector of annual indirect requirements,\ndenoted IND, is given by\nIND = R * TOT\nwhere R = \tthe indirectrequirementsmatrix (which is really a matrix of functional opera\xc2\xad\ntors, but which is an ordinary matrix of numbers if those functions are as sim\xc2\xad\nple as in the example just given -that is, simple multiples with no constant\nterm).\nBy defining a similar vector of direct requirements, DIR, another expression for TOT can\nbe written:\nTOT= DIR+IND\n\n18\n\nThe total, and simultaneously the indirect, requirements can be determined by solving\nthese two (potentially nonlinear) sets of equations. If the R matrix contains constants, the\nsolution* is\nTOT= (I-R)"1\n\n*\n\nDIR\n\nwhere I is the identity matrix.\nEconomists will recognize this result as similar to that obtained by Leontief\n(References 28-32) in his studies of input-output matrices. There are, however, several\nsignificant differences. In input-output analysis, the adjustments result in an equilibrium\nsolution set in a dynamic economic system, which has led to some criticism of the ap\xc2\xad\nplicability of the results. In SAMICS, all of the indirect requirements adjustments take\nplace during the designing of the factory, which is not a dynamic situation. Furthermore,\nas actually applied in the SAMIS III computer program, the indirect requirements matrix\ncontains not constants, but piece-wise power functions, which can provide a much more\npowerful description of the relationships.\nTwo algorithms (see Figure 5) have been developed to solve the two sets of equations.\nThe algorithms themselves are explicitly presented in Reference 7, pages 70 and 71;\ntheoretical analyses of these algorithms will be presented in forthcoming papers. Briefly:\n* The "fast" algorithm sets the first guess of the total requirements equal to the direct\nrequirements, then finds the indirects associated with each element of the total re\xc2\xad\nquirements vector. Each time an indirect requirement is changed (initially, they are\nall zero), the associated total requirement is changed. This procedure is continued\nover and over until the change in every indirect requirement is less than epsilon (an\ninput quantity) of the total requirement. There are some pathological indirect re\xc2\xad\nquirements relationships known that can cause this procedure to fail to converge.\n* The \t"slow" algorithm fills the indirect requirements matrix with the linearized\nslopes of the piece-wise power functions, then solves the Leontief equation (suitably\nmodified to account for the cobstant terms of the linearizations) by inverting the\nmatrix. A recursive partitioning scheme is employed to take advantage of the fact\nthat many of the elements in the indirect requirements matrix are identically zero,\n*An alternative derivation of this result can be obtained by noting that R * DIR generates indirect\nrequirements. These indirects lead to additional indirects: R* (R* DIR), and this process may be\nrepeated until the additional indirects generated are negligibly small. This procedure leads to the\nfollowing equation: "\nIND=R* DIR+R\n=(R+R\n\n2 *\n\nDIR +R 3 *DIR+.\n\n+R +.\n\n.)*\n\nDIR\n\nSo that\nTOT=DIR +IND.=(--+R+R\n\n2 + R3\n\n+...\n\nDIR\n\nIf the sum in parentheses converges, it converges to the expression given in the body of the text.Both derivations lead to an implementation problem. The R matrix is defined in terms of the\ntotal requirements, not the direct requirements. Hence, the computational algorithm must allow\nthe R matrix to be adjusted from the best original basis, namely DIR, to the correct basis, TOT.\n19\n\n\n"FAST" ALGORITHM: \t ALTER THE TOTAL REQUIREMENTS ONE AT A TIME UNTIL THE DIRECT\n\nPLUS THE INDIRECT IMPLIED BY THAT TOTAL EQUALS THAT TOTAL.\n\n\nTy\n\nNx(Ty)\n\nNx + Dx\n\nTx AS FUNCTION OF Ty\nN\n\n-\n\nNY (TX)\n\nTx\n\nDX \t\n"SLOW" ALGORITHM: SOLVE LEONTIEF EQUATION \t\nT= D+N \t\n= A+ B\nT C\nNN= A+8*-*(T - \n Q \t\n=>T= (I -B)\t\n\n".\n\n+ Dy = Ty AS FUNCTION OF Tx\n\n- I\n\n\n* (D+A-\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\nT = DIRECT\nD = TOTAL\n=\nND IDIRECT\nN IN DIRECT\n\nB * C)\n\nFigure 5. \t Two Algorithms for the Economy of Scale (Indirect Requirement) Calculation.\nThe "fast" algorithm finds successively better estimates of the indirect require\xc2\xad\nments vector one component at a time. The "slow" algorithm uses a piece-wise\nlinearization of the indirect requirements relationships, then improves the entire\nindirect requirements vector all at once by solving the Leontief equation. Addi\xc2\xad\ntional matrix inversions are needed until the solution is within the current piece of\nevery piece-wise linear function.\nthereby reducing* the size of the matrix to be inverted. This algorithm is not subject\nto the pathologies that could afflict the "fast" method, but there can be problems in\nchanging pieces at the breakpoints of the piece-wise continuous functions when solu\xc2\xad\ntions are beyond those breakpoints. Pathological indirect requirements relationships\nthat can cause this algorithm to fail to converge are also known.\nBoth algorithms need further attention on the theoretical level, but no difficulties have\nbeen experienced"* as of yet in actual applications.\n\nE.\n\nALLOCATION OF INDIRECT REQUIREMENTS TO WORK STATIONS\n\nOnce the indirect requirements of the firm have been determined, they are allocated\nback to the work stations for the subsequent process-by-process price determihations.\nCalculation of indirect costs, however, must have taken place at the company level in\norder to properly account for economies of scale.\n*In a recent application, the initial matrix had a rank of 165; six partitions reduced the rank to 48,\nthereby saving over 95% of the computational effort.\n"The current SAMICS standardized indirect requirements relationships data base does not con\xc2\xad\ntain any functions that are "pathologic" to the "fast" algorithm.\n20\n\n\nIn the previous section, the-Leontief equation,,\nTOT= (I-R)- 1 * DIR\n\nwas not applied explicitly. (The indirect requirements matrix, R, was identified as a\nmatrix of functional operators, The "fast" algorithm solves the two sets of equations from\nwhich the Leontief equation was derived, rather than the equation itself, and the "slow"\nalgorithm solves a modification of the Leontief equation that accounts for the constants\nthat come about when the functions are linearized.) It can be applied explicitly to the\nallocation of indirect requirements in the form\nTOT i = (I\n\n-\n\nR) "l , DIR\n\ni\n\nwhere\nTOT i = totil requirements of work station i\nDIR i = \tdirect requirements of work station i\nby defining the elements of R appropriately. That is,\nRij\n\n= \tthe amount of expense item i required indirectly by the firm per unit of the\n\ntotal requirement of the firm for expense item j.\nThen, since the Leontief equation is linear, summation of the work stations\' total require\xc2\xad\nments will equal the firm\'s total requirements. (Thus, all of the indirect requirements will\nhave been allocated.)\nThis is not the only allocation scheme possible. It might be desirable, for example, to\nassign to each work station the marginal(or change in) indirect requirements that would\nresult from putting this work station into the firm, rather than the average, which this pro\xc2\xad\ncedure assigns. If that were done,* the work stations\' indirect requirements would not\nsum to the firm\'s (nor, of course, would the total requirements).\nThe algorithm currently implemented in the SAMIS III computer program, after con\xc2\xad\nstructing the indirect requirements matrix as defined above, uses the recursive partition\xc2\xad\ning algorithm to invert the matrix once for the firm, then applies the Leontief equation to\neach work station.\nThe recursive partitioning algorithm was not available for the first release of the\nprogram (References 7 and 9), so an alternative algorithm was used.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2Implementation would be easy - simply use the same slopes as required by the "slow" algorithm\nas the values for the Rii.\n\n21\n\nIND i = R * TOT i\n\nTOT i\n\nDIR i + INDi\n\n\nSubstitute the second equation into the first, to get\nINDi = R\n\n(DIR i + INDi)\n\nRepeated substitution gives the algorithm shown in Figure 6, which assumes that R\nalready contains the appropriate indirect requirements matrix.\nLoop for each work station in the firm\nLet DIR = the work station\'s direct requirements vector\nLetINDONE= R* DIR\nInitialize INDOLD to INDONE\nInitialize INDNE W to R * INDONE + INDONE\nLoop until no element of the IND vector changes\nPut INDNEW into INDOLD\nLet INDNEW = R * INDOLD +I NDONE\nI\nRepeat for another iteration\n\nRepeat for the next work station\n\nFigure 6.

Referenc& 1), which states that each company\'s annual*\nrevenues must be just sufficient to allow the company to meet all of its annual expenses\n(which include a "reasonable" profit as one of the expenses).\nOnce product quantities have been determined throughout the hypothetical industry, it\nis possible to determine the total annual expenses of each company, and hence all product\nprices, provided the calculation starts at the raw materials end of the industry so that pro\xc2\xad\ncured product prices are always known when needed. (See Figure 7, which hints at the\ncomplexity of the problem, and possibly provides an excuse if the reader finds this section\nsomewhat confusing.)\nTotal annual expenses of a firm include the following components:\n*\n"\n"\n"\n*\n\nProcured product expense\n\nAnnual operating expense\n\nCapital-related expenses\n\nPrice-independent overhead expenses\nPrice-dependent overhead expenses\n\nEach of these components will be discussed in detail in the pages which follow.\n\n*The resultant normative SAMICS price is not likely to be the price observed in the marketplace,\neven though it does include profit as one of the expenses. First, marketing and distribution is out\xc2\xad\nside the scope of the SAMICS price estimate (but see Reference 33). Second, SAMICS assumes\nsteady production with no seasonal (or any other) variations in demand. Third, SAMICS assumes\nthat standardized plants are built, staffed, and operated from scratch; real factories will face\nspecial conditions that could increase or decrease some expenses. Fourth, SAMICS assumes a\nsteady, attractive, competitive environment. Real companies may choose to use complicated pric\xc2\xad\ning policies, and/or the marketplace may allow a higher profit than specified by SAMICS. Fifth,\nalthough SAMICS provides a very robust price estimate, real processes are likely to have some\xc2\xad\nwhat different characteristics than those supplied as input data, particularly when SAMICS pro\xc2\xad\ncess descriptions are derived from laboratory experiments rather than from in-plant observa\xc2\xad\ntions. Sixth, if SAMICS is applied to only a few of the products manufactured by a diversified\ncompany, the effects on overhead and economies of scale resulting from the other products being\nmade will not have been taken into consideration.\nOn the other hand, the SAMICS price estimate is based on a very comprehensive, detailed\nmodel of the costs of manifacturing, and takes into account economies of scale, the effects of\nautomation on overhead, the peculiarities of the tax laws, and a host of other factors. Extensive\nvalidation activities (Reference 4 and several not yet published studies) have shown SAMICS\nprices to be quite credible, even when some of the underlying assumptions (such as steadiness of\nproduction) are violated. Differences in price estimates resulting from computations based on\ncompeting processes can be expected to be highly accurate.\n\'Annual revenues and expenses are assumed to grow at the rate of inflation, so this condition will\nbe met every year - not just in the standard manufacturing year. Some of the expenses (especially\nthe amortized one-time costs) are annualizedequivalents of nonsteady cash flows. The annualiza\xc2\xad\ntion procedure used in the SAMICS methodology takes the effects of inflation into account as\nwell as the company\'s discount rat&.\n\n27\n\nnINCOME\n\nPRICE DEPENDENT EXPENSES\nTAXES\n\nPRICE\n\n"ONE-TIME"\n\n-AMORTIZED\n\nEXPENSES\n\nPRIEsUCTMISCELLANEOUS\n\xe2\x80\xa2oPRODUCT\n\nEXPENSES ON CAPITAL\n\nSALES\n\n.\n\nREVENUE%\n\n.%.\n\nDEPRECIATION\n\nINSURANCE\nPROPERTY TAXES\nPROFIT (RETURN ON INVESTMENT)\n\nTOTAL\nf ARNUE\n\nPRODUCT fUANTr\n\n,, ANNUAL\n\n4TOTAL\nBYPRODUCT\n"O\nINCOME\n\nKN\nN\nCAPITAL\nW\n\n-\n\nC\nCAPITAL\n?7ecIT\n\nPURCHASED\nPRODUCTS\n\n-CITS\n-TOPERATING\nEXPENSES\n\n-,\n\n\'\n\n.\n\n.\n\nEQUIPMENTq9>\nCOST_\n\nFigure 7. \t The Components of the Price Calculation. Inflation and the time value of capital\nmust also be considered. The most important point is illustrated at the upper left:\nProduct prices are determined so that annual revenues just equal the total annual\nexpenses, with profit - resulting from a specified rate of return on equity \xc2\xad\ntreated as one of the annual expenses. Profit margins and markups are computed,\nnot input.\nA.\n\nPROCURED PRODUCT EXPENSE\n\nThe \'products that the firm procures elsewhere in the modeled industry may be ob\xc2\xad\ntained from several suppliers, each of which may have a different price. Rather than try to\ndetermine a single price that might (or might not) result from marketplace interactions, a\nweighted average price is obtained, where the weighting factors are the fractions of this\ncompany\'s need which are supplied by each supplier.\nThen, each work station\'s annual cost of purchased products is augmented by the pro\xc2\xad\nduct of the average price of the procurement and the annual amount needed by the work\nstation.* (This does not include the costs of placing the orders for purchased products, as\nthey result from the indirect requirements associated with the procurement department.)\n\n*An alternative approach would be to buy entirely from the lowest price supplier. A user of the\nSAMICS methodology can rerun SAMIS with a revised suppliers list to assess the implication. The\nSAMIS program cannot use this approach without redoing the quantity calculations for that entire\nend of the industry. To put it another way: The structure of the industry is implicitly defined when\nthe suppliers\' percentages (and market shares of the makers of the final product) are input. All\nmanufacturing capacities are implicitly defined when the industry size is input. A firm cannot buy\nmore from any supplier than was specified as input because that supplier is already operatihg as\nclose to capacity as he wants to.\n28\n\nB. ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSE\nThe operating expense is the cost of obtaining all of the firm\'s annual requirements for\nexpense items in accounts B, C, D, and E (that is, personnel, utilities, by-products, and\ncommodities) -except revenue-producing by-products -plus the cost of procured pro\xc2\xad\nducts. Revenue-producing by-products are excluded from this calculation because the an\xc2\xad\nnual operating expense is used later in the working capital computation, and it is assumed\nthat by-product revenues do not reduce working capital requirements (Reference 4). The\neffect of by-product revenues on total annual expenses is treated explicitly later on.\nThe price of each expense item is obtained by interpolating in the price versus quantity\ntable contained in the standardized cost account catalog, thereby obtaining purchasing\neconomies of scale at the firm\'s level of operation. This price is then escalated by the in\xc2\xad\nflation rate table applicable to that expense item (which is also supplied by the stand\xc2\xad\nardized catalog) to the standard manufacturing year.\nPrices are multiplied by quantities and added to the firm\'s annual operating expense.\nThe calculated prices are also saved for later use at the work station level of computation.\nC.\n\nCAPITAL RELATED EXPENSES\n\nThe term capitalrelatedexpenses is used here to refer only to those expenses that can be\nreadily attributed to the work stations: equipment replacement, facilities replacement,\n-depreciation (the IRS-acceptable model of replacement expenses), and investment tax\ncredit. The remaining expenses that result from the need for capital investment are\ntreated later in this document as overhead: insurance premiums, nonincome (property)\ntaxes, interest on debt, return on equity, one-time costs, income taxes, and, inevitably,\nmiscellaneous expenses. In the course of calculating capital related expenses, it is neces\xc2\xad\nsary to determine the initial value and both the accounting and the tax book values of\nland, facilities, and equipment.\n\nLAND\nCAPITAL\n\nFACTORY\nCAPITAL\nFLOOR SPACE\n\nLAND AMT \t\nHVAC\nCAPITAL\n\nPHOTO-RESIST\n\nROOM CAPITAL\nFLOOR SPACE\nDEIONIZED\nWATER\n\nOFFICES\nCAPITAL\n\n-\n\nFLOOR SPACE\nELECTRICAL-\n\n\nSUBSTATON\n\nHVAC LOAD \t\nPARKING\n\nLOTS\n\n\nFUME\nTREATMENT\n\nANNUAL AMT\n\nELEC.

Capital Replacement Expenses and Annual Investment\nThe calculations described in this subsectiont are performed for each work station in\nthe firm and the resultant expenses and values are accumulated for the firm. Similar\ncalculations are performed for the firm\'s facilities, except that the "purchase cost" for\nfacilities is obtained by summing costs of the firm\'s requirements for expense items in ac\xc2\xad\ncount A (see Figure 8), salvage value is assumed to be negligibly small, and the "cost of\nremoval and installation" is assumed to be included in the prices. The "payment float in\xc2\xad\nterval" (defined below) is also assumed to be negligible.\n\nFirst, the cost of replacing each component in the machine description of the process is\ndetermined:\nCINVdeflated = Cdeflated - Sdeflated\n\nwhere\nCINVdeflated\n\n= \t investment\n\nneeded to replace the component, expressed in com\xc2\xad\nponent price year (an input) dollars\n\nCdeflated\n\n= \tpurchase\n\nSdeflated\n\n= \tsalvage\n\ncost of a new component (input)\n\nvalue of the replaced component (input).\n\nCRPLdeflated\n\n=\n\nCINVdeflated + Rdeflated\n\nwhere\nCRPLdeflated\n\n= \t cost\n\nRdeflated\n\n= \t cost\n\nof replacing the component\n\nof removing a worn-out component and installing a replace\xc2\xad\nment (input).\n\nThe component\'s escalation rate table (input) is used to exptess the initial cost, the in\xc2\xad\nvestment, and the replacement cost in manufacturing year dollars:\nCINIT = Cdeflated * (inflation factor)\n\nCINV = CINVdeflated * (inflation factor)\nCRPL = CRPLdeflated * (inflation factor)\n\nThe capital value of the equipment needed to build the work station in the standard\nmanufacturing year is obtained by multiplying the initial cost of the component, CINIT,\nby the number of machines and summing for all of the components\'.\n30\n\nThe company does not have to replace every machine every year. Consequently, capital\nreplacement expenditures will vary from year to year. This is rather awkward, since an\nannual expense is desired. The expected annual expense, however, can be readily deter\xc2\xad\nmined by noting that the probability that replacement expenses will occur in any particu\xc2\xad\nlar year* is the reciprocal of the anticipated useful life. If the plant has many pieces of\nequipment, not necessarily all the same kind, summation of expected replacement costs\nshould provide a very good estimate of the actual replacement costs. Filrthermore, since\nthe objective of determining these costs is to estimate product prices, and those prices are\nunlikely to vary significantly as a result of stochastic variations in equipment lifetimes, the\nuse of expected lifetimes is further justified.\n\nIf the company can receive and install a component before it must be paid for, the pay\xc2\xad\nment float interval can be used to further reduce the cash outlays required. (The default\nvalue of the payment float interval is zero.)\nThe contribution of the component to annual capital replacement expense and to the\ninvestment made in the standard.manufacturing year are given by the following equations.\n\nf =NI [(1 + k)v\n\n-\n\nL]\n\nwhere\nf = \tfactor to account for the number of machines, the payment float interval,\nand the machine lifetime\nN = number of machines\nk = \tthe firm\'s average after-tax cost of capital\n=\n\n(1 -\n\nr) * (X - 1) * i/X + r/X\n\nv = \tpayment float interval\nL = \texpected useful life\nr = \tthe firm\'s income tax rate**\nX = \tthe firm\'s capital leverage = (total capital I equity)\ni = \tthe firm\'s debt interest rate\nr\t\n\nthe firm\'s rate of return on equity.\n\n*That is, "in any particular year - after the plant has been in operation for several equipment\nreplacement cycles so that it has reached steady-statecbnditions." The impacts of non-steady-state\nconditions on expenses are discussed in detail in the section on the amortization of one-time costs.\nThe consequences and implications of starting factory operation with all new facilities and equip\xc2\xad\nment are discussed in the subsection on depreciation to steady-state.\n"Strictly speaking, the firm\'s income tax rate will not be known until after the total revenues have\nbeeh calcufated. SAMICS assumes that the largest rate in the income tax rate tables will provide\nsufficient accuracy for this calculation.\n\n31\n\n\nRPL = CRPL * f\n\nINV=CINV* f\n\nwhere\n= \t contribution\n\nRPL\nINV \t\n\nto the firm\'s annual equipment replacement expense\n\ncontribution to the firm\'s capital investment in the standard manufacturing\nyear.\n\nThe annual investment, INV, is calculated in order to determine investment tax credit,\nbook. values; and depreciation, which are discussed in the next three subsections.\nITC = INV * itc\nVALbook = INV * book\nVALtax\n\n=\n\nINV * tax book\n\nDEP = INV * dep,\nwhere\nITC = \tcontribution to investment tax credit\nVAL = \tcontribution to capital valuation of the firm (either accounting\nbook value or tax book value)\nDEP = \tcontribution to annual depreciation (for use in computing income\ntaxes)\nitc\n\nbook 7 =\nfactors whose values will be developed in the next three subsec\xc2\xad\ntxbook\ntax dep\ntions.\n\n2. Investment Tax Credit\nTo encourage investment in durable equipment, the government allows a tax credit for\nequipment investments. No investment tax credit is currently allowed for facilities invest\xc2\xad\nments, but the SAMICS methodology provides, an option to permit investigation of the\nprice impact of a suitable change in the law.\nThe SAMICS-investment tax credit submodel is shown in Figure 9, and is based on the\ndiscussion in Reference 4.\n\n32\n\nA\xc2\xad\n\nz\n\n>\n\n0\n\nA - UF-\n\n*R A\n\n-*F\n\nO\n\nI\n\nB\n\nM\n\nI\n\nT\n\n\nTAX LIFE, YEARS\n\nFigure 9. \t Investment Tax Credit Submodel. The investment tax credit allowed to encourage\n\ninvestment in durable goods depends upon the tax life used in the depreciation of\n\nthat equipment as shown in this figure. No credit is allowed if the tax life is less\n\nthan 3 years, 1/3 of the maximum credit is allowed if the life is between 3 and 5\n\nyears, 2/3 if between 5 and 7 years, and the full 11% of the credit is allowed if the\ntax life is 7 years or more. The numerical parameters of this function are stand\xc2\xad\nardized inputs to the SAMICS methodology.\n\nA = standard investment tax credit rate (input, default is 11%)\nUF = standard upper fraction (input, default is 2/3)\n\nLF = standard lower fraction (input, default is 1/3)\n\nT = standard upper life (input, default is 7 years)\n\nM = standard middle life (input, default is 5 years)\n\nB = standard bottom life (input, default is 3 years)\n\nTax Life = standard tax life fraction (input, default = 2/3) * expected useful life\n\nTax Life is generally rounded up to the next integer, if this calculation does not produce\nan integer.\n\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1976 (see Reference 4) limits investment tax credit to 50% of\nthe current year\'s federal income tax liability, but unused credits can be carried forward 7\nyears or back 3 years. The hypothetical SAMICS company operates in a steady-state, so\nno carry-forward or carry-back need be considered. The investment tax credit is limited\nto a standard maximum percentage of federal liability (input, default is 50%).\n3. Book Valuation\nIt was noted in the subsection on-capital replacement expenses and annual investment\nthat the company does not have to r~plate all of its capital goods every year. The expected\nvalue of the investment in the standard manufacturing year was then calculated. An esti\xc2\xad\nmate of the previous year\'s investment can be calculated by de-escalating that investment.\n..33\n\n\nThis procedure can be continued backward, year by year, to obtain an estimate of the in\xc2\xad\nvestment that was made in every year in the past. Past years\' investments can then be used\nto determine current book values as discussed in the rest of this subsection.\nThe current book value of an investment made several years ago has, as a rule*,\ndiminished from its original value due to depreciation.\nThe fraction by which the initial investment has decreased due to depreciation\n(denoted sched in Figure 10 and below) is a function of the depreciation method used, the\nlifetime assumed, and the age of the investment. Three depreciation methods (see\nReference 34) are available in SAMICS: straight-line, sum-of-the-years-digits, and dou\xc2\xad\nble declining balance.\nThe facts that older investments were smaller due to escalation and that they have\ndepreciated due to their age are combined in calculating book and tax book. These two\nfractions will generally differ in numerical value because the tax life is less than the ac\xc2\xad\ncounting life (which is generally equal to the expected useful life) and because accelerated\ndepreciation (double declining balance, for example) is usually used for tax purposes,\nwhile straight-line depreciation is used for the accounting books.\nClosed-form expressions can be obtained for book and tax book if the escalation rate is\nassumed to be constant. SAMICS, however, allows escalation rates to be specified on a\nyearly basis, so the summations are performed explicitly (see Reference 7, page 205).\nFigure 11 illustrates the combined effect of the two phenomena. Book (or tax book) is the\nsum of the depreciated values as of time = now. If the escalation rate is positive or the\ndepreciation is faster than straight-line, or both, the numerical value of book will be less\nthan one-half of the lifetime, so that the book value of capital assets (the product of book\nand the current investment) will be less than half of the initial value of capital expressed\nin current dollars. (This last number is the replacement cost of capital goods, not includ\xc2\xad\ning the costs of removal and installation.)\n4. Depreciation\nAn estimate of the expected value of the cost of replacing capital goods has been calcu\xc2\xad\nlated explicitly above. This cost, however, is not what is entered on the corporate income\ntax return as the depreciation of capital during the year. Indeed, the estimated cost of\nreplacing capital assumes that the real value of the company\'s capital is held constant.\nTax laws allow a deduction for a decrease in capital value and also provide further in\xc2\xad\nvestment incentive (beyond the investment tax credit) by allowing accelerated deprecia\xc2\xad\ntion methods and shortened tax lives.\nThe depreciation factor, dep, used for computing the depreciation reported on the tax\nreturn is obtained in SAMICS by summing the differences between last year\'s tax book\nvalue and this year\'s over all of the capital assets.\n*The capital value of land isan exception to this rule. Tax laws (see Reference 4) allow land to be\ncarried at its purchase cost or its current market value, whichever is smaller. SAMICS values land\nat its purchase cost, and assumes that it was purchased (by a lump sum payment) a year or two (the\nplant construction leadtime plus the plant start-up period) before the start of the standard\nmanufacturing year.\n34\n\n\nIf the method is "straight-line," then\nIf the life is greater than one year and 0 < age < life,\nSched = I -- age / life.\nBut if the life is less than one year and age = 0,\nSched = 1.\n\nWith any other combinations of life and age,\nSched-= 0.\nIf the method is "sum-of-the-years-digits", then\nIf the life is greater than one year and 0 < age < life,\nSched = I - [age I (life + 1)] * 12 + (I - age) / life].\nBut if the life < one year and age 0,\nSched = 1.\n\nWith any other combination of life and age,\nSched = 0.\nIf the method is "double declining balance", then\n\nLet T = the integer part of life / 2, and\n\nIf life > 2 years and 0 < age < T,\n\nSched = (I - 2 / life) ** age.\n\nWhile if life > 2, but T < age < life,\nSched = I(1 - 2/11ife) ** T] * [1 - (age - T)/(life - T)J.\n\nIf life= 2andage=Oor I\nSched = 1 - age /2.\nIf life < 2 and age 0,\nSched = I.\nWith any other combination of life and age,\nSched = 0.\nFigure 10. Depreciation Algorithm, for Computing Sched, the fraction by which an\ninvestment has depreciated, as a function of method, life, and age.\n5. Working Capital\nOperation of a company requires working capital, in addition to the capital tied up in\nland, facilities, and equipment. The working capital requirements can be estimated by a\ndetailed consideration of in-process inventory values, payroll intervals, tax hold-backs,\ndividend schedules, cash, short-term investments, and so forth. A simpler method, which\nis similar to the procedure suggested in Reference 35, is to multiply.the annual operating\nexpenses by the fraction of a year between payment for input goods and the receipt of pay\xc2\xad\nment for finished products. The resulting estimate can be thought of as the amount of\n35\n\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1.0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI|\n\nAMOUNT OF\nYIN\n\nINVESTMENT\nYEAR t\n\n-Or\n\nOF\n\n~VALUES\nu\n\nINVESTMENTS\n\nu\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nAGE\nETC.\n\n3 YEARS\nAGO\n\nYEAR\nLAST\nBEFORE\nYEAR\nTIME, t\n\nNOW\n\nNEXT\nYEAR\n\nFigure 11. \t The Combined Effect of Escalation and Depreciation on\nBook Values of Capital Investments\ncapital tied up in the production "pipeline." An estimate produced in this fashion will be\nfar more accurate-than the sometimes-used specified fraction of facilities and equipment\ncapital, which ignores the relationships between working capital, the prices of input pro\xc2\xad\nducts, and the amount of time required to process inputs.\nThe SAMICS working capital submodel is given by the following equation.\nWC = OPR * TWC\nwhere\nWC = \tworking capital required by the hypothetical company\nOPR = \t annual operating expense of the company\nTWC \t = working capital time lag, which is calculated as follows:\nTWC \t= trm + tp* m + tfg + tar - tap\nwhere\ntrm = \ttime raw materials spend in inventory, on the average, before being used,\nexpressed in years\ntp = \ttime spent in processing, obtained by summing processing times (input) for\nall processes, expressed in years\nm = processing time multiplier (input), to account for delays in the process se\xc2\xad\nquence\n\n\n36\n\ntfg = \t time finished goods spend in inventory, on the average, before being sold,\nexpressed in years\ntar = accounts receivable turnover time\n= time between sale of finished goods and receipt of payment, expressed in\nyears\ntap = accounts payable turnover time\n\n= \ttime between receipt of raw materials and payment for them, expressed in\nyears.\nD. OVERHEAD EXPENSES\nMuch of what is often characterized as overhead has already been explicitly accounted\nfor as the expenses associated with the indirect requirements. There remain, however, a\nvariety of expenses that are necessary to the operation of a company which have not yet\nbeen taken into account.\n1. \tInsurance Premiums\nInsurance premiums are based on the cost of replacing the insured goods rather than\ntheir book values, which is consistent with industry practice. The SAMICS submodel for\nthe annual premium paid by the company is given by the following equation.\nINS = (FAC + EQUIP + WC * f) * v\n\nwhere\nINS = annual insurance premiums in the standard manufacturing year\nFAC = initial facilities capital\nEQUIP = initial equipment capital\nWC = working capital\n\nf = insurable fraction of working capital (input)\nv = company insurance rate (input).\n\nIt may be noted that if the company is not to be insured to its full replacement value, the\ncompany insurance rate could be given an input value that reflects the actual fraction in\xc2\xad\nsured. The company insurancerate would then be interpreted as the effective company in\xc2\xad\nsurancerate.\n\n37\n\n\n2. Non-Income (Property) Taxes\nNon-income taxes include real estate taxes, inventory taxes, and any other ad valorem\ntaxes that are not based on corporate income. The SAMICS submodel estimates these\ntaxes as a specified fraction of the tax book value of the company.\nOTX = VALtax\n\n*\n\n/3\n\nwhere\nOTX = annual non-income taxes of the company\nVALtax = \t capital value of the company, as recorded in the books kept for tax\n\npurposes\n\n/3 = non-incom6 tax rate (input).\n3. Interest on Corporate Debt\nA fraction of the firm\'s total (accounting) book value is financed by corporate debt.\nSAMICS assumes that the hypothetical company\'s fiscal policies are such that this frac\xc2\xad\ntion remains constant.\n\nINT = VALbook\n\n*\n\nx\n\n*i\n\nwhere\nINT - annual payment of interest on corporate debt\nVALbook = capital value of the company, as recorded in the accounting books\nX = financial leverage, the ratio of total capital to equity capital (input)\ni = debt interest rate.\n4. Return on Equity\nThe remaining fraction of the firm\'s total book value is assumed to be financed by\nequity capital. In the real world, .the return paid to the equity holders depends upon the\nquantity of manufactured goods sold and the price obtained in the market. In the hy\xc2\xad\npothetical SAMICS world, the quantity sold is specified, and the market price needed to\ncover all expenses and to provide a specified after-tax rate of return on equity is the pri\xc2\xad\nmary output.\n\n38\n\nEQR- -- VALbook*.\nwhere\nEQR = \tafter-tax return on equity\nVALbook = capital value dif the company\nr = rate \tof return on equity (input)\nA = financial leverage.\n\nThe SAMICS company is assuied to operatein a steady-state condition. Hence, all of the\nreturn on equity can be considered to be distributedearnin to the equity holders. This\ngs\nassumption is not essential, however: a portion (unspecified, insofar as SAMICS is con\xc2\xad\ncerned) could be retained by the company and used for other ventures. (See also the dis\xc2\xad\ncussion on the distribution of the capital resulting from depreciation to steady-state in the\none-time costs section.)\n\n5. Amortized One-Time Costs\nEach SAMICS firm must produce enough revenue to recover* not only the expenses in\xc2\xad\ncurred during steady-state operations, but also the net** excess of costs over revenues\nduring each year that cash flows are not in a "steady-state." These net costs are expressed\nas a present value as of the start of the standard manufacturing year and then replaced by\nan annual expense term, which, growing at the rate ofgeneral inflation and continuing for\na standard -capital recovery time, produces the same present value.\n.AOC = OTC * gcrf(k,-Tcr, gt\nwhere\nAOC = \tamortized one-time cost, the annual expense in the standard manufacturing\nyear which, continued for Tcr years and increasing according to the general\nrate of inflation, produaes the same present value as OTC\nOTC = \tpresent value, as of the start of the standard manufacturing year, of all of\n\'the one-time costs\n*The SAMIS III computerprogram provides a switch -the run.control:steady.state.flag-which\nmay be turned "on" to avoid the calculation of tlieone-time costs described in this section. The\nresultant price would be that which the company would have to receive, after operating for the\nstandard capital recovery time, in order to meet all of its expenses and provide the specified\nprofit, assuming that it is planning to stay in operation-for an indefinite period into the future.\n**One-time costs occur in a nonuniform fashion over a period of many years. To account for this\nfact, the SAMICS methodology computes their present values as of the start of the standard\nmanufacturing year. .These computations take into accouht the timing ofithe expenditures, the\n-escalation rates that determine the dollar amounts bf all Qutlays, and the firin\'s cost. of-,capital.\nThe resultantpresent value is the equivalent amount of capital that would be required if it were\nprovided in a lump sum at the start of the standard manufacturing year..\n\n39\n\n\ngcrf( ) = generalized capital recovery factor\nk = firm\'s after-tax cost of capital\nTcr = standard capital recovery time* (input)\ngt\n\n=\n\nrate of general inflation (an input table as a function of time).\n\nThe generalized capital recovery factor (see Reference 1, pp. B-12 and B-13) is a\nmodification of the conventional capital recovery factor and accounts for growth of the\nannual payment at the rate of inflation. It can be defined as the numerical value of the\nfirst term in a growing Atream of Tcr annual cash flows which starts at the beginning of the\nstandard manufacturing year and has a present value of unity. It can be derived by equat\xc2\xad\ning the present value of a stream of inflating cash flows with an initial value of gcrf to\nunity and solving. The following result is obtained.\n!

The SAMIS III computer program takes advantage of the fact that the sum can be\nexpressed in closed form for those periods during which inflation is assumed to be\nconstant.\ngcrf(k, Tr\ncr, )\n\nTl\n\n-g\n\n+g\n\n+- k\n\nT cr\' -\n\nif gt=g forallt\nland k g\n\nIf the inflation rate is zero, this expression reduces to the conventional capital recovery\nfactor.\n\ncrf(k, Tcr) =-gerf(k, Tcr, 0)\n\n\xc2\xad\n1/Ter\n\n=\n\nl/Tcrif\n\nifk\n\n0\n\nk =0\n\n*The nominal value of Tcr is infinity, for otherwise the one-time costs would be recovered more\nthan once. Consequently, if the rate of general, inflation were constant, the generalized capital\nrecovery factor would be approximately equal to k - g. (The subscript on g was dropped to suggest\nits constancy with respect to time.)\n40\n\n\nThe problem of this subsection has thus been reduced to that of determining the present\nvalue of the net excess of "one-time" costs over revenues. The following components have\nbeen identified*:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nLand purchase\nConstruction of facilities\nInitial installation of equipment\nInvestment tax credit\nAccumulation of working capital\nStart-up costs (and revenues)\nDepreciation to steady-state\n\nSuppose that at the t = T, a capital expenditure of an amount L is made. This ex\xc2\xad\npenditure becomes a part of the capital value of the firm. As this capital good ages, it will\ndecrease** in value***. This decrease is accounted for in the SAMICS methodology by\nthe replacement of capital term, RPL, which has two functions. When the firm is very\nyoung, no repairs or replacements are needed, and all of.RPL goes**** to the investors,\ncompensating them for the decrease. When the firm is mature, all of RPL is used to main\xc2\xad\ntain the capital stock at its average depreciated value. Between the youth and the maturity\nof the plant, RPL performs a mixture of these two functions.\nThe hypothetical investors in a SAMICS firm are "guaranteed" a return on their invest\xc2\xad\nment (by the required revenue condition), whether the firm has started manufacturing or\nnot. By the start of the standard manufacturing year, the firm has accumulated an obliga\xc2\xad\ntion to the investors given by the following equation.\n\nOTC= [(1 +k)tm-T_1]\n\n*L\n\nwhere OTC = the present value, as of the start of the manufacturing year, tin, of the\nobligation to the investors resulting from a capital outlay of L made at\ntime T.\n(It may be noted that T could be at or after tm, as well as before it.)\nUnfortunately, the acquiring of capital goods also leads to insurance and property tax\'\nexpenses, the funds for which must also be obtained from the investors when the expenses\noccur before the plant is in operation.\n\n*It isassumed that oie-time revenues (and costs) resulting from eventual removal of the factory\nand salvage of its facilities and equipment will take place so far in the future that, for all\nreasonable values of the discount rate, their effect on price can be neglected.\n*Land is an exception: its value is assumed to remain constant.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ** In this context, value is equivalent to usefulness, future productivity, or worth; the replacement\n\ncost - even the market price of the used good - may increase due to inflation. An economist\nmight call this the "value (in real terms)."\n* * * The usual mechanism for this return ofcapital isexpansion - an increase inthe capital stock of\nthe company. As a consequence, the investors do not receive dividends, but neither does their\nstock depreciate. The mechanism is not, however, relevant to the SAMICS methodology.\n41\n\n\nOTC= (l+\n\n*E\n\nwhere OTC = \tthe present value, as of the start of the manufacturing year, tin, of the\nobligation to the investors resulting from an expense of E made at time T.\nPresent Value of Early Land Purchase\nThe expenditure for land was calculated in the course of estimating the capital-related\nexpenses on the assumption that it was purchased at the start of the year that contained the\nstart of construction. This expenditure itself is not to be considered a one-time cost (even\nthough it occurs only one time), because the value of land stays in the company. Capital\nvalues are accounted for by the payments made to the suppliers ofcapital. One-time costs\nresult from the fact that land is purchased before the company starts producing revenue.\nAt the end of \teach year after purchase, the company must pay taxes on the land.\n(SAMICS assumes that the tax rate is f,with the same numerical value as was used in the\ncalculation of "other taxes".) The funds to pay those taxes must come from the suppliers\nof capital.\nThe present value of the additional obligation to the capital suppliers resulting from\nthe fact that land must be purchased before the start of the standard manufacturing year is\nthus given by the sum of two terms.\nPVELP = OBL + PTAX\n\nwhere\nPVELP = present value of early land purchase\nOBL = accrued obligation due to early need for capital\nPTAX = accrued obligation due to early taxes on land.\nOBL = LAND * [(1 +k)Y-\n\n1\n\nwhere\nLAND = expenditure for land\n\nk = firm\'s after-tax cost of capital\nY = number of years from land purchase to the start of the standard manufac\xc2\xad\nturing year\n\nY-1\n\nPTAX = LAND *\n\nE\n\nt=l\n42\n\n(1 +,k)\n\nY :t\n\nwhere /3 = non-income tax rate, and the summation stops at Y - I because taxes are\nassumed to be paid near the beginning of the year after they become due.\nThese equations can be expressed in closed form as follows:\nLAND *3 *(Y-.1)\nFVL\n\nLAND\n\nifk=o\n\n1.0{(\n+{E) * [(I +k)y -1] -\'i>\n\nifk\n\n0\n\nPresent Value of Early Construction Costs\nAs with land values, facilities and equipment values are accounted for by the payments\nmade to the suppliers of capital. However, the fact that construction and installation costs\nare incurred before revenues begin leads to additional obligations to those capital sup\xc2\xad\npliers. In additionthere are property taxes and insurance premiums that must be paid,\nagain before revenues begin. [Release 1 of the SAMIS III computer program makes the\nfollowing simplifying assumptions: the same tax and insurance rates (not amounts) apply\nbefore the start of the standard manufacturing year as afterwards. All facilities construc\xc2\xad\ntion costs are incurred at the end of the first year of construction. All equipment costs are\nincurred at the beginning of the last year of construction.]\nThe submodel for calculation of the present value of early construction and installation\ncosts also generates an estimate of the investment tax credit savings accumulated. It is\nassumed that all of the available tax credit can be realized, either by carry-forward or by\nuse in a parent company.\nFacilities and equipment capital requirements are computed by de-escalation back to\nthe assumed time of occurrence. Insurance premiums are assumed to be paid at the begin\xc2\xad\nning of each year on escalated replacement values. Taxes are assumed to be paid at the\nend of each year on escalated values (depreciation does not start until the start of\nmanufacturing). Insurance and tax payments made on or after the start of the standard\nmanufacturing year are assumed to be included in the steady-state portion of the model,\nand are not treated as one-time costs.\nThe equations for the calculation of the present values are similar to those given above\nfor land, except that the sums are calculated explicitly to allow for the possibility of non\xc2\xad\nuniform escalation rates. (The book and tax values of land were assumed to remain con\xc2\xad\nstant at the purchase cost.)\nPresent Value of Early Working Capital Investment\nIt is assumed that all of the working capital is required at the start of the year contain\xc2\xad\ning the beginning of the start-up period. The dollar amount of working capital required is\ndeflated to that time. Additional dollar amounts are supplied at the start of each year un\xc2\xad\ntil the start of manufacturing to keep pace with inflation. As with land, facilities, and\nequipment, the amount of working capital supplied is not considered a one-time cost \xc2\xad\nonly the obligations to the suppliers of capital, insurance premiums, and non-income\ntaxes are.\n43\n\n\nPresent Value of Start-Up Costs and Revenues\nDuring the start-up period, process yields and production rates can be expected to im\xc2\xad\nprove until they approach their steady-state values. As a consequence, direct materials\nand supplies will be used at a different rate and revenues will be smaller than during\nsteady-state operation. Revenues will also be reduced due to the building up of the\nsteady-state inventory*. Revenues will be increased, on the other hand, by additional by\xc2\xad\nproduct income resulting from the increased scrap. (This increase is approximated by\nassuming all the by-product income normally obtained is from the sale of scrap. When by\xc2\xad\nproduct income normally results from the sale of actual by-products, the revenue during\nstart-up will be overestimated.) All expenses other than those of direct materials and sup\xc2\xad\nplies, on the other hand, will occur at about the same rate as during steady-state. The\nSAMICS submodel for start-up costs and start-up revenues reflects these considerations\n(Reference 4).\nSUC=(OPR+RPL+INS+OTX+INT+EQR+MIS-D +M*\nSUR =REV * (F * T S\n\n-\n\nF* D)*T\n\nS\n\nV) + BYP * F * (M - 1)* T S\n\nSAV= \tr* [(OPR+DEP +INS+OTX+INT+MIS-D+M*F*D)*TS-\n\nSUR]\n\nwhere\nSUC = \t total cost during the start-up period\nSUR = \ttotal revenue during the start-up period\nSAV = tax savings\nOPR = \tannual steady-state operating expenses\nRPL = \tannual steady-state capital replacement expenses\nINS = \tannual steady-state insurance premiums\nOTX = annual steady-state non-income taxes\nINT = \t annual steady-state interest on corporate debt\nEQR = annual steady-state obligation to holders of equity\nMIS = \t annual steady-state miscellaneous expenses (modeled later by the expres\xc2\xad\nsion MIS = x * REV + y * OPR + z * VALbook)\nD = annual steady-state direct materials and supplies expenses\n* Since the in-process inventory starts at zero and builds up to its steady-state value, one might ex\xc2\xad\npect a reduction in working capital requirements during start-up. The value of in-process invento\xc2\xad\nry, however, is the sum of the value of raw materials and the value added by labor. The value\nadded by labor is assumed to be applied at the same rate (per unit time) during start-up as during\nsteady-state operation, even though less of it winds up embedded in products being sold. To put it\nanother way, during the start-up period, an estimate of working capital requirements based on the\noperating expense rate is more meaningful than one based on the value of in-process inventory.\n44\n\n\nM = \taverage fraction, per unit of production, of steady-state direct materials\nand supplies rate required during start-up due to reduced yields (nominal\nvalue = 1.25)\n\nF = \taverage fraction of the steady-state production rate achieved during the\nstart-up period (nominal value = 0.635)\nTS\n\n=\n\nlength of the start-up period\n\nREV \t = annual steady-state total revenues\nV = \t steady-state inventory as a fraction of annual sales (nominal value\n\n=\n\n0.08)\n\nBYP \t - annual steady-state by-product income\nT = \t corporate\n\nincome tax rate\n\nDEP \t = annual steady-state depreciation.\nSAMICS assumes that these costs and revenues occur at the end of the year containing\nthe start of the start-up period. The net effect is a lossduring that period. This loss gener\xc2\xad\nates a tax savings, which can either be taken immediately by a "parent" company or car\xc2\xad\nried forward by the hypothetical SAMICS company. The amount of the tax savings is ap\xc2\xad\nproximated by the tax rate times the amount of the loss. Consequently, the net present\nvalue is given by the following equation.\nOTC = (SUC - SUR - SAV) * (1 + k) t m\n\n- t su\n\n*\n\nwhere\nOTC = net present value of start-up costs and revenues\nSUC, SUR, SAV, k, tm = as defined above\ntsu = the time of the start-up cash flows\n= deflator from t M to tsu.\n\nA complication has crept into the analysis: The annual expense rate, REV (which will\nequal the annual revenue rate as a result of the required revenue condition), has not yet\nbeen calculated. Hence, it is necessary to re-express this last result in a different form.\nOTC = CON + MUL * REV\nwhere\nCON = that portion of OTC that does not depend upon the total annual revenues\nMUL = that portion of OTC that does depend upon REV, divided by REV.\n45\n\nThese two constants are given by the following equations in terms of the variables defined\nabove.\nCON={EQR +RPL - T* DEP+(1 -r)* [OPR* (1 +y) +INS +OTX +INT\n+ z *VALbook-D* (I -M*\nt\n\n*TS\n\n*\n\nF)-F* (M-\n\n-t\n\n(I + k) t m -\n\nts u\n\nMUL = {(l -\n\nl)* BYP]}\n\n\'\n\n)* (x - F)* TS - V*\n\n(I + k) t m -\n\nt su *\n\n@D\n\nPresent Value of Depreciation to Steady-State\nAs discussed above, the firm\'s capital replacement expense, RPL, accounts for the\nreturn of the capital associated with the transition from all new capital goods to mixed\nnew and old capital goods. Obligations to the suppliers of capital, iisurance, and non-in\xc2\xad\ncome taxes, however, have only been calculated on the (smaller) steady-state depreciated\nvalue. In addition the depreciation of capital goods during this period of depreciation is\nlarger than during steady-state operations. The term PVDEPis the present value of these\nexpenses on the "excess" capital value during this period.\nThe actual phenomenon that takes place is quite complicated. Consider Figure 12,\nwhich illustrates the way capital values change with time. The dashed line shows the\nidealized situation in which the value of the facility decreases smoothly to zero over its\nlifetime, then jumps back to its initial value when it is replaced. (The "sawteeth" result\nfrom the same idealization of the value of the shorter-lived equipment.) Capital replace\xc2\xad\nment is actually a stochastic process, as suggested by the wiggly solid line. Neither equip\xc2\xad\nment nor facilitiesare all replaced at once. Eventually, the capital value will hover in the\nvicinity of the steady-state average depreciated book value, which was calculated above.\n\nThe SAMICS submodel of the variation of capital value with time is a straight-line\ndecrease from the initial value to the steady-state value, followed by the steady-state\nvalue itself, as indicated by the non-wiggly solid line in Figure 12. The period over which\nthis decrease takes place is controlled by-an input, the standard depreciationhalf lifefrac\xc2\xad\ntion, and runs from the start of the year in which construction ends until the end of the\nyear in which steady-state is "achieved".\n\nThe expenses that make up the contribution to one-time costs are, as mentioned above,\nnon-income taxes, insurance premiums, return on capital, and the income tax savings, all\non the difference between initial and steady-state capital.

Corporate Income Taxes\nCorporate income taxes are computed on the basis of the company\'s taxable income.\nThe taxable income is not equal to the return on equity for several reasons. First, the\nreturn on equity is defined as the after-tax return to the owners of the company. Second,\n48\n\n\nthe amortized one-time costs constitute a large expense (and consequently, by the re\xc2\xad\nquired revenue condition, a large contribution to taxable income) which is considered to\nbe paid to the suppliers of capital as a fulfillment of an obligation in addition to the\nsteady-state return on equity and interest on debt. Third, there are technical differences\nbetween actual expenses (such as replacement of capital) and tax-deductible expenses\n(such as depreciation).\nSince the taxable income depends upon the total annual expenses (by the required\nrevenue condition), which in turn depend upon the product price, the actual computation\nof corporate income taxes is performed within the iteration loop discussed in Section E,\nbelow. The submodel for that calculation is described here.\nTAX = tax(TI) - AITC - JTC\nwhere\nTAX = corporate income taxes (state and federal)\nTI = taxable income\n\ntax( ) = tax function (discussed in more detail below)\n\nAITC = actual investment tax credit taken\n\nJTC = job tax credit*.\nTaxable income is given by the following two equivalent equations.\nTI = REV - (OPR - JTC) - OTX - DEP - INS - INT - MIS\n- SALES + BYP - OPR - OTX - DEP - INS - INT - MIS + JTC\nwhere\nREV = SALES + BYP = total annual revenues\nSALES = revenue from sale of the company\'s products\nBYP = revenue from sale of by-products\n\nOPR = operating expense\n\nOTX = non-income (property) taxes\n\nDEP = deductible depreciation on capital goods\nINS = insurance premiums\n*See Reference 4. Calculation of the job tax credit is not yet implemented in the SAMICS\nmethodology, though the income tax submodel carries it, with a numerical value of zero.\n49\n\nINT = interest on corporate debt\nMIS = miscellaneous expenses (discussed in the next subsection).\n\nThe investment tax credit is almost known before entering this calculation, since a\nvalue for it was calculated along with the other capital-related expenses. However, tax\nlaws prohibit taking a credit larger than a specified* fraction of the total tax liability in\nany one year. Since the hypothetical SAMICS company operates in a steady-state, the fact\nthat the law allows carry-forward does not help, so the investment tax credit taken may be\nsmaller than the value previously calculated.\nThe tax liability (before subtracting tax credits) is computed by the tax function as the\nsum of state and federal taxes. Since state income taxes are deductible expenses on the\nfederal tax return, they are calculated first, then subtracted from the taxable income\nbefore federal taxes are calculated. Both tax calculations employ (input) tax rate tables.\nFederal tax, for example, is calculated** as follows.\n\n{0.20\n* RTI\n\nFED =\n\nif RTI < 25,000\n\n5,000 + 0.22 * (RTI - 25,000)\n\nif 25,000 < RTI < 50,000\n\n10,500 + 0.48 * (RTI -50,000)\n\nif 50,000 <RTI\n\nwhere\nFED = federal tax\'liability\n\nRTI = taxable income remaining after subtraction of state tax liability.\nSince the firm\'s cost of capital and generalized capital recovery factor depend on the\nactual average tax rate, they are recalculated after the tax has been computed. It is\nassumed, however, that the corrections to these two parameters would have a negligible\neffect on expense components already calculated (equipment payment float in Section C-I\nand one-time cost factors in Section D-5) and they are not recomputed***.\n7. Miscellaneous Expenses\nMiscellaneous expenses are those that are too small (but numerous) or too vague to\nidentify. The SAMICS methodology provides three parameters by which they can be\nspecified as fractions of the total annual expense, of the annual operating expense, of the\ndepreciated book value, or of any combination of these.\nMIS=x* REV +y*\n\nOPR+z* VALbook\n\n*This fraction is a SAMIS III input.\n"All of the parameters in this calculation are standard inputs.\n***The original computation used the highest marginal tax rates as if they were the average tax\nrates.\n50\n\nwhere\nMIS = annual mi\'ellaieodis\',exie"se\nREV = annial tevenue = total anrual iipense_\n\nOPR = annual operating expense\nVALbook = book value of equipment and facility capital\nx = company miscellaneous expense fraction of revenue (input)\ny = company miscellaneous expense fraction of operating expense (input)\nz = company miscellaneous expense fraction of book value (input).\nIf the hypothetical SAMICS company has a "parent" corporation that imposes a cor\xc2\xad\nporate overhead in addition to the required rate of returh on equity, that overhead can\nmost likely be costed by increasing one or more of these miscellaneous expense fractions.\nE. TOTAL ANNUAL EXPENSE ITERATION\nSome of the annual expenses (amortized one-time costs, income taxes, and\nmiscellaneous expenses) depend partly on the annual revenues, and the annual ievenues\nmust (by the required revenue condition) equal the sum of the annual expenses.\nIf the price-dependent expenses could be expressed in simple enough algebraic forms,\nsimple algebra could be used to find the total annual expense-and its component parts.\nThe tax function, however, is sufficiently complicated that an iteration procedure is used\ninstead. Initial values for the iteration are obtained by using the highest marginal tax rates\nin the state and fedbrdl tax rate tables as if they werethe avetage tax rates and by assum\xc2\xad\ning that the ifivestment tax credit is ndt affected by an upper bound. Each iteration re\xc2\xad\nquires very little calculation, and very few iterations are required.\nF. MANUFACTURED PRODUCT PRICES\nIf each firm were constrained to produce a single product, and if expense breakdowns\nby process were not of interest, product piices could be determined by simply dividing the\ntotal annual revenues (less the by-product income, if any) by the annual production quan\xc2\xad\ntity. However, since SAMICS is designed to be able to handle multiproduct firms, and\nprocess-by-process breakdowns are essential to the comparison of competing processes, a\nmore elaborate procedure is used: Total annual expenses for each work station (which do\nproduce single products) are determined, then divided by the work station\'s annual pro\xc2\xad\nduct quantity to obtain a work station product pice. This price is supplied to the subse\xc2\xad\nquent work stations that require the product, multiplied by the quantity required, and\nsummed to produce an implicit productcost. Thus, each work station implicitly (that is, no\nmoney changes hands), buys the products that it requires from within the firm, and im\xc2\xad\nplicitly sells its product to those work stations-viihin the firm that need it. When a work\nstation makes one of the firm\'s products, the price is inserted in the firm\'s product prices\nvector.\n51\n\n1. Allocation of Overhead to Work Stations\nWork stations\' direct and indirect expenses (and by-product income) are calculated by\nusing the firm\'s prices for all expense items (except facilities) and the work stations\' quan\xc2\xad\ntities.
