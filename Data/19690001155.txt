These c a p a b i l i t i e s have pot e n t i a l application i n other public and p r i v a t e f i e l d s . Rapid access t o\nthese c a p a b i l i t i e s through a systematized and consolidated reference f i l e\nwould have immediate benefits f o r NASA\'s procurement a c t i v i t i e s and would\nf o s t e r t h e diffusion of these new technologies throughout the f u l l range\nof p r i v a t e and public economic endeavor.\nThis report examines the f e a s i b i l i t y of a comprehensive, m u l t i user, NASA Contractors Capabilities Center and s e t s f o r t h some i n s i g h t s\ni n t o the technology application process. These i n s i g h t s can provide guidance t o designers and operators of formalized technology t r a n s f e r programs-such a s NASA\'s Office of Technology U t i l i z a t i o n .\n\nThe investigations were based on the premise t h a t a valuable and\nworkable Capabilities Center would have t o augment t h e e x i s t i n g , i n f o r n a l\nsystem of c a p a b i l i t y i d e n t i f i c a t i o n , expression, communication, and application. Therefore, selected N S contractors were interviewed t o define\nAA\nbroadly t h e types of c a p a b i l i t i e s they had developed, types of descriptive\ninformation required, major constraints t o be recognized i n design of the\ncenter, and opinions of contractors a s p o t e n t i a l suppliers of information\nt o the center and as p o t e n t i a l users of the output. Subsequent i n v e s t i gations sought s i m i l a r data from other user classes--primarily, d i f f e r e n t\ni n t e r e s t s w i t h i n NASA--and interpreted these findings both i n terms of\nCenter f e a s i b i l i t y and improved management of technology t r a n s f e r .\n\nSurvey Findings\nThe survey d i s c l o s e d t h a t contractors do not t y p i c a l l y i d e n t i f y\nor name t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s i n t e r n s of technical t a s k s or processes required\ni n the performance of contracts. Instead, they adopted an "outside" viewpoint and named c a p a b i l i t i e s i n terms of t h e item or service f i n a l l y del i v e r e d t o the buyer. I n t h e i r c a p a b i l i t y statements contractors a l s o i n cluded a number of nontechnical, organizational, and c o n t r o l procedures\nwhich the contractors believed were important i n the supplier selection\nprocess. Consequently, t h e process of c a p a b i l i t y i d e n t i f i c a t i o n and expression was found t o be extremely d i f f i c u l t and complex, and presented\nformidable conceptual and information processing problems. Among the spec i f i c findings were:\n\n1\n\n*\n\nContractors\' capabilities are identifiable, but they are not\nnecessarily identifiable in a form usefUl in a reference file.\n\n* Capabilities are not viewed in a technical frame of reference.\nThey are not defined as abilities to perform discrete technical tasks or\nnamed in accordance with required technical actions or described simply as\nmixes of technical resources.\n* Contractors see capabilities in market-oriented, company goalconditioned ways. Like all business, aerospace contractors must be concerned with perpetuating the firm and earning a profit. Capabilities are\naddressed to these ends and capability statements are an integral and important part of the marketing process. Within this limit, company goals\ncondition the visibility of capabilities, the importance attached to them,\nand the problems to which they are addressed.\n*\n\nCapabilities are mission-directed and organismic. Capabilities represent a combination of component elements having a value or utility\ngreater than the sum of the parts. They are assembled in response to an\nexpressed or implied need. Since they are tailor-made, an objective must\nbe specified prior to the development of a useful capability statement.\n\n*\n\nContractors have difficulty expressing their capabilities abstractly without a reference point. Even with a reference point, capability expression is a difficult task. As a result, contractors have evolved\na marketing procedure that is very personal, depends upon technical interfaces, and avoids explicit capability statement.\n\n*\n\nCapabilities are expressed in order of importance to market\nsuccess. Capabilities and capability components not important to the\nachievement of company goals tend to be ignored and are often not exploited.\n\n* Capability description often includes the following information: what we know how to do, how we control what we do, and the resources\nwe do it with. Contractors concentrate on making their capabilities known\nto present customers and often fail to see needs outside the aerospace\nmarket, to which their capabilities could be addressed.\n*\n\nDefinition of capability is conditioned by the nature of a\ncontractor\'s business--size of the firm, systems vs. components, research\nvs. production.\n\n2\n\nImplications f o r a Capabilities Center\nInformation characterizing contractors\' c a p a b i l i t i e s of a l l\ntypes could be handled w i t h i n a single general p u r p s e f i l e to serve the\nneeds of multiple users. Differences i n format and language of c a p b i l i t y\nstatements furnished by contractors do not necessarily render the information incompatible. Because of these differences,however, the input i n formation would require a d d i t i o n a l analysis and processing; t h e data f i l e ,\nindex s t r u c t u r e and terminology controls must be l a r g e r and more complex,\nand s p e c i a l routines f o r r e t r i e v a l would need to be developed.\nBroad, multi-purpose c a p a b i l i t y f i l e s do not appear j u s t i f i a b l e\na t the present time because such a center would involve costs, both to N S\nAA\nAA\nand to N S contractors, which outweigh t h e b e n e f i t s to most users over the\nmethods presently employed.\nA more specialized NASA Contractor Capabilities Center designed\nprimarily to support and enhance Technology U t i l i z a t i o n a c t i v i t i e s i s suggested a s a more a t t r a c t i v e a l t e r n a t e : a f i l e of r a r e or unique capabilities.\nAn inventory of NASA contractors\' c a p a b i l i t i e s representing novel,\nr a r e , new, or unique a b i l i t i e s to solve problems would both complement and\naugment Technology U t i l i z a t i o n Division e f f o r t s i n technology t r a n s f e r .\nSuch a " r e g i s t r y of r a r e c a p a b i l i t i e s " would a i d NASA i n f i v e areas:\n\na.\nb.\n\nc.\nd.\n\ne.\n\nMonitoring of technical needs;\nI d e n t i f i c a t i o n of innovations;\nDocumentation of s t a t e -of -the-art surveys, a s well a s\nindividual innovations;\nMatching of innovations or c a p a b i l i t i e s with needs;\nAssessment of b e n e f i t s from technology t r a n s f e r .\n\nTechnology Transfer Implications\nNASA\'s contractors are continually engaged i n developing, adapting,\naccepting, and u t i l i z i n g new technologies. The procedures which they have\nadopted; t h e i r views of ca-pabilities; t h e i r behavior w i t h respect to capab i l i t y development, application, and marketing; t h e constraints which a c t\nupon t h i s process; plus r e l a t e d matters--all have relevance f o r the enhancement of e x i s t i n g technology t r a n s f e r programs and the design of new approaches.\nHigh technology u t i l i z a t i o n leverage could be obtained through\nprograms providing t h r e e elements: ( 1) an i d e n t i f i e d non-space problem\nt o which c a p a b i l i t i e s can be addressed; ( 2 ) a s u f f i c i e n t incentive to make\n3\n\nt h e undertaking worthwhile ; and ( 3) an environment f a c i l i t a t i n g face-toface interchanges between t h e possessors of u n s a t i s f i e d non-space needs\nand possessors of aerospace induced c a p a b i l i t i e s . NASA\'s BiomedicalApp l i c a t i o n Team program i s one current e f f o r t that follows t h i s general apAA\nproach. There i s promise t h a t N S contractors can be encouraged t o play\nmore a c t i v e and d i r e c t r o l e s a s t r a n s f e r agents by programs based on\n"demand pull."\nOnly a f r a c t i o n of space contractors\' c a p a b i l i t i e s a r e reported\ne\nt o EASA under t h e provisions of the Nw Technology Reporting Clause. This\noccurs because few c a p a b i l i t i e s a r e developed s o l e l y f o r NASA and because\nc a p a b i l i t i e s a r e complex and a r e not viewed i n a way t h a t produces reportable "items."\nThus, consideration should be given t o programs t h a t encourage t r a n s f e r without going through e x i s t i n g technology reporting procedures.\nFor individual firms t h e cost of obtaining information about\nt r a n s f e r opportunities often deters application. Economies of scale can\nbe achieved by developing such information a t a single source and then\nd i s t r i b u t i n g it t o a l l p o t e n t i a l l y i n t e r e s t e d p a r t i e s .\nW conclude that t r a n s f e r programs concentrating on "demand\ne\npull" would e f f e c t i v e l y complement programs keyed t o "technology push."\nW recommend t h a t NASA, i n cooperation with other public agencies, p r i v a t e\ne\nassociations, and foundations, consider the development and dissemination\nof "non-space need" (market opportunity) information a s an inducement f o r\nt r a n s f e r . This could be done i n much the same m y that technology information i s now developed and disseminated.\nFinally, it appears that f o m a l technology u t i l i z a t i o n programs\ncan b e n e f i t from more knowledge about the normal process whereby technology\ne\ni s t r a n s f e r r e d and applied. W recommend f u r t h e r research on t h e process,\no f f e r a research framework hypothesis, and suggest s p e c i f i c types of i n vestigation.\n\n4\n\n1 .\n1\n\nA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBackground\n\nI n recent years NASA has levied many advanced requirements on\nAmerican i n d u s t r i e s . The response i n a l l f i e l d s - - s c i e n t i f i c , technological,\nmanufacturing, and management--is a matter of record. The success of t h e\nresponse i s a t t e s t e d t o by the successful completion of a number of NASA\nprograms and rapid progress i n other, even more advanced, programs. S a t i s faction of space exploration requirements has necessitated many state-ofthe-art advances which have been incorporated i n t o t h e s k i l l inventories\nof NASA\'s contractors and subcontractors.\nTo r e a l i z e the f u l l p o t e n t i a l of these new and augmented indust r i a l c a p a b i l i t i e s , N S has undertaken a number of steps t o f a c i l i t a t e\nAA\nf u r t h e r t h e i r application w i t h i n NASA\'s primary mission areas and t h e i r\nuse i n s a t i s f y i n g other public and p r i v a t e needs. T h i s report i s t h e\nproduct of one such step.\nIt presents the findings of a study t h a t explored the f e a s i b i l i t y\nof a Capabilities Center t h a t would catalog and provide reference services\nf o r the s p e c i f i c technical c a p a b i l i t i e s possessed by NASA\'s contractors and\nNASA was p a r t i c u l a r l y i n t e r e s t e d i n t h e reference\nt h e i r sub-contractors.\nc e n t e r \' s p o t e n t i a l a s a mechanism f o r furthering the application of space\ntechnology i n other f i e l d s . However, the Center was t o be designed t o serve\na broad range of N S and other users. Included among the p o t e n t i a l NASA\nAA\nusers who have need of c a p a b i l i t y information were the procurement o f f i c e s ,\nthe program o f f i c e s , the NASA centers, and of course, the Technology U t i l i zation Office, Other p o t e n t i a l users included government agencies, the\ncontractors themselves, non-aerospace industry which might make use of NASA\ncontractor c a p a b i l i t i e s , a s well a s other private i n t e r e s t s .\n\nB.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe study plan employed a two-phase research program. The f i r s t\nphase was a p i l o t survey of selected contractors t o define broadly the types\nof c a p a b i l i t i e s t o be cataloged, t h e types of descriptive information r e quired, and the major constraints which had t o be given recognition i n the\ndesign Center. Phase I l w a s t o progress t o t h e specification of design c r i t e r i a f o r the Center, including: the type or types of cataloging systems,\nthe data t o be provided w i t h respect t o each e n t r y indexed, controls on\naccess, the geographical location of the Center, and information on how the\nCenter might mesh with e x i s t i n g reference sources.\n\n5\n\nNine companies were surveyed during the course of Phase I. The\nsample was selected t o provide a mixture of l a r g e and small firms; prime\nand sub-contractors; and component, hardware, software, systems; and RSCD\ncontractors. A wide geographical d i s t r i b u t i o n of firms was a l s o sought.\nThe specific firms selected were: Arinc Research Corporation; Ball Brothers\nResearch Corporation; Electro-Optical Systems, Inc.; Excelco Development\nInc.; General E l e c t r i c Company Missiles and Space Systems Division; Gene r a l Precision, Inc. - Systems Division; Honeywell, Inc. - Aeronautical\nDivision; and Statham Instruments, Inc.\n\n-\n\nEach company was interviewed i n depth.\n\nTopics discussed included--\n\nb u t were not limited to--the following:\n\n1. The types of s p e c i a l c a p a b i l i t i e s t h a t the contractor had\ndeveloped or enhanced through NASA work.\nThe circumstances surrounding the achievement of these capaabilities--i.e.,\nwhy the c a p a b i l i t i e s were developed,\n2.\n\n3.\n\nOther NASA and non-NASA uses t o which these c a p a b i l i t i e s had\n\nbeen put,\nCurrent sources or methods used i n identifying the specialized\n4.\nc a p a b i l i t i e s of others and the a t t r i b u t e s and l i m i t a t i o n s of these e x i s t i n g\nsources.\n5. Opinions regarding the proposed Capabilities Center, including\na n assessment of t h e value t o the contractors (both a s suppliers of information and p o t e n t i a l users of the output), of experience with other f i l e s\nand r e g i s t e r s of c a p a b i l i t i e s , t h e i r willingness t o p a r t i c i p a t e , and problems\nor d i f f i c u l t i e s anticipated.\n\nThe interview findings disclosed a number of practices and tendenc i e s on t h e p a r t of contractors t h a t might severely r e s t r i c t the u t i l i t y ,\np r a c t i c a l i t y , and f e a s i b i l i t y of the o r i g i n a l l y planned Capabilities Center.\nMany of these f a c t o r s s t e m e d from the nature of "capability," as the cont r a c t o r s define the term. It turned out that contractors did not t y p i c a l l y\ni d e n t i f y o r name t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s i n t e r n s of technical t a s k s or processes\nrequired i n t h e performance of contracts. Instead, they adopted a n "outside"\nviewpoint--they named t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s i n terms of the item o r service\nthat they f i n a l l y delivered t o the buyer. They a l s o included i n t h e i r capa b i l i t y statements a number of nontechnical, organizational, and control\nprocedures which they believed were important i n the suppliers s e l e c t i o n\nprocess employed by buyers. Consequently, c a p a b i l i t y i d e n t i f i c a t i o n and expression w a s found t o be a n extremely d i f f i c u l t and complex process which\npresented both conceptual and information processing problems not o r i g i n a l l y\nconsidered, While NASA contractors were found t o possess a n impressive range\n6\n\nof c a p a b i l i t i e s , some of the unexpected findings--e.g., about t h e o r i g i n\nof new c a p a b i l i t i e s , the ways i n which contractors look a t t h e i r own capab i l i t i e s , and the question of whether c a p a b i l i t i e s a r e f u l l y exploited-AA\nindicated that the o r i g i n a l concept of a N S Contractors Capabilities\nCenter should be re-examined.\n\nC.\n\nPhase I1\n\nA s a r e s u l t of the findings, questions raised, and new opportuni t i e s suggested by t h e p i l o t survey, NASA\'s project monitors requested that\ne\ndesign planning f o r a Capabilities Center be postponed. Instead w were\nasked t o take a d d i t i o n a l s t e p s t o t e s t the v a l i d i t y and g e n e r a l i t y of t h e\nmajor hypotheses derived from the previous survey. This took the form of\na limited number of a d d i t i o n a l interviews and a review and analysis of r e l e vant l i t e r a t u r e . P o t e n t i a l N S users of t h e Center were a l s o contacted t o\nAA\nprovide t h e i r views on the u t i l i t y and d e s i r a b i l i t y of the Center. A f i n a l\nportion of the redirected study was aimed a t a n analysis of a number of\nfindings which promised a basis f o r b e t t e r understanding of the process\nwhereby technology i s u t i l i z e d i n new ways or applied t o new problems. Such\nAA\nan examination might lead t o new approaches t o the t r a n s f e r of N S technology and/or improved effectiveness i n e x i s t i n g Technology U t i l i z a t i o n Programs.\n\nThe balance of t h i s report s e t s f o r t h o u r findings with respect\ne\nt o the ways i n which contractors view t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s . W discuss both\nt h e implications of these views f o r the Capabilities Center, and the design\nof approaches t o speed t h e t r a n s f e r of technology.\nThe findings are presented i n four basic sections. The f i r s t i s\na review and expansion of Phase I findings. It lays t h e foundation f o r the\nfollowing sections.

Conclusions and recommendations a r e presented\ni n t h e F i n a l Section.\n1 1 SUMMARY O PHASE I FINDINGS\n1 .\nF\n\nThis section of the report presents a summary of the findings of\nPhase I. These findings form the basis f o r a l a t e r discussion of t h e imp l i c a t i o n s concerning the design of a successful Capabilities Center and i t s\np o t e n t i a l usefulness, as well a s suggestions r e l a t i n g t o technology-utilizat i o n program modification. The discuss-ion of each finding i s based, i n p a r t ,\non t h e findings of Phase I1 research.\n\nA.\n\nContractors Do Have I d e n t i f i a b l e Capabilities\n\nThe conclusion that contractors have developed impressive capab i l i t i e s , and that these c a p a b i l i t i e s can be i d e n t i f i e d , i s fundamental\n7\n\nto a l l others, and was not unexpected. However, t h e f a c t t h a t contractors have\ni d e n t i f i a b l e c a p a b i l i t i e s does not necessarily mean they are d i r e c t l y\ni d e n t i f i a b l e i n a form useful i n a Capabilities Center. I n most instances\nthe c a p a b i l i t i e s a r e not s t a t i c but are continually being developed and\nextended. N S programs and funding have played, and continue to play,\nAA\nimportant r o l e s i n t h i s process. However, only r a r e l y w i l l contractors\nadmit t h a t t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s are d i r e c t l y or s o l e l y traceable to NASA.\nMore t y p i c a l l y , c a p a b i l i t i e s a r e s a i d to have been brought i n t o being\nthrough a conzbination of company, NASA, A i r Force, and other government\nagency funding. To some extent, t h i s may r e f l e c t concern on the p a r t of\nthe contractors w i t h NASA patent p o l i c i e s , i . e . , i f the company can show\nthat sources of funding other t h a n N S were important i n the developAA\ngent of the capability, then i t may be able to r e t a i n a proprietary\np o s i t i o n o r patents associated therewith. Hawever, w do not believe t h a t\ne\nNASA\'s patent p o l i c i e s a r e a major consideration i n the reluctance of\ncompanies t o specify a s p e c i f i c source of the capability. Instead, it\nappears t h a t c a p a b i l i t y development i s an on-going and i n t e g r a l p a r t of\nbeing i n the space i n d u s t r i e s . Nw c a p a b i l i t i e s a r e most frequently s a i d\ne\nt o be the r e s u l t of corporate response t o a need i m p l i c i t (or e x p l i c i t l y\ns t a t e d ) i n t h e requirements of advanced government programs. Capabilities\na r e r a r e l y developed t o support any single requirement or to solve a\ns p e c i f i c technical problem encountered i n the course of a program. I n\nshort, c a p a b i l i t i e s a r e usually developed i n response to a recurring problem,\nor a problem t h a t i s generic to a number of programs which o f f e r s s i g n i f i c a n t\nmarket opportunity.\nAlthough more w i l l be s a i d on t h i s point l a t e r , c a p a b i l i t i e s a r e\nt y p i c a l l y composites. A c a p a b i l i t y i s not a f a c i l i t y , or a piece of equipment, or a p a r t i c u l a r s e t of s k i l l e d personnel. Instead, c a p a b i l i t i e s are\nsets of resources (including the preceding plus many others) t h a t are addressed t o some p a r t i c u l a r end. As a r e s u l t , it i s possible t o d i s t i n g u i s h\nbetween l a t e n t c a p a b i l i t i e s and c a p a b i l i t i e s i n being. For the l a t t e r type,\nthe outside s t i m u l u s of a n expressed or perceived customer need or simple\ncompetitive pressure has been applied to the company which i n t u r n r e a c t s\nby marshalling i t s resources ( i t s l a t e n t c a p a b i l i t y bank) i n t o a c a p a b i l i t y\ni n being\n\n.\n\nB.\n\nCapabilities Are Not Viewed i n a Technical Frame of Reference\n\nContractors do not define t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s i n terms of a b i l i t i e s\nt o perform d i s c r e t e technical tasks.

I n addition, few c a p a b i l i t i e s a r e\ndescribed i n terms of technical functions; instead, the focus i s on t h e\ncommodities delivered as end items.\n8\n\nThis lack of focus on the "technical" o r methodological aspects\nof capability, p a r t i c u l a r l y i n view of t h e importance of technical t a s k\naccomplishment i n aerospace industry, may seem surprising. The r e l a t i v e\nl a c k of emphasis on the technical aspects of t e c h n i c a l c a p a b i l i t i e s , however, i s a product of normal business behavior. Even though the contractors\ns e l l highly sophisticated, advanced technology goods and services to NASA\nand t h e defense establishments, the performance of technical tasks i s only\none of s e v e r a l types of a c t i v i t i e s that m u s t be accomplished s k i l l f u l l y i f\nthe f i r m i s t o be successful. A company\'s success i n the aerospace indust r i e s , a s i n other i n d u s t r i e s , requires the s a t i s f a c t o r y performance of a\nnumber of functions, including design, production, marketing, planning, and\ncontrol, finance, and d i s t r i b u t i o n . Elements of each o f these a r e included\nby contractors identifying t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s . This i s p a r t i c u l a r l y t r u e\nof adaptations they have made t o s a t i s f y the peculiar requirements of the\naerospace market. Thus, companies a r e p a r t i c u l a r l y aware of t h e i r s k i l l s\ni n scheduling, planning of complex operations, procedures f o r maintaining\nrapport w i t h the technical customer, and other s k i l l s supporting the del i v e r y t o the customer of t h e i r highly technical products or services.\nContractors often refused t o s t r e s s technical f a c t o r s i n describing t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s . Their response, i n e f f e c t , was: "You\'ve got it a l l\ne\ne\nwrong. I t \' s not t h a t anything w can make w can s e l l - - i t \' s t h a t anything\nw can s e l l , w can make.

Management i s responsible\n(and judged) f o r i t s a b i l i t y t o insure t h a t the company stays i n business\nand provides a t l e a s t a reasonable return t o the investor.

The product and t h e means of manufacturing and d i s t r i b u t i n g are a l l\nmeans t o the end: the s a l e , and ultimately the p r o f i t . The same holds f o r\nthe space i n d u s t r i e s .

Thus, c a p a b i l i t i e s are market-oriented and are perceived as being\nd i f f e r e n t from an i n t e r n a l - s k i l l s inventory of a company, which would focus\non elements and functions r a t h e r than on the r e s u l t i n g marketable product.\nThe i n t e r n a l - s k i l l s inventory i s not a capability statement, but r a t h e r a\nstatement of the pool of resources t o be drawn upon t o accomplish a technic a l task. The i n t e r n a l - s k i l l s inventory can be used t o work up a production\nplan, which i s one s t e p closer ko a capability: the plan represents a\nmarshalling and organization of resources t o accomplish a technical object i v e . But a production plan i s only one sub-set of a c a p a b i l i t y and the\ntechnical objective i s not the ultimate objective. A capability a l s o includes contributions from a l l the other normal business functions--marketing, d i s t r i b u t i o n , finance, management, support services, etc.,--formed t o\nproduce\' s a l e s and provide p r o f i t s .\nNot a l l companies are motivated s o l e l y by economic f a c t o r s . A t\nl e a s t three of the companies w talked t o were strongly impelled by none\neconomic forces, and saw t h e i r reason f o r being--and obtained t h e i r s a t i s factions from being--at the f r o n t i e r s of science and technology. But even\ni n these cases the economic r e a l i t i e s placed powerful constraints on what\nthey undertook and haw they went about t h e i r work. Even these f i r m s which\nwere predisposed t o view t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s i n a limited technological way\nwere forced t o view and express t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s i n a market-oriented way.\nWithin the broad context of a market-oriented view of c a p a b i l i t i e s ,\ncompany goals a f f e c t the v i s i b i l i t y of c a p a b i l i t i e s possessed by a firm,\nthe importance attached t o them, and the problems t o which they are addressed. For example, one company saw i t s e l f as b a s i c a l l y a s c i e n t i f i c ent e r p r i s e . It sought research and development contracts, sometimes followed\nby limited production of t h e resulting hardware. It did not seek volume\nproduction contracts. I n f a c t , fromtime t o time it had diverted t o other\norganizations several products which had reached t h e volwne production s t a t e .\nThe company had strong p o t e n t i a l manufacturing c a p a b i l i t i e s , but these were\nnot exploited because such exploitation would have been i n c o n f l i c t w i t h\nb a s i c company goals. The manufacturing s k i l l s were regularly employed i n\nthe conduct of t h e i r operations--but they were viewed as supporting skills.\nBecause\'the f i r m d i d not view i t s e l f as a manufacturing company, major market\nor goal changes would be required before these manufacturing s k i l l s could be\ndeve,loped i n t o a major capability.\n\n10\n\nAnother company viewed i t s e l f as a high-technology, component\nsupplier, and avoided R&D contracts which might t a i n t i t s patent position.\nThe d i f f e r i n g goals of t h e two companies produced r a d i c a l l y d i f f e r e n t views of t h e c a p a b i l i t i e s . I n addition, the two companies aimed\nt h e i r marketing e f f o r t s a t two d i f f e r e n t customer segments. The f i r s t\nmaintained extensive contact w i t h research buyers , and the second concent r a t e d on hardware buyers.\n\nD.\n\nY\n\nCapabilities Are Mission-Directed and Organismic\n\nContractors do not view t h e i r s k i l l s a s c a p a b i l i t i e s u n t i l they\nare gathered together t o s a t i s f y some mission. I n addition, c a p a b i l i t i e s\nare a combination of component elements with a value o r u t i l i t y g r e a t e r\nthan the sum of the p a r t s . I n our discussions w i t h various contractors,\nw t r i e d very hard t o g e t the interviewees t o reduce t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s to\ne\nfundamental elements t h a t are d i s c r e t e , e a s i l y named, functional, and conse quently comparatively easy t o catalog o r index. Contractor representat i v e s inevitably r e s i s t e d t h i s kind of c a p a b i l i t y formulation. They cons i s t e n t l y expressed t h e i r c a p a b i l i t y at a higher l e v e l than the process\nelements, f a c i l i t i e s , knuwledge, organization, e t c . For example, w would\ne\nattempt t o get an o p t i c a l instruments manufacturer t o express h i s capabili t i e s i n terms of designing, generating, and f i g u r i n g o p t i c a l elements,\nprecision machining, assembling, collimating, and t e s t i n g . His response,\nhowever, would be t h a t h i s company\'s c a p a b i l i t y w a s " s t e l l a r navigation\ndevices." By so responding, contractors were t e l l i n g us a t l e a s t three\nthings :\nF i r s t , c a p a b i l i t i e s e x i s t at a higher, more complex l e v e l than\nthe component elements t h a t must be combined t o produce a capability.\nSecond, an objective must be specified before a c a p a b i l i t y can\nbe assembled. This means t h a t s k i l l s f o r which there a r e no known needs\n(markets) are not capabilities--because t o the contractor the c a p a b i l i t i e s\nmust be salable. Either the customer must s t a t e t h a t he has an u n s a t i s f i e d\nneed, o r the company m u s t perceive t h a t the customer has an unsatisfied\nneed, before t h e contractor can assemble the capability. The putting-together of a c a p a b i l i t y depends upon where a contractor s t a r t s . Assembly\ncan inclpde a l l o r some of the following: (a) focusing upon and mentally\nidentifying a p o t e n t i a l capability, (b) generating and naming a capability\nwhich speaks t o t h e market need by r e l a t i v e l y minor a l t e r a t i o n s of an\ne x i s t i n g c a p a b i l i t y and/or ( c ) a c t u a l mobilizing and organizing a new\nc a p a b i l i t y from a resource bank plus t h e a c q u i s i t i o n of new c a p a b i l i t y\nelements from outside the company.\n\nFor confirmation, see: Howard Reiss and Jack Balderston, "The Userulness\nof S c i e n t i s t s , I \' Internat5onal Science and Technology, May 1966, pp. 38-44,\n\n11\n\nThird, the components o r elements of c a p a b i l i t y a r e not limited\nt o technical s k i l l s alone, but a l s o include the s k i l l s necessary t o g e t\nthe business i n t h e first place, and then t o organize and control t h e application of the technical s k i l l s t o the achievement of the market-defined\nmission.\n\nE.\n\nContractor\'s View of Capabilities Defines Behavior\n\nBehavioral c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of contractors stem from t h e i r view\nof capability, and even more fundamentally from the forces t h a t shape t h e i r\nviews of capability. These behavioral c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s have a number of\ns i g n i f i c a n t implications f o r the Capabilities Center and f o r the design of\ntechnology-transfer programs.\n\nI. Contractors have d i f f i c u l t y expressing t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s\na b s t r a c t l y without a reference point. To some extent t h i s i s a result of\nthe sheer abundance of t a l e n t possessed by many contractors. More important,\nthe way they do business ( i . e . , assemble t h e i r t a l e n t s t o s a t i s f y a s p e c i f i c\nneed) does not require t h a t they l e a r n haw t o state c a p a b i l i t y a b s t r a c t l y .\nFinally, general l i s t i n g s of elemental s k i l l s which make up c a p a b i l i t y are\nnot compatible with the organismic nature of capability. Dissecting a\nc a p a b i l i t y i n t o i t s p a r t s may make the c a p a b i l i t y unrecognizable and would\nc e r t a i n l y undervalue it. For example, Statham Instruments has a r a r e\nc a p a b i l i t y i n Thin Film Transducer Technology. The major technical elements\nmaking up t h i s c a p a b i l i t y are:\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nSubstrate f i n i s h i n g t o o p t i c a l surface quality,\nMultiple vacuum deposition--dielectric ceramic, s t r a i n gage\na l l o y , and lead elements,\nUltra-precise lead-wire welding,\nIntegrated e l e c t r o n i c s ,\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nAccelerated aging and s t a b i l i z a t i o n techniques,\nMaterials know-how--alloys,\n\ns e a l s , , a n d d i e l e c t r i c s , and\n\nPerformance of these operations a t a microminiature scale.\n\nAlthough somewhat sophisticated, none of these elements i s unique. HMever,\nt h e i r combined application t o transducers i s : t h e transducer produced repr e s e n t s a r a d i c a l departure from t r a d i t i o n a l s t r a i n gage design and product i o n ; and the performance i n t e r n of precision and operating environment\ni s dramatically improved.\n\n12\n\nThe d i f f i c u l t i e s associated with a b s t r a c t c a p a b i l i t y statements\ncause the contractors t o view with alarm requirements imposed on them by v a r i ous governmental customers f o r before-the-fact, nonproject r e l a t e d , o v e r a l l\nc a p a b i l i t y statements. Several agencies now require such statements. The\ncontractors f e e l t h a t they are not used; that they a r e r e a l l y not usable;\nt h a t there i s much duplication; and they c e r t a i n l y do not want t h i s study\nto r e s u l t i n another system having the same f a u l t s .\n2. Even with a reference point, c a p a b i l i t y expression i s a\nd i f f i c u l t t a s k . The complex nature of c a p a b i l i t y makes t h i s t h e case. The\nf a c t t h a t reference points (Requests f o r Proposals and the l i k e ) a r e often\nsomewhat vague i s a f u r t h e r complication. Contractors believe t h a t they\nmust read between the l i n e s t o i d e n t i f y w h a t the buyer r e a l l y wants and then\nform the c a p a b i l i t y statement accordingly. Further proof of t h e d i f f i c u l t y\nof the t a s k i s found i n the v a r i e t y of crutches used by contractors i n discussing t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s . They r a r e l y make a single statement such a s ,\n" O u r capability i s\n." Instead they w i l l continue w i t h , "By t h a t I\nmean\nand w have applied t h i s c a p a b i l i t y t o the following programs\ne\n. . *,\n,\n, i n the past." Description i n terms of the output\nfrom a c a p a b i l i t y (the r e s u l t i n g product) i s an even more common means of\ncircumventing an e x p l i c i t c a p a b i l i t y statement. Finally, the meaningful\nexpression of c a p a b i l i t y seems to require that the presentation be made\nto a technically q u a l i f i e d audience.\n\n...\n\n. . . .,\n... ...\n\n3. Contractors have evolved a marketing procedure which i s very\npersonal, depends upon technical i n t e r f a c e s , and avoids e x p l i c i t c a p a b i l i t y\nstatement. I n t h i s process both buyer and s e l l e r are represented by technic a l people. The s e l l e r \' s representative continually c u l t i v a t e s t h e buyer\'s\nrepresentative i n an attempt to keep abreast of the buyer\'s requirements\nlong before s p e c i f i c WP\'s a r e issued. I n f a c t , t h e interchange of informat i o n between the two i s reputed to be a s i g n i f i c a n t a i d to the process\nwhereby the buyer determines exactly w h a t tasks he wants t o undertake.\nAll contractors indicated t h a t t h i s c u l t i v a t i o n w a s absolutely necessary\nto t h e i r continued success. I f they waited f o r the issuance of an RFP, they\nbelieve t h a t t h e i r chances of g e t t i n g t h e job a r e s l i m .\nThe i n t e r a c t i o n between technical representatives of the buyer and\ns e l l e r i s s a i d to work l i k e t h i s : Using t h e i r technical backgrounds, the\ntwo a r e able to discuss e x i s t i n g hardware c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s and t r a n s l a t e\nthese i n t o modifications and advances required t o perform the new mission\nwhich t h e buyer has i n mind. From t h i s background the s e l l e r \' s man d r a w s\ni m p l i c i t conclusions as to the c a p a b i l i t i e s required to accomplish the job,\no r produce the new piece of hardware. Then, he draws examples from h i s\ncompany\'s past hardware work t h a t demonstrate the company\'s c a p a b i l i t y t o\nsupply t h e desired item. The buyer\'s man then judges the company\'s capabili t i e s by t r a n s l a t i n g the tendered hardware examples back i n t o capability.\n13\n\nAgain, the t r a n s l a t i o n i s i n t u i t i v e . Note t h a t t h i s process avoids the\nd i f f i c u l t t a s k of e x p l i c i t l y foraulating and presenting c a p a b i l i t y s t a t e ments, and t h a t t h i s i s accomplished through a close personal interface\nbetween members of the technical f r a t e r n i t y .\nBefore the contract i s l e t , a l l the formal w r i t t e n s t e p s a r e of\ncourse taken. But a l l contractors surveyed believe t h a t t h i s i s laxgely\na f t e r the f a c t ; i . e . , the buyer has l a r g e l y made up h i s mind about who i s\nb e s t q u a l i f i e d t o g e t the job based on previous discussions.\nNone of the contractors surveyed believed t h a t t h i s personal\nphase of s e l l i n g ( c a p a b i l i t y presentation) could be replaced by a computerbased Capability Center. However, a l l indicated t h a t the e x i s t i n g process\nwas expensive and wished t h a t something could be done t o assist the process\nand thus cut c o s t s .\n\n4. Contractors express t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s i n order of importance\nt o market success. This tendency i s very important because it can often obscure t r u e technical c a p a b i l i t i e s . TRW Systems finds i t s p r i n c i p a l capab i l i t y i s t o mobilize and manage a bank of resources (primarily expressed as\npeople i n a broad range of s p e c i a l t i e s ) t o y i e l d an operating payload hardware system of a b o s t any type the customer requests. A l l t h e i r wealth of\ntechnical s k i l l s a r e subordinate t o t h i s o v e r a l l c a p a b i l i t y .\nARINC Research Corporation indicated t h a t i t s most important single\nc a p a b i l i t y was i t s i m p a r t i a l i t y and l a c k of b i a s ; more e x p l i c i t l y i t s a b i l i t y\nt o t r u l y and objectively represent t h e i n t e r e s t of i t s customers. This i s\nobviously a nontechnical f e a t u r e , b u t given the type of work done by the\ncompany, it i s of fundamental importance i n g e t t i n g business. ARINC Research\noperates f o r i t s governmental customers as a s t a f f expert i n systems effectiveness. When so contracting f o r i t s government customers, i t s position i s\nanalogous t o t h a t of the Aerospace Corporation except t h a t the area of exp e r t i s e i s narrower. Violation of confidences tendered by e i t h e r the customer o r the company, whose product o r processes were being examined from a rel i a b i l i t y viewpoint by ARINC Research, would be disastrous t o the f u t u r e of\nARINC Research. If confidence and i n t e g r i t y a r e not maintained, the company\nwill not get t o apply i t s recognized strong a n a l y t i c a l t e c h n i c a l c a p a b i l i t i e s .\n\nB a l l Brothers Research Corporation and another f i r m stress t h e i r\nc a p a b i l i t i e s i n systems management and systems engineering because of customer\ninfluences b u t f o r a-somewhat d i f f e r e n t reason than ARINC Research. I n the\ncase of these two companies, t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s i n the above areas came about\nas "fixes" which were necessary t o improve t h e i r market positions. Ball\nBrothers Research s t a r t e d out q u i t e small, grew rapidly, and f i n a l l y found\nt h a t coherency of e f f o r t was jeopardized under the then e x i s t i n g organization.\nThe company therefore reorganized on a program basis so as t o , p r o v i d e a subs t a n t i a l l y b e t t e r framework f o r systems management. The ohher firm, a t r a d i t i o n a l supplier of r a t h e r sophiqticated components t o the a i r c r a f t industry,\n\n14\n\nfound that it was losing sales as the aircraft industry evolved into the\naerospace industry. The apparent reason was that the marketing game had\nchanged as the demands of aerospace placed more emphasis on integrated\nsystems. Thus, to sell components, the firm was forced to move into systems engineering. Both companies feel that these adaptations to the market\nhave added significant--perhaps vital capabilities.\n5 Contractors tend to ignore or fail to exploit capabilities\n.\nand capability components that are not important to the achievement of\ncompany goals. Statham has a number of processing capabilities that are subordinate and necessary to its overall Thin Film Transducer Capability. However, it would be unlikely for the company to actively seek business in one\nof these areas unless the new business area was consistent with the company\'s\ngoals or market missions.\n\nOur visit to Electro-optical Systems was made just after its acquisition by the Xerox Corporation--before Xerox goals and market philosophy had pervaded the organization. Company goals still mirrored the interests and motivations of EOS\'s founder, Dr. Abe Zarem--one of this nation\'s\noutstanding scientists. The company viewed its great strengths as being\nin basic scientific phenomenological research and subsequent development\naddressed to the problems associated with unmanned spacecraft. Time and\nagain during the interview at EOS, examples were called out wherein items\nwith market potential had been carried through the small lot production\nstage, and then either abandoned, or a manufacturing subsidiary created to\nexploit the more mass market. The reason given in each case was that EOS\nwas not a manufacturing company; its strength lay elsewhere; and consequently it did not intend to dilute its effort by engaging in off-the-shelf\nmanufacturing.\nNow, two years later, the goals of EOX have been markedly altered\nthrough a combination of Xerox ownership and market pressure, i.e., the research market has contracted and the military hardware market has expanded.\nMajor changes in the company\'s view of its capabilities and their application have followed. EOS retains its research excellence but this is not\nan end in itself. Today, emphasis is on the manufacture of operational\nhardware in high obsolescence mass market areas. Scientific 1 research is\nconducted in support of this manufacturing function.\nHoneywell is another example. This firm has explicitly carved\nout areas of primary interest to the company and established goals in each.\n\n1\n5\n\nAll company activities are geared to attaining these goa1s.g Such a policy\nexemplifies the excellent management and control for which Honeywell is\nwell known and is obviously beneficial to existing customers (they can\ncount on the maintenance and further development of the \\capabilitiesthey\nbuy from Honeywell), but it also inhibits the acceptance of unplanned for,\ntangential, walk-in-the-door business to which Honeywell\'s capabilities\nmight be addressed.\nAs the preceding illustrations indicate, company goals exert a\npowerful influence on a company\'s view of its capabilities. In many cases\nthis view severely inhibits the application of capabilities in new 1 areas.\nHowever, this limitation is not so strong that it cannot be overcome, if\nsufficient market potential is demonstrated to warrant goal reevaluation.\nSuch was the case with Statham in its move into medical instrumentation\nand electronics. Market forces were also important in the Electro-Optical\nSystems product line shift, But the companies do appear to be reluctant\nto respond to one-time, tangential business for their subordinate capabilities such as might be referred to them by the Center.\n6. Contractors include nontechnical as well as technical factors\nin describing their capabilities. Examples of this tendency at ARINC and\nBall Brothers were noted earlier. The reason is that nontechnical factors\noften control who gets the contract--particularly when the choice is among\nrelatively technical equals. Thus, 1 the survey showed that a relatively\ncomplete capability description would include the following types of information:\n\na. What we know how to do: This would be the technical\nheart of the capability. An example would be Statham\'s Thin Film Transducer Technology. In this portion of the description the general field\nis named. It would probably be followed by hardware proofs citing examples of past applications of the products produced by the capability.\n\nI\n\nHow we control what we do: This information includes\nstatements about management, company organization, systems know-how, quality\nassurance, documentation, and so on. All are nontechnical but all are\nimportant to getting and keeping business.\nb.\n\nFor more on this approach and a description of the techniques employed\n)\nsee: \\ Lawrence I . McGlauchlin, "Long Range Technical Planning,"\nHarvard Business Review, July-August 1968, pp, 54-64.\n16\n\n\'\n\nc. Resources w do it with: People, f a c i l i t i e s , equipment,\ne\nand finances a r e general classes of resources c a l l e d out i n t h i s p a r t of the\nI\nstatement. They a r e the ultimate building blocks out of which both t h e\ntechnical and nontechnical aspects of c a p a b i l i t y are constructed.\nThe upshot i s that there a r e a number of required marketand buyer-imposed f a c t o r s t h a t keep contractors from focusing upon t h e i r\nelemental o r functional technical s k i l l s .\n7. Contractors concentrate on making t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s known\nt o e x i s t i n g customers. This i s because t r u e c a p a b i l i t y expression i s\nd i f f i c u l t and expensive. Companies n a t u r a l l y address t h e i r e f f o r t s i n t h i s\nregard t o e x i s t i n g customers where they already have t h e i r foot i n the door\ni n order t o maximize the return. Also, they know t h e needs o f e x i s t i n g\ncustomers and a r e organized to parshal t h e i r s k i l l s t o serve these needs.\n8. Contractors often f a i l to see needs that e x i s t outside of\naerospace t o which t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s could be addressed. The reason i s\nthe concentration on e x i s t i n g customers. Thus, application of c a p a b i l i t i e s\nt o problems outside the aerospace market usually a r i s e s because the person\nw i t h the need stumbles across t h e company with the capability. This was\ne s s e n t i a l l y t h e case i n t h e two most dramatic t r a n s f e r instances found i n\nthe surveys.\n\nStatham\'s move i n t o medical instrumentation was i n i t i a t e d by\nmedical researchers with a problem. The medical researchers were located\na t Wright Field and Statham had a n operation there. A s a r e s u l t of t h i s\nproximity, t h e doctors learned of Statham\'s c a p a b i l i t y and asked t h a t it\nbe applied t o t h e i r problem. B a l l Brothers\' manufacture of computer memorycore planes f o r IBM began i n much t h e same way. IBM moved i n t o Boulder,\nColorado, and sought l o c a l sub-contractors.

Since\ncontractors view t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s i n an organismic and a mission-directed\nmanner, they a r e not l i k e l y t o perceive opportunities t o apply i s o l a t e d\nskills, and a r e less l i k e l y t o a c t i v e l y seek 0u.t new applications f o r such\nskills.

NASA\'s contractors and t h e i r subcontractors\nare not a homogeneous group. There i s no such t h i n g as a t y p i c a l aerospace\nf i r m . There a r e a t l e a s t three types of differences among firms which cond i t i o n t h e statement of capability.\n10.\n\n-\n\nSize: Generally speaking, smaller companies can formulate\nmore e x p l i c i t c a p a b i l i t y statements than large companies can.\nSystems vs. components: Contractors primarily engaged i n\nsystems management and systems engineering experience more d i f f i c u l t y i n def i n i n g t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s than do producers of components. The reason i s\nt h a t t h e systems company has fewer tangible benchmarks t o employ as\ndescriptors.\nb.\n\nAnother aspect of t h i s problem i s t h a t many systems firms\na l s o do some component work. I n f a c t , they may do the same type of component work a s a specialized component su3contractor. But the systems firm\nprobably w i l l not view h i s component s k i l l s a s a s i g n i f i c a n t capability.\nObviously, t h e subcontractor w i l l see h i s component c a p a b i l i t y as highly\ns i g n i f i c a n t . T h i s c h a r a c t e r i s t i c i s an impediment t o complete disclosure\nof the universe of c a p a b i l i t i e s possessed by NASA\'s contractors.\ne. Research and services vs. production: I d e n t i f i c a t i o n of\nc a p a b i l i t i e s possessed by contractors primarily engaged i n e i t h e r of these\na c t i v i t y areas encountered problems similar t o those i n the system vs. components case.

These c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s are associated\nwith the description of c a p a b i l i t i e s f o r purposes somewhat removed from\nthe procurement s i t u a t i o n (toward the r i g h t side of Chart 2).\nThe reason, w believe, i s t h a t newly born a b i l i t i e s have not\ne\n"What our\nyet become s e t i n the mold of a corporate c a p a b i l i t y ( i . e\ncustomers ask us f o r " ) ; the contractors s t i l l tend t o regard these accomplishments as "components" of some f u t u r e marketable capability.\n\n.,\n\nThe functions performed and the means of accomplishment receive\nmore a t t e n t i o n than does the market served. This emphasis may r e s u l t from\nthe c a p a b i l i t y being new; managers may not yet know many of the ultimate\napplications t h a t could be developed.\nThe very nature of highly d i s t i n c t i v e c a p a b i l i t i e s o f f e r s one\nsimple means f o r validating the c a p a b i l i t y as described: ask who e l s e\npossesses comparable o r nearly equal a b i l i t y . Two firms suggested t h i s\nstraightforward way of checking. They indicated t h a t f i r m s a t the foref r o n t of new technology can usually name t h e i r closest competitors i n some\nspecialized area o f s k i l l or accomplishment. If two groups do not recognize\neach other a s technical front-runners, it probably means t h a t the c a p a b i l i t y\nof one is so new t h a t knowledge of it has not spread, o r t h a t there may be\nreason t o question the v a l i d i t y of one s t a t e d c a p a b i l i t y .\nNewly developed c a p a b i l i t i e s which have been demonstrated t o be\nunusually successful occupy a peculiar position w i t h regard t o contractor\nwillingness t o disclose information about the a b i l i t y . I n the speculative\nstage when the contractor i s not sure how f a r the application of the capab i l i t y can be c a r r i e d , or i n t o what markets, management was r e l a t i v e l y\nopen and eager t o discuss t h e i r c a p a b i l i t y . After a corporate decision\nhas been reached t o pursues f u r t h e r development and apply the c a p a b i l i t y t o\nsome defined market, the cloak of secrecy i s l i k e l y t o decend. I B M o f f e r s\na s t r i k i n g example of t h i s behavior applied curiously enough, not t o a\nproduct o r a technical process, but t o a r e l a t i v e l y "soft" capability--the\nmethodology f o r d e t a i l e d technical mission analysis and economic j u s t i f i c a t i o n . Management believes t h i s c a p a b i l i t y t o be so valuable t h a t the group\nwhich has received awards and national recognition for i t s accomplishment,\n.\ni s severely limited i n discussing the new and outstanding capability.\nI n most cases, however, contractors are completely w i l l i n g t o make\nknown t h e i r unique c a p a b i l i t i e s . V i s i b i l i t y and understanding by others\noften lead t o new and p r o f i t a b l e applications.\n\n32\n\nV.\n\nA.\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR TECHNOLOGY-UTILIZATION PROGRAMS\n\nContractor Views of Capability Provide Insights I n t o Technology\nUtilization\n\nAlthough t h i s research program was s p e c i f i c a l l y targeted a t the\nf e a s i b i l i t y of a contractor Capabilities Center, o w investigations d i s closed a number of features associated with c a p a b i l i t i e s - - t h e i r development ,\napplication, marketing, and acceptance--that have implications f o r a broad\nrange of technology-utilization questions.

NASA\'s contractors a r e i n the\nbusiness of developing, adapting, accepting, and u t i l i z i n g new technologies.\nThe procedures they have adopted i n the conduct of t h e i r business; t h e i r\nviews of t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s ; t h e i r behavior w i t h respect t o c a p a b i l i t y development, application, and marketing; the constraints which a c t upon t h i s\nprocess; plus other r e l a t e d matters--all have relevance f o r technology\nutilization.\nAn examination of t y p i c a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the c a p a b i l i t y de-\n\nvelopment and application process discloses f e a t u r e s t h a t have positive\ne f f e c t s on technology diffusion and features t h a t impede such diffusion.\nE x p l i c i t recognition of these f a c t o r s i n the design and operation of technology u t i l i z a t i o n programs w i l l provide greater leverage per unit of\ne f f o r t than might otherwise be obtained.\nThe s p e c i f i c insights arid implications called out i n the following\ndiscussion were developed from our interviews, and are generally supported\nby the l i t e r a t u r e on t h e subject.\n\nB.\n\nInsights Can Be Used t o Enhance Existing Technology U t i l i z a t i o n Programs\nand t o Design N w Approaches\ne\n\n1. Problem o r Application I d e n t i f i c a t i o n : O u r analysis indicates\nt h a t the g r e a t e s t technology-utilization leverage can be obtained by the\ni d e n t i f i c a t i o n of non-space problems t o which c a p a b i l i t i e s or space developed technologies can be addressed. Just about every c h a r a c t e r i s t i c\nassociated with t h e c a p a b i l i t y formation and buying process supports t h i s\nAA\nview. Given a N S problem statement i n the form of a s p e c i f i c Request f o r\nProposal or even a broad mission statement like--"Placethree men i n space\nf o r t e n days, support them, and recover them"--contractors do an excellent\njob of assessing the technical requirements, forming the necessary c a p a b i l i t y\nfrom t h e i r pool of resources, and then organizing and managing the c a p a b i l i t y\nt o achieve the s t a t e d objective.\n\n33\n\n-\n\n~~\n\n-\n\n----\n\n-\n\nOur findings indicate t h a t a c a p a b i l i t y w i l l not be formed u n t i l\nthe need f o r it i s perceived by the contractor possessing the r e q u i s i t e\ns k i l l s , And, a c a p a b i l i t y cannot be applied u n t i l it has a buyer. The\np o t e n t i a l buyer must recognize t h a t he has a need, and t h a t a c a p a b i l i t y\ncan be applied t o satisfy the need. On the other hand, the s e l l e r must\na l s o recognize the need, and recognize t h a t he has or can form an appropriate capability.\nA s a buyer of technologies, NASA has exploited these characterisAA\nt i c s o f the capability-application process. N S has analyzed i t s space\nmissions to determine t h e i r technical requirements and then widely disseminated these needs to p o t e n t i a l contractors, who i n t u r n respond by forming\nthe necessary c a p a b i l i t i e s , which they apply upon contract award.\n\nThis same general approach has g r e a t u t i l i t y i n promoting the\napplication of NASA-induced technology to non-space applications. I n f a c t ,\nt h e Biomedical Applications Teams already ]follow t h i s approach. F i r s t ,\nmedical problems a r e i d e n t i f i e d . Then, routes to solutions a r e sought from\nthe body of NASA-developed technology. The EAT concept a l s o provides f o r\nadaptation of the technologies t o t h e new medical use. Extension of t h i s\napproach to ( o r i n t e n s i f i c a t i o n of e x i s t i n g a c t i v i t i e s i n ) other pressing\ne control, transportation,\nproblem areas (e.g., a i r and water pollution,\nurban reconstruction , e t c ) holds high promise.\n\n.\n\nIncentive: Although problem i d e n t i f i c a t i o n i s a necessary\nprecondition for c a p a b i l i t y formation, the c r i t i c a l event t h a t m u s t take\nplace before c a p a b i l i t y application i s the provision of incentive t o do so.\nIncentive can take many forms. Important among these a r e s c i e n t i f i c\nc u r i o s i t y , engineering t e n a c i t y when confronted with an unsolved problem,\nand money. The f i r s t two forms of incentive a r e very important, b u t the\nsupply i s r e l a t i v e l y fixed i n the / s h o r t run by the number of people a v a i l able with these motivations. There i s l i t t l e t h a t the Office of Technology\nU t i l i z a t i o n can do d i r e c t l y to enlarge the number of these people available.\nB u t NASA can exploit the money incentive--more properly, NASA can! indicate\nthe market p o t e n t i a l available from t h e solution of i d e n t i f i e d non-space\nproblems. Given a defined need and a n associated a t t r a c t i v e market, aerospace resources (technologies) do g e t applied /to non-space problems. This\noccurs i n much the same way and f o r the same reasons that these resources\nwere e a r l i e r applied to N S problems.\nAA\n2,\n\nSeveral such e f f o r t s of t h i s tyye are now under way. For example, one\ninvolves the cooperative e f f o r t s of NASA (Office of Technology U t i l i zation) , Department of I n t e r i o r ( Federal Water \\Pollution Control Admin\n.on) , and MpI ( Biomedical" A-&J.i..-t&ns\nTeam) :34\n\nA t l e a s t two of the firms w interviewed made s i g n i f i c a n t moves\ne\ni n t o non-space markets. These moves were made using modifications of\nA AD D\nc a p a b i l i t i e s developed t o meet N S / O demands. Technology was transferred,\ndespite the f a c t t h a t both firms saw themselves as almost exclusively space\nand defense contractors. They responded t o the new marhts when the nonspace opportunities were communicated t o them i n the form of technical\nrequirements o r needs, and when the market p o t e n t i a l was demonstrated t o be\nworth the bother. Because the firms were focused on t h e i r e x i s t i n g customers,\nt h e impetus f o r t h e t r a n s f e r s came from t h e non-aerospace buyer i n both cases,\nand the i n i t i a l encounters were almost accidental. The experience of these\ntwo firms does o f f e r proof t h a t aerospace firms can and w i l l adapt t h e i r capab i l i t i e s ( t r a n s f e r technology) when presented with an a t t r a c t i v e opportunity.l/\nObviously, not every f i r m w i l l be able t o adapt i t s c a p a b i l i t i e s t o s a t i s f y\nAA\nevery non-space need, but i f N S were t o make available information on nonspace needs t o aerospace firms (and others) i n a systematic and formal way,\nthe environment f o r technology t r a n s f e r would be enhanced. Given non-space\nmarket need and market p o t e n t i a l information, r a t i o n a l business behavior on\nthe p a r t of contractors should--at a minimum--make t r a n s f e r opportunity\nassessment a routine r a t h e r than exceptional experience.\n3. Technology Possessor/Technology User Rapport: Effective capab i l i t y expression and communication require a high degree of f a m i l i a r i t y\nand i n t e r a c t i o n between buyer and s e l l e r . A l l contractors interviewed believed that "te chnical ink imacy" - -but not ne ce s sari y personal intimacy- -is\nrequired i f they are t o market t h e i r c a p a b i 1 i t i e s . d To s a t i s f y t h i s r e quirement contractors focus t h e i r marketing e f f o r t s on e x i s t i n g customers\nt o the p o t e n t i a l exclusion of other capability-application opportunities.\nIndeed, the way contractors view t h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s i s a d i r e c t outgrowth\nof the needs of e x i s t i n g customers. Latent c a p a b i l i t i e s t h a t might be\naddressed t o the needs of new customers are r a r e l y recognized by contractors.\n\nr/\n\n"The key step, especially f o r an innovation that spins off t o non-milit a r y , non-NAXA sectors of the economy, i s industry\'s r e a l i z a t i o n of\nthe opportunity p o t e n t i a l , No matter how powerful the other factors,\nif industry does not see any benefits over and beyond the government\napplications, the innovation will see limited use and a narrow market."\nHerbert S. Xleiman, "A Case Study of Innovation," Business Horizons\n( W i n t e r , 1966) pp. 63-70.\nFor more on t h i s point see: Edward B. Roberts, "The Myths of Research\nManagement," Science and Technology, No. 80, (August 1968) ,=pp. 40-46.\n\n35\n\nThe implication for TU from this is that the inducement of contractors to apply their skills in non-space fields requires not only information about market identification and market magnitude, but also potential\nnon-space customer identification and contact. NASA can take a number of\nsteps to lower the non-space customer identification and buyer-seller familiarity barriers. One such step would be working conferences addressed to\nsome particular non-space problem (some aspect of the air pollution control\nproblem, for example) at which representatives of aerospace firms would\ndiscuss with potential buyers--government and private--the problem and solution approaches. NASA\'s role could take several forms: it might be\nlimited to encouraging such experiments, it could include conference format\nsuggestions, or it might include joint sponsorship with relevant mission\nagencies or private associations. In any event, such encounters would also\ndo much to reduce the barriers to transfer posed by the different "languages"\nspoken in aerospace and other industries. Our findings and TU\'S experience\nindicate that "language" is a significant impediment to transfer.\nThe Office of Technology Utilization Works with the Tip of\nthe Capabilities Iceberg: Even the small sampling of NASA contractors\ninterviewed in this study disclosed an impressive number of new, important,\nand useful capabilities concerned with new techniques, new products, new\nmanagement concepts, manufacturing controls, materials know-how, and all\nthe other factors which go to make up "space technology.\'\' Observation and\ncomparison convinced the investigators that many of the capabilities encountered were significantly advanced over counterpart skills and capabilities found in non-aerospace industry. But relatively few of these contractor capabilities are made known to the Office of Technology Utilization.\nThere are several reasons why this is so, and these will be\' discussed more\nfully. But first, the implications for NASA\'s technology utilization activities should be discussed. NASA should give consideration to whether some\npresently unreported contractor-developed capabilities should be identified\nand documented f o r TU and whether there are appropriate and effective ways\nto do so. In addition, it appears that some of these capabilities can never\nbe documented effectively, yet are still potentially transferable. Consideration should be given to TU actions that would stimulate transfer without\ngoing through the steps of documentation and reporting to NASA.\n4.\n\nThe reasons why capabilities are not reported have relevance for\nthe design of new capture methods and transfer stimulation actions. Only a\nsmall fraction of the capabilities were developed solely in the performance\nof NASA contracts. More typically, capabilities come into being as a result\nof a combination of NASA, DOD, and company sponsorship. Since most capabilities are not directly traceable to NASA funding, they are not reported under\nthe New Technology Reporting Clause. Perhaps more important, contractors\njust do not look at their capabilities in a way that would produce reportable\n"items," Instead, they see them as composites of talents and resources\n36\n\nrequired t o d e l i v e r the product t o the customer, Everything i s viewed i n\nt h e context of the job a t hand. A s a r e s u l t , new, novel, and unusualtechn i c a l solutions a r e often overlooked because " t h a t \' s t h e way any good engineer would do it i f he were working on this problem." Proprietary i n t e r e s t s a l s o l i m i t reporting t o NASA. It i s our opinion t h a t proprietary i n t e r e s t s r a r e l y intervene i n t h e reporting process as a r e s u l t of malicious\ni n t e n t . Instead, it i s a noma1 desire t o exploit--on one\'s own--a discovery\nwith market promise. When t h i s s i t u a t i o n occurs, a t r a n s f e r has occurred,\neven though it d i d not happen through formal Tu mechanisms and was not reported t o RASA a s a t r a n s f e r achieved.\nThe f i n a l reporting impediment stems from the f a c t t h a t many capab i l i t i e s amount t o nothing more than a p a r t i c u l a r company\'s being f a r t h e r\nalong the "learning curve" than anyone e l s e .

The Cost of Information: The cost of obtaining i n f o m t i o n\ndetermines i n p a r t whether newly developed c a p a b i l i t i e s w i l l be exploited.\nThe extent and r a t e of t r a n s f e r of c a p a b i l i t i e s t o new uses or new markets\nlikewise may be limited by the cost of information.\nSix of t h e companies interviewed had developed i n t e r e s t i n g new\ntechnical c a p a b i l i t i e s , but had not yet been able t o make a corporate determination whether they should pursue f u r t h e r e x p l o i t a t i o n of these a b i l i t i e s\nand attempt t o f i n d new markets and new applications f o r t h e s k i l l s .

Contractors focus on learning about the needs of e x i s t ing customers (NASA and DOD), on forming information packages about how\nt h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s can meet these needs, and then on communicating this i n y\nformation t o NASA and DOD.

This information i s then disseminated\ne\nto a broad audience of p o t e n t i a l technology acceptors who, i n t u r n , may apply\nthe new technology toward the solution o f a non-space problem within the cont e x t of a conventional marketing framework. This process involves a t l e a s t\nfour major p a r t i e s , i . e . , the contractor who o r i g i n a l l y developed the technology, BASA, the non-aerospace acceptor of t h e technology, and t h e ultimate\nnon-aerospace buyer of the f r u i t s o f t h e new technology. I n addition, the\nprocess has a numberof stepswhich m u s t be performed, important among which\nare: t h e perception t h a t the technology i s worthy of reporting, the reporting of the technology to NASA, t h e screening of the report by NASA, t h e d i s semination by N S , t h e acceptance of the technology by the r e c i p i e n t , t h e\nAA\nadaptation of the technology t o the new use, t h e marketing of t h e new technology or i t s f r u i t s , and f i n a l l y , the decision to buy by the ultimate user.\n6.\n\nThe t r a n s f e r of technology requires t h a t there be change.

W a\nht\nt h i s amounts to i s a program to induce NASA contractors to adapt and apply\nt h e i r c a p a b i l i t i e s toward the solution of non-space problems. I n such a\nscheme, both NASA and the non-aerospace acceptor of the technology would\ndrop out of d i r e c t p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n the t r a n s f e r process.

Some of the f a c t o r s r e l a t i n g t o the technology\ns e l l e r are: the f i r m must perceive t h e market opportunity; the f i r m must\nadapt to the requirements of serving the new market, i . e . , discard organizat i o n a l and procedural c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s it acquired to serve t h e N M A market\nand adopt new c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s required t o serve the new non-aerospace market;\nthe firm must revise i t s view of i t s e l f and i t s objectives; and t o accomplish\na l l these t h i n g s , t h e f i r m should be provided w i t h incentive t o do so.\nOrganizational f a c t o r s r e l a t e d to the technology buyer are essent i a l l y the reverse of those associated w i t h the technology s e l l e r . The\ntechnology buyer must perceive the technologies required i n serving i t s\nmarket, p a r t i c u l a r l y with respect t o emerging market needs and new technolog i c a l ways of s a t i s f y i n g these needs. It must adapt procedures, organizat i o n s , and s o on to accommodate the new technologies. It a l s o must revise\nits view of i t s e l f and i t s goals. And it must have the incentive to undertake these steps, i . e . , s i g n i f i c a n t new market p o t e n t i a l .\n\nI i s our view t h a t t h i s hypothesis provides a s t a r t i n g point\nt\nf o r an examination of the r o l e s of these three elements and t h e i r subelements i n the technology u t i l i z a t i o n process. Tests of the hypothesis\nshould provide a structured understanding of the process, i d e n t i f y those\npoints i n the process where g r e a t e s t leverage can be obtained by technology\nu t i l i z a t i o n stimulating programs, and provide experience with various p r a c t i c a l techniques f o r exerting leverage.\nVI.\n\nA.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND R C M E D TO S\nEC MN AI N\n\nRecommendations Concerning Implications f o r Technology U t i l i z a t i o n\n\nA s a r e s u l t of our findings concerning t h e nature of c a p a b i l i t i e s\nand our analysis of t h e associated implications f o r Technology U t i l i z a t i o n ,\nw make t h e following recommendations:\ne\n1. E f f o r t s to develop c l e a r e r understandings of the technologyt r a n s f e r process, which the Office of Technology U t i l i z a t i o n i s attempting\nto a c t upon, should be continued. W e suggest that a structured framework\nf o r such s t u d i e s i s available from our hypothesized description of the\n\n46\n\ntransfer process (p. 39) plus the conceptual systems model of technological\ninnovation recently developed by Ellis Mottur .r/\n2 Efforts to identify interesting, new, unique capabilities\n.\npossessed by NASA contractors are in order, When identified, some of these\ncapabilities should be subjected to study to establish how they came into\nbeing. The scope of these investigations should include the timing, investment, and decision-making factors associated with the development and\nexploitation of the capabilities. An objective of these studies should\nbe to determine ways to expand the small fraction of capabilities now reported to TU for dissemination, Critical incident analysis would be an\nexcellent methodology for these investigations.\n\nMost important, the "demand pull" approach to Technology\nUtilization should receive great emphasis. Existing programs following this\napproach should be augmented, and new programs should be put into effect.\nIn general, the approach requires the identification of non-space problems\n(transfer opportunities), market-potential estimation, and dissemination of\nthis information to both potential users and possessors of aerospace-developed\ncapabilities\n( See pages 30 through 36 for specific action suggestions. )\n3.\n\n.g\n\nThe Office of Technology Utilization should take steps to involve\nother mission agencies, industry associations, and foundations in a series\nof programs to implement this recommendation. These steps would be in addition to the Office\'s current technology identification and dissemination\nfunctions. The analytical techniques developed by Dr. Peter Castrucio for\nthe ORL Experimental Program provide a model methodology for the conduct of\nTo the extent possible the market\nthe market-identification function\n( non-space transfer opportunity) information should be disseminated through\nexisting channels.\n\n.g\n\nf\nl\n\nEllis Mottur, The Processes of Technolopica1 Innovation: A Conceptual\nSystems Model. a study sponsored by the National Bureau of Standards\nand U S Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (forthcoming).\n..\nDr.\'Donald M. MacArthur has also called for and outlined a program of\nthis type.

The current t r a n s f e r e f f o r t s\nassociated with the Rockwell-Standard/North America Aviation merger provide an excellent s p e c i f i c case-study opportunity.\n\n9\n\nB.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations f o r a NASA Capabilities Center\nConcerning establishment of a Capabilities Center the investiga-\n\ntors conclude :\n1 Broad purpose Multi-Client Capabilities F i l e s present d i f f i .\nc u l t i e s and costs which outweigh the present need f o r such centralized\nsystems.\n2. The nature and format of c a p a b i l i t i e s information used ( a )\nf o r nw-procurement purposes and (b) to locate r a r e o r scarce skills, while\nd i f f e r i n g i n form and content, could be made compatible i n an associative\nfile.\n\n3 . Attempting to combine i n the same f i l e the r e l a t i v e l y well\nstandardized c a p a b i l i t i e s t h a t a r e s t a t e d , c l a s s i f i e d , and coded f o r procurement purposes w i t h more specialized descriptions of unusual o r unique capab i l i t i e s would g r e a t l y enlarge the f i l e s i z e , and introduce c o n f l i c t s i n\nsearching procedures\n\n.\n\n4. Any NASA contractor-capability f i l e created to serve Technology\nU t i l i z a t i o n should be designed and developed f o r t h a t audience and i t s purposes of use alone; not f o r program o f f i c e s or other agencies, and assuredly\nnot f o r procurement use. Usage of such a f i l e by Technology U t i l i z a t i o n\nwould be primarily oriented toward monitoring the emergence, and the spreading of aerospace technology, and toward association of technology and needs.\n\n5. To be p r a c t i c a l , a Technology U t i l i z a t i o n Division f i l e of\nc a p a b i l i t i e s should be kept small and highly specialized. This constraint\ni s suggested i n p a r t because of the experimental nature of the index coding,\nf i l e s t r u c t u r e , and associative searching methods which would be needed.\nEven more compelling, however, i s the need of the TU d i v i s i o n to be concerned\nw i t h p e r h p s the t o p one percent of tednnological capabilities--that on t h e\nleading edge of change.\n\n1/\n\nSee: "Piping Technology Toward Nw Goals," Business Week, July 27, 1968,\ne\npp. 108-112.\n48\n\n6. The most a t t r a c t i v e and p o t e n t i a l l y useful form of contractor\nc a p a b i l i t i e s f i l e appears to be one concerned exclusively with novel, rare,\nnew, or unique a b i l i t i e s t o solve problems. A s e l e c t i v e f i l e indexing i n\nAA\ndepth, perhaps no more than 3,000 c a p a b i l i t i e s of from 500 to 1,000 N S\ncontractors, i s envisioned.\n\n7 . Building a f i l e of unique, r a r e , or new c a p a b i l i t i e s would\nrequire types of information not now available i n inventories of conventional\ns k i l l s or procurement f i l e s . However; it i s _worth noting that a t t h e 1 s t\nof newly evolved capability-injbeing, most contractors a r e w i l l i n g t o supply\nthe necessary information on request. This i s e s p e c i a l l y t r u e where the\norganization possessing a new c a p a b i l i t y i s not sure how or whether i t s\nf u r t h e r e x p l o i t a t i o n f i t s t h e i r company goals and markets.\n8.
