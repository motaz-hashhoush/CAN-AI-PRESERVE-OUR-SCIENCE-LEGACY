Hayes, University of Michigan\n\nSolar Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer\nThe solar extreme ultraviolet spectrophotometer (EUVS)\nwill measure the spectral distribution of intensity in the\nwavelength range extending from 140 to 1,850 Angstroms. The\ninstrument consists of 24 monochromators, 12 of which will\nrecord intensities at certain fixed wavelengths Which are\ncritical to studies of atmospheric structure and to an understanding of mechanisms of dissipation of the input radiant\nenergy. Each of the remaining monochromators will scan a\nlimited wavelength range to give, in total, complete coverage\nof the 140 to 1,850 A region.\n.\nInvestigator:\n\nH.E.

(for orbit and attitude verifications) will be stripped out and the remaining data transmitted to the central processor.\n<\n\nData Processing and Analysis^ Plan\nIn order to optimize the scientific return and achieve\nmaximum utilization of the variable orbit capabilities of\nthe AE spacecraft, an on-line central processing analysis\nsystem is provided for performing the majority of data reduction and analysis for the investigators and theorists which\ncomprise the Aeronomy Team. Providing short turn-around times\n(one to several days) on analysis of selected aeronomy problems will permit adaptive mission planning while the spacecraft is in approximately the same location. For example/ the\nAeronomy Team may want to study a particular latitude in the\nnorthern hemisphere at a perigee of 150 km (90 mi.) during a,\nhighly disturbed condition for three consecutive days after\nnoting the condition existing during a one day low perigee\nexcursion. The adaptive planning will be made possible by\nmeans of the fast turn-around analytical capability within\nthe central processor. The whole spacecraft may, thus, be\noperated like a laboratory instrument.\n\n-more-\n\n-21-\n\nAE-D/DELTA TEAM\nNASA Headquarters\nDr. Noel W.
