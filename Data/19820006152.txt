Reinhard\nSpace Science Department of ESA\nEuropean Space Research and Technology Centre\n2200 AG Noordwijk, The Netherlands\nPreface\nWhen the "Workshop on Modern Observational Techniques for Comets" was held the Giotto\nscientific payload had not yet been selected and I presented the model payload. The following\npaper appears in an updated form to include the actual payload as selected in January and\nFebruary 1981 by the Selection Committee and the Science Working Team.\nAbstract\nESA\'s Giotto mission to Halley\'s comet is the "remnant" of a much more ambitious joint\nNASA/ESA mission involving a Halley fast flyby in 1985 and a Tempel 2 rendezvous in 1988, a\nmission which could not be carried out because the necessary low thrust propulsion system was\nnot funded by NASA. After briefly reviewing the Giotto mission background various comet\nselection criteria are given and it is explained why Halley\'s comet is by far the most\noutstanding target for a flyby mission.\nThe mission scientific objectives are given, followed by a somewhat more detailed\ndescription of the 10 Giotto scientific instruments. The principles are explained on which the\nexperiments are based, and the experiment key performance data are summarized.\n"Mission analysis" focusses on the launch constraints, describes the heliocentric transfer\ntrajectory and, in more detail, the encounter scenario. The Giotto spacecraft major design\ncriteria are explained leading to a brief discussion of the spacecraft subsystem. The ground\nsystem design as an integral part of the mission is described. Particular attention, finally,\nis drawn to the problem of hypervelocity dust particle impacts in the innermost part of the\ncoma and the problem of spacecraft survival, and the adverse effects of impact-generated plasma\naround the spacecraft.\n1.\n\nMISSION\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn 1974, the European Space Agency (ESA) performed a mission definition study on a cometary\nflyby mission of comet Encke in 1980. After review by the ESA scientific advisory bodies no\nfurther studies were performed on the mission because it was felt that the scientific return\nfrom the short flyby was not consistent with the cost of the mission.\nA cometary mission, however, remained in the Long Range Planning report of the Solar System\nWorking Group (1976, 1978) as a possible component of a programme of "planetary" research. An\nad hoc Panel, chaired by H. Fechtig, was set up to formulate more precise proposals for a\ncometary mission. This\'Panel organized a Workshop on "Cometary Missions" at the European Space\nOperations Centre (ESOC), Darmstadt on 17-19 April 1978. The purpose of the Workshop was to\ninvolve a cross-section of the interested scientific community in Europe in providing\nsuggestions for the orientation of future study and planning work. Subsequently, the Panel\nasked the Solar System Working Group to recommend a mission definition study covering the\nfollowing two items:\n(1) A participation of ESA in a NASA rendezvous mission,\n(2) An independent ESA ballistic mission, of the multicomet type, including Halley, Encke,\nTempel 2, and possibly C-type asteroids.\nIf NASA decides to go ^ahead with the rendezvous mission, the ESA ballistic mission is\nconsidered as a complementary rather than as a competing mission. The various payloads are\nopen for US and European Experimenters.\n284\n\n"If NASA would postpone the rendezvous mission, ESA should go ahead with an independent\nballistic mission."\nAfter further review and discussion by the scientific advisory bodies, ESA accepted the\ninvitation extended by NASA to study a participation in the cometary mission then under study\nby NASA. This mission involved a rendezvous with Tempel 2 during its apparition in 1988, and a\nfast flyby of Halley at 1.53 AU pre-perihelion at the end of 1985. ESA\'s share of the project\nwas envisaged as the provision of a purely passive probe to be released from the NASA main\nspacecraft ~ 15 days before Halley encounter and to be targeted at the nucleus. NASA\'s share\nof the project was the provision of the main spacecraft and the solar electric propulsion\nsystem (SEPS), which is a necessary element for a comet rendezvous mission, with the\nannouncement in January 1980 that the required funding for SEPS was not included in the US\npresident\'s budget it had to be acknowledged that the basis for a cooperative mission no longer\nexisted.\nAs an immediate replacement ESA presented the HAPPEN (Halley Post-Perihelion Encounter)\nmission, proposed earlier by G. Colombo, to its scientific advisory bodies. The idea was that\nthe Geos-3 spacecraft, a derivative of the Geos 1 and 2 spacecraft and instrumented for\nEarth-magnetotail research, should be retargeted, at the end of its magnetotail mission, to\nintercept the tail of Halley\'s comet. This mission, however, was not recommended for further\nstudy.\nIn response to suggestions from the scientific community ESA also examined another option\nconsisting of two spacecrafts based on the Geos concept launched simultaneously by Ariane. One\nspacecraft (Geos-3) was to perform an Earth-magnetotail mission, the other (Giotto) was to be\ninstrumented for cometary research and to intercept Halley as close to the nucleus as possible.\nAt its meeting in early March 1980 the Science Programme Committee (SPC) decided:\n(1) that the GEOS-3 part of the combined mission should not be studied further,\n(2) to pursue the study of a mission to Halley\'-s comet, including all possibilities of\ncooperation with NASA, and\n(3) that the total cost to ESA for the comet Halley mission should not exceed 80 MALI\n(~ 80MJ).\nIn view of the limited time remaining before the next apparition of Halley\'s comet ESA\ndecided not to consider totally new mission or spacecraft concepts. NASA was invited to\nconsider providing a Delta launcher and use of the Deep Space Netweork (DSN) in return for an\nappropriate share of the scientific payload.\nConsequently the Giotto study proceeded with the following constraints\no low cost project\no based on a Geos design\no launched either by an Ariane rocket in a launch shared with an "applications"\nsatellite or by a Delta rocket.\nThe study was completed in May 1980 and presented to the scientific community and the ESA\nscience advisory bodies. Giotto was strongly recommended and the SPC at its meeting on 8 and 9\nJuly 1980 decided that Giotto should be included in the ESA programme as the next scientific\nproject.\nSince at the time of the SPC decision there was no commitment from NASA to provide the\nDelta launcher or the DSN in return for an appropriate share of the scientific payload the SPC\napproval had to be based on an Ariane launcher. Any later offer of NASA to provide the Delta\nLaunch Vehicle and the DSN would require a new decision by the SPC to change the launcher.\nWhen this offer finally came in late October 1980 the SPC considering all elements of the offer\npreferred to maintain the Giotto mission in its originally approved version, i.e., launch by\nAriane, but was pleased to see a substantial number of US investigators involved as Co-Is in\nthe candidate European experiment proposals.\n\n285\n\nSince Giotto formally never reached the status of a cooperative ESA/NASA project, ESA could\nnot, for reasons imposed on ESA by the council, invite US\'investigators as Pis. A "Call for\nExperiment Proposals" was sent out in July 1980 to interested European investigators,\nimmediately after project approval with a deadline for submission of proposals by 15 October\n1980. The proposals were technically assessed for compatibility with the spacecraft and\nscientifically reviewed by a Selection Committee. The final payload complement was announced\nin mid-January 1981. Following instructions by the SPC, the payload was further completed at\nthe first Science Working Team (SWT) meeting in mid-February 1981. The following chapters\ndescribe the Giotto project and its scientific payload as of mid-February 1981.\n2. COMET SELECTION CRITERIA\n2.1 Scientific Criteria\nBased on their orbital periods, comets can be categorized as short-periodic (with periods\nbetween 3 and 25 years), intermediate-periodic (25-200 years), long-periodic (200-106 years),\nand "new" comets. The most active and therefore brightest comets are the new ones, comets that\nhave never previously approached the sun. Ideally, then, one would like to rendezvous with a\nnew comet, but this is presently impossible. Firstly, such a rendezvous calls for a continuous\nlow-thrust propulsion system, e.g., solar electric propulsion, and no such system is currently\nunder development. Secondly, to plan a mission to a comet, its orbit must be well known, which\nmeans that the comet must have returned at least a few times. This rules out new comets and\nleaves only the short-periodic and a few intermediate-periodic comets as candidates.\n\n-\n\n\xc2\xa3 \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n^\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n12\n\nQ\nD\nt 11\nZ\n\n_\n\n0\nvo\n\nSOLUTE M\n\nO\n\n: H\n*\n\nCD\n\n<\n\n- .1\n\n8\n\n,\n6 -\n\n6\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nUJ\n\n_\n\n.*\n\nQ\nD\nt\nZ\nO\n\n<\n\nv\n\n-\n\nt\n\nca\n<\n\ni\nBRIGHTNESS DECREASE\n" OF COMET HALLEY\n\n4\n\n_\n1\n\n,\n\n,\n\n1795\n\n1852\n\ni\n\n1901\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\n-\n\n0\n\n-\n\n-1\n\n-\n\n-\n\nAD\n\n-239\n\n-\n\nI\n1\ni\n\n-2\n\n1954\n\nI\n\n.\n\n* \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1\n\n-\n\nr\nI\n\n-\n\n5\n\n1\n\n-\n\nJ\n\n\xc2\xbbT\n\ni\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n7\n\n5\n\n7\n\nSOLUTE M\n\nUJ\n\n8\n\n1\n\nBRIGHTNESS DECREASE\nOF COMET ENCKE\n\n14\n\n13\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ni\n\nL*>\n\nl\n\nK>\n\n1J\n\n451\n\n1066\n\n,\n1910 AD\n\nFigure 1. Apparent brightness decrease of periodic comets Encke and Hal ley. The early\nobservations of Hal ley are very doubtful but for Encke there appears to be a clear\ntendency for the brightness to decrease. (Data from Vsekhsvyatskii, 1964).\nComets that have returned to the inner solar system several times build up dust layers on\ntheir surface because the dust carried away by the gases is pushed back by solar radiation\npressure. This simplified mechanism could explain why comets, on the average, tend to decrease\nin brightness with each return. Figure 1 shows as an example the brightness decrease of comet\nEncke for which most data exists and also some estimates for comet Halley according to the\ntable by Vsekhsvyatskii (1964). All short-periodic comets are considerably less bright than\nnew comets, and they produce two orders of magnitude less gas and dust (see Table 1).\n\n286\n\nTABLE 1.\n\nCOMPARISON OF HALLEY WITH OTHER COMETS\n\ngroup\n\ncomet\nEncke (1990)\nTenpel 2 (1988)\nTuttle - Giacobini - Kresak (1990)\nHonda - Mrkos - Pajdusakova (1991)\nFaye (1991)\n\n\' short\nperiodic\n, comets\n\nmission\ncan be\nplanned\n\nm\n\n12-13\n\xe2\x80\xa2\\. 13\n12\n13-14\n11-12\n\n. intermediate periodic\nmission\ncan not\nbe planned\n\nHalley (1986)\n\nf long periodic\n< or\n[ "new" comets\n\nTago - Sato - Kosaka (1969)\nBennett (1970)\nKohoutek (1973)\nWest (1976)\n\nm\n\n,,\nti~\n\n\\0 at 1 AU\n\no\n\n3- 1027\n1. 1027\n.1-1027\n.1-1027\n,1-1027\n\n1-1029\n\n5\n6.4\n3.5\n6.0\n5.0\n\n2- 1029\nOQ\n2.5-10\n1.5- 1029\n2.3-1029\n\n- absolute total magnitude\n- production rate (H.O molecules per sec)\n\n| As Table 1 (reproduced from ESA SCI(80)4, 1980) shows comet Halley 1 s absolute magnitude and\ngas, production are similar to those of long-periodic or "new" comets.

Schwassmann-Wachmann\'s actual brightness is very much smaller than Halley\'s\nbecause its perihelion distance is 5.5 AU (nevertheless, because of its occasional flaring up\nat the large distance from the Sun Schwassmann-Wachmann is a very exciting target for a cometary\nmission). In summary, Halley is in fact the most outstanding comet. Considering furthermore\nthat Halley has reappeared at least 29 times and that it might have been even brighter still\n2000 years ago than it is today (Figure 1) it is conceivable that Halley is significantly\nlarger than the "average" comet and "worth a visit".\n2.2 Technical Criteria\nBoissard et a]_. (1981) have published a few more technically oriented criteria for\nselection of ITtarget comet. These are:\no\n\na reliable orbit should be available, in order to predict the ephemerides of the comet\nwith sufficient accuracy;\n\no\n\nthe recovery of the comet should occur well before the encounter (at least 100 d),\nsince the calculated ephemerides should preferably be adjusted with new observations;\n\no\n\nthe comet should be visible from the Earth at encounter in such a way that spacecraft\nobservations can be complemented with ground-based observations;\n\no\n\nthe encounter should occur when the comet is not too far from the Sun (heliocentric\ndistance less than about 1.5 AU) and already shows physical activity;\n\no\n\nthe departure hyperbolic velocity should not exceed about 10 km/s (launch with\nAnane), but should preferably be well below this figure (a low departure hyperbolic\nvelocity allows a large payload mass for a given spacecraft);\n288\n\ni o\n!\n\nthe relative encounter velocity between comet and spacecraft should be as low as\npossible, in order to have a sufficiently long observation time in the proximity of\nthe comet.\n^\n\nj Taking into account these criteria and considering the periodic comets that have been\nobserved on more than one apparition and have predicted perihelion passages between 1984 and\n2000 Boissard et al. arrive at 10 candidate comets with 19 favorable perihelion passages\n(Table 3).\nTABLE 3.

This is indeed a problem as will be discussed later in detail. As Table 3 shows the\ndeparture hyperbolic excess velocity required to flyby Halley is one of the lowest.\nIn principle, minimum departure hyperbolic excess velocities Vh are achieved for comet\nencounters near the ecliptic plane. This allows two possibilities for an encounter with\nHalley: a pre-perihelion encounter near the ascending node (9 November 1985) or a\n\n289\n\npost-perihelion encounter near the decenchng node (10 March 1986). Depending on the launch\ndates these encounters can be reached in various ways, even trajectories with one or more full\nrevolutions around the Sun are conceivable. Figure 3 (top) shows the required launch energy\nC\n3 = vh f\xc2\xb0r the case of less than one full revolution around the Sun. Considering only\nlaunch energies 03 < 20 km^/sec2 we can identify three possibilities\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nlaunch early 1985; arrival ~ 20 December 1985.\nlaunch June/July 1985; arrival ~ 10 December 1985.\nlaunch July 1985; arrival ~ 15 March 1986.\n\n60\nOJ\n\n!\n\n50\n\nI\n\nm\nO\n>O\n\no:\n\nLU\n\n30\n\no\n20\n\npreVjjenhehor\n\n10\n\npost penhelior\n\nMAR 25\n\n1986\nMAR 15\nLU\n0\n\ncr\nLU\n\no\no\n\nMAR 5\n\nDEC 30\n\nLLJ\n\nDEC 20\n\no\n\nDEC 10\n\nipre-penhehon\n\n1985\n\nNOV 30\nNOV 1\n\nJAN 1\n\nMAR 1\n\nMAY 1\n\nJUL 1\n\nSEP 1\n\nNOV 1\n\n1985\n\nLAUNCH\n\nDATE\n\nFigure 3. Launch opportunities for Hal ley encounters with less than one full orbit\naround the Sun. The upper plot gives the minimum launch energy 03 required for\nlaunch dates between November 1984 and November 1985, the lower plot gives the\ncorresponding optimal arrival dates at the comet, (after Cornelisse, 1980)\n290\n\nThe optimal arrival dates are obtained from Figure 3 (bottom). It is interesting to note\nthat the minimum launch energy for a pre-perihelion encounter is reached for an encounter in\nmid-December 1985 and not around 9 November.\nThe reason is, of course, that the in-ecliptic Vh required for an encounter around\n9 November, when Halley is at 1.8 AU from for ansun, is much larger than the combined out-of\nthe\necliptic and in-ecliptic components of Vh\nencounter around 20 December, when Halley is\nat ,1.2 AU from the Sun.\nAs shown by Cornelisse (1980) the declination of the launch asymptote AA has very\nunfavorable values for a pre-perihelion encounter: AA < -60\xc2\xb0 for a winter 1984/85 launch\nand AA > +20\xc2\xb0 for a summer 1985 launch, if 03 is required to be reasonably small\n(< 20 km2/sec2). This more or less rules out a pre-perihelion encounter of Giotto with\nHalley, since only -15\xc2\xb0 < AA < +15\xc2\xb0 leads to reasonably small values of 63 considering\nan Ariane launch from Kourou. If, in addition, the constraint of a second passenger on Ariane\nis taken into account then only A^ values close to -5\xc2\xb0 are reasonable, which makes\npre-perihelion encounters impossible to achieve with any reasonable payload mass. For the\npost-perihelion encounter, on the other hand, it turns out that the minimum launch energies\ncoincide with values of AA around 0\xc2\xb0.\n2.3 Comet Halley\'s Historical Role\nAs shown in the previous sections comet Halley\'s fame was not the prime consideration for\nits selection. However, it is worth pointing out that Halley is the most prominent of all\ncomets considering the role it played through historical times.\nEdmqnd Halley, an English astronomer, discovered that the comets that appeared in 1531,\n1607 and 1682 were actually one and the same comet. He was then able to predict that that\ncomet would reappear in late 1758. Although Halley did not live to see his prediction come\ntrue his correct prediction led to his name being given to the most famous comet, and led also\nto the important discovery of the periodicity of a certain category of comets.\nOnce the periodicity of Halley\'s comet was revealed it was also possible to associate\nseveral spectacular comet apparitions in historical times with Halley\'s comet. The earliest\n"fairly certain" apparition of Halley occurred in 240 BC, although sightings of a comet in the\nwinter of 1057/58 BC, as deduced from ancient Chinese records, have been associated with\nHalley. Table 4 lists the dates of the last 29 perihelion passages which have been calculated\nby Yeomans and Kiang (1981). The average period between appearances of the comet is nearly 77\nyears, but individual orbits vary somewhat in period, due to the gravitational effects of the\nplanets.\nTABLE 4.

Hal ley is depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry\nwnich was embroidered a few years later showing the history of the conquest. Three apparitions\nlater, in 1301, the Florentine painter Giotto di Bondone saw Halley and incorporated it\nrealistically in a fresco cycle decorating the interior of the Arena chapel in Padua. The\n"Adoration of the Magi" is the second tier of the cycle and shows Halley as the Star of\nBethlehem. Because of this painting, which may be considered as the first scientific\ndescription of Halley recorded in history, the European Space Agency (ESA) has given the name\n"Giotto" to its Halley cometary mission.\nAlready in 1835, during its second predicted apparition, Halley\'s comet was the focus of\ngreat scientific interest. At that time detailed drawings from visual observations were made\nwhich even today serve as a basis for scientific work on Halley.\nBy 1910, during Halley\'s third predicted apparition, the scientific interest had grown\ntremendously, in particular because it was predicted that Halley would come very close to the\nEarth, and that the Earth would actually go through the tail of the comet. The population was\nalarmed since it became known that the comet contained cyanide (CN), a poisonous gas. However,\nthe density of molecules in the comet\'s tail is so thin, that although the Earth actually did\ngo through the comet\'s tail nothing happened.\nThe 1985/86 apparition is the fourth predicted apparition and it is the first opportunity\nfor spacecraft to be sent to Halley to observe the comet from close by and to carry out\nmeasurements in the cometary atmosphere.\n3. MISSION SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES\n\nComets are a substantial component of the solar system with a total mass of planetary\nmagnitude. For unknown reasons, this mass condensed into small bodies for which the internal\npressure and temperature were not sufficient to cause differentiation or other physical\nchanges. Thus comets are probably the most pristine, primitive objects available for studies\nof the evolution of the solar system. Furthermore, the outer skin of a comet is removed during\neach close passage by the Sun to expose fresh material for analysis. Measurements of the\ncomposition and physical constitution of comets will thus yield fundamental information on the\nchemical and physical conditions that existed near the time of planetary formation and on the\nprocesses of condensation, agglomeration, and mixing which were taking place. Comets may\ncontain pre-solar system or interstellar grains, both of which are otherwise unavailable for\nstudy. They may have been a major source of organic materials in the atmospheres of the\nterrestrial planets. Thus a study of their composition should provide clues about the nature\nof the pre-biological environment on Earth.\nMost of the detailed knowledge concerning the state of the formative solar system has come\nfrom studies of meteorites. The principal uncertainty is the source of meteorites. A comet\nmission could-establish-the relat-ions between comets and meteorites of different classes, as\nwell as between comets and interplanetary dust, meteoroids, and the Apollo asteroids.\nSince the composition of comets appears to be similar to that of interstellar clouds, the\nstudy of comets may help solve major problems concerning molecule formation and the nature of\ninterstellar clouds and dark nebulae. Some cometary molecules may be the molecular precursors\nof life.\n\n292\n\nWhipple\'s icy conglomerate theory is the most widely accepted theory of the nature of\ncometary nuclei. Close examination of a comet is needed to test this theory.\nThe physical mechanisms reponsible for the rapid dissociation and ionization of cometary\ngases and their acceleration into the ion tail are not understood. In situ studies of such\ncometary phenomena appear essential for the clarification of these processes. Also, such\nobservations can yield new insights into certain geomagnetic and astrophysical phenomena.\nComets are unique free probes of the interplanetary medium, but in situ observations are\nrequired to establish the link between cometary and solar wind conditions and ground-based\nobservations.\nAn encounter with a comet is perhaps the last purely exploratory mission left in solar\nsystem studies. Very little is presently known about the most active members in our solar\nsystem. For example, we can only speculate about the existence and size of a body (the comet\nnucleus) which around perihelion is able to produce a hydrogen corona which is many times\nlarger than the Sun. The absence of external heating and heating by self-gravitation due to\nthe small mass of the comets led to a composition which is qualitatively different from all\nother bodies in the solar system.\nObservations of comets from near-Earth (ground based or from space) are limited in that\nthey can only provide line of sight integrations. Only molecules with strong emission lines in\nsuitable wavelength ranges can be observed by remote sensing. In particular, the parent\nmolecules from the nucleus can only be detected by in situ measurements which are needed to\nunravel the complex physical and chemical processes in the cometary atmosphere. The comet\nnucleus is too small to be resolved by ground based telescopes or even the Space Telescope.\nMost of these open questions and problems are addressed by the scientific objectives of the\nGiotto Scientific Working Group. These are:\no\n\nto provide the elemental and isotopic composition of the volatile components in the\ncometary coma, in particular to identify the parent molecules,\n\no\n\nto characterize the physical processes and chemical reactions that occur in the\ncometary atmosphere and ionosphere,\n\no\n\nto determine the elemental and isotopic composition of the cometary dust particles,\n\no\n\nto measure the total gas production rate and the dust flux and size/mass distribution\nand to derive the dust to gas ratio,\n\no\n\nto investigate the macroscopic system of plasma flows resulting from the interaction\nbetween the cometary and the solar wind plasma,\n\no\n\nto provide numerous images of the comet nucleus with a resolution down to 50 m. From\nthese the nucleus size and rotation may be deduced and its mass may be estimated.\n\nAn intense earth based observation programme is a natural and necessary complement to the\nGiotto mission.\n4. GIOTTO SCIENTIFIC PAYLOAD\n\nTo accomplish the objectives as given above the Giotto spacecraft will carry:\no\n\na camera for imaging the inner coma and the nucleus,\n\no\n\nneutral, ion and dust mass spectrometers for composition measurements,\n\no\n\na dust impact detector for studies of the dust environment,\n\no\n\nelectron and ion plasma analyzers and a magnetometer for plasma studies,\n\no\n\nan optical probe for in situ measurements of the cometary atmosphere.\n\n293\n\nThis model payload is almost the full complement of instruments needed for a cometary flyby\nmission distilled from more than a decade of intense study efforts carried out by ESA and NASA\nfor various proposed cometary missions.\nThe experiments are built by a large number of European and US institutes under the\nresponsibility of more than 80 Principal and Co-Investigators, including 33 US scientists.\nTable 5 gives a summary of the Giotto scientific experiments together with their\nmass/power/date rate allocations as established during the first Science Working Team meeting\non 16 and 17 February 1981.\nTABLE 5.

U. Keller\nMax-Planck-lnstitut fuer Aeronomie\nLindau, W. Germany\nMajor collaborating institutes (hardware):\nLaboratoire de Physique Stellaire et Planetaire, Verrieres, France\nInstitut d\'Astrophysique, Liege, Belgium\nIstituto di Astronomia, Padova, Italy\nDFVLR, Oberpfaffenhofen, W. Germany\nBall Aerospace Systems Division, Boulder, Colorado\nThe optical system of the Halley Multicolour Camera (HMC) is a modified Ritchey-Chretien\ndesign with correcting field lens. The telescope has a focal length of 96 cm and an aperture\nof 16 cm, the separation between the primary and the secondary mirror is 25 cm. The telescope\nis mounted behind the spacecraft bumper shield and therefore protected from direct dust\nparticle impacts. A 45\xc2\xb0 deflecting mirror is used to look at the comet. A mirror can be\ntilted (* l^which assures that there is no "blind spot". A baffle of about 40 cm\nlength assures adequate reduction of diffuse sunlight and spacecraft reflected light.\nThe telescope images onto a focal plane arrangement of 1 linear CCD and 2 area CCDs. A\nlong (1.5\xc2\xb0) linear CCD (2048 x 1 pixels with 13 x 13y pixel size) is used to detect the\nnucleus and later for timing and clocking of the two area CCDs. The two area CCDs with two\nindependent segments each (each segment has 385 x 288 pixels with 22y x 22u pixel size) are\nmasked except for the first four lines which are covered by colour filters, the remaining lines\nare used as intermediate readout buffers. One of the light sensitive strips is covered by a\nmovable filter plate providing 10 colour bands for coma and nucleus observations.\nSince the camera operates in a spin scan mode (Giotto is spinning at 15 rpm) the exposure\ntime is very short. The sensitivity is therefore enhanced by about a factor of 4 using time\ndelay and integration (TDI) during exposure. The HMC can rotate around 180\xc2\xb0 which allows to\nfollow the nucleus during approach and to image it even after the flyby. Because of data rate\nlimitations only 100 x 100 pixels (each pixel coded with 8 bits) can be transmitted every\n4 seconds. The Best Image is stored and continuously updated. It contains the full\ninformation (385 x 1152 pixels in 4 colours), requiring a transmission time of 3 minutes at 20\nkbps. At 1400 km the HMC is expected to resolve nucleus surface structures down to 30 m.\n4.2 Neutral Mass Spectrometer\nPrincipal Investigator: D. Krankowsky\nMax-Planck-lnstitut fuer Kernphysik\nHeidelberg, W. Germany\nMajor collaborating institutes (hardware):\nPhysikalisches Institut, University of Bonn, W. Germany\nPhysikalisches Institut, University of Berne, Switzerland\nLaboratoire de Geophysique Externe, CNRS, Saint-Maur, France\nThe University of Texas, Dallas\nThe neutral mass spectrometer consists of a parallel plate electrostatic analyzer\n(E-analyzer) and a second parallel plate analyzer coupled with a magnetic analyzer (M-analyzer)\nin a double focussing geometry (angle and energy). The M-analyzer will provide an\nidentification and a simultaneous measurement of the abundance of all gas species in the\n1 - 34 amu mass range with a resolution of < 0.5 amu even if the particles have kinetic\nenergies of up to 20 eV in the comet frame. Some gas molecules may derive significant kinetic\nenergy from dissociation processes of parent species. The E-analyzer will measure the energy\ndistribution function of each gas species in the mass range 1 to 86 amu. Above the range with\nthe M-analyzer (34 amu), the kinetic energy in the comet frame will be small compared to that\nfrom the ram velocity of the gas molecule into the instrument. In this range (34 - 86 amu) the\nE-analyzer will provide mass and abundance information for each gas species. As both the\n295\n\nM- and E- analyzers have focal plane detectors the full mass-energy range is measured\nsimultaneously and no scanning is required. This leads to very high sensitivity and good\nspatial resolution.\nThe M- and E-analyzers have separate entrance apertures and ion sources. The detection\nlimit of both analyzers is ~ 10 neutral particles/cm3 and 3 x 10-5 ion/cm3 for a ~ 1.5\nsecond integration period each. A spatial resolution of approximately 100 km for each gas\nspecies is obtained. Close to the nucleus the instrument will measure both neutrals and ions\nin a time sharing mode giving a complete set of neutral gas parameters (identity, abundance,\nenergy distribution) every 1.5 seconds and a complete set of ion parameters every 3 seconds.\nThe sensitivity to ambient ions is reduced in this region in order to expand the range of\nmeasurable ion densities to 3 x 104/cm3. At greater distances, both before and after\nencounter, where the neutral density is too low for detection, only the ion mode will be used.\n4.3 Ion Mass Spectrometer\nPrincipal Investigator: H. Balsiger\nPhysikalisches Institut\nUniversity of Berne\nSwitzerland\nMajor collaborating institutes (hardware):\nMax-Planck-Institut fuer Aeronomie, Lindau, W. Germany\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nLockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory, California\nThe ion mass spectrometer measures the ion mass/charge distribution, the energy\ndistribution and the direction of incidence of both solar wind and cometary ions. The main\ninstrument maps the ion distribution on two-dimensional detectors, with one dimension a measure\nof mass/charge and the other dimension a measure of the elevation angle of the ion\'s velocity\nvector. Azimuth angle is scanned by the spacecraft spin and the energy distribution is\ndetermined by variation of the voltages applied to the instrument.\nIons incident from the forward hemisphere are deflected into the instrument by an\nelectrostatic mirror which can withstand the expected dust particle impacts. The ions are then\naccelerated or decelerated by a pair of grids with variable applied voltage before they enter\nthe analysis part of the instrument. The ions are analyzed by a sector magnet (0.35 Tesla)\nwhich serves as a momentum/charge filter with a very wide angular acceptance and an\nelectrostatic reflector which spreads the momentum-analyzed ion beam according to their\nenergy/charge. The ions are registered by two microchannel plate detectors with position\nsensitive readout. The instrument has a mass/charge range of 1-65 amu/q,, a mass resolution\nm/Am of 20 at 20 amu/q and an energy range 0.1-10 keV. The field of view is a fan shaped\nacceptance cone 100\xc2\xb0 i\'n elevation (from 5\xc2\xb0 on one side of the spin axis to 95\xc2\xb0 on the\nother side) and 2\xc2\xb0 in azimuth.\nThe main instrument is complemented by a smaller second composition analyzer employing two\nquadrispherical electrostatic analyzers with magnetic deflection (0.15 Tesla) and 12\nchanneltrons as detectors. This second instrument has a mass/charge range of 8-65 amu/q, a\nmass resolution m/Am of 20 at 20 amu/q and an energy range of 20-1500 eV. The field of view in\nelevation is * 6\xc2\xb0 to either side of the spin axis. This forward looking instrument is\nmainly intended for the inner coma region.\n4.4 Particulate Impact Analyzer\nPrincipal Investigator:\n\nJ. Kissel\nMax-Planck-Institut fuer Kernphysik\nHeidelberg, W. Germany\n\nUpon impact of a particle onto the sensor\'s 5 cm? target a plasma is generated from which\nions are extracted and accelerated via a 1.5 kV acceleration grid. Once the ions of the impact\nplasma have passed the grid they fly through a timeof flight tube (TOP) of ~ 1 m length when\n\n296\n\nthey separate in time according to their mass. The TOP actually consists of two time of flight\ntubes which are at an angle of ~ 15\xc2\xb0 with an ion reflector in-between, used for energy\nfocussing. The time of flight mass spectrum for each individual dust particle impact is then\nrecorded with an electron multiplier at the end of the drift path.\nThe method of impact ionization mass spectrometry is ideally suited for the fast flyby\nmission to comet Halley because the amount of positive ions released upon impact increases\nsignificantly with the impact velocity. Instruments based on this principle have been\nsuccessfully flown on Pioneer 8/9, Heos 2, Helios 1/2 or are currently implemented (Galileo,\nISPM). The ion reflector, however, will be used for the first time. This together with the\nhigh ion yield gives a dramatic improvement of the mass resolution from m/Am = 5 (Helios) to\nm/Am = 200 at m = 100. This is quite sufficient to separate adjacent mass lines with a dynamic\nrange of 10^ in the instrument\'s whole mass range of 1-110 amu and to allow measurements of\nisotopic ratios such as 7|_i/6|-i, ^B/lOfi and 13c/12c.\n, The specific sensitivity of the method applied and the restrictions due to onboard data\nprocessing give 1 15 percent relative accuracy for mass lines, 1 25 percent for mass\nratios and a factor 3... 4 for absolute composition data. It is expected that particles can be\ndefinitely attached to a mineral type using the composition data. Also the absence of key\nelements as well as an analysis in terms of minerals known to be abundant in chondrites will\nfurther improve the accuracy of the composition data. Variations of particle type or mean\ncomposition vs. distance to the comet will yield information on the release mechanism.\nBecause of the small target area the instrument will predominantly analyze the most\nfrequent dust particles which are expected in the mass range 10~16 to 10-10 g,\ncorresponding to particle diameters 0.1 - lOvi. 2The target area can be adapted to the actual\ndust particle flux and varies from 0.5 - 500 mm .\n4.5 Dust Impact Detector System\nPrincipal Investigator: J. A. M. McDonnell\nUniversity of Kent at Canterbury\nCanterbury, England\nMajor collaborating institute (hardware):\nMax-Pianck-Institut fuer Kernphysik, Heidelberg, W. Germany\nBecause of its small target area the dust impact mass spectrometer provides predominantly\ninformation on the most frequent particles, i.e., particles in the mass range ~ 10-17 10-10 g. However, the bulk of the mass lifted off from the comet nucleus in the form of\nsolids is contained in the larger particles. Measurement of the dust particle number spectrum\nup to very large masses is necessary to determine the comet dust to gas ratio. This is the\nmain scientific objective of the dust impact detector system.\nBecause the larger dust particles are relatively infrequent a large area detector is\nrequired to reliably determine the dust particle number spectrum. Therefore, the whole shield\nsurface area (2.5 m2) is used. In order to comply with the enormous dynamic range of\nparticle mass to be covered different types of detectors have to be used:\ni\n\n, 1. An impact plasma detector array of several hundred cm2 area will predominantly\ndetect impacts of smaller dust particles (10-H - 10~17 g). Principle: The impact plasma\nis separated by an electric field, the total charge is proportional to the particle mass. The\nimpact plasma detector has two arrays, one without a foil, the other covered by a submicron\nmetallized penetration film, which would observe a somewhat reduced number of impacts depending\non the penetrating power or bulk density of the dust particles. This technique, which was\nsuccessfully used on the Helios 1/2 spacecraft, gives an average of the bulk density in the\nmass range 10"\'^ - 10~H g. Momentum sensing on this acoustically isolated sensor covering\nthe mass range 10-13 - 10-10 g is independent of ionization efficiency, thus allowing the\ndetermination of mass at 68 km s~l and hence provide the calibration for the ionization\nefficiency.\n\n297\n\n2. The momentum transfer to the front sheet of the shield is measured for non-penetrating\nparticles by 3 microphones mounted 120\xc2\xb0 apart at the outer end of the front sheet.\nPrinciple: The shock wave which is generated by each particle impact propagates through the\nfront sheet and is observed by the microphones. Three sensors are used in coincidence to\ndetermine the impact position and to yield the noise immunity necessary for a fast comet\nflyby. The meteoroid shield momentum measurement uses the whole shield area and would\npredominantly measure larger particle impacts > 10-10 g.\nA fourth microphone is placed on the rear sheet of the bumper shield in order to measure\nthe momentum/mass of even larger dust particles which are able to penetrate the front sheet\n(m > 10-7 g).\n4.6 Fast Ion Sensor/Implanted Ion Sensor\nPrincipal Investigator: A. Johnstone\nMallard Space Science Laboratory\nHolmbury St. Mary, England\nMajor collaborating institutes (hardware):\nMax-Planck-Institut fuer Aeronomie, Lindau, W. Germany\nIstituto Plasma Spaziale, Frascati, Italy\nThis instrument consists of two sensors. A Fast Ion Sensor operating in two modes measures\nthe solar wind distribution with high angular and energy resolution and obtains a 3-dimensional\nion distribution with coarse angular and energy resolution. An Implanted Ion Sensor measures\nthe distribution of cometary ions picked up by the solar wind after being ionized at large\ndistances from the nucleus.\nThe Fast Ion Sensor consists of a hemispherical plate electrostatic energy analyzer with a\nsubsequent quadrispherical sector (80\xc2\xb0) to disperse the trajectories according to the input\npolar angles and a microchannel plate to detect the particles emerging from the analyzer. To\nfind the solar wind distribution the data are accumulated from four polar sectors between\n32.5\xc2\xb0 and 122.5\xc2\xb0 and from 16 azimuthal sectors centered on the solar direction. In each\nsector energy resolution is provided by an energy sweep in 32 equal energy bands (AE/E = 7.5\npercent) in the range 200 - 8000 eV. Data are compressed by only transmitting the energy\nspectrum of the eight angular bins with the highest fluxes. As the distribution broadens\ncorresponding to an increase in the temperature of the solar wind, adjacent angular bins are\ncombined together.\nFor the fast 3-d survey, each energy sweep is divided into eight equal energy bands (AE/E =\n30 percent) from 200 - 8000 eV, with spatial resolution obtained in three polar sectors between\n10\xc2\xb0 and 145\xc2\xb0 and in four 90\xc2\xb0 wide azimuthal sectors.\nThe Implanted Ion Sector (IIS) is an ion spectrometer which combines an electrostatic\nanalyzer with a time-of-flight measurement. The quadrispherical electrostatic analyzer selects\npositive ions of a given energy per charge E/Q, which are then accelerated by a potential\ndifference, V, before the time T to travel a path length D is determined. By measuring these\nquantities the mass to charge ratio can be determined.\n\nM _ ? (V + - } (V\nQ \' *\nQ \'D2\nSince cometary particles are ionized by charge-exchange or photons the charge state is\npredominantly Q = 1, allowing the ion mass to be determined.\nThe instrument uses six time-of-flight tubes with a path length of 4 cm each. The "start"\nsignal is provided by secondary electrons generated by the ion passage through a thin carbon\nfoil, the "stop" signal by secondary electrons generated in the surface layer of a spherically\nshaped aluminum absorber.\n\n298\n\nThe IIS measures in six polar directions\' in the range 20\xc2\xb0 - 160\xc2\xb0 and in 16 azimuthal\nsectors over 360\xc2\xb0. Both mass and energy spectra are expanded into 32 channels. Within 16\nspin periods the instrument generates a complete 3-d distribution of six selected ion groups,\nwhile a detailed mass spectrum is accumulated over 32 spin periods. The energy range of the\nsector is 0.1 - 70 keV with an upper mass limit of 44 amu.\n4.7 Electron Electrostatic Analyzer/Positive Ion Cluster Composition Analyzer\nPrincipal Investigator:\n\nH. Reme\nCentre d\'Etudes Spatiale des Rayonnements\nCNRS\nToulouse, France\n\nMajor collaborating institutes (hardware):\nMax-Planck-Institut fuer Aeronomie, Lindau, U. Germany\nSpace Sciences Laboratory, university of California, Berkeley, California\nThis instrument consists of two sensors. An Electron Electrostatic Analyzer (EESA) is\nintended to measure the pitch-angle distributions for suprathermal electrons in the energy\nrange 0.01 - 30 keV, a Positive Ion Cluster Composition Analyzer (PICCA) measures positive ions\nand positive clathrate hydrates (R+ \xe2\x80\xa2 (H20)m) up to masses > 200 amu in the innermost\npart of the coma.\nThe basic EESA analyzer design is a symmetrical spherical section electrostatic analyzer\nwhich has a uniform 360\xc2\xb0 x 4\xc2\xb0 disk-shaped field of view and extremely fine angular\nresolution capability (2\xc2\xb0 x 4\xc2\xb0). The symmetric quadrisphere consists of an inner\nhemisphere which contains a circular opening, and a small circular top cap which defines the\nentrance aperture. This analyzer is hemispherical in shape but called quadrispherical because\nthe particles are only deflected through 90\xc2\xb0. As in the normal quadrispherical analyzer a\npotential is applied between the inner and outer plates and only charged particles having a\nlimited range of energy and initial azimuth angle are transmitted.\nThe electrons are registered by a position sensitive detector consisting of a microchannel\nplate electron multiplier with a position encoding anode and an anti-coincidence scintillator.\nThe position sensitive detector with its anti-coincidence shield form an annulus at the\nanalyzer exit aperture.\nThe instrument operates in two modes. In the "Full Pitch Angle Mode" a 16 channel energy\nspectrum in the energy range 0.01 - 30 keV is integrated for 2 sec over all angles. In the\n"Fast Pitch Angle Energy Scan Mode" the energy range 0.03 - 30 keV is divided into six\nchannels, with spatial information being obtained every 2 sec in 26 viewing directions, each\n45\xc2\xb0 x 45^ wide. In addition, the angular position of the count rate maximum of each of the\nsix energy channels is identified.\nThe light-weight PICCA subexperiment is intended for operation in the innermost part of the\ncoma only, where the cometary ions are expected to be singly charged and to have negligible\nthermal velocities. In the spacecraft frame of reference these particles will flow strictly\nradially towards the spacecraft with a velocity of 68 km/s and their kinetic energy will\ntherefore range from 24 eV (1 amu) to 6.3 keV (256 amu). As the energy E and the charge Q of\nthe particles to be analyzed are known, an E/Q measurement is directly related to their mass\nm. Thus PICCA is designed to be an electrostatic analyzer with a single channeltron as\ndetecting device with the advantage (i) to be much more lightweight than any magnetic mass\nspectrometer and (ii) to perform individual measurements of M in less than\nEven with an AE/E of 10 percent of mass resolution of Am < 1 is achieved by using an open\ndeceleration device (DD) into the collimator in front of the electrostatic analyzer. First DD\nis set to 0V allowing particles with masses 1-8 amu to be analyzed, second DD is set to a\ndiscrete positive voltage to reject particles with m < 8 amu to allow particles with masses\n9-16 to be analyzed, etc. Considering that the energy cycle covering 8 masses at a time in the\nanalyzer itself takes ~ 80 msec a full cycle from 1 to 256 amu takes ~ 2.5 sec.\n\n299\n\n4.8 Energetic Particles\n\nPrincipal Investigator: S. McKenna-Lawlor\nSt. Patrick\'s College\nMaynooth, Ireland\nMajor collaborating institutes (hardware):\nDublin Institute for Advanced Studies, Dublin, Ireland\nMax-Planck-Institut fuer Aeronomie, Lindau, W. Germany\nThe Energetic Particles Experiment (EPA) is a very lightweight telescope (400 g) with a\nlarge geometric factor (~ 1 cm? sr) to measure electrons > 30 keV, protons > 100 keV and\nparticles with Z > 2 and > 2.1 MeV. Three totally depleted silicon surface barrier detectors\nwill be employed:\n\nDetectors\n\nArea\n\nShape\n\nThickness\n\nA\n\n1.13 cm2\n\n50 pin\n\nCircular\n\nB\n\n1.13 cm2\n\n100 urn\n\nCircular\n\nC\n\n4.0 cm2\n\n100 pm\n\nCircular\n\nThe three detectors have three discriminator thresholds each.

In addition, the instrument is\npassively shielded by an aluminum wall of 5 mm thickness which absorbs galactic and solar\ncosmic rays (e.g., protons < 33 MeV). The aperture of the telescope is a cone with 60\xc2\xb0 full\nangle, oriented perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis. The instrument has coarse spatial\nresolution provided by accumulating the counting rate in four sectors during one spacecraft\nspin.\nThe prime purpose of the EPA is to extend the range of the Giotto plasma analyzers to\nhigher energies and to measure the high energy tail of comet-accelerated particles, the\ndeflection of low energy solar particles at the bow shock and their absorption by cometary dust\nnear the nucleus. In addition, EPA monitors the energetic solar particle fluxes and thus\nprovides useful background information, in particular, during a solar flare to instruments\nusing devices which are sensitive to these particles, such as channeltrons, channel plates and\nCCD.\n4.9 Magnetometer\nPrincipal Investigator: F. M. Neubauer\nInstitut fuer Geophysik und Meteorologie\nT. U. Braunschweig, W. Germany\nMajor collaborating institutes (hardware):\nLaboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics, NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt, Maryland\nIstituto Plasma Spaziale, CNR, Frascati, Italy\nThe magnetic field is measured by a wide range (0.004 - 65536 nT) triaxial ringcore\nfluxgate magnetometer mounted on the antenna mast. The Giotto magnetometer is identical to the\nGSFC-fluxgate magnetometers flown on Voyager and intended for flight on ISPM, apart from\nimproved noise characteristics by use of different sensor core alloys.\nThe principle of the fluxgate magnetometer is as follows: Suppose in the simplest sensor\narrangement a ferromagnetic core of soft magnetic material is periodically driven into\nsaturation by a drive coil generating a periodic magnetic field strength of suitable wave shape\nat the drive frequency f0. An additional sense coil around the core will then exhibit a\ndistorted signal composed of frequency components at f0 and odd harmonics. Addition of an\nambient magnetic field component along the core axis will lead to the appearance of even\nharmonics. Generally, in fluxgate magnetometers the second harmonic is detected because its\namplitude turns out to be proportional to the ambient field component parallel to the core or\nthe sense coil axis. In order to obtain good linearity a feedback coil is generally added to\ncompensate the ambient magnetic field in response to the output from the sense coil. In this\ncase, the sense coil is essentially used for zero detection only.\nThe fluxgate sensor has a ring core which is superior to other geometries in terms of long\nterm zero level stability and drive power requirements. The magnetic material used in these\ncores is the latest in a series of advanced molybdenum permalloy alloys which have been\nespecially developed for low-noise and high stability.\nSince one basic magnetometer reading, i.e., one vector, is described by 40 bits, the\nallocated data rate of 1200 bps allows a sampling rate of 30 vectors/sec. Measurements before\nthe general science data take which starts only at 3:45 hours before closest approach are\nobtained by using a small 65 bit-memory. At a sampling rate of two vectors per minute the\nmemory allows to store data for over 13 hours to be transmitted at the begin of the general\nscience data take.\nEvery magnetic field experiment on a spacecraft has to cope with the problem of\ncontamination by spacecraft fields due to magnetized material and electric currents in the\nspacecraft. Therefore, a minimum magnetic cleanliness programme which is still compatible with\nthe spacecraft low cost design philosophy was incorporated very early. In addition,\nmeasurements during the cruise phase allow the determination of a constant spacecraft magnetic\nfield vector. To a limited extent it is possible to "calibrate" the spacecraft in the\n\n301\n\ninterplanetary medium by controlled changes of experiment and spacecraft modes. Finally, the\nspin of the spacecraft allows the determination of the Bx and By components of the\nspacecraft magnetic field.\n4.10 Optical Probe Experiment\nPrincipal Investigator: A. C. Levasseur-Regourd\nService d\'Aeronomie du CNRS\nVerrieres-le-Buisson, France\nMajor collaborating institutes (hardware):\nLaboratoire d\'Astronomie Spatiale, CNRS, Marseille, France\nSpace Astronomy Laboratory, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida\nObservations of cosmic dust have traditionally been classified as either "remote"\n(essentially optical) or "in situ" (mass spectrometers or impact detectors). Optical remote\nsensing results in a column brightness (integration over the line of sight) whose\ninterpretation (inversion of the integral) is impossible without assumptions about both the\nspatial distribution of the dust grains and their scattering properties. In a cometary flyby a\nthird type of observation, in-situ photopolarimetric observation and referred to as optical\nprobing, is possible. It is the necessary link between the other in situ observations on\nGiotto and future, remote only, observations of comets.\nFor a photopolarimeter aimed tangentially to the spacecraft orbit, inversion of the\nbrightness integral is rigorous and provides, without any assumption, in-situ observation on\nthe local spatial density of dust and gas and on the scattering properties of dust grains. The\nrequirement to observe tangentially offers two possibilities: forward or rearward,\ncorresponding to scattering angles of 73\xc2\xb0 or 107\xc2\xb0 from the sun. Because of the less\ncritical engineering demands (smaller baffle, no dust particle impacts) a rearward looking\ninstrument was chosen.\nThe photopolarimeter utilizes a small refracting photometer composed of an objective lens\n(F/2.5, 12 mm diameter), eight interference filters located on the flat surface of the\nplano-convex objective lens, two spectrally matching polaroid foils, a field stop, a field\nlens, and a microchannel photomultiplier for spectral analysis. No moving parts are used. The\nrotation of the polaroid analyzers to determine the polarization is provided by the spinning\nspacecraft. One complete polarization measurement is performed during half a spacecraft spin,\ni.e., in 2 seconds. Successive line-of-sight measurements can be differenced such that the\nresulting brightnesses and polarizations only refer to a small volume of space (a "cylinder" of\nabout 140 km in length and 7 km (corresponding to the instrument\'s 3\xc2\xb0 cone field of view) in\ndiameter).\nThe dust will be observed in four spectral bands which are free or almost free of gaseous\nemissions: 338-362, 438-454, 570-586, 657-698 nm. Simultaneously, four discrete gaseous\nemissions w i l l be observed: CS (258 nm), OH (309 nm), CN (388 nm), C2 (516 nm).\nThe instrument will determine as a function of the spacecraft position:\no\n\nthe variation of the dust number density,\n\no\n\nchanges in the dust particle size distribution\n\no\n5.\n\nthe distribution of gaseous emissions (CS, OH, CN, 02).\n\no\n\nthe ratio of gaseous emission/dust scattering.\n\nMISSION ANALYSIS\n\nThe Giotto mission is a fast flyby of comet Halley near the comet\'s post-perihelion\ncrossing of the ecliptic plane around 13 March 1986, ~ 1 month after the comet\'s perihelion\npassage. The baseline approach is a launch by Ariane in tandem configuration with another\nspacecraft. Ariane will launch both spacecraft in July 1985 into a Geostationary Transfer\nOrbit (GTO) (perigee 200 km, apogee 35786 km) where a separation of the two spacecraft will\ntake place. After some resolution of this GTO, the number of which is principally dictated by\n\n302\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\'\n\nEarth at Halley encounter (post-PH)\n\nLaunch\n10/7\n\n9/8\n\nFigure 4. Left: Reference trajectory for Giotto from launch on 10 July 1985 to\npost-perihelion Halley encounter on 13 March 1986.\nRight: Geometry at Halley encounter. The spacecraft will be targeted to pass the\ncomet nucleus on the sunward side. The estimated la miss distance is ~ 500 km.\nlaunch data and orbit re-constitution requirements, the solid propellant motor onboard the\nGiotto spacecraft will be fired close to GTO perigee to inject the spacecraft into the comet\ntransfer trajectory. This heliocentric trajectory (Figure 4, left) has a closest approach to\nthe sun of 0.7 AU and encounters Halley at a distance of 0.89 AU to the sun. The phase angle\nto the sun is 197.2\xc2\xb0 (Figure 4, right), i.e., the spacecraft approaches the comet nucleus\nfrom "behind", which is very fortunate for spacecraft survival considering that large dust\nparticles are predominantly injected into the sunward hemisphere. The flyby velocity is\n68 km s-1.\nDuring the transfer (or cruise) phase, spacecraft communications to earth will be acquired\non a daily basis with the prime intent of spacecraft engineering and conditioning. During\nthese intervals it may be possible to operate some experiments within the limits set by\nengineering constraints.\nDuring cruise a number of mid-course manoeuvers are required to target the spacecraft at\nthe comet nucleus. The spacecraft position is determined by earth-based tracking, while the\ncomet ephemeris will be continuously updated by earth-based observations right up to the last\norbit manoeuver foreseen ~ 2 days before the encounter. The analysis indicates that a la\ndelivery error at the comet of 650 x 250 km (error ellipse) can be achieved. This error is\nmostly due to the uncertainty of the nucleus position in the coma (assumed to be 2" as seen\nfrom earth). It is estimated that a total AV of ~ 150 m s-1 is required which is provided by\nonboard thrusters using hydrazine.\nIn principle, it would be possible to use the onboard camera for terminal navigation.\nThis is, however, not feasible for the Giotto mission since the comet must be observed by the\ncamera against the background star field. The camera sensitivity will probably limit star\ndetection at magnitude 6 whereas analysis has shown that there are no suitable guide-stars of\nsufficient magnitude within the 3\xc2\xb0 field of view of the camera.\n303\n\nAt encounter the spacecraft provides an operational data take period of about 4 hours and\nin view of the potential hazards to the spacecraft from impacting cometary dust, the data will\nbe transmitted to earth in real-time (no spacecraft on-board memory is provided). During the\nencounter the strategy in autonomous operation of the spacecraft apart from potential switching\nof data rates in the case of degradation of receiving conditions due to heavy rain at the site\nof the ground stration.\nTable 7 shows the final operation sequence just before the encounter.\nTABLE 7.

Comet Hal ley encounter model.\n6.\n\nSPACECRAFT DESIGN\nThe cross sectional view of the Giotto spacecraft (Figure 6) shows its main features:\n\no\n\na bumper shield consisting of a thin (1.2 mm Al) front sheet and thick (13 mm Kevlar)\nrear sheet separated by 25 cm to protect the spacecraft against impacting cometary\ndust particles up to 0.1 g.\n\no\n\nA solid propellant kick motor centrally mounted along the spin axis with a AV\ncapability of ~ 1400 m/s. Four quadrants flap over the kick motor nozzle after firing\nand complete the front sheet of the bumper shield.\n\no\n\nAn antenna farm consisting of a high gain dish antenna (paraboloid of 1.5 m diameter)\nand a low gain, large beam-width antenna. The high gain antenna is despun and\nincluded at 44\xc2\xb0 to point at the earth during the encounter.\n\nThe spacecraft has essentially three equipment platforms, from top to bottom (Figure 5),\nthe "upper" platform, the "lower" platform and the "experiment" platform which is mounted on\ntop of the rear sheet of the bumper shield (with a small separation). The upper and lower\nplatforms carry spacecraft equipment boxes on both upper and lower faces, whereas all\nexperiment sensors and electronic boxes are mounted on the experiment platform, with the\nexception of the dust impact detectors (mounted on the front sheet of the bumper shield) and\nthe magnetometer sensor (mounted on the antenna mast). The experiment sensors can protrude\nfrom the spacecraft side wall up to 17 cm to allow measurements in the undisturbed flow of\ncometary particles. The constraint of 17 cm is imposed by the launch dynamic envelope of\n218 cm, centered on the spacecraft axis.\nGiotto is a spin-stabilized spacecraft, it spins at 15 rpm. At encounter, the velocity\nvector in the comet frame of reference (relative velocity vector) is aligned with the spin\naxis, i.e., all cometary particle streaming is from below in Figure 6. The spin axis, however,\nis not perfectly aligned with the relative velocity vector. Various errors (in-orbit\nmisalignment of the star mapper with respect to the "nominal" spin axis, dynamic imbalance,\nattitude control error, spin axis nutation) add up to a total error of 0.28\xc2\xb0 (la).\nPower is provided by a solar cell array (131 W at 0.9 AU from the sun) and by batteries\n(584 WH assuming a depth of discharge of 90 percent). Considering on the other hand the energy\nconsumed (X-band transmitter 87.4 W, other subsystems 40.0 W, experiments 61.7W) there is a\nsmall positive margin of 90 Wh for the 4-hour Halley encounter. In calculating the energy\nbalance it has been assumed that the solar cell array is lost 2 hours before t0 due to dust\nimpact which is probably overconservative.\nIt should be noted that the duration of the science data take period is not only limited\nby the available power but also by the amount of phase change material used for thermal control\nand by the availability of ground receiving stations.\n305\n\nLOW GAIN CARDIOID\nANTENNA\n\nS-BAND FEED\nANTENNA MAST\n\nX-BAND FEED HORN\nHIGH GAIN DISH ANTENNA\n\n2982\nDESPIN MECHANISM\n\n01624\nTWTA\'s\n\nUPPER PLATFORM\n\nHYDRAZINE TANKS\nLOWER PLATFORM\nEXPERIMENTS\nREAR SHEET\n\n/\nBUMPER SHIELD\n\nQM840\n\nFRONT SHEET\n\nFLAP MECHANISM\nKICK MOTOR\n\nCOMETARY PARTICLES\n\nFigure 6.

The Attitude Measurement System (AMS)\nconsisting of sun sensors and a star mapper is used throughout the cruise phase to measure\nso\'lar aspect angle, spin rate and star positions such that the spacecraft attitude can be\nreconstituted. In the design particular attention has been paid to anomalous conditions should\nthe spacecraft attitude be disturbed and antenna earth pointing be lost. This is particularly\nimportant when the spacecraft earth distance is so great that the communication can only be\nmaintained by the HGA. In this anomalous condition the Attitude Recovery Unit (ARU) initiates\na \'recovery sequence in which the Spacecraft is processed at a constant solar aspect angle about\nthe spacecraft-sun line until the apropriate star pattern is recognized. The Reaction Control\nEquipment has a total AV capability of ~ 200 m/s and requires approximately 44 kg of\nhydrazine. Six thrusters are used: 2 radial, 2 axial, 2 tangential.\nThe Telemetry Tracking and Command (TT and C) Subsystem consists of a\no\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\n\n5 W S-band (2.3 GHz,) redundant transmitters operating via a cardioid low gain large\nbeam-width antenna (3\xc2\xb0 pointing required) or via the high gain antenna (0.5\xc2\xb0\npointing required),\n\no\n\n20 W X-band (8.4 GHz) redundant transmitters (TWT) operating via the high gain antenna,\n\no\n\nredundant S-band receivers for command reception and ranging.\n\nThe X-band link budget shows that 40 kbps can be achieved even if a 5 dB weather margin\n(rain + feed losses) is included. Statistical analysis of weather data for typical DSN\nstations indicates that for 99.9 percent of the time the weather would permit data rates in\nexcess of 40 kbps.\ni\nThe Giotto subsystem mass budget is shown in Table 8.\nTABLE 8.

During all mission phases the required ground stations will be connected to the\nEuropean Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt where the mission control will be\nexercised. For the 4-hour Halley encounter the Australian CSIRO institute has offered the use\nof its 64 m antenna at Parkes which is normally used for radio astronomy. This antenna can be\nlinked via satellite to the ESOC allowing transmission of data at a rate of up to 8 kbps. All\nreceived encounter data will be stored (at the full data rate) on magnetic tape at Parkes for\nlater dissemination to the experiments. At ESOC data will be separated three ways\no\no\no\n\nspacecraft housekeeping data for display on a VDU,\nexperiment science data for display on a VDU (quick-look facility),\noff-line computer for storage of sampled experiment data.\n\nThe quick-look facility will provide VDU sampled data display, data printouts, and first TV\nimages of the comet nucleus. This facility will accommodate for active participation of the\nexperimenters during critical experiment related mission sequences, especially during the\nencounter.\n8. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS\n8.1 Dust Particle Impacts\nDuring the Halley flyby. dust particles will impact on the spacecraft\'s leading surface\nwith a velocity of 68 km s~\' and particles with masses < 10~6 g could easily penetrate the\nspacecraft structure if it were unshielded. A cloud of debris would be formed inside the\nspacecraft. This cloud would expand inside and cause catastrophic damage to experiments and\nsubsystems.\nOutside ~ 100^000 km from the comet nucleus the possibility of dust particle impacts is\nnegligible. Even up to ~ 50 000 km the possibility of a dust particle with a mass > 10~6 g\nimpacting on the spacecraft is only 3 percent (N. Divine, private communication). Close to the\'\nnucleus, in particular, if the spacecraft passes the comet on the sunward side the possibility\nof large dust particle impacts increases dramatically and an unshielded spacecraft would be\ndestroyed many thousdands of kilometers before reaching the vicinity of the nucleus. Since the\nscientific return of the cometary mission is greatly enhanced if the spacecraft reaches the\ninner part of the coma, it is essential to shield the spacecraft.\n\n308\n\nSimply increasing the thickness of the leading surface leads to the following dilemma:\neither the spacecraft cannot be protected within a reasonable shield weight or the shield\nweight becomes excessive for any meaningful protection. A dual-sheet bumper shield is an ideal\nand in fact the only solution. This shield consists of a thin front sheet and a thick rear\nsheet with some space between. The front sheet breaks up the dust particle, the debris cloud\nexpands into the empty space between the two sheets and impacts on the rear sheet. It is\ndesirable to have a large separation between the two sheets in order to distribute the impact\nenergy over a wide area.\nThe present shield design envisages a 1.3 mm front sheet made out of aluminum and a 13 mm\nrear sheet made out of Kevlar, with a separation of 25 cm between the sheets. The total shield\nweight is ~ 60 kg.\nIt is essential for correct operation of the shield that the 25 cm between the two sheets\nis kept essentially free. No experiment sensor can be located in this region, particularly\nnone looking through the front sheet to the comet nucleus. Lightweight detectors for dust\nimpacts can however be accommodated on the front sheet, the associated electronics/power units\nbeing mounted on the equipment platform.\nTo calculate the probability of spacecraft survival in the innermost part of Halley, three\ndifferent mechanisms through which the spacecraft could be destroyed have been considered:\n1.\n\nIndividual large particles, whose debris cloud may not be completely vaporized and\nimpacts on the rear sheet tearing it.\n\n2.\n\nNumerous intermediate-sized particles, which produce holes in the front sheet, so that\na large fraction of its surface might disappear. A large particle might then impact\ndirectly on the rear sheet and its debris cloud would propagate into the spacecraft\'s\ninterior.\n\n3.\n\nA very large number of small particles, which produce craters in the front sheet,\nleading to its erosion. The front sheet would become thinner and thinner until holes\nwere produced (increasing hazard 2) or until the whole front disappeared.\n\nThe hazards due to these three mechanisms have been calculated and all lie in the range of\na few percent for a flyby at a distance of a few hundred kilometers. It is concluded that\nthere is a high probability that the spacecraft will survive the Halley encounter. (The\ndetails of the shield design, the Halley dust model, and calculations on the survival\nprobability can be found in the Comet Halley Micrometeoroid Hazard Workshop Proceedings, ESA\nSP-153).\n8.3 Spacecraft Plasma Environment\nAs the spacecraft approaches the comet nucleus cometary neutrals (atoms and molecules),\nions and dust particles impact on the front sheet of the bumper shield with a velocity of\n68 km s"!. At these high velocities the impacting primary atoms, molecules and ions cause\nthe emission of secondary neutrals and ions. It is estimated that one ion-electron pair is\nproduced-by each impacting-neutral -or ion molecule -if the front sheet material is aluminum.\nThe impacting dust particles are broken up into atoms by the impact energy and the atoms are\npartly ionized depending on the mass of the dust particle. For masses > 10-6 g the degree of\nionization is a few percent.\nThe impact-generated plasma around the spacecraft gives rise to a space charge cloud in\nfront of the spacecraft, causes a spacecraft potential, and presents a problem to cometary\nplasma measurements onboard Giotto since the density of the impact-generated plasma may be\norders of magnitude higher than that of the cometary ions. These adverse effects have been\nquantitatively calculated for the case of a fast flyby of Halley at 57 km s-1 and a\nheliocentric distance of 1.5 AU pre-perihelion (details of these calculations can be found in\nthe proceedings of the Halley Probe Plasma Environment Series of Workshops, ESA SP-155).\nFor the pre-perihelion flyby Figure 7 gives a comparison of total number of ion-electron\npairs produced by all dust particle impacts and the number of ions produced by impacting\ncometary neutrals assuming aluminum as front sheet material. Also shown for comparison is the\n309\n\nION PRODUCTION BY IMPACTS\nOF COMETARY NEUTRALS\n(AI-SHIELD)\n\nION-ELECTRON\nPAIRS BY DUST\nPARTICLE IMPACTS\n\nRANDOM IMPACTS OF\nCOMETARY ELECTRONS\n(3eV)\n\nPHOTO-ELECTRONS\n\nION PRODUCTION\nBY IMPACTS OF\nCOMETARY IONS\n(AI-SHIELD)\n\nCONTACT\nSURFACE\n\n10\n102\n\n103\n\nDISTANCE TO NUCLEUS (KM)\n\nFigure 7. Total production rate of ion-electron pairs by dust particle impacts and of ions\nby impacts of cometary neutrals. Using gold instead of aluminum as front sheet\nmaterials would reduce the ion production by impacts of neutrals by 3 to 4 orders of\nmagnitude, (after Gruen and Reinhard, 1981)\nnumber of ions generated by impacts of cometary ions (identical to the number of impacting\ncometary ions), the random flux of cometary electrons assuming a mean random kinetic energy of\n3 eV and, finally, the flux of photoelectrons. Evidently, the fluxes of the last three species\ncontribute negligibly at distances < 104 km from the nucleus and the main concern remains\nabout the ion production by cometary neutrals, since the flux of dust impact generated ions is\nonly an upper limit (most of the dust-impact-generated ion-electron pairs recombine before\nleaving the plasma cloud which is produced upon each dust particle impact).\nSince gold has a much lower ion production rate than aluminum for impacting neutrals the\nfront sheet material of the bumper shield is gold. On the other hand, gold has one of the\nhighest ion yields for dust particle impacts. Therefore, only a thin (10y) gold-coating with\nnegligible interaction and the ion-electron pair production by dust particles is primarily\ndetermined by the interaction of the dust particle with the aluminum, whereas the cometary\nneutrals only interact with the gold-coating.\n\n310\n\nOther measures to reduce the adverse effect of spacecraft charging include the provision of\nan equi-potential coating for the Giotto spacecraft in critical areas close to experiment\nsensors. It is expected that the spacecraft potential is low (~ + 20 V).\nFinally, although the density of the impact-generated plasma is orders of magnitude higher\nthan that of the cometary ions the adverse effects on detector background might be limited\nbecause the highest densities of the impact generated plasma are found above the front sheet\naway from the plasma sensors and, secondly, the impact-generated ions can be distinguished from\nthe cometary ions by their distinctively different velocity distributions (in the spacecraft\nframe of reference the distribution of cometary ions is centered at 68 km s~l while the\ndistribution of the impact-generated ions is at rest).\n9. SUMMARY\n\nAll major bodies of the inner solar system have been explored by spacecraft. Only the most\nremote planets are as yet beyond our reach. The exploration of the minor bodies, such as\ncomets, is the next natural step. From this we can expect new understanding of a kind that is\n\nFigure 8. Giotto spacecraft at experiment switch-on, a few hours before closest approach\nto the comet nucleus.\n311\n\nqualitatively different from that provided by4 the investigation of the planets. Of the minor\nbodies, comets are by far the least fractionated and the most active members of the solar\nsystem. Stimulated by insolation, the cometary nucleus believed to consist of ice mixed with\ndust particles (dirty snowball) with a size of only a few kilometers releases its material into\na coma, the outer fringes of which extend up to 10\xc2\xb0 km into space. Most of these processes\nhave been at best understood only in their phenomenological aspects. It is the comets\'\nactivity that makes them different from all other bodies, but it also prevents us from\nobserving their inner structure. Only in-situ measurements can provide the means to understand\nthe phenomena correctly and to assign the comets their appropriate place in the history of the\nformation of our solar system.\nHal ley\'s comet has been selected for ESA\'s first cometary mission because of its enormous\nactivity (comparable to "new" comets), its well-known orbit characteristics (29 returns), the\nlow launch energy requirements and its outstanding role in history.\nESA\'s Giotto mission plans for a launch in July 1985 with a Halley encounter in mid-March\n1986, ~ 4 weeks after the comet\'s perihelion passage. Giotto carries 10 scientific\nexperiments, a camera, neutral, ion and dust mass spectrometers, a dust impact detector system,\nvarious plasma analyzers, a magnetometer and an optical probe.\nGiotto is a spin-stabilized spacecraft based on a Geos design. It is equipped with a\ndual-sheet bumper shield to efficiently protect it from dust particle impacts in the innermost\npart of the coma, and with a high gain despun antenna allowing for a high data rate\ntransmission at 40 kbps. The encounter in the comet environment will last about 4 hours, the\nflyby velocity is 68 km s-1, the estimated flyby distance is 500 km or less. From this\ndistance the Giotto onboard camera will resolve nucleus surface structures down to less than 30\nm. Together with the Russian three-axis stabilized "Venera" spacecraft and the Japanese\n"Planet A" mission to Halley\'s comet Giotto will perform the first in-situ measurements at any\ncomet.\nREFERENCES\nBoissard, J.-B., S.
