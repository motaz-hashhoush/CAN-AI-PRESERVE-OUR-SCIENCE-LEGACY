Hope is offered by an automated unit, manufactured at Johns Hopkins University, called the Self-Injurious Behavior Inhibiting System (SIBIS). Components of SIBIS are stimulus module which is worn on upper arm or leg, and headgear which includes an impact detector and a transmitter on back of head. When there is a blow to the head it is sensed by impact detector which generates a coded signal that is automatically transferred to stimulus module which delivers a mild electrical stimulus to the skin for less than 1/10 of a second. Stimulus is sufficient to halt headbanging. Microprocessor computes impacts allowing measurement of patient progress.", "title": "Self Injury Inhibitor", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020086622, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020086622, "id": "d3dec248bd21435194f24ea5539af18a", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1988", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020086622.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020086622/downloads/20020086622.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020086622/downloads/20020086622.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020086622/downloads/20020086622.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
