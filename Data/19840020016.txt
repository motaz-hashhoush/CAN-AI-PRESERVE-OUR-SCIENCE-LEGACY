The tool consists\nprimarily of a hydraulic system composed of a fluid\nreservoir 11, a pumping piston 1 ,and an actuator pis6\nton 2 . Mechanical cutting jaws 28,29 are attached to\n6\nthe actuator piston rod 2 . The hydraulic system is\n6\ncontrolled by a pump handle 1 .As the pump handle 1\n8\n8\nis operated the actuator piston rod 26 is forced outward\nand thus the cutting jaws are forced together. The\nframe of the device is a flexible metal tubing 30 which\npermits easy positioning of the tool cutting jaws in\nremote and normally inaccessible locations. Bifurcated\ncutting edges 28a and 28b ensure removal of a section of\nthe tubing or cable ( 0 FIG. 3 to thereby reduce the\n4,\n)\npossibility of accidental reactivation of the tubing or\ncable being severed.\n\n6 Claims, 4 Drawing Figures\n\nJul. 10, 1984\n\n9\n\n458,4 1\n\n1\n\n4,45 8,4 1 8\n\nother and an elongated flexible \xe2\x80\x9cgooseneck\xe2\x80\x9d extension\nconnecting the two ends together and permitting selective placement of the cutting head in an operative posiORIGIN OF T H E INVENTION\ntion spaced from the pump.\nA more complete appreciation of the invention and\nThe invention described herein was made by employ- 5\nmany of the attendant advantages thereof will be better\nees of the United States Government and may be manuunderstood as the same becomes more apparent by\nfactured and used by or for the Government for governreference to the following detailed description when\nmental purposes without the payment of any royalties\nthereon or therefor.\nconsidered in connection with the accompanying draw10 ings, wherein:\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nThis invention relates to a hand held hydraulic cutting tool.
