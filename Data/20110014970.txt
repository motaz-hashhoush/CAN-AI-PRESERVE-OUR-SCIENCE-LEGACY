If verified and\nexploited, these volatiles will revolutionize spaceflight as an inexpensive source of propellants and other\nconsumables outside Earth\'s gravity well. This report discusses a preliminary investigation of a method\nto insert a sensor through such a soil/ice mixture to verify the presence, nature, and concentration of the\nice. It uses percussion to deliver mechanical energy into the frozen mixture, breaking up the ice and\ndecompacting the soil so that only low reaction forces are required from a rover or spacecraft to push the\nsensor downward. The tests demonstrate that this method may be ideal for a small platform in lunar\ngravity. However, there are some cases where the system may not be able to penetrate the icy soil, and\nthere is some risk of the sensor becoming stuck so that it cannot be retracted, so further work is needed.\nA companion project (lSDS for Water Detection on the Lunar Surface) has performed preliminary\ninvestigation of a dielectric/thermal sensor for use with this system.\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\nData from remote sensing and from the LCROSS mission indicate the existence of vast quantities of\nwater ice and other volatiles in the lunar regolith, frozen into the permanently shadowed craters near the\npoles. This will be game-changing because of the magnitude and importance of such a resource outside\nEarth\'s gravity well. It will be important to ground-truth these findings by putting an instrument into the\nlunar regolith to measure the ice content directly. This will be difficult to do with a small-class or\nmedium-class rover in the low lunar gravity because these platforms will not have adequate weight to\nprovide the necessary downforce. In the Apollo program, astronauts found it extremely difficult to push\ntubes into the dense, frictional lunar soil in 1/6 G. It will be even worse as we take core samples, anchor\nonto, and mine asteroids and small moons like Phobos, or mine icy soil on the Moon. Low-force\npenetration systems will be mandatory in all these situations.\nPrior work by Honeybee Robotics Spacecraft Mechanisms Corporation has shown that percussive\ncone penetrometers are capable of penetrating lunar regolith with only a small fraction of the force of an\nordinary penetrometer. This study asks the question whether percussion is a suitable method to insert\ninstruments into that regolith when it contains various quantities of water ice. We performed preliminary\nexperiments to measure penetration resistance in lunar soil simulant with varying quantities of water ice.\nWe also performed a demonstration of percussive penetration into a I-meter deep column of ice and soil\nmixtures in layers of varying proportions. One meter is the expected depth to reach the ice beneath the\ndesiccated upper layers of lunar soil. A companion study (lSDS for Water Detection on the Lunar\nSurface) has performed preliminary investigation of a dielectric/thermal sensor that may be inserted into\nthe regolith by this percussive penetration met~ to positively identify lunar ice. This system combining\nthe sensor with percussive penetration ha~otential to provide the first-ever ground truth of vast\nquantities of dense ice layers in the lunar regolith.\n\nExperiments\nThe experiments were performed jointly by Honeybee and NASA at the Kennedy Space Center\n(KSC). The percussive penetrator was provided and operated by Honeybee Robotics. The mixtures of\nlunar soil simulant and water ice were prepared by NASA/KSC. Descriptions of the hardware and\nexperiments are provided below.\n\nPercussive Cone Penetrometer\nOriginally we had planned to use both percussion and gas pulsing in the cone penetrometer. Further\nanalysis of the icy soil mixtures indicated that gas pulsing was not an appropriate approach due to the low\npermeability of ice-impregnated lunar soil and due to its extremely high mechanical strength. Therefore,\nthe gas pulsing approach was abandoned. For this effort, we used a percussive dynamic cone\npenetrometer originally developed under a separate Honeybee SBIR Phase 1 effort. In the configuration\ntested, this device delivers 2.6 Joules of percussive energy per blow at a frequency of approximately\n1500-1750 blows per minute. This device was originally designed as a geotechnical instrument: By\ndriving a cone into soil using a known percussive energy and recording the rate of penetration, soil\nstrength can be derived. This device is shown in Figure 1.\n\n8\n\nFigure 1. Honeybee Robotics percussive cone penetrometer.\n\nIce/Soil Mixtures\nLunar soil simulant JSC-1 A was used in this project to represent lunar soil. Carrier et al [1991] have\nsummarized the geotechnical properties of actual lunar soil without ice. The mechanics of JSC-1A\nwithout ice have been studied by Alshibli and Hasan [2009] and Zeng et al [2010]. The mechanics of the\noriginal version of this simulant, JSC-1, was reported by Klosky et al [2000]. No data have been returned\nfrom the Moon to indicate the mechanics of the soil with or without ice as it may be found in the\npermanently shadowed craters. Gertsch et al [2006] used JSC-1A in ice/simulant mixtures to\nexperimentally study the resistance to a surface indentor (chipping the surface) and found that resistance\nis a strong function of ice content. They reported that ice concentrations of 0.6 to 1.5% by mass behave\nlike weak shale or mudstone, whereas concentrations of 10.6% behave like strong limestone or sandstone\nand thus would be very difficult to excavate. Gamsky and Metzger [2010] used JSC-I A without ice on\nshake tables and in ovens and report that iceless regolith in the permanently shadowed craters may be less\ncompacted than elsewhere on the Moon due to the lack of the strong, localized, diurnal quakes to shake\ndown the soil and due to the lack of thermal cycling to directly compact it [Chen et ai, 2006]. We are\nunaware of any other studies addressing soil mechanics in the permanently shadowed craters. The JSC1A in this study was dried thoroughly in an oven and massed then monitored as it cooled and re-adsorbed\nhumidity in the laboratory environment. The percent mass of adsorbed water was not significant, so predrying was not performed for further sample preparation. JSC-IA was mixed with water in percentages\nranging between 0% and 8% by mass in 1% increments. The water/simulant mixtures were placed in\nlayers into six I-gallon cans (paint cans) as shown in Fig. 2 (left). Each can had three layers, the layer\nwith the greatest moisture content at the bottom. Each layer was tamped to compact it as it was laid\ndown. The moisture did not migrate significantly from their original layers to the adjacent layers due to\nthe relative impermeability of JSC-1A and because they were quickly frozen. Freezing was performed to60 0 C overnight. The cans were removed from the freezer for testing, and although some warming may\nhave occurred, it should have been small relative to the freezing point of water due to the large bulk of\nfrozen material. The cans are described in Table 1. A I-meter tall column, shown in Fig. 2 (right), was\nprepared in a similar manner with ten layers. The first and every other layer were dry (0% ice). The\ninterleaving layers were (from top to bottom) 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% water ice by mass, as shown in\nFig. 3. It was frozen at -60 0 C overnight.\n\n9\n\nFigure 2. (Left) Ice/soil can.

One-meter icy/soil column with fmal position of penetrometer.\n\nProcedure\nThe cone penetrometer was held as shown in Fig. 4 with the cone tip touching the sample can. On\nsome occasions, an effort was made to push it into the icy regolith without percussion but with moderate\ndownforce provided by the operator. For all samples, percussion was activated, providing 2.6 Joules per\nblow at about a 15 Hz repetition rate. Each can was penetrated using only the 61.7 N weight of the\npenetrator for downforce or sometimes using additional downforce provided by the operator pushing\ndown on the penetrometer\'s handles. In each case the can was sitting on an Acculab electronic mass\nscale, which provided a measurement of the downforce. Each penetration event, including the reading of\nthe mass balance, was video recorded. The rate of penetration was obtained post-test by observing the\nlength indicators on the shaft of the penetrator as they entered the ice/simulant mixture.\n\n11\n\nFigure 4. Penetration into sample can\n\nResults\nPenetration into cans # 1 and #2, which had ice contents between 0% and 5% by mass, was not\ndifficult. The percussive penetrator made progress under its own weight. The speed of penetration\ndecreased as the percent water content increased.\nIn the case of can #3, the percussive penetrator acting under its own weight achieved a maximum\ndepth of 7.5 cm, passing through the top layer and some portion of the second layer before progress\nhalted. The top few centimeters of icy regolith was broken into chunks as the cone passed through it.\nIncreasing down force was then applied by the operator. No further progress beyond this was possible\nwith only operator applied weight. Video shows that the sheet metal top surface of the mass scale was\nvibrating in response to the sample can. It is possible that this motion rendered the percussive cone less\neffective by absorbing some of the percussive energy. To investigate this, the can was moved to the floor\nnext to the scale. The percussive cone was operated with a large down force applied from 2 people\namounting to about 750 N. There was a small, barely perceptible additional penetration. This was also\ntried with the can back on the scale to measure the load with no further cone penetration noted.\nPenetration into the third layer, 6% ice, was not achieved. Figure 5 shows the depth versus time profile\nfor can #3, obtained from post-test video analysis. Figure 6 shows the downforce versus time profile.\n\n12\n\n--------------\n\nPercussive Cone 4,5,6% Ice JSC-la\na\n40\n\n20\n\n-1\n\n60\n\n10 o\n\n80\n\n-2\n\nE\n~\n\n-3\n\n~\n\n~\n\nc\n~\no\n\n-4\n\n\\.\n\n\xc2\xb75\n\n-ConeDepth\n\n~\n\nu\n\n-6\n\n-4%lceJSC-1a\n\n~\n\n-7\n-8\n\n-\n\n------\n\nS%lceJSC-1a\n\n-\n\nTIme to Depth (sec)\n\nFigure 5.

Downforce versus time for sample can #3.\n\nCan #4 performed similarly to can #3. The cone acting only under its own weight penetrated the first\nlayer at 6% ice and a portion of the second layer at 7% ice. Additional down force was applied\nmomentarily at ~300 seconds to see if further progress could be made. Minor additional penetration was\nachieved. After this the percussor frequency was increased to maximum without significant added\npenetration progress. Video shows that the sheet metal top surface of the mass scale was vibrating in\nreaction to the sample can. It is possible that this motion rendered the percussive cone less effective by\nabsorbing some of the percussive energy.

Shaft demonstrates depth of penetration.\n\nIn the case of can #5 with 100% water ice (no simulant), the penetrator fractured the ice, and the\nresulting large pieces moved apart or slid past each other as the cone moved deeper into the target. The\ncone penetrated to the bottom of the can much more quickly than it had penetrated the different mixtures\nthat contained lunar soil simulant. Figure 10 shows the fractured surface of can #5.\n\nFigure 10. Fractured surface of can #5 with 100% water ice.\n\n15\n\n------------\n\nIn the case of can #6 with 8% and higher water ice, the cone penetrated the surface but it did not do so\nby fracturing the top layer of icy regolith into chunks as before. The hole that the cone created in the icy\nregolith had very clean sides. Powdered material was observed on top of the target\'s original surface, and\nthis powdered material could be brushed aside to reveal the original surface. From this, we infer that the\ncone was pulverizing icy regolith and ejecting it from the resulting borehole though the force of its own\nvibration. When the borehole became too deep for the pulverized material to be ejected, progress came to\na halt.\nFor the I-meter column, the cone penetrated its entire length to a depth of 90.7 cm. The rate of\npenetration varied, and was observed to correspond with the layering as shown in Fig. II, where the\nslopes of the fitted linear segments are the penetration rates. The 8% slope is not valid since the cone was\non the container sidewall and the container was splitting, relieving the soil\'s stress. However, the\npenetrator did not maintain a straight vertical path, and struck the side of the column 67.2 cm below the\nsurface, or 2.6 cm into the 8% layer. We were unable to extract the penetrator from the frozen soil after\ndriving it in to its full depth.

Depth of penetration and downforce versus time for I-meter column.\n\n16\n\nFigure 12. Top surface of I-meter column with embedded penetrometer rod.\n\nDiscussion\nIce Content\nIn general we find as expected that, in the range of 0% to 10% ice content by mass, the greater ice\ncontent is more resistant to penetration. However, it is interesting that the top layer of can #4 with 6% ice\ncould be penetrated, whereas the second layer of can #3 with only 5% ice could not be penetrated. Thus,\nwe found that it is not simply the percentage of ice that matters, but whether the fracturing ice has room to\nmove into the surrounding volume. In the case of top layers, there was always room at the free surface\nfor fractured chunks of ice to move upward. In the second and deeper layers of the cans, the ice could not\nalways fracture and move. Thus, a lower percentage of ice at depth could resist penetration whereas a\nhigher percentage of ice at the surface could not.\nThe mechanics are apparently different than the case of penetration into dry regolith. Dry regolith is\nfree to rearrange at the grain-scale to make room for the penetrator. The strain field of cone penetration\ninto ordinary, terrestrial sands and soils has been studied in detail (see for example [Tumay at aI, 1985]\nand [Acar and Tumay, 1986]), indicating soil motion (of decreasing amplitude) at long distances from the\ncone. Furthermore, comminution of the individual grains allows their material to move into the pore\nspaces between other grains, increasing the bulk density of the material around the penetrometer to make\nthe room. For frozen soils, however, the grains cannot move individually, and comminuted material may\nnot be able to move into pore spaces between neighboring grains. Therefore, to make room for a cone\nand rod, the frozen soil must exhibit a combination of pulverization with powder removal and fracturing\nwith relative motion of the fractured domains. As long as the cone is near the surface of the icy regolith,\npowder could exit the downshaft around the sides of the rod, and likewise near the surface the fractured\ndomains could move upward above the free surface of the sample.\n\n17\n\n--\n\n---------\n\nFor the small sample cans with three layers of icy/soil mixture, when the ice content was sufficiently\nhigh the cone could not penetrate through the second layer because it was trapped between the overlying\nand underlying frozen layers. For sample cans #1 and #2 this was not a problem. Presumably the low ice\ncontent did not stop the soil from deforming at the grain scale to densify within each layer, or to push into\nthe neighboring layers that then deformed at the grain scale to absorb the additional volume of material.\nTherefore, it appears that the transition in penetration mechanics occurs somewhere in the range of 3% to\n5% ice content by mass.\nFor sample can #5 with 100% water ice, the soil did fracture but was able to rearrange all the way to\nthe bottom of the can, permitting the penetrator to reach the bottom. Apparently, the ice has less friction\nthan an ice/regolith mixture, and thus the fractured chunks even deep in the can are able to push the\nfractured chunks above them out ofthe way.\nFor the case of the I-meter column, the fractured domains could make room by expanding into the\ninterleaving dry layers of regolith. A fractured domain expanding into neighboring space would\npresumably experience more resistance if it were moving into dry regolith than if it were moving into\nempty space above the free surface of the sample, as was the case with the top layers of the smaller\nsample cans. However, the dry regolith did not produce enough resistance to stop this penetration as\nevidenced by the cone passing successfully through layers of up to 10% ice. To make room for adjacent\nfractured domains, the dry regolith layers must have densified through the ordinary processes discussed\nabove for cone penetration. However, in this experiment only half the volume of the column was dry\nregolith whereas the other half was icy. Half the domain must have been adequate to absorb the full\nvolume of the penetrating cone and rod.\nBased on these results, it is likely that bulk volumes of greater than 4-6% ice (by mass) will be\nresistant to percussive cone penetrometers unless a method is developed to remove pulverized material.\nFortunately, the instrument that will go onto the cone, which is being developed in the companion project,\nis capable of detecting and measuring ice content at concentrations less than these values. Also, since the\npercussive penetrometer can always penetrate at least the top few centimeters of material higher than 46% (since the fractures can expand upward into the material that has less ice), the system is guaranteed to\nenter at least that concentration of ice even if no modifications are made. If the lunar ice lies beneath a\nmeter of desiccated soil, or soil that contains less than 4-6% ice, or layers less than a few centimeters\nthick of any concentration interleaved by layers less than 4-6% ice, then the system will successfully pass\nthrough it to the bulk quantities of more concentrated ice. In any case, when it finds the bulk of the more\nconcentrated ice, it should penetrate several centimeters. Therefore, the delivery method appears to be\nsuccessful but with room for increased performance.\n\nPenetration Rate\nThe penetration rate was not a strong function of downforce. In most cases it was a strong function\nonly of the ice content. Therefore, penetration rate may serve as a useful secondary measurement of ice\ncontent to corroborate what is measured by the primary instrument. By comparing the primary\ninstrument\'s [mdings with the penetration rate, it may also be possible to back out information about the\ncompaction of the soil and thus the volume of pore space not occupied by frozen volatiles. This may\nsupport analysis of the permeability of the regolith and modeling of ice stability and transport\nmechanisms.\nIt makes sense that penetration rate would be dependent on ice content. The ice must be fractured or\npulverized to permit movement of material to admit the cone. The more volume ice there is bonding the\nsoil grains together, the more energy that must be expended to break those grains apart. Thus, more\npercussive blows are needed to free equivalent volumes of regolith when there is more ice. Penetration\ncould be sped up by increasing the percussion rate, but (as seen with can #4) if the blows are incapable of\nmoving material, then increasing their frequency will not restore motion.\n\n18\n\nOn the other hand, toward the bottom of the I-meter column, increased downforce did help\npenetration (see "Download" curve on Fig. 11). This might be because the fracturing ice layers deep in\nthe column needed to be mechanically pushed into the neighboring volumes of dry regolith. Because the\nlarge chunks would be moving dry regolith far away from the percussing cone, their motion relied upon\nthe direct downforce. Thus, there is additional information available by analyzing both downforce and\npenetration rate together that may indicate the structure of ice layers beneath the surface.\n\nRetracting the Rod\nIn the one test with the I-meter column, the rod could not be retracted. This may have been due to\nthe fact that the rod became bent as it struck the wall of the column, but other factors may have\ncontributed. For example, the base diameter of the cone is larger than the diameter of the rod, and\ncompacted JSC-I a can exert high friction on a rod that has been driven into it. There is also some\nconcern that ice could freeze to the cone or shaft. The instrument on the cone will have a heater element\nto enable volatilization of the ice as a part of measuring its concentration. The heater element could serve\na secondary function of de-icing the regolith around the cone or shaft to help free it. Also, the team has\nindentified mechanical changes to the design ofthe system to enable easier retraction.\n\nSummary of Findings\n1. A percussive cone can penetrate icy regolith at ice concentration layers that a static cone cannot\npenetrate. The percussive penetrator was able to penetrate material under 65 N of downforce\nthat the static cone could not penetrate under full body weight.\n2. The percussive cone could penetrate:\na. 100% water ice (-60 C);\nb. dry soil that is compacted and cold (-60 C);\nc. ice/soil mixtures up to 4-6% ice by weight (note that 5% ice is more resistant than 100%\nice) with much less resistance than non-percussive;\nd. mixtures with 6% and 8% ice as long as there is a free surface above the layer to allow\nthe icy chips room to move;\ne. a little more than a cone-length into the top surface of mixtures that have 8% or more ice;\nf. completely through layers of 8% ice as long as they are interleaved with dry layers to\nallow the icy chips room to move.\n\n3. These percentages of ice are within the range that can be detected by the sensor developed in the\ncompanion project, "ISDS for Water Detection on the Lunar Surface." Therefore, the system\nis capable of penetrating deeply enough into the regolith to detect ice.\n4. The ability of a percussive cone to displace material affects its ability to penetrate material. The\ndevice proved capable of penetrating material with 8% ice, but did not penetrate very far\nbecause it could not displace the resulting chip. A certain amount of material must be displaced\nfor the cone to advance.\n5. Increased downforce on the percussive system did not result in increased penetration capability.\nIn hard material, the percussive penetrator made no more progress under 750 N than it did\nunder 65 N. This suggests that increasing the energy delivered in each percussive blow would\nbe a more effective than increasing downforce for penetrating stronger materials. When the ice\n\n19\n\nis too dense, pushing harder will not make it penetrate.\npenetrates or doesn\'t.\n\nThe percussive system either\n\n6.\n\nThere may be cases with layers of ice interleaved by dry regolith in which increased downforce\nhelps move the fractured ice and thus increases penetration rate, but this condition is not the\nbaseline expectation for lunar regolith. If such a condition does exist on the Moon, then it can\nbe detected by measuring both penetration rate and downforce to corroborate other instruments\non the cone.\n\n7.\n\nA percussive cone can become stuck in frozen regolith. For anchoring, this is beneficial. A rod\ndriven in under 65N (15 Ibs) of downforce could not be pulled out with at least that much\nforce. For repeated probing, this must be addressed.\n\nConclusions\nThis investigation successfully demonstrated percussive penetration of regolith with varying ice\nconcentrations. It demonstrated that percussive penetration is feasible in situations where non-percussive\nis not. It successfully demonstrated penetration to a meter in depth, which is the expected depth to lunar\nice. It demonstrated that the device is capable of entering ice concentrations that are easily within the\nmeasurement range of instruments that will go on the cone. This serves as experimental proof-of-concept\nof the critical function, and so percussive insertion of lunar ice instruments has now achieved Technology\nReadiness Level 3.\nThe experiments developed preliminary correlation data between penetration rate and ice content, and\nthus the data from the penetration process can be used to corroborate the findings of another sensor. This\nproject also produced insights into the mechanics ofthe penetration resistance of ice and ice/soil mixtures.\nIt provided an opportunity to develop and test methods to prepare ice/soil mixtures for mechanical testing.\nIt provided insights into how to improve the test stands and hardware. It also indicated a number of\nmodifications that may be made to improve the penetration system, which will be the subject of on-going\nprojects.\n\n20\n\nReferences\nAcar, Yalcin B., and Mehmet T.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES\n\nN/A\nRecent data from the Moon, including LCROSS data, indicate large quantities of water ice and other volatiles\nfrozen into the soil in the permanently shadowed craters near the poles. If verified and exploited, these volatiles will\nrevolutionize spaceflight as an inexpensive source of propellants and other consumables outside Earth\'s gravity well. This\nreport discusses a preliminary investigation of a method to insert a sensor through such a soiVice mixture to verify the\npresence, nature, and concentration of the ice. It uses percussion to deliver mechanical energy into the frozen mixture,\nbreaking up the ice and decompacting the soil so that only low reaction forces are required from a rover or spacecraft to push\nthe sensor downward. The tests demonstrate that this method may be ideal for a small platform in lunar gravity. However,\nthere are some cases where the system may not be able to penetrate the icy soil, and there is some risk ofthe sensor becoming\nstuck so that it cannot be retracted, so further work is needed. A companion project (ISDS for Water Detection on the Lunar\nSurface) has performed preliminary investigation of a dielectric/thermal sensor for use with this system.\n14. ABSTRACT\n\n15.
