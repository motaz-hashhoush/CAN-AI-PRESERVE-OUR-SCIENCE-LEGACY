The derivation of the equations on which the flow coefficients are based is given. The distribution of total pressure in the arms of the sleeve-valve intake manifold was measured. The arms are found to have as little as 75 percent of the total pressure within the manifold entrance.", "title": "Flow coefficients of monosleeve valves", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:31:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930091795, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Waldron, C D"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "3f2b0dc0dac640c7aa734953c2937897"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930091795, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930091795, "id": "79d7edaeda3e4d12a5946212e1de7f4f", "publicationDate": "1941-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930091795.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930091795/downloads/19930091795.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930091795/downloads/19930091795.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930091795/downloads/19930091795.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
