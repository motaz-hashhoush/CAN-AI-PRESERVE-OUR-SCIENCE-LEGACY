b'BS Network Operations & Security\nWestern Governors University\nGraduation Date: 12/20/2019\n\nZero Trust Network Security\nLawrence Coulter\n\nWhat?\n\nMore traditional approaches tended to automatically trust\nconnections that come from inside the network perimeter.\nUnder traditional approaches, if the device is connected to the\ncenter\xe2\x80\x99s network, it has access to the everything on the\nnetwork.\nThe Zero Trust approach to network security involves not\nautomatically trusting anything. The device has to be\nwhitelisted to gain access to the network.\nNASA is ultimately taking this to the application (software)\nlevel, meaning a device that wants to use licensed software\nneeds to be explicitly authorized to do so. This could save the\nagency millions in fines and avoids the introduction of\nmalicious software.\n\nIT & Communications Services\nIT Security (IT-B)\nNetwork Security Perimeter\n\nMentor: Bryan Boatright, IT-B\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you on the list?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen?\n\nWhy?\n\nNAC (Network Access Control) Portion:\n4th Quarter, FY 2019 Authentication credentials assigned to devices\n\nThe number of ways a user could inflict damage to the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of the network is\nalmost innumerable once they have a foot in the door.\nThey could use that basic level of access to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Transmit sensitive data outside the secure perimeter\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Download malware (intentionally or inadvertently)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Gain access to restricted files through privilege escalation\nand steal, modify, or delete them.\n\n4th Quarter, FY 2019 New NASA Visitor Network Is Turned Up.\n4th Quarter, FY 2019 NAC Enforcement Activities Begin In Earnest.\n3rd Quarter, FY 2020 NASA Target For NAC Enforcement Completion.\nFuture iterations should bring the Agency closer to a true Zero Trust model.\n\nUnder a Zero Trust approach a device has to have been\napproved before gaining any kind of access to the network. If\nthe device has been approved but engages in foul play anyway,\nit is much easier to track down the offending device and\nremediate that situation.\n\nNetwork Access Control (NAC):\n\nThis is the initial stage on the long road to a zero trust environment.\nRegardless of how a user accesses the network, the architecture will\ncheck if the device is allowed on the network at all, and if so, which\nportion of the network may be accessed. If NAC would give you access to\na room, Zero Trust restricts your access to the drawer and cabinets in the\nroom, and watch you while you\xe2\x80\x99re accessing them.\n\nAnalogies:\n\nIn this way, different devices are placed in the appropriate environments\nand limited in what they can access. For example, devices that belong to\nvisitors, the personal devices of NASA employees and contractors, and\nuntrusted devices can be connected directly to the Internet and be kept\nfar away from NASA\xe2\x80\x99s internal network.\n\nTraditional Network Connection: A public building \xe2\x80\x93 once you\xe2\x80\x99re inside you can go pretty much anywhere.\nNetwork Connection w/ Password: All you have to do to enter the speakeasy is know the right password to give to the doorman and\nthen you can go anywhere.\nNetwork Access Control: A royal wedding \xe2\x80\x93 if you\xe2\x80\x99re not on the guest list, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting in and if you\xe2\x80\x99re press you\xe2\x80\x99re limited to a\ncertain area.\nZero Trust: A sensitive research facility \xe2\x80\x93 even if your badge gets you in the building, it won\xe2\x80\x99t let you in every room.\n\nPrevious Experience:\n\nService Desk (Tech Support) -> Overnight Service Provisioner and \xe2\x80\x9dFirst Responder\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNASA_visitor\n\nNASA\n\nSSID\n\nSSID\n\nSocket Telecom \xe2\x80\x93 Regional ISP, Telephone, and IPTV provider\n\nDesktop Support Technician -> Network/VOIP Lead\nSinclair Research \xe2\x80\x93 Preclinical Research Facility (AALAC, GLP, SEND, FDA)\n\nWebauth,\nMAB\n\n802.1X\n\nDevice Registry\n+ NAC Rules\nNAMS\nGuest Account\n\nCurrent Tasks:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nConfiguring equipment in the IT Security lab to enable testing of IPv6 security solutions in advance of wider\ndeployment.\nEstablishing secure configurations on IT Security lab equipment.\nExplored government compliant options for sanitizing systems prior to being excessed.\nSecurely excessing surplus HDDs.\n\nOther\nFederal devices\n\nVisitor devices\n\nProtected IoT\n\nTIC\n\nX\n\nNASA UD (BYOD)\nUntrusted IoT\nSelf-regi\nid.nasa.gov\n\nNASA devices\n\nInternet\n\nDevice\nAdmin\n\nPartner devices\n\n'
