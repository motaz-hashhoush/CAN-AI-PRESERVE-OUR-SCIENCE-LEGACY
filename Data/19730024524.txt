GSFC ID No. of P. I. : IN 023\nc. No substantive problems are impeding the progress of the\ninvestigation.\nd. As part of ERTS-1 experiment SR 251,plans were comoleted early in\nApril for a spring series of aerial thermal infrared surveys over\nselected volcanic sites in the northern Cascade Range, utilizing a\nU.S. Forest Service fire-control aircraft from Missoula, Montana.\nFor this mission, priority was given to selected traverses over Mt.\nBaker, Mt. Adams, Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Hood, and Mt. Rainier.\nAs a result of this mission, on April 29, 1973, between 0400\nand 0552 PDT, aerial infrared thermographic imagery was obtained over\nsix northern Cascade Range volcanoes, using an RS-7 scan system.\nNo radiation anomalies were found for Glacier Peak and Mt. Adams.\n\nThe\n\nsouthwest slope anomaly of Mt. St. Helens in the Crums Hot Rocks area\nyielded a much better thermal infrared registration than previous\nflightsas a result of carefully selected flight altitudes and V/H\nsettings.\nsnow cover.\n\nHowever, the Boot Ridge thermal area does not show, owing to\nSeveral small, previously unknown, point-source radiation\n\nanomalies were detected in the extensive steam fields on Mt. Hood and\nMt. Baker which, otherwise, were registered as on earlier infrared,\nthermographic imagery.\n\nThe summit crater anomalies of Mt. Rainier\n\nappear as on earlier imagery, but with better spatial resolution.\n\nThe\n\nwarmest areas appear to be the inside northwest rim of the East Crater,\nthe outside northwest rim of the West Crater, and the outside southwest\nslope of the West Crater.\n\nThe most outstanding result of the April 29th\n\nI\n\nsurvey flights, however, was the detection of approximately 48 previously\nunrecorded pinpoint radiation anomalies around the main cone and on the\nflanks of Mt. Rainier between 10,000 and 13,000 feet elevation, in outcrop\nareas of andesite of Mount Rainier volcano (Fiske and others, 1963, USGS\nProf. Paper 444, Plate 1).\n\nThese anomalies are nearly All point sources\n\nwith no dimension, appearing warmer than surrounding bedrock, but not as\nwarm as the summit anomalies.\noverpass.\n\nThey were registered on more than one\n\nThey cannot be attributed to geothermal emission without a\n\nfield check, though they are located on slopes and rock walls difficult\nof access.\n\nOn May 13th, David Frank was able to reach the ground location\n\nof one of these anomalies (A1 , on our map compilation) at Disappointment\nCleaver and found 27 m2 of warm ground at that location.\n\nThere, he\n\nmeasured vapor temperatures of 580 C at two vent openings, using PRT-10\nradiometer and thermometer.\n\nAdjacent ground surface temperatures were\n\n18-30 0C, and, at 50 cm depth, 540 C.\nSee also Section k for installation of Data Communication Platform\n(DCP) set #6166 at Mt. St. Helens, Washington.\ne.\n\nThere are three significant scientific results of the discovery of\n\nthe above-mentioned (Section d) 48 pinpoint anomalies on the upper flanks\nof Mt. Rainier.\n\n(1) Many of these points may actually be the location of\n\nfumarolic vapor emission or warm ground considerably below the summit\ncrater, (2) Discovery of these small anomalies required specific V/H\nscanner settings for precise elevations on Mt. Rainier\'s flank, to avoid\nsmearing the anomalies to the point of nonrecognition.\n\nSeveral past\n\nmissions flown to map the thermal anomalies of the summit area did not\n\n2\n\ndetect the flank anomalies; (3) this illustrates the value of the aerial\nIR scanner as a geophysical tool suited to specific problem-oriented\nmissions, in contrast to its more general value in a regional or\nreconnaissance anomaly-mapping role.\nf.
