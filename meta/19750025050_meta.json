The operation of the following DCS commands accepted and processed by the flight program was tested: time base update, navigation update, generalized switch selector, memory dump, terminate, execute generalized maneuver, return to nominal timeline, ECS water control valve logic inhibit, execute maneuver, execute alternate sequence, targeting load, ladder magnitude limit, S-IVB/IU de-orbit, compressed data dump, and remove inhibit on the extraction maneuver.", "title": "Digital command system", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T02:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19750025050, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750025050, "id": "54d4835ad10044f5a768676a6e2bf95e", "publicationName": "Program Verification Doc. for the ASTP Flight Program", "publicationDate": "1975-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19750025041, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Program verification document for the ASTP flight program", "stiType": "CONTRACTOR_REPORT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
