To meet this need, Diversified Scientific, Inc. (DSI), with the support of a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract from NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center, developed CrystalScore(trademark), the first automated image acquisition, analysis, and archiving system designed specifically for the macromolecular crystal growing community. It offers automated hardware control, image and data archiving, image processing, a searchable database, and surface plotting of experimental data. CrystalScore is currently being used by numerous pharmaceutical companies and academic and nonprofit research centers. DSI, located in Birmingham, Alabama, was awarded the patent Method for acquiring, storing, and analyzing crystal images on March 4, 2003. Another DSI product made possible by Marshall SBIR funding is VaporPro(trademark), a unique, comprehensive system that allows for the automated control of vapor diffusion for crystallization experiments.", "title": "Protein Crystal Growth", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T10:23:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030099660, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030099660, "id": "c4e2c97efd9f40bc844b8b3e6936d6a1", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2003: 100 Years of Powered Flight", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20030099639, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 2003: 100 Years of Powered Flight", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030099660.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030099660/downloads/20030099660.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030099660/downloads/20030099660.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030099660/downloads/20030099660.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
