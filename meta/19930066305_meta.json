The system consists of three elements, a sensor array, a signal processing unit, and a diagnostic processor. The sensor array consists of discrete solid state sensors which are located at specific potential leak sites and in potential leak zones. The signal processing unit provides excitations power for the sensors and provides analog to digital data conversion of the sensor signals. The diagnostic computer analyzes the sensor outputs to determine leak sources and magnitude. Leak data from the sensor network is interpreted using knowledge based software and displayed on-line through a graphical user interface including 3-D leak visualization. The system requirements have been developed assuming eventual application to the Space Shuttle Main Engine which requires approximately 72 measurement locations. A prototype system has been constructed to demonstrate the operational features of the system. This system includes both prototype electronics and data processing software algorithms. Experiments are in progress to evaluate system operation at conditions which simulate prelaunch and flight. The prototype system consists of a network using 16 sensors within a testbed which simulates engine components. Sensor response, orientation, and data analysis algorithms are being evaluated using calibrated leaks produced within the testbed. A prototype flight system is also under development consisting of 8 sensors and flight capable electronics with autonomous control and data recording.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19930066305, "endDate": "1993-06-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "ASME"}}, "meetingId": "9446134d7b62491485b53252c04cee9a", "id": "700ae07ccc4e4f36b5348153442b16dc"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "SAE"}}, "meetingId": "9446134d7b62491485b53252c04cee9a", "id": "77b8daed678d42d79cfd51abee0562e3"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AIAA"}}, "meetingId": "9446134d7b62491485b53252c04cee9a", "id": "6dc90eb22adb4ce2adecd60aee10a28a"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "ASEE"}}, "meetingId": "9446134d7b62491485b53252c04cee9a", "id": "8fb89e7b3d2c422586774a7889bc7a9f"}], "name": "AIAA, SAE, ASME, and ASEE, Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit", "location": "Monterey, CA", "id": "9446134d7b62491485b53252c04cee9a", "startDate": "1993-06-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930066305, "id": "daa2a8bddd8447bdba4c1e5e2d73528a", "publicationDate": "1993-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
