b'E\xef\xac\x80ects of Step Shape on Transition over a Swept\nBackward-Facing Step\nJenna L. Eppink\xe2\x88\x97\nNASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA 23681\nThe e\xef\xac\x80ect of backward-facing step shape on stationary-cross\xef\xac\x82ow growth was studied downstream of a two-dimensional step in a swept-wing \xef\xac\x82ow. The step height was set at 76% of the\nlocal unperturbed boundary-layer thickness at the step location, and the shape was varied by\nplacing three ramps of di\xef\xac\x80ering slopes and shapes on the downstream face of the step, including a 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, rounded ramp, and a 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp. In addition, the square step shape (with no\nramp) was studied. The 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp was the only one that was successful at substantially delaying\ntransition downstream of the step. Even so, it did not completely mitigate the e\xef\xac\x80ect of the step.\nThe 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp signi\xef\xac\x81cantly altered the mean \xef\xac\x82ow, signi\xef\xac\x81cantly reducing the separation region\ndownstream of the step. While this geometry still resulted in increased growth of the stationary\ncross\xef\xac\x82ow instability, it substantially reduced the amplitude of the unsteady instabilities that\ngrew downstream of the step. In particular, this ramp completely eliminated the low-frequency,\ntraveling cross\xef\xac\x82ow mode that was observed in the other cases.\n\nNomenclature\nc\nCp\n\n=\n=\n\nchord length, m\nPressure coe\xef\xac\x83cient, Cp =\n\nf\nh\nRe\nTu\nU, V, W\nu, v, w\nU\nU\xe2\x8a\xa5\nu ,v ,w\nur ms, wr ms\nUe\nU\xe2\x88\x9e\nx\nxc\nxs\ny\nz\nz\n\xce\xb4\n\xce\xbbz\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nfrequency, Hz\nstep height, mm\nUnit Reynolds number, m\xe2\x88\x921\nturbulence intensity\nmean boundary layer velocity in the x, y, and z -directions, m/s\nvelocity components in the x, y, and z directions, m/s\nsteady disturbance velocity, m/s\nmean velocity in xc direction, m/s\n\xef\xac\x82uctuating components of velocity, m/s\ntemporal root mean square of u , w , m/s\nboundary-layer edge velocity, m/s\nfreestream velocity, m/s\nstreamwise direction\ndirection normal to the leading edge\nstreamwise location of the step\nwall-normal direction\nspanwise direction (parallel to the leading edge)\ndirection normal to side wall\nboundary-layer thickness, mm\nspanwise wavelength, mm\n\n\xe2\x88\x97 Research\n\np\xe2\x88\x92p\xe2\x88\x9e\n1\n2\n2 \xcf\x81U\xe2\x88\x9e\n\nAerospace Engineer, Flow Physics and Control Branch, M.S. 170, AIAA Member\n\n1\n\nI. Introduction\nhe utilization of laminar \xef\xac\x82ow control (LFC) to improve aircraft fuel e\xef\xac\x83ciency is an ongoing challenge. Increasing\nthe amount of laminar \xef\xac\x82ow on a vehicle surface can be quite e\xef\xac\x80ective at reducing drag in theory and in the laboratory.\nHowever, real-world applications result in additional di\xef\xac\x83culties that can be detrimental if not well-managed. Disruption\nof laminar \xef\xac\x82ow can occur if small protuberances or surface imperfections are present on the wing surface. These\nimperfections can result from insect residue, rivets, bolts, steps, gaps, paint, and other sources. In order for LFC to be\ne\xef\xac\x80ective in an operational environment, it is crucial that we understand how surface irregularities a\xef\xac\x80ect transition. If\nwe do not have a clear understanding of the allowable surface excrescence sizes, reasonable manufacturing tolerances\ncannot be speci\xef\xac\x81ed.\nA better understanding of the mechanisms that cause transition when the surface imperfections are present is crucial\nto enable development of better prediction models for acceptable roughness levels. The transition mechanisms will\nvary depending on the type of surface imperfection. While di\xef\xac\x80erent approaches exist for estimating critical roughness\nheights [1\xe2\x80\x939], they are all either empirical or semi-empirical models that depend upon the speci\xef\xac\x81c con\xef\xac\x81guration being\ntested. Historically, these con\xef\xac\x81gurations were primarily limited to two-dimensional (i.e., unswept) \xef\xac\x82ows. Somewhat\nrecently, researchers have begun to study two-dimensional excrescences in three-dimensional \xef\xac\x82ow \xef\xac\x81elds. This work is\noften limited to observing the behavior of the transition front as the step height is increased [9\xe2\x80\x9311], but more recently,\nresearchers have begun to study the \xef\xac\x82ow in more detail. Duncan et al. [12] performed hotwire measurements downstream\nof forward- and backward-facing steps to determine the e\xef\xac\x80ect of the steps on stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instabilities. They\nfound that the steps caused an increase in the growth of the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow vortices. The forward-facing step (FFS)\ncaused a larger growth of the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow than the backward-facing step (BFS). Tufts et al. [13] performed\ncomputations to study the interaction between stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instabilities and a two-dimensional step excrescence.\nThe backward-facing step (BFS) was found to have little in\xef\xac\x82uence on the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instability, but some\nunsteady instabilities were destabilized. Similarly, Eppink et al. [14] found that backward-facing steps caused only\na small localized increase in stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow amplitude downstream of reattachment, but the primary transition\nmechanism was related to the unsteady instabilities, while the FFS caused a large growth in the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow\namplitude [15]. Saeed et al. [16] also found that, downstream of a two-dimensional strip, unsteady disturbances in the\n\xef\xac\x82ow\xef\xac\x81eld led to earlier transition.\nMost of the previous work has dealt with square steps; however, it is common wind tunnel practice to mitigate the\ne\xef\xac\x80ect of steps by fairing them in. Additionally, it has been shown in previous experiments in two-dimensional (unswept)\n\xef\xac\x82ows, that one can delay transition, or increase the critical step height, by shaping the step. Holmes et al. [1] discussed\n\xef\xac\x82ight test results showing that rounded steps and ramped steps could increase the critical step-height Reynolds number\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cantly compared to square steps of the same step height. While this knowledge is useful, it is also bene\xef\xac\x81cial to\nperform detailed experiments to better understand the mechanisms that occur when a ramp or step is introduced into the\n\xef\xac\x82ow. Eppink and Casper [17] experimentally studied the e\xef\xac\x80ect of forward-facing step shape on transition, testing a\nsquare step, a 45\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, and a 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp. The 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp was successful at mitigating the e\xef\xac\x80ect of the step, while the 45\xe2\x97\xa6\nramp was only partly successful. The current study applies the same approach to study the e\xef\xac\x80ect of step geometry for\nbackward-facing steps. The experimental setup is described in Section II, followed by a discussion of the results in\nSection III. The discussion will \xef\xac\x81rst consider the e\xef\xac\x80ect of step shape on the mean \xef\xac\x82ow (Section III.A), followed by a\ndiscussion of the impact on the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instability (Section III.B), and, \xef\xac\x81nally, the unsteady instabilities\n(Section III.C).\n\nT\n\nII. Experimental Setup\nThe experiment was performed in the 2-Foot by 3-Foot Low Speed Boundary-Layer Channel at the NASA Langley\nResearch Center. The tunnel is a closed circuit facility with a 0.61-m high by 0.91-m wide by 6.1-m long test section.\nThe tunnel can reach speeds up to 45 m/s (Re = 2.87 x 106 /m) in the test section. Freestream turbulence intensity\n1\nlevels, Tu = U\xe2\x88\x9e 1 (u 2 + v 2 + w 2 ), were measured using a crosswire in an empty test section to be less than 0.06% for\n3\nthe entire speed range of the tunnel, and less than 0.05% for the test speed of 26.5 m/s. This value represents the total\nenergy across the spectrum, high-pass \xef\xac\x81ltered at 0.25 Hz. Thus, this tunnel is considered a low-disturbance facility for\npurposes of conducting transition experiments [18].\nThe 0.0127-m thick \xef\xac\x82at plate model consists of a 0.41-m long leading edge piece, swept at 30\xe2\x97\xa6 , and a larger\ndownstream piece (see Fig. 1). The model is 0.91 m wide (thus, spanning the width of the test section) and 2.54 m long\non the longest edge. The downstream or leading edge pieces can be adjusted relative to each other using precision shims\nto create either forward-facing or backward-facing 2D steps of di\xef\xac\x80erent heights, parallel with the leading edge. The\n\n2\n\nleading edge piece was polished to a surface \xef\xac\x81nish of 0.2 \xc2\xb5m, and the larger downstream plate had a surface \xef\xac\x81nish of 0.4\n\xc2\xb5m. A leading-edge contour was designed for the bottom side of the plate in order to make the suction-peak less severe,\nand therefore, avoid separation, which could potentially cause unsteadiness near the leading edge on the test surface.\nA 3D pressure body along the ceiling was designed to induce a streamwise pressure gradient, which, along with the\nsweep, causes stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow growth. A second purpose of the ceiling liner was to simulate in\xef\xac\x81nite swept-wing\n\xef\xac\x82ow within a midspan measurement region of width 0.3 meters. This was achieved by designing the liner such that the\nCp contours were parallel with the leading edge within the measurement region. The ceiling liner was fabricated out of\na hard foam using a computer-controlled milling machine.\nAll measurements were performed at a freestream velocity of 26.5 m/s (Re = 1.69 x 106 /m). The current experiment\nutilized a single leading-edge roughness con\xef\xac\x81guration consisting of discrete roughness elements (DREs) with a diameter\nof 4.4 mm. These DREs correspond to the large DRE case studied previously [14]. The DREs were applied with a\nspanwise spacing, \xce\xbbz , of 11 mm and were approximately 20 \xc2\xb5m thick. The spacing of the DREs (11 mm) corresponds\nto the most ampli\xef\xac\x81ed stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow wavelength calculated for the baseline case with no step. For more details of\nthe experiment setup, refer to Eppink [19].\nA high-speed, double-pulsed, Nd:YLF laser provided the laser sheet for the particle image velocimetry (PIV)\nmeasurements (see Fig. 1). The laser sheet was set up parallel with the leading edge and the backward-facing step.\nTwo high-speed, 4-megapixel cameras were used to acquire the time-resolved PIV (TRPIV) measurements and were\nplaced downstream of the step. One was placed on the outboard side of the test section at approximately 30\xe2\x97\xa6 to the laser\nsheet, and the second camera was placed on the inboard side (in backward scattering) at an angle of approximately\n45\xe2\x97\xa6 to the laser sheet (Fig. 1). To achieve the desired \xef\xac\x81eld of view and resolution, 300 mm lenses were utilized,\nresulting in a total possible measurement area of approximately 60 mm x 30 mm. For the majority of the measurements,\nthe area of interest was reduced to approximately 60 mm x 8 mm to obtain an acquisition rate of 2 kHz. This area\nallowed acquisition of approximately \xef\xac\x81ve wavelengths of the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instability in a single frame, while\nstill acquiring approximately 30 points (using 75% overlap and 16x16 pixel interrogation size) inside the boundary\nlayer. For the mean \xef\xac\x82ow measurements, data were acquired starting about 9 mm upstream of the step, and moving\ndownstream in approximately 1 mm increments. Five hundred image pairs were acquired at each location. For the\nhigh-speed measurements, 10,000 image pairs were acquired at 4.7 kHz, with the area of interest reduced to 40 mm x 7\nmm. These image pairs were processed using a 32x32 pixel interrogation size. The high-speed measurements were only\nperformed at limited locations, due to the extra time required for acquiring and processing the data. The cameras and\nlaser were all mounted on the same traversing system, which allowed measurements at multiple locations with relative\nease. An oil-based fog machine generated the seeding, which was introduced downstream of the test section.\nTotal Field of View\nAOI for ~2 kHz\ny, V\n\n60 mm\n\nx, U\nz\xe2\x80\x99, W 30\xc2\xb0\n\n30 mm\n8 mm\n\ny\n\nz\n\n60 mm\n\nxc,U\xe2\x8a\xa5\n\nWcf\n\nz, W||\n\nU\xe2\x88\x9e\n\nStep\n\nxsh\n\nInviscid\nstreamline\nFig. 1\n\nSketch of model coordinate system and TRPIV setup.\n\nA single backward-facing step height of nominally 1.83 mm was studied, including a square step, along with two\nramps of nominally 30\xe2\x97\xa6 and 5\xe2\x97\xa6 , as well as a circular rounded shape. These shapes are depicted in Fig. 2. The square step\nwas achieved using the method described above, by inserting precision shims underneath the upstream plate. Ramps\n\n3\n\nwere added downstream of the square step to create the ramped and rounded shapes. The shapes were created using a\npolyjet 3D printing technique. The shapes were targeted for a 1.7 mm step height, but the step height of 1.83 mm was\nultimately chosen due to the sensitivity of the \xef\xac\x82ow to any overhanging pieces.\n\nRounded ramp\n\n30\xc2\xb0 ramp\n\nSquare step\nU\xe2\x88\x9e\n\nU\xe2\x88\x9e\n\nU\xe2\x88\x9e\n\n1.83 mm\n\n1.83 mm\n\n30\xc2\xb0\n\n1.83 mm\n\n3.17 mm\n\n1.83 mm\n\n5\xc2\xb0 ramp\n\nU\xe2\x88\x9e\n1.83 mm\n\n5\xc2\xb0\n20.91 mm\n\nFig. 2\n\nSketch of step geometries studied.\n\nIII. Results and Discussion\nIn the previous study [14], backward-facing step heights ranging from 0.86 mm to 1.17 mm were examined in\ndetail. The critical step height was found to be approximately 1.17 mm, meaning that at or above this step height,\ntransition moved upstream relative to the no-step case. Contrary to the forward-facing steps, the backward-facing\nsteps resulted in only a small local increase in the stationary-cross\xef\xac\x82ow amplitude, occurring for a short distance\ndownstream of the reattachment location. However, three di\xef\xac\x80erent types of unsteady disturbances were identi\xef\xac\x81ed,\ncorresponding to traveling cross\xef\xac\x82ow (80-200 Hz), Tollmien-Schlichting (200-800 Hz), and shear-layer (800-1500 Hz)\ninstabilities. These unsteady instabilities were found to be ultimately responsible for transition, though the amplitude of\nthe stationary-cross\xef\xac\x82ow vortices was found to play a secondary role in transition through the modulation of the unsteady\ndisturbances, which slightly accelerated transition as the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow amplitude was increased. The step causes\nmajor changes to the mean \xef\xac\x82ow, which are believed to play important roles in the interaction and destabilization of both\nthe stationary-cross\xef\xac\x82ow vortices and the unsteady instabilities. As was seen for the forward-facing steps, contouring or\nshaping the steps should reduce the impact on the mean \xef\xac\x82ow, especially on separation, and thus should mitigate the\ne\xef\xac\x80ect of the step on the instabilities. The current work was undertaken to study this e\xef\xac\x80ect. Results have been acquired\nfor a square step, for ramps with nominal angles of 30\xe2\x97\xa6 and 5\xe2\x97\xa6 , and for a circular rounded ramp. Note that the step\nheight of 1.83 mm is signi\xef\xac\x81cantly larger than the previously studied largest height of 1.17 mm. The ramps were initially\nfabricated for use with a forward-facing step geometry, for which the critical step height is larger. Since the ramps\nalready existed, we decided to utilize them to study a backward-facing step of the same height.\nThe transition behavior of the ramps was studied using naphthalene \xef\xac\x82ow-visualization. The results are shown in\nFig. 3. The images have been post-processed to remove the sweep and distortion, and a grid was overlaid to help identify\nthe transition location. The black triangle in the lower left corner is a consequence of the limited view of the camera\nthrough the small window. The step is identi\xef\xac\x81ed by the red line, the \xef\xac\x82ow is from bottom to top, and the streamwise\nlocations on the right are the streamwise distances downstream of the step, x \xe2\x88\x92 xs (see Fig. 1). Note that even though\nthe image is unswept, the distances listed are still the streamwise distances, in order to be consistent with the values used\nthroughout the paper. The white regions indicate areas of laminar \xef\xac\x82ow, since the naphthalene remains on the surface due\nto the lower shear stress. Naphthalene \xef\xac\x82ow-visualization results must be interpreted with caution, since the results may\nvary slightly unless one is extremely consistent with how much naphthalene is applied and how long the tunnel is run.\nAdditionally, since the sublimation rate is really a function of wall shear stress, more naphthalene on the surface could\nbe an indication of \xef\xac\x82ow separation in addition to laminar \xef\xac\x82ow. Thus, the results should be interpreted in the context of\nother, more reliable, measurement techniques. Nonetheless, the results are still useful for obtaining a general and more\nglobal idea of the transition behavior. The square step results in transition shortly downstream of the step, at x \xe2\x88\x92 xs \xe2\x89\x88 22\nmm, or x/c \xe2\x89\x88 0.168. These transition locations were estimated from the images based on an average across the span.\n4\n\nThe 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp did not have much e\xef\xac\x80ect on the transition front; transition occurred at approximately the same streamwise\nlocation as for the square step. The rounded ramp appears to have slightly delayed transition (by a few millimeters) for\nparts of the span, however, given the small di\xef\xac\x80erence and the caution given above about interpreting these results in a\nquantitative manner, the di\xef\xac\x80erence is not large enough to draw \xef\xac\x81rm conclusions. Given that the 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp resulted in\npractically no change to the transition location, the 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp was tested next, even though a 15\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp was also fabricated.\nThe 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp resulted in a signi\xef\xac\x81cant transition delay, with the average transition location occurring around x \xe2\x88\x92 xs =198\nmm, or x/c=0.238. Note that the baseline case (no step), which is not shown here, resulted in transition downstream of\nx/c=0.48. Thus, while the 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp is successful in signi\xef\xac\x81cantly delaying transition, it is still not able to completely\nmitigate the e\xef\xac\x80ect of the step. It is interesting to compare this case to the FFS, for which the 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp was successful at\nmitigating the e\xef\xac\x80ect of the step [17]. Clearly, a signi\xef\xac\x81cantly longer ramp is required to mitigate the e\xef\xac\x80ect of a BFS.\n\nSquare step\n\n30\xc2\xb0 ramp\n\nRounded ramp\n\n5\xc2\xb0 ramp\n\nx-xs=\n356 mm\n\n204 mm\n\n52 mm\nstep\n\nFig. 3\n\nNaphthalene \xef\xac\x82ow-visualization results.\n\nA. Mean Flow E\xef\xac\x80ects\nThe e\xef\xac\x80ect of the step and ramps on the mean \xef\xac\x82ow are shown in Fig. 4. These \xef\xac\x81gures show the \xef\xac\x82ow component\nnormal to the leading edge (U\xe2\x8a\xa5 ), normalized by the local edge velocity (Ue ). The white contours indicate regions of\nreversed (or negative) \xef\xac\x82ow. There is not a signi\xef\xac\x81cant di\xef\xac\x80erence between the square step, 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, and rounded ramp\ncases. This is not very surprising, considering that the transition front was not changed signi\xef\xac\x81cantly for these cases. The\nstrongest region of reversed \xef\xac\x82ow occurs approximately 30 mm downstream of the step, followed by reattachment by\nx \xe2\x88\x92 xs \xe2\x89\x88 38 mm. The 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, however, has a signi\xef\xac\x81cant e\xef\xac\x80ect on the mean \xef\xac\x82ow. The reversed \xef\xac\x82ow region is almost\ncompletely gone; there are only some weak remnants of recirculation visible between the edge of the ramp at x \xe2\x88\x92 xs =\n20, and reattachment near 35 mm. Because the reversed \xef\xac\x82ow region downstream of a backward-facing step is so long,\nand the strongest part (i.e., largest reversed \xef\xac\x82ow velocity) occurs immediately upstream of reattachment, it is apparently\nnecessary to use a ramp that is long enough to interact with this region, in order to have any signi\xef\xac\x81cant e\xef\xac\x80ect on the \xef\xac\x82ow.\nThe e\xef\xac\x80ect that the step has on the cross\xef\xac\x82ow component inside the boundary layer is illustrated in Fig. 5 for all cases.\nThis is the velocity component inside the boundary layer that is normal to the external inviscid streamline. The normal\ncross\xef\xac\x82ow direction (i.e., that which occurs in the baseline case) is negative in the de\xef\xac\x81ned coordinate system (see Fig. 1).\nFor the square step, 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, and rounded ramp cases, a region of positive cross\xef\xac\x82ow occurs near the wall, below the\nregion of negative cross\xef\xac\x82ow. This positive cross\xef\xac\x82ow region corresponds approximately with the reversed \xef\xac\x82ow region,\nthough it extends approximately 5 mm farther downstream. The separation and cross\xef\xac\x82ow reversal are both caused by\nthe adverse pressure gradient downstream of the step. Cross\xef\xac\x82ow reversal results in an additional in\xef\xac\x82ection point in\nthe velocity pro\xef\xac\x81le, and can cause the destabilization of stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow vortices that are rotating in the direction\nopposite to the initial primary vortices. The 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp results in signi\xef\xac\x81cantly weaker regions of both negative and positive\ncross\xef\xac\x82ow. Again, the cross\xef\xac\x82ow-reversal region behaves similarly to the separated region, though it extends slightly\nfarther upstream and downstream.\n\n5\n\n1\n\n5\n\n1\n\n4\n\n0.8\n\n4\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n3\n\n0.4\n2\n\ny (mm)\n\ny (mm)\n\n5\n\n0.6\n\n3\n\n0.4\n2\n0.2\n\n0.2\n1\n0\n\xe2\x88\x920.\n2\n\n\xe2\x88\x920\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.0\n2\n\n.0\n4\n\n1\n\xe2\x88\x920\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.02\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.04\n.04\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.0\n\xe2\x88\x922\n\xe2\x88\x920.0.04\n06\n\xe2\x88\x92\n\xe2\x88\x920.00.06\n4\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.06\n\n02\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\n0\n\nU \xe2\x8a\xa5 /U \xe2\x8a\xa5 e\n\n0\n\n20\n\n0\n40\n\n60\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\nU \xe2\x8a\xa5 /U \xe2\x8a\xa5 e\n\n(b) 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp.\n\n(a) Square step.\n5\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n4\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n3\n\n3\n\n0.4\n2\n\ny (mm)\n\n1\n\n4\n\ny (mm)\n\n5\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n2\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\xe2\x88\x92\n\xe2\x88\x920.06 0.02\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.04\n\n0\n\n20\n\n0\n40\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\n60\n\nU \xe2\x8a\xa5 /U \xe2\x8a\xa5 e\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.0\n\n06\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.0\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.04\n\n06\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n20\n\n40\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\n60\n\nU \xe2\x8a\xa5 /U \xe2\x8a\xa5 e\n\n(d) 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp.\n\n(c) Rounded ramp.\n\nFig. 4 Spanwise-averaged U\xe2\x8a\xa5 -pro\xef\xac\x81les downstream of each step.

Stationary Cross\xef\xac\x82ow Growth\nThe e\xef\xac\x80ect of the step on the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instability is examined in Fig. 6. The U-perturbation pro\xef\xac\x81les\nare calculated from the RMS of the steady disturbance velocity (U ) across the span. The wavelength spectra are\nintegrated across a wavelength range of 5 to 20 mm. The steady disturbance velocity (U ) is the time-averaged velocity\nat each location minus the spanwise-averaged velocity at the same wall-normal location. Downstream of the square\nstep (Fig. 6a), the incoming (upper) peak decays by about 30 mm downstream of the step, and a second peak forms\nbelow this upper peak, starting at approximately 20 mm downstream of the step. This lower peak eventually grows to\namplitudes near 3% Ue before decaying. This short region of growth and decay in stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow amplitude is\nsimilar to that seen through the hot-wire measurements performed for the lower step heights [14]. The growth of the\nlower peak is caused by the appearance of a second in\xef\xac\x82ection point in the Wc f pro\xef\xac\x81le, which comes about through the\ncross\xef\xac\x82ow reversal. Similar behavior was seen for the FFS [17], though the e\xef\xac\x80ect in that case was much larger due to the\nstronger in\xef\xac\x82ection point. It is very interesting to note that, despite only minor di\xef\xac\x80erences in the mean \xef\xac\x82ow in Figs. 4\nand 5, the rounded ramp case (Fig. 6c) results in noticeably di\xef\xac\x80erent behavior of the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow mode. In\nthis case, the incoming (upper) peak continually grows downstream of the step. The initial growth is fairly weak, and\nthen, similar to the square step case, there is a stronger, but short, region of growth and decay shortly downstream of\nreattachment. There is a lower peak that starts to become apparent at x \xe2\x88\x92 xs \xe2\x89\x88 30 mm, but it decays shortly after it\nappears. The behavior of the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instabilities downstream of the 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp is fairly similar to that of the\nrounded ramp case. The upper peak maintains its initial amplitude from just upstream of the step, until approximately\n30 mm downstream of the step, where the amplitude begins to gradually increase. The pro\xef\xac\x81le also starts to broaden as\nthis upper peak moves closer to the wall, probably due to the in\xef\xac\x82uence of the cross\xef\xac\x82ow reversal region near the wall.\nThe stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow amplitude continues to grow steadily downstream of reattachment.\n6\n\n5\n0.1\n4\n\ny (mm)\n\n0.05\n3\n0\n2\n\xe2\x88\x920.05\n1\n\xe2\x88\x920.1\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\nW c f /U e\n\n(b) 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp.\n\n(a) Square step.\n5\n\n5\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n4\n\n4\n0.05\n\n3\n\ny (mm)\n\ny (mm)\n\n0.05\n\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n2\n\xe2\x88\x920.05\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.05\n1\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.1\n\n\xe2\x88\x920.1\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\n0\n\n60\n\nW c f /U e\n\n20\n\n40\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\n60\n\nW c f /U e\n\n(d) 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp.\n\n(c) Rounded ramp.\n\nFig. 5\n\n0\n\nSpanwise-averaged cross\xef\xac\x82ow velocity (Wcf ) downstream of each step.\n\nTwo di\xef\xac\x80erent approaches are used to quantify the amplitude of the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instability in Fig. 7. The\n\xef\xac\x81rst approach is to simply take the peak amplitude from the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow pro\xef\xac\x81le at each streamwise location\n(Fig. 7a). Using this approach, there appears to be a decrease in amplitude for the square step and 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp cases\nstarting near 10-20 mm downstream of the step, before a sharp increase in amplitude occurs. The rounded ramp case\ngrows steadily, initially, at a similar rate to the no-step case, before increasing sharply near 40 mm downstream of the\nstep. The 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp case grows steadily, initially at a rate similar to the no-step and rounded ramp cases, with a steadily\nincreasing growth rate. The square step, rounded ramp, and 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp cases all saturate in amplitude between 40 and\n60 mm downstream of the step, likely due to the fact that the boundary layer is becoming turbulent at this point. The\nsecond approach to quantifying the amplitude of the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instability is to integrate across the entire\n\xe2\x88\xab\n1 \xce\xb4\npro\xef\xac\x81le: Ur ms,tot = \xce\xb4 0 Ur ms (y) \xe2\x88\x82 y. This takes into account the energy contained in the double-peaked pro\xef\xac\x81les, which\notherwise is neglected when only picking out the peak amplitude. These results are shown in Fig. 7b. With this measure\nof amplitude, there is no initial decay in amplitude for the square step and 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp cases. Rather, most cases appear to\ngrow at a relatively slow rate shortly downstream of the step, though the growth rate for the rounded ramp case is higher\nthan all the others.\nIn all cases, the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow grows at a higher rate downstream of reattachment relative to the baseline\n(no-step) case, even though the maximum cross\xef\xac\x82ow velocity is similar to or even lower than in the baseline case. One\npossible explanation for this increased stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow growth is that the streamlines begin to exhibit concave\ncurvature as the \xef\xac\x82ow recovers from the e\xef\xac\x80ect of the step. It has been shown that concave streamline curvature is\ndestabilizing for stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instabilities [20]. Additionally, convex curvature has been shown to be stabilizing\nfor stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instabilities [21], which might explain the reduction in amplitude of the upper lobe (i.e., the\nincoming stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow instabilities) shortly downstream of the square step and 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp.\n\n7\n\n5\n\n0.03\n0.025\n\n4\n\ny (mm)\n\n0.02\n3\n0.015\n2\n0.01\n1\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\n0\n\xe2\x80\xb2\nU r m s /U e\n\n(b) 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp.\n\n(a) Square step.\n5\n\n0.03\n\n5\n\n0.025\n\n4\n\n0.03\n0.025\n\n4\n\n0.02\n\ny (mm)\n\ny (mm)\n\n0.02\n3\n0.015\n2\n\n3\n0.015\n2\n\n0.01\n1\n\n0\n\n0.01\n1\n\n0.005\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\n0\n\n0\n\xe2\x80\xb2\nU r m s /U e\n\n0.005\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\n0\n\xe2\x80\xb2\nU r m s /U e\n\n(d) 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp.\n\n(c) Rounded ramp.\n\nFig. 6 U-perturbation pro\xef\xac\x81les downstream of each step.\n0.05\n\n0.025\n\n0.045\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0.035\n0.03\n\n0.015\n\n0.025\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n0.015\n0.01\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0.005\n-20\n\n120\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n(a) Urms based on peak stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow am- (b) Urms based on integrated stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow\nplitude.\namplitude.\n\nFig. 7\n\nComparison of stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow growth.\n\nThe behavior of the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow modes downstream of the step is explored further in Fig. 8, in which\ncontours of the stationary disturbance velocity (U ) are shown at several di\xef\xac\x80erent streamwise locations for the square\nstep case. Upstream of the step, the mode looks like a normal stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow mode, but by 26 mm downstream of\nthe step, it has developed the double-peaked structure, as evident from the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow pro\xef\xac\x81les shown in Fig. 6a.\nThere is a clear phase shift of close to 180\xe2\x97\xa6 between the upper and lower sets of U disturbances. By 32 mm downstream\nof the step (Fig 8c), the phase shift between the upper and lower disturbances has diminished signi\xef\xac\x81cantly, and the\n8\n\ntwo are starting to merge. The lower set of disturbances likely occurs due to the presence of the positive cross\xef\xac\x82ow\nregion near the wall. Similar behavior was seen downstream of a forward-facing step [15]. The behavior upstream and\ndownstream of the 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp is shown in Fig. 9. In this case, the double-peaked behavior is not evident downstream of\nthe step. Rather, the initial U -disturbances upstream of the step slowly migrate closer to the wall, as the amplitude\nincreases steadily.\n\n(a) x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = -5 mm.\n\nFig. 8\n\n(c) x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 32 mm.\n\nSpanwise planes of U -contours at di\xef\xac\x80erent streamwise locations for the square step.\n\n(a) x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = -5 mm.\n\nFig. 9\n\n(b) x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 26 mm.\n\n(b) x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 26 mm.\n\n(c) x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 32 mm.\n\nSpanwise planes of U -contours at di\xef\xac\x80erent streamwise locations for the 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp.\n\nC. Unsteady Disturbances\nThe most important aspect of the \xef\xac\x82ow for backward-facing steps, at least when it comes to transition, is the e\xef\xac\x80ect of\nthe step shape on the unsteady disturbances. In a previous study, unsteady disturbances were found to be the primary\ncause of transition for swept backward-facing steps [14], though the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow played a role through the\nmodulation of the unsteady disturbances. Figure 10 shows spanwise-averaged pro\xef\xac\x81les of the \xef\xac\x82uctuating RMS velocity\n(ur ms ) for each of the cases. The \xef\xac\x82uctuations for the square step case start the earliest, near 30 mm downstream of the\nstep. The \xef\xac\x82uctuations for the 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp and rounded ramp start shortly downstream of that location, but also very near\n30 mm. Downstream of the 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, \xef\xac\x82uctuations are just starting to become visible near 70 mm downstream of the step.\n\n9\n\n5\n\n0.12\n0.1\n\n4\n\ny (mm)\n\n0.08\n3\n0.06\n2\n0.04\n1\n\n0.02\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\n0\n\nu \xe2\x80\xb2r m s /U e\n\n(b) 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp.\n\n(a) Square step.\n5\n\n0.1\n\n0.08\n\n4\n\n0.08\n\n3\n\n0.06\n\n3\n\n0.06\n\n2\n\n0.04\n\n2\n\n0.04\n\n1\n\n0.02\n\n1\n\n0.02\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\n60\n\ny (mm)\n\n0.1\n\n4\n\ny (mm)\n\n5\n\nu \xe2\x80\xb2r m s /U e\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nx \xe2\x88\x92 x s (mm)\n\n80\n\n0\nu \xe2\x80\xb2r m s /U e\n\n(d) 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp.\n\n(c) Rounded ramp.\n\nFig. 10\n\n0\n\nSpanwise-averaged \xef\xac\x82uctuating velocity pro\xef\xac\x81les (urms ) downstream of each step.\n\nTo give an idea of the spatial layout of the ur ms \xef\xac\x82uctuations, planform views of ur ms contours at y=1.5 mm are\nshown in Fig. 11 for the square step and 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp cases. In these \xef\xac\x81gures, the black lines indicate regions of reversed\n\xef\xac\x82ow near the wall. In the case of the square step, the \xef\xac\x82uctuations begin near x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 30 mm, as indicated from the\nspanwise-averaged ur ms pro\xef\xac\x81les. This is about 10 mm upstream of the reattachment location. As the \xef\xac\x82uctuations develop\ndownstream, they become modulated at the primary stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow wavelength (i.e., 11 mm). The \xef\xac\x82uctuations\nspread in the spanwise direction until, near 60 mm downstream of the step, the modulations are no longer clearly visible,\nlikely because the \xef\xac\x82ow has become nearly or fully turbulent by this point. The 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp exhibits very di\xef\xac\x80erent behavior.\nExtremely localized regions of \xef\xac\x82uctuation start to develop by around 40 mm, or shortly downstream of reattachment,\nbut only between z=-10 to 10 mm. Farther downstream, near x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 60 mm, localized \xef\xac\x82uctuations are observed for\nz <-20 mm. This indicates that the transition mechanisms may be somewhat di\xef\xac\x80erent between these two cases.\nFig. 12 shows velocity spectra taken at several di\xef\xac\x80erent locations for each of the four cases. These spectra were\naveraged across the span at a speci\xef\xac\x81c y-location. This y-location varied from case to case, but was chosen as the point\nat which the ur ms amplitude was the largest. Before the spanwise averaging was applied, the power spectral densities at\neach point were computed using a hanning window with a 50% overlap and 40 block averages, resulting in a frequency\nresolution of 9.4 Hz. For the square step, 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, and rounded ramp cases, this y-location was typically close to y=1.5\nmm, while for the 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp case, the y-location of the maximum amplitude was typically closer to the wall, at y=1 mm.\nSome di\xef\xac\x80erences are visible in the spectra. In general, the square step, 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, and rounded ramp cases exhibit\nsimilar features in the spectra, however, the amplitude of the \xef\xac\x82uctuations are generally slightly higher in the square\nstep case. This indicates that the slight changes in the mean \xef\xac\x82ow due to the di\xef\xac\x80erent ramp geometries do have a slight\nmitigating e\xef\xac\x80ect on the unsteady instabilities. Note that the \xef\xac\x81rst spectra shown for the square step case is 10 mm\ndownstream of that shown for the rounded ramp and 30\xe2\x97\xa6 cases. Unfortunately, the data acquired at x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 14 mm\nfor the square step case were too noisy to generate good spectra. At x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 14 mm, there is a very strong peak near\n100 Hz, which corresponds to the traveling cross\xef\xac\x82ow instability identi\xef\xac\x81ed in previous hot-wire measurements [14].\nAt x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 24 mm, a high-frequency peak near 1000 Hz starts to become apparent.

These peaks grow and broaden as the \xef\xac\x82ow progresses downstream. At\nx \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 44 mm, it is beginning to look as though the \xef\xac\x82ow is nearing the fully turbulent state. The 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, however,\nresults in substantial changes to the unsteady instabilities, as illustrated in Fig. 12d. Not only are the \xef\xac\x82uctuation\namplitudes lower, but the peak frequencies have also shifted. There are still two peaks generally visible in the spectra,\nparticularly at the two most upstream locations. However, the lower peak occurs at around 200 Hz, and the upper peak\noccurs at approximately 500 Hz.

Then, to produce cleaner results, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) [22, 23] was performed on each\nof the bandpass-\xef\xac\x81ltered datasets. Finally, the data were reconstructed using the \xef\xac\x81rst 10 POD modes. Results for the\nsquare step case at x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 24 mm are shown in Fig. 13. Results are shown for three frequency bands, and at two\ndi\xef\xac\x80erent time steps for each frequency band. These time steps were chosen appropriately for the given frequency band\nin order to show the time-dependent behavior of the mode. The lowest frequency band, seen in Figs. 13a and 13d,\nis a primarily spanwise traveling mode, with a relatively large wavelength (approximately 40-50 mm). The middle\nfrequency band, seen in Figs. 13b and 13e, passes through the spanwise plane, and can be seen as alternating waves of\npositive and negative velocity. There is some spanwise modulation already evident at this streamwise station. Finally,\nthe highest frequency band, shown in Figs. 13c and 13f, is very highly modulated in the spanwise direction. It also\nexhibits movement primarily in the out-of-plane direction, though there also appears to be some spanwise (in-plane)\nmotion as well. The behavior of this mode is quite complex and it is di\xef\xac\x83cult to determine exactly how it is behaving\nfrom two-dimensional results. For brevity, results for the 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp and rounded ramp cases are not shown, but, they\nexhibit similar behavior in each of the frequency bands. These results are all consistent with the hot-wire measurements\nreported previously [14].\n\n(a) f = 80 to 200 Hz, t = t0 .\n\n(b) f = 300 to 800 Hz, t = t0 .\n\n(c) f = 1000 to 1500 Hz, t = t0 .\n\n(d) f = 80 to 200 Hz, t = t0 +0.002 s\n\n(e) f = 300 to 800 Hz, t = t0 +0.001 s\n\n(f) f = 1000 to 1500 Hz, t = t0 +0.0004 s\n\nFig. 13\n\nBandpass-\xef\xac\x81ltered and POD-reconstructed data for the square step, x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 24 mm\n\nSimilar results for the 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp are shown in Fig. 14, but slightly farther downstream at x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 34 mm. In this case,\nonly two distinct peaks were observed in the spectra, so only two frequency bands are shown. The lower frequency\nband, seen in Figs. 14a and 14c, exhibits behavior similar to the middle frequency band for the square step case. This\nmode appears to be passing through the plane, with alternating positive and negative velocity \xef\xac\x82uctuations. The higher\nfrequency band, shown in Figs. 14b and 14d is a bit more complex. Similar to the higher-frequency band for the square\nstep case, this mode is also highly modulated in the spanwise direction, but it still primarily appears to be passing through\nthe plane. In this case, there is no longer any evidence of the existence of the lower frequency, spanwise-traveling mode,\nas seen in the square step case.\n\n12\n\n(a) f = 130 to 250 Hz, t = t0 .\n\n(b) f = 250 to 950 Hz, t = t0 .\n\n(c) f = 130 to 250 Hz, t = t0 +0.001 s.\n\n(d) f = 250 to 950 Hz, t = t0 +0.001 s.\n\nFig. 14\n\nBandpass-\xef\xac\x81ltered and POD-reconstructed data for the 5\xe2\x97\xa6 , x \xe2\x88\x92 xs = 34 mm\n\nD. Summary and Concluding Remarks\nSeveral di\xef\xac\x80erent step shapes for a nominally 1.83 mm backward-facing step were studied to determine the e\xef\xac\x80ect on\ntransition. These included a square step, 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, rounded ramp, and 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp. The square step, 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, and rounded\nramp all resulted in fairly similar results downstream of the step, though transition appears to have been slightly delayed\nby the rounded ramp. The 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp caused a signi\xef\xac\x81cant delay of transition relative to the square step case; however,\neven this gradual of a slope was not enough to completely mitigate the e\xef\xac\x80ect of the step. A large separated region was\nobserved downstream of the square step, which was not noticeably mitigated by either the 30\xe2\x97\xa6 or rounded ramp. The 5\xe2\x97\xa6\nramp, however, did have a signi\xef\xac\x81cant e\xef\xac\x80ect on the recirculating region downstream of the step.\nThe square step, 30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp, and rounded ramp all caused a localized increase in the growth of the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow\nmode, starting near reattachment. The peak amplitude for these cases was only near 2 to 4% Ue , so stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow\nwas not the primary cause of transition for these cases. Rather, large amplitude unsteady instabilities destabilized\nby the step were measured downstream of the step and were the primary cause of transition. Downstream of the 5\xe2\x97\xa6\nramp, the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow mode continued to grow at an increased rate compared to the baseline case and reached\namplitudes of near 5% Ue by 100 mm downstream of the step. Transition did not occur until approximately 200 mm\ndownstream of the step for this case, and measurements were not performed this far downstream. However, since\nvelocity \xef\xac\x82uctuations were starting to become apparent in some localized regions by 60 mm downstream of the step, it is\nlikely that a combination of the stationary cross\xef\xac\x82ow and unsteady instabilities were responsible for transition in this case.\nA comparison of the unsteady disturbances downstream of the steps and ramps revealed that the rounded ramp and\n30\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp caused only a slight decrease in the amplitude of the unsteady disturbances. However, the general character of\nthe disturbances remained similar. The 5\xe2\x97\xa6 ramp resulted in signi\xef\xac\x81cantly lower amplitude \xef\xac\x82uctuations downstream of the\nstep. In addition, this ramp appears to have completely eliminated the lower frequency spanwise-traveling disturbance\nthat was prevalent in the other cases.\nIt is evident from these results that the step shape can be modi\xef\xac\x81ed to mitigate the e\xef\xac\x80ect of a backward-facing step\n\n13\n\non transition. However, the initial results show that a much longer ramp is necessary to have any signi\xef\xac\x81cant e\xef\xac\x80ect on\nthe \xef\xac\x82ow when compared to a forward-facing step of the same height. The reason for this appears to be the length of\nthe separation region. Downstream of a backward-facing step, the ramp needs to be long enough to interact with and\nprevent the strong separated region from forming. This helps to mitigate the unsteady instabilities that otherwise lead to\ntransition shortly downstream of the step.\n\nReferences\n[1] Holmes, B., Obara, C., Martin, G., and Domack, C., \xe2\x80\x9cManufacturing Tolerances for Natural Laminar Flow Airframe Surfaces,\xe2\x80\x9d\nSAE Paper 850863, 1985.\n[2] Fage, A., \xe2\x80\x9cThe smallest size of a spanwise surface corrugation which a\xef\xac\x80ects boundary layer transition on an aerofoil,\xe2\x80\x9d R.&M.\nNo. 2120, British A.R.C., 1943.\n[3] Carmichael, B., \xe2\x80\x9cSurface Waviness Criteria for Swept and Unswept Laminar Suction Wings,\xe2\x80\x9d Norair Report No. NOR-59-438\n(BLC-123), 1959.\n[4] Sedney, R., \xe2\x80\x9cA survey of the e\xef\xac\x80ects of small protuberances on boundary-layer \xef\xac\x82ows,\xe2\x80\x9d AIAA Journal, Vol. 11, 1973, pp. 782\xe2\x80\x93792.\n[5] Tani, I., \xe2\x80\x9cBoundary-layer transition,\xe2\x80\x9d Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 1, No. 1, 1969, pp. 169\xe2\x80\x93196.\n[6] Nenni, J., and Gluyas, G., \xe2\x80\x9cAerodynamic design and analysis on an LFC surface,\xe2\x80\x9d Astronautics and Aeronautics, Vol. 4, No. 7,\n1966.\n[7] Crouch, J., Kosorygin, V., and Ng, L., \xe2\x80\x9cModeling the e\xef\xac\x80ects of steps on boundary-layer transition,\xe2\x80\x9d IUTAM Symposium on\nLaminar-Turbulent Transition, Springer, 2006, pp. 37\xe2\x80\x9344.\n[8] Wang, Y., and Gaster, M., \xe2\x80\x9cE\xef\xac\x80ect of surface steps on boundary layer transition,\xe2\x80\x9d Experiments in Fluids, Vol. 39, No. 4, 2005,\npp. 679\xe2\x80\x93686.\n[9] Perraud, J., and Seraudie, A., \xe2\x80\x9cE\xef\xac\x80ects of Steps and Gaps on 2D and 3D Transition,\xe2\x80\x9d European Congress on Comp.
