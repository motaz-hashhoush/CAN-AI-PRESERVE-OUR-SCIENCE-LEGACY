Each hypothesized the use of a 400-passenger 5500 nautical mile range subsonic commercial LH2 transport. Two of the world's busiest commercial airports, Chicago O'Hare International and San Francisco International, were selected for study. The current and predicted wide-body traffic at these airports was assumed to simulate the LH2 transport traffic at these airports in the 1990-1995 time period. Both studies produced conceptual designs for facilities to generate the required quantities of fuel from pipeline gaseous hydrogen and to deliver liquid hydrogen to the airplanes. Although the LH2 and jet fuel facilities were kept apart, both study teams found it practical to converge the fuel supply lines so that with proper safety and operational procedures and specialized LH2 equipment both LH2 and jet fuel transports can use common ramp and gate facilities.", "title": "Air terminals and liquid hydrogen commercial air transports", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T11:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780058951, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Korycinski, P.
