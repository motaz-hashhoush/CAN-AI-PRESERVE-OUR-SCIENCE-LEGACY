While long surface stay missions exceeding 500 days are the ultimate goal for human Mars exploration, short round trip, short surface stay missions could be an important intermediate step that would allow NASA to demonstrate technology as well as study the physiological effects on the crew. However, for a 1-year round trip mission, the outbound and inbound hyperbolic velocity at Earth and Mars can be very large resulting in a significant propellant requirement for a high thrust system like Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP). Similarly, a low thrust Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) system requires high electrical power levels (10 megawatts electric (MWe) or more), plus advanced power conversion technology to achieve the lower specific mass values needed for such a mission. A Bimodal Nuclear Thermal Electric Propulsion (BNTEP) system is examined here that uses three high thrust Bimodal Nuclear Thermal Rocket (BNTR) engines allowing short departure and capture maneuvers. The engines also generate electrical power that drives a low thrust Electric Propulsion (EP) system used for efficient interplanetary transit. This combined system can help reduce the total launch mass, system and operational requirements that would otherwise be required for equivalent NEP or Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) mission. The BNTEP system is a hybrid propulsion concept where the BNTR reactors operate in two separate modes. During high-thrust mode operation, each BNTR provides 10's of kilo-Newtons of thrust at reasonably high specific impulse (Isp) of 900 seconds for impulsive transplanetary injection and orbital insertion maneuvers. When in power generation/EP mode, the BNTR reactors are coupled to a Brayton power conversion system allowing each reactor to generate 100's of kWe of electrical power to a very high Isp (3000 s) EP thruster system for sustained vehicle acceleration and deceleration in heliocentric space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140009579, "endDate": "2013-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "077f83f3ce734f938ba80f32d04431c6", "id": "5be478aa6fdc411391327039b7a82b16"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "Naperville, IL, United States"}}, "meetingId": "077f83f3ce734f938ba80f32d04431c6", "id": "0baf5f3c6a2f49ec9e77a249abf6863a"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society for Electrical Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "077f83f3ce734f938ba80f32d04431c6", "id": "fdbf63ba16fa4b6e9e8275813cdc23ad"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "077f83f3ce734f938ba80f32d04431c6", "id": "0ecb29ec141a42adbf342e353c1ad7be"}], "name": "International Energy Conversion Engineering Conference", "location": "San Jose, CA", "id": "077f83f3ce734f938ba80f32d04431c6", "startDate": "2013-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}, {"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140009579, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "c2f29aa1c9ae4dfba10c25a91b66f492", "id": "e65fbe24316f457797bcb7daab66b1b4"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "Naperville, IL, United States"}}, "meetingId": "c2f29aa1c9ae4dfba10c25a91b66f492", "id": "72c9b77ec2bb4a2b88a444733913249f"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society for Electrical Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "c2f29aa1c9ae4dfba10c25a91b66f492", "id": "65eb5df889a5477fa28f171ccb75ec85"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "c2f29aa1c9ae4dfba10c25a91b66f492", "id": "56d05ba25833470fb311c586c9dd95b5"}], "name": "AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit", "location": "San Jose, CA", "id": "c2f29aa1c9ae4dfba10c25a91b66f492"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140009579, "id": "20c1e19f4a8d4691842196f46c7007e0", "publicationDate": "2013-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20140009587, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "A One-year, Short-Stay Crewed Mars Mission Using Bimodal Nuclear Thermal Electric Propulsion (BNTEP) - A Preliminary Assessment", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140009579.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140009579/downloads/20140009579.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140009579/downloads/20140009579.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140009579/downloads/20140009579.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
