ABSTRACT\n\nSTAY ALIVE is an idea for a safety awareness simulation prototype, powered by gaming technology, that would make safety training\nenlightening, engaging and fun. Recalling initial instructions and using situational awareness principles, participants would escape a\nfire by choosing the appropriate door. Escape times would be measured while stressors increased. This presentation describes how\nSTAY ALIVE utilizes first person point of view (PoV), a generic scenario, immersion- and presence-enhancing design, and ease of\ndistribution to provide more people opportunity to realize, review, analyze and practice effective awareness behaviors. The goals for\nthis prototype include facilitating interest in first-person PoV safety training and eliciting further suggestions on prevention\ntechnologies.\n\n15.
