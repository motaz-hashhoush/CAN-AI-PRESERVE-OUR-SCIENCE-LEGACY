The Asteroid\nTeam carries out original research on asteroids in order to discover, better\ncharacterize and define asteroid properties. This information is needed for the\nplanning and design of NASA asteroid flyby and rendezvous missions. The Asteroid Team\nalso provides scientific and technical advice to NASA and JPL on asteroid related\nprograms.\nB. PROGRESS: 1) Work on asteroid classification continued and the discovery of two\nEarth-approaching "M" asteroids last year was published. (The M-class is rare and these\nare the first found among the near-Earth asteroids to have the spectral albedo\ncharacteristic of this class. The derived diameters are about 2 km for both objects.)\n2) In the asteroid photometry program we obtained N or Q photometry for more than 50\nasteroids, including the two M-earth-crossers. 3) We have initiated a new program to\nfollow-up on IRAS asteroids at the IRTF. 4 Compositional analysis of infrared spectra\n)\n(0.8 to 2.6pm) of 60 asteroids is continuing. 5) This task supported D. Matson\'s travel\nfor and participation in the NASA Planetary Astronomy Management and Operations Working\nGroup. 6) This task is supporting the preparation of manuscripts for the publications of\nthe IRAS Asteroid and Comet Catalog.\nC.\nPROPOSED WORK: Over the next year the work on asteroid classification and\ncomposition will continue with the analysis of the 60 reduced infrared spectra which we\nnow have at hand. The radiometry program will continue with the reduction of the N and\nQ bandpass data for the 57 asteroids in order to obtain albedos and diameters. This\nyear the emphasis will shift to IRAS follow-up observations; which includes objects n o t\nobserved by IRAS and objects with poor or peculiar IRAS data. As in previous years, we\nplan to give top priority to any opportunities for observing near-Earth asteroids and\nthe support (through radiometric lightcurve observations from the IRTF) of any stellar\noccultations by asteroids for which occultation observation expeditions are fielded.\nSupport of preparing of I U S data for publication and of D. Matson for his participation\nin the NASA Planetary Astronomy Management and Operations Working Group will continue.\nD. SUMMARY BIBLIOGRAPHY: Cruikshank, D.P. and Brown, R.
