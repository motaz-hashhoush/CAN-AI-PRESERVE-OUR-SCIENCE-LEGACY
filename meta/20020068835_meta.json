The data is stored in a DBMS (Data Base Management System). The client asks for the information from the database using an HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) form in a web browser. JavaScript is used with the forms to assist the user and verify the integrity of the entered data. Queries to a database are made in SQL (Sequential Query Language), a widely supported standard for making queries to databases. Java servlets, programs written in the Java programming language running under the control of network server software, interrogate the database and complete a PDF form template kept in a file. The completed report is sent to the browser requesting the report. Some errors are sent to the browser in an HTML web page, others are reported to the server. Access to the databases was restricted since the data are being transported to new DBMS software that will run on new hardware. However, the SQL queries were made to Microsoft Access, a DBMS that is available on most PCs (Personal Computers). Access does support the SQL commands that were used, and a database was created with Access that contained typical data for the report forms. Some of the problems and features are discussed below.", "title": "Database Reports Over the Internet", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T19:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20020068835, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Smith, Dean Lance"}, "organization": {"name": "Memphis Univ.", "location": "Memphis, TN United States"}}, "id": "b3fbc4350ee342329b946660398cb64d"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020068835, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020068835, "id": "8881df948a714d95af9bbf39a445f82a", "publicationName": "Research Reports: 2001 NASA/ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program", "publicationDate": "2002-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20020068792, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Research Reports: 2001 NASA/ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
